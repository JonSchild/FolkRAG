     As I before said, they always had some kind of a 
gambling game going and, if you ever decided to try to play
cotch, which was strictly a New Orleans game, the three card Spanish
poker [&] the deal from the bottom of the deck - the way those 
guys could shove those cards at the bottom of the deck and
pull them--of course you pulled your cards from the bottom--
the dealer - boy, they would have a legay* in no time.
     Of course, among some of those real tough boys there were
men like Chicken Dick. Chicken Dick was a real tough guy, a
wolf. Oh, he was a tough guy, real tough. Had shoulders
on him and arms very much more stronger-looking than Joe Louis.
     Aaron Harris, no doubt, was the toughest of them all. He
was a barroom killer, a very dangerous character that had very
little to say. I know many instances where the policemans 
wanted Aaron but they couldn't afford to say very much to
Aaron unless they intended to kill him, and they was afraid
that if they tried that their life would be in danger. It seemed
like he never missed, any time that he got ready to kill anyone,
man or woman made no difference because he killed
his sister, he would never miss, he'd kill you when he
wanted to.
     Toodoo Parker was also a very tough guy. He was a man 
that you couldn't afford to bother with, but they all respected
Aaron Harris. Sheep Eye was the toughest guy you ever seen in

*Legay (sic), something in cotch. The biggest sum that the spots on
  two cards of the suit add up to. 11 legay is the biggest.
