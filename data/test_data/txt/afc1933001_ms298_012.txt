not to speak of our highly developed urban folk music;
jazz, along with all of its recent rural off-shots.

Narrative songs; ballads of disasters, on
the sea, in the mines, in Indian wars, in floods, in
storms, in railroad and automobile accidents, in ex-
losions, and t is could go on indefinitely. Songs of
bandits beginning with Robin Hood down through Jim
Fiske to John Dillinger.

Last but by no means least either in poetic
or musical content songs of hobos, jail birds, and
all sorts of homeless and lonely men and women.

The next question how much of this material
is available to you and where it is available.

There are now over      books dealing exclusively
with American folk songs. These books contain
anywhere from twenty to over two hundred titles, a
good half of them with music. There's material in these
publications covering almost every category of American
folk song, and a great many of the books are generally
available in any large public library.

There are several hundred persons scattered 
over the whole country who have made intensive collections
of folk songs on their own front door step. Only a small
amount to this material has been published, and I believe
that most of this material has been published, and I believe
that most of the collectors would be happy to assist in
putting that material to use in public school systems.
