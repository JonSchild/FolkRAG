screen" for disguising one's intentions.

Example: A Nazi strategy seems to be the dissemination 
of conflicting rumors in an effort to 
disguise Germany's next move.

III. How may rumors be classified? 
For our purpose we shall classify rumors in respect to 
three variables, the freedom with which a rumor is 
transmitted, the response of the person accepting the 
rumor, and the emotional or affective coloring in the 
rumor.

a. Freedom of dissemination 
1. The covert rumor:  The covert rumor is transmitted 
strictly sub rosa. All public expression 
is prevented either by propriety or authority. 
It never appears over the radio or in the press.

Example: Typical of this class are the 
rumors of the "whispering campaign," stories 
of the sex life of prominent persons, etc. 
Many of the rumors current in the occupied 
countries of Europe, where the press and 
radio are German controlled, also fall into 
this class.

2. The unrestricted rumor: Such rumors are disseminated 
without restraint, over the radio, in 
the press, etc. It is characteristic of these 
that they become more widely disseminated and 
are subject to less distortion than the covert 
rumor.

b. The response of the person believing the rumor 

1.  The non-action compelling rumor: Such 
rumors may be accepted passively by the recipient 
and do not oblige him to desist from or assume 
any course of action. They tend to be wishful or 
hostile in emotional quality.

Example: Rumors regarding the personal life 
of Hitler or the superiority of American 
military equipment over that of the Japanese 
are typical.

2. The action compelling rumor: Such rumors 
present a proposition the acceptance of which 
compels the believer to act. Their emotional 
coloring tends to be one of fear.

Example: Rumors current during panic: of
