that would be very nice."

Mrs. Rogers:  "It's not very pretty singing by itself."

AL:  "No, it's nice, why don't you just hum a bit."

MRS:  "I don't think I can whistle while I work.

AL:  "Well what about one of the tune sa(unintelligible)?"

AL: "No, well I mean, don't you know something (unintelligible) that
you could just hum something?"

MRS:  Will it be on tape? You're not taping this!?

AL:  Yeah!  . . .Tell us what you're doin'

MRS:  I'm batterin' a chicken in flour after I roll it in buttermilk
and egg and now I'm gonna put it in a skillet and let it cook
right slow,  . . . while I'm doin' some other things.

AL:  How many people are you going to feed tomorrow?

MRS:  I don't know how many but I'm gonna do my best to feed a 
good part of them. There'll be a lot of people (?...)

MRS:  Beforehand I baked some pies and cakes because I couldn't wait
til the last minute...now I'm making some slaw and salads and 
congee (??) salad and Igot a baked ham the whole slice. . . how does
that sound? Got some tea or two, a few cokes, pardon me, I'll
cover the chicken now.

AL:  I didn't know that you covered chicken.
