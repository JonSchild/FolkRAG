CHAPTER II

SOCIAL CHANGE IN THE DELTA

Lying between the Mississippi and Yazoo Rivers the Delta extend 
to Memphis, Tennessee in the North and to Vicksburg, Mississippi in 
the South. 1.  It is called "the Delta" because the plain and basin are 
formed by the alluvial deposits of the Mississippi River.  The dwelling 
units of large plantations, sprawling cotton fields, highways 
and telephone poles are the most conspicuous features of the scenery.   
In the Delta counties, over eighty per cent of the agricultural 
acreage is devoted to the production of cotton.

In 1940 the total population of the Delta was 508,022; of the 
total, Negroes comprised roughly 362,000 or seventy two per cent.  2.
Some of the important characteristics of the present day Negro population 
in the Delta are: (1) that more than eighty seven per cent of 
Negro males are engaged in agriculture; (2) that they are predominantly
tenant farmers; and, (3) that they are largely illiterate.

1.  The alluvial plain... contains some of the richest land in the world.  Nearly all of it is bottom land, produced and fed through countless eons by the innundations of the Mississippi River and reclaimed 
for usage by a system of powerful levees that hold the flood 
in check.  The alluvial deposits have been found to be 35 feet deep 
many places" - Federal Writers Project, Mississippi (New York: Viking 
Press, 1938), pp. 31-33.

2.  Thirteen Mississippi counties fall within this area.  They are Warren, Yazoo, Sharkey, Issaquena, Humphreys, Washington, Sunflower, 
Boliver, Coahoma, Tunica, Quitman, Tallahatchie, Leflore. - See Sixteenth Census of the United States, 1940, "Population Characteristics,"
