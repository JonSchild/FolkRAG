  I don't think much of
V-mail, I shall write
a V-mail letter to you
and see how you like it.
     A friend told a young
lady. Your like an ice
box. Why don't you go
down to the Red Cross
Blood  bank? don't give
any of yours though ask
them to give you some.
      The U.S.O. sent me to
a family who had a
spare room.  I hired a taxi
to take me there.  I went
up to the door and said
hello the USO said that
you had an extra room that
I could sleep in tonight.  You
must have the wrong place
they said but come on in, we have
an extra room which you can use.
