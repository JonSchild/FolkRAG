1639 A                   King Porter Stomp
   
King Porter [Stomp] was the first stomp, or the first 
tune with a name "stomp", wrote in the United States.----- 
You must pardon me for clearing my throat. [You see,] I've 
got to do it occasionally.
   
Of course, I [will] tell you the fact about it [myself]. 
I don't know what the name "stomp" means, myself. There 
really wasn't [no] any meaning only that people would stamp their 
feet, and I decided that the name "stomp" would be fitted 
for it. Of course, this tune- I was inspired by the name 
from a very [good] dear friend of mine and a marvelous pianist now 
in the cold, cold ground-a gentleman from Florida- an educated 
gentleman with a wonderful musical education, far much 
better than mine, and this gentleman's name was Mr. King, 
Porter King.
