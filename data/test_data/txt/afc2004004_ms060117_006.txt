The Toasts
Sune goes up, sune goes
down,
That's the way we fish* in
town. Music |
*fishing for girls or money.
Three box of match, Dulcie
can't put in a common
patch

Jerry, gimme piece for some, and I'll give [Jimmie] [gune?]
That's why Coya loves so
much cheap rum
—————
You ain get no more cheap rum from me,
Because you get wet (drunk)
You have on Dr. Jardinie's cheap
white helmet.
