1. I read an article in a magazine which
stated.
  ' A man and his wife picked up
a gypsy women in their car. When
they had reached their destination
the gypsy offered to tell their future.
She said that the war would end
9 months from the day he had a
dead body in the car. On Jan. 23, 1943
they were riding again and came 
upon a accident. The man picked
up a injured lady and put her
in his car. When he reached the
hospital she was dead. According 
to the gypsy the war is to end
Sept. 23, 1943.
