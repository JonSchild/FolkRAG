Dear Ed:
I have had a letter from the Idyllwild Arts Foundation
saying they want Bessie Jones and the Sea Island Singers
in Idyllwild during the summer of 1965 for their Folk
Music Workshop during the first two weeks in July.
This gives us plenty of time to build a tour around
this date.  Do you have any other dates for the group?
Please let me know at once so that I can advise
Idyllwild accordingly, and also let the group have
some idea of what to expect for the summer of that
year, as well as for this summer.
All the best,
Alan Lomax
