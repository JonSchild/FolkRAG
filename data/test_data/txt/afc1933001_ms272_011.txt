DOCTRINE OF THE RAIDER BATTALION

1. We are Raiders of the Land and Sea.
2. We work together for Democracy.
3. Gung Ho! Gung Ho! Gung Ho! Ho!
4. We are tough; we are just;
We fight when e'er we must
for the right to be free.
5. We want to do our duty --
because it's right;
and our duty will give those japs a fright.
6. We execute all orders with a promptitude
That will shatter the Mikado's latitude
7. We are unbeatable - because we're right;
Those Japs can't lick us - for we've got might.
8. We're Raiders - for Democracy.
We work together; that's why we're free.
GUNG HO! GUNG HO! GUNG HO! HO!

CARLSON'S RAIDERS

IN THE MEMORY OF MEN THERE WERE THOSE WHO WERE BRAVE
AND FOUGHT LIKE THE HEROS OF OLD
BUT NONE OF THE FAME WHO CARRY THE NAME
OF CARLSON'S RAIDERS SO BOLD

THEY WERE GATHERED FROM NEAR AND WERE GATHERED FROM FAR
THEY WERE PICKED FROM THE BEST IN THE LAND
A HELL RAISING CREW THAT SAILED THE BLUE
WAS CARLSON'S RAIDER BAND.

THEY CARRY MACHINE GUNS LIKE PISTOLS THEY SAY
AND A KNIFE THAT WAS TEMPERED IN HELL
AND THE RAIDERS ALL CLAIM NO MORTAL BY NAME
COULD USE THEM ONE QUARTER SO WELL

THEY WHISPER OF RAIDERS WHO GAMBLE WITH DEATH
AND FOUGHT LIKE THE DEMONS OF OLD
AND THOSE WHO WERE THERE ARE WILLING TO SWEAR
BY CARLSON'S RAIDERS SO BOLD
