[*I'm turning 
over my old 
papers. F.*]

Dear Alan: if you have 
some friend in New York who can find
out what The American Record
Company has done or is now 
doing with this contract, please
do so. Should  this course not
be possible, put the enclosed
contract into an envelope
and shoot it back to me.
In my final settlement with
Lead Belly I assigned 50% of
this contract to him. I have
only received one report, four
years ago. Yours,
John A. Lomax
