SECRET LOVE
(Germany)

(Page 163 - Folk Songs of Many Peoples, Vol.II.)


No wood fire and no coal flame so burningly glows
As love that is hidden and that nobody knows.


No clove pink and no roses can blossom so fair
As when two true lovers their troth plight shall swear.


In my heart pray set a mirror and therein you'll see
My faith and my worship are only for thee.
