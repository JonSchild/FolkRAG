There was a ship out on the ocean
full of Englishman Americans Italians
and Germans The boat began to sink as it was
overloaded . The captain told the men so an
Englishman stopped up and said "There will
always be an England," and jumped over board
Then an American stepped up and said
 "God bless America," and jumped overboard
Then an German stepped forward and said
"Hiel Hitler" and pushed an Italian overboard
       America and Japan are going to
divide the Pacific Ocean. America is taken
the top and giving Japan the bottom.
   A toast to the Japanese fleet. "Bottoms
Up"

         Hi, ho, hi, ho hi, hi , hi, ho.
