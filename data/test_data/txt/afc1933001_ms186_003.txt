New York, N. Y. 

Dear Madame Comhaire:

I was delighted to learn when I
arrived here on Monday that you plan to
come down again. Allow me to suggest that 
you plan to arrive on Wednesday, September
9th. By that time I should have my affairs 
sufficiently in order so that I can spend
the time with you that I shall wish to.

I look forward to seeing you again.

Most cordially,
