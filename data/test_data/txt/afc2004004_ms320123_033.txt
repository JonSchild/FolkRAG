there was three fellas that started raisin' hell with the
black when they came out of church.  And-so they kept right
on doin' it, and they wouldn't go to church no more, so when
they seen everybody else kept going, they went back to
church.

Tell me something else.  Can you cut just a minute?  Your
whole family, what language did they speak?
CANRAY
French.
A. LOMAX
Your father and mother?
CANRAY
French.
A. LOMAX
Huh?
CANRAY
French.  My daddy didn't. . .oh you could get a knife and get
ready to cut his neck if you'd a said that in that English.
He didn't know what you was talking about.  Uh-uh, he didn't
know a thing in English.  Oh no, he couldn't even go nowhere
and ask for a plate of food in English.  My mama could speak
a little bit.  And when I started, all I knew was French.
But once I got in school, them teachers didn't want us to
speak French.  Whenever they would catch somebody speaking
in French at school there they would go an whip 'em or
punish them bad about that.  That's how come it has done got
to be why the French and English was. . .but I taught all my
children French, all of my-expect the baby.  She understand
French, but she can't speak like them other.  I told-I told
my wife I said:  "I'm gonna teach them children how to speak
French.  They can learn English."  Which they did, too.
All them oldest ones, I got five of them there.  They can
speak just as good or better than I do.
A. LOMAX
Why did you want 'em to speak French?
CANRAY
Well, 'cause I could where it was gettin' where it wasn't
