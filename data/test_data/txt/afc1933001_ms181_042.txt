Dear Bob:

Would you be kind enough to find out for me when your
twelve-inch record of "Pretty Polly", Victor No. 35838B,
sung by B. F. Shelton, was released? I need this information
for preparation of some scholarly notes. Of course, the 
year would be sufficient for my purposes. I believe you
told me once before that this record had been discontinued. 

By the way, why don't you make a dubbing of it and
bring it out on Red Seal. I believe it would sell. It is
by far the best folk performance on a commercial record.

It would be nice to see you sometime.

Best regards,
