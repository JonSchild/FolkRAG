Many rooms, two or three. [*My*]
My mother had thirteen in our family [page torn]
died & that left nine.

But my old man, I used to go along with him
everywhere. I was his boy. When I was about that
height [*I used to go along with him.  we*] I used
to go along with him onto Barton Broad after
fish.  Used to have a net. Oh, I used to go
everywhere.  He's play a fiddle up nights at the 
"Wheat Harvest". [*?*]
He used to play there every
Saturday night. Get a shilling or two for his time
and a pint or 2 o' beer.
I used to sit up in the window board, little old boy
I was.  I'd get my feet down between people's backs.
I heard 'em singing the songs, though of course, I wasn't
old enough to pick 'em up.  I took delight in hearing
them.  If there was anybody singing these old songs I'd
sit there for a week. My ears are open!"

POACHING SONG
But father done a little roughin' around, & he
was a poachin man, too. He used to like that
game. He used to like to go after the old hares,
gunnin'.  He used to lay his hares in Barton
Church porch.  He shot many a hare in the
churchyard.  Nobody'd ever go in after them he
reckoned.  There wasn't one out of 20 darest go
into the churchyard o' night, dead o' night. I 
don't think he was afraid of anything. I never
knew no one to frighten him. He'd go anywhere.
