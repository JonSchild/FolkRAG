My supply of records having run out, my work for the evening 
was over.  [Ixxxxz] Theoline invited Dr. Reiser,  [xxx another visitor 
and Cecile who was present] and myself into her rest-house, where we sat and drank
 rum and kola for a few xxxxxx minutes.  [Besidesxourselvesx] The 
dance went on uninteruptedly [for] outside and when I staggered 
wearily home a few minutes later and fell into bed the drums 
were still honoring the gods in the Haitian fashion.  I woke next 
morning about dawn  and listende for nearly an hour to the rise and
fall of the dance music that came from the tonnelle.  The dance had, 
as is usual with on Saturday night, lasted all night long, [although] 
Doubtless the older people had long ago gone home and only the 
young men and women could still be found moving about the enter 
post of the tonnelle and, now that the restraining influence 
of the old heads no longer held them in check, [would the ] staggering 
about in pretended possession [and bumping into each other for their own pleasure] so as to bump pleasurably 
into one another . 
      After my experience[,] with other groups of singers 
and at other dances, I should say that this vaudou dance was 
[aboutxthexxusual] a rather ordinary affair.  There were no 
great number of visitors present, as there would have been at any 
important dance.  There was no particular intensity about the 
whole thing and there were few possessions and none of them very 
long lived.  This description is a far cry from Seabrook and 
perhaps [leanx x is] a little lean on the side of [descriptionxand]
color and sinister suggestion, but I believe it is a more acurate 
picture of vaudou cult activity.
