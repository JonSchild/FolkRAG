Dear Alan:
I have just received inquiry from Prof. Arthur Posnansky,
Casilla de Correos 139, La Paz, Bolivia, about getting a recording
machine, blank disks, (he doesn't say how many), & 3,000 feet of blank
film, black & white (he doesn't say whether 16mm. or 35 min.) in order to record
a folk drama, "The Last of the Incas," to be performed by Bolivian Indians
in [Quime] La Joya on Dec. 8th (Catholic festival of the Conception). He is one of my
livest folklore contacts in Bolivia & folkdrama (the real stuff) down there,
as here, is getting to be rather rare, so I suggest you contact him air mail
at once & I recommend you help him if possible. There still remain 
2 1/2 months to ship him a recording machine, if you can lend him one. 
He seems disposed to pay for the disks & films. He is not a poor professor
but a big shot there and apparently rather well off. He says he saw this 
folk drama several years ago in Quime & it was so moving that the Indians
wept when it was played, & he intends to go see it again this year, since
he has heard it is to be given at La Joya Dec. 8th & doesn't know if it
will ever be given again. This seems like a good chance to me, & I shall
appreciate any help you can give him. May be you could lend the recorder
thru our Ministry there, so as to be sure to get it back. Posnansky is about 
as good as could be gotten there to do the job.
Best wishes,
R S Boggs
