Letter of Mr. John A. Lomax
to the Carnegie Corporation, 11/26/35

The attached letter came this morning from Mr. Lomax. Instead of
addressing his report to you or to me he has sent it directly to Mr.
Lester. The facts and figures contained in it agree, however, with our
records, excepting that in his second paragraph Mr. Lomax should have referred, not to "300 records deposited in 1934," but to "280 records deposited in 1934 and earlier." The total should accordingly read 541, not
561.
