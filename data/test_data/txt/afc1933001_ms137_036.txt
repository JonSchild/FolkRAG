Mr. Alan Lomax
General Delivery
Escanaba, Michigan

Dear Alan: 
     Mr. Voorus has asked me to return the
enclosed voucher to you to be notarized.
He also has a few notes attached which, I 
think, are self-explanatory when I tell
you that there is a discrepancy between your
last voucher and this one on the mileage.
Your last meter readings at Lake Williams,
Mich. was 59,930 and this voucher begins at
Detroit, Mich. with 60, 592. What about the
missing 662 miles?
     All good wishes!
          Sincerely,


               Secretary, Division of Music
