Ain' No Need Your Bowin' Down on Yo' Knees

Lead Belly, asked about the origin of this song, said,
I was tryin' myse'f out on de guitar one night in
de Lou'siana pen and things begin jumpin' up in
my head an' I made me this blues."
The melody he could never remember after he sang it the first time
and so he told us to put to any blues air that we liked. Here is
a blues that, except for the "Po' boy a great long
ways f'om home" theme, [sums up] includes in five stanzas all the important
blues' attitudes.
