Many, many public libraries are forming " Listening Groups" 
for both music and discussion. Here in New York, we have
leaders for these groups who gather in our auditoriums,
- members of our Music Division staff for music both 
broadcast and recorded, and trained reference librarians 
for the discussion groups. Both here and in the small 
towns, the p ossibilities are very great for making up 
programs that have integrity and that lead somewhere. 
Don't you think so ?
For the children and young people we are 
particularly anxious to use good recordings and to 
"tie them in" to good books. So much has been published
in these last years that truely represents our own American 
scene.  If you can come, we can assure you a deeply interested
audience.
Will you let me know just as soon as possible ?
always sincerely yours
