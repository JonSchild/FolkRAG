(AL) engagement of people to the affairs of the heart -- called
them "old-time love-song."  The religious part of the
community was opposed to them, because their belief, their
Calvinist tradition, that if you devoted yourself to the
Lord, you should put out of your life everything that didn't
pertain to the affairs of the church.  But Cass Wallin doesn't
believe that.
Cass:  But they begin to come to it, the old people does now,
since they read the Bible a whole lot, and since I'd get into
an argument with 'em, you know, I'd go over to these places,
I was with churchmen, and they'd say something about it to
me, and I'd tell 'em that love meant all things -- without
love, Christ was love, and a man and wife, when they're
married, supposed to be love.  They marry them in the church 
now, when they say it's a court of religion -- have to be
both Christian before they can marry. . . . (unint). .But I don't
think so -- when anybody loves one another, wh y, that's it.
AL:  It's only fairly recently that the church considered itself
a sponsor of marriage.  Sometime in the Middle Ages the
Church took marriage over, and declared that unless a marriage
was sanctified in the Church, it wasn't legal.  But we still
have some people here and there, and some communities here and
there in our world that haven't agreed to that, and think that
marriage is a (unint) of the troth between two people.  We've
run into the spirit of that with Mr. Wallin.  Let's hear
some more songs.  (TECHNICAL)
