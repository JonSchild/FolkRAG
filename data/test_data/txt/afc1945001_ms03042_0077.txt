-3- Rumors, 8-9 to 8-13    New York    8-18-42

New York 8-10 (Negro porter): "If I were an Indian, I would let the Japs in. Is it not better to be ruled by a member of a colored race than by a member of the white race? Only white men think they are entitled to walk over the backs of the men of other races." (This Negro porter attended New York University and received his A. B.)
Brooklyn 8-13: "In 1776 we fought off the red coats, and I'll be damned if we're going over to their side in this Indian business. The Indian people have a right to govern themselves as they want to."
New York 8-11 (Bartender): "I've heard any number of soldiers say they would drop their guns if they were ever put up against those Indians in a revolution. The British had ought to let the people vote to see whether they want to be independent."
New York 8-15 (German-American): "Wait until you see how many thousands of men were killed trying to take those Solomon Islands for the British. Every man an American, too. No British soldiers are anywhere near."
Long Island City 8-14 (Hungarian-American): "Answer me this -- why do we waste thousands of lives to capture some British imperial property in the Solomon Islands instead of striking into Europe with a second front? Because the British tell us what to do, and they would rather capture new islands than help the Russians."

Russia
New York 8-13 (Taxi driver): "I hear Stalin has handed out an ultimatum which says if we don't open a second front in two weeks he will sign a peace with Hitler. I wouldn't put it past him."
New York 8-13 (College teacher): "There's something to this talk about Russia making a separate peace. There must be something to it because you hear it everywhere."
