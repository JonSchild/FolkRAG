N. Y.'s Most Comple[?]
TV KEY PREVIEWS OF TOP AT[?]
(Today's top TV programs as seen at
rehearsals and screenings by TV KEY,
an independent preview organization.)

4:00-4:30 P.M. (4) and (7) - President Kennedy. The
Presidents news conference will be carried
live at this time. It will also be carried on tape
by Channel (2) at 5:00 P.M., also at 11:10 P.M.
(5), 12:15 A.M. (9).

7:30-8:00 P.M. (2) - Accent. "The Golden Isles:
Cradle of American Song." A contagious and
hypnotic half hour of the beat, the rhythm,
and excitement of the African-American folk
song at its source. Guest musicologist Alan
Lomax is a particularly charming guide on
this tour of the Isolated Golden Isles off the
coast of Georgia, where the descendants of
the last African slaves still work, dance, play,
and go to church to the rhythm of their traditional
songs. Tune in for the unaccompanied 
performance of the Buzzard dance, the sea
chanty, the church song, the children's song,
and more, and you'll recognize the origin of
the jazz forms of today.
