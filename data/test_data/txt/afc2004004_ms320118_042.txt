Tape:  1313 Octa Clark   1
(2 minutes into  tape, Alan and Octa out on lawn)
AL:  So you've been your own man standing on your own
ground looking after your family. . . .how old were you when
you got married . . . . . .
Octa:  I get married when I was 26. . . .
AL:  And you were born. . 
Octa:  1904
AL:  You don't look that old, and last night you were. . . .
Octa:  Not outside, inside. . . .sure, I'm over 79.
AL:  This is Octa Clark, who is considered by many of the
people who care deeply for the Cajun music tradition to be
one of the very finest classical musicians in the field.
One who keeps the old music, keeps building it beautifully,
doesn't let the feeling die, but stays to the true old way,
isn't that right?
(Then they walk out to swing by road)
Octa:  That's the swing, I take it easy right there. . . .I was
sitting here, and they came by and said you take a break?  I
said, yeah, a little break.  He said, a little break?  I say
no, A big break.  Break all day.  It's cool out here.  It's a 
good place.
AL:  Vous avez les reves beaucoup? (Doyou dream much.)
Octa:  Oh, every night.  A lot.
AL:  Les memes choses beaucoup des fois?  (Do you dream the
same thing many times?)
