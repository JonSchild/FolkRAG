Mr. William C. Haygood
February 8, 1943

     The fellows I am about to suggest are admirably
equipped to assist in this plan. I have, by the way, discussed 
this approach with Raper, Margaret Mead, Lewis Jones and many
others interested in the whole questions of developing a better
understanding of wartime issues among isolated groups of
Americans.

     1) James Harrison Pipes, University of Michigan. (See
enclosure A.) Mr. Pipes was recommended to me by President Bond
of Fort Valley State College. My correspondence with him has
encouraged me to believe that he is a competent and intelligent
folklorist.

     He wishes to make a study of the modern Negro Holiness
Church in the South. As you know, this group since about 1890
has grown rapidly all over the United States, attracting membership
from the more staid Negro congregations, carrying forward
and elaborating the traditional patterns of the Negro folk church.
In this church or, one might say, galaxy of churches, the members
continue to sing old time shouting spirituals, to manifest their
conversion by speaking in tongues and by prophecy, etc., to
"shout" in the aisles and to become possessed in the traditional
pattern of the West African Negro. Very little, however, is
known about the actual structure and history of this religious
group, its relationship to other church groups, and its general
affect on life in the Negro community. I know, of course, of
the excellent WPA study in Chicago. Mr. Pipes' work in the
South will supplement this and complete the picture.

     Mr. Pipes, by working in Memphis where Elder Mason,
the head of the largest of these groups flourishes, and by
carrying his investigation out through the Mississippi Valley
region will, in a year, be equipped to describe this extremely
significant group, which, in a sense, represents the folk
Negro's attempt to adjust his oral religious tradition to the
needs and pressures of modern living. At the same time, he
could be of enormous service to me in collecting wartime folklore
and possibly even in contacting church leaders in regard
to war information problems. His fellowship might well amount
to $2,500 so that he would have funds for recording and a 
certain amount of travel.
