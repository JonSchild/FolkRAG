            The Committee on Communications and Public Opinion was established
in the early spring of this year as an official part of the University of

social scientists in this institution and directing it to the study of the

and unskilled laborers, small merchants, entrepreneurs, and large employers;

familiarity which far surpasses the knowledge of the Chicago area possessed
by any other set of people. In addition, these studies have enabled us to
build up an organization equipped to undertake new studies with a maximum
