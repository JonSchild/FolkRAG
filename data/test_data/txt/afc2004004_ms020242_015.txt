BJ: I ha -- I, I stayed there that whole winter...
TL: And never did come back, huh?
BJ: He didn' come back. They ha-- they walked the house. They
never did come in there no more. But I, I went in that room the
next day an' just put down shoe soles an' ah, an' burn' 'em, 
ya know? Just burnt, burnt shoe soles an' all like that. An'
that gun an' ah, sulphur an' stuff, just sprinkle it all in that
room. An' so that's all I did. 
     An', anyway, about, I guess about a week later, one day,
there's some boys, ah, comin' there from her lot. They want me
to go to see this show, ov-over another town, over far. Not, not
far, na-oh what they [ah] call it? Oh, ah, tsk, the ah Captain of Meldon. Not, the
name -- what ya call it?
AL: Annapolis.
BJ: Annapon, that's right. They, they want me to go over there
with them s--, an' so, they come down there in the daytime. An'
that's when Mom an' them knowed I was home. An' they come down
there; had to shevel (shovel) snow to git in there, ya know, ta, 
an' then when they come I, I got ready an' jus' go on out. An'
Mom went to hollerin', "Where you holed in?" They didn' know
where...
I said, "I been here. I been here ever, ah, since the
peoples lef' in November, huh!" See? Had been there then.
TL: How late was it?
BJ: Ah, that was up in Jan', -- ah, yeah, up in January. Ha, ha!
Spent the whole Christmas. 'Cause I spent the Christmas over there
in, in her lot with, with Diamond an' them, ya know? But they
didn' know I was there. But they was there, an' they was outdone!
