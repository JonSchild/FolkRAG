SKYE BOAT SONG
Words by Miss Margaret Bain. Dec. 1893

Refrain
Waft him ye winds, far away oer the sea
Far from a traitor's eye
Fly little boat that our prince may be free
Over to loyal Skye

What though the storm, rave through the air
Storms cannot daunt the brave
Spared from the fight, Charlie will dare
Wrath from the angry wave

2.
Fortune may frown, traitors may wrong
Fortune we will defy
Hearts are aye true, hands are aye strong
Ready to do or die

3.
Come yet again, Charlie we pray,
Honour is left us still
Scotland shall n'er tarry a day
Conquer we must and will
