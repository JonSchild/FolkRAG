(15)  I talked with another filling station operator and he
stated that many operators and car dealers had accummulated the
best second hand tires and had stored them in the attics of their
homes.  This has caused the shortage of second hand tires on the
market. 

(16)  I talked with a lady who holds a very responsible
administrative job with the government and she said that the CPA
set-up in Virginia was entirely political and that it was not only
her opinion but that it was common knowledge that politics were the
first consideration. 

(17)  I talked with a Captain at the Army induction station and
he said that there was a definite feeling among many people that
we were fighting a Jew war and that the Jews were using all their
influence possible to get into units of the Army other than combat
units. 

Generally, I have heard many rumors as to the cost of living and
apparent disregard for price ceiling.  I have also heard many rumors
criticizing the various programs that have started and have not been 
carried through.  I know that there are many cases where gas coupons
are swapped and traded.  These are facts and a general investigation
and enforcement should be put into effect at once by the CPA.
