3)  "I widna fancy you, kind sir,
Nor let me shearing be-o.
And I maun allow to be the Lady o' drum,
And your miss I scorn to be-o."

4)  "But if ye'll gang to my father dear  -
He's a shephard on yonder hill-o.
And if he gives ye his consent
I will marry at his will-o."

5)  For he has gane to her father's knee,
Shephard on yonder hill-o.
"I have come for to marry your daughter fair,
If ye'll gie her your good will-o."

6)  "My daighter canna read or write,
To school she's never been-o.
But weel can she take a coggie on her knee
And she can milk the cow-o."

7)  She can bake your brad, aye, and brew your ale,
And gang to the mill and carl-o,
And in time of need she can saddle your steed,
And aye can draw your boots hersel'-o,"

8)  "But ya'll take off the dull grey goon,
Put on the silks and scarlets-o.
And if you'll gang wi' me to the Castle o' Drum,
You'll never be maid or harlot-o,"

9)  Four and twenty noblemen
Stood at the gates of the Drum-o.
But nae a man lifted off his hat
When the Ladu o' Drum come in-o.

10)  Up and spoke his brother dear,
And an angry man was he-o.
"Ye hae married a wife below your degree,
You're a disgrace to our kin-o."

11)  But if ye was dead and I was dead,
And in the long grave laid-o.
Gin seven long years were passed and gone,
Wha's to ken his dust frae mine-o."
