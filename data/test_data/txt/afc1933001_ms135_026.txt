Mr. Alan Lomax,
Asst. in Charge, Archive of American Folk Song,
Library of Congress,
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sir:

Your letter of July 1st was received several days ago,
and I am a little late in replying.

Sidney Robertson wrote me a few days ago that you
would be coming, and I just wrote her tonight that
I would be glad to help all I possibly could.
I am trying to get a list from her of the songs
recorded for her by our people last summer. I don't 
s uppose you would want to repeat them - or would you?
Also asked her for a list of some of the songs she wanted
to get from us. Would like very mush to have those
lists from her before making further recordings.

To make much progress, it would be best to plan on
my being with you hereabouts over a week end, because
my work keeps me busy for long hours each day during 
the week, and sometimes during the evenings. That is 
unfortunate because I enjoy helping gather up these
old songs. I have somewhat of a collection - words only,
of my own.

Will write you again as soon as I hear from Sidney,
but if you have your plans made to come up this way
very soon, we will do the best we can whenever you
arrive.    You can locate me at the Hotel Gordon, Laona, 
Wis.

Yours very truly,

AJ Ford.
