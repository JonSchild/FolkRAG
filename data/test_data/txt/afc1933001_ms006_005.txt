I have other songs which are certainly indigenous, but 
about their currency and popularity throughout the country,
I know absolutely nothing. There is one called "Mary Brade",
which commences:
The stars are out, the moon is bright,
and the lark is singing free x (!)
come listen while I sing about 
My old brown coat and me.

IT is a story of a "proud beauty" who rejected her poor suitor, and

Another song, of Civil War times, is on the theme of a dying 
soldier's last words. It contains the lines:

called "The Bear in the Hill", which has to do with the courtship and
