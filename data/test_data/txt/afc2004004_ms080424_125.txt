TAPE:  R-82 cont.    6

So back down and forth he went and I walked down the road
and it done got dark and it's coming on darkness, dark enough
that he had on his headlights, and I flashed him down, and said
how about driving me home.  He came home and Bud spent the night
there andhunting me in the swamp. . . . . .that was my first and last
hunting with neighbors. . . . .
Int:  asks about fastest dog. . . . .
Man:  The best dog I ever owned was old Mouthy(?). He could
run a rabbit, Lord have mercy.  Nobody wanted to run with hem.
They all said he'd outdo theirs, naturally, they didn't want
to run.  I kept him about 5 years, couldn't run him, nobody'd
run with him, so I had to get rid of him.
Man:  Mouthey's the best dog you ever did see?
Man:  Best dog in this country. . . . .
Man:  One man's opinion--lot of men's opinion--where did he
get his mouth?  How come they call him Mouthey?
Man:  He was mouthey, he was mouthier than an old rabbit. . . . . . ,.
Man:  Well, the best. . . .I tell you, I'd like to tell youone
about Bud. When we went downto south Georgia, and I done killed
about 7 or 8 rabbits and ole Bud hasn't even killed a rabbit.
. . . .and I sat down. . . .no, you hadn't killed a rabbit, and I
said, get ready Bud, I'm gonn a run one right at you. . . . .
and Bud went, pow, pow, pow, three times. . . . and Bud said, did
you kill that rabbit?. . . . . . .laughing, break in tape.
