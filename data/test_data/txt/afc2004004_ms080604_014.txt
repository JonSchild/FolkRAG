know whether you saw it or not, but you'd better dump it
where that clod fell.
A.L.:  
What would they do to you?             

B.G.:  
Put that club on you.

W.B.:  
Put that root club to you.

B.G.:  
He had a stick about three feet long (spreads
his arms), and a big knot on the end of it.  He'd have it
layin down there all the time, and he'd just throw that clod
a dirt, and you better straddle it -- he never say gee or haw-
- he just throw that clod a dirt an you got to straddle it.

W.B.:  
And then the average spotter's song. . .
(begins singing:)
                        I tell my wife an baby
                        Whoa, they can't look for me.
                        I got a long holdover,
                        And I may not never go free.

(speaking):       And they was already free.

(singing:)         And I may come limpin',
                        And I may come lame,
                        And I may come toppin'
                        Some long freight train.

(speaking:)      And they would tell you then, "Gee a little
bit, -yeah; gee a little bit, -yeah.", for come back short
all.

A.L.:  
That'd be the spotter singin' then. . .

W.B.:  
That'd be the spotters.

A.L.:  
And how many people would be singin at one
time?  Would everybody. . .
