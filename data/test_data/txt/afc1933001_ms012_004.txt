Mr. John A. Lomax,
Honorary Curator and Consultant,

Washington, D.C.

My dear Sir:
   
Dr. Bixby, Assistant Director of Prisons, has forwarded 
to me your request for information relative to Folk
Songs among inmates of penal institutions.
   
I have made careful inquiry among the men here and
have had the man in charge of the band make further inquiry,
and it seems that we have no such songs current in
this institution.
   
It would appear to me that the songs really prevalent
are those songs of passing popularity which come to us over
the radio. It would appear to me that the advent of radio 
in penal institutions will have the effect of eliminating 
the type of songs of which you inquire.
                                            
Respectfully yours,
J. Herbert Geoghegan,
J. Herbert Geoghegan,
Supervisor of Education.
