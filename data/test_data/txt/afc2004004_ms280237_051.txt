I took a stroll with this pretty fair maid,
An' a gentleman passin' us by,
I knew she meant a doin' for him
By the look of her roguish black eye.

His watch she took from his pocket
An' placed it right into my hand,
And the very next thing that I said, was,
"Bad luck to the black velvet band."

This is the chorus.

Her eyes they shone like diamonds,
I thought her the queen of the land,
And her hair hung over her shoulders
Tied up with a black velvet band.

Before the judge an' jury
Next morning' I had to appear,
The judge he said to me, "Young man,
Your case to you is proved clear."

"We'll give you seven year penal servitude,
To be sent right away from your land,
Far away from your friends an' relations,
Betrayed by the black velvet band."

So come all you jolly young fellers,
I'll have you take warnin' by me,
Mind what you - when you are out on the liquors, my boy,
Beware of your pretty colleen.

They'll treat you to strong drink, my boys,
Till you are onable to stand,
And before you have time to leave them
They'll land you in Van Dieman's Land.
