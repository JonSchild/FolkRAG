these turpentine men would come into town --what they'd called
town -- would be Biloxi or Gulfport or one of those little
ocast (sic) towns -- they’d always start maybe gambling
and Georgia Skin was no doubt the main game. Of all the
games in history that I've ever seen, I've never seen one game
for so many different kinds of cheats right in front of
your eyes.  It'll take a magician to even catch 'em, maybe
not even him, he couldn't catch 'em maybe

Anyway, Harry Dunn was supposed to be the best.  He
was a tall, lanky fellow -- very thin and had a very nice dis-
position with a smile -- he was light in complexion.  And somehow
or other he seemed to like me very much and he told me, "Some
day I'm going to make a gambler out of you."  And of course,
that interested me because I wanted to have the other young
fellows that was out of my class beat.  And he used to teach
me day by day when he wouldn't go out to meet what you call
a “pay day".  Meeting a "pay day" means that he is going to
bring the bacon home -- win all the money from the people that
has worked.
Well, Harry taught me a few things about the Georgia
Skin game, such as a few hole-out cubs, they call 'em.  A
cub is something where you have three cards where it's im-
possible for this card to come out of the deck, and, of course,
these cards are in the party's hand that's playing the
other card and in that case you can never lose, but, of course,
it's very dangerous of you're not able to get the cards back
