And Irishman toast

Heres to stars and stripes of 
America
And hers to the blue bells of 
Scotland.
And hers to strong walls of 
great britan.
And hers to the blue birds of 
Ireland which flew all
over the strong walls of 
great britan lite all over the 
blues bells of Scotland and 
wipe her ass with the stars 
and stripe of America.
