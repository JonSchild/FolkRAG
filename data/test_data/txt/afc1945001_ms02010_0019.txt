         (d) A few can be classified only as "supernatural rumors";
               these contain fantastic prophecies of disaster or impending      
               miracles.
         (e) Finally, there are a substantial number of "curiosity rumors," 
               which contain amusing or novel tid-bits or supposed "news."

         [*Hate Rumors are most dangerous insult from page II*].   The evidence shows clearly that many "hate-rumors" originate in the United States as symptoms of domestic social and economic problems - especially those problems which war creates or intensifies.
Enemy propaganda has often picked up these rumors and tried to increase their circulation as an essential part of the strategy of "divide and conquer."   
         But enemy shortwave radio broadcasts, [which] reach a very small  audience in the United States, [*and*] have largely been ignored by the American public.
          A list of the groups against which most current "hate-rumors"
are directed follows, in alphabetical order:

                 Army administration       Labor
                 Business                            Negroes
                 Catholics                            Profiteers
                 Defense workers              Rationing Boards
                 Draft Boards                      Red Cross [*(blood donor service)*]
                 English                                Russia
                 Farmers                              Unions
                 Jews
                 
           The false information carried by "hate-rumors" is less important
than the hatred which the rumors convey. Factual denials appear to have
had little effect in stopping "hate-rumors." As one "hate-rumor" is exposed, 
it is replaced by another rumor conveying the same hatred.
It seems clear that persons who feel certain hatreds will readily believe
and repeat any rumor which gives expression to that hatred. "Hate-rumors" obviously must be attacked at the source - by curing the cause of the hatred.
