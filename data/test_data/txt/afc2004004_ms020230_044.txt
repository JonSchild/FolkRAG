my bed, I can git out an' come right to the stove.  You know, I. . .
TL:    There was a stove in these places?
BJ:    Oil stove.
TL:    Oil stove?
BJ:    Oil stove.  I, ah. . .
TL:    Is that what people cook on?
BJ:    Yeah.  That's what I cooked on.  An' many of 'em cooked on
a oil stove an' many of 'em cooked outdo's.  A lot of 'em.
TL:    They cooked outdoors over an open fire?
BJ:    Open fire, um-hum.  Many of 'em, cooked outdo's.  An' then
they build a tin, some, like -- 'cause I have did it -- build
tin over the top of the place, ya know?  Make ya a stove in there.
My husban' made a beautiful one.
TL:    Did he really?
BJ:    Um-hum.  An' then made a big one.  [Oh] Oven.
TL:    Oven?
BJ:    Yeah.
TL:    Was there any kind of family trouble by so many people
being in the same place?
BJ:    No, I have -- I ain' heard of none.  No more'n the folks what
does git high an' drunk; nobody don't [care nothin' 'bout it.] pay 'em no mind.
What I mean, there wasn' no killin' scrapes an' no -- You know,
there's always a dispute between some folks some time, but jus'
say far as a great, sincerely thing, at that time I ain't seen nobody [at that
time] have nothin' in that time.  Peoples -- I'll tell ya what:
I believe it's just like, I look, looks into that an' think about
it.   Ah, when, when, um, you, ah, have your chickens out here in
the yard, maybe.  And oftentimes ya got to stop 'em from fighting,
the chickens, ya know?  An' ah, but, you catch all those chickens
