Dear Elizabeth:

Your letter of October 27 addressed to Harold has been 
referred to me.  I have looked in the obvious places, such as 
the Publications of the Pennsylvania-German Folklore Society 
and the Texas Folk-Lore Society and the Journal of the 
American Folklore Society for German-American folk songs without 
success.  What I have found is probably hot exactly what you 
want:  the lullaby, "Schlof, Bobbeli," in A Treasure of American 
Song, by Olin Downes and Elie Siegmeister; three Pennsylvania-
German folk songs in English, in Pennsylvania Folk Songs and 
Ballads for School, Camp, and Playground, Pennsylvania Folk 
Festival (George Korson, Director); a book of German-English 
Christmas Songs, compiled by Herbert H. Wernecke (Webster 
Groves, Mo.); and four German folk dances, in Dances of the 
People, by Elizabeth Burchenal (C. Schirmer).  As you know, the 
Library cannot photostat copyright material without the written 
authorization of the copyright owner.

On records we have a couple of German folk songs recorded 
in Michigan by Alan and a number of Amish, Mennonite, and 
Lutheran hymns (in German) recorded in Iowa by Marcus Back.  If 
you are interested in these, you could order duplicates.

Alan's new assignment, of which I had heard, sounds exciting 
indeed.  News of the "new arrival" would be even more exciting.

If I can be of further help, please let me know.

With best wishes,

Sincerely yours,

B. A. Botkin
