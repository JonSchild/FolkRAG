It was no more than a daisy
in a bull's mouth - made
a nudge in the Glen mead. 

You could lead me there with
a halter of snow - anxiousness
kilt untimely. He was breathing for all the
world like a corpse

1/2 nothing
-
You could dance the  - on a spider's 
web without breaking it. 

Bad crop - Put the best man 
to dig um and a duck cd swallow
all [you] he could tow out from 
morning till night. 

Not another word out of you or I'll
stick you like a pig & give you your
guts for garter

He died roaring like Doran's 
bull -   -
like a hen on a hot griddle
