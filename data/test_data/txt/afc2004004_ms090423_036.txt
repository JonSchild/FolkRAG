 Hymns

I'm going to rest with Jesus
Lord when I've done the best I can
I'm sending up my timber
The Day of Jubilee
How sweet the Name of Jesus sounds
Come ye that love the Lord
The Old Rugged Cross
Have a little talk with Jesus
I've heard of a land
There's a happy land of Promise
Precious Memory
On Jordan's stormy banks
Just a closer walk with Thee
What a friend we have in Jesus
My faith looks  up to Thee
God be with you till we meet again
