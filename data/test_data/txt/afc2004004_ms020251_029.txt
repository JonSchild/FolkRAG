Reel of 10/4/61, Side 1, Song 12

'GATOR
This is just a little play song that comes from St. Simons Island.
I don't know all of it.  The words mean they're going to make a lot
of money and carry it back to the Island, carry it back to their
gal.  A lot of folks eat Alligator tail, and the song means they
are going to have a big alligator party.

REFRAIN:
I'm gonna get me a 'gator,
Oh, gal,
I'm gonna come off the Island, (REFRAIN)
I'm gonna bake him and fry him, (REFRAIN)
When I come off the Island, (REFRAIN)
I'm gonna get me a 'gator, (REFRAIN)
I like a big, bold 'gator (REFRAIN)
I'm gonna get me a 'gator (REFRAIN)
That big, bold 'gator, (REFRAIN)
When I come off the Island, (REFRAIN)
I'm gonna come off the Island, (REFRAIN)
