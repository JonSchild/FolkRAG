show with RoseinBrown - first of San Antonia stocks - inexperienced players -
sisters grabbed parts and show failed - ( harmonica, jewsharp, single
guitar, mandolins, one decent piano player in  town.  Carrie Huff of Zipp's
Alley where JR stopped, beat up Rosie Brown - made friends with Tom Sulsky-
door to door until job a sporting house. Piano players were terrible.
Yiddisher Rag, Gabby Glide, etc. - told JR a fellow had gone to the Boston
Concervatory, named Roash.  I knew him hog-hunting - Roach turned
out to be worse than any of them.  Brownsville to see Bullfight -- to
Houston and played in Thelma Dentam place.  Had so much business had to
enlarge the place - only decent piano there was Fred Washington (ragtime)
now in Calif. -- taught two boys to play.  Selected to play for the new
Airdrome theatre opening up.  Picked up very bad drum, trombone,
clarinet, and other odds and ends.  Carter Moseby with me.  Not too
good a drummer.
