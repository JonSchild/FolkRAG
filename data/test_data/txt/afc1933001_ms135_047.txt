Dr. Robert D. Mackenzie,

Ann Arbor, Mich.

Dear Dr. Mackenzie:

The archive of American folk-song plans to make,
during the months of August and September, a preliminary
survey of the folk music of Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota.
The work is to be done with a portable instantaneous
field recording machine. Dr. Royce has suggested that you
might be interested in helping me find any communities, either
foreign or native where interesting specimens of folk music
might be obtained.

I will appreciate whatever suggestions you may make.

Sincerely,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in charge
Archive of American
Folk-song.
