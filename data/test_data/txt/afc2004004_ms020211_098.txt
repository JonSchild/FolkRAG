Dear Mable, Bessie and John,

I have no special news for you except for two things:
(1)  The Minnesota firm has asked for an option on your
time for this fall, which I gave them.  This means
that they are trying to get you a series and will let
us know when.  (2)  Newport is planning a concert series
for New York, Boston and Philadelphia next year and
I am trying to get them to include you.  Otherwise there
is no news except that I am working my head off and am
really out of the folk song booking field.  I can't
understand why you aren't being asked for more dates
but I will keep trying whenever I can to push you.
I will write to the German firm that offered you $50
and ask them to give you $100 and see what they say.
You will hear from me again in a couple of weeks.

Love to all,

Alan Lomax
