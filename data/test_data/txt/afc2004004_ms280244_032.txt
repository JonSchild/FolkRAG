11/IV
It was there Rob McCullum
Verocious and free
A bold lad defying, while poacher was he,
Me roamed the dark forest and the dear mossy glen,
And     - ?
Alone in the mountain, alonein the hill,
Along through the valley he poached at his will,
He thought not of joys but wild savage pride
The prey of his gun, and his dog by his side.

Oh one night (?) and evening, and all was dark
McCullum was summoned at the courth to appear
But now for his liberty he shurl(?) didd fear
And there with his courage he showed em with fear.

Oh its alone in the mountain, alone in the hill
Alone through the valley, he poached at his (?)
Oh it's McCullum was summonsed to a court    appear
Now for his liberty now did he fear
He visionly swore and     shot him down the heart
Before                            This day he would part.

Oh when McCullum was ummonsed to a court   appear,
He now showed them with courage , he showed em with fear,
But he visionly vowed that if constable King
Arrest him for him he would willingly swing

A warrant was granted McCullum to bring
The task to arrest him fell on Constable King
A natie bridge station was the home of his pride
And pure admiration of all this beside.
(Jimmy I think you're mixed up on this one. You've gone over
the same stanza about three times. Did you know that?) Do you
know any other poaching songs?
Its. . . I'd have liked to. . .I'd have liked to. . . Well, I'll give you
the lament then:

Farewell to the hills, the dales of Straspee,
To the dark woods at Tulloch all wailing for he will listen no more,
Nor scour the dark forests of gloomy Glen More.
Farewell to the grouse, the roe and the deer,
They now roam at their pleasure, McCummum not hear.
