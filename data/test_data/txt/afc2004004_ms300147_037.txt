Dear Alan and Shirley:
rec. your letter and the
contracts Xmas eve. Am signing and sending
you the two copies as you requested. so you 
are free to do what you can with them.

hope for both as us the songs are a sucess.
have spent the last two weeks quitely here in
my home. but am going back to Little Rock
and to work this next Monday. I am thinking
some now of changing job maybe within the 
next week or so but my address will be the
same. so any mail you send send it here
to R.3 Box 122 Hebor Springs. it will be sent on to
me at what ever address I have in LIttle Rock
this week have spent in diging among old
books and papers here have found quite a few
old Balads. I copied years ago. Many of them
I can sing much better than those you have
and some of them are older any way they are
all folk songs. will if you are entrested
in them send you a list of them. if not, will
maybe see if can do some thing with them
at the studio here in Little Rock or Memphis.

Alan will I be allowed to (over)
