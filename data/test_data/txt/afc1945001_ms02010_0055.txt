The purpose of a hate rumor is to spread hatred, to make a given
group a scapegoat. The denial of specific hate rumors does not
spike the hate which created the rumor but tends to shift the hate 
to different "facts" or different rumors. Hate rumors should never
be repeated or printed by themselves--even in order to be denied--
because this tends to keep a group in the focus of suspicion and
encourages controversy and suspicion. The enemy wants us to debate
and suspect the activities of groups other than the enemy.  The 
evidence shows clearly that many hate rumors originate in the 
United States as symptoms of domestic social and economic problems--
especially those problems which war creates or intensifies.
A list of the groups against which most current hate
rumors are directed follows, in alphabetical order:
Army administration            Labour
Business                                 Negroes
Catholics                                 Profiteers
Defense workers                   Rationing Boards
Draft boards                           Red Cross
English                                     Russia
Farmers                                   Unions
Jews

The false information carried by hate rumors is less
important than the hatred which the rumors convey.  Factual denials
appear to have had little effect in stopping hate rumors.  As one
hate rumor is exposed, it is replaced by another rumor conveying
the same hatred.  It seems clear that persons who feel certain 
hatreds will readily believe and repeat any rumor which gives expression
to that hatred.  Hate rumor obviously must be attacked at the source--by curing the cause of the hatred.
