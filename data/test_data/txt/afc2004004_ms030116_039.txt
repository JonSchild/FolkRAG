gonna move atall.  Next thing you know he's gone into the brush.
Rev. D:  You gotta run him.  So if you catch me you can have me.
Eliz:  I'll catch you.  I've caught a lot of you.
Rev. D:  Thass right.  I wadn't travellin so fast then.  I was jes takin my
time.
Johnny:  Ain't laid his ears back really yet. . . It might be that Rev. Davis,
like he says, feels like a rabbit.  An if a rabbit goes around advertisin
where he's at -- if sompin's after him -- that might not be but he feels
like sumpin's after him, see?  But a rabbit after while gits to know what
runs him an what won't run him, see?  In other words, a cow can walk
right up on a rabbit an grace all round him.  They won't move.  If a cow
comes around.  If a horse comes around.  But the minute a dog gits in the
pasture a rabbit gits up.  He don't try to outwit the dog.  In other words
he gits to know the diff'rence.
Rev. D:  He don't have to see the dog.  Jus see you.
Johnny:  That's part of the way the Almighty sees to creature.  I watched a 
little killdeer -- one of these little birds -- on there nest.  Watched
goats graze around it.  The killdeer will fight their noses when they
come right up to the nest.  But if a dog or a cat come around the killdeer
will go floppin off like it was crippled see?  It knows that it has to git
away from them.  The other animals, the grazin animals, they know all they
have to do is keep em from tramplin their thing so the nip em on their
nose. . .The sun is glorious.  I'll take these two chairs an we can sit
out doors near the creek if you want to.
Rev. D:  I was jes finishin up a story here.
Johnny:  All right.  I didn't mean to i nterrupt.
Rev. D:  You ain't doin it.
Eliz:  There's no way we could run this thing outdoors, is there?
Johnny:  I'm fraid we don't have any extension.  I used to have  a hundred foot
extension.  You know when I had my own thing.
