Leave off the hands from off my hands
And bring to me my sword
And there's no a man in a' Scotland
But I'll brave him at is word.

[The crowd joins]  But wantonly, etc ...

      O what is death but parting breath
      On many a bloody plain
      I've dared his face + in this place
      I scorn him yet again ...

Sound:  Distant horse's hooves - -

Man:     The king's manager is riding up the hill

Woman:   Look at the clock! ....

Man:        It's bewitched.  The hands are
                moving toward 12.

Sound:     Clock begins to strike 12 ... Continues below

Macpherson:  In all this crowd is there a man of
                    my clan?  Let him come forward and
                    I will give him my fiddle.  [Pause as
                    clock continues]  Is there any man in all 
                    this company who wishes James Macpherson 
                    well? [Pause]
                    Some come here to see me hang,
                    And some to hear my fiddle
                    But before it will fall to any of you
                    I'll break it through the middle!
