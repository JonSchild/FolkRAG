Mr. Olin Downes,
New York World's Fair, Inc.,
350 Fifth Avenue,
New York City.

Dear Mr. Downes:

While I think of it, here is another suggestion that you 
might find valuable and I will send it along to you, altho' 
perhaps some one else has thought of it first.

You may not agree with me that the ragtime-jazz-blues-swing 
tradition is the most important American contribution to sophisticated 
music, but at least this tradition deserves a 
great deal of attention at the World's Fair. I have encountered 
a Negro here in Washington who might fit into the World's 
Fair program very nicely and who I think could represent this 
tradition as well or better than anyone I know.

His name is Jellyroll Morton. He is well along in his fifties 
and grew up with jazz as it developed in the tenderloin district 
of New Orleans and spread up the river to Chicago. His 
brother-in-law brought the first jazz band to New York; and 
Jellyroll Morton, himself, is rated in down-beat as the most 
versatile and fertile man in the field of jazz from 1910-1929.

I am recording for the Library all of his compositions, all of 
the folk tunes that he knows along with very full bibliographical 
material. I think the musicologists of the future will 
find in it essential material for writing the history of American 
music. Jellyroll is still a great pianist and a fine 
singer and he has had wide experience in the organization of 
orchestras, in arranging and composing. He also knows personally 
everyone who has ever had anything to do with jazz or 
swing. He might be the ideal person to put in charge of the 
World's Fair Jam Session, without which, of course, the World's 
Fair would be musically incomplete.

What about "Yankee Doodle Goes to Town"?

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
In Charge of Archive of
American Folk Songs
