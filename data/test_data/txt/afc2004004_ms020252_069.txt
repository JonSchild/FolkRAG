2nd R. of 10/12/61, Song 16, p. 2

YOU BETTER MIND

Yes, you get in the field an' you don't wanna fight,
You join the Church but you won't live right,
But you gonna give an account at the Judgment,
You better mind.
(CHORUS)

Yes, you look at me with a finger of scorn
But my God see you just as sure as you're born,
An' you gonna give an account at the Judgment,
You better mind.

You can talk about me just as much as you please,
The more you talk I'm gonna bend my knees
Because you gonna give an a ccount at the Judgment,
You better mind.
(CHORUS)

Now, if you sister treat you wrong,
Take it to yourself and God alone,
'Cause you got to give an account at the Judgment,
You better mind.
