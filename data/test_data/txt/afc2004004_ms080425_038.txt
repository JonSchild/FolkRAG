AL:   What does that mean, tell us.

McGraw:   Homecoming is a reunion forfamilies, like the
McGraw family, the Wooten family, the Hambrick family.

AL:   How many of those families are here?

McGraw:   Those families             are all here, the Wallace
families, the Lambert families, the Aikens families,
they all. . it's a reunion for them, and all their kinfolks
come.  Now if you notice, after lunch, there'll be as many
people outside as there are inside.   Those outside are 
renewing acquaintance with their cousins, and their
uncles and aunts that they haven't seen in a long time.
And if you notice, around the church, there's several
places spreading dinner besides on the big table.  That's
little family get togethers, and that's what these get
togethers is all about-- all day singing with dinner on the
ground, and homecoming, and dedication day for the cemetary.
It's a happy time, a happy time, but when you see your loved
ones that you haven't seen in a long time, that's sad, that
brings tears.  Inoticed one of the cameramen, a while ago,
Phil, he was just a-crying all over, he was so happy that. . .
and he had never seen anything like this.  People are very 
emotional, and they are shaking hands and are glad to
see you.  They are really showing you their hospitality,
by getting you to come and partake of their food.
