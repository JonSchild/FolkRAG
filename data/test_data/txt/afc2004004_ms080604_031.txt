Reel  45 (no. 2044):

A.L.:
            You were talkin, Bill.

B. Gordon:
            Well, ah. . they never would come in the 
camp and rob nobody, but they always lay for ya after you'd
get out the camp.  They'd always be outside, waitin on ya.
Whenever you come out, you had to give up that money.  They'd
take that money whenever you come out cos they'd put them
guns on ya.  They don't need you talkin 'bout you ain't got
it- they'd get that money.

A.L.:
            What would they do?

B.G.:
            Take your money, make you go 'head on.

W.S. Hart:
            Yeah they used to. . they used to 
(unintelligible), cos I was in Fort Jones camp.  It was
like. . . a camp sittin there, an one sittin down there. . . 
you used to go between some stump they had shorn up, you
know-- and they'd be hidin behind that stump.  Alot of us go
down that road talkin bout we goin to another camp to meet
payday.  Before they get to that other camp, they come back,
say to them guys, "Hey, what's up?".  I wanted to kill
somebody. . and so. . Alright, I went on down, they come on
back, (tore my ankle up?), I had my big pistol and I go down
that road singin and hollerin -let em know I'm comin.  So, was
nobody sayin nothin.  So, I says, "Now, they just held up them
boys, now I'm goin down here with some others" -I got my 45
in my hand.  So, he said. . I come on back, said, "Man!  Nobody
held you up".  Said, "Oh, yes he did!". Then 'bout two or
three hours after that, somebody else is goin down that road
and say he got held up.  So, ah. . one night, I was goin round
the camp you know, lookin at the boys settin out in the camp
low(settin down their camp load?).  That road's just like. . 
looks like streets, you know?  Some of em have two or three
hundred tents in em.  Shacks. . . and ah. . so, I heard two boys
a-settin down talkin.  Kept hearin him talkin -said, "You know
that William S. Hart? -He wanna kill somebody."  Other one
says, "Why you says so?"  He says, "You know we held up them
boys the other night and he come right on down there singin
to let us know he comin.  I know he had heard that they had
got held up."  I said, "Uh-huh.  Now that's who been holdin up
these people down here."  So, I went on around, I didn't say
nothin.  So, the boys says, "You wanna kill somebody, don't
ya?".  I say, "Why you say that?".  "Everytime someone get held
up, you goin off road behind.  You want somebody?".  I said,
