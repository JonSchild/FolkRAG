Jilson Setters     1

BALLAD MAKIN' IN THE MOUNTAINS OF KENTUCKY
Jean Thomas

Nor was Jilson Setters found wanting when the question of free
silver swept the land. This ballad he sings in a more challenging
tone.

Laboring men please all attend
While I relate my history.
Money it is very scarce
Let's try and solve the mystery.
The question we will argue now
Has caused a great sensation;
It interests both old and young,
The welfare of our nation.

The farmer is the cornerstone,
Though he is cruelly treated.
Bryan is the poor man's friend
He wrongly was defeated.
You know our nation owes a debt,
'Tis true, and I will say it;
The bonds they issued call for gold,
And silver will not pay it.

We know the gold bugs hold the rein
He's resting at his leisure;
He will cut the poor man's wages down.
Oh! how it gives him pleasure.
When William Bryan was on the track,
The gold bug he objected;
They said their factories all most stop
If Bryan was elected.

Money traffic is all the go,
It fills the gold bug's pocket.
His hand is in the treasury vault,
There is no use to lock it.

You rascals in your easy chairs,
Your crime you are concealing.
We are sure to cut your salaries down,
On you it's fastly stealing.
A few more years you'll hold the reins,
Before our next great battle;
We'll arise, defend free silver's cause,
Regain our precious metal.
