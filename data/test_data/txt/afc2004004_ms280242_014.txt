O mammy, mammy," he says, and runs to the barn.
She says, "What's wrong?"
"Oh" he says, "Come and see this."
"What's wrong with you, laddie?"
"O dear, o dear. I've often heard the travelling people speak
about the berklers," he says. "I think they'll get a child here
tonight."
"Awa', laddie," she says. "Dinna be silly."
"Come and see this, then." he says.
     So she goes awa' abend and she strikes ammatch and looks into
the barrel - the great big wooden box, and she seed the women's
skirts there and socks there, and men's clothes there. All full
of blood, and this great big cudgel or stick.
"O dear, o dear," she says. "This is terrible. Is the door locked
or the window?"
"I couldna tell ye."
     So they go and try the barn doors, but the doors was all
locked.
"O dear, o dar," she says. "This is terrible. We'll get killed."
"But wait a minute, mam" he says. "Abend the back of the turnip
shed there's the place they put the cows' dung through."
(And in Scotland there's a square place from the cows' stand - 
fling the dung through outside.)
The wee laddie said, "I'll get through here. I'll pull your basket"
     So he gets outside andhe gets his mother's basket pulled
through - a heavy blanket. The old woman tried to get through,
but she couldna do it, she was too fat. She tried all the doors
in the place - couldn't get out. The wee boy was greeting (crying)
down through the night. He saw two or three big ricks of hay in
the middle of the field, and there was a cover on them, and he
makes a hole in the hay and pulls his mother's basket in below
the cover and hides. He heard the carriage going by -- the
doctors. He heard it going away from the farm into Elgin. The
four horses in the big, black coach. And - God help him - he
heard his mummy screaming, but he couldna save her, and they
killed his mummy.
