Dear Alan,

Within ten minutes of receipt of your letter I was
down at the exchange watching them pack the camera. Your check
was dated for the 22nd, although you said in your letter that
it was postdated for Friday.

At any rate, they took your check without so much as a
murmur, and since they can't bank it until tomorrow morning (it's
way past bank time now), it won't get to your Washington Bank until
Friday.

The size of the picture is not 2 1/4 X 2 1/4 as I at
first thought, but full vest pocket size, which is slightly smaller
but in better proportion. It is entirely adequate, however, I am
sure, being well over "miniature" size. You use the 127 film, &
I suggest Panatomic X. You'll get 8 pictures per roll--and the size
is so standard you'll be able to get films anywhere.

I regret that we can't get together before you leave to
help you puzzle the thing out, but I made sure they're including instructions.
Perhaps when you get back we can give the outfit a good
going over. The outfit is being sent out by Express tonight, so you
should get it Friday morning the latest.

Good luck on your trip and good shooting.

Yourn,
Al
Al Fields.
