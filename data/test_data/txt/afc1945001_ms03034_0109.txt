     point of view of the paper. The highest standards of objectivity 
     must be maintained. To use this new invention to advance 
     editorial 
     causes would debase newspaper ethics.

 11.   Rumors should not be presented in a context that would make 
      them 
      seem to be a mere joke. The public should not regard the matter 
      as a merely humorous entertainment.

 12.   Radio programs dealing with rumor should exercise the greatest 
       caution against unwittingly furthering rather than discrediting 
       rumors. Attention is called to the memorandum on this subject 
       by 
       Mr. Charles Seipmann of the Radio Division of O.W.I.

 13.   Feature stories, radio programs, etc. should be educational, not 
        of a sensational character. Rumors should not be published for 
        the sake of stimulating or satisfying morbid curiosity.

V.   Methods of Operation

      The agency must be prepared to fulfill various functions in the 
      field 
      of morale service.

1.   Many problems will be brought in that require good judgement, a 
      knowledge of community resources, and a willingness to help in 
      the morale building of the locality.

2.   The agency should be prepared to employ all or most of the 
       following methods:

       a.   Investigating Committees. Some rumors may be combatted 
             by 
             appointing a committee of investigation to determine the 
             facts. 
             Committee's report is then released along with the rumor.

         b.   Posters and Graphic Methods. Most posters depict rumor as 
               a 
               source of information for the enemy. The demoralizing 
               effect 
               of wedge-driving rumors is probably much more serious 
               and is 
               readily adaptable to graphic illustration.

           c.   Propaganda Literature. Leaflets, diagrams, booklets, etc. if 
                 well written and accurate are an effective instrument for 
                 conveying 
                 information and admonition about rumor.

            d.   Radio Programs. Two types of radio programs are effective 
                  in 
                  combatting rumors. The first of these is the "facts" 
                  programs. 
                  The basic logic of this approach is that if facts are available 
                  and complete, rumors will have no room to thrive. The 
                  second 
                  type of program deals with rumor and gossip generally. 
                  These 
                  illustrate the ridiculousness, dangers, and menace of 
                  rumor in 
                  time of war. Considerable caution, however, must be 
                  exercised 
                  to elude the possibility that rumors may actually be spread 
                  by 
                  broadcasting them over the radio.
