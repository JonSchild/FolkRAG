"Hudie Ledbetter was the son of Wess and Sallie Ledbetter.
Both of them are now dead. They were poor people. They worked
hard to make an honest living. They had a standard record 
throughout Harrison county and Louisiana as being honest and
respectable people. They lived for their son, prayed night
and day for him to be what he is today."*
