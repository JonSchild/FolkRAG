TOILERS OF THE NATIONS
Words by John Gleese, D. D.
(Melody: Onward, Christian Soldiers)

Toilers of the nations,                   Toil we now no longer
Thinkers of the time,                     For anothers gain,
Should the note of battle,            While our wives and chidlren
Loud thro' every clime,                 Pine in want and pain.
March ye 'gainst the tyrants,       Grieve we now no longer
Heedless of their steel,                 At another's good,
Be a band of brother,                    Let us all be brothers,
Speed the common weal.             Let us all have food.

CHORUS Onward, friends of freedom,
Onward for the strife!
Each for all we struggle,
One in death and life.

Seamstress in the hovel,              Come, then, worn and weary,
Women of the mill,                        Come, then, stout and brave
Low indeed ye grovel,                    Join this noble army,
Tame ye are, and still                    Sworn our land to save
Come ye like the Valkyries,           From the power of tyrants,
Beauteous in your might,             From the curse of greed;
Sing ye songs of valour,                Down with the destroyer,
Nerve us for the fight.                   Crush the serpent's seed.

WE ASK FOR NOTHING MORE
(Melody: Auld Lang Syne)

The say we are so ignorant,                   Pull down the wretched cottages
We don't know right from wrong;         That breed all kinds of sin,
But we can tell them what we want,     So fair and picturesque without,
And what we'll have ere long!                But fever dens within;
Our programme's very simple:              Build houses fit for workers
Give justice to the poor!                          Sound roof, and wall, and floor;
We'll be content with nothing less,       We'll be content with nothing less,
We ask for nothing more                        We ask for nothing more
