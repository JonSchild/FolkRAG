     Tell me about that.                . . . remember it?
     Well, since we grew up together it's hard to remember our first date,
but I remember I was crazy about him, and I wasn't too sure about it either,
at first. He was a good catch, . . .           in the community. We've been

     So you were lookin' for him to notice you in a way?
