in the perfection way. The melodies were all mine, but
I believed he could do much better with it than I could
because he made a lot of corrections that probably would 
have gone maybe haywire, and of course I've kept the tune
ever since. It is one of my first tunes.

As I before said, maybe you may be able to notice
the Spanish tinge, but you must have a powerful background. 
For an instance, those days they used "La Paloma" -- was one
of the great Spanish tunes.

You know, New Orleans was inhabited with maybe every
race on the face of the globe, and, of course, we had Spanish
people there, plenty of them, and plenty French people. Of
course, I may demonstrate a little bit of "La Paloma" to
show you that the tinge is really in there. (Piano) That 
would be the common time, which it gives you the same thing
in there. (Piano) I hope this is quite clear to you, only
one is a blues, there differentiating in these things, [it] comes
from the right hand. You play the left hand just the same,
but of course, blues -- you got the syncopation in there. It
gives it an entirely different color, that really changes the 
color from red to blue. Maybe you can notice this powerful
bass hand.
