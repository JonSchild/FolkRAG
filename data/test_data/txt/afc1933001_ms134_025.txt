The cost of the trip I should estimate as follows:-
                 60 days at $5.00 per day  $300.00
              7000 miles at $ .05 per mile 350.00
 300 12" acetate discs at $ .75 each  225.00
Repairs and parts for the recorder
                                                (approx.)  40.00
   Miscellaneous expenses (approx.)  50.00
                                                TOTAL  $965.00
