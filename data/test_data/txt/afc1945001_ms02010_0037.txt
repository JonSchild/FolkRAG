established information centers. Materials to supply the information
needed to cover local rumors can usually found locally.
If the rumor-control group wishes to concern itself with
non-local rumors, it can summarize such rumors and report them to
the Bureau of Intelligence of the Office of War Information, which
will try to supply necessary information materials to deal with the
rumors. Sometimes this material will already have been prepared
but not widely enough distributed; or an analysis of rumors from
rumor-control groups may show the need for giving the facts wider
distribution.

Non-local rumors, for most efficient handling by the
Bureau of Intelligence of the Office of War Information, can be
divided as follows:

1. Productions: raw materials, agriculture, finished
products, general progress.
2. Transportation
3. Manpower: labor, management
4. Economic problems
5. Price control
6. Wage stabilization 
7. Rationing, conservation, and salvage
8. War bonds, taxation, inflation
9. Military matters
10. Selective Service
11.  Consumer problems
12. Health and welfare
