Mr Alan Lomax
Columbia Univ,
New York,

Dear Alan.
Rcd your letter yesterday, always glad 
to hear from you. glad you are getting 
the Mess [sta] straightened out, the thing 
that burdened me worst, was the fact,
that this groupe used my Song 
(Tribulations.) & labeled it Traditional. 
They titled it (Trials Trouble Tribulations)
The Folks we Record for now told me 
about it. I don't think they believe I 
wrote it but you & I Know I did,
Hill & Range compared My Record & 
theirs, they was the same. That's all I 
could get from them. they also wanted a 
copy of your & My Contract they made 
a copy & returned it to me and told me 
I would have to look to you for my Share 
of Royalties. Anyway Thanks for all 
you have & are doing for Me.

Your friend
E, C, Ball

PS I rec, two or three Royaltie checks from Progressive Music 
soon after the record come out. None since
