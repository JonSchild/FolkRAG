a batch of our stuff. I should
have demanded this favor at
the time.

Col Bill Splan of Missoula, Montana,
is President and Founder of the International
Cowboys Association. I think he
would be interested in having the
names of his members in the Library
of Congress. Your are the one to
write him.

I wrote you a letter yesterday 
which I didn't mean to
send. Tear it up if someone else
mailed it. The last I heard of
Cleon Ruck he [was] had been sentenced
to the Insane Asylum in order not
to hang him for raping through a
long single night two underage Negro girls he had
seduced into his home in Taylor. "Run 
Nigger Run" has been in the public domain
for 100 years or more. J.A.L.

I'll send your letter on to a friend
in Taylor.
