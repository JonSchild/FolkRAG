Good bye to the world, I know I'm gone,
Good bye to the world because I know I'm gone,
And I'll be gone a long, long , long.

I hope heaven will be my home,
I hope heaven will be my home,,
No more on this earth for me to roam.

Sinner, sinner, sinner, sinner, won't you pray for me,
Sinner, sinner, won't you pray for me, 
Pray for me to let the devil let me be.

When I'm dead and dead way down in my grave,
When I'm dead, dead way down in my grave,
No more good peter of that man I will crave.

I won't be buried like all my family was,
I won't be buried like all my family was,
I won't be buried like my family was.

They will put me in a box in the prison yard,
They will put me in a box in the prison yard
Not even a tomb-stone or not even a card. 

There won't be nobody following, following behind myself,
There won't be nobody following, it will be me by myself,
They'll lower me in the ground, I won't be on a shelf.

If you get out of here, try to be a good girl,
(Oh, I had to tell 'em)
Girls, if you get out of here, try to be a good girl,
That is the only way you gonna wear diamonds and pearls.
