1. I have heard that the Negro soldiers in
Mississippi have to tear their stripes
of their uniforms whenever they
go into town, or they get torn off.
2. Right after Hitler's 10th Anniversary
There was as a small boy up on
the square trying to sell his
papers and business wasnt so
go so he began shouting "Read all
about it Hitler died---------his
mustache" saying mustache to himself.
Not hearing the lad say mustache every
one rushed to buy his papers
3 Mussolini ask Hitler for Italy back
and Hitler tells him "That's a old
debt and I don't pay old debts back and
don't pay no new till they get old.
