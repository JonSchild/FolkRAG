Students' Reactions To the War (Continued) –2–

The majority of the students did not mention ideological concepts
of the meaning of the war, but for the most part were concerned with personal
problems and deprivations.

Those in the lowest economic groups were more favorably disposed
toward our war effort and were less critical of the conduct of the war than
the youth of families of higher economic levels. The younger of these
youth were more verbal and less critical than the older. Fully 20 per cent
of the youth were concerned with the possibility of a depression after the
war and a larger number were concerned more with the personal deprivations
than with the issues of the war. A large number of youth stated that they
were confused by the issues because of the many contradictions they observed
in the newspapers and over the radio and because they were more confused
than clarified by the discussions of their parents.
