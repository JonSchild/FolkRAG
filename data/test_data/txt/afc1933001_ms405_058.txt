ADVENTURES
BLOOMINGTON AND LOS ANGELES

My heart was in my mouth, for I couldn't yet believe that all this
terrific power, these tons of wood and iron and steel, would pause
for insignificant me. Suddenly came the shriek of tightened brakes,
the long train ground to a stop. I hurried for the first opening. From
it swung two men clad in uniform. "Shine his eyes with your lantern",
said the deep-voiced conductor, "I want to see the color of his hair,
the cut of the jib of the son-of-a-gun who had influence enough to stop
a train that can't be stopped." Then as he caught sight of my timid,
inoffensive exterior, he gave me a half-friendly push: "Hurry up, son;
get aboard. I thought you'd look like a combined Jesse James and Sam
Bass, rolled into one invincible devil. You don't even resemble a
millionaire!"
