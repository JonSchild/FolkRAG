Jack and his mother they was sittin' hard, and there come a big
storm and the northwest wind blowin' thru the cracks in the house.
Jack, he just got plum aggravated with it, and told his mother
one day, he's gonna go off to stop the northwest wind from blowin.
She said "How in the dickens you gonna do that?"  He said "I'm 
gonna plug it up with my hat!"  And he started out, he chopped her
out a big bunch of wood, and Will Tom (?) had broke the hammer,
and he didn't have nobody to fix the cracks.  . .and broke the hammer
and used all the wood up to fix the fence and broke the hammer
crackin' walnuts, and he didn't know no other way but to go stop
it.  He chopped her up a big pile of wood and started out.  He
got down the road a piece and seed an old man standin' by the
road. He walked up to him and the old man said "Hallo there, son,
how you doin'?"  He said "I a'int doin' too good,"  He said,
"Where you goin'" he said "I'm goin' to stop the northwest wind"
