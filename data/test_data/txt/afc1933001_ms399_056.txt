"Lord, make us able
To eat all on the table.["]
Eat up every? damn thing
Must look sorta stable

In Texas, the Reverend Able Mulkey was known for many years as
the favorite cowboy preacher. During the years that he visited the 
big ranches and conducted revival meetings, "The Cowboy's Dream" and 
"The Cowboy's At Church" because popular as the songs sung while he 
was urging the cowboys to turn away from ways of wickedness.

Soon the cowboys adopted both songs are range songs. They added 
new stanzas and changed those already known by putting in expressions 
that had grown out of ranch life.

"The Cowboy At Church" includes many phrases used in ranch life 
by cowboys-a short, fitting sermon, very much like the sermons preached 
by earnest circuit riders in the pioneer days.

The Cowboy at Church

Some time ago-two weeks or more
If I remember well-
I found myself in town and thought
I'd knock around a spell.
When all at once I heard the bell-
I didn't know 'twas Sunday-
For on the plains we scarcely know
A Sunday from a Monday.

A-calling all the people
From the highways and the hedges
And all the reckless throng
That tread ruin's ragged edges,
To come and hear the preacher tell
Salvation's touching story,
And how the new road misses hell
And leads you straight to glory.

I started by the chapel door,
But something urged me in,
And told me not to spend the day
In revelry and sin.
I don't go much on sentiment,
But tears came to my eyes,
It seemed just like my mother's voice
Was speaking from the skies.
