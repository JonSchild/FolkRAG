Tape:  Sacred Harp-- exteriors     24


first song in the Sacred Harp book- it's 335, Return Again.  
I was just a small girl and the first singing school I 
went to was at Alexander City, Alabama and Mr. Culla 
over there in Alexander City taught the first singing 
school I ever went to and then Mr. Lee Mann, I went to 
singing school under himabout 10 years later and then 
the rest of it I either sung by heart or caught on to it 
during class.  It's something that has has to grow on you, 
and its really, I don't think, for entertainment.  It's 
for enjoyment, you have to get in there and really enjoy it.
  
Mrs. Stimson:    You have to sing it to enjoy it, and I went 
to singing school to Uncle Tom Denson, over close to 
Carrolton, and there was a big family of us and we 
all sung.  That's what we did, you know, all go to 
singings.  Really enjoyed it.

Mr. Jones:    I told a fellow four years ago I was going to 
the United Convention and he said "How many days you going" 
and I said two and he said "I sure would hate to listen to 
2 whole days of singing" and I said I would too.  I'd 
be ashamed if I couldn't sing.

Mrs. J:    it's something to be thankful for that you can
really do that.

Mr. J:    I think it's an honor to be able to do that, good 
spiritual song.
