I, don' know, I was somewhere near twenty.  'Cause I done been to St.
Simon an' back an' all.  An' ah, but ah, but anyway, I,
I jus', ah, slipped off an' left.  Slipped off while they goin' to
the big meetin'.  I'm goin' over.  I went ta Osierfield ta,
ta Miss Lula Brown an' them house.
AL:  What?
BJ:  I went to Osierfield to Miss Lula Brown an' them house.
Jus' slipped off an' left.  An' Lula, Miss Lula tried to git me
to go back, but I want, didn' want to go back.  See?
AL:  Did you pack your. . .
BJ:  No, I didn't pack or nothin'.  I jus' carried a few things.
An' so, an' then, then I made up my mind then, when I
go back at my things, I'll slip an' git 'em.  An' I did. . .I didn'
git.
AL:  While they were at work, huh?
BJ:  Huh?. . .Yeah, that's right.  I seen 'im workin', too.  An' I slipped
in there an' got me a few mo' things.  So I jus' never did go back.
He came for me but I tol' him I didn' wanna go back. . .He came for
me twice. See?  The second time he came, I had done sent Rosalie
to Mama. . .See?  So I just didn' wanna go back.  But he told some
of 'em that, if I stay around there, that I was gonna
come back; I was jus', jus' didn't, that I just didn't know what I was
doin'.  That's what he told a lot a people.  Mr. Willbanks, he
tol' me the same thing, the white man.  He say, "You, you'll come
back."  Said, "You jus' young an' don't an' don't know whatcha doin'."  I
never go back, dere.  Tha's all.
