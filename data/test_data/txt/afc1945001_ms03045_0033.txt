Gentlemen:

The following are the rumors which we were able to 
collect in our department during the past week:

"That the Army is going to take over Cleveland's Lake Shore 
Hotel for a training station."   Cleveland,   August 10, 1942. [*1*]

"That the War Department often fails to notify the next of kin 
upon a soldier's safe arrival."   Cleveland,   August 10, 1942. [*1*]

Another version of the above: "The cards which soldiers fill out 
to be mailed by the War Department upon 'safe arrival' are often 
misplaced, lost, or are never sent out."  Cleveland,   Aug. 10, 1942. [*1*]

"Another typical English blunder - the handling of the India 
situation."   Cleveland,   August 10, 1942 [*2*]

"That Jews are being shown favoritism by draft boards and given 
exemptions without sufficient reason."   Cleveland,   August 12, 1942. [*6*]

"Did you know that they have secret anti-aircraft defenses along 
Cleveland's lake front."   Cleveland,   August 13, 1942. [*3*]

"That there is great inequality among draft boards  -  some are given 
exemptions while others in the same predicament are forced to go." 
Cleveland,    August 13, 1942.

"The 'big shots' in Washington know how long this war is going to 
last - we're just suckers."   Cleveland,   August 14, 1942. [*3*]

"Why shouldn't I get tires when I take care of them. Young fellows 
working in defense plants are tearing around and wearing off their 
tires carelessly and they are given opportunity to get tires." 
Cleveland,   August 14, 1942.
