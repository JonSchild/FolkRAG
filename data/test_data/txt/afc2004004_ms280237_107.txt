Cox: Yeah, that was a sort of a runnin' fight like the rest - 
like the old (mumble) days.
Lomax: The English and the French used to do a lot of fighting,
didn't they?
Cox: Oh, fight, yes they was always fighting, hand over fist.
That's all you - all you heard about then.
Lomax: Do you know any Frenchmen Harry?
Cox: No, I don't know nothin'. . .much about them. There's a - some
French women, some of them come over here and got married. I
had a cousin. His wife's French.
Lomax: What do you think of the French yourself?
Cox: Mn. I don' know. I can't say much about them. I think they
are all alike. I think they are, er, - look after
their own selves first. So do everybody. (laughs) That's what you
want to do, always want to look after yourself. That's like the
eleventh commandment, you know. There's ten commandments;
there's the eleventh. "Steal rather than starve," that's the
eleventh. "Steal rather than starve." "Steal, rather than starve."
(laughs) That's the eleventh commandment.
Kennedy: That's the eleventh commandment, in England - in Norfolk?
(Cox laughs) (cut)
Cox:
There was an old miller in Befordshire,
He had three sons as you shall hear,
As he was a-goin' to make his will
To see which son should have the mill.
And as he was goin' to make his will
To see which son should have the mill.
