Mr.R: Good...good...I want you to get a shot of ... this baby
puts her hands in her ears! (laughter)
OK...you all be first back there, and youall be second.

[*++*]
All sing: "Bells are ringing what's the matter?..." (round)
(and again, 4 times)

Mr.r: Good! ... This is the companion key from F major to
F Minor. You noticed in F major we had one flat, and
this was your key note, which is fa. In this one we
got four flats, and it's in the key of F minor. Your
half steps occur between 2 and 3, and 5 and 6 on this
one; on the other one (F major) it's 3 and 4, and 7 and 8.
OK, let's try this one...

All sing: "La mi fa (F G A-flat), fa mi la..."

Mr.R: I want the girls to follow this one, boys (unintelligible)
Girls...I want the girls to follow the white stick and 
the girls to follow the black stick.

All sing: (girls and boys sing) (the minor exercise in canon)

[*++*]
[Mr. R] HM: That teaches you: when one says a fa, and somebody says
a sol, don't let it bother you. Just call the note
whatever it is and sing your part. Allright, we're
going to let the boys go first. (They sing)
That's sounds like you need a little more practice.
This is where you get to learn your tonality. It's just
like climbing a ladder, you go up a little, one step at
a time 'til you get to the top, then you come down one
step at a time -- you get a little lower, a little lower,
and then lower. You got to learn to take your voice and
jump around on the scale to the different sound. Then
you'll get to recognize the la, you'll automatically know
