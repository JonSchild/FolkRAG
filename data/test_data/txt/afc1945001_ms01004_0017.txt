Dear Mr. Horowitz:
Since Mr. Cisin has been taken into the Army, Mr. Wilson has
asked me to send you the information we have collected on
"rumors".
I am enclosing copies of (1) the letter sent to our interviewers
and the accompanying sheet of instructions, (2) the 
follow-up letter to ask them to continue the rumor-collection
for a second week, (3) a rough classification we have made
 of the rumors gathered, (4) a list of the areas covered in
our part of the study, (4) the cards on which the rumors were
sent to us by the interviewers.
All of the reports have not yet reached our office.  As soon
as they come in, we shall send them right on to you.
If there is any further information you wish concerning our
methodology or any aspect of our part of the study, I hope
you will write.
Very truly yours
Jean Elvins
