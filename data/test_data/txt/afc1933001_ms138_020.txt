Mr. Harold Spivacke       -2-          October 5, 1938
We have further tentative plans prepared for a similar
series next year on cowboy ballads.  We feel sure that in this 
way our listeners  in Britain will get a far truer picture of the 
real life of this country than they can through other methods. 
I believe these special series of programs will do much to 
interpret the authentic and native life of America to the British
people. 
Yours very sincerely,  
Felix Greene
