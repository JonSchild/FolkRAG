3) So3Johnny went on down through the green wood
Till he came to a  castle of fame, fame, fame.
He spied a maiden, stood at the gate
Crying, "Fair maid do you want any brooms?"

4) This lady being up in her window so high
She spied this young man so terribly near, right neat,
She sent to her maid, "Go down to the gate
And call in the young man with his brooms."

5) So Johnny went into this castle so brave,
And entered the lady's room, gay room,
She gave him a chair and bad him sit down
Saying, "You're welcome, young man, with your brooms."

6) They sent for the priest, and married they were,
All in this lady's room, gay room,
So boys, we will drink, or what do you think,
For there's nothing like cutting down brooms."

The Golden-Haired Lad: Mickey Cronin.   Music
1) As I went out walking one morning in spring
To hear the birds whistle and the nightingale sing,
I spied a comely damsel sitting under a tree,
And she lamenting her golden-haired lad.

2) I stepped up to this fair one and bade her good-day,
Saying, "Come tell me, young maid, come tell me I pray.
O dry up those tears, love, which in torrents do flow,
For the cause of your ailment I'd much like to know."

3) "O young man, don't tease me, but go on your way,
For I am in trouble for many-a day.
For I once loved a young man from the town of Tralee,
And I called him my golden-haired lad.

4) O this young man was handsome and mild to be sure,
His lips they were fed and his heart it was pure.
I would give all the riches in High Germany
For one kiss from my golden-haired lad.

5) "O Molly, lovely Molly, you're no stranger to me,
Don't you think on that night that we drove from Tralee?
Go get yourself ready, and married we'll be,
For I am your golden-haired lad.

6) O this couple got married I hear people say,
And off the Killarney they drove the next day,
And now they are living quite conveneint to me,
And I hope there'll be bliss, with a large family.
