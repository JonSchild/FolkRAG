Mr. Mencken on Literature and Politics 
An Interview in Which He Makes Some Caustic Remarks About Writing in the Thirties 

By ROBERT VAN GELDER 

Russia and Roosevelt are 
responsible for a ten-year 
decline in the quality of 
American writing, said H.
L. Mencken. 
" The writers fell for the cur-
rent blah, and no good are can 
come from men who believe in the 
blah of their times. The writers 
of the Thirties have been en-
slaved by the bushwah of the 
Pinks." 
It was a typical Mencken interview. 
" Print it!" Mr. Mencken 
would say after delivering himself 
of what appeared on the surface 
to be the grossest libel. " I've
known so-and-so for years and in 
my considered opinion he is a 
jackass and a simple-minded 
stooge." 
The setting was the comfortably 
furnished board room and 
library of the Knopf offices on 
Madison Avenue, where Mr. 
Mencken had spent a part of the 
morning writing autograph cards
for insertion into copies of his 
new book, " Happy Days: 1880-
1892." 
" Imbecile, boob, idiot, " said Mr. 
Mencken, talking of politics and 
Pinks. He has a way of pressing 
his cigar against an ashtray and 
pushing it around when he is emphasizing 
his opinion of the editors 
of The New Republic or The 
Nations, or when he is talking of 
members of President Roose-
velt's Cabinet. Naturally, the 
cigar frequently goes out. The 
wonder is that it remains lighted 
as well as it does. 
He credits the World War and 
the peace that followed it with 
the rise of literature during the

incomparable, wonderful, great. 
As George Nathan said of " The 
Merry Widow': ' Nobody write it 
--God wrot it' You can say that 
same thing, truthfully , about 
" Babbitt" Babbitt at that time 
was the greatest man in the 
country , he was America. And
Lewis saw him truly and fully, 
had a little fun with him, too. 
   " Then he wrote ' Elmer Gantry.' 
We had prohibition and Elmer 
was the great man behind 
prohibition. Some people said he

know who speaks well of other 
novelists? None of 'em do - none
of 'em. That's proof of Red's humility.
He always speaks well of
other novelists. And probably because
of that basic humility of 
his he was caught up in politics.
He lambasted the fascists and 
then turned around and tried to
lambast the Communists in the
worst novel ever written in America.
That was - let's see, yes,
'The Prodigal Parents.' Frightful
stuff. Imbecilic."

cave of brotherhood, a staff and
diaper of belief.
   "The kids came our of college 
with degrees that weren't worth
anything. They couldn't cash in,
they couldn't get jobs, they
hadn't anything to sell. So they
turned to Messiahs - to Russia 
and to Roosevelt.

more wonderful than it ever had 
been before. They believed that
the Russians had found a system 
of government that would {{??}}
