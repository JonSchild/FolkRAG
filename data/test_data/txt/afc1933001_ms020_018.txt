JOHN A. LOMAX . ROUTE 4 BOX 341 FOREST HILLS . DALLAS TEXAS

accustomed to sing the ballads, - untrained singers - the words and the music. To this work requires field parties and the money to send them out. With the material correctly recorded and locked in vaults there will be no lack of people and means to make it available to the public. Skillful and enthusiastic collectors, willing to face inevitable hardships, are rarer. What I hope to help you bring about is the assembling of the master records [?], words and music, of all current American folk songs in the Library of Congress.

Sincerely yours,

John A. Lomax -
