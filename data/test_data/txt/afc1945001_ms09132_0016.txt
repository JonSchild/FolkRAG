Soph. -N. -F.

1. Most Negro girls don't want their boyfriends to
be sent to the South when they are drafted into
the army because of segregation.
2. I have heard a number of people (white and
negro) complain about too many war movies.
3. I was on a bus sitting in front of a lady
who told this story. There were two ladies
talking and laughing  one said she was
glad there was a war because she was making 
a lot of money. After she said that  a man
got up and slapped her.
