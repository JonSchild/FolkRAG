margin of 20 to 18. If the 
vote in his own faction of the 
government was that close he 
knew the decrees would have no 
chance at all in the still 
predominantly liberal Parlia-
ment. So he has refused to 
call the Parliament. 

Progressive Taxation 
In Reverse 

Under the Daladier decrees 
the direct income tax for the 
poor man earning annually: 

$468    tax is doubled 
$390    tax is quadrupled 
$312    tax is sextupled 

for the rich man earning an-
nually : 

$13,000   
                                                   tax is cut 
                                                   15 per cent 
$130,000                                   tax is cut 
                                                    10 per cent 
                                                ( $10,400 Less ) 

Before the decrees a worker 
earning $520 a year paid a tax 
of $7.20 . The rich industrial-
ist with a net income of $52,000 
annually, paid a tax of 
$26,956.00 

After the decrees the same 
worker will pay $27.60 ,  or 
$20.40 more. The same indus-
trialist will pay $21,632 or 
$5,324 less . 

The organized population 
of one of Europe's largest and 
most progressive democracies 
is at long last trying to rid 
itself of its increasingly 
fascist administration, yet we 
occasionally hear friends who 
rabidly oppose fascism in Ger-
many and Italy , quite as in-
temperately praise Daladier's 
attempt to squelch the strike 
against fascism, by using the 
armed forces of the nation. 


But is this Fascism ? 

Maybe we are " flogging 
Chimeras. " Maybe there is no 
threat of fascism in liberal 
France, France the mortal en-
emy of fascism in Germany. 

 Fascism Defined 

 Fascism is not merely Ital
ianism, or Germanism, it is 
the expedient of the Captains 
of industry in any country in 
which the nation's economy is 
rapidly contracting. It may 
be defined as : " A government 
which by military force at-
tempts to solve the economic 
crisis at the expense of the 
classes least able to bear the 
financial burden. " 

If this definition is val-
id are we not justified in as-
serting that Daladier's army--
backed decrees inverting the 
tax structure constitute an 
" overture to fascism? "   And 
must we not take hope from the 
fact that again in 1938, as be-
fore in 1934, the people of 
France have been sufficiently 
awake to stop the inroad of 
fascism by the General Strike 
-- stop it while there is still 
time? 

The completely censured 
press reports from France to 
the contrary notwithstanding, 
the General Strike did not 
fail. It succeeded in doing 
everything it set out to do. 
Two million workers went on
strike to represent the na-
tion's protest, despite the 
army. And Daladier is call-
ing that Parliament to recon-
sider the decrees on December 
the eighth. 

 Fascism can be stopped but 
not without concerted action 
on a national scale.
