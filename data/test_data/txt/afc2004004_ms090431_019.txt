Fisk, 7. 3. HAFFER.

These days, etc.

We here in America,
The land which God hath blessed,
Live in peace and contentment
From the East unto the West.
But realizing the danger
Which we are up against,
That's whybillions of dollars was spent
For the National Defense.

These days, etc.

Hitler was mean and hateful,
Violated international law;
That's why we are gvigg to England
Everything short of war.

It's a ruthless cold-blooded murder
And that in first degree.
He's conquered most of the European lands;
Now he wants to rule the sea.

These days, etc.

Like Satan he walks about
Seeking whom he can devour,
Do in the mouth of the lion,
And the jackal give to him his power.

He's a military strategist
Full of every trick
And the number of his names
Is six hundred and sixty-six.

These days, etc.

Our ships that sailed the ocean
Bringing goods for you and me
Were all forbidden by Hitler
To sail the seven seas.

He told us in substance,
"You keep your ships at home;
They'll certain,ly be destroyed
If they enter the war zone."

These days, etc.

O,,r government were patient
And tried to be good,
Tolerated that foolishness
Long as it possibly could.

But one day Congress
Reclaimed that freedom of the [ocean]seas,
