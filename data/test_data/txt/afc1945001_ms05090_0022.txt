"A civilian was in my office this morning and looked at the headline
that we could lose the war.  He said, 'I rather doubt that.  I can't see any
particular reason to be excited about the war.'  There is a lot of that disposition
running through the minds of the people.  The thing is getting so
serious that I think we are going to have to do something."
