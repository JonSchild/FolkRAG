Lomax: They were afraid of ghosts?
Cox: Yeah. They were afraid of seein' things about there. He
reckoned he shot many a hare in there. He - I don't believe he was
afraid of anything. There y' are. He didn't care, neither night nor
day. There was nothin' that frightened him.
Lomax: And he was nice to his family, wasn't he?
Cox: Oh yes, he was all right. (pause) Yes. We were all right
there, crawlin' about. He never done nothin' to us.
Lomax: How many of there were you?
Cox: Thirteen in his family; nine lived. Nine lived out of
thirteen. He was one out o' thirteen hisself. He come out o'
thirteen. And he had thirteen children of his own.
Lomax: And did you live pretty well when you were a little boy,
or. . ..
Cox: Well. . .
Lomax: Or was it pretty thin?
Cox: Hard. . .rough.
Lomax: What'd you eat?
Cox: Swede turnips sometimes. Had to get what you could. (pause)
I ha' been hungry. Well, he never got only ten shillings a 
week. That was as far as a labourer's money. That's all he got. You
got just what you could get. An' I'm like my uncle, I've seen more
dinnertimes than I have dinners. That's what he used to tell us. So
I. . . .(laughs) Yes. Nothin' to wear; nothin' to wear hardly. Went
about just anyhow.
Lomax: And what kind of a house did you have? Same house as you
live in up there now?
