ADVENTURES 
BLOOMINGTON AND LOS ANGELES 

Francisco to Los Angeles without one pause to take on passengers at 
any station. 
When I listened to this ominous announcement, my serene confi- 
dence in the good fortune that had heretofore rescued me from other 
over-hanging disasters was in no whit disturbed. "I'll just run down 
to Stanford and ask the President to stop that train. He'll know how. 
A railroad man founded Stanford." 
But President Wilbur could do nothing. "That through train won't 
stop for any one. In the past I have tried repeatedly for many promi- 
ment people." (He looked me over casually and concluded, I suppose, 
that I was not worth an additional effort.) "My trustees are supposed 
to exercise power and influence in California. Palo Alto and Stanford 
should be important to the life of the Southern Pacific Railroad, but 
all of us together, trustees, faculty and students, can't stop that 
train. It can't be done. You'll have to break one of your engagements"; 
and his big fist thumped for emphasis the desk in front of him. 
I assured him that I would first stand by dear old Stanford, as 
I vanished into the gathering darkness with my vaunted confidence in 
my good fortune not shattered but slipped slightly - ever so slightly. 
On the train back to San Francisco I took serious thought with 
myself. Again a fat fee, though dangling four hundred miles away, was 
in dire jeopardy. I abhorred the telegraphic device: "Imperative busi- 
ness calls me back to Texas. Leaving immediately for San Antonio. Re- 
gretting, etc". 
"No, there must be some way", I thought.
