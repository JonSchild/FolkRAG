Sam Bass

The opening stanza of the ballad of Sam Bass,as first  sung by Texas cowboys,-
authorship unknown,- includes many of the material facts of the life of this famous outlaw:

Sam Bass was born in Indiana, it was his native home,
And at the age of seventeen young Sam began to roam.
Sam first came out to Texas a cowboy for to be,-
A kinder-hearted fellow you seldom ever see.

He left Indiana at the age of seventeen, in 1860, in search of adventure as a Texas cowboy.
Like Robin Hood and many another highwayman and freebooter, he was "kind-hearted", according 
to popular tradition. He took away from tye rich and gave to the poor as Sam's persona;
inclinations dictated. Truly at all times, Sam was the "master of his fate, the captain of
his soul." His home was in teh brush; society had no claim on him. He distributed the
wealth that he collected at the point of his pistol just as his fancy directed. In the
distribution of wealth, so that every man man will be a king, there must be a he-king, a
brain-truster of what not, whose word is final. For several years Sam reigned supreme in
North Texas as he threw about the twenty dollar gold pieces that were his share when he
and Frank and Jesse James and the Younger boys staged the famous Union Pacific robbery.
He would hand the lonely farmhouse lady a twenty-dollar gold coin, refusing any change,
for a hastily prepared meal of fried chicken, hot biscuits and buttermilk. When hardpressed
by pursuing Texas Rangers, hw would pay a farmer two hundred dollars for a horse which the
farmer valued at half that sum. What wonder that the common people loved him and covered
his tracks as he rode for years over Texas, robbing banks and holding up trains as his needs
required. In the eighties there were no telephones or radios or even telegraph lines to
help locate him.

Young, handsome, free-hearted, a matchless rider, he and his band of wild, hot-blooded
young adventurers, sided and protected by an admiring populace, rode and robbed almost at
will in most thickly settled sections of Texas.

But finally, ina n attempted bank robbery at Round Rock, Texas, twenty miles north
of Austin, the Capitol City, through the treachery of one of his companions, on July 21,
1887, he"met his fate." In a fight with a company of Texas Rangers Sam was mortally wounded,
