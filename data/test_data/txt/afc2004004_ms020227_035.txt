TL: What did you do it for?
BJ: I jus' wanted to, tha's all. Tho's...That fastin' an' prayin' is really
good. You know, it, it, he'ps you a whole lot. Better to for ya,
ya can't do nothin'. [You know,] You ain't got -- You know, you
eat too much. Anyway, when you wanna fast an' pray, you can if
you want to. An' then, another thing about it, if it's your desire,
then that's the way you wanna do, God '[wi]ll bless ya. 'Cause
He said these things...Was askin' one of the disciples -- Some of
the disciples was talkin' of fastin' about diffrunt things. The, what
how the other was (thrashin' out bills ?); how the other'n was
doin' -- Duffrunt things, blessin's the other was doin'. An'
He tol' 'em, said, "These things come through by fastin' an'
prayin'." See? You git your strength.
Jesus fast 40 days, ya know. We got some people now that's
tryin' to, 40 days. They eat once a day, but I don't -- I still
ya have -- Ya not fastin', 'cause I [could] can go a long ways eatin'
once a day. I can go a long way an' take one meal a day. I'm
tellin' ya.
I had a habit of that one time, just one meal a day. You know,
fallin' off down, down to where I is now. But I'm not set
to reducin'; [I'm] but I's workin' hard; I just ha' so many things on my
mind. I just go on; just work on; that's all. Leave one place
an' go on (to) another. Well, I drink water if I want it.
