Lomax - 2

collection of mountain artifacts could no doubt take
you back to some of the more remote coves to your advantage.
There is a teacher at Townsend, Tennessee who made a study of
language forms for the Southern Folk Lore Society meeting a couple
of years ago. Townsend is at the foot of the Smokies and has been affected
by the tourist flow; all of these places have been influenced
in the extensive logging operations of the last three decades.
There is Wear's Cove on the edge of the Park and between main
roads. Cades Cove would have been a rich place before the advent of
the Park.

     My first reaction to your letter was to suggest that
you go to Dandridge, Tenn. which I have encircled on the inclosed
map*. It is rich in history, as is Jonesboro, the oldest
town in the state. Both are chrming and both have been relatively
stable in their populations. You could drive thru those towns
on the way to Knoxville and perhaps size them up for yourself.
My brother-in-law who has been with the T.V.A. for seven years
doing scenic and recreational studies, and who like myself was
one of Benton MacKaye's groups, also suggests Dandridge. It liked
its life well enough to pass a resolution asking the Authority
to build no dam which would disturb it. This is reminiscent of the
Vermonters and the Green Mountain Parkway (proposed). Dandridge
is on a minor highway, but has had a little contact with the
Authority's program in soil conservation work. In Jonesboro, Mr.
Paul Fink, who is an amateur historian might give you some leads.
Also Dr. Tom Pritchett, who spends about half his time there and
the rest in Knoxville. In Dandridge, I suggest that you talk to 
a young lawyer by the name of Paul Goddard.

     As you can see, I am mostly just thinking out loud
for you. It may be that my ideas may crystallize before you reach
here. My office phone is 2-2064 and I shall be in the office until
noon on Saturday. My home is 3730 N. Broadway. I can be
reached over my father's phone next door (6-1224). I shall probably
be unavailable on Sunday, the 27th. My office is in the New
Post Office building, downtown. I can talk with you most any 
time except on Sunday, and I hope I can be of real service to you.

Very sincerely yours,
Harvey Brooms
