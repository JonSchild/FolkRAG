[*She also sang a song
 about a rr wreck
 about the McCrees.
 Joe McCree & his father.
 It was real and a true
 song. Don't know 
where or when it 
happened.*] 

[*Mrs. W. 
I used to know an
 old man - he'd be 
job on charity now - who'd
 go around from 
house to house & when
people  wanted to dance
 he'd play old fashioned
 tunes on the violin & 
somebody'd play the
 organ. 

Suggests
 that we
 write to 
Mrs. J.S. Leonard,
[?]
 Pittsfield Village . . 
over 70, some of her 
people were famous
 singers.*]
