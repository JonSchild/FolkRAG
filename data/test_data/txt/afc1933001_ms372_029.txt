Our Western Home

(5)
How often at night
When the Heavens were bright.
By the light of the twinkling Stars.
Have I stood here amazed
And asked as I gazed.
If their Glory exceed that of ours.

(6)
The Air is so clear
The breezes so pure.
The zephyr so balmy, and light.
I would not exchange
My Home here, to range
Forever in azure so Bright.

Chorus
A Home. A Home.
When the Deer and the Antelope play.
When seldom is heard
A discouraging word.
And the sky is not cloudy all Day.
