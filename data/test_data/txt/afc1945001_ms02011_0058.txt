of a less emotional nature will not produce the same result. 
Rumors which are motivated by fundamental anxieties of a person can rarely be 
dealt with effectively at a rational level. While it is true that what may be an expression 
of anxiety for one person, may function very differently for others, since 
the same rumor may have different meanings for different people; nevertheless, we 
should be very careful not to reinforce latent anxieties by calling attention to the 
foci of the anxieties of other people. People's anxieties tend to be pretty 
deeply rooted and simply attach themselves to one thing or another at the level of 
overt manifestation. If a specific detail is eliminated from them another focus will 
be used. For this type of rumor, the indirect attack should be used and most careful 
attention paid to this category by the Education Director. 
Some types of rumors can safely be counteracted directly. These are the rumors 
which do not represent any very strong emotional connection for most of the people who 
transmit them. In this category are preposterous items. Items which tend to strain 
the credulity of the listener, are the best material for direct counteraction. While 
there may be a temptation to feel that this type does not need counteraction, it should 
be remembered that anything that circulates will in time tend to be believed in some
portions of the community. Some items based on belief in magic, superstitions, astrology, 
can be attacked directly. Many people half-ashamedly believe in this type of 
material, on a tentative basis. While there are those who immediately discount superstitions,
if they recognize them, many cherish them secretly. Direct counteraction 
can expose the superstitious and magic aspects of rumors and put the weight of community 
pressure and the current confidence in science against the rumors. Those people who 
reject modern objective approaches will continue to believe in their omens. But the 
large number of people who are "on the fence" can be affected on this front. 
Remember, local rumor projects should work only on local rumors.
