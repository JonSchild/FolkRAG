Now this preacher, when he's come to this certain
community, he always put up with one certain deacon. That
deacon had a right young wife. She was a nice young thing
and the preacher, you know was crazy for her. Every time the
boy would go out to cut wood or something and this gal would pass
by the preacher's door, he'd be beggin her, "Come in, honey,
come in."

"Aw , go on, reverend, you better go on now. I'm gonna
tell my husband on you."

"O no, don't do that, don't do that. Be ashamed of yourself."

So the preacher kept a-worryin her, a-worryin,a-worryin,
so she did tell her husband. He say, "Aw don't pay any 'tention
to the Reverend. That's all right."

"Well, you got to do something about it. I get tired
of the Reverend pesterin me all the time. I ain't studyin him."

"All right," the boy say, "I'll break him up." So this
boy sent her off to her mother's without the preacher knowing and
then told the [???] preacher, " Reverend," say, "I'm
got to go off tonight and I can't be at [your] service. Will you
omit your service tonight and come stay with my wife till I get
back? She scared to stay alone."

"Why sholy, young man, I'd be glad to ," say, "You
know I would. Coloered brethering like you, don't you know I
couldn't afford to turn you down?," say, "If you got to go off
on business or something like that, I'll be glad to omit service
and stay with your wife."
