Rumor Report - Week of August 10,1942
E. Rumors Concerning Jews
1. Have you heard that Leon Henderson is a Jew? A friend of [*6*]
mine, who lives in New York, said that Henderson comes to New York
every week, and is seen in the night clubs with Jews prominent in the
garment industry.
Harrisburg--8/15/42. Middle class. Utilities executive. Character
excellent.
2. The Jews are getting control of all the labor unions and
are planning to strangle the production effort, if the Administration [*6*]
in Washington don't play ball with them. [*7b*]
Harrisburg--8/15/42. Credit manager of department store. Well
known and active in civic matters.

F. Miscellaneous Rumors
1. I heard, from good authority that several of the "Sisters"
at the Lankenau Hospital are involved in the Molzahn case.
Philadelphia--8/12/42. Character good. Slightly below average 
intelligence. Biased in viewpoint on Administration and many phases
of the war effort.
2. It is true the government has relaxed their regulations
on employment within the Government, to the extent that they will
employ "certain" types of aliens?
Philadelphia--8/12/42. Telephone call. Not known personally.
Talked like a person of average intelligence. Was very sure such a
modification had taken place.
3. I heard the allies were forced to do something in the
Pacific, because of the large amount of men and material which had
been assembled in Australia; not because of any fear of Japan and
what she might do. Morale was beginning to crack because of inactivity.
Philadelphia--8/13/42. Character above reproach. Intelligence 
average. Service man.
