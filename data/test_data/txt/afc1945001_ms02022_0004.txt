Special Service Division - 8-8-42

            The six rumors just recited are currently heard in various
degrees of intensity and frequency in the metropolitan section of
Hartford, which includes Hartford, East Hartford, West Hartford,
Windsor and Wethersfield. The writer has only attempted to give the
gist of rumors rather than a verbatim report. This is due to the
variation that is heard of the same general thought as contained in
each specific rumor. The rumor most frequently heard is No. 2, next
would be No. 4, with No. 1 running a close runner-up.

            It could be further stated that the frequency and variations
of these rumors can only be measured by the amount of time one can
expose himself to contact with the general public. The writer does
not know whether it is discreet to offer a suggestion which would be
that, by and large, many of these rumors are passed on through ignorance 
of the effects, which would indicate that a more intensive
drive could be made to educate the serious-minded, loyal American
worker so as to be able to distinguish between the viciously planted,
although subtle type of rumor from the rumor that entails no specific
reaction or harm.

            It is the hope of the writer that this report will contribute
something of informative value to the activities of the Special Division.
