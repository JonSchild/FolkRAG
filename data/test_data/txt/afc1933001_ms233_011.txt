P.S.   Eugenia Williamson of Atlanta, Ga. just called with
her sister and brother and spent practically the whole
morning apologizing about the Meadow's family in Ala. 
They say that the lady who wrote the letter to us is 
off her nut and recommend that you forgive and forget.
They're dying to see you come to Atlanta this trip.
Miss Williamson ( 678 Mooreland Ave., N. E. Apt. 7, )
knows personally the head of the Ga. Prison Commission
and the manager of two local county gangs near Atlanta.
Their stepfathers' brother runs the biggest
plantation in S. Georgia, near Broxto, if you can go
it will take a load off of their minds, and it sounds
like a profitable visit.
