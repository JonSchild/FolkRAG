Out in Connemara I was told the story of a priest who went
to an outlying place one day, and met some old friend of his, an
old man who, by the way, had failed to pay his dues to the
priest for some time past. And for a joke, the priest took
the hat from his head and said to him, "You'll get this hat
back when you pay your dues." Well, the poor old man was
pretending he was in an awful way - and a neighbouring poet - 
a woman poet, actually, wrote a little verse on the subject. . .
SINGS: "I'LL GO TO KANMURE."
Translation:  I will go to Kanmure and collect a bag of
periwinkles, which will pay for me the dues to 
the priest who took off my hat, and left me bald,
and the wind playing round my head for the last
week. From that until evening on his way home,
Matthias - which is Matthew - asked him in a 
mannerly way for his hat. "I won't give it to
you until Sunday is passed, and it would be
better for you if you pay the priest."

SINGS: LULLABYE
Translation: Awa', my baby, awa', my baby, awa' my baby,
And go out baboul. - baboul being the ghost
with which the child is frightened.
