Mr. And Mrs. E. C. Ball
Rugby
Virginia

Dear Mrs. Ball:

My wife and  are coming to Rugby in the next
two or three days with the hope of recording 
some of the songs known to you and other of
your friends in the community.

I hope you will be able to spend an evening
recording these songs for preservation in the
Library of Congress

We look forward to seeing you.

Sincerely yours,


Alan Lomax
