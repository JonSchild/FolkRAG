what I have said in the foregoing
I will in turn deed to you,
after the ten years in question,
all my rights in the books I
have mentioned. I will at
the same time release you
from all or any debts you
are now due me, and 
return to you all the evi-
dences of obligations you
have given me.

This arrangement will
leave you entirely free to
make any arrangement what-
ever or agreement with any-
one about the radio use of
any of the material in the
three books. All that is mine
is yours.
