sense. I found out she was helping this guy to do me up. 
I told her about the conditions and how people wouldn't walk 
in the door. She had some turpentine and she is supposed to 
have scrubbed the walls.  This made it worse.  I decided to beat 
up Harrison Smith.  I was told to catch him and draw blood.  Told 
me to cut up my hand bag in small pieces and throw it in the 
Harlem River. I did it like a fool.  By this time the insurance 
was run out on the car.  It was stolen again and I didn't never 
get it back. 

[*3 or four vials of different kinds of water.*] Mme. Moran--I seen her put her hand on a woman's head and the 
minute her hand got near, she went out like a light.  She put 
the fear right in my heart.  That woman was out for 30 minutes. 
The next Sunday she was out 45 minutes. She had to go to the 
priest to get anointments.  Had to take a bath supposed to be 
worth $25.00. I took one of them baths, too.

I had a trunk with my contracts in and all my write-ups-it was 
stolen.  Had the most extensive repertoire in the world, 10,000 
numbers.  That was stolen along with the bus.  Every time I 
would accumulate a lot of music, it would be gone.  Left my trunk 
at Washington, Pennsylvania. 

[*I stacked them up as high as my head and burned them.*] MMe. Moran personally ordered me to cut every bit of clothes I 
had and burn them.  I always had a lot of clothes and knew I could 
buy some more. 

Reason for leaving trunk in hotel in Washington, Pennsylvania-- 
Boys used to go around and pile up bills.  I went away and when 
I came back they hadn't paid their bills and I had left them $400. 
Kept thinking I would pay the bills.  I said: "I'm sorry but 
I have only enough money to go on my trip."  I left my stuff there 
to keep them from thinking I had money.  All the most important 
tunes I left in this trunk.  I had a raccoon coat and a beaver coat. 
Mother's picture in the trunk, too.  Never went back to the town, 
Always planned to send for it and I never did.  Hats up to $75 
in the trunk, socks up to $5--shoes I never wore less than $18. 

It seems like I'm still blurry about that dog-gone thing in New 
York.  I caught Harrison several times and I swore that I would 
beat him, but when I got to that guy I couldn't  raise my hands. 
I used to keep hats around the office and this guy had the stuff 
all in my clothes. Every  time I put on my hats, it felt like I 
had th Library of Congress on my head.  I spend thousands of 
dollars trying to have somebody take this spell off of me. Had 
jobs and couldn't get men.  Never able to get a band in New York.  
I had to kind of believe those things when they happened.  Went 
to the prosecuting attorney in New York to find out if there was 
any law against people who practiced this thing.  Wanted to put 
Newby in jail to stop him from working against me.
