Hyden, Kentucky 

Dear Alan: 
I was very pleased to not the more optimistic tone of your last 
letter. The records have been sent you by express. It is impossible 
to send such a message by express so you had etter make your own arrangements 
between Hyden and Hazard. Please request records well in 
advance so that you may never be without them. 

Keep forging ahead and to the best you can. We all have confidence 
in your ability and energy. 
Regards: 
Sincerely, 

Acting-Chief, 
Division of Music 

P.S. There is a difference between "not in print" and "out of print." 
My remark was only intended as a humorous[?] warning not to publish the 
statement until you locate the broadside. But please do not develop any 
inhibitions in writing to me! I prefer the free-and-easy style of communication.
