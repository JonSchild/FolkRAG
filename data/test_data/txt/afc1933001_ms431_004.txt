CHISELER'S SORROW

(Tune: 99 Years)
Words by Herschel Phillips, Harriman, Tenn., Hosiery Strike, 1934

Roosevelt said, "Stand up boys,
And dry up your tears;
You've been in distress now
For four long years."
Remember who caused it,
You know it's not right,
Four years of depression,
Are almost for life.

Well I hate a chiseler,
A chiseler hates me.
If I had the power
Here's where they would be-
They'd all be in prison,
And I'd be the judge.
In ninety-nine years, I'd
Still hold a grudge.

We've counted our money,
And counted our time.
We've counted a million
That ain't got a dime.
Come all you good people
Stand up for your right
Four years of depression
Is almost for life.

THE UNION'S CALL

(Tune: Red River Valley)
Words by Herschel Phillips and other students at H.F.S., 1934

Working people must all get together
For the fight that is coming our way.
We must strike and picket together,
that's the way we will get all our pay.

In this struggle, we'll all stand together
For the day that is dawning anew.
We will build on a solid foundation
A Union for me and for you.

For out class we will all stand together
'Gainst the class that has robbed us of all.
In our fight we will tear them asunder.
All the workers respond to this call.

They won't pay us a thing for our labor,
Yet it costs us to live and to eat.
They may starve us and jail us and shoot us,
But our Union will take no defeat.
