plain irish- toothless Irish
- st = sht in PQ
how do you pronounce "sit"
The faces in the streets of Dublin
Abbey Theatre once the morgue, now
untimely restored to its
original purpose."

Kilkenny is the loveliest of all the Irish
Counties-
-
To sleeping wife on wedding night- 
"Could I trouble you again, Miss Regan?"

Let me not leave the world
Until I put off bad luck
Till I have the man that I love
and plenty of land + stock
if I would sleep by his side
Tis short I'd [?] the night
And then the children of Eve
might have their fill of spite.
