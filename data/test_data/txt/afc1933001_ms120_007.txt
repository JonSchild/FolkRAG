My dear Mr. Lomax:

I have not heard from you this spring relative to getting 
recordings of the songs of certain Michigan lumberjacks.  
This is to assure you of my co-operation and to suggest that 
we get some recordings done this spring.  However, I shall be 
in Michigan until August 4; so we could do some work this summer.

One should insist, however, that the best of these men 
are getting old.  Perry Allen celebrated his eightieth birthday 
by appearing with me at a folk performance at Lansing.  Bill 
McBride is approaching eighty too rapidly.  Otis Terpenning 
is only a little under eighty.  Spikehorn Meyers with his tall 
tales and Bill Ellis with his are no longer young.

Your reaction and probably procedure I shall be glad 
to know.

Yours truly,
E.C.Beck,
E.C.Beck.
