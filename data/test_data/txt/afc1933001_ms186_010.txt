wants one and I'd like to see it myself. Halpert
is primed to try to make it have some lay interest.
Any suggestion in regard to Washington
and the printed announcement herein - especially
the Barker-Chase ballad & tall tale lecture-program-
entertainment? We'd like to bring it there, and
(even if the Govt. has made it impossible for
us to get, even rent, a typewriter) would be
glad to send this letterhead-folder to any key
people whose names & addresses you might
have time to send.--Our chief ambition this
season is to make an Army (or Navy) Camp.
We can select staff that would really go over
well with these men-in-service. Maybe
you can give us a steer in this direction
too. We've tried U.S.O - lukewarm. Are trying
Radford specifically; and per Red Cross at Camp
Pickett, Va.--I just wrote the Chairman of the
Joint  A&N Committee on Welfare & Recreation,
Fowler V. Harper---with no better address than
the above--& Washington, D.C.--Our charges are
$50.00 per full day with not too many meetings scheduled, and progressively less for several days in
a row under joint sponsorship of several groups: or
$100.00 a full week, plus all expenses. It was well worked
out - ahead of time - at Pittsburgh.--Let me hear from you
soon.  Yrs sincerely  Richard Chase
