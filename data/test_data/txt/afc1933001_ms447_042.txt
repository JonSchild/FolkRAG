5   John Henry told his capt'in,
"Next time you go to town
A-jes' bring me back a ten-pound maul
Fer to beat yo' steel-drivin' down, oh, Lawdy,
Beat yo' steel-drivin' down."

6  John Henry had a old lady,
An' her name was Polly Ann.
John Henry tuck sick an' he had to go to bed;
Pauline drove steel like a man, oh, Lawdy,
P'line drove steel like a man.

7  John Henry had a old lady,
An' the dress she wo' was red;
Well she started up the track an' she never looked back,
"Gwine where my man fell dead, oh, Lawdy,
Where my man fell dead."

8  Well, they taken John Henry to Wash'n'ton,
An' they bury him in the san',
There's people from the East an' there's people from the West
Come to see such a steel-drivin' man, oh, Lawdy,
See such a steel-drivin' man.

9  Well, some say he's fum England,
Well, an' some say he's fum Spain,
But I say he's nothin' but a Lou's'ana man,
Jes' the leader of a steel-drivin' gang, oh, Lawdy,
Leader of a steel-drivin' gang.
