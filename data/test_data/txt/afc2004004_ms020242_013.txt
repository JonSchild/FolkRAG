     They make a good fire for me an' I stay there. So I stayed
there. Just like that. So[me] many nights I stay in that house an'
I got songs written down now; I just go, go over songs [that] I know,
just go over dis an' go over dat an'...An' just, just, just have a
good time in that house by myself alone. Had enough good --
Had a great, big stove, ya know? An' them big fire, ya know, good,
warm fire? An' I just stayed there.
     So one night... Someone had tol' us, said the -- some kinda
thing that be there in the wintertime. One â€” two, three people
said they had stayed there in the wintertime.  How this 
thing done -- they jus' -- how they walk on the house. Walk
always up, up an' down the house. This thing started walkin'
down on the house. He walk, walk, walk, walk, walk. I say,
"That's a 'coon." 'Cause, you see, anything could be there. 
All them tomatas an' things what they, you know, the big 'mato
factory. That thing walk, walk, walk. He goin' out to the 
other end an' he walk an' he walk. So, when he came along
there by mine, I'd take a broom an' hit the top up there. You
know, tell[in'] 'im to git out, an' git off. An' then look
like he run, ya know? I say, "That's nothin' but a 'coon. Or 
some kinda animal, you know, out there." So well, an' perhaps it
was; I don' know.
     But the next room to me, I had it, had wood in there. But I, 
but I did nailt the door between me an' that room. I would go
outside an' go in the door from the outside an' git the wood.
Ah, my livin' room, nail up the door; I had the door nailed up.
Boy! The first night that was (?) that bugger come in that room
somehow or another, in there. An' did he try to open that do[or]'!
