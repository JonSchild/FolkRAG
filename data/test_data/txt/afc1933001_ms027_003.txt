Dear Dr. Lomax:
 I have this morning your note of the 31st.
t seems to me a little more in accordance with our practice
that the remittances shall be in three installments of
$1500.00 each.  I am therefore authorizing the first one of
$1500.00 which, in accordance with your request, will be forwarded 
to you at Wilton, Connecticut.
I am glad to know that you will be resuming immediately
your work in the field.  With reference to the prospect, I must
admit to a slight concern.  It is the relatively small accumulation 
to date of your two years' efforts.  In stressing to the 
Carnegie Corporation the importance of the work, I should have
felt somewhat embarrassed to have to confess that the results 
of it thus far in our possession are represented by only about
200 records.
I do not, of course, mean to imply that the importance
is to be tested by the number of records produced.  Still, two
hundred seems a small result from so long a period of activity. 
Faithfully yours,
Librarian
P.S  My preference is still to be addressed by
my correct name which is Herbert Putman
and not Frederick W. 
Dr. John A. Lomax
Wilton
