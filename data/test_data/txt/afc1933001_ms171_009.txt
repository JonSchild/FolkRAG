sociologist in Brazil with a recording
machine for nearly a year - Turner
of the Sociology Dept. Perhaps with the
little that has already been done in
S. A. it might be better to go where
[little work] no work has recently been done.
Arrange for father to take a machine
home with him [and] if possible.
Regards,
Alan
