5) Para. 12... My lawyer suggestions the follwoing sort of sentence be added
to this statement. "Provided that nothing be done under this clause that shall
relieve Vanguard from the obligation to pay artists royalties for any records
produced from such matrices, stampers or master recordings.
6) Para 13... lawyer suggest emendation of law sentence to read "in all events
do all such things as may be necessary for the copyright owned by him to be
released and for the sale of records herein contemplated to be effected."
Apparently my lawyer was worried that this para was a sort of preemption
of the copyrights not otherwise protected. I confess I don't understand the matter.
What I do want to tell you is that I am helping to organise a folklore institute
that will channel all folk copyrights, so that wahtever monies are due will
be paid to them for distribution to collectors, arrangers, composers, et al...
This will prevent the development of the present messy situation that is true in
the states.
I am working out an airtight release form with this lawyer which
will work for my trip and will also channel ownership into this institute, so
you needn't bother with that. One thing more. This area is incredibly rich--far
beyond my wildest dreams and the records are going to be extremely exciting---
with Hindu, Spanish, French, English and African material of top quality and in
abundance. So let's get our business cleaned up. Shoot me back the contract
for signature so that I can begin to tie up people as I go along. I can't stand
steel band music.
By the way I would very much like you to keep a fatherly eye on the
Freedom March record and get it broadcast, shipped to Geoffrey Brideon in
England, as soon as possible. Could you let me know about this?

Yours faithfully,

Alan Lomax
