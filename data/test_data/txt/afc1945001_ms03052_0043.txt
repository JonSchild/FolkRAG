Where We're Losing

Leadership of War at Washington Blamed.

By Frank R. Kent.
WASHINGTON, D. C.--Again there is in Washington much talk about how to "shake the country out of its complacency." Administration writers insist that the people must be told that we can lose this war. Intimates of the president declare he is considering making either a statement or a "fireside chat," pointing out the danger and appealing for "whole-hearted sacrifices."
KENT.
There ought to be plain speaking about this. The trouble is not with the people. They are neither complacent nor apathetic.
The trouble is with the war management, which is neither competent, intelligent nor single-hearted.
"Weed Them Out."
That is the simple truth and Mr. Roosevelt would serve the nation better if, instead of assuming that the public needs to be stirred out of its lethargy, he would weed out the incompetents whom he has placed in the highest posts and give the country the sort of leadership it ought to have.
It has not had that kind of leadership and it has not got it now.
The clearest and most convincing evidence of this is the almost incredible mess in which the war management is steeped--a mess which, too obvious to be denied, is gradually being sensed by the people.
This feeling is well founded. It is a fact that the real ability and experience available in America have been either by-passed or barred by the administration.
Hopkins and Henderson.
There are plenty of good men here, but they are not the key men with the real power. It is not necessary to call the roll to prove this.
All one need do is point out that the two most important figures in the picture are those of Mr. Harry Hopkins, who has been directing the gigantic lease-lend operations, at the same time acting in various other capacities; and Mr. Leon Henderson, who as price administrator has almost life and death power over our economic system.
To contend that these two men are the best in the country for their jobs is to be absurd.
Nelson Faint-Praised.
And so far as Mr. Nelson is concerned, while he is honest, earnest and hard-working, he got his job primarily because he had become the favorite business man of the little New Deal group about the president.
When you say that Mr. Nelson is "pretty good" you have just about gone the limit.
The fact is that the job is much too big for the type of men trying to do it. This is unhappily demonstrated by the situation in which after nearly two years we now find ourselves.
Shortages and Inflation.
We find, for example, that through mismanagement, and lack of foresight many factories with war contracts are now threatened with stoppage by the shortage of basic materials, chiefly steel, copper and rubber.
We find, too, that no one here knows the facts about these shortages or what to do about them.
We find further that without a firm labor policy the effort to keep down prices has been futile and that despite the vast amounts expended to prevent inflation, inflation steadily becomes more of a reality.
Taxes and Strategy.
We find that the tax problem has been botched and that the pending bill falls farther short of its avowed purposes than any other tax bill in history.
In the vital business of military strategy, the president has increased confusion by appointing a personal chief of staff  WITHOUT MAKING IT CLEAR WHETHER HE IS TO BE SUPERIOR to the existing chiefs of staff or is to supplement them or co-operate with them.
Further, we find that the submarine attacks upon our shipping, which we were told months ago would be stopped, are becoming more devastating all the time.
Time for Politics.
And finally, we find the president and his aides wasting time and energy of incalculable value upon political activities, which force the conclusion that their thoughts are on the nominee of the next Democratic national convention.

Few men can consider these facts--and they are facts--without being disturbed. It is unthinkable to acquiesce in them and it is not in the national interests to ignore them.
Sickened.
Reflecting upon them, it is rather sickening to be told that the people must be "shaken out of their complacency" and made to realize that the war can be lost.
Of course it can be lost, but THE PLACE WHERE IT CAN BE LOST IS NOT OUT IN THE COUNTRY BUT IN WASHINGTON, where confusion and incompetency reign and politics is smeared all over the White House doorstep.
