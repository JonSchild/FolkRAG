Absences of War Workers From Jobs Cause Concern

Major Industrial Agencies Begin Study of Situation --- 90,000,000 Man-Days Being Lost This Year.

By MONTGOMERY WRIGHT.
          The absence of workers for an occasional day and sometimes for many days in succession from war industries jobs they have been hired to do has become a subject of grave study by nationally known agencies, a canvass here today revealed.
          The National Association of Manufacturers at 14 West 49th street, stated that its careful survey of the situation led it to a reasoned estimate that absenteeism in war industries throughout the nation this year would mount to the total of 90,000,000 man-days. This represents $706,500,000 in wages lost by the absent workers. The value of the war products which might be produced if the absent workers were on the job is beyond computation.
          Recognition of the importance of the absentee problem has caused the National Industrial Conference Board of 247 Park avenue to undertake a comprehensive survey, now nearing completion, with a view to developing some standards for measuring absenteeism and methods of offsetting it.
          "Our survey is not a study of figures," said King McRury, a staff associate of the conference board who is working on the problem, "but information we have obtained points to the conclusion that absenteeism is increasing out of proportion to the increase in the number of workers employed since the war boom started."
     Some Absentee Practices Cited.
          Mr. McRury said that several war industries in the area around New York city reported that workers on a seven-day week showed a marked tendency to collect their extra pay for Saturdays and Sundays and then be taken suddenly ill for a regular mid-week day. 
         In some instances, Mr. McRury said, it was reported that workers would be on the job steadily for some weeks and then take as much as ten days off at a time. Because the worker almost always reports himself as ill during the absent period, it is difficult to gauge the justice of the assertion of cynical doubters that the prosperity and perhaps the honest fatigue of long, steady hours of hard work tempts many war industry employees to check in as ill when they merely feel the need of recreation.
