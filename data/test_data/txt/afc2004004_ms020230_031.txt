BJ:    Potash.
TL:   Oh, potash in it?
BJ:    Um-hum.
TL:    Why do they [put that potash in it?] throw out potash whiskey?
What does that do?
BJ:    Well, it's jus' supposed to eat ya inside.  You know, it
ain't good for ya; it ain't healthy for ya.  A lot of folks put
potash in it to make it strong.  [But] 'Cause they ain't got much stuff in it.
That's just dirty, that's all.  You know, what they do with it,
you know. Been doin'.  But jus' a lil', but not much.  Jus' a lil'
bit of potash.  You can put a top over it, in a jar like, [th] like
that.  An' shake it up?  Or eithâ€™ turn it down.  An' the next mornin'
you can look at it an' tell, 'cause that top is jus', eated, you 
know; look funny.  Then you know potash in [it] [there] ... . That's right, um-hum.
         And you find that it aint got--most of 'em [done] quit that, now.
And these people what runnin' [all] on these stills an' robbin' these 
people's stills an' takin', that ain't se-- they ain't throwed it
out no more.  They carry it on with them an' they put[tin] it in, in,
in be-- in use, an' sellin' it.  It's in, it's in diffrunt place.
Le' me tell you:  I think that's awful, I'm tellin' you.  And they
catch [them] 'em with it, an' they out there workin' on the chain gang
[do] fer it or payin' fer it, they oughta throw it away.  I think
that's real          fraud.  It's sure sittin in -- I, I see some
up in, all the way up in Maryland!  I mean, ah, up here.  No, ah,
Connecticut. Sittin' in the place.  'Cause Rosalie said, "Lookit
there!  That's Georgia!  Well, I declare, they got it up here."
         Then I tol' 'er about it in Waycross, I know they got it.
In Brunswick they got it. An'--all down there, all a them
place [down] up aroun' there, to my knowin'. I mean, you can jus' go about
