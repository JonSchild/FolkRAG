RUMOR: Washington, D. C.
August 4
There are interests in both Great Britain and the United States
who would like to see Germany and Russia continue to fight until both
are nearly exhausted before opening up a second front. The explanation
for this attitude on the part of these persons in high official circles,
according to the rumor, is fear of communism.
