BJ TAPE 10, p. 3 

Tha's the first time I heard that song.  'Cause I -- 'Cause it 
seem like he's sayin' "Bessie" 'till I learn it good; he wasn't 
sayin' "Bessie."  Hah!  I learne[d]t that [from] in Millen.  But I had 
[done] never met those ... 
AL:  When was that? 
BJ:   Ah, that was in, ah, in 1919...Not 1919, 1920.  An' on up 
'till '24. 
[*RE: "The Boll Weevil"
AND BOLL WEEVILS*] 
AL:  There are other of those songs that tell stories.  I wonder
are they always ... "The Boll Weevil" is a nasty song 
BJ:   Yeah. It ain't so nice. 
AL:   I never heard any nasty verses. Maybe they took 'em out. 
I never heard anything, but about:
Boll Weevil, where'd you get your great, big head? 
or 
Why's your head so red? 
and 
Boll Weevil,..
BJ:   Yeah. "What make your beard so long," of sumpin' like that. 
I don't even know -- I know they said, "The boll weevil tol' the farmer..."
What, what the boll weevil tol' the farmer?  See, "Boll weevil..." 
I done forgot it all.  But I... 
Al: but one bale"? 
BJ:  "Boll weevil told the farmer..."
AL: or die in jail"? 
BJ:   "Boll weevil tol' the farmer, you better leave me alone..."
Le's see: "I'll eat all your cotton, now I'm gonna start on your
co'n."  Or sumpin' like that. 
AL:   Yeah.
