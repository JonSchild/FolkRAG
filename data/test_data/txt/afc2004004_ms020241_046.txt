[*--WRITE THE BIBLE, ETC.*]

Um-hum.  Mama calls her mama "Sister," her real mother.  But
that was Leola she was talkin' to.  Leola got so scared.  Leola
said, "I ain't seen Sister.  An' I don't wanna see Sister."  Hum,
hum, ha, ha!  Yeah, that was a lot of fun.  Everytime Mama --
Anytime she git real low sick, she talks with them.  Layin'
there in the bed an' talk with 'em.
AL:  They can give you good advice if you've got the nerve to. . .
BJ:  That's right.  If you've got that kinda nerve, that's right.
They say they can.  But I don't stay there long enough to git
advice!  Ha, ha, ha!  I be gone. . .ha, ha, ha.  An' I. . .
AL:  But there are some people that have the nerve to do that
all the time, aren't there?
BJ:  Yeah.  They just some have got that nerve.  Got that -- Just
like in the Bible, where spirits talk to some peoples an' they,
you know, they talk to 'em.  They fell on their face all right,
some of 'em.  Some said they fell to the ground.  They didn'
run; they fell to the ground on they, on they face, ya know?
An' they heard the voices.  That's why a whole lot a that Book
written up, ya know.  They heard what, what they said, "Write
this," an' ta do so-an'-so an' do so-an'-so.  An' they can't --
Some of 'em couldn't bear to see 'em, but they, but they still,
ah, heard, they heard it.  If everybody had-a run, they wouldn't
a-been no. . .much a Book written.  'Cause it all was sent [a] by
spirit an' angels, ya know?  From God.  An' so. . .
     Some people yet got that kind of a mind; they can talk
with 'em.  If they wouldn't, why, there wouldn't be no spiritualism
people.  You know, them spiritualism people, they talk
to the dead.  Them, them, them folks what calls up the dead an'
all that kinda stuff, ya see.  So somebody yet can do it.
