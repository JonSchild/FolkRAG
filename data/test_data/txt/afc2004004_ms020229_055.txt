AL:  What do you mean "Get behind him"?
BJ:  You know, jus' like it's sumpin' or other -- Jus' like if
he, he'd be comin' out in the field sometime, settin' up out
there. . ."What you don' out there!!"  Just like she talkin' to
her own chilren, ya know.  Aunt Marg'ret. . .oh, he'd be
_____.  He'd go up to her house an' if he wanna eat sumpin',
he'd go up there ta eat, jus' like he always did, jus' like he
was home.  She had, she had a big house, up in the field.
     An' I ain't never heard none of them say nothin' about him
with no, with no colored woman, nothin'.  You know, no out -- oh,
out the way.
     He had a beautiful wife an' one son, to my knowin'.  I don't
think he had but that one child.  But he had a beautiful wife.
An' he was right to his peoples!  He wanted the people to git
along good, he really did.  He even had a church built on the
place an' everything.  On every place he had, he had a church
built there.  But he ain't had no joint build. . .You know, no
jook joints or nothin'.  He had a church built on every plantation
he got, he had a church.

AL:  Would some of the people have joints built on the place?
BJ:  Wel, they -- sure.  Lot of 'em'll let, let the colored
folks have a joint.  Ya know, they gits so, they gits so --
plen'y of places that way now, everywhere.  Ya can git a joint
there befo' ya can git a, a church.  I mean ah, quicker than
they give ya permit for a church.  I mean, I mean, the boss. . .
AL:  Why is that?
BJ:  Well, jus' so crowds gather an' they. . .Tha's all.  Jus' to
gather crowds.
AL:  Do they make a little money out of it?
