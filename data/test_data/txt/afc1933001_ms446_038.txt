I HAVE NO MOTHER NOW

I hear the low winds sweeping
Thro' every bush and tree,
Where my dear mother's sleeping,
Away from home and me.
Tears from my eyes are flowing,
And sorrow shades my brow;
Cold in the grave she's sleeping,
I have no mother now!

I see the pale moon shining,
On mother's white tombstone,
The rosebush "round it twining,
It's just like me — alone.
It's just like me — a weeping,
Cold dew drops damp my brow;
It's just like me — a weeping,
I have no mother now.

My life is, oh, so lonely,
My heart is troubled sore;
Her dearest presence only
Could make me weep no more.
She has gone from me to heaven,
Deep sorrow shades my brow;
The sacred tie is broken,
I have no mother now.

Sad was the hour of parting,
She said in words so sweet —
"My loved ones, I am dying,
We must in heaven meet."
Oh, yes, I'll meet you, mother,
On that eternal shore,
And there we'll live together
Where parting is no more.
Come now, ye orphaned children,
Who sorrow here below.
