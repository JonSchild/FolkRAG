Reverend Roe.  Reel 9.  P. 2
A:  What?
R:  Jonah.
A:  What does that mean?
R:  You know that Jonah was the one that God sent to Nineveh, and he 
tried to run away, keep from going.  You read the story, haven't you?  
Well he said I was a Jonah.
Well I, I -- it worried me so til I left there and went in the country out near Paul's 
Valley, out to a little country town.  And I promised the Lord just if He'd
 just let me get settled out somewhere that I'd go to preaching.  And I 
stopped in there, and that was the time I made a crop and my wife 
taught school.
Well, so I began preaching, but the lord called me to preach because 
there was something outside of myself and it wasn't mean and it wasn't 
school that just pushed me on, that just whilred me, and I justhad it 
to do.  I began preaching there and there on, I had a success; 
in itself helped more than what I could say.  There's a whole lot 
in your daily life, and if you a Christian, there'll be some things 
you can't do.  If you [tried] try it, something will check you.
A:  But even a preacher can have, can sin like other men, can't he?
[*Preachers are tempted*]
R:  Oh yeah, he fall sometime, but he's not gonna lay [down all] there [lay?] if he's a 
god-sent man, brother, he'll get up.  Yes sir, and then another 
thing he'll acknowledge it and quit it.
A:  What are the temptations that a preacher is most liable to?
R:  Well, I'll tell you the truth: the greatest temptation to any 
male in the world is women - that's our greatest temptation because 
that's [on the] out of habit, it's nature.  And there's so many of us that won't 
abide by the laws of nature. [--when] We see something, that we just 
went to break over anyway, and most of [em] um will sometime.  That's the 
truth.  Of course, there is men that just don't want [anything of it] to acknowledge it,
