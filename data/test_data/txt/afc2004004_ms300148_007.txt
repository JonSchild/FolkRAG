Dear Allen & Shirley,
Hope this finds you OK. We are doing
Very well I guess, I mailed you the contract
Hope you rec. it, thought it could of got lost in
the Christmas rush, everyone around hear is
excited about it.
thought I would ask you if it would be
alright to sing the songs on our Radio & T.V.
Programs? or would it be best to wate until
their out?
We or doing a lot of Singing & Playing get
more Call than we can fill.
Hope you had a nice Christmas we did,
Best wishes to you both.
Respectfully
E.C. & Orna Ball

[*Okay to play 
& sing but not

copyright. Will be sending you your advance within
ten days. Records all
set but
