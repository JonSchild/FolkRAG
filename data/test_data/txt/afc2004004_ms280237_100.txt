Lomax: Just pick a labourer out of the fields and go on with him?
Cox: Mm. That was - then. Course they don't do it now. I don't
know what war. I don't know all the song about it. An' there's
one thing; I don't know one song, an' you don't know a song not without
a woman bein' mentionedin it. There ain't one can sing a song in
a hundred without a woman bein' mentioned in it. I only know one.
Lomax: What's the one?
Cox: I only one; Bala - Balaclava I call it. I don't know what. . .
that's what it is.
Kennedy: The Balaclava Charge?
Cox: Yeah, that's the one. That's the only one I know
without a woman bein' in it. I don't know another one
without. They all got women in them. (pause)
Kennedy: . . .he's got stocks of sea battles. Haven't you, Harry?

Lomax: No.
Kennedy: Blackberry Fold?
Cox: Yeah. Have you heard it?
Kennedy: I've heard of it Harry.
Lomax: Sounds good. Sounds like a right righteous song. Go ahead,
let's try it.
Cox: Well, I'll just - just get it started off an' you'll hear
what I mean. What? No. (slight pause)
