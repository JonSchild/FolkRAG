I have written a song United American which 
would fit the movie. United we stand much better
than the tripe they used. I may not write perfect
from a poetical stand point. As I object to discarding
what makes sense for perfect rhyming. But old
folk songs were not lyrically perfect. But I can 
beat Cole Porter a mile on fitness to a play. If I do 
say it as shouldint. Yet publishers daren't take
yours for fear of being boycotted by Porter and his ilk. 
I also have a rollicking war song something like
the old Yankee Doodle. And stresses keeping your
lip buttoned up on war information. And yet is not
"sob stuff" would you be interested enough to 
examine them? And I will mail them
to you to prove my point. That they have no good
war songs because they are holding out all beginners.
If you are interested in old songs. That are really old. 
I will send you a list of some I have
