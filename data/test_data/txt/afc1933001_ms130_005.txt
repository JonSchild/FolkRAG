Dear Mr. Lomax:

In reply to your request for a copy of 
song relative to Sherman Cyclone, wish to advise that 
we have made an earnest effort to get this information.

We have contacted all parties who would 
likely know about it and one of them recall such a 
song, however one of these parties stated that a verse 
or poem was written by the late H. L. Piner with title 
"The Storm".  This party further states that a newspaper 
story linked this poem with the Sherman Cyclone, but in 
reality it had no definite relation to the local tragedy.

Yours very truly,
SHERMAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
Frank M. Thompson
MANAGER
