LULUANNA
I know a little cot as humble as can be,
It stands on the banks of the Susquehanna,
Where the wild flowers bloom and the humming birds play,
Oh, there lives my sweet Luluanna.

(Chorus)
She is fair as the dawn, as mild as the eve,
And as graceful as the bold Susquehanna;
She is my ideal, an Angel of the earth,
The idol of my heart is Luluanna.

If I were a fish I would swim by her side,
As she sails on the bold Susquehanna;
I would dream of her by night,  I'd think of her by day,
Till I won the heart of Luluanna.
