Mr. Ricardo Archuleta

Cerro, New Mexico

Dear Mr. Archuleta:

Before you can be paid for the records you were kind 
enough to give us permission to release, you will have to
sign the voucher that has already been mailed to you and
return it to us. Please do this at once so we can send
you your check for $18.00.

If you have not received the voucher, let me know 
promptly and another will be sent to you. The records are
not yet ready, but they will be soon and yours will be sent
to you at once. 

Cordially yours, 

AL s
