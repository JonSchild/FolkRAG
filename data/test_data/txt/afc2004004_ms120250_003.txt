making me learn and also remember what I had forgotten.
The Haitian people are a warm, courteous nation and you
are not going to be sorry that you came.  But come you must!!
Bill me for the material you suggested.  Fifty is not
too much.I agree with you about the first copies.  No, I havent
a Cine' but I am dickering for one here.  Wrote my publisher
to lend me one if he has one around.  The scenery here is so
lovely!  You are coming to the conclusion that I have lost
my head, but wait till you see it all!  I am doing some very
interesting work with a box camera but maybe I better get
a better one that is sharper.  If you could just buy me three
pairs of stockings, color light, golden tan, size 10 at about
$1.00 a pair.  I've got the money here for whatever you feel 
is needed in equipment, you understand.
Here['s] looking forward to your safe and soon arrival here
in the land of sunshine and flowers and music. My regards to
your father and please assure him that I am not out of my head
with climate.
Affectionately,
Zora

Congratulations on getting money!  Hooray!
Why cant I buy a Victrola, such as you say,
is so important to us?  I could use it later. Bring 
it, Alan, if its not over $70.00
