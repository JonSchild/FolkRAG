and Company, take charge over here after

serving as his Chief high executioners,
I think one of his first
acts should be to line up the entire
fiscal department of the Library of
Congress, with the said Harold Spiracke
as the central figure, and shoot 'em
for rank inefficiency. I waited a 
year and three months for my last
settlement, finally made for less
than half they owed me on unquestioned
