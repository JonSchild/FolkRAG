LARRY: 
Count it up. A lot of things he could do being blind. So, I think he wanted to go back down South didn't he? 
MRS. DAVIS
Well he often felt a lot of times when everything I have get paid for I'm going back South. As a matter of fact I didn't want him to buy a house here in New York, I wanted him to buy a house in Raleigh, N.C. because; houses were cheaper, there was so much high tax payings here in New York, but he had planned someday he would go back there and buy land but didn't work out. 
LARRY: 
Well he always was a spiritual man, wasn't he Mrs. Davis. I mean his music. 
MRS DAVIS: 
Yeah well I'll tell you the truth, I didn't want Rev. Davis to get into the music world. I did not, I pleaded so hard for him not to get into the music world because I know when he get into the music world, he'd do a lot of numbers that are fancy that he shouldn't a did being in the Ministry. 
LARRY: 
Yeah, well I think sometimes he just played to fill out you know. 
MRS. DAVIS 
Well he did. He played them to fill out and then the boys were taking lessons. They would do different numbers and if they were going to give lessons
