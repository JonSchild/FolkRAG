Geol. Society. Then back to Webb 
Co. However, if you still want to 
catch mackerel and can stand my 
company, I'd like to connect up 
with you at Pt. Aransas in about
 10 days or so. I'd surely enjoy
 the association and sport.

All this country had a 
big rain which is worth plenty
 to it.

Had 3 runs of hard
 luck in past 24 hours: washed 
the car which is now mud 
splattered, broke my glasses (first
 time, ever), and also broke my bridge!

Something's bound to turn the 
other way.
