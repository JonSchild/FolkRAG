[*12.10.55...] A I think it is interesting that the stories
have grown - I mean, let me say this way -
that America's been built out of storytelling.
I mean when two - when people get together,
they tell stories, much more than sing songs,
although that's been important in a lot of
ways. But the anecdote is the big American
thing. Lincoln told anecdotes in his political
points, and so do all American politicians,
and for these people here who are masters of
the country anecdote, when I was young, they
lasted, oh, 10 minutes or 5, 15 minutes. Now
they're getting - they've begun to get shorter.
Bob Hope's are quite short and now we're at
the age of one-liners. But the points are all
the same really. Ah, the points sorta make
- bring people together for a laugh, but, ah,
this is a way of uniting people, and this was
 their function in those days.

What's dropped out, which is rather a shame,
and has been turned over I think maybe to
fiction writers for the media, is the whole
ah art of ah preparing you for sleep in the
best way, which the old stories did.
