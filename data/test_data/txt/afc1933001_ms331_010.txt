Lord Donand's Wife

The first stepped in was a gaily girl,
The next was Lord Donald's wife,
"Go home, go home, with me this night
And stay [all night] with me." all night."

There was a little foot page a-staning nigh,
He heard the trade well made,
He ran, he ran to the river bank
And he fell to his breast and he swam.

He swam to the other shore.

"What news, what news my little foot page,
What news in such a haste,
Is either of my castles down
Or is my men post-paid."

"[Neither of your castles]  
"There is neither of your castles down,
There is neither your men post paid,
But little Mattie Grow's gone home with your wife,
Your wife all night with her for to stay."

"This news, this news you have brung to me,
If proven to be true,
I'll give to you my daughter Jane
And married you shall be."

"This news, this news you've brung to me,
If proven to be false,
Tomorrow I'll have your scaffold built
And hanged you shall be."

"This news, this news I've brung to you,
If proven to be false,
You need not have no scaffold built,
You can hang me on some tree."

Lord Donald marched his men up fifty yards,
he was fifty yards or more,
Then give them [?] his command not a man to move,
Or nary a horn to blow.

But there was one man in Lord Donald's crew,
Gave thanks to Little Mattie [Grove] Grow,
He clapped his trumpet to his mouth
And blowed it loud and shrill.

"Rise up, rise up, for I must go,
Lord Donald's coming now."
