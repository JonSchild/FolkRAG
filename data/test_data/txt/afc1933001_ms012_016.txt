Dear Dr. Lomax: 
I have your note of the 26th and have seen the one of the same
date to Mr. Engel.
I am drawing at once upon the Carnegie Corporation for the actual 
remittance of the sum voted, or at least one-fourth of it to cover the
first quarterly instalment.  Immediately upon receipt of it, which should
not be delayed, we shall be sending you a check for that amount,- $750.
This is in accordance with your preference to have the first advance cover
the first three months.
A fortnight before the conclusion of that period, you had better
remind us that a second instalment should follow.
As to the report of disbursements:  We quite appreciate the impracticability 
of complete vouchers or af a completely itemized statement.
If, however, you can conveniently report at the end of each quarter (1)
the itinerary covered, and (2) the major items of disbursement, supplying
any receipts for the latter that you would in any case naturally retain,
such a report might be useful if only to show a disposition to conform to
the ordinary procedure.
Faithfully yours, 
Librarian
Dr. John A. Lomax
