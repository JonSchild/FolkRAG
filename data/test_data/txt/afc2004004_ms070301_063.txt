Courtship
Do you dream of me
Faith I can't sleep dreamin
of you.

I wish I was in jail
for stealin ye.

No!

Then I wish you'd been born
twins so I could have half of
you.

Ah, said a girl to a boy, if you
were me & I were you, I would
be married long ago!

- Sure no man could equal
me now than in [bindurs?].

Mary, will you do what
Maggie axed ye to

I'll never spake to you anymore
Than kep your spake to yourself
I'm sure I could get along without
it!
