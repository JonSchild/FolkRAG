June 28, 1938.
Mr. John Hammond,
178 Sullivan Street,
New York, N.Y.
Dear Mr. Hammond:
I fear you're not in for any somersaults, perhaps
a couple of gentle cart wheels. Jelly Roll was
my first experience at piano recording; and, besides,
his hands are a little stiff because of
lack of care and very strenuous use. What you
may be surprised at, however, is his singing. I
know I am quite unsophisticated as regards swing
music, but I think he is a better  singer than Louie
Armstrong, which is going pretty far.
Besides this, Jelly Roll is, as you say, not warm
and unostentatious as so many of the Negro musicians
I have known have been. In fact, he is, as
a person, a complete revelation to me because my
contact with music has always been through folk
musicians. The more time I spend with Morton, however,
the more interesting he becomes and I have
grown to believe that he is significant just because
he is distinct from his own kind; in him one can discover
the divergent and at some times conflicting elements
that have gone into the making of jazz culture. He
runs the whole gamut, from voodoo to shoddy commercialism.
We have a great deal to talk about, I think, and I
look forward with great pleasure to your coming to
Washington as soon as that may be possible. If you
can steal a day or two to go over the material in the
Archive, I think we can both learn a great deal. Let
me know as soon as you can when you can come down, as
I shall be leaving town for the summer on or before the
15th of July.
Cordially yours,
Alan Lomax
