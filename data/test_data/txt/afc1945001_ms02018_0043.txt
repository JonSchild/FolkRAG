Profiteering
1.  The big interests make money out of the war--they always have
and always will.  (Soldier from Luke Field, met on street.  8-10-42, 
Phoenix.)
2.  The war profiteering that is going on makes it bad for the 
people at home and for the soldiers, too.  (Soldier on street.  Phoenix, 
8-12-42.)
3.  After the war I would like to see all the profiteers rounded
up in a pen and shot.  Just penning them up wouldn't be enough.  There
are plenty of others who think the same way I do.  (Carpenter, American, 
55 years of age.  Phoenix, 8-12-42.)
4.  We soldiers are going to do the fighting while the big fellows
get rich profiteering.  After the soldier boys get home there will be
something doing.  (Overheard conversation between soldier and civilian.
Phoenix, 8-14-42.)
5.  It is no time for all the crooked business that is going on in
the country.  The bankers have always been among our worst profiteers.
Businessman, about 55 years of age, intelligent, met in Library Park.
Phoenix, 8-14-42).
6.  We know that profiteering is going on and we do not like it.
