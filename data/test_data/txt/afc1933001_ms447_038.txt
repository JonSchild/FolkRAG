3 Well, Methuselah Was the oldest man,                       25
The oldest man Ever lived on earth,
He lived nine hundred And sixty-nine,
And died and went to Heaven, Well in due time.

4 Joshua Was the son of Nun,
And God was with him Until his work was done.
God opened the window And began to look out,
The ram horn blowed And the children did shout,
The children did shout Till the hour of seven,
Till the walls fell down An' God heard it in Heaven.

Choruses:

Ah, weep on, Mary,
Weep on, Mary,
Oh, weep on, Mary, in the mornin'.

Oh, mourn on, Marthy,
Mourn on, Marthy,
Oh, mourn on, Marthy, in the mornin'.

THE MAN OF CALVARY

Reverend Sin Killer Griffin is pastor of one of the largest congregations
in the world--the Negro convicts of the penitentiary. This is a fragment
of his Easter Sunday sermon, transcribed from a group of records made in
1934. His sermon is at once poetry and song and must be chanted and sung
in a highly dramatic manner. (See records mentioned in the bibliography
for the manner of rendition.)

I Roman soldiers come ridin' at full speed on their horses and splunged
Him in the side.
We seen the blood and water come out.
Oh-h, Godamighty placed it in the minds of the people,
Why, the water is for baptism
And the blood is for cleansin'.
I don't care how mean you've been,
Godamighty's blood 'll cleanse you from all sin.
I seen, my dear friends,
The time moved on. . . .
I seen while he was hangin',
The mounting begin to tremble on which Jesus was hangin',
The blood was dropping on the mounting,
Holy blood, dropping on the mounting,
I seen about that time while the blood was dropping down,
One drop after another,
I seen the sun Jesus made in creation;
The sun rose, my dear friends,
And it recognized Jesus hanging on the cross.
