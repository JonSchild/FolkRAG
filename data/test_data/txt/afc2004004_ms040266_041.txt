Have you ever visited Staithes,
a fishing village on the Yorkshire
coast? I was there in 1938
and heard more singing than
anywhere else - a man singing
a bawdy folk song as he
milked a cow, families
singing hymns as they sat
on the hillside. On Sunday
mornings fishermen used to
walk through the village to
St. Peter's Church singing as
they went. In the evenings
the young men, despised by
the older generation because
they had given up fishing
to go into the mines, would
gather round the harbour bar
