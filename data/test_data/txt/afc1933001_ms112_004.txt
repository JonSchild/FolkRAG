colder than in years and 
 it has stayed cold., too.
lThe fine looking 
New Years packed his 
things and made an exit
from his first semesters 
matriculation in the U of T. 
I doubt if he attended classes 
enough to stay in school
much less to take examinations. 
Too bad. The same thing may
happen to Joe Curetoun also.
I have a young married couple
that will come in tonight 
and I believe will stay with 
me the nest semester.  No other 
prospects. 
Wishing for you great
joy & health in this out
New Year I am 
With deepest love
 Sister Alice.
