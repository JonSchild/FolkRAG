And he sat on a stone not far from her window; and she says. . .
Who's that at my chamber window
Depriving me of my long night's rest?"
and he speaks back. . . .

I'm soaking to the skin."
The man that I heard sing it was a great banjo player in Dublin,
Teddy Fury. It was him that learnt me it. But he would always go

I used to say, "Sing an air, Fury." He wouldn't try learning
it. Just a couple of verses. . .
Lomax: Did you ever hear any Peterhead fishermen's songs? They
do have ballads up there among the fishermen.
Davy: Well, aye, but I never picked up much sea-ballads, no. No
fishermen's ballads at all. Mostly the farm servants. I never mixed
with fishermen very much. Mostly the ploughman that I mixed with.
Lomax: Do they have any songs that are not quite proper - that

Davy: There were songs - dirty ones. What you call in Scotland
"a streak of blue." Aye. Same as the Ball of Kerrymuir. I've lots
of dirty songs myself. . .

4) She give to him a hammer noo, which he would start to knock.
To let the ladies know when the tinker started work.
5) She went up the stairs noo, to see what he would do,
She jumped into a featherbed and the tinker jumped in, too.
6) She says, "You've done me in the kitchen, me boy, you've done me in the hall,
But that pixy old greasy cook, he canna do it at all.
