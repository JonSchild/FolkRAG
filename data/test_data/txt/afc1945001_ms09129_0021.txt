Guardhouse cook
A army cook who
had been in service
for a period of two years
without seeing any
action was finally 
sent across to Africa. 
The first day upon
arriving his company 
was hungry and
they demanded food, 
but low and be-hold
the cook had disappeared. 
Upon searching the 
company came upon
the cook who had
wandered out almost
to the front lines 
and he had killed 
4 German soldiers, 
one a Major. Upon
returning to camp
he was put in the 
guardhouse, but 
he didn't mind
it a bit. When 
questioned he
just said, "I waited
a period of two
years to do that
and just couldn't 
wait any longer.
