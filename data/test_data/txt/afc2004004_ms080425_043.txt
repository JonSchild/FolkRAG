Tape:  #221  Sacred Harp  1

     What art does and will, it speaks to the heart of what is
good and true, and as I said a minute ago, I have great difficulty
knowing how to talk about it, knowing what words to use to
describe it.  But in a setting like this with people like these,
when we take the patting hand for example, and I see uncle Bob
Dinson who may or may not be here the next time and who knows I
