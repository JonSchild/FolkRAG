I was a little kid and I remember that.  On the TV, and on
the radio, if I hear him, I didn't miss him.  I hear the way
they play.  We all play different style, so I recognize. . . . . . 
. . . . . . . On my daddy's family, all the family play accordion.
ALl the family.  And on my mama's famuly, it's almost the same
thing.  So I think it come from that way.  You know it come
from the family, and I was the only one in my family that
play, 7 in my family, and I'm the only one that plays.
AL:  That must have made your daddy and mama feel very happy.
Octa:  Oh yes, The first little music I had was one of the
little music. . . . and I liked the music so much that we hire
a man, he live in the little house, work for my daddy, and he
had a chimney, and some kind of way he went down a little
bit, so if you wanna fool me, give me a box of [dust] dirt, I giv
you that little music.  Oh, I was too glad to do it.  So I went
outside, bring 2 buckets, go to him, he give me that little
music.  Costs about 15 or 20 cents.  So he give it to me. . . . . . .
harmonica.  And I started-I startedplaying on that, I learne
that just like that, and I was sitting outside the house on
the step and I was playing, and my daddy asked the other
ones in the house, he said, who play that music.  They say,
that's Octa.  He say, where he get that little music?  Nobod
knew.  Well, He opened the door, and he said, where you get
that?  I told him, I said the Galban, name of the guy was Galban
I say Galban gave it to me.  You sure you didn't steal that?
