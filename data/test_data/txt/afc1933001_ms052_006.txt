Dear Miss Prink:
The galley proofs of the new Lomax book of
Cowboy songs will be sent to you this week. I
realize that I have had them a long time, but
just before Mr. Lomax left for Europe he brought
me the galley of the text which needed some revision
that he lacked time to do.
When I return the material I shall send you
an accompanying letter with a few final instructions
regarding the printing. These will be very
important, for in some respects the work of your
music printer is questionable.
Sincerely yours,
ENW
mr
