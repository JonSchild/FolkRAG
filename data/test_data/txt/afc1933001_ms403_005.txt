ALEX MOORE & CAPTAIN NYE
THE BALLAD HUNTER

There are few men left who can sing cowboy songs after the manner of
the men who went up the trail from Texas to Wyoming and Montana.  These men
did their singing and cattle-calling in the open - [against] facing the wind and
out in the cold and rain.  They had no time nor inclination to put any
particular musical frills on their songs.  One day on the Colorado River
in Texas I found Alex Moore - probably sixty years old - who, it seems
to me, sings cowboy songs after the traditional manner of [the] trail
days.  His repetroir included such songs as "THE SIOUX INDIAN", "CHISHOLM
TRAIL", "THE DYING COWBOY", "I'M ALEAVIN' CHEYENNE", "WAY OUT IN OLD WYOMING",
"BOGGY CREEK", "ZEBRA DUN", "LITTLE JOE THE RINGLER."  In found Alex living
in a two-room shack.  Since his ranging days he'd fallen on hard lines
and he and his wife were now drawing twenty-eight dollars a month on
the relief rolls.  I carried Alex up to my home so that we might have
quiet and some comfort for his singing.  We talked in between songs.
