Bulter 126 - 7th
My uncle is a Staff sergeant 
in the army, and because the clothes
the army furnished him weren't 
what he expected, he bought his own
suit. On his first leave he was proud
of his new suit and took great pleasure
in showing it off. 
When he returned to camp
he did something which landed him
in the guard house, and of course, he
lost his stripes and his new suit. 
He was a staff sergeant no longer
just a poor Private. He was embarassed
to death. 
On his next leave he was
still Private and didn't enjoy his
trip. He's back in camp now and has 
won his stripes back. You can bet, 
he won't buy another suit because
in his letters he keeps saying, "I'll 
never do that again."
