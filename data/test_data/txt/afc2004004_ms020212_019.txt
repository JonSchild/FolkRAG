Dear Alan, 

Am forwarding herewith a letter dated Sept. 16th, received 
from Mr. William A. Koshland of Alfred A. Knopf Inc. 

The lyrics referred to, to be incorporated in Miss Shirley 
Ann Grau's book, apparently come from your sources and 
would appreciate your letting me know how you want the 
credits to read, if the songs are, in fact, derived from 
your source. 

All best, 
Al
