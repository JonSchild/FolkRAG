Dear Mr. Spivacke:

Mr. Green selected about
forty records to be used in
his six proposed programs
for the British Broadcasting Corporation.
When I left they were
in the archives. One of the
colored boys of the Music Division
was to ship them on
Mr. Greene's request, retaining
a list for Alan's records. I
also have a list. We had
no further discussion about
your special? conditions on this
batch of records. Several of them
are originals. Notice what he
says about them in the enclosed
letter. I hope that everything
