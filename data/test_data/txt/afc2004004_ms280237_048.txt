p.9, H. Cox, 2.12.53

They led me to my office, and led me up to bed,
But layin by a soldiers side I never felt afraid
But pullin off my old red coat, I used to laugh and smile
To think myself a drummer, and afemale all the while.

A female all the while, a female all the while
To think myself a drummer, yet a female all the while.

My waist is long and slender, my fingers long and small
So very soon they taught me how to play the best of all,
I played all on my kettledrum as other drummer's play,
I played all on my kettledrum and I'll bate the drum again.

I'll bate the drum again, I'll bate the drum again.
I played all on my kettledrum and bate thedrum again.

They sent me up to London, to be guard in the Tower
And there I might have been until this very day and all
A young girl fellinlove with me, she said I was a maid
She went straightway to my officer, mysecret betrayed
secirit
My secret betrayed, my secret betrayed
She went straight way to my officer, my secret betrayed.

My officerhe he sent for me to hear if this wastrue,
And I all for to beat him    a tale already knew
A pension for your reward, he smiled as he said,
It's a pity we should lose you, such a drummer you made.

Such a drummer as you made, such a drummer as you made
It's a pity we should lose you such a drummer as you made.

So far you well my officer you have been kind to me,
Fare youwell my compreres, you ne'er forgot shall be,
Should the British Army fall short of any man,
I'll put on my hat and feather, and beat the drum again.

I'll beat the drum again, I'll beat the drum again
I'll put on my hat and feather and I'll beat the drum again.
