In a country of share-croppers and large plantations
owned by white men, like the Red River bottom country, old man Wess
Ledbetter was a Negro conspicuous for his independence and
success. He had risen from the position of a renter to that
of a small landowner. He voted at every election, always the
Republican ticket. He must have been an intelligent and
energetic farmer, for the whites of his community [certainly]
respected him and the sherif was always easy on his son, Huddie.
Huddie was his only child and the old man and his
half-Indian wife, Sallie, both spoiled him. [He lorded it in the house.]
