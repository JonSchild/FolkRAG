RAIDERS ALL ARE WE

Over hill, over dale,
On the sea and on the trail,
We Raiders go raiding along
First we're her,
Then we're there,
Chasing the enemy everywhere,
Keep those Raiders a-rolling along.

Then it's Hi Hi Ho.
Raders all are we.
We shout it out in voices loud and strong
With our tommies and M ones
We'll get those sons of guns
As we Raiders go raiding along.
