War Jokes etc.

1. A few months ago my uncle on 
maneuvers, in Maryland.  He said
a man was driving in a car, and was 
going over the bridge.  My uncle stop
the car and told the [told] driver,
that he couldn't go any further.  Because 
the bridge [was] had been
bombed.  The driver thought the solider
was a little bit crazy, and so turn
around and [???] went back.
2.  While there is gas rationing,
tire rationing and shoe rationing
a person might as well stay
