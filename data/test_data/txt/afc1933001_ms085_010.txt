Dear Mr. [?]: I have found and
enclose the letter you wrote to me
last April. In November, 1940, I
rendered the Library an itemized account
of all the money I had paid and
for incidentals on my last ballad
hunting trip. I swore to it. There
was no possible chance that the
amount would increase as other
new items turn up. Miss Rogers
helped me get the account in proper
form. She understood that it was
my last claim and for some
time she tried to get the account settled
From time to time Mr. Spivacke
has put his shoulder to the wheel
