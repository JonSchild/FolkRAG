     I was jes sayin to you, thass a boy chile.  Jes because
you nuss that chile an put a napkin when he was a baby, do you
think you ought to set down an tell that chile anythang?
     (Why I don't know.)
     Thass what I'm tryin to tell you now.  Naw, you should
not!  Even though it's yo own chile, but you shouldn't do it.  But
it should know it though.  You realize it should know it.  But why
no pick out some man that's some relation to you?  Talk wid the
chile.

     Well. . .I'm jes tellin you how it sposed to be done.
I didn't tell you how I come by my knowledge about it.  I'm jes
tellin you how it sposed to be done.  An I must know what I'm talkin

     (Did you hear other children talk?)
     No.  I didn't heah othah chilren talk.  I'd heah the

If they'd knowed I was listenin you undersan they'd tear
my backyard all to pieces.  They sent me to bed to go to sleep.

folks ought to be careful bout what they say.  You whup him much as
you please, that don't make him go to sleep.  Nother thang I'm mon
