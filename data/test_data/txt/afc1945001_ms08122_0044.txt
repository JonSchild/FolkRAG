A

Medical Aide

     This is the story of how a little
medical aide named Epstein patched up
wounded men in face of enemy fire.
On Guadalcanal a unit was ordered to go on
patrol and Epstein as a medical aide
accompanied his unit. He carried no guns
or weapons of any kind. These men were
trapped by the Japs and had to lie still
for hours.
     When a man was shot, Epstein
crawled out in the face of enemy fire,
and patched the soldier up. A second got
it, Epstein went out in the open again,
and tended the victim. The third time
Epstein went out to minister a wounded
comrade who lay in a heavy concentration
of machine-gun fire, Epstein was killed.
     He might have escaped but he chose
to stay to tend his wounded comrade. When
this soldier got back to his company he
was crying, and told the men, Epstein was bleeding
to death. They found him dead.
