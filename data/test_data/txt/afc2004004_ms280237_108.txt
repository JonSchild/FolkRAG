The first he called was his eldest son,
He said, "My race is almost run.
If to you the mill I will give
Now tell me what toll you mean to have;
If to you the mill I will give
Now tell me what toll you mean to have.

He said, "Father, my name is Ralph -" Was it? Jack.
He said, "Father my name is Jack,
Out of every coomb I'll take a peck.
An' every coomb that I do grind,
Look what a good livin' - shall find.
An' every coomb that I do grind,
Look what a good livin' I shall find."

That's what you mean isn't it?

"You are your father's eldest babe,
You have not larnt your poor father's trade.
So to you the mill I don't give,
You take such toll no man can live,
An' so to you this mill I don't give,
You take such toll no man can life."

The next he called was his second son,
He said, "My race is almost run.
An' if to you the mill I do give
Now tell me what toll you mean to have,
An' if to you the mill I do give
Now tell me what toll you mean to have."

He said, "Father, my name is Ralph.
Out of every coomb I will take half.
An' every coomb that I do grind,
Look what a good livin' I shall find,
An' every coombe that - do grind
Look what a good livin' I shall find.

"You are your father's second babe,
You have not learnt your poor father's trade.
So to you the mill I don't give,
You take such toll no man can live,
So to you the mill I don't give
You take such toll no man can live."

The next he called was his youngest son,
He said, "My race is almost run,
If to you the mill I will give
Now tell me what toll you mean to have.
And if to you this mill I do give
Now tell me what toll you mean to have."
