Mr. Huddey Ledbetter
356 West 52nd Street,
New York City.

Dear Huddey:

Just now I don't have time to arrange anything for you here in Washington.  I am leaving on a two months field trip this Friday and won't be back until fall.  However, I will come by to see you next week-end in New York and we can talk things over.

With love to Martha and Miss B
I am,
Sincerely your friend,
Alan Lomax
