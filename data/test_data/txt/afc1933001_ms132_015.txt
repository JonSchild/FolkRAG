Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Coar:

I regret that I have as yet received 
no word regarding the recording 
project which I spoke to
you about. But inasmuch as a note
in the newspaper revealed that the
professor who made the inquiry was
on a speaking tour, his delay in
placing the order is not at all surprising. 

I shall try to visit your studios 
at the first opportunity which
will probably be some time in May.

Very truly yours,

Acting-Chief,
Division of Music
