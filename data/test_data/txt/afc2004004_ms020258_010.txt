BEAULAH LAND

Chorus:  Beaulah land, beaulah land
              I got a home in that beaulah land. (2)
1)  Well I got a home in beaulah land
     Not gonna stop 'til I reach that land
                                reachin' that land
     But I'm gonna [?????] meet my mother in Beaulah land. (chorus)

2)  Well [way] way down yonder on Jordan's shore
     Well there we'll meet to part no more
Well              to part no more
For I'm gonna meet my mother on Jordan's shore.  (chorus)

3)  Down in Babylon at a field
     Ezekial saw that wheel in a wheel
                     that wheel in a wheel
But I just want to know how a chariot feel.  (chorus)

4)       on Jordan's shore
    Well angels said the time would be no more
    Well some come crippled and some come lame
    Lord I'm happy                 Jesus' name. (chorus)

5)  Jordan's river is chilly and cold
     Chill my body but not my soul
    Well God's gonna take me by my body and soul[s]
    I'll meet my mother in Beaulah land.   (chorus)
