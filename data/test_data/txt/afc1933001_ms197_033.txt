Dear Alan:

     We were unable to locate the Henry King Family.
Our registered letter addressed to Visalia and General
Delivery, Thornton, California were returned marked "unknown."
Charles Todd and Robert Sonkin recorded them.
     By the mountaineer's courtship ballad, I presume
you are referring to Jenny Jenkins. Mr. and Mrs. E.C. Ball
of Rugby, Virginia are the singers and as far as I know, they
are still living there. The blind ballad singer is Horton
Barker of Chilhowie, Virginia. Having received a release from
him recently for one of Charlie Seeger's Barbara Allens, I 
know he is still alive.
     I shall be glad to give Mr. Spivacke your message.
With best wishes,

Sincerely yours,


(Mrs.) Rae Korson
