Analysis can best be done by persons trained in social psychology.
Local universities will generally have some such experts on their
staffs can be recruited to serve in the project and supervise the
analysis. Rumor analysis should tell what rumors are being spread, with
what frequency, in what circles. Such analyses show what the problems
our, how serious they are, and toward whom information must be directed.

Once it has been decided to blanket a given field with information,
every outlet open to the project should be used. It is important
to reach every group in the community, so that the groups in which the
particular rumors were most prevalent can be directly appealed to. Therefore publicity
outlets used should, [therefore,] include newspapers, group and club
publications, lectures before civic and club groups, radio interviews,
speeches, or programs, pamphlets and posters, school projects, library
displays, discussion group materials, etc. The project might consider
the value of asking editors to contribute space for columns called "Did
You Know That?" Or "Things You Ought to Know," the project providing colorful
and traumatic information designed to answer rumors without specifically
mentioning them.

In addition to the special educational campaigns worked out
on the basis of informational gaps, and continuing information purpose
they rumor control project is to toughen people's minds against rumors.

There are several simple rules the project could help to publicize
as its major campaign. These rules are:

1.  Never repeat a rumor.
2.  Do not repeat a rumor verbally even to deny it.
3.  If you know the facts which can spike a rumor, cite the
facts promptly.
4.  If you do not know the facts which can stop a rumor, ask
the rumor-teller where he got his facts.
5.  Don't give a rumor the benefit of any doubt.
