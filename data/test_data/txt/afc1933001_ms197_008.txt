Dear Duncan,

Now that I'm outside the Library
I can understand why 5->10 yr restrictions
are necessary. It simply takes that
long to get books published at times -
Now how long has your own ballad book been 
around, for instance?

So I reckon Miss Ritchie and I
will have to get on without Library
help. I suppose you'll get the records
in the end anyhow.

Regards
Alan
