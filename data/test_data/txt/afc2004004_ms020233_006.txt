that job.  He had a contract, I reckon.  Yessir.  We jus'...
He was a, he was a, ah, checker an' see about all the hands an'
everything.
TL:  One farmer would hire a bunch of you to come up and pick and
you'd pick until you'd done his whole job, right?
BJ:  Well, they's all them peoples plan[s]ts these things but they
ain't got nobody to gather'm.  You see?  So then they gets in

TL:  It's a special organization.
BJ:  Tha's right.  An' then, an' then the name of that [ag] ajicutchur

see?  But they have to get 'em from the south 'cause the
northern peoples ain't gonna go out, out of the towns, out of

'em.  Just say for an intrance (instance), you git enough in New

ain't goin' to do it, ya see.  So that's it.  So...But they git
'em from the South [to] an' we pick 'em here.
