[*Doesn't want wife's dominance*]
off-a him, y'know. It-it, that's the way I felt [ii] when I come back. I didn' want
nobody tellin'me nothin'. That's why I didn' never stay in the South no more after I
come outta the Army. I come outta the Army in 1919, an'-uh, I couldn' stan' that bossin'
aroun' by nobody. Nobody, you know what I mean, tellin' me wha-what to do an' what I've 
got to do... Don't tell me what I got to do, you know? Well my wife always, before I 
went to the Army, whatsonever she said that went. An' when-after I went in the Army
and came out, well, then she wanted to do the same thing, you know. Tell me that I
shouldn' do this an' I shouldn' do that an'different things. Well, I wouldn' stand for 
that, see? An', same thing[s] about-uh white men down there I had to work fer. They'd 
try to tell me this an' tell me that, an' I didn'-didn' care no m-mo-more 'bout a white
man than I did 'bout a black man, see? An' whensonever he try to tell me somethin'
that I had to do, why, that's wha' we fell out, see? So I jus' lef' from from there an' went
to St. Louis an' stayed there for a while, lef' from there an' come to Chicago. I got to
Chicago in 19-1920 on the eightth day of February. An' I haven' lived in the South since.
Don' expect to live there no more, if I can keep from it.

[*Doesn't want white man's dominance*]
Alan: do you remember anything like that?
BILL: Well I-s-I the main reason that I lef' from home [was] because I couldn' stand the-uh-
-the way that the white man had been treatin' me. I was jus' dumb to a fac; I thought
't was the right way to be treated. An' then when I found out that it was the wrong way
I jus' wouldn' take that no more, see?
