Tradition as a Factor in Cultural Strategy

(Annex to Proposal for the Utilization
during a National Emergency of Materials 
relating to Nationality Groups 
in the United States)

This annex is intended as a development of certain implications in 
the original memorandum for the fuller realization of American cultural 
forces as they affect national unity and their fuller utilization in the 
present national emergency. Described herein are (1) supplement to program 
and (2) supplementary material.

I. Supplement to Program

The proposal for the utilization of nationality materials during the
immediate crisis should be extended to include the utilization of these
and kindred materials in preparation for the inevitable aftermath, which
may prove to be a greater problem than the crisis itself. Underlying this
plan is the conviction that a wise handling of the crisis may be expected
to abate the severity of the aftermath; preparation well in advance for
handling the aftermath [will facilitate] may, to advantage, be woven into the handling of the crisis.

These twin considerations call for organization of (1) a short-term,
high-speed production of the most effective local and traditional material
that at once expresses and evokes the most characteristic reactions of the
common man; (2) a longer-term production of these and like materials expressing
and evoking the deepest-set, most universal potentialities of American
culture.

Such organization would be in keeping with (1) the two-way process
of acculturation in which immigrant minorities and the native American
majority function reciprocally as donor and receiving groups; (2) the
long-term nature of the "Americanization" process itself, extending over
generations; (3) the impossibility of studying immigrant groups without a
corresponding study of the basic and long-range patterns of "native" American life.

In this work the majority group and dominant Anglo-American tradition
should be subjected to the same scrutiny and the same test as the minority
groups and non-Anglo-American traditions. First, the American tradition
must be presented in its positive content and as an active force making
for diversification as against the regimentation of collective social organization.
Secondly, the majority group must be viewed as itself exposed
to splinter-group action from within, induced by chauvinism and jingoism.

The present moment is an suspicious one for undertaking a long-range
study because the swiftness of events and the rapidity of change are shocking
us into a new consciousness of our submerged cultural variations, as
well as bringing into open conflict the strains and tensions, the divisions
and cleavages, latent in our composite ethnic, linguistic, regional and
