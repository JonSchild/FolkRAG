grabber.  We are so poor in resources we
must welcome them all and more.  Luckily
folk - lore is such a vast and teeming sea
that few or many nets can scarce fish
it out.
   On the positive side our work has been
useful or stimulating to educators and
artists.  This seems to me a fairly legitimate
reason for collecting -- to keep the
aesthetic life of our society in a
state of rapid and vigorous circulation - keeping
the top in constant touch with the bottom -
acting as the devil's somewhat apologetic advocate.
(Discuss the aesthetic problem -- what is beautiful folklore?)
A great percentage of folk-lorists have
worked for such ends.  And it can be one
by product of all collecting.  Of course, if this
our aim and limit, we can then be come the gullible
fools of any ideology which comes along and offers
folk-lore a job.
