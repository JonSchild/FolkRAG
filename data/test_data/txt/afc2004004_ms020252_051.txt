Oh, God told Jonah, "Go to Nineveh land, 
"I want you to go there at my command."
But Jonah decided that he wouldn't obey, 
He made up his mind that he would run away.

CHORUS: 
Livin' humble, 
Humble, 
Humble your self, the bell done ring, 
"Shout humble," he said, "The Bell done ring,"
"Cry humble," he said, "The bell done ring,"
"Die humble, " he said, "The bell done ring,"
"Pray humble, " he said, "The bell done ring."

Oh, Jonah walked down [by] 'bout the tidey (?) sho', 
He met up with the ship makin' ready to go, 
He paid his fare, 
He got on boa'd, 
The ship went driftin' on down the sho',
Jonah decided
He would go and hide,
