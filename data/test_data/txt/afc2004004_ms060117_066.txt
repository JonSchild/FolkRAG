Dear Manny,
The contract came several days ago, but I have been on a dead run recording
without time to reply. I went over the document carefully with an excellent
lawyer here who is accustomed to dealing with recording contracts. The suggestions
we came up with do not, I think, run counter to our verbal understanding
In fact a number of the points were apparently introduced from your normal exclusive
artists contract and here are inappropriate.
1) re. para 2... "and less the cost of the album covers.... therein) "
I have never seen this provision in any of my record contracts and I am sure you
did not intend for me to pay for the album jackets.
para 2, second line page two... My lawyer suggested that this be amended
to read "either by Vanguard or by other persons"...
2) Para 3... I am not accustomed to this book club clause. And, without
quite understanding the matter, I do not see that I should agree for all my
subordinate artists to having freebies and thus no royalties on a large number
of records. Perhaps you could reassure me on this point.
3) Para . 4...I cannot accept, nor did you wish I am sure to have me as an
exclusive artist. My aim is to publish as many records with as many companies
as possible, in order to get the rich stuff around.
4) Para 10... I would like this amended so that such assignment might be
"by mutual consent." In this connexion you will recall that we discussed the problem
of discontinuance of publication. Since these lps are important scientific and
cultural documents, I would like your attorney to provide a way for me to pass
the masters on to someone else, in case you decide that they are no longer
publishable by you. This is what book publishers do about out of print books----
the rights revert to the author and he may take them elsewhere. Phrase this how
you like, but please get it into the contract. I would of course prefer a ten
year lease arrangment, as I have with CRC.
