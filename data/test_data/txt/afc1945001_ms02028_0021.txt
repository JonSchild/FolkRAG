"I talked to an officer friends of mine home on furlough and he said
if you are a business man to avoid going in as a buck private if you have to commit
suicide to do it because the army figures they will really ride the successful business 
men who come in.  Had one whole troop of former business men who spent six 
months sorting garbage.  Army figures the businessmen are the ones who were keeping
down their appropriations all the time they were making big money and they're going 
to get even with them."  Des Moines business man in age likely to be draftable if
dependency requirements are relaxed.  8-3-42.

"Understand ________ company was sent across without him."  Blank name 
is prominent Des Moines business man reported as "broke" by the army.  Business man.

"The judge told me _________ is home without his uniform because he couldn't 
leave the women and drink along."  Another prominent Des Moines business man. Reported 
by a lawyer on 8-6-42.  The story about these two men has been repeated by at least 
a dozen persons in our hearing.  Both of them were former national guardsmen.

"You have to have a pull in the army to get a commission."  Business man 
about to be drafted.  8-5-42.

"My friend has a son in the service and she hasn't heard from him and he 
hasn't heard from her for months, and none of her letters are returned.  They just 
don't get the mail to the boys at all."  Mother of man in service.  8-5-42.

We talked to the Army Recruiting Officer who told us they had concluded 
this was a subversive program because they had had recent incidents of anonymous 
letters written to parents of men in service that there would be no mail between 
the men and their parents for several months but "not to worry".
