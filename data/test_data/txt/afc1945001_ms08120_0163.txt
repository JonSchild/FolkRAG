Jokes: "I say, waiter, is this peach or apple pie?"
"Can't you tell by the taste?"
"No." "Then what difference does it make?"
"Ladies and gentlemen," said the after-dinner speaker, 
"before I begin my address I have something 
that I want to say to you."
Waiter: "Did you say you wanted your eggs
turned over, sir?"
