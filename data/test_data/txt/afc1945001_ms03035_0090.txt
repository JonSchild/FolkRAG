Rumor: Speaker at Dearborn Exchange Club related experiences at Sault St. Marie,
and stated that Negro soldiers were conducting themselves so that local
enforcement officers, county sheriff's department and state police were
unable to cope with situation and appeals had been made direct to 
Washington for assistance.  Specific actions included holding up of a 
white couple by two negro soldiers and raping of the woman by both
Negroes, who later were apprehended and tried.  Nightly slashings and
cuttings of other Negroes supposedly were common occurrences, one such
slashing being so severe that white nurse who attended the physician,
and who had been practicing for 18 years, fainted.  Negro soldiers cross 
over to Canada, where they tell the girls there that they are South
American Indians, and have become so opular that white soldiers are
unable to obtain dates.  This last rumor, if true, appears to me to be
rather innocuous.
