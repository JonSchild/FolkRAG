TAPE 99. BARROWSON-HUMBER PLOUGH PLAY SONG:
1) It was early one morning at the break of the day
The cocks were all crowing -- the farmer did say,
"Come rise, my young fellows, come rise with good will,
Your horses want something, their bellies to fill."
2) When four o'clock comes and out we do run,
And into the stables so merrily fly,
With brushing and scrubbing our horses I'll vow
We're all jolly fellows that follow the plough.
3) When six o'clock comes, our breakfast we need,
With beef, bread and all, boys, we heartily eat,
With a piece in ourpocket I'll swear and I'll vow,
We're all jolly fellows that follow the plough.
4) We harness our horses and away we do go,
And straight o'er the hillside as merry as the crow,
And shout to each other so hearty and bold,
To see which of us has straight furrowed our road.
