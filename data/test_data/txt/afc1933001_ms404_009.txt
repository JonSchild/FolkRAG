Uncle Bob Ledbetter, uncle of Huddie, enjoyed his automobile trip away from his farm home where he lived with his granddaughter and her family of husband and nine children
He wave at all his friends along the road. he didn't know how old hewwas; he believed his father told him on December 18, 1880- he thought was the year- that he was nineteen years old that day.. His father had thirteen children. We took his to Oil city, La., where his grandson,Noah,joined us for recordings in our small hotel room. . About seven o'clock in the evening Mr. L.Brought up a bottle of milk, a sandwich and cake for Uncle Bob. One of the first things he said when he returned home was: "They sure showed me a good time; that was the first time I ever ate at a white people's hotel in my life."
Uncle Bob told all about the lakes and ferries of the old days. "Lots o' good fishing", he said, "but I don't like to fish Don't like anything about the water. the biggest motion I can make in the water is to go to the bottom."
In half apology for Huddie's troublous career, he remarked: "Looks like some people's born for trouble; jes' loves trouble.  . " Again: "I tells you how it is wid de nigger nation. Ef a man goes big wid de women, us mens hates him!"

As he drank a small amount of today, he quoted this rhyme, which he said he hadn't thought of for many years- "since I don't know when":
Too much for one,
Not enough for two;
So I'll drink what's in the glass,
And leave the rest for you.                                                R.T.L.
