Tape:  #224 Sacred Harp   p. 8

(MR)  389. . .
MRS:  The numbers won't mean as much unless you can tell the words of
the song.  what is that, 318, isn't that, "We thank the Lord. . ."
MR:  That's right, the words on 318 is, "We thank the Lord of Heaven
and Earth/ Who has preserved us from our birth/ our present
joys for blessings past/ and for the hope of Heaven at last"
MRS:  That is a reall pretty song when the bass picks up and then
the alto. . . .
