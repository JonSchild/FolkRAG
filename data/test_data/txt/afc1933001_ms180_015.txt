Washington, D. C.

Dear Dr. Lomax:
     Mr. Vance Randolph has been in this region collecting
folk songs for the Library of Congress. The Arkansas Gazette has
asked me to prepare an article on his work here.
     Mr. Randolph has given me some very helpful information,
but he suggests that I come to you with the following questions:
     How many people are engaged in collecting and recording 
folk songs for the Library of Congress in this present enterprise?
Are they all men? How are they selected?
     What districts are being covered? Such as the Ozarks,
Midwest, Appalachians and so on.
     How long has this work been going on? When is it
expected to be completed?
     Whose idea was it and how is it sponsored? That is,
is it conducted as a government project under some federal agency,
or by a system of grants from the Library of Congress? Or otherwise?
     Have you any notion how many items should be recorded
before the completion of the work, and do you know how many Child
ballads have so far been recorded by the collectors in the present 
project?
     I would greatly appreciate this an any other information
you can give me. Please tell me anything you will that is 
relevant. Thank you very much.
     Would you like clip sheets of the story when it
appears?

Very truly yours,
