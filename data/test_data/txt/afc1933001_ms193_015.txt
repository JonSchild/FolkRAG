Pvt. Alan Lomax, #2

We understand that wire machines are at last beginning to be sufficiently
good to warrant serious consideration but the Archive itself 
is not anticipating acquiring any until they are thoroughly perfected.  
Someone in the office the other day told me that the Lear Manufacturing 
Company of Los Angeles (possibly Chicago) is producing one which will 
sell for less than $100. You might check into this since it seems to be 
a good buy and the advantages of a wire recording machine are obvious to 
you. I should like to own one myself and as they come along, I shall be
in the market too.
   
When you hear from the Guggenheim and your chances there should 
be good, you will probably have more definite projects in mind even than 
those that you are thinking out at the moment. As these become clearer, 
the Archive would, of course, be glad to make available a Presto and 
discs. You know the routine here of justifying projects and in order that 
we could do that, we would want the same type of specific outline which 
you had to have from collectors.
   
The whole thing should work out well and tie in with your Guggenheim 
work.
    
Thank you for your note about your father's letter which to say the 
least set me back on my heels a bit. I had thought of answering it once 
but a hasty reply would have gotten us nowhere and I feel that the best 
thing is to forget it.
              
With best wishes,
