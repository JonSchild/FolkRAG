How [many] much beauty has the sun
[To] No one can look at it -
He, who looks at, has an
emotion so great that he 
closes and begins to weep

The say with the jaw's harp. Diego
dosn't understand & [La Nota]

The mother is before the
sepulcher of the Lord, telling
of the passion - La Nota

Nina Nandy [Nwelica]
Little one, yr mother has no heart
[But] Por you have them both -
Son of mine, close yr little eyes
So [the] sleep can come -
Sleep has left his home &
comes to go ride  Has come
from [???iner] - Sleep has send
the king & the queen -- has sent them
to the sound of the violin

[*He had a 
Webster inside
the truck
and only mouthed
the words*]
