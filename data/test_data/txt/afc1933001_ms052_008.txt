as we did in Washington
Italy is only 20 miles away
Monte Carlo five miles, the
sea at our door and
the alps looming up to
the edge of the Mediterranean
along which roads are 
out. We gawked at the
Carnival at Nice (4
miles distant) and paraded
the Promenade
L'Anglaise along with
the notables of the world.
Three doors down the
street vsits Anthony
Eden, here for a rest
from the political storms

of England. Washington
seems far away, and
Texas about disappears from
my mental horizon.
Please give [m] my love
to Mrs. Watson and remember
us most kindly
to all of our Library
friends. Maybe sometime
I'll try to drag
out a note to [?Spivacke].
Again my warm
thanks to you for a thousand
favors.
Yours always,
John [?A]. Lomax
