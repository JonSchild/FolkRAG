BARTONSVILLE, VERMONT.

Ray F. Stevens,
R.F.D.  The Flying Cloud was as fine a ship
As ever sailed the main,

Brenan on the Moor

Doris Blandin.  The Butcher Boy
The Silver Dagger
A Paper of Pins

Gladys Bradley   Fair Charlotte lived on a mountain side
Twas on a Sunday morning
When young William arose
Straightway to the chamber of Gabriel he goes.

Sons of freedom, listen to me
An ye daughters too, give ear,
A sad and mournful story ever told
