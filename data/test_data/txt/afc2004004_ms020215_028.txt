THROW ME ANYWHERE, LORD (IN THAT OLD FIELD)
The Buzzard Lope

CHORUS:     Throw me anywhere, Lord,     (
                      In that old field,                        (     (2)
                      Don't care how you do me,     (
                      In that old field,
                      Since King Jesus choose me,
REFRAIN:      In that old field.

You may beat and bang me, (REFRAIN)
Since King Jesus save me,      (REFRAIN)     (CHORUS)

Don't care how you treat me, (REFRAIN)
Since King Jesus meet me, (REFRAIN)          (CHORUS)
