                        Dear Harold, 
                                 I received your distressful note this morning and feel sorry
                         that I have been so busy. Your notes about the Lead Belly
                        records certainly delighted me, and, since there is so little
                        to my credit these days, I might at least take what's rightfully
                        mine-- I did send you the records.
                               Father has unwritten me several encouraging notes about his 
                        work lately. I enclose the last one. I am writing him this
                       afternoon to persuade him to investigate one Robert Johnson
                       of Robinsville, Mississippi, on whom Hammond and I are going to 
                       do an album soon. Hammond was much delighted by the plans I
                       submitted to him for reediting their old commercials and I think
                       a contract for me will emerge out of this in the next couple
                       of weeks. 
                               In the meantime, however, I want to come to Washington and 
                       begin work on the Ballad Book. Number II, which I am anxious
                       to get done before the Halpert, Botkin Seeger, etc. group even
                       begin theirs. I am, however, so broke that I wonder whether I
                       can even get out of town. What has been heard from the revered 
                       and highly learned committee on the subject of my grant? I am
                       already, by the by, working full time for the Library again and
                       I thus expect to be able to adjust my leave during June equab-
                       ly. ... The Writer's Congress has asked me to speak on the sub-
                      ject of folk-lore on June the Fourth. Shall I stay on
