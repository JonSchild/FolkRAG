MY BIG UNION SMILE
Tune--My Wild Irish Rose.
If you listen I'll sing you a quaint little song,
Of a joy that creeps over my soul.
In the fight for a square deal against every wrong,
As we struggle to capture our goal.
We smile in the night, we smile as we fight,
We smile 'cause we know we are right.
It helps to be the game and it's surely worth while,
So I put on my big Union smile.

Chorus--
My big Union smile, the latest thing in style,
You may search everywhere, but none can compare,
With my big Union smile.
My big Union smile will fit a crocodile,
So throw 'way your frown,
While we knock Wall Street down,
With the power of our big Union smile.

If you smile when I smile then another will smile,
And our courage grow bigger each day,
For a soul that can smile for a cause that's worth while
Has a right to be happy and gay.
We smile when we're down, we smile when folks frown,
We'll smile 'til the victory is found.
A rainbow will come after rain fall and storm,
So smile away every alarm.

HAVE PATIENCE
Tune--Wait Till the Sun Shines, Nellie, Bye and Bye.
Wait till we stop that gambling
In our corn and wheat and rye,
We will be happy, brethren, don't you sigh.
Down prosperous lane we'll wander, Reuben, You and I.
Wait till we stop that gambling bye and bye.

Wait till we sell out livestock,
Through co-operative hands.
We will get cost prices, brethren, right demands,
We'll pay our debts and mortgage, Reuben, You and i.
Wait till we sell our livestock, bye and bye.
