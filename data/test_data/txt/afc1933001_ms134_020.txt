June 6, 1938.

Mr. John Hammond,
178 Sullivan St
New York City

Dear Mr. Hammond:

Your name has come into conversations with friends
here in Washington so often that I feel that we had
already been formally introduced. It seems possible, 
therefore, for me to ask you a few questions without 
more ado. 

For the past couple of weeks I have been recording the
piano technique of Jelly Roll Morton, and along with
his blues and rag-time compositions, a great deal of
autobiographical material for the Archive of American
Folk Song at the Library of Congress.

I am, however, a rather raw amateur when it comes to
swing and hot jazz, and after having read "Down Beat"
and Panassie and the rest I still am somewhat at a 
loss to place Jelly Roll in his proper category. He,
himself, is extremely bitter because of the neglect he
has suffered for a number of years and tends to run down
other musicians and boast of his own achievements more
than is fair to either, I suspect. I would very much
like an objective opinion from you as to his real abi-
lity as composer, arranger and performer of hot jazz
and swing, in relation to the other great names of those
styles.

The Archive of American Folk Song now has some two thou-
sand spot recordings of American folk music and I look
forward to the time when you will be able to come to
Washington and spend some time listening to this
material.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Asst. in Charge of Archive of
American Folk Song
