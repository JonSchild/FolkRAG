Mrs. T. M. Bryant,
1109 E. Gun Street,
Evansville, Indiana.

Dear Mrs. Bryant:

Elizabeth and I were delighted to hear from you again and to know that you and your family were well and that you were continuing to discover new songs. I will certainly insist that Mr. Brewster send me copies of all the new songs that you recall.

As for the pictures, we have not seen them ourselves yet, but as soon as they are developed and printed we will send you copies of the best ones.

With very best regards to you and your hospitablae family, I am

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
