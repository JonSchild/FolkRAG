My, didn't it rain!  my, didn't it rain! 
The ark it sailed clear out of sight,
My, didn't it rain!

When Moses went at God's command, to call Pharaoh, 
The king of Egypt said, I'll never let the people go
To hold a harum scarum camp out in the wilderness,
To propagate their doctrine of a so-called holiness.
But Moses said to Aaron, Let's magnify our God, 
He stepped out on the river bank and raise aloft his
rod. 

CHORUS 

My didn't it rain!  my, didn't it rain! 
The locusts, frogs, and lice, and flies, 
Came tumbling down out of blacken'd skies.
My, didn't it rain!  my, didn't it rain! 
It made old Pharoah bat his eyes,
My, didn't it rain!

When Ahab reigned in Israel, back in the long ago,
The drought was on, they'd had no rain for forty
months or so, 
Old Ahab bent to eat and drink, Elijah went to pray,
His servant said, There is no use, don't fool your time
away; 
But soon a small sized cloud was seen in less than
half an hour, 
Said Elijah, Get your parasols, we're going to have
a shower. 

CHORUS 

My, didn't it rain!  my, didn't it rain! 
The sky grew black, the storm it broke,
