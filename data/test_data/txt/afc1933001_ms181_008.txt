Newton Highlands, Mass.

Dear Mr. Brackett:

A checklist of about 12,000 items in the 
Archives is about to be published and we
shall be glad to send you one should you
wish it. However, if you would let me 
know what type of songs you are interested
in, I would be glad to make a representative
selection for you and to send you an estimate 
of their cost.

The records which may be obtained through the 
Archive of American Folk Song are 12-inch,
double sided acetate disks which cost $1.75
each. (This price is subject to change
without notice because of the changing costs
of materials.)

I trust this information will be of assistance
to you.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge
Archive of American Folk Song
