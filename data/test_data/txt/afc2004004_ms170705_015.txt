The Black Country Interview.
I mean everybody in the country wishes it was morning, but
they don't seem to trouble about that here -- they've just
got their minds on other things. It don't make 'em no worse,
you know, it don't make 'em no wuss. But I'll say, rough and 
ready, none of the niceties as they've got in the country. Not
so polite. It be a different type of man I reckon myself, when
he used to make his own amusement. I think now, they just go
to work and they come out at night. They got nothing to occupy
their time. They just go back to work; they do that all the 
week. When it come Saturday, they all knock off work, and they
all rush to the  train or the charabanc and off to the football
match, and all come back and that's it. They've lost all interest
in such livestock and that. That used to provide a big interest,
I reckon, for the Black Country. We always kept bull terriers
and a cock or two -- occasionally a pigeon or two we had.
Today, they all seem more to one pattern. They were like more
individual then. . . . .
