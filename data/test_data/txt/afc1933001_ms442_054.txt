Dicklicker's Holler

"Dicklicker was an ol' nigger I was in jail with in [Shreve]
[Sk] Texas, Don' know where he come f'[o]um or what become of him, 
but, man that nigger could sing. We'd be lying up in de 
bull-pen* an' Dicklicker would holler this ol' song. He didn'
care, [N]nawsuh, he didn' care about nothin' an' nobody. Settin'
there in jail he [kep] jus' kep' [on] a-holl'in' this ol' song."
[(Note, insert after music)]
We have no doubt that the melody is of white origin, adapted
to [fit] the [blues pattern] Negro manner. The second, [and] third, fourteenth and fifteenth [verses] stanzas are
Dicklicker's. Many of the others L.B. [composed] improvised while he
was [think] singing into the microphone, and in these he was often more
interested in making a rhyme than in making sense. At times
he inserts a series of verses from Billy the Weaver. [which
he also learned from Dicklicker.] This holler is a jailhouse
blues and no mistake, the jailhouse, where the figures of women walk through the
the thoughts of the men by day and by night.

I been down here rollin' for white man so long,
I'm a po[o]'r boy an' (a) long ol' ways f'om home.

But some day or 'nother I'll be done [worryin'] worryin' here,
I'll be somewhere, some girl will feel my care.

If I ever live an' am goin' free once [mo] mo',
I'm gonna write a letto', gal, an' let you know.

I'm gon' tell you sumpin, I swear , gal, I [decalre] declare,
I'm gonna tell the worl', there mus' be a God somewhere.

'Cause when I lef' you, woman, I lef' you col' in han',
was gonna be gone so long, I'[se] afraid you'd get a bran' new man.
