Got the Fort[h] Worth blues an' the Dallis heart disease,
Got the Fort Worth [B] blues an' the Dallis heart disease,
Cain' keep my woman, Lord from worr'in' me.

Cain' lay down for dreamin' an' I jus' cain' sleep for cryin',
Cain' laydwon for dream', [Ju]  jus' cain' sleep for cryin',
I jus' cain wear dat black woman offa my min'.

If I don' crazy, hon', I8ll go stone blin',
If I don' go crazy, hon', I'll go stone blin',
'Cause that black woman, she sho do worry my min'.
First time I met her she's holdin' out her hand,
First time I met her, she's holdin' out her hand,
When I give her my money, she give it to her bran' nwe man.

Got de Fort Worth blues an' de Dall[a]is heart disease,
Got de Fort Worth blues an' de Dallis heart disease,
Can't help a-thinkin', "Do that woman love me?"

Baby, I'm so glad, hon' that I can see,
Baby, I'm so glad, hon' that I can see,
[Baby] Oh, you can' make [t] no fat-mouf outa me.

[If y] They want me, woman, to be like Jesse James,
They want me, gal, to be like Jesse James,
Take two six-shooters an' rob some pass'nger train.

If you want me, woman, to do like Jesse James,
If you want me, woman, to be like Jesse James,
Well's to pack your suitcase an' fin' you a bran' new man.
