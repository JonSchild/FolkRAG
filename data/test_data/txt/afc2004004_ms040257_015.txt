Mr. Macphee:
You hear your own language, you listen to your language, 
and you feel at home more than in another place.
Mrs. Nicolson:
My father's name was Peter Campbell. My mother was
Kate Campbell...There were seven children.....I was at school
till I was fourteen.....I am a widow for the last eight years
and I live with my brother-in-law. I help him on the farm...
keep house for him, and look after the cows and calves, and
I've an adopted daughter, my brother's girl......I just work,
I keep house for him.
Mrs. McCormick:
I've been living there 17 years now......I've no family...
...yes, a croft....it's only a small croft....7 acres....no,
we don't keep calves...we just have got one cow...yes, chickens
and hens and ducks.....well, I like it all right but I would
prefer being in Oban than in Uist.....Yes, because I've been
there nearly all the days of my life......from old people that
used to stay near us. They used to sing old songs...they were
bery old. I'm sure they would be over a hundred years now....
His name was Alexander Morrison....
Mr. McLeod:
I've been born and brought up here, except for a few periods
away to the mainland...though we like that for a spell, we
always want to come back"to smell the tangle of the isles"
perhaps. My main job, I think, is to keep Penny Morrison and
Mrs. Nicholson awake singing songs will two in the morning.
Apart from that I work in a croft, doing all sorts of odd jobs...
...the usual chores that have to be done in the Western Isles -
peat cutting and sea-weeding and ploughing and cutting corn and
hay..........The mouth music....I learned it from an old woman,
Mrs. Macphee, Mrs. McLennan's mother. And I could have had
hundreds of them, if I'd been careful.
