From Margery C. Quigley, Montclair, New Jersey
Heard in Montclair, New Jersey, August 10, 1942
Subject: SUMARINE MENACE

Conversation between a librarian and the proprietor of a
gift shop:

Librarian: Libraries think they have their finger on the pulse
of the public. I imagine however that the proprietor
of a gift shop hears all sorts of news and confidences--
even more personal than in a library.
Proprietor: And how! You can't imagine some of the things I hear.
Librarian: What, for instance?
Proprietor: Well today I heard from a woman who had been at a summer
cottage on the coast that we had no idea how thick the
submarines are in coastal waters. Where she was the owners
of small boats were not allowed to go out at all. The woman said, "I suppose
I have no business giving away the government's secrets." The government
agents had actually told her neighbors who owned boats they
could not go out.
