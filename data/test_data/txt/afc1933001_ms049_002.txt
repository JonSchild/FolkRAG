Dear Mr. Lomax:

We have been informed that it is possible to obtain dialect recordings from you. 

Would you please send us a list, by return, of your records, both English and American, with prices. We are particularly anxious to obtain a recording of negro dialect as soon as possible. 

Thanking you, I am,
Yours very truly,
Sheila Marryat
Radio Secretary,
