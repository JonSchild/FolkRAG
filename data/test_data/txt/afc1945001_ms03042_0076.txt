-2- Rumors, 8-9 to 8-15    New York    8-18-42

New York 8-12 (Irish-American): "Just let me see any English fighting when Americans are there to do it. Even in Egypt we have replaced the British -- us and the Australians."
Buffalo 8-10 (Irish-American): "Roosevelt has been duped by the British. They sent over their bastard, tongue-tied King didn't they? And Roosevelt fell all over him, didn't he? Why? Because they did it with mirrors. They made Roosevelt think he is a god and now they're making us pay for the promises he made. To hell with the British, I say -- we've got enough to take care of here in America."
Hoosick Falls 8-11 (Jewish tailor): "It is the Britishers who hold up the second front. They don't want Russia strong. They want to hold on to their silk hats and dividends. They are even stalling about sending supplies to Russia."
New York 8-9 (School teacher): "The British are so conservative that they won't let our Army invade the Continent.."
New York 8-12 (Italian-American barber): "Who pays for all the British stuff? We do. We pay for what is made here and sent to England. We pay for everything that our soldiers get in England. They don't give us nothing, not one cent's worth. They will make money on this war."
New York 8-13: "England is asleep at the switch, or just plain afraid. Where is that second front?"
New York 8-12 (Minister): "I have reason to believe the British and our forces have accumulated so many planes in England that in ten days they will be able to wipe out every important city in Nazi Germany. Mark my words, they'll do it before snow flies."
New York 8-14 (Negro lawyer): "Every day we see new proofs that this 'United Nations democracy' is not for all races. Now the British are striking down the brown men of India."
