Dear Mr. Lomax,
I did not intend to disband our apartment and
leave Washington without seeing you again, but friends swooped 
me off in an open car to go by boat to Norfolk and then
return vis Williamsburg, Charlottesville and the Sky Line
Drive, just in time to gather up everything and leave.
Since then I’ve endured a grippy cold.
Just when I think we have a clear understanding about
material you recorded through my introductions, but of which I
took earlier mechanical records, you do not act upon your
given word to me, to consult me about its uses.  I have a 
dictaphone recording of Elmer George’s “Jack Monroe” on 
cylinder 119, taken in October of 1934.  It is now the property
of Middlebury College. Certainly their permission should be
asked if its inclusion in a radio-presentation album, is under
way.  The listing of records in the Vermont Archive must be
available to you at the Library of Congress. I have but to refer to
page 245 of the PROCEEDINGS of the Vermont Historical Society
of June 1940 to read what Dictaphone records were made from
the singing of Elmer George.  Please have such a copy handy,
as well as the September 1940 issue which lists your own
fine work in Vermont with stars where I had previously made
collection of the same item.
Please address your reply to me at Hotel Shelburne,
Atlantic City, where 
I shall be probably by the time you will be writing.
Sincerely yours,
Helen Hartness Flanders
