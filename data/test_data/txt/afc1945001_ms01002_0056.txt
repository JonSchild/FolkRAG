My dear Mr. Dubois: 

Supplementing my letter to you of 
February 25th, I am now forwarding to you 
another letter received from Mr. Gregory 
V. Drumm, dealing with the prevention of 
the spread of rumors. 

I am again writing Mr. Drumm, as 
per the copy attached, advising him of this 
reference. 

Very truly yours, 
[*William L Langer*]
