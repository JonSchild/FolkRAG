Subject : Definition of Rumor

I agree that it is wise for purposes of the Bureau's study to make the
definition of rumor broad so as to include general expressions of unprompted
opinion on war related topics. But it seems to me that there is a
difference not only in essential nature but also in presumable
treatment between the statement:
            "The Russians are scoundrels and double-crossers."
and the statement
            "The Russians are at present negotiating with Germany through Stockholm 
for a separate peace at our expense."
            Both are presented as facts; but, the first
is that general sort of fact indistinguishable from opinion, and
the second is the specific sort of fact usually cited as evidence for an
opinion. In classifying rumor it seems to me a distinction worth
preserving.
