P.S. if you should come this 
way again Alan please drop me 
a card before you even get into 
Ark and I will quit whatever 
I am doing at the time and start 
home and wait there. Would love 
spending some time with you. 

think we can do some real work on balods [balads]

so will say thanks again and 
love.
