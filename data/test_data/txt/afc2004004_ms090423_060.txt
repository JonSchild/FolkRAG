103. 

don't know no work song other than "I been working on 
the railroad all the live long day". When it comes to 
the blues, I just don't like them unless its something 
like the St. Louis

There's one little old song I doubt if you know that 
kids around here sing when they is playing nothing special. 

Oh, the bull dog on the bank 
Told the bull frog in the pond 
You big old water fool 
Singing tra, la, la, la  

That's really pretty when harmonized. 

Yes, I think dancing is all right in the proper place 
and at the proper time - like at socials. I don't got 
much use for no night clubs like other boys and girls 
around here that go to "Paradise Hall". 

When it comes to what I want sung at my funeral, I 
haven't thought nothing about it, but one of my favorite 
songs is, "Oh Precious Lord", and I think that would be 
appropriate for the occasion. Like I told you, I don't 
think there's no songs that's just out and out wrong to 
sing but there's a time and place for everything. 

(Which do you prefer, Negro or white music and why?)
Negro all the time. Well, because it's a gift that 
seemingly no other race has, and I think that every man 
should praise the ground he stands on. If you have the 
gift, you should praise the best.
