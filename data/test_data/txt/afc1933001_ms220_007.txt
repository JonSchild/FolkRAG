mas presents, he has always spoken
of you as if you might be
his [soon] son. He and Mrs.
Winterbotham met me at the
train - although he staggered as
he walked. He is a broken, almost
helpless, old man, and has not
been to his offices for years.

As he said goodbye he asked
me with a tremor in his voice,
"wont you please tell Alan
that I'd enjoy a letter from
him?" And I promised to
be the bearer of this message.
You'd better not wait long.

Lovingly,

Father
