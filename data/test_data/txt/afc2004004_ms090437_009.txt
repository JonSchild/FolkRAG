On time I asked my daddy to play the fiddle.  He say,
"If you want to play the fiddle, whyn't you play
it yourself."  [I went] He bust me over the head.  I
went off & stayed six months, I came back.  The
old man say "go down & watch them hogs, they down
in the lot."  " They ain't down in the lot."  "They must
be in the cornfield"  Call yo hounds (sound on fiddle)
