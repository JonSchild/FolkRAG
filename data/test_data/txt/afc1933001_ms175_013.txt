Mrs. Ruby Pickens Tartt 
Livingston 
Alabama 

Dear Mrs. Tartt: 

You will be pleased to learn, I am sure, that 
your field work in Alabama to be undertaken in collaboration 
with John A. Lomax has been approved. We are shipping a 
recording machine to Mr. . John Lomax who will bring it to you 
and instruct you in its use. You will of course continue t 
keep in touch with Mr. Alan Lomax regarding the details of your 
work. 

The budget for this project includes $300 as 
reimbursement to you for two months services in recording 
for the Library of Congress. In this connection, let me 
point out that the Library cannot pay in advance for 
personal services. If you desire, however, we can arrange 
to pay this amount in equal monthly installments of $150 each. 
Please let me know your preference in this matter. 

We appreciate your interest in our Archive of 
American Folk-Song and are pleased that we can cooperate 
in this manner.  I look forward to the pleasure of listening 
to your recordings when they arrive. 
Very sincerely yours, 

Harold Spivacke 
Chief, Division of Music
