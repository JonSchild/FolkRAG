Dear Mr. Clarke:

    I was quite disappointed to hear that it proved impractical
to include some of our records in your music set but I want to
thank you and Mr. Miller for your cooperation and kind interest
in our work. Alan Lomax chose the records to take to New York
and I had no opportunity to hear them. I know that we do have
many records with a minimum of surface noise - some of our
acetate records being quieter than the usual commercial products.

    I think that we can work out a plan for including some of
these records in the music set without involving any commercial
manufacturer but I should like to talk this over with you first.
It is possible that I shall be in New York again very soon and
I hope that we may meet then.

    Sincerely yours,
    
    Acting-Chief,
    Division of Music
