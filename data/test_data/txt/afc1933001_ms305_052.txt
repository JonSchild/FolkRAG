66 Songs Covering 
All Areas of U. S. 
By GLENN DILLARD GUNN 
     The new U. S. Army is to be 
a democratic institution - at 
least insofar as its songs are 
concerned. 
     The General Staff has said so. 
Service Men Polled 
     While Leopold Stokowski was 
revamping the military band, 
and Alan Lomox was singing old 
American folk songs for the 
Generals at the White House, 
the staff took a poll of regulars 
and draftees to discover 
just what the soldiers wanted 
to sing. 
     What resulted is a new Army 
song book. It contains 66 songs 
which reflect the lyric habits 
of every section of the country 
and some of its island possessions. 
     They sketch the nation's history. 
There are songs of 1776 
and 1861, and many of 1914-18. 
There are songs from the wheat 
fields and the cotton fields, 
from railway labor camps, and 
from the cattle country. There 
are songs of the Infantry, the 
Artillery, the Air Corps, the 
Engineers, the Marines, and the 
Navy, few of which are known 
outside the Services. 
Only One German Tune 
     There are songs of Scottish, 
English and Irish origin. Strange 
to tell, there is only one German 
tune in the lot. There are 
only three of Stephen Foster's 
songs, and "Jeannie With the 
Light Brown Hair" is not one 
of them. There is one Negro 
spiritual. 
     A certain amount of editing 
seems probable. "Mad'moiselle 
of Armentiers" is missing, 
though "You're in the Army 
Now" has been retained. That 
most popular of World War 
songs, "Over There," has been 
left out, possibly out of deference 
to the feelings of the isolationists, 
but "Where Do We Go 
From Here?" has been included. 
      A great many of the songs 
chosen by the soldiers have 
been composed by members of 
ASCAP. None derives from the 
catalogue of BMI. That's going 
to be an embarrassment for 
the radio chains unless they 
obey the Department of Justice 
and make peace with ASCAP. 
As matters stand now they won't
