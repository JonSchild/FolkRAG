DALLAS, TEXAS

as long as I live 50% of the rights
of American Ballads and Folk
Songs, 50% of Negro Folk Songs as 
Sung by Lead Belly, 33 1/3 of
Our Singing Country. All of 
which is open to discussion
by you, as I think you
know well. You'd better save 
this letter.

Also, especially since all
the books are copyrighted in
my name to save trouble, time, probably
considerable money, and to relieve
you from embarrassment, I shall
handle all applications for use
of material, dividing the receipts as
I have indicated. [Sincerely]
Lovingly, Father
