Port Aransas, Texas,
3/28/1939.

Dear Harold: Notice of the shipment of the machine came this morning. Thank you sincerely.

Also a special air mail from Dornbush asking that a decision be made this week  I've done my best, as the carbon copies of correspondence will show. His letter raises several new points which may be impossible to solve in so short a time. I am sending to Dornbush the original letter to me from Broome of San Angelo.

Yours in great haste,
Lomax
