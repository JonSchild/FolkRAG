Walter Brown   Tape  3, Side 2 

AL:Now we talked about your father a little bit.  Let's talk about your Ma.
WB:Now my mother was a quiet, Christian person.  I never saw here take a drink of 
nothing and I never saw her drunk.  She never used no bad language with us in raising
us.  She always was calm and when she told you to do something she meant that. 
AL:What if you didn't do it?
WB:If you didn't do it, then she'd whup you.  And she didn't beat you to death;  she
whupped you.  The worst whipping that my mother give me.  .  .  There was a man named
Joe Ross and which about 15 years later, he was my stepfather; after my father got killed
she married him.  He had a pistol--a 32-20--and he take it to his house and he put it 
between the quilt, instead of the two sheets on this bed.  And he went to his house and
he looked for it, but every time he would turn the quilt back, he would turn the pistol back. 
And he said that I had stole it.  He went to the house, he told my mother.  All of them
called me Son.  He said,"Son.  You done stole my pistol."
AL:Now why did he think you'd stolen it?
WB:Well somebody told him that they thought that they had seen me leave his house. 
Well I had been in his yard to the pump and got a drink of water.  Mama put me in a sack and 
tied the sack up and hung me up and whupped me.  That was the worst whipping she ever,
every gave me.
AL:And what did she whip you with?
WB:She whip me with a strap and a stick.  I wouldn't say a switch--a stick.  But she really
beat me.
AL:How long did she beat you?
WB:Oh, she beat me about five or six minutes.
AL:How big were you then?
WB:I was 19 years old.  She said,"Son;"  I said,"M'am;"  and she said,"Go get the pistol."
I said, "Mother.  .  ."
AL:How could she get you in a sack?
WB:Well I never resisted her.  I never resisted my mother.  I never even scuffled with
here.  If she called me I just stood there while she did whatever she was gonna do.
