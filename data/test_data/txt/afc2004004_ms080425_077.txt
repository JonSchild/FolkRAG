(MR)
on a conversation for a long time about the friends
we have from the singin's. We like to meet, you see
'em this Sunday and next Sunday it's like you haven't
seen 'em in two or three months, you're just glad
to see 'em. . . 

MRS:
If we miss a Sunday we get anxious to goin' to another
singin'. . . It seems like it's been a month since we've
been to one.

MR: 
We went to Tuscaloosa, Alabama last Sunday to a singin'.
That was our first trip to Tuscaloosa, to a singin'.
But you always find good people wherever you go to
and there's always a friend. . .

AL:
You've been here in this part of the country for a long
time, your family's been here.

MR:
Yessir, all my life.

AL:
What was their origin?

MR:
My forefathers came from the country of Wales,. . .
England. . .They came to South Carolina, they came from
South Carolina into Georgia. My great-grandfather
fought in the Civil War. He lived near Carrolton,
Georgia. My father was born near Carrolton, and he
moved out to Heard County in 1889, within a mile from 
where we are now. I was born in less than a mile from
here, and my wife was born less than 2 miles from here,
we were born a little over a mile apart. She grew up
in Carrolton, and that's where I met her. . . and when
we got married I brought her back to Heard County!
She's been here ever since, so she's a native of Heard
