BJ TAPE 20, p. 46

TL:       A  [tub] commode is what? A toilet?
BJ:       That's right, I didn't have none.   But I would, ah, take my 
clo'es out in a tub.   Put water in a tub. Wrinch (rinse) 'em 
out first thing, then leave them in soak, in a tub, the baby['s] 
diapers, ya see?
TL:       What do ya soak 'em in?
BJ:       Water. Jus', Jus' plain water.   Jus' plain water at first s--
see?   An' [you] then, you know, if I don' wanna -- I'm gonna wash 
'em that day or the next day anyhow, when I git enough of 'em 
in there.   An' so, if I had to go to work 'an leave diapers in 
[the] a tub, [well,] or if I'd be started washin' an sump-- if I had to 
go to work an' leave all the clo'es in the tub?   Many nights -- 
I got the globe to the house now, that my husband bought; put a 
light outside, great, big shiney light.    An' he'd go out there
an' put that light out there an' he'd wash them clo'es out an'
hang 'em out at night if ['q] I'm goin' to work in one of the 
white folks' house at night.
         He come in around 5 o'clock.   I'm so used to havin' supper 
at 5 o'clock that it's years before I could git, git it outa me.
I say it seem to me it's foolish to have supper after dar-- night. 
TL:      Really?
BJ:      Ye-ah.   It still don't look right to me.   Heh, heh, heh! 
It still. . . That's true!    Cause for years, ya know, I, I had that 
supper done, when he come in.    If I was home.    An' if I wasn' home, 
I'd leave it prepared, then he could jus' go ahead on, [an'] git his 
supper, ya see.   An' uh, [in] but other words, he would take, if ah he git 
in home before I did, in that, either, I had to go [ask him] after some 
time.   He'd come in home, I said, "I'm goin' to work at Miz So-an'-so 
tonight an' cook supper for her an' be there with the chirrun, 2
