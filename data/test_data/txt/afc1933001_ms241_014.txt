Dear Father:

I suggest that you write Mr. Jason and tell him
that you have ideas for folksong films, but that you
wish to know in advance what he would expect to spend
on a one, two or three-reel film and ask him what
evidence he can give you of his financial standing.
Movies cost an enormous amount of money and $10,000.00
is not too much for a two-reel picture lasting five
minutes, especially if it is made in the field.  I
think I can get competent and objective advice for you
on any proposition he will make you.

I am today writing Mrs. Tartt a long-due letter
and I am drawing up a budget for a field trip for you
and Mrs. Tartt.

Let me hear how things go in Colorado.

Much love,

AL a    Alan
