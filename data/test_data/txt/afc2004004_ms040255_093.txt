The White Cockade
21, 8
My love was born in Aberdeen
The bonniest lad that ye air hae seen
But now he makes my heart for sad
He's in the field wi his white cockade
    O he's a rantin rovin blade
    O he's a brisk & a bonny lad
    Betide what may my heart is glad
    To see my lad in his white cockade

I'll sell my rock, I'll sell my reel
My __________ came & my spinning wheel
Tae buy my lad a tartan plaid
A braid saw (?) disk & a white cockade
(Hugh knows a counting song in Gaellic)

MO THASOAN BOIDHEACH
p. 84 & 5, Chambers.

The bonniest lad that e'er I saw
Bonny laddie, hielan laddie
Wore a plaid & gear for braw
On his heid a bonnet blue
His royal heart _____ faith firm & true

Geordie sits in Charlie's chair
Deil tach him gin he sit there
Cli yet shall mount the throne
Well ye ken that it's his own

Weary for the lowland loon
Wha stole frae him his father's croon
Blessing on the kilted clan
Wha focht for him at Preston's Pass
