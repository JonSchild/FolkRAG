1.  Buy Defence Bonds and Stamps
for
a dirty bunch of rats,
who are those two timing Japs
2.  We've got to win his war against 
the Japs
The only way we can is by showing them their saps.
3.  To do our part 
Weve got to start
Buying Defense Stamps and Bonds
4.  To beat the Japs we must begin
Buying Defense stamps and Bonds, so we will win
