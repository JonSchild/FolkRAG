I think that song compared ... like
that, you know.

L:  What's it mean -- the angels came down--

J:  Well, you see, just the way they had imagine
in old time back, you know, they'd get happy,
you know & just like angel came down
& trouble the waters -- just like the blind
men or the lame man & somebody step
in before him, you know.

L:  Did the old folks really believe that when they went
to heaven Abraham would really take them up
in his arms & rock them?

J:  Yessir (4), That's just what they believed
about it with their minds eye.  -- I learnt this
song back in the hills, where I learnt it at.
Just a spiritual, you know, just like you
telling your 'termination - one thing or another.
A triumphant song.
