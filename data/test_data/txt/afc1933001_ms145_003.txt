Mr. Alan Lomax
124 West 12th Street
New York City

Dear Mr. Lomax:

Having received very few reports from you since you 
left for New York, I am naturally somewhat concerned.  The 
Librarian inquired about this recently and I fear that I
did not have sufficient information regarding your activities
to give him a clear picture of what was going on.  
Will you please remedy this in the near future?

Father seems to be having a very successful trip but 
he also asked me for more information about you than I 
could give him.

With kindest regards,

Sincerely,
Harold Spivacke
