YOU ASK ME TO DESCRIBE TAOS?

A GREY storm cloud enfolding amethyst mountains,
An eagle feather for an ancient dance,
A rusty dagger that has known new blood,
Hard polished wood and stone and human hearts,
a hand heavy with jeweled bracelets held out for pennies,
A friendly cup of tea within a high-walled patio,
Sophisticated chatter at a cocktail bar,
Mozart over the mountains and reaching to the stars,
Beauty that was yesterday and will be tomorrow,
Blue haze across a sage brush desert,
Dimestore trinkets in an old pueblo,
A small boy writing ugly words on an adobe wall,
A winding road where cottonwoods speak quietly,
Dignity aloof as the mysterious mountains,
Kindness as deep and sweet as river water from the snows,
Loveliness caught forever in a turquoise butterfly . . .
This is Taos.

ONE IN A MILLION

IT is good when a women recognizes worth
In an old, bent hat, or a shabby, well-worn coat;
When she leaves the muddy boots in the hidden berth
He finds for them.  She has struck the right key note
Of harmony in the daily music of life.
When she does not scream nor shrink from fishing worms,
He knows he has married a lovely and perfect wife,
And her infinite patience with dogs and guns confirms
His faith.  When the grass is green and the sun shines warm,
She understands the importance of niblicks and mashies;
When the Lodge parades, she gets out his uniform
And does not forget the regalia and aprons and sashes;
And he rewards her with a great devotion,
As deep and silent as the bed of the ocean.
---MARY WILLIS SHELBURNE

CITY IN SPRING

NOT to these towers of stone
Will spring be shown.

Not in this iron street
Will petals greet
