Dear Mr Engel:
             We are getting what seems
to me some remarkable folk-songs 
that have been created
by the chain gang negros. We
will need from you or Mr
Putnam for use in Louisiana
Mississippi and Tennessee a general
letter of introduction and endorsement 
of the project. Put on
your seal and make the document 
as overpowering officially
as is possible. Send to General
Delivery New Orleans La
  Our large dictaphone
has thus far proved satisfactory
