No the cream o the joke still remains tae be telt,
Fur the bloke that wis turnin' them aff on the belt,
At the peak o production wis so sorely pressed
That the real yin got bunged in alang wi the rest.
With a etc.

So if ever you come on a stane wi'a ring,
Jist sit yersel doon and appoint yesel King,
Fur ther's nane wud be able to challenge yir claim
That youd' croont yersel King on the Destiny Stane.
With a etc..
(Tune: The Ould Orange Flute.)

HAE A MINDIN O'T

O, yon Da o Destinie---hae a mindin o't!
O, yon bonnie companie--hae a mindin o't!
Whin they gaed ti London Toun
An pit Humpty-Dumpty doun
An retaen the Stane o Scone:
--Hae a mindin o't!

Whin the Dean cam on the News--hae a mindin o't!
Wi his jeremiah blues--hae a mindin o't!
Whin the yins at Scotland Yaird
Got the beatin they deserved,
An aa Scotland up an raired:
--Hae a mindin o't!

O, gin Ingland gangs ti war--hae a mindin o't!
We'll keep Jock richt oot the glaur--hae a mindin o't!
Like the coolie an the black,
We'll hae Geordie aff oor back.
Lat him tak his Union Jack
 An--mak a mindin  o't!

            (Tune: Kelvingrove)
