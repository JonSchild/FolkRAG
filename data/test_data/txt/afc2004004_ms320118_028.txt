Time Code:
Tape:  1312 Octa and Dion  1
AL:  Now you said a while ago that you started when. . . . .
Octa:  I had nine years old when I first started to learn.  And
when I had 14 years old, I started playing the dances, public
dance.  And I keep on playing, you was young, huh, about 13
years old.  First come here, get a practice with me, so they
play a long time. . . . . .over 50 years we play together.  I played
for 55 years, around there. . . . .and he retired and I'm retired
too.  So to do something, we can't work, so we got to play. . . . .
AL:  Well you must suit each other pretty well in terms of how
you fit in musically.
Dion:  Yeah, we're so used to playing together, that we can
coordinate, you know, and we play together 20 years or more.
AL:  Do you generally play the harmony with him or do you
play the melody?
Dion:  I play the same melody.
Octa:  We always know what we're going to do, we go in the
same time all the time, when he  turns I turn, he knows
what to do.  That's why we make that kind of music.
AL:  What kind of feeling do you try to get in your sound?
(then repeats question in French)
Dion:  (in French)
Octa:  (in French) then in English:  The same tunes go
together, the fiddle and the accordion, so that's why it
makes that sound.
