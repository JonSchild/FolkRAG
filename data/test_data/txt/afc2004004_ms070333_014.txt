Dear friend:

This will introduce Mr. Alan Lomax, a representative
of the Library of Congress, Division of Music.

He has been assigned to make a study of Finnish
folk songs and for this purpose will spend some time
in Minnesota and Michigan. The results of his work
will, naturally, be of great value.

I suggest that you give him every possible assistance
by directing him to such people as you may know
who ca assist him in his work.

Sincerely yours,
O Kaartinen
Onni Kaartinen, Secretary
