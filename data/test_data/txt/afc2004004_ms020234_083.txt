mule.  He told the mule, said, "Good as I've been to you, feed
you an' take care a you, an' give you everything --" you know, food,
you know, an' everything.  "An' then you won't even -- an', an'
now you won't go as I tell you to go."  He wanted to go to this
place.
     And then the mule spoke.  He said, "[How c--] How can I go, when the,
when the spirit is standin' before me?  When it's, when it's a 
spirit in front of me?"  See?  An' the man looked an' there was the,
these spirits in this tunnel.  See?
TL:  What was the spirit?
BJ:  Spirit was angels, spirit.
TL:  Angels?
BJ:  Yeah, I guess it was angels, but they was spirit.  The Bible
says, "spirit," an' I believe that.  An' so, the spirit was in front
of 'im.  The man seed 'em.  See?  Then he was very sorry that he
had whipped this mule in that way.  He had to back up an' go.
See, there was sumpthin' that God didn't want him to go over

go.  Then after the man had punished the mule so badly, God
fixed it so the mule spoke.  Said, "How kin I go?  There's spirit
in front of me."
     An' so when the mule kill somebody, you know, they they letcha know.  It's
spirit in front of 'em, yessir!  If anything happen to 'im, an'
he cut the fool, how kin he do it?  [It's] When the spirit in front of 'im?
So that been ever since, hum!  It's Bible.  Yessir.
