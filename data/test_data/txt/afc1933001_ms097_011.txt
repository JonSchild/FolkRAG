Dear Mr. Botkin:

    The Dallas Transfer Company informs me that the recording
machine and findings went forward yesterday afternoon by Railway Express,
express charges collect; they billed Mr.Lomax two dollars ($2.00) for packing
and hauling. When I go down to pay that item I shall get the receipts, if the
transfer company hasn't already mailed the express receipt to you. If you can
do anything about refunding the packing charges,we shall appreciate it;if not,that's all
right. I couldn't get anybody to help me with it here at home,and,moreover, some-
body had destroyed the original packing materials and the box-top,perhaps in
enthusiastic housecleaning.

    Contents of shipment as follows:
    1 Presto recording machine
    1 microphone stand
    1 small corrugated box containing:
    microphone and cord
    earphones
    5 cutting needles

I hope everything arrives in good condition. Records will come along soon.
Mr.Lomax is improving but has to "rest" for some time yet.
    Yours sincerely,
    Ruby Terrill Lomax
