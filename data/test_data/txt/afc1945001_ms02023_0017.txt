October 8, 1942

State: Florida   City: Jacksonville   Reported by: Man from Orlando
Place or circumstances in which rumor passed: In my office

Rumor: This man is quite a large dealer in used automobiles and states that
there is extreme difficulty in moving older models because many of his
customers have the idea that the Government plans to conscript these
cars.

He states that there was some newspaper discussion of condemning models
before 1934, but the public has moved this date up to those before 1937, 
with consequent damage to used car sales.
