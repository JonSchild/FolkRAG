MARCH LORRAINE

Oh happy sons of bright Lorraine, Sing the strain once again
The tale of the sonderful maiden brave who lived in fair moselle;
Now sing until the echoes thrill Val and Hill, Ringing still,
In telling the story our fathers told. That shall never grow old.
Joan of sweet Lorraine, her little feet in wooden shoes,
Gentle shepherdess among her flock of lambs and ewes.
Cast aside her frock of wool and clad herself in armor bright, Oh-o-oh
Clad in armor bright, And thus arrayed, All undismayed, Went forth to
fight for her king!

Chorus.

Proud are we, sons of Lorraine From the Hill or the plain
Men of France, ever reday, Strong of arm, brave and steady
Proud the sons of fair Lorrain, From the hill or from the plain
Men of France are every ready, Strong of arm, and ever steady.
Still on high ever defending, Dwells the Main, her care unending,
Still on high defending Dwells the Main, her care unending,
Tho' the foe come by millions, Thy sons will never yield, O
Oh fair Lorraine!
Tho' the foe come by millions, Thy sons will never yield
Oh fair Lorraine!

Yankee Doodle

Fath'r and I went down to camp
Along with Captain Good'im
And there we saw the men and boys
As thick as hasty puddin'

Chorous Yankee Doodle keep it up
Yankee Doodle dandy,
Mind the Music and the step
And with the girls behandy.

2. And there we saw a thousand men,
As rich as Squire David
And what they wasted ev'ry day,
I wish it could be saved

Chorus:

3. And there I saw a swamping gun,
Big as a log of maple
Up on a mighty little car,
A load for father's cattle

Chorus:

THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET

How dear to this heart are the scenes of my childhood
When fond recollection presents them to view
The orchard, the meadow, the deep tangled wildwood
And every loved spot that my infancy knew.
The wide spreading pond and the mill that stood by it,
The bridge and the rock where the cataract fell
The cot of my father, the dairy house night it,
And e'en the rude buck-et that hung in the well

Chorus

The old oaken bucket the iron bound bucket
The moss covered bucket that hung in the well.
