Reel of 9/26/61, Side 1, Song 17

HERE COME UNCLE JESSE
A play song from an old field song

Here come Uncle Jesse,
Coming across the field
In his horse and buggy,
And I know just how he feels.

REFRAIN:
Step, Uncle Jesse,  )
Step, Step.               )  (2)
Walk, Uncle Jesse,
Walk, walk,
Walk, Uncle Jesse, walk.

Now if you want a sweetheart,
I'll tell you what you do,
You get some salt and pepper
And sprinkle it in your shoe.
(REFRAIN)

If you want Uncle Jesse
To do what you want him to do,
You get some garlic and onion
And put it in his shoe.
(REFRAIN)

Here come Uncle Jesse,
He looking very sad,
He lost his cotton and corn
And everything he had.
(REFRAIN)
