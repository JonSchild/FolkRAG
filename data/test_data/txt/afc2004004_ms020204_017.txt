Vera Hall,  reel  8,  page 8 . . . 

me to do and that's baptize this sister.  And so he did, he
baptized her, helt his hand over her head and baptized
her.  Say,  I'm gon discharge my duty.  Say, I ain't got to live
for her, either die for her.  She has to do that herself.
So that was right.  So the mother didn't want her to
be baptized, but she was baptized.  Nobody didn't believe
in her, still don't believe in her.  She sets up in church
now and just makes fun at people.  She was on the choir, they
took her off. Cause she  don't have no religion.  I reckon
I ought not to say it because they say don't judge nobody
but I don't believe in her religion, sure don't.
A:  How can you tell , if you don 't know her background . . . 
Could you tell from the way she'd act in church that she didn't
have good religion.  If you had  a chance to watch her a long
time.  V:  I believe I could.  A:  How would you tell?  V:  Well,
a person that don't know a thing about Christ and don't know- 
never felt the spirit, I just don't believe that they could just- if
a man be up preachin, maybe, he gon come across something that
you felt when you was praying to get religion-- he's gon say
something in that way that you gon feel and you gon feel  either 
happy or real bad or real sorry .  So  if the preacher preachin
and god knows you know he's preachin outa the Bible really tellin the
truth and everybody seems to be happy and enjoyin it and this
person is  sittin up there  with their head down-- don't 
matter what you do-- you can preach , just  preach yourself to 
death, sing yourself to death, nothin don't arrouse them, nothing
