As we rode along we often sang. [The other] One day his song
was an appeal to Old Hannah(the sun) to go down.

      "About three O'clock on a hot summer day de sun forgits
to move an' stops. Den de mens sing dis song:"

Been a great long time since Hannah went down, 
          Oh, Hannah, go down;
Been a great long time since Hannah went down, 
          Oh, Hannah, go down!

She's gone behind dem western hills, 
          Oh, Hannah, go down;
She's gone behind dem western hills, 
          Oh, Hannah, go down!

I wonder where is de Captain gone?
          Oh, Hannah, go down;
I wonder where is de Captain gone?
          Oh, Hannah, go down!

He's gone to de house for to ring de bell, 
          Oh, Hannah, go down;
He's gone to de house for to ring de bell, 
          Oh, Hannah, go down!

Bullies, did you hear whut de Captain said?
          Oh, Hannah, go down;
Bullies, did you hear whut de Captain said?
          Oh, Hannah, go down!

Bullies, if you'll work I'm goin' trust you well, 
          Oh, Hannah, go down,
And if you don't I'm goin' give you hell,
          Oh, Hannah, go down!

You oughta come on dis river in 1904, 
          Oh, Hannah, go down;
You'd-a find dead niggers on e'vy turn-row,
          Oh, Hannah, go down!

Then again, you oughta come on dis river in 1910, 
          Oh, Hannah, go down;
They's wuz wukkin' de wimmens like dey wuz wukkin'  
                       de men,
          Oh, Hannah, go down!

We got-ta a good Captain but de squabblin' boss,
          Oh, Hannah, go down;
An' a mean dog sergeant an' he won't knock off,
          Oh, Hannah, go down!

Well, de sergeant got a watch an' its jest like mine,
          Oh, Hannah, go down;
Well, the thing keeps tickin' but it won't  keep time,
          Oh, Hannah, go down!
