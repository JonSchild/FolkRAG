Lomax: 

1. And the skies are not cloudy all day. 
2. Home, home on the range, where , etc. 
3. 2nd stanza- 

   where the air is so pure, the zephyrs so free, 
   The breezes so calming and light, 
    That I would not exchange my home on the range 
    For all the cities so bright. 

 4  3rd Stanza - 
 
     The red man was pressed from this part of 
      the west, 
     He's likely no more to return 
     To the banks of Red River where seldom if ever
     Then flickering camp fires born. 

5. 4th stanza- 

     With the Right, etc. 

6. 5th Stanza - 
    
 Oh, I love these wild flowers in this 
   dear land of ours, 
The curfew I love to hear scream,
And I love the white rocks and the antelope
    flocks
That graze on the mountain-tops sreen.

7. 6th Stanza - 

Oh, give me a land where the bright diamond sand
Flows leisurely down the stream;
Where the graceful white swan goes gliding along
Like a maid in a heavenly dream.

8. 7th Stanza - 

Then I would not exchange my home on the range,
Where the deer and the antelope play;
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day.
