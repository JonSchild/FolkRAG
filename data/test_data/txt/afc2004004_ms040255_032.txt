which appears to be Swedish in origin! It appears in
the marching song of the C.R.E. under the words "Tussue
paper, tissue paper, marmalade and jam."!
     Have recently acquired a tape recorder and am going to
invite some ex-servicemen for a "session" ----though needless
to say I'll have a bucket of water ready in case the tape
catches fire!
     If you're interested in any of my songs I'd be very
glad to send them and would even more pleased to meet
you when you come back to England.
     Have you any "unattached tunes"? I mention this
because I'm a recorder player, and love playing folk-songs.
If so, would you send me some suitable songs or dances?
You might possibly have heard me play, as I have dome four solo
broadcasts on the B.B.C. and three from Radio Eireann
(Dublin), although I've never broadcast folk-songs, but usually
sonatas with harpsichord or piano. Malcolm Arnold and
George Linstead have both written fine sonatas for me,
both of which I've broadcast. Clive Richardson has written
a light piece for me which I'm hoping to record soon. So
if you'd contemplate having me on one of your programmes
I'd be very pleased.
     Hoping to hear from you,
     Yours sincerely,
     Philip Rodgers
