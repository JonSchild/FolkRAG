their best resulted eyestrain, headaches, exhaustion. Some of 
them bought eyeshades, but eyeshades are no substitute for good
lighting.

Before they all went blind they appealed to the union adjustment
committee, the adjustment committee discussed it in an
amiable conference with the administration and the lights were
fixed. The stenographers are still tired, of course, at the end of 
the day, but that's from working hard, and not from bad lighting,
and they don't have eyestrain any more or splitting headaches.

No one's fault, yet no stenographer would have gone to the
chief alone to complain about the lighting, and the condition
would have just continued. Without the union the typists' eyes
would have suffered, efficiency would have fallen down, all along
the line things would have sagged.

The Case Of Jones

Or Mr. Jones, you know Mr. Jones. Before the adjustment 
committee straightened him out he used to talk all the time about
how hard he worked. To believe him he was doing twice as
much work as anyone in the office. The boss always piled work
on him, and while everyone else loafed Mr. Jones carried the entire
office. And, of course, Mr. Jones really believed it.

Finally he could stand it no longer and he took it up with the
adjustment committee. it developed then that he really wasn't
doing all the work in the office at all, he was just doing his share.
Mr. Jones just thought he was doing all the work. But when
he sat down before the facts with the adjustment committee he
found out about himself. Since he was a decent fellow at heart,
that ended that grievance finally. Mr. Jones himself was relieved,
and it goes without saying that the office was relieved.

Then again, some jobs do come to an end, people must be
let go occasionally. But how should they be let go? On the
basis of efficiency? Senority? Personal friendship? Political
pull? Well, you say, maybe seniority, maybe efficiency, but personal
friendship and political pull ought to be out.
