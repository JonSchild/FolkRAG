LARRY:
Out here in Long Island somewhere. I don't know where it was.
MRS. DAVIS:
It was about an hour and half drive, way out somplace. It was at a church. The boys told me when they brought him back, the bring him back, they got back to the house about 12:00 and they said it was a very, very good concert. Although he wasn't too well but he went on and did it anyway. He had a strong constitution had strong will power and thats what carry him long.
LARRY:
Brother Davis was also a business man too. When he had that Guitar Shop where that place, sold those guitars up there in the Bronx. Now he would try to keep that business going, working with Reeds, working against him and everything. He tried to make it work (?)
MRS. DAVIS:
I wasn't so keen about the Music Shop because it was in the wrong spot thats why I didn't like it. I didn't like for him to have it and I pleaded with him not to spend the money, I'd rather not have it because I seen a lot of people wasn't too good around here.
LARRY:
The whole neighborhood wasn't no good.
