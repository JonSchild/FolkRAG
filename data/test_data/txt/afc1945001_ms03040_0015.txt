From Margery C. Quigley, Montclair, New Jersey
Heard in Montclair, New Jersey, August 12, 1942
Subject: GOVERNMENT WASTE AND SPENDING

"When I went up and down our block as a Minute Man, a well-to-do
man said to me, 'This is just another dodge of the administration to get
money. I would not feel so hostile if such terrific waste were not
going on.' He is a sugar broker so this may account for his attitude."
