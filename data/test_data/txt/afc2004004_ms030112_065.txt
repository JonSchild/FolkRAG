MRS. DAVIS:
I had a moving van to move me out and I told the moving
van, now if you take care of my furniture and don't break up
nothing, I will give everyone of you a tip which I did. A treat,
When you moving your good time, your place everything in your
house, you don't have to do anything, all you have to do
is tell them where these things belong, and that was that.

LIONEL:
What did he think about the house?

MRS. DAVIS:
Oh he thought it was wonderful, and he liked this house,
even the last days he spent here, he talked about the house,
anybody come in here, he say Did you see my little Rabbit
box house.

LARRY:
That what he told me once.

MRS. DAVIS:
I say to him, Why did you call the house a Rabbit box?
He says, well thats just the name I got for it. A little rabbit
box.

LARRY:
I know he told me once, when I first come out here, he says
Larry it makes me feel good to be able to invite you to my rabbit
box. I feel alright., you know.
