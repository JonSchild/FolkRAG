Gambler's Song
This life is but a game of cares which everyone must
learn-Each cuts and shuffles and deals the cards. And
Then his trump doth {show} turn.
Some may turn a high card while others turn a
low And some may be quite flush with trumps While
others none can show.
Letter Song
(With a florrish)
i wish I were a scholar and could write some fine hand-I'd
send my love a letter which she could understand. I'd
sent it o'er the waters where islands oe'r flow
