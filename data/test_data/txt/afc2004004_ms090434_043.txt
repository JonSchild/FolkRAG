S.H. Kyle Plantation
By Josie Young
Oh, I am so grateful to the
Lord for taking care of me from
the earliest of my existance until 
now. I have landed over in
the year 48 whether I keep alive
to the end or no.  When I speaks
about myself, I means Mother 
and George too.
I went to Clarksdale Sunday
night to the Centennial Church.
