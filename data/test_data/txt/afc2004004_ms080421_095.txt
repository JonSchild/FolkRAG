in here?
Ray: Well uh, I just don't feel good about it, but when they buy it
it's theirun you know... to do what they want to with. See, that's
our lead of the County seats, of the deeds, when you buy it, it's
yours -- to sell it or do whatever you want with it, it's like with
me here now. I can sell this, and nobody here can't stop me, you
see, it's what it means. It's yours when you pay the money for it
Stan: But us mountain people back in here, none of us don't feel good
about it. Because it's a crowdin' us out everyday.
Ray: Just like I said, we was raised different. And the only way it
gonna be different is when we've out(?), memory's gone. They don('t)
feel that way, they wasn't raised that way.
Stan: And one more thing, they don't stay with ya here when it gets
bad and snowin and bad stuff like that. They go to Florida summers
and we take the bad with the good. We take the snow, we take
the rain, and they go back down there...And they don't have to be 
here in the wintertime, but we have to stay here so...Our forefathers
just put it like it is, back, they sold it away from their
younguns, and it's gone. So the younguns is got nowheres to go.
Ray: I tell ya!
AL: But you all feel good when these people first came in here,
though, didn't you?
Stan: I never did.
Ray: No, I never did, nuhuh.
Stan: I like friends, I like good friends, and I like good to see 
people. But just to come and buy a lot, then post it and leave i
I don't like it.
Ray: I went and worked up here on the beeches, talkin' with 'em,
