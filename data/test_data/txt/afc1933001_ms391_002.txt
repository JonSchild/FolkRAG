Ladies & gentlemen -
    There's no song, I think, that better
expresses the essential qualities of Texas folk
song than [the] one that Frank Dobie's brother
helped us record down in the brush country
near Cotulla. The old vaquero [was about half]
[drunk and] didn't know what this contraption
was we had pointed at him and
[he saw?]  [we recorded him] so we caught
him natural along with the whicker
of his pony off in the Brush --
yo soy de la tierra
y de donde por allá
Donde por allá
y [ni?] el sol se mira al salir
Jovencita pidale à Días
Que no me voya [a]
[?] ya me voy a navequer[?]
2 [Yo me voy a naviquar[?]
   [Sabe dios ni volveré.
Now for them as knows less
Spanish than my smidgen that means
-- in the mouth of a traveling Mexican
wagoner-
[?] are from the country
Way off down yon'der,
