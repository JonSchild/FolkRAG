Hard Time - Cox
Tough, yes I've heard my father talk about his
time. He told me he'd break his neck, near like,
for a crust of bread as big as a thumbnail, &
they never had no tea. They used to burn a 
little bit of bread to make their tea, or burnt
crust. Just toast burnt all black & put in a 
kettle. They were tough times. He got 9 shillings
a week. Sixty hours a week.
