TAPE 40 COLUMN KEANE:
Soldier Soldier:  Music
1) Soldier, soldier will you marry me now?
With your hey with your ho
With the sound of your drum.
No, fair maid, I couldn't marry you
I have no jacket for to put on.
2) She ran to the shop as quick as she could run,
With your hey with your ho
With the sound of your drum.
And she brought him a jacket of the very, very best,
And here, my small man, put this on.
3) Shirt.
4) Boots.
5) Stockings.
6) Soldier, soldier will you marry me now
With your hey with your ho
With the sound of your drum?
No fair mind I couldn't marry you
I have my own wife at home.
