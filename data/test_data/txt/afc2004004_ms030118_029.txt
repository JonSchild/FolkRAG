Those friends would invite me workin.
     (Me:  Rev. Davis, is that why you have the habit of
sleeping sitting up sometimes?)
     Thass right.
     ((Bernie comes in.))
     (Bernie:  Hello Rev. Davis.  Don't you remember me?
I met you over at Elizabeth's house one night.  You started an
argument with me.)
     No!  What was it about?
     (Bernie:  Oh, I don't remember.  It wasn't very important.
     Well, bless yo soul!  How you feel?  Well how you been
suh?
     (Bernie:  Very well thank you.  Working very hard.)
     (Me:  I wish you all would start another argument right
now.)
     (Bernie:  I haven't got time.  Elizabeth, I just got 
two more articles to do.  I've got about four or five articles that
I've got to get in in the next two weeks. . .
     (For some reason Pat and I are laughing loudly)
     (Bernie:  Are you going out to the country on Friday?
     (Me:  Yeah.)
     (Bernie:  Yo u want to take Joel and me up?)
     (Me: Yeah.  Sure.
     (Pat:  I'm goin.)
     (Bernie:  Oh.  You are? . . .What time are you leaving
Friday?)
     (Now Rev. Davis, who will not tolerate this conversation,
begins to raise his voice, but it is indistinguishable
above the babble.  At last however)
