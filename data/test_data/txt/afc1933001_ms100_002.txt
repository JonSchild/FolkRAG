       Would you be kind enough to send me some information on the life of John A. Lomax, the collector of the book, "Songs of the Cattle Trail and Cow Camp." I'm making a term report on his life in American Literature and my professor suggested that you might send me some information about him.
    Thank you very much. 
           Sincerely yours,
