There's a limit I went beyond
and that lasted longer than
ten years. You can put
aside some and all my
demands till you are
again at your desk.

I'l track Mr. Spivacke's
instructions to the letter even
though I lessen the number
of ballads.

Be sure to send me
your revised list and write
those letters ahead.

Lovingly, Father.

We are hoping to hear
 your Monday's program
though reception in this valley is poor.
This is a lovely spot but several miles farther from Washington
than the N.C. mountains. Take a good rest. Much love
Dearie.
