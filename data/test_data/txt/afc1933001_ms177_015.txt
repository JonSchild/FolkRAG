Dear Alan:
     We have been studying your outline very carefully and I was
also glad to get the section for the last chapter on Jelly Roll Morton.
     I am sorry to say that even with this material in hand plus [the section of]
the book to which you referred me we are having trouble lining the
book up from the sales point of view. Our readers think that a book
made up of this raw material of life would be a very interesting
document, but they wonder what its appeal would be to the average reader.
Obviously there would have to be an introduction to it, but I am
wondering if it might not be necessary also to add some connective
tissue which would serve to give more unity to the book as a whole, to
supply some background to the individual chapters, and possibly point
up their significance.
     Frankly, the situation is this, we are very much interested 
in you as a writer and intrigued with the idea, but we find it very
difficult to evaluate the book from the very small amount of material 
which we have. I am wondering if you are going to be in New York in
the near future and could talk the thing over with me then, or, barring
that, if you could shape up a bit of the introduction and connective
tissues to that we could get a bit more explicitly your idea of the whole.
