Dear Sirs:

My attention has been called to a bit of verse of
mine entitled, "The Lavender Cowboy," included in a book
published by you, entitled, "Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier
Ballads," collected by John A. and Alan Lomax.

Permission was not asked for - nor granted - to
reprint this verse.

I originally wrote and published this verse in
"Ace-High Magazine," and it was included later on in a 
collection of my Western ballads under the title of
"Singing Rawhide," by George H.Doran Company in 1926, and 
later put on a Brunskwick-Collender-Balke record. Only
recently it was brought out in sheet music form by Bob
Miller, Inc., 1619 Broadway, New York City. (See enclosed)
Mr. Miller is now copyright owner, but only of the song 
version. Mr. Doran copyrighted the book in which my verse
appeared, but assigned it to me later on.

For some years now various people have been using
my verse without authority, both in print and on the radio.
I feel that something should be done about paying me for
the use of same. What do you suggest?

Very truly yours,
Harold Hersey

I told Mr. [?]
the story and asked that he
settle [for the] on the work
terms possible. John.
