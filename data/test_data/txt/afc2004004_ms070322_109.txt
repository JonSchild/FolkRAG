me without a bit of support -
I want it. Maybe a good thing
Read this morning in Readers
Digest that psychoanalysts are
prescribing "love" to their patients 
& it works. That's all that's
the matter with me. But it gets
harder when you're older and
more frightened. And one mustn't
forget that the need for love is
directly in conflict with the
competitive agressive character
of our society. It is impossible
to call for "love" in the
abstract. The Fascist gets love
from his girl by destroying
people.
On with this job . . The other 
day I drove into the country for
a moment & the beauty of the
green hills was like a caress from the earth.
