Becky Dean

The levee worker was generally a pretty hard case, as like as not
a murderer or an escaped convict. The levee-camp
women had to be even more more hard-bitten, and Becky Dean,
the only levee-woman to have a ballad-epitaph, must have been a regular
Hell-cat. She made her living shooting craps, playing coon-can
and dealing monte and she was a person who wouldn't allow any monkey-
business. As the song says, however, she did have her 
redeeming qualities. One day, in East St. Louis, when she didn't have
but one thin dime, and was mighty dry, she didn't buy a drink as she wanted to, but loyally 
spent it all "on de sake of [that] the man of mine."
Lead Belly picked the song up from some levee-camp men who came, 
during a lay-off, to help his father with the cotton picking. "These mens
was gamblers, heard them talkin' 'bout Becky Dean, heard them singin'
some few words an' put the rest of the song in there myself."
Dr. George Herzog of Yale University says that this is a typical ]American-] Anglo-American
ballad tune. So far as the stanzas go, however, they [are]
stem from the Negro blues and the levee-camp songs.
