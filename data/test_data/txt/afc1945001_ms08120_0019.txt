Propst, May Elizabeth  Sevent Period
Levin  March 12, 1943

Rynmes

The Slip of the Lip may
Sind a Ship.

Bring in your scrap
and scrap a Jap

Save your pennies
Save your dimes
And buy a war stamp
today

Stop! there dynamite
in that grease, take it
to your butcher.

Buying Bonds and stamp
Will help to sink a
Jap ship.

[*Fol. 120*]
