not seeing how I could ever get
from under the awful tasks I had
proposed for myself - hating the
job anyhow - homesick - longing
for Robin - wondering if I would 
drag bored & burning with longing
through a lifelong of torment -
and thinking that I would really
 crack up - then, for the first
time in my life, I put off
& postponed out of self protection.
Decided I couldn't go to France,
decided things would have to
wait, decided to go along
the best I could ... Then the
swirling hysteria of anxiety
retreated - and since it has
only threatened me with lonliness
not with immediate disillution -
