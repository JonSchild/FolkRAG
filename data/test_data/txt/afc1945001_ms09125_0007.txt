In a movie picture a guy played Hitler and he
was making a speech: "My people there's
only [*ome*] one thing I wish, and that's [*place*]
peace. The people began to feel glad and
they clapped, for they thought he meant it,
but he continued I want a piece of Italy
a piece of Africa and piece of America and so on.
