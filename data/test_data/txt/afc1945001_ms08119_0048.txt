1. Rumors have been going around that Women's clothing
will be rationed but not the men's clothing.
2. I heard a friend of mine complain at the dinner
table, about not having enough meat to eat (he only had
a pound and a half to eat) So his sister told him he
should be glad he has that much under his nose
now. Wait till meat rationing comes! She swore
that next time she would throw him out of her house if
he complains when the meat rationing goes into
effect
