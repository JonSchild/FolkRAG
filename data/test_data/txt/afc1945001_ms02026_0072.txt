this tale the soldiers have to be captured, tied up, and carried aboard
ship.

4.  The "spy" trials are being reflected in rumors.

Here is one from a middle-class white area:

At a small tea on Friday several friends of mine
were re-telling one of the current spy stories. They
are women of the University community, active and alert,
and somewhere around 40 years old.

The story is, that in a local beauty shop on 55th
or 53rd, a woman came in for a shampoo and wave. She
was unknown to the proprietor except for her name on
the appointment book. After she had gone, it was discovered
that she had left a book behind. The proprietor
(a woman) examined the book for some clue to the customer's
identity, and discovered that it was filled with
maps, plans and codes, as well as odd bits of information
such as, how to know an F.B.I. man. On advice of
her husband, the beauty shop proprietor turned the book
over to the Hyde Park Police. The next morning, the
customer returned, much perturbed over the loss of the
book. A search was made of the shop by one of the
operators, the proprietor being "mum" and the woman,
rumor has it, was taken into custody.

The above story inspired another woman to say that
she had heard that all beauty shops in this neighborhood
were being investigated, due to the "fact" that a shortwave
sending and receiving set had been found in Gottlieb's
Beauty Shop -- a place under suspicion for its clientel 
for some time.

Here is another:

It seems when Churchill and Roosevelt went to Fort
Bragg to see an exhibition of paratroopers, the officer
in charge of the troopers was really a spy and planned
to give the orders for them to jump when the planes were
over a forest which would have meant that many of the
troopers would have been injured. Fortunately, this
spy was discovered in time and the maneuver went off as
planned.
