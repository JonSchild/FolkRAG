2)  We flew past Armstrong's factory and up the
'Twas ganging down the railroad bridge, the bus wheel flew off there,
The lasses lost their crinolines, the veils that hid their faces,
I got two black eyes and a broken nose, ganging to Blaydon Races

3)  And when we got the wheel put on away we went again,
But them that had their noses broke they come back ower home,
Some went to the dispensary and some to Dr. Gibb's,
Some to the Infirmary to mend their broken ribbses.

4)   Now when we got to paradise, 'twas then the game began,
There were 4 and 20 on the bus, my, how we danced and sang,
They called on me to sing a song, I gave them Paddy Fagin,
I danced the jig and swung me twig the day we went to Blaydon.

5)   We flew across the chain bridge and into Blaydon toon,
The barman he was talking there, they called him Jacky Broon,
I heard him talking to some chaps and them he was persuading,
To gang to Johnny Ridley's shop, mechanic's hall in Blaydon.

6)   The rain it poured all the day, it made the ground quite muddy,
Coffee Johnny had a white hat on
There were spice stars and monkey shows and old wives selling ciders,
And a chap with a ha'penny round-about shouting "O me lads" for riders.

Pullin' Bracken: Isla Cameron.
1)   Why do I sit and sigh,
Pu'in bracken, pu'in bracken,
Why do I sit and sigh
All alone and weary?

2)   When I see the plover rising, or the curlew wheeling,
Then I trow my mortal lover back to me come stealing.

3)   Why do I sit and sigh,
Pu'in bracken, pu'in bracken  ?
Why do I sit and sigh
On the hillside dreary  ?

4) O but there is something lacking, Oh but I am weary,
Come my bright and bonny lad, come home again to cheer me.

5) Repeat verse one.
