Dear Alan:
   Men like Alexander Woolcott and Irvin Cobb seemed to amazed that I
had no collection of records that I secured Mr. Spivacke's consent to have
copies of fifty records made for a loan to me.  Here is my list. Wherever there
are a number of the same song use your judgment of the best. I'd like to
or three John Henry's. Few of the later records are included. Please select 
them for me, including a variety of the most musical and folksy for playing
to the average person; also include any others especially good ones that I may have missed.  In copying, in each case, complete a full side. (When the song
is long and runs over, one side is enough)
1.  Aint it hard to be a Right Black Nigger
2.  Bad Man Ballad
3.  Batson (one side enough)
4. Black Betty
5.Black Gal
6.  Bring me a Little Water,Silvy
7. Calling Train
8. Careless Love
9. Chopping Song
10. Cotton Picking Song
11. Dance Calls (261 A1)
12. Death Comes Creepin' at My Do'
13. De Blood Done Sign My Name
14.Devil Told Job
15. Didn't it Rain
16. Don't Talk about It
17. Drinkin' of de Wine
18.Dyin'-Red Maker
19. Every Mail Day
20. Rich Old Lady (Farmer's Cursed Wife)
