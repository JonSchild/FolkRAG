[Ain' Bothered a Bit]

Got on de dummy an' de dummy didn' run.
Stop an' let me tell you what de dummy done.
(write in chorus as above)
Left Atalanta 'bout half past one,
Made it all around by de settin' of de sun.

Got on de dummy, didn' pay no fare,
Police ask me, "What you doin' oon there?"

Caught me by de hand an' led me to de do',
Hit me ov' de head wid a two-by-fo.

Hit me ov' de head wid a two-by-fo, --
"Don' let me catch you on de dummy no mo'!"

Tole de cap'n ol' Ben was dead,
Didn' do nothin' but nod his head.

Chorus: **
But I ain' bothered a bit,
But I ain' bothered a bit.
or
Lawd, I ain' bothered a bit.
Lawd, I ain' bothered a bit.

Jaybird flew in de grocery sto'
Runned* all over dat grocery flo'.

Runned in de coffee, runned in de tea,
Hadn'-a been watchin' he'd-a runned on me.

Runned in de flour, runned in de jam,
If dat ain' runnin' I will be damn.

I'm so glad 'til I'm about to shout,
Me an' my whora had a fallin' out.

Woman tole de man he deen' to grin,
"Cause-a money was made to spen'."

Meet a woman, lookin' good an' brown,
Tell me, "You wanta whop a dollar down?"

"Looky here, gal, you needn' to fly,
Before you get to heave, you got to lay down an' die."

Lead Belly Speaks: Two whores was jivin' one another. One of 'em want to make
the other one mad, want to make her fight.

Lead Belly Sings: "Looky here, ga, you needn' to talk,
I know you been doin' it by de way you walk."

**Repeat chorus after each two line stanza.
Lead Belly's own censoring.
