my embarrassment was so great I
hardly lifted[?] my eyes from the
paper. [No] My surprise and pleasure
was complete when [at the als] the
paper was greated with hearty applause[?]
[by so] from listeners[?] many
of whom were in tears. Among
those who came forward to congratulate
me were two publishers? agents
who wished to issue of small de luxe[?] volume
containing the text of the lecture

But I wished[?] to sum[?] it for future
platforms [trials], [since[?]], since then I have repeated its
text probably a hundred times before
college audiences.
