Dear Sir:

Under date of February 24th we shipped one recording machine on the
instructions of Mrs. John A. Lomax, and through error the packing 
charges were invoiced against Mrs. Lomax.

Under date of March 5th, and again on March 18th, we requested you,
on the instructions of Mrs. Lomax, to forward us a check for $2.00
to cover this expense.

We are this date in receipt of your letter addressed to Mrs. Lomax,
dated March 11th, stating that you were taking care of the charges
which were assessed by our company for packing; however, up to date
we have not received your check.

As this is a small item, we would appreciate you forwarding check 
to cover by return mail.

Very truly yours,
DALLAS TRANSFER & TERMINAL WHSE. CO.
