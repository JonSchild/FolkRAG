BJ:  No, they, they go an'. . .Some, some of 'em stayed in town to
night, you know.  'Till after night, an' night.  Some of 'em goes
home early, an' they. . .I wish that was mostly. . .I were, ah,
accustomed to goin' home kinda early, ya know.  Very seldom used to
stay in town until night, unless it's a show, you know, a big
carnival there, or sumpin' like that, you know, big show.
     In those days, the carnival, the shows, would be sure that
they come so they could be over Saturdays, you know, so that, you
know, so that all the farmers could come in, you know, to the
show.  Now, that's the time we be in there 'till after night,
most of the time, see.

around to that cafe.  An' ah, jus' be in there. . . 
TL:  Well, what kind of things would go on in the cafe on Saturday
night?
