Southern song recital with historical sketches

The artist will appear in
ante-bellum costume.

This program will contain both negro and white Spirituals,
the songs of Stephen Foster and of other prominent song
writers of the South, particularly those songs which deal
with early Louisiana history, such as the Creole Negro
Plantation songs, the Bayou Ballads and Cajun music
depicting the folklore of the Bayou Country.

Old New Orleans will be remembered with love songs of Old
Spain and France, and other ballads of this period.

The plantation life of Natchez and the surrounding country
will be depicted by songs suitable to that period of the
South, which is so rich in glamorous history.
