SOUP, SOUP

'Way down yonder,
Soup, soup,
Beyond the moon,
Soup, soup.
I got a letter,
Soup, soup,
From Alma Stone,
Soup, soup.
There ain't but one thing,
Soup, soup,
That I dislike,
Soup, soup,
That's puttin' on airs,
Soup, soup,
An' ballin' the jack,
Soup, soup.

That buzzard soup,
That rabbit soup,
That gopher soup,
That money soup,
(Continue adding any kind of soup.)

The group forms a circle and all clap hands. One at a 
time, each dancer goes into the middle of the ring, 
prances around as he is clapping, and picks a partner. 
At "Ain't but one thing that I dislike," the partners 
ball the jack (that is, sway their hips, going down to 
the ground and up again).  Then the original dancer goes 
back to his place and the picked partner stays in the
cicle to pick a new partner.  Continue until each one 
in the circle has been chosen once.
