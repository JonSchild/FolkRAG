Dear Alan:

Your letter was so long
reaching me that I am not
sending one to your New York
address.

The whole point about the
American Record Corporation is
that they have made only the first
yearly report and that since they
reply to no letters. Mr. Sokerly
almost threw me out when
I called. I hoped you might
move him.

Your big project I hope
has turned out well. Keep your
head if it [dont] didn't go.
