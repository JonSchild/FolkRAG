Mr. Alan Lomax

Nashville, Tennessee

Dear Alan:

Thank you for your letter of August 7. By you you must
have received the approval for the extension. It was rather
difficult to obtain under present circumstances but Mr.
Mearns kindly gave us the money for it from his own fund.
In accordance with our agreement, I could not charge this
one to the Librarian's fund. I do not understand all
your remarks about leave but suggest that you take that
up when you return to Washington. We can make adjustments
then.

I was very much interested in your remarks on the
attitude of the Negro to the war and am sending Mr. MacLeish
a copy of the pertinent paragraph. I should imagine that
he is the one to handle such things. You might try to
get in touch with him when you return.

With kindest regards,

Sincerely,

Harold Spivacke
Chief, Division of Music
