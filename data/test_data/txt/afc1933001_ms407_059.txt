that a man from Washington 
was coming [from Washington]
to investigate the prison
system of South Carolina
Every prisoner who had a complaint
against the food, brutality
of guards or thought he
should be pardoned would be given
a hearing. The New Deal was
going to be extended to the
convicts. For days the prisoners had
talked of nothing but my coming. Violent altercation had occurred
in the prison yard about who was to see me first, who was
to be the official spokesman, what each should tell, etc. etc.
Desperate for freedom, hungry for an opportunity to talk and
to an officer of Uncle Sam, the excited men were ready to
revolt against the authority of the state of South Carolina.

I have always wished I 
might have heard the story
direct from the convicts.
That was impossible. Better
for me and Lead Belly to
head north.
