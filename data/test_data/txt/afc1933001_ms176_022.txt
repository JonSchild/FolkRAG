Dear Mr. Lomax:

I remember  you very well, and since I had 
lunch with you when I was last in the Library of 
Congress I have, on more than one occasion, expressed
my admiration for your many fine qualities 
I also appreciate your kindly interest in my folk
materials, and would like to have them preserved
in the Library folk-song archive; but I collected 
them for a different purpose first of all.  You may 
be sure, however, that I shall take as much care
as possible not to injure the recordings in making 
my transcriptions. 

With sincere regards,
yours faithfully,
L. W. Chapell
