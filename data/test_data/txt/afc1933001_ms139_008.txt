Dear Dr. Lomax:

I was very glad indeed to receive your letter of November 7 and to
know that you plan to come to Indianapolis sometime next spring or
early summer.

We shall be pleased to arrange again to get together the foreign
groups for your recording machine. Since we had them ready on two
former occasions I would like to suggest that you let us know, if
possible, three or four weeks before your coming the exact day and
hour that you desire to meet three or four of these groups. At least
we should know the day or days so that we can get them toether and
not disappoint them again about your coming.

We shall be very happy to cooperate with you in every way that we can.
We are also glad to know that the Writers' Project, as well as its
personnel, were of assistance to you when you were in Indiana.

Very sincerely yours,
William A. Myers
