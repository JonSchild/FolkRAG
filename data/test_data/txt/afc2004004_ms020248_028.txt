Reel of 10/31/61, Song 2
[*34*]

OL' ROWDY, SLOW

Last year I plowed the ol' blin' ox,
This year I'll plow the mule-oee,
If I don't make but fifteen cents,
I'm gonna carry that home to Julie.

CHORUS:
Ol' Rowdy, slow,
Ol' Rowdy, slow,
I don't care whether I work or no.

My papa say I'm seven years old,
My mama say I'm six,
But I don't care how old I am,
Just since I get it fixed.                  (CHORUS)

My daddy say I'm six years old,
My mama say I'm seven,
But I don't care how old I am,
Just since I get to heaven.            (CHORUS)
