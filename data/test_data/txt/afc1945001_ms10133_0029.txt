1. What are we fighting for? Democracy
What is democracy? Something we don't
have.
2. Wear the khaki uniform and
death will be yours not in
Europe or African but Southern
United States.
3. Lose time on your job, and you
are aiding Hitler, Hirohito &
Mussolini.
4. Feed the Lion (England) who is waiting
for the kill while the Bear (Russia)
starves because of the American
clergy.
5. Fight for your rights whatever
they may be.
