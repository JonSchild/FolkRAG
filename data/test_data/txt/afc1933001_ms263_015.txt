2. The Franco-American Collection in the National Museum of 
Canada, Ottawa                                                          Estimated cost

   This collection of recordings of French-Canadian
and Indian music, brought together by Dr. Marius Barbeau of
the National Museum, is the largest and most important collection 
of folk-songs existing outside of the Library of
Congress. The French folk-song material is absolutely unique
in its importance and I have already received expression
of interest from French scholars at the prospect of our
having it on file in the Library. Dr. Barbeau has generously
agreed to choose for us a large number of the best records
of his collection to be duplicated by us here at the library.
$560.00

3. The Barry ballad collection, Harvard University, Boston, Mass.
   Dr. Barry was the foremost authority on New England
ballads in his time and one of the most important folklore
scholars that ever lived in America. His collection of
cylinders is unique in its importance, and we should have *
it here at the Library.

4. The Virginia Ballad Collection
   Under the direction of Alfonso Smith and Arthur Kyle
Davis of the University of Virginia, the State of Virginia

Scottish ballads made anywhere in the country. Dr. Davis

material throughout the state, and he is willing for the *
Library to duplicate this collection for deposit here.
It will bring into our files another basic body of material 
for the field of American folk-song. There are
records in the collection. Approximate cost:

Total for all items except Estimated
those marked*: $11,127.40
