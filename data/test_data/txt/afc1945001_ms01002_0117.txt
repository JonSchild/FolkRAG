ADVANTAGES  OF  A  STUDY  OF   RUMORS   ON   RATIONING

1.  It will indicate informational needs on the subject of 
rationing (plus other subjects covered).

2.  It will enlarge our understanding of the process of rumor 
development and dissemination, will outline the scope
and nature of the rumor field, and will show whether or 
not a continuing study of rumors is necessary or desirable.

And it is not overly sanguine to expect that:

3.  It will demonstrate that deficiencies in news encourage 
the growth of rumors. (This will be invaluable for use
on the Army and Navy who, on occasion, have shown reluctance 
to release even the bare essentials of a situation).
