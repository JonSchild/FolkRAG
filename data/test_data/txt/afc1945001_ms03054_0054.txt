with the Navy Department.  The Post Office Department says that 
their employees do not make enough money.  While the Post Office
Department in Richmond employs approximately 700 persons, they have
no 10% payroll allotment system in the Post Office and they are 
investing a very small percent of their salaries in war savings
stamps. 

(12)  I talked with two union leaders and both expressed
practically the same rumors.  They have heard on many occasions
that farm organizations are fighting wage stabilization for all 
 unions and that they, the labor unions, are willing that wages should
be frozen and are not interfering with the farm organizations.  This
condition, they say, is creating on offensive feeling between
organized labor and farm organizations.

rumors about racial difficulties during blackouts but that these 
had quieted down.  He said that he had recently heard that the
negroes were very much dissatisfied that they were not given all
the privileges that the whites were receiving, especially after they
had completed the defense training courses that employment 
opportunities were not open for them. 

(14)  I talked with a filling station operator and he said
that many cars had as many as three spare tires in the back compartment. 
People have bought up the surplus tires anticipating
a long war.
