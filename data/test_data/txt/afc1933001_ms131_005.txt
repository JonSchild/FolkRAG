Recommendation that 
Mr. Alan Lomax be sent to 
Bloomington, Indiana.

Mr. Alan Lomax of the staff of the Music Division has been invited to 
speak at the meeting of the Hoosier Folklore Society of Indiana on April 2.
I recommend that Mr. Lomax be sent to Bloomington, Indiana at that time as 
the official representative of the Library and that he spend about two or 
three weeks while in Indiana to record available folk-songs in that region.

I recommend, also that Mr. Lomax receive per diem and mileage allowance 
for this trip, to be paid out of the appropriation for the Increase of 
the Library.

Acting-Chief,
Division of Music
