Nimrod: Yeah, 54 years ago. (he sings)

There lived a lady, a lady gay
Of children she had three
She sent them away to the north country
There to learn most grandly (?)

They had been gone but a very short while

All through their mother's home.

Spread all over with bread and wine.
Come eat, come eat, my three little babes
Come eat and drink of wine.

nor neither drink your wine
For yonder stands our saviour dear
On him we must rely.

Spread over with clean sheets
And over hop with a golden spread
All to make those babies sleep.

Take it off, take it off, cried the oldest one.

Take it off, take it off, cried the younger one.
Till cocks don't crow for days.

Cold clay at our feet
Them tears you shed is not for us
have wet your winding sheets.
