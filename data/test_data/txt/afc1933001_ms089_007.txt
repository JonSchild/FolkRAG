You know how Dick is - usually
merry and jocular, but with a serious
undertone, a first rate fellow and a
faithful friend.

When Phipps came on the stage
Fred asked him "What d'ya
know?" but the crowd didn't
seem to get the reference to the
well known song "What dya know
Joe?" [under] answered by "I ain't
talkin', I dont know. Garland
Day insisted on taking me to see
Fred after the show, and explained
that we were with the Texas crowd.
Allen was very friendly, but befuddled,
hadn't realized we were from the
University of Texas but thought it

Anyhow the only thing worth
mentioning is that Bess Brown was
just like herself, enjoying her work
and will be glad to come down at
State St. sometimes and go out
riding with us to see New York and
adjacent states or political subdivisions
thereof. Yours [?]
