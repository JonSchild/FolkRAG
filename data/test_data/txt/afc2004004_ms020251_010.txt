Reel of 10/4/61, Side 2, Song 18

IN THE BRICKYARD
One gets in the middle of the ring of children and those forming
the ring may clap and sing or go around:
'Way down yonder in the brickyard,
Remember me,
'Way don yonder in the brickyard,
Remember me.
Now the one in the middle choses a partner from the ring and they
"step it" together in the "brickyard" -- the center of the ring:
Oh, step it, step it, step it down,
Remember me,
Oh, turn your love and swing her 'round,
Remember me.
Now that couple joins the ring, another one gets in the middle,
and the game continues until all have been "in the brickyard."
