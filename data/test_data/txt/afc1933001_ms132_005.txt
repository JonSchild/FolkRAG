Dear Mr. Lomax:

I was pleased to read your most interesting letter. We did not expect much from Cincinnati so I was not surprised to hear of your experiences there. But your success in Indiana so far is most encouraging. 

Your pay check was sent you on March 31 and must have reached you by now. I suggest that you put in a per diem and mileage voucher immediately. I shall see that it is rushed at this end.

Sincerely,

Acting-Chief,
Division of Music
