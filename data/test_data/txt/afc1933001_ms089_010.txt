worst off I hope we can ask
Alan and his wife over sometime.
We've been living like hermits
for months now.

I've seen notices of your
book and hope to get a copy -
perhaps for Cletus' Christmas.
I'm afraid that now that
Bess is out of Bryn Mawr
you won't be coming this way,
but don't forget you are not
to get as far north as Washington
without coming here. I'm sure,
Miss Terrill, you're finding
life interesting just trying to keep
a jump ahead of the Lomax clan.
We all send love and the season's
greetings to the whole family
Yours - LGO

Today I feel weak
with relief: Cletus has just
been delivered of his first

veteran authors, but don't
forget what a feat the first-born
was. It has taken Cletus
quite a while to finish up because
of his regular duties
which now include defense
