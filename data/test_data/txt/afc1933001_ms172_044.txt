Dear Alan Lomax:

When I got word that you had been in Chapel Hill and had not come 
on over here, I was pretty near to working up a case of resentment.
All the things I had stored up to talk with you about, and the
optimistic fervor of your letter from Mexico City. But having driven
across the continent a few times, I managed to sympathize with your
decision to go on home.

Sure I've got a good recording project in hand. I have got Ike Greer
of Thomasville hog-tied and ready in September or October to sing me
his entire repertory of traditional songs. You probably know of him:
the superintendent of the Mills Orphanage, born and raised in the
Carolina mountains where he learned a huge repertory of fine songs.
He himself doesn't know how many he has in his repertory; he hasn't
written many of them down, has made no systematic effort to recall
all the songs he used to hear in the mountains. My guess, from talking 
and singing with him, is that he can sing more than a hundred, most of
them of British origin, and quire complete. A genuine folk-singer, with no pretensions to
a voice, but with the exquisite folk style of singing. His wife
accompanies some of his songs on a small dulcimer. he is a provincial
person, not at all impressed by folksong collectors or the commercial
boys. He is getting along in years and under my tutelage has decided
that he would very much like to record his repertory so that it won't be
lost when he goes. I mentioned the Archive to him, and he agreed that
such a depository would be the right place for his songs, and that he'd
be glad to take off a few days in the Fall to sing into an Archive mike,
for me. And for his favorite niece, who is my collaborator in hog-tying him.
He is so busy at the Orphanage that he would have to be abducted to his
niece's apartment in Greensboro; she will also arrange with his secretary
to clear his schedule for three days in September or October, after
his seasonal campaign for funds has subsided. Do you want to go ahead
with this project? My only restriction is that I have first crack at 
publishing his pieces; same arrangement as for the recordings
of Mrs. Newman which we corresponded about this Spring. You don't need to 
come yourself if you are busy, though we'd like to see you, nor send a 
substitute. I know how to operate the recording machines. Be sure to
include a goodly supply of disks; many of his ballads are quite long. And
I hope you'll pick out a first class machine, for Greer has a good strong
voice and clear diction, and should make excellent recordings for your use
in the Archive's educational project. Greer would very much like to have
duplicates of whatever disks we made, and I told him I'd see if that could
be arranged. For God's sake don't let anybody bother him about this project
until the moment comes for me to record him, else he'll get skittish 
and tell us all to go to hell. He has done that before with folklorists.

I've got some other good prospects around here, particularly a group of
