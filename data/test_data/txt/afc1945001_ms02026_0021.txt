Research on War Attitudes (Continued) 4

e. Reports will be secured from "competent" observers within various
community groups concerning the attitudes which they believe to characterize
the groups. The observers will include preachers, social workers, political 
party workers, and civilian defense officials. They will be interviewed
from time to time to obtain their impressions about relevant attitudes based
upon their casual observations and informal conversations with people in the
community. We shall probably provide guiding instructions to them concerning
the types of attitudes we wish to have them report.

f. Finally, a small sample of the general population will be interviewed
with respect to what they think other persons of their acquaintance
think on the matters under investigation.

Findings from all the above methods will be studied in relation to
one another as far as possible.
