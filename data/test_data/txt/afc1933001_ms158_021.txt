Dear Mr. Jacobs:
Enclosed you will find the floor plans of the
section of the Library which we plan to use for a new
studio. The spaces is 22' wide, 11' high to the beam,
12' to ceiling. We can use as much of this space as
is necessary. The lighting fixtures are the hanging
type, but I hope to replace these with the fluorescent
lamps.
I think you have all of the necessary information
regarding our plans but, if anything else occurs to
me, I will send it along to you. I told Dr. Spivacke
of your offer to help use and he was very appreciative.
I too am glad to have some one with your experience
and authority working on the studio.
Very truly yours,
