Fisk,  9.     15. 

Smoking cigarettes
Will kill you dead, 
Will kill you dead. 
I goes to the Gypsies 
To get my fortune told, 
Say what I dine on
Til I git old. 

To the Gypsies 
To git my fortune told, 
The Gypsies told me 
About a sweet jelly roll. 
Oh, Iâ€™ll get a sweet jelly roll.

I asked that woman
How about it, 
She said, all right. 
I pulled off my clothes, 
[Z]And I stayed all night. 
Oh, Lord, and I stayed all night. 

If the sun shine hot
And the day stay long, 
I'm gonna take the two shaded bushes
To be my home.
