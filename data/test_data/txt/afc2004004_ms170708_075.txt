So now my trial do come over,
An' herelay I condemned to di,
If I had a been in my manners been ruled,
I might have saved the poor boys' life an' mine.
Lomax: Good Christ, that's horrible.
Cox: Oh, o' course, that's how they done. . .
Lomax: Did people behave like that?
Cox: That they did years ago, aboard these boats. I heard talk
about 'em stickin' boys' hands into a pan, an' fryin' their hands;
hot pan.
Lomax: Who would do that?
Cox: Oh, these old skippers aboard o' these here boats years ago.
Lomax: What di they do it for, though? I don't . . .It wouldn't help
discipline, it wouldn't help work. . .
Cox: Well, you know what it is, if a boy didn't do proper, same as
that, they wouldn't ha' it, they go an' take him stick his. . .do
anything to the poor little buggers. Used to kill 'em, nearly. Knock
'em about - that time o' day. Like slaves. They did. You hear a lot
o' 'em talk about it. Some o' 'em are good to 'em, some o' 'em are
rough. (pause) They used to go as a boy, you see; course they
couldn't stand up for theirself. Now they don't allow it.
Lomax: Wasn't any law in those times to restrain 'em?
Cox: I mean they didn't have no. . .not like it is now. They won't
allow it now. (pause)
Lomax: Is this song you have here about the Dogger Bank, is that a 
sea song too?
