12A - Female
Negro

A story was told of one of our 
recent plane crashes. Someone
said that the pilot was 
eighty miles off his course. 
Had he not been off his
course, he would have 
crashed at Paterson Field
field damaging a great part 
of it. Of course they thought
that some saboteur had 
placed a time bomb somewhere 
in the plane. Since
the pilot was supposedly 
off his course, he crashed 
on a house, burning it 
completely.
