a coyote the scream of a
Mexican lion or any of the
[Southern] sudden noises of the 
night. [*So they were soothed to sleep and soothed after T\they were asleep by what the cowboys
called dogie songs. Never a rain storm at night but that the entire band of cowboys were rousted from their beds to "talk" to their cattle and their singing and yodeling helped to stop
many a stampede*]  When the cowboys had
sung to them all the songs that they knew they made up songs
about cowboys like
[Oh lazy [?]dogies, [?] you [?] 
laid down,  
Stretch [?] [?] on the big open
ground  
[S?] land, little dogies, and
drown the wild [?]
That will all go away [till] when the
Lay still little dogies lay still.
A blinding flash of lightning on a sudden]
Early in the morning we round up the dogies
mark them and brand them [dogi] and bob of their tails
Drive up the horses, load up the mess wagon
and throw them dogies up on the trail.
Whoopee- ki-yi-yo, git along little dogies
[SS?] land little dogies, and
dr0wn the wild [?]
That will all go away [till] when the]
day [ rolls around,
Lay still little dogies, lay still.]

So, singing to the slumbering
cattle herd a most practical
nature As a child I, of course, did
not know all this, though, as
it seems to me now, I did feel
the [?]-like beauty of the
cowboy songs of the Texas frontier sifted to me
through the [?] night, [as I lay 
in my trundle bed in an old [?] 
[?] on the Texas frontier.]  At least I 
was proud to remember the words and my early tasks in
penmanship was to set them down in verse form.
All these scraps I put away.   (Insert A)
