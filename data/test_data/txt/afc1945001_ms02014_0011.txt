Mr. William Webber - P2

        Beauty Parlor Operator:  The Beauty Parlor
operator used as a source in Palo Alto, California, proved to be
a complete failure.

        The only comment we have to offer concerning
use of the above people in forthcoming reports is that they should
not be used too often.  It is very easy to over-do a good thing.
I am sure that they will cooperate in any manner you wish, if not
called upon too often.

        Concerning rumor reports or any other reports
in the future, it might be well to have the various report writers
supply a list of their best contacts to your office which could
be used in the same manner as the ones given in this letter.  A
personal description in detail of each person on such a list should
be of aid to your office.

        Respectfully submitted,

        J. Crawford Brooks,
        Administrative Assistant.
