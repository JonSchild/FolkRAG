Dear Alan: In my letter of this morning
I forgot to tell you that on
last Sunday I drove to Denison to
see Harry Stephens, the A.&M. boy
who sent me "The Night Herding Song."
He is coming over to Dallas soon
to tell me the story of that song -
how it grew out of an experience
while herding wild horses at night in the
Yelelowstone Park, where you and Johnny
fought grimly in the first snowbank
we found. Do you want
a record of his story? Also would
you like him to record some of his
experiences with cattle and wild horses
in Idaho, Utah and Arizona thirty-five
years ago, intermingled with the songs
the low high song and the "hollers" they
used in handling the cattle. He talks
very well. How much of this sort
