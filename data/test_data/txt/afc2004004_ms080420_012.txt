is one of the last authentic mountain men in the country.

AL:  What do you mean by that?

Kyle:   Well, when you see Caz, you'll know.

........ AL:  Who would you suggest we go see next?

Kyle:   I would say Raymond Fairchild. He's the world's 
best banjo picker. He's king of the Smokey mt. Band. He got
one of the longest standing ovations that's ever been received
on the GOO stage........In our opinion, he's the best in the
world......Caz is quite an interesting fellow.

AL:   What do you think about working up here in the mountains
all by yourself? You like living in the mountains?

Kyle:   I love living in the mountains. It's a good place to 
raise your family. Me and my son, we come up here and work.
We're fixing this pad here for our own log cabin. Just a 
place to kind of get away. .....

AL:   Why do you like to be off by yourself? A lot of other
people in the world like to be just jammed up together.....
Why do you mountain folks like to be alone?

Kyle:  you can think things out when you get by yourself, look
at nature and study things over, you can kind of come up with
a better solution to all of your problems.

AL:   I think you're all up there tendingyour stills....Tell
me how many children you got.

Kyle:  I've got two, I've got a boy and a girl.....one of them '
a world champion.
