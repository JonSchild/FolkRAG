The Recording Laboratory. 
Without the help of Jerome 
Weisen, Johns Laugeregger + 
their assistants in [?] handling 
equipment, supplies and a thousand 
details, this   of expeditions 
would never have been possible nor 
would it have been possible to 
record Woody Guthrie, Blind Sam 
Terry, Barbara Bell, Marianna 
Schlaup, Governer Elias Juron of the 
Isleta peublo, Hudie Ledbetter and 
a score of other singers who came to 
the Archive during the year. 96 records. 
With the help of the Recording Lab, 
too, the Archive was able to bring in 
for duplication some of the most valuable 
collections of folk song records in 
[?] hands. 
21 records of negro songs made in Tennessee 
and Alabama by John Wools of 
Fisk University, including some 
negro break down tunes as yet unrecorded 
and some songs from The 
Negro Sacred Harp which Dr. 
W?] [discovery]  discovered in 
Southern Alabama.
