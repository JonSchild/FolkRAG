Philadelphia Office     Report made October 14, 1942

RUMOR REPORT

Of the six people we had collecting rumors from October 3rd 
to October 10th, only one, the beauty parlor operator, returned rumors 
conforming with the suggestions contained in your directive. 
This seems rather a poor box score, however, the Philadelphia 
Inquirer's Rumor Clinic also reported a sharp decline in the number of 
rumors sent in during the same period.
We are enclosing some of the rumors the clinic receives. After
breaking them down, we find that the rumors appearing most often are:
1. Those which say Jews are evading 
the draft.
2. Those which claim that Army men are 
being sent overseas with little or no 
training.
There has been no let-up of the rumors, they still persist 
in this area.
