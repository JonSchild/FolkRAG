Liverpool - April 27th.

Waiting for boat time to Dublin
in McManus' oyster bar. Oysters
coming - 10s a dozen.

Liverpool is a grey, hard
town of red bricked smoke
[?]aged houses along the dirty
Mersey. Yet there is more character 
in the faces [of] on the underground 
along the docks than
I have seen elsewhere in England.
The blue, blue grey eyes of the men - 
many Irish - have a purer light
in grimed faces. The lines of the
faces are clearer and stronger.

I took the overhead in to
the end and then walked awhile
[on] along the rows of identical, red
brick, crown-chimneyed houses.
The houses [were] are so much alike
