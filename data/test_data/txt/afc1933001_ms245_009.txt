Dear Father:

Jerry suggests that you do all your recording at 78 RPM, which would probably help things a good deal. Also, watch the needle angle more carefully. 
If you can't do anything else, be sure and go through San Antonio for the two things I've mention there. it's nice to hear that you're recording cattle calls in the south Texas brush country. Don't you worry about your radio programs. just wait until somebody does something better in the next millennium.

I have heard indirectly that Bess is working her head off, but probably enjoying her job a good deal. I wouldn't worry for a while yet, anyhow. I'll keep in touch with her.

Thanks for the pictures, which I prize more than I can tell, especially that of Grandfather, because now I know where I get my evil expression

Mr. Brecker thinks you are one of the great American characters, but wishes that you could break down your inhibitions and get more of yourself into your book. What were some of the wicked things you did on your recording trips?

Devotedly,
Alan

In regard to the base news from Mrs.Tartt, my suggestion is that you do what recording you can on that portion of the budget allocated to your trip to Alabama, and that then you return the machine to us. In the spring we can probably arrange for Mrs. Tartt to record in Alabama, and perhaps it will be possible for you to go there and work with her. That will depend on the budget at that time. You know how sorry I am that the situation developed as it did.
