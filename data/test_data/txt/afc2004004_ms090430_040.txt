Agricultural Pattern

As in practically all counties of the cotton belt, whether active
or stagnant, the great majority of the population is engaged in agriculture.
In Macon County 79.0 per cent of the Negro men and 74.4 per cent of the Negro
women are engaged in the production of cotton. The majority of them are tenant
farmers, and 90.9 per cent of the tenant families of the county are Negro.
Less than 10 per cent of the farm population are farm owners. Land ownership
is not encouraged except on lands long regarded as useless, since it has a
tendency to interfere with the system of tenancy.

The homes of the Negro tenants are the small two and three room
cabins scattered about at intervals corresponding roughly to the average tenant
holdings of twenty or thirty acres. They are worn and bare and stark in
their isolation in the fields.

The farming habits of the people have not changed materially over
the past sixty years. Social habits are only slightly modified from an
earlier period remembered by the oldest of the residents. The traditional
diet of the old plantation, meat, meal and molasses, continues as much through
habit as through poverty. Advances for "furnish" have been limited to $8.00
per month to the plow for five or six months. This amount is increased where
there are numbers of children who can also work in the fields.

The poor quality of the land, the small capital of the landowners
and the impersonal financial interests of absentees owners prompt managers to
get all they can out of the tenants. The practice not infrequently leads to
exploitation of the tenants. An intimate study of a group of these families (1)
