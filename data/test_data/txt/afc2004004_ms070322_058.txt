Friday.
The interval has been filled with writing.
I began gingerly & have this week completed
all but a few pages of Vera's chapter. It
will now be, because of Elizabeth's contribution,
the most moving section of the
book. An inditement of the very soul
of the South from within its tenderest,
most loving - and most loveable part.
I must go straight on with work 
on the book & if it is done, it will 
be the best thing I'll ever do. Also
here in London, with now a long farewell
to Elizabeth & soon to my father,
I find work not so painful. And
soon I will be able to focus.
Robin & the pain of discovering she doesn't
love me & the decision this demands of
me - the the mastery of myself -
clears me for work somehow. Altho
my left eye twitches all the time with strain -
