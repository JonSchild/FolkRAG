    EP:    Well, the craftsmen, I guess, if you check 'em out all over
the United States or all over the world, you'll find they're in the
poorer class of people all the world, but the reason why they're
craftsmen   I guess they're about the more independent people of the
world because they don't want to  be told what to do and when to do
it.   They want to work when they want to, they want to quit when they
get ready.   And  . .I've been amakin' since nineteen, I made the first
un I made in the winter of 19 and 35  . . .     been about a 47 year ago.
And over that period of time, well, I never kept no record of 'em up
until 1956.    I started numberin' 'em in 1956.   And I've made
15 hundred and 20 since then.
    AL:   Show us this one you made and tell us about it.
    EP:   Oh, let's tell about this other one.   It's got more of story
about it.
    AL:    . . .         I'd like to see the one with the designs on it.
    EP:    Well, we'll, we'll look at both of 'em.   This one here, this
is a special one.  I make this un for a North Carolina dulcimer,
started out to make it I used--
    (I'm sorry.  We have a problem displaying the dulcimer in the
sun.  It should be, if you can possibly keep it as much in the 
shadow. . .)

North Carolina dulcimer, I put dogwood on it which is the North
Carolina flower, and the cardinals, North Carolina state bird.
And the wood is made out of birch. I call it catspaw birch, it's 
just knotty birch  . . .               birdseye maple.   And it is one I
made special, I just made it special for my wife, I put her initials
