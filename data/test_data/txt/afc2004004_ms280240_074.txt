McBeth:  Yes, about seventy years ago.

Lomax:  Course, you were never in on that.

McBeth:  No.  I hard my father talk about that.

Lomax:  They did anything they wanted?

McBeth:  It was terrible.  It was joyful times!  At times it was good,
at time...

Lomax:  Your father told you about that?

McBeth: Aye He was one of them that did that.

Lomax:  Every man had his girl and they just paired off at night...

McBeth:  Yes.  They had parties and caries-on.

Lomax:  That must have been wonderful.

McBeth:  O that was a joyful time.

Lomax:  There's nothing wrong with that.  That's what people are
designed for - to make love.

McBeth:  Well, they made love with them right enough.  But they slept 
steady on.  Sometimes they were behind with their work.  They 
slept in.  They wouldn't get up in the morning - got behind with
their work.  I've heard my father telling me that when they tried
to get them up in the morning, they would sleep in, because they were
too long with this girl.  Slept with the girls....

Lomax:  Were they severe on you in the working conditions?

McBeth:  O yes.  It was hard driving.  Slave driving.  They put you
out in all kinds of weather.  A lot of the farmers are away, and a lot
of the farm servants, they're away.  It was terrible times.  They'd 
put them out in all class of weather, and they had terrible
conditions - to lie in the chambers and bothies were terrible,
terrible conditions.  Even mice used to run through the beds - chaff
beds, beds made of chaff - a bed full of chaff and 
that's what they used to sleep in.  And if you laylong in them - they
got rotten and bad and mice - even rats.

Lomax:  And you'd jut fall on that bed of chaff in your clothes.
