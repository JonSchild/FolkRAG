Ya see? Tha's real. They meant a member of that church, that
buildin', tha's all they meant. They don' mean they got nothin'
within. Ya see? But in our church, you gotta be bo'n (born)
again. Ya know? An' really, regenerated an' made.
TL: If you're not born again, then you're not a member of the
council.
BJ: If, if you're not -- tha's right. Tha's right. Tha's right,
