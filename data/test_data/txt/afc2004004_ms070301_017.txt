Wet summer in Galway Connemara ruins the potatoes &
makes selling them impossible People are
cold & hungry.

Old days -- poteen sold at 11 shillings 
a gallon - police raids were kindly —
see p. 170 -

Typhus & TB were very bad.
- stretched out waiting for their
death - –

Smoke let out the door - women's 
complexion smoked ham -- great
deal of blindness

Disaster -- loses wife, potatoes
go bad, cows taken with some
disease of the brain swim out to
sea & drown -- ten children to
care for -- & them wasting the food
in the pot & the man cursing
& damning his fate
