       Memo: In re, recording trip for the Archive
                     of American Folk Song, Summer, 1938.

The material gathered on the Archive's exploratory
trip to Indiana and Ohio has afforded us a partial
idea of what has happened to Anglo-American folk
music in the Middle West. Both of these states, 
however, have been influenced more by currents of
cultural migration from the South and less by the
intrusion of foreign language groups and by the flow
of migration from New England than other Lake States. 

I feel it is important, therefore, before venturing
further west that the Archive turn its attention to 
the Lake States - Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota -
a study of which will give us a picture of an area 
culturally different from the Middle and Far West
and yet important in the growth of these areas. 

In sounding folk-lore resources of this region, the
Archive will be able to record what remains of the
once vigorous lumber-jack culture, to explore the
musical potentialities of the many foreign language
groups of that area (Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish, 
Gaelic, French-Canadian, etc.) and to observe what
have been the results of the mixing of these cultures
with the Anglo-American matrix. 

Since the northern portion of this territory is 
hardly accessible the remainder of the year, I suggest 
that this expedition be planned for July and
August, when woods and rural areas will be completely
accessible. Two months in the field will be the briefest 
period possible for a survey of the region because
I plan to ask the collaboration of local folk-lorists
and field workers and interest them in the work of the
Archive.
