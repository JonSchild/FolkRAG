DF   In the old days when someone died there were no hospitals for black
people, nor for poor whites -- it was rare.  No doctors came to the
house.  The dead person was on his bed; neighbors washed the dead person
where he died.  The next day they buried the body -- no electricity,
no funeral home, nothing of all that.  We were poor and they
covered the casket before the bad weather came.  Sometimes they
were buried with a hat   [1+ minute blank tape]

AL   Do you know any songs about animals, frogs, birds, rabbits?
DF   No, no ……..   [*repeated*]
DF   To learn to dance we sang, even if no juré's, we sang mazurkas.
I[,][*'*]ll sing "Les Haricots" = "Beans"
[Song]  Oh man the beans aren't salted.
            Oh man the beans[*/*]are Calahan.
            Oh man the beans aren't salted
            Oh the beans are Calahan
            Ah the beans aren't salted.
It was warm beans; it was Calahan beans.  [*The beans weren't salted because 
they were Calahan beans. 
[song repeated]*]  [...not impt.]
We dance to that at[*/*]night; it was pretty; we danced misery [la misère].
It was a mazurka, we called that.
[Song]  Oh, lah misery
            Misery is too great
            Ah, misery is too great
            Dance misery
            Oh misery is too great
We called that a mazurka
            Oh, dance the misery
            Dance the misery
            Dance the misery
            Dance the misery
            Dance the misery
            The misery is too hard. [or too great = trop dur]
