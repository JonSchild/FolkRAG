Question: "How many rooms are you looking for and in what 
part of town?" "Any part of the city - 2 bedrooms and bath, of course.
There just aren't any. I have been looking everywhere for one I could 
possibly move my family into. Some of the vacant places are just too 
bad. I just cannot move my family into an unsanitary shack." Question:
"Do you live in San Antonio now or are you required to move?" "My family 
lives in Eagle Pass and they want to come here and I want to make this 
city my home - my work is here."
