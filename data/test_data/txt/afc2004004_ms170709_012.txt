An oh -- the flashlights from the cameras an things.  It was a long, 
long time befo I could git that light o ut of my eyes.  They nearly 
blinded me. Then we got everything an got back on the train to go 
back to Connecticut. You had to catch a certain train or you wouldn't 
get back there. Huddie was jes so overjoyed till he jes set there an 
cried almost all the way back to Connecticut. (laughs) Law! From the 
station there in Wilton we drove to the house. Huddie was the happiest

an stayed almost the balance of that year. I don't care too much
