Grade 12

1 A woman lay on the floor. Above her,
stood a man with a hatchet. Blood was
flowing all over the place. The man picked
up a telephone and dialed a number. After
waiting a few moments, he said "Blood
bank? I have a deposit to make."

2 Two morons (sailors) were painting the side of a
ship. Another moron called down from the
deck - "Hang on to your brushes, boys, we're
lowering the scaffolds."

Did you hear about:  
3 the soldier who walked through a screen door
and strained himself.

4 The sailor who put his head over the
side of a ship so he could get a wave in his
hair.

5 Future soldier who stayed up all
night studying for his blood test next day.
