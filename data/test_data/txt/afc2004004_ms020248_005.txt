         But they got to watchin' 'im.  I would carry breakfas' his in
the field to 'im, every mornin'.   He'd look at me comin' an'
jus' laugh.   You know?   We, we, we didn' know that he was       'till
afterwards.   Just laughin'.   Then would play wit' me, ya know.
He would tell me, ah, that I was a pretty lil' girl an' all kinda

love you, when you get a grown, a grown woman."   All kinda - -
Jus' talkin', you know, jus' teasin' me like that.   An' he,
he always want me to eat sumpin' with 'im, ya know.   I would
eat. . .An' so. . .He wa' a nice boy.   I had long hair.   He would
pick [at] up my hair:   "I'm gonna plait your hair one day."   I know
he 'bout one, you know, got used to that, you know.   "I want - -
Your Mama might not want me to plait your hair, though."   An',
you know, an' all like that, you know.   Just, he, he, he wanted
to play, hah.   Yeah, he said - - Yeah, 'cause he's a girl, anyhow.

        An' so he would go out with, with the boys around there, young
boys his age?   They [would] come an' get him, ya know, would be
friendly with him, an' let 'im go see the girls.   He'd go with 'im an' see
the girls.   Stayed late an' come home, he'd sot home laughin',
that boy would have, havin' that. . ."Bout how those girls was - -
nice girls.   He said, "Now, I wouldn't like such-an'-such a
girl.   An' such-an'-such a thing."   He would just talk.   "She,
tsk, no, I don't like, I don't like her.   Now such-an'-such a
girl, I think she'd make - - she's nice girl, she's ..."    You know,
'bout how the girls kiss him goodbye, an' would just laugh, you
know?   An' then, everybody, they was jus' crazy about 'im, too.
