ROUND AND ROUND HITLER’S GRAVE

I wish I had a bushel
I wish I had a peck
I wish I had old Hitler
With a rope around his neck.

Chorus: Hey! Round and round Hitler’s grave,
Round and round we go,
Gonna lay that poor boy down,
He won’t get up no more.

Mussolini won’t last long—
Tell you the reason why,
We’re a-gonna salt his beef
And hang it up to dry.

I’m a-goin’ to Berlin,
To Mister Hitler’s town,
I’m gonna take my forty four
And blow his playhouse down.

Old Rommel’s traveling mighty fast
but he’s on a single track,
He started down that Cairo road
But now he’s coming back.

The German Army general staff,
I guess they missed connection,
They went a hundred miles a day
but in the wrong direction.

Hitler went to Russia
In search of Russian oil,
But the only oil that he’ll find there
Is a pot in which he’ll boil.

I said to Joseph Stalin,
I told him for a fact,
You keep him busy at the front door
And we’ll march in the back.

I’ll tell you, Adolf Hitler
And all your thieving kind,
Takes just a five cent bullet
To ease your restless mind.

We’re rolling on through Africa,
To Italy or France,
No matter where we hit ‘em next
[They] haven’t got a chance.

I don’t care care exactly
Just where we go in
So long as the road we’re travelling
Leads right to Berlin.
