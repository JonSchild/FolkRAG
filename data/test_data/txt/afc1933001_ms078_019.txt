c/o PM

Dear Ben:

I notice with interest that you are now back in this country.
If you [h]appen to be Washington and would like to see me and Mrs.
Lomax, you can ring me at the Carrol Arms Hotel or the Music Division,
Library of Congress. We'll be in Washington for another
month or so.

I'm feeling somewhat grouchy for your failure to answer a
letter or two of mine. At the same time, I'm in a forgiving mood
and would enjoy buying you a lunch.

Sincerely your friend,

John A. Lomax
Honorary Curator and Consultant
Archive of American Folk Song
