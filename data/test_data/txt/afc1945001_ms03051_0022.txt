All you have to do to get a Commission or a Government job in Washington
is to have a hooked nose and a diploma from either Yale or Harvard. 
(Businessman)

The Higgins contract was canceled because Washington did not want the
South to have anything that big. (Overheard)

Negroes are certainly growing more defiant every day. (Farmer)

Memphis, August 11.
The Jews are running the country and will make it hard for any Gentile
in a position of authority.(Businessman)

Washington is in complete confusion. The Higgins affair and the run
around given Kaiser prove either confusion or incompetence. (Businessman)

Jews manage to dodge Selective Service. It would be interesting to see
statistics showing the proportionate number that have been inducted
into service. Those that are in the services have "swivel chair" 
commissions. They get what they want. (Civic leader)

The Administration is playing politics with Labor at the expense of
war production. (Overheard)
