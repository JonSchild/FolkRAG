Harold Hastings at dinner August 5 was told that a young 
chap from Detroit in the American Army in Australia had written home 
saying "If you want to know where I am look up Joe Doake's daughter."  
The family did and found her name was Adelaide.  The woman who told 
Hastings the story said she had heard it five times in the last few 
days.  [*Michigan (Aug. 3-8)  9*]
