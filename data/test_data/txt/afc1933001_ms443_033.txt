L.B. Speaks: This song was made about Mr. Henry Ford. There was
                      a woman, she drove up to his place of bus'ness one day - 
                      --- An' he didn' wan' no Chivvilays in his stock [An] an' 
                      she had a bran' new nice lookin' coup√© -- Chivallay. An' 
                      when she drove up there, she called Mr. Henry Ford an' 
                      he walked out. When he walked out, he laid his arm up
                      in her window of her coupe, an' she ask him for a trade. 
                      An' he looked at her an' her what he tol' her; 

L.B. Sings:  "Ah------ lady, won' you let me drive yo' Ford? 
                      Ah------ lady, won' you let me drive yo' Ford? 
                      Baby, I ain' no chauffer, but I can hold it in the road." 
L.B. Speaks:  She talked to him a long time. Atter she talk to him a 
                       long time, she couldn' make no headway. Atter she couldn' 
                       make no headway, she drove away. An' here what he 
                       tol' his friends: 
L.B. Sings:    "There was a woman owned a Chivillay, 
                       There was a woman owned a Chivillay, 
                       She been drivin' for ten years an' she hasn' had an 
                       acciden' yet." 
L.B. Speaks:  He goes back an' talk to his friends an' here what 
                       he tol' 'em: 
L.B. Sings:    "You can talk about your brick house, jus' ought to 
                      see my frame, 
                      You can talk about your brick house, jus' ought to 
                      see my frame, 
                      I don' take up no time wid no man an' a no-good jane." 
L.B. Speaks: He didn' take up no time wid no monkey-man* an' he didn'
