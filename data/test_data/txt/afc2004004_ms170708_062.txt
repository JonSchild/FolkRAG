Concernin' gold, as we are told,
It leads so many wrong.

That's the next two lines. (pause) That fair is a funny thing
now.
Kennedy: What's the story of it?
Cox: That there. . .Oh, it's about a sailor. (pause) About a
sailor. When he - the first words - when I left that
there - I can't think of 'em now for a minute. He went away,
you see. Young Emma, she was a servant maid,
. . .loved a sailor bold,
Who ploughed the main
Much gold to gain
His love, as we are told. (pause)

He went away an', eh. . .then he come back, an' her father kep'
a pub an' he, er, she told him to go there an' stop the
night, an' not tell him who he was. He robbed him that night
an' took all the money an' stabbed an' killed him an' took
him onto the beach an' - when she went to see where he was,
he had gone. He drowned him. Killed him. (pause) Ain't that
there now a funny thing. I know all the song. I can't think
o' that line, I can't think o' the first two lines now.
"Come all you feelin' lovers. . ."
Kennedy: I know there's one song I've never heard you sing
and that I'd like to hear. And that's the song you have about
in the room of a swan.
Cox: (laughs) Would you like to hear him?
Kennedy: It's a lovely song.
Cox: You got it on the record, ain't you?
Kennedy: No. We've heard it on a record, but we haven't
heard you sing it in person.
