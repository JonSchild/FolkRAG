de Big Baptizin'", a long-metered spiritual of the type
called "ol' one hundred"by the Negroes. The song was
swept toward the warm heavens by a host of voices as
Rev. Reese came to a halt in the pond about waist deep
and turned around.

When the song was ended, Rev. Reese asked Deacon
Haydon to pray. Deacon Haydon, a worker of the soil
for over three score years, his old black face lifted
toward the sky, began in a clear, mellow voice:

"Once mo', Our Father, we has come before you,
knee bent and body bowed, to thank you for yo' many
blessings. We knows, Our Father, dat you spoke an'
dis o'l worl' rolled into existence. We knows dat
you can jes' speak de word and dis ol' worl' will
roll into everlastin' night. We thank you, Our
Father, for watchin' over us as we slumbered and
slept last night. We thank you for tetchin' the
fields and woods wid yo' sunshine dis mornin' an'
bringin' dis sweet Sunday to yo' chillun.
"You heard our cries, Father, when we were too
mean to live and not fittin' to die. Now hear our
prayers as we ask you to guide our falterin' footsteps
through dis onfriendly world. Shed yo' blessin's on
these, yo' chillun, who have come down here to the
water's edge today to wash their robes and make them
white. Bless all under the sound of my weak voice,
