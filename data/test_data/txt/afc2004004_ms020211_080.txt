Dear Manny:

In reply to your letter of March 10, THE BUZZARD LOPE
has already been copyrighted by Lochrae Music, and I
will have them get in touch with you about the matter.

There is no reason why you should not acquire MY GOD
IS A ROCK IN THE WEARY LAND.  Perhaps later the group
will [decide] to instruct you to pay the royalties
to the whole group rather than Peter Davis, but that's
a small matter.  I will send this on to him for signature
to be returned to you.

All the best,

Alan Lomax
