Miss E. Barclay,
Buchanan Hostel,
Edinburgh.

Dear Miss Barclay,
Thank you for your letter and your signed
permission.

It would be a great help if you would send me
all the words of 'Da Bressay Lullaby' - how did you get
to know the song? Do you know at all, where it comes
from? It is a beautiful tune and I would like very 
much to know more about it.

I appreciate your kindness and help very much.

Yours sincerely,

Alan Lomax
