A     (continued) 
There was a man named Higginson from ah 
Chicago, who wrote essays about the spiritual
and wrote down the tunes, and we know what
the songs were that they sang then.  Songs much
like the ones that are still sung in the Sea
Islands - the first step in the growth of ah
an indigenous ah American Black music.  Ah, a
music that's still alive in the memories of
some of the old people there, and ah some of
the young ones too, because, ah, my friend
[*05 . 17. 45.08*]     Janie Hunter here, ah, who in a way
represents ah, what living for the heart,
living for love can do to keep you young,
until you're very old, Janie is ah - sings
those songs, ah, the songs that ah - for, for 
instance she knows ah one that you all probably 
have heard:  Michael row the boat ashore,
hallelujah, Michael row the boat ashore,
hallelujah.  One of the anthems of the Sea
Islands.  She has her own way of singing it.

[*05 . 18.  31 . 19.*]     Shall we put that in there?
