FEAR RUMORS

     In this category were listed rumors which seem to derive
from fears and anxieties associated with the war. Typical
rumors in this class concern horrors, exaggerated losses, etc.

Armed Forces -- suicides

Illinois -- The number of soldiers committing suicide in the
Army is enormous.

Illinois -- In one week at Parris Island, Ill. eleven recruits
committed suicide, driven to it by tough top sergeants.

New York -- When the order was given to go overseas, thirty
boys in Florida went out and hanged themselves.

     This is a typical war rumor, although at the moment it
does not have wide currency.

Armed Forces -- insanity in Army and Navy

Missouri -- Hundreds of boys who went insane at Pearl Harbor
are being held in the State Hospital in Alton, Ill.

New York -- According to the report of a sister of a Navy
officer, troop ships are so crowded that men go insane and
are thrown or jump overboard.

Michigan -- There is a large hospital at the Great Lakes Naval
Training Station filled with boys driven insane by the conditions
and environment of the Station.

     Although no instances are reported from New England, this
rumor is to be found in all other sections of America.

Armed Forces -- plagues and epidemics

California -- Ninety percent of the boys who were sent to
Iceland are now in Arizona being treated for T.B.

Michigan -- The men in Iceland get frozen lungs and then die
of T.B.

Washington, D.C. -- During one week, 3000 soldiers were sent
to the hospital following injections of vaccine. Sixty-two
ranking officers are already dead. They are trying to hush
up the whole affair.

     The South leads in this rumor. There are no reports of
this rumor from New England, although elsewhere in the nation
it is present.
