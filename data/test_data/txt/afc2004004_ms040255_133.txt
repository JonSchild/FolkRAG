REEL 8: Interview on Fourth Song (Donald J. MacKinnon. Barra)
"When she goes in full uniform
She looks spic and span with it
And he says there was not a soul in Europe
That would not be looking after her."
         
I was singing from the time I got out of the cradle
listening to the old fellow, my father

LOMAX:  Was he a famous singer?
DONALD: As famous as what was going, anyhow.
LOMAX: How many did he know?
DONALD: There must have been 300.
LOMAX: Did he sit you down on his knee and teach them?
DONALD: Yes, in the young days.
....Keeping watch in the hours of the night. That is when I do all my practice.
LOMAX: Do you sing just whatever comes in your mind?
DONALD: Oh, just whatever comes in my mind. I give them a run-over, four or five hours when on watch.
LOMAX: ... no objection.
DONALD: No, they all like them.
