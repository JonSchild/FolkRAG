DINK

vigorously on the wooden washboard, as she answered, "Some of dese
days I'm goin' to take all dat man's clothes and put 'em in dis wash tub and
get 'em good an' soakin' wet. Then I'm a-goin' to roll up dese wet clothes
in a bundle an' cover 'em up right nice in a de middle uv de bed. Smooth down
the covers, an' stick 'em all [inound? croungede?]  edges. Den I'm goin' on off 
up the river. And Dink Sang again:
          "  De worry blues an' bad, some folks say;
              Take a long freight train wid a red caboose to carry my worry
              blues away,
              When my heart struck sorrow, de tears come rolling down,
Suddenly she threw back her head and laughed a joyous, carefree laugh, and

          "  All you long-lived skinners better learn how to skin,

              Every big -- got to git on the road.

     A few months ago I inquired about Dink at Yazoo City, Mississippi, 
her home, she had told me. " Done planted up there", said a Negro woman pointing
to a nearby, tree-clad, hill. I could see a few slabs of marble shining
through the low green foliage. Dink once had sung me a spiritual about a 
lonesome graveyard with the refrain:
          "I wouldn't mind dyin', if dyin' was all"!
