Barry: He was very fond of music, but his background was just
people of the labouring kind. His father was in the army during the
1914-18 war.
Lomax: Did you and your husband travel round together in a caravan?
Barry: O yes. A acaravan, and we done terrible well. We followed
up the fairs - he used to make baskets out of sally rods. They grow
in woods and along the hedges, and he made baskets. I learned from
him. With the baskets and the singing we made a livelihood and done
terrible well. Can even make a basket yet, but you wouldn't get many
rods about this place.
Lomax: You sang as well?
Barry: Yes, I sang through the fairs and markets, and had very
enjoyable times. There was times when it was wet and rainy, knocked
around a little bit, but I enjoyed evry minute of it as well. Because
me heart was delighted when I went through the fiars and kept singing
all the time. Then it's not along I used to do that. As soon as I
finished up at a fair or market I used to go to some house, they knew
me that well. "Will you go up the house one night and play a few
tunes and sing a few songs?" And there I was. I used to go to the
house at eight o'clock in the evening, and from 8 till maybe 7 in
the morning, I'd be playing and singing all the time. Get a rest about
12 o'clock and a little bit of supper. Take away the furniture and
start off playing and dancing till 7 o'clock in the morning.
Step-dancing. Then while I'd get a little refreshment at 12, they'd
have a recitation. Everybody has to do a turn.
Lomax: This would be at a wedding or a wake?
Barry: No, no. It's actually what you call a sociable. They bring
you there and you play for them and got you a collection. They love
that sort of life. It's what they call "a house-celidhe.", and of
course, - it's only naturalenough- it's never without drink.
Lomax: Lots of drink?
Barry: O yes. Always. Even if it was 3 in the morning - if the
drink was gone, wasted, some two fellows would volunteer to get on
the bicycles and go down to Pollock's - that's the public house - 
and get a couple of sacks of Guiness. Just the same as a bag of
potatoes, and it doesn't rattle at the back of you in case anyone
should meet them, and they'd be back at the house just the same as
usual. Many a time I'd have a glass of Guiness down beside me, and
the banjo here, playing away, for sets, half-sets, and their
schottisches and all them, and I'd have the Guiness down beside me
there, and have to stop when the half set was over. And I'd come to
the part where I'd have to start all over, so it was take it and 
make the most of it. Drink it all back as quick as i possibly can.
And sometimes it used to upset me drinking it so fast. But I always
got the opportunity.
