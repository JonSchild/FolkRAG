I DON'T WANT NOBODY TO WORRY WHEN
I AM GONE

Composed by
SISTER MILLIE YOUNG,
Member of Union Chapel Baptist Church
Anguilla, Miss.

I am going to labor and toil for Jesus,
And do the best I can
I am going to hold up the blood stained banner
While traveling through this land.

Chorusâ€”
I don't want nobody to worry when
I am gone; when I am gone
I don't want nobody to worry when
I am gone;
When my eyes are closed in death,
And my soul will be at rest,
I don't want nobody to worry when
I am gone.

2
Now in my dying hour,
I will bid this world farewell,
And breathe my life out sweetly there
Then I am going where my Jesus dwell

3
Now every true believer
If you never hear me any more,
Just cast your care to Jesus,
And you will meet me on the other shore.
