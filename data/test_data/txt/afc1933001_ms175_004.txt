Mr. Alan Lomax
Library of Congress
Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Lomax:

   A letter from you addressed to "Lawrence W.
Chappel, University West Virginia, Huntington, West
Virginia," has recently been placed in my hands.  The
letter is dated July 2, 1941.  My name is not Lawrence,
but I suppose you meant the letter for me.  The letter
is a request for the opportunity to copy phonograph
recordings of folk-tunes for your archives.  As far as
I know I have the only phonograph records of such
materials in West Virginia, and so you must have had
my collection in mind.

   I have several hundred folk-tunes on metal
disks, made by the larger Lincoln Thompson machine,
the same type of machine you were using when I last
saw you at the Library of Congress.  My problem now is
one of transcription.  I need an expert male shorthand
writer and a male folk-tune expert.  If I had such aide
the chances of injuring my records would not be quite
so great.  But my plan is to publish my collection, and
I shall have to carry on as best I can, however slow
the pace.

   I have not decided as to what I shall do about
my disks after the songs are transcribed, but I suppose
duplicates might be made of some or all of them
eventually.  Of course I shall not be willing for copies
to be made before publication of the songs.

   I am glad to hear the Library is giving
more and more attention to the matter of folk-song
preservation.   Your own part in the enterprise is very
important.  Strunk was head of the music division when I
was last in the Library, but I understand that he is now
in Princeton.  I suppose that is correct.

Sincerely

L. W. Chappell
