IN ABRAHAM'S BOSOM

Two young Negros once had been on a wild rampage for a few days and
night and one of them had stolen a ham. The trail became so hot behind 
them that after ducking here and there for an entire day, they decided
to hide in an old church. It was night and the devout group of worshipers
were holding a prayer meeting. They crept in and sat down quietly on
the last row. Soon the minister came forward and began to extoll the
congregation on the sins of dishonesty and stealing and lying and etc.
The two Negroes say quietly, listening to everything that the minister said.
And they agreed with him. They hadn't meant to seal the ham, but temptation
had got the better of them, that's all. The minister finally chose 
his text from the Bible, namely, Abraham and His Flock of Sheep.
He exhorted and roared and the people began to moan and groan. After a while
he came to these words. And, "What had Abraham in his bosom", I says, What
had Abraham in his bosom. Don't you'll know what twas? No one dared to 
answer. The minister was trying to show that Abraham had only kindness for
all mankind in his heart. It so happened that one of the Negroes was named
Abraham and he had hidden the ham under his shirt, which made his stomack 
seem unusually large and full. He began to take the preachers words seriously 
and personally. He asked quietly of the other Negro. "Who he talkin'
bout? How he know I got a ham and how you 'spose he know my name Abraham?
The other one answered so that he couldn't figure out how the minister had 
become so wise, but he surely was  asking directly enough. Both sat back more
quietly than before. Again, came the thundering question. "I sez, what was 
it that Abraham carried around his bosom? Well, I'm a-gonna tell ya'.
Just then, the Negro could stand it no longer, his conscience go the better of 
him
