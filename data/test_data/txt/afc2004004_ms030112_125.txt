LIONEL:
Larry what was the story he told you.
LARRY:
Well, he was kind of giving me encouragement I, asked him one day how he come about playing and he told me he said that he was stumbling around in the house and he found one and when everybody come back in the house, they was all out in the fields doing something by the yard. He say when they came back he was playing like Hell. That was just a joke you know. But he had told me about the fireplace how he played like that.
MRS. DAVIS:
Well he told me he would stay around the house, he was blind but he said he would raise chickens and he said that he raised so many chickens he loved them so well, when he walked out in the yard he say they be coming on his head on his shoulders everywhere and he said after he made a living selling chickens and selling eggs he was lucky. He told me that a numer of times you know he was young.
LIONEL:
He told me that story too.
MRS. DAVIS:
I bet  he did. One thing about him he didn't forget things, you take me and in almost a year I forgot everything, but he carried all his music in his head and he didn't forget anything.  I don't know how he did it, but he did.
