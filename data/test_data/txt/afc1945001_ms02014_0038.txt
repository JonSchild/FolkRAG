From:  Field Representative, Montana
Subject:  Availability of Rumor Collectors for Future Studies

Attached are several rumors turned in by persons cooperating in the
rumor collection.  Following is a list of persons contacted to assist.

Dr. John J. Hall
403 Power Block
Helena, Montana
        Dentist.  Found work interesting and is willing
        to cooperate in future studies either for an
        indefinite period, specified week or as requested.

G. W. Millegan
831 Fifth Street
Helena, Montana
        Police Sergeant.  Showed interest.  Offered no
        suggestions or comments.  Will continue to
        collect rumors.

Mr. Tom Robinson
4 North Benton
Helena, Montana
        President of Lions Club.  Very interested.
        Suggested perhaps certain civic group might make
        rumor studies or surveys.  Willing to continue
        with rumor reporting as directed.

Mr. Sam Harshfield
5 West Sixth Avenue
Helena, Montana
        Proprietor of drug store.  Had nothing to report
        but will continue to assist in study.

Labor Union Official
(Mr. Ed Mason
President
State CIO Council
Butte, Montana)
        I was unable to make contact with a labor official
        connected with an industrial plant (East Helena
        smelter).  Mr. Ed Mason, State President of the
        CIO will assist and said he would mail rumors to this
        office.  Nothing has been received as yet.  Travels
        most of the time and is in Helena about one day each
        week.

Mrs. Esther Thomas
Fligelman's Shop
Helena, Montana
        Manager of Fligelman's Beauty Shop.  At first seemed
        very interested but seems to have lost enthusiasm.
        Therefore, I contacted Miss Gay Dobler, La Gay Beauty
        Service, 101 North Main, Helena, who will assist.

If people assigned to spot rumors for this study are furnished with unified
mimeographed forms and letters of instructions direct from Washington, the
results should be effective.
