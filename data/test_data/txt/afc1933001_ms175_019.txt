Dear Dr. Chappell: 

I hope you will forgive me for my mistake in addressing 
you as Lawrence W. Chappell. My recollection of names if often 
faulty, but I certainly did intend to write the man who is 
the author of "John Henry", and who was active in collecting 
West Virginia songs. 

It so happened that Lincoln Thompson came in my office 
the day before yesterday to demonstrate one of his new
machines, and he told me in passing that he thought you 
records were acoustically as good as any field recordings he 
had ever heard. That redoubles my concern and my original 
reason for writing you. We are both aware of the scientific 
importance of the actual, recorded rendition of the song, 
which sets forth better than any musical notation could possibly 
do the stylistic and melodic qualities of the piece. 
Once a good recording has been made, at the expense and pains 
that you and I both realize that such recording implies, it 
seems to me a great pity that the pristine quality of the 
recording be lost by wear and transcription. It was to 
prevent this that the Carnegie Corporation gave to the Library 
of Congress our duplicating laboratory, which was specifically 
set up to prevent the wearing out of our records,and those in 
the hands of private individuals, by continual replaying. By 
means of this duplicating laboratory the originals are stored 
away the [?] can be used for purposes of transcription. 
I hope you will seriously consider the possibility of having 
your records treated in this way before they are, as they will 
be, worn out in the publication process. 

There is another matter which I would like to take up 
with you. The Library of Congress is making up a set of 
records for distribution in Latin America, and this set of 
records will be distributed to all libraries and educational 
centers by the funds appropriated by the State Department. 
In view of what Lincoln Thompson said about the acoustic 
character of your records, I wonder whether you would not be 
interested in contributing one or two of your best songs to 
this set. At least, I should like the privilege of auditioning 
one or two of your most tuneful, best executed pieces for inclusion 
in this set.
