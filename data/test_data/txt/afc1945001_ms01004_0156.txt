Mr. Max Miller 
Office of Civilian Defense
17 Court Street
New York, New York

Dear Mr. Miller:

We have just been informed that your office is undertaking
a program for the collection, analysis, and interpretation of
rumors in your area. We here have considerable interest in the
study of rumors, and are trying, in fact, to keep abreast of all
of the local studies on this subject.

We, ourselves, have already undertaken a study of rumors
collected for the two-week period ending August 15th, and would
very much appreciate, if you think it possible, having whatever
conclusions you arrive at in your study. We will, of course, be
glad to exchange ours with you.

May we hear from you, describing the project you have under
way and the date of its probable completion.

Sincerely yours,

Eugene Katz
Chief, Special Services Division
