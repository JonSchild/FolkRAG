Guard at Ellis Island — "The doctor
treated him for yellow jaundice for five
years before discovering he was a Jap."

Mother to Father: "With all those
soldiers around, you'd better keep an eye
on her. Remember how you grabbed me in
1918."

Guard at Sheppard Pratt — "The doctor told
him he had a floating kidney so he went out
& had an anchor tattooed on his back."

Corporal (in the midst of his wedding ceremony) 
"Let me know when you come to a
good stopping place. I'm about to be A.W.O.L."

Corporal: "How would the world be without
its little joke?"
First Sergeant: "You wouldn't be alive."

Soldier — lovers don't go AWOL any more. To
them, it is now known a AWOL-fing.

Mary: "Marge would be different — she's 
going with a civilian."

Saw a newsreel where a father & seven 
sons are in the Navy. Every time they have a
meal they "pause for relation identification."

Clerk at the Travel Bureau: "You won't
have to cancel your trip, Mr. Jenkins.
We've made arrangements through the Navy
recruiting office."
