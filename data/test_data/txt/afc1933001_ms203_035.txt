It is regretable that Mr. Munson does not realize the essential
practicality of the Subject Index proposed in our last conference
in regard to the activities of the W.P.A. units in the Library 
of Congress. The Subject Index sampling that was proposed
would:

1. Make a great amount of important material at once available
to the Radio Project workers.

2. Would serve admirably to give the Writers Project Personnel
a sense of the scope, variety, and complexity of the
material which they will perforce be concerned with in the
Writer's Project files.

3. Give them a sense of values which they will decidedly need
in dealing with the Writers Project materials.

4. Give the whole project a more scholarly turn than it has
at present.

On the basis of Mr. Munson's Memorandum, I must inform 
Mr. MacLeish that my proposal to Mr. Evans Clark is hereby made
impossible of fulfillment.
