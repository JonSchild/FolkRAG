to bed. He's doin all right. I jes went back up to see bout him. He's 
sleepin now." An I say, "Are you  sure?" He say, "Yes. He set up all 
day till then. He prob'ly jes didn't wanna lay down cause his breath is 
kina short. I laid him down an put him to bed. He's all right." An I 
got the telegram about two o'clock. That he was dead. But they said he 
was talkin all right. He was talkin a little better. They was all right 
there with him. They say he died so easily. They was all right theah 
round the bed. But I don't know about that. Cause I think they jes didn't 
want to tell me. You know. How it happened. Cause you know when anybody 
is sick bad enough to die, Lizybeth, they pulse cannot be as narmal as 
ever. I'm sure they know that Huddie was much lower. From the time I

an they was givin him mo befo he died. The nurse said, "he jes went away 
an we didn't know it. I was standin theah holdin his arm. His pulse was 
the same." It's not so. It ain't so. That wadn't so, honey. It couldn't 
a been so. An they say he asked the student nurse to take the pillow out
