Frank Goodwyn

Frank Goodwyn's home [is] stands far out [of] from
Kingsville, Texas, among the mesquites. 
Frank [goes to College] studies English in
a State College in Kingsville.
He likes best to sing Mexican
Corridas which he learned while
working on the 3 million acre
King ranch. But I [ha] like best
the song he sang for me "The
Dying Cowboy", though when [faced] facing
[with] the microphone he became
too stiff and self-conscious. Even at
that compare [him] his singing, to that of the goo-goo
Gene Autry, and you will
realize the difference between 
the true and false metal.
One learned his songs in the saddle
