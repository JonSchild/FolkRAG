Denison Sunday.

Kind Friend,
Thought I would get down that way over the
week end but couldn't get away.  Always had plenty of
hands before that could carry on with things but haven't
got them now and can never tell what is coming up.

We are fixing up some rent houses also and
it is a job to keep up with that while the nursery
selling season is going on also.  Am trying to get all
the farm land sowed down but 30 acers in cotton and 
corn so I can hand;e that. Won't have the pasture on
the river another year as they will be flooded this
summer for the lake. If I am down. that way during the
week I am going to call you. I am practising those
songs but am having a hard time getting a famalier 
yell to them. Want to try it thou and want you to
help me out some. You might beat me at it.
