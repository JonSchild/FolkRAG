Jan 27th on road to Killarney
-Out of jungle the valleys -
ivy lichen - barren hills
purple [?] , sheep den green
grass - swirls of snowy Alps
but low only 1500 ft high -
green in the valleys.  The
sky above the mountains is
the same color as the lines
on this paper.

Part the town of [Kennare?] (for
tweeds) and over the mts into the 
Kilarney Lake Country.  Jungle of
holly, twisted birches extending
a haze of violet branches into
the white winter air and
empurpling it - maze of moors
around roads, barren masses
of dead fern, the road twisting
running crags & then a view of
a snow covered mountains , cloud
Capped & below the steel
