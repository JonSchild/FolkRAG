We have put in a lot of time while 
waiting, copying song manuscripts 
for the Library and attending to 
the longer correspondence that seems 
inseparable from this work. Meanwhile 
we have made progress in Louisiana, 
have spent a week each in two hitherto 
unreached prison camps centers in 
Texas and are now on our second 
visit to the Rio Grande region trailing 
Texas - Mexican Folk Songs. (The 
floods drove us out on our first 
visit before we had covered the
field). We have made several other trips to 
smaller groups.

As yet we have not been bidden 
back to the great King ranch, managed 
by Robert Kleberg, brother to Richard Kleberg, 
the Texas Congressman, and an heir to this 
property. Mr. Robert Kleberg, although he 
proposed to have us back to the spring
