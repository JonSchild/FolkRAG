[*(CARE OF 1ST BABY)*]
AL:      Bessie, how did your mama instruct you on how to take care
of your baby when she was born?  I mean, you didn't know anything
about takin' care of babies?
BJ:       No-o.  She jus' tol' me.
AL:      What were you?  11 or 12?
BJ:       I was between 12 and 13.  She didn' ah. . .She, she tuk care
a me an' showed me how.  Tha's all.
AL:      Well, I mean, did she believe that you should let the baby
cry itself out or pick it up?
BJ:       O-oh, no.  Pick it up when it's young.  'Cause it cry too
much when it young, see, that ruin it navel.
AL:      What?
BJ:       Make it have a big navel.  Put too much wind in it navel.
TL:       If they cry too much they get a big navel?
BJ:       When they real young.  Put too much wind in they navel. Um-hum
. . .That's why we had to keep 'em nursed then.  But after the
navel, you know, grow up an' be healed up, then you, if you know,
if you know he ain't nothin' ailin' 'im, you can let 'im cry
a while.   See?   An' that's make 'im have strong lungs. . .Put a win'
in it. . .You know?  But not jus' to let 'im do it jus' for suffocatin' 
[there] now.   What I mean, don't grab 'im every time he holler
all the time.  [*(SPOILING)*] You gonna have him hand ruint.  He'll be ruint to
your hand.  Every time he holler jusâ€™, just for you to hold 'im.
You can't do anything; ya can't wash ya dishes; ya can't do
nothin'.  Ya git 'im trained that - - Ya know, give 'im sumpin'
to play with an' -- you know -- tend to 'im.  Give 'im sumpin' to play with; 
see to it bein' dry an' everything.  An' know he not hongry.
And then you can jus' let 'im go on.  An' some-sometime he lay
there [an' whine] a while, "Ya, ya, ya," an' so fall to sleep.  Go right 
on to sleep.  He gettin' used to it then.  Just so's you know
