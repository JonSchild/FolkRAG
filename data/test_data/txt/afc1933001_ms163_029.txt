From: Alan Lomax                                              November 19, 1940

To: Dr. Spivacke

Dear Dr. Spivacke:
     There are in the Archive of American Folk Song forty-
nine (49) records made in Indiana with the help, in part, of
the Indian Folk Lore Society and the W.P.A Writers Project.
The records contain ballads in English and French and a group
of German-Amish hymns. The serial numbers are 1719-1767.

                                                   Thank you,

                                                   Alan Lomax
