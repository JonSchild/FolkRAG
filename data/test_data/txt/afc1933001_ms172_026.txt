Dear Mr. Fisher:

I should like to know by return Air Mail 
Special Delivery exactly what the Golden Gate 
and myself are supposed to do in Mexico City. 
I want to get my part translated into Spanish 
and read it in that language, so give me one 
or two days to prepare, please.

Also let me know as soon as possible about 
Leadbelly - if he is in condition to go or whether 
it will be necessary to get Joshua White as a 
substitute guitarist. This had better be settled 
at once as I told you.

Before I leave Washington, I shall send you 
a forwarding address, but I shall be here until 
Wednesday.

Sincerely yours,

Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge of the
Archive of American Folksong
