Dear Dr Lomax,

I regret the delay in answering your letter, but this has only just reached me.  It had been sent to a wrong address.

The only archives of authentic Gaelic folksong recordings in existence are mine and that of the Linguistic Survey of Scotland (under Professor Angus McIntosh, Edinburgh University).  As I have made 365 folksong recordings in the Outer Hebrides on wire during the past 12 months there would be no difficulty at all in providing any material needed from my collection, so long as the singers consented; but as my collection is made in a limited (although the richest) district it might be better if I consulted with Professor McIntosh regarding suitable items he might have from other districts for inclusion.  I may say I expect to record many more songs yet, if all goes well.

The types of song that should be represented are

Ossianic ballads
Waulking or "milling" songs
Orain mhora or narrative songs
Love songs
Lullabies & other songs for children
Port a bial or sung dance music

The first two types have the most archaic kind of airs

I enclose a recent publication showing how the words might be treated.

One stipulation I must make is that these recordings are published as part of a Scottish collection and not as part of a "United Kingdom" or "British" collection.  There is no such thing as "British" folksong, indeed it is on the folklevel that Scottish national characteristics are most strongly maintained.  I assume you are dealing with
