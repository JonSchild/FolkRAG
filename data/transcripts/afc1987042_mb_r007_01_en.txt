[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000] How do you get the money to do these?
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000] In part, it's from the Library of Congress.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000] Okay.

[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000] The city gave it to her.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000] Who was that?
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000] Her name is Ruth Page.

[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000] Yeah.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000] I thought maybe I shouldn't say this but I just understand.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000] It's a creative.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000] Yeah, because it's the creative.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000] I think it is creative in a sense.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.240] Make your work, then someone can make it able to provide it to myself because Cute 임
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.480] would know. He know about it.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:36.640] Yeah well I'm interested in like I'm asking you about traditional Lao culture
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:49.480] what it's like here how it's changing. Okay. I do understand that. What you think will happen eventually to the community.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:03:00.960] I think we're talking a long comedy they have to sooner or later they will write up everything you know.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:12.280] Like be a make a way sooner or later they have to do it if they would like to stay in here for good.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.580] Some things will you think they will keep some customs though?
[00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.080] Religion or?
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.380] Religion.
[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.460] Religion. Or?
[00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:25.460] Maybe some dance, food, I don't know.
[00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:38.160] I think the food they will keep the same way you know because more and more the people come and then more and more the food coming from different places.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:47.260] Even they can grow in here the food, the food to eat. I don't think it will change the foods.
[00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.360] What are some of the foods you talk about?
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:59.360] Like the food we cook every day you know like a day to day.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.360] What are some of those foods?
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.360] We talking about vegetable that don't happen here.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.360] Like what?
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.360] The American people never eat it.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.360] What vegetables? Can you give me the names?
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:18.360] Ah. Hmm. I don't have that name though but the smell.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.360] Okay.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:30.360] We have like a queer thing you know we making with the special thing with the food that we make like a raw meat you know which is cut like small pieces.
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:40.360] And they didn't even cook it. They just put sauce, pepper and with the whole bunch of vegetables.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.360] So we'll go with a certain kind of thing you put in there and then we eat it.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.360] But you don't have the vegetables here? You can't get them in the market?
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.360] You can't buy it from the supermarket.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:59.360] You have to go into the Asian store. Asian market store.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.360] Things like noodles or bean sprouts?
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:12.360] Yeah. Like some kind of thing. Noodles. And they have to get a certain kind of thing. They come from Thailand.
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.360] Yeah.
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.360] Before they can eat it. They won't eat the noodles. They sell in the supermarket.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:26.360] So you think more people are buying food from the American supermarket and cooking?
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.360] Yes. Yes.
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.360] Still cooking in old ways though or?
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.360] Still cooking in the old way.
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.360] But using American vegetables?
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:40.360] Yes. But they have to buy a certain kind of vegetable from the large store.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:46.360] Usually, see every week they go to the supermarket like everybody else.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:56.360] And then they're going to end up going to the Asian market store to buy certain things to cook with.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.360] Right.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:07.360] What other things do you think will, of Lao culture will stay the same?
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:14.360] I think the language will stay. And the food will stay.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:28.360] And I don't think the religion will last any longer.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.360] Really? The Buddhism?
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:39.360] Yeah. Because they teach people to hike up old ways, you know.
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.360] And then...
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:51.360] It's hard to make people believe what they're saying. You have to know what they're talking about.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:07:02.360] If you go in there, the temple, you have to learn special words, you know, before you can be able to understand the monk was talking about.
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:09.360] I think they feel hard though. And they're not going to go in there, sit an hour, and an hour listen to it.
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.360] Are there, are many people going to Christian churches?
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.360] Yes. Yes.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.360] Which churches are?
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:23.360] I think it's St. Peter's.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.360] Catholic?
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.360] St. Patrick's Church.
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.360] St. Patrick's. It's a Catholic church.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.360] Yeah.
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.360] In the acre.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.360] Yeah, in the acre.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:40.360] So many people are going to Christian church?
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.360] To be honest with you, okay.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:55.360] In my idea, I think if they go to the church, they need to get help from the church. Like, they don't have a place to stay.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.360] Right.
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:04.360] Or if they have a problem, they will have somebody, real guidance on what to do.
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.360] Right.
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.360] That's why they go to the church.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:12.360] But some families, they keep going every Sunday.
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.360] Yeah.
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:26.360] Do you think the respect for elders and the importance of family and discipline, will that change?
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:31.360] Become more like, more freedom like American families?
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:38.360] I, hard to say though, but it will stay.
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.360] You think so?
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.360] I believe, yeah. I believe.
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.360] Okay.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.360] I think the people, they're born with that thing.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:50.360] They will give another respect to their own people.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:56.360] Because they're still talking their own language.
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:02.360] And I know it, even though the young, they can't understand English right now.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.360] When they're growing up, they will pick it up.
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:10.360] They will know how to speak, how to speak loud in English.
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:15.360] Even though they didn't go to school, how to speak loud.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:20.360] They will, they will know automatically.
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:28.360] Are there problems with other groups?
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:33.360] Between Lao and other, other groups in the city?
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.360] I...
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.360] Is this someone you know?
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.360] Okay, uh...
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.360] They can wait.
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.360] But...
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.360] Uh...
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.360] No, no.
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:54.360] We get along with the community, Cambodian community.
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:10:00.360] And we have small Vietnamese community in this area.
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.360] What about the non-Asian community?
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.360] Hispanic or Irish?
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.360] Other?
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.360] We never have that problem with them, though.
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.360] Really.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.360] We talking, general thing.
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.360] We not talking like a small thing, you know.
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.360] Right.
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.360] In general?
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.360] Yeah.
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.360] We never have that problems.
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:28.360] I think, uh, this city, this area, they love the Asian people.
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:33.360] I think, especially the media, you know.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.360] The city council, they understand it.
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.360] And then, what?
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:48.360] They realize it, the, uh, Asian community, they, they don't, they, they don't make a
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.360] trouble, you know.
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.360] They won't give a city trouble.
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.360] Right.
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:55.360] And they all working, not like a Hispanic community.
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.360] Mm-hmm.
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.360] Don't selling like a drug or something.
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.360] Killing, stealing thing.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.360] Mm-hmm.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.360] People think, you know, we never do that.
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.360] Mm-hmm.
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:15.360] I don't know about the Vietnamese community, but talking the Cambodian and Lao, we never
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.360] have that problems.
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.360] Mm-hmm.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.360] How, how large is the Vietnamese community?
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.360] Smaller than the Lao?
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.360] Really small.
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.360] Yeah, small.
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.360] I think, uh, about two or three fam- uh, two or three hundred family.
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.360] Mm-hmm.
