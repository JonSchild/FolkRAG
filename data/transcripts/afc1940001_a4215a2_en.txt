[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180] Just sing it, just sing it.
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:13.800] The sun had sank behind yon hill across yon dreary moor.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.980] There came a lad most dreary and sat up to a farmer's door.
[00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:28.380] And he says, says he, if any there be where I could find employer
[00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:38.280] for to plow or to sow, to reap or to mow, or to be a farmer's boy, a farmer's boy.
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:46.360] My father is dead, my mother is left with four poor children small,
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.960] which makes it bad for mother, yet I'm the eldest.
[00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.540] I'm the eldest of them all, but still I would labor as hard as I can
[00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:03.100] if I can find employer for to plow or to sow, to reap or to mow,
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.760] or to be a farmer's boy, or to be a farmer's boy.
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.440] We'll try the lad, the farmer said, no further we'll let him seek.
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.880] Oh yes, oh yes, his daughter cried as the,
[00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.780] his ears rolled down her cheeks.
[00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.080] And the lad that was here is a mossback still, and oft times he will say,
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:38.620] what a happy, happy day when I came this way to be a farmer's boy, to be a farmer's boy.
