[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640] But I enjoy quilting, that's why I do it. If I didn't enjoy it, I wouldn't do it.
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.840] But I get tired of it sometimes when it takes me months to quilt a quilt.
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.440] And some of my neighbors can't understand that it takes me three weeks, a month, two months
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.400] piece of quilt. They couldn't understand it till I, they saw some of my quilts and then
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:29.840] they understood why it took me so long to, to piece, to quilt a quilt.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.160] Thousands of stitches go in.
