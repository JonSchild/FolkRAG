[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000] Do you want to say what your address is here?
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:15.000] Fuller, Utah, through 318.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000] Oh, here in Aback.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000] Yeah.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000] Spell the name of the dorm.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:28.000] W-A-L, I mean, wait, F-U-A-L-W-O-O-D.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000] Okay. Okay. And where were you born?
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000] I was born in Atlanta, Georgia.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:46.000] Okay. I was trying to think what else I could ask you. The music that you play, it's not really blues.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000] No.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000] It's not really rock music either.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000] No.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000] So it's just really your style, isn't it?
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:00.000] Well I really couldn't say my style. I could say it's a copy of somebody else, but I play with feelings.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000] But it's my style.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000] Okay.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000] So it's not my style. I haven't developed my style yet. I'm just copying somebody else.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000] Who are the main people that you think influences you?
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000] Lee Oscar.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000] Yeah. Right.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000] I grew up with the Ab. I can tell you the first Ab they made. I can play everything he play on the Ab.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000] I used to work with him.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000] Sure.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000] They used to write down the street for me. And so you know, it's satisfying for him from California.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000] Yeah. I like that latest album.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.000] Oh yeah. They have two. Sunshine LA something.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000] LA.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000] And Magic Mountain. Even Bergen came back. He's on that old Ab.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000] That's right.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000] Magic Mountain, that's another copy. But that new one, he's not on there.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000] That's right. He's not on that new one.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000] Yeah. I know a lot about him.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000] LA is a funky town. I like the beat to that.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000] But he didn't come from the United States. Lee Oscar, he came from Germany.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000] Yeah, he's from Germany.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000] Denmark or somewhere.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000] Is it Germany? I know he's from Europe.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000] He's from Germany.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000] Is he from Germany?
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000] Yeah.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:23.000] I used to write letters and stuff when I was in high school. I don't know why. I used to write all kinds of old fan letters.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.000] They'll write me back. I found the address and everything. I wrote about two or three times.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000] I go to all the concerts when they come home.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:40.000] I go to them. And when they came downtown to play at the Central Park, I saw them there.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000] War?
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000] Yeah. I see them all.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000] Now War isn't from Georgia.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000] No, they're not from Georgia, but they have concerts.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000] Oh yeah, right. I was going to say, they're from Los Angeles.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000] Yeah.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:59.000] That's out of sight. That's out of sight. No, most of them, they don't write back.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000] No, they don't. He didn't write back.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:11.000] They really don't. Well, when you play like with the guy that plays guitar, how, you know,
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:29.000] Well, then I'd be kind of using my style. I mean, I have the artist playing for me. You know, I have his pattern playing, but I can put my feelings in it and rearrange it. You know, like Tar plays guitar. We'd be in the same key.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000] Yeah.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000] And my harmonica would be in the same key with the guitar. Then, you know, I'd just put a little something in there.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000] Maybe I should try to get the two of you together.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:55.000] Yeah. Good. He said he'll be around here about something about five, maybe five o'clock, six. I think he would. But Van, he's real good. He's white though. I don't know all the guys I know, they're white.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000] Uh huh. Well ain't that many blacks playing in Arvada?
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000] No.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000] Believe it or not.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000] No.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:12.000] No, there really isn't. I tell you that as a fact, because I know like, I wish I had brought this album up, I would have played it for you. It's a black man, Charlie Sayles.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:20.000] That's the guy I was telling you about. And Charlie Sayles is one of the few blacks that I know that's playing harmonica. And he wrote a book on how to play the harmonica.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:28.000] I used to have E-step albums, you know, E-step books, but I just didn't really learn from that. I used to read up on it, but.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000] Charlie wrote his own book, because he said he thought that the books they had weren't good at all.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:40.000] And the music teacher in high school, he couldn't show me how to read notes or nothing, because he didn't know nothing about the harmonica. He was a music teacher.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000] Right.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:56.000] So like, we had a talent show, and I had to play. We played Slippin' in the Dark, and you know, I had to learn by records. And the guys had to, the teacher had wrote them the music, you know, like it was me, a dude playing saxophone, I was blending with the sax.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000] Uh huh.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:07.000] And the music teacher had to get us together. Well, he had to listen to the record too, but he mostly wrote some of his music. And everybody was doing the singing and stuff, I'd sing a little bit.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:17.000] And it was kind of a mess though. It was hard on me, because see, I couldn't read no music, and they could. See, he used to write everything and tell me to listen, or just put in something.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:26.000] See, I didn't really want to put in, I just wanted to play exactly like it was on the record. We did it. And it was smashing. Everybody was highly going on, clapping.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000] It was alright, huh?
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000] When I played in ABAC, oh, now a lot of these white folks got to know me, you know. I felt like a star.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:45.000] I'll tell you something, like Charlie always tells me, you see, when you play somebody else's music, you're copying them, and they're already established.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000] Yeah.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:54.000] But when you do your own thing, can't nobody copy you, you understand what I'm saying? Then it's all you, and it's all you out there doing your thing, you know.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:06.000] But I look at the harmonica as a, I mean, I listen to every other kind of harmonica player. When I listen to Lee Oscar playing, when I listen to his playing, it's good.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:14.000] When I listen to another person playing, it sounds like him, but it's just different music in the background. I mean, harmonica to me blow by the same.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.000] I mean, it's only about two styles really to me on the harmonica. Three, jazz, blues, and what I play.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000] Like Steven Wonder, he plays, I don't know, I can't claim.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000] Yeah.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:31.000] I don't know, I can't classify that. He plays something like blues and jazz and the type. A little soul, you know.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:39.000] But all harmonica sounds the same to me. The only thing that makes Lee Oscar stand out so good is the music.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000] He stands out good, but the music, I can't explain it, but to me harmonica sounds the same.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:52.000] I think that Lee Oscar stands out because of the band, because as a harmonica player, what he does, it's not that exceptional.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000] Yeah.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000] It's not that difficult.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000] No, no. Not the kind of music he's playing.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:05.000] Not the kind he's playing. But if you listen to some of like the old harmonica music, particularly like Sonny Boyd Williamson and them,
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:16.000] maybe what they did, it was too gold. And I was in Tennessee, in Memphis, yeah, about four weeks ago, three, four weeks ago down there,
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000] and I met a guy named Sonny Blake. This guy blew harmonica in a way that it blew me out.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000] I couldn't even believe it myself.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:32.000] We had a guy back home who played extremely good. It was his style, he said, but I never heard nobody play like he do.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000] Played real good. He used to walk up down the street, blow the harmonica, you know, everywhere he went, he played.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000] He played, he'd come about and play. He'd go across the street over somebody else, play. Just play anywhere he went.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000] Really?
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.000] Yeah, the dude, well I ain't gonna say he was kind of off a little bit, but he loved playing. He played for everybody.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000] Children?
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:58.000] He was about 22, 23, yeah. He had got out of prison, you know, he just played all the time.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000] Every time I see him he's playing at the park, entertaining everybody.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:11.000] You know, and me, we sit around and talk, you know, he'd tell me that, you know, he thought while I did, acting kind of shy, you know,
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:20.000] I don't blow outside and play around with people. The only time I could really express myself was when I'm on stage or just playing with a record.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000] As far as that, that's nothing.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:35.000] Well, you don't know anybody else around in this area that plays anything, do you? Especially black musicians, do you?
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:41.000] Miller Brooks? He hasn't, what's the, he played in the West Carolina, Turner, one of them.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000] Yeah, wasn't that the name I got last night, Miller Brooks?
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000] Yeah, Thomas Miller Brooks.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000] He's staying at Osceola?
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000] Mm-hmm.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000] Excited to look them up.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000] Mm-hmm.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000] Piano and guitar.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000] Piano, guitar, bass.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000] Yeah.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000] Sings real good.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000] Yeah.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:07.000] But I never heard him play no blues, but I imagine he could probably, it's possible, you know, he's more into disco than Miller Brooks.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:14.000] I mean, he'll listen, he'll listen to records, he'll go to the chapel, play the piano, and he'll sound just like playing the piano singing.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000] He's real talented.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000] Yeah.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000] I don't know, I don't know too many black players who do all that.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000] They just play ball a lot.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000] As far as I know.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000] That's it, yeah.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000] That's it.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000] Well, okay.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000] Maybe this evening, I hope I'll be here.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000] I didn't disappoint you, though.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000] No.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000] Oh, no.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000] No, no, very, very.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000] I found it very, very, very, very good.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000] Nuh-uh.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000] You know, you did not disappoint me.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:16:03.000] Only thing that I hope is that one day that you'll get to the point that you won't have to just depend on records to play or to be on stage.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:11.000] On stage is cool, but that you don't have to just depend on records so that you can come into your own and play what you want to play.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:17.000] Well, that's, yeah, when I first came out here, the group played, you know, and I asked them, could I play with them, you know.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000] And they told me to play something.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000] I just played anything.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000] They liked it.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000] They said they were going to find a cut for me to play with them.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000] I got up.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000] It was blues, really.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:31.000] It was blues type of music, but I managed to have the right, come on the right key with the music.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000] And so I just got Caterwell on stage just playing my head off.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000] Everybody heard just how it was going on, clapping.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000] All the white folks asking me my name, where I come from, offering me Cater, beer, everything.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000] Really?
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000] Yeah.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000] And I played over here at the gym.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000] Second quarter, same thing happened there.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000] And the music teacher here wanted me to play in the jazz band.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000] I played.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000] But he couldn't help me because he didn't know nothing about it.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:08.000] And when I used to get up and play, they played horns now, hitting sharps and flats, and I'm hitting natural notes.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:14.000] And when I was playing, he said, it sounded good, it sounded good, but to me it sounded terrible.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000] I heard my ear terrible.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:22.000] And he told me I was out of pitch, and the band kept telling me to play.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000] I mean I can't do that.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000] No, if you're out of pitch, you're just out of pitch.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:33.000] The thing is, is that the only sharps and flats that you're ever going to find totally on a harmonica is on the chromatic.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000] Yeah.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000] And I'm going to learn how to play that too.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:43.000] I'm going to buy me an E-step book, and over the weekend, when I have plenty of time to mess around, definitely get me a chromatic.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000] I said I was going to buy me one.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000] But do you understand like if they play it in the key of C, what harmonica it is that you need?
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:55.000] Yeah, well if they play it in the key of C, maybe I have to play a harmonic in F, G.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000] Right, okay.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000] It's like transposers.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000] Yeah.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000] See, because you got that part, that whole thing is down, right.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:10.000] See a lot of people tell me, I know when I was back home, and it was due with grips, you know, when I tried to play with them, they thought I couldn't play.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000] It wasn't that.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000] I just can't get a harmonic.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000] One harmonic cannot play everything.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000] One harmonic cannot play every song.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:26.000] When they asked me to do that, and my harmonica did not play with their music, or did not, you know, went in the same pitch, I'd be trying to explain it to some people and they just don't seem to understand.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000] Right.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000] They think I couldn't play.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000] But you know, it wouldn't bother me as long as I know what I can do.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000] Yeah, yeah, no, no, it depends on what harmonica you have, you know.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000] And I hate to play, and I know I'm out of tune.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000] The teacher's going to tell me to keep on playing.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000] I know that I got the ear for it.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000] I can hear myself and what's right and wrong in the music.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000] And he's going to tell me to keep on playing.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000] I didn't have a two harmonic, I had a D and a G.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:05.000] And the music they played, the keys could not even, the music they played, I could not even be in the same key with them because every music they played was in different keys.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000] My harmonica couldn't match them.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000] Yeah, because that makes all the difference in the world.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000] It really does.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:18.000] I wish I had one of those tapes here so you could, I could play one of those tapes.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000] I don't have any other ear with me.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000] I have something like about 300 tapes in all.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000] Of harmonica playing?
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000] Nothing but harmonica music from all over the country.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000] You do?
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000] Uh huh, that's all I got collected.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000] I don't count this part of you anyway though.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.000] No.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000] I feel like I have.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000] I just thought I would get you to do some more some other time.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000] I said, no.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000] You didn't disappoint me.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000] Not at all.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000] See, first they had already told me that you were very shy.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000] I had already got the word on you.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000] Did you close my door?
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000] Yeah, I closed it.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000] Okay.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000] It's not locked like that.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000] They had already told me that and I knew that I was putting you in an awkward situation.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:07.000] But since I'll be here a while, hopefully you'll be able to get some kind of comfortability where you, you know.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000] I believe if I had a door, I'd be able to get in.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000] Yeah.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000] That's what I needed a couple of keys.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000] That's what a D key is for.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000] That was the other thing I was going to say.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:19.000] Really, a D, when you said D, when I was there, I said a D harmonica, I don't know.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000] Now I mean, D flat maybe, I don't know, you know.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:28.000] I mostly can really play on F, F and A. A is a good blues harmonica.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000] Yeah.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000] But you know, I know how much harmonicas cost.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000] I don't know if they sell them for a year or so.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:45.000] I used to play every chance I get.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000] Do you ever sing and play?
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000] Sing? Yeah. Every once in a while.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000] Like what songs?
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:07.000] I just sing. I have records and stuff. That too. But just singing.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:14.000] I sing Deliver the Word. A lot of disco stuff.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000] But I can sing blues. Me and Tom, Tom's so much into blues.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:24.000] When I be around him, that's all I listen to, blues. I can't argue with it. That's his style.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000] So I go over there, we sing a little bit, play.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:34.000] He used to have a little amplifier where he'd take me singing.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000] My voice would come out of the amplifier. It sounds pretty good.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000] And I'd blow it up.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000] I'd blow the harmonies, he'd play the guitar.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000] All right.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000] Stuff like that. Kind of kid around.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000] Well maybe if he's coming home this afternoon, maybe if he's not busy, you can come too.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000] Yeah, I'll come.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:56.000] I guess I'll be here. I'm not sure. I've got to go to a cell at some point, you know,
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000] trying to see if they can find this Middlebrook and this lady.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000] Wait, what's the guy's name again?
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000] Thomas Middlebrook.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000] I got to, I'm trying to...
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000] I don't know his address, his phone number. Joyce knows me.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000] Yeah, well that's all right. She even gave me the number. I wrote it down last night.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000] And what's Joyce's last name?
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000] Is it Hyman?
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000] Yeah, Hyman.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.000] But that would be good because I'd like to get some more.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000] But I don't want to push you because I know that that's not right either.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000] And I don't know if you'll be able to get any other Hyman because I mean...
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:47.000] Well I can ask Tom to let me play, but I depend too much on other things.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:54.000] You know, I just feel, I have, it's just I can remember, I played with rappers and stuff, played with little groups,
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:00.000] and I just never really see myself sitting down in a room and just playing.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000] I have taped myself, but I stopped.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000] Uh huh.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000] Because I didn't like what I heard.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000] To me, it's not me on tape.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000] Well...
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000] I can hear a lot of mistakes and I be trying to improve the mistakes I hear.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000] Right, that's what I'm saying. See, but you are your worst critic and that's what's really nice,
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000] that you can get a good tape when you can really, really hear it, you know?
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000] I mean like as you can see, this tape picks up your breathing.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000] Oh yeah.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000] Everything.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000] You know anything about the whole history thing in terms of harmonica?
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000] The whole history terms?
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000] Yeah, I mean the history, like, I mean harmonica in this country?
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:44.000] Hmm. I know a little bit about it.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:50.000] Okay, because you know, I didn't know if you knew it or not. This is a...
