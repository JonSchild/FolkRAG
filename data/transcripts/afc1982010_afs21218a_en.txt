[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.140] ...tremendous territory. In fact, the business reached, according to history,
[00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:14.400] from the old mortgage to the Flint, just about. And I believe we went to Grady on the south and
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:22.960] Pulaski on the north. Consequently, Ware, and oh, I could just start naming them as they'd come to
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:33.400] me, all these other counties had been created since then. Well, Irving took in all the Fitzgerald.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:47.180] Wilcox was created then. Then after the Yankee boys wanted to form that colony up there,
[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.940] what was first known as Swan, later Fitzgerald, a man from Fitzgerald came,
[00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.060] who was highly honored, highly thought of, and they named the city for him. So they went along
[00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:09.080] for some time under Irving County, don't you see? But so many of them, they got tired of coming
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.260] down here. I'll go back to the old courthouse at Irvingville now a little bit, when it was the
[00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:22.840] county seat. The first court that was ever held in Irving County was held at the home of the state
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.920] of Irving. And it was the state of Irving. And it was the state of Irving. And it was the state
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.520] of Irving. And it was the state of Irving. And it was the state of Irving. And it was the state of Irving. And that's way up
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.960] down in Wilcox County on the upper side. We had thirteen district, militia districts in the county,
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.000] I believe, at that time. And they tried this man for hog stealing or something of those. Just a few
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.160] of them, I think, went in at his home and tried that out. Nevertheless, that didn't amount to
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:46.000] anything. They moved it around, then finally went over to old Isabella with it. That's about, we'd
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.980] say, the third place. You could hardly call it a county site, just for a little while. So then,
[00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.820] they saw that it was not a county site. They saw that it was not a county site. They saw that it
[00:01:52.820 --> 00:02:01.360] was located to where it was accessible to the ones that were in Irving. So they agreed then to move it to
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:08.040] Irving on lot 41 in the third land district for Irving County. And the first set that we had in the record
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:21.020] of in lot 41 at Irving was B.B. Ransom. So they got together and they agreed on the site, out of site,
[00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.720] and they cut the lots of it.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.720] It's, it's, it's, the record reads it should extend a quarter of a mile each way from the home of B.B. Ransom.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:36.940] Now, right where B.B. Ransom's home was, I don't know. So then they built a log courthouse, or a courthouse.
[00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:47.880] They built a log jail. And from there, it stayed for years and years, as history will prove it here and down there as well.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.840] And so,
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:03:02.720] this side of the county was becoming rather thickly populated. So, O'Sullivan was growing.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:10.720] And that out there, it's true, and they were my dear and dear relatives. They owned the majority of those things.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.720] Judge Clementine, my wife, Walter, did have a tremendous body of land. My wife was a clerk at the court.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.720] The court and judge was the first graduate, I think, from Irving County. It was Mercer or something like that.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.720] Mercer was the first graduate, I think, from Irving County. It was Mercer or something like that.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.720] And so, they were strong. They were politically strong.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.720] And they had a big store. They had all this good from Hawkinsville down here.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.720] Made a lot of money for that day.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:46.720] And I still think that it would have lasted longer if they had been more cordial to the people than they were.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.720] But now, my daddy was a good man, not because he was my father.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:58.720] He looked at things from, as the scriptures stand for, and come let us reason together, the scripture says, you know.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.720] And he was kin to them, and mother kin to them on Aunt Eunice's side.
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.720] Uncle Walden's wife was my grandmother's sister. She was on my widow's side.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.720] Daddy and Uncle Walden was cousins.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.720] But this side grew tired of it.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.720] A good long ways from over here to go to Irving.
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.720] A good long way from Ashburn to come to Irving, all the way back in there, you know.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.720] So, they put in to move it over here.
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.720] And oh, they had an election.
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.720] So they said, after the election, I'll tell you this now.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:40.720] They said, well, oh man, Walden, Walter Clemmons.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.720] They said, well, Mr. Clemmons, they won, didn't they?
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.720] They said, well, Mr. Clemmons, they won, didn't they?
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.720] Yes, yes, they won.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.720] Rogued us out of it. Stole it, stole it.
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.720] And I remember J.A. Henderson, he was a strong old man over here that day.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.720] He had this beautiful horn over here south of town, that big two-story yellow brick horn.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.720] So the man, J.A. Henderson, he and George Clemmons were close kin, you know, on the widowed side.
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.720] So the man, J.A. Henderson, he was a big if here, and they could find him went broke.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.720] Oh, but he was strong for this.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.720] He said, now Jimmy, Judge Clemmons told him, and Walden had died.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.720] He said, now Jimmy, let's look at it from this standpoint.
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.720] He says, you know, we stole just as many as you all did in that election.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.720] Now you all, you stole just as many as we did.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:40.720] But anyhow, the majority of the vote for our consequence at the courthouse was moved.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:46.720] To O'Sullivan, where it's been ever since. I think that's about 1908, according to the record of the corner down there.
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.720] I think it was 1911.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.720] 1911.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.720] And then you had these ponds, these Coleman Ponds and Ross Lake and so on.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.720] What do you think causes them to run out like that and come back in?
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.720] Well, I believe that there's an underground stream.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.720] Now, they tried Ross Lake several years ago.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:08.720] I did not see it, but there are signs there of some brick and debris and things like that.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.720] So a man, Dan Davis, a very wealthy old man, owned thousands of acres of land.
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.720] But he fought it eventually out of the Ross State.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.720] He bought it.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:24.720] They said, possibly, that he tried to seal it by pouring in concrete, brick and what have you.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.720] And this is history now.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.720] This, I wouldn't know whether it's any reality to it or not.
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.720] But that it did, BOOF, blow it out.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:40.720] Therefore, they say that the pressure, I know by some means or other, it didn't avail anything.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.720] It didn't stop that at all.
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.720] Now Cecil, my oldest son, lives in Sylvania.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.720] He's a little bit of a tractor dealer over there.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.720] He told me why he was here not long ago.
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.720] He said, Daddy, I've got a small bulldozer over there.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.720] He says, how about me bringing it over there?
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.720] I want to try my hand on it by filling up that hole.
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:04.720] Of course, Daddy didn't approve of that because I'm afraid him bulldozers and all would go out of sight.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.720] So, but it's a strange place.
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.720] There is an underground stream.
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.720] I went down here at the mill the other day and I got to looking at the cement.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.720] How much will you charge me for 200 sacks of cement?
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.720] And I forgot whether they quoted a price or not.
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.720] They were busy. I just got to them on mine.
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.720] I said, I'd want you to deliver it.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:30.720] And with the little, those little low buggers that they run them around on, don't you see?
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.720] They couldn't carry over 10 or 12 bags at the time.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:41.720] I said, then from out yonder where the water reaches to, I'd want you to drive from there down with that and pour it down in that well until we pour in about 200 bags.
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.720] Just pour it in dry?
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.720] Pour it in dry.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.720] I would love to see it tried.
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.720] It probably would be just money thrown away.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.720] I don't know.
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:56.720] But others have said that, I lost a brother-in-law I believe a week before last, lived to be almost 85.
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:04.720] He said that he believed you go there with wire and hay and concrete, or cement rather, and this, that, and the other and pour it down in there.
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.720] He would have a tendency to seal that hole.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.720] Now the boys that did it.
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.720] It might form a new hole to get around.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:11.720] Might do it.
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.720] These boys that go down.
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:13.720] A fellow called.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.720] Coleman lives not far from it.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.720] He's a good fisherman.
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.720] He says you can feel a suction.
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:19.720] He went down in the thing.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:20.720] I wouldn't go in it for nothing.
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.720] And I advise other boys to stay out of it.
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:31.720] But the only life that we have in record of that's ever been lost there a few years ago, it was sad.
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.720] Fine boy.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.720] Alton Hawkins was his name.
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.720] Great big much of a man.
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:41.720] And they baled peanut hay in those days with a mule baler and this, that, and the other.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.720] And he worked hard all day.
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:50.720] And this other boy, won't call his name, but he was from across the river and sort of a smart aleck.
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.720] So he goes and gets him up about two or three more.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.720] And this boy, and this boy told him, said, I don't want to go boys.
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:57.720] I'm tired.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.720] It's cold in November.
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.720] And Lee and Lewis at that time, and G.U. Fletcher, they owned the lake before I bought it.
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:08.720] And says, you come on.
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:09.720] We'll catch them.
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.720] We're going to slip in there and sand it tonight.
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:12.720] Which was wrong.
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.720] You know, they shouldn't have done it.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.720] And he went.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.720] And so that started.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:23.720] It always start with the sand over on the west side and come out and land on this side.
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:28.720] Sometimes they start at the north side and go south with the big sand there.
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:33.720] Anyway, he hollered for help directly.
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.720] And John William Wilson, a neighbor of mine at that, got into it too.
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.720] And he run to it.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.720] And this big Hawkins boy.
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.720] He grabbed John by the hand.
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:48.720] And all they could do was just, well, this child was the boy who got him into it.
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.720] And he run and grabbed John William by the hand.
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.720] And he yanked him and yanked him loose from Hawkins.
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.720] And Hawkins went down, down, down.
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.720] He had on big shoes.
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.720] He had big feet.
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.720] Tremendous sized man.
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.720] Well, they couldn't do a thing.
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.720] And they were dark, you know.
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.720] So they come out and said, all we can do is just go and tell what's happened.
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.720] So they come to Lee and Lewis, the owner of it, our part owner.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.720] Said, well, boys, y'all shouldn't have done it.
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.720] But he says, let's go.
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.720] So at that time, he and Juju Fletcher were there on Crystal Lake.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:31.720] And they took the big hooks that they'd been dragging dead people out of Bone Pond with in Crystal Lake.
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.720] And they went over there and made a dragger to him that hung in his clothes.
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:35.720] And they pulled him out.
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.720] And they put him on a truck and brought him, I think, on out.
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.720] That's before that road was cut through there.
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.720] The old three-path road was there then.
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.720] But they brought Alton's body out to him.
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.720] Well, the ambulance was.
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.720] He was dead, drowned.
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.720] What do they suppose happened?
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.720] Cold. The water was cold.
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.720] And I think him tired and them big heavy shoes on.
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.720] And he got scared and so on.
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.720] I think he could swim.
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.720] And he liked to pull John William Wilson.
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:06.720] They said that Watt's child had a job jerking him a loop.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.720] So, uh...
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.720] That's the only record we have.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:16.720] Now, old Billy McDaniel, an old Scotsman, an old settler,
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:21.720] he used to own land there, close to it, and he had slaves.
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:28.720] And he had an idea, for some purpose, I know not what,
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.720] that he could ditch that pond.
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:34.720] And on the northwest corner, if you had known it the other day when you was there,
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.720] I could carry and show you right where the ditch is.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.720] He took his hands and he dug a ditch.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.720] It's like this now.
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.720] It wasn't like that.
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.720] About this deep.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.720] And there's just this plain where they dug it.
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.720] And they dug it in a northwest of the direction.
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:57.720] I had it down all the time in my mind that it flowed out from the northwest corner
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.720] and went directly across there to the river.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.720] But I was wrong.
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.720] After the river was built, it went north.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.720] Well, McDaniel, he knew what he was doing.
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:07.720] And he was...
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.720] Let me get this straight now.
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:13.720] When I was there, the well's pretty much in the center.
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:14.720] Well, really...
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:21.720] Up one side, there's a kind of a narrow area where it looks like during wet weather,
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.720] a stream empties into the pond.
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:27.720] There's a bunch of big old cypresses along that stream bed there.
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.720] Which end? Is that the south end there?
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.720] This is the north end, back there.
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.720] Your south end down this way, yeah.
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.720] Well, that's stream drainage.
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.720] Is that on the south end?
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.720] It comes in both ways.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.720] The water goes...
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:47.720] Well, the place where the road comes to, where you walk into it from, is that the east side?
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.720] That's the east side. That's correct.
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:50.720] And across there is west.
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:51.720] Beyond is north.
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.720] And here is south.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:58.720] Now, the bay comes across our original homeland right below there.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.720] It heads about, I'd say, two miles south of there.
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.720] It's the only stream that I know of in this county that runs north.
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.720] That's true.
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.720] That's true.
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:07.720] I don't think the old bay is over.
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.720] It might be a little over two miles.
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:10.720] It's a big old swamp.
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:11.720] All kinds of wood in there.
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.720] I've sold right smart old timber out of it.
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.720] Now, others has too all along.
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.720] What do you call it, the bay?
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.720] They call it the bay.
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:23.720] And it flows into it when high water comes.
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.720] It flows in from the south.
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:33.720] Runs north, directly and empties from where you saw those thick cypresses on that side right there.
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.720] Go ahead, Oliver.
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.720] I'll show you the picture.
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:58.720] But in that lake, some of this pretty Indian relic, flints, that you're going to see has been found at that place.
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.720] Right in the lake?
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.720] In the lake.
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:02.720] Down in that mud lake.
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:03.720] I don't mean a big amount of them.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:10.720] But even last year, it's pretty a flint.
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:17.720] As you would want to see, I expect it was at least that long.
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.720] That fully a flint.
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.720] And of all things, let me tell you this.
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:24.720] I hated it so bad.
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:31.720] R.J.A. naturally, my son, he had his members from his church down there, you know, to help him.
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:32.720] Which he wanted to show me.
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.720] Which he wanted to show me that Curtis Henneman probably did.
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:42.720] And so this lady found this tremendous flint.
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.720] Which R.J.A. couldn't afford to ask her for it, and she has it.
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.720] But he's got a collection I'd left you to see.
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.720] He's really got lots of them.
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.720] Has he been collecting them for a good part of his life?
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.720] Oh yeah, he's been collecting them for a good part of his life, yes.
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.720] That's right.
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.720] Um.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.720] I've got a few.
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:14:59.720] I've got a few.
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.720] I've got a few.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.720] So I think, I believe, that about covers...
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:11.720] Except a little more history I'm going to give you now.
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:18.720] John Lyons settled in the lot of 107.
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.720] He was the first settler.
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:24.720] And he cleared that land just on the west side from here.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.720] You see, yonder way back there, across there.
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:28.720] And he got the land.
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.720] He had it all.
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:34.880] He settled in there and made a living on that. Of course there was plenty of game in those days,
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:42.080] don't you see? Plenty of fish. And just across the river, go back to Smoke County folks now,
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:49.520] Uncle Elbert Park, met Aunt Rachel Clements. She and my daddy was cousins, and Uncle Elbert,
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:55.240] my mother, was growing up on the park side, and daddy and Aunt Rachel on the Clements side. So,
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:16:09.280] Jack was his man of color. So Aunt Rachel, her first children, was twins, Faithy and Nancy was
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:16.560] their names. So the last part of the Civil War, they called on them for the Elbert to go. And I
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:21.820] want to tell you this because it's so sweet, I hope you'll record this, but it's true. He says,
[00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:25.120] Jack, I'm going to have to go to this war.
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:34.060] And I've got nobody to leave here with Rachel. Nancy and Faithy was the names of the girls,
[00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:40.900] twins. And I want you to stay right here with them and take care of them until I come back.
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:51.320] And I'd give, as poor a man as I am, I don't know, I'd be able to give $500 anyhow if I could know
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:55.220] where Jack's buried, whether he died or what happened. But I'd give $500. And I'd give $500.
[00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:55.680] And I'd give $500. And I'd give $500. And I'd give $500. And I'd give $500. And I'd give $500. And I'd give $500.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:56.420] And I'd give $500. And I'd give $500. And I'd give $500. And I'd give $500. But Uncle Elbert went,
[00:16:56.420 --> 00:17:05.320] and the Lord blessed him to come back. But he stayed right there, Jack did. He took care of
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:18.260] Aunt Rachel and those little girls. And naturally, he fell in love with Hen, a woman of color,
[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:24.520] just across the river. On this same body of land now that you saw on the west side,
[00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:32.420] in the meantime, the lions had stayed his day out, and it went into the hands of old Billy McDaniel.
[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:45.580] And he had a woman of color. They called her Hen. So Jack comes across a courting. Courts and
[00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:54.820] marries Hen. Well, the only way he had to come across was in a bateau boat, a small boat,
[00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:55.200] in the river. And he had to come across a boat. And he had to come across a boat. And he had to
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:18:00.960] come across a boat. And he had to come across a boat. And he had to come across a boat. And the river was full. And he'd come over and spend the night with Hen.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:08.160] It all seems, I know, to make the colored folks mad, because they never should have had no slaves. They didn't believe in it and all.
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:16.740] But we did. And then he'd go back to Aunt Rachel and them children, and stay with them. Therefore, leading from the farm,
[00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:24.800] across on that hill on the west side, back down into the river, is known as Jack's Path. There's two lakes down there. Just, you know, two lakes.
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:33.560] Just across from the Coleman Farm, over that rise, there's two lakes. And they called them Jack's Path lakes. So when it was full, he'd come in his bateau across.
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:43.760] When it was dry, he'd walk across there. And that's where it derived its name from. Jack's Path lakes, right through there.
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:50.860] Speaking of those bateaus, you ever see one of those boats that was hewed out of the Cypress log?
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:54.640] No, I've seen the pictures of them, but I don't think that I ever saw one.
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:59.640] I may have, but my memory doesn't record it right now.
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.640] What'd they make boats out of when you were a boy?
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:07.640] Well, they'd lumber. Just rough lumber. There was Cypress. Cypress makes them out of good boat.
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:12.640] And you get it very thick, it's heavy, you know, but it will stay down and sort of hold some water.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:21.640] Yes, it will. I was helping a fella push a Cypress boat through the swamp down there in the Alafa River a couple of weeks ago.
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:22.640] Yeah.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.640] Never again.
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.640] No, man, you had a job, didn't you?
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:29.640] Yeah, I was about a 12-footer.
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:35.640] I went around this pond to fishing, Coleman Pond, one time myself, to show you that it does have those holes in it now.
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:40.640] And I was over on the west side, beyond where the well and the bluff side is over yonder.
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:45.640] And all at once, I just zhoop, went down just about like this.
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.640] I just caught on the sides, you know, just pulled myself right out.
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:53.640] But to me, it seemed just like that the hole was not much bigger than my body.
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.640] I was just the latter of a boy.
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:59.640] And I zhoop, down on it, and I caught and just pulled myself right back up.
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.640] So there's holes around it like that.
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:05.640] There's some underground, something or another about it, I don't know.
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:06.640] Yeah.
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.640] But when it fills up, it fills up from the bottom, right?
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:09.640] Oh, yeah.
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:10.640] It's not just rainwater that collects.
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.640] Well, it comes in it. The bay empties into it.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:22.640] Also, where this creek overflows coming in from the northeast, and it also, under those big cover, under that highway, hit fours in there too, don't you think?
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:23.640] Right.
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:28.640] And I think the flat water and all that covers over at least 50 to 60 acres.
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:32.640] The D zone, it calls for 35 acres more or less to the high water mark.
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:40.640] And so, just to be so tedious sometimes to throw out so many beer cans there, I don't like that at all.
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.640] Try to make all of them welcome to go fishing when they want to, but…
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.640] Well, I was surprised. There's hardly any trash there at all now.
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:50.640] Just, you know, one or two little rusted cans that I saw.
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:51.640] Well, I agree.
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:52.640] And awesome scale.
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:59.640] I talked a little while back in the store, and I told the people that I've tried to make all of them welcome, and please not to throw out the beer cans.
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:06.640] We may sell it. I told to Jay. I gave, I made a deed to him and Marjorie, my daughter, and my son, and said,
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.640] Hey, that piece of land for you, go and say sell it if you want to.
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.640] And so, the other day, someone was talking about it, and I said, Yeah, we'll sell it.
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:16.640] You want to give $500 an acre for us? Go on, take it.
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:21.640] That field back out this way, this coastal Bermuda there, you know, there's 100 acres in this square.
[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:27.640] And then the pond, in other words, this 100 acres is on the lot 108, comes right up the highway, you see.
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:40.640] And then the pond back here is supposed to be 35 acres more or less to the high water where my oldest brother, John R. Clements, he said that there's at least 50 to 60 acres of it when it covered the big flat water.
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:46.640] How about this fellow that wanted to make the ditch? Did he want to drain the pond, or did he want to keep it full?
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:49.640] Whether he was trying to connect it with the river.
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:50.640] That's one thing I didn't know.
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.640] That's one thing I didn't finish a while ago.
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:22:01.640] But after the road was built, then I discovered that this had to go out to Willis Creek and into the Lappahoe River to connect with the river.
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:16.640] I thought all the time, and I drove up there not far from it, that it had just swung abruptly to the left and went straight across, but it didn't because there was a high hill on the Lyons Place and Jack's Path, as I tell you about over there.
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.640] So, there's a lot of water.
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:22.640] There's another old tale I want to tell you about too.
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.640] This is another joke, I hope, and one of the best stuff that I've quoted.
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:30.640] I ought not have told you that about Mother Fellows.
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:31.640] No, not at all.
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:35.640] The lady said that she called her husband.
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:42.640] Anyway, she had a right, I know the meaning of it, probably because he did neglect her and go off and should have stayed there and supported her and them children.
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.640] Well, if it's in the court record, it doesn't matter.
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:45.640] But, anyway.
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:46.640] Yeah.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:47.640] Uh.
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.640] I will forget.
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:53.640] That just shows my age on these things.
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:54.640] Yeah.
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:59.640] At the north end, where the man dug the ditch.
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:02.640] Let's get right back to that now.
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:08.640] They, uh, put a trap in there.
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:14.640] And they caught a jack and they weighed 140-something pounds.
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:15.640] Uh.
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:16.640] Uh.
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:17.640] Correct.
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:23.640] A jack that weighed 140-something pounds?
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:26.640] Either 140-something or 150-something pounds.
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.640] That's correct.
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:28.640] Jack Holgrin.
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:36.640] I knew there was something in there.
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:39.640] They said that was a thing somebody put in the fish trap.
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.640] I didn't know that name was jack.
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.640] They told that and laughed about it.
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.640] Well, tell me something.
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:49.640] Uh, different people have told me a lot of legends about Crystal Lake.
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:53.640] It seems to be one of the most legend-full places around here.
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:58.640] They, one of them told me that there's a, that that mill is down at the bottom of the
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.640] lake and on a clear day you can see it down there.
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:05.640] It's over on this south side, back this way.
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.640] And because, now there's portions.
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:09.640] I haven't been there in years.
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:13.640] But I walked all around there where the old mill was and there were pieces of the old
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:14.640] iron.
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:21.640] I picked up two or three and put in the car and carried back over to the house and where
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:24.640] I put them I don't know.
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.640] But, uh, bones over the mill.
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:30.640] Have you heard any other legends that are connected with that place like that?
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:31.640] Probably have.
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:33.640] I don't remember that now.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:38.640] Another one told me that there's been several people drowned in the lake and they never
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:39.640] found the bodies.
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.640] No, I don't know.
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.640] I, every one I think has been recovered.
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:49.640] Now the only one that I have any record of that never anything found of him was the
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:50.640] nigger man.
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:51.640] Right.
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:52.640] That I told you about.
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:53.640] They believe that bones sunk him.
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:58.640] Probably carried him out in a boat if he did and sunk him in the deepest part of the lake.
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.640] I hope, I hope that the nigger got away.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.640] That's what I hope.
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:02.640] Hope he didn't.
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:07.640] But the boy, Taylor, of course I don't think he saw his daddy do it.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:08.640] I don't think so.
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.640] Well they said he opened it up honestly and just told them.
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:18.640] But he knew that he did kill Walker, don't you see?
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:24.640] Well, this, I'm real interested in those legends even if they aren't true, you know.
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:32.640] Well, it's true that people had a struggle to exist in those days.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:36.640] They knew what it was to squeeze a dime or a nickel or a quarter.
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:39.640] The first lot of land my daddy bought, the home was built in 1895.
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:40.640] It wasn't the first lot of land.
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:41.640] The first one was a big log house.
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:46.640] And then I think my dad gave that to my oldest brother and built the frame house that stands
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:47.640] there today.
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:48.640] It was built in 1895.
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:51.640] Do you recall that log house, what it looked like?
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:52.640] No.
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.640] And as the old-timers used to say, my mind's eye, I can see it.
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:55.640] I think they first built what we used to call the big house.
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:56.640] And then the kitchen.
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:57.640] The dwelling sat this way, chimney to the chin.
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:58.640] They built that.
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:25:59.640] And then the first house built in 1895.
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:00.640] And that was a very famous house.
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.640] And I think the first house built in 1895, the first was the second house.
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:02.640] And the first one was the third house.
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:03.640] And that was the first house.
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:04.640] And I think that was the third house.
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:05.640] I think the first house was the third house.
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:09.020] The dwelling sat this way, chimney to chimney.
[00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:13.040] They built that hall in the middle.
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.260] Big room here, big room here.
[00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:17.320] Was that hall open at both ends or?
[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:19.600] Was, it's closed now.
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:20.440] Oh, the-
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:23.700] Side room over on this side, side room over on this side,
[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:25.040] side room over there.
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.460] Then there was a short walkway,
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:30.800] not much longer than this table,
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:34.080] from the big house to the kitchen.
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:35.840] So the kitchen sets up there today.
[00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:39.260] I reworked it.
[00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:42.860] Wife and I, we stay there soon.
[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:44.580] Not like we ought to, but our home,
[00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:46.320] we bought our home here in Old Sutter.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.160] Got it?
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:48.240] Where you came to the other day?
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.080] Yeah.
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.220] I first, when I bought Old Sutter,
[00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:53.260] I bought in the southwest corner down here in town.
[00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:55.360] Sold it then and bought this little place.
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.420] But the two buildings are right there today
[00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:01.580] that Daddy built.
[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:03.420] Is the walkway still between them?
[00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:04.060] No.
[00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:04.900] You moved it around.
[00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:05.720] You moved the kitchen.
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:06.560] Oh, you moved the kitchen.
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:08.080] It's set south now of the house.
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.240] It's not connected with the other,
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.740] it's a whole distance,
[00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:13.500] far from here to the wall over yonder.
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:14.780] Why did they build that way,
[00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:16.780] the kitchen separate from the main house?
[00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:20.380] Well, that was a custom of long ago,
[00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:22.520] they built what was known as the big house,
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:24.620] the dwelling notes, you see.
[00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:26.800] And then, all,
[00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:30.660] fully the distance from here to the north side
[00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:31.880] of the office over yonder,
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:33.040] or,
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:34.760] it's much,
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.700] it's an area that's half the size of the house
[00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:39.020] of being the main house.
[00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:39.460] It's narrow,
[00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:40.240] it's ten예
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.000] you Wegener Premium.
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.720] It's one of the things they went and build.
[00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:45.280] How many walls are there in there?
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:49.780] Out of twenty-four but there's no more in there.
[00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:50.560] They're up in the reading,
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:52.360] not many at that stage with no windows down there.
[00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:54.780] There's a stairs,
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:57.340] if it ran and what have you.
[00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:59.400] Some would have a walkway covered,
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:00.780] but not many.
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.340] I know I went to them with my sisters up there,
[00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:08.740] Here's the dining table, sitting this way. This was it, north and south, this was east and west.
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:18.020] I said, how are you all today? Very well. How are you? Very well, thank you ma'am.
[00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:26.500] I said, Miss Williamson? I said, uh, Rural Electric Association would like to come to here,
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:34.500] if you all would be interested, they've got me employed to secure members, get right-of-ways and so on.
[00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:39.620] They all sat quietly at the table. Now listen, I think most all of them had on their bonnets,
[00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:48.180] they'd eat with their bonnets on. They listened. And I said, uh, we'd be glad to put it through here if she'd agree with me.
[00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:54.100] I said, the membership fee is only five dollars, and you don't have to pay that now, you can pay it later on.
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:06.500] My mum, my mum, my mum, she said to one of them, the other, she got up, quietly went down the steps, she come back.
[00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:14.500] I said, Miss Williamson, you don't have to, we pay now. We pay now. Yes ma'am, thank you, thank you.
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:20.500] I wrote the receipts and all. I says, have you folks, I'm getting you back now into some old timey things.
[00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:24.500] I says, do you folks have any news?
[00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:26.500] No.
[00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:28.500] No.
[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.500] One of them looked up to me.
[00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:32.500] Have you any?
[00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:34.500] No ma'am.
[00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:40.500] That was the greeting in those days, buddy. That's a fact, cause I was a lot younger than them.
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:48.500] And you know they lived right on that old place. They walked out of that house, through that north side room, or else it was a porch.
[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:54.500] No, there's a porch over here. Down the steps, walking on the ground on that side of their kitchen.
[00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.500] How many of them lived there?
[00:29:56.500 --> 00:30:01.500] I think every one of them died, right there at that old place. Good old saintly Christian people.
[00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:03.500] How many were there?
[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.500] About four or five of them.
[00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:06.500] All sisters and all unmarried?
[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:12.500] One of them married, just one. And her husband died and then she went back to live with them the rest of her life.
[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:16.500] She didn't have any children. She was getting along. He had lost his first wife.
[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:18.500] But that kitchen was thirty or forty feet from the house?
[00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:24.500] Yes, fully. An old man, Dave Clements, an old cousin of my daddy's, his old house sat off this way.
[00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:31.500] The old kitchen, it was back out here. You walked farther from their house to the kitchen than you did from the Williamson sisters up there.
[00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:34.500] Why do you suppose they separated the kitchens like that?
[00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:38.500] I wonder, was it because of fire? I don't really know.
[00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:45.500] I don't either. Of course, used to be, pre-war times, slaves would cook the food, I guess.
[00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:46.500] Yeah.
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:48.500] They'd kind of keep the slaves and the kitchen out there.
[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:49.500] Separate, that's true.
[00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:52.500] Keep the cooking odors out and such. I'm not sure.
[00:30:52.500 --> 00:31:01.500] But then later on, the kitchen, they kept that kitchen detached from the main house, but they had that little walkway there.
[00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:05.500] Now, when you were growing up, did you grow up in a house like that with the kitchen separate?
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:10.500] Yes, yes. Now, I remember, I think that's what makes me feel so afraid of bad weather at times.
[00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:13.500] I'm talking about thunder and lightning and wind, of course.
[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:17.500] But mother, I was the baby, the other child in the family.
[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:21.500] And we had started.
[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.500] We had two little boys that happened to be world領.
[00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:25.940] Well, those two guys have been built siamo voglia.
