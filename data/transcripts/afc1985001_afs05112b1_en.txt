[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.240] There lived a rich old merchant in London, he did well, he had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell, oh, the truth to you I'll tell.
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:24.100] She had sweethearts a-plenty, two-quarter day and night, and none but Jackie Fraser could gain her heart's delight, oh, could gain her heart's delight.
[00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:36.140] Her father flew in a passion and straightway he did go, and bargained with the captain to throw Jack overboard, oh, to throw Jack overboard.
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:48.000] Jackie, he's a-sailing upon the deep blue sea, and sooner he'll be anchored to the walls of Germany, oh, to the walls of Germany.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.000] Polly goes into a tailor shop, she dressed in men's soiree.
[00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.800] Then bargains with the captain to carry her away, oh, to carry her away.
[00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:12.860] Your waist is mighty slender, your fingers wide and small, your cheek's too red and rosy to face those cannonballs, oh, to face those cannonballs.
[00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:24.080] I know my waist, it's slender, my fingers both wide and small, but it'll never make me tremble to see ten thousand fall, oh, to see ten thousand fall.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.500] Polly, she's a-sailing, she's sailing far and wide, she's sailing for her darling, her darling butterfly.
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.960] poster ohnedemano
[00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.000] Oh, oh, her darling butterfly.
[00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.960] Polly looking at her distintos skin, so young and healthy,
[00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.200] Polly, she's safe landed upon the battle Bridgestone shore,
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.140] Polly recording this march around the food fleet.
[00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.200] Polly looking at her xenomorphic responsibilities,
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.100] circling the ground with soaring charm
[00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.300] Polly looking at her xenomorphic responsibilities, because she's too young, she's too pretty.
[00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.060] They mongered it and wounded her darling boy she found.
[00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.360] Oh, her darling boy she found.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.760] She picked him up in her arms and carried him down to town
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.540] and called for a physician to cure his bleeding wounds.
[00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.760] Oh, to cure his bleeding wounds.
[00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.200] Now Jack and Polly's married and they both do agree.
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.080] Now Jack and Polly's married and why not you and me?
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.280] Oh, and why not you and me?
