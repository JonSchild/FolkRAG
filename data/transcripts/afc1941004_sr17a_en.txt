[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.120] I just got a telegram from the Library of Congress in Washington, and they want the
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:35.760] idea of a few average men and women recorded on their reactions when they heard of the Japanese aggression.
[00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:44.800] Now, these records will be used in a historical record being accumulated in the Library of Congress,
[00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.000] and possibly for radio broadcasts.
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.000] Now, will you tell me...
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.920] What you thought when you heard of what the Japanese government had done to the American government?
[00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:06.160] My first thought was, what a great pity that the world at large, that another nation,
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:15.820] should be added to those aggressors who strove to limit our freedom.
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.080] I find myself...
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:27.560] at the age of 80, an old woman, hanging onto the tail of the world, trying to keep up.
[00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:37.640] I do not want the driver's seat, but of the eternal verities, there are certain things that I wish to express.
[00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:49.400] One thing that I am very sure of is that hatred is death, but love is life.
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:02:00.500] I want to contribute to the civilization of the world, but I remember that the measure,
[00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.960] the broadness of our sympathies is the measure of our civilization.
[00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:19.000] And when I look at the Holocaust that is going on in the world today, I'm almost ready to let go of the tail feathers of the world.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.500] I want to be more of a human being, and I want to be more of a human being, and I want to be more of an American.
[00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.120] Where is your home, Mrs. Jameson?
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.960] It's in Redondo Beach, California.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.180] And how long have you lived there?
[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.180] About 20 years.
[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.540] And what are you doing out in Texas?
[00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.960] I'm visiting my children, whom I've often visited before.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.040] I see.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.040] I see.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.160] I see.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.220] I see.
[00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.280] I see.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.340] I see.
[00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.440] I see.
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.460] I see.
[00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.520] I see.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.540] I see.
[00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.580] I see.
[00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.680] I see.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.720] I see.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.780] I see.
[00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.840] I see.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.860] I see.
[00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.920] I see.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.940] I see.
[00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.980] I see.
[00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:50.020] I see.
[00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.120] I see.
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.520] I see.
[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.980] I see.
[00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:51.900] I see.
[00:02:51.900 --> 00:03:00.020] I recognize that for the While you're سýingР

[00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.740] éger
[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.980] あie
[00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.340] from what my impression would be if I had been in touch with the military
[00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:40.100] division of the Japanese in their native. My impression is modified by what I read
[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:47.920] and hear of those. My impression of the Japanese as I have seen is that they are law-abiding
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.920] and desirable citizens, with exceptions.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:01.920] Mr. Tillwell, have you anything to add to what your mother has said?
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:09.020] Well, of course, my point of view is very different. But my first reaction was that
[00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:17.020] either the Japanese were a very, very conceited race or that they were very, very desperate.
[00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.820] I think that's a very good point.
[00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.900] Thank you.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:25.280] Somehow, I just can't believe that a little island like Japan can attack the United States
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.700] and hope to be successful in the long run.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:43.100] This is John Lomax speaking. The last lady on the microphone was Mrs. Jerry Stillwell,
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.540] the daughter of Mrs. Lena Jameson.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:59.360] Who spoke first on this record. This record was made in Dallas, Texas, December the 9th,
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.200] 1941, for the Library of Congress in Washington.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.740] Thank you.
