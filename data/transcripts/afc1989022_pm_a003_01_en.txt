[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.640] All right, Paula.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.420] So let's just start off by saying it's June 25th,
[00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.160] and I'm with Josephine and Tony Martellaro
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.840] and Josephine's mother, Mrs. Crow Shaw.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.440] We're out in Blend.
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.980] Josephine had a St. Joseph's Day table this year,
[00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.000] the first time ever that she...
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.900] That I've had one.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.300] Yeah.
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.640] And we're looking through her album of the St. Joseph's Day table.
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.640] And so this is a newspaper article?
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.920] This was the article where it was telling about the table
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.060] and that it was, you know, the open house,
[00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.940] and everybody was welcome.
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.820] And this was specifically on your table?
[00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.580] Yes.
[00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.320] Okay.
[00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.740] And how did the media find out about it?
[00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.960] We called them and told them we'd like it.
[00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.060] We had a write-up or something in the paper
[00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.320] so that people would know they were welcome to come out here.
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.860] And then we had an invitation we put at the school district.
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.420] That's where you were.
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.940] Mm-hmm.
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.760] So that to invite everybody there.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.440] Then on the next page is the thanks that I had.
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.300] And there was 13 of them?
[00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.700] Right.
[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.060] And you have to have an odd number.
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.560] Uh-huh.
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.300] But it doesn't have to be 13?
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.620] No.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.460] I think they said,
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.620] someone told me that you can have seven,
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.040] from seven up.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.540] Mm-hmm.
[00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.220] But you always had to have an odd number.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.840] And did they say why?
[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.420] I really don't know why.
[00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.440] They didn't ever say.
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.240] I would say my guess is that
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.480] because Judith was probably kind of banned
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.760] from the...
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.760] Mm-hmm.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.760] ...from the apostles.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.760] You know, there were 12 apostles.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.760] Um, that maybe just then that left 11.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.760] Mm-hmm.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.760] Maybe that's it.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.760] I don't know.
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.760] But I never did find out why.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.760] And we asked Betsy Engle and Rose Dazzle, and they, nobody could give me an answer.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.760] They just said it had to be an odd number.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.760] Huh.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.760] And that is the schematic I did on the computer of our table.
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.760] And it's all the different...
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.760] Mm-hmm.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.760] Right.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.760] And then this is the...
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.760] And then this is the...
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.760] And then this is the...
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.760] And then this is the...
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.760] And then this is the...
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.760] And then this is the...
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.760] And then this is the...
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.760] And then this is the legend of it.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.760] Mm-hmm.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.760] And so there's about 60 items listed here, and there are that many?
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:42.760] There was that many plus because these had, like number 60 had tea rings, coffee cakes,
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.760] raisin bread, and there was many different kinds of the bread.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.760] And then there were a lot of, in all these spaces, there was no space on the table.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:53.760] Mm-hmm.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.760] We had like nuts, popcorn balls, cheese.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.760] Mm-hmm.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.760] Chocolate candy.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.760] Mm-hmm.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.760] Vegetables, just all kinds of things.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.760] There was tons of food, and a lot of fruit.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.760] And, but this list here, it's mostly sweets and desserts.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.760] It's, right.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.760] And then your...
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.760] But this doesn't include the meal even.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.760] No, that had, was not the meal.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.760] The only part that we served at the meal was like the omelets.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.760] Mm-hmm.
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.760] Okay.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.760] And then the...
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.760] And then the...
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.760] And then the...
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.760] And then the...
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.760] And then the...
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.760] And then the...
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.760] And then the...
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.760] And then the...
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.760] And then the...
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.760] And then the...
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.760] And then the...
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.760] And then the...
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.760] And then the...
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.760] And then the...
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:34.760] And the fish, and see it goes on display 24 hours before you serve it.
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.760] Uh-huh.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.760] And everything has to be taken off, not everything, but anything like the fish and the omelets
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.760] and any vegetables with that.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:53.760] We had to take off at night, you know, after the last person comes, put it in the refrigerator
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.760] and take it back out in the morning.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.760] Right.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.760] All right.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:04.360] it back down yeah and that was the problem it's not this time of year really you couldn't have
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:10.360] it now and that was a problem because you had to make sure you had you know had plenty of room in
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:16.760] refrigerators thank goodness that well i have two refrigerators then we used the neighbors
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:23.000] we used our sons my sister-in-laws and my daughters and when we were making all these
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.480] cookies and the breads and that because you can't really make it just a day before you'd never get
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:37.320] that right so we started making these items and um we were using freezers well the neighbor had a
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:44.360] whole freezer that was completely empty we almost filled it up i had two of mine almost filled
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:52.600] anthony had his filled in fact he had two freezers there and one we used to fill with
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:59.960] uh the burbakis the bread patties that they had made and uh the spaghetti
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.960] tony's mother always made that
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.120] it was just bread bread and onions
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.840] sometimes mom would grind
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.720] and make it into a patty now my kids like those better than they do meatballs
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:37.960] and um let's see see these were things we got ready ahead of time and that's why we had to put
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:44.600] it all in these freezers but i'll tell you you need a giant cooler when you're doing that
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:51.720] and like you said if you had it this time of year forget it the um like
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.560] a lot of things we didn't know about like the wheat
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.560] scaplo gardens uh we talked to them and they said they would grow it for us and they did
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:11.000] they had the wheat growing and they gave us also four um lilies and one of the other floral shops
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.520] uh lent us their palms the palm trees are the scalpels italian yes
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.160] is that an italian we saw the sign when it came in
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.120] yeah it sure is
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.080] yes it's a scaplo
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.580] yes it's a scaplo
[00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.640] yes it's a scaplo
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.700] yes it's a scaplo
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:29.320] and uh like i told you we didn't know that anybody would do anything for you that we said we had to do
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:36.200] everything ourselves and so i believe um either joseph and gagliano or beth ingle because my
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.760] daughter debbie contacted beth ingle first to find out all the different things and you know
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:47.880] if they'd remember things they'd tell us and uh she suggested for her to contact mrs scaplo
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.640] and debbie called her and we just you know asked her if she would grow
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:56.600] this we thought we would have to pay for it which you know there was no problem when we went to pick
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:05.000] it up and we told her she was rather insulted you know but i mean i had never had anything
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.160] like this and i just didn't figure anybody just gave things away well so how long in advance did
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:16.200] you have to tell them for them i was trying to think about how long it took her that because
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:21.560] it had to be the first part of february or the end of january when she started growing that
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:30.680] weaned i'm sure and the lilies you know they i don't know where they get them because they could
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:37.240] they tried everything both fabian floral and scapulas to coax them to open up you know so
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:43.000] they'd open up on the day of saint joseph but you couldn't coax those lilies to open up
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:51.240] and i think they opened up two days later they uh tried warm water and this marlene
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:58.120] um i don't know her last name it's fabian floral she called me because see dominic
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:05.960] jidon was the man that ordered all these from um the flowers and that from fabian's and he does this
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:11.720] every year well he did it he passed away like i told you two weeks ago he always ordered the
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:17.240] flowers and that for all the people you know somebody that had a saint joseph's day table
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.560] and then he'd come out and see if he could get some flowers and he would come out and see if he
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:27.320] was anything he could do for you he's just a real wonderful person i wanted to ask you you were
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:33.160] telling us the other day that you didn't tell tony about the saint joseph's table right away
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:38.600] why did you not do that because i thought well maybe he'll get upset and won't be here
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:49.560] and i thought you know i wasn't sure yeah because he had a hard time after he got so sick really
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.480] coping with a lot
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:59.600] of things you know and I thought oh lamb how do I tell him yeah until the table
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:04.460] was given for to thank Joseph St. Joseph for helping Tony over his illness
[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:14.060] so when you do this do you you yourself will pray to St. Joseph and say I'm praying that my husband gets better and if that happens I will
[00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:20.360] and I have a little prayer and it's one that a friend of mine had given to me to
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:36.020] say and it's oh god it's St. Joseph helper of the hopeless oh boy and I and you say it nine times a day
[00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:44.080] yeah and I have found if I and I say this and if I have a problem it seems to really help I wish
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:49.880] now I've got it'll come to me because and it's a very short little prayer and you just say it nine
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:50.340] times a day
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:10:03.860] we can say it as many times but you're supposed to say it a minimum of nine times and that you know it sounds silly but I mean I wash dishes or doing clothes or anything and I just say this prayer
[00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.860] it helps you through the day
[00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.860] it sure does believe me
[00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:15.860] so what was your reaction when you found out that she was well you're telling the story or you were out of town even and around and people would say
[00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:19.880] yeah I was in a sale and they asked me about it and I'd go no we're not having no
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.160] St. Joseph's table
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.220] and it must be the información down here on the corner of nggak
[00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.560] there's another martellaro down here a mile down the road
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.460] mmhmm
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:30.400] the way to have a Ц down the road his not
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:40.020] mmm well I don't know walk off like ya know what so then my buddy come down and he says well here's a pictures of the table
[00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:50.200] that I'm supposed to make what the hell you talking about this is he said Josephine told me to and he said I guess you Ara
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:50.220] 美
[00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:55.500] supposed to know you he said don't you tell her that i know that i told you don't you say a word
[00:10:55.500 --> 00:11:01.980] about me and so did you after you figured well we better tell him we didn't well i don't know what
[00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:08.220] day that was well it had to be about a week about a week before because it was valentine's day when
[00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:12.220] we told him and my kids kept telling me mother aren't you going to tell that night at the right
[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:19.980] time at the right time so you chose valentine's day right i figured that's a good time sweet r day
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:26.060] now i may the sacred heart of jesus be adored honored loved and glorified throughout the world
[00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:32.300] now and forever sacred heart of jesus pray for us saint jude helper of the hopeless pray for us
[00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:36.860] saint anthony pray for us and saint joseph pray for us
[00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:44.860] and that's it's a very simple prayer but i said that when i have a real stressful day
[00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:49.740] then it really helps and that's the prayer you would say when you make your intentions
[00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:49.820] you say that's the prayer you would say when you make your intentions
[00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:55.900] thank you well it was just a prayer that i said because this friend of mine says that it
[00:11:56.460 --> 00:12:02.700] was when she always prayed you know when she had a problem and that's what i was doing and
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:12.300] as i say tony did not even attend his cousin's um saint joseph's day table
[00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:19.740] the day of the celebration he did go view it that was a year ago because he was so bad you know he'd
[00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:24.540] just couldn't even get out of bed was this arthritis that you just said severe arthritis
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:32.540] yeah rheumatoid arthritis uh-huh and you you feeling pretty good disease yeah pretty good yeah
[00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:39.580] because you said he was couldn't get out of bed he couldn't i mean he was just
[00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:49.260] it was rough and then he'd just go from the bed to the front room to sit on the couch and
[00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:55.660] just kind of uh don't worry and then after he was out he'd go back to work and um i think a lot of it
[00:12:55.660 --> 00:13:01.820] was you know it was the arthritis a lot of trauma the death of both his parents and he just you know
[00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:07.980] he retired you know there's a lot of things going on in your life all at one time and i think it
[00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:14.460] was a lot of trauma and the illness and it just because i do know they said that if you're um
[00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:19.580] stressed out in any way you know problems like that it doesn't help the disease it just makes it worse
[00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:27.060] And then Brittany too. She was like I told you she had that eczema and she had allergies
[00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:34.460] and then she had a um the tibia bone in her foot was tilted and the doctor had told her
[00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:42.040] that um it need to be corrected or she could be crippled for life you know. So uh we we
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:49.040] had three intentions. Two of them were answered. Uh huh. And the third one maybe some day.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:59.540] But um. Brittany and Tony. Right. And uh Brittany like I say the uh finally got her to the proper
[00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:06.280] doctor that really helped. But when you're on these like peak and HMO you know. Oh yeah
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:11.860] it's really limiting. They won't let you go if you know half of them and uh it's
[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:12.020] finally got her to the proper doctor. And uh Brittany's like I said she had that eczema.
[00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.020] She was like I said I need to go to the proper doctor. And uh Tony was like I said I need
[00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.020] to go to the proper doctor. And uh Brittany was like I said I need to go to the proper
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.020] doctor. And uh Tony was like I said I need to go to the proper doctor. And uh Brittany
[00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.680] got to the right doctor. And it was just unbelievable because I know I have pictures where that
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:24.940] little girl just is a massive bruises. And they just bleed. And I mean you know you there's
[00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:30.780] nothing we could do. You couldn't put any kind of lotion. You could put Vaseline and
[00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:36.380] that was about it. And the doctor that my daughter had kept saying well she'll outgrow
[00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:41.840] it. Well you know when you're less than two years old like you're a year old. You can't
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:46.360] fall out. She hadö I mean so precisely. But you know you watch football. So roam A bro
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.340] on the knees over the chopper outside between us. There's some roogan 보시면. And uh
[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:53.300] alo bertenenベrian bowen can read them. And have they got long synthetic best yet.
[00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:59.600] We don't really have the exact date we got here. And it took at least about four years
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:06.900] ago. So it was about eight until she and I saw her then we had an activity period that
[00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:11.660] came between them. FRANKIE V cadre and Jackie Konikowski and his multimillionbeing nurses.

[00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:57.180] pushed me away
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:03.100] before somebody was waiting well because see we'd have to stay all night with my mom you know
[00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:03.580] uh-huh
[00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:07.420] and every night i'd take all my baking up there and i'd bake
[00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:14.700] and then i'd clean everything up and i'd leave samples for her the woman that would come in there
[00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:22.860] so you'd use as many kitchens as you oh you bet and uh my daughter debbie is gonna get this oh okay
[00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:31.660] no problem and jenny did a lot of baking up here at jenny's house jenny redox yeah and um
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:38.660] like me last night when Sandy called she said I said I know I had it in a book somewhere
[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.660] so do you think I could even find it?
[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:41.660] Yeah. Remember her name?
[00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:42.660] Yeah.
[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:46.660] Well you were telling me now that you and Debbie and Jenny really did a lot of the research.
[00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:50.660] You went to the library and around to different people.
[00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:55.660] I went to the library and I was trying to think where else and I even called somewhere.
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:18:02.660] That's why I decided to do the book and get it all lined up because you know I would really feel sorry
[00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:09.660] say like if we hadn't put anything down say our kids down the road they wouldn't even know where to begin
[00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:14.660] because your older people like Bessie and all them will be gone.
[00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:19.660] And they as I say they very much were with us when we made the bread.
[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:21.660] How old is Bessie?
[00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.660] Tony what would you say Bessie is?
[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:24.660] 83, 84?
[00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:25.660] 85?
[00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:26.660] 84?
[00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:28.660] Yeah I think Sam should.
[00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:31.660] About your age.
[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:34.660] I think she might be a couple years older than my mom.
[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.660] I think she's 87, 84.
[00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:41.660] Yeah and Rose is older than her, Rose Dazio.
[00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.660] That's her sister.
[00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:49.660] And I'll tell you those women are something else to be around when we were baking that bread because
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:54.660] they said well and they definitely know what they're doing
[00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:55.660] but you know they're not.
[00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:58.660] So they need to make sure that other people learn.
[00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:03.660] And they were real good after a while but at first it was just they're the ones that
[00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:09.660] and boy I'll tell you I don't care how old they were man they could sure work that bread and
[00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:10.660] then everything.
[00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:12.660] And you did that at Zolman's bakery?
[00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:13.660] At Zolman's bakery.
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:15.660] That's owned by an Italian.
[00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:18.660] Yeah Chuck Martinelli.
[00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:21.660] Yeah and this is the recipe and I wrote down.
[00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:22.660] It's for the bread.
[00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:23.660] Right.
[00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:31.660] And I wrote down this is the ladies told me you know on the how to braid it and how to do all the diagrams and that
[00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:38.660] because I thought you know to make the dough is one thing but you know all the designs and that because I have no idea.
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:40.660] Each bread gets a specific design.
[00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:49.660] The ones for the apostles are all done the same and that's where they make the wreath you know.
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:50.660] Like a braided wreath.
[00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:51.660] Like a braided wreath.
[00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:56.660] And you know what they use is a comb and they make the diamond shape.
[00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:59.660] You have to have a big comb and you go down real hard.
[00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:03.660] And then go this way and then you take the knife and cut it.
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:08.660] And on how did they have it on one end you flatten it out.
[00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:09.660] They call it the fingers.
[00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:15.660] See I never realized that but it's the hand I guess clasped together is what it is the two hands.
[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:20.660] Because then they made it more not on the one part they made it just flat.
[00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:26.660] And then the other one that they brought over they cut the fingers out and then they laid it on top.
[00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:30.660] So they cut the dough and like layered a bit over.
[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:31.660] On that right.
[00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:41.660] And then they would take another small strip of the dough and they rolled it and kind of twisted it and brought it back up and made a little bowl.
[00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:42.660] And that was.
[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:43.660] Wow.
[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:44.660] You really have to know what you're doing.
[00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:45.660] That's right.
[00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:46.660] And I said that's why.
[00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:50.660] Well I made it later for Easter.
[00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:51.660] Easter I believe it was.
[00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:54.660] And it came out really good which I was surprised it was.
[00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:58.660] Well Tony did your mom or anybody in your family ever do the St. Joseph's Day table?
[00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:01.660] My mom did years ago just a small one though.
[00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:14.660] She did a small one for our oldest boy because he was born prematurely and then he had a major surgery the day after he was born and then ten months later.
[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:16.660] And then ten months later she had the table.
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:18.660] No ten months later he had another surgery.
[00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:19.660] Oh then he had.
[00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:30.660] Well his birthday is February 26th so it was almost a little over a year that she had the table in Thanksgiving because he was just hanging on by a hair for a while.
[00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:32.660] You were talking about Anthony I think.
[00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:33.660] Uh huh.
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:34.660] I sure am.
[00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:36.660] Yeah I remember that.
[00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:41.660] I remember when I was taking care of him somebody said how are you going to take care of him?
[00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:44.660] I said I ain't going to be like this you know with the surgeries and all that kind of.
[00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:45.660] He was.
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:48.660] Well he's thin as a rail.
[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:49.660] Uh huh.
[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:50.660] He was.
[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:51.660] The boys are really thin.
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:22:02.660] But I said if you'd have seen Anthony he looked like a bird with these big monstrous eyes and he wore size clothes until he was almost a year old.
[00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:03.660] Uh huh.
[00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:04.660] He was just nothing.
[00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:06.660] Well he never really ate a full meal when he was a year old.
[00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:12.660] He could have ten cc's and you know what a.
[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:13.660] He could have given him eye drops.
[00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:17.660] Uh huh yes he could not have that with his limited amount.
[00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:18.660] Now Tony Anthony.
[00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:22.660] Anthony is the son that Debbie had pinned down to the ground as a part of his case.
[00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:23.660] Yeah right.
[00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:25.660] That was really funny you weren't there but.
[00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:29.660] We were going to go get her and then we got switched around.
[00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:34.660] There was a lady with me Paula Tavarelli who's working on this project and here Debbie had
[00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:38.660] was sitting on top of Anthony like putting ice down his shirt I think.
[00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:42.660] And on top of him and Paula says are you an Italian woman?
[00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:46.660] Well I want to get a picture of how the Italian women around here treat their men.
[00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:49.660] Yeah I tell you.
[00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:50.660] That's cute.
[00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:51.660] Yeah cause.
[00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:52.660] So now this is something you handed out.
[00:22:52.660 --> 00:23:02.660] This is a story that Josephine Gagliano gave me and I guess it's been passed on down to
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:08.660] a several you know somebody had given it to her and then she gave it to me so that it's
[00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:10.660] telling you what the tradition is and you know.
[00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:11.660] So it's just the Saint Joseph's.
[00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:12.660] Uh huh and that it's the Sicilian tradition is what it says.
[00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:13.660] Uh huh.
[00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:14.660] Because it's a tradition.
[00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:15.660] It's a tradition.
[00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:16.660] It's a tradition.
[00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:17.660] It's a tradition.
[00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:18.660] It's a tradition.
[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:19.660] It's a tradition.
[00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:20.660] Uh huh.
[00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:21.660] Does it say how it got started?
[00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:22.660] It has.
[00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:23.660] Is it in that part or somewhere I have the other one and I've got a copy and I'll give
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:24.660] it to you.
[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:25.660] It has something to do with there was a famine.
[00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:26.660] Uh huh.
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:27.660] And when the famine was over then they offered the food and that to Saint Joseph.
[00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:28.660] It was drought.
[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:29.660] It was drought.
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:30.660] Yeah that's what it was.
[00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:31.660] They had a big drought.
[00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:32.660] The famine.
[00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:33.660] Okay here's what it says.
[00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:35.660] Several a severe famine in Sicily caused the death of a thousand men and the death of
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:36.660] a thousand women.
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:37.660] And the death of a thousand men.
[00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:38.660] And the death of a thousand women.
[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:39.660] And the death of a thousand women.
[00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:48.660] And that was the story for Marilyn Clare.
[00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:49.660] .
[00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:51.700] Oh Michelin's The
[00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:54.060] And the judgement at that time was that that something that could have killed wagon
[00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:55.060] asses and that something could have gotten to Favela.
[00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:56.060] Like someiedz .
[00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:57.060] So it was Sal works.
[00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:58.060] Sal.
[00:23:58.060 --> 00:23:59.060] Look it's an English introduction.
[00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:00.060] It's English exists but.
[00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:01.060] .
[00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:02.060] Our book of books is humanos.
[00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:03.060] Jesus causes.
[00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:04.060] What was David Bog emotions and it's really awesome.
[00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:05.060] I had a question for magic.
[00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:06.060] Didn'tقت that question.
[00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:07.060] What story did you tell?
[00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:08.060] It existed in Sal for about five years.
[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:09.060] 박ins.
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:18.240] Yes. And as I say, when we first started, I always thought that it had to be the names of the apostles.
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:21.840] Oh, you mean the other saints that were represented?
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:26.880] Right. And then I thought, well, you never had anything but men there.
[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:35.460] But I talked to, well, and I noticed that Josephine Gagliano, well, you had Mother Mary, always had Mother Mary.
[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:39.060] And Josephine Gagliano had several women.
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:44.380] And I was kind of under the impression they all had to be like senior citizens.
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:52.720] Well, I talked to Betsy Ingo and Josephine Gagliano, and I told them, I said, you know, I said, really?
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:25:00.860] Who said, I want to know if there would be anything wrong like having women and girls and if there were younger groups.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:01.880] And they said, no.
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:04.520] They said, really and truthfully.
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:05.220] That.
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:11.160] And, you know, you picked the saints for which purpose you wanted.
[00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:12.660] And that's what I did.
[00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:16.560] I picked saints that I felt that, you know, for certain things.
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.660] So what were these?
[00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:20.180] Well, let's see.
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:23.400] Now, St. Barbara is for storms and miners.
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.100] There's many different things.
[00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:28.180] And St. Joseph, of course, is for the families.
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.240] And then why did you pick Rose?
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:34.960] This Rose, because she has kind of a stormy temperament.
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:35.440] Oh, I see.
[00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:35.720] I see.
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:36.560] We met her yesterday.
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:37.520] Yes, that is.
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:38.640] Ron, Ron's wife.
[00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:39.760] That's Tony's sister.
[00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:40.280] Your sister.
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:43.140] And Charles Junta is a cousin of mine.
[00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:48.580] And he had just lost a daughter of his in an automobile accident in the mountains.
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:54.480] So he was, yes, I picked him for that.
[00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:57.920] Then baby Jesus was my daughter Debbie's father-in-law.
[00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:03.920] And he, like she says, nobody is holier than Moses Carleo because he goes to church all the time.
[00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:04.340] He does.
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:05.280] He really is.
[00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:08.240] He is a very, you know, he's a wonderful person.
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:11.760] But he's very strong on his religion, which is wonderful.
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.840] And then St. Rita was for loneliness.
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:16.540] And that's Tony's sister, Ann.
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:21.600] Not that she's lonely, but I would pick people to pray for these situations.
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:27.080] St. Ann is for horsemen, cabinetmakers, housekeepers, housewives.
[00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:29.420] And that is the cousin of Tony's, Ann Kachera.
[00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:34.520] And St. James, that was my brother, for arthritics and rheumatism.
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:35.440] And he suffered.
[00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:36.080] He was from Nassau.
[00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:39.660] No, I picked him to pray for all the arthritics from Nassau.
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:39.780] Okay.
[00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:42.980] St. Agnes was for the youth.
[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:45.060] And that was my daughter, Lisa.
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:49.420] Because she was younger and I felt that we needed somebody to pray for youth.
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:52.180] St. Elizabeth was the grandmother of Jesus.
[00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:54.340] And that was Tony's cousin, Jenny LaCara.
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.060] Is she an older woman?
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:56.700] Mm-hmm.
[00:26:58.580 --> 00:26:59.500] St. Christopher.
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:05.280] And I know they say that they don't know if he's still a saint or not.
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:05.380] Yeah.
[00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:06.460] And I don't know why.
[00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:10.640] But to me, he's the traveler saint.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:11.720] And I...
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:11.920] Yeah.
[00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:16.280] But they say that they're like, they don't recognize him.
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:16.560] Yeah.
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:16.860] Right.
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.500] How could you take somebody...
[00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:21.840] I remember when that happened because all my aunts were very upset.
[00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:24.040] Well, why would they do that, though?
[00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:24.380] I don't know.
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:25.440] I'm not sure.
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:28.060] I think it was maybe in the 60s, late 60s.
[00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:29.920] See, I didn't even realize they did that.
[00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:30.960] I just kept...
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:31.260] Yeah.
[00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:32.660] Oh, they kept their...
[00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:34.620] I think they made the devotion stronger.
[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:35.420] Evidently.
[00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:39.360] Because I still buy the little St. Christopher medals and that, you know.
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:41.840] St. Lucy is...
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:42.980] And women.
[00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:43.800] That was...
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:44.540] Sam Pichotta.
[00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:45.480] Yes.
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:46.480] Okay.
[00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:48.560] And he is a...
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:50.640] Well, let's see.
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:54.760] His cousin was Tony's cousin also.
[00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:57.020] Part of Tony's family were Pichottas.
[00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:00.340] Sam is not related to us, but I worked with him.
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:01.420] And he was a friend of ours.
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.160] St. Lucy was my sister.
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.280] Virginia's deaf mate.
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.700] She was a patron saint of the eyes.
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:09.340] Eyes, yes.
[00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:10.740] And she just had eye surgery.
[00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:15.400] St. Catherine, that was Katie Granato.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:17.760] And her daughter and I are friends.
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.240] And I've known Katie also.
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.140] And she's a great philosopher.
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.280] And this is the saint of philosophy.
[00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:23.780] Mm-hmm.
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:25.140] St. Jude.
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.100] And that was Nate Cordo.
[00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:28.940] The one that we spoke to.
[00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:29.040] Oh, you gave...
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:29.160] Right.
[00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:31.440] And that's for impossible situations.
[00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:33.100] That's, you know...
[00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:34.100] St. Felicitas.
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.720] Felicitas, that was our daughter Jeanette for barren women.
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:37.520] Mm-hmm.
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:39.040] Because she wants a baby.
[00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:39.780] Oh, yeah.
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.460] And she's not having any luck.
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:41.860] No.
[00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:46.520] St. Teresa was our daughter Christine,
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.160] the one that had the broken collarbone.
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:48.460] Right.
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:49.780] The little flower.
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:52.340] That's all I've ever known her as, is the little flower.
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:52.640] Uh-huh.
[00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:53.740] And...
[00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:55.560] That was your nickname for Christine?
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:55.900] No.
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:56.220] Oh.
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:57.480] No, that was St. Teresa.
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:57.700] Teresa.
[00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:00.900] And then Mother Mary was my mother.
[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:02.220] And that's Mother Jesus.
[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:02.880] Oh, you were there.
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:03.300] Yes.
[00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:03.660] Oh, yeah.
[00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:04.720] I didn't know that.
[00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:06.180] Yes, she was Mother Mary.
[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:12.540] Well, when you were younger, do you remember any Italians around who did the St. Joseph's Day table?
[00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:13.700] Oh, yeah.
[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:18.920] I remember some, but there wasn't quite many because my husband and I went to see one.
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:19.940] Mm-hmm.
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:21.840] We decided we better go see one.
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:22.340] Mm-hmm.
[00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:23.940] Yeah, it was way back there.
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:25.660] Yeah.
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:30.560] But this is just something, like the Slovenians never did anything like this.
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:30.620] No.
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.660] Is there a special saint, though, that...
[00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:35.960] Is it especially dear to the Slovenians?
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:42.480] Well, I think that St. Joseph's is probably the closest I can figure out.
[00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:42.800] Right.
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:43.760] Yeah.
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:49.000] Now they're, you know, they're doing a lot of studying on that Medjugorje.
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:49.460] Right.
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:53.960] And one of the parishioners just came back from there, and she...
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:58.440] I meant to keep her right up, because she had told us about some of the things that
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:00.180] they had seen at the sightings.
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:00.560] Mm-hmm.
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:03.300] And I said, really, you know, it's just a small town.
[00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:07.580] But they were talking about, like, the moon and the sun, how the different things that
[00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:08.380] happened with it.
[00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:10.440] And I said, really, it would be something.
[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:12.080] Yeah, I know someone who went.
[00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:12.680] Do you?
[00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:13.660] Who went to see it.
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:20.300] Several years ago, I had read an article in the newspaper about...
[00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:28.060] I don't even know what religion this man was, but he just decided he was going to go put
[00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:30.220] an end to these tales and that.
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:30.320] Mm-hmm.
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:31.320] He was not Catholic.
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:32.440] Mm-hmm.
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:33.280] And he went...
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:36.960] He went over there, and since then, he has become very devoted to it.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.180] He says he has never in his life experienced anything like that.
[00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:40.460] Right.
[00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:40.560] Right.
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.760] But he just feared it was all false.
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:43.140] Right, right.
[00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:44.780] And he was going to, you know...
[00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:45.720] Yeah, expose everybody.
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:48.920] Expose everybody for this, and he says he has...
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.720] It just completely changed him around.
[00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:51.040] Wow.
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:52.520] So...
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:52.540] Wow.
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:56.600] So then we go on to, like I told you...
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:57.080] Yeah, the...
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:58.240] We've got that.
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:30:59.900] And the recipes and stuff.
[00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:00.280] Right.
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:00.400] Yeah.
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:03.120] We have the big cookies.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:07.440] We have the filbert poppies, which that came out of a recipe book of mine.
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:09.800] I have recipes all over.
[00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:10.240] Mm-hmm.
[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:12.820] Some kind of my own idea.
[00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:13.320] Uh-huh.
[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:20.340] Now, the piñalachas and the spinges, Jenny gave you the recipe that was her mother's.
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:22.100] These are in...
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:28.860] I think it was Better Homes and Gardens that had a little tiny bit on the St. Joseph's
[00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:31.780] Big Table, but it didn't have much, and it was, oh, back in 82.
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:32.420] Huh.
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:34.000] And...
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:34.680] And so you get these...
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:38.460] Now, the piñalachas, are those the things that are shaped like a cone?
[00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:39.080] Yeah.
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:41.000] Is this little ball stuck together?
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:41.640] No, no, no, no.
[00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:43.520] The piñalacha is...
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:45.080] Is the honey balls.
[00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:46.460] Well, they're...
[00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:48.100] But then do you stick them together?
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:50.840] Yeah, but you're talking about the cannolis.
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:52.860] No, these are...
[00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:53.320] No, no, no.
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:55.920] They're little balls about like that, and they're stuck...
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:03.340] See?
[00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:10.740] Yeah.
[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:11.320] Oh, my God.
[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:11.860] So, where are we?
[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:12.380] Oh, that's awful.
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:15.720] I love collecting にどのパンで打いたの。
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:19.620] One of the other items was about lineup, and I have all trying to guess explosion.
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:22.680] So, did you usepiece, as I'm thinking?
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:23.880] Sure have I.
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:29.420] Then these pieces here look like, you know, as if they were geometry in that look and
[00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:31.240] on the bottom...
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:33.020] These are gonna be knit and they did this sandwich with them.
[00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:33.160] And then yeah, I thought that was...
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:33.200] You know?
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:33.900] you
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:03.900] you
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:33.900] you
