[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000] Does anyone know what that is? Does anyone not know?
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000] That thing come out of a packing plant.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000] That come out of your...
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000] Come out of the Bloomberg of the New York Times.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000] Either Arm and Chipper or all this come out of the tobacco warehouse.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000] The tobacco cart, right.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000] I have not yet seen a tobacco basket, by the way, and if anyone knows of one I can look at.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000] There's plenty of them.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000] There's plenty of them. I got one in my house.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000] I'd like to see one.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000] I've got one in the back of my house.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000] Now this is something that I have a special interest in.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000] Pie safe.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000] My wife, who lives in Indiana and is there right now,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000] has been trying to study pie safes in particular for a long time.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000] We have a good many questions about them.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000] In Indiana, a screen-fronted safe is a very rare thing.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000] Here it seems to be the most common type of safe.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000] I'd like to know if anyone has any information or can tell me anything about pie safes
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000] or if you remember buying them from the store.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000] If you remember parents or grandparents having them.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000] I'd really like to know where they got them, when, where they made it home, and so on and so on.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000] Instead of using glasses, put tin up there and decorate the figures.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000] Decorate the hole.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000] Why haven't I seen a single punch tin one here?
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000] We have one in the same name.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000] You do? I'd like to see.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000] We've got better off.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000] Take a picture.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000] As I said, we're interested in traditional oddities.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000] We have objects of all kinds, such as this fire dog.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000] Fire dog is what you call it here and iron elsewhere.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000] The terms vary all the way down to the lowliest sorts of objects.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000] There's even differences, believe it or not, regional differences in how you build a hog trough
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000] and how you build a cattle feeder.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000] I've amazed people by taking pictures of these things.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000] They say,
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000] What on earth are you looking at that for?
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000] But you try to find documentation somewhere for a hog trough of 1750.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000] Just try it.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000] We're providing it.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000] We're interested in mule barns.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000] And some of the things that we see in farm buildings generally carry over into the houses.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000] The break in the roof line that we see in these mule barns time and again shows up in houses here.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000] Is there an explanation for that?
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000] Yeah.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000] You put hay in the middle part up there.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000] But why would you build a house with the same break in the roof line?
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000] Because consistently the shed additions to houses will also show that break.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.000] Lots of times they build a center one first and you add the other one on and that's about doing it.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000] The best way you can add on to it is to drop down.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000] Well, you add on is the easiest way to handle your screw thing.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000] I see.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000] All right.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000] Well, we'll start asking people about that.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000] That I suppose is a good question.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000] That I suppose is very familiar.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000] We've been looking at tobacco barns.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000] I photographed Merle's without asking permission and she'll never forgive me.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000] It's not a log.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000] It feels great without a log.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000] Well, log ones.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000] And this is a log barn too way down inside it.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000] The man that built this built it in the 1930s and he told me that it was a one of a kind building.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000] And of course it is.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000] But it isn't.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000] Well, he believes it is.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000] And I honestly think he's quite sincere in believing that this is a log barn.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000] In believing that this is a unique building and yet in southern Virginia, North Carolina,
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000] eastern Tennessee, southern Ohio, you'll find hundreds of buildings built exactly the way
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000] this one is inside.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000] So sometimes the...
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000] Did you tear it down?
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000] Huh?
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.000] I told him that I'd seen other buildings like it and then he said, well, may have.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000] And then he proceeded to tell me about how he designed this one.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000] And it may be a case of independent invention of the same idea.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000] It's a double pen, a double crib barn really.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000] Two square cribs surrounded with all these sheds.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000] And that is a very common type.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:13.000] He pointed out the things that were important to him as making it different were the raised opening there at the front.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000] He built this barn so low that you can't drive into it anywhere but there.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000] You can't drive out of it at all.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000] But...
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000] Okay.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:30.000] But barns, pack houses like that one, old barber shops, all sorts of buildings fascinated us.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000] We're interested in architecture.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000] Not only are we interested in architecture, we're interested in the things that go around architecture.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:45.000] We're interested in the ways in which people build landscapes in which to contain their houses, in which to display their houses.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000] Part of that was covered by Dave when he mentioned the way a front porch lowered.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000] Right.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000] The way a front porch looks with chairs.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000] The front porch, the front yard is presented almost as a painting.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000] And people worry about the way a front yard looks.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000] They'll sweep the yard, mule the way, or in modern times, grow grass, grow lawn.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:18.000] We've found people consistently doing some very interesting sorts of things around here in ways that would emphasize their front porch.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:27.000] This is the backyard of a man who was also interesting because he makes these birdhouses.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000] This is Cecil Bridges who lives at Indian Lake, not very far from here at all.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000] And he got into the birdhouse business after having a heart attack.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000] He never did it before.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000] And he also made some little models like this church that his wife asked him to make.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000] We'll find people that will express through self-taught art.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000] They'll express actually something about the identity of your region.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000] And the thing is, a good number of Mr. Bridges' birdhouses are not really remarkable.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000] They're made from plans that he got from popular mechanics.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000] And so that doesn't really speak to the folk life of this area.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000] That would be the popular culture, perhaps.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000] But at the same time, the same man is taking in the locale in which he lives.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000] So he built this model church.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000] He's built a number of birdhouse designs.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000] That are based on saddlebags houses and tobacco barns.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000] He builds tobacco barn birdhouses.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000] He's built these more unique and interesting ones as well.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000] Of course, there's other kinds of traditions around here.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000] A good many of you have seen that kind of birdhouse.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000] There's lots of them around.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000] I've been asking if anyone can tell me where I can buy a Martin house like that.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000] A Gordon Martin house.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000] Thomasville Road.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000] Where?
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000] Just where you get your pawns.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000] Just beyond the airport.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000] Alright.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000] Stow.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000] Thank you.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000] E.G. Stow.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000] Thank you.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000] I've been looking.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000] I want to take one of those home just personally.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000] I like them.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000] I got some on here.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000] Alright.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000] That's better than buying it any day.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000] He doesn't have any sale now anyway.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000] He's all sold out.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000] Are they?
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000] The way in which we go about these investigations, it's interesting.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000] This is Merle.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000] When we went over to visit Mr. Josh Tillman, he was a very good friend of mine.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000] He was a very good friend of mine.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000] He was a very good friend of mine.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000] He was a very good friend of mine.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000] He was a very good friend of mine.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000] He was a very good friend of mine.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000] He was a very good friend of mine.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000] I want to tell you, this is Merle.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.420] When we went over to visit Mr. Josh Tillman and get him to tell us about some of the things
[00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:28.220] he remembered about his boyhood and about growing up between Ellenson and, well, between
[00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:33.500] Ellenson and Berlin, near Babro over there.
[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.120] Mr. Tillman was really a great teacher.
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.320] He had a great deal he could tell me.
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.980] And Merle asked a number of questions as well.
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:51.100] I think it's important to regard oneself and one's neighbors as real resource people
[00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.760] in folk life.
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:08:02.220] This is perhaps the greatest possibility of this entire field is beginning to view one's
[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:06.660] everyday knowledge as important.
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:12.960] Mr. Tillman, by speaking to us, by pointing out his...
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:13.960] The kitchen of his...
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:14.960] Was it his father's?
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.960] Grandfather's house, I believe, could tell us about some of the details of construction,
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:26.920] could tell us about what it was like, a little bit about what it was like, some of his stories
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.420] growing up in this part of the country.
[00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:34.840] And that's important because it tends to fill out the historic record of names and dates
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:38.880] in a very meaningful way.
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.660] We were really delighted by the day.
[00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:41.660] I was delighted by the day.
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:42.660] And I think Merle was too.
[00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:42.740] I think Merle was too.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.840] He's the one who spent in part with Mr. Tillman.
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:49.600] He showed us the kitchen there that's all that's left.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.060] The other side of the...
[00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:57.100] Of this building where the big house used to stand now looks like this.
[00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.680] That's all that's there.
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:05.440] And across the road is one of these little sort of run down, unimportant looking houses
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.840] that's a bungalow house with two front doors.
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.660] It's very similar to that very unfancy house that I showed you.
[00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:19.260] you a while back. But in this case, I was able to ask Mr. Tillman and his daughter a
[00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:26.260] little bit about the design. He didn't really fully explain why there were two front doors
[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:33.100] to this house and I still don't know quite why. But, do you really think it was for,
[00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:39.900] to let your wife go in one door? Well, we're interested not only in houses, not only in
[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:46.360] dwelling places, not only in farm buildings, but also in churches. In relatively well kept
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:53.360] up fancy churches, in less fancy churches. We're interested in all sorts of churches.
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:58.140] We're interested in religion and religious life in this area because it is very important.
[00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:03.220] It's important, of course, in many places in the country, but it looms very large in
[00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:08.180] people's lives here. So we're extremely interested in it. We're interested in people's feelings
[00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.880] about membership in a church.
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:16.880] And we're interested in the way a church helps tie a community together.
[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:24.300] We're not entirely devoid of interest for things that are unique. There's no way I could
[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:30.160] walk through a cemetery and ignore that.
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:37.160] So wherever we find landmarks, things that are meaningful, and sure enough, I talked
[00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:39.620] to some people in,
[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:43.300] in Colquitt County before, I think it was before I even met Merle, I had heard about
[00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:50.300] this elephant. Someone else mentioned it to me. I think one of the journalists in Tipton
[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:56.040] gave me a newspaper clipping on it and Merle said, let's go by there. I want to show you
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:02.440] something. And so I had, I think four or five different people pointed this out to me. We're
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:08.060] interested in landmarks and things that, that draw people together, that form the basis
[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:08.560] of conversation and of understanding. And so I think that's what we're interested in.
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:09.060] Let's tour this place.
[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:14.960] Well, earlier my point, I mentioned earlier that there's a lot of some sort of
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:23.220] گ
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:32.400] of
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.520] ,
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.360] what do we have?
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:37.520] So, well, theuk , I think, there's so many of us in the community that we scenes are such long Bayernwiefer. We see so
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:37.880] there's so many people on the !n
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:38.400] Medlife-
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:50.540] them around. And there are a number of practices that pose questions for us. We've seen broken
[00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:58.060] objects, seen wooden grave markers, but this is something we're wondering about again.
[00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:02.740] I want to finish up these two slides with a few questions. One of them is this business
[00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:09.840] of shells. We've been told before we ever got here that we would find shells in black
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:17.380] graveyards. That's turned out not to be so. Not always. We've found shells in all sorts
[00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:24.240] of graveyards. And again, I'm just asking for information. Why do people put shells
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.240] on graves?
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:30.240] They're lasting and they'll be there next time you come in.
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.240] Because they'll last?
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.240] Last.
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:32.740] Last.
[00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:33.740] Last.
[00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:39.740] The first thing that I have to explain is because in the early days the Christian symbol
[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:44.740] was a pig, and the shell would be worked back to the seat and indicate that that person
[00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:51.740] was a Christian. That's one reason why I've been giving you a go through of it.
[00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:57.740] Did people make special trips to the coast to get shells or would they just bring some
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:00.740] back when they came from down there?
[00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:01.740] People have them.
[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:02.240] They do it sometimes.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.240] They do it when they come back.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.240] They do it when they come back.
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.240] There are a lot of stories of the story is closed.
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:12.240] Another, another along that same line that I've found being a lesson to some of you,
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:19.240] especially in North Georgia again, is a lot of kerosene lamps from Adelaide last year
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:22.240] were being placed at the foot of the grave.
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:28.240] And I asked about that, and the reasons I was given for that was somewhere in the Bible
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.240] they were related to the word of God being a lamp unto their feet.
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.240] So they would place a lamp there and show them away.
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.240] Thank you.
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:42.240] These are all helpful responses really because we see these things as mysteries, not only
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:47.240] because we're outsiders, but there are literally other people wondering about these things.
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:52.240] It's not only that shells are seen in South Georgia, it's seen in a number of places,
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.240] but they were particularly striking here sometimes.
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:59.240] Well I had a couple other questions to finish up with.
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.240] The first one was what's this big thing?
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.240] The first one was what's this building?
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:07.240] If anyone can tell me, this is an agricultural building of some kind.
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.240] I've got a view in the end.
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:14.240] I don't know if it's just storage or what, but the other end of it from what you're seeing is a building.
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.240] This was way out in the country, away from anything else.
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.240] Oh no, not anything.
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:24.240] There was one of those simple pyramid square houses near it, but that's all.
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:29.240] Isn't that stalled in the bottom?
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:36.240] Well it looks like it may have been stalls at this end, but the other end of it is closed off.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.240] I'm sorry that I don't have a better picture.
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:41.240] You can see at the right, it's closed in.
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.240] Chicken houses.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:48.240] There weren't many great big barns collapsing at this point.
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:52.240] And they had mules, and some of them had stalls and some of them had open.
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.240] So you think this may be a mule barn?
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.240] Well it could be.
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.240] Mule unemployment.
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.240] All right.
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.240] Well that was one thing.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.240] And then I had a final question.
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:10.240] This is off there in the evening at Preston Newell's when the music slowed down.
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.240] And there's nothing remarkable about that cake.
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:16.240] I guess the only thing that's remarkable is that there's any left.
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:24.240] But I put this up there because I wanted to draw some attention, draw your attention to one final area that I'm working on particularly.
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:27.240] I'm trying to describe South Georgia's...
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:30.240] South Georgia's traditional food ways.
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:35.240] And of course that's something I take a deep personal interest in.
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:51.240] But in addition, I want to ask you if any of you can tell me either now or afterwards, this is my last slide, but afterwards, if you can think of what are the foods that might most symbolize or stand for this part of Georgia.
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:56.240] Not only is there anything that really, really symbolizes South Central Georgia.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.240] Or even Calvert County.
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:02.240] Did you find a cane mill with a mule?
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.240] With a mule?
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.240] Yeah.
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.240] We've seen cane mills running.
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.240] Well you have a show.
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.240] Oh yeah, I know that was a late one.
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:12.240] But the mule was a center of activity.
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:18.240] Oh we have some pictures of those as well.
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:25.240] And in fact, I'd like to see one, you know, we'd like to have the whole record of them all the way.
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:30.240] Mules, tractor run ones like the one I showed and gasoline driven ones.
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:34.240] The mule ones were first.
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.240] The two roller mill.
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.240] Then later three roller.
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:43.240] You're talking about the standards of food. Black-eyed peas and hogs' jolts.
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.240] Black-eyed peas and hogs' jolts.
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.240] That's my New Year's Day recipe.
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:53.240] Cornbreads and turnip greens.
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.240] Call it.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.240] Black-eyed peas and hogs' jolts.
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.240] Sweet potatoes.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.240] Sweet potatoes.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.240] Thank you.
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.240] Well it came around the day I was home.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.240] Well it's down the road.
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.240] I went to the legislature.
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:11.240] Well let me just say one last word then about the project.
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:16.240] I didn't see any of those pretty homes that you know.
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.240] I didn't show any pictures of pretty homes.
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.240] You're really going to give a beautiful impression.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:23.240] But there's books full of pictures of pretty homes.
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.240] I don't appreciate this.
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:32.240] I think really our message is it's very important that those homes that aren't pretty are important too.
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.240] I really feel that very strongly.
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:41.240] That homes, really the poorest, saddest, sorriest homes, it's not that we're trying to give an impression.
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:44.240] How would they know that we have beautiful homes?
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.240] Well there are beautiful school houses and beautiful churches.
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:49.240] Everybody has them.
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.240] I think there are a great many books.
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:58.240] In fact there's a poster right outside here in the library called the Architectural Heritage of Georgia.
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:00.240] What's that book you're saying?
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.240] Early Georgia.
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:05.240] There are a great many such books and those things are important.
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:09.240] I'm not saying that the beautiful high style things aren't unimportant.
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:14.240] I'm saying that there's more to history than the most beautiful things.
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:20.240] History doesn't, it seems to me, and it's why it can't look only at the nicest side of things.
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:23.240] Somebody else will record all those beautiful things.
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:25.240] You're only trying to get stuff into somebody else's mind.
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:27.240] We're not ignoring the beautiful things too.
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:38.240] And our view of history and of folk life doesn't necessarily cut off beautiful things or ugly things.
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:41.240] And it also doesn't cut off any particular time in the past.
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:49.240] We're interested in the historic materials of 1977 as well as those of 1877 or 17.
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:50.240] Right.
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.240] Why are you doing this all over the United States?
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:57.240] Well, in a way, folklorists are working all over the United States.
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:01.240] Organized projects like this have only been done in a few places.
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:06.240] And the American Folklife Center has only sponsored the two, as David mentioned before.
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:10.240] One is Chicago, which was a different sort of survey entirely.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:19.240] They were focusing on ethnic arts, survey of the arts and traditions of people from a great many countries that live in an urban area.
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:25.240] Here, we're really trying to capture something, if we can, of the regional identity of this place.
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:32.240] One of the questions we really have is, is this area that we're working in, is this a region?
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:40.240] Is this really a significant region that's different, say, from the counties to the east of it or to the west of it or just to the north or to the south?
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:47.240] We've asked a lot of questions about Wiregrass, Georgia, since we were told, some people told us this was the Wiregrass region.
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.240] That's what was different.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:51.240] The Wiregrass is gone in many ways.
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:58.240] So, we want to still know what's distinctive about this part of Georgia.
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.240] What is it like?
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:08.240] We're really trying to produce a record of life in 1977 and remembered life from earlier years in the middle south of Georgia.
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.240] Well, this area was developed about the same time.
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:12.240] It was the last.
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.240] It was the last.
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.240] And you know why the Wiregrass disappeared in Georgia?
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.240] Why?
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.240] Ha ha.
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:22.240] Well, it brought in a lot of power and grass, went raising cattle, beef cattle.
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:27.240] Used to, you didn't have much beef cattle in here, it was just those sheep, wasn't it?
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.240] So, the cattle ate it all up?
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.240] No, and the cattle, that's the Wiregrass, this other grass.
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:35.240] Well, when you destroy the Wiregrass, it doesn't come back.
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:37.240] That's right, it killed it, hey?
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:42.240] The botanists say it's very, they say it cannot be reestablished.
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.240] Really?
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.240] That's a shame.
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.240] It's still a little, it's still a little.
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.240] There's still some.
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:48.240] There's still some, there's still some.
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.240] It's a wire film.
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.240] It's a 100-luck.
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:54.240] We discovered a good many people couldn't identify Wiregrass for us at all.
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.240] Finally, Merle's father showed me some Wiregrass.
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:01.240] He labeled it.
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:07.240] Well, that's, that's just what we've tried to show you is really just at the surface,
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.240] I'd say, of what we've been looking at.
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:17.240] And there's, there's been a number of special pet projects within this, an independent investigation
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.240] special things that we've been looking at.
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:27.240] David has gone much more deeply into, into the singing conventions than his own comments
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.240] would indicate.
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:34.240] One of us in particular, Howard Marshall, is really quite an expert on folk architecture
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:42.240] and is, I hope, going to produce a nice document dealing with not only the traditional houses
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.240] but traditional church architecture in this area.
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:52.240] And if I can get some of the, enough material, I hope to really write something about the
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.240] foodways in this area.
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:59.240] So, as I say, anything that, if any of you want to stay and talk afterwards, we'll be
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.240] delighted to.
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:03.240] Will this be on permanent file in the Library of Congress?
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:07.240] This'll all be, it'll all be on permanent file, permanently stored in the Library of
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:08.240] Congress.
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:14.240] And in addition, a selected set of the materials from this project will also be housed at ABAC
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.240] in the library.
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.240] So, that's the way it's going to be.
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:21.240] Will you publish publications that will be on sale to public?
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:25.240] I'm not sure it's really decided about what publications will come out of this.
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:31.240] And I think anything that does emerge will be available to the public, yes.
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.240] We don't really know quite what we're going to produce.
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:38.240] We, we're pretty sure we'll write some articles that, there may be one book of selected studies
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.240] that emerges.
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.240] In addition, as Dave said, there may be some recordings.
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:44.240] Some of the, you know, some of the stories we've been told are too good to be published.
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:45.240] Too good to keep to ourselves.
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.240] There, and, yeah.
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.240] Are you familiar with the little college in North Georgia that the English teacher has
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.240] been getting out this book, Foxfire?
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.240] Elliot Wiginton, yeah.
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.240] Raven Gant.
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.240] Yeah, very familiar with that.
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.240] And we're really, the work we're doing is very, very much like the students, like Elliot
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.240] Wiginton's students do.
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:58.240] We're trying to do, sometimes we're trying to do a more thorough job in certain areas
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.240] than they do.
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.240] But it's the same kind of work.
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.240] We've seen it in the library.
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.240] We've seen it in the library.
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.240] We've seen it in the library.
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:04.240] We've seen it in the library.
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.240] We've seen it in the library.
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:06.240] We've seen it in the library.
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.240] We've seen it in the library.
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.240] We've seen it in the library.
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:13.040] Sometimes we're trying to do a more thorough job in certain areas than they do.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.740] But it's the same kind of work exactly.
[00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:23.340] It's the feeling that what our neighbors and friends and elders have to say is important.
[00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:27.080] That's the way in which we're trying to amplify the historic written record.
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:30.000] That's what the Coke Life is all about.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000] So thank you for your attention.
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.240] Thank you very much.
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:40.240] Now you're all going to be around to talk to people.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.240] We hope so.
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.240] As long as anyone wants to talk.
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.240] We're going to tell him about cooning and muddying.
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:44.240] Not talking.
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.240] Right?
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:46.240] Well, yeah.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.240] Any board raid around here, they're going to have to tune and muddying.
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.240] Where's that tape?
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.240] Right here.
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.240] Anything else to come for the Society at this time?
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.240] No.
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.240] No.
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.240] No.
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.240] No.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.240] No.
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.240] No.
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.240] No.
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.240] No.
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.240] No.
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.240] No.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.240] No.
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.240] No.
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.240] No.
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.240] No.
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.240] No.
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:06.240] No.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.240] No.
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:08.240] No.
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.240] No.
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:10.240] No.
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:11.240] No.
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.240] No.
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.240] So now we're all excited.
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.240] Go.
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.240] Go.
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.240] Go.
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:17.240] Dr. tutto buon anno.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.240] Buon anno.
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.240] Take care.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.240] Have fun.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.240] But you helped some people.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.700] Turn it on immediately after the next verse.
[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:24.700] Follow me.
[00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:25.240] око
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.460] A такую Effects東
[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:34.640] Not as one like espaço
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.880] Five
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:38.220] Trans
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:42.240] he'll have to be up there the rest of his life
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:46.240] because he's going to see two more arthritis doctors
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:50.240] and better than him get on with him
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:54.240] if somebody tells how Mr. Cater is
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:58.240] about Cater's father
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:02.240] anybody heard of Robert Cater?
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:06.240] he's able to get up and walk
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:10.240] he'll have to stay for about three weeks
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:14.240] and he'll sit most of the time when he's up there
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:18.240] Tom faces God in a hurry
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:22.240] and he certainly faces God at night
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:26.240] and I know that lots of you have stories that you can tell Tom and Dave
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:30.240] and so if you will please stay and talk with them
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:34.240] for a while so at this time thank you for coming
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.240] we'll adjourn the meeting
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.240] thank you
