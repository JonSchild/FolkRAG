[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.400] And this program was something that was set up by Al Ruffo?
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:20.880] I would guess at Al Ruffo, but probably at their, I bet you that our fathers probably talked with him about doing that in the early estate planning.
[00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:28.000] How it came up, I mean, I wasn't there, but like I say, it was just a fact of life.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.060] That that's what they wanted to do, was to pass these properties and the shares of stock of San Martin on to the generation during their lifetimes.
[00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:43.720] Which, just from my recollections in law, a lot of Italian families did not do that.
[00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.240] There are a lot of Italian families, the Sebastianis for one, that have held everything in the mother and father.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.200] And there are some others around that really have not gone through that type of program.
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.700] Do you think that's made your family more flexible?
[00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.100] In terms of meeting the changing conditions?
[00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.500] I think it's given everyone a sense of ownership.
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:17.040] I think what it's done, I think it's brought some of the stronger members of the family kind of to the forefront and allowed them to kind of carry it on.
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.800] As opposed to other families, like John alludes to, where it's kind of all held in the first generation.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.800] And that generation gets older and doesn't want to take risks and do things.
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.300] And it just kind of sits there and doesn't go anywhere.
[00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.500] We've been there.
[00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.800] Yeah.
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.600] We don't, as you can tell, we don't have a large operating entity.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.000] Let's say like the Sebastiani family would have a large operating entity that was going on.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:51.600] And you can see, by the way, like we went to Bellarmine and Santa Clara, where in the course of our education, almost every Italian family, their kids ended up at Bellarmine.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.400] It was a boarding school, a high school, and Mike Mondavi was there, and Fred Franzi from the Franzias.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.800] A lot of white families.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.040] Sebastiani's.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.700] And we all went to Bellarmine.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.300] And we went to Santa Clara.
[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.800] And we went to the Crabari.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.160] Crabari's.
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.000] Everybody, I mean, at Bellarmine, it was half the wine industry was sitting in class.
[00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.280] I mean, I used to sit behind Fred Franzi for four years.
[00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.820] You know, Mike Mondavi was a class behind me, et cetera.
[00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.820] You know, we all knew each other from those days.
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:24.820] But, you know, one thing that, like what Tim was alluding to, our family managed to avoid the real squabbles like you saw in the Mondavi family or just recently in the Sebastiani's.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.040] And I think it's because of the compromise.
[00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.380] Maybe this gifting program had a certain aspect to it.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:43.360] So it could be a two-edged sword where the younger generation now or these others that are not involved would want to liquidate or get something out of the properties.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.880] But generally, everyone's been very patient about it because everyone's off in their own businesses and their own activities.
[00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:56.740] And they're not looking at this company particularly to make or rather the family properties to earn a lot of income for them.
[00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.580] And I think they've also learned something over the years about California property values.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.560] I think our fathers were good about instilling the work ethic.
[00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.920] You know, they all were hardworking guys that made their money in agriculture and were used to putting in long hours.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.740] And I think they instilled, I think throughout the family, not just us three, there's a good work ethic.
[00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.560] And they encouraged people to go out and learn things and do things, et cetera.
[00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.380] I'm still a little bit confused.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.960] Is there one entity, one business entity that continues to hold all the branches of the family together?
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.780] We have quite a few.
[00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.760] We have like what we call Felisa State Vineyards, which was the old San Martin Vineyards Company,
[00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.900] which we changed the name after we sold the winery so there would not be confusion.
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.680] Felisa State Vineyards owns properties that are mainly in agriculture.
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:55.380] The cherry orchards, the FEV owns about, I don't know, maybe 400 acres of property.
[00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.480] Or not, no, not quite that much, what I'm saying.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.200] We sold some off, 100, maybe 200 acres.
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.780] And what we did is we took, in the course of the gifting program,
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.080] we looked at properties where we felt there was a strong urban potential.
[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.060] And we started to gift those properties off.
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.160] So most of the properties in Gilroy, for instance, this piece here, the piece we're on,
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.180] the main ranch, which we call the Glen Loma Ranch back here, which is about 500 acres,
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.680] those were all gifted through several entities.
[00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:31.660] Castlewood Commercial Limited Partnership, Thomas Road Limited Partnerships, Felisa Family Estate Limited Partnership,
[00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.600] we just created limited partnerships.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.440] And then the units of these partnerships would be gifted out.
[00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.740] And do those limited partnerships tend to extend across the branches of the family, like Glen Loma?
[00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.280] Yeah, there's five, like each one, there's five families involved.
[00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.560] So each one has one general partner from each family.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.540] And then everybody else is limited partners.
[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.640] Some are third generation members, some are fourth generation members.
[00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.740] And, uh...
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.140] A bigger partner?
[00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:00.240] Yeah.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.920] Sure.
[00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.640] Can I hold it?
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.140] I can see.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.620] Yeah.
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.520] It's okay.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.020] Say something about Italians.
[00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.020] How's it like to work for Italians?
[00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.580] You said you had a certain assignment to be done by 10?
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.740] Oh, geez.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.140] Yeah, let me take a break.
[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.460] Is it 10.15?
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:27.480] Yeah, it's 10.15.
[00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.160] Make it wait a few minutes.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.980] We'll try to wrap up today.
[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.520] We've got 20, 30 minutes.
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:38.740] Going back to your father's generation, were there like sort of family councils of war?
[00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.620] Yeah, the Friday afternoon meeting at the wine range was always a good one.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.780] They would get together every Friday afternoon and just kind of sit around and talk about things.
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:54.820] And sometimes they made decisions, but most of the time it was kind of a status touch base type of thing.
[00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.460] And this was in an office.
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.140] I had to set the scene here where they all worked in the same office.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.260] Same room.
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.600] And they pushed all their desks together.
[00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:10.940] So we were sitting around an office with desks in the middle, chairs all around the side, and the whole family in the room,
[00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.160] which was just inside the secretarial pool.
[00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.760] And all the yelling and screaming would take place.
[00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.460] And I think the secretaries probably thought, God, what the hell is going on in there?
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.640] Yeah.
[00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.420] But those were fun meetings, too, because stories would be told.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.440] And we'd have to discuss where the winery was going.
[00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.060] And we'd have to discuss where the wine was coming from.
[00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.420] And I think that was what we were seeing in the next five years while we cut salami and ate some bread and drank some wine.
[00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:36.440] That was all part of it.
[00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.580] Very strong tradition in our family.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.400] At first we eat, then we do business.
[00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.460] And so the repast became a very big part of it.
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.960] And today, nothing's changed.
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:54.860] One member of the younger generation would stand up and make a big pitch about how we need to buy a new label printer or something.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.300] And he'd be in with all the fathers making his point.
[00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:00.460] And somebody would say...
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.280] Please pass me the salami.
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.760] That would be the end of that.
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.960] Did women in the family have any voice about where the business was going?
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.320] Not too much, no.
[00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:12.880] Pretty traditional.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.360] Married pretty passive women.
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:23.520] So that continues to carry over into this generation as far as the way meetings are conducted?
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.620] I would say to some degree, yeah.
[00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:27.400] Well, the big...
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.740] When we have our older cousins here...
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.520] We generally meet in this room.
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.020] It's a little more formal than it was back then.
[00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.020] But we still all have a good time.
[00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:45.020] And so it's all a very friendly type of thing.
[00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.020] What about outside of the business?
[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.020] Does the family have get-togethers?
[00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.020] Oh yeah.
[00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.020] What kind?
[00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.020] Well, what was it?
[00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.020] Last year or the year before we had a big family party?
[00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:59.020] Yeah, we had been having one big family bash a year.
[00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.020] Where everybody came.
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:05.020] And for instance, one year we got ponies for the kids to ride.
[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:08.020] And we brought them all out to the ranch and did hay rides for them.
[00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.020] And that's a fair amount of people in our family.
[00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:13.020] Because there are five different families and they've all...
[00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:16.020] So we're probably talking about maybe what?
[00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.020] About 120, 130 people.
[00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:23.020] And of course the holidays are big time.
[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:26.020] But the families are so big now that we really don't...
[00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:29.020] The five families really don't get together other than maybe that one time a year.
[00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.020] Or one year.
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.020] Or a wedding or a funeral or something like that.
[00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:36.020] And now that the older generation has passed away,
[00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:40.020] that has taken away an aspect of it that sort of held it all together.
[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:46.020] And I think that those get-togethers will probably be a little bit fewer and far between now.
[00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:51.020] But the five families individually, I think to varying degrees,
[00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:58.020] still have that real closeness and celebrate all the events.
[00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.020] Well, tell us more about that.
[00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.020] In your particular family, what are those events?
[00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.020] When do they happen and what do you do?
[00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:06.020] Those events are constant in my family.
[00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:11.020] We have a pretty big family, a lot of kids and so forth.
[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:17.020] And so even though one of our sisters, one of my siblings lives down in Southern California,
[00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:20.020] we get together for all the holidays.
[00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:26.020] And then in addition to that, my brother, my two brothers are relatively close.
[00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.020] So we're together quite a bit.
[00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:32.020] Plus, I'm together with these two guys.
[00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:33.020] Constantly all the time.
[00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:35.020] We're always doing something.
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:39.020] We have the Mustacholi Club and the Calamari Club.
[00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:42.020] And we get together with different people.
[00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:46.020] But the three of us are almost inseparable in that regard.
[00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:55.020] In fact, we just put on a big feed for one of our, I hesitate to call him a tenant,
[00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.020] but he shares office space with us.
[00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.020] A close associate.
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:01.020] He's an attorney, a guy by the name of Freddy Domino,
[00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:05.020] who's, despite the fact that he's Sicilian, is a real nice guy.
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.020] Don't print that.
[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:11.020] But we just had a 50th birthday party for him.
[00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:17.020] And we tried to make it the most amazing gastronomical event that has ever been put on.
[00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:19.020] And I think we got pretty close.
[00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:21.020] In fact, we have some photographs.
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.020] It was quite an event.
[00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.020] We did it over at John's house.
[00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:30.020] We really pulled out all the stops on the Italian cooking.
[00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:34.020] What's the Calamari Club and the Mustacholi Club?
[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.020] Calamari Club actually doesn't meet much anymore.
[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:41.020] But that was basically the three of us and a couple of other people that got together about once a month
[00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:47.020] and generally went down to Monterey on a Friday and burned a Friday afternoon on the wharf.
[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:54.020] The Garlic Festival had a lot to do with fueling, you know, in an Italian family, food,
[00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.020] especially in our family with wine.
[00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:59.020] As our background, food is sort of part of your culture.
[00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:04.020] And in this area, the Garlic Festival got going, was it 11 years ago?
[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:11.020] And it was sort of the gourmet alley aspect, the food aspect of the Garlic Festival was to a large degree
[00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:17.020] started by some of our relatives who brought over some of the old recipes from Italy and started cooking.
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:22.020] And in this case, calamari was one of the things that southern Italians happened to eat.
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.020] And so back then, we were doing that.
[00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:24.020] And so we were doing that.
[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:31.020] And so back at the inception of the Garlic Festival, these calamari recipes became very popular.
[00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.020] And so we started to kind of play off of that.
[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:40.020] And we got a little group of people together that would get together probably every two or three months and have a little lunch.
[00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:46.020] Sometimes we'd cook it ourselves and sometimes we'd just take over a restaurant and have the restaurateur put on a big deal for us.
[00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:52.020] Now the latest incarnation of that is the Mustacholi Club, which occurs always in Santa Cruz,
[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:59.020] and it's a restaurant that's located either at Freddy Domino's house or another friend of ours' home, a guy by the name of Ralph Macheo,
[00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:02.020] who's a food broker at Packer.
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:04.020] And that's pretty much the same thing.
[00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:09.020] It's the guys, the Calamari Club and the Mustacholi Club, we're both just the guys.
[00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:13.020] It's the guys' time to do their thing, and we get together and we cook and we eat.
[00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:16.020] And it's potluck, and everybody cooks a dish.
[00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:17.020] It's a lot of fun.
[00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:19.020] Sounds like it, man.
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.020] We'll have to invite you.
[00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:21.020] We'd like to do that. We'd love to do that.
[00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:24.020] Take some pictures, meet other people.
[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:26.020] But you can't do it until I get back.
[00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:28.020] I'm going to Europe in a few days.
[00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:29.020] How long are you going to be around?
[00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.020] Until the 21st.
[00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.020] Of September.
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.020] You won't be back.
[00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:34.020] I won't be back.
[00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:35.020] You'll have to set that up with Freddy.
[00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.020] Oh, I'm going to be sorry I missed that.
[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:42.020] What about other aspects of Italian life and culture?
[00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:44.020] How about the language?
[00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:47.020] Well, it has waned off.
[00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:50.020] Our fathers were born in Italy and spoke the language.
[00:12:50.020 --> 00:13:02.020] But none of the, except for maybe the older, some of our older cousins who are now, as I mentioned earlier, in their 50s and 60s, I think some of them can speak Italian fairly well.
[00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:06.020] But the younger generation just has sort of lost that, unfortunately.
[00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:10.020] So, say, in those meetings back in the winery, those were held in English.
[00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.020] In English, yeah.
[00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:14.020] Yeah, and they'd swear in Italian.
[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:17.020] The jokes were told in Italian, yeah, and the swearing was in Italian.
[00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:19.020] But the meetings were conducted in English.
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:26.020] That is one thing that I think, you know, we really tried, I think, to maintain our cultural and very proud of our heritage.
[00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:32.020] And that's the one thing I feel personally a little bit bad about is that I can't speak the language.
[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.020] Why do you think that happened?
[00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:40.020] I mean, that's one thing I wondered about in my own family, which was similar in some ways, my family business was Jewish.
[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:47.020] But the language, you know, the older generation, although they all spoke Italian, they, you know, they didn't, you know, they didn't have the language.
[00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:48.020] They didn't speak Italian.
[00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:50.020] They didn't have the second or third generation.
[00:13:50.020 --> 00:14:05.020] Well, I think a lot of that is just due to the fact that they moved to a new, I mean, the older generation really adhered to some of their heritage in terms of, I mean, they married Italian women almost universally.
[00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:14.020] And then all of a sudden you're in this new country and you've, I guess, to make it real pure and simple, you've got access to different nationalities.
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.020] So, all of a sudden the younger generations were marrying.
[00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:17.020] My father didn't marry Italian.
[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:19.020] My father didn't marry an Italian woman.
[00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:20.020] His father did.
[00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:23.020] Now, I guess your wife's Italian.
[00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:25.020] She's Northern, but that's fine.
[00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:28.020] But a lot of our cousins, yeah, but a lot of the cousins didn't marry Italian women.
[00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:35.020] So, you kind of lost that need and obligation to pass the language on to your children, I think, because of that.
[00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:42.020] Well, but, and in my case, there was another, in my family's case, there was another element, which may have been true for your father, too.
[00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:45.020] But I can remember my mother saying that as a young child.
[00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:48.020] She was, I mean, they spoke Italian.
[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:49.020] They were looked down upon.
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.020] I mean, it was a very heavy concern.
[00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:51.020] Oh, that too, yeah.
[00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:55.020] They, my mother was raised in Morgan Hill, just up the road.
[00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:59.020] And boy, you know, that was, that was just something you didn't do.
[00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:02.020] It was the lowest, you were on the lowest rung of the ladder.
[00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:09.020] And if you spoke it, that was pretty much verifying and acknowledging your position there.
[00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:14.020] So, unfortunately, it became a product of discrimination, I think, in those early days.
[00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:17.020] Now, I think, you know, as I say, we regret it.
[00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:20.020] I encouraged my kids, my daughters to study it in school.
[00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:23.020] And one of them did, and the other one took French.
[00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:26.020] And neither one of them have shown much interest in carrying it forward.
[00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:31.020] So, I'm afraid that's something that's probably going to be lost.
[00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:34.020] What about other aspects, like sports?
[00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:37.020] Did anyone play boccia or anything like that?
[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:38.020] Yeah, our side did.
[00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.020] Oh, did they?
[00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:41.020] Yeah, on my mother's side, we played boccia.
[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:43.020] And still, I mean, I have a set at home.
[00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:44.020] I very rarely play boccia.
[00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:50.020] I don't really play, but every once in a while, we get together with a group and smoke Toscano cigars.
[00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:52.020] There is a very active event.
[00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:54.020] That's one thing you guys should do on the east side of town.
[00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:59.020] There's some boccia ball players at Forest Park, Forest Street Park.
[00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:03.020] They have a really good boccia set up over there and some really interesting characters.
[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:04.020] When do they play?
[00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:05.020] I think they play every day.
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:06.020] Really? Oh, great.
[00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:09.020] I think if you drove over there today, they'd probably be there.
[00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:13.020] It's on the east side of town, and there's probably a good story there for you.
[00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:17.020] When we started, nicknames came up as a topic.
[00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:19.020] Maybe you can talk a little bit about that.
[00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:23.020] Well, I think that probably goes back to a lot of it was religious background.
[00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:29.020] A lot of people were named John, Michael, Peter, the Catholic background.
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:38.020] And so consequently, the family had a lot of Michael Felices, John Felices, Peter Felices, whatever.
[00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:43.020] And to distinguish in conversation who you were talking about, they gravitated toward nicknames.
[00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:54.020] And some of them are Tall Ernie, Walnut Ernie, give me some help.
[00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:56.020] Little Louie, Louie Moon.
[00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:57.020] Louie Moon.
[00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:58.020] Fat Mike.
[00:16:58.020 --> 00:16:59.020] Fat Mike.
[00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:00.020] Canry Mike.
[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.020] Canry Mike.
[00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.020] Winery Mike.
[00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.020] Mary Upstairs.
[00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:10.020] I mean, there are a million of them.
[00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.020] Joe DeZuppramare, which means from over the ocean.
[00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:13.020] He came late.
[00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:14.020] And so they came.
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.020] Trucker Joe.
[00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:16.020] Trucker Joe.
[00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:17.020] Numbers Joe.
[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:18.020] I mean, the list is endless.
[00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:19.020] Well, how were some of these nicknames created?
[00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:20.020] Obviously, someone was big or small, but Walnut.
[00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:21.020] He's a Walnut Packer.
[00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:22.020] Walnut Ernie.
[00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.020] He's a Walnut Packer.
[00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:24.020] As distinguished from Tall Ernie, who's a real estate guy and happens to be really tall.
[00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:25.020] Numbers Joe is an accountant.
[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:26.020] Trucker Joe is a trucker.
[00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:27.020] What about Mary Upstairs?
[00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:28.020] Mary Upstairs was Ann Marie Liko.
[00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.020] She lived upstairs over the grocery store, to be distinguished from Mary Upstairs.
[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:30.020] And so, I think that was a big thing.
[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.020] And so, I think that was a big thing.
[00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:32.020] And so, I think that was a big thing.
[00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.020] And so, I think that was a big thing.
[00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:34.020] I don't know, some other Mary.
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:35.020] Somewhere along the line.
[00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:36.020] Did you guys have nicknames?
[00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:37.020] No.
[00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:38.020] No, none of us.
[00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:39.020] There's no other Timothy.
[00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:40.020] There's no other Timothy, I can guarantee you that.
[00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:41.020] So that was a phenomenon of your...
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.020] Yeah.
[00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:43.020] Pretty much, yeah.
[00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:44.020] He had a little nickname for a while.
[00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:45.020] Moose.
[00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.020] Moose.
[00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:47.020] Moose.
[00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:48.020] Moose.
[00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:49.020] Moose.
[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:50.020] Moose.
[00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:51.020] Moose.
[00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:52.020] Moose.
[00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:53.020] Moose.
[00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:54.020] Moose.
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:55.020] Moose.
[00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.020] Moose.
[00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:57.020] Moose.
[00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:58.020] Moose.
[00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:59.020] Moose.
[00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:00.020] Moose.
[00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:01.020] Moose.
[00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:02.020] Moose.
[00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:03.020] Moose.
[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:04.020] Moose.
[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:05.020] Moose.
[00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:06.020] Yeah, or Papa Bear.
[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.020] He used to play football.
[00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.020] Oh, yeah.
[00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:09.020] He didn't like that nickname, but...
[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:10.020] What about...
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:13.020] I mean, my imagination leaps when I hear a name like Members Joe and the whole issue
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:14.020] of the popular conception of Italians and association with the mafia and all that stuff.
[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:15.020] No.
[00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:16.020] Was that ever a factor at all?
[00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:31.020] No, and it's interesting because I worked with the Italian government and the Italian
[00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:32.020] government and the Italian government, and they were very, very, very, very, very, very
[00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:33.020] conservative.
[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:34.020] And I think that's why I feel like it's such a great thing.
[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.020] I mean, not just...
[00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:36.020] Yeah, it's interesting.
[00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:41.020] You know, today a lot of people, like my friends who maybe don't share an Italian background,
[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:48.260] will say, you know, you guys, the Italians, the heritage, you know, it must be great.
[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:55.460] Not inferring that I'm involved with the mafia, but you know, the mafia, that whole mystique,
[00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.540] the power, all of that.
[00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:59.020] And there seems to be sort of a...
[00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:00.020] Perception.
[00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:01.020] Mm-hmm.
[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:03.480] not necessarily just an assumption
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.080] but an affection for that
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.560] and that's something
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.360] that our fathers very
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.780] violently reacted to
[00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:12.480] and avoided
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.720] Numbers Joe
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:16.320] was an accountant
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.440] he had nothing to do with any crimes
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.460] I don't know
[00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:23.840] John says that
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.560] one of the reasons we were able to
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.080] avoid that is because
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.980] our family didn't stop on the east coast
[00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:31.200] on our way out
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.820] I guess that's where
[00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:34.560] it really began
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.620] needless to say there's that type of
[00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:38.840] activity out here today
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:41.040] but I think it sort of came from the east coast
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.580] I don't know whether that's true or not
[00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:44.180] but I think
[00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:46.480] the stop at Ellis Island for my dad was about
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.120] four hours and then he was
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.100] in California
[00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.980] so fortunately we've been able to stay
[00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:53.560] away from it
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.600] I really wasn't hurt
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.640] in the way I put it
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.500] I know in my family
[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.860] it's the popular idea
[00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:02.820] that if you're Italian
[00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:05.280] somehow there's some sort of mafia connection
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.880] and for most families
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:09.140] of course there isn't
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:11.860] but then as you said the mafia has this kind of
[00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:12.940] you know
[00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:15.400] romantic or mythical
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.920] there's an affection for it
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:19.360] and in a funny sort of way
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:20.820] some of that kind of plays out
[00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:23.860] and I've seen that even among Italians
[00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:24.920] my own age
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.740] even though they're not in the mafia
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:29.080] they sometimes will mimic someone
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:29.840] that's in the mafia
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.400] or talk about it
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.400] and as I say
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.660] that affection for it
[00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:39.760] but our fathers never had that
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.780] I mean they always reacted very negatively
[00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:44.000] to any suggestion
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.540] that Italians
[00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:47.500] are automatically mafioso
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.380] in fact my father
[00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:51.540] in particular
[00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.340] was very defensive
[00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:54.940] about his Italian heritage
[00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:56.420] to begin with he felt that there was
[00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:58.460] a lot of discrimination early on
[00:20:58.460 --> 00:20:58.640] and
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.640] and was very proud of the fact
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.340] that the family in particular
[00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:05.600] and Italians in general
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:06.640] had risen to
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.400] you know
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.160] for instance if he would read a story
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:09.760] a news story
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.460] about a judge who was an Italian
[00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:11.980] see that
[00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:12.800] he's a judge
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:13.420] he's Italian
[00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:14.660] make an example of it
[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:15.400] he's a senator
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.320] or a congressman
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:17.100] or something like that
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:17.380] so
[00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:19.680] and of course we never really felt that
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.760] that kind of prejudice
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:21.740] because by the time
[00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.460] we became aware that
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:23.980] you know
[00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:25.480] we were no longer the lowest
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:28.020] socioeconomic realm
[00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:29.040] on the totem pole
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:30.300] on the ladder
[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:31.180] with somebody else
[00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.800] so you know
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.140] I always used to wonder about that
[00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:36.480] but I'm sure it still exists out there
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:37.740] to some extent
[00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:41.920] we're interested in
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.360] talking to people involved
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:44.860] in agriculture
[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.420] in a very direct way
[00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:48.200] people who work on
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.380] or manage or own
[00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:51.160] some of the types of farming
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.200] that you mentioned before
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:52.880] row crops
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.080] and food and nut production
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.380] are there individuals
[00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:57.340] that you would recommend?
[00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:58.340] I think they definitely
[00:21:58.340 --> 00:21:58.880] ought to talk to
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:21:59.720] Val Felice
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:00.140] yeah
[00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:01.540] Val Felice would be a great one
[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:03.780] he's a very colorful guy
[00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:05.700] and his son Bob
[00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:08.440] and he is one of the guys
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:08.980] for instance
[00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:10.400] that had a lot to do with
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:13.160] the Garlic Festival
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.000] still makes his money
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:14.400] I think
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.480] basically in agriculture
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.480] what kinds of agricultural pursuits?
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:19.920] row crops basically
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:20.980] tomatoes and garlic
[00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:24.340] yeah tomatoes and garlic
[00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:25.380] yeah the Garlic Festival
[00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:27.260] was kind of interesting
[00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:28.060] the way that came about
[00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:28.780] in 1979
[00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:31.120] when Rudy Malone
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:32.780] who was then the president
[00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:33.680] of Gavilan College
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:34.540] decided that we wanted
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:35.540] to have a Garlic Festival
[00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:38.600] we were having trouble
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:39.280] the first year
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.180] getting garlicky foods
[00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:41.700] I mean you know
[00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:42.280] you could easily get
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:42.980] a hot dog stand
[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:43.780] a hamburger stand
[00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:44.840] but what we really wanted
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.000] was garlicky foods
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.740] and we had had a tradition
[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:50.000] as long as I can remember
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.220] that at the end of the year
[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:52.940] the harvest
[00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:55.760] we'd go over to Val's ranch
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.060] and help him put on a deal
[00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:58.080] for his employees
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:58.620] and suppliers
[00:22:58.620 --> 00:22:58.760] and suppliers
[00:22:58.780 --> 00:22:59.780] and customers
[00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:00.680] and then he'd come over
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:01.180] to our ranch
[00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:02.080] and do the same thing
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.060] and then we'd go over
[00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:04.540] to Don Christopher's ranch
[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:05.500] and then here and there
[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:10.300] so I was talking to Rudy
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.660] about the lack of food
[00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:12.940] and I said
[00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:13.840] well let me go talk to Val
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:14.320] and see maybe
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:15.460] if he would consent to
[00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:16.680] our other people here too
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:17.080] okay
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.380] okay we'll just wrap up
[00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:19.440] in a couple minutes
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.380] if he'd consent
[00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:23.580] to putting on this thing
[00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:25.000] and Val said
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:25.740] oh gee I don't know
[00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:26.180] but okay
[00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:26.940] and we got together
[00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:28.060] a bunch of farmers basically
[00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:28.620] and put on a deal
[00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:29.620] and we got to do it
[00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:30.620] and it was a great deal
[00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:31.620] and we went to the ranch
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:32.620] and we started to have
[00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:33.620] a barbecue
[00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:34.620] and we were actually
[00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:35.620] we were actually
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:36.620] on the typical barbecue
[00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:37.620] but for us
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:38.620] a barbecue wasn't a steak
[00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:39.620] it was calamari
[00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:40.620] scampi
[00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:41.620] you know
[00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:42.620] those kinds of things
[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:43.620] sort of a gourmet
[00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:44.620] type of barbecue
[00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:45.620] and you know
[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:46.620] now
[00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:47.620] Gourmet Alley
[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:48.620] which is what that became
[00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:49.620] is now
[00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:50.620] it's the largest outdoor kitchen
[00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:51.620] in the world
[00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:52.620] and serves tons of food
[00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:53.620] it's a shame
[00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:54.620] you weren't able to come
[00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:55.620] to the Garlic Festival
[00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:56.620] but it's really
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:57.620] a big, big deal
[00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:58.620] and Val is still
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:03.340] have to talk to him. What about Mr. Leco who's involved in cherry production?
[00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:08.040] Well he's involved with us in cherry production. Okay. Yeah but you might want to talk to...
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:11.180] He's not around you're not really gonna gain anything. You might want to talk to
[00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:16.200] Al Denise and Chuck Felice from Hollister who Chuck Felice in particular
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:27.620] who's a cherry grower and a packer and shipper. Who else? I don't know if Denise is Italian.
[00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:33.300] I guess he is but certainly Chuck is. Al Denice would you say? Al Denice and Chuck Felice.
[00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:48.340] Denise and Felice from Hollister. Who else? Well as I say Belle the minute you guys
[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:52.000] leave I know I should have told you. You're gonna talk to the Fortinos.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.380] What about Bertuccio? I don't know the guy. Yeah he's a
[00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:57.600] person from the L.A. I don't know if he's a part of the L.A. ... I don't know if he's a part of the L.A.
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:05.200] pretty big farmer out of Hollister. I can't think of his first name now. Paul. Yeah, Paul Bertuccio
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:13.620] might be a good one to talk to. He's in Hollister? Yeah. Bertuccio? B-E-R-T-U-C-C-I-O. Yeah, Bertuccio.
[00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:18.740] What does he grow up there? I don't even know. I think he's in garlic and
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:22.240] row crops, probably some tree crops over there, stone fruit.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:30.600] Well, I don't know. Our cousin Ernie over at Vigna Walnut Shale, he owns that business now,
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:36.980] Ernie Felice, Walnut Ernie. What's the name of his business? V-I-G-N-A. In fact,
[00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:42.280] the guy that he bought the business from might be somebody interesting to talk to, Frank Vigna.
[00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:50.080] Yeah. F-I-G-N-A. V-I-G-N-A. A retired gentleman.
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:56.480] What about the grocery business? Are you... Sure, yeah.
[00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:00.360] You know, you ought to talk to Mike Bonfondi. He's the, has Nob Hill. Right.
[00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:12.860] You know, Chester Papin, retired, but a former vineyardist and farmer.
[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:19.320] Of the local wineries, in addition to the Fortino's, who would you recommend?
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:20.540] Well, you've already talked to Guillermo.
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:29.720] Scaliotti's right out here, right off First Street, Pete Scaliotti, that family. They have a little family winery there.
[00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:31.740] That's Live Oak Winery? Live Oak Winery.
[00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:38.360] Okay, well, that's good.
[00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:45.760] And maybe we can get you guys set up at a creek and see if we can get you guys invited to a mustachioly club.
[00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:52.220] Yeah, we'd love that. And if you think of anything else, we're staying over at the Leavesley Inn.
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:27:03.080] We're interested in documenting, I mean, taking photographs and observing other types of traditional activities in addition to farming.
[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:05.440] You ought to go to the Pump House Restaurant then.
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:06.480] Yeah, where's that?
[00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:10.580] Val's Place. I'll see if I can get you an invite to that.
[00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:11.440] That would be neat.
[00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:12.260] That would be neat.
[00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:13.820] Tell me about that. What is that?
[00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:21.000] Pump House Restaurant. He's got a, his old homestead used to be in the middle of the country and now it's completely surrounded by town.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.060] You know, he's got the high school.
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:22.740] Yeah, he's got the high school.
[00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:24.500] And he's got a little bit of a fun side and condominiums and apartments.
[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:30.480] And his childhood home is currently being rented out and in the backyard is this old Pump House.
[00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:32.560] And they set it up with a kitchen.
[00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:34.120] They called it Pump House Restaurant.
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:35.420] And he really puts on a deal.
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:37.000] Funny afternoon lunch type deal.
[00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:37.460] Yeah.
[00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:39.340] In fact, we just had one, what, the week before last?
[00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:40.800] The week before last for Fred's birthday.
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.740] We celebrated Fred's birthday.
[00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:44.240] As many times as we can.
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:45.060] Yeah.
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:51.300] So, I'll give Val a call for you and see if we can get you an invite to that.
[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:52.240] That would be a lot of fun.
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:52.540] Sure.
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:54.580] And you'll meet some characters there.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:55.600] Charlie Corderoly.
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:56.060] Yeah.
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:57.760] He's an interesting guy.
[00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:00.380] He's from extreme northern Italy.
[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:04.120] And he married one of the, oh, there's a family.
[00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:04.920] There's one.
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:05.660] Mike Mondelli.
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.160] M-O-N-D-E-L-L-I.
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:10.740] He's a farmer, local farmer.
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:13.400] In Gilroy?
[00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:13.800] Yeah.
[00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:14.740] What does he grow?
[00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:16.640] I think tomatoes.
[00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:17.320] Garlic.
[00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:20.660] Boy.
[00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:22.220] What about the Avali?
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:22.340] Avali.
[00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:26.680] Well, they're tomato plants.
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:27.860] I think you should meet the Avalis.
[00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:29.100] You should definitely meet them.
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.220] Garden Valley Foods.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:31.920] Okay.
[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:34.680] You want to speak to Fred Avali.
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.720] Now, this is a real bad time.
[00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:40.440] They may not consent to talk to you because he's right in the middle of the pack right now.
[00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:42.760] But that might be interesting for you to see and take some pictures of.
[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:44.040] Yeah, if they were to let us come in and take pictures.
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:44.920] How do you spell his last name?
[00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:46.460] A-V-A-L-L-I.
[00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:49.000] Fred Avali.
[00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:51.780] Or, you know, a good one to talk to.
[00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:52.220] Maybe a little bit of a talk.
[00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:54.740] A little bit more accessible would be Louis Avali, his brother.
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.420] And he's in the same business?
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:57.840] Yeah.
[00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:02.000] And then if they let you talk to Mario Avali, bring your pads.
[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:05.040] Because he is probably one of the most interesting characters around here.
[00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:06.060] Is that the father?
[00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:08.480] No, that's the crazy brother.
[00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:10.780] They're all a little nuts.
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:11.800] They're all a little bit nuts.
[00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:13.180] How come?
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:14.920] They're just all nuts.
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:17.240] Why don't you make your own judgment?
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.960] It would be interesting to get the three of them like you got the three of us and listen to the stories.
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:21.400] Okay.
[00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:22.920] We'll make some great stories for you.
[00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:24.020] Well, this has been great.
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:25.740] I know you've got to move on to some other business.
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:28.700] Well, we appreciate the opportunity to give you guys some input.
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:29.840] So when are you leaving town?
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:32.040] I'm leaving a week from yesterday.
[00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:34.500] I'm going to the old country.
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:40.240] We'd like to bring a professional photographer back and take a picture of you three guys together, if that would be all right.
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:40.800] Sure, sure.
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:43.620] We've got a fairly full day today.
[00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:45.120] When did you want to get?
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:46.380] Pretty well booked until afternoon.
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:47.440] You're coming in tomorrow.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:47.780] Yeah.
[00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:49.720] But we'll call you out maybe tomorrow sometime.
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.160] And see what looks good.
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:56.180] On your calendar it should take 15 or 20 minutes or something like that maybe here in the office.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:57.620] Okay.
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:58.460] Great.
[00:29:58.460 --> 00:29:58.960] I'd like to.
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:29:59.460] Okay.
[00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:00.620] Let me leave my number up there.
[00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:01.460] Yeah, please do.
[00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:35.260] Don't forget my number now, I just want the time to leave your exit.
[00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:36.000] Jack?
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:36.640] Me?
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:37.480] I just want to give you something.
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:38.840] Come home tomorrow tomorrow.
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:39.680] Ram yummy to it.
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:40.240] Fuck it.
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.160] Go with me today.
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:41.840] Good house.
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:42.240] Thanks.
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:42.820] Nましょう.
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:43.700] See you tonight.
[00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:45.120] At 9 at 11.
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:45.560] Okay.
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:46.020] Take care.
[00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:46.600] Take care.
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:48.220] God bless you.
[00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:51.400] Fortunately today has been really fun here.
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:52.080] Thank you for having me.
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:31:22.060] Thank you.
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:52.060] Thank you.
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:32:22.060] Thank you.
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:52.060] Thank you.
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:33:22.060] Thank you.
