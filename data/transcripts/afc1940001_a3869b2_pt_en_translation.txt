[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000] The poor man who has his love beyond the river
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000] wants to tell him and can not, from the heart makes a ship
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000] Ai ai ai, ai ai ai, ai ai what pain
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000] I do not know who can live happy in the center of his love
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000] Ai ai ai, ai ai ai, ai ai what pain
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000] I do not know who can live happy in the center of his love
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000] I can not stop loving you, my love, I can not
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000] Where always to accompany you you leave my heart
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000] Ai ai ai, ai ai ai
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000] Ai ai ai, ai ai ai, ai ai what pain
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.000] I do not know who can live happy in the center of his love
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000] Ai ai ai, ai ai ai, ai ai what pain
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000] I do not know who can live happy in the center of his love
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000] I've had happy days but now I'm sad
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000] I never had joy again
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000] I've had joy since my father left me
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000] Ai ai ai, ai ai ai, ai ai what pain
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000] I do not know who can live happy in the center of his love
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000] Ai ai ai, ai ai ai, ai ai what pain
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000] I do not know who can live happy in the center of his love
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000] I've heard the footsteps of the sea you stopped crossing
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000] I've had the envy of waves that kiss the beach
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000] Ai ai ai, ai ai ai, ai ai what pain
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000] I do not know who can live happy in the center of his love
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000] Ai ai ai, ai ai ai, ai ai what pain
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000] I don't know who could live without your love.
