[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000] The American Pronunciation Guide Presents ''How to Pronounce Ladies''
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000] for the group, the folk group.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000] All right, and who are those ladies?
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000] Those ladies, they are just housewives.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000] But is this in the Azores?
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000] No, this is here, in the Holy Ghost Park here in Lowell.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000] We have here, like you just mentioned,
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000] Mr. Mateus Martins, this is her mother, his mother,
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000] and this is her aunt.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000] This is another, Sra. Luisa Espinola, here.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000] She's a lady that used to help me on those things.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000] Those old ladies, they are really experts,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000] because over there in the old country, in the Azores,
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000] they do this type of food, this is a type of food
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000] that is made in the Azores.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000] It's a type of food that you do really just in special occasions,
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000] like for Holy Ghost occasions, in weddings, big festivities,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000] they do this type of food.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000] It's more or less like New England boiled dinner,
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000] except they use all the juice they take from the soup,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000] they put on the top of special bread, homemade bread,
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000] and they make a special bread soup with it.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000] And of course, takes everything,
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000] since our chorizo, our linguiça,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000] sometimes even morsel, and bacon, meat, pork,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000] everything goes inside.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000] Cabbages, and potatoes, and they make and they serve it,
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000] as you can see here.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000] After this is served, they are preparing the dishes.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000] This is another type of thing that I'll go over that.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000] Could you see all the bread here, all over the place?
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000] And this is, they are preparing those soups.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000] And that's the bread floating in the soup?
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000] That's right.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000] It is not really floating in the soup,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000] that's almost dry,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000] because after they put over here on the bread,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000] they let it suck into the bread,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000] and they tap it off with some clothes,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000] so the thing, like the steam goes inside of the bread,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000] and the bread is almost dry, steamy,
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000] if you know what I mean by that.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000] Steamy, but dry.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000] And as you can see, here they are taking to serve,
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000] and they start serving, here it is.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000] See?
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000] One of the girls and boys of the group,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000] they are serving over here.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000] This time we had the Portuguese consulate,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000] then Dr. Avila, he was here, our priest, Father Eusebio,
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000] some representatives of things around here,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000] and we had, as you can see, we had like a U-shaped table
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000] to accommodate everybody that was here.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000] Then, a lady that I respect very much,
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000] Senhora Julinda Melva, she was with the Instituto de Vida,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000] Oh, yes.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000] Instituto Internacional of Law.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000] She happens to be here because she's really,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000] she was really something in the Portuguese,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000] still is something in the Portuguese community.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000] And after that, we danced, we played,
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000] and we, as you can see, we present our group Folkloric Dancing,
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000] and several numbers that we had,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000] that is starting over here with the musical,
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000] the people who play the music,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000] as you can see, there is a Portuguese guitar here,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000] that's a very Portuguese instrument here,
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000] a bandolim and two guitars.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000] And we have people serving,
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000] we have our folk group in action here,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000] really on the Holy Ghost.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000] Then used to have 12 pairs,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000] so it would be 24, 12 boys and 12 girls
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000] going on on this thing.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000] We had a special band,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000] Portuguese band playing for us.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000] And we used to do this in every single anniversary
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000] of the group Folkloric,
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000] the folk group that we have for seven years here in Lowell.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000] After, was all, start dispersing himself,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000] but even though we went to Canada one time representing us,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000] representing Lowell,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000] we went several times,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000] we went several times in some contests in New Bedford,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000] as well as in Cambridge and Peabody,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000] which we have some trophies over here.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000] From there we get the second prize over there
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000] on the 10th of June, 1985.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000] In 1985 we will get the second prize
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000] as the best group in action on the streets.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000] It's a parade that we have on the 10th of June.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000] Our 10th of June is something like your 4th of July.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000] Our 10th of June is the day of Portugal's 10th of June.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000] Oh, is it?
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000] Yes, like here is 4th of July.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000] It's Camões, our poet.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000] Camões will be like the Portuguese Shakespeare,
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000] let's put it that way.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000] Is it his birthday?
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000] Yes, it is, of his death.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000] So the day of his death was the 10th of June.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000] 10th of June, 1580.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000] That's when he died,
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000] and that's the day of Portugal
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000] and the Portuguese communities all over the world.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000] And then we had the big parade,
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000] usually in Cambridge,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000] because it's put up by the Portuguese Consulate
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000] in the area of Boston.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000] But because all the Portuguese in the area of Boston
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000] are concentrated in Somerville and Cambridge,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000] it is there that we do that every year.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000] So in 1985 we went there and we got that second prize
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000] because what we do, we go on parade,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000] but we keep dancing on the streets.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000] We are not just showing off, dancing and going and dancing
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000] and keep going, dancing and singing.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000] And that's what we did.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000] Here we made part of several regattas
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000] when they had it on Pawtucket Boulevard,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000] as you can see by the pictures here.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000] These are taken on Pawtucket Boulevard?
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000] No, they were taken before we took over.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000] They were taken in our St. Anthony Church grounds,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000] on the back of the parking lot, as a matter of fact.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000] That's where we put the city of Lourdes,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000] gave us this big truck,
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000] and we decorate with something very, very, very,
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000] with something very Azorean,
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000] so flowers, they are Azorean,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000] and the windmill,
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000] because the windmill is really a symbol of Portugal.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000] We still have it in use, as you can see over there,
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000] in that prospect you see over there,
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000] the windmill over there?
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000] Yes.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000] It's a symbol of the Azores, really.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000] The Azores?
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000] Not really Portugal, I'll say the Azores.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000] The Azores, we use a lot of windmills.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000] Now they don't use it no more,
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000] but they still have a lot of them there,
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000] and they keep it in shape for folk purposes
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000] and to show the tourists and so forth.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000] And we have several things showing that we are Portuguese.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000] And over there, when we were,
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000] because we had so much space in this trailer,
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000] we were dancing along, singing, dancing,
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000] and jumping and doing our thing.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000] So, as you can see, there is the windmill,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000] a replica, really, of the windmill over here.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000] And there we are in action,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000] going down somewhere in downtown.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000] This is downtown.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000] It's almost in City Hall, as you can see,
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000] in Neuemach Street.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000] Yes, and our folk group,
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000] we started this folk group in 19...
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000] Let me see, 1979, 1980.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000] In 1980, we started our folk group.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000] A couple of girls approached me,
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000] young girls, as a matter of fact.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000] They were 15 years old then,
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000] and a 15 and 13-year-old girl,
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000] she came to me with this Fatima Silva
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000] and another girl here,
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000] Guadalupe Espinola.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000] This girl, they came to me,
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000] asking me for help.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000] They would like to put a folk group together.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000] Just because I've been all my life involved
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000] with theater and the folk things, yes.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000] In Portugal, I used to sing with a band and so forth.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000] It's something in the family.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000] I have a background on that.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000] They thought about me.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000] They came to me.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000] So I didn't know much about the folk.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000] I knew the folk, our folk,
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000] Portuguese folk very much, so,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000] but I was never, I was never coached much.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000] So I sing for music from Portugal
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000] and I start to, you know, to taking some,
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000] talking with people to do this,
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000] this type of dance,
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000] because there is some special steps
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000] for each type of music,
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000] for each type of song.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000] And we put the girls and boys together
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000] and I did my best.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000] And we were very successful, as I said.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000] We went to one time to Canada,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000] Toronto, and we were,
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000] Montreal, I'm sorry, to Montreal.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000] And we were very successful there.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000] People liked us.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000] We worked strictly with the islander folk.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000] By islander, I mean the Azores and Madeira.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000] Because there is a difference
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000] between the Portuguese folk,
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000] the one we practice,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000] they practice in continent,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000] on the mainland,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000] and the one we do in the Azores.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000] Is there a difference
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000] between the Azores and Madeira?
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000] Exactly, as well, as well, as well.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000] Our, the folk of Madeira,
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000] it's very gay, let's put it that way.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000] It's very happy.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000] Songs and everything, happy songs.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000] Continent, the mainland,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000] depends on the location where they are.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000] But mostly they are happy songs as well,
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000] the folk by itself.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000] When you go to the Azores,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000] something very different happens.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000] The folk start being a little sad.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000] There is a why, there is a why, why.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000] The folk is very sad and smooth,
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000] and not a jumpy and gay
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000] that would be in Madeira and continent.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000] Because the islands, they are islands,
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000] surrounded by sea,
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000] the people, they don't have,
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000] they are surrounded by the horizons,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000] they can't go away sometimes,
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000] they wish to, they can't.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000] And there is a lot of emigration,
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000] from the Azores, always have been,
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000] since the 16th century,
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000] that's as we can remember,
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000] because the Azores,
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000] they were habitating in the 15th century.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000] So they start emigrating,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000] they start 100 years after to whatever,
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000] Hawaii, wherever they found places to go,
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000] they went to.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000] And the folk is always the sweetheart
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000] that they had left and never came back.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000] And it's about, always about Boa,
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000] about boats and sea,
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000] and fishermen and fishing.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000] Of course, fishing is a dangerous life,
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000] sometimes they go to fish and they never return back.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000] So you can see why there is always,
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000] there is some songs,
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000] like one, Saudade.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000] Saudade, it's like homesick, being homesick.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000] The word Saudade means I miss, I miss you.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000] If I say to you, I have Saudade from you,
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000] means I miss, I'm missing you.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000] It's a word Saudade, that means that.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000] And there is a song called Saudade,
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000] the other one would be My Sweetheart,
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000] and they would say,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000] Oh, my sweetheart, if you go as you say you are,
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000] please send me a letter once in a while,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000] because I'm here still on the docks waiting for your return.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000] So it's always songs like that.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000] So the folk, the Azorean folk,
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000] it's being very smooth, very quiet.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000] It's not as gay as the other.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000] And I try to speed up the melody,
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000] and as well as the steps,
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000] to give it some, something, you know.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000] Because otherwise people would sleep and say,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000] Oh, what is this?
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000] And I was very useful on that.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000] We tried to speed up a little bit,
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000] and make it a little more gay,
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000] with steps and movements, and trying to.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000] And we did it, we did it.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000] It's very hard to work with,
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000] in our days, with the Azorean folk,
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000] as I said, because of that.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000] All of the songs that I can remember,
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000] they are really smooth.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000] They are not happy.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000] They are not like they have Malhão on,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000] on, on, on, on,
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000] mainland.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000] Oh, Malhão, Malhão,
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000] pom, pom, pom, pom, pom.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000] You should find the beat.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000] You go to Madeira, they have
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000] Deixa passar esta linda brincadeira,
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000] so, they're not a beat.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000] You go to the Azores, you got nothing like that.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000] Everything is smooth.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000] Oh, meu bem, se tu te fores,
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000] como dizem que te vais,
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000] so, it's really, see,
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000] because you see, it's really,
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000] that's the song I'm repeating again.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000] Oh, my love, if you go as you say you are,
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000] leave your name on one of the arbor stones,
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000] so I can see it once in a while,
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000] when I'm, I'm saudade,
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000] when I miss you, you know,
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000] when I miss you.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000] So, it's really hard.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000] But the folk here in Lowell,
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000] they were very,
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000] so that's too bad that it stopped.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000] Why did we stop with that?
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000] Oh, two years ago,
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000] we went to the Azores with the folk group.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000] Last year, I'm sorry, in 19,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000] in 19,
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000] in 86,
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000] we went to the Azores.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000] Then we had just girls.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000] We couldn't get no boys.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000] Oh.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000] Boys here,
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000] they start working in the Portuguese community,
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000] they buy a car,
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000] and they don't care more for dancing.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000] They start showing off their car.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000] So, as the girls started growing up
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000] and becoming 18s and 20s,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000] they were more accommodate.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000] But the boys,
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000] they, we start having failing boys,
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000] and we, when we had the reals,
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000] we had just girls and no boys.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000] So, one time I say,
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000] hey, there's nothing we can do.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000] Let's do with girls.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000] So, the last times we did with girls.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000] We did with girls,
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000] and we were successful with just with the girls.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000] When we took the,
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000] the, the folk group to Graciosa,
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000] which was one of the islands of the Azores
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000] this last July,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000] July 1986,
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000] we were very successful there.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000] Everybody liked it.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000] We took our songs,
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000] we took our players,
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000] and everything was very nice.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000] And,
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000] and,
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000] and,
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000] and,
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000] and it,
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000] it helped us.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000] It is,
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000] it is very nice,
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000] it is very nice to do this way even,
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000] you know what I'm talking about?
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000] Forget it.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000] And,
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000] and,
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000] and we also started keep gettingー
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000] going the songs because
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000] I really like them.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000] Music and ever withع
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000] and,
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000] and,
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000] and Neden was like aто be
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000] a restaurant .
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000] It was yeah.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000] Also...
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000] You know lo aEuropean music cute
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000] a everyone was,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000] wasä
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000] in.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000] Yeah.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000] obligatory
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000] because you know
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.560] Yes, nobody wants to take care of that, and that was the end of it.
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:50.820] Even if we are together, and I'm quite sure if there is a special event, we have to go.
[00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:55.420] Probably I can make a couple of calls and put a group together in a couple of months
[00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:57.980] or so, because I know where they are.
[00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:58.980] Because now it's easy.
[00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:02.620] Don't forget, I started with boys, they were Americanized, they were Americans, they didn't
[00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:05.840] even know how to dance.
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.780] They had no rhythm, they had nothing.
[00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:12.460] I started almost putting my hands on their feet and saying, you do this.
[00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:15.700] It was a lot of fun.
[00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:16.700] I loved it.
[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:23.900] Does anybody do any of the dances just for social events?
[00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:28.920] Are there dances to folk music that go on socially here?
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:30.480] Sometimes they used to have that.
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.820] It's like anything else.
[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:34.500] It's too bad, those things, they go away.
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.020] I still remember about...
[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:37.540] What?
[00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:37.780] What?
[00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:44.860] Three, four years ago when we had some dances, they used to intercalate, so putting in between
[00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:51.400] some folk dances, some old folks would get up, you know, those old folks would get up,
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:57.340] Portuguese old folk would get up, get up and go in the middle of the saloon, the hall,
[00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:00.420] and we'll dance some old folk music.
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:06.780] Of course, maybe because of the new generation now, they take over on that and they don't
[00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:07.540] care much about the folk.
[00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.940] But I know some...
[00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:10.940] This happens in Lua.
[00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:15.780] I know some places like really Lawrence, yes, Lawrence on the other side.
[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:22.860] Lawrence, they very seldom, when they have some dancing parties, they dance the chamarrita,
[00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:27.880] which is one of the few gay music that we have, chamarrita.
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:28.880] And they do that.
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:29.880] They do that.
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.080] Once you know what it is, the chamarrita.
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.540] But from that on, I don't think so.
[00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:35.540] But some still in Lawrence know.
[00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:36.540] They do.
[00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:37.540] They do.
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:38.540] But not particularly here.
[00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:39.540] Not particularly here.
[00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:42.540] In Lawrence, they do that, a lot of them.
[00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:43.540] The chamarrita.
[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:44.540] Chamarrita.
[00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:45.540] Chamarrita.
[00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:46.540] Is an Azorean dance?
[00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:48.040] It's an Azorean dance.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:51.540] It's one of the few, I would say, it's one of the few...
[00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:54.540] We can stop then.
[00:16:54.540 --> 00:17:00.540] Let me ask you just a little bit about yourself.
[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:03.420] You come from the Azores?
[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:05.460] I came from the Azores, yes.
[00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:06.940] I came from the Azores in September 1916.
[00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:07.940] I came from the Azores in September 1970.
[00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:12.940] From the island, the Azores, as you know, they are nine islands.
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:16.020] And I came from this, I was born in Fayal.
[00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:20.780] And after from Fayal, I went to Toursera, which is my father's island.
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:23.480] My mother is from Fayal.
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.040] As you can see, nine islands, people that travel in between the islands.
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.060] They used to then with boats.
[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:30.060] Now they do it with planes.
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:33.940] There is connection between all the islands, except one, Corvo.
[00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:34.940] That's the smallest one.
[00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:35.940] It's just 250 inhabitants.
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:38.380] One, the smallest one.
[00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:42.060] So anyhow, I came to...
[00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:43.720] After I married in...
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.120] My wife happens to be from Fayal also, as I.
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.120] And we met in Toursera.
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:51.200] I never knew her, originally on the islands in Port Bourbon.
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.700] So we went to Toursera.
[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:59.560] I came in 1970 to America.
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:00.760] I came because...
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:03.440] Why did I came to America?
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.940] In 1958, if I'm not wrong...
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:05.940] I was in the United States.
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:10.000] When I was young, there was eruption in the volcano in Kaplinge, which I have some literature
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000] in English over here.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.200] I'm very pleased to give it to you after.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.420] You can take it if you want to really go over what I said.
[00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:27.380] And because we were born in Fayal, we were within a special quota to come to America
[00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:33.540] because the immigration, John F. Kennedy then opened the doors for special immigrants from
[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:34.540] the volcano.
[00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:35.540] Because of the volcano.
[00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:36.140] So we went to America.
[00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.140] We had a lot of people, houses and then.
[00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:41.780] My oldest brother, we had to live in Fayal.
[00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:43.360] My oldest brother was still in Fayal.
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:52.260] So he was one of the people that lost the house and everything through the volcano.
[00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.680] So we came to America in 1960.
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.840] He became an American citizen, so it's easy.
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.600] After that, we just followed five brothers.
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.160] We were five brothers.
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.540] So the oldest one, he's in Hartford, Connecticut and he's still there.
[00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:03.540] And he's in the United States.
[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:04.540] He's in the United States.
[00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:05.540] He's in the United States.
[00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:07.520] And all the others follow him.
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:14.660] I was the third one to come over and I went to Hartford, Connecticut, near of my brother.
[00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:15.660] From Hartford, Connecticut.
[00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:19.860] But my brother was the only one there in Hartford, Connecticut, my oldest brother.
[00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:24.220] The other three, they were in this area, in Lowell.
[00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:29.080] Things were not so good for me over there and this brother of mine offered me a partnership
[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.940] with them and I came over here.
[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:35.540] And I realized myself and I figured out that I am going to realize myself here.
[00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:39.880] Because in Hartford, Connecticut, I was in between people from the mainland, nice Portuguese
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:40.880] people.
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:44.220] But they were established and everything was.
[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:50.480] So I thought being in between the people that I know, people that knew me, I could realize
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.480] myself.
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.480] And that happened really.
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:56.060] I came up here in 1976.
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:20:01.660] I worked with a brother of mine in that partnership who was a furniture store.
[00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:03.540] Wyman's used to be in Middlesex Street.
[00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:04.540] This was a furniture.
[00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:05.540] And I worked with him.
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:10.600] After the business was no good, we split from my brother.
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.180] And I got involved looking around and saying, hey, what can I do?
[00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:15.160] What can I do for the Portuguese community?
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.220] What they don't have.
[00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:23.320] They didn't have really, then they didn't have a real estate person talking fluent Portuguese.
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:27.860] There was a couple of gentlemen over there talking really broken Portuguese.
[00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:31.640] So I became a real estate broker.
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:35.480] I looked around and I said, hey, they need an insurance broker.
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.700] I became an insurance broker because they didn't have one.
[00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:43.540] And after there was not really, there was not really a Portuguese travel agency.
[00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:48.700] There was a man who was like a, who was outside salesman, sort of it.
[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.360] So I put a travel agency also.
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:55.360] And as you can see, I've been a little useful in life.
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:02.520] And I did, I made what I have in eight years.
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.480] When I split from my brother eight years ago.
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.480] Yeah.
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:10.660] I had no time to be sitting over here with you because even my mom would be my, all my
[00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:13.660] debts and my second mortgage and everything.
[00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:17.060] But in eight years I was really lucky enough.
[00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:20.100] I bought this building already.
[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:26.980] Together with this, the man has got the, the Smith, Jewelsmith, Goldsmith, Goldsmith on
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:27.980] the other side.
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:31.200] She has a jewelry store.
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.560] Actually I have, I brought kids.
[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.480] I brought two kids from Portugal.
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.660] My daughter Susana, she's 24.
[00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:40.460] My son is 21, Nuno.
[00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:43.720] And 13 years after I have two Americans, two Yankees.
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:48.480] Kevin is eight and Lolita is six.
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:49.480] Yeah.
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.660] And I'm a grandfather already.
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.160] I'm very happy as you can see.
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.160] Yes.
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.160] It's a wonderful.
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.160] I'm so proud of my family.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.160] Yes.
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.160] I got to include in my future daughter-in-law.
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.480] I got to, I got to, as a matter of fact, I got all the moments of that.
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.480] She was here.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.480] She was here.
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:02.480] She was here.
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:03.480] She was here.
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:04.480] She was here.
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:05.480] She was here.
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:06.480] She was here.
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.480] She was here.
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.480] She was here.
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:09.480] She was here.
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.480] She was here.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.480] She was here.
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.480] It was all that she was.
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.480] She was the one who put the thing and gave it to me for Christmas.
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:14.480] Kelly, my future.
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:15.480] See, I'm very proud of my heritage.
[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:16.480] I, when I say realizing myself, I am realized here.
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.660] I don't know if you know what I mean by realizing myself.
[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.140] I realize it's a word I like to use it's very much.
[00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:29.040] It's I realize myself because I am making money and at the same time I'm helping these people.
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.040] Like this man right now.
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:32.500] He asked me for, for, if he could do something.
[00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.480] I tell him, no, you can't do it.
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.740] according with the Portuguese law you have to wait another two months to do
[00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:43.660] that I know a little bit of the Portuguese law with this whatever is
[00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:47.620] involved with law what is it you go with papers immigration and so forth and the
[00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:53.200] Portuguese law according with the immigrant so I I know that I have to
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:59.380] know in this type of business and I just I help the people as much as I know
[00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:03.100] because people sometimes they want to send like this man he was asking me for
[00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:06.860] a paper to send to Portugal and I told him a that paper is going to cost you
[00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:10.720] $25 and there's no good you gotta wait two months in order because the rights
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:14.980] you are looking for you are just entitled for after six months in this
[00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:17.880] country just arrived four months ago because I know him you know it's another
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:23.740] thing if I didn't know him I was going to to make him spend $25 for nothing and
[00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:29.140] I know he was my client I knew he came four months ago I know everybody the
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:33.040] people came to me here just don't to us they just don't came for trip
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:33.080] you know I know everybody the people came to me here just don't to us they just don't came for trip
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:37.320] sorry sure sometimes they can tour advice they came for us to use the phone
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:42.980] and dispute the bill on the electric company or gas company and we do that
[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:48.260] free for them of course we don't charge a dime for that I'm not only public I
[00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:54.980] never charge a dime for if I execute the paper yes if I just use my seal for three
[00:23:54.980 --> 00:24:03.020] to not arise anything I don't charge a dime it's a free service that's why I
[00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:07.640] I call it seeding I put the seeds in the field and after when the right time
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:14.020] comes I get the crop after that that's my type I don't want to be rich I want
[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:22.160] to be comfortable rich richness is going to be problems I don't know looking
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:32.960] forward for it very very very very problem my heritage I I love I love the
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:37.140] Portuguese community here because they are really a plus there is some
[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:42.000] exceptions of course like I don't say that everybody is going on the right way
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.300] there is some some people that but happens without any community but in a
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:52.400] big percentage we are very quiet it's too bad it's we don't have we don't make
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:58.020] noise because we nobody knows us on the city hall you know very nice yeah that
[00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:01.260] recognizes as nice people but you know what I'm taking make noise about the
[00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:02.900] vote you know they should
[00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:07.520] go to the city hall and vote and you know we don't do that it is too bad we
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:13.560] don't have a representative in City Hall City Hall or in a high job on the city
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:19.460] that we could we need a voice let's put it that way we need a voice and we don't
[00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:27.200] have that we should have that voice I try to three four years ago I tried to
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:32.840] get people to vote I used to call them on the phone together with the
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:36.220] everyone we'd filled out with the people because our voice wasn't no noise
[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:39.340] and everything was related to what we were doing we couldn'tativo have
[00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:43.320] friends we didn't know to do but of course we thought we had to find some
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:46.980] great people and the good things for us together we didn't know who they were
[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:58.280] and and of course we didn't know it was during their decision about.
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.260] We werepeop fried.
[00:25:59.260 --> 00:25:59.400] We even know South by way of speaking body
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.520] the first time 40 years ago we for after so many years can't deal to see the hall
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:02.380] and we worked together I work together with them and that and you that on the phone I got to the house of stuff somebody ahí opposto
[00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:03.380] I think as well as I.
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:05.560] You have any more questions?
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:08.000] Why don't people want to vote?
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.800] Well, people do whatever they are used to do.
[00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:18.120] In Portugal, the immigrants over here,
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:22.360] they are here, they are after 1974.
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:25.680] In 1974, it's what it was that revolution
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:27.980] and Portugal became different.
[00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:32.680] We have a dictatorship before up to 1974.
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:34.280] And the vote, nobody would care to vote.
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.320] Vote for what?
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.780] They have the same people there.
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:37.620] Yes.
[00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:38.460] Right?
[00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:39.280] Yes, I see.
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.540] And they grew up in this idea.
[00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:45.200] I don't have to vote because I'm losing my time.
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.160] I'm going to have the same guy, whatever they want.
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.300] It's like a dynasty.
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:57.340] So it's hard now to teach the people they are wrong.
[00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:57.980] That's not the way.
[00:26:57.980 --> 00:26:59.020] It's supposed to be.
[00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:01.060] It's very hard to tell them, hey, listen,
[00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:02.020] there is more than that.
[00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:03.620] The vote is very important.
[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:04.840] We are we.
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:07.840] If we have, when I say we, I'm saying about me
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:10.460] and some leaders of the community.
[00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:11.700] Let's put it that way.
[00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:13.540] I don't want to be called a leader.
[00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:17.260] But because of my position here and the people came to me,
[00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:19.160] I feel that I am somebody in the community.
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.000] And wherever I can help, I will help you.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.780] And there's more people like that.
[00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:23.780] And we think the same way.
[00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:26.680] As a matter of fact, we were together with the priest,
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:27.380] Father .
[00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:29.260] We were together in a meeting the other day.
[00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:30.800] And this was the main point.
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.840] A group of Portuguese, we were getting together.
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:36.340] This was we trying to create an organization or a person that
[00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:38.920] will be the voice of the Portuguese community.
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:42.500] As a matter of fact, it's a little bit premature.
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:43.520] But we have.
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.080] We are working on it.
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:50.000] We are working on that, to have somebody that's being our voice.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.940] Organization, anybody that tells you that's what we want.
[00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:54.540] And we are entitled to it.
[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:56.720] Because the people, they don't know what they are entitled to.
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:57.220] Ah.
[00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:00.160] They came with the taxes and they pay the taxes.
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:03.140] They tell, they don't fix the sidewalks.
[00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:03.920] Hey.
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:07.280] They just are careful when they walk out on the streets.
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.720] And they don't know what they are entitled to.
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:13.920] And sometimes they are asking more for more
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.820] than what they are entitled to.
[00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:18.280] Because they don't know the rights.
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:19.400] You know.
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:20.860] There is a scale for everything.
[00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:21.940] And they don't know the scale.
[00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:22.440] Yes.
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:23.760] It's very hard.
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:24.980] It's very hard.
[00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:26.720] And some people over here, they are even illiterate.
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.420] Nice people on the Miron.
[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:31.380] The best people in the world.
[00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:36.240] People that don't have to sign a paper in order to pay their bills.
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:39.960] People that don't have to sign a paper in order to accomplish a contract.
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:41.280] A shake hands is enough.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:44.540] I know a lot of people over here, they don't make any contract with them.
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:45.660] They are shaking hands with them.
[00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:47.420] I say, this is a deal.
[00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:48.420] The deal is done.
[00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:49.420] Shake hands.
[00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:50.420] That's it.
[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:51.420] I know they will never pick up me.
[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:52.720] And this is among the Portuguese people.
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:53.720] Yes.
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:54.720] Yes.
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.060] I'm talking about the Portuguese people around here.
[00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:57.640] The people that I know.
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:03.040] Those so-called 16,000 Portuguese people they claim that's here.
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:04.040] Here in suburbs.
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:05.820] I'm talking about Drake and Chelmsford.
[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:06.820] So .
[00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:09.760] They are really something.
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:12.300] But as I said, they are very quiet.
[00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:13.300] They should make some noise.
[00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:14.300] They don't do it.
[00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:15.960] That's what I said for noise.
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:16.960] I'm talking about.
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:17.960] Yes.
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:18.960] There's no squeak.
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:19.960] You know.
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:21.760] And the wheel that doesn't squeak, squeak gets no grease.
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:22.760] Yes.
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:23.760] Yes.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:24.760] That's it.
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:25.760] Yes.
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:26.460] Yes.
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:27.460] Yes.
[00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:32.260] I guess the last question I'm interested in is people I've interviewed who are old timers
[00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:38.000] who have been here since the 20s or 30s tell me that this isn't a very Portuguese neighborhood
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000] anymore.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.940] And yet for me as an outsider, it appears to be.
[00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:42.940] It is.
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:43.940] It is.
[00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:44.940] It is.
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:49.320] Maybe that is not what they used to have as a Portuguese neighborhood.
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:52.940] And they have the right to think that.
[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:54.640] Those people they did beautifully.
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:59.200] They came over here in bad times.
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:02.680] They came over here 30, 40 years ago when it was tough.
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:03.980] The living was tough here.
[00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:04.980] You know that.
[00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:05.980] Yes.
[00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:06.980] There is no conditions in work.
[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:07.980] There was no protection.
[00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:08.980] There was nothing for the people.
[00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:10.980] So they had to work very hard.
[00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:17.060] And now when they see those new immigrants, Portuguese immigrants coming over using a
[00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:20.560] tie, it's a new generation of people they are.
[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:21.560] They have some school.
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:23.820] They have some high school like me and a lot of them.
[00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:29.760] And they come over here and they see us making up like I made in seven years here.
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:33.660] You know, somehow I'm not criticizing them.
[00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:35.460] It's a very natural feeling.
[00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:39.940] They feel this is completely different because they tell us, ah, my time was not like.
[00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:46.260] So whatever, even they criticize the new, but they criticize in a way of, I don't know
[00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:50.620] to tell you because everything was harder for them then and not now.
[00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:52.400] So they think in a different way.
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.340] But my feeling.
[00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:55.580] And this is very Portuguese neighborhood.
[00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:56.580] Yes.
[00:30:56.580 --> 00:31:00.580] There is some integration here, different ethnic groups like the Asians.
[00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:01.580] They are having it.
[00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:04.060] But there's people, they are nice people also.
[00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:05.480] Very nice people.
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:10.640] And I think the Portuguese, they did fantastically.
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:20.180] When I came over to Lowell about was 10, 10, 12 years ago, I can recall Concord Street
[00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:21.180] was a dump over there.
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:23.180] And the Portuguese, they start buying the houses.
[00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:26.420] One by one over there, they can see Concord Street now.
[00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:28.680] Nice and clean, pleasant street as well.
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:33.620] And a lot of neighborhood that was not for the Portuguese community because they start
[00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:38.060] competing each other which one will put the best color on the house and the best paint
[00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:39.820] and we show off the house.
