[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000] Yes. I was raised in the house with him, Mr. Felix MacMillan.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000] And they taught me mighty good. They teach me good.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000] They said, I remember, says, Joe, I said, yes sir, when we are dead and in heaven,
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000] they said, we want to raise you as an intelligent nigger.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000] We want you to have good friends like we've got.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000] Say you'll never be scratched by good, rich, sensible white folks
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000] because they can tell who you are by your raising and your compliments.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000] To show that you've been raised, he said, not by the color, but by the white.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000] I washed in iron. Some days I'd wash a hundred pieces.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000] Some, every morning, I'd have five beers to mix up, five fires to mix,
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000] and the children to dress, and churning to do.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000] And after that, but then I'd have some parts of the day.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000] But I had all that to do every day.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000] Raised right up in the house.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000] You know, I'm saying,
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000] I remember telling them one story.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000] You know, I slept like in this room and here,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000] and they slept, Joe, in the rooms to me, you know.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000] Said, Joe, if you get cold, come in our room.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000] I said, great, great, great, great, great.
