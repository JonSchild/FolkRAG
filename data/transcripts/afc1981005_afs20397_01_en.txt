[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.020] Now, I need to get this right.
[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.720] Your maiden name was Wardell?
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.720] Wicks.
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.720] Wicks.
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.720] And what was your father's name?
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.220] John Jewel Wicks.
[00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.600] John Jewel Wicks.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.600] Where was he born?
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.240] He was born in Iowa.
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.360] He was born in Iowa.
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.600] My mother was an Evans, and she was born in Minnesota.
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.480] What was her first name?
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.480] Florence.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.480] Flossie.
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.480] Flossie?
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.480] Flossie Bell.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.480] Flossie Bell.
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.220] They called her here in Montana, Florence, because they said Flossie was a nickname,
[00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.840] but her name was Flossie Bell.
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.040] How did he happen to go to Oregon?
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.580] His folks moved there in about 19—I think probably about 1910.
[00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.580] I see.
[00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.580] When was he born?
[00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.580] Do you remember?
[00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.580] 1884.
[00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.580] And she was born?
[00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.580] 1892.
[00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.580] You've got it right there.
[00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.580] They went to Oregon, met in Oregon, and were married in 1912, and came to Montana
[00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.580] in 1913.
[00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.580] What about your husband's family?
[00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.580] Had he lived in this area?
[00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.580] Yes, folks were from Iowa, and they homesteaded here on this place, and they
[00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.580] lived here.
[00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.580] And they lived here.
[00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.580] And they lived here.
[00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:23.580] And they lived here.
[00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.580] And they lived here.
[00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.580] And they lived here.
[00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.580] And they lived here.
[00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.580] And they lived here.
[00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.580] And they lived here.
[00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.580] And they lived here.
[00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.580] And they lived here.
[00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.580] And they lived here.
[00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.580] And they lived here.
[00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.580] And they lived here.
[00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.580] And they lived here.
[00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.580] Yeah.
[00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.580] They lived here.
[00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.580] They lived here.
[00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.580] Yeah.
[00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.580] What about your husband?
[00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.580] He was born in 1913, and he came here as a boy of 13.
[00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.580] So he had been born in 1900, and—
[00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.580] In Northwood, Iowa—er—close to Northwood, Iowa.
[00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.580] Northwood, Iowa.
[00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.580] Wow.
[00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.740] Did he ever—Did his parents ever say why they moved here?
[00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.760] Cause he didn't like Iowa.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.860] He didn't like Iowa?
[00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.340] Not as a boy of 13, and he didn't like it as a grown man.
[00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.580] What was it that he didn't care much for?
[00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.580] He didn't like crowded places.
[00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.580] Iowa was crowded.
[00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.080] And at that time Iowa was quite crowded. The places were, well I suppose Northwood
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.080] was a little town of about six, seven hundred. And there were little towns all the way around
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.580] them, eight, nine miles from them, just like they are along the High Line. So when he heard
[00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.580] of the land in Montana, he thought that would be a good place to come. And he came to Montana.
[00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.580] Did he like it up here?
[00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.580] I guess so. He went back to Iowa several times and always came back. I was told once
[00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.580] it was because of me that he stayed in Montana. So I asked him and he said, nope. He said,
[00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.580] I left there when I was thirteen years old because I didn't like it. And I still don't.
[00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.580] So we went back a couple times just on visits after we were married in 1936, but we never
[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.580] stayed back.
[00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.580] What about Oregon? Have you ever wished that you'd move back to Oregon?
[00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.580] No way. I don't know what, I never liked too much Oregon.
[00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.580] It was raining. When I was a little kid, it seemed like it rained all the time. Every
[00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.580] time we'd go back on a trip. And my dad, when it rained in Montana, that was a good
[00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.580] time to rest. In Oregon, it was a good time to get going. I didn't think that was a very
[00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.580] good idea to stay home when it was wet. The rest of the kids all could go, but we'd stay
[00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.580] home so Dad could rest. But Dad worked in the woods in Oregon. And that was hard work.
[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.580] Sure. That's right. What type of lumberjack was he? Was he a lumberjack?
[00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.580] No.
[00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.580] Was he one of the men that actually chopped the tree? Was he a topper?
[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:39.580] I think Dad worked in their mill more than he did out in the woods. But in 1923 and 1924,
[00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:47.580] he was one of the men that went out and helped saw the trees down. And in those days, lumbering
[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:55.580] wasn't very good. Prices were low. And that was the year that Mom was going to come home
[00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:01.580] and loan. And Dad was going to do work there. And he decided that he'd make more wages by
[00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.580] coming home and putting the crop in and helping Mother than he could back there. And I think
[00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:12.580] he could, because we couldn't even afford two pairs of shoes for any of us.
[00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:21.580] Geez. So you moved out here. What's your impression of the High Line and people who
[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.580] live here? Do they like living here?
[00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.580] I think most of them do. I think those that don't get up and move.
[00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:33.580] What is it that you or that people express to you that they like about the High Line?
[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:40.580] Friendliness, mostly. Because I have just as many friends, I believe, in Haver as I have
[00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:47.580] in any of the small towns. And I probably know at least 20 people in every town along
[00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.580] the High Line. In the town of Joplin, Inverness, and Rudyard, I know more than that. Because
[00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.580] some of them are neighbors that used to live there.
[00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.580] Some of them are neighbors that used to be out here, but they've had to move to the High
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:03.580] Line for school. Now my brother up there, it was six miles north, his children, ride
[00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:10.580] the bus clear to Joplin. That's once in and back. That makes a long trip.
[00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.580] Makes a long day.
[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.580] Makes a long day for children. Say nothing about grownups.
[00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:15.580] Right.
[00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.580] And then Pa and Ma sitting home wondering if the bus is going to make it.
[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.580] Nowadays with the phone, it's near so bad.
[00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:22.580] Uh-huh.
[00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:24.580] Oh, that's okay.
[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:25.580] I thought she was going to jump it.
[00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.580] I will just put the cover on and then we won't have to worry about our friend here
[00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.580] at all.
[00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.580] Yeah.
[00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.580] Is that wobbling again?
[00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:30.580] No, not at all. Don't worry about her.
[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.580] She sees it moving and she…
[00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:46.580] Well, she can play all she wants around it right now.
[00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.580] No, I think most of the folks along the High Line are quite friendly.
[00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:52.580] Uh-huh.
[00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:59.200] And there may be a few that think they have more money than someone else, but as far as
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:04.580] I'm concerned, money doesn't make a person happy.
[00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:11.300] But it would seem like it might have been hard on women in this area.
[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.140] I mean, the men get around just a little bit more here.
[00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:20.580] Your mom had three children, you know, and her husband was gone.
[00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.120] She had to do the farm work.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.020] It was hard on the women.
[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:30.080] I know that because when we were first married, I helped work outside.
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.820] I took—my husband would get up early in the morning, four o'clock, and go out and
[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.960] take the tractor.
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.340] And I'd get up and get breakfast for myself or get breakfast so the girls could try it
[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.320] for him when he'd come in, and he'd eat pancakes.
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:49.360] I'd go out and take the tractor if he came back out.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.560] And I'd come back to the house.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.740] And I'd work around outside and inside.
[00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.060] And go back out and take the tractor.
[00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:01.500] We never figured on the tractor stopping when spring work started.
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.460] I didn't—in harvest, I hauled grain.
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.460] Did you?
[00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.500] In haying time, I drove the truck to haul hay.
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:09.500] Wow.
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.740] How did you stack hay?
[00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:12.740] Did you bale it around here?
[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.780] In the early days, we didn't.
[00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.580] It was loose, and we used an overshot stacker on it.
[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.540] And my husband rigged it up and—
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:26.780] We'd hook a tractor on one side or a truck on one side, bring the fork up so it'd throw
[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.300] it on top, and then someone had to stack it.
[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.300] Yeah.
[00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:31.300] That was—
[00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.300] That wasn't my job.
[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.300] That wasn't your job.
[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:37.780] My job was trying to get it up on top where he could stack it.
[00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.640] So you were driving the tractor—
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.640] Yeah, the tractor.
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:41.640] —for the overshot.
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:47.480] And later on, we put it in bales, and then we put it on a track and put it up inside
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.480] the big barn.
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.480] When did you go—?
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.420] When did you go to baling?
[00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:52.420] Oh.
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:53.420] Do you remember?
[00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.420] Not more than about twenty—let's see, about twenty-five years ago.
[00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.420] Before that, it was all loose.
[00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:03.420] So around 1950 or something like that?
[00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:04.420] Probably.
[00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:09.480] When did you start getting tractors here?
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.240] When did you stop using horses?
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:19.240] Well, my dad stopped using tractors with about nineteen—I mean, horses and about
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.000] twenty-three and twenty-four.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000] But was he a special person?
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000] I mean, he knew about tractors.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000] He knew about tractors, but hardly anyone had tractors up until that time.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.380] And then they started coming in.
[00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.740] They were—when did horses really go out?
[00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:36.300] I mean, that's the first time, but—
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:37.740] Pretty close to right then.
[00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:38.740] Really?
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:44.180] And then they came back in as saddle horses, and most people have a saddle horse
[00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:45.180] or two.
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.180] Yeah.
[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.180] But the big workhorses went out—
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:48.180] Workhorses.
[00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:52.940] Well, I probably—I doubt there was very few horses around here in 1930.
[00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:53.940] Is that right?
[00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:58.940] Maybe one or two, but most people had got rid of them by then.
[00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:02.680] So that meant you didn't have to have as much hay.
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:09.120] No, then they went into cattle, so you needed more hay.
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:15.260] And the register stock actually needed more hay than our culls did, because the culls
[00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:16.940] were raised to go out and fight.
[00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:17.940] Oh, yeah.
[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:19.700] Fight for themselves, and they did.
[00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:20.700] Yeah.
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:21.700] Uh-huh.
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.700] But after we went into register stock, we had to have more feed, more grain.
[00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:26.700] When did you start that?
[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.700] I think we started in about 1942.
[00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:33.700] Just as we went into the war?
[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:34.700] About that time.
[00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:35.700] I didn't know.
[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:42.180] No, it was just about exactly that time, because my brother had a—we had an old car.
[00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.180] He had a car.
[00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:46.700] Well, we had the car, and he wanted the car, so we traded it for a registered stock.
[00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:47.700] Oh, yeah.
[00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:53.460] Anyhow, we got a cow for an automobile.
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:59.460] And then you went into beef production, or had you been in beef production before
[00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:00.460] then?
[00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:01.460] Not much, no.
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:02.460] I'd been just mostly cull animals.
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:03.460] Uh-huh.
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:08.460] But then we went into registered stock, and that was for registered cows and—
[00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:09.460] Now what—
[00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:10.460] Sold registered bulls.
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:11.460] What stock?
[00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:12.460] Herefords.
[00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:13.460] You were using Herefords?
[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:14.460] Now, they call them Herefords, or do they call them—
[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:15.460] No, they're Herfords.
[00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:16.460] Oh, okay.
[00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.220] Do they call them Herefords, or do they call them Whiteface here?
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.220] Well, Hereford is a Whiteface.
[00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:22.220] Yeah.
[00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:25.220] But some of your Whitefaces now are black.
[00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:26.220] Right.
[00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:29.220] So they're a crossbreed, but your Angus and your Herefords.
[00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:32.220] What is popular in the High Line?
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:37.220] Right around this area, it's hard to say, because some of them have Simmental, some
[00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:42.220] have Angus, some have Herefords, some have Salyers.
[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:43.220] Salyers?
[00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:44.220] Salyers?
[00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:45.220] Salyers.
[00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:46.980] Salyers?
[00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:47.980] Say it, Louise.
[00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:48.980] Salyers?
[00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:49.980] Salyers.
[00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:50.980] Salyers?
[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:51.980] Salyers.
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:56.980] Is there any feeling that some breeds are better—do better in this climate,
[00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:57.980] this country, than others?
[00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:03.280] Well, I feel right—some of them think right now that they are beefalo, which is
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.280] a buffalo and a bee.
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:07.280] The Herefords are mixed with something.
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.280] Yeah.
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.980] Clyde Owens over here has several beefalos now.
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.980] He's got Chenalic.
[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:22.980] Charlie and Herefords, Angus, are all mixed with beefalo.
[00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:31.040] But one family raises Angus, another family has the Simintols, another Herefords, so each—it's
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.740] whatever family thinks that they think is best.
[00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:35.740] Yeah.
[00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:39.740] I won't buck any of them, because we had Herefords and I liked them.
[00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:40.740] Yeah.
[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:41.740] They're good all-around stock.
[00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:42.740] But what's your—
[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:46.740] But were you then—did you have dairy cattle as well, or—
[00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:54.740] In the early days, my dad had cattle that were Holsteins, Jersey's, and Herefords.
[00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:57.740] So he was milking—
[00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:01.740] We had up to twenty-four cows a day, by hand.
[00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:02.740] By hand.
[00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:03.740] That took a while.
[00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:04.740] It took a while, that's right.
[00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:05.740] And in those days, we had no milking machines.
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:06.740] One year—the year I graduated in nineteen ninety—
[00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:07.740] Nineteen ninety-one.
[00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:08.740] Nineteen ninety-one.
[00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:09.740] Nineteen ninety-one.
[00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:10.740] Nineteen ninety-one.
[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:11.740] Nineteen ninety-one.
[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:12.740] Nineteen ninety-one.
[00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:13.740] Nineteen thirty.
[00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:14.740] Nineteen thirty.
[00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.740] My dad told us we couldn't go anywhere, because we didn't have the money.
[00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:20.740] But if we milked cows, we'd at least have the money.
[00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:25.740] Well, he forgot to tell us if we milked cows we couldn't go, because we had to be there
[00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:26.740] to milk cows.
[00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:32.740] But we did clear a hundred dollars a day—a month—just on those cull cows of ours.
[00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:38.740] Now how would you—how would you get the milk, let's say, to Rudyard or Emerson?
[00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:41.740] We didn't—we separated at home and took the cream.
[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:47.740] Put it in ten-gallon cans and put it in the wagon and hauled it over to the mailbox and
[00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:48.740] the mailman took it to town.
[00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:49.740] And then they shipped it Chinook.
[00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:50.740] Geez.
[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:51.740] To the creamery.
[00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:52.740] So you were just—what were you then doing with the milk?
[00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:53.740] Giving it to the pigs and the cows—cats, chickens, dogs, whatever happened with drinking.
[00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:54.740] Let's think about this.
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:55.740] What animals were you raising?
[00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:56.740] At that point then, you had cattle.
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:57.740] We had cattle.
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:58.740] We had a few horses.
[00:12:58.740 --> 00:12:59.740] And we had two cows.
[00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:00.740] And we had two cows.
[00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:01.740] And we had two cows.
[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:02.740] And we had two cows.
[00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:03.740] And we had two cows.
[00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:04.740] And we had two cows.
[00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:05.740] And we had two cows.
[00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:06.740] And we had two cows.
[00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:07.740] And we had two cows.
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:08.740] And we had two cows.
[00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:09.740] And we had a few horses.
[00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:10.740] And we had pigs and chickens and turkeys.
[00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:11.740] Dogs?
[00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:12.740] Yeah, one dog is all.
[00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:13.740] One dog.
[00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:14.740] One or two cats.
[00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:15.740] Not a mess like we got here.
[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:16.740] Then were there any other animals?
[00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:23.740] Well, some places they raised turkeys and geese.
[00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:36.740] My mother raised turkeys in 1926.
[00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:37.740] That's right.
[00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:38.740] That's right.
[00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:39.740] 1926, 1925, 1924.
[00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:40.740] Not generally.
[00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:45.740] About two or three years and then they were too mature to bother.
[00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:46.740] Yeah, I can see that.
[00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:53.740] They'd stand with their head up in the air and drown.
[00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:56.740] We always raised chickens.
[00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:01.740] That's nice.
[00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:07.740] If we could, when you were working, I mean after you were married and you were living
[00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:08.740] down here.
[00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:12.740] I mean, you had a weekly round of activities that you, you know, sort of what you did
[00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:13.740] on Monday.
[00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:16.740] If we could talk through that.
[00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:23.740] Were there certain things that you did when you were, let's say on Monday, on Tuesday,
[00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:24.740] Wednesday?
[00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:26.740] I can't remember everything.
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:27.740] It was definite.
[00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:28.740] Whatever had to be done.
[00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:32.740] If the garden had to be hoed on a Monday, why it got hoed on a Monday.
[00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:35.740] Or if something had to be done.
[00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:37.740] Of course, farm work came first.
[00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:40.740] Housework was the last thing we did.
[00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:45.740] Were there special days of the week though where there were special activities?
[00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:54.740] In the early days, about 35 and 36, probably 36, they used to have every Saturday a baseball
[00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:55.740] or softball game.
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:15:01.740] And that, there were a few from up in here played, but we played down south of here.
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:06.740] And that group all would not play because of a Sunday ball game.
[00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.740] They wouldn't play on Sunday.
[00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:11.740] And that's why they played on Saturday.
[00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:15.740] Well, some of those that went and played Saturday then worked on Sunday because they
[00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:17.740] played ball on Saturday.
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:22.740] So that's, I guess our family wasn't too religious.
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:27.740] When we were in high school, my dad and sister, we'd go to church on Sundays.
[00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:32.740] He didn't go very often, but we asked the kids either way, and we didn't play ball
[00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:33.740] on the two.
[00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:35.740] He had a riff on us.
[00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:37.740] Is that right?
[00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:42.740] I liked to play basketball, and if I played basketball, I'd better go to—the following
[00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:45.740] Sunday, I'd better be sure I was in church.
[00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:47.740] What church would you go to?
[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:50.740] The one in Rudyard was a Lutheran one.
[00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:52.740] There is a Lutheran church in Rudyard.
[00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:55.740] There are three—were three churches at that time.
[00:15:55.740 --> 00:16:00.740] There was a German Lutheran and a Norwegian Lutheran and the Evangelical.
[00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:04.740] And now there are two churches and a youth center.
[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.740] And that's the Catholic youth center.
[00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:11.740] So there were three churches and they were all Lutheran?
[00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:13.740] No, not near Rudyard.
[00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:17.740] There is the German Lutheran and the Norwegian Lutheran, and then there is the Evangelical
[00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:18.740] one there.
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:19.740] I see.
[00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:22.740] And that wasn't a Lutheran—not an Evangelical Lutheran.
[00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:24.740] It's kind of about, well—
[00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:26.740] Sort of in between.
[00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:30.740] They tried to get them to go into the Lutheran church, and they didn't have much success.
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:31.740] I see.
[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:33.740] So it's kind of a war there, I guess.
[00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:35.740] Oh dear, well.
[00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:40.740] Out here, though, about the closest churches were Catholic churches, and that would be
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:41.740] over at Goldstone.
[00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:44.740] And the Catholics did go on Sunday.
[00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:47.740] Were there French people in this area?
[00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.740] Who were the Catholics in this area?
[00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:59.740] They were mostly from Hungary, Austria, and—oh, in those areas, Yugoslavians.
[00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:02.740] And they were almost all Catholics.
[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:05.740] So you really had a mixed neighborhood here.
[00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:06.740] You had Germans and the Norwegians.
[00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:13.240] Yeah, there was a little bit of everything, because they came from all parts of the—and
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:18.740] this Minneota Hall down here was—they were people from Minnesota and North Dakota and
[00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:20.740] South Dakota, so they called it Minneota.
[00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:23.740] And that's where it got its name.
[00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:28.740] Have you heard—why do they call it the High Line, speaking of names?
[00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:30.740] Well, for a running reason.
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:31.740] Jim Hill put the red flag on it.
[00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:32.740] Oh, yeah.
[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:35.740] And it was a railroad through.
[00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:43.740] And it goes from—you might say twenty—thirty miles from the Canadian line straight across
[00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:44.740] to Montana.
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:48.740] So they just called it the High Line, all the High Line towns.
[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:53.740] And as far as I know, from Browning to Malta, at least called it the High Line.
[00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:57.740] So this is the High Line, from Browning to Malta?
[00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:01.740] It's about—all the way from across, it's just about thirty miles approximately.
[00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:02.740] From the Canadian line, straight across the—you might say the state.
[00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:03.740] Wow.
[00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:04.740] When you go to Browning, you can go north and get closer to Canada.
[00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:05.740] When you go south, you get a little farther away.
[00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:06.740] There you go.
[00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:11.740] Well, the—what about if there wasn't a weekly routine, was there a sort of routine
[00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:12.740] to the year?
[00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:17.740] I mean, if we started off in January, and you think about what you're—what are you
[00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:19.740] doing in the high line?
[00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:24.740] I mean, I think it's—I think it's—I think it's—I think it's—I think it's—I
[00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:29.740] think it's—I think it's—I think it's—I think it's—I think it's—I think it's—I think
[00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:32.740] it's—what are you doing in the High Line in January?
[00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:33.740] In January?
[00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:37.740] Out in this area, not very much, except seeing your youngsters go to school.
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.740] The men probably are working on machinery in the shops.
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:43.740] In those days, you didn't, because you didn't have shops.
[00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:44.740] It's—
[00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:45.740] You just—
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:46.740] —
[00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:47.740] —waiting around.
[00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:53.740] Just getting by, doing your chores, and trying to—whatever you had to do that day,
[00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:54.740] it might be—
[00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:59.740] But how would they—how would they get around at that time in the way that you're
[00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:07.120] wintertime? In the early days we used horses and sleds and in later days it
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:16.840] would be trucks. In 26 my dad used an old Ford truck with a Warford gear in it and
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:20.920] that's about the only way you get around was something that... Well, would he put metal
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:25.220] wheels on it? No, they were regular, but there was a shift, different shift on it.
[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:30.220] So it's more like your four-wheel drive now. It would just go down into a lower gear.
[00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:34.300] So you'd pedal along about two or three miles an hour?
[00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:41.780] A little faster than that, but one trip out we started from Inverness about, what was
[00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:45.800] on the day before Thanksgiving, and I think we left Inverness about four o'clock in the
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:54.000] afternoon. We got out about 16 miles in a blizzard. So we turned around and went back
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.200] a mile because you couldn't see all the way down.
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.480] You couldn't see off the road at all to a place that was right next to the road and
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:03.140] stayed there all night. It took about four hours to come home the next day after the
[00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:12.300] night. It took us a week to get back to school. So it was bad. It was a bad winter in 26,
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:14.580] I mean for that length of time.
[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:21.040] Now as we start into February then, what starts to happen? Do you notice any changes
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.040] up here?
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:25.040] Oh, in those days it was mostly snow.
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:25.140] Oh, in those days it was mostly snow.
[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:25.160] Oh, in those days it was mostly snow.
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.760] Oh, in those days it was mostly playing cards. They'd try to get at least probably
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:33.020] every week. And in those days they'd go to, say, come to my place and I'd finish, everybody
[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:38.780] would bring lunch. And maybe next week we'd go to the Wurleries or the Hunts or somebody
[00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:44.500] else's place. So they had cards at least about once a week to start with, in the early days.
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:47.300] Now they have them about once a month maybe.
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:53.100] But the weather hasn't changed much in February, January?
[00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:55.100] It's still winter.
[00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:56.100] It's still winter.
[00:20:56.100 --> 00:21:01.600] Yeah, winter here. This year we had it until April.
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.320] Was the weather more moderate then?
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:09.540] It seemed to me it was. I mean, I can't remember. I'm at school in the wintertime. I can't
[00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:16.280] ride a horseback. And I miss very little school because of the weather. Now I know I miss
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.280] school.
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.940] Yeah, I know. What about in March then?
[00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:24.080] March is beginning, the farmers begin to get worried about getting their crops in and start
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:24.940] seeing that they're getting a lot of snow.
[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:25.780] But the weather's getting worse.
[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:26.780] They get a lot of snow.
[00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:27.780] Yeah.
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:28.780] And they don't know how to get their machinery's all ready to go.
[00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:29.780] Uh-huh.
[00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:31.320] They didn't in those days and they do then now.
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:42.060] Yeah. So do you disk here or do you actually plow? Now I—and do you have to pick stones?
[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:47.600] We still, still use a rock picker on the rocks.
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:48.600] You do?
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.080] And I said that's one thing that grows good. I swear every year they're getting more rock
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.080] picked and they have to go.
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.080] Yeah.
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:54.080] I mean, they're still in the use of the rocks.
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.840] There were more rocks than there was a year before.
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:58.840] What's a rock picker?
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:05.200] You put it on the head of your—or behind your tractor, and it picks up rocks
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:11.640] anywhere like this and puts it up into a carrier, and then you dump them at the end of the field
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.640] or wherever you want to put them.
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.640] In the early days, we picked them by hand.
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.640] You hand-picked rocks.
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:20.640] I hope you didn't have too much of an area to pick.
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:26.640] Well, my husband had—they had 320 acres here, and that used to be where they picked them.
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.640] 320 acres, rock picking.
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:32.640] And then his sister had 320 right—joining him.
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:36.640] How long would that take, a week?
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:40.640] It depends how bad your—some places it took all summer.
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:44.640] If you had any spare time, you spent it on picking rocks.
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:48.640] But it depends on how—or how much—sometimes it was sod, and it was easier.
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.640] You could see what you wanted.
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:51.640] Yeah.
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.640] And you'd just pick them up.
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:58.640] Well, when we were talking in town, you were mentioning about—that you used to use big fields,
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:02.640] and that you then changed over into strips.
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.640] When was that?
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:08.640] Well, I know they changed in 30—in 35.
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.640] I was married in 36.
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.640] And we had large fields then.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:20.640] And the next spring, the spring of 36, after we were 37, we had smaller—we went into 20-acre fields.
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:24.640] Now, what—a 20-acre field is one of those strip—
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.640] Yes, about 20 rods wide.
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.640] 20 rods long, wide, and—
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:29.640] Half—oh, well.
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:30.640] Half mile long?
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.640] Most of ours were half mile.
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:33.640] Wow.
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:36.640] And what was the idea behind that?
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:42.640] In the early days, your big fields, the wind would start blowing and start moving your soil,
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.640] which they called the erosion.
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:47.640] And they tried—was trying to stop it.
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:48.640] In some places, not right here, but—
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:49.640] Right.
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:53.640] Not right here, but someplace they planted trees between each field then.
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.640] But we didn't.
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:58.640] We just put them down into a smaller field all the time.
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.640] So what would you plant in between your rows of wheat?
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:05.640] There would be nothing—summer falling in one group.
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:08.640] And wheat, and then summer falling.
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:14.640] Or they might leave it for stubble to keep—to start with, and then they'd put—
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.640] get it ready for the next year of planting.
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.640] So what does summer following do?
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:23.640] It would seem like that dirt would blow away better than having it in wheat.
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:28.640] No, and there you have your stubbles that aren't drilled or worked in so well.
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.640] And they would help hold.
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:31.640] I see.
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:39.640] And you—so—and that seems to save moisture, and it also saves the wheat from—or ground
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:40.640] from blowing.
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:44.640] But it cuts down the amount of wheat you can—
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:45.640] That and the government.
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:46.640] Yeah.
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.640] What, do they still regulate?
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:49.640] Yeah.
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.640] You're only allowed so much to plant.
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:56.640] And if you're over-planted, you have to get rid of it.
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:03.640] Either cut it down, or plow it under, or one-way it under, or disk it under, or something.
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:10.640] So do people over-plant and then disk the part that doesn't look so good?
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:15.640] They sometimes do that, or they sometimes—now this year we over-planted a little strip out
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:16.640] here.
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:19.640] In fact, he thought he was under-seeded, so then he planted that strip, and then he
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:22.640] was over-seeded, so he just plowed it under—or one-wayed it under.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.640] Uh-huh.
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:26.640] Duckwood, I don't know what you used on it, but—
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.640] What's one-way?
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:31.640] One-way is a—it looks something like the old disks used to be.
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:36.640] It was a big metal disk, and it cuts.
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:37.640] Huh.
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.640] Never heard it called a one-way.
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:43.640] Oh, I think they got another name for it now.
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:44.640] They used to be called a disk, and then they went into the one-way.
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:45.640] Oh, I see.
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:46.640] And then they went into the one-way, and—
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:47.640] Yeah.
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:48.640] I can't think what they're called.
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.640] Where'd we get?
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:50.640] We got up into March, and they're thinking about—
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:51.640] April's the time when they started trying to get into the field then, trying to plant.
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:52.640] Really?
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:53.640] It has got—seems to me it's got later now.
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:54.640] It's generally about the last of April before you can plant, or the first of May.
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:55.640] So the first you'd have to pick—can you pick in March?
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:56.640] Can you pick stones?
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:57.640] Or would you pick before you plowed?
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:58.640] It seemed like—
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:25:59.640] Yeah, I think it was—I think it was—I think it was—I think it was—I think it
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:00.640] was—I think it was—I think it was—I think it was—I think it was—I think it was—I think
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.880] it was—I think it was Chicago.
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:06.940] Sponge I don't know what that sounds like, but it's—that's characteristic of Maine
[00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:07.940] in terms of people-
[00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:08.940] Yeah.
[00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:09.940] No, sir.
[00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:10.940] —the played the third—
[00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:11.940] No.
[00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:12.940] On the Little River River.
[00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:13.940] The gosto had never been—
[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:14.940] I like that.
[00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:15.940] Just like when we were growing trees and just left them to us.
[00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:16.940] That'sathat.
[00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:17.940] I don't think it was like that, no.
[00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:18.940] How did you know they were planting stones?
[00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:19.940] Why did you believe him?
[00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:20.940] We did not.
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:21.940] At nap while, Mr. Kim showed up over a bulbs rich, I guess.
[00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:22.940] It's good.
[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:23.940] We went over a front of the town,specialized retail, but let's get to the point of
[00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:24.940] the apoyees, the里ons.
[00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:25.940] Well they—
[00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:26.940] We did who do the—
[00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:27.940] Did who?
[00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:34.180] How long would it take to plow 320 acres?
[00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:37.400] Depends on how steady they go at it.
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:45.500] The way it is now, they won't allow you to plow that much.
[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:50.780] I mean if you had 320 acres you would have to at least put half of it that wasn't plowed
[00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:51.780] up.
[00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:59.020] I couldn't tell you right offhand because I don't remember how much Dad's bigger
[00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:04.280] machine would take, but the smaller machines because you go faster with them.
[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:11.020] You have less behind you, but I just couldn't say.
[00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:17.220] Was there a special way that you'd plow a field?
[00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:21.220] I mean I see these almost look like works of art, you know, the way the wheat comes
[00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:21.720] up.
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:28.120] I wonder, was there a special way that people felt a field ought to look after it had been
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:29.120] plowed?
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:33.720] Yes, I'm afraid there was because they thought a lot of places it looked more like
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:37.760] a checkerboard and your field should pretty well match.
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:42.960] They wanted them to be even and weedless as near as possible.
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:51.280] But how, I mean let's say you've got this, that's 20 rods wide, half mile long.
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:54.980] Was there a sort of approved way to make the corner?
[00:27:54.980 --> 00:28:00.040] Did the rows have to look a certain way?
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:06.280] I think they had to because most of them tried to keep their fields so they looked even across
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:11.480] the ends and if you look down a row of wheat you can see right on down.
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:14.120] Yeah, that's pretty.
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:17.880] I know it's sometimes hard to make those corners.
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:18.880] Yeah.
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:20.280] Were there some people who were known to be better?
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:21.280] Oh yeah.
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:24.280] Plowmen or women than others?
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.280] Definitely.
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:29.180] Some are good farmers, some are never known to be a good farmer.
[00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:34.540] Maybe they were a good farmer in their way but they were just not, some of them if they
[00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:35.540] were slower.
[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:42.080] They didn't consider they were a good farmer but they might be a good farmer yet.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:46.120] Some people like to work days, some people like to work nights.
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:50.280] And around most of the people if they worked nights they didn't figure they were very good
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:51.280] farmers.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:55.280] But they could stand the night while they didn't like the heat.
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.280] Yeah.
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:59.280] And I can't see that they make any difference if you want to go out and work when it's
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.280] 110 or whether you want to go out when it's about 65 and work.
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:07.280] Yeah, well, the temperature sounds like it could win me over.
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.280] I don't know about the others.
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:11.280] I don't like to work at night so I wouldn't be out.
[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:15.280] Of course I don't go out during the day so I'm not taught either.
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.280] Well, so then in April—
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:18.280] In the—
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:19.280] We did—they put a—
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:20.280] They put a—
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.280] They plow?
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:22.280] Get ready to put the grout in.
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:27.280] In the early days it would be probably plowed and then they would probably disk it.
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:28.280] Disk it?
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.280] And drill it.
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:30.280] And then drill it?
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:31.280] Yeah.
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:32.280] Then harrow it?
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:33.280] They might have harrowed it before they—after they disked it.
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:34.280] Is that right?
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:35.280] They don't—very few harrow at all anymore.
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:36.280] About the only time we ever harrowed was just to get like a potato patch or where we wanted
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:37.280] to put it.
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:38.280] Yeah.
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:39.280] And then they would just—
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.280] Yeah.
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:41.280] They would just—
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:42.280] Yeah.
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.280] They would just—
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.280] Yeah.
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:45.280] They would just—
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:46.280] Yeah.
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:47.280] They would just—
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:48.280] Yeah.
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:49.280] Yeah.
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:50.280] And then they would just choke it to a—
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:51.280] Well, they'd just—
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:52.280] And they'd have totor's you're what you did.
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:53.280] Yeah.
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:54.280] Yeah.
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:55.280] Where we wanted the clods down—
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:56.280] Yeah.
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.280] Real smooth.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.280] I see.
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.280] But in wheat, you'd be—did you change your grass fields from year to year?
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:00.280] I mean, would you rotate a—
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:01.280] Not grass, but you would your feed—your grains.
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:03.760] I was just wondering, like if you're putting up hay, would you move your
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:04.760] hay?
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:09.880] No, our hay patches would stay the same because they were just hay—hay fields.
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:14.160] They weren't—we had one up in San Francisco.
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:15.960] So they were—
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:17.760] That's nice.
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:18.760] You—
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:23.520] We have one up here that's an alfalfa field, one up this way that's an alfalfa field.
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:26.080] And the pastures were always the same place.
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.080] Timothy?
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:28.080] Mostly?
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:32.080] No, mostly now it's alfalfa and sweet clover.
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:38.320] In fact, the sweet clover has taken over a lot of things.
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:49.020] I don't know, to me it seems like there's a lot of changes, but it's more modern
[00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:54.560] farming and you do more in one day than what you used to do maybe in a week.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:55.560] Sure.
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:31:01.440] Because with your tractors and your bigger machinery, so you do more.
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:06.000] Would you be finished pretty much with plowing in April?
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000] I mean, with planting in April?
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:08.120] Yeah.
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:12.140] By the first week in May, they generally were through.
[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:17.100] This year we weren't, but then it was one of those crazy years again where you had a
[00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:19.800] bad spring too.
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:22.800] Our last blizzard was the 24th of April.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:31.640] I was in the hospital and she drove from Chester to Red Yard back in a blizzard that night.
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:34.600] So we couldn't do anything out here.
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:36.520] What happens then?
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.000] We start into the summer.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.820] What do the farm families do?
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:47.660] In June and July and August, especially the first part of August, mostly keeping your
[00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:51.080] summer fawn clean.
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:32:00.000] And nowadays they work with insecticides or insect poisoning.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:07.000] In those days we had very little except in 23 when the grasshoppers decided to take everything
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000] over.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.080] They had a yelled out constant even little insecticide and tomato.
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:13.120] But in 2018 and March, this was really fell out in there.
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.500] It worked out pretty
[00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:15.500] well.
[00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:23.500] And that's how it had switched to pocket initiative, to
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:24.500] plant-based.
[00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:27.660] It fry-ely Benacco and When you grew up that
[00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:32.960] 早
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:33.740] down, I could see them all.
[00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:34.760] They at least worked single time.
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:36.300] Yeah, they working them.
[00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:36.660] Then up.
[00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:37.420] Will I need your interest?
[00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:37.800] No.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:46.080] Thank you.
