[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.520] Okay, we're back again here on tape number two at the LA Fish Company.
[00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.260] Everything sounds fine.
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.560] You mentioned shipping, that was something that your company specialized in?
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.420] Ours was to fish the crew, that's what I mean.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:39.520] The ship business, that part of our business had never been really stepped on by anybody else or fought for.
[00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.460] It was more generally known that we handled the ships.
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.520] Our competition would send that type of business to us, but we would send them their type of business.
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.760] Ours is the type of business to go in and say,
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.520] I want to order 10 tons of fish.
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.160] Macro.
[00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.480] If somebody came to me with an order like that, I would send them to either Ocean Fish, State Fish,
[00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.540] Tomlin's Brothers, someplace else on the dock,
[00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.420] as they would in turn send somebody down to me.
[00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.680] So it's sort of a general, we may argue and fight, but we are kind of close down there.
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.680] It's different.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.360] Well, it's way back because everyone's sort of related.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.900] One way or the other, they're all related.
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.920] If your company then is characterized by the merchant marine trade, the shipping trade,
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.920] how would you characterize the others down the war period?
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.500] If you want me to, I can give you a quick...
[00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.000] Sure.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:51.800] Now Catalina Fish is a large supplier to Greece and England, squid, mackerel, boletus.
[00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.540] Standard Seafood is a small grocery store, restaurant,
[00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:07.480] and local people pick up fish there from their stores, like by the Mexican stores and restaurants.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.520] A lot of restaurants that handle quite a few restaurants.
[00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.400] Star Fisheries, the next one over, handles the large...
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.020] Supermarkets.
[00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.760] Supermarkets.
[00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.080] Solely, that is their main business is large supermarkets.
[00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:28.520] Ocean Fish is also a supplier to Greece and England in the foreign trade.
[00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.540] Do a little local trade.
[00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.540] A few stores in downtown Los Angeles.
[00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:40.540] Independent Fish, theirs is a more...
[00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.540] Oh, how can I...
[00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.540] Wait.
[00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.540] Theirs is different than anybody else's so far.
[00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.540] Theirs is a...
[00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.540] They handle these large wholesale houses.
[00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.540] Newport, they get fish in from up north and they send it all over.
[00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.540] They get a lot of fresh fish in off the boats.
[00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.040] And they're very, very good.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.540] They're very, very good.
[00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.040] They're very, very good.
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.220] They're very, very good.
[00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.540] They're very, very good.
[00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.540] They'll get swordfish.
[00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.540] Large suppliers of swordfish.
[00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.540] Local salmon.
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.540] And halibut.
[00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.540] Northern halibut, local halibut.
[00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.540] They handle most of that fish.
[00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.540] Pioneer Fish handles a lot of what they would call, Chinese trade,
[00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.540] Japanese trade with local fish.
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.540] Tomage also is a, Tomage Brothers, another market also handles a lot of foreign trade.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.220] A lot of trading in swordfish.
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:40.460] fish, squid, mackerel, tuna, large tuna traders. Then there's state fish, the largest of all.
[00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:46.980] They handle, they are worldwide. Also, Thomas is worldwide, the state would be the largest
[00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.980] all over the world. They would handle anything, anywhere, anything.
[00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.880] And like state, hey, in all of the United States, their frozen fish would be in the
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.880] supermarkets. You don't find them anywhere in the United States. They're a product.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:07.880] They're labeled Del Mar fish. Yes, the Del Mar. That's the end of it.
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.880] Some of these companies have freezer facilities right here?
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:20.880] State Fish has three freezing plants that they own. Two they own, one is leased from the Harvard Department.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.880] And are they located in this area? No, in Wilmington.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.880] Oh, yeah. In Wilmington.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.880] Okay.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.880] And you, I believe you all have your own freezers here, though.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:36.880] We have our own freezer plant, our own freezer in the market and cooler. But LA Fish Store
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:43.880] is at Union Ice in Wilmington. And we buy out of Los Angeles storage, and we don't store
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:49.880] up there. But a lot of companies do store up there, but we don't. We are one of the
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.880] oldest customers at Union Ice that are still with them.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.880] Do you all own your own trucks?
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:04.880] All own our own trucks. Some lease them. The larger trucks. Most of them own them.
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.880] Starfish leases their trucks. We don't have such a large fleet.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.880] I don't know what state they own them. I don't know.
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.880] I don't know about the other places.
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:14.880] That's a big outfit state.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.880] Yeah. They're the big ones. The big companies will do whatever they want. It's normal.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.880] Where we try to own our own.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:31.880] We don't care. We don't have our own refrigerated trucks. They're just regular open. I mean
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.880] vans. We used to have open trucks, but no more.
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.880] How many people work for your company now?
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.880] Five.
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:47.880] Or six. I work part time. We used to be 12 at one time.
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.880] How long ago was that?
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.880] Oh, 15, 20 years ago.
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:53.880] Yeah.
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:54.880] Yeah, about 20 years.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:55.880] Right.
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.880] And as soon as the local fish started to, you know, dwindle.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.880] We didn't need a fillet man.
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.880] We didn't need anyone to fillet. Yeah, you know.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:10.880] Two people to fillet or two or three people to pack. There wasn't any production in the fish.
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.880] So we didn't need the people.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.880] What we needed today was two drivers and two people in the market.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:18.880] Mm-hmm.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:19.880] Well, none of us get sick.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:20.880] We're all right.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:21.880] We'll survive.
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.880] Now, the other young fellow sitting at the table, is that your son?
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.880] That was my son, John.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:29.880] Mm-hmm.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:35.880] He's, he started working at what, about six, seven months ago?
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:36.880] No, a year and a half.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.880] A year and a half.
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:38.880] A year and a half. Time flies.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.880] Time flies as we get older.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:41.880] Yeah.
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:42.880] Yeah.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:43.880] And what are his responsibilities?
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.880] Driving and helping put up orders.
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:47.880] Mm-hmm.
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:48.880] Taking the local, driving the local orders.
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:49.880] Mm-hmm.
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:50.880] Then my other son, he drives LA.
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:51.880] He takes the Los Angeles one.
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:52.880] What's his name?
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:53.880] Sean.
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:54.880] Mm-hmm.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:55.880] And Lucille, we know, works on the books and works in the office.
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:56.880] Well, Janet is the other girl.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.880] Janet Frisina.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:58.880] Mm-hmm.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:59.880] And what is your husband's?
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:00.880] Augustine.
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:01.880] He's really the, he's the backbone.
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:02.880] Uh-huh.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.880] He'll, he's the worker.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:04.880] Yeah.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:05.880] He's a very hard worker.
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:06.880] They even broke the mold with it.
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:08.880] I mean, he does the work.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:09.880] He's the one that's the most important.
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:10.880] Yeah.
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:11.880] He's the one that's the most important.
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:12.880] Yeah.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:13.880] He's the one that's the most important.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:14.880] Yeah.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:15.880] He's the one that's the most important.
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:16.880] Yeah.
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:17.880] He was the one that broke the mold with it.
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:18.880] Yeah, he is.
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.520] I mean, he does everything.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.800] He fillets.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:28.040] He couldn't find a person more, you know, really a company man.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.360] I don't know what you would call him.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.700] See, my dad even had a fourth interest in the Union Fish Company in San Diego.
[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.360] He was really...
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.900] They broke the mold when my dad passed away, too.
[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.840] He was a self-made man.
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.260] He really was.
[00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.920] And after he passed away, it's just, I don't know.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:46.880] Well.
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:08:15.880] different to them. Yeah, times have changed. My grandfather passed away, times have changed, and it just started going the other way. It seemed like for a while that there wasn't going to be any fish industry. What I think really brought the fish industry back was after the Vietnam War, the Vietnamese and the Korean influx into the Los Angeles area.
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:22.880] They eat fish in the Filipino community. They eat fish and they have to have it.
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:29.880] I think the Filipinos eat more than the Vietnamese. Yeah, but we don't see them. They're different people.
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:35.880] No, what do you mean? Well, you don't see the Vietnamese and the Koreans too much here.
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:44.880] We have a few Koreans that walk in. No Vietnamese. They have their own. But they have their own people to look into.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:50.880] But for a while it looked like there wasn't going to be any fish industry.
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:58.880] Why is that? There was just no fish and there was no interest in it until people changed their diets.
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:08.880] Weight watchers eat more fish. Fish is good for you. It's low in cholesterol. People worry more about their heart.
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:13.880] And then they wanted more of the white fish, different fishes.
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:18.880] You know, the halibuts and salmon and stuff like that.
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:23.880] Because if you notice, your supermarkets have these large fish displays. They never had that before.
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:28.880] In fact, they didn't even deal with fish. And now they all have the one section just for fish.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:36.880] Right. It's sort of taken a little change. It's become more expensive.
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:43.880] Like your macros and stuff. We just didn't have any. We didn't have any macro for five, seven years.
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:48.880] There wasn't any. And there wasn't any squid for five years.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:56.880] Because they blame it on El Nino. Let's say El Nino. But we blame a lot of it on pollution.
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.880] What is El Nino telling us? That was a storm down in Mexico.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:10.880] El Nino starts from South America. It's a change in the water.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.880] Temperature and your winds are different.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:17.880] And your currents, they lose currents.
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:24.880] But we lost five years on the squid and almost ten, I'd say close to ten years on macros.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:30.880] We used to sell nothing but the American macro to the Japanese here. Spanish macro.
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:41.880] Once we lost the American macro, the Japanese import of their, what they call Saba, which was a large American macro,
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:42.880] took over.
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:48.880] And we've never been able to recover that line of fish.
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:53.880] We have the American macro again, but still they want their Saba from Japan.
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.880] So it's due to a lot of imports and stuff like that.
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.880] We could switch back and they could have heavy tariff on it.
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.880] But the Japanese will pay the price for any type of fish.
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:10.880] Tell me about the principal types of fish that you do handle today.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.880] The American macro, Spanish.
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:14.880] That's your local fish.
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.880] Local fish, Spanish macro.
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.880] Squid.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.880] What else can we say? Local halibut.
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:24.880] Some very small local sea bass.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.880] Local barracuda.
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:33.880] But you know, it's the Orientals that will eat the dark fish like this.
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:34.880] Dark meat fish.
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.880] This macro and squid and all that.
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.880] Where the American can't tell.
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.880] Your fillets and your swordfish and shrimp.
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:42.880] They eat differently.
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.880] Swordfish also is a local fish.
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.880] There haven't been any so far.
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.880] Shark is a big one.
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.880] That was due to Jaws.
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:56.880] Everybody wanted to eat the shark and killed everybody.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.880] So they started using these thrashers.
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.880] Thrasher shark.
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.880] That's another local fish.
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:07.880] Lobsters, they're a lobster season.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.880] Local crab.
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.880] What are the non-local types that you handle?
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:20.880] Well, we handle a lot of northern halibut, salmon.
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:21.880] Filets.
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.880] Filets, filets, all the filets.
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:24.880] Filet snapper.
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.880] Filet lingon.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.880] Filet sole.
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.880] Skillet rex.
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:35.880] There's a whole list of flounder.
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.880] That's just our fresh fish.
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.880] And frozen.
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.880] Frozen is maybe 40, 50 items.
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:44.880] Yeah.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.880] Any type of fish you can think of.
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:47.880] They're frozen.
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:48.880] They're frozen.
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:55.880] You were talking a moment ago about different preferences among different ethnic groups.
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:56.880] Yes.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.880] In fact, we were talking about that on Saturday.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:01.880] We were remembering different people coming in.
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:06.880] And you mentioned, among other things, how the taste of black.
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.880] The taste of black seemed to have changed.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.880] Can you tell me more about that or just recall that?
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:17.880] Well, I think it's due to economics.
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.880] We just don't have that trait anymore.
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.880] The black will eat a different type of fish.
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:29.880] Now, the ones we get from, like I was telling you, from Los Angeles, they will eat the filet
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:35.880] snapper where before they would buy the collars and take care of their children with the cheaper
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:36.880] type fish.
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:43.880] Now it's more expensive, but it's a better type of fish.
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.880] The filet snapper.
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.880] Skinless, salt, and sand antler.
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:49.880] They're going into more expensive fish.
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:50.880] More expensive.
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:51.880] And they can pay for it.
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:57.880] Now, the blacks that come from South Africa will eat the mackerel and the shark.
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:01.880] The blacks from here will not eat the mackerel and the shark.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:02.880] They will eat the catfish.
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.880] We don't see them.
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:05.880] They don't want catfish.
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:06.880] They don't want catfish anymore.
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:07.880] They want either to be able to stake it or filet it.
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:08.880] They don't want to do it themselves anymore.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:09.880] They'd rather have another.
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:10.880] So actually each ethnic group has changed.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:11.880] What are the preferences of some of the other groups that come to the Whitefish?
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:30.880] Well, the Filipinos are still eating the mackerel, Spanish mackerel, the dark
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:31.880] finned octopus.
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:32.880] Octopus.
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:33.880] They like octopus.
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:34.880] They'll eat.
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:36.880] I'm not saying they're not going to eat.
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:37.880] I'm just saying they eat a lot.
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:38.880] Because most of them are first generation here.
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:39.880] We have some young ones coming in that they're just going on.
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:40.880] They like the filets.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:41.880] They will really have a filet snacker and a boiled fish.
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:50.880] Then we have the Japanese, they'll eat most of their tuna and the squid.
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.880] Their fish has to be very good.
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:53.880] I mean, they will not eat.
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:54.880] They have to be top of the line fish.
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:55.880] But most of the people, they want.
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:56.880] They're not going to eat the mackerel.
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:57.880] They're going to eat the fish.
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:58.880] They're going to have to have a plate of the fish.
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:14:59.880] They're going to have to have a plate of the fish.
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:00.880] I don't know.
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:01.880] I don't know if I'm being too harsh.
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:02.880] I know that's true.
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:09.680] they want that has to be pretty good though it's not you can't give people today
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.520] joke you have to give them a quality product
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:20.560] and that's what we try to do like you saw down there we're trying to keep the place clean neat
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:26.720] and presentable for the public well it certainly is tell me about the saturday market and how long
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:33.920] that's been existing it's not a year for us yeah that's all you know we always were open yeah
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:41.200] and all of a sudden it just bloomed into it's just it's word of mouth what what happens one
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:46.080] will tell her friend oh i i got fish saturday down there oh it's really good and that's how
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:52.240] it really started it's just weird man it's just we were open always on saturdays at eight o'clock
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:56.160] now we open at six and the other markets open at four so open up
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:00.240] at six and we open at six and we open at six and we open at six and we open at six
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:07.440] naturally enough yeah let's see can i get you to pin that a little higher i mean i think that your
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:17.680] your necklace might be uh oh there you go okay that's simple okay uh how early do you open six
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:24.560] six o'clock what time of day do you usually open the throughout the rest of the week six okay so
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:26.560] just another one but saturday saturday saturday saturday saturday saturday saturday saturday saturday
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:32.160] saturday no saturday they close at noon but they would come down at eight before now they have to
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:38.320] come down at six right well what was the the impetus for starting the saturday market here
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:45.680] because of the leftover fish from the week during the week you know usually most of the fish from
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:52.560] thursday to saturday nothing from monday till saturday it was usually from thursday friday
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:56.240] and then saturday would be sold but wasn't sold on saturday would be frozen
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:01.720] anything Monday through Wednesday, if there's anything left on Wednesday, we freeze on Wednesday.
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.720] So it's like a three day period that we freeze.
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:11.720] To freeze that fish fresh, because the way you put it in is the way it's going to come out.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:16.720] So we want a fresh product coming out of the freezer with a good smell and a good taste.
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.720] Do all the fish companies here have a Saturday Market?
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:24.720] All of them, except maybe one or two.
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:27.720] But they're all open. They're all here except for one.
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.720] There's actually one market now.
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:34.720] Well how do you all feel about that? Is it a nuisance or is it a good source of income?
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.720] It's a good source of income.
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:43.720] I feel myself that we're doing them a service because they're...
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.720] It's wholesale. It's a much cheaper form.
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.720] It's a much cheaper form.
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.720] And they want fresh fish.
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.720] And they pick out what they want.
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:54.720] And they get the fish.
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:55.720] They pick out what they want.
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.720] It's more like an open market, but it isn't.
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.720] It's indoors.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.720] It's fun. It's sometimes.
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:03.720] I think it's...
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.720] They think they're back in the Philippines, really, where they have these open markets.
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:10.720] And I think that's what they like about it.
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:11.720] I really do.
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:14.720] It isn't like if they go to a grocery store, it's behind the counter.
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.720] This way they can put their hands right on it.
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.720] We've met quite a few people, made friends with quite a few of them.
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:23.720] We have what we call repeat customers.
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:24.720] Yeah.
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:25.720] So you see that?
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:26.720] Yeah.
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:27.720] You would expect that, you know.
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:28.720] Yeah.
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:29.720] You know what a lot of people go to this place.
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:30.720] I mean, I've seen some of them eat fish roe, but I don't know.
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:31.720] I want to eat this.
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.720] I want to eat this.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:33.720] I want to eat this.
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.720] I'm not sure.
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:35.720] I think we all have some food that's coming from here.
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:36.720] It's different.
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:38.720] Yeah.
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:39.720] Some of the stuff.
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:40.720] Some of the stuff they eat.
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:41.720] I don't know.
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:42.720] Like what?
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:43.720] I don't know.
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:44.720] They eat the heads and the insides, and they eat everything.
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:45.720] They like it all.
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:46.720] Yeah.
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.720] As long as it's fresh, they'll eat it.
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:48.720] Hmm.
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:49.720] I grew up in Maine, and that's a big fishery area.
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:56.720] As I've lived in different parts of the country, I see that people sometimes have different
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:01.720] names for the same type of fish, and I'm wondering if you had encountered that here too.
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:02.720] Snapper is...
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.720] Snapper is, I think has about 25 different names.
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.720] Right, but we call it Red Saffron here.
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:14.720] The people from Florida had a lawsuit, wanted us to call it Rockon, but now we call it Pacific
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:15.720] Red Saffron.
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.720] So that's been cleared up.
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:22.720] We call lobster lobster, you call lobster, you call our lobster crayfish.
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.720] Jackie's wife's from New Hampshire.
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.720] We've had them back there three times.
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.720] Last year I was in Maine.
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:30.720] Oh yeah.
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:34.720] I went all up down Maine, I was through Vermont, I spent two weeks there.
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:38.720] I like it, to tell you the truth, I like it back there.
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.720] I do.
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.720] We're only going to stop in one place.
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:45.720] We're going on a cruise, we're going to Montreal, and then we're going to go, I guess it's
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:46.720] to St. Lawrence.
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:47.720] And then we're going to end up in New Hampshire.
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.720] We're going to Nova Scotia, then we're going to go, just go to Portland.
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.720] That's the only place in Maine we're stopping.
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.720] Is there anything special to see in Portland?
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.720] Well, we'll talk about that later.
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.720] I'll be happy to give you some advice.
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:19:59.720] Oh, I forgot.
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.720] Well, that's fine.
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:07.720] Getting back to the names of fish, are there names that fishermen and people use here that
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:10.720] wouldn't necessarily be recognized elsewhere?
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.720] No, not really.
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:16.720] Well, Bucaccio might not be recognized someplace else.
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:22.720] When you're looking at the fish that are not recognized elsewhere, it's not a fish.
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:29.720] There are some fish that are not recognized elsewhere.
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:37.720] There's a fish called sculpin, or we call them scorpion, which is a sculpin, which is
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:40.720] what most people understand as a sculpin.
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:41.720] No, I don't think so.
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:42.720] Mackerel is a mackerel.
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.720] Sea bass is a sea bass.
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:44.720] We haven't changed any names.
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:45.720] I don't think there is any fish that would be different.
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:54.720] What about Italian-run fish companies and the fishermen? Are there Italian words that are used for the fish?
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:21:01.720] Well, yeah, there'll be Italian words. Like your husband, the Genoese have different names.
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.720] Well, that's a dialect now. That's a dialect, yeah.
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.720] That's a dialect, that's from Genoa.
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:12.720] No, but I don't know. What would that be? God, we don't hear it too often anymore.
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:15.720] I know.
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.720] That's something.
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:22.720] I've been here 25 years, and it's like, well, it hurts.
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.720] But here it goes.
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:28.720] I can only remember my dad's. Of course, he always spoke English to us.
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.720] Right. That's our problem.
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.720] That's our problem.
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.720] He spoke nothing but English.
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:41.720] To us. I can understand Italian, but I can't speak it, which I'm very, which I learned.
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:42.720] It is.
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.720] He never spoke Italian to any of us.
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.720] No. He only spoke English.
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.720] He loved it. He loved it.
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:53.720] And all my aunts, my mother came here in 1902, and they went to school here.
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.720] So none of my aunts, really, none of them ever spoke Italian.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:05.720] Which was, in my husband's household, they did speak Italian.
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:11.720] Because his mother came here older. She was 16, and she settled in Santa Barbara.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:15.720] And they spoke Italian, because they didn't go to school here.
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.720] Well, the squid would be calamari, because everybody knows calamari.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:22.720] Calamari is squid. And what else? Mackerel is mackerel, even in Italian.
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:23.720] Macadel.
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.720] They just pronounce it differently.
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.720] They never had a name for it.
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:29.720] Now, what would be squid would be?
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:30.720] Calamari.
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.720] Yeah. And what, rock cod is?
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.720] I don't know what rock cod is.
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.720] I don't know.
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:38.720] I don't know.
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:39.720] I don't know.
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:40.720] I don't know.
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:47.720] But as far as squid, inkfish, it's all the same.
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:55.720] Never was really, we never spoke it as a, doing business with other foreign people,
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:23:00.720] we never, you know, we never were direct Italian to Italian.
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:03.720] We were direct Italian to Japanese.
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:09.720] See, my dad, the problem was my dad was very involved in San Pedro, the civic,
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:14.720] and he was active in the Alps, and he had all kinds of friends, and none of them really were Italian.
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.720] They were all different nationalities.
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:17.720] Right.
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:23.720] So he used to cook down here once a week, and none of them were Italian, you know, really.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:28.720] Judges, lawyers, they were just never Italian.
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:31.720] I don't think anybody down here was Italian to Italian.
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.720] Well, maybe when my uncles were alive, and old Mr. DiMeglio.
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.720] They were going back 40, 50 years.
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.720] I'm going back 40, 50 years.
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:42.720] They didn't make it Italian to Italian, but they dealt with the onsen market.
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:46.720] Yeah, it was all, it was English, you had to speak English.
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:48.720] Right, you had to speak the language.
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.720] Now, see, if he was a fisherman.
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.720] He did great with Japanese, the Italians did great with Japanese.
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:57.720] And now, if he was an Italian, and a fisherman, they would speak the language,
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:00.720] because they're all Italians, and they would speak to each other, fishermen.
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:01.720] Right.
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:04.720] But when you were in business, you have to sort of.
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:07.720] Fishermen to the markets might have been Italian.
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.720] They might have been Italian in those days.
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.720] But not today.
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:13.720] We just don't have that many Italians.
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.720] No.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:17.720] Even Andre, now he hasn't been here that long, the fellow.
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:21.720] And he speaks, I never hear, he'll sing and holler.
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:25.720] And even his wife was born in Sicily, and she speaks English.
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:28.720] We really couldn't, there wasn't, no.
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.720] I can't think of one incident where we would be.
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:36.720] The only times I can remember them speaking Italian is when my mother would get together with her sisters,
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.720] and they wanted to say something they didn't want us to hear.
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.720] And then they would speak.
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:41.720] Otherwise, they never.
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.720] As far as the business, right, no.
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:49.720] Because our relationship with the Japanese and with the Chinese have been so good,
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.720] there's no reason to switch parties.
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:53.720] Yeah.
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.720] Because we get along very well with them.
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:00.720] They understand us, and we understand them.
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:05.720] You were mentioning Andre a moment ago, and I know the other man who sells right here,
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.720] his name is Nick.
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:14.720] Do all these fish companies have men associated with them that sell off trucks like that,
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.720] or how does that work around here?
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:19.720] Well, one time we, every market did.
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:25.720] They would have a peddler or two, Japanese or American, or Jewish, right?
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.720] Yeah, but now there's no more Jewish.
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:28.720] No more Jewish.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:29.720] No more Jewish peddlers.
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.720] Very few Japanese, and very few American.
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.720] American, Italian.
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:37.720] It's just getting less and less.
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:41.720] Well, you would have, where's that picture with the Japanese peddlers?
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.720] See how many, there's only about two or three left.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:51.720] They would have all these Japanese peddlers that would peddle fish into houses and stores.
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:52.720] Well, now.
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:58.720] See, this is what's unique here, is because of our relationship with these people.
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.720] See, now these were the peddlers.
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.720] There was one, two, three, four, five, six.
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:09.720] Seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.720] Maybe thirteen or fourteen peddlers.
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:20.720] And these back here, this is John E., that's Ralph DiMeglio, that's Sam DeLuca, Carmen Beneguino.
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.720] Now they also had Japanese peddlers.
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.720] They had all the Japanese peddlers.
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:29.720] They all, every market had their own.
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.720] So you'd have to say that these markets had a very good relationship.
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:36.720] Well, were these peddlers employees in some way?
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.720] No, no.
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:38.720] They bought from us directly.
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:39.720] They bought.
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:43.720] These were strictly, I know ours was a weekly.
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.720] These were cash almost.
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.720] Well, that's a weekly.
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:49.720] Which we call cash today.
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:56.720] This picture, I'll just put it back on the tape, says L.A. Retail Fish Association, November 27, 1964.
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.720] That was a Japanese retail.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:26:59.720] That's very interesting.
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.720] See, they had their own association.
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:05.720] Once a year, they would take us to dinner.
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:09.720] And then the next year, we would take them to an Italian dinner.
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.720] So it was quite interesting.
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:15.720] Being Italian, I was trying to eat Japanese food.
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:18.720] Or I'd try to eat Chinese food once a year.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.720] Oh, Chinese food.
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:29.720] But the special, the real Chinese food, not the ones that, you know, with the shark fins and all that.
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:30.720] Shark fins.
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.720] And they would drink their unkape.
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.720] That was quite interesting.
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:41.720] Japanese is seaweed and row, herring row, which was very uncommon for Italians.
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.720] Or simonians.
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:44.720] Yeah.
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:45.720] Being down here.
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:49.720] We, you know, it was different than eating what we would eat.
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.720] Mm-hmm.
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:58.720] Are there, in addition to Andre and Nick, are there other fish peddlers that buy from the dealers here?
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:27:59.720] Yes, there are.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:05.720] Maybe three more Japanese, three, four more Japanese peddlers.
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:10.720] Now we get into what we call a black peddler.
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:14.720] There's two that go to standard fisheries.
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:21.720] And now we have a, it's hard to say now.
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:28.720] We sell to wholesalers who also in turn sell to small truck retailers.
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:33.720] They're becoming a dying breed because of the licensing.
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:38.720] Each county is requiring stricter.
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:39.720] Health licenses.
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:40.720] Health licenses.
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:41.720] Mm-hmm.
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:47.720] And because more and more difficult to sell the way they have been selling for 50 years.
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:48.720] Mm-hmm.
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:52.720] Although none that we know that has ever gotten sick or died.
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.720] But the health laws are much stricter now than they were before.
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.720] Much, much stricter than what they were before.
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:57.720] Which is good.
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:58.720] Mm-hmm.
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.720] Because you do have some people who don't really care.
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:05.720] Rather than before where they cared because they had to take care of their own people.
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:06.720] Mm-hmm.
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:09.720] And this is the reason why there's less and less.
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:13.720] I mean they're asking them to have onboard water, hot water.
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:20.720] Most of the stuff they want filleted out or already gutted.
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:21.720] It has to be cased.
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.720] I mean it has to be under glass, in a glass.
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.720] It's completely different than what it is.
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:26.720] As you saw Nick.
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:32.720] The truck with the folding doors before it was just.
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:33.720] Open.
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:35.720] Open and open an outside door.
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:36.720] Mm-hmm.
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.720] You went into the truck and people would hook you in.
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:39.720] Mm-hmm.
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.720] Like from home to home.
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:41.720] Yeah.
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:43.720] So we're talking home to home type.
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:44.720] Market to home.
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:45.720] Mm-hmm.
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:49.720] Like one of our customers had a truck from the ocean floor to your door.
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:51.720] So this is that type of business.
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:52.720] Mm-hmm.
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.720] So that's becoming a dying breed.
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:55.720] Mm-hmm.
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:56.720] And I think that's what we're expecting from last year to the 10 year.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.720] Mm-hmm.
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:58.720] For most of the health laws.
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:29:59.720] Mm-hmm.
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:00.720] Environmentally they're going to be slowly phased out.
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:01.720] Mm-hmm.
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:02.720] Tell me your principal duties here Jack.
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:03.720] I realize now that I've asked about everyone else I haven't asked you.
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:04.720] Me?
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:05.720] Yeah.
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:06.720] He and Augie have about the same duties.
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:07.720] Well Augie and I have about the same duties.
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:08.720] I try to fillet.
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:09.720] Yeah.
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:10.720] Try to keep up with Augie.
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:11.720] He orders.
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:12.720] He orders the food.
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:13.720] I try to keep up with Augie.
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:14.720] He orders the food.
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:15.720] He orders the food.
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:16.720] He orders the food.
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:17.720] He orders the food.
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:18.720] He orders the food.
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:19.720] He orders the food.
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:20.720] He orders the food.
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:21.720] I call, I answer the phone.
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:22.720] Augie, he sort of, he likes to be on the outside and I'm inside a little bit more than
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:23.720] he is now.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:24.720] And I talk to a few of the people and get the fish from up north, and my uncle still
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.720] buys the fish from the boats.
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:30.720] Because he has a lot of people that he knows and they're friends of his and he goes to
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:31.720] the boats and he can buy fish.
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:32.720] Mm-hmm.
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:33.720] And at the end of the day, I know that he's a good man because he can buy fish.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:34.720] Mm-hmm.
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:35.720] And I think he's a good man because he has a lot of people that he knows and they're
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:36.720] close friends with him.
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:37.720] And I think it's important to give him, to give him something to eat.
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:38.720] Mm-hmm.
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:39.720] It's important that he has some of the things that he can eat.
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:40.720] Mm-hmm.
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:48.400] from the boats because he has a lot of people that he knew and they're friends of his and he goes to
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:53.840] the boats and he can buy fish and i stay in cycles trying to stay in cycles sometimes
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:04.640] oh you know kinetics too i must say your coffee is a little better than there thank you
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:11.680] that's so nasty no that is mostly mine just two of my uncle does we try to
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:16.880] we've been working now the canadians they're related you know that's another
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:23.040] that's a cousin yeah he his mother and my dad were brother and sister
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:27.920] so if you look around here everyone started there's a connection there
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:34.400] we just work together we've been working together so long we almost know
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:41.120] what each other's gonna do yeah yeah you were mentioning uh before a little bit about the
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:47.760] cooperation and the conflict between the dealers uh here on the dock what are what are the ways
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:54.640] that you do help each other out well one market will have a boat come in maybe he's got 20 tons
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:59.120] of tuna he'll call every other market and say i've got some tuna here the boat would like to
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:02.560] sell it to you you know if it's eight minutes you didn't have to call us
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:11.520] come down and get our share we pay the boat and he just you know was coming are we to help each
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:18.080] other one person has a freezer down or an icebox down they put stuff in ours or are we buy fishing
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:27.680] each other and they less than you know cost it's more of a mutual i i don't pack mackerel
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:34.000] freeze it so i buy from state or come to our ocean and we each all fight with each other
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:37.640] We don't want to lose each other.
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:40.640] Because we'll all do something different.
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:43.640] What I don't have today, you may have it tomorrow,
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:46.640] and I can buy it from you, or you can buy it from me.
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:50.640] I can see it's sort of like an extended family then.
