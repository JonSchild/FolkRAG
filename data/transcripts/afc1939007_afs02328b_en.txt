[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920] AFS recording number 2328, side B.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.620] It was all insane down on the main to chase a flying cloud.
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.640] At length the Spanish man o' war the dungeon hold in view.
[00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.780] And she fired a shot across our bow, a signal to ease to.
[00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.600] Oh, we did not seem to mind her.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000] But we sped before the wine.
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:12.340] When a chain shot broke our mizzenmust, and then we fell behind.
[00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:21.080] Oh, we cleared our deck for action as the dungeon rained alongside.
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:28.200] And all along her quarter rail was her flowing crimson tide.
[00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.780] We fought.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.500] Till Captain Moore was killed, and eighty of his men.
[00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:45.220] When a bombshell shot our ship on fire, we were forced to surrender then.
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.980] And then, next to Newgate, I was bound down in iron chain.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.980] For the robbing of good merchant ship down on that sand.
[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:15.240] And the
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.240] Spanish man.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.240] It was liquor and bad company that made a wreck of me.
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.200] Now you'll beware of my sad fate and the curse on piracy.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.720] Well, that's something for you to get on a record for.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.720] Do you remember who sang that song to you first?
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.720] I remember the singer who sang that song to me.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.720] His name was Johnny Miller.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.720] He was an engineer on a steamboat.
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.720] When was that?
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:46.720] That happened in 18 and 88.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.720] Was he a steamboat sailor?
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.720] He was just a sailor, you know, and before.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.720] But he went steamboating and he learned to be an engineer.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.720] Was he the man that brought it to Newgate?
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.120] Yes.
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.120] And he brought it to this country, you think?
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.120] He brought the song to this country?
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.120] Yes.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.120] I couldn't tell you that.
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.120] You heard it very often.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.120] I heard it from him, that's all.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.120] Did you hear it from anybody else?
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.120] No, never did, no.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.120] Did you learn it from him?
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.120] He learned it, I learned it from him.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.120] Did he write the words down or how?
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.120] No, he never wrote the words down, but he sung it a couple of times and I learned it
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.120] all.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.120] You learned the whole song in two years?
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.120] Yes, and I learned it, you see.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.120] Is it a true song?
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.120] Well, it must be true, because they done that work in those days, you know that, see.
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.120] It's funny, it's funny.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.120] It's funny, it's funny.
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.120] It's funny, it's funny.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:25.120] It's supposed to be a true song.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.780] It's got to be a true song.
[00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.720] They done that in those days, you know.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.640] How did we get these niggers over here?
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.640] Well, we brought them, didn't we?
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.640] Why?
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.640] Well, they brought them over.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.640] What do you think?
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.640] Was it a bad thing or a good thing?
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.640] What's that?
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.640] Was it a bad thing that we brought them, you think?
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.640] No, I don't think so.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.080] What's that?
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:55.560] it was, I don't know why it would be, they had to have them in Cuba, you see, for their
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:02.760] cotton fields and rice and coffee fields there. And they were slaves when they bought them
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.260] there, you know, they were bought and sold. And then they began to buy them over in our
[00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.600] country, you see, over in America, in the southern part of America. And they planted
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.040] them all through the southern states.
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.660] What do you think of Negroes?
[00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.380] Well, I ain't got nothing against a Negro. They were brought here, they were put in
[00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:25.340] their fault. They were captured and brought here. I don't think there's anything that
[00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.680] ought to be wrong about that. If he was brought here and he was taken here to Germany and
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.540] landed there and couldn't get away, well, they can't blame you, can they?
