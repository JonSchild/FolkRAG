[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200] All right.
[00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:10.780] We have wandered in the shadows of the pines, my love and I,
[00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.000] as the wind was blowing freshly from the sea.
[00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:24.140] But a sudden, fitful darkness stole across the summer sky,
[00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.980] and a shadow came between my love and me.
[00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.040] Some hasty words were spoken and almost unaware,
[00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.800] hasty answers to unthinking anger led.
[00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.380] All our heartsick, bitter longing and our weeping and our prayers
[00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:55.360] near can make those faults and cruel words unsaid.
[00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.180] Come back to me, sweet.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.280] Heart that loved me as before.
[00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.620] Back, back to me, sweet.
[00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.500] Heart that leave me nevermore.
[00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:22.340] Thus in life's dark pathway the sun no longer shines.
[00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.980] Come love and meet me in the shadows of the pines.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:40.340] You took the ring I gave you, nor you cast a glance at me,
[00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:47.240] as you held a jewel trinket in your hand.
[00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:55.360] And then you turned and tossed it in the waters of the sea,
[00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.740] where the waves were splashing idly.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.460] And then you turned and tossed it in the waters of the sea,
[00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.360] where the waves were splashing idly.
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.160] You went your way unheeding the tears I could not hide.
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.860] You went your way and not a word was said.
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:22.720] And my stubborn heart was breaking underneath its mask of pride.
[00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.660] And the pine tree sobbed in pity overhead.
[00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.520] Thank you.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.060] Come back to me, sweet.
[00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.140] Heart that loved me as before.
[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.600] Back, back to me, sweet.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.300] Heart that leave me nevermore.
[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:56.660] Thus in life's dark pathway the sun no longer shines.
[00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.140] Come love and meet me in the shadows of the pines.
[00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.840] You took the ring I gave you, nor you cast a glance at me,
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.360] as you held a jewel trinket in the shadows of the pines.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.860] You took the ring I gave you, not a word was said.
[00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:00.260] You took the ring I gave you, not a word was said.
[00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.580] You took the ring I gave you, not a word was said.
[00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:13.980] I awake from bitter dreaming, but to call aloud your name.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.860] I sleep again to dream of you once more.
[00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.360] All my stubborn pride has left me.
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.000] I'll admit I was to blame.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.720] Forgive me.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.880] Love me dear and love me as before.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:42.660] But our future is overshadowed with the darkness of despair.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.780] In the sky of life, love's sun no longer shines.
[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:57.300] But I'd give this whole world gladly once again to meet you there.
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:03.480] Reunited in the shadows of the vine.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:12.460] Come back to me sweetheart and love me as before.
[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:21.720] Back, back to me sweetheart and leave me nevermore.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.100] Thus in life's dark pathway.
[00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:27.280] Thus I'll be.
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.940] The sun no longer shines.
[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:39.180] Come love and meet me in the shadows of the vine.
