[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000] Review with Wesley A.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:31.480] Well, we're testing this to see if the noise of the truck is too much for this tape recorder.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.520] I don't know about all of that.
[00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.760] Well, you just want me to come in from the middle of it?
[00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.280] Do you got part of it?
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.600] No.
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.080] Okay.
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.000] Well, Ollie, back in the late 30s, a poke fincher from Kingston come over here,
[00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.620] and he got me an offering to help him buy cattle.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.040] And we bought up about 214 heads.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.180] It was about two weeks of getting everything lined up,
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.100] and we started to outfitting with them.
[00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:25.560] And we got over the way and sold one of his brother's boy 14 heads,
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.100] and that left us 200 heads.
[00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.740] And we lost eight heads on the drive down in a canyon.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.080] And he come back later and got those.
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.220] And we got way back about 40 miles this side of Alpena.
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:53.460] Yeah, we had a horseback, and it was 80 miles to Alpena from where we left our place here on Friday's grief.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.020] And we drove them cattle to his place and stopped and stayed two days and let them rest,
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.040] and he butchered one.
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.840] And then we took them on.
[00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:16.540] And we was always about 30 days rounding them up and getting them over there and getting back home.
[00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.920] And I got $2 a day for me and the horse.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.980] And we was out all about 40 miles this side of Alpena,
[00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.920] and he rode up to a house and he said,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.880] Lady, I need something.
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.580] I need something to eat for seven men.
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.360] And he said, We need to be moving on pretty quick.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.260] And he said, Eggs and bacon and cornbread would be good.
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.280] And she said, Uncle Polk, my husband's gone.
[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.640] And he said, Well, lady, he didn't take the cook stove, did he?
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.060] And she said, No, he didn't take it.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.100] He said, You get down, and I'll fix you something to eat.
[00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.440] And we ate, and then we started on.
[00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:01.860] Of course, we had to count.
[00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.720] Every once in a while on the road and herd them cattle.
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.740] And they weren't very good fences then.
[00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.140] Part of the bunch had set up midnight,
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.600] and the rest would go to bed then at midnight,
[00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.540] and they were supposed to take them over until daylight,
[00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.840] and then we'd head out about daylight with them.
[00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.700] We got to Alpena.
[00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.760] And right up north of Alpena, we drove them up a hill,
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.860] and we got to Alpena.
[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.620] We put down on top of the hill and put them in a big pasture.
[00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.340] A fella by the name of Jim Ward bought them off of Mr. Fancher,
[00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.500] and then we started back home.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.600] Squiggy, he got them all lined up, got his check,
[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.520] and we started home, and that was the end of the story.
[00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.960] Well, I'm gonna start to tell this part of the story.
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.520] I missed a little of it.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.460] We was out to the other side of Red Star,
[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.520] and they took off down that holler.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.020] two miles outside of Red Star.
[00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:10.020] And so one of the folks' boys, he was 81 years old,
[00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.020] the old man was, and he couldn't hear good.
[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:18.020] And he couldn't, he'd have to sit in the saddle
[00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.520] and he couldn't turn his head.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.020] And the old cow had a bell on,
[00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.020] and he was just going along the road hollering.
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.520] And Sam said,
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.520] you go on, Paul, it won't never stop with that old cow.
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.520] And I said, well, I'll go on then.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.520] I took after him on my little horse,
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.520] and about two miles around the road where I caught him,
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.520] I rode up the side of him, and I said,
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.520] Uncle Pope, we've lost them cattle,
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.520] and we've got to get down in there and try to get them out.
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.520] And Sam said, for you to go out there
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.520] and put that cow in that log barn,
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.520] said you'd know where the log barn was,
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.520] and you stay there with her,
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.520] and we'll go out there.
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.520] And we'll go out there and get them out.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.520] Uncle Pope said, no, he said, I know more about them,
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.520] get them out of there and Sam does.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.520] And we tied the cow up all right in the stall,
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.520] and he went back with me,
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.520] and we got them things out, all but eight head,
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.520] and they come back later and gone.
