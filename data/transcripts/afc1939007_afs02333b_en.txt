[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.720] A.F.S. Recording Number 2333, Side B.
[00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:19.920] Way out in California, a happy driving day.
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:28.140] We're planning for the Christmas, not very far away.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.160] They had a little daughter, a sweet and good little child.
[00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:45.100] And all the folks are beautiful, a merry and sparkly smile.
[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:54.740] She left her home one morning for school at Bobby.
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.220] And no one dreamt that danger.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.320] But come to her that day.
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:11.260] But a miserable villain with a heart of stone.
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.620] Who took little Mary away from home.
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.940] And then we caught the caller.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.940] John Hickman was their man.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.400] They brought him back to justice.
[00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.760] His final trial to stand.
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.740] Now this song is a warning to parents far and dear.
[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:53.940] We cannot guard too closely the ones we love so dear.
[00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.940] Music
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:11.600] These two ballads, The Girl in the Blue Velvet Band and The Murder of Marian Parker,
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:21.120] were sung by Alan Pope of St. Ignace, Michigan, on September 11, 1938, for the Library Congress.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.320] How old are you, Mr. Pope?
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.320] Twenty.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.320] And where did you learn the song?
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.320] Well, I learned that one from my sister in the Blue Velvet Band.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.320] I learned it from my sister in the Blue Velvet Band.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.320] That was the first time I learned the song.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.320] I learned it from my sister when they were young.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.320] I learned it from my sister when they were young.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.580] I learned it from a friend of mine.
