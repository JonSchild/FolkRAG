[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.620] Okay, shoot.
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.620] A hula boo, and a hula boo.
[00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.000] A hula boo, and a hula boo.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.340] Oh, was you drunk?
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.280] Oh, was you blind?
[00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.280] Oh, Clarence McFadden, he wanted the waltz.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.680] But his feet were not jointed that way.
[00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.880] He went up to a professor and stated his case
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.680] and said that he was willing to pay.
[00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.360] The professor looked down with a lob at his feet
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.220] and taxed on an extra fiver to his usual pay
[00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.440] for learning McFadden to waltz.
[00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.080] Oh, it's one, two, and three.
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.880] Clarence, like me, you're quite a furry, but you got your faults.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.080] You left foot is lazy while your right foot is crazy.
[00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.640] But don't be a nazy.
[00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.800] We'll learn you to waltz.
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.480] He took him out before the whole class
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.700] and showed him the step once to twice.
[00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.720] So Patty struck out with a will,
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.820] not looking from behind or before.
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.440] And he fell on his nose and chewed all the wax in the floor.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.560] Oh, it's one, two, and three.
[00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.660] Clarence, like me, you're quite a furry, but you got your faults.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.460] You left foot is lazy while your right foot is crazy.
[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.460] But don't be a nazy.
[00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.040] We'll learn you to waltz.
[00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.880] So Patty went to a dance one night.
[00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.700] He went up to a girl and asked her to dance.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.540] He took her out and hurled her out into line.
[00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.420] He stood up and said,
[00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.600] I'll dance.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.640] I'll dance.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.840] He stood up and said, I'll dance.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.920] He stood up and said, I'll dance.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.980] He stood up and said, I'll dance.
[00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.920] He stepped on her toes and bumped on her nose.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.920] And sure, the poor girl was laid up for a week for learning.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.920] But the waltz, her paddy went out one night to paint the town a bright red.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.920] He spent all his money and came back broke.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.920] And lay down and dreamt that he was waltzing and he kicked the dashboard off the bed.
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.920] Oh, it's one, two, three.
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.920] Fellas like me are quite a fairy, but you got your faults.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.920] Your left foot is lazy while your right foot is crazy.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.920] But don't be a nazy, we'll learn you to waltz.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.920] Tell us your name.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.920] Huh?
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:47.920] Put your name on it.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.920] What?
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.920] Put your name down there. Put your name down there.
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.920] No, wait a minute. I forgot about that.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:57.920] Jack?
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.920] Put your name down there.
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:59.920] What?
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:00.920] Put your name down there.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:01.920] Hey, hey, hey, water.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.920] Oh, the water.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.920] Come on, come on.
