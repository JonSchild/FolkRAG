[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:29.980] Thank you.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:59.980] Thank you.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:29.980] Thank you.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.060] And there's another thing I always try to raise my kids.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.960] I was taught, and I try to raise my kids,
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.460] your word amount has got to be worth more than money.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.640] If your word amount is worth more than money,
[00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.680] no matter what you say to somebody, they'll believe you.
[00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.100] Credit's no object.
[00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.560] I'm 48 years old, right?
[00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.180] I just got a credit card last month.
[00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.620] The bank comes in and goes,
[00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.540] Andy, we're going to siticize you.
[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.500] Let's get you a credit card.
[00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.560] He goes, I don't need no credit card.
[00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.120] If I lose, I've got to report it.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.720] He goes, if I can't buy it, I don't want it.
[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.140] He goes, no, no, you go on vacation.
[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.200] You need this and that.
[00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:09.880] I go, sign over here.
[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:10.840] So I sign my name on it.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:11.800] He says, I'll get you a credit card.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.120] I mean, no application.
[00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.140] I mean, I have salesmen.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.460] He says, Anthony, I'm going to ship you some stuff.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.020] Put it on the market.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.700] Don't even send a bill.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.740] Just sign that you got it and this and that,
[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:22.860] and I'll mail you a bill later.
[00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.120] Two months later, Anthony, can you send us a check?
[00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.400] Yeah, sure, I'll send you a check.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.040] I mean, a lot of people in Belgium can't do that today.
[00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.880] So you mean that for 48 years, you didn't have a credit card?
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.840] You didn't need it?
[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.460] Well, I just never, if I couldn't buy it, I wouldn't buy it.
[00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.760] If I couldn't afford it, I wouldn't buy it.
[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.760] I mean, that's the way.
[00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.020] And people, they go out and charge a credit card to the guilt.
[00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.520] I mean, they're living on paper.
[00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.440] I mean, it's the way you want to live your life.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.980] I mean, I'm not out to impress anybody.
[00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.840] I mean, I love my cars.
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.800] I mean, I have some beautiful cars.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.200] But you were saying, I interrupted you about that.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.740] You may have to go to the store.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.780] Oh, yeah, okay.
[00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.200] You're getting off subject again.
[00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.980] The store was very, very New York-y.
[00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.160] You know, it was New York style.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.100] We used to, no packaged foods, everything cut to order.
[00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.640] You want a steak thin, you cut a steak thin.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.940] You want a steak thick, you cut it thick.
[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.740] You want it aged, you get it aged.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.580] You want the mochito thin, you get it thin.
[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.700] You want it thick, we cut it thin.
[00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:16.800] You want prosciutto thick.
[00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.660] Whatever you wanted, that's the way it was cut, to order.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.980] And that's what made our store special.
[00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.000] And then the way we got around people and talked
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.140] and got friendly with people.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.640] I mean, you can't make 100% of people happy,
[00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.320] but the way our atmosphere in the store is,
[00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:36.960] it's different than other stores.
[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:38.520] It's been like that.
[00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.840] I mean, sometimes you get so personal with people,
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.180] they're telling you your private lives.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.840] I mean, we don't want to know all that, but, you know.
[00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.740] I mean, just that way, I mean, people,
[00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.920] we find it out now that even your closest friends,
[00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:49.880] you can't even trust them here
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.900] because they make a bill and you don't see them no more.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.480] And, you know, the best way to remain friends is no credit.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:56.040] You know what I mean?
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.100] You know what I mean?
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.160] You know what I mean?
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.220] You know what I mean?
[00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.260] You know what I mean?
[00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.380] You know what I mean?
[00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.400] You know what I mean?
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.720] Once you give credit, you lose a friend, you know.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.920] So we do very, very little credit now.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.800] And...
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.700] Oh, yeah, I mean, we used to...
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.560] I mean, and then business every year
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.760] is getting tougher and tougher.
[00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.320] Overhead is much higher.
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.800] I mean, it's just...
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.720] But anyway, we'll get off that.
[00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.160] So we just kept it this way,
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.580] and we just outgrew the store again.
[00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.520] So we knocked down the wall,
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.940] and we moved back 13 more feet.
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.080] We tore it down.
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.380] We had to put new meat cases up.
[00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.940] And it's now...
[00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.880] I mean, we come in here,
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.560] and there'll be meat stacked up to the ceiling.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.000] And I used to run the meat department,
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.520] the whole store by myself.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.420] I mean, a 14-foot deli,
[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.040] a 24-foot meat counter.
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.520] I mean, on Saturdays,
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.400] when I came to work at 7 Door,
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.480] there'd be people in front of the door
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.700] waiting to get in to beat the crowds.
[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.780] And, I mean, I used to work until 9 o'clock at night
[00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:51.920] breaking down lamb.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.360] My lamb is big here.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.120] Oh, I saw a lot of lamb here.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.100] I mean,
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.540] my lamb,
[00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.400] my veal,
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.000] my steaks.
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.980] I mean,
[00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:04.660] I saw a lot of...
[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.540] My father,
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.300] once again,
[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.000] when he used to meet,
[00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.660] he'd tell the butcher,
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.320] he used to bring the bologna.
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.380] Hey, bring me a shoulder cloth.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.820] I mean, you know,
[00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:14.980] he said, no, you don't cut like that.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.740] Okay, we start cutting like that.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.960] No school,
[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.920] just on-the-job training.
[00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:20.220] People go to college,
[00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.900] they get off of college,
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:21.460] they go to work,
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:22.520] they have to learn how to work again.
[00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.200] You get a professional basketball player,
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.080] works with,
[00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.340] plays college ball,
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.960] goes to pro,
[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.900] he has to learn how to play basketball
[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:30.440] all over again.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.100] That's the way we were.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.200] We were just on-the-job training.
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.220] We just did it our way.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.000] Matter of fact,
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.180] we have three, four cuts of meat
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.760] in our showcase
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:37.880] that we named it ourselves.
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.120] California steak.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.860] You don't find that anywhere.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.220] I named it that steak.
[00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:42.940] It's a chunk of meat
[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:43.440] that we cut.
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.460] We make roast steak,
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.200] stew,
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.200] and ground meat out of it.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.060] And you buy it for $1.69 a pound.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:49.920] You get the best steak.
[00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:50.760] You get the best roast.
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:51.600] You get the best stew
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.240] and your best grass.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.160] Ground meat is all cut,
[00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.500] wrapped individually with a customer.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.200] You go home,
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.860] they tinkle pink.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:57.880] What are the other two cuts
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:58.760] of meat that you...
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.520] Our lamb is very good.
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:01.240] Our veal is good.
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.320] We don't buy the real
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.020] Cabrini veal
[00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.700] because we don't have
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.440] that kind of trade.
[00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.820] We do just keep it simple.
[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:10.960] We don't want to get too fancy,
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.620] too modern.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:12.920] Then we have the everyday market.
[00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:13.700] We don't want to do that.
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.820] We want to keep it simple.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.000] Keep it,
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.300] you know,
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.740] keep it macrame clean.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:19.400] Keep it clean.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.480] Our kitchen is a macrame.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.300] We have a crew
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.580] that cleans our kitchen every day.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.300] Our stock rooms
[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.080] are always kept clean.
[00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.640] They go away from the walls.
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:28.560] Always swept up.
[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:29.560] You know,
[00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.740] we have a rodent pest control
[00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:31.740] like everybody else does.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:32.360] Once a month,
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:32.940] comes in.
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:36.100] No,
[00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.800] it's just the way
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.580] it has to be.
[00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:38.420] You know,
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:38.840] I mean,
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.900] you walk into a store
[00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:40.200] that's filled.
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.940] You go into a restaurant
[00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.240] and it smells greasy.
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.040] You're going to go there again
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.560] and you don't do that.
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:43.820] No.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.880] You want to come in
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:45.780] and smell sauce cooking
[00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:46.300] on the stove
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.480] or roast in the oven
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.040] or sausage being fried
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.000] for making sausage sandwich.
[00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:50.360] That's when,
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:50.840] ooh,
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.740] what are you guys cooking?
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.100] You know,
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:53.620] I mean...
[00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.040] How long has Ed been
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.980] part of the store?
[00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:56.500] Always.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.360] Always.
[00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.020] We always cook.
[00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.120] When we started working here,
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:00.640] we never went out
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:00.740] and said,
[00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:00.880] hey,
[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:01.540] go to McDonald's,
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.340] get a couple hamburgers.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.020] We cook here.
[00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:03.960] We work here.
[00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:07.140] And...
[00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.880] I saw that you do food
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.000] in your employees too.
[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:10.480] Yeah,
[00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:11.900] we feed a lunch here.
[00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:12.600] You know,
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:13.700] we cook here.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:14.200] You know,
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.120] on Christmas time,
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:17.860] Christmas time,
[00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:18.360] we work,
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:19.000] I mean,
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:19.700] like everybody else,
[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:20.140] very hard.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.480] It's a very long month.
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:22.020] I mean,
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.000] it's a long month Christmas.
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.300] You work hard catering.
[00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:25.300] I do a lot of catering.
[00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.000] My own way,
[00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:28.120] we cook stuffed shells.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.140] We make our own crepes
[00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:29.880] for the cannolis,
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:30.320] I mean,
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.440] for the cannelloni.
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:33.200] We make lasagna.
[00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:33.740] We make,
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:33.980] you know,
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.340] nothing out of the can.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.760] We make everything fresh.
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.280] If you want to buy,
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.200] you want to buy
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.760] everyday stuff,
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:43.500] then you go on the shelf
[00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:43.940] and get their
[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:44.940] blankety-blank label,
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:45.800] this label here,
[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:46.140] and say,
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:46.580] okay,
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.380] I got this on me.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.060] They come day one,
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:48.540] you know you're getting
[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:49.080] something special.
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:50.980] People go out of the way.
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:52.860] Summertime is my best time
[00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:53.820] because people get company.
[00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:55.600] They eat their everyday food
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.080] for themselves.
[00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:56.860] But when they get company,
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.440] they got to go high roll.
[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.340] When they have walk-in company,
[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.360] they don't have to come day one
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.060] because I want the best.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:03.740] They got to come day one
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:04.360] and get the best.
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.720] They got the best pasta.
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:08.800] They got to get the best sauce.
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:09.900] They got to get the best vegetables.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.080] They got the white mushrooms.
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:12.260] They got to make sure
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:12.900] everything's done.
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.160] And like I said,
[00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:14.660] Christmas time,
[00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:15.460] when we're working hard,
[00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:17.120] I get a whole lamb quartered,
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:17.460] stick it,
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:18.240] put it on a pan,
[00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:19.380] season it the night before,
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.080] and I bake it in the oven.
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:20.520] We stop.
[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:21.580] No dishes,
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.080] no nothing.
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.060] Just get the lamb,
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:23.720] put it on the block,
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.040] cover it,
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.140] and I eat it off the block.
[00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:27.100] Bottle of wine.
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:28.980] Then just dump everything
[00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:29.620] in a trash can,
[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:30.260] go back to work,
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:30.620] let's go.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.540] Who makes the sausages?
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.160] We all take turns
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:36.780] making sausage.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:37.560] We make sausage
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:38.580] about five times a week.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:39.540] Really?
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:40.640] Oh yeah.
[00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:41.320] We made it today.
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:42.360] He's making it right.
[00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:42.840] He just finished.
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:43.320] While we were in here,
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:43.860] he was making sausage
[00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:44.360] over there already.
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.700] We make it every other day,
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:47.040] sausage.
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.360] What are the steps
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.200] involved in doing that?
[00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.260] You use a good pork butt,
[00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:51.140] right seasoning,
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.660] hang for a day
[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:54.620] so it drains,
[00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:55.240] put wine.
[00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:56.960] You put wine?
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:57.720] Oh sure.
[00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:58.880] Put wine.
[00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:00.820] Whatever seasoning you like.
[00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:01.900] We make it with fennel,
[00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:02.460] we make it hot,
[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:03.400] we make it regular seasoning.
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:04.260] We make it with
[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:04.940] breakfast sausage.
[00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:07.040] Did you bring the camera up?
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.440] I don't have it today.
[00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:09.140] I have it.
[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:10.860] Is it still working?
[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.140] No, that's all done.
[00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.180] Well, Ken will be here tomorrow.
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:13.900] Yeah.
[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:16.660] But we find,
[00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:18.540] I ain't kidding,
[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:19.340] this is no joke,
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.440] we find people
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.160] who work in the
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:21.980] big chain markets
[00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:22.840] and other markets
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:23.540] come here and buy
[00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:24.120] their stuff here.
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:24.460] Mm-hmm.
[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.020] You know, people work for
[00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:27.240] Vine.
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:27.980] They come with their tags
[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:28.720] and they take it off.
[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:28.900] It goes,
[00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:29.700] oh, how was work today?
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:30.660] Oh, no.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.440] We joke with them,
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:32.660] you know,
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.380] we tease them
[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.140] and we tell our customers off
[00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:35.780] and they come behind
[00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:36.120] the counter,
[00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:37.880] they tune on the stuff here
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.200] and, you know,
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.080] and, you know,
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:40.740] it's just that
[00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.740] when you mention the word A1,
[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:43.900] everybody knows A1,
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:44.340] you know,
[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:45.300] and when everybody
[00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:45.860] wants to meet,
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:46.580] they know something
[00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:47.180] about A1
[00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:48.740] and a lot has to do
[00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:49.240] with my father.
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.960] My father is one person,
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.040] an enemy,
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.080] friend,
[00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:56.220] friend,
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:56.940] foul,
[00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:57.920] whatever it is,
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:58.720] when you mention
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.540] Frank Matera,
[00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:00.380] which is my father,
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:01.820] you got to take your hat
[00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:02.760] off to a man like that
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.080] because this man here,
[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:05.000] I mean,
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.000] you want to talk to a man
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.180] and he won't
[00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:07.780] chew your ear off
[00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:08.300] but he'll give you
[00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:09.640] some old traditions
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:10.500] that you won't believe.
[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:10.820] I mean,
[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.480] he's one of the old time,
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.900] work hard,
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:17.840] many hours.
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:18.100] I mean,
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:18.740] he used to come home
[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:19.760] with his hands bleeding
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:20.460] from the crack,
[00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.400] from the frost in the ice.
[00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:23.080] His hands would just
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:23.580] be cracked
[00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:25.700] from just bleeding.
[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:26.840] Nosebleeds
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:27.460] because it was so cold.
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:28.280] You'd get up at 4 o'clock
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:28.520] in the morning,
[00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:29.580] he showers way out
[00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:30.060] of the garage
[00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.000] and he still drives
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:32.940] a 65 Buick.
[00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:36.480] He's the old fashioned type
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.080] but as a person,
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.640] you cannot find
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:40.740] a man with a charisma
[00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:41.680] like this man's got.
[00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:42.360] And this guy,
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:42.520] I mean,
[00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:43.100] he's natural.
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:43.880] He don't even act it.
[00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:44.160] I mean,
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:45.420] he's very low key
[00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:46.660] but the way he presents himself,
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:46.940] I mean,
[00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:48.140] you just can't help
[00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:48.620] loving him.
[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:48.860] I mean,
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:49.440] that's what he is.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:50.160] I mean,
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:50.780] he went to the hospital
[00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:51.200] and the nurses,
[00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:51.600] they didn't want
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.140] to leave the room.
[00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:52.400] I mean,
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.540] I mean,
[00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:55.960] he was crazy.
[00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:56.340] He was crazy.
[00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:56.780] He was crazy.
[00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:57.480] He was crazy.
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:58.100] Yeah.
[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.940] How did he pick San Pedro
[00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:02.320] of all of California?
[00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:02.740] Well,
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.260] because he had an aunt,
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:04.820] he had a sister
[00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:05.420] that lived out here.
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:06.740] So he came to visit his sister
[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:07.560] and when he came to California
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:08.800] he saw the California weather.
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:09.480] He went crazy.
[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:10.980] And he likes,
[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:12.600] he loves the heat.
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:13.080] No,
[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:13.560] I mean,
[00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:14.380] not that he loves the heat
[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:15.280] but he likes warm weather.
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:16.740] When he came out here
[00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:17.300] and he saw the sunshine,
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.280] he went fishing one day
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:19.040] on the fishing fleet.
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.480] We have a big fishing fleet
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:20.960] until we do,
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.100] we supply 11 men
[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.100] three meals a day
[00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.500] for 680 watt catch fish.
[00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:25.760] We,
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:26.080] for about,
[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:26.960] we buy them with all the food,
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:27.960] take the stuff on the boat,
[00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.260] wrap each other's things up,
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:30.500] send it down to the boat.
[00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:32.800] Yeah,
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:33.080] we,
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.440] we supply some of the best restaurants
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.440] in San Pedro here.
[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:37.580] Grandhouse,
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:38.980] Papadakis,
[00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.940] we have McKenna's Creek
[00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:42.700] in Long Beach.
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.240] We have a lot of the
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.120] Lampost pizzas.
[00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:47.200] They can buy,
[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:48.100] they can go to the L.A. market
[00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:49.160] and buy the chopped lettuce.
[00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:50.080] And when you go to the salad bar,
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:51.460] when you buy the salad bar,
[00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:52.520] you buy the chopped lettuce.
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.740] They buy it in a 10 pound bag
[00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:54.460] at the L.A. market.
[00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:54.800] They put the,
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:55.640] no, no,
[00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:55.880] they don't want it.
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:56.320] They don't want that.
[00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.420] They want A1 special chopped lettuce
[00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.460] with no preservatives,
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.840] made fresh every day
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.000] so they can keep it
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:02.540] three, four days.
[00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:03.500] It doesn't go wilt on them.
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:04.320] So,
[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.040] and they will pay the 50 cents more
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:06.300] because,
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.960] but they want A1's lettuce.
[00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:09.560] That's the kind of
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.940] business I got here.
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:11.860] I mean,
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:12.260] like I said,
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.240] if I put something else in there,
[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:13.500] okay,
[00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:14.500] A1's going to go for sale,
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.200] put a,
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:15.620] just a,
[00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:17.120] a regular person
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:17.460] to come here
[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:18.120] and run this business,
[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:19.140] never make it.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.820] That's why I'm really pushing hard
[00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:22.640] for the man who's
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.680] at the register now
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:24.600] and my boy to take over
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.020] because,
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:27.540] this business here
[00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.560] is my dad's heart.
[00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:30.140] You know,
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:30.960] if this thing went down,
[00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:31.500] it would,
[00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:32.400] it would bury him.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:32.740] You know,
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:33.200] I mean,
[00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:34.820] he's worked hard all his life
[00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.520] and I try hard.
[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:36.720] I mean,
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.500] we don't run it like he did
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.480] many years.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:39.720] I mean,
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.780] I've had my time off.
[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:42.520] We work very hard
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:42.820] but we,
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:43.840] between three years
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.980] we take our days off now.
[00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:45.920] We got to set it,
[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:46.920] set it down right now
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:47.140] but,
[00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:48.700] for him,
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.340] he used to work
[00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:50.360] seven days a week,
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.480] 80 hours a week,
[00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:52.100] seven,
[00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:52.380] you know,
[00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:53.040] just constantly.
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.740] But that's what he loved
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:55.000] to do.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.120] What did your mother
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:56.840] love you so much?
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:57.120] No.
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:57.560] No.
[00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:00.260] I don't say this is true
[00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:01.000] in every factor
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:01.420] but,
[00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:03.020] keeping family out of,
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.240] it's very hard
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.020] to work with family.
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.280] What I had to put up
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:07.860] with my father,
[00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:08.720] no employee would have
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.180] put up with.
[00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.500] It's hard to work
[00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:11.440] for your own flesh and blood
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.380] because you got to take more lip,
[00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.140] you got to take more,
[00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:15.700] you're expected to do more
[00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:16.380] because your blood
[00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.040] and if you get involved
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:18.940] with wife and husband,
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.500] you got to live with a day,
[00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:21.540] you got to live with a night,
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:22.240] you'll argue,
[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:22.720] you go home,
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:23.220] before you know it,
[00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:23.700] you're divorced.
[00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:23.880] I was,
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:24.980] I was,
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.100] I was married 15 years.
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:26.560] My,
[00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.000] my job was not because
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.040] of the cause of my divorce
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.100] but my wife never knew
[00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:31.740] about the business.
[00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:32.640] I mean,
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:33.080] she didn't even know
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:33.880] what I took home a week
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.260] but she was well provided of
[00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:36.220] but,
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.840] when I came home,
[00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:39.100] that was it.
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:40.040] She might help me
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:40.400] with the bills
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:40.980] once in a while
[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:42.080] but we went on
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:42.600] into the business
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.280] during the day
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.200] or during the week.
[00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:45.560] It was not a concern
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:46.380] of her.
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.060] It was not great on home.
[00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:48.820] We ate at the table.
[00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:49.760] We didn't talk about business.
[00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:50.580] Business was business.
[00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:51.200] We went home
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:51.900] and that was the home.
[00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.160] I raised the kids
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.400] and this and that.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:55.240] But,
[00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:56.840] I find a lot of people
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:57.360] who go in business
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.000] with their family,
[00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.060] with their husband and wife,
[00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:00.520] it's very hard.
[00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:01.520] Very hard.
[00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:02.160] Not because,
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:03.320] just that you're
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:03.980] on each other's throat
[00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:04.560] and you can talk,
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:05.620] you talk more different
[00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:06.000] than you do
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.900] to your own flesh and blood
[00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:08.980] or your mate
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:09.520] than you do
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:10.280] to employees.
[00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:12.340] And it doesn't work out
[00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:12.740] sometimes.
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.340] It does on certain occasions
[00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:15.200] but it's very hard
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.260] to work with,
[00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:17.760] with spouses
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:18.720] in business.
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:19.440] Very hard.
[00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:20.240] Unless,
[00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:21.140] with my,
[00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:21.880] with my case,
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:22.560] when I was in business
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.020] with my partner
[00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:23.820] for 20 years,
[00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:24.880] we never got
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:25.680] involved with each other
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:26.480] as part of the business.
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:27.560] He did his part
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:28.040] of the business.
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:29.780] I did my part
[00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:30.240] of the business.
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:31.440] We each took care of,
[00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:32.820] we each had to take care
[00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:33.420] of our own part
[00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:34.000] of our business.
[00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:35.480] And it worked out.
[00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:36.920] Now this man here,
[00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:37.720] Emilio Angelo here,
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:38.460] he's,
[00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.000] he's worked very hard
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.960] and he sees,
[00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:43.440] he's worked very hard
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:43.940] in this business
[00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:44.800] and he's coming
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:45.520] into this here.
[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:49.180] Yeah.
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:51.940] I'm always on his case
[00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:52.900] when I spot smoking.
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:54.500] But,
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:55.160] I don't know,
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:56.000] like I said,
[00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:56.720] I get off track,
[00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:57.520] I can go on and on.
[00:14:58.420 --> 00:14:59.260] I'm just wondering,
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:00.900] we're talking about

[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.120] what the store is.
[00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:05.180] Could we walk down
[00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:05.880] the aisle with you
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:06.740] and just talk to you
[00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:07.140] about what,

[00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:08.600] in the store?
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:09.160] Can we do that?
[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:09.740] Yeah,
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:10.100] that's,
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.060] we have the regular
[00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:11.760] common food,
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:11.980] you know,
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:12.740] we have the regular
[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:14.200] everyday.

[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:17.720] we have this here,
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:18.480] this is the produce,
[00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:19.380] we have a produce list.

[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:21.780] to my son right now.

[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:22.540] he's,

[00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:24.620] we have to buy.
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:25.320] We have every item
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:25.680] you can buy
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:26.440] in a produce market.
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:26.860] And,
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.140] then we have orders
[00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:28.740] for tomorrow.
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.280] Match what they say,
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.140] we buy for every day,
[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:31.720] we buy every day
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:32.160] for the market.
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:37.240] Tell me about
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:37.900] what's out here
[00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:38.360] in this room.
[00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:40.300] This is our regular
[00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:40.640] general,
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:41.640] this is our regular
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:42.320] sandwich area.
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.120] This is where we make
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:44.800] all our sandwiches.
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:45.580] We have one lady
[00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:45.980] who takes care
[00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:46.620] of the whole kitchen.
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:48.600] It comes to a point now
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.400] where it takes two people
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.180] to take care of the kitchen
[00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:51.680] because she takes care
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:52.480] of all making it,
[00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:53.120] the sauce,
[00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:54.340] making the sandwiches,
[00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:55.500] keeping the kitchen clean,
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:56.960] keeping the slicer clean,
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:57.960] keeping the floor clean,
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:15:59.920] keeping the stove clean.
[00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:00.620] We have a hood
[00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:01.200] that takes care
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.380] of all the sauce cooking.
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:02.900] We make sauce
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:03.600] three times a week.
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:05.820] Is she a Vitamian
[00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:06.280] in the background?
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:08.900] She is no,
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.140] she is from Argentina.
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:11.920] She has no relation.
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:12.900] She's just somebody
[00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:13.580] who's worked here
[00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:14.300] for many years.
[00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:15.260] And,
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:19.120] she ventured on,
[00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:20.220] she wanted to advance
[00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:20.880] and go someplace else.
[00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:21.360] She went there
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:21.860] about two months
[00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:22.340] and she's in Niagara.
[00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:23.680] I got to come back
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:24.060] day one.
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.260] She gave me my job back.
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:25.460] I go,
[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:25.840] yeah, sure.
[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:26.880] So I give her a job back.
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.600] Tell me about these drawings.
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:29.700] These are all people
[00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:30.580] who used to work for me.
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:32.580] That's one of my birds
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:32.900] I lost.
[00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.080] He was Iranian.
[00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:35.940] He used to work for me.
[00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:36.740] Boganish.
[00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:39.040] These are all people
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:39.640] who used to work for me
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:40.420] in my limo business.
[00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:41.240] This is the lady
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:41.620] that left.
[00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:43.780] Don't cry for me.
[00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:45.080] Don't cry for me.
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:46.940] As people laughed
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:47.980] and we put coffins up.
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.140] But who put the crosses
[00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:49.640] on top of us?
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.700] Those are coffins.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:52.460] Those are the,
[00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:52.520] those are the coffins.
[00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:53.100] What do you call it?
[00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:54.360] Those are the tombstones.
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:55.940] People used to work for me.
[00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:56.760] because they do that.
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:57.100] There was a bunch of them
[00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:57.340] over there,
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:57.940] but we had a pain
[00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:58.660] because it was getting
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:16:59.120] kind of bad
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:16:59.840] when you make sauces.
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:00.280] We had a pain
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:00.840] so we had to cover up
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:01.280] three coffins.
[00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:01.780] We had to redo
[00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:02.480] those three coffins.
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:03.140] Does that mean they're dead
[00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:04.120] or they just left the business?
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:05.300] They no longer work there.
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:09.220] I used to have two,
[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:10.500] some guy made a joke.
[00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:11.680] I used to have two guinea pigs.
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:12.540] All you could do,
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.040] I sold them,
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:14.880] they put the coffin up.
[00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:16.600] When I lost my bird,
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.280] they put that up.
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.380] This is my limo business.
[00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:19.740] The car is sold too.
[00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:20.720] This is my limo business.
[00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:20.940] See?
[00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:22.720] This is my limo business.
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:23.960] Auntie, I'm at Merrill Less.
[00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:24.720] I got the phone,
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:25.260] take it in there,
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:25.700] beep, beep.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.800] The phones don't stop ringing.
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.340] Yes, it was $40 an hour.
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:32.060] It was $40.
[00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:32.980] This is my limo business.
[00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:34.240] I used to have four limos.
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:36.460] So I sold my limo.
[00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.580] So that rest in peace.
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:38.460] Yes, that rest in peace.
[00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:39.920] They're foaming off the wall.
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:40.420] Okay.
[00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:41.280] Now what,
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.160] walking into the next section
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.300] where you've got some
[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:45.680] chopping blocks
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:46.400] and a couple of...
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.040] Yeah, this is where we do
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.240] our preparation for the salads
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.400] and we make the salad
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.160] for the restaurants.
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:50.920] So we have a lot
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.420] of dryers to dry the lettuce
[00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:53.580] and then we have a steam table
[00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:54.680] to keep all the hot sauces
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:55.820] and meatball sandwiches there.
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:56.920] We make our sauces there
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:03.520] and we make all the caving trays
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:04.920] and all the...
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.240] And she works generally
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:07.860] in this area.
[00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:08.600] She works here.
[00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:10.520] I mean, she never is done.
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:11.240] I mean, every day.
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.900] She's here six days a week.
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.040] She comes from 8 to 4
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:15.820] and then on Saturday
[00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:16.940] she works from 8 to 2
[00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.600] and she works very hard
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:20.260] at what she does.
[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:21.520] What were these trays
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:22.220] you were talking about?
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:22.800] We do...
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:23.200] That's our trays
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:23.980] we make caving orders.
[00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:25.980] You know, we make trays
[00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:26.780] of cold cuts
[00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.120] and stuff like that.
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:31.600] You see the mark
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:32.080] in the ceiling.
[00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:33.240] That's where we move back.
[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:34.740] This wall was way out there
[00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:36.400] and we just...
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.120] This dedication
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.260] used to go along this way.
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:39.640] Yeah.
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:40.360] See that mark
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:40.820] in the ceiling?
[00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:41.500] Oh, yeah.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:43.100] We cut the wall down.
[00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:44.480] We put the showcase this way.
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:45.400] We put another two shelves
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.520] and we move back 13 feet.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:47.120] Oh, yeah.
[00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:47.600] From there.
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:47.980] Okay.
[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:49.260] Like, see all these rails
[00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.240] on here?
[00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:50.680] Yeah.
[00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:51.660] I mean, you can't see
[00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:52.200] behind the counter.
[00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:52.960] There's so much stuff
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:53.660] hanging from here.
[00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:54.600] But in the summertime
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.380] you can't do that
[00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:56.320] because perishables
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:57.200] and, you know,
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.100] it's not very clean.
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:00.820] Tell me what you have
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:01.280] in the case here.
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.020] We make our own
[00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:03.300] homemade antibacterial.
[00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:03.980] We make our own
[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:04.840] eggplant parmesan
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.580] and we make
[00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.220] marinated eggplant
[00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:09.540] that we make ourselves there.
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.340] We make our own stuffed shells.
[00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.080] Everything from scratch.
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.400] No packaged foods or nothing.
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:18.360] Everything made from scratch.
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:18.960] Lasagna.
[00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:21.500] Stuffed artichokes.
[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.300] We make our own made lobster sauce.
[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:25.260] This is the stuff that the lady does?
[00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:25.460] Yeah.
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:26.040] We all, you know,
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.940] we chip in to help her sometimes
[00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:29.640] and stuff that she's taught to do.
[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:31.320] We have our own yeast
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:32.820] and we make bread
[00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:34.420] and we have our own pizza dough
[00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:35.020] to make pizza.
[00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:37.720] We don't sell pizza crust
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:38.500] like you do in a market.
[00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:39.140] You come here,
[00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:40.420] you get the old-fashioned pizza dough.
[00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:41.480] We make it every day fresh.
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.580] You let it rise.
[00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:43.080] You roll it out.
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:43.880] You make your own pizza.
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.240] And we sell it for 25 cents a pound,
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.020] which is for nothing.
[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:47.080] I mean, you go to market.
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.260] And, you know, it's fresh daily
[00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:50.140] and it's the best dough you can buy.
[00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:50.160] Okay.
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.740] Now, we're in the cheese section.
[00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:53.240] Yeah, we got cheeses from all over.
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:56.040] We got cheese from Finland.
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:59.520] We got cheese from Norway.
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.340] We got cheese from Italy.
[00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:03.440] We got cheese from Wisconsin.
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.760] We got cheese from Switzerland.
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:06.860] We got cheese from all over.
[00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:08.580] We got French brie.
[00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:14.860] And we got an old company who works in Gardena
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.240] who is a very, very old man
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.720] who's got his license,
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:19.320] who's got his...
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:22.040] He's an inspector,
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.540] a U.S. government inspector.
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.160] They have the guy who checks the milk.
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:29.760] He used to have a company in Italy.
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:31.360] And he came out and opened up another company here
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.360] and got the orders set up
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.060] for the U.S. government inspector stuff.
[00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:36.480] And he makes mozzarella like they do in Italy.
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.660] He makes the fresh mozzarella and the water mozzarella.
[00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:39.660] And I got the fresh mozzarella.
[00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:42.000] He makes this either smoked mozzarella,
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.280] humag mozzarella.
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.240] Well, is it bought?
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.040] Aircraft in the...
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.440] Is aircraft in the regatta?
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.240] Aircraft.
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.040] Yeah.
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.160] And we got the...
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.860] Oh, we have three kinds of turkey.
[00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:54.160] We got the real turkey breast.
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.160] We got the chicken breast.
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.160] We got the...
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.160] How do you get the fresh one?
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.160] About $57.
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.160] And it's a little...
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.160] The prosciutto comes from...
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.160] We get it from Wisconsin.
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.160] And we get it from Canada.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.160] You can't get prosciutto.
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:04.160] There'll be a time that prosciutto will be coming from there.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.160] No, I know.
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.160] Right now, you can't bring it in right now.
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.160] What are these meats that are hanging on the bar above the meat gun?
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.160] Those are from San Francisco.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.160] Those are dry sausage.
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.160] Yeah.
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.160] Those gotta be...
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.160] Those are the dry sausage.
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.160] Yeah.
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.160] Those are the dry sausage.
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.160] Yeah.
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.160] Those are the dry sausage.
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.160] Yeah.
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.160] Those are the dry sausage.
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.160] Yeah.
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.160] Those gotta be...
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.160] These are not quite ready yet.
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:25.160] They have to be like this before they can be ready to taste good.
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.160] They have...
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.160] They have white color on the outside?
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.160] Yeah.
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.160] They have regular...
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:33.160] I went to the plant in San Francisco where they have these rooms, the bigger than airplane
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:34.880] hangers, where they hang salami.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:41.660] And they create mold on the walls that...
[00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:43.360] It's transformed to the salami.
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:45.160] You have to age it that way to...
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.160] Yeah.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.160] I mean, it's fascinating.
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.160] It's a square block of salami company.
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.160] Oh, it's Columbus Salami.
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.160] It was fantastic.
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:56.160] I went to the plant with how they make mortadella and these big vats, stainless steel vats.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.160] It looks like pudding when they make it.
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.160] They say, well, mortadella's made out of horse meat.
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.160] That's not...
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.160] It's a lie.
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:05.160] You cannot sell horse meat in an establishment.
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.160] Establishment...
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.160] If you're not...
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:12.820] When you sell horse meat, any amount of horse meat in a place of business, you have to post
[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:16.060] a big sign behind your meat counter, you're selling horse meat, and it's gotta be separate
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.060] from all meats at all.
[00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:18.060] And there's no...
[00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:19.060] They say a lot of cold cuts are made with horse meat.
[00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:20.060] That's not true.
[00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:21.060] A lot of people say that.
[00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:22.060] Yeah.
[00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:23.060] I went to the bank to get some change.
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:24.060] He goes, Anthony, you can have it to my bed.
[00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:25.060] I have a bed with the...
[00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:26.060] What's her name over there?
[00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:27.060] She says, mortadella's made with horse meat.
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.060] Is that true?
[00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:29.060] I go, no, it's made with pork.
[00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:30.060] Pork and veal.
[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:31.060] And 90% of your cold cuts are made from pork.
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:32.060] Let's move along the place here into...
[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:33.060] We have a small fish counter.
[00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:34.060] We don't have two.
[00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:35.060] We don't have a full fish counter.
[00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:36.060] We have a small fish counter.
[00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:37.060] We have a small fish counter.
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:38.060] We have a small fish counter.
[00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:39.060] We have a small fish counter.
[00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:40.060] We have a small fish counter.
[00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:41.060] We don't have two.
[00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:42.060] We don't have a full fish counter.
[00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:43.060] But we have a small frozen fish counter.
[00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:44.060] And as you see, all our meats, there's no packaged foods at all.
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:45.060] Everything's cut to order.
[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:46.060] We got veal.
[00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:47.060] We got pork chops, all from pork loin.
[00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:48.060] We buy our own beef.
[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:49.060] And we age our own beef.
[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:50.060] And here's our homemade sausage.
[00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:51.060] We've got four varieties of sausage you can buy.
[00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:52.060] We make every day.
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:53.060] Well, the average of every other day.
[00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:54.060] They vary by their spices.
[00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:55.060] Yeah.
[00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:56.060] I mean, I don't know.
[00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:57.060] I don't know if you know what I mean.
[00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:58.060] I don't know.
[00:22:58.060 --> 00:22:59.060] I don't know.
[00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:00.060] I don't know.
[00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:01.060] I don't know.
[00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:02.060] I don't know.
[00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:03.060] I don't know.
[00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:04.060] Yeah.
[00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:05.060] It is the regular seasoning.
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:06.060] Then you got a mild.
[00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:07.060] You got the mild, which is the regular seasoning.
[00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:08.060] And you got the fennel with the mild, with fennel seeds in it.
[00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:09.060] And then you got the mild, with the little chili inside.
[00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:10.060] What makes it a little mild hot.
[00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:11.060] It's not a real chili-chili Mexican hot, but it's a mild hot.
[00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:12.060] We make our own ribs.
[00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:13.060] Is that your own cooking?
[00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:14.060] Yeah.
[00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:15.060] It is.
[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:16.060] Then we have the veal.
[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:17.060] We have the big veal that people make veal roast.
[00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:18.060] I mean, we have a veal roast.
[00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:19.060] So, they're like the same.
[00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:20.060] We have the veal roast.
[00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:21.060] So, we have a veal roast.
[00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:22.060] And then we have the...
[00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:23.880] It's a mild hot.
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.400] We make our own ribs.
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.500] Is that your own cook?
[00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.020] Then we have the veal.
[00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:33.660] We have the big veal that people make veal roast.
[00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:35.960] We buy nothing but local chickens.
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:38.240] We don't buy no out of state chickens.
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:40.300] We buy in.
[00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:42.800] How do we do with this guy's next door?
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:43.100] Oh.
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:44.500] So he's doing it.
[00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:45.740] He buys us a big.
[00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:50.420] Hi.
[00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:54.200] I just see our first stand is down now.
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.360] We buy nothing but the best of garlic.
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:57.500] We don't buy the small cloves of garlic.
[00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:58.940] Everything is super colossal garlic.
[00:23:58.940 --> 00:23:59.980] The buds are very big.
[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:00.580] Yeah.
[00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:03.680] It's not something a lot of markets don't carry.
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:06.260] And we're over in the vegetable department.
[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:07.860] I see you've taken some things down.
[00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:08.460] Yeah.
[00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:10.580] We take everything down every night.
[00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:14.580] And everything is redone in the morning, every single morning.
[00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:15.980] We put back in the showcase.
[00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:18.380] We checked and we cleaned.
[00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:20.380] And nothing's left in the showcase overnight.
[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:25.200] Even though it's refrigerated, everything's taken down,
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.260] packed the way it's supposed to be packed,
[00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:30.160] under heavy refrigeration, and then come out the next morning
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.740] and redecorated in a food stand.
[00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:35.700] What were the vegetables you had out here this morning?
[00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:38.140] Everything you find in a big market plus the tie-in items.
[00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:42.420] Like we have mustard greens that are big in a certain part
[00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:44.320] of the year.
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.120] Anything that you can eat, we buy.
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.040] And it's nothing we cannot get.
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:50.320] We sell a lot of sweet, fresh basil, a lot of tie-in
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:50.820] parsley.
[00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:54.100] Matter of fact, we sell fresh.
[00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:55.900] And we have a homemade vinegar.
[00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:56.900] Who makes that?
[00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:57.500] My father.
[00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:58.000] He brings it.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.060] That's a little hobby.
[00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:00.640] He gets old wine from people and lets
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.860] it sit in the mother barrel for six, seven months.
[00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:04.520] And he packs it in old whiskey bottles.
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:06.240] And he sells it for a dollar and a half a bottle.
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.620] And we sell homemade wine vinegar right off the counter.
[00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:09.120] Amazing.
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:11.140] That must be the real wine.
[00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:11.640] Yeah.
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:12.140] Very good.
[00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:14.280] If you run out of gas, you put this in your car.
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:15.100] You could drive home with it.
[00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:16.940] In case you run out of gas on the way home.
[00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:19.360] All right, this one's not too strong.
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:20.320] I think he's cheating on that one.
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:20.820] Yeah.
[00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:26.320] Yeah.
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:27.020] You already smell it.
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:28.820] That'll make your babies born naked.
[00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:29.320] I'll do it.
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.600] OK.
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:32.640] Then our bread.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.360] Our bread's our big thing.
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:39.300] We might sell six loaves of American bread a day.
[00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:46.880] But we'll sell 400 to 400 loaves of French bread and maybe 55
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:50.320] to 75 dozen of French rolls, Italian French rolls a day.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.480] And it comes in twice a day.
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:53.820] So who bakes this bread?
[00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:57.820] I have three bakeries that work for me that bakes me my own bread.
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:59.500] Who makes my pizza dough for me.
[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:02.860] And it comes in twice a day, every day, seven days a week.
[00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:04.520] Are they in San Pedro?
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:05.160] Yeah.
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:06.440] They're all right now in San Pedro.
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:06.940] Yeah.
[00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:10.440] Yeah.
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:13.400] I'm not known to sell my sliced breads or my American white breads
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:14.200] or my wheat breads.
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.660] I'm into my Italian French breads.
[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:18.040] What are these breads here?
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:19.660] That's the old fashioned hardtack.
[00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:20.160] Oh, yeah.
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:24.900] That's like the old tradition hardtack,
[00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:27.560] dipping in soup and stuff like that.
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:28.740] Saw a lot of that.
[00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:29.240] OK.
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.440] And on this?
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:30.940] Yeah.
[00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:33.540] This is a lot of our American.
[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:35.160] Years ago when we first started the business,
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.040] we used to have the old macaroni bins.
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:39.120] We used to sell macaroni out of the bin.
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.200] You want a pound, you just scoop it out and put it in a bag.
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:41.960] We used to do that.
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:42.400] We used to have it.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.280] But that got old.
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.120] And the question couldn't get away with that.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.460] It's a way to change it to one pound packages.
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:49.120] And then we sell five pound packages of pasta
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.160] or one pound packages.
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:54.620] And we carry our harvest of nuts.
[00:26:54.620 --> 00:27:00.200] We have a lot of shelled nuts like almonds, filberts, walnuts,
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.280] trail mix, cashews.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.420] I see something I've never seen before, pumpkin seed oil.
[00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:10.360] I've never seen that in my life.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:10.860] Yeah.
[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:16.460] It's a very specialized cooking.
[00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:19.060] And we sell a lot.
[00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:19.500] We don't sell much.
[00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:21.840] We don't sell much of the dried beans.
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:22.840] But we sell a lot of lentils.
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:26.000] Because in our trade of people, they use a lot of lentils.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000] And we sell a lot of lentils.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.500] We sell mineral water from Yugoslavia.
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:31.500] What is that?
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.500] That's a mineral water from Yugoslavia.
[00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.000] This is shipped in from Yugoslavia.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000] It's very rare.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000] A lot of stores don't even carry.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000] And we sell 90% of my wine is sold by the case
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.500] of a four liter or three liter gallon.
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:47.000] I sell more wine than most of the big supermarkets sell
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:47.500] sometimes.
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:49.260] I mean, because it's a family, ordinary store.
[00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:50.260] And people come in.
[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:51.260] They don't buy a fifth of it.
[00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:52.260] Give me a case of wine.
[00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:53.260] I got a case of wine.
[00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:54.260] And they keep it for a week.
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:55.260] And they drink wine.
[00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:57.260] What are some of your more popular sellers
[00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:58.760] amongst the Italians?
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:27:59.260] It changes.
[00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:00.260] It changes.
[00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:01.260] It fluctuates.
[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:05.260] I sell a lot of a lot of a couple of private labels.
[00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:06.260] I sell a lot of it.
[00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:07.260] They come in.
[00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:08.260] They don't know anything else.
[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:10.260] They just come in and give me a case of banquet.
[00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:12.260] They have that one name in their head.
[00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:14.260] And that's what the families use.
[00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:17.260] They just come in.
[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:18.260] That's what I sell.
[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:19.260] I do sell a lot of wine.
[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:22.260] I sell a lot of American wines, champagne and stuff like that.
[00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:25.260] But when it comes to buying the volume,
[00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:32.260] I sell my volume is the big four liter jug or three liter,
[00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:35.260] four to a case, six to a case.
[00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:36.260] They don't buy one gallon.
[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:39.260] They buy a case.
[00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:42.260] Now, this is one of my biggest special items in the store
[00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:46.260] is my pasta.
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:49.260] My pasta never stays in my store more than three weeks.
[00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:55.260] I mean, I go to maybe 300 cases of pasta a month.
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:59.260] And when people come in, the nationality of people I carry,
[00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:00.260] they don't buy one package of pasta.
[00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:02.260] They buy 10, 15 packages.
[00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:05.260] People live on pasta like the Japanese live on rice.
[00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:12.260] Now, how much of the pasta is domestic versus imported?
[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:16.260] In my store, importers are beginning to be very big.
[00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:18.260] And 90% of my, well, I should say,
[00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:21.260] 95% of my pastas are imported.
[00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:25.260] I don't carry any low grade or 50% grade.
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:29.260] If it's not the best of pasta, I don't carry it.
[00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:30.260] I mean, you can do anything.
[00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:32.260] Not to knock any of the chain markets.
[00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:34.260] I mean, they want to come to A1.
[00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:36.260] They know they're going to get the best.
[00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:37.260] That's what they come here for.
[00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:40.260] Like I said, when people come to A1,
[00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:42.260] they know they're going to get the best, and that's it.
[00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:44.260] And that's what the name stands for.
[00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:46.260] And that's what they come here for.
[00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:47.260] They want to impress somebody.
[00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:48.260] They come to A1.
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:49.260] Help me out.
[00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:50.260] Give me something that's good.
[00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:51.260] They ask me.
[00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:52.260] Give me something good.
[00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:53.260] Is this good?
[00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:54.260] No, get this.
[00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:55.260] Are you telling the truth?
[00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.260] And the other thing you got to do, you never lie to your customer.
[00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:57.260] Never.
[00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:58.260] Make a sale.
[00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:00.260] You'd rather lose a sale than to lie to a customer and put the money in the register
[00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:01.260] and they don't ever come.
[00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:04.260] Once you lie to a customer, they don't trust you no more, no matter what.
[00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:12.260] Once you got the trust in the customer, no matter what anybody else says, they're going
[00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:13.260] to come to you.
[00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:17.260] And this is one of my very best pastas here.
[00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:18.260] This is very well-known pasta.
[00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:19.260] I mean, this sells in the store for...
[00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:20.260] What do you call this?
[00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:21.260] This is the Diverti.
[00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:22.260] It's a very, very high-equired pasta.
[00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:23.260] It sells in the market or any place where a discount has it.
[00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:24.260] It sells for $1.39.
[00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:25.260] With the volume I sell, I could sell it for $1.09 and make a few cents.
[00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:26.260] Like I said, the fast nickel in a slow quarter.
[00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:27.260] And when it comes to...
[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:28.260] I have another certain kind of business.
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:29.260] Yeah?
[00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:30.260] Yeah.
[00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:31.260] I'm a big fan of the pasta.
[00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:32.260] I'm a big fan of the pasta.
[00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:33.260] I'm a big fan of the pasta.
[00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:34.260] I'm a big fan of the pasta.
[00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:35.260] I'm a big fan of the pasta.
[00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:36.260] I'm a big fan of the pasta.
[00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:37.260] I'm a big fan of the pasta.
[00:30:37.260 --> 00:31:00.040] You do have it in there on theспit, for to fill.
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:06.740] It's a nice place.
[00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:37.240] Thank you.
[00:31:37.260 --> 00:32:07.240] Thank you.
[00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:23.040] Thank you.
[00:32:37.260 --> 00:33:07.240] Thank you.
