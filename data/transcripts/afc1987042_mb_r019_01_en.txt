[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000] What's your full name?
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000] My full name is An Vu.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000] An Ngoc Vu.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000] Vu is my last name.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000] But they call me Hong.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000] That's my nickname.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000] But often people call me Hong.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000] It's easy to remember.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000] Just Hong Kong.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000] Sometimes I introduce it.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000] My name is An Vu.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000] Easy to forget my name.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000] Because Hong is a short name.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000] So your last name is Vu?
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000] Yes, Vu. V is you.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000] But in Vietnam it would be Vu Hanh.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000] Yeah, Vu Hanh.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000] But in here it's...
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000] So how did you get the nickname Hong?
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000] Hong? Oh, I don't know.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000] Does that mean something?
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000] Yeah, Hong is...
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000] It's like a king, you know.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000] It's not really exactly meaning like that.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000] But it's like a king.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000] Were you born in Saigon?
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000] Yeah, I was born in Saigon.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000] And what year?
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:41.000] No, I lived with my cousin when I was about five years old until I escaped my country.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000] My parents and the whole family lived in Binh Ho.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000] Binh Ho is about 20 miles from Saigon.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000] But I didn't live with my parents.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000] You didn't.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000] You were born in 1962?
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000] Yes, 1962.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000] What month?
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000] What month?
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000] Oh, November.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000] November 1962.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000] So you don't remember too much about the Vietnamese War?
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000] No, not really.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000] And you came...
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000] Because, you know, I lived in Saigon.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000] And the struggle happened in the other city around Saigon.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000] Maybe it's in the middle of my country.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000] Because my country is divided into three parts.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000] Three parts, one in North Vietnam, one in the middle of Vietnam, and the other one is in South Vietnam.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000] But it usually happened in the middle.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000] Because there's a boundary in the middle.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000] So you weren't involved in the war directly?
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000] No.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.000] When the Communists came, you left in, you said 1975?
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000] Excuse me?
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000] When did you leave Vietnam and go to Indonesia?
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000] Oh, 1975.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000] 1981.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000] 1981?
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000] Yes.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000] And I lived in Indonesia for three years.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000] Three years?
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000] Yes.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000] Yes.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000] At that camp?
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000] Yes.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000] I came there just about three years.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000] But I tried to learn English in Indonesia.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000] I mean, in refugee camp.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000] Right.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000] And I came to USA.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000] I know how to speak English, how to understand the people talk and something.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000] But it's not too much, you know.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000] Just, you know, you can learn a little bit.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000] But I think I learned a lot in the camp.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000] You know, when I was young, I was in the refugee camp.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000] And I was a refugee.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000] I was a refugee.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000] I was a refugee.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000] I was a refugee.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000] I was a refugee.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000] And I was a refugee.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000] I was a refugee.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000] I was a refugee.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000] I was a refugee.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000] But it's not too much, you know.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.060] Just understand and talking the regular things.
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:04.600] I have three months in the college for English, I mean, studying English in New Orleans.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.600] What English is your second language?
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.600] Yes.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.600] ESL?
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.600] Yes, ESL.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.980] Were you working in Vietnam?
[00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:12.980] No.
[00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:13.980] You were too young.
[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:14.980] Yeah, I was too young.
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:15.980] Yeah.
[00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:16.980] You were too young.
[00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:17.980] Yeah, I was too young.
[00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:24.440] I went to a school in my country, high school.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:32.780] After I graduated high school, and then after that, I just tried to escape my country.
[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.640] So I got no job.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:44.640] I mean, I spent the whole time to looking for the way to escape my country.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.040] But that time, my parents arranged.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.980] Yeah.
[00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:48.980] They arranged for me to escape, you know.
[00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:49.980] They arranged?
[00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:50.980] Yes.
[00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:51.980] They arranged.
[00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:52.980] Are they still there?
[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:53.980] Yeah, they were still there.
[00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:54.980] Are they still there?
[00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:55.980] Yeah, they were still there.
[00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:56.980] Can they come here?
[00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:57.980] No, no, I don't think so.
[00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:58.980] Because my parents are too old.
[00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:10.940] So they thought if they come here, their life is difficult, you know, difficult for
[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:11.940] the old people.
[00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:12.940] Yes.
[00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:13.940] Especially about English, you know, second language.
[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:14.940] Right.
[00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:15.940] How can they talk?
[00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:16.940] How can they speak?
[00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:17.940] Yeah.
[00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.900] How can they understand the people?
[00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.940] And the other things, I thought, is quite different than the country, you know, different
[00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:26.940] country.
[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.940] What are some of the biggest differences?
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:39.820] Because when the old people live in my country, they are very friendship with the
[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:40.820] other people.
[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.100] I mean, it's not a neighborhood.
[00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.940] They just want to go to their friend.
[00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:46.940] They just go to their friend.
[00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:47.940] Yeah.
[00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:48.940] Visit their friend.
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:49.940] Visit there.
[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:50.940] They don't need to make appointment.
[00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:51.940] They don't need to call.
[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.940] And, you know, just come there to visit them.
[00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:04.940] And I know communism in my country, very hard to live.
[00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:11.940] But the old people, they still feel more comfortable, you know, because they are old.
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:12.940] They just live.
[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:13.940] They don't care.
[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:14.940] And, you know, it's a...
[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:15.940] Yeah.
[00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:24.180] And, you know, isn't the young people scared because the communists are forced them to
[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.940] join in the army or something?
[00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.100] They have to fight with the other country.
[00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.100] And they have no freedom.
[00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:37.940] And do whatever they do, they have to look around and scare something, you know.
[00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.940] So it's the young people who want to leave more than the old people.
[00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:43.940] Yeah.
[00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:58.940] Some old people come here, and they are boring, and the trouble of the language, the culture,
[00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.940] and then they try to go back to country.
[00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:01.940] Oh.
[00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:02.940] Yeah.
[00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.940] Did you go to the temple or church?
[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.180] I'm going to a church every Saturday.
[00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.180] Which one?
[00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.180] Oh, St. Patrick's.
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.180] Oh, yeah.
[00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:14.420] St. Patrick's.
[00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:15.420] Oh, okay.
[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.420] So you're Catholic?
[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.420] Yes, I'm Catholic.
[00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.420] Are a lot of Vietnamese and Low Catholic?
[00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:22.420] Not really.
[00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:23.420] Just about 70 or 100 people.
[00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:24.420] That's all.
[00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.420] Not too much.
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:26.420] Not too many.
[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:27.420] Are some Buddhist?
[00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:28.420] Other religions?
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.420] Yeah.
[00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.420] Some Buddhist.
[00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:31.420] Did they go to a temple?
[00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:32.420] I don't know because there's no temple.
[00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:33.420] There's no temple.
[00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:34.420] There's no temple.
[00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.420] There's no temple.
[00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.420] There's no temple.
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:37.420] There's no temple.
[00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:38.420] There's no temple.
[00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:39.420] There's no temple.
[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:40.420] There's no temple.
[00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:41.420] There's no temple.
[00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:42.420] There's no temple.
[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.180] There's no temple.
[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:44.180] There's no temple in here.
[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.180] Just Cambodian temple.
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.180] Yeah, I know.
[00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:50.060] So maybe it's a difference from Vietnamese temple.
[00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:54.180] So they don't want to come, you know?
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:08:01.180] How about customs like food?
[00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.180] Oh, food.
[00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.020] Yeah.
[00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:12.420] You know, the most Asian people doesn't get along with America.
[00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:13.420] They don't.
[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:14.420] No, they don't.
[00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:15.420] Except the young people.
[00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:16.420] They come here.
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:19.420] Since they was a boy, was young, then they grow up in America.
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:23.420] And so they get along with American food.
[00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:36.420] But all people come here, they couldn't, they can't eat American food.
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:38.420] Sometimes just a little bit, you know?
[00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:39.420] But they can't eat American food.
[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:40.420] Right.
[00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:41.420] Okay.
[00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:48.420] What are the main kinds of food that they want to eat?
[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.420] Oh, just rice.
[00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:51.420] Rice?
[00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:52.420] Rice, yes.
[00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:55.420] They eat rice every day.
[00:08:55.420 --> 00:09:02.420] And just rice and some special food in my country.
[00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:07.420] I mean, it's like noodles or something.
[00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:10.420] They call it pho.
[00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:13.420] That's what they call it in my country, pho.
[00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:15.420] Ph-o.
[00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:16.420] Those are noodles?
[00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:17.420] Yes.
[00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:28.420] Noodles, they put some soup in there, some beef, some vegetables, something.
[00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:33.420] That's a famous food in my country.
[00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.420] Do you prepare that yourself at home?
[00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:37.420] Yeah.
[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:38.420] Do you cook?
[00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.860] Yeah, it's not too hard to cook.
[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:44.560] They cook by beef bone.
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.240] Beef bone they put in.
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.240] They put something else in.
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.420] What kind of vegetables?
[00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:56.420] Oh, it's like bean, it's like soy beans.
[00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:58.420] Soy beans.
[00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.420] Yeah.
[00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.540] And some kind of vegetable.
[00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.420] I don't know how to call that.
[00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:06.420] But American doesn't eat that.
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:07.420] Okay.
[00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:08.420] No?
[00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:09.420] No.
[00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.420] Do you wear your body?
[00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:13.420] Sometimes Americans eat that because they eat that all the time.
[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:19.420] I mean, they can come to restaurant, they order pho all the time, so they know what's
[00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:20.420] that.
[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:21.420] They can eat that.
[00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.420] Where do you get your food then?
[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:30.420] No, in a Laos store, in Cambodian store.
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.420] We don't have Vietnamese store in here.
[00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:33.420] No?
[00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:34.420] We have some in Boston.
[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:35.420] But, yeah.
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:36.420] Okay.
[00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:37.420] We have some in Boston.
[00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:38.420] But it's not quite different from Laotian and Vietnamese food.
[00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:39.420] So Laotian food and Vietnamese food is similar?
[00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:40.420] It's not quite different but it's a little bit.
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:41.420] You use same vegetables?
[00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:44.420] Yes, same, but some kind I never eat in Cambodian or Laotian food.
[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:45.420] You don't?
[00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:46.420] No, I don't.
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:47.420] Why?
[00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:48.420] Because it's like American they doesn't eat.
[00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:49.420] It's like, I don't know what it's called.
[00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:50.420] That's why I don't eat it.
[00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:51.420] Why?
[00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:52.420] That's why I don't eat it.
[00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:53.420] Why?
[00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:54.420] Because it's like American.
[00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.420] If they're like, a little bit different.
[00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:56.420] I don't eat that.
[00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:57.420] I don't eat that.
[00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:58.420] And I don't know, I don't know.
[00:10:58.420 --> 00:10:59.420] I just don't know.
[00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:00.420] I don't know.
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:01.420] You don't?
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:02.420] No, I don't.
[00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:03.420] Why?
[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:08.980] Because it's not American, and they don't eat Vietnamese food.
[00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:12.100] Sometimes they can't eat that.
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:15.100] Sometimes I can't eat that, so I can't eat.
[00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:24.660] What's the main difference between Vietnamese food and, say, Laotian or Cambodian
[00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:26.740] or Thai food?
[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:30.740] I don't know, because Asian food has a different smell.
[00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:31.740] Different spices.
[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:32.740] Yeah, different spices.
[00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:37.240] So I don't know how to explain that.
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.920] But I just know I can't eat that.
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:40.920] I can't eat that.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.920] Is it too much fish, or you eat fish?
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.420] Yeah, I eat fish.
[00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:49.420] They call sauce fish.
[00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:56.720] But at the restaurant where we were, the Vietnamese restaurant, they have Vietnamese
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.720] food.
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:58.720] Vietnamese, good Vietnamese food?
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:11:59.720] Yes, Vietnamese food.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.720] Are there any other in Lowell?
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.720] No, just that one.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.720] That one just opened about a year ago.
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.720] That one just opened?
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.720] Yes.
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:20.720] Then they serve with Vietnamese food, American food, sometimes Chinese food.
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:25.720] Sometimes they try to create new food.
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:26.720] Okay.
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:30.720] Mix up with American and Chinese and Vietnamese.
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.720] Do you like Chinese food?
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.720] Yeah, I like it.
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:34.720] Yeah.
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:39.720] What kind of American food do you eat if you eat Laotian food?
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:50.720] Just like beef and steak, sometimes in a hamburger, guapas, you know.
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:51.720] Fast food?
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.720] No.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.720] My favorite food is here, you know.
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.720] You know, perpai, chicken fried.
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:58.720] Oh, fried chicken.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.720] They call it perpai.
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:00.720] Oh.
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.720] Is that Vietnamese?
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.720] No, I mean that's American food.
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.720] Oh, it's fried chicken?
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:04.720] Yeah, fried chicken.
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.720] But they call—it's not Kentucky.
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.720] It's not Kentucky.
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:07.720] That's another one.
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:08.720] No, they call it perpai.
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.720] Oh, okay.
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:10.720] I don't know that.
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:11.720] It came from New Orleans.
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:12.720] Papaya.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.720] Papaya, yeah.
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:14.720] Okay.
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.720] Perpai.
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.720] Yeah.
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.720] So, because the first time, I just—I just—I just ate it.
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:18.720] I ate it.
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.720] I ate it.
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.720] You ate it?
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:21.720] Yeah.
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:22.720] You ate it?
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.720] Yeah.
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:24.720] I ate it.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.720] I ate it.
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:28.720] Because the first time, I just—I just come to USA.
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:36.320] Somebody bought for me some, and when I left in refugee camp, I don't have enough food
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.320] to eat, you know.
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.320] Right.
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.320] That's right.
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:46.220] You know, when I see this, oh, it's—it's good when, you know, when you are hungry,
[00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.220] you know.
[00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:48.220] Right.
[00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:49.220] So I eat that.
[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:50.220] Oh, I feel good.
[00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:51.220] That.
[00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:52.220] And I eat all the time when I leave.
[00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:53.220] Oh, okay.
[00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:54.720] I eat all the time when I leave, later.
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:55.720] Do you eat hamburgers?
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:56.720] Yeah, sometimes.
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:57.720] Pizza?
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.720] Yeah.
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:08.780] I don't like it, but I still eat that, because it's a comfortable for—when I go to school,
[00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:15.220] I have just about an hour, half hour to get out for lunch.
[00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:16.820] So it's easy.
[00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:21.820] Just come there to order one, and just a few minutes to eat that, and then go back to school.
[00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:25.320] But when you kick it home, you cook Vietnamese food?
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.320] Yes.
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:29.320] I cook Vietnamese food.
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.820] Sometimes Chinese food.
[00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:37.320] It's not different from Chinese and Vietnamese food.
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.320] It's similar?
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.320] Much the same?
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.320] Yeah.
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.320] Much the same.
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.320] You say you live with your brother?
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.820] Yes, my brother and my sister.
[00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:47.820] Oh, your sister.
[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:48.820] Yes.
[00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:49.820] Are you the oldest?
[00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:50.820] No.
[00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:51.820] My brother—.
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:52.820] My older brother.
[00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:53.820] Oh.
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:54.820] How old is he?
[00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:55.820] He was born in 1960.
[00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:56.820] Oh.
[00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:57.820] So he's twenty-seven.
[00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:58.820] Yeah.
[00:14:58.820 --> 00:14:59.820] He's two years older than I am.
[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:00.820] Two years older?
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:01.820] Yes.
[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:02.820] And how old is your sister?
[00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:03.820] About twelve years old.
[00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:04.820] About twelve years old?
[00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:05.820] Yes.
[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:06.820] She's going to school?
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:07.820] Yes.
[00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:08.820] He went to St. Patrick's School.
[00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:09.820] Oh.
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:10.820] Private school.
[00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:11.820] He's a good boy.
[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:12.820] He's a good boy.
[00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:13.820] He's a good boy.
[00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:14.820] He's a good boy.
[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:15.820] He's a good boy.
[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:16.820] Yeah.
[00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:17.820] He's a good boy.
[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:18.820] He's a good boy.
[00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:19.820] He's a good boy.
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:20.820] He's a good boy.
[00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:21.820] He's a good boy.

[00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:23.820] He's a good boy.
[00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:24.820] He's a good boy.
[00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:25.820] He's a good boy.
[00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:26.820] He's a good boy.
[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:27.820] He's a good boy.
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:28.820] He's a good boy.
[00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:29.820] I never know how to say this.
[00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:30.820] I never know.
[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:31.820] He was just a little girl.
[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:32.820] He's four years old.
[00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:33.820] He grew up in St. Patrick's School.
[00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:34.820] He's a very good, because some sisters in there— because that's a private school
[00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:35.820] and a Catholic school, and they tried to take care of my sister, you know.
[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:36.820] I mean, my sister came to America for two years later.
[00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:37.820] I mean, two years later, yes.
[00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:38.820] Two years after you?
[00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:39.820] No.
[00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:40.820] She was a little girl.
[00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:41.820] She was pretty.
[00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:42.820] She was a little girl.
[00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:43.820] She was a little girl.
[00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:48.000] for two years. Two years later, I mean two years later.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000] Two years after you?
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:59.540] No, she come the same time. First he went to, I sent him, I sent her to Chicago. My
[00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:08.640] cousin lived there. And then she went to Chicago school. And after that, two years later, I
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:18.880] took her from Chicago to Rome. She doesn't know how to speak English. She doesn't know
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:27.220] how to, I mean, she's very stupid because she lived in America for two years. I don't
[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.220] know why.
[00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:29.740] And she didn't learn English?
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:38.540] Yeah. She did. She went to school. But after, I sent her to the St. Patrick's school.
[00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:38.620] And I sent her to the St. Patrick's. And after that, she went to school in Chicago.
[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:44.840] After one year, she speaks English very good, it's like American voice and accent, it's
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:45.840] not American.
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:46.840] Yeah.
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:49.960] Maybe the sister take care too much in the school.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.740] She's younger, too.
[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:52.740] Yes.
[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:53.740] It's easier when you're younger.
[00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:54.740] Yes.
[00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:57.740] She was, what, nine years old when she came here?
[00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:00.100] Yes, nine years old.
[00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:03.920] Do you think she's becoming more Americanized?
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:04.920] Yeah.
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:11.920] She loves American food, do something like American culture, you know.
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:16.540] And your brother, is he working?
[00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:18.540] Yes, he's working.
[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.540] What does he do?
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:26.040] He's doing something about computer, something in the world.
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.040] Oh, right.
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.040] Yes.
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.040] Electronics.
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.040] Yeah, electronics.
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:33.040] Did you live in New Orleans with him?
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.040] No.
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:34.920] You didn't?
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:35.920] Oh, yes.
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:42.920] I lived in New Orleans with him, and I came here before he did.
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:49.920] I came here for a year later, and I called him and he came here.
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:56.920] He came here just about two years, 1986.
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:03.920] What are some of the other customs that you have?
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:04.920] Customs that are changing from Vietnam to America.
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:05.920] They say language is one, learn English.
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:06.920] Yeah.
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:07.920] Maybe the life of younger people change too much.
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:08.920] Too much.
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:09.920] Yes, too much.
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:22.920] Because in my country, if the younger people is, I mean, under 18, they have to know very
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:23.920] much about the culture.
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:24.920] Right.
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:25.920] And they have to know their culture.
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:26.920] Yes.
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:27.920] Right.
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:28.920] They have to learn English.
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:29.920] Yes.
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:30.920] That's right.
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:31.920] How did you know the culture of the people here?
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:38.980] I mean, under 18, when they go somewhere, they have to ask their parents.
[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:47.520] They do whatever they do, they have to ask parents and need ideas from parents.
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:53.980] When they come here, there's some people, they don't care, the parents, you know,
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:57.860] just want to go somewhere, you know.
[00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:58.860] They don't care.
[00:18:58.860 --> 00:18:59.860] They just want to go.
[00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:00.860] So the—
[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:01.860] It's quite different.
[00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:02.860] The discipline in the family.
[00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:03.860] Parents control.
[00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:04.860] The parents can control them.
[00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:05.860] Not as much control.
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:06.860] That's more like an American family.
[00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:07.860] Yeah, I know.
[00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:08.860] What about—
[00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:15.860] Even the older people, I mean, over 18 years, they don't care.
[00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:18.860] They don't care.
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:24.220] But the older people, they don't care.
[00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:26.860] I mean, it's a different thing.
[00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:28.080] I don't know.
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:29.280] I don't know.
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:30.280] I don't know.
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:30.640] I don't know.
[00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:31.840] I don't know.
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:36.320] When they go somewhere, they have a date, and something, they still have to ask their
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:37.320] parents.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:44.040] They— Until they get married, they still belong to the parents.
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:47.160] I mean, the parents still control them.
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.400] Sometimes they need to do something, ask parents.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.800] That's in my country, you know.
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:54.800] Yes.
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.780] Do parents pick who you will marry?
[00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:57.780] Not really.
[00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:59.480] That's a very old question.
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:00.700] Very old.
[00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:06.700] It happens sometimes, but it's not a lot of people do that now.
[00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:15.700] But young people here are dating in American, like Americans, if they want to go out with
[00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:17.700] someone, they just go?
[00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:18.700] Yeah.
[00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:19.700] Just for a date?
[00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:20.700] Yeah.
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.700] Or a dance, or a party, or a movie?
[00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:24.700] Yeah.
[00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:33.700] Some people live, I mean, the most it happens with the male people.
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:37.700] More the boys than the girls?
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:41.700] I mean more the girls than the boys, the females.
[00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:43.700] They're changing more, the girls?
[00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:44.700] Yeah.
[00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:51.700] Because if they live here with their parents, they belong to parents, it's better.
[00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.700] But they come here by themselves.
[00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:58.400] They just control themselves.
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:02.460] So they just do whatever they want.
[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:10.000] Some people, they just want to dance and go to a party, no school, you know?
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.700] Because they have no parents here.
[00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:12.700] Because they have no parents.
[00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:13.700] Yeah.
[00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:14.700] Will that be a problem with your sister?
[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:17.700] Or will she do what you and your sister?
[00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:23.700] No, because my sister, I take care of her, like my parents, you know?
[00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:24.700] Right.
[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.700] She respects you as what you say?
[00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:28.700] Yes.
[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:35.700] Because I really don't want my sister go out much, you know?
[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:43.700] Because sometimes they get along with American culture.
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:46.700] I can't control her, you know?
[00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:48.700] Sometimes they just want to go.
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:50.700] They go.
[00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:51.700] She wants to go.
[00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.700] She doesn't want to ask me.
[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:57.700] If she go out too much.
[00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:00.700] But she's only twelve.
[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:01.700] Yeah, only twelve.
[00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:02.700] She's locked herself.
[00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:03.700] Yeah.
[00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:06.700] Another couple of years, she may start dating.
[00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:07.700] Yeah, I know.
[00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:08.700] Things will change.
[00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:11.700] But I just try to keep her in my control.
[00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:12.700] Control, yeah.
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:19.700] But I just try to do it.
[00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:20.700] But I'm not going to do it.
[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:21.700] Mm hmm.
[00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:22.700] I'm not going to do it.
[00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:25.920] Do you speak French?
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:26.920] No.
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:27.920] My parents speaks French.
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:30.920] The most, all the people in my country speak French.
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:33.400] Yes, I speak French.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:38.700] Yeah, you know, because French came to my country before.
[00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:39.700] Right.
[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:40.700] Before Americans.
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:41.700] Yeah.
[00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:42.700] Before Americans.
[00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.740] Then, after Americans come to my country, all of the people changed to English.
[00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:46.740] Smart as a desenvolv.
[00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:50.740] At the beginning, our Motherland speak French.
[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:51.740] Ah, yes.
[00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:56.840] I'm trying to study English.
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:02.040] I studied English in my high school in Vietnam.
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.040] Even after the Communists?
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.040] Yeah.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:05.040] They teach English, too?
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.040] Yes.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:11.040] They teach English and Chinese and, you know, Soviet.
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.040] Russian?
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:17.040] I don't know what I call that.
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.040] Soviet?
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:19.040] Soviet?
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:20.040] Yeah.
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.040] That's Russian?
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:22.040] The language?
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.040] Yes.
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.040] That the Soviets speak?
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.040] Yeah.
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.040] It's Russian.
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.040] Russian?
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:28.040] You call that?
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:29.040] Yeah.
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.040] Oh.
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.040] I learned that in high school.
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.040] I took Russian.
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.040] Do you still, do you speak Vietnamese mostly with other people?
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.040] I think I'm very good at it.
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.040] Oh, okay.
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.040] I think I'm good at it.
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.040] I'm not a big fan of that.
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.040] I don't know how to speak it.
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.040] I don't know how to speak it.
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:40.040] My mother taught me how to speak it.
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.040] I think I'm good at it.
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.040] Okay.
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:43.040] I'm not good at it.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.040] I'm not good at it.
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.040] I'm not good at it.
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.040] Yeah.
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.040] I'm not good at it.
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.040] I'm not good at it.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.040] I'm not good at it.
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.040] I'm not good at it.
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.040] Don't you speak with other Vietnamese in the whole?
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.040] Yes.
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.040] That's my trouble.
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.040] Yeah.
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:59.600] I mean, it's good for me when I keep my language, my mother language.
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.600] Right.
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:09.540] But it's no good when I talk English still have Vietnamese accent sometimes.
[00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:14.760] The people don't understand what I want to say.
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:18.380] I live with American friend for .
[00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:18.560] Here?
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:29.760] a few months in Beverly near my school. That's how I speak English better. But I don't
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:37.100] get along with American culture, so I left him and moved out.
[00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:39.100] You don't get along with American culture?
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:40.100] No.
[00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:41.100] What do you mean?
[00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:48.880] No, I mean, I don't know. When I lived with him, he went to work in the morning
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:57.360] until the nighttime. Just like that, every day, go out and go back and go out and go
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:04.600] back. Nothing happened in my life. And I go to school and go back and study, and then
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:11.080] go to sleep and go to school. It's just like a circle.
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:19.400] I can't cook at home because I live with him. I'm scared. I don't know yet, but
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:26.140] I'm scared he doesn't want to smell some Vietnamese food. But I just try to avoid
[00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:27.140] that.
[00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:28.140] Did he cook?
[00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:35.560] No, sometimes. He went to restaurant, hamburger, guap, or something. That's why I have to
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:40.840] go to American food, too.
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:40.960] Okay.
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:47.940] I mean, hamburger, guap, every day. It's boring, so I can't live there anymore.
[00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:55.140] That's true. So when you came back here, you don't speak English as often?
[00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.140] No, except in my school.
[00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:59.140] You don't have any friends who speak Vietnamese?
[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:00.140] Yes.
[00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:06.140] When you speak English, you thinking in Vietnamese?
[00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:10.840] Yeah, I did when I was a few years old.
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:22.180] I was a few months, and I just come here. I mean, a few years ago, when I speak English,
[00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:28.900] I had to translate into my language in my mind. So far, sometimes I just talk, talk,
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:35.600] talk, because I talk often, you know. So I don't have to transfer into my language.
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.840] What are some of the other big challenges you have faced?
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:38.840] I think I have a lot of challenges.
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:39.840] You know, I'm not a good speaker. I'm not good at speaking. But I'm not good at speaking.
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:40.840] I'm not good at speaking. I'm not good at speaking. I'm not good at speaking. I'm not good at speaking.
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:41.840] I'm not good at speaking. I'm not good at speaking. I'm not good at speaking.
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:42.840] I'm not good at speaking. I'm not good at speaking.
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:43.840] Yeah.
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:47.840] You have a lot of differences in traditional Vietnamese ways in here in America.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:54.840] Is that the same? Health or medical? Is that different?
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:27:04.640] Yeah, it's a difference. You know, some of my people, when they get sick, they just
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:10.700] stay home. They got a cold or something, they stay home and do something else. And
[00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:16.700] they use the coin to scrap the body.
[00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:19.700] Of the coin?
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:20.700] Yeah.
[00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:21.700] Oh.
[00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:22.700] Yeah.
[00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:23.700] They scrap the body like this. Yeah.
[00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:24.700] They rub the part of their body with the coin?
[00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:25.700] Yes.
[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:26.700] The part that hurts?
[00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:27.700] No.
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:28.700] Just like if you hurt yourself?
[00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:29.700] No. Just very light. Yeah. That's in my country.
[00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:30.700] That's all?
[00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:31.700] And they, you know, they don't have to do anything. They don't have to do anything.
[00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:32.700] They don't have to do anything.
[00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:33.700] Yeah.
[00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:34.700] So you're not a doctor?
[00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:35.700] No.
[00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:36.700] No.
[00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:37.700] No.
[00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:38.700] No.
[00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:39.700] No.
[00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:40.700] No.
[00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:41.700] No.
[00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:42.700] No.
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:43.700] They don't have to do anything.
[00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:44.700] No.
[00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:45.700] No.
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:46.700] No.
[00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:47.700] No.
[00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:48.700] But they used to work at the hospital.
[00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:49.700] Yeah.
[00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:50.700] Yeah.
[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:51.700] Yeah.
[00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:52.700] And they didn't have a lot of money.
[00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:53.700] Yeah.
[00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:54.700] Yeah.
[00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:55.700] Yeah.
[00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:56.700] Yeah.
[00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:57.700] Yeah.
[00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:58.700] Yeah.
[00:27:58.700 --> 00:27:59.700] And then they did that.
[00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:00.700] Yeah.
[00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:01.700] Yeah.
[00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:02.700] They did that?
[00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:03.700] Yeah.
[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:04.700] Yeah.
[00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:05.700] Yeah.
[00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:06.700] Yeah.
[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:07.700] Yeah.
[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:08.700] Yeah.
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:09.700] Yeah.
[00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:13.700] medicine. Not too many.
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:19.700] There's a Vietnamese doctor in Lo, a medical doctor.
[00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:25.700] Yes, we have four Vietnamese doctors.
[00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:30.700] Is that where most Vietnamese go for the doctor?
[00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:42.700] Yes. That's an important thing in Lo. Some people, they don't speak English. They can't go to an American doctor.
[00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:50.700] Then they go to a Vietnamese doctor. It's easy to explain something happened.
[00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:54.700] Who are the Vietnamese doctors? I just knew one.
[00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:59.700] Oh, that's the...
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:00.700] Thanks.
[00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:05.700] Do, Do Chung Hong. He's my friend.
[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:11.700] And the other is named Quang.
[00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:14.700] I know about two.
[00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:18.700] Yeah, I just know two doctors. Oh, three?
[00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:21.700] Quang and Heap.
[00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:27.700] I don't think you know that.
[00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:29.700] But most Cambodians,
[00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:37.700] and Lao Tzu went to, going to a Vietnamese doctor, because they don't have doctor.
[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:39.700] Yeah, there's no Cambodian.
[00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:51.700] No. But they have, they have translator. I mean the people translate to Cambodian language.
[00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:53.700] Oh, at the office, at the doctors, they have translator?
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:54.700] Yes.
[00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:56.700] Is there a Vietnamese organization in Lo?
[00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:57.700] Yes.
[00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:10.700] Like there's the Cambodian Mutual Assistance Association, and the Laotian American Organization.
[00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:19.700] Is there a Vietnamese Assistance Association or something like that, a club, or an agency?
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:20.700] No.
[00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:21.700] No?
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:22.700] No.
[00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:23.700] No.
[00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:24.700] I don't know.
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:30.700] I don't know, but there's no system in here.
[00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:39.700] Because the Vietnamese, they, the doctors, they hire, they hire Vietnamese who know how
[00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:43.700] to speak Cambodian, how to speak Laotian.
[00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:46.700] And work with him, and translate.
[00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:48.700] They help.
[00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:52.700] And they, sometimes they just go to the doctor.
[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:55.700] They don't have to make an appointment.
[00:30:55.700 --> 00:31:02.380] They just come and take, you know, something.
[00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:07.880] So it's a more comfortable table for Asian people, because Asian people, they don't
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:11.200] need to make an appointment when they come to see together.
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.200] That's the way it is in—
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:13.200] Yeah, that's the way it is.
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.200] —in Vietnam.
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:15.200] You just go when you—
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.200] Yes.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.200] And you sit and wait your turn?
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.200] You wait for your turn?
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:19.200] Yes.
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.200] Just waiting for that turn.
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:21.200] So they don't make appointments?
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.200] No.
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.200] Is that a big difference in everything?
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.200] Yeah, that's a big difference.
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.200] Not just with doctors, but do Americans seem to think—
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.200] Yes, you know—
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.200] —make more appointments and run by the clock more times?
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.200] Yeah.
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:43.200] You know, in my country, the most people, they own—I don't know, they own a lot
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:48.200] of the food.
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:49.200] Yeah.
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:55.200] They own their house, because the house, they don't need air conditioner, they don't
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:00.200] need heater, because the weather is the same all the time.
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:08.200] So everybody owns their house, and they don't have to pay for the house.
[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:13.200] They don't have to pay for utility, you know.
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:14.200] Utility, fine.
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:15.200] So, yeah.
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:16.200] So, yeah.
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.200] So, yeah.
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.200] Yeah.
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:26.200] So sometimes they thought, oh, the last thing in my country is easier than American, because
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:34.200] they don't have a bill, telephone bill, no telephone bill, no—yeah, they have an
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.200] electricity bill.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:38.200] But no water bill, no insurance, you know.
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.200] How about taxes?
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.200] No taxes, no.
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.200] Except some business, you know.
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:42.200] Business expenses, right?
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.200] Yeah.
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.200] Business expenses.
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.200] So, yeah.
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:46.200] Right.
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:49.760] business, you know, business, they have to pay tax.
