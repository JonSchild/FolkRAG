[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000] I have to have a little introduction here. Today is the fourth day of August 1977. This is Mr. Johnny Garrison. Is that right?
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000] Right.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000] Of Fitzgerald, Georgia. What's the address here?
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000] 207 East Central.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000] 207 East Central. And this is Johnny's Grocery.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000] Johnny's Grocery, right.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000] How long have you been in business here?
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000] Let's see. I've been here since March 19, 1939.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000] 1939. How did you happen to get into this business?
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:45.000] Well, I originally worked as a grocery clerk at two other grocery stores in this area.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:55.000] I worked a couple of years, or three, four. It was known as Rogers then, now Colonial.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000] Then I worked about eight or nine years for the grocery store.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000] I worked for the Davis Brothers before coming here.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000] Yeah. And had this been a grocery owned by somebody else that you bought?
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.000] Yes. Yes, it was. It was a retail grocery and feed store owned by Pittman Grocery Company in McRae, Georgia.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000] And did you buy the thing lock stock and go?
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:27.000] I came here as manager. I managed it for Pittman Grocery Company in a most unusual and unique way.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000] Mm-hmm.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000] I was ran as a sharecropper. I wouldn't run a farm.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000] I managed the store and paid the expenses.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000] And if we made a dollar, I got 50 cents and Pittman Grocery Company got 50 cents.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000] We operated on halves.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000] Right. They provided the money for stocking the store.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000] They provided everything. All I had to do was do the work or have it done and pay the expenses.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000] I stood to full expense.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000] When did you buy the place yourself?
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000] I bought it October 20, 1945.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000] Right at the end of the war, right?
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000] I'd forgotten that, but I believe it was.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000] Did you buy it from Pittman or did they go out of business?
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000] I bought it from Pittman Grocery Company.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000] Yeah.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000] Pittman operated. There were wholesalers. That was one of the unique parts about this half interest business.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000] I obtained my merchandise at broker's cost.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000] And I enjoyed the half of the profit between the broker's cost and the retail final sale.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000] Right.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000] Well, that's not bad.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:52.000] Since you've been here for such a long time, I imagine that you've met some pretty interesting people from Fitzgerald who have come in here at one time or another.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000] Do you recall any of them?
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000] Well, we've had a number of them. All customers are interesting to me.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000] I have lived in this county all my life.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000] And at one time I thought I knew everybody here.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:21.000] I learn now though that in my older age, I don't know nearly as many of them as I thought I did.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000] But I'm done.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000] Thank you.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000] Thank you.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000] I've done business with a number of people in the business that I've been in.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:38.000] Yeah. Somebody was telling me that there used to be a man here in Fitzgerald, a black preacher named C.A. Jackson.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000] Do you recall a man by that name? I think maybe they called him Slop.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000] Slop Jackson? Oh, yeah. I remember Slop Jackson.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000] As long as I can remember anything.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000] Ha, ha, ha.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000] He had a very unusual name.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000] He had a very unusual approach.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:06.000] When you approached Slop Jackson on the street or in the alley, you usually saw him in these alleys picking up buckets of slop for the hogs.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000] And when he got real near you, Slop Jackson would just stop and stand there and say,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000] Fine, and dandy myself, and I hope you're all right.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000] Ha, ha, ha.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000] Ha, ha, ha.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.000] We had another black man at the same time who was doing a similar business.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000] His name was Brown.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000] Everybody just knew him as Brown.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:42.000] And under the same circumstances, when you met Brown on the street, he stopped and his first word was,
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000] Good to be here.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000] So many done been here and gone on.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000] Ha, ha, ha.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000] That was just those two black men's approach to everybody, but they were well like both of them.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000] Both of them have been dead a number of years.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000] Is it true that Mr. Jackson was a writer of hymns in his time?
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000] I don't know about that.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000] Yeah, somebody mentioned that to me, and I haven't been able to confirm it anyway.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000] Yeah, I'm not, I'm not, I didn't know that.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000] He possibly did, but I don't know that.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000] Somebody told me that Little Richard, the rock and roll singer,
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000] came from Fitzgerald.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000] Do you know anything about that?
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000] I don't know him. Richard, do you know his last name?
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000] No, I don't, and I think he always went by Little Richard.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000] A fellow was telling me that he used to sing gospel music on the street corner,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000] and people would give him a little contribution.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000] I don't recall that.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000] Yeah.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000] He, his big time of popularity was in the 1950s.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000] Yeah.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000] In the 1950s or so.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000] Listen, if you have more to do, go ahead and I'll just...
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000] Well, let me switch over.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000] General practitioner.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000] This was Roy Dorminey's father who...
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000] Yeah, Dr. Bill was his father.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000] Yeah.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.000] Somebody was telling me that the Dorminey family had a fine big farm
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000] out on the Jacksonville Highway someplace,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000] and that most of the old buildings were,
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000] still in pretty good shape out there.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000] Is that right?
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000] There's some of them still there.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000] Most of them been torn down.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000] Yeah.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000] Are those buildings log or frame?
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000] They made out of logs?
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000] Part of them made out of logs, and part of them frame.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000] Huh. Yeah.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000] I'd sort of like to go out and have a look at that,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000] because one of the things I've been doing is taking pictures
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000] of some of the older buildings around.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000] Especially the log ones.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000] Is there anybody living out there now?
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:57.000] Well, there's two or three out there.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:10.000] But I don't know where to take you to go offhand to find the log house.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000] Isn't there one, Roy, back over after you cross off?
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000] I think there's one across Otter Creek,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000] below the John D. Dorminey place, and turn right.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000] I believe that the first house there, if I'm not mistaken,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000] is an old log house.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000] Bo Davis has a hog farm there now, just across the road from him.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000] I'm not sure, but I believe that one is logged.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000] That's the old Walt Dorminey farm.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000] Walt Dorminey farm?
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000] Yeah.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000] Yeah.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000] Is, uh, do you think Mr. Davis is the owner of,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000] uh, that log house now?
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000] No, no.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000] John is the owner over across the street here.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000] Who's that?
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000] John Dorminey across the street.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:02.000] But he, uh, Ray, Bo Davis operates as a, an associate with him.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000] And they raise hogs out there and farm.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000] Uh-huh.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:13.000] Uh, I was out there about a year ago, and they had about a thousand hogs
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000] on a feed parlor there.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000] Yeah.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000] That's, that's a lot of hogs for this part of the country, isn't it?
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000] Well, it was, it was, they made a pretty good flock of hogs.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000] Yeah.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000] Yeah.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000] You never bought enough to make a hamburger out of anyway, right?
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000] Yeah.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:35.000] I purchased, uh, ten of those gilts.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000] I was, I was figuring on getting into the hog production business.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000] And I went out there.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000] I heard that he had some, uh, some, uh, some, uh, some, uh, some, uh, some, uh, some, uh,
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000] I heard that he had some good-blooded hogs.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000] So, I went out and bought ten of those gilts off of that feed parlor.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:58.000] And, uh, we still have eight of them, I believe.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000] Yeah, you had them butchered and put them in the fridge.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000] No, uh, they're, uh, brood sows now.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000] Oh.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000] Uh, that, uh, my brother-in-law, Jim Collier, who was county extension man.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000] And they had four of them.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:20.540] man in this county, chose those hogs for me. He picked them out. He and I are in business
[00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:27.460] on in partnership with that. And he picked out those gilts and out of the gilts it was,
[00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:37.560] we had them bred or bred them. We bought a thoroughbred male and bred them. And we came
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:44.260] up with one that was sterile. We had nine good gilts and those nine, their first litter
[00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:57.700] of pigs brought 103, 103 live pigs. We lost, in the meantime, that was last year now, but
[00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:05.540] their second litter of pigs was born about the first of this year. And the eight of them
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.540] we had then brought nine good gilts.
[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.940] And they're 99 this time.
[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:11.940] That's a real high average.
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.940] Well, they're above the average.
[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:14.940] Yeah.
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:24.980] Now those sows now are in their bred and will start farrowing again in about three weeks.
[00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:32.160] And those sows will average 500 pounds apiece, but they're beautiful sows. That many and
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:37.520] all of them within, I'd say within 10 pounds of each other. There's not much variation
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.520] in size and weight.
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.520] You have some land outside of Fitzgerald where they are?
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:52.520] Yes. I have a farm out about five miles from the city limits southeast of here on the cemetery
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.520] road we call it.
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.520] The cemetery road?
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:55.520] Right.
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.520] That's where all those mysterious lights and one thing or another are?
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.520] That's where the population of Fitzgerald is going.
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.920] Well, when you get to the cemetery, you're going to see a lot of the same things.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:10.920] Well, when you have those pigs, do you sell them off when they're pretty young?
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:17.920] No. We feed them out to number ones. We're selling hogs now. We sold some last week.
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.920] That's number one is what? 220 to 240 in there?
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:29.480] Well, number one's actually considered from 180 to 240. But now we raise them to the top
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:36.920] level and last week's hogs averaged 222. That's what we like to give them.
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.920] Right. Where do you sell them?
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.920] We sell those at Fitzgerald on livestock auctions.
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.920] Yeah. That's the auctions on Thursdays, is that right?
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:48.920] Thursdays, right.
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.920] Yeah. What time is that auction? Do you know?
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:54.920] They start at 2 o'clock each Thursday. They'll be selling today.
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.920] I was thinking I might go down there.
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.920] Some nice people out there. You should go out.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:05.920] Yeah. The other day I was down talking to Uncle Guy Fuller at his place. You know him?
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:06.920] I sure do.
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:09.920] The country knows that man.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.920] Does he come in here?
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:20.920] Guy doesn't get around much. If he came to town, he'd come in here. All people that come to town come here.
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:27.920] Right. Do you recall anything about him?
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:35.920] Well, I've known Guy for all my life. He was very prominent and good.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:41.920] He was very prominent and good school teacher for a number of years. He's retired.
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:47.920] He was principal out at Ashton School, which is in this district that my farm is in.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:56.920] And Guy is a person lover. He likes everybody.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:04.920] And all the younger generation, he recognizes all ages of people.
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:16.920] And there's a bunch of boys around him all the time out at his lake. That's Oscewichee Creek.
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:22.920] Spring Lake Creek. That's Oscewichee Creek. Used to call it Spring Lake.
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:32.920] But Guy is a most likable person. He's somebody that everybody likes him.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.920] And they go out there and if they can keep off of rattlesnakes,
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.920] he'll entertain you.
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:41.920] Is he the... Do you think he kills all those snakes? I've heard he's...
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:45.920] I'm sure he does. I've seen so many of them.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:51.920] Two or three years ago, I was out there and he just killed one under his doorstep.
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.920] Under his doorstep? Under his doorstep.
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:57.920] He just walked over him and saw him crawl out and killed him.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.920] Rattlesnake? Rattlesnake, right.
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.920] All right.
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:03.920] Well, uh...
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.920] I guess he told me he doesn't like snakes one bit.
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.920] Well, he killed them.
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.920] Is that common around here?
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:16.920] Yes. There's quite a few rattlesnakes in the area that Guy Fuller lived in.
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:17.920] Yeah.
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.920] There's quite a... That's...
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.920] They've never been eradicated from there.
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:27.920] Now, rattlesnakes are becoming more prevalent in this area than they used to be.
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:33.920] Now, I know on my place, my grandfather bought that tree.
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.920] He owned that farm 100 years ago.
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.920] I own only a portion of it.
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:44.920] But when he bought that land, there was plenty of rattlesnakes on it.
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:47.920] It was in the wild.
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:59.920] But when I came along, as a child, I can remember my daddy killing the last rattlesnake that I heard of on that side of the creek.
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:03.920] And it had been, I guess, 40 years before there was another one coming.
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.920] But now in the last, uh...
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:09.920] I'd say in the last 10 or 12 years, they're getting to be right plentiful.
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:14.920] There's several killed on my place or right near it.
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:19.920] On some of that lot of land, every year, there's several killed. Big ones.
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.920] Yeah. I wonder why it is they're coming back like that.
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.920] The, uh...
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:30.920] My idea is that they're coming out of more than a hundred years ago.
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.920] I mean, they're coming back.
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.920] More heavily timbered areas where they're cutting the woods.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.920] They're moving.
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.920] And they hunt a place.
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:45.920] If you've got a place that has some trash and stuff in the woods, they go to it.
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.920] They find it.
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:54.920] And they have just naturally spread out more for some reason or other.
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:16:01.920] I think possibly maybe the absence of burning the woods regularly is what caused it most likely.
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:06.920] Used to, every farmer burned his land.
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:12.920] And he couldn't hardly wait till the time to burn that land off to get it cleaned up.
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:16.920] But now there's land that hadn't been burned in 15 years.
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:19.920] What was the point of burning the woods back then?
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.920] Make the grass come out so the cattle could graze.
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:23.920] Yeah. Yeah.
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.920] We didn't have permanent pastures then.
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.920] We had pastures in the wild.
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.920] And they'd burn them off.
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:31.920] And, uh...
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:35.920] Burn them off usually by the first of February.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:36.920] Right.
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.920] Any of those fires ever get away?
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.920] Well, they didn't have any wood to do it with.
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.920] You recall one?
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.920] They just burned some more land next to it.
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.920] It was in the same shape.
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:53.920] Now, was that wiregrass pastures they were burning?
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.920] Yes. Yes, it was wiregrass.
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.920] Knee deep in lots of places.
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:16:59.920] Uh...
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:00.920] But if you didn't burn it,
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:06.920] they did that to keep it from catching on fire and burning up their home or something, too.
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.920] They thought they had to burn it to protect it.
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.920] It was a fire protective action, actually.
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:16.920] I've heard this area referred to as Wiregrass, Georgia.
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:18.920] Used to be covered with it.
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:19.920] Yeah.
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:20.920] Because it was...
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:25.920] How far did the wiregrass extend beyond this region?
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:29.920] I mean, is that just a few counties around here that was the Wiregrass?
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:34.920] I believe Wiregrass extended to the Florida line, didn't it, Roy?
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:35.920] At least that far.
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:37.920] Maybe on into Florida.
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:38.920] It was just a...
[00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:42.920] Wiregrass is a type of grass that if you look at it,
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:47.920] you wouldn't think any animal would eat it or could thrive on it.
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:49.920] But when you burn that grass off now,
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.920] it gets to be about, I'd say, 12, 18 inches long.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.920] Got your whole family coming in the back.
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:57.920] The cats.
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:58.920] Uh...
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.920] One, two, three.
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:05.920] But the Wiregrass, if you burn it off, it grows back fast.
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:10.920] It'll grow a tender shoot of Wiregrass in a warm night.
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.920] It'll grow an inch.
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.920] And the cattle are very fond of it.
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.920] They'll go there, and as long as that Wiregrass is tender,
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.920] they'll eat it, and they'll gain weight on it, too.
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.920] It'll maintain you.
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:24.920] And the other thing,
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.920] the Wiregrass is a very good source of food for the cats.
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:27.920] They're very good.
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.920] And they're very good at getting you herds on Wiregrass.
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:32.920] And that's what they use then.
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:42.920] Now they have improved those pastures by planting bahia and bermudagrass.
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:46.920] But there's still plenty of Wiregrass areas,
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.920] but the carpetgrass has taken that over on my place,
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.920] and I assume it had on most places.
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:56.920] These buttergrasses are the ones that are more...
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.920] that have taken over this area.
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:01.920] Right.
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.920] Have taken over most of the Wiregrass, too.
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:04.920] Yeah.
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.920] I haven't seen any Wiregrass actually growing, I don't think.
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:08.920] Well, you should see some,
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:12.920] and you should go on a hill where there's some earthworms,
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.920] and you can...
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.920] I used to, as a child,
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:20.920] I'd pull out one of those tender Wiregrass blades,
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:23.920] and the tender end of it is very tender.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.920] And I'd brush the little potty,
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:31.920] little pods of dirt off of where an earthworm had worked it out.
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.920] You'd see a little hole in the ground,
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.920] and you'd stick that Wiregrass down in it,
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:36.920] and it'd begin to move,
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.920] and it'd move a little every time you'd touch something in it.
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.920] And if you'd look about within three feet,
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.920] you'd see a worm crawling out.
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:49.920] And I've seen them crawl out a foot and a half long of a hillworm.
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:54.920] However, a regular grassworm used to be only about six inches long,
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.920] but you'd run them out with those Wiregrass.
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.920] Yeah, yeah.
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.920] Was there a name for doing that?
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.920] No, they improved on that idea,
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.920] and they called it grunting worms a little later.
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:09.920] They would drive a stick in the ground
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:14.920] and take a brick or anything that would vibrate that piece of wood
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.920] and drive it down pretty close to the ground,
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:20.920] and then they'd rub it where that brick was the most common thing.
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.920] And worms would just crawl out all around.
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:24.920] You'd just pick them up.
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:25.920] Yeah.
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.920] Well, I was grunting worms for me yesterday,
[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.920] and we picked up a whole can of worms.
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:35.920] We had a person here whom we had, that I knew,
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:38.920] but has gone on to his reward,
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:43.920] that I'd say made a lot of money grunting worms.
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:44.920] Reeves?
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.920] Reeves, yeah.
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:48.920] Doc Reeves.
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.920] But he did it as an occupation.
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.920] He was a retired railroad man,
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.920] and he had a place about where he could grunt worms
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.920] and just get cans full of them.
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.920] You could go to his house any time
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.920] and get you several buckets of worms,
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.920] as many as you wanted.
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:04.920] He sold them for fish?
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.920] He sold them for fish bait.
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:07.920] Yeah.
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.920] Why did they call him Doc?
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:13.920] That was just a nickname.
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:15.920] It was a dog fish.
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:16.920] A dog fish, that's right.
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.920] That's where they got the dog from.
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:21.920] Yeah.
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:25.920] Did y'all ever hear any stories about Crystal Lake out here?
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.920] Yeah.
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.920] I've read some about it.
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.920] I've heard some, too.
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.920] Used to call it Bone Pond.
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:35.920] Yeah.
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:36.920] Bone Pond?
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:39.920] Was that named after somebody, or did it have bones in it?
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:40.920] I don't know about that.
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.920] Yeah, it was named after a fellow, Bone,
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.920] who ran a grits mill on the banks.
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:46.920] I was told that.
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.920] That was before my time.
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.920] But there's an old fable or a story going,
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:55.920] that I've heard that on a bright, sun-shiny day,
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.920] that you could see the old mill house
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:01.920] in the bottom of the deepest part of Crystal Lake,
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.920] where there's supposed to be no bottom to it.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.920] But I believe I've heard that that water
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:12.920] was approximately 190 feet deep there.
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:16.920] But I understand that Mr. Bone had a mill there,
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:21.920] and one morning he went down to do some corn growing,
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:25.920] and found his mill had sunk into Crystal Lake,
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:28.920] where it was known as Bone Pond then.
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:29.920] Is that right?
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.920] A big lime sink.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.920] That's all it is.
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:34.920] Uh-huh.
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:35.920] Do you know,
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:39.920] and so the idea is that the mill's just part of the bank?
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.920] I've never seen it,
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.920] but the story is that on bright days,
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.920] you can see part of it down there.
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.920] But the idea was that part of the sink had collapsed,
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.920] and the whole thing collapsed.
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.920] And the whole mill had just sunk right in.
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.920] It had just sunk into the lake.
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:56.920] Yeah.
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:00.920] Did you ever hear a story about somebody getting hung out there?
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:01.920] Yeah.
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.920] What was that about?
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:07.920] A Negro slave.
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:09.920] Was he hung or shot?
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:10.920] No, he was hung.
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.920] They found him with his hand out on the ground, you know.
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.920] He was buried alive.
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.920] He was buried alive, and his hand was sticking out.
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:18.920] The one that I know about,
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:21.920] I read this in the history of Irwin County.
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:22.920] Yeah.
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.920] One of those books,
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.920] History of Irwin County,
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:29.920] by J.B. Clemens.
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.920] J.B. Clemens.
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.920] His brother married J.B. Clemens' daughter.
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.920] Isn't that right?
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.920] Hmm.
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.920] Well, what we're interested in
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.920] is not so much the facts of history
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.920] as the kinds of stories and legends
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.920] that are current in a particular area.
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.920] And it seems like Crystal Lake has a bunch of legends around.
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:57.920] Irwin County has a tremendous amount of
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:59.920] good and bad history behind it.
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.920] It's a very noted county.
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:05.920] Is that the old Irwin County that was so big?
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:06.920] Yes.
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.920] Irwin County at one time,
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:13.920] I believe I'm right in stating that it reached
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.920] from the Flint River to the Satilla.
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:19.920] Covered all of the area between the two rivers.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.920] About a third of the state of Georgia.
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.920] For political reasons then,
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:28.920] they changed these boundaries and created a new county.
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.920] That's how Bend Hill County came into existence.
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:35.920] Controversy or...
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.920] Hey, Mr. Homer.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:41.920] Something had a political background anyway.
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:43.920] Uh-huh.
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:44.920] Morning.
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:45.920] All right.
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.920] What you got there?
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:48.920] Oh, a tape recorder.
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:53.920] We're finding out something about the early history of this area.
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.920] David, meet Mr. Phillips.
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:56.920] Homer Phillips.
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:57.920] Mr. Phillips, nice to meet you.
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.920] Good to meet you.
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.920] Let's see.
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:02.920] Am I...
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.920] I don't want to be in the way if Mr. Phillips wants to sit down.
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:08.920] Oh, Mr. Phillips wants to buy some chicken feet for you.
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:09.920] Yeah, all right.
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.920] Get those chickens.
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:12.920] Go ahead.
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:16.920] Were you going to say something about the bad history of Irwin County?
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:17.920] Good and bad?
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:18.920] Good and bad.
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:19.920] A lot of...
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:21.920] You remember old man Bostick, you know,
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.920] killed them people out there the other side of Irwinville
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:28.920] out there at the time, about his wife.
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.920] What was that about?
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:33.920] Dispute somewhere, a family dispute.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:34.920] His name was...
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:35.920] Bostick.
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:36.920] Bostick.
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:40.920] How many did he kill out there, Roy?
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:45.920] Well, he killed Todd McInnis, the first one.
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.920] He was deputy sheriff.
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:51.920] I think he killed a couple more, Ed.
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:58.920] He barricaded himself in one of those log cabins that you were talking about.
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:01.920] He just wouldn't come out.
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:04.920] What'd they finally do about him?
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:10.920] They killed him, right?
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.920] Yeah, shot him right there in the house.
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.920] Right through the walls, huh?
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:16.920] Yeah.
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:24.920] He had a saw from a saw mill, one of these circle saws.
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.920] One of those big circular saws?
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:30.920] Yeah, and he put it up against the inside of the front door,
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:33.920] and he was behind it.
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:39.920] Ordinary gun didn't have a chance in the world.
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:44.920] But he stuck his head up over the top of it for some cause or another,
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:48.920] and somebody let him have it.
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:52.920] How long ago was that?
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:59.920] I'd say around 1900.
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:04.920] By the same time.
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:09.920] You get you a copy of that history of Irving County,
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.920] there's a complete write-up in there about it.
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:15.920] There you're about to hear.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:24.920] What was that about that tobacco box up there on the ceiling?
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:27.920] Well, you notice that light streak up over that twine,
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:30.920] where the twine comes out of that box and on across,
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:33.920] runs some three or four feet up there.
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:38.920] And that light streak on that ceiling is caused by the shadow from this light over here,
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:41.920] shining on that string where there's paint off the ceiling.
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:48.920] Apparently, that light is that light on all three sides
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:52.920] creating theniciety for eligibility for Fairfield to come on it.
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.920] Yeody.
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:28:00.880] Dist radish,
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:09.060] fans say that weНАЯ
[00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:11.680] Snait radado.
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:12.880] You know what I got, some carb site lots.
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:23.120] that you just take them up on the wall. I remember. Carbide. You put
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:34.260] carbide in and it generates a gas. Then you light it. It had a reflector and all.
[00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:47.820] I got four of them. That's Ivy Brady. Mr. Brady? And this is Mrs. Brady here.
[00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:57.500] Mrs. Brady? Well, eventually it's going to go up to the Library of Congress in
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:04.060] Washington and they'll be putting the library up there. We're studying the
[00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:04.160] library.
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:04.240] We're studying the library.
[00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:04.480] We're studying the library.
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:04.500] We're studying the library.
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:04.520] We're studying the library.
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:04.560] We're studying the library.
[00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:07.100] Traditional life and work in this area.
[00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:18.080] I was just asking, have you heard any other stories about Crystal Lake out there?
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:23.120] Besides that one about the gristmill going down and being bottomless?
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:32.300] I don't recall any other than now this.
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:43.040] we talked a little about this killing out there and about this black man who was found buried
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:47.940] alive now the reason they knew he was buried alive he had one hand out of the mud but that
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:56.000] was over behind crystal lake you remember roy but it was near crystal lake but he had worked his
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:03.080] hand out trying to come out of that mud and was found that way what had he done to be buried alive
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:11.520] I don't know he and his whoever killed him I don't remember I read that in this history of
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:17.060] where we in County it relates the whole story in there and you may you can get that at the library
[00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:25.940] I used to hear tell you all that crystal lake went dry
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.580] every seven years but I've never known of that now there's other lakes in that area that goes
[00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:39.320] dry one of them dry right now raw Ross lake is real close to crystal lake and there's another
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:48.680] one on this new road going up to Ashburn that's name Coleman pond and it goes dry people used to
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:55.240] say that went dry every seven years but that just made a good story they go dry when when the
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:55.800] weather gets dry you can see those two things that's the big one the one that went dry and the
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:55.980] other one that went dry and the other one that went dry and the other one that went dry and the
[00:30:55.980 --> 00:31:03.100] enough that it drops the level of the water level in the area that water runs out.
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:09.780] The explanation that I had rather believe about it is that the Alappey Hall River runs
[00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:15.820] underground in a good portion of south Georgia.
[00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:20.300] And where these lakes are, you don't see the Alappey Hall River.
[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:26.300] You can see the course of it, but it takes real wet weather for it to ever run at all
[00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:28.980] across the top of the land.
[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:35.980] I have, I used to do quite a bit of flying, and I have flown over the Alappey Hall River
[00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:36.800] from here to the...
