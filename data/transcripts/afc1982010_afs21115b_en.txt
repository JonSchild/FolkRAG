[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.340] I will call you friends. I'm calling you friends now before I leave.
[00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:20.760] Friends, my function is to say a sincere thank you very much to you.
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.940] I've now been in your country for a few days.
[00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.940] Tomorrow I'm leaving your country.
[00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:42.940] It is not easy in such a short time to learn a great deal about a large country like your country.
[00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.940] But it is enough that short a time I've been in your country.
[00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:52.940] It's enough
[00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:05.940] to make me and my colleagues to leave your country with immense hope.
[00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.940] Your country is very powerful.
[00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.940] And sometimes we fear your country.
[00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.940] I first visited your country.
[00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:31.940] Officially in 1963 I was invited by President Kennedy.
[00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.940] I came to discuss Southern Africa.
[00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.940] I left greatly encouraged.
[00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.940] I'm back. This time this is a state visit.
[00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:58.940] But it is a different kind of state visit from the state visits I've been paying in other countries.
[00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.940] It is a business state visit.
[00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:10.940] I'm still here to seek the assistance of your government
[00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.940] and the American people on our problems in Southern Africa.
[00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.940] I leave that there.
[00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.940] We have problems of liberation and I continue and I've been talking about them.
[00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.940] But we don't want liberation for the sake of liberation.
[00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.940] We don't simply want to get to govern our countries
[00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.940] merely for the sake of putting up a flag
[00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.940] and having a national anthem
[00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.940] and having a seat in the United Nations.
[00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:49.940] It does happen that my country is the United Republic of Tanzania
[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.940] and yours is the United States.
[00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:59.940] And I think we have the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom.
[00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.940] At the United Nations we sit very close
[00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.940] because the seats are arranged in alphabetical order.
[00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:08.940] So we sit very close.
[00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.940] And theoretically we are equal.
[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:13.940] But you know we are not.
[00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.940] So I say we've been talking about our problems of liberation in Southern Africa.
[00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:24.940] But we have other problems.
[00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:26.940] These are the problems you've been talking about.
[00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:28.940] The problems of development.
[00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:30.940] Professor I do agree with you.
[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:32.940] Everything that you've said.
[00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.940] We have to increase our productivity.
[00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:37.940] We have to use modern technology.
[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:39.940] We have to use modern science.
[00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:41.940] We have to get into our own people.
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:43.940] We have to encourage our people.
[00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:45.940] If people work, and this is what we talk about, exploitation.
[00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:47.940] I agree with you.
[00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:49.940] If people are going to work,
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.940] they must work knowing that they are going to reap the benefits of their work.
[00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.940] They shouldn't work like a bunch of slaves.
[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:00.940] They should work for themselves.
[00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.940] They should know that they are working for their own good.
[00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:05.940] I agree.
[00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:07.940] You can't work without...
[00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:09.940] Without those incentives.
[00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.940] So Professor I agree with everything you say and that's why I'm here.
[00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.940] I'm here learning how, how, what do you do in raising peanuts.
[00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:20.940] We grow peanuts.
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:22.940] We call them groundnuts.
[00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:24.940] We love them.
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:26.940] I eat them raw.
[00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:28.940] I eat peanuts as you eat candy.
[00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.940] I can eat a whole bowl of raw peanuts.
[00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.940] It's a dangerous thing putting a bowl of raw peanuts before me.
[00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:37.940] I eat them all, raw.
[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.940] And if I'm in the field of peanuts, I don't know how you pull them out.
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.940] I stamp down on the vine and then pull them out.
[00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:49.940] Then I eat them after that.
[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.940] But our productivity is not very good.
[00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:54.940] It's very poor.
[00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:01.940] So we have these problems of increasing the productivity of the farm.
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.940] These are problems we have and we know them.
[00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:12.940] But Professor we have another problem and I believe it is the biggest problem now facing
[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:14.940] the poor countries.
[00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:25.940] It's an internal problem of raising productivity with the internal problem of the system.
[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.940] That is people are working.
[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:35.940] They are not being exploited by a small minority.
[00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.940] And in too many of our poor countries, the poor countries of the third world, the people
[00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:42.940] work.
[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.940] And some have succeeded in raising productivity.
[00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.940] But the benefit goes to a ruling elite, a small ruling elite.
[00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.940] The benefits don't go to the masses of the people.
[00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:56.940] That's an internal problem.
[00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.940] This is my problem.
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.940] The problem of raising productivity in Tanzania is mine.
[00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.940] The problem of seeing that what is produced goes to the masses of the people is mine.
[00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:10.940] But there is another problem.
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:12.940] This is the problem of the world.
[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:14.940] It's the system of the world.
[00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.940] I don't make my own tractors in Tanzania.
[00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.940] I'm going to buy tractors from here.
[00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.940] I must increase my productivity.
[00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:43.940] But I find that because the price of your tractors is going up and up and up, and I'm
[00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.940] not very sure of the price of my sisal or my cotton.
[00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:55.940] I have to sell more and more tons of cotton.
[00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:06.940] I have to buy tons of sisal every year to buy the same type of tractor every year.
[00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.940] I can do this if the productivity is less.
[00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:14.940] I can do this by expanding acreage.
[00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:18.940] If the productivity per acre is good, fine.
[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.940] I can produce more cotton per acre.
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.940] More cotton per hectare.
[00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:29.940] But more and more in order to buy the same tractor.
[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.940] This I can't do anything about.
[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:34.940] This is the system.
[00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:36.940] This is the world system.
[00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.940] This has to be tackled internationally.
[00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:47.940] And that's where the industrialized countries must help us.
[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:53.940] We are going to work hard to increase our knowledge, to increase our productivity.
[00:07:53.940 --> 00:08:00.940] We are going to work hard in some of our own countries to change the exploitative system
[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:05.940] in the country so that if our people work, they reap the benefits of their work.
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.940] But the international system, I can do very little.
[00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:11.940] That's one.
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:12.940] I gave the example of the tractor.
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:15.940] And you are right, Professor, that it's no use.
[00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:22.940] It's better for me to export textiles rather than raw cotton.
[00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.940] I will improve the value to our farm.
[00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:31.940] I will improve the value of their product if I can process it before I sell it.
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:46.940] But the industrialized countries will not let us sell our textiles to them.
[00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:50.940] They will have tariff barriers.
[00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.940] And if they don't have tariff barriers,
[00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:54.940] they will have quota barriers.
[00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:56.940] Why?
[00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:05.940] They say because wages are lower in our countries than they are in their countries.
[00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:08.940] This is shorted labor.
[00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:17.940] But the wages in the textile factory in Tanzania are higher
[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:23.940] than the price which I give to the peasant.
[00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:35.940] The textile worker is privileged compared to the peasant who produces cotton.
[00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.940] But the cotton I can sell to you, no problem.
[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:44.940] But if I try to sell textiles to them, they say, no, no, no, this is shorted labor.
[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:45.940] They are protecting their labor.
[00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:51.940] They are protecting the industrialized countries are protecting their markets.
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:53.940] These are the biggest markets.
[00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:56.940] They would rather buy my cotton.
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.940] They would rather buy my fiber.
[00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:03.940] But the moment I begin to sell textiles, I have barriers.
[00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:12.940] The moment I begin to sell rope or fiber or twine, I am in trouble, including the United States.
[00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:14.940] I find it much more difficult to sell twine here.
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.940] So, professor, there are problems which are Tanzania problems,
[00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:21.940] and I am going to handle them with the help of my professor there.
[00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.940] I am going to try and handle those internal problems.
[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:29.940] And with the help of friends like you here, I bring students here.
[00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:30.940] They come.
[00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:36.940] The minister says he brought only 16 this year, 16,000 students.
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:37.940] 18.
[00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.940] You should bring 1,800.
[00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.940] Not 80.
[00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:43.940] I bring large numbers of students.
[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:44.940] If you can allow me, I'll bring those.
[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.940] I want large numbers of students to come and learn, and then take your knowledge back,
[00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.940] and we'll increase our productivity.
[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:56.940] But even when we have solved the internal problems of productivity, of justice within Tanzania,
[00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:00.940] the problem of justice internationally will remain.
[00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:02.940] And there you can help.
[00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.940] And I believe you are going to help us on both levels.
[00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:13.940] Friends, once again, I thank you very much for your hospitality and for your understanding of our problems.
[00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:14.940] Thank you.
[00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:24.940] .
[00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:34.940] .
[00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:38.940] .
[00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:43.940] The word of response and to make the presentation, Alice Brown, Chairman of the Kempton City Commission.
[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:54.660] Mr. President, members of your delegation, we are enjoying your visit and we sincerely
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:12:00.420] hope that you are enjoying your visit to our city and to our county.
[00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:04.900] This may not be the biggest city that you've visited since you've been in America, but
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:10.660] I can assure you that I hope when you leave that you will say that this is a friendliest
[00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:11.660] city.
[00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:18.780] And on behalf of the city of Tifton, I would like for you to come forward and I'd like
[00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:26.220] to present to you the key to our city, symbolic of our friendship to you and your people.
[00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:31.180] On this key is the name of the friendliest city and we hope that you will remember us
[00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.180] and come back to see us.
[00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:50.140] For our closing remarks and the benediction we will call on our own Congressman, Congressman
[00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:51.140] Dawson Matz.
[00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:52.140] Let us pray.
[00:12:52.140 --> 00:13:04.700] Our Father, we thank you for this day, for this opportunity for friendship, for the exchange
[00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:09.780] of ideas and ideals here today.
[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:10.780] We thank you for men and women of color, for the people of our country, for the people
[00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:10.820] of our country.
[00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:15.900] We thank you for men and women of vision and leadership, no matter what their race,
[00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:19.740] their creed, their national origin.
[00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:26.500] And as we leave this place, give us understanding that we are all God's children in this world
[00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.100] he has made.
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:36.420] Make us aware that the brotherhood of man transcends the sovereignty of nations and
[00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.420] guide us always toward peace.
[00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:41.420] Amen.
