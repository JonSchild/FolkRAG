[00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:09.220] Some lovers like the summertime when they stroll about, and courting in the meadows may be found without a doubt.
[00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:17.380] But give to me the wintertime for the girl that I love best was captured while the snow was on the ground.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:24.460] I traced her little footprints in the snow. I traced her little footprints in the snow.
[00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:32.500] I blessed that happy day when Lily lost her way. I traced her little footprints in the snow.
[00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:42.440] I went to see this girl of mine one winter afternoon. She had gone out walking, they informed me very soon.
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:50.800] They said she'd strolled away to where they could not say. So I started out to find her in the snow.
[00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.440] I traced her little footprints in the snow.
[00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:02.460] I traced her little footprints in the snow. I blessed that happy day when Lily lost her way.
[00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.960] I traced her little footprints in the snow.
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:15.860] I asked this lovely girl of mine as we were walking home, and she promised that she never from me would ever roam.
[00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:24.200] I live a happy life with the girl I made my wife. I won her when the snow was on the ground.
[00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:31.460] I traced her little footprints in the snow. I traced her little footprints in the snow.
[00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:39.460] I'll never forget the day when Lily lost her way. I traced her little footprints in the snow.
