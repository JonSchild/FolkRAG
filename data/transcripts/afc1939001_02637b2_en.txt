[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.660] Oh, where have you been, Billy boy, Billy boy? Oh, where have you been, charming Billy?
[00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:19.480] I've been to speak of why she's a joy of my life. She's a young, singing, cannot-leave mother.
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:30.140] Did she bid you come in, Billy boy, Billy boy? Did she bid you come in, charming Billy?
[00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:40.180] Yes, she bid me come in with a dimple in her chin. She's a young, singing, cannot-leave mother.
[00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:49.240] Did she go for you a chair, Billy boy, Billy boy? Did she set for you a chair,
[00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.460] charming Billy boy? Did she go for you a chair, charming Billy boy?
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:56.560] Yes, she set for me a chair. She had ringlets in her hair.
[00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:07.020] She's a young, singing, cannot-leave mother. Can she bake a cherry pie, Billy boy, Billy boy?
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:16.640] Can she bake a cherry pie, charming Billy? She can bake a cherry pie, which is a cat can wink her eye.
[00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.380] She's a young, singing, cannot-leave mother.
[00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.860] She's a young, singing, cannot-leave mother.
[00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:30.620] How old is she, Billy boy, Billy boy? How old is she, Billy boy, Billy boy?
