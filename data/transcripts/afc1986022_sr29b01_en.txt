[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.080] This is the CalNEH American English Dialect Recordings Collection, tape number 29, side B.
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:35.240] I was born up in the Nass Valley, in the old village what they call Kitlachtamiks, which they now, they called New Ayanch,
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.080] but after the flood they have a new village now.
[00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.880] They moved across.
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.760] They moved across the river and that's New Ayanch now.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.760] So I come from the Nishka tribe.
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.760] When did you come down to work in the cannery?
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.760] Oh goodness, my mother always did travel back and forth, you know.
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:09.700] Like I said, she worked on nets and she worked for Jade's Todd and Sons and so we used to leave up the Nass there around
[00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.700] March.
[00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.080] March.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:18.760] And then go down to Inverness and she'd start in April.
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:26.760] So I spent more time on the Skeena River than I did up in the Nass Valley.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.760] How did you come down?
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:40.700] Well, in those days when I was a young girl, we used to go by sled, you know, from Ayanch.
[00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:48.380] And then we'd use canoes down to wherever, where the ice would be.
[00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.380] And then they'd draw these canoes up on the ice.
[00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.380] And then they'd use dog teams sometimes, you know.
[00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.380] The people would pull and we'd have all our supplies on there.
[00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.380] And then we'd go right down to what they call Fishery Bay.
[00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.380] That's where they get Oolkans now, you know.
[00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.380] In those days they still did at that time.
[00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.380] And then from there we would get a boat.
[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.380] My mother would hire a boat to take us down to King Colith.
[00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.380] And then we'd stay overnight there.
[00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:30.380] And then she'd hire a boat from King Colith that would take us over to old Arendale Canterbury.
[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:40.320] And then from there we would catch either the Kamosh and the Cardina or the Catella down to Prince Rupert.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.320] Or right by Inverness there.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.320] And that's how they worked it.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.320] And my dude was pretty cold in those days too.
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.320] Yeah.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.320] So.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:02.320] Well that's the way the people traveled in those days, you know.
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.320] As far back as I could remember.
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.320] I don't know about the earlier days before the steamers again.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.320] I don't know about the earlier days before the steamers again.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.320] I don't know about the earlier days before the steamers again.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.320] I guess they used canoes.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:17.320] But at the time when I was growing up that's what we used to do.
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:24.320] So and then my mother would start around in April and work on nets there at Inverness.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.320] Who owned Inverness?
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.320] Well I couldn't say who owned it.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.320] Well they were taught.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.320] Taught people.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.320] They owned the cannery.
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.320] That's why.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.320] And before that I don't know who owned the place.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.320] Because I couldn't remember that far back, you know.
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:55.320] Because they did say that somebody else had it before.
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.320] Jates, Todd and Sons bought it, you see.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:08.320] So from that time on it was always Jates, Todd and Sons until they sold out to Canadian.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.320] I mean I can't remember if it was the same way, maybe even the same way.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.320] But people had their own canoes.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.320] So the canoes were sold to Canadian fish.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:18.320] Did you used to help your mother when you first went down?
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.320] Well that's how I learned how to work on nets.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.320] Is helping my mother, you know.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.320] I used to in those days they had linen nets.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:35.320] And I used to salvage them, you know, put salvaging on them.
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.320] And those nets then were oiled, you know.
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:46.100] you know. And at that time there was nets, well women, Japanese women, whoever lived at the
[00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:55.740] cannery there used to take contracts and they'd contract salvaging nets. And I can remember I
[00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:05.720] was really young and I used to make my own needles and the cannery crew, you know, took pity on me. I
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:12.360] guess they used to dash up and have their lunch and be back down in the netl out there and half
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:19.700] an hour they'd be all sitting there helping me fill needles. And after supper, you know, they
[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:27.620] would come down to our house and help me fill needles. And I used to have about 50 needles.
[00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:34.940] Because when you're working on a contract, you know, you can't waste time. If you were fast,
[00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:35.700] you get more work. You can't waste time. And I used to have about 60 needles. And when you were
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:42.360] nets you know if you're slow then you lose out on nets because there's a lot of people taking
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:52.420] contracts in those days what do you mean by filled needles they have needles you know and net needles
[00:05:52.420 --> 00:06:00.180] you have to fill them with twine that we use to salvage nets you know so I used to get a lot of
[00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:08.520] help that how old were you oh gosh I was well actually I must have started around when I was
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:16.740] nine years old salvaging but then I still worked I worked in the cannery when I was ten years of age
[00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:27.120] I started then well we used to pile cans and trays you know get cans open these cans and have them
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.360] ready for the hand fillers
[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:46.020] and I used to work on that and at that time I was getting 15 cents an hour all hours there was no overtime pay it was straight 15 cents an hour
[00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:57.780] and I can remember when the season was over I used to be so proud $70 I would clear
[00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.020] and that was big money in those days
[00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:15.180] when I was gone yeah of course everything like I said you know everything was cheap and my mother she used to get $75 a month that's
[00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:25.680] net worth but then they raised it later on to 85 and that was the rate up along the schema here the
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.780] ones that had more seniority
[00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:45.180] you know they used to get 85 but then it depended on how fast you worked you know if you were a fast hanger net hanger well you would get $85 a month and the
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:58.180] beginners they used to get $75 it depended on the net boss if he thought that the person was capable of doing this while the starting rate was 75
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:59.180] and that was the rate up along the schema here the ones that had more seniority
[00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:01.180] would also get $75 and that was the rate up along the schema here the ones that had more seniority
[00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:02.180] but then that was way before the union
[00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:04.180] A lot of people stopped because the union used to be a little closed-off
[00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.180] were there a lot of children around your age then?
[00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:08.180] Lots of kids
[00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:14.180] Oh yes they were a lot of them they used to they used to use children to work piling cans
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:24.180] and trays you know that was that it was more or less like play to the young kids you know as long as they were getting money
[00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:28.180] for it they enjoyed it but and then two, there were a very bunch of times when we lost that kind of money
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.180] that was more like extra cash from somewhere to get paid but that's all I could do.
[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:29.580] yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I lived with it, resourced,
[00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:32.580] bunch of tired little kids like myself.
[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.580] Yeah.
[00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:41.580] But that was money in those days.
[00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:45.580] So there's quite a difference now.
[00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:49.580] I often tell my own children that, my goodness,
[00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.580] at the rate of pain that beginners get now,
[00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.580] whether you know how to do it or not,
[00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:58.580] you can, I think in the earlier days it was
[00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.580] harder to get work.
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:05.580] You had to know how to do the job.
[00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.580] And nobody paid for you to learn.
[00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:12.580] You just have to get out there and learn on your own.
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:15.580] Now things are a lot different now.
[00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:19.580] As I see it, I don't know how other people would see it,
[00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.580] but I've lived it and that's why I know.
[00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:28.580] Like, see, all you have to do now is go to the UIC
[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:36.580] and then they tell you to go to this,
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.580] oh, what you call that.
[00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:42.580] And they find a job for you and then they pay you
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.580] while you're learning.
[00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:51.580] So that's a lot of difference than in my time.
[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.580] Was your father fishing?
[00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:57.580] No, my father was never a fisherman.
[00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:58.580] He was a fisherman.
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.580] He was a bookkeeper.
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:06.580] So, well, I didn't see too much of,
[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:10.580] I don't really remember my own parents seeing it
[00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:15.580] because they both died after I was born.
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:22.580] So, my own mother apparently was a net woman too, you know.
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.580] But the one that I call mother was the one that actually
[00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:27.580] brought me up, you know.
[00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:35.580] So, like, I more or less called her mother all the time.
[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:41.580] So in the days when I was growing up, you know,
[00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:47.580] she taught me how to hang nets and taught me a lot of things
[00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.580] about net work.
[00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:52.580] The fishermen would bring their nets in with a big rip in it?
[00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:56.580] Yeah, during the weekend.
[00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:03.580] And at that time too, that was all, there was no time,
[00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:07.580] no overtime, straight through.
[00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.580] All you had to do was dash home, have your lunch,
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.580] and then you'd go back to work again.
[00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.580] But now there's a difference.
[00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:22.580] Now you can go if they give you half an hour, you get half an hour,
[00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:25.580] and then you'll go home half an hour earlier.
[00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:31.580] And then if you are called back to work, you get overtime rate,
[00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:35.580] which I think is very good.
[00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:43.580] And not, you know, people are far better off now, I think.
[00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:47.580] Well, I'm not thinking it, I know they're far better off now
[00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:51.580] than they were when I was growing up.
[00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:54.580] But then too, like I was saying earlier, you know,
[00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:59.580] looking back on it, we didn't know any better in those days anyway,
[00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:01.580] and so we were happy with what we were getting.
[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.580] Everything was cheap, you know.
[00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:08.580] You work in the cannery, you didn't get that much money
[00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:11.580] in the pocket when the season is over.
[00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.580] But then everything was cheap.
[00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:17.580] Clothes were cheap, food was cheap.
[00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:21.580] So all in all, everybody was happy.
[00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:23.580] But then now, it's...
[00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:28.580] Today, you see, there is a difference the more we make.
[00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:35.580] You see, the more we want to buy,
[00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:40.580] and we want to get everything nice for our homes,
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:45.580] which people couldn't afford when I was a child.
[00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:53.580] So I don't know whether we're happier today than we were in those days.
[00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.580] Did everybody have powerboats?
[00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:58.580] Or were there still some people sailing?
[00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:04.580] Oh, at the time when I was a child, there was sailboats, you know.
[00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:09.580] And I can remember standing on the dock.
[00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:11.580] It impressed me so much.
[00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:13.580] I often think about this now.
[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.580] How beautiful it was to me.
[00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:18.580] That's through the eyes of a young girl, you know.
[00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:22.580] But just imagine.
[00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:24.580] From the Skeena here.
[00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:30.580] Now you see how wide the Skeena is and how far it is.
[00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:33.580] And way outside there.
[00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:37.580] And I can remember at Inverness there, you know,
[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:46.580] we'd see this packer with maybe 12, 20 sailboats in tow.
[00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.580] And they'd drift through the river here, you know,
[00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:52.580] from the canneries up above here perhaps.
[00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:57.580] At that time, I don't, I can't remember which company,
[00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:59.580] but they have their own flags.
[00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:06.580] And one thing that used to get us excited,
[00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:10.580] all the kids, we'd all run down by the wharf
[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:18.580] and see this boat, this packer, come along with the sailboats in tow.
[00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:21.580] And I can remember there was an accordion playing.
[00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:24.580] And one of the boats.
[00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:27.580] And he was playing My Blue Heaven.
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:31.580] And did that ever sound good.
[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:35.580] And we sat there on the dock listening to it.
[00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:39.580] You often heard this on any of these sailboats.
[00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.580] They take out their instruments.
[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:46.580] And I imagine during their time, you know,
[00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:48.580] when they're resting and drifting,
[00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:50.580] I guess they would, you know,
[00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:52.580] pass the time away, they would play it.
[00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:55.580] But I thought that was the most beautiful sound,
[00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:57.580] even today, you know.
[00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:02.580] I often think of that, how beautiful it sounded.
[00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:08.580] And you see, see, there's a boat from Sunnyside, a packer.
[00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:11.580] They would tow all their sailboats,
[00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:15.580] a boat from Cashier and from North Pacific here.
[00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:18.580] And then J.H. Todd would do the same thing.
[00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:20.580] And all the, they let it.
[00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:24.580] They let the sailboats go outside here, you know.
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:26.580] And then they go and row.
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:30.580] Now, imagine those people, those men rowing.
[00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.580] And all they had in these sailboats was tent.
[00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:38.580] And the weather up here is now not that pleasant all the time, you know.
[00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:42.580] And it was a tough life.
[00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:45.580] But then I think they were happy.
[00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:49.580] Because when they come in, they get all towed back on Fridays.
[00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:53.580] At the time, you know, when you fished five days a week at that time,
[00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:56.580] there was plenty of fish.
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:59.580] And they'd all tie up.
[00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:03.580] And they used to have a whale of a time, you know.
[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:08.580] I never did once hear them, you know, kick about their life.
[00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:10.580] It's how many fish they caught.
[00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:13.580] That's all they talked about.
[00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:16.580] What sort of things would go on on the weekends when they were here?
[00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:18.580] Well, at that time, I can remember,
[00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:21.580] I was growing up at that time, you know.
[00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:29.580] I can remember, you know, they used to hold dances.
[00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:34.580] They never used to go to Rupert, Prince Rupert, on the weekends.
[00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:39.580] They used to have Port Essington was the town in those days.
[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:44.580] I can remember 1st of July, all the people along this guinea here
[00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.580] would go to Port Essington.
[00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:48.580] They'd have races.
[00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:51.580] They'd have some canoe races.
[00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:59.580] And then they'd have a big bang-up dance in the old hall there.
[00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:04.580] And while talking about on weekends at the canneries,
[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:10.580] you see that the management used to put up dances for their own fishermen
[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:13.580] and the people that worked at the canneries.
[00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:17.580] I remember they used to have one at NP here.
[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:20.580] And we used to walk from Inverness on the track, mind you.
[00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:22.580] There was no highway there.
[00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:25.580] Sometimes a boat would bring us up here,
[00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:28.580] and we'd have a whale of a time, you know.
[00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:32.580] And there would be a dance as far as Carlisle and Claxton.
[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.580] People would go up there.
[00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:39.580] You know, the company would run their pack to bring people back and forth.
[00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:45.580] So they had a lot to do, you know, to keep them occupied and happy.
[00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:46.580] What kind of music was it?
[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:51.580] Well, they did have jazz now.
[00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:58.580] They did have their own jazz and some of these songs, like I would say.
[00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:02.580] Now, this is my own opinion, but I still prefer those old songs
[00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:05.580] than I do to all this screaming and yelling, you know,
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:08.580] and these new songs today.
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.580] Of course, there's some good ones that come out.
[00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:12.580] What kind of instruments would they have?
[00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:15.580] Well, they have the same instruments which they use today.
[00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:16.580] Yeah.
[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:17.580] They had guitars.
[00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:19.580] They had saxophones.
[00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:22.580] They had trumpets, and they had drums.
[00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:25.580] Oh, yes, about the same thing.
[00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:29.580] But I still like the old songs.
[00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:37.580] I think they are more romantic kind of songs, you know,
[00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:40.580] and they were beautiful.
[00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:45.580] And I sure like to hear a lot of them come back.
[00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:50.580] I often notice they are, you know, some of them are coming back.
[00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.580] But I believe in these waltzes, you know.
[00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:58.580] I really like that, especially, you know, when I was a teenager then, you know,
[00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:03.580] I guess I was around going on to 15 and 16.
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:09.580] And you would never go to a dance without an evening gown.
[00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:14.580] And these nice high-heeled shoes, you know, the women looked beautiful.
[00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:15.580] I always thought that.
[00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:17.580] They looked really beautiful.
[00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:21.580] The kind of shoes now, those ugly looking wedgies they use.
[00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:28.580] No, I really thought that that was beautiful.
[00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:32.580] And it's gradually coming back again now.
[00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:39.580] But there's a lot of things, you know, that I often think back and I remember.
[00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:43.580] But mind you, there was a lot of hard times too.
[00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:52.580] But I think in those days, I can't remember any time where, you know,
[00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:57.580] there was any conflict amongst people, really, you know.
[00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:01.580] What did the cannery sound like?
[00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:09.580] What sort of, were you working inside in the mending nets or were you outside?
[00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:12.580] Well, for mending nets, you see, you have a separate building.
[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:13.580] Right.
[00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:14.580] Where you work.
[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:23.580] So there's no sound, just the sound of a, you know, when you're pulling the line.
[00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:25.580] That's about the only sound there is.
[00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:29.580] But working in the cannery, see, I worked both.
[00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.580] I started from the cannery, of course.
[00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:36.580] I worked with my mother, you know, helping her in the net loft.
[00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:38.580] But then I worked in the cannery.
[00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:40.580] And mind you, there's a lot of noise.
[00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:42.580] There's more noise in the cannery.
[00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:48.580] There's steam there and the machinery going, you know, clang, clang, clang.
[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:56.580] And so you get all that noise all the time.
[00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:58.580] Who worked inside the canneries?
[00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:00.580] All women?
[00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:03.580] Well, women, hand filling in those days.
[00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:05.580] So there was more women.
[00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:11.580] And of course they had a lot of men.
[00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:17.580] That's pitching fish and the cannery workers that look after the machines.
[00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:24.580] And so there was quite a few people working in the canneries.
[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:30.580] But then there was more work.
[00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.580] See, now there's less work.
[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:36.580] Because every year, you know, there's conservation.
[00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:40.580] And along the Schoena here, there's just two days a week,
[00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:42.580] three days a week.
[00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:46.580] And in those days, you worked five days,
[00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:51.580] sometimes right into Saturdays, five, six days a week.
[00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:56.580] Fishermen were out five days a week.
[00:21:56.580 --> 00:22:00.580] Can you remember some real big runs?
[00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:04.580] Oh, yes, I can remember.
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:08.580] But I wouldn't say exactly what year they were.
[00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:10.580] But I can remember.
[00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:12.580] One of those days when I was working in the cannery,
[00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:15.580] I thought there was big runs every year.
[00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:19.580] Because there seemed to be no end to it, you know.
[00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:24.580] Half of the time you used to work till one and two o'clock in the morning.
[00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:27.580] And that was every day.
[00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:30.580] Sometimes you worked on Sundays.
[00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:33.580] There was that much fish.
[00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:39.580] And there was no conservation measurements there at that time, you know.
[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:42.580] And yet there was always a lot of fish.
[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:51.580] So, it seems to me now, the less the fishermen go out,
[00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:54.580] there isn't that much fish.
[00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:58.580] I don't know where it's going.
[00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:01.580] They're supposed to be preserving fish,
[00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:04.580] but it doesn't look as if they are.
[00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:07.580] But last year, they predicted a big run in the Schoena.
[00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:10.580] There was no such thing.
[00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:15.580] Would you go back to the Nass every winter?
[00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:19.580] Well, you mean my old hometown?
[00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:22.580] Well, they don't have that anymore.
[00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:27.580] After the flood, you know, they have a new village.
[00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:30.580] But no, I don't think I would want to go back.
[00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:33.580] I do go back, you know, to visit.
[00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:35.580] But I don't think I would want to go back.
[00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:37.580] I do go back, you know, to visit.
[00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:42.580] Every year, every fall, or every other year, I go back.
[00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:46.580] In fact, I was out there recently.
[00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:49.580] How about in the 20s and 30s?
[00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:53.580] Were you traveling back and forth then every year?
[00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:55.580] Well, I did every year,
[00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:58.580] because I worked down here in the summer, you see.
[00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:00.580] So I'd leave the Nass and I'd come down,
[00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:03.580] just like the rest of them are doing now.
[00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:04.580] Just like the rest of them are doing now.
[00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:07.580] See, all these houses are vacant now.
[00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:11.580] Next week, Herring starts.
[00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:14.580] Well, the first week in March,
[00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:18.580] everybody, mostly all these houses will be filled up.
[00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:21.580] See, they always go home after fishing is over.
[00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:23.580] They go to the villages,
[00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:25.580] and then they come back down again during Herring.
[00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:28.580] After Herring is over, then they go back home,
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:32.580] and then when fishing starts, they come back down again.
[00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:33.580] So, I don't know.
[00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:38.580] So it's usually hopping back and forth all the time.
[00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:41.580] When did you go back, usually?
[00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:43.580] Well, just to visit.
[00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:46.580] I was up there last month.
[00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:50.580] What time of year would you pack up and go home
[00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:54.580] when you were working down here at Inverness?
[00:24:54.580 --> 00:25:01.580] Oh, well, at that time I used to go home around October,
[00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:02.580] sometime like that.
[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:06.580] And spend the winter up there.
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:11.580] But I don't think I do it anymore.
[00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:13.580] Did the same people,
[00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:16.580] like did a lot of people from your village come down
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:19.580] and all work at the same cannery at Inverness?
[00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:22.580] No, they're scattered all over.
[00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:25.580] See, there's North Pacific Cannery here.
[00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:30.580] In those days, see, this used to be ABC,
[00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:32.580] belonged to ABC and Company.
[00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:38.580] And then Sunnyside Cannery, and then Cashier Cannery.
[00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:41.580] So you see all people go to different,
[00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:45.580] they work for different companies along the Skeena here.
[00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:48.580] But at that time I worked for Jay's Tots,
[00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:50.580] so that's where I go.
[00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:53.580] As soon as I get word from them,
[00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:56.580] they need me at a certain time,
[00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:58.580] I move, move back.
[00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:01.580] See, all the people along the Skeena here do the same thing.
[00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:06.580] Where did the other people that work there come from?
[00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:09.580] Oh, there's a lot of them that come from the Skeena
[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.580] at the Skeena here.
[00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:13.580] And a lot of them from the Nass,
[00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:15.580] different areas,
[00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:20.580] Kankolas and Port Simpson,
[00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:26.580] and then Ayanj, Canyon City,
[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:30.580] and Hazleton, and all those different areas,
[00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:31.580] Kitwanga.
[00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:32.580] And,
[00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:34.580] all the areas along the Skeena here,
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:38.580] you see they come down the Skeena in the summertime.
[00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:41.580] That's where they earned their living,
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:43.580] is along the Skeena.
[00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:49.580] Were there Chinese people from Vancouver too?
[00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:51.580] Oh yes, yes.
[00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:53.580] There used to be a lot of Chinese.
[00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:55.580] You don't see them anymore.
[00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:59.580] You see that's all gone, done with.
[00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:01.580] Automation's taken over,
[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:03.580] and so.
[00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:06.580] What parts of the cannery did they work in?
[00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:08.580] Well,
[00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:11.580] mostly they worked in the cannery.
[00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:14.580] They pitched fish,
[00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:15.580] and,
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:19.580] or they did all sorts of things, you know.
[00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:21.580] They were actually the,
[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:25.580] the main people that did everything in the cannery.
[00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:29.580] That's besides the mechanics and the engineers and whatnot.
[00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:31.580] And they were all white?
[00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:33.580] Yes, well mostly.
[00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:36.580] The mechanics and the engineers,
[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:38.580] they're all white.
[00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:40.580] The Japanese,
[00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:41.580] they,
[00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:42.580] like I said,
[00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:43.580] like the natives,
[00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:48.580] they were fishermen and cannery workers,
[00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:50.580] Japanese women.
[00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:53.580] Were there Chinese men and women,
[00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:55.580] or were just men?
[00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:56.580] Just the men.
[00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:58.580] They never did not,
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:00.580] not any canneries.
[00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:01.580] I don't think.
[00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:04.580] I don't know about the other canneries,
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:06.580] but mostly Japanese women,
[00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:08.580] they worked in the cannery.
[00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:11.580] But not the Chinese women.
[00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:16.580] I often used to wonder why they never did come to the canneries to work.
[00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:22.580] And I'm talking about the days when I was growing up.
[00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:24.580] Maybe it's different now.
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:26.580] So.
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:28.580] Did you,
[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:32.580] did you have much in common with them?
[00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:35.580] What, the Chinese?
[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:37.580] Well, of course.
[00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:39.580] Well, we worked with them, you know.
[00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:42.580] So,
[00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:44.580] that's what I was just saying earlier, you know,
[00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:48.580] because I was talking to the gentleman that just left here,
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:53.580] and we were talking about in those days, you know, that,
[00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:57.580] you know, you had to learn to get along with people.
[00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:00.580] But I don't know about other people now.
[00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:02.580] This is myself now.
[00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:06.580] But I know there was a lot of discrimination going on, you know,
[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:12.580] far more so in those days when I was growing up than today.
[00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:18.580] There's still discrimination now, but in a subtle way, you see.
[00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:24.580] People are quick to answer to things now.
[00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:26.580] And in those days, you know, the native people,
[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:31.580] they just took whatever was given to them, and that was it.
[00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:35.580] They were more or less
[00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:38.580] quiet about it, you know.
[00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:40.580] They'd accept.
[00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:43.580] Because if they did, you know, kind of fight back,
[00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:46.580] and they'd say, okay, there's the door.
[00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:51.580] So, it's more or less you just had to take.
[00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:53.580] That's the way it is.
[00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:55.580] But not anymore.
[00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:58.580] And the union, the Fisherman's Union come in,
[00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:00.580] I can remember the time, you know,
[00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:07.580] it was in my day and right up till now,
[00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:12.580] the union was a great help to the native people.
[00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:17.580] And that's why, you know, a lot of people,
[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:22.580] well, I wouldn't say a lot, but there are some that would say,
[00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:24.580] you know, well, the union is this,
[00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:26.580] and the union is that.
[00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:28.580] That isn't so.
[00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:30.580] If you have to work under certain conditions
[00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:34.580] where there's so many different races, you know,
[00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:38.580] and there's discrimination there,
[00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:42.580] and you've got to have somebody to look after things,
[00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:44.580] and that's what the union did.
[00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:47.580] You know, and they did come in.
[00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:50.580] They stomped out that discrimination.
[00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:53.580] And under their constitution,
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:31:01.580] there will be no discrimination by management or anybody,
[00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:03.580] any bosses in the plant.
[00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:08.580] If a person can do that job, they should be hired,
[00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:11.580] no matter who they are and where they come from,
[00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:13.580] what colour their skin is.
[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:18.580] So I say it's a lot better today than it was when,
[00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:20.580] you know, in the earlier days.
[00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:25.580] Thank you.
