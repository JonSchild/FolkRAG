[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720] dagas
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.320] and this flower isvest on me.
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.260] The wind seemedbbles were ham-rickling me.
[00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:50.920] Which world, then, would you paint for me,
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:30.920] But when you get home and see the garden
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:42.920] The many beautiful white roses that I once planted
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.920] I hope you won't forget them
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.920] Never, never again
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.920] There's no place for them there
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:11.920] Because the white roses are so pure
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.920] And the roses are so sweet
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.920] I hope you won't forget them
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.920] Never, never again
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.920] There's no place for them there
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:41.920] Because the white roses are so pure
