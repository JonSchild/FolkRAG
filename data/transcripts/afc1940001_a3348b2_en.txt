[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340] Three or four lines, oh, I know that.
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.440] King William was King James's son.
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.080] From a royal race he sprung.
[00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.040] Upon his breast he wore a star,
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.440] and in his mouth a big cigar.
[00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.860] Go choose you, East, go choose you, West,
[00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.600] go choose the one that you love best.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.560] If she's not here to take your part,
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.100] go choose another with all your heart.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.860] Down on this carpet you must kneel,
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.460] as sure as the grass grows in the field.
[00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.460] Salute your bride and kiss her sweet,
[00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.100] and now you may rise upon your feet.
[00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.480] And now you're married, you must be good,
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.000] to hire a man to chop your wood.
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.660] Hire another to carry it in,
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.240] and now you may kiss your true love again.
[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.800] That's all I know of that.
