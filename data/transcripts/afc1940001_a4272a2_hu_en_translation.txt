[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000] In my little garden, my dear father, I planted rosemary, my dear father.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.000] Every morning, my dear father, I washed my hands, my dear father.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:26.000] But the grass has fallen, and the weeds have also remained.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:35.000] But the bride is unhappy, who believes in the bride, my dear father.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:44.000] But the bride has been buried, and the weeds have also remained.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000] But the bride is unhappy, who believes in the bride, my dear father.
