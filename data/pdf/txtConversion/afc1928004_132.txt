Yon. attention I

And perhaps it'll cause you to smile. 
I'm jolly and gay, the truth I

And the girls both near and far, 
Says it's quite a

CHORUS. 
Driving, joulting, driving, on a

For when I

fare, I 
drive away dull care. 
As I 
sit ui my jaunting- car; 
The reins I 
grip, and I 
crack my whip, 
t And off goes my jaurting car. 
In Dublin town, of great renown, 
You'll find me on the stand ; 
On my car so nate, just take a 
sate, 
And I'll drive through the streets so grand, 
The sights so tine, all others outshine, 
No matter near or far, 
The reins CH grip, and crack my whip 
Auti oir files my jaunting car. 
Driving, joulting, &e. 
If a 
girl to your mind yon wish to flint 
OuId Ireland's just time part ; 
The colleens fair, I 
do declare, 
Are sure to steal your heart. 
-With a 
glance so sly and beaming eye, 
As bright as any star, 
By the powers of Jove, you're sure to fall in love 
If you drive in the jaunting car. 
Driving, joulting, 
So if you wish for sport, sure I'm the sort 
Can find you lots of fun ; 
I 
can sit on my yoke and crack a 
joke, 
With any boy under the sun. 
I 
know well enough where they sell good stuff, 
And the girls behind the bar, 
Can tell by my wink, what sort of drink 
Can grease tho wheels of my jaunting car. 
SPOKEN%—(2ar, your honor ; hero yon are, sir; the first car on the

You want a 
Hansom ; oh, well, as von are not over handsome,

THE DUBLIN DANCIN' 
MASTER. 
As sung by J. M. BURKE. 
AIR.—" Limerick Races." 
In Dublin city once there lived, 
A 
craythur gay an' hearty, oh I 
A dancin' master he by thrade, 
His name was Teddy M'Carthy, oh ! 
He taught the girls and boys to dance, 
And none could do so faster— 
He always danced so nate and nice; 
Did this Dublin Danciu' master. 
CHORUS. 
With his down the middle ! bands across! 
Go a 
little faster, oh, 
In an' out, and round about 
The Dublin dancin' masther, oh ! 
(Spoken.) Mr. M'Carthy, allow me to inthroduce to your notice, 
Mr. Cornelius Fitzpelthers Fitzfoozle O'Shaughnessy, a 
new 
pupil. 
Och, how do you do, sir, you,re a 
pupil I've had in my 
eye for many a 
day, and I 
assure you sir, you could not put 
yourself in betther hands for the practice of your feet. 
This is 
somethin' in your style o' dancin' I 
presume sir ? ( Dances a 
Spanish waltz.) Now, Sir, just thry that. (Imitates an awkward 
pupil.) 
Ah, sir, l'in afeard you'll nivir make a 
dancer ; your 
legs are not fellows ; however, I'll see if I 
can't cure you in time. 
Now Teddy taught both reels and jigs, 
And all the other dances, 
From Highland fling to plain qnadrille, 
To please the ladies' fancies. 
Patsev Whelan, Mickey Flynn, 
And a 
boy called Kit McAsthor, 
Kem to learn a 
Highland fling 
From the Dublin dancin' masther. 
Down the middle, hands across! 
Go a 
little faster, oh ! 
In and out, and round about, 
The Dublin dancin' masther, 
.(Spoken) 
Wilkim gintlemin, to my academy. .Allow me to 
inthroduce yef.to your partners. 
Ahem ! Misther Flynn—Miss 
Biddy Sawdust; Mister Kit McAsthor—Miss Julia Toothpic ; 
Mr. Patsey Whelan—Miss Honoria Wheelbarrow. 
Now, leedies 
and gintlemin, plase to teek .yer .places . for a Scotch rael. 
‘Dances Highland fling.) 
Thus Teddy got the boys and girls 
Proficient iu their dances— 
Polkas, jigs and schottisches, 
illazourkas, reels and lancers. 
No matter what the dance he taught, 
None could go it faster, 
And none could dance an Irish jig, 
Like the Dublin dancin' masther„ 
Down the middle etc. 
(Spoken.) Now leedies and gintlemin, tack your places for the 
:next dance ; you see how fine you're gettin' on. 
Our family 
,Nere always celebrated for their dancin propinA ties ; iii 
young-
est son, although not as old as his eldest brother. could dance a 
jig before he was able to walk : mid now for the next dance.

Oh boys I'm not long from the army,

WHAT IRISH BOYS CAN DO. 
Answer to " No Irish Need Apply," a,s sung by.J. M. BURIEN. 
(They insult an Irishman, and think nought of what they say, 
They'll call him green, an Irish bull ; it happens every day; 
Now to these folks I'll say a word ; to slug a 
song ill try, 
And answer to th,se dirty words : " No Irish need apply !" 
go, if you'll give attention I'D sing my song to you, 
And the subject of this song shall be : What Irish boys can do. 
if you'd come to Ireland they'd treat you well I'm sure, 
Pat would slim..., his last potato with the destitute and poor ; 
If you were sick aud weary, and had no place to rest, 
The bed you'd get, though poor perhaps, would be Pat's very best; 
He'd nurse you, too; he would that, and give you whisky, too; 
'Ind you cannot find a 
nobler act than Irishmen can do. 
oid you ever know an Irishman from any danger flinch ? 
In lighting, too, he d 
rather die than give his toe an inch; 
Among the bravest in the world are the sons of Erin's green Isle. 
Sure, the Iron Duke of Wellington was a 
native of the 
And didn't he badly whip the French on the plains of Waterloo? 
Which plainly showed to the whole world what Irishmen can do. 
Old Ireland's had her warriors, who fought both true and brave, 
Pat's assisted every nation, on the land and on the wave. 
AM( poets, too, she's had ; yes, many and many a 
score; 
Wher.m can von find much brighter stars than Lover or Torn Moore I 
Old Ireland's had bet' actors, and authors not a 
few ; 
And things of wit and humor the Irish all can do. 
Bid you ne'er hear tell of Sheridan, or lamented Catharine Hayes! 
Did you ne'er see fun in Irish songs, or laugh at Irish plays ? 
Old Ireland's had her statesm-n; their fame the wide world ring 1 
She's likewise had musicians to tune her old harp strings I 
Not all lush girls are ber...tiful, but then they'r, always true, 
And for faith and generc(ity the Irish girls will do. 
And then, too, in the present war between the North and South, 
Let no dirty slur on Irish ever escape your mouth ; 
Sure, did yoa ne'er hear tell of the 69th, who bravely fought at Bull 
Itun 
And Meagher. of the seven days' fl!dit that was in front of Richmond, 
With General Shiulds, who fought so brave for the Flag Red, White 
and Blue I 
And anything like the bayonet-chaage, the Irish boys can do, 
Then, why slar upon the Irish ? 
Why are they treated so ? 
What is it you have against them ? is What I 
want to know. 
Sure. they Nvollk for all they get, and that you can't deny ! 
Then, why insult ti em with the words: No Irish need apply 7 
It 
on want to find their principles. go search the wide worlA through, 
And you'll find all things that's noble the Irish folks can do.

IRELAND, GRADIACHREE. 
Allt—" Gramachree Macrnskeen Lawn." 
Written and sung with great success by J. M. Buittic,, Irish Comedian 
There's an Isle beyant the Sea, 
Where Irishmen should be, 
To guard both night and day tenderly. 
But absent from their home 
To other lands they roam, 
From Ireland Gramachree, Gramachree. 
Ah, poor unhappy land, 
Thy best sons bear the brand, 
Of Prison Exile— and alas—for thee 
Still round our hearts entwined, 
_,.1.nd in its enre enshrined, 
is Ireland Gramachreo, Gramaehree. 
Oar Island is the fairest, 
Our Island is the dear. st, 
Unhappy are thy children o'er the Sea, 
But a 
day will come — I 
pray, 
When all who are away— 
Shall see Ireland Granmehree. Granmehree.

THE BASHFUL LOVER. 
&tug with great applause, with the Mirror of Ireland by Miss ANNIN 
F. Itustt. 
I 
know a 
very charming youth, 
As far as looks will go, 
And if I 
told you all the truth, 
His name I'm sure you know. 
He pays a 
visit twice a 
week, 
His manners are absurd; 
.fie looks as if he'd like to speak, 
But never says a 
word. 
CHORUS. 
I 
never raw, in all my fife 
A lover so absurd ; 
Although I 
know he wants a 
wife, 
lie never says a 
word. 
Now, when he calls, he takes a 
chair, 
And slyly looks around; 
He runs his fingers through his hair; 
Then gazes on the ground. 
And very oft' he gives a 
sigh, 
The saddest ever heard, 
He makes me mad enough to cry— 
He never says a 
word. 
I 
never saw, (tc. 
His eyes are briAit and eloquent, 
wish his tont2;ue wa,z, in() , 
And when upon me they are bent, 
Th.ey pierce me through and through. 
I 
try to put him at his ease, 
Fin 
cheerful as a 
bird , 
He makes me mml enough to cry, 
He never says a 
word. 
I 
never saw, itc. 
What a 
husband he would make, 
How still would be the house, 
His gentle voice Avotild never break 
The slumbers of a 
mouse. 
I 
never Sa NV in all my life 
A 
lover so absurd, 
Although I 
know he wants a 
wife, 
lie never says a 
word. 
I 
never saw, am.

THE CAT'S MEAT GIEL.--1CoscLuDED.] 
Instead of meat, some down the areas throw sticks, 
All the profit they reap, while Grimalkin gets " nix," 
But Tabbies and Tortoise-shells rushed in the street 
At the sound of her voice when she cried out " Cats' Meat! 
Cats' Meat I 
Cats' Meat I" 
A

bundle, Cats' Meat I" 
Her honesty charmed me, I 
walked up straightway; 
Said I, " Miss, will you marry me? answer, I 
pray; 
A 
fond 'yes' pronounce from those ruby-lips sweet," 
But the answer she gave in return was—" Cats' Meat!

Cats' Meat!

At length to the altar I 
led her away, 
" 
Wilt thou wed with this man ?" the fat parson did say. 
He waited her answer, when, horror complete I 
'Stead of saying" I 
will," all she said was—" Cats' Meat ! 
Cats' Meat I 
Cats' Meat ! 
A

We married, but a 
cat and dog life we led, 
For her barrow and cats' meat so run in her head. 
If I 
asked " for supper what have you to eat 3" 
Nine times out of ten her reply was " Cats' Meat 
Cats' Meat! (Spoken—flow delicious) Cats' Meat 1 
A

jerked beef.) 
They woke me up early one fine Sunday morn, 
Awl I 
rushed up the stairs to behold my " first-born;" 
The dear little cherub was smiling so sweet, 
Said I, " Which sex is it ?" she answered—" Cats' Meat 1 
Cats' Meat 1 
Cats' Meat ! 
A

But she turned her toes up one dull winter's day, 
To a 
cheap undertaker's I 
hastened away ; 
Said I," Take great care that you box her up neat, 
Or she'll wake all the others by bawling ' Cats' Meat

OLD IRELAND MUST BE FREE, BOYS. 
As sung by J. M. Bunkr.. 
AIR—" Always Gay and Free, Boys." 
While time is stealing o'er us, friends, we ought to bear in mind, 
Our dear and lovely Erin, land we left behind ; 
We'll till the goblets to the brim, and this our toast shall be, 
Death to every traitor, and old Ireland must be free. 
CHORUS. 
• 
Old Ireland must be free, boys, 
Old Ireland shall be free, boys, 
The home you soon will see, boys, 
When Ireland will be free. 
What has poor Paddy done, that he in fetters should be bound, 
You'll find not braver men, search the Universe all around ; 
The glorious deeds that they have done, on land and on the sea, 
Will always live in history, and old Ireland must be free. 
Old Ireland, 
Then keep yourselves united, with each other be at peace, 
Be never backward in your work, in good (, fforts never cease; 
Do or die for Ireland's sake, your watchword that skuld be, 
And proclaim aloud to all the world t!lat old 'Ireland roust be free. 
Old Irelanl. & c. 
have we not waited patiently in hopes our rights to gain, 
lint we will not bear it longer, our freedom \Nell maintain ; 
Then draw the sword and strike the blow, and let the tyrants 
Tbut each Irish heart beats true and warm, and old ire' 
must be free. 
Old Ireland must be free, boys, 
Old Ireland must he tree, boys, 
Then you soon shall sec, boys, 
When Ireland must be free, boys.

PATSEY JA.RVEY. 
Song and Dance. 
Written and sung by J.11. BURKS. 
Al11-" On the Road to Brighton." 
The song I 
am about to sing it's of an Irish Jarvey, 
Who bought a 
horse for eighteen shillings, which made him all 
complate ; 
He was a 
regular stunner at driving horse or pony, 
lie would drive you to the world's end if the road it wasn't 
stony. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, boys, if you were to see him trotting, 
Patsey was the driver's name, 
And he will not be forgotten.— [Repeat chorus.] 
At the strawberry beds, sure Pat was always there, 
With his gray breeches and frieze coat, he was like the great 
Lord Mayor; 
With the reins in one hand, and the whip in the other, 
And as he drove along, the boys behind would roar out, 
Patsey—well—come down and carry your brother. 
Oh, boys, dfc. 
In Sackville street one rainy day while going with a 
tack, 
The horse began his tantrums, some body gave him, 0, holy 
smack, 
Oh, murther now, says Paddy, what are you doing, 
want to send myself and this gentleman to ruin. 
Oh, boys, & C. 
Oh, moral, boys, now when horses you go buy, 
Be sure, they're safe, and sound, nd snot blind of an eye, 
For you see how I 
have been taken in, 
You. s;ec I 
only had the mean bones and skin. 
Oh, boys, ttc.

LINES. 
Dedicated to Ras M. BURKE, Comedian, and recited by him. 
By EDW. STEWART LLOYD 
I 
long to gaze on the towering hills. 
On the castles ruined, yet grand. 
To roam once more o'er the meadows and fields, 
Of my fathers' native land ; 
To gaze once more at that storied Isle, 
Where the great have lived and died, 
Where Genius, Valor, Art and Truth, 
Have reigned in stateliest pride. 
I 
long to grasp the tA-wora hands, 
Of patriots true as steel, 
And I 
long to meet those tyrant bands, 
Who would make the brave Celt kneel. 
I 
long to bow o'er the sacred sod, 
above Erin's martyred pride, 
To bless the heroes sleeping there, 
And the cause for which they died. 
And I 
love the red-checked maids who dwell 
Beneath the sunny skies— 
But better than all, I 
long to see 
Ten thousand heroes rise, 
And ' neath that fading Flag of Green, 
To which we proudly bend the knee, 
To strike one blow at the Saxon foe, 
Which would make poor Erin free. 
And g 
ateful hearts are beating now, 
With hope to see that day— 
Beating in this western land, 
Three thousand miles away.

Don't tell me you think it's the eat ; 
Cats don't tap, tap. tap like that! 
Cats don't know when it's half-past eight, 
And conic tap, tapping at the garden gate. 
Cats don't know when it's half-past eight, 
And come tap, tapping at the garden gate! 
John Bull, he was an Englishman, and he went on tramp one 
day, 
With three pence in his pocket, to carry him on his way ; 
Ha travellet for miles and miles and no one did he see, 
Till he fell in with an Irishman by the mune of Paddy Magee. 
" 
Good morning," says John Bull, " Good morning, sir," says 
Pat, 
"Where are you going?" says Johnny; " I'm on the road, that's 
flat.'" 
"have you any money about you ?.' says Johnny unto Pat, 
" 
It's the only thing I 
wanted, for I 
have not got a 
rap." 
They trudged along together, met a 
Scotchman on their way, 
" 
Oh, lend us a 
bob, now, Scotty, to help us on our way ;" 
" 
Lend you a 
bob," said Scotty, " faith and sure," said he, 
" 
It's the only thing I 
wanted, for I'm not worth a 
bawbee." 
" 
I 
have three pence," said the Englishman ; " what shall I 
do 
with that?" 
" 
Oh, buy three pen'orth of whiskey, it will cheer us up," said 
Pat. 
"Don't do that." said the Scotchman, " 
tell you what to do, 
Buy three pen'orth of oatmeal, and we'll all of us have burgoo." 
Now with my three-pence," said the Englishman, " hal:At:tar 
tern loaf, what say ? 
And in yonder haystack we'll sleep all hunger away; 
We can quench our thirst by the running brook, beside the broil-
ing 
And the loaf shall be his in the morning who dreams the largest 
dream.' 
John Bill he dreamed by the morning that ten thousand men 
had been 
For ten years digging a 
turnip up, the largest ever was seen, 
At last they got this turnip up by working night and day, 
And it took five thousand horses to draw this turnip away. 
Now, the Scotchman he dreamt by the morning ten thousand 
men had been 
For ten years in aking a 
boil-;r, the largest ever was seen ; 
" 
What was it made of Y" said the Englishman, " was it made 
of copper or tin?" 
Said Scotty, " 'T 
was made of copper, to boil your turnip in." 
"Blood and 'ounds," said the Irishman, " I've been draming a 
very big drame, 
I 
dreamt I 
was in a 
haystack, beside of a 
broiling strame ; 
I 
dreamt you, I, and Scotty was there, ' tis true or I'm an 'oaf. 
I 
dreamt that I 
was hungry—so I 
got up and ate the loaf."

WATERFORD BOYS_ 
Aia :-" The Flaming O'Flannigans." 
Well, boys, for divarsion, we all met together; 
I'll tell you how from Waterford hither I 
came , 
I 
left that dear city in dark, gloomy weather, 
My heart it was light, and my pockets the same. 
I 
lilted a 
song as I 
tripped it along; 
By the road-side a 
tavern I 
happened to spy, 
And, as I 
was meltin', my pockets I 
felt in 
For the price of a 
drink; I 
was mortally dry. 
CHORUS. 
But we are the boys for fun, wit, and element, 
Drinking, and dancing, and all other joys, 
Ructions, destruction, divarsion, and devilment; 
Who can compare with the Waterford Boys.? 
In the tavern I 
strolled, out the landlord he rolled; 
Good tnornin', says he. 
Says I: If you please, 
Could you shake me a 
bed, but first bring some bread, 
With a 
bottle of porter and small lump of cheese ? 
For, times they are queer, arid provisions are dear; 
If you cannot get meat, with cheese be content. 
tlys the landlord: You're right, as he brought me the bite; 
So, I 
rolled up my sleeves and at it I 
went. 
We are the boys, (te. 
fly bread and cheese ended, I 
then condescended 
To seek Illy repose: so, I 
bade ' em good-night. 
{loon under the clothes I 
was trying to doze, 
But first popped in my toes, and then popped out the light 
S'ot long was I 
sleeping, I 
heard something creeping, 
And meandering, and scratching about the bed-post. 
WATERFORD BOYS.—[CONCLUDED.] 
My breath I 
suspended, but the noise never ended: 
Thinks I; ye have mighty long claws for a 
ghost ! 
We are the boys, &e. 
The row it commences: near out of my senses, 
I 
ventured to peep from beneath the bed-clothes. 
Milla murther I 
what's that ? 'Twas a 
big black jack rat, 
With a 
leap from the flcor, came a 
top of my nose. 
• 
Divil swape ye ! says I, for a 
scheming mild vagabono ; 
Take that, and that. 
I 
jumped on the floor; 
Oh I 
Moses; blue fire, Biddy! Sophia ! 
The rats they are eating me up by the score ! 
We are the boys, dr.e. 
The landlord affrightened, he then brought a 
light in. 
Says I: I'm near dead, it's time I'm away; 
Says he: Before going, I'd have ye be knowing, 
For supper and bed you've five shillings to pay. 
Five shillings! for what ? Now, don't be disgracing 
Yourself as a 
rogue, says I, if you please; 
When I 
can't sleep for rats, you've the divil's own face on ye, 
To charge me five shillings for plain bread and cheese I 
We are the boys, (ke. 
Says he: Och ! those rats, I 
wish they would leave me, 
They ruin my trade. 
I'm not worth a 
rap. 
Says I: The five shillings now would you forgive me, 
If I 
tell you the way to keep out every rat ? 
I 
will.—Says I: Then to supper invite them, 
And plain bread and cheese set before them, be sure, 
Don't mind if they're willing, but charge them five shillings, 
Bad luck to the rat that ye'll ever see more ! 
We are the boys, oke.

THE TWIG OF THE SHANNON. 
On the beautiful banks of the Shannon, 
There grows such an illag,ant tree, 
And the first that it bears is shilalab, 
I've a 
sprig of it here you niay- see. 
'Tis the remnant of all my large fortune, 
It's the friend that ne'er pla .‘ 
cii me a 
triok, 
And I'd rather lose halt' lity supportin' 
Than part with this illagant stick. 
CHORLS. 
'Twas a 
delicate sprig in the summer, 
When I 
first cut it from the tree, 
And I've kept it through all the cold weather, 
Faix the sprig of shilitfith for me. 
It's the porter that carried my luggage, 
For I've shouldered it many a 
mile, 
And from thieves it will safely protect me, 
In a 
beautiful delicate style. 
It is useful for rows in the summer. 
And when Whiter ( -IOM'S eli w i h a 
storm, 
If You're short of a 
time in the caliin, 
1:ou can burn it to keep yourself warm. 
'Twas a 
delicate sprig, &c. 
It's a 
friend both so true and so constant, 
It's constancy pen cannot paint, 
For it always is there when it's wanted, 
And sometimes its there when it :lint. 
It beats all your guns and your rifles, 
For it goes off whene'er you desire, 
And it's sure to hit what' or it's aimed at, 
For shilalahs they never miss tire, 
'Twas a 
delicate sprig, &O. 
It's a 
talisman so upright and honest, 
Twenty shillings it pays to the pound 
So if ever it gets you in debt, sir, 
You are sure to be paid I'll be bound. 
It never runs up a 
long score. sir, 
In trade its not given to WI, 
There's no danger of it 's being insolvent, 
For it always pays down on the nail. 
'Twas a 
delicate sprig, &O. 
And faith at an Irish election, 
An argument striking it's there : 
For with brickbats and sprigs of the Shannon 
We see things 0
-o 
all 
and square, 
It's then there's no bribery at all. sit', 
They vote as they like, every soul, 
But it's no use opposing shilalah 
Or it's sure to eome down on the poll.

SHAMUS 0 
BRIEN. 
Oh ! sweet is the smile of the beautiful morn, 
As it peeps through the curtain of night, 
And the voice of the nightingale singing his tune, 
While the stars seem to smile with delight. 
Old nattr- .ow lingers in silent repose, 
And toe sweet breath of summer is calm, 
While I 
sit and wonder if Shamus e'er knows 
How sad and unhappy I 
am 
Oh I 
Shamus O'Brien, why don't you come home, 
You don't how know happy I'll be; 
I've but one darling wish, and that is that you'd come 
And for ever be happy with me! 
I'll smile when you smile, and I'll weep when you weep, 
I'll give you a 
kiss for a 
kiss, 
• 
And all the fond vows that I've made you, I'll keep—. 
What more can I 
promise than this ? 
Does the sea have such bright and such beautiful charms 
That your heart will not leave it for me? 
Oh! why did I 
let you go out of my arms, 
Like a 
bird that was caged and is free I 
Oh I 
Shamus O'Brien, dm. 
! 
Shamus O'Brien, Pm loving you yet, 
And my heart is still trusting and kith! ; 
It was you who first took it, and can you forget, 
That love for another you'd find ? 
No ! no ! if you break it with sorrow and pain, 
I'll then have a 
duty to do ; 
If you'll bring it to me, I'll mend it again, 
And trust it, dear Shamus, to you. 
Oh I 
Shamus O'Brien, &c. 
I'm Denny Blake from County Clare, 
And hero, at your command, 
To slug a 
song in praise of home, 
Anti my own native land! 
I've sailed to foreign counteries, 
And in many clinics I've been, 
But my heart is still with Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
CHORUS. 
I 
love my native country, 
And the' richer land's I've seen, 
Yet I 
can't forget OuId Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
Poor Pat is often painted 
With a 
ragged coat and hat; 
His heart and hospitality, 
has much to do with that. 
Let slanderers say what they will, • 
They cannot call him mean; 
Sure, a 
stranger's always welcome 
Where the grass grows green. 
I 
love my, dr,Ct. 
He's foolish, but not vicious, 
his faults I 
won't defend ; 
His purse to help the orphan, 
his life to serve a 
friend, 
He'll give, without a 
in ormur— 
So, his follies try and screen ; 
For, there's noble hearts in Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
I 
love my, &S. 
'Tis true he has a 
weakness 
For a 
drop of something pure, 
But that's a 
slight debility 
That many more endure. 
He's fond of fun, he's witty, 
Though his wit ' tis not too keen; 
For, there's feeling hearts in Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
I 
love my, &a. 
There's not a 
true-horn Irishman, 
Wherever he may be, 
But loves the little Emerald 
That sparkles on the sea. 
May the sun of bright prosperity 
Shine peaceful and serene, 
And bring better days to Erin, 
Where the grass groww green! 
For 1 
love my, 864.7. 
When Pat came o'er the hills his colleen fair to see, 
His whistle, loud and shrill. his signal was to be. 
Oh! Marv, the mother cried, there's sonic one whistling- sure. 
Oh 1 
Mother, you know, it's the wind that's whistling through 
the door. 
(Whistles: Garry Owen.) 
I've lived a 
long time, Mary, in this wide world, my dear, 
But the wind to whistle like that, I 
never yet did hear. 
But, mother, you know, the fiddle hangs close behind the chink, 
And the wind upon the strings is playing a 
tune, I 
think. 
(Dog barks.) 
The dog is barking now, and the fiddle can't play that tune. 
But, Mother, you know that dogs will bask, when they see the 
moon. 
Now, how can he see the moon, when you know he's old and 
blind ? 
Blind dogs can't see the moon, nor fiddles be played by the 
wind. 
(Pig grunts.) 
And now there is the pig uneasy in his mind. 
But, Mother, you know, they say that pigs can see the wind. 
That's all very well in the day, but then I 
may remark 
That pigs, no more than we, can see anything in the dark. 
Now, Pm not such a 
fool as you think, I 
know very well it is 
Pat, 
Get out ! you whistling thief, and get along home out o' that. 
And you, be off to your bed, and don't bother me with your 
tears; 
For, tho' I've lost my eyes, I 
have not lost my ears. 
M ORAL. 
Now, Boys, too near the house don't courting go, d'ye mind ? 
Unless you're certain sure the old woman's both deaf and blind; 
The days when they were young, forget they never can; 
They're sure to tell the difference 'twit wind, fiddle, pig, dog, 
or man.

THE ROCKY ROAD TO DUBLIN. 
Ant ; " Irish Jig.” 
In the merry month if June, when first from home I 
started, 
And left the girls alone, sad and broken hearted, 
Shook hands with Father dear, kissed my darling Mother, 
Drank a 
pint of beer my terrs and grief to smother: 
Then off to reap the corn and leave where I 
was born, 
I 
cut a 
stout black- thorn, to banish ghost or goblin : 
With a 
pair of bran new brozues I 
rattled o 
er the begs: 
Sure I 
frightened all tha dogs on the rocky road to Dublin.

For, it is the rocky road here's the road to Dublin ; 
Here's the rocky road, now fire away to Dublin! 
The steam- coach was at hand, the driver said lied cheap ones 
But sure. the luggage van was too much for my ha'pence. 
For Engiand I 
was bound it would never do to balk it: 
For every step of to ro - d, be dad says I, I'll walk it

In Dublin next arrived—I 
thought it was a

WAKE NOT THAT HARP AGAM 
Wake not that harp again, 
N hands but mine may sweep, 
Impulsive o'er the strings, 
Let its hushed echoes sleep. 
For plaintive- notes of war, 
Might mingle in its strain; 
That harp is si.ent now, 
Why shoud it wake again. 
Once music soft and sweet, 
Rang from this gentle lyre ; 
Love taught it dulcet notes, 
Faith gave it sacred fire, 
Though lov:: may linger still, 
And hope yet wear a 
smile, 
Faith shrinking, trumbling, stands, 
Doub ing ' t 
ween truth and guile. 
Not heav'n can tempt its flight, 
No hope its bloom restore, 
Wake not that harp again, 
It ne'er must vibrate more. 
For plAntive notes of war, 
Might ining,le in its strain, 
That harp is silent now, 
Why should it wake again. 
I'LL WAIT AT THE GATE FOR THEE 
Farewell, farewell, my darling wife, 
Farewell my mother dear 
Father, mine was a happy life, 
Made so by kindred dear ; 
But now the angels call me home, 
From toil and care to Le free, 
Trust on lov'd wife, tho' now alone, 
I'll wait at the gate for thee ! 
Trust on lov'd wife, tho' now. alone, 
I'll wait at the gate for thee! 
Tell sisters all how deep I 
lov'd, 
My younger brothers too; 
But, darling 
ml re dear than all, 
I'm thinking now of you ; 
Hush ! dent you hear sweet voices call? 
To henv'n I 
go from thee, 
Trust on lov'd wife, they still do call, 
I'll wait at the gate for thee ? 
Trust on lov'd wife, they still do call, 
I'll wait at the gate for thee? 
The sweet west wind is flying, 
Over the purple sea; 
And the amber daylight dying 
On roadway, hill and tree; 
The cattle- belle are ringing 
Among the slanting downs, 
And children's voices flinging 
Glad echoes through the towns. 
Oh, summer (lay so soon away, 
The happy hearted sigh and say— 
Sweet is the light, and sad thy flight, 
And sad the words ' Good night !" " Good ni ht r 
And saki the words " Good night I"" Goou ni 
t !" 
The wan white clouds are trailing 
Low o'er tho level plain; 
And the wind brings with its wailings, 
The chill of coming rains. 
Fringed by the faded heather, 
Wide pools of water lie; 
And birds and leaves together 
Whirl through the ev'ning sky. 
Haste thee away, 0 winter (lay!" 
The weary hearted sigh and say— 
Sad is thy light, and slow thy flight. 
Sweet were the words - Good night !" " Good night !• 
Sweet wore the words " Good night !" " Good night 
Hear ye not mild Erin's Harp, 
'Tis sounding in the air: 
It bids y- e

Your faith ful vows declare. 
It bids ye bear her colors, 
Her noble sons and true— 
A prouder title would ye have—

Shall hear across the water, 
."They helped us as they should." 
And ey'ry man and 
Who helps— shall hear it said— 
" 
They have as well as others placed 
The Green above the Red!" 
Let us think of those at home, 
And of our country dear; 
And by de ermined will and force, 
Make British tyrants fear. 
Come let usjul ri the strife, boys., 
Alnd we shall live to see— 
The boast of Ireland's girls -and boys— 
" 
Our country is now fret. !"

THE IRISHMAN,-
There was a 
lady, lived at Leith, 
A lady, very stylish, man, 
And yet in spite of all her teeth, 
She tell in love with an Irishman. 
A pretty ugly Irishman, 
A wild tremendous Irishman, 
A tearing, swearing, thumping, bumping,. 
Roaring. ramping Irishman 
His face was no ways beautiful, 
For with small-pox ' twas scarred across; 
And the shoulders of the ugly dog, 
Were almost double a 
yard across. 
Oh ! the lump of an Irishman, 
The whiskey-devouring Irishman; 
The great he-ro ,ue, with his wonderful brogue,. 
The fighting, rioting, Irishman, 
One of his eyes was bottle green, 
The other was out, my detr ; 
And the calves of his wicked looking legs, 
Were more than two feet across, may dear. 
Oh! the great big Irishman. 
The rattling, tattling Irishman, 
The stamping, ramping, swaggering, staggering, 
Lathering swash of an Irishman ! 
His name was a 
terrible name, indeed, 
Being Michael Thady 
And whenever he emptied his tumbler of punch, 
He'd not rest till he filled it full again. 
The boosing, bruising Irishman. 
The jolly, ' toxicated Irishman 
The whiskey, frisky, rummy, grummy, 
Handy, no dandy, Irishman 
This was the lad the ladies loved, 
Like all the girls of quality, 
And he broke the skulls of the men of Leith, 
Just by the way of jollity. 
Oh ! the lathering Irishman, 
The barbarous, savage Irishman ; 
The hearts of the maid's and the gentlemen's heads 
Were battered like the divil by this Irishman ! 
A
THE IRISH STRANGER. 
Oh, pity the fate of a 
Tiler Irish str anger, 
That's wandered thus far from his home ; 
I 
sigh for protection from want. woe and danger, 
But know not which way to roam. 
I 
ne'er shall return to Hibernia's bowers, 
For bie-otry bath trampled her sweetest of flowers, 
That gave comfort to me in my loneliest hours, 
They are gone and I'll oe .er see them more. 
With wonder I 
gazed on yon lofty building, 
As in o-randenr it rose for its lord ; 
With sorrow I 
beheld my own garden soon yielding, 
Its choicest of fruits for its board : 
Ent where is my father's low eotta ,(e of clay. 
'Wherein I (lid spend many a 
lon.g. happy (lay, 
Alas! has his lordship removed it away ? 
Yes, it has gone, and I'll ne'er see it more. 
'When nature was seen on the sloe-bush and bramble, 
Sit smithy ,. 
in beautiful bloom— 
O'er field without danger I 
used to ramble, 
And lavish amidst her perfume : 
Or range thro' the woods where the gay feather'd throng. 
Hid joyfully sing their loud-echoing ; 
The days, then, of summer passed sweetly along, 
Now they are gone, and I'll ne'er see them more. 
When the sloes and the berries hung ripe on the bushes, 
I've gathered them off withomt harm 
And gone to the fields where I've shorn the green rushes, 
Preparin,-, for winter's cold storm. 
Or I've sat by the tire on c, cold winter's night, 
Along with my friends tellin"- tales of delight, 
Those tales gave me pleasure, I 
could them invite, 
Now they are gone, shall I 
ne'er see them more I 
That Erin, sad Erin, it grieves me to ponder, 
On the wrongs of thy injured Isle; 
Thy sons, many thousands deploring to wander, 
On shores off far away in exile. 
But give me the power to cross o'er the main, 
America inight yield me some shelter from pain, 
I'm only lamenting whilst here I 
remain, 
For the joys that I'll never see more. 
Farewell then, Et-in. aila those I 
left weeping 
I
-pon her disconsolate shore 
Farewell to the grave where my father lies sieeping, 
That around I 
still dearly adore. 
Farewell to each pleasure I 
once had at home, 
Farewell, now a 
stranger in England I 
roam, 
0 
g_ive my past joys. or give me a 
tomb; 
Yes, in pity I 
ask for no more. 
,idEET ME, 
MISS MOLLY MALONE. 
Ant :—" Meet Me by Moonlight Alone." 
Meet me, Miss Molly Malone, 
At the grove at the end of the vale, 
Be sure that you don't come alone. 
Bring a 
pot of your master's strong ale; 
With a 
nice bit of beef and some bread, 
Some pickles or cucumbers green, 
Dr a 
nice little dainty pig's head, 
'Tis the loveliest fit- bit e'er seen, 
Then meet me Miss Molly Malone. 
Then meet me Miss Molly Malone. 
Pastry may do for the gay, 
Old maids may find comfort in tea, 
But there's something about ham and beef 
That agrees a 
deal better with me; 
Remember my cupboard is bare, 
Then come if my dear life you prize; 
I'd have liv'd the last fortnight on air, 
But you sent me two nice mutton pies. 
Then meet me, Miss Molly Malone, 
Then meet me, Miss Molly Malone. 
{ THE SOLDIER OF ERIN. 
AIR: —" 
Exile of Erin." 
The sLadows of darkness around him were falling, 
And eve's lonely star lit the wanderer's way, 
When the . arp of the minstrel, his footsteps recalling, 
The brave soldier paused at the heart- moving lay. 
Oh ! dear to my soul in the spring- time of feeling, 
Ere the blight of the cold world had swept o'er its flowere; 
Was that strain of in 
childhood from tender lips stealing. 
In fair Connamara's now cleolate bow'rs. 
Sweet song of my boyhood, still deeper and deeper, 
It sinks on my heart as I 
list to the strain ; 
Like a 
dream of the dead that steals o'er the sleeper, 
And brings back the lost and the Ived ones again. 
Dear voice of the past, like the lone harp of Tara 
It wakes 'mid the ruins of all I 
deplore ; 
Farewell to thy green hills, my fair Connamara, 
First home of my heart, 1 
shall see thee no more.

PAT S PILGRIM OF LOVE. 
RECITATIVE. 
Och, Biddy my swate darlin, I 
bawl in vain, 
Biddy, dear Biddy, I'm wet through with rain, 
The dirty children mock me all around, 
And wid dear Biddy does each pig stye resound. 
Tim Cronin who lived by the Cow and Worsted Stocking, 
I 
met near the bog, at the end of the town, 
Ho swore by the powers I 
desarved a 
dacent knocking, 
He was after knocking me up, but I 
knock'd the varmint down. 
°cif, now Paddy says be, " what is it you'd be at 
Faith says 1, " you would get around me, but ye see I've laid you 
flat," 
And amember when to Biddy's ye betake yersil agin, 
There's sure to be a 
bating for the foe of Paddy Flinn. 
So I 
wished him better luck, and I 
left the spalpeen sprawling, 
And hasten'd to you Biddy, with a 
heart, love, so true. 
Thin listen to your Paddy while his tinder tale he's bawling, 
In this hard shower to let him stand, sure it is vert, hard in you, 
But see the door is open, so Ill boldly venture in. 
Here's bad luck and betther manners to the foes of Paddy Flinn. 
But see, tte. 
MY EMMET'S NO MORE. 
Despair in her wild eye, a 
daughter of Erin 
Appear'd on the cliffs of the bleak rocky shore; 
Loose in the wind flo.v'd her dark streaming ringlets 
And heedless she gaz'd on the dread surge's roar. 
Loud rang her harp in wild tones of despairing ; 
The time pass'd away with the present comparing, 
And in soul-thrilling strains deeper sorrow declaring, 
She sang Erin's woes and her Emmet no more. 
0, Erin, my country, your glory's departed ; 
For tyrants and traitors have stabbed thy heart's! core, 
Thy daughters have laved in the streams of affliction, 
Thy patriots have tied, or lie stretched in their gore, 
Ruthless ruffians now prowl thro' thy hamlets forsaken, 
From pale hungry orphans their last morsel have taken; 
The screams of thy females no pity awaken ; 
Alas I 
my poor country, your Emmet's no more. 
Brave was his spirit, yet mild as the Brahmin, 
His heart bled in anguish the wrongs of the poor ; 
To relieve their hard sufferings he brav -d 
every danger, 
The vengeance of tyrants undauntedly bore. 
E'en before hint the proud titled villains in power 
Were seen, though in ermine, in terror to cower ; 
But alas ! he is gone—he has fallen a 
young flower. 
They have murder'd my Emmet, my Emmet's no more.

A 
vic-timized young iirin. 
When first I 
went out to a 
ball, I 
met a 
lady fair, 
She'd had sonic words with her young man, and he likewise was 
there; [immense, 
She danced with me throughout the night, and thought the chance 
To aggravate and jealous make her chap at my expense ; 
• 
When going home he knocked me down, and then away he ran, 
And left me in the gutter there, a 
victimized young man. 
Near Oxford street a 
girl to me said, " James, how do you do ?" 
I 
said, " You have th' advantage, miss, for 1 
real ly don't know you." 
She thencommenced to scream aloud, and seeni'd with frenzy 
Sayingw,"i ld,
Wretch, you have deserted me, and where's the darling 
And there I 
like a 
dummy stood, for satisfied I 
am, 
I 
knew her not, I 
felt I 
wa7, a 
victimized young man. 
A crowd had now collected round, and all were crying shame! 
My hat was smash'd, my coat was torn before a 
policeman came. 
She said, "'flat is my husband, sir, who leaves : ne e•_nrvinv . eie," 
The Bobby said, " Oh I 
man and wife, then I 
shan't interfere." 
'When she had turn'd her back to speak, like a 
deer away I 
ran, 
The boys all following pelting me, a 
victimized young man. 
I 
refuge took behind a 
stall not far from Drury Lane, 
The mud and stones about me fell, and shower'd down like rain 
It grew so hot that out I 
got, and once more beat retreat, 
Half mad and smother'd o'er with mud, to the baths in Eudell 
Street; 
Like lightning through the door I 
fiasi2d, and didn't stop to semi 
The money-taker, for I 
felt, a 
victimized young man. 
Up-stairs I 
rushed, with worry flush'd, and didn't stop to read 
Directions as where I 
should go, I 
was too glad to be freed 
From the boys outside who wool.' leri-le and follow in my path, 
When all at once I 
found myself in the ladies' swimming bath; 
Some laugh'd, some screani'd, and all like ducks into the water man, 
And splasli'd me till I 
was wet through, a 
victimized young man. 
I 
know not whether they or I 
at first was most surprised, 
I 
very soon was bundled out, and of course apologized; 
An explanation settled all, I 
NVaS11 'd and brush'd my clothes, 
Then hail'd a 
cab, and hurt ied home much better you'll suppose 
I 
never now go out alone for satisfied I 
am, 
That if I (.IJ I'm sure to be, a ‘4.etlmized young man.

PADDY AT THE THEATRE. 
From the county of Monaghan lately I 
came, 
I'm a 
tinker by trade Larry Dooly's my name. 
My cousin, Tint Murphy, I 
met yesterday, 
Says he 
Mr. Doely ' II you go to the piay 
Derry down, down down derry down. 
" 
Is it the play that you mean, are you sure that you'r right I 
They're treating the town with Pizzaro, 
But the treat, as he called it, and the ono that I 
mean, 
Bad luck to his treat, it cost me all my tin. 
Derry down, down, down, derry down. 
Well, the green curtain drew up, and a 
lady I 
spied, 
When a 
man came to kiss her she scornfully cried, 
"Get out, you big blackguard, I'll bother your jig," 
When in comes Pizzaro with a 
grunt like a 
pig. 
Derry down, down, down, derry down. 
In the days of onld Gonry a 
long time ago, 
The Spaniards claimed war. . gainst Peru you know; 
They demanded its cash, its jewels and keys. ' 
When a 
boy they called Howler, says, " No. it you please." 
Derry down, down, down, derry down. 
Then Howler came on. like a 
day- star appeared, 
lie made a 
long speech, and the sogers all cheer'd, 
Says he, " heat well the Spaniaids, and do the neat thing, 
And then boys, stand up for your oonntry and King. 
Derry down, down, down, derry down. 
Then Mr. Murphy Alonzo, somehow went to jail, 
lie got out by a 
back door witheut giving bail, 
While Howler was jumpieg oe'r bridges and greens, 
lie was shot by some blackguard behind the big screens. 
Derry down, down, down, derry down. 
Then Bowler came forward, and with him a 
child, 
Looking all for the world like a 
man that was w:id: 
" 
Here's your gossoon, dear Cora, for it's my blood that's spilt. 
In &Twice of your child, blood an minds I'm kilt.' • 
Derry down, down, down, derry down. 
Then Alonzo, and Pizzaro. had a 
terrible fight, 
Pizzaro got killed that seemed perfectly right. 
For the audience came down with showers of applause, 
They were all enlisted in the Peruvian's cause. 
Derry down, down, down, derry down. 
Then Alonzo came forward and handsomely bowed, 
Saying, " Ladies and gentlemen," meaning the crowd! 
" 
By your kind permission, to morrow, then, 
We 
will murder Pizzarro over again." 
Derry down, down, down, derry down, 
DARBY KELLY. 
My rrandsire beat a 
drum so neat, 
His name was Darby Kelly, 0, 
No lad so true at rat tat too, 
At roll- call or revelie 0. 
When Marlboro's name first raised his fame. 
My granny beat the point of war, 
At Blenheim he, and Rainillie, 
Made ears to tintde fttr and near; 
For with his wri ,t, he'd such a 
twist, 
The girls would leer, you don't know how 
They laughed and sighed, and joked and cried, 
To hear him beat his row dow dow. 
With a 
row dow dow, 
They laughed and sighed, and joked and cried, 
To hear him, & c. 
A son lie had who Eke his dad, 
Was as tight a 
lad as any, 0, 
You ne'er would know, though you should go 
From Chester to Kielkenny, 0. 
When great Wolf died, his country's pride, 
To arms my dapper father beat, 
Each dale and hill remembered still, 
How loud, how long, how stout, how neat, 
With each drumstick, he had the trick, 
The girls would leer, you don't know how 
Their eyes would glisten, their ears would listen, 
To hear him beat the row dow dow. 
Their eyes, & c. 
Yet ere I 
wed, ne'er be it said, 
But what I 
the foe dare meet, 
With Wellington, old Erin's son, 
To help to make them beat retreat. 
Kinn. Arthur once, or l'm a 
dunce, 
Was called the hero of his age; 
But what was he to him we see, 
The Arthur of the modern page ? 
Who by the powers! from Lisbon's Towers, 
Their trophies bore to grace his brow, 
And made them prance, from Spain to France, 
With his English, Irish, row dow dow, 
With his row dow, 
And made them prance, from Spain to France. 
With his English, &c 
THE WAKE 
,OF MR. O'LEARY. 
A IR:—" King of the Cannibal Islands." 
In Ireland, so I've beard, 
To wake the dead they have a 
way, 
They get dead drunk, and on the tiure, do lay 
At the wake of Mr. O'Leary. 
Be wint quite dead, one Sunday night, 
*Which put his friends in sad affright, 
From this world he had taken flight, 
they drank his health with all their might. 
They danced and meled about. Oh, dear, 
For the whiskey made ' ern feel so queer, 
I'm sure they had the best of cheer, 
At tbe wake of Mr. O'Leary. 
CHORUS. 
Swearing, tearing, all the night, 
Putting whiskey out of sight, 
Good cheer, did all tlw guests invite, 
At the wake of Mr. O'Leary. 
Twas in the first fore under ground, 
'Where all the mirth, sure, did abound, ' 
And where the whiskey, quick wint round, 
At the wake of Mr. O'Leary. 
There was a 
policeman of his bate, 
Among the rest, Came to the fate, 
And rowled about like litany a 
baste, 
I'm sure he did not drink the haste. 
Saul's dead march, the piper played, 
But I 
am told he nc'er got paid, 
To spake the truth Pm not afraid, 
About the wake of Mr. O'Leary. 
Swearing, tearing, &IL 
'Twas in the middle of the fun, 
think just at the hour of one, 
The gooses they mighty quirk did run, 
From the wake of Mr. t I.vary. 
O'Leary, if I 
doo't mistake, 
Thought it high thee that lie should wake. 
'Witt fear, say:i he, I 
it nathe ' ern quake, 
So he gave the coffin a 
sodden shake, 
Thin etild Leary loml did cry, 
This waking me is all me eye, 
For I 
niver did iatind to die, 
I 
didn't says Mr. O'Leary. 
Swearing, tearing, dm 
For help the guests finite loud did call, 
()eh, murder, thieves, each one did bawl 
Och, wasn't there a 
precieus squall, 
At the wake of Mr. O'Leary. 
Old Leary thin did conic to view, 
And at the company he flew. 
And bate them all sere, black and blue, 
Och, ' pen my soul all this is throe. 
Some on crutches hobbled home, 
And swore again they lie ' Cr would roam, 
While others loud, with pains did groan, 
With the baling they got front O'Leary. 
Swearing, tearing, oke. 
GROVES OF BLARNEY. 
Am :— " 
The Last Rose of Summer." 
The groves of Blarney they are so charming, 
All by the vurling of swate silent brooks, 
All decked with roses which spontaneous grow thereN 
Planted in order by the swath rocky nooks. 
is there the daisy and swath carnation, 
The blooming pink and the rose so fair, 
Besides the 
and the datlyth.wn-dilly 
Flowers that scent the swate fragrant air. 
'Tis Lady Jeffers that owns this station, 
Like Alexander, or Queen Delon fair ; 
There's no commander throughout this nation 
For emulation can with her compare. 
There's castles round her that Ito uinepounder 
Could dare to pbtotter her place of strength; 
e- 
But Oliver Crammer( he did her pummel'. 
And made a 
breach in her battlement. 
There's grand walks there for contemplation, 
And conversation in swath solitude: 
'Tis there the lover may hear the dove, or 
The gentle plover in the afternoon : 
And if a 
young lady should be so engaging, 
As for to take a 
walk in their shady bowers, 
'Tis there her courter, 1w might transport her 
To some dark fort or under ground. 
'Tis there's the cave where no daylLht enteral, 
But bats. rats, and badgers are forever bred, 
All decked br natal.' which makes it swater 
Nor a 
coach and six. or a 
fiat her bed. 
*Tis there s 
the lakes that are stored with perches, 
And comely eels in the verdant mud, 
Besides the leeches, and tlw groves of beeches. 
All standing in order to guard the footL 
There is the stone that whoever kisses, 
lie never misses to grow eloquent— 
'Tis he may clamber to a 
lady's chamber, 
Or become a 
member of Parliament. 
A clever spouter, he'll sore turn out, or 
"An out-and-outer" to be let al, the 
Don't hope to hinder him, or to bewilder him— 
Sure he's a 
Pilgrim from the Blarney Stone. 
'Tis there's the kitchen, hangs many a 
flitch in, 
With the maids a-st itching- upon the stair; 
Och the bread and the hiskit,'„ the beef and the whisky, 
Faith I 
they'd make you frisky if you was but them. 
'Tis there you'd see Peg Murphy's daughter, 
A washing pratis flu-tient die dour. 
'With Nancy Casey, and Aunt Delaney, 
All blood relations, to my Lord Inmouglamore. 
There's statues gracing this nolde place in, 
All heathezu goddesses so fai r ; 
Bold. Neptune, Plutarch. and Nicodemns, 
All mother-naked in the- open air. 
So now te finish this bravo narration, 
Which I 
have not the genii for to entwine, 
But were I 
Homer or Nebuchadneezar, 
in every feature that I'd make it shimik. 
ERIN IS MY HOME. 
Oh, I 
have roamed in many lands 
And many friends I've met ; 
Not one fair scene or kindly smile 
Can this fond heart forget; 
But Fit confess that I'm content, 
No more I 
wish to roam ; 
Oh, steer my bark to Erin's isle,— 
For Eric is my home. 
Oh, steer my bark, &o. 
If England were my place of birth, 
I'd love her tranquil shore; 
But if Columbia were my home, 
Her freedom I'd adore. 
Tho' pleasant days in both I 
passed, 
I 
dream of days to come; 
Oh, steer my bark to Erin's isle,— 
For Erin is my home. 
Oh, steer my bark, &a. 
THE HARP 
THAT ONCE THRO' TARA'S HALLS. 
The harp that once thro' Tara's halls 
The soul of music shed, 
Now hangs as mute ryn Tara's walls, 
As if that soul were fled. 
Bo sleeps the pride of former days, 
So glory's thrill is o'er, 
And hearts that once beat high for praise, 
Now feel that pulse no more. 
No more to chiefs and ladies bright, 
The harp of Tar., swells ; 
The chord alone, that breaks at night, 
Its tale of ruin tells. 
Thus freedom now seldom wakes; 
The only throb it gives, 
Is when some heart indignant breaks 
To show that she still lives, 
BOWLD SOJER BOY. 
Oh, there's not a 
trade that's going, worth showing or knowing, 
Like that from glory growing, for a 
Bowld Sojer Boy ; 
Where right or left we go, sure you know, friend or foe, 
Will have the hand or toe from the Bowld Sojer Boy. 
There's not a 
town we march Ono', but ladies looking arch 
thro', 
The window panes will search thro', the ranks to find their 
jo3-. 
'While up the street, each girl you meet with look so sly, will 
cry My eye, 
But when we get the rout, bow they pout and they shout, 
While to the right about goes the Bowld Sojer Bey. 
'Tis then the ladies fair, in despair, tear their hair, 
But the devil a 
one I Care, says the Bowld Sojer Boy, 
For the world is all before us, whcre the landladies adore us, 
And ne'er refuse to score us, but chalk us up with joy. 
We taste her tap, we tear her cap, Oh, that's the chap for me, 
says she, 
'Oh, isn't he a 
darling, the Bowld Sojer Boy.' 
Then come along with me. Gramachree, and you'll see, 
How happy you will be with 3 
our Bowld Sojer Boy. 
Faith if you're up to fun, with me run, twill be done 
In the snapping of a 
gun, says the Bowld Sojer Boy. 
And ' tis then that without scandal, myself would proudly 
dandle, 
The little farthing candle, of our mutual love and joy. 
May his light shine as bright as mine, till in the line he'll 
blaze, and raise 
The glory of his corps, like a 
Bowld Sojer Boy.
