     Background noise:  The Local IWU 63 headquarters can be a bit noisy and this can be heard in the 
background.  It's an industrial building for the most part, so the cooling and heating system is a regular 
problem.   Occasionally, the building even generates a line noise that is impossible to keep off the 
recording.  Sometimes you can also hear people in the office section talking and laughing or somebody 
will walk into the room.

00:01   Bucky starts with short introduction.  
 
[Please tell me your name.]  Roy Williams.  [Could you tell me where you were born?]  Chicago, Illinois.  
[And what year?]  1939.  [Did you grow up in Chicago then?]  I did.  [What neighborhood and what area 
of Chicago?]  Around Cicero and North Avenue.  [How did you get into working in the ironworking?]  
My Dad was an ironworker.  [What kind of work did he do in the ironworkers?]  Set steel. Like all of us.  
[When did you start?   Did you get out of high school and go to work?]  I come out of high school in ’56 
and work was very good.  I went to work for my father.  I served a four year apprenticeship.   
[Was that in Lo cal #63 or one of the other locals?]  Yeah.  55 years this year, October 1st, it will be 
50…55 years.  [Wow.  Do you remember the first job you did?]  I do.  [What was that?]  My father was 
running the job, Wilson’s Sporting Goods in River Grove, Illinois, which is a suburb out here.  [Yeah.]  
And ahh, I went out to work out there with him and a bunch of other fellas.  They tried to teach me the 
trade on the job and then going to school.  Made out pretty good.   
 
 
1:33  [What kind of work did they have you do in those days?]  Mostly helping the journeymen because I 
didn’t know anything.  The journeymen, the old timers that I worked with, they tried to teach you.  Of 
course, because of my father, they tried to teach me a little bit more than what I could really learn.  Back 
then there was probably seven certified welders in the whole local.  The local was only about 750 people 
at that time.  So welding was the big thing.  We needed welders.  So they developed a squad,  they didn't 
develop 'em. Washburn Trade School.  We went down to the Washburn Trade School.  They had 
instructors down there for us.  As the years went on, we all became certified welders.  That’s how you 
made your money.  [Yeah.  So did you do a lot of welding stuff, is that primarily what you did?]  Yeah.  
[And after working on the Wilson job, what kind of stuff did you do after that?]  From there I was…  That 
job finished up and they sent me downtown to a 25-story building.  And I had never been up in the air 
before because this was a short…  This was a one story building at Wilson.  So when I went down there, 
it was 25 stories and…you had to go up with the building.  That was another experience.  Its gonna make 
you or break you.  [Do you get used to it pretty fast or…?]  You had to back then, because they didn’t 
have safety equipment that we have today.  Today you have all kinds of harnesses and safety belts and 
hard hats and…  Back then they had nothing…  [Is that right…]  You didn’t have anything…safety wise. 
 
3:20  [Were there a lot of guys that got hurt on the job back then?]  Oh yeah.  Yeah. Ahh. As the years 
went on, I was still in the apprentices…  That job finished up.  We went up to Fisk Powerhouse on 22nd 
and Carpenter.  And that was a bad one.  I seen guys get killed there.  Young guys.  Not ironworkers, they 
were from a different craft.  But a lot of guys got hurt there.  That was a tough one.  But as the years 
progressed, more and more safety conscious.  The insurance companies got involved more.  Demanded 
that we have safety equipment and demanded that we wear it.  A lot of times when we’d get it on the job, 
guys would refuse to wear it, because it was too cumbersome.  You felt,   if you were going to fall, you 
could hold on to yourself rather than trip over a rope or something else that you're tied off on.  But today 
it’s a different story.  You’ve got to be tied off or you’re out of work you know, if you’re on a high rise, 
which is good.  It’s a good law.  [Were there some jobs you worked on that were really fun or you 
remember well?  Certain buildings, construction sites?]  They were all kind of fun when I worked out in 
the field, because you were with the different guys.  The men made the difference.  Because they worked 
together, they’d help each other.  You had fun that way.  Back then, they don’t have the, they didn’t have 
the equipment that they have today.  So most of it was what we call bull work.  Pick it up and go with it.  
Today they have cranes and different chain falls and things of that nature.  But it was very interesting and 
I enjoyed it for the times I worked out there.  Ahh…  Then probably…  I mean…   
 
5:40    My father was an officer here and when he retired, the new group that was coming in asked me to 
run with them.  And I was…about 20 years old, 22 years old, something like that.  So I ran on their ticket 
and I won only because of my father’s name.  His name and my name were the same.  And he had a 
pretty good record.  [Was he a business agent?]  No, no.  He was on the Executive Board for the local for 
many years.  I ran as a trustee, which was the bottom of the barrel.  I won that.  I was there for two years.  
Then I ran for the Executive Board.  I was on the Executive Board for nine years.  Then they wanted me 
to run for business agent.  So I did that.  I ran for that and won that.  I was a business agent for seven 
years.  The business manager at that time was retiring and they wanted me to move up to business 
manager.  So I was the business manager then.  I got elected to that.  I was in there for ten years.  The 
president of our International at that time was trying to set up an ornamental department.  There’s only 2 
ornamental locals in our International; Chicago, this local here and one in New York.  He asked me to set 
it up and run it, come to Washington, and run the department, which I did.  I took that job.  I had an office 
here and one in Washington.  And traveled the country and that lasted about ten years and I got tired.  I 
said, “That’s it.”  I had enough traveling.  So then I retired. 
 
7:38   [When you were a trustee, what kind of work did a trustee do and then would you still be working?]  
Yeah, I still worked in the field.  You come in to the union meetings once a month as a trustee.  When the 
members would vote to pay the bills, the trustee would go over all the bills and make sure that there’s 
nobody fooling around with anything.  And if the bills were right, I’d sign it.  There were three trustees.  I 
was one of them.  [And then when you got on the Executive Board.  Is that a paid position?]  Oh yeah.  
We were making a ton of money back in them days.  We’d make $4 a month and that’s no lie.  And when 
my relatives heard that I was on the Executive Board, they said, “Well, what are you making?”  I said, 
“Four bucks.”  And then they’d laugh at you.  Back when they established a $4 rate, that was for gas, for 
you to come from wherever you were coming from to go to the meeting.  That’s how they figured it.  
They never changed it for years.  So anybody that ran, they didn’t run for the money because there was no 
money involved.  But the local didn’t really have any money back then…you know…  Nobody was ever 
making any money.  So then when I became, well I was on the Executive Board for nine years, when I 
became business agent, we started accumulating some money.  I said, this is a slap in the face to the 
members and to the officers.  We were the highest paid.  We were getting $4.  The other guys were 
getting $2.  So where could you go for $2?  You can’t buy gas for $2.  So I got…  When we accumulated 
enough money, I put a resolution on the floor and we got everything raised so everybody…  They weren’t 
making much.  They were making $30 I think then, which would fill up your gas tank, because we were 
required to go to all the funerals…  Not funerals, but their wakes.  A member died or got killed, an officer 
was required to go to their wakes.  That helped pay for some of the gas.  Plus on the Executive Board, you 
had two meetings a month.  You had to come in here second Thursday of the month and the last Friday of 
the month for the meetings.  Last Friday of the month was the union meeting as well.  [And when you 
became a business agent, was that a full time position then?]  Yeah.  I didn’t work in the field after that 
because I was always in here.  You were in the field chasing bad jobs. Jurisdictional problems, non-union 
problems and stuff like that.  But you weren’t working on the iron.  You weren’t working with the tools.  
[You go around to the different job sites.]  I wore a suit every day then.   
 
10:22  [What were the big jurisdictional fights you had or disputes?  Were there certain unions you guys 
were always butting heads with?]  Oh yeah, oh yeah.  Mainly with the carpenters.  Carpenters were 
always trying to steal our work.  [Yeah.]  Glazers, a couple of times with the glazers.  [Is that with the 
window stuff?]  Yeah.  [They were in competition with you to put that in?]  Yeah.  [How did the 
carpenters, how did that come in?  What were they doing that was in your jurisdiction?]  They would get, 
like, punch out windows, stuff like that.  They’d do anything.  I mean, anything that they got assigned to 
do, whether it was theirs or not, and if we caught ‘em, we’d take ‘em to the Board.  We had a Chicago 
Joint Conference Board and I would have to make up the cases here.  And I’d take it down to the Board, 
and fight it before an arbitration board.  I did the same thing when I went to work for the International.  
That’s one of the reasons why they hired me, was because of my expertise, supposedly, on jurisdiction.  
Because I could…  Back then I could remember everything.  Today I can’t remember my own name.  [Do 
you remember what all the jurisdictions were?]  Yeah.  [And how specific they were?  Yeah.]  You had to 
back then.  I’m not bragging.  I don’t want to sound like I’m bragging but I had about 35 jurisdiction 
disputes and won every one of them.  I was pretty good at what I did, not only for this local but for the 
International too.  Because anytime you win a case with the International, which had to be heard in 
Washington DC, that went all over the North America.  So if you won a case on a certain item, you’d 
send that out to all the different locals in North America, that are ironworker locals.  Then they could go 
after that work,  because now you had evidence saying that we had the jurisdiction of the dispute, we won 
that dispute.  [Sort of like when you make a law case, you set a precedent.]  Exactly.  […for the others to 
follow.]  Right.  So don’t be afraid to go after it, because we have evidence that we won this case, that’s 
your work.  But that worked well, very well, so we were really successful.   We put a lot of ironworkers to 
work and that was my main goal when I took the job.  When I took the job, as long as I don’t get no 
interference from anybody else--I told the general president--if I don’t get any interference from anybody 
else, I’m not moving.  I’m not moving out of Chicago because everybody had to move from Washington.  
I’m not living out of Chicago.  I says, “I’ll open an office here.”  I says, “I can be on a plane at O’Hare 
Field and can be anywhere in the United States faster than I can out of Washington to handle any 
problems that might arise.  [He let you do that…]  The boss says, “Go get an office.  Get a secretary.  Do 
what you gotta do.”  We were very successful.  I had the job two months and I had a heart attack.  
[LAUGHTER. That’s how successful you were, right?]  Yeah, I was real successful.  I had a heart attack.  
I was off work for about three months.  I had bypass surgery and then…they screwed up my lung and 
everything.  But when I came back, I was like a new man.  Just worked night and day, I loved it.  I really 
enjoyed the hell out of it.  I felt good, then I felt good.  I got a lot of help.  Anytime I picked up the phone 
and I needed help in a certain state or city or something that I wasn’t familiar with, and if I had to go in 
there on a jurisdictional dispute, I just pick up the phone and call the guy in that area and that guy would 
be standing there at the airport waiting for me to come, because they knew I was there to help ‘em.  We 
worked very well that way.  I really enjoyed the work. 
 
14:30 But then I had to go back in after probably 9 ½ years, back on the table.  They put three more stints 
in me.  My cardiologist says, “Do you really need this job?”  I says, “No, not really.”  He says, “Can you 
afford to retire?”  I says, “Yeah.”  He says, “I suggest you do that.”  So when I came back, I called the 
boss.  I had a new boss by then.  I told him, I says “I’m gonna retire.”  “No, no no. Sit in Chicago,” he 
says.  “Just sit at your desk.  You don’t have to do nothin’ but answer phones.  And if you don’t want to 
do that, don’t answer the phones.  But if somebody calls you with a problem, could you…?”  And he had 
another guy from here, one of the business agents, hired him as my assistant.  And…kind of taught him a 
little bit, the jurisdiction part of it.  He was a go-getter.  He was a tough kid and young.  Today he’s the 
general secretary of this International.  So that’ll tell you the caliber a guy he is.  So then when I seen he 
could handle it, I said, “That’s it.  I quit.  If you’ve got a problem, call me at home…”  I live not even two 
miles from the office.  I says, “Call me at home or whatever.  I’ll come and help you with anything.”  And 
he did.  For the first year he had a few problems.  I worked with him there and I worked with him over 
here on jurisdiction disputes and stuff like that.  Helped him a little bit.  Because he’s a pretty smart guy, I 
didn’t really have to do much.  He really knew what to do.  Some of the older jurisdictional disputes that 
got lost somewhere along the line from here, from years back.  I could still remember them, but they were 
not on file.  Somebody took them out of the files.  So I helped him that way.  Other than that, he could 
handle it all himself.  He’s doing an excellent job.   
 
16:39  [Did you have to deal with strikes locally, like especially if you were the business agent?] Yeah, I 
negotiated a lot of contracts.  I never put our guys on the street once.  I never believed in that.  I said, “If 
we can’t just sit down like men, we’re going to get this resolved one way or another.  I don’t want to put 
people out of work.  Okay?  If we have to extend the contract for a week or two while we still negotiate, 
we’ll do that.”  It will be retroactive back, it was always June 1st.  We did that two times.  Always got 
what we wanted.  Had a good crew negotiating with me.   They were all the ironworkers.  We had some 
very good contractors.  [So even on a small…or on a job site, you never had to call like a one day strike 
and have a bunch of scabs?  You worked it out?]  We’d put up a picket line once in a while on them.  
Yeah.  [Put some pressure on them.]  One day maybe, because this is a union town.  Chicago was always 
a union town.  Back when I was here, we very, very, very seldom had a union problem.  Non-union 
problem.  Today it’s, there’s a lot of them out there.  Different type of people, you know.  We had…  If 
we had one or two every year…ah…  I know when I started as a business agent, I had to solve…  They 
gave me the soft side because I was the youngest guy.  I had one non-union contractor and within one 
year, I had him out of business.  He wanted them to conform and everything else.  He didn’t want to 
conform.  [Then he was gone.]  He went out of business. 
 
18:32  [What do you think is the biggest change in your work since when you started…or even when your 
Dad started til now, for the workers themselves.  What is the biggest changes?  Is it safety?]  Technology 
changes.  Back then, when you started a job, the first thing you do is put a gang box.  Put all your tools in 
and your clothes and everything else in.  That’d be the first thing comes on the job.  Because you knew 
you were going to be on that job for a long time.  Today, they re-fashioned all of the materials. They use 
cranes.  New technologies.  Now they give you a pick up truck.  And you go there with a pick up truck 
with a welding machine and cutting torch and all the equipment on the truck, and you’re in and out of 
there ya know quite often.  You can be there today and gone tomorrow.  That’s the way they program is 
run today.  Big difference.  Back then, you’d see a truck come up and it would be loaded with iron.  
You’d have to take and unload that truck, all the iron, by hand.  Nobody ever had a crane or anything.  So 
we all had to do it by hand all the time.  Today, they’ll send a big truck out with all the iron and it's 
already fabricated.  Most of the time.  It’s all fabricated, you pick it up with a crane, you set it, and you’re 
out of there, in a day or two.  Big difference.  Back then, there was never any safety.  Today, they’re all 
safety conscious, which is very good.  Drug testing.  Back then there was no drugs.  Guys would drink, 
but there was no drugs. None that we knew of back then.  And as years went on, even when I was here, 
contractors wanted a drug testing program.  I was all for that.  And we had, at that time, some of the kids 
were coming in were on that funny stuff.  People get hurt and it wasn’t their fault because they’re working 
with somebody that was high.  And finally we had to do something.  I says I was all for it.  A lot of my 
members were against it.  Anybody who was against it, must have a reason I said.  What are you afraid 
of?  So. 
 
21:00  [What about when you started, I’m curious too about when your Dad started, were there still Polish 
groups of workers or Italians or whatever, or was that already kind of disappearing by the time you came 
on?]  Yeah, that was…  They had everything back then.  In my father’s day, they were all boxers, they 
were all fighters, you know?  But that kind of went by the wayside after awhile.  They all stuck together.  
I mean, nobody…  You’d go out after a union meeting and go to a bar.  Our hall used to be at 160 North 
Halsted Street back then.  You go over after union meeting, they’d go to the bar, and someone got out of 
line and picked on an ironworker.  He had to take on the whole bar, because it was all ironworkers.   And 
that’s the way it was back then.  Today it’s a little bit different.  People are spread out after meetings and 
that.     
 
22:04  [When you first started out on a job, did old timers play jokes on you?]  Oh yeah.  The boss was 
my father so they, they played some games with me.  But that…  Whether it was…not because of my 
father or anything, they did it to everybody.  We did the same thing when I was a journeyman working in 
the field.  We’d get some new kids coming in and you’d send him for a tool that there was no such thing 
as that tool.  You’d send him up five floors or down five floors.  You'd have 'em run his ass off all day 
long, looking for the same tool that there was no such thing.  But then they’d catch on.  Then they did the 
same thing as kids came up through the ranks.  But nobody ever got hurt doing that. 
 
23:00  [Did you guys have any ritual or anything when you finished a job?  Some of the sky scrapers …]  
Yeah, they’d top it off.  On the big jobs, we’d top it off.  We had little beer parties, stuff like that, on most 
of the big jobs that I worked on.  I worked on, with one guy that ran a lot of big work.  I was always one 
of his foremen.  We’d always have…get the job done safely and at the end we’d have a little beer party 
for the guys with some food.  Make sure everybody got home alright, no accidents and nobody got hurt.  
That was our main goal.   
 
23:45  [Right now it seems like the economy really having a has a negative impact on the construction 
business in general.]  Yeah.  [What’s your prognosis for the future of the ironworkers?  Is it still pretty 
good?]  I used to be able to project work when I was working, a year down the line, two years. You had to 
do that when you were sitting in that chair in there and you’d say, “Okay.  I got this coming up next year.  
Two years from now, I’ve got this coming.”  You could see the light at the end of the tunnel.  If I needed 
more men, if I needed more welders, whatever I needed.  Today, there is no light at the end of the tunnel.  
I don’t see nothing.  Of course, I’m not in the know like I used to be either,  because I’ve been away from 
it now.  But talking to with the business manager here now, Ray Dean, good kid, Ray Dean say you don’t 
see nothing coming either.  Until they get this economy going, nothing is going to happen.  Nobody can 
build anything.  Nobody’s got the money. They're holding back.  Today you’ve got to have 55% of the 
finance, I think it’s 55% of the building occupied before you dig a hole.  Who the hell is doing that 
because of all the vacant property that’s down there now?  Who’s going to build anything?  Most of our 
work is downtown basically.  I don’t see much work out there and I’ve been in it 55 years and this is the 
worst I’ve ever seen.  I’ve seen some bad years back in the early 60s…where there was a lot of guys out 
of work, but you could see that work was coming, 6-8 months down the line.  I see no work out there 
today and I must have 300 guys out of work now.  Some of these kids that are in here haven’t worked in a 
couple of years.  I’ve been told some of the other crafts, guys that are in their early 40s, their business 
managers are telling 'em to go find work some place else.  There is no work.  Electricians, plumbers, there 
is no work.  [Is that all across the country?]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It’s not good.  It’s not good.  We got our 
convention coming here next month, so we’re going to learn more about what’s going on around the 
country.  A kid that worked with me, who is second in command now, I seen him last week at his 
daughter’s wedding.  I asked him how things were going in his part of the country and he said, “Just like 
Chicago.  It’s dead.”  That’s about all I know. 
 
26:42  [You’ve answered all my questions.  Is there anything you want to talk about?]  No.  It’s been a 
good run for a lot of ironworkers.  I can see all them guys sitting out there.  They all stuck together over 
the years.  Sometimes we get in an argument with each other but that was the extent of it.  Some guys, 
through politics, they get mad and leave and never come back again.  And that’s human nature.  But for 
the best part, it has been wonderful.  If you talk to any of the guys out there and ask them and I bet they’d 
say the same thing.  It’s been a wonderful future…   Not for me. I’m through.  I’m in the 4th quarter and 
the game is over.  GIGGLE  I’ve got two grandsons that are coming out Saturday to take the apprentice 
test.  [Cool.]  Whether they make it or not, I don’t know.  My nephew’s two kids.  He’s a business agent 
here and two of his kids are coming in and taking tests too, the apprentice test.  One just finished Loyola.  
Smart as can be. Can’t get a job no where.  Do you know what I mean?  Maybe I’ll be an ironworker.   I 
said, “Maybe my ass.  You’ve got to pass the test.”  “I can pass any test.” “We’ll see.”  LAUGHTER  But 
that’s where it’s at.  Even if they pass the test, if they take 10 apprentices in a year, it’ll be a lot.  I don’t 
see them takin’ ‘em because there’s no work.  No we’re down.  We don’t have any first, second or third 
year apprentices.  We haven’t taken any in because there was no work.  So they want to try to bring a 
couple in.  They’ll force a contractor to take ‘em, if need be because you should have some.  You’ve got 
to keep the trade going and that’s the best way.  I don’t know if you’ve been in the back at the school.  [I 
have, yes, it’s nice.  It’s great.]  And seen the school.  Ray’s done a great job, but he’s got the money to 
do it.  Back when I was there, we were stealing from Peter to pay Paul.  We couldn’t pay the rent.  But 
he’s got money in there now, in the general fund, and they can do these things.  They’ve just built a big 
addition on there.  I think it cost them $2 million.  That’s all paid for.  They’re doing very well, but 
they’re working hard.  They have to.  That’s about all I can tell you unless you need something specific.  
[No, that’s great.  I appreciate your time.]  It was a pleasure meeting you.
