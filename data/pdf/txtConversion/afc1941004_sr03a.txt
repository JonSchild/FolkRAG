"Man-on-the-Street", Washington, D.C., December 8, 1941
AFS 6359 A
Location: possibly outside the billiard hall
Unidentified man: Are you hooked up?
Alan Lomax: Do you know what you're going to talk about?
Unidentified Man: Well, all I have to say is, they could have easily stayed out of this. They did the
wrong thing by electing President Roosevelt. Although he helped some, he helped a whole lot, but
still therefore he should have kept out of it. He could have easily made some arrangement for that
country over there.
Alan Lomax: Pretty hard to make arrangements when somebody attacks you with a fleet of armors.
Unidentified Man: No. Well, the onliest word to that is fight back to that, but still he could have made
some, you know what I mean, progress or something like that. He could have talked it out with them
and explain it better and maybe they wouldn't did that.
Alan Lomax: But, while he was talking to them, they came over and attacked us. They planned it two
weeks in advance while they sent their [air forces (?)].
Unidentified Man: Two weeks in advance?
Alan Lomax: Sure. You haven't been reading the papers.
Unidentified Man: I've been reading the paper, but still if he had argued about the German and
that war over there, I'd still don't think it would have been. They might have been willing to listen to
reason of course we don't know the true story ourselves. We only have what we know and what we
hear and all that jive.
Alan Lomax: What are you going to do now about it yourself?
Unidentified Man: Well, the best thing I can do is enlist. On this side, naturally. But still, there's
somebody up there who know it's wrong, but ??? won't tell us. But still he was wrong ???
Alan Lomax: You're going to go ahead and fight anyway?

Unidentified Man: Yeah, I'm going to fight anyway.
Alan Lomax: OK, thank you.
Unidentified man: Fight on anybody's side, I don't care [several voices at once].
Unidentified man: Victory
Unidentified man: There might be a few more.
Alan Lomax: Well, I guess we've got you pretty well.
Alan Lomax: Anybody else here want to say anything? All right.
