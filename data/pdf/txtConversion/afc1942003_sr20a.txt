Cut A1
C. R. Jabbers: C. R. Jabbers, Elon College, North Carolina. Mr. President, it seems foolish for me to try
to tell a man as smart as you are something he doesn't already know. I'm only a painter, of course,
so was Hitler, but I make my living by working and instead of murdering and robbing other people.
I've thought and I've had a lot of ideas rather, in different times and I thought I would mention
and did think of writing to you, but in the course of twenty-four hours it usually comes out in print
showing that you had thought of it before I had.
I'd like to mention a few things though, that is on my mind. That is, I think it would be nice if to
put defense factories in every locality as near as possible. Especially through the Carolinas. Here,
Americanism is about one hundred percent and you can entrust anyone here to guard anything
from a spy to United States mint.
I think that's about all ???.
Cut A2
Larestein Wagoner: Larestein Wagoner, Route 4, Burlington, NC. Mr. President, I'm just a carpenter
and you hear quite a lot on the job about the war and it seems that if the rest of the USA is as much
with you as we are just give us a job and we'll do it. For we can't take a chance with this country of
ours and the freedom we have.
Cut A3
T. O. Sharp: My name is T. O. Sharp, Burlington, North Carolina. Mr. President, just to say I never was
so proud of my country as I am today.
Now you can say I can ??? it. [said to interviewer]
Cut A4
T. O. Sharp: This is T. O. Sharp, Burlington, North Carolina. Mr. President, just to say I never was so
proud of my country as I am today. I consider it the greatest privilege of my life to have a part in
winning the act which we have undertaken. I do not term it a sacrifice on my part, but an opportunity
"Dear Mr. President", Alamance County, North Carolina, January or February 1942 http://www.loc.gov/item/afc1942003_sr20
to render service second to that honor of Christ dying on the cross in [earnest (?)] of mankind. There
is no doubt of final victory.
Cut A5
Herman Shepherd: This here is Herman Shepherd talking. I run a little service station and grocery
store, and my address is Burlington, Route 4. Naturally I hear a lot of people talking and the main
subject is about the war. Everybody seems mighty calm and taking it mighty easy.
