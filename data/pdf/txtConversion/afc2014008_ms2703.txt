But Betsy ran home,-- she was crying,  they say,--
 
And Mrs. Perkins ne'er had a small caller that day.
 
April 19 30,
 
One day mother and nursy and me
 
Made up a wonderful land.
 
It had chocolate chimneys an4 lemonade lakes
 
And wonderful shugary sand.
 
And nurse said that spinach would grow on the trees
 
And all little children would ask for it "please!"
 
But I don't like spinach, so mother and me
 
Made gumdrops grow on a gingerbread tree!

dancing and goes up to him.)
 
I
 
Mary;
 What a funny little dance,
 
Bob:
 (Turns to her) Who in the world are you?
 
Mary:
 I
'm Mary.  You know I live in the old red house with t
I
 
stone wall around it,
 
Bob:
 Oh,  I know.  Where I sweep the chimneys often.
 
Mary:
 Yes
 And I Know you.  You are Bob, the chimney-sweep,
 
aren't you?  What did you say you wanted in that song p
 
you were singing?
 
Bob:
 It was a Magic Broom that would sweep chimneys for me
 
that I could go and play.
 
Mary:  ,
 If there is a broom like that it must be in Fairyland.
 
Bob:
 But how do you go to Fairyland?  Do you go up a chimney
 
to go there?  The lngest chimney I ever went up is Mr
,4/
 
Brown's,
 It is awful long and I went to the top t
u
;t I
 
didn't find any Fairyland.
 
Mary:
 You little goose!  You don't go to Fairyland by &oin
 
up a chimney!  The way you get there is to stand on
 
that rock there and wish real hard to go, and maybe you
 
can.  It must be at midnight of Midsummer's  4c4'n ight,
 
Bob:
 Let
's try it.  When is Midsummer's A oJnight j
 
Mary:
 Why,  it's tonight.  Let's go wish now,
 
(They stand on the stone and take hands)
 
Both:
 We wish we were in Fairyland!  We wish we  were in Fai
 
land!  We wish we,  were in . Pairylandj  (They sit down
 
on the stone)
 
Bob:  How do fairies live, Mary.
 I want to know sboUt Fairyland,
 
Mary sings:
 
Hollyhocks are fairy gowns;
 
Poppies, too; poppies, toc,
 
Sashes are all mac
ic e  gra s,
 
Ornaments of blue.
 
Pea-pod shells a:  fairy t
cats,
 
Rose petals are the seats.
 
They live on dew and j s amine,
 
They never would th ink of meats!
 
A lesson in fairy ettiquette is:
 
Ornaments must be blue.
 
A fairy told me this last night
 
And I know she told me true.
