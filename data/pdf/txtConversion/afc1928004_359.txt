AIR. "That's where you make a 
mistake." 
I'LL tell you somethings that happen, 
Most every day of our lives, 
They come in sonic way or other, 
Like bees flying into their hives. 
They conic in all sorts of fashion, 
And sometimes they make a 
long stay, 
But keep a 
still tongue in your head, my dear boys, 
And don't give yourself away. 
CHORUF. 
It's the very worst thing you can think of, 
No matter what other folks say, 
Don't be a 
fool, be as dumb as a 
mule 
And don't give yourself away. 
If you're poor, and ain't got a 
dollar. 
Just keep a 
stiff upper lip, 
Have a 
smile and a 
laugh for your neighbor, 
Don't let your tongue even slip. 
One word of your poor circumstances. 
He'll think you've a 
nice pleasant way, 
You've a 
chance then to make a 
nice borrow you know, 
But don't give yourself away. 
It's the very, S:c. 
If you're a 
Lawyer, or Doctor or Actor, 
And clever in business or art. 
And you blow it over all creation, 
Don't think for a 
moment its smart. 
Each man you must know has an opinion, 
And a 
right to express it you say, 
So he tells all his friends and relations he meets 
That you gave yourself away. 
It's the very, & c. 
You fall in love like other mortals, 
With a 
girl that's modest and sweet, 
Don't act like a 
fop or a 
novelle. 
Or she'll usher you in the street. 
But treat her you know like a 
lady, 
Be familiar, and witty and gay, 
And you'll find she will call you her dumpling so sweet, 
But don't give yourself away. 
It's the very, t
rzc.

CHATHAM STREET SQUARE. 
Written by NED HARRIGAN. 
I 
landed from Ireland quite rosy and fat, 
In the ship Robert Walker, wid Mary and Pat: 
From swate Castle Garden to Broadway I 
whit: 
To see the great city, I 
hadn't a 
eint. 
Whin I 
got to the park, shure I 
saw a 
big light, 
'Twas the clock in the steeple that lighted the night: 
Whin I 
crossed over the street, oh, great trouble Was there, 
'Twas Jews sellin' coats down in Chatham Street Sq.are. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the great trouble, oh, the great trouble, 
The trouble of passin' down Chatham Streo, Square. 
There was Yankees an' Frinchmin, an' Prussians an' Dutch, 
Was axing one 'question, an' that was " how much?" 
Money was wanted for jackets an' coats, 
That the Jews warranted was from skins of the goats; 
Such bundles of clothes 'twas a 
sight for to see, 
Whin convanientiv some one caught hold of me; 
I 
turned an' I 
looked—I 
was met with a 
stare— 
'Twas a 
Jew sellin' clothes down in Chatham Street Square. 
Oh, tl..# great trouble, etc. 
I 
wint in the store as green as new grass, 
For ould Nebacodnezzer himself couldn't pass; 
Nothin' would do inc but try on a 
suit, 
Wid a 
pair of suspinders and collars tt, boot. 
Thin I 
axed the Hebrew if he gave any trust, 
At the same time I 
stretched, an' the coat gave a 
bust, 
Thin he wanted tin dollars at once fo., 
the tare, 
Which created a 
ruction in Chatham Street Square. 
Oh, the great trouble, etc. 
They called me a 
Paddy, an' many hard names, 
They brought in a 
crowd for to spill out my brains; 
'Twas thin I 
got mad, an' I 
soon did begin 
To put heads on the blaggards just as they came in, 
Whin all of a 
sudden such a 
whelt did I 
meet, 
I 
wint over their heads clear into the street; 
Wid a 
new suit on my back, sure what did I 
care, 
There's where I 
got even on Chatham Street Square. 
Oh, the great trouble, etc.

'Twas every way you continually go, 
The divil the wink did we slape on the voyage,

Sung in En. HARRIGAN .S Irish Drama, " Shamus O'Brien." 
Oh, Irish boys and girls, draw near, 
We'd whisper soft to ye; 
The way we love, like turtle doves 
Upon a 
bush or tree. 
Between there's no conceit, 
Oh, it really is a 
treat, 
To sit beside the flowing tide, 
Of the lakes of sweet Killarney.

Oh, beautiful Killarney. 
They say America's mighty great, 
And has its br@oks and lakes, 
A man might live in royal state, 
Be fed on ducks and drakes; 
But here we'll be content, 
As long as we have our rent. 
And stay at home, and never roam 
From the lakes of sweet Killarney. 
Killarney, etc. 
The little spec that's on the sea, 
They call it Ireland, 
It's large enough to shelter we, 
And for it we do stand; 
For the Lord above is just, 
At some future day we must 
Rule every mile in that happy isle. 
Where flows the sweet Killarney.

MARY, 
Written by Ell. HARRIGAN. 
Oh, Mary, dear Mary, oh, come back to me,

But cold is the welcome you now give tome; 
Is there nought, then, in parting, or nought in long years, 
Is there nought then in absence, I've mourned too with tears? 
For the gold of the stranger you have left me in pain, 
For the jewel of hope I 
have come back again; 
But ' tis only to meet thee, like a 
dew- drop from high, 
With the sunbeam it loved, then heart-broken to die. 
Oh, Mary, dear Mary, oh, turn not away, 
Sure ' tis joking you are in the sunshine to- day; 
Yet now ' twould he pleasant to meet with a 
smile, 
To show you were laughing and loving the while. 
Oh, let me not lose all my dreams of the past, 
The hope of the future, where joy, too, is cast; 
Let thy love be my lamp, and I'll worship its light, 
Till the heart that's Mimed be hushed in dark, night. 
Oh, Mary, dear Mary, oh, come back to me, 
Oh, give, then, mavourneen, kind welcome to me.

WE are the famous Fusileers you've heard so much about; 
We make the street resound with cheers, whenever we turn 
out! 
Our uniform is neat and gay, the finest in the land; 
We muster in the Fourteenth Ward, on Bow'ry Street, near 
Grand; 
Our Captain's name is Doherty, a 
finer lad you never se ,; 
Sure he's always gay and free, and he no danger fears! 
See him marching thro' the street, watch the motion of his feet 
No crowd that walks can ever beat the Doherty Fusileers! 
CHORUS. 
Eyes front! toe the line! mind the step, and keep in time! 
.';.1w the band begins to play, the air is full of cheers! 
Right wheel ! mind your eye! " Pipe" the girls upon the sly; 
• 
Aint they grand" the people cry, the Doherty Fusileers! 
It's special duty we perform, and each invited guest 
We fill with Casey's whiskey, sure, that same is of the best! 
The Duke Alexis we received, from far across the " sa." 
And Ka:ico, from the Sandwich Isles, we sported on Broadway 
16 
Then the royal Japanese Flag's a 
waving in the breeze, 
Erin's Harp, the Stars an Stripes, that flag we love so dear! 
Then together, " cheek by jowl" it was grand, upon my soul 
Sure; half the glory can't be told, of the Doherty Fusileers! 
CHORUS. — Eyes front, & e. 
Upon the seventeenth of March you'll see us, ev'ry

For that's the day of all, my boys, to Irishmen so dear; 
St. Patrick's praises, then, are sung around on ev'ry hand; 
And we fall in line, and gayly time the music of the band: 
"Garryowen," sweet and gay, " Awkward Squad," and 
"Patrick's day," 
Now the band begins to play, the air is full of cheers! 
Pretty girls upon us gaze,—say we have such martial ways;

Performed by HARRIGAN A, 
HART. 
OH, the Higginbottom Sisters are here, 
We came from New Hampshire, 
We feel tarnation queer, 
Our bosoms are wrapped in fire. 
We're descendants from the real old stock, 
Who landed on Columbia's shore, 
*Way down thar on Plymouth Rock. 
Where the waves and breakers roar. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! Higginbottom, 
We declare it's really shocking— 
There's no young fellow in the neighborhood 
Will marry a 
Higginbottom. 
Oh, the world. in. its wicked ways, 
Has caused -us many a 
pain; 
We don't want any praise 
Or exaltation or fame. 
Our ancestors did shed,their blood, 
In the revolutionary war; 
They perished like a 
flower in the bud, 
Oh, you might have heard it before. 
Oh, Higginbottom, etc.

WE

None better sure you could find, 
To twirl the twig and drink strong whiskey, 
Or box a

If the four-leaved shamrock we could get now, 
All bare footed-cripples should be shod, 
No poor needle women should starving sit down, 
But be gay like the boys that carry the hod. 
CHORUS. 
So drink success to Irish laborers, 
Just new over from the sod, 
All we want is laborer's wages, 
We're the boys can carry the hods 
Sure we'r for freedom of opinion, 
None should toil but three hours a 
day, 
We should have no tax in this dominion, 
But men get just three times the pay. 
All should have roast beef and less salt coo 
Pigs bigget than cows in styes shout squeeck now, 
For to fatten the boys that carry the hod. 
So drink success, itc. 
Good clothes and money should gladden the nation. 
Anu bonestb rewarded be; 
Starvation should have no relation. 
But Slaves black and white should all be free 
Then laugh and sinp with voice:- charming, 
In spite of every laug tit' 
Just shoulder these ano yo : IT Mu no harm, 
In these Irish boys that carry tuc hods.

10 cents. 
Oh! we've parted from each other, 
And our dream of love is o'er. 
That bright dream was too beautiful to last. 
And we'll meet as only strangers, 
In the future, evermore. 
Our once tender love is buried in the past. 
Tho' I've tried to bear the blow, 
Without sighs or bitter tears, 
And tried to smile when my heart ached with pain. 
Yet the burning tears would fall 
In spite of all that I 
could do. 
For the darling one I 
ne'er shall see again. 
CHORUS. 
My dream of love is o'er, 
I 
try to smile when my heart aches with pain, 
But the memory of the past comes up before 
Me, like a 
dream, for the darling one I 
ne'er shall 
see again. 
Oh ! they say you love another, 
Who has claimed you for his bride, 
And you wish me to forgive and to forget, 
All the vows we pledged together 
By the rippling of the tide, 
As 
looked into your beauteous eyes—my Pet. 
Ah! the heart is like the tides 
That flow and ebb at will; 
I 
would not cease to love thee if I 
could. 
So, thro' all the future years, 
ni love the fondly, dearly, darling ! 
For I 
could not cease to love thee if I 
would. 
My dream of love is o'er, &c. 
THE BROOKLYN FIRE. 
Written by Tim MUKRAYS, Ell. and ALICE, and sung by Gist). MURRAY. 
Oh ! sad and dismal is the tale 
I 
will relate to you: 
'Tis of the Brooklyn Fire, and 
The souls that perished, too. 
You all have heard their awful fate, 
The old, the young, and gay; 
That ill-starred band, by Heaven's command, 
Are dead and passed away. 
They left their homes so gay and free, 
With joy on every lip, 
And in their blithest moment, ah, 
There came that fatal slip. 
The demon fire raged around, 
Not one to check its sway; 
All fear and strife once full of life, 
Are dead and passed away. 
But blame to none, it was Heaven's shaft 
That struck that happy throng; 
The king of terrors wakened where 
He slept so deep and long. 
The poor souls in the gallery, who 
Enjoyed that fatal play, 
They little thought their lives were sought— 
They are dead and passed away. 
There are some of those departed ones 
Are well known to you all: 
Harry Murdock and his partner 
Met death within those halls, 
In years to come we'll not forget, 
Though feeble, old, and gray, 
Their souls bereft they would have left, 
They are dead and passed away.

SLAVERY DAYS. 
Words by E. TEARRTGAN. 
Music by DAVE Basattit. 
Music published by Wm. A. POND, N. Y. 
am thinking to-day of dem years dat pass'd away, 
When dey tied me up in bondage long ago; 
In old Virginny State, it was dar we separate, 
And it fill'd my heart with misery and woe. 
Dey took away my boy, he was his mother's joy, 
From a 
baby in de cradle we him raise ; 
Oh, dey put us far apart, an' it broke de old man's heart, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slay'ry days. 
CHonns. 
Dey never come again, let us give our praise to Him, 
Who looks down whar de little children play; 
So ev'ry night and morn, we will pray for dem dat's gone, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slay'ry days. 
Still my mem'ry will steal o'er, to dat dear old cabin floor, 
When de shadow of de sun came peeping in; [bark, 
At night, when all was dark, we would hear de watch-dog 
And we'd listen to de murmur of de wind. 
Jt seem to say to me, " You people must be free," 
For de happy time am coming, Lord be prais'd 
For then we would weep and moan, for our souls were not 
our own, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slay'ry days. 
I 
am very old and feeble, and our life am nearly done, 
I 
have travel'd in the roughest kind of road; 
[18..st, 
Thro' sickness, toil and sorrow, I 
have reach'd de end at 
And I'm resting by de wayside wid my load. 
Forget now and forgive, has always been my guide, 
For dat's what de golden Scripture surely says; 
But our mem'ry will turn roun, when our souls dey were 
tied down, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slay'ry days.

When I'm dead and gone from you, darling, 
When I'm laid away in my grave, 
When my spirit has gone to heaven above, 
To him who my soul will save. 
When you are happy and gay once more, 
Thinking of the days that have been, 
There's one little wish I 
ask of you, 
See that my grave's kept green. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the days will come to you, darling, 
When on earth no more I'll be seen, 
One sweet little wish, darling, grant me, 
See that my grave's kept green. 
Will you keep me, love in remembrance, 
When the voice of chiding is heard, 
When other's may speak in censure or blame, 
Speak not one unkindly word. 
When you are happy and gay once more, 
Thinking of the days that have been, 
There's one little wish I

See that my grave's kept green.

THE LOVER'S TELEGRAPH, 
Words and Music by SAM DEVERE, and sung by him with im-
mense success at the Olympic Theatre, Broadway, N. Y., 
for six consecutive weeks. 
Copyright by SAM DEVERE. 
All rights reserved. 
Dedicated to " Little 
Flossie Robertson," of the Robertson 
House, Boston, Mass. 
When first I 
went to see my gal, 
We courted in the dark; 
But her father and her mother and cross-eyed brother, 
Would listen while we'd spark. 
So I 
bought the new invention, then, 
And gave them all the laugh; 
'Twas a 
string with a 
tin box on each end, 
Called the Lover's Telegraph. 
Oh, the new invention is awful nice, 
I 
know ' twould make you laugh; 
To hear the very funny things we said 
Through the Lover's Telegraph. 
When next I 
went to see my girl, 
I 
had very little to say; 
I 
gave her one end of the new machine, 
And sat about twenty feet away. 
The old folks thought we acted strange, 
And called me a 
great big calf; 
But they didn't know how the old thing worked. 
Through the Lover's Telegraph. 
Oh, the new, etc. 
Said I, " sweet angel dost thou know, 
I 
lovest thee the best?" 
The answer came so soft and sweet— 
" 
Oh, George, pull down your vest!" 
When I 
asked her if she'd fly with me 
To the land of the wild giraffe; 
She answered back " how are you fixed ?" 
Through the Lover's Telegraph. 
Oh, the new, etc. 
Love went flying through the string, 
Till her brother found us out; 
And then he whispered to his dad 
What we had been about. 
The old man gently raised his hoof, 
Nearly splitting me in half; 
He busted a 
hole in my new pants, 
And the Lover's Telegraph.

JUST FROM TENNESSEE, 
Original by JOHNSON AND BRUNO. 
'White folks we are just from Tennessee, 
We left our homes to have some recreation ; 
Greatly delighted we will he, 
If we can only gain your approbation. 
We parted from the old folks with a 
sigh, 
And left them there a-crying on the station; 
But they'll miss us, 'deed they will, 
And the place will be so still, 
Because the boys have left, the old plantation. 
When moon-light streamed across the cabin floor, 
'Twas then the old man sat the banjo ringing; 
The darkies used to gather round the door, 
And massa too would listen to our singing. 
But often now we sigh for our old home, 
For it is the happiest spot in all thelnation 
But we'll go there before we die, 
And now we are going to try 
To show the style down on the old plantation.

ONE day while walking down Broadway 
I 
met my cousin Joe, 
He asked me then if I 
with him 
To the Central Park would go. 
With my consent we then did start, 
And reached the lake at three, 
We took a 
sail, and words of love 
Were pass'd by Joe and me. 
Cino L's. 
Sailing on the lake, 
To the music of the birds, 
The rippling of the waters 
And the sound of loving words. 
(Kepece.) 
On our return we took a 
stroll, 
And soon did reach the mall, 
When from the distance music sweet 
Upon our ears did fall. 
We sat and listened to the band, 
Beneath a 
hawthorn tree, 
While gentle breezes carried words 
Of love from Joe to me. 
Chorus.—Sailing on the lake, Ice. 
Now Joe has asked me to be his, 
Of course I 
won't refuse, 
And Pa has given his consent— 
This chance I 
must not loose. 
And when some day at Central Park

to see, 
I 
know you'll whisper words of love 
Like my dear Joe and me.

CIRCUS SHOW.' 
Isstered according to Act of Congress in the year 1875, by A.J 
Parints, in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington 
The Circus was in town to-day, 
I 
went to see the show, sir; 
Yes, I 
went into a 
tent, 
But it was not for Joe, sir; 
There was animiles great and small, 
Boiling up with rage, sir, 
And a 
feller with a 
barber's pole, 
Stirring them in the cage, sir. 
CHORUS. 
If this ain't true, I 
hope may die, 
I 
want you all to know, sir, 
You can lose your hair and both your eyes, 
At a 
country circus show, sir. 
There was grizzly bears from mountain tops, 
Buffalos from prairies, 
Kangaroos and crocodiles, 
And lots of Irish fairies. 
They had a 
fight into the tent, 
About a 
lot of hash, 
Onion skins and cabbage stalks, 
Broke out with scarlet rash. 
If this Edn't true, Av. 
The elephant sat on his trunk 
Winking at the foxes, 
Kangaroo sat on his tail 
Eating drygoods boxes. 
The lion he commenced to roar 
Like a 
busted Concertina, 
Slam'd the tiger on the floor, 
And eat up the hyena. 
If this ain't true, &s. 
The leopard he began to scratch 
The weasel in the eye, sir; 
The camel he got up his hump, 
And swallow'd up a 
fly, sir; 
The crocodile begin to grunt, 
The bear begin to shake her; 
The buffalo he made a 
jump 
And swallow'd the alligator, 
If this ain't true, t!ii 
The gorilla told the monk he lied, 
Parrots begin to stutter; 
Seven waggon loads of feather bags 
Dump'd into the gutter. 
You ought to see this nigger git, 
Fall on his proboscis, 
Kick'd and fit and scratch'd and bit, 
With the female rhynoroscis.

For the past we've no regret, 
Since the hour when first we met; 
Lay your hand in mine once more, 
Every dream of youth restore! 
Still your words are melody; 
You are always young to me. 
Yes, my love, ere. 
Down the hill of life we stray. 
Soon will came the parting day; 
O'er the river dark and lone 
We shall meet again, my own!

To the brighter, better land;

SPEECH: 
By N EI) H ARRIGAN. 
I 
have been requested by the members of the Academy of 
Design, the Humane Society, and members of the Board of 
Health, to elucidate, to compound, and thoroughly sift the most 
momentuous questions of the hour. 
There has been a 
stereo-
typed impression perambulating and meandering the rounds of 
the backward numbers of the various country newspapers, 
wondering and exciting the populace as to which, what and 
who I 
am; and I 
to-night stand here to uphold the national 
integrity of my individuality. 
Yes, I 
am here to point out to 
you the snags, the bars, the slates against which we are drift-
ing; 
drifting, drift, but whither are we drifting? 
Hold on, 
don't speak, you don't know. I 
am paid for enlightening you, 
and I 
will lighten you of all earthly possessions, such as board 
bills, bank bills and other auxiliaries, too numerous to articulate. 
(Bus.) 
As I 
ponder in my reveries strange fancies, wild hallu-
cinations, night mares and circus horses hold high carnival in 
my brain casket. 
Do not say its drink, for on my honor, as a 
gentleman, I 
defy my most intimate acquaintances to affirm 
that I 
ever refused an opportunity to drink when invited. That 
brings before me the subject of etiquette; and what is etiquette ? 
Simply a 
boarding house, no napkin, no hash, and one tooth-
pick. 
And can you conscientiously ask whither are we drift-
ing ? 
A limited few will remember reading in the Scriptures 
the prodigy of the parable son, where we find the son revolts 
against his pa, the pa against his son; hence the revolution of 
1'176. 
At that time, B. F. C., before the fire in Chicago, corn 
had gone up to 40 cents. 
Erie had fell. 
There was a 
strong 
minded movement going on among the fair sex, in this wise: 
A caravan of camels had crossed the desert of Sarah, and they 
made things lump; they eat all the corn and left the husks. 
hence the husky voice of the speaker. 
But still Jane Maria 
and Victoria Wood-liull the corn ever since. But I 
ask you what. 
did the boy do? He stood on the burning deck—no, burning

sand, and eat raw sandwiches 'T 
was then for the first time 
we heard that bemitiful 1 
alliul," Out in the Cold World, Out 
in the Streets." 
So I 
ask you what was the boy's father when 
he turned him from the door? 
Ile was a 
cannibal, he was 
cruel, he was an iceberg, and Bergh ought to take him for his 
cruelty. 
But we drift. 
I 
would ask you, what is cruelty? 
It 
is a 
solution of drugs taken from the various lunch counters in 
the different parts of the world. 
It is the inhaling tube from 
which children derive their gruel nature. 
The first case of 
brute cruelty was a 
certain Mr. Bailim, who owned a 
mule. 
He 
took him to a 
well to water him, a 
fly alighted on the mule's 
narrative; the mule said shoo fly, the fly didn't shoo; the mule 
kicked, and Mr. Bailim went in the well before he could send 
for Greely to bail him out; hence the antagonistic disposition 
of boys and girls at the present day. 
Oh, yes, my confused 
hearers, when you lay on your couch at night studying Hoyle, 
you are awakened by sweet sounds of music, borne softly, not 
harshly, on the midnight air. 
You spring from your couch, and 
spring into your overalls—no, dollar vardens, from the dollar 
store, out into the sreet, over fence, -housetop, and sty away 
goes the pursued, pursued by the pursuer; but you do not over-
take the enemy. 
They return with 'an army of cats, Thomas's, 
Williams and Mariars. 
Your bootjack, your washstand, your 
bureau, your ammunition is gone; you are a 
prisoner, you can-
not toe the scratch. 
Wherein hangs the claws of cruelty. 
But 
we drift. 
My friends, I 
have here a 
board, not the Board of 
Health, but simply a 
blackboard. (
Bus.) 
If there is any gentle-
men present that would like to transfer their debts from the 
blackboards in the different saloons around town to mine, they 
can do so, without offending the proprietor. (Bus.) 
Now we 
are all aboard. 
This small substance I 
hold in my hand is 
called chalk. 
It is good for the heartburn, and is used princi-
pally by men of mark—Mark Twain, l‘farkquis McCoole. 
It's 
quoted middlings in the market. 
I would also remark that 
chalk is chalk full of alkali, so am I; and its billiard propen-
sities gives it a 
billions apperrance; hence the cue-riosity of it. 
But we drift, (
Bus.) 
Now we strike temperance. (
Bus.) 
It's 
1,7:Tft 
harder than a 
divorce. (Pus one moment) 
The picture that I 
have drawn for you is one of those scenes which we have all 
seen and felt; 
you will observe the giant proportions of the 
subject. 
You will observe the hogshead which has never been 
tapped; you will follow my finger slowly, and we strike the 
guitar or bugle. 
In the spring the roses bloom on the hedge of 
it. 
That is the first sign of the drunkard's doom. 
That is the 
first picture of the series of Temperance. 
Oh, how is it; how 
is it that men will drink. The next picture of the series of Tem-
perance is a 
serious one; one moment. (Bu-s.) 
There's where 
he performs Rummeo in Jolliyet. 
There's where he is in the 
degraded state, New Jersey. 
An outcast, cast out of the back 
door of some saloon, to have boys cast cast iron at him, simply 
because he is shabby genteel, and an old castilion. 
He's never 
had no daddy to push him along in the world, but a 
policeman. 
Where will he be in a 
few moments? 
In a 
felon's cell, on hem-
lock boards, and hem locked up, and he whiskey he was out of 
it; and yet, and yet men will drink. (Bets.) 
Ladies and gen-
tlemen, excuse these tears; yo.0 will prepare yourselves with 
handkerchiefs for the flood, for the last picture of the series is 
a 
thin one. 
Oh, it's too thin, too thin. 
(Bus.) 
One moment. 
There's where he weakens; there's where we drift. 
You will 
observe the only relic his pa and ma could recognize is his 
guitar. 
There's where he is Barnumed, Barnumed and bared 
out, bared down with , grief and Monongahela, he is what is 
called in the dictionary a 
snooze.

A

Most wonderful to relate, 
It grows new teeth in worn out gums, 
Or hair on an old bald pate; 
'Twill take the color from a

Cure a 
woman of too much tongue, 
And impart the bloom of youth to the cheek. 
And sure to make an old maid young.

great discovery sure; 
If you get a 
little sick, you can cure it up quick, 
By trying the Blue Glass cure. 
There never was a 
remedy known in the world 
Like the wonderful Blue Glass cure, 
Cures a 
cough, or a 
cold, or a 
pain in the stomach, 
I'd smile if it did'nt 'em cure; 
A 
wart, or a 
bunion, or a 
cramp in the heel, 
And busted hearts, or sprains, 
And a 
Blue Glass crown in a 
stove-pipe hat, 
Will surely make a 
new set of brains. 
Oh! Blue Glass, &c. 
We've got Blue Glass in our sky-lights, 
It keeps out the wind and the rain, 
We've got Blue Glass all over the house, 
We've got Blue Glass on the brain;

fell in a 
box of old Blue Glass, 
And how it did peel my shins,

CONEY ISLE. 
Written by En. H ARRIGAN. 
Originally sung by BILLY CARTIER. 
At lo German Saratoga, 
Way down at Coney Isle, 
I 
thought I'd go in swimming, 
Just for to see the style 
Of the different kinds of MerMaids, 
And hear them yell and screech, 
While flopping in the water, 
At Coney Island beach. 
There was ladies and babies, 
As happy as could be, 
Dutch tailors and Dutch brewers, 
A swimming in the sea. 
Dry goods clerks in bathing, 
Looking like a 
barber's pole; 
All de Dutch from Mackerelville, 
Like porpoise they did roll; 
The shop girls look like 'maids, 
Floating from the shore, 
Young man newly married, 
Trying to drown his mother-in-law. 
There was drummers and bummers, 
As dirty as could be, 
Taking in their maiden waish, 
A swimming in the sea. 
All the biggest pcliti1::,2,, 
The fattest and. the lean, 
All the water in the ocean 
Could'nt wash them clean. 
Barnum's big fat woman 
Swam our to a 
boat, 
All the buoys in the water 
Would'nt make her float. 
There were Hannahs and Johannahs, 
Maria's and Marie, 
Treading clams, the little lambs, 
While swimming in the sea. 
There was a 
lot of preachers, 
Who came fiorn Brooklyn town, 
Went in to wash their sins away, 
But wickedness wont go down; 
It floated like the garbage, 
And kept within their reach, 
There's a 
good deal from Brooklyn, 
Hangs heavy on the beach. 
There were ladies and babies, 
As happy as can be, 
lilt chowder at Mike Norton's, 
After swimming in the sea.

Fee when the moonlight falls on the streamlet 
Silverile , each ripple with its brilliant rays; 
Out in the midnight making the heart light. 
Waking up the little birds before the break of day. 
Tickling and teasing, kissing and squeezing, 
Telling Iota of little fibs and swearing they are true: 
;Some say it's naughty, others very pleasing. 
Just wait one moment and I'll tell you Nvlbit to do.

Homeward retreating, a 
sad heart beating, 
Because she must bid you the last good night: 
She fondly wishes those stolen kis;ses 
Would last till the morning's broad daylight. 
Out goes the gaslight, then comes the good night, 
Carefully she raises the latch with her key: 
See then the dear miss rushes for the last kiss.

THE BIG AQUARIUM. 
Written, composed and sung by SAM DEVERE. 
Copyright by SAM DEVERE. 
All rights reserved. 
I 
stopped in the big Aquarium, 
Not very long ago; 
To see the bass and suckers, 
And to hear the white whale blow. 
A skate and a 
flounder making love, 
And they shook each other's fins; 
And a 
crab, with a 
sunshade over his head, 
Come along with a 
pair of twins. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the big sea lion he howled and growled, 
And the seal beat time with the drum; 
And the whale he swallowed a 
ton of eels, 
At the big Aquarium. 
I 
had my gal along with me, 
She's purty, but she's dark; 
And when she laughed and opened her mouth, 
thought she'd swallow the shark. 
The lobster smiled and sucked his thumb, 
And laid as still as death; 
When the turtle winked his eye at Sal, 
It nearly took her breath. 
Oh, the big sea lion, 
The music played and the sturgeon danced, 
But the porpoise cleared the track: 
The eel he tied himself in a 
knot, 
And the crab walked on his back. 
The trout and the catfish danced a 
reel, 
And the sea lion let a 
roar; 
When the whale got up and blow'd his nose, 
My gal, Sal, bounced out the door. 
Oh, the big sea lion, etc. 
etc.

George Barnwell, THE M ERCHANT'S CLERK. — ThiS is an 
extremely sensational sketch, but shows Truth stranger than Fiction. 
This deluded victim went from crime to crime with a 
fearful rapidity, 
urged by the baneful influences of women lost to honor. 
He realized 
every moment the evils of his course, but, like a 
bird fluttering over the 
basilisk eye of the serpent, he went down, down, into the vortex of ruin 
and despair. 
This book teaches, in the strongest way, the moral tesson 
of resisting that temptation, which comes arrayed like an " angel of 
light"--beautiful to the eye, and blasting to the soul.. • • Price 25 Cents.
