Nzinga and Folosade Bey work out of their family house in south Philadelphia. They were 
trained by master braider Yvette Smalls and specialize in traditional and modern African 
hairstyling. Their home salon is located in a lower-income neighborhood and there was a lot 
of construction going the day I arrived. I had a hard time getting to their street because so 
many streets were blocked off due to construction. Some blocks felt abandoned while others 
were more populated. The block the Beys live on felt comfortable and welcoming. I arrived 
around 1pm. I walked in and saw a man sitting under a hairdryer with long dreadlocks. Their 
mother was sitting at a desk with a brightly colored red and black striped African dress. The 
walls of the home salon were painted a bright yellow and African artwork was placed 
throughout the space. Folosade greeted me with a big smile and a hug. I started to unpack 
the equipment while Nzinga arrived with her daughters. Shortly after, Folosade and Nzinga’s 
hair models arrived and I photographed them doing hair.  
 
While I was photographing Nzinga and Folosade they explained the hair techniques and 
styling decisions they made. They used things such as feathers, raffia and pipe cleaners to 
adorn the hair and they spoke eloquently about the importance of keeping black hair in its 
natural state. I photographed them doing hair until about 3pm. After the hair models left we 
sat down to do the interview. Their mother and Nzinga’s children were quietly sitting in the 
other room. The interview lasted about an hour and a half. I was very moved by their story 
and they were grateful to be a part of the project. We exchanged hugs and I left around 
4:45pm.
