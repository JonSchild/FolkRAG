Not -on the Map, 
Mr. William Prescott Smith, manager of the Air 
Line between New York and Washington, in a 
speech 
delivered at the recent railroad celebration at St. Louis, 
put to his enthusiastic hearers the followinc, significant 
conundrum : " Where is the Great American Desert 
that I 
read of when a 
boy, and that my schoolmaster 
showed me in the geography?" 
Every man in the 
audience fOrthwith had recourse to his pocket geography 
(railroad men always 
carry a geography in their 
pockets), but not one of them could solve the puzzle. 
Presently a 
voice from the rear of the hall shouted : 
." Put up your books, gentlemen. 
You can't find the 
Great American Desert there. 
It was stolen by the 
land grabbers' during the 
last session of Congress." 
Smith promptly offered the man a 
situation on his 
railroad. 
A Milwaukee paper says that " the story that an 
English capitalist is negotiating ior the purchase of the 
Milwaukee elevator arose from the circumstance of a 
gentleman's dropping ill at a 
restaurant and asking for 
'art' ha dozen holsters.'" 
Why is the earth like a 
school blackboard ? 
Because 
the children of men multiply upon the face of it.

THE HOKEY POKEY JOKE BOOK. 
A Story and a 
Moral.— Charles Augustus Flapdoodlo 
was the son of rich but honest parents, and at a 
very 
early nizo, was born in this city, where, or rather in its 
immedna • vicinity, his career closed a 
short time ago,„ 
This o.treer was, in many respects, a 
remarkable one, 
and presents a 
valuable encouragement to aspiring and 
struggling youth. 
His success in life was due to none of those fortu-
nate circumstances that surround the early days of' 
most of our self-made men. 
His father was no hardy 
pioneer, hewing a 
home out of the Western wilderness; 
on the contrary, he was a 
jolly old sport with plenty of 
money and plenty of time to spend it in. 
Nor was his 
mother a 
plain, frugal housewife, brought up in the 
simple- habits of New England. 
She was one of the 
most dashing belles ever turned out of a fashionable 
boarding- school of the very first class. 
Nor did his 
father die when be was two years old, leaving him to 
support a 
numerous family. 
When the old gentleman 
stepped out, the subject of this memoir- was twenty-
one years old, possessed of much ducats, and his moth-
er married again within the year. 
Neither was he 
obliged to toil early and late to procure a 
bare subsis-
tence, snatching a 
few hours from. sleep to improve his-
mind. 
Nobody ever accused him. of earning an honest,. 
penny in his life. 
No ; as I 
said, none of those advantages that usually 
surround incipient greatness, surrounded him. 
He had 
to make his way in the world unassisted by adventitious 
help. 
Nevertheless, he determined that he would be-
excelled by no one; consequently, not one of.his com-
panions stayed up later, or drank more liquor, or ye-lied 
ou der songs, or spent more money, foolishly, than 
Charles Augustus Flapdoodle, or "-Doodle," as they 
called him. 
He managed to get rid of the money his 
father had left him in a 
shorter space of time than any 
other spendthrift I 
ever knew or heard of; and when 
it was all gone, he got kicked out of more bar-rooms 
in one week than there are in the strongest election 
district in this city. 
f)

His industry was immense. He had worked harder 
than Mr. Greeley ever dared to do, or even think of. 
He cultivated more blossoms on his nose than are con-
tained in all the fields of Chappaqua. 
Ile was accomplished in many arts and sciences. At 
various portions of his career he was a 
repeater, a 
ticket 
speculator, a billiard 
marker, a deputy sheriff, a 
bounty jumper, a 
stool pigeon, and a bummer. 
His 
principal trade, learned in early youth, on which he 
could always rely when others- failed, was that of a 
loafer, and in this he was unexcelled. 
'With all these eminent qualifications, you would sup-
pose that he would have been made an Assistant Al-
derman, at least; and so he might, but, as I 
said, his 
useful career was cut short. 
His friend, Judge Blank, 
for whom he had worked late and early, and voted 
early and often, used his influence to procure him an 
official residence on one of the beautiful islands in the 
East River, opposite anywhere between Twenty-sixth 
and Eighty-sixth street, and there ha succumbed to an 
epidemic that prevailed at the time in that locality, 
called the " jim-jams." 
IIe was buried by an appreciating public. 
His last words were : 
" 
Is my face good for a 
drink ?" 
"No, sir-ee," said the doctor. 
Whereupon he expired. 
MORAL- Put yourself in his place, and never do to-
day what you can put off till to-morrow. 
An exchange gets off the following horrible con : 
" 
-Why is an empty champagne bottle like an orphan?• 
Because it has lost its 
pop.' " 
Doctors talk about paying their visits, when at the 
same time it's their visits that's paying them. 
-Meunier joins Beer, Hoedler, Ai-ago, and other absurd 
astronomers, in asserting that the moon is" a 
dead star." 
This is nonsense : no dead or played-out star would be 
permitted to appear, night after night, or would " at-
tract " as the tide shows the moon does.

THE IIOKEY POKEY JOKE BOOK 
A New Mode of Advertising.— At the funeral of a 
young man in Camden, some time since, the prelimi-
nary services at the dwelling of the parents of the 
deceased were conducted by a 
venerable clergyman. 
After a 
most pathetic and eloquent address, which pro-
voked sobs from everybody in the parlor, the minister 
inquired if there was present " any friend of the de-
ceased who would like to say a 
few words upon this 
solemn occasion ?" 
Before any one could reply, a 
strange man came forward and remarked that, while 
he wished to express the deepest and most heartfelt 
sympathy for the bereaved relatives :Ind friends of the 
corpse, he could not too deeply impress upon their minds 
that the ways of Providence are inscrutable, and that, 
instead of repining at what appeared now to be a 
great 
affliction, it would be more in accordance with the high-
est religious principles to reflect upon the mercies that 
are yet vouchsafed to us. 
In this connection he wishdd 
to call the attention of the company to a 
first rate arti-
cle of Bair Vigor, of which he was the sole agent for 
the State of New Jersey. 
It was warranted purely 
vegetable and to contain no deleterious substance. The 
corpse had used it to great advantage for many years, 
and he would be happy to have the bereaved friends of 
the deceased fall in line and pass around the coffin, so 
as to examine the luxuriant head of hair which the 
corpse had in consequence of using the Vigor. 
Hair 
grown under the influence of the Vigor would last for 
years even in the cold and silent grave. 
ITe would 
especially recommend its use to the undertaker, whose 
head, he was sorry to perceive, was painfully bald. 
Shake the bottle, and rub well in with a 
stiff brush. 
There was sHme other vigor displayed immediately 
after the close of the man's remarks. 
It characterized 
the efforts of the undertaker and fOur mourners, who 
transplanted the Vigor man from the entry to the mid-
dle of the street in a 
sudden manner. 
Virtue in the middle as the man said, when sitting 
between two lawyers.

Stating his Position.—A good story is told of old 
Johnny McGill, who resided during the war in East 
Tennessee. 
Guerillas representing both parties kept it 
so warm in that forsaken region that it was dangerous 
to belong to either side. 
McGill had, in trying to ride 
both horses, got several blackjackin,,
.rs from first the reb's 
and then the Yankees. 
As guerillas dressed alike, he 
made several mistakes in trying to pass for either Union 
or Southern, as he thought would suit the crowd. 
At 
last he was overtaken by a 
party whose politics he 
could not even guess at, and the following dialogue 
ensued : 
" 
Sir, are you a 
Union man?" 
" 
No, sir," replied McGill. 
" 
Are you a 
rebel, then ?" 
" 
No, sir." 
" 
Then what in the devil's name are you ?" roared 
the captain. 
" 
Well, sir," hesitated McGill, " to tell you the honest 
truth, Pm—nothing— and but blasted little of that." 
Mrs. Partington, on reading an account of a 
schooner 
having her jib-boom carried away in 
Long Island 
Sound, one night last week, wondered " why people 
would leave such things out o' doors nights, to be 
stolen, when there were so many buglers about, filter— 
ing everthing they could lay their hands to." 
A 
pompous fellow made a 
very inadequate offer for 
a 
valuable property ; and, calling the next day for an 
answer, inquired of the gentleman if he had entertained 
his proposition. " No," replied the other, " your pro. 
position entertained me." 
An Indiana constable was sent to arrest a 
woman the 
other day. 
She seemed perfectly willing to go to jail, 
but desired the officer to hold the baby while she went 
into an adjoining room to dress. 
The soft hearted offi-
cial has been waiting for the return of his prisoner 
ever since.

Uncle Tim's Iforse.—Uncle Tim listened very pa-
tiently to Ned Hobb's wonderful account of a 
trotting 
; 
horse he owned. 
Ned certainly ow ned a 
good 
animal 
but it was full as certain that he knew how to put the 
matter forward in its best light. 
Ile closed his account 
with a 
detail of the method he followed in feeding his 
horses which were liable to be called upon at any time 
for speed. 
" 
Pootv good !" said Uncle Tim, when Ned had con-
chided ; 
44 but mercy sakes alive ! that ain't nothin' 
compared with an old hoss I 
owned over in Waterford. 
And talkin' about feedite—just let me tell you how I 
fetched that hoss up. 
Ye see, my Cousin Antepast, he 
came home from Californy, and told me how the Injuns 
fed their horses when they ‘vantiod 'em to do great 
things. 
They fed em on raw meat ! 
I'd seen signs of 
big stuff in mv old beast, and thinks I 
to myself, I'll 
just try that. 
And I 
did. 
I 
went down to Major Mil-
let's and engagad ten pounds of fresh beef a 
day. 
I 
don't s'pose the !toss got quite ten a 
day, because there 
was some bone in it—but he got enough, and he eat it, 
too. 
And gewhittaker-to-git! didn't it put the snap 
into him. 
Goodness gracious ! talk about oats! They 
ain't nowhar ! 
I 
tell ye, that ere raw beef just made 
a 
perfect tiger of the animal. 
There wa'n't another 
man in town 'at dared to go near him only me. 
44 Perhaps, gentlemen, you wonder whether that ere 
boss could trot. 
1 tried him on the track Over in Nor-
way ; and then I 
took him down to Lewistown ; but 
t 
make work. The moment he begun to come 
to his speed, away flew the sulky right 
track. 
rw,)iddn't hold on no how ! 
So, ) e 
see, ' tw.a'n't 
use to try to time him! When I 
e' one up from Lewis-
town, Sim Frost come with me. 
Ile was dreadful 
skittish about ridin' behind that hoss, but he was in a 
hurry to get home, so he ventured. 
On the road I 
let 
the old hoss out. 
Jerewsaletn and broomsticks ! 
My 
eyes ! 
I'd never seen him go so afore. 
" Goodness nle r said Sim, what on airth did they 
build such a 
tarnal lil 
Ii hoard lenee 1or ?' 
THE HOKEY POKEY JOKE BOOK.

" I held up sharp and looked on the other side of the 
road; and there, sure enough, I 
saw what Sim took for 
a 
board fence, thirty foot high at least. 
And I 
tell ye, 
gentlemen, if I 
hadn't a 
known just where we was, and 
just what it must be, I 
would have sworn Sim was 
right." 
"Then it wasn't a 
board fence r' suggested Ned 
Hobbs. 
" 
Bless ver soul ! no," answered Uncle Tim, with 
seriousness ; " '
twas telegraph poles !" 
Anecdote of the Road.—A lawyer riding through a 
town, stopped at a 
cottage to inquire his way. 
The 
lady of the house told hint he must keep right straight 
on tor some time, and then turn to the right ; but said 
that she herself was going to pass the road he must 
take, and that if he would wait a 
few minutes she would 
show him the way. " Well," said he, " bad company 
is better than none—make haste." 
After jogging on 
five or six miles, the gentleman asked if he had not 
conic to the road he must take. " Oh, yes," said she, 
`• we passed it two or three miles back— but I 
thought 
that bad company was better than none, so I 
kept you 
along with me." 
It is a 
theological error to suppose that Adam lost 
anything by exchanging the Garden of Eden for the 
whole wide world : he " gained ground " by the opera-
tion. 
Wouldn't Give UP.—A man in New Orleans whose 
sweetheart had married his rival, thought he had hit 
upon an effectual means of supplanting his successful 
competitor. 
Ile went to the justice who had tied the 
nntrimonial noose and endeavored to bribe him to eraso 
the name of the husband and substitute his in its place. 
A short residence in the lock up, followed by an 
appearance before the 
Ilecorder, convinced him that 
this was one of the " tricks that were vain." 
A 
clergyman sprained his ankle the 
other day, and 
so became a

A Boston paper, the Conyregationafist, under the 
head of " a 
double-barrelled shot at folly on the wing,' 
thus pictures a 
young lady of the period . " Now, isn't 
that a 
pretty' looking object ? 
A big hump, three big 
humps, a 
wilderness of crimp and frills, a 
hauling up 
of the dress here and there, an enormous mass of false 
hair or bark piled on the top of her head, surmounted 
by a 
little flat, ornamented with bits of lace, birds' tails, 
Ic:c. 
The shop windows tell us all day long of the pad-
dings, whalebones, and steel springs which occupy most 
of the space within that outside rig." 
The following specimen love-letter was dropped in 
the street by a 
young lady a 
few days ago

Having a 
Perpet Understanding.—A lady, one day 
wishing to order of her German servant ( who did not 
understand English) a 
boiled fowl for dinner, Grettel 
was summoned, and the experiment began. 
It was 
one of the lady's fancies that the less her words resem-
bled her native tongue, the more they must be like 
German. Her first attempt was to tell the maid that she 
wanted a 
cheeking or keeking. 
The maid opened her 
eyes and mouth and shook her head. 
" 
It's to cook," said the mistress, " to cook, to put in 
an iron thing, in a 
pit, pat, pot." 
" 
lsh understand risht," said the girl in Coblentz patois. 
" 
It's a 
ting to eat," said her mistress, " for dinner, 
deener, with sauce, souce, zowose. 
What on earth am 
I 
to do T' exclaimed the lady in despair— but still 
made another attempt : " It's a 
little creature—a 
bird

it's all covered with feathers—fathers— feeders!" 
" 
Ha, ha l" cried the delighted German, at last get-
ting hold of a 
catchword, " ja, ja! fedders—ja, wohl !" 
and away went. Grettel, and in half-an-hour returned, 
triumphantly, with a 
bundle of stationer's quills. 
A good story is told of a New York lawyer, who 
was bothered by the importunities of two unget-rid-
a-ble, lady canvassers for a 
new work. Finally, in order 
to get clear ot them, he said : " Ladies, the partnership 
of Vnich lam s 
member has lately been sov,„
imprudent 
as to ',ssue a new work of its own, which, in conse-
quence of the enormous expense attending its illustra-
tions, entbellishments, etc., has completely crippled us." 
" 
Then. perhaps," replied 
the 
ancrelic canvassers, 
we coull procure .you some subscribers. What do 
you call yoir work r 
" 
wen, me have not fully determined, as yet; 
but 
I 
guess I'll IA my wife have her own way, and call it 
after me—Cturles Henry." 
A 
Sailor win called upon the stand as a 
witness: 
" 
Well, sir, d( you know the plaintiff and defendant!" 
" 
I 
don't know the drift of your words," answered the 
sailor. 
" 
What 
not to know the meaning of plaintiff and 
defendant'? a 
prett fellow you are to come here as a 
witness," said the lawyer. " Can you tell me where 
on board the ship it 
as that this man struck the other 
one?" 
" 
Abaft the binnacle' answered the sailor. 
" 
Abaft the binnacle what do ;you mean by that ?" 
" 
A pretty fellow yoytre," responded the.sailor, " to 
come here as a 
lawye7, and not know what abaft the 
binnacle means!" 
"

tor to a female pa-ticit; " a

a 
neat and pensive retirement lokated on the virgin 
banks of the Hudson, kontaining 85 akers. 
The land 
is luxuriously divided by the hand of natur and art 
into pastur and tillage, into plain and declivity, in a 
stern abruptness and the dalliance of moss-tufted med-
der ; streams of sparkling gladness ( thick with trout) 
dance through the wilderness of buty tow the low 
musik of the grasshopper. 
The evergreen sighs as the 
evening zefer flirts thru its shadowy buzzum. 
Fruits 
of the tropiks in golden buty melt on the bows, and the 
bees go heavy and sweet from the field of garnering 
The manshun is of Parian marble ; the porch is a 
single diamond set in rubies and the mother of pearls ; 
the floor is ox- rose wood, and the ceillin's is more butiful 
than the starry vaults of heavin. 
Hot and cold water 
squirts and bubbles in every direction, and nothing is 
wantin' that a 
poet could pra for or art could portra. 
The stables are worthy of the steeds of Nimrod or the 
studs of Akilles, and its hennery was built expressly 
for the birds of paradise, while sombre in the distance, 
like the cave of a 
hermit, glimpses are caught of the 
dorg house. 
Here poets have cum and warbled their laze; here 
sculptors have sculpt; here painters have robbed the 
scene uv dreary landscapes ; and here the filosofor dis-
covered the study which made him the alketnist of 
natur. 
Next to the northward of this thing of buty sleep 
tin residence and domain of the Duke John Smiths 
while southward, and nearer the spice breathing tropiks, 
may be seen the baronial villy of Earl Brown and 
Duchess Widdy Betsy Jones. 
Walls of primitive 
rock, lade in roman sement, bound the estate, while up-

A story is told of an Irish girl who called on an 
apothecary for some castor-oil, to be mixed with some-
thing which would disguise its taste. 
On being asked 
if she liked soda- water, she replied in the affirmative, 
when the apothecary gave her a 
glass seasoned with 
lemon and the oil. 
But she still lingered waiting, and 
presently asked for the oil again, when the apothecary. 
informed her that she had already taken it. 
"Oh, gracious !" she

Pity the

etc.— Some 
very 
painful 
eases of inhumanity to dumb animals are brought to 
the attention of the women's branch of the Society for 
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. 
Only last Tues-
day, one of the members was standing on a 
doorstep, 
when a 
boy was observed running furiously down the 
street with a 
bull terrier holding with clenched teeth to 
his leg, and refusing to let go. 
Instead of standing 
still and letting the humorous animal quietly loosen 
that in , uthful and walk off with it, the boy was tearing 
along, and swinging the dog from side to side, thump-
ing it against tree-boxes, doorsteps, scrapers, and ash-
barrels, and inflicting painful injuries upon 
it. 
Of 
course the law was instantly invoked, and the ma-
chinery of the society put in motion to insure the pun-
ishment of the scandalous boy, who, we venture to say, 
will die upon the gallows. 
The dog was carried to the 
hospital, where its wounds were dressed, and it was 
wrapped in flannel. 
Thus does the beneficent influence 
of Christian civilization serve to assuage even the griefs 
of helpless brutes! 
" 
Oh, doesn't he disclaim fluidly !" exclaimed Mrs

the flashing beam of his eleoquence broadcast among

'Twas milking time, and the cows came up 
From the meadows s,veut with clover; 
And stood in the lane wi,cre pretty Jane 
Had a 
quiet chat with th e d 
rover. 
Such a 
quiet chat that it scarcely seemed 
That a 
single word was spoken; 
While a 
magic spell with the night dews fell, 
And the rhythm of song was unbroken. 
The cattle stood at the &ever's side, 
Without any show of vexation ; 
As though impressed that a 
five-bar rest, 
\Vas a 
part of their rest-oration ; 
And as Jane listened to the notes that came 
Right under the bars and over; 
Her heart took wing like a 
silly thing, 
And nestled up close to the drover. 
She heard him say th;,t his home was poor, 
That he'd nothing but love to give her ; 
And she smiled content, as though love had spent 
Every arrow he had in his quiver. 
She smiled content, while the evening air 
With the voices of birds was ringing; 
And her lips confessed that a 
lowly nest 
Should never prevent her singing. 
So over the bars the lovers lean, 
In the joy of sweet communion ; 
And their looks declare that poverty ne'er 
Shall be a 
bar to their union. 
Oh, sweetest muse, go thread your rhymes 
Now under the bars and over ; 
Where pretty Jane, in the fragrant lane, 
Bewitched the heart of the drover.

Close Fig uriny .—A Portland, Oregon, hotel-keeper 
was not long since victimized in the following manner : 
A. 13. went to him and engaged board by the week, at 
*10 per week. " Now," slid A. B., " 1 
may be absent 
occasionally, what deduction will Y 
OU make for that?" 
" 
Fifty cents a 
meal and fifty cents a 
lodging," replied 
the landlord. 
Time wore on, and A. B. was some-
times there and sometimes not. 
After a 
while the 
landlord presented a 
bill for three weeks board—* 30. 
In a 
short time A. B. appeared, with a 
counter bill of 
deduction for meals and lodgings missed. 
Meals eaten, 
three, ; lodgings, seven, * 3.50; meals missed, 
sixty, * 30 ; lodgings missed, fourteen, $1 ; balance in 
tivor of A. B., *2. 
The landlord, of course, was a 
little astonished at the result of the reckoning, and, 
therefore, said not a 
word, for the best reason, that he 
could not think of anything that would do justice to 
the subject. 'Whereupon A. B., to relieve the land-
lord's 
perplexity, 
remarked 
with cool 
urbanity : 
" 
Well, never mind the $ 2 ; 
take it out in board." 
The landlord couldn't see how to keep even with such 
a 
boarder, and so the connection between him and A. 
B. as landlord and boarder came to an end.

"My good fellow, your duty is clear. 
Close the

The Young Widow. 
A census- taker, going his 
round, stopped at an 
elegant brick dweling-house, the exact locality of which 
is no business of hours. 
He was received by a 
stiff; well-dressed lady, who 
could well be recognized as a 
widow of some years' 
standing. 
On learning the mission of her visitor, the lady in-
vited him to take a 
seat in the hall. 
Having arranged 
himself in a 
working position, he began his unpleasant 
task by inquiring the number of persons in the lady's 
family. 
" 
Eight, sir," replied the lady, " including myself." 
" 
Very well—your age, madam?" 
"My age, sir," re pli ed the l
ady, with. a 
iziereing,-, 
dignified look. " I 
conceive it's none of your business 
what my age might be; you are very inquisitive, sir." 
The law compels me, madam, to take the age of every 
person in the ward; it's my duty to make the inquiry." 
" 
Well, if the law compels you to ask, I 
presume it 
compels me to answer. 
I am between thirty and 
forty." 
"I presume that means thirty-five?" 
" 
No, sir, it means no such thing—I 
am only thirty 
three years of age." 
"Very well, madam," putting down the figures, 
"just as you say. 
Now for the ages of children, com-
mencing with the youngest, if you please," 
" 
Josephine, my youngest, is ten years of age." 
"

"My oldest and only married daughter, sir) Anna 
Sophia, is a

Twenty-five, did you say ?"

"Yes, sir. 
Is there anything remarkable in her being 
of than age?" 
" 
Well, no, I 
can't say that there is; but is it not re-
markable that you should be her mother when you 
were only eight years of age ?" 
About that time the census-taker was observed run-
ning out of the house, why, we cannot say. It was the 
last time he pressed a 
lady to give her exact age. 
How to Keep Honey.—The way to keep money is to 
earn it tItirly and honestly. 
Money so obtained, is pret-
ty certain to abide with its possessor. 
But money that 
is inherited, or that in any way comes without a 
fair 
and iust equivalent, is almost certain to go as it came. 
The young man who begins by &lying a 
few shillings, 
and thriftily increases his store—every coin being a 
representative of good, solid work, honestly and man-
fully done—stands a 
better chance to spend the last 
half of his life in affluence and comfort, than he who, 
in his haste to become rich, obtains money by dashing 
speculations or the devious means which abound in the 
foggy region lying between fair-dealing and actual fraud. 
Among the wisest and most thrifty men of wealth, the 
current proverb is, " money goes as it comes." 
Let 
the young make note of this, and see that their money

To Let 
Inquire Within. — The lady flounced out in 
a 
rage. 
Two young damsels and a spinster aunt fol-
lowed, and after a 
lengthy inspection of the premises, 
came to a 
state- council in the parlor. 
" 
I 
like the house very much," said the spinster aunt, 
solemnly, " and with a 
few alterations, I 
will engage it 
for my brother's family." 
"Very good, ma'am," said Nahum, rubbing his 
hands and scenting a 
speedy termination of his trials. 
" 
Name ' em." 
" 
The door handles must be all gilded, and I 
should 
like the house newly- papered in velvet and gold, and 
repainted, and the partition between the parlors taken 
down and replaced by an arch, and an extension dining-
room built on behind, and a 
new style of range in the 
kitchen, and a 
dumb waiter put in and new bronze 
chandeliers thoughout, and another furnace in the sub; 
cellar, and—" 
" 
Hold on, ma'am—just ho'd on one minute." said 
Nahum, feebly gasping fu. breath ; " would not you 
like the old house carted away and a 
new one put in its 
place ? 
I 
think it would be rather less trouble than 
to make the trifling alterations you suggest." 
" 
Sir !" said the spinster, loftily. 
" 
I 
don't think we can agree, ma'am." 
" 
Very well— very well--come, 
With prim dignity the lady marshaled her 
charges 
out, 
muttering something about the " extortionate 
ideas of landlords now-a -daYs," while Nahum, ‘vildly 
rumpling his iron-gray hair, soliloquized ; 
" 
Weil, if Job had been alive, and had a 
house to let, 
there n,ver would have been any book of Je written. 
There goes that everlasting bell again !

by the roots, if this thing goes on much lon! ,er.

Another lady, but quite dderent from the other— a 
slender little cast-du' ii lady, with a head that drooped 
like it lily of the valley, and a 
dress of brown silk, that 
had been mended, and t 
urned, and retrimmimed, and even 
Nahum Briggs, bachelor though he was, could see

how shabby it was. 
Yet she was pretty, with big blue 
eyes, and shining brown hair, and cheeks tinged with a 
fair, fleeting color, where the velvety roses of youth 
had once bloomed in vivid carmine. 
And a 
golden_ 
haired little lassie clung to her dress as like as the tiny 
lily buds to a 
blooming chime of flower bells. 
As Nahum Briggs stood looking at her, there came 
back to hint the sunshiny days of youth : a 
field of 
blooming clover crimsoned the June light like waves 
of blood, and a 
blue-eyed girl leaning over the fence 
with her bright hair barred with level sunset gold, and 
he knew he was standing face to face with Barbara Wy-
lie, the girl he had quarreled with years and years ago, 
and whose blue eyes had kept him an old bachelor all 
his life long. 
"This house is to he let, I 
believe?" she asked tim-
idly, with a 
little quiver in her mouth. 
"I believe it is, Barbara 'Wylie." 
She looked up, starting with a 
sudden flush of recog-
nition. 
And then Barbara turned very pale, and began to 
weep, with the little golden-haired girl clinging to her 
skirts, and wailing : 
" 
Mamma, mamma—what's the matter, mamma?" 
" 
Nothing, now," said Barbara, resolutely brushing 
away the tears. 
" 
If volt please, Mr. Briggs, I 
will leok at the house; 
I 
am a w 
ido.v now, and very poor, and . 1 
think of 
keeping a 
boarding-house to earn my daily bread. 
I 
hope the rent is not very hi! ,h?" 
" 
talk about the rent .Ifterward," said Nahum, 
fiercely sw.illowing down a 
big lump in his throat that 
threatened to choke him. 
" 
Come here, little trill, and kis.: me; I 
used to 
know your mamma when she wasn't much bigger than 
you are." 
Barbara, with her blue eves still drooping, went all 
over the house, without finding a word of fault, and 
Nahum Briggs walked at her si,le, and w 
mdering if it

was really- fifteen years since the June sunshine lay so 
brightly on the clover field: 
" 
I 
think the house is beautiful," said meek Barbara. 
" 
Will you rent it to me, Nahum ?" 
" 
Well, yes," said Nahutn, thoughtfully ; " I'll let 
you have my house, if you want it, Barbara." 
" 
With the privilege of keeping a 
few boarders?" 
" 
No, ma'am !" 
Barbara stopped and looked wistfully at him. 
" 
But I 
don't think you understand how very poor I 
am Mr. Briggs." 
" 
Yes, I 
do." 
" 
And that I 
cannot afford to take the house without 
the privilege of taking boarders." 
" 
I 
tell you what, Barbara," said Mr. Briggs, dicta-
" 
give you the privilege of keeping just one 
boarder, and him you have got to keep all your life 
long, if you once take him." 
"I don't think I 
quite understand you, Nahum 
Briggs," said Barbara; but she blushed very becoming, 
and we think that she told a 
naughty little fib. 
" 
What do you say to me for a 
boarder, Barbara ?" 
said the old bachelor, taking both the widow's hands in 
his. " Barbara, we were young fools once, but that is 
no reason why we should be old fools now. 
I 
like you 
just as well as ever I 
did, and 
do my best to be 'a 
good father to your little girl, if you'll be my wife." 
Barbara blushed again and hesitated, but Nahum 
was not to be eluded thus. 
" 
Shall I 
take down the sign 
To let.' Barbara?" 
Yes," she murmured, almost under her breath. 
So Nahum went deliberately out and coolly tore 
down the bill, to the great astonishment and disappoint-
met of a 
party of rapid house- hunters, who were just 
ascending the steps. 
" 
And when shall we be married, Barbara?" he next 
demanded. 
"In 
the summer, perhaps," 
said Mrs. Barbara. 
"To-morrow," said Nahum, decisively, and " to-mor-
row " it was. 
" 
Upon my word, Barbara," said Nahum on the first 
day of :May, as he watched his wife's blooming face 
behind the coffee- urn, " you can't think how much jollier 
it is with you for a 
housekeeper than that hag, Mrs. 
Parley." 
Barbara only laughed, and said " he was a 
dear, good 
old stupid." 
So the probabilities are that Mr. Nahum Briggs nor 
his brown stone house will be in the market again as

Marriage. 
BY JOSH BILLINGS. 
Marriage iz a 
fair transaction on the face of it. 
But there iz quite too often put-up jobs in it. 
It iz an old institushun, older than the pyramids, 
and az phull of pyroglyphics that nobody can parse. 
History holds its tongue who the pair waz who first 
put on the silken harness, and promised tew work kind 
in it, thru thick and thin, up hill and down, and on the 
level, rain or shine, survive or perish, sink or swim, 
drown or flote. 
But whoever they waz, they must have made a 
good 
thing ov it, or so menny ov their posterity would not 
hey harnessed up since and drove out. 
There iz a 
great moral grip to marriage ; it iz the 
mortar that holds the soshul bricks tewgether. 
But there ain't but darn few pholks who put their 
money in matrimony who could sit down and give a 
good written opinvun whi on arth they come tow did it. 
This is a 
grate proof that it iz one ov them natral kind 
ov acksidents that must happen, jist as birds fly out ov 
the nest when they hay feathers enuff without being 
able to tell wh;ch. 
Stun marry for buty, and never diskover their mis-s 
take ; this iz lucky. 
Sum marry for money, and don't see it. 
Sum marry for pedigree, and feel big for six months, 
and then very sensibly cum tew the konelusion that 
pedigree ain't no better than skim milk. 
Sum marry bekawse they hay bin highsted sumwhere 
else ; this iz a 
cross match, a 
bay and a 
sorrel ; pride 
may make it endurable. 
Sum marry for love without a 
cent in their pocket, 
nor a 
friend in the world, nor a 
drop ov pedigree 
This looks desperate, but it iz the strength of the game. 
If marrying for love ain't a 
success, then matrimony 
iz a 
ded beet. 
Sum marry because they think wimmin will be scarce 
next year, and live tow wonder how the crop holds out.

Sum marry tew get rid ov themselves, and discover 
that the game waz one two could play at and neither 
win. 
Sum marry the second time tew get even, and find 
it a 
gambling game— the more they put down the less 
they take up. 
Sum marry tew be happy, and not finding it, wonder 
whore all the happiness goes tow when it dies. 
Sum marry, they can't tell whi, and live, they can't 
tell how. 
Almost everybody gits married, and it iz a 
good 
joke. 
Sum marry in haste, and then sit down and think it 
careful ly over. 
Sum think it over kareful fust, and then set down 
and marry. 
Both ways are right, if they hit the mark. 
Sum marry rakes tew convert them. 
This iz a 
little 
risky, and takes a 
smart missionary tow du it. 
Sum marry coquettes. 
This iz like buying a 
poor 
farm heavily mortgaged, and working the balance ov 
your days tew clear oph the mortgages. 
Married life haz its chances, and this iz just what 
gives it its flavor. 
Every hoddy luvs tew phool with 
the chances bekawse every buddy expeks tew win. 
But 
I 
am authorized tew state that everyboddy don't win. 
But, after all, married life iz full az certain az the 
dry- goods business. 
No man kan swear exaktly where he will fetch up 
when he touches ealiko. 
No man kan tell jist what caliko haz made up its 
mind tew du next. 
Caliko don't know even herself. 
There iz but few who never marry bekawse they 
won't— they all hanker, and most ov them starve with 
bread before them (spread on both sides) jist for the 
lack ov grit.

The Interview. — Touching his hat, he said: " Car-
lotta McBalance, we ask you as a 
woman, and a 
sister, whether your successin that acquatic contest was 
not due to the fact that you spliced the thwart to the 
gunwhale, and then feathered your scull by unrav-
elling the painter and combining it 
in an ingenious 
manner with the ring bolt and conic 
section of the 
binnacle, rather than to the circumstances 
that your 
sheet anchor was held by a 
half hitch around the fut-
tock shrouds while the garboard strakes were flung 
out to the keelsons with a 
N. N. E. inclination to the 
capstan?" 
She said she didn't. 
"Then, Carlotta McBalance," said he, " we have 
found at last in you a 
woman to whom may safely be 
trusted the cause of your sex in our native land and 
the honored star-spangled banner of the free. 
We will 
never desert you; so, come, let us plough through the 
raging mane, come bound through the briny blue;

Oh, then, port your

A Snake Story. 
" 
DURING the late war," said one of a 
party of non-
commissioned officers, " I 
was in the Union army. 
One day I 
shouldered my gun and went in search fir 
game. 
In passing through a 
swamp I 
saw something 
a 
few feet ahead of me lying upon the ground, which had 
the appearance of a 
log, it being some forty feet in 
length and about a 
foot in diameter. 
So positive was 
I 
that it WilS nothing but a 
log that I 
paid no attention 
to it ; the fact is, I 
would have sworn before a 
court 
of justice that it was a 
log and nothing else. 
You see, 
I 
never heard of a 
snake growing to such huge di-
mensions— and the fact is I 
never should have believed 
it if I 
had. 
Well, between me and the log, as I 
took it 
to be, was a 
miry place, which it was .necessary for 
me to avoid. 
I 
therefore placed the butt of my gun 
on the ground before me, and, springing upon it, lit 
right on top of— what do you suppose ?" " A bba-
constrictor," 
said one. " _fro." " What, then, could 
it have been !" asked another. " Just what I 
supposed 
it to have been—a 
log," said the wag. 
Sam B., of Yale, class '55, was somewhat of a 
wag, 
and right lazy withal. 
Labor was as hateful to him as 
holy water is supposed to be to that mythological 
deity dwelling beneath the earth. 
One morning he. 
found a 
barrel of old essays hidden away among the 
rafters of the alumni building. " There," thought he, 
" 
is a 
mine of information ; a 
veritable labor saving 
machine " And acting upon the sugg, ,.stion, he forthwith 
" 
confiscated" an essay, and went home to write it out. 
At the proper time he read it before that genial Profes-
sor of Belles Lettres, Prof. I. 
The probsor listened to 
it attentively to the end. " Pray , Mr. B, for how long

reply. " Well, it took me just three weeks," responded 
the professor. 
Sam had, unknowingly, copied one of 
the old gentleman's prize essays, which, from its success 
at the time, he distinctly remembered. 
Female Strategy.—A lady in a 
church in a 
neighbor-
ing city, where the seats are tree and not upholstered, 
concluded to hav• a 
cushion wade for one of the pews 
for her own its, \ ,Thich she did. 
A few Sundays ago, 
some people 
down town visited the church and 
took possession of the cushioned seat. 
The lady own-
ing the cushioned seat entered the church immedi-
ately 
after, 
and observing her premises 
occupied 
went into the seat next back. 
When the congregation 
arose to sing the lady quietly reached over and re-
moved the cushion, and placed it in the pew she was 
occupying. 
There was once a 
man who was an officer on the 
Erie Canal, and lived at Lockport, became uncomfort-
able in 
the Presbyterian society, and joined a new 
Episcopal church, where he was treated with marked 
attention. 
One Sunday morning, while attending to 
his official duties, he fell into a 
lock, and came near 
drowning, but was at last fished out with a 
boat-hook. 
He asked his rector to be sure to make some allusion to 
his narrow and providential escape in the services of 
the day. 
The poor rector, not wishing to displease his 
new parishioner, searched the Prayer Book in vain for 
something appropriate, and finally, in utter despair, 
read the prayer prescribed, " For a 
Safe Return from 
Sea !" 
They have great trouble with lady school teachers in 
the \Vest. 
The sweet torments begin well enough, but 
in a 
few weeks they are observed to sigh deeply, and 
frequently during the recitations, and then the trustees 
receive a 
letter of resignation. " Going to housekeep-
ing," is the trouble. 
A 
clerk in the Binghamton Post Office heard a

this department is for ducks !"

Although the " flush times" have passed away on the' 
Mississippi, they still have some queer and sometimes 
rough customers on the river boats. 
On a 
recent trip of the Ifighflyer, crowded with pas-
sengers, the clerk had allotted the last state-room, and 
was about to close his office, when he was astonished 
by the apparition of a 
tall Missourian, who exclaimed : 
" 
I 
say, stranger, I 
want one of them chambers." 
" 
Sorry, sir," said the official, blandly, " but our state-
rooms are all taken." 
" 
The d-1 they are," responded Missouri. " I've 
paid my fare, 'n 
I 
want one of them chambers." 
" 
Allow me to see your ticket," said the still polite 
clerk. 
Putting his hand to the back of his neck the pas-
senger pulled out a 
ten-inch bowie-knife, and driving it 
quivering into the counter, said : 
" 
I'm from Pike county, young feller, and thar's my 
ticket. 
I 
want one of them chambers." 
Before the steel had ceased to vibrate the prompt 
clerk quietly thrust a 
loaded and capped six-shooter 
under Pike's nose and coolly answered: 
" 
I've only got 
si
x ' chambers,' and you 
see 
they 
are 
all full." 
The Missourian edged out of range, and putting up 
his tooth- pick, ejaculated, " A 
full hand's good, by — !' 
and strode off to find such quarters as fie could get.

A Good Swim. 
Some years ago the Sea Queen, East India-man, was 
on a 
voiage, when a 
seaman named Thompson fell 
overboard. 
In an instant his comrades were on the 
alert, and, as one means of safety, they scattered hen-
coops and spars on the waves until the ship could be 
brought round or hove to. 
As this operation required some little time, the un-
fortunate man got to windward, and at last by great 
exertion got hold of the rudder, and in this way he kept 
his head above water. 
his messmates in the meantime had been busy 
searching for him on the side from which he fell ; no 
one thought of looking to windward, and as it was im-
possible to hear his cries amid the roar of the waters 
and the whistling of the breeze, his comrades gave him 
up for lost. 
The half-exhausted tar then managed to clamber up 
the rudder, and creeping in by a 
port-hole, to ensconce 
himself in the gun-room: but as the gun- room is below - 
water, his cries, of distress were not heard. 
He, how-
ever, found plenty of grog and biscuit, and with this 
remained very quiet for a 
day and a 
half. 
A 
calm then ensued, and the poor fellow crept cau-
tiously out of his prison house, descended the rudder, 
and went swimming alongside, puffing and blowing, and 
exclaiming as well as his affected breathlessness would 
per : 
" 
Ship-a-hoy ! ship-a-hoy !" 
The seamen could hardly credit their senses. 
" 
Mercy on us !" they exclaimed," that's Jack Thomp-
son himself!" 
" 
Ay, to be sure," replied he, " and a -pretty set of 
lubbers you are to leave a 
poor fellow in such a 
lurch: 
I'm three parts murdered already, starving with hunger, 
and tired to death, and had it not been for this calm I 
should never have come up with you." 
When Jack was brought on board various questiol..: 
were put to him, but he humored the joke and kept the 
secret to himself.

Benjamin Franklin's Horse. 
Prof'. SiMina'', in his autobiography 1..tivcs an amus-
ing account of a 
horse's memory and tenacious adher-
ance to old habits, which introduced Benjamin Franklin 
to a 
very pleasant family : 
M Y 
grandfather had sold a 
swift Narragansette black 
mare which he and the family had often rode to the 
house of his friend, Rev. Mr. Eells, of Stonington. 
This horse came into the possessions of Dr. Franklin, 
who, in one of his journeys to Boston, came uncon-
sciously opposite to the lane leading to the house of 
Mr. Eells; for gentlemen in that day travelled chiefly 
on horseback. 
The horse instantly wheeled towards 
the house, and the rider applied whip and spur and 
voice in vain to force the animal along the public road. 
At length he gave her the rein, and away she flew for 
the house, and was soon at the door. 
The family, seeing a 
strange gentleman ride up, soon 
lined the windows; and the reverend gentleman, com-
ing out, made a 
courteous bow to the traveller, as if 
to bid him welcome. 
He raised his hat in turn, and 
added, " Sir, my name is 
Benjamin Franklin, of 
Philadelphia. 
I 
am travelling to Boston, and my 
horse appears to have some business with you, as he 
has insisted upon coming to your house." 
"0, sir," replied Mr. Eells, that horse has often 
been here before. 
Pray alight and come in and lodge 
with us to-night." 
The invitation so cordially given was as frankly 
accepted, and it resulted in a 
permanent friendship; 
and Dr. Franklin, whenever he travelled that road, 
found here a 
welcome and a 
happy home. 
Ire used 
to remark that he believed he was the only man who 
was ever introduced by his horse. 
Good Reason—A very polite Frenchman applauded 
vehemently at the close of an exceedingly tedious per-
formance by a 
fair, but wretched physician. " Why do 
you applaud ?" asked a by-stander. " Mon Dieu! 
because it is ended !"

Out on the Pacific Railroad, the other day, a 
Kicka-
poo Indian saw a 
locomotive coming down the track 
toward him at the rate of forty miles an hour. 
He 
thought it was an imported breed of buffalo, and he 
was anxious to secure it so as to take the prize at the 
annual exhibition of the Kickapoo Agricultural Society. 
So he fastened one end of his lasso to his waist-belt, 
and when the engine got near enough he threw the 
noose nicely over the smoke-stack. 
Perhaps it is not 
necessary, but we may as well relate that the locomo-
tive did not stop. 
The engineer and fireman witnessed 
the most successful attempt to do the flying trapeze 
made by any Kickapoo Indian upon the plains since 
the first of last January. 
There was an aborg,inal 
funeral at the next station when the train arrived. 
The grave was not large, for they only buried a 
small 
piece of copper-colored meat tied to a 
string and 
inclosed in a 
sardine box. 
A gentleman in Erie contracted a 
vicious habit of 
crawling under a 
circus tent to avoid payment at the 
door; and the proprietor, having discovered his little 
plan, set the elephant on guard. 
The dead-head tried 
it the next night, and in two seconds he was surprised 
to find himself performing aerial evolutions on the 
elephant's trUnk which would have made Van Am-
burg's hair stand on end. 
He came down just in time 
to be kicked by the comic mule with such hearty 
earnestness that he was carried to the hospital on a 
stretcher. 
He says he has a 
taste for genuine humor, 
but that the kind of fun which distinguishes a 
comic 
mule is too sincere to be thoroughly enjoyable. 
Tie is 
now arranging a 
plan for the abolition of the whole 
dead-head system.
