"Dear Mr. President", Austin, Texas, January or February 1942
AFS 6406A
Mrs. John Henry Faulk: I am Mrs. John Henry Faulk at 708 South First Street, Austin, Texas. Dear Mr.
Roosevelt, I am a housewife. I have heard all my life about the millions of dollars that were made
off of the last war. I live in a farm district, and I know that there's no occasion for the rise in the cost
of farm products. You yourself have said that there's enough food in the country to last for some
time to come. I wonder why the government has not put a stop to war profiteering. I am, of course,
wholeheartedly with the defense effort, but it seems to me that profiteering can only be a hindrance
to it.
