BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF T. M. HENGLERi 
Here comes the Almanac of my true date. 
With pleasure. we state, that Mr. T. 
M . 
HEMMEN was 
born at Golden Cross, near the Town of Cashel . County of 
'flpperary, Ireland, in the year of 1845 so, at the pres-
ent time, this gentlemen is in the prime of vigorous man-
hood. 
His home has been in Albany, N Y., since he was 
two years of age; from his earliest childhood, singing and 
dancing came to him as a 
gift of nature; and so marked 
was his abilities in that direction that his acquaintances, 
appreciating his premature development for the stage, fa-
milliarly called him the Merry Little Mnstrel, during his 
schooling days. 
He was always of a 
cheerful and joyous 
disposition, and took great delight in . giving the boys at 
school an imitation of what he had witnessed at the Theft.. 
ire the night p' evious, causing much merriment among his 
playmates. Young in years he entered the profession and 
made extensive tra.v,.I ;ng tours throughout the United 
States, with the most famons and select companies, gain-
ing the praise. front the press both of towns and cities; 
and wherever he appearett, his efforts were crowned with 
such well deserved su , 
eess as to enabl3 him to command 
the highest salary paid to performers in his line 
Ho is, 
indisputably, the originator of the lagitimate style of the 
songs, danres, characters and musical sketches, which he 
por,rays. 
His littst successful novelties are Medley Songs 
and lemees. and a 
new entertainment, entitled The Merry 
Minstrel, in which he represents from five to seven dis-
tinct characters, in rapid succession, losing all identity in 
each representation. 
It affords him sincere gratification 
in presenting this collection of racent• productions, not 
alone as evidence of his originality, but as proof of the 
improvement the minstrel and variety entertainments have 
received, by reason of industry, tact and good taste. 
He 
does not rest content with the creditable reputation he has 
earned, on the contrary the work goes on, in getting up 
new sensations in I, eeping with the times. 
Mr. Hzeceacit 
Is the people's favorite whenever he rimy appear. 
It is his 
study to please, as a 
debt be owes a 
generous public.

THE LAND OF DREAMS. 
As sung by T. 11. H ENGLZEt. 
In the pleasant Summer evening, 
I 
lie beneath the shade, 
Watching the shadows 
That dance on the meadows, 
'When the day begins to fade; 
When a 
sweet remembrance comes to rao 
Like a 
long forgotten strain 
Of music, awaking 
And freshly breaking 
Over my heart again. 
In visions of the past, 
I 
see my love arise, 
And in my dreaming 
I 
feel the beaming 
0( her soft, compassionate eyes; 
Ah I 
Thus may saddened hearts renew 
Their life's pure morning beams; 
On the past to ponder, 
And softly wander,

It's pleasing to a

When first I 
led her to to the dance, 
Her little hand was held in mine; 
How could I 
lose the chance 
To ask if I 
might see her home, 
When e'er she choose to go. 
I 
really thought that I 
would die 
If she should answer no; 
But then she looked so smiling, 
Her pretty little ways beguiling,

I've mixed with the grave and the gay, 
And I've noted the ways of the poor, and the proud, 
As I've journey'd thro' life's rugged way; 
I've seen a 
good man at a 
turn of the wheel, 
By dame fortune to poverty hurl'd, 
And I 
have seen those he fed in his.prosperons days, 
..Pass him by—that's the way of the world. 
Oh yes! it's the way of the world, my boys, 
It's the way of the world, you see; 
Oh yes! it's the way Of the world, my 
boys, 
But it is not the way with me. 
the way of the world to lavish its wealth 
On those who don't need it, we find; 
:To smile at the follies of those that are rich, 
And to their misdoings be hlind; 
.Should poverty err it is quite the reverse, 
The smiles are all changed into frowns; 
Your conduct will always be radged by your purse, 
You will find, in the world's ups and downs. 
Oh yes! it's the way, dce. 
It's the way of. the world to envy the man 
Who by his exertions may rise, 
And cant about hick, if he who have pluck, 
Succeed in the things that he tries; 
Some people make mischief the rule of their lives— 
Beep the banner of discord unfurled— 
Make tools of the weak to gain their own ends, 
As they wriggle their way through the world. 
Oh yes I 
it's the way, &o. 
It's the way of a 
few in the world, I 
observe, 
To frown upon all who are gay; 
And pull a 
long face when innocent mirth 
Would chase the dull moment away; 
I 
have learnt some good lessons by what I 
have seen— 
It is better to laugh than to cry— 
That much good is mixed with the bad in the world, 
And each on himself should rely. 
CHOBUS. 
I've shewn you the ways of the world, my boys„ 
The ways of the world, you see; 
Take the good with the bad, together, my boys, 
That is the way with me.

Sweetly beaming, softly streaming— 
Blue eyes, golden hair;

Brightly gliding, lightly gliding 
Through the mazy dance; 
Half exposing, and half hiding. 
Charms that all entrance.

Sweetest darling Cherry Norine; 
Blue eyed Veauty, sweetly dreaming, 
Golden hair so softly streaming, 
My heart's enchained with love.

Form of fairy, winsome, airy, 
Movements of a-sprite; 
Brighter gem than decks the starry 
Diadem of night; 
Rose tints wreathing, perfume breathing, 
Cheeks and ruby lips; 
Chains of love unconscious weaving, 
Where'er her footstep trips. 
Merry, laughing, (tc. 
What the measure ? Gods would treasure 
Such transcendent bliss; 
Oh! the deep, enchanting pleasure— 
One ecstatic kiss.! 
Still to love her, still to hover 
Near her, and to gaze 
Into orbs whose liquid lustre 
Brightens all one's days.

You'll know where you can find me,

VAN DIEMAYS LAND. 
As Sung by Wm. Muon. 
Come all you lads of learning and rambling boys, bewaie," 
Whenever you go a 
hunting. bring your dogs gun and snare, 
For those lofty hills and valleys we have at our command, ! 
Not thinking of the last farewell going to Van Dieman's 
land. 
There were three men from Galway town, Martin, Luke, 
and James, 
They were three loyal comrades their countrymen they 
formed," 
And it's there they were transported by the keepers of the 
strand, • 
And for seven long years transported, going to Van Die-
man's land. 
We had a 
true-love on board the ship, Jane Murphy was 
her name ; 
And there she was transported for carrying on the game; 
The captain fell in love with her, and married her out of 
hand; 
0, she gave us the best of treatment, going to Van Die-, 
man's land.. 
This land in port we went to, was on riforeign. shore, 
The negroes they surrounded us, about five hundred score; 
They yoked us like horses, and sold us out of hand, 
They yoked us to a 
trace, bravely, to plow on Van Die-
man's land. • 
The houses they built for us, were made of mud and clay, - 
The beds we had to lie upon, was made of rotten hay, 
0, rotten hay for beds, my boys, and slumber if you can; 
Sure, they gave us the worst of treatment, all in Van Die-
man's land. 
One night. as I 
lay down to sleep, I 
had a 
pleasant dream,' 
I 
dream'd that I 
was in old Ireland, down by a 
purling 
stream ; 
I 
dream'd I 
was in old Ireland, my true-love at my corn- 1 
mend • 
But when I 
awoke ,my heart was broke, all in Van Die- 1 
man's land.

And be my heart's own Queen.

Oh, had you seen the look- she gave, 
As bright as blooming flowers in May,

Just at the close of day.

PRETTY AS _PICTITRE. 
As sang by MACKIN & WILSON. 
OH 1 
my heart is gone, and I'm forlorn, 
A 
darling face has won me, 
Such a 
lovely girl, with teeth of pearl, 
I 
met down by the brook, 
She is the prettiest, and the wittiest, 
her smile has quite undone me, 
I'm her only beau, she told me so, 
When first my arm she took, 
She's as pretty as a 
picture, 
And her voice is just the cage, where the little birds MO 
singing, • 
She's the sweetest, and the neatest, 
She's as pretty as a 
picture all the while. 
Oh, my heart is gone, and I'm forlorn, 
her darling fate nas. won me, 
Such a 
lovely girl, with teeth of pear' 
An angel without wings. 
When 'twas time to go, we talked so slog. 
The roses scarce could heat: us, 
Then my heart in sport, ' twas,ctipid's ca/kg 
Like fishes near the shore, 
When I 
loved her so, as I 
turned to go. 
She fondly lingered near me, 
And she dropped her head, and sweetly said, 
I 
wish you an-revoir, 
She's as pretty EtS a 
picture, , 
And my heart is a 
golden frame, whenever you may Ea& 
her, 
She's a 
fairy blithe and airy, 
She's as pretty as a 
picture all the while:\ 
Oh, my heart, &a.

Pull Pawn the Bii4" 
Dedicated to TONY PANTOR, by HAN.RI U. RICHMOND. 
Flash sayings, you know; nowadays are the rage— 
'They're heard in the parlorthe streeV-z-on the stage— 
"You're too fresh," and " swim "ont YOU: ore over your 
head;" 
But a 
new one's been coined, and the old ones are dead. 
" 
A 
Centennial crank" to one that is new, 
And" crawl out of that hat" is quite recent, too; 
But the latest flash saying with which we are blest 
Is to tell a 
man quietly " Pull down your vest." 
CHORUS. 
Pull down your vest, pull down your vest,' 
'Tis a 
singular phrase—a 
peculiar request— 
" 
Shoot the hat" is " played out," " frish soap's" 
got a " rest," 
And the whole k city's cranky on 1' 
pull down your 
vest." ,• 
The other day a 
yoting man borrowed money of me— - 
I 
thought he was holiest,' but got fooled, you see; 
I went to the trouble to borrow the money 
Which I 
lent to this student, who acted so fanny ; 
He told me he'd pay me the very next night, 
But I 
met him the next morning—he was awfully tight— 
"You've treated me meanly, it must be confessed; 
Where's my money ?'• His answer was ?rill down you:

PULL DOTN YOT,Jj(VEk'. 
By Brux MORT/AND. 
Did you ever hang out in a 
liquor. saloon ? 
I 
own that I 
did—I'm a 
foolish gossoon-4. 
Though I 
knew it not then, I-found it out soon, 
For a 
party I 
met there by night and by day. 
. . 
Whenever into that saloon I 
would go,' - 
I 
would meet with that crowd, that did dead me on so, 
They'd stand and they'd drink 'till the daylight would glow, 
F 
And whenever I 
entered the 'place they would say: 
• CHOW:M. 
" 
Pull down your vest: say, pull down your vest--
Sling up your hat, now, the same as the rest; 
We always have thought you as good as the best. 
So don't you go shy now, but pull down your vest." 
This "Pull down your vest," I 
did soon understand, 
Was a 
modest request to treat all on hand, 
Which I 
foolishly did, and thought it so grand, 
That L 
joined in, and soon became one of the crow; 
And then with the rescat the bar I 
would drink, 
And smoke bad cigars 'till I 
scarcely could think; 
And if any one entered, at each other we'd wink, 
- 
Then we all would yell at him noisy and loud— 
Pull down your vest, &e.

GOLDEN HAIR. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
'Sung by T. M. HEN.GLES. 
As I 
strolled out one evening, 
The sun had just gone down 
While pleasantly meandering 
A 
little way from town, 
I 
there beheld a 
damsel 
With eyes the brightest blue 
Beneath her dark eyelashes, 
Like violets dipped in dew. 
CHORUS. 
She smiled so sweet upon me, (symph.) 
That moment she had won me, 
'Twits love the first I 
knew. , 
There, some sweet charm entrancing, 
With this dear girl so fair, 
A 
rosy, soft expression, 
With a 
mass of Golden 'Hair. 
Now, I 
followed on behind her, 
I 
think she knew it well, 
And as a 
sweet reminder, 
Her handkerchief it fell; 
I 
raised the scented linen 
From off the grassy ground; 
Her name, in letters crimson, 
On one corner then I 
found.

ata what two leading New York Papers say of it. 
The New 
;York Zvening Nail writes: 
- A 
little book has lately appeared in print at Messrs. Fisher & 
Denison's, 98 Nassau street, called ,"The Little Flirt.". We 
cannot 
sty that we recommeV It to our young lady and gentlemen readers, 
el we think it would only encourage the bad br bit of "flirting.", 
Unfortunately there is enough of it done without any further neees-
uity of explaining "how, when and where to do it 
and this little , 
volume would advise and initiate the uncorrupted in practising what 
is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: 
We 
have lately seen a 
neat little book, bound in Mortise°, costing • 
25 apt., called "The Little Flirt," published by Messrs. Fisher & 
Denisont 
91iNassau street. 
It gives information of the modus Oper-
andi of fiirtrng, and of the meaning of every motion of the hand-
kerchiekfan, glove and parasol. As there is nothing at all objec-
tionable in the volume, and its contents might afford some innocent , 
amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recommend it to our ' 
young lady and gentlemen readers.

The LITTLE FLIRT contains Fourteen Silhouette Muse-
trations. 
Is bound -with bevelled edges and gilt sides,

First Book for Mechanics, MachiniSta FI 
By OLIVER BYRNE.

ENDORSEMENTS OF THE PF 
The highest praise which can' be given t• 
elementary work on practical mechanics, c-
lowing simple statement of facts: The edir, 
while teaching natural philosophy an - 
Cooper Institute from 1859 to 1864, 
book of practical mechanics, adapted-
who had been trained in mathematk 
the many mechanical text-books, there wise uot one whier 
fully answered his requirements as the 'above work. 
It 
therefore adopted and used with perfect satisfaction, and 
is with pleasure that he receives it now as an old friend fr& 
the publishers, gives it his most earnest recommendatioi 
and wishes it in the hands of all who are still in the fog aboj. 
the units of work, calculation of the power of machineA• 
resistance to motion; strain on material, eto.—Manufacturl: 
and Builder, July, 1874. - 
e 
Jhe author of this *work is well known as an . extensive 
writer who has made some valuable additions to Atherican 
technical literature, enumerated above in detail. 
The work 
we are now , noticing is a 
theoretical treatise on practical me: • 
chanics; -deaigned to supply a 
recognized deficiency. 
Most 
of the works on mechanics treat the subject in a 
manner 
which is not available to young men commencing as appren-
tices in shops. 
Any young man with a 
fair knowledge of 
arithmetic may, however, use this work to great advantage; 
it is not , 
only suitable for a 
text-book, but also as , a,.,work 
of reference. 
Most ambitious young men Will Make them-
selves so familiar with its contents as to be hble to refer 
readily to any portion of the book. The author has aclopted 
a 
new notation to distinguish units of work from other units, 
which is not without value, and might be advantageously 
introduced into more ambitious works. 
The , 
book - is Well 
printed on good white paper, and bound in stiff cloth covers.
