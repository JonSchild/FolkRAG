Nickerson:  All right. So, this is Virginia Nickerson. And I am interviewing, are you still Cassandra 
Hemenway? [Hemenway had gotten married the previous weekend]. 
Hemenway:   I am. 
Nickerson:  At the Additional Recyclables Collections Center in Berlin? 
Hemenway:  Barre. 
Nickerson:  In Barre, Vermont. On September 11, 2018. So Cassandra, could you tell me roughly when 
and where you were born? 
Hemenway:  Sure. I was born oh my gosh, my mind just went blank. I’m sorry. I was born 
1968 in Northampton, Mass.
00:44 
Nickerson:  All right. And could you tell me what your current job is, and how long you’ve been in this 
line of work? 
Hemenway:  Sure. My current job title is outreach manager at the Central Vermont Solid Waste 
Management District, which just so there’s no confusion, is the entity that operates the ARCC, the 
Additional Recyclables Collections Center. And I’ve been in this line of work about six and a half years. 
01:09

Nickerson:  And what was your pathway to be in solid waste? And what kind of work had you been doing 
before? 
 
Hemenway:  Well, to be totally frank, I used to refer to myself as the shit manager at my house. I was a 
stay at home mom for about 15 years before I got the job at the district. I had three kids, chickens, pigs, 
cows, a husband, and basically dealt with the shit for all of them. So I had solid waste management 
experience long before I came to the district. (laughs) I mean, every chicken, every pig, every baby, every 
adult. But that said, my experience was not directly in solid waste management at all. The reason the job 
attracted me was actually because I had as a child growing up, my dad was an environmentalist, a 
permaculture design teacher. We grew up in a household where words like “humanure” was common 
when nobody else had heard of them. Nothing was wasted. Everything was reused. So that was kind of 
like how I grew up.  
 
 
And then I went on, I actually ended up getting a master’s degree in print journalism and was a 
reporter for a few years and a freelance writer. All those years that I stayed home with my kids, I kept 
freelance writing. But I did not expect to be in solid waste management. It was just something that was 
kind of part of my life. We were, because I was a stay at home parent, we only had one income, and it 
wasn’t a very big one. So I learned how to get things used, reused, and how to return them back into the 
cycle. I got really good at it. People used to come to me and ask me where to bring things, just like they 
do now at my job. Like, where do I bring whatever? Clothes. What do I do with a refrigerator? What’s the 
place to go for whatever? I mean, I just knew all those things, because I was tapping into all of them. 
 
So when I saw, when I was ready to go back into the workforce and I saw the job application for 
someone who would be the staff writer at the district, be involved in educating about recycling, 
composting and reuse, which are my passions already, I felt really drawn to it. And I was really thrilled 
that I got it.  
 
And then it’s been really, I don't know what the right word is. I was going to say my vocation or 
career isn’t really the right word because you know, who knows what happens with careers. But it’s 
definitely been...it’s worked out. Let’s just put it that way. (laughs) It’s worked out pretty well. Yeah.  
 
03:55 
 
Nickerson:  I know you just listed, sort of as an overview, some of the things that you do in your job. But 
could you describe your job? 
 
Hemenway:  Sure. And the job has really evolved. It turned out, I found out after I got it that they had 
actually created, it was a new job. They’d never had anybody in it before. So it was kind of lucky, 
because I got to invent what the job was, basically. And I had a supervisor who was fairly hands off. You 
know, there was some guidance. So in the beginning it really was running the website, sending out 
emails, answering questions about recycling and composting. You know, just, and we’re a zero waste 
organization. At the time, zero waste principles were written into our solid waste implementation plan. So 
I had a lot of emphasis on educating people about what zero waste meant.  
But over time, the Act 148, the state’s universal recycling law that bans—here I am in my mode 
of educating about Act 148—but the act ban’s recyclables and compostables [from going into landfills], 
that was just passed when I started this job, and the implementation started after I’d been in the job for 
3 
 
two years. And that changed everything about how I had to do the job. Suddenly there are some really 
clear, specific state mandates about what had to be done around educating people. And I was the person at 
the district. So everything about my job switched gears. And it was about educating people about the 
different phases of the law that were getting implemented, starting with getting the largest generators 
composting, or diverting food scraps. And the focus of my job became recruiting businesses to come on 
board to our organics hauling. So I was kind of in sales, basically, which frankly I hated. I’m terrible at 
direct sales. Really good at like the kind of outreach, the shotgun approach of putting out information on 
multiple different platforms and having people absorb it without even realizing where they heard it. Not 
so good at going directly to somebody and selling them something.  
Honestly, partly because I really hated that (laughs), which I probably shouldn’t say, but I figured 
out that the way out of that was to apply for grants and try to get grant funding for stuff that I really 
wanted to do. And I did get a nice USDA grant. And it allowed me to hire an assistant who got a 
promotion immediately and became our business outreach person. Excellent at it. So I got that off my 
plate and I got to focus on doing the stuff I loved, which was the advertising campaigns and putting out 
messaging around recycling. We went around, did presentations. We developed like fun family nights at 
schools. It was all about recycling education and composting education. And we had such a big turnout 
for that stuff. You know, the job has evolved since then. I got more grant funding. So we’ve been 
focusing on compost workshops and just getting more and more in the community, hands-on, hands in the 
dirt. You know, setting up community composting sites around the district. So people around community 
gardens or housing projects have an on-site compost system where like sometimes up to 25, 32 families, 
in some places, are all contributing to one system.  
It’s been really exciting. I’ve been like falling in love with the job more and more. But as long as 
I get to create it. (laughs) And you know, like the composting thing has really been exciting to me. 
Because the state, you know, the focus has been on businesses. And that’s all about getting food scraps 
into totes, getting totes into trucks, hauling those off to a facility where they, in our area, food scraps that 
get hauled from businesses go to one of two, either Grow Compost or Vermont Compost. They get fed to 
chickens. They get turned to soil. I love that, except I hate it—I don’t hate it, but I hate that there’s so 
much trucking involved in that. And it makes sense for large-scale. They’re not going to be doing a 
compost system in the back of Shaw’s.  
08:21 
 
So I kind of got interested in the smaller scale, help the residences. Because you know, 
recognizing that over, when I started doing this a few years ago, I had about three or four years to get as 
many people educated on how to compost in their backyard as possible, because it seemed absolutely silly 
to me to put your food scraps—I’m totally digressing, aren’t I? 
 
Nickerson:  No, no, no, no. 
 
Hemenway:  I just started—okay. 
 
08:49 
 
Nickerson:  What you are doing is absolutely great. Maybe if you could just very briefly explain what Act 
148 is? 
 
4 
 
Hemenway:  Oh, okay. (laughs) Sorry. I went off. Like you can see I love this stuff. You asked one 
question, I was like, blah, blah, blah. 
 
Nickerson:  That is perfect. 
 
Hemenway:  Okay. Act 148 is legislation passed in 2012. It became informally known as the Universal 
Recycling Law. And it just absolutely changes the way solid waste is handled in Vermont. And it’s also 
cutting edge legislation, because nobody else in the country was doing it at a statewide level until 
Vermont passed that law. So the pieces of it that people pay the most attention to are mandated recycling, 
which was implemented in 2015. So a certain number of recyclable materials are banned from the landfill 
now. And mandated food scrap diversion, meaning food scraps not allowed in the landfill. People like to 
call it the composting law. They think that composting is mandated. But all that’s mandated is that food 
scraps stay out of the trash. And then, you know, there’s different ways that happens. Mostly it’s 
composting. Sometimes it’s animals. Composting on site. Actually, there’s not a lot of options. (laughs)  
 
We have some that goes to the anaerobic digester. And there are renderers, who will take bones. 
But mainly—so the law doesn’t say anyone’s required to compost. It just says they’re required to keep it 
out of the trash. And then there’s a number of other materials banned.  
But it was, I was pretty excited to be part of this thing that was the first in the country. I mean, 
yes there were cities and municipalities. Believe it or not, I don't know if you knew this, there’s, the army 
set up, I believe it was five zero waste bases across the country. And they were composting, recycling, of 
course. And all other kinds of measures to reduce their waste and try to get their waste down to zero. This 
was years ago. I don't know if it’s still ongoing. But the reports I read was that they were saving money, 
and putting that money back into grants that were going toward expenses for vets. I hope that was true. I 
hope I wasn’t reading something by someone who was spinning it. So we weren't the first to think of it. 
And of course it’s happening all over Europe. But it just felt like really exciting to be part of this. 
11:22 
 
And then, of course, I learned that my job, really, I mean, you asked what my job is. My job is to 
get people to change the way that they do things. That is really hard. I mean, to get someone who just like 
doesn’t want to think about what happens the minute they drop something in a bin, to think about it. It 
seems simple. And when I started it, I thought oh, this is simple. Recycling is easy. You just throw this 
thing into this bin instead of that bin. It’s the same motion. It’s the same physical motion. But it meant 
that people had to think about it. And so what you’re really trying to do is interrupt a brain process. 
 
I’ve been to so many conferences and so many places where you know we learn from each other 
and learn how to do this. But nobody has ever talked at any of these conferences about really how do you 
change a behavior in somebody’s mind. You have to change, you have to interrupt something that’s 
happening in somebody’s brain. And I haven’t, I think that I’d have to go to a psychology conference to 
learn that. I would love to learn it and teach it, if I could just learn it. (laughs) Because there’s a—do you 
mind if I blabber for a second? 
 
12:37 
 
Nickerson:  This is great. 
 
5 
 
Hemenway:  Okay. So our district, my employer is named the Central Vermont Solid Waste Management 
District. Try saying that five times fast, right? It’s a terrible name. And all of the districts have equally 
terrible names. So we don’t get people really remembering us very well. And then just to add insult to 
injury, a lot of people think we’re Casella [ a local large commercial solid waste management company 
and hauler]. And Casella is doing good things, but they are a for-profit company. They really don’t care 
about the stuff that we do. We’re about reducing waste, keeping stuff out of the trash, you know, reusing. 
And ultimately, we don’t really do a lot of this because we’re taxpayer-funded and it’s touchy, but [it is] 
ultimately about reducing consumerism in general, because that’s how you reduce waste. So we really 
balk when people call us up and inform us that we’re Casella. 
 
13:30 
[End Track 1. Begin Track 2.] 
 
00:00:00 
 
Hemenway:  So, it’s understandable people don’t remember who we are. So this one moment happened 
where I called up some business or another for something. And I have this mouthful to say. “Hello, this is 
Cassandra from the Central Vermont Solid Waste Management District. Can I talk to so and so?” And so 
I’ll say this spiel—the whole name, all five words of it—and then the person on the other end says, “Joe! 
It’s Cassandra from Casella!” And it’s like, what?! I just said, Central Vermont Solid Waste—but I 
realized, okay, there’s something in their head. This happens. This is a thing with brains. Once you have 
an idea there, it’s there. And we’re seeing this in politics now. I mean, we see it all the time. But the idea 
is there. In this case, it’s kind of a minor one, not a big deal thing. They’ve decided we’re Casella. And 
you can stand in front of them and say, “No, this is the Central Vermont Solid Waste Management 
District.” And they’ll say, “Oh, Casella, yeah.” It’s like this thing that’s happened in their brain. And 
that’s the same thing, I mean, that’s applicable everywhere. So that’s the thing. That unmovable, hard 
idea that we have to break. Not necessarily about the name, but about like “once I throw this in the trash 
bin, it’s gone forever. And I never see it again. It has nothing to do with me ever again.” When that’s 
obviously not the case.  
And that happens with flushing the toilet. I mean, we have this sign in front of the toilet at our 
office that came from the city. And it says, “Please do not flush.” If you own property in Montpelier, you 
would have got it in your water bill. And then there’s a list, a two-column list, I think there’s at least two 
dozen things on the list. Everything from hypodermic needles to Swiffer’s, to wipes, to makeup, to you 
know, diapers. Obviously feminine products. Like all the stuff. And you know they got that list because 
there are human beings at the sewer plant who had to pick out dirty diapers and hypodermic needles and 
all this gross stuff that people just flush down the toilet. Because once you flush it, it’s gone forever and it 
disappears. Goes into a black hole and you never have to think about it again. 
So my job, I just gave you like the super long answer. My job is getting in between that like 
circuit in people’s brains to something that they think they already know and don’t want to think about, 
and somehow get in there and change their thinking about it, which I don't know how to do still. (laughs)   
 
02:37 
 
Nickerson:  Yeah, I was going to ask you if you have stories of different ways that you’ve been trying to 
do that. Or if you had stories about "ah ha" moments. 
6 
 
 
Hemenway:  Yeah. (sighs) That’s a good question. Well, I think, you know, just for context, the way that 
we get information out ranges from posting on our website and social media and sending out emails and 
all the digital platforms, ranges from that to messages in newspaper articles, you know, advertisements. 
All our ads are really designed as a message about our mission. And then it’s going to events and talking 
to people one-on-one. And then sometimes it’s really like holding collection events. 
 
A collection event always has many layers, what we’re doing with it. So I’m not in the operations 
part of the district. I don’t organize the hazardous waste or whatever. But I show up at the events, or 
someone from the outreach team does. And we hand out information and we talk to people. And to me 
that’s where, when we have a collection event, that’s where we have the most impact. Because we 
individually talk to each person in each car. And usually, there’s usually people who— 
 
03:58 
 
Nickerson:  And that’s collecting household hazardous waste. 
 
Hemenway:  Or we have many, so that’s one kind of event, yes. But there’s this one event we hold here at 
the ARC. We started—this is funny, actually—we started collecting e-waste, electronic waste, here at the 
ARC once a year. Even though electronic waste is one of the state’s extended producer responsibility 
laws. Like it’s collected by, the manufacturers pay for it, there are sites all over the state where you can 
drop it off for free. It’s collected year-round in, I think it’s at least a hundred locations around the state. 
We collect it at the ARC year-round. Even though all of that is true, we still see TVs by the side of the 
road all the time.  
So we decided that our way of celebrating America Recycles Day was going to be to have this 
outreach event that we would pretend was an e-waste collection. But really, our goal was outreach. So we 
would advertise the heck out of it. And we were collecting TVs and computers. We’d do it right here in 
this building. We’d get a bunch of staff onboard. We’d have fun with it. And what’s happened is, all the 
people who don’t usually come to our stuff, who obviously aren’t paying attention to what’s happening 
with solid waste, because if they were, they’d know they can drop off their computer anywhere, anytime 
for free, not anywhere, but, you know, there’s a lot of places that take it. So we get people who don’t 
usually come. And they bring sometimes truckloads of like computers from the ‘80s that have been sitting 
in a shed or whatever. And then we get to have a conversation face to face. And they might say things that 
are completely off the wall and have no bearing on what’s in reality around how their waste is managed. 
And we get an opportunity to talk to them about it. They’re here physically at our building, so somehow 
we’ve managed to lure them in. And they can stop and check it out if they want to. They get a brochure, 
so they can see. 
So we’re hitting them with first of all, a service, we’re taking their stuff for free. Second of all, 
face to face conversation. Usually with two of us. Because we have one person who’s working the line of 
cars and handing out stuff, and another person who’s kind of like getting the car situated. So there’s at 
least two human beings. There’s always questions. Every single person has questions about something 
else unrelated to what we’re collecting. So I think—we’ve got face to face, we hand them brochures, 
they’re at the facility. Sometimes they’ll get out and walk in. I can’t tell you exactly like percentage-wise, 
how many people come back. But I think that’s the most effective way. It’s super labor-intensive. It takes 
a lot of time. But that’s where we’re actually reaching people who aren’t already tuned in. And, you 
know, so for everything we do, all the fun, creative radio ads and paper ads and articles, and we develop 
7 
 
booklets. And that’s all effective and that all works. But if our goal is to reach people who aren’t hearing 
the message, we’ve got to collect something that they want to get rid of. (laughs) It’s really basic. 
But then we have to be smart about it once they get here, and make sure that we’re really talking. 
And not everyone wants to talk. If they don’t want to talk, we don’t [let them?]. Some people think that 
they’re only allowed here, and we’ve done this before, they’re only allowed if they’re from within our 
district. So we’ll see them like lying. (laughs) It’s so obvious, you know. We collect information about 
what towns people are from, because we like to know how many people in our district we’re serving. But 
there are people who will sort of stammer and stutter and pretend they’re from Montpelier. You know, we 
just pretend that we agree with them, let them through. (laughs)  
 
07:42 
 
Nickerson:  Can people from outside the district bring things here? 
 
Hemenway:  Yes. We didn’t used to allow that. But we do. Now we have a fee structure in place. And so 
we do take, we take material from anybody who brings it. 
 
07:53 
 
Nickerson:  And I think that you said that you also, that you do composting workshops yourself? 
 
Hemenway:  Yeah, yep, I do. 
 
Nickerson:  Could you tell me about that? 
 
Hemenway:  Yeah. So I started teaching composting workshops. And it kind of evolved through the grant 
work. But it kind of started a few years ago in anticipation that food scraps were going to be banned from 
the landfill by 2020 for everyone. So I was like, for me, before I was doing all this, any of this stuff was 
really about like how am I going to save money? And I composted because it was cheaper to compost 
than to put trash, put garbage in the trash. 
 
08:33 
 
Nickerson:  So you were saying, how am I going to save money as a mom? 
 
Hemenway:  Yeah. As a resident. As a person with a household living with a low income. And if I’m just 
thinking—now I compost, it’s second nature. But if I were someone who hadn’t done it before and I 
found out that food scraps were banned, and I’ve got to figure this out, the cheapest way is to do it in your 
backyard. It’s by far, there’s no other less expensive way to handle that material. Unless you also have 
chickens or whatever. So I started doing it for that reason. And started educating myself more. And I 
8 
 
discovered that there’s a big difference between people who educate about composting for solid waste 
management reasons, and people who are into composting because they’re really all about soil.  
 
So I discovered I’m a solid waste management composter. And I love soil, and I love gardening, 
and I have great respect for composters who are making really, really replenishing soil and doing amazing 
things like Karl Hammer [owner operator of Vermont Compost, one of the first commercial compost 
companies in Vermont]. But in my backyard, I’m happy with whatever comes out of my compost bin – it 
still makes my garden better. And I don’t sweat it if it’s not going to be like perfect. 
 
So that’s how I teach. I teach people a very, very simple way to put their food scraps in a bin, 
make sure they’re adding enough carbon so that they’re not going to attract animals, and put it on your 
lawn, put it on your garden when it’s done. That’s like the two-second version. There’s more to it, 
obviously.  
 
But I started going to more and more trainings. The more I was teaching it, the more I wanted 
to—I did the master composter thing. I did a two-day like facilities management training. This was for 
people who were operating like full-on composting facilities. And I learned there’s actually snobbery and 
elitism in the composting world. (laughs) Like there is— 
 
10:26 
 
Nickerson:  Tell me about that. 
 
Hemenway:  Oh my God, I was so pissed off. What’s her name, Athena Lee Bradley, who works with, I 
can’t remember if it’s NERC [Northeast Recycling Council] or NRRA [ Northeast Resource Recovery 
Association], but she facilitated this workshop along with the local district in New Hampshire that held it. 
Athena is a firecracker. So the guy who taught it was amazing. He runs the Maine school of composting. 
And usually that’s like a weeklong program, and he condensed it into two days for this workshop. And I 
learned a lot. And I brought a lot of what I learned from him into my workshops. But towards the end of 
the workshop, he made a comment that oh, people who compost in those black boxes—he was referring 
to like soil saver compost bins that we sell and promote—shouldn’t bother at all. They’re not really 
composting. They’d be much better off dropping off their materials where someone else can handle, 
someone who knows what they’re doing, someone, he meant, like him. Someone who knows what they’re 
doing. But it’s food scraps - they disappear when you throw them in the ground- I mean, really! So he’s 
teaching this whole roomful of people that “oh, those people with those black boxes don’t know what 
they’re doing.” 
 
And I got really ticked off. And I was kind of giving him a little back. But Athena was like, 
“Them’s fighting words!” And she’s rolling up her sleeves.  
But then I heard a similar sentiment from another person. This was, I guess I probably won’t 
mention, but someone who is a key person at one of our local composting facilities, told a group of ECO 
AmeriCorps service members, one of whom was my service member, who worked with us last year, the 
same thing. These are like fresh-faced guys, kids, who just like got out of college. And they’re there 
because they want to serve. And they could make way more money if they went off and got a job. And 
they’re, I wouldn’t say they’re all naïve. But they’re kind of open-minded and this is all new to them. And 
here’s this guy saying oh, yeah, and he said something sort of dismissive and degrading about people who 
compost in their backyard. They should just bring it to him. And I went to him and called him out on that. 
And then I was at the VORS conference, the Vermont Organics Recycling Summit, which is a 
great conference and I’m not knocking the conference. But their keynote speaker last year—were you 
9 
 
there? Did you go to that VORS conference? I mean, it was a similar, she didn’t say anything dismissive 
about backyard composting. But she was talking about all their studies. And they were all about 
commercial scale composting. So I raised my hand and was like, “Well, what kind of studies do you have 
about backyard composting? What residents are doing.” And the answer was none. And I just, I realize 
that because I feel so passionate about it, it’s—I don't know, I’m really digressing here.  
But it made me realize that this is a key piece of, going back to solid waste management, people 
being able to handle it in their backyards. There’s a lot of reasons why it’s really important for solid waste 
management. One of which is that’s quicker, easier, cheaper. Keeps less trucks and cars on the road than 
having people put a, what, two or five-gallon bucket of food scraps in their car, drive somewhere, drop it 
off. The nutrients that could have gone into their own system on their property suddenly gets then picked 
up in a big truck and hauled somewhere else. So they’ve taken their nutrients and fertility out of their 
yard, spent all this, who knows what in carbon emissions, driving places to drop it off. Paying a fee to 
drop it off. So it can benefit somebody else’s property where then they sell the product. It just seems like 
it’s a good option if people really can’t compost on site. If they physically can’t, if they’re grossed out by 
it, if they don’t have the space. But anybody who likes the idea, has the space, physically can do it, I think 
it’s way more beneficial to the whole system that we tool people up for that. 
Oh, man, see, you just got my hot-button topic. (laughs) I just came around to that one. But so I 
think that’s where, I told you, I’m trying to create my job. So I’ve been doing more and more of these 
workshops and getting out all over the community. And I think that’s really where my passion is. I really 
want as many people as possible to be able to do this themselves. 
 
14:57 
 
Nickerson:  And when you say “this,” meaning composting? Or— 
 
Hemenway:  Composting, specifically, yes. But that’s part of overall. And that’s actually, I also mean all 
of it. Like the recycling I feel like is just one step away from trash, really. I mean it’s like if you really 
have no other way to handle the material, it can go in the recycling if it’s an acceptable material. But 
you’re better off not generating that material in the first place, if you can.  
But composting starts that process for people who have never done it before. Suddenly they look 
at something they saw as trash as a material, as a resource. And that’s the neat thing about these 
workshops. Probably why I get more satisfaction out of that than any other part of what I do. Because I 
get people there for whom this is a brand new thing for them, that it’s never occurred to them to touch 
their food scraps. They think food scraps are icky and gross. They haven’t thought it through that they’re 
ickier and grosser in a trash can than they are separated out and handled properly, and that it’s really easy 
to do it themselves. But they come to one workshop and they can learn how to do it. They just need that 
nudge. You know, here’s how to do it. It’s pretty easy. All you need is a bin. Make sure you stockpile 
some leaves or wood shavings. Turn it now and then. And at some point, you’re going to have something 
really nice for your garden. If you don’t, garden share it with someone who does. They will thank you for 
it. And you might get some of their garden produce out of it. And it’s that simple. I mean, you know, it’s 
not totally that simple. But that’s really satisfying, I think, when people who just, you know—that’s the 
place, that’s where that mind thing happens. 
I don't know why. I don't know how they get there in the first place. It’s probably because there’s 
so much information out in Vermont right now about the law, and about the food scrap ban coming down 
the pike. So people are starting to really think like—there’s a certain percentage who are never going to 
do it, don’t care. They’re going to flaunt it, they’re going to make a big deal out of, “I have every right to 
10 
 
throw my food scraps out.” And we all know, okay, you’re going to do it, we get it. But there’s a lot of 
people who actually do want to obey the law, even if they don’t have a compost police person at their 
steps. And so they’re trying to figure out what to do. 
 
17:16 
 
Nickerson:   So do you have stories about people who’ve attended the compost workshops and it’s been 
an "ah-ha" for them? 
  
Hemenway:  Yeah. There’s a bunch. I mean, I can’t think of a specific. I mean, there’s at least one at 
every workshop, sometimes more than one. Sometimes it’s like I’ve had people come, it’s new to them, 
but they’re also new to like either a mom or something, so they’re really like, they’re gathering the 
information for both of them. And then they get—when I know it’s clicked is when they buy [a bin], we 
sell the bins at half price, if we can. We’ve been able to get enough grant funding to subsidize the cost of 
the bin. So for 25 dollars, they can have a bin and start tomorrow.  
 
Nickerson:  That’s a great deal. 
 
Hemenway:  And it means that, if they buy a bin, I know that it’s been a good workshop. Because they’re 
not going to spend that money if they don’t plan to do it. And I’m trying to think of specific examples, 
because there’s so many people. I can just think of, like I’m not thinking of specific names, because I 
never really remember names. But I remember one person who was a mom and had kids. And one of the 
things I used to talk about in my workshops was worm composting. And I only talk about it because I 
think it’s fun, and funny. And sometimes I’ll bring my worm compost bin and share it and show people. 
And I stopped doing it because the majority of people, that’s way too gross. That’s like way over the line 
for what they can handle. And I don’t want to lose them. But every now and then, there’s one or two 
people who think it’s really cool, and they want to know how to get started.  
And this mom did. And I could tell that she was going to start doing that with her kid, because 
she had a ton of questions. And we actually were organized enough that we had a handout about how to 
get started. And that particular workshop, we had demonstrated how to build a worm bin. It’s really 
simple. So, I don't know, I don't think that’s a great story. 
I had one really sad story about a woman who came. She had just moved to town and was trying 
to figure out what to do. She came to my biggest workshop. I had it at the North Branch Nature Center. I 
had 80 people there. I know. (laughs) I know, it’s huge. And she was the last person in line. We sold 
something like 36 composters afterwards. And she wanted a composter. She kept going back and forth, 
back and forth. And it came down to her husband had forbade her to do that. And it sounded like, I wasn’t 
going to tell her what to do. I didn’t know the situation. And I wasn’t going to try to encourage her to do 
something that would be problematic for her life, but I was also like really hoping she would just get it 
and not allow him to forbid her to compost. (laughs) But I don't remember how that resolved, actually. I 
just kind of, “well, they’re here, and if you don’t buy it today, we have them other days.” You know, like 
we aren’t a social, we’re not a social justice organization, so I can’t get into that. But it did make me sad. 
But that’s it. You’re in people’s life. I mean, that’s trash. This is personal stuff, in a way. It’s what people, 
all of their personal decisions end up in the trash can eventually. (laughs) Or recycling. 
  
11 
 
Nickerson:  That’s really true. That’s very true. 
 
Hemenway:  We tried—is it okay if I keep blathering? Because I know you have questions. 
 
Nickerson:  No, no. That’s okay. 
 
20:52 
 
Hemenway:  When the district, back when Act 148 had just been passed, and we knew that there was this 
series of different pieces being implemented coming down the road. So this would have been like 2014, 
2013, maybe, the district board decided that—oh, I know, it was closer to 2015 because recycling was 
about to become mandatory. And we had had a mandatory recycling board for our district, for like a 
decade and a half already. But nobody followed it and we didn’t enforce it anyway. So now we had 
statewide mandatory recycling. And we thought the easiest way for that to work was to have, to mandate 
clear trash bags. Which has been done other places. And we didn’t anticipate the level of pushback we 
got. It wasn’t because we wanted to be the trash police and see people’s adult diapers in the trash or 
anything. It was really about like this is the simplest way to see if there’s recyclables in there or not. And 
it just became a big thing. People really, really were incensed about it. They were treating us like we were 
big government, and we were coming to stare at their trash. (laughs)  
 
Who’s that, there’s a local cartoonist. I want to say Danziger. He did a cartoon about it. (laughs) 
And it had like a sketch of our board sitting down while people like handed in their trash bags, and were 
making comments about the different things in the bags. So that one didn’t pass. I think the board just 
backed off were like, “Okay, okay! I give. I give.” So there are places where definitely, it’s a personal 
thing for people. 
 
22:38 
 
Nickerson:  Yeah, yeah. It’s a very touchy issue. What we throw out. And for folks to see what we throw 
out. 
 
Hemenway:  Yeah. I know. My God. But the fact is really, haulers, any hauler that they handle trash 
every day, they can pick up your black trash bag and they know what’s in it. They really do. They know if 
you’ve got recyclables in there, bottles or cans and jars. They can feel how heavy it is. It’s not like they 
know every specific item. But they pretty much know. And they don’t care. But you know, they’re kind 
of on the hook for the recycling law, because they could get turned away when they bring their load of 
trash to the landfill if it’s clear that there’s recyclables in there. I don't know if that’s actually happened; it 
probably hasn’t. But in theory, they could. So.  
23:27 
 
Nickerson:  So you do the composting workshops. What other kinds of workshops do you do? 
 
12 
 
Hemenway:  Well, we actually, believe it or not, we do recycling workshops. We haven’t done any in a 
while. But those requests often come from businesses or organizations that have a big staff. And it’s 
because there’s been some internal disagreement about recycling. And then they’ll call us and say, “Can 
you come tell us how to do it?” And so it’s actually kind of fun. I mean to me, I think composting is way 
more exciting than recycling. But it’s basically what do we do with this stuff? And always, we’ll go 
through the law and we go through what are the six materials that go in the blue bin. Then people just, 
pretty much, we don’t have to plan a long presentation. Because half of it is questions. And everybody 
has questions. And once they’re sitting in the room, then they really actually want to know. “Well, what 
about this, or what about that? Is this okay or is that okay? Or where do I take”—and then that gives us 
the opportunity to talk about what we take here at the ARC, or you know, all the, there’s dozens and 
dozens of other places things can go. 
 
And then people are like, “Oh my God, this is really confusing. Why can’t we just take it all to 
one place?” Because. Because we aren’t big government. Because we actually live in a state and in a—I 
would say, I don't know if this is the case everywhere in the country, but that really values independence. 
And we don’t have everything operated by one big governmental entity. And by the way, people, I never 
say this, but I think it—“you buy it, you deal with it. And if you don’t like how you deal with it, don’t buy 
it.” I mean, I never say that. But when someone looks at me like I’m personally responsible for figuring 
out what to do with their Styrofoam packaging. And I’m like, you know, you have the option not to buy 
that thing. I’m not saying you shouldn’t. I would buy the TV, too. But you chose to buy it. You chose to 
accept the packaging. So it’s your responsibility. It’s not mine. And it’s not society’s—well, it is 
society’s, but we’re working on that. 
25:38 
 
And then someone always brings up what we all know, that manufacturers, product packaging 
design, all that stuff really needs to change. That’s the heart of it. How products are designed. And I feel 
sometimes so helpless in the face of all the products that are designed as single-use. You know? Or 
planned obsolescence. The e-waste thing. I’m sure Mike talked to you about e-waste. It’s ridiculous. All 
these precious heavy metals that are in our electronics that destroy the earth mining for them, and destroy 
people’s lives. And they’re toxic, and they’re valuable. And people just throw them away. And they’re 
designed for that, and they don’t have to be. It’s just about like there’s more profit in designing it for—
you know all this. So then we’re the people who deal with what happens when people throw it away. Or 
hopefully at least recycle it.  
 
But that’s what I mean by I think recycling is your next step to the trash can. Okay, you have this 
smartphone that you upgraded. And yay, you, you didn’t throw it in the trash, where it would turn into 
toxic leaching in the landfill. But recycling it isn’t as good as seeing if it could have more life somewhere 
else. Sell it on eBay or give it to someone who needs a phone. Keep it being used as long as possible 
before recycling it, at least. Which often isn’t the case with technology, because it’s also designed to just 
not be functional after a period of time. Because they design software that requires more and more of the 
devices. 
 
27:28 
 
Nickerson:  So I think that, didn’t the district offer sort of a fix it workshop that— 
 
Hemenway:  Yes. Oh, I’m glad you brought that up, that is the other thing where you said “What kind of 
workshops?” You were leading up to that. Yeah. We have—so you’re talking about Repair Cafes? This is 
my little heart project, too. Because years ago I heard about Repair Cafés, and it seemed like this amazing 
13 
 
thing happening other places. And I kept thinking, oh, why don’t we do this? I know we could do this. 
And everybody at the district was excited about the idea. But then when it came down to the practicality, 
it's like okay, well where’s the staff? Who’s going to run it? And is it going to be at the ARC? Where at 
the ARC? This space is a weird space. We don’t really have a spot for it. And ultimately we found a 
webinar where we learned that most people who hold Repair Cafés actually hold them at, you know, like 
at churches and schools and other places. 
 
So we got this awesome opportunity to get an ECO AmeriCorps service member. And I was 
lucky enough to be able to write the project description. Just because I’m in outreach, and those positions 
are typically outreach positions. So I was like, we’re going to have this person do Repair Cafés. And we 
got Cara Stapleford, our ECO AmeriCorps person. And we just did a lot of learning and research and 
talking to people. My hometown, Northampton, has a really neat solid waste program. They actually only 
have one person, and she’s an employee of the city. So it’s a very different setup than what we have. But 
she holds like four or five Repair Cafés a year. Yeah. And she has a bigger budget. Probably because they 
only have one person, so they don’t have all that personnel, staff expense. So we talked to her, learned 
from her how it’s done. And we found a community partner. I don't think we could have done it without a 
community partner. 
29:26 
 
But the concept is great. It’s really, what I learned through this process is it’s not just about fixing 
things. Which is really what I thought it was in the beginning. I thought, this is cool. Fixing things is 
another way to keep them out of the landfill and give more life to the stuff you own. But it’s also about 
the right to fix. That was the part where I got educated about that. And we actually now have in 
Vermont—you should look up specifically what it is. But it’s like, this came out of some proposed 
legislation this past session, for the right to repair. And actually here comes Cara. She could—we’re 
doing a taped interview. But come on in and do your thing. And don’t worry about hurrying. Just do what 
you need to do. 
 
So the Vermont now, after we did these two Repair Cafés, simultaneously this right to repair 
legislation came through. And now, they didn’t pass it, but there’s now a committee. And I want to find 
out how I can get on it. Because it’s all about like studying the right to repair and why it exists and why it 
should be important to Vermonters.  
And you know, some of the things I didn’t know that I’m learning is that there are companies that 
withhold repair manuals from people who buy their materials. They design things so that you can’t get 
into them to fix them. They make it really difficult. Or I recently learned Tesla, that used to be my dream 
car, dream company, they’re the worst of the worst on this. Tesla apparently not only witholds repair 
information, they don’t allow, like you cannot get a Tesla fixed if it’s not—not just not a Tesla dealer. But 
they make it extraordinarily difficult to get to a Tesla dealer.  If you want to get a bolt or something, they 
give you a really hard time. And they’ll question you as if you’ve committed a crime: Why do you want 
this bolt? What are you going to do with this? (laughs)  
And so, the Repair Cafés are kind of fit in, we learned, we recruit volunteer fixers. So we get 
people who are volunteering their time who have a really marketable skill, and some of them do it for a 
living. And they come and they sit and wait for people to bring them their broken things. 
 
31:55 
 
Nickerson:  So for example, who were some of your volunteer fixers? 
 
14 
 
Hemenway:  So they ranged from people who fix like phones and computers and electronics to people 
who fix appliances. We had people who did gluing. At one of our cafés, we had a gluer. And people 
brought in ceramics and wood and broken things like that that needed some professional level gluing. 
We’ve had people who do sewing. We had one person come in who fixes bodies. She did massage 
therapy. We had bicycle fixer. We’ve had woodworkers. Not just wood gluing, but people do carpentry 
skills. Just a really, really big range. And it’s all, every café is different, because it depends on who 
volunteers. 
 
But what we learned was the people who are really good at fixing don’t have all this knowledge 
in their head. We have to get places with really good high-speed internet as a location. Because they 
Google it, you know? And they have websites where you can download repair manuals. So iFixit is one 
of those websites. It’s I fix it, literally. I-f-i-x-i-t. And they have a repair manifesto, about the right to 
repair. And you can look up all these repair manuals that the companies are trying to keep from people. 
 
So our fixers kind of like our volunteers, like they knew this. They’re people who fix things. And 
the idea is that if say you, Ginger, came in, and you brought in your broken tape recorder, you wouldn’t 
just drop it off and go away. You would sit there with your fixer and learn how they’re doing it. You 
might not walk away with a fixing skill. But what I learned was, okay, I came in, I had dropped my, 
literally, my phone fell out of my back pocket into the toilet two days before the event. And I did what I 
thought was the right thing and put it in a bag of rice, which did nothing. And I went to the fixers. I saw 
them Googling it. I learned that my impossible to open Galaxy, Samsung Galaxy, could be opened with a 
special heating gun. But it took a lot of time and patience. And also they had special tools. So that was 
another learning thing for me. Like oh, if I had the tools, there are certain things I could do, not a lot. So 
they had special tools specifically for phones. And then a lot of it was, they kept looking up online. Okay, 
here’s a problem, what do I do. And then some of it was patience. Like for that it was opening up the 
phone and basically blowing a hair dryer on it for a really long time.  
But to me it was like wow, I can’t believe I didn’t know this. That this isn’t just a feel-good thing 
about teaching people to fix. It’s really about like people have a right to fix their things. It’s starting to 
fight back with legislation around withholding repair manuals and repair information from people who 
buy those products. I’m purposely staying away from the word “consumer,” because I hate that word. 
But, you know what I mean? It’s like, so, yeah,-- 
And Cara, who just walked in the door, was our ECO AmeriCorps person who actually organized 
and held the cafés, with our partner organization, Onion River Exchange. And now we want to, what we 
want to do is amplify what we do. So we’ve held a couple of these with a partner. Now we’re going to 
give a presentation to the public next week about how to do it. And that’s Thursday, the 20th, 5:30 pm at 
the Memorial Room in city hall, in Montpelier City Hall. And we’ve had a lot of people come to the cafés 
and want to know how they can hold their own. We can hand them a manual. We have a manual. But it’s 
a lot easier to just have a conversation with somebody and see the photos and ask questions. So that’s our 
next step is we want to open it up to anybody who wants to hold a café. Come learn how we did it. It’s 
not the only way. There’s lots of different ways people approach it.  
35:56 
We learned things like it’s really important to have liability insurance. And without an 
organization that can provide that, the café’s probably not a good idea. So we have lots of things we learn. 
And our organization can provide that, but not everyone can. So. 
 
36:16 
 
Nickerson:  Are you okay if I ask a few more questions? 
15 
 
 
Hemenway:  Yeah, I’m fine. Thank you. 
 
Nickerson:  Great. I want to ask about Waste Warriors. 
 
Hemenway:  Oh, yay!  
 
Nickerson:  Tell me about Waste Warriors. 
 
Hemenway:  Waste Warriors! So that is a total copy, copy and paste from Chittenden Waste District. But 
Waste Warriors is a name that we borrowed, or stole, but we borrowed with permission for our volunteers 
who get trained in how to help people reduce waste at events. So we’re talking about big festivals, or even 
smaller events like community barbecues. But mainly they’re, like this weekend, the Tunbridge World's 
Fair; it’s a four-day event that brings in fifty thousand people. So they’re trained in all of the stuff. They 
get sort of a crash course in recycling and composting in Vermont. And they also learn a little bit about 
like how the, the specifics of how we’re going to manage the materials at the event. 
 
So the Waste Warriors get trained. And then they sign up for events. And they work typically a 
three-hour shift. And they just basically monitor a waste-sorting station that has a trash recycling and 
compost option. And they help people figure out where their stuff goes. And it can be as simple as, they 
can point to the bin and let people do it themselves. We don’t let them do it for people. Or it could turn 
into a conversation where some of these other, more detailed things come up. So that’s another education 
opportunity. But it also is a big help. Because recycling and composting at events is almost pointless if 
you don’t have a human being monitoring the waste stations. As soon as one person accidentally puts a 
napkin in the recycling bin, the recycling bin becomes a trash bin. And then it’s all trash. So we were 
really happy that Chittenden had that program that we could basically model after. And we got the grant 
funding to get it up and running. It’s been really successful. I’ve been excited about it. 
 
38:27 
 
Nickerson:  Can you make any generalizations about the people who sign up to be Waste Warriors? 
 
Hemenway:  Sure, I could. Now our zero waste events coordinator, Jan, has really trained everybody. But 
I did notice what we find is the people who come are really into this stuff. They’re like me. These are the 
people who are like, you know, they’re already doing recycling and composting at home, and probably a 
thousand times more. So one of the issues we come up with is we get caught up in the weeds big time 
when we’re trying to train them. Because they get all like worried about like what are we going to do with 
the bottle caps? When the reality at events is, we can only manage the materials that are like on the 
mandated list—bottles, glass, paper, cardboard, metals. We can’t handle all the 500 million other things 
that could be recycled if we just got it to the right place. So we do have to sort of rein people, we’re 
finding we have to rein people in and have them sublimate that part of themselves for the three-hour shift. 
And kind of realize that for the rest of the world, this is kind of baby steps. And just figuring out that they 
can scrape their plate, you know, food scraps into this bin and put their soda bottle into that bin. You 
know, like that concept is about as far as some people can deal with without their head popping. So, yeah. 
16 
 
I mean, if I were going to generalize, that’s how I would do it. Say we get people really, really into 
reducing or eliminating waste. 
 
39:58 
 
Nickerson:  So the folks who’ve been maybe first-time volunteers, Waste Warriors, what kinds of stuff 
have they been telling you about their experiences? 
 
Hemenway: Well, so, actually Jan has been running the program and I haven’t had direct conversations. 
But, yeah, I personally haven’t. so I will be interested to find out. I think what, I mean, mostly we learned 
what we already knew. Which is if you turn your back for a second, something goes in the wrong bin. 
And I don't know, I think, it sounds like every time I’ve done anything with the public, which has been a 
lot by now, there’s always one grumpy, jerky person. And so there’s always one grumpy, jerky person 
who gets pissed off because they have to scrape their plate or whatever. So that comes up every time. But 
mostly they find that people are interested and they ask questions. But if you turn your back, they’re 
going to put, you know, trash in the recycling bin. (laughs) So, that’s kind of like in a nutshell how it goes 
at events. 
 
41:00 
 
Nickerson:  So what is your favorite or the best part of your job? [phone interruption]  
  
Hemenway:  That was someone from Hinesburg who wants to use the ARC. (laughs)  
 
Nickerson:  Oh my gosh! Someone who’s passionate. Yeah. 
 
Hemenway:  Yeah. But I was like, but please have something else to do in the area, too. (laughs) Like 
please don’t drive here just to drop off your toothpaste tubes. 
 
Nickerson:  I’m so glad you take toothpaste tubes, too. 
 
Hemenway:  Yeah, I know. Me, too. I have three kids. I go through a lot of toothpaste. 
 
44:11 
 
Nickerson:  Okay. So what’s your favorite, best part of the job question. And I just have like three other 
questions. Do you have time for it? 
 
17 
 
Hemenway:  Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I do. I should probably go no later than quarter of five. 
 
Nickerson:  Oh, no. We’ll be done. We’ll be done significantly before that. 
 
Hemenway:  All right. Favorite part of the job. Okay. Favorite part of the job is talking to people. So 
whether it’s at a compost workshop and I’m answering questions and dialoging with people, or whether 
it’s at an event and I’m just, I’ve got my face in their car window and we’re talking about answering 
questions, that like—and I have to say, I’m actually an introvert. So when I run an event and I’m talking 
to people all day, I’m out of commission for two days afterwards. It really like physically exhausts me. 
But that’s where I get the most job satisfaction. Because I can see people’s faces and expressions. I can 
hear the tone of their voice. I can tell if they’re actually learning something or not. And just having that 
dialog is the most effective way to reach people. So that’s what I love the most about what I do, for sure. 
  
45:24 
 
Nickerson:  And then how about your least favorite, or the most challenging aspect of your job? 
 
Hemenway:  Oh, I forgot. One more favorite part of my job. I love to get dirty. (laughs) That’s my 
favorite part of the job. When I’m actually composting, like demonstrating and I stick my hands right in 
it. Or we’re working here at the ARC and we’re covered in dust from, we built some compost bins. We 
had our steel-toed boots on and our power tools. That part is also, just being like hands-in, you know, I’m 
not at a desk. I love that.  
 
So, least favorite part? 
 
45:59 
   
Nickerson:  Yeah. Or most challenging. 
 
Hemenway:  Most challenging? Uh, for me, that’s really around doing the parts of my job that I have to 
do because I’m a manager-level person, that are related to like policy or board-level type requests. Or sort 
of on a more global level where I have to come up with messaging for something that’s political. I’m the 
communications person, so that runs the gamut from talking to somebody about what to do with their 
toothbrush tubes, or toothbrushes, to what is the most politic type of message that we can all use on this 
sensitive topic that might piss off our member towns, and keep them from withdrawing from the district? 
So that political stuff, I’m not that excited about. But it’s part of my job. I’ve got to do that, too. 
 
47:01 
 
Nickerson:  So, thirty years from now, do you think that Central Vermont Solid Waste Management 
District will have an outreach coordinator? Do you think somebody will be doing your job? 
18 
 
 
Hemenway:  That’s a good question. I highly doubt it, honestly. Maybe. But thirty years from now, what 
year are we in by then? We’re almost at 2050 by then? Yeah. (laughs) Twenty-fifty. 
 
Nickerson:  Let’s just say in 2050. 
 
Hemenway:  I think if the district exists then, still, because things happen. Who knows? Maybe the state 
will change the whole district system. But let’s pretend the district still exists. They’re going to have to 
have somebody who does communications. For sure. I don't know if it will be exactly what I do. It most 
definitely wouldn’t be the exact roles that I’ve explained to you here. I would like to think and dream that 
some of this stuff will be second nature in 30 years. Like what if we’re successful and the repair stuff 
becomes, like we change the culture of how that is addressed and like companies, we’re able to like 
probably have to force companies to reveal their mystical repair manuals, and people get, you know, then 
there’s going to be some other challenge, some other waste. Or maybe waste management will be—I 
don't know, I’m trying to think of a futuristic version of my like fantasy waste management. Maybe it will 
be more about like, who knows? Less about trash in landfills, and more about processing materials, 
getting them back into circulation.  
But there’s always going to be a need to educate. I mean, Vermont is way ahead of the country. 
And we have a boatload of work to do. So I don't think we’re ever going to not need someone who does 
the communication piece. Sadly. (laughs) Or happily. (laughs)  
48:55 
 
Nickerson:  So is there anything that we have not covered that you would like people to know about your 
job? Or about waste management? 
 
Hemenway:  Well, let me think about that. Yeah, I just blathered for quite a while. I’m trying to think of, I 
mean, there’s a lot we didn’t cover. I think, this is probably something you’ve heard from other people 
already. But a lot of what happens to people who are in this kind of a role, we’re a semi-utility, but we’re 
not really a utility. You know, like in the sense of electric and water. Our role is more to help people 
figure out what to do than, we don’t necessarily provide the outlet for everything, even though we do have 
the ARC. I think people, we get a lot of people thinking that somebody out there has responsibility for 
their stuff. And I’ve heard stories from like the attendant at the Casella residential drop off site, where one 
woman physically harmed him because he informed her that she had to pay two dollars and 50 cents for 
her recyclables. She may not have in her mind intentionally done it, but she slammed her hatchback down 
and it hit him in the head. And he was on the ground on his knees. Because she was angry that there was a 
two dollar and 50 cent fee for her recyclables. Now that’s the most extreme that I’ve heard.  
But all of us, even me and like my world is very different than the world of a transfer station 
attendant or a hauler. But all of us in this world basically bear the brunt of people thinking that we’re 
responsible for the stuff that they bought and chose to throw away. And that’s the piece of this kind of 
work, is sort of like just either just letting that roll off your back, or talking to people about you know, 
you can’t, it’s really, people won’t hear you if you tell them, “No, it’s your responsibility. (laughs) You 
bought the stuff. This is how it’s handled in our area. So nobody owes you anything because you chose to 
buy all this stuff.”  
But I don't know what I’m getting at. Except I think that’s the piece of the job that nobody really 
talks about. But it’s always there. There’s always that undertone of someone will all and ask about what 
19 
 
to do with something. If we don’t have the answer they like, sometimes some people will get angry. And 
you know, even furious and rage-full sometimes. And it really is about the fact that they chose to bring 
something into their life without considering the end life of it. And now they have a responsibility, and 
they want someone else to bear it. And I’m sure you’ve run into that with everyone you’re talking to. But, 
it’s there.  
And my challenge is to not say what I think when I get that. (laughs) See, I’m saying what I think 
with you. But if I were on the phone with somebody from the general public, I would never actually—
maybe we should start doing that. (laughs) I’d get fired. I have to be nice to the public.

Nickerson:  So is there anything else that you want to— 
  
Hemenway:  Just that, you know, waste doesn’t have to exist. You know? It really doesn’t. Even if it’s 
like a message, or it’s about the job, it’s really about like thinking about what happens to your trash and 
your recycling and your food scraps can be applied to any part of your life. And maybe I’m trying to hard 
to be like Grasshopper. (laughs) But I think that’s, yeah. I think I’m just blathering now. I don't think 
there’s anything else. Or I’ll think of it tonight when I wake up in the middle of the night or something. 
 
Nickerson:  Well, I am very grateful for everything that you shared. 
 
Hemenway:  Thank you. 
 
Nickerson:  And I think it was really wonderful hearing what you had to say. 
 
Hemenway:  Oh, good. (laughs)  
 
Nickerson:  Thank you so much, Cassandra. I appreciate [your sharing your time and experience]
