An Irish character duet. 
Words and music by JouN" T 
K ELLY, as originally sung with wonderful success by the great 
"Bards of Tara," KELLY & 
il YAX. 
The kit of the season. 
Kind friends just listen now to us, 
And well sing to you a 
rhyme, 
And tell you of our youthful days, 
When we were in our prime. 
Were getting old, yes very old, 
And soon must pass away, 
We've traveled on life's weary road, 
With spirits always gay. 
CHORUS. 
Old Mr. and Mrs. Malone, 
Old Mr. and Mrs. Malone, 
A jollier old pair you'll seldom find--
Than Mr. and Mrs. Malone, 
'Tis now sonic sixty years ago 
Since we first joined our lot, 
And in that time there's nothing wrong 
Transpired in our cot. 
We've had our share of sunshine, 
And of course we can't complain; 
Them good old days that's passed mid gone. 
Can never conic back again. 
Old 2.0.r. and Mrs. &c. 
As performed only by " The Bards of Tara," KELLY 4; RYAN, 
at the Theatre Comique, N. Y., and all the first class Variety 
Theatres in the United States. 
Everywhere received with 
roars of laughter and applause. 
We are two Irish boys so frisky, 
None better sure you can't find, 
To twirl the twig, or drink strong whiskey, 
Or bate a 
big foe, do you mind; 
If the four- leafed shamrock we could get now, 
All bare footed cripples would be shod ; 
No pc,or needle woman would sit down: 
But be gay, like the boys that carry the hod. 
• Cumws: 
Drink success to Irish labor, 
Just new over from the sod ; 
All we want is laborers' wages, 
For we're the boys that carry the hod. 
We'd have no shifting politicians, 
But every man would honest be ; 
Old starvation, he'd have no relation, 
And all ould Ireland would be free; 
We'd have Saturday night three times a 
week, 
Fine roast beef, and less salt cod; 
Then every one would happy be, 
Just like the boys that carry the hod. 
Drink success &e.

Lards of Tara," KELLY & RYAS. 
We're a 
pair of ould Irish junkmen. 
We buy up what e're we can find, 
We work hard at ou - oeeupation, 
In picking up junk of MI kind. 
From the lear ould. green land of shamrock 
A few years ago we came out, 
As partners we started this business, 
And from morning ' till night we do shout--
CHORUS. 
Any old rags, 
(Symph.) 
Any old bottles. (Sympli.) 
Any old rags to put, in our bags, 
Have ye any old rags or bottles to- day. 
When we landed with only two shillings, 
We was told by a 
loafer named Burke 
To go to a 
Bladder refinery, 
And the boss he would put us to work. 
Faith we soon found out all their queer tricks, 
There jokes. their stalls and their gags, 
So we put the two shillings together, 
And started at bottles and rags. 
Nov before we leave we must tell you 
That we love to deal honestly. 
So if ye have old rags or bottle3. 
We'll come buy them all do you see: 
For all kinds of rags whatsoever. 
We'll pay the best price that is out. 
We'll come with our cow- bells a 
ringing. 
And at the top of our voice we will shout— 
Any old rags, U.

Words and music by JoHN T. 
KELLY, originally performed 
by the only 
Bards of Tara," KELLY & RYAN, with immense 
success. 
Here we are two scrubbing women, 
At this trade we make our living, 
Working hard the livelong day, 
For our rent and debts to pay. 
Our husbands, they were both of them brothers, 
From old Ireland they ran, 
Carrviug the hod was their daily labor, 
Pat and Dan Gilhoolihan. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, please to take pity, 
(Symph.) 
While we sing our sorrowful ditty, 
(Sy mph.) 
We're washing, scrubbing and singing all day, 
And minding our children our time goes away. 
Repeat last two lima. 
Now we hope ye'll all have pity 
On its poor widders from the old sod, 
We can't find a 
job in the whole city, 
And to starve, by the powers now that's no cod, 
Here we've been these last five years, sirs, 
Left with children big and strong. 
I 
have three—and I 
have four, sirs, 
And there all of them happy as the day is long. 
Oh, please to, ,te-

As originully sung by the Inimitable " Bardt] of Tara," KEr.r.v 
& RYAN, at all the 
principal 
Theat-es throughout 
country with tremendous applause. 
We've shoveled coal since early mo -n, 
Now for our boarding house we're bent ; 
One dollar a 
day is what they pay. 
Troth that's divilish easy spent. 
In a 
great big, ship down here in the dock-, 
That's filled from top to bot'mm with coal, 
It's there every morning we do flock, 
And shovel all day down in the hole. 
Shoveling coal now that's our busine;Q, 
Every night it's home we stroll, 
We're full of fun, and sometimes whiskey, 
Hurrah for the lads that shovel the coal. 
We wish the times would only get better. 
So all could work throughout the land ; 
How many poor men now are staring, 
While the rich in luxury liCPS 30 grand. 
If we were rulers of the United States, 
We'd take a 
very different plan, 
We'd make all rich Quid rascals work, 
And give their place to the laboring man.

Tin OLD OAK TREE, 
Words and Music by JOHN T. 
KELLY. 
Will soon be published 
by Wu. A. POND 
Co., 547 Broadway, New York. 
sung with immense success by MISS ALICE VE RINA. 
I'm sitting by the old oak tree. 
Where oft in days gone by, 
We sat and told our tales of love, 
My Alice dear and I. 
How sad to think that all must fade, 
But the saddest thing to me 
Is when I 
think of other days, 
Down by that old oak tree. 
That little stream that ran close by, 
Still murmurs on the same, 
And the rustic bridge where oft we stood, 
And spoke each other's name. 
The country roadside where we walked, 
They all bring back to me, 
When all alone of love we talked 
Down by that old oak tree. 
How quiet seems the resting place 
Where Alice she was laid, 
Where birds they sing in summer time 
And blossoms bloom and fade. 
How well I 
know we all must die, 
My only wish would be, 
To lay me down by Alice dear, 
Beneath that old oak tree. 
GOD BLESS YOU, COLLEEN. 
Words and Music by HARRY KENNEDY. 
Sung by the Favorite Balladist, Miss ALICE IYE RINA. 
The shores of dear Erin recede from my sight, 
As swiftly our bark glides the waters so bright ; 
And eager I 
look, with a 
sorrowful gaze 
Upon the dear land where I've passed all my days. 
My thoughts turn to home, and the dear faces there, 
And for my dear Kathleen I 
breathe a 
fond prayer, 
And say, as the land quickly fades from my view, 
God bless. 
you, Colleen, I 
know you'll be true. 
CHORUS. 
God bless you, Colleen, I 
know you'll be true, 
True to the heart that beats only for you ; 
Think of me, darling, when from you I 
stray, 
God bless you, Colleen, when I'm far away. 
A 
tear dimmed my eyes, as with feeling oppressed, 
I 
stilted the sob that arose in my breast ; 
And thought of the long days of sorrow and pain, 
Before I 
c,oual see thee, my darling again. 
That night in my dream I 
returned to my home, 
And through the green meadows with Kathleen did roam, 
But making the old words come back anew, 
God bless you, Colleen, I 
know you'll be true. 
God bless you, etc.

May we shortly meet again, 
And we well take another cruiskcen. 
Lawn, lawn, lawn; 
And we'll take another cruiskeen lawn.

THE MERRY TINKERS, 
Words and Music by JOHN T. 
KELLY. 
As sung with great success by the wonderful character 
actors, " The Bards of Tara," KELLY tk, RYAN. 
Good evening to yott all, 
We hope we see you well, 
We thought we'd make a 
call, 
So hear what we've to tell. 
O'Rooney, that's our name, 
We're brothers, Mike and Dan, 
From Ireland , boys, we Caine, 
Two honest, laboring men. 
Now we were made two tinkers by trade, 
We'll tell you .the reason why, 
'When we were young, we first began 
To tinker on the sly ; 
But now we're on the road, 
So give us but a 
chance, 
'We'll show to you a 
thing or two, 
In Irish song and dance. 
CHORUs.—Duct. 
With our blang, blang, blang, 
And our clang, clang, clang, 
To your pots and your kettles we'll attend. 
With our blang, blang, blang, 
And our clang, clang, clang, 
Have ye any tin ware to mend. 
We'll mend your old kettles, 
Your boilers and baking pans, 
Your coffee potF, your tea pots, 
or any kind of cans. 
We never deal in poliiics, 
Yet how handy we could be, 
To soOder and patch 
What fraud has cracked, 
And mend tile country. 
We soon shall stop our roving, 
When it comes on winter time, 
'Tis then we work inside our shop, 
'Where our trade it is so fine. 
But now we must away, 
Please remember, if you can, 
The merry old Irish tinkers, 
Brothers Mike and Dan. 
Duet Chorms% 
With our wack, wack, wack, 
And our quack, quack, quack, 
Soddering all the day. 
With our quack, quack, quack, 
And our wack, wack, 
We pass our time away. 
Repeat chorus.

THEY A
LL DO IT. 
Written and composed by JOE1N READ. 
Arranged by II. W. Frrcurrr. 
Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Copyright, 1877, by E. H . H ARDING, 229 Bowery, opposite 
Prince St., N. Y. 
Price 10 cents. 
Some folks will cry " Oh ! shame, Mrs. Jones, you are to blame, 
I 
never should have thought it, ma'am, of you," 
While, if they'd look at home before abroad they'd roam, 
I'm positive they'd have enough to do. 
Mrs. Brown say S 
it's a 
sin. that Mrs. Smith drinks gin, 
And harbors " tally- men " from day to day ; 
While Mrs. Green was caught doing what she hadn't ought, 
When she in self defencs was heard to say— 
CnoRI7S. 
"They all do it, they all do it, 
They all do it, though ofttimes they rue it; 
Yet they all do it, they all do it, 
And so it will continue to the end of the world!" 
For hours three or four, lovers Ppooning at the door, 
On any moonlight evening may be seen ; 
Though if they want a 
lark, they have it in the dark, 
And they " do it," though they say " they didn't mean," 
When creeping down the stairs, comes the old man unawares, 
And kissing catch the couple in the act; 
The mother, from above, says " Don't interfere, my love, 
You can't dispute this most important fact—" 
They all do it, etc. j 
Old women do declare, girls should never dye their hair, 
And then again they say it's very wrong; 
Without the least restraint, their faces so to paint, 
And rob the easy chair for their chignon. 
Each girl a 
little puff, has inside a 
little muff, 
They are never seen without it, night or day; 
And her pretty nose she'll powder, if a 
moment is allowed her, 
When, if you laugh, she'll innocently say— 
They all do it, etc, 
But what does most impress, is the style in which they dress, 
It's enough to make you laugh when them you see; 
They've a 
hat upon their heads, large enough to make up beds, 
For pussy cats with kittens two or three. 
In their panniers, too, behind, if examined you would find, 
The most important papers of the day; 
The Chronicle and Chimes, the Telegraph and Times. 
Or anything that chance puts in their way. 
They all do it, etc. 
There's my neighbor, Dinah Down, brught two lovely boys to 
town, 
And her husband gets but one pound one per week; 
You often hear him say, " If things io on this way, 
We'll a 
lodging in the Union have to seek! 
For the doctor and the nurse, will drain my scanty purse, 
With many more expenses to defray:" 
Then he gets into a 
passion, when they tell him " it's the 
fashion," 
And they soothe him as they sing this truthful lay— 
They all do it, etc. 
PATRICK MIND THE BABY! 
?Sang in HARRIGAN aadAnts Great Sketch of the " Brady*." 
copyrighted 1876. rrj, 
A. J. FISHER, 98 Nassau St., New York. 
I'm the father of a 
bouncing girl, 
With cheeks like cherries red; 
She's a 
credit to the neighborhood, 
I'm only twelve months wed. 
When I 
come home from labor 
After toiling all the day, 
Me wife puts :Kelly in me arms, 
And this to to me did say— 
Arrah Patrick mind the baby, 
Arrah can't you mind the child! 
Tie it up in an over-coat. 
She's surely going wild. 
Arrah Patrick mind the baby, 
Mind the child awhile! 
She'll kick and bite, 
And cry all night, 
Arrah Patrick mind the child. 
There was castor-oil, and soothing syrup, 
And paregoric to,

O'ER THE HILLS AND DALES SO GRAND, 
Written by B. DAviEs, expressly for JENNIE 11nanzs. 
I 
CAME from dear Old Ireland, with very little money, 
crossed the great big ocean, the Yankee folks to see, 
I've beard of great big wonders, but very few I've seen now, 
So if you'll wait, why I'll relate, the wonders which I've seen. 
Of the hills and dales so grand, that's seen in Paddy's land, 
The boys and girls of our dear Isie, so beautiful to see, 
Driving on a 
jaunting car, with Paddy by my side, 
When the moon is shining brightly, along the road we glide. 
There's a 
pretty place called Dublin, 
What can equal that great city, 
For learning and for excellence 01 Erm's gallant sons, 
To the memory of departed worth, I'll spake of Dan 
O'Connell. 
Emmett, Moore and Grattan for the services these have 
done. 
There's the " Dargle" and the " Devil's Glen," in the County 
Wicklow, 
The sweet Lakes of Killarney, in Kerry County too, 
Not forgetting " Blarney Castle," you all know what I 
mean 
now, 
For there of course the boys all go, to kiss the Blarney stone.

TWO ORPHANS. 
Composed and sung by P. J. DOWNEY. 
Air.—" Over the Hills to the Poor-House." 
The evening's bright stars they were shining, 
The moonbeams shone clear on our land, 
Our city was in peace and quietness, 
The hour of midnight near at hand. 
But hark! do you hear that cry? 
Fire! 
How dismal those bells they do sound; 
Our BrooklYn Theatre is burning ! 
Alas, burning fast to the ground. 
CHORUS. 
We ne'er can forget the " Two Orphans," 
Bad luck seems to be in its wake, 
It seems it were brought to our city. 
The lives of our dear friends to take, 
The doors they were open at seven, 
The curtain was rolled up at eight ; 
Them that had got seats they ‘
NN re happy, 
Outside they were mad that were late. 
The play it went on very smoothly, 
Till sparks from the scenes they did fly ; 
Its then that men, women and children, 
"Oh, God, save our lives !" they did cry, 
WE 
ne'er can, etc. 
25 
Next morn in amongst those black ruins, 
Oh, God! what a 
sight met our eyes 
The dead they were lying in all shapes, 
Some there that none could recognize. 
Poor mothers there weeping and crying, 
For sons that were out all that night; 
Oh, God! let their souls rest in heaven, 
Amongst the innocent and bright. 
We ne'er can, etc. 
What means this large gathering of people, 
Upon such a 
cold dreary day? 
Or what means this long line of hearses, 
With tops plumed in feathery array. 
Far Out to the cemetery of Greenwood, 
Where the wind makes the lone willow sigh, 
'Tis there where the funeral is going, 
The poor unknown dead there to lie. 
We ne'er can, etc.

BEHIND THE SCENES, 
As sung by W ILL. :MORTON. 
When but a 
little boy, oh, it really was my joy 
To visit the theatre, I'll admit, 
And how happy I 
would be, the performances to see 
While seated in the gallery or pit. 
I 
fancied all was real, that the curtain did reveal, 
But since that I 
have passed beyond my teens ; 
I 
begin to understand, though in front it may look grand 
It's very different just behind the scenes. 
So if if you will attend for a 
moment, now my friends, 
I'll do the best within my humble means, 
To show to you to :night, though in front it may look bright, 
It's very different just behind the scenes. 
The comedian is one, who, while causing lots of fun, 
His heart may yet hang heavy in his breast ; 
And he who plays the king, though it seems a 
curious thing, 
In private may be very poorly dressed. 
Then the ballet girl so fair, who goes floating through the air, 
And looks like little angels there instead ; 
Sometimes they have to roam, into a 
wretched home, 
And oftentimes go supperless to bed. 
And those who play the parts, of the men with stony hearts, 
And look as if their tempers were like fiends ; 
Could you see them while away, you certainly would say 
They're the mildest looking men behind the scenes. 
Now there's many a 
married pair, I've no doubt you are aware, 
Who in public are so tender and so kind; 
But could you only see them at home in privacy, 
A 
very different state of things you d 
find. 
Sometimes it is the wife who causes all the strife, 
Sometimes it is the husband who's to blame ; 
• 
• 
But be that as it may, who causc.i all the fray, 
Their quarreling continues just the same. 
And oft they try to hide from all the world outside, 
The snarls and jars with which their household tee= , 
And often when you hear them call each other dear, 
They hate each (filer just behind the scenes. 
Now its just the same in life, though what lots of care and 
strife. 
And suffering some folks will undergo 
Just to cut a 
shine, and to make thewselves look tine, 
They think of nothing else but outside show. 
Some fancy and suppose, that those who wear good clothes, 
Always are they richest and the best ; 
But an honest heart and mind, is respected most you'll rind, 
No matter whether rich or poorly dressed. 
Then no matter where we go, from the highest to the low, 
From peasantry ' way up to kings or queens, 
Whatever we enjoy, theru's something to annoy, 
if we could only peep behind the scenes.

My grandfather's clock was too large for the shelf, 
So it stood ninety years on the floor; 
It was taller by half than the old man himself, 
Though it weighed not a 
pennyweight more. 
It was bought on the morn of the day that he was born, 
And was always his treasure and pride ; 
But it stopped short—never to go again— 
When the old man died. 
CHORUS. 
Ninety years, without slumbering, tick, tick, tick, tick, 
His life-seconds numbering, tick, tick, tick, tick, 
It stopped short—never to go again— 
When the old man died. 
In watching its pendulun swing to and fro, 
Many hours had he spent while a 
boy ; 
And in childhood and manhood the clock seemed to know, 
And to share both his grief and his joy, 
For it struck twenty-four when he entered at the door 
With a 
blooming and beautiful bride; 
But it stopped short— never to go again— 
When the old man died.

We marched behind the Branigan's band on the great St. 
Patrick's day, 
With liff.s and drums, a 
pht ng martial airs, 
From Ulster, Munster, Connaniara, you see we are on hand, 
To march with the music to the tune of the Branigan's band ; 
Oh! we marched so gaily down the street, 
And every one we meet says don't they step it neat ! 
We smile on all the girls we meet, 
While marching down behind the fatuous Branigan's band . 
CHORUS. 
Mark time, keep step, forward march away ! 
With eyes out, toes in, march in !2,-rand array, 
Shoulder arms, with head erect, together hand in hand. 
Like heroes bold, the young and old will march with the Bran-
igan's band. 
The chambermaids in the big hotels, they raise the windeys 
high, 
For handkerchiefs, they're waving towels, to catch our soldiers 
eyes; 
They've left their hash to cime out and mash, when the Mar-
shal gives command; 
Then we all raise our hats to the tune of the Branigan's band; 
Dh ! don't their hearts go pit-a- pat, 
As each one lifts his hat, the lean as well as fat, 
says there's my Dan, there goes my Pat, 
He's the daisy swell that's with the famous P,ranigan's band. 
Mark time, keep stop, & c. 
Oh, we had a 
ball in Emeeald Hall, and an illegant supper

There was beans and peas and fri ,,azees, and oysters fat for

With pickled stews, and hullabaloos, and Irish quail so grand; 
Beets and cheese, and some potheen for the boys of the Brani-
gans band; 
Oh ! it's then we sung, and danced a 
reel, 
And oh! how good we feel, we make the ladies squeal, 
So when morning comes it's home we steal, 
With the boys all drunk as lords, with the Branigan's band.

Oh! we've parted from each other, 
And our dream of love is o'er. 
That bright dream was too beautiful to last. 
And we'll meet as only strangers, 
In the future, evermore. 
Our once tender love is buried in the past. 
Tho' I've tried to bear the blow, 
Without sighs or bitter tears, 
And tried to smile when my heart ached with pain. 
Yet the burning tears would fall 
In spite of all that I 
could do. 
For the darling one I 
ne'er shall sec again. 
My dream of love is C;el°rTtus.

I 
try to smile when my heart aches with pain, 
But the memory of the past comes up before 
Me, like a

see again. 
Oh ! they say you love another, 
Who has claimed you for his bride. 
And you wish me to forgive and to forget, 
All the vows we pledged together 
By the rippling of the tide, 
As I 
looked into your beauteous eyes—my Pet. 
Ah the heart is like the tides 
That flow and ebb at will ; 
I 
would not cease to love thee if I 
could. 
So, thro' all the future years. 
I'll love the fondly, dearly, darling ! 
For I 
could not cease to love thee if I 
would.

THE FEN1ANS' ESCAPE. 
An original song of the escape of the Fenians' from Australia 
as written and sung by the great Irish Comedian and Vocalist. 
JAMES O'NEIL. 
NOW boys if you will listen, to the story I'll relate, 
I'll tell you of the noble men, who from the foe escaped. 
Though bound with Saxon fetters, in the dark Australian jail, 
They struck a 
blow for freedom, and for Yankee land set sail. 
On the 17th of April last, the stars and stripes did fly, 
On board the bark Catalpa, waving proudly to the sky. 
She showed the green above the red, as she did calmly lay, 
Prepared to take the Fenian boys, in safety o'er the sea. 
When Breslin and brave Desmond, brought the prisoners to the 
shore, 
They gave one shout for freedom, soon to bless them ever more 
And manned by gallant hearts they pulled towards the Yankee 
flag, 
For well they knew from its proud folds, no tryant could them. 
drag. 
They have nearly reached in safety the Catalpa, taut and trim, 
When fast approaching them they saw a 
vision dark and dim. 
It was the steamer " Georgette," and on her deck there stood, 
One hundred hired assassins, to shed each patriot's blood. 
The steamer reached the bounding bark, and fired across her 
bow, 
They in loud voice commanded, that the vessel should " Heave 
to." 
'but noble Captain Anthony, in thunder tones did cry, 
You dare not fire a 
shot at that bright flag, that floats on high. 
MY ship is sailing peacefully beneath that flag of stars, 
I'ts manned by Irish hearts of oak, and manly Yankee tars. 
And that dear emblem at the fore, so plain now to be seen, 
'Tis the banner I'll protect, old Ireland's flag of green. 
The Britisher he sailed away, from the stars and stripes he ran" 
He knew his chance was slim to fight, the boys of Uncle Sam, 
So Hogan, Wilson, Harrington with Darragh off did go, 
With Hassett and bold Cranston, soon to whip the Saxon foe. 
Here's luck to that noble captain, who well these men did free, 
lie dared the English- man-of-war, to fight him on the sea. 
And here's to that dear emblem. which in triumph shall be seen 
The flag for which those patriots fought, dear Irelands' flag of 
green. 
THE GEM THAT DECKS THE SEA. 
Written by H ARRY BENNETT for THE M URRAYS. 
Old Ireland's sons and daughters fair, 
They long to see her free; 
They love that little isle so green, 
That nestles on the sea. 
Adversity has been your fate, 
Your sons have had to emigrate, 
The day will come, if we but wait, 
When Ireland will be free. 
CHORUS. 
Erin, Erin, the gem that decks the sea, 
Erin, Erin, the home of mirth and glee. 
Your brave:sons, with stout hearts will fight for liberty ; 
Erin, Erin, we'll die to make you free. 
Prosperity and happiness, 
For Erin are in store, 
And all her sons, so brave and true, 
Will hasten to her shore. 
The turf fires they will brightly burn, 
The good old times they will return, 
Hibetnia's sons no more will yearn 
When Ireland she is free.

JOHN MITCHELL. 
As Sung by En. M URRAY. 
I 
am a 
true born Irishman, John Mitchell is my name. 
To free my own brave countrymen from Merry Town 1 
cil,rae 
I 
strugglled hard both night and day to tree my native land, 
For which I 
was transported, as you may understand. 
When first I 
joined my countrymen, 
was in 42, 
And then what followed after, 
quickiy tell to you 
I 
raised the standard of Repeal and gloried in the deed, 
And I 
vowed to Heaven I'd never rest until Erin it was 
freed. 
While here in prison, close confined, waiting for my trial 
day, 
My loving wife, she came to me, and these words to ima 
did say: 
Oh, John ! my dear, cheer up your heart, imd daunted do 
not be--
For it's better to die 1
,:lr Erin's rtghts than to 
Ave 
111 Slavery. 
When I 
received my sentence, ' twas on a 
foreign _,round, 
Where hundreds of my comrades assembled all around ; 
My liberty was offered me if their I 
would torsake their 
Cause ; 
But I'd rather die tcfn thousand deaths, than forsake my 
Irish boy-
Farewel ! My 
true born Irishmen—Fureweh ! my country 
too! 
But to leave my own poor babes behind, it grieves me 
worse than all; 
There is one request I 
ask of you, when your liberty you 
gain, 
Remember John Mitchell, far away, though a 
convict 
bound in chains.

BIDDIE DOYLE. 
The Lads Who Live in Ireland. 
As Sung by Jut. O'NEIL. 
Oh I 
I 
have conic over here, Biddie Doyle, 
For to tell you pretty clear, Biddle Doyle, 
For to gain your heart and Laud, 
As you will understand, 
And to be at your command, Biddie Doyle. 
So I 
will always prove true, 
No matter what you do, 
And I 
will stick to you like glue, Biddie Doyle. 
Oh! the summer is past and gone, Biddle Doyle, 
And the winter is coming on, Biddle Doyle; 
And' the stormy winds will blow, 
It will hail, rain and snow, 
And what will bome 
of you. Biddle Doyle. 
What will you do at all, 
When the suow begins to fall, 
With your back against the Nvall, Biddle Doyle. 
You know how it is yourself, Biddle Doyle, 
You will soon be on the shelf, Biddie Doyle; 
You know you are old enough, 
And your face is getting rou. h, 
Another year will make you tough, Biddle Doyle. 
So leave off your lamentation, 
And increase the population, 
Or you are not worthy of your nation, Biddie Doyle. 
Oh! when I 
go on a 
spree, Biddie Doyle, 
I 
will raise lots of fun, you'll see, Biddle Doyle ; 
If I 
should come home tight, 
Don't try to raise a 
fight, 
Or I'll give you a 
box that wil 1 
mate you quiet, Biddle Doyle; 
eon't call the neighbors around me. 
Or if you do, 1'11 surely pound you, 
And I 
will !: pit on you and drown you, Biddle Doyle.

OR, WHERE THE APPLE PR.ATIES GROW. 
As Sung by DAN NASH, the Great Character Artist. 
My name is Ned O'Manney, I 
was born in sweet Kilarney. 
I 
can fight, dance or sing, I 
can plow, reap or mow; 
And if I 
meet a 
pretty girl, I 
never practice blarney. 
I've something more alluring, which perhaps you'd like to know; 
I'm none of your Bulgrudderies, nor other sh,bby families, 
But can unto my pedigree a 
pretty title show; 
Oh I 
I'm of the O's and Macs, and likewise the sturdy Whacks. 
CHORUS. 
That live and toil in Ireland, where the Apple Praties grow; 
That live and toil in Ireland, where the Apple Praties grow, 
I 
could a 
deal relate, if I 
could but trace my pedigree : 
My Mother was a 
Hogan, but my Father I 
don't know; 
I've ninety-nine relations in a 
place they call Roscarberry. 
And each unto their name haea-Mac or an 0 ; 
My Uncle was a 
Brallaghan, my Aunt she was a 
Callaghan ; 
And as to my character, why, I 
can plainly show, 
I'm a 
rautin' rovin! blade, and I 
never was afraid, 
For I 
was born in Ireland, &e. 
May Hem en still protect our hospitable Country, 
Where first I 
drew my living breath, and heard its cocks to crow. 
Adieu to its green hills and its lovely Bay of Bantry! 
Where many a 
pleasant evening, my love and I 
did go. 
Where.shoals of fish, so pleasantly, did sport about so merrily, 
Beneath its glassy surface, their wanton tricks to s
-how, 
Oh I 
those scenes I 
did enjoy like a 
gay unthinking boy, 
With the lads who live in Ireland, & e. 
Ht. Patrick was our Saint, and a 
blessed man, in truth was he : 
Great gifts unto our Country he freely did bestow; 
He banished all the frogs and toads that sheltered in our Country, 
And unto other regions it's they were forced to go'; 
There is one tact undoubtedly, that cannot contradicted be ; 
For, trace the Irish history, and it will plainly show: 
Search the universe all round, tighter fellows can't be found, 
Than the lads who live in Ireland, & c.

That's the darlin' dear, 
Don't you cause any bother, 
Run out for a 
quart of beer. 
Don't go near the Dutchman's avick, 
You know he is a

But go around where it is cheaper and better, 
Go around to Teddy McGlynn. 
I've taken her over to Hoboken 
On many a 
Suimner's day, 
And there upon the Elysian 'Fields, 
Our figures we'd display, 
Hers was nate and trim, me boys, 
Three- fifty was her weight, 
She'd make me stand outside of the boat, 
For she wouldn't lit n 
a 
sate, 
Paddy come here to your mother, etc. 
In a 
snug retreat at Central Park, 
We wint one beautiful night, 
An' there we had a 
jug of the best, 
Both of us got tight. 
A 
policeman he came along, 
And the both of us took away. 
And next morning down at the Tombs 
Iliad both fines to pay. 
Paddy conic here to your mother, itc.

IT'S many years ago in Ireland, you must know, 
Since happiness looked down on our land, 
Our sons they then were free and the star of liberty, 
Shone gloriously on every Irishman. 
But let us bar the door on the;days that are no more, 
There's a 
light a

The sentiments of Pat ofMullingar.

Hurrah for Erin's Isle, though her sons you can beguile, 
Because they know the wolf is at the door, 
Yet may our nag lie seen aloft in College Green, 
And a 
Home Rule in Ireland evermore. 
In England they may boast that our Parliament is lost, 
And say that we never should complain; 
Would you have my heart be light when I 
know for this yam 
right, 
My countrymen are wishing o'er the main. 
Gladstone he may rave but our country for to save, 
These words they should be heard from shore to shore,

A Home Rule for Ireland for evermore.

There's one now in his grave wno struggled hard to .geve. 
Oar country from oppression long ago, 
Henry Grattan is his name and may Heaven be his )2f,ain, 
His energy on Ireland did bestow. 
His voice he never gave our people to enslave, 
Nor drive them to a 
far and distant shore, 
May the ilowerlets ever wave upon our hero's grave, 
And a 
Home Rule in Ireland for evermore. 
Chorus.—Hurrah for, &c. 
There'ri a 
laurel for the brow of the one who's striving now, 
To win our Legislature back again, 
John Martin, ever bold our misery to unfold, 
And Ireland for the Irish will maintain. 
But let us all unite to drink this toast to-night, 
May happiness revisit Erin's shore, 
And the plan of Isaac Butts, from the palace to the huts, 
Be a 
Home Rule for Ireland for evermore.

GOOD-BYE, BIDDY DEAR. 
As sung by JOHNNY ROACH. 
HERE I 
am an Irish boy, 
Who is always fond of mirth, 
And show me the crealure 
Who would slight me for my birth, 
And I 
have a 
neat coleen, 
In Dublin far behind,— 
I 
always was a 
broth of a 
boy, 
And my coleen she is blind. 
CHORU S. 
Good-bye, Biddy dear, 
It's hard to part from you, 
Although I 
am going to leave you, 
Me heart it will prove true, 
Then cheer me, vourneen, 
And don't look so forlorn, 
The harvest time is coming 
And I'm off to sheer the corn. 
I 
wouldn't have left Ireland, 
But times were hard, you know, 
To see the starving creatures, 
It would break the heart of stone, 
I 
bundled up icy kit, 
While Biddy wept and siglfd,

The Irishmen are out to-day, ad dressed up in tne style, 
With blooming shamrocks in their 
hats, and faces born 10 
smile; 
Old Erin's flag is hying with :
olutribus' starry gezn, 
And our friends are out to cheer and shout, to; the gallam: 
Irishmen. 
CHORUS. 
Then Irishmen tc the front, liurran! 
The Lte au drum we hear, 
With step so gay, we march away, 
While all the people cheer, 
The ladies too, with hearts so true, 
Applaud us now anc.- then, 
And on St Patrick's Jay they love to se: 
The gallant Irishmen. 
We march the street so graceful, with the marshal in advance, 
The band plays up an Irish tune, and it almost makes us dance. 
There's such delight, it brings us back to ould Ireland once 
again; 
With banners proudly floating o'er the gallant Ashmen. 
Then Irishmen, &c. 
At night we're ready to join the fun and take a 
social glass; 
We talk oi dear ould Ireland, the shamrock and the grass; 
We laugh and sing, and our feet we fling, liko Irishmen so true, 
And if there a light, why its our delight to show what we can 
- 
do. 
Then Irishmen, tte. 
Englishman, Scotchman, and Irishmanb 
As sung by TitomAs W INN Err. 
Englishman, Scotehman and Irishman were sentenced to death 
for stealing sheep, and Ins Honor the Judge informed them lie NVOIlld 
he very lenient with them, and give them their choice or dying, that is 
tiny could die according to their own nationality. 
So the first 10 
take the floor was the ENGLISHMAN, who sang as follows: 
Let me die on the oak. 
The brave old oak, 
That stands in the greenwood lawn, 
Let me die on the oak, 
The dear old oak. 
With its hundred of arms so strong, 
The next was the St:cm:Haw; who sang as follows: 
The moon's on the lake. 
And the mist on the g'en,. 
And. the glen that was known 
That is nameless by day, 
If their robbers by night, 
And pursue us with beagles, 
Give the flood to the rocks, 
And the fles:h to the sea-gulls. 
Then 110110 ! hollo ! hollo I 
Then Iloilo ! hollo ! 110110! 
While there's rope in oid Scotland, 
And a 
tree by the river, 
It's there let me die Judge, 
And hang there forever. 
Third and last was the IRISHMAN, who sang as follows: 
There's the Englishman and Seotchnian 
As you plainly see, 
have their own way of dying 
And that, you'll agree, - 
But I 
would be hung to a 
gooseberry tree, 
Before the daylight in the morning. 
But a 
goOsobery tree says the judge is too low 
To hang a 
man on it and that you all know, 
Then Pat-gave a 
wink to the Jury below, 
Saying, I'm in no hurry, 
ith, I'll wait till she grows. 
(And the tree never grew.)

It pleases both old and young. 
It is the Fac-simile of a

'An ingenious little book of the thaurnaturgic order, has been sent us ; 
called ' Humpry DII3aPTY.' and bound in such a 
way as to give opportu. 
nity for a 
decidedly puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary ap. 
pearance of a 
child's picture book, gaily printed and colored, it is Se, 
bound that a 
practised manipulator taking it up and flirting UV' leaVel 
over, can make it appear to be filled only with one picture, or with blank 
pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of figures. 
One minute the 
pamphlet, quickly thumbed, appears to contain nothing but the portrait 
of Harlequin, in his tesselated suit; the next only Columbine, then 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephistophiles. A 
little 
practice, and the directions printed with the book will make anybody 
at home in the handling of it."—M.

George Barnwell, THE AIEacnANT's CLERK. — This is an 
extremely sensational sketch, but shows Truth stranger than Fiction. 
This deluded victim went from crime to crime with a 
fearful rapidity, 
urged by the baneful influences of women lost to honor. 
He realized 
every moment the evils of his course, but, like a 
bird fluttering over the 
basilisk eye of the serpent, he went down, down., into the vortex of ruin 
and despair. 
This book teaches, in the strongest way, the moral lesson 
of resisting that temptation. which comes arrayed like an " angel of 
.light"--beautiful to the eye, and blasting to the soul.... Price 25 Cents.
