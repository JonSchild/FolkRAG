OPINIONS OF THE PRESS. 
M R. HARRY K ERNELL, in the North of Ireland dialect, his anecdotes, 
songs and dances, is an original piece of business, and has no successful 
imitator.— Louisville (Ky.) Paper. 
One of the really first-class features was the Irish dialect of Mr. Ker-
nell.—Chicago Evening Post. 
Harry Kernell introduces an entirely new feature in the variety busi-
ness, and merits the many encores he receives.—Minneapolis (Mo.) Paper. 
One of the greatest features of the entertainment Nvas Harry Kernel!, 
who sung, danced, and talked in the North of Ireland dialect until his au-
ditors were fairly aching at the sides from laughing. 
He retired timid 
much cheering.— Ottawa (Ca.) Paper. 
M R. H ARRY K ERNELI. MAKING MS OMCISANCg.—This gentleman is the 
most accomplished Irish comedian we have ever seen—having the brogue 
and accent to perfection, though he has never seen the " Dear little 
Isle." 
In fact, he takes pride in claiming another nationality. 
He kept 
the house in a 
continuous roar of laughter.— Montreal Canada. 
Last, not least, a 
new candidate for public favor has made a 
decided bit. 
Mr. Harry Kernell is a 
more than average representative of the rare North 
of Ireland comedian; and dances better than any of the leading men in 
his line.—Ciacianati Enquirer. 
Harry Kernell, who sings, dances, and talks in the North of Ireland dia-
lect, ia very funny.—Baltintore Paper. 
Harry Kernell is original, and everybody liked him,— Washingion Paper. 
Mr. Harry Kernell is the best stage Irishman we have ever seen. 
ills 
ebulitions of humor seem to be the natural overflow of a 
joyous spirit, and 
not the studied gags so common to the stage, to laugh at which requires a 
painful effort on the part of the hearer. We have often sat and witnessed 
attempted portrayals of the characteristics ot d 
ff,2rent nations, and have 
felt in duty bound to laugh. We went to be amused, and felt that the 
privilege of laughing was included in the price of admission ; but every 
muscle in our face was pained in the effort to fulfill our obligation. 
In 
witnessing Kernell's Irish Comicalities, the inclination to laughter was 
spontaneous and irresistible, and the only pain we experienced was in the 
endeavor to control our risibilities.—Phila. Sunday Mercury, May 10, 1875. 
But next to Tony Pastor, Mr. Harry Kernell—a North of lreiand come-
dian— provoked more mirth and immoderate laughter than any of his fel-
low performers. He has the accent beautifully, imitates the actions of his 
subject well, and rolls out an immense volume of witty sayings. — 0(tawu 
((Ja.) Paper. 
Harry Kernell, in his ten minutes of fun and laughter, made the audience 
roar.— Toronto, ( Ca.) Paper. 
Mr. Harry Kernel!, Negro comedian, made his first appearance, and made 
a 
decided hit. 
He is equal to any in his line of specialties that ever ap-
peared here. His dialect imitations of the old darkey at cainp-meeting were 
perfection, and brought down the house.—Syraruse Standard. 
Harry Kernel! is the favorite of the troupe, receiving round after round 
of applause as he goes through his songs, dances, and imitations.—Pitt
burgh Evening Leader. 
Mr. Harry Kernell was particularly well received, his Irish character 
sketches convulsing the audience with laughter, and bringing down the 
r i 
house in storms o applause. 
Ile is the best n 
his line ever seen in Balti-
more.—Ballimore Evening News. 
Harry Kernel! proved himself a splendid Irish comedian, and a 
fine 
dancer.— Cincinnati Enquirer. 
Tony Pastor, Gus Williams, and Harry Kernell, are the big favorites of 
the audience.—Phila. Evening Item, Aug. 27, 1875. 
Harry Kernell is as comical in his sketches as it is possible to be.—Beston 
Post. 
But one of all who took down the house, was Harry Kernel], in North of 
Ireland talking and singing. 
His make up, dialect, and action we 
true 
to the life, and one of the most droll characterizations we have ever wit-
nessed.—Meriden ((Jonn.) Standard. 
Harry Kernell should devote himself entirely to Irish characters ; there 
is no finer stage Irishman in the variety business than he.—PitIsbargh 
Evening Leader. 
CLARENCE M cGOWAN - S TROUBLES . 
R.-" Sold Everywhere." 
Sung by HARRY KERNELL. 
IIEnr: I 
am, an Irishman, 
From Ireland I 
came ; 
I 
landed in America, 
And here I 
will remain. 
I 
had to struggle hard at first, 
And I 
don't think it was fair— 
No matter what I 
tried to do, 
I 
was sold everywhere. 
SPOKEN.--No 
matter what I 
tried to do, I 
couldn't get along. 
once opened a 
cheap music store ; a 
fellow came in one day 
and asked far a 
ballad called " Act on the Square, Boys ;" and 
I 
turned my back to him to get it, when he stole a four dollar 
fiddle, and ran out. 
I 
took my girl to a 
party once, and at the 
supper table I 
asked her if she liked cod-tiOi balls P She said 
she didn't, nor she never attended one. But it's the same story, 
I 
was— 
CHORUS. 
Sold, sold, everywhere, 
Alas ! I 
have been sold ; 
Sold here, sold there, 
The half has not been told. 
Sold right, sold left— 
It ain't no use to try. 
No matter what I 
try to do, 
I 
am sold everywhere. 
I 
went out once to a 
menagerie, 
To see the animals jump ; 
When a 
monkey came bouncing out of a 
cage 
And (rave me an awful thump. 
I 
immediately grabbed him by the tail, 
ills tail it then came loose ; 
And a 
little boy was standing by, 
Said, 
Glue it on, you uoose!" 
SPOKEN.—I 
couldn't glue it en. and I 
was arrested for cruelty 
to orphans. 
I 
worked for a 
man once— the meanest man I 
ever 
saw. 
He was so mean, he used to talk through his nose ; afraid 
of wearing his month out. 
He was so mean, he got married on 
tick ; and he has been living on tick ever since. 
He got on a 
steamboat once, and when the captain came around to collect 
the fare, lie jumped overboard. He walked ashore in fifteen feet 
of water. 
He was such a 
sponger he drew the water all up, and 
walked clean ashore. 
Once he hired two Chinamen to blast 
CLARENCE McGOWAN'S TROUBLES.—Con-
eluded. 
rocks. 
They put. in too much powder, and the rocks blasted 
them fifteen feet up in the air. 
When they came down, he took 
it out of their wages for the time that they were up. 
Sold, sold, etc. 
Wherever I 
go, I 
am bound 
To pluck misfortune's bitter fruits ; 
And find myself sold everywhere, 
Except about the boots. 
Come, Fortune, turn your wheel again, 
And be a 
little fair; 
And give a 
good turn for one 
Who's been sold everywhere. 
Sold, sold, etc.

SONG AND DANCE. 
Air..—" Martha Jane Barew." 
Written for EARRY KERNELL by E. McCuany. 
THERE was a 
man named Pat McCann, 
He courted a 
girl named Mary Ann, 
lie loved her very dearly, yes, he loved her as his life, 
l 
le dressed so gay on Patrick's day— 
He popped the question right away— 
And asked this little darling if she would be his wife; 
Oh, to cry then she began right before this handsome man ; 
" 
Arrah," says she, " you're the biggest blarney 
I 
met in all my life," said Mary Ann to Pat McCann ; 
" 
Go away from me, you naughty man, 
Or else I 
will tell my mother, and she'll surely have your life." 
CHORUS. 
Oh, handsome Pat McCann loved his purty Mary Ann, 
Every evening he would take her out a- walking, 
Ile would buy her an oyster stew and molasses candy, 
And the way he used to kiss her was so shocking. 
Said Pat McCann to Mary Ann, " You are my darling jewel, 
And if von will not accept in,. hand 
go and end my life." 
Said Mary Ann to Pat McCahn, 
" 
I 
love you more than ,any man, 
And rather than refuse your hand I'll be your lovinr, wife." 
It, he bought her then the ring, 
And many another pnrty thing; he bought her silks and satins 
Enough to last her life; and although it was Lent 
To church they went to ask the father 
For his consent to marry this loving couple, 
And make them man and wife. 
Oh, handsome Pat, etc. 
Now Pat McCann and Mary Ann 
Are as happy as salt water clanis ; 
The divil a 
couple in all the land 
With hearts so full of joy, for some time last spring 
A 
little thing dropped in one day to hear Pat sing, 
it's nice to be the flther of a 
bouncing baby boy ; 
Now they're like turtle doves, 
They are happy in their loves, 
All cares and sorrows are unknown, all troubles they defy ; 
I 
wish my name wa-: Pat McCann, 
You would be my Mary Ann ; 
I 
would hug and kiss you, darling, a/1 le niarriel by ;: nd by. 
Oh, handso:ne Pat, etc. 
THE O 'SHAUGHNESSY GUARDS. 
Written by W ILLIAM W ELCH. 
As sung by MISS ADAH RICHMOND and HARRY KERNELL. 
Two brave boys in our new uniform, 
Proud are we when we shoulder our guns; 
We see flags and banners floating, 
As we go marching down Broadway. 
Then right face about. (Symp.) 
CHORUS. 
Then we hear the drums a-beating, 
And the music sweetly play, 
As we go marching, down Broadway 
Upon St. Patrick's day-ay-ay! 
We are out on a 
parade do you see, 
Cousin Mike and me— 
We'll march away, we'll march all day, 
Come and join our company. 
The beautiful girls all throng the sidewalk, 
And wave their hands to our company; 
They always throw us wreaths and bouquets, 
And give three cheers for Biddy and I. 
Then right face about. 
Then we hear, etc. 
Now come, all young men, that's fond of fighting, 
And roll your names in our company; 
All sorrows and woes we'll send a- kiting, 
And fight for fun and liberty. 
Then we hear, ete.

WHY DON'T YOU H IRE A H ALL 
By 
GEORGE S. 
KNIGHT. 
CAME out here when very small, 
The 0102 I 
don't know when,— 
At first I 
did not know so much, 
But I'm smarter now than then ; 
I 
keep a 
liquor store down town, 
Where all the boys did meet, 
And the funny things to me they said 
To you now I'll repeat. 
CHORUS. 
Why don't you hire a 
hall ? 
Oh, say go shoot that hat— 
I 
commence to think you are too fresh; 
Go jump in some salt vat,— 
Don't talk us all to death; 
Oh, tumble, do now, Ned,— 
Cheese it now— give us a 
rest— 
Swim out, you're over your head. 
I 
soon commenced to see and know 
What everything they meant, 
And that the business didn't pay, 
I 
couldn't make a 
cent ; 
So then I 
put my foot right down, 
I 
likewise told my clerk 
To tell them fellows when they'd come 
That business wouldn't work. 
Why don't you, etc. 
THE ORIGIN OF IRELAND. 
COMIC RECITATION. 
Wrrn due condescension I'd call your attention 
To what I 
shall mention of Erin so green, 
And without hesitation CH show how that nation 
Became of creation the gem and the queen. 
'T was early one morning without any warning 
That -Warms was born hi the beautiful sea, 
An] by the same token and sure ' twas provoking, 
Iler pinions were soaking and wouldn't give play. 
Old Neptune, who knew her, began to pursue her, 
In order to woo her— the wicked old Jew— 
A 
il almost had caught her, a 
top of the water, 
Great Jupiter's daughter, which never would do. 
But Jove, the great Janus, looked down and saw Vanus, 
And Neptune so hainous pursuing her wild, 
And he spoke out in thunder, he'd rend him asunder, 
And sure ' twas no wonder for chasing his child. 
A 
star that was flying hard by him espying, 
He caught with small trying, and down let it snap ; 
It fell quick as winking on Neptune a- sinking, 
And gave him I'm thinking a 
bit of a 
rap. 
That star it was dry land, both lowland and highland, 
And formed a 
sweet island the lawd of my birth; 
Thus plain is the story, that sent clown from glory, 
Old Erin asthore is the gem of the earth. 
Upon Erin nately jumped Vanus so stately, 
But fainted kase lately so hard she was pressed, 
Which much did bewilder, but ere it had killed her, 
Her father distilled her a 
drop of the best. 
That sup was .victorious, it made her feel glorious, 
A 
little uproarious I 
fear it might prove ; 
So how can you blame us that Ireland's so famous 
For drinking and beauty, for fighting and love.

JAR DOWN EVERYBODY. 
End song, sung by HARRY KERNELL. 
I 
sew a 
jay bird on a 
limb, 
I 
turned around and winked at him, 
I 
took my gun and aimed at him, 
Shot him in de lea, left de marrow on de limb. 
EROEUS (Repeat.) 
Over in de Monegeholo, 
Over in de Alief,alinny, 
Jar down everybody, everybody jar down, 
Jar down every body, jar, jar, jar down. 
I 
had a 
horse, his name was Jack, 
I 
rode his tail to save his back ; 
Oh, how that horse would rear and kick, 
I 
coaxed him along with a 
hickory stick. 
Over in de Monegeholo, etc.

Went down to the riber to shoot some crows,

Sung by HARRY KERNELL. 
I Am so glad, I 
am so glad, 
When the old ship Zion was passing by. 
I 
am so glad, oh, you will land on de Canaan shore! 
You rise up in de morning, 
And you look up yonder in de sky ; 
And dere you see the eagle's nest, 
And yar de young ones cry ; 
I 
am so glad you git to glory by-and-by. 
If you get over to Jordan, 
And you don't see me over dar ; 
Send me a 
ring for a 
token of your love, 
Likewise a 
lock of your hair. 
I 
look way over yonder. 
And what you ' spect I 
see 7 
A great big angel on de boom of a 
ship, 
A 
beckoning along to me. 
I 
am so glad, 
You get to Jordan by-and-by!

cap, which, can be easily 
removed, may complete his attire.]

When Pat comes over the bill, his colleen for to see, 
His whistle, loud and shrill, the signal was to be. 
"

Mary I " my mother cries, " there's somebody whistling, 
sure." 
"No, mother, its only the wind, that's whistling through the 
door, 
That's whistling through the door." 
[PAT, outside, whistles " Garry Owen."] 
M ARY (
listening).—Oh, that's the clear boy. 
Now if I 
only 
can keep him here unbeknown to my mother. 
[Enter the MOTHER, with a 
crutch.] 
MOTHER.—Mary dear. 
Mary, I 
say. 
Where are you ? 
MARY.—Here, mother dear. 
What is it you're after want-
ing with me? 
MOTHER.—Didn't I 
hear somebody whistling, Mary ? 
MARY.—Sure, it was the wind, mother. 
M OTHER sings. 
I've lived a 
long time, Mary, in this wide world, my dear; 
But the wind to whistle a 
tune like that I 
never before did 
hear. 
MARY sings. 
But, mother, you know the fiddle hangs just behind the 
chink, 
And the wind upon the strings of it is playing a 
tune, I 
think ; 
Is playing a 
tune, I 
think.

THE WHISTLING THIEF.—[CoNriNuEn.] 
[PAT, outside, barks like a 
dog.] 
MOTHER sings. 
The dog is barking now, and a 
fiddle can't play a 
tune. 
MARY sings. 
But, mother, you know that dogs will bark when they see 
the moon. 
MOTHER sings. 
But how can he see the moon, when you know he's old and 
blind; 
Blind doers can't see the moon, nor fiddles be played by the 
wind, 
Nor fiddles be played by the wind. 
[PAT, outside, imitates a 
pig.] 
MOTHER sings. 
And there now is the pig, oneasy in his mind. 
MARY sing. 
But, mother, you know the saying, that pigs can see the 
wind. 
MOTHER sings. 
That's all very well in the day, but allow me, miss, to re-
mark 
That pigs, no more than ourselves, can see anything in the 
dark, 
Can see anything in the dark.

Darlint, are 
you there ? 
MARY.—Yes, Pat; but be aisy, me mother is wide awake. 
PAT.—Oh, bad luck to her—I

MARY.—Oh, I

If she does, sure she'll

PAT.—What do you suppose I'd care for that ? 
MARY.—Don't come whistling round the door any more, 
Pat. 
You ought to know better. 
PAT.—Sure, I'll whistle now if you don't stop me mouth

THE WHISTLING THIEF.--[CoNTINur.D.] 
PAT sings. 
Now, boys, don't courting go too near to the house, d'ye mind; 
Unless you're certain sure the old woman's both deaf and 
blind; 
The days when they were young, forget they never can, 
They're able to tell the difference ' twixt a 
fiddle, pig, dog 
and a 
man; 
A

THE BOULEVARD. 
A POPULAR IRISH SONG . 
The Music of this song is published by E. II. H ARDING, 229 Bowa-r, New 
York. 
Price 10 cents. 
As sung by JOHN Roam. 
GOOD evening to you, one and all, 
You're looking well I 
see ; 
I 
took a 
trip in a 
great big ship 
Acrooss the raging sea ; 
I've been out of work a 
month or more, 
And you know it's very hard; 
But now I've got a 
job to do 
Beyant on the. Boulevard. 
Whist I 
ad id- y ! whist I 
ad-i-d-y! 
Times are very hard, 
But now I've got a 
job to do 
Beyant on the Boulevard. 
So here I 
am, an Irishman, 
And to work I'm not afraid; 
While my son does carry the pick, my boys 
And I 
do handle the spade; 
My Uncle Dan is an Alderman, 
And he holds a 
grip in the ward ; 
'Tis him that (-rives the tickets out 
To work on the Boulevard. 
Whist I 
ad-i-dy! etc. 
So now farewell, I'm going away, 
I 
can no longer stay ; 
For if I 
sing any more for you 
I'll lose a 
half a 
day ; 
I'm going down to the City Hall, 
To try and get a 
card 
To put my father's uncle to work 
Beyant on the Boulevard. 
Whist I ! 
etc. 
" 
I'M WHAT YOU CALL A MILITARY MAN !" 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1874, by E. H. HAnnrNo, 
in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, Washington, D. C. 
The Music of this song is published by E. H. H ARDING, 288 Bowery, New 
York. 
Price 10 cents. 
Writtea and Composed by GEO. H. HART. 
I'm what you call a 
military man, 
If you doubt me, I 
will prove it, for I 
can. 
I 
stand just six foot two, " sans " a 
stocking or a 
shoe, 
And a 
finer soldier you will never scan. 
CHOP.US. 
To a " right shoulder shift," my musket I 
will lift, 
And all the pretty faces I 
will scan, oh, 
When the band does sweetly play, we will march, march away, 
For I'm what you call a 
military man. 
Whenever I 
go out upon parade, 
I 
awaken in the breast of every maid, 
A 
feeling they admire, for I 
set their heart on fire, 
And of military men, they're not afraid. 
To a " right shoulder shift," etc. 
When they see me marching proudly down Broadway, 
They look at one another, and they say, 
" 
Oh, what a 
splendid man, just look at him, Mary Ann, 
I 
can't resist his military way." 
To a " right shoulder shift," etc. 
Where'ere I 
go I 
greatly am admired, 
And with such martial feeling I'm inspired, 
That the ladies all assert that with me they'd rather flirt, 
For of military men they're never tired. 
To a " right shoulder shift," etc.

THE FLANNEL MOUTH MICK. 
Written by W ILLIAM W ELCH of Simmons and Slocum's Minstrels. 
I 
KNow you'll have pity 
When you hear what I 
say— 
The way I 
have been treated 
By the blackguards each day, 
Who stand on the corners, 
As I 
pass them by, 
You can hear them say plainly, 
Arrah, " stag the old guy." 
Oh, they yell out, " You terrier, 
Go shoot that hat quick !" 
They call me a 
chow and 
A 
flannel mouth mick. 
The other day while a-walking 
I 
went down the street, 
A charming young damsel 
By chance I 
did meet; 
Says I, " You look charming, 
Ah, cushla ma vick ;" 
Says she, " Drop on yourself, 
You flannel mouth tnick." 
Oh, they yell out, etc. 
When election day comes, 
I 
know what they'll say— 
" 
How are you, Mr. McGuinness, 
how are you 1 
good day." 
They'll hand me a 
ticket, 
Say, " Go vote it, now quick—" 
I'm a 
gentleman then, 
And no flannel mouth mick. 
Oh, they yell out, etc. 
KALAIVIAZACK. 
SHE'S gone to join the circus, 
She's an actor in the ring, 
She's teaching the elephant how to dance, 
And the hip-po-po-tamus to sing; 
I 
know I'll never see her more, 
She's travelling now by rail, 
She's getting ten dollars a 
day, my boys, 
For scrubbing the monkey's tail. 
CHORUS . 
For she is my morning glory, 
And I 
wish she would come back ; 
I'd buy her a 
bran new pair of socks, 
Likewise a 
summer straw hat, 
A pound of cheese, a 
barrel of fleas; 
l'd ride her out in a 
hack, 
My beautiful, sweet Elizabeth, 
From the town of Kalamazack. 
When first we was acquainted 
She was with the soap- fat man, 
She was chewing glue for Miss Barue, 
Who keeps a 
peanut stand; 
But now she's getting wealthy, 
She has left me here forlorn; 
I 
hope she'll die or get rammed in the eye, 
With a 
rack-o-ri-nuses' horn. 
For she is, etc. 
I 
can't live any longer 
Unless she does return; 
I'll swallow a 
stool or a 
three-legged mule, 
Or I'll cut off my head with a 
churn. 
And if that doesn't kill nie, 
Myself I'll tie in a 
sack— 
I'll jump in the river and take a 
bath, 
For my Lizzie of Kalamazack. 
For she is, etc.

ALDERMAN FLYNN. 
Written by GEORGE THATCHER, the great Ethiopian Comedian. 
I 
GUESS you have heard of fighting, (Symp.) 
Now, that's what I 
delight in ; (Symp.) 
As I 
go down the street, boys, 
With my sword drawn in my hand, 
I 
march to the tune of the Mulligan Guards, 
As played by the Irish band. 
CHORUS. 
There's Alderman Flynn, what do you think of him 3 
lie is elected now by a 
thousand solid men ; 
And the boys all shout when I 
turn out. 
Hurrah, for Alderman Flynn ! 
I 
am pet,of all the ladies, (Symp.) 
I 
am fond of all the babies; (Symp.) 
My appearance is engaging— 
It is upon my word. 
I 
expect to be a 
solid man 
Over all the wards. 
There's Alderman Flynn, etc. 
I 
thought I'd go to the army, (Symp.) 
I 
thought the bullets wouldn't harm me ; 
I 
went to go to the rear one day, for to get cup of tea, 
When a 
cannon ball come. 
And hit me in the thumb, 
And knocked the leg off me. 
SPOKEN. — When I 
came home a 
wounded hero it was differ-

They wanted me to grind an organ on the corners; they 
said one good turn deserves another, and now the boys say 
when they see me—

That hat he wears Las bcen called in; 
.And they all do shout when I

THE LABORING MAN. 
Written by GEORGE THATCHER. 
MY 
name it is Pat Connors, 
I 
am happy as you can see., 
I 
was born in Cork in Ireland, 
That emerald of the sea ; 
I 
left my native country, 
My dear old native sod, 
And earned an honest living here 
By carrying the hod. 
CHORUS . 
So gaze upon me, while I'm here, 
I 
will do the best I 
can,— 
My motives are pure, alihough I 
am poor. 
And only a 
laboring man. 
When I 
came to this country 
A 
dollar a 
day was good, 
But now if a 
man gets two and half 
It. will scarcely buy him food ; 
But I 
will struggle throuTh the worl 1. 
And do the best I 
can— 
Ill stick to politics, and some day 
I'll be an alderman.

MRS . CASEY'S RAFFLE. 
Written and sung by B ARRY K ERNELL. 
IF 
you listen to me for awhile 
IR tell you a 
tale ; 
You all know Mrs. Casey, down 
The street, that sells the ale. 
She gave a 
raffle for a 
stove, 
And to have a 
dance as well; 
And I 
being the floor manager, 
had tickets for to sell. 
SPOKEN.—Mrs. Casey is a 
particular friend of John McSwe- • 
gall, and a 
full cousin of William Waterhouse ; and her husband 
Sam 0-Casey, alias Gas House Sam—( he was once employed in 
the Gas House at sixty dollars a 
month, wheeling smoke out in 
a 
push- cart)—he went to the war as a 
soldier, and never re-
turned, and Mrs. Casey raffled off the old stove. 
CHORUS. 
But oh, what a 
row ! I 
will tell it to you now ! 
Breaking heads, with slats of the beds ; 
McGatlin fainted, I 
thought he was dead, 
O'Brien lost his hat, what do you think of that 1 
Mrs. O'Leary lost her hoops at Casey's raffle ! 
Now, in came John McIntee, 
Along with Rodger Dunbar ; 
When up jumped O'Brien, the fiddler, 
And says, this is going too far. 
But before he had time to open his month, 
He was lying on the floor ; 
And I 
like a 
fighting man, 
Busted through the door. 
SPOKEN.—Begorra, I never saw such a 
fracas in my born 
days before. 
Whin they knocked O'Brien down, he bawled out 
for Nixey, and cheese it ; and they came in with billy-jacks, and 
knocked every body down that came in reach of them. 
And 
Nancy McGowan got excited and jumped clear out of a 
pull-
back dress. 
But oh ! what a 
row, etc. 
The raffling then did commence, 
As you may understand; 
McGtiflin threw forty-four, 
And O'Donnell called his hand. 
But, Mrs. Casey got vexed then, 
And ordered thin, all out ; 
When the tiddler played Patrick's day, 
Then you had ought to hear them shout. 
MRS. CASEY'S RAFFLE.—Concluded. 
SpoKEN.—Such shouting you never heard in your life ; but 
when the supper was announced, everything became quiet. 
They had a 
splendid supper. 
There was mackerel and ice-
cream, and molasses and oysters. 
John Bradley went to wait 
on the ladies. 
lie asked one girl v. hat she would have 1 Says 
she, " I 
will have quail." 
Says John. " You will have bean 
soup, or you will give your seat to Biddy Doyle." 
Another 
young girl wanted an egg dropped on toast ; says John, " You 
will get some old hen to drop it, or you will not get it here to-
night." 
Then Bermidas Conklin wanted to make a speech. 
Says he, " Would I 
were an eagle, that I 
might fly over the sea 
and spread the liberty of my country !" 
Says Jim Kelly, " Sit 
down ; you would be shot for a 
goose before you got half way." 
But it was— 
But oh! what a 
row, etc. 
THERE'S A BOTTLE ON THE MANTLE. 
Ant.—" Letter in the Candle." 
THERE'S a 
bottle on the mantle, 
But it don't belong to me ; 
If I 
could only smell the flavor, 
How happy I 
would be. 
But I 
dare not approach it, 
For fear some one would come in; 
But I 
would like to take a 
snifter, 
For I 
know it's full of gin. 
Small drop of gin, 
To wet my fiery tongue; 
I 
loved you since my childhood, 
Many songs of you I 
have sung. 
Oh ! how sadly I 
remember, 
it was two short months ago ; 
I 
had a 
bully lunch route, 
But they took me down below. 
They said I 
was a 
vagarant— 
And I 
think it was a 
sin 
To lock me in a 
dungeon, 
And deprive me of my gin. 
Small drop of gin. etc.

I 
was leader in mischief at school, 
Though always so humble and meek; 
And when I 
discovered a 
chance of reward, 
I 
was always informer and sneak. 
By the evil example I 
set, 
Other boys into mischief were led; 
But I 
always managed to pocket the spoil, 
And get other boys wolloped iustead.—Cno. 
When a 
man I 
went into the world, 
I 
plundered the helpless and poor; 
Yet always got off with a

IRISH BLADES . 
Sung by M URPHY and M ORTON. 
W E'RE two roving blades from old Killarney. 
And the pretty colleens call us bouncing Barneys ; 
We're the Irish boys can tip to them the blarney, 
And dear old Paddy's Land, that's our home, do you mind ; 
Just a 
few years ago we took a 
notion 
For to take a 
trip across the briny ocean; 
Our hearts were all in a 
commotion, 
Since we left that little isle so far away, do you mind. 
CHORUS. 
For we are ever bright and gay, singing, dancing all the day, 
This caubeen of a 
hat we're ever wearing, 
Although we are from our homes afar, 
Our hearts are ever there; 
No land we'll ever see can ever wean 
Our love from dear old Ireland. 
When we landed in Columbia's nation, 
Among the girls we caused a 
great sensation; 
We're the happiest Irish pair that's in the nation, 
And dear old Paddy's land that's our home, do you mind; 
When at night the bright eyes are glancing, 
For the colleens fair you will always see us dancing, 
We are two Irish boys that's always fond of prancing, 
And to please you sure that is our aim. 
For we are, etc.

PARADE OF THE A . 
0. II. 
Written for H ARRY K ERNELL by G. A. McCunnY. 
A IR—" Connemara Coockoos." 
I'M a 
gay young chap from Erin and they call me Dandy Pat, 
I 
wear a 
green regalia, a 
harp, and shamrock in my hat; 
I 
joined the Ancient Order; we're the boys that looked so gay 
When we marched in the procession on last St. Patrick's day, 
And oh, such music, such music, such mu.zic as we had all day, 
such music, such music, how sweet the bands did play. 
MIA Maainnis was chief marshal and he rode a 
fine white horse, 
With a 
sword and sash beside him, oh! boys he was the boss! 
With a 
smile on every feature, and a 
uniform so gay, 
The ladies all smiled on him as we marched alone the way, 
And oh, such winking, such winking, such winking as was 
there that day, 
Such winking, such winking, they winked the livelong day. 
'Twas just below the common we fell into the line, 
With flags and banners flying, the day being nice and fine, 
The band played Garry Owen and then the Mulligan Guard ; 
And we carried the harp of Erin beside the stripes and stars. 
And oh, such tramping, such tramping, such tramping as was 
there that day, 
Such tramping, such tramping all through the mud and clay. 
When we marched in open order faith ' twould make you laugh 
to see 
The little stick lee cripple keeping step with Mick Magee ; 
When we come before the marshal's house they brought us to 
a 
halt, 
And they gave us just ten minutes for to go and (-ret our malt. 
And oh. such whiskey, such whiskey, such whiskey as was 
drank that day, 
Such whiskey, such whiskey, the bar- rooms made it pay. 
Then when we were disbanded as quick as you could wink 
We all bounced down to Kelley's for to have a 
drop to drink, 
The whiskey punch dew lively for the liquor was so rare, 
In less than fifteen minutes divil a 
sober man was there. 
And oh, such drinking, such drinking, such drinking as was 
there that night, 
Such drinkina, such drinking, the boys got awful tight. 
Mike Connors and Pat Cronin then (-Jot into a 
dispute, 
Mike said his hat was finest, and Pat slapped him on the snoot, 
Then broken heads were plenty, the blood ran freely there, 
My!- elf and long Dan Carty had to waltz off on our ear. 
And oh. such flJitini. such fighting, such fighting as the boys 
had there. 
Such 11 ,1itine. such fihtiu2, ' twas like an

THE FUNNY LITTLE TAILOR. 
Composed and sung by PAT BELLY. 
THERE was a 
jolly tailor once that I 
knew well, 
He kept a 
little tailor shop and had pantaloons to sell, 
Neck- ties, broadcloth, and everything like that, 
And anyone could tell he wore a 
very funny hat; 
It wasn't very low nor it wasn't very high, 
It had a 
peculiar look that would quickly take the eye. 
He wore it on Sunday and every day in the week, 
And it always looked glossy, for he kept it very neat. 
He was the pride of the ladies and the envy of the boys; 
Wherever he would go he would never make a 
noise ; 
He was as light on his feet as a 
canary on a 
tree; 
He was bashful, he was neat, and as happy ag could be ; 
Whenever there was a 
party he was sure to be there, 
With his tight pantaloons and glossy curly hair; 
He could talk, dance, sing, and wink, and everything like that, 
But no matter where he would go he wore his funny little hat. 
He went to a 
party one night where there was lots of fun, 
He got rather tired and sleepy from drinking rum and gum ! 
They put him in the corner to have a 
little doze, 
When the boys found it out they put a 
cork on his nose, 
And they all yelled " Fire!" with a 
terrible shout; 
But he quickly jumped up and quietly put it out ; 
He took his little hat and walked to the door, 
And he bade them all good-bye, and they never saw him more.

JUST LANDED. 
AIR.—" I 
Couldn't Stay Away." 
W E 
came from Connemara 
A few short months ago, 
With spirits light and airy, 
Two emigrants, you know ; 
Pray let us ask your pardon, 
Smile on us if you choose, 
We come to Castle Garden, 
We're the two Irish cuckoos. 
CHORUS. 
For we've just landed, just landed, 
We landed over there, you know; 
We've landed, just landed, 
We're the two Irish cuckoos. 
Cutting turf was our occupation 
In the bogs of Allen then ; 
But they say that in this nation 
Well at least be aldermen ; 
We'll run for big positions 
In offices of note, 
We'll join the politicians. 
And of course for us you'll vote. 
For tve've just, etc. 
When we go back to Ireland, 
Sure, then it will be said 
Well raise up in our sire- land 
The green above the red; 
Then all this world will glory 
W 
bene'er they hear the news 
Of Ireland and the story of 
The two Irish cuckoos. 
For we're just, etc.

THE RISING POLITICIAN. 
Written and sung by HARRY BENNETT. 
G. on evening to ye all, 
I've come to make a 
call, 
And tell ye of my victory 
Upon election day. 
I 
ran for alderman, 
And Murphy was the man 
Who tried hard to defeat me, 
But he gave himself away ; 
He never tried repeatin', 
And that's the way I 
beat him— 
I 
voted seven times myself 
In the mild Fourth Ward so gay. 
cnonus. 
Now I'm a 
politician, 
I 
hold a 
high position 
I 
gained by repetition 
"Upon election day. 
I 
took the gang around 
Where the free lunch could be found, 
And many s 
the plate of soup, my boys, 
Did they put out of sight ; 
We swept the district clean, 
And the divil such a 
scene 
Was known in New York city, boys, 
Upon election night; 
Cigar signs, barrels, boards we burned 
When the victory it was earned 
It gave me satisfaction and 
It filled me wid delight. 
Now I'm a 
pol:tician, etc. 
And DOW I'll tell to you 
What I 
am going to do ; 
ill not forget the workingmen, 
To them I 
will be true : 
They shall have eight hours a 
day, 
And a 
fair amount of pay. 
And live as well as those big bugs 
upon Fifth Avenue 
Sure 
improve the city, 
For I 
think it is a 
pity 
That poor men should be starving 
When there's public work to do. 
CHORE'S. 
So let ye all be merry, 
And don't ye vote contrary. 
And I 
will show ye, one and all, 
What an Irishman can do. 
DUBLIN POLICEMEN. 
W E. RE rattling., 
roaring Irish boys, 
Come over here to join the force, man ; 
To protect the peace, keep down the noise, 
There's none can do it like us, of course, man; 
In our suit of blue there are but few 
With us can come the Irish dandy, 
And if the boys kick up any noise, 
Sure we run them into the cell quite handy.

We're a

There's not a

About the town but what we scale it, 
And if anything there we find at all, 
Wouldn't we be flats if we didn't nail it 1 
Next day there is a 
hue and cry. 
Something stole, but to be brief, man, 
And by the hookey, who but ourselves 
Is running about to cotch the thief, man ! 
Tearing away, etc. 
Supposing, walking about all night, 
In every hole and corner creeping, 
Something we spy by the pale moonlight; 
Arrah. by my soul, it's a 
gintleman sleeping, 
his pockets we g.rope, his money we take, 
Then with our sticks on the ribs we're jobbing him, 
And if perchance the poor soul should wake, 
We tell him we thought a 
thief was robbing him. 
Tearing away, etc.

A TWO -CENT SAIL. 
Written and sung by litany BENNETT. 
THE other night, while feeling bright, 
I 
thought I'd have a 
racket ; 
The thought itself was good enough, 
But I'd no stamps to back it. 
I 
went to take a 
two- cent sail, 
To keep my spirits merry, 
But now I 
wish that I 
had died 
Before I 
crossed the ferry. 
CHORUS. 
With lively boys and witching girls, 
I 
tell you it was merry ; 
I 
never shall forget that night 
A- crossing on the ferry. 
I 
paid my fare and jumped aboard— 
The weather it was breezy ; 
I 
didn't care for wind or rain, 
For I 
am free and easy : 
And I 
began to think and think 
About Beecher and Frank Moulton, 
When all at once I 
felt a 
bunk, 
And then a 
fearful jolting. 
With lively boys, etc. 
I 
felt a 
crash, and up I 
jumped, 
There was a 
fearful clatter ; 
I 
looked about, and then went out 
To see what was the matter. 
A 
gal was yellity-r murder. and 
She was a 
fearful screecher— 
I 
saw a 
man fall overboard, 
She said that it was Beecher. 
With lively boys, etc. 
Then overboard I 
quickly jumped 
To try and save the preacher, 
Because I 
thouht it would be great 
To rescue Henry Beecher : 
Bit - when I 
s
-:7-uck the water, oh ! 
You be: it set me screnmina : 
I 
found that I 
had been asleep. 
And jumped overboard while dreaming. 
With lively boys, etc. 
THE SELDOM-FED BRIGADE. 
Words and 3Iusic by 11.U:11Y BENNETT. 
W E 
are the Seldom- Fed Brigade, 
As you can plainly see ; 
We often have to miss our meals— 
With us it don't agree. 
One meal a 
day is all we get, 
For that we have to fight, 
Oatmeal for breakfast, wind for lunch, 
And a 
walk around at night. 
'We're the Seldom- Fed Brigade, 
For fighting we're not paid, 
And for our grub we get a 
club— 
That's how our soup is made ; 
If soon we are not paid, 
We'll have to make a 
raid, 
To drive away starvation from 
The Seldom- Fed Brigade. 
If we could strike a 
hash mill or 
A 
lunch route on the street, 
You bet our baskets we would fill, 
We'd show you how to eat ; 
We'd pulverize a 
restaurant. 
Or clean out a 
hotel ; 
If we can't get a 
square meal, why, 
Just let us take a 
smell. 
We're the, etc: 
Wind pudding's all we get to eat, 
Of that we're awful sick, 
And if we as 
for other grub, 
They'll Lit us with a 
brick ; 
We'll soon be healthy skeletons— 
Our clothes are -_

Oh. if you war.z. to see us bus:, 
Just chuck us down a

THE SLIGO MUSKETEERS. 
Words and Music by IlAnny BENNETT, 
On, let ye stand from under now and open wide your ears, 
11/ 
hile we relate the story of the Sligo Musketeers ; 
Sure, whin we landed on this soil out West they made us go, 
And we worked at canalimr on the Oh—ho—ho ; 
But whin the \var it did break out it took our job away, 
We organized a 
company and wint into the fray ; 
We fought the ragi4.ed rebels, boys, for many a 
weary day, 
But they couldn't bate the Sligo Musketeers. 
CHORUS. 
With our ha, ha, ha, ha, hay foot straw, we marched across 
the plain, 
And many's the time we thought we'd never see our homes 
aoain ; 
The rebels fought like divils, but their fighting was in vain, 
For they couldn't bate the Sligo Musketeers. 
We fought wid Banks and Burnside, and Nvid Grant we took a 
hack, 
But the best of all, tho' he was small, was gallant little Mac; 
Faith, if they'd let him have his way, he'd quickly drive them 
back, 
If assisted by the Sligo Musketeers ; 
Sure he knew how to engineer and likewise to command— 
No matter what your station was he'd take you by the hand ; 
lie looked so noble on his horse when he was in command 
Of us fighting boys, the Sligo Musketeers. 
With our ha, ha, etc. 
But now our have of absence, boys, is very nearly spint, 
We'd ax ye all to have a 
smile, but we're without a 
cint ; 
On Erie shares and all such snares our money it is lent— 
It completely broke the Sligo Musketeers; 
We'll say, " Good evening, one and all," your pardon, too, we 
crave; 
We did our duty manfully this country for to save; 
May the shamrock and the stars aud stripes in triumph ever 
wave 
O'er the fortunes of the Sligo Musketeers. 
With our ha, ha, etc.

BEAUTIFUL BOY. 
Ant— " 
Darling Ouhl Stick. 
It was one winter's day, about six in the morn, 
When a 
little innocent creature was born; 
There was doctor and nurse, and a 
great many more, 
But none of them saw such a 
baby before. 
They all swore I 
was like my papa, 
Yes. and see, there's the nose of his mamma 
With a 
few alterations, oh, la, la, 
We'll make him a 
beautiful boy." 
" 
To make him a 
beauty," cried. out Mrs. Sneer, 
" 
We'll be troubled unless the child has a 
sweet leer." 
Then to give me this leer Mrs. Glazier arose, 
And a 
piece of red putty stuck bang on my nose. 
This made me to wink and to blink so, 
The ladies knew not what to think, oh, 
Anil at last it turned into a 
squint, oh, 
Which made me a 
beautiful boy. 
To make me accomplished, I 
wanted one thing. 
My month was too small for the dear child to sing, 
Then to stretch it and spread it they all of them tried, 
Till they stretched my sweet month nearly half a 
yard wide 
Cryinir : " Pull away now, Mrs. Rider, 
It must be a 
little bit wider." 
My dear mouth they split pretty high, sir, 
All to make me a 
beautiful boy, 
Now, being complete, I 
was next sent to school, 
And to show off my make. was stuck en a 
high stool, 
When the children went home, they cried out with surprise: 
" 
We have a 
new boy at school with such beautiful eyes! 
He Call look any way so handy, 
Such a 
mouth he has got to suck candy ! 
And his legs are so preciously bandy, 
They call him the beautiful boy." 
Trother day I 
was asked in the city to dine. 
The ladies, in raptures, all thought me divine; 
And all, when observing my elegant grace, 
Neglected their dinner to look at my face. 
They cried: " I 
shall faint with surprise I 
No g
-as-lights can equal his eyes, 
And such a 
mouth for mince-pies! 
Law! ain't he a 
beautiful boy I" 
Now, ladies, beware of Love's powerful darts, 
For fearful I 
am I 
shall steal all your hearts, 
And then, you dear, sweet little creatures, you'll sigh, 
And doat on my charms till yon languish and die. 
For, you know, I 
can't marry you all, 
Vet, believe me, whenever you call, 
My endeavors will be to please all, 
Although such a 
beautiful boy.

A TERRIBLE EXAMPLE.

McGEE was a 
jolly old cobbler, 
He catne from the divil knows where 
Of whiskey, he was a 
great gobbler, 
And delighted to go on a" tare." 
lie was often persuaded to alter 
His habits, and live like a 
man; 
But whenever he tried, he would falter, 
And go back to his bottle and can. 
CHORUS. 
McGee was a 
terrible man, 
He was always so flighty and frisky ; 
He tried to reform, but he couldn't keep warm, 
Sure, he'd die if he hadn't his whiskey. 
His wife was a 
dacent ould woman, 
And scolded from mornin' till night ; 
She told him he must be inhuman 
To be keeping them in such a 
plight. 
He would listen in scorn and derision, 
And drink just as much as before ; 
Till at length she gave out her decision 
To begin on a 
temperance war. 
McGee was, etc. 
She went to a 
temperance preacher 
And stated the case of McGee ; 
He promised to help the poor creature— 
" 
I'll go over next mornin'," says he. 
When he came, the old cobbler was roaring 
A 
song, with his glass in his hand ; 
'Twas the glass he was fond of adoring, 
And he seemed hardly able to stand ! 
McGee was, etc. 
" 
Dear Misther McGee," said his rev'rence, 
" 
I 
hope you will alter your ways ; 
I've come now to give you deliverance 
From the evil that's blighting your days I" 
" ' Pon me sowl!" says McGee," I 
am ready, 
I'll stop with the greatest of cheer ; 
But I 
fear I 
can never be steady 
While a 
dhrop of good whiskey is near." 
McGee was, etc. 
(1) 
41 
A TERRIBLE EXAMPLE.—Concluded. 
" 
Fear not," said the man of cold water, 
" 
You'll show us how good you can be ; 
The demon of drink we will slaughter, 
And we'll honor the name of McGee." 
Then he promised to keep at a 
distance 
All drinks of whatever degree ; 
" 
Noble man, you shall have our assistance— 
In a 
week the result we will see." 
McGee was, etc. 
SPOKEN.—The reverend ,gentleman, after some further per-
suasions, took his departure, and Mr. McGee at once became a 
strict disciple of temperance. 
The sudden change of life had a 
severe effect upon him ; he lost all his exuberant spirits, la:-
ing entirely under the control of his wife and the tempera' cc 
advocates, who filled his mind every day with solemn lectures, 
and worked him into such a 
queer state—half comfort, half de-
spair— that be would often say to himself, " Begob, Fm not 
meself at all !" 
At last they induced him to state in a public 
meeting the various benefits he had derived from his adherence 
to the pledge— the comfort, the happiness, the great joy and 
peace of mind he had experienced during his short season of 
sobriety. 
He attended the meeting, and with a 
very grave 
countenance, related his experience as follows : 
RECITATION. 
Good people, I 
stand here before you to-night, 
Me mouth very dhry, and me head very light ; 
it's three weeks to-day since I 
joined in the ranks 
Of the Wather Brigade, I 
left off me mild pranks! 
And ever since tin n. sure, me life has been blessed 
With a 
great many comforts, and nights of good rest. 
I 
paid all inn debts, and I 
bought a 
new gown 
For the wife of me bosom—a 
beautiful brown— 
] 
took from the pawn shop me foin Sunday coat, 
Which cost me last winter a 
ten dollar note, 
And put a 
new sole oh the ould woman's shoes— 
A moighty big job, for she wears " twinty-two's !" 
I 
made a 
new sty for tile fine little pigs, 
And fixed up the garden with bushes and twigs ; 
I 
wint to a 
lawyer and made out my will, 
My duty to all I 
was bound to fulfill. 
And yesterday mornin' ( don't think that I'm scoffin'), 
I 
bought for me body an illioant coffin ! 
For I 
know if my whiskey is taken from me, 
You'll very soon make a 
dead man of McGee.

TLIE BARD OF ARMAGEL 
As 
sung by NED HARRIGAN. 
t 
list to the lay of a 
po )r 
Irish harper, 
And scorn not the strains of his old withered hands, 
But, remember those fingers, they once could move sharper, 
In raising the merry strains to his dear native land, 
It was long before the shamrock, dear isle, lovely emblem, 
Was crushed in its beauty, by the Saxon's lion paw, 
And all the pretty colleens around me would gather 
Call me their bold Phelim Brady, the Bard of Armagh. 
How I 
love to muse on the days of my boyhood, 
Though four score and three years have flew by them, 
It's king's sweet reflection that every young joy, 
For the merry-hearted boys make the best of old men. 
At a 
fair, or a 
wake I 
could twist my shillelah, 
And trip through a 
dance wid my brogues tied with straw, 
There all the pretty maidens around me would gather, 
Call me their bold Phelim Brady, the Bard of Armagh. 
In truth I 
have wandered this wide world all over, 
Yet Ireland's my home and a 
dwaing for me, 
And oh, let the turf that my old bones shall cover, 
Be cut from the land that is trod by the free ; 
And when serjeant death in his cold arms doth embrace. 
And lull me to sleep with old Erin-go-bragh, 
By the side of my Kathleen, my dear prIde, oh place roe. 
Then forget Phelim Brady, the Bard of Armagh.

On, there's not in ould Ireland a

As book! Paddy Flynn—be me sowl, and that's me 
At breaking the hearts of the girls I 
am A

And at breaking the heads of the boys, beat by none-
At breaking the skulls of the boys, banged by none. 
At making love, sir, Pat's the boy ; 
The ladies' hearts can't I 
decoy 
Sure don't they gambol. kiss, and toy, 
And galivant with Paddy; 
And then so shy I 
wink my eye, 
Awhile the darlint creatures, ay. 
Ala.—" Be aisy, can't you, Paddy!" 
Paddy can stuff the blarney down, 
Paddy can grief in whiskey drown, 
And crack a

Locrback Car." 
Last night I 
went a 
courting, 
And met with a 
mishap ; 
At Judy Riley's windy 
I 
went to give a 
rap : 
But had luck to the cistern 
Poor Paddy stood upon, 
'Twas like the tricks of politics— 
Not to be depended on, 
For no sooner had I 
put 
The sowl of me iligant foot 
On the lid, than it slipped, 
And whist' !—in I 
was dipped 
Souse head over heels in the butt. 
AIR.—" St. Patrick's Day." 
Faith, so many I've admired, I'm getting tired 
Of courting the smart little lasses at all ; 
I've tipped ' ern the blarney, but spite of me blarney 
They've bid Paddy (bad luck !) good morning ! 
Eve kilt all my rivals again and again, 
And nine times for love it's meself that's been slain 
Wid grief I 
am laden, for fear an mild maiden 
I'll die without wedlock adorning. 
AIR.—" The Ould Bog Ifoie." 
So now, who'll marry a 
nate Irishman? 
For a 
lady I'll do all iver I 
can; 
I'm not very rich, but I'm born to good luck, 
I've a 
cow just died and a 
dropsical duck ; 
I'm expecting a 
fortune, and sure it won't fail 
Tc come— when the income tax they repale. 
Shell I 
spake to the praist to make it all right, 
And order for music a 
plany _fortnight ? 
Who'll wed a 
boy from the Emerald Isle ? 
Who'll on the suit of a 
bold Paddy smile'? 
Who'll send a 
letter me grief to beguile 1 
To Pat Number One-ty- one Lower Turnstile. 
Who'll wed a 
boy, etc.

AN ILIGANT WAKE. 
A IR.—" Darling Ould Stick." 
Sung by BILLY ASHCROFT. 
IN 
Dublin, that city of riches and fame, 
A shoemaker died, Jerry Flynn was his name, 
The neighbors all grieved, rich and poor, high and low, 
And to the wake of poor Jerry resolved for to go. 
SPOKEN.—Poor Jerry! Though he often half- soled shoes, he 
was a 
11) 7/o/c-smiled man himself, and many's the job he done for 
nothing, 
lie mended Tim Reilly's brogans, and pegged Mrs. 
M'Carthy, and gave her a new patch on her upper, an' all for 
sixpence ; so no wondher they all came to his wake. 
Tim 
Donohoe wint for a 
coach for the ladies; he stuffed the fine soft 
straw feather bed in the bottom of Con Casey's wheelbarrow ; 
he smoothed down the long feathers for fear any of them might 
stick in the ladies, and hurt their—feelings, as he handed them 
in. 
CHORES . 
Mrs. Casey and Mrs. 01Ilaney, 
Kate Nolan and Widow Delaney, 
Aul the iligant Judy M'Shaney, 
To go to the beautiful wake. 
All dressed out so neat in their best Sunday clothes, 
Wid Doherty showing his jolly red nose, 
And another big party about twenty score, 
All met them a 
knocking at Jerry Flynn's door. 
SPOKEN —" Mrs. Flynn ! Mrs. Flynn ! why the blazes don't 
you open the door 7 
Here's the quality coming to Jerry's wake. 
Stick him rip slantindickler in the bed ; clap a 
cane pipe in his 
mouth and put a 
nightcap on him, that he may look nate and 
dacint. 
Mistress Biddy, will you shake some cane straw in the 
corner for the ccmpany to sit down on ? There yees are all now 
as snug as a 
bug in a 
rug,. 
Come. now, Darby Reilly, while 
Nelly's mixing the punch, will yon .inst tip us a 
bit of a 
song ?" 
'• Faix I 
will, main ; 
give you, a 
verse from the Opery of Go 
to the Divil and shake yourself." " Silence' Pat Doyle, I'll run 
a 
sod of turf in your gob if you don't hould your tongue. Darby 
Reilly is going to sing ; silence." 
(Sings in a 
drawling tone.) 
Ata.—" Raging Canawl." 
011, once I 
never thought I'd be 
In this dejected state, 
A poor, forlorn efti2y 
Bound down by hardship's fate. 
(1) 
AN ILIGANT WAKE.—Continued. 
The birds that flutter on yon tree, 
With terror strike my heart; 
Aich star I 
see alarums me— 
Oh, why did 1 
des- art 
5.?oKas,—" Oh, WOW, ow 
Ii can't bear to sing any more, its 
too distressing for my delicate nerves. 
Missus M .:Nulty, will ye 
thry a 
song, main ?" " Thoth I 
will, Darby. Here goes." 
(Mrs. .11'..Yulty sings.) 
Oa! one evening for dervarsion's sake 
As I 
walked out alone, 
I 
heard a 
faymale lady bright 
Making her piteous moan. 
She wrung her bands and tore her hair, 
And to herself did cry, 
Aarrah, Johnny dear, don't murther me, 
For if you do I'll die. 
SP-JSIEN.—Here's Nelly wid the punch, now hand it round to 
Hrs. M'Carthy and -Mrs. 0 
Blaney, 
Fate Nolan and Widow Delaney, 
Aad the beautiful Judy M'Shaney, 
A.nd all at the iligant wake. 
Now the vhiskey went round till they couldn't agree, 
Who was of the best rank or the best family ; 
They from words came to blows, and their fists didn't spare, 
And by haadfuls they pulled out each other's hair. 
SPOKEN.-01 ,, 
ladies! ladies ! aren't you forsbamed av your-
selves, to behave like a 
set of jackasses ! Oh Judy, Judy ! Judy! 
Divil roaa me but they've got Jerry in amongst them ; they'll

A VIRGIN, ONLY 19 YEARS OLD. [ CoscLuDED.1 
Her fingers were taper'd, her neck like the swan, 
Her nose was a 
turn-up, and her voice not too strong; 
In three weeks we were married, and the wedding bells told 
That I'd married a 
virgin—yes, a 
virgin, only 19 years old! 
The wedding-party broke up, and we retired to rest, 
But my hair stood right up when my bride she undress'd ; 
For a 
cartload of padding my young bride did unfold, 
A thing rather peculiar, very peculiar, for 19 years old 
First, she took off her right foot, about a 
foot wide, 
Then she unscrewed her left ear and laid it aside, 
Then she pull'd out her right eye, on the carpet it roll'd; 
Thinks I, here's a 
virgin—what a 
virgin, only 19 years old 
Next she unscrewed her right leg as far as the knee, 
Then pull'd off her fingers, I 
counted just three; 
Then on her left shoulder a 
larre lump I 
did behold, 
So I 
said, there's a 
virgin—yes, a 
virgin, only 19 years old 
When she wiped off her eyebrows I 
thought I 
should faint, 
And scraped from her thin cheeks a 
cartload of paint ; 
When she pull'd off her black wig then her bald pate soon told 
That she was an old virgin, an old virgin, more than 19 years oiei ! 
When she pull'd out her false teeth, I 
jumped up in terror, 
For her nose and her chin very near stuck together, 
From the chamber I 
stepp'd it, never more to behold 
This virgin not nineteen‘—uo, not nineteen, but 99 years old 
Now, young men, take warning, e'er to church you go, 
Be sure your wife's perfect from the top to the toe, 
Or you'll pay for your folly, and like me be sold 
By some patch'd-up old virgin, cruel old virgiu,'bout 99 years old

DIGGING FOR GOULD. 
Darby Kelly below in Killkenny did live, 
A sketch of whose character I'm going to give; 
He was thought by the people a 
green polished rogne, 
He could wasfle the whiskey, or wastle the old brogue; 
All kinds of diseases with herbs he could cure, 
he'd interpret your dreams to be certain and sure, 
By the boys of the village he often was fool'd ; 
For aslape or awake, he was dreaming of gould. 
Fol de dol, &c. 
lie had a 
fine open house, but the winMers were broke, 
The gables were down to let out the smoke; 
Some beautiful pigs, through the wide world to range, 
Though they were thin, they were thick with the mange, 
lie was so neglectful of domestic affairs, 
The rats eat the bottoms all out of the chairs, 
And the wife by the husband was so overruled, 
When she asked him for coppers. he was talking of gould. 
Fol de dol, & c. 
The house thus neglectco, sure nothing went right ; 
When a 
youth of the village came to him, one night, 
A nice boy he was, his name was Dan Mac, 
And ready to fly with the duds on his back ; 
All the clothes that he had wasn't enough 
To make him a 
bolster to stick on a 
crutch, 
And his juvenile days in a 
lime-kiln were schooled, 
But he used to cod Darby about finding gould. 
Fol de dol, (fre. 
Save Dan; -Ere last night I 
had a 
beautiful dream; 
Bit bad luck to the doubt ! last night I'd the same; 
And to-day, as I 
dozed, after slacking some lime, 
I 
dreamt it again for the third and last time. 
Och, murder ! sAys Darby, come tell us your dream, 
Same time his two eyes like rockets did gleam, 
Says Dan; I 
dreamt at the castle Kilcool 
I 
found a 
jar that waz crammed full of gould.

DIGGING FOR GOULD. —L
CONCLUDED.1 
Poor Darby a 
big mouth opened like a 
dead Hoicks, 
Saville.: You'll be a 
hero, just like your name- sake; 
You'll ride in your coach, you fortunate elf, 
While I 
may be in one, going down to the hulks. 
,No matter, said Darby, we must emigrate, 
So, come down at mid.,ivgllt, and &tit be too late; 
Bring some boys whoee courage won't easy be cooled, 
And we'll dig till daylight to find all the gould. 
1
7°1 tie dol, k. 
They arrlyea at rue castle, at about one o'clock, 
Where Dan dreamt he found all the gold in a 
crock, 
They all set to work with picks, shovels and spades. 
And a 
hole, that would swallow a 
house, soon was mad' 
Says Darby: Bad luck to the curse we must give. 
Or well be beggars as long as we live ! 
Says Dan : My the devil on my back be stooled, 
For, I 
have bursted my breeches in digging for gould ! 
Fol de dol, ecc. 
The prayers availed noming„ the crock was soon found, 
Tim Rooney he lifted it over the ground ; 
With joy Darby leaped on the back of Ned Fail, 
Like a 
fish from the stream with a 
hook in his tail, 
Says Darby : My wife won't abuse me to- night, 
When I 
take home the shiners so yellow and bright 
I'll buy house and land about Killcool. 
And we'll all bless the night we went digging for gould I 
Fol de dol, dte. 
The cron was men placed on Darby's ° cm back, 
To carry home and each man have his whack, 
Thee arrived at the door with the gould to be sacked, 
When Mac with a 
spade knocked the crock into smash 
Poor Darby, near smothered, ran in with affright ; 
His wife jumps up to get him a 
light : 
When she beard Darby mourning, her passi ,,n was cooled ; 
She knew by the smell he was covered with gould! 
Fol (la dol. & c. 
IT 
was down in Queenstown harbor, 
The morphia I 
set sail, 
My mammy cried to me, " Oh, John ; 
Your heart will never fail ; 
You're leavine poor old Ireland," 
My mother said to me ; 
" 
Arrah, don't foreet the dear ould sod 
Across the deep blue sea." 
The boys and uirls all ' round me 
Did shed the parting tear ; 
Mv hun ,•ry eyes were fastened on 
The form to me so dear ; 
She waved her poor old withered hand, 
And cried out, " John machree, 
Arrah, don't foreet the dear ould sod 
Wheu you cross the deep blue sea." 
The very winds did sob and moan, 
As we put out to sea, 
A sad farewell to Ireland, growing, 
Dim upon our lee ; 
But through my brain kept ringing sti71 
Her parting w 
ords to me— 
" 
Arrah, don't foreet the dear ould sod 
When you cross the deep blue sea." 
When I 
landed in New York 
I 
felt both strange and queer ; 
'Twa= soon I 
had the money earned 
To brine the oil mother here, 
And as she stepped upon the docIt 
She " Grab 0-ra, machree,

M ESELF and Barney Casey whit to have a 
little spree, 
lie had a 
bottle for himself, and another one for me ; 
We thravell'd round the city till our heads and feet were sore, 
And ev'ry dhrink it was so nice, it made us wish for more.

Bin 
i 
luck to Casey's whiskey, it made us both so frisky, 
We dbrank our bottles empty, and at last we couldn't stand ; 
Alon'T the streets we rambled, we staggered and we scrambled, 
And san , a 
song, the whole night long, of gay ould Paddy's 
land. 
We met a 
big policeman, and he looked at us, says be, 
" 
What brings you out so late as this 1'' says I, " the counthry's 
free ;" 
" 
Shut up," says Casey, " come along I" " 0, divil a

" 
stbrike him if he says a 
word, the durty mane ould spy." 
SPOKEN — And if I 
ever did sthrike him he m4Y.,Iit well say— 
Bad luck to, etc. 
He turned around and left us—sure the man was not to blame, 
I 
called him back, and axed him if he'd plase to tell Ids name ; 
" 
Of eoorse," says he, " it's Flanigan, Em from the county 
Clare." 
" 
Hurroo!" says I, " shake hands, me b'y, our whiskey you must 
share l" 
Bad luck to, etc. 
Out kern the empty bottle, and I 
put it in his paw, 
" 
Look out," say he, " whin on me post, a 
dhrink's against the 
law." 
lie put the bottle to his mouth, but divil a 
dhrop was there, 
And while we laughed at Flark.-

Bad luck to, etc. 
He raised his club above his head, and vow'd he'd take us in 
For dlitinking on the highway, " 0," says Casey, " that's too 
thin !" 
lie dhragged poor Casey off to jail, and thried to take me too, 
But to keep a 
hoult on Casey was as much as he could do. 
SroKr.N.—I pitied poor Casey and I 
suppose he pitied me. 
But it was all his own doings. 
The two bottles fixed him.

THE CHAP IN NUMBER NINE. 
By J. B Multruy. 
Sung. by JOHNNY W ILD. 
FOLKS wonder why I 
look so glum and seldom show my face, 
As once I 
did, a 
year ago, in every public place ; 
But they don't know how my poor heart was shivered up so fine, 
By him that lives across the street—the chap in No. 9. 
cnoncs. 
My heart is broke—I 
nearly choke—when thinking of the time, 
That Sarah Glass—run off, alas—with the chap in No. 9. 
I'll tell you simply how it was and how it came to pass : 
I 
loved a 
chambermaid next door, her name was Sarah Glass ; 
I 
thought her soul a 
mirror pure—reflecting truth to mine, 
The' oft she flashed a 
smile upon the chap in No. 9. 
My heart is broke, etc. 
I 
took Miss Glass to operas, balls, and every brilliant place, 
And doated on her crystal eyes and clear, transparent face ; 
I 
bought her gems of sparkling hue and presents rare arid fine, 
And dreamed of her and future bliss, nor thought of No. 9. 
My heart is broke, etc. 
At length the wished-for time was fixed to join our fates for life. 
When Sarah Glass should ease my pains and be my darling wife; 
I 
danced and sang all day with joy, such bliss I 
can't define, 
Nor envied once the fortunes of the chap in No. 9. 
My heart is broke, etc. 
Alas ! upon the very day that we were to be wed, 
My hopes were shattered— Sarah Glass cleared out, vamoosed 
and fled ; 
Her vows as brittle as her name, she broke with full design, 
She sloped—run off—got—went—with the chap in No. 9. 
My heart is broke, etc. 
And now the dark and dismal hours in loneliness I 
pass, 
Like some deserted picture- frame, forsaken by my glass ; 
Life's bitter goblet thus I 
drain and not a 
hope is mine, 
For tbey were smashed to pieces by the chap in No. 9. 
My heart is broke, etc.

ALL THE WORLD AROUND.—[CoNcLuDED.] 
Where are prayers for Ireland, 
Breathed soft and low— 
Earnest prayers and tender, 
Asking God to send her 
Peace and joy and splendor, 
Ending all her woe ? 
They are heard wherever 
Ireland's sons are found, 
From snow-clad lands to tropic sands, 
All the world around. 
Cho.—All the world around, my boys, 
All the world around; 
To heaven they rise, through all the skies, 
All the world around. 
Where is aid for Ireland,. 
If the need should be ? 
If a 
foe oppress her, 
If a 
wrong distress her, 
Men who would redress her, 
Where shall Ireland see? 
Here, in crowds uncounted, 
here such men are found, 
And friends as true, not faint or few, 
All the world around. 
Cho.—All the world around, my boys, 
All the world around; 
Fond hearts and bold, she may behold, 
All the world around. 
Yes, beloved Ireland, 
All so dear thou art, 
Where young men, or hoary, 
Tell of Brian's glory, 
Where O'Neill's, sad story 
Thrills through many a 
heart ; 
Where Emmet's speech is spoken, 
Where '.‘toore's sweet songs resound, 
Where fond acclaim greets Grattan's name, 
All the world around. 
Cho.— All the world around, my boys, 
All the world around; 
There's help and cheer for Ireland dear, 
All the world around.

I 
hear an angel sing, 
In the cottage by the sea; 
Give me back my wedding- ring, 
,Sally is the girl for me. 
Put me in my little bed, 
Where the foaming billows roll ; 
I 
have not got nary red; 
Johnny, come fill up the bowl. 
Let me like a 
soldier fall, 
When the bloom is on the rye; 
Waiter, brim, me one fish-ball, 
how is that, old boy, for high I 
Susey stole my heart from me, 
And she put it up the spout; 
Johnny's on another spree, 
That old thing is about played out. 
Mary had a 
little sheep, 
Great on eating mutton- pies ; 
Mother, I 
came home to sleep, 
Wake me up, when Kirby dies.

What stories he'd tell when Ids dudeen was lit, 
While he smoked away in the corner; 
When supper was over the neighbors dropped in, 
And by the turf fire each roasted his shin, 
While the boys and the girls ne'er thought it a

For to hug and to kiss in 'tie corner. 
When Jimm;

The young people all made it rush for the door, 
Dragging Jimmy along to the barn, and sure 
They placed him high up in the corner; 
Then at it they went dear with hearts light and gp7, 
And danced the night hours into the young day, 
'Till Jimmy got drunk an' no longer could play, 
For he lay pipes and all in the corner.
