In all the festive glory 
Of gay flags and banners bright 
The merry picnic barge is drifting, 
Thro' the starry night; 
And borne across the waters 
Come sounds of music sweet, 
And merry laugh, and joyous shout 
And pat of tripping feet, oh! 
CHORUS. 
On the picnic barge they dance, 
In the moonlight soft they dance, 
Down the river ,
*,liding free, 
To rich music's melody; 
'Round the deck the merry feet, 
In a 
jolly measure beat, 
Whirl and glide, as down with the tide, 
On the barge they lightly dance. 
A 
vision of rare beauty, 
Floating gently down the stream, 
Thro' plashing waters silvered 
By each brilliant moonlight beam. 
A time for joy and pleasure, 
For merry dance and song, 
A time to tell love's sweetest story, 
While we drift along. 
On the licnic barge, etc,

In a 
little cot not far from here 
There lives the girl I 
love, 
To me she is as beautiful 
As the stars that shine above. 
Nancy Green that is her name, 
Her parents they like me, 
And every Sunday afternoon 
Miss Nancy I 
go to see. 
• CHORUS. 
Pretty little Nancy will you love me ? 
For you know I 
love you, Nancy Green, 
I 
will love you in the morning and the evening, 
If you will only wed me, Nancy Green. 
'Twas in among the sweet grape vine 
Where first I 
met Miss Nance, 
The little birds sang sweetly. 
My heart was in a 
trance. 
I 
asked her lor to marry me, 
She did not answer no. 
And on next Sunday afternoon 
We both to the church will go.

0, my, I 
feel as 
happy as a 
bird! (Goes to mirror and arranges her toilet, steps 
off and admires herself in the mirror.) 
There! I 
guess I 
look 
good enough to receive my husband when he comes home to 
dinner (comes forward) and he's such a 
good husband, so clever, 
generous to a 
fault; never says a 
cross word, no matter where 
I 
go nor when I 
come, it's all the same, and I 
pass the time so 
pleasantly, going shopping, driving in the Park, and attending 
the matinees (takes book from, table and reclines on lounge, turns 
over leaves of book), and my husband never finds a 
bit of fault; 
and it would'nt do for him to deprive me of my little enjoy-
ments, for my parents always indulged me in everything I 
de-
sired, 'cause I 
was the pet of the family. 
0, I 
am so fond of 
riding, and enjoy a 
good story (turns leaves of book rapidly). 
Let me see, where did I 
leave off? 0 
yes, here's the place. 
A

lightning speed, waving in his hand (suddenly interrupted by

(
Exits hurriedly.) 
Enter 
HUSBAND (humming a 
lively air, puts off hat and gloves on the 
table, rubs his hands in glee,)—By Jove ! 
I'm the happiest man 
alive. 
I 
have done a 
splendid business to- day ; paid all my 
bills, and have'lit got a 
dollar left to my name. 
Yes, if there is 
anything I 
like to do it is to pay my debts. 
And I've got such 
a 
darling wife, so economical, never runs any bills, buys very 
little of anything. 
Ali, there's nothing like an economical wo-
man. 
We've been married about two weeks, and everything 
goes on splendid. 
No bills to pay, and a 
darling little wife to 
meet you with a 
kiss at the door. 
Yes, I 
am as happy as the 
day is long. 
(Sings song of that title. 
After song looks about.) 
Ieigh ho! I 
wonder where my wife can be (goes to table and 
takes vp newspaper and reclines on the lounge,) 
Perhaps she is 
dressing for dinner. 
Well dinner won't be ready for an hour 
yet. so I'll lust read the news and then get ready for dinner, 
(turns over paper to read.) 
Ah, if there's anything I 
do enjoy 
it is to get home from the toils of the day, have a 
rest, read the 
news, and etcetera (reads aloud.)

SERVANT (bowing.)—Numerous bills, sir. 
HUSBAND. —
Put numerous bills on the table, John, (Servant 
does same as before and exit.) 
I'm atraid I'm going to have an 
attack of " Bi//iousness. 
What in the world does all these 
bills mean? (Goes to table and reads aloud the bills.) 
Two 
weeks carriage hire, 100 dollars; camel's hair shawl, 700 dol-
lars; forty pair ten button kid gloves, 120 dollars; one box 
striped hose. 
Now what in the world does this mean? I 
bought an injun rubber hose last week to sprinkle the sidewalk 
and street. 
There must be some mistake about these bills. 
They've got in the wrong house. (Examines one of the bills and 
starts.) 
No, by heavens! they are made out in the name of 
my wife. 
Goodness gracious! It can't be possible my wife has 
been so awful extravagant. 
If this be so I 
am a 
ruined man! 
(Walks to and fro with hands in his pockets; turns pockets inside 
out.) 
Yes, I 
am a 
ruined man; bills to pay and not a 
cent in 
the treasury ! 
(Slaps hand to his head.) And I 
shall be obliged 
to go into bankruptcy; 
Serves me right! 
It all comes from 
me marrying with the pet of the family." A 
woman who has 
been indulged in all kinds of extravagance and luxury. ( Voice 
of lady heard outside singing.) 
And here she comes, 
Enter 
LADY (
goes to him,)-0, my darling, I 
am so glad you have

I've been practicing that beautiful 
song I 
heard at the matinee. 
The title is " Never go beyond 
your means." 
HUSBAND,—Yes, that's a 
title I 
like to hear, and I 
know that 
song all by heart; I 
sing it every day. (Both sine sona -)1 
that 
title.) 
Yes, my darling, and it's a 
beautiful practice to follow 
up, this living within o!ig4u422?s. 
LADY.—Yes, I 
do admire and sustain that principle so 
much. 
HUSBAND.—So

LADY.—Judge by what I 
HUSBAND ( pointing to table.)—Those bills on the table, 
LADY (alarmed.)—Why you don't mean to say that you can' t 
pay those bills. 
HUSBAND (amazed.)—Pay them, madam! Why, I 
have'nt 
got a 
dollar to my name. I 
will be a 
bankrupt if I 
have to pay 
those bills. 
LADY (in despair.)-0, what have I 
done ? (aside.) My 
husband will never forgive me for being so extravagant. I 
must plead some excuse. 
I 
have it. 
Insanity is all the rage, 
and I 
will plead insanity, Yes, that is my only hope. (Looking 
wildly about.) 0

(Looking after her.) 
Here, John, John! (Enter Servant.) Look 
after your mistress while I 
go for the doctor; fasten all the 
windows down, and keep a 
strict watch on her (mashes his hat 
over his eyes and exits hurriedly.) 
SERvANT (looking after him.)—What in the world is the

Good gracious! the master has jumped

Enter 
HUSBAND (L, 2d E, looking wild and excited, has a

She's insane; my wife's insane ; I've married a

tic, a

0, what shall I 
do? 
I'll go mad ! Yes, 
I

to any address, post-paid, on receipt of 85 cents 
When I 
landed at Castle Garden, 
About ten years ago, 
I 
made my home in a 
tenement house, 
In Cherry street below, 
'Twas there I 
got acquainted 
Wid a 
German girl so gay, 
It was only six months after, 
She named my wedding day. 
Cuonus. 
Ring a 
wreath of roses, 
We'll ring a 
wreath for thee, 
All the little children, 
Sang so sweet to me; 
Ladies came in carriages, 
With presents and boquets, 
To little Michael Callihan, 
Upon his wedding day. 
It was on a 
Saturday evening, 
With laugh and merry shout. 
The boys and girls in the neighborhood, 
So gaily did turn out ; 
The old folks dressed their very best, 
And had funny things to say 
To Mike and Lena Callihan, 
Upon their wedding day. 
.i '
sent 
(Chorus.) 
There was August Schmitt and Kunkle, 
And Henry Ciselmyer, 
With all my wife's relations, 
And Cohn the old clothes buyer. 
My brothers Pat and Danny, 
Wid the ladies danced the glide, 
But the Germans tried to kill them when 
They tried to kiss the bride.

The Man that Stole the Country. 
Written by FRANK E. 
McNtsn, expressly for M URPHY and 
Pet.-cli.. 
We'll tell you of a 
ternble thief, 
Who for stealing things could not be beat. 
He'd even steal the grub he'd eat, 
The man that stole the country. 
In his sleep he'd dream of what he'd done, 
And when he'd awake, the son of a 
gun. 
He'd get up and go out and steal for fun, 
The man that stole the country. 
CHORUS. 
He stole a 
horse, he stole a 
cow, 
A 
stack of hay and a 
cast-iron plow. 
He swiped a 
dog most dead with old age, 
A 
whole row of footlights off from a 
stage. 
Last night he came in this very place, 
And took the nose right off a 
man's face. 
All kinds of fish, from a 
whale to a 
perch, 
Even the steeple of Trinity Church. 
A 
pile of timber, a 
liberty pole, 
Stewart's body he must have stole. 
He was bred of a 
family of very bad rank, 
He stole all the bonds in Manhattan Bank. 
The Elevated Road he would have got 
If it hadn't been riveted to the spot. 
He'd steal the tongue out of your mouth 
While you would be talking; 
He stole the shoes off O'Leary 
While he was a 
walking. 
He stole a 
mule that was dying with cramps, 
Then went out West and collared all tramps ; 
Into a 
shop awl sneaked out the boss, 
Over to Philadelphia and nipped Charlie Ross.. 
In Gilmore's Garden 1
-
.e collared the track, 
He even tried to steal Murphy and Mack, 
18 
THE MAN THAT STOLE THE COUNTRY. 
Continued. 
And still he wasn't satisfied— 
The man that stole the country. 
To Blackwell's Island he was stet, 
And life- time given to repent 
For things he'd done with bad intent--
The man that stole the country. 
But the villain he was very bold, 
And prison walls could not him hold, 
And he's around again, so we're told— 
The man that stole the country. 
CHORUS. 
A 
pair of boots a 
tub, and a 
saw, 
The wonderful man with the cast-iron jaw. 
A 
full brass band, and a 
new piano, 
The bal'ot boxes in Louisiana. 
Pre,;ider.t Hayes' ulster and beaver, 
\Vent to New Orleans and took the fever ; 
Came tc, New York to steal Hell Gate, 
And he'd had it, too, if he hadn't been late. 
Ile stole a 
whole gang that were out on a 
lark, 
If he hadn't been watched he'd had Central Park. 
Stole a 
street car, the driver and all, 
Then went up and took Tammany Hall. 
Took a 
cop right off from his beat, 
Stole all the bears there were in Wall street. 
To steal the City Hall he often did wish, 
He took the false teeth away from McNish. 
He stole a 
house they had just finished building, 
Took Bessie Turner from Theodore Tilton. 
Into a 
school and nipped the teacher, 
He'd had Elizabeth, too, if it wasn't for Beecher. 
Stole some young folks that were playing backgammon, 
Wmt to the London and stole Murphy and Shannon ; 
And still he was not satisfied— 
The : an that stole the country

as the hit of the season

There is a 
girl of famous note 
Among the upper nine, 
Considerably comilfo, 
Or something in that line; 
When but a

The sudden name of " Nan," 
But now her high tuned monnygram

CHORUS. 
Bidalia Jane McCann, the elegant Miss McCann, 
There's none so sweet as her, no girl so neat as her, 
Peggy or Julia, Johanna or Kate, like Bidalia Jane McCann, 
The elegant Miss McCann, I'm sure there's not wan, 
That can bate the bon-ton of Bidalia Jane McCann. 
Her education's wonderful, 
She spells and writes by ear, 
She plays the " Maiden's Prairie," 
And sings " Beloved Ear." 
She says, " I 
feel so fatigayed 
I 
don't know what to do," 
Says I, " Bidale, some grub and ale, 
Might help your fatigu." 
(Chorus.) 
She gives a " German" every week, 
And " Irish" too as well, 
She says a 
cork would shade my. 
face, 
So I 
could tend the bell; 
She sings duets all by herself, 
She talks French like a

She's very aurevoir indeed,

Our club is always noted for its larking and sparkin' 
Such dancin' and singin' and jolly sport have we; 
Cur picnics bate them all without denial, a

Would set you wild with pleasure at the Twilight Coteri.

And still the fiddle and the horns are soundin' while

Then it's on a 
summer's night in the park, my boys, 
Where the merry girls are singin' light and free, 
Hands around and round, and round, oh! what a 
lark, my 
boys, 
How the spielers prance, at the moonlight dance, of the 
Twilight Coterie. 
There's honored delegations from the " Starlights" and 
"Skylights," 
The " Ours" and " Yours" and other coteries, 
Together with their friends and their ladies, the daisies, 
In vit ed guest whose hearts are blessed with all the beet 
they please; 
It's skip and dip, and sachez round in glory, 
Oh, Kate asthore 1 
bang the floor, that's the style of girl

And so around we balance, and each daisy is crazy 
Wid great hilarity, all at the Twilight Coterie.

IT SHOULD BE ABOLISHED. 
COMIC STUMP SPEECH. 
BY SAUL SERTREW. 
Fellow Human.s 4. Beings. 
My discturse this evening, am in reference to the great hue 
and cry that is flying around like an auctioneer's hammer, and 
you hear the universal kickingand squealing that things ain't 
i!k they used to was, and the present existence should be ab-
olished. 
Everybody v,-antg. a 
new deal ; things are all wrong, the times 
r‘z..e upside down, the people are upside down, and everything 
is keel up wr are drifting, drifting with that tide which is 
bound to carry us over the falls and drop us in the turbulent 
waters be:ow, and those that can't swim will have to walk it. 
But I 
differ; I 
waiver as to these Telephone Elucidations, 
and I 
stand herein absence of a 
chair, to contest and request 
‘v.iyt" ,re this abolishment, and what are you going to do about 
it ! 
I 
vill now shuffle a 
new pack of cards, give you all a 
hand 
and take one myself. 
This great hue and cry about the doubtful state of our eottn-
try Sausages, hard times, bank corruptcy and cashier elope 
ments—Why should'nt it be so t 
and how can it be otherwise 
For instance; if a 
rich man owes five dollars and they won't 
let him pay it, he takes the benefit of the bankrupt act, goes 
into bankruptcy and the five dollars is abolished. 
But if a 
poor 
man sees a 
pig's bead, in front ot a 
butcher shop, and his fami-
ly is starving. and he goes in and asks the butcher for the loan 
of it, does lie get it? 
No ! 
And if he takes the pig's bead on 
his 3wn recognizance is the act abolished, does he get away 
with the pig's head? No. 
What does he get ?—( Voice behind 
Yew.) " Six months." 
That's what makef:, hard times, 
bankruptcy an (=latex 
17 
elopements; they woq't let the rich man pay his debts, and the 
poor man can't borrow anything. 
Again, on the other hand, it don't make any difference which 
hand; I'll shake you for the segars. 
They say people are drinking more than they ever did be-
tore, and " Murphy's " act on temperance, is drawing full houses, 
packed " tight," standing room only, and some of them can't 
stand at that. 
Nowadays, if a man stays out late at night, to see the 
eclipse of the moon, "full moon" and he has a. parting "smile" 
with the man in the moon, and 
comes home fully 
satis-
fied, too full for utterance and he is found dead on his own door 
step, dead drunk, then with one voice they raise the hue and 
cry ; It's rum ! it's rum ! that did it, and it should be abolished. 
Now in the name of E. pluribus unum. 
If a 
man eats salt 
mackrell for his breakfast and his tongue becomes glued to the 
ceiling of his mouth, and to way- lay his thirst, he drinks a 
bucket of water, and the salt mackrell is drownded; and the 
man dies of this hard drink, (
ice water) does that follow that 
drinking should be abolished, 
and :your water 
shut off'? 
And why for this increase of thirst and crooked whiskey ? 
Because the bar tumbler's are too small you can't get one 
above your nose without tipping 
it. 
Once it was "pony of 
brandy. 
Duck on the rock," now it is Rye and Rock ; some 
take schooners, and go to beering strait. ( Bebring strait.) 
But 
the only way you can get ahead on these small drinks, is to join 
a 
brass band and take a 
"horn" you can " blow about." 
And again, you hear of starvation, and yet while I 
was cash-
ing a 
check in a 
bank restaurant. I 
saw a 
man come in and 
18 
order a 
five cent plate of " Hash," and while he was devouring 
the aforesaid plate of hash, the man's teeth came in contact 
with an over coat button, he called for a 
stomach pump and 
after pumping for an hour or two the over 
ejected, and the man got up and put a 
head 
cause it was not a 
silk umbrella. 
Now does 
the woman you board with should be arrested and Hash 
distilleries abolished. 
coat button was 
on the waiter be-
that follow that 
No, my fellow students, this work of abolishment is no con-
umdrum for to be guest by every Hotel or Boarding House. 
Look at the increase of crime. 
You take up a morning 
paper, and it is full of murders most fowl; without regard to 
spring chickens or boned turkey. There's the case of the ' Slaugh-
ter of the Inocent's," where the wretch finds a pair of twin 
kittens 
Thomas awl Maria.," in his best Sunday Hat, and in a 
moment of passion, be seizes the poor little innocent kittens and 
drowns them in a 
tea cup. Then full of remorse for what he has 
done, he ties a 
shoe string around his neck and hangs himself out 
of a 
seven story window; the shoe string breaks, the man falls to 
the ground and escapes. 
Now does that follow because a 
man 
" 
ropes '' in with a 
barkeeper, gives him " tafy" and hangs him 
up for the beer, that hanging should be hbolished. 
If there's anytniug I 
like to see hanging, it's a 
woman, hang-
ing on a 
clothes line, her week's washing, or hanging on a 
man's arm, going in a 
restaurant for an oyster slipper. 
One shows industry, and the other love and adoration, 
Adoration. 
Oh, how beautiful, 
to 
see a man adoring a 
woman. 
Yes 1 
heard a 
man adoring a woman the other night 
sight next door ti. me. 
He came up stairs, knocked at the door 
19 
of his wife's abode with the heel of his boot, and because she 
did'nt hear him, he jerked the door from it's hinges and to show 
his ad-door-ation for his wife he split her over the head with 
the door and broke it in a thousand pieces. 
Now does that 
follow that the society for the prevention of kindness to mother-
in- laws should be abolished and women have no suffrage. 
-Woman's suffarage, 
Ah, there's no one knows what a 
woman suffers, she will suffer age a 
long while before she will 
own it. 
Yes, it's dreadful this unhappy state of " Matri-money " and 
even our own money. 
There's no one can tell what a 
dollar is 
worth nowadays, 
And as to matrimony now, a 
man entertain-
ing marriage, seeks for a 
wife who bas'nt got a 
mind of her 
own, so she won't be forever giving him a 
piece of it. 
And then our mother-in-laws, see how they are abused, now 
when a man's wife invites her mother to come and stay a 
month or two, what does the husband do? Why he gets up 
the report that the neighbor next door has got the yellow- fever, 
and his wife's mother had better postpone her visit for the next 
five years. 
Then the mother smells a 
mice and comes down 
and opens a circus in the house, and (
lloud voice outside.) 
Where is he, where is my son-in-law, I'll let the people know 
who he is, laying home drunk all day, arid then going round 
nights preaching temperance.) 
That's the voice of my motherinlaw, and it's time I wasint 
here. ( Works fright wig.)

Not On the Mash. 
Written by FRANK E. 
McNisii expressly for M URPHY and M ACK, 
" 
Forget Me Not." 
Oh, I'm in love with all the girls, 
The short, the lean, and tall, 
And I 
know that they are gone on me, 
For after me they call : 
There goes the beau ideal of man, 
I 
wish he'd come this way ; 
But I 
surprise them all, indeed, 
When this to them I 
say— 
CHORUS. 
Get thee gone, you naughty girls, 
1'11 strike you with my stick ; 
If ever I 
blow my breath on you, 
I'll make you fearful sick. 
Your mamma she won't know you 
When you go home to hash, 
So keep away from me, I 
say, 
For I'm not on the mash. 
One young girl, she loved me so, 
She wanted me to elope ; 
One hundred thousand dollars had she, 
While my poor bank was broke. 
I 
says, young lady, you must know 
That I 
love single days ; 
Yourself or money I 
don't want, 
So this to her I 
says— 
Get thee gone, & c.

President McMullen. 
Original words and music by JOHN E. 
M URPHY, and sung by him with 
great success at the London Theatre, New York. 
I 
am a 
politician of integrity and fame, 
I'm a 
candidate for the President, and McMullen, that's my 
name ; 
l'm the talk of all the city now, it's well I 
know my fate, 
Four dollar cigars will not be smoked when McMullen rules 
the State. 
CHORUS. 
I'll give you my idea, that is, I'll give you some, 
Of what McMullen intends to do when he's there in Wash, 
ington. ( Repeat.) 
I'll raise the laborers' wages, politicians' I'll reduce, 
Soap and sugar I'll give away, and all kinds of produce; 
kll Chinese must emigrate, and go back home again, 
And when I'm there in Washington I'll stick to Senator Blaine. 
I'll give you my idea, &c. 
No crooked men in office, stealing money from the poor, 
Politicians will have no graft, or any sinecure ; 
The world will be rejoicing, and my friends will propagate, 
And they'll all find money in the street when McMullen rules 
the State. 
I'll give you ny: idea. & c.

The Raffle for the Stove 
Written, composed and sung with great success by J. E. M URPHY, 04 
M URPHY k 
M ACK, at the London Variety Theatre, N. Y., in the 
laughable sketch, entitled " Murphy's Dream," tor 100 
consecutive nights. 
Music published and copyright 1879, by E. H. Harding, 299 Bowery, an ,' 
sent to any address, post-paid, on receipt of 35 cents. 
Last Wednesday I 
attended 
A 
raffle for a 
stove, 
In aid of the wife and family 
Of Timothy J. Cosgrove. 
Kellys, Hogans, and O'Briens, 
All came in a 
drove, 
To take the dice and shake them nice, 
And try and win the stove. 
CHORUS. 
Forward four, allaman left, while the music it did play. 
'Twas grand delight to see the sight of those Irishmen so 
gay, 
I 
never laughed so hearty in the course of all my life 
Looking at Plug McCarty, pivotin' with his wife. 
At nine o'clock precisely 
The raffling it begun, 
Tom Kelly he jumped ten foot high 
When sixty-four was flung; 
O'Brien yelled out murder, 
With a 
brick his eye was closed ; 
On that night I 
had to fight, 
While raffling for the stove. 
(Chorus.'; 
At six o'clock in the morning 
The raffling it was o'er, 
Tom Kelly he got staving drunk 
And stole away the door; 
Clancy with a 
bott.e, 
Sure he all the windows broke; 
Cosgrove grabbed him by the neck, 
And boys, I 
thought he'd choke.

THE TURNPIKE GATE. 
As sung by REYNOLDS & W ALLING. 
I 
am thinking of the day when but a 
little child, 
I 
wandered o'er the meadows to the hill, 
Where the sweet flowers grew and forevergrowing wild 
And the stream e'er flowed by the mill. 
But the old mill house has gone to decay, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
And the miller he lies sleeping where the gentle breezes 
blow, 
And we played 'neath the Turnpike gate. 
CHORUS. 
Por the Turnpike gate is the pride of my heart, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
When she sits beside me now, there's a 
smile upon her 
brow, 
That reminds me of the Turnpike gate. 
And the old school-house has gone to decay, 
Where the schoolmaster heard us recite, 
And those happy, happy (lays have faded from our view, 
When our little hearts were filled with delight. 
And when the school was out we would wander to the 
spring, 
here I 
drew for you pictures on your slate, 
And those happy childhood days they'll come again no 
more, 
When we played on the Turnpike gate.

The Two McMullens. 
Original words and music by JonN E. 
M URPHY, and sung by Ntuiti-.Av 
and M ACK. 
We are the two McMullens, 
As ye all do know, 
A 
little Irish dancing 
To ye we're going to show. 
We landed in this country 
just fifteen years ago, 
And for making money 
You bet we are not slow. 
CHORUS. 
It was in the garden I 
met you, darling, 
Where the shamrock grows, 
It was there you stole my heart, dear Barney, 
Just twenty years ago. 
Is that so ? 
It is so. 
Oh yes, it is so. 
Is that so ? 
It is so. 
Oh yes, it is so. 
So now we're going to leave you, 
We bid you all farewell, 
And of us two McMullens 
We hope you will speak well. 
We have to toil and labor 
Our app'es for to sell, 
And when he gets elected 
To you he'll quickly tell. 
It was in the garden, &e.

Behold the breezy vocalists, 
Wid music in both ears, 
And when we warble our sweet song,

To purchase all the latest snaps, 
For the Murphy Sangerbund.

Then hear the melody grand, we roar, 
They say we have broken the heart of Gilmore, 
For style—could any wish for more, 
When we sing our little tra-la-la-la, 
Tra-la-la-lay, tra-la-la-lum-tum, 
When we sing our tra-la-la-lee, 
In the Murphy Sangerbund. 
We rub our voices wid bay- rum, 
To make them strong and tough, 
And when we all sing for-tay, 
Why on weak tin ears it's rough. 
We sing " Grandfather's on our block," 
And " In the Sweet by-bye," 
Wid such wild sweetness, that you'd love 
To lie you down and die. 
Then hear the melody, &c.

The Wild Irish Rovers. 
Original, by M URPHY and M ACK. 
We've just come down here for to sing you a 
song, 
And we tell you we're not going to keep you too long ; 
If you think that we are, you'll see that's where you're 
wrong, 
For we have to go home in the morning. 
My name is Tim Doolan—and my name is Pat, 
If you want to see dancing, jast stand out of that ; 
We're both Irish boys, from the crowns of our hats, 
And old Ireland is the land we were born in. 
CHORUS. 
.or we're the boys the shillelah to whack. ( Break.) 
All over Cork county, to Limerick and back, 
We're known as the wild Irish rovers. 
We traveled to Connaught, from that to Tyrone, 
And we walked all the way to the bridge of Athlone; 
Through Dublin and Kerry and Wexford alone, 
We roamed all around through the clover. 
We sailed over to France, from that into Spain, 
And we're going to America by the next train ; 
So we'll bid you good-bye, but we'll come back again, 
And we'll still be the wild Irish rovers. 
For we're the boys, &c.

The Way We March. 
Original words and music by Joirri E. M URPHY, and sung by M VPH1 
and M ACK. 
Good-evening to you, one and all, 
We ask your kind attention ; 
The subject of our song ' tis one 
To you all now we'll make mention. 
It's about a 
day that's not far away, 
Though it comes but once a 
year, 
That's the time we'll all feel gay, 
On St. Patrick's Day in the morning. 
CHORUS. 
The bands will play, and the fifes will play, 
As down Broadway we'll march away ; 
That's the time we'll all feel gay, 
On St. Patrick's Day in the morning. 
Now if on that day we should meet, 
We hope you won't get offended, 
For what we say and do that day 
It never was intended. 
When we march out we know what we're about, 
That's the time the boys will shout; 
And before it's night we are kicked out 
Of the barrooms in the city. 
The bands will play, &c. 
We learned our marching in the war, 
We fought with George McClellan; 
We was high private in the rear, 
This is the truth we're telling. 
And when we're out upon parade, 
We throw all others in the shade; 
We march along in the Fenian Brigade, 
On St. Patrick's Day in the morning.

Oh how sadly I

You will never die alone, 
Because I'll never squeal. 
Good-bye, Jakey, 
Good-bye, mother, sister, brother, 
To this world we bid adieu, 
Do not know us, but disown us, 
We throw no shade on you. 
If we had done as you adviscd us, 
From bad company staid away. 
Do not cry, we now must die, 
For us we hope you'll pray.

GOING WEST TO DIE. 
Composed and recited by NELLIE GEamos, America's Classic 
Recitationist. 
Well, here we are, my dear old wife, 
On board the train at last, 
Our little all packed in a 
trunk 
With lock and strap made fast; 
I 
hear the bell a 
ringin', 
And the whistle's piercing cry. 
There, wife, we're moving out of town, 
Were going West to die. 
We've been from Jane's to John's house, 
From John's house back to Jane's, 
'Till now- they've laid our burden down 
On board the Western train; 
'Tis rather hard to send us off, 
All crippled up and gray, 
To find a 
place in which to die, 
Two thousand miles away. 
Since we broke up a 
keeping house, 
They ve carted us around, 
'Till now it seems on earth for us 
A home cannot be found; 
As sure as this old face of mine 
Can ne'er look young again, 
So sure we'll never more return 
To trouble John and Jane. 
They send us to a 
stranger land, 
O'er an untraveled road, 
That Mary, in her Western home 
May bear the heavy load; 
It isn't to be wondered at 
That my eyes are tilled with tears, 
Or that my form is bending down 
With more than weight of years. 
dilu't think twould come to this, 
I 
didn't mean it should; 
.So home is like your own home, 
Though made of logs and wood! 
GOING WEST TO DIE. — CoNTINuE,D.: 
No bread is sweet when eaten 
Mal bitterness and strife, 
Few care to till with peace and love 
An old man's closing life, 
:Now, o'er a 
long untraveled road 
We seek a 
stranger hand, 
The old home circle broken up 
At cruel time's command; 
But they cannot Our love destrcy, 
'Ili stronger now than when 
Our heads wore not the silver locks 
Of three score years and ten. 
Since we've broke up a 
keeping house 
We've led a 
wretched life, 
Jane put the blame upon her man, 
And John upon his wife; 
Th -.J. 
think not of their infancy, 
Of all those teilder years 
When night and day we toiled for them

We leave behind us all the scenes 
Of early year, dear wife,

The victories of life; 
Are te tve behiul the little church 
Where oft we've knelt, in prayer, 
But, good wife, we'll never leave

LITTLE JIM. 
—: 0: 
Recited with great 6occess by the Original Lady Reeitationist, 
NELLIE GERMON 
--: 0 :--
The cottage was a 
thatched one, the ou:side old and mean. 
Yet everything within that cot was wondrous neat and 
clean; 
The night was dark and stormy, the winds were how1h.g 
wild, 
When a. patient mother Ivatched beside the death- IAA of 
her child. 
A 
little worn-out creature, his once bright eyes grown dim. 
It was a 
Collier's only child, they called him Little Jim, 
And oh! to see the briny tears fast hurrying down her 
cheek, 
.A.s she offered up a 
prayer in thought she was afraid to 
speak; 
Lest she might weaken one she loveA far dearer than her 
life, 
For slte had all a 
mother's heart had that poor Collier's 
wife. 
With hands will tet!, see she kneel, beside the sufferer's 
bed, 
And prays i 
hit ( hAt :! i 
spare the boy, and take herself 
instead; 
LITTLE JIM.—CosTiNVED. 
She gets an answer from the child, soft fall these words 
from him, 
Mother, the angels do so smile, and beckon Little Jim. 
I 
have no pain, dear mother, now, but oh! I 
am so dry, 
Just moisten poor Jim's lips again, and mother, don't you 
cry; 
With gentle, trembling haste, she held a 
tea-cup to his lips, 
lie smiled to thank her, as he took three little tiny sips; 
Tell father when he comes from work, I 
bid good-night to 
lam, 
And, mother, now I'll go to sleep, alas! poor Little Jim. 
She felt that all was over, that the child she loved so dear, 
Had uttered the last words that she had ever hoped to hear; 
The cottage door was opened, the Collier's step was heard, 
The father and the mother meet, yet never speak a 
word. 
Ile takes the candle in his hand, and walks towards the 
bed, 
iIis quivering lip gives token that the child he loved was 
dead; 
With heads bowed down with sorrow, they humbly ask of 
Hint, 
In Heaven, once more to meet again their own poor Little 
Jim.

Never go Back on an Old_Friend in Need. 
Written by Wm. DEVERE, expressly for NELLIE GER:110N, and recited 
by her hi all the principal theatres. 
0: -
Since apothegms now have become all the fashion, 
There's one I've selected and studied with care; 
it is not philosophic, it doesn't sound dashing, 
But it nurtures the gem of affection so rare. 
Let misanthropes sneer and philosophers argue, 
But keep to the right as you travel life's pathway, 
And never go back on an old friend in need. 
Ills clothes may be tattered, his hands hard and hora) , 
You know that he's honest and true to the core, 
Life's pathway to him may be troubled and thorny, 
While sycophants pass him and know him no more, 
But grasp his rough hand with an honest affection, 
Dispelling the clouds where his duty may lead 
And wealth couldn't purchase that sweet recollection, 
Ah! never go back 011 an old friend in need. 
There may come a 
time when adversity's ocean 
Will roll its dark waves o'er your sorrowing head, 
When sunbeams of hope are engulfed in commotion, 
And life's dearest objects seem withered and dead, 
But Bethlehem's star shall arise in its glory, 
Great hearts and strong hands shall be with you i/tiecil 
Go read in the Bible that wondrous old story, 
And never go back on an old friend in need. 
All honor to him who in right never falters, 
Who offers his friendship, his heart in his hand, 
Whose judgment no they sayer ever can alter, 
lie is worthy to be the first judge in the land. 
And when he shall pass from this world to another, 
Write in letters of gold that all who run may read ,

To see us how they run.

The Blackwell Ex-Isles, 
COMIC SKETCH. 
BY SAUL SERTREW. 
CHARACTERS. 
SANDY. 
CORNELIUS. 
SCENE— Street. 
H ew of a 
pawnbroker's house. 
Three 
balls hanging over the door, and sign marked " Simpson." 
Enter SANDY, clothed in rags. 
(Looks up at house.)— Here have I 
anchored at last. 
To 
Simpson's have I come. 
An exile from Blackwell's Isle. 
Yes, they drove me from its palatial mansions. 
There's not 
even standing room. 
The people are hanging to the water-
spout, and I 
have come here to Simpson's to see if I 
can 
spout myself. ( Looks at his clothes.) 
I 
can't raise anything 
on these garments—(surprised)—garments, did I 
say! 
Gar-
bage, I 
should have said. (Looks at house.) 
Oh! if Simpson 
would loan me something on myself! I 
will, I 
will appeal 
to him, and if he does not hear my appeal, I 
will carry my 
case to the Court of Appeals. (Goes to door of pawnbroker's 
house and sings) : 
"TAKE ME , 
SIMPSON ." 
Ara : " Take this Letter to M y 
Mother." 
Take me Simpson, take me darling, 
Loan me something on myself; 
Fold me in my linen duster, 
Throw me up upon the shelf. 
For the times they are so poorly, 
Nothing can I 
get to do; 
I've been chewing my suspenders 
Till my teeth are black and blue. 
CHORUS. 
Take me, Simpson, take me, darling, 
Loan me something on myself; 
38 
Fold me in my linen duster, 
Hang me up upon the shelf. 
LComes forward. 
Where, oh, where's my rich relations, 
Where's the friends I 
used to know; 
Where's the Judge that gave me six months, 
Whyfore don't he do so now ? 
Once I 
was a 
Gladiator, 
In the Ring I 
had a " pull ;" 
Now they hang me out the window 
When the station-house is full. 
Take me, Simpson, &c. 
One of Me balls drops from over the door. SANDY discovers 
the ball. 
Ah ! what is this I 
see before me—a 
snowball? ( Picks up 
ball.) 
No ! it's one of Simpson's ten-pin balls that has fallen 
from over his alley door. 
Yes, this ball has heard me bawl-
ing, and " dropt on it." (Examines ball and soliloquizes.) 
Ah, this ball. 
I 
knew it well, Horatio Simpson. 
0, how 
many times I 
have played ten-pins and made a 
ten strike 
with that ball ! 
Ah, those good times are past. 
You might 
put this ball in a 
cannon now and shoot it off, and you 
wouldn't hit anything. (Smooths bail with his hand.) 
To 
what base use some things do cotne : 
This ball, now so 
baldheaded, must have met with many hairbreadth escapes. 
Perchance this ball may have dangled from the ear of some 
belle of the ball, and now has become the emblem of a 
pawn-
broker, and playing three-card monte-over his door while he 
is throwing dice inside, 
I 
will take this ball into Simpson's, 
and tell him it's a 
paradice lost and I 
have found it. 
Tho' I 
may he batted and bounced out, upon this ball I 
will pitch:my 
[Exit through door of pawnbroker's house. 
Enter CORNELIUS, clothed in rags, and sings 
"BETTER DAYS." 
AIR: " Slavery Days." 
I 
am thinking of those days, those bright and happy days, 
When I 
had friends and money at command; 
29 
And a 
golden watch and chain, which I'll never see again, 
And those clothes I 
used to wear so fine and grand. 
Those happy days are past; misfortune came at last, 
And I'm broken down and " nary" cent can raise; 
And the friends I 
used to know they go back upon me now, 
But it wasn't so when I 
saw better days. 
CHORUS. 
I 
hope they'll come again—let my hopes be not in vain— 
And people will return to honest ways ; 
Then subjects like me now wouldn't go about, you know, 
And I 
think we all would see much better days. 
I 
have lined on that roast beef—oh, so tender to the teeth, 
In those happy days when I 
had lots of cash: 
But you'd be surprised to know—oh, how quick I'd get just 
now 
On the outside of a 
ten cent plate of hash. 
That dream to me is o'er. 
Roast beef I 
have no more ; 
My clothes are rags ; I've lost my stylish ways; 
On my uppers now I 
walk, and so hungry I 
can't talk, 
But there was a 
time when I 
saw better days. 
I 
hope they'll come again, &c. 
(Looks toward pawnbroker's house.)—Here have I 
come at 
last, to Simpson's, the pawnbroker. An exile from Coney 
Isle, they drove me from its sandy shore, and my sands of life 
are most run out. 
I 
have roamed the streets all through, and 
went through everybody I 
could, but no one had a 
cent. 
There has nothing entered my stomach for the past six 
months but the fumes of a 
restaurant that I 
inhaled while 
looking in the window. 
Oh, this is awful! (Feels of his 
stomach.) 
To think that I 
should have come to this; I 
who 
never knew what it was to be without a 
dollar in my pocket, 
that didn't belong to somebody else. 
Oh, if I 
could move the 
heart of thi , pawnbroker and get him to loan me something 
on myself! (Goes to pawnbroker's house and peers in the 
window, and makes motions as if catching f:ies from the side 
of the house, and, throwing them in his month suddenly, feels 
of his stomach. 
Puts hand to his hotel 
i! sick, and Leans 
against side of house) as 
40 
Enter SANDY, with tall in his hand. 
I 
have seen Simpson, and he loaned me a 
fish hall, and 
told me to keep this ball to remind me of my obligation. 
Yes, the sacrifice was awful. 
I 
have pawned myself to Simp-
son, and when the hour of ten minutes expires I 
am a 
doomed 
man ! (Discovers Cornelius.) 
Ah, who have we here? 
(Goes to Cornelius and slaps him on the shoulder.) 
Why this 
Moodyness and Sankeyness? 
CORNELIUS (turns and recognizes Sandy)—Hello! Sandy, 
old boy, is that you ? 
SANDY—Yes, it is all that is left of me ; and the balance 
will belong to Simpson in a 
few minutes. 
CORNELIUS (surprised)—Whyfore this emotion from an old 
Castilian and brother convict ? 
What is the matter ? 
What 
are yo--. doing around here ? 
SANDY— I've just been getting a 
loan on myself from E;imp-
son. 
I 
didn't think it safe to be alone any longer. 
CORNELIUS (amazed)—A loan on yourself! 
Why, you 
don't mean to say that you have been spouting yourself— 
given yourself in pledge! 
Well, what did you get on this 
valuable casket (turns Sandy around.) 
Six months ? 
SANDY—No; I 
got one fish ball without bread. 
They 
don't give bread with one fish ball, and I 
have devoured the 
fish ball. 
CORNELIUS—And what security did you give ? 
SANDY—I 
am to give myself up- to Simpson in ten minutes. 
CORNELIUS—What for ? 
SANDY—To be used as a 
door-mat, for people to wipe their 
muddy shoes on. 
Yes ; when the bell tolls the hour of ten 
minutes I 
am a 
doomed man. My arms and legs are to be 
cut off, and my body used as a 
door-mat. 
CORNELIUS (horrified)—Gracious hevvings! you don't say 
so ! 
Well, I 
don't think I 
will try to get a 
loan on myself. 
I'll leave Simpson alone. 
He might want me for a mop to 
wipe up the floor. 
SANDY (in despair)- 0h, this is dreadful ! 
But I 
wouldn't 
41 
care so much about it if I 
could only see my mother-in-law 
before I 
part this life. 
CORNELIUS—Your mother-in-law! What do you want to 
see her for ? 
SANDY—She owes me two dollars and a 
half, and I 
want 
to get it. 
CORNELIUS—What are you going to do with it ? 
You can't 
take it with you. 
SANDY—I 
thought I 
would leave it to build a " hotel for 
wealthy women, and not charge them anything for board." 
CORNELIUS—Oh, you might better leave the two dollars 
and a 
half to me. 
I'm an old friend of yours and a 
brother 
exile and Castilian. 
SANDY (starts)—Aye, that's so. 
A thought strikes me. 
You just hold this ball, and I 
will depart at once for my 
mother-in-law's castle and get the two dollars and a 
half and 
return before the hour of my execution and give it to you. 
(Hands ball to Cornelius.) 
Watch over this ball, and guard 
it with your life. 
CORNELIUS (takes ball)—I 
will, my noble duke. 
So haste 
away. 
Not a 
moment is to be lost, and I 
will hold the fort 
till you return. 
So hurry up and bring me the two dollars 
and a 
half. 
SANDY—'Tis well, my noble Pythias. 
I 
fly! 
I 
fly! 
Shoo, 
fly! [Exit, stamping off. 
Changes to the character of Shylock, the yew. 
CORNELIUS (very happy, dances about in glee, and tosses 
up the ball and catches it.)— I, golly, I'm to be left a 
fortune 
of two dollars and a 
half! 
Oh, my; won't I 
be a sport— 
won't I 
be a 
thoroughbred! 
A loud noise of a 
gong is heard in doleful sounds, struck at 
intervals, ten times. 
CORNELIUS (
frightened, moves fright wig up and down)— 
Ah! what is that I 
hear ? 
Oh, what have I 
done ? I 
see it 
all! 
Yes, I 
have put myself in his place ! 
I 
have taken the 
place of Sandy, and that Shylock will come for his pound of 
43 
42 
flesh, and I 
am lost! 
I'm a 
doomed man! The bell ;mils 
the hour of ten minutes, and I 
am lost !- Oh, hevvings, why 
didn't I 
think of this before! 
What is to be done ? 
If I 
run 
away they will set the bloodhounds on me and I 
would be 
devoured ! (Runs about working his fright wig. 
Stops sud-
denly) as 
Enter SANDY, disguised as Skylock. 
(Has a 
large tin sword in his hand, scrapes it on the floor, 
as if to sharpen it.)—I 
want me pound of flesh! I 
want me 
bond ! I 
want me door- mat ! (Scrapes sword on the floor.) 
CORNELIUS (trembling and shaking with fright)-0h, it 
wasn't me ! 
I 
didn't do it ! 
It was another fellow! 
He's 
gone to see his mother-in-law! 
He's coming right back ! 
0, spare me, good Shylock, and I'll never do so again. ( Falls 
on his knees.) 
SHYLOCK— II 
is too late; the hour is passed, and thou at 
a 
doomed man, and nothing can save thee. 
I 
shall hang thee 
first, and then cut thy arms and legs off, and use thy body for 
a 
door-mat ! 
What, ho ! guards without, seize the victim. 
(A man enters, puts a 
bag over Cornelius' head, and leads 
him off, followed by Shylock, saying): I 
want me pound of 
flesh ! 
I want me bond! I want me door-mat! (Loud 
noise and murmuring heard outside) as 
Enter SANDY, in his original dress, with a 
big carving-knife. 
(Stamping and rushing in for Cornelius)-0h, Cornelius, 
Cornelius, where art thou ? 
Can it be that I am too late to 
save him ! Oh, could I 
but save my friend Cornelius! (Runs 
about, looking up and down.) 
Where, oh, where is he! (A 
dummy man hanging from a 
rope swings from the flies to the 
center of stage. 
Sandy discovers it. 
Noise and confusion 
still goes on outside.) 
Ah ! what is this I 
see before me—a 
dadger? 
No! Yes ; it is my friend Cornelius ! and, by all 
the dogs, I 
will save him, come what may. (Jumps up and 
cuts the dummy down with his knife. 
A 
pistol shot is heard. 
Sandy grabs the dummy and runs off crying—Saved! Saved 
He is saved !)

Smack their lips and say, 
We'd die for the want of a

Forty-five cent switches on their heads, no stockings

But there is one little snap I

That is, see that my grave is whitewashed every summer.

Oh, the days will come to your poison face.

ever kicked. 
I

Stitt my mem'ry will steal o'er 
To dat dear old Cabin floor, 
When de shadow of de sun came peeping in; 
At night, when all was dark, 
We would hear de watch-dog bark, 
And we'd listen to the murmur of the wind. 
It seem to say to me. 
“You people must be free," 
For de happy time am coming. Lord be praised! 
For then we would weep and moan, 
For our souls was not our our own, 
in dent agonizing, cruel slav'ry days. 
3 I 
am very old and feeble, 
And our We am nearly done; 
I 
have travell'd in the roughest kind of road; 
Through sicknt\ss, toil and sorrow 
I 
have reach' de end at last, 
And I'm resting by de wayside wid my load. 
Forget now trod forgive. 
Ilas always been my guide, 
For dat's what de scripture surely says; 
But our inem'ry will turn roun, 
When our souls dey were tied down, 
In dent agonizing„vuel slav'ry days,

If you ask for some amusement, 
Why just come with me to-day, 
We'll walk along Pacific Street, 
Down towards the Bay; 
Such sights for you will there be found, 
But nothing that will shock; 
You'll laugh your sides to splinters at 
The Sheenies on our block. 
There's the Cohens and the Lowens, 
From old Jerusalem, 
There's the Keysers and the Peysers 
From salt-fish Amsterdam; 
Of all the second-handed brokers 
They keep the finest stock, 
They've horrible pugs, and oh, what mugs, 
These Sheenies on our block. 
CHORUS: 
Little Mosey Gumplestein, 
Sitting in the sun; 
Laughing, shouting, 
For any kind of fun, 
use, Mosey, rise, 
Wipe your nose off with your sock; 
And when you're big, you'll represent 
The Sheenies on our block. 
THE SHEENIES ON OUR BLOCIC—CONTINUE.D. 
If you're in for speculation, 
Why that's the place to go; 
You'll find the greatest bargains, 
They've everything to show. 
From boots and shoes, coats and pants, 
To a 
rusty key and lock, 
Business is always tremendous with 
The Sheenies on our block. 
There's the Lesynskys, and Greezynkys 
From Poland far away, 
'the Jacobs and the Josephs 
From Germany a 
day. 
They came in ' 49, 
Regular old time rocks; 
The town's a 
curiosity with 
The Sheenies on our block. 
There is Solomon Isaac Levy, 
Who learned the Tailor trade; 
He has the largest family, 
The youngest just a 
babe. 
Twenty-one girls, two dozen boys, 
They live on the smell of hock; 
They're the rising generation of 
The Sheenies on our block. 
There's the Meyers, and the Mayers, 
They've got their business down; 
The Schlosses, and the Grosses, 
Who are so fat and sound. 
You can get just what you want there, 
Even old Granny's clock; 
Such enterprising colonists are

Oh one evening lately, I 
dressed up nately, 
I 
put on my Sunday clothes, plug- hat and all; 
And I

Going round a

You can't go behind me, says I, now mind me, 
If you stand forenint me I 
can bate ye all. 
The— the gang did face me and thought to lace me, 
But I 
showed them tricks I 
learned at Donegal; 
Right and left I 
pounded, they were dumbfounded, 
And at last for mercy they began to bawl.

TORPEDO AND THE WHALE. 
As sung by LESTER & W ILLIAMS. 
—:o:— 
In our back yard there lives two bums, 
They can dance upon their gums; 
They never had no thumbs, 
And with Ben Butler they were chums. 
Chouus: 
Oh, they are crazy and lazy, 
Garfield and Hazey; 
They are gentlemen of rank, 
Cage them up in sonic big tank, 
And we'll let them rob some bank, 
Then bite off their nose. 
In our back alley lives a 
cat, 
And her maiden name is Pat; 
She could sleep in an old hat, 
And in a 
butcher's she eats fat. 
In our back alley lives a 
guy, 
And he never told a 
lie; 
He is not afraid to die, 
And he makes his living stealing pie. 
Chorus. 
(Chorus) 
They ain't pleasing, they are teasing, 
Like lemons they need squeezing, 
lie's got warts upon his nose, 
He never wore no clothes, 
He never sleeps, he'd al ways doze, 
And wash himself in soup.

WHOA, EMMA 1 
As originally sung with tremendous success throughout the 
United States by the Duncan Sisters, 
CARRIE AND SOPHIE. 
M Y 
beau took me, one day, sailing down the bay. 
He called me his dear Emma. That's my name. 
While standing on the pier some chaps began to stare, 
And one and all around us did exclaim: 
ClIORUS. 
Oh, Emma! Whoa, Emma! 
Emma, you put me in such a 
dilemma! 
Oh, Emma! Who, Emma! 
That's what I 
hear wherever I 
go. 
I 
asked them what they meant, when some one at us sent 
An egg, which struck my beau right in the eye! 
then began to scream, " Oh, Fred-, what does this mean?" 
I 
asked again, and this was their reply: 
Oh, Emma! Who, Emma! etc. 
I 
thought they'd never cease. 
We shouted out police! 
And when he came he looked at us so sly; 
He said " Don't be put out—it's only a 
saying that's got 
about," 
And then their voices seemed to rend the sky. 
SPOKEN.—You see, this is the latest New York byword, 
" 
Oh, Emma!" and we didn't know that. 
So they all 
commenced together again, including the policeman— 
Oh, Emma! Whoa, Emma! etc. 
Why Don't You Carry a 
Hod? 
Written by BURT. W AYNE, and Dedicated to all Irish 
Singers. 
Ai.—" Sally Bless ify Soul." 
I 
should like to know the reason why, 
Who gave my girl a 
big black eye! 
She blinks and squints, begins to cry 
Whenever I 
pass her by. 
I 
met her again this afternoon, 
While walking down Broadway. 
Her face looked like a 
sick Babboou 
Now this is what she did say: 
CHORUS. 
You're too fresh, please take a 
walk 
You're no better than a 
fraud. 
She said N. G., tra-la-lee! 
Why don't you carry the hod? 
She throws on style, with her pull-back dress, 
Gives me conundrums for to guess! 
Her love for me she don't confess, 
Which leaves me in distress. 
She said I 
was a 
happy man, 
A 
second Buffalo Bill! 
Go get a 
rope and try your strength 
To pull a 
cow up hill! 
My Old Kentucky Home, Good-Night. 
Ite'41c, with Piano Forte Accompaniment, published by Mewls. Firth 
Pond & Co., New York. 
THE sun shines bright in the old Kentucky home; 
'Tin summer, the darkies are gay, 
The corn-top's ripe and the meadows in the bloom, 
While the birds make music music all the day. 
The young folks roll on the little cabin floor, 
All merry, all happy and bright; 
By-' n-by hard times comes a-knocking at the door— 
Then my old Kentucky home, far away. 
CHORUS. 
Weep no more, my lady, 
Oh! weep no more to- day; 
We will sing one song for the old Kentucky home. 
For the old Kentucky home, far away. 
They hunt no more for the possum and the coon 
On the meadow, the hill, and the shore: 
They sing no more by the glimmer of the moon, 
On the bench by the old cabin door. 
The day goes by like a 
shadow o'er the heart, 
With sorrow where all was delight, 
The time has come when the derides have to part, 
Then my old Kentucky home, good-night. 
Weep no more, Sr.c. 
The head must bow and the back will have to bend, 
Wherever the darkey may go; 
A 
few more days and the trouble all will end 
In the field where the sugar canes grow; 
A 
few more days for to tote the weary load— 
No matter, ' twill never be light; 
A 
few more days till we totter on the road, 
Then my old Kentucky home, good- night 
Weep no more, 4,.c„, 
60: 
Mr. Johnny Dougherty, 
written and sung by HENRY CARNEY, with marked success at Tony Pol. 
tor's Theatre, New York. 
You've all heard of the solid men, 
And men of great renown; 
But if you'll listen for awhile 
I'm certain you will own 
That I'm the most respected man 
In this great town; and why? 
It is because when I 
walk out 
You will hear the people cry—. 
CHORUS. 
I'm Mr. Johnny Dougherty, the tailor 
A 
man of great renown ; 
And everybody knows that to make a 
suit of clothes 
I'm the very best you'll find in all the town. 
I've heard them say a 
tailor is 
The ninth part of a.man ; 
Let them get up and knock me 
Into nine parts if they can. 
Devil a 
one would ever dare 
To box me for a 
foe, 
For I 
can box as well as stitch. 
As very well they know. 
I'm Mr. Johnny Dougherty, &c,

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means ot 
expressing one's sentiments in such a 
way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse to venture upon asking th e momentous, 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to he an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the came as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation mi. 
necessary. 
The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players ; 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

leading New York Papers say of it. 
The N. Y. Evening iIail writes: 
" 
A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. FISHER'S, No. 24 
Vesey Street, called the 
Little Flirt." We cannot say that we recom-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would 
only encourage the had habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunatly, there is 
enough of it done without any further necessity of explaining "how, 
when and where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initi-
ate the uncorrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a 
neat little 
book, bound in Nlorrocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt." published by A. J. 
FISHER, No. 24 Vesey Street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi otRirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might 
afford some innocent amusement. to many, we do not hesitate to recorn. 
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."

Napoleon's Oraculum.—A Verhatint Copy of the Lou. 
don edition (originally published at the price of $ 5,00), which professes 
to be a 
perfect Inc simile of the one used by N APOLEON, and consulted 
by him on every important occasion. 
Happy had it been for him had he 
abided by, or been ruled by the answers of' this Oracle. No further lib-
erties have been taken in the translation, than merely to adapt it to the 
usages of this country. The questions being more numerous, and the 
answers more diversified than any edition ever before published in 
the United States, renders it much more valuable and interesting than 
any mutilated copy can possibly be.

adapted to all conditions of life; and persons of both sexes, whatever 
their situation or capacity, may with confidence refer to its pages to 
derive information, and for the purpose of regulating their future con-
duct, according to its Oracular Counsels
