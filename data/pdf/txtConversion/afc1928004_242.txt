THE HEN CONVENTION. 
A FAMOM Hen Convention 
Was held in Humbug Green— 
Such a 
show of fuss and feathers 
Ne'er before was seen; 
With Malays, Bantams, Chitagongs, 
And game-fowls, fine and tall; 
But Mr. Rooster Shanghai 
Cut the biggest swell of all. 
CHORUS. 
It was cackle, cackle, cackle, cackle, 
Flap your wine.s 
and crow, 
And Shanghai shanged the highest 
At the Hen Convention Show. 
Says Malay, pulling out his gills, 
" 
I'm the fairest fowl," 
Says Bantam, "You're a 
hen-pecked race— 
Hen-hearted, with no soul." 
Says Shangai, " You poor Bantams 
Are a 
race of chicken toys," 
Says Bantam, " If you peck at me 
You'll find I'm one of ie boys." 
It was cackle, &c: 
A 
Poultry duel earn() on straight— 
'Twas Bantam and Shanghai: 
A 
crow at first, and then a 
clip, 
And then the feathers fly. 
Young Bantam spurred him flat 
Amid a 
loud convention crow; 
And Shanghai shanged the lowest 
At the great Convention show, 
It was cackle, &c.

PAT O'BRIEN. 
PAT O'BRrEN is my name, I'll tell you, boys, from where I 
came. 
Ould Ireland is the place I 
claim, and I 
am an Irish boy, 
No country is so dear to me as the little isle stands near the 
sea, 
Where all the boys are blithe and free, deny it if you can. 
Ould Ireland is the place where they're famed for fan and mirth, 
Its equal can't be found if you search all o'er the earth: 
Good natured boys and girls are there, with none of them you 
can compare, 
Where every heart is free from care, that makes an Irish boy. 
CHORUS, 
Pat O'Brien is my name I'll tell you boys, from where I 
came, 
Ould Ireland is the place I 
claim, and I 
am an Irish boy. 
Dan O'Connell, ould Ireland's friend, he struggled hard for to 
deLnd, 
'Gainst all invaders who did intend to claim poor Paddy's land; 
He advocated Ireland's right with all his main and all his might, 
And he was poorly recompensed for all his toil and pains, 
in high courts of justice he caused them all to stare: 
With his knowledge, wit, and humor, to hear him it was rare; 
He always proved poor Paddy's friend when on his trial he did 
attend, 
He caused the noblest back to bend to the honest Irishman. 
Pat O'Brien is my name, A:c. 
In eighteen forty-four gone by, out countrymen they had to fly 
For, famine stared in every eye along ould Ireland's shore; 
They to America did sail, leaving their wives and babies to wail; 
They were determined not to fail, but l'neir hardships to endure: 
The harp that once through Tara's Halls, shall strike each cord 
again 
To welcome back those exiles from across the raging main. 
May peace and plenty ever be to our little Isle that stands near 
the sea 
And all our toasts be: Ireland free 
and you'll be happy then.

THE BUGABOO. 
As sung by-JERIIT tiAnairtuTON'. 
Music published by E. II. Ear& 
bag, 288 Bowery. 
COME all you tender-hearted boys, wherever you may be, 
And I'll tell you of the dangers upon the dark blue sea, 
Of the dangers and the hardships, my boys, that I 
went 
through,* 
When I 
shipped as co* and steward my boys, on board of 
the Bugaboo. 
E*Repeat 
The day when first I 
joined her she lay in James street canal ; 
She was large and stout and beautiful—forget her shape I 
never shall, 
The captain wore a 
large straw hat, knee breeches and a 
body 
coat so blue,* 
Arrah, boys, he'd made a 
fine figurehead, for to ornament the 
Bugaboo. 
(* Repeat, 
We soon weighed anchor and set sail to plow' the raging surf, 
We were bound for the bog of Allan to get a 
load of turf. 
We sailed until we pissed the back of Richmond barracks so 
trne,* 
'When the gallant 84th fired a 
royal salute of bricks at the Cap-
tain of the Bugaboo. 
[*Repeat. 
10 
We sailed three years when a 
storm arose, and the sea ran 
mountain high, 
The thunder rolled, the lightning flashed and lit the dark 
blue sky, 
So the second mate gave orders to lower the sails and clew,* 
While the captain down below was smoking in his bed—be 
set fire to the Bugaboo. 
r 
Repeat. 
When the ;rtptain found what he had done, he loud for help 
did shout, 
He called up through the chimney top for the helmsman to 
come and put it out: 
But the helmsman was fast asleep, and to his post untrue,* 
And the fire burned so hard through the middle of the turf, 
they could'nt save the Bugaboo. 
Repeat. 
When fifteen thousand miles from land in latitude fifty-four, 
The fire it burned so hard one night, that it could'nt burn 
anymore; 
So the captain he gave orders to 1Dwer the boats and save the 
crew,* 
While a 
1,000 rods of turf and 50,000 men were smothered in 
tha Bugaboo. 
L*Repeat. 
'BEAITTIrtiL LOVE. 
As sung by GEORGE H ARRIS, the English Comique. 
LOVE, love, Oh, what is love, ' tis that makes man feel so pe-
culiar; 
Oh, love, who does not love a 
Maud. :a 
Matilda, a 
Jane or a 
Julia ? 
• 
Love it is, and love alone, that makes the world go round and 
round, 
Love is certain to be known, where a 
woman's to be found, 
When one has the first attack it's like rasperry jam, running 
down one's back. 
CHORUS. 
Ii, love, beautiful love, love it is that makes a 
man feel so pe-
culiar. 
Oh, love, beautiful love, a 
man's but a 
fool when he falls in 
love. 
Oh love, when you're in love, to presents, to parties and pic-
nics you treat her, 
Oh love, just squeeze her glove, and you feel as though you'd 
like to eat her; 
But the best of loves must part, then an end comes to your 
bliss, 
You press the dear one to your heart and take from her the 
parting kiss, 
Yon bid her good-bye at the door with another sly kiss and two 
or three more. 
•Oh, love, ex" ) 
x". 
13 
Oh love, when you're in love every half hour you'd go to court 
her. 
But Oh, love, if she won't love, you talk about drowning your-
self in cold water ; 
If it's all right she'll girrale and say please ask father if r 
may, 
Then you feel so jolly and gay, and tease her till she names the 
clay, 
You'll serenade her when she's abed and her dad drops flower-
pots on your head. 
Oh love, &c. 
Oh love, when you've your love out, all the money you have 
you must ladle, 
Servants, dresses, parties, and balls, perhaps each year a 
cherub 
to lay in the cradle. 
When the honeymoon is past then your eyes are not so blind, 
Your dream was far too good to last and your face grows long 
to find, 
Your looked for happiness begins with a mother-
in-law and 
beatiful twins, 
Oh love, dx, 
Funny when you Feel iiiht Way. 
The original Copy of this song was given to Johnny 1Zweb by 
George Harris, the great Engl:6 1

sha'n't forget how queer I 
felt-when lust I 
tell in love, 
I 
had a 
most severe attack through .Airieezing a 
lady's glove. 
Her lovely hand was in it as I 
danced with her so gay, 
I 
thought myself ha paradise—it's funny when you feel that 
way. 
Ctiont:s. 
I 
felt as tho' I'd tumbled into honey, and some one had left me 
all their money. 
The feeling's so peculiar and funny, its funny when you feel 
that way. 
I 
took her down to supper, and sat down by her side, 
I 
helped her to the nices, and filled her glass• with pride, 
In fact paid such attention, that she viewed me with dismay,. 
I 
moved my chair so close to hers, it's funny when you feel that 
way. 
I 
felt as though & c. 
We met again one afternoon, and as we were alone, 
I 
plucked up nerve to ask her if some day she'd be my own ; 
She blushed and said go see papa and ask him if I 
may, 
I 
danced the cancan round the room, it's funny when you feel 
that way. 
I 
felt as though tVc. 
The old man said that we might wed and so ho crowned ow 
bliss, 
And I 
shall be a 
married man in about a 
month from this. 
It seems as though the time, somehow, would never pass o.waj 
I 
loug to hear those wedding bells, 
it, s 
funny when you feel 
that way. 
I 
feel as though & c. 
DARLING BESSIE OF THE LEA. 
As sung by John Nolan, the pleasing tenor. 
OH! I 
wander 'mid the roses in the golden summer time, 
And listen to the streamlet while it rings a 
merry chime, 
But far sweeter than the roses and the streamlet unto me, 
Is the sunlight face of Bessie, darling Bessie of the lea. 
CHOEIIE. 
She is the fairest flower ever sent to comfort me, 
Pure and gentle as an angel. darling Bessie of the lea, 
Yes, she is the fairest flower ever sent to comfort me, 
She is my star and treasure, darling Bessie of the lea, 
Not a 
bird in the wild wood but will answer to her call, 
Oh ! most I 
love the twilight when the pearly (1
,
2w-drops fall, 
Then she meets me in the valley and she kindly welcomes me, 
My bonnie star of evening, darling Bessie of the lea, 
She is, &e. 
Oh ! the honey bee may linger where the buds alai blossoms 
grow, 
The gentle breeze of summer in its fragrance come and go, 
But they all will pass unheeded, for wherever she may be, 
My heart is full of Bessie, darling Bessie of the lea. 
She is, &c.

THE OLD KITCHEN FLOOR, 
Stag by En. BURTON. 
FAR back in my musings my thoughts have been cast, 
To the cot where the hours of my childhood were passed; 
Iloved all its rooms, the pantry and hall, 
But that blest old kitchen was dearer than all: 
Its chairs and its table, none brighter could be, 
For all its surroundings were sacred to me; 
To the nail in the ceiling, the latch on the door, 
And I 
loved every crack in that old kitchen floor, 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the old kitchen floor, the old kitchen floor, 
How dear to my heart is the old kitchen floor. 
I 
remember the fire-place, with mouth high and wide, 
The old-fashioned oven that stood by its side, 
Out of which, each Thanksgiving„ came puddings and pies, 
That fairly bewildered and dazzled my eyes; 
And then, too, St. Nicholas slyly and still 
Came down every Christmas our stockings to fill; 
But the dearest memories I've laid up in store, 
Is the mother that trod on that old kitchen floor 
Oh, the old, dre. 
Day in and day out, and from morning till night, 
Her foot-steps were busy, her heart always light, 
711 
For it seemed to me then that she knew not a 
care, 
The smile was so gentle her face used to wear; 
I 
remember with pleasure what joy filled our eyes, 
When she told us the stories that children so prize; 
They were new every night though we heard them before 
From her lips at the wheel on the old kitchen floor. 
Oh, the old, &c, 
To night these old visions come back at their will 
But thewheel and its music forever are still; 
The band is moth-eaten, the wheel laid away, 
And the fingers that turned it lie moldering to clay; 
The hearth-stone, so sacred, is just as ' twas then, 
And the voices of children ring out there again; 
The sun through the window looks in as of yore, 
But it sees stranger feet on the old kitchen floor. 
I 
ask not for honor, but this I 
would crave, 
That when the lips speaking are closed in the grave, 
Oh, the old,&C. 
My children will gather their own at their side, 
And tell of their mother who long ago died; 
'Twould be more enduring, far dearer to me, 
Than inscription on marble or granite could be, 
To have them tell often as I 
did of yore, 
Of the mother who trod on the old kitchen floor, 
Oh, the old,ck. 
HOW THAT POOR GAL SUFFERED FOR ME. 
Banjo Solo, as sung by LITTLE JENNIE BENSON, 
NOW 
listen to me and a 
story I 
will tell 
Of a 
sad calamity ; 
It happened to a 
gal, her name was Sal, 
And dearly she loved me ; 
She left her home on my account 
To cross the raging sea, 
And it almost bursts my heart in two, 
When I 
think how she suffered for me. 
I 
took her out one Sunday afternoon, 
Just for to have a 
lark; 
Says she, my love, the ball is up, 
We'll go to the Central Park. 
When we got on the ice she went to strike out. 
But the ice being slippery, 
Her heels flew up, she came down ker slap ! 
How that gal did suffer for me. 
For seven long years I 
courted her, 
With all my might and main, 
And I 
swore that none should separate me 
From my sweet Mary Jane! 
But it happened one dark and stormy night, 
To an oyster saloon went she, 
Where she choked to death with a 
soft-shell crab, 
Which ended her suffering for me.

OH! NICODEMUS. 
My 
lover he's`going to sea, Oh! Nicodemus, 
He's going away and leaving me, 
To watch the little fishes. swimming in the sea ; 
But he'll soon wish for home, and to be back with me, 
The ship will heave to, Nicodemus! 
And so wretched you will be, so wretched you will be. 
CHOELTS. 
(Spoken.) So she said— 
Oh, Nicodemus ! Nicodemus! 
don't you go away? 
I've loved you Nicodemus and I've loved you many a 
day, 
I've loved you in your plain attire, your lovely fustian coat. 
Don,t leave me Nicodemus, for that boiler-bursting boat. 
(SPoxEN.) And again she began to sing— 
Salt water, you know, is very wet, Oh, Nicodemus! 
You know you are my only pet, 
And your absence will cause me to fume and fret ; 
They will feed you on salt junk and nasty soft boiled peas, 
Think of this well 
Nicodemus ! 
Ere you cross those watery seas, those windy watery seas; 
So ohs said, &c.

Cf pumpkins boiled you'll get no more, Oh, Nicodemus! 
Cmvince yourself of this before, 
Yu

Beef the anchor, Nicodemus, the Captain he will say, 
You'll have to hold on by your eyebrows, 
Or you'll be blown away, straight down to Botany Bay; 
So she said, &c. 
This is what he said— 
It's no use you talking to me; said Nicodemus ? 
For I 
intend agoing out to sea,

Out to China for Souchong and Lingo Tea. 
That's a 
profitable cargo, in fact you can't get a 
better, 
Direct from Hong Kong, Australia, 
When you send to me a

letter. 
And she began again yelping, 
Oh, Nicodemus, & c.

His aim's to do nothing at all, 
While some in thi3 world run and climb, 
He takes the trip easy and crawls. 
CHOBUS. 
For they tell him he's awfully clevah; 
Oh, so clevah ' deuced clevah,

Some fellahs go in for the Army? 
And some fellahs go in for trade, 
lint he hasn't such bores to alarm him, 
His fortune was already made. 
And some fellahs go in for brain, 
And scriblde to earn an honest penny, 
Those follahs deserve all their gains, 
As for brains he could do without any. 
in the park he is often seen driving, 
Ile thinks he's Alexis, the, duke, 
Whenever he goes in for billiards, 
He thinks he's a

Some times at an evening party, 
To keep us alive in he'll peep, 
Whenever we ask him to sing, 
We are certain to fail fast asleep,

THE REFORMER ON THE SLY, 
Revised and sung by JOHNNY ROACH with great success. 
GOOD people all, take my advice, and listen unto me, 
But don't put too much confidence in every man you see; 
They say fine feathers make fine birds, but not so every one, 
For men will often wear broadcloth to hide their little game; 
But whether they are fish or fowl it makes no difference to I, 
I 
know my business, you can bet, I'm a 
reformer on the sly. 
There are fifty kinds of swindling mills in the papers every days 
And lotteries where you draw a 
farm [God knows how far 
away]. 
There's politicians now-a-days that at public expense, 
They rob our city government arid leave it not worth a 
cent; 
I 
wish for once I 
was a 
judge, and had those thieves to try, 
They'd get sent up and polished off, by a 
reformer on the sly. 
There's Madame Morris, from Corsica, who with her telescope, 
Your future wife or husband shows; good gracious! that's a 
joke, 
If you give to her but fifty cents, she'll send you a 
card by mail; 
I 
think they ought to find her a 
home, six months in the county 
jail. 
There's the seventh daughter of the seventh son, and to swindle 
you they'll try, 
But I 
know their little euchre game, I'm a 
reformer on the sly. 
In Chatham street the other day, I 
tok a 
walk along, 
I 
heard a 
fellow crying out, Going, going, gone; 
Who bids for it, this line gold watch, the finest ever seen ? 
They thought I 
was a 
little flat— perhaps a 
little green; 
I 
says, excuse me, please, if I 
wink so with my eve, 
I 
know my business, you can bet, I'm a 
reformer on the sly. 
PAT ROACH AT THE PLAY,‘‘ 
Music of this song can,be obtained of E. H. 
HARDING, 
288 Bower7. 
AS Pat Roach and the missus trom Galway, 
In Dublin once happened to be, 
To the playhouse they went one fine evening, 
Determined diversion to see; 
But says Pat as he entered there's no one, 
" 
Pay here," cried a 
voice, " holy murther," 
Says Pat, " there's a 
man in the wall." 
" 
Pay here," cries a 
voice, " holy murther,” 
Says Pat, " there's a 
man in the wall." 
The missus she looked all around her, 
In wonder her eyes they did roll, 
But says she " Paddy darling, alanna, 
He is here like a 
rat in a 
hole, 
Pay here, how much is it ? a 
shilling; 
A 
shilling apiece, that won't do, 
'Tis too much, Mister Pay here avourneen, 
Eighteen pince I 
will give you for two, 
'Tis too much, Mister Pay here avourneen, 
E 
*ghteen pince I 
will give you for two. 
Pat grumbled but paid and got seated, 
The hand was beginning to play, 
He j 
igg,'d on his seat quite elated, 
And to the musicians did say, 
"Tis yer selves that can do it, nae bouchals, 
28 
And I 
wish to ye's wid all my mind, 
To the fiddlers more power to your elbows,' 
Mister bugler, Heav'n spare ye, 3-er wind, 
To the fiddlers more power to your elbows, 
Mister bugler, Heav'n spare ye, yer wind. 
The play then went on, and Pat wondered, 
And sat with his mouth open wide, 
As the proud haughty Lord of the Manor, 
Sought to make the fair maiden his bride. 
"To the mountains," says he, .` I 
will bear thee," 
She shrieked as she saw him approach, 
" 
Is there no one at hand now to save me?" 
Shouts a 
voice, " yis, me darlin, Pat Roach." 
Then up on the seat, jumped brave Paddy. 
Says he, " now you blackguard, be gone, 
Or a 
lord though you be, tin times over, 
I'll knock your two eyes into one:— 
" 
Sit down there in front!" " what you spalpeen," 
Is it me you thus dar to addriss, 
De ye think that Pat Roach would sit aisy, 
And see that poor girl in distress? 
A 
scuffle ensued in a 
minute, 
But soon sure the row did subside. 
And as 
at gasped for breath he discovered, 
Of the door he was on the wrong side; 
He soon found the missus, next morning 
They started for home, and Pat swore, 
If he once safely landed in Galway, 
He'd come up to Dublin no more.

THE CHARCOAL MAN. 
Composed and Sung by GEORGE WELLING, the Gm= 
ComIcine, 
Am.—Dublin Carman. 
MY name is Denny Conner, I 
am a 
charcoal man, 
And if you will but listen, you'll see I'm an Irishman, 
I 
was born in Dublin City, that place of great renown, 
But now I'm here in America and peddling charcoal 
through the town. 
CHORUS. 
Charcoal is my cry, I 
make the old horse git, 
And if he does go slow you'll bet I 
use the whip, 
I 
fell in love with a 
nice young girl, her name was Rosy 
Ann, 
She said I 
was a 
genius and she'd have no other man; 
But now she's gone and left me, for a 
fellow by the name 
of McGee, 
Who peddles sawdust around the the city and ray Rosy 
no more I'll see. 
Charcoal is my cry, &c. 
One day when they were riding the horse he took a 
fright, 
And ran away with Rosy and never stopped till night, 
He ran way up to Harlem Bridge, Rosy screamed with all 
her might, 
He upset the charcoal wagon and threw Rosy out of 
sight. 
Charcoal is my cry, &c. 
When McGee saw this cruel thing, it was more than he 
could stand, 
He drew out his revolver and blew himself off the 
land, 
So now I'm left alone, to lead a 
single life, 
And to peddle charcoal as you see, with no Rosy for my 
wife. 
Charcoal is ray cry, ezc.

Man is but a 
Pipe and His Life is but Smoke. 
As Originally sung by JOHNNY ROACH. 
CONTENTED I 
sit with my pipe and my glass, 
Puffing sorrow and care far away, 
Though liquor may banish man's reason afar, 
lie's only a 
fool or a 
sot, 
While his sense and his reason are always at Nwar, 
He don't know when enough he has got. 
CIEOIMS. 
Though many may laugh, others may joke, 
Man's but a 
pipe and his life is but smoke. 
Now man and a 
pipe are much nearer to kin, 
Than ever you have understood, 
For until with breath they are both filled within, 
Pray tell me for what are they good; 
For the one and the other composed are of clay, 
And if right I 
tell nature's plan, 
It takes but the breath from them both right away, 
The pipe dies and so cloth the man. 
Though many may, &c. 
Now I'm told by my pipe man's lot is to die, 
For sooner or later he must, 
And when to the end of life's journey he's got, 
Like a 
pipe that's smoked out he's but dust; 
Then all you that wish in your hearts to be gay, 
Encourage not grief, strife nor sorrow, 
Make much of your pipe of tobacco to-day, 
For you may be smoked out on the morrow. 
Though many may, &c.

NEW YORK SOCIETY. 
v 
AIR.—London S9Ciety. 
As sung by JOHNNY M ARKS. 
I 
THIN I've travelled everywhere, and seen what's to be seen 
Wherever I 
may roam I 
make myself at home, 
I've flirted down to Long Branch to Newport I 
have been, 
To Saratoga, Rockaway and to Rome; 
I've seen society in every shape and form, 
I've watched the tide of fashions rise and fall; 
I've viewed it in its calm, I've seen it in its storm, 
And this is my conclusion after all. 
CHORUS. 
Baden Baden Spa, France and Germany, 
Liverpool or London, Spain or Italy; 
In such society there's much variety, 
But nothing equals New York society. 
Society as soon as the New York season's o'er, 
Will to the sea run down, where in a 
bathing gown, 
It dabbles in the water or perhaps upon the shore, 
It yawns and wishes it was back in town, 
And though it may be nice to drink the nasty waters, 
And lose your money gambling at the Spa, 
And meet the sort of men you'd cuL at any place, 
The New York season I 
prefer by far. 
Baden Baden Spa, (!cc. 
Society I've met with in old Ireland, mid the bogs, 
In Paris ever gay, in London every day, 
In Mount St. Bernard convent, with the monks and jolly dogs, 
At every place I 
think that I 
may say, 
But there's a 
charm in town, I 
can't help saying so, 
Which makes me like it more than ail the rest, 
To the opera we go. and that will plainly show, 
Society in New York is the best. 
Baden Baden Spa, &c..

PADDY CABBY. 
As sung by JOIINNY Roeen. 
'TWAS at the town of nate Clogheen, 
That Sergeant Snapp met Paddy Carey; 
A 
claner boy was never seen. 
Brisk as a 
bee, light as a 
fairy; 
His brawny shoulders, four feet square, 
His cheeks like thumping red potatoes, 
His legs would make a 
chairman stare! 
And Pat was loved by all the ladies. 
Old and young, grave and sad, 
Deaf and dumb, dull or mad, 
Waddling, twaddling, limping, squinting, 
Light, brisk and airy— 
CHORUS. 
All the sweet faces at Limerick races, 
From Nullinavelt to Magherafelt, 
At Paddy's beautiful name would melt ! 
The sowls would cry, and look so shy, 
Och! Cushlamachree, did you never see 
The jolly boy, the darling joy, the lathes' tco 
Nimble-footed, black-eyed, rosy-cheeked, 
Curly-headed Paddy Carey! 
0, sweet Paddy, beautiful Paddy ! 
Nate little, tight little Paddy Carey. 
His heart was made of Irish oak, 
Yet, soft as streams, frfIrr sweet Killarney, 
His tongue was tipped with a 
bit of the brogue, 
But the deuce a 
bit at all of the blarney. 
Now Sergeant Snapp, so sly and keen; 
While Pat was coaxing duck-legged Mary. 
A 
shilling slipped, so nate and cane, 
By the powers, he 'listed Paddy Carey I 
Tight, and sound—strong and light— 
Cheek so round—eyes so bright— 
Whistling, humming, drinking, drumming, 
Light, tight and airy— 
AU the sweet faces, ikc.

OLD BROWN'S DAUGHTER. 
THERE lives an ancient party, 
At the other end of town, 
He keeps a 
little chandler's shop, 
his ancient name is Brown; 
He's got an only daughter, 
Such a 
party I 
ne'er saw, 
By jingo, I 
should like to be 
That old chap's son-in-law. 
Cuoaus. 
Old Brown's daughter's a 
proper sort of girl, 
Old Brown's daughter's as fair as any pearl, 
I 
wish I 
was the Lord Mayor, a 
Marquis, or an Earl,'1 
I'm blo wed if I 
wouldn't marry old Brown's girl. 
Old Brown now he sells very nearly 
Everything you'd please, 
Treacle, soap, and bundles of wood, 
Lollypops and cheese; 
His daughter minds the shop, 
It's a 
treat to see her serve, 
I'd like to run away with her, 
But I 
haven't got the nerve. 
Old Brown's daughter, &e. 
Poor old Brown, he's very often, 
Troubled with the gout, 
He " grumbles " in the little parlor 
When he can't get out; 
85 
Then I 
go and make a 
purchase, 
0! and when she hands the change, - 
That gal makes mefee/ga/-vanized, 
I 
feel so very strange. 
Old Brown's daughter, &c. 
Miss Brown she smiles so sweetly, 
When I 
say a 
tender word, 
But old Brown says that she shall wed , 
A 
Marquis or a 
Lord; 
But I 
don't think as ever 
One of them swells I 
shall be, 
But, by jingo ! next election 
I 
shall put up for M. P. 
SPOKEN. —I 
shall then get in the House of Commons, which 
is only next door to the Lords. " Who'll vote for Scroggins ? 
Scroggins for Spitalfields ! 
Scroggins for ever! Scroggins the 
workingman's friend ! 
Down with taxes and up with Scrog-
gins! 
Scroggins votes for everything!" I 
think I'd stand a 
chance, anyhow I 
shouldn't he the only muff in the house—and. 
then I 
should be the happy owner of— 
Old Brown's daughter. &c.

We're always to be found. 
Shure Old Ireland is the place, 
For a

If you're not mighty shy, 
Shure they'll blacken up your eyes,

When sticks they let fly.

I 
Want to Go Home to Mamma. 
I 
ONCE had a 
sweetheart, tho' her name was Brown, 
She was most decidedly green; 
But when you have seen her you'll say she's as nice 
A 
..oung lady as ever was seen. 
And then she's so funny, she's just like a 
child, 
She loved me, but much better far 
Sho loved her dear parents, for always she said: 
"I want to go home to Mamma." 
Cnours. 
I 
want to go home to Mamma, 
I 
want to go home to Mamma, 
It's naughty, I 
say, to keep me away, 
When I 
want to go home to Mamma. 
When fInt I.
'beheld her, I 
thought what a dear! 
With joy, oh ! I 
nearly went wild, 
But when I 
began to boo and to coo, 
Why she sniveled out like a 
child. 
I 
thought she was ill, I 
couldn't make her out, 
When she jumped up and said, "oh, ta-ta f" 
I 
said, 4 
Pray don't you go," when she simpered out, 
I 
want to go home to Mamma. 
I 
want to g0 home, ate. 
Well, with lots of persuasion and coaxing andSum, 
The worst job I've had in ray life: 
os 
• 
I 
contrived to persuade her i 
loved her so much, 
That she said she would be my w:fe. 
We drove to the church, when oh! what a 
scene. 
She would have the door left ajar; 
When the clergyman said, " Will you wed?" she shrlei(ed out; 
"Nor I 
want to go home to Mamma. 
I 
want to go home, &C. 
At last we were married; oh, my, what a 
job 
To the continent then off we went, 
And I 
am happy to say she her nervousness lost 
When the honeymoon cosy we'd spent. 
And now she's so difierent to what she once was, 
We're happy by night and by day; 
Her marriage she says she will never regret, 
And no more do I 
hear her say: 
I 
want to home, &;c:

'CRIME. 
Sung with great success by Jon!.my Rolm. 
:Music published by Wiirr2 .4; oomAno. Boston, MKS. 
I'VE been thinking of late, I've been thinking, 
My thoughts I 
can scarcely define, 
I've been thinking why people can wonder, 
At this terrible increase of crime; 
Cries, Old Uncle Sam it's a " poser," 
There's a 
something I 
can't understand, 
[ 
I 
would just give a 
trifle to know, sir, 
Why crime should increase in our land. 
• 
I'm sure that we've plenty of gold, sir, \ 
Our banks are as full as can hold, sir, 
We could buy the whole world I 
am told, sir,'\0 
Yet still, there's an increase of crime. 
:It's true what you say, Uncle Samuel, " 
We've plenty of gold laid away, 
Mouldy with trale,w and rust, sir, 
Guarded by aght and by day; 
While you, like a 
dog in the manger, 
Your gold to yourself you confine, 
When a 
little would make a 
great change, sir,1 
In this terrible increase of crime. 
For expenses you don't care a 
groat, sir, 
Politicians, you feed a 
whole lot, sir, 
While the poor man, with hunger may rot, sir, 
And still you wonder at crime. 
I 
am sure you will own Uncle Sam, sir, 
Temptation is hard to resist, 
Just look at our poor working girl, sir, 
Striving her best to exist., 
r.,,e-VP 
Can you wonder at weak constitutions, 
When blood-sucking firms, barely give, 
Enough to keep off destitution, 
A 
girl, though she's poor, she must live. 
There's our poor needle girl, God defend her, 
With feelings as proud and as tender, 
As your proud city lady, remember, 
Uncle Sam can you wonder at crime. 
Can you wonder at crime can you wonder, 
When you see the police on his beat, 
Arresting a 
poor starving man, sir, 
For begging his bread on the street; 
While the thief on the corner stands grinnina 
In the broad open light of the day, 
Your pockets he'd pick for a 
shilling, 
And the law cannot touch himEthey say. 
Ile smiles with contempt and derision, 
lie defies a 
whole police division, 
While the poor man is sent off to prison, 
And still you wonder at crime. 
Just think while your drinking your wine, sir 
lbw the poor of our land they are fed, 
While you, with your rich folks can dine, sir, 
'Tis a 
god-send for them to get bread; 
Go visit the home of the poor, sir, 
Such sights you will never behold, 
To our prisons then go and explore, sir, 
And scatter your hoardings of gold. 
A. little would soon break asunder, 
The chains the poor sufferer is under. 
Go, list to that great voice of hunger, 
And you:11 never wow wonder at dim,

Is to let other folks go first, go first? yes, after me.

Alter me, Yes, After me and then you shall be first. 
Whilst walking out the other day ' twas somewhere near the

Some rough was just about to take my handkerchief away, 
But I

I 
had a 
dance one night last week 'twas at a 
tradesman's hall, 
With such a 
charming partner too, the handsomest of all, 
At my expense she drank Champagne when some swell said 
my dear, 
When the ball is done I'll see you home, I 
whisper'd in his ear. 
After me, &c.

And when the " settling" times come round will never pay his

BRIGADIER BRANIGAN. 
As sung by Mickey Malian, the great patten Vocalist. 
When I 
was a 
single young man, the girls they all tried to 
please me ; 
To be merry was always my plan, for devil a 
thing could tease 
me 
I was always merry and gay, how I 
jigged it with Judy O'Ca. 
lagan. 
Until, like a 
poor ninny one clay, I 'listed with Brigadier Bra-
nigan. 
SPOKEN:—The Brigadier was a 
tall, slim man, about .
SiZ 
feet five, and:as fine a 
looking man as you'd meet in a 
day's 
walk—people used to take me for the Brigadier.—He used to 
come Into my mothers sheebin shop every morning for a 
nog_ 
gin of whisky, and he'd talk to me about the battles he was in 
and the battles he was'n't in ; about the Generals he killed 
And the Generals that killed him, until he had me as full of 
:military ardor as an egg is full of meat. 
One morning he 
said to me, " Paddy," said he, " will you take a_shillings farth ?" 
Said I, I 
will, for Pm dead broke this minute. " Oh," said 
he, " you don't understand me, the Queen wants men." Well, 
said I, I 
know plenty of women that want men, besides the 
Queen. " so, no, that's not what I 
mean," said he, " will you

But something told me all the day, arrah, Paddy, your'e put-

Och, hone, how the girls they did cry, especially Judy O'Ca-

Who I 
left with a

SPOKEN :—We were all drawn up in rasp and file—or rank

One fine morning I 
walked 
over to him as polite as you please, Good morning, your ho-
nor, said I, would you be after taking a 
drop of the creater 
this morning ? " I 
don't mind if I 
do," said he, so over the 
road we started to a 
sheebin shop and I 
called for a 
half pint. 
I 
was pouring out a 
noggin for him, when he grabbed the mug 
out of my hand. " Hould on, Paddy; me boy," said he, "dis-
cipline among the men. 
The privates are never allowed to 
drink, while the officers are around." He put the mug to his 
mouth and divil a 
sup he left for poor me. " Fall in!" he 
cried, Arrah, we'll not fall out, said I. " Stand at ase !" How 
can I 
when there's a 
big cobble stone viiider my right foot.

Forward, march I" I 
didn't execute the order quick enough,

bombshell, taking the head clean off the Brigadier. " Hurrah!" 
cried Murphy. raising his hand, " We're free at last !" when 
along came another bombshell, taking the hand right off of 
Alurphy. " Arrah !" cried Murphy, " I've lost me hand ! I've 
lost me hand !" 
Hould your gab, you black-guard, said I, 
re's the Brigadier has lost his head, and divil a 
word he

I 
went over to where he was lying. 
Are you kilt, said I, 
he didn't condescend to speak to me. 
If you have any request 
to make, said I, if you tell me what it is, I 
will do it for you. 
"Paddy," said he, " I'm not kilt, but I'm murdered, and 
spachless. and if you have any regards for me, you'll be afther

I'll do that same

So over the field I 
went, looking for his head; at last 
f 
came to it, trying to roll over to a 
canteen full of whisky. 
I 
knew it was his head, for he had a 
big pimple on the side 
pf his nose. 
I 
brought it over to him. There's your head, said 
(. " No, Paddy, that's not my head," Yes it is, said I, " No, 
it's not," said he, Well, head, or no head, said .I,Divil another

THE SPADE. 1 
As originally sung by GRIFF BOWDEN. 
GIVE me the Spade and the man who can use it: 
A 
fig for your lord, and his soft silken hands, 
Let the man who has strength never stoop to abuse It, 
Give back to the giver—the land, boys, the laud. 
There's no bank like the Earth to deposit your labor, 
The more you deposit the more you shall have; 
If there's more than you want you can give to your neighbor, 
And your name shall be dear to the true and the brave. 
CHoaUs. — Give me the sp.ad, &c. 
Give me the spade—the American's glory— 
That fashions the field from the bleak barren moor, 
Let us speak cf its praise in ballad and story, 
While ' tis brightened with labor, not tarnished with gore, 
It was not the Sword that won our best battles, 
Created our Commerce, extended our Trade, 
Gave food for our wives, our children, our cattle, 
But the queen of all Nveapons—the Spade, beys, the Spade. 
Give me the spade, & c. 
Give me the Spade, there's a 
magic about it, 
That turns the black soil into bright shining gold, 
What would our fathers have done, boys, without, 
When this land lay all bare and the north wind blew told, 
Where the tall forests stood, and the wild beasts were yelling, 
Where our stout-hearted ancestors shrank back afraid— 
Now the cornstack is raised and have cleared a 
dwelling, 
Then Hurrah for our true friend, the Spade, boys, the Spade. 
Give me the spade, S:c.

Bounteous nature loves all lands,

Such God's wonders floating by, 
Castle Lough and Glenna Bay, 
Mountains Tore and Eagle's Nest, 
Still at Mucross you must pray, 
Though the monks are now at rest.

Bright-hued berries daff the snows, 
Smiling winter's frown away. 
Angels often pausing there,

Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney, 
Music there for Echo dwells, 
Makes each sound a

Many-voiced the chorus swells, 
Till it faints in ecstacy.

Seems the heaven above to vie, 
All rich colors that we know, 
Tinge the cloud wreaths in that sky.

Glancing back soft light divine,

JERSEY SAM. 
011! I 
was born in Jersey, 
And of that I'm going to sing; 
And yet it seems but yesterday, 
For time is on the wing. 
I 
went way down to New Orleans; , 
And there I 
fought the foe, 
Along with Hickory Jackson, 
Some Fifty Years ago. 
Cnortus. 
For I 
am one of the olden time, 
And may be thought too gay, 
But I'm Jersey Sam, the Farmer's Mat, 
Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah 
bear the name of Samuel, 
Though some, they call me Sam, 
And through this world I 
rove along, 
As happy as I 
can; 
The world, they say, has been improved 
But I 
should like to know, 
If folks are any better now, 
Than Fifty Years ago, 
For I 
am one, &e.

When I 
was young, then boys were boys, 
And went to bed at ten; 
But now, when they are twelve years old, 
They think that they are men. 
You'll hear them call for rum and beer, 
And smoke cigars heigh-ho I 
What would our parents have thought of that 
Some Fifty Years ago ? 
For I 
am one, & c. 
At midnight, too, one hears young men, 
With husky voices sing, 
That " Champagne Charlie" is their name, 
And they know it's no such thing; 
They go to bed with a 
head-ache, 
At least they tell us so, 
I 
never heard of such a 
thing, 
Some Fifty Years ago. 
For I 
am one, &C. 
The women of the present time, 
They cannot draw a 
line, 
But wear our hats and jackets, 
And appear quite masculine; 
They wear false hair, for it's the style, 
And call it their own; you know— 
But our girls would scorn to wear a 
wig, 
some Fifty Years ago.

CHORUS. 
With my real royal al da dah, with my real royal al dadah, 
My real royal addy oh, there's whiskey in the jar, 
Oh whiskey you're the divil, you've led me astray; 
Over hills and over mountains, and out of the way. 
You're stronger, sweeter, decenter, and spunkyer than tea 
Oh whiskey, you're my darling, drunk or sober. 
Say's the mother do not wrong me, 
Do not take my daughter from me, 
For if you do, I 
will torment you, 
And after death, my ghost will haunt you.

Now the drums are beating boldly, 
Men are dying, hot and coldly; 
Give every man his flask of powder, 
And his firelock on his shouldcr,

When we're married, Molly darling, 
Anti you are my loving spouse, 
We'll have lots of Dolly Vardens, 
Playing tag around the house; 
You must give them paregoric, 
Put them in their little bed, 
should they annoy you, MoLy darling.

THE dawn upon the hill was breaking, the stars were twinkling 
in the sky, 
As Pat upon the ground lay dreaming, his big shilielah lay close 
by, 
All night tio whiskey he's been drinking, and now he wakens 
from Ins drunken snore, 
He calls for drink to make hint frisky, and swears because there 
is no more. 
C I

Then fill up the bowl, hurrah ! for a 
thirsty soul, ha! ha! 
An night on.a spree, my boys, my throat with fire is burning, 
Dance so lilLhe and gay,harrah none like Pat can be, ha! ha! 
Divil a 
hair I 
care, my boys, we won't go home till morning. 
The moon upon the logs was gleaming, and the lambs were 
bleath mg in the shed, 
The pigs and sows the swill are raking, and the gossons waiting 
to be fed, 
Pat home from the wake is trudging slowly, . with divil a 
farth-
ing in his purse, 
Besides his pockets are both holey, and credit to poor Pat not 
worth a 
curse. 
Then till up, & e. 
The night and fun again advances, and the song and dam() 
again goes 'round, 
And Pat again is nimbly drinking, until with whiskey he gets 
drowned, 
All night he's been swigging at the bottle, and now he tumble 
flat upon the floor. 
Yet still the boys and girls are dancing, but Pat's asleep tc, 
dance no more.

THE KISS BEHIND THE DOOR ) 
Or, Where's Rosanna Gone? 
As sung by GEORGE HARRIS. 
0 
ONCE I 
was as gay 
As a 
jolly young cock sparrow, 
Who's perch' d 
upon an apple tree, 
Or down amongst the corn. 
But now clean through my heart 
You could drive a 
large wheel-barrow, 
For my love has left a 
hole it it, 
0 
where's Rosanna gone. 
C
HORUS. 
*I 
shall never kiss my love again behind the kitchen door, 
I 
shall never squeedge my darling's little finger any more. 
And she'll ne'er pinch my funny-bone until it's rather sore. 
Oh where's Rosanna gone. 
I'm sure no other maid 
Could equal my Rosanna, 
Without my love this manly form 
Will soon become a 
wreck; 
Of her Dad I 
was afraid, 
He's a 
disagreable tanner, 
And he's often promised faithfully 
He'd dislocate my neck. 
I 
shall never kiss my love, S:c, 
r 
r 
or an evening after tea, 
While her Daddy blew his ‘ bacca', 
I'd seek my love Rosanna, and 
Ask her to share my lot. 
But when he found it out, 
Oh my! how he would whack her, 
While I'd jump over the garden wall, 
As tho' I'd just been shot. 
I 
shall never kiss my love, &c. 
I'd jumped over the wall one night, 
In search of sweet Rosanna, 
And tho' I 
gently whistled, 
My love did not appear; 
But my hair stood bolt upright, 
For out came her dad, the tanner, 
Oh! my teeth tley rattled like dominoes, 
And my legs doubled up with fear. 
I 
should never see my love, &c. 
Some say she's hid away, 
By her cruel Dad on purpose, 
To cure her of her love for me. 
Some say my love's no more. 
If she's defunct, then soon 
Shall they find my gray cold corpus, 
And our ghosts shall come and frighten her Dad 
Behind the kitchen door. 
I 
shall never kiss ray love, 4c.

THAT'S THE WAY THE STORY GOES, 
Sung by JENNIE ENGL. 
THERE was a 
Young Woman her name was Fan, that's the 
way the story goes, 
She fell in love with a 
man named Dan, that's the way the 
story goes, 
Now Dan loved Fan and Fan loved Dan, as true as a woman 
loves a 
man, 
And Dan he owned a 
Potato can,—that's the way the story 
goes. 
"I'd like to get married," says Dan to ran, that's the way 
the story goes, 
Say's Fan, " I 
quite approve of the plan, "—that's the way 
the story goes, 
Dan said, " go get your parents' consent," Fan said " she 
would," and away she went 
Looking so fair and innocent,—that's the way the story goes, 
As Fan was going down Nassau Street, that's the way the 
story goes ; 
Another Young Man she chanced to meet, that's the way the 
story goes; 
He looked so shy and winked his eye, to escape his glances 
Fan aid try, 
'Twas all in vain, he gave her a Pie,—that's the way the 
story goes, 
5T • 
The Pie it gained the heart of Fan, that's the way the story 
goes, 
The Rival of Dan was a 
Penny Pieman, that's the way the 
story goes, 
Fan gained her Father's and Mother's consent to get married 
and off with the rieman went, 
But since that day she's had cause to repent,—that's the way 
the story goes. 
For coming away from Church that day, that's the way the 
story goes, 
A 
German Band began to play, that's the way the story goes, 
And frightened a 
horse in front of a 
car, knocked down and 
killed the Poor Pieman. 
And made a 
widow of faithless Fan—that's the way the story 
goes, 
Now broken-hearted about the streets, 
that's the way the' 
story goes, 
Faithless Fan her Dan oft meets, that's the way the story 
goes; 
rle heeds her not but passes her by, "all hot! Two a 
penny,' 
she hears him cry, 
"And" she's sorry she ever took the pie,— that's the way the 
story goes. 
Did You Ever See an Oyster Walk Dpstairs. 
Written by F. GILBERT 
I 
LOVE a 
very handsome girl with gleaming golden hair, 
My charmer will not marry me, she daily does declare: 
Upon my knees she asks me to, but in a 
knowing way,— 
She slyly shakes her saucy head, and then to me does say— 
CHORUS. 
Did you ever see an oyster walk up stairs ? 
Walk up stairs ? walk up stairs? 
Well, when you do, I'll marry you and share your cares, 
But not before you see an oyster walk up stairs. 
I've got a 
nicely furnished house, a 
few pounds in the bank, 
My friends assure me that I 
am good tempered, gay and frank; 
All this I 
tell my darling, but her love I 
cannot gain, 
She shuts her eyes and then replies in this annoying strain— 
Did you ever, & c. 
Fine satins, silks and laces rich, I 
say that she shall wear. 
If willing but to marry me, to buy them all I 
swear; 
To operas and theatres I 
promise she shall go, 
But still she asks the question, and so slyly wants to know— 
If I 
ever saw, &c. 
To all the oyster shops in town, I 
sadly wend my way, 
To Billingsgate I 
often go, as well as to Herne Bay; 
In hope to find an oyster that will undertake the task, 
But everybody laughs at me when dolefully I 
ask— 
CHORCS. 
TIM you got a 
leetle native that can walk up stairs? 
Walk up-stairs ? 
walk up-stairs ? 
For if you have, she'll marry me and share in 
cares, 
But not before you see an oyster walk up stairs. 
This question I 
will make my own, and use it when I 
can, 
No matter what the query is, 
answer every man ; 
For instance, if my landlord calls, demanding six month's rent 
I'll say, "Old boy, you'll get it, if you witness the event."— 
Cnoars. 
The day an artful oyster walks up stairs ? 
Walks up stairs ? 
walks up stairs ? 
For when you do, I'll pay it you, and ease your care; 
But riot before you see an oyster walk up stairs.

The New

A 
little book has 1 
tely appeared in print at Messrs. Psher & 
Denison's, OS Nassa 
street, called " The Little Flirt." We cannot 
sa-, 
that we recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, 
as re think it would only encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
'Unfortunately there is enough of it done without any :urther neces-
sity of expiaining ' how, when and where to do it," and this little 
volume would advise and initiate the uncorrupted in practising what 
is commonly called " flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: 
We have lately seen a 
neat little book, bound in morocco, costing 
25 cents, called " The Little Flirt," pubiished by Messrs. Fisher & 
Denison, 98 Nassau street. 
It gives information of the modus oper-
andi o flirting, and of the meaning of every motion of the hand-
kerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As there is nothing at all objec-
tionable in the volume, and its contents might afford some innocent 
amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recommend it to our 
young lady and gentlemen readers.

It Ls a 
Fac Simile of a 
Trick practiced by all the Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accompanied with directions so 
plainly written, that, with a 
single perusal, any person can 
become an adept in an unfailing source of amusement 
Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
"An ing:nious little book of the thaumaturgic order has been sent us, 
called 
ITUMPTY DI7NiFIT,' and bound in such a 
way as to 6ire opportunity 
for a 
decided:y puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appearance of 
a 
child's picture- book, gayly printed and colored; it is so bound that a 
prac-
tical manipulator. takmg it up, and flirting the ledves rapnily over, can in ake 
it appear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with blank pages, tr 
with any one of quite a 
succession of fiemres. 
One minute the pamphlet, 
quickly thumbed. appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, in 
his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, nothing but Pantaloon, 
or Mainz, Hood, or Mephistopheles. 
A 
little practice, and the directions 
printed with the book will make anybody at home in the handling of it.—

SPARRING or, The Theory and Practice of 
the Art of Self- Defence. 
BY L. 
H ILDEBRAND. 
Illustrated by engravings, accompanied by instructions of value 
to the novice or proficient. 
The subject is divided into three parts. 
The first includes the 
principles and practice of the school of sparring, with remarks on 
the set-to. 
The second consists of means of attack and defence of 
a 
more difficult nature to make an accomplished sparrer, and a 
description of a 
set-to. 
The third includes wrestling and train-
ing; attacks that may be expected from rough or unskilled per-
sons, and methods of avoiding the same; remarks on gymnastic 
exercises, etc. 
The lessons are laid out in a 
systematic and simple manner, 
which will impart a 
good foundation of knowledge on the sub-
ject, so that by practising the rules one may attain to the utmost 
perfection. 
The book is written as the scholar should progress, and those 
parts to which special attention is di:ected should be practised 
thoroughly, the advantage of which will become apparent in sub-
sequent lessons, in which will be found everything necessary to 
make a complete sparrer.
