Go out and work for me;

To a

sketch, " Who Owns the Line.” 
ME name is Mike Malony, 
I'm a 
carpenter by trade; 
I 
married Molly Higgins, 
Who all my trouble made. 
She'd as many of relations 
As fishes in the sea; 
They ate me out of house and home, 
And destroyed me iamily. 
CHORUS. 
There's her father, 
And her mother, 
And tier sister, 
And her brother. 
1700 babies laying on their knees, 
Her uncles and her cousins, 
And aunties by the dozen 
Lived upon the earnings of Patrick Malony. 
My pants would fit her uncle, 
Her dress would fit her niece; 
I 
have to sleep upon the roof; 
Or I 
never have no peace. 
They made me buy them dainties, 
Root over by the pad; 
I'd have to waif ' till they *ere MI1 
Before I'd git me male. 
CHORrs. 
There was pudding, 
There was mutton 
That would make you burst a 
button, 
And a 
fiery- head Corkonian 
By the name ot Pat Cloney, 
To superintend the table, 
To put me in the stable 
. - 
While they ate up all the labor of Patrick Malony. 
Her uncle wore my stockings, 
lfy hat would fit his head; 
When tired out wid labor 
They'd kick me out of bed. 
I 
put up every pinny 
For to keep them from Bellevue, 
I 
wish the coroner would sit 
On my wife and all her crew.

There's her nephews 
And her niet!ii 
That come from several places, 
1700 grandmothers 
And mothers- in- la w

A 
wagon load of Dalys; 
McSweegan and the Halys 
Lived on the earnings of Patrick Maim. 
There's her second cousin's brother, 
And his toothless old step-mother. 
And 1600 emigrants from Ireland you sea. 
Wid their boxes 'and their bedding, 
On my Ingrain carpet treading, 
They lived upon the earnings of Patrick Malony.'

There's the Bradys 
And the Gradys— 
Docent perfect ladies, 
Always axing charity 
From my family you see. 
One husband was a 
loafer, 
The other was a 
toper, 
Depending on the friendship of Patrick Malolly., 
As sung in " DAnNar's CounTsmr.” 
SURE, now what are you crying for Nel 
ly 
Don't be blubbering there like a 
fool, 
Wid the weight of the grief, faith, I

Yell break down the three legged stool. 
I

But don't believe a

He tells nothing but big lies and blarney, 
Lure, you know how he served poor Kate Kearney!" 
CHORUS. 
"But mother"—" Oh ! bother!" 
"But mother, he's going away, 
And I 
dreamed Vother night, 
Of his ghost all in white, 
Oh! mother, he's going away." 
"If he's going away all the better, 
Blessed hour when he's out of your sight, 
There's one comfort you can't get a 
letter, 
For yez neither can read nor write. 
'Twas list week 3-ou protested, 
When he courted fat Biddy Ma•.;ree, 
That the sight of the scamp you detested, 
Wid abuse, sure, your tongue never rested—."

THANKSGIVING day has come at last, 
And we march in the grand parade; 
As the drums do beat and the pipes do play 
We 
feel that we are made; 
The people cry and shout " hum, !" 
As we gallantly pass by; 
With a 
stiff upper lip we keep in step, 
And wave our flags on high. 
CHORUS. 
March time, march we hear, 
And forward march we go; 
We grasp our guns while stars and stripes 
Wave nobly to and fro; 
The Shanghai Musketeers! 
The Shanghai Musketeers! 
We 
jolly boys do march away 
In the Shanghai Musketeers: 
Our nobby suits and flashing guns, 
Such splendid marching, too; 
The people wondered and would say 
Oh! what.a.handsome crew; 
wcoiVP 
Our Captain, ' mid loud cheers 
Would bow profound and then give thanks 
For the Shanghai Musketeers. 
March time, &c, 
When up the Boulevard we did go 
To shoot for prizes there, 
And after that to dinner went 
And, oh! such a 
grand affair; 
Roast chicken, pork and beans, and ham, 
Wines, whiskey, all kinds of beers, 
Long life as a 
toast was given 
For the Shanghai Musketeers. 
March time, & c. 
At last toward home we march again 
A 
singing all the way; 
We couldn't keep straight to save our necks, 
And the band too drunk to play; 
When we reached home in the morning 
We were frisky as young steers; 
Thus ended the glorious tirst parade 
Of the Shanghai Musketeers.

tAILWAY GUIDE. 
As sung by JENNIE rinGass. 
I 
HAD to make a 
journey a 
little while ago, 
Somewhere down the Jersey Central, you must knowl 
A 
splendid-looking man, lie was seated by my side, 
He asked me if I 
would lend to him my Railway Guide. 
The man lie was troubled with absence of mind, 
The ticket for his journey he had left it far behind, 
He could not recollect the town to which he wished to ride, 
So begged that I 
would lend to him my Railway Guide. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, he had actually forgotten the name of the 
town that lie wished to travel to, 
Could only remember that 
the word contained the letter B, M or K. 
So I 
began to run 
through a 
list of towns whose name contained that letter, such 
as: 
CHORUS. 
Manyunk and Afauchchunck, Neversink and Squedunk, 
There's Peekskill and Fishkill and Catskill beside, 
Weehawken and Hoboken, Binghamton and Stonington, 
Be said he'd sure to find it in my Railway Guide, 
Then I 
produced my Appleton, and said to him " Goal man, 
Take the book I'm reading, and find it if you can;" 
He took the volume from my hand and eagerly he tried; 
To find the place he wanted in my Railway Guide. 
He searched o'er every leaf, and turned o'er every page, 
Until at last the fellow he got in quite a 
rage. 
\ 
21 
He soon turned round to me, and bitterly he cried: 
Dear Miss I 
I 
cannot find it in your Railway Guide, 
SPOKEN.—Although he said he had read all through, 
Manyunk and Mauchchunk, & c., &c. 
I 
reached my destination and was going to alight. 
He placed his hand upon my arm, and said with much affright ; 
Oh, dear miss! don't leave me, all alone to ride, 
What shall I 
do without you, and your Railway Guide. 
Said I: Oh no, I'm going down now to my hotel, 
You, sir, cannot walk with me, for it would not look well; 
But he linked his arm in mine, and kept marching by my side, 
He kept a 
firm grasp on me and my Railway Guide. 
SPOKEN 
And, said he, if we put our heads together, we 
shall certainly soon discover, whether it is 
Manyunk and Mauchchunk, &c. 
He walked with me in silence, some distance on the toad, 
I 
knew not how to leave him, when I 
got to my abode; 
And all that afternoon, the foolish fellow tried, 
To pay attention to me, and my Railway Guide; 
And once he plucked up courage, and squeezed my little glove, 
Be suddenly discovered that he was deep in love; 
He proposed and I 
accepted, I'm soon to be his bride, 
And thus I'll gain a 
husband with my Railway Guide, 
SPOKEN: And he tells me it makes him feel so happy, that 
he don't care if he never arrives either at 
Maynunk and Mauchchunk, & c.

THE NAUGHTY LITTLE BOY. 
As sung by JENNIE laurcuze. 
THERE was a 
naughty little boy, as naughty as could be, 
Who used to scream; and vex his Ma, and spill his daily tea ; 
His leisure moments he'd employ regardless of her cries, 
In sticking pins and needles in his little sister's eyes ; 
He often used to lose himself, and gave his parents pain,— 
By turning up his little nose, when he timed up again ; 
He kicked hie. mother's poodle and then out of window threw 
him, 
And bit his little brother so, that people -hardly knew him 
He used to smash his pretty toys, his Noah's Ark likewise, 
Where Elephants and Beetles were exactly of a 
size ; 
He amputate!; Japhet's arms, and cut of Noah's feet, 
Persisting ns he swallow d 
him— that ham was good, to eat : 
He never one'? repented, theugh his gentle parents frown'd, 
But took a 
11 -)!itlay from school, to see the kittens drown'd ; 
In hiding Pid I's meat he seem'd to take an honest pride, 
And teased the cat so much, that she committed suicide. 
He never shed a 
single tear o'er Pussy's monrnful fate, 
But called his nurse a 
naughty name, and went to tied at eight; 
He put th. , elndle oat, and with the last expiring spark, 
He thought tie saw two eyes that glared and glistened in tha 
dark; 
He thong-ht 1:9 SZ17/ a 
mewine• and he thouzla he heard a 
head, 
If 
23 
That would have been like Pussy's only she was cold and dead.. 
Tho' dreadful eyes drew nearer—oh, most terrible of sights--
He screamed aloud-,the cat! the cat! and then they brought 
the lights. 
They look'd about all in and out, but nothing could•they see., 
That threw a 
light upon the cause of this catastrophee; 
Until the morning came, when nurse with dreadful horror saw, 
Each nail had grown a 
talon, and each little hand a 
paw; 
He took to catching mice, and even rats he'd not refuse, 
Was seized with cataleptic fits, and hungabout the mews, 
And thinking he had got nine lives, he played at Pool all day, 
And joined the hippo-phalogical society, they say. 
He took to hating pastry, and he grew quite sick o' tart., 
Sat 7r/using at the window, till he heard the cat's-meat cart; 
His parents tried to win him back, with coaxes and with smiles, 
But he wouldn't own a 
feather bed's superior to tiles; 
I 
don't know what became of him, 
and what's more do not 
care, 
For naughty little boys like that, I 
never could a-bear,— 
Be kind to cats and kittens is the moral I 
would tell, 
And send a 
friend to see 'em drowned, and that'll do as well.

MURPHY'S LITTLE BACK ROOM; 
Original by En. 1.1AnzanAN. 
Air: Pat. Roach. 
DID you ever hear tell of Ted Murphy, 
He came from the County Mayo, 
He kept a 
bar-room in this city, 
In a 
democratic ward here below. 
His distillery was over in Brooklyn, 
In a 
place that they call Irishtown, 
You'd get a 
bucket of ale for five cents, 
He'd trust whin you'd put money down. 
(Repeat.) 
StIC,CPAS to my friend, Teddy Murphy, 
He often gave me two for one, 
I've played forty-fives at his table, 
Drank his whisky his beer and rum. 
I've counted the cracks in the ceiling, 
Swept the sand oft the !lure wid a 
broom, 
I've raffled for many a 
turkey,_, 
in Ted Murphy's little back room. 
There was laborers, canallers, and riggers. 
Who worked on the docks very hard, 
Shovelmen, pipemen, and drivers, 
Who worked on the big Boulevard. 
On Saturday nights they assembled, 
Wid a 
fiddler to play up a 
tune? 
• 25 
And they danced till the break in the morning, 
In Ted Murphy's little back room. 
There was a 
Dutchman kept over opposite, 
Who was jealous of Ted's rushing trade, 
He put up a 
job one fine evening, 
For the police to go make a 
raid 
On the liquors, barrels and glasses, 
In the bar-room wid their clubs they win, 
And poor Teddy without provocation, 
To the Island for 10 days was sint. 
Poor Teddy he lost his influence, 
In the courts and the grand committee, 
He sarved his full time in the prison, 
Praying each day to get free. 
He took spunk and jumped in the river, 
To swim to the Long Island shore, 
He got a 
cramp in his leg and his stoma* 
He sank to rise up no more,

THE MUSEUM IN THE PARK. 
Entered according to the Act of Congres, in the yeas 1974, by A. J. 
FxsuER, in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
IN the Central Park you may see ' em, 
The wonders I'll describe to you, 
For New York's got the finest museum, 
If you search the wide world thro' and thr9'. 
There's the nose of the cavalry horse, 
Which a 
Dutch soldier took great delight in, 
And thettail of the Kilkenny cat, 
The only part that was saved from his fighting. 
CHORUS. 
Then a 
fig! for each foreign museum! 
If you want just to enjoy a 
lark, 
Why! the greatest of wonders you'll see ' em, 
In the building that stands in the Park. 
There's the memory of Dowling, the Judge, 
The snout of the great Count Johannes, 
The sword of brave Sarsfield, who fought 
'Neath the fold of old Ireland's green banners. 
There's the cent that old Vanderbilt gave, 
The first in his life to a 
beggar, 
There's a 
drop from a 
new made perfume, 
More powerful in scent than a 
nagar, 
Then a 
fig, itc. 
51 
34 
There's a 
conductor that never could cheat, 
A 
driver that refused his whack, 
A 
waiter girl, not on the beat, 
And a 
poet with a 
coat on his back, 
There's a 
model of Nelse Seymour's Leg, 
A 
garter from Barnum's fat lady, 
A German could not drink a 
keg, 
And a 
wife that did not wish a 
baby. 
Then a 
fig, ,i5c. 
There's a 
laboring man got his pay, 
From Green, when his day's work was over, 
And a 
sneak would not shoulder a 
gun, 
And the freedom of Cuba recover. 
There's the bill, Johnny Bull's got to pay, 
In spite of his.boasting and clamor, 
There's the licking we'll give him sonic day, 
In return for his great Alabama. 
Then a 
fig, & c. 
There's a 
girl that does not want a 
beau, 
A 
policeman that refused a 
drink, 
Or if a 
dollar be got on the sly, 
At the meanest of crime wouldn't wink, 
Here's a 
swell wouldn't wax his moustache, 
A 
politician whe wanted to work, 
And a 
son of sweet Erin's green isle, 
Who wouldn t 
die for good Father Tom Burke.

WRECK OF TRE ATLANTIC. 
Ccpyright Securei. 
Written. Composed and Sang with great Success, by T.31AxvaLL. 
I 
AM going to say a 
word of the shipwreck that occurred 
On board the steamship Atlantic, which no doubt you all have 
he.trd. 
It is Larful for to tell, of the sorrows that befell 
That ill-fated vessel, and the passengers as \veil. 
For they danced with: right good glee—every night when on 
the sea; 
Never dreaming fur a 
moment but safe- landed they would, be, 
For they all joined together in making fun and mirth; 
To make the voyage pleasanter across the raging surf. 
On the 20th of March, they sailed away from Liverpool-, 
sck 
bright, 
With joyful hearts the; 
thong, till land was far from; 
sight. 
Thinking of friends they loved so (tear, and the welcome when 
arrived. 
Put alas fJr them it was not to be: of their hopes they were, 
deprived; 
For on the tir,-.3t of ..kpril more, whilst to Halifax being borne, 
This no!.;1, vessel struck a 
rocu just before the daylight's dawn. 
Then Captain Williams said: " Lowc.q2 
the boats save the pass- . 
engers and crew ;'' 
But the ship keeled o'er so suddenly that they had no time to do.. 
In less time than it takes to tell, the Atlantic was a 
wreck; 
The passengers startled from their sleep rushed out upon thei 
deck. 
3 
6 
But on the face of everyone of them was a 
picture of dismay. 
And the survivors say they will ne'er forget the cries they heard 
that day. 
It was then brave officer Brady, with a 
rope around his waist, 
Plunged off the ship into the sea, and to the rock made haste. 
To fasten the rope unto the rock was this brave man's plan, 
When from ship to the island rock through the raging waters 
swam. 
It is hard to thin1- not a 
woman or child, was saved that dread • 
ful night; 
But all were consigned to a 
watery grave whilst land was in 
their sight. 
For the water rushed into their berths, drowned them just as 
they were, 
Knelt praying to the Almighty God for him their lives to spare. 
It was hard to perish, and land so near; scarcely three hundred 
yards away. 
Some of them managed to get on deck, but were quick!y swept 
away. 
It was then the cry that rent the air so very wild and high, 
To God they all resigned their souls, when they knew that 
they must die. 
The scenes of that wreck no one but the survivors can relate, 
Some with despair like demons were, and some did calmly wait, 
When the fishermen came to their aid, . and rowed all alive to 
land; 
Though some were penniless yet proud, when on the ground 
did stand. 
Then they took their last look at the place where they lost their 
friends so dear, 
And consigned them to their resting place that they had been 
so near. 
SO 
let this be a 
prayer for all, wherever you may 
Oh, God; look down upon them all who now lie in the sea.

THERE was a 
Young Woman her name was Fan, that's the 
way the story goes, 
She fell in love with a 
man named Dan, that's the way thc,

Now Dan loved Fan and Fan loved Dan, as true as a woman 
loves a 
man, 
And Dan he owned a 
Potato can,—that's the way the story 
goes. 
"Pd like to get married," says Dan to ran, that's the way 
the story goes, 
Say's Fan, " I 
quite approve of tho plan, "—that's the way 
the story goes, 
Dan said, " go get your parents' consent," Fan said " she 
would," and away she went 
Looking so fair and innocent,—that's the way the story goes. 
As Fan was going down Nassau Street, that's the way the 
story goes ; 
Another Young Man she chanced to meet, that's the way th6 
story goes 
He looked so shy .and winked his eye, to escape his glanced 
Fan did try,

and off with the Pieman went, 
But since that day she's had cause to repent,—that's the way

For coming away from Church that day, that's the way the

A

Now everything am silent as the grave, 
All the boy's that belong to good old massa 
Am scatter round the country in a

Oh, what will become of Uncle Pete.

Children now am calling, 
Poor Uncle Pete come along, 
Poor Uncle Pete come along, 
Yes I 
am coming, 
Yes he is coming. 
No more will I 
see my good old missy. 
Dey laid her slowly in de clay, 
She sickened and she withered like a 
flower, 
Yes, from dis weary world she's passed away, 
So I 
roam round here ' mom'," you strauo.ers. 
And try hard to shuffle wid my feet. - 
I'm crippled, I'm aged. I'm rhumatic. 
What will become of Uncle Pete.

COMING HOtt FROM THE BALL, 
Written and Composed by JosEprr P. s 
KELLY. 
Arranged by H. S
TEIRLY. 
THERE is no place so gay as the ball- room; 
When we're dancing in dreamy delight, 
When the cares of the day never grcet us, 
In the flush of the beautiful night. 
But the dawn puts an end to our glory. 
And the pleasure we dearly adore, 
We must part from the scene so enchanting. 
And go home looking sleepy and sore. 
F-porKEN.----Yes, we all know there is nothing more delightfro 
than to go to a 
ball, and dance all night with a 
pretty girl, ano 
eat expensive suppers, and flirt a 
little in a (IC corner, and 
all that you know; but when reflecting on it the next day, one 
•;:ttn't help but think, 
CHORE'S. 
Oh it's all very well to be waltzing, 
And the pleasure we love to recall, 
But you know how we feel in the morning, 
Coming borne, coming home from the I-all. 
There the ladies are rivals of Venus, 
And their smiles all around us bestow, 
Ev'ry lace wears a 
mantle of gladness, 
There is welcome where ever we go; 
48 
But when morning comejillound we are weary, 
And we growl at the pain in our heads, 
And we thinh we were foolish for dancing, 
Wnen we should have been home in our beds. 
SPOgEN.—That is just how it is. 
It's all very fine while it 
lasts, but we have to pay for it in the end. 
One will say, " Oh, 
iny, I'm so sleepy." 
Some body else will yawn out very loud, 
"Dear me, I 
wish I 
was home." 
Another will complain of 
being chilly,and so on. 
And when we contemplate : ill this we 
naturally say to ourselves, 
Oh it's all very well to be waltzing, etc. 
All around us the music is floating, 
Light and gay as the bird's happy song, 
And we sigh when the last note is over, 
Tho' we know we've been dancing too long; 
We are lost in the gladness around us, 
And we heed not the hours as they 
Till the light peeping in thro' the window, 
Makes us all bid each other good-
bye. 
SPOKEN. — Yes, we must all say good-bye at last, while we 
oympathize with each other in our misery: and go home shiver-
ing in the morning air. 
On the way we all join together and 
give vent to our feelings thus--
Oh it's all () cry well to go waluting, etc.

ANY TINWARE TO MEND. 
Written and sung by NED HARRIGAN in the sketch, Tim, the Tinker, 
FROM ould Ireland I 
lately came o'er my boys, 
And many's the shilling I've made, 
By soddering ould kettles, ould boilers and pans, 
For tinkering sure is my trade; 
At the break o' the day I 
am rising. 
On no one but myself to depind, 
All round the city I'm crying, 
Any tinware to mend. 
CHORUS. 
With my whack, whack, whack, bang, bang, bang, 
To your kettles and your pans I'll attind, 
With my whack, whack, whack, and a 
bang, bang, bang, 
Any tinware to mend. 
On Fifth avenue I 
know all the servant gals, 
An' the many a 
boiler they break. 
Its myself they call in to tinker the job, 
I'm the boy tha-
., can stop up a 
leak, 
They give me a 
big bowl c coffee, 
Thin into the street I 
Oesind, 
Their heads are all out of the window, 
Whin there's any tinware to mend. 
With my whack, whack, whack, ate. 
There's a 
young girl in Kerry that I 
well know, 
I'll bring her from over the sea, _ 
She'll be Mrs. Tooley when good Father Burke, 
Ties her completely to me; 
I'll lay down my budget and open a 
shop, 
If I 
find in my business depind, 
That I'll not be ashamed to walk ' bout the streets, 
Crying any tinware to mind. 
I'll work all my 
life for my dear little wife, 
Crying any tinware to mind.

Words by Amos D. ARNOLD. As sung by the ARNOLD BROTHERS, 
at 585 Broadway, N. Y. 
THIS season now has opened bright, 
For us to cut the wing, 
So let us now embrace this chance, 
A 
song and dance we'll sing; 
We will sling ourselves clear out of sight, 
'Way off of this plantation, 
And show you tricks you never saw 
Before in all creation. 
CHORUS. 
Oh I'm so jolly, 
And I'm in for folly, 
For we both wear the laurels now, 
And 
them we will never part, 
To sing anc7 dance here every night, 
Is just the oi ject of my heart. 
We feel like falling on our heads, 
Our feet they seem so light, 
It's easy done if you know how, 
In it we take delight: 
For sensation now and novelty, 
is all the rage and go, 
And if you'll notice us a 
while,', 
Observe this fact we know. 
Oh I'm so jolly, eta. 
I'M Paddy Miles, an Irish boy, just come across the sea, 
For singing or fpr dancing, boys, I 
think that I'll please ye ; 
I 
can sing and dance with any man, as I 
did in days of yore, 
And on Patrick's Day I 
love to wear the Hat me father wore, 
CHORUS. 
Its old, but it's beautiful—the best you ever seen; 
'Twas worn for more than ninety years in that little Isle so 
green. 
From my father's great ancestors it descended with gallore— 
It's a 
relic of old decency, is the hat me father wore. 
I 
bid you all good evening—good luck to you I 
say, 
And when I 
cross the ocean I 
hope for me you'll pray; 
I'm going to my happy land in a 
place called Ballymore, 
To be welcomed back to Paddy's land with the hat me father 
wore. 
It is old, etc. 
And when I 
do return again the boys and girls to see. 
I 
hope that with old Erin's style you'll kindly welcome me, 
With the songs of dear old Ireland to cheer me more and 
more, 
And make me Irish heart feel glad with the hat me father 
It's old, etc,

But, my darling, you will be, will be 
Always young and fair to me—

Always young and fair to me. 
Darling, I

Silver threads among the gold, 
Shine upon my brow to-day, 
Life is fading fast away— 
When your hair is silver white, 
And your cheeks no longer bright 
With the roses of the May, 
I

Oh! my darling, mine alone, alone,

Never winter's frost and chill, 
Summer warmth is in them still.

Love is always young and fair, 
What to us is silver hair, 
Faded cheeks, or steps grown slow,

You have never older grown—

You have never older grown.

With nothing on your feet: 
It's dreadful when you fancy that, 
You're going to lose your life, 
But ain't it worse than dreadful, 
When you lose your darling wife 
She would wake up in the morning, 
And she'd drag me out of bed, 
Seize hold of the poker, 
And hit me on the head; 
She'd make make me wash and iron the clothes, 
And scrub the floor as well, 
It's dreadful, ete.

And make love to my wife,

And spend my money too, 
If any one has seen her,

A little book has 1 .tely appeared in print at Messrs. Risher de

cannot 
say that we recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, 
Ps we think it would only encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
.AJnfortunately there is enough of it done without any further neces-
sity of explaining ' how, when and where to do it,' and this little 
-volume would adrise and initiate the uncorrupted in practising what 
is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: 
We have lately seen a 
neat little book, bound in morocco, costing 
25 cents, called "The Little Flirt," published by Messrs. Fisher & 
Denison, 98 Nassau street. 
It gives information of the modus oper-
andi of flirting, and of the meaning of every motion of the hand-
kerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As there is nothing at all ebjee-
. 
tionable in the volume, and its contents might afford some innocent
