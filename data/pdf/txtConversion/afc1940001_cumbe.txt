The Cumberland's CrewOh, comrades, come listen, and join in my dittyOf a terrible battle that
happened of late.Let each Union tar shed a sad tear of pityWhen he thinks of the once gallant
Cumberland's fate;On that ill fated day told a terrible story.,And many a brave tar to this world
bid adieu.Our flag it was wrapped in a mantle of gloryBy the heroic deeds of the Cumberland's
crew.On the eighth day of March about ten in the morning,Clear was the sky and bright shone the
sun;When the drums on the Cumberland sounded a warningTelling every true seaman to stand
by his guns;When an ironclad frigate down on us came bearing,And high in the air her rebel flag
flew.The pennant of treason she was proudly bearing,Determined to conquer the Cumberland's
crew.Then up spoke our brave captain with a stern resolution,"My brave boys, of this monster do not
be dismayed.We are sworn to maintain our beloved Constitution,And to die for our country we are
not afraid.We will fight for the Union, our cause it is glorious.To the stars and the stripes we will ever
prove true;We will sink at our quarters or conquer victorious."He was answered with cheers by the
Cumberland's crew. *Our noble ship opened her guns' dreadful thunder;Our bullets like hail on the
rebels did pour,But the people stood stricken with terror and wonderAs each shot struck her sides
and glanced harmlessly o'er.But the pride of our navy could never be daunted,Though the dead and
the-dying the deck did bestrew.The Star Spangled Banner above them was flying.God bless that dear
banner, the Red, White and Blue!It was slowly she sank on that dark rolling river;Their souls had
forever to earth bid adieu.But they'll be mourned by Columbia's brave sons and fair daughters,And
they'll be revenged on Virginia's dark shore.Yes, 'twas slowly she sank on that dar/k rolling river,Their
voices on earth we shall n'er hear them more.But they'll be mourned by Columbia's brave sons and
fair daughters,And they'll be revenged on Virginia's dark shore.

On the eighth day of March, about ten in the morning,The sky it was cloudless and bright shone the
sun,When the drums of the Cumberland sounded a warningThat told every seaman to stand by his
gun,When an iron-clad frigate down on us came bearing (pron. friggate )And high in the air the rebel
flag flew,And pennant of treason she was [?] so proudly was bearing,Determined to conquer the
Cumberland crew.3. Up spoke our commander with a brave resolution,Saying, "Boys, of this monster
we'll ne'er be dismayed.We are sworn to maintain our belov'd constitution,And to die for our country
we are not afraid.We'll fight for the union Union , the cause it is glorious,To the Stars and the Stripes
we will ever prove true.We will sink at our quarters or conquer victorious!"He was answered with
cheers by the Cumberland crew.4. Our noble ship opened her gun's dreadful thunderAnd broadside
like hail on those rebels did pour.But the people stood, struck with terror and wonderTo see the balls
strick her and lightly glance o'erBut the pride of our Navy will never be daunted,Though the dead and
the dying the deck did bestrew.The Star-Spangled Banner above them was flying:God bless that dear
banner, the Red White and Blue..5. She struck us amidships, our planks they did quiver,That great
iron prow pierced our wooden side through.And e'en as we sank in that dark rolling river,Their souls
then forever to earth bid adieu.She'll be wept for by Columbia's brave sons and fair daughters, [md]
May their blood be avenged on Virginia's dark shore! [md] And e'en as she sank in the depth of the
waters,Our Star-spangled Banner still bravely waved o'er.

The Cumberland Grew (fragment)'Twas the eighth day of March, about ten in the morning,The
sky it was cloudless, and bright shone the sun,When the guns of the Cumberland sounded their
warning,Told each gallant seaman to stand by his guns.There came bearing down on us an iron-
bound frigate,High on her topmast the Rebel flag flew,And the banner of treason she proudly was
wearing,Determined to conquer the Cumberland crew.
