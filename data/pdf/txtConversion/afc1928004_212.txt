BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 
OF 
DELEHANTY AND HENGLER. 
Thu pleasure we state that both Messrs. Delehanty and Hengler 
were born in the city of Albany, the capital of the Empire State, in the 
years 1846 and 1847, so that at the present time both gentlemen are in the 
prime of vigorous manhood. From their earliest childhood singing and 
dancing appeared to come to them as a 
gift of nature, and so marked were 
their instinctive abilities in that direction that their fellow citizens, appre-
ciating their premature development, familiarly spoke of them as the 
" 
funny little minstrel boys." Young in years they entered upon the pro-
fession they have ever embellished with their genius, and made extensive 
travelling tours with the most famous and select of troupes and companies. 
At times they acted as managers of leading theatres in prominent cities, 
and wherever they appeared their efforts were crowned with such well de-
served success as to enable them to command the highest salary ever be-
stowed upon performers in their particular line. 
Instead of intoxicating 
these worthy professionals with egotistical vanity, the rewards, so justly 
their due, and profusely lavished upon them, have merely inspired them 
with a 
laudable ambition to excel and to maintain their indisputably high 
position in the profession. 
Messrs. Delehanty and Hengler are the verita-
ble originals of all the legitimate styles of double songs and dances, and it 
affords them sincere gratification in presenting this collection of their 
more recent productions to the public, not alone as evidence of the origin-
ality of their talents and genius, but as proof of the improvement and ele-
vation minstrel and variety entertainments have received by reason of in-
dustry, tact, and good taste. 
Neither do they rest content with enjoyment 
of the creditable reputation they have earned; on the contrary, their cork 
goes continuously on in the production of new songs, and music of the 
choicest order in style and composition. 
Their past success having opened 
a 
wide field, it is not amazing that Messrs. Delehanty and Hengler can 
boast a 
myriad of imitators who, like all other counterfeit commodities, are 
no more like unto the originals than " Hyperion to a 
Satyr." That which 
isovith the genuine originator, chastity and good taste, degenerates in the 
hands of the bogus appropriator into vulgarity and offensiveness. 
That 
which, represented by its original performer, must be regarded as delicate, 
laugh-provoking humor, is distorted by the plagiarist into downright, low-
bred buffoonery, shocking to good manners, and ruinous to good taste. 
Such has been the general effect produced by the myriad of brainless and 
unscrupulous imitators of Delehanty and liengler's original, ingenious, 
and talented inventions, the product of genius, experience, and study. 
Messrs. Delehanty and Hengler are undeniably the people's favorites 
and the star of stars amid the constellation of variety performers. They 
have worked hard to attain their celebrity and its consequent popular 
favor ; they have deserved it, for they have earned if, and nevertheless 
they conceive it to be their bounden dutY to advance in the art of pleasing 
as the debt they owe to a 
genermi- public.

CLOG-DANCING MADE EASY. 
THE ELEMENTS AND PRACTICE OF THAT ART. 
ARRANGED , 
SIMPLIFIED , 
AND CORRECTED , 
WITH EXAMPLES. 
GENERAL ADVICE. 
BY HENRY TUCKER. 
Use clogs for all practice, as the learner will experience great 
difficulty in adapting his steps to clogs after having practised 
in shoes; the clogs having unyielding wooden soles. 
After having mastered the form of the step, practise it at any 
convenient opportunity, though it is much better to have a 
specified hour each day. 
Two hours per day is little enough 
if the student is ambitious of excellence. 
EXPLANATION OF TERMS USED IN DESCRIBING 
STEPS AND FIGURES. 
1. Tap.—Strike the floor lightly with the forward part, or 
" 
ball," of the foot. 
2. Hop.—Raise one foot and spring into the air from, and 
land on, the other foot. 
Ilufered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1874, by ROBERT M . 
DE 
W ITT, in the ° thee of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington, D. C.

CLOG- DANCING MADE EASY. 
3. Spring.—Leap or spring up from both feet at once; 
coming down, strike the feet almost, but not quite at the same 
time. 
4. Shuffle.—First draw two diagrams ( with chalk or other 
material), on the floor, similar to these, viz. : 
12 
12 
Left V 
foot. 
Right V 
foot. 
Leaving the ends about three inches apart ( see figures in dia-
gram). 
Place the heels on the angles of the diagram and then 
with both feet " tap," first No. I, then No. 2; making the 
sounds nearly at the same time. 
5. The Cross.—This step or figure, has eight motions and 
their consequent sounds, produced thus: 
1st. Tap with the left foot. 
2d. Tap with the right foot, lift it up in front, and 
3d. Hop on left foot. 
4th. Tap the right foot, crossing the left foot in front. 
5th. Touch the right heel with the toe of the left foot, then 
6th. Hop on the right foot. 
7th. Tap with the left foot, and, finally, 
8th. Bring it down firmly beside the right. 
After becoming perfectly familiar with the foregoing explana-
tions, so as to illustrate them readily by performance, the student 
can safely pass on to the following dance, all the steps of which 
are comparatively easy, having been chosen with especial re-
ference to beginners, or those who are unable to avail them-
selves of the services of a 
professional teacher.

though very simple, are somewhat more difficult as the dance 
progresses. 
We would, therefore, again call the student's at-
tention to the necessity of being perfect in each element before 
passing to the next number. 
Of course the dancer, having learned these " primary steps," 
is not compelled to follow the exact routine as given in the 
foregoing dance. 
Having mastered these, he will readily acquire or invent new 
and more elaborate ones. 
And here let us observe, that if the 
student should, at any time, find it easier, or rather, more natural, 
to start a 
figure or step in a 
manner different from that herein 
described, he had best do it by all means, as he will be much 
more likely to achieve success in it. 
Again, if, on concluding a 
step or figure, a 
graceful pose, or 
some grotesque attitude suggests itself, always adopt it, as you 
may, in this way, invent or discover a 
novelty of great value.

OPINIONS OF THE PRESS 
On the Performances of 
MESSRS. DELEHANTY AND HENGLER. 
17 
Delehanty and Hengler's Consolidatson gave an entertainment at 
Rand's Hall last evening to a 
good audience. The programme was carried 
out to the letter, in really artistic style. 
We advise our Cohoes friends to 
go and see them this evening in that city.— Times, Troy, N. Y. 
The successful engagement of Delehanty and Hengler at the Alham-
bra Theatre is drawing to a 
close, and their benefit is announced for next 
Friday evening. 
Among the performers at this theatre none have been 
received with more demonstrative favor than the beneficiaries, and they 
will naturally hope that this favor will take a 
substantial form on the oc-
casion of their benefit.—News Letter, San Francisco. 
ALHAMBRA THEATRE.—Miss Ella Wesner will make her first appear-
ance at this house this evening. 
She is said to excel Lingard in the par-
ticular specialty of comic singing and lightning changes. The child Ameri-
C113 will also appear this evening. 
This week is the last of Delehanty and 
Hengler's engagement. On Friday evening they take a 
benefit. They 
are the best in their line of business that have visited our coast, and are 
worthy of large tribute of our financial appreciation of the amusement we 
have enjoyed at their hands.—Alla California, San Francisco. 
Delehanty and Hengler continue to win golden opinions in San Fran-
cisco, Cal., as will be seen by the following extract from the News Letter of 
September 7th: " At the Alhambra Theatre, amidst the galaxy of talent, 
Messrs. Delehanty and Hengler continue to receive demonstrations of 
popular applause. 
In their latest song and dance, Where Flowers Blush 
and Bloom,' they have met with the greatest success. 
Both these actors 
are graceful and polished in their manners, and by the deep study given 
their parts they raise the profession of minstrelsy to one of the most pleas-
ing arts. 
Delehanty and Hengler's troupe gave their closing entertainment at 
Music Hall last evening to a 
large audience, notwithstanding the storm. 
It was one of the most pleasing performances with which we have been 
favored for many a 
day.—Argas, Albany, N. V. 
ONE NIGHT MOItE.—It was a 
natural sequence that, after all the 
pleasant things said by press and public of Delehanty and Hengler's en-
tertainment at the Portland Theatre, Friday night, there should be a 
good 
house. 
But we must confess that we did not expect such a 
rush en masse. 
The auditorium was literally packed, and many scores were turned away. 
'Phe performance gave entire satisfaction, and the success of the troupe 
here has been s 
D 
marked, and the desire to see them one night more was 
so heartily expressed that the management concluded to cancel their en-
gagement at Biddeford to-night and remain in Portland. They offer for 
this evening a 
very choice programme, embracing the gems of the previous 
entertainments, with several new things. We predict for them another 
crowded a 
Inlitorium. 
It is one of the most pleasint., sh ,,Nrs that has ever 
held forth here.— Argus, Pr,rtlon(I, 31e.

LITTLE ROSIE MAY, 
Oh, the summer has come, 
With flowers in bloom, 
The birds sing out their lay ; 
Where the grass grows green, 
My rt)se is seen, 
A 
walking day by day. 
She has a 
roguish jet black eye, 
Which brightens when I 
say, 
I 
love but you, and only you, 
My II tle Rosie May. 
CHORUS. 
My little Rosie May, 
None was e'er so gay, 
For her voice is sweet, and she dresses neat, 
My little Rosie May. 
You should have seen 
This little queen, 
A walking down Broadway. 
With a 
winning smile, 
And a 
pleasing style, 
To steal your heart away. 
The gents they turn to ! ook at her, 
And this is what they say, 
She's a 
charming belle, 
And she knows it m 
ell, 
My little Rosie May. 
My little Rosie May, (ie. 
Now I 
take Miss Rose 
To all the shows, 
To parties and to ride; 
And where e'er I 
be, 
You are sure to see, 
Miss Rosie by my side. 
She can sing a 
song, 
Or dance a 
jig, 
The piano she can play; 
There is none so fair, 
None can compare. 
With little Rosie May. 
My little Rosie May, 40

MOONLIGHT AT CAPE MAY 
Oh! my poor heart is not my own, 
ft was stolen by a 
charming girl, 
Whose eyes are black and full of love 
And her teeth as white as pearl. 
How we first met I'll now tell you: 
'Twas to me such a 
happy day : 
'was down on the beach, in the evening, 
In the moonlight at Cape May. 
CHORUS. 
How sweet to me this girl did seem, 
The dear one of my happy dream— 
She's such a 
little beauty, 
Like a 
butterfly light and gay. 
I 
met her on the beach, in the evening, 
In the moonlight at Cape May. 
Oh ! she was gazing calml . , 
As the waves rolled near her feet; 
She turned her head as I 
came by: 
Then, of course, our eyes did meet. 
We spoke about the sweet moonlight, 
While the hours they passed away. 
As we walked, I 
was so happy, 
In the moonlight at Cape May. 
How sweet to me, ctc. 
Next evening as I 
passed the house, 
I 
called my love to see ; 
And side by side we rambled on, 
It was hours of bliss to me. 
I 
asked her if she would have me: 
"For I 
love you," I 
did say. 
She promised then to be my wif 
In the moonlight at Cape May. 
How sweet to me, &e.

SENEGABIBIAN GAMBOLS. 
Happy little Nigs are we, 
Just as gay as gay can be; 
Always laughing and never sigh, 
Twist our heels and wink our eye. 
CHORUS. 
Den see this motion, 
Dat's my notion, 
Happy little Darkies, 
And we'll have you all to know, 
With the scientific movement, 
Of de heel and toe, 
All the world is the same to me, 
Joy in everything we see; 
Bright or cloudy, wet or dry, 
Always laughing, and never cry. 
Den see this !flOti011, tke 
Den at night when day's work's done, 
That's the time we have our fun, 
Den we're happy Lght and free, 
Sorrow never comes to we.

Thies my notion, 
Happy little Darkies, 
And we'll have you all to know, 
With the scientific movement, 
Of de heel and toe.

WALKING IN THE STARLIGHT. 
Walking in the starlight, 
Some one by my side; 
While that some one's arm was hitched to mine, 
No one heard us talking. 
We were all alone, 
When my darling said, forever thine. 
Walking not on Broadway, 
Nor in the City Park, 
We wandered, thoughtless, for away from home. 
'Twas out among the forest trees, 
Beside a 
running brook, 
We spoke about the happy days to come. 
CHORUS—Oh, yes, I 
was in ectaey, 
She was all the world to me, 
She said she loved me more than once, 
Which did my heart inspire, 
I 
called her Rose, the pink of beaux, 
She's all that I 
desire. 
While in conversation, 
Rosie, with a 
sigh; 
Asked me if I 
ever was in love? 
I 
answered, ' No, my darling, 
Never until now; 
I 
vow it, by the little stars above." 
Then, like one awaking. 
From a 
happy dream; 
While her cheeks were blushing rosy red, 
"May your love grow stronger, 
To equal mine for you," 
And that is all my little darling said. 
Oh, yes, etc. 
Holding on the door knob, 
Bidding sweet good night, 
Never felt so happy in my life. 
Happy not at parting, 
But what my darling said, 
When I 
asked her would she be my wife, 
" 
Yes, with all my heart, love, 
When I 
am of age; 
I 
am seventeen to-morrow, you must know, 
Wait a 
little longer, 
Just another year." 
Next Sunday makes it just a 
year. 
Oh, yes, etc,

WHERE FLOWERS BLUSH AND BLOOM. 
Words and Music by Wm. H. 
DELEHANTY. 
I 
took a 
walk in Spring time 
To 
while away the hours, 
And chanced to see a 
maiden, 
A sprinkling budding flowers ; 
In a 
handsome little garden, 
Around a 
cottage home, 
Where Cupid's ever lurking, 
And flowers blush and bloom. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, she's the fairest of the fair, 
Like a 
jewel rich and rare ; 
I 
saw her in the garden, 
Mid roses' sweet perfume, 
And felt the dart of Cupid 
Where flowers blush and bloom. 
I 
often pass the cottage, 
In hopes that I 
may see 
This charming little creature, 
The dearest one to me. 
For I 
feel that I 
have won her, 
And hope the day will come 
That makes her mine forever, 
Where flowers blush and bloom. 
Oh, she's the fairest, tiLe. 
Oh, yes, I'm very happy, 
I'll meet my love to-night, 
And that's the very reason 
I'm dancing with delight. 
Fate doomed her as my partner, 
And that shall be quite soon, 
We'll know no care nor sorrow, 
Where flowers blush and bloom. 
Oh, she's the fairest, & c.

BLACK ARISTOCRATS. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
OH, two black aristocrats are we, 
And depend upon our style, 
To take us into high society; 
Of course we're thin, but that's no sin, 
As long as we are gay, 
Our parents tell us we were born 
In Southern Africa. 
Oh my brother Ike and I 
are bloods, 
At least the people say, 
And more than that the ladies' pet and joy; 
They say we're black but what of that, 
Each dog must have his day, 
Like us two black aristocrats 
From Southern Africa. 
SHAKE YOUR DUSTY WINGS. 
LUKE SCHOOLCRAFT'S Original Plantation Song. 
SHAKE your dusty wings bright and early in the mornino-,

Shake your dusty wings bright and early in the mornin ,-, 
I

When I'm gone don't you grieve after me, 
When I'm gone don't you grieve after me, 
When I'm gone don't you grieve after me, 
I

MY NANCY FAIR. (CONCLUDED.' 
I 
went there dress'd in all my best, 
As folks are bound to do; 
A 
bright blue coat, an orange vest, 
And rose of crimson hue; 
My income isn't large, you know, 
So at the fair I'd none to spare; 
But still I 
got on nicely till 
I 
saw my Nancy there. 
Spoken.—Yes, there was the dear girl— 
OLIORIIS.—Ily Nancy fair, a. 
I 
loved my Nancy more than life, 
But if she'd loved me too, 
To ruin me at fancy fairs 
Was not the thing to do; 
She made me purchase at her stall 
A 
guinea doll, a 
parasol, 
And wooden parrot that you squeezed 
To croak out " Pretty poll." 
Clumps.- -My Nancy fair, &c. 
She talked about the naked blacks, 
And infant nigger boys, 
And how they ran about the streets 
Without their eorderoys; 
But when she'd cleared my pockets out, 
With face of gloom I 
heard my doom; 
She said quite fiercely, " Pray, move on, 
And don't take up the room." 
Spoken.—Didn't I 
bless the horrid little niggers at CI 
Aint there enough blacks in London flying about f 
Oh 
Cnonus.—My Nancy fair, ctc. 
A 
ruined man, I 
blessed the blacks, 
And left the wretched place, 
And never since that day have I 
Beheld my Nancy's face; 
Although they call them fancy fairs, 
They're not ideal, but very real; 
Then when you visit fancy fairs, 
Be careful how you deal. 
Caoaus.—My Nancy fair, Arc.

IT'S FUNNY WHEN YOU FEEL THAT WAY. 
As sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
I 
SHAN'T forget how queer I 
felt when first I 
fell in love, 
I 
had a 
most severe attack through squeezing a 
lady's glove. 
Her lovely hand was in it as I 
danced with her so gay, 
I 
thought myself in paradise—it's funny when you feel that 
way. 
ClIORUS, 
I 
felt as tho' I'd tumbled into honey, and some one had left me 
all their money. 
The feeling's so peculiar and funny, it's funny when you feel 
that way. 
I 
took her down to supper, and sat down by her side, 
I 
helped her to the ices, and filled her glass with pride, 
In fact paid such attention, that she viewed me with dismay, 
I 
moved my chair so close to hers, it's funny when you feel that 
way. 
I 
felt as tho', etc. 
We met again one afternoon, and as we were alone, 
I 
plucked up nerve to ask her if some day she'd be my own; 
She blushed and said, go see papa and ask him if I 
may, 
I 
danced the cancan round the room, it's funny when you feel 
that way. 
I 
felt as tho', etc. 
The old man said that we might wed and so he crowned our 
bliss, 
And I 
shall be a 
married man in about a 
month from this. 
It seems as though the time, somehow, would never pass away, 
I 
long to hear those wedding bells, it's funny when you feel 
that way.

THE JOLLY CATS.

Hum% 
AIR— Jolly Dog& 
There are a 
lot of jolly cats, 
That often meet at night, 
To hold a 
comcert on the tiles, 
Or else to squall and fight. 
CHORUS. 
And they always are so noisy, oh, 
So noisy oh, so noisy oh, 
They always are so noisy, oh, 
Whilst on the tiles they be. 
They fight, they bite, 
They swear and tear each other's hair, 
They call, they squall, 
Such noisy cats are they. 
With their mot, row, row, mol, row, row, 
Mol row, row, mol row, row, and 
Kwatchk, ph utt! there they are agr, a, 
There they are again, there they are again, 
Ksvatclik I 
phutt! there they are again. 
Such jolly cats are they. 
They kick up such a 
jolly row, 
In vain to sleep I 
tries, 
Their little claws I'm sure were made 
To scratch each other's eycs 
For they always, & c. 
They wander round the chimney pots, 
And climb the water spout, 
And oft I 
have to throw a 
brick, 
To put them to the rout. 
And they always, 
To watch their gambols and their pranks 
Sometimes is jolly fun, 
Although I 
never shot the cat, 
[ 
mean to buy a 
gun. 
For they always. 
They drink our milk and steal our meat, 
And think it not a 
crime, 
Lad when they bring forth kittens, 
They come fi!ty at a 
time.

On my, we feel so happy, 
We don't know what to do,

When flinging up the shoe; 
We bother all the neighbors,

We turn the pigs out • 
Just for to

Together—Just see how good we feel, 
When slippery as an eel, 
From our head down to our heel. 
Oh now, let's make it lively, 
For we must cut and run; 
We'll meet again to-morrow, 
By the setting ot the sun ; 
We'll tie the cat's tail to the dog, 
To hear dent mew and squall, 
And take de old cow's photograph, 
And paint it on de wall.

It's nearly time for me to go ; 
So, Ladies and Gents, to please I've tried. 
And I 
hope that you are all satisfied. 
But now before I

I'll try to give you a 
Clog-Hornpipe.

SONO AND DANCE. 
OF 
all the lively colored folks, 
That's in this country round, 
There's no one half so handy 
As this nigger you be bound. 
I 
dance from dark till daylight, 
And my cognomen is Sam— 
This Slim and Slippery Southern Nig, 
From Sunny Alabam. 
CHORUS. 
See me dance and slide about, 
I 
turn myself near wrong side out, 
I 
hope that you are satisfied, 
For I'm the ladies' man, 
This Slim and Slippery Southern Nig, 
From Sunny Alabam. 
Singing is my chief delight, 
Of dancing I 
never tire, 
The way I 
throw myself around 
You'll say I'm hung on wire, 
I'm my mother's only joy, 
My father's name was Ham, 
So watch the antic tricks 
Of this Nig from Alabam. 
See me dance, etc. 
NUMBER SEVEN SHOE. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
THE subject of my song is not so very new, 
'Tis of a 
handsome yellow gal I 
love so fond and true, 
Her eyes are black as night, so black they're almost blue, 
And her foot is just the size to fit a 
number seven shoe. 
CHORUS . 
For she's as gentle as a 
turtle dove, 
And her name is Araminta Susan Brown, 
She dresses like a 
belle and she loves this darkey well, 
She's the nobbiest gal that promenades the town. 
I 
pay for all her clothes, and she has 'em made in style, 
She never drinks a 
drop, but often takes a 
smile, 
She dances like a 
sylph, and looks so gay and neat, 
As she shakes a 
jig to pieces, with her number seven feet. 
For she's, etc. 
I 
asked the other day if she would marry me, 
She said she couldn't tell me then, but if I'd wait she'd see, 
I 
pressed my suit so eagerly, she didn't know what to do, 
But she said she'd have me if I'd take her number seven shoe. 
For she's, etc.

I'm the mad butcher, ch. 
She smiled on me one afternoon, 
I 
grew hot and cold by degrees; 
I 
told her my love very soon, 
In the sawdust I 
knelt on my knees; 
But she spuru'd me and then what was more, 
I 
know you will say it was too bad, 
She married the tailor next door, 
And ever since then I've been mad. 
Spoken.—Mad! stark, staring mad! 
She married the ninth 
part of a 
man! a tailor in preference to me, but I 
had re-
venge—he took her abroad to Ilighbury, and there she got pos-
session of all his hard-earu'd savings, and she lavished it away 
upon dress, she bought a 
chignon and she practiced the Grecian 
Bend, and then she paid a 
lot of little boys to say 
He's the mad butcher, ch. 
One day I'd a 
furious shock, 
I 
hack'd and chopped up the meat; 
At one blow I 
sever'd the block, 
And I 
pitched the sheep's heads in the street-
By turns I 
now laugh and then cry, 
But somehow I've lost all my trade: 
I 
cry, buy, buy, the, buy, buy, buy, buy, 
But my customers all seem afraid. 
Spoken.—Yes,, and I'm as quiet as a 
lamb, I 
wouldn't hurt a 
worm, but they exne round the shop and pick up the block orna-
ments, theu look up to know the price; directly they see me 
remain silent, not a 
word, but I 
can read their thougtts, that— 
I'm the mad butcher, kc.

And when each dance is finished, 
We take a

Oh she's a

She is, on my honor, so handsome and fine,

Oh ! list to us, and see if we ain't right, sir:

A NORRI-BULL TALE.—NoNcLUDED. 3 
They never let no daylight in 
Their dwelling, which you'll say's a 
sin, 
But just like mice they stalk'd about, 
And never show'd their noses out; 
This miserable doleful lot. 
From wuss to wusser daily got, 
Until at last a 
form they plamfd, 
They each should die by their own hand.—CnoRty.s 
The father into the garden did stroll, 
And blow'd out his brains with a 
sausage roll ; 
The mother, seeing what he'd done, 
Stabb'd herself with a

Soon arter which the oldest boy 
Shot himself with a 
saveloy ; 
The youngest daughter, Mary Ann, 
Garotted herself with the frying-pan.---CuortuA. 
Tha little boy, just turned six, 
Swallow'd a

Run himself through with the stable- broom ; 
The housemaid into the house did rush, 
And cut her throat with a

The infant child, just turned two, 
Drowned himself in an Irish stew ; 
But one was left, and he, adack! 
Hung himself with the roasting-jack;

HANDSOME DICK THE MUFFIN MAN. 
In Belgrave Square there liv'd a 
maid, 
Her name was Susan, it was said, 
And parlor maid she long had been 
To a 
rich old gent called Squire Green. 
The coachman tried her heart to win, 
But his fellow- servants, with a 
grin, 
Cried, " Ah, there's no chance for you, Dan 
For Susan loves her muffin Man." 
CHORUS. 
'With his curly hair and handsome nose 
He really was the pink of beaux— 
Find such another few girls can, 
As handsome Dick the Muffin Man. 
Dick called one day to see his Sue, 
And what befel I'll tell to you, 
The master came home unawares, 
Poor Susan bolted down the stairs, 
Crying, " Cookee, I'm in such a 
tright, 
Here's master coining home nearly tight, 
Do cookee, pray devise sonic plan, 
To save my handsome muffin man." 
With his curly hair, &o. 
Now cook was tall and fat, you see, 
Antt dearly loved a 
jolly spree— 
She dressed I ) ick up in woman's clothes, 
And be looked a 
strapper, goodness knows. 
But Dan the coac..man found it out, 
And out of pure revenge no doubt, 
With his s'ory to the master ran, 
To betray poor Dick the muffin man. 
With his curly hair, &..c 
The master to the kitchen hied, 
And Dick in ferns] • dress espied, 
He vowed lie honored female charms, 
Then round poor Dick he threw his arms— 
Dick didn't like the kissing part, 
So for the stairs he made a 
start, 
lie gained the streets, when a 
race began 
After handsome Dick the muffin man. 
Wi‘h Ma curly hair, dm 
Pick ran as if for life or death, 
But lie was caught when out of breath, 
By brave policeman ninety-eight, 
And Went before a 
magistrate : 
As Dick had done no harm, why he 
Was quickly set at at liberty ; 
And Susan, as the story ran, 
Was married to her muffin man.

Oh the rainbow is pretty in the sky, 
And a

They are very handsome things to view, 
But perhaps to see this girl you would 
ay she's the prettiest of all, 
if by chance you ever should, 
In love with her you'd fall. '

And what do you think he said ? 
Wait one year— then he'd agree, 
That she and I

acquiesced, on being press'd, 
They all seem'd quite delighted; 
Myself I 
dress'd in very best,

THE WATER PARTY.--[CoNctuvEn.] 
At eight o'clock we hired a 
boat, 
Our hampers, in we stows 'em, 
And very soon we were afloat, 
On Father Thames's bosom; 
At Putney Bridge, young Snooks turned pale, 
And gave a 
reglar start, he 
Vowed he had just seen a 
whale, 
Which frightened all the party.—Ctioilus. 
But very soon we understood, 
As true as I'm a 
liver, 
It won't a 
whale, but logs of wood, 
A- floating down the river; 
Brown 'stead of rowing, was intent 
On the charms of Miss McCarthy, 
lie " caught a 
crab," and over went 
To the anguish of the party !—Cnoatts. 
He floundered like a 
fish about, 
We did our best to aid him, 
Until at last we got him out, 
And in the boat we laid him; 
As he was damp, it damped our luck, 
When stupid Teddy Smart, he 
Steered in the mud, and there we stuck, 
Which did disgust the party.—Cmuzus, 
How we ourselves could extricate, 
We'd no means of discernine-. 
We'd nothing else to do, but wait 
Until the tide was turning; 
At t!ri at night, we got off right, 
Expressed our thanks so hearty, 
And homeward rowed, with all our might, 
To end the water party.—Cuouns. 
At Putney Bridge, we met a 
shock, 
And greatly it surprised us, 
The bridge against our boat did knock, 
And smash'd it, and capsized us! 
We were fished out, while folks did shout, 
And laughed at us so hearty, 
Ycwill do me good when I 
go out 
A 
gain with the water party --Ctiorws.

DASHING THROUGH THE SNOW. 
Dashing through the snow in a

Over the hills we go singing all the day ; 
Bells on the bob tail ring, making spirits bright, 
Oh I

sleighing song to- night,

Jingle Bells I 
Jingle all the day, 
Oh 1

A day or two ago, the story I 
will tell, 
I 
went out on the snow and on my back I 
fell; 
A 
gent was riding by in a 
one horse open, sleigh, 
He laughed as there I 
sprawling lay but quickly rode away. 
Jingle Bells, itc, 
Now the ground is white, go iC while you're young, 
ITake the girls to- night and sing a

Just get a

Hitch him to an open sleigh and Crack you'll take the lead.

DON'T YOU GRIEVE AFTER ME. 
End Song by HARRY K ERNELL. 
I 
once knew a 
girl, her name was Susy Horner, 
She is of light complexion and she lives around the corner, 
I 
told her that I 
loved her, she said was a 
goner, 
I 
told her not to grieve alter me. 
C 
HORUS. 
When I 
am gone, I 
told her not to grieve, 
When I 
am gone, SYMPHOWYd 
When I 
am gone I 
told her not to grieve, 
Oh, I 
told her not to grieve after me. 
Oh, Susan says to me, I 
want your hand in marriage, 
She put her hand in her pocket to pay for the carriage; 
Den I 
says, Susy, I'll pay for the ferriage, 
But don't you grieve after time. 
'When I 
am gone, (tc 
I 
kissed her three times, then she began to cry, 
She had a 
blubber on her cheek, and a 
tear in her eye.

says, Susy dear, I'll be back bye and bye. 
Oh, don't you grieve after me.

WAKING at early day, 
Gayly I 
take my way, 
Trilling some ancient lay, 
As I 
stroll along; 
Youthful hearts I 
cheer, 
Age delights to hear, 
Gay and grave draw near 
While I 
sing my song. 
Far I've been on distant strand, 
Where Christian warriors fell; 
Many a 
tale of I

To gentle dames I 
tell. 
Waking at early day, Arc. 
Humble though be my fare, 
Health is a 
boon I 
share, 
Little I 
dream of care, 
As tlrrough life I 
go ! 
None my steps molest, 
If fatigued, opprest, 
'Neath some tree I 
rest— 
And there forget my woe. 
All some kindness show to me, 
AVhere'er I 
chance to roam; 
Though a 
wandering life I 
lead, 
I 
always find a 
home.

WHEN ALL THIS UPROAR.—[CoNcLuDED.] 
Once I 
was single and happy, 
Leading a 
bachelor's life, 
Gone are my latch-key and chambers, 
Now I 
am bless'd with a 
wife ; 
Mother-in-law came to see us, 
Then little twins came to town, 
They and the nurse and the doctor 
Turn all the place up-side down.—Cno. 
When all the danger is over 
I 
shall be visiting France, 
Though till it's perfectly quiet 
Not a 
step will I 
advance; 
As for the Commune's supporters, 
I 
can soon sum up the lot, 
Patriots, noisy and dirty, 
Running at sound of a 
shot.—Cuo. 
When I 
go out to a 
party, 
Though all the girls are divine, 
I 
never go in for dancing, 
Whist is much more in my line ; 
Some people consider it pleasure, 
Whirling around in a 
swarm, 
Making them giddy and bilious, 
Moist and unpleasantly warm.—OHO. 
Say, in a 
fete day at Sydenham, 
Where is the joy to be found? 
Old women, muslin, and baskets, 
Pork-pies and babies abound; 
Children get lost by the dozen, 
Some tumble into the lake, 
Wives grow ill-temper'd, and husbands 
Far too much beverage take.—Cno. 
Some folks crowd into a 
theatre, 
Pushing and struggling so, 
I, when the uproar is over, 
After them quietly go; 
"What is the use of such bother ? 
What is the good of this strife ? 
Taking such trouble is needless 
On the short journey of life.—Cno.

There's some to:ks borrow trouble,

And don't know what to do ; 
But we're a

Who don't make any fuss, 
And in this little song and dance,

Jump ' round, break down, 
Twist your ankle thus. 
Don't you ever be afraid. 
To bet your stamps on tr. 
There are some folks kind of airy, 
Who blow and talk quite loud, 
They would not notice common folks,

For whether school it keeps or not, 
You can bet your stamps on us.

But take things as they come;

Her eyes were azure blue, 
Admirers she had plenty,

She was very fond of dancing, 
But allow me to remark, 
That one fine day she danced away, 
With a 
calico printers clerk. 
At a 
private ball I 
met her, 
In eighteen sixty-three, 
I 
never can forget her, 
Though she was unkind to me; 
I 
was dressed in pink of fashion, 
My lavender gloves were new, 
I 
danced the valse Circassian, 
With charming Dorothy Drew. 
She was very, &c..

We valsed and we mazourka'd, 
Till she valsed my heart away ;

STILL I AM NOT HAPPY.—[CoNcLuDED.] 
When big enough to go to school, they sent me far away, 
Where all was work and drudgery, and never any play; 
No marbles, tops, no kites or hoops allowed were, but such sums 
Were set us, and small exercise for our poor teeth and gums. 
We had of meat the smallest cut, of drink the weest drappie, 
I 
almost died from hunger, but-but still I 
was not happy. 
Before I 
left, as a 
reward for never telling lies, 
The stern head-master handed me a 
volume as a 
prize; 
'Twits bound in calf, with pages gilt, ' twas beavyish to lift; 
At length, thought I, is happiness, as I 
beheld the gift; 
All tremblingly I 
opened it, alas 
this eager chap he 
Read Martin Farquhar Tupper's works, and still I 
was not happy.

party's purse, 
The sentence passed upon me was ridiculously terse; 
They locked me up, cut off my hair, my " backy," and my rappee, 
And put me on the treadmill, where-where st:II I 
was not hapi y. 
I 
married three years back a 
wife, but found I'd been deceived, 
The property did not exist in which I 
had believed; 
Her mother pays short visits of just seven mouths or so, 
Her six big sisters come in turn, bu never seem to go; 
Five brothers daily dine, and tell all new that's in the tapis, 
They kindly stop to tea as well, but still I 
am not happy. 
rye speculated right and left, in bank and railway shares, 
But in each instance have they proved most ruinous affairs. 
I 
always tread on orange peel, or slides made in the guttet, 
And if my bread and butter falls, it's always on the butter. 
I 
get run over in the street, and cabmen call me " sappy," 
I 
digest nothing that I 
eat, and still I 
am not happy. 
I've failed in trade-the doctor says I'm " going to be ill." 
To-morrow I 
must come to grief through backing Walker's " Bill." 
My pipes have burst, my chimney smokes, my rent's long overdue, 
There's one man in possession now, to-morrow there'll be two. 
But crowning bliss of all! my wife has left off being snappy, 
And vows she'll 4 atick to me through life," but stih I

THE YOUNG GIRL OF THE PERIOD. 
She's one that will shirk from all kinds of work, 
But will read each new romance and sonnet.; 
Witirs feathers and frills, like porcupine quills, 
Stuck around in a 
piece of a 
bonnet. 
She loves to ' tend balls, she loves to make calls, 
She always looks faded and wearied ;

She's of the same stripe, a 
very good type, 
Of the present young girl of the period. 
cnoaus. 
The truth I 
must speak., tho' sickly and weak, 
Of one thing she never gets wearied ; 
It's " gadding " the street, where often you'll meet, 
With this " gushing '' young girl of the period. 
With " chignons " and " rats " 'neath smallest of hats, 
With a 
pannier assisting to " bend " her: 
With cheeks cherry red, tho' painted 'tis said, 
With a 
look very " gushing ' and tender. 
If old " Rip-van- wink,' should wake up I 
think, 
The people by him should be queried, 
To know whence she came, and what T.vas the name. 
Of this dashing young girl of the period. 
The truth I 
must speak, 
She marries a 
man as soon as she can, 
And in most cases weds him for money ; 
And twixt you and I, she'll make it to fly, 
That. he'll think it arnazinoly funny. 
To be a 
good wife, is such a 
dull life, 
Of house-keeping she becomes wearied; 
Then " Hubby " will find, he must have been MIMI. 
When he wed thi.s young girl of the period.

YE STORY OF HIGH PRICES ;

Oh, dear me! these are troubleus times, 
There really is no seem' 
Which is the best locality 
" 
To be or not to be in." 
Tax gatherers stand on ey'ry hand, 
With arms outstretched to collar uS; 
And take away our dimes. by means 
Of which our miens are Dolorous. 
And it's oh! dear, oh! 
We're all going up in a 
Balloon 
As high as we can go. 
On ev'ry side there seems to glPe 
A spirit of dejection; 
To think the only food that's cheap 
is food for our reflection. 
But if things should much higher go, 
To reach them we'll he flustered ; 
For we'll only just be " wor Ii our salt," 
When all our funds are Mustered. 
And it's oh! dear, oh! &, e. 
But our consciences are getting seared, 
Each day we grow more callous : 
Our gals are all less buoyous, 
And our boys all more gallus. 
And that the wife, to husband her supplies, 
Finds it hew ilderin' 
Whilst the father finds his " Uncle" 
Is apparent to the Children. 
And it's oh! dear, oh ' 
There's not a 
business in the land 
But of the times afraid is ; 
And even Hackney Coachmen say 
It's at a 
stand their trade is. 
And milkmen, when we ask for cream, 
All tell us we must stop a

Because the milk has " viz" so high

YE STORY OF HIGH PRICES.— LCoNcLUDED. 
The Butchers' trade is out of joint, 
lie's cut up past revealing ; 
And half inclined to drown himself; 
And sink the awful feeling. 
Chopfallen thus the Stake, to lose 
His " rib " grows spare and slender; 
Wi th " heaps " of little tender loins 
hut nary legal tender. 
And it's oh! dear, oh!&o, 
The Baker rolls his eyes, and twists 
His head at doleful " Clackers ;" 
But never in his fancy bred 
Such times as these for Crackers. 
And tho' he's not a

To a

For he finds that oftener than his dough 
It is a

To attempt a

"Dead men's shoes" relief are giving. 
The Doctors lose their patience 
And for physic— they might make it; 
And " throw it to the Dogs,' but well 
They know the dogs won't take it. 
And it's oh! dear,ohl 
They've taxed our stages and our cars, 
Our steamboats on our rivers; 
They've taxed our lights, and probably 
They mean to tax our livers. 
And Washington Miss Nancy's, 
With their single eye, it may be ; 
Will tax our wives, or make us get 
A license for a— Baby. 
And it's oh! dear, oh 
But where's the use of grumbling 
At the fiddler or the fifer ; 
When it's well known that all who dance 
Must surely pay the piper. 
So let's support the Government, 
And cry, " Long live the President ;"

THE YORKSHIRE FARMER. 
As sung by JAMES TAYLOR, Champion Comique of the world. 
I 
am a 
jolly old farmer man, 
And go by the name of Yorkshire Sam; 
Hale and hearty too, I 
am, 
As you may plainly see. 
I 
remember well when I 
used to prance, 
And join in the merry village dance ; 
But I'm not so young as I 
used to be, 
About forty years ago. 
The boys and girls of the village say, 
Whenever I 
happen to pass that way ; 
There's good old Sam, the farming man, 
Hurray I 
hurray ! hurray I 
About forty years ago, my boys, 
I 
took Invs4M a 
wife ; 
And she has been a 
boon to me, 
And the comfort of my life. 
I 
remember well, when she used to say, 
it's a 
pity to let time slip away ; 
But we're not so young as we used to be, 
About forty years ago. 
The boys and girls, Lc:, 
I 
remember well in the harvest time, 
When we used to mow the hay ; 
We used to get our home-brewed ale, 
in the bottle every day. 
Them were the times to enjoy one's self, 
There wasn't so much grinding after pelf; 
But remember I 
am speaking of 
Sum' forty years ago.

PLAYING HOOKEY. 
Sung by SHERIDAN sad mAcK. 
We're as happy, just as happy as can be, 
We're full of fun, my little Sue and me, 
We ran away from school to-day, 
And oh, we had suc't fun: 
Playing hookey from the school, 
I 
know is against the rule, 
But we don't care, when we got there, 
The school it was begun. 
CHORUS. 
I 
don't care, I 
don't care. 
Do you, my little Sue, 
You know I 
don't, ycu know I 
don't, 
l'm happy when with you. 
(Repeat.) 
First we went and got some cherries in the rood, 
And I'll bet you they tasted good, 
And then we went down to the pond, 
And with the ducks did play; 
Then Jimmy climbed an apple tree, 
And threw all the cherries down to me, 
But a 
great big dog he chased us, 
Oh,. didn't he frighten me. 
I 
don't care. d:c.

For I'm engaged to a 
lovely girl and true to her I'll be.

THE COMET OF THE WEST. 
Sung by the GREAT LINGARD. 
1.1II the comet of the Nvest, 
In the shade I 
put the rest, 
All others are my sat elites, you see, 
But mooning s 
not my game, 
I've my way to fame, 
And they all have to stand aside for me. 
CHORUS. 
Shout, boys, shout, and let's be jolly, 
Stand aside and let this swell go past. 
I 
like to do the grand with a 
shcrt cane in my hand, 
For. by Jove, you see the comet's come at last; 
In Fifth Avenue I 
shine, 
With this taking way of mine, 
And if in Central Park I 
chance to ride, 
My horse holds up his head, 
As though he proudly said— 
" 
The comet comes ! you fellows stand aside." 
Shout, boys, shout, &a 
At a 
theatre or a 
ball, 
Or at supper one and all, 
To stand aside. for me find it best, 
For my most impressive way 
Puts them down and seems to say— 
" 
Stand aside, I 
am the comet of tl.e west 1" 
Shout. boys. shout. ate. 
If by chance I'm at a 
rl:ce, 
In the stand I 
get a 
place, 
No matter what the crowd or who are there, 
It will always be my pride, 
That I 
make them stand aside, 
There' s 
no resisting my important air. 
Shout, boys, shout, &c. 
Every greenroom I 
do know, 
Behind the scenes I 
often go, 
And I 
always come off better than the rest; 
The ballet all know me, 
And each pretty star you see 
Is attra.cted by the comet of the west. 
Shout, boys, shout, &c. 
Though other stars may fall, 
I 
shine brighter than them all, 
And the comet's shining splendor fs its pride. 
Your applause then kindly lend, 
For my tale is at an end. 
The ekant-t of the west comes, stand aside.

THE WANDERING CONTRABANDS 
Composed by FATTIE STEWART. 
Here we are as you can see, 
Two wandering contrabands, 
We just arrived from Tennessee, 
Ou • names is Jake and Sam. 
We usad to work for Dr. White, 
Among the hemp and corn, 
We used to have our fun at night 
And go to work at dawn. 
CHORUS. 
White folks, just look at us, 
Our names is Jake and Sam, 
We'r,• all the way from Tennessee, 
Two wandering contrabands. 
When we worked for Dr. White, 
We got enough to elt, 
Plenty clothes upon our back, 
And shoos upon our feet. 
But, oh ! the things are different now, 
S 
nee us poor darks are free, 
And don't we wish that we were back, 
In good old Tennessee. 
Then give us back our Sugar Cane, 
Cotton and the corn, 
And give us back the spot we love, 
The cot where we were born. 
We've looked for work all over town, 
Stopped every one we meet, 
And now we're forced to sing and dance, 
To get something to eat. 
So, kind folks, all take pity, pray, 
Extend the helping hand, 
And give a 
stake, to me and Jake, 
Two wandering contrabands. 
Now, if you've anything to give, 
Just hand to Sam and me, 
We only want enong•It to t 
t's Lack to TenneEtee.

YOU'LL HEAR NO NOISE. 
Sung by SHERIDAN and M ACK. 
Here we are, two merry boys, 
Full of life and fun, 
Singing. dancing every night, 
When our work is done ; 
The people everywhere we go, 
Call us their favorite boys, 
And when we sing and dance for them, 
We never make a 
noise. 
CIIORUS. 
Just watch the way we throw our ieet. [spit .1 
Our dancing is so very neat, ;
8yrn.] 
Oh, how we love to sing and dance, 
'Tis one of life's best joys, 
You can see our feet move up and down, 
But you'll never hear a 
noise. 
To balls and parties we do go, 
And with the ladies flirt, 
Oh, ain't they nice young fellows, 
The girls they all assert; 
The other gents get jealous 
And say we're fast young boys, 
They envy us because we sing 
And dance without a 
noise. 
Just watch the way, 6;c. 
I 
think there's some one calling us, 
So kind friends we must go 
We're sorry we must leave, 
But we've other work to do ; 
When you come some other time, 
You'll always find us boys, 
Ready to sing and dance for you, 
But you'll never hear a 
noise. 
Just watch the way, ,k,c.

YOU SHOULD SEE %HEN DANCE AT THE GAY 
11.IABILLE. 
My name is spicy George, 
A Whitechapel Coster—that's me, 
I've made so much money with turnips and beans, 
I 
thought I'd go on a 
spree ; 
Not drinking with pAs in the East, 
But something a 
little genteel, 
So pacIt'd up my clothes— off to Paris I 
went 
To visit the gay Mabille. 
Spoken— Arrived in Paris, done the Whitechapel heavy in a 
most 
respectable style until I 
reached the place where— 
CHORUS. 
You should see them dance. 
At the gay Mabille, 
Zg, zig, zig, song, song, song, 
ever, never stilt—zig! 
When I 
arriv'd in France, 
There was no fellows dress'd like me, 
The swells they thought this Whitechapel cut, 
Was the fashion that was to be, 
I 
look'd round about for a " pub !" 
But no public-house could I 
see. 
I 
long'd for a 
quart of my English beer, 
But I 
had to drink coffee and tea. 
Spoken—Cruelty to animals, no beer, no cooper, couldn't I 
have done 
justice to Barclay and Perkins. A 
lady said to me, " Come ong do 
parte vouz, Mmseer I" I 
thought she said, " Come and have a 
quart 
of beer I" but never mind— 
You should see, &c. 
I 
danc'd with the ladies there, 
The money it flew by the load, 
Away went my profit on turnips and peas 
I'd made in the Whitechapel road. 
My sweetheart that I 
left behil,d 
In London. I 
now will reveal, 
She'd torn all their bonnets if she'd seen me dance 
With those belles IA the gay Mabille. 
Spoken— When T 
came back I 
taught my Sarah to dance the Can. 
can, and to sing with me— 
You should see, &c.

For you know how it is yourself.

The first time that we ever met, 
Was at Delmonico's. 
She thought that I 
had lots of cash, 
She judged me by my clothes.

That wasted all my wealth : 
I 
paid it though it sent me broke, 
For you know how it is yourself.

Quite free from thoughts of selt, 
Of course I

I WISH MY SALLY COULD. LeoNcLunED.1 
My Sally's an infamous jilt, to her I 
was going to be wed, 
But I 
wasn't-oh no, she went off, and married another instead, 
She called me a 
lumbering lout, and treated me just anyhow, 
I 
think that she'd alter her tune, if she could but look on me now. 
SPOKEN-Vine Veathers make vine birds- oh Sally, Sally, if 
thee wanted to marry a 
suit of clothes, why didn't thee tell I 
so ? 
I'd a 
come down and married thee drest like I 
am now, in a 
suit 
of clothes fit for a 
duke-but thee wentest off and married that 
skulemaster as ain't got money enow' to dress like this-but thee 
shalt see me, Sally-thee shalt see that Tony can look like a 
swell. 
I 
wish, oh, clang it-Chorus. 
Directly to Lunnon I 
got-I'd scarce jumped out o' the train, 
When I 
found the place to buy clothes is a 
street called Petticoat 
Lane. 
The tailors there were so polite, they suited me after a 
bit, 
And they every one of 'em said, these clothes were a 
beautiful fit. 
SPOKEN-They ought to know thee knows, l'd bought the 
clothes; they cost me over four pun ten and the hat in. 
I 
said to 
tailor chap, ain't this rather loose here ? 
Loose, said be, now 
s'elp me pon my vord-loose, no my boy, it's beautiful, worth 
double the moniesh, too. 
I 
said I 
ought to be taken in just here. 
Moses and Son, said lie, Moses and Son, ve've taken you in quite 
enough-it's beautiful-it's the fashion-and so it is. 
Sally, thee 
might'st ha' had me and coat and all-but I 
wish she were here 
to see, I-I'd rile her-oh, I 
wish-G7torusr. 
I 
know that all ways I'm a 
swell, for every one I 
meet, 
No matter if female or male, stops and stares at me in the streets, 
So Sally may go to the-well, it's no bit use to kick up a 
row, 
She'd be dying of envy if she could only just look on me now. 
SPOKEN—Eh, lads, thee doesn't often see yolks come out so 
extensive in Lunnun. 
It baint only the clothes, it be the figure as 
well-even the little poor boys in the street ha' bin a 
noticin. 
I 
'leered one say, Bill, d'ye see that blooming svell with the Grecian 
Bend on his shoulder? 
Yes, says the other ; vy, he's got the 
Roman Fall in von leg, and ram me into a 
rifle, if lie ain't got the 
Alexandria limp in his body. 
Yes, says a 
cabman, he's limp 
enough all over. 
I 
did feel proud, and began to sing-Citorizo

We all do love the pretty girls,

looked she winked at me, 
Oh! how is that for high ?

She's the prettiest lit tie charmer in all this town, 
And sweet sixteen so sly.

Her dress was in a

Looped up so gay and neat, 
And as bile went across the way, 
I 
saw her pretty feet. 
By chance she dropped her handkerchief, 
'Twas marked L- u- c-y. 
I 
picked it up, she thanked me then, 
Oh ! how is that for high ? 
And its, oh! my, &e. 
Of course this little chance T 
took,

She said her father he was rich, 
He lately had struck ile. 
As I 
exclaimed, " will you be mine?" 
Her sweetheart, he came by; 
Walk off, says he. 011, no says she. 
Oh! how is that for high ? 
And its, oh! my! etc.

Oh where can she have gone, she said she'd meet me here,

You send to me a

IRISH SONG AND DANCE.

I 
live beside the race track, where fast men and horses goes, 
My father is a 
stable man, my mother washes clothes,

hold their horses, too, 
I 
like to sing and dance, and that is what I'm going to do.

I'm going to show to you, 
That I'm the lad that's always glad, 
When I've dancing for to do. 
Before I 
walked I 
learned to dance, 'fore I 
could talk I'd sing, 
My father used to stop me, but again I'd soon begin, 
My mother said it was no use I 
never would keep still. 
I'd sing and dance at every chance; I 
guess I 
always will.

And now I'm going to try to stop, am, rest a

I COULDN'T STAY AWAY. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
As sung by LIZZIE LA GRANGE, of liOWO'S Circus. 
Way down in old Virginny, 
Where I 
was bred and born, 
That rosy, sunny country, 
I 
used to hoe the corn, 
In childhood's happy moments, 
My heart was light and gay, 
I've been to see my birth- place. 
For I 
couldn't stay away, 
CHORUS. 
For I 
couldn't, nor I 
wouldn't. 
I 
couldn't stay away from there, 
For I 
wouldn't ' cause I 
couldn't, 
Deed I

once did love a 
yellow- gal, 
Way down in Dixie's land, 
And I 
one day the question popp'd. 
To give me her heart and hand. 
Says she to me my heart's been won, 
And from me you must stay, 
But she was only joking, 
And I 
couldn't stay away.

DEW D'ANDIES. 
Words by 1V-2.1. fl. DELEHANTY. 
PriHide by T. BRIGHAM BISHOP. 
Now I'm going to tell you all a 
little story, 
But I 
promise you I'll not detain you long; 
It's about a 
darling, charming, little sweet one, 
She's the captivating subject of my song. 
But I'll tell you how we talked and how we flirted, 
When I 
met this belle: 
And ' twas then I 
called her little Dew D'Andies, 
For her name she would not tell. 
CHORUS. 
She's so sweet 
and so neat  
Oh I 
love the charming little Dew D'Andies, 
She's the sweetest girl that ever you did see, 
And she often sings me love among the roses. 
Now boys, she's just the girl for me. 
When I 
met her first ' twas out upon a 
pic-nic, 
And I 
shall never forget her winning smile, 
For she danced and made the changes in the music, 
With her graceful pretty fascinating 
Then I 
asked her for her name and her directions, 
For I'd like to call, 
Then she turned around and whispered Dew D'Andies, 
And she smiling said 'twas all. 
She's so sweet, & c. 
So, now listen to the sequel of my story, 
For as time rolled on we dearer friends became ; 
And though yet I 
call her little Dew D'Andies, 
I 
am sure she's got another pretty name. 
I 
have placed a 
ring upon her taper finger, 
So we're one, life for life; 
And Rosy -May my little Dew D'Andies, 
Is my darling, charming wife. 
COURTSHIP AND MARRIAGE. 
There's nothing in love but pain and distress, 
No matter how sweet its beginning, 
If either some rogue, or softheaded fool, 
A 
maiden's affection is winning. 
Observe how that fop, dress'd up in great sty/e, 
Is bowing in courtship to Nancy 1 
Of course she is pleased, and thinks to have caught, 
The very Adonis she'd fancy, 
Poor girl! couldst thou see with my searching eye. 
'Twould help you his faults to discover, 
But Cupid is blind, and therefore you chose, 
That dressed up machine for a 
lover. 
He offers his arm,—she gladly accepts,— 
How could she deny him the pleasure: 
He's such a 
nice man! refined and polite; 
Of all that is good he's a 
treasure ! 
Gallanting her home he talked of his wealth. 
And of his intention to marry, 
Walk in, Sir ! she said on reaching the door, 
And asked him a 
few moments to tarry, 
Yet' long was his stay, the hours quickly fled, 
While talking so sweet to each other; 
When lastly he said: "Allow me to ask, 
In marriage your hand from your mother I" 
Few months after that, I 
met them again, 
When both looled as sour as a 
lemon! 
The honeymoon's sky was darkened by clouds, 
In spite of her love and his mammon. 
Perhaps she found out that riches alone 
Will never afford us true pleasure; 
And that a 
fine man, made up by fine clothes, 
Not always will prove a 
great treasure. 
Be careful, dear girls, when making your choice-. 
Forget not 'tis losing or winning ! 
That you may not say "Love only brings pain, 
No matter how sweet its beginning l" 
SONG AND DANCE . 
As Sung by LIZZIE LA 
G RANGE, of Howe's Circus. 
One pleasant Stuntner's evening 
Some lady friends of mine 
Had given a 
moonlight pie-nic, 
And I 
was asked to join. 
The time and place was stated. 
And finally we met; 
How anxiously I 
waited, 
I 
never can forget. 
The time came round and tliete I 
found 
That all was bright as sunlight ; 
The ladies fair with flowing hair, 
Were dancing in the moonlight. 
CHORUS. 
Balance to your partners, then the music played, 
Alamand corners, all promenade, 
The sweet one then came to me 
With smiles as bright as sunlight, 
But soon we were both happy there, 
While dancing in the moonlight. 
But soon we left the dancers. 
And sought a 
shady nook, 
And while they danced the lancers, 
A private chat we took ; 
The music from a 
distance. 
Came wafted on the breeze. 
'Twas food for our loves cadence, 
And set our hearts at ease, 
- We spoke of love, the stars above 
That showered on us their bright light, 
In dusk and dew, I 
bent me low 
And kissed her in the moonlight. [ Balance, eze. 
The dancing now was over, 
And here and there was found, 
The gentle love and lover 
Conversing on the ground, 
But where was me and mine Own, 
Unnoticed by the test. 
In bliss until the unknown's 
Sweet head lay on my breast. 
She to my question answered yes, 
Which almost killed me outright, 
A memory bright of that sweet night, 
Comes dancing in the moonlight. 
Balance Sze. 
CLEMENTINA CAULTS. 
[Parody on the Mabel Waltz.] 
A sweet young girl that I 
know well, 
Cain Clementina Caults, 
Does so admire that lovely tune— 
They call the Mabel Waltz. 
Night and day she pines away, 
Her fancy never baits, 
Ask what you may, she's sure to say. 
I'll take the Mabel Waltz. 
La de dab, lah de dah, 
Sweet Miss Clemmy Caults, 
Night and day she pines away, 
For the awful Mabel Waltz. 
One day I 
took her out to dine, 
And thought to do the grand : 
Just as we began to eat, 
There canal a 
German band. 
Soon as they began to blow, 
jump'd Aliss Cleturny Cault 
Upsetting the table and the guests, 
She dane'd the Mabel Waltz. 
La de dah, ctc. 
Her head did ache, old Doctor Jake 
Prescribed some scented salts, 
But she rushed into a 
druggist's shop— 
For a 
bottle of Mabel Waltz. 
Should a 
policeman complain, 
And tell her of her faults, 
She'll seize him round the waist and make 
Him dance the Mabel Waltz. 
La de dab, drc. 
The Mabel Waltz, the Mabel Waltz, 
From morning, noon till night, 
She'd dance that tune until I 
thought, 
She'd drive me mad out right. 
If she ever dies, I 
think 
The ghost of Clenimy Cauits— 
Will pull me out of bed some night, 
To dance the Mabel Waltz. 
La de dah, &a.

PETER POTTS THE PEELER.— [CONCLUDED.] 
You'll often find me, when 'tis cold, 
A-standing down an area, 
All my brave deeds I 
then unfold, 
To Betsy, Jane, or Mary; 
I 
fancies as I

Right bang up to the letter, 
I'm most attentive to a 
cook, 
'Cos with them I 
fares better.—Cuoaus. 
I, by the cooks, could be well fed, 
But as I'm not a 
glutton. 
For a " snack," I 
eats a 
loaf of bread. 
And a 
couple o' pounds of mutton! 
My appetite's so worry queer, 
( 
You see that, without question) 
That about a 
couple o' pots o' beer 
I 
drink, to aid digestion.—Cnoaus. 
. 
A 
secret I 
to you will tell 
'Cos ' twill be in safe keeping, 
likes to find a 
drunken swell 
Upon a 
doorstep sleeping; 
I 
rushes up with staff in hand, 
And takes good care to floor him, 
Then swears as he's too drunk to stand,

DID YOU CALL ME ? 
Poetry and melody by Wm. H. D ELEHANTI. 
A 
GUILELESS child, a 
budrose, 
A 
mother's life and love, 
A 
father's joy and treasure, 
Angelic little dove, 
Dressed up so neat and pretty, 
With mother's pride and care, 
Blessed with a 
shower of kisses, 
Crowned with a 
mother's prayer ; 
God guide, shield and protect you, 
Direct you. 
through the day 
From evil, sin and danger, 
Kiss mother, now ; go play. 
CHORUS . 
From the window peeping, 
Baby's footsteps seeking, 
hark, our darling's speaking, 
Did you call me, mamma? 
A 
mother tired of watching, 
A 
baby tired of play, 
A 
father kind and loving, 
At home from toil of day ; 
The peaceful meal is over, 
While pa with babe cloth play, 
That dear, kind anoel mother, 
Prepares our child to pray ; 
God bless pa, ma at.d baby, 
Teach us which path to keep, 
And love us fondly, dearly, 
Kiss papa, now ; go sleep. 
From the window peeping, etc: 
Our pet, our bild, our cherub, 
Our bright swfset morning star, 
Our sunbeam and our dewdrop 
Is calling to mamma ; 
Has papa crone and left me, 
And never said good-bye, 
I 
did not feel him kiss me, 
Dear mamma, tell me why 7 
Yes, papa kiss'd and bless'd you, 
Before he went away, 
Thank God, sweet baby darling, 
You are f 
ut years old to day. 
From the window peeping, etc. 
LOVELY MARTHA MAY. 
Written and composed by Wm. H. DELEtterrrir. 
THE spring is here with flowers to cheer, 
The birds sing sweet to-day, 
The mead is green where she has been 
To while an hour away. 
That little child on whom she smiled, 
Or kissed in childish play, 
Is not her own; but that sweet one 
So loved Miss Martha May. 
CHORUS . 
Martha May, Martha mine, 
Sweet as flowers in May; 
The jesamine or eglantine 
Are not so bright and gay. 
If you but view the violet blue, 
Then you shall see her eyes; 
Or hear a 
band of music grand, 
Then you shall hear her voice; 
Or see a 
maid, though plain arrayed, 
Excel in beauty's grace; 
Or see two roses dipped in snow, 
Then you shall see her face. 
Martha May, Martha mine, etc. 
Beside the mill upon the hill, 
Where waters run alway, 
One afternoon in flowery June 
I 
chanced that way to stray; 
A 
maiden mild roamed with a 
child, 
And both were bent on play; 
The child said, " Martha, there's papa," 
Then ran to me straightway. 
Martha May, Martha ur in e 
etc. 
Into my arms, with sweet alarms, 
The little child did run -; 
A 
maiden fair was waiting there, 
But followed after soon. 
I 
kissed the baby, the!i the lady 
Said, 
Oh 
ain't you ashamed 7" 
The child said, " Martha, kiss papa." 
Now, who was to be blamed ? 
Martha May, Martha mine, etc.

He has servants, tradesmen, carriages, and animals beside, 
From thorough-breds to coach-horses, and hacks to take a

His darling ugly little dogs, his jewelry, his plate—

Who only once, when taken in his yacht beyond the Nore, 
Said that it made him vewy ill, and was a

horwid nasty bore, 
lie said it made him vewy ill, and was a

He has the very best cigars, but never takes a

He lights, and looks at them, and thinks that's quite enough; 
He seldom takes a

In short, the thing's inanimate, as if it had been slain ;

Cho.--Twas such a

And thus it matters little where he's led or what is done, 
If that his friends enjoy themselves, he thinks it's jolly fun; 
lie iris no judgment, can't reflect, appreciate or praise, 
lie was unfortunately born, and so must end his days, 
Without one wholesome thought of joy, past present, or in store, 
There's nothing in this lovely world, but what's a

FAIR ELLENORE. 
By W. H. 
DELEHANTY. 
Mv heart is light by day and night, 
With hope and love and joy in store, 
Since I 
have seen the lovely queen— 
The modest maiden, Ellenore. 
She's good and kind, and so refined, 
She has no fear the wide world o'er, 
Her sweetest smile is free of guile, 
A 
flower of love is Ellenore. 
CHORUS. 
Sweet Ellenore, fair Ellenore, 
Thou bast my heart forever more, 
'Tis full of love pure from above, 
For thee, for thee, fair Ellenore! 
The joys of spring, the birds that sing ! 
The woodbine twining round thy door, 
The sweet perfume of flowers in bloom 
Are loves of thee which I 
adore; 
I'll ne'er forget when last we met, 
The kindly tear your eye filled o'er ; 
And mine were blind by feeliuffs kind, 
The day we parted, Ellenore. 
Sweet Ellenore, etc. 
I 
hope and pray that come it may, 
The end of sorrow's weary chain, 
When I 
once more on native shore, 
May tread the dear paths o'er again ; 
And may it come across the foam, 
The sweet news touching my heart's core, 
That Blienore waits at the door, 
To meet me as in days befo:.e. 
Sweet Ellenore, etc 
LITTLE PRAIRIE FLOWER. 
By W. H. 
DELEHANTY. 
THERE'S a 
pretty little girl in town, 
With the sweetest, bright blue eyes, 
And a 
winning smile that's all the while 
Like sunshine in the skies ; 
She has a 
wicked, killing way—her own, 
To hold you in her power; 
Then with her eyes she'll tantalize— 
Entrancing you the more— 
Until you seem wrapt in a 
dream— 
This little Prairie Flower. 
CHORUS. 
She's the fairest of the fair, 
Sweetest of the sweet, 
Like a 
gem or jewel rare, 
Perfect and complete; 
But she was born out West, 
Where red men once held power; 
But she had come to girlhood's bloom, 
And sought an Eastern bower, 
That's how it came she bears the name 
Of little Prairie Flower. 
Now her parents they are fond of me, 
And welcome me with cheer, 
But one more sweet comes out to meet 
Me as I 
come a-near— 
With her pretty little outstretched hands, 
While, with loving words a 
shower, 
I 
never miss her modest kiss, 
Behind the cottage door ; 
I 
love her, yes, I 
must confess, 
This little Prairie Flower. 
She's the fairest, etc. 
Oh! if you could only bear her sing, 
Her soft, sweet, bird- like voice, 
The notes so clear would charm your ear, 
Your heart and soul rejoice; 
Oh! when you hear the village bells ring, 
As they never rang before— 
Remember this— the joy and bliss, 
That then shall be my dower, 
The pleasure's rile when 
my wife, 
My little Prairie Fio.k 
She's the faire t, etc. 
THE LILY OF THE VALLEY. 
Written and composed by Wm. H. DELEITANTY. 
W ILL you take a 
little ramble in the country, 
It's only just a 
little way from town, 
To an ivy-covered cottage in the valley, 
Where dwells a 
lovely maiden of renown; 
And she's the sweetest girl by far, 
That ever you did see, 
Among the other girls a 
star, 
She ever seems to be; 
And should you like to see this flow'r, 
Just take a 
walk with me, 
And from her little garden bower, 
I'm sure she'll smile on thee. 
CHORUS . 
She's the lily of the valley, 
And the girl I 
intend to marry, 
But come and take a 
ramble in the country, 
'Tis where the scent of roses fill the air, 
It's there you'll see the lily of the valley, 
All in her golden beauty, fresh and fair ! 
Oh, if you could only see her in the mornii 
It's when she goes for water to the spring, 
And see the lovely smile her face adorning, 
Or hear the pretty son°. I 
heard her sing ; 
You surely never could forget, 
And when in lonely hours— 
You'd think with joy of when you met 
My love among the flowers; 
Then, if you envy me my lot, 
You cannot be to blame; 
For it' some other won her heart, 
I 
know I'd feel the same. 
She's the lily, etc. 
Oh, lovely was the day when last I 
met her, 
And charming was the secret told to me, 
'Twas that she'd write me a 
letter, 
And place it in the hollow of a 
tree. 
That I 
should imitate her style 
She meekly did infer, 
While thro' her blush there came a 
smile— 
With—leave one there for her, 
The one you love the best in life— 
Make a 
messenger of me, 
I'll soon have power to call her wife, 
Then I 
will happy be. 
Shc'. lie lily, etc. 
MY LOVE IS LIKE A BIRD. 
MY 
love is like a 
bird, 
With plumage bright, and fair, 
Her voice -is like a 
chord 
Of music in the air; 
She's here and then she's there, 
She comes but will not stay, 
And when I 
think she's near, 
I 
find she's far away. 
CHORUS . 
First she'll please me, 
Then she'll tease me, 
Then she'll say some loving word, 
Singing, smiling—winning, wiling, 
Flitting here and there— 
My love is like a 
bird. 
All in the summer time 
When flowers are blooming gay, 
And merry birds do chime 
Their sweet notes all the day ; 
We wander through the dell, 
Or in the shady grove, 
And when my love I 
tell— 
She only laughs at love. 
First she'll please me, etc. 
My love is like a 
bird, 
For in the winter time 
Her voice is never heard 
About this chilly clime; 
But to a 
dearer spot 
She flies away to rest, 
Her home is in my heart, 
That's where she built her nest. 
First she'll please me, etc. 
THE SILVER SLIPPER. 
Song with Two Posture Dances, a 
Waltzing Chorus and Jig. 
Written by SAM'L N . 
M ITCHELL. 
Composed by H ENRI( TUCKER. 
The music of this song is published War. A . 
POND & CO, 547 Broadway, 
N. Y. Price 40 cents. 
THE moon was brightly shining, and a 
million little stars 
Sent down their rays upon her as I 
saw her through the bars; 
A 
merry crowd had gathered there and dancing was the feature, 
But the fairest flower in that bouquet was that charming little 
creature; 
She was dancing ' neath the arbor green, oh, she was just a 
clipper, 
And every time she tossed her foot she showed a 
silver slipper 
CHORUS . 
Oh, I 
can't forget the sweet and lovely pet, (Posture Dance.) 
The neatest ever seen, a 
perfect little queen, (
Posture Dance.) 
For underneath the arbor I 
watched that lively clipper, 
And now my thoughts are centred on her little silver slipper. 
(Dance.) 
Her hair was all in ringlets, and a 
wreath of roses fair 
Breathed out the sweetest fragrance on the calm midsummer air; 
A 
fascinating smile she had, her cheeks of ruby hue, 
And right above a 
Roman nose two eyes of violet blue; 
She was dancing neath the arbor green, oh, she was just a 
clipper, 
And every time she tossed her foot she showed a 
silver slipper. 
Oh, I 
can't forget, etc. 
I 
watched her all the evening, while my poor and wretched heart 
Was longing, vainly longing in that dance to take a 
part; 
The fates they were against me for a 
fence stood just between 
Me and that laughing jolly crowd that between the bars were 
seen ; 
She was (lancing ' neath the arbor green, oh, she was just a 
clipper, 
And every time she tossed her foot she showed a 
silver slipper. 
Oh, I 
can't for et . etc. 
I SNOW A MAID. 
By War. H . 
D FLEHANTY. 
I KNOW a 
maid who loves me, 
And holds my heart in keeping, 
For every day she proves me, 
her love to me is leaping, 
Like dews of summer weeping, 
In tears the bud rose steeping. 
CHORUS . 
Oh ! she's the darling of my heart, 
The sunshine of my eye, 
The love I 
feel can never part, 
Nor can it change or die. 
If you should chance to meet her, 
With grace and beauty charming, 
I'm sure you'd fondly greet her 
With admiration warming, 
With love your heart alarming, 
And wishes free of harming. 
! 
she's the darling, etc. 
Had'st thou but heard her talking, 
And the attention given, 
Or by her side been walking, 
That pleasant summer even, 
The air was flower-breath laden, 
And earth seemed part of heaven. 
Oh ! she's the darling,

good tune played on a

Is there any young man here will take me for his bride 1

Sung by DELEHANTY and HENGLEIs. 
Now darkies here we are assembled all, 
To please the ladies and gentlemen in this hall, 
Then flying from grief, we'll sing let its be gay, 
Awl send Dan Tucker supperless away, 
Not e'en invite hint in our minstrel tun. 
To wait till Jeanie gets her hoe-cake done, 
Then shake the Bones, and strike the Tambo, too, 
And show the white folks all what we can do. 
You may talk about the big sunflower, 
The gal that winked at me; 
But I 
declare none can compare 
With Matilda Strawberry. 
This Turtle-dove I 
dearly love, 
To me I 
know she's true ; 
She's six feet tall, her feet are small, 
She wears a 
sixteen shoe. 
CHORUS. 
Salute your partners, down the middle, 
Take this darkie's hand ; 
Sound the banjo, hear the fiddle, 
She's the prettiest in de land. 
She's pretty and she's learned, too, 
She's been to hoarding school ; 
She's handsome as an elephant, 
And graceful as a 
mule. 
When we walk out, we're talked about, 
We are the belle and beau; 
Oh. I 
look neat, and she looks sweet 
In yellow calico. 
Salute your partners, &c. 
I'm happy as the day is long, 
For she is all my own ; 
I'm going to cork my charmer up, 
And sell her for cologne. 
Her eves are bright, she's my delight, 
She's happy, gay and free; 
Oh, it is true. what I 
tell you 
Of Matilda Strawberry. 
Salute your partners, &c. 
SONG OF JOKES. 
As I 
walked thro' the town one pleasant night in spring, 
I 
stood 'neath the windows to hear the girls sing ; 
Oh where and oh where, has my highland laddie gone, 
He's gone, he's gone, as meek as any lamb, 
They took him, yes, they took him to the arms of Abraham; 
Away, away, away down south in Dixie, 
Where the troops are the finest I 
ever did see, 
And the captain with his whiskers, took a 
sly glance at 
Johnny Sehmoker, Johnny Sehmoker, 
Oh I 
heard the drum beat and the music so sweet, 
But my eyes at the time caught a 
much better treat, 
For gay and happy, gay and happy, 
We'll be gay and happy still, 
Glory, glory, halleujah, as we go marching on 
Oh Sallie come up, 
Sallie come dOwn, Sallie come down to 
Maryland, my Maryland, Maryland, my Maryland, 
For hast thou no feeling to see me kneeling with 
No one to love, none to caress, 
Roaming along thro' this world's wilderness, 
Oh how can I 
leave thee, how can I 
break apart, 
When sheepskin and beeswax make an awful plaster, 
The more you try to take it oft, 
A few days, a 
few days, 
What's the use of sighing, I'm going home, 
To the land of the tree and home of the girl I 
left behind me, 
The girl I 
left behind me. 
Kind friends, your pity, pray, bestow 
On one who stands before you, 
And listen to my tale of woe, 
Though I 
promise not to bore you. 
I 
longed to be a 
soldier's bride, 
In my heart there burnt ambition's flame; 
For I 
loved a 
gay young Colonel, who 
From Constantinople came. 
Constantinople, Constantinople, 
Constantinople, the Colonel came. 
CHORUS. 
C-o-n

Con, s- t-a-n

With a 
Con-stan, t-i with a 
Con-stanti, 
No no with a

Con-stan-ti.no, 
P-1-e 
with a 
pull, Constantinople. 
I 
met the Colonel at a 
ball, 
To him I 
was presentee; 
Upon his knees the youth did fall, 
And lots of stuff invented: 
He said he was a 
Turkish Prince, 
And begged that I 
would bear his name; 
So, I 
accepted the young Colonel, who 
From Constantinople came. 
C-o-n

One evening, while we sat at tea, 
We'd a 
visit most informal: 
The Police came, and, gracious me! 
They took away the ColoneL 
I 
soon found he a 
swindler was, 
And long had carried on that game; 
And thus I 
lost my Colonel, who 
From Constantinople came.

MARTHA JANE BERWE. 
My song is of a 
darling little, cunning little, 
Captivating, fascinating creature, 
And she has a 
pretty name, 
Arid where 1 
met this little brunette, 
I 
know I 
never shall forget. 
I 
see her yet, my little pet, 
My own dear Martha Jane. 
Martha Jane Berwe, she is beautiful to view, 
Her hair is dark, her lovely face adorning. 
Now fellows all beware, or your hearts she will ensnare, 
And don't forget I 
give you all a 
warning. 
One summer's afternoon, when the flowers were in bloom, 
I 
saw this lovely charmer. She was walking all alone 
'Twas in the Park, where Cupid's dart, 
Then made a 
capture of my heart, 
I 
felt that I 
had fell in love 
With Martha Jane Berwe. 
Martha Jane Berwe, &c. 
This dashing belle is beautiful, she's amiable and suitable 
She is just my style, and all the while 
To me a 
perfect charm. 
On love was bent to her I 
went, 
To ask her if she would consent, 
And not prevent my good intent, 
But kindly take my arm. 
Martha Jane Berwe, etc. 
And how I 
did rejoice, -when I 
heard her gentle voice, 
And saw her bright eyes sparkle, on her lips a 
rosy hue. 
1 
called her then my turtle dove, 
My little angel from above, 
My rose, my hope, my joy, my love, 
My Martha Jane Berwe. 
Martha Jane Berwe, j5c-
On Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, 
Friday, Saturday, then on Sunday, 
Every evening in the week, I 
visit Martha Jane. 
And you must know, a 
week ago, 
I 
popped the question to my beaux, 
She said dear Joe, I 
can't say no, 
I 
want to change my name. 
Martha Jane Berwe, d/c. 
The time is drawing near, when I'll wed my little dear, 
A matrimonial meeting, you shall hear of very soon. 
So now I'm anxious for the time, 
When I 
can call Miss Martha mine, 
So now and then for ever thine,

Oh, don't I

Her name is Nelly Darning Cotton, 
Oh, don't she look so gorgeous. 
When all her Sunday best she's got on. 
Nelly wears a 
lovely dress, 
With follerrolls around the bottom, 
The first time I 
saw Nelly, 
By Cupid I 
was struck. 
Oh, my, she keeps a 
little candy shop, 
Oh, dear, I 
reckon I'm in luck, 
My eyes! she's sweeter than a 
sugar plum, 
I'm so fond of Nelly, for she's such a 
little duck. 
When first I 
met Miss Darning Cotton, 
1 
in Broadway was stalking, 
Looking at the bonnet shops. 
I 
saw my pretty Nelly walking. 
I 
smiled at her, she smiled at ins, 
Then we began a 
talking, 
She was so fascinating, 
Quite stupid I 
was struck. 
Oh, my, she keeps, & c. 
She is so fair I 
do declare 
My love for her I 
could not smother, 
I 
told her so awl then she said, 
She'd introduce me to her mother. 
How I 
jumped for joy. 
When she said she didn't love another, 
I 
thought I 
should have fainted, 
She was such a 
little duck.

I'm Corporal White, of the Black Brigade, 
I'm always ready for dress parade, 
The boys of me are getting afraid, 
Since I've been in the army. 
I 
teach the wenches how to sing, 
And some to dance the Highland Fling— 
I 
often cut the pigeon wing, 
For I 
am the pet of the army. 
Spoken—Yes, you ought to see me every Sunday afternoon 
when I 
get my new uniform on ; then I 
hear the colored ladies 
say : " who is dat gentleman ?" some one will answer, that's 
Corporal Wh'te of the Black Brigade, 
Always ready for dress parade, 
The boys of me are getting afraid, 
Since I've been in the army. 
I 
left the old massa in '61, 
And joined the soldier, at Bull Run, 
And then skedaddled to Washington, 
Along with the rest of the army. 
When I 
left home ray mammy did cry, 
But then I 
think : t

The old man said I 
was a

For joinirg the Yankee Army.

was the first

was the first

fickle damsel, 
And I 
thought that she loved me; 
But soon I 
found that it was folly, 
For both of us could not agree. 
The way I 
lost her, now ill tell you, 
How I 
came to lose her hand ; 
I 
took her to see a 
minstrel concert, 
And she tell in love with one of the band. 
CHORUS. 
If she loved me I'd be happy, 
She might have been a 
lady grand ; 
But, she better loved the big bass singer, 
Who sat in the middle of a 
Minstrel Band. 
He'd give her tickets for the concert, 
And she'd 
it in the front row ; 
And in a 
hurry then he'd " wash up," 
And hasten out, then home they'd go. 
He'd sing the ' Old Sexton" for to please her, 
And at the low notes she would stare ; 
While I 
distracted on the sidewalk, 
Raved and swore and tore my hair. 
If she loved me, &c. 
So back my pictures then she gave me, 
And told me ne'er to show my face; 
Or dare to think that I 
could win her, 
Until I 
learned to warble bass. 
I 
left her and in the " Clipper" lately 
1 
read that she was shuffling sand ; 
And travelling as a 
lady cloggist, 
With a 
Female Minstrel Band.

To keep honest fellows afive; 
So, I

I'm an excellent hand at a

It's true that I

And yet I 
have riches most rare, 
Being happy, contented and healthy 
And not overweighted with care; 
My heart is as light as a 
feather, 
I 
find it an excellent plan 
To chirrup in all sorts of weather : 
I'm such a 
convivial man ! 
Then, ha, ha, ha! &c. 
I'm asked out to every dinner, 
Invited to parties and balls : 
There's no fear of my getting thinner, 
Whilst favoured with these kind of calls; 
At a 
picnic, a 
wedding or christening, 
They will have me there, if they can : 
And no one receives such a 
greeting, 
I'm such a

Oh ! believe me, it's better than money,

Because she has more gold than I.

In time of need, she'll be as poor as I.

But nothing to my mother said.

Oh! mother, mothlr! you do not know 
What grief and pain, and sorrow, woe— 
Go get a

And a

On every line she dropped a

While calling home her Willie dear 
And when her father he ckame home, 
He said 
Where is my daughter gone ? 
He went up stairs— the door he broke— 
He found her hanging upon a

He took his knife and he cut her down, 
And in her breast these lines were found:

beautiful boy." 
" 
To make him a 
beauty," cried out Mrs. Sneer, 
" 
We'll be troubled unless the child has a 
tweet leer." 
Then to give me this leer Mrs. Glazier arose, 
And a 
piece of red putty stuck bang on my nose. 
This made me to wink and to blink so, 
The ladies knew not what to think, oh, 
And at last it turned into a 
squint, oh, 
Which made me a 
beautiful boy. 
To make me accomplished, I 
wanted one thing, 
My mouth was too small for the dear child to sing, 
Then to stretch it and spread it they all of them tried, 
Till they stretched my sweet mouth nearly half a 
yard wide 
Crying: " Pull away now, Mrs. Rider, 
It must be a 
little bit wider." 
My dear mouth they split pretty high, sir, 
All to make me a 
beautiful boy, 
Now, being complete, I 
was next sent to school, 
And to show off my make, was stuck on a 
high stool, 
When the children went home, they cried out with surprise: 
We have a 
new boy at school with such beautiful eyes! 
He can look any way so handy, 
Such a 
mouth he has got to suck candy! 
And his legs are so preciously bandy, 
They call him the beautiful boy."- 
T'other day I 
was asked in the city to dine, 
'The ladies, in raptures, all thought me divine; 
And all, when observing my elegant grace, 
Neglected their dinner to look at my face. 
They cried: " I 
shall faint with surprime I 
No gas-lights can equal his eyes, 
And such a 
month for mince-pies! 
Law! ain't he a 
beautiful boy?" 
Now, ladies, beware of Love's powerful darts, 
For fearful I 
am I 
shall steal all your hearts, 
And then, you dear, sweet little creatures, you'll sigh, 
And doat on my charms till you languish and the. 
For, you know, I 
can't marry you all, 
Yet, believe me, whenever you call, 
My endeavors will be to please all, 
Although such a 
beautiful boy.

BASE BALL JOE. 
DARK AND ROGUISTI 
I 
from Cincinnati came, 
I'm an undergraduate; 
lip you know to every gamo, 
Wide awake rbeg to state; 
Fashion's king, Queen City's pet, 
With the Red Stockings I 
go, 
Though my name is Joseph, yet, 
I'm known as Base Ball Joe. 
Base Ball Joe, Base Ban Joe, 
Yes, I'm known as Base Ball Joe, 
Base Ball Joe, Base Ball Joe, 
Yes, I'm known as Base Ball Joe: 
See me in file ball field 
Tho' opponents seem to win; 
Bat in hand I 
bide my time, 
Wait till Base Ball Joe goes in; 
Wows the time I 
lift my bat, 
Be the pitching swift or slow, 
Run and run again—foul ball, 
That's the style for Base Ball Joe, 
Base Ball Joe, &c. 
Surprise all other clubs by storm, 
Altho' sometimes it is a 
race, 
And in making a 
home run, 
Joseph always goes the pace; 
Mind you give a 
friendly call, 
If out west you chance to go, 
Always glad to see you all, 
.Please to ask for Base Ball Joe. 
Base Ball Joe, (tc 
We all do like the pretty girls, 
We see them day by day, 
And holm at first sight fall in love, 
When e'er they pass that way, 
But a 
charming girl, the other morn, 
I 
saw come walking by, 
And, as she gazed, I 
saw she had 
A dark and roguish eye. 
CHORUS. 
I 
never can forget her, 
The first time that I 
met her, 
And, as I 
looked, my fate was booked, 
I 
sealed it with a 
sigh: 
I 
found that I 
had fell in love 
With a 
dark and roguish eye. 
Her dress was in the fashion cut, 
looped up so gay and neat, 
And as she went to cross the way, 
I 
saw her pretty feet, 
By chance she dropped her handkerchief, 
'Twas marked L-u-c-y; 
I 
picked it up, she thanked me with 
A 
dark and roguish eye. 
I 
never can forget her, to 
Of course, this little chance I 
took, 
We walked and talked awhile, 
She said her father he was rich, 
He lately had struck lie. 
But as I 
exclaimed: Will you be mine? 
Her fellow he came by; 
Walk off! he said, or I'll give you 
A dark and roguish eye!

THE GAL THAT TOOK MY EYE. 
Song and Dance, written by JERRY 
COHAN, for BILLY AsHcROFT. 
As I 
was walking down the street the other afternoon, 
Pulled on my kids, lit my sheroot, in front of a 
saloon, 
When a 
vision floated past my sight which caused the dust to 
fly, 
Twas the prettest girl I 
ever saw, the gal that took my eye. 
CHORUS. 
She was so fair, I 
do declare [Dance. 
I 
feel so queer, when I 
am near, 
The gal that took my eye. 
I 
watched her as she crossed the street, my heart was all aflame; 
I 
quickly waved my handkerchief, of course she done the same. 
In a 
moment I 
was at her side: " Your pardon, Miss, said I. 
If I 
am bold, pray tell me so, but then you took my eye." 
Chorus and Dance. 
I 
asked her if she would be mine, when we stood at her door ; 
She said she'd no objection, but her parents they were poor. 
But I 
dent mind such trifles for to win her I 
shall try, 
And if I 
do I'll show to you the gal what took my eye. 
She was so fair, iitc. 
ENCORE VERSE. 
Her father is an artist, that is, in the white wash line. 
Her mother keeps an oyster stand, her fruit is very fine; 
The gal is in a 
restaurant, nice doughnuts she does fry, 
And every night when we walk out them doughnuts take my 
eye.

WHERE THE WOODBINE TWINETH. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Poetry by W. H. DELEHANTY. Melody by Mrs. W. H. DELEHANTY. 
Published by White, Smith & Perry. 298 & 300 Washington St, Boston 
Price 35 cents. 
It was where tivrt woodbine twineth, behind a 
floral screen, 
In a 
graceful pose reclineth, a 
maid of sweet sixteen. 
Sc enchanting was the picture, I 
could not pass it by, 
• 
But I 
stood as if it statue, for beauty charms the eye; 
Then I 
saw that she was reading, to while away the time, 
And my anxious gaze unheeding, beneath the woodbine vine. 
CHORUS. 
But I 
love her so, as you all may know, 
This pretty little creature on the portico. 
It was there we met, I 
will ue'er forget, 
Down where the woodbine twineth. [Dance. 
There I 
stood like one bewilder'd. what course could I 
pursue, 
With her loveliness enraptured, I 
knew not what to do, 
As a 
balmy breeze then wafted, her fan tell on the ground, 
While in ecstacy I 
grasp'd it, fair maid, your fan I've found. 
Teen she smiled and thanked me kindly, with blushes like 
carmine, 
And she sweetly said she'd meet me, beneath the woodbine 
vine. 
But I 
love her so, & c. 
The appointed time for meeting, was Sunday night at eight, 
And what happened on that evening, to you I 
will relate; 
Now her Pa and Ma were absent, and she was left alone, 
As her parents gave their consent that she might stay at 
So shbe
orn
pleay
;, ed the grand piano, I 
sang and danced in time, 
And we sat on the veranda, beneath the woodbine vine. 
But I 
love her so, &c. 
There we met, we loved, we parted, my heart with joy cloth 
For to me she breathed a 
secret, with darling don't you tell, 
But I 
soon became acquainted with her Papa and Ma, 
She's in ev'ry vision painted, my love, my Luiding star. 
NtiW my story's almos , ended. I've married Caroline, 
And we live where once we flirted, beneath the woodbine vine 
Bit , I 
love her so, & c. 
• 
My heart it am so full of love, 
I 
don't know what to do, 
Since first I 
met that pretty girl, 
That I 
saw dressed in blue; 
I 
was walking out one evening, 
My heart did palpitate, 
knd passing by the house, I 
saw, 
Her standing at the gate. 
CHORUS. 
She's the sweetest ever seen, 
And dressed just like a 
queen 
Her hair it hung in ringlets, 
And then such lovely eyes 
If ever I 
should marry her, 
You bet, I'd get a 
prize. 
I 
went around to the house next evening, 
Dressed in my clothes of best, 
With patent- leather high-heeled bouts, 
A 
nice silk hat and vest ; 
We walked and talked together, 
Until it was quite late, 
And bidding her a 
sweet good night, 
I 
left her at the gate. 
And now that we are to he married, 
And oh what happy times, 
An invitation I'll send all, 
To stop with us and (line ; 
But now I'll bid you all good night, 
I've no time to wait, 
I'm to go around the corner for 
To meet Ina at the gate.

JOCKEY HAT AND FEATREE. 
As I 
was walking out one day, 
Thinking of the weather, 
I 
saw a 
pair of roguish eyes, 
'Neath a 
hat and feather; 
She looked at me, I 
looked at her, 
It made my heart pit-pat, 
Then turning round she said to nis, 
"How do you like my hat?" 
CHORUS. 
Oh I 
I 
said its gay and pretty, tot, 
They look well together, 
Those glossy curls and jockey hat, 
With a 
rcoster's feather. 
She wore a 
handsome broadcloth basque, 
Cut the latest fashion, 
And flounces all around her dregs, 
Made her look quite dashing; 
Her high-h, 
eled boots as she walked on 
The pavement went pit-pat, 
ne'er forget the smile I 
saw, 
Beneath that jock ,y 
Fat. 
Oh ! I 
slid its gay, ac, 
She kissed her band and said " Au revoir," 
Then I 
was a 
goner, 
Before I'd tine to say " Good-bye," 
She was round the corner. 
I 
tried that night, but could not sleep, 
So up in bed I 
sat, 
And right b.fore my face I 
thought 
I 
saw that jockey bat.

ON SUNDAY EVE AT EIGHT. 
Song and dan3e by BOBBY NEWCOMB. 
Words by FRANK DUMONT. 
Music by ROLLIN HOWARD. 
The sweetest one in all the world, 
I 
chanced one day to meet; 
My heart went with this little " Belle," 
The Queen of Chestnut street. 
A dainty glove by chance she dropp'd, 
It seemed all done by fate; 
I 
pick'd it up, " meet me," she said, 
On Sunday eve at eight, 
CHORUS. 
Oh 1 
how my heart did palpitate, 
As I 
lingered near the gate, 
She's the fairest one in all the town, 
Some day she'll be my bride, 
I 
never can forget the day, 
I 
first walked by her side. 
Then Sunday evening came and I 
On the corner did wait; 
Where soon she met me and we walk'd, 
Thro' the park until quite late. 
We whisper'd words so low and sweet, 
For she's toy darling " Kate ;" 
We said good night to meet again, 
On Sunday eve at eight. 
Oh! how, arc. 
At a 
ball we went and by my side, 
Was my dariing fond and true; 
We danced and spoke of the future bright, 
She said, " I 
love but you." 
I 
asked her to become my bride, 
As I 
lingered near the gate ; 
She whispered, " Yes, when will it be 2" 
" 
Nest Sunday eve at eight." 
BLUE EYED ROSA. 
Serenade. 
A 
blonde I 
met the other day, 
With long and flowing hair; 
Bat who she is I 
cannot say, 
But I 
meet her everywhere. 
She's got a 
corner of my heart, 
I 
see her in my dreams; 
She's too angelic to be mortal, 
A 
spirit to me she seems. 
CHORUS. 
They call her blue eyed Rosa, 
Her name I'll ne'er forget; 
Her blush is like a 
rose in May, 
try and win her yet. 
She similes at me when we do meet, 
On every thorout.hfare, 
Those sweet blue eyes of Rosa dear, 
Do haunt me everywhere. 
I 
met her the other afternoon, 
Out for a 
promenade; 
I 
stopped and introduced myself, 
And pretty things I 
said. 
She said I 
might escort her home, 
It made me feel so queer; 
I 
shall never forget the day I 
met, 
My pretty Rosa dear. 
I 
walked along with Rosa dear, 
The time did quickly pass; 
I 
asked her if she would be mine, 
Her mamma she would ask; 
I 
waited for my answer, 
The words my heart did cheer; 
For now I'm married and settled down, 
Along with Rosa dear, 
They call her, &c.

THE SWEETEST OF THE SWEET. 
Words by ilAtutY BLOODGOOD. 
Music by A. H. FBRIVALD. 
As I 
walked out one morning, 
The sun was shining bright, 
And for a 
tune I 
felt my eyes 
Were dazzled by its light. 
When just as I 
was going 
To step across the street. 
I 
met a 
charming creature, 
The sweetest of the sweet. 
CHORUS. 
Oh her eyes were bright, 
Her step was light, 
I 
know right well that little belle, 
Is the sweetest of the sweet; 
I 
know right well that little belle, 
Is the sweetest of the sweet. 
I 
said, Oh , charming creature, 
Will you accept my arm ; 
I'll see you safe across the street. 
She looked up in alarm; 
Young man, she said, and then she smiled. 
Oh, for, ' twas such a 
treat, 
ne'er forget the look she gave, 
'Twas sweetest of the sweet. 
Oh her, &c. 
Ere many weeks had passed away, 
I 
took her for my bride, 
And now she is my only joy, 
My beauty and my pride. 
And as I 
walk with her along 
The busy crowded street, 
I 
feel my wife most surely is 
'the sweetest of the sweet. 
Oh her, Sze.

GAMBLERS. 
Pete.—" I 
had a 
dream last night. 
Steve.— What did you dream ?" 
dream't we were both playing cards. 
Clubs 
were trumps ; you begged, and I 
gave " you one," ( pre-
tends to strike him.) 
Steve.—" Hold on, I 
never play cards 
Pete.—" Yes, you do ; we all play cards." 
Steve.—' , How do you make that out?' 
Pete.—" Our life is but a 
game of cards, 
Which each one has to learn ; 
Each shuffles, cuts and deals his cards, 
And each his trump cloth turn. 
Some turn a 
high card to the top, 
While others turn a 
low; 
Some hold a 
hand quite flush of trumps, 
When others none can how. 
When hearts are trumps 
We 
play for love, and pleasure decks the hour; 
No thought of sorrow checks our joys, 
In friendship's rosy bower. 
For when the heart is on the top, 
We our cards at random play; 
But when the heart is in the hand, 
Our life is but a 
holiday. 
When diamonds chance to crown the pack. 
'Tis then men stake their gold; 
Large sums are often lost and won, 
By gamblers, young and old. 
Each watches his neighbor. 
in chance to catch him cheat upon the sly; 
It is then when men become the dupes of rogues, 
And rogues each other cheat. 
And he is indeed a 
wise man, 
Who never meets defeat. 
"When clubs are trumps look out for war, 
On ocean and on land; 
For horrid deeds are often done, 
When clubs are in the hand. 
The last game of all is when the spade 
Is turned by the hand of Time ; 
'Tis he that finishes up the game, 
in every land and clime. 
No matter how much each may win, 
Or how much each may save; 
You'll find the spades turn up at last, 
And digs the player's grave. 
Ana so you see, Steve, we all play cards,"

BROWN THE TRAGEDIAN.—.[CoNcLuDED.1 
You have all seen my name in the bills, 
Which is Junius Antonius Brown, sirs; 
And I 
flatter myself I 
have caused 
Great excitement in many a 
town, sirs; 
My last " shop" was the Garrick, Whitechapel; 
In a " part" that I 
could above any fit, 
My " screw," sirs, for only six nights 
Was two pounds and half a 
clear benefit. 
Spoken—That was money, but what do they offer talent now? 
I 
was actually offered the other day twenty-five " bob" per week 
to play Othello, the Clown in the Pantomime, and do bill-sticking 
in the morning. 
Did I 
accept it ? 
Blood and blue fire! 
Never! 
never! 
But no matter, a 
time may come when they will be glad 
to secure the services of Brown the tragedian.—Cnoans. 
Since Kemble none like me's been seen, 
Yet nought but bad luck is my portion; 
My friends say I'm better than Kean, 
That my " Richard" and " Hamlet" 's 
a 
caution. 
They say my declaiming's a 
treat 
In the speech over Caesar by Antony; 
I 
can do the soft parts low and sweet, 
Likewise I 
can " pile up the agony." 
Spoken—For two consecutive weeks was I 
the leading attrac-
tion at the Royal Bower, and should have startled the world at 
Drury Lane, but for professional malice. I 
am kept off the boards 
out of fear. They know I 
should render Shakespeare's great char-
acters as they have never been rendered before. 
My reading of 
his plays is entirely different to Macready, Kean, Phelps, T. C. 
King, and all these fellows. 
They know that; but no matter, a 
time may come when they will cringe to Brown the tragedian.— 
Ciionus. 
I 
search through the " Era" each week, 
And I " write in" when talent's required, 
But they say they don't know me (there's cheek, 
Of such insults and envy I'm tired); 
They offer me terms for a " super," 
Or ask if I'm up to " utility," 
But I'll starve and remain as I 
am, 
An artiste of wondrous ability. 
Spoken—Me, me! Junius Antonius Brown descend to do the 
cock in Hamlet, or Bobby in the Pantomime. Ye Gods and small 
fishes! 
Rather would I descend from my pedestal of fame and 
become a 
comic vocalist. 
But no matter! no matter! 
The time 
may come when they will be glad to pile gold at the feet of Brown 
the tragedian.—CnORITS.

HET 
TY CLOVER. 
SONG AND DANCE . 
'Trs of a 
girl I'm going to sing, 
And her fortunes to relate, 
Reconstructed she has been 
. From old Carolina State; 
Her eyes were bright, her teeth were white, 
But her feet they spread all over, 
If you wish to learn her cognomen, 
'Tis pretty Hetty Clover. 
CHORUS . 
Hetty (Symph.) Hetty, (Symph.) 
You may search this world all over, 
You'll never find so sweet a 
girl 
As pretty Ifetty Clover. 
I 
asked Miss Tietty for her hand, 
When she began to sigh, 
Your refusal, Hefty-, dear, 
Will cause me for to die. 
She threw her arms around my neck, 
And kissed my face all over. 
She said, you're mine through life or death, 
My own devoted lover. 
Hetty, (Symph.) etc. 
In a 
little while we were wed, 
I 
had a 
small amount of cash, 
A dandy fig he came along 
With a 
big moustache; 
My Hetty fell in love with him, 
My happiness was over, 
He came one night and did elope 
With my false 'Jetty Clover. 
CHORUS . 
Hefty, (
Symph.) lietty (Symph.) 
You may search this world all over 
You'll never find so false a 
girl 
As ugly Hetty Clover.

THAT'S THE KIND OF A GAWK I AM. 
Written and Composed by Wm. II. 
D ELEHANTY. 
OH! my name is Timothy Harmless, 
From a 
land that's wide and wild, 
I'm a 
regular mule in harness, 
And a 
wild- cat when I'm riled ; 
Yes, a 
Buffalo Bill, by jingo! 
All the way from Huberdam, 
But I 
ain't much on the lingo, 
That's the kind of a 
gawk I 
am. 
CHORUS. 
But how is this for harmless, 
While I 
sling my harness, 
Yes I'm from the rural district, 
I'm a 
Cincinnati ham, 
And I 
came to see the Elephant, 
That's the kind of a 
gawk I 
am. 
I'm a 
jayhawk from the country, 
As you all can plainly see, 
Tho' I 
ain't no Mace-O'Baldwin, 
Nor a 
Heenan-Morrisey; 
While I 
don't use knife or pistol, 
And l'm happy as a 
clam, 
I 
can make an eye look crystal, 
That's the kind of a 
gawk I 
am. 
But how is this, etc. 
While I 
walked down the street to-day, 
Rigged up in awful style, 
I 
met a 
gal primped up so gay— 
And couldn't help but smile; 
We went into a 
restaurant, 
Had oysters, gin and jam, 
I 
let her put up every cent, 
That's the kind of a 
gawk I 
am. 
But how is this, etc.

MAUD DE MOORE. 
Written by Wm. H. D KLEHANTY. 
My heart is light by day or night, 
With hope and love and joy in store, 
Since I 
have seen the lovely queen— 
The modest maiden Maud De Moore. 
And when you see her you'll agree— 
She has no peer the wide world o'er, 
Her sweetest smile knows naught of guile, 
" 
A 
flower of love" is Maud De Moore. 
CHORUS. 
Thou hest my heart wherc'er thou art, 
Sweet Maud I 
cannot offer more, 
'Tis full of love pure from above, 
Deal kindly with it Maud De Moore, 
The joys of spring the birds that sing, 
The ivy twining round thy door, 
The sweet p3rfume of flowers in bloom, 
Are loves of the which I 
adore; 
When last we met can I 
forget, 
The kindly tear your eye filled o'er, 
And I 
was blind with feelings kind— 
But sad to part with Maud de Moore. 
Thou host my heart, etc. 
I 
hope and pray, that come it may, 
The end of sorrow's weary chain, 
When I 
once more my native shore, 
May tread its dear paths o'er again, 
And may it come across the foam, 
The joy that reaches my heart's core, 
To know you'll meet me at the gate, 
As loving as in days of yore. 
Thou hast my heart, etc. 
ROGUISH EIVIALINE. 
Written by Wm. H. D ELEECANTY. 
I'm happy as the birds in Spring- time, 
That warble in the air, 
While they hop about from limb to limb, 
For the troubles of the world they little care. 
So that's the very way l'm feeling, 
The reason I 
will tell, 
I'm in love as you can plainly see, 
With a 
captivating roguish little belle. 
CHORUS. 
We first met in the Summer, 
Down by a 
running stream, 
And upon my sacred honor, 
It seems to be a 
dream. 
But I 
love her as you may suppose, 
She's one of sweet sixteen, 
And as pretty as the red, red rose, 
Is the roguish little beauty, Emaline. 
Now of all the pretty girls I 
know of, 
There's none so sweet and fair, 
For her eyes are like a 
bright sun-beam, 
And a 
light brown is the color of her hair. 
I 
received a 
billet-doux this morning 
From one in love, I 
ween, 
Which has made me happy all day long, 
'Twas from the little beauty, Emaline! 
We first met, etc. 
In her note she said she wished to see me, 
If the weather it be fine, 
So, this night I'm going to meet my love, 
As I 
live in hopes to make this beauty mine. 
She's the darling of my heart, and dearer 
Than all on earth beside, 
And my happiness will be complete, 
When I 
take this little beauty for my bride. 
We first met, etc. 
A COLORED CAMP MEETING SONG. 
Written by Wm. H. DELEHANTY and sung by DELEHANTY and HENGLER. 
I 
TOOK a 
stroll one afternoon, 
Sweet chil hen hear dis tale, 
'Twas in the latter part of June, 
Children, mark dis tale. 
I 
sat me down beside a 
stream, 
Children, hear me thro', 
I 
somehow seemed to sleep and dream, 
That dream I'll tell to you. 
CHORUS. 
Sing low, sweet children, 
The angels soon will come, 
Sing low, sweet children— 
They're coming to take me home. 
This an angel said to me, 
We're coming to take you home, 
Where all are happy, all are free— 
Coming to take you home, 
A 
golden chariot then came down, 
Children, mark dis tale, 
.t.nd dere was angels white and browf:, 
Sinners, mark dis tale. 
Sing low, etc. 
Angels twined about my hair 
Flowers wet with dew, 
A wreath of roses fresh and fair, 
Sweet children hear me thro'. 
Soon they robed me all in white, 
Oh ! the blessed Lamb. 
They set me in the chariot bright, 
Beside the blessed Lamb. 
Sing low, etc, 
Then I 
woke up from my dream, 
Den I 
hove a 
sigh, 
There I 
was beside the stream, 
And tears was in my eye; 
I 
took it for a 
warning sent, 
So I'm prepared to die. 
Don't grieve for me, I'm well content, 
And I'm prepared to die. 
Sing low, etc. 
Written and Composed by Wm. II DELEHANTY. 
OW I know a 
little maiden, 
By the name of " Bossy Doon," 
And by invitation I 
am going to call; 
And my heart with love is laden, 
Since we met this afternoon, 
When she blushed and said she loved me best of all 
And she looked just as charming— 
As the flowers in May, 
Or a 
peach ripe, ready for to fall. 
Oh ! I 
couldn't see the harm in— 
Giving her my heart to- day, 
For I 
really thipk she's the sweetest of them all. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! tell me why—you wink your eye, 
You roguish little butterfly, 
Or do you know on whom l'm going to call. 
While merrily on every tree 
The little birdies sing to me— 
Bessie is the sweetest girl of all. 
Now I 
was one of them who thought 
That love was all a 
myth, 
And I 
never gave it any heed at all! 
Cupid's quiver struck my heart and 
Wrote a 
verse beginning with— 
Oh ! Bessy is the sweetest girl of all ; 
Then E 
felt just as happy 
As a 
bier sunflower, 
Nodding in the breezes high and tall. 
Then I 
saw entrancing beauty, 
And I 
felt its tender power, 
For I 
love Miss Bossy Doon the best of all. 
Oh! tell me why, etc. 
Ah ! I 
can no longer linger, 
For my time is growing short, 
But I 
hope to meet you all some day again; 
And if Bessie is a 
singer, 
Just to have a 
little sport 
I'll bring her here to sing a 
sad refrain. 
She will sing a 
sad farewell 
To the 'lobby little chaps— 
That dance in attendance to her call ; 
Say adieu to every belle, 
For 
marry soon perhaps, 
Miss Bossy Doon, the sweetest of them all. 
Oh ! te,I me why, etc.

'TwAs a 
lovely summer's day, 
And the birds were singing gay, 
While the flow'rs fill'd the air with odor sweet, 
Strolling leisurely along, 
Humming some old plaintive song, 
A 
charming little maiden I 
chanced to meet; 
She had eyes of bonny blue, 
And her cheeks a 
roseate hue, 
Like a 
fairy flitting thro' a 
garden bower; 
Oh she looked divinely fair, 
Picking posies here and there, 
While indeed she was herself the fairest flower. 
Pretty eyes of bonny blue, 
All my heart I 
give to you; 
Oh! she looked so sweet and fair, 
With her neck and shoulders bare; 
And my happy heart her image still embowers, 
I 
am like the little bee, 
Kissing every tlow'r I 
see, 
Since the day I 
met my love among the flowers. 
LOVE AMONG THE FLOWERS.—Continued. 
All enraptured I 
stood there, 
And I 
know it wasn't fair, 
For the blush went from the rose into her 
Turning round she seemed to smite, 
But with modesty the while, 
And respect and duty bade me then to speak: 
Pray excuse me, Miss, said I, 
But as I 
was passing by— 
Oh! I 
found this plain gold ring, and thought ' twas yours; 
Then she smiling, answered, no, 
Still she never bid me go, 
So we stood and talked awhile among 
cheek; 
the flowers. 
Viewing first the setting sun, 
Then we saw the rising moon, 
Sitting side by side upon the portico, 
While upon her little hand 
I 
had placed the golden band, 
And was waiting for her answer, yes or no 
Surely love was on the wing, 
Cupid there came wandering, 
And was seeking shelter from the dewy showers, 
When he saw each loving heart, 
Loathing evermore to part, 
Then he tied the knot of love acaong the flowers. 
Pretty eyes, etc.

Ah I 
believe me, fond fly, 'tis excessively sinful, 
This habit, which knocks even blue-bottles up; 
Remember what Cassio, on taking a 
skinful, 
Remarked about every inordinate cup. 
Pray, reflect on that proverb, diminutive being, 
Which says that " enough is as good as a 
feast;" 
And, believe me, there's nothing more painful, than veing 
An insect behaving so much like a 
beast.—O
HO. 
Nay! in vain would you seek to escape while Pm talking, 
And shake from your pinions the fast clinging drops; 
While it's painfully clear ( from your efforts at walking), 
That after your malt you intend to take hops. 
Say, where is your home, and, ohl how will you get there, 
And what will your wife and your family think; 
And how shall you venture to show the whole set there, 
That Paterfamilias is given to drink l'—Cuo. 
Oh! think of the moment when conseienee returning, 
Shall put the brief pleasures of Bacchus to flight; 
When the tongue shall be parched, and the brow shall be burning, 
And most of to-morrow shall taste of to-night. 
For thy toast shall be hard, and thy tea shall be bitter, 
And all through the breakfast one thought shall intrude: 
That a 
little pale brandy and seltzer were fitter 
For such an occasion, than animal food.—CRo. 
I 
have known, silly fly, the delight beyond measure. 
The blissful emotion, prolonged and intense; 
The rapturous, wild, and ineffable pleasure 
Of drinking at somebody else's expense. 
But, aim! when I've not used this privilege rightly, 
I've thought the next morning, on quitting my bed, 
That the skin was pulled over my countenance tightly. 
And tied in a 
knot at the back of my head.—C.

Music by C. T. DONDOB.E. 
IT 
tickled me so I 
liked to die, 
One Sunday afternoon— 
All dressed to kill from head to heel, 
Such a 
handsome little coon. 
When I 
seed de gals, my hat I 
raised, 
And how de white folks stared; 
Dar's little Bob, de nobby soul, 
Out on a 
promenade. 
Sroang.—Yes, I 
was slamenading around promiscusly, when 
my ' tention was ' tracted away by one of de lubliest affinities I 
eber had the opportunity of gazing upon. 
It was a 
female of 
de sassafras complexion, with de most becomenest dress, and 
de sweetestest waterfalls, and innocent mouth, and more of it 
dan any gal I 
ever seed before.

All dressed to kill I 
see her still, 
Leaning on de winder sill; 
She winked her eye as I 
passed by, 
Haugh ! it tickled me so I 
liked to die. 
I 
passed her on a 
block or so, 
But could not stay away; 
She shook her handkerchief after me, 
Which signified 0. K. 
She smiled so sweet when e 
did meet, 
I 
thought dat I 
should fly; 
It tickled me so when she asked me in, 
0, golly, I 
liked to die. 
SPOICEN.—But I 
declare to goodness I 
mustn't say much 
more about it, or I 
get to laughing so I 
can't tell you de story. 
All dressed to kill, etc. 
It's just about a 
year ago, 
Since what I 
told transpired; 
I 
asked her, please won't you be mine it 
Says she, ' if you desire." 
We're going to be married soon, 
You must be sure to be there; 
And I'll introduce you all around, 
To the fairest of the fair.

GET UP AND SHUT T 
 
FT Ft DOOR. 
C031IC SONG AND CHORUS. 
AT 
candle light John went to bed, 
In pleasant dreams he smiled; 
The loving spouse that he had wed 
Sat singing to his child; 
It went to sleep and so did she, 
But she woke up at four 
And found, as frightened as could be, 
She had not shut the door. 
CHORUS. 
" 
Oh, John! oh, John! don't lie here and snore, 
I 
forgot when I 
came to bed— 
Get up and shut the door." 
The baby took the colic bad, 
And soon began to scream, 
Though very jolly lungs it had, 
It ne'er disturbed John's dream; 
Ills wife sat up, half scared to death, 
And shook him more and more, 
Still shouting, " John 1" at every breath, 
" 
Get up and shut the door !" 
" 
Oh, John! oh, John," etc. 
" 
It is not as it used to be," 
She said—while she did weep; 
" 
I've seen the time you'd die for me, 
But here you lie and sleep !" 
The bed fell down, and they fell out, 
The babe did louder roar; 
" 
Thieves! thieves !" the wife began to shout, 
" 
Get up and shut the door !" 
" 
Oh, John! oh, John!" etc. 
But John still slumbered on serene, 
And here's the moral true: 
When husbands are first young and green, 
Dear wives, they'll wait on you ; 
But when a 
few years they have seen, 
And honeymoons are o'er, 
You -11 find out thus, the men won't e'en 
Get up and shut the door.

Written and Composed by Wm. H. DELEHANTY. 
Now everybody wonders I'm so happy— 
They criticize my gay and airy style, 
But if they knew the pretty little beauty 
That threw at me the sweetness of her smile, 
I'm sure they wouldn't wonder I 
was airy, 
Nor think that I'm in any way to blame, 
When I 
say I 
gave my heart up to a 
fairy— 
Yes, " Little Fairy Dew Drop" is her name. 
cuours. 
Oh! yes, she's like a 
fairy, 
Blithesome and airy— 
eouting lips of cherry, 
Smiling when we meet. 
Bright eyes when they view me, 
Piercing thro' and thro' me, 
Perfectly under me, 
Dew Drop is so sweet. 
One summer's day we went a-picking berries, 
Su ripe and running wild upon the hill, 
how carelessly we trod upon the daisies, 
So anxious were we then the pail to fill; 
And when the pail was full we sat and rested, 
'Twas just because I 
said she needed rest— 
And oh! how very sweet the berries tasted 
With little Dew Drop leaning on my breast. 
Oh ! yes, etc. 
I 
told her then my life was very lonesome, 
And bluntly asked her would she be my wife, 
And tho' I 
said, I 
knew I 
wasn't handsome, 
Still, I 
hoped with love to bless her all her life; 
She answered " yes," when we were homeward turning 
Thro' fields where corn was waving high above, 
While I 
think to hug or kiss we were a-learning, 
And no one heard our gentle tale of love. 
Oh! yes, etc. 
I KNOW A MAID WHO LOVES ME. 
Written by Wm. H. D KLEHANTY. 
I 
KN OW a 
maid who loves me, 
And has my heart in keeping, 
And every day she proves me 
Her love to me is leaping— 
Like dews of summer weeping, 
In tears the bud- rose steeping. 
CHORUS. 
Sweet Emma's of my life a 
part, 
The sunshine of my eye, 
The lore I 
feel within my heart, 
Can never change nor die. 
But if you chance to meet her, 
Her grace and beauty charming, 
Will make you fondly greet her 
With admiration warming— 
The heart of love alarming, 
But wishes free of harming. 
Sweet Emma's, etc. 
Hadist thou but heard her talking, 
Thine all attention given, 
Or by her side been walking 
That lovely summer even', 
While zephyrs flower-breath laden 
Made earth seem part of heaven. 
Sweet Emma's, etc. 
But dread the bitter ending, 
If when by her deserted, 
Bereft her sweet befriending, 
'Twere better death had started 
His round, nor leave thee parted, 
Forever broken hearted. 
Sweet Emma's, etc. ' 
Sung by DELEHANTT and IC EN GLEE. 
THE moon is out to-night, love, floating through the sky, 
The little stars are laughing as she passes by, 
All the little songsters sing their pretty tune, 
Happy as they can be singing to the moon. 
Clouds of silver lining waiting in the sky, 
For the moon to pass them; Jessie, so am I. 
For I've come to meet you with a 
happy smile, 
To tell you how I 
love you, sitting on the stile. 
CII ORE'S. 
The moon is out to-night, love, meet me with a 
smile, 
I've something sweet to tell you, sitting on the stile ; 
Kiss me when you meet me, Jessie of the Glen, 
And when I 
go to leave you I'll give it back again. 
The moon is out to-night, love, all the roses blush, 
When the gentle night winds tell the birds to hush, 
For I 
want to listen for a 
merry voice, 
Whose every note is music, and makes my heart rejoice; 
Jessie, I 
am watching to see if I 
can see 
Some one like a 
fairy coming towards me; 
Ah! the little angel coming once again, 
I've a 
kiss of true love for Jessie of the Glen. 
The moon is out, etc.

IIENGLEIL 
W E'VE got an awful malady the doctors cannot cure, 
There never was another case to equal us before; 
Our dad he scolds us up and down, but still it is no go, 
Our progress in the keep still line is most almighty slow. 
CHORUS. 
Now watch us sling our feet about, like magic how they fiy, 
t 
is no use, we feel so loose, we must sing, dance or die. 
We've worn out all the carpets, and kicked up every floor, 
Our mamma says if we don't stop, we'll ruin her house for sure; 
She begs us for to hush that noise, and we to mind her try, 
But it's born in us, that you'll agree, to sing, dance or die. 
Now watch us sling our feet, etc. 
We're known among the village folks, as the kickywicksy kids, 
And all we care for in this world is the sounding of the fids ; 
When we think of settling down to work it almost makes us cry; 
it's a 
settled fact of history, we must sing, dance or die. 
Now watch us sling our feet, etc.

Words by H A. DAELEY. 
Music by EAERY ELLIS. 
You talk about your pretty girls, so beautiful and fair, 
With all their wealth of golden curls, and their distinguished 
air ; 
But I 
know one you ne'er have seen, and her I 
love so well, 
She's just as peerless as a 
queen, is rosy little Nell. 
ctioaus 
I 
always see her in my dreams, (Symph..) 
She like an angel to me seems; (S!/mph.) 
Her eyes are like the stars above, on me she's cast a 
spell, 
My heart is flowing o'er with love for rosy little Nell. 
We often walk together upon an afternoon, 
'Tis pleasure in her company, I'm goinr, to wed her soon; 
She's promised that she'll have me, my joys none can excel, 
Then I 
indeed will happy be with rosy little Nell. 
1 
always see her, etc. 
I 
know she'll make a 
charming wife, and to me will prove true, 
She'll make a 
paradise of life, and strive to bear me through; 
going to build a 
little house in which we are to dwell, 
Then I 
shall call her all my own, my rosy little Nell. 
I 
always see her, etc. 
I WONDER WHAT'S HER NAME. 
A 
new Song and Dance, written by T. M. II ,.IGLE11. 
THERE is a 
darling gay and sweet, 
I 
meet her every day, 
She has a 
cunning, winning smile, 
And such a 
charming way; 
Each time I 
chance to pass her by, 
She always smiles the same ; 
She dresses neat and so complete, 
I 
wonder what's her name. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, she is so neat and so complete, 
She always smiles the same, 
I'd give the world if I 
knew, 
I 
wonder what's her name. 
(Repeat.) 
Last eve her elbow mine did touch, 
While standing in a 
throng, 
But quickly I 
apologized, 
And said, I 
mean no wrong; 
No harm, she said, for accidents, 
Like that are very tame, 
And then she left with a 
pretty smile, 
I 
wonder what's her name. 
Oh, she, etc. 
Perhaps to-night she's in the crowd, 
That has assembled here, 
With all my friends please look around, 
And find this pretty dear; 
If here, whoever points her out 
I'll not the slightest blame; 
Oh, tell me where this darling is, 
I 
wonder what's her name. 
Oh, she, etc. 
PRETTY LITTLE JESSIE. 
Written and Composed by Wit. H. 
DELEHANTT. 
OH! have you never met with pretty Jessie, 
She's the sweetest girl in town, 
And the summer of her smile would set you crazy, 
With hair and eyes so brown. 
If you should smile upon her, 
She'd tremble with delight, 
And deem it all an honor— 
Her sweet face blushing bright; 
Oh! you should see my pretty little Jessie, 
Her beauty shames the rose, 
She's fairer than the lily— 
The sweetest flower that grows. 
CHORUS. 
My heart with joy is dancing, 
With happiness I'm prancing, 
Oh! may the joy of life forever bless thee, 
Lovely queen of every rose. 
Surpassing is my Jessie— 
The sweetest flower that grows. 
Now I 
have seen the dewdrop in the rosebud, 
Little stars drop from the skies, 
Like pretty Jessie when she wears a 
red hood, 
The dewdrops are her eyes; 
Oh! who would dare to crush her, 
A sweet and tender flower, 
And who would dare to hush her, 
While singing in her bower; 
'Tis joy for me to sit beneath her window, 
And hear her sing her song; 
When summer's perfumed winds blow, 
I'd sit there all day long. 
My heart, etc. 
I 
sometimes think that I 
am going crazy, 
My ways I 
can't improve, 
For since the day I 
met with pretty Jessie, 
I 
fly on wings of love. 
I 
see the white- cap daisy 
Its welcome to her bend, 
As well, the pink and posie, 
For Jessie is their friend. 
This evening she and I 
were in the garden— 
When I my suit did press ; 
And when I 
popped the question, 
She blushingly answered yes. 
My heart, etc.

WEBSTER'S BUSINESS MAN 
treats upon every topic incidental 
to the experience of a 
business man. 
While its main design is to instruct the 
reader in the details of commercial corresponuence, the subject matter of these 
specimen letters embrace all points of interest to the general trader. 
Prominence has been given to banking, and the relationship between bank-
ers and their dealers, inasmuch as hundieds of thousands of persons main-
taining accounts of deposit and discount, are in ignorance of the duties of 
bankers and of the the rights and privileges of the dealer. 
To the body of the work has been appended :-
1. A Glossary of the Technicalities of Commerce, or terms employed by mer-
cantile men at borne and abroad, as a

the latest revised copy, and is the cheapest in the world. 
PRICE TWENTY-FIVE CENTS EACH. 
NEWTON FOSTER.— One pe-
rusal of this will give a 
clearer idea 
of a 
seaman's existence than a 
voy-
age around the mm. 
MIDSHIPMAN EASY.—This 
writer never wrote a 
dull book, and 
this one is the least of all open to 
that fault. 
PETER. SIM PLE.— 
This is one 
of the best sea stories in any lan-
guage. 
Thousands have laughed 
at the locker full of fun that the 
Captain opens for all. 
PACIIA OF MANY TALES. 
The many tales will be found equal 
to one smother, and all excellent, 
and never tedious in length. 
THE PIRATE AND THE 
THREE CU ' I' 
Ens. 
— 
Frowning men, clambering aboard 
contested craft; shots exchanged ; 
cutlasses clashing—in short, fierce 
encounters fill these thrilling pages. 
THE KING'S OWN. — Unal-
loyed enjoyment—the sea-breeze, 
the exciting espisodes, the novel 
scenes and persons, without the 
discomforts attending them. 
JAPHET IN SEARCH OF 
A FATHEIC.—There has risen 
not one worthy to wield Marryatt's 
pen. 
No reader regrets starting 
out with Japhet in his long search. 
SNAILLEYOW, grnE DOG 
FIEND.— If laughing makes peo-
ple increase in bulk, " Snarleyow " 
would have been found guilty of 
making- Daniel Lamberts of the 
huma.i race. 
JAC011 FAITHFUL. — There 
has rarely been a 
man placed in a 
position so fitted for seeing the sail-
or's life as Captain Marryatt, and 
never one so able in portraying it. 
FRANK MILDMAY. — Per-
haps in no other work does Marry-
att better evince his talent than he 
does in " Frank Mildmay." None 
can beat the " Cap." 
PERCiVAL KEENE. — A 
thorough knowledge of every wish, 
hope, and fear of a 
sailor, makes 
Marryatt the best nautical novelist 
that ever lived. 
PHANTOM SHIP.— Now, if 
anybody knows more about " Wiz-
ard Skiffs" and " Flying Dutch-
men" than Marryatt, he can take 
our tarpaulin. 
IRATLIN, THE REEFER.— 
The happiest days of our existence 
were when we were " laying off " 
in the foretop of old " lronsides," 
reading this charming book to our 
all-delighted rnessmates. 
THE POACHER. — 
Marryatt 
proves that he could write as well 
of " shore" life. 
The adventures 
of Joseph Rushbrook are at once 
very extraordinary and very affect-
ing. 
POOR JACK.—The history of 
this little sea- side waif is one of the 
most genuine narratives of a 
sailor-
boy's cluise that has ever been en-
tered in the log-book of life.
