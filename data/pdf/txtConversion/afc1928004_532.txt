JAMES O'NEIL AND JACK CONROY. 
THE lovers of humorous acting and first-class comic 
singing will be gainers by the business union of the above 
named artists. 
They form a 
team hard to equal, im-
possible to beat. 
Each in his special department is simply 
immense. 
Their popularity has been steadily increasing 
—it is no transient " flash in the pan "—but a 
clear 
bright light that illmnes with pleasure the smiling faces 
of the hosts of admirers and friends that they have made 
wherever they have appeared. 
Who that has heard 
James O'Neil give his many popular songs, will ever for-
get how he contrives to invest every point with interest ? 
how Jack Conroy, too, brings down the house with his 
own particular pieces ? 
But it is now that they perform 
nightly together that they come out in full force; as 
when they treat their listeners to the inimitable pieces 
" 
Hungry Boarding House," " Braunigan's Pup," " Delia 
Clancy," " Two Bad Men," and " What Is It." 
The 
songs we have named are taken by chance out of their 
abundant repertoire. 
They have dozens equally good. 
We have no doubt that appearing together they will more 
than double the score of successes that they have won 
at " single wicket "—(if we may " pitch in " such a 
com-
parison)—by their genuine merits, both as artists and 
gentlemen.

WHAT IS IT ? 
COMIC CHARACTER SONG. 
Words and Music by DONLY. 
Sung with immense success by JANES 
O'NEIL. 
Music published and Copyright, 1879, by E. II. HAI:DING. 
The Music of this song, will be sent to any address, post paid, on receipt 
of price, 40 cents. 
IT'S very strange, indeed, to me, 
That go where'er I 
may, 
So many remarks I 
hear 
About me every day. 
'Twas but last night upon the street 
-My style the boys did quiz. 
And one says " you can have it, pards, 
If you can guess what it is I" 
SPOKEN.— As soon as they saw ate, they shouted, 
" 
Here it comes I" and as I 
approached they all began 
to sing,— 
CHOIttS. 
What is it, Heitvens, what is it ? 
Is it a 
chromo ? 
Does it live, do you know ? 
Did it blow out or did it grow out ? 
For Heaven's sake what is it ? 
'Twas in the park, a 
lively mob 
At me did talk and stare, 
" 
I 
wonder if it's loaded, and 
If that's all it's own hair," 
" 
It lives, it breathes," one chap did say, 
" 
Its pulse is all serene." 
Approaching me, " old krauk," says he, 
" 
see that you're kept green " 
SROKEN. — Yes, and when I 
say a 
word back, they shout, 
" 
look out for it, it's teethin' I " and then again comes 
the conundrum— 
What is it, etc. 
They asked how long I 
walked alone, 
And say " when were you canned," 
And hint, I'd look much better if 
Upon my head I'd stand ; 
(1) 
-> 
WHAT IS IT ?—Concluded. 
And as around the square I 
walk, 
With Owes and cane and pipe, 
I 
hear them whisper ey'ry where. 
" 
I 
wonder if it's ripe ! 
SPOKEN.—Yes, and they want to know if I'm natural 
or artificial, and how many of me there are in a 
bunch, 
and whether I'm good raw ! 
But above all, they wildly 
ask— 
What is it, etc. 
THE JOLLY IRISH SPORTS. 
Written and Sung by JACK CONROY alld JAS. O'N EIL. 
W E'RE a 
couple of high-toned men ; 
That's what the people say, 
'We belong to the upper ten, 
And our style is neat and gay ; 
The ladies all at ns smile, 
And say we're full of our tricks, 
Their hearts we do beguile 
And we carry our gold-headed sticks. 
• 
CHORUS. 
'With our 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0, 7, 8, ha, ha, 
Sure we always tra In In In, 
With our tita tit tit tit ta, 
We never smoke a 
pipe 
But a 
La Tinidad Cigar, 
Chinese Cigars we hate, we belong to the 
Board of Health, 
And we're always able to treat, 
We're the boys that carry the wealth. 
In summer when we are out, 
To Long Branch we resort, 
The swells they point us out 
As the Jolly Old Irish Sports. 
-Whenever we get in a 
fight, 
We're bound to make them sick, 
We strike out left and right, 
Sure we always could handle the stick 
With our 1, 2, 3, etc.

BRANNIGAN'S PUP. 
Sang by O'NEIL and CoNnoy. 
Now old Mickey Brannigan had a 
bull pup, 
He was bred of rale elegant stock ; 
For seventeen hours a 
battle he fought, 
He aid, by my soul, by the clock. 
His tail was a 
neat little bit of a 
stump, 
Bow-legged and two crooked eyes. 
One look at his ugly looking mug was enough, 
He was the divil himself in disguise. 
CHORCS. 
Bow-ow-ow, what a 
pup to be sure, 
For fighting he'd never give up ; 
There never was known such a 
wonderful dog, 
As Mickey Brannigan's pup. 
He tore the tail off Maloney's best coat, 
Ate the bustle of Mary Ann Flynn, 
And run between young Kitty Mulligan's legs, 
Now wasn't that truly a 
sin. 
He caught up the Dutch shoemaker's dog, 
And shook him around like a 
rat, 
He murdered Tim Finnegan's beautiful goat, 
Ate the tail off McManus's cat. 
Bow-ow-ow, etc. 
An Italian came round with an organ one day, 
And a 
monkey tied fast to a 
string ; 
And when the pup saw them he yowled with delight, 
And made a 
most wonderful spring. 
He upset monkey, grinder and all, 
And bursted the organ inside ; 
And be jabers he tried to swallow the monk. 
But he choked on his tail and he died. 
Bow-ow-ow, etc.

DUFFY'S OPENING NIGHT. 
Originally sung by JACK CONROY. 
DID you ever hear tell of Pat Duffy ? 
He came from the County Mayo. 
Last week, shure, he started a 
bar-room 
Down in the Fourth Ward below. 
There was lager, free lunch, and whiskey. 
Faith, indeed, 'twas an elegant sight; 
But the boys, one and all, they got frisky 
On Duffy's grand opening night. 
cnon.us. 
Ah, but Duffy sold horrible liquor; 
It would knock you up high as a 
kite, 
And the bar I'm sure never looked sicker 
Than on Duffy's grand opening night. 
Poor Duffy sent out invitations, 
And invited his neighbors to come. 
He told them he'd treat them all dacent, 
And give them their fill of good rum. 
They came there in droves and by dozeps, 
And got into a 
terrible fight. 
They broke all the doors and the windows 
On Duffy's grand opening night. 
Ah, but Duffy, etr, 
They stole all the stock that he had there, 
And drank all his whiskey so sweet ; 
They took both his clothes and his money, 
And threw him out into the street. 
They scattered his family, and left him 
To roam in a 
terrible plight. 
Poor Duffy now lives on free lunches 
Since he gave the grand opening night. 
Ali, but Duffy, etc.

LARRY IVIcGEE'S WEDDING. 
sung with great success by J. H. CoxuoY, at GILL'S ENTERPRISE, 15 West 
Houston street. 
Pay attention awhile, and I'll sing you a 
ditty, 
About the grand wedding of Larry McGee, 
Who dwelt in a 
fashionable part of the city, 
In an elegant mansion in Avenue D— 
About the grand time we had at the wedding, 
Where whiskey and fun flew around so free, 
And the dancing and singing got the room ringing, 
At the grand wedding of Larry McGee. 
There was Con Donohue with his old fiddle, 
McGuinness the fishman, and Jerry McShane ; 
O'Brien and O'Callahan, and Timothy Widdle, 
Who brought to the .wedding his new accordeon. 
There was big Andy Elgin, the great whiskey drinker, 
Barney Fitzgibbons and Dennis Farlee • 
McCloskey the butcher, old Doyle the tinker, 
Were welting the floor at gay Larry 'McGee's. 
The guests of both sexes all ate very hearty, 
And crammed themselves well into the wind pipe ; 
An accident happened to Mollie McCarty, 
Who half choked herself with a 
large piece of tripe, 
You ought to see Riley sail into the mutton, 
He caused the ladies to titter with glee ; 
He fasted two weeks, the dirty old glutton, 
To clear off the table at Larry McGee's. 
(1) 
LARRY MeGEE'S WEDDING.—Concluded. 
When the sipper was over, the accordeon and fiddle 
Struck up the grand wedding of Bally Poreen ; 
The bride made a 
call upon Timothy Widdle, 
Who sang the night Larry was stretched on the green. 
McGuinness the Fishman sang " Croppy By Galls," 
O'Holohau gave us the Boy's Traleigh ; 
And Kitty McNally sang the Sprig of Shillaleli, 
At the grand wedding of Larry McGee. 
We danced and we sang for two hours and a 
quarter, 
And then we drank whiskey until we were sick ; 
When big Andy Elgin swore the whiskey was water, 
And Flaherty levelled him out with a 
stick. 
The ladies they roared and they cried blue blazes, 
And Roach broke his fiddle on the back of Farlee, 
And Doyle seized a 
dumpling, bless us and save us, 
Which he stuffed in the mouth of pool' Mrs. McGee. 
When Larry now saw that his friends had some liquor, 
And if he'd not stop them, some harm it would come, 
He told them 'twas twelve o'clock by the ticker, 
And to fill up their glasses before going home. 
They did so and drank a 
toast from Pat Riley, 
Who hoped before long a 
young Larry to see; 
The bride gave a 
smile and bowed so genelly, 
That wound up the wedding of Larry McGee.

Waltzingham McSweeney, 
A 
man well known to fame, 
I'm a 
shining light at all the clubs, 
I'm a 
man of pluck and game. 
I'm the best known man on Broadway, 
On account of my form and face, 
And the stylish way I 
carry myself, 
With a 
walk of air and grace. 
I'm the one you can't help notice, 
I'm a 
man of splendid parts, 
I've a 
high-born education, 
1.111 accomplished in all the arts, 
I 
can swim like Captain Boyton, 
I 
can walk a 
Highland fling, 
I 
can pull a 
boat with Hanlon, 
I'm a 
crack shot On the wing. 
Waltzingham McSweeney, 
That's the cognomen I 
bear, 
The ladies admire my pretty shape, 
And aristocratic air. 
The swells they all get jealous, 
When the dashing girls at me leer ; 
For my graceful glide in the ball- room. 
I'm called the gay cavalier. 
WALTZINGHAIVI McSWEENEY, THE GAY 
CAVALIER.— Concluded. 
I'm a 
great pedestrian walker, 
My record dates far back, 
I'd be sure to beat O'Leary, 
If they'd let me on the track. 
I'm known at all the races, 
My bets are all the boast, 
I 
eau always name the winning horse 
Before he leaves the post. 
All politicians seem to know me, 
They shake my hand with pride, 
For they know my great influence 
In elections turn the tide. 
All the Congressmen and Senators 
Admire me everywhere, 
And Waltzingham McSweeney, 
Some say will be your mayor. 
Waltzingham McSweeney, etc. 
At Rockaway or Long Branch 
I'm great Mogul of all ; 
And the landlords of the big hotels 
They fight to have me call. 
And all the bathers upon the beach, 
They watch me do the grand, 
And the Lords and Dukes and ladies fair, 
Feel proud to shake my hand. 
When I 
walk out in my bathing- suit, 
And step upon the beach, 
The opera- glasses are levelled at me, 
As far as the eye can reach ; • 
And your Lords and Dukes are no where, 
Like a 
flower they fade away, 
When Waltzingham McSweeney 
Steps into the boiling sea. 
Waltzingham McSweeney, etc. , 
WHEN MeGUINESS GETS A JOB. 
Sang by O'NzIL and CONROY. 
LAST winter was a 
hard one, Mrs. Reily, did you say ? 
Well, ' tis myself that knows it, for it's many's the day 
Your husband wasn't the only man sat behind the wall ; 
There's my old man McGuiuess didn't get no job at all ; 
The Politicians promised him work on the Boulevard 
To handle a 
pick and shovel and, throw dirt on the 
cart. 
Ali, six months ago they promised him work he'd shortly 
get, 
But believe me, my good woman, they are promising him 
yet. 
CHOTtCS. 
Then cheer up, Mrs. Rally, don't give away to the blues, 
You and I 
will cut a 
shine, new bonnets and new shoes ; 
As for me I'm done a 
crying, no more will I 
sigh or sob, 
I'll wait till tims gets better when M.2erainess gets a 
job. 
The Italians, the devil take them, why didn't they stay 
at home, 
Sire we had plenty of our own class to ate up all our 
own; 
They come out like bees in summer-time and sworn for 
to stay ; 
WHEN MeGUINESS GETS A JOB.—Concluded. 
The contractors they have hundreds for forty cents a 
day, 
They work upon the railroad, they shovel snow and 
slush, 
But there's one thing in their 
favor, Italians they 
40•4 
never do get lush ; 
No, they always bring their money home, taste no gin or 
wine, 
And that one thing I'd like to say of your old man and 
mine. 
Then cheer up, Mrs. Reilly, etc. 
Ah I 
the spring-time now is coming we'll all have plenty 
work, 
McGuiness will go back to his trade, shure he's a 
hand-
some clerk. 
You should see him climb the ladder as nimble as a 
fox, 
Faith he's the boy can hanale the mild three-cornered 
box. 
The boss is always bawling, Hi ! there, don't you stop, 
Keep your eyes upward, don't let no mortar drop ; 
Ah ! the old man he is always careful, nothing he let's 
The divil a 
word you'd hear him say to my old man at 
Then cheer up, Mrs. Reily, etc.

And a

And creamy cream of the style, do you mind, 
Wid a

Of a 
color as bright as the red blue say, 
Oh, it's on the street, there's few you'll meet 
Like Levi Eassiday. 
A-down the street with stately tread, 
And style that dislocates them all, 
'Meanders he, enveloped in 
A 
brand new fresh spring suit of gaul 
Ijpon his arm hangs Julia Ann, 
Sweet lady bird of this daisy man. 
A Don Johannes in his mind is he, 
This Levi Kassiday. 
For he's a 
man, etc. 
When -voices sweet were handed round, 
Levi was not behind the door, 
An over strung bass voice has he, 
He sang the ' mast " in " Pinafore." 
From Asiali to Kalamazu, 
From Canadaw to San Francisco, 
Another one of it you'll seldom meet 
Like Levi Kassiday. 
For he's a

THEEE'S sixteen dacent families 
In the house where I 
reside ; 
On summer nights to cheer ourselves 
All pleasures we have tried, 
But on the roof it's best of all, 
To hear us would be proof, 
We make the neighborhood resound, 
All singing on the roof. 
CHOLUS. 
Singing on the roof, the boys and girls together ; 
We play the concertina, likewise the sweet banjo, 
The Murphys and O'Neils come up to see the weather, 
We're highly elevated until we go below. 
Now up comes Mistress Hoolahan, 
With the baby in her arms, 
With pleasant conversation then, 
Sure every one she charms. 
There's Rosy Dunn and Reiley's son, 
And a 
Russian named O'Goofe, 
With voices loud, they join the crowd, 
All singing on the roof. 
Singing, etc. 
Young Roger Flynn got up to dance, 
With a 
lady from next door, 
" 
Come welt the tin," says Roger Flynn, 
" 
It's like- a 
ball-room floor." 
Then one by one they joined the fun, 
Sure, none could hold aloof, 
It was a 
sight that summer night, 
To see them on the roof. 
Singing, etc. 
Now that's the place to spend the night, 
And feel that pleasant breeze, 
Take up your pipe and stretch yourself 
In an attitude of ease. 
The boys and girls will gather round, 
And fill the air with glee, 
When singing on the roof at night, 
As happy as can be.

THE PITCHER OF ALE.

Au.—" Pitcher of Beer." 
I'LL sing you a 
song of a 
friend true and strong, 
The same time I'll strive to be brief— . 
Although ' tis a 
fact, he is often quite cracked, 
Yet to him you'll go for relief. 
No word has he spoken, no word has he broken, 
It does seem a 
curious tale, 
Though filled every night he never gets tight, 
I 
speak of a 
pitcher of ale. 
CHORE'S. 
Each day in the week, while too full to speak, 
Each morn and each night without fail— 
With hearts free from care, strong friendship we'll swear . 
As we drink from the pitcher of ale. 
The rich man he goes to Dehnonico's, 
And orders his bottle of wine, 
'Neath chandeliers bright, he sits late night, 
In the parlor so spacious and fine. 
He sits at his ease and drinks as he please, 
Of champagnd to wash down the quail, 
Though seeming quite gay, yet this I 
will say, 
I'd as leave have the pitcher of ale. 
Each day in the week, etc. 
I 
think with a 
sigh of the days now gone by, 
When gathered around in a 
group— 
"We'd make the air ring, with the songs we would sin 
While seated upon some front stoop. 
The cool summer breeze blew calm 'Leath the trees, 
The planets shone softly and pale, 
When as a 
wind-up, we'd pass round the cup, 
Filled from the pitcher of ale. 
Each kl;tv in the week, 
THE TRUE SONS OF ERIN. 
Sung by JACIi. CONROY and GEORGE HUNTER. 
DON'T be alarmed at seeing us here, 
We are gents of the very first water ; 
Our appearance will show we are noblemen too ; 
And sons of a 
nobleman's daughter ; 
Our mother, God bless her, she doted on us, 
For all her pleasures we made ; 
We are commanders now in the army, 
In the ranks of the Irish Brigade. 
CITORT:S. 
Hurrah ! hurrah for the true sons of Erin, 
The stout-hearted soldiers who are never afraid ; 
They are true to the core and dare- devil daring. 
The true noble sons of the Irish Brigade. 
We marched to the front with nine hundred strong, 
In a 
line thro' the dead and dying, 
We marched gayly on with the fife and the drum; 
"While the green flag above us was flying, 
Yes, high in the air it proudly did wave, 
Seemingly not afraid, 
For it knew that protection was near, 
From the boys in the Irish Brigade. 
Hurrah ! hurrah, etc.. 
The Irish brigade is both strong and brave, 
For fighting the best in the land, 
And if you're in trouble the true sons of Erin 
Will willingly extend a 
hand ; 
Yes, they will give as long as they live 
One-half of which they possess 
To the needy and poor who come to their door 
With a 
cry for help in distress. 
Hurrah ! hurrah. tte.

THE learned Professor Hogan 
Wore his brains down in his feet, 
The light fantastic heel he taught, 
Exceeding line and neat ; 
Of pupils he had plenty, 
His style was so tip-top, 
And every week he gave his boys 
A 
free and easy hop. 
CHORUS. 
" 
Partners for the Dublin Glide !" 
Hogan loud would call, 
Then his fiddle and his foot, 
Would echo thro' the hall. 
In the glide they glode with ease, 
Till each one had lost their breeze, 
Oh, how they'd clip, and trip, and slip ! 
At Barney Hogan's Hop. 
In Hogan's mob it's fun alive, 
And not great style they prize, 
No satin trains to pulverize, 
Nor " jools " to blind the eyes. 
The etikat is aisy, too, 
At any girl you pop, 
Her belt you grip, and then you trip 
Around in Hogan's Hop. 
Partners for the, etc. 
Bidale McCann and Kassiday 
So grandly took the floor, 
And jigs and round quadrilles were danced, 
As never danced before. 
They tackled then a 
German waltz, 
Alas ! they flaneed no more. 
Its hay then dialect had sprained 
Their glide forevermore.

LAST Wednesday I 
attended a 
raffle for a 
stove, 
In aid of the wife and family of Timothy J. Cosgrove ; 
Kellys, Hogans, and O'Briens, all came in a 
drove, 
To take the dice and shake them nice, and try and win 
the stove. 
CHORUS. 
Forward Four, Altman Left, while the musiC it did play ; 
'Twas grand delight to see the sight of those Irishmen so 
gay. 
I 
never laugh'd so hearty in the course of all my life, 
Looking at Plug McCarthy, pivotin' with his wife. 
At nine o'clock precisely the raffling it begun, 
Tom Kelly he jump'd ten feet high when sixty four was 
flung; 
O'Brien yell'd out murder, with a 
brick his eye was closed ; 
On that night I 
had to fight, while raffling for the stove, 
Forward Four, etc. 
At six o'clock in the morning the raffling it was o'er, 
Tom Kelly he got staving drunk and stole away the door ; 
Clancy with a 
bottle, sure he all the windows broke ; 
When Cosgrove grabb'd him by the neck, and boys, I 
thought he'd choke.

She has " Milliner " on the door, 
Augustine Delia Clancy is the belle. 
It's every Monday night,

And all these lovely songs she sings to me :

She sings, she sings " Sweet Bye and Bye," 
Oh ! go to sleep, My Baby Mine, 
She sings, she sings such lovely tunes, 
The girl I 
love I'll marry soon. 
There is Owen Smith and Brady, 
The Misses Scott and Doyle, 
Sitting in the parlor all the while; 
Sure Smith so queer does talk, 
And has such a 
funny walk,

'When Miss Clancy does appear, 
Such curious things you hear :

Eight years ago, I

HIGH WATER PANTS. 
Sung by O'N EIL and CONROY. 
Mr nama is O'Brien from Harlem, 
I'm an Irishman as you can see, 
I 
can sing like a 
thrush or a 
starling, 
Or the little bird up in the tree. 
Bat the gang that stands on the corner 
Are trying the steps and the dance, 
They shout oat whenever I'm passing, 
" 
There is O'Brien with his High Water Pants." 
They tell me to go over to England, 
And pay a 
short visit to France, 
And there to bring out my new fashions, 
And call them the High Water Pants. 
Last week I 
went to the theatre, 
Along with my first cousin Dan ; 
We hired a 
seat down in the parquette 
Militia the big man in the band. 
When a 
nigger came out with a 
banjo, 
He played up a 
highland clog dance, 
And he gave out a 
gag and conundrum 
About O'Brien with his High Water Pants. 
They tell me to go over, etc. 
T'other night as I 
strolled down the Bowery, 
Along with a 
friend, Paddy Brock, 
We thought we'd drop into Geoghan's 
For a 
glass of his Rye and Rock. 
When the gang says there's Dan O'Leary, 
The bartender shot me a 
glance ; 
Hold your tongue, says he to the loafers, 
That's O'Brien with his High 
Water Pants. 
They tell me to go over, etc.

THE GREAT IRISHMEN OF THE PAST. 
Written by the greatest of all European Vocalists, PAT FEENEY. 
First sung in the United States by JACK CONROY, Irish Vocalist. 
Copyright, 1830, by JOHN CONROY. 
YOU'VE heard of the heroes of far famed old England,' 
That fought for their country on land and on wave, 
And -bards of famed Scotland have sung songs and 
praises, 
And many brave sons that are laid in the grave ; 
But I 
as an Irishman now sing in praise 
Of Erin's bold sons whose fame ever will last ; 
From the days of bold Bryon, the king of old Ireland, 
We have had many brave Irishmen of the past. 
There's Curran the lawyer, a 
son of old Erin, 
Whose sayings and doings are known far and wide, 
His wit and his elegant manner of speaking 
Won many foes over as friends, to his side ; 
There's Tom Moore the poet, all Irishmen love him. 
His work with the greatest on earth might be. classed ; 
Whilst an Irishman lives those two names they'll re-
member, 
AS 
two of the great Irishmen of the past.

27 
THE GREAT IRISHMEN OF THE PAST . - 
Concluded. 
There are scores of great speakers whom I 
could now 
mention, 
But foremost is Burke, who is well known to fame. 
His great nine days' speech was more than nine days' 
wonder— 
All men should respect that great Irishman's name. 
There is Goldsmith, well known as an elegant writer, 
And Dean Swift, the great wit, though they call his 
style fast ; 
And bold *Isaac Butt, who has lately passed from us, 
All these have proved great Irishmen of the past. 
Lord Wellington he was a 
son of old Erin, 
And a 
credit I'm sure to the land of his birth, 
As a 
ttue-hearted man and a 
prince of all soldiers, 
All England knows well that great Irishman's worth ; 
It was him that first conquered the mighty Napoleon, 
He feared not the foe nor the winter's cold blast, 
And as things stand at present old England could do 
with 
Some more like the great Irishmen of the past. 
The greatest- of Irishmen now I 
will mention; 
O'Connell the patriot it is that I 
mean, 
his life he spent struggling for old Ireland's freedom, 
And the good of the dear little Island of green ; 
For wit and for eloquence none could approach him, 
His name and his fame through all ages will last. 
Every true Irish heart loves the name of O'Connell, 
The greatest of great Irishmen of the past.

THE HUNGRY MAN FROM HARLEM. 
Sung with immense success by JAMES O'NEIL. 
OF 
a 
hungry man I'm going to sing, 
And tears to your eyes it will surely bring, 
He could swallow almost anything, 
This hungry man from Harlem. 
He'd eat a 
hundred times a 
day 
And for his board he could not pay, 
He could get outside of a 
bale of hay, 
This hungry man from Harlem 
CHORUS. 
The way he'd eat it couldn't be beat 
All kinds of meat both sour and sweet, 
He'd eat everything they had in the place, 
And bite a 
big chunk from his mother-in-law's face. 
He chewed up his father, devoured his mother, 
He swallowed his sister and tackled his brother, 
He swallowed the clock, bit a 
hole in the door, 
Chewed a 
hole in the roof and swallowed the floor, 
He chewed up his shoes and chewed up this hat, 
Made a 
raid on the kitchen and swallowed the cat. 
He chewed umbrellas and eat seven stoves, 
And bit off one-half of the servant girl's nose. 
And that's the way he used to eat, 
This hungry man from Harlem.

He eat so much it made him thin, 
His hair fell out and his cheeks fell in, 
His bones were sticking thro' his skin,

He struck this city one flue day 
And for a 
meal he could not pay, 
He took a 
walk along Broadway, 
This hungry man from Harlem. 
The way he'd eat, etc.. 
The very first thing he chanced to meet 
'Twas a 
German Band coming down the street, 
He swallowed them all, as fast as they come, 
He chewed up the music and eat the base-drum. 
He tackled a 
crowd coming home from a 
ball, 
They began for to dance and he swallowed them all. 
He went down to the ferry and swallowed a 
boat, 
He went out on election and chewed up his vote. 
At last he came into Brooklyn town, 
He met a 
big preacher, and gobbled him down; 
He swallowed a 
pump, put his teeth thro' the handle, 
And eat the reports of the Brooklyn scandal. • 
Then, gaffing disgusted with grub so light, 
He swallowed himself clean out of sight, 
.And that's the way he used to eat, 
This hungry man from Harlem.

Susannah McManus, sure that was her name, 
And a 
fine dacent girl, be the way, 
Till that nagur minstrel came into the town. 
Bad cess to that very same day ! 
Meself and Susannah we went to the show, 
Which caused me a 
dollar to spend, 
And Susannah was struck with the fellow that played 
On the tambourine there on the end.

The curtain wint down, and then it wint up, 
And that very same divil came out, 
-With a 
grin and a 
kick, and a

Like a 
monkey he wriggled about. 
He straddled a 
chair with a 
quare-looking thing ; 
He called it a 
bingo I 
think; 
He sang and looked at Susannah, he did, 
And gave her an old-fashioned wink.

She packed up her duds on the very next day, 
And straightway she wint from her home, 
And she sent me a 
letter and said she was gone

I'll gouge him I 
I'll fight him I 
I'll kick him ! I'll

For taking Susannah McManus away.

Oh, Molly, I

You've stolen the heart from my breast;

When young vagabonds rob its nest.

Who rode along with me.

BRIGADIER BRANIGAN. 
WHEN I 
was a 
single young man, the girls they all tried to 
please me; 
To be merry was always my plan, for devil a 
thing could tease 
Me ; 
was always merry and gay, how I 
jigged it with Judy O'Ca-
lagati. 
Until, like a 
poor ninny one day, I 'listed with Brigadier Bra-
nigan. 
SPOREN.—The Brigadier was a 
tall, slim man, about six feet 
five, and as fine a 
looking man as you'd meet in a 
day's walk— 
people used to take rue for the Brigadier.—He used to come in-
to my mother's shebeen-shop every morning., for a 
noggin of whis-
key, and he'd talk to me about the battles he was in and the 
battles he wasn't in ; about the Generals he killed and the Gen-
erals that killed him, until he had me as full of military ardor 
as an egg is full of 
meat. 
One morning he said to me, 
" 
Paddy," said he, " will you take a 
snilling's faith ?" 
Said 1, 
" 
I 
will, for I'm dead broke this minute." " Oh," said he, " you 
don't understand me, the Queen wants men." " Well," said I, " I 
know plenty of women that want men, besides the Queen." 
No, 
no, that's not what I 
mean," said he, " will you list ?" " I 
don't 
mind if I 
do," said I. 
So 1 
donned the regimentals and off I 
started to his 
CUOIIUS. 
Rub a 
dub dub, a 
dub, doo whack fa lar a 
ladidy, 
Rub a 
dub dub, a 
dub, doo whack fa lar a 
ladidy. 
Soon we were marching away, and over the fields I 
was footing 
it ; 
But something told me all the day, arrah, Paddy, you're put-
ting your foot in it; 
Och, hone, how the girls they did cry, especially Judy O'Cala-
gan; 
Who I 
left with a 
tear in ray eye, to go marching with Briga-
i 
dier Branigan. 
SeoxEN.—We were all drawn up in ra.sp and file—or rank and 
file as he Brigadier called it. 
One fine morning I 
walked over 
to him a.. nolite as you please. " Good morning, your honor," 
said I; " would you he after taking a 
drop of the creater this 
morning ?" " I 
don't mind if I 
do," said he, so over the road 
(

BRIGADIER BRANIGAN.—Continued. 
we started to a 
shebeen-shop and I 
called for a 
half pint. I 
was 
pouring out a 
noggin for him, when he grabbed the mug out of 
my hand. " Hould on, Paddy, me boy," said he ; " discipline 
among the men. 
The privates are never allowed to drink while 
the officers are around." 
He put the mug to his mouth and 
divil a 
sup he left for poor me. " Fall in !" he cried. " Arrah, 
we'll not fall out," said I. " Stand at ase !" " How can I 
when 
there's a 
big cobble stone under my right foot ?" " Forward, 
march !" 
I 
didn't execute the order quick enough, he drew 
his sword and hit me with,the flat of it across the hip, which 
made me limp off to his 
Rub a 
dub, etc. 
Soon into battle we went, where the bullets where shooting and 
flying sure ; 
Where many a 
poor fellow lay killed and many another lay 
dying sure; 
A 
bombshell came flying o'er me, I 
was thinking of Judy O'Ca-
laaan; 
With the Brigadier's head it made free, faith it finished Briga-
dier Branigan. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, there we stood, Murphy on one side, I 
on the 
other and the Brigadier in the middle, when along came a 
bomb-
shell 
taking the head clean off the Brigadier. " Hurrah !" 
cried Murphy, raising his hand. " We're free at last!" when 
along came another bombshell, taking the band right off of 
Murphy. " Arrah !" cried Murphy, " I've lost me hand ! I've 
lost me hand !.' " Hould your gab, you black-guard," said I, 
" 
there's the Brigadier has lost his head, and divil a 
word he 
says about it." 
I 
went over to where be was lying. " Are you kilt '?" said I 
He didn't condescend to speak to me. " If you have any request 
to make," said I, " if you tell me what it is, I 
will do it for you." 
" 
Paddy," said he, " I'm not kilt, but I'm murdered, and spach-
less, and if you have any regards for me, you'll be after going 
over the field and looking for my head, place it on my should-
ers, and see me buried decently." " 
do that same," said I. 
• 
So over the field I 
went, looking for his head; at last I 
came to 
it, trying to roll over to a 
canteen full of whiskey. 
I 
knew it was his head, for he had a 
big pimple on the side 
of his nose. I 
brought it over to him. " There's your head," said 
1. 
" No Paddy, that's not my head." " Yes it is," said I. " No, 
it's not," said he. " Well, head or no head," said I, " divil an-
other head you'll get from me !" So I 
threw his head in his face 
and I 
ran off singing 
Rub a 
dub. etc.

On, I'm one that's fond of pleasure ; 
It is my greatest pride, 
And in myliours of leisure 
To go toddling thro' the glide. 
0, give to me the outside sport, 
It is 80 gay and airy, 
For all the boys around the park 
They call me Boston Mary. 
CHORUS. 
With my tita Ia, oh, tita la ! 
Wherever I 
may go, 
I'm one that's fond of pleasure, 
Is Boston Mary, oh. 
With my tita la, my tita la ! 
Wherever I 
may lark, 
You bet I 
have the best costume 
Of any of the girls in the park. 
I 
have a 
charming sweetheart, 
And Joey. that's his name ; 
At summer time often on the lawn 
We play the croquet game. 
Oh, do I 
not admire it ? 
My chance I 
would not miss; 
Before my petty parts with me 
His darling he must kiss. 
With my tita la, etc. 
One evening, while out rambling— 
"Ewa; shortly alter dark— 
My Joe and I 
went meandering 
Up to Washington Park. 
While walking around the fountain 
We met with a 
parcel of loons. 
One asked me to pay a 
visit with him 
To one of the " tea-rooms." 
With my tita Ia, etc. 
Written by J. KENNY for JACK CONROY and J. 
O'l\TEm. 
I'm a 
man that's going to be married 
To a 
darling old daisy so fine; 
But I 
tell you me poor heart is worried, 
To think that I'm going to bind 
Myself to a 
woman forever, 
And cling to her while there's a 
spark. 
I 
was captured by her very clever, 
My Jane McInnarny from Cork. 
CHORUS. 
She's a 
lady they say to perfection, 
No matter what of her is said, 
There's not a 
girl in the creation, 
Before Jane McInnarny I'd wed. 
She has a 
nose like a 
rag picker's poker, 
Her mouth's like a 
great sucking pump, 
Her eyes are as big as two praties, 
And on her back there grows a 
hump. 
Her ears are as long as a 
rabbit's, 
Her teeth are the length of a 
fork, 
What ever she see's she will grab it, 
My Jane McInnarny from Cork. 
She's a 
lady, etc. 
Her feet are as big as a 
coal cart, 
Her fingers as long as a 
rake, 
Her tongue is so big that when it starts,. 
The half of the town it does shake. 
She has a 
voice like a 
great clap of thunder, 
She could eat up the half of New York, 
With her breath she could blow you asunder, 
My Jane McInuarny from Cork. 
She's a

WRESTLING JACK. 
Sung by JACK CONROY.

DE 
W ITT. 
On, when first I 
came to Araerikay, at my trade I 
worked 
hard every day, 
Until at last I 
found a 
chance my fortune for to gain ; 
Oh, sure I 
was told the greatest men at wrestling that 
e'er was seen, 
Lived beyant in Vermont near the state of Maine. 
So I 
throwed my working clothes away, and started off 
that very day, 
To see if the man was living that could take a 
fall from 
me, 
For I'm sure in the old country there was not a 
man 
could equal me, 
For I 
was known as the hero Wrestling Jack. 
CHORUS. 
For I've conquered Lane, McLoughlin, Owens and 
McMahon, 
Martin and Kennedy, sure I 
put Miller on his back; 
Oh, to me they were but boys, and I 
handled them like 
toys, 
And gained from them the title of the hero Wrestling 
Jack. 
Whilst in Vermont I 
wrestled ten, and better men there 
ne'er was seen, 
But I 
could throw them easy, so you bet your life on 
me.

W.USTLING JACK.— Concluded. 
But the hardest man I 
met of all, he stood six feet nine 
inches tall, 
He was called the bully, his name it was Tierney. 
Oh, I 
took him easy for awhile, until at last I 
got his 
style ; 
But he was a 
hard one and for strength he did not 
lack, 
But quicker than I 
could tell you, my friends, I 
had him 
conquered, too, 
Defeated like the rest. of them by the hero Wrestling 
Jack. 
I 
conquered Tallle, McLoughlin, etc. 
As to California next I 
went and in that place a 
year I 
spent, 
For I 
was told in the Golden State there I'd meet my 
match ; 
I 
met a 
man called Curchey, an able bodied Irish boy, 
I 
did not like to throw him, and I 
told him so. 
But wrestle me he said he would, and toss me, too, he 
swore he could. 
All right, says I, young man, but I'll make you take it 
back, 
For travel this world all in all there's not a 
man gave me 
a 
fall, 
Or took from me the title of the hero Wrestling Jack. 
For I've conquered Lane, McLoughlin, etc.

GRANDMOTHER'S CHAIR. 
As sung by JACK CONROY with immense success. 
The Music of this song will be sent to any address, post paid, on receipt 
of price, 10 cents. 
MY 
grandmother she at the age of eighty-three, 
One day in May was taken ill and died, 
And after she was dead, the will of course was read. 
By a 
lawyer as we all stood side by side. 
To my brother it was found, she had left a hundred 
pounds, 
The same unto my sister, I 
declare, 
But when it came to me, the lawyer said, " I 
see, 
She has left to you her old arm-chair." 
CHORCS. 
And how they tittered, how they chaffed, 
How my brother and sister laughed. 
When they heard the lawyer declare, 
Granny had only left to me her old arm chair. 
I 
thought it hardly fair, still I 
said I 
did not care, 
And in the evening took the chair away ; 
The neighbors they me chaffed, my 
laughed, 
And said it will be useful John some day.

GRANDMOTHER'S CHAIR .—Corieludoti. 
When you settle down in life, find some girl to be your 
wife, 
You'll find it very handy, I 
declare ; 
On a 
cold frosty night, when the fire is burning bright, 
You can sit in your old arm-chair. 
And how they tittered, etc. 
What my brother said was true, for in a 
year or two, 
Strange to say, I 
settled down in married life ; 
1 
first a 
girl did court, and then the ring I 
bought, 
Took her to church, and when she was my wife 
The old girl and me were as happy as could be, 
For when my work was over, I 
declare, 
I 
ne'er abroad would roam, but each night would stay at 
home, 
And be seated in my old arm- chair. 
And how they tittered, etc. 
One night the chair fell down, when I 
picked it up I 
found 
The seat had fallen out upon the floor ; 
And there to my surprise, I 
saw before my eyes, 
A 
lot of notes, two thousand pounds or more. 
When my brother heard of this, the fellow I 
confess, 
Went nearly mad with rage, alid tore his hair, 
But I 
only laughed at him, then said unto him, Jem, 
Don't you wish you had the old arm-chair ? 
And how they tittered, etc.

I 
DON'T LIKE A CUR AT MY HEELS. 
Words and Music by FRED BOLLARD. 
As sung by N ED BARRY, with great success. 
I 
LIKE honest pluck in this warfare of life, 
No matter whoever I 
meet ; 
I 
like a 
man boldly to say what he thinks, 
And not fill me with hollow deceit. 
It may not be pleasant at all times to hear 
The truth plainly told in your ear ; 
Yet ' tis better to know you're prepared for the worst, 
Than tremble like children, with fear. 
ciloRtis. 
I 
do like a 
man that will boldly stand up, 
And tell me at once what he feels; 
I 
can light with the lion that roars in my face, 
But I 
can't bear a 
cur at my heels. 
I 
like to be told of my faults like a 
man, 
And I 
ne'er knew the man, who had none; 
Hard words may be used, yet I 
like him the most 
Who has pluck all my faults to make known. 
if wrong, I 
can cure the foul slander at once, 
And destroy every venomous part ; 
Yet I 
reel when a 
Judas, who smiles in my face, 
Gives a 
stab at my back in the dark. 
I 
do like a 
man, etc. 
So, behind a 
man's back always mind what you say, 
if you can't do him no good, do him no harm ; 
If you don't like back-biting, don't do it yourself, 
And your good name will spread like a 
charm. 
We all have to live, so let's try and make life 
A 
good open field for the race, 
And if you have cause of complaint against man, 
Go tell him right straight to his face. 
I 
do like a 
man, etc.

WIDOW CLANCY'S PARTY. 
Written and sung by Js. O'NEIL and JACK CONROY. 
How are you's one and all ? sure we tho't we'd make a 
call 
And tell you all about the widow's party. 
'Twas at Pythogoras Hall we gave a 
break-down bidl, 
And invited all the young folks gay and hearty. 
There was handsome Paddy Grace, sure he's now on the 
police, 
He was put there by a 
political party; 
He came from county Cork to the city of New York, 
He joked and sang and made us laugh so hearty. 
CHORUS. 
Ah ! the charming Widow Clancy, • 
She was any man's fancy, 
She was a 
fluent talker and a 
rattling six day walker, 
And a 
Venus was the charming Widow Clancy. 
:\IeGinn sang Pinafore until his throat was sore, 
Smith sang the song called the " Little Dudeen," 
Crosby sang a 
ditty, the girls they called him witty, 
I 
never hardly ever heard before. 
Flinn sung Dancing on the Green and She's a 
Fairy Queen, 
Flood sang Hold the Fort for we're the strongest party, 
Murphy and Tim Lang done the Lackawanna Gang, 
Down at the charming Widow Clancy's-Party. 
Ah ! the charming, etc. 
We thought it was time to eat as it was growing late, 
We went in two by two's down to the supper, 
We were hardly seated right when there was a 
fearful fight, 
For McGinn swore the whiskey it was water. 
All around ' twas hand to hand, and they nearly killed the 
band; 
In stepped the boxer, Mike McCarty, 
He swore by all above that he'd put on the gloves 
And clean out every sucker in the party. 
Ah ! the charming, etc.

light weight of sixteen, 
Wid hair where warmest colors blaze,

A 
lump of carrot gold is she, 
This little Maggy Ann.

A 
Vaynus is she, whatever that may 
Is little Maggy Ann. 
She used to be a 
working-man, 
Down in a 
laundry fine, 
And wrestle wid discouraged shirts, 
Till wid new life they'd shine, 
But she behem high-tony, as 
Would any other man, 
And now a 
pure rule Irish nurse, 
Is little Muggy Ann. 
This little Muggy Ann, Or. 
The babies all she washes, 
And then irons them out well, 
And fetches them a 
lively slap, 
If out of tune they yell. 
A 
fancy night-cap then she wears, 
This French Hibernian, 
Then to the Park wid all the babes, 
Glides little Maggy Ann. 
This little Muggy Ann, etc.

COD LIVER OIL. 
thing with great suceesi by J. H. CONROY. 
I'M a 
poor married man, and wretched is my life; 
Six years I've been married to a 
very sick wife. 
From morning till night she does nothing but sigh, 
And the neighbors all said she was going to die. 
A 
young friend of mine called on me one day, 
And saw that my wife she was pining away; 
He very soon told me how she would get strong, 
By drinking an oil made by Doctor De John. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! Doctor De John, oh! Doctor De John, 
Your cod liver oil is so pure and so strong, 
I 
think on my life III be under the soil, 
If my wife keeps on drinking your cod liver oil. 
I 
bought her a 
bottle, which gave her delight, 
And soon the contents she put out of sight ; 
I 
bought her a 
dozen, which vanished the same, 
Till I 
thought she'd take cod liver oil on the brain. 
'Twas then that I 
noticed with wonder and doubt, 
My wife she was getting most wonderfully stout ;* 
And when she got stout, of course she got strong, 
'Till I 
own I 
was jealous of Doctor De John. 
Oh! Doctor De John, ete. 
We courted and cooed like two turtle doves, 
Vut lately my wife, she's brought home boxing gloves, 
And if I 
do not keep as quiet as a 
mouse, 
It's round after round I'm sent round the house.

COD LIVER OIL.—Concluded. 
'Twas only last night, the servant named Janes, 
Says " Master, your Misses has brought you home twins." 
For two more blessed babies I'll now have to toil, 
;Oh ! how I 
wish she'd stop drinking his cod liver oil. 
Oh! Doctor De John, etc. 
Jur own little Billy, he's getting so fat, 
All day like a 
porpoise he rolls on the mat, 
And even the cat has a 
new coat of silk, 
For my wife says that oil is much better than milk. 
I 
can't get a 
bit cooked, do just what I 
like, 
She's turned against cooking, and is gone on a 
strike, 
And even the kettle, when it begins for to boil, 
You'd swear it was singing out cod liver oil. 
Oh! Doctor De John, etc. 
Oh! Doctor De John, who taught you the art 
Of i'n aking cod liver, to break a 
man's heart ? 
For if she continues, you shortly will see, 
Your cod liver will make a 
short liver of me. 
My house it resembles a 
big doctor shop, 
It's filled with your bottles from bottom to top, 
And when my wife's dead, and she's under the soil, 
I'll write on her tombstone, " Here lies Cod Liver Oil." 
Oh! Doctor De John, etc. 
Written and sung by lic -sny CATtNEY, with marked success at Tony 
Pastor's Theatre, New York. 
You've all heard of the solid men, 
And men of great renown; 
But if you'll listen for awhile 
I'm certain you will own 
That I'm the most respected man 
In this great town ; and why? 
It is because when I 
walk out 
You will hear the people cry— 
enoncs. 
I'm Mr. Johnny Dougherty, the tailor, 
A man of great renown;. 
And everybody knows that to make a 
suit of clothes 
I'm the very best you'll find in all the town 
I've heard them say a 
tailor is 
The ninth part of a 
man; 
Let them get up and knock me 
Into nine parts if they can. 
Devil a 
one would ever dare 
To box me for a 
foe, 
For I 
can box as well as stitch, 
As very well they know. 
I'm Mr. Johnny Dougherty, etc.

I'VE a 
casket at home that is filled with precious gems ; 
I 
have pictures of friends dear to me, 
And I've trinkets so rare, that came many years ago, 
From my far distant home across the sea. 
But there's one sweet little treasure that I'll ever dearly 
prize, 
Better far than all the wealth beneath the wave ; 
Tho' a 
small faded flow'ret, that I 
placed in childhood's 
days. 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave, 
CHORUS. 
Treasured in my mem'ry like a 
happy dream, 
Are the loving words she g,tve, 
And my heart fondly cleaves to the dry and withered 
leaves— 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
In the quiet country churchyard they laid her down to 
sieep ; 
Close beside the old home she's at rest, 
And the low, sacred mound is enshrined within my heart, 
By the sweet ties of love forever blest. 
In the still and silent night I 
often dream of home again, 
And the vision ever tells me to be brave ; 
For the last link that binds me to the place I 
love so 
well, 
Is the flower from my angel mother's grave. 
Treasured in my memory, etc.

Parody on Pinafbro. 
Written by THOS. 0. DAVIS. 
Sung by KELLY. & RYAN, the famous 
" 
Bards of Tara." 
When I 
was a 
lad I 
served a 
term, 
As a 
latherer of mugs in a 
barbers' firm 
As a 
five cent barber I 
soon got sore, 
So I 
got drunk one night when I 
wrote " Pinafore." 
I 
wrote " Pinafore " so successfullee 
That it's sung by all the snides in the country. 
As a 
great composer, I 
made such a 
mark, 
They made me inspector of the tramps in the park.; 
So for fear small pox would destroy their ga.ul, 
I 
had them vaccinated with a 
cobbler awl. 
And by doing this job so " Komikally" 
They paid for nay ferry over to Jersey. 
Between writing and shating I 
made such a 
name, 
The Widow °livers lawyer I 
soon became; 
Then I 
gambled in a 
clothing store with an old galoot, 
That by turning five aces I 
won the suit. 
Oh, it fit me so quick and looked so seedy, 
That I 
sold it for a 
dollar in a 
hash foundry. 
By smoking old stumps I 
paralyzed my 
jaw, 
Then I 
went to rag.picking and a 
band- cart did draw ; 
I 
drawed so well and became so smart, 
I 
soon became the owner of a 
big ash-cart. 
Now, I 
bored you all to- night so frightfullee, 
I'd better rig my " Pinafore " and skip away to sea.

Written and sung by O'N EIL and CONROY only. 
THERE'S pa, his name is Romeo, 
And sister Terpsichore ; 
There's uncle William Fredrick Grey, 
And half a 
dozen more. 
They all have their titles of renown, 
Just like my Angeline, 
But none can boast a 
name like mine, 
Adolphus Charles Fitzgreen. 
CHORUS. 
Adolphus Charles Fitzgreen, 
His equal can't be seen, 
The girls repeat his name so sweet, 
As silently they gleam. 
He dances and he sings, 
And floats on Cupid's wings, 
He's quite a 
parlor ornament, 
Adolphus Charles Fitzgreen. 
He's quite a 
sociarcharacter, 
And sings just like a 
lark, 
He dances like a 
fairy queen 
At picnics in the park. 
In Summer time he plays croquet, 
In winter philipene, 
He dines on sugar plums and pies, 
Adolphus Charles Fitzgreen. 
Adolphus Charles, etc. 
Just now I 
have no time to stay, • 
My duty calls me hence,

For Adolphus Charles Fitzgreen.

THE HUNGRY •BOARDING HOUSE. 
Written by JAMES MeAvor for O'NEIL and CONROY. 
IN 
a 
Broadway house, across the street, 
Where all the hungry boarders eat, 
At noon they open wide their gash, 
To make short work of their soup and hash. 
At nine o'clock they slip out of bed, 
And fly down stairs for to be fed ; 
They clean the table as slick as a 
mouse 
In the hungry, starving boarding house. 
CHORUS. 
Nobody knows what the boarders eat— 
Pass no remarks about the meat— 
Just keep mum and close your mouth 
In the hungry, starving boarding house. 
The cooks they sleep on the second floor, 
With a 
padlock hitched on every door, 
So the hungry boarders can't get in. 
Where was Moses when they deuced the glim ? 
They make them sleep up in the attic, 
And all night long they kick up a 
racket ; 
They give the chambermaid the run, 
And chased her out with a 
Gatling gun. 
Nobody knows, etc. 
A 
week ago a 
boarder skipped, 
Faith, out of the window he fired his grip ; 
He lowered his trunk down with a 
rope, 
And then for a 
freight train he did slope ; 
Next morning when they called the roll 
The landlord blessed his darling soul; 
His daughter she squealed out, " Oh laws! 
He's given us the finger for three weeks' board."

OH 
! 
it's two bad men we are, 
From the west we come afar, 
And we beat our way right here upon the train. 
But when they found us there, 
They put us off with care, 
And went in search of the conductaire. 
CHORUS. 
With our bowie knives in belt, 
Our presence may be felt 
By the odor of the crime that from us shoots. 
Of us two it may be sung, 
That if we should not be hung, 
You can bet we'll both die game in our boots. 
With our, etc.—(Dance.) 
When we stop a 
traveller, 
We most expeditious are, 
If they don't give up, we simply cut their throats ; 
We of pistols have a 
score 
And knives as many more, 
Which we carry in our pantaloons and boots. 
With our bowie knives, etc. 
Yes, we are two dreadful scamps, 
But you mustn't call us tramps, 
For the walking is so bad it never suits, 
And besides we'd have no peace, 
For we should meet the police, 
Who would quickly shoot us prowlers in our boots. 
With our bowie knives, etc.

MeCAFFREY'S OLD HORSE. 
Written and sung with great success by J. H . 
CONROT. 
I'm going to sing you a 
ditty, 
I'm sure it will cause you to smile ; 
It's about an old horse in the city, 
That sticks out his tail in grand style ; 
Although the poor creature looks lazy, 
Not a 
horse in the land, I'll go bail, 
Could travel so quick and so easy, 
Providing he got a 
square meal. 
• SPOKEN. — I 
stabled the old horse in the rear of a 
tene-
ment house in. Mulberry street, and the alley going 
through was so narrow that I 
would wear the shoulder-
blades of my coat off when I 
would be going to the 
stable. 
The old horse could go through on a 
trot. 
The 
gang played a 
trick on me one fine morning. 
They fat-
tened him up, :Ind I 
could not get him out of the stable. 
I 
was compelled to knock the roof off and hoist him out 
with a 
derrick into Callahan's yard next door me. 
I 
picked him up and carried him out through the hallway, 
put the harness on him, and he lay down on me ; and I've 
heard of men being beastly drunk, but the horse was 
as drunk as a 
human being. 
But I 
tell you— 
CHORES. 
He was a 
horse that could travel, 
Providing you kept him well fed ; 
He could trot upon stones or on gravel, 
And make other horses in dread. 
Some say the horse was short-winded, 
Some say he got nothing to eat ; 
11.Yre say he was high-minded, 
And that he was full of conceit. 
McCAFFREY'S OLD HORSE.—Concluded. 
But while the poor horse was living, 
He eat many bundles of hay ; 
But now that he's dead we'll forgive him, 
For a 
horse like a 
dog has his day. 
SPOKEN. —I 
was coming from the Fulton Market, and 
when I 
reached the corner of Woliver and Warrick street, 
a 
fire engine came around on a 
quick turn, and being in 
the neighborhood, the pole hit me and knocketrme into 
an ash barrel. 
I 
was mad enough to put a 
head on the 
barrel, but I 
did not. 
I 
left the horse and wagon and ran 
down to the fire, thinking it was my own little home was 
blazing. 
When I 
reached the fire the men had a 
rubber 
sheet spread out. 
Says I, 
" 
Gentlemen, what's this for ?" 
They said, " To catch little boys and girls." " I'll give 
you a 
hand," and I 
took hold of the sheet. 
They com-
menced throwing looking-glasses and bustles out. 
I, 
getting dry, thought I'd go and get a 
drink. 
I 
had not 
reached ten paces when the hose busted and I 
was wet 
through. 
I 
went back where the firemen were, and they 
commenced laughing at me. " What are you giggling 
at ?" says I. " Oh, nothing, only you are not as dry as 
you were." " No," says I, " and I'll not take so much 
fire water when I 
go for another drink." 
I 
heard a 
girl 
cry for help. 
I 
rushed up to save her. 
I 
had her in 
my arms, and \vac coming down stairs, when the stairs 
fell in. 
The devil up or down we could get. 
But the 
presence of mind struck me in the small of the back 
about a 
man wrecked at sea, and washed himself ashore 
with a 
piece of soap. 
I 
went into her chamber, got a 
piece of soap, spit on my hands, made a 
lather, and we 
both climbed down safe. 
Then I 
went to look fifter my 
wagon. 
The boys had my horse divided among them. 
But many a 
time in speaking to my friends, I 
would 
say. 
He was the horse, etc.

To drive away starvation from
