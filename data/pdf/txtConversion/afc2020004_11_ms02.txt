Duane Niatum:  This is Duane Niatum reading “Old Humptulips” for my grandfather, 
Francis Patsey. 
 
[Duane Niatum reads “Old Humptulips”] 
 
DN:  Commentary on “Old Humptulips.” I chose this poem about my Grandpa because 
he told me this wonderful story about what happened when the Klallams were run out 
of their villages and land by the new local governments in the nineteenth century, to 
allow white settlers to come and occupy their land. The government officials had guards 
pack up and send off the Klallams to the Swinomish Nation across the Salish Sea. The 
idea was to start a fight between the two tribal nations. But the Klallam families still had 
their canoes and supplies and one night, under cover of darkness when no one was 
looking, they headed back home to Klallam country, where their people had lived for 
thousands of years.  
 
Eventually the families pooled what money they had and bought the land that had been 
stolen by the whites. It was a small part of what was originally their home base, but it 
gave them the chance to start a new life from the pain of displacement. The irony is 
terrific because the Klallams of today have been far more financially successful than the 
white people of the Sequim area. The Jamestown S’Klallam Seven Cedars Casino 
generates more revenue for the region than the entire local white business community. 
This revenue allows the Jamestown Klallam Nation to provide health care, dental and 
other services to the tribe and the community at large. 
 
My grandfather, if he were still alive, would get a happy chuckle from this turn of 
fortunes. My grandfather taught me to value the land, along with the sea, the 
community of people and creatures that we live with.
