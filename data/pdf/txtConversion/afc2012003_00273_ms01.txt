About Donna Moos… 
 
Donna Moos, born in Louisiana in 1965, became a member of the circus community in 1975 
when her father “joined” the Carson and Barnes Circus to run the cookhouse. At the time her 
father went to work for the circus, the family was living in Paris, Texas where he worked for 
the health department. When she was ten Donna started working in the show, participating 
in the spec, performing the web, and riding elephants. She was a showgirl until she was 
twenty-four years old. In 1990 while trouping with the Great American Circus, she 
performed her first solo trapeze act and the following year she performed the cloud swing. 
After meeting Rob, her long term boyfriend, she left the circus and lived in North Carolina 
where she became a hairdresser and later went into banking.  
 
In 2008 Donna and Rob relocated to Hugo, Oklahoma where Donna now is the office 
assistant for the Culpepper and Merriweather Circus. Having been in the circus, Donna 
understands “the show must go on” and continues to enjoy life in the Hugo circus 
community.

Today is August 11, 2011. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with 
Juliana Nykolaiszyn. We’re with the Oklahoma Oral History Research 
Program at the OSU Library, and today we’re in Hugo, Oklahoma, to 
discuss the circus community with Donna Moos. Thank you for having 
us in your home. 
 
You’re welcome. Thanks for coming. 
 
Let’s start by having you tell us a little bit about yourself, where you 
were born, a little bit about your youth, and then we’ll work our way 
forward.  
 
All right. I was born in Shreveport, Louisiana, and when I was like two, 
our family moved to Longview, Texas. Then from Longview we moved 
to Nacogdoches, and then we ended up in Paris, Texas, which is about 
thirty minutes from Hugo. My dad was working at the health department 
in Paris. My sisters and I were in grade school, and my mother was 
working at a truck stop. My dad, when I was nine years old, he came 
home one day and said we were joining the circus. And I said, “Are you 
crazy? Do you know what those people are like?” So we joined the 
circus from there, and the people are great. It was the best place to be 
raised. I spent, with my family, six seasons on Carson and Barnes. We 
started in 1975 and I had, I couldn’t tell you how many mothers. If 
anybody saw me doing anything, I would get in trouble. They would tell 
my mother. I would get in trouble again so it was just the best place to 
grow up. 
 
I’m assuming you graduated from high school in Paris. 
 
No, long story. My uncle had been a prisoner of war (POW) in World 
War II, and when he was in the POW camp in Germany, he read

Thomas Wolfe’s Look Homeward, Angel. I believe Thomas Wolfe had 
gone to the University of North Carolina so my uncle eventually moved 
to North Carolina. We wanted to spend our winters close to them so we 
bought a place in North Carolina, just some land. In 1980—1980 was 
our last season with the circus—homeschooling wasn’t recognized back 
then. A few weeks before graduation, they told my older sister that she 
couldn’t graduate because she didn’t have enough hours. We ended up 
living with friends and family so she could at least finish school, but she 
had to get her GED. Then my parents were going to get off the road until 
my younger sister graduated. My mother passed away two weeks before 
my sister graduated so my dad never made it back on the road.  
 
I did graduate from high school in North Carolina and then went back 
with different shows for a few months here, a few months there. I kept 
going back to North Carolina, back to different circuses. Then in 1993, I 
was on Great American Circus, and I met Rob, and we ended up in 
North Carolina. We were going to take a year off, but he started doing 
construction and it was booming so that year turned into fifteen years. 
We stayed in North Carolina, and I went to beauty school, was a 
hairdresser, and then I got into banking. I was doing that until 2008 
when I got a call. Carson and Barnes needed some help in their office in 
Hugo so we ended up in Hugo. Rob’s originally from Texas so he’s a lot 
closer to his family than he was. He loves Oklahoma. He won’t admit it 
out loud, because he’s a Texan. That’s it in a nutshell.  
 
So what high school in North Carolina? 
 
It was Northwood High School in Pittsboro, North Carolina, about 
twenty miles from Chapel Hill and about thirty miles from Raleigh, 
small town like Hugo.  
 
Do you know what prompted your father to want to join the circus? 
 
Sort of, kind of. When he was a kid, Ringling Brothers would come 
through Shreveport or close by, and this is when they were under a tent. 
I don’t know if he was one of the boys that helped set up, because back 
then they would let town boys help set up in certain ways, but he 
certainly would go watch them set up and watch the show. My mother 
was from Connecticut, and she went down to New Orleans for Mardi 
Gras and never went back home. I don’t know how she ended up in 
Shreveport, but she was involved in little theater, some in the performing 
arts. I guess they had seen a magazine, this was when we were living in 
Paris, about Clyde Beatty-Cole Brothers Circus and thought that was 
interesting.  
 
The story goes that my dad had seen ads over the years that Carson and

Moos

Barnes was looking for a cook, and he had owned his own restaurant in 
Longview, and he’s a great cook. He was working at the health 
department in Paris, would see the ads, and he would come up right after 
he got off work and talk to D.R. Miller. D.R. would see him in a tie and 
a suit and, “This guy isn’t going to make it. This guy won’t—he can’t do 
it,” because it is physical, hard labor. Plus, my dad was in his forties, no 
circus background. So finally, after a few years, D.R. relented and my 
dad got the job as the cook. He actually ran the cookhouse and the pie 
car with my mother. He managed both, and like I said, they did it from 
’75 through ’80, and they loved it. 
 
So you traveled with them. Did you have an act in the show or what 
were you doing? 
 
No. Originally, I was nine, and I was just a pest. I got in everybody’s 
way, but nine years old, you’re watching these girls that look like Miss 
America, and they’re twirling and spinning and the costumes are 
beautiful. So I wanted to do that, and we would—me and the other kids, 
and there were a lot of kids on Carson and Barnes—we would kind of 
play around. Now, some of them were from circus families so they took 
practice seriously, and they were practicing from the time they were 
three so I got a late start at nine.  
 
I was thinking about it a few months ago, eventually, my last turn with 
one of the circuses I had my own trapeze act. I had another act called the 
cloud swing, an aerial act, and I never would have had those if Lucy 
[Loyal] hadn’t let us play on her trapeze. She didn’t stand there and 
teach us, she would just lower it down so we wouldn’t kill ourselves. It 
was play, but we were learning when we played. Then when I was ten I 
actually started working in the show. I had to wear a Marilyn Monroe 
wig so I wouldn’t look ten, because I was working with the other show 
girls that were in their late teens, early twenties. I did spec and did web 
and rode the elephants.  
 
Describe some of your costumes. 
 
Oh, my gosh! The ones that Carson and Barnes made—I don’t know if 
you’ve heard the stories. Carson and Barnes, D.R. and Isla [Miller] and 
Barbara and Geary [Byrd] and the kids—this was back in 1975, the late 
’70s—they all lived in the Big House. It’s still in Hugo on Kirk Road, 
and the whole basement was used for nothing but sewing. When the 
circus was closed for the winter, they would start the costumes for the 
next season. They would make costumes for eighteen or twenty web 
girls. They had two elephant acts, one with five girls, another with about 
seven or ten girls, the jackets for the elephant handlers, the blankets for 
the elephants. They had thirty elephants at the time, and they would do

this during the winter, and they made the most beautiful costumes in that 
basement. Barbara Byrd would design them. Barbara Fulton, her cousin, 
would design them as well and help sew on them. Everybody would help 
sew. I was nine and ten. I was sewing. My mom said, “If you’re here, 
you have to work.” I learned a good work ethic at the same time I 
learned how to sew.  
 
Then when I got my own act, I had to make costumes for myself. Well, I 
had never sewn two pieces of material together. All I had ever done was 
decorate the way they told me to decorate something. So I figured out 
how to sew my own costumes and I loved it! In fact, when we were in 
North Carolina, I said, “Wow, I really miss making the costumes with 
rhinestones and sequins so I had Rob take me to a gentleman’s club. I 
thought, “I could make some costumes for the girls that work there.” But 
everything they had, they didn’t have one sequin, no rhinestones, 
anything. They didn’t care to have anything decorated, so I didn’t get to 
decorate any costumes. (Laughter) But, yes, I missed it.  
 
If you started working that early, did you get paid, or an allowance or 
something, for your effort? 
 
Yes, I mean, I got paid. And for a kid at nine or ten or whatever, it was 
probably a lot of money. It was fourteen dollars a week. When I lived 
with my parents and I had my chores in Paris, I got twenty-five cents a 
week so I thought I was rich. Looking back, I worked just as hard as the 
adults did, and I’m sure they were making more, but everything is 
relative.  
 
Did your mother do an act or was she primarily cooking? 
 
She did the cookhouse and the pie car. She ran the pie car while Daddy 
was getting lunch ready. She would go do the shopping for the 
cookhouse and pie car. She would go to the post office every day and get 
all the mail for the show, and then she would help my dad serve dinner 
in the cookhouse. Daddy was the first one up and the last one to bed 
every day. He got up and made coffee for the guys before they moved to 
the next town—or for the whole show before they traveled to the next 
town—and he would give them coffee and rolls or donuts that they 
could eat on the road, and he cooked two meals. The pie car was snacks, 
sandwiches, burgers, and it stayed open from the time it got on the lot 
until the tent was torn down and the last person had what they wanted in 
the pie car. Then he would shut down the pie car generator and go to 
bed. And he would take a nap during the day. He had good assistants, 
and I’ve heard so many people just comment on how good the 
cookhouse and pie car were. So I’m real proud of that, and he is too.

Was it all he expected it to be?  
 
It’s funny because my dad is a very quiet man. He’s got a sense of 
humor, but he’s real quiet. He just sits back and watches and appreciates 
everybody else. He has always been one that whatever it takes to get a 
job done, he’s never called in sick. I think it was more than he thought, 
but he really enjoyed it. He would probably sit there and listen to stories 
people didn’t know he was listening to, but he enjoyed it or he wouldn’t 
have done it for six years. The only reason they got off the road is 
because it was costing too much to send us back and forth to school 
every year. They had every intention of going back out on the road, and 
I guess it was they were going to go back—I don’t know—when my 
sister graduated, whenever that was, and that just didn’t work out.  
 
Describe your living quarters while you were on the road. 
 
Well, they varied. When I lived with my family, there were five of us in 
a twenty-five foot travel trailer. And you have to understand, my dad is 
practical to a fault, and I am too. Five of us in a travel trailer, I had a bed 
in the back, my older sister had a bed in the back, the couch in the front 
folded out to make a double bed, so my mom and my little sister slept 
there. Since storage was at a premium, there was a bed that would fold 
down, but we needed that space for storage. So my dad had a little 
mattress that he would just put on the floor, since he was the last one in 
bed and the first one up every morning, he’d just put it on the floor in the 
hallway in the trailer and sleep there. My grandmother joined us when 
she was seventy-seven in 1977 so that added one more person. I would 
just sleep in the back of the station wagon at night, which was great 
because it was like having my own room. I could listen to the radio.  I 
didn’t have to get up at five to go out to the car. All I had to do was just 
pull my feet up so they could fold the back seat up, and then I’d just go 
right back to sleep so it was great. It was great.  
 
Every now and then, I think his biggest peeve was we’d run out of 
water. The water truck would fill the trailers up once a day. And I was a 
pre-teen at that time and didn’t want to just use my five gallons of water. 
I think the water heater was four gallons so I would end up using not 
only all the hot water, but all the water, period, and that was a bone of 
contention. Then when I was seventeen, I came out on Carson and 
Barnes by myself, in the summers without my family. So at that point, I 
lived in one of the sleepers that they have for the single people. And it’s 
basically a bed, a single bed, a place about this wide (motions) to hang 
your clothes, that tall, just as deep, and two shelves underneath, and that 
was pretty much it. They were called sweat boxes. They looked like 
sweat boxes, but it was home to me.

The summers weren’t too bad because we were usually up north, and I 
guess as a kid, you can adapt to anything, too. I couldn’t do it now. 
There’s no way, but it was great in the summers. I would go to the water 
truck and fill up my five gallon bucket of water. When it came time to 
take a shower, I’d put on my bathing suit and stand out by my bucket 
and take my shower with five gallons of water. My dad would be proud. 
(Laughs) But again, it’s just what you’re used to, and it was an 
adventure, and I was with people I knew, and I just had a great time. I 
did that for two summers. 
 
What was your act for those two summers? 
 
I was still a show girl. I was a show girl until I was twenty-four. I got my 
first act of my own when I was on Great American, which was 1990. 
 
And what was that? 
 
That was the trapeze, and then the next year I did the cloud swing.  
 
And who taught you how to do those? I know you watched—or you 
taught yourself? 
 
Pretty much, yes. Like I said, Lucy [Loyal] would let us play on her 
trapeze and just watching her and seeing what she did. I don’t know how 
I learned the cloud swing, because I had never seen it. 
 
I’m not entirely sure what that is. Can you describe it? 
 
It’s just a rope that’s shaped like a U, and it’s got two loops. They have 
ones with loops and without. I did the ones with loops, two loops 
hanging down. You swing back and forth, and you do tricks in and out 
of these loops with your hands in the loops or your feet in the loops or 
one hand and one foot or whatever. I had never seen it. I don’t know 
how I did it. I know that because I was self-taught, some of my timing 
was off and later on, people would try to get me to correct my timing. I 
had learned it wrong to begin with so I could never learn it the right 
way, but it worked for me. 
 
Was there a safety net under? 
 
No. I felt safe because I was in the loops. The only way you’re going 
anywhere is if the whole thing comes down—which has happened, but 
not ever when I was on it. 
 
Did you have any injuries while you were doing any of your 
performances?

No. I can’t walk on level ground, but I can do anything in the air.  
 
Would you do the same routine every night or did you just kind of 
improvise? 
 
It was the same routine every night. In fact, I don’t know if you watch 
America’s Got Talent, but these trapeze people that come on or the 
people that do circus-type acts, and Howie Mandel says, “Oh, well, 
show me something more.” And my trapeze act was the exact same 
routine for two years. (Laughs) There’s only so much you can do, your 
body can do so much, and, “Set your body on fire. It’ll be exciting. It’s 
not exciting that you’re flipping around, no net.” So anyway… 
 
Did you get to choose your own music to perform by? 
 
When I was on Great American, I did. As a show girl, I was a show girl 
on Carson and Barnes and on Kelly Miller and on Roberts Brothers. 
There was a great guy who did the music for Great American, and it was 
computerized music but it sounded really high quality. I told him what I 
wanted, and he put it together for me, for the trapezes, Phantom of the 
Opera. For the cloud swing, I think it was Arthur, the theme from 
Arthur. But anyways, it sounded good. It worked.  
 
So after twenty-one, I’m getting a little confused with the time. 
 
Because I went back and forth, town life, circus life, town life, circus 
life, and yes. 
 
Well, at what point did you make the transition from working in the 
show to working more behind the scenes? 
 
After I had been off the road for fifteen years, and I had put on seventy 
pounds. I had been in banking for twelve years, and I found I really like 
working at a desk. Now, I have the best of both worlds because the show 
must go on. Well, it’s still that for me. Even though I work in the office, 
the show must go on. My part goes from eight in the morning until five 
o’clock Monday through Friday. I do everything I can to make sure the 
show goes on, during those time frames. If you’re traveling with the 
show, it’s twenty-four/seven. Our first year on Carson and Barnes, the 
tent blew down, and everybody was out there sewing on it, kids that 
were four and five years old, sewing on the tent. I was sewing on the 
tent. Lucy’s father was in his seventies. Well, he sewed on the tent every 
day anyway. No matter what, he just patched it, repaired it, but 
everybody just did whatever. If the tent was late getting up, the kids 
would help set up the seats. Women, children, everybody would pitch in

and do whatever was needed so the show could start on time. 
 
Take us through a typical day on what you’re doing now. 
 
On my work now? It’s probably like your typical day. It’s a typical 
office day, just the calls are different. I get to work at eight something or 
other. (Laughs) I get coffee for the girl I work with and myself so as 
long as I’m at McDonald’s at eight o’clock, I’m on time. Our big job is 
to get the sponsors what they need so they can promote the circus. 
Culpepper and Merriweather relies heavily on local sponsors, such as the 
Lion’s Club, the Kiwanis Club, whomever. And a lot of them—and I’m 
so proud to be part of Culpepper and Merriweather—a lot of these 
sponsors call Trey [Key] and say, “When are you coming back? We’re 
ready to have the circus again.” A lot of them have done it year after 
year. 
 
This was my first year working with Culpepper, and I know the basics 
about circus, but each circus is run differently. You can’t assume just 
because this one does it this way that this one does it this way. I wanted 
to make sure I was doing things the way Trey wanted so the sponsors 
talked me through a lot of stuff. “Yes, we’ve done this for five years 
now,” or however many years.  
 
For the new ones, we make sure they have a booklet that tells them step-
by-step what they need to do. We make sure they get their tickets that 
they can sell in advance. We make sure they get their posters, their 
newspaper advertising, and help them with anything that we can. 
Sometimes they’ll have problems with permits, and we’ll help answer 
questions about information they need for their permits. But this is 
just—knock on wood or God bless Trey—but this has just been great. 
This is the first time in fifteen years I have had a job that is stress free. 
Okay? 
 
Hence, we smile. (Laughs) 
 
I love my job. 
 
What was your favorite part of performing? 
 
I liked it all. It didn’t feel like work. Even when I had my own acts, even 
more so, then, I did have to go set up my own rigging every day. They 
had prop guys that would do the hard, heavy physical stuff, but I had to 
make sure that everything was tied off the way it was supposed to be, 
everything was as level as could be. So I was there setting up in the 
morning. That was hard work in the literal sense, but I loved it. I wasn’t 
keen on the driving, getting up at five o’clock and driving every day.

That’s what I disliked most, but then putting on my makeup—I don’t 
wear a stitch of makeup now, but I loved getting glammed up, false 
eyelashes, making my costumes. Making them didn’t feel like work. It 
was fun, it was creative. If there were three people in the audience or 
three thousand, I loved performing. I just loved doing my act. It was 
exercise, but it didn’t feel like exercise. I think that’s why I’ve gained so 
much weight now, because I’ve never learned how to exercise for the 
sake of exercise. I always just got so much exercise doing what needed 
to be done.  
 
Speaking of the audience, would you make eye contact with them? 
 
Yes, it’s kind of hard not to. They’re sitting there staring at you, and you 
notice certain features about certain people. On Carson and Barnes it 
was harder because the audience was so much bigger, but on the smaller 
shows you would see somebody, “Wow, she’s really pretty,” or, “He’s 
really handsome,” or, “Oh, he’s Quasimodo.” But people—even in a 
crowd, somebody sticks out. 
 
Do you remember smells and that type of thing? 
 
Oh, yes. Oh, yes. In fact, you forget the smells while you’re there, but 
when you’re away for a long time, the first thing that comes back is the 
smells. One of my favorite smells, I love the smell of horses, but 
elephant manure. It’s pungent. Most people think it stinks, but it’s what I 
grew up with, and so it’s got a comforting feeling to me. 
 
Well, as you traveled from A to B, how would you do your laundry and 
simple things like that? 
 
And again, like I said, everybody worked, even the kids. When I was 
with my family, my mother didn’t have time for that because she had to 
do all the stuff for the show. My little sister was literally too young to do 
anything. My mother would drop me off at the Laundromat with all the 
laundry for the family, and I would do that while she was doing the 
buying for the cookhouse and pie car. And then she would come and 
pick me up and bring me back home. My older sister would help set up 
the cookhouse tent and all the tables and bleachers, or seats, for the 
employees to sit on so she couldn’t go do the laundry. It was up to me. I 
was the only one that could do it. I guess for people who don’t grow up 
that way, they see it as, “Oh, that’s a horrible life for a kid,” but I loved 
it, and it has made me such a better adult because of it. I never felt 
abused. I felt like I was contributing. We had fun, too. We would—oh, 
my goodness—play next to parks and fairs, and so we had time for fun, 
too, but we learned how to balance the two.

Were there rules as a young kid on the lot? 
 
Yes. That’s not to say I always followed them. I was pretty much a 
Goody Two-shoes, but the biggest one was the kids were supposed to 
stay off the midway, which was the entrance going into the tent. You’re 
supposed to stay off the midway and out of the tent unless you’re 
working on the midway or in the tent. Of course, I was bored. I wasn’t 
working yet so I wanted to go watch the sideshow or I wanted to go ride 
the elephant or wanted to run through the tent. We did. Kids are kids. 
And I’d get yelled at about it, and, “Oh, okay, sorry,” and then I’d do it 
again the next day, like kids do. 
 
When your mother was setting up the cookhouse tables and stuff, did 
certain people have to sit certain places? Were there any rules for that 
situation? 
 
Not because of a caste system, but, for instance, on Carson and Barnes 
especially, cookhouse was between shows, and on Saturdays we had 
matinees back to back. So some of the performers would have to come 
in their wardrobe. Some of the elephant men would come in their 
elephant clothes. You didn’t want the performers sitting where the 
elephant men had just sat so it was for that reason. Now, if a performer 
wanted to go sit with the elephant guys or with the big top guys, they 
could, but the elephant guys or the animal guys or the big top guys 
couldn’t go sit where the performers sat.  
 
As an adult now on the show, are there certain rules and are you getting 
fined for anything or no? Not so much. 
 
Well, no, I don’t… When I was a kid, my sister was the head usher. The 
show girls would usher before the show or sold coloring books or 
novelties or something. I ushered. My sister was the head usher. She 
would fine my pay every week just because she could.  
 
Well, that’s nice of her. (Laughs) 
 
Did she stay in show business? 
 
No, she’s a police officer now.  
 
Wow! 
 
She’s the one that they would not let graduate from high school so she 
took her GED, and then she went to the University of Greensboro and 
got a degree in English and then joined the police force right after that, 
and she’s been doing that. She was in the National Guard for a while.

She’s still doing fines, then. 
 
Yes! (Laughter) I’ll have to tell her you said that. Yes! I have told Rob, 
because we would have to drive through Greensboro to get from point A 
to point B sometimes, and I would tell him, I said, “You drive, because 
if she sees me, she’ll pull me over and give me a ticket just because she 
can.”  
 
Let’s talk a little bit about the work environment for the whole circus 
itself. When you were, as a family and then when you were single, 
working, too, was it much different? 
 
It is, and every show is different, too, the dynamics of every show. If 
you talk to anybody today that was on Carson and Barnes back between 
’75 and ’80 or back when I was on the show, it was the best. It was so 
much fun. Yes, we worked hard. We had muddy days, we had hot days, 
but everybody got along, for the most part. There were some people that 
irritated you no end, just like family, but it was great to work for. I liked 
working for Kelly Miller. I started with Kelly Miller when I was 
eighteen so I was more of an adult and expected to be more of an adult. I 
helped in the office a little bit on Kelly Miller. And then on Roberts 
Brothers, it was a very small show so it was very quiet compared to 
Carson and Barnes. Carson and Barnes was big, had a lot of employees. 
There was always something going on, parties or people just visiting or a 
lot of practicing on the flying trapeze. 
 
Great American was a medium-sized show, but everybody got along. 
For the most part, for a show that size, it was very quiet and easy going. 
You might have a confrontation with one of your neighbors. I mean, 
who’s not going to in nine months? But for the most part, everybody 
helps everybody out. And I liken it to MASH, if you watch MASH, 
people get on your nerves like Hot Lips and Frank, but when you have 
to, everybody pulls together. The environment’s real similar. You live 
every day with these people. It’s not like you go and see them for eight 
hours. What I find really funny now is my friend Robin, who I met on 
Carson and Barnes, we’ve known each other since we were fourteen, I 
guess. She’s on Culpepper now, and she loves to Facebook. She’ll 
Facebook to people that are parked right next to her. She’s going to see 
them in five minutes, and she’ll send them a Facebook message. That 
just kills me, but it’s fun. (Laughs) 
 
So back in the early days you worked with D.R. Miller, or worked for 
him? 
 
I did. I guess I worked mostly for Barbara [Miller Byrd]. She was in

charge of the show girls. My dad and mother worked for D.R., and he 
was a shrewd businessman. He had a temper, but you really had to mess 
up for him to show his temper. He was very generous, too, very 
generous. I think that’s one reason people liked—he ran the show 
differently than Barbara and Geary do. I think he was a little stricter, but 
people liked that. Barbara and Geary tend to be a little more complacent, 
and I guess people don’t really know what to do or who’s the boss. It’s 
not as structured as it was then. We had a lot of fun, but it was still 
structured, and you had to work and earn your place. 
 
Was the Great American based in Hugo, too—out of Hugo—or winter 
quartered here? 
 
No. Great American winter quartered in Florida. Roberts Brothers winter 
quartered in Florida.  
 
How would you learn about these in order to work for them? How would 
you find the job? 
 
All through boyfriends. (Laughs) The summer I went out on Carson and 
Barnes by myself, I met a guy, and we became boyfriend and girlfriend. 
He worked for David Rawls in the concession stand on Carson and 
Barnes. The following year when they took out Kelly Miller, the new 
Kelly Miller, David was the road manager, and a partner, and his wife 
Carol at the time. My boyfriend, at the time, went to work for David to 
be his boss canvasman. When I finished school that summer, I went out 
on Kelly Miller for the summer to be with him. Then things didn’t work 
out, and I ended up at home for a while.  
 
This was while my mother was sick and dying so God has a way of 
looking out for us, because I was where I needed to be when I needed to 
be there. My dad couldn’t take time off work to take her to appointments 
so I was home. I could do it. It worked out, and she passed away in May. 
Then I got a call from my friend, Robin, a few weeks later. She was on 
Roberts Brothers with her husband. She was pregnant, and she was 
getting too big to do the cradle act with him, ‘Could I come out and 
finish the season with them?’ So I did, and I met the ringmaster at the 
time, and so we moved in. Then the next year he went to Great 
American so I went with him to Great American. Then I met Rob on 
Great American, and that’s where we were going to take the year off in 
North Carolina, and it turned into fifteen or so.  
 
Well, when you started going out as a young adult, was there somebody 
on the lot that looked after the women, the single women? 
 
Yes, pretty much. Not to be cocky or prudish, but there were some

women that just didn’t want to be looked after, if you know what I 
mean. And there was me, I’m not a Goody Two-shoes, I’m not perfect, 
but they did kind of keep me under their wing, kind of watch out for me, 
kind of chaperone. And then when I got into my early twenties, it was, 
“Okay, you’re old enough to make your own decisions now,” but it, too, 
was a different group of people. People on Carson and Barnes had 
known me since I was a kid and probably still saw me as a kid.  
 
As you’re developing your acts and moving on in your career in the 
circus, did you have any circus mentors? 
 
Lucy [Loyal] would be my biggest one. When I was finally doing my 
trapeze act—I cannot remember who sold me my trapeze rigging. I can’t 
remember. I think I got it from Chris Schreiber, and then Ramon España, 
who I had met for the first time on Roberts Brothers. He was on Great 
American with us as well, and he’s the one who tried to help me with 
my timing. The funny thing is, he never did trapeze but his brothers and 
sisters did, and he knew just from watching them what the timing should 
be. I could re-learn a few things, but for the most part, I had just taught 
myself wrong and it worked for me. Plus, too, I’m so long. Some of the 
tricks I do, I just look like… (gestures). But I would have to say Lucy 
and Ramon were the biggest help, and then learning how to decorate the 
costumes on Carson and Barnes with Barbara Byrd and Barbara Fulton 
and Isla [Miller]. I had an appreciation for nice costumes. I have seen 
some people that maybe have one sequin and they’re done. I don’t like 
Cirque de Soleil because they don’t use sequins or rhinestones. I’m 
paying forty dollars for the worst seat in the house, and you can’t afford 
sequins and rhinestones? 
 
When was the last time you went to a circus? 
 
Culpepper and Merriweather. They opened at Bokchito on March 20, I 
think, and that was the last circus I saw. 
 
So you try to go to one or two a season? 
 
Yes, just if they’re close enough. It’s really funny, and I tell the sponsors 
this for Culpepper, too—you see so many circuses, and you know 
somebody on every show, you tend to get jaded, burned out, you’ve seen 
it before. And when I went to see Culpepper, even though I knew a lot of 
the people there, their show was so strong I sat and watched the show. 
And I’m not just saying that because I work for them now. It really was. 
Usually, I’ll go to a circus to visit my friends, not really to see the show. 
The last circus I paid for was Ringling Brothers about five or six years 
ago, and it was horrible. I thought, “I’m saying that because I’m from a 
circus background,” but my friend who had never worked for a circus

said the same thing. She was very disappointed. 
 
Can you recall your first circus memory, your earliest circus memory? 
 
Actually, my first circus memory isn’t in a circus I worked with. A few 
years before we joined Carson and Barnes, two or three, not many, my 
dad took us to see a Shrine circus somewhere, and I remember it was 
outdoors in a stadium. They didn’t have any cover. We went to the 
evening show so it wasn’t too bright or sunny. There was a fire truck 
that they would let kids ride on, and I busted my head on the bar that 
goes across the back of the fire truck. I remember being impressed with 
the show. I don’t remember the acts and to this day, I wonder if those are 
people that I knew down the road, if I was seeing them and didn’t even 
imagine that I would someday work with them.  
 
Well, you’ve probably seen a lot of the country. You’ve been many 
different places. We know kind of why you came back to Oklahoma, but 
you could have settled anywhere. Why do you feel comfortable in the 
Hugo area? 
 
We lived in Raleigh, North Carolina, and it grew exponentially, 
overnight. It went from a little town to a big town. A lot of New Yorkers 
moved into the area, and it was changing. It’s not the south anymore, 
and it’s not a small town. So we came here and I said, “Oh, my God, 
we’ve moved to Mayberry.” It doesn’t bother me one iota that the 
nearest Target is ninety miles away. If they don’t have it at Wal-Mart, I 
don’t need it. We used to drive—my daily commute to work was about 
from here to Paris, which was almost thirty miles, each way. When we 
first came to Hugo, we lived right across the street. We lived on Carson 
and Barnes winter quarters, and I would, literally, my morning commute 
was a walk across the street to the office. I could leave my house at eight 
twenty-five and be at work at eight thirty. That was if there was traffic 
on Kirk Road.  
 
One thing we love about Oklahoma is it is still old-fashioned. People 
tend to just let their neighbors be, as long as you’re not breaking the law. 
North Carolina was so over-run with covenants and taxes and just, “Why 
can’t you stay open twenty-four/seven?” All these businesses were doing 
that, and people moved to North Carolina because they wanted to get 
away from the fast pace and big city, and it was turning into that. We 
have no traffic out here where we are now, and we just love it. We’ve 
met more people in the two years we’ve been in Hugo than we met in 
fifteen years in North Carolina. 
 
Well, what’s your most favorite thing about the circus today? When you 
think about the circus or are attending a circus, what just really excites

you the most? 
 
That it still exists. I just finished reading a book about Ringling Brothers 
in their heyday in the late—well, when they started, the late 1800s and 
early 1900s, into their heyday. Things have not changed. The process is 
still the same, and that blows my mind. I thought for sure things have 
been modernized. Now, I don’t care for Ringling Brothers now. I don’t 
care for Cirque de Soleil, but I still like the traditional tent circus. 
Everything’s manual. The costumes are still sparkly and spangly. The 
acts aren’t trying to be—oh, what’s the word I’m looking for—so 
unique. When you play Bokchito, Oklahoma, whatever act you do is 
unique enough for them. I have a friend who says, “You don’t get paid 
extra for killing yourself.” And you go to Cirque de Soleil and you see 
just really daring things, and they’re impressive, but they’re not 
presented circus-y. It’s more theatrical. And I like the theater, but if I 
want to go to the theater, I’ll go to the theater. If I want to go to the 
circus, I’ll go to the circus. You shouldn’t serve wine at a circus. You 
should get popcorn, peanuts, and a coke, cotton candy. 
 
Of all the places that you’ve performed or traveled, do you have a 
favorite venue, a favorite spot? 
 
Sheboygan, Wisconsin. Carson and Barnes would play there, right on 
the edge of Lake Michigan, almost every summer. It was right before 
back-to-school so it was a good finish to the season. They had a big 
drum and bugle corps that would come and play during the show. Some 
circus fans or circus family, I can’t remember, they would have a 
bratwurst cookout for all the circus people, with brats and ice cream. 
That was always a special place to play. There are good things and bad 
things about every part of the country. I miss the delis in New England 
and New Jersey, New York, but then I don’t miss the traffic. You don’t 
have the delis here, but you don’t have the traffic. Everything has its 
good and its bad. 
 
Were most of your friends circus related? 
 
Yes, growing up, they were. And it’s funny, I always had a hard time 
kind of making friends at home. I would always have one or two good 
friends in town, but I just was never in a clique or real popular. I was 
very shy. I used to be so shy. Gosh, painfully shy. Even when I was in 
high school, I wouldn’t go to the pep rallies. I’d get a pass to go to the 
library. I was just so shy. Even when I was working in town, I had some 
friends that I worked with, but we didn’t really socialize after work very 
much. It was so funny, when we were in North Carolina, we would tell 
all our friends these old circus stories and ridiculous things people said 
or did or whatnot, and now, I talk about, “Oh, so-and-so at the bank,”

and, “When I was in North Carolina, this.” It’s just, it’s funny. 
 
Well, if you were so shy, how did you work past that in order to get in 
front of three thousand people? 
 
Well, I never had a problem with the performing. I didn’t have to talk. I 
had a problem with—like Michael Jackson. He and I are just alike. He 
could do his performing, but once he was off the stage, he was very shy 
and quiet. Performing, I didn’t have to open my mouth. I was fine. It’s 
kind of like what actors say when they take on a new character. You do 
take on a different character. I would be in the back door, eating a 
Snickers bar with the worst posture in the world and the minute they 
started announcing me, I was Lovely LaDonna, Queen of the Air, 
perfect posture, graceful. I’d be in there in the morning swinging a 
fourteen pound sledgehammer over my head, driving stakes, but then 
being up on the trapeze, looking like a ballerina.  
 
Best of both worlds. 
 
Yes, it really was.  
 
How did you come up with the name? 
 
Back in the old days, they would say, “Miss Donna,” “Miss Holly,” 
“Miss so-and-so,” and I didn’t like that. Donna is just bland. I don’t 
know, I just, LaDonna, Lovely LaDonna, Queen of the Air. Actually, 
Brian LaPalme stole the Queen of the Air part off the Greatest Show on 
Earth. It was Lovely Miss Holly, Queen of the Air, Greatest Show on 
Earth. So we stole that. 
 
If you had your choice today, would you continue working in the front 
office, or if you could go back on the road tomorrow, would you? 
 
If I could go on the road and have a driver, I would do it. I just am not a 
morning person. I don’t know how I got up at five o’clock in the 
morning and drove. It’s all I can do to get to work by eight o’clock now, 
and it’s only twenty minutes away. But there are things I miss about it. I 
really enjoy having my nights off, my weekends off, I can sleep in, I can 
do something. I do miss my friends on the circus, but at least here in 
Hugo, we have friends. Rob’s just getting to know them, but we have 
friends that I’ve known since I was little. Lucy [Loyal] and Moira [Loter 
Curiel] and Alfredo [Curiel] and the Rawls and—oh, I can’t think of all 
the people in Hugo. I think that’s pretty much it, but we’ll get together 
from time to time and visit. 
 
Lucy’s been out here. In fact, she gave us two of those horses. We

socialize more here than we ever did in Raleigh. Since circus people are 
here, it does get in your blood. It does. Rob didn’t do it long enough. He 
did it for two years, and he never really did it long enough. It didn’t get 
in his blood. When the circus would come to North Carolina, I’d end up 
going by myself or with a friend. He’s just not a big circus fan, and he 
and Alfredo get along good, and they work together sometimes. He and 
Lucy help each other out with stuff. But he would just like them on a 
personal basis, not just because they’re circus. 
 
He’s had to learn the circus lingo? 
 
Yes, he’s a real quick learner. The first word you learn is “donniker.” 
I’m sure you’ve heard that one.  
 
Well, we’ve heard people say it before. 
 
I believe it’s the toilet. 
 
Yes, it is. There is a lot of circus lingo. A lot of it isn’t used anymore, 
like, “cutting up jackpots,” would be telling old stories. You don’t really 
hear that one anymore, but everybody still calls the donniker the 
donniker and you’ve got the front yard and the back yard, and elephants 
are called bulls whether they’re female or male. Basically, the 
performing apparatus, you’ve got web, which is just a rope with a loop 
on it. What are some of the other ones that people wouldn’t know? A 
liberty act compared to a dressage or a menage act. They’re all horse 
acts, they’re just different kinds.  
 
And the rolling globe? 
 
That’s the big globes that people walk on, and most of the time, they’ll 
end by going up a really steep and high ramp. I know I’m boring. 
 
Oh, no. So what happens when somebody falls in love between the front 
and back yard? Is that a no-no? 
 
Not anymore. It used to be, I mean, way back in the day. Like I said, my 
first boyfriend, he was a candy butcher, worked in the concession stand. 
He also helped set up the tent, and I was a performer but that was not a 
big deal. My second boyfriend on the circus was the ringmaster, the evil 
ringmaster. I’m going to leave this one on the record. He was just a 
horrible mean person. I had learned the cloud swing and was saving my 
pennies, getting the extra money, saving my pennies. I planned on 
leaving him at the end of the season, and I wanted to buy my own truck 
and trailer and be on my own, and Rob had already been on the circus. 
He worked with the elephants, and so evil ringmaster couldn’t believe I

was leaving him for a shit shoveler, but nobody cared. I was a 
performer, he was a shit shoveler, and he was a nice shit shoveler. 
We’ve been together eighteen years. 
 
You were prepared to buy your own rig? 
 
Yes, I was going to leave him and go on my own anyway, at the end of 
the season, and we just kind of moved it up a little bit.  
 
Is that kind of unusual, if you had followed through, for a single woman 
to have her own rig, to be traveling? 
 
No, it’s not unusual. It’s unusual if she stays single the whole season. 
Usually, there’s a romance that buds up somehow. You are so close to 
those people. And it may not be a romance, it may be a really close 
friendship, but the guy will usually move in with her, or if he’s single 
and she’s living in a sleeper and he’s got a trailer, she’ll move in with 
him. It goes either way. And some of the romances only last for the 
season, if that long. Some of them go on for years. 
 
During those two hundred or so days, if you were to get sick would you 
still have to perform? 
 
It depends on how sick you were. I usually missed one day a season. I 
would have just a horrible stomach virus and there was no way you 
could leave the trailer, literally, no way. Again, the show must go on, 
and they’d just rearrange the acts or put in an extra clown gag where 
your act was or something. Some people have never missed a day. I 
mean, it’s very rare, but the show will always go on. You may miss an 
act or two. More common is that they would break down and not be able 
to make it to the lot, and then they miss one show. They may miss a few 
days. It depends. But that was more common than getting sick.  
 
Would you ever get lost on your way to the next lot? 
 
Yes. It’s called blowing the arrows, and I think all of the tented shows 
here, they do have a guy that goes the day before and puts up arrows that 
show you where to turn or whatnot, and everybody’s blown the arrows. 
Sometimes the police in the town or wherever you are, they’ll take the 
arrows down not realizing what they are, or maybe realizing what they 
are. I don’t know. Sometimes you just space out and you blow them. So 
Rob, in fact, he took the elephants thirty miles south when he was 
supposed to go north. He didn’t realize it for thirty miles. Had to turn 
around and come back north thirty miles. (Laughs) He went a total of 
sixty miles out of his way. But everybody’s done it, even the circus 
owners.

You’d have to be a pretty good driver to pull these rigs into tight spots. 
 
Oh, yes. For me, for most of my circus life, I didn’t drive. When I was 
planning on leaving, and we just moved it up a little bit, was the first 
time I bought my truck and trailer and actually had to drive. We just 
happened to be playing New York, and oh, I was so scared on the 
Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. Usually I drive like a granny, and I was 
driving so fast because I just wanted to hurry up and get off of there. 
Sparks were coming out from under the trailer. I was just hitting every 
pot hole—just, ching! Ching! Ching! I don’t even know how fast I was 
going. I just wanted to get off that thing, because you can drive on little, 
windy country roads, you can be in the middle of New York or New 
Jersey, or you can just be on a really nice interstate. One of the things 
that Clyde Beatty-Cole Brothers does is they open in Florida and they go 
up. They play all along the East Coast, and they usually follow, I think 
it’s I-95, and so most of their route is on the interstate. They’ll go off for 
a few miles, but they’ve got that worked out pretty good.  
 
I think it’s interesting how they hit different spots. They probably 
crisscross some… 
 
Some do. Some shows have their designated route, and some shows 
don’t respect other shows’ routes and some do. Some don’t want to take 
the hassle of the East Coast. The permits are harder, more toll roads, the 
IFTA, the truck requirements are so much stricter. Some don’t want to 
do the mountains in California so it just depends.  
 
Now, this is hearsay—but a father and son both own shows, and I hear 
that the son—no, the father took down all the son’s posters and played 
the town a week before his son was going to be there. So there’s still 
some of that, but for the most part, I think they try to respect each 
other’s territory these days. It’s gotten more legit than in the old [days]. I 
don’t even know how it was in the ’40s and ’50s and ’60s. You hear 
stories about how they’re trying to sneak on a lot or whatever, and they 
all get their permits now, and everything has to be inspected. It’s just a 
legitimate business. 
 
You’re with Culpepper and Merriweather now. How many performers 
do they have, and what is their target towns that they like to get? 
 
It’s a very small show. The Dykes family does most of the acts. Simone 
does the trapeze. Paulina does the web. Lana does the birds. Their aunt, 
Natalie Cainan, does the dog act, and she’s also ring mistress for half the 
show. Simone is ring mistress for half the show, and then they have 
another family who, the girl does hula hoops, and the boy does juggling,

and they do a Russian swing into this net. I’ve seen very few of them. 
And B.K. Silverlake’s son, Mel Ray, he and his wife—or if she’s home 
with the kids, somebody else assists him in a whip act, which you don’t 
see many of those anymore. I thought that was really entertaining. That’s 
most of the performers. [And of course Trey opens the show with his cat 
act.] 
 
How big of a lot is the optimal size? 
 
Three hundred by three hundred feet. I do have to tell the sponsors that. 
Well, the ones that don’t know. So about ninety thousand square feet, 
which is small. It’s a small circus. It’s a one-ring tent, and they do have 
the cats so they need some room for the cats. They have to put a canopy 
out for shade and so they need room for that. But if it’s a small lot, the 
performers could have just enough room to open the doors and squeeze 
out if they have to, and that’s on any show. Everybody has the slide outs 
on their trailers now and some lots, you can’t open those. 
 
So the towns that Culpepper tries to hit are two or three thousand 
people? 
 
Yes, about that. That’s going to be about the average, I think, the 
average size. And the people love it because a lot of them are kind of 
like here in Hugo. Now, Hugo is different because so many circuses 
winter here, but a lot of those small towns are far away from the big city, 
and so they have that to do. And they may drive to the state fair when it 
comes, but there’s not a lot to do. Still, Culpepper plays the small 
agricultural towns. Everybody knows everybody. It’s great, and I don’t 
know that they’ve ever gone east of the Mississippi. They do mostly the 
West and the Midwest. 
 
You said you came back [to Hugo] in 2008. How did they find you to 
even invite you to come back for the job or how did that work? 
 
There was a girl that—she and her family—her mother was from a 
circus family, and they were considered towners. We considered them 
towners, but in the summer, she and her family would come and visit 
Carson and Barnes for a few months every year. I think her father had 
some exotic animals that he would take to school assemblies during the 
school year. He would have his summers off, and they would travel with 
us. Somehow, she got my e-mail address or found me somehow and sent 
me an e-mail, and it was really odd. Rob and I were in North Carolina at 
the time, and we were driving down to Texas to visit his family. We 
were going through some state, I can’t remember where, and we saw a 
Carson and Barnes tent as we were driving by the interstate. He asked if 
we wanted to stop. I said, “No, I really want to get to Texas. Let’s just

keep going.” And I thought, “Well, I won’t see them for a while,” 
because they rarely go to North Carolina. When we were in Texas, we 
looked at some places in Texas that we might like to move to. We were 
just getting a little dissatisfied with Raleigh, and then we got the call and 
ended up here. And like I said, he won’t admit it, but he loves it here. 
 
It’s that connection. It seems like once you’re in the circus, you’re 
almost always in the circus in some way. 
 
Well, he just likes Oklahoma. Like I said, he won’t admit it. You see the 
Texas shrine here, but he loves Oklahoma. 
 
Well, as we start winding down, this is something that has popped up in 
several of our interviews. Do you have any thoughts about the 
differences between circus folk and carnival folk? 
 
Only the stereotypes that I’ve heard of. We used to go to the state fair in 
Raleigh every year and I would look at the—now, granted, I would look 
at the people and get an idea about them. That being said, there’s an 
author, G.D. Gearino, if I’m pronouncing his name correctly, he wrote, 
What the Deaf Mute Heard. They did a movie about it with Matthew 
Modine in it. Well, he’s a writer for the Raleigh News and Observer, and 
he went out to Roberts Brothers Circus one year. This was when I was 
living in Raleigh, and Roberts Brothers was in Fuquay-Varina [North 
Carolina]. So he went out there and came back and wrote an article 
about how filthy circus people were, it’s just dirty and whatnot. I read 
the article. I was a teller at the bank at the time so I was under my teller 
window, on the phone, “Did you talk to anybody? Did you know they 
were in mud up to their axles the day before? You worked heavy 
equipment in the summers, did you wear a suit and tie when you were 
working heavy equipment? No, you probably had on dirty jeans and no 
shirt.” And I read him the riot act.  
 
So he went out the next year with me, met the people. There’s a guy that 
used to manage a funeral parlor, a former IBM-er. A lot of people that 
are smart and clean—they may not have an education, a formal 
education, but they are smart. And he met these people and wrote the 
nicest article about the circus after that. I try not to stereotype. You look 
out here, and there’s no grass, and anybody driving by would think, 
“Those horses are neglected. There’s no grass.” We’ve got hay there. 
We just had the pasture—this was all trees back here. We had five acres 
of trees. We just had those cut down so we can get a pasture for them, 
but if somebody drove by right now, they would see something that 
would be not attractive. So no, I just try not to stereotype anybody. But 
carnies do smell like cabbage, I hear. Have you seen Austin Powers?

Yes (Laughter).  
 
I was going to say, when you were talking about, “Well, tell us about 
your life,” “Oh, the details of my life are quite inconsequential. 
Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons.” Yes. (Laughter) 
 
Would you do it all over again? 
 
I don’t regret a minute—well, I do regret a few minutes, but each step 
brought me here. So if I had missed that step, I would have missed this, 
maybe. So no, I don’t regret any of it. There were some that weren’t as 
fun as others and some that were more fun than others, but all is said and 
done. I’m here. I love it.  
 
Do you miss any of the foods that your father cooked in the cookhouse? 
 
Yes, I do. Yes, I do. He had a cook and a cook’s helper. He had a lady 
that would make the most delicious desserts from scratch. She would 
make these wonderful cobblers or—oh, my gosh! Yes. And I say, “Well, 
I was used to his cooking.” He was on a strict budget. He had to feed a 
lot of people for little money so lunches were usually some kind of a 
casserole or a goulash or something. Dinners would be maybe a pork 
chop or a chicken quarter or something. They could have as many 
vegetables as they wanted. They could only get one serving of meat, and 
that was anybody, and one serving of dessert. But everybody said 
everything was tasty, they were full. D.R. [Miller] did say beans had to 
be served at every meal, some kind of bean. 
 
Green beans or pintos or limas or what? 
 
Pintos or limas or kidney beans or great northern beans, but I still love 
beans. I think it was the best place to be raised. I don’t regret it. I’m glad 
my parents did it. I think they are, too. Not to just toot our own horn—
and this may have happened even if we hadn’t joined the circus, but my 
dad has three kids, none of us have ever been in any trouble. The worst 
thing we did is I would tell my parents, “I’m going to point A,” and I 
would start out at point A and end up at point B. If I was grounded, I 
never snuck out of my room or never tried to sneak out, because I knew 
somebody would see me and squeal on me. And just all the things that 
I’ve brought into my adult life, I think part just because I had good 
parents and part from being on the circus.  
 
When I was at the bank, we had a last minute bond closing. I ended up 
in the corporate trust department, and we had a bond closing that had to 
be done by eleven o’clock the next day. We were having trouble with 
attorneys and cooperating with other banks and getting everything we

needed. The guy I worked for, his mother had just passed away, so he 
had to take off. So I stayed until seven o’clock that night trying to get all 
the information I could. The next morning I told the manager that he was 
going to have to approve a forty million dollar wire, and his quote to me 
is, “Well, I’ll be in a meeting, and I can’t be disturbed.” I’m like, “We’re 
bringing in forty million dollars of business. Can’t you excuse yourself 
from the meeting for one second? I’m sure they’ll understand.” Here I 
was busting my hump to do everything to make sure this transaction 
went through, and he was blowing it off. But the show must go on, still. 
 
Where do you see the show going in the next ten to twenty years? 
 
It’s hard to say because it has been legitimized so much. A lot of towns 
make it really difficult for circuses, even if the circuses want to go on. 
That’s one thing that happened to Ringling Brothers. They couldn’t find 
places big enough for them to set up their outfit or people would just 
throw the book at them, “You need this permit, you need this permit, 
you need this permit,” and they would make up permits. When I was 
working for Carson and Barnes, I had a folder this thick (gestures) of 
permits for Denver, Colorado. They were saying that we need the 
architect of the tent to send us their scale drawings, blah, blah, blah, 
blah, blah. I mean, just ridiculous stuff, and the actual tent was made in 
one country. The poles were made in another country. The wires were 
made in another country. I think we eventually played Denver, but it was 
talking to the fire department. I spent weeks on one permit for one town. 
So that’s going to hurt the circus. 
 
As long as people are smart enough and just say, “It’s a tent. It goes up 
and down every day. They’ve been doing this for how many years? They 
know how to do it.” Yes, a tornado may come through, but look at 
buildings that have been destroyed by tornados. People just want to give 
the circus a hard time sometimes. That’ll be the downfall of it. Friends I 
know that have kids that are in it, the kids are still learning the acts and 
wanting to follow in their parents’ footsteps. They do schooling so they 
do both, but a lot of them like to travel and work and perform.  
 
What do you miss most? 
 
I miss seeing the different countryside. I don’t miss the driving. I just 
miss the people, but like I said, there are some good circus people that 
are retired here so that helps. Honestly, I’ve turned into an old fuddy-
duddy. I couldn’t keep up with the pace on the road now.  
 
Or sleep in the sweat house? Is that what you called it? 
 
Sweat box is what it was called. (Laughter) That’s what they called it.

Everything has a nickname, but it wasn’t that hot. 
 
Single bed? 
 
Yes, a single bed, and the way it worked was it was, the box was the 
width of a semi-trailer, but there was one living quarters on one side and 
one on the other. So if you had a lower bunk here, you had a shelf up 
here, and that was the bunk from the other side coming over your head. 
If you lived on that side, you had an upper bunk. If you lived on this 
side, you had a lower bunk. That’s another thing about the circus is you 
would learn how to make the maximum amount of use out of the 
minimum amount of space. 
 
Our water froze up out here. This is a fixer-upper. The water froze up 
last winter when we had the horrible ice storm. I went to a place where 
you can buy gallons of water, and I knew how to heat water on the stove, 
and I could stand in the shower and take a full shower with five gallons 
of water. 
 
Another thing on the circus is, most of them, the generator goes off 
around eleven o’clock at night and doesn’t come on until nine the next 
morning. So you learn to do without electricity for a few hours every 
night. Now, I think most everybody has their own personal generator so 
they don’t miss their TV shows. They all have satellites now. They have 
these cell phones that do everything. It blows my mind. 
 
Times have changed. 
 
They have. 
 
Well, they’re probably missing out on something, too, because they have 
those things.  
 
Maybe. They still have the camaraderie. My friend Robin, I always use 
her as an example because I see her more than anybody. Everybody will 
pile into her trailer to watch American Idol or watch the, she calls them 
the “Beat ‘Em Ups,” whatever the fights that they do. They all pile into 
her trailer, and the kids—that’s another thing I love about this place. It 
blew my mind. I went to the library a week or two ago. There were two 
bicycles out on the bicycle rack. Children actually rode to the library, on 
their own. They didn’t have Mom drive them and weren’t forced to go. 
You would not see that in North Carolina, and the kids on the circus are 
outside playing all the time. I see kids outside all the time, here. I never 
saw that in North Carolina, beautiful parks and never a kid in them. Yes. 
Like I said, it’s like living in Mayberry here.
