Sue Masser Interview Log 
0:00:04.0 Debbie Fant introduces herself on November 26, 2013, interviewing Sue Masser at 
her home in Mountlake Terrace, Washington.  
0:00:40.2 Sue was born in Charlottesville, VA, where her parents were university students. She 
moved to Seattle in 1981 with a musician. She attended her first Northwest Folklife Festival in 
1982.  
0:01:01.6 Sue graduated high school in 1973, went to Christopher Newport University, a 
subsidiary of the College of William and Mary, and majored in Psychology and Sociology. 
0:01:29.1 When she came to Seattle, she went to work for the University of Washington 
hospital, because she'd spent all her time up to that point working in the medical industry in 
critical care as a unit secretary and in office management. She did that for 25 years, in various 
offices and hospitals. She was not a union member in the health care industry--they unionized 
after she left the UW.  
0:02:04.0 Now Sue describes herself as a union stagehand. She started working in theater in 
junior high school. She worked in nonprofessional theater, community theater, semi-
professional theater. She became a stage manager in 1976, worked as a stage manager up 
through 1997. Met her husband in 1996, got married, and he moved from Canada and stated 
working with IATSE (International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees). She followed him 
into the union a year afterward.  
0:02:55.0 She worked doing stage management during evenings and weekends, and during the 
day doing medical office management. You start out working on a show, say, a community 
theater. Start out working backstage. Sooner or later somebody needs to be in charge and 
organized, and you become that person. Because you're organized and you can track detail and 
minutiae and can do work. You move from being one of the stagehands to being the guy who's 
running the stagehands to being the guy who's running the show. It's an organizational and 
motivational position more than anything.  
0:03:56.0 In Seattle, she worked in Driftwood Theater, Village Theater, Open Circle Theater, a 
number of projects she managed for Fringe Fest, when that was going on, and The Group. 
Musically, for Northwest Folklife, she ran stages for music performances for a number of years 
starting in the 1990s. 
0:04:33.2 The stage manager positions were not union. She was planning to move on to equity 
stage management track, but that got sidelines when she lost her job and was not in the 
position to do that. It was on her plate, but didn't happen.  
0:05:03.8 Working in private practice for dentists and doctors when you work with patients, but 
working with solo practitioner offices, and you don't have any protection as an employee. Over 
Washington State Workers 
afc2012/032

and over you and your friends get fired, lose benefits, lose pay, don't get cost-of-living 
increases, and work under some pretty rigorous conditions without being appropriately 
compensated. You have bosses in Seattle who say, "You can work as many hours as you need to 
do the job, but I will never, ever pay you overtime. You can work a 60-hour week, you'll get paid 
straight time for every hour you work." Or, "If you want vacation, the only time you can go is 
when I take mine, because you can't be out of the office when I'm not." So if your father comes 
into town, and you haven't seen him in two years, and you want three hours off on a Friday 
afternoon before he leaves town? Too bad. I got tired of being pushed around. I liked the 
protection of working with a union.  
0:06:22.3 I got into this (union) because I've always stayed involved with the stage at all points 
in my life. I wanted to change, and the opportunity was there. I realized I could really do the 
work. I was doing the work, I just wasn't in the union. I realized I could do it, and do it better, 
and get paid and have protection. That was really attractive.  
0:06:46.1 That was in 1997. 
0:07:01.3 The process that you go through? An interview, a test that shows you can tie the 
appropriate knots--bowline and clove hitch. And you go through an interview and a written 
test. And you're admitted as a "permit worker." That allows you to work for the union on any 
union calls that are large enough to reach you. So you start at the bottom of the seniority list. 
As you gain hours, and you work more hours, you climb up that list. Seattle is unique in that the 
local has five lists: At one point the A List, the top list, was restricted to 100 people. There were 
a number of women who took that to court and won to have that A List expanded. We work 
our way up over the number of hours we work over the years. You start out as a permit worker, 
and you get called when the work reaches down to where you are on the list, you take that 
work. And as you do more work, you get higher up, and you get more and more options. Once 
you reach 1000 hours of union work, you are required to join the union. Or you can be a 
"conscientious objector" and just pay the dues that do not include any political lobbying in 
order to be dispatched by the union. But you can't continue to work for the union, through the 
union, without becoming a member past a certain point.  
0:08:58.5 In 1997 she took the test, tied the knots, did the interview. 
0:09:11.7 SM: My first job at Seattle Center was Celine Dion. That was the big year of "The 
Titanic," and the song was "My Heart Will Go On," and there was a big heart-shaped stage with 
the prow of the boat on it so that when she (Dion) stood on the stage, her hair would blow 
back. I built the ship railing. It was down inside the stage and it rises up pneumatically at the 
end of the show for the encore. That was the first thing I did for Seattle Center. Some of the 
other work I did early on was West Side Story at the Mt. Baker Theater where I loaded trucks in 
the snow, Boston Pops at the Tacoma Dome where I loaded trucks the day after loading trucks 
in the snow at the Mt. Baker. Lot of Key Arena calls, a lot of big concerts. I earned my 100th 
hour in the Local, which puts me off the F List and onto the E List. It was earned on Marilyn 
Washington State Workers 
afc2012/032

Manson and Hole in 1999. That was my hundredth hour. A historic tour that broke up, I think, 
ten days after it left Seattle. 
 
0:10:34.4 DF: So you do load-ins and load-outs for a lot of the big rock concerts? (Umm hmmm) 
What's that like?  
 
0:10:42.1 Controlled chaos at its best. You get six trucks, 26 trucks, 34 trucks to unload, 34 if it's 
Madonna, 16 if it's Michael Bublier. And you've got the road crew that comes with that show, 
and they're the ones that direct how everything goes together. So there's a crew that's on the 
tour that knows that comes out of the truck and where it goes and how it gets put together and 
how to make this thing happen. Because it's all got to come out of the truck today, get 
assembled, have a show happen, get back in the truck, and be in Portland or Vancouver 
tomorrow. So those guys have to be able to direct a crew of 100-some odd people and get the 
rigging up and get the trucks unloaded and get the fork lifts where they want them and get the 
stagehands broken into crews to do all the various components of the show.  Like the 
carpenters who build the stage and the electricians who hang the lights and the sound guys 
who hang the sound speakers and the video guys who hang the screens and the projectors and 
the pyrotechnics guys who blow things up--or control-blow things up.  
 
Like I did last week on the Trans Siberian Orchestra. Spent an entire day doing pyro, came home 
covered in explosives. (Hard to get through the airport security that way! Yeah! Not going to go 
through airport security soon!) Licensed pyrotech guys carry their cards and get stopped a lot!  
 
0:12:27.1 DF: So you started making your way up the list. What does that mean that after 100 
hours to F List--all the new people. . .  
 
0:12:45.6 The 100th hour gives you your qualifying date, and that's what gives you your union 
seniority for LIFE. That "qual" date is the all-important date we all strive for. That day sets my 
seniority with everyone else who came into the local before or after me. If two people have the 
same "qual" date, exact same date, they're put into alphabetical order by last name. She'd have 
to look for her date, but remembers that the qualifying show was Marilyn Manson. Some days 
you work for Marilyn Manson, some days you work for Eric Clapton. Some days are better than 
others.  
 
0:13:38.7 DF: Tell me specifically what you focus on doing as a union stagehand?  
 
0:13:48.0 People like me who work what we call "the bounce," who don't have a job in a local 
theater or local shop, go from show to show to show, job to job as they roll through town. 
We're really jacks of all trades. I could be working in Props at the Fifth Avenue at a show as I 
was recently for "Anything Goes," I could be working audio for the Paramount Theater, hanging 
speakers, running cables setting up microphones, mic-ing a drum kit. I can be a carpenter and 
build a stage or take down a stage. I do everything but rigging. I don't drive a forklift. My 
husband isn't an ETPC-certified rigger, but is a certified lift operator. He is 20 numbers above 
me in the list and just because of that, is right at the cusp where he has a lot of options for 
Washington State Workers 
afc2012/032
3
work. But he has a lot more options than I do because of those specialized skills that he has. I 
haven't invested the time in those.  
 
I have a small fear of heights and don't want to rig. I don't want to be at the top of a tall 
building hanging steel. But I ground-rig, I do run follow-spot, I do a lot of audio work, that's my 
focus. That is something that is, I do a lot of work now as a lead in audio, I do a lot of work as an 
A2 doing deck sounds, which is setting up the microphones for shows and working on shows. 
An A2 is the guy who works the show deck with the musicians. The A1 is the guy who's out 
mixing sound at the front of the house. A stands for Audio. A2 is on stage and sets the 
microphones and cables, does the patch which determines which instrument shows up where 
on the sound board for the A1. It's a lot of fun. DF: So it's really varied.  
 
0:15:59.5 It's extremely varied. It's a good occupation for people who would not do well in 
conventional jobs where they have to show up Monday through Friday from 9 to 5 and do the 
same thing over and over. It's an excellent job for people who are challenged by those kinds of 
positions because they do get variety. My husband is ADHD. Your average ADHD adult changes 
jobs every two years because they get bored, or they sabotage themselves and get fired, but 
their average lifespan in a job is two years. But because he doesn't do the same thing every day, 
because some days he's a rigger, and some days he's doing sound, and it's not 9-5, Monday 
through Friday, he's been doing this very successfully since 1997 and no end in sight. A great 
job for that. Also have some people who are pretty marginalized. There's a fair number of 
people in my local who are bi-polar. And while having a routine is really good for bi-polar 
people and being in a set position, the hours aren't set and the flexibility is good for them. So 
it's an interesting mix of people who make up this field.  
 
0:17:17.1 DF: For eight years you were a dispatcher for the local. I want to hear how you got 
into it and what that all involved.  
 
0:17:31.4 In 1999 I went to work for a dentist who had recruited me to come in and manage his 
practice with great promises and a signing bonus, and it was going to be wonderful. And eight 
weeks later, I had six weeks of bad paychecks. I had hit my maximum with doctors and dentists 
and all those issues, which is back to why I like unions. So I was working for the union, I called 
and said, "Hey, I need work! The day job thing, not so much! Please find something for me." 
They said, okay, you can go down to the Opera Warehouse in Kent and unload The Ring, 
because the brand-new Ring set had come up to the Opera House (in Seattle) to be teched, 
they weren't doing the actual performances.  
 
They just brought all the set pieces up--53 semis full of pieces--up to the Opera House and 
moved them around and looked at how they all went together and how to improve them and 
what needed work for the upcoming performances. So I went down and unloaded 53 semis, 
and somewhere in the process of that, we got through it. And they were looking for 
dispatchers, and back to the "I am an organized person thing." (Oh, I hate you! Fant took Sue 
Masser’s photo.) They were looking for dispatchers, and I was not comfortable not having a job. 
I have always had full-time work. So I went "Pick me, pick me!" And they did. And I trained to 
Washington State Workers 
afc2012/032
4
dispatch. Right at that time a lot of changes were made to their system that were not popular 
and our business agent at the time left shortly thereafter to take a fulltime job at Benaroya Hall, 
our lead dispatcher left to take a fulltime job at Seattle Center, and I got left holding the bag on 
a brand-new system of dispatching that a lot of people were unhappy with.  
 
0:19:28.3 Training and dispatching means learning the systems and the rules. There are set 
rules for dispatch, set rules for the union on how you dispatch, starting at the top of the list.  
How many hours you have to wait for somebody to call back. All of the options that you get. 
How you look at their skills and determine what they are able to do and what they aren't able 
to do so you offer them all the work that fits their skill set but you aren't offering them work 
they aren't qualified to do. Then calling them and giving them all of those options and having 
them pick what they want and recording all that and tracking all that so you don't double-book 
a slot, so you don't forget to write somebody down and over-fill a call. And making sure that as 
you get calls that say, "Oh help! We forgot to call for people for today for the Rat City Roller 
Girls and we need a rigger and five grips out at Sand Point an hour ago," you have to know what 
the protocol is for dealing with that and getting those people and finding them and getting 
them out there as fast as possible.  
 
0:20:27.5 When the Nisqually Earthquake happened (in 2001), we then had to scramble and get 
qualified riggers to do rigging inspections in every theater in town before any performances 
could happen. To make sure there'd been no damage to the fly systems. To actually put a steel 
netting around the cornices and ornamental plaster in the Fifth Avenue Theater that was 
threatening to crumble. We had to do remedial work to get those houses back open. So I had to 
find riggers, Right Now! And I had to call people and tell them work had been cancelled, and I 
had to call people and say, Can you please go to work and help fix this thing at the Fifth 
Avenue? Dispatching is like playing 23 games of three-dimensional chess with people, 
simultaneously. You have to take 600 people and get them to the right place at the right time 
with the right skill sets that the employer needs. And make sure that the people in your union 
are getting the work they're supposed to have to keep a roof over their heads and food on their 
table.  
 
0:21:51.4 DF: What were the changes that people objected to with the new system?  
 
0:21:55.8 Sounds simple, but the big one was that they had to call in their availability every 
week instead of just automatically being called for work. They thought that was a huge 
imposition and a huge deviation from the past. Which was, you called number One on the list 
and you waited four hours for him to call you back and give him all his choices. And if he didn't 
call back in four hours, you called number Two. And you wait four hours. You have to 
remember that in 1999, pagers were the norm. Cell phones were not. We still had guys who 
refused to carry pagers because they didn't want to be that tied in to technology.  
 
We've come a long, long way. Everybody has a cellphone. Everybody has access to call back. 
The four-hour rule was that people had four hours to call back based on the fact that everybody 
had to have a coffee break or a meal break within a four-hour time period. So if I left a message 
Washington State Workers 
afc2012/032
5
for them, I had to give them that opportunity to call back so if they were at work they could, 
either on a meal break or coffee break, take or reject work. But to tell them that they had to 
call in every week and say, "I'm available and I want work" was something they were just 
kicking and screaming about at the time.  
 
0:23:22.4 DF: Wouldn't that have caused a lot more work for the dispatcher to handle those 
600 plus calls every week?   
 
0:23:37.6 Before that rule came into effect, you had to call everybody on the list in order. You 
didn't know if they were available or out of town on a road show or on vacation, or if they were 
doing a day job. Some of the guys were fishermen. A lot of the stagehands in the early days 
were fishermen because there was no theater in the summer. And they went up to Alaska in 
the summers and fished. When I started dispatching, there were commercial fishermen who 
went up to Alaska every year. But by letting the dispatcher know they were available, you were 
only calling, out of the 600 people, you were only calling the 125 who were actually available 
that week. It made it much more efficient. Because calling everybody in order and waiting four 
hours wasn't efficient and was not working in terms of getting the work filled in an expeditious 
manner, because you're having to wait for people to go home and check their voice mail and 
call you back.  
 
0:24:42.7 DF: So tell me how that worked: It's Monday morning and you're in the office. People 
would call in then, and at the same time you also had calls you needed to make, right?  
 
0:24:58.3 At the time I was dispatching we were on call 24/7. We worked a ten-hour day for 
straight time. Usually with the belief that we were going to have breaks in the day. We worked 
in our homes, and phones were transferred electronically. So in the morning, if there were calls 
starting at the Key Arena and the Fifth Avenue and the Paramount at 8 am, you had your 
phones switched on and transferred to you by 7 am. Because people would be experiencing 
traffic problems, or somebody would be sick and couldn't make it to work and you had to field 
those calls and make replacements as quickly as possible so you had people to work at 8 or 8:30 
to fill holes. Also, if you were dispatching new people they may not know what door to get in, 
they may have trouble finding who their lead is, if they're at the Convention Center and there 
are six floors, they want to know, "Who am I looking for?"  
 
We would start based on what time work was starting for the stage hands, always by 8 am but 
sometimes by 6 am, 7 am. And we always had the phones on until the last call of the day had 
started and we'd verified that everyone was there. So if it was a Key Arena show, we'd have our 
phones on at 7:30 am and have them on until 11:30 at night. To make sure those last 
stagehands had gotten to work to do a load-out.  
 
0:26:28.4 DF: How many of you were working on dispatch?  
 
0:26:28.4 When I started, there were four. The winter of '99 there were two! We were down to 
two that winter. Then the maximum we had up through 2007 was six.  
Washington State Workers 
afc2012/032

0:26:50.2 DF: Tell me how that worked. A call would come in to a central place, and you're at 
home. And others are at home, too?  
 
0:26:59.5 The person who was actively working would have the calls transferred to them. So I 
would be working full time, and I would have another person working with me in my office--
there would be two in the office. One would be trying to handle emergencies or short-term 
issues, and one would be working on the next week to keep that advancing so we could make 
sure the calls for next week were getting filled in an orderly fashion. People were getting their 
work while we were taking care of today's crisis. It was a case of rotating people through. We 
had a lot of part-time people who were available for when we were really slammed or crunched 
for hours and needed extra people. We had one full-time weekday person and one full-time 
weekend person. And one person whose job it was to listen to all those calls on the availability 
voice mail and transfer them into an Excel spreadsheet so that we knew who was available. The 
stagehands say, "I'm available this week except for Monday, when I've got something between 
10 and 12." Or “I’m not available this weekend,” or “I'll be at the ballet all weekend but I could 
work in the evening.” So we had one person whose job it was to sit and listen to all of those 
voice mails and put them into an Excel spreadsheet in order. Through 2007, the average weekly 
call-in was between 120 and 200 people. Of the 600 on the list, that's how many were routinely 
calling in. The rough number of people we had a lot of work for.  
 
0:28:56.7 DF: Biggest challenge as a dispatcher?  
 
0:29:11.9 The biggest challenge as a dispatcher was getting all the people in all the right places 
at the same time. Because sometimes you would have calls at the Convention Center for 
Microsoft with 100 people, and calls at the Key Arena with 130 people, and the Paramount 
would have a show in production for Broadway.  They did Young Frankenstein the same 
summer that the Fifth Avenue did Shrek. We do a lot of pre-production for Broadway here. We 
have a lot of shows that have do their pre-production work and their tech and their first try-out 
here before they move over to New York. We're good for that. That's one of the things that's 
been filling up our summer times when we didn't used to have work in the summer. Doing 
Broadway pre-production work is in the summer now.  
 
So you'll have days when you need 350 people, and 125 people have called in! So you have to 
know where everybody is. So the Ballet is working today, but they'll be out at 3 o'clock. And the 
Key Arena load-out starts at 10:30, and they can walk over from McCaw Hall and be at the Key 
Arena by 10:15, so that rigging slot I can't fill, I can get one of the Opera guys who has a show in 
the evening to do the load-in, and I can get one of the Ballet guys to do the load-out. And I can 
split that one spot between two people. So knowing where all your people are, what their skills 
are, what their motivations are, what they want to do. If you know that Stagehand A always 
likes to work with B & C, and if you can get one of them you can get the other two?  It's like, 
"Hey! Want to go work with your friends?” Knowing all of your people, knowing what they can 
do, what motivates them, then translating that into filling all of the slots and not leaving an 
Washington State Workers 
afc2012/032
7
employer without the people they need. Making sure you have all the right skills. It's a constant 
challenge.  
 
0:31:29.4 DF: Do you remember the craziest day you had to dispatch?  
 
0:31:40.9 There were a lot of crazy days. The Nisqually Earthquake was crazy because that 
earthquake happened, and all of the stagehands in town were calling in to ask if they were 
supposed to go to work. Stagehands who were at the Convention Center were calling because 
they couldn't reach their families: "Please call my wife and tell her I'm okay." Those were kind 
of crazy because everybody's trying to call, the system's overloaded, and I just wanted to get 
out of my house where things were swinging! "I don't want to stay in my house, I just want to 
run away!" Staying cool and doing that work.  
 
0:32:18.0  Nine-eleven, 9/11 was a horrible, horrible day. First because of all the tragedy in New 
York and knowing we had union brothers and sisters in that town, and actors in that town. And 
at the same time, trying to fill a massive Washington Mutual company meeting that was 
supposed to happen in McCaw Hall that week. And still having to do all the dispatch work, and 
fill emergencies. One of the people who called me at 6 in the morning worked at the 
Paramount Theater. He called or paged me, woke me up, said something incomprehensible 
about "my brother," and "New York," and "my parents haven't heard from him" and "I need to 
go and be with my parents" and "I have a call at 8:30." That was at 6:30 am, and I was trying to 
figure out what was going on with his brother that this was such a crisis. And at 7 o'clock when 
I'm calling people, I called a stagehand who was a reliable emergency person, and I knew he 
was going to be up, because he was taking his brother to the airport because his brother was 
going to Washington, D.C. to spend time with his fiancé, who was working at the Library of 
Congress. So I knew that Chris was going to the airport, he should be home and awake, and he 
was a reliable emergency person. So I called and said, "Hey, Chris, I have this emergency at the 
Paramount." And he says, "I just took Anthony to the airport but I might have to go back. My 
father just called and said something about a plane crash. And he might not be able to fly out."  
 
And I turned on the TV at that point, just as they showed the second plane hitting the second 
tower. And then I had to work through that whole day and field calls from stagehands about 
"Am I supposed to go to work, what am I doing, where do I need to be." Cancelling shows, 
cancelling calls. Again, the work itself wasn't the whole challenge. Just the sheer emotion of 
that day and having to work through it, not having the luxury of falling apart. Not having the 
luxury of letting it fully impact me, having to do the work and get through it. That was a 
challenge. Having a stagehand here who didn't know if his wife was alive in Washington, D.C. 
Having stagehands here who were worried about their friends in New York. That reverberated 
through the union community.  
 
0:35:15.8 DF: What about the personalities you dealt with?  Were there nicknames for people? 
Tell me, were there ever any jokes among the stagehands, or terminology that is stagehand 
terminology--the jargon that you're already telling me about, like A1 or A2, that's the shorthand 
for the people doing the jobs.  
Washington State Workers 
afc2012/032

0:36:01.4 There is an item in the theatrical community now called a "Finch." It is a short 
electrical cable, one to three feet long. It is called a Finch because many years ago a stagehand 
named Finch was asked to make one 100-foot cable. And he made 100 one-foot cables. And 
everybody was, "Oh my god. What would we ever do with these? Why would you think we 
meant one-foot cables?" And they've turned out to be immeasurably useful when you just can't 
quite make that connection and you need that *little* bit more cable. It started here in Seattle, 
but it is actually a term that you hear road guys use when they come through.  "Hey, get me a 
Finch!" That's something that's out there in the industry that came out of Seattle and out of 
what was a huge mistake at the time but turned out to be a very fortuitous one! We refer to 
any short piece of cable as a Finch.  
 
0:37:28.1 DF: What about grumpy personalities?  You're calling people at all hours.  They're 
certainly calling YOU at all hours!  
 
0:37:32.0 They call you at all hours. My general rule of thumb was that we didn't call people in 
the middle of the night unless the call was two hours away. So they might call me at 3 in the 
morning, but if what I have is an 8 am call, I start calling at 6 am so that people get sleep.  
They're more likely to go to work.  They're more likely to answer their phone! And they're more 
likely to go to work at 6am than they are at 2:30 in the morning. Unless you know that they've 
just gotten off work. Every once in a while you know that they've just finished a load-out at the 
Paramount, and you can call them and ask, "Hey do you want to go to work first thing in the 
morning?" But most of the time you don't do that. You let stagehands sleep.  
 
0:38:15.0 DF: So what was the change that technology made, like cell phones now?  
 
0:38:22.4 Cell phones is the biggest change because people get information immediately now. 
We can text people. People can email now. All the technology that allows you to communicate 
without having to pick up the phone and talk with somebody is probably one of the biggest 
changes. Computerization, although we haven't found a computerized dispatch system that 
really works for all of the dispatch and union rules for this local. We haven't found one that 
automates it, so it still relies a lot on people and peoples' knowledge. And using a searchable 
database, like I need to see all the riggers who are Skill Level One, or I need to see who has a 
City [of Seattle]  forklift license because under OSHA/WISHA, you have to be trained by the 
employer on site on the equipment you're going to use. And the City of Seattle does in fact do 
that with all of their own forklift drivers. They do their own training, and they certify their own 
drivers. And I can't send anyone to drive a forklift at the City who isn't certified by the City. 
That's an OSHA/WISHA reg, and one that the City very firmly enforces. It's about their liability 
insurance, I'm sure.  
 
0:39:37.2 DF What's the craziest rule that was hardest to apply? Seems like, it's very clear that 
you have to follow an innumerable list of rules.  
 
Washington State Workers 
afc2012/032

0:39:55.4 There are innumerable rules. The hardest things are the interpretation of the rules. 
Because you and the business agent have all agreed that the rules are interpreted like this, then 
you have a stagehand who doesn't agree with that interpretation, and then you have to play 
that all out with the Executive Board and the business agent and work that through what the 
resolution is. And sometimes policies are built around that. We will treat emergencies, any call 
that's 24 hours and/or one working day away is an emergency. You don't have to wait four 
hours for people to call you back. And you can call, you don't have to go down the list in order. 
You can call people that you know are qualified and can take the work off your plate so that you 
can continue to work on the other 20 calls on your desk. But getting that handled, people 
getting their feelings hurt or people feeling that they should have been called for work they 
were not called for, "Well, you knew I was working, why didn't you wait?" Well, I'm not 
required to wait. “You choose not to have a cell phone or a pager, I can't reach you and I have 
to fill this and move one. And the rules allow me to do that."  
 
0:41:22.4 DF: So that transition to newer technology for older union members must have been, 
in some instances, difficult.  
 
0:41:31.0 It was. Back when the first changes were made that said you had to call in your 
availability, a very senior member who had been a brilliant electrician in his day but who had 
some organic brain disease and was rapidly losing his ability to work--and couldn't remember 
anything from minute to minute at the time--he got the part about calling in every week 
between 6 pm Monday and 8 am Friday down pat the first week. He had it all down--knew 
exactly what he had to do and when he had to do it. And he did it routinely. And all the other 
guys who couldn’t somehow make that call, or remember the hours, and "Oh my gosh. . .  .”  I 
said we should have a class, and all sit down and have Larry explain this to them. Cause if HE 
can get it, there's no excuse for the rest of them. And that was our shaming:  Okay, do I need 
Larry to come and explain this to you?  But it was challenging. We never ever made our most 
senior member, who was Don MacDonald, Sr., call in. He was number 1. He was in his 80s when 
I started dispatching. We celebrated his 90th birthday. He was a working stagehand through 
age 92, retired from stage work at 92 after a small stroke, and died at 93. But he worked up 
until age 92 as a stage hand. Ran follow spots in the Key Arena, climbed up to the apex of the 
Key Arena and ran follow spots, did work in the Seattle Center House with all of the community 
groups and bands on the Center House stage. Fabulous man. But we always gave him his due. 
He was number one, he didn't have to call and tell us he was available. He got his choice of the 
work he wanted. He was the nicest man. His son is in our union. His son is a rigger. His daughter 
is in the wardrobe local. The multigenerational family. (DF: Are there a lot of those?) There are 
a few. We have a husband/wife/daughter who are all in the local now. The husband's father 
was in the local, one of the long-term. That particular family has had members in the local for 
decades. I knew that dad didn't want his daughter following in his footsteps. She's excellent at 
it, she's good, she's going to run this local someday, she's so good. But it wasn't what he 
wanted for her. You see a lot of the older guys not wanting their kids in the business. It's a hard 
life.  
 
Washington State Workers 
afc2012/032
10
0:44:17.1 It's gotten harder. (How?) It's gotten harder with the economy, it's gotten harder to 
make a good living. It's gotten harder to get enough hours. It is a hard life. It's physical labor, it's 
hard on you. You're one injury away from losing it. We are all just one career-ending injury 
away from losing everything. That's hard. Most parents don't want to see their kids in that 
position.  
 
0:44:54.4 Have you been injured on the job? Fortunately, only minimally. A gouge here, a gash 
there. A strain. Northing's that's put me out of work. My husband has had surgery on both 
knees as a result of on-the-job injuries. Spent a year out with a back injury. It's a tightrope.  
 
0:45:22.7 DF: Do you wear any special clothes or shoes?  
 
0:45:26.4 Absolutely. All of us wear safety shoes, all of us have hard hats. All of us wear gloves. 
Lot of guys with kneepads, lot of guys with back braces, knee braces, wrist supports. You can 
see the walking wounded. But we are fortunate that we have not had more serious injuries. You 
work sleep-deprived, long hours, all the research will tell you that sleep deprivation is bad for 
you and causes injuries and accidents, and we're quite fortunate that we have so much safety 
drilled into us and so much awareness of the potential for injury drilled into us. And periodically 
you see the pipe that runs at the Fifth Avenue Theater, and bricks come flying off the load floor, 
and you hold your breath and say, "Thank god nobody was injured!" And you remember that 
what you're doing is a very dangerous job. And that's why we get paid what we get paid. And 
that's why we do the training we do. Because what we do is dangerous. We hang big heavy 
things over peoples' heads, we carry big heavy things in our hands, we move big heavy things 
with forklifts that may or may not be weighted well. It's dicey sometimes.   
 
0:47:02.0 DF: What happens when you, first of all, what are the rules concerning calls? One is 
called in, they work a minimum of four hours, is that right?  
 
0:47:21.3 Most of our contracts, there are a number of contracts at play here, we don't have 
just one standard contract. But most often it's a four-hour minimum, and most often our 
contracts, if there's a two-hour or more break in the work, you have a second four-hour 
minimum. SO:  If you do the load-in at the Paramount this morning from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM 
and you go back tonight at 10:00 PM, even though your load-out may only take two hours, it's 
still a four-hour minimum. If I went to work and worked from 8-1 and had an hour off for lunch, 
when I came back to the Key Arena, it would be a two-hour minimum after lunch. Not a four.  
Because I've only had an hour break. Sometimes you work a full four hours on a four-hour call, 
and you work hard. Sometimes you go in to do a load-out at the Paramount--like last night, we 
were called in at 10:30 PM. We actually didn't start work until 11:00. We were done at 1:00 
AM. We were paid for four hours. So we got to drive home on the clock and get into your 
jammies while still getting paid. Every once in a while you get that extra little bonus. 
 
0:48:38.2 DF: So, you stopped doing dispatch. What happened with that?   
 
Washington State Workers 
afc2012/032
11
0:48:42.8 We had some changes in the local and some changes in business agents, and it wasn't 
a good fit and most of my team felt like it was not a good place to work at the time. And so, 
there was a bunch of dispatch turnover in 2007. And I went to work full-time as a stagehand.  
 
0:49:04.7 DF: What's the most fun show you've been involved with?   
 
0:49:12.7 There's different variations of "fun." One of the most fun things I did was work on the 
call out at the Microsoft Campus, where I'd been called to work at 2 in the morning with 
another stagehand who was called in to be the head. And we got out there and the client said, 
"Oh, I'm really glad you're here. We've never made this client (Microsoft) happy, and they've 
fired people, and we know you're going to do a good job with this and you've both got 
broadcast experience. . .." And we both looked at each other and went, "Broadcast????? 
Nobody said anything about broadcast to us!!" And it wound up that what they were doing was 
panel discussions broadcast through the Microsoft studio internationally in eight languages. 
And I was doing all of the wireless microphones on the guys on the panels. And that was sort of 
a trial by fire for me, I didn't have a lot of experience with wireless microphones, but the fun 
part was rising to the challenge, meeting it, and having them, at the end of the week, the 
Microsoft guys on air, internationally, thank both our client and the two sound guys. Both 
myself and the other sound guy. By name. This from a client who had previously fired people on 
the spot for not being able to do the work. So that was really satisfying. That was fun!  
 
Sometimes "fun" is getting to spend the day in pyrotechnics and do something different. Most 
fun ever was getting to run follow-spot for Lion King at the Paramount Theater. That was the 
most fun ever. (DF: And why?) Because I'm afraid of heights and I had to climb 25 feet and 
stand on a little itty-bitty platform and conquer that fear. And because I did that, and I hadn't 
run a spotlight in 20 years. I went out and practiced at the Children's Theater in the afternoon 
and got a little more comfortable with that. But the show is fast, and it moves fast, and there's 
a lot of technical experience that you need--or technical expertise. And the challenge of making 
a blind pickup in the dark on Simba's head and nailing it is a lot of fun! It's like, "Oh Yes!  I did 
it!!" So first, conquering the height thing and climbing those 25 feet to the platform every day, 
and twice on weekends, that was fun. It was a fun, fun show!  
 
0:51:50.7 Years later, I was sitting beside my stage at Folklife, not paying a lot of attention to 
what was on stage because I was looking ahead at the stage plot for the next band and planning 
what microphones I needed and how many, and all of a sudden my brain started throwing spot 
cues at me. And I was trying to figure out why my brain was throwing "Lion King" spot cues at 
me. And I realized that the bluegrass band on stage was playing "He Lives With You" from the 
Lion King in bluegrass.  And there was something in so many ways that was wrong about that, 
but my brain, when the rest of me wasn't paying attention, knew the music and started seeing 
spotlights and actors on stage. I could still run that show, to the music.   
 
0:52:43.1 DF: What goes into muscle memory for you? Are there any jobs where you rely on 
muscle memory?   
 
Washington State Workers 
afc2012/032
12
0:52:48.8 Coiling cable. (DF: what's the trick to coiling cable?)  SM: Wrist and thumb twist! And 
paying attention to the cable. A lot of times the cable has a memory because it's been coiled in 
a certain direction, and sometimes you pick up one end of it and you look at which way it wants 
to curl. So you start with that. Sometimes you're out of luck because it's been in a truck coming 
over the Rockies, and it's frozen stiff and doesn't want to uncurl and lay flat on the floor. Or curl 
in the direction you want it to. Sometimes it's a fight!  
 
0:53:25.2 DF: What's one of the biggest challenges you've had doing a job for a show, besides 
climbing to the follow spot?   
 
0:53:44.7 Sometimes the biggest challenge is moving really larges pieces off a stage really fast 
in the dark in your average rock show, where you have to get a riser off the stage over your 
head. And I'm short. So sometimes it's just moving big things fast. Janet Jackson. Janet Jackson 
did a tour and they had some two-story, brushed aluminum swoopy stair units that didn't fit on 
the ramp that we were trying to push up onto the stage. And they're towering over us, and 
they're teetering off the rail of the ramp because they're wider than the ramp. So it was sort of 
catty-corner on the ramp. Getting it up on there and not fall off and kill anybody and get it back 
down in the middle of the show and not kill anybody. . . That was scary! That was like, 
"Somebody's gonna die!" Fortunately, no one did. But it was a challenge. Sometimes it's just 
trying to make the cue happen, because it's just split-second timing, and it has to happen just—
Right. Exactly. There. Or everything else goes south. If we do our job right, no one knows we're 
there.  
 
0:55:17.5 If we do our job right, we aren't seen, we aren't heard, things go on time, things go 
where they're supposed to, and nobody knows it.  They just get to enjoy the show.  
 
0:55:27.9 DF: and what happens when you don't do your job right? What's an example of . . . 
things didn't work, and you had to think on your feet. 
 
0:55:44.3 Sometimes technology goes awry, and sometimes that moving light that's supposed 
to be moving isn't. Lion King. Top of the show, Spotlights are on. There are a lot of moving lights 
downstage. There are supposed to be moving lights, moving and turning and lighting the area. 
One night the moving lights didn't work. So all of a sudden we're having to figure out where on 
stage we're supposed to spotlight action where we've never had to spotlight before. So the 
audience can see. While the moving light technician is climbing up the ladder behind me and 
standing on the rails of my platform over my head resetting the moving light controller that's 
out on the truss ahead of me. Suddenly, it's like, Okay!  We don't have lights, and we have to 
make sure that this thing that's happening right now can still get seen! That was thinking on 
your feet. That was technology. Sometimes automation doesn't work and the staircase that's 
supposed to be coming in automatically doesn't come in, and the stagehands have to push it 
out. And we wind up getting seen!  And the audience goes, "Why look! I wonder if they were 
supposed to do that?"  
 
Washington State Workers 
afc2012/032

0:57:02.2 Years and years ago there was a mistake and the stagehand was caught on stage 
doing some work, and somebody in the audience was sitting in front of me and they went, 
"Look! Look!" And our friend said, "That wasn't a mistake!  They NEVER make mistakes!" And I 
thought, Wow. We've got them fooled. That was an interesting perspective. The hardest judges 
are always the other technicians. A lot of times it's hard to lose yourself in a performance when 
you're in the audience because you're watching the lighting, and you're watching the spots, and 
you're, "Oh, that spot over there on the stage is really dark.  Hmmm. This lighting designer, not 
so. . ." You wind up critiquing the technical elements. Sometimes you have to figure out how to 
turn that off and just enjoy the show.  
 
0:57:56.0 DF: Are there any stories that have been told to you that are cautionary tales? You 
need to pay attention to this because this was what happened one time to so-and-so. . ."  
 
0:58:13.3 There was a story about a stagehand who got ratchet-strapped to the wall of a truck 
because he was talking too much. But those were the old days. Those were seriously the old 
days. There are some very colorful old stagehands in this local, and a lot of stories, but I can't 
do them justice.  
 
0:58:42.6 DF: Are there any sayings that are clear among you that it's really specific to being a 
stagehand? Anything that would have to do with safety, or before a show, or any superstitions?  
 
0:59:04.8 Not so much for stagehands. Most of the superstitions are for actors. Actors are a 
very superstitious lot. Much like professional athletes. They're the ones who are most 
superstitious. For example, the "break a leg" instead of wishing anyone good luck. Everyone 
knows that. Stagehands, not so much. We talk about being tired and taking extra work, and one 
of the sayings in the groups is, "Well, that's okay. We'll sleep when we die." That's a common 
one among stagehands when we take more work. "Yeah, well, it's okay. I'll sleep when I die." 
Because the work is there when it's there, and if you don't take it, you don't know when the 
next work will be. Or, like right now, you know that after mid-December there's not going to be 
anything until late January. A really slow month coming up, so you take everything you can get.  
 
1:00:04.9 There's going to be a really crazy week coming up next week. Tuesday we have the 
Deck the Hall Ball at the Key Arena, which is a big rock Christmas show with many rock bands 
doing a huge performance. They do it every year, one of the local radio stations sponsors that. 
Followed by Pearl Jam. Pearl Jam's local guys, but they're local guys made big and big. Followed 
immediately by WWE for two days (World Wrestling Entertainment). They had to switch their 
name to Entertainment from Federation because, well, the World Wildlife Federation objected 
to them using WWF for one, and it's entertainment. They're the nicest guys to work with.  They 
have the best catering on the planet--they feed wrestlers really, really well! And we benefit 
from that. They feed us really well. They have a really great crew. The wrestlers are really nice 
guys. So we'll have wrestling for two days. That will be followed by Maclemore and Lewis, a 
local rapper made good, for three days. So there's a whole stretch of seven days where 
everybody will be working really crazy hours. Then it slows up.

1:01:27.3 DF What's the most unusual call you've ever had?   
 
1:01:29.9 Most unusual call I ever had as a dispatcher was to find somebody with an 18" waist 
who had to wear a costume as a stagehand for the opera, TONIGHT. No, 20" waist. So I had to 
call women and ask them their waist size.  And can you be at work tonight and for the next four 
weeks? That was the most unusual call I ever filled. Most unusual call I've done as a stagehand 
was setting up dressing rooms for Tim McGraw at the Key Arena. That's not usually work we do, 
that's usually done by some other people. We don't usually get into the dressing rooms and set 
up for the talent. Finding out what goes into the dressing rooms and what all those 
entertainment riders entail--that was unusual. The most unusual thing in the job was the three 
bars that were under the stage. Because it was a night with the guys, and some people got to 
go under the stage and got to drink during the show. And as a consequence, they had a little 
Porta-Potty down there. Because, if you're on stage for 2-1/2 hours, and you're drinking, you 
might need a break!  
 
1:02:55.0 DF: Is there anything that you think I as an interviewer need to know or that you 
would like to say as part of this interview to talk about your work? And give me the name of 
your local.   
 
1:03:16.8 It's IATSE, Local 15. International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees. International 
because we also cover Canada.  DF: It's 15 because. . . SM? We're the fifteenth local to be 
chartered.  Well ahead of Los Angeles, which is 33, and sadly ahead of San Francisco, which is 
16. They don't like being 16. We were the fifteenth local chartered. And the first one on the 
West Coast. If you look at the locals, they come out through Chicago and Minneapolis. And 
we're the first one on the West Coast.  
 
1:04:01.1 DF: Would you recommend this job?  
 
1:04:04.4 I love this job, but it is physically challenging, it is hard, it is a job that plays havoc with 
sleep patterns and social lives. You find out you have friends that can accept the "Yes I can 
make plans unless I have work," unless they can't and they tend to fall by the wayside over the 
years because if they can't understand the complexities of "I have to work when there's work. . 
." When I was first starting out, and I was trying to get my first hundred hours, I always had my 
stage blacks in the car. I always had my work clothes in the car. I always had my tools. I was 
always prepared to take that emergency call from dispatch saying, "Hey, can you go to work?" 
And I was going out with a friend one day to go shopping, and we were pulling out of her 
driveway and the phone rang from dispatch and they said, "Can you go to work?" And I pulled 
back in and said, "Bye!" She got out and I went to work at the Paramount and did a magic show. 
That's the way it is sometimes. You make plans, and they get thrown right out the window.  
 
Your social life is planned around the fact that most theaters are dark on Monday nights. It's 
hard. You have to be able to live with economic uncertainty. You have to be able to budget. You 
have to be flexible. It's a lot of fun. It's rewarding to take those 16 semis of stuff and put it all 
together and have a concert and send it on the road to Portland. And do it all safely and have 
Washington State Workers 
afc2012/032
15
an audience that enjoys their show. And have a road crew that leaves happy. That's also part of 
what's fun. If you can make your road guys happy. Because they're out there day in and day 
out, just going from city to city and dealing with sometimes union people, sometimes nonunion 
people. Sometimes they roll in and go, "Oh, my god, last night!" And you try to make it better. 
And that's also fun. The guys I worked with last night at the Paramount had had a hard time in 
Vancouver the night before, some things that didn't get done. People who didn't put things 
where they told them to, or took things apart they weren't supposed to. And, yeah. If you are 
on the schedule where you have to load this in today, do a show, load it out, people have to pay 
attention. When the road guy says, "Don't take apart these things!" it's a really good thing not 
to take them apart because they don't have TIME to put them all back together. So they have to 
do a lot of work that says, "Do not break," "Do not untape." And they use a lot of tape so that 
you know, that's supposed to stay together. Some people get it, some people don't.  
 
1:06:57.4 Sometimes they work in college towns where they have college labor who haven't 
done professional work. Sometimes they get labor that comes from Labor Ready--people 
who've never done this work. And it shows. They have to be ready to work with a wide range of 
skills. The road guys have to be able to deal with zero skills to highly skilled. And not fall apart. 
Not implode. They have got to be able to deal with a huge range of ability and still get their 
show done. So we are a very good local. We get work done, usually, faster than expected, 
particularly on commercial work or industrial work, conference work. We tend to get shows 
loaded in and out faster than a lot of other unions or a lot of other locations. We're a good local 
for riggers. We have the guys here who really pioneered and refined entertainment rigging, 
wrote the book on entertainment rigging. We had, when they first started doing rigging 
certification, we had the most certified riggers in the country. New York outranks us now for 
the most, but not by much. It's a good union. Good folks. You work with a lot of different 
people, people with a lot of different personalities. Some you like, some you don't. You're there 
to do a job and you have to cooperate because that's the only way you're going to be safe, and 
that's the only way you're going to get it done.  
 
It's a challenge in many, many ways. You stand backstage and watch the ballet and see it from 
the side when you're doing Don Quixote, you see the Nutcracker and you know all the bits and 
pieces that go together. And it's fun knowing it. It's fun being part of it, and it's fun having 
audiences enjoy it. It's a lot of fun to do a Broadway show for Shrek and send it to Broadway 
and have it win awards. Or Memphis. Or Hairspray. Or Young Frankenstein. Those all came out 
of here. Being part of that, and watching our friends we've worked with go on to Broadway and 
get awards for it. That's kinda nice!  Yeah, I knew them!  
 
1:09:20.0 It's also hard when you work with, we've had some tragedies in the past few years 
with stage collapses. Usually with outdoor venues. In the past few years in the summers there 
have been some tragedies and some stagehands have died. Radiohead was here and year and a 
half ago in Seattle. We were early in their tour, and about ten days later there was an accident 
in Toronto, and the drum tech that I worked with here in Seattle died. A guy I'd worked with ten 
days earlier was dead. And again, we come back to it's a dangerous job we do.  Anything you 
want to know that I forgot?

1:10:14.2 DF: Not that I can think of. You really covered a lot of territory.  
 
1:10:22.3 It's a big territory! We do some top-secret work for some tech executives in town 
sometimes. We go out and do work at private residencies.  
 
1:10:41.3 DF: That's interesting. That I didn't know.   
 
1:10:45.7 We do. And we have to sign nondisclosure agreements saying that we won't talk 
about the family or the house or the security or any of the event. But we do private events. 
We've done, I've worked twice or three times now when the President was here. That was fun! 
Working for the President. Although you have a huge security detail, and everything has to be 
screened and rescreened and examined. And you know not to make any sudden moves 
because there's guys with guns. That's fun! President Obama did an event at the Everett Boeing 
Plant, and the event, the big photo op was him coming down the back staircase of the brand-
new 787 into the audience. It was during the last campaign. And my job was to run the 250 foot 
audio snake and crawl all the way across the hanger and up the other side of the plane and into 
the cabin under the watchful eye of the Secret Service. That was fun. Being the guy that has his 
microphone, that's fun. We did that, he was here campaigning with Patty Murray. That was at 
Heck Ed. Outside in the freezing cold. He came out first and did a small speech for the overflow 
crowd that was sitting in the stadium, and we were out there in the cold running sound for that.  
 
We do a lot of different things. We do birthday parties in private civilians' homes that have a lot 
of money. And we do events for Boeing, we do events for Microsoft. We do concerts, we do 
Broadway shows, we do decorations for Christmas. We do lighting in the trees downtown for 
Christmas! It's a lot of different work. It's all fun. It's all a lot more fun when we're not outside 
when it's raining or snowing. One of those private residence jobs was after Thanksgiving and it 
was snowing, and all of the empty cases had been stored down on the tennis court. And we had 
to push them up the ramp in the snow from the tennis court to the path and over around 
through the front garden and up the ramp into the pool house, and then back down the ramp 
around the rose, and then back up the ramp into the truck, in the snow. So actually up the hill 
in the snow both ways. It's a great job! It's a great job.  DF: Thank you! SM: You're welcome!
