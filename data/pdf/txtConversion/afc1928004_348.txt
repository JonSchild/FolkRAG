MERRY SAILOR LAD. 
Sung (in character) by Miss CLARA MOORE. 
Oh, I'm a 
merry sailor lad, 
With a 
heart both light and free; 
I 
dearly prize my gallant ship, 
I 
love the deep blue sea. 
I 
dearly prize my gallant ship, 
I 
love the deep blue sea. 
Where the bounding billows rear their heads, 
To play with the tempest cloud; 
(Hurried mu.s.ir.) 
To play with tempest cloud 
And the storm's deep voice comes o'er the main, 
In murmurs hoarse and loud. 
Oh. I'm a 
merry sailor lad, 
With a 
heart both light and free; 
I 
dearly prize my gallant ship, 
I 
love the deep blue sea; 
I 
dearly prize my gallant ship, 
I 
love the deep blue sea. 
CHORUS. 
Huzza! huzzal my heart beats glad, 
Whe would not be a 
sailor lad; 
Who would not be a 
sailor lad, 
Who would not be a 
sailor lad? 
I 
love to tread the vessel's deck, 
Amid the howling gale, 
And listen to the sea gulls' scream, 
And to the thunder's wail. 
And to the thunder's wail, 
And to the thunder's wail. 
(Hurried flash music.) 
And watch the vivid lightning play 
Around me bold and free, 
Around me bold and free. 
Oh, some may love the dull tame shore, 
But an ocean life for me. 
Oh, I'm a 
merry sailor lad, 
With a 
heart both light and free, 
I 
dearly prize my gallant ship, 
I 
love the deep blue sea; 
I 
dearly prize my gallant ship, 
I 
love the deep blue sea. 
THE WATER MILL, 
A Poem recited by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
Listen to the water- mill, all the livelong day, 
How the creaking of the wheel wears the hours away; 
Languidly the water glides—ceaseless on and still— 
Never coming back again to that water-mill. 
And the proverb haunts my mind, as the spell is cast— 
The mill will never grind again with the water that has passed. 
Take the lesson to yourself, loving hearts and true, 
Golden years are paFsing by, youth is passing, too; 
Try to make the most of life, lose no honest way, 
All that you can call your own lies in this—to- day. 
Power, intellect and strength may not, cannot last, 
The mill will never grind again with tie water that has passed. 
Oh, the wasted hours of life that have fleeted by, 
Oh, the good we might have done, lost without a 
sigh; 
Love that once we might have saved with but a 
single word, 
Thoughts conceived, but not expressed—perishing unheard. 
Take the lesson to your heart, take, oh ! hold it fast, 
The mill will never grind again with the water that has passed. 
SIXTY-TWO. 
Time with an eagle wing flies on 
And I 
am left alone; 
Where are the friends of early youth? 
Sweet echo answers gone. 
They be married, every one of them, 
As well as I 
would wish to do; 
In years gone by I 
was a 
gem, 
To- day I'm sixty-two. 
CHORUS. 
I'm sixty—two, 
I'm sixty,— sixty—Two. 
Now young men, a 
word to you, 
Ah, you this chance refuse, 
I've no objections to say yes, 
If you will pop the choose. 
ie bachelors of middle age, 
Let me propose to you, 
No more delay, your wedding day, 
You'll soon he sixty two. 
Descriptively sung by CLARA MOORE. 
Let the farmer praise his grounds, 
As the huntsman his hounds, 
And the shepherd his sweet-scented lawn, 
While I 
more blessed than they, 
Spend each happy night and day, 
With my smiling little cruiskeen lawn; 
Lawn, lawn, lawn, 
With my smiling little cruiskeen lawn. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, linth asue the cruiskeen, 
Shlani the ga mavourneen, 
Gra machree ma cruiskeen, 
Lawn. lawn, lawn, 
Gra machree, me cruiskeen, lawn. 
Then fill your glasses high, 
Never toast with lips so dry, 
Till the cock does awake in the morn. 
And if you can't remain, 
May we shortly rneet again, 
And we we'll take another cruiskeen, 
Lawn, lawn, lawn; 
And we'll take another cruiskeen lawn. 
Oh, linthe asue, etc. 
And when grim death appears, 
After many happy years, 
And tells me that my race is run, 
I'll say, begone, you slave, 
For great Bacchus gave me lave, 
Just to take another cruiskeen, 
Lawn, lawn, lawn; 
Just to take another cruiskeen lawn. 
Oh, linthe asue, etc. 
THE APPLE WOMAN'S LAMENT. 
As sung by CLARA MOORE. 
My young mon was a 
shanus born, 
A 
grand piano tuner, 
But he ran away from me one day, 
On board of Meery Schooner, 
And left me here, heart broken; 
When I 
would rather sooner 
Have sold off my old apple stand, 
I 
had upon the corner. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, his name was Bill, a 
granite chap, 
Oh, wouldn't I 
like to find him; 
But he's o'er the sea, awa' from me, 
And the lassie left behind him. 
his stockings he stood six foot three, 
I've a 
likeness in a 
locket, 
And a 
little piece of curly hair 
I 
cut from his whiskers, in in 
pocket. 
He'd made a 
clever policeman, 
But he's gone off like a 
rocket, 
And left me with my apple stand, 
Still standing on the corner. 
Oh, his name, etc. 
I'm scudding under bare poles now, 
My own sad fate bewailing, 
And thinking of the night, alas! 
We parted at the railing. 
And when he swore upon his ' baeca box, 
Before the ship was sailing, 
By his bulwarks, stanchions, jibs and booms, 
He would be true to me. 
Oh, his name, etc.

Yeo ho, lads! ho! yeo ho! yeo hot 
There's none like Nancy Lee, I 
trow, 
Yeo ho, lads! ho! yeo ho! 
See there she stands and waves her hands, 
Upon the quay; 
And every day, when I'm away, 
She'll watch f6r me; 
And whisper low, when tempests blow, 
For Jack at sea. 
Yeo ho, lads! ho! yeo ho! 
CHORUS. 
The sailor's wife, the sailor's star shall be; 
Yeo ho I

THE LITTLE TIN SOLDIER. 
AS WE PROMENADE DOWN BROADWAY. 
Words by F. E. 
W EATHERLY. 
Music by J. L. MoLLOY. 
As sung by CLARA MOORE. 
E. H. HARDING, 229 Bowery, New York. 
Price 10 cents. 
He was a 
little tin soldier, 
One little leg had he ; 
She was a 
little fairy dancer, 
Bright as bright could be; 
She had a 
eastle and garden, 
He but an old box dim; 
She was a 
dainty rose love, 
Far too grand for him. 
CHORUS. 
He was a 
little tin soldier, 
One little leg had he; 
Bravely he shouldered his musket, 
Fain her love would be; 
Ne'er in the world a 
lover, 
Half so true could be. 
Once as he watched his rose love. 
Winds from the north did blow, 
Swept him out of the casement, 
Down to a 
stream below; 
True to his little lady, 
Still he shouldered his gun; 
Soon, ah! soon came the darkness, 
Life and love undone. 
He was a 
little, etc. 
Once more he sees his rose love, 
Still she is dancing gay; 
He is worn and faded, 
Loyal still for aye. 
Then came a 
hand that swept,them 
Into a 
furnace wide, 
Parted in life, in dying 
They are side by side. 
CHORUS. 
Ah, for the little tin soldier! 
Ah. for her cruel part! 
There lies her rose in ashes, 
There his loyal little heart. 
Written for JEPPE and FANNIE DELA.NO. 
Words and Music by JOHN T. 
RUTLEDCE. 
ka—In life there's nothing nicer than 
To be a 
dashing swell, 
To flirt with all the pretty girls, 
And court the fairest belle. 
Now I 
have got a 
sweetheart, 
She's the sweetest girl I 
know; 
And I 
am called the nobby chap, 
In every place I 
go. 
CHORUS. 
As we promenade down Broadway, 
The people smile and say, 
A 
nobby pair are they 
Who ever they may be. 
We're happy then you know, 
Each a 
captivating beau; 
Our fashions all we show, 
When coming from the matinee. 
Lady.—I'm always full of life you know, 
And like to have my fun, 
I 
like to flirt with gay young men, 
As well as any one. 
I 
like to promenade the street, 
With Gussey by my side; 
While some, with eager glances look 
The love they cannot hide. 
As we promenade, etc. 
Lady.-0, Gussy, dear, why did you stay 
Away so long, my dear; 
I've waited for an hour or more, 
My heart was tilled with fear. 
Gent—I 
would have been here sooner, love, 
With something sweet to say, 
But then you know I 
had to take 
A promenade down Broadway. 
As we promenade, etc,

THE OLD VILLAGE SCHOOL ON THE 
GREEN, 
Written by FRANK VAN HESS for ED. BURTON, and sung by him 
with great success. 
Oh! I 
love the bright days of my youth to review, 
And fancy again I'm a 
boy, 
With my merry companions so faithful and true, 
And friendship that knows no alloy. 
Oh ! the thoughts I 
review as I 
ponder the past, 
Recalling each dear youthful scene; 
The one I 
most prize, and will love to the last, 
Is the old village school on the green. 
(Repeat two last lines.) 
Near the old village school the cottage still stands, 
Where I 
first saw the dawn of light; 
And now over its porch in rich clustering bands, 
The roses are blooming as bright 
As ' twas when with garlands and wreaths of wild flowers, 
We joyously crowned our May Queen, 
And told childish love tales in neat little bowers, 
Near the old village school on the green. 
(Repeat two last lines.) 
I 
have left many dear and some loved ones behind 
To rest as I've journeyed along; 
There are others remain just as faithful and kind, 
To join ii! the laugh and the song; 
And when I 
am called by grim death to prepare, 
I 
will answer with spirit serene, 
If they'll lay me to rest when I 
breathe my last prayer, 
Near the old village school on the green. 
(Repeat two last lines) 
My grandfather said that of those he could hire, 
Not a 
servant so faithful he found; 
For it wasted no time, and had but one desire— 
At the close of each week to be wound. 
It was kept in its place, not a 
frown upon its face, 
And its hands never hung by its side ; 
But it stopped short—never to go again— 
When the old man died. 
Ninety years, etc. 
It rang an alarm in the dead of the night— 
An alarm that for years had been dumb : 
And we knew that his spirit was pluming for flight— 
That his hour of departure had come. 
Still the clock kept the time, with a 
soft and muffled chime, 
As we silently stood by his side ; 
But it stopped short—never to go again— 
When the old man died. 
Ninety years, etc. 
THEY ALL DO IT. 
Written and composed by JOIIN READ. 
Arranged by H. W. Fmnrrr. 
Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Copyright, 1877, by E. II. HARDING, 229 Bowery, opposite 
Prince St., N. Y. 
Price 10 cents. 
Some folks will cry " Oh! shame, Mrs. Jones, you are to blame, 
I 
never should have thought it, ma'am, of you," 
While, if they'd look at home before abroad they'd roam, 
I'm positive they'd have enough to do. 
Mrs. Brown says it's a 
sin, that Mrs. Smith drinks gin, 
And harbors " 
from day to day; 
While Mrs. Green was caught doing what she hadn't ought, 
When she in self defencs was heard to say— 
CHORUS. 
" 
They all do it, they all do it, 
They all do it, though ofttimes they rue it; 
Yet they all do it, they all do it, 
And so it will continue to the end of the world!" 
For hours three or four, lovers spooning at the door, 
On any moonlight evening may be seen; 
Though if they want a 
lark, they have it in the dark, 
And they " do it," though they say " they didn't mean," 
When creeping down the stairs, comes the old man unawares, 
And kissing catch the couple in the act ; 
The mother, from above, says " Don't interfere, my love, 
You can't dispute this most important fact—" 
They all do it, etc. 
Old women do declare, girls should never dye their hair, 
And then again they say it's very wrong; 
Without the least restraint, their faces so to paint, 
And rob the easy chair for their chignon. 
Each girl a 
little puff, has inside a 
little muff, 
They are never seen without it, night or day; 
And her pretty nose she'll powder, if a 
moment is allowed her, 
When, if you laugh, she'll innocently say— 
They all do it, etc, 
But what does most impress, is the style in which they dress, 
It's enough to make you laugh when them you see; 
They've a 
hat upon thAr heads, large enough to make up beds, 
For pussy cats with kittens two or three. 
In their panniers, too, behind, if examined you would find, 
The most important papers of the day; 
The Chronicle and Chimes, the Telegraph and Times, 
Or anything that chance puts in their way. 
They all do it, etc. 
There's my neighbor, Dinah Down, brught two lovely boys to 
town, 
And her husband gets but one pound one per week; 
You often hear him say, " If things go on this way, 
We'll a 
lodging in the Union have to seek 
For the doctor and the nurse, will drain my scanty purse, 
With many more expenses to defray;" 
Then lie gets into a 
passion, when they tell him " it's the 
fashion," 
And they soothe him as they sing this truthful lay— 
They all do it, etc.

As sung by GUS. W ILLIAMS. 
Music published and Copyright by FREDIC 
BLUME, 27 Union 
Square. 
When I'm dead and gone from you, darling, 
When I'm laid away in my grave, 
When my spirit has gone to heaven above, 
To him who my soul will save. 
When you are happy and gay once more, 
Thinking of the days that have been, 
There's one little wish I 
ask of you, 
See that my grave's kept green. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the days will come to you, darling, 
When on earth no more I'll be seen, 
One sweet little wish, darling, grant me, 
See that my grave's kept green. 
Will you keep me, love in remembrance, 
When the voice of chiding is heard, 
When other's may speak in censure or blame, 
Speak not one unkindly word. 
inen you are happy and gay once more, 
Thinking of the days that have been, 
There's one little wish I 
ask of you, 
See that my grave's kept green. 
Oh, the days will come, etc.

HOPE I

Written by W, If. DELEHANTY. 
Performed by DET.EHANTY & HENGLER 
I'm as happy as the day is long, 
My mind is never easy, 
No matter whether right or wrong, 
You must not think me rude. 
For love it is the burden of my song, 
With joy I'm almost crazy; 
And if perchance I 
sing or dance, 
You must not think me rude, 
And if I 
make fine little break, 
I 
hope I 
don't intrude. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, dear, don't you wish that you was me, (spa.) 
I 
feel just as happy as a 
big bumble-bee, 
(
sym.) 
I 
was walking by her door, 
When I 
heard the music sweet, 
And my heart with joy filled over, 
I 
couldn't keep ray feet. 
So keep the music ringing, 
For it makes me feel so good; 
And if, perchance, I 
sing or dance, 
You must not think me rude. 
And if I 
make one little break, 
I 
hope I 
don't intrude. 
(
Dance.) 
At a 
fancy ball the other night, 
Myself and little Daisy, 
We kept it up till broad daylight, 
We felt so awful good. 
Oh, Daisy looked so fair and bright, 
She set the men all crazy; 
And if they asked her tor to dance, 
She'd ask me it she could, 
Arid then I'd say in a 
carelRqs way-

hope I 
don't intrude. 
Oh, dear, etc.

Cno:—Den shouting, &c. 
Sung by LIZZIE BRAHAM. 
Of all the girls in this wide world, 
There's none can equal Flo, 
Her home is in a 
shady dell, 
Down where the brambles grow. 
She is the darling of my heart, 
Her beauty's quite divine, 
And in about a 
month or so 
She's going to be mine. 
CHORUS. 
Down in the dell where the brambles grow, 
Every night I 
to ramble go, 
Kissing and squeezing my darling Flo, 
Down in the dell where the brambles grow. 
She cannot boast of untold wealth, 
Nor yet of noble blood, 
But she can boast a 
loving heart, 
And everything that's good. 
Her parents keep a 
little farm, 
And every night I 
go, 
Sweet tales to tell this charming belle, 
Down wkere the brambles grow. 
Though she's a 
simple country lass, 
I 
love her as my life, 
And all my hopes will be complete 
When she becomes my wife; 
For when my darling smiles on me, 
My heart seems in a 
glow, 
It is so sweet that girl to meet, 
Down where the brambles grow. 
Music by CHARLES E. PRAT% 
Dedicated to HENRY F.

Air—" Put My Little Shoes Away." 
Thou hest learned to love another, 
Thou bast broken every vow, 
We have parted from each other, 
And my heart is lonely now; 
I 
have taught my looks to shun thee, 
When coldly we have met, 
For another's smile bath won thee, 
And thy voice I 
must forget. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, is it well to sever 
This heart from thine forever? 
Can I 
forget thee--never I 
Farewell, farewell forever. 
We have met in scenes of pleasure, 
We have met in halls of pride, 
I 
have seen thy new-found treasure, 
I 
have gazed upon thy bride; 
I 
have marked the timid lustre 
Of thy downcast happy eye, 
I 
have seen thee gaze upon her, 
Forgetting I 
was by. 
CHORrS. 
I 
grieve that e'er I 
met thee, 
Fain, fain, would I 
forget thee, 
Shall I 
forget thee—never! 
Farewell, farewell forever. 
We have met and we have parted, 
But I 
uttered scarce a 
word, 
Like a 
guilty thing I 
started, 
When thy well-known voice I 
heard; 
Thy looks were stern and altered, 
And thy words were cold and high, 
How my traitor courage faltered 
When I 
dared to meet thine eye. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, woman's love will grieve her, 
And woman's pride will leave her, 
Life has fled when love deceives her, 
Farewell, farewell forever.

Close the shutters—Willie's dead,

Like a

From our home, now sad and drear; 
When the spring-time flowers were blooming, 
And the happy birds sung sweet, 
Angels called him to their home, 
Up in Heaven where we shall meet.

From our home, now sad and lot

Gone in childhood's bloom— 
Pillow'd now his little head 
In the cold and silent tomb. 
O'er his grave the daisies blossom,

And the murm'ring streamlet plays 
'Neath the willow's quiet shade.

Darling, linger at my side, 
While the moments by us glide; 
Time and care have marked your brow,

Love but gleams with brighter glow; 
Sweeter far than gems untold,

Beaming eyes that gaze in mine, 
Ah! how fondly now they shine! 
Roses of the heart remain, 
Though they fade on hill and plain! 
Loving ones cannot forget 
Happy days when first they met; 
Fondly now each tress of gold, 
Silver hair that once was gold. 
Down the hill, Ix 
Life together we will share, 
Every joy and every care; 
'Till we slumber side by side, 
In the church-yard drear and wide!

Fairer than in days of old, 
Silver hair that once was gold.

A 
WONDERFUL WORLD, 
As sung by LIZZIE BRAHMA. 
What a 
wonderful world we are in to be sure, 
What a 
babel of bustle and strife, 
And all! what a 
burden some have to endure, 
As they journey the rough road of life: 
The strongest may push to a 
prosperous end, 
While the weak and unsteady may fall, 
But no matter my friend, how we finish depend, 
Old Adam was father of all. 
ClIORL'S. 
Then never despair though ye have not a 
share, 
Of the riches that round you may fall, 
But be to each other like sister and brother, 
For Adam was father of all. 
31 
One man may be lucky and rolling in wealth, 
Being born to his ancestors' gains, 
While another may only have honor and health, 
And a 
cranium crammed full of brains; 
But health isn't bought, nor is happiness sold, 
So a 
man shouldn't merit despise, 
For a 
sorrow may come to the lordliest home, 
And a 
joy for the lowly may rise. 
Then never despair, Sce. 
No wonder that some men are born to command, 
While others seem born to obey, 
For one man will hold all he earns to his hand, 
And another will cast it away; 
But make the best use of your talents and time, 
And fortune may give you a 
call, 
For despite of our creed, we are all of a 
breed, 
And Adam was father of all. 
Then never despair, tte.

I'm the father of a 
bouncing girl, 
With cheeks like cherries red; 
She's a

I'm only twelve months wed. 
When I 
come home from labor 
After toiling all the day, 
Me wife puts Nelly in me arms, 
And this to to me did say— 
CHORUS, 
Arrah Patrick mind the baby, 
Arrah can't you mind the child! 
Tie it up in an over- coat, 
She's surely going wild. 
Arrah Patrick mind the baby, 
Mind the child awhile! 
She'll kick and bite, 
And cry all night, 
Arrah Patrick mind the child. 
There was castor-oil, and soothing syrup, 
And paregoric to, 
Was give to the child when she had fits, 
But nothing would bring her to; 
She'd put mustard plasters on her feet, 
And give her a 
bowl of tea, 
And then she'd lay her in my arms, 
And this to me would say— 
Arrah Patrick mind the baby, U. 
Ah when Nelly grew up to a 
lady, 
I 
had no control at tall; 
She'd say I 
am no baby, 
As she waltz away to a

WHAT THE OLD COCK SPARROW SAIb, 
As sung by FRANK LEWIS with immense applause. 
One day I 
took a 
walk, rambling thro' the Central Park, 
It was at the close of a 
bright Autumn day, 
To enjoy the evening breeze as it swift sped thro' the trees, 
And watch the fountain's water brightly play. 
After walking once around, a 
rustic bench I 
found, 
And sitiing (Iowa a 
moment just to rest, 
When a 
voice I 
heard above, saying ' Soon to you I'll prove 
That honesty of purpose is the best.' 
As I 
looked up with surprise, a 
strange sight met my eyes, 
Some fifty sparrows gathered o'er my head; 
A 
big cock sparrow spoke, with age his feathers broke, 
And this was what the old cock sparrow said. 
" ' Tis strange such things to hear, we are getting worse each 
year, 
The laboring man now cannot get a 
meal, 
About fifty cents a 
day is all they earn for pay, 
It's no wonder that the poor man has to steal. 
And our parsons do not preach, or longer virtue teach, 
At secret kissing they are most expert; 
And our politicians all for their living shout 
bawl, 
And talk of nothing but that bloody shirt. 
And our lecturers who roam, like naughty men from home, 
Through sleeping cars in dreams be blindly led, 
Like Tilton, sweet to furl his arms 'round some pretty girl!" 
This was part of what the old cock sparrow said. 
" 
To the aemagogues who dare talk again of civLI war, 
On the Fourth of March 'twill be all right, I 
sa.. 
Boss Tweed is back again from that dirty land called Spain, 
And I 
hope that in confinement he'll not stay. 
For. supposing lie did rob, no poor man wanted a 
job, 
lie took it from the rich to give the poor! 
37 
I'd rather run the risk, be ruled by men like him and Fisk, 
For then no beggars hungered at your door. 
Of such things soon we'll tire, look at the great Brooklyn fire; 
They condemned the theatres—when the folks were dead! 
Had they done it but before, we should not the fire deplore"— 
This was part of what the old cock sparrow said. 
"In the election long since gone, none knows which man has 
won, 
They did the " counting" just themselves to please; 
Let Returning Boards act fair, and do things on the- square, 
And we care not if it's Tilden or it's Hayes. 
But one thing ve must see, in this land so great and free, 
That work in plenty shall be got for all; 
And the scoundrels who would lower the wages of the poor, 
How quickly we will send them to tbe wall!" 
At this a 
shout did rise, which ascended to the skies, 
From the sparrows that did flutter o'er my head ; 
They said his words were right, as they flew into the night, 
And they voted all the old cock sparrow said.

Grandpa's chair is vacant, 
Near the fire in the grate; 
Where he told his tales of boyhood, 
Kept the little ones awake. 
One eve, so worn and weary, 
Sleeping on his knee they lay, 
Death called that night, like the fire bright, 
Grandpa passed away. 
CHORUS. 
So let the room be cheerful, 
Place the old arm chair 
Where we talked to -Grandpa, 
With his silvery snow white hair. 
How he'd watch the falling ashes, 
And sadly meditate, 
Gently sigh, we all must die, 
Like the fire in the grate. 
One bitter night in winter, 
The snow fell fast and wild; 
A 
girl looked in the window, 
A 
careworn, hapless child; 
Then Grandpa whispered " baby," 
And toddled to the gate, 
To save from sin, he brought her in, 
Near the fire in the grate. 
So let the room, etc. 
Keep the fire burning, 
'Tis charity's bright flame; 
Reminding of the evening 
The orphan Mary came, 
So ragged, cold and hungry, 
With Grandpa from the gate; 
For him she kneels, a 
prayer she yields, 
Near the fire in the grate. 
So let the room, etc.

O'ER THE HILLS AND DALES SO GRAND. 
Written by E. DAviEs, expresely for JENNIE HUGHES. 
I 
CAME from dear Old Ireland, with very little money, 
I 
crossed the great big ocean, the Yankee folks to see, 
I've heard of great big wonders, but very few I've seen now, 
So if you'll wait, why I'll relate, the wonders which I've seen. 
Of the hills and dales so grand, that's seen in Paddy's land, 
The boys and girls of our dear Isle, so beautiful to see, 
Driving on a 
jaunting car, with Paddy by my side, 
When the moon is shining brightly, along the road we glide. 
There's a 
pretty place called Dublin, 
What can equal that great city, 
For learning and for excellence 01 Enn's gallant sons, 
To the memory of departed worth, 
spake of Dan 
O'Connell. 
Emmett, Moore and Grattan tor the services these have 
done. 
There's the " Dargle " and the " Devil's Glen," in the County 
Wicklow, 
The sweet Lakes of Killarney, in Kerry County too, 
Not forgetting " Blarney Castle," you all know what I 
mean 
now, 
For there of course the boys all go, to kiss the Blarney stone. 
I 
am a 
girl of style you see, 
And everywhere I 
go, 
Some fellows always follow me 
If I 
walk fast or slow. 
Perhaps they think my heart is true, 
Or I 
have lots of cash, 
Or its cardinal red or navy blue 
I 
wear with such a 
dash. 
CHORUS. (Waltz.) 
When I 
walk out at 3 
P. M., 
To take the bracing air, 
I'm sure to meet a 
score of men, 
Always at me stare. 
I 
hear them say, I 
wonder who 
That daisy there can be, 
In the cardinal red and navy blue, 
Whom we so often see. 
some say that I'm a 
fashion plate, 
Cut from a 
magazine, 
Others, I'm a 
counterpart 
Of some young foreign queen. 
But then I 
never mind the cut. 
But go right straight ahead, 
In my cardinal red and navy blue, 
To which I'm really wed. 
When I 
walk out, etc.\

THERE is no place so gay as the ball-room, 
When we're dancing in dreamy delight, 
When the cares of the day never greet us, 
In the flush of the beautiful night, 
But the dawn puts an end to our glory, 
And the pleasure we dearly adore, 
We must part from the scene so enchanting, 
And go home looking sleepy and sore.

Oh it's all very well to be waltzing, 
And the pleasure we love to recall,

Coming home, coming home from the 
There the ladies are rivals of Venus, 
And their smiles all around us bestow, 
Ev'ry face wears a 
mantle of gladness, 
There is welcome where ever we go; 
But when morning comeir f

And we growl at the pain in our heads, 
And we third: we were foolish for (lancing,

SPOKEN.—That is just how it is. 
It's all very fine while it

Some body else will yawn out very loud,

Another will complain of

And when we contemplate all this we 
naturally say to ourselves,

SPOKEN.—Yes, we must all say good-bye at last, while we

Music by 11-ANSI:MACNEIL 
And sung by Miss At 
WR.Ar. 
I'M thinking now of olden times, 
When you and I 
were young, 
Of the school- house porch where oft we played, 
The many songs we sung ; 
The small green plot before the door. 
Where oft we skipped and run ; 
In childhood's merry happy days, 
When you and I 
were young. 
Of the village church whose silver- chimes, 
Re-echoed through the dell, 
The moss-grown rock Of olden times, 
That stood beside the well; 
The creeping ivy evergreen, 
To the ruined mill it hung, 
In childhood's merry happy days, 
When you and I 
were young. 
The village church has passed away, 
The bells no more resound, 
The ivy from the ruined mill 
Lies scattered on the ground ; 
The school-house porch, where oft we played, 
With laughter, how it rung. 
Is changed, alas, like everything, 
since you and I 
were young. 
UNDER THE ROSE BUSH. 
Sung vith great success by Miss CARRIE DUNCAN. at Tony Pas-
tor's theatre. 
WHEN- eighteen years old, and just growing bold 
Of me cupid made quite a 
happy young bride 
By shooting his dart through, and sending my heart to 
A gentleman stranger, whom I 
had espied 
Reclining at leisure, enjoying his pleasure 
Beneath the light rose-bush full burdened with bloom 
o 
kindly he pressed me, and gently addressed me 
Remarking, look here, miss, there's plenty of room. 
cnoars. 
Under the rose-bush, under the rose-bush, 
Picking the clover and picking the way, 
Under the rose-bush, under the rose- bush, 
He asked me to kiss him, I 
did not say nay. 
Of modesty heedless, in fact it. was needless, 
We sat by the side of that May-bedecked hedge, 
heard his confession of love and depression, 
He asked for a 
kiss in exchange for the pledge, 
I 
never denied it, but then and there tried it, 
Beneath that bright-rose bush full burdened with bloom, 
So like the May flowers, which served as a 
bower, 
It seemed quite as sweet as the lovely perfume. 
Under the rose-bush, ke. 
At sun's early dawning, I 
went there each morning 
To meet my romantic and strangely met swain, 
All mystery was banished, all secrecy vanished 
Dear Ned vowed he'd love me again and again. 
We do not like walking, we much prefer talking 
Beneath that bright rose-bush, full burdened with bloom, 
So when to the altar I 
went without falter 
I 
had my dear Ned jor a 
happy bridegroom.

HEY! WHAT WYE SAY? 
Written and sung by SAM DEVERE. 
No matter where, you're bound to hear 
This funny expression, it's very queer, 
From morning till night, it rings in your ear, 
Hey! what d'ye say. 
Its all over town, ' tis here, 'tis there, 
In every mouth, its everywhere, 
The people are mad, its in the air, 
Hey! what d'ye say. 
You ask a 
boy to black your boots, 
If lie thinks you're broke, makes two or three snoots, 
Then says, as around the corner he scoots, 
Hey! what d'ye say. 
Its yelled in boats, hotels and cars, 
By tough young fellows, with bad segars, 
You'll hear it whispered in all the bars, 
Hey! what d'ye say. 
The woods are full, its on the trees, 
Its blown along on every breeze, 
The bloods yell too, when out on sprees, 
Hey! what d'ye say. 
I 
asked a 
gal at Beethoven Hall, 
To give me her number, I'd make her a 
call, 
She yelled as loud as she could bawl— 
Hey I 
what d'ye say?

And be heard in Kalamazoo.

Now lovers through the Telephone, 
Can have a

came from Tralee, 
I

great big tenement house, way up in Avenue 0; 
There's a 
family lives next to me that keeps up a 
tetrible roar, 
About Eileen Alanna and their augus asthore. 
First their youngest boy, and then their eldest brother, 
All join in the chorus with the sister and his mother; 
When I 
get home at night, boys, I 
hear that terrible roar 
Of Eileen Alanna and their augus asthore. 
CHORUS. 
Working hard all day, I 
think it mighty hard, 
Climbing up a 
forty foot ladder, carrying a 
great big hod, 
When I 
get home at night, boys, to hear that terrible roar, 
Of Eileen Alanna and their augus asthore. 
Early in the morning, before I 
do get up,

Before I 
ate a 
mouthful, or before I 
drink a 
sup;

About Eileen Alanna and their augus asthore. 
If I 
had influence in the ward I 
do belong, 
I'd go and see the judge, and have him push their case quite 
strong. 
Pd have them all arrested, and that would stop their roar, 
Of Eileen Alanna and their aucrus asthore.

A 
lean banana, decayed to the core, 
E'er since I 
slipped on thy peel I've been so sorb. 
On my hack I 
lingered just where I 
fell; 
The sweet words I 
uttered would ne'er do to tell. 
If I 
could have caught then the dizzy looking gawk, 
Who threw that banana peel out on the walk. 
It made me see stars that I 
ne'er saw before, 
A lean banana I'll love thee no more. 
1st CHORUS. 
Lightly I'll tread on the sidewalk evermore, 
A 
lean banana rotten to the core; 
I 
slipped on thy' peel, I'll be careful evermore, 
A lean banana from some foreign shore. 
A 
lean banana, you've caused many a 
roar, 
I 
slipped on thy peel and you turned me o'er and o'et-
And young girls have blushed so when thrown off their pegs 
Slipping on a 
banana and showing their dear legs. 
Numerous are the pedestrians that you have caused to fall. 
Great big and little, lean, lank and tall. 
The seats of fat men's pants you've busted and you've tore. 
A lean banana, how they have swore. 
2d CHORUS. 
Watchful I 
am from the time I 
leave my door, 
A 
lean banana, I've heard of you before. 
E'er since I 
slipped on thy peel I've been so sore, 
A 
leau banana from some Dutch grocery store.

ritunapty Dumpty.—The greatest Trick Book of the Ago 
It pleases both old and young. 
It is the Fac-simile of a 
trick practised 
by all the Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and IS 
accompanied with directions so plainly written that, with a single pe-
rusal, any person may become an adept in an unfailing source of 
amusement. Read what a 
leading Journal says of it: 
"an ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order, has been sent uss 
called Baisuary Dinarry,' and bound in such a 
way as to give opportu-
nity for a 
decidedly puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary ap. 
pearauce of a 
child's picture book, gaily printed and colored, it is 
bound that a 
practised manipulator taking it up and flirting ths leave! 
over, can make it appear to be filled only with one picture, or with blank 
pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of figures. 
One minute the 
pamphlet, quickly thumbed, appears to contain nothing but the portrait 
of Harlequin, in his tesselated suit; the next only Columbine, then

With the Science and Art of Dressing with Taste. Personal beauty al.

powerful influence upon the destinies

To those who know the importance of ap-
pearing to the best advantage, whether in person or dress, this book par-

And if Nature has been sparing in bestow-
ing beauty and attractions, its suggestions will enable them to overcome 
these defects, and in nearly all cases to become, if not absolutely fasci-
nating, to become beautiful, elegant and graceful, and to be admired and 
sought after by the opposite sex. 
To those to whom Nature has been 
more liberal, attentions to the suggestions laid down here will so en-
hance their charms as to make them dangerously fascinating and sur-
passingly beautiful
