I2: 
I’m all set to go. 
I: 
Okay. You ready? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
All right. And the first thing I want to do is say thank you to you for agreeing to this interview. 
P: 
You’re welcome. 
I: 
We’re really excited to be here and privileged and thank you for the work that you do. The reason we’re 
here is because we think the work you do is very important, and we want to tell others about the work that you 
do and what it involves and the value of it. So, we’re going to start with your story. If you could share with us 
how you got into this line of work? How long you’ve been doing it, and why you keep doing it? Just tell us a 
little bit about your background. 
P: 
Okay. I first became a PCA actually in Three Rivers Hospital, in Three Rivers, Michigan. Just had 2 
weeks training [22.0]. I had been a candy striper at the hospital, and that kind of gave me interest into that field. 
And so, 25 years at the hospital. I like people. I like being able to help the patients that were in the hospital, so 
my friend started a caregiving business in 2010 after I’d retired from the hospital in 2009. And she wanted me 
to help her out, and I said, well, yeah, for the first 6 months. Well, I still have a client from her. Eight years later 
or 10 years later, so, yeah. Same client as well as others. 
I: 
Okay. And I will mention that we are outside, and we have a lovely lawn mower in the background. So, 
as much as possible if you could speak up a little bit. 
P: 
Sure. 
I: 
That’d be great. So, you were just telling us that you were in the hospital for 25 years? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And then you had a friend with a home-care business that started about 10 years ago, and you still 
have a client from that time. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
So, 10 years with the same client, you developed a relationship with that person? 
P: 
Definitely. It’s hard not to get personally involved. I’m a people person, and you know, they’re more 
than clients. You know, to me they’re—they’re like family too, and I would just take care of them like I would my 
own family. And, of course, we’ve become close ‘cause we’ve been together 10 years [20.23]. 
I: 
So, you said that’s the one client you have left from that care business that your friend started.  
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, it sounds like you moved on to something else? 
P: 
Well, she sold it to Care and Assist who is now the agency that I work for. 
I: 
Okay. So, you are working for Care and Assist. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, you work through an agency. 
P: 
Right. So, I picked up another client from them [19.58].

I: 
And you have two clients right now? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
And how often do you go? 
P: 
The one client is 2 days a week and 1 Saturday a month, and the other client is once every other week. 
I: 
Okay. So, approximately how many hours a week? 
P: 
Five hours per day on the 2 days that I do her, so it’s 5 hours from 9 to 2. The other client is just a 
couple hours. She has a one-bedroom apartment, and I clean for her, take her to the store, whatever she 
needs. 
I: 
So, this is all after retirement. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
You didn’t really retire, did you? 
P: 
No. I did not [group laughter]. 
I: 
And you keep doing it, so you must like it? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. Well, when I worked in the hospital [19.12] years ago, you know, there were quite a few 
elderly in the hospital, and they weren’t really ready to go to a nursing home, you know, they just needed a little 
bit of care at  home. But they didn’t have, you know, caregivers in homes at that time. And so, I didn’t know 
how to start something like that, but I thought, you know, it’s too bad we don’t have something like that ‘cause 
like I said, they just need maybe a little bit of help, you know, maybe with meals or cleaning their apartment or 
something, but not in a nursing home. 
I: 
So, can you tell us more about what you do for your two clients? 
P: 
The one client is more kind of for the social that her family wanted because she has just a few teeth in 
her mouth. She can’t wear dentures. Also, hearing aids you know. If there’s more than two or three people, you 
know, the hearing aid kinda acts up, and it depends on the acoustics of the room. So, it’s mostly social, but B 
does like to go out. They have activities at this place where she lives that’s an independent living facility. I fix 
her her meals ‘cause her family—B can really do things, but her family—around the kitchen and stuff—but the 
family really doesn’t want her around the stove or anything. So, we usually fix her or I usually, you know, the 
aide fixes her meals. We make sure she takes her medication. Of course, [inaudible – 17.30] watch for any, 
you know, balance issues or falls. This particular client, if you move too fast around her, she will try and turn 
and get out of your way, so you have to move slowly. We do, you know, clean for her if she needs it too—
laundry, whatever we feel is needed. She likes to do puzzles, which is good for her mind, also the arthritis in 
her hands. I had worked in hospital pharmacy for 5 years, so I’m [inaudible] to their medications, and if I see 
them acting different, you know, I will check and see ‘cause I know what medications they’re on, but I will 
check and see if, you know, maybe they got a new medication or something because I did have one other 
client—the [inaudible] assisted living, and she had gotten a new medication, and she was kind of stumbling 
more, and she was getting more confused, and it’s like she’d go like this and like she was talking to someone 
else. So, I noticed it was klonopin, and let her power of attorney know, and she let the doctor know, and they 
did take her off of that, and then she was fine ‘cause the elderly are pretty sensitive to certain kinds of 
medications. So, you really just have to be careful, and we don’t have a lot of geriatricians, per se, you know. A 
lot of ‘em I noticed are on a lotta medications, sometimes I feel that I’m no expert, but from workin’ in the 
pharmacy I just feel, you know, they’re on too many. Sometimes they need to just adjust, and I will say 
something either to the family—would you maybe think about this, you know, and then they will go to the 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Diane Wine. 6.11.18 
 
2
doctor. And sometimes they have adjusted their medication. So, I’m with them a lot—2 days a week. You get 
to know the client [15.17] and what their mannerisms are, and how they act. So, you can tell if something’s off, 
and you gotta decide like, okay, is it maybe physical. You know, is something going on in her body that’s, you 
know—what’s throwing her balance off? You know, you just gotta kinda figure out, so you just try different 
things, and suggest different things to the family. 
I: 
And then do you also tell the agency if you’ve noticed a change in status? 
P: 
Oh, yes. We have to report to the agency on that, yes. 
I: 
And you make a good point that you’re there enough, and you get to know the client, so you can—you 
are able to tell if there are changes or not. 
P: 
Right. Yes. 
I: 
Somebody else might not because they’re not there that often. 
P: 
No. ‘Cause we sometimes will have somebody fill in, you know, say I’m on vacation or something, but. 
I: 
How about the gentleman that you take care, what do you do for him? 
P: 
I don’ have a gentleman to take care of. 
I: 
Oh, sorry. The one that you’ve had for 10 years? 
P: 
Oh, yeah. She’s a 60-year-old, and she has a weak heart even though she has a pacemaker. She has 
some kind of mental—it’s anxiety, but because of her heart medication, she can’t really take anything for it. 
She worries some, you know. It’s just sometimes you have to play kind of—I don’t know if you wanna call it 
counselor, but I can, you know, usually get her to calm down or explain, you know, C, that might not happen, 
you know, or why are you so worried about it? You know, and how do you feel? And you just kinda get ‘em to 
talk, and there are ways, you know, you can usually calm them down. At least I can her, and make her less 
anxious, and then she feels better [13.16]. 
I: 
And how did you learn how to do that or is that just you? 
P: 
It’s just me, I guess. I mean no one really ever, you know, taught me that. You just kind of by observing. 
Like in a nursing home where I worked, and in the hospital, some patients could get agitated really easy. We 
had a code purple team in the hospital, and if you approached one person the team would go in there, and 
they might get really agitated, so that means we all would back off and one person would stay and talk to them. 
It was the same thing at a nursing home. The client got out of the nursing home, the buzzer went off, and 
everybody went out there, and he just was becoming more agitated, so I said, you guys go back out there or 
back inside, and I will, you know, see what I can do. So, he was pacing, and I just walked around the parking 
lot, and said boy that was exciting wasn’t it? “Yeah.” I said, what are you doin’ out here? He said, “I just wanted 
to go outside for a while.” And, I said okay, you seemed a little upset. And he says, “Well, I didn’t like all those 
people comin’ at me.” And I said, well, they were just worried because you went out the door, you know, and 
we don’t want you getting out in traffic or anything, and I said, you know what, I’m ready for a cup of coffee. 
What about you? And he came back in. Now others—another person you might need several people, and then 
they’ll calm right down. You just kinda have to—it’s trial and error. You just kinda have to decide and try—what 
to do. 
I: 
So, there’s need for real immediate sort of decision making— 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
Problem-solving, creative thinking [11.25]. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Diane Wine. 6.11.18

P: 
Correct. 
I: 
And it’s all negotiated—every situation’s a little different. 
P: 
Exactly. Yeah. Every situation is different. 
I: 
And I imagine you get better at it over time? 
P: 
Oh, yeah. You do. 
I: 
With experience you learn what works, what doesn’t? 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
So, I’m thinking of a new personal care worker who’s just starting out, maybe younger, doesn’t have a 
lot of life experience, some people at that age have natural talent in this area, but others may not. So [inaudible 
-10.47]. So, you’ve talked about the counseling skills, being a negotiator, the companionship. What about—
over the years, you can draw on all of your experiences over the years, you have the homemaker type cases, 
and then you have cases that are more total care or higher-level care? 
P: 
I have not had cases where it’s more total care. Some of the other aides in the agency have. I have not 
had that. 
I: 
Okay. 
P: 
--with the clients I have at the moment or did have— 
I: 
You said one of your clients is 60 years old. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
She’s younger than you. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
Yes. And here you are taking care of her. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Yeah. So, do you worry about injury or—what do you do to protect yourself so that you don’t get hurt? 
P: 
Well, like I said, the clients I have don’t really have to do that. If someone would become agitated, you 
just kind of have to back off. It just depends [9.35]. You try to talk to them and calm them down. You have to be 
prepared, you know, if they’re going to hit you. You can just put your arm up or something, or just, you know, 
maybe touch them. There again, it’s just—you gotta feel out the patient to know what to do, you know, in that 
situation. Of course, I have been taught self-defense—being a woman, so there are some things, but where 
you’re not going to hurt the other person, you know. 
I: 
So, you have taken self-defense? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And you feel it’s important to this line of work? 
P: 
It can be. I feel, yes, you know, especially if you did get a combative patient. You know, I have not 
talked to any of the other aides who have. You know, they might be agitated, but usually it’s just verbally, and 
maybe that client will pace around or whatever, but some of ‘em have been struck as far as I know, but it’s just 
a matter of kind of blocking that hit, and—‘cause a lotta times they will just, you know, back down usually when 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Diane Wine. 6.11.18 
 
4
they realize what you’ve done. Some won’t. Some will keep going, and you just have to try and deescalate and 
do whatever you can to deescalate the situation. 
I: 
So, you have some strategies for protecting yourself against combative behavior. How about physical 
injury, like I know PCAs who have injured themselves just transferring somebody or— 
P: 
You can do that. We are taught proper body mechanics—ways to move, and occasionally, yeah, you 
might forget that, but yeah, we are taught proper body mechanics on how to [7.33] transfer where you’re not 
injuring the patient or yourself. 
I: 
Can you talk a little bit more about your training—what kinda training you’ve had and the value of that? 
P: 
Well, I worked on the rehabilitation in the hospital in that department, but they also taught us before I 
even became an aide in the hospital, so they just helped me [laughing]—get me up and demonstrating. They 
just show you the proper way to transfer a patient. You don’t wanna grab them up under the arms. Usually, we 
put a gait belt—what we call a gait belt around the middle, and you kind of lift them up with that gait belt. And 
you wanna put them right next to the bed or the chair where you’re gonna transfer them to and from the 
wheelchair, or the bed to the chair, and you just—they’re usually able to, you know, do little pivoting and sit in 
the chair. Now, if you have a stroke patient, one side is—say the left side, is really loose. You put what I call 
their good side right next to the bed or the chair because they can kinda pivot with their good foot, and you can 
move them over. So, yeah, you just have to be careful, especially with the elderly because you can really hurt 
them if you’re under the arms or—you may want to use a gait belt or if you don’t happen to have one, their 
pants. 
I: 
So, just for another minute or so talk us through—pretend I don’t know anything about personal care 
work. 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
And we’re having coffee—we’re chatting over coffee, and I say, well, what do you do for a living? You 
know, tell me about your work. What would you say? 
P: 
I’d say, well, it just depends, there again, on the client. Some require more care like bed baths or help 
into the shower, transferring them yourself from bed to wheelchair or to chair. Others are you just clean their 
apartments, take them maybe to the store, you can go pick up prescriptions for them. It’s mainly all about 
safety to make sure that they are safe whether they’re, you know, inside [4.56] their apartment or out and 
about. You also wanna go in there and make sure, like, there are grab bars for the shower or the tub. No throw 
rugs ‘cause they can slip and fall on that. You wanna bath mat there, but you want it anchored down, so that 
when they step out of the tub—and usually you need to be there to help them in the tub or the walk-in shower 
and out.  You just have to make sure that they’re safe. 
I: 
Can you talk for a minute about family? 
P: 
Family enters into it a lot. I mean you will—there again, besides the personality of client, you will have 
the personality of the family. And there are many different personalities. This one client that I have 2 days a 
week, her daughter is the main person—her POA. Her other two children live farther away. S has not had kids. 
She’s very particular. She—like when I first went there she was telling you how to clean the bathroom—how 
she wanted it cleaned, and the shower and the kitchen, and she had things posted on the [inaudible] side of 
the refrigerator, you know, about the safety issues. What you do when you’re getting her ready for the bath, 
and there’s a board on her refrigerator, and she will sometimes leave a note, you know, about something 
special she wants you to do for the client that day. She’s very nice, you know, we get along. Some people 
might find her, you know, pretty hard to work for, but she’s really not. I mean that’s your client. That’s their 
mother or their father. You go in there and you do what they want you to do as long as it’s not dangerous to 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Diane Wine. 6.11.18 
 
5
you or the client, so sometimes you run into people like that, but most sons and daughters of the client you’re 
taking care of are just so grateful to have you there watching their mother or taking care of her because they’re 
either working and don’t have the time, and they want to make sure that their loved one is safe. 
I: 
So, you’re assisting not only the client but the family member as well. 
P: 
Correct. 
I: 
The working example allows them to be able to continue working. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
And you’ve had some really good relationships with clients. 
P: 
Yeah. A lotta times they will even ask—the patient’s family sometimes will ask me, you know, “Well, 
what can I do to make, you know, for her, you know, what safety precautions do I need to make ‘cause, you 
know, sometimes the families will take ‘em to doctor’s appointments and things like that, too. And most of the 
family members, like I said, are willing to work with you for the betterment of their family member. 
I: 
What’s the most challenging thing about your job? 
P: 
I guess I don’t find it challenging [laughing] ‘cause I love my work, but the challenges I suppose would 
be interacting with family members. You have so many different personalities, you know, you have the family 
members, and you have the client itself. So, probably that would be the most challenging [1.06]. 
I: 
What is the most rewarding? 
P: 
Just being able to take care of them and let them stay in their home. They do so much better, you 
know, than in a nursing home. Assisted living isn’t bad either because they have their own apartment, but—
and you just—just getting to know them as a person, you know, they have a lot of history and stuff, and just 
being able to do that for them so they could stay in their home ‘cause what [inaudible], you know, I saw way 
back in the hospital. There’s gotta be something we can do so they can stay in their home. They do much 
better. They’ll eat better. They still like to have some independence. This gives them that, but with someone, 
you know, watching over them to make sure they’re safe and taken care of. 
I: 
[Inaudible – tape is bad] 
I2: 
Yeah. Let’s go inside. 
P: 
It wasn’t supposed to rain [laughing]. What is up with that. There was no forecast. 
I: 
I’m gonna stop this. Normally, I keep it going, but I think I’ll stop [end tape 1]. All right. Well, we took a 
little mini break there because of flood waters and rain and everything else, but we’re back at it for part 2 of this 
interview. And I am going to shift gears a little bit and talk about some different situations that might have 
arisen over your career and throw some different scenarios at you and see just what you think about them.  
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
So, I think one of the things we’re learning about home care is that—especially with an agency, you go 
into somebody’s home, and you have a care plan that the agency gives you, is that correct? 
P: 
Correct. 
I: 
And on that care plan it might give you a little bit of information about the client. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Diane Wine. 6.11.18 
 
6
I: 
What kind of information does it give you? 
P: 
It gives us a little bit of background [47.05] about—I was trying to think—what the patients needs are. 
That’s basically what the care plan is about. Also, if they are a do not resuscitate, that’s important to know 
because we have training—every 2 years you have to go through CPR training again and first aid so that you 
know what to do in case something happens. And we carry a card in our purse—one for first aid and one for 
CPR, so it’s mainly what we need to do for the client. 
I: 
And so, beyond on the information that’s on your care plan, you don’t know much else about the 
situation. You’re kind of walking— 
P: 
Exactly. 
I: 
--into the unknown. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. Because like I said, then you will—you always meet with the family member of the client 
because actually, they’re the one that hires you. So, they always set up a meeting with the client’s family 
member, and they will decide if they want you to take care of their client or their mother or father. And, you 
know, they will obviously check in on you sometimes. They have stopped by while I’ve been there with the 
client, and ask any questions, you know, do I need to know anything else? Did I have any questions about their 
care or what’s needed, how’s it going, you know, with my mother or my father, that type a thing [45.20]. 
I: 
Have you ever walked into a situation where you were surprised, you were taken by surprise? You 
didn’t really—you were walking into some things you didn’t expect? 
P: 
No, not really. I can’t think of any off the top of my head. The agency pretty much, you know, gives you 
the information. Like I said, and you meet with the family members, so between the two you’ve gotta a pretty 
idea of what you’re gonna be walking into. Now, maybe if the client itself is having a bad day or something, and 
it’s like, oh, okay, you know. But we know that people—we have good days and bad days, well, so do other 
people. 
I2: 
Has there been a time where you didn’t know how to handle a situation specifically with a client where 
you felt unprepared or it was the first time ever? 
P: 
No, not really. I haven’t run across that. I’m sure other aides have, but I have not. 
I: 
And it sounds like your agency does an exceptional job of preparing you in advance. 
P: 
They do. 
I: 
So, some of these scenarios may not even apply to you. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
But I’m thinking of, you know, times when you may have felt unsafe for example? 
P: 
No. I can honestly say—with the clients I’ve had I have felt safe [43.56]. 
I: 
Okay. And you talked about having a client for 10 years, now. You’ve developed long-term relationships 
with these people. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Some of them over the years certainly must have died? 
P: 
Actually, I have not had one die yet. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Diane Wine. 6.11.18 
 
7
I: 
Really? 
P: 
Yeah. Like I said, there’s one that I did have, and she went to assisted living, and I still go visit them, 
and— 
I: 
Wow. All these years, that’s unusual. 
P: 
Yeah. So,  yeah, you know, you see ‘em failing a little bit, but hearing, maybe their sight a little bit, but 
they—no. I’ve not had. I experienced that more in the hospital than when I worked in the nursing home. 
I: 
Okay. What about as people who have completely different value systems than you have? Maybe, you 
know, different opinions about politics or race or culture or anything? 
P: 
That’s one client, you know. There’s a little bit of a difference, but you just work that out, you know, you 
don’t impose your beliefs on them, and you don’t put down their beliefs or their religion or, you know, their 
political affiliation. I usually just say, you know, really, if it’s political or whatever, I might ask ‘em, you know, 
questions about, you know, the political, you know, life—where you have stuff. It’s good to keep their minds 
going, so I mean we have discussions too ‘cause it makes ‘em use their mind rather than just going there and 
like a robot, and you know, fix their meal, and get their bath ready, and [42.0]. 
I: 
Has anybody ever said anything offensive—that you took offense to? 
P: 
No. 
I: 
You’ve had some really good clients. 
P: 
I have had really good clients. Yeah, I’ve been very spoiled. I’ve had really good clients. 
I: 
And family members, too, it sounds like. 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
Right. So, are there situations that you have faced that you would like to talk about that I haven’t 
mentioned? 
P: 
[Pause] just the rapport. I mean it’s just the rapport with the patients. Like the one I have now, 2 days a 
week, “Do you have to leave?” You know, she always does that. She goes, “Can’t you stay?” And sometimes I 
will, but we have to clock out on the phone, so that they know what time we clock in, and we clock in with the 
client’s phone. Not our cell phone, so that they know. And if we’re not there like, you know, 5 or 10 minutes, 
they’re calling, you know, “Where are you?” And we clock out the same way, and they ask us a bunch a 
questions. That’s another thing I probably forgot to mention. When we clock out, like I said, there are certain 
things in that client’s care plan. So, like for example, and you punch 1 for yes, and 2 for no, like do the clients—
did you do the laundry? Did you take out the trash? Did you encourage fluids? Did you check on their 
medications? Did you change their bedding? Did they ever shower? Did you follow the client’s care plan? With 
B, there’s PT and OT. She goes up—she’s gonna be 90, but she goes upstairs. We have a fitness room there, 
and she goes upstairs 7 days a week with the pullies and the chair, and then she will stand up and do leg 
exercises holding onto her walker. And that’s another thing, you have to advise them in a way on how to walk 
with a walker. Even though they’ve been taught they forget sometimes the walker will be clear out here. You 
know, not only do you have to walk closer to it—‘cause she’ll hunch over, and then she’ll complain about her 
back hurting and that kind thing [39.26]. So, there’s guidance to it too. 
I: 
So, you mentioned a survey almost that you do. Do you do that at the end of every shift? 
P: 
It’s a question/answer to make sure that we’ve done— 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Diane Wine. 6.11.18 
 
8
I: 
Is it a hard copy or is it— 
P: 
No. 
I: 
How does it work? 
P: 
No. It’s automated in the phone system, and they ask you questions like I said, and you press 1 for yes 
if you did that task, and 2 for no. Did you like set up four-wheel walker, or did you set up for the bath? Follow 
safety—there’s different questions they ask you. 
I: 
And that’s a system that the agency has set up? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
It’s not something that the independent living place set up? 
P: 
No. 
I: 
No. 
P: 
Because at first, they were doing it by paper, and we would check off the boxes and sign our name, but 
sometimes people in any occupation you will get some that don’t follow the rules, and maybe they’ll check it off 
and have the client sign it, but then they’ll leave before their time is up. This way they can’t [38.19] by phone. 
I: 
So, there are certain things that you’re really expected to do every single time and report out on? 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
And then are there things that you’re not allowed to do? 
P: 
Well, yeah, there’s rules there too. It’s like, you don’t borrow money from a client. You don’t borrow their 
car. I mean some clients want you to drive their car, like, if you’re taking them to the store or to pick up a 
prescription. Obviously, you do not steal from a client whether it’s medications or money. You don’t ask the 
client, like, “Well, I can’t work this Thursday, so can you switch to—can I switch to Saturday or Tuesday?” No. 
It’s set up for a reason those certain days, and now, like if I want off for some reason, there’s another aide that 
works Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, so I could maybe trade a day with W. If it works out with her, or they 
have people that will fill in also. 
I: 
So, one thing I’m getting at is, you have talked about these long-term relationships, and how people 
sometimes become like family on the one hand. But on the other hand, you have these boundaries— 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
--the agency boundaries, professional boundaries. 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
Can you talk a little bit about that? Is that difficult to negotiate those boundaries sometimes? 
P: 
Not really. Not for me anyway, no. ‘Cause you know what the boundaries [36.41] are, and you don’t 
overstep ‘em. Even though, you know, how much you care, like I said, they’re like family to me or I would take 
care of them like I would want my mother or grandmother taken care of. But yeah, there are certain boundaries 
that you don’t overstep that are laid out for you. 
I: 
Have clients ever asked you to do something that you felt wasn’t within your scope of work, that maybe 
you crossed over a boundary?

P: 
Mmm, no, not really. Not with my clients so far. 
I: 
You talked about being able to switch out schedules with other people, are you able to choose your 
own schedule? 
P: 
No. It’s already set up, you know, the family member wants these days, these times, and she wants 
them covered ‘cause this client is covered 7 days a week. One aide is doing Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. I 
do Thursday, Friday, and one Saturday a month. We take turns, and they have fill-ins on the other two 
Saturdays or we can work two Saturday’s a month if we want instead of one. One Sunday, though, they do 
have somebody—a companion is called from senior services who comes in, but the rest of the time she is 
covered by a PCA [35.14]. 
I: 
So, you don’t have a lotta say in the number of hours you work or the scheduling or any of that? What 
about your rate of pay? Can you talk about that for a minute? 
P: 
I feel it’s fair. Like I said a single person trying to make a living on it, probably not. And that’s I think a lot 
of reason we have a shortage of the PCAs. You know, if you’ve got a husband that’s working or—then that’s 
probably an okay job because even for fulltime workers there’s not really any benefits. 
I: 
How much do you get paid an hour? 
P: 
I get paid $10 an hour. I started out at $9.50 because I was making $9.50 when they sold the agency to 
the one I’m working now. The top pay is $10.25 an hour. 
I: 
So, you’ve been with them 2 years? 
P: 
Let’s see, 2010—this agency—4 years. 
I: 
Four years, and you’ve gone from $9.50 to $10? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. I started at $9—no, that’s right. I started out $9.50 with the first agency, and then when she 
sold it—yeah. They will give you like a quarter raise. You get a yearly evaluation, and you get a quarter raise. 
I: 
But then you max out at $10.25. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And it’s your opinion that a single person would not be able to live on that even at fulltime? 
P: 
Depending on how many hours a week, and like, you know, if they own a house or what their rent is 
‘cause they have utilities to pay, gas in the car—they do pay mileage if like you’re going from one client to 
another client that same day [33.21]. They do pay mileage for that, and also if you take a client to the store. 
They pay you mileage for that especially if you’re using your own car, and you also have to have updated 
insurance on your car. I mean it has to, you know, meet safety standards, you know, so it can’t be a pile of 
junk, you know. And it has to be accessible for the client to get in and out of. 
I: 
And then how about liability? Does the agency handle that for you? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, you don’t worry about liability? 
P: 
No. 
I: 
At all? How about benefits? 
P: 
There aren’t any. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Diane Wine. 6.11.18 
 
10
I: 
There aren’t any. 
P: 
No. 
I: 
Do you wanna talk about that for a minute? 
P: 
Well, like I said, it’s hard for the agency. I don’t know how much they charge clients. My first agency 
they were charged for $17 for clients in Kalamazoo, and then down in the Three River’s area, where that was 
based, they charged $15. And if they’re like paying me $9.50 or $10, you know, they’re not makin’ a whole lot. I 
think we have 60 caregivers in the agency we have now, so I don’t think they can really afford to have benefits 
to give ‘em. Whether that can change, you know, because otherwise, there again, those that don’t have a 
spouse working and can’t be on their insurance, you know, they would have to pay insurance too along with 
the day-to-day living expenses [31.35]. 
I: 
And you’re able to do it because— 
P: 
Because my husband, yeah. Plus, I took social security early because that’s when my special-needs 
granddaughter was born, so I have that income also because of my age. So, if you have that, and I mean 
there’s a lot of younger workers that don’t have that.  
I: 
So, you mentioned the shortage of workers. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And we have a desperate need for PCAs, and so we need to figure out a way to bring more people in 
and convince people that this would be a good career move for them or at least the start of a, you know— 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
How would we do that? What would you tell a young person? 
P: 
It’s a rewarding, you know, occupation. You get so much out of it. It’s just not what you give to the 
client, you get it back from them, and it’s knowing that you’re able to keep them in their home where they do so 
much better. But how we could afford that on that wage, like I said, I’m sorry I don’t have any ideas on that. I 
wish I did. 
I: 
We were hoping you did? 
P: 
I know [laughing]. 
I: 
We want you to solve this problem. 
P: 
[Laughing] oh, I would love to. 
I: 
[Laughs] it’s a tough one, isn’t it? 
P: 
It is and, you know, a lotta times spouses are caregivers—end up being caregivers, and if they aren’t 
on social security [29.57] or anything, too, it makes it hard. I don’t remember if there was a bill going through 
the federal government or the local/state on paying some kind of wage to spousal caregivers. I know it’s been 
brought up, but I am not sure if that’s true now. If they have truly done that? 
I: 
Well, there are some programs where family members can get paid to take care of somebody, if you 
qualify. It’s gonna be interesting. There are some major legislative things coming down that are gonna have a 
big impact including this Medicare work requirement. So, you know, for people who are—you mentioned single 
parents. If they’re getting Medicaid, they need to be able to show that - they’re going to have to show that 
they’re working. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Diane Wine. 6.11.18 
 
11
P: 
Right. So, that might help. 
I: 
Except that they might not count caregiving, you know, family caregiving as work. 
P: 
Oh, but it is. 
I: 
So, that—you think it is? 
P: 
It is!  
I: 
Talk about that for a minute. 
P: 
Well, it—I don’t consider it work because I enjoy what I do, and most of the PCAs enjoy it too. Some of 
them are there, you know, for the money whether they need a little extra income or whatever, but it is a job. 
Just like any other occupation. It just has a lot of rewards to it. 
I: 
So, pretend you’re a high school recruiter. You’re talkin’ to high school seniors or young adults, and you 
want to recruit them into this line of work. You know, the downside is maybe the wages. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
It might not be that appealing, but the upside you’ve got to convince them that there’s an upside. 
P: 
I guess it is the reward of being able to let them stay in the home, and it is cheaper, really, than putting 
them in a nursing home [27.46] by letting them stay in their own home. For me it’s just the satisfaction that they 
can stay in their own home ‘cause they do so well in their own home than a nursing home. 
I: 
All right. We’re gonna pause again for a moment, and then I want to talk more about that. 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
I know you said there were some things you wanted to say. Are we getting to those things? 
P: 
I can’t remember what they were. That’s why you’re asking the questions. 
I: 
All right. I’ll try to jog your memory again as soon as K— 
P: 
Like I said, I just—I wish I had the answer.  
I2: 
I know the pressure of having an answer, but I think the answer’s revealed by people understanding the 
need and importance, and this kind of solution helps with the need and the importance. 
P: 
Right. 
I2: 
And I think that a lot of things that you’re very used to—you love it or just—it’s obvious to you is not 
obvious to people. So, in the last conversation we just had, we talked in detail about how [inaudible – 26.38] 
works, and that’s like second nature to you, right? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I2: 
But it is like not to most people. I’m not saying that that’s what we need from you right now, but what I’m 
talking about is that these kinds of explanations and stories is what is going to reveal the answers and reveal 
the—yeah—provide value. 
I: 
I think another way of saying it is that we’re finding that the PCAs we’re interviewing take so much for 
granted. They say, “Well, you know, I just don’t do that much for them. I do it because I love it,” but you dig a 
little deeper and you find out, oh, my, gosh, you’re doing really high-level skills here. Whether it’s using 
machinery or catheters or Hoyer lifts or— 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Diane Wine. 6.11.18 
 
12
P: 
Right. 
I: 
You know, and it’s—but you don’t even talk about that because it’s, “Well, yeah, that’s what I do.” 
P: 
It’s just second nature. That’s what I do. 
I: 
It’s just second nature. 
P: 
Yeah. So, what would I—is it you want me to say to get across to the people? 
I: 
That the work that you’re doing is valuable. It requires skills that maybe other people don’t have, would 
you agree with that? 
P: 
Oh, true. Yeah. That’s true.  
I: 
So, what skills does it require? 
P: 
Like I said, you really play many roles. You’re— 
I2: 
I’m ready. 
I: 
Oh, sorry. I thought you had started. 
P: 
You’re a PCA, you’re a counselor, you’re a mediator, ‘cause sometimes [24.50]—the one client I have, 
the daughter sometimes hollers at her, and so I just—what she’s trying to say, B, is this, this, and this. It’s hard 
to explain the skills ‘cause I guess it comes naturally to me, but [pause]—what kind of skills [laughing] are you 
looking for? 
I: 
I mean— 
P: 
‘Cause I mean it doesn’t really take a college education. I mean I had 2 weeks in the hospital, and most 
of these others have had what they call—in the hospitals and nursing homes, they’re called CNAs. Now, 
Borgess and Bronson call ‘em—in the bigger hospitals call ‘em PCAs. So, they have like I think a 3-week 
training course or more. 
I: 
Well, let me throw a couple things at ya. How ‘bout a Hoyer lift? Have you ever used one? 
P: 
Oh, yeah. Mostly in the hospital, but I could use it in a home too. I mean that’s—that’s no biggie. You’re 
trained in the hospital or are able to use it. 
I: 
So, could anybody use that? Could I do that without hurting myself or somebody else? 
P: 
You would have to be shown how to use it, and yeah, so you don’t hurt yourself or anybody else. 
I2: 
Earlier, you were talking about how when you do your check-in you explain how if you’d encouraged 
fluids or not, do you remember that conversation? 
P: 
Yes. 
I2: 
How can you get someone that’s a human being to have more fluids? 
P: 
Well, I just give ‘em a reason why, you know, what can happen to you if you get dehydrated. In fact, I 
have a hard time with this one client. She’ll take a sip here and a sip there. No, B, you need to drink more 
because otherwise—‘cause like she’s always complaining she’s tired. That’s part of dehydration. You’re kind of 
a—what do you call it? Not an informant, but you’re like a teacher, I guess, too, is what I’m trying to say. 
Because I tell them, you know, what’ll happen. You can get confused. You get dehydrated. Your sodium levels 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Diane Wine. 6.11.18 
 
13
in your body, you know, your electrolytes and stuff—and I explain what electrolytes are to ‘em—will go off. 
You’d be more tired, you stumble, you’re sleepy. It’s something your body needs. 
I: 
So, much of your knowledge—you’re so knowledgeable about so many things, and you just take it for 
granted. I mean for example you were talking earlier about working for a pharmacy for 5 years— 
P: 
In the hospital, yeah. 
I: 
You kinda know about the drug interactions, and you can tell if somebody’s taking too many drugs, or if 
there’s a change in status. You can—that’s a skill. That’s a skill. 
P: 
It is a skill, but I mean like the normal person coming in might not have that skill. Most of ‘em have had 
the CNA training, you know, and what they train us to do, but all the other things, you know, there’s hygiene, 
too. You know, washing your hands. Obviously, like this one client’s family—she doesn’t like you—if you’re 
sick, you stay home. I don’t care if you got just a sniffle [laughing], you know, you stay home. So, there is that, 
but yeah, you gotta wash your hands. Safety precautions, like if you’re mixin’ somethin’ up, you know, you just 
don’t look [laughing] the same [inaudible] or whatever. But yeah, you have to be careful about that too. Always 
washing your hands when you’re there. It’s just proper hygiene. If you have to, you know, take care of bodily 
fluids like emptying out catheter, like you say, bag, and stuff like that [20.59]. 
I: 
So, there’s a great example. Catheter care. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Could anybody just go in and change somebody’s catheter? 
P: 
The nurse inserts the catheter, and then the nurse is the one that would take it out. We just empty the 
bag, and you rinse out the bad, and you usually empty it in the stool and stuff. And if, you know, usually—
‘cause there’s always a nurse involved too, that visits the client every so often from our agency, and so like, 
you know, the patient might be on intake and output, so you know if they’re getting enough fluids. 
I: 
So, you’re recording. 
P: 
Recording. Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Input and output— 
P: 
Output. Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Which is a skill. 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
You talked about deescalating several situations that were getting kind of tense. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. You just kinda learn to sidetrack the patient and the patient’s family. 
I2: 
Let’s say that you were going to come up with a persona of a person who would be good at your job, 
can you tell me about what that person looks like? What that person talks like? What that person acts like? 
P: 
[Laughing]— 
I2: 
Like we’re gonna make a robot that is an ideal PCA. 
P: 
Okay.  
I2: 
What’s their temperament’s like? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Diane Wine. 6.11.18 
 
14
P: 
Oh, yeah. You have to have, obviously, you know, some self-control. You’ve gotta be a diplomat. You 
have to have—oh, be like an extrovert. I mean you have to enjoy people and taking care of them. You can’t 
just—I’m not good with adjectives and stuff, I’m sorry. 
I2: 
No, no, no, no. You’re doing great. 
P: 
They would have to know about safety issues, hygiene, you know, for the client ‘cause, you know, 
some people you might go into their place and they haven’t taken a bath. They haven’t changed their clothes, 
and yeah, so I mean you’re kind of a teacher too. You just have to know—there’s so many things you just need 
to know [18.36] for this kinda job. 
I: 
How about working with patients or clients with dementia? 
P: 
I have had [pause]—that can be hard, but you have to—you can validate because, there again, they 
might argue with you, you know, because they think this is so and so. And you don’t wanna get ‘em agitated, 
but you need to kind of give them a reality check. Like, “Well, I already took my meds.” They’re in your little box 
here. Most of ‘em have these little boxes by the days, and I’m going, see this is Tuesday, and you haven’t 
taken it yet. “Oh, okay.” You know, they mostly get forgetful, so you just kinda—a lot of repetition maybe, you 
know, to remind them. And like I said, you gotta be careful, and they’re insistent that they did that. 
I: 
What do you say to people who say something like, “All you do is babysit,” or “fix meals. How hard can 
it be to fix a meal?”  
P: 
It’s not hard to fix a meal, but you also have to know what the patient’s like, you know, what kind of food 
they like. With my client, because she doesn’t have much teeth, there’s a food chopper there, and you have to 
make sure that the food is chopped up good enough for them. Also, she sometimes—I don’t think she has a 
stricture, but she can, you know, kinda like choke or can get caught a little bit. That’s the other thing we have to 
know—the Heimlich maneuver. So, yeah, I mean there’s—like I said, you can’t fix anything. 
I: 
Have you worked with clients who have different dietary needs? 
P: 
You can have someone that’s—I haven’t, per se, but my husband’s diabetic, so I know. Yeah, you’ll 
have some that are diabetic, so you’ve gotta watch their, you know, sugar intake. Family usually has, you 
know, if they’re buying the groceries for ‘em, you pretty much have the stuff on hand that they can be eating. 
Now, B, for example—this one client that I have, salt. She’s supposed to be on low-sodium, but her family’s 
real good about, you know, watching that and what they buy for it—it’s low-sodium stuff if they buy her food. 
I: 
But you would need to know how to prepare a low-sodium diet or meal? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Or a diabetic meal? 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
Have you had clients who have refused to eat or just don’t wanna eat? 
P: 
They will say, “I’m not hungry,” and I’m gonna go, okay. How ‘bout if we wait half an hour or so, maybe 
you’ll be hungry then. And that usually works. 
I: 
So, what are the differences about home care and the nursing home where you worked or the hospital? 
You’re in there by yourself, right? 
P: 
Right. Yeah. You don’t have anyone, you know, to go to per se. You know, like a nurse or somebody 
like that in a nursing home. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Diane Wine. 6.11.18 
 
15
I: 
So, what happens if there’s an emergency or something comes up where you need help? 
P: 
Well, you pretty much handle the situation. It depends on what kind of emergency it is. You’re gonna 
have to handle the situation, you know, yourself. Like say the patient falls, you check them over and ask if 
they’re hurt, and then you usually could call the family member, or they have pull cords there, and she has a 
thing around her neck that she can press, too, and that will bring an EMT there, if I feel the need to be checked 
over. Usually—well, you can pretty much—I can—tell if they’re really hurt of something. Otherwise you call the 
family member and say, you know, our mother just fell. I’ve assed her. I don’t, you know, will tell ‘em what the 
client says. “No, I don’t hurt anywhere. My head doesn’t hurt,” depending on what part of their body, you know, 
hit. But I really would feel better if you would take her to the doctor’s office or to maybe an urgent care or ER. 
And then you also let the office know too, what happened. You fill out an incidence report, but you call the 
office, too, and let ‘em know what’s goin’ on. Family member’s gonna be takin’ them to ER or to an urgent care, 
and then you, like I said, you’ve got an incident report—sheet of paper that you fill out. 
I: 
It sounds like you [13.16]—you’re agency’s a little different than some of the others we’ve heard of 
where the PCA would just automatically call the agency, and then the agency would call the family. It’s sounds 
like you would call the family first, and then notify the agency that this is what you’ve done. You’ve done the 
assessment, you’ve notified the family, is that right? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And then the agency would support the way— 
P: 
Well, it depends. Again, let me back up. Depends on the client. Now, S, the daughter of this patient, 
would want to be called first. You call her and let her know, and then I call the agency and let them know. But’s 
a quick decision, you know. It depends on what’s goin’ on with the patient. 
I: 
I’m just thinking, some agencies might—I don’t know, liability—wouldn’t want you making that 
assessment. They would want to make that assessment, you know, and they would want to call for— 
P: 
They know—it’s in the care plan for this particular client. 
I: 
Right, but for other clients? 
P: 
Right. But for other clients then, yeah, I would call the agency. 
I: 
So, it would be important for the agency to support whatever decision you made? 
P: 
Yeah, and they’re very good about backing that up. 
I: 
Have you ever encountered a situation where you made a decision and got pushback from family or 
your agency? 
P: 
No. 
I: 
Because your decisions, I’m guessing, are pretty [laughs] accurate. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
You know, you know how to handle situations. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
I’m wondering about other PCAs who might not be as experienced and might not know how to handle 
certain situations? It would be important I think for the agency— 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Diane Wine. 6.11.18 
 
16
P: 
Yeah. The agency—at least the one I work for is very good, and I had worked for another agency, too, 
and they were very good about that [11.14] also. I mean they don’t just send you right out, they have to know 
that you, you know, are gonna be able to respond to any type of emergency. You have to, you know, think for 
yourself sometimes, but they make sure you are very well trained before they even send you out or even hook 
you up with someone, you know, family member. 
I: 
So, what would happen to these clients, these people, if you didn’t exist? If there was no PCS? 
P: 
They’d probably end up in nursing homes or assisted living, and they just go downhill in nursing homes. 
They have no quality of life. ‘Cause in assisted living they have their own apartment, too, so that’s not too bad. 
You might meet my S. 
I: 
I’m assuming that’s your husband? It’s not a person you’ve never seen before? 
P: 
[Laughing]. 
I: 
[Laughing] okay. I know when we first started the conversation you were very clear that when you were 
in the hospital homecare wasn’t a big deal. It wasn’t that existent at the time. 
P: 
No. It didn’t exist at all. This was like way back in 1968 through ’76. 
I: 
And you kept thinking I should be an option because these people weren’t ready to go to a nursing 
home. 
P: 
No. They weren’t. They were still capable of doing a lot of your what we call daily living activities. They 
just needed a little help here and there. You know, like I said, maybe for a meal or getting in the shower [9.15], 
but a lot of ‘em were capable of, you know, making their own meals and stuff. They just needed a little bit of 
help, cleaning up their place or whatever. 
I: 
One of the things that I find striking is that it’s not just about the physical care—the bathing and 
everything—in order to stay in your own home— 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
--you need help with—you need to be able to do, not just the bathing, and dressing, and the [inaudible] 
care, but you also need to be able to cook or clean— 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
If you can’t do those things those become the tipping point. 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
So, even those things are so of critical in terms of getting assistance and being able to stay in your own 
home, is that correct to a degree? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. And you know, family doesn’t have time to take ‘em grocery shopping or whatever, you 
know. Most of ‘em are mobile. When they do go out, they might have to take those wheeled walkers, but other 
than that, you know, and I like would push the grocery cart for ‘em, but it helps them maintain their 
independence as long as possible. You don’t wanna take that away. I let me clients—in fact, I encourage them 
to do as much as they possibly can [7.48], and that’s what they wanna do ‘cause a lotta times, you know, they 
aren’t able to drive, you know, and that’s kinda the last in dependent thing that’s taken away from ‘em, and a 
lot of ‘em have a hard time with that. So, it’s nice that you can keep them in the home ‘cause they can still do 
things around the home. Maybe the guy likes to work with wood or likes to do, you know, yardwork ‘cause most 
of these places have little patios or something like that. They like to still feel useful, and that they can still do

things, you know, ‘cause you don’t have to hover over ‘em like a, you know, baby or whatever. You encourage 
it. 
I: 
So, you’ve expressed some frustration about certain things like the pay, which is fine for you, but you 
don’t think it’s a livable wage for a single person, for example. If we’re going to encourage people to come into 
this field and address this shortage, can you pretend for a minute that I’m a policymaker, I’m the Governor, I’m 
the President, and you—what would you recommend? Tell me what to do. 
P: 
[Sigh]. 
I: 
What do you want to tell me first of all about—you’re going to have to convince me that this work is 
important. 
P: 
Well, it is important. Like I’ve been saying [6.21] people do better in their own homes, and if you can—
it’s just a worthwhile profession. Just putting them in a nursing home is not the answer, and we’re gonna have, 
like you say, a lot more baby boomers coming up. There is such a need for this, but it doesn’t pay the greatest. 
Like I said, if you happen to have a spouse that works, it’s okay. But it’s just something that’s really, really 
needed. We need to take care of our elderly more. I think some countries take better care of their elders than 
we do. You know, they’re more respected, or I don’t know what the word you wanna use, but these are people 
that still vote, you know. 
I: 
Good point. 
P: 
So, and not all of them have dementia. They have good ideas too, you know. They can still contribute 
to some extent to the world in their own way. I really don’t know what the answer is, but we do need help in 
providing for these people ‘cause there’s so many of ‘em, and plus it’s the financial factor, too, that nursing 
homes are more expensive than just keeping people in their homes or apartments or there’s a senior 
community or whatever. They’re still contributing members to the society. They’re voting and opinions. 
I: 
I just have a couple more questions. Is there anything else that you really—this is your big opportunity 
here to tell the world what you do and how important it is, what changes you think. Is there anything that you 
really want to say? 
P: 
Not that I can think of that I already reiterated on. 
I: 
Okay. So, one of the reasons we’re doing this project is to put a human face to the work that you’re 
doing—the PCA work that you’re doing. And so, we’re interested in humanizing it. You know, letting people 
know that you’re a real human being. The people you’re taking care of are real human beings, and you’re a 
real human being. So, I’d like to take the last couple minutes to round out the picture of you, and we know that 
one aspect of you is that you’re a PCA worker. Can you tell us a little bit more about yourself? What other 
aspects of yourself? How would you describe yourself and your life and what you like? 
P: 
I just enjoy life. I enjoy people. I enjoy helping them. I think people have this—some people have an 
idea of what older people are like, you know, that they get dementia, they just need to go to nursing homes, or 
they’re not useful, or like you say, they’re human beings just like us. And they function, and they thrive, and 
maybe there’s—because of either a hearing aid or some type of disability—if they’ve had a stroke, it doesn’t 
mean that they’re less of a human being. They just need help with certain aspects of their daily living, and 
that’s why I enjoy doing what I do. 
I: 
It’s your contribution. 
P: 
It’s my contribution, yes. 
I: 
And we learned earlier that you have three boys?

P: 
Yes. 
I: 
And grandchildren. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
And you take them to Dairy Queen, and— 
P: 
Yeah. They like Dairy Queen. I take ‘em to Dairy Queen. I kick the soccer ball with them. Jump on the 
trampoline with ‘em. We do things together as, you know, family. 
I: 
There’s a note on your frig from your granddaughter that says, “Grandma makes me laugh.” 
P: 
Yes. I think I’m her comedy relief. She thinks I’m funny [laugh]s. but she likes it ‘cause she says, 
“Grandma, you don’t look old.” You know, ‘cause her birthday’s near mine, and I’ll say I’ll trade ya. I’ll be 9 and 
you can be 71. “You’re not 71.” Yeah. I am 71. “But I thought people that were 71 were old [laughs].” You 
know, and I said, well, it used to be. I said I think 80s and 90s are now the old age, but I just—I enjoy my 
grandkids. I enjoy gettin’ together with my, you know, boys and their families. We picnic together, and get 
together, of course, at Christmas and just very family oriented. 
I: 
It’s a great story. K, is there anything you’d like to? 
I2: 
No. Thank you very much. 
I: 
Yes. Unless you have more you’d like to say or, you know, what’s your favorite color? 
P: 
The pastel colors—pink, peach. 
I: 
What kind of ice cream do you like? 
P: 
Mackinaw Island Fudge [group laughter]. 
I: 
See there’s so much more I’d like to find out about you. 
P: 
[Laughs] 
I: 
[Laughs] but we’re about out of time, so I want to thank you again for this interview, and really for the 
work that you do. It’s so important the work that you do. 
P: 
Thank you. 
I: 
I’m glad to have this opportunity to have you share it with the world. 
P: 
Thank you. 
I: 
I’m going to clear out and let K do his things with the photo shoot. 
P: 
Oh, God. I’m not photogenic. 
I: 
I don’t believe it. 
P: 
I am not. I’m usually the one taking the pictures. 
I2: 
[Laughs]. 
I: 
That’s my line. I’m the one behind the camera.
