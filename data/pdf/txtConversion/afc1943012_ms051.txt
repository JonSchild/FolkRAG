September 4, 1943, letter from B.A. Botkin to Willis
Laurence James
September 4, 1943 Mr. Willis Laurence James 39 Chestnut Street, S.W., Atlanta,
Georgia
Dear Dr. James:
Your letter, records and copy of The Peachite came while I was on vacation. I have had no
opportunity to hear all of the records but I am very much pleased with those I have heard.
We are making a set of duplicates for Fort Valley State College to which I hope you will
have access for transcription purposes. Unfortunately, we have no provision for any but
recording projects.
I am very much interested in your water front songs. Would it be possible for me to see
some of them?
We had an enthusiastic letter from Bliss Wiant, who was a Judge at the Festival. He writes
as follows:
“I am anxious to receive a set of this material inasmuch as I have never before witnessed
such an outpouring of spontaneous and powerful melody. We need not fear for the vitality
of the negro but because of it if this is a criterion of his native urge and expression.” ( sic. )
Recently Stirling Brown read me a chapter from his forthcoming book dealing with you and
the Festival at Fort Valley. It is extremely well done and you should feel happy to have
inspired it.
I am writing Dr. Bond concerning the blank disks and needles which were sent to him for
the use of Lewis Jones in March.
