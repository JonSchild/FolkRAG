Introduction.  Gerrit Dykhouse and Suzanne Wiersma, Wallaceburg Bookbinding and 
Manufacturing Company Ltd., Wallaceburg, Ontario, Canada. Interviewed June 3, 2017, 
at the Roslyn Hotel, Roslyn, New York. Interviewed by Jeanne Drewes, librarian.

Career: Gerrit's father, Harry Dykhouse and his partner, Christopher Verstraete, started 
the company in the mid-1950s, both gentlemen were from the Netherlands.  Gerrit's 
father was not a bookbinder, but Christopher Verstraete was a hand bookbinder.  Gerrit 
became involved with the business because of his father's involvement.  He worked at the 
bindery over two summers, doing delivery work and meeting with customers.  He found 
the work and the people interesting, and none of his siblings were interested in the 
business at the time. 
 
Suzanne started working in the bindery with a part-time job in high school, taking over 
from her older sister, doing data entry to create a database.  She continued to work there 
part-time while she attended community college, studying computer programming and 
systems testing.  A full-time job in the computer room doing data entry, running the RB-7 
stamping machine and computer project work became available after she graduated.  
Suzanne thought that would be a good first job. 
  
  
00:04:13 
Mentors: Gerrit taught himself how to use much of the machinery.  There were always 
key go to people in the industry that you could consult with. Werner Rebsamen at RIT, 
Jack Bendror of Mekatronics, Bruce Jacobsen and Jim Larsen of Bridgeport National 
Bindery and Paul Parisi from Acme were willing, good resources.  The Library Binding 
Institute (LBI) membership in general was a great resource too.  There was a steep 
learning curve when the bindery moved from hand bookbinding to binding for public 
libraries.  The LBI membership provided great opportunities as well, like visiting 
Bridgeport National Bindery or other binderies for a tour to share and learn from each 
other’s production methods.  
 
Suzanne learned about binding from Gerrit and his brother Clarence, but the automation 
and implementation of new technologies in printing, stamping, embossing and library 
binding preparation was self-taught along with other binderies using the same software.   
They collaborated together with Dan Swiecanski from Bridgeport National Bindery, John 
Salistean from Houchen Bindery and Hank Racette who wrote the program LARS 
(Library Automated Retrieval System) binding software.  Industry suppliers Fritz James 
(LBS), Lang Whiteman, Jack Bendror (Mekatronics), Jerry Flesher (Flesher Foil 
Lettering), Ted Greene (GP2 Technologies), have provided mentorship to Suzanne as 
well.

Changes in Business over Time: When Gerrit started in the business, it was a constant 
struggle to keep up with the demand for binding services; now the library binding 
demand has shrunk and textbooks have become a larger component of their work.  The 
technology has changed drastically, from hand stampers and Ludlow machines for 
casting type to automated flat stamping, case making machines, automated rounder and 
backer, to the Ultrabind machine and now the Mekabind fan binders.  The bindery once 
had 8-10 people stamping covers; now only two people work on the automated stamping 
equipment. 
 
Suzanne has worked at the bindery for 34 years, and has seen the change from a digital 
mainframe computer to using personal computers.  The first PC they purchased was a 
Compac which cost $10,000; now they cost $500.  The mainframe computer used large 
format cartridges which changed to 5.5" floppy disk storage for the personal computers to 
3.5" floppy disks to memory sticks, and the use of file transfer protocol to move data.   
  
  
00:14:49  
Roles: Suzanne started in the computer department, implementing the automation of 
bindery operations.  The second half of her career has focused on administrative roles:  
contracts, pricing, inventory, and accounting. 
  
  
00:15:35 
Goals: Originally, optimizing binding for the library binding customer, now the focus is 
on optimizing processes for their textbook customers.  There is some efficiency gained in 
the textbook market because there are identical sets of materials, but they also rebind 
textbooks.  There has also been an increase in Print on Demand work and custom binding 
work for the consumer market.  Focus and marketing efforts are shifting to this area. 
  
  
00:17:52 
Changes in Business over Time: Consumer orders have increased.   Customers that 
didn't exist in the past are finding the company through the Internet.  Locally or from 
afar, consumers are sending books for repair, rebinding or restoration.  Students login in 
to the bindery website to have theses printed and bound.  They simply send a pdf file.  In 
a matter of days, the printed and bound thesis shows up at their door.  Print and bind 
services are available for as few as one book and up into the hundreds. 
  
  
00:20:52 
Regrets: Gerrit has occasionally questioned whether using LARS binding software 
instead of ABLE (Advanced Bindery Library Exchange) binding software had isolated 
the company from certain markets, but it also protected their business with customers 
who liked LARS and didn't want to change over to ABLE.  This may have kept their 
company smaller, but they are the right size for them and create a high-quality product. 
 
 
00:25:57 
Greatest Accomplishment: Gerrit is proud of his management of the production part of 
the business and his relationship with the loyal staff.  He still hears from past employees, 
on social media or in person, about how much they loved their time working at 
Wallaceburg, especially the students who worked there as a summer job. 
 
Suzanne is proud of her work and involvement in the development and testing of the 
LARS software, including writing the manual for libraries using LARS.   
 
 
00:29:55 
Associations: Suzanne attended the LBI meeting in Key Largo, FL, in 2001 in Gerrit's 
place.  This led to her growing involvement in the association by chairing the 
Membership Task Force, the By-laws Committee, serving on the Board, helping with 
conference logistics and creating the 75th Anniversary Book and slide show.  It has been 
so much more than a professional organization; the members are like family. 
 
Gerrit was an LBI board member, and served as president during a time of membership 
loss and consolidation of binderies.  Endorsing the concept of expanding the organization 
to include “Hard Cover” binders outside of typical library binders was outside of the box 
and difficult to implement when not unanimously supported. 
 
 
00:34:50 
Interesting Projects: Wallaceburg's binding process is unique, as Werner Rebsamen 
observed when visiting the bindery.  They trim as little as necessary instead of trimming 
the bookblock to a predetermined size.  They don't measure bookblocks at the beginning 
of the binding process; they're measured after rounding.  The measurements are tied to an 
order number and item number instead of being written on the endsheet so the bookblock 
is handled less while it's drying.   
 
 
00:44:32 
Building and Plant: 10,000 square foot building.  Currently 30+ employees during the 
summer, and roughly 12 during the rest of the year.  The year-round employees are cross-
trained and have been there for more than 10 years. 
 
 
00:46:13 
Employees: At one time, they had 40+ employees; now there are about a dozen.  During 
the summers when they're filling textbook requests, they hire 20-30 students.  Students 
often come back summer after summer, as many as nine years in a row.  Some students 
are the children of people who also worked for the bindery when they were students. 
 
 
00:49:15 
Advice to Next Generation: Gerrit has a son and a daughter, as does his brother 
Clarence, and they are not interested in continuing the business.  He hopes Suzanne will 
take over at some point.  Specialization may be the secret to surviving in the industry.  
The Internet has connected them to customers they would not have found through 
traditional marketing.  It's important to produce work that has value and meets the needs 
of your customers. 
 
Suzanne recommends reading books—real books!  Don't be afraid of change.  Think 
outside the box.  Be solution-focused.
