We're celebrated authors, 
Who're well ' nown every where, 
We have such heavy intelects 
We both have loss our hair. 
We wrote the poem of Beantif I

We wrote the bands on Grandfather's Clock, 
We wrote a

And we call it Rye and Rock.

Our heads are swelled up with our brain,

We write new & writs by the yard, 
And comedies by the peck 
We

And " Billee

We w rote Ned I

Chorus, 
She Never Chins as we Pass by. 
By Dan. F. Morton. 
Sung with ;-_ ureess by the great 
Chinese Serb o 
Comics Ward tiz Lynch. 
My fun is spoiled now for my life, 
I'm married to a 
red-head wife; 
She weighs tour hundred and twenty pounds, 
'Tis fun for to hick me round. 
She has a 
double action jaw, 
And the longest tongue you ever saw, 
She'll stab me with a 
custard pie. 
But she never chins as we lass by. 
Cnonns. 
We never speak as we pass by, 
But she'l build a 
French fiat o•I my eye, 
I've got to skip off for my life, 
When she'll chase me with a 
hu:cher's knife. 
Now jn the corner she will sit, 
And never snout or talk a 
bit, 
But if I 
should stay out late, 
She'll hit me with an old stove grate. 
I 
told her I 
was going South, 
But not a 
word escaped her mouth, 
Now don't I 
lead a 
happy life, 
When I 
neve hear my darling wife 
CHORUS. 
She never speaks when I'm in bed, 
She'll sling a 
table at my head. 
She never talks, for drinking rum, 
Has made her deaf and blind and dumb.

The feathery snow was falling fast, 
They sat them by the winder, 
Why do those flakes resemble me? 
Said. Josh to Jane Belinda. 
Belinda answered looking up, 
To where the drifts w, re blowing, 
Because it, takes a 
hap of them 
To make a 
Iiitle showing. 
A hit, a 
hit, most palpable, 
Returned the waggish suitor; 
But Josh then showed by words and deeds, 
An answer rather cu er. 
We're like those flakes said he to her, 
He said quite so cosely, 
Because like the snow fla es you and I, 
Do clir.g together closely.

are all Foolish. 
STUMP SPEECH. 
By D. F. Mort( ii. 
D!dieated to Ward & LynCL., 
 oo  
Ladies and gentlemen, imagine that I 
am a 
lawyer, you 
can believe this without much effort of your imagination, 
for I've practiced considerable at the bar. 
My eases have 
been clues of old rye, with an occasional basket of cham-
pagne thrown in. 
I'd have to be extra dry, and keep very 
Munim before I'd get much of the latter 
The prisoner at the bar is accused of being a 
fool, 
I, a 
bigger fool appear for him, and I'm going to prove that the 
judge, jury, and everybody els from the poor tramp who 
steals a 
t. ' n 
of coal, to the politician, who steals a 
seat in the 
United States Senate, are members of the damphoolibus 
Innaticus, or to talk in 
lain English, is ilamphools. 
Now in the first place, here I 
am rfln ing and spouting 
like a 
hundred and seventeen mule power lunatic, you sit 
there and listen to me, I 
get paid for being foolish, you 
7 
WE ARE ALL *FOOLISH. 
COICTD.ZIJED. 
have to pay to listen to me, so I 
leave it to your own trans-
cendent alhypothitical peregrenations, ain't you bigger fools 
than we. 
Now look at that celebrated hard case, Roscoe Conk-
ling, he resigned from the United States Senate because he 
was an honest m n. 
Now do you th nk the sta route 
frauds who stole millions, think Roscoe Conkliug a 
sensible 
man, 
Yet Roscoe could make a 
speech four wiles long in 
thirty minutes. 
While the men who picked Uncle Sam's 
pocket only know addition, division, and silence. 
That is, 
steal, whac up, and say nothing. 
We see a 
married man with a 
red-headed wife, bald at 
twenty four. 
Now that man may say he is six foot high, 
and he sleeps in a four and a 
half foot bed, and that the 
fr ction of the bead-board wore off his hyporion spit curls, 
but we all know that his wife pulls out his hair by the roots, 
in order that she may use it to make a 
new set of montague 
frizzes. 
Now that man is a 
fool, and his red-headed wife is 
a 
fool, for she could take the money that her husband spends 
fDr a new blonde wig, and buy a 
five dollar scat for the 
matinee. 
There is the case of Misses Langtry, she was the friend 
of the Prince of Wales, ' till the Prince of Wales' wife whaled 
him for being too fresh, Mrs. Langtry gets one thousand 
dollars a 
nigh for acting in Shalespere's plays. 
Now ain't 
CONTINUED. 
ola 13i11 ShalreSpere a 
fool for to call on her to slaughter him 
and ain't we Baxter Sheet aristocrats bigger fools to, pay to 
see her, when many a 
Yankee girl, who's rosy lips are red-
olent with the flavor of baked Boston beaus is better look-
ing, and as bad an actress as the New J, rsey lily ever dare 
to be. 
When we allow such fellows as Oscar Wilde, why it 
makes me wade when I 
think of it, Oscar wears O'Brien's 
high water pants at half mast, and talks a 
lot of gush that a 
Hoboken donkey would kick his own brains out if he heard 
it, still Oscar has made a 
horse ear full of money, and in-
stead of traveling with the monkeys in some menagerie, 
and who gave foolish Oscar this, why, w - Yankee fools. 
We see an alderman foolishly spend five thousand 
dollars for an office worth one thousand dollars a 
year. Yes, 
and we, our great and free American's very foolishly vote for 
him. 
The alderman saves fifty tho sand dollars out of one 
thousand salary, inside of three years. 
The voter gets a 
trade dollar for his vote, and yet as I 
stated before, and if I 
am not behind, I'll state it again, the free and foolish 
American citizen thinks he ain't a 
fool. 
Ladies and gentle-
men, I 
will say in couclusion, we are all fools. 
If we don't 
believe it, we are bigger fools. 
And ZONV after I 
have proved 
you all to be fools, I 
w 
11 conclude by saying that I am the 
most unmitigated, contaminated, unphilosophistieated darn 
fool of the whole gang. 
Dance Without Exertion. 
Kind friends lend your ears awhile, 
While we relate to you a 
little story, 
We 
just came from the Emerald Isle, 
And you can ace were ft( I 
ng in our glory. 
We landed here but yesterday. 
We're full of elocution, 
And if you'll .listen for a 
We'll s ow some style and execution. 
Cnonus. 
For we re two Irishmen from that 
rest isle, 
That lays away across the briny ocean, 
So keep your seat for a 
short while, 
And we' I 
do a 
little dance without exertion. 
We catne over on the White Star Line, 
On the big ship called the Adriatic; 
We were four days behind the time, 
But yon must not think it made us acrobatic. 
But now we leave you for awhile, 
Until our feet get rested, 
We'll come again So1110 other night, 
With something new and interesting. 
Chorus.

OFF THE WHEEL. 
Written, Composed and Sung by HARRY W HALING, Author and 
Comedian, at TONY PasTotes THEATRE, Broadway, N. Y., 
with great success. 
Behold a 
man reduced in life, 
Though strange to me it seems; 
For in this world of rich and poor, 
I've seen the two extremes; 
once was gay and happy, 
Through life jogged merrily along; 
My woes I'm sure you'll pity, 
When you've heard my little song. 
CHORUS: 
As the lark sings high up in the sky, 
As the sun shines forth its rays; 
I 
think of home and friends so dear, 
I 
had in better days; 
But now I'm sad and lonely, 
The pangs of hunger feel, 
Dame fortune's turned the scale on me, 
I'm now, friends, " Off the Wheel." 
When blessed with peace and plenty, 
And a 
loving wife to cheer; 
I 
from my home with friends did roam, 
And nothing did I 
fear; 
I 
spent my money foolishly, 
My race I 
ran too fast; 
But poverty overtook me, 
And I'm " Oft the Wheel" at last. 
(Chorus.).

1, 
OFF THE WHEEL—CONTINUED. 
My wife quite broken hearted, 
Was driven from her home; 
Cold, hungry and dejected, 
We side by side did roam; 
But death, alas! soon laid her low, 
Which drove me to despair; 
I've nothing now to live for, 
How I 
long her lot to share. 
(Chorus). 
And now, kind friends, I'll leave you, 
To some distant spot I'll creep; 
And there concealed by darkness, 
On the cold, damp ground I'll sleep; 
For better days to-morrow, 
I 
fervently do pray; 
Or from this world of sorrow, 
Death will summon me away. 
(Chorus).

In aid of the wife and family 
Of Timothy J. Cosgrove. 
Kellys. Hogans, and O'Briena, 
All came in a

To take the dice and shake them nips, 
And try and win the stove.

Forward fcur, allaman left, while the music it did play. 
'Twas grand delight to see the sight of those Irishmen so 
gay, 
I 
never laughed so hearty in the course of all my life 
Looking at Plug McCarty, pivotin' with his wife. 
At nine o'clock precisely 
The raffling it bFgun, 
Tom Kelly he jumped ten foot high 
When sixty-four was flung; 
O'Brien yelled out murder, 
With a 
brick his eye was closed ; 
On that night I 
had to fight, 
While ladling for the stove. 
(Chorus.) 
At six o'clock in the morning 
The raffling it was o'er, 
Torn Kelly he got staving drunk 
And stole away the door; 
Clancy with a 
bott.e, 
Sure he all the windows broke; 
C•Dsgrove grabbed him by the neck, 
And boys, I 
thought he'd choke.

The shamrock Home. 
Nylicated to Josx &MOB, the Axing Irish Comique, by Bzbi amiss, 
Bung by Jxo. REILLY. 
In Erin's Isle—the shamrock's home, 
A 
darling fond and true, 
A 
lilly fair, with golden hair, 
And cheeks of the brightest hue. 
I 
soothed her sorrow, bade farewell, 
Murinurred, "Katie, think of me,' 
Grasped her father's hand and left 
To cross the stormy sea. 
Katie, darling, think of me as always by your side, 
And never fear, my colleen dear, 
I'll return for you, my bride. 
Chorus. 
Katie, mine, when the winter wind is snarling, 
The love ot my colleen will cheer me always, 
Think of our parting sorrow and starting, 
I'll remember you, too, in the long summer days. 
I 
often think of the happy days, 
When Kate and I 
did roam, 
By the old mill that's running still, 
Where the waters dance and foam, 
It was there I 
met her in the evening, 
Throwing pebbles at the tide, - 
Homeward bound, what happy momenbk 
She was by my side , 
I 
am thinking of her al'. day, 
Long My Cushla Gra Machree, 
And dreaming of her lovely face, 
It fills my heart with glee.

CHORUS. 
Jingle, bells, jingle, bells, jingle all the way, 
WI at joy it is to ride in a

The other day I 
thought 
That I 
would take a 
ride, 
found myself goon seated, 
With Fanny by my side. 
The sleigh bells they did jingle, 
The horse (lid snort and blow, 
And otr we started sleighing, 
Upon the crested snow, 
Jingle, bells, Jce. 
We started soon for home, 
A-singing that same old song. 
Oh don't you see them little bays 
A-
trotting right along? 
They gayly prance and skip, 
And know it's all right, 
For they have got all through their work, 
And bound for home to- night.

She'd like to eke a

And if agreeable to her 
We'd do Delmenico's. 
She said she'd go along with me, 
And tossed her pretty head, 
And then, as if by impulse. 
She turned to me and said :—Ah 
! 
you little darlin, I 
love you.

A 
privilege it is to be born in this land 
Of the noble, the proud and the free, 
Where each man will offer his heart and his hand, 
To drive out such cruel tyranny. 
Such as was practiced by English rule, 
In the days of oppression gone by ; 
But like solid men to the front they did come, 
Determined to conquer or die. 
Then good people here just take my advice, 
No matter whatever you lag ; 
If you should have the honor to adopt this land. 
Pray never go back on the flag. 
If you take this advice you will surely End

blessing you'll find in the end ; 
And you will be loved by the good and the kind, 
If to your duty you do well attend. 
But be not like the men who would gain themselves 
wealth. 
And to crime they will let themselves drag; 
But be honest and upright, and above all you do, 
Pray never go back on the flag. 
Then good people, etc. 
It was under that flag that Benjamin Franlitin was born, 
A 
statesman both noble and true. 
Though poor at the first, yet himself he did raise, 
To be proud of the red, white and blue. 
It was under that flag that George Washington was hors, 
The father of this country, 
And with many others he nobly fought, 
To make it the land of the free. 
Then good people, falla.

There was a happy time to me not many years ago, 
When th.t darkies used to gather round the door, 
l'hey used lo sing and dance at night, and play the old banjo. 
But alas, they cannot do it any more; 
The hinges are all rusty now, the door is tumbling down,

Bonnets and ribbons she does sell; 
On the Bowery she owns a store, 
She has " "

And Augustine Delia Clancey that's the bell-

Shure it's every Sunday night, 
It is my heart's delight 
To go up Miss Clancey for to see. 
A 
grand piano she plays so fine, 
To me she is divine, 
And all those lovely songs she sings to MC. 
CHORUS. 
She sings, she sings Sweet Bye and Bye, 
And go to sleep my Baby Mine. 
She sings, she sings such pretty tunes, 
The girl I love I'll marry soon. 
There is Owen Smith and Grady, 
The Misses Scott and Doyle, 
Sitting in the parlor all so fine. 
Sure Smithy has comical talk, 
And such a 
funny walk, 
Which causes all the party for to smile. 
When Miss Clancey does appear 
Such curious things you'll hear, 
" 
Miss Clancey, dear, you're looking all serene," 
She srniicl and bows her head, 
To the piano she lightly ',reads, 
And all those loyely songs she sings to me.

With coffee and doughnuts done brown.

Say how do you do Boquet Doyle.

Da-ies and Posies and Pink and White roses 
With Perfume I'm ready to choke, 
Oh! carry me out or I'll die. 
I'm out every night till just about dawn 
And up with the Lark in the morn; 
Sure just before dark I 
walk through the park, 
And feed all the sparrows with corn. 
The Mayor of the city knows me, 
And with him I 
often do dine; 
And whenever I 
meet a 
poor man on the street, 
I 
always do give him a

THERE'S ALWAYS A 
SEAT IN THE PAR-
LOR FOR YOU. 
Written by W ILLIAM SCANLAN, and performed by the great 
A 
SCANLAN Sr, CRONIN. 
Music published by F. W. HELMICK, 
No. 50 Fourth Street, Cineinnatti, Ohio. 
The subject to-night of my song is love, 
Something quite heavy to bear; 
When that being you love to you prove: i—ltrue, 
For none else in the world do you care. 
The lady I 
love is an angel divine, 
And with her my life I 
would share: 
But whene'er I 
go to her house her to see, 
The:e is always somebody there. 
SrorcEN.—I explained the matter to her the other evening, 
and when I 
had finished, she looked into my face this way, and 
said, that's nothing— 
Cuonus. 
There's always a 
seat in the parlor for you, 
No matter hew many are there; 
There's always a 
seat in the parlor for you, 
A 
sofa, a 
stool, or a 
chair. 
I 
went to her house one evening last week, 
You may easily judge my surprise; 
I 
was just going to enter the hallway when 
I 
met that which opened my eyes. 
For there stood a 
man both tall and stout, 
Who said wkat do you wish here ? 
Grabbed me by the neck, threw me out on the walk, 
And the last words I 
could hear while there was--
IESIIIETIC MICK. 
As sung by John O'Neal w!th great success. 
If you have got a 
five dollar note to cash, and want 
to catch a 
lovely mash, 
I'll tell you what t do; 
You must buy a 
bran new silk high hat, a 
pair of 
patent leather boots, 
And a 
necktie that's too-too, 
You must wear a 
flowing ulster, and say that you're 
from Munster, 
And walk off eating quick, 
In your pocket carry a 
billy, in your buttonhole a 
lily, 
And they'll call_ you the resth4ic Mick. 
CHORUS. 
And the neighbors all will say, as you are walking 
down the alleyway, 
" 
If that style suits all the families in the rear, I 
am 
sure that style suits me, 
Then what a 
very, very, very stylish young man 
[his stylish young Mick must be." 
Be eloquent in praise for the very good old days, 
In the time of Bryan Born, 
And convince them if you can that your sister Mary Ann, 
Wore a 
small size number nine shoe. 
You must tell them she is crazy on the shamrock 
and the daisy, 
No matter what they think, 
You must have a 
terrible gall when you're asked to 
take a 
ball, 
And never miss a 
drink, 
CONTINUED. 
CHORUS. 
And they all will say, as you're walking down the 
alleyway, 
There goes that dizzy young tad I 
see in the Park 
most every day, 
Then what a 
very, very, very dizzy young tad. 
Thi4 dizzy young tad must be. 
Now a 
sentimental passion for a 
regalable fashion, 
Now it don't auit you or me, 
If you have only got the cash for a 
five cent plate of 
hash, 
You must strike some brewery. 
If the boys they give you taffy you can walk with 
John McCaffery, 
He's gentle and he's kind, 
Forget to be aesthetic when you're working up a 
racket, 
And go to the front every time. 
And the neighbors all will say as you walk down 
the alleyway, 
There goes that chronic young lush that works the 
free lunch every day, 
Then what a 
very, very, very chronic young man, 
This chronic young man must be.

TilE GM OF TIM SEA. 
Written by PAT REILLY. 
-:0: 
With all condescension I'd turn your attention, 
To what I 
would mention of Erin so green; 
And without hesitation, I'd show how that nation 
Became of creation the gem and the queen. 
It happened one morning without any warning, 
That Venus was born in the beautiful sea, - 
And be that same token, aad sure 'was prevoking, 
Her pinions were soaking and would not give play, 
Till Neptune who knew her began to pursue her 
In order to woo her, the wicked old Jew; 
And he very nigh caught her on the top of the water, 
Great Jupiter's daughter who cried philaloo. 
So jove, the great genius looked down and saw Venus, 
And Neptune so heinous pursuing her wild; 
So he roared out in thunder I'd tear him asunder, 
And sure 'twas no wonder for teasing his child. 
So a 
star that was flying around him aspiring, 
He seized without sighing and hurled it below, 
Where it tumbled like winking on Neptune while 
sinking, 
And gave him I'm thinking a 
broth of a 
blow, 
That star was drylana both lowland and highland, 
And formed a 
sweet island the land of my birth ; 
Thus plain is the story, case sent down from glory, 
That Erin so hoary is a 
heaven on earth. 
So Venus jumped neatly on Erin so stately, 
But fainted case lately so bothered and pressed; 
Which much did bewilder but ere it had killed her, 
Her father distilled her a 
drop of the best. 
That glass so victorious it made her feel glorious, 
A 
little uproarious I 
fear it might proove; 
Hence how can ye's blame us that Erin's so famous, 
For beauty and murder and whiskey and love. 
THE WILD IRISH BOY. 
.` 
sunr by Mum M ORRIS, at Fox's American Thes.tre, Philad'a, Pa. 
FAREWELL to the dear land I 
have left far behind, 
Farewell to my father, although he was blind, 
Shall I 
ever forget him while my heart beats with joy, 
For he called me his own son, the wild Irish boy, 
Ves, he called me his own son, the wild Irish boy. 
When I 
came to this country I 
had brogans on my feet, 
And corduroy breeches, although they were neat, 
Sure the boys all laughed at me, but it gave me great joy, 
For they called me their hero, the wild Irish boy, 
Yes, they called me their hero, the wild Irish boy. 
I 
will send for my parents, and they wilt come here, 
To a 
land 1.11ed with plenty and a 
land I 
love dear, 
I 
know they will bless me and it will give me great joy, 
For they will call me their darling, their wild Irish boy. 
Yes, the; will call me their darling, their wild Irish boy. 
There's the land of my kindred, I 
neer can forget, 
They may be a 
time coming when it may be happy yet, 
I 
wish to God it were now, for ' twould give me great joy, 
For to gaze once more on it, though a 
wild Irish boy. 
Yes, to gaze once more on it, though a 
wild Irish boy.

My Love He Is a

Written originally for, and sung by Emma Whitney, of the 
"Novelty Four," in their original Burletta Rehearsal in 
the Parlor. 
Oh, my love lie is a 
sailor bold ! 
And he shipped on a 
man-of-war 
He sailed away one year to-day, 
And I 
ne'er snail see him more. 
He is reefing on the main-top sails, 
Or hauling on the maiii-top gaff, 
Or winding in the slack when the ship takes a 
tack, 
And the wind three sheets and a 
half. 
CHORUS. 
He sailed away with his heart so true. 
He sailed away with his shirt of blue. 
He sailed away with his gallant crew, 
And he said, " I'll write, I'll write to you." 
He sailed to a 
foreign port, 
Where the monkeys and the cocoanuts grow. 
He wrote to me most every week; 
For he loved me true, I 
know. 
He started on a 
homeward trip, 
And they shipped in awful sea ; 
But my sailor brave came home on a 
wave 
With his heart still true to me. - 
CHORUS. 
We were married in the month of June, 
Though he had a 
wooden leg. 
An orga•I he did buy to stop the passers-by, 
An the government allowed hint to beg.

On Scotland's fair hills, or the mountains and rills, 
I've wandered there many a 
happy day; 
in looking at the lads and the lasses on the green, 
'Neath the fine old hills of Scotland far away. 
I've looked for her coming, but she's not come as yet, 
The truth seems to dawn on me plain; 
They say she is false but I'l; a

She's my darling blue-eyed Scotch lassie Jean. 
0 Jean, my dearest Jean ! 
Come to your lacidie once again ; 
They say you are false, but I'll still believe you mine, 
You're my darling blue-eyed Scotch lassie Jean. 
She said she soon would ineet me, but I've waited long in 
vain, 
In lands far away she doth roam; 
Her promise she will keep, 0 ! break it not. my Jean, 
We'll be happy in our bonnie little home. 
Then let me not long wait, let me meet you soon. my Jean, 
And Heav'n will then smile rn our love ; 
And when life is ended, we'll leave this earthly scene, 
When our hearts will dwell in jov and bliss above.

I 
know a 
big fat widow, 
That keeps a

A 
making beds for horses that are sick, 
She's an awful early riser, 
And a 
champion appetizer, 
Like an eight-day clock 
She goes around on tick. 
She's from the country poor-house, 
Her husband was a 
tramp, 
In the English army he did beat a 
drum, 
And for singing tar-heeled Hanna's, 
Or murdering sick pianos, 
There's no marker for the big fat Widow Duan. 
CHORUS. 
She is hunky, she is chunky, 
She's as handsome as a 
monkey, 
She's a 
fairy, she's contrary, 
She's a

She's as tall as any ladder, 
I'd slug her if I 
had her, 
And kick the chest protector off the Widow Dunn.

THE CONVICT'S FATE. 
Written by JOHN SHEEHAN, and sung by SHEEN & JoNza. 
In Sing Sing Prison where convicts dwell, 
Many funny stories they can tell; 
In Auburn, too, they cannot lurk, 
They are provided with plenty of hard work; 
If they make a 
mishap, the punishment is hard, 
Three days breaking stones out in the yard; 
And if one trys to mash the keepers' daughter, 
His bill of fare is bread and water. 
What are you in for? Nothing; that's what they all 
say, 
Well, I 
stole a 
suit of clothes and sold it down 
the bay; 
Say Jack it's hard, to-day I 
only eat a 
cracker, 
I'll give you a 
kiss for a 
chew of tobacco; 
The Keeper will drop, I 
heard him yell, 
Nix, or he'll sentence us to the dark cell;. 
It's too bad about Jimmy, in life he might have 
risen. 
Only think of dying in a 
lonely State's Prison. 
Who is that fellow Keeper Twelve sent to bed? 
If I 
catch him in the Shoeshop I'll break his head; 
You better let him alone, Mike, the punishment is 
deep, 
Four days without food, and four days without 
sleep; 
Look what he done when Kelly gave him the slip, 
Every day gave him a 
stroke with the whip; 
Well I 
don't give a 
cent. I'll make somebody cry, 
I'll give any Keeper sauces rue t 
smash in the eye, 
THE IRISH POTATO.

APPLES AND PEARS. 
Sung with great success, by W EED & BRADLEY, of Theatre 
Comique, 514 Broadway, N. Y. 
I'm a 
widow with a 
large family, 
My husband was killed in the war; 
He enlisted one day for a 
soldger, 
Faith, they murdered my darling agra : 
From the Goverment I 
receive a 
small pension. 
Which all my family does share ; 
Faith, it ain't enough to maintain us, 
For I 
have to sell apples and pears! 
If I 
was a 
man I 
could labor, 
Sure, what can a 
poor woman do; 
I 
can't stand all day at the wash tub, 
The reason I'll tell now to you; 
I'm troubled bad with the Rhenmaticks. 
And to put up with, many's the cares, 
And that's the reason you see me 
Out here, selling apples and pears. 
There's a 
great many men I 
could marry— 
There's Dennis McCarthy, so fat! 
There's Patsy Marley, a 
sound boy! 
Faith, be is a 
good Democrat! 
But they all do object to the children; 
To marry me, not one of them cares; 
So I'll let them all go to the divil, 
And stick to my apples and pears! 
Parody on the "Old Oaken, Bucket." 
HOW sweet to the taste is the I 
Hall Potato, 
As memory awakens the I 
houalit of the plant! 
Its dark, verdant vine-top, and beautiful blossom, 
In pleasant transition my memory haunt ; 
I 
thought of the root in profusion once growing 
On tia; broad sunny hill- slope a,ljoiaing the mill, 
At the homestead how many we raised there's no knowing 
Fur some were but small ones, and few in a 
hill. 
OHO R 
1.78. 
The mealy potato, the Irish potato, 
The thin-skinned potato that grew on the hill. 
That delectable plant I'll prize while I'm able, 
For often at noon when returned front the Nit, 
I 
found it superior to all on the table— 
The best flavored edible that nature could yield, 
With what eager appetite, sharpened by labor, 
I 
plied knife and fork with a 
hearty good will ! 
Alas! there are none of the old-fashionce. flavor, 
None like the real " simous" that grew on the hill. 
The mealy, &sc. 
How prime from the full heapen dish to receive it, 
As, poised on my fork, it ascends to my mouth 
No appeal to the palate could tempt me to leave it, 
Though atlected by rot on a 
long summer's drouth; 
And now far removed from that situation, 
V'here I 
used to partake of the root to my ill 
fancy fain would revert to my father's plantation, 
And sigh for the, " kidney- t.hat- grew on the hilL

Round de meadows am a 
ringing 
The darkres' mournful song. 
While the mocking-bird is singing, 
Happy as the day is long. 
Where the ivy is a 
creeping 
O'er the grassy mound, 
There old massa is a 
sleeping, 
Sleeping in the cold, cold ground. 
CitoRCS. 
Down in the corn-field 
Hear that mournful sound; 
All the darkies are a 
weeping— 
Massa's in the cold, cold ground, 
When the autumn leaves were falling, 
When the says were cold, 
'Twas hard to hear old massa calling, 
Cause he was so weak and old. 
Now the orange tree is blooming 
On the sandy shore, - 
Now the summer days are coming, 
Massa never calls no more. 
D 'min in the corn-field, tira 
Massa made the darkies love him, 
He always was so kind, 
Now they sadly weep above him, 
Mourning. Ex he leave them behind.

And the fate of hungry little Ben.

And then got drunk again.

That he woukl drink no more; 
But then he would forget 
From " benzine " to abstain,

"

And upset brother Ned, 
And drive us all into the street,

Until he woke and left the house, 
To come home drunk again. 
We've given him up for go, s.

TEETOOTAL IN THE MORNING. 
Written, composed and sting by Limon- W HALING, at TONY PASTOR'S

I'm one of those aw ful jolly dogs 
Who love to lounge all day, 
And Come what will, or ‘vhat folks preach. 
I'm sure to have my way. 
Sonic say that I've more brass than brains. 
Some truth in that may be ; 
I'm known throughout the country as 
The swell who loves a

Then come if you're coining, boys, out with me. 
Come if you're coming for a 
jolly good spree : 
Then come if you're coming, to- night we'll merry he, 
We'll all be teetotal in the morning. 
Teetotal is my motto when 
My temperance friends I 
meet, 
To hear them praise me for being good 
It is a 
jolly treat ; 
But should they see me when I'm tight, 
And wish to give me warning. 
I 
say " Friend Joe, I'll promise you 
To he teetotal in the morning." ( Chorus). 
With lots of coin, why sit at home 
And mope both night and day; 
The song says, life is but a span— 
Be happy while ye may. 
A brimming glass, a 
pretty lass, 
Is what I 
love to see ; 
A. jolly lark, boys, after dark 
Is just the thing for me. 
Who's goinp• to have a

For I 
intend some fun, 
I'll stand for all both rich and poor, 
No man I'll ever shun. 
You can always share whate'er I've got;

Is round and must go round.

Written by W TLI,Lild SCANLAN. 
Oh, Willie, dear Willie, our mother is dead, 
Our mother whom we loved so dear; 
She's sleeping to-night in her cold, cold grave, 
No more will she be with us here. 
How happy we were when by the fireside. 
With mother we'd sit all alone; 
And what stories she'd tell to both you and I, 
Tint now she has left our dear home.

Yes, mother has gone to Heaven above, 
And there's one thing of you I 
would crave; 
An children should do for a 
mother so true— 
Put a 
headstone o'er her beloved grave. 
How often, when sickness kept us in our beds, 
Not a 
friend in the world could we find 
Half so good as our mother, who'd sit by our side, 
And to us be so gentle and kind. 
Yes. morning and night. she'd watch our sick brow's, 
.Never thinking of rest; 
But now she has left us alone here to weep, 
And gone to the land of the blest. 
Yes, mother has gate, etc,

Many Can Help One. 
Sung with great success by HARRY RICHstoNn. 
Some very good sayings I've heard in my time, 
And some I 
believe to be true; 
The one I 
will mention to-night in my song 
Is one that is well known to you ; 
if you meet a 
man who is down in the world, 
And assistance you can' give him any 
Remember that , nany can always help one. 
Where one cannot always help many. 
CI-tut:us. 
Then give what you can to those in distress. 
Let it be a 
dime or a 
penny, 
For many can help one, I've heard people say. 
Where one cannot always help many. 
How often a 
trifle would save a 
man's life 
When he is near dying from want ; 
He's tried to live honest all through his lifetime, 
But finds in the end that he can't ; 
At last he is tempted to steal or to starve, 
His rich friends they all pass him by. 
They heed not his wishes, they care not his wants, 
He's left like a 
dog there to the. ( Cho.) 
A man may be wealthy one end of the year 
The next one be wretched and poor ; 
He's struggled his hardest to keep himself up 
But has sunk down to poverty's door ; 
Such men as these deserve your support. 
So give it to them who most need, 
For those who've experienced poverty know 
'Tis a 
very hard battle indeed. (Cho J 
I 
hope what I've mentioned to-night in my 5ong,. 
That nothing l've said out of place 
A man may be poor but still honest be 
For poverty, ' tis no disgrace , 
Then give what you can with a 
generous heart 
No knowing when the tide it may turn • 
Just give him a 
chance to rise up in the world, 
And your kindness he's sure to return.

GIVE THE WORKINGMAN A 
CHANCE, 
As originally sung by W ILL H. 
MORTON, at Howard Atheneum, 
Roston, Mass. 
Some boast of wealth and riches, but give me the hardy hand, 
Give me the honest workingman, the pride of every land; 
The man that earns his living by the sweat of labor's brow, 
That Wields the axe, the pick, the spade, or stands behind the 
plough. 
I 
love the sons of manly toil, they built up our success, 
And made a 
mighty nation of this western wilderness; 
Unto our bright protecting stars they nobly did advance, 
For well they knew our flag would give each workingman 
chance. 
They spanned the mighty prairie, they enriched the American 
soil, 
They built each railroad in the land, these sons of hardy toil; 
In vain did other climes compete, our vessels swept the sea, 
For labor wils our bond of strength, bright labor, strong and 
free. 
I 
envy not the titled lord, nor yet the man of wealth, 
I'd rather have the sinews strong, that tinge of ruddy health, 
That labor gives to all her sons whose watchword is advance, 
What made our great success—we gave our workingman a 
chance. 
Let England send her hardy sons, to them we'll give the hand, 
We can't forget that Washington sprang from the motherland, 
Let Germany her thousands send, to leave their sunny Rhine, 
And Russia, from her icy plains, in countless thousands join. 
Let Ireland send each manly form, no tyrant here does stand, 
A 
welcome sweet we'll give to all in our bright Western land, 
Come from the home of Lafayette— the sunlit hills of France, 
Tor 'Us our greauist joy to give each 7orkingman aCh9.1169A

Amen can Fortune-Telling Card  —This is the old-
.. 
est and most widley known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We have 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arranged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each of these into K for King, Q for Queen, 
and K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. 
The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under 
standing. 
Many professional Furtune-Tellers use these cards, and ws 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

Courting Cards. — This Series of Cards has been arranged 
tJ meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a 
way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffl , 
dent-qa;Ino fearful of a 
repulse to venture upon asking the m oment
ous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result or tills dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections which fact makes a 
further explan ati on an 
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

-' A 
Little Book has lately appear.d in print at Mr. A. J. 
FISHER'S, No. 24 
Vesey Street, called the 
Little Flirt." We cannot say that we recom 
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it woald 
only encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunatly, there is 
enough of it done without any further necessity of explaining "how, 
when and where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initi-
ate the uncorrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a 
neat little 
book, bound in Morrocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt." published by A. J. FISHER, No. 24 Vesey Street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
.8 nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might 
afford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recoil'. 
mend it to our yoang lady and gentlemen readers."
