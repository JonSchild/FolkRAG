First stop is the festa at Mary Star of the Sea 
Church, your basic carney-run carnival: bumper cars, ferris wheel, tilt-a-
whirl, etc., but also festival queen candidates selling raffle tix, local 
Italian-American orgs. selling food or "chances" at teddy bears and such. The 
lady selling folk-arty posters of the town -- in which the church itself and 
the blessing of the fleet figure prominently -- launches into the sad tale of 
the decline of the fishing fleet. The brick inside and out church has a nice 
stained-glass window depicting a fishing boat, roiling sea, and big, shining 
fish being handled by a big, shiny fisherman. Or at least that's how I 
remember it. It will,:of course, be photographed. And the craftsperson who 
executed it will be found out. We came back in the evening -- direct from our 
meal in a Venetian-Italian shopping center restaurant (this is California, 
folks) where hung a painting of the arcades of St. Mark's Square (excuse me, 
Piazza San Marco) with a moonscape instead of pigeons and cafes filling the 
square -- just in time for the crowning of the queen. It was teen heaven, the 
air was heavy with the smell of french fries and, having just eaten sculpin 
livorgnese -- I was impressed with the way the signora (David knows her name), 
presented the entire fish on a platter and took the meat off the bones and 
kept the head, saving me the trouble of dealing with it -- the whirling carney 
rides did not appeal, so we cut out.

What leaps out at you at A-1 imported groceries are 
all the brands of olive oil they carry ; an entire aisle devoted to pasta, a 
piece of oaktag on which are pasted cut-out pictures from a photo joke book on 
how to be an Italian. Behind the counter , Emiddio Ungaro, named for his 
grandfather , 30-something , said he was born in (near? ) Naples, came to the 
states a babe in arms, married an Italian girl because you gotta stick with 
your own kind and friends of his who did not stick with their own kind wound 
up divorced , speaks Italian at home, but refuses to do so in the store, and 
sported a World Champion L.A. Dodgers cap while sipping from an L.A. Lakers 
mug. Naples is nice, he says of his trips there, if you don't mind getting 
hugged and kissed by old ladies all the time . He sounded like he minded.

Shambling along the near-deserted fishing slip late 
this afternoon, I came upon Mike Taormina behind the wheel of his Chevy pickup 
with another gent in the passenger seat and Joe Randazzo leaning in. Taormina, 
I knew, is a taciturn sort. I was looking for his brother Leonard. Catch him 
in the morning, he said. Morning is when the fishing slip jumps. Retired 
fisherman Gerrard Fiorentino still keeps fishermen's hours at his marine 
supply shop: 5 a.m. to 3 p.m. Same is true.nextdoor at Canetti's Seafood 
Grotto ("Same owner since 1949," says the rubber sign in the window.) There's 
no missing Canetti's. It has a sign painted on the building -- and bracketed 
by a brace of smiling fishes -- above the door and a high, free-standing neon 
sign that says Canetti's Seafood Dinners (with the word "Seafood" outlined by 
a fish) and in larger letters, "Breakfast." 
Randazzo, 73, was voluble, but perhaps not available. If he gets a clean 
bill of health from his doc tomorrow (He's got "bum legs. Standin up is what 
gets you.") he's off to Vegas "to roll dice. I was lucky enough to make enough 
money to retire," he says. Since retiring 10 or so years ago, he's gone out 
with his sons , Paul and Louis on the Santa Teresa or the Julie K, who would 
rather he didn't. When I ask him what time the boys go out, he says they don't 
like to say when pop's around because they're afraid he'll join them. "They 
tell me, 
'Stay home.' I say, 
'Why? Do you think I'm gonna fall overboard.'" He 
tells them to let him take the wheel so they can get some rest. His grandson, 
also named Joe, also pesters his sons to go out fishing. The elder Joe tells 
him, "You're getting this too much in your blood," and urges him to follow his 
other grandfather into "big business" and to go fishing only to get "fresh 
air. 
Once, he asked Joey if he was seasick. When the boy said he wasn't, 
Granddad said, "Good boy. You're a fisherman. But don't be a fisherman." 
of "modern fishermen," he says, "They make me sick. It's not like the 
old days." For example: the Sicilians (Joe, born in St. Louis, but a Pedro 
resident since he was seven or eight years old, is from a Sicilian family), 
Neapolitans and Slays "used to intermingle and get along pretty good. 
Everybody used to like everybody. Now, everybody's jealous." 
Things are more hierarchical now, as well, with Central Americans doing 
all the crewing -- "No more Europeans. The Europeans must've all got rich." 
Then there's technological change. His sons, he says, are good 
fishermen, but they use fish spotters and think "that's 90 percent of the 
battle." Joe disagrees. "When you're good, you're good." 
"It's all one big story," he concludes, and roars off in his silver, 
mag-wheeled, convertible Mustang GT. Mike Taormina, alone now, continues to 
sit in the Chevy.

8 a.m. on the slip . The Nancy L. has just come in, but 
the pit bull on the bridge is off-putting . 
Across the way, where a crew is 
power-blocking purse seine off the Maria T, looks more promising. The Maria T 
has come in the day before from fishing for mackerel , mainly, but also tuna, 
bonita and squid off Santa Catalina Island . There are seven guys: Captain Vito 
Terzoli, sons Nino and Robert (secreted in the engine room), a young Ischian, 
and three Salvadorans I think they were. Cap'n Vito , 55, and a fisherman since 
age 7, came over from Palermo in 1964. Nino was 4. Vito 's father, also a 
fisherman , was already here. Vito crewed tuna boats for several years before 
he was able to buy (with two partners ) his own boat. Three of his brothers are 
boat-owning fishermen. The fourth is a merchant seaman. Maria T, a 64-footer, 
was his first wife, dead 10 years. She (the boat, that is, not the wife) 
recently took six months off for cabin remodeling. Over the galley table hang 
a print of the Last Supper, and a Madonna and Child . On the table are strewn 
crossword books, decks of cards, dominos . Vito says he attends mass at Mary 
Star of the Sea sometimes, not always. He fishes on St. Joseph 's day (March 
19), a day when he should be staying home and lighting fires, and never 
catches anything. 
` 
First interview , equipment set up on the net, roar of cars, truck, 
planes, copters, radio, cry of gulls, while the sewing goes on, is with the 
son, Nino, a brawny, sandy-haired, blue -eyed fellow who looks nothing like 
anyone's idea of a Sicilian , as he is the first to admit . He speaks English, 
Italian and enough Spanish to talk to the three Hispanic crewmen. Like our 
friend Emiddio at the A-1 Grocery , he married an Italian girl. Unlike him, he 
felt no imperative to do so and thinks it might have been better not to. 
Italian wives spoil their husbands , he says. Asked what he eats, he said, "My 
wife, she's American ." They eat pork chops, steak -- American food. In Sicily, 
Vito will say later, they only ate meat on Christmas. Until he remarried, he 
says, "If I don't eat pasta once a day, it wasn't a day." Now he's down to 
twice a week . 
When I ask Nino if there's anything about his house, inside or 
out, that is identifiably Italian, he asks me if I mean things like backyard 
vegetable gardens. "Every Italian that's got a little patch of dirt grows 
tomatoes , squash. But I don't have a backyard . I have a front yard. I grow 
carnations ." His dad has always grown his own tomatoes and zukes. As for his 
own "Italian -ness," he says , "I don't think you walk into my house and say 
this is typical Dago ... My front porch isn't painted red." And also: "It's hard 
to hold on to your roots when you're so far away." 
As for the fishing : there's nothing fun about net fishing, Nino says. 
What's fun is finding the time to throw a hook-and-line over the side, catch, 
say, a rock cod to bring home and '
eat. The mackerel that get caught in the net 
go to the cannery the fishermen themselves bought a couple of years ago, the 
old Starkist plant on Terminal Island, renamed Un ited Food Packers. While we 
talk, another young fisherman , another Ischian , just back from Alaska, stops 
by. Where's my salmon, Nino asks him. It's got an oil slick on it, the Ischian 
says . "Exxon written all over it ." A flurry of Ischia-Sicily rank-outs 
follows. Sicilians , according to the Ischians , are Africans. "We used it (the 
insults ) to burn each other ." Dodger coach Joe Amalfitano , apparently, is 
Ischian . And a good thing, too , say the two Ischians . If he were Sicilian, the 
Dodger would never win a game . The Ischians also claim Babe Ruth and Joe 
DiMaggio as their own . Nino counters by claiming Hank Aaron as a Sicilian. 
Second interview is with Vito , white-haired now, once blond. He too, is 
lacing net as we talk . Life in the U.S. he says is "a hundred times better" 
than in Sicily. Life is better on the big tuna boats, but you've got to stay 
out for months at a time. He discouraged his sons "a hundred percent" from 
following him into fishing. What's hard about it, he says , is not the work so 
much , but the uncertainty of it. Better to "work on the beach and be home with 
your kids , your wife every night ." The best fisherman isn't the one who makes 
the most money , he says , because the amount you make is too dependent on luck. 
These are affable guys , but not voluble.

Full moon and no sign of tuna: these are slow days on 
the fishing slip. The fishermen go out nights when the phosphorence of schools 
is clealrly visible, either from the crow 's nest or the spotter planes, but 
they 're harder to see in the moonlight. And the fishermen like to fish cheap 
mackerel in winter and expensive tuna in summer. Actually, they'd be happy 
fishing tuna all year, but summer is when the tuna appear , only this summer 
they haven 't -- yet . The fishermen -- the few hanging around the slip the last 
couple of days -- seem a little edgy. 
While David waited for his friend Gaspar and I went looking for the 
elusive Mr . Taormina we stumbled on each other then on our friend Dominic, 
whom we mutually corraled for an interview alongside the boat he crews for, 
the Sea Queen. Before we begin he talks about the moon ("Right now the moon is 
too big" ) and about the make-up of the San Pedro fleet . For the most part, he 
says, the Slays have the big purse-seiners, the Italians the smaller boats. 
The Italians could afford to buy big boats too , he assures us, but they don't 
want to stay away from home too move . The wives of the big tuna boat fishermen 
tell their husbands: "I didn't marry the boat; I married you." I think they're 
wrong. A fisherman 's wife marries the fisherman and his boat. 
Dominic is another Palermo man. He celebrated his 50th birthday last 
week. When David asks him about the differences between fishing in Sicily and 
San Pedro , Dominic says, "Those days , everything by hand," and launches into a 
litany of all the tasks that had to be done by hand: a nice series of 
repetitions . "Then they got smart," he said, meaning, then they started using 
motors and winches. 
The interview includes detailed descriptions of the division of labor 
among the crew, of how sets are done , of how shares work, of the relationship 
between the fishermen, the cannery and the fresh fish markets. The industry is 
dying, he says: "Less fish, less canneries, less boats, everything less." His 
own son is a realtor . "He doesn't want to even smell the fish. 
What listening to the tape of this interview will not convey, is what a 
performance it was. I asked Dominic at the end if he thought he could talk if 
he were tied up. He didn 't think so . Neither do I. He slapped and chopped one 
hand or jabbed one finger against the other palm, used his thumb to point 
behind him or to himself, his index finger to point ahead, described the shape 
of a set and the boat's position relative to it , imitated the motion of the 
sea and of things crashing down on one and performed an endless number of 
variations on the shrug . It's a wonder he didn't knock one of us, who flanked 
him, into the drink.

Mike Taormina is at his usual post behind the wheel of 
his pickup at the far end of the slip, whence he has a commanding view of all 
the moored boats and the rare ones that come in. Tony Barcott is his 
"passenger " this day, he of the late , lamented fishing school next door to the 
Little Fisherman restaurant in the Fishermen's Co-op building. If this project 
were about the Slays , Barcott -- the "Professor" -- would be the place to 
start . As it is, he plays the referrer 's role. While we chat, John DiMeglio --
checking the spelling of his name I see there are no less than 26 DiMeglios in 
the phone book -- drives up . He's 82 
(b. 1907 ) and assures me he's not smart 
enough or eductaed enough to give me the information I seek, despite my -- and 
Mike's and Tony's -- protestations to the contrary . He then gives me an earful 
while the two of lean on Mike's truck and gaze, Mike-like up the slip. 
DiMeglio is a native San Pedran. His dad, granddad and great granddad 
were Ischian fishermen , dad coming to the states around 1904-or-5. He worked 
on the railroad in New York for $1 .50 a day before joining his brother on the 
West Coast . In those days , DiMeglio says, there weren't just Italian and 
Yugoslav fishermen , but Dutch , Swedish, Greek, Portuguese and Japanese as 
well. In those days, you could walk across the slip (300 feet wide) on the 
decks of the boats, all small, the big purse seiners didn 't come until the 
twenties . He joined the fun at age 12, going to school days and fishing 
nights, and fished, always locally, never on the big tuna boats ("like luxury 
ships" today) until the late sixties-early seventies. "Now I miss it," he 
says, "because there's big money in it." When I remind him that the prevalent 
view is that the industry is dying, he gives a derisive wave of his hand. 
"Three-four-five months you don't make a nickel," he concedes, "but all at 
once you hit it." And he sounds the familir oldtimer theme : that the young 
guys, with all their fancy gear, have it easy . "Today they don't work at all -
- radar, fathometers, sonar." Whereas in his day, "it was a struggle. You had 
to work like a slave . Everything was by hand and if you made 10-15 dollars a 
week you were lucky." Nevertheless , DiMeglio calls it a "clean life ," meaning 
"a healthy life. Nevertheless , he discouraged his sons from following the 
fisher's life and they have not, though their "on the beach" jobs are very 
much on the beach. One runs the Little Fisherman restaurant over our left 
shoulders , the other runs the Pioneer Fish Market at the other end of the 
slip. 
As for "Italian -ness," he speaks the language, his sons speak "a 
little." I quote Vito Terzoli on the need for daily pasta , and he responds, 
almost vehemently , that he hasn't eaten pasta in two years. As fort the rest, 
I ought to talk to some othernever-named oldtimers, and even better, I ought 
to talk to the ones that are no longer around. Tough assignment, that. 
Meanwhile , Mike Taormina 's 79th birthday was yesterday (putting his 
birthdate at 7/19/10). He celebrated it "sober" and, you guessed it, behind 
the wheel of his pickup , gazing up the slip. 
Earlier, I stopped by the Maria where a (partial) crew consisting of the 
Sicilian captain and his son, two other Italians , a Slav and a Guatemalan were 
working on replacing their enginge block. Amid the whirr and bang of drills 
and hammers, it was not a good time to get anyone to talk, but I did take a 
few photos -- another Last Supper in the galley . The cap'n's name is Sal 
Ciaramiatoro. He immigrated in 1964. His son is Pete. The engine's been down a 
week and won 't be ready to go for another week, according to the Yugoslav, who 
concedes that there could be worse times to go down than now, this time of the 
full moon and no fish. Still, he says, "you never know when things will break 
loose." We talk about the weather (blessed cool and breezy in SP, bloody hot 
everywhere else ). SP's a peninsula, he explains , but from 20 miles out it 
looks like an island. If you believe that immigrants tend to want to live in 
places that resemble where they came from, it makes sense that the town is 
full of Ischians and Sicilians. What makes even more sense is San Pedran's 
sense of their town as a place apart from Los Angeles.

My interview with Leonard "Lemons" Taormina takes 
place on a hatch cover aboard the tidy little Coquetta, built incidentally, by 
John DiMeglio and in the Taormina family 40 years. Taormina's white head is 
covered by a blue Dodger cap. He sits leaning forward, forearms on his knees, 
rubbing his hands, not looking at me. He has this idea that the tape is 
supposed to be one continuous stream of him talking and makes a game effort at 
it and seems a little nervous, as if he's let me down whenever he lapses into 
silence and forces me to prod him with a question. 
He's 66 (b. 10/3/23 in San Pedro) and has fished "from knee-high until 
today" -- as deck boss on the big tuna boats, mostly. "Today" however, 
consists of an occasional pleasure fishing cruise with his big brother Mike. 
Near the end of hour-long talk, a young fisherman from Santa Barbara comes by, 
interested in buying the Coquetta. Leonard agrees there's no use in the boat 
laying idle, but says it's Mike's call and Mike, as the young guy points out 
and I have observed, seems to like looking at it. I like looking at it too, 
says Leonard, but he's willing to let it go. Until he does ; though, his 
routine is "go to bed early, get up early, go to the coffeeshop to see the 
boys," then putter around on the boat until it's time to eat lunch with his 
buddy Gerrard Fiorentino. "We eat so good all the freeloaders come around to 
eat," says Leonard. Once a week, he starts the boat. Last year, he painted 
"every inch of it." He's a fastidious, non-effusive man, was more relaxed 
talking to the guy from Santa Barbara and may be better served by a tape at 
Fiorentino's shop next week. 
Taormina expresses his scorn for modern fishermen and their gear thus: 
"Nowadays everybody's got a wristwatch and a styrofoam cup." 
T IAW-RF-F072189.B= 
Then there's Joe Canetti, owner of the institution 
known as Canett's Fish Grotto, where the the fishermen gather and drink their 
coffee. "Fishermen catch more fish in Canetti's than they do in the ocean," 
Joe says proudly. He's a large, expansive man, bursting with Italian pride. 
His father was Italian, he says, "but he was always first an American." Mom 
and Dad, Ischians, ran a grocery store at 16th & Mesa, before moving down to 
the slip and adding the restaurant in 1949•. 
Joe's a good source for information on how Italian life has changed over 
the years. The Second World War seems to have been a watershed. Before it, his 
dad made his own wine-and kept it in wine cellar. Before the war there was the 
fiesta of San Gian Giuseppe (featuring a greased pole-walking contest), Sunday 
dinners and cards, eel for Christmas Eve. "The real Italian thing," Joe says, 
"-- it was, but it isn't today." Examples follow: The family business used to 
close 1 p.m; Saturday and reopen Monday to allow for church-going and the big 
family thing on Sunday. Now there's too much competition from 7-day-a-week 
businesses to allow for that. Joe blames the decline of some of the home-based 
traditions on the wives' need to work. 
And yet, Italians in SP "are still strong." The community is diffusing 
through out the economy -- doctors, lawyers, dentists, realtors -- but it is 
not dispersing. Two of Joe's own sons work at the restaurant. A third works on 
barges in the port. The family still eats mostaccioli on Sunday, soup on 
Monday, fish on Friday and steak on Saturday. They still have 50 people over 
for Xmas dinner. The food -- seafood and pasta, mainly -- "would blow your 
brains," Joe says. 
Joe also provided such tidbits as: The oldest son is named after the 
father. The most popular names were always John and Joseph. If you yell "Hey, 
Joe," in the restaurant, he says "you'll get five guys to turn around." The 
Slays painted their houses white with blue trim, the Italians white with green 
trim. Italians could call each other Dagos; the Slays did so at their peril. 
In the early days, most of the fishermen were Ischians. In in the sixties, the 
fishing got bad, there were guys who sank their own boats to collect the 
insurance and a wave of Sicilans arrived to take the place of the upward 
mobile Ischians. "You gotta give them credit," Joe says of the Siciliani. 
"Their kids speak Italian first, English second." Also, "they work. They're 
not like the gangsters in New York." Finally, there are Joe's community 
connections. His godmother is a Trani asin Trani's shoe store on 7th St. 
Sandals are made there. John DiMeglio is his uncle. He introduces me to Ben 
Scott, founder of the Italian-American club, and to his father-in-law, Ralph 
Galante. He points out Joe Cracciola, president of the gill-netters 
association. He reminds me that there's a Saturday morning fish market that's 
open to the public. We'll be there. I've gotta shoot Joe making the day's 
doughnuts at 5 a.m. anyway.

Ben Scott is not an anglicized version of Beniamino 
Scotti. There may not be many Italians in Plentywood , Montana. But Ben Scott 
left Plentywood for San Pedro, met and married Irma Giacopuzzi, and wound up 
organizing the Mazzini Club in 1951, a picnic, dance and dinner outfit named 
for an Italian patriot. Most of the members, like Irma's family, were northern 
Italians -- Veronesi -- dairymen, mostly, who came over in the 1910s and 20s, 
and operated dairies in the southland until the press of development and the 
demand for dockworkers during the Second World War led many of them to switch 
to longshoring. Scott describes these folks as 
large, strong , fun-loving and 
home-loving ." They made their own wine, sauerkraut and sausages, butchered 
hogs and goats , raised chickens and grew vegetables . The northern and southern 
Italians , he says , got along fine, but their lives were separate . Unlike the 
southerners , the northerners were more assimilationist in their orientation, 
unless they 've just been here longer. In any case, he says, it "would be 
difficult -- except when you go to a wedding or a funeral -- to discover they 
have the ethnic 
background they do. As the bond of ethnicity weakened 
determine , Mazzini Club members drifted off to other civic, social and service 
organizations , and the club stopped meeting altogether about five years ago. 
Scott sees this as a good thing, as a sign that the people feel that they 
belong, that "this is their country." 
on their refrigerator is a magnet with the motto "Eat Italian" over a 
send-up of La Giaconda in chef's hat and neckerchief, knife and fork in hand, 
seated at a checkered tablecloth. Northern cuisine is distinguished from 
southern , Scott says , by an emphasis on meat instead of fish, lighter sauces 
on the pasta , more gnocchi than spaghetti, and the eating of lasagna, polenta 
and tortellini . The oldtimers made grappa, brandied cherries and prunes, 
olives.

up it never seems early enough for these 
I met Joe Canetti at the cafe to take 
That done, he introduced me to Joe 
Commercial Fishermen's Association. He's a 
like a tradition than an income," he says. 
The income comes from his contracting business. He does not characterize 
himself as a "traditional Italian" because he married a Slavonian. But his 
father and grandfather were Sicilian fishermen. I ask him if he speaks 
Italian. He says , "I speak Sicilian." His sons do not: "You have to have ties 
in Europe to keep the language up." His dad is 82, uncle, 92. I'm meeting them 
later. 
At one time , he says, there were 125 boats in the slip. In the fifties 
there were about 20 Sicilian boats, 40 Ischian boats and 40 Slavonian boats. 
The fleet grew during the war, then saturated the market after the war. The 
dual problems of pollution and over-fishing began cutting the fleet down to 
size. 
As we chat, the center table begins filling up with fishermen, the 
conversation widens. Some of the talk is of the dangers, especially for the 
little gill-netters. "It doesn't take much weather to break a small boat," 
says a man with a wrinkled nose. Boats get run down by the big tubs in the 
shipping lanes: "You just see pieces of debris floating . A wet net on the 
reel. weighing three tons , destabilizes the boat. The best swordfishing is 
during the worst weather . Cracciolo says four or five boats a year are lost. 
The talk turns to politics and the clout of the sport fishing lobby. 
Cracciolo gives the commercial fleet five years, even with the co -op buying 
its own cannery . "The can costs more than the mackerel," he says The fishermen 
get seven cents a pound for the fish while the cannery pays 25 cents for the 
can. Nets cost $10,000 to $15 ,000. A third of what a boat grosses is poured 
back into boat maintenance. Those who want to keep fishing are forced to move 
around : to fish salmon in Bristol Bay, Alaska , herring in San Francisco. Or 
else they moonlight as fishermen while working days on the longshore

Present are Salvador (Sam) Cracchiolo, his wife 
Antonia (nee D'Aleo ), Sam's brother, Philip and Phil's son , Joe. The interview 
takes place around the dining room table at Sam's and Antonia's house. The 
family is from Terrasini, near Palermo , in Sicily. Fishermen "since the day of 
Christ ." Ending with Joe, age 57 . The brothers, 10 years apart , both left 
Sicily at the age of 16 and headed for Detroit, where they worked as fruit 
peddlars . A relative visiting from San Pedro told them to go west, "California 
is just like Sicily." Phil came out in 1927, Sam in 1937. 
While we 're talking San and Antonia's grandson comes in with his 
Japanese wife and their three kids . They bear two giant squashes (cucutza --
sp.?), which Phil later shoulders like a baseball bat during his tour of 
inspection around Sam 's garden. The wife has learned to cook Italian from 
Antonia. Their little girl kisses her grandpa while pinching both his cheeks -
- an Italian kiss, according to Sam, though Antonia doesn't remember such 
kisses from Sicily. The grandson understands some Italian, but doesn't speak 
it and regrets that he doesn't. He's also an engineer who .regrets that he 
never fished. 
Sam and Phil take turns recounting the circumstances of their leaving 
Sicily (draft evasion, basically ), 
the voyage over (as fishermen they were the 
only ones on the boat to keep eating during the blows), Ellis Island and the 
train trip to Detroit . Neither had any intention of returning to Sicily. "I 
came here to die here," says Phil . When he came to San Pedro, he says there 
were about 20 Sicilians in town, about 100 Italians. The harbor, he says was 
"fish galore ." He and two pals quickly scraped together the dough to buy a 
boat, fished tuna in Mexico , nmackerel locally, the usual thing. On the boat 
they argued about whether the lingua franca should be Italian or English. Phil 
favored English . He retired at 75 (he's 83 now ) and still misses fishing. But 
he's not sentimental about the family tradition. Since you can't make a living 
at it anymore , it doesn't make sense for the new generation of men to take it 
up. 
Sam's and Antonia's house has a red porch and wrought iron railings, 
fruit trees (including a Sicilian fig tree ) and of course, a tomato and squash 
garden.

Trying to line up a fishing trip I run into Joe 
Cracchiolo on board the Linda C., replacing rotted out railing before he goes 
shark fishing in a few weeks time. He brings me to Canetti's and introduces me 
to Tilio Gioiello, skipper of the Sea Star. He's at the double center table 
with Jack Russo, Sal Manzella and Angelo LoGrande, skippers and Sicilians all. 
Gioiello is Ischitano.They were all part of the wartime wave. Manzella came in 
1946, LoGrande in 1940, Gioiello in 1949 and Russo in 1938 -- what appears to 
have ben the second of three waves of Italian immigration to San Pedro, the 
first in the 1910s and 1920s , the second in the 30s and 40s and the third in 
the 50s and 60s. Or has it been a continuous trickle? 
The more recent arrivals do not seem to be proud-to-be-American 
immigrants . These guys have watched the fishing fleet decline while seeing 
Italy recover. "Now it's America there," LoGrande says. Unlike the recent 
arrivals , who have done well, moved up, literally and economically from the 
fishing slip , and would never go back to Italy, Sal Manzella says he would "go 
back to Italy tomorrow" if not for his American wife and his American family. 
"First guy that comes along," says LoGrande, "for half the money the boat is 
worth, I give it to him." But nobody wants it. They complain about Fish & Game 
ever-increasing the size of the gill-net mesh. When that happens, Manzella 
says, miming taking a bill out of his wallet and throwing it away, "a $10,000 
net, I got to take it out and throw it away." They complain of the sport 
fishermen, of the gill-neters getting blamed for the depradation of all manner 
of marine populations, of their wives having to work. "They say fishermen are 
making money ," Manzella say. "Where? Fishermen are making money maybe one day 
a week." They 're glad for the crew of the Sea Scout that caught the 100-year 
tuna, but regret that such a catch reinforces the idea that the fishermen have 
nothing to kick about . "We try to work ," they say. "We not lazy to work." 
Then it gets worse. Russo's son, 35, and grandson, 13, were lost at sea, 
along with two other fishermen last year . He doesn't want to talk about it. 
But he talks about it.

Sunday afternoon on the slip. I hear boats are going 
out, but things seem quiet. I notice for-sale signs on two of the boats, a pit 
bull lounging on the bows of a third, a Bristol Bay, Alaska decal on a fourth, 
guano-streaked skiffs on them all. At the far end of the slip is a monument, 
"Dedicated in Memory of All Fishermen" and humble in the extreme, erected by 
the Women's Auxiliary of the Fishermen's Cooperative Association in 1963. 
Walking back up the other side of the slip, I see action. Anna Maria II 
is getting ready to fish. I take pictures of Paolo DiGirolamo, 34, Francesco 
Cosnetino, 58 and Giuseppe Cracchiolo, 25, all three of whom came from Sicily 
in 1974. When they make Mafia jokes I ask them if it bugs them that people 
assume all Sicilains are Mafiosi. "It don't bother us because we do right 
living," one says. I also ask them if they're sorry they came. The boats, they 
say, are better than the boats here: they're newer. Anna Maria is 50 years old 
and made of wood. The boats in Sicilia are made of steel and there are no 
cockroaches in the kitchen. Anna Maria has a crew of seven Italians and one 
Guatemalan, which, for our purposes, makes it a pretty good candidate for a 
fishing trip. "Maybe we see you tomorrow," one of the crew says as they cast 
off the lines. "Bring you some fish." "Catch some, " I say. "Good luck," says 
Giuseppe. "You need the luck," I say. 
The Santa Teresa is also getting ready. This is the Randazzo boys' boat 
-- Paul and Louis. "My uncle and dad taught everybody to fish here. 
Everybody," says Louie. Uncle Sam, owner of the Nonna Maria II and getting 
ready to go fishing himself, stops by to chat. He's a dapper fellow in 
designer sunglasses, a gold braided baseball cap and a red neckerchief. 
"Fishing'll pick up next month," says Sam. "Water'll be colder." Paul in a 
"Death from Above -- Fish Assassin" cap invites me aboard, offers coffee and a 
ham sandwich. There's a wooden cross in the foc'sle next to a small wooden 
shrine with a likeness of the Virgin in it and a small card with a picture of 
a saint and the motto "St. Jude pray for us." In the galley, "The Last Supper" 
hangs over the table. And in the wheelhouse there's a wooden statuette of the 
Virgin with a beheaded baby Jesus on her shoulder next to a box of explosives 
used to scare seals and otters.

Nothing doing at the cannery on Terminal Island, Ken 
and I head back to the fishing slip for breakfast at Canetti's where we run 
into Joe Cracchiolo and Liberato "Libby" DiBernardo. Libby mentions a fishing 
ground known as "Dago Bank," and talks of his father Ferdinando of the Santa 
Maria who went back and forth between San Pedro and Ischia, getting his wife 
pregnant each time. Built in 1937 and now skippered by Libby's brother 
Carmine, the Santa Maria is the only boat on the slip still in the same 
family. "We spoke Italian on the boat and we spoke Italian at home," Libby 
says. "We speak southern Italian: Ischitan. Okie Dago." 
From Canetti's we go to the fishmarkets -- the 40 thieves as they're 
known to the fishermen. At Pioneer I borrow old family photos from Joe 
DiMeglio, Jr., a babyfaced, cigar-chomping guy who has the Wall Street Journal 
on his desk and says, challengingly, "We were brought up American." An oil 
painting in his office shows a fishing boat being pulled up on the beach by 
oxen 
Then it's on to Ocean Fish Co. for a visit with Stanley DiMeglio, no 
relation to Joe, two doors down. The upstairs conference room at Stan's is a 
miniature nautical museum, including such items as a stack of canned fish, 
Ischian coin trays, ships -in-bottles, a binnacle, a shuip's wheel and some 
panoramic photos of the waterfront. Stan's dad built a business selling wine 
grapes and presses to the Italians. "Everybody made wine here, everybody," 
Stan says. He makes an appointment for me at the home of Anita Basich, nee 
Ardino. Another Ischian, he makes Sicilian jokes: "we say they're Sicilians, 
not Italians," and, "When the Lord made the Massina Straits (which separate 
Sicily from the mainland) he should've pumped in more water and swamped the 
island." For the most part, he says, the Italians lived on vinegar Hill, so 
named because the Italians would take the pulp left over from grape crushing 
and sprinkle it on their gardens. While we chat the St. Katherine pulls in and 
begins unloading 50 or 60 tons of mackerel. Immediately, the pelicans and the 
oldtimers appear -- the Taormina brothers, Barcott. "The oldtimers come to get 
fre fish," DiMeglio says. "We never refuse 'em." A large power-block operated 
scoop net is used to dump the fish into bins which are winched onto the dock. 
Eventually, they'll switch over to a suction pump like the one used at the 
cannery. 
While we're out on the balcony, Barcott says to me, 
"I know it's the 
oldest family in San Pedro, but keep away from that guy." DiMeglio spots 
Isidoro Amalfitanoskipper of the Sea Scout, and invites him to chat. 
Amalfitano came to the U.S. in 1966 from Ischia. When I ask hiim how far back 
fishing goes in his family he says, "Generation by generation by generation, 
we pass it on." His grandmother used to go on the beach and help the guys pull 
the boat on the shore. "When I was six years old," he says, "I had to go to 
fish to help my father. I had to be on the boat. I had to sleep on the boat. 
School was the second thing. The first thing was to support the family." 
Amalfitano, short, curly-haired, handsome and powerful-looking, tells 
his story of jumping ship in New Jersey, meeting his wife-to-be while he 
worked at his uncle's restaurant in Poughkeepsie, getting caught by 
immigration after 17 days and being refused by his wife's father when he 
sought to marry her before being deported back to Ischia. After a year-and-a-
half of letter-writing, his wife's family brought her back to Ischia for toe 
wedding. Of his return to the states he says, "Thank God -- I kiss the ground. 
Both Stan and Isidoro talk about their fathers, how "one look" was all 
it took. Their fathers never hit their kids. They also talk about how eine was 
always on the table and how kids were introduced to wine via pieces of bread 
that were dipped into it. 
"I'm an American," Isidoro says again. "Thank God I'm in a place where I 
can eat a piece of bread." 
When Isidoro leaves -- I arrange to see him that evening -- Stan and I 
go back out on the balcony. St. Katherine's catch are jack mackerels, he tells 
me, also known as Spanish mackerel. "These fish don't have a chance," he says. 
"Nylon net, power block, spotter plane ... It's a hard life but a good life. 
You're free. You're self-contained." Znd he ends with a joke about all the 
ways the fishermen find to evade the regulations: "The priest says, 'How come 
you don't go to confession?' And the fisherman says, 
'If I confess to you 
you'd go into the fishing business."'

Anita Basich's claim to fame is that her grandparents, 
Giovanni and Angiolina Carrese were the first Italians to settle in this part 
of the world, coming first to Wilmington in 1880. This is confirmed by a 
commemorative booklet put out in 1949 to mark the 60th anniversary of Mary 
Star of the Sea Church. Anita's mother, Brigit Carrese was Stan DiMeglio's 
grandmother. Her father was Joe Ardina, who worked in the coal mines of 
Colorado and the lumberyards of San Pedro before he began selling wine grapes 
to the Italians. This business was carried on by Stan DiMeglio's father. A lot 
of the wine-making, Anita says, went on during the full moon in the fall when 
it was too bright to see the fish. 
When she was growing up, she says, "people visited more. For the Italian 
people the main thing always on Sunday was spaghetti and meatballs and also 
eggplant parmesan." The last Sunday in August they celebrated the fiesta of 
San Giovan Giuseppe della Croce, which included a week-long carnival that 
concluded with fireworks. In Ischia, the story is told, the statue of San 
Giovan Giuseppe was brought out during a storm and the sea was calmed. 
Christmas Eve was, and still is, a fish and seafood dinner. Christenings 
featured acordion music and tarantella dancing. dinner. The Fishermen's Fiesta 
featured a parade of flag-bedecked boats. She has film footage of it. 
I ask her about being a fisherman's wife -- she married a Slav, John 
Bacich. "I used to dread to see him go," she says, "just dread it." Her son 
would get sick. "My husband never encouraged him to be a fisherman because 
that's a hard life." Instead, he's a microbiologist living in Glendale. "I'm 
just a full American," Anita says. "I was born here and I love this country."

DiBernardo Realty is a family business. Working the 
phones in an office dominated by pictures of the family fishing boat, the 
Santa Maria, are brothers Louie and Libby, Libby's son Fred and brother 
Carmine's son Mark. Looking down from the backwall is the patriarch, 
Ferdinando, age 91. This is another Ischian family. The grandfather worked in 
the coral trade on sailing ships to Africa. Ferdinando came to the states in 
1915 at age 17 having heard that San Pedro,harbor "was a great fishing 
village." In those early days the fishing was with lampara nets. In 1920, 
Ferdinando was married back in Italy and then began several years of 
transoceanic commuter conjugality. Finally, it occurred to the old man that he 
was giving all his money to the train and steamship companies and so in 1937 -
- 22 years after he first came to the states -- he brought the family back 
with him. Today there are 225 members of the DiBernardo extended family in San 
Pedro 
Libby started fishing at age 13: "You wanted to do what your dad did." 
During World War II, he says, "you could walk on the fish out there." The glow 
of fish in the ocean at night "looked like a lit -up city." His father couldn't 
fish because he wasn't a citizen. His sister worked at one of the canneries. 
Libby quit fishing in 1964 and became a realtor. The pattern held when his son 
followed him into real estate. Libby married an Irish girl, his son a 
Yugoslay. Their office is a half a block from the house Libby grew up in. 
Above Gaffey St. back then was "all rabbit hunting." It was also where the 
fishermen spread out their cotton nets for tarring. The Italian fleet "liked 
to stay close to home and see mama everyday." 
Like Joe Canetti's household, the DiBernardos ate certain foods on 
certain days of the week: soup on Saturdays, mostacchioli on Sunday ("That was 
automatic"), pasta fazoul on Mondays. The family made its own tomato sauce, 
ravioli, gnocchi, baked its own bread, raised rabbits, chickens and ducks. On 
San Giovan Giuseppe's day they 
donated to the fiesta in Ischia. The 
fishermen's fiesta started in 1946, "fishing's heyday." The statue of the 
Blessed Virgin would be carried down to the docks for the blessing of the 
fleet. During a dryspell, the priest would be called on to bless the boat. His 
mother used to burn incense and recite prayers to rid the house of the evil 
eye. On another saint's day -- Libby can't recall whose -- the family would 
leave a pot of water with flowers in it outside overnight and wash their faces 
in the water the following morning. There were saints for different parts of 
the body: St. Blaise for the throat, St. Lucia for the eyes. 
After the interview, brother Carmine, skipper of the Santa Maria, stops 
by. I ask if Libby ever comes out fishing anymore. "Now and then," Carmine 
says. "When he comes he puts his boots on. He comes to work." As for his son 
Mark, "I wanted something better for him.

After supper at Isidoro Amalfitano 's house. We sit at 
the dining room table, his kids three of his four kids and a couple of nephews 
from New York listening in. His wife brings us espressos. Isidoro, skipper of 
the SeaScout , is Ischian, 49 years old. He came to the states in 1964, jumping 
ship and meeting his bride to be before being nailed by immigration and 
deported back to Italy . 
When he returned he tried working construction in 
Poughkeepsie , where his wife's family settled, but "being a fisherman, you 
can't get away . 
Once you're a fisherman you're a fisherman for life." In 
Italy, he says the saying is that you have "saltwater in your veins." "You can 
never take a fisherman out of the water," says his wife, Rose . "It's like 
trying to take a fish out of the water." Isidoro 's uncle Frank (Dodger coach 
Joe's father ) skippered the City of Naples, now called the Santa Teresa, the 
Randazzo brothers ' 
boat. Isidoro talks of how hard it was for his family 
during the fishermen 's six-month strike for better prices in 1967. "Work is no 
shame," he says. And in Italian: "Work makes the man noble." English: "Pride 
doesn't fill up your stomach." 
On raising the kids Italian: "We like them to be Italian . 
We like them 
to be proud of what they are." His oldest son is named after his father, as is 
customary . His youngest son is named Antonio as per a promise he made to St. 
Anthony when he was sick with colitis. The older kids are still living with 
the family : "We don't believe children should leave home if they're not 
married. That's the Italian way." He talks about how hard it is not to spoil 
children in this land of plenty. 
Other Italian family traditions: building a nativity scene for 
Christmas . Christmas eve dinner consists of lobster , crab, clams, crab salad, 
shrimp, spaghetti , calamari , bacalao and octopus. On Easter they bless the 
boat with a palm picked on Palm Sunday. 
Dining room decor includes a picture of a sailor at a ship's wheel with 
Christ's guiding hand on his shoulder and a ship's wheel clock . 
They have 
tapes of Neapolitan music and play one, for my listening pleasure. I try 
coaxing a song out Isidoro and almost get one out of Antonio , but they chicken 
out. When I leave I push my chair under the table and am told that this isn't 
done in Italy : it means you 're not coming back.

Interview with Frank Iacono while waiting for the 
Vittorio to come in at United Food Processing, the cannery bought a couple of 
years back by the Fishermen's Co-op, whose membership roster, boat and 
skipper, looks like this: Anna Maria II, Jim D'Amato; Astronaut, Mike Trama; 
Aggressor, Anthony Tipich; Donna B, James Bunn; Ferrigno Boy, Joe Ferrigno; G. 
Nazzereno, Salvatore Russo; Laurie Ann, Anton Stanojevich; Margaret F, Antonio 
Ingrande; Maria, Sal Ciaramitaro; Maria T,.Vito Terzoli; Mauritania, Nick 
Mosich; Nancy Jean, Mario Carollo; St. Restituta II, Nino Palma; St. George 
II, Frank Vuoso; Sea Queen, Vincent Porpora; Sea Scout, George Pisano; Tootur, 
Sam Russo; Vittorio, Peter Fiore; Bimbo, Tony Marinkovich; St. Joseph, Joe 
Terzoli. 
Iacono, former g.m. of the Co-op is now v.p. of the cannery. Unlike 
other Ischians, he is not from a fishing family. His grandfather was a tailor 
and led the island's orchestra. His father came over in 1911 and worked in San 
Pedro's lumberyards before becoming a fruit peddlar. Mom worked in a cannery. 
Dad was a pianist. Frank played violin, clarinet and piano, but no longer. He 
started fishing before the war, bought his own boat after it, introduced the 
first nylon net in SP. 
I 
His wife's Slavonian,'has three kids. The oldest boy understands 
Italian, works in an automotive shop, didn't like fishing. The youngest boy 
works as an air spotter, crashed on Catalina Island, was missing 17 hours, now 
in real estate. 
The height of the fishing, says Frank, was 1947. There were 300 boats 
during sardine season. During the Fishermen's Fiesta the boats were decorated 
in 
crepe flowers and each family was assigned to bring a certain food. 
Co-op history. The co-op was started in 1927, by Slays mostly. The 
Italians had the Italian Federated Boat Owners. The two groups merged in 1947. 
The co-op acted as a bargaining agent with the canneries, of which there 25 at 
one time. The co-op building was dedicated in 1937. The co-op bought the 
Starkist cannery in 1987. If it had closed, Frank says, "it would have been 
the death blow to the fleet." Sardines began declining in the mid-50s; Frank 
hung on until 1979. He doesn't miss it. "If I see the breakwater I close my 
shades." But now he says there aremore sardines than there were before. When 
he tells me that the fleet, including the boats in Fish Harbor on Terminal 
Island numbers 35 seiners and 50 gillnetters, I realize that the count I'm 
usually given (by purse seiners) includes seiners only. The gillnetters don't 
even count. 
At interview's end we go down to wait for the Vittorio. The cannery 
workers, Hispanic, mostly, wear white hard hats and eat snacks bought from a 
catering truck while waiting for the boat to come in. The ground is littered 
with bits of sea urchin. A fat, green, pulsating vaccuum tube sucks the fish 
out of the hold. As they ride up the chute under the eyes of a couple of Fish 
& Game inspectors, Frank pulls three fish out to show me the different 
species: sardines, jack r Spanish mackerel and Pacific mackerel. The Fish & 
Gamers put samples in plastic bags. The Vittorio's load is 10 tons. Frank 
calls the St. George, due in at 11 a.m., and arranges for Ken and me to go 
fishing.

Crew of the St. George : Gaspar Russo, Sicilian, came 
to the states 1948, born 1929; Joseph Giacolone, chief engineer, born in San 
Diego in 1927; Mario Scotto, the cook, born in Naples in 1942, came to the 
states (jumping ship in Long Beach) in 1968; Chris Pisano, born in SP in 1963 
to Ischian parents; Ciro Lauro, born in Ischia in 1935, came to the states in 
1960; Giuseppe LoGrande, born in Sicily in 1946, came to the states in 1969; 
Oscar Aramburo, born in Mazatlan in 1956, the only non-Italian in the crew. 
Also along for the ride is Mario's son Paolo, age 15. A future fisherman? "No 
way," says Mario. "He's gonna be a doctor." 
I wonder at these guys going fishing again at 3 after coming in at 11. 
What about sleep. "You sleep when you're not sleepy, you eat when you're not 
hungry," says Giacolone. While Russo and Lauro mend net, I chat with Chris, 
the youngest member of the crew. He began fishing after school and during the 
summer at age 10. "It's just in the blood," he says. "Once it gets in the 
family, that's it." He'll take bad weather on the ocean over fighting traffic 
and wearing a tie any day. His mom told him fishing was a bad life, taking you 
away from your family all the time. His dad said, do what you want. "First it 
was fun. Now I got a family. I got to do it to catch fish. Now it's do or die. 
Still, a lot of it is for joy." Indicating Russo and Lauro at the nets he 
says, "These guys are the pros. These guys are the masters who've been here 
forever. They know everything inside out." 
Lauro describes Ischia as "a beautiful island." LoGrande says he's been 
fishing since he was born. And advises me to be loose to fend off seasickness. 
"We are the real Italians," says Giacolone. "We're Sicilians." 
No sooner do we cast off and glide out the slip than Mario starts on his 
salad for dinner and Ciro carves a yellowtail caught the night before. Joe 
sets up the barbecue on the hatch cover. In the galley is a plaque with the 
motto, "God Bless Our Floating Home," a wooden crucifix, a print of St. George 
slaying the dragon, an L.A. Dodger wall calendar, and a TV and VCR. As wemotor 
out into the shipping channel, Lauro, LoGrande and Captain Frank sit on the 
bridge, shades and ballcaps on, quietly gazing out. On the bulletin board 
inside the wheelhouse is a print of St. Ciro, a channel buoy guide and a 
Dodgers schedule. Frank, a handsome, softspoken man, tells me his grandfather, 
who had been a cabin boy on squareriggers, was one of the first fishermen in 
San Pedro. One of the windows of the wheelhouse is a stained glass anchor made 
by Mike Vuoso's wife. A third brother works on the Catalina ferry. A brother-
in-law is normally the skiffman, though he is not with us this night. Chris 
will take his place. St. George is the patron saint of Testacchio, the town in 
Ischia the family's from. The boat is 50 years old. I ask Mike about all the 
teasing that goes on between the Pschians and the Sicilians. "Deep down," he 
says, "they know they're Italians and Italians are paisanos." 
The table is set for dinner. Mario has put out a plate of cold cuts and 
cheese, Ritz crackers, and bottles of J&B, Seagrams 7 and Seagrams VO. It's 
cocktail hour. When I say something about how well they treat themselves, Mike 
says, "We spend as much time here as we do at home." As boatowners, he says, 
they take no risks. "Our philosophy is, there's always tomorrow -- which is 
probably why we've lasted so long." At 5:30 he puts the yellowtail steaks on 
the grill and talks about the crew as a big family. It turns out this crew is 
a brand new family: Gaspar and Giuseppe just joined it. "Don't forget the 
garlic," says Gaspar. "What can you eat better than fish? 
Dinner is served: yellowtail, salad, garlic bread, cantelope and a 
German chocolate cake made by somebody's wife. Everyone sits down together, 
but each crewman begins eating as soon as his plate is full. In other words, 
no grace-saying or anything like that. The owners eat with the crew. After 
dinner, most of the crew goes into the foc'sle for naps. While watching the 
Dodger game on TV, Paolo, the future doctor, asks my interview questions for 
me. Says Mike: "You see us barbecuing, watching TV, relaxing and it looks like 
a nice life. But we're not making any money. Sometimes the whole ocean is like 
a big lake. No traffic jams, no freeways, beautiful sunsets. While our 
families are sleeping we're seeing schools of fish that are city blocks big. 
Paolo asks about the differences between fishing for tuna, say, and mackerel.

Mike says tuna are hardest because they 're fastest and smartest. "You have to 
use your instincts . You search for birds , you search for bait, you smell the 
air. The hardest thing about catching mackerel is finding them. They don't 
swim fast . Mackerel pays the bills. It's a big ocean , Paolo. You got to go a 
long way to find the fish." 
Dark. Mike points out the Exxon Valdez, lit up like a ballpark. Passing 
in the lea of San Clemente Island, six hours out from Pedro, Mike says, "When 
my dad was alive he said, 
'This is my island. I always catch fish here."' 
The boat slows and the change of rhythm wakes the crew. It's time to 
look for fish. Frank draws the curtains in the galley to keep the fish in the 
dark, then climbs to the crows nest while Mike stations himself on the bridge 
to monitor the sonar and the fathometer . 
We begin circling. The older guys, 
Gaspar and Ciro, in flannel shirts and ballcaps, chat in Italian. The fish 
register on the sonar visually and sonically as red pinpoints and bip-bip-
bips . Frank tells Mike at the wheel to turn left or right as he shines his 
lantern over the school. Scattered , Mike says again and again. Maybe 10 or 15 
tons. Since this may be as good as it gets, the bell is rung , the skiff is 
launched and the net fans out around the boat. The boat, which had been dark 
is suddenly brilliantly, theatrically lit. Most of the crew, in yellow and 
orange slickers and silver and blue hardhats, is on the stern pulling and 
arranging the net, floats and chains, streaming water, as they come off the 
power block. As the fish become ever more concentrated in the ever-shrinking 
purse, seals appear and take after the escapees. All pursed up, the fish 
sizzle like potatoes in a fryer . The transfer from purse to hold is 
accomplioshed through the agency of a giant butterfly which is scooped by hand 
through the purse, lifted by the block into psition over the hatch, then 
lifted from the back so that the fish are poured out of it. After several such 
scooping operations, Frank announces that the haul has been better than 
expected: 30 tons . 
Another set like it and we can all go home. All the gear is

Stan DiMeglio takes me on a whirlwind tour of SP, 
pointing out the greatest concentrations of Italians between 9th and 11th 
streets below Pacific, at one point telling me, "This is a cousin, this is a 
cousin, this is a cousin, this is an uncle..." He means "was." The second 
generation, he says, "they elevated themselves, they moved up to the top of 
the hill." On 8th St. between Pacific and Gaffey he says, "I could name every 
family on the block." The area around Mesa and 18th was known as Vinegar Hill 
because teh Italians used to take the pulp leftover from their winemaking an d 
dump it in their gardens. The first Catholic Church was on 9th St. near 
Centre. DiCarlo's Bakory was where the bowling alley is now on 8th. The area 
around 3rd St. and Bellmarin was inahbited by northern Italians. 
B.A.B., I 
learn, stood for Bare Ass Beach on Terminal Island. His mother was born at 
Mesa and 6th. The City Fish Market was at 631 Mesa. 
His own house has been in the family since 1922. Stan maintains his 
mother's porcelain collection and her bedroom. He talks about her cooking, 
thus: "Mom used to fry steaks until Dad threw the frying pan out the window," 
saying, "'Now we're going to learn to cook.'" Later, his father would say the 
best restaurant in town is 784 11th St. The house still has the old fashioned 
cellar doors.

John DiMeglio cutting up a rock cod. He agrees to help me with some photo 
ID's. Looking at a picture of some oldtimers playing cards on a fish crate, he 
says, "They played pinochle 40-50 years ago. Now, no more. The young guys 
don't take after the old people." 
On a picture of the Los Angeles Wholesale Fish Market: "The fish used to

Stan DiMeglio calls to tell me I kept him up until 
11:30 the night before rummaging through cartons of photos in his cellar, so 
naturally I dash over to see what he's come up with. Good stuff: turn of the 
century portraits of Pedro's first Italian families, many wedding pictures, 
DiCarlo Bakery 's wagon. Stan starts haphazardly identifying who's who, but 
both of us quickly see that a more systematic approach is called for so he 
calls upon his office manager, Lucy DiLeva, herself from an old Italian 
family, and Anita Basich, to help. The three don 't always agree on the 
identities of those pictured , but they arrive at a consensus on most of them 
and provide character references on some. Anita swears that Stan has her

Ferdinando DiBernardo's 91st birthday party. Libby 
greets us at the door and says something like, "You gotta see this. There's 
rabbits, chickens, birds." There are. The house is actually a "family 
compound" of three houses and two outbuildings, with virtually every inch of 
ground planted with vegetables or fruit trees. Italians hate grass, says 
Libby. One of the outbuildings is full of birdcages which are full of birds, 
parakeets, mainly. These are the hobby of Ferdinando's youngest son Fred, the 
lawyer, whom Ferdinando calls a bacalao -- salted codfish, meaning, 
apparently, a crazy person. A portion of the building is a workshop, but is 
also where a wine cask is stored. The other outbuilding, where tables are set 
up for the barbecued shrimp and swordfish to come, is decorated with about 25 
plaques awarded to Fred by some bird fanciers' society. The brass ship's wheel 
over the fireplace is the original wheel from the Santa Maria. There are about 
50 people at the party -- not bad considering it was only planned two days 
before. Libby, keenly aware that we are his responsibility, loads up plates of 
swordfish, shrimp and fried eggplant, so what we mainly do for the hour we're 
there, is eat.

1890-vintage pix of the waterfront; circa 1930 block-and-tackle mounted on a 
board and inscribed "To a Great Guy - Joe Canetti"; a ship-in-bottle and a 
square-rigged ship model on shelves; oil paintings of fishing boats; war bond 
posters; a poster of the varieties of fish to be found off the coast of

Before we sit down for a formal interview, Ferdinando 
DiBernardo takes us on a tour of his vegetable garden, his rabbit hutch and 
his chicken coop. At one point he breaks into a trot, which impresses us, 
considering his age. He's 91. 
Paola does the interview in Italian, which frees me to write notes and 
more closely monitor the recording. On a credenza in the sort of family room 
at the back of the house where the interview takes place, is a photo of 
Ferdinando superimposed over a photo of his beloved Santa Maria, both of which 
have been given the metallic sheen of old letterpress printing plates and 
mounted on wood. The whole presentation is inscribed: "To Uncle Ferdinando, 
Mr. San Pedro Commercial Fisherman. May Your Leadership and Dedication Be a 
Challenge for others to Follow. In Celebration of Your 90th Birthday. July 29, 
1988." The room's decor also includes framed black and white photos of the 
Santa Maria and its predecessor, the Santa Luci, and prints of Amalfi. Now and 
then a parrot in a corner cage calls "Filomena," the name of Ferdinando's 
second wife. In the annex where last night's birthday dinner was held, son 
Louie gives son John a haircut. Filomena serves coffee and cookies. 
Ferdinando pretty much sticks to Italian, but his son Libby switches 
back and forth, enabling me"to catch such bits as: that as a family of eight 
they lived in a two-bedroom apartment when Ferdinando first brought everyone 
over; that Ferdinando was drawn to San Pedro by the intelligence that "the 
climate is a lot like the island (Ischia) we're from"; that in those days (the 
thirties) "you could walk on the fish." "Big story, signorina, big story," 
Ferdinando says to Paola in an unexpected burst of English. 
The old fishermen, Libby says, "were masters of the nets ... I saw my 
father working and I couldn't keep up with him. He was like an animal, you 
know. An animal." Coming in during a fog, in the days before Loran and 
fathometers, says Libby, you'd "make your boat dead in the water, listen for 
the foghorn, Moanin' Maggie," and drop a leadline to gauge the water's depth. 
At my prompting, Paola asks why the San Pedro boats lack the decorative 
touches of their Italian counterparts. Libby says they're "barco di lavoro --
they're work boats. You don't make 'em pretty. They don't go for beauty. They 
go for weight and fish." The Santa Maria, he says, is the high boat -- "the 
high liner" year after year. Last year, he says, Carmine's deckhands made 
$80,000, a figure that astonishes me. The Santa Maria, says Ferdinando, was 
named after Columbus's little ship. 
Ferdinando retired around 1966-67, but continued mending nets for his 
son Carmine, who replaced him as skipper of the Santa Maria. He's got 25 
grandchildren, many of whom gather, along with their parents and their 
children, at Ferdinando's and Filomena's on Friday nights.

I arrive as Andy takes Doug on a diagramming tour of 
his vegetable garden. His son Frankie (Francesco), dressed in skateboarder's 
garb, shows me the cars and trucks that belong to the guys who live across the 
street. His wife Margherita returns from the supermarket bearing pizza 
toppings. Andy fires up the forno, which he has just built of brick and 
covered with cement in a corner of the carport of his 1930-era house. There's 
a problem getting the first pizza off the paddle and into the oven until flour 
is sprinkled on the paddle. When the first pie comes out -- too thick of 
crust, slightly underdone, but nevertheless pretty good pizza -- Andy is 
nothing less than overjoyed. I don't think I've ever seen an adult so happy. 
"Right now I'm the best man in San Pedro." 
We taste and toast and then the experiments begin, the upshot of which 
are that a thinner crust and a cooler oven will yield a better pizza. Or as 
Andy puts it, 
"You need not too much fire and take more time." Also, an inch 
needs to be shaved off the paddle so it won't have to be wiggled in the oven 
door: Andy is unfazed by the failures: "We learn by make mistakes," he says. 
The experiments also consist of such pizza variants as foccacia and faccia 
vecchia (old face), which is topped with anchovy, mushrooms, mozzarella and a 
sauce of raw grated tomatoes, olive oil and either basil or oregano, I didn't 
catch which. Every so often Andy uses a wet broom to sweep the ashes to one 
side. He wants to call his aunt to crow about his success, but she's not home. 
A neighbor drops by for a taste. "That's a dream come true," Andy tells her. 
"That's my dream." The neighbor's boy, Frankie's friend, says his piece isn't 
cooked. Frankie and Joanna (Giovanna) go off skateboarding. Another neighbor, 
Margherita tells Andy, wanted to know if the oven was legal. Someone asks 
about garlic. "No," says Andy, "I want to sleep closer to my wife tonight." 
When all the pizzas are cooked, about 10 all told, we adjourn to the 
dining room for dinner. Along with the pizzas are a salad of garden-grown 
green beans, mint leaves, tomatoes and olives, some fried chicken filets, 
wine, beer and Pepsi. We are expected to stay until midnight, or thereabouts 
and listen to Dean Martin sing "Amore" while we drink our espresso, but only 
make it until 10 o'clock.

Ernesto Fortino's winery is a breath-taking American 
success story. When he came to the states in late 1959 he pruned vines in 
winter and worked at the Felice and Parelli Cannery (now California Canning) 
in the summer. Then he worked at a lumberyard in Santa Cruz, became partner in 
a liquor store/tasting room in Monterey, and purchased his winery in 1970. 
Today he's got a 9,000 square-foot house and a top-of-the-line Mercedes. 
This is crush-time at the wineries. Between that, and a party planned 
for 9/9, we were surprised when the boss told us come right over. He and his 
daughter Teri, 21, shoved all the party preps to one side and we set up in the 
-winery kitchen. "I built every inch of this place," he told us as we fussed 
with the sound levels. 
The story he told of us his family's immigration to the U.S. was an 
unusual. The first stop, for his Calabrian father and grandfather, winemakers 
both, was Pittsburgh, Kansas, where they worked as coal miners. His patriotic 
dad went back to Italy to serve in the army; in doing so, he lost his American 
citizenship. He wouldn't get it back for about 40 years. His uncle and cousins 
were the ones who trekked west to Gilroy. His father became a U.S. citizen 
again in 1959. Ernesto, who had`been working at a sawmill in France, joined 
him in Gilroy a month later. He explained his French stint this way: "Italy 
was a beautiful country, but the resources were always limited. We worked and 
worked and worked and never got anywhere." He was also tired of the iwne 
business, which he had grown up in. 
In the Santa Clara Valley there were quite a few families from his home 
town of Donnici. It was easy, therefore, to get work in the vineyards. 
"Pruning, planting, grafting. We done it for years back in Italy. We couldn't 
speak English, but we were able to do the work." His starting wages were 95 
cents an hour. 
His family -- there were five of them -- stayed with his aunt at first, 
then Ernesto, working three jobs, was able to buy a house for $15,000 on the 
site of Gilroy's present City Hall. 
Then came the years in Santa Cruz and Monterey, and purchase of the 
winery on the Hecker Pass Highway. The place was a dump, he says, and the 
whole family went to work on it. His kids, ages 4 and 2, 
"slept under the 
vines" while the adults worked. They started small, but the wine was "superb" 
and the customers came back. "Only in America, I was able to do what we did," 
he says. Today, he's got 65 acres of grapes and a capacity of 230,000 gallons 
of 22 different kinds of wine. 
(Reds are the spcialty of the house.) They no 
longer stomp the grapes -- he showed us the crushing machine later -- and they 
test as well as taste the grapes for sugar content at picking time, but 
winemaking, he says, "is not really laboratory work. It's an art." When I 
asked him which aspect of winemaking demanded the most artistry he said, "the 
whole process is an art." But the trickiest part is knowing how to prevent 
spoilage. "The air is the enemy of the wine." The key is keeping the tanks 
full. 
I should interject here that this is a man well pleased with his life 
and himself. He's got the time to be a gracious host, the lines around his 
Billy Joel eyes are laugh lines; he smiles all the time. He's 53 years old. 
I got him to provide a month-by-month description of the winemaker's 
year: pruning in January and February, plowing and disking in April, cleaning 
the vines (removing excess growth) in May and June, picking in September, 
followed by fermentation, with bottling in December. "Without my say-so," he 
said impressively, "nobody picks grapes." The picking is still done by hand, 
with curved knives. The problem with a picking machine, he confided, is that 
it gets the rats and snakes whose misfortune it is to be crawling and creeping 
around on the vinbes when the machine makes its pass. This year, 20 tons were 
crushed on Sept. 1. One interesting thing about his operation is that it uses 
no water. Dry farming, it's called. 
Saturday's party -- staunch customers pay $25 for dinner of pasta con 
pesto, barbecued steaks, wine, coldcuts and cheese, but get half off on a case 
of wine -- is the American version of the crush-time parties in Calabria, 
where everyone would pick and cursh at everyone else's vineyard and every 
night there would be a dinner and music and dancing. Ernesto played accordion 
in a band that played these parties. Here, he admitted, things are more 
commercial. 
He told us a little about life on the farm in Calabria, how the family 
dried figs and fava beans, made olive oil, kept goats and cows and made 
cheese, kept hogs and made sausage and ham. It was a self-sustaining farm. The 
only things they bought were tobacco, salt, shoes and clothes. Here they grow 
tomatoes, beans, cucumbers, anise. His wife, Marie, is a great cook. She's 
Sicilian. Her father was (is?) a Monterey Bay fisherman. 
We're invited to the crush party. There'll also be a Western band and 
dancing til midnight. He's very proud that he can throw such a bash and 300 
people will turn out, but he's also grateful to the Italians who came to the 
Santa Clara Valley before him and paved the way. 
After the interview we repaired to the deli (there's also a tasting room 
and a "European boutique" that offers wedding and baby shower gifts --
daughter Teri's idea) where Teri fixed us an assortment of bread and an 
assortment of cold cuts and Ernesto broke out one of his private reserve 
Burgundys. While we ate an oldtimer in western hat and boots, known to Tei and 
her pop came in asking if they needed any produce. Father deferred to daughter 
on this one: "She's the boss," he said. "I only work here." Teri took a bag of 
onions and in exchange, gave the farmer a bottle of Burgundy. 
After lunch, Ernesto and then son Gino, 23, took us on a tour of 
crusher, fermentation tanks, storage tanks and bottling room, we got to meet 
Marie and take pictures of very blue grapes, ripe for the picking. We called 
it five hours well spent.

Al Gagliardi comes to the door in red suspenders and 
stockinged feet , a bald-headed guy with an extraordinary collection of 
ballcaps . We sit on the living room sofa opposite twin pix of circus clowns 
and Al tells us about his family. Mainly , he tells us about his dad, an 
extraodinary figure who built cabinets , raised chickens, grew prunes and was 
obsessed with acquiring land . Old Frank Gagliardi left Calabria in 1899 and 
booked passage to Sao Paolo , Brazil because he wanted to avoid military 
service and the U.S. immigrant quota was already filled for the year. The 
trans-Atlantic fare was forty bucks . "' I came with the cattle,'" he later told 
his son 
Frank spent seven years in Brazil, cabinet-making , and after the S.F. 
earthquake in '06, he decided to come to that city to help it rebuild. It 
didn't need his help, apparently , so he moved on to Spokane, Wash. There he 
met his wife , an Italian from Priest River, Idaho , where her folks had 
homesteaded for a time . The couple moved to San Jose in 1922, eventually 
buying a 10 -acre ranch north of Gilroy. At the age of 75 he moved again, to 
Mexico, where he died shortly after his 90th birthday. 
Al's memories of growing up on that ranch are richly detailed, though 
not particularly fond. Because they raised chickens, he says, "I ate eggs and 
chicken every which way you could think about em -- stewed , fried, barbecued, 
cacciatore ." Chicken and spaghetti were "the main staples." Eggs and fryers 
were sold right off the ranch , but the money was in the eggs . Al calls the 
work "tough , but rewarding." 
Being Italian was tough too, though not as tough as it was in 
predominantly Scandinavian Spokane . "Being Italian then," Al says, "was like 
being Mexican now." Being both a Dago and a farmer 's son meant there were "two 
strikes" against him. A surprising revelation, given how overwhelmingly 
agricultural this area is. Partly as a result of this anti-Italian feeling, 
partly because this is the way of the second generation , according of Al. he 
and his age mates tried to "disassociate themselves" from their Italian-ness. 
His wife not being Italian makes his kids half-Italian and his grandkids only 
a quarter : "The Italian is gone." He cites Val Filice as an "Italian Italian" 
and illustrates what he means by gesturing broadly . But later he admits that 
"some of the cooking and philosophy stays with you." 
I had to agree that Al didn't seem or sound all that Italian -- until he 
took us out back. There, he had his apple , olive and apricot trees , his prunes 
drying, a small statue of a saint ("A little protection doesn't hurt"), his 
mother 's ravioli rolling pin and his father's cabinet maker's tools. "Some 
things you can't give up of your heritage," he says, "like I like to garden 
and I like spaghetti ." He seemed apologetic about his chosen career -- Santa 
Clara County sheriff's deputy --and his having retired after 30 years at the 
age of 53 suggested that he was happiest puttering around in his toolshed and 
his backyard. 
During the interview he added tidbits about his mon working summers in 
the cannery, about stuffing prunes with almonds or walnuts as Christmas 
presents ; about Sons of Italy barbecues before the war when his father 
blasphemed about Mussolini who at that time was appreciated for "making the 
trains run on time,"; and about Sunday dinners when the family made bread and 
ravioli, killed chickens , and picked carrots, chard, chickory and fava beans.

I immediately liked everything about Teresa Filice. I 
liked her 1920's house with her beauty shop (she closed it only four years 
ago) on the front and side porches , her rose-patterned area rugs and her 
stylish pageboy haircut, checked flannel shirt and long, full blue skirt. Her 
niece Mimi Filice was on hand, ostensibly to help out, but she wound up 
contributing quite a bit herself. 
Teresa's dad's nephews -- Biscaglia boys -- were the pioneers in this 
family, coming from Calabria around 1890 and starting a cannery first in 
Paradise Valley, then in Morgan Hill and finally in Gilroy. The Santa Clara 
Valley, she said, remanded them of home. Her father , Giuseppe, came in 1906 
bearing seeds from the olives , figs and grapes he grew for the landlord in 
Calabria. He bought 25 acres in Morgan Hill, planted a vineyard on it, moved 
to Gilroy in 1919 and planted a vineyard there. During prohibition he switched 
to "ranching " -- which, in the west can mean farming as well as raising 
livestock. Neither of Teresa's parents ever learned English, but Mimi said 
Giuseppe was "like a computer " the way he was able to calculate everyone's 
wages in his head. 
As a girl, Teresa picked prunes and peaches and "sold 'em on the 
highway." She also worked in the Filice and Parelli (sp?) Cannery. So did 
Mimi, starting at the age of 12. The information they supplied about the work 
in the cannery -- hand-peeling and coring the tomatoes, getting paid piecework 
by the pan, working as many hours as it took to finish that day's load of 
fruit -- was the highlight of the interview. Because people are more selective 
than machines, Teresa made much of how much better the canned fruit was in 
those days: "That's when everything was lovely. Now you don't know what you're 
getting." At the same time, she was proud to tell us that it was Joe Parelli 
who invented the peach-pitting machine . Cannery work was seasonal : spinach in 
the spring, apricots in July, peaches and pears in August. At the height of 
the season , F&P employed about 500 workers. 
It was Mimi who also told us about her mother drying tomatoes, peppers 
and zucchini, putting them in paper bags, tying the bags with string and 
hanging them in the basement for winter use. Teresa said her family used brine 
to preserve food. Between the food that was picked in the summer and the food 
that was put up for winter, there was never any need to shop. The food was so 
good in those days, Teresa said, that even with walking to school in wet 
weather, no one ever got colds. 
The talk of putting up fruits and vegetables leads to descriptions of 
what was eaten at Christmas and Easter: broccoli, pasta and bacalao was the 
remembered meal for Xmas eve. On Jan. 6, Epiphany , there was house -to-house 
singing of Italian songs with guitar and mandolin accompaniment for pastries. 
This tradition died out after WWII. Weddings were held in the fruit house --
the barn where the prunes were stored after they 'd been put through the 
dehydrator . The big wedding food was a stew made of lamb's entrails . 
Mimi's 
family lived in a fruit house, partitioned with fruit crates, while a new 
house was being built. 
These days, the women agreed, people don't visit 
anymore and families aren't as close as they were. 
With that the interview ended and we repaired to Teresa's ample side 
yard garden, where she picked figs and grapes for us . 
There was a chestnut 
tree in front, 
a cactus pear tree, fava beans, zukes, a persimmon tree, 
tomatoes, parsley, and probably more. From there, we piled into Mimi's car to 
look at Val Filice's Tank House Ristorante. We'll find out more about it from 
Val himself, presumably, but the women told us he regularly, almost daily, 
puts on feeds there. Outside, there's a sawed-in-half oil drum with steering-
wheel driven spit used for barbecues, plastic Italian and American flags and 
an engraved sign over the transom identifying the place as the Tank House 
Ristorante. 
The door to the tank house was unlocked, though the place is just on the 
edge of a subdivision that used to be a Filice prune orchard, and just down 
the street from the high school. Inside, paper bags of dried herbs hung from 
the rafters and a cupboard was opened to reveal shelf after shelf of jarred 
peaches, tomatoes and apricots . Back outside , Mimi cut open a melon and sliced

: 
a peach the women, which we ate while touring Val's garden . Mimi was going to 
have to remember to let Val know we were there lest he think his stores had 
been raided. The place is like a boy 's clubhouse , a place these self-made 
Italians escape to when they want to get back to the way they began, the 
Calabrian rusticity their daddies left behind. Or so I assume.

Outside the Viarengo house, at the back of a cul-de-sac, are a plow, a 
harrow and a wine press from his father's 17-acre farm in northwest Gilroy. 
Inside, along the hallway between the living room and the bedrooms, is a 
gallery of family portraits of their parents and grandparents. 
As is often the case, the wife, Aurora, defers to her husband, Aldo at 
interview time, though she has as much to contribute as he, as evidenced by 
the album of family photos and documents -- passports, poll tax receipts, 
social security cards, marriage licenses and newspaper clippings -- she put 
together and the family tree she's in the middle of tracing. 
His family story goes like this: father Giuseppe came from Piemonte in 
1906 at age 25, did ranch work as a hired hand, leased a agrden with a couple 
of partners and horse-and-buggied the produce to downtown San Jose, bounced 
around to Sacramento and San Joaquin counties before returning to Gilroy and 
buying his farm in 1927. In addition to grapes, which were sold to the 
wineries -- except for hat was retained for home use -- there was the usual 
assortment of prune and apricot trees, chicken and rabbit coops and vegetable 
garden. Prunes dominated the agriculture of the Santa Clara Valley in those 
days. In springtime, Aldo says, there were "white blossoms, the whole valley." 
Garlic didn't become the big thing until the 1950s. 
Aldo worked in the Filice and Perelli cannery unloading trucks and 
worked in their orchards picking peaches, pears and plums before the war and 
became a letter carrier after it, continuing to work the farm (dad died in 
'S1) until 1960. I wonder if these civil service sons -- Aldo the mailman and 
Al Gagliardi the sheriff's deputy --let their fathers down, walking away from 
the land like that. Gagliardi mentioned that his father was impressed by how 
much more money his son made than he did, but Gagliardi senior thought big, 
dreaming of acquiring vast tracts of land. I could see where these immigrants 
would be proud of their sons become professional men or capitalist banker-
realtor types. These are the kinds of opportunities that America was supposed 
to provide; Europe is full of civil service jobs. Well, security must have 
counted for something also. 
But as with Al Gagliardi, it was when Aldo took us into his backyard to 
show us his garden and his "junk," that I had the sense that this was who he 
really was, this putterer, grafting plum trees onto almond trees, tacking 
abalone shells to the back fence, making a garden gate out of Venetian blind 
slats and striping it in the red, white and green pattern of the Italian flag. 
"I guess I'll be a farmer all my life," he said. "Even though I moved to the 
city, I'm a farmer at heart." Back there was also where he kept his father's 
old bocce balls and wine spigots. 
We made off with the Aurora's album.

I thought it was a set of headphones, some piece of gear. It turned out to be 
a sack of grapes and figs Mimi Serafin had picked for us the day before.I felt 
like we already had plenty of grapes and figs, but trying to weasel out of 
coming back for the second bag proved difficult and finally, futile. It turned 
out to be a good thing we had a reason to return for Teresa had pulled out 
some family photos and even more valuable,-the peeling and coring tools she 
used when she worked at the Filice & Perelli cannery 60 or so years ago. She 
demonstrated each tool's use on a pear while I took pictures and coveted them 
for our exhibition. "There isn't that beauty of handwork anymore," Teresa said 
when she had done. "That's a lost art."

We went to Dave Porcella 's music store on Monterey St. at the suggestion 
of Aldo Viarengo . The first thing I noticed was a bass drum on a high shelf 
inscribed with the words, "Geo. Porcella's Pep Band/ The Gymkhana Town." The 
Gymkhana was some kind of rodeo and parade Gilroy used to have. George P. was 
Dave's father . The store was opened by grandpa Chas. Porcella , a Genovese, in 
1888. Then, it was a clothing store. Bandleader George made half of it a music 
store and Dave, also a musician , finished the conversion when he took it over, 
though he 's hung onto the 1940s and '50s clothing his father had, as well as a 
"George Porcella 's Merry Makers/ Gilroy" music stand, some band uniforms and a 
photo of the Merry Makers , another of his Uncle Frank's orchestra and another 
of the Pep Band. These bands played big band music , mainly, but they also knew 
Italian music and played at Italian weddings . And of course, there were 
tomatoes and beans growing in the store's backyards. 
There seem to be many more borrowables in Gilroy than there were in San 
Pedro and I think Paola hit on the reason : the Pedrans , as recent immigrants 
wouldn't have brought their old stuff with them and weren't established enough 
yet, geenration after generation , to venerate objects that the family had 
acquired since it arrived in America. 
We agreed to call Dave for a possible interview with him, his mother and 
his cousin in a few days.

When we arrive, Ernesto Fortino, in red, white and green "Sicilians are 
Sensational" apron (he's Calabrese; his wife's Sicilian), is showing one of 
his minions how to slice the garlic bread, son Gino is hand-trucking cases of 
half-price wine out to people's cars, daughter Teri is ringing up the 
purchases in the tasting room and wife Marie is overseeing the final 
preparations of the pasta al pesto, salad,.cold cuts and pizza in the kitchen. 
Just about everyone working there -- barbecuing, pouring wine, circulating 
antipasto platters -- all 15 or 20 of them, is a member of the extended 
family. Tables are set up in every room of the winery. The wine is flowing. In 
addition 
to getting tastes out of bottles, people can also turn the spigot on 
a cask of Petite Sirrah. 
Ernesto's barbecue is an impressive affair, circular, with about a 5-
foot diameter. A pan the same size as the grill is mounted on a trailer and 
filled with mesquite logs. A switch raises and lowers the grill. There are 165 
pounds of beef -- tri-tip steaks that Ernesto calls Santa Maria steaks -- and 
40 pounds of pasta. Pizza comes out of the kitchen and is scarfed up before it 
can make it out to the crush room. The crowd looks well enough heeled, but Ken 
says they're a good deal less hoity-toity than the people you'd find at a 
similar event in the Napa Valley. Both Gino and his brother-in-law are called 
upon to load 12 cases of assorted wine into the trunk of a Cadillac. 
I chat with Joe Fortino, Ernie's cousin (everyone calls him Ernie) and a 
Santa Clara County sheriff's deputy. He's aproned also and it is he who gives 
me the who's who on the family workforce. "The first generation comes and 
works like hell," he tells me. "The second generation develops it, and the 
third generation are bums." Ernesto, a second-generation man, is applauded as 
he enters a cask-lined room full of appreciative diners. 
We leave just as the dancing -- to a bluesy rock band -- is getting 
underway.

At 8 a.m., the Sicilian fishermen are straggling into the kitchen of San 
Carlos Cathedral in Monterey, grabbing coffee and a doughnut, putting on 
aprons and sharpening knives. The sinks are full of frozen calamari, 800 
pounds of it. The aprons say: Martini & Rossi Vermouth and Buon Apetito with 
Columbus (an Italian grocery store in San Francisco). Joe Russo wears his 
Bristol Bay Golf Tournament jacket: nowadays, most of the Monterey fleet does 
its fishing up in Bristol Bay, Alaska. They keep the boats there and fly up. 
The few boats remaining in Monterey Bay -- around 20, down from 100 post-world 
War II -- are squid fishmermen. The only cannery is up the coast a little ways 
in Sand City. There were 15 on Cannery Row. 
"You can keep talking," one of the calamari men tells the guy who is 
telling me all this, "but keep cutting." There are eight men in the kitchen, 
washing squid, cutting, mixing flour, salt, pepper, paprika and garlic powder 
and dredging milk-dipped squid in the flour mixture. The deep-frying is being 
handled by 
Tony DiGirolamo who ran (runs?) Angelo's Restaurant on the wharf. 
The first batch of calamari comes out of the fryer around 9 a.m. and is 
dumped on a plate for sampling.`The verdict: needs more salt. 
A jug of wine 
materializes. "All these guys are heart patients," Tony says as they have at 
the deep-fried food. "All had bypasses." To Paola, Tony says, a propos of 
what, I'm not sure, "We're Sicilians. When we drive the women sit in back. 
When we walk the women walk in back." "Know why they sit in back?" comes the 
rejoinder. "To tell the men which way to go." 
outside, procession preps accelerate. Garlanded angels adjust their 
cardboard wings. Santa Rosalia, the patron of Sicilian fishermen arrives on a 
trailer pulled by a Toyota pickup. According to an advance in the Monterey 
Peninsula Entertainment and Dining Review, "Santa Rosalia was a Sicilian 
noblewoman of German origin who renounced all of her wordly riches to become a 
recluse nun in the Sicilian mountains, where she went to meditate. She is 
credited with saving countless shipwrecked fishermen." Her likeness bears a 
skull and a book in her left hand and a coss in her right. She is surrounded 
by flowers and soon, the little girl angels. A boy is dressed in what I take 
to be traditional Sicilian garb: blue beret, red vest, white shirt, blue 
pants. The men are trying on their flagholders. The Knights of Columbus, most 
of whom are black and Filipino, with their feathered admiral caps, sashes and 
swords, assemble in the parking lot. The band rehearses in the church school. 
Video cameras roll. Still shots are snapped. 
The procession shapes up like this: At the head is a guy with a banner 
emblazoned with the image of the saint herself with her skull and book and the 
motto, "Ora Pro Nobis" -- Pray for , Us. He is flanked by guys bearing an 
American and Italian flag, respectively. In the second row, two more banners: 
one says Santa Rosalia Branch No. 36/Monterey/Established 1936; the other is a 
Sons of Italy carried by a couple of daughters of Itali in red-white-and-green 
skirts. Behind the banners is the band: two trombones, a sousaphone, two 
trumpets, a french horn, a clarinet, a snare and a bass drum. Behind the band, 
a trio of girls with bouquets. Behind the girls, a group of kids carrying a 
gold-painted string of fishing floats. The float is a circle with a tail at 
the front. Carrying the front end is a girl in a wedding dress and tiara, who 
carries a wooden crucifix in her other hand. Behind her, at the front of the 
ring, is the boy in Sicilian costume, who hold a triangular shield of fabric 
with the image of Jesus stitched into it. Three girls in white dresses carry 
the rest of the ring. Behind them are the Santa Rosalia Festival Queen 
candidates in satiny low-cut dresses. Behind them and alongside the float are 
the Knights of Columbus. The block-long 
procession, with a police car at the head and beginning with the band playing 
the Santa Rosalia theme by some standard John Philip Sousa marches and, 
astonishingly, the Muppets Show theme, begins on Figueroa St., turns left on 
Webster, then right on Monras, then right on Alvarado, festooned with red-
white-and-green bunting, under a banner proclaiming that the festival is 
sponsored by the Italian Heritage Society, and on down to Custom House Plaza 
and the wharf. The route itself is sparsely lined; most of the crowd is

waiting  at the plaza. 
The plaza is ringed by booths that will later sell cannoli, pepperoni 
pizza , pasta with sausage, drinks and of course, calamari. Another booth sells 
red-white -and-green T-shirts with mottoes such as, 
"You Can Bet Your Culo I'm 
Italian," FBI (Full-Blooded Italian) and "Italian Love / 24 Hour Service/ Pasta 
and Wine Included ; and buttons with such mottoes as, "Cucuzza Power," and, 
"The Luckiest (Happiest?) People Marry Italians ." Many people are decked out 
in such regalia , along with white cowboy hats with red-white-and-green 
hatbands , red-white-and-green golf caps and Lodi Italian Club or Antioch Bocce 
Federation satin jackets. 
At the plaza eight fishermen lift Santa Rosalia out of her litter and 
bear her down to the wharf, where the roll of fishermen lost at sea is called 
-- the crowd intones, "Lord have mercy after each" -- and the Monsignor 
blesses the fleet. The procession then returns to the plaza , for the raising 
of the American and Italian flags and the singing of the two countries' 
national anthems, followed by the saying of Mass and speeches by the mayor of 
Monetery and Congressman Leo Panetta , among others . Then the bocce tournament 
begins, the food booths begin dispensing and the entertainment starts. We run 
into Ernesto Fortino, who introduces us to "Monterey legend" Charlie 
DellaSalla, who tells us we ought to talk to Bank of America veep Jerome 
Lucido, who 's written a little book about the Italians of Monterey. As we 
leave we see a costumed Sicilian folk dance troupe warming up for its segment 
of the day's program.

The view from above is reassuring . The developed 
portions of south Santa Clara Valley are dwarfed by the sprawl of orchards, 
greenhouses, vineyards , tree nurseries , tomato and garlic fields , and golden 
rectangles of marigolds . Doubtless the oldtimers would take a different view 
of the same sights . From the air I see Ernesto Fortino at his winery, the 
Garlic Shoppe, Garlic World and Rapazzini Winery along highway 101 , pickers 
and tomato trucks in the tomato fields, backyards that butt up against 
orchards, "ranchettes ," swimming pools and the painted outlines of schoolyard 
basketball and hopscotch courts. The garlic smell wafts up from the processing

Spoke by phone with Andy D'Arrigo in Salinas, of the 
D'Arrigo Brothers cactus pear farm on the Hecker Pass Highway. We beame 
interested in the farm when we found out from Teresa Filice and Mimi Serafin 
that cactus pears are Sicilian in origin. D'Arrigo is your proverbial "busy 
man": off to the east coast tomorrow and to Africa at the end of the month. It 
doesn't sound like I'll get to see him; he says he'll send me a brochure. 
What's interesting about the D'Arrigos, though, is that they mainly grow 
Italian specialty produce like cactus pears, rappini (mustard greens), sweet 
anise and broccoli, which started out as a specialty item before it went 
mainstream. Cactus pears are going in the opposite direction. Fewer people 
know what they are (the Italian name is Fig of India), D'Arrigo said, and this 
is the last year for growing them in Gilroy. Next year the operation will 
shift to Monterey County. If nothing else, photos of the cactus pears would be 
a good idea.

The Bertolones live in a non-descript suburban house 
on the southwest side of Gilroy. Nothing about the place tells you anything 
about the people who live there, except perhaps, for the cars: there's a 
sporty Toyota in the driveway and two Mercedes (one under wraps) in the 
garage 
Joe, the dad, answers the door and Sonia, teenaged, owner of the wrapped 
Mercedes (her 16th birthday present) is right behind him. We bee-line for the 
kitchen, where Elvira, the mom, is cooking, and a woman named Mona who works 
in the family restaurant is sitting on a barstool. Glenn Close, John Malkovich 
and Michelle Pfeiffer cavort loudly in the background. Sonia is so fond of 
"Dangerous Liaisons " that she bought the videocassette and has a poster of the 
stars in her bedroom. 
After greeting the family, we get the tour. Joe takes us to a closed, 
probably never-used little showcase room done up in a florid Palace of 
Versailles style with about two dozen dolls goggling at us from the floor. No 
sooner do we sit down and tell Joe of our preference for wine over Scotch when 
Sonia asks if we'd like to see the rest of the house, so we recross the front 
hall to the dining room, also, by the looks of things, never used. On the 
dining room table are some plans for a condo complex Joe is building in Los 
Banos, on the other side of Pacheco Pass in the San Joaquin Valley. The other 
dining room door leads us back to the kitchen, whence we snake back through 
the front hall, past the map of Sicily opposite the front door and on down the 
family photo-lined hall that leads to the bedrooms. We peer in at the bathroom 
and the little sister's pink and stuffed-animal stuffed room, enter 16-year-
old Anthony's room to check out his pin-up, car and rockstar posters, are 
shown the linens from Sicily in the closet of the master bedroom and spend a 
little time among the rock star posters, new word processor and battery-
powered crybaby dolls and in the company of Irvington the cat. 
Then it's back to the kitchen again and out the door to the laundry room 
and into the garage. A picture of Jesus and his sacred heart hangs on the wall 
between the two Mercedes. A side door leads to a side yard and on into the 
backyard, bereft of vegetable garden, but containing a fig, an olive and a few 
other fruit trees. From the backyard we re-enter the house via a backdoor 
leading into the knickknacky den where Glenn, John and Michelle are still at 
it and stand around while wine and antipasto are readied. We sit down at the 
everyday, informal dining room table with Joe to a basket of bread, a plate of 
cold cuts and cheese, a bowl of parmesan chunks, a bowl of olives and the 
first of several bottles of wine. The two rooms seem to overflow with noise, 
people and objects. 
We chat about the restaurant business, Sonia fetches an article about 
her "Mama" that ran in the Gilroy Dispatch, the kids and kids' friends return 
from wherever they've been, we get up from the table to slip in its leaves and 
spread a couple of red table cloths, sit back down and Sonia and Elvira serve 
two huge bowls of shells with tomato sauce, a platter of sliced potatoes 
sauted with onions and peppers, salad, a mountain of bread and grated 
parmesan. During the meal, Sonia is dispatched to the restaurant a couple of 
blocks away to fetch some eggplant meatballs. The highlights of the 
conversation were Joe's story of his visit to an Italian restaurant near 
Disneyland that among other failings, committed the appalling crime of serving 
cappuccino in wine glasses; his vehement denunciations of Mexican food; his 
expostulations on his money is power, power is money view of the world; his 
account of the years he spent working in a restaurant in England before coming 
to the U.S.; stories that get told in English to us and Italian to Paola; 
Joe's deliberate hand gestures -- whenever he uses the word "but," he he 
brings his right hand up in a half circle and pops his index finger up at the 
top of the circle's arc -- and their contrast with his wife's more vehement 
ones -- which include the thrice-shaken fist and the thrusting index finger 
and pinky when she talked about people she didn't like; and toasts to wine, 
women and garlic. We close out the meal with flan, vanilla ice cream with 
syrupy cherries, espresso retrieved from the restaurant, and shots of grappa.

Given the elaborateness of the meal itself, I was surprised by the 
informal way in which it was eaten . Sonia wore slippers, Elvira wore a T-
shirt, the kids sat down to eat after the meal had begun and got up to leave 
before it was finished , an Italian movie continued to blare from the den after 
"Dangerous Liaisons ," salty language was used. This is what they do every

Mario Fortino has the same smiling eyes as his brother Ernesto, but his 
Hecker Pass Winery is quite a different operation: no deli, no "European 
boutique," no gift items, T-shirts, hats, etc. Just a tasting room. More in 
the European style, according to Mario. He and his wife live in a mobile home 
at the edge of the vineyard. 
On a Tuesday afternoon, after Labor Day, the place is quiet. Mario 
himself is in charge of the tasting room, the most charming features of which 
are its bottle cork archways. The only other soul on the place is his 5-year-
old grandson Michael, who busies himself with nuts and bolts. 
We do the interview in the office. Mario tells us the same story Ernest 
did: how his father was born in Pittsburg, Kansas in 1905, how he went back to 
Italy to fight for his country, losing his American citizenship in the 
process, how he returned to America in 1959 with his family. 
Mario was 21. He worked 15 years in local wineries -- San Martin, 
mostly, Almaden also -- driving forklifts, running a vinegar plant, shipping 
and receiving, before buying his own in 1970. He's got 15 acres of grapes. For 
the first three years he concentrated on growing the grapes. In 1973, he 
bought two 950-gallon redwood fermenting tanks and 50 oak barrels and did his 
first crush. In 1974 he picked up his first gold medal at the L.A. County 
Fair. 
Amazingly, nobody works for him. Even his three sons are part-timers, 
making their livings as a plumber, a mechanic and a salesman. The crush, a 
week away, is done entirely by family and friends. That "family feeling," he 
tells us, "goes into the product." Staying small enables him to produce 
natural wines that undergo no clarification or filtration. "The old tradition 
is the best," he says. "Everything should be natural as Mother Nature created 
it." 
The best stuff on the tapes, it seems to me, is Mario's detailed rundown 
on how the grapes are picked (by hand) and crushed. The best way is to pick in 
the day and crush during the night. At the end of it all -- Paola refers to 
the process as the vendemia in Italian -- he and his wife prepare a big meal 
for all those who helped. 
This is not the end of the winemaker's labors, but it is the end of the 
period of worry about the'weather messing things up. After three weeks in the 
fermentation tanks, the sediment is removed. Then comes the holiday rush, a 
busy time in the tasting room, followed by pruning, a more labor-inytensive 
job than picking, but one that can be done at a more leisurely pace. Anytime 
between the end of November and the end of February will do. In April, 
sediment is again removed from the tanks and excess growth is pinched from the 
vines. By June, Mario says, anything you do to the vines is likelier to hurt 
them than help them. Again and again he mentions coming from three generations 
of winemakers, a tradition that enables him to prune and graft "without even 
thinking about it." 
He takes us through his barrels rooms, and back in the tasting room he 
offers us a bottle of Carignane, a wine that is good with pasta, he tells us, 
and "the Mexicans say it's good with enchiladas, too."

Grape picking time at the Guglielmo Winery in Morgan 
Hill. Gene G., one of three G.G . brothers who've inherited operation of the 
winery from their grandfather Emile and their father George, greets us and 
turns us loose in the vineyards, where about 15 Mexican pickers are trying to 
make 60 cents -a-bucket pay by doing the work at a run, dumping two buckets at 
a time into blue , cube-shaped E. Guglielmo bins at the ends of the rows. They 
carry punch cards in their back pockets or.in their caps -- "I Love to Party 
Hardy," "Drive-in Liquors ," "Nike Air," "Bay Meadows." A woman runs up and 
down along the row-ends , punching cards. 
One small and very fast fellow, Manuel, the fastest of the pickers, Gene 
later tells us, has a stylish way of hefting his buckets up and over the edge 
of the bin , dropping them into the bin and freeing his hands to catch his cap, 
which a sharp downward shake of his head drops inside up into his hands, 
enabling the woman to pick out his punch card and punch it. The picking 
started at 7 a.m. Manuel tells me as he works, and will probably go until 
4:30. He figures to pick 100 to 140 buckets , giving him a day's wages of $60 
to $84. This is the fourth day of a two -week harvest . "He's a good boss," he 
says when I ask him how he likes working for the Guglielmos, "very good." 
Manuel and the other pickers use small, scimitar-shaped knives with 
orange plastic handles to cut the grapes away from the vines. In their haste 
to get at the grapes they shove the vines out of the way . The sounds are the 
rustle of the vine leaves , the buzz of yellow jackets , the clonk of empty 
buckets as the pickers run down the rows, feet and buckets scrunching the 
earth . One guy is whistling through his teeth . Standing in the vineyard, you 
can only see three or four of the pickers at a time, but a shiver of leaves 
lets you know where the rest of them are. It may be harvest time, but the 
weather is summer. At 10 a.m. the sun is blazing away and the air is still. 
Gene Guglielmo bicycles out to the vineyard to see how we're doing. He's 
wearing a wine-colored Emilio Guglielmo Winery emblazoned shirt, a G-
monogrammed belt buckle , cowboy boots and jeans. The low-down is that there 
are 85 acres of grapes at the winery, 15 elsewhere, and that the grapes being 
picked thgis day are zinfandel and carignane. These are the old "head-type" 
vines, as distinct from the newer trellis types. 
The winery itself consists of tasting room, tank house (now a guest 
house with summer kitchen ), 
office (where the family used to live -- there's 
still about 20,000 gallons of eine in the basement and one prosciutto hanging 
from the rafters), and the sprawling building where the wine is aged, bottled 
and stored. The buildings are all stuccoed , with tile roofs. The verandah of 
the tasting room is decorated with wine barrels full of flowers , an old hand-
cranked press and wrought iron rails with a grape motif over the windows. On 
the back of the processing plant a backboard and basket are mounted among the 
ivy 
The oldest brother, George , the winemaker (learned his enology at Fresno 
State ), wearing red suspenders , stogie clenched between his teeth, is waiting 
for us at the crusher. In describing the winemaking process he speaks of 
"marrying the tannin in the wine with the tannin in the wood." 
The process goes something like this: you back the 1945 stakebed truck 
up to the crusher to receive the seeds and stems it spits out , forklift the 
blue bins that have just been driven over from the vineyard into a loader and 
then you -- that is, George -- flip a switch that tips the contents of the
,bin 
into the crusher . 
At the bottom of the crusher a screw drives the grapes 
toward an opening at the back, forcing the grapes onto a mesh-lined belt along 
which a second screw drives the grapes up and into a drum that separates the 
stems from the juice, which gets piped overhead into one of 10 stainless steel 
tanks, where the juice will sit for three to five days before being pumped 
into the press to extract juice and color from the skins . During this process, 
Gene , marketing and sales, climbs into the back of the stakebed to distribute 
the stem pile with a pitchfork. 
When we've seen enough crushing we repair to the tasting room, whose 
highlights include bottles of "Deficit Red" (graph- style label with jagged 
red line plunging from left to right ), a variety of Italian groceries 
a:-Ab_) -
 •V - Poi 13Fq ,,4, ---
I- 
(including Brioschi , for upset stomachs), family photos and a sort of 
statement of purpose that conveys the family's strong sense of carrying on old 
Emilio's wine -making tradition. 
Adjacent to the tasting room is a garage with a plaque listing the 25 
members of the FBI Club , whose creed goes like this: "We, the proud and noble 
fratelli of Italian descent gather to celebrate and perpetuate our Italian 
heritage through the consumption of fine Italian cuisine accompanied with the 
traditional wine. We strive to strengthen our common bond of brotherhood as 
full -blooded Italians." This is recited , tous ensemble , at the end of every 
meeting . The group was founded , Gene says to "keep the Italian feeling going. 
We don't really have much to discuss, we just yell at each other." 
Gene invites us to lunch with his brothers . He pulls a few jars of 
antipasto, sun-dried tomatoes in olive oil and anchovies off the shelves in 
the tasting room and takes us into the tank house kitchen, where he and George 
lay out a spread that also includes salami, bread, two cheeses, a lettuce 
salad, and two bottles of wine. Do you eat like this every day, I ask George. 
"Yesterday we had Chinese ," he says . I ask them about good Italian restaurants 
in Morgan Hill . He says, "When $you grew up in an Italian family you don't go 
to an Italian restaurant ." the third brother, Gary , also in marketing and 
sales , joins us. He 's 33, Gene is 40 and George, 42. Their dad is George 
Washington Guglielmo , born Feb. 22. 
On the wall behind the TV where we get the noon news hangs a red-white-
and-green poster with the words , "Everyone should trying being Italian at 
least once a year." This feels like the day.

Ed Pedrizetti, a white-haired, ruddy-faced man in a 
battered straw hat, plaid western shirt, boots and jeans, and three workers 
are feeding bottles of Gewurtztraminer through a labeler for shipment to 
Canada. The process consists of popping heat-shrink caps over the bottle and 
placing them on a belt that conveys them through the heat shrinker, to the 
gluer, the labeler and the label-presser before they are put in cases. 
He takes us on a quick tour of his stainless steel, double-jacketed tank 
room and outside to his crusher, explaining that he quit growing garpes in 
1975 and now buys them all from Monterey and San Luis Obispo counties, that 
his family's had the business since 1945 and that he makes 75,000 cases of 
wine per year. 
During the interview in the office (a wall plaque cites 1-Timothy 5:23: 
"A little wine for thy stomach's sake and thy infirmities"), Ed and his wife 
Phyllis outlined the Pedrizetti family story thus: Ed's grandfather, a 
Piemontese, came over in 1906. His father came two years later at age 9 with 
his mother and sister. His mother, who's family was from Lombardy, was born in 
Albany, California. 
Ed's dad, John, 90, living just across the road from the winery (Ed and 
Phyllis's house is right on the winery site), worked at the San Martin Winery 
and grew the usual prunes, grapes, tomatoes and walnuts before buying the 
Colombano winery in 1945. Ed took it over in 1968. Now he and Phyllis, "burnt 
out," their kids off doing other things, are looking to get out. "Now it's all 
a big rush," Phyllis says. "If we could do it the old Italian way..." By the 
old Italian way she means the play that went hand in hand with the work: the 
once-a-month parties where accordion was played and Italian songs were sung 
and gallon jugs of wine were on the table. "These people aren't around 
anymore," Phyllis says. "When they died out, the entire lifestyle died out 
with them. If it had stayed the good old family Italian style, then it was 
fun. But you just can't make a living that way anymore." 
The place has been quiet since we arrived, only four people working 
beside the Pedrizettis themselves, but during the interview things start to 
hop. Somebody wants a load of champagne; unscheduled, a tour bus full of 
Quebecois arrives. Fortunately for us, we're about done when all this happens 
and repair to the patio area behind the winery to watch Phyllis conduct the 
tasting while Ed stands by. 
The original brick building that fronts the road, built in 1913 is an 
architectural highlight.

Mario Fiorio's farm appears to be in a precarious 
position, surrounded on two sides by subdivisions and on a third by Monterey 
St. This interview takes place in the evening, around the dining room table, 
with Mario, his wife Ines and his mother, Maria. Son Richard pokes his head in 
a couple of times. 
The Fiorios are Piemontesi. Maria came over with her husband at age 19 
in 1928, Mario was born in San Francisco the following year and the family 
moved to Gilroy in 1933. They rented a ranch and grew prunes and apricots, 
selling to dried fruit packers. They bought the place where the family still 
lives in 1943. It was:all prunes then. It's all seed crops now: flowers, 
beans, cauliflower, peppers and melons which are grown only to be ripped apart 
to get at the seeds, which are packaged and sold to backyard gardeners. 
In those days, says Maria, "the Italian community stuck together. I 
didn't know I was in this country. It was like I was in Italy yet." There were 
picnics, dinners so big that the next day everyone would come back to eat the 
leftovers. The Calabresi and the Piemontesi, according to Maria, "didn't mix." 
Mario adds that the Calabresi "stick to the old ways more." 
Maria worked in the cannery for four years. Her husband lasted a half 
day. They put him to work stomping dry hot peppers, which so burned his skin 
that he left at mid-day and never returned. He died in 1967. 
Ines serves coffee and chocolate cake. We arrange for me to return next 
afternoon with Ken to take pictures of Mario at work in the fields.

John Roffinella's ranch, adjacent to the Fortino 
Winery on Watsonville Rd., is probably the best example of what an old Italian 
ranch in Santa Clara County looks like. HIs father, from Asti, worked in a 
winery when he came to Gilroy and bought the place in 1923. I don't think it's 
changed much. Recalling those days, Roffinella, who's 80, remembers two-day 
parties (people came back the second day to finish leftovers from the first 
day) and the Calabresi living on the east side of town while the northerners 
lived on the west side. It was Roffinella who started the Gilroy chapter of 
the Italian Catholic Federation. The meetings, conducted in Italian, were in 
fact dinners, the memebrs taking turns preparing foods from their home 
regions. Thinking of those days, Roffinella sounds the familiar old-timer's 
theme: "People don't visit as much as they used to. Now you don't even know 
who your neighbors are." 
Like just about everybody else, Roffinella put in his two years in the 
cannery. Maria Fiorio mentioned a bus coming around and picking up the cannery 
workers. Roffinella was one of the ones who drove the bus. He also ranched for 
someone else before he came back to work on his own place. The interesting 
thing about Roffinella's business is that he sold and delivered and crushed, 
on-site, grapes to home winemakers. Now he leases his 20-acre vineyard to 
Ernesto Fortino, but still makes his own wine in the garage and has an 
impressive wine cellar under his house. 
He and his father dug the basement 
out with two horses, a Fresno scraper, a pick and a shovel. They used to hold 
dances down there. 
Back out in the light of day, Roffinella takes me on a tour of the 
"barbecue room," where herbs hang from the rafters in paper bags, a couple of 
pines brought back by his mother from the Vatican Gardens, the "museum," 
cluttered with old cash registers and lamps, an outdoor museum of old 
tractors, the building that was used for loading grapes onto the delivery 
truck, the adjoining guest house, whose walls are made from fruit crate shooks 
and his large and lovely garden. Like so many of the folks we've interviewed 
in Gilroy, Roffinella only really became animated when he was showing me 
around the gardens. With a knife he cut a switch of Italian basket willow and 
showed me how his father used it to bind vines. "With that one willow my 
father would tie all this vineyard," he said. "Cheap rope."

We arrive at the Fiorio 's house at 1 p.m. just as the 
family is finishing lunch. We're offered and accept slices of watermelon 
before we jump into Mario's pickup, moving the canteloupes of the front seat 
and onto the floor, and lightout for the marigold fields. A giant vacuum 
cleanerr is sucking up the seeds. Sons Rich , 25, and Danny , 27, join us. Mario 
calls them "the best two young farmers in Gilroy ." Ken takes a splendid 
portrait of the two sons crouching among the marigolds with Mario standing 
between them , a hand on each one's shoulder and the vacuum coming up behind. 
On the way from the marigold field to check the drip irrigation system 
on the already-harvested cucumber patch, I ask Mario if he has a backyard 
garden. "I have absolutely no patience for a garden ," he says. His sons, ag-
school grads both, had to talk him into investing in the drip irrigation 
system. "A lot of their ideas," he concedes, "are pretty doggone good. Of 
course, I never tell them that because then you don't hear the end of it." 
From the cuke field we drive east across the freeway to 
check the bell 
peppers and the canteloupes. Mario cuts into a few melons to find out what a 
ripe one feels like so he can give us a few to take back . The roads , we notice 
are strewn with smashed tomatoes, especially the curves.

Paola interviews with Carolyn Tognetti and her mother, 
Gloria Rizzi , at Garlic World, while I go across the road with Ken to watch 
the tomato pickers work for Ed Tognetti . A tractor pulling a pair of trailers 
-- 25 tons capacity -- moves down the row in tandem with a bus-sized monster 
of a picker which carries two sorters along with the driver . Next time I look 
up from note -writing I see that Ken has climbed aboard; next time the picker 
passes near me I jump on also. We're traveling over what looks like a field of 
red Christmas balls, the picker slurping up the vines , mechanically separating 
leaves, stems and clods of dirt 
from fruit and electronically separating 
green toms from red ones . The picker rocks back and forth over the field like 
an old ferryboat , but here's what it can do: 20 acres a day, making this a 
two-day harvest. 
Ed Tognetti pulls up in his pickup and tells me he also grows garlic, 
peppers, corn , beans and flowers on a total of about 900 acres, almost all of 
it leased . While we're chatting , guys from both Gi1Can and Tri-Valley Cannery 
show up to see how things are going. Ed, eating sunflower seeds, watches the 
picking. A few minutes later, his son Gary, a high school junior, stops by. 
Ed drives us back to Garlic World , where Paola is finishing up with the 
women. Ken shoots some pix of Carolyn out in the store, and they send us off 
with bags of fruit, jars of olives and braids of garlic.

Out and about with Ken dropping off borrowed photos 
and albums, shooting things like the "Welcome to Gilroy, Garlic Capitol of the 
World" sign, a Nob Hill Foods truck trailer, the Green Garden tomato cannery 
(idle, whether because it's Saturday or because it's raining and no new toms 
are coming in, I don't know). 
The meatiest stop on this tour up and down Monterey St. is back at 
Porcella's Music Store, where Ken shoots George Porcella's Pep Band drum and 
another with a scene of what appears to be a ship of Columbus's fleet from 
another of George's bands, The Merrymakers. 
Out back, Ken shoots a bandstand and a band uniform that Dave fishes out 
from a practice room in the back store and an upstairs storgae space that 
still contains the 40s clothing that his grandfather sold before George and 
then Dave converted clothing store to music store. 
Also of interest is a display case full of photos of George's and his 
brother Frank's various bands, and several autographed photos of Duke 
Ellington, Ivie Anderson and the Ellington Orchestra. Ivie Anderson lived 
across the stret from the Porcellas in Gilroy. 
Ken also gets exteriors of the building front, with its "Porcella's 
Since 1907" sign, a stained-glass window made by Dave Porcella (the shop's 
third generation owner) and incorporating a couple of rampant boars (porcelli) 
into the design, and, best of all, a couple of corn and tomato plants Dave put 
in in the little square of dirt surrounding the two street trees that flank 
the store. "A little Italian culture," Dave says.

On a day of low clouds, rain and dire newspaper 
predictions on the effects on the grape harvest, Ken and I drop by LJB Farms 
north of Gilroy . Behind the counter of the Bonino family fruit "stand" -- it's 
a barn, really -- we find Judy, ringing up customers, and son Russell, bagging 
raisins . Another son , whose name I'll get tomorrow, is culling green unripe 
apples from a bin of red ones. 
The Boninos have gone backward to go-forward. They were growing pears 
for the cannery when their sons , ages 4 and 6, asked to sell fruit in front of 
the house . They quickly sold out. Then they were test-growing some corn for a 
seed company and quickly sold off the ears that didn't go to the lab for 
testing. Before long, they were out of the business of growing fruits and 
vegetables for seed or canning and were growing entirely to sell what they 
grow to the public. 
In contrast to the antiseptic, big-retail look of Garlic World, LJB has 
the cozy look of a barn. The walls are covered with garlic braids. By mid-day, 
cars are streaming in. Judy directs us to husband Lou's Aunt Jennie in Morgan 
Hill and we arrange to interview Lou and take pictures of the work in the 
fields tomorrow morning . LJB is'a find: an everyone-pitches-in family business 
that has been in the family since 1917. 
TIAW-RF-F091789.B= 
The Boninos are yet another northern Italian family 
from near Torino, where, says Jennie Costa (she married a Portygee), "they 
made a living with their cow and their little piece of land. Her dad came to 
the states in 1905. "At the that time the story was money grew on trees." He 
intended to pluck some and return to Italy, but he wound up in the coal mines 
of Bingham, Utah, and after a year he sent for his wife. 
In 1911, the Boninos came to California, where Jennie's dad (didn't get 
his first name) worked in a Redwood City salt plant. What he wanted to do, 
though, was buy a ranch, which he did in San Martin in 1918. He raised grapes 
and prunes and like Jbhn Roffinella, he delivered grapes to Bay Area Italian 
families for home wine-making. Jennie and her husband stayed in the prune and 
grape business in Morgan Hill until they retired. Her brother Tony switched to 
row crops. Tony is Lou's dad. Lou is the "L" in LJB(onino). 
The Costas sold off their orchards, but have hung onto their tidy little 
"homestead" -- ranch house and outbuildings -- at the end of a long tree-lined 
drive. I don't see anything in the way of "Italian" decor around the house and 
in fact, Jennie tells me that after she married, she "changed over to the 
American way of doing things. Ilignored the Italian traditions." Those 
traditions included: baking'bread in outdoor forno, making pasta, singing, 
working together as a family, and partying after the prune harvest. Her son, 
who sat in on the interview with his wife, works at Hewlett-Packard, lives in 
Cupertino and speaks no Italian. 
I should mention that when she was in high school, Jennie Bonino worked 
summers in the Filice-Perelli cannery, going back to school just as the tomato 
harvest would start coming in.

A third day of rain and no picking at LJB Farms. Lou 
Bonino, 48, and the third Bonino to farm in San Martin leads us from the 
produce store, through the backyard past the swimming pool he's too busy to 
use and his spit barbecue, and into the living room, where we do the 
interview. 
The family story he tells is sketchier than the one told by his Aunt 
Jennie Costas, but the basic facts again are: his Turinese grandfather mined 
coal in Illinois and copper in Bingham Canyon (a 1914 calendar from the 
Bingham mine hangs in the game room), and worked in a tannery in Redwood City 
before buying a piece'of land in San Martin and planting grapes for delivery 
to home winemakers during Prohibition, and prunes. 
His by-now standard description of Italian life covers neighbors helping 
each other with the pruning, Sunday visiting, Friday night dancing (Lou's 
parents met at such a dance), sausage and salami-making (Lou still makes 
sausage and vinegar; he no longer makes wine; his mom still cans), bread-
baking in an outdoor oven (his wife's 97-year-old aunt in Gustine still does 
this), fruit canning, mushroom-picking (they would put a silver dollar in with 
the mushrooms and if it turned black they knew the mushrooms were no good to 
eat). At his maternal grandparents' house -- they were Swiss-Italian dairy 
farmers, last name Sgheiza -- they made cheese and butter and kept rabbits. 
His grandfather's milking stool hangs on the living room wall. "Tough people," 
he says of the previous generations. "They weren't afraid to work." 
Turning to his own career, Lou says that he swore when he went to 
college that he'd never be a farmer, but when he came back from the service 
that's what he set out to do, gradually converting the family farm from a 
vineyard and orchard operation to a row crop operation. At first, he grew for 
the seed companies and the canners, but when his little sons did well selling 
the leftovers from a stand in front of the house the business began to take 
its current shape. Lou also worked at his wife's family's business, Carriage 
House in Watsonville, producing jams and jellies and peanut butter and he's 
now scheming to open a plant of his own that would produce fruit concentrates 
for juices and such. Meanwhile, a subdivision is coming acros the road. Lou 
says he promised he'd move when the first house goes up. Now he figures, "I'll 
probably die here." There are worse places to die. 
The most compelling 
parts of this interview covered the sausage and vinegar making, and an 
articulation of the never-borrow-money ethic preached and practiced by all 
three generations of the Bonino clan. When I asked him about weather lore, he 
said underground crops were planted by the dark of the moon and above 
grounders by the light of the moon. Blackbirds signal a weather change: "When 
they bunch up, winter's coming." They're bunching up now. 
Bonino may have been the most relaxed of all the folks I've interviewed. 
The stream of talk flowed nicely along. When it ended, after two hours, Lou 
showed us the family portrait gallery behind the bar in the living room and 
agreed to let us make copies of them. 
The rain having let up, we went out to the fields with him, Joe Carbajal 
and Luis Sanchez to pick corn. Doug and I followed the two pickers down the 
corn rows. When we emerged, our shoes trailed corn leaves and were heavy with 
mud. We took pictures of Lou in lovely fields of Hungarian hot wax peppers, 
cherry bells, and pacillas. 
As part of the tour of the family holdings, Lou also showed us a tomato 
field adjacent to a driving range (the road was strewn with golf balls) and a 
series of trial fields he leases to Northrup King (the seed people) on land 
that belonged to his maternal grandparents. The horse and cow barns still 
stand. "They never used to waste anything," he said of his granparents and of 
the oldtimers generally. "They used everything. Nothing went to waste." On 
tape, earlier, he said the only part of a pig they didn't use was the squeal. 
Our tour and visit with Lou winds up in Denny's for lunch, the Gilroy 
farmers' morning gathering place. Lou wants us to come back to the house to 
interview his father, but our time grows short.

Thomas Kruse, a Hecker Pass Highway winemaker, is 
enlisted to make lunch, another scampi-like shrimp and pasta dish he calls 
"Pasta Capri." We figure to eat, then repair to George Jr.s' office for a 
formal interview, but set up the tape recorder in the summer kitchen in the 
remodeled tank house anyway, and never make it over to George's office. 
Present are the three GG boys -- George, Gene and Gary, their parents George 
and Madeline, Tom Kruse, Paola and me. What the tape lacks in chronological 
order and coherence, it gains in "conversationality," though sensing that the 
interview in George's'affice will never take place, I begin to steer the 
conversation mroe and more as we go along, asking George Sr. and the boys 
about old Emilio, what sort of guy he was, his bootlegging days, how he ran 
the business. With a plate of food and a glass of wine in front of me I took 
no notes, and can only comment on what a convivial and leisurely afternoon it 
was. After the meal I took some family photos with the vineyards in the 
background, Gene loaded me up with a bag of red bell peppers and a gift box of 
wine and imprinted glasses, we bought a few items in the tasting room and 
finally took our leave at around five o'clock -- five hours after we arrived.
