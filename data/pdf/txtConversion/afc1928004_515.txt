Good-Tempered Man. 
Written and sung with tremendous success by the great and only 
HARRY RICHMOND, the refined comic vocalist. 
What a 
pity to hear some people declare 
That life is a 
burden of sorrow and care; 
I've lived forty years in this valley of tears, 
And of troubles I've had a 
full share, 
And I 
find it is wiser to laugh than to cry, 
And merrily sing if you can ; 
Clouds that are dark may clear by-and-by, 
So laugh like a 
good-tempered man, 
Ha! ha! ha! 
was always a 
good-tempered man. 
My courting I 
paid to a 
fair pretty maid, 
When I 
asked her to wed she lovingly said, 
" 
Dear Daniel it's true I'm faithful to you, 
Believe me and don't be afraid." 
But in less than a 
month her promise she broke, 
And off with another she ran ; 
T 
laughed and treated it all as a 
joke, 
For I'm such a 
good-tempered man. 
Ha! ha! ha! 
Oh, I'm such a 
good-tempered man. 
A mob in the street I 
happened to meet, 
A 
thief with a 
snatch ran away with my watch, 
My hat with surprise was knock'd over my eyes, 
Crying " Stop thief," the people all ran, 
But I 
never moved an inch from the spot, 
But to laugh and to dance I 
began, 
To think what a 
guy at that moment I 
look'd, 
Oh I'm such a 
good-tempered man. 
Ha! ha! ha 
Oh ! I'm such a 
good-tempered man. 
Then never give way to that demon dismay, 
If to- day you are down and acquaintances frown, 
To-morrow may bring quite a 
different thing, 
And life's but a 
flash in the pan. 
If care, as they tell us, once killed a 
poor cat, 
Though scarcely believe them I 
can, 
Like me you are bound to get jolly and fat, 
If you laugh like a 
good-tempered man.. 
Ha ! ha! ha ! 
I 
was always a 
good-tempered man,

Wicklow's Green Hill. 
Written and sung with unbounded applause by HARRY RICHMOND, 
author of " Old Ireland Must be Free." " We Might as Well be 
Jolly" " The Way to be Happy," " The Laboring Man," &c &c 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 1880. 
There's a 
place o'er the sea 
Where my boyhood was spent, 
With the friend of my youth, 
I, indeed was content. 
I 
have roamed through the world, 
But my heart's beating still, 
Fm the friends of my boyhood 
On Wicklow's Green Hill. 
CHORUS. 
On Wicklow's Green Hill 
My heart's beating still, 
For the friends of my boyhood, 
On Wicklow's Green Hill. 
I 
crossed the wide ocean 
To this glorious land, 
And found here a 
welcome 
With friendship's warm hand, 
Extended to me with honest good will, 
So much like my own friends 
On Wicklow's Green Hill. 
On Wicklow's Green Hill, &c. 
But my father and mother, 
Are both growing old, 
My presence would cheer them, 
By their letters I'm told. 
I'll hasten away my duty to fill, 
To my kind loving parents 
On Wicklow's Green Hill. 
On Wicklow's Green Hill, &c. 
Then farewell Columbia, 
To thy ever free shore, 
I 
leave thee my blessing 
Should I 
ne'er see thee more; 
I'll sing in thy praise, 
And respect thee until, 
I 
sleep my last sleep 
On Wicklow's Green Hill. 
On Wicklow's Green Hill, 8,:c.

I'll Ask My Mother. 
Written and sung by HARRY RICHMOND,. the refined comic vocalist, 
with great applause. 
A 
pretty litttle girl came courting me, her name was Sarah 
Broome, 
She wanted me to marry her, and thought I 
was a 
loon, 
She said " I 
was a 
nice young man, and we might be well off 
soon,' 
But I'll ask my mother, and I'll let you know next Sunday 
afternoon. 
CHORUS. 
The kindness of this pretty little girl I 
never can forget, 
That wanted me to marry her, but I 
cannot see that yet. 
One afternoon Miss Sarah Broome took me out for a 
walk, 
She kiss'd me and caress'd me, and so lovingly did talk. 
She wanted me to fly with herthat night by the light of the 
moon, 
But I'll ask my mother, and I'll let you know next Sunday 
afternoon. 
The kindness, & c. 
She made me a 
present of a 
watch and chain likewise a 
bran-new hat, 
For Sundays when I 
walked with her, that I 
might cut it fat; 
But when she found that I 
would not fly with her, she wanted 
the presents back soon, 
But I'll ask my mother, and I'll let you know next Sunday 
afternoon. 
The kindness, &c. 
Out of revenge with one she knew, she ran away that night, 
They both came back for the watch and chain, and wanted 
me to fight; 
He said, " In a 
field if he had me, that he would kill me soon !" 
But I'll ask my mother, and I'll let you know next Sunday 
afternoon. 
The kindness, &c. 
If there's any young girl that's here to-night would like to be 
a 
wife, 
Let her step forward, and I'll do the best for her through life; 
And if she's in a 
hurry, why, we might be married soon, 
But I'll ask my mother, and I'll let you know next Sunday 
afternoon. 
The kindness, Scc.

Brogue and my Blarney and Botherin' Ways. 
As sung by HARRY RICHMOND with great success. 
It's true what I 
say, by the powers above, 
I'm getting quite fat, though I 
live upon love, 
Wid my brogue and my blarney and botherin' ways, 
Five sweethearts I've got and sure I'm inclined 
To marry her first that is first in the mind. 
I 
see them all round in the course of the day, 
And I 
do all I 
can for to keep their hearts gay, 
Wid my brogue, &c. 
The first is a 
spinster, a 
bit passed her prime, 
And I 
call every morning about breakfast time, 
Wid my brogue, &c 
I 
tell her that she can of great beauty boast, 
As I 
swallow her coffee, her eggs, and her toast; 
I 
speak quite respectable and hope that my fate, 
Will be soon join'd to her's in a 
connubial state, 
Wid my brogue, & c. 
At luncheon I 
go to a 
channin' cook-shop— 
On the mistress, sweet Mrs. Maloney, to drop, 
Wid my brogue, &c, 
I 
kiss her, I 
press her, I 
ogle and sigh, 
She'll have me as soon as her husband does die, 
An he's now sick in bed like a 
fowl wid de croup, 
So I 
pledge her bright eyes in a—basin o' soup, 
Wid my brogue, &c. 
A buxom young widow, I 
think it no crime 
Accidently drop on, about dinner time, 
Wid my brogue, &c. 
BROGUE AND MY BLARNEY AND BOTHERIN' WAYS. 
Continued. 
She takes off the cover, I 
see the beef smoke, 
She cuts me a 
slice—then I 
cut her a 
joke, 
She has two little childer' an' I 
make a 
stir, 
For I 
kiss both the childer' an' then I 
kiss her, 
Wid my brogue, &c, 
When with the young widow's old wine I've made free, 
I 
start off in haste, wid the fourth to take tea, 
Wid my brogue, & c. 
I 
go there to supper—it's by her desire, 
I 
eat and I 
drink, and I 
sit by the fire. 
Altho' on her back she has a 
large hunch, 
I 
make her a 
judy—by drinkin' her punch, 
Wid my brogue, & c. 
• 
( 
After drinkin' the punch, I'm inclined for a 
nap, 
So I 
tie on .iny handkerchief for a 
night cap, 
Wid my brogue, & c. 
I 
sit there and doze, an' I 
nod while I 
woo, 
She says that she hopes that as now I'll lie true, 
If I 
should prove false she forever would weep, 
So I 
swear to be constant—and stop there to sleep. 
Wid my brogue, & c. 
When first I 
began, I 
was thin as a 
rat— 
But I'm now like an alderman gettin' quite fat, 
Wid my brogue, & c. 
To gammon a 
meal out of each I 
contrive, 
And faith, if I 
could I 
would marry all five, 
For they're all very rich, as I 
told you before, 
I'll bury them all—then go courting five more, 
Wid my brogue, & c.

The Rocky Road to Dublin. 
Sung with thunders of applause by HARRY RICHMOND. 
In the merry month of June, 
From my home I 
started, 
Left the girls of Tuam, 
Nearly broken-hearted; 
Saluted father dear, 
Kiss'd my darling mother, 
Drank a 
pint of beer, 
My grief and tears to smother; 
Then off to reap the corn, 
And leave where I 
was born, 
I 
cut a 
stout black thorn, 
To banish a 
ghost or goblin. 
In a 
bran new pair of brogues, 
I 
rattled over the bogs, 
And frightened all the dogs, 
On the Rocky Road to Dublin. 
CHORUS. 
Whack-fal-lal-le-ral, Whack-fal-lal-le-ral, 
Whack-fal-lal-le, Whack-fal-lal-le-rido. 
In Mullinger that night, 
I 
rested limbs so weary, 
Started by daylight, 
Next morning light and airy; 
Took a 
drop o' the pure, 
To keep my spirits from sinking, 
That's an Irishman's cure, 
Whenever he's on for drinking. 
To see the lasses smile, 
Laughing all the while, 
At my curious style, 
'Twould set your heart a 
bubblin'. 
They ax'd me if I 
was hired, 
The wages I 
required, 
Till I 
was almost tired, 
Of the Rocky Road to Dublin. ( Cho.) 
In Dublin next arrived, 
I 
thought it such a 
pity, 
To be so soon deprived, 
A 
view of that fine city; 
Then I 
took a 
stroll, 
All among the quality, 
414E,  • 
THE ROCKY ROAD TO DUBLIN— Continued. 
My bundle it was stole, 
In a 
neat locality. 
Something crossed my mind, 
Then I 
looked behind, 
No bundle could I 
find, 
Upon my stick a 
wobblin'. 
Inquiring for the rogue, 
They said my Connaught brogue 
Wasn't much in vogue 
On the Rocky Road to Dublin. (Cho.) 
From there I 
got away, 
My spirits never failin', 
Landed on the quay, 
As the ship was sailin'. 
Captain at me roared, 
Said that no room had he, 
When I 
jumped aboard, 
A 
cabin found for Paddy. 
Down among the pigs, 
I 
played some funny rigs, 
Danced some hearty jigs, 
The water round me bubblin'. 
When off Holyhead, 
I 
wished myself was dead, 
Or better far instead, 
On the Rocky Road to Dublin. (Cho.) 
The boys of Liverpool, 
When we safely landed, 
Called myself a 
fool, 
I 
could no longer stand it. 
Blood began to boil, 
Temper I 
was losin', 
Poor ould Erin's Isle, 
They began abusin'. 
Hurra my soul, says I, 
My shillaleh I 
let fly, 
Some Galway boys were by, 
Saw I 
was a 
hobble in, 
Then with a 
loud hurrah, 
They joined in the affray, 
(Spoken) 
Faugh-a-ballagh, 
We quickly cleared the way, 
For the Rocky Road to Dublin. (Cho.)

Pretty Jeminm. 
Written and sung by H ARRY RICHMOND with greabapplause. 
My love she lives in a 
two- pair back, 
Her eyes are bright as stars of night 
Of falling in love I've got a 
knack, 
And she's the girl for me. 
At six o'clock she leaves off work, 
At seven she's finished her tea, 
At eight she's dress'd in all her best, 
And she comes for a 
walk with me. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, pretty Jemima, don't say no, 
Oh, hi oh ! don't say no, 
Pretty jemima, don't say no, 
And we will married be. 
was once afraid to speak outright •, 
I 
was so shy I 
feared to try : 
The thought of it put me all in a 
fright, 
So I'd grizzle and pine all day. 
I 
was getting as thin as a 
scaffold pole, 
My buttons all fell away. 
And just because I 
hadn't the nerve 
To pluck up courage and say, 
Oh ! pretty Jemima, & c. 
We went for a 
walk not long ago ; 
Thinks I, somehow, I'll tell her now ; 
PRETTY JEMIMA. 
Continued. 
I 
just was going to let her know, 
When she spied a 
milliner's shop ; 
A 
hat and feathers was there for sale, 
I 
couldn't do less than stop, 
By the time I 
had bought it toy courage had gone, 
And I 
couldn't the question pop. 
Oh ! pretty Jemima, & c. 
At last one morning I 
bought the ring, 
And hit on a 
plan to make me a 
man; 
Thinks I 
to myself this is the thing, 
This night shall cast the die. 
I 
held it up ; " Look ye here," I 
said. 
4 
The moment it caught her eye, 
Her lovely cheeks were suffused with red, 
And seeing no one was by, I 
said, 
Oh ! pretty Jemima, &c. 
Of course I 
was anxious to know my fate, 
I 
almost dread the words I 
said; 
'Whether to be with joy elate, 
Or be the most wretched of men. 
She tried it on her finger and said, 
'Twas a 
little too large, but then 
I 
could buy a 
keeper, and we'd get wed, 
Next Saturday morning at ten, 
Oh! pretty Jemima, &c.

. Faithless Maria of Washington Square. 
Written and sung by HARRY RICHMOND with great success. 
0, pity me, pray, and hear what I've to say, 
For my bosom has been set on fire 
By one I 
considered as true as the day— 
But, alas ! she's a 
faithless Maria. 
And when I 
recount all my troubles and woes, 
And miseries, which to you I'll now disclose, 
You will say in this world you could hardly suppose 
There was such a 
false maid as Maria. 
CHORUS. 
I 
may be to blame, but I 
love her th 
Though my feelings she's tried 
She's as false as she's fair, two 
And she lives up in Wash' 
I'm a 
journeyman ha

On a 
Saturday night in September; 
Maria, a 
cook, and her elegant look 
I 
shall ever have cause to remember.

would go with my bread,

FAITHLESS MARIA OF WASHINGTON SQUARE. 
Continued: 
I 
called every morning, and how she would run 
When I 
knocked and shouted out " Baker !" 
And smiled, too, beside, when I 
said for my bride 
I 
would take her and never forsake her. 
But a 
policeman came on the Washington Square beat, 
And as they're always looking for something to eat, 
No matter if pudding stale, or cold meat, 
Of course he made love to Maria. 
I 
may be to blame, &c. 
At last when I 
asked her to settle the day, 
She said with a 
smile of derision, 
" 
I 
would rather marry my officer bold, 
Who belongs to the P. 0. Division." 
" 
What ! deceive a 
poor baker, who loves you true ?" 
She only said" Rubbish !" and answered " Poo-poo !" 
My heart it went down like a 
lump of stale dough, 
As I 
took a 
last look at Maria. 
I 
may be to blame, &c. 
I 
weep and I 
cry, I 
shall pine, I 
shall die, 
For each day I 
grow thinner and thinner; 
I 
grieve at my meals, whether supper or tea, 
And I 
fret at my breakfast and dinner. 
You can see at a 
glance that I'm wasting away, 
Like butter exposed on a 
hot summer's day. 
I 
nearly drop down when I 
hear the folks say, 
" 
There's the baker who once loved Maria." 
I 
may be to blame, &c.

Shelling Green -
Peas. 
First sung in America by H ARRY RictimoND, with tremendous applause. 
I 
sing you a 
ditty, of damsel so pretty, 
Who lived from the city some seventeen miles ; 
Her name is Maria, her worthy old sire 
Was clerk and town crier—his name was John Styles. 
With lips like the cherry, a 
smile, too, so merry, 
I 
thought her the very one suited to please, 
And when I 
first met her, and tried hard to get her, 
For worse or for better, she was 'shelling green peas. 
CHORUS. 
Under the trees, a 
bowl on her knees, 
Maria sat silently shelling green peas. 
I'd long lov'd her dearly, truly, sincerely, 
At length I 
thought, really, I'd settle in life ; 
Although aged fifty, I'd been very thrifty, 
And thought ' twas high time to be taking a 
Nvife. 
With bosom on fire, in search of Maria, 
Thro' lanes of wild-brier, o'er-shadow'd by trees ; 
I 
stroll'd to the spot where, outside her cot there, 
She was sitting so patiently shelling green peas. 
Under the trees, & c. 
I 
step up unto her, commencing to woo her, 
I 
said " That no truer fond heart could be found 
Than mine, if she'd take me some morning, and make me 
The happiest mortal for twenty miles round." 
gro. 
SHELLING GREEN PEAS. 
Continued. 
.1 said, " Our life might be one round of delight, 
'Like the little birds singing upon the green trees." 
To a 
whisper then dropping my voice without stopping, 
The question was popping, as she popped the peas. 
Under the trees, &c. 
No answer she made, and I 
was much afraid 
That this beautiful maid had not heard all I 
said. 
At her feet kneeling, I 
tried to be stealing 
A 
kiss—when came reeling her hand on my head; 
" 
Do you think I'd engage," she cried out in a 
rage, 
"With a 
man twice my age, so clear out if you please." 
In a 
terrible passion, at me she sent crashing, 
On my head smashing the bowl of green peas." 
Under the tree:, & c. 
By way of addenda, she said, " Sir, remember 
That May and December can never unite, 
Your leave, sir, be taking," my neck nearly breaking, 
I 
made my escape in a 
terrible fright. 
I 
never will marry, but single will tarry 
Tho' friends and acquaintances do nothing but tease, 
Whenever they meet me, in this style they greet me, 
" 
Old boy, what's the price now of lamb and green 
peas?" 
CHORUS. 
Yes, how they tease, whenever they please, 
By shouting out after me, " Lamb and green peas."

Many Can Help One. 
Sung with great success by HARRY RICHMOND. 
Some very good sayings I've heard in my time, 
And some I 
believe to be true; 
The one I 
will mention to-night in my song 
Is one that is well known to you; 
If you meet a 
man who is down in the world. 
And assistance you can't give him any 
Remember that many can always help one, 
Where one cannot always help many. 
CHORUS. 
Then give what you can to those in distress, 
Let it be a 
dime or a 
penny, 
For many can help one, I've heard people say. 
Where one cannot always help many. 
How often a 
trifle would save a 
man's life 
When he is near dying from want; 
He's tried to live honest all through his lifetime, 
But finds in the end that he can't; 
At last he is tempted to steal or to starve, 
His rich friends they all pass him by, 
They heed not his wishes, they care not his wants, 
He's left like a 
dog there to die. ( Cho.) 
A man may be wealthy one end of the year 
The next one be wretched and poor; 
He's struggled his hardest to keep himself up 
But has sunk down to poverty's door; 
Such men as these deserve your support, 
So give it to them who most need, 
For those who've experienced poverty know 
'Tis a 
very hard battle indeed. ( Cho) 
I 
hope what I've mentioned to-night in my song, 
That nothing I've said out of place 
A man may be poor but still honest be 
For poverty, ' tis no disgrace , 
Then give what you can with a 
generous heart 
No knowing when the tide it may turn • 
Just give him a 
chance to rise up in the worll, 
And your kindness he's sure to return.

My Mary Ann Imitates Pat Rooney. 
Words and music by SHEEHAN and M cGLoNE. Sung by 
the great JOHN REILLY. 
Arrah, give me your attention every one, 
And hear what I've to say ; 
It's all about a 
daughter of mine 
That's bound to have her way. 
She goes to the theatre every night, 
For the stage sure she's got spooney, 
And now she's got a 
date, and is making out first-rate, 
Imitating a 
play actor called Rooney. 
CHORUS. 
On the stage she walks, shure she catches the gawks, 
By my sowl I 
think she's looney; 
On me she's brought disgrace since she went off her base, 
Imitating a 
play actor called Rooney. (Dance.) 
Sure she sends out letters every day, 
And tells me she's writing for dates, 
And I 
ask her for God's sake to give it up, 
She says go away your feet ain't mates. 
Sure the actors all give her the laugh, 
And say that her act is Juney ; 
The gillies she does mash, she gets seven dollars cash, 
For imitating a 
play actor called Rooney. 
CHORUS. 
Shure she washed up in Pat Rooney's sponge, 
And stole his dialect; 
She tried to do his funny run off, 
And nearly broke her neck. 
(Dance.)

A RECITATION. 
Words and music written by PAT M CGLONE, of SHEEHAN and 
MCGLONE, especially for the PHILLIPS BROTHERS. 
Oh here we are two colored men, 
So every one does say, 
We both did run for office 
On last election day. 
Of course we were elected 
By a 
majority of In), 
And every one does greet us as 
The colored Aldermen. 
CHORUS. 
(Business.) 
We'll sing and dance for you all night, 
Our style is Upper Ten. 
To please you all is our delight— 
We're two colored aldermen. 
When we were in our Southern home, 
We were not satisfied, 
We took a 
notion for to roam 
To see this world wide. 
We traveled North, East and West, 
To the South we'll go again, 
Where we'll be re-elected as 
The colored aldermen, 
(I)ance.) 
(Business.) 
We'll sing and dance for you, &c. 
(Dance off.) 
Written by SHEEHAN and MCGLONE. 
Respectfully dedicated 
to JOHN REILLY. 
O'Reilley owned a 
billy goat 
And a 
great buck goat was he, 
He would buck almost any thing 
That he'd happen for to see. 
And if at night he'd roam the streets 
And a 
drunken man he'd meet, 
He'd buck him till he was sick and tired, 
.A nd then his clothes he'd eat— 
O'Reilley's billy goat. 
He knew every policeman on the beat, 
And he knew if him they found 
That he'd spend a 
short vacation 
Down here in the city pound. 
He ate Mrs. Mulligan's underclothes 
That was hanging on the line, 
Shure he bucked a 
Dutchman in the belly, 
And knocked him out of time— 
O'Reilley's billy goat. 
But every goat must have his day, 
And this goat's day did come— 
He met a 
butcher's dog one day, 
And the dog for him did run. 
He chased the goat through the streets, 
Shure the dog for him was too smart, 
He chased him till he lost his wind 
And he died of a 
broken heart— 
O'Reilley's billy goat. 
Now, down here in a 
vacant lot 
In a 
corner quite alone, 
There we buried O'Reilley's goat, 
And over him raised a 
stone ; 
And perchance you'd pass that way, 
You'll find those words on it are wrote: 
Sacred to the memory of 
O'Reilley's great buck goat. 
Written, composed and sung by W ISL J. 
SCANLON, in SCANLON CRONIN'S 
famous sketch, entitled 
Life tn a 
Tenement House." 
I've got a 
daughter I 
talk to all day, 
But the devil a 
word will she mind what I 
say, 
In spite of advice she'll go far away, 
Sometimes she cannot be found. 
If I 
say stay at home, begorra she'll get mad, 
She'll call me an ould tad, say I've got them bad, 
Inside of an oyster I 
ought to be clad, 
To a 
nannie goat I 
ought to be bound. 
CHORUS. 
Ah, but if I 
catch the man 
That taught her to dance 
The la-de-da dance, the tra-le-la dance, 
On the top of his nose I'll make my fist prance, 
And twist off the both of his legs, ha, ha! 
iRePeat• 
At night she'll put on her fol-de-lol-lols, 
Then she'll skip off to her picnics and balls, 
Then on the neighbors she'll make her grand calls, 
Borrow all the clothes that she can. 
For a 
bustle she'll wear my coderie pants, 
My chin-chilly vest, or anything by chance, 
But if I 
catch the laddie-buck that taught her to dance, 
I'll twist off the both of his legs.

Fellows may be better looking, 
Richer, wiser than myself, 
But I've a 
gift I 
greatly value, 
More than beauty, sense, or pelf; 
For I 
possess a 
style and manner, 
Loved by ev'ry girl I 
see, 
A 
flirting, teasing, pleasing way—that 
Tickles them and just suits me. 
SPOKEN.— Just my 
little peculiarity, a 
style of my own that tickles 
them. I 
don't know what it is, you know, but there's something 
about me they like, because  
CHORUS. 
It tickles the ladies immensely, you know! 
It tickles the ladies, wherever I 
go; 
It tickles the ladies, they like it, and so--
They think I 
shall marry—but—oh 
dear no! 
In position quite romantic 
With my hand my heart upon, 
I 
sigh, as though I'd lost the power 
Of ar-ti-cu-la-ti-on I 
Then, in tones as low and gentle 
As a 
cooing turtle dove, 
Say—well— something sentimental, 
Look—but do not speak my love. 
SPoKEN.—That's how it's done, this spooney business tickles them 
—and they are in no hurry lor you to come to the point; they don't 
care for it to be too soon over for the longer a 
flirtation lasts, the 
more— 
It tickles the ladies, etc. 
Though my heart with love may tingle, 
I 
ne'er lose my hand or head, 
For I 
know I 
must keep single, 
I 
should lose my power if wed. 
Though I 
might be still as pleasing, 
Still as youthful, fond, and gay, 
I 
should find the charm was broken 
From the fatal wedding day. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, it would be all up, the sport would be over, the bird 
would be caged, and nobody but my better-half would admit, that--
It tickles the ladies, etc.

If I 
was only long enough, 
A 
soldier I 
would be, 
The girl I 
thought would be my wife, 
Has proved so false to me. 
She's turned me up, and now walks out, 
With one she calls her swain, 
Whose whims and psalms outdone my charms, 
And nearly turned my brain 
SPOKEN.—Yes, I'm mad. 
To think the girl— the only one I 
ever loved—should give me up for another. 
And— 
CHORUS. 
If I 
was only long enough, a 
soldier I 
would be, 
To fight fot my country, and be revenged on she. 
Then if a 
war broke out, she'd never see me more, 
But away, yes away, I'd go off to the war. 
The donkey rides I've had with her, 
The shrimps, the lovely teas, 
And trousers that cost twelve and six, 
I've worn out at the knees; 
Through making love, like fellows do, 
In some secluded spot; 
But all my spooning was in vain, 
The girl she loved me not 
23 
SPOKEN. — She loved another. 
A woman that would fool a 
man that had paid sixpence in one day for ginger beer and don-
key rides, is not worthy the name of woman. 
She's—well, 
never mind. 
If I 
was, etc. 
At night I 
dream of battle fields, 
And fancy I 
am there, 
With blood all round, and cannon balls 
All flying in the air; 
And on the field I 
met the wretch, 
Who's caused our love to part, 
And as we're standing face to face, 
I 
stab him through the heart. 
SPOKEN,—Iia! ha! ha! 
I 
stab him to the heart. 
If I 
was, etc. 
Short soldiers at the seat of war, 
Have gained old England fame, 
And p'raps Joe Smith of Seven Dials, 
Will make as great a 
name-
And she that's proved so false to me, 
May see my name inscribed, 
In the annals of her country, ha, 
Among the brave that died. 
SPOKEN,—Drunk— 
If I 
was, etc.

Sung with great success by the Duncan Sisters, CARRIE AND 
SOPHIE. 
Words by HARRY MONTAGUE. 
Music by HARRY BENNETT. 
JUST for a 
change I 
thought I'd go 
To the seaside out of town, • 
To battle each morning in the surf 
Then wander up and down. 
While strolling there on one fine day 
I 
met a 
charming beau; 
He asked me if I'd walk with him? 
Of course I'd not say no—for 
CHORUS. 
It's nice! it's nice! 
Now don't you think it is so? 
It's nice! it's nice! 
Now that's what they exclaim. 
It's nice! it's nice! 
Now don't you think so`) 
Everybody says so, 
And of course we say the same. 
Then arm in arm along the beach 
For hours we did roam. 
He whispered tales of love 
As we returned towards home. 
He begged to see me to my door. 
I 
answered " No, my dear, 
But to-night at seven, if you'll wait, 
I'll meet you on the pier." 
It's nice, etc. 
We met that night and then I 
found 
How dearly he loved me; 
And now I'm soon to be his wife, 
How happy I 
will be. 
He whispered tales of love, and said 
" 
Don't be so timid, Miss, 
And now my little darlinz please 
Give me one little kiss." 
SPORLM—Of 
course, as we were engaged to be married, 
I 
couldn't refuse a 
kiss; and besides— 
It's nice, etc.

THE CANDIDATE FOR ALDERMAN. 
An original Irish Comic Song as written and sung by JAMES 
O'NEIL the great Irish Comedian and Vocalist with tremendous 
success, at the various theatres of the United States. 
I 
AM a 
true born Irishman, and I'll ne'er deny the same, 
I 
took a 
notion to cfoss the ocean, to America I 
came. 
When I 
landed here, it was in the year 1862. 
I 
was willing to fight, both day and night, for the Red, White 
and the Blue. 
CHORUS. 
I 
am your Candidate for Alderman, so believe me what I 
say, 
Put on your coats, and cast your votes, for me on Election day. 
When I 
started first in Politics, my friends they were but few, 
I 
can't forget, everyone I 
met, said that I 
was too "brand new." 
I 
worked the pipes on the Boulevard, along with Mickey Hart, 
He was foreman over the old sixth ward, and the owner of a 
big ash- cart. 
I 
am your candidate. Itc. 
So now my friends I 
must be off, I 
can no longer stay, 
I 
hope you wont forget to vote, for me .on Election day. 
And if I 
am the lucky man, on me you may depend, 
If you want to borrow, I 
wont be sorry, for I 
am the poor-mares 
friend. 
__ I 
am your candidate, <tc._

Underneath the sweet magnolia, now, remember what I "tole yer,” 
That's the place I 
met Miss Kitty Allalee, 
Where the sweet magnolia blossom, shed its petals on her bosom, 
And I 
had to brush them off so tenderly. 
But she seemed to half decline when I 
asked her to be mine; 
Then I 
pressed her closer to my loving breast, 
Till she said you may relent it, hasty weddings are repented, 
That was all she said, but you can guess the rest,

GENTEEL SONG AND DANCE. 
Composed by JAMES R. WALsH. Performed by WALSH and K
G. 
When the stars are shining brightly 
In the azure dome above, 
And the dews are falling lightly 
I 
go to see my love. 
I 
meet her at our trysting, 
Near the Cottage by the lane, 
And while the hours are passing, 
Our love we tell again. 
CHORUS. 
When the stars are shining brightly, 
An evening comes again, 
Then I 
haste to see my charmer, 
In the Cottage by the lane. 
Close beside a 
latticed window. 
In the arbor by the gate, 
When the rosy sun is setting, 
Impatiently I 
wait. 
When the door she opens softly, 
And welcomes me again, 
Then I 
feel like never leaving 
The Cottage by the lane. 
When the stars, &c, 
Only a 
Sweet Little Letter. 
Published by permission of COLLINS It BUXTON, Portland, Me. 
It is only a 
sweet little letter, 
In my hand that I 
tenderly hold, 
From the one who is dearer and better 
Than the treasure of jewels and gold. 
Many days my poor heart has been sighing 
For this mark of affection to see, 
So then now there is no use denying 
I'm as happy as happy can be. 
CHORUS. 
It is only a 
sweet little letter, 
Whose glad coming I've waited to see, 
Yes, a 
dear little, sweet little letter, 
Just a 
sweet little letter for me. 
It is only a 
sweet little letter, 
But its pages are fill'd with kind words, 
Whose affection is dearer, yes better, 
Than sweet music or carols of birds. 
Oh, they waken glad mem'ries to cheer me, 
As I 
wander afar on life's sea, 
While the sweetest of thoughts linger near me, 
I'm as happy as happy can be. 
It is only a 
sweet little letter, &c. 
It is only a 
sweet little letter, 
But it tells of a 
heart that is true, 
Of a 
love that grows brighter and better 
As the days fade away from my view. 
Yes, it breathes of the fondest devotion, 
That will cling now and ever to me, 
And my heart in its tend'rest emotion, 
I'm as happy as happy can be. 
It is pnly a 
sweet little letter, 8cc.

"Measure fail: Wants by Your Means." 
My Blue-Eyed Dan. 
IRISII SONG AND DANCE. 
Sung by Emsn. W HITNEY, of the W HITNEY'S, in their character -sketch, 
" 
Rehearsal in the Parlor." 
Oh, my heart is filled with joy, 
I 
scarce know what to say 
About my darling blue-eyed Dan, 
I 
think of night and day. 
'Twas on last Sunday that we met 
Among the sweet grape vines, 
And the little birds were singing forth 
Their sweet, harmonious rhymes. 
Cuonus. 
And I 
feel just as happy as a 
little red rose 
That blooms down in the shady lane, 
The sun shines from the sky so liright, 
On my pretty darling little blue-eyed Dan. 
He dresses neat, his voice is sweet 
As the sound of a 
silvery bell, 
And often times I 
run away. 
To meet him in the dell. 
He met me at the orchard gate 
Last Sunday eve at nine, 
And whispered love tales in my car, 
And I'm sure he will be mine. 
(Chorus.) 
• is 
Sung by H ARRY BECKWITH. 
I 
once heard a 
proverb, worth 'graving in gold, 
'Twas spoken in years that are past, 
And he too is gone who made it his own, 
But while there's a 
world it will last. 
The saying was pithy, its meaning was this: 
Which ever way Providence leans, 
If what fortune grants won't come up to your wants:, 
You must bring down your wants to your means. 
CHORUS. 
So think of my song as you journey along, 
Thro' life and its changeable scenes, 
If your wants prove too high for your means ta sappZI, 
Why bring down your wants to your means. 
How often we see the gay man of the world, 
With money and plenty to spare, 
Did he use it aright, but he puts it to flight, 
And appears as tho' short of his share, 
Then he pays twenty shillings to borrow a 
pound, 
Till his folly no longer he screens, 
Thus he parts with his wealth, loses station and health, 
Thro' his wants overrunning his means. 
So think of my song, Sze. 
The roughhanded ploughman, up early and late, 
Whose days with hard toil are beset, 
If he's scanty of clothes, it is nothing he owes, 
So he's richer than him who's in debt. 
For if homely his fare, he is happy withal, 
Tho' it's little from learning he gleans, 
And he never needs run from a 
bailiff or dun, 
For he measures his wants by his means. 
So think of my song, 8,:c 
Then ye who have little, and ye who have much, 
Enjoy what you've got in content; 
Nor squander your store and your health getting more; 
Live right, and you'll never repent. 
This world is a 
garden with pleasure well filled 
Tho' sorrow sometimes intervenes, 
But troubles will fly, as the clouds drifting by, 
If you " measure your wants by your means." 
So think of my song, Scc.

First She Would and Then She Wouldn't. 
As sang with immense success by Master GEORGE A, 
MURRAY, 
the rising Young Comic. 
TO an eveninT party once I 
went and met such a 
nice young, 
girl, 
Dressed oh, so fine and smothered in scent, my heart soon fel.; 
in a 
whirl, 
I 
asked her it she'd dance with me, she looked at me and smiled, 
She wouldn't say yes, she wouldn't say no, she'd quite a 
pecu-
liar style. 
CHORUS. 
First she would and then she wouldn't, 
Then she smiled and said she couldn't, 
Then she said, oh George, you shouldn't, 
You're a 
naughty, naughty man. 
I 
sat down by the fair one's side and gave her wine and cake, 
I 
told her what I'd do and dare all for her own dear sake, 
She then looked up at me and smiled, I 
took that smile for bliss, 
And when the time for parting came, I 
tried to steal a 
kiss. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, ladies and gentlemen I, came very near doing 
It too, but she was one of those peculiar souls that— 
First she, &c. 
I 
thought it was time and so I 
had the business put on a 
spec, 
( 
sent my love a 
new silk dress her darling self to deck,

Upon the wedding morn t 
called my intended bride to and, 
Kot dressed at all and worst of all, she'd hadn't made up her 
mind.

Well after that we married were, and live pretty nice a home, 
fhere's one thing which my wife objects that's when I 
wish W 
roam, 
he says fiat home's the proper place for all good married 
men,

Good-Bye, Lovely Lou. 
Written and sung by Gus W ILLIAMS, the greatest of all vocalists, with 
tremendous success. 
Copyright, 1879, by Louis P. GOULLARD. 
'Twas early in the month of May, - 
I 
said to my girl Lou; 
As I 
am going far away, 
I'm going to ask if you 
Will constant be while I'm at sea, 
She bowed her lovely head. 
Then placed her tiny hands in mine, 
And 1 
to her then said, 
CHORUS. 
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye lovely Lou, 
Think of me when I'm at sea, and I 
will think of you. 
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye lovely Lou, 
Think of me when I'm at sea and I 
will thinl- of you. 
She said, to you I 
will be true, 
To do the same I 
ought; 
Tho' I 
am told you sailors 
Have a 
wife in every port. 
I 
said, " Now Lou don't look so blue, 
Or think me so unkind, 
I 
never could forget 
The girl I 
left behind." 
Good-bye, & c. 
I've one thing, Lou, to tell to you, 
Before the seas I 
roam, 
And that is of the presents 
I 
am going to bring you home. 
An Indian shawl, a 
parasol, 
A 
tiny kangaroo; 
A monkey and a 
parrot, yes, 
And they are all for you. 
Good-bye, &c. 
I 
bid adieu to lovely Lou, 
We parted on the shore, 
And something seemed to tell me 
I 
should never see her more. 
When I 
returned I 
quickly learned, 
That she had gone away; 
So now, as Lou has proved untrue, 
Why I 
can only say— 
Good-bye, & c. 
Go to Sleep my Little Darling. 
Published by permission of COLLINS & BUXTON, Portland, Me. 
Go to sleep, my little darling, 
Rest on mother's loving breast, 
And the angels will protect you 
When within your cradle rest; 
Far above the starry heavens, 
They are looking down on you, 
So repose, my precious darling, 
Close your tiny eyes of blue. 
CHORUS. 
Go to sleep, my little darling, 
Rest your head on mother's breast, 
And the angels will protect you, 
When within your cradle rest. 
Far a-down the dewy meadow, 
All the daises are asleep, 
And the birdies in the branches 
Also are in slumber deep. 
But in Eden far above ns, 
Angel eyes are open wide, 
And you are as safe, my darling, 
Ls if they were at your side. 
Go to sleep, &c. 
In the early morning, darling, 
Little robin in the tree 
'Will awake you from your slumber, 
When he sings his merry glee. 
Then I'll take you to my bosom, 
Till the glimmer on the plain 
Tells us that the sun is shining, 
And the day tias come again. 
Go to sleep, &c, 
As sung by EMMA ROGERS in the original sketch written by HARRY MC 
AVOY, entitled " Going to the Raffle." 
Oh, I 
am in love, but I'll not tell with whom, 
For I 
know very well what some folks would do— 
They'd chatter and flatter and make themselves fine, 
And poor little somebody have a 
sad time. 
CHORUS. 
So I'll tell nobody, I'll tell nobody, 
I'll tell nobody, nobody, no. 
So I'll tell nobody, I'll tell nobody, 
I'll tell nobody, nobody, no. 
If I'd tell it to one she would tell it to two, 
The next cup of tea they'd plot what they'd do. 
And as men have no constancy in their own minds, 
He'd seek a 
new face and leave some one behind. 
So I'll tell nobody, &c. 
But when I 
am sure that his heart's all my own, 
That he loves me sincerely and never will roam, 
Oh, then I'll defy all their jeers and their taunts, 
For it shows very plain what it is each of them wants 
CHORUS. 
They all want somebody, they're dying for somebody, 
Somebody, somebody, I 
know who. 
So I'll tell nobody, I'll tell nobody; 
tell nobody, nobody, no, 
Did you ever consider some time when you've tried 
To accomplish some purpose or aim, 
;With which unfamiliar you happen to be, 
That it oft proves a 
difficult game; 
But it's useless to grumble or growl at your lot, 
Or let ill-temper ruffle your brow, 
Keep on with good courage, you'll surely succeed— 
It's easy enough when you learn how. 
CHORUS. 
If you cannot accomplish the object in view, 
There's no use in raising a 
row, 
Though at first unsuccessful, you surely will find 
It's easy enough when you learn how. 
If with some charming girl you are deeply in love, 
And her hand you are trying to win, 
YOu are anxious your feelings for her to disclose, 
But you scarcely know how to begin; 
You stammer and mumble, grow re I 
in the face, 
While your love you are trying to vow, 
'Till at last it slips out and the question you pop— 
It's easy enough when you learn how. 
If you cannot, etc. 
Now although we've been married for several years, 
My wife discontented has grown, 
To think while our neighbors with children are blest, 
We have none we can claim for our own ; 
I 
should feel very sad if I 
thought throughout life, 
It ;would always be as it is now, 
But perhaps in the future it may come out all right— 
It's easy enough when you learn how.

Linger near me, little treasure, 
When I 
have you by my side 
I 
forget all care and trouble. 
And that ill may life betide. 
I 
remember only, darling, 
That the one I 
love is near, 
In the sunlight of your presence 
All the shadows disappear, 
CHORUS. 
Linger near me, little treasure, 
Oh, how rich a 
man am I! 
Not a 
king on earth is richer, 
For no gold your love can buy. 
Linger near me, little treasure, 
Let me look into your eyes, 
Where the sweetest violets blossom 
Underneath the summer skies. 
Put your hand in mine, my darling, 
And believe the words I 
speak ; 
Never any rose was fairer 
Than the roses on thy cheek. 
Linger near me, 
Linger near me, little treasure, 
While the days are passing by, 
Meet me with a 
kiss at nightfall, 
And the love-light in your eye. 
Oh, my darling, life without you 
Would a 
dreary journey be, 
Let me keep you always near me, 
For you're all the world to me. 
Linger near mc. &c.

Little Sweetlips, Keep Your Kisses. 
Published by permission of PHIL. P. 
IC zn., McKeespot*, Pa. 
Little sweetlips, keep your kisses, 
Each and ev'ry one for me, 
Keep them all for one who misses 
Them so far away from thee. 
Mine the only right to gather 
All their sweetness full and free, 
So, while parted, I 
would rather 
Have you keep each kiss for me. 
CHORUS. 
Little it weetlips, keep your kisses, 
Keep them ev'ry one for me, 
Till my heart no longer misses 
All their sweetness full and free. 
Little sweetlips, keep your kisses, 
It will not be very long; 
Let none steal away the blisses 
That you know to me belong. 
Do not sigh because I 
wander 
Just a 
little while from thee, 
Absence but will make me fonder 
Of the kisses kept for me. 
Little sweetlips, &e. 
Little sweetlips, keep your kisses, 
And to me be always true, 
None my heart so truly misses 
As each little kiss and you. 
Soon again to you returning, 
I 
your sunny face shall see; 
Men how sweet to me the learning 
Ev'ry kiss is kept for me. 
Little sweetlips, &c. 
Why are you silent and sad, love, 
Filling nV poor heart with pain ? j 
Lives like your own should be glad, love, 
Smile on me sweetly again ; 
Surely I 
never can leave thee, 
Here with those tears on thy cheeks, 
What have I 
done thus to grieVe thee ? 
Speak to me, love, only speak, 
CHORUS. 
Speak to me then, only speak, love, 
Why are those tears on thy cheeks, 
Give me the answer I 
seek, love, 
Speak to me, love, only speak. 
Lives like your own cannot liVe, love, 
Always in sorrow and pain, 
Whisper you gladly forgive, love, 
Kiss and be happy again; 
Cease then your weary repining, 
Banish the tear from thy cheek, 
With my arms round you entwining, 
Speak to me, love, only speak, 
Speak to me, then, etc.

Of games ve played, of fun ve had,

Of sentences they used to give, 
So difficult to say.

She stood at the gate welcoming him in,

Ant: " Hand in Hand We Wander." Written by EDDIE SANDS, and 
sung by KEATING and SANns. 
You tell me that you love me. 
With a 
passion pure and high 
As the heavens that bend above me 
When the day-god warms the sky; 
You vow that you will cherish 
My memory whilst you live, 
That you will let no feeling perish 
While you've life-blood yet to give. 
You say that you are truthful 
As aught beneath the sun, 
That you will let no ivy ruthful 
My flowers of bliss o'errun ; 
Yet of hearts I'm an inspector, 
And I 
know thine, link by link, 
At its founts of bubbling nectar 
Any one that will may drink. 
And although you may replenish 
It for me, my dainty lip 
Will never taste the remish 
From the goblet others sip. 
Words and music written for HARRY BECKWITH by ARTHUR W. 
FRENCH. 
As you pass day by day thro' life's crowded highway 
You will find it is hard to succeed ; 
There'll be many a 
time, as the hillside you climb, 
When you'll wish for a 
friend in your need. 
For this troublesome life it is only a 
strife 
As to who shall rise up or descend; 
If a 
man is not blind he will very soon find 
That his pocketbook is his best friend. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, a 
friend in our need is a 
true friend indeed, 
Upon this you may truly depend; 
And to give, or to lend, or to beg, borrow, spend, 
A 
man's pocketbook is his best friend. 
There are friends you deem true they will linger near you 
In the smiles of prosperity's hours, 
lint in poverty's day they will vanish away 
Like the fading of sweet summer flowers. 
As you wander alone, quite forgotten, unknown, 
And misfortunes upon you descend, 
In that sorrowful day you'll be quite apt to say— 
Yes, my pocketbook was their best friend. 
Yes, a 
friend in our, &c. 
You may be very poor, so you cannot secure 
What you need for the loved ones at home; 
For their wants to provide to beg you decide, 
As you out in the dreary street wan. 
There some old friend you meet and your story repeat, 
Not a 
dollar he'll give you or lend; 
And you say with a 
sigh, as he passes you by, 
Yes, his pocketbook is his best friend. 
Ves, a 
friend in our, Sze.

At eight years of age, although not a 
fool, 
I 
went every day, of course, to my school. 
I 
romped with the girls, and would not let them be, 
So the school teacher gave the old lecture to me: 
You may look, etc. 
When I 
grew a 
young man, I 
loved a 
sweet maid, 
And although she loved me, she was rather too staid. 
I 
dared not embrace her, or ask for a 
kiss, 
U I 
did, the reply from my love would be this: 
You may look, etc 
When we were engaged, I 
said, No one could blame, • 
So her scruples in that way I 
soon overcame. 
This dear little darling, I 
married one day, 
When I 
now want a 
kiss, you will not hear her cay: 
You may look, etc.

On I 
fancy brings a 
thought to me 
Of flowers sweet and rare, 
With grace and beauty there combined, 
And brightest hues so fair— 
So like a 
maiden that I 
loved— 
It was my happy lot: 
I 
whispered when we parted last— 
" 
Oh I 
you'll forget me not!" 
CRORUS. 
Graceful and as charming as a 
lily in the pond— 
Time has passed so swiftly—for, of her I 
am so fond--
Dasies and the roses, too, they grow around the spot 
Where we parted and I 
whispered— 
" 
You'll forget me not I " 
(Dance) 
We met—I 
really don't know where— 
But still ' tis all the same— 
'or love walks in the busy streets 
As well as in the lane: 
I 
gently pressed her tiny hand: 
She glanced at me a 
shot— 
She dropped a 
flower, I 
picked it up— 
A 
sweet forget-me-not I 
(Chorus and Dance.) 
At last there came a 
happy day 
And something that I 
said 
Just caused her lips to murmur " yes I " 
And shortly we were wed. 
A 
little cottage by the brook, 
And a 
tiny garden spot 
Where grows a 
little flower called— 
A sweet forget-me-not!

Some Girls Do and Some Girls Don t. 
Of all the strangest girls on earth, 
I 
think my girl's the one; 
You know she has peculiar ways, 
And quite devoid of fun. 
She never sees a 
joke of mine, 
Whenever humor flows, 
But gives me a 
disdainful look 
And quite turns up her nose. 
SPOKEN—Some girls like a 
little joke, you know, but mine 
don't, she turns her nose up at it. 
I 
think she works it on 
the same principle as this (turning up nose with finger). 
CIIORUS. 
Some girls do, and some girls don't, 
Some girls will, but my girl won't ; 
I 
tried very hard to see if she would, 
She said she really couldn't, and I 
don't think she could. 
I 
took my love to see the play, 
As other fellahs do ; 
And thought that she'd enjoy herself, 
She cried the whole night through. 
And when we reached the street again, 
Some oysters I 
proposed, 
But she said, "No, not me, young man," 
Still turning up her nose. 
SPOKEN—Up 
it went again at. three dozen of the best 
Saddle Rocks, just think of that. 
To see a 
girl turn up her 
nose at five cents a 
time. 
I 
said, " Well, my love, if you 
47 
won't have any supper, we will have a 
cab and go home." 
She replied, " No, young man, no four-wheeled cabs for me 
at this time of night." 
Some girls do, Sce. 
We met one Sunday afternoon, 
For a 
day in Central Park; 
And when we mounted " One tree hill" 
We had, well, say a 
lark ! 
'Georgina said, " You know, young man, 
Some girls prefer a 
stroll ; 
Not me, when I'm in Central Park 
I 
dearly love a 
roll!" 
SPOKEN—Now, there's an extraordinary girl for you. 
Of 
course, I 
wanted to take her for a 
nice quiet lover's walk in 
some shady lane, but she said she'd prefer a 
roll. 
Then I 
wanted to talk to her of love, romance, and poetry, but no, 
she said she'd " sooner have a 
good dinners" 
Well, 
Some girls do, & c. 
Not long ago my uncle died 
And left me fifty pounds; 
As soon as I 
received the news 
My joy it knew no bounds. 
I 
thought, well, I 
will marry now, 
So I 
at once proposed; 
But when I 
mentioned the amount 
Up went her lovely nose. 
SPOKEN—The bad girl, she said she ought to have five 
hundred with such a 
man as me. I 
thought she would have 
jumped at me, you know, for, 
Some girls do, 6:c.

THEY ALL DO IT. 
Written and composed by JOHN READ. 
Arranged by H. W. Frrenarr. 
Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Some folks will cry " Oh ! shame, Mrs. Jones, you are to bigwig 
I 
never should have thought it, ma'am, of you," 
While, if they'd look at home before abroad they'd roam, 
I'm positive they'd have enough to do. 
Mrs. Brown says it's a 
sin, that Mrs. Smith drinks gin, 
And harbors " tally-men " from day to day; 
While Mrs. Green was caught doing what she hadn't ought, 
When she in self defencs was heard to say— 
CHORUS. 
" 
They all do it, they all do it, 
They all do it, though ofttimes they rue it; 
Yet they all do it, they all do it, 
And so it will continue to the end of the world!" 
For hours three or four, lovers spooning at the door, 
On any moonlight evening may be seen; 
Though if they want a 
lark, they have it in the dark, 
And they " do it," though they say " they didn't mean," 
When creeping down the stairs, comes the old man unaware4 
And kissing catch the couple in the act; 
The mother, from above, says " Don't interfere, my love, 
You can't dispute this most important fact—" 
They all do it,, etc.

Old women do declare, girls should never dye their hair, 
And then again they say it's very wrong; 
Without the least restraint, their faces so to paint, 
And rob the easy chair for their chignon. 
Each girl a 
little puff, has inside a 
little muff, 
They are never seen without it, night or day; 
And her pretty nose she'll powder, if a 
moment is allowed her, 
When, if you laugh, she'll innocently say— 
They all do it, etc, 
But what does most impress, is the style in which they dress, 
It's enough to make you laugh when them you see; 
They've a 
hat upon their heads, large enough to make up beds, 
For pussy cats with kittens two or three. 
In their panniers, too, behind, if examined you would find, 
The most important papers of the day; 
The Chronicle and Chimes, the Telegraph and Times, 
Or anything that chance puts in their way. 
They all do it, etc. 
r.ctere's my neighbor, Dinah Down, brught two lovely boys to 
. town, 
And her husband gets but one pound one per week; 
You often hear him say, " If things go on this way, 
We'll a 
lodging in the Union have to seek! 
For the doctor and the nurse, will drain my scanty purse, 
With many more expenses to defray;" 
Then he gets into a 
passion, when they tell him " it's th:?, 
fashion," 
And they soothe him as they sing this truthful lay— 
They all do it, etc.

Those pretty dove-like eyes 
That waft us to the skies, 
Then dashes us to mother earth again, 
With arms entwining fair, 
And bonnie silken hair— 
Alas, art thou the cause of all our pain ? 
TEMPTED. 
By }TARRY BURN'S 
I 
DREAM of angels bright, 
And wish to do the right— 
And many vows have taken o'er again. 
But some sweet fairy form 
Must wreck my soul with storm, 
And leave it wildly tossing on the main. 
The clouds then pass away 
And brightly beaming day 
Bids me to retrieve myself once more— 
But just as I 
would try 
Some satanical houri 
Drags me down still deeper than before. 
From the dread eternity 
My soul longs to be free— 
But the passions lead along with fearful sway, 
And Cupid's pleasing sin 
Still draws me back within 
And leaves me in dread terror and dismay. 
This world's our Paradise, 
With its virtue and its vice; 
We pluck the golden apples from the wall 
And find. ' ut ah, too late, 
Our consequential fate; 
That Venus is the cause of our downfall. 
Must I 
still wish in vain ? 
0, that I 
could restrain, 
Or dissolve this earthly dream of love, 
And live forevermore 
With one whom all adore 
In endless realms of Paradise above. 
Ah, now we reach the goal— 
And thee, poor passion soul, 
Thy guardian angel weeping, waits for thee, 
This temptress standing by 
Dare not to catch her eye 
Or doomed you'll be for all eternity.

The subject to-night of my song is love, 
Something quite heavy to bear; 
When that being you love to you provez, witrue, 
For none else in the world do you care. 
The lady I 
love is an angel divine, 
And with her my life I 
would share: 
But whene'er I 
go to her house her to see, 
There is always somebody there. 
SPOKEN.—I 
explained the matter to her the other evening, 
and when I 
had finished, she looked into my face this way, and 
said, that's nothing— 
CI101111S. 
There's always a 
seat in the parlor for you, 
No matter hew many are there; 
There's always a 
seat in the parlor for you, 
A 
sofa, a 
stool, or a 
chair. 
I 
went to her house one evening last wee, 
You may easily judge my surprise; 
I 
was just going to enter the hallway when 
I 
met that which opened my eyes. 
For there stood a 
man both tall and stout, 
Who said what do you wish here ? 
Grabbed me by the neck, threw me out on the walk, 
And the last words I 
could hear whilo there was--
68 
CuottnA. 
There's always a 
seat in the gutter for you, 
No matter how many are there; 
There's always a 
seat in the gutter for you, 
When you come around here have a 
care. 
Now the young men I 
go with all gave me the laugh, 
My troubles to them I 
have told; 
They say I 
am foolish to speak to her, 
Because I've been so often sold. 
No matter how often I 
have or may be, 
My love I 
shall never expel, 
I'll follow her, yes, both day and night, 
And my burdensome tale I 
will tell. 
SPoicEN.—Yes I 
shall haunt her day and night if its only to 
Ilear her say— 
CHORUS. 
There's always a 
seat in the parlor for you, 
No matter how many are there; 
There's always a

JUST A LITTLE TOO PAR. 
Written and Sung by BEN DODGE. 
I 
suppose you have noticed some folks are pecunar 
And never can they well enough let alone, 
But matters still push of results irregardless, 
Until every prospect completely has flown. 
Advice that is given they pass quite unheeded, 
They think they've been born 'neath some bright lucky star, 
Until when to the fact 1 
have named they awaken 
And find they have gone just a 
little too far. 
Now the big ferry line which leads over to Brooklyn 
Has adopted a 
scheme the newsboys to defeat, 
And also prevent them from retailing tickets, 
While honestly earning their bread in the street. 
The ferries are owned by a 
rich corporation; 
For the poor children's suffering they don't seem to care— 
The greater their wealth the more grasping their natures, 
But I 
think they have gone just a 
little too far. 
We've been bothered some time with an Excise Commission, 
Whose actions I 
think you'll pronounce very queer, 
They have strained every point to refuse dealers license 
And thus to deprive us of our Sunday beer. 
Our Teutonic friends they are greatly excited, 
And strongly they kick 'gainst the vile excise law, 
And express their opinions in terms very bitter— 
" 
Dose tam oxcise piznes.s vas gain' too far." 
Now there Henry Ward Beecher our most noted preacher, 
Who was foolish enough but last summer to say, 
That a 
poor laboring man should provide for his family 
Upon the small sum of a 
dollar a 
day, 
But if ever he practiced the doctrine he preaches, 
A 
great change would sure come to this divine star, 
And as he was feasting upon " bread and water" 
He'd find he had gone just a 
little too far. 
I 
suppose the old " Tammany Ring" is forgotten 
Which once ran New York in its own private way, 
But the justice adrninstered unto its leaders 
Has been badly mixed I 
am sorry to say; 
Genet, and Sweeney are taking things easy, 
With no chilling prospect their pleasures to mar, 
While generous old Bill Tweed is lying in prison. 
Now I 
think this has gone altogether too far. 
Last evening I 
got myself into a 
pickle, 
When my 'hearts dearest object I 
dropped in to seo. 
On the sofa together we were cozily sitting 
And I 
am afraid I 
was almost too free, 
For she sprang to her feet with her eyes fairly blazing, 
Said she " you just skip' or I'll call my papa." 
I 
tried hard to square it but she would'nt have it, 
She said " I 
had gone just a 
little too far."

Originally sung at Harrigan tit Hart's Theatre Comique, Broadway, 
by EDWIN BARRY. 
I 
lead a 
very homely life in a 
quiet sort of way, 
I 
like well to enjoy, and not feel over gay; 
Fast life does not agree with me at any time or place, 
I've traveled nearly through this world at quite a 
quiet pace. 
CHORUS. 
A 
quiet little home in a 
quiet little way, 
A 
quiet little wife sitting quiet all the day, 
A 
quiet little parlor, a 
quiet cup of tea, 
A 
life of peace and quietness, that's the life for me. 
I 
like to have my social sing, I 
like my pipe and glass, 
I 
love my wife, I 
love my friends with whom the time to pass; 
A 
reasonable hour to rest, an early hour to rise, 
'Twill make a 
man both healthy, wealthy, prosperous and wise. 
A 
quiet little home, &c. 
So now, my friends, take my advice, and do the best you can 
To earn a 
name that will become an honest working man; 
Study the comforts of your home, and very soon you'll find 
life of peace and quietness is best suited to the mind. 
A 
quiet little home, &c.

There's a 
maxim I 
can give, 
Simple, clear, and true, 
Teaching you the way to live, 
Showing what to do. 
Stand by this where'er you go, 
Wheresoe'er you dwell, 
Be your station high or low, 
" 
Do your duty well." 
CHORUS. 
If you would from care be free, 
Every grief dispel, ' 
Let your motto ever be 
" 
Do your duty well." 
If you rule yourself aright, 
If you persevere, 
You may make the future bright, 
Though the past be drear; 
Every man must play his part, 
Sorrow comes to all, 
But a 
light and cheerful heart 
Makes the trouble small. 
If you would, etc. 
Don't let envy fill your mind, 
If upon the road, 
You should meet a 
friend and find, 
Hi3 a 
lighter load. 
Though you have more hardly faired, 
Lessons you will l 
earn, 
Which will make you well prepared

HELP YOURSELF, 
MOTTO SON G. 
Music by E. D. Gomm. 
Words by .1. B. MURPHY. 
Help yourself, 
Never depend on the aid of another, 
li friend or acquaintance, or uncle or brother. 
Help yourself, 
Tough though the journey up hill—rough though it be by the 
way, 
Step by step, climb with a 
will—gain something every day 
CHORUS. 
Then never depend on another for aid, 
Work till a 
name and a 
station you've made, 
Struggle and strive and save your pelf, 
And, stick to the motto of help yourself. 
Help yourself, 
Tho' a 
friend in need is a 
friend indeed, 
Yet friends seldom help other friends to succeed. 
Help yourself, 
Blot the word fall from your book—make it the rule to succeed, 
Do it by hook or by crook, if honor but sanction the deed. 
Then never, & c. 
Help yourself. 
Thousands who do it succeed every day, 
Thousands who won't do it fall by the way. 
Help yourself, 
Strike the air line of success; keep it as long as you can, 
Use the word "will" tor "' guess," and be every inch of a 
man. 
LAST CHORUS. 
Then never depend on another for aid, 
If granted its got to be sometime repaid. 
Struggle and strive and you'll gain the pelf, 
With no one to thank that you helped yourself.

CHARLEY FLYNN, 
I 
ASK consideration, friends, 
And I 
wallet you know 
Why I'm saluted by the boys, 
Wherever I 
may go. 
I 
live in eighteen carat style, 
I 
drive a 
trotting mare, 
Smoke Flor-de-Grasshopper cigars, 
And scent my curly hair. 
SPOKEN.—And wherever I 
go, Broadway or any other place, 
you'll hear everybody say there goes: 
Charley Flynn! Charley Flynn! 
Wears the latest style of collars; 
Charley Flynn ! Charley Flynn! 
I 
am worth ten thousand dollars. 
And when I'm out to walk, 
My shirt's as white as chalk; 
The gang say, " Clear the way 
For there comes Charley Flynn! " 
I'm known in all the social clubs, 
I 
live on Zephyr stew, 
I 
pivot on a 
three- cent piece, 
And lance the dancers, too, 
And oftentimes I 
make a 
speech— 
Of course on politics; 
And sometimes, when I 
say too much, 
I 
get a 
shower of bricks. 
SPOKEN.—I 
will never make another speech as long as I 
live. 
I 
made a 
few remarks, at Hardly Able Hall, the other night, 
and didn't have two words out of my mouth before some one 
yelled out, " Cut his legs off! " 
The meeting broke up in a 
fight, 
and as I 
leaped through the door. they all cried: 
Charley Flynn I

merican Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is thesold-

published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
hese Cards are arranged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each of these into K for King, Q for Queen, 
and K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an, 
ewers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such P. way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by 
ntlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
s 
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
