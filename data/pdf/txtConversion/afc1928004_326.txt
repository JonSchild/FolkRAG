" 
OUR BOYS." 
By JOLLY Nesn. 
The Music of this song is published by Wm. A. POND & Co, 547 Broad-
way, New York, 
Price 40 cents. 
UNCLE Sam he was once at a 
festive affair, 
And they call'd upon Sarn for a 
strain; 
So he put out his weed and he toss'd off his glass, 
And then he commenc'd this refrain : 
I'll sing of " our boys," who have made a 
great name, 
There's Captain Borgardus, said he; 
In Europe he show'd them how well he could shoot, 
his equal we seldom shall see. 
CHORUS. 
He's one of " our boys," he is ! 
We're proud of .` our boys," we are; 
He's honest and true, so we give him his due, 
He's one of " our boys," hurrah! 
We've got a 
very good rifle team, 
They crossed the wide ocean you know; 
They defeated the Dollymount marksmen with ease, 
And brought off the prizes I 
vow; 
They've defeated since then the Canadian team, 
And although they don't make a 
great noise, 
They are open to meek any marksmen on earth, 
Gildersleeve and his bonny brave boys. 
CHORUS. 
They belong to " our boys," they do; 
We are proud of such boys, we are! 
They're honest and true, so we give them their due, 
They belong to " our boys," hurrah! 
When old Johnny Bull had Livingstone lost, 
And given him up in despair; 
It was one of " our boys," Jim Bennet, who said, 
" 
For the Doctor I'll now have a 
care" 
It was one of " our boys," and a 
plucky one, too, 
Who went out and Livingstone found ; 
AU honor to Stanley, may courage like his 
Be always successfully crowned. 
CHORUS. 
He's one of " our boys," he is, 
We are proud of such boys. we are! 
He's honest and true, so we give him his due, 
He's one of " our boys," hurrah! 
(1) 
" 
OUR BOYS.."—Concluded. 
But chief on the blazing scroll of fame 
Is one we shall never forget, 
He founded this nation, the pride of creation, 
And astonished J. Bull, you may bet; 
George Washington's name by all is revered, 
So fill up each cup and each can, 
And we'll make the roof ring whiPst we shout and we sing, 
For George was a 
mighty great man. 
CHORUS . 
He was chief of" our boys," he was, 
We are proud of such boys, we are 
He was honest and true, so we give him his due, 
He was chief of " our boys," hurrah! 
THE GRAY HAIRS OF MY MOTHER. 
Words by GEORGE COOPER. 
Music by T. BRIGHAM BISHOP. 
The Music of this song is published by A. E. Br-waxen, New 0*leans, 
La. 
Price 35 cents. 
THE gray hairs of my mother, 
This tress, this tress recalls them now; 
Again I 
see them cluster, 
in beauty, in beauty ' round her brow; 
Oh, tender are the mem'ries 
That wake from out the past; 
I 
live again life's morning, 
Too beautiful, too beautiful to last, oh! 
CHORUS. 
The gray hairs of my mother, 
This tress, this tress recalls them now ; 
Again I 
see them cluster 
In beauty, in beauty ' round her brow. 
Once more I 
kneel at twilight, 
In childhood's simple, earnest pray'r; 
Once more I 
see the homestead, 
And all, and all the blessings there; 
Oh, lovely tress of silver, 
Whatever cares may be, 
My heart, in all its trials, 
Is nearer heav'n, is nearer heav'n for thee, oh! 
The gray hairs, etc.

DUNDERBECK'S MACHINE. 
By ED. H ARRIGAN. 
A IR.—" Thomas's Machine." 
DERE was a 
good old German man, 
His name vas Dunderbeck, 
He vas very fond of poodle dogs 
Und sour krout nnd spec; 
He had a 
great big butcher shop, 
Der nicest ever seen, 
He got him out a 
patent, boys, 
To make sausages by steam. 
cuonus. 
Den oh, Mister Dunderbeck, 
How could you be so mean ? 
You vas sorry you invented 
Dat wonderful machine; 
Den pussy cats and long tail rats, 
No more dey will be seen, 
You grind dem up to sausage meat, 
By Dunderbeck's machine. 
be odder day a 
little boy 
He come into de store, 
He want a 
pound of head cheese 
Dat vas walking round de floor; 
Und while he was a- standing dere 
He whistled up a 
tune, 
Dem sausages begin to dance 
And jump around der room. 
Den oh, etc. 
Now something was der matter, 
Dat machine it wouldn't go, 
So Dunderbeck he crawled insite 
To find dat out, you know; 
His wife she took de niahtrilare, 
Und went walking in her sleep, 
She gave that crank one awful yank, 
Und Dunderbeck was meat. 
Den oh, etc. 
" OUR IRISH BOYS." 
As sung by SCANLAN and Caosix, with great success. 
21.1s.—" Our Boys." 
You may talk of " your boys," and your heroes of old 
By the powers, but the Irish can boast 
A 
long list of heroes, of Erin the pride, 
We number " our " Boys by the host; 
Saint Patrick the first on the list I 
will place, 
Then I'll name quite a 
lot great and small; 
From Brian Buru and the great Donag,al, 
To O'Connell, the pride of them all. 
CHORUS. 
He was one of Our Boys, he was! 
We are proud of Our Boys, we are; 
He was honest and true, so give him his due, 
He was one of" Our Boys," hurrah! 
To speak of the year ' 98 we don't fear, 
We had many brave boys then, I 
vow, 
And in ' 48, too, we bad heroes a 
few, 
With pride we remember them now; 
Robert Emmett, M'Manns, O'Brien, O'Neil, 
0 
Donavon Rossa, O'More; 
O'Connor, and Martin, and one more I'll name, 
John Mitchell, whose loss we deplore. 
He was, etc. 
Sam Lover and Moore, were Our Boys, to be sure. 
They were Irish. there's divil a 
doubt; 
Your soldiers are Irish, wherever they show 
They soon put their foemen to rout; 
In this land of the free, where we happen to be. 
We are modest and don't make a 
noise; 
But your generals, your statesmen, and all solid men, 
Belong to the ranks of Our Boys. 
CHORUS. 
They belong to Our Boys, they do! 
And we're proud of Our Boys, we are; 
If they're honest and true, we give them their due, 
We are proud of " Our Boys," hurrah !

SOLID DISHES TO THE FRONT. 
[Copyright, 185, by ROBERT M. 
DEWITT.] 
A SKETCH FOR THREE CHARACTERS. 
[Scene, a 
room. 
Enter HUNGRY JAKE and JIM.] 
HUNGRY JAKE. —I 
can't go any further on an empty stom-
ach. I 
haven't smelt of a 
square meal for the last six months. 
Free lunches on the island aint what they're cracked up to be. 
Oh, dear! I'm hollow. 
Jim.---Oh, come along. 
You're always growling. 
Why, it 
isn't three days yet since you had a 
peanut. 
HUNGRY JAKE.—I want something more nourishing. 
I 
would like to tackle a 
cow or an elephant. 
JIM. — Brace up. 
We can get a 
good square meal here if 
you only do as I 
say. 
This is the gentleman's house who ad-
vertised in this week's Clipper for two artists in the singing 
line. 
HUNGRY JAKE.—We look more in the Sing- Sing line. 
Oh, 
dear! if I 
only had the cover of a 
herring box, or an old India 
rubber shoe. 
JIM.—There you go again. 
Brace up, now, here comes the 
gentleman. 
[Enter MR. JOHNSON.] 
JIM.— Good morning, sir. 
HUNGRY JAKE.—Good morning. [Aside.] I 
hope he'll say 
" 
eat." 
Mn. JOHN-SON.—Good morning, gentlemen. 
You have 
called, I 
presume, about the advertisement. 
JIM. —.Yes; iny friend and myself have just left our cha-
teaux, and wish to accept of your situation merely for amuse-
ment, and more to pass away time than anything else. 
HUNGRY JAKE (
aside).—Just left our chateaux! 
That's the 
first time I 
ever heard the island called by that name before. 
M. JoirssoN.—Well, gentlemen, what is the style of your 
voices, bass or tenor? 
Or do you play ? 
HUNGRY JAKE (
aide).—I'd like to play with a 
knife and 
fork. 
JIM.—My friend here is just from the Conservatory a 
Paris, 
and is a 
tenor of very superior abilities.

I wish he'd say 
"

MR. JOEINSON.—And yourself? 
JIM.—Oh, I'm a 
bass. 
HUNGRY JAKE (
aside).—Base enough, for anything. 
MR. JOHNSON.—Well, gentlemen, if you will just sing a 
song or an aria, merely to show me the style of your respect-
ive voices, we will adjourn to the dining- room. 
HUNGRY JAKE (
leaning against Jim, aside).—Oh my, he 
said eat I It takes away my breath. 
Jim.—What composition shall we sing, sir ? 
JOHNSON.—Oh, suit yourself. 
Something from the old 
masters. 
Beethoven, Mozart, or anything classical. 
Jusr.—Humph! [Aside to HUNGRY JAKE.] 
Now, Jake, 
do your best. 
HUNGRY JAKF.—I can't sing on an empty stomach.

Lord! 
M R. JOHNSON.—All attention, gentlemen. 
[HUNGRY JAKE and Jrm strike attitudes, and with a 
great 
deal of preliminary mantxuvring they suddenly commence the 
song," Solid Dishes to the Front." MR. JOHNSON is horrified, 
and endeavors to stop them. 
Failing to do so he exits, and re-
turns with a 
policeman who claps handcuffs on them, and takes 
them of

Hash, hash, mysterious hashl 
In a 
second-class hotel you never miss hash; 
flash, hash, beautiful hash! 
It's a 
hard crowd to tackle, but easy to catch; 
I've travelled this country thro' and thro', 
This famous conundrum is always new; 
Talk of scrambled eggs, crumbs and crust, 
But mysterious hash is more robust; 
Reed-birds, quail, champagne and ice, 
Canary birds stuffed is all very nice— 
Cho. Hash, hash, mysterious hash I 
In a 
second-class hotel you never miss hash; 
Hash, hash, beautiful hash I 
It's a 
hail; crowd to tackle, but easy to catch, 
Cheese, cheese, Limburger cheese! 
Floating so gayly and sweet in the breeze; 
Cheese, cheese, Limburger cheese, 
Bring me a 
dish of sweet Limburger cheese ; 
At Miller's saloon I 
take my ease, 
And revel on lager and Limburger cheese; 
That's the luscious stuff to eat, 
For it makes your breath so sweet. 
Talk of love in Cupid's bowers, 
Talk of the balm of a 
thousand flowers— 
like. Cheese, cheese, Limburger cheese! 
Floating so gaily and sweet on the breeze; 
Cheese, cheese, Limburger cheese, 
Bring me a 
dish of sweet Limburger cheese.

AWFULLY LOOSE. 
Written by EDWIN T. PAGE. 
Composed by VINCENT DAVIES. 
Sung by G. H. MACDEEMOTT. 
Copyright, 1875, by G. H. liecnEnmoTT. 
[I hereby warn publishers against publishing this song, and shall prosecute 
any infringement on this copyright.) 
I'VE been dining and wining to-day, you can see, 
In a 
style that's deucedly loose; 
And to go on the spree now I 
know would suit me, 
For I 
mustn't go home, ' tis no use. 
So I 
do feel so gay—so reckless and gay, 
My spirits so lively and spruce, 
That I 
fancy that I 
shall go on the fly, 
For I 
do feel so awfully loose. 
SPOKEN.—The fact is I've had a 
jolly good row with the 
Missus, and I 
feel rather excited, not tight, you know, but— 
CHORUS. 
I 
do feel so awfully loose—so loose! 
I 
do feel so awfully loose; 
I 
fancy that I 
shall go on the fly, 
For I 
do feel so awfully loose. 
I 
was walking and talking along Broadway, 
As I 
felt so uncommonly loose; 
While laughing and chaffing with every belle, 
The excitement must be my excuse. 
All at once I 
descried a 
girl by my side, 
My heart went pit- pat like the deuce; 
I 
could not see her face, but her style and her grace 
Soon made me feel awfully loose. 
SPOKEN.—There was something familiar about her, but she 
was closely veiled. 
My curiosity was aroused; I 
determined 
to know her, regardless of consequences, for—

AWFULLY LOOSE.—Concluded. 
CHORUS. 
I 
did feel so awfully loose—so loose! 
I 
did feel so awfully loose ; 
I 
fancied that she would exactly suit me, 
For I 
did feel so awfully loose. 
To woo and to coo I 
embraced every chance, 
In a 
style that was dreadfully loose; 
I 
pressed her to go to the Argyle to dance, 
And really would take no excuse. 
I 
vowed ' twould be bliss if she'd grant me a 
kiss, 
And to raise her veil tried to induce; 
" 
What is this !' 
on my life! 
r 
d 
been courting my tezfe! 
Oh, I 
did feel so awfully loose! 
SPOKEN.— Yes, it was the Missus. She knew I 
was dining out; 
disguised herself, and had watched all my little goings on. She 
looked at me in her own peculiar way, and as she looked at 
In e— 
CHORUS. 
I did feel so awfully loose—so loose I 
I 
did feel so awfully loose; 
'Twas all up with me, I 
could easily see, 
Oh, I 
did feel so awfully loose! 
What she said and what / said, may be easily guessed, 
For we both felt remarkably loose; 
The dispute grew so warm that I 
thought ' twould be best 
To leave her, by way of a 
truce. 
So I 
left her behind, and comfort I 
find 
In imbibing the generous juice; 
I 
shall get it hot, but I 
do:i't care a 
jot, 
For to- night I 
am out, on the loose. 
SPOKEN.—" Oh, wait till I 
get you home !" she said. 
So I 
think the best way to avoid a 
curtain lecture is to avoid going 
home; so I 
mean to make a 
night of it. 
For— 
I 
do feel so awfully loose, etc.

THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG. 
• One of TONT PASTOR'S Most Popular Comic Songs. 
There's a 
dashing young clerk, here let me remark, 
his &Wry is ten dollars a 
week; 
Yet he dresses in style, wears an elegant tile, 
And to keep up appearance will seek. 
Then at night, let me say, he at keno will play, 
With the boys around town go it strong, 
And the money flies fast, but he's found out at last, 
And discovers that's where he was wrong, 
Yes, be finds out that's where he was wrong. 
As you go through the street, you are certain to meet 
Some gift enterprise jewelry store. 
"Heaps of Tines each day here are given ,away," 
You arc told by a 
man at the door. 
You go in with the rest, your cash you invest, 
r111111 gold watches are had for a 
song. 
When your money you've sank, find each drawing a 
blank, 
And it strikes you that's where you were wrong, 
Yes, it strikes you that's where you were wrong. 
Just to pass time away, into court Cother day 
I 
rambled and took a 
seat. 
- 
A poor girl had to sue, for the money was due, 
A slop-clothing man from Chatham street. 
Says the fellow " I'm bent I 
will not pay a 
cent, 
Dough she sues me for ever so long." 
Saws Judge Dowling, " Just so. 
W ell, t
o 
prison you 
go, 
r
.ro convince you that's where you are wrong, 
Yes, I'll show you that's where you are wrong." 
Ninety-four years ago, as, of course, you all know, 
King George o'er these colonies reigned, 
Bit the Yankees aw oke, 
an d 
their shackles they broke— 
Our liberty Washington gained. 
John Bull, o'er the main boldly ventured again, 
But he found out Columbia was strong. 
Andrew Jackson they met, and they'll never forget 
how he showed them that's were they were wrong, 
Yes, he showed them that's where they were wrong. 
It's a 
pleasure to me, your kind faces to see, 
Brightly beaming each evening around, 
While here on the stage, I 
am bound to engage, 
Every novelty that's to be found. 
'We'll all do our best, and myself 'mong the rest, 
Always happy to sing you a 
song; 
But if you think it's right, here to keep me all night, 
I 
can tell you that's where you are wrong.

THAT'S WHERE WE BOTH GRAB GROUND. 
By NED HARRIGAN, for W ALTERS and Mearon. 
W E'RE a 
loose and careless pair of nigs, 
We're honey from the comb, 
We twist our legs in reel or jig, 
And dislocate the bone. 
Our understandings are immense, 
Just listen to the sound, 
We've got a 
heap of common sense, 
That's where we both grab ground. 
CHORUS. 
So watch this curlicue, (Symph.) 
Oh, ain't it fun for you, (
Symph.) 
For with a 
bound we bounce around, 
That's where we both grab ground. 
The peculiar vibrations 
That's just below the knee, 
Causes a 
sensation 
Which creates a-jility, 
It raises dust and makes a 
noise, 
And lays things loose around, 
Here's what knocks—electric shocks, 
That's where we both grab ground. 
So watch this, etc. 
To our lady friends we did intend 
To say a 
word or two, 
If nothing more than au-revoir, 
Or girls, how do you do ? 
But we know they will excuse us, 
And won't give us a 
frown; 
For among the dears we have no fears 
Of losing any ground. 
So watch this, etc.

MY OLD FRIEND JOHN. 
[Copyright, 1876, by ROBERT M. DEWrrr.] 
A SKETCH FOR TWO CHARACTERS. 
Enter JOHN, an old man. [ The symphony of song is played.] 
and then enter in an opposizte direction, JOE, an old man. 
JOHN. — Well, well, as I 
live it's my old friend and crony, Joe I 
well, well. 
JOE. — 
Is that you, John ? Why it can't be that you are in 
the land of the living. 
JOHN.— Well, if I'm not, at any rate I'm a 
pretty lively sort 
of ghost, ain't I, Joe ? 
Give us your fist. 
Ha! ha! 
JOE.— Glad indeed to see you, old friend John! 
JoHN.—Glad to see you, old friend Joe! [They shake hands 
cordially.] 
JOE. — Why, let me see, its a 
long while since we've met, and 
we're both very near to the bottom of the bill, hey, John ? 
JOHN.—Aye, aye: but barrin' a 
little bit of rheumatiz, these 
old legs of mine are good for many a 
mile yet. 
JOE. — Yes, yes; why, we're as good as the best of 'em: al-
though the snow is falling on our heads, there's plenty of 
warmth beneath. 
Ha! ha I 
JOHN. — And then what good old times we've had, hey, Joe ? 
Do you remember the rosy-cheeked girls we've kissed in our 
youth ? 
JOE. — Do I ? 
Shall I 
ever forget 'em ? 
JOHN.—And the jolly meeting with our companions! 
JOE. — And the bouts we've had over our punch! 
JOHN. —And the picnics! 
JOE.—And the songs we've sang. 
JOH-
N. — Ha! ha! 
ha! 
[Suddenly checks hims4f, and holds 
his side as if in pain.] 
JOE.—Ho! 
ho! 
ho! 
[Suddenly puts his hand to his 
back.] 
The symphony is played very softly. 
John and Joe clasp 
hands, and each in turn sing a 
verse of the song, both joining 
in the chorus. 
Evit at the conclusion, singing the chorus.

Our friendship has been true, 
In all the weal and woe of life, 
No change that friendship knew. 
We've miss'd some lov'd ones, one by one, 
And twin'd our wreaths of heather, 
In fancy as we've deck'd their tombs, 
Since we were boys together. 
Both. 
Since we were boys, merry, merry boys, 
Since we were boys together, 
Unalter'd is our friendship, Joe. (or John.) 
Since we were boys together. 
Joe.—I 
need not bid thee ponder, John, 
You know our prime is o'er: 
The flow'r, the nest, the humming-bee, 
For us will charm no more, 
And our frail forms are fading fast, 
We could not bound the heather, 
As hand in hand with gladsome brows, 
We did when boys together. 
Both. 
'
When we were boys, merry, merry boys, 
When we were boys together, 
Through many sunny years, friend John, (or Joe.) 
May we yet live together.

IRISH CASTLES IN THE AIR. 
Sung by BILLY ASHCROFT. 
THIS world is all a 
bubble, no matter where we go, 
There nothing here but trouble, hardships, toil, and woe; 
Go where we will, do what we may, we are never free from care, 
And at the best this world is but a 
castle in the air. 
And yet each being loves the land where he sported as a 
child, 
The savage loves his native plain, his woods and praries wild, 
And I 
with a 
true Irish heaTt still wish in Ireland there, 
To sit amongst her groves and build my castles in the air. 
Old Ireland had her poet, she loved him I 
am sure, 
lie was a 
true born Irishman, his name ' twas Tom Moore, 
But of this world's sorrows we know he had his share, 
For Moore was always building his castles in the air. 
He sang the rights of Ireland, he sang against her wrongs, 
And many loving Irish hearts, they cherish yet his songs. 
He made the Irish heart rejoice, he bade them ne'er despair, 
And for Ireland in the future he built castles in the air. 
We boast of Dan O'Connell too, who struggled bard and sure 
To bring both peace and happiness to dear old Erin's shore, 
.And though his efforts were in vain, the spirit still was there; 
For Dan still struggled on, and built his castles in the air, 
And though he's dead and gone, we find both old and young 
Will often quote the wit that flowed from Dan O'Connell tongue. 
The widow and the fatherless their sorrows he would share, 
And build for them in days to come bright castles in the air. 
Ould Ireland had her statesmen, and artists many one, 
Her sculptures and her generals who noble deeds have done; 
Besides she boasts of Goldsmith with talents rich and rare, 
Whose standard works make thousands build their castle in 
the air; 
Her mountain lakes and valleys are lovely to behold, 
• 
Her daughters they are bright and fair, her sons are brave and 
bold; 
No other country where I've been to me seems half so fair, 
It's the land where I 
in childhood built my castles in the air. 
ASHANTEE RECRUITS. 
Ain.—" N. G. S. N. Y." 
BEHOLD before you warriors bold, 
And soldiers who rank high, 
Two privates, yes, privates 
In the N. G. S. N. Y. 
War wrinkled attracts us (me) not, 
To it we seldom fly; 
'Tis safer far to play at war 
In the N. G. S. N. Y. 
CITORUS. 
We're warriors bold in the N. G. S. N. Y., 
We're soldiers bold, 
To the wars we never fly, 
With our gay martial air, 
That attracts all the fair, 
In the N. G. S. N. Y. 
What splendid chaps the ladies say, 
As we go marching by; 
The corps par excellence are we 
In the N. G. S. N. Y. 
Our foes all tremble as they read 
Our motto, " Never say die," 
Which little phrase we understand 
In the N. G. S. N. Y. 
We're warriors, etc.

TEMPERANCE SPEECH. 
A BURLESQUE ON JOHN B. 
GOUOU'S SrEECR. 
Delivered by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
I 
vita, now make a 
few remarks on demperance. I 
am no 
drinking man, never having drank a 
drop of liquor in my life— 
dot I 
paid for. 
I 
am no orator, but shall try to represend dot 
gread demperance orator, John B. Gough, a 
man whom I've 
ofden been daken for. 
Should I 
possess de eloquence of Gen-
eral Grant, I 
could give more scope to de subject I 
am now 
aboud to wrestle mit. 
Demperance is an old und veil worn subject, but like a 
Keno 
box ve can shake it ub, und get anoder number. 
Id's very hard to approach a 
man vat aind a 
drinking; you're 
apt to be met with—" Who tole you I 
wasn't drinking ?"— 
" 
You mind your business, und I'll mind yours."— " 
Come und 
take a 
ball." 
Und oder veil-known expressions used by poli-
ticians. 
I 
was called upon vonce to see Tone of de hardest cases of 
demperance it has ever been my good fortune to witness. 
A 
man, who ven drunk vos de kindest of husbands; but yen 
sober he vos a 
perfect devil. 
I 
vent to de house, a 
beautiful 
brown curb- stone front, knocked de door down, und vent in. 
De man vos dere. 
I 
said to him— " 
Viii you please give me a 
drink of vater 1"—(de firsd dime I 
ever dook vater in my life). 
Ile said—" Yes, sir; have a 
seat," pointing to a 
red-hot sdove. 
I 
declined to sit, for various reasons. I 
spoke to him aboud 
Infladion, Seven Oud, but I 
avoided the subjecd of demper-
ance. 
At last I 
said, " You have a 
wife, I 
believe ?" he replied, 
" 
Yes, sir, de fifth one ; red-headed." I 
said, " You love your 
wife, don't you 7" 
He said, " Yell, id's unnatural to love a 
vife 
now-a-days." I 
said, " Don'd you dink of you would sign dis

He said, " Yes ; I 
suppose so." 
I 
said, " You'll do 
id 7" 
He said, " I 
vill." I 
pulled oud a 
coby of " Good- Look-
ing Snow," I 
laid id on de dable; he placed his nose in de ink-
bottle, und wrote his name. 
Just den a 
voice came from anoder room—(full of emodion 
und beer)—" Luke Gerloot !"—de man said—" Come in mit 
me, Mr.Whooping-cough." I 
vent in dere, und his vile vos lay-
ing on a 
bed, she vos dead—drunk; he knelt down und printed 
a 
kiss on her forehead in large type. 
She took his foot in her 
hand, looked up, und said—" Oh! Luke is such a good hus-
band ven he's drunk, but yen sober, he's N. G !" , de first time 
I 
ever knew she spoke Latin). 
De man said— " 
She says I'm 
good !"—at de same time pulling down de neck of his shirt, he 
showed me a 
second-hand scar. I 
said, " Vere you vaccinated 
dere 3" 
His vile said, " I 
cannot tell a 
lie, I 
done it mit a 
lit-
tle hatchet." 
Of my lips had been dry yen I

STEADY COMPANY. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
By NED. HARRIGAN. 
Os! ain't it nice on Wednesday eve, 
The time when lovers meet, 
To have your girl lean on your arm, 
Oh, my! ain't it a 
treat! 
Just once a 
week a 
call I 
make, 
To see my little one, 
She's just as sweet to me as cake 
Or a 
dainty sugar plum. 
CHO BUS. 
I 
am keeping steady, steady company, 
Where there is lots of fun, yes, lots of fun for me; 
I 
visit Jane on Wednesday eve, 
Just when the clock strikes nine. 
Now, really, folks, I 
do believe 
Some day she will be mine; 
Her folks have no objection 
To my calling at the house, 
For I'm high in their affections, 
Just as innocent as a 
mouse. 
Jane blushes, too, all over her face, 
When I 
kiss her at the door, 
In all her blush and smile I 
trace, 
A 
lingering wish for more. 
I 
am keeping, etc. 
Now, young men, all just bear in mind, 
Same charmer you must get; 
Some nice young damsel you must find, 
That you can call your pet. 
And call on her just once a 
week, 
You can do it if you try, 
With kisses one another greet, 
The same as Jane and I. 
I 
am keeping, etc. 
THE PRIZE PACKAGE 
AN. 
Written by GEORGE W . 
OSBORN. 
Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
I 
saw him on the corner, 
Of Broadway and Chambers street; 
And all the people !locked around 
To hear his voice so sweet. 
To buy his candy packages 
The men and women ran; 
There's a 
prize in every package 
Says the prize package man. 
So jump up, and get up, any way you can, 
There's a 
prize in every package, says the prize package 
man. 
He was a 
gallus fellow, 
And he wore a 
big moustache ; 
He'd sing a 
song, anti crack a 
joke, 
Which some might think was rash ; 
But still they gathered round him 
As soon as he began, 
And all the ladies doted on 
This prize package man. 
Now jump up. and get up, any way you can, 
There's a 
prize in every package, says the prize package 
man. 
I 
saw my Angelina 
Standing in the crowd; 
The package man he smiled on her, 
And then she winked and bowed. 
Imitate 
And when she took_ a 
package, 
crying. S 
I 
saw him squeeze her hand; 
There's a 
prize in every package 
Says the pi ize package man. 
So jump up, and get up, any way you can, 
There's a 
prize in every package, says the prize package 
man. 
I 
called on Angelina 
The evening of that day; 
Imitate t And it almost broke my heart to hear 
crying. 
That she had run away. 
A billy-dux to my address 
Was left upon the stand ; 
Saying she had skedaddled 
With the prize package man. 
Now if I 
catch the rascal, 
bust him if 1 
can, 
And ril scatter all the prizes of the prize package man; 
I'll jump up, and get up, any way I 
can, 
And I'll dislocate the bugle of tlrat prize package man.

I THINK IT LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE IT. 
As sung by Toril PAsTOB., 
Angelina Petroleum I 
love, 
And have for a 
very long time, 
Tho' I 
never bad courage to tell her, 
So wrote down my feelings im rhyme. 
I've to meet her to-night in the Park, 
And while the iron's hot I 
will strike it: 
She never acknowledged she loved me, 
But I 
think it looks very much like it, 
Yes, I 
think it looks very much like it. 
Her hair falls in curls down her back, 
And when at me she looks with her eyes, 
In that sort of way you all know— 
Then drops them again, and then sighs. 
Her cheek looks so beautifully plump 
That sometimes I 
think I 
could bite it, 
But that I'm afraid she'd object to, 
At least I 
don't think she'd much like it, 
Yes, at least I 
don't think she'd mu h 
like it. 
One night 1 
went to her 
house, 
Intending to take her a 
walk; 
When I 
saw An-elLia with a 
stranger, 
Having a 
nice little talk; 
I 
was in such a 
rage at the time, 
With my cane I 
thought I 
should strike him; 
She afterwards said 'twas her brother, 
But I 
told her she wasn't much like him. 
Yes, I 
told her she wasn't much like him. 
[11 
THINK IT LOOKS,AC.—rionownsp. 
I 
seriously spoke to her after, 
For at that time I 
seriously thought 
If she didn't quite know what was right, 
I 
said she ought to be taught, 
She said she ne'er meant to deceive me, 
And if aught was wrong she would right it 
I 
don't think she tried to humbug me, 
But I 
think it looks very much like it. 
Yes, I 
think it looks very much like it. 
One thing about her I 
don't like, 
That is, that she often will smoke, 
And when I 
speak to her about it, 
She says it's done for a 
joke. 
From my case she last night tf)ok a 
weed, 
And she knew the right way, too, to light it; 
don't say she's given to smoking, 
But I 
think it 1
,,oks very much like it. 
Yes, I 
think it looks very much like it. 
By Jove, tho', I 
must go at once, 
Or I'm certain that I 
shall be late, 
For if I'm not there in my time, 
Angelina will be in such a 
state. 
For the kindness which you've shown to me 
I'll do my utmost to requite it; 
I 
don't say you're going to applaud me, 
But I 
think it looks very much like it. 
Yes, I 
think it looks very much like it. ,

THE SNOOZE. 
Written for ED. FRENCH by ED. HAB.RIGA24 
THERE'S a 
fellow who lives in this city, 
And he sleeps on the floor of saloons; 
He lives on birdseed and crackers, 
And his business is juggling spittoons; 
He's known by every barkeeper, 
As a 
bum be is the worst of th-nt all; 
You bet he never would tumble, 
The ham with the terrible gall, 
GEWRITS. 
They say he is a 
horrible snoozer, 
And a 
boozer, what a 
rooster; 
When he borrows your money you're loser, 
The snoozer with the terrible gall. 
He has got an eye in his bead like a 
mackerel, 
And his neck is as long as a 
crane; 
He eats gruel that is made out of sawdust, 
Mixed up with a 
seven days' rain ; 
His clothes would cover a 
hair-pin— 
Shoot him with a 
big cannon ball; 
You bet that he never would drop— • 
The bum with the terrible gall. 
They say, et€.

way, New York. Price 35 Cents. 
In life we find some funny folks, 
Whose ways are very strange, 
But as you journey through the world, 
Of course we like a 
change ; 
People of true metal are 
A 
scarcity, but then 
We know their value when we deal, 
With Silver plated men. 
Then always be straight-forward, boys, 
Let your motto read, 
Remember when you want a 
friend, 
A 
friend's a 
friend indeed ; 
Act on the square to every one, 
They'll all speak of you then, 
As not belonging to the class, 
Called Silver plated men. 
When driven by adversity, 
And fortune leaves your side, 
'Tis then you need a 
helping hand, 
The troubled sea to ride ; 
You soon find out the sunshine friends, 
For what's your cares to them, 
They promise much and nothing do; 
They're Silver plated men. 
Then always be, &e. 
A man's like gold or silver, and 
The way to try him best, 
Is Judge not by appearances, 
But put him to the test; 
You'll soon find out what he is worth, 
You'll know him surely then, 
If he's true metal, he is worth, 
A. hundred plated men 
Then always be, ate.

When first I 
met the firm of Green, 
'Twas on my journey down 
To spend a 
day at Rosherville, 
" 
Just like a 
swell from town." 
The Widow loved romantic scenes, 
And a 
squeeze on the sly: 
But when my arm went round her waist, 
The boy began to cry! 
SroxEs.—He declared I 
was hurting his Hamma, and would 
insist upon sitting between its, only fancy making love to a 
girl with a 
boy in the way, but, she said to him in a 
voice so sweet 
eno.—Tommy, make room for your Uncle, &-c. 
3 
The mother told her loving son 
To watch the passing train, 
" 
But no," he said, " my Uncle Fred" 
Will kiss your hand again. 
The Widow blushed, a 
maiden blush, 
And I 
was not myself; 
For who could make love on a 
seat, 
In front of that young Elf? 
SPOKEN.-- Yes, it would never do to make lore before the boy, and 
the Widow said—" IVot before the Loy. Fred not before the boy; just 
then we went under a 
tunnel. and she said: 
CEO.—Tommy, make room ! or yo ni Uncle, &c.

In a 
snug retreat at Rosherville, 
I 
went down on ray knees, 
And asked if she would fly with me 
Across the bright blue seas. 
She sighed, and said " You wicked man, 
But how about the child ?" 
And clasped him fondly to her breast, 
While I 
the agony piled! 
SPORF:N.—I 
said," .3fy lovely of all lovely beinge, let us fly to some 
foreign 
clime, where I 
will protect you and your boy." 
She answered, 
and said, " How about my little pie shop in Seven Dials" " Oh 
Bloomsbury I 
do you keep a 
pie shop 1"

TOM MY, 
MAR-F. ROOM FOR YOUR AUNTIE. 
Am.—" Tommy, Make Room for Your Uncle." 
As sung by Miss JENNIE Etconss. 
Now Miss Fitzwilliam of Union Square 
Presents herself to you, 
And you may guess, when she is dressed, 
Of gents she knows a 
few ; 
A 
widower fell in love with me 
While riding in a 
train ; 
He had his little boy with him, 
Who caused us both much pain. 
SPOKEN. —
Yes, the confounded young urchin caused me ft great 
deal of pain and sorrow, and the widower, his father, introduced 
me to the little boy as his auntie, and during the whole of the jour-
ney the father had to say— 
CHORUS. 
Tommy, make room for your auntie, 
There's a 
little dear ; 
Tommy, make room for your auntie, 
I 
want her to sit here ; 
You know papa has got a 
cake, 
And that he'll give to you ; 
So don't annoy, there's a 
good boy, 
Make room for your auntie, do. 
When first I 
met this widower, 
'Twas on the journey down 
To spend a 
day at Long Branch, 
Just like a 
swell from town; 
The widower loved romantic scenes, 
And a 
squeeze on the sly; 
But when his arm went round my waist 
The boy began to cry. 
SPOREN.—He declared his papa was hurting me, and would in-
sist upon sitting between us; only fancy making love to a 
girl 
with a 
little boy in the way; but his father said to him in a 
voice 
so sweet— 
Tommy, make room, etc. 
The father told his loving son 
To watch the passing train ; 
But no, he said, my dear papa, 
You'll kiss that lady again ; 
Of course I 
blushed a 
maiden blush, 
And he was not himself; 
For who could make love in a 
car, 
In front of that young elf? 
STORM— Yes, it would never do to make love before the boy, 
and when the widower pressed me I 
said " Not before the boy, sir 
—not before the boy "— just then we went under a 
tunnel, and— 
Tommy, make room, etc. 
CENTENNIAL SONG. 
ORIGINAL. 
Written and sung by BEN MAGINLEY. 
Ain.—" Ten Thousand Miles Away." 
W HAT a 
great and glorious land this is, 
And how we've walked along 
since a 
hundred years ago to-day, 
When we sang that good old song 
Of Yankee Doodle, right side up, 
And felt ourselves 0 K—ay—ay— ay, 
When Johnny Bull skedaddled home, 
Ten thousand miles away ? 
CHORUS . 
Then blow ye winds, heigbo, 
And a 
roaming I 
will go; 
I'll stay no more on my native shore, 
But let the music play—ay—ay. 
I'm off by the morning train, 
To see my love again— 
Pm.off to my love, with a 
boxing- glove, 
Ten thousand miles away. 
Bince a 
hundred years ago, my boys, 
The ladies, bless their souls, 
Are wearing striped stockings now, 
And look like barber-poles 1 
And they get their lovely pull- backs on, 
And don't they look so gay—ay—ay ; 
Then they look like swells in tight-legged pants, 
From ten thousand miles away. 
Then blow, etc. 
Next summer when the circus comes 
We'll have a 
new show here; 
For Theodore Tilton is engaged 
To walk upon hi 
ear; 
We'll have Bristow doing a 
bare-back act, 
And all dressed up so gay— ay—ay, 
And Beecher'll dance the can- can, 
From ten thousand miles away. 
Then blow, etc. 
But lay all follies by, my friends, 
Great wonders we have done, 
And may America still grow great 
For a 
thousand years to come; 
So, I'll bid you all good-bye, my friends, 
I 
got a 
brand new job to-day—ay—ay, 
To go chewing glue in Kalamazoo, 
Ten thousand miles away. 
Then blow, etc.

PAT MALONY'S FAMILY. 
Written and sung by ED. HARRIGAN in HARRIGAN & HART's sketch, 
" 
Who owns the Line l" 
Ma name is Mike Malony, 
I'm a 
carpenter by trade; 
I 
married Molly Higgins, 
Who all my trouble made. 
She'd as many of relations 
As fishes in the sea; 
They ate me out of house and home, 
And destroyed my family. 
CHORUS. 
There's her father, 
And her mother, 
And her sister, 
And her brother-
1700 babies laying on their knees. 
Her uncles and her cousins, 
And aunties by the dozens, 
Lived upon the earnings of Patrick MalonT. 
My pants would fit her uncle, 
Her dress would fit her niece; 
I 
have to sleep upon the roof, 
Or I 
never have no peace. 
They made me buy them dainties, 
Root-beer by the pail; 
I'd have to wait till they were full 
Before I'd git me male. 
CHORUS. 
There was pudding, 
There was mutton 
That would make you bust a 
button, 
And a 
fiery-headed Corkonian, 
By the name of Pat Cloney, 
To superintend the table, 
To put me in the stable, 
While they ate up all the labor of Patrick Malony. 
(1) 
PAT MALONY'S FAMILY.—Concludedi 
Her uncle wore my stockings, 
My hat would fit his head; 
When tired out wid labor, 
They'd kick me out of bed. 
I 
put up every pinny 
For to keep them from Bellevue; 
I 
wish the coroner would sit 
On my wife and all her crew. 
CHORUS. 
There's her nephews 
And her nieces, 
That come from several places; 
1700 grandmothers 
And tnothers-in-law you see; 
A 
wagon load of Dalys ; 
McSweegan and the Halys 
Lived on the earnings of Patrick Malony; 
There's her second cousin's brother, 
And his toothless old step- mother, 
And 1600 emigrants from Ireland you see, 
Wid their boxes and their bedding, 
On my ingrain carpet treading, 
They lived upon the earnings of Patrick Malony. 
CHORUS. 
There's the Bradys 
And the Gradys— 
Dacent, perfect ladies, 
Always axing charity 
From my family you see. 
One husband was a 
loafer, 
The other was a 
toper, 
Depending on the friendship of Patrick Maiony.

I'M HERE AGAIN TO GREET YOU ALL. 
As Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
I'm here again to greet von all, 
To please yon I 
must sing, sirs, 
And now I've got another song. 
You'll find is just the thing, sirs; 
The suoject is a 
common one, 
it's the last and best sensation. • 
So if you listen I 
will tell, 
Of a 
terriide temptation. 
Yes. I'll engage it's all the rage, 
This terrible temptation. 
A gay young clerk he falls in love, 
The sensation it is so funny, 
Be presents makes of diamond rings, 
Gold watches chains and money, 
ills salary is quite small you know, 
But he's got a 
situation. 
Where he helps himself to all he wants, 
For this terrible temptation. 
But soon he's caught, that ends his pot, 
'Tis this terrible temptation. 
A man gets married, settles down, 
Resolves to live quite steady, 
Re stays at home, quite temperate lives, 
No more for sprees he's ready. 
In a 
little while 
meets a 
friend. 
Takes a 
drink for rocreation, 
He staggers home drunk as a 
lord, 
Ks a 
terrible temptation. 
Ile says, dear wife, joy of' my life, 
it's a 
terrible temptation. 
One day while walking round the town, 
A fellow less than human, 
Insulted on the public street, 
A weak, defenceless woman. 
I 
quickly put a " head " on him, 
Gave his eye an elevation, 
I 
kicked him where his coat tails hang„ 
'Twos a 
terrible temptation. 
For woman's rights 
always fight, 
'Tis a 
terrible temptation. 
A 
bachelor old and crusty grown, 
For beauty has no eye. sir, 
Declares be bates all woman kind, 
sinole live and fIe. sir 
lint let a 
young. bewitching- elf. 
Try her powers ef fascination. 
Spoken.— Ire's gone. Well, you know how it is yourself. 
'Tin a

The first on the page is little Sally Sage, 
She once was a 
lady's maid; 
But she ran away on a 
very dark day, 
With a 
fellow in the fried fish trade. 
The next was a 
Cook, oh! a 
beauty with a 
hook, 
And I'll tell you the reason why! 
For a 
leg she'd a 
stump, on her back was a 
hump, 
And she'd got a 
little squint in her eye !—Cno. 
3 
Another one to charm was a 
Girl on a 
farm, 
Well versed in the harrows and ploughs; 
She guarded the rigs of a 
lot of little pigs, 
And squeezed new milk from the Cows. 
She was sixteen stone all muscle and bone, 
And she looked with an awful leer; 
And she would have been mine, but fell in a 
decline 
Thro' swallowing a 
mouse in her beer !— Clio. 
4 
Then another one came, ah, a 
right jolly Dame, 
And her purse was as long as my arm, 
All full of yellow gold, such a 
sight to behold! 
Would the heart of a 
miser warm. 
And her only sin was a 
love for gin, 
But it brought our hopes to a 
wreck; 
For she slipp'd with her heel on a 
bit of orange peel, 
Fell down and broke her blessed neck.— CHO. 
5 
I 
could add to the score full a 
half dozen more, 
For the list is a 
long way round; 
One went o'er the sea for a 
better chap than me, 
And some of them were hanged or drowned. 
And the last I 
had through drink went mad, 
In vain I 
tried to stop her: 
And sad was my dismay to discover that one day, 
She'd been slowly boiled to death in the Copper.

I'LL STAND SAM, 
FOR TO- DAY I'M TWENTY-ONE. 
I'm not a 
man who cares for cash, 
I 
like what cash will nu ; 
And when I'm out I 
cut a 
dash, 
There's few more free than I. 
Some fellows want to Tommy Dodd, 
And all that kind o' sham, 
No " odd man out" for me, my boys, 
I'd rather stand for nni. 
Spoken. 
None of you Tommy Dodd for me, the " 0(101 
man's" quite out of my good books, and as Fm not qui 0 
such a 
Sam as to be done out of glasses round to folks I 
don't care about, by Jove, l'll stand Sam to those I 
do. 
CII0I:US. 
So come along, boys, I'll stand Sam, 
I'll stand Sam, I'll stand Sam, 
With glasses round or bottles o' cham, 
To-day I'm twenty-one. 
Let other fellows hoard their gold, 
My coin was made to spend ; 
And as I've plenty, I 
contrive 
My quantum to expend. • 
And while with friends who're well-to-do 
I 
poverty may sham, 
But yet I 
never meet a 
poorer pal 
But what I 
will stand Sam. 
Spoken. 
Mind, I 
like to go to Yorkshire and pay in my 
turn, that's when I'm out with pals as well off as myself, 
but when I'm out with a 
poorer pal I 
don't let him pay. 
I 
say : 
Conic along, &c. 
I've started several Yankee themes, 
And then, I 
must confess, 
I've always found it requisite 
To stand %veil with the press; 
No matter if I 
wrote a 
play 
Or just laid down a 
tram, 
If good, the press would praise it up, 
And I, of course, stood Sam. 
Spoken. 
Take my advice, my boys, and stand Sam oe-
eassionally ; you'll feel all the better for it. 
It's more gen-
erous than tossing, and not so risky, as I 
see our noble 
army of blues have orders to take away any one into cus-
tody found gambling in any way, so follow my example, 
say: 
Come along, &e. 
I 
think, though, I 
shall soon lay by, 
And settle down in life; 
When Ma'inselle Right but takes my eye 
Then I 
shall take a 
wife ; 
And at our wedding party, you 
Shall all partake of Cham ; 
For on that great, occasion I'll 
Most handsomely stand Sam. 
Spoken. 
Stand Sam—I 
should say so—fancy going with 
Jemina to 
the palace at 
Sydenliam. 
Fare there and 
back, inclusive of cabs and busses— and lunch, two dinners 
and a 
tea, bitter beer and ices. swings and extra shows, 
altogether six pounds seven shillings for both of us; that's

I 
LEFT dear ould Ireland for the land of the free,

You know this is leap year, and I'm going to try 
To get married just once before I

CuORUS. 
Oh! dear, I 
feel much afraid 
If I 
don't get married I'll die an ould maid. 
My relations they tould me that when I 
came out 
I 
would sure get a 
husband because I 
was stout, 
A

I've been here four years and I've not found one yet.

I'm purty good looking, this dress is bran new,

I'll marry a 
Chinaman and cut off his tail. 
Oh! dear, etc. 
THE WHALE. 
Sung by BILLY Asucaorr. 
'TWA F 
eighteen hundred and forty-five, 
On the twenty-first day of July, 
When our ship set sail with a 
fine and pleasant gale, 
And for Greenland she bore away, brave boys. 
And for Greenland she bore away. 
Now it's when we got to that could country, 
Sure it grieved our hearts full sore 
For to leave our friends and relations 
All behind, and the purty girls on the shore, brave boys, 
And the purty girls on the shore. 
Up aloft, up aloft, the Captain cried out, 
Wid a 
spy glass in his hand, 
A whale! a 
whale! he cried out, 
And she squirted out at every span. brave boys 
And she squirted out at every span. 
Now the boats they were lowered, 
And the lines they were payed out, 
When she gave a 
mighty flourish wid her tail, 
And she upsot the boat and killed five men, 
But they niver got a 
honld of that whale, brave boys, 
But they niver got a 
hould of that whale. 
NOTHING AT ALL. 
As Sung by Gre W ILLIAMS, the American Star Comique, with tremen-
dous applause. 
TN 
Derry- down-dale, when I 
wanted a 
mate, 
went with my feyther a-courtin' to Kate: 
With a 
nosegay so fine in my holiday clothes, 
And my hands in my pockets a- courting I 
goes. 
Now the weather was cool but my bosom was hot, 
My heart in a 
gallop, my old mare in a 
trot, 
And I 
was so bashful, so loving withal, 
My tongue stuck in my moutn and I 
said—nothing at all. 
CHORuS. 
But I 
would if I 
could, if I 
couldn't, how could II 
I 
couldn't without it, now could 1—could you? 
Fol the rol de rol, lol de rol, lol de rol lay, 
Fol the rol de rol, lol de rol, 101 de rol lay. 
When I 
came to the door, I 
looked glumpish and glum, 
The rapper I 
held ' twixt my finger and thumb— 
Rap, rap! went the rapper, Miss Kate showed her chin: 
She chuckled and buckled, I 
bowed and went in. 
Now I 
was as bashful as bashful could be, 
And Kitty, poor girl, was as bashful as me ; 
She simpered and frowned, I 
let my hat fall, 
I 
grinned, scratched my head, and said—nothing at all. 
But I 
would if I 
could, etc. 
Now if bashful was T, not less bashful the maid, 
She simpered and whimpered, with her apron-strings played, 
Till the old folks impatient to have the thing done, 
Agreed little Kitty and I 
should be one. 
In silence we young uns soon nodded consent, 
Hand in hand to the church, to get married, we went. 
Where we answered the parson, in voices quite small, 
Love, honor, obey, and—nothing at all. 
But we would if we could, etc. 
Now what a 
chance in the course of a 
week! 
Miss Kate left off blushin ,,, 
I 
boldly could speak. 
I 
could play with my dearie lanoh loud at a 
jest: 
S!le could coax, to 
and fondle, a well as the best. 
Asimmed of past follies, we often declare 
Well encourage young folks to have in wedlock a 
share, 
And if to their aid some assurance they call, 
'bey ma,y kiss, and get married, and do—nothing at all. 
But they would if they could, etc.

"FLIRTING WITH ME ." 
MURPHY'S LITTLE BACK ROOM. 
As Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
A IR :—" -Winking at Me." 
I'll tell you my troubles as soon as I 
can, 
For I 
certainly am an unfortunate man ! 
Wherever I 
wander, ' tis a 
fact, you'll agree, 
All the girls in the street keep a-flirting with me. 
CHORUS. 
Flirting with me ! 
Flirting with me ! 
It's really a 
shame how they're flirting with me. 
I 
rode in a 'bus down the street Vother day, 
When a 
charmer she gave me her " fare " for to pay. 
She smiled so bewitchingly that I 
plainly could see, 
Her dear " little game " was just flirting with me. 
Flirting with me, 8cc. 
My wife and myself to the theatre went, 
For a " play," why, of course, I 
would spend my last cent, 
My wife got a 
letter, that was dropped on my knee, 
From a 
girl in the box who kept flirting with me 
Flirting with me, Scc. 
I'd like to tell all of my woes, but I 
can't— 
I 
have been down to " Long Branch," with" Gen'l Grant," 
But while I 
was bathing, to my neck in the sea, 
All the girls on the shore kept a 
flirting with me! 
Flirting with me, Sze. 
Thu in such a 
flurry right here where I 
stand, 
You can see now yourselt how I'm truly unmanne.d. 
I'd sing all the evening, but I 
know how 'twould be, 
There's a 
girl over yonder keeps flirting with me! 
Flirting with me, &c. 
Original by ED. HARRIGAN. 
Ain.—" Pat Roach." 
Din you ever hear tell of Ted Murphy 7 
He came from the County Mayo; 
He kept a 
bar- room in this city, 
In a 
Democratic ward here below; 
His distillery was over in Brooklyn, 
In a 
place that they call Irishtown. 
You'd get a 
bucket of ale for five cents; 
He'd trust whin you'd put money down. 
(Repeat two last lines.) 
Success to my friend, Teddy Murphy! 
He often gave me two for one; 
I've played forty-fives at his table, 
Drank his whiskey, his beer, and rum ; 
I've counted the cracks in the ceiling, 
Swept the sand off the fiure wid a 
broom; 
I've raffled for many a 
turkey 
In Ted Murphy's little back room. 
There was laborers, canallers; and riggers, 
Who worked on the docks very hard; 
Shovelmen, pipernen, and drivers, 
Who worked on the big boulevard; 
On Saturday nights they assembled, 
Wid a 
fiddler to play up a 
tune, 
And they danced till the break in the morning, 
In Ted Murphy's little back room. 
There was a 
Dutchman kept over opposite, 
Who was jealous of Ted's rushing trade; 
He put up a 
job one fine evening, 
For the police to go make a 
raid 
On the liquors, barrels, and glasses; 
In the bar-room wid their clubs they wint, 
And poor Teddy, without provocation, 
To the Island for ten days was sint. 
Poor Teddy he lost his influence 
In the courts and the grand committee; 
He sarved his full time in the prison, 
Praying each day to get free. 
He took spunk, and jumped in the river, 
To swim to the Long Island shore; 
He got a 
cramp in his leg and his stomach; 
He sank to rise up no more.

I 
was leader in mischief at school, 
Though always so humble and meek; 
And when I 
discovered a 
chance of reward, 
I 
was always informer and sneak. 
By the evil example I 
set, 
Other boys into mischief were led; 
But I 
always managed to pocket the spoil, 
And get other boys wolloped instead.-Cao. 
When a 
man I 
went into the world, 
I 
plundered the helpless and poor; 
Yet always got off with a 
snug little sum, 
When it came to a 
question of law. 
I 
started benevolent funds, 
And spouted at Exeter Hall, 
I 
started loan offices, hospitals, clubs, 
And finally swindled them all.-Cfro. 
In the City my name I 
keep up, 
And swindling comp'nies promote; 
Yet always creep out with the bulk of the rends, 
Before it's found out it won't float.

To stand I've received an invite; 
And if I

I 
FLATTER myself I'm a

A double-dyed villain, egad ! 
A scally-wag, rascal, and rogue,

A perfect young fiend to my nurse,

From William the Norman to Brigham the Mormon. 
They can't hold a

When first I 
began to cavort, 
A tiny young shaver of six, 
The first thing I 
did of a 
villainous sort 
Was to smash all our kittens with bricks; 
Just ono year from then an old ben

If ever there was an old scamp,

From a

They can't bold a

At twelve I 
was boss of the town, 
Had mashed every kid there was nigh; 
Laid every lad low with a 
fearful knock down, 
And given each one a 
black eye; 
At twenty I 
worked in the banks,

FAIR, FAIR, WITHOUT COMPARE. 
Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
The best little girl that ever I 
met, 
Was one on a 
steamer. I 
can't forget; 
I 
was caught like a 
little fish in a 
net. 
When to Gravesend I 
went for the day. 
She sat by my side with her waving hair, 
I 
thought I 
should like her toy bread to share, 
I 
felt I 
could kiss her, anti did— but there, 
'Twas love that had led me away. 
CHOItra. 
Fair, fair, without compare, 
A 
6(1 aint in her eye, and carroty hair. 
One eye looked here and the other looked there, 
Beautiful, beautiful girl. 
Sh1 had a 
felt hat, with feather dark green. 
Ilcr age I 
should say was about nineteen, 
And she was not too crummy nor yet too lean, 
Just the sort of a 
girl for a 
wife. 
Der waist N
, 
as as round as a 
wedding-ring, 
Like a 
bag of s 
twilust tied round with a 
string, 
She whist.ed the notes she couldn't sing, 
And I 
wished she was mine for lfe. 
Fair, fair, &c 
When Gravesend was reached we went for a 
ridtt. 
And in a 
small boat went down witit the tide, 
But When I 
looked behind me s 
one in it I 
spied, 
Rowing after us two with might and main. 
They pul ed very hard, and she screamed with fright. 
I 
shook like a 
leaf and felt rather white, 
But I 
tried to defend her with all my might, 
And I 
wished myself home again. 
Fair, fair, 5:4. 
These men for a 
lark thenloarded my boat, 
And collaed my waistcoat, my girl and my coat. 
'rook Inv sculls and my rudder, and , et we afloat, 
And drifted right down to the sea. 
They dragged her away, she began to cry, 
The boat sprang. a 
leak too, oh! crikey my, 
And but for a 
fishing-bo it that was nigh, 
It soon would have been all IT.P 
Fair, fair, & o. 
I 
got up to town on the following day, 
And for my diversion I 
had to pay, 
The expense of ne w 
clothes, so advice take, pray 
Mind don't do the Sante thing as me. 
'Twits ltiveat first sight tho' I 
must confess, 
To see her again I 
a 
wish possess. 
.A nil if I 
cmild find out the girl's address, 
Delighted indeed I 
skould he.

MY VIFE IS SO AWFULLY THIN. 
Sung by Gus Wawais. 
The Music of this song is published by FIZEDERICI BLUME, 27 Union 
Square, New York. 
Price 3,5 cents. 
YOU'VE heard aboud a 
gal I 
lov'd, 
Dot used to be so stout; 
How she " shook me" und just because 
I 
could not take her out 
To balls und parties mid all dot, 
licit I 
dought vas a 
sin; 
But now I've got a 
new sweetheart, 
Und she is awful thin. 
CHORUS . 
She is so thin, dot vere she here, 
You could not see her; don't dot seem queer ? 
Bad luck have I—oh, I 
shall die; 
My vife is so awfully thin. 
Vere I 
first met dis female straw, 
'Dwas at a 
coundry fair, 
She vos valkincr long mit her mamma,' 
Und had such nice blonde hair; 
I 
spoke to her, she spoke to me, 
Ye got acquainted den; 
Ye married vere, und after dot 
She commenced to grow thin. 
SPOKEN.—She is the thinnest of the thin; she used to work in 
an insdrument factory, cleaning out flutes; I 
used to play 
"Hide und Seek" mit her, und she used to hide in de gas 
pipe. 
I 
took her oud riding vouce, und I 
grabbed her instead 
of de whip; I 
never took her oud after dot. 
I 
vos valtzing 
mit her at a 
ball vonce, und de floor manager come up uric' 
said, " Young man, you vill have to leave your cane in de hat 
room, it's not allowed on de floor !" I 
told him ' twos no cane, 
but my rife. 
De oder day rile ve vos ouci. valkina, I 
saw a 
man 
selling leetle red balloons for ten cends; I 
bought cone, und

haven't 
seen her since, but 
She is so thin, etc.

MY VIFE IS SO AWFULLY STO1TD. 
Sung by Gus W ILLIAMS with great success. 
Air..-" My Vile is SO Awfully Thin !" 
I 
voNcE did love a 
roman, dot used to be so stoud, 
Und people dey vould laugh at her venever she'd walk oud 
But sdill I 
loved her druly, I 
knew it vos no sin, 
I 
dought dot in de future she vould gradually grow thin. 
CIIOEUS . 
She vos so stoud, Ten she'd Talk oud, 
People you'd clink dot see VOS a 
balloon 
To take dem up—just like a " scup," 
Und make a 
small call on de man in de moon. 
She looked just like an elephant, she had such a 
big ear, 
But she could valk as lightly as any person here; 
To tell you all aboud her, I 
now intend to try, 
Und vile I 
am a- speaking, I 
hope you will not cry. 
SPOKEN.—I'll 
never forget ven I 
firsd got acquainted mit 
her, she vos travelling mit a 
circus, she vos de fat voman, she 
veighed eight hundred pounds; I 
used to call her " Birdie!' 
her right name vos " Ostrich." 
I 
took her oud sleigh- riding 
vonce, she got in, und dere vos just room for me to " cut on 
behind !" I 
looked like an icicle on a 
gutter. 
Ye drove out on 
de road, und stopped in front of a 
hotel, de proprietor came 
oud und told me to move avay, as no vone could see de hotel 
vile she stayed dere. 
I 
took her bathing vonce, de moment 
she got in de water, de tide vent up dree foot, she asked rue to 
float her, I 
tried to, but came near drowning; I 
told her I 
vos 
no derrick! 
But she could dance like a 
fairy, dot is, a 
fairy 
her size; I 
used, in waltzing, to put my arm around her waist 
as far as I 
could, und reach mit a 
boat-hook de rest of de dis-
tance; und she vos an awful eater, she could eat a 
water- melon 
just as easy as I 
could take a 
pill. 
I 
took de size of her finger 
vonce to have an engagement ring made, I 
vent down to the 
eweller, I 
said, " Make me a 
ring dis size, und I 
rant it to fit 
veil ;" he said, " Bring de keg down here, und let roe fit it on." 
I 
don't speak to her now, tecause she wanted me to take her 
to a 
masquerade ball disguised as a 
pipe- stem. 
I 
knew dot 
every vone vould laugh at me I 
if done so, for 
She vos so stood, etc.

Will gaily raise its bat. 
It sneers at the unlucky, 
But*smiles on he who wins: 
And gold will gloss and cover 
Quite a 
multitude of sins.

The maid both plain and ancient, 
Appears a 
perfect " sweet " 
If rich, her gold magnetic draws 
" 
Pond" lovers to her feet. 
Some say this Gold's a 
curse, and that 
It causes strife and pride; 
But we know it is a 
blessing, 
When it's properly applied. 
Cno. — Gold, gold, gold, ttc.

Love and content in a 
cottage 
I've heard of, so have you; 
But I 
fear that kind of bliss 
Is only experienced by few: 
When trouble comes unto the door, 
Love flies, or else grows cold; 
And the only thing to warm it up 
Is Gold, gold, gold. 
Cno.—Gold, gold, gold,

DON'T GE: IT ON TRE BLAIN. 
Written and Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Air:—" You May Call Me a 
Quiz." 
I'll take this occasion to give you advice, 
It's meant in good part, so receive it quite nice. 
Don't ever be urLr.ed to take out a 
kink, 
When you know you don't want it, by taking a 
drink. 
I'll tell you the reason, and this is the why, 
And the truth, it' you're smart, you cannot deny, 
There's no luck in a 
drink, I 
tell you again, 
No luck with anything square on the brain. 
Spoken.—Yes, what's the use of punishing one's bowels to 
accommodate a 
friend, and keep a 
shingle.on sonic bum-
mer's house ? 
Whisky on the brain is a 
bad complaint, and 
so is this fashion of 
don't spend all your money in one 
house." and rushing around from gin-mill to gin- mill tor 
the sake of a familiar nod from a 
bar- keeper, for the pur-
pose of making folks think you're somebody. 
This fancy, 
of a 
man's trying to prove he ain't a 
sardine, always proves 
the lad only lacks the pickle to make one. 
These are the 
chaps who chuck their money over the bar as fast a; they 
get it, and generally wind up as free-lunch fiends. 
No. no, 
boys! keep your heads clear, and, above all thing-s, never 
get ruin on the brain. 
There's more I 
will tell you, and I 
want you to bear, 
And the truth, laddie bucks, 3 
ou'll see will appear, 
Don't spend all you're tune at poker and bluff, 
Or keno, or faro, or prize-candy sAuff. 
Your friends and yourself will serve you the best turn. 
By keeping. the money whatever you earn ; 
Don't spend it in hair-grease. or la-da-de-da's, 
Or taking out lady-loves with their intun'inas. 
Spoken.—Yes, these are some of the things which young 
men should avoid ; a 
little game occasionally, however 
harmless, is a 
bad thing to get on the brain. 
In most of 
these games the more you lay down the less you take up; 
[1] 
DON'T GET IT ON THE BRAIN.H_CoNcLuDED 
and as to making anything out of a 
prize-candy package, 
why, you might as well lay a 
ten- cent stamp on the side-
walk, and wait for sonic one to come along and cover it, 
with as good a 
show as you have in getting anything out 
of a 
prize- candy package. 
No, no, save your money ; buy 
a 
house, put a 
Bowery girl in it, and set her to work mak-
ing a 
uniform for the expected little la-de-da. 
There's another thing, laddies, on free-love don't bet, 
Against Woman's Rights just make a 
dead set, 
And don't get politics or office on the brain, 
But stick to square labor, and honor you 11 gain. 
Be honest, be brave, act square with a 
friend, 
Be true to your country, and money don't lend, 
Your words keep together, stay shady and sane, 
And nothing whatever gets on to the brain. 
Spoken.—Yes, above all things. put your foot down on 
these free- love doctrines; give the coining generation the 
saute chance to know their daddies that you have had ; 
(rive a 
woman the right to do anything but make a 
darned 
fool of themselves. 
Don't it sound nice for an old maid of 
sixty to go upon the public platform and cry out against 
these horrid, horrid men ; and ain't they high old subjects 
that lecture on the manner of bringing up babies without 
nursing. 
And, above all 
things, don't spend your life 
loafing around, waiting for a 
change of administration, or 
something to tnrn up. 
Get knowledge, lint nothing else 
on the brain, and you'll be hunkie, and that's where the 
duck swims. 
You may call me a 
quiz, you may call me a 
qui, 
But these are the things that are queer to the eye, 
And Ill tell you in earnest,  and tell you again, 
sever get anything square on the brain, 
But keep a 
stray oar. whatever you do, 
With freedom to paddle you own canoe, 
As there's nothing so fatal, I 
tell you again. 
As getting any one thing square on the brain.

'LONGSHOREMAN'S STRIKE; OR, THE POOR 
MAN'S FAMILY. 
Words by ED. HARRIGAN. 
Music by DAVID BRAHAlferr. 
Sung by ED. TharnmeN, in his side-splitting sketch, " Raffle for a 
Clock." 
! 
I 
am a 
simple, laboring man, 
I 
work along the shore, 
To keep the hungry wolves away 
From the poor ' longshoreman's door; 
I 
toil all day in the broiling sun 
On the ships that come from sea ; 
From broad daylight till late at night, 
For a 
poor man's family. 
CH ORE'S. 
Give us fair pay for every day 
Is what we ask of ye ; 
Our cause is right, 
We are out on a 
strike 
For a 
poor man's family. 
Oh ! the rich one's gilded carriages 
And horses swift and strong, 
Whin a 
poor man asks for a 
bite to eat 
They tell him he is wrong ; 
Go take your shovel in your band, 
Go out and work for me ; 
Die or live they have nothing to give 
To a 
poor man's family. 
Give us, etc. 
They bring over their Italians 
And Chinamen from the South; 
Thinking they can do our work, 
Take the bread from out our mouths. 
The white man's children they must starve ; 
Shure we will not agree 
To be put down like a 
worm in the ground, 
And starve our family. 
Give us, etc.

THE BOWERY FANCY BALL. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR 
Ma—" Billy Johnson's Ball." 
Spoken.—I 
went to a 
ball last evening. 
Now, a 
ball is an 
interesting subject to sing about. 
The young ladies like 
to go to a 
ball. 
Young fellows play base bail. 
The old 
fellows like to 
take a 
ball." 
The boys who go skating 
like to see the " ball up," Even babies when spanked. will 
bawl, and many a 
young gentleman, when hard up, will go 
to the sign of three balls. " Oh, my prophetic soul, my 
uncle l"—lIamlet—but I'll tell you of another ball. 
In Centre Market many a 
day 
Bill John.son kept a 
stand ; 
His uncle died, a 
fortune left, 
Which Billy got in hand. 
The grand event to celebrate, 
lie went and hired a 
hall, 
And all his friends invited to 
A regular Bowery ball. 
Spoken.—I regret to say I 
was out of town, but I fan 
positively assured by him that all the prominent person-
ages were there doing the 
CHORUS. 
Lar dar de dar, and doodle doodle, diddle, 
They played upon the fiddle, and went up and down the 
Such jolly boys and pretty girls, enough to please you all, 
Oh, wasn't it a 
regular spree, the Bowery fancy ball. 
Bill Tweed and Andy Garvey 
Were the first upon the floor. 
When the Count Joannes and Beecher 
Promenaded through the door. 
Dick Connoly and Joe Dowling 
Were the next to enter in ; 
Then George Law and Horace G-reeley, 
Did an Irish jig begin. 
Spoken.—Yes, as Nelse Seymour remarked, in his pecu-
liar German brogue: " They welted the flure ailual to 
Reddy the Goldsmith." And only they were stopped by 
Mat Brennan, they'd have knocked all the putty out of the 
cracks while doing the 
Lar de dar, & e. 
THE BOWERY FANCY BALL.—[CONCLuDED. 
Okey Hall, with Annie Dickinson, 
Next cut a 
pigeon wing, 
While Little Mac, with Edwin Booth, 
Went for a 
highland fling. 
Then Bergh, the pigeon shooter, 
Said like dancing he did feel, 
And with Victoria Woodhull danced 
An old Virginia reel. 
Spoken.—Yes, they danced away. 
Bergh declared it 
would be cruelty to animals to stop them. 
And Victoria 
remarked that he danced so well she didn't care about 
" 
changing her partner every day," while doing the 
Lar de dar, 
Duke Alexis, then, with Harry Hill, 
A waltz did soon begin ; 
Corny Vanderbilt and Lucy Stone, 
The merriment joined in. 
Then to the bar Ben Butl-r did 
With Jimmy O'Brien, steer, 
Where Iielmbold served the buchu, 
And Frank Duffy the root beer. 
,C'poken.—James called for green seal. 
Ben said he'd 
take a hot vhiiskv. with a silver spoon in it. 
But the 
crown prince, Frank Duffy, told thew they'd better take 
root beer, with vanilla syrup, that was all the style at the 
Grand Central, corner of Bowery and Grand, for all who 
danced 
Lar de dar, 
Olive Logan and Dan Bryant 
Were gone out to supper now, 
But Fernando Wood got jealous, 
And soon commenced a 
row ; 
Beecher tapped a 
keg of lager beer, 
'Which soon appeased them all, 
And they with a 
can-can winded up 
The Bowery fancy ball. 
ipoken.—Billy Johnson told me that General Grant was 
present. 
But I 
don't believe it. 
He has such an objection 
to anything in the shape of a 
present, or anything of the 
kind, or that he danced 
Lac tie dal., ekc.

I 
bear this in mind, Somebody's l
ooking,love,pull down the blind. 
How loving we were! how cosy 
we'd chat 
'Bout one thing and Vother, and this thing, and 
th at; 
With my arm round her wai
st, how 
cosy 
we 
sat, 
Like two little turtle doves perch'd on 
a 
tree; 
Such squeezing, and teasing, 
and 
pleasi
ng 
we had, 
Such wooing, and cooi ng, 
t
o make 
our hearts 
glad; 
With laughing and chaffing I 
near drove her mad, 
But still she was awfully spooney 
on 
me: 
SPOKEN :— A nd if that Soldier would only have left us alone, she would never 
have exclaimed :—Csonus. 
One night, for a 
change, we went 
t
o 
th e Pl ay, 
And when we got home she was 
awf
ull y 
gay, 
She saw them make love, and so l
earn'd th e 
way, 
The piece was " Claude Melnotte," and 
suited 
her 
fi
ne; 
She call'd me her rose-bud, her duck, and 
her dear, 
She threw her arms round me, while f
ast 
f
ell each 
tear; 
She cried, oh, don't leave me, for sadly I 
f
ear 
You don't love me truly, say, will you be 
m i
ne ? 
SpottEsi—Just at that moment a 
Policeman passed and 
she 
sa id :—CuoRtts. 
Our courting days o'er, at last we were wed, 
I 
oft bless the hour when to church her I 
l
ed, 
I 
now call her Mary, and she calls me Ned; 
We're happy and loving, and never know st rife, 
We've a 
line, handsome lass, and 
t
wo 
noble boys, 
Trouble or sorrow ne'er us annoys; 
Of life we've the sweets, and while tasting its joys, 
I'm thankful, I'm bless'd with a 
good little 
w ife. 
SPosEN:—And should an angry word 
ri
se t
o 
my 
lips, w i
th a 
meek smile on 
her face she'll exclaim :—Cliouus. 
(

I'm the great Calico, 
All the way from FIonalue, 
Whar we eat the missionary 
In a 
fry or in a 
stew. 
Just come among you 
To gaze upon de town, 
Help de politicians 
Chuck de money all around. 
Bar curls crooked 
As a 
Virginia rail fence; 
Gwine to show de government 
A 
little real sense. 
Very fond of sandwiches— 
I 
never eat snow; 
Bic* Kanawa Chief, 
Old King Calico. 
CHORUS. 
Ott up on your mule, 
Catch him by de tail; 
If he chucks you in de Tombs 
The King will go your bail; 
Royal Injun blood, 
He's blacker dan crow; 
Eat up all de babies 
Wid King Calico. 
If old King William, 
Or Gara-bald-eye, 
Came to dis country, 
You'd feed ' em on pie, 
But when I

Are bound for to bust.

Board in de White House

ALDGATE PUMP. 
As Sung by TONT PASTOR. 
You here behold the remnants of 
A 
blighted, sad young man, 
The victim of a 
faithless girl, 
Forget her I 
never can. 
Ah, she was fair to look at, 
Her sweet name was Betsy Crump; 
The first time that I 
saw her, 
It was close to Aldgate pump. 
CHORUS. 
Farewell, naughty Betsy, 
Farewell Betsy Crump, 
1 
never shall forget the gal 
I 
met near Aldgate pump. 
'Twas at the pump we used to meet, 
And then we'd take a 
walk; 
She used to dress so nice and neat, 
And, oh, bow sweet she'd talk; 
But when we used to part, my heart 
With agony would jump; 
And in my sleep I'd dream sweet dreams 
Of her and Aldgate pump. 
But all my dreams ot tuture bliss 
Were turned to grief and woe, 
I 
found that the deceitful Miss 
Had two strings to her bow 
[

Farewell, &c. 
ALDGATE PUMP.—[CoNcLuDan, 
This (h) arrowed up my feelings so 
I 
told her plain :Intl plump' 
That either he or I 
must die, 
And I 
swore by Aldgate pump. 
Farewell, eze. 
One night, whilst at the usual spot, 
Expecting her to see, 
Some fellow came up like a 
shot, 
And gently collared me; 
'Twas my sanguinary rival yes 
The beau of Betsy Crump; 
Somehow be got me underneath, 
And then began to pump. 
Spoken—I 
shiver when I 
think of the drenching I 
received at 
the bands of that bloodthirsty individual, but nevertheless I 
re-
peat— 
Farewell, & c. 
I 
don't believe in cold water cure, 
don't believe in love 
Since she's turnel oat a 
viper 
Whom I 
fancied was a 
dove. 
They're ma ried now, and I 
am told 
They've got three children plump 
One's like her and one's like him— 
And one's like Aldgate pump. 
Spoken— And although I 
might have been the successful pro-
genitor of those infantile squealers— if not more so— I 
am still 
sufficiently placid to once more remark—

I AIN'T A GWINE TO DO SO NO MOAB. 
Written by N ED H ARRIGAN expressly for BILLY W EST. 
I've had my share of trouble, 
While I've been here below ; 
By being Kind o' foolish, 
Slice I 
began to grow. 
I 
throwed away my books, 
When I 
went to school ; 
The teacher stood me on a 
desk, 
For the boys to call me fool. 
CHORUS. 
Unt I 
ain't a 
gwine to do so no more, 
I 
ain't a 
gwine to do so no more. 
De teacher cut my hand with his awful big ratan, 
But he ain't a 
gwine to do so no more. 
I 
used to go a 
fishing, 
Wid needles, hooks and pin ; 
Fish jerked me in de water, 
And den I 
couldn't swim. 
I 
floated like a 
sponge cake, 
I 
used in water soak ; 
De doctor said they couldn't drown, 
Such an awful foolish moke. 
CHORUS• 
But I 
ain't a 
gwine to do so no more, 
I 
ain't a 
gwine to do so no more, 
Salt water ain't dry, if you don't believe it go and try. 
But I 
ain't a 
gwine to do so no mole, 
Den I 
went and fell in love, 
I 
fell almighty bard ; 
Wid a 
gal who had a 
temper, 
You could measure by the yard. 
She hit me wid a 
club, 
When I 
asked her for a 
kiss: 
She went and got her brother Bill, 
For to shoot at me and miss. 
CHORUS. 
But he ain't a 
gwine to do so no more, 
Be ain't a 
gwiue to do so no more, 
I'm gwine to stay under the bed and coverup my head, 
He ain't a 
gwine to do so no more. 
I 
wish I 
was an onion, 
'Rout a 
water melon size ; 
id git in dot gal's family, 
To make her cry out her eyes. 
If I 
was a 
bull doz. 
Her brother Bill I'd bite ; 
Den he'd go mad and eat his dad. 
Don't you think that's doing right. 
CHORUS. 
But I 
ain't a ;...m-ine to do so no more. 
I 
ain't a 
gwine to do so no more, 
Fqr Hydrophobia's bad, there's no fun in getting mad 
I 
ain't a 
gwine to do so no more.

Rite face abotal, turn inside oud— 
Hurrah, for the German Fifth. 
Ven we vos in dot army, 
Ye got fed on barrel- staves, 
Und wen we don't vos fight 
Ye had to work at digging graves; 
Und we got so awful slim 
Dot you could see us drough und drough, 
Vile we was owl a- marching, 
Den our feet were plack und. pine. 
Double rank, etc. 
Now we vos home-guard privates, 
Ye got blenty grub to ead, 
Und all vos jealous of us, 
Ven we walk along de sdreed ; 
But den dot doesn't matter, 
For wherever we may go, 
'ire show such splendid marching, 
In de rain, or drough de snow.

HOW DEAR TO ME THE HOUR 
By THOMAS MOORE. 
How dear to me the hour when daylight dies, 
And sunbeams melt along the silent sea; 
For then sweet dreams of other days arise, 
And menfry breathes her vesper sigh to thee. 
And, as I 
watch the line of light that plays 
Along the smooth wave tow'rd the burning west, 
I 
long to tread that golden pllth of rays, 
And think 'twould lead to some bright isle of rest.

THE FLANNEL MOUTH MICK. 
Written by W ILLIAM W ELCH 
of Simmons and Slocum's Minstrels. 
I 
KNOW you'll have pity 
When you hear what I 
say— 
The way I 
have been treated 
By the blackguards each day, 
Who stand on the corners, 
As I 
pass them by, 
You can hear them say plainly, 
Arrah, " stag the old guy." 
CIIORUS . 
Oh, OA- yell out, " You terrier, 
Go shoot that hat quick ! " 
They call me a 
chow and 
A 
flannel mouth mick. 
The other day while a-walking 
I 
went down the street, 
A 
charming young damsel 
By chance I 
did meet ; 
Says I, " You look charming, 
Ah, cushla ma Tick ;" 
Says she, " Drop on yourself, 
You flannel mouth mick." 
Oh, they yell out, etc. 
When election day comes, 
I 
know what they'll say— 
" 
How are you, Mr. McGuinness, 
how are you ? good day." 
They'll hand me a 
ticket, 
Say, " Go vote it, now quick—" 
I'm a 
gentleman then, 
And no flannel mouth mick. 
Oh, they yell out, etc.

DAINTY LITTLE NAN. 
Sung by liAnniGAN & H ART. 
Oh, you can guess why I 
come here, 
Dressed in my best attire, 
I 
feel so good, oh my, on dear, 
My bosom is on fire. 
It caught the flame from a 
little doye, 
So close to me she ran, 
And ever since I've been in love 
With dainty little Nan. 
Dainty little Nan, 
1'11 do everything I 
can, 
Your fancy for to please, 
You're sweeter than a 
plum, 
And always full of fun, 
Like the little birds singing from the trees. 
Oh, I 
got acquainted with her ma, 
And the way it came around, 
I 
was riding in a 
city horse-car 
To my residence, way up-town. 
" 
If you please," says she, " I'll take a 
seat, 
While you hold my daughter's fan," 
I 
took one look, there laughing sweet, 
Sat dainty little Nan. 
Dainty little Nan, t

Oh, what a 
pleasant, quiet chat, 
I

Oh, I 
like her, and she likes me, 
And now I

Little Nan I'm going to see, 
For her folks are out to-day.

WAITING FOR CHARLEY AT UNION SQUARE. 
AIR:—" Waiting for Nelly at Temple Bar." 
By H . 
FITCHETT, Jr., 
There's nothing half so jolly 
As courting, I 
am sure, 
For so experience teaches me, 
I 
wish for nothing more ; 
As I 
love a 
chap so fervently, 
A most enchanting fel', 
And there's not another I 
declare, 
Can equal Charley Bell. 
CHORUS. 
Waiting for Charley : t 
Union Square, 
Waiting for Charley at Union Square, 
Every night when the stars shine bright. 
I'm waiting for Charley at Union Square. 
'Twas fortunate I 
met with him, 
For with friends 1 
used to go, 
And dissipate and waste my time, 
I 
thought love-making slow. 
And when I 
chance to meet them now, 
They say " 1 
stay away," 
Where are you to be met with ?" 
So this is what I 
say. 
Waiting for Charley, &e. 
Industrious my Charley is, 
And works throughout the day, 
From Union Square, not very far, 
Where 1 
so often stray. 
In that neighbohood I 
always am, 
I've oft heard folks declare, 
They'd fail to recognise the spot, 
If by chance I 
were not there. 
Waiting for Charley, &e. 
My hub. my Charley soon will be, 
And then my task will end, 
rn not desert the " Square," till then, 
On that you may depend ; 
And any night that way you stroll, 
Fixed as the evening star, 
You'll find me waiting ' near the gate, 
For Chat ley at Union Square. 
Waiting for Charley, Ste.

DE WAITER GAL. 
Humorous recitation by ED. H ARAIG111. 
'TWAS nioht time by der summer, 
Von a 
beer garten all alone, 
I 
set up mit a 
vooden dable, 
Five thousand miles von home. 
I 
vos finking, of mine family, 
Away by faderland, 
Ven der" Wacht um Rhine " began to spell 
By Krout's German band. 
'Twas then I 
vas transported, 
Nit excitement mit dat tune, 
Ven I 
hear a 
sweet voice crying out, 
Make vay dare, give me room. 
I 
looked up mit eyes outstretched, 
Und dere behind dot barrel, 
Drawing beer for der Deitcher near, 
Vas Louise, der vaiter gal. 
Mit a 
glass I 
bit dot dable, 
Den I 
called Louise to me; 
Und like a 
leedle baby child, 
She set up oof mine knee. 
Den I 
looked dare by her eyebrows, 
Churst like a 
horse's tail, 
Und I 
said, " you come von Bremen, 
By dot iron steamboat mail." 
Louise said " swelve year ago, 
I 
runned away from home; 
Und ey'ry place by dis wide world, 
Nit sorrow I 
have roam'd. 
Because my poor old mudder 
Vas sick so much dat time, 
Und ladder vas a 
soldier, 
Und keeped der Wacht urn Rhine." 
Den I 
said, " Louise, 
Would you knew fadder now I" 
She said, " I've got his picture, 
Und mudder, dot's he's frau." 
She tooked a 
locket von her bosom, 
Und opened out der case, 
Und dere vas my sweet Gretchen, 
Laughing by mine face. 
WHY DON'T YOU HIRE A TTALT, P 
By GEORGE S. 
KNIGHT. 
I 
CAME out here when very small, 
The time I 
don't know when,— 
At first I 
did not know so much, 
But I'm smarter now than then; 
I 
keep a 
liquor store down town, 
Where all the boys did meet, 
And the funny things to me they said 
To you now I'll repeat. 
CHORUS . 
Why don't you hire a 
hall ? 
Oh, say go shoot that hat— 
I 
commence to think you are too fresh; 
Go jump in some salt vat,— 
Don't talk us all to death; 
Oh, tumble, do now, Ned,— 
Cheese it now—give us a 
rest— 
Swim out, you're over your head. 
I 
soon commenced to see and know 
What everything they meant, 
And that the business didn't pay, 
I 
couldn't make a 
cent; 
So then I 
put my foot right down, 
I 
likewise told my clerk 
To tell them fellows when they'd come 
That business wouldn't work. 
Why don't you, etc. 
BUFFALO. 
Written by Ned Harrigan. 
Sung by BILLY IV Ert. 
From Buffalo I've just come down 
On the good boat Danger; 
A long, long trip on the Erie, boys, 
I 
feel just like a 
stranger. 
We'd heavy fogs, and awful storms, 
Forget ' em I 
never shall ; 
I'm every inch a 
sailor boy, 
On the E-ri-e Canal. 
We were loaded down with barley, 
When we bid good bye 
When a 
pirate bore upon us, 
With an awful wicked eye. 
I 
saw him through the spy-glass, 
I 
put up a 
flag of truce ; 
I 
found it was the Three Sisters, 
Four days from Syracuse. 
Three days' out we struck a 
rock, 
Of Lackawana coal; 
It gave the boat an awful shock, 
And stove in quite a 
hole. 
I 
halloed to the driver. 
On the tow-path's treaden dirt; 
He came abmrd and stopped the leak, 
With his flannel undershirt. 
In two years we reached the Hudson, 
We hadn't slept a 
wink; 
The crew mutinized 
Because I 
refused a 
drink. 
keep up your courage, then I 
cried, 
I'll bring you safely in ; 
And when we strike a 
grocery store, 
We'll swim in barrels of frill. 
The storm went down, we went ashore, 
Me and Sal ad Hank; 
Greased ourselves with tallow- fat, 
And slid out on a 
plank. 
Sal is in the Poor House, I 
oys, 
The crew are all in jail ; 
I'm the only sole sarvivi*g 
Left to tell the tale. 
Spoken.— So Haul in your 
Stand by your sorrel mule, 
Low bridge, boys, dodge your heads; 
Don't act just like a 
fool. 
CRORC8. 
For the Erie is a 
rising, 
And the 
in is getting low: 
I 
hardly think you'll get a 
drink, 
Till we go back to MEW*. 
THE WHISKEY OF EXQUISITE SMELL. 
Words and Melody by H ARRY M ACARTHY. 
Arranged by H. MoEsLgur.

York.

Copyright, 1875, by H ARRY M ACARTHY. 
THERE'S a 
cot in old Ireland that stands near a 
brook, 
Where my daddy's own darling was born, 
And into the parlor the pigs used to look, 
And the cow with the crook in her horn, 
And the chickens and the ducks used to make morning calls 
With the neighbors that around us did dwell ; 
But what was the charm in my father's mud walls ? 
'Twas the whiskey with exquisite smell. 
'Twas our whiskey with exquisite smell. 
Our garden abounded with flowers so bright, 
The richest old Erin could boast; 
Such a 
beautiful blending of red, green, and white, 
Which enchanted we knew not the most; 
But oh, not a 
flow'r where the bee could repose, 
With fragrance could ever excel 
The scent that at eventide always arose 
From our whiskey with exquisite smell. 
From our whiskey with exquisite smell. 
Ohl Erin, the maidens that trip o'er thy mounts, 
They're as bright and as fair as the day ; 
They're as pure as the waters that flow from thy founts, 
And as bright as each sparkle of spray ; 
Oh, where is the man who their beauty defies 7 
Or has felt not their witchery's spell ? 
Oeh ! I'm bother'd if most to adore their bright eyes, 
Or the whiskey with exquisite smell. 
Or the whiskey with exquisite smell.

WrrAT is home without a 
wife 
To cheer our lonely way ? 
What is home without a 
babe 
To bless us day by day ? 
Who would miss a 
mother's smile, 
The best the world e'er saw ? 
But what is home, 
Ah, what is home, without a

now, ah! alas !— 
CHORUS. 
Oh, that man to joy is dead— 
Naught his gladness can restore— 
If he's to an orphan wed, 
And has no mother-in-law! 
Home is sweet when full of love, 
Tho' poor that home may be; 
Go and search the wide world o'er, 
No dearer place we see; 
When in distant lands we roam, 
'Tis cherished more and more, 
And then it is we sigh for her— 
Our own dear mother-in-law! 
SPOKEN.—I 
really do " cherish my home," but under the cir-
cumstances " more roaming and less sighing " would greatly in-
crease the " cherish," because— 
Oh, that man, etc. 
Who doth watch our every step 
With never-tiring eye ? 
Who will chide each little fault 
With many a 
weary sigh 
Who can make our cottage blessed 
As Eden was of yore 7 
Our wives are fond, but what is home 
Without a 
mother-in-law ? 
SPOKEN.— Of course I 
can " go " a 
little watching, and chid-
ing, but as for my " cottage being blessed," you will agree with 
me in saying— 
(
1) 
Oh, that man, etc.

LAW) 
P— Continued. 
Sweet her kind endearing smiles, 
Like sunshine after rain ; 
Sweet her oft bestowed advice 
That charms the heart from pain; 
Bless the dear old party's curls, 
And never-ending jaw; 
No pleasant home should be without— 
Without a 
mother-in-law. 
SPOKEN.-My fortunate friends, it is not for me to expatiate 
upon her noble qualities of heart and mind.

W HAT is -home without a 
wife 7 
'Tis her smiles that make home dear; 
All is lost when her sweet life 
Departs, with many a 
bitter tear! 
My early love is in the grave, 
My home once bright is so no more; 
Above her now the willows wave, 
And naught can e'er my joy restore! 
What is home without a 
wife ? 
'Tis her smiles that make home dear; 
All is lost when her sweet life 
Departs, with many a 
bitter tear! 
She was like a 
sunny beam, 
All the world she was to me! 
Life it was a 
blissful dream; 
'Tis now a 
weary and troubled sea! 
I 
long to clasp her to my heart 
In yonder radiant home above; 
There every sorrow shall depart, 
And be forgot in joy or love. 
What is home without a 
wife ? 
'Tis her smiles that make home dear; 
All is lost when her sweet life 
Departs, with many a 
bitter tear!

WHILST THE HANDS GO ROUND THE CLOCK. 
Written and sung by Master LovEtocx. 
Am.—" Starry Night for a 
Ramble," 
W HAT strange events occur each day 
On this Island of Manhattan, 
Where some roam round half starved and cold, 
Whilst others gorffe and fatten; 
Some ride, some walk, some sing, some talk, 
Some at each other mock; 
All play their part in this busy mart, 
As the hands go round the clock. 
CHORUS. 
Then list to me while I 
relate, 
how as I 
passed each block, 
And on each event did meditate, 
Whilst the hands went round the clock. 
At early morn the newsboys shout, 
As through the streets they run, 
Whilst hundreds hurrying to their work, 
Proclaim the day begun; 
Every specimen of humanity 
Thro' the streets in crowds do flock, 
Each wend their way to their place of work, 
Whilst the hands go round the clock. 
') 
Then list to me, etc. 
The day advances, still the crowds 
Are hurrying thro' the streets, 
Police escorting ladies o'er, 
Whilst friends each other greet; 
The judges on the benches 
And the criminals under locks, 
All play their part in this busy scene 
As the hands go round the clock. 
Then list to me, etc-
'Twas now noonday, and such a 
scene 
To describe I 
feel unable; 
As they crowd around at saloons and stands, 
And struggle for seats at the table; 
They talk, they eat, they drink, they treat, 
Beer, whiskey, gin, egcf,-nog, 
Fish, fowl, pigs' feet, all kinds of meat, 
As the hands go round the clock. 
Then list to me, etc. 
(1) 
The working class now homeward trudge, 
Their daily toil is o'er, 
And motley groups are mustering round 
At each theatre door; 
To all places of amusement 
All the pleasure seekers flock, 
Each one will resort to lii 
favorite spot, 
Whilst the hands go round the clock. 
Then list to me, etc. 
There were places too where folks rushed in, 
Like boys crowding into school. 
An advertisement outside announces 
A game they call French Pool; 
There was a 
loud clickin' sound as the horses spun round, 
You might have heard it half a 
block, 
And hundreds lost their money there, 
As the hands went round the clock. 
Then list to me, etc. 
I 
spent the night in roaming round, 
And seeing many sights, 
With drunken men and women too, 
Engaged in broils and fiffhts; 
Some staggered and fell, their address couldn't tell, 
Were marched off to be placed under lock, 
To the rub-a-dub-dub of the officer's club, 
As the hands went round the clock. 
Then list to me, etc. 
The large hand now had reached to four, 
The small one points to three, 
I 
safely reached my own street door, 
And appliel my night-latch key ; 
Once in, I 
hurried to my bed, 
Having first secured the lock, 
And dreamed of all the sights I 
saw, 
Whilst the hands went round the clock. 
Then list to me, etc.

Price 40 cents. 
W HEN I 
was " broke and busted," and pinched for meat and 
bread, 
I 
joined a 
little party to " work them up ahead ;" 
That is, I 
was the agent, and the agent's business is 
To " fix things" true and trusty for a 
good and healthy " biz ;" 
I " wrestled programmes" in the town, and helped to stick the 
bills, 
" 
button-holed the locals," and I 
advertised the mills; 
I 
got long " puffs" of eighty lines in papers that were read, 
I 
tell you it's a 
bully job to work the show ahead. 
CHORUS. 
Working ahead, working ahead ; I 
tell you it's a 
bully job, 
When you are pinched for bread, 
To let yourself as agent and work the show ahead. 
figured close on contracts for Iraggaffe, board and halls, 
And on the correspondents I 
made short and friendly calls ; 
I 
gave my " comps " to railroad men including engineer, 
And didn't change a 
date unless the town was " very queer," 
I 
travelled some on beauty, and a 
lot of pretty girls 
I 
often " mashed " completely with my glossy raven curls, 
They all would make me dine with them, for I 
was easy led, 
Oh, it is just a 
bully job to work the show ahead. 
Working ahead, etc. 
I 
always wore a 
diamond pin when out upon the road, 
And when I 
could get trusted l 
would dress up a 
la moie; 
I 
used to think it gave the show a 
cultivated tone 
To have the anent looking nice, if clothes were not his own ; 
Oh I 
was just the " boss" of all the boys within the land, 
And if a 
brother " struck a 
snag " 
lent a 
helping band ; 
I 
was a 
very useful man the m anagers all said. 
And every body liked me when 1

St., Boston, Mass. Price 40 cents. 
LITTLE sweetheart now will kiss you, 
Just once more before you go; 
Long and fondly will she miss you, 
While you wander to and fro. 
Oh, her days will be so lonely, 
When her lips no more you press, 
For she loves you, darling, only, 
You were sent her life to bless. 
Ah I 
CHORUS. 
Little sweetheart now will kiss you, 
She will whisper sweet and low; 
Yes, her heart will sadly miss you, 
While you wander to and fro. 
Little sweetheart now will kiss you, 
Praying that we meet again, 
Longing that we soon shall wander, 
As of old, adown the lane. 
Future years will bring us gladness ; 
Let your heart no more repine; 
Ah, my life shall keep no sadness 
While it knows your love is mine. Ali! 
Little sweetheart, etc.

YOU'RE GREEN! 
AIR.—" The Cure." 
Good night; a 
stave I'll try to sing— 
Your call I 
can't refuse ; 
I've come to see this little hall— 
My purpose to amuse. 
A 
bright girl I 
did love one time— 
lier name was Hattie Bean; 
Quoth I, " Dear Hat, wilt be my wife '1" 
" 
Not much !" said she. 
SPOKEN.—" Reason?" said I. " Just ' cause," said she, 
" 
you're green I" 
CHORUS . 
I'm green ! I'm green! 
Oh, ain't I 
awful green! 
" 
I'm green, am 1? 
And so I 
am! 
I've plenty of green-backs." 
This threw a 
new light on my case; 
She went in then for " whacks," 
A 
fry at Dorlan's—then we bled 
To her mansion, all serene. 
" 
Now, Hat, once more—wilt be my wife ?" 
" 
Guess not," said she. 
SPOKEN.—" Reason?" said I. " Just ' cause," said she, 
you're green I" 
I'm green, etc. 
I 
took her to a 
dollar store, 
And made the greenbacks fly; 
My " fourteen dollar suit" I 
wore, 
(1) 
95 
YOU'RE GREEN.—Concluded. 
Her " pull-back " caught each eye. 
I " squoze " a 
fair young damsel's hand, 
She cried, " What do you mean ?" 
" 
I 
love—" " Oh, git !" 
SPOKEN.—" Reason ?" 
said 
I. " Just 'cause," said she, 
" 
you're green !" 
I'm green, etc. 
I 
next went out upon a 
spree, 
Drinking " hot whisks" and " cobblers ;" 
My head grew light as any cork, 
My tongue ran like a 
gobbler's.. 
" 
See here, young sport, I'll run yer in : 
You're acting all- fired mean !" 
" 
Pull down your vest, and let me be !" 
" 
Ger long !" said be. 
r3POREN.—" Reason ?" said I. " Just ' cause," said he, 
" 
you're green !" 
I'm green, etc. 
Next morn I " brought up" at the " Tombs ;" 
The judge looked stern and cruel; 
" 
What is the charge ?" " Drunk as a 
fish !" 
" 
I'll give him wholesome gruel! 
A harder phiz I 
never saw— 
Ten dollars—thirty days !" 
" 
Hold on, old boss! 
Say, what d'yer mean 1 
What for 7" said I. 
SPOKEN.—" Reason ?" said I. " Just ' cause," said he, 
you're green !"

2 I 
spoke to her, she was not vexed, 
I 
lingered by her side, 
I 
thought—has she a 
father, now, 
Or worse—is she a 
bride; 
Beneath her dress a 
natty boot 
Forth peeping I 
could see, 
With such a 
dainty foot, I 
mused 
What must her uncles be. —Ono. 
3 
She stood and leaned against the rails, 
The naughty wind it blew, 
And showed her pretty ancles, but 
Of course she never knew; 
She heeded not, why should she care, 
No harm was meant to be, 
And then I 
thought, she little knew 
Her aucles I 
could see.—Cno. 
4 We chatted till the moon came up, 
Across the wide sea foam, 
And then I 
offered her ray arm 
And saw her to her home; 
For many months I 
courted her 
Our love was sweet to see, 
And every day at five o'clock 
I'd call and have my tea. — CHo. 
5 I 
need not say, she is my wife, 
For one fine afternoon, 
I 
married her and rushed abroad 
To spend the honeymoon; 
She is the one I 
dearly prize 
All other gifts above, 
For days and weeks and months go by, 
And still we dearly love.—Cno. 
6 
I'd recommend all single men 
At once to take a 
wife, 
For I 
believe there's nothing half 
So sweet as married life; 
When tired from business you return, 
Refreshed by your wife's charms, 
Your weary feeling is dispelled, 
You clasp her in your arms.—Cno.

Music by SEP. W 1313LER. 
There are friends that we never forget. 
There are hearts that we ever hold dear. 
Tho' we meet with a 
kiss in a 
moment of bliss, 
Yet we part with a 
sigh and a 
tear ; 
Oh we learn our first lesson of love, 
At the home where our childhood is pass'd, 
And we never forget tho' we part with regret, 
The friends of our youth till the last.

There are hearts that we ever hold dear, 
Tho' We meet with a

Yet we part with a

There are friends that we never forget, 
Tho' the sea may divide us for years, 
Yet we linger apart with a 
sorrowing heart, 
In an absence that only endears; 
There are friends that we never forget, 
There are hearts that we ever hold dear, 
The' we find but a 
few. who are earnest and true, 
Yet how sweet is our passing career.

YOU CAN DO IT IF YOU WANT TO. 
Words and Music by GEORGE G. 
Muir.

York. 
Price 10 cents. 
I 
ONCE was deep in love with a 
charming little dear, 
And when in her society I 
always felt so queer, 
I 
muster'd up my cheek, and asked her for a 
kiss, 
She blush'd and hesitated, and answered me like this : 
CITORCS. 
You can do it if you want to, 
For I 
really can't resist you, 
You are such a 
charming fellow, 
To refuse you is absurd. 
As time pass'd on, I 
found I'd have to get a 
wife, 
I 
ask'd her if she'd like to be my better half thro' life ? 
Her answer it was yes, so to papa I 
went, 
And as I'd money plenty, why, he quickly gave consent. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, I 
was pretty well fixed, as I 
asked the " Old 
Gent" for his daughter's hand, heart, and so forth, and he says : 
" 
Well, I've no objection of course; you know " Galatea " hasn't 
any money—but as long as you love her, why, that don't make 
any difference—and as to marrying her, my dear boy, why "— 
You can do it, etc. 
I 
went with rapid steps to tell her of my plan, 
And found her sitting on the lap of a 
handsome looking man, 
I 
scarce believ'd my eyes and started with dismay, 
And as he whispered in her ear, I 
plainly heard her say— 
SPOKEN.—" Never mind, Charley ; even if I 
do marry that 
" 
Snoozer," it won't make any difference, I'll love you just the 
same as ever." 
Jeems-es River I 
wasn't I 
mad— I 
told her sl.e 
was false to me, and that I 
never would marry her— that I 
would 
not believe her even if she'd make a 
statement—and as for her 
" 
Charley," why, he could have her and welcome. I 
told her I 
would leave, and she should rever set eyes on me ariain—and 
" 
I 
hope I 
may never" if she didn't say— 
You can do it, etc. 
The moral of my tale you all can plainly see. 
Dm't marry any old, my boys, tho' handsome she may be, 
Unless she loves but you, I 
ffuess you'll find I'm right, 
They're bound to have a " Charley" when you are out of sight. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, and all I've got to say is, if any of you chaps 
want to marry such a 
girl as that, why— 
You can do it, etc.

TRA LA LA, GEORGE. 
Words and Music by JOSEPH P. 
SE.Ennt. 
My love is youty, and fair and sweet, 
My fancy she can please, 
But 0, she is inclined to flirt 
With every one she sees; 
Whenever she goes out alone 
She's sure to catch a 
beau, 
But then she says it's all for fun, 
And that's no harm, you know. 
I 
want her to be mine, 
And oft I 
tell her so, 
But though she don't decline, 
She wont say yes or no. 
CHORUS. 
Tra la la, George, 
You must go and ask papa, George, 
Tra la la, George, 
You must go and ask papa. George, ha, ha! 
Her father is a 
gruff old man, 
With lots of worldly pelf— 
He says his charming daughter is 
A 
fortune in herself; 
In that, of course, we both agree, 
But when I 
speak about 
Her hand and heart we have to part, 
For he coolly kicks me out ! 
I 
see my love each day, 
She says it is a 
shame; 
What will we do ? I 
say— 
Iler answer is the same— 
Tra la la, George, etc.

I 
still am ever sure to stray 
To that fair maid who plies her trade 
At a 
milliner's store in Broadway. 
One Monday, you know, I 
thought that It go 
To Hoboken just for the day; 
I'll never forget, 'twas there we first met, 
She looked so delighted, so gay; 
Whilst playing at " kiss in the rinv," on the grass, 
Her handkerchief at me she threw; 
She ran, then I 
caught her, I 
brought her safe back 
And kissed her— yaw—yaw—wouldn't you ? 
And wander, etc. 
We chatted, we talked, we quietly walked, 
All Nature's bright beauties to see ; 
With hearty good will we climbed Castle Hill, 
And indulged in a 
ninepenny tea; 
'Twas over this meal the maid did reveal 
Iler sweet occupation in life; 
How I 
prayed that this queen would forsake "the machine," 
And come to my heart as my wife. 
And wander, etc. 
From that very day, I'm delighted to say. 
We loc'd and we coo'd like two doves, 
'Till one lovely ni7ht, when the stars shone bright, 
We told one another our loves ; 
Her parents, she said, agreed we should wed, 
That I 
should have pretty Kathleen ; 
United why we together will be, 
More happy than young king and queen. 
And wander, etc,

Music by J. TANNENBAUM, 
THE band was playing in the park 
One August evening fine, 
And crowds of promenaders gay 
Were marching by in line ; 
The fellows in full force were there, 
The girls were plenty, too, 
And with flirtations, chats, and such, 
All had enough to do. 
cnouus. 
But I 
was harnessed to my love, 
Who now and then would say, 
" 
That lady seems to know you, George, 
Who is she, tell me, pray ?" 
The ladies, bless the gentle doves, 
AU seemed to bow to me, 
Which, with Louisa by my side, 
Did not at all agree ; 
And one, believe it, nudged me hard, 
I 
did not know her name, 
Or even the direction which 
The little damsel came. 
But I 
was, etc. 
I 
told my love that it was rude, 
For we'd ne'er met before, 
And then I 
said, " I'm sure she's not 
The style that I 
adore.'' 
Besides, I 
thought her impudent 
For doing such a 
thing, 
And then the band struck up the air 
My darling loved to sing. 
But I 
was, etc. 
I 
scarce had (rot the sentence out 
When, lo, behold 
there stood 
A 
maiden throwing kisses just 
As fast as e'er she could ; 
She aimed them all at me I 
know, 
For in her roguish eye 
I 
saw ' twas her intention then 
To toss them on the sly. 
(1) 
But I 
was, etc. 
" THAT LADY SEEMS TO KNOW YOU, 
GEORGE ? "—Concluded. 
Apologize again I 
must 
To my Louisa fair, 
Lest she should think that I 
for her 
Did not the slightest care; 
I 
told her jokingly I 
thought 
The kisses flew too high 
For me or any other chap 
To catch them on the fly. 
But I 
was, etc. 
This rather vexed the little one, 
She wanted to go home, 
She was " so tired and sleepy that 
She could no further roam 
But 'ere we reached her domicile, 
A 
girl bewitching sweet, 
Said, as she passed aside us, " George, 
Next Sunday night we meet." 
But I 
was, etc.

Why did you, why did you die ? 
Her lily white hands they were folded, 
A 
rose. red was placed on her breast, 
Her coffin was strewn with camelias 
The day that they laid her to rest ; 
Her sweet, gentle voice, how we miss it, 
And also her kind loving smile, 
Oh, Gertie, forever you've left us, 
Oh, why was it not for a

SHERRY. 
There's many songs been sung of late, 
in praise of various wines. 
Whilst some of other liquors state, 
Most suited to the times. 
In one they sing of Burgundy, 
Which some much love to see, 
For Moselle, Cliquot and Champagne, 
But none of them suit me. 
Sherry ! sherry I

When out at either rout or ball, 
Or if to sup or dine, 
They never trouble me and ask, 
For they-All -know my wine. 
The very best is saved for me, 
The sparkling, dry and pure, 
And in the highest circles I'm 
A well-known connoieseur.

SUNNY smiles and golden tresses, 
Eyes. of tender loving blue; 
Kisses sweet and warm caresses, 
Cheeks of ruby rose's hue. 
Tripping with a 
fairy lightness, 
She was perfect ev'ry way ; 
And our path was lined with brightness 
When together day by day. 
CHORUS. 
Sunny smiles and golden tresses, 
She was perfect every way ; 
Kisses sweet, and warm caresses 
When together day by day. 
Cherry lips, of honeyed sweetness, 
Teeth of richest pearly white, 
Pretty form, that was completeness, 
Love like Luna's gentle light; 
Dancing like a 
summer sunbeam, 
She was happy, kind, and free, 
And our life was like a 
day dream 
When together we would be. 
Sunny smiles, etc. 
Silver voice of softest velvet, 
Neck of alabaster fair, 
Modest as a 
little violet, 
With her flowing golden hair ; 
Rising with the lark at morning, 
She would meet me ev'ry day ; 
But how lonely now the dawning, 
She ; my love; has pass'd away. 
Sunny smiles, etc. 
SOFTLY o'er the rippling waters 
Wander strains of melody, 
Whit the sun in glory dying 
Sinks below the golden sea. 
Echoes on my heart are falling, 
Dreams of other days arise, 
happy dreams of dear ones dwelling 
Far in yonder purple skies. 
Hark, hark, the angels whisper, 
As they dwell in holy power; 
Songs of peace to those that sorrow 
In the twilight's tranquil hour. 
Softly over the rippling waters 
Early stars in beauty shine, 
Lovely ar i's are twining round me, 
Lovely lips are pressing mine, 
Sad, but sweet is memory's vision, 
Sadder still to bid farewell. 
Who would sigh could we but linger, 
Never more to break the spell. 
Hark, hark, etc.

SINCE TERRY SHOOK THE GANG. 
A 
new and original song, written and sung by W ILLIAM SCANLAN, in the 
great Irish sketch, entitled, " Since Terry Shook the Gang," 
as performed by SCANLAN and CRONIN. 
Entered according to Act of Congress in the year 1875, by SCANLAN and 
CRONIN, in the Office ot the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
I'VE just came here before you 
To tell ye who I 
am, 
And about a 
darling son of mine 
Who once did lead a 
gang; 
He was the terror of the neighborhood, 
And the corners where he'd hang, 
But he's taken his father's and mother's advice, 
And entirely shook the gang. 
111 
CHORUS . 
He's working now and he steals no more, 
He's given up all the slang; 
God only knows how proud I 
feel 
Since Terry shook the gang. 
When he came from the Island, 
I 
was as happy as a 
duke; 
He sat down there beside the stove, 
And began to read his book; 
He says, dear father, I'll never go away, 
For I'll never more steal a 
ham ; 
Oh, I've given up all card playing, 
And entirely shook the gang. 
He's working now, etc. 
He goes to church every Sunday now, 
And works then all the week, 
lie stays home in the evening, 
He no longer roams the street; 
He never goes to hops or balls, 
Or strikes the door the oule bang] 
Oh, our hearts are filled with joy, my friends, 
Since Terry shook the gang. 
lie's working now, etc.

RAILWAY GUIDE. 
As sung by JENNIE Henn-
Es, 
I 
HAD fo make a 
journey a 
little while ago, 
Somewhere down the Jersey Central, you must know ; 
A 
splendid-looking man, he was seated by my side, 
He asked me if I 
would lend to him my Railway Guide. 
The man he was troubled with absence of mind, 
The ticket for his journey he had left it far behind, 
He could not recollect the town to which he wished to ride, 
So he begged that I 
would lend to him my Railway Guide. 
SPOKEN. —
Yes, he had actually forgotten the name of the 
town that he wished to travel to. Could only remember that the 
word contained the letter B, M or K. So I 
began to run through 
a 
list of towns whose name contained that letter, such as : 
CELOBI:S. 
Manyunk and Mauchchunk-, 
Neversink and Squadunk, 
There's Peekskill and Fishkill and Catskill beside, 
Weehawken and Hoboken. Binghamton and Stonington, 
He said he'd sure to find it in my Railway Guide. 
Then I 
produced my Appleton, and said to him, " Good man, 
Take the book l'm reading and find it if you can ; " 
He took the volume from my hand and eagerly he tried 
To find the place he wanted in my Railway Guide. 
He searched o'er every leaf. and turned o'er every page, 
Until at last the fellow he got in quite a 
rage, 
He soon turned round to me, and bitterly he cried: 
" 
Dear Miss ! I 
cannot find it in your Railway Guide." 
SPOKEN.— Although he said he had read all throu;h, 
Manyunk and Mauchchunk-, 
etc. 
I 
reached my destination and was going to alight, 
He placed his hand upon my arm, and said with much affright, 
" 
Oh, dear Miss! don't leave me all alone to rid. 
What shall I 
do without you, and your Railway Guide 1" 
Said 1. " Oh no, I'm going down now to my hotel, 
You, sir, cannot walk with me, for it would not look well," 
But he linked Ys arm in mine, and kept marching by my Me, 
He kept a 
firm zrasp on me and my Railway Guide. 
RAILWAY GITIDE.—Continued. 
SPOKEN.—Aucl, said he, if we put our heads together, we 
shall certainly soon discover whether it is 
Manyunk and Mauchchunk, etc. 
He walked with me in silence, some distance on the road, 
I 
knew not how to leave him, when I 
got to my abode ; 
And all that afternoon, the foolish fellow tried, 
To pay attention to me and my Railway Guide; 
And once he plucked up courage and squeezed my little glove 
lie suddenly discovered that he was deep in love; 
le proposed and I 
accepted, I'm soon to be his bride, 
And thus 
gain a 
husband with my Railway Guide. 
SPOKEN.—And he tells me it makes him feel so happy, that 
he don't care if he never arrives either at 
Manyunk and Mauchchunk, etc.

The Music of tbis song is published by G. D. R USSELL & Co., 126 Tremont

THE robin was singing a 
song in the tree, 
The blue birds were twittering near, 
The linnet re-echoed a 
beautiful glee, 
In notes that were mellow and clear ; 
The dew-laden daisies just over the lea 
Had a 
kiss from the radiant sun, 
When Jamie, my lover, came over to me 
And brightened the heart be had won. 
My Jamie was telling a 
tale of the sea, 
His voyage to glittering lands, 
The changes in life since my sailor and me 
First grasp'd one another's brown hands ; 
He told of the fields and the hills far away, 
The skies be had seen in the West, 
When closer I 
drew to his sailor array 
And rested my head on his breast. 
The ocean may rumble and roar on its way, 
The beacon its flittering make, 
The vessels may dance in the foam and the spray, 
And billows may thunder and break ; 
Tho' others may sigh for a 
life on the sea, 
A 
home on the raging abyss, 
:Nly Jamie will never more wander from me, 
My heart is now wedded to his.

Be gob, I 
wasn't worth a 
cint! 
The sate was jist as hard as flint, 
Behind McCarthy's mare. 
CHORUS. 
" 
Hould her in !" McCarthy cried; 
" 
Stop her !" says McCue; 
I 
thought I'd shake to pieces 
As along the road we flew! 
Me head was swimming like a 
top, 
My heart was in despair, 
The divil himself was in the wheels 
Behind McCarthy's mare. 
McCarthy held the reins, 
And Murphy held McCarthy, 
But whiskey filled their brains, 
And made them wild and hearty; 
Maloney tumbled out behind, 
And there we let him lay— 
Sure I 
offered to assist him, 
But the mare she ran away. 
Off she whit ! off she wint 
Be gob, I 
wasn't worth a 
cint! 
The sate was jist as hard as flint, 
Behind McCarthy's mare. 
" 
Hould her in !" etc.

THE RUNAWAY MARE.— Concluded. 
Me dacent coat was tore, 
Me hat was left behind me; 
I 
rattled and I 
swore, 
And I 
thought the dust would blind me; 
In holes and ditches wint the wheels-
0, murther! such a 
day! 
Sure mesilf was kilt intirely, 
With the mare that run away. 
Off she wint! off she wint! 
Be gob, I 
wasn't worth a 
cint! 
The sate was jist as hard as flint, 
Behind McCarthy's mare.

SEE how fast from heaven, mother, 
Fall the featli'ry flakes of snow, 
Weaving white and pure a 
mantle 
For the fruitful earth below; 
Ere they melt I'll leave you, mother. 
Leave for e'er this world of pain; 
Something tells me I 
shall never 
See the summer flow'rs again. 
CHORUS. 
Do not weep, dear loving mother, 
Sad am I 
to cause you pain; 
But something tells me I 
shall never 
See the summer flow'rs again. 
How I 
lov'd alone to wander 
In the happy days long flown, 
O'er field and meadow fair, to gather 
Bright-hued blossoms freshly blown; 
Soon beside the rippling river, 
Winding onward o'er the plain. 
The buds will burst, but I 
shall never 
See the summer ilow'rs again. 
Do not weep, etc.

PULLMAN CAlt. 
Words by ALFRED H UDSON. Music by CHAS. J. 
arms& 
PRAY give me your attention, 
Some facts to you I'll mention 
About a 
dear, bewitching girl 
I 
met the other day ; 
'Twos in the hours of leisure, 
While travelling just for pleasure, 
5lie came walking through a 
Pullman Car, 
And looked so sweet and gay— 
CHOLTS. 
Riding in a 
Pullman Car. 
Whilst riding in a 
Pullman Car, 
A 
girl she passed me by, 
And winked at me so sly, 
Whilst riding in a 
Pullman Car. 
Riding in, etc. 
As I 
alone was sitting, 
She through the car came flitting; 
I 
watched her with enraptured gaze, 
As she was tripping by, 
My heart was gone completely, 
Her eyes they beamed so sweetly— 
I 
smiled at her, she smiled at me, 
And then she winked her eye. 
Riding in, etc. 
At last we reached the station, 
Which was our destination; 
I 
lost sight of the pretty girl, 
Who stole my heart away; 
But soon I 
mean to find her, 
And then I 
will remind her, 
About -that small flirtation 
We had the other day. 
Riding in, etc.

MT 
name is Roger O'Malley, understand, 
And don't begin for to doubt me; 
I 
own my own house, and a 
bit o' land, 
There's no common stock about me. 
I 
went to college when a 
boy, 
And left with heaps of lore ; 
And came out here to this free land, 
Just pravious to the war. 
CHORUS. 
Roger O'Malley, that's my name, 
Quite famous I 
have grown ; 
Pm far superior to Muldoon, 
Mulcahy, or Malone. 
I'm quite independent in my way, 
High-ton'd and well educated; 
All my taxes I'm ready for to nay, 
And I'm not in the least dissipated. 
I 
can take a 
drink, and smoke a 
cigar, 
With comfort and delight; 
But you'll never see me loafin' round 
The whiskey bars at night 
Roger O'Malley, etc, 
Pm as dacent a 
man as you can find, 
Like all my seven generations ; 
With a 
good deal of larnin' in my mind, 
Which I 
use on important occasions; 
I'm far above yer common scraps, 
That fling their names all round. 
And they'll not catch me in any trap; 
For I'm sensible and sound. 
Roger O'Malley, etc. 
I'm a 
marshal whenever we parade, 
I 
ride a 
horse from Araby; 
With a 
big stick of honor in my hand, 
Sure, in martial affairs I'm no baby. 
I 
ate my fill, and wear good clothes, 
Made up in the style you see; 
My walk is grand, and plainly shows 
That there's no such man as me I

Of poor old Uncle Ben.

Poor old Uncle Ben 
Is now among the blest ; 
He used to take us on his knee, 
And sing us all to rest; 
But now we are alone. 
We'll never see again 
Around de little cabin door 
Our dear old Uncle Ben. 
He used to roam de cotton fields, 
And help to mow de hay. 
And down de river glide along 
Wid heart so light and gay ; 
De old plantation was his home, 
AMOIlf2; de fields of corn : 
'Twas in de old Kentucky State 
Where Uncle Ben was born. 
Poor old Uncle Ben, etc. 
Dere was no darkey round de place 
Dat massa loved so well ;

While his stories he would tell ; 
De children danc'd around his feet, 
And all was gladness then ; 
But now they plant sweet roses on 
The grave of Uncle Ben.

I 
KNOW a 
little girl, 
The best in all the world; 
Her equal is not living in the land! 
I 
see her eviry day, 
My pretty Kitty May, 
And when we meet I 
squeeze her little hand I 
Oh! how she makes me sigh! 
She's just as sweet as pie ! 
O 
pretty Kitty May, 
So charming and so gay; 
Her equal is not living in the land ; 
She says she will be mine-
O 
happiness divine ! 
For me she wears a 
ring upon her hand. (
Dance.) 
She's worth her weight in gold, 
And lovely to behold; 
Her smile of love, so gentle and serene, 
Shines o'er me like the sun. 
And will when we are one; 
0, won't she be a 
perfect little queen. 
Oh, how she makes me sigh 
She's just as sweet as pie ! 
O pretty Kitty May, 
So charming and so gay; 
Her equal is not living in the land ; 
She says she will be mine-
0, happiness divine! 
For me she wears a 
ring upon her hand. (
Dnace.) 
No voice can sing as sweet, 
No form can look so neat; 
I 
know no gladness when we are apart; 
I 
wish the weary day 
To fly with wings away, 
That I 
may press her fondly to my heart! 
Oh, how she makes me sigh ! 
She's just as sweet as pie! 
O 
pretty Kitty May, • 
So charming and so gay; 
Her equal is not living in the land; 
She says she will be mine-
0, happiness divine! 
For me she wears a

PAY FOR THE LAST ROUND. 
A IR.—" Wait till the Moonlight." 
DOWN in the Fourth Ward on a 
pleasant little corner, 
I 
compliment myself I 
own a 
liquor store; 
It is not a 
place like where Jack Horner 
Eat his Christmas pudding, but a 
far superior place. 
It is not a 
cafe—it is not a 
palace, 
It is not a 
dew drop inn, or any such a 
place ; 
We are not at all gallus—we do not take taffy, 
But always look a 
man square in the face. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, I 
have a 
fine saloon now. 
But I 
have a 
great 
time with the young fellows that frequent my saloon. 
A man 
came in the other day and asked for a 
kerosene cock- tail. 
Says I, " Maybe you want a 
coal- oil lamp punch 7" 
Says he, 
" 
I'll punch you, if you come out from behind the bar." 
Says 
I, " Me young stripling, if I 
walk around there and hit you with 
my left hand, I 
will fell you like an ox." 
Says he back then 
to me, " You have too much chin tbr a 
terrier ;" and says I, 
" 
Yon have too much lip for a 
bull pup." But he sat down and 
called for a 
glass of porter. 
He didn't pay for it, and when he 
called for another, says I— 
Pay for the last round, that's what you called for, 
Then you can have anything you want; 
But until you do, sir, the next one you call for, 
I 
will bet you five dollars you'll get the bounce. 
My wife was a 
German before we were married, 
Her name it was Katrina, or something of the kind; 
We live about as quiet— we never do get flurried, 
She's a thoroughbred you can bet your life, and I 
am glad 
she's mine. 
She is not a 
dandy, or a 
cologne water daisy, 
She's very neat and hardy is my mistress Jane O'Boyle; 
We are a 
couple to admire, if you knew her you would say, 
We don't set the world on fire, but always pay our way. 
EN.—Last week I 
took in some boarders, and T 
have had 
no peace since. 
One was a 
circus actor, and he took the feath-
er bed in the cellar, and be heavens he commenced practising 
pyramids on it. 
The other was a 
Negro actor, and done noth-
ing but yah yah here, and yah yah there. 
When I 
asked him 
his name, says he, " I 
am Cully, the cutter !" and I 
hear since 
(1) 
127 
PAY FOR THE LAST ROUND.—Concluded. 
it is Jimmy Rodgers. 
Divil the cent of board have they paid 
since they came. 
The other morning I 
told them not to be so 
familiar with the butter, that there was good molasses on the 
table. Says they, " Oh, shoot the molasses !" Says I, " Don't do 
that ;" and when the meat is put on the table, they make a 
glam 
at the lean and leave the fat for the other boarders. 
But I 
will 
get rid of the boarders as quick as I 
can, and start a 
lunch 
bar. 
I 
asked my wife the other day if she liked oysters'? 
She 
said ",The only oyster she ever ate was a 
clam, and it made her 
sick." 
But you can bet any man comes in my saloon only 
cheats me once, for I 
say— 
Pay for the last round, etc. 
IRISH BLADES. 
Sung by MUMPHY and MORTON. 
WERE two roving blades from old Killarney. 
And the pretty colleens call us bouncing Barneys; 
We're the Irish boys can tip to them the blarney, 
And dear old Paddy's Land, that's our home, do you mind; 
Just a 
few years ago we took a 
notion 
For to take a 
trip across the briny ocean; 
Our hearts were all in a 
commotion, 
Since we left that little isle so far away, do you mind. 
CHORUS. 
For we are ever bright and gay, singing, dancing all the day, 
This caubeen of a 
hat we're ever wearing, 
Although we are from our homes afar, 
Our hearts are ever there; 
No land we'll ever see can ever wean 
Our love from dear old Ireland. 
When we landed in Columbia's nation, 
Among the girls we caused a 
great sensation; 
We're the happiest Irish pair that's in the nation, 
And dear old Paddy's land that's our home, do you mind; 
When at night the bright eyes are glancing, 
For the colleens fair you will always see us dancing, 
We are two Irish boys that's always fond of prancing, 
And to please you sure that is our aim. 
• For we are, etc.

OLD TIME'S ROCKS. 
Banjo Solo sung by BILLY W

The way we travel now-a-days, 
Surprises us with its different ways. 
In Chicago they go it by pitch and toss, 
You can jump off for ten minutes 
And:get a 
Divorce. 
CHORUS. 
Then it's old Time's Rocks is number one, 
Oh how is that for High. 
The Telegraph workers are on a 
strike, 
The way things are working 
They don't seem to like. 
The last message thy sent I 
think was a 
stunner, 
To fight it out on one wire if it took all summer. 
Then it's, &c. 
Oh, Fisk, the Erie Prince, is pie, 
He's always exclaiming, " How's that for high?' 
I 
hear from Alaska he's buying upbears. 
But in Jersey they've snatched him 
For raising the fares. 
Then it's, (tc. 
The Mormons they have had a 
flare, 
Each other's opinions to pieces they tear. 
Brigham Young still coos like an old turtle dove. 
Says he's coming on North, 
To go in for free love.

When we marched in the procession on last St. Patrick's day, 
And oh, such music, such music, such music as we had all day, 
Such music, such music, how sweet the bands did play. 
Hugh Maginnis was chief marshal and he rode a 
fine white horse, 
With a 
sword and sash beside him, oh! boys he was the boss! 
With a 
smile on every feature, and a 
uniform so gay, 
The ladies all smiled on him as we marched along the way, 
And oh, such winking, such winking, such winking as was 
there that day, 
Such winking, such winking, they winked the livelong day. 
'Twas just below the common we fell into the line, 
With flags and banners flying, the day being nice and fine, 
The band played Garry Owen and then the Mulligan Guard ; 
Arid we carried the harp of Erin beside the stripes and stars. 
And oh, such tramping, such tramping, such tramping as was 
there that day, 
Such tramping, such tramping all through the mud and clay. 
When we marched in open order faith ' twould make you laugh 
to see 
The little stick leg cripple keeping step with Mick Magee; 
When we come before the marshal's house they brought us to 
a 
halt, 
And they gave us just ten minutes for to go and get our malt. 
And oh, such whiskey, such whiskey, such whiskey as was 
drank that day, 
Such whiskey, such whiskey, the bar-rooms made it pay. 
Then when we were disbanded as quick as you could wink 
We all bounced down to Kelley's for to have a 
drop to drink, 
The whiskey punch flew lively for the liquor was so rare, 
In less than fifteen minutes divil a 
sober man was there. 
And oh, such drinking, such drinking, such drinking as was 
there that night, 
Such drinking, such drinking, the boys got awful tight. 
Mike Connors and Pat Cronin then got into a 
dispute, 
Mike said his hat was finest, and Pat slapped him on the snoot, 
Then broken heads were plenty, the blood ran freely there, 
Myself and. long Dan Carty had to waltz off on our ear. 
And oh, such fighting, such fighting, such fighting as the boys 
had there, 
Such fighting, such fighting, ' twas like an Irish fair.

I 
TOOK a 
stroll the other night, 
To see my sweetheart fair, 
When underneath an awning wide 
I 
spied sweet auburn hair ; 
The wearer was a 
charming miss, . 
So, her good graces to win, 
I 
raised my hat, when she replied, 
" 
Oh, Nixey, that's too thin." 
CHORUS. 
Oh, wasn't it a 
cruel act ? 
Oh, wasn't it a 
sin, 
To treat me so by saying thus, 
" 
Oh, Nixey, that's too thin." 
Of course I 
felt the sad reproach, 
But wandered on awhile, 
When soon I 
was accosted with 
A 
most bewitching smile ; 
Her kindness to reciprocate, 
I 
gave my killing grin, 
But oh, she hollered out aloud, 
" 
Oh, Nixey, that's too thin." 
Oh, wasn't it, etc. 
Determined to proceed along, 
And let the girls alone, 
I 
soon was met by one, who said 
Her " hubby dear had flown ;" 
She grasped me tightly by the arm, 
And asked me for the `• tin," 
But on refusing her, she said, 
" 
Oh, Nixey, that's too thin." 
Oh, wasn't it, etc. 
At last I 
reached my Dora's house, 
The clock was striking ten, 
She from the attic window cried, 
" 
My dear, where have you been 'I" 
(

133 
OH, NIXEY, THAT'S TOO THIN."—Concluded. 
" 
To walk, my love," I 
kindly said, 
" 
To walk with cousin Min ;" 
She slammed the window down and said, 
" 
Oh, Nixey, that's too thin." 
Oh, wasn't it, etc. 
Now, gentlemen, take my advice, 
And pass all " cousins " by, 
Unless you have a 
splendid chance 
To meet them on the sly. 
These ladyloves that fellows have 
All know what they're about, 
And if you're " going back on them," 
They'll surely find you out. 
Oh, wasn't it, etc.

Willi' warble so sweetly, my dear little bird'? 
Why perch on that branch all the day'? 
Are you singing for baby your prettiest song, 
Or is it a 
funeral lay'? 
From morn until night your sweet carol we hear 
O'er baby's grave, darling, our own; 
'Tis kind in you, birdie, but baby's asleep,

'Tis kind in you, birdie, but baby's asleep,

Why carol so lovely, my nice little bird'? 
Why rest on that branch all the time `? 
You ought to be flying far South long ere this, 
'Tis a 
brighter and sunnier clime; 
But no, you prefer to watch o'er baby's grave, 
And give us your song of sweet tone, 
But baby don't hear you, the darling's asleep, 
Our Sweet little rosebud has flown.

'TB strange how fellows now and then 
Stare in a 
lady's face, 
When she walks out to take the air, 
Or shopping place from place ; 
There's one I've met quite frequently, 
His manners they are free, 
He smiles whene'er I 
pass him by, 
" 
Oh, ain't he sweet oD me !" 
CHORUS. 
Oh, yes, he is, indeed! yes, be is 
Completely gone, I 
see ; 
And fifty times a 
day I 
say, 
" 
Oh, ain't he sweet on we." 
I 
meet him every morning most, 
And in the afternoon 
He's sure to pass me, feeling just 
As big as a 
balloon; 
He fixes up regardless of 
Expense, indeed does he, 
He smokes a 
pure Havana, too, 
" 
Oh, ain't he sweet on me." 
Oh, yes he is, etc. 
The other night, when cousin Jule 
And I 
were out to ride, 
We saw a 
fellow driving fast, 
Who soon was by our side; 
He bowed to us politely, and 
As nice as nice could be, 
And then he gave a 
cunning wink, 
" 
Oh, ain't he sweet on me." 
Oh, yes he is, etc. 
Last Monday afternoon as I 
Was passing down the street, 
I 
dropped my pocket- handkerchief 
Beside a 
fellow's feet ; 
He quickly picked the linen up, 
And cried, " there is no fee," 
While I 
stood gazing at the chap 
That is so sweet on me. 
Oh, yes he is, efe.

To have a

Why, also try and have like me,

Don't always just agree,

Its bright rolling rivers, its lakes and its rills ; 
Its meadows of clover, its woodland and glades, 
Its warm, sunny pastures, and cool forest shades ; 
Come back to its orchards, its glens, and its vales,

Come back to New England, where sweetest of girls 
Are roaming and dancing in ringlets and curls ; 
Where rosy and lily cheek'd maidens are seen, 
O'erflowing with frolic, polite as a 
queen ; 
Come back to its pie-ides, its parties and balls, 
Its pure social meetings in parlors and halls ; 
Come go to its harvest, its husking and all, 
Come back to New England, come answer our call. 
Come back, etc. 
Come back to New England, the pride of our land, 
Where all are received with a 
grasp of the hand ; 
Where hearts that are honest, aq,d faithful, and true, 
Are anxiously waiting a 
welcome to you ; 
Come back to the homestead all nestled in vines, 
The home where the hop and the green ivy twines ; 
Come back ' neath the roof that once sheltered thee long, 
Come back to New England, the land of sweet song. 
Come back, etc.

Now don't be sorrowful, darling, 
And don't be sorrowful pray, 
Taking the year together, my dear, 
There isn't more night than day; 
'Tis rainy weather, my darling, 
Time's waves they heavily run, 
But taking the year together, my dear, 
There isn't more cloud than sun. 
We are old folks, my darling, 
Our heads are growing grey, 
But taking the year all round, my &

You will always find the May; 
We have had our May, my darling, 
And our roses long ago, 
And the time of the year is coming, my dear, 
For the silent night and snow.

An Irish Song and Dance by JOHN THOMPSON. 
I 
wAs born long ago in the sweet county Monaghan, 
In the middle of a 
bog, I 
never will get on again, 
The Shamrock, the ship that I 
over here came sailing in, 
With those big blackguards of sailors all a 
pumpin' and 
bailin' in ; 
Across the seas for ninety days, 
With yellow meal and butter milk, 
Musha bathershin-na-bocklish 
I'm sportin' Mollie, 0 ! (
Dance.) 
It's when I 
left old Ireland my patience it was taxin' 0! 
A 
nate lock of my bright red hair sure every one was axin' 0! 
They all set up a 
hullabaloo, the gossoons and the colleen 
bawns, 
To leave the pigs and praties with the fairies and the leper-
acauns; 
To cross the seas for ninety days, 
With yellow meal and buttermilk, 
Musha bather-shin-na-bocklish, 
I'm sportin' Mollie, 0 ! (
Dance.) 
I'm goin' to settle down when I 
get a 
bit of property, 
As large as any bog in shweet Shlather-Mac-O'Dougherty, 
I'll efo in for women's rights when here I 
am a 
resident, 
I-11 be an alderwoman then or else a 
faymale president. 
SPOKEN.—Then bad luck to me if ever I— 
Cross the seas for ninety days. 
With yellow meal and buttermilk, 
Musha bather-shin-na-bocklish, 
I'm sportin' Mollie 0 !

MULCAHY'S SISTER KATE. 
AIR.—"I'lulcahy's Gone Away." 
Yon have heard them sing of a 
hero bold, 
Mulcahy was his name, 
And, faith, he had a 
sister too, 
Was noted for her fame; 
She was chief cook in a 
boarding house, 
And at making hash was great; 
She came from the County Dynegole, 
And her maiden name was Kate. 
She is tall and thin, 
With her crooked shin; 
Her cheeks was red, and so was the head 
Of Mulcahy's sister Kate. 
She treats me like a 
lady 
When her I 
go to see; 
She takes me into the kitchen, 
And treats me to cake and tea, 
And ofttimes I 
used to sit until 
It was very late, 
And whispiring my love story to 
Mulcahy's sister Kate. 
She is tall, etc, 
I 
thought she was an angel 
When I 
kept her company; 
But in the course of time I 
found 
That she was fooling me, 
I 
went to her house one night, 
And standing by the gate, 
I 
saw a 
greasy soapfat man 
A-hugging my darling Kate. 
She is tall, etc.

W HEN the autumn leaves are falling 
From the locust near the mill, 
I'll be waiting ' neath the branches 
Just at eight, when all is still ; 
You will come, I 
know, my darling, 
With your smiling face so fair, 
For as true as star-beams glisten, 
Josie, I 
will meet you there.

Josie, darling, sweet Josie, darlina, 
Thou art beautiful and fair; 
Just as true as star-beams glisten,

There we often met in summer, 
When the cunning whipporwill 
Mingled with the gentle mu,ie 
Of the little muem'rina nil; 
Softly to my bosom, darling, 
I 
have held you oft of yore, 
Telling sweet and loving stories 
That you used to then adore. 
Josie, darling, etc. 
Soon the winter snows will cover 
Pleasant spots where we have met, 
So. when autumn leaves are falIin-a, 
Darling Josie, don't foraet; 
Underneath that ancient locust 
I 
will look for you, my dear, 
For this life is sweetest to me, 
Josie, love, when you are near.

I COME with news to-night, me boys, 
Just heed me for awhile; 
My song will give delight, me boys, 
For it makes rue grin and smile; 
You've heard about that famous man 
Who left us all in pain ; 
Sure, he's back at last all safe and sound— 
Mulcahy's home again! 
CHORUS. 
Then shout, and cheer, and drink yer beer, 
No more in grief remain ; 
For now the cry is ey'rywhere, 
Mulcahy's home again 
I 
met him down in Chambers street 
A 
week ago to-day; 
And when I 
shook his friendly hand, 
Sure, I 
thought I'd faint away ! 
He's big and stout, and walks about 
In dress both nate and clane; 
Says I 
with glee, " 0, can this be 
Mulcahy home again ? " 
Then shout, etc. 
I 
axed him why he strayed away, 
And left us all behind.; 
But divil a 
word would he reply 
To satisfy me mind ; 
lie may have lived in foreign lands— 
In Jarsey, or in Spain; 
But none will care from whence he came, 
When he's home with us again. 
Then shout, etc. 
He talks no more of politics— 
He says he's had enough; 
To stand their capers and their tricks 
One must be bold and tonolt! 
He thinks he'll start a 
corner store, 
And paint a 
sign so plain, 
To greet us when we reach the door— 
" 
Mulcaby's Home Again!"

You'll always find me in it, 
Wid me darling old stick—I 
lay 'em out thick 
And settle 'em in a 
minit. 
Whenever I 
get in a 
row 
I 
tell you there's no tooling, 
For I'm the coon— that learns 'em soon, 
To keep clear of Larry Dooling. 
'Twas on the other night 
I 
started out all right, 
To go—that's so— 
To the wake of Teddy More. 
And there we all got tight, 
And soon kicked up a 
fight. 
And blood— like a 
flood— 
Was flying on the floor. 
Whenever, &c. 
McGinnis struck Muldoon 
hich laid him out right soon, 
Wid me stick—Dublin Dick— 
I 
piumneled well, I 
vow. 
MeGaden called for peace, 
Onairety bawled " polieee," 
And they come—on a 
run— 
And quickly stopped the row. 
Whenever, &c.

And our darlings are asleep, 
Then we pry into the chamber 
Just to take a

On the soft and snowy pillow 
Rests a

And we kiss that priceless treasure— 
Little face above the spread.

When the busy day has left us, 
And the weary hours have fled, 
There is happiness in kissing 
Little face above the spread. 
Hands that all the day were busy, 
Now are quiet for the night, 
And the weary feet are resting

On joyous scenes of yore; 
The merry boys and girls at play 
Around the cottage door. 
I 
see the mossy, winding wall, 
The meadow, brook, and pool; 
But sweetest vision of them all, 
The lane that led to school. 
CHORUS. 
I 
see again the winding wall, 
The meadow, brook, and pool; 
But sweetest vision of them all, 
The lane that led to school. 
The birds are sinning just as sweet 
Upon the chestnut-boughs, 
The youthful lovers, as they meet, 
Exchange the olden vows; 
I 
see the fields in verdant gown, 
And feel the breezes cool, 
That used to blow so gently down 
The lane that led to school. 
I 
see again, etc. 
The woods are ringing far and near 
With shouts of boyish glee ; 
The girlish voices that I 
hear 
Renew sweet youth in me; 
hear the old familiar song, 
And see the crippled stool, 
While in my dreams I 
walk along 
The lane that led to school.

She aave me at the gate 
One evening fine in summer time, 
As it was arowing late. 
She said that we mast separate 
That night, and never more 
Should 
escort her out to walk, 
Or cross her cottage door. 
I'll ne'er forget the parting kilts 
She aave me at the gate; 
It shattered my once manly heart, 
My grief I 
can't relate. 
I 
asked her why she acted so, 
And pleaded, but in vain, 
For her to stop her foolish talk 
And not say that aaain ; 
She only langh'd. and quickly said,

PITY PETER POPPYTOP.--[CoNcurDED.1 
In youth I 
tasted every sham, 
The oil they call the " Castor," 
The powder placed in currant jam, 
The lively mustard plaster; 
Full often I 
with mouth awry 
Brimstone and treacle swallowed, 
I 
daren't complain for then the cane 
And salts and senna followed. 
SPOKEN.— Every body was down on me then, it's very hard— 
Cno.—Oh I 
people, &c. 
My thrashings still make me turn pale, 
Whenever they are mentioned, 
('Twas something very like a 
weal 
To call them well intentioned) ; 
And through a 
lapse of many years 
I 
still can recollect who 
Threw snowballs into both my ears 
Which trickled down my neck too. 
SPOIKEN.—Every body was down on Peter, it's very hard— 
Cno.—Oh people, &e. 
I 
thought some money might be made 
By selling silk umbrellas, 
So bought an " old established" trade 
Of two good-natured fellows ; 
I 
couldn't make the business pay, 
There never was such weather, 
We didn't get a 
rainy day 
For quite six months together. 
SPOKEN.—Every body was down on me but the rain, that 
wouldn't come down; it's very hard— 
Cno.—Oh I 
people, &e. 
My fortune in the betting ring 
Was like my other ventures, 
I 
nearly squandered every thing 
In some railway debentures. 
My courting, too, turned out a 
do, 
For Sue, my love deriding, 
Got married to a 
fellow who 
Gave me a 
dreadful hiding.

LITTLE rosebud, are you lonely 
Now I 
am so far away 
For of you I'm thinking only, 
As I 
ever sadly stray; 
Since from you I 
sweetly parted 
Earth has no delights for me, 
And I 
wander, heavy hearted, 
O'er the land and o'er the sea. 
CHORUS. 
Little rosebud, are you lonely 
Now I 
am so far away 7 
For of you I'm thinking only 
As I 
ever sadly stray. 
Little rosebud, I 
am coming 
home to see you once again; 
For I'm weary now of roaming, 
Drifting o'er the stormy main ; 
Will you welcome home the ranger 
To the sunshine of your smile 'I 
Then shall sadness be a 
stranger, 
And life's sweetest joys beguile.

THEY bore him away when day had fled, 
And the storm was rolling high, 
And they laid him down in his lonely bed, 
By the light of an angry sky; 
The lightning flasli'd and the wild sea lashed 
The shore with its foaming waves ; 
And the thunder pass'd on the rushing blast 
As it howl'd o'er the rover's grave, 
And the thunder pass'd on the rushing blast, 
As it howl'd o'er the rover's grave. 
No longer for him, like a 
fearless bird, 
Yon bark floats under the lee; 
No longer his voice on the gale is heard, 
When its guns peal over the sea; 
But near him the white gull builds on high 
Her nest by the gleaming wave ; 
And the heaving billows groan and die 
On the sands of the rover's grave, 
And the heaving billows groan and die 
On the sands of the rover's grave.

MY 
parents are wealthy and live in style 
In a 
mansion of their own; 
They dote upon me, and if faults they see 
They will never make them known. 
Some chide me and say in a 
gentle way, 
" 
You must change your careless ways ;" 
But it ne'er can be done, for while life is mine, 
I'm the boy that's bound to blaze. 
Bound to blaze, bound to blaze, bound to blaze. 
CHORUS. 
I'm the boy that's bound to blaze; 
While I'm living I 
must be gay; 
My pa is rich, and my inn don't care, 
And I'm bound to blaze away. 
They say I'm so naughty ! the girls I 
mean, 
But they only speak in fun; 
They know what a 
man of the world I'm am, 
And the hearts I've lost and won. 
I'll do as I 
please, understand, my boys; 
Let the world give scorn or praise ; 
For evil or good I 
will be a 
blood— 
I'm the boy that's bound to blaze. 
I'm the boy, etc. 
I 
know all the sports, and the sports know me, 
And I'm welcomed everywhere; 
I 
handle the " ribbons " so wild and free 
All the people stop and stare. 
I 
drive thro' the Park when the day is bright, 
With my pair of shining bays; 
Sensation is ever my heart's delight, 
And I'm always bound to blaze. 
I'm the boy, etc. 
I 
go to the races and bet my pile, 
Win or lose, it's all the same, 
For when you're in Rome you must feel at home, 
Never mind the future blame. 
Sometimes I 
awake with a 
great headache, 
And my fancy backwards strays ; 
"No matter," I 
say ; " this is just the way 
When a 
fellow's bound to blaze." 
I'm the boy, etc.

Although you held me by the hand, 
And then began to cry, 
I 
started for a 
far off land, 
I 
could not say good-bye. 
I 
could not, etc.

I'LL go back to Erin, to Erin, dear Barney, 
I'm sighing, my dearest, for one glance at you ; 
I 
long for the home of the dear little shamrock, 
The mountain and meadow that sparkle with dew. 
Since last I 
beheld you my heart has been weary, 
I've thought of you, darling, by night and by day; 
And often in dreams I 
have tried to caress you, 
And you, my dear Barney, so far, far away. 
CHORUS . 
Ah I 
I'll go back to Erin, to Erin, dear Barney, 
I 
cannot, I 
cannot no longer delay; 
I 
long for the home of the dear little shamrock, 
And, Barney, my love, I'll be soon on the way. 
I'll go back to Erin, to Erin, dear Barney, 
I'm longing for you and those bright auburn curls; 
I 
sigh for the scenes of the past in our village, 
The valleys, the rivers, and rosy-check'd girls. 
The lakes of Killarney are shining before me, 
Their sweet, placid waters are bright as of yore ; 
And often I 
think I 
am walking beside you, 
And talking of love by the lake's pleasant shore. 
Ah! I'll go back, etc, 
rll go back to Erin, to Erin, dear Barney, 
So, darling, be ready to welcome me there ; 
I 
look for the day when we'll fix for the wedding, 
The marriage that makes us the happiest pair. 
The lark and the cuckoo will greet my arrival, 
The nightingale, too, will respond with a 
lay; 
And Barney, remember, be ready to meet me, 
For Barney, my love, 
be soon on the way. 
Ah 
go back, etc.

COME, hush-a-by, clearest of dears! 
Ahl what's to become of poor me 7 
I've only been married two years, 
And this little chap's number three. 
If at such an astonishing rate 
Our family's always increased, 
Its clearly our terrible fate 
To have twenty-seven at least. 
CHORUS. 
Come, old fellow, mayhaps, if you'll swallow your pap, 
Your mind less excited may be ; 
And, ray dear little chap, if you won': take a 
nap, 
Whatever's: to happen to me .7 
He's a' fine little fellow, of course— 
Now, don't begin kicking, I 
beg— 
Such lungs, and as strong as a 
horse— 
There, that's pretty well for a 
leg. 
Beef, bread and potatoes are dear. 
But babies uncommonly cheap; 
The worst of this little one here 
Is somehow, he won't go to sleep. 
Come, old fellow, etc. 
Jane's sn..—just listen to that— 
While I 
shiver out in the cold; 
I'll wake her, and give her the brat— 
But 110! she might happen to scold.

That marriage is quite a 
mistake. 
Come, old fellow, etc. 
Come, hush-a-by, there's a 
good child, 
The clock's striking three, what a 
fix! 
I'm getting uncommonly wild— 
They're going to call me at six! 
Of getting the ghost of a 
nap 
My chances appear rather blue; 
Mild measures have failed, so, old chap, 
try what a 
slapping will do. 
Come, old fellow, etc. 
Stop howling— be quiet, you wretch! 
The neighbors are sure to complain; 
Shut up, or a 
bobby I'll fetch— 
Thieves—murder—fre—pick-pockets—Jane! 
I 
tell you I'm losing my head; 
I'm chilled to the marrow right through. 
And now, ma'am, I'm going to bed— 
Here take him, and sit on him, do! 
CE

Oh! he won't drink his pap, and he won't take a 
nap, 
And the clock's struck a 
quarter- past- three, 
And I 
don't care a 
rap if you throttle the chap, 
So long as you take him from me.

OF 
all the pretty little blondes 
That ever walked the stage, 
There's one, I'll call her Nellie, 
She's the beauty of the age; 
She is petite in stature 
And as lively as a 
witch, 
And her back is ornamented 
With a 
golden swinging switch. 
CH.OBUS. 
The first time that I 
met her 
She wore a 
swinging switch, 
This beautiful, this charming girl, 
This pretty little witch. 
Her smile it is angelic, and 
Her manners are serene, 
Her teeth of pearly whiteness 
Are the nicest I 
have seen; 
Her voice at times is mellow, 
Again its pure and rich, 
But the sweetest thing about her 
Is what golden swinging switch. 
The first time, ete. 
She skips before the footlights with 
An air of grace and ease, 
She sinas like a 
canary, 
And is always sure to please; 
Admirers, they are many, 
They applaud the little witch, 
And when she gets an encore, then 
Oh don't she toss the switch.

With our new flags flying so gay, 
And bate the time wid both our feet, 
While the band did sweetly play;

And they smil'd at the Pioneers, 
And then their handkerchiefs they shook, 
At the Hoolahan Musketeers.

And faith, we gave three hearty cheers 
For the officers and the men, 
In the Hoolaban Musketeers!

MONEY'S SOON 
PARTED." 
Written and composed by G. W. 11tiNT. 
Sung by G. II. lliCDERMOTT. 
You'LL excuse my appearing in this shabby lot, 
But the garments I 
wear are the best I 
have got; 
They once were the fashion, as smart as e'er worn, 
..\--ota fit for a 
scarecrow, all tattered and torn ; 
Just three years ago I 
came in for some cash, 
Like others before me—" went in " for " the dash!" 
I 
lived like a 
lord, the lot soon did spend, 
A 
short tho' a 
merry time— this is the end. 
CHORUS. 
Ah! once I 
bad cash, then I 
was rash— 
Cut such a 
dash— soon went to smash ; 
Now you may see I'm all up a 
tree, 
Yes, fools and their money's soon parted. 
I 
then used to toddle to ball-room or rout, 
If I 
now showed my nose they'd no doubt turn me out, 
And those I've befriended in sunshiny day, 
_Naze give me the cut, or pass over the way; 
This hat I 
have doffed to many a 
fair maid, 
_You, the brim wouldn't stand it, of the roof I'm afraid, 
And these gloves, ahem ! Dent's best, once fit for a 
don, 
Now there's no kid about '
em, I 
can scarce keep 'ern on. 
Yes, once I 
had, etc. 
I'd a 
gold- headed cane which I'd—my—flourish about, 
But it's some time ago since that went—up the spout ; 
An eye- glass which an air of importance would lend, 
Long ago I—for 8,1fety left that with a 
friend!

i‘ FOOLS AND THEIR MONEY'S SOON 
PARTED."—Concluded. 
In a 
hansom I'd then travel thro' many a 
s.reet, 
.Icow I 
tramp it not handsome about my poor feet; 
These boots once such a 
fit, of the best patent leather, 
They scarce now can body and sole keep together. 
Ah, once I 
had, etc. 
This sleeve still for me possesses a 
charm, 
When I 
think of the darlings I've had on my arm ; 
Yes, this coat it could tell a 
good tale I 
believe, 
But one tail I 
find's given notice to leave; 
The wind thro' my Sydenhams often will steal, 
And nothing but holes in their pockets I 
feel ; 
They've clung to me Yell, so I'll still bold them dear, 
Tho' to- day I 
discovered a 
rent—in the rear! 
Ah, once I 
had, etc. 
And as for the garment. I 
wear next my skin, 
To be severity with that, after years would be sin ; 
I 
could once " sport my linen " so spotlessly white, 
But now I 
am thinking it's best out of sight ! 
So, boys, should some cash ever come in your way, 
Stick to it in case of the rainy day; 
Take care of yourself and don't be too free. 
Or some morning you'll find yourself right up a 
tree. 
CHORUS. 
When you have cash, never be rash, 
Don't cut a 
dash, or you'll go to smash; 
Then, just like me, you'll be all up a 
tree, 
If you and your money's once parted.

YES, dear Georgie, I 
shall leave you 
Ere the robin's cheerful song 
Tells the waking all around us 
That it is the early morn ;

Often have I 
wept for you, 
For you are so loving to me, 
And your heart is always true.

Georgie, raise me from the pillow, 
Love me, dear, while I 
remain, 
Brush the hair back from my forehead, 
Kiss my pallid cheek again. 
Georgie, liAen to the muic 
Of the crickets in the lawn, 
They and I 
will be quite silent 
Ere the coming day doth dawn; 
Then, dear Georgie, close my eyelids, 
Place my hands upon my breast, 
Tell the little birdies, Georgie, 
That your love has gone to rest. 
Georgie, raise me, etc. 
Then, dear Georgie, when they lay me 
In the chilly ground to sleep, 
You will wander to my graveside, 
But, dear Georzie, do not weep; 
Don't forget the ring I 
gave you, 
Always wear it. love, for me; 
Think cf all our happy meetings, 
When like doves we did agree. 
Cp.sor ,-Tie, raise me, etc.

"NORAII IS DREAMING OF YOU" 
SWEETLY the stars up above us are dreaming, 
The birds they are dreaming of morn; 
Sad is the moon, tho' in radiance beaming, 
She's dreaming alone and forlorn; 
Roses a-Al lilies so gentle and loving, 
Are dreaming, I 
know, in the dew, 
tio when afar you are thoughtlessly roving, 
Your .Norah is dreaming of you! 
CHORES. 
Still I 
am waiting, so sadly and lonely, 
0, tell me if still you are true! 
Dream of me, darling., for one moment only, 
While Norah, your Norah is dreaming of you! 
Tho' you forget me when far you are roaming, 
I 
shall not believe it, my own! 
Don't you remember you said in the gloaming, 
That I 
vas your darling alone! 
come to my heart like a 
bird that is weary, 
Oh, come to your Norah so true! 
Linger not long, for the days they are weary, 
While Norah is dreaming of you! 
Still I 
am waiting, etc. 
DO IF YOU DARE ! 
sung by Miss Krrrin BROORE. 
Written by Cruntss MERIOT.f. 
I'M one of those who don't object 
At all to hearty fun, 
And never, never mind a 
romp 
Or joke with any one; 
I 
do not often take offence 
At trifles light as air; 
But if young men are forward, why 
I 
say—Do if you dare! 
CHORUS. 
Do if you dare, sir! do if you dare ! 
Mind or you'll find that you'd better take care! 
Do if you dare, sir! do if you dare ! 
I'm but a 
female, but do if you dare! 
The way that gentlemen behave 
To us is really wrong ; 
They try to quiz our ankles 
As we gayly trip along, 
And then they'll cry, " I'll have your eye," 
Or, " 
have your back hair." 
My answer to such impudence 
Is but—D3 if you dare ! 
Do if you dare, sir! 
I've heard of rich old bachelors, 
Who wished a 
wife to get, 
But though I'm single I 
have never 
Met with one as yet; 
If such a 
one should say to-night, 
" 
My gold and jewels share, 
I'll marry you my dear," xyhy, 
Should say, Do if you dare ! 
DJ 
if you dare, sir 
etc. 
But I 
shall tire you if I 
stay, 
So think it only right, 
That for your kindness I 
should wish 
You one and all good night ; 
I'm not ambitious, and for work 
I 
never much did care, 
So do not pray cry out encore; 
Now then do if you dare! 
Do if you dare, sir! etc.

THE ANGELS ARE CALLING ME, MOTHER.

MITCHELL 
Music by W. A. HUNTLEY. 
The Music of this song is published by G. D. 
RUSSELL & CO., 126 Tremont 
St., Boston, Mass. Price 40 cents. 
THE angels are calling me, mother, 
I 
hear their sweet voices on high, 
They call me to join little Bertha 
Who dwells far above the blue sky ; 
I 
know they will treat rue with kindness, 
For look, they are smiling at me, 
Their arms are around one another, 
Come, mother, be quick and you'll see. 
CHORUS. 
Hark, mother, dear mother, they call me, 
Come nearer and look to the sky, 
They call me to join little Bertha, 
So, mother, your darling must die. 
The angels are calling me, mother, 
Just look at the heavens above, 
The gates they are open, and Bertha 
Is joining in praises of love; 
Oh see, she is beckoning to me 
To come and abide with her there, 
Oh, mother, she's smiling so sweetly, 
And looking so charming and fair. 
Hark, mother, etc. 
The angels are calling me, mother, 
Oh, listen and hear what they say, 
They tell me to haste to that Eden 
And not for a 
moment delay; 
So, mother, good bye, kiss your darling, 
For Bertha so charmingly sings 
That I 
must away then to join her, 
An angel with bright golden wings. 
Hark, mother, etc.

CLARENCE McGOWAN'S TROUBLES. 
AIR.—" Sold Everywhere." 
Sung by IIARRY K ERNELE. 
lInun I 
am, an Irishman, 
From -Ireland I 
came; 
I 
landed in America, 
And here I 
will remain. 
I 
had to struggle hard at first, 
And I 
don't think it was fair— 
No matter what I 
tried to do, 
I 
was sold everywhere. 
SPOKEN.—No 
matter what I 
tried to do, I 
couldn't get along. 
I 
once opened a 
cheap music store; a 
fellow came in one day 
and asked far a 
ballad called " Act on the Square, Boys ;" and 
I 
turned my back to him to get it, when he stole a 
four dollar 
fiddle, and ran out. 
I 
took my girl to a 
party once, and at the 
supper table I 
asked her if she liked cod- fish balls ? 
She said 
she didn't, nor she never attended one. But it's the same story, 
I 
was— 
CHORUS . 
Sold, sold, everywhere, 
Alas! I 
have been sold ; 
Sold here, sold there, 
The half has not been told. 
Sold right, sold left— 
It ain't no use to try. 
No matter what I 
try to do, 
I 
am sold everywhere. 
I 
went out once to a 
menagerie, 
• 
To see the animals jump ; 
When a 
monkey came bouncing out of a 
cage 
And gave me an awful thump. 
I 
immediately grabbed him by the tail, 
His tail it then came loose; 
And a 
little boy was standing by, 
Said, " Glue it on, you goose !" 
SPOKEN.—I 
Couldn't glue it on, and I 
was arrested for cruelty 
to orphans. 
I 
worked for a 
man once—the meanest man I 
ever 
saw. 
He was so mean, he used to talk through his nose, afraid 
of wearing his mouth out. 
He was so mean, he got married on 
tick; and he has been living on tick ever since. 
He got on a 
steamboat once, and when the captain came around to collect 
the fare, he jumped overboard. He walked ashore in fifteen feet 
of water. 
He was such a 
sponger he drew the water all up, and 
walked clean ashore. 
Once he hired two Chinamen to blast

rocks. 
They put in too much powder, and the rocks blasted 
them fifteen feet up in the air. 
When they came down, he took 
it out of their wages for the time that they were up. 
Sold, sold, etc. 
Wherever I 
go, I 
am bound 
To pluck misfortune's bitter fruits ; 
And find myself sold everywhere, 
Except about the boots. 
Come, Fortune, turn your wheel again, 
• And be a 
little fair; 
And give a 
good turn for one 
Who's been sold everywhere. 
Sold, sold, etc.

Bad luck to Casey's whiskey, it made us both so frisky,

WEBSTER'S BUSINESS MAN 
treats upon every topic incidental 
to the experience of a 
business man. 
While its main design is to instruct th.e 
reader in the details of commercial correspondence, the subject matter of these 
specimen letters embrace all points of interest to the general trader. 
Prominence has been given to banking, and the relationship between bank-
ers and their dealers, inasmuch as hundreds of thousands of persons main-
taining accounts of deposit and discount, are in ignorance of the duties of 
bankers and of the the rights and privileges of the dealer. 
To the body of the work has been appended:-
1. A Glossary of the Technicalities of Commerce, or terms employed by mer-
cantile men at home and abroad, as a 
peculiar and distinctive language not 
familiar to the preneral reader. 
2. A table of moneys in which mercantile accounts are kept in various 
foreign countries, information all important to dealers in imported merchan-
dize; and 
3. Several forms of important documents not to be found in a 
majority of 
works upon book-keeping. 
This work has been submitted to the perusal of several of our most eminent 
bankers and traders, and has invariably met with their approval.
