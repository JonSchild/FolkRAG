LG: 
Okay, this is Lisa Gabbert, and today I am talking to Dr. Brian Mackey, at his home here, 
in Salt Lake City. And today is November 8th, 2019; and this is part of the Physician Oral 
History project for the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress. 
 
 
Brian, thank you for talking to me today.

BM: 
Thank you. 
 
LG: 
You know you’re being recorded? 
 
BM: 
Yes. 
 
LG: 
Okay. And can you please tell me your birth year? 
 
BM: 
1974.  
 
LG: 
1974, okay; thanks.  
 
 
Well first of all, Dr. Mackey is an orthopedic hand surgeon. So, can you talk a little bit 
about where you went to medical school, what years, and sort of the progression of your 
medical training? 
 
BM: 
Okay. So, I guess starting before medical school, I had decided (after college) to go into 
medicine. So, I did a two-year master’s program, where I did research in Alzheimer’s in a 
basic sciences lab. And even at that time thought about going into research medicine.  
 
 
But then after that, went to medical school at Tulane, where I started in 2000, and then 
graduated in 2004.  
 
 
And you know, during the research years I really decided research wasn’t for me. So –  
 
LG: 
What was the Master’s degree in? 
 
BM: 
It was a science masters for research. 
 
LG: 
Okay. 
 
BM: 
I mean, just the basic sciences masters.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
BM: 
But I did research in Alzheimer’s and basic sciences type of research. It’s been a really 
long time, but we were doing a lot of PCR and studying different types of amyloid 
deposition patterns, and mice with different types of lipo-proteins.  
 
LG: 
And where did you do a fellowship? Or excuse me, a residency? 
 
[02:06] 
 
BM: 
So, then I did a residency at Washington University in St. Louis, which was a five-year 
program in orthopedic surgery. The first year was kind of split between orthopedics and 
general surgery –  
Physician Oral History: Brian Mackey 
Page 3 
 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
BM: 
So, I rotated through vascular surgery, pediatric surgery, and then basic kind of general 
surgery trauma service, as well as some time in the surgical intensive care unit.  
 
 
And then you know, the bulk of your orthopedic training is kind of the last four years. So, 
you get a little bit of early exposure that first year, but you’re kind of a you know, in an 
intern role for the different surgical specialties.  
 
 
But yeah, the four years at Wash U, and then I did a year at the University of Utah, for a 
hand fellowship (which is just an area of sub-specialty you can do after orthopedics). You 
can do sports, you can do spine, you can do trauma, you can do pediatrics, foot and ankle, 
shoulder and elbow – so, there’s a lot of different sub-specialties that you can go into.  
 
 
The majority of people from my training program end up doing fellowships, because I 
think just nowadays, it’s more important to be sub-specialized. As our treatments get (I 
think) more sophisticated, or evolve more quickly, I think it’s just easier to focus on one 
area. 
 
LG: 
Okay. 
 
BM: 
And then after the five years, I did a hand fellowship at the University of Utah, which 
was, you know, a year (basically) dedicated to kind of upper extremity: hand, elbow, 
wrist, trauma and micro-vascular trauma, replants, things like that. 
 
 
And then during that year, we decided to stay in the Salt Lake Valley, so I joined a group 
and I’ve been (more or less) with the same group since we’ve been here. 
 
[04:08] 
 
LG: 
What’s the name of the group? 
 
BM: 
It was Core, it’s now Peak Orthopedic. 
 
LG: 
Okay. Well let’s go back to the medical school training – well actually, let’s back up a 
little bit even more: how did you decide to become a doctor? 
 
BM: 
Oh, so my dad was a doctor growing up, so I was kind of familiar with it. I decided in 
college that I didn’t want to do medicine, and then kind of did a 180. I was thinking about 
different career options and the more I thought about it, I thought medicine was a good 
fit.  
 
 
But you know, when you’re young and kind of naïve, you just have to make a decision 
and go for it. 
 
Physician Oral History: Brian Mackey 
Page 4 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm, um-hmm. 
 
BM: 
So, for me it was just a process of making that decision and going through the different 
steps. 
 
LG: 
And for people who don’t know, what’s medical school like? Or what was it like when 
you attended? 
 
BM: 
Medical school is great. I kind of considered it glorified college. You know, it’s basically 
two years of classroom-type work, and then two years of more clinical-based stuff, where 
you’re working as a medical student on different kind of specialties.  
 
 
So, you know, you’re working in medicine, and ER, and surgery. But the first two years 
are basically just all classroom-type work; a little bit of kind of clinical exposure, but 
mostly classroom. So, you know, just a lot of studying and testing. I was in school in 
New Orleans, which was a really fun place; so, there was plenty of fun to be had.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
BM: 
But New Orleans was really wonderful place to be; a very unique place to live and yeah. I 
would do it again. 
 
LG: 
And what was the hardest thing about medical school for you? 
 
[06:06] 
 
BM: 
You know, really for me, like being in medical school – those four years you’re, you 
know, basically a glorified college student, so you’re not really starting a career, and 
you’re not really making any money (or you’re spending money).  
 
 
You know, meanwhile, your friends are kind of starting their careers, and buying homes, 
and kind of starting their life. So, it was just kind of that first part, where your life is just 
kind of on hold. I mean, that was probably the hardest thing. I mean, I thought that the 
class work, you know, was challenging; but it wasn’t bad. I mean, it wasn’t an unhappy 
way to live.  
 
 
But for me, just kind of seeing all my friends like getting jobs and kind of starting their 
life while I was still kind of in limbo –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. Can you talk a little bit about gross anatomy? That’s the class that’s most 
famous –  
 
BM: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
For people who don’t go to medical school. 
 
Physician Oral History: Brian Mackey 
Page 5 
 
BM: 
[Laughs] I mean, gross anatomy is definitely kind of a bizarre situation. But you know, 
after the first couple weeks you kind of get used to it. You know, I think the Tulane 
proctors were very much stressed the importance of respecting the bodies and respecting 
that these were people who gave their bodies to science. So, I never felt like there was 
any disrespect towards the bodies.  
 
 
But it is kind of a morbid scenario, so I found that when people are in morbid situations, 
sometimes humor does leak into the equation a little bit.  
 
 
But I remember the first test I took was really eye-opening, because I just couldn’t 
imagine that they would ask so many specific questions about small anatomy details. So, 
after the first anatomy test was an eye-opener, and I had to up my game a little bit.  
 
[08:15] 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] Nice. 
 
BM: 
But there was a funny story, and I don’t know if this ever happened for sure, but they 
would assign a bone box to each student (which was a human skeleton in like a wooden 
box) that you could take the bones out and study the different kind of anatomical features 
of the bones. And somebody (apparently) took their bone box home and left it on the 
trolley –  
 
LG: 
Oh, no. 
 
BM: 
And had forgotten it there, and that caused a bit of a raucous with the police.  
 
LG: 
I’m sure.  
 
BM: 
So, after that the bone boxes had to stay in the facility. 
 
[Laughter] 
 
LG: 
And you never know, that could be an apocryphal story, too. 
 
BM: 
Right [laughs]. 
 
LG: 
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
 
 
How did you decide to become an orthopedist? How did you decide on your specialty? 
 
BM: 
You know, when I was kind of rotating through the different surgical and non-surgical 
fields, I really loved medicine, and I had a mentor at Tulane that was an internal medicine 
doctor and he was head of the educational program. And the guy was just a fabulous 
educator, and a fabulous person.  
 
Physician Oral History: Brian Mackey 
Page 6 
 
 
And I kind of thought I wanted to do medicine; but when I started thinking about what I 
was going to be doing when I was 50, you know, I kind of had to readjust how I was 
thinking about it, because that’s ultimately –  
 
 
When you’re kind of 50 years old, that’s when you’re, you know, at the peak of your 
career, I think. Because after that it’s going to kind of, you know, your – I don’t know 
how to say it – your mind is still good, but your body and hand-eye coordination maybe 
go downhill a little bit. But your experience and everything has kind of converged at a 
point where you’re like – you’re at the peak if your career.  
 
[10:10] 
 
 
So, I was kind of thinking like, “Where do I want to be when I’m 50?” And I thought it 
was important to have a specific skill, you know, that couldn’t be outsourced or couldn’t 
be replaced by, you know, either physician extenders or computers and you know? 
 
 
I therefore, kind of figured I’d wanted to do a surgical specialty of some kind. And 
basically, the people I liked the most were the orthopedics. So, it just seemed like a fit, 
personality-wise, as far as seeing what the other people in the field were like.  
 
LG: 
Why did you like them? 
 
BM: 
I don’t know. It was kind of a can-do type of attitude. I think that they just seem very 
capable and confident. And you know, a lot of really intelligent people, and a lot of kind 
of fun, funny people, you know? So, I mean I think that you spend so much time with 
these people, that you know, you want to spend time with people that you like.  
 
 
So, yeah – I mean, I don’t really know exactly why. I wasn’t like one of these kids that 
always wanted to be an orthopedic surgeon. But once that opportunity kind of came up, it 
was really the only thing I wanted to do. You know, I thought about ENT, and Urology, 
and general surgery – and those just didn’t seem like a good fit for me. 
 
 
I never really thought too much about it [laughs]. 
 
LG: 
Can you talk a little bit about what that orthopedic residency was like? 
 
[12:08] 
 
BM: 
Yeah. Orthopedic residency was really hard. It’s a lot of kind of really long hours, a lot of 
kind of physical and mental challenges.  
 
 
I remember the first weekend of call I took, they call them “super Saturdays,” where 
you’re like an intern, covering the pager for kind of the Children’s Hospital and Barnes 
Hospital, which is – I mean, it’s – the hospital is huge, it’s (I don’t know) a mile or two 
across.  
 
Physician Oral History: Brian Mackey 
Page 7 
 
 
So, you would be handed the pager at seven o’clock in the morning, and then you’d be 
covering all the consult calls, all the floor calls, as well as some of the patient calls in (for 
their attendings). 
 
LG: 
Wow. 
 
BM: 
So, I mean your pager would just be going off all day. 
 
LG: 
Wow. 
 
BM: 
So, you’d be seeing consults in the ER; seeing floor consults, dealing with floor patients, 
dealing with phone calls from, you know, patients that had had surgery, from pharmacies 
– it was just like – it was really like drinking from a firehose. And it would be like 30 
hours of non-stop –  
 
LG: 
Wow. 
 
BM: 
Just non-stop action.  
 
 
I remember at the end of your Super Saturday, you’d just be soaked in sweat and 
exhausted –  
 
[Chuckling] 
 
 
And then but you know, I think it was good to be able to learn how to manage and 
prioritize, you know, different things. So, you know, you’d just have to learn what was 
urgent and what you could put on a back burner, and what, you know, what had to be 
addressed right away.  
 
 
But it’s also the personality of the resident above you and above them. Because there was 
always a third-year resident that was there for those days, as well as a chief resident that 
was taking call from home. And then you know, you would have an attending above that.  
 
 
So, you’d also have to learn the personalities of the residents above you, and the 
attendings, to know kind of what their expectations were.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
BM: 
So, it was balancing a lot of different things and I never really felt like I was actively 
learning it, but you just kind of absorb it, and just try and keep your head above water. 
 
[14:33] 
 
LG: 
Can you talk a little bit about when you say “long hours” – you mentioned the Super 
Saturdays, was that only – was that once a week? 
 
Physician Oral History: Brian Mackey 
Page 8 
 
BM: 
You would do one Super Saturday a month. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? And what about call? 
 
BM: 
Call kind of varied. They had transitioned to a new program that was pretty helpful for 
the second-years where they had a night float – so, a part of your rotation would be you 
come in at (I don’t remember if it was six pm or whatever) and you’re there until eight 
am. And then, you know, you’re there to get sign-out and check on patients that need 
checking out on.  
 
 
So, when you were a first-year, you really only took the Super Saturdays. And then when 
you transitioned to second-year, you would take call of the Children’s ER, which was a 
lot of form reductions and things like that. And that would be, you know, every third or 
fourth day, maybe? 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm; that’s quite a bit. 
 
BM: 
But the night float program really changed the whole dynamics of kind of Q3 call for the 
residents. So, it helped kind of take the burden off of, you know, doing that when you 
were rotating through your different programs. But then you would mostly just take call 
at the Children’s Hospital, so –  
 
 
And I’m not even sure if I remember exactly what the first-year call, otherwise. Oh, first-
year you would take call at the VA. You would have the VA pager. So, that was usually 
not a very busy ER, but kind of more bizarre things would show up in the VA than 
elsewhere [laughs]. 
 
[16:41] 
 
LG: 
Can you give an example? 
 
BM: 
Let’s see, I’m trying to think. There was a gentleman with an x fix, which is the pin and 
bar construct you use to put on (usually) leg injuries that you need to stabilize the bone. 
And he came into the ER with a horrible infection of those pins, you know, where they 
go into the skin? And they were asking him why, you know, what he was doing for his 
pin-site care – usually you do like a water or peroxide kind of cleansing of the area. And 
he said he was letting his cat do the pin-site care. 
 
LG: 
Oh, no. 
 
BM: 
So, the cat was licking the kind of pin, where it went into the skin [laughs]. 
 
LG: 
Oh, gee – poor guy. 
 
BM: 
So, [laughs] but you know; it was always, you know, (or usually) pretty quiet at the VA.  
 
Physician Oral History: Brian Mackey 
Page 9 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. Were there any particularly bizarre or interesting cases that you remember, 
from your time in residency? 
 
BM: 
I mean, there were you know, a lot of horrific injuries that, you know, that I won’t ever 
forget. But you know, I mean – we had a trauma guy that said that trauma is often not 
random [laughs]. So, when people get badly injured, a lot of times they’re maybe not in 
the best place at the best time. 
 
LG: 
I see. 
 
BM: 
But you know, I saw a lot of really horrible – just a lot of really horrible things. Which is, 
you know, the whole process of residency: you do kind of – you feel maybe a little bit 
dehumanized, because you’re just – maybe it’s one way of dealing with seeing people 
suffer, is that you dehumanize them, and then you know, you feel a little dehumanized 
yourself, because you’re kind of low on the totem pole.  
 
 
And you know, you kind of feel like your life is just kind of passing by, and you’re, you 
know just working so much. But all that passes, I think, with time as you get later on in 
residency, and especially out of residency and private practice. You know, for me – it 
definitely kind of came back, but it takes some time. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
[19:15] 
 
BM: 
You know, in the mornings you would look at x-rays. And it would be one thing to look 
at these horrible x-rays, horrible, you know, horrific injuries; and then you know, kind of 
talking (objectively) about them. But then you see the patient, and them in the follow-up, 
and you know, the agony that can come with that. But, yeah. 
 
LG: 
Do you feel like seeing those injuries, particularly early on, affected you in any, or you 
and your cohorts? Like how did people deal with that? 
 
BM: 
I think so. I mean, people just get a little jaded. And when you’re in residency –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
BM: 
You know, it’s – and I don’t know, you know – I mean, people always felt like they were 
being given so much work that if you felt like you could deflect work, you would. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
BM: 
You know? So, a lot of times the medicine people would ask for a consult. And you 
know, maybe you wouldn’t be as courteous as you should be. And you know, that 
changes drastically when you’re in private practice, and later in the years; because you 
realize that everybody in medicine is a team, and it’s, you know. You know, you just do 
Physician Oral History: Brian Mackey 
Page 10 
 
your part and they’ll do their part, and you know. But hopefully the end goal is a good 
outcome for, you know, a patient.  
 
 
But yeah, I mean – definitely, I mean, residency (in particular), I think the surgical fields, 
you get very jaded. 
 
LG: 
It sounds hard. 
 
BM: 
Yeah; I think it was – I mean, by far the hardest thing that I ever did.  
 
LG: 
Even more than your work now? 
 
BM: 
I’d say it’s different, you know? It’s like when I first started in kind of my own practice, 
there was nobody to bail you out, and you can’t leave until the work is done. So, you 
can’t sign out a surgery, or you can’t sign out a patient you have to see in the hospital.  
 
 
And if you’re on-call, you know – some of these calls you get in the middle of the night 
mean that you have to get up, out of bed, be up all night, and still do your regular job the 
next day.  
 
[21:33] 
 
 
So, that’s like the really tough thing, is that kind of as a doctor, everybody expects you to 
be at like 100% all the time; and it’s like, well if you’re also expected to be woken up at, 
you know – say you get out of bed at midnight, and you’re operating at two or three 
o’clock in the morning – it’s like you’re probably not going to be 100%. And then if you 
don’t get any sleep, like you’re not going to be 100% the next day.  
 
 
But the expectation is, is that you know, you be 100%, or you be infallible. And that’s 
just the thing that I don’t think people can really understand until you’ve been in that 
position. Especially, I mean, I enjoy my sleep, so –  
 
[Chuckling] 
 
LG: 
Does that expectation come from the physicians themselves? From the public? A 
combination? 
 
BM: 
I mean, I think that you know, you should give 100% of what you have to any patient, 
you know, irregardless of anything; but I think there’s a public expectation for physicians 
to, you know, be 100%. So, I think it’s probably both; I think so.  
 
 
I mean, you know, I would never not give somebody my all, you know? But it can be 
hard –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
Physician Oral History: Brian Mackey 
Page 11 
 
BM: 
So, I don’t know. 
 
LG: 
Can you talk a little bit about your work now – working on hands? Like what the actually 
entails, and what that means? 
 
BM: 
So, yeah – so, I do like my basic practice is kind of general kind of bread and butter 
fracture care, throughout the body. So, I’ll fix, you know, hip fractures or femur fractures, 
tibia fractures, ankle fractures, humerus and shoulder fractures, a lot of clavicle fractures.  
 
 
I’d say the majority of my elective practice is probably elbow down. So, I do a lot of 
nerve surgery; I do a lot of trauma-type surgery for elbow fractures, wrist fractures, 
(obviously) hand fractures. Surgery for kind of cut tendons and nerves. Part of it, (which I 
don’t really love) is replant call, which is where you’re, you know, replantation of 
amputated parts (mostly upper extremity). Those are, you know, tend to happen in the 
middle of the night, or at least get here. 
 
[24:10] 
 
LG: 
What does that mean – replant? 
 
BM: 
So, like amputations. So, if you’re putting a finger, or a hand –  
 
LG: 
Back on? 
 
BM: 
Back on. 
 
LG: 
I see. 
 
BM: 
Yeah. So, for me those take a long time; I’m just not the most efficient micro-vascular 
surgeon. But you know, those injuries (a lot of times) happen in outlying areas; and then 
they get shipped here. And then, you know, they are here at ten or 11 o’clock at night, 
and then you’re in the operating room. And that’s one of those kind of all-night scenarios. 
You know, and the – you know, they’re just tough, long surgeries. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
BM: 
Or at least they can be.  
 
 
But you know, I mean, I like kind of where I am now. I’m kind of at a point where, you 
know, I’m sometimes too busy, sometimes I’m not busy enough. But I think, you know, 
those kind of meet at a happy medium. So, I’ve learned just to enjoy it when it’s busy, 
and enjoy it when it’s a little slower.  
 
 
So, I mean there’s just always an unknown, what each week will hold.  
 
LG: 
What do you like best about your job right now? What aspects? 
Physician Oral History: Brian Mackey 
Page 12 
 
 
BM: 
I mean, I like being in the operating room much more than kind of in the clinic. But you 
know, I kind of like seeing patients back I have a good relationship with, and chatting 
with them, and you know, seeing how they’re doing, and seeing their outcomes.  
 
 
The operating room is kind of a, you know, can be a fun environment, you know, when 
things are going well.  
 
LG: 
Can you talk about that a little bit? 
 
BM: 
Yeah. I mean, you know, it’s kind of one of those things where, you know, the operating 
room can be kind of a fun place, where people chat and tell stories and jokes, and you 
know – and that’s really only if things are going well, or in between. Usually, during the 
surgeries (themselves) I’m kind of quiet and focused. But certainly, kind of before and 
after surgery it can be just kind of a fun place. 
 
[26:34] 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. Can you give any examples of any stories or things that people talk about? 
 
BM: 
You know, I mean sometimes, you know, the conversations are kind of making fun of 
each other. So, the PA that I work with and I will make fun of each other a fair amount. 
But you know, in kind of a humorous way. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. About what? Are there any particular things? 
 
BM: 
Let me think. There was a time period I was telling new people in the operating room that 
the PA I worked with had lost like 150 pounds –  
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
And that he needed a surgery to take excess skin away –  
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
That was kind of funny. 
 
LG: 
That’s cute. Did the surgeons ever make fun of each other? 
 
BM: 
Yeah, it think so. I mean, you know, a lot of my friends are also surgeons; and a lot of my 
friends are in medicine, you know, also. But you know, you’re not working with other 
surgeons too often. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
Physician Oral History: Brian Mackey 
Page 13 
 
BM: 
You know, you’ll be maybe in clinic with them, and they’ll be next to you. But you 
know, in the operating room it’s usually just the one surgeon. 
 
LG: 
I see. 
 
BM: 
But you know, and then you know, some days – if I have like a bunch of stressful cases, 
or you know, cases that are you know, specifically very stressful – I mean, those can be 
kind of tough moments, but they can be kind of fulfilling, you know? It’s kind of like 
trying to figure out a puzzle, you know?  
 
LG: 
Can you get more specific? 
 
BM: 
Yeah, I mean I think some, you know, some really bad elbow fractures can be really 
stressful, because there’s you know, you’re trying to piece together small, articular or 
joint pieces, and trying to get them stable in a way that the bone can heal. And you’re 
always got a concern of nerve and blood vessels around there. And so, those can be 
(definitely) very challenging kind of cases.  
 
[28:48] 
 
 
You know, a lot of times, like if I’m in like getting ready to go into a tough case, or even 
starting the night before – I’ll just run through the steps in my mind beforehand. And I 
think that that alleviates a lot of the stress that, you know, you feel about the unknown, is 
that you kind of go through each step in your mind. And you do it, you know, maybe 
even starting the day before. Or you know, (obviously) reading articles and textbooks 
about it can be helpful. But I think just running it over in your mind is really helpful. 
 
LG: 
So, you and I have talked about this – orthopedics is one of those specialties that is the 
target of a lot of humor. 
 
BM: 
[Laughs] Right.  
 
LG: 
Can you talk a little bit about that? 
 
BM: 
So, I mean, you know, at least I sense the kind of target of humor, even back at medical 
school. And in residency, it really kind of gets instilled in you that like if you’ve got a 
patient who has got a blood pressure issue, or a blood sugar or a diabetic issue, or any 
sort of medical issue it’s like, you know, we need medicine, you know?  
 
 
I mean, and I think it goes both ways. I think that if there’s a musculoskeletal issue, it’s 
like medicine is like, “Just call orthopedics.” Which you know, when you’re an intern 
with a pager can seem like a burden, but you know, you’re often on the other side of that.  
 
 
But you know, the general surgeons, and even you know, the urologists, and some of the 
other surgical specialists kind of take pride in their ability to manage the whole patient – 
especially the general surgeons, you know?  
Physician Oral History: Brian Mackey 
Page 14 
 
 
 
At least in training, and when we were on general surgery, it’s like they managed 
everything; the transplant surgeon, same thing: they manage everything.  
 
 
But for orthopedics, it’s like if this is, you know, a heart or a blood sugar problem, or an 
endocrine problem – it’s like, you know, have medicine take care of it. Like you know? 
It's just, you know, it may come across as being too lazy to try and figure it out for 
yourself, or go back and try and remember what you’ve learned. But really, it’s like, you 
just want what’s best for the patient.  
 
[31:22] 
 
 
But there have been some jokes about orthopedic surgeons. I’m trying to remember. 
There was one that basically goes through, you know, “Where do you hide a dollar bill 
from an internal medicine doctor?” 
 
 
 
“Under a dressing.” 
 
 
Or where do you hide a dollar bill from an orthopedic surgeon? In a book. 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
BM: 
I’m trying to remember. Oh, where do you hide a dollar bill from a radiologist? You 
can’t. 
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
And then there was one that was basically – let’s see, how did it go? What do you call 
two orthopedic surgeons reading an EKG? It’s a double-blind study. [Laughs] Boom, 
boom. 
 
LG: 
[Laughing] 
 
BM: 
Yeah. I mean, I think you know, really like in medicine you don’t learn – you know, in 
medical school musculoskeletal and orthopedics is kind of a very minor part of it. So, 
when you start residency, it’s like you have to go back a little bit, you know? You have to 
kind of – I think you’re starting off with a little bit less pre-existing knowledge than like 
in medicine, or anything like that.  
 
 
But yeah, I mean I think there has definitely been an evolution of orthopedic surgeons, 
you know, from years ago where, you know, it was not a very competitive specialty.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
BM: 
But as treatment and need for it has grown it has become much more kind of competitive 
to get into.  
Physician Oral History: Brian Mackey 
Page 15 
 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
BM: 
So, it used to have kind of the – you know, we used to be the easy thing to get into, so it 
was like, “Oh, orthopedic surgeons are, you know, the dumb ones,” or whatever.  
 
LG: 
What about female orthopedic surgeons? 
 
[33:23] 
 
BM: 
So, you know, the percentage of female orthopedic surgeons used to be like very, very 
low; it’s becoming much more common now –  
 
LG: 
Is it? 
 
BM: 
Yeah. I’m trying to think. So, in my residency – so, it was five years, six people, 30 – 
there were maybe five or six women? 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
BM: 
You know, at any given time; at least one in each class. But I think the year after I left 
they had like four girls and two guys. So there has been a transition, you know: more 
women going into orthopedics. I guess there were – there was a preconception that they 
weren’t strong enough for orthopedics – because it does sometimes –  
 
LG: 
That’s what I’ve heard. 
 
BM: 
Require, you know – sometimes it does require some, you know, some kind of brute 
force. But you know, I think that a lot of the girls that go into it are, you know, anywhere 
from kind of, you know, more delicate appearing to less-delicate appearing. But you 
know, I think that the percentages are probably 20% now. 
 
LG: 
So, better? 
 
BM: 
Better, yeah. 
 
LG: 
Or higher, anyway? 
 
BM: 
Yeah, definitely. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
BM: 
And actually in hand surgery there was a lot of women going to hand surgery. 
 
LG: 
Yeah, probably because it’s a little bit more –  
 
Physician Oral History: Brian Mackey 
Page 16 
 
BM: 
Yeah, it’s probably less –  
 
LG: 
[Inaudible] 
 
BM: 
Yeah, less hammering and kind of stuff like that.  
 
 
But you know, there is probably 30-50% like in training now (I’m guessing).  
 
LG: 
Okay, I have a question about a rumor –  
 
BM: 
Um-hmm? 
 
LG: 
And I want to know whether it’s true: is it true that the orthopedic tool cart is intimidating 
to patients, and so they put them out before surgery? 
 
[35:24] 
 
BM: 
No; I mean, the room has to be open and ready to go before the patient rolls in. So, they 
usually open all the instruments and have them out when the patient rolls in.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
BM: 
You know, some of the implants, and some of the things they’ll open up after surgery has 
kind of started. But yeah, I mean there is, you know, saws, and mallets, and hammers.  
 
 
You know, a lot of times patients will be given Versed before surgery, so they’re kind of 
in a, “I don’t care,” –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
BM: 
You know, state. But yeah, I mean usually everything is kind of open and ready to go. 
 
LG: 
Can you talk a little bit about (particularly from an orthopedic perspective) what it means 
to be responsible for a patient’s health? 
 
BM: 
Yeah. I mean, that’s the – you know, I think the first three to five years after getting into 
private practice, you definitely have to adjust to that. You know, you tie yourself in with 
people’s outcomes and you worry and you stress. And you know, it can have an impact at 
home: sleeping, and stuff like that.  
 
 
And I think that, you know, as time goes on you’re able to kind of disassociate yourself 
from that a little bit, just you know? But early on, that was probably, you know, one of 
my struggles, was wondering if I did the right thing for somebody, or if I could have done 
something different for a better outcome?  
 
Physician Oral History: Brian Mackey 
Page 17 
 
 
But you know, you have to realize that you have to keep yourself mentally and physically 
healthy, so that you can go forward. But that process takes three to five years, I’d say.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. It sounds very stressful. 
 
BM: 
Yeah, it is very stressful. I mean, when you’re doing your first case and there’s no fellow 
or attending above you to like help bail you out. Or even in, you know, some of these 
bigger, kind of academic settings – it’s like if an attending gets into a tough situation, it’s 
like there’s other attendings around that they can, you know, help. But like when you’re 
in, you know, which where I started was kind of a small community hospital, there was 
nobody. 
 
[37:50] 
 
 
But you know – I mean, I think good planning beforehand kind of helps prevent those 
scenarios. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? And how have you, personally, handled that stress (or not)? 
 
BM: 
I don’t know [laughs]. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
BM: 
I know I’ve just kind of tried to divide, you know, have a divide in my mind between, 
you know, worrying about somebody and letting it leak into, you know, everywhere else. 
That’s probably the best way in can describe it. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. Like a boundary? 
 
BM: 
Yeah; like a mental boundary, I guess. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm, um-hmm.  
 
 
Do you feel like you have ever – whether in the course during residency training, or in 
medical school, or afterwards – feel like you have suffered, because you’re taking care of 
patients, or because of your training, in any kind of way? 
 
BM: 
I mean, I don’t know like suffering; but like you definitely, you know, you go through a 
process where – I don’t know if you feel dehumanized, or what – but you know, early on 
in residency is really tough. It’s like your schedule is weird, you’re at the bottom of the 
totem pole, you’re working really long hours, but you’re not really doing all the surgery, 
you know, you’re kind of assisting.  
 
 
You know, but I think it’s all a part of the process, I think. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
Physician Oral History: Brian Mackey 
Page 18 
 
 
BM: 
I don’t know. I mean, I think it definitely, you know, I’m gone an awful lot, and I was 
gone, you know, an awful lot when my kids were young. So, I mean I think – yeah, I 
mean, you lose out on a lot of things. You work a lot of holidays, and weekends, and stuff 
like that; so, you –  
 
[40:02] 
 
 
You know, I think there is a cost to your family –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
BM: 
But you know, I mean, I think that you can also take days off, too, here and there; and 
that’s kind of what I’ve learned to try and do. But you know, again – that can not always 
work out, you know? Emergencies happen or whatever – schedules dictate otherwise. 
 
 
But you know, for me – I just learned that like, you know, I try and work hard, but I also 
try and play hard. So –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. Doctors are (generally, not orthopedic surgeons) – doctors generally are an 
occupation that is sort of stereotyped as having a good sense of humor –  
 
BM: 
Yeah, I’d agree with that. I mean –  
 
LG: 
Why do you think that might be? 
 
BM: 
I don’t know. I think there’s a lot of smart people in medicine and I think smart people 
can be funny. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
BM: 
I think that when you’re in a kind of morbid scenario, or you’ve seen kind of some of the 
things that you see in medicine – that humor kind of brings a levity to it, you know, to 
maybe – I don’t know, as a way of emotionally adjusting, I don’t know? 
 
 
But you also see a lot of really funny things in medicine. I mean, just some of the things 
that people do, and –  
 
LG: 
Can you give an example? 
 
BM: 
[Laughs] I mean, I can’t really – let me think on that. 
 
LG: 
Okay, okay. 
 
 
If you were going to give advice to somebody who was thinking about going into medical 
school, what kind of advice would you give them? Or what would you say to them? 
Physician Oral History: Brian Mackey 
Page 19 
 
 
[41:52] 
 
BM: 
You know, I’d say it’s like, you know, the whole process is at least kind of the 15-20-
year process, you know? So, I mean I think that, you know, you’ll never know until you 
do it. And by the time you finish it, it’s like that’s all that you can do; you’re over-trained 
and specialized –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
BM: 
So, it’s not like you could go and open a business, or go do law, or whatever. It’s like 
once you finish it, there’s you know, not many ways out. But you’ll never know until you 
do it [laughs]. 
 
 
But you know, I definitely do think it’s a decision to be made seriously. And in fact, one 
of my mentors in medical school told me that you’re making a decision for a 50-year-old 
(you know, this goes back to that 50-year-old thing) –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
BM: 
And he’s like, “I don’t know many 50-year-olds that would let a 24-year-old make this 
decision for them.” 
 
LG: 
Right. 
 
BM: 
So, I mean – it’s an unknown. And I don’t know, I mean, I think the future of medicine 
will always be good. I mean, it’s you know, if you want a good job, with a stable job 
outlook, you know, medicine is a no-brainer, you know 
 
 
In 2008-2009, when people were struggling to find work, it was just like doctors could 
find work anywhere.  
 
 
But you know, I really do hope that it continues to be financially appealing for people. 
You know, I don’t think, you know, I don’t think it would be worth it if you didn’t make 
a good living doing it. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
BM: 
But you know, at the same time, like if you want to be rich, like, don’t go into medicine 
[laughs], you know? You’re giving up a lot of years of financial earning, and you know, 
to do that. So, I don’t really know. 
 
 
People ask like would I want my kids to do medicine? And some days it’s yes, some days 
it’s no.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
Physician Oral History: Brian Mackey 
Page 20 
 
 
[44:17] 
 
BM: 
But it’s never really going to be up to me. So, I would never – you know, I would never 
try and convince them one way or the other. But like if they show an interest, I’m happy 
to talk to them about it. But my expectations are not for them to go into medicine. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
BM: 
You know? And medical training and everything will probably change. I mean, I know 
that, you know, the work hours in Europe are a lot more manageable, where it’s more like 
a real job. But the training duration is spread out longer; so, I mean, if they’re limiting 
them to 40 or 60 hours per week, then you know, you have to tack on more years. So, I 
don’t really know.  
 
 
I mean, you know, they had work restrictions that were 80 hours a week for us, but you 
know, you just wouldn’t (at least me) – I just wouldn’t report it, you know? If you report 
it, then it pulls somebody in, and they have to take care of it. It’s just, you know, it just 
added a disruption. So, I mean, to me it seemed better just to put your head down and do 
whatever you needed to do. 
 
LG: 
Get it done? 
 
BM: 
Get it done. But I don’t know, you know – I think maybe if we have universal healthcare, 
and kind of a government-run, you know, medical program, or government-run 
healthcare and hospitals and residency programs, you know – there would be pros and 
cons to that. But I’m not even sure what they would be [laughs], you know? 
 
LG: 
Complicated? 
 
BM: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Okay. Is there – we’ve gone through most of my questions. Is there anything else that you 
would want people to know about what it’s like to be an orthopedic surgeon? 
 
[46:17] 
 
BM: 
No. I mean, you know, I just think that, you know, I think that for the most part, you 
know, doctors really always want to do what’s best by the patient, you know? When 
we’re in all these different meetings, talking about, you know –  
 
 
We’re building a new clinic now, and like surgery center meetings, and all of this stuff – 
it’s like, really, even behind closed doors a lot of these discussions are about how to make 
patient care the best. And it really is about how to enhance the patient experience, and 
make it more convenient, safer, and a better kind of process for the patient.  
 
Physician Oral History: Brian Mackey 
Page 21 
 
 
So, I mean I think, you know, even behind closed doors, like patients are most important. 
So, I mean I don’t know if people want to hear that, but maybe that makes someone feel 
better [laughs]. I don’t know. 
 
LG: 
I think it’s important. 
 
BM: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
That people know. Okay. Alright, well thank you very much. 
 
BM: 
Alright, thank you. 
 
LG: 
I’m going to do a closing tag. 
 
 
Again, this is Lisa Gabbert, and I’m talking to Dr. Brian Mackey in his home in Salt Lake 
City. Today is November 8th, 2019. 
 
BM: 
Yeah.
