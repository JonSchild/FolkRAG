To my family And
 friends:
 
I trust y u will excuse the form letter,  but some news is better
 
than none and my  left hand disability precludes my writing many
 
individual letters  (they must all be computer dictated).
 
I have just returned from a splendid two-week trip to Mexico and
 
California.
 A few years ago I began recording music of the Ser i
 
Indians  in  Sonora  on the  coast  of mainland Mexico  some  6 hours
 
drive  south of Tucson.
 The Seri,  numbering only seven hundred,
 
having been slaughtered by the Mexican army at the end of the 19th
 
century,
 are  nonetheless  a  cheerful,
 friendly  people  with  a
 
fascinating history and culture.
 We converse in broken Spanish -
-
their language,  spoken fluently by all tribal members,  is simply
 
too difficult, so I concentrate my efforts on improving my Spanish.
 
Because of their isolation, their musical style is quite unique and
 
of  considerable  interest  to  me.
 Some  time  ago  I realized  I'd
 
become the areal specialist in Western Woodlands Native American
 
music and to some extent also that of the Great Basin,  due to my
 
work  in  Nevada  a  decade  ago.
 So  the  foray  into  music  of
 
northwestern Mexico represents widening my knowledge and is a new
 
adventure and challenge for me.
 
I flew to Albuquerque and was picked up the next morning by Jack
 
Loeffler,
 a  great  friend,
 author  of  the  as  yet  unpublished
 
biography of the ecologist-writer Edward Abbey and superb recording
 
engineer who had worked on several Folkways albums for our office.
 
Jack  drives  an  ancient  beat-up  truck  which  is  nevertheless
 
reliable.  He'd recorded as well for me in early January when I was
 
last in Mexico.
 We stopped for some wonderful red chili in Hatch,
 
New Mexico, the chili capital of the world, then drove on to Tucson
 
and the following day south to Nogales and Hermosillo, then west to
 
Bahia Kino,  a rather sleepy fishing town on the coast.  There our
 
mutual friend Gary Nabhan, a MacArthur grant recipient and science
 
director  for  the  Arizona-Sonoran  Desert  Museum  in  Tucson,  had
 
rented a nice beach cottage for the month of March.  It was located
 
about 30 km south of Punta Chueca, where the Seri live on what they
 
can gather from the desert and sea  (in anthropology parlance they
 
are  the  last  "Hunter-gatherings"  in  all  of  Mexico).
 Gary  was
 
joined  by  his  girlfriend,  a registered  nurse  who  is  conducting
 
diabetes research and providing medical assistance to the Indians.
 
After  our  usual  breakfast  each  morning  consisting  of  eggs  with
 
whatever  was
 leftover  -
-
 beans,
 tortillas,
 salsa,
 scrambled
 
together  --our daily  routine then required driving  the two-hour
 
trip through the desert on a nearly impossible kidney-shattering
 
unpaved road  (we had  3 flat tires  on one  trip alone)  in Jack's
 
truck, through cactus deserts and the el nino-washed desert in full
 
bloom.  With Jack's  state-of-the-art digital recording equipment,
 
we searched out singers and recorded nearly a hundred songs in one
 
week as well as many hours of interview material to contextualize
 
the  melodies.
 (Mostly  their  songs  are  accompanied  by  sistrum
 
rattles or rasps, although the Seri like their neighbors the Yacqui
 
have  the  single-string  fiddle,  which  I am  totally  convinced  is
 
aboriginal  and  not  borrowed  from  Spanish  tradition,  as  other
 
scholars have surmised.)
 It now remains for me to transcribe into
 
musical notation the several hundred songs I've collected, organize
 
the material for analysis and begin writing scholarly papers on the
 
subject for various ethnomusicology meetings.
 My colleagues who
 
are  also  specialists  in  Indian  music  have  all  expressed  great
 
enthusiasm for this new direction of mine,  as not much  is known
 
about Indian music in northwestern Mexico.
 
Bahia Kino is actually two villages -
-
 the older one is where most
 
Mexicans live and where one can enjoy good inexpensive food from
 
various tacquerias as well as being forced to use one's Spanish.
 
The newer section consists of about two miles of newly constructed
 
beach homes for wealthy Mexicans, who use them very infrequently.
 
There is also a ghastly recreational vehicle park for retirees from
 
California,
 who  spend  the  days  inside  their  air-conditioned
 
vehicles watching television from Los Angeles.  That would be fine,
 
except they have adopted the only decent restaurant in the area as
 
their own,  pouring in there every evening about 5 for margueritas
 
and dinner.
 They are loud and entertain themselves and visiting
 
friends  by doing touristy things--  for example,  the Mexican hat
 
dance.
 This would be fine except that the house band is a superb
 
local  string  orchestra  with  a wonderful  repertoire  of  Sonoran
 
corridos but it's impossible to hear these indigenous songs because
 
the  Americans  have  jammed  the  request  list  with  old  tourist
 
favorites like "Cielito Lindo" and other stereotypical Mexican pop
 
music.
 Still,  by eating  later one gets a bit more peace.
 They
 
have wonderful seafood  (the restaurant is called "El Pargo Rojo"
 
meaning red snapper). My favorite dish there is "p0110 mojo en ajo"
 
which  is  half  a  chicken  looking  like  it  was  flattened  by  a
 
bulldozer and injected with garlic!
 
While  we  were  busy  recording,  Gary was  making  arrangements  for
 
building a cinderblock structure in the Indian school grounds to
 
secure the nearly extinct San Esteban chuckwalia -
-
 an endangered
 
lizard slightly smaller than the iguana, which Gary has at home in
 
Tucson as  a pet!  His museum has been breedingthem  in captivity.
 
The Seri traditionally ate this reptile when they ran out of other
 
food.
 The problem of killing all the cats in the Indian village we
 
left in Gary's hands when we departed for Tucson.
 
I spent one night in Tucson where I took out to dinner the son of
 
my first student at Brooks School years ago.
 He's a senior at the
 
University of Arizona, a lacrosse player and musician.
 We went to
 
"L'il Abners" my favorite restaurant there about 30 miles north of
 
town.
 It serves only beef ribs,  each about  14  inches  long,  and
 
barbecued to such tenderness that the meat veritably falls off the
 
bones.
 One  is  seated  at  rustic  outside  wooden  tables  and
 
entertained by a wonderful old time string band playing mostly the
 
Texan repertoire of Bob Wills  from the  40s.
 The next two days I
 
was in Phoenix with my Indian musician friends,  then flew to Los
 
Angeles, where I stayed in Pacific Palisadess with Vicki Perkins,
 
married to a former student of mine whom she met at Harvard.
 They
 
lived in Brazil for ten years and there house is, like mine, a sort
 
of  ethnographic museum.
 John was  in Brazil raising money for a
 
film they wrote about Indians on the Amazon during the Brazilian
 
gold rush.
 While in Hollywood I had preliminary discussions with
 
a film agent  about possibly advising  on  a major  film which was
 
based mostly on information in my lacrosse book.
 That has yet to
 
play out, and I'm moving very cautiously on it.  We'll see.
 I also
 
visited the new Getty museum, which is clearly spectacular albeit
 
controversial.
 
After a day with my cousins in Santa Barbara, I flew to San Jose to
 
give my illustrated lecture on Indian lacrosse to the lacrosse team
 
of Santa Clara, then spent the night in Pebble Beach before flying
 
to San Diego  for a huge high school  lacrosse tournament  for the
 
weekend mostly signing books and giving the lecture.
 I flew back
 
to  Washington  from  there  and  now  after  about  two  weeks  have
 
recovered sufficiently from all the travel!
 
In other news,  my album American Warriors which was released by
 
Rykodisc last spring has been nominated in three categories for the
 
Native American Music Awards in late May.
 They seem to want me to
 
help  the  event,  possibly  even  sharing  the  MC  stand  with  Wayne
 
Newton and Ritchie Havens!  The $1000-a-plate event will be held at
 
the new billion dollar casino of the Pequot Indians in Connecticut.
 
It comes right in the middle of the final four lacrosse playoffs at
 
Rutgers,  and will be quite a balancing act getting back and forth
 
but feasible.
 Additionally,  I'm curating the Wisconsin program at
 
our Folklife Festival in late June and early July.
 The lacrosse
 
World Games are in Baltimore in mid-July, so I expect to get out to
 
Madeline Island by about the end of that month, which is later than
 
usual.
 
My health  is  reasonably  stable,  although my neurologic problems
 
continue to plague me and confuse the doctors.  On the bright side,
 
I'm to receive botox injections  in my  left arm next week at the
 
National Institutes of Health, trying to free up the stroke-induced
 
involuntary muscle flexion in the left hand.
 Hopefully this might
 
work enough to allow me to type and possibly even play the piano
 
again.
 Time will tell.
 I hope this finds you well and happy.

Dear Bess,
 
O HI O  U NI V E RSI T Y
 
I
've been teaching in the film school at Ohio University for the last
 
few years and have lost touch with many in my old community.
 
I am researching a piece that I
' m writing on Dock Boggs for the
 
Appalachian Journal, Appalachian State Univ., Boone, NC.
 
Recently,  I purchased a tape that had Alan's work on it.  Its the only
 
known existant footage of Dock Boggs,  shot at Newport in 1966.  I
' ve
 
spoken to Mike Seeger about it and he gave me your address.
 
What I
' m after is information on who shot the film footage, where,  and
 
where is it archived now.
 
So,  I was wondering if you could give me an address or phone number so
 
that I might be able to learn more about this footage.
 
I
've called Vestapol Video,  Stephen Grossman, but always get an
 
answering machine and they never call me back. They released the footage
 
on a video,  Shady Grove: Old T
ime Music f
rom North Carolina, Kentucky, and
  
Virginia.
 
I hope that your new (not so new now)  life has been rewarding and
 
comforting.  I can't imagine the NEA without you.  I really appreciated
 
your support of Appalashop and June Appal and will never forget your
 
visit back in the  '
70s.
 
Sincerely,
