Phil was born in 1947 in Ventura, California.  He grew up in Ojai California until the age of  8 
when his mom married and they moved to Homer Alaska in 1956 and a homestead on Cohen 
Island on the southside of Kahemak Bay.  Phil began fishing beach seining by himself out of a 
small skiff.  He eventually acquired an old Bristol Bay double ender he converted to a 
seiner/longliner named the Crystal Dawn Phil worked up to a small seiner called the Joyride and 
then the Anna Marie.  He fished throughout Kachemak Bay and the outer coast in the Gulf of 
Alaska. He has an in-depth knowledge and experiences in the fisheries and environmental 
change in Kachemak Bay.  His sister Ann Daigle was also interviewed, and Phil has a strong 
relationship to the community on the southside of Kachemak Bay described in interviews with 
Dick Dunn, Dave Seaman, Renee Pupura and Ann Dailge. He lives in Homer, Alaska. 
 
 
00:00-05:00 
Came to Homer in age 8 1956. Big adventure. Mom divorcee married brother of 
neighbors, Chuck Abbot, who lived in Homer.  Flew to Anchorage drove to 
Homer.  Road from Anchorage to Homer gravel, developed in 1952.  All day drive 
to go from Homer to Anchorage.  Loved outdoors took to life, hunting and 
fishing, no worries about rattle snakes and poison oak in Alaska. 
 
05:00-10:00 
Stepdad brilliant at land acquisition, worked as cartographer. Civil war script 
issued by union to soldiers in-leu of pay use to purchase federal land.  Acquired 
land on Cohen Island used script to acquire the Homer Spit, partner Earl 
Hillstrand, acquire end of the Spit.  Starts Standard Oil. Business conducted in 
bars, starts Salty Dawg Saloon next to Standard Oil  
 
10:00-15:00 
Federal Government encourage people to settle in Alaska, provide land 
acquisition rights. Mother arrives with land rights; Step dad helps acquire 
valuable properties across southside of Kachemak Bay.  Land in Little Tutka 
where sisters live (See Ann Daigle interview).  Learned to be seafaring.  No 
harbor in Homer, use WWII amphibious vehicle to drive deown spit and motor 
across the Bay.  5 knots, low freeboard used year-round.  Early fisheries, Seldovia 
fishing fleet developing crab fishery in Kachemak Bay, summer salmon fishing 
out coast, Port Dick, Port Chatham, Nuka passage.  Also, big Port Graham salmon 
fleet. 
 
15:00-20:00 
Return from college 1970 as hippy. Homer anti-hippy.  Bought a skiff to live on 
Cohen Island cobbled together cheap outboards.  Needed source of income.  If 
became fisherman could justify living on Cohen Island and get better boat. Start 
beach seining, gets net form cousins.  Fishing out of skiff Dolly varden $.48 cents 
per pound. Tie net off on beach make set pull in by hand, use sea anchor to hold 
net in the water, pull net in over wooden roller

20:00-25:00 
Challnges of setting net out of outboard skiff “nip and tuck” Learned from Gus 
Stevens, old timer, Sadie Cove, former salmon troller of Washington coast. First 
person who knew how to catch King salmon year-round in Kachemak Bay. Other 
people had “real boats” Seldovia and English Bay seine fleets.  Small Homer fleet 
“Potato Boats” Fished Humpy Creek, China Poot and Tutka Bay.  China Poot 
productive ecology, 15, 20,000 fish return.  Port Graham Flatties, small boats 
eventually replaced by bigger boats. 
 
25:00-30:00 
Homer seiners 36–42-foot plywood flat bottom boats, plywood new technology.  
Hydraulics and seine block transformational technology change.  Hand purse, 
pull in leads by hand instead of power pursing.  Kachemak Bay seiners round 
hauling in shallow water versus holding hooks.  Jitneys, shallow work boats 
developed for Humpy Creek open boat, carrying full size net, fish shallow water 
well in front  to fish close to beach.  Started without hydraulics.  Have become 
highly advanced able to fish in 10” of water.  Had combination Boat Joyride 
small, shallow draft but good sea boat. 
 
30:00-35:00  Jitney fishing begins at Humpy Creek, Kamishak Bay Jitney fishing, shallow with 
hard bottom.  Building Crystal Dawn convert 29ft. Bristol Bay double into seiner.  
Bought to drift fish in Upper Cook Inlet, didn’t qualify for limited entry permit.  
Qualified for Lower Cook Inlet permit. Steep learning curve was a “screamer” 
fished from Tutka, China Poot to Bear Cove, good price for pink salmon in early 
years. 
 
35:00-4:000 
Could make money round-hauling  small schools, multiple processors on Homer 
spit, day fishery.  Fished outer coast during second year, bad luck couldn’t catch 
fish. Lots of red salmon in Nuka Bay.   
 
40:00-45:00 
Finally luck changed loaded boat with 9,000 lbs no tender, boat sinking, bailing 
with five gallon buckets sea lions chase boat.  6 inches of free board, circle 
Chiswell Island, sinking off Bear Glacier.  Deliver in Seward, mutiny on tender 
police arrive. 
 
45:00-50:00 
Fishing halibut on Crystal Dawn 1976-1978.  Two-week halibut openers.  Fished 
in Chinitna Bay, lots of dog fish, fished using J hooks. Halibut fleet growing, 
decline in shrimp and crab populations.  Late 1970s-early 1980s, halibut and 
other bottom fish numbers increase.  Crab population slowly improving halibut 
are beginning to decline. 
 
50:00-55:00 
Begin fishing new boat Joyride, 32 ft Bristol Bay drift boat modified in to small 
seiner. Ability to make more sets but still fish shallow, small one strip seine and 
hand pursing.  Salmon fishing improved in 1980s.  Big fishing year in 1988 “Late 
Great 88”.  $3.00 a pound for reds, .80 cents a pound for pinks.  Lots of big sets

for chum salmon.  Made enough  from 1988-1989 to upgrade to bigger boat, and 
buy the Anna Maria.  1989 oil spill, fisherman receive pay out from Exxon based 
on pre-season revenue predictions and chartering for oil spill clean-up. Used 
jitney to fish to fish Kamishak and Chenik.  Reds run up to lake, productive 
system for 5-6 years. 
 
55:00-60:00 
Fortunes made and lost at Chenik.  Good chum fishing at Iniskin and Cape 
Douglas in 1988, fished late caught over 1000,000 pounds of Chum. 65  boats in 
fleet spread out across the fishing district.    Opposition to development of oil 
pipeline because of oil spill George Ferris oil rig spill in Kachemak Bay.  Creation 
of Kachemak Bay Defense Fund to protect the Bay from oil and gas development.  
Dedicate portion of catch in 1976 to funding Bay protection defense.  Governor 
Hammond wines governorship, based on buy.-back  of leases.  Bay designated 
critical habitat area protected from oil and gas development.  Need to 
permanently protect Lower Cook Inlet.  Halibut fishing with Joyride, use power 
block to haul gear, coil into tubs, use skate bottoms set off baiting table off the 
back of the boat.  Halibut derby fishing, always took place during bad weather.  
Lead up to IFQ, 90% of fleet opposed IFQ program.  Halibut fleet based in Seattle 
primary beneficiaries.  Limit on qualifying years to qualify for IFQ.  Salmon crash 
after 1988.  Halibut fishing was how many fisherman made boat payments.  
Caught 15,000 pounds during non-qualifying  years, wound up with 2,000 
pounds of quota. 
1:05-1:10 
 Sell IFQ  and after 1996 buy Kodiak seine permit.  1996 big seine year in 
Kachemak Bay, reds flood in.   Marona, sole tender for Cook Inlet Processing in 
Kachemak Bay.   Shouting match between Phil and Dave Seaman.  Catches over 
100,000 pounds from Kachemak Bay.  Predominantly westerly winds on big 
years.  2004 also big year in Kachemak Bay.  1978 legendary year, not 
predominate westerlies.    
 
1:10-1:15 
Past few years, hard winters.  Last summer, summer that never happened.  This 
year 40 degrees  in February and March, as a kid weather at zero degrees that 
time of year.  1972 walked from head of the Bay from Bear Cove off shore and 
into Fox River Valley to visit homesteader who raised cattle up there.   Bradley 
Lake Hydro-electric power  generation releases more fresh water that freezes  
piles up at base of the Spit.  Old timers say Bay use to freeze all the way to 
Halibut Cove.   Tutka Bay would freeze, careful to navigate through all the coves 
and bays in winter with a wooden boat.  Biggest fishery changes are transition 
from fisheries that supported subsistence lifestyle to big fisheries. 
 
1:15-1:17 
Shellfish beginning  to return after 30 years.  Never use to sea Sea Otters in 
Kachemak Bay.  Clams and cockles on the surface of the beaches.  Dungeness 
crab were everywhere.  Late 1970s see first sea otters.

Working on other boats, fished for John Hillstrand on the Invader. Mostly fished 
for himself, not sought after deckhand.   Skiffman on seiner in Togiak.  Fished in 
Togiak multiple times , huge fuel bill to make trip out there.  Japanese fish-
buyers provide herring gill nets with glass floats for herring fishery.  Most former 
deckhands that fished for him have passed.  Visit shed to see old fishing gear.
