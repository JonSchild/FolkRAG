JOHNNY, I 
HARDLY KNEW YE, IRISH COMIC 
SONGSTER. 
Johnny, I hardly -knew ye. 
As sung by Johnny Roach, the successful Irish comedian. 
When on the road to old Athy, ahoo, ahoo, 
The harvest moon was in the sky, ahoo, ahoo, 
I 
heard a 
dolorous damsel cry, 
Och 1 
Johnny, I 
hardly knew ye. 
CHORUS. 
Vid your drums and guns, and guns and drums, 
The enemy fairly slew ye; 
Isly darling dear, you look so queer, 
Oeb I 
J-ohnny, I 
hardly knew ye. 
Where is your eye that looked so wild, ahoo, ahoo, 
When nay poor heart ye first beguiled, ahoo, ahoo, 
Why did you skedaddle from me and the child? 
Och I 
Johnny, I 
hardly knew ye. 
Vid your drums, etc. 
Ye haven't an arm, yes haven't a 
leg. ahoo, ahoo, 
Ye're an eyeless, noseless, chickenless egg, ahoo, 
ahoo,

JOHNNY, I HARDLY KNEW YE, 
Yell have to be put with a 
bowl to beg. 
Oeh 1 
Johnny, .1 
hardly knew ye. 
Vid your drums, etc. 
Where is the leg with which you run, alio°, ahoo, 
You had it when you went to shoulder a 
gun, ahoo, 
ahoo, 
Arrah, darling dear, your dancing days are done, 
Och 1 
Johnny, I 
hardly knew ye. 
Vid your drums, etc. 
But sad it is to see you so, ahoo, ahoo, • 
And to iee you now an object of woe, ahoo, ahoo, 
Your Peggy will still keep you as her beau, 
Though, Johnny, I 
hardly knew ye.... 
Vid your drums, etc. 
Paddy's Land. 
Composed and sung by Johnny Roach, the successful Irish co-
median. 
Come all ye boys of Paddy's land Who are inclined 
to roam, 
To reap the English harvest so far away from home, 
your're well provided with comrades bold 
and true, 
For you have to fight both day and night 'gainst 
John Bull and his crew. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah, my boys, for Paddy's land, 
'Tis the land I 
do adore; 
May heaven smile on every child 
That. loves that shamrock shore. 
When we left home for Dublin, the morning it.being 
clear, 
And when we got on board the boat we gave three 
hearty cheers, 
flUSH COMIC SONGSTER.

Saying good-bye, my boys, to that dear.old land, we 
ne'er may see it more, 
For we're going to -fight both day and night, all for 
, 
that shamrock shore. 
Then hurrah, etc. 
We sailed away from Dublin Quay, and ne'er receiv-
ed a 
shock, 
Until we landed in New York long side of the 
dock, 
Where thousands of our countrymen they were all 
in that town, 
And faga ballagh clear the track, were the words 
that passed all round. 
Then hurrah, etc. 
Then away we went in merriment to drink strong 
ale and wine, 
Each lad be gave his favorite toast for the girl he 
left behind, 
We sat and sang, made the ale-house ring, despising 
Erin's foes, 
Or any man that hates the land where St. Patrick's 
shamrock grows. 
Then hurrah, etc. 
The Irish Boy's Lament.

JOHNNY, 
I HARDLY KNEW YE, 
It will break my heart from you to part, astore, 
acushala mach ree, 
But I 
must go full of grief, and woo to the shores 
of America. 
CHORUS. 
So now farewell, I 
can no longer dwell 
At home acushala machree, 
But I 
must go full of grief and woe 
To the shores of America. 
On the Irish soil my father lived since the days of 
Erin Banoo. 
They paid their rent and lived content, convenient 
to Mildew, 
But a 
landlord cruel gave us the shuel, my poor old 
mol her and me, 
We had to leave our home, far away to roam, and. 
come to America. 
So now, etc. 
No more in the old church- yard, astore, on my fath-
er's grave shall I 
kneel, 
But the tyrant knows but little of the woes that a 
poor boy has to feel: 
When I 
look around on that little spot of ground 
where the cabin used to be, 
I 
could curse the laws that gave me cause to come 
to America. 
So now, etc." 
Oh, where are the neighbors kind and true that 
was once our country's pride, 
No more they are seen at the fair on the green, or 
the danee by the green hill side. 
'Tis a 
stranger's row that is grazing now where the 
cabin used to be, 
IRISH COMIC SONGSTER.

With notice they were served to be turned out :
Ind 
starved, or come to America. 
So now, etc. 
Oh, Erin Machree, must your children be exiled all 
over the earth, 
Must they think no more of you, astere, of the 
land that gave them birth, 
Must the Irish yield like the beasts of the field, no, 
no, acushla machree. 
They are going away in ships with vengeance on 
their lips to return from America. 
So now, etc.

Six Magnificent Bricks. 
As sun- by Johnny Itoach with great svoess. 
Myself and some friends, once thinking there'd be 
no harm, 
Went for a'walk down town, arm-in-arm, 
The night it was dark, the street it. was_very calm, 
'When we_went out for a 
spree. 
said Jones, now do what I 
tell you, boys, hurrah, 
hurrah, 
Louder still for that ain't half a

JOHNNY, I HARDLY KNEW YE, 
A 
lot more fellows all joined in our little game, 
As we went out for a 
spree. 
Here we stopped a 
minute to bawl hurrah, hurrah, 
The others replied at once to the call, hurrah, hur-
rah, 
Then we struck up the bagpipes once again to let 
the people see 
That we six magnificent bricks had made hp our 
minds for a 
spree. 
Ah, ab, ah, etc. 
Going along we went down a 
narrow street, 
A 
party of coppers out marching we did chance to 
meet, 
They took us to the station house just by the way 
of a 
treat, 
To heighten the joy of our spree. 
But we were determined to keep our pluck, hurrah, 
hurrah, 
So we gave another by way of good luck, hurrah, 
hurrah, 
Then we struck up our bagpipes in our cell to let 
the coppers see 
That we six magnificent bricks had made up our 
minds for a 
spree. 
Ah, ah, ah, etc. 
The other chaps locked in the station began io 
shout, 
Inspector lie couldn't make out what the row was 
about, 
He ordered the coppers again to turn us out, 
And not come in there for a 
spree. 
We were shoved out of the station house door, hur-
rah, hurrah, 
So just for joy we gave one cheer more, lauqah, 
hurrah,

As sung by Johnny Roach, with great success. 
Oh, I

Nor nothing else, I 'spose— 
Misfortune seems to follow me 
Where'er abouts I

Forever in the mud 
Of misery to be stuck.

spose that when I 
dies, 
From Satan I'll be driven, 
And made to wander all alone, 
Outside the walls of Heaven; 
With no one there to take me in, 
Like a 
true friend to greet me. 
And nary one to cheer me up, 
And not 's. soul to treat me 1

The Hungry Army. 
As sung by Johnny Roach, the great Irish comic. 
When I 
was young and in my prime, 
I 
thought I'd go and join the line, 
And, as a 
soldier, cut a 
shine. 
In a 
lot called the Hungry Army. 
Said Ohl sergeant, " You're just the chap," 
And placed a 
knapsack on my back; 
They sent me off to Ballarat, 
To fight in the hunrgy army. 
CHORUS. 
Sound the bugle, blow the horn! 
Fight for glory, night and morn, 
Hungry soldiers, ragged and torn, 
Just returned from the army. 
March, boys, march, the way is on before us, 
Shout, boys, shout I 
and join in the chorus. 
March, boys, march, the foe is still advancing. 
Cheer, boys, cheer, for the new and happy lanct 
I 
went to drill on one fine day, 
The wind was rather strong that way, 
In fact in it blew us all away, 
Tnis glorious hungry army. 
I've got a 
medal, as you see, 
The Fenian brotherhood presented it to me 
For hanging to a 
rotten tree, 
When the win41 took the hungry army. 
Sound the hug* du. 
IS 
TOIINNY, I HARDLY KNEW YE, 
They cut my hair with a 
knife and fork, 
And curled it with a 
cabbage stalk, 
And fed me on some cabbage broth, 
To fight in the hungry army. 
They served it out in a 
large tin can, 
A 
teaspoonful to every man, , 
To fight in the htingry army. 
Sound the bugle, etc. 
They sent me out to drill recruits, 
But they kicked me with their hobnailed boots. 
Oh, take—oh take away these brutes, 
Of this glorious hungry army I 
Now, kind friends, I 
must be off— 
I 
think I 
smell the mutton broth, 
Here comes General Howle, and staff,

My name was Joseph Molder, and I'd go and be a

And return a

JOHNNY, I HARDLY KNEW YE, 
I 
took her to the Bowery, to Chatham Street—a 
place where we did dine. 
I 
treated her to oysters, to lager beer, and wine, 
Then quietly I 
asked her if she would marry poor 
Joe Molder: 
"Oh no," she said, " not for Joe, I'd rather have a 
soldier 1" 
Cruel Mary, etc. 
To my feelings she gave such a 
shock, then such a 
shock, then such a 
shoek, 
It was just striking four by the clock there when 
she left me at the bank— 
I 
wrote to her if anything happened me, she had 
herself to thank. 
Then I 
walked down to the river, and stood out on 
the bank, 
But I 
resolved to go once more, and try and be a 
soldier— 
Return a 
colonel, or perhaps a 
brigadier, and make 
her Mrs. Molder.

Standing on the Platform.

Going down to Long Branch, one fine day,

I

A 
sight which turned my brain. 
For there I 
saw a 
charming girl, 
The prettiest I'd ever seen ; 
Her voice was sweet, her dress was neat, 
She was a 
fairy queen.

considered myself very lucky that I 
happened to be—

met this darling girl who winked at me so plain. 
Bright blue eyes 80 sparkling, teeth were pearly

She was just the pink of fashion, and just the girl 
you'd like. 
"Pray, sir, can you tell me how long the train 
will be?" 
Said I, " I'll ask the guard." 
"I thank you for your kindness, sir," said she. 
And looked at me so hard.

The morning dawned on heavy night, and I 
went

I 
sought my love in England, and brought her o'er

happy man, a 
happy wife, to bless my home and 
me,

And sit beneath my own oak-tree with proud, yet 
grateful heart, 
The children smiling round the board ne'er ask for

Sure, I've sung ye many a

But now ye want something new; 
So I'm afther giving a 
bit of a 
rhyme, 
Concerning an Irish shtew; 
For, I've got the original ould resate 
For cooking to rights that same, 
And if ye can only get hould o' the mate, 
If ye sphoil it, yersilf's to blame.

CHORUS. 
And let rue give ye this bit of advice— 
Ye can very soon prove it's true— 
That nothing in life is half so nice 
As a 
savory Irish shtew. 
In choosing your mate, don't " cut it too fat," 
Nor by ony manes over lean; 
For, the koincl o' mutton that plazes Pat 
Is—a 
sort o' betwixt and betwane. 
Your pertaties should be of the mealy sort, 
And your onions sound and swate; 
And it's pale 'em, and wash 'em, and slice 'em, 
yez ought. 
And pop 'em both in with the mate. 
So let me, etc. 
Then pepper and salt, and sason to taste— 
Och ! the mather, I'd most forgot— 
pour in—just enough—if ye schwamp it the laste 
Be jabers, 
sphoil the lot! 
Then yez can sit down, and watch the pot boil, 
Till the mate's done thoroughly through, 
And yell soon be rewarded tor all your toil, 
By a 
savory Irish shtew. 
So let me, etc. 
There are curious paple in this rum world, 
And curious things they do, 
But I 
never yet saw a 
man turn up 
His nose at an Irish stet/. 
Yes, sure it's a 
faste that is fit for the gods, 
Who envy this mortal taste; 
They've got all the ingradients, but what's the 
odds, 
If they haven't the right resate? ,

The Hardy Gurdy Man. 
As sung by James H. McGuire, the great sensational comic. 
I 
am not so very happy, nor I 
am not so very sad; 
So, put me down as middling, tho' it really is too 
bad, 
For any girl to serve a 
chap the way that I've been 
served, 
I'll never be served so again—for I'll never take 
their word. 
A 
girl I 
courted for six months, her Christian name 
was Fanny. 
When I 
asked her if she would marry me, she 
said she would be glad; 
But at present her intention was to stop at home 
with mamma, 
And she couldn't think of parting from her dear 
old darling dad. 
CHORUS. 
She said it would break her heart for to go and 
leave her mammy, 
She said it would break her heart to leave her 
poor old dad. 
But now she's gone from home, has this false, de-
ceitful Fanny, 
And she travels about the country with a 
hurdy-
gurdy man. 
Now Fanny was not handsome, but I 
thought she 
was sincere ; 
And then she had such winning ways, which made 
me her revere; 
Till a 
hurdy-gurdy grinder, he chanced to pass that 
way, 
And for Fanny's recreation, for hour. lie would 
play. ,

I 
often gave a 
steaver to this nasty, low- bred 
man, 
Who said he was an orphan, which caused me him 
to pity, 
But I 
never thought he'd cheek enough to run 
away with Fan. 
She said, etc. 
Her father and her mother they were very fond of 
me, 
And often they invited me my Fanny for to see. 
I 
found her father ' bacca, and I 
found her mother 
rum, 
And on Fanny I 
invested a 
pretty tidy sum. 
Now, Fanny was a 
girl I 
always thought so well of, 
When I 
think how she served me, it my peace 
of mind destroys. 
Of Mother Cummins' kids I've often heard her tell 
of, 
But I 
never thought she'd run away with the 
biggest of her boys. 
She said, etc. 
When her father told me that Fan had cut her 
stick, 
I 
felt as if I 
had received a 
blow from half a 
brick; 
Now Fanny was a 
girl I 
thought a 
little more pride 
had,

A 
curious tale I

To all of you, as I 
was told, 
About a 
soldier, stout and bold, 
Whose wife, ' twas said, was an arrant scold 
At Waterloo he lost an arm, 
Which gave him pain, and great. alarm, 
Eut he soon got well, and grew quite calm, 
For a 
shilling a 
day was a 
sort ot balm. 
The story goes, on every night 
his wife would bang him let and right; 
So he determined, out of spite, 
To have an erm, cost what it might! 
He wene at once, strange it may seem, 
To have one made to work .by steam; 
For, a 
ray Of hope began to gleam, . 
That force of arms would win her esteem. 
5 
56 
JOHNNY, I HARDLY KNEW YE, 
The limb was finished and fixed unto 
His stump of a 
shoulder, neat and true; 
You'd have thought it there by nature grew, 
For it stuck to its place as tight as glue. 
He started home, and knocked at the door; 
His wife her abuse bagan to pour: 
He turned a 
small peg—and, before 
She'd time to turn, she fell on the floor. 
With policemen, soon, his room was filled, 
But every one he nearly killed: 
For the soldier's arm had been so drilled, 
That, once in action, it couldn't be stilled. 
They took him, at length, before the mayor— 
His arm kept moving all the while there; 
The mayor cried, " Shake your fist if you dare I" 
When the steam arm knocked him out of his 
chair. 
He was locked in a 
cell from doing harm, 
To satisfy those who had still a 
qualm; 
When, all at once, they heard an alarm— 
Down fell the walls, and out popped the arm, 
He soon escaped, and reached his door, 
And knocked, by steam, raps half a 
score:, 
But, as the arm in power grew more and more, 
Bricks, mortar, and wood, soon strew the floor. 
7e left his home, at length, outright, 
,knd wanders now just like a 
sprite; 
i'or he can't get sleep, either day or night, 
And his arm keeps moving with twe-herse 
might,

Bathing. 
As sung by Charles Bahler, the great serio-comie. 
One quiet afternoon, in the latter part of June, 
My employer said, " James I'll dispense with 
Your service from to-day, tor a 
fortnight go away; 
Here's a 
fitly for defraying the expense with." 
How nice it is to go, just, for a 
week or so, 
From town to ease the mind from toil and slav-
ing; 
Along the hills to scramble, and in the waters gam-
bol, 
To enjoy a 
little clean and wholesome bathing. 
I 
was a 
single man, and my sweetheart, Mary Ann, 
In the country lived ( the daughter or a 
farmer;) 
So, natural enough, next morning with a 
puff, 
I 
was soon locked in the embrace of my charmer. 
She met me at the train, and how can I 
explain 
My ecstacy, or how I 
was behaving ? 
But was kissing away, when I 
heard an old man say, 
" 
To cool his love he'd better try some bathing." 
So next morning I 
arose, and the weather being 
close, 
Determined on a 
dipping in the river. 
So, I 
told the servant maid, that I 
going was to 
bathe, 
And at eight o'clock I'd be returning thither. 
Two hundred yards I 
swam from the spot where I 
began, 
To an island—when, for breath I 
almost craving, 
From the water up arose, turned round to find my 
clothes, 
But all had disappeared while I 
was bathing,.

JOHNNY, I HARDLY KNEW YE, 
I shaking was like leaves, when I 
saw the nasty 
thieves, 
I 
shouted out, " You sacrilegious wretches, 
Take my coat, my boots, and hat, satin vest and 
silk cravat, 
Bat for decency do bring me back my breeches !" 
But, all was no avail, they were off and in full sail. 
Not e'en a 
pair of socks could I 
be saving. 
When my troubles on to force, in a 
boat gent across 
Pulled two ladies to the spot where I 
was bath-
ing. 
Oh I 
judge of my surprise, I 
could scarce believe 
my eyes, 
When I 
saw that one was Mary, my intended. 
I 
was dumb, I 
had no choice—if I 
spoke she'd know 
my voice, 
And look a 
thing that ought to be prevented. 
So I 
dodged around the is'e, till a 
quarter of a 
mile 
Stood between me and the boat, I 
almost raving; 
When, agreeable to view, and by chance most 
lucky too, 
I 
saw another individual come bathing. 
I 
soliloquized: Here goes, I 
must have a 
suit of 
clothes, 
Or they'll raise a 
hue and cry for Mary's lover. 
So in I 
plunged once more, and swam toward the 
shore, 
And took his— for one good turn deserves an-
other. 
He saw me in the fact, and I 
scarce knew how to 
act 
To get out of the dilemma I 
was braving. 
So away I 
quickly ran, saying, " Cat ch 
me 
if you 
can," 
But he couldn't in the state that he was bathing.

IRISH COMIC) SONGSTER. 
Like a 
tiger home I 
tore, kept knocking at the door, 
The servant she refusing to admit me. 
While creating these alarms, I 
rushed in Mary's 
arms, 
In a 
suit of corduroys that didn't fit me. 
I 
very soon explained why I 
had been detained, 
And was laughing, though the theft was most 
depraving, 
When a 
man wrapt in a 
sheet, and with nothing on 
his feet, 
Came and asked to see the gent who'd been out 
bathing. 
Said Mary, " Dear, it's true, this man is in-._ . ng 
you, 
wish I'd known what made you stay away. 
I 
saw you all the while, you were dodging round 
the isle; 
But to tell the truth, I 
didn't like to say so." 
So the stairs I 
stumbled down, while I 
nearly broke 
my crown, 
And apologized for rudely thus behaving. 
But now rob me if you can, for I'm since '
a married 
man, 
And Mary Minds my clothes when I 
go bathing.

Call Her Back and Kiss Her. 
As sung by George Melville, the successful comic jocalist. 
There's nothing half so charming 
As a 
happy married life, 
And nothing so alarming 
As a 
vixen for a 
wife; 
But as you make your bed, 
So on it you must lie; 
'Tis useless then to make a 
fuss— 
Take my advice, don't try. 
60 
JOHNNY, I HARDLY ENEW YE, 
CHORUS. 
A 
woman's sure to go her way; 
But when she's gone, we miss her; 
So if you've had an angry word, 
Why, call her back and kiss her. 
A 
wife will surely rule the roost, 
Of course, that's very proper, 
And if she means to rule you, too, 
I 
don't think you can stop her. 
Be never cruel, always kind, 
Do nothing that will tease her, 
And if you wish to happy live, 
You'll do your best to please her. 
A 
woman's, etc. 
A 
woman's sure to have her way, 
For that we cannot blame her; 
The remedy I 
all! then I 
say, 
'Tis kindness that will tame her. 
Be always gentle, never harsh, 
And mind you do 'not flout her; 
And remember you're but helpless men, 
And cannot do without her. 
.A woman's, etc. 
That woman is our greatest joy, 
Let every man reflect; 
Don't treat her as a 
worthless toy, 
Nor slight her with neglect; 
If you possess a 
woman's love, 
What more does any need ? 
In sickness, or in health she'll be 
A 
comforter indeed. 
A 
woman's, etc. 1

Stand by My Friend. 
As sung by George Melville, the successful comic vocalist 
As on we go through life's career, 
How many have to rough it ? 
While one gives us a 
friendly hand, 
A 
dozen try to buffet; 
Still let's be faithful where we can, 
A 
helping hand to lend; 
My maxim is that come what may, 
I 
will stand by my friend! 
My maxim, etc. 
When well to do in life, 
We all a 
ready welcome get: 
It's " How do you do, to- day, my boy? 
I'm glad that we have met." 
But if in our career through life, 
Bad luck does us attend, 
How few will give a 
hand and say: 
I 
will stand by my friend! 
How few, etc. 
A 
friend in need is one indeed, 
His heart and hand he lends; 
Bow different where we have to say: 
Oh I 
save us from our friends! 
'With many, friendship's but a 
name, 
No sympathy they lend, 
They bid good-day, but never say: 
1 
will stand by my friend. 
They bid, etc. 
Little minds triumph over the errors of men of 
genius, as an owl rejoices at an eclipse of the sun.

JOHNNY, I HARDLY IC..NEW YE, 
Always Gay and Free, Boys. 
As sung by Georgs Melville, the successful comic vocalist. 
I'm always gay and free, my boys, wherever I 
may 
go; 
A 
fig for every grief, I 
sav, and every petty woe; 
I 
laugh at what the world calls care, am always 
gay and free— 
Look always on the brighter side, that is the style 
for me. 
CHORUS. 
I'm always gay and free, boys. 
Happy as can be, boys; 
That's the style for me, boys, 
I'm always gay and free. 
The fleeting years go swiftly by, and life is but a 
span, 
To treat its troubles lightly is by far the better 
plan; 
Brave hope will cheer us on our way, on land or 
stormy sea— 
Look always on the brighter side, that is the style 
for me. 
I'm always gay, etc. 
Though troubles often bore us, and the world seems 
dark and drear, 
We've better days before us, if we only persevere; 
Behind life's darkest cloud, a 
silver lining we may 
see— 
Look always on the brighter side, that is the style 
for me. 
I'm always gay, etc. 
IRISH COMIC SONGSTER. 
Though gay and free, as I 
have said, you always 
may depend 
That I 
will do my best to soothe the troubles of a 
friend 
A kindly word works wonders, I'm sure you will 
agree— 
Look always on the brighter side, that is the style 
tor me. 
I'm always gay, etc. 
The Wild Irish Boy. 
As sung by Miss Connoly. 
Farewell to the dear land I 
leave far behind I 
Farewell to my father, although he be b;ind I 
Shall I 
ever forget him, while my heart beats with 
joy ? 
For he called me his darling, the Wild Irish Boy. 
For he called me his darling, the Wild Iriah Boy. 
When I 
came to this country, I 
had brogues on my 
feet, 
And corduroy breeches; although I 
looked neat, 
Yet the boys they all laughed at me, which to me 
was a 
joy— 
For they called me the hero, the Wild Irish Boy. 
For they called me the hero, the Wild Irish Boy. 
There is one they'll remember, and never forget,— 
'Tis Washington's dear friend, the bold Lafayette, 
Who gave fortune and all, not wishing for fame; 
For he dearly loved freedom, and Washington's 
name. 
For he dearly loved Freedom and Washington's 
name.

JOHNNY, I HARDLY KNEW YE. 
I'll send for my parents, and they will come here. 
To a 
land filled with plenty, and a 
land they love 
dear; 
For I 
know they will bless me, while their hearts 
beat with joy, 
For they called me their own son, their Wild Irish 
Boy: 
For they called me their own son, their Wild Irish 
Boy. 
There's the land of my kindred I'll never forge ; 
For the time it may dome when it will be happy 
yet. 
Would to God it were now, for %would give me 
great joy 
For to gaze once more on it, though a 
Wild Irish 
Boy. 
For to gaze once more on it, though a 
Wile. Irish 
Boy.
