Interview with Rosa Herrera, June 9, 2017. 
[00:00] Introductions. Originally from San Sebastian in El Salvador. Many Salvadorans who live 
in the New Bedford area work in the fishing industry. Life in El Salvador is very hard. As a 
single mother she decided to come to America. She left her three small daughters behind. 
[09:26] First job in America was in the fishing industry, it was a very different change from 
working in El Salvador and had to adapt to the working environment. Now 13 years later she has 
adapted her whole life to America and does not wish to return to El Salvador. 
[15:00] Began working in scallops, separating them by sizes and packaging them to be sold. She 
prefers working with scallops than fish. After this job she spent a while unemployed. A while 
later she worked at a small company that was also a scallop company where she had the same job 
in sorting scallops. She now works at a different company with cleaning fish for 6 years. 
[19:15] She now works cleaning cod fish. They use machines to clean the fish, the she uses a 
knife and her hands to clean the rest of the fish. She works the night shift that is focused on cod. 
During the day the company processes other kinds of fish. She works in a work crew that ranges 
from 35 to 40 persons. 
[25:00] To learn the skills needed it took her some time. She was taught by her supervisor at 
work. In the beginning the job is hard to learn but afterwards it becomes easier. The supervisor 
was very patient with new employees. The only thing is you must meet your requirements; if you 
are slow they will let you know. You have to be fast and thorough with your work. 
[32:35] At work sometimes there is a competitive environment, trying to see who cleans and 
finishes more fish during a time to meet quota even though they are paid by hour not by 
production. The most interesting part of the job is everything because she has learned the skills 
needed she is very comfortable with the job. She does wish to work during the day instead of the 
night time. 
[38:15] During the spring there is usually more work, the work week increases to 50 hours a 
week. Work week can go as low as 10 hours weekly when production is not needed. During the 
summer the company also does calamari production. They separate the calamari by sizes aiming 
to get the smaller ones. Squids tentacles are not cut, they only cleaned similar to crab legs. This 
summer she has not processed any squid yet. 
[42:35] Discusses different wages between employees. Talks about gender differences in the 
work area. Men are usually given more hours than the women. Talks about diversity of cultures 
in work environment. 
[52:51] Views on changes in the fishing industry throughout her years working. Advice shared 
for anyone considering joining the fishing industry. Wishes to continue working in the same 
seafood company for years to come. Family members tell her to change jobs because of her age 
but she likes her job. Closing remarks.
