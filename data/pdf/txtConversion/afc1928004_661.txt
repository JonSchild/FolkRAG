To a

Where the blest fore'er inherit 
All a 
Father's holy love. 
CIIORtis. 
And where yonder ivy creeps 
'Tis the place where Garfield sleeps.

When the night of death came o'er, 
And his eyes began to close, 
happy dreams went on before, 
Leaving him to sweet repose.

And where yonder ivy creeps 
'Tis the place where Garfield sleeps.

WHEN 
THE LEAVES BEG-IN TO TURN. 
WALTZ SONG. 
W HEN tne leaves begin to turn, 
And the summer days have passed, 
When the roses droop and die, 
killed by winter's'chilling blast, 
Theii the heart is ()Mimes sad 
When in thought I'm o'er the sea, 
But I 
know he will return— 
My love who loves but me. 
Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, now my song shall ever be, 
Oh ! waft front o'er the sea, 
My love who loves but me. 
Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, now my song shall ever be, 
Oh, bring him safe to me. 
Ali—when the leaves begin to turn, 
And the summer days have passed, 
When the roses droop and die, 
Killed by winter's chilling blast, 
Then the heart is ofttimes sad 
When in thought l'm o'er the sea, 
But I 
know he will return— 
My love who loves but me. 
Oh, what would this life be 
Should hope now forsake me ? 
Surely he'll return to me— 
My love who loves but me, 
N.o, it shall not grieve me, 
lie will not deceive me, 
Deceive me, my love who loves but me, 
My love who loves but me. 
Ah—when the leaves, 
When the leaves begin to turn, 
At —when the leaves begin to turn, 
And the summer days have passed, 
When the roses droop and die, 
Killed by winter's chilling blast, 
Then the heart is ofttime sad 
When in thought I'm over the sea, 
But I 
know he will return— 
My love who loves but me, 
When the leaves begin to turn, 
When the leaves begin to turn.

A WARRIOR BOLD . 
The music of this Song is published by E. II. H ARDING, 229 Bowery, 
New York. Price 10 cents. 
IN 
days of old, when knights were bold, 
And barons held their sway, 
A warrior bold, with spurs of gold. 
Sang merrily his lay, 
Sang merrily his lay. 
My love is young and fair, 
My love hath golden hair, 
And eyes so blue, and heart so true, 
That none with her compare; 
So what care I 
tho' death be nigh, 
I'll live for love, or die. 
So this brave knight, in armor bright, 
Went bravely to the fray; 
He fought the tight, but ere the night 
his soul had passed away, 
Ms soul had passed away. 
The plighted ring he wore 
Was crushed and wet with gore, 
Yet ere he died, he bravely cried, 
" 
I've kept the vow I 
swore; 
So 
what care I 
tho' death be nigh— 
I've fought for love, and die." 
The Music of this Song is published by T. B. HARMS & Co., 819 Broad-

JENNY, my own true loved One,

Jenny, when far from thee, love, 
I'm on the ocean deep, 
Will you then dream of me, love, 
Will you yom promise keep? 
And I 
will come to you, darling. 
Take courage, dear, and never sigh, 
Gladness will follow sorrow— 
Wait till the clouds roll by.

DAT DEAR OLD HOME IN DE SOUTH: 
On, dat dear old home in de South, 
Dar's whar I 
lived when I

Oh, dem was de happy days for me, 
But dey's sad since old massa set me free; 
For dis poor old darkey has no home— 
No place dat he can call his own. 
Oh, my work on dis earth will soon be done 
For de sands of dis life am nearly run. 
Dat dear old home, dat dear old home, 
De place where I 
lived when I

Oh, dem was de happy days for me, 
But dcy's sad since oh massa set me free. 
Ise going back to that old sunny South,

welcome for me dere; 
No more will dis poor old nigger roam 
Far away from de dear old folks at home 
I 
will sing and shout for joy 
When I 
see de place whar I 
lived when a 
boy 
Den happy I'll lay me down and die, 
And meet dem all in heaven by and by. 
THE MEETING. 
Written and sung by LAWELL and BREWS. 
On, down in yon silvery glen, 
Near the gentle running stream, 
Among those flowers blooming sweet, 
I 
wander there to dream. 
My darling loved one dwells within 
An ivy covered cottage near the brook ; 
Her voice is fall of melody, 
Her eyes a 
tender look. 
CHORUS. 
She has promised for to meet me here, 
She has won my heart completely, 
We will play the banjo and guitar, 
And blend our voices sweetly. 
(
Repeat.) 
It's time that she was meeting me 
She said she'd come at eight, 
And meet me underneath that tree, 
As the birds sing to their mate. 
My darling all proclaim so fair, 
A 
fragrant blooming flower, 
She has promised to wed me, I 
declare, 
'Mid Cupid's shining bower. 
She has promised, etc.

OVER THE GARDEN WALL. 
O, my love stood under the walnut tree, 
Over the garden wall. 
She whispered and said she'd be true to me, 
Over the garden wall. 
She'd beautiful eyes and beautiful hair, 
She was not very tall, so she stood on a 
chail 
And many a 
time I 
have kissed her there, 
Over the garden wall. 
CHORUS. 
Over the garden wall, 
'The sweetest girl of all, 
There never was yet such eyes of jet, 
And you may bet I'll never forget 
The night our lips in kisses met, 
Over the garden wall. 
But her father stamp'd, and her father raved, 
Over the garden wall, 
And like an old madman he behaved, 
Over the garden wall. 
She made me a 
bouquet of roses red, 
But immediately I 
popped up my head, 
He gave me a 
bucket of water instead, 
Over the garden wall. 
Over the garden wall, etc 
One day I 
jumped down on the other side, 
Over the garden wall, 
And she bravely promised to be my bride, 
Over the garden wall.. 
But she screamed in fright, ' Here's father, quick ! 
I 
have an impression he's bringing a 
stick 
But I 
brought the impression of half a 
brick 
Over the garden wall. 
Over the garden wall, etc. 
But where there's a 
will there's always a 
way, 
Over thi:gardeu wall. 
There's always a 
night as well as a 
day, 
Over the garden wall. 
We hadn't much money, but weddings are cheap, 
So while the old fellow was snoring asleep, 
With a 
lad and a 
ladder she managed to creep 
Over the garden wall. 
Over the garden wall, etc.

BABY'S GOT A TOOTH . 
Sung by JAca- CONIW Y. 
I'M the father of a 
bouncing boy, 
He looks just like his pa; 
He's the picture of his mamma, 
And the image of his da-da. 
He was eight months old the other day, 
And is a 
noble youth; 
He has set us almost crazy 
Since he got his first front tooth. 
CHORUS. 
George, dear! George, dear! 
Can't you guess the trUth? 
George, dear! George, dear! 
Bless the little youth! 
Do get up and light the fire; 
Turn the gas up a 
little higher; 
Go and tell your aunt Maria 
Baby's got a 
tooth. 
I 
went home late the other night, 
And soon was sound asleep, 
When suddenly I 
was awoke 
By screams that made me weep; 
My wife she grabbed me by the arm, 
And says, " Get up, you brute, 
The pride and joy of all of us - 
Has got a 
nice front tooth." 
George, dear, etc. 
Now, married men, take my advice, 
When first you do get wed, 
Don't ever try to go to sleep, 
Don't ever go to bed; 
But save yourself from trouble 
With the darling little pet; 
Don't wait until he gets a 
tooth; 
Buy him a 
nice false set. 
George, dear, etc.

THE IVY-COVERED COTTAGE BY 
THE STREAM. 
Written by LEw Dnr.ws expressly for Jimmy LOWRV. 
W HERE the dewdrops are falling in the flowery dell 
And the song of the bird strikes your ear, 
There in a 
pretty cottage a 
maiden does dwell, 
My darling, to me she's ever dear; 
A feeling of bliss steals o'er my heart, 
Life's sweetness appears like a 
dream, 
And I 
sigh that my footsteps must ever depart 
From the ivy-covered cottage by the stream. 
cuont -s. 
She's the fairest !lower: (
break) 
She dwells in Cupid's bower; (
break) 
Oh how happy when we're wandering in the eventide, 
Life's sweetness appears like a 
dream; 
I 
will take her to my side, and she shall be my bride, 
In the ivy-covered cottage by the stream. 
Oh the waving of the trees and the babbling of the brook, 
Unmindful of the raptures of the heart ; 
So merrily we'll rove to our pretty wildwood nook, 
And plight our vows of love before we part; 
We listen to the songs of the wild bird as he trills. 
And watch the tiny brook in sunshine gleam, 
She promised to be mine, which caused my heart to thrill, 
While returning to the cottage by the stream. 
Oh she's the fairest. etc. 
ALWAYS KEEP A SMILE FOR MOTHER, 
As sung by J. F. II I:NT, of the Carnival Novelty Company. 
ALWAYS keep a 
smile for mother, 
Never to her harshly speak ; 
Frowns or words in anger spoken 
May bring tears unto her cheek. 
Think of all the kind devotion 
She has given unto you, 
So remember when you greet her, 
Keep a 
smile for mother, do. 
ClIORtiS. 
Always keep a 
smile for mother, 
She is all this world to you, 
There can never be another 
Heart so loving and so true. 
Always keep a 
smile for mother, 
It will cheer her loving heart, 
It will bring again the sunshine 
To the years that now depart. 
Youth and summer- time, sweet roses, 
They have faded from her view, 
Just to bring them back to cheer her, 
Keep a 
smile for mother, do. 
Always keep e 
smile, etc.

MINNIE SLEEPS IN THE O L D 
CHURCHYARD. 
Words and Music by GEO. S. 
CHAItLES, of the Iron City Quartette. 
Sung by ',Ex 
nr, 
s. 
THERE's a 
little green mound in the old churchyard, 
A 
mid under it my darling Minnie sleeps; 
Cherished in my memory is that little spot, 
Over which the willows silent weep. 
Dreary hours are passing, oh how- sad to me, 
Since from my home that little one has gone. 
Never more to hear her tiny voice so sweet, 
As she sang to me her little song. 
Darling Minnie sleeps, sweetly sleeps, 
Sleeps in the old churchyard; 
Cherish 
li d 
in my memory is that little spot, 
Over which the willow- silent weeps, 
(Thfraifi) Where Minnie sleeps. 
.\e_11 do I 
remember that cold December night. 
The night on which my darling Minnie died; 
" 
Mamma, dearest mamma," softly whispered she 
" 
Come and sit by little Minnie's side. 
Don't weep, dear mamma, place my hand in thine 
From all my sufferings soon shall I 
be free; 
Angels now are waiting to waft me to that shore, 
From our little cottage home and thee. 
Darling Minnie sleeps, etc.

IVY OLD KENTUCKY HOME, GOOD-NIGHT. 
Words and Music by S C FOSTER. 
The sun shines bright in the old Kentucky home, 
'Tis summer, the darkies are gay, 
The corn top's ripe and the meadow's in the bloom, 
While the birds make music all the day. 
The young folks roll on the little cabin floor, 
All merry all happy and bright ; 
By'n bye Hard Times comes a 
knocking- at the door, 
Then my old Kentucky Home, good-night I 
CHOICCS. 
Weep no more, my lady, 
Oh ! weep no more to-day I 
We will sing one song for the old Ii:eutucky home, 
For the old Kentucky home, far away. 
They hunt no more for the pssurn and the e2on 
On the meadow, the 1131 and the shore, 
They sing no more by the g1immer of the moon, 
On the bench by the old cabin door. 
The day goes by lIke a 
shadow o'er the heart, 
With sorrow where all was delight ; 
The time has come when the darkies have to part, 
Then my old Kentucky Home, good- night! 
'Weep no more, my lady, &c.

SWEET DAYS GONE BY . 
As sung by J. F. H UNT and LEIN' D-IZEAVS. 
THERE'S hope i 
-1 
the sweet by and by, 
As we're nearing to life's other shore, 
Yet the heart will oft turn with a 
sigh 
To a 
vision of the sweet days gone by, 
When fond memory will bring back again 
Many scenes that our childhood passed by; 
The old home, meadow, brook, and the lane, 
In the time of the sweet days gone by. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, how sweet is the story that's told 
Of the bright sunny days long passed by 
'Tis a 
theme with the heart never old, 
'Tis a 
story of sweet days gone by. 
Still in fancy I 
see the old cot, 
And the ivy around it cloth cling: 
I'll still cling to that neat hallowed spot, 
Of its memories ever I'll sing. 
'Neath its roof aged forms we behold, 
As they both sat the cheering fire by, 
In the time when they loved as of old, 
In the time of the sweet days gone by, 
Oh, how sweet is the story, etc.

I'M LONELY TO-NYir. 
Words and Music by G. W. H. GRIFratt. 
I 
a's lonely to-night, in my sad little chamber, 
While the stars sweetly shine upon all I 
hold dear: 
They- are gone from their home with the bold fearless ranger 
There's a 
void in my heart; for, they are not here. 
Oh why did they leave me alone and deserted, 
To risk their dear lives on the blood-sprinkled plain! 
Sho4ld they never return, this poor heart will soon wither, 
And never know joy or comfort again. 
CHORE'S.

at lonely to-night, but ere Spring-birds shall warble 
Their matinal song in the wild forest-tree, 
And the bright limpid brook with sweet music shall babble 
My heart will grow lighter, while thinking of thee ! 
Then fleet by dull hours, and bring back the loved ones, 
Who parted from frk.:( s 
with a 
tear moistened eye; 
Por, then, this sad heart will no longer be lonely, 
But joyous and happy as the mild azure sky. 
I

Price 10 cents. 
On: father's gone to markct towli— 
ne was up before the day, 
And Jamie's after robins' nests, 
And the man is making hay ; 
And whistling down the hollow goes 
The boy that minds the mill, 
While mother, from the kitchen door, 
Is calling with a 
will: 
Polly! Polly! the cows are in the corn ! 
Polly! Polly! the cows are in the corn! 
From all the misty morning air 
There comes a 
summer sound, 
A murmur, as of weters, cclaes 
From ships, and trees, and ground; 
The birds they sing upon the wing, 
The pigeons bill and coo, 
And over hills and hollows ring 
Again the loud halloo: 
Polly! Polly! the cows are in the corn! 
Polly! Polly! the cows are in the corn! 
How strange at such a 
time of day 
The mill should stop its clatter; 
The farmer's wife is list'ning now, 
And wonders what's the matter. 
Oh! wild the birds are singing in 
The woodland on the hill, 
While whistling up the hollow goes 
The boy that tends the mill. 
Polly! Polly! the cows are in the corn! 
Polly! Polly! the cows are in the corn!

M Y 
mother-in-law's a

She's talked me out of everything I

She's a 
regular old huller, the worst I

I 
hope she'll kick the bucket, very soon. 
She's got eyes like a mackerel, a mouth liks ';1, street

She can look two ways, and never squint, 
Oh, she talks and chins all day, till she couldn't talk no 
more; 
Such a 
terrible talker is my mother-in-law. 
She is hay, she is crazy, 
She can knock the still-ling out of any man, 
She would talk you blind, if you didn't mind, 
Such a 
terrible talker is my mother-in-law. 
Sometimes she makes it lively and goes for my hair, 
And pulls me all around the room. 
I 
wish she was in heaven, or where she couldn't rare, 
She ought to take a 
trip up to the moon. 
Her tongue goes like a 
clapper, it is loose at both ends, 
She has jawed and talked me nearly blind ; 
She is jawing in the morning, through the day, and 
through the night ; 
Such a 
terrible talker is my mother-in-law. 
She is luny, etc.

ARE YOU GOING TO THE MAT THIS AFF ?

Price 35 cents. 
THERE is a 
great sensation about a 
word you hear nowa-
days, 
The boys and girls all use it, it's all about going to the 
Matinees ; 
You can hear them say to each other, when they are 
going past, 
It's either Charles or Emma, " Are you going to the mat 
this aff ? " 
CHORUS. 
" 
Are you going to the mat this aff ?"

"Are you going to the mat this aff ? "

Not this aff; " 
By chance I 
met a 
lady friend, I 
knew for many a 
day, 
I 
went with her a 
walking, and I 
left her on Broadway, 
And the time that we were parting, she winked at me 
and laughed, 
And then said " Good-morning, Harry, are you going to 
the mat this aff ? " 
Are you going to the mat, etc. 
When boys are kissing pretty girls, they don't know 
what to say, 
They commence to give them earaches, of new things out

She'll say, " Don't waste your breath talking, we've heard 
the best and last— 
The latest of the season is, " Are you going to the mat

He's laughing all the day, 
lie laughs at nothing, but he laughs 
At everything you say. 
He also laughs well in his sleep, 
He laughs to see the baby creep,

The only answer that I

Was, he, he, he, he, bee. 
With his ha, ha, ha, etc. 
And when he heard the news from Maine, 
It nearly drove him wild, 
And when we told him how things stood, 
Loudly then he smiled. 
He rolled upon the floor and laughed, 
Till the tears ran down his cheeks, 
We picked him up, put him to bed, 
And now he never speaks. 
With his ha, ha, ha, etc.

THE KICKING HORSE FLY.

Sung by LAWELL and DREWS. 
THERE'S a 
terrible story which I'm going to tell, 
And I 
want you to listen to me 
A 
bullfrog, a 
lobster, and a 
horsefly, they fell 
In a 
mud hole, and sang tra la lee. 
The bullfrog got hungry and tackled the fly, 
The lobster got angry and started to cry, 
When a 
speckled old hen came along that way, 
And hearing the clatter said, " What d'ye say ? 
Now when Mr. Horsefly saw speckled Miss Hen 
Talking in such a 
rude manner to them, 
He got on his ear and started to kick, 
When the lobster and bullfrog took very sick. 
The horsefly did kick at a 
terrible rate, 
He kicked out the frog which the old lien ate ; 
0 , he kicked at the lobster with all his might, 
Then he kicked himself clear out of sight.

THE WEESTLE OF THE CATS. 
Written by JAMES CAMPBELL, and delivered by O'NEIL and CONE', 
with shouts of laughter and applause. 
I\ 
IRS. M ALONEY had a 
cat, and a 
female cat was she, 
Her voice it was a 
soprano, and she sung in the key of G. 
Oh, it was my delight, of a 
starry night, when coming 
home from a 
ball, 
To hear her singing " We met by chance," on the top of 
Maloney's wall. 
I 
know she went up as high as " G," and sometimes she 
went higher, 
And the way she dwelt on the very last note, you'd think 
she was hollering fire ! 
I 
really think she could si:y the word fire ! but still I'll 
not swear to that, 
For I 
wouldn't like to make a 
liar of Mrs. Maloney's cat. 
Now, old Mrs. McFadden, she had a 
Tom (a 
cat I 
mean 
by that name), 
And he called Mrs. Maloney's cat a 
most disrespectful 
name. 
Maloney's cat cried out, " You're another!" then Mc-
Fadden's loudly aid bawl, 
" 
You sucker, send out your big brother, or come your-
self over the wall. 
I'll wrestle you, collar and elbow. I'll throw you as quick 
as a 
rat ! " 
" 
Arrah, don't be getting your back up ! 
say Mrs. 
Maloney's cat. 
Now, Jerry McGill had a 
bull dog, and Jerry, he lived in 
the rear, 
And the bull dog was lean, lank, and hungry, and (Evil 
a 
cat did he fear ; 
Now, Jerry, he called his dog " Boney," says he " Now, 
I'll bet a 
new hat, 
If I 
leave off his chain and his muzzle, he'll make sausage-
meat out of them cats." 
One night (it was dark and dreary, and the divil a 
star 
in the sky), 
Boney had off his chain and his muzzle, and he laid for 
the cats on the sly.

WRESTLE OF THE CATS.—Concluded. 
Now, the cats, they met in the hallway, and they wrestled 
clean out to the yard, 
The first hold was " collar and elbow," and their breath-
ing was terrible hard ; 
Then they both tried " Grfneo Roman ;" you couldn't 
tell who got first fall, 
And 13oney was acting as referee in the shade of the gar-
den wall. 
They howled, and they spit, and they sputtered, and the 
blood from their noses ran, 
Says Bone.)
, " I'll take a new hoult, I'll wrestle them 
catch, catch, can." 
Then, like lightning lie sprang in amongst them, 
In his jaws he had one by the back, 
Such a 
yell was ne'er heard in that quarter, 
As came from Maloney's poor cat. 
McFadden cat fought like a 
tiger, 
But Boney's strength didn't him fail 
With a 
twist of his jaws, like a 
general, 
He bit off :McFadden's cat's tail. 
Oh, the bowling, and. yelling, and growling of the dog 
and the cats filled the air, 
And the windows all round in the barracks flew open 
everywhere. 
Heads with night-caps of old men and old women and 
children, poked out in the dark, 
They thought that the house was on fire ; or the divil 
was out on a 
lark ; 
They tried to look out in the darkness where the noise 
came from, down by the wall, 
And thinking some one was being murdered, they loud 
for the police did bawl. 
Then they came out in droves and in dozens, 
The children, old women and men, 
With candles, with lamps, and with matches, 
But all ! what a 
sight met them then— 
McFadden, and Mrs. Maloney, 
They sorefully shook their night-caps, 
To see McGill's bull dog, old Boney, 
Holding a 
wake over the two defunct cats. 
HOW THE BANJO WAS INVENTED. 
A 
RECITATION. 
By LAWELL and DREWS. 
OH, have yon never heard ? 
How banjos were invented, 
It is the strangest story, 
But to me it was presented.

And why de hair is missin'. 
It's about old Noah and the ark, 
That l'm about to tell you, 
And about that Ham. his big black son, 
And about the snakes and 'possums. 
He had a 
butting billygoat, 
And a 
hundred head of cattle, 
lie drove em ' board the ark as soon's 
He heard the thunder rattle. 
De ark she liep a 
sailin'. 
And a 
sailin', and a 
sailin' ; 
De lion got his dander up, 
And like to break do palin'. 
De sarpints hissed, de painters yelled, 
Till what .with all de fussin', 
ion couldn't hardly hear de mate, 
bo.ssin' round and cussin'. 
Now Ham, de only nigger 
Dat was running on de packet, 
Got lonesome in de barber shop, 
And couldn't stand do racket. 
And so for to amuse hisself, 
He steamed some wood and bent it, 
And soon he had a 
banjo made, 
De fast dat was invented. 
He wet de leather, stretched it on, 
Made bridge, and screws and apron, 
And fitted in a 
proper neck, 
'Twos very long and taperin'. 
He took some tin and twisted him, 
A 
thimble for to ring it, 
And den de mighty question rose, 
How was he gwine to string it ? 
De possum had as fine a 
tail 
As de one dat is'e a 
singing ; 
De hairs so long, and thick and strong, 
De's fit for banjo stringing. 
Dat nigger shaved 'em off as close 
As wash day dinner graces, 
And sorted of 'em, by de size 
From little E's to basses. 
He strung her, tuned her, struck a 
jig, 
'Twos nebber mind de wedder ; 
They sound like forty leven bands, 
Playing all together. 
Some went to pattin', some to dancin', 
Noah called de figures, 
And this is how the banjo was 
Invented by the niggerg,

BEAUTIFUL BEWILDERING FLOWER. 
Written by L. C. DnEws, and sung by LAWELL and DRENTS. 
WirrLE strolling on the avenue to-day, 
I 
met such a 
pretty girl, 
Her face as bright as any day in May ; 
It put my heart in quite it twirl. 
There is none such beauty can disclose, 
When she wakes from blissful dreams at early dawn. 
And the pride of all flowers is the rose, 
She's my beautiful bewildering flower. 
As we walked along together going home, 
My happiness did then and there increase ; 
Our hearts from each other never roam, 
We are happy as the summer morning's breeze. 
Oh, the time when we will happy be, 
Is not far away you bet, 
For she a 
little wife will be to me, 
Oh, how I 
bless the day that e'er we met. 
I 
met her first, 'twas in a 
summer bower, 
And I 
shall not forget her pleasing smile ; 
I 
would have claimed her then, had I 
the power s. 
Oh, my heart she did beguile. 
Then I 
asked her to be mine forever more, 
There came an answer, loving, kind and true, 
As we walked arm and arm through the door, 
She said to me, I 
always will be true.

DEAR mamma, kiss my eyes to sleep,

I

My heart is sore with pain ;

Oh, just a

Dear mamma, kiss my eyes to sleep, 
And cheer your darling chili. 
You know that papa's on the deep, 
The storm is raging wild ; 
I 
hear the surging billows roar, 
His ship is rocked and toss'd 
The wind is blowing to the shore, 
And papa will be lost. 
Dear mamma, etc. 
Dear mamma, kis-, my eyes to sleep, 
And hold me to your breast, 
I'm sorry that I've made you weep, 
But put your mind to rest ; 
Perhaps the clouds will break away— 
The billows cease to roar; 
The morn may bring a 
sunny day, 
And papa safe to shore.

Last week my little wife arid I 
Went for a

And when we re.iched a

We sat down for a

My arms around her waist, I 
spoke 
About our wedded life. 
I

gaping crowd, 
Who yelled—"

I

And in the quiet square,

BANJO SOLO. 
(New Air.) 
Written and composed by Si DEVERZ. 
DECEPTION just now is the rule all around, 
It's practiced in all shades of life ; 
Just mind what I 
say, and be careful, my friends, 
When the time comes to pick out a 
wife. 
Her eyes may be loving, her smile may be sweet, 
When you approach her she's timid and afraid ; 
Be careful, look well before making the leap, 
You don't know how the dear girl is made. 
In the good days of old, in our grand-mothers' time, 
Girls didn't enamel or paint ; 
Didn't wear palpitators their bosoms to swell, 
Didn't lace themselves up till they'd faint ; 
Didn't wear paten calves, or use bloom of youth, 
And the rose in their cheecks didn't fade. 
You must know a 
girl well now before you get stuck, 
For she's fearfully and wonderfully made. 
Girls long ago didn't pencil their brows, 
Use lotions to make the skin fair ; 
The girls long ago combed the hair on their heads, 
Now it's combed on the back of a 
chair. 
I've got snore to tell when I 
see you alone, 
I 
have said too much here I'm afraid. 
But before you get married, examine them well, 
For they're fearfully and wonderfully made.

To the Gentlemen Coons' Picnic.

JAKE DYER loved a 
handsome girl, Maria was her name, 
And took her once to see New York, the country was so 
tame. 
And when she saw the Brooklyn bridge, which was way 
overhead, 
She ope'd her eyes with great surprise, and this is what 
she said— 
CHORUS. 
011, what a 
beauty ! oh, what a 
beauty 
This is what Maria said unto Jake Dyer ; 
Oh, what a 
beauty ! oh, what a 
beauty ! 
I 
never saw the like before, Maria she did say. 
He took her then to Central Park the different things to 
see— 
The lake, the mall, the statues and the great menagerie, 
And when she saw the bear stand up and lean upon a 
cane 
She grabbed his arm in great alarm and to him did ex-
claim— 
Oh, what a 
beauty, etc. 
He took her then to Jerome Park to see the races there, 
The grand stand it was filled with men and women, oh 
so fair, 
And when sloe saw the tally-ho coach it nearly turned 
her head, 
And when they jumped the hurdle gates why this is what 
she said— 
Oh, what a 
beauty, etc. 
Now Jake felt awful when he found that his girl was so 
green, 
And started ere the race was over for to catch a 
train ; 
The p-ople saw the hayseed stiching in Maria's head, 
They laughed and stood up in their seats, and this is 
what they said— 
CHORUS. 
Oh, what a 
beauty ! oh, -what a 
beauty ! 
This is what they holler'd in a 
voice so solid : 
Oh, what a 
beauty ! oh. what a 
beauty ! 
I 
never saw the like before, the people they did say.

Oh, her bright and winning way is so entrancing, 
Joy and pleasure linger here all thro' the day, 
This earth it seems like heaven, 
Our hearts are always light and gay, 
And when my little Dot is singing, 
Sweet music you will hear. 
Oh you should hear her sing, the melody does ring 
Her voice so soft and clear. 
Oh, my she's my belle, eta.

I'VE BEEN DRINKING TO-DAY. 
PARODY ON " 
SLAVERY DAYS." 
Written and sung with great success by BILLY NILES of tho Carnival 
Novelty Company. 
I'VE been drinking to- day of the slops that's thrown 
away 
From all the vile old beer saloons in the land, 
For they know me as a 
beat and of course they never 
treat, 
So I 
think I'll go and join a 
temperance band. 
I 
had a 
bottle of rum, but they said I was a 
bum, 
And locked me up in jail that very night ; 
Oh, they tore us far apart and it nearly • broke my heart, 
When I 
saw that bottle disappear from sight. 
CHORUS. 
Those good old days are gone, 
And my clothes I'll have to pawn, 
And all my friends have given me the shake ; 
In fact I'm all broke up, and I 
never get a 
sup, 
And I 
miss that good old question, " What'll you 
take ? " 
Still my memory will steal o'er to that dear old barroom 
floor, 
Where the bums would sit and spit tobacco juice, 
And as on the stove it fell, it would raise an awful smell, 
You would think a 
whole bone factory had broke loose. 
When the bartender would shout, " You bums, I'll fire 
you out I" 
That was a 
signal for us all to get, 
So towards the door we'd pile with a 
sick and ghastly 
smile, 
For we knew that from the shoulder he did hit. 
Those good old days, etc.

I 
shall never be happy again, 
Till I've gained your good graces, 
And kissed all the men's faces, 
shall never be happy again. 
I 
feel as though water was poured down ray back, 
Or a 
giant had trod on my corn ; 
I 
think till I'm vexed that each moment's my next, 
He caused me to feel so forlorn ; 
I 
oft start to cry, and fancy I'll die. 
Although I 
don't feel any pain ; 
Till tomcats won't fight or rake out at night, 
shall never be happy again. 
CHORUS. 
I 
shall never be happy again, 
I 
shall never be happy again, 
Till Sara Bernhardt 
Shall be cast for my part, 
I 
shall never be happy again. 
iNIy life like a 
flower has been nipp'd in the bud, 
My heart, if I 
own such a 
thing, 
By. woman, fair woman's been broken in bits, 
Eat still to this fair one I 
cling; 
) 
I SHALL NEVER BE HAPPY AGAIN. 
Continued. 
I 
loved her, alas ! but she didn't love me ; 
The feeling is hard to explain ; 
I 
try to throw care to the wind, but I 
feel 
I 
shall never be happy again. 
CHORUS. 
I 
shall never be happy again, 
I 
shall never be happy again, 
Till girls in their teens 
Don't know what love means, 
I 
shall never be happy again. 
Her pa was a 
merchant in muffins and shrimp; 
Her mother, a 
worthy old dame, 
Very often would say in a 
jocular way, 
" 
Our Lucy will soon change her name." 
Alas ! she has changed it, but it was not for mine 
The thought of it drives me insane, 
And till prisoners in jail are all out on bail, 
I 
shall never be happy again. 
CHORUS. 
I 
shall never be happy again, 
I 
shall never be happy again, 
Till the corns on my toes 
Grow bang on my nose, 
I 
shall never be happy again. 
ENCORE CHORUSES. 
I 
shall never be happy again, 
I 
shall never be happy again, 
Till our friend Dr. Tanner 
Lives a 
year on a 
bananner, 
I 
shall never be happy again. 
I 
shall never be happy again, 
I 
shall never be happy again, 
Till Mrs. Hayes thinks 
It is best to mix drinks, 
I 
shall never he happy again.

WHERE THE AUTUMN LEAVES ARE FALL-
ING. 
REFINED SONG AND DANCE. 
Written by L. C. DnEws, and sung with great success by LAWELL & 
DnEws, play in:: their own music on the guitar while dancing. 
WitEx the autumn leaves are falling 
Down in yonder shady grove, 
And I 
hear the cuckoo calling, 
Then and there I'll meet my love. 
Oh, 
wandered far to meet her, 
She'll greet me with a 
call, 
And I'll tell her how I 
love her, 
While the autumn leaves do fall. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my heart with rapture fills 
When I 
hear her sweetly calling ; 
I 
will meet her and I'll greet her 
Where the autumn leaves are falling. 
Oh, she lives in yonder bower, 
Down where the violets grow, 
And she is the fairest flower 
That ever I 
did know ; 
And she's mine, I 
know, completely, 
Her pretty form so tall, 
And she sings to me so sweetly 
Where the autumn leaves do fall. 
Oh, my heart. etc. 
THE FLY MARKET DAME 
A RECITAT;ON. 
Recited with applause by L.A.WELL and DEEWS. 
Nail: Fly Market lived a 
dame, 
She was ugly, squint and lame, 
She had money, and I 
had none, 
So to court her I 
begun. 
I 
went to see her one rainy night, 
And with the rain was drenched thro' quit? 
But the cruel butcher he 
Cut in there, and cut out me. 
To gain this point, he gave a 
ball, 
And I 
was asked with the neighbors all ; 
I 
asked her hand, I 
do declare. 
But she gave me her foot, and I 
won't tell where. 
I 
went again my suit to press, 
And what I 
saw you'll never guess ; 
When I 
got in there, I 
did see 
That she was frying sausages for he. 
Now one kiss before we part, 
For you have broke this faithful heart ; 
Scarcely these words I 
had said. 
When she up with the skillet and broke my head. 
Now all you who for love are sighing. 
Never go courting where sausages are frying, 
Lest like me you feel the weight 
Of the frying pan upon your pate. 
FIFTH AVENUE GEORGE, 
As 
sung by DAN Anctunt of the Carnival Novelty Company. 
FIFTH avenue George is a 
charmer, 
As all the dear creatures will swear, 
Of fashion Fin always the leader, 
NO 
gent with my style can compare. 
I 
lead an existence of pleasure 
while blessed with a 
fortune so large, 
And every one gives the opinion 
There's none like Fifth avenue George. 
CHORUS. 
Fifth avenue George, Fifth avenue George, 
Upon me the girls fondly smile, 
For fun and good cheer to the boys I 
am dear, 
I'm the leader of fashion and style. 
I 
wear a 
Knox hat made to order, 
My diamonds will outvie the sun, 
A 
gold-headed cane I 
keep twirling ; 
As a 
swell I 
am A Number One. 
I 
can waltz like a 
girl in the ballet, 
And sing like a 
signor from Ilcme 
In every grand parlor or ball room 
Fifth avenue George is at home. 
Fifth avenue George, etc, 
I 
think every business is vulgar, 
I 
can't comprehend the hard times ; 
11Iy manner is very romantic, 
And I 
talk about poets and rhymes. 
I 
play philopene with the ladies, 
And flirt with the belles all around ;

SWEET LOUI-..24A LEE. 
REFINED SONG AND DANCE. 
Written and sung by BILLY Nuts of the Carnival Novelty Company. 
How enchanting to be wandering beneath a 
summer sky, 
To listen to the streamlet as it murmurs sweetly by, 
And to hear the little birdies singing ever merrily; 
In such a 
spot I 
gave my heart to sweet Louisa Lee. 
Oh, Louisa ! darling one ! (
Break.) 
My heart you have completely won. (
Break.) 
CHORUS. 
Oh, yes ! I 
love her so ! 
Sweet blue eyes and golden hair, 
Teeth of pearly whiteness, too, 
She's the fairest of the fair. 
Oh, we wandered on together, as the moon in beauty 
shone, 
The little stars were twinkling bright as we were all 
alone, 
A question soft I asked her, as her eyes looked into 
mine, 
Her sweet reply I'll ne'er forget, she answered, " I 
am 
thine." 
Oh, Louisa! darling one ! (
Break.) 
My heart you have completely won. (
Break.) 
9h, yes! I 
love her so, eta.

LN 
a 
cosy little cabin down in Georgia, 
Where the cotton- flowers bloom so fair and white, 
There dwells a 
lovely maiden 
Who is my heart's delight ; 
And at night when the little stars were peeping 
And the moon in all her glory shone above, 
I've often talked of happier days 
With this one sweet girl I 
love.

Where the sweet magnolias bloom, (Bea) 
How I 
love their sweet perfume, (Break.) 
She was walking thro' a 
shady grove of oranges 
'Neath the calm and silver light of the moon, 
I 
told my darling of my love 
Where the sweet magnolias bloom. 
I 
have wandered far away from sunny Georgia, 
That dear old land I 
love to call my home, 
Yet oft my dreams will take me back. 
As thro' the world I 
roam. 
Oh, I 
see the pure white blossoms of the cotton 
As they glisten 'neath the calm and shining moon ; 
That's where I'd like to live and die, 
Where the sweet magnolias bloom.

MY JESSIE DEAR. 
Written by L.

BREWS, and sung with great success by LAWELL & 
DREWS of the Carnival Novelty Company, in their original 
sketch entitled, " Serenaders." 
On, I 
know a 
little dear, she lives right over here, 
Among the flowers blooming in the dell ; 
And she is my beauty bright, also my heart's delight 
And of our happy tales of love we tell. 
Oh, we wander through the valleys, and up the moutain-
side, 
And there we whisper loving words ; 
In the gentle twilight glow we wander to and fro, 
She's my darling, little, blue-eyed Jessie dear. 
So down in this dell we will ever dwell, 
In a 
little cottage near the brook, 
Sitting with my darling in a 
happy dream, 
As long as life shall brightly glide ; 
'Tis where the scent of roses forever fills tlh. 
Will always haunt our years ; 
We will always cling together, my darling On and 
My pretty, little, blue-eyed Jessie dear.

When we meet them on the street we tip our hats ; 
We're a

You may know we are the Colored Autocrats.

We dress up in the very latest style,
