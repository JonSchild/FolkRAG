Shelves of teapots in progress sit in Nishi’s studio in the basement of their home. He has been working on teapots 
during the winter because they provide a good challenge. The black ink marks were used to help decide where to 
place elements such as the spout, handle, or stamp decorations; they will burn off in the firing and will not be part 
of the final decoration of the pot.

A close-up of some of the teapots Nishi has been working on during the winter. The black ink marks were used to 
help decide where to place elements such as the spout, handle, or stamp decorations; they will burn off in the 
firing and will not be part of the final decoration of the pot.

Nishi demonstrates how to hold one of his uniquely-shaped bowls. It has been bisque fired but not glaze fired yet. 
He is wearing a winter jacket because this part of his studio is not heated in winter; he usually only works here 
during warmer times of year.

Bisque-fired ware sits on a table in Nishi’s studio, waiting to be glazed. The segmented pots are meant to hold 
flowers—the segments help with arranging the flowers.

Nishi holds a cup that has been stamped and glazed with two different glazes. The finished pots in the background 
have a different green and black glaze that he also likes to use.

These finished bud vases show some of the variety of decorative techniques that Nishi uses, as well as the range 
of glaze colors.

This photo, provided by Elizabeth Nishitateno, shows Nishi marking a vase with ink. The ink helps him to 
determine where decorations such as stamps will be placed, but the ink itself will burn off in the firing and will 
not be part of the final decoration of the pot.
