like this and he had a big ole gash. He didn't talk to us me no more, you know, no more.
All he would do is just press my hand like that, you know, that's all. So then they called the
ambulance. They already had called the ambulance then. So I just lait with him...Pop lait

were anxious. And the Sister was there after, after...She went in her car, you know. She
followed the ambulance. Then, I was shaking and oooo it was terrible. Then this Fairview
ambulance was parked there. It wouldn't leave. It wouldn't leave because he knew that
that little boy was bad enough to where he was gonna need to be transferred. You know.
'Cuze he head injuries. He was gonna have to be transferred. And they were just getting
started, so they were like solicitating their business, you know. So then while, when
you're in...all shook up like that, you never think twice. The first thing that's right there
quick enough to take him, well, that's why I said go ahead, take him, you know. So that
ambulance... <gap>'s ambulance was gonna take him, so I said, yes, go ahead...anybody
take him. Please, just get him to the hospital quick. So we got in the...in the car you know.
And we took off. We took off to...to...Albuquerque. Then we were going, you know. And
Pop was sittin on this side. John was with him in the back. He was holding him, you know.
And that Johnnie Demarcas and me and Pop and Mr. <unintelligible text>...all four of us
were in the front seat. We were going, he was taking us real fast. And then in the other
side of Santa Fe, the
Tape 80 Page 22
Speaker: ambulance began to go real slow and I kept telling that Mr. Mohan, I says can't
your ambulance go faster? You know? Because John said, O Momma, Momma. And I
lookit back at him and he'd say...he wants to throw up, Momma. And then, I said, let him
throw up. So anyway, we kept goin. But he wouldn't go anymore than forty-five miles
an hour (inaudible). That was slow. Then, finally we were gettin there and it was getting
dark. Then, pretty soon I was telling Pop not to...kinda cool it, I says, you know, be quiet,
so he'd...just say a few prayers for him, I said. Let's, let's pray for him. So all of us were
praying, all of us in the front seat were praying, you know. Then Pop would say, Oh dear
Momma. The lights, somethings are wrong with the lights. And I said, yeh, I know. What's
wrong with your lights, Mr. Mohan. Look, they're not even on, you know. And he says,
Well, I don't know, he says. It's still a little bright outside, he says. Then pretty soon, Pop

says, Don't worry Momma. Look. God's providing us light out there and there was the
moon was shinning so bright, you know. It was already shining then, but the lights were
dim! So we kept going and going. Finally, we (inaudible) and he kept (gasping noise) like
that you know. (Cough) (Cough)...that real funny, you know. John...oh, Momma, he said,
Momma, momma, you know. But he was still...he still...you alright sonny? I kept tellin. Yeh,
he's alright Momma. So we kept going. Then when we got to that...just close to that first
turnoff on San Mateo, you know? Right there, just about a mile, not even a mile, you know,
less than a mile. Well then that darned ambulance just stopped. Just completely stopped.
The red light wasn't going no more. There was no lights in the front, no lights in the back,
no lights nowhere. So then...there's lot of cars passin up you know. Then pretty soon Pop
jumped down. Right away, he didn't even stop to (inaudible) to tell him nuthing. He just
jumped. And he waved them. And the first car that came, stopped. And he tell em, take me
to the first filling station. So I call an ambulance. He says. So then they took him...that car
took him real fast, you know...took him to the first filling station. And he called the
Tape 80 Page 23
Speaker: ambulance from the (inaudible). So they came. Pretty soon we saw the
ambulance coming. But...just before then...he went (gasp). That was it, he died right there.
There's where he died. Then John said, Momma, momma, he said. And then I said, what?
He's gone. And I said, no he's not. And he said, I don't think so, Momma, I don't think so.
He didn't wanna tell me, you know. So then...I was jumping in the middle of (inaudible).
It's a wonder a car didn't hit me! I was in panic! Then, then Mr. Lujan told me to kinda cool
down. So just then, the ambulance came. We couldn't take him from the back part of the
ambulance because it was locked. See, it ran battery. So we couldn't take him out through
there. So they have to take him out through the side, like that. But he was already gone.
Then...then Pop didn't know what to do, you know. And they got him in the ambulance.
John went in the ambulance. And then there was a man from somewhere he said, come
on, Lady, he says...come one. And that other lady - his wife I guess it was - and got Pop

and we put us in the car and we followed the ambulance to....then we went to got to
<unintelligible text>, those people stayed there. Then we sat there and Dr. <gap>, you
know, she went and she came out. They took him in. They checked him over right fast,
and he was gone though. So then he, she came out and she called us together and she
said, I'm sorry, but he's gone. Oh, My God, it looked like they hit us with a ton a rocks. Just
a ton a rocks. But Pop kept hitting his head on the wall. And John just didn't know what
to do. I didn't know what to do. Just then, Father. Where Father came from, dear Lord, I, I
don't know. But he walked in to the room and he sat us down. He calmed us down. And he
prayed. He asked us to pray. He gave us communion, he gave us confession, he said not
to worry because he had given the Last Rites to Danny and he had given him communion.
And he says, and...then I told him, well he already had that over here...right there at the
road, you know. So then, he sat down and he cried and he explained to us. By that time
the nurse was in there. She had given us shots. She gave shots to all of us. Pop, and me,
and John...me and John, yah. Then
Tape 80 Page 24
Speaker: ...then, I don't know. Some nurse was there and she said, Is Helen <gap> any
relation to you, she said? An Indian lady, you know? And I said, Yeah. She says, Yeah, I
know she's a Bird. Is she any relation to you? And I says, Well, yes. That's their Daddy's
sister. So then, the boy's Daddy's sister, I said. So she went and she called her before I
knew it Helen was there before I knew it. Ole John Bird was there. The old man? He was
there. So then, it was really a big blow. But not once...it didn't tell him to call the father...I
didn't tell him anything. They did it. They went and called Bertha in Utah, they called, they
called everybody. When I went.. I was out because they had given me a shot. And they
gave that shot to the two boys too, so they were kinna calm. We went to Aunt Libby's
afterwards. But, boy, I'm telling you, that was a real, real low blow.
