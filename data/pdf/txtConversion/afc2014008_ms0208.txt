Smithsonian American Folklife Festival
 
FROM:
 Legacy Books, Hatboro, Pa.
 
Book Cun.ultants to the Festival
 
SUBJECT: Suggested Books for Exhibit and Sale at the
 
1976 Festival.
 (List attached)
 
Attached is a list of books recommended for display and sale at
 
the forthcoming Festival of American Folklife.
 In assembling this
 
large number of titles, it was understood that the books would be
 
displayed and distributed during each working day June 16—Sept. 5.
 
It was further understood that the books would be displayed at
 
five separate locations, in proximity to the five separate features
 
and activities occurrin g each day of the Festival.
 
The preparation of this list was authorized and promptest by a
 
telephone conversation with Betty Beuck"n Friday, May 7, 1976.
 
It was understood that the list would contain books actually
 
available for sale, suitable to the Festival activities and
 
attractive to its audience.
 
The list is intended to serve as a basic list in support of the
 
educational function and impact of the 1976 Folklife Festival.
 
Although sparse in a few areas due to a) minimized preparation
 
time and b) paucity of pertinent material available in some
 
areas,_it is in itself extensive, featuring both variety and death.
 
Aside from illustrating the vitality and diversity of the subject,
 
it has another virtue: by including such a wide range of materials,
 
the impression is avoided of tacit approval and/or recommendation
 
_
_of the Smithsonian or the U.S. Government.
 Such an extensive list
 
insures that the public will find something  of interest, no matter
 
how this interest may vary from the special topic being highlighted
 
in that week!s activity.  Experience teaches that the public will
 
examine with curiosity, qnd admire many of the theme—oriented titles
 
of serious impact, but will prefer to buy and own something more.
 
pertinent to their own interests. For those who attend because of
 
their involvement with the highlighted topic, there will also be a
 
selection.
 
This list
 
contains nearly 600 titles which fall into about.50
 
diverse subject classifications.  (Classification and coding scheme
 
enclosed). All are relevant to the Festival program and are
 
compatible with the Festival's mission to interpret the broad
 
mosaic of folklife, creative activities, cultural heritage, and
 
(ethnic) community life, to an audience of spectators. As the Festival
 
will reflect surprisingly diverse and unfamiliar talents and activities,
 
SUGGESTED BOORS k F
!;STIVAL  continued
 
&
2—
 
the book selection offerings will support and augment these
 
topical progra
.nisy with something for the armchair enthusiast,
 
the student, the casual visitor, the knowled-able participant,
 
and help them discover the breadth, richness and diversity of
 
literature supportive of folklife activities.
 
Unlike selective bibliographies and book displays arranged to
 
guide students in organized studies and demonstrations of specifi c
 
cultural activities, which are necessarily limited, this list
 
reflects the broader interests of those who will attend the
 
Festival.
 It recognizes the public's desire to have available
 
for purchase not only standard,  orthodox studies, but also
 
inexpensive topical themes and treatments, gathered from around
 
the world and pulled out of regional obscutity.
 
BOOK EXHIBIT/SALES BOOTH FUNCTION
 
The contribution of a book exhibit/sales booth at a cultural
 
(folklife) festival is not limited only to a literature survey
 
of the subjects being featured in specific programs.
 It also
 
affords, for an undirected audience, the experience of casual
 
leafing through publications which explore the multi—fatted
 
subject of Folklore, a subject that embraces all human activity:
 
common and artistic, sophisticated and mundane, ancient and
 
contemporary, adult and juvenile.
 It is a certainty that most people
 
have never had the opportunity to browse and shop in a specialized
 
Folklore Bookshop before.
 The book(s) purchased will widen, and
 
make more pergianent, the educational significance and impact of
 
theprotean 1976 Folklife Festival ,  The creative impulse stimulated
 
momentarily by the Festival will thus be sustained by the books
 
carried home.
 
In sum, this is a working and viable.assemblege reflecting many
 
levels of experience, abilities, and varieties of interests. The
 
collection will offer the opportunity to explore the variations of
 
interest stimulated by the Festival, and hopefully nurture further
 
activity after they've gone home, where they will be reminded of
 
the artisan working at his craft,  or the performer recreating the
 
songs and stories, both past and contemporary.
 
CRITERIA FOR BOOK SELECTION
 
1. Suitability to the subject of folklore/folklife/f olkmusic/activity.
 
2. Appropriateness for the Festival and its Programs.
 
3.Availability: Only in—print books either on—hand, or readily
 
obtainable are included.
 (Some are out of print, and we have indicated
 
( 3 only, OP)) They represent the best quality available on the topic.
 
(The lateness in authorizing the book display precludes dealing with
 
suppliers who require 6-12 weeks to ship, such as overseas suppliers)
 
4. Overall quality.  All titles and editions are known to Legacy
 
Books.  We have excluded cheap quick—profit junk, and those which
 
exploit the fad market.  We have also not included overpriced
 
library—bound editions that have no eye appeal.

 OOXS * R FESTIVAL continued

-
5. Appeal to General Reading ;
Audience. Books unattractive in
 
format, too ephemeral, or unacceptably ponderous for the general
 
reader were passed over.
 
6. SALEABILITY: Books and authors which have proved acceptable to a broad
 
audience by continued interest and sales were weighted favorably.
 
APPLICATION OF LIST AND RECWMMEI
�
;DATIONS FOR DISPL1Y
 
Five active sales tables located in conjunction with the five areas
 
of concentration will be open and working each day of the Festival.
 
Each table should have, at any one time, at least 100 books (
5 copies
 
each of 20 titles,  or any other combination).
 Thus, there should
 
be about 500 books to open the Festival each day,  in any combination
 
of quantities.
 
As e
fich table will be physically located in separate areas, it is
 
recommended that many quick—suppl  titles be duplicated at several
 
or all tables.
 Three—fifths (
3
M of each table should be devoted
, to
 
the popular ti tles of general interest, and two—fifths (2/5) to
 
topics of special interest to the program, if available.
 
Anticipated sales for the combined five tables should readily maintain
 
a minimum of x200 gross each day, from our experience. For each five—
 
day sales period approximately 250 books should be sold, and should
 
be replaced, many with the following week's special topics.  Where
 
should be a back—up of about 500 books on hand to support depletion
 
of stock.
 
If a particular title is selling in great quantity, please call as
 
soon as possible so we can act on it immediately.  We will try to
 
give the quickest service when possible, but we don't warehouse
 
great quantities here.
 
Thus, a flexible formula should be:
 
500 books, in any quantity combinations, should be available for
 
display at the five areas at any given time.
 
500 books in reserve supply, to replenish depleted stock as needed.
 
At least 5
0% of stock at each table should be provided for general
 
audiences.  Many categories will overlap with general interest titles.
 
Periodic inventory reports on stock and re—supply requests issued,
 
perhaps once a week during the t
vfo—day hiatus, but immediately if
 
a title is selling out quickly and is popular.
 
As we become aware of further pertinent titles on subjects being
 
featured in the later weeks, we will submit further suggestions.
 
If the program directors can suggest books for their unit, we will
 
make every effort to get them... hopefully on time.
 
Note on the lists:
 * indicates easily obtainable, -
.nd we won't mind
 
accepting whatever returns must be made;
 means an IMPORT, and not
 
quickly replaceable;
 Not marked means order with hopes of not too
 
many returns (5-10 at a time).  V  In Didia
.n category is equivalent to
 
* in other categories, but please don't load up.  They don't sell
 
very quickly if we have to absorb all returns.

EVERY—DAY BOOKS
 
Generally inexpensive editions of fine anthologies, sought after
 
subjects, old favorites and of broad interest to a widely diverse
 
audience. The formats are attractive, the price is reasonable, and
 
they are generally easily replenished.  Some are the best on the
 
particular subject.  You may find that other titles we've included
 
in the specialized Program categories may fit in here, and some of
 
these may be pertinent to the Program subjects. It's all flexible,
 
but we've found these to be of particular interest at many Festivals.

FOLK MISCELLANEA
 
These were created as guides in general areas where we have
 
found particular interests among people who buy folklore
 
books. Many of the listings are sparse or unfilled only because
 
we've listed the titles under other more pertinent categories
 
to your program (country, U.S. area, occupation, "best—seller"
 
suggestions, etc)
 Sometimes it's difficult to determine exactly
 
where to list a specific book, but you can use these categories
 
as general guides and take it from there.

AMERICAN INDIAN
 
Most books on the American Indian fall into several categories:
 
a. ch1dren's re—told tales often phonied—up by the writer;
 
b. large, expensive pictorial coffee—table jobs;
 
c. Academic, ethnological tomes with technical language and footnotes
 
We've tried to steer a middle course in listing some of the more
 
popularly written books that have some genuine feeling.
 
Frankly, this is our weakest subject: it's very specialized, and
 
we often don't know which tribes lived where, and don't have time to
 
do the research.  Anything the program director knows about and can
 
suggest, we'll try to find and provide, if practical.

There's a wide variety of books we haven't mentioned, mostly
 
because of the lack of time to do some looking.  This list
 
scratches the surface, and can easily be enlarged, with the
 
criteria in mind of availability, price, and physical appear—
 
ance. There are hundreds of TITLES in these categories that are
 
so dull—looking and high priced they wouldn't attract a flea, and
 
they have been deliberately avoided. The Mid—South Folk Crafts
 
people sent us a list of titles they wanted us to supply for them
 
to sell. 9/10ths of them were returned unsold because nobody even
 
looked at them.  They now allow us to choose for them, and very few
 
don't sell.

OCCUPATIONS  
There is probably much more in each category than we've listed
 
here.  We've never classified books according to occupational
 
category, and in this short time it's difficult to come up with
 
an adequate selection, but we'll work on it further.
 
Many of the titles listed in "material Culture"  (XD) and some of
 
the "Regional America
." material  (Lumbering Songs,  agric ultural
 
themes,  etc) are also applicable here.
 Z
le also expect to get
 
some quantities of various Union (educational) pamphlets; maybe
 
the ILGI M, the �
leatcutters have a booklet of cartoons, jokes,
 
informational data on meat; the Railway Brotherhood has a pictorial
 
history of.trains, etc.

it has folklore.
