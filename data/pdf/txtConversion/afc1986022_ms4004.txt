afraid of his parents and he had hardly any schooling so he got a job into a rich family
and he was a driver and uh the conflict of the story was that uh he killed the white girl in
the family and he had to get rid of her (ques.) because uh she he brought her up to her
room because she was drunk one night after he had drove her around and after he had
got her on the bed the mother walked in and she was blind and he got scared he thought
because he was Negro they would say that he was doing something to her so right away
he covered a pillow over her so she wouldn't scream and he didn't mean to kill her but uh
smothered her and so uh after that when the mother left because she she couldn't tell who
was there he brought her down to the cellar and he put her in the furnace and he burned
her and he cut his head her head off and he thought he was going to get away with it and
uh he went to his grilfriend's house and he told that she he had to help she had to help him

to say that uh it was a Jewish friend of hers that had killed her and he was going to write a

went she wasn't really dead but he thought she was and he found out he had thrown all
the money down with her so he ran away and later on they found him and told him that she
wasn't dead and uh that she tried to climb out of the vat and she froze to death but she
would have lived otherwise and he has to go through all the trials and they try to help him

hardly any room for them to live and he always thought that it was all right and everything
and he always told them to stop bothering her and get off his back (ques.) well don't I
guess he figured that's how he should have tried out and told the truth but he figured he
didn't have a chance but I think that they wouldn't somehow they would've got him out of
it maybe uh just in life imprisonment would be better than the electric chair but he still said
that he didn't do anything you know and they brought him over the remains of the body
and everything and he still wouldn't he had to get convicted (ques.) well because he was
a uh Negro and at the first time when they seen the bones of this body why they thought
that he was trying to rape her and everything so that they tried and started to make up a
big story about it and none none of it was true but he didn't want to tell anyone he didn't
tell anyone of it (ques.) well they said that he probably tried to rape her and everything and
that he didn't know how to get rid of her body because he was afraid that when they found
out they would uh send him to the electric chair so then he threw her
4
in the furnace and then he thought he could make money off of it so he uh sent the letter
and everything and he was really no good and they thought he was such a nice boy and
(ques.) well'he was going to send the ransom note and he was going to tell them that it it
he signed it with the Jewish sign on the bottom and he said that it was the boy she was
out with the night before so he made it look like the boy killed her and then he was going
to say that you know it was them because they said they were communists and he said
he put the communist sign and he said that uh they it was them that sent the letter and
all and he said he told a big lie he told how when he came home he said the boy was
with her and the boy went upstairs with her and they told him to go and they left the car
out because they would make it look like it was him so they thought it was him and they
