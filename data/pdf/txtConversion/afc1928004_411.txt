SLAVERY BEFORE THE WAR. 
Written by WILLIAM HARRIS, and sung by HARRIS and CAnttou.. 
OH, don't take her from me and leave me alone, 
For dreary this poor old man's home it will be; 
I'll have no one to cheer me as old age creeps on, 
Oh, pity us, massa, and take me along. 
You'll take her away where I'll ne'er see her more; 
Perhaps she may die among strangers alone, 
With no one to cheer her deserted she'll be, 
Oh, pity us, massa, and leave her with me. 
CHORUS. 
God bless you, kind sir, for this good deed, 
You'll find that we'll try to do all that you need; 
In heaven above you'll find your reward, 
For not separating these two loving hearts. 
Oh, let him go with we, I 
beg of you do; 
We'll work for you daily, and pray for you too; 
We'll try to repay you as well as we can, 
Oh, don't 0,parate me from this poor old man. 
Just think of your mother in days long gone by; 
How she would have suffered if she had to die 
Away from your father without any home, 
Oh, pity us, massa, and take him along. 
God bless you, kind sir, eta.

Where dwells my darling -

NJw I 
wonder how she's looking 
At di; yere stage oh life ? 
I 
hardly think she'll know me now 
My black hair am turned gray ; 
I've not forgot my lubly wife 
Though I'm so long away ; 
I 
recollect when I 
was young, 
And we worked side by side— 
'Twas ' way down 'mong de sugar canes— 
I 
took her for my bride. 
Now we've both grown old together, 
My dear ol:3 wife an' I,

Dere's de 
place where I've passed so many happy hours wid 'Melia 
and de piceainnies ; but dat yere's a 
tender subject. As I 
passed round by de old churchyard (Music—" Massa's in 
de Cold, Cold Ground") I 
saw an increase in de graves dar. 
I 'spect de children am all laid dar to rest—bless tar souls ! 
But dar's one thing sure— Melia am not Jar, for I 
just 
heard her voice. I 
won't mention nuffin 'bout de children, 
for I 
know ' twill break her poor ole heart to tell de news. 
(Music ceases) I 
hope 'Melia won't blame de ole man for 
leaving her so sudden. 
ill go to her full of peniteneo, 
an' I 
know she'll take me home to her heart. 
Oh, 'Melia knows tat I 
was forced 
One day to say ' Good-bye ;"

OLD POMPEY THE FIDDLER. 
Sung by H ARRIS and CARROLL. 
HE. — Old Pompey the Fiddler play'd a 
rare tune, 
And a 
merry old darkey was he; 
His rosin was good—his stout bow of the best, 
And his break-down was something to see. 
He'd always a 
grin and a 
hearty laugh 
Whenever his door you would pass; 
His fiddle was always tuned up for the dance, 
And ready for each lad and lass. 
CHORUS—BOTH. 
There was Sam and Bill, Dinah and Nell! 
They merrily sang all day ; 
And cheerfully we would join the spree, 
For that was this darkey's way. 
SHE.—Old Pompey was handsome. He never would IN ed, 
Yet the wenches he loved passing well; 
And the reason he gave was of all the dear sex 
Which he liked best he never could tell. 
The Pollys, the Sallys, the Susans, and Fans 
So bothered old Pompey's soft heart, 
A 
bachelor free he resolved to be, 
And never from his fiddle part. 
BOTH.—There was Sam and Bill, etc. 
HE.—Old Pompey jogg'd on in his usual way, 
And play'd for the folks round about, 
Till, meeting one day a 
sweet colored girl gay, 
The sweet damsel upon him did pout. 
SHE. — Her bonnie black eyes took him so by surprise 
He asked her if she'd be his wife. 
She, grinning, said " Yes," and he gave her a 
kia, 
Arid now she's the plague of his life. 
SPOKEN.—Yes ; 
and we all danced at old Pomp's wed-
ding. 
CHORUS—BOTH. 
There was Sam and Bill, Dinah and Will! 
They merrily danced all day ; 
And cheerfully we did join in the spree, 
For that was this darkey's way.

POMPEY.—Just come down to see the apple of my eye, that 
dear, sweet, bewitching little yellow gal, Lisa Jane! 
Talk 
about your Venuses and such trash! 
You ought to see her. 
Why, she's so sweet, that she can't go out in the fields with-
out a 
veil, for fear of the bees lighting on her, she looks so 
much like a 
walking rose. 
Then she says I'm her darling. 
Hi ! I 
feel like a 
sunfish just caught. I 
can't keep still. 
I 
think I 
must be in love. 
That's her cottage, where she lives 
with her ma and pa. I 
wonder if she's home. Oh, my! how 
I 
would like to see her; yet my heart beats as if I

AIR—" Old Kentucky Home." 
The sun shines bright in my old Kentucky home, 
'Tis summer, the darkies are gay; 
The corn-top 's 
ripe, and the meadows are in bloom, 
And the birds make sweet music all the day. 
The young folks roll on the little cabin floor, 
All merry, all happy and bright; 
Bimeby hard times comes a-knocking at the door, 
Then my old Kentucky home " good night I"

LISA JANE, at the end of the 
1st verse, backs out of the cottage.

without being atscovered by LISA JANE until the end.] 
CHORUS. 
Weep no more, my lady, weep no more to-day, 
For we'll sing one song for my old Kentucky home 
For my old Kentucky home far away.

LISA JANE.—All well, and lively as crickets.

ask the old couple if they'll have me for a

POMPEY.—Tell me, now, you don't like any other fellow, do 
you? 
Lisa JANE.—Oh, go 'long!

LISA JANE

At second strain, played very loudly, a 
burlesque around

DARICEY'S HOLIDAY. 
Sung by HARRIS and CARROLL. 
HE. 
I LOVE the Southern clime, where this darkey was born, 
I 
love the dear vld time, each was a 
happy morn; 
With joy we worked all day, at eve we joined the dance ; 
Each dusky belle, so beautiful, could kill me with a 
glance. 
I 
tuned my old banjo, and struck the tambourine ; 
We sung the old time music as we capered round the 
green. 
The good massa would join, our fun would never rest ; 
Those days will never be forgot, within this darkey's 
breast. 
CHORUS. —BOTH. 
Dancing on the green, dancing on the green ; 
Joyful .darkeys we, when dancing on the green. 
Strike the old banjo, strike the tambourine ; 
That's the fun I 
loved, dancing on the green. 
SHE. 
They say this nigger's free; yes, free to want and pain, 
I 
would much rather see those good old times again, 
When through the cotton field I 
wandered with old Joe; 
But those good times will ne'er come back, those days of 
long ago. 
It makes my old man smile, he thinks of those sweet 
hours, 
When me with love tales he'd beguile, amidst those sunny 
bowers; 
But cheer up, dear old man, through life we've done our 
best, 
We'll pass out like the sunlight, when it dies in the west. 
CHORUS. —BOTH. 
Dancing on the green, dancing on the green; 
Joyful darkeys we, when dancing on the green. 
Strike the old banjo, strike the tambourine; 
That's the fun we loved, dancing on the green.

DAR'S NO PLACE LIKE DE OLD HOME. 
Sung by Wx. HAnnrs, of HAnnis and CARROLL. 
FAR away down South, among de cotton fields, 
Is de place dat I 
ever long to see ; 
Oh, dat dear sunny clime whar I 
was bred and born, 
Its mem'ries are ever dear to me. 
Dar de mocking-bird sings on de trees close by, 
While far from dat spot I 
roam. 
In dis wide, wide world, wherever I 
may go, 
Dar's no place like dat cabin home. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, gib me dat home on de old Pee Dee, 
For, darkeys, I 
love it still. 
I 
dream night and day, and long to see again 
Dat ole cabin home upon de hill. 
Oh, where are the friends who lingered at my sick 
In the happy times of long ago ? 
No smiles do I 
see or hear their merry voices. 
My heart is sad where'er I 
go ; 
When I 
think of the past then the tears will flow, 
For I 
love that old place still. 
Oh, take me home to that sunny land— 
To the old cabin home on the hill. 
0, gib me, etc. 
Oh, the ones that I 
love are sleeping 'neath the sod, 
While I 
am passing fast away, 
And my heart grows sad ; I'm longing to return 
Whar de ole man ever ought to stay, 
For de magnolias bloom round de old cabin door, 
Oh, den I 
turn wid a 
sigh ; 
I'll trabble back again—back to dat cotton Land; 
In dat old cabin home let me die. 
Oh, gib me, I

MABEL LEATHER-LIP. 
B 
NJO SOLO. 
Written and sung by WILLuat CAnnott, of HIATUS arui CAmaolz. 
Mr song is of a 
nice young girl, 
And her father's name was Pete; 
.She was as docile as a 
big baboon, 
And had onions on her feet. 
Her age was only sweet sixteen, 
And her middle name was Mabel, 
With a 
moire-antique nose and a 
leather upper lip, 
And an ear like a 
billiard table. 
CHORUS. 
Tral la le, tral lal lay, 
You should hear her say, 
I'll strike you with a 
ham— 
For my name it is Mabel, 
And I 
think I 
am able— 
That's the kind of a 
girl I 
am. 
She was head cook in a 
barber shop, 
Where she learned to be a 
glazier, 
And got.three dollars every week 
For cutting out corns with a 
razor. 
One day her lover, with his ear chewed off, 
Into the shop did rush; 
He cut her ear froth throat to throat, 
And shot her with the shaving brush. 
Tral la le, etc. 
The very next day she swore vengeance 
Upon her knees, before she rose, 
That she would have his useless life, 
By stuffing hot potatoes up his nose. 
She went and got a 
big cheese knife, 
From a 
neighbor who lived close by; 
She cut all the buttons off his overalls, 
And shouted, " Traitor, you must die r! 
Tral In le, etc.

Jua.—That makes a 
feller's eyes water.

Uncle Bill was here. 
He used to love to be with the boys. 
JOE. 
Uncle Bill ? 
Why, he must be done gone long ago.

PETE.—Then he was so good-natured. 
JOE.— What tricks we used to play on the old man. 
JAKE. —Yes ; 
do you remember when we filled an old hat 
with bricks, and turned it upside down on the ground before 
Uncle Billy's door ? 
He made a

Can it be possible that these old ears of mine 
have deceived me? I've been away from home just five years 
this very Christmas eve. 
Ah, that's a 
long time to wander up 
and down the world. 
Maybe the folks are all dead. 
Shouldn't 
wonder. Most time for the old max to turn up his toes to the

I 
suppose I'm forgotten.

Ah, they

And when I

And we say so, and we hope so. 
Cos I 
couldn't learn they said I

Oh I 
poor old man! 
My skin was white, and I 
was fair before they took to teaching me; 
I 
always cried, and never tried to learn my alphabet ; 
I 
used to drink the ink, I 
think, as they were always beating me, 
' 
l'was through my skin the ink worked in, and made me black as 
jet. 
Oh I 
b'lieve me, drre. 
I 
had many sweethearts when I 
was young and strong. 
And we say so, and we hope so. 
But now all the girls laugh and say go along. 
Oh! poor old man 
I 
once did love a 
pretty girl, and promised I 
would marry her, 
I 
bought the ring, and everything was ready for the day; 
And when the day arrived I 
called, and hope to church I'd carry 
her, 
She'd slop'd, elop'd, gone, done, and run with another man awtty. 
Oh! b'lieve me, &c. 
If I 
had the cash I 
would treat you all round. 
And we say so, and we hope so.

tell you what my little brother Jimmy did,

He put it in a

'Twas very rash, the bank went smash, and settled my poor hash. 
Oh I 
b'lieve me, &c. 
My story is done, so now I'll go away. 
And we say so, and we hope so. 
For nobody here seems to mind what I 
say. 
Oh! poor old man I

TRAVELLING BACK AGAIN. 
Written for BILLY HARRI$, Of ITAnnts and CARROLL, by W ILLIE PDX, 
Character Vocaliat. 
Word and Atueic Original by 1.1"Annis and CARROLL. 
I 
IIAYE travelled far and near from the place that I 
love 
dear, 
Yet, to-day, while walking leisurely along, 
I 
was thinking of my home I 
left not long ago. 
That's why I 
sing for you my little song. 
It was down in old Kentucky I 
left when twenty-two, 
And, kind friends, the -Darting gave me pain ; 
But I'll yet see my old wile—my children so young in life. 
That is why I 
am trying to travel back again. 
CHORUS. 
I'll be welcomed with a 
smile as they gave me when but 
a 
child. 
I 
can see the place far o'er the rolling plain; 
Yes, these voices will be clear when sounding on my ear. 
That's why, kind friends, I 
am travelling back again. 
What is that spot I 
8ce, ? It fills my heart with glee. 
It's the old church which I 
used to love so dear, • 
Where my little child would say, " Oh, papa, come and 
pray."' 
I 
tell you them's the days which gave me cheer. 
The little school-house too, the woods I've wandered 
through, 
My co ft:we that was painted neat and clean, 
That faithful old dog " Touse," which always was round 
my house ; 
I 
will 8ce them when I 
travel back again. 
I'll be welcomed, etc. 
I 
know soon I 
must die, yet it makes me almost cry, 
When I 
have to leave the people which I 
love; 
But we all must go some day—that's what the prophets 
say. 
If not here, I 
hope to meet all friends above. 
I 
fought for " Uncle Sam," to free my native land ; 
General Washington, he said the day I've'd gain ; 
But now the fighting's o'er, and I 
hope we'll have no 
More, 
Because I 
am trying to travel back acrain

I'll be welcomed, ay.

THE TIME WHEN WE WERE YOUNG. 
Written by HARRY BENNETT. 
Sung by Hennrs and CARROLL. 
DAR'S a 
pretty little spot down in Southern Tennessee, 
Whar de ivy blossoms twine around de door. 
And ever fresh and green in our memories it will be, 
Though we know we'll never see it any more. 
But we never can forget the old home we loved so well, 
And the many good old tunes that we have sung ; 
And the tears they fill our eyes every time we try to tell 
Of the times we used to have when we were young. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, de tarabo and de bones are forever laid away, 
And de fiddle and de banjo am unstrung; 
But we often heave a 
sigh for de happy days gone by, 
And de times we used to have when we were young, 
When de autumn days had come we would husk de yaller 
corn; 
In de fields we were a-singing all de day, 
For before dey made us free we had never cause to mourn, 
And around the old place everything was gay. 
And many, many times, when do work of day was o'er, 
With our melody de old plantation rung ; 
And our hearts do often long for the happy days of yore, 
And times we used to have when we were young. 
Oh, de tambo, etc.

THE DREAM. 
Written by F. McAvor. 
Norah Criena." 
DID you ever have a 
dream ? 
I 
tell you it's a 
nice sensation, 
That is if you dream about your friends 
Or any of your rich relations. 
I 
had.a dream the other night 
That filled my heart with joy and pleasure. 
I'll tell you what I 
dreamed about, 
As I 
happen to have the time and leisure. 
Aire.—" Teddy 31eGlyn." 
I 
dreamed I 
was home, with my onld friends around Pie, 
At home in sweet Erin, the land of my birth, 
And my brothers and sisters were all glad to see me, 
And the turf fire was burning so bright on the hearth, 
And my mother, God bless her, she cried with delight, 
sure ; 
And my father cried, " Welcome, my darling asthore," 
And my grandmother, too, though near blind with old 
age, sure, 
She kissed me a 
welcome to Erin once more. 
Am.—" Queer Sights." 
Then, after the greetings were over, 
There came a 
slight rap at the door, 
And before you could whistle Ould Casey 
The piper stepped in on the floor. 
With a 
grasp of the hand and a " bless you," 
And a 
tear in the old piper's eye, 
He welcomed me back home to Grauia, 
And called me his broth of a 
boy. 
Ant.—" Widow McGee." 
Then the boys and the girls they began to drop in, 
For a 
shake of the hand, with a 
welcome thrown in, 
And old Mrs. Murphy remarked, with a 
grin, 
That a 
drop of the erathur would be no great sin. 
Then the boys and the girls all cried out for a 
dance, 
And even the children began for to prance, 
And Casey he to.ok out his pipes for a 
tune, 
And he gave us " The Cow that Jumped Over the Moon."

I WANT TO SEE THE OLD HOME. 
Words by PRANR DUMONT. 
Music by JAMES E. 
STEWART. 
The Music of this song is published by J. L. PETERS, 699 Broadway, New 
York. 
Price 30 cents. 
I'VE wandered very far away 
From the clime where I 
was born, 
And my poor heart has been so sad, 
Dejected and forlorn; 
No master kind to treat me well; 
To cheer me when in pain; 
I 
want to see the cotton flelds 
And the dear old home %gain. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the good old days Pre pass'd and gone, 
I 
sigh for them in vain ; 
I 
want to see the cotton fields 
And the dear old honAca again. 
I'm left all sad and lonely now, 
When my days are verr few, 
My wife and children both Are gone, 
I 
don't know what to do; 
Old master too, he may be de.a.i, 
His hair was turning gray; 
Oh, let me see that good old honao 
Before I 
pass away. 
Oh, the good old days, eta. 
When I 
was free I 
left that land 
Where the days are bright and fair, 
Where missus spoke to me so kind, 
When I 
was bowed with care; 
I 
left that home no friends to find, 
My heart was fill'd with pain; 
Oh, take me to that good old home, 
To see it once again. 
Oh, the good old days, etc. 
MY OLD KENTUCKY HOME, 
Good_night 
[Copyright, 1876, by ROBERT M. 
nEwrrr.) 
A SKETCH FOR TWO CHARACTERS. 
[Scene. a 
wood. 
Enter PETE, an old daKkey, with a 
stick and 
bundle over his shoulder. 
The music plays the first strains 
of "Old Kentucky Home.] 
PETE. — ICS a 
long, long road I've trabbled; and I 
don't 
seem to get any nearer to my journey's end. 
I've been north, 
and east, and west; but I 
nebber ctuld content myself. 
Dar's 
no place like de old plantation. 
How many happy days I've 
spent dar! Dar's where my old woman libed long years ago. 
Dar's where my children used to play 'round me, and where 
Massa and Misses used to be. 
Oh, de dear old home! I 
wonder if dar's anyone liviu' dar yet. 
No better home on de 
face of de earth. 
I've been gone many a 
year, but I've found 
' 
no home. 
I'm trabbling on to rest dese old bones, under de 
shade of de trees, where I 
used to play when I 
was a 
boy. 
[Going.] 
[Enter MAssA CHARLES.] 
CHARLES.—Well, as I 
live, if that isn't old Uncle Pete! H6 
won't know me, of course. 
PETE. —I 
heard a 
voice somewhere, sure. 
CHARLES.— Don't you know me, Uncle Pete ? 
PETE. —No! No! I 
doesn't remember any body in these 
parts. 
I've been gone so long. 
CHARLES.—Why don't you know young Massa Charles, 
that you used to dance on your knee. 
PETE.—You Massa Charles? Well! well! Why I 
shouldn't 
have known you if I 
hadn't seen you! 
CHARLES.—[ Adieu.] I 
see the old man is a 
little confused 
in the upper story. 
PETE.— Well ! well! Don't know your face; but I 
suppose 
you's Massa Charles. 
How's de old folks? 
CHARLES. —All well, and flourishing; but the old home is 
ours no more. 
Do you remember the old home, Uncle Pete ? 
PETE.— Do I 
remember it? Ah, yes! 
CHARLES. —Do you remember thht old song you used to sing 
about it? 
PETE. - 
Do I remember it? Oh, how many a time I've 
sung it, as I've jigged along on de road, just to keep up die 
old heart! 
CHARLES. — Sing it now, Uncle Pete, and it will gladden 
my heart to hear it. 
PETE.—Let me see, how was de tune.

On the meadow, the hill, and the shore,

On the bench by the old cabin door.

GOOD OLD SOUTHERN HOME. 
Sung by AL. PAoE. 
Not many years ago, 
When I 
use to rake and hoe 
On the Louisiana bottom, all the day ; 
But since I've been set free, 
Not much pleasure do I 
see ; 
But at last those gool old days have passed away. 
But I 
am getting old and gray, 
And I 
soon must pass away. 
My good old mosso beckons me to come. 
If you hear those voices ringing 
I'm waiting for you now, so I 
must go leave my good old 
southern home. 
CHORUS. 
All my friends have gone up there, 
With the angels bright and fair ; 
My good old massa beckons me to come 
From the heaven bright and fair, 
With angels dwelling there, 
I 
must go and leave my god old southern 
When I 
was but a 
little boy, 
To dance and sing it was my joy; 
You could always find me gamboling on the e
l ,sen, 
But I'm getting old and gray, 
And I 
soon must pass away, 
And say farewell to the happy days I've seen , 
But I 
know I 
soon must go, 
For the Bible tells me so— 
I'm waiting for my summons now to come ; 
For de angels dwell up (-tar, and look so bright and fair, 
I 
must go and leave my good old southern home. 
All my friends, etc.

MY GAL. 
[Copyright, 1875, by RoBEET M. DEWITT.] 
A SKETCH FOR TWO CHARACTERS—DRESSED AMIE. 
[Scene, a 
street. 
Enter AUGUSTUS, who looks around as if 
expecting some one. 
He is dressed as a 
fop.] 
AUGUSTUS.—I wonder where she can be? 
She made an ap-
pointment to meet me here precisely at eight. 
It's past that 
now. I 
wonder if she will disappoint me? No; I 
don't be-
lieve she will, for I 
flatter myself I 
have won that palpitating 
little heart of hers. 
Oh, she's a 
beauty! 
Nobody else stands 
a 
show to win her from me. 
Why, she wouldn't look at 
another chap. 
I'm her only beau. 
Where can she be ? 
Girls 
are always late. 
Hello! I 
wonder who this is? 
He ooks 
enough like me to be my twin. 
[Enter ADOLPHUS.] 
ADOLFIMS.—She said she'd be here at eight. Y 
hope she's 
not going to disappoint. 
I 
never knew her to break her 
promise. 
Oh, she's just the sweetest little angel out of para-
dise! 
Such eyes! 
Such hair! 
And then she loves me so. 
She calls me pet and sugar-plum, and all sweet cognomens 
like these. 
Then the best of it is she won't even look at an 
other fellow. 
[Sees AUGUSTUS.] 
Hello! [Aside.] I 
wonder 
what he's dodging around here for. 
Why, lie's got into my 
clothes. 
I'll accost his royal highness. 
How do you do, 
stranger ? 
AUGUSTUS.—P111 lively, thank you. 
What's the news? 
ADOLPHUS. —Oh, nothing. 
You didn't happen to see a 
pretty little gal passing by here, did you? 
AUGUSTUS.—What sort of a 
gal? 
Tall, short, slim, stout, or 
otherwise? 
ADOLPHUS. —Well, I 
guess otherwise. 
AUGUSTUS.—NO. 
I 
was looking for a 
little gal myself. 
ADOLPHUS.—Yes; what kind of a 
looking gal is she? 
AUG UST US. — Oh, she's not very tall, dark eyes, lovely ring-
lets, dimpled chin, and pearly teeth. 
She was to meet me 
here at eight. 
ADOLPIIUS (
aside).—I 
begin to smell a 
mice. 
AUGUSTUS.—She never failed to keep her appointment 
\ 
41 
MY GAL.---LCoNTmEn.1 
before. I 
guess she'll come along soon. 
[Begins to draw on 
gloves.] 
ADOLPHUS (draws on gloves of the same color).—I 
guess 
she'll be here. 
What's your gal's name? 
AUGUSTUS.—Melinda Jane. 
AnoLmus.-0 heavens! tliat's my gal's name! 
AUGUSTUS. — Your gal's name? Do you mean to say you 
know my Melinda Jane? 
A 
DOLPH US. — Your Melinda Jane ? 
A 
UGUSTUS. —Yes ; my Melinda Jane I 
ADOLPHUS.—Why, I 
guess not; she's going to meet me 
here at eight. 
AUGUSTUS.—She promised to meet me, too 
ADOLPIIUS.—Oh, I 
guess not! 
AUGUSTUS.—Oh, I 
guess yes! 
ADOLPHUS.-011, no! 
AUGUSTUS.—Oh, yes! 
ADOLPHUS.—She says I'm her only beau. 
A 
UGUST US.—She says she'll expire for me. 
ADOLPHUS.—Oh, go '
way, child. 
AUG1TSTLTS.—Shrimp, depart! 
ADoLptitis.—She's my gal, anyhow. 
AUGUSTUS.—I 
say she's my gal. 
ADOLPHUS. —She's mine! 
AUGUSTUS.—She's mine

Now, white folks all, take my advice, 
And remember what I 
say, 
Get married all. as I 
have done, 
For I 
feel so good to-day; 
With my Chloe sitting by my side 
I'm happy as a 
king-, I 
know; 
I'll tap de tambo, we'll sing de chorus; 
And bid you all adieu. 
Cho. We'll dance, & c. 
THE OLD HOME AIN'T WHAT IT USED TO B. 
Oh, the old home ain't what it used to be, 
The banjo and the fiddle has gone, 
And no mere you hear the darkies singing, 
Among the sugar cane and corn ; 
Great changes has come to the poor colored man, 
But this change makes him sad and forlorn, 
For no more we hear the darkies singing 
Among the sugar cane and corn. 
CHORUS. 
No, the old home ain't what it used to be, 
The change makes me sad and forlorn, 
For no more we hear the darkies singing 
Among the sugar cane and corn. 
in the field I've worked when I 
thought ' twas hard, 
But night bro't its pleasure and rest, 
in the old house down by the river side. 
The place of all the world the best, 
Oh, where are the children that once used to play 
In the lane by the old cabin door, 
They are scattered now and o'er the world they roam, 
The old man ne'er will see them more. 
No, the old home, itc. 
Now the old man would rather lived and died 
in the home where his children were born, 
But when freedom came to the colored man, 
He left his cotton-field and corn. 
This old man has lived out his three-score and ten, 
And he'll soon have to lay down and die, 
Yet he hopes to go into a 
better land, 
So now, old cabin home, good-bye. 
No, the old home, Eko.

[Beer e, a ro4—plantation in the distance. 
Enter OLD 
BLACr JOE, as the music plays " Home, sweet home." He 
leans upon his staff, and listens.] 
OLD BLACK JOE.—Home, sweet home! 
Oh, how long I 
have sighed to see it once again. 
I've been a 
wanderer up 
and doRn the world for the last twelve years, and many a 
time have I 
dreamt of the old plantation and the old folks 
there. .End now, when I'm almost to my journey's end, I 
arrive in sight of the dear old place at last. 
I 
haven't got 
many more miles to go before I'll lay these poor old bones of 
mine down for the last time. 
How well I 
remember gooi old 
massa and rnissis. 
Den there was young Massa Charles, and 
den there wa,3 my wife Clohoe. 
De tears come rolling down 
my cheeks when I 
think of old times. 
But I 
must plod along 
to the old plank; tion. 
[Enter CHARLES.] 
CHARLES.—Why, as I 
live, it's Old Black Joe! 
OLD JOE.—Whe calls Old Black Joe ? I 
haven't heard that 
name in twelve long years. 
CHARLES.—Why, don't you know me, Joe? 
Don't you 
know your old Maak,sa Charles' son, whom you used to danco 
upon your knee ? 
OLD JOE.—What/ you Massa Charles' son—young Massa 
Charles ? 
Well, well. 
[They shake hands.] 
CHARLES.— Yes, Joe; and I'm glad to see you back. 
OLD JOE — But tell me. how is old massa, Massa Charles 7 
Is he well ?

Don't say

CHARLES.—It's too true, Joe. 
But cheer up! 
Welcome 
back home; you shall never leave us again. 
OLD JOE.—Can I 
stay on the old plantation, massa1 
CHARLES.—Yes, my dear old playmate. 
OLD JOE.—Thank ye, Massa Charles, thank ye! 
And se 
t 
they are all gone. 
Even my poor wife. 
I 
think I 
hear theif 
voices calling me; and I 
feel that I 
soon shall go. 
CHARLES.—Don't you recollect that good old song you used 
to sing once on a 
time, Joe? 
The one you called Old Black 
Joe ? 
OLD JoE.—Yes, yes; but I 
haven't had the heart to sing it 
these many days. 
CHARLES.—Do sing it for me now, that's a 
good fellow; rad 
go down to the foot of yonder tree, and listen as I 
used to 
do when I 
was a 
little boy. 
OLD JOE.—If it will please you, Massa Charles, I 
will. 
CHARLES.—Do. 
The sound of your voice, once again, 
bring back a 
thousand reminiscences of the days that are ptsst. 
Sing the old song, Joe. 
[Exit CHARLES.] 
OLD JOE.—Ab! once I 
was happy when I 
sung; out now 
Old Joe is pretty nigh broken down. 
[The music plays " Old Black Joe." OLD JOE sings the 1st 
verse. 
In the Chorus, the words " I'm coming," are echoed after 
JOE behind the scenes; the remainder of Chorus is sung by JOE, 
with the exception of the last line, which is sung very softly 
behind the scenes also. 
After the conclusion of the sang, 
CHARLES returns, and slowly leads OLD JOE off the stage. 
OLD JOE, overcome with emotion, leans upon his young massa.

tone, and missis too. 
Even my dog has left me. 
Well, well ; 
I'm only waiting for de summons to come along for poor old 
Pomp. Many and many a 
year I've trabbled on de road, and 
I'm footsore and weary now.

live, it's old Pomp! Pomp, don't you 
know me? 
POMP.—Yes—no. Why—why, it's Massa Henry!

see your old eyes are good for some, 
thing yet. 
POMP.—Well, well, war did ye come from ? 
HENRY. —Oh, I've been traveling up and down the world 
for the last seven or eight years. 
But how is everything on 
the old plantation ? 
POMP.—All gone to ruin. 
Everybody 'cept me gone dead. 
HENRY.—Cheer up, old friend. 
Why, you used to be as 
lively as a 
cricket. 
No song was as gay as yours on the old 
plantation. 
Where's the old banjo? 
PomP.—Hangs up on the wall; I 
haven't the heart to pick 
on de strings any more. 
•HEN1:Y.—Come, Uncle Pomp, sing as a 
song. 
Maybe 'twill 
rouse you up. 
Tell me something about the old home. 
POMP.—Well, well, Massa Henry, I 
can't sing like I 
used 
to, but I'll try.

and commences the step. 
At the conclusion of the song he is 
completely Cred out, and is assisted to the door of the cabin bg 
HENRY. 
The danee is played softly until the curtain falls.]

THE LITTLE OLD LOG C 
ABIN.—[C ()Nu LunE D.] 
Oh, I 
once was happy all the day, and never knew a 
care, 
And my good old wife she wandered by my side; 
Our little home was humble, but happiness was there,— 
'Twas the sweetest spot in all the world se wide. 
Now ' tis sinking to decay, and all is dark and sad, 
And I 
hear upon the roof the falling rain; 
E'en the banjo now is silent, that once made my heart so glad. 
In my little old log cabin in the lane. 
Cho.—Ah, yes, I'm old and feeble now, &T. 
So I'll totter to my journey's end, and try to do my beat, 
Though I'm sad and weary-hearted all the day; 
The angels soon will call me, I 
soon will be at rest 
In that bright and happy home so far away. 
Still I 
linger by the door, and try to sing my song 
As I 
used to do among the sugar cane; 
And I'm waiting for the summons, and it soon will come along, 
To my little old log cabin in the lane. 
ves, I'm old and feeble now, &c.
