The initial—and most difficult—problem faced by any folklorist 
studying agricultural practices is to make some judgment as to the 
relative traditionality of what he is examining. Some decisions are 
easy; there are no popular "how to" manuals studied by everyday farmers 
about working with horses, mules, or oxen, so methods of working animals 
can safely be determined traditional. Likewise, many implements used 
in horse-agriculture, such as homemade ground sleds, cultivators, and 
harrows, are clearly folk in origin and development. Conversely, 
many practices and developments are just as clearly not folk. The 
manufactured "bulk barn" in which bright leaf tobacco is cured, for ex¬ 
ample, is strictly a non-folk invention; there are no folk antecedents. 
Most tobacco farming practices, material objects, and even 
language fall somewhere between these clear extremes. This vast 
middle ground, with its complex interrelationships between folk and 
popular, presents the problem for the folklorist. A Vulcan No. 12 
plow, for example, though it certainly has folk antecedents, is a 
non-folk product; there are no regional variations in a Vulcan plow. 
The use of this plow, however, is more clearly traditional, learned 
by watching and doing. The distinction is the same as the one 
presented by Henry Glassie: 
A guitar manufactured in a Kalamazoo factory is not folk even 
when played by a bluesman from the Mississippi Delta, the object 
is not reinterpreted and then newly produced in the way that a 
song the same man might have learned from a popular source 
would be.l 
In the same manner as the folk musician plays traditional music on his 
non-folk guitar, the farmer uses his non-folk implement in traditionally 
learned ways.

The study of tobacco culture is particularly complex. Probably 
more scientific and technological research has gone into developing 
new insect and disease resistant strains of tobacco and improved methods 
of cultivation of the plant than has gone into any other crop. The 
economic and political importance of the crop has necessitated this 
early "agri-business" approach and a brief examination clearly 
illustrates why. 
Tobacco is the earliest cash crop grown in America.^ Tobacco alone 
provided the economic base necessary in order for the mid-Atlantic 
colonies to survive. One of the great seals of colonial Virginia, 
for example, illustrates the undisputed importance of this crop; it 
shows an Indian queen on bended knee offering a tobacco to Britannia, 
who in turn clasps the globe and septer. Although prior to the 
1610's American tobacco was less favored in Britain and Europe than 
that grown in Spain and Portugal, after the Virginian John Rolfe 
developed a strain that met with marketing success in 1612, exports 
from the colonies to the mother country dramatically increased. By 
1616, tobacco was the chief export commodity of Virginia, and by 1618, 
imports of tobacco into England from Virginia exceeded those of 
all other countries. Such rapidly increasing production caused 
periodic overstocked markets, low prices, and hard times for the planters, 
but the general trend of ever-increasing production prevailed. In 
1698, Virginia and Maryland exported about forty million pounds to 
England and Scotland. On the eve of the Revolution, Virginia alone 
exported fifty-five million pounds.^ Tobacco export from America into 
England was practically nil during the Revolution, but by 1784, the 
United States was once again the leading exporter of tobacco to Great 
Britain. In that year, over forty million pounds were exported to the 
British Isles.^ 
3 
Virtual dependence on such an important cash crop as tobacco 
naturally had long-lasting economic and social effects; by 1660, the 
cultivation of tobacco necessitated a large and inexpensive labor force— 
slaves. The general practice was to grow three or four crops on one 
parcel of land while new ground was being cleared for future cultivation. 
As production increased and farm sizes grew, and as the economic 
market fluctuated, the planter depended ever more on cheap labor as 
the solution to his need to expand. Whereas land was always avail¬ 
able and cheap, non-slave labor was not. By 1674, slave labor on 
tobacco famrs was the rule in Virginia's tidewater and eastern 
Piedmont sections. If a planter did not have the capitol to expand 
his acreage and employ slave labor, it was difficult for him to 
successfully compete, and he often folded. The trend, therefore, 
was toward agri-business and away from the small family farm. 
Large scale cultivation of tobacco naturally affected the look of 
the land. The cultural landscape of late colonial Virginia has been 
well-described by Joseph Robert: 
...a traveler could stand on a hill...look about him and see 
plantations every four or five miles, clusters of buildings 
in the distance giving the appearance of tiny villages. Each 
plantation had its dwelling house, kitchens, smoke house, tobacco 
houses, and scattered Negro cabins. There were the inevitable 
peach and apple orchards for the equally inevitable fruit brandy. 
Closer examination showed many of the 'mansion houses' to be 
unpainted frame structures, with wooden shutters and wooden clay- 
lined chimneys, and lacking both glass and plaster. Others, 
holding more closely to the genteel tradition, were painted, 
lathed and plastered within, and had window glass and neat brick 
chimneys. They were all in the timber district, and the mean¬ 
dering fields were divided by rail fences so zig-zag in design 
that the New Englanders developed a saying for a man in liquor: 
he was making Virginia fences. 
This scene continued to expand west into the Virginia piedmont and south 
and west into neighboring North Carolina, and, especially after the 
turn of the nineteenth century, into the "western countries" of Tennessee 
4 
and Kentucky. By 1840, Kentucky was second only to Virginia in tobacco 
production, and Tennessee ranked third, followed by North Carolina.^ 
Through the first half of the nineteenth century, virtually all 
tobacco was sun and air cured. This meant that when the crop was 
harvested, the plants were cut off near the ground and either (originally) 
stood upright with the leaves on the ground, or (later) hung from 
scaffolding built in the field. After several days, it was taken from 
the field into a well-ventilated barn and hung from "tier poles" to 
complete the curing process.^ It was noted by Waltham in 1800, however, 
that if the air was too humid for proper curing, a small fire would 
often be built under the tobacco on the earthen barn floor in order 
O 
to reduce the humidity. Especially as tobacco farming moved into the 
western territories, this practice of complementing air-curing with 
fire-curing increased. The mid-1830's saw a sudden, but short-lived, 
increase in the popularity among Europeans for the smoky flavored 
tobacco inherent in the fire-curing process, hence the new farms in 
the west used the process and cashed in while they could. In fact, 
although some continues to be grown in northwestern Virginia, it is 
the northwestern section of Tennessee and the southwestern section 
of Kentucky where most fire-cured tobacco is grown today. Fire¬ 
curing, of course, has its obvious dangers; besides the temperature 
and smoke levels being hard to control, there are many accounts of 
entire crops being burned along with their barns. Especially in 
Virginia and North Carolina, the rage for fire-cured tobacco had 
dwindled by the mid-1840's, and the practice of sun and air-curing 
resumed. 
5 
Flue-curing of tobacco, though experimented with in the 1820's, 
was not widely adopted until after the Civil War. In this process, 
a fire is built in a fire-box outside of the barn, and the smoke, 
gases, and heat travel through long flues just above the floor of the 
barn before being expelled outside. This method creates a dry, smokeless 
environment similar to that used in the kiln-drying of lumber. This 
flue-curing process is a good example of polygenesis, for in the 
1820's, at least five persons reported their "improved method" for 
curing tobacco—all apparently unaware of the work of the others.^ 
Flue-curing of tobacco did not gain wide acceptance until after 
the development of "bright" tobacco. This tobacco, which has a 
pronounced lemon-yellow color after it is cured, was first developed 
in the late 1830's, though it was not widely grown until after the 
War Between the States- It seems this yellow tobacco—which from the 
first brought fancy prices—was the result of being grown on thin, 
sandy soil, soil previously considered shamefully poor. From its 
first appearance in the Caswell County region of North Carolina, it 
soon spread to neighboring Pittsylvania County, Virginia. From this 
base, it rapidly ballooned after the war throughout the "Old Bright 
Belt" region of Virginia and North Carolina, and, as cotton prices 
declined, moved into the "New Bright Belt" region of eastern North 
Carolina in the 1880's. It eventually was introduced into South 
Carolina as well. To this day, it is flue-cured, bright leaf tobacco 
which is the heavily predominant tobacco grown in both Virginia and 
North Carolina. 
Along with the development of the bright-leaf strain and the use of 
flue-curing, the practice of "priming" the tobacco crop increased as 
well. This practice, used sporadically earlier, consists of pulling 
6 
the leaves from the plant as they ripen, rather than harvesting the 
entire plant at once. When this is done, the need for barn space 
is reduced, for each priming is cured as it is pulled, hence the barns 
are soon empty and ready for the next priming. 
The only type of tobacco other than bright leaf grown today in 
North Carolina and Virginia's Blue Ridge is hurley. This type 
was the unexpected result of a sudden deviation of another standard 
bright-type, a biological phenomenon known as a "sport.This variation 
was first noticed in 1864, in Brown County, Ohio, just across the river 
from Kentucky. In 1866, a couple of "hogsheads" (pronounced hog-sits^1) 
of this tobacco brought high prices in Cincinnati. It was very popular 
as a plug filler and because of its ability to absorb large quantities 
of sweetenings and flavorings. Throughout the 1870's and 1880's, 
hurley spread southeast across Kentucky and into Tennessee and, somewhat 
later, entered far western North Carolina. As bright leaf tobacco 
had done in Virginia and North Carolina, "white hurley," as it was 
originally termed, replaced the old-type dark tobaccos in popularity. 
Today, as in the past, most of North Carolina's burley is grown in 
the far western counties of Madison and Buncombe,1 although a small 
amount is currently grown as far northeast as Ashe and Allegheny 
Counties in the eastern Blue Ridge. According to local growers in this 
area, however, people did not begin growing hurley commercially in 
Alleghany County until the 1930's. Even less is grown in the southern 
Blue Ridge of Virginia, though much is grown further to the west, 
particularly in Washington and Scott Counties. 
Of course, many people in otherwise non-tobacco growing regions 
continue to grow small amounts of tobacco for their own use. Of these 
home growers, most seem to grow a special variety of tobacco best-suited 
7 
for chewing.13 These people also generally cure and twist their tobacco 
as well. 
The Blue Ridge region marks the line of demarcation between the 
flue-cured and hurley tobacco regions. Flue-cured begins at the base 
of the mountains and continues east, while hurley begins up the mountain 
and spreads west. The sizes of both hurley and flue-cured farms in 
this region are relatively small when compared with other tobacco- 
producing regions, such as Kentucky (hurley) and the North Carolina 
piedmont (flue-cured). Correspondingly, tobacco allotments on these 
farms are relatively small, often being, in the hurley areas, only a few 
hundred pounds, hence requiring only a portion of an acre for its 
production. 
Both hurley and flue-cured tobacco, however, have a high monetary 
return per acre and pound. For example, for the period 1953-1957, the 
national return per acre for hurley was $870.39 and for flue-cured 
$747.30. These two, except for the more exotic types (such as Florida, 
Wisconsin, and Connecticut cigar wrappers), bring the highest return 
per acre and pound of all the types.^ The reason for this fact is 
simple—the dramatic increase in the popularity of cigarettes since 
about 1920 and the corresponding drop in popularity of cigars, snuff, 
and chewing tobacco. Cigarettes use predominately bright tobaccos, 
while the other tobacco products mentioned use what is termed dark 
tobacco. Nonetheless, the monetary worth of both hurley and flue-cured 
tobacco, relative to both states' entire agricultural market, is very 
small.

The Blue Ridge Project's documentation of working flue-cured tobacco 
centers around the Slate/Moorefield agragation. This group consists 
of Beech Slate, in his late sixties and the universally acknowledged 
talker of the group; his sister-in-law, Sally Hall Slate; and her son, 
Tim, laid off during the time of our visit from the "rubber thread factory" 
near Stuart and a recent high school graduate. Benton Moorefield is 
a school bus driver and tobacco farmer in his mid-forties; his wife 
is Margie Slate Moorefield; and their daughter, Lisa, is a high school 
student and beauty contest winner. Their friends and neighbors, Hassel 
Handy (in his mid-fifties) and Bernie Dollarhite (in his seventies) 
help out. Everyone lives in the Claudeville section of Patrick County, 
Virginia. They all help one another with their tobacco, which makes 
the priming, stringing, housing, and packing of tobacco an almost 
continual job from late summer through early fall. 
Beech Slate of Claudeville, Patrick County, Virginia, grows about 
five acres (12,000 pounds) of flue-cured tobacco. He has raised tobacco 
since he was a child: 
The first work I ever done in tobaccer in my life was holding 
the stick. My daddy and older brother split that stalk, you 
know, and cut it off, dropped it over that stick. Fill that 
stick and lay it down in the field and let it wilt, then help 
haul it to the barn and house it. Well, the next thing, we 
went to spreading burlap sacks and breaking these leaves off 
and laying it on it. The next thing then, we, ugh, come out 
with a ten foor slide that would go between the rows and pulled 
it with a mule. Well, today, you see, we got the two-wheeled 
wagon.^ 
That Beech, his father, and his brother were still splitting stalks 
with a knife and slipping it over the tobacco stick as late as the 1920's is 
slightly unusual, but not unheard of by any means. In their bulletin, 
Tobacco in North Carolina, the Occupational Analysis Unit of the 
United States Employment Service for North Carolina indicates this 
old-fashioned practice was still occassionally encountered .15 Certainly 
9 
the practice of priming was by far the more common practice at this time. 
After seeing how well the communal working arrangement operated 
among the Slates, the Moorefields, and their neighbors, I was surprised 
to learn later from Beech Slate that this communal effort is, in fact, 
a relatively recent development in his area and came about only after 
a mechanical tobacco stringer was cooperatively bought. According to 
Beech, when the stringer was bought, neighbors traded their labor in 
the fields and barns for the right to use the stringer for their own 
tobacco. These tobacco stringers, basically a sewing machine with a 
conveyor belt which carries the leaves through a sewing mechanism, are 
much faster than the older hand stringing process. A layer of leaves is 
laid between two uprights on the conveyor (to mark the width), a four 
foot "tobacco stick" is laid across the stem ends of these leaves, 
and another layer of leaves is put over the stick. The two layers of 
leaves are then sewn together, thereby sandwiching the stick between 
them. This is then taken from the machine, carries the few feet to 
the barn door, and handed up to people in the barn who hang it from 
the tier poles beginning from the roof and working back and down. The 
speed of the conveyor carrying the leaves through the sewing head can 
be adjusted. The Slates and Moorefields run it fast—too fast, in fact, 
for poor amateurs (such as folklorists) to keep up. 
Cooperative labor was not as common prior to the coming of the 
tobacco stringer because—according to Beech Slate—tobacco crops were 
smaller, families were larger, and time was not at such a premium as 
it is today. The exception to this was during wood-cutting season. 
Several families would often have communal "wood choppings" in order 
to get enough wood with which to cure everyone's tobacco. These 
wood choppings and firings were also times for staying up late, playing 
music, and having dances and parties—often called "frolics" in Patrick 
10 
County. The fairly recent practice of firing with oil, gas, or even 
electricity instead of wood has just about done away with wood choppings 
and, hence, the other social activities which went with them. 
The older way of stringing, no longer used by the Slates and Moore- 
fields, is slower. It incorporates a wooden rack which holds the tobacco 
stick (see drawing) to which the leaves are to be attached. 
String is looped around the stem end of the leaves, the leaves are then 
flipped over to the other side of the stick, and the process is repeated 
until the end of the stick is reached. The sticks are then hung in the 
barn in the same manner as is still used today. Though slower than the 
mechanical stringer, a good hand can string a stick in much less than a 
minute. 
The newest way to house tobacco is to pack it in bulk barns. The 
leaves are tightly packed into metal racks which are lifted by a chain 
hoist arrangement and slid into the barn (which resembles a motor freight 
trailer) where it is packed as tightly as possible. Heated air is then 
forced with fans through the barn, thus curing the tobacco. As bulk 
barns are very expensive, most farmers in the Blue Ridge region, who 
do not grow enough tobacco to justify their expense, neither want them 
nor need them. Their main advantage is that they can cure a lot more 
tobacco in one small space, thus eliminating the need for several 
conventional curing barns. 
Tobacco leaves, especially those of the flue-cured variety, do not 
all ripen at the same time; consequently, the leaves are harvested as 
they ripen, beginning, of course, with those nearest the ground which 
mature earliest. Each time a field's ripe leaves are harvested is 
known as a "priming," hence Beech might speak of his "first priming" 
11 
or "fourth priming." Usually, fields are primed five to seven times during 
a season, beginning with "first primings" or "lugs" and progressing up the 
plant as the other leaves mature to prime "cutters" and, finally, "leaf" 
or "tips." "First priming," therefore, refers to the time sequence of 
picking, whereas "first primings" refers to the leaves harvested during 
that time. 
Both the mechanics and knowledge required for correct priming of 
tobacco, though not conceptually difficult, require practice. Usually, 
three leaves are picked from a plant at one priming. The person priming 
slowly walks between the rows, continually stooped, breaking the 
leaves off as he or she progresses down the row. Everyone must, of course, 
know what rows are being or have been worked ahead of him. 
The leaves must be grasped near the stalk and broken off with a 
quick downward twist of the wrist. This process is actually very fast; 
it takes only about two or three seconds per plant. As the leaves are 
picked, they are flipped under the opposite arm until there are enough 
to unload into the "slide." At the slide, they are all placed with the 
stems facing the same direction in order to facilitate unloading 
later onto the stringing machine. This process is repeated ad infiniturn 
until the entire field is primed, usually several hours or work. 
Priming is only done after the sun has been up long enough to evaporate 
most of the dew from the leaves, for wet leaves are very brittle 
(sometimes pronounced "brikkle"). As the day warms up and the leaves dry, 
they become more flexible and are less likely to be damaged. Priming, 
therefore, is very hot, dusty work. Also, as the heat of the day in¬ 
creases, the tobacco leaves exude a very sticky "tar" which, after 
an hour or so of priming, coats the arms, hands, and clothes of the 
workers. All in all, the job of priming tobacco is, in almost all 
respects, hot, dirty, and unpleasant. The enjoyable parts of the job 
12 
are the rest breaks, taken usually after a slide has been loaded and taken 
to a shady place to sit until moved to where the load will be strung onto 
sticks and put into the barn for curing. These breaks are a time to 
loaf in the shade, play jokes on each other, talk about how hot it is, 
and sooth the body with a cold drink and a package of "Nabs" (Nabisco 
crackers usually with a peanut butter filling). It is also a wonder¬ 
ful time for folklore fieldworkers, who have been doing their best to 
prime as well and as fast as the old hands, to pester people with simple- 
minded questions and picture taking. Thankfully, most people would rather 
endure these childish questions than get back to priming! 
Shortly before the lunch break, a few of the women and girls 
leave for "the house" to fix lunch for everyone. At lunch time, 
everyone walks or rides in, glad the morning is over and ready to eat. 
Before eating, of course, one must clean up. The dirt or dewy mud is 
either scraped off of the shoes or the wearer simply takes his or her 
shoes off and goes barefooted. The sticky tobacco tar, however, is more 
tenacious than simple dirt or grease. Soaps have almost no effect on 
the stuff. The ingenious solution is to take a green tomato, crush 
it in the hands, and let the juice dissolve the tar. After washing 
with a tomato or two, the residue is simply washed off with water from 
the outside spigot or hose. 
After cleaning up, everyone troops into the house and crowds around 
the kitchen table laden with food. On the days I was visiting, the meals 
were prepared by Sally Slate (Beech Slate's sister-in-law), Tim's widowed 
mother who partly owned the tobacco then being worked. The lunches 
consisted of canned creamed corn, green beans (called "snaps" by a couple 
of the older workers, a term more commonly heard further east), sliced 
tomatoes, boiled potatoes, cabbage prepared as slaw (really, non-vinegary 
kraut), fried chicken, fried fat back, store-bought chocolate and cheese 
13 
cake (with cherry topping), and iced tea to drink. The meal time is full 
of talk, gossip, and jokes and passes quickly. After about thirty to 
forty-five minutes, the break is over and it is back to work. A few of 
the women remain to clean up the kitchen and dishes, and when that is 
completed, they will rejoin the others to help string tobacco. 
After the tobacco is primed for the day and lunch is eaten, every¬ 
one goes to the barn which is to be loaded. The mechanical stringer is 
situated so that the discharge end of the conveyor is near the entrance 
and a slide is pulled and/or pushed by a tractor (a small Ford in the 
Slate's case) parallel to the stringer and about three or four feet from 
it. When the stringer is set up and ready to go, generally two people 
remove the leaves from the slide and place the leaves on a shelf attached 
Two or three other people, usually Sally Slate, Margie Moorefield, and one 
other (hopefulle not the slow folklorist!) take the leaves and quickly 
spread them as evenly as possible between the vertical length indicators 
on the conveyor belt, making sure to keep the stem ends up against the 
back guide (so the leaves won't be missed as they go through the sewing 
head). The entire works then pass through the sewing mechanism (under 
the close scrutiny of Mrs. Moorefield) and are lifted from the conveyor 
(usually by Lisa Moorefield) and taken into the barn where a man standing 
on the lower tier poles takes the bundle and hands it to the man above 
him who hangs it. The separate sticks are packed moderately close 
together (closer than hurley, for example), but loose enough to allow 
some circulation between. The stringing and hanging process is fast- 
paced and hectic. Although much of the work takes place under a shed 
roof, it is still mid-afternoon hot—especially for those in the barn. 
14 
When the housing process is completed for the day, the barn must 
be fired. The Slates' barns were originally designed for wood firing, 
but were converted to oil, and then to gas (see figure which shows the 
barn as it was originally laid out for wood firing). 
Gas heaters give off very little smoke and are easily controllable. The 
tobacco is slowly heated until, after about three days, it reaches 
150° to 160° Fahrenheit. It stays at this temperature for a couple 
more days, and is then allowed to cool for a day or so before the barn 
is opened. Obviously, the barn is chinked or covered tightly in order 
to hold the heat. Vents in the roof or the eaves provide controlled 
air circulation. 
When the barn is opened, the sticks of cured tobacco are removed and 
the "sheeting" process begins. "Sheeting" is packing the cured tobacco 
leaves into "sheets" of burlap. The burlap is laid out on the ground 
and a heavy cylindrical cardboard or tin form (either bought or handmade 
and measuring about four feet in diameter and two-and-a-half feet in 
height) is placed on top of the sheet and packed—round and round—full 
of tobacco. The butt ends, or stems, always point out. As the tobacco 
is added to the form, it is periodically packed down tightly by someone 
(Tim Slate) walking around on it. When the form is filled to overflowing, 
it is removed and the corners of the burlap sheet are tied together, thus 
making a "bundle." Two hundred and fifty pounds is the maximum weight 
that can be sold in one bundle. The bundle is then rolled aside and 
another made. 
Barns are often unloaded and the tobacco sheeted in the mornings 
before priming begins. The slight morning dampness keeps the leaves 
"in order" (called "in case" in the hurley regions), thus the leaves are 
15 
less likely to shred or break. They absorb just enough moisture to 
keep them slightly limber. 
Many mornings, before priming (or instead of priming), but usually 
after sheeting, the plants are topped, suckered, and/or sprayed. Topping 
is the process of breaking or cutting off the flower of the plant in order 
to cause more leaf growth. Suckering is removing the leaves beginning 
to grow between the main leaves and stalk just as one might sucker a 
tomato plant. It is during these two processes, both done at the same 
time, that many pests, such as horn worms and grasshoppers, are removed 
and killed. Today, there are chemical sprays which help reduce the 
amount of time required for suckering and insect and disease control. 
Neither Beech nor his young nephew, Tim, particularly like the way 
tobacco is handled today. Beech especially remembers when tobacco was 
handled with extreme care and respect. The idea of sheeting tobacco— 
especially the act of walking on it—rather than grading it and tying it 
16 
into neat "hands" is particularly disliked by those who learned to work 
it with the old respect. 
The most striking material culture items associated with the 
harvesting and curing of flue-cured tobacco in Patrick County, as well 
as elsewhere, are the curing barns themselves and the vehicles used 
to transport the primed leaves from the field to the barn. 
The older barns on the Sally Slate farm are typical of the older 
curing barns found throughout the flue-cured tobacco regions of 
Virginia and North Carolina.17 One of the Slate's barns is illustrated 
/ <- 
below. This barn was built in 1927 by Sally Slate's late husband, Lem 
16 
(Beech's brother). It is of chestnut logs hewn on two sides and V-notched 
at the corners. There are twelve log rounds and all sides—except that 
portion of the front under the shed roof—are covered with one-by-four 
to one-by-eight vertical pine boards. The entire building is red-clay- 
mud chinked. The foundation and fireboxes are of rock and mud and the 
floor is simply leveled dirt. 
The tier poles inside are arranged five wide with the inside three 
being six rows high and the outside two being five rows high. This, of 
course, is due to the slope of the roof toward the eaves. The tier poles 
are of five or six inches in diameter and are arranged as shown below. 
The Slates and Moorefields fire most of their tobacco barns with 
oil today, although their barns were originally built to be fired 
with wood. In fact, most barns have the firebox in which wood was 
burned still in place. The configuration of the flues as they were 
found when the barn was first constructed and until the wood system was 
replaced by oil burners, is shown below. 
The "slides" into which the primed leaves are loaded for transport 
to the barn are long and narrow, originally narrow enough to pass between 
the rows, but gradually widened slightly when the practice of terracing 
tobacco gained popularity. These terraces, about eight-foot wide strips 
of clear ground every five or six rows, make the use of tractors to 
pull the slides practical. Prior to this development, slides were pulled 
by a single mule or horse, using a narrow-width single tree in order not 
to brush against the very fragile plants and break them. Although the 
slides used by Beech and his neighbors today are two-wheeled, they are 
17 
still often referred to as "slides." In fact, the newer two-wheeled wagon 
is nothing more than an old-style slide box put on an axle and rolled in¬ 
stead of put on runners and dragged. During the height of priming, the 
available number of wheeled slides is invariably exhausted, so the older 
runnered ones are pressed into service—pulled by tractor, however, as are 
the wheeled ones. 
Lem Slate made the sled drawn below. The body is made of rough-cut 
one-inch pine planks and the runners of rough-cut two-by-ten oak boards. 
The top rail on each side is designed so that it can be lowered or raised 
as needed. A burlap sheet is nailed to the top rail and to the rail 
below it, thus preventing any leaves from sliding between them. Though 
originally pulled by a single mule, it is today pulled by a Ford tractor. 
The newer two-wheeled slide shows considerable folk innovation. Like 
the older runnered slide, the sides of the wheeled variety can also 
be raised or lowered as needed. The burlap sides of the two-wheeled 
slide are attached to thin poplar poles which, in turn, are fastened 
into V-notch slots by sections of innertube nailed to the immovable ends 
of the slidebox. As a side is lowered to the next level, the burlap 
sheeting is rolled up on the pole and the pole is fastened into the 
next lower V-notch slot with another section of innertube. Both the 
idea of having slides that are adjustable and putting a slide-box on 
wheels were introduced into the Claudeville section by Benton Moorefield. 
Benton does not recall exactly where he got the ideas, he just remembers 
It 
"seeing it someplace.

Burley cultivation in the Blue Ridge is much less agri-business oriented 
than are even the smallest flue-cured operations, such as the Slate's and 
Moorefield's. The reasons for this are many. First, allotment size 
is much smaller. Since the monetary return per pound of hurley is consid¬ 
erably more than for the flue-cured variety, much smaller allotments can 
be economically feasible. Smaller allotments—many are for only a 
portion of an acre—make the use of expensive machinery less necessary. 
Second, the requirements of hurley cultivation itself require less 
capital outlay and man-hours of labor than do flue-cured. For example, 
the entire hurley plant is harvested at one time, hence the practice of 
priming is eliminated. Also, since hurley is air-cured, there is no need 
for special barns, elaborate flue systems, and costly gas or oil burners. 
I have seen, for example, hurley being cured on a scaffolding arrangement 
built under a large overhanging rock. 
Third, the amount of hurley grown in the Blue Ridge is small because 
the nearest market is too distant to be convenient. All tobacco farming 
is closely controlled by USDA regulations and guidelines. So, even 
though an area—such as the North Carolina Blue Ridge—may be climatically 
suitable, market availability and allotment size can and do restrict the 
growth of hurley production in some cases. In the Blue Ridge, therefore, 
hurley is only a minor crop, both in total regional income and in numbers 
of people who grow it. 
The growing of any marketable crop involves—to lesser or greater 
degree—knowledge aquired in traditional ways; whether plowing behind a 
mule or aboard an air-conditioned tractor, the knowledge of "how to do 
it" is learned by doing. The cultivation of tobacco, partly because of 
its long history and economic importance and partly because of the 
19 
plant itself, requires a great amount of folk knowledge. Judging when the 
plant is "in order" or "in case;" learning how to "prime" tobacco leaves; 
knowing how to control the heat during curing in a tobacco barn; and 
knowing how to construct the curing barn itself are all traditionally 
learned. Knowing that green tomato juice is the best dissolver of tobacco 
tar is not learned from any USDA publication. 
Other aspects of tobacco farming are traditional as well. Building 
"slides" and "two-wheeled" wagons" or sitting down to lunch all demon¬ 
strate traditional knowledge. To explore all of the traditions and folk- 
life practices which surround the cultivation of tobacco—even if this could 
be done—would be an enormous task. Even this brief look at some of the 
traditional aspects involved in simply harvesting flue-cured tobacco 
and the short note about some of the differences between flue-cured and 
burley farming in the Blue Ridge points out just how complex the problems 
can be.

^ Good illustrations of early tobacco barn types are in Herndon^ 
(1969), p. 28. By initially curing in the field, the tobacco plant 
loses considerable weight due to moisture loss and the brittleness of 
the leaves is reduced, making both loading and transporting easier and 
less destructive.

13 There is only one botanical species of tobacco grown commercially 
in the United States, Nicotiana tabacum. There are, however, twenty- 
six types of this species recognized both by the U. S. Department of 
Agriculture and the tobacco trade. Each type is grown in a relatively 
well-defined geographic area for two reasons: growing conditions (soil, 
climate) and available marketing facilities. The only two types grown 
in marketable quantities in the environs of the Blue Ridge mountains of 
the Virginia/North Carolina border are flue-cured type 11A and, to the 
west of this area, burley type 31.

A "hand" is a fist-sized bundle of tobacco leaves (about four 
or five) bound together at the stem end by wrapping a leaf around them 
and tucking the loose end into the bundle. For more tobacco (especially 
burley) terminology, see: Jim Wayne Miller, "The Vocabulary and Methods 
of Raising Burley Tobacco in Western North Carolina," North Carolina
