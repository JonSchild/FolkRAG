On Columbia's glorious shore— 
The land of peace and freedom. 
Where two lovers' hearts adore.

We've tried you to amt se ; 
So don't forget the happy pair— 
Sammy and little Suse.

You Tell Me that You Love Me. 
" 
Hand in Hand We Wander." 
Written by F.DDIE SANDS, and 
sung by KEATING and SANDS. 
You tell me that you love me 
With a 
passion pure and high 
As the heavens that bend above me 
When the day-god warms the sky ; 
You vow that you will cherish 
My memory whilst you live, 
That you will let no feeling perish 
While you've life-blood yet to give. 
You say that you are truthful 
As aught beneath the sun, 
That you will let. no ivy ruthful 
My flowers of bliss o'errun ; 
Yet of hearts I'm an inspector, 
And I 
know thine, link by link, 
At its founts of bubbling nectar 
Ally one that will may drink. 
M ORAL. 
And although you may replenish 
It for me, my dainty lip 
Will never taste the remish 
From the goblet others sip. 
Railroad Lyrics. 
Written by EDDIE SANDS, of KEATING and SANDS. 
Am: •' Corning through the•Rye.' 
If an engine meet an engine, 
Coming round a 
curve ; 
If they smash track, train and lender. 
What do they deserve? 
Not a 
penny's pay to any, 
So far as we observe, 
But all acquit the engineer. 
When coining round a 
curve. 
If an engine meet a 
steamer, 
Coming through the draw ; 
If they crush or drown the imblic, 
Need we go to law? 
If the engineer was careless, 
Perhaps he's rather raw ; 
They don't discharge an honest fellow, 
Coming through the draw. 
If a 
steamer chase a 
steamer, 
Running up to time ; 
If they burst their pipes and bi,ilers, 
Where's the ini:i;uy crime? 
Should a 
jury, ia 
fury, 
Make them pay ,, ne dime, 
Or send the officer; to prison, 
Running up to time. 
If they maim or kill a 
-oody, 
Or a 
body's wife ; 
Need a 
body sue a 
lydv 
For bairrtwe limb, or life? 
If you sue for damages, 
For pay for \\ int you lost.

As 
sung by KEATING and SaNDS at Tony Pastor's, New York. 
III Bo 4011 City there once did dwell 
A family by the name of Greens, 
They had a 
son whose name was Si, 
I 
le was very fond of beans. 
Ile cat beans for breakfast, beans for dinner, 
And beans for lunch and tea ; 
And he got six months in the penitentiary 
For robbing a 
beanery. 
In the penitentiary they worked him hard, 
Till he got very thin and lean ; 
In the glass one day he saw his form, 
And he thought himself a 
1.ean. 
Ile rushed to the glass, but they held him fast, 
'Flue keeper says '' What do you mean?" 
Oh, tie me loose, and give me room, 
For I 
want to get that bean, 
At the expiration of his six months 
lie got his ticl:et of leave ; 
Ile \vent thro:igh the streets with grief and shame, 
This story you mu.a believe. 
Oh, he went home that very night, 
And in his snores and dreams 
He hollered out, at the to; of his voice,

The Clam Merchant. 
Written by ED. SANDS, of K EATING and SANDS. 
Come all my jovial pardincrs, and listen to my rhymes, 
While I 
will tell Irmo you all a 
story of the times. 
'Tis of a 
gallant clam seller, who ninny a 
clam had dug, 
Until he saved enough of cash to make himself quite snug. 
One day, as he was peddling his clams along the streets, 
A young and tender maiden he chanced him for to meet. 
She bent upon him one sweet glance as he his wares did cry, 
Which made his heart to palpitate, and hove a 
heavy sigh. 
This clam man he did look on hr, and she did look on him ; 
He gazed until his google eyes grew weak and likewise dim. 
Then up he spoke and says to her all in a 
clamerous voice : 
"Oh maiden, that ' ere look cf yourn has made my heart rejoice." 
Now she was one of them ' ere kind that knew a 
thing or two; 
She did see at one fell swoop what he did mean to do. 
So she replied unto his words, " I'm but an orphan child, 
Brought U 
p 
in the home for Wanderers, which makes me 
meek and mild." 
At this the noble clam man he did mark her for his own, 
And kindly he invited her to make his house her own. 
With tears a 
streaming down her checks, she said she did 
not mind ; 
Then he jumps in his cart, while she jumps on behind. 
Now she wai one of that ' ere sort what knew a 
thing or two , 
She did SCQ at one MI swoop what he did mean + o 
do, 
Tilt CLAM MERCHANT, 
Continued. 
So she replied unto his words, " I'm but an orphan child i 
Brought up in the Home for Wanderers ; which makes me 
meek and mild:" 
Now listen to me, pardiners, while I 
a 
Ftory tell 
Of all the sad disasters which this clarnislt man befell. 
Which, while he gave her lager beer, and thought her 2afe 
at rest, 
She was going through his trunks, and doing her level bet. 
Oh, while he thought to wreak her ruin, he dosed her bitter 
beer, 
She deftly threw it on the floor, which to him it did not appear: 
Then into his tumbler she poured a 
powder vile, 
And thus preserved the virtuousness of this little orphan child. 
Now, my dear pardners, when next the clam man woke, 
lie gazed tino his horror that he was then dead broke. 
..!2.; ,
;, seized his cherished oyster-knife, and drove it into his 
whizzen, 
i,h.„1.-k-wAnd now the life that once was his it it ain't no longer his'n. 
This meek and lowly orphan girl by this one stroke of her'n, 
DA come into affluence, for which s'le long did yeirn. 
And now, dear pardners, she lives in Avenue Five, 
having made an ample fortune by selling clams alive. 
Now, all my roving libertines, take warning by me here, 
Whenever you dose a 
girl's beverage, be sure she drinks 
the beer ; 
Or else, like this 'ere clam man, you will pick up things 
that's mild, 
Just like this female wanderer, this little orphan child,

Oh, squeeze me, Joe ; squeeze me, Joe, 
It makes me feel so jolly, you know; 
Oh, squeeze me, Joe ; squeeze me, Joe,

For There's No One to Care Now for Me. 
Written and composed by A. H. M ORTON, 
Alone and forsaken, no kindred or friend, 
Full of sorrow and pain do I 
roam, 
Only waiting the time when my sufferings shall end, 
And I'm borne to my last happy home. 
Of the joys of this world I've had my full share, 
But ' tis bard in life's winter to be 
lIomeless and friendless—the folks at me stare, 
For there's no one to care now for me. 
Once I 
was young and joyous and gay, 
And my heart was light, happy, and free, 
The hours filled with pleasure sped quickly away, 
Life held nought but contentment for me. 
But, alas, what a 
change ! those bright scenes I 
recall, 
Those scenes I 
shall never more sec ; 
I'm alone, unprotected, forsaken by all. 
For there's no one to care now for me.

I've wandered very far away 
From the clime where I

To cheer me when in pain, 
I 
want to see the cotton fields,

Oh the good old days are passed and gone, 
I 
sigh for them in vain ; 
I

And the doar old home again. 
I'm left all sad and lonely now, 
When my days are very few, 
My wife and children both are gone, 
I 
don't know what to do ; 
My master too, he may be dead, 
His hair was turning gray, 
Oh, let me see that good old home, 
Before I 
pass away. 
Oh, the good old days, etc. 
When I 
was free I 
left that land, 
Where the days are bright and fair, 
Where missus spoke to me so kind, 
When 1 
was bowed with care ; 
I 
left that home no friends to find, 
My heart was tilled with pain, 
Oh, take me to that good old home, 
To see it once again.

PAR back in my musings my thoughts have been 
To the cot where the hours of my childhood were 
I 
loved all its rooms, the pantry and hall, 
But that blest old kitchen was dearer than all. 
Its chairs and its table, none brighter could be, 
For all its surroundings were sacred to me; 
To the nail in the ceiling, the latch on the door, 
And I 
loved every crack in that old kitchen door, 
cast, 
passed; 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the old kitchen floor, the old kitchen lbor, 
How dear to my heart is the old kitchen floor. 
I 
remember the fire- place, with mouth high and wide, 
The old-faillioned oven that stood by its si he, 
Out of which, each Thanksgiving, came puldings and pies, 
That fairly bewildered and dazzled my eyes; 
And then, too, St. Nicholas slyly and still 
Cain , down every Christmas our stockings to fill; 
But the dearest memories I've laid up in store, 
Is the mother that trod on that old kitchen floor 
Oh, the old, fil/st 
Day : n

tik.1 
foot steps krn , busy, In r 
always 
ror it seemed to me Ilion that she knew not a 
care, 
The smile was so gentle her face used to e. ear; 
I 
remember with pleasure what joy filled our eyes, 
When she told us the stories that children so prize; 
They were new aver y 
night though we heard them beforA 
From her lips at the wheel on the old kitchen floor. 
Oh, the old, ctc, 
To night these old visions come back at their will 
But the wheel and its music forever are still; 
The hand is moth-eaten, the wheel laid away, 
And the fingers that turned it lie moldering to clay: 
The hearth-stone, so sacred, is just as ' twas they, 
And the voices of children ring out there again; 
The sun through the window looks in as of yore, 
But it sees stranger feet on the old kitchen floor. 
I 
ask not for honor, but this I 
would crave, 
That when the lips speaking are closed in the grave, 
Oh, the old,&" 
My children will gather their own at their side, 
And tell of their mother who long ago died; 
'Twould lie more enduring, far dearer to me, 
Than inscription on marble or granite could be,

It is only a 
sweet little letter, 
In my hand that I 
tenderly hold, 
From the one who is dearer and better 
Than the treasure of jewels and gold. 
Many days my poor heart has been sighing 
For this mark of affee:ion to see, 
So then now there is no use denying 
I'm as happy as happy can be.

Just a

It is only a 
sweet little letter, 
But its pages are fill'd with kind words, 
Whose affection is dearer, yes better, 
Than sweet music or carols of birds. 
Oh, they waken glad mem'ries to cheer me, 
As I 
wander afar on life's sea, 
While the sweetest of tiloughts linger near me, 
I'm as happy as happy can be. 
It is only a

It is only a

But it tells of a 
heart that is true, 
Of a 
love that grows brighter and better 
As the days fade away from my view. 
Yes, it breathes of the fondest devotion, 
That will cling now and ever to me, 
And my heart in its tend'rest emotion, 
I'm as happy as happy can be.

Oh, I've just come here to see my gal, I 
love her, too, quite well. 
She lives in yonder cottage, and with her I 
must dwell. 
She is handsome, fair and beautiful, so gentle and so tall, 
In fact she takes the shine away from all. 
We met one fine day, it was in the month of May, 
While leisurely meandering the festive gay Broadway. 
She winked at me, I 
winked at her, and next day was to meet 
This charmer with the pretty little feet.

I 
met him only yesterday while walking down Broadway, 
And he has -been taking liberty to follow me all de way. 
I 
only wish he'd waited until I 
had come out; 
He'd make me feel so happy by taking a 
little walk, 
But now he's gone and won't come back, I

And now before we part 
I

Well, what is it, Pete, go on and speak, 
I'll listen with all my heart 
To what you have to say,

He has left his last year's coat, 
We will put it into soak, 
And not be entirely broke, 
Baby mine, baby mine, 
And we'll catch another bloke, baby mine. 
We will buy him no more beer, 
Baby mine, baby mine; 
He has skipped off on his ear, 
Baby mine, baby mine. 
But won't we make him cry, 
If to find us he does try ? 
We will give him a 
black eye, 
Baby mine, baby mine, 
We 
will starve him on custard pie, baby mine. 
BANJO SOLO--Sting by Andy Colimn. 
Old uncle Pete had a 
dream last night, 
Looking out the window he saw a 
sight, 
All about a 
story I 
am going to tell, 
Will make you all feel so well. 
Chicken in the hen-roost dancing juber, 
Monkey in the garden playing base, 
Ducks and the gander and old grey nag, 
Singing in the chorus rally round the flag. 
Owls in the tree winking, blinking, 
Cats in the pantry chasing mice, 
Bugs in the attic playing poker, 
Spider in the cobweb shaking dice. 
Chicken in the henroost drinking egg nog, 
Pig double shuffle in the sty, 
Massa swearing at the skeeters. 
Bald headed spiders coaxing flies. 
Behind the hen- house on my knees, 
I 
thought I 
heard a 
rooster sneeze, 
Sneezed so hard with the hooping cough, 
Sneezed his head and tail both oft: 
Elephant up a 
gum- tree smoking his pipe, 
Bug in swimming bawling r)i- life, 
Sally in the garden sifting peas, 
Came and kiss me if you plea,ie.

When you left the old plantation, old man, 
I 
didn't know where you went ; 
I 
thought you had joined the soldiers, 
And the Lord knows how I 
felt. 
I 
couldn't sleep a 
bit at night, 
My heart was filled with pain; 
And, Uncle Zeke, I 
never thought 
That I'd see you again. 
CHORUS. 
I 
feel so loose and careless 
That my heart is filled with joy, 
Let us do a 
step for the white folks here 
Before we say good-bye. 
Oh, now that I 
am home again 
And see my friends once more, 
Things have changed a 
heap, my boy, 
Since I've been here before. 
I've traveled this wide world over and over, 
And many sights I've seen, 
But I 
love the old plantation 
Better than any place I've seen. 
CHORUS. 
I 
feel so loose and careless, ece. 
Now that you are home once more, 
You're never gwine to leave the old Kentucky shore, 
But stay with me and the little ones at home, 
And sing and dance for us once more, 
Far away from wife and children, 
Still I 
plod my way along.

ORIGINAL SONG AND DANCE. 
By COTTON & BIRDUE. 
When we were together, in that sunny laud. 
Where all's Eternal Spring, 
We'd wander through the cotton fields, 
And hear the Jay-bird sing. 
We'd hunt the Old Raccoon, 
By the glimmer of the Moon, 
Whene'er we had a 
chance. 
At evening, when the boys were on the green!), 
We'd join them in the festive dance!

When we were a

Down in that sunny land; 
We'd take them rowing on the Lake, 
Or strolling on the strand ; 
We'd take the old Banjo, 
And together we would go 
And stay until the break of day! 
We wish those happy, happy days 
Had never passed away.

My Mary Anne's a 
teacher in a 
great big public school, 
She get's one thousand dollars every year, 
She has charge of all the .children, you'd never find a 
fool, 
For Mary gives them all the proper steer. 
Oh, she studied Greek and Latin, real Frt itch and Titnbuctoo, 
German, Spanish, Turk and Hindoostan, Portuguese, Irish 
and Jerusalem Hebrew; 
Such and education has my Mary Anne. 
CHORUS. 
She's a 
darling, she's a 
daisy, 
She's a 
dumpling, she's a 
lamb; 
You should hear her play the pi-an-a, 
Such an education has my Mary Anne. 
My Mary Anne's a 
lady, no contemptible coquette, 
When I 
see her sure my heart goes in a &tune; 
She is thoroughly conversant wid the art of etiquette, 
And at cards she'd beat old Hoyle himself a 
game. 
Oh, she'd play you whist or cribbage, forty-tives or casino, 
And she'll dale the cards just like a gamblin man, poker or 
peaknuckle, or Sanky oh Pedro, 
Such an education has my Mary Anne. 
She's a 
darling, &c. 
My Mary Anne's a 
dancer in the art of terpsichore, 
You should see her forward four and alatnandi 
She'd break up all the lumber that you'd put down on the floor, 
Such a 
heavy stepper is my Mary Anne. 
Oh, she'd dance you the mazourka, a 
polka orquadrille, 
Reel or jig or shuffle in the sand, schottishe or theGerman you 
could'ut keep her still. 
Such an education has my Mary Anne.

The Sheeneys one day all flew poll mell, 
But the clerk he told them to go to

That's elegant graft for the Sheeney's 
There was Moses in the clothing line, 
And Isaacs too who sold snyde wine. 
They swore the clerk was a

'Twas terrible times for Sheeneys. 
There was Jacobs who kept the jewelry store.

Got full of Dutch beer and kicked and swore. 
'Twas terrible times for Sheeneys. 
Solomon the butcher so big and stout 
And Levi who had three balls hung out ; 
All yelled for revenge with a 
terrible shout. 
'Twas tocrible times for Sheeneys. 
Mr. Cohen who sold old second-hand clothes, 
And Abraham with the terrible nose, 
Cried out—" For vy is de reason of dose." 
Oh, terrible times for Sheeneys.

I

And in my own dear far off distant home 
I 
Iiv'd so fancy free !

Eva, Eva, Tell me where my Eva's gone, 
She has left here to sigh and to mourn, 
Can't you tell me where my Eva's gone ! 
And in this that seem'd a

I 
was so proud and brave ; 
And when I 
woke and found ' twas but a 
dream 
I 
found myself a 
slave!

I

To see my home so fair; 
For now I

And life is full of care.

Sung by HINES and BLOSSOM. 
Oh good evening to you, one and all, 
We have just come out to sing a 
little ditty, 
It's about the times that's past and gone, 
When we used to work on the grand old Mississippi. 
The passengers they used to wink, 
And look at us so sly, 
Because we'd dance and do our breaks, 
And throw our feet so high. 
But when we get through our little ditty, 
We'll go back again to the grand old Mississippi. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
Now, white folks, we can no longer stay, 
Or the folks at home will think we've run away. 
But the next time we visit your great city 
We hope you won't forget our little ditty. 
Our old massa was as good a 
man 
As ever you did see ; 
He used to feed us on hoe cake, 
And sometimes hominy. 
Now when we get done our little ditty, 
We'll go back agin to the grand old Mississippi. 
(Repeat last two lines.)

De War. 
OLD MAN NEGRO CHARACTER SONG. 
Words and Music by ROY LESLIE. 
Oh, here I 
am kind friends, 
A poor old colored man, 
heart, broken by trouble and despair, 
Who no one seems to care for 
But the Heavenly Father above, 
Who I 
know still keeps a 
home for me there, 
I've wandered for years 
Homeless on this earth, 
I'm old and I 
cannot work no more, 
And it was a 
sorry day the time I 
came away 
From my.old home in Carolina ' for de war. 
Cnortus. 
Oh, give we back the old home of my birth, 
And I 
never will leave it any more, 
For I'll have it place to live, 
And they'll bury me when I'm dead, 
In my old home in Carolina 'for de war. 
Oh, well do I 
remember when I 
was a 
little child 
A 
playing around the boiler in the mill, 
And de 8ound of all de wheels as dey crushed de sugar 
cane, 
Are humming in my ears plainly still, 
And well do I 
remember when our day's work was done 
how we'd dance at night upon de old log cabin floor 
Dey can talk about the free man, 
Rut I'd rather be a 
slave, 
In toy old home in Carolina 'for de war. 
And now kind friends I 
must be going, 
I 
cannot sing no more, 
These happy recollections give me pain, 
Although I'm Oki and feeble I'll try to reach my home, 
For soon my soul my father he will claim, 
It was a 
sad mistake, 
But now it is too late, 
Whon de North and de South were made one, 
For we den had enough to eat 
And we had a 
place to sleep, 
Many, many years ago when I 
was young.

Philadelphia. 
F; LONG, how I 
long, for my home in Kentuck, 
With its fields where I 
labored, so green. 
Where the possum and the coon, and the juicy wild duck, 
And the ' bacca so prime, I 
have seen: 
There I've fished from the banks of the Musella creek, 
And oft, in the shade of the night, 
Have I 
watched with my gun, nigh the old Salt Lick. 
For the game as it come to my sight. 
CHORUS. 
There is my old cabin home, 
There is my sisters and brother, 
There is my wife, joy of my life, 
My child, and the grave of my mother: 
That hut, my dear home, my log cabin home, 
With the bench that I 
stood at the door, 
Where, weary at night, from my work I 
would come, 
And there rest. ere I 
stepped on its floor. 
The calabash vine, that then clung to its walls, 
Oh ! ' Us dear in my memory still to me; 
And my master, who lives in his own handsome halls, 
Not so happy as then I 
could be.

That forever I 
faithful would prove--

And still there, all in life, I

DUTCH SONG AND DANCE. 
Sung by LARRY TOULEY. 
Oh, keep your seats a 
while, and I 
will sing to you 
The love I 
feel for a 
girl, they call ter duck- foot Sue. 
She is gentle and divine. long- waisted in the feet, 
Her heels stick out behind like a 
IS-karat beat. 
INSTRUCTIVE AND INTERESTING. 
But now I 
sing to you of the girl I 
love so well, 
She is second-handed maid in a 
Chinese laundry away out 
in Kalamozan. 
Her beauty was all she had, she was sailed like the author 
of a 
shad ; 
She had an India rubber lip, like the rudder of a 
ship ; with 
the razor she was bad. 
She wasn't very fat nor was she very thin, 
She looked when she was dressed like a 
straw in a 
barrel of gin. 
I 
took her to a 
ball to the Hordelyobel Club, 
It cost me a 
ten cent stamp for to fill her up with grub. 
Ifer eyes were indigo blue, she'd a 
voice like a 
kangaroo. 
She could chin for an hour with a 
forty horse power, and 
whistle like a 
steamboat, too. 
She'd ears like a 
Japanese fan, and a 
voice like a 
catamaran. 
She was chief engineer in a 
hash factory ( jig) away out in 
Kalamozan.

'Courtin 
Cards.—This Serieb of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such 9. way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by :dlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
fcispm doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
farther explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

Is not attracted ; the most delicate hints cOm beziven without danger of 
misunderstanding— also, the Floral language orLove. The whole form-
ing a 
rare amusement for young ladies and gentlemen. Read what two 
leading New York Papers say of it: 
The N. Y. Evening Mail writes 
" 
A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. FISHER'S, 98 Nas 
sau street, Galled the " Little Flirt." We 
cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as Nt-e think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of' flirting." Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any furthernecessity of explaining "how, when and 
where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the lm-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a 
neat 
ttle 
book, bound in Morocco leather , costing twenty-five cents, calltd the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. FISHER, No. 98 Nassau Street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the mean-
ing of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As 
there is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents 
might afford sonic innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to 
recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."
