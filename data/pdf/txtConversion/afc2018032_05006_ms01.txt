Summary of Interview: Suzanne Chapin-Donalson describes growing up in a culturally diverse 
neighborhood in Chicago. She talks about working with disadvantaged populations in Nashville, 
TN and Milwaukee, WI. She recalls working with dementia patients as her first introduction into 
psychiatric nursing. She explains she moved on to an in-patient hospital unit, which she says was 
an incredible learning experience. She currently is at an outpatient community support program, 
where she enjoys the team-based approach and continuity of care.

Introduction 
0.00.32 
Grew up on south side of Chicago, grew up near Hyde Park near university, went 
to public school. Youngest of three children. Diverse area: went to school with 
children from Asia, Africa, South American. So was used to being among a very 
mixed population. In high school, moved from city to suburbs (so that could 
attend high school that parents wanted interviewee to attend) and found this a 
“culture shock—I never accepted the move.” 
0.02.37 
Mother wanted interviewee to be nurse; interviewee reluctantly started in pre-
nursing program at UW-Milwaukee. “I right away knew I wanted to work in 
community nursing, because then I was able to work with a mix of cultures again, 
and that’s where I thought my heart was happiest.”  
0.03.30 
Initially thought that wanted to work in public health. But after degree, moved to 
Tennessee, and worked in Nashville with a very poor population, including AIDS 
patients and a TB unit. “This was the hospital people were sent when they had no 
money—and it was a very rewarding experience.” 
0.04.20 
After this, moved back to Milwaukee. “I found I always wanted to work with an 
underserved community, the area where their medical needs weren’t being 
addressed.” Worked in a nursing home, as a floor nurse, and then weekend 
supervision. “That taught me a lot on how to work with doctors, patients and 
families—prioritizing, getting needs addressed, being the advocate and the 
overseer of care.” 
0.05.31 
On first day at work: “It was always, ‘Can I do it?’ Because in nursing school, 
they were always like, ‘They’ll teach you how to do it once you start your job.’ 
And that was true … And you needed to learn their protocols … And the big thing 
in nursing is how you’re always going down a checklist. And that’s how you see 
the world, as a checklist of prioritizing needs and following the protocol. First you 
do this, and if that doesn’t work you do this … And if you call a doctor, you need 
to be able to show them what you’ve done, because you know what they’re going 
to ask you.” Knew all that when started both jobs, but still took time to “do it in 
their framework.”

0.07.10 
“I will say the first job I had in nursing, I was terrified, because I was not in the 
community where I went to nursing school. I had gone to school in Milwaukee, 
but I took the exam in Nashville … I didn’t have my co-workers with me or my 
fellow students or professors—they were a phone call away.” Example: learning 
how to mix an IV. Had thought they came prepared but was not at the Nashville 
hospital; found this scary but learned quickly. 
0.08.11 
Found one nurse, who had been a funeral director, of great help. “Being on an 
AIDS unit, we saw quite a few people pass away from AIDS. And from him I 
learned to feel comfortable and feel comfortable working with the dying and with 
the bodies after they passed away. That was very important, because I carried that 
knowledge and comfort to the next job, which was in the nursing home setting. 
During that time, I had lost my mother too, and that helped me learn how to feel 
comfortable talking to families and to doctors, bridging the gap with 
communication. That was a hard skill to learn, because the families are in despair, 
and you need to be their voice and picking up the phone and calling the doctor. 
Those are all skills you learn.” 
0.09.44 
Feels that learns by doing. “You have to feel comfortable doing it, and you have 
to feel comfortable asking: ‘I can’t quite do it yet.’” 
0.10.09 
On working with others: “Different places I’ve worked have had different ways of 
giving reports. When I worked in the hospital, there’d be a tape recording. We’d 
all sit and listen to the tape recording and take notes and discuss and decide who’s 
going to do what for the next shift. Other places found that very time-consuming 
and just had direct reports. During that time, you’re developing your plan of care 
and who’s responsible for what. And you kind of learn right away who you can 
depend on and how you’re going to follow up … Communication is absolutely 
key to success.” 
0.11.22 
“You learn very quickly [that you have to be able to read people, patients and 
staff] … I think it’s innate. I’ve asked myself that many times, and I’ve decided 
after all these years it’s innate … It’s the hairs on the back of my neck … and I’m 
99% correct when I sense something, maybe higher than that.” 
0.12.17 
On the early jobs: only worked on one floor of Nashville hospital, the hospital 
unit. The rest of the place was long-term, and interviewee’s unit would take 
patients from other floors if they became acutely ill—e.g., injuries down to bone 
that required extensive nursing care. “With that experience I decided I liked that 
kind of care. I didn’t like acute hospital care. These people were acutely ill, but 
they were also in the long-term setting.” Because of this, decided to take the 
nursing home job. “Because I was very close to my grandma and I just liked 
taking care of the aged population. I felt that they needed—that I was a good 
nurse and I wanted to provide good care. And I liked the idea of a state survey 
oversight and making sure that they were getting good care, and I wanted to be 
part of that.” 
0.14.24 
On the idea of ‘good care’: “Good care is respect, sincerity, thoroughness, 
following the good nursing care—like if they say you’re supposed to turn every 
two hours, you turn every two hours; if the head of a bed is supposed to be thirty 
degrees, it is thirty degrees. No skimping on care. Follow it by the book.” 
Page 3 of 8 
 
0.15.01 
Learned these qualities in nursing school and felt that she encouraged others to 
follow it where she found it lacking. 
0.15.33 
Worked in county nursing home outside of Milwaukee; worked at this job for five 
years. Became manager of dementia unit at this nursing home. “It was there that I 
got my first introduction to mental health care—psychiatric care. Because it was 
the dementia unit, we were very challenged by providing good care to dementia 
patients, who at times could be rather physical when you’re trying to provide care 
or have wandering behaviors. So, I would meet with the psychiatrist maybe once 
a month, and he would meet with the patients and prescribe medications. And it 
was our job to give him feedback and to document how the patients were 
responding—because the last thing we wanted to do was to over-sedate. Because 
if we over-sedated the patients, they could become delirious and have more 
falls—or become delirious because they were dehydrated … The risks of 
complication were pretty high because of the medication. And that was where my 
interest first grew in psychiatric medication.” 
0.17.33 
Before this job, “I had watched One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, that was about 
it. Nurse Ratchet was about my level of knowledge. And what I found really 
interesting were these flow sheets that we had to fill out at every shift about 
behaviors—we had to track behaviors. And you could actually see a change in 
behavior looking at these flow sheets. And I thought, ‘These drugs are really 
good.’ The state hates them … but if their wellbeing is enhanced or if it makes 
things worse, this is the best way to know. So that’s why I really enjoyed it.” 
0.18.37 
On relationship with psychiatrist: “It was a good relationship. He was a good 
listener, and he had a great sense of humor with the patients … He had his 
expertise and was always very quick to respond. If it was not his time to come … 
I would just call him … and he would take care of it.” “I took this very seriously, 
because I knew the state really needed this information. Because, if it’s not done 
right, then the patient suffers and we look bad as a facility, and we don’t want to 
be providing bad care—‘bad’ being overdosing the patient—because the risk of 
falls is so great.” An example: a married couple were on separate units, and 
wanted to be together, but when together, the man would slap the woman when 
out of sight of nurses. Medication helped the situation, allowing them to be 
together more, “so they could enjoy their time.” 
0.20.57 
Did a lot of IVs in Nashville; learned how to do this. 
0.21.16 
Interest in mental health continued to grow; obtained a Lancet book from 1840s 
containing lectures, e.g., from a doctor who ran an asylum. Doctor told students 
that ‘how you are on floor will affect how patients are,’ and examples of how he 
taught others to provide care, and how he provided care. “I was so fascinated by 
the clean atmosphere, the calm demeanor—and being present. If the patient wants 
to walk, you let them walk and provide them good shoes … Years later, I found 
out he was good friends with Charles Darwin. That got me going reading more 
and more of his chapters.” 
0.23.31 
Found out about a position opening up at a nearby psychiatric hospital, took this 
job which was “an incredible learning experience” in the late ’90s. Learned about 
drugs had never heard of before. Worked at this position for a couple of years. 
Unit had 22 beds, with adolescents at one end and adults/seniors at the other.

0.24.55 
On first impressions: “I was learning new words. I thought, ‘I’ll never be 
successful here, I don’t know what these words mean.’ Like ‘confabulation,’ that 
was the big word—I had never heard that before. ‘He’s confabulating!’ And all 
the new drugs. I thought I’d be quizzed on them.” Another challenge: learning the 
new protocols and recordkeeping arrangements at this hospital. 
0.25.39 
Had a “really good—excellent” mentor. “Giving report was very helpful, because 
I would hear how words were used. And the really good thing I learned working 
there was: We are not here to diagnose—that is not our role—we are here to 
support, as a nurse. And that was really good information … Because when we 
would sit in the back and report, we would often ‘He’s just a blah blah blah’—we 
would diagnose … But you are labelling as soon as you diagnose, and that is not 
our role. Sometimes when you look at patients … you might see diagnoses 
change. And nurses, we’re not supposed to muck with that.” 
0.27.11 
On ‘labelling’ patients: “It definitely can impact how you talk to the patient—how 
you approach them. I think it can lead to disrespect. You just have to be very 
acutely aware of your actions and staying away from those diagnoses. Yes, it’s 
nice to know what the doctor diagnosed, but you just leave that on the side-step 
and talk to them as the person. That’s the important part.” 
0.28.13 
Unit had several eating-disorder patients; these were challenging patients, because 
required a large amount of observation. So usually one nurse was assigned to 
work with them, to allow these observations to occur. Again, an important aspect 
of this care was learning to work with them as people outside of their diagnoses. It 
was important to “learn to talk to these patients about their ‘other life’ [i.e., their 
life outside of their diagnosis].” 
0.29.39 
These patients would have short-term stay in this unit and then transfer to a day 
unit downstairs. 
0.29.58 
“You grew very fond of these people. And I think it was reassuring for them to 
know us. And the longer I worked there—you just develop a nice rapport.” 
0.30.25 
On ‘rapport’ with patients: Nursing staff would do admission to this specific unit. 
On this 12-page form, you would ask some difficult questions. “A lot of tears 
would come out. And that was a very good learning experience for me, because I 
learned to ask very difficult questions. And during that time, you would build a 
good rapport—a therapeutic relationship. This might be the person’s first time in-
patient, and they’re very afraid, and you’re asking these very difficult questions. 
But you develop a skill of—sometimes there are questions you don’t want to ask, 
so you just say ‘Deferred.’ You know, ‘You better not ask that right now, because 
of why they’re here.’ Like if they were raped or something like that, you’re going 
to skip over that section.” 
0.31.49 
On learning this skill: “You look at their responses to other questions, how they 
responded. Like if they’ve been abused growing up. Also, there’s times you know 
that they’re so emotionally exhausted and can’t do all 12 pages, you do this 
section later. So, yeah, you just feel your way through out.” 
0.32.38 
Noted that some patients have strong specific attitudes toward particular 
medication with which they’ve had previous experiences. “I will say with 
computerized charting, it’s not as easy to put that information in as it used to be 
Page 5 of 8 
 
… In the old way, on a paper chart, it was actually easier to make that kind of 
report … Stuff like that misses.” 
0.33.31 
Worked at this job for 4-5 years. After this, moved to Madison in early 2000s and 
worked in an elderly-care program. Idea was to keep elderly in their home as long 
as possible, and out of hospital. Did this job for a couple of years. And then heard 
about another place in Madison about which was very excited and applied in 2005 
and got in. “It was the best job I ever had.” Like the elderly care program, goal 
was to keep patients out of hospital, in homes, independent, but for mental health, 
and a community support program. “And that was like everything perfect under 
one roof—and I still feel that way.” 
0.35.27 
On the value of keeping patients in home and independent: “Going into the 
hospital is scary—for everybody. It’s destabilizing … It’s financially hard on 
everybody … The meds might change, and it may or may not be the right thing.” 
Goal of interviewee’s current position is to keep patient stable, so they don’t have 
to go into hospital: “There’s a societal cost when they have to go into the hospital. 
Because this is a population that has no insurance—county, state, and federal are 
paying for their needs.” Feels that patients also don’t like being in hospital. Goal 
in CSP [community support program] is to stay on meds and stay stable so that 
patient doesn’t have to go to hospital. Highly individualized care, working out 
plan so that patient doesn’t have to go to hospital—including evening and 
weekend care. After six months of successfully following plan, might allow 
patient a day off plan, with full independence. “And it’s amazing what a 
community this creates—it’s really a wonderful thing to see. The nurses in a 
program like this are integral to making the med plan work. We also work very 
closely with the med providers … It’s seamless, it’s a beautiful machine when it’s 
working right.” 
0.38.56 
Mostly an out-patient program, keeping people in their homes. On a typical day: 
“Every day is a meeting—an hour meeting. In that hour meeting, every person is 
quick reviewed—if they have a contact that day, if they have an appointment, 
does the contact include medication. The nurse’s part of that, the nurse has to 
make sure the meds are ready, and if they have an appointment, who it’s with and 
how they’re going to get there, and what the point of the appointment is … That 
takes about an hour every morning. What’s great about it is if there’s an 
emergency, like if we got a message the night before, it’s discussed at that 
morning meeting and we can act on it then and there. There’s always a plan of 
action, and that’s what I like it.” 
0.40.25 
Example of an emergency: Someone might call the emergency department in-
house, and report feeling sick and having lost all their meds. In that case, might 
contact the pharmacy and figure out a plan of action. 
0.41.12 
Nurses in CSP have a whole room of meds and give injections. Part of role is 
coordinating large number of patients and provision of meds. Perform various 
checks on patients. And a constant communication line with the case managers. 
“Again, communication is vital to success.” 
0.42.12 
On different roles in healthcare: “When I first started, I heard the word ‘team’ all 
the time, and I was like, ‘OK, ‘team’’. But it took me two to three years to really 
see the flow.” Thinks an important part is sending emails to let everyone relevant 
Page 6 of 8 
 
know what’s happening with a particular client. Role of front-line staff is very 
important, keeping rest of team updated on when patient comes in and what 
background things might be going on with a patient. Case managers write care 
plans; nurses provide support for this process. A large number of meetings during 
the week. 
0.44.35 
On care plans: “A care plan is developed and signed by the whole care team, 
including the consumer, where goals are set—short term, long term—like ‘I want 
to get my own home and move out of the care home.’ You set short term goals to 
help … Everything is recovery-focused to try to help the person attain some of 
their dreams, like to return to school. They can be some amazing goals. 
Sometimes the consumers have a hard time thinking of goals, so we help them 
with that—sometimes as simple as … self-care. These are reviewed every six 
months, and everybody chimes in with what they think, including the nurses. And 
then signed off by the entire team … It’s very thorough, I think.” 
0.46.31 
On success stories: “I was telling someone today … that the littlest baby steps are 
actually mountains, like someone checking their blood sugars who struggled for 
months and months and now they’re doing it daily. The little things in life really 
count, taking a shower. I see it every day. You know, wow. But then you see the 
opposite, when a patient wants their dose reduced on a medication. So, we reduce 
the dose … and within a month or two, you really see a decline in function, where 
they’re not cleaning themselves or eating … And so, you develop that comfort 
level in learning to talk to them about it. There might be some resistance, but 
since you have this therapeutic relationship, you develop a comfort in talking 
about these difficult things that might take a while. But you just keep at it.” 
0.48.45 
Feels that documentation on hygiene, presentation, eye contact, paranoia, changes 
in body movement or eye contact helps with this process, as well as robust 
therapeutic relationships. 
0.49.40 
On mentoring new employees: “One thing I’ve noticed is when we get nurses 
who’ve worked in-patient or in a hospital setting, they still have their nurse’s cap 
on. And hospital nursing is very different from CSP nursing … It’s a different 
flow … In a hospital setting, you have to get so much done in a certain amount of 
time, and you are whipping through that stuff, and your goal is to be done in this 
amount of time. But in our setting, you are grasping information from so many 
different places, including the consumer, and you can’t rush things. You can’t 
rush the consumer. Because the information you’re gathering, you’re passing on 
to others. And you have to appreciate all the information you’re obtaining, not 
just what you’re getting … I think that’s the hardest thing for new employees to 
understand.” 
0.51.18 
In the common med room, you meet nurses from other settings. Feels that this is a 
humbling experience, given how different all these roles are. “These are different 
challenges. These are people coming off the street. You’re not on a locked unit. 
They can leave without taking their meds … But it’s a different kind of 
relationship, is really what I’m trying to say.” 
0.52.28 
“Today I saw a consumer I’ve known for 14 years, and we were ‘Guess how long 
we’ve known each other.’ And she got the biggest smile and asked me about my 
knitting—she remember I like to knit. And I was so touched—you just develop 
Page 7 of 8 
 
this very nice relationship. But I also know it’s a professional relationship—I’m 
her community health nurse. I’m there to support her. I support and I provide. 
And sometimes you have to tell people difficult things.” 
0.53.41 
On doing this kind of work in a small town: “It happens a lot … Over time, I’ve 
just developed a comfort level. They don’t acknowledge me, and I don’t 
acknowledge them. A few times, I’ve seen someone nod and I nod. But I would 
never strike up a conversation.” Even with past clients, would still hesitate to 
strike up conversation. 
0.55.01 
On ‘client’ vs ‘patient’ vs ‘consumer’: This nomenclature in debate at the moment 
and varies from institution to institution. “I think it’s because we’re supposed to 
see ourselves as a resource that consumers are using. That’s how I was told … I 
think if we consider ourselves a resource, it’s more of an open thing, that we’re 
open to them.” 
0.56.26 
On changes in the mental health field: “I do kind of sense that computerized 
documentation has changed how nursing is done, and I’ve talked to other nurses 
who feel the same way. And it’s a checklist, and you’re checking down things. 
It’s not like that where I am now, but it’s definitely that way in a hospital setting. 
You do have an area where you can put in a narrative, but that doesn’t mean it’ll 
necessarily be read. And people are so rushed—literally rushed—that what you 
would put in a narrative might not be the best of information. They say, ‘Well, I 
put it in the boxes I clicked.’ But I’m happy to say that where I work, we can do 
narrative notes. And I hope it stays that way because I think that’s the best way to 
give individualized care.” 
0.57.46 
On the benefits of narrative notes: “You can do better description of presentation, 
responses to medications or therapies, better describe what the person is going 
through symptom-wise. I think that’s just key to providing care. You know, and 
computerized charting is linked to reimbursement. So, we need those check 
boxes. We do need some. But it’s nice to provide some personal narrative.” 
Thinks state-run status doesn’t make a decisive difference on documentation 
required; more largely depends on kind of program patient is in. 
0.59.34 
Sometimes, status of patient’s funding means a potential for error: different 
billing codes have to be entered. “And sometimes you would just like to spend 
more time talking to each consumer, but you make the most of it.” Still not 
enough time for this, even in out-patient setting. 
1.00.47 
“I was going to say I feel very fortunate to work where I’m currently working. 
And I wish all states, all cities, all counties could have a program like ours. 
Because we provide care to every—except for acute in-patient, we provide so 
many levels of care. And people can move through the program to meet their 
needs. And when I’ve worked at other places … we did not have this level of 
seamless under one roof. That’s what makes it wonderful.” 
1.01.51 
Feels that program developed because of having school of sociology and some 
forward-thinking people there. “It’s absolutely heart-breaking to see people [who 
did not have follow-up psychiatric care … We need continuity of care and 
coordination of care. And not all communities have that, and it’s very, very tragic, 
the results. People go off their meds, and they spiral downhill and they don’t get 
to the doctor. That’s why I’m very proud of where we work.”
