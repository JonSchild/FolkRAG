HORSESHOES. 
Written by Jerry Cohan expressly for Billy Carter, and 
sung by him with great success. 
Copyrighted by A. J. Fisher, 1880. 
Since horseshoes are in fashion why a 
horseshoe song I'll 
sing, 
Its the latest superstition, the most fashionable thing, 
But the only ones 'cept horses who wear them as a 
rule, 
To do them any good must be the jackass or the mule. 
The ladies wear the horseshoe on their fingers,ears and hair, 
The men wear horseshoe pins and canes, it's horseshoe 
everywhere, 
They hang them on the masts at sea to keep away the gales, 
There's horseshoe clocks and bootjacks, horseshoe tracks 
and horseshoe nails. 
They put a 
horseshoe at the gate to keep the witches out, 
Thin people carry a 
horseshoe for luck to make 'em stout, 
And fat folks keep the horseshoe for luck to make them thin 
Yet the bummer sells the horseshoe to the junkman to get 
gin, 
The gambler carries the horseshoe his victim for to skin, 
And the victim carries a 
horseshoe to take the gambler in, 
The fisherman carries a 
horseshoe to help him make a 
haul, 
And if he catches only horseshoe fish he has no luck at all. 
They bake the bread in horseshoe pans, and mould the 
butter, too. 
They nail the horseshoe in the trunk to make the old 
clothes new, 
They hang 'ern on the church door and for good luck to 
'em pray, 
And the preacher carries a 
horseshoe to keep the girls away 
The temperance man he carries it to protect him from the 
rum, 
And in hopes he may keep always drunk it's treasured by 
the bum, 
If you want to see a 
horseshoe fly just tickle a 
mule and 
get struck. 
I've sung myself quite horse shoe see, so I'll wish you all 
good luck,

The Poor Serio-Comio, 
Words by John McVeigh. 
To my friend Wm. Carter, and sung by him with great 
success. 
Oh ! the titles of songs of late are so used 
That it's hard a 
new one to find, 
But I've hit one at last and I 
think 't 
will please, 
So carefully hear it in mind. 
" 
Remember the poor," " You've children of your own," 
I'll admit to be very good logic, 
But the title I've given to the one I'll now sing, 
Is " Pity the poor serio-comic." 
CHORUS. 
See how she struggles with music and words, 
She acts like a 
colt on a 
frolic, 
She yells and she screeches then gets out of key, 
So pity the poor serio-comic. 
About six months ago, a 
mechanic she was, 
In a 
hotel at the corner of the street, 
Till she formed the acquaintance of a 
bad actor so gay, 
Who tol d 
her she was charming and neat, 
htu

THE POOR SERIO COMIC.—Continued. 
He put her on the stage with about a 
dozon more, 
And they say now that she takes a 
tonic, 
But she isn't to blame—sure she's working for fame, 
So pity the poor serio-comic. 
CHORUS. 
Then help her along to the jail if you can, 
And her discords put to an end, 
Treat her with kindness, then slug her with bucks, 
And prove your the dizzy's best friend. 
Nov; these poor serio-comics oft have nothing to wear, 
Except arses that cost a 
hundred or two, 
And I'm sure that's enourf, and I'll know you'll admit, 
To make any poor creature feel blue. 
Oh, they get by the week ten dollars or so, 
Which makes them feel badly and chronic; 
Vet they wear diamond rings that would swell a 
man's 
head, 
Those poor dizzy serio-comics'. 
CHORUS. 
Then always extend to them your hand or your foot, 
In kindness to them never lack, 
For the poor serio-comic don't know what she does, 
Let her alone and she'll surely come back. 
Written and sung by Billy Carter with great suess 
You can talk of ugly babies, 
On oar block it is a 
sight, 
To see a 
thousand babies cliaw 
And claw with all their might. 
There is pug-nosed babies, goggle-eyed kids, 
And some of the good old stock, 
It's a 
regular menagerie, 
The babies on the block. 
Mrs. Grady's got a 
baby 
That talked before /was born, 
Another by the name of Simpson, 
With a 
nose like a 
Wm. goat's horn; 
They'll get squalling and bawling, 
And they'd gather in a 
flock, 
Barnum ought to make a 
call 
On the babies on our block. 
CHORUS. 
Little Johnny Toothpick 
And Susan Turpentine, 
A 
crying and a 
fighting, 
And a 
singing Baby Mine; 
They'd take the chromo cake and all 
For smashing Grandpa's clock, 
They'd win the prize for swallowing flies, 
These babies on our block.

PARODY ON BABIES ON OUR BLOCK.—CoNTINuED. 
There's an Italian kid just two years old, 
With eyes in the back of his head, 
You can guess how the daddy feels 
When the young one's hair is red; 
8onie have got no eyes, and some have got no nose, 
And a 
black and tan kid 
With an elephant hoof 
And forty-'leven toes; 
Some's dramatic, some's lunatic, 
One kid has a 
wooden ear, 
Another one, they call Napoleon, 
Drinks hts-barrel of lager beer. 
They'll rear and tare, 
And pull their hair, 
Until your nerves they shock, 
They'll scream and yell, 
And raise old fun, 
The babies on our block. 
CHORUS. 
Little Sally Falseteeth, 
Sitting in a 
custard pie, 
A 
crying 'cause her little brother 
Slugged her in the eye. 
Rise, Sally, rise, knock his eye out with a 
rock, 
For there's a 
hundred times more babies 
Than there's daddies on our block. 
Grandmother Pratt's Wonderful Cat. 
Written by Billy Carter, and sang by him with great success. 
Old Grandmother Pi att owned a 
fine Thomas cat, 
A 
beautiful sky-blue Maltese, 
And this wonderful cat often went on a 
bat, t 
A 
tearing, high old jamboree. 
I'm going to show that this cat wasn't slow— 
He was ringboned in one of his eyes— 
One day he did go down to Stetson's cat show, 
And he drew out a 
golden first prize. 
This wonderful cat he was hairy and fat, 
One ear was chewed off in a 
row, 
And his nose was as flat as the crown of my hat, 
It hapyened I 
can't tell you how. 
He was heavy and strong. but his tail wasn't long, 
It was ate off all but a 
short stump, 
And I 
hope it ain't wrong for to tell in my song, 
On his back was a 
three-cornered hump. 
He could sing like a 
lark, every night after dark 
lie would get onto my back-yard fence. 
My watch-dog would bark like a 
man eating shark, 
When this cat his sweet song would commence. 
In a 
moment the ground would be covered all round 
With cats from the neighboring streets, 
Not a 
c 
it could he found that dared utter a 
sound, 
But they'd quietly sit in their seats. 
Ahout midnight one night he got into a 
fight— 
Ile was fond of disturbing the peace— 
Through the dimness of sight of the eye on his right 
He fell into a 
pan of soap-grease. 
Ile squeled like the deuce, but it wasn't no use, 
He couldn't get out of the pan, 
- 
The grease held him fast, he died game to the last, 
As only a 
Thomas cat can. 
Parody on Full Moons. 
Written by Edwin Talbot, and sang with great success by 
Billy Carter. 
The noble order of Ancient Bums, 
That ain't got any stamps, 
Are trying to form a 
No-work Club 
With the always-idle tramps. 
They sit in overy public park, 
• 
Or lay upon the grass, 
And beg a 
chew of tobacco, boys, 
From any one who'l pass. 
The first to eat, the first to drink, 
Then march down Broadway, 
They pick up stumps and work the pumps, 
They're the terrors of the day. 
CHORUS. 
When the little tramps are begging, 
They say they never begged before, 
They'll sleep in a 
cart or some alley, 
And beg at every basement, basement door. 
They take the road the 1st of may, 
Put lightning on their heels, 
And steal the farmers chickens and corn 
If they don't get three square meals; 
Beat every freight train in the land, 
When they're catched they make 'em sick, 
And when snow falls upon the ground 
To the city double quick. 
The first to eat, the first to drink, 
They're as quiet as a 
mouse when asking 
The Captain of Police for to sleep in the Station House. 
Chorus.

Things Have Changed Since Hannah Died, 
Written and sung by Billy Carter. 
Hannah was a 
lovely creature, 
Long of foot and short of neck, 
Her voice was her most prominent feature, 
Before she handed in her checks. 
She hock'd my clothes to elope with a 
fellow, 
I 
contemplated suicide, 
But I 
changed my mind • nd moved in a 
cellar, 
For things have changed since Hannah died. 
Doctor Tanner is a 
fast liver, 
But his liver lasted longer than him, 
If the Brooklyn bridge is finished ever, 
You can save two cents, and needn't swim. 
H. W. B. says he can't he:p loving her, 
But Theodore is Elysabeth's pride, 
Beecher won't pull down the blinds in Heaven, 
Foa he'll find 
That things have changed since Hannah died. 
Sammy Tilden was elected, 
But Rutheford he did grab the ground, 
Boss Tweed left us unexpected, 
And S—ts 
stiff it can't be found. 
Some says Hancock will be elected, 
Others that Garfield will get inside 
The White House walls, if he expects it 
.He'll find 
That things have changed since Hannah died.

CURIOUS FAMILY, 
. 
written by Dockstader and sung by Billy Carter with 
great success. 
I 
know a 
family that lives here around, 
The most curious family that lives in the town, 
Some are deformed, disfigured, Ill-shaped 
Bow-kneed, knock-legged and faces like apes, 
CHORUS. 
There's Margaret and Hanna, 
Aileen, Allanna, 
Richard and Pritchard, and Siftsand Sal Sue, 
Mickey and Wickey, 
John James and Jackey. 
Silly and Billy and Snicklefoot Sue. 
Cornheeled William and Bigfooted Sue. 
Captured the Jim-Jams from Flewy-come-Flew, 
Orr Hays bought a 
pack mule 
And Pat tried to buy it, 
But he got stabbed in the back 
By the bold Tim O'Risk. 
CHORUS. 
Mike married a 
hat rack. 
Pat stole a 
car track. 
Mike pawned a 
smoke stack, shot a 
dog with a 
plow, 
Bought specs for carpet tacks, put a 
door crack in a 
grip 
sack, 
John James married a 
boot jack, with warts on its brow. 
The Order of Old BUM 
Written by Jerry Cohan and sung with great success by 
Billy Carter. 
The secret order of old bums, for gall will take the cake, 
They recognize the pass word, it's " What'll you have to 
take ?" 
We likes to drink, we likes to eat, and don't waste drops 
or crumbs, 
Cops and rounders all are on to the order of old bums. 
CHORUS. 
The first degree—charge it to me—then your eye you 
wink, 
The bottle tip, the glass you grip—password—What d'ye 
drink ? 
For the back of your neck and the seat of your pants, 
The landlord gently comes, 
And lands you on the sidewalk in the order of old bums. 
When the little cop is staying, in some door way for a 
snooze. 
The " Bums" are on the war-path laying, 
For a 
lunch, a 
grasshopper, or booze, booze, booze. 
The watermelon season for a 
change will sometimes suit, 
And when we can't get soft shell crabs why then we'll 
tackle fruit. 
We work the bar for all it's worth till the landlord for us 
comes, 
We furnish politicians from the order of old bums. 
FIRST DEGREE SET TO, 
In the spring time and the summer, 
To the green fields and hen roosts off we goes, 
But in the winter the poor bummer, 
Must hustle in the jail for feed and clothes. I 
suppose. 
SECOND DEGREE SET TO. 
The object of this order is to walk when we can't ride, 
And fill ourselves with lager from the empty keg outside, 
'We smoke the best Havana buts, and share 'em with our 
churns. 
And an unprotected clothesline is a Christmas for the 
bums. 
THIRD DEGREE SET TO. 
At election time it is our oyster— 
To the polls we gently, gently stray, 
And of schooners the bum is then a 
hoister, 
As he samples with the keg election day. 
What d'ye say.

sweet Camille. 
Written by Jerry Coburn. 
Sung with great success by 
Billy Carter. 
In the back line of the...ballet, 
Where I 
first met sweet Camille, 
As she tipped the light fantastic sweet and gay; 
And evening after evening 
I 
watched her skip along; 
One night I 
flipped by charmer a 
bouquet, 
And in it was a 
letter 
All scented up with mush, 
Requesting that she'd grant an interview. 
She said that she would meet me 
Some evening afar dusk; 
So I 
went and ordered beer and feed for two. 
CHORUS. 
She had an appetite 
That was a 
daisy; 
She was hungry, she was dry, 
And I 
couldn't say 
Where she ever put away, 
Or where she stowed the oysters, beer and pie. 
So when the show was over, 
She took me to her house, 
A brown-stone front up in an alley-way 
She sat me in the parlor, 
And I 
heard her tell her ma, 
She'd caught another sardine sucker meaning me, 
When she washed with soap and water 
The powder born !rier face, 
t 
15 
SWEET CAMILLE—CorrINUE 
D. 
Her complexion was the color of ripe corn, 
And the wrinkles on her bald head 
I 
easily could trace, 
When her pretty brunette wig and crimps were gone, 
CHORUS. 
She was pigeon-toed, 
She was lap-eared, 
She's a 
corker, she's a 
plum, 
When she had off her pad, 
All the frame she ever had 
Wouldn't cast a 
clothes-pole shadow in the sun. 
She put on her greasy wrapper, 
And by my side she sat, 
She asked me if I 
wouldn't treat to beer. 
I 
thought a 
dose of onions 
Would much improve her breath, 
For the flavor was so fierce when she was near. 
I 
gave my love a 
quarter. 
She bounded for a 
saloon, 
By the window I 
made my escape, 
I 
won't go near the show shop 
Where Camile is any more, 
For another dose of that would kill me dead. 
CHORUS. 
She's my epicac. 
She's an emetic, 
And her number eleven foot would fill a 
room, 
And when she perspired, 
She was very much admired, 
As a 
standing advertisement for perfume.

THE BABY SHOW. 
Sang by Bill Carter. 
I 
went to see the Baby Show, it was a 
funny sight 
To see a 
thousand babies chaw and claw with all their might. 
They were big- nosed babies, pug-nosed babies, in calico and 
silk, 
And the overseer kept them still with a 
club and a 
bowl of 
milk. 
They'd holler for their dear mamma's, and chew each other's 
ears, 
One bolder than the rest got up and sung out for a 
beer. 
They were pug nosed-babies, broken-nose kids everywhere 
you'd go, 
And they were all willilng to take the prize away from the 
Baby Show. 
CHORUS. 
There was Master William Snodgrass, 
And Matilda Turbentine, 
Chewing sticks of licorice 
And singing Baby Mine. 
They yelled and roared in chorus, 
When their Ma would go, 
There was operas from the Pinafore 
At the great big B 
Lb/ Show 
A 
baby only two weeks old 
Was scolding at his mother; 
Anoher was smoking a 
meerschaum pipe 
Playing poker with his brother. 
THEBABY SHOW.—CONTINVED. 
The cross eyed baby took a 
fit, 
And yelled for sasaparilla. 
His mother grabbed a 
policeman's club, 
And smashed him in the smeller. 
The baby with the split hair lip, 
Got up to raise a 
fight; 
He fell through a 
knot hole in thefloor, 
And went clear out of sight. 
The base ball baby struck the base, 
With a 
monstrous piece of dough 
That started up a 
fearful fight 
At the great big baby show. 
Chorus. 
Mrs. Smith she then got up 
And said to Mrs. Jones, 
That her baby was a 
thin, had 
Looking, dizzy chunk of bones. 
Mrs. Smith told Mrs. Jones she lied, 
And grabbed her by the hair, 
Knockcd all her false teeth down her throat, 
And slung her down the stair.. 
A 
two-months-old took a 
chew of tobacco, 
And spit upon the floor, 
The committee men they saw him, 
And fired him through the door. 
A 
slightly boozy infant said, 
That he would like to know, 
Why they couldn't start a 
walking match 
At the great big Baby Show. 
Chorus.

MAN FROM COHOES. 
Sung by Billy Carter 
I'll sing of a 
gallant young man, 
Who was born in the town of Cohoes, 
His head was fiat as a 
bedstead slat, 
And lie always wore hen-skin shoes. 
His neck was covered with scars, 
He had freckles all over his tongue, 
His nose was hooked, his legs were crooked, 
And he look'd like a 
tramp or a 
bum. 
CHORUS. 
But he caught the croup 
While eating soup, 
And they thought he was a 
goner, 
He got sorel.eyes, 
From looking- at pies 
In a 
grocery 'round the corner. 
He had a 
face like a 
Texas steer, 
Eyes like a 
soft-shell crab, 
He had the glanders, 
MAN PROM COHOES.—COgTINDEI3. 
And yellow janders, 
Till they thought he would go mad. 
His head was as big as a 
drum, 
He was tongue-tied in his feet, 
He fell through a 
hall, 
And lit on his gall, 
And landed way out in the street. 
He'd a 
big wart on his ear, 
And a 
cancer on his back, 
While shovelling fog 
He was bit by a 
dog, 
And they pack'd him home in a 
sRP.k. 
CHORUS. 
But his mouth got twisted, 
From eating biscuit, 
And his lungs turned inaide out, 
His eye-balls grew 
on the back of his neck, 
And his teeth they all fell out. 
When he'd walk the street, 
His back would squeak, 
And he always had the blues, 
He was long and thin, 
Like a 
piece of tin, 
This man that was born in Cohoeo.

Widow Du.nii (Parody); 
21 
WIDOW DUNN (PARODY).—CONTINIIRD. 
Sung by Billy Carter. 
Dedicated to Harrington and Hart. 
I 
know a 
big fat widow, 
That keeps a 
livery stable, 
A 
making beds for horses that are sick, 
She's an awful early riser, 
And a 
champion appetizer, 
Like an eight-day clock 
She goes around on tick. 
She's from the country poor-house, 
Her husband was a 
tramp, 
In the English army he did beat a 
drum, 
And for singing tar-heeled Hanna's, 
Or murdering sick pianos, 
There's no marker for the big fat Widow Dunn. 
CHORUS. 
She is hunky, she is chunky, 
She's as handsome as a 
monkey, 
She's a 
fairy, she's contrary, 
She's a 
lamb, T. mean a 
ham, 
She's as tall as any ladder, 
I'd slug her if I 
had her, 
And kick the chest protector off the Widow Dunn. 
She steals the morning papers 
Away from every door, 
She's an acrobactic, break-neck son of a 
gun, 
And at every wake or funeral, 
She goes to sing and dance, 
Such a 
tender creature is the widow Dunn. 
She's freckled, but she's pretty, 
And well developed feet, 
She has one back tooth that weighs a 
half a 
ton, 
And at every passing stranger 
She fires an ancient egg, 
So familiar is the Widow Dunn. 
CHORUS. 
She is moody, she is sankey, 
She's consumptive, she is crankey, 
She's rheumatic, she's lunatic, 
She's a 
bum, she weighs a 
ton, 
She is crazy, she is careless, 
She is toothless, she is hairless, 
Such a 
chromo is the big fat Widow Dunn.

WICKED YOUNG SALL. 
(Continued.) 
Cnonus. 
Wicked Young Sall. 
Originally sung by BILLY CARTER. 
Come listen awhile to me, 
And I'll tell you a 
story strange, 
Of a 
wicked young gal and her front name was Sall, 
And she's driven me crazy deranged. 
We first met in the street, 
She trampled on my feet, 
She apologized genteely, 
And I 
thought that she was sweet, 
But qhortly I 
discovered she was full of vile deceit, 
CHORUS. 
She has gone to fight the Indians, 
She went West with Texas Jack, 
I 
bought her a 
Thomas J. H. Hawk, 
And I 
hope she won't come back, 
She raised the riot and the R. R. strike, 
And the Russian war did start, 
She's head one of the Excise law, 
Farewell, good-bye, sweetheart. 
She sang a 
little song 
As her arm I 
took in mine, 
'Twas silver threads among the gold, 
I 
thought her voice was fine. 
I've changed my mind since then, 
I 
think it was very coarse, 
Like the captain of the canal scow, 
it was husky, base and coarse, 
And every time I 
think of it, 
It sounds nine times worse. 
She's gone to he an angel, 
Pushing clouds up in the skies, 
If she gets up to that happy land 
I 
never want to die. 
If she arrives on that bright shore, 
There'll be a 
commotion sure, 
She'll raise a 
fuss and a 
terrible muss 
On that Hallelujah shore. 
She took me to her home 
And her mother fired me out, 
With a 
club she fumbled away in my hair, 
And loudly for help did shout, 
She bruised me up most fearfully, 
Nine fat policemen came, 
They dragged me to the station house, 
And nine months I 
did remain, 
They beat and bruised my character, 
And tarnished my good name. 
23 
CHORUS. 
She swore that I 
was Gen. Grant, 
From Europe in disguise, 
A 
General from the Russian ranks, 
Or one of the Turkish spies, 
She swore I 
was loaded with dynamite or nitro-
glycerine, 
She starts away next Thursday night 
To fight the English Queen.

Diabolical Story. 
Originally sung by BILLY CARTER. 
If you'll listen with your ears 
For a 
couple of minion years, 
A. diabolical story I 
will tell, 
It's about a 
female girl 
With red teeth and curly hair, 
And I 
loved her till my head began to swell. 
Her name was Susan Glue, 
And the grub she used to chew, 
She was a 
night clerk in a 
foundry over town, 
She'd an alabaster claw, 
And a 
double-breasted jaw, 
And every bunion on her feet weighed a 
pound. 
One day she gave me the shake, 
And I 
thought my heart would break 
When I 
heard she was playing Hamlet on the stage, 
She stole eleven or twee ty dollars. 
And a 
lot of paper collars, 
And eloped with a 
bummer twice her age. 
As a 
singer she is vile, 
And she hasn't got no style, 
And they'll kill her if she ever tries to dance, 
Oh, she stole my summer clothes, 
And I 
was nearly froze, 
And her bummer wears my bran new Sunday pants. 
If I 
ever meet her feller, 
I 
will bust him in the smeller, 
I 
am certain he will fill an early grave, 
I 
will split his ugly tongue, 
And I'll kick him in the lung, 
With an Indian club his whiskers I 
will shave. 
I 
will sling a 
bottle of ink 
And destroy Miss Susan Glue, 
And gently drop her in the nearest sewer, 
I 
will drink a 
kidney stew, 
And I'll skip to Kalamazoo, 
For Jimmy Fresh he never went back on the poor.

BILLY GARTER'S PARODY OF YOU AND 1. 
Originally sung by VIRGINIA STIGENRY. 
We met and we flirted, you and I, 
In a 
beer garden not long ago, 
And oh we were happy you and I, 
As the lager down our throats did flow, 
We threw two glasses, you and I, 
In the gutter as it glided on, 
While the Dutchman sadly us did eye, 
And the waiters as they slowly passed along; 
And oh we were broke then you and I, 
And felt that our life's pleasant dream, 
Must end, for the police very soon 
Would find out what dead beats we had been. 
We sat in the parlor, you and I, 
And married six months we had been, 
I 
thought we'd be happy, you and I, 
But soon found out that I'd been taken in, 
We fought like two cats then, you and I, 
And my hair, oh how tightly you hung on, 
You then hauled off and blacked ray eye, [corm 
While my nose looked like a 
half ehawed ear of 
And oh we were noisy, you and I, 
As I 
woke from a 
once pleasant dream, 
And felt that instead of one we're swei, 
As its you now, for .
1" nowhere am seen. 
Billy Carter's Duck Foot Sue. 
Originally sung by him with great success. 
Just keep your seats awhile, 
And I 
will tell to you 
Of the love I 
used to feel 
For a 
gal named Duck Foot Sue. 
She was gentle and divine, 
Long waisted in the feet, 
Her heel stuck out behind 
Like an eighteen karat beat. 
CHORUS. 
SO 
now I'll tell to you 
Of the gal I 
loved so true, 
She was second hand mate in a 
Chinese laundry 
Out in Kalamazoo. 
Her beauty was all that she had, 
She was built like a 
North river shad, 
She'd an india rubber lip 
Like the rudder of a 
ship, 
With a 
razor she was bad. 
She wasn't very fat, 
Or either was she thin, 
She looked when she was dressed 
Like a 
straw in a 
barrel of gin. 
I 
took her to the ball 
Of the Hardly Able Club, 
It cost a 
ten case note 
For to fill her up with grub. 
BILLY CARTERS DUCK FOOT SUE. 
(Continued.) 
CHORUS. 
She'd an eye like a 
hard shell clam, 
And a 
voice like a 
catamaran, 
She could chin for an hour 
At a 
forty-horse power, 
And an ear like a 
Japanese fan, 
Her hair was an indigo blue, 
She was graceful as a 
kangaroo, 
You ought to hear a 
rustle 
With her patent rubber bustle, 
She could whistle like a 
steamboat too. 
But since she ran away, 
I've almost lost my breath, 
If she travels on her shape, 
She's sure to starve to death. 
If I 
had married her 
I'd almost been afraid 
Of being shot or scalped 
By the mother-in-law brigade. 
CHORUS. 
For she was a 
funny old guy, 
With a 
double-barreled squint in her eye, 
her number ten feet 
Used to cover up the street, 
She'd a 
mouth like a 
crack in a 
pie, 
She'd a 
cheerful cemetery laugh 
And a 
head like a 
Mexican calf, 
She's an iron clad clipper built gun boat brig, 
With a 
feather on her maintop gaff.

Thousand Quarter Hours. 
Originally sung by BILLY CARTEn. 
You see before you a 
married man, 
You can tell that by my looks, - 
For the last two years I've spent my time 
In dodging plates and books. 
My wife is a 
female Samson, 
As a 
boxer she beats the deck, 
She fought a 
hundred rounds under water 
With a 
grindstone around her neck. 
For she juggles light and heavy weights, 
From midnight until morn, 
I 
never saw such muscle, 
Since the hour that I 
was born. 
She won't eat anything else but gravel 
And water mixed with flour, 
For she's training to walk a 
thousand miles 
In a 
thousand quarter 'lours. 
The house looks like a 
race track, 
She's given me the blues, 
For she's walking in there from morn till night, 
And wearing out all my shoes. 
She hasn't slept for thirteen weeks, 
Her feet are tied up in a 
sack, 
She says she'll beat Mme. Anderson's time, 
Or perish on the track.

THOUSAND QUARTER HOURS. 
(Continued.) 
Oh, the room is only six by nine, 
A 
little out of style, 
She has to make a 
million laps 
Before she makes a 
mile. 
The kids are yelling for soothing syrup, 
And howling with all their power, 
While their ma is walking a 
thousand miles 
In a 
thousand quarter hours. 
Her feet are like two pumpkins, 
This pedestrian baby mine, 
She's kept me awake the last two weeks 
A 
marking down her time. 
She has fifty warts on the back of llor neck, 
She's blind and cannot see, 
If she wins I'll give her a 
chrome 
And a 
club and a 
pound of tea. 
But I 
hope she comes in way behind, 
I 
hope she will get beat, 
For she races every fire engine 
She meets upon the street. 
She wanted to match O'Leary to walk 
For a 
keg of Italian flour, 
But he advised her to bed to soak her head 
Vor D. thousand million hours, 
Yellow Clarionette. 
Originally aung by BILLY CA.RTEIS. 
I'll sing to you some woes of mine,_ 
About a 
gal so fair, 
With a 
hump-backed bunion on her nose; 
And brick bat colored hair. 
loved her as I 
love my life, 
And she was gay you bet, 
But a 
Dutchman used to play for her 
On a 
yellow clarionette. 
CHORUS. 
He said he loved her much, 
And spoke Italian Dutch, 
And every time I 
caught him there, 
You bet I 
made him dust, dust, dust. 
He played for her night and day, 
And murdered Old Dog Tray, 
And paralyzed the people for 
Ten thousand miles away. 
Clothilda was the maiden fair, 
And Fritz the Dutchman bold, 
He told her of his bully home 
And of his wealth untold. 
Ile played for her one afternoon, 
And got up to K 
flat, 
He blowed the brains out of his head, 
And spoilt his Sunday cravat, 
This caught the maiden dead, 
For it almost turned her head, 
He asked her if she'd go with him, 
They to the parson fled. 
He married her on sight, 
I 
found it out that night, 
I 
drank twelve quarts of oyster soup, 
And went to bed quite tight. 
When I 
came to on the next day, 
I 
thought my heart would break, 
I 
tried to starve myself to death, 
With a 
whortleberry cake. 
I 
grabbed an iron boot jack, 
And I 
tried to cut my throat, 
I 
went alone to a 
beer saloon 
For a 
wooden overcoat. 
CHORII9. 
I 
saw the gal last week, 
And she's got lots of cheek, 
She plays a 
K 
fiat clarionette, 
With that hump-backed freckled beat. 
She says old man don't fret, 
I've got two boys you bet, 
And they are marked down 
To the middle of the nose 
With a 
yellow clarionette. 
WILL IOU, WON'T YOU? 
As sung by LIZZIE BRA.HAM. 
The girls have much to answer for, 
The way in which they tease, - 
And twirl us round their little fingers. 
Do just as they please 
I'm suffering at present, 
From one who's most unkind, 
She keeps me on the " tender hooks," 
And won't make up her mind. 
SPOKEN.—Although for two mortal years have I 
been period. 
ically enquiring— 
°FLORES. 
Will you, won't you, do you, don't you love your cousin Joseph ? 
Can you, can't you, shall you, shan't you tell me so, 
Do you, don't you, will you, won't you smile upon your Joseph? 
Tell me anything you like but don't say " no!" 
Sometimes we go to parties, where 
She's awful good at flirting. 
She says there is no harm in it. 
I 
feel it's awfully " hurting." 
I 
try to read her thoughts, I 
do, 
And watch her every glance, 
And every morning, noon and night, 
Whenever I've the chance. 
Will you, won't you, tr.c. 
She'll let me make her presents—yes! 
And vows I 
make—absurd. 
She listens to my promises, 
But never says a 
word; 
To write her loving letters, I 
Oft sit up half the night. 
Sometimes I 
think I'm doing wrong 
When to her I 
do write. 
SPOKEN.—And after covering and crossing a 
sheet of 
cap—the proper paper for love letters—I 
put a 
P. S.— 
Will, you, won't you, ie.

If she'd only give a 
whisper, 
Or a " teeney " little " yes," 
I'd feel as though in Paradise; 
My fate I 
then could guess; 
In neither words nor ways, alas! 
Her consent can I 
trace, 
And if I 
break my promise, 
There's a 
breach of promise case! 
SPOKEN.—S0 you can see the fix I'm in through— 
Will you, won't you, &c. 
But to test the party's feelings, 
I've bit upon a 
plan, 
I'll go and make the strongest love 
To her younger sister " Fan." 
When damsels are so cool and coy, 
And cruelly demure, 
By Jove I 
fancy jealousy's 
A 
safe and speedy cure.

The Man that Stole the Country. 
Written by FRANK E. 
McNtsx, expressly for M URPHY and 
tsfAcx. 
We'll tell you of a 
terrible thief, 
Who for stealing things could not be beat. 
He'd even steal the grub he'd eat, 
The man that stole the country. 
In his sleep he'd dream of what he'd done, 
And when he'd awake, the son of a 
gun, 
He'd get up and go out and steal for fun, 
The man that stole the country. 
CHORUS. 
He stole a 
horse, he stole a 
cow, 
A 
stack of hay and a 
cast-iron plow. 
He swiped a 
dog most dead with old age, 
A 
whole row of footlights off from a 
stage. 
Last night he came in this very place, 
And took the nose right off a 
man's face. 
All kinds of fish, from a 
whale to a 
perch, 
Even the steeple of Trinity Church. 
A 
pile of timber, a 
liberty pole, 
Stewart's body he must have stole. 
He was bred of a 
family of very bad rank, 
He stole all the bonds in Manhattan Bank. 
The Elevated Road he would have got 
If it hadn't been riveted to the spot. 
He'd steal the tongue out of your mouth 
While you would be talking; 
He stole the shoes off O'Leary 
While he was a 
walking. 
He stole a 
mule that was dying with cramps, 
Then went out West and collared all tramps; 
Into a 
shop and sneaked out the boss, 
Over to Philadelphia and nipped Charlie Ross. 
In Gilmore's Garden he collared the track, 
He even tried to steal Murphy and Mack,

THE MAN THAT STOLE THE COUNTRY. 
Continued. 
And still he wasn't satisfied— 
The man that stole the country. 
To Blackwell's Island he was sent, 
And life- Lime given to repent 
For things he'd done with bad intent--
The man that stole the country. 
But the villain he was very bold, 
And prison walls could not him hold, 
And he's around again, so we're told— 
The man that stole the country. 
CHORUS. 
A 
pair of boots a 
tub, and a 
saw, 
The wonderful man with the cast-iron jaw. 
A 
full brass band, and a 
new piano, 
The ballot boxes in Louisiana. 
President Hayes' ulster and beaver, 
Went to New Orleans and took the fever; 
Came to New York to steal Hell Gate, 
And he'd had it, too, if he hadn't been late. 
He stole a 
whole gang that were out on a 
la-k, 
If he hadn't been watched he'd had Central Park, 
Stole a 
street car, the driver and all, 
Then went up and took Tammany Hall. 
Took a 
cop right off from his beat, 
Stole all the bears there were in Wall street. 
To steal the City Hall he often did wish, 
He took the false teeth away from McNish. 
He stole a 
house they had just finished building. 
Took Bessie Turner from Theodore Tilton. 
Into a 
school and nipped the teacher, 
He'd had Elizabeth, too, if it wasn't for Beecher. 
Stole some young folks that were _playing backgammon. 
W ,mt to the London and stole Murphy and Shannon. 
And still he was not satisfied—

The Man that Knew the Actors. 
Written and sung by JoRN McVEIGH. Dedicated to my friend HARRY 
McAvoY. 
Of a 
queer young man I'm going to -tell, 
And every one of you know him well; 
He's rather a 
sort of a 
dizzy swell, 
The man that knew the actors. 
He knew every actor, both east and west, 
The highest, the lowest, the least, the best; 
In fact he would never give you a 
rest, 
The man that knew the actors. 
He knew Frank Girard, Charles White and Pat Rooney; 
When he spoke of Add Ryman he nearly went " looney." 
He knew both the Tonys, Pastor and Hart, 
And said he gave Harrigan his very first start. 
He knew John Wild, Johnny Shay and Bill Gray; 
And he knew Bill Thompson, wrote many a 
play. 
He knew Billy Barry as well as his mother, 
And Frank Bennett to him was as dear as a 
brother; 
Watson and Ellis he knew thoroughly well, 
And he put in the business John and Henry Kernell. 
He knew the Deveres, both Samuel and Billy, 
And he raised Cool Burgess, who knocked the " guys " silly, 
Gus Williams, he said, is a 
great friend of mine, 
" 
He eats nothing but birds, and drinks nothing but wine." 
Lew Simmonds and Richmond are two of his pards, 
And Sanford and Wilson enjoy his regards.

THE MAN THAT KNEW THE ACTORS. 
Continued. 
Billy Emerson and Newcomb are two of his friends, 
And to Schoolcraft and Coes his best wishes extends; 
He knows Hughey Dougherty, and of him spoke well, 
And he lived in the same house with Senator Bell. 
Delehanty and Hengler, Harry Thompson and McKee 
Were many times out with him on a 
good " spree." 
He gave Charley Diamond his first lesson in music, 
And writes all the songs for Bill Morton and Gulick. 
He knows Backus and Wambold, and fat Billy Birch, 
They introduced him to Thatcher one day in a 
church. 
Billy Carter, Jaques, Kruger and himself are quite thick, 
He knows all the Nortons, including one they call Nick; 
Milt Barlow, George Wilson, and West and Primrose, 
Wouldn's lose his good will for a 
million of shows. 
He knows Larry Tooley, Joe Lang, and Ned West, 
And Cummings, and Harrington, his friendship attest. 
He knew Quilter and Goldrich, and old Walter Bray, 
In fact, he knows every actor in the country to-day. 
He knows people that were dead for ninety-nine years, 
And whenever he spoke of them he always shed tears. 
A 
Mick who was listening to him a 
couple of hours, 
Said: "Do you know a 
young man by the name of Ed Powers?" 
He said he did not—and could you suppose 
That the terrier thumped him square on the nose, 
Saying: " Ye're a 
liar," as his ear he did eat, 
And made a 
kick at his neck as he an in the street ; 
And now he knows no actor. 
BANJO SOLO. 
Written by Joini M. TURNER for BILLY CARTER. 
Of a 
very hard case I'm going to cite— 
Diogenes Thump, the sluggerite— 
You can bet he could chew and he could bite, 
For he loved a 
rough and tumble fight. 
He wipped his wife till she fell down dead, 
Then he licked his kids for crying for bread; 
He licked his landlord for charging him rent, 
Then he tore down the house and lived in a 
tent. 
He fought one round with old Joe Goss, 
And knocked him apart, as a 
matter of couse; 
He had a 
mouth like a 
sick giraffe, 
He'd break you in two and bite you in half. 
He &add take you in his mouth like a 
hinge, 
Then squirt you out like a 
big syringe; 
Oh, he was the man you had better avoid, 
He could eat yellow fever and vareloid. 
From a 
lamp-post he would bite a 
chunk, 
Then swallow the gas to make him drunk, 
And though he weighed but forty pounds, 
He licked John Dwyer in seventeen rounds. 
He whipped his grandmother, aged ninety-four, 
And bit out the eye of his mother-in-law— 
For he was a 
terrible man. 
DIOGENES THUMP, 
THE SLUGGERITE. 
Continued. 
Though he was clerk in a 
Sunday school, 
You can bet your life he was no fool, 
He'd read his little bible through, 
And used to go to vespers, too. 
He swallowed a 
pair of Arnheim's pants, 
Then gobbled his sisters, his cousins and his aunts; 
With Jimmy Elliot he swept the floor, 
And chewed up a 
crew of a 
Pinafore. 
He bit off the head of Dick Dead-eye, 
And washed it down with a 
gallon of rye. 
He swam with Boynton to Manhattan Beach, 
And licked all the Jews that came in his reach; 
He cleaned out the bar of Corbin's hotel, 
And he knocked the guests too far to tell; 
He went to the beach to take a 
swim, 
But he drank up the ocean and sang a 
hymn. 
With a 
chew of tobacco he put out the moon, 
And Levy's cornet he kicked all out of tune; 
Pushed a 
train of cars from the elevated track 
And then for a 
joke he put them all back. 
He started on foot to reach Brazil, 
And that is the last I 
have seen of the gill— 
For he was a 
terrible man, 
Composed 1)5T IIARRY BENNETT, and sung with success by BILLY 
CARTER. 
Oh, love is such a 
very funny thing, 
And it catches the young and the old, 
It's just like a 
plate of boarding-house hash, 
And many a 
man it has sold. 
It makes you feel like a 
fresh water eel, 
And causes your head to swell. 
You lose your mind, for love is blind, 
And it empties your pocket-book as well. 
CHORUS. 
Boys keep away from the gals, I 
say, 
Give them lots of room, 
Or you'll find when you're wed, 
They will bang you till you're dead, 
With bald-headed end of a 
broom. 
When man is gone on a 
pretty little gal, 
Ile talks just as gentle as a 
dove; 
He spends all his money, and calls her his honey, 
. 
For to show her he is solid on his love. 
When his money is gone and his clothes in hock, 
He finds the old saying it is true, 
That a 
mole on the arm is worth two on the leg, 
But what is ha going for to do. 
boys keep away, etc, 
When married folks have lots of cash, 
Their love is firm and strong, 
But when they have to feed on hash 
Their love don't last so long. 
With a 
wife and seventeen half-starved kids, 
I 
tell you its no fun. 
When your butcher comes around to collect his bill, 
With a 
dog and double barrel gun. 
Boys keep away, etc. 
Young fellows just take my advice, 
Don't be in a 
hurry for to wed, 
You think you're in clover till the honey-moon's over, 
And then you'll think you're dead. 
With a 
cross-eyed baby on each knee, 
And a 
wife with a 
plaster on her nose, 
Yo-4611 find true love don't run so very smooth, 
When you have to wear your second-hand clothes 
Boys keep away, ete. 
When the rent is high, and the kids all cry 
Because there's no grub to chaw, 
You'll holler for your son 
To load up your gun, 
While you vaccinate mother-in-law. 
CONEY ISLE, 
Written /ey obe. HIPAIGIN. 
Originally sung by BILLY CARTER. 
At Jo German Saratoga, 
Way down at Coney Isle, 
I 
thought I'd go in swimming, 
Just for to see the style 
Of the different kinds of Mermaids, 
And near them yell and screech, 
While flopping in the water, 
At Coney Island beach. 
There was ladies and babies, 
As happy as could be, 
Dutch tailors and Dutch brewers, 
A 
swimming in the sea. 
Dry goods clerks in bathing, 
Looking like a 
barber's pole; 
All de Dutch from Ifackerelville, 
Like porpoise they did roll; 
The shop girls look like naaids, 
Floating from the shore, 
Young man newly married, 
Trying to drown his mother-in-law. 
There was drummers and bummers, 
As dirty as could be, 
Taking in their maiden wash, 
A 
swimming in the sea. 
All the biggest pc,111*.n!.

The fattest and the lean, 
All the water in the ocean 
Could'nt wash them clean. 
Barnum's big fat woman 
Swam our to a 
boat, 
All the buoys in the water 
Would'nt make her float 
Mere were Hannahs and Johannalsa, 
Maria's and Marie, 
Treading clams, the little lambs, 
While swimming in the sea. 
There was a 
lot of preachers, 
Who came from Brooklyn town, 
Went in to wash their sins away, 
But wickedness wont go down; 
It floated like the garbage, 
And kept within their reach, 
There's a 
good deal from Brooklyn, 
Hangs heavy on the beach. 
There were ladies and babies, 
As happy as can be, 
Eat chowder at Mike Norton's, 
After swimming in the sea.

Courting a 
Farmer's Daughter. 
Entered according to Act of Congress in the year 1875, by A. J 
F/SHER, in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington 
Music by W M. CASTER. - 
I 
once did love a 
girl named Sal, 
Each day I 
went to court her, 
She's a 
farmer's daughter on the hill, 
And I 
tell you she's a 
snorter ; 
Last Sunday noon, alone with her, 
My love with her revealing, 
The question I 
was going to pop, 
When the pigs set up a 
squealing. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, the pigs did squeal, and dance a 
reel 
And the old torn turkey gobbled; 
And the shanghai crow'd bis cockadoodle000, 
And the brindle cow was sneezing. 
I 
went again last Sunday night, 
And the pigs had stopped their squeal Ing ; 
The old tom turkey, and the big shanghai, 
And the brindle cow, were sleeping; 
Will you be mine, dear Sal? says I, 
Before her I 
was kneeling ; 
)3ut before she'd time to say yes, or no, 
The pigs again went squealing. 
Yes, the pigs did, &c. 
. 
I 
called on Sal again, next day, 
To ask how she was feeling; 
I 
found her feeding the little pigs 
To make them stop their squealing; 
The plan is a 
good one, Sal, said I, 
As a 
kiss I 
was a 
stealing; 
The pigs stopp'd eating and looked at me, 
And again set up a 
squealing. 
Yes, the pigs did, &c. 
I 
felt disgusted, and left the spot, 
And resolved I'd never marry 
A 
farmer's daughter for a 
wife; 
But a 
batchelor I 
would tarry. 
So let her pigs squeal if they choose— 
The truth I 
am revealing, 
Each night and day when I 
pass that way, 
The damned old pigs are squealing! 
Yes, the pigs did, &c.

For which I 
said I'd pay; 
Said she, " Get out, you black and tan, 
You'll give the snap away." 
I 
asked her if she'd fly with me, 
To some secluded spot? 
She said it wasn't fly time, 
And she guessed she'd rather not. 
We agreed to wait ' till the summer time, 
When the beans and peas were ripe.— 
But she choked to death with a 
Russian. towel 
She ate for a 
piece of tripe. 
BILLY BARRY'S PINAFORE. 
Composed, and sung with great success by the Great 
Billy Barry. 
I 
am the monarch of Limburger cheese, 
When I 
eat, it's go as you please; 
I 
wear piccadilly's and tight- legged pants, 
And so does my sisters, cousins and my aunts. 
Now I 
think that it's awfully mean, 
To treat a 
girl to ice cream, 
When you've only got a 
half-a-dollar in your pants, 
And she invites all her sisters, her cousins and her aunts. 
Henry Ward Beecher is a 
fine plum, 
He says that he never drinks rum, 
But he'll kiss a 
pretty girl when he gets a 
chance, 
And he'll never tell his sisters, cousins or his aunts. 
I 
am a 
pedestrian by trade, 
Seven hundred and fifty miles I've made, 
VII make another lap if they'll give me the chance, 
For to sit on my sisters, cousins and aunts.

KAMAIIAIVIALOO. 
Written and originally sung by Biwa Coml. 
Now I'll sing to you a 
little song 
That you've never heard before, 
You'll bust your ears with laughing, 
And fall upon the floor 
For remember that a 
rolling stone 
Is worth twenty on a 
tree, 
So stay at home and don't go out 
To skip the tra la la lee. 
Now an elephant was a 
sitting 
And locking up his trunk, 
Some boys fed him on pepper sauce, 
And soon it made him drunk, 
He broke the keeper in pieces, 
And roared an awful roar, 
Swallowed eleven peanut stands, 
And a 
bushel of apple core. 
A 
parrot sat a 
winking 
And blinking at a 
crow, 
They both went to a 
theatre, 
To see the latest show. 
The crow it got a

With a 
Scotch terrier purp, 
The parrot eat a 
fire cracker 
And blew the theatre up.

I'se gwine to write a

To my great Jehovah, 
I

When de boat am going over. 
I'se got a 
quill from an angel's wing, 
'Twas sent to me by de great good King, 
An angel dropped a

'Twas silver ink at de King's command,

The Man in the Moon is Looking, Love, 
As sung by LOLA MORT1MOR. 
Published by E. H. HARDING, 229 Bowery, New York. 
You all know what this feeling is, 
When at some quiet spot, 
All around you may be ice, 
But the love's burning hot. 
Of course her hand so tight you squeeze, 
As you both gaze afar; 
Yes, while the moon is laughing at you, 
Knowing what fools you are. 
SPOKEN.—When you 'are in love, and sitting on some ro-
inantic cliff, by the light of the moon you gaze in the girl's 
face, and imagine how much powder and rouge she has been 
putting on; and she's thinking at the same time what express-
ive eyes, how his nose turns up, and I 
think I 
should love him 
a 
little more if it was a 
Roman, and the moon is winking at 
you and seems to say— 
Ctio.—The man in the moon is looking, love, 
He's winking, love, he's blinking, love; 
And each little star can tell where you are, 
The man in the moon is looking. 
The other night, on Dover cliffs, 
A 
girl sat there with me; 
The moon above kept peeping on+ 
With look of naughty glee. 
I 
whispered tales of love, and said, 
Don't be a 
timid miss, 
But while the moon's behind a 
cloud 
Just one sweet little kiss. 
SPOKEN. — Not now. 
Don't you see the man ? 
What man ? 
Why, the man in the moon! 
He's laughing at us. 
But just 
one, dear! 
No, no!—(enonus.) 
As we sat gazing at the moon, 
Like spooney lovers do, 
My arm of course was round her waist, 
Nigh squeezing her in two. 
I 
heard the moon say to the stars, 
That pair I'll go and wed, 
And as the moon came from above, 
I 
rolled clean out of bed. 
SPOKEN. —It was a 
dream. 
I 
was not on Dover cliff sitting 
with a 
girl by moonlight. I was in bed at Brixton with a 
rushlight shining upon me, and dreaming it was the moon, and 
my darling Matilda saying—(Cnoacs.) 
1A/Titten by Edwin Talbot, and sung by Murphy & Mack. 
An Irishman, as you can see, 
I'm known both far and wide. 
Since I've been in this country 
I 
have been the people's pride, 
When first I 
landed in New York 
It filled me with conceit, 
The kids say, " Murph, for digging turf, 
You have the real elegant feet. 
CHORUS— 
For the other day I.heard them say 
That me nose looked like a 
beet, 
Then all the gang with vulgar slang. 
Roared, Murphy, anchor yer feet. 
My Delia Clancy, that's the girl I 
love, 
Sure I 
called on her the other night, 
And swore by all the clouds above. 
- 
For there was none out that night, 
Says I, " My darling charming Delia, 
My heart is yours complete." 
Says she, " I 
won't have any funny business, 
Oh, Murphy, anchor yer feet." 
Sure it's President they say I'd be, 
If it wasn't for this hullabaloo. 
If my head was only the size of my feet, 
And of course that's very true. 
You might know I'm a 
prominent man, 
For every one I 
meet as I 
stroll along. 
You'll hear the gang shout, " Holloa, 
Murphy, anchor yer feet." 
Chorus 
Pretty Little Blue-Eyed Stranger. 
Copyrighted 5877, by F. W . 
HELMICK, 136 West Fourth street, 
Cincinnati, Ohio. 
Written, composed and sung by BOBBY NEWCOMBE, with great success. 
When the summer breeze vras blowing 
O'er the land and far across the sea; 
I 
met a 
little blue-eyed stranger, 
As pretty as can be, 
Her dress the pink of neatness, 
Her walk the height of grace, 
Her smile the mould of sweetness, 
And such a 
handsome face. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! when the summer breeze was blowing, 
O'er the land and far across the sea, 
I 
met a 
little blue-eyed stranger, 
As pretty as can be. 
Wavy golden ringlets flowing 
To the breeze so merry, light and free, 
That kissed the little blue-eyed stranger, 
As pretty as can be. 
Towards her I 
walked gaily, 
While waves rolled on the shore, 
I 
tried to speak, but vainly, 
I 
ne'er felt so before. 
Oh! when the summer, &c. 
The sequel to the story knowing, 
The end of course you'd like to hear from mc; 
I've wed this little blue-eyed stranger, 
As pretty as can be. 
We're living in contentment 
Just down by the shore, 
And another little stranger 
Now plays around the door. 
Oh! when the summer, &c. 
Words by JOHN M. 
TURNER. 
Sung by J. D. Rom?. 
Good evening folks, I 
have just dropped in 
To pla for you, and to swing my chin; 
If I 
don't suit, just call " Police I" 
And bind me over to keep the peace, 
Or lay me up on the mantel piece. 
My song relates to a 
youth named Slade, 
And biting pies was this young man's trade; 
He could bite any pie that he ever yet saw, 
Whether baked in the oven or served up raw, 
Fricasied pie from the hardware store. 
For he was a 
youth without reproof, 
He'd gobble a 
pie with a 
Mansard roof. 
A 
pie- us man was this youth named Slade, 
With a 
specialty act in the pie-biting trade. 
Pies one foot thick were nothing to him— 
He'd open his jaws and in they'd skim; 
Canned tripe pie just suited his taste, 
And a 
Washington pie he ne'er would waste, 
For he would stow it away in haste. 
But baker's pies he did most despise. 
Because he said they were stuffed with flies. 
His principal act was to stand on his eye, 
And catch in his mouth a 
home-made pie, 
For this young man was terrible fly. 
For he was a 
youth, etc. 
This mournful tale I 
must now conclude; 
If I 
stay longer you'll think me rude. 
But before I 
go I 
must here relate, 
That biter of pies' deplorable late, 
Which happened precisely as I 
state. 
He made a 
match, to his friends surprise, 
To bite through ninety plates and pies; 
But those big pies were stuffed with sand, 
And they gave him a 
walk in the promised land; 
So he's got a 
date you will understand. 
For he was a 
youth, etc.

The Cards are arranged in

swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-

are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

Courting. Cards.— This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such P. way as to be non-committaL 
Many young ladies are visited by 
ntlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation um, 
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG 
ft is a Fac simile of a Trick practiced by all 
the Professors of Magic. 
Mes.W.~Wro.a 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a 
leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order 
has been sent us, called ‘11IIMPTY DUINIPTY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear-
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rap idly 
over, can make 
itb ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. 
A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at home in the hand-
hug of it."—Phila. Evening .Bulletin.
