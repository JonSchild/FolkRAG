Flower of the Forest: Or, the Discarded Daughter. 
A tale of sad interest—cannot fail to have a 
great reception. 
Price 25 cents, Single copies sent postage free on receipt of price. 
AIR—" Charming Young Widow." 
While walking down Broadway, one morning, and 
thinking, 
Of the funny creatures which Fashion has bred, 
As shown by the " Pancakes," the " Sundowns," 
the " Gypsies," 
And all the queer things the girls wear on the 
head, 
I saw "\Vaterfalls," "Puffs," " Rats," " Mice," 
and cheek " Plumpers," 
Worn by maids, wives and widows, and dashing 
young flirts, 
But, nothing so much, took my eye or my fancy, 
As those 
killing, enchanting, suggestive Tilt 
Skirts. 
While thinking, before me, I 
saw, what a 
figure, 
My eyes were entranc'd, I 
was dumb with surprise, 
She'd the waist of a 
Venus, a 
bust fit for Juho, 
And the wickedest, killingest kind of black eyes 
She smil'd, such a smile! as before a shop 
window, 
She stopp'd, first to peep—I 
was on the alert,

Graphic details of the bloody deeds that crimsoned this river.

The Tilt Skirt Songster. 
And as gracefully forward, she stoop'd for a mo-
ment, 
I 
saw such a 
sight! 
0, that blessed Tilt Skirt. 
What a 
foot! 
What an ankle! 
They set my 
heart bumping! 
Oh, how my mouth wateed, as onward she sped, 
And I 
follow'd, panting, and hoping and fearing, 
With a 
thousand wild thoughts rushing•through 
my poor head, 
When, all of a 
sudden, she dash'd in a 
doorway, 
And up stairs, she tripp'd— I 
hope 'twas not pert— 
But who could restrain his eyes from then feasting, 
On all 'twas reveal'd by that blessed Tilt Skirt ! 
What a 
foot! 
What a 
gaiter! an ankle, oh, dear 
me, 
It quite drives me mad, but to think of it now, 
And then what a 
leg I 
spann'd by such a 
sweet 
gaiter I 
I 
felt, quite all over, I 
cannot tell how! 
I 
waited, how could I 
leave a 
feast so enchanted, 
Five long minuted pass'd and still on the alert, 
I 
saw her come down, and at each step she tilted, 
And I 
fairly wilted! oh, that blessed Tilt Skirt. 
For a 
moment I 
stood without power to follow, 
As she daintily tripp'd along, over the " Russ," 
But soon summon'd courage, and caught up with 
my charmer, 
Just as she her fingers held up for a 'bus! 
It stopp'd. 
The door open'd I Her dry goods she 
lifted. 
I 
stood in the rush, unmindful of hurt, 
Ye gods! what a 
heaven to my eyes was then 
open'd! 
As once more she tilted, that blessed Tilt Skirt! 
I 
rusli'd in behind her, a 
seat took beside her, 
At the end of the street she rose to go out, 
TOM TRUCK; Or, The Wizard Crew. 
A 
wild and startling romance of the ocean and its blackest clouds.

The Tilt Skirt Songster. 
And I 
rose as well, I 
was in such a 
fever 
That really, I 
knew not what I 
was about 
I 
follow'd her, spoke; she blush'd, I 
insisted 
On seeing her home, and she prov,'d no flirt— 
For she quickly consented, and I've never re-
pented 
The day that I 
first saw, that blessed Tilt Skirt. 
The Dancing Wife. 
Ann :—" The 13rother-in-Law." 
You see here a 
man, who's been plagued through 
his life, 
With that curse of all curse., a 
dancing mad 'wife. 
Though I 
chose with discretion, with prudence and 
care, 
If she danc'd I'd not have her, though ever so fair, 
For if a 
wife dances for mere dancing sake, 
You may be certain some false step she'll take. 
Such a 
wild dance they'll lead you and make you 
their butt, 
So if I 
caught them dancing I 
took steps to cut. 
CHORUS. 
So I 
gave them to know that I 
strongly forbid it, 
But I'll show Yon the way that all of them did it. 
The first girl I 
courted was gentle and kind, 
A 
duck of a 
creature, quite up to my mind; 
Yet beauty's but skin deep, and not of much use, 
And a 
duck of a 
girl makes a 
man oft a 
goose, 
One day in her arms I 
was breathing loves flame, 
An organ-grinder right under the window there 
came, 
Her favorite he played which she saw no fault in, 
She bounced from my arms and went round the 
room waltzing.

parti-colored web, woven of Crime, Shame, and Retribution.

The Tilt Skirt Songster. 
Dance she would, and dance she did, though 
strongly I 
forbid it, 
She kept waltzing round the room and this is the 
way she did it. 
The next girl I 
tried was a 
Miss Lucy Creggr, 
And what stole my eye was her beautiful leg, 
Which I 
saw one day as I 
stood on the landing; 
I'm delighted to see a 
girl's good understanding. 
" 
Oh, fie, sir 1" cried she, " now, what you arter ?" 
" 
I 
am measuring your beautiful leg for a 
garter," 
"If you like my legs," 
says she, " here's a 
chance," 
Up she jumped and started bang off in a.dance. 
Dance she would, and dance she did, though 
strongly I 
forbid it, 
She kept waltzing round the room and this is the 
way she did it. 
I 
was not licked at this, made another advance, 
In search of a 
girl that knew not how to dance, 
And I 
met with as fondly I 
thought, 
But she'd musical feet and again I 
was caught. 
One day I 
was walking with her hand in hand, 
In a 
wild Highland fling struck up a 
brass band, 
In a 
fling off she started, fast hold of my hand. 
Off she starts dancing and you plainly could see. 
The length of her leg from her heel to her knee, 
I 
yet tried another and hailed the rare chance, 
I'd at last found a 
wife that knew not bow to 
dance, 
Went to church and got married, my wife home-
homeward led, 
But the very first night she got dancing in bed, 
Vainly I 
tried to persuade or oppose, 
She kept up her dance, she kicked off all the 
clothes,

I 
was hampered for life without the least chance , 
For it seems she had got the St. Vitus's dance. 
She danced day and night, I'd no power to forbid 
it. 
And in this comical style it was that she did it 
Obedience at Fault. 
The harmless burden of my song, 
To some prim folks will take offence, 
But to do a 
moral wrong 
I 
have not the least pretence. 
From the marriage lines I 
quote, 
Which all loving couples say, 
Without thinking while they doat, 
To love, honour, and obey. 
CHORUS. 
Husbands to love and cherish, 
say, 
Wives, love, honour, and obey. 
SPOKEN. 
Love !—But there are so many sorts of love: 
there is fat love, lean love, slow love, fast love, self 
love, brotherly love, and. cupboard love, that is 
policeman's love, and such love is all kitchen stuff. 
Love is like a 
pancake: it won't frizzle without fat, 
and very often all the fat is in the fire, and the pan-
cake will burn if it's not turned, and so will love. 
Now I 
always turned my love, by turning it to the 
best advantage. 
It's of no use to make legs to fit 
little stockings, if you can't buy the stockings to fit 
little legs. 
But a 
wife is a 
responsible creature, and.

He thought he'd hit upon a 
plan, 
To banish all domestic strife, 
Said he, " This plan's laid down, 
When and where whate'er I 
say, 
You must neither pout or frown, 
But both my looks and words obey. 
Of course I 
said, Yes, my dear, certainly. 
We 
often say what we don't mean, and mean what we 
don't say. 
What is the use of pulling against wind 
and tide. 
You may as well give chase to a 
flash of 
lightning, or try to roast a 
snowball till it's brown. 
And then we should always give and take, for we 
have all got our weak points and soft places. 
I 
had found out his weak point, and he thought he 
had found out my soft place, and 
Husbands to love, &c. 
To-morrow I 
expect a 
friend 
A 
week's visit here to pay, 
To my 'commands, now, wife, attend, 
What lie says or does mind you obey. 
I 
must a 
little journey take, 
On business did my husband say, 
Now make him welcome for my sake, 
And what he says mind you obey. 
Husbands to love, &c. 
SPOKEN. 
Well, my husband went and his 
friend came 
Mr. John Bunkham. A 
dashing handsome young 
rifle volunteer. 
Well, he made himself at home. 
According to my husband's commands I 
made him 
welcome. 
He was gay. 
He asked me to take a 
walk: I 
obeyed. 
He asked for a 
kiss; I 
obeyed. 
He chose a 
spare rib of beef for dinner; of course, 
I 
obeyed. 
But oh, oh, thought I, my husband has 
left me, so you think I 
am a 
rib to spare. 
Oh, oh,

Wherever he sailed desolatten followed in his track.'

thought I, Mr. Rifle, you don't rifle my husband's 
treasure in his absence, I 
soon found out his weak 
point but I 
took great care he didn't find out my 
soft place. 
Husbands to love, &c. 
On my husbands jealous pangs then came 
Full in torments deep and sore, 
Crying " Zounds, I'vis been to blame, 
Rushed back and thundered at the door 
With wrathful voice and angry head, 
" 
Your mistsess ?" to the girl did say, 
" 
Gone with the visitor to bed, 
Your commands, sir, to obey." 
Husbands to love, &c, 
First he raved then round he spun, 
Like a 
madman in a 
play. 
Said he to me, " What have you done?" 
" 
What your friend wished I 
did obey, 
But I 
knew my duty unto you, 
To my own lone bed I 
took my way, 
Yet we both went to bed ' tis true, 
You know I 
dare not disobey." 
Husbands to love, &C. 
SPOKEN. 
But though he is your friend he don't keep the 
whole of the ten commandments, for he does covet 
his neighbors's wife. 
Oh, but I 
could see his weak 
point, but I 
would not let him find my soft place,. 
Husbands to love, &c. 
The Good-tempered Man. 
What a 
pity to hear some people declare, 
That life is a 
burden of sorrow and care;

And of troubles I've had a 
full share.

And I 
find it is wiser to laugh than to cry, 
And merrily sing if you can, 
Clouds that are dark may clear bye-and-bye. 
So laugh like a 
good-tempered man. 
Ha! ha! ha! 
I 
was always a 
good-tempered man. 
My courting I 
paid to a 
fair pretty maid, 
When I 
asked her to wed she lovingly said, 
Dear Daniel it's true I'm faithful to you, 
Believe me and don't be afraid ;" 
But in less than a 
month her promise she broke, 
And off with another she ran: 
I 
laugh'd and treated it all as a 
joke, 
For I'm such a 
good-tempered man. 
Ha! ha I 
ha 1 
Oh! I'm such a 
good-tempered man. 
A 
mob in the street I 
happened to meet. 
A 
thief with a 
snatch ran away with my watch, 
My hat with surprise was knock'd over my eyes, 
Crying " Stop thief 1" the people all ran; 
But I 
never moved an inch from the spot, 
But to laugh and dance I 
began, 
To think what a 
guy at that moment I 
look'd, 
Oh 1 
I'm such a 
good-tempered man. 
Ha ha l 
ha 1 
Ohl I'm such a 
good-tempered man. 
Then never give way to that demon dismay, 
If to-day you are down and acquaintances frown 
To-morrow may bring quite a 
different thing, 
And life's but a 
flash in the pan: 
If care as they tell us once killed the poor cat, 
Though scarcely believe them I 
can, 
Like me you are bound to get jolly and fat, 
If you laugh like a 
good-tempered man, 
Ha! ha 1 
I 
was always a 
good-tempered man.

Have You Seen Her Lately. 
Ata—" Paddy Whack." 
I 
stand before you bathed in tears, 
My heart with anguish panting, 
I 
once was fat, but now am thin, 
Without the aid of Banting. 
The reason is—I 
lost my love, 
No damsel could be fairer, 
Her fighting weight was thirteen stone, 
And her maiden name was Sarah. 
CHORUS. 
She went away, a 
month to-day, 
Her absence grieves me greatly, 
She'd a 
strawberry mark upon her arm, 
Have you seen her lately ? 
She's cheeks like lilies, eyes like sloes, 
And fingers long and taper; 
Her hair is red to match her nose, 
And mostly worn in paper. 
I 
cannot guess, upon my life, 
What she has gone away for, 
She's taken every stick away 
That I 
have had to pay for. 
She went away, &c. 
She has my watch, I 
lent it her, 
It was a 
gold Geneva, 
I 
never thought till now that watch 
Would prove to be a 
lever. 
I've sought her east, I've sought her west 
And done my best to find her, 
This little note addressed to me, 
Is all she's left behind her. 
She went away, &c.

" 
My dearest Sammy," that means me, 
" 
I 
shan't be long away, dear; 
I've gone to stay at Albany, 
So don't be anxious, pray, dear. 
Your watch is at my uncle's, love, 
The name I 
gave was Cricket, 
But keep your courage up, old boy, 
For I 
here enclose the ticket." 
She went away,'&c. 
I've been to-day to Albany, 
And search it through and through, sir, 
I 
asked and asked, yet strange to say, 
No one my Sarah knew, sir. 
But she of course, will soon come back, 
My lot to be a 
sharer, 
And when she does, if you'll come here, 
I'll introduce my Sarah. 
She went away, &e. 
The Bonnet Trimmer. 
A IR.—" The Organ Grinder." 
You see before you Mary Anne, 
Dying inches Wry day, 
Through a 
false young man, one Pickled Bill, 
Who thiev'd my heart away; 
He vowed he loved me honorably, 
Ne'er again should part. 
To a 
Bonnet Trimmer he's wed now, 
Oh my poor bleeding heart, heart, heart. 
CHORUS. 
How I 
sobs when I 
thinks of his false love, 
How my blood does simmer, 
Only let me catch her, Heavens above, 
I 
will kill his Bonnet Trimmer.

SPOKEN.—I
'll hang for her. 
Now Pickl'd Bill, do oysters sell, 
I 
am a 
housemaid, 
Five pounds a 
year, tea and beer, 
Quarterly am paid; 
Oh the oysters he has given me, 
Mussels, clams, and eels, 
To think that another he should wed, 
Raving mad I 
feels, feels, feels. 
How I 
sobs when, &c. 
SPOKEN.—Not that I'm jealous. 
Now it was but the other day 
Before a 
bonnet shop, 
Half way down the Bowery, 
Saw Pickled Billy stop, 
On the shoulder then I 
touched him, 
Said, " what brings you here ?" 
He said, " I 
was only going to buy 
A 
bonnet for you, dear, dear, dear." 
How I 
sobs when, &c. 
SPoKEN.—Oh! the deceit of the men. 
Daggers on him then I 
looked, 
Away from him did walk, 
I 
watched, the Bonnet Trimmer saw 
With him in deep tal k„ 
That was ok'lar proof for me, 
I 
directly turned him up, 
" 
I 
must be content to taste, said I, 
False love's bitter cup, cup, cup." 
SPOKEN.—I 
wish there was no men.

heard of Pickl'd Bill, 
That he was mar-ri-ed,

Like Othello, hope he will some night 
Smother her in bed. 
But to fret any more for a 
man like that, 
Nor care a 
single jot, 
I'm sure I 
shan't, fish better there are 
In the sea than e'er was caught. 
Never more I'll care for this man I 
loved, 
Altho' my blood does simmer, 
He may stab himself with his oyster knife, 
Yes, and his Bonnet Trimmer.

Man too quickly far would grasp, 
So she keeps the blushing rose 
Hidden in the rosebud's clasp, 
But as 'twill burst poor nature's shield, 
When the genial sun shall shine; 
So let care to pleasure yield, 
Then fill the bowl, come drain the wine.

Day or night no pleasure bring, 
Ah, what is life when bright and brief ?

And if perchance ill-luck be mine, 
I'll ask the goblet's good advice,

At the fair girl dress'd in check. 
My dress was looped up gracefully which showed

With a

Very captivating, &c. 
One night home escorting her, so earnest did press 
Her mine to become, when she answered" Yes." 
A

directly began, 
Thinking myself such a 
happy young man. 
SPOKEN.—I certainly must admit that I 
was 
desperately smitten, she was so 
Very captivating, '&c. 
Two rings I 
bought her, a

Oh, how she thanked me again and again, 
Fixed was the wedding-day when only conceive, 
The following letter I 
did receive. 
SPOKEN.—The address was delicate, ladylike

So very nicely 
Written and neat, 
From the pretty little milliner. 
Of New Canal Street. 
"Excuse me but marry you I 
cannot," she said,

Would I 
lend it to them for the honeymoon,

plainly could see, 
For nothing endearing there was about me. 
SPOKEN.—That was certainly, candidly, free, and 
very ungrateful to one lie, 
Very captivating, &o:

Of meeting a

It is a

It lived in other days; 
When men were rude, their passions wild, 
Their sport thick battle frays: 
When in armour bright the warrior bold 
Knelt to his lady's eyes; 
Beneath the abbey pavements cold 
That warrior's dust now lies.*

The iron hearts of that old day 
Have mouldered in the grave; 
And chivalry passed away 
With knights so true and brave. 
The honour which to them was life, 
Throbs in no bosom now; 
It only gilds the gambler's strife, 
Or decks the worthless brow."

When this fair earthly ball was first form'd by 
kind nature, 
And stock'd with each species of sensitive creature; 
To man, happy man, by the favor of heav'n, 
A 
privilege great and peculiar was given. 
For soon as the cold wintry blast howl'd around, 
And the foul fiend of frost 'gan disfigure the 
ground, 
To gladden man's heart, and his spirits to cheer, 
Jove kindly bade Old Father Christmas appear. 
At the heav'nly mandate the sage quick arose, 
With huge corporation, and carbuncl'd nose; 
Such a 
queer laughing fellow has never, I 
ween, 
Since the days of Dad Adam, 'mongst mortals

But to punch jolly mortals soon alter'd its name. 
And lest simple man should live rather too sober,

Whilst a 
long train of scullions and cooks came 
behind; 
All laden with prog to keep out the old wind. 
Receive, cries the old one, the rich gifts of Jove, 
Punch, pudding, and beef, piping hot from above; 
And since I'm cornmisioned to visit the earth, 
Odd niggins I'll stay, and take part in the mirth. 
But should I 
find reason to relish your cheer, 
You may look for my company once every year; 
But when Old Father Christmas comes mortals 
among, 
Pray welcome his presence with mirth, dance, and 
song. 
Then come, my good fellows, be not over nice, 
But for once in your life follow wholesome advice; 
And drink to a

May we live to greet Christmas some forty years

AIR :—"Jaunting Car." 
One day last week as by the house of a 
friend I 
chanced to pass, 
He stopped me and in secret said he was courting 
a 
nice young lass, 
With sweet blue eyes and flaxen hair, which she 
always ware in curl, 
" 
I 
wish you joy," said I, " Old boy, why don't you

"It isn't money," my reply, " brings haspiness

Along -the forest straying, 
One summer ev'ning fair, 
We talk'd—the breezes playing 
'Mid Jessio's golden hair. 
Up from my breast there rose, 
A 
question soft aiid low, 
It whispered, " can you love me ? 
Sweet Jessie— don't say no." 
No sound that summer gloaming, 
Returned my beating heart, 
Still, thro' the wild wood roaming, 
I 
felt we ne'er could part. 
At last my Jessie, blushing, 
And looking lovely so, 
" 
Will you be ever constant" 
She murmur'd—" don't say no."

Why have my loved ones gone, 
Like the dew 'neath the early sun ? 
Why am I

While all their troubles here are done ? 
My days of youth have passed away, 
And the shades of life are near; 
But I 
still remain to mourn the happy days 
When dear departed friends were here.

Why have my loved ones gone, 
Gone to return no more— 
Calmly gliding o'er a 
summer sea, 
Whils't I'm left plodding on the shore ? 
Why have my loved ones gone, 
From the joys and pain of life ? 
Why do I 
still live on, 
Alone to battle in the strife ? 
Alone to struggle in the fray, 
Till ray earthly cares are done— 
While the young, the fair have vanished from the 
day, 
Before their sorrows had begun ?

All things around are beautiful and fair, 
And still my spirit lies in gloom.

I

But seek her, alas, still in vain— 
In the cabin where oft we have met, 
On the waves of the white-crested main.

She is gone—she is lost—she is dead— 
The beautiful maid of my soul.

The flute that she loved so to play— 
The vase, too, she treasured is there,

The Young Carpen.tier. 
In Brooklyn I've heard people say, 
There once lived a 
dashing young blade, 
With the girls he was flirting and gay, 
And a 
carpentier was by his trade, 
Till at length by Cupid he got nailed, 
By Hymen glued to his dear, 
With his axe, axe, chisel, chisel, chisel, axe, axe, 
and gimlets, 'tis clear, 
.In matrimony was this young carpentier. 
Now Chip's wife had an old lovier, 
A 
lovier that ploughed the salt sea, 
Now, he, naughty boy left his mother, 
And a 
nautical man now was he, 
So when he came home he embraced her, 
At the sight Chip fell down right with fear, 
With his axe, axe, chisel, chisel, chisel, axe, axe, 
and gimlets, 'tis clear, 
With jealousy wild went this young carpentier. 
Then he went upstairs to his tool-chest. 
And then he did open the lid, 
He turned out every one of his tools, 
Right down to the bottom he did. 
From the downermost part he selected 
An instrument sharp and severe, 
With his axe, axe, chisel, chisel, chisel, axe, axe, 
and gimlets, 'tis clear, 
"Revenge;" then he cried did this young carpen-
tier. 
Sc) he followed his wife down the street, 
followed her down a 
dark lane, 
Then he followed her right round a 
square, 
And back by the same street again. 
He stabbed her somewhere round the corner, 
Her screams were appalling to hear,

wife: or, the Adventures of a

What a 
wonderful man the Postman is, 
As he hastens from door to door; 
What a 
medley of news his hands contain, 
For high, low, rich and poor. 
In many a

In as many he grief can see, 
As the door is opened to his loud RAN TAN, 
And his quick delivery. 
Every morn, as true as the clock, 
Somebody hears the Postman's Knock! 
No. 1, he presents with the news of a 
birth, 
With tidings of death No. 4, 
At 13, a 
bill of terrible length 
He drops throuk:11 the hole in the door; 
A 
cheque or an order at 15 he leaves, 
And 16 his presence cloth prove; 
While 17 does an acknowledgment get, 
And I8—a 
letter of love! 
Every morning, as true as the clock, 
Somebody hears the Postman's Knock!

Minnie Bell the Captain's Daughter. 
It was late in summer last; 
I 
went a 
trip to Newport quit content, 
A month of pleasure might be spent, 
Somewhere about that quarter. 
One morn I 
strolled the band to hear, 
When tripping lightly -from the pier, 
I 
spied a 
charming little dear, 
The queen of girls I 
thought her. - 
CHORUS. 
For she'd light blue eyes and golden hair, 
Tiny little feet and a 
waist so rare, 
A 
face and form beyond compare, 
And she was a 
Captain's daughter.

Entranced I 
watched her down the sands, 
A camp stool she had in her hands, 
And from her hands a 
poodle lands, 
. 
Who scampered to the water. 
A 
cruel wave dashed up and drew 
Her poodle under, down I 
flew, 
My charmer screaming, " Save lihn do," 
As in my arms I 
caught her. • 
For she'd light, &c.

My sunshade saved her poodle well, 
Whilst drying him, I 
begged she'd tell 
Her name, she blushed, said, " Mhpaie Bell," 
How beautiful I 
thought her. f 
A 
parent's love she'd never know, 
They died when she was so old grown, 
Since then an uncle's care alone, 
Who'd now to Newport brought her. 
For she'd light:&c. 
We 
strolled, we chatted many things, 
The waltz from Faust, Saratoga Springs, 
Of gloves, and doves and wedding rings, 
How cleverly I 
caught her.

To nunky dear, the best of men, 
She smiling promised and at ten, 
Next morn 
did escort her.

removed next day,

went straightway,

One morn I 
woke and sought in vain, 
My boots, my purse, my watch and chain, 
My door unlocked too, gone, ' twas plain, 
I 
called out thieves and slaughter. 
Up rushed the waiters in dismay,

shouted, where are they,

The fate that befel me the other day, 
For on my life, I 
wanted a 
wife; 
But to get one no how could tell the way, 
I 
looked around, for girls abound, 
And married many would wish to be, 
But alas! there was none who with me would run 
Away from their homes and family. 
CHORUS. 
So then if married you would be, 
Mind that you always strive to see 
The face of your bride without a 
veil, 
Or, when too late, your own cruel fate, forever 
you will bewail. 
Both far and near I 
sought for a 
dear, 
But none could I 
see that suited my taste, 
Till one so merry, with lips like cherries, 
I 
spied with a 
small and slender waist, 
A 
sedate old dame exceedingly plain, 
Was walking along by my charmer's- 
side, 
At the young one so nice I 
walked once or twice, 
And thought I 
should like her to be my bride.

Now I 
got introduced, and very soon used 
To flatter the mother and court the girl ; 
Treat her brother Jim, bow she used to kiss him, 
A 
favour she never would with me share, 
Tho' she promised to be my bride, do you see, 
If I 
would allow her to wear her veil, 
Of course I 
did not mind whether in front or be-
hind, 
From one or the other always trail. 
So then if married, &c. 
To church then I 
went, on happiness bent, 
The bride and her mother to follow behind, 
Their faces did shroud from the sight of the 
crowd, 
And said, " for that favor was very kind ;" 
Then up to the altar, as I 
thought, led the daugh-
ter, 
I 
married soon, when her veil did fall, 
Good Lord, 'twas another, I 
had married her 
mother, 
So the young one had duped me after all. 
So then if Married, &c. 
That's how I 
was daae, for the daughter did run 
Away with the fellow they call brother Jim, 
Oh, wasn't it kind to leave me behind 
With a 
nasty old woman as ugly as sin, 
I 
cannot live at home, so away I 
must roam, 
For the neighbors will chaff me out of my life, 
For from this very day all her bills I 
must pay, 
So be careful whenever you are looking for a 
wife.

The Zlisseltoe Bough. 
The misseltoe hung in the castle hall, 
The holly-branch shone on the old oak wall, 
And the Baron's retainers were blithe and gay, 
Keeping their Christmas holiday. 
The Baron beheld with a 
father's pride 
His beautiful child young Lovel's bride; 
While she with her bright eyes seemed to be 
The star of the goodly company. 
Oh! the misseltoe bough. 
I'm weary of dancing, now she cried; 
Here tarry a 
moment, I'll hide, I'll hide, 
And Lovell, be sure thou'rt the first to trace 
The clue to my secret lurking place. 
Away she ran, and her friends began 
Each tower to search and each nook to scan. 
And young Lovell cried, 0, where dost thou hide.? 
I'm alone without thee, my own dear bride. 
Oh! the misseltoe bough. 
They sought her that , night and they sought her 
next day, 
And they sought her in vain when a 
week passed 
away, 
In the highest, the lowest, the loneliest, spot, 
Young Lovell sought wildly, but:found-her mot; 
And years flew by; their grief at last 
Was told as a 
sorrowful tale long past ; 
And when Lovell appeared, the children cried, 
See the whole man weeps for his fairy bride. 
Oh! the misseltoe bough! 
At length an old chest that had long lain hid 
Was found in the castle. 
They raised the, lid. 
And a 
skeleton form lay mouldering! t'here, 
lathe bridal wreath of that lady fair. 
Oh, sad was her fate '•  
in sportive jest 
She hid from her lord in the old oak chest; 
It closed with a 
spring, and, dreadful dopm, 
The bride lay clasped in her living tomb. 
Oh! the misseltoe bough.

Song of the Haymakers. 
The noontide is hot, and our foreheads are brown, 
Our palms are all shining and hard, 
And close is our work with the wain and the fork, 
And but poor iS our daily reward. 
But there's joy in the sunshine, and mirth in the 
lark, 
That skims whistling way over head ; . 
Our spirits are light, though our skins may be 
dark, 
And there's peace with a 
meal of brown bread. 
We dwell in the meadows, and toil on the sod, 
Far away from the city's dull gloom, 
And more jolly are we, though in rags we may be, 
Then the pale faces o'er the loom. 
CHOR17S. 
Then a 
song and a 
cheer for a 
bonny green stack, 
Climbing up to the sun wide and high— 
For the pitchers and rakers, and merry haymakers, 
And the beautiful midsummer sky. 
Come forth gentle ladies—come forth, dainty sirs, 
And lend us your presence awhile; 
Your garments will gather no stain from the burrs, 
And a 
freckle won't tarnish your smile. 
Our carpet's more soft for your delicate feet 
Than the pile of your velveted floor, 
And the scent of our greensward is surely as 
sweet 
As the perfume of Araby's shore. 
Come forth, noble masters, come forth to the field, 
Where freshness and health may be found, 
Where the wind-rows are spread for the butterfly's 
bed 
And the clover-bloom falleth around.

spreading chestnut-tree, 
The village smithy stands; 
The smith, a 
mighty man is he, 
With large and sinewy hands; 
And the muscles of his brawny arms 
Are strong as iron bands. 
His hair is crisp, and black, and long, 
His face is like the tan ; 
His brow is wet with honest sweat : 
He earns what'er he can, 
And looks the whole world in the face, 
For he owes not any man. 
Week in, week out, from morn till night, 
You can hear his bellows blow : 
You can hear him swing his heavy sledge, 
With measured beat and slow, 
Like a 
sexton ringing the village bells, 
When the evening sun is low. 
And children coming home from school, 
The Surf Skiff: Or, the Heroine of the Kennebec. 
One of Professor Ingraham's greatest stories of the sea.

Look in at the open door; 
They love to see the flaming forge, 
And hear the bellows roar, 
And catch the burning sparks that fly 
Like chaff from a 
thrashing-floor. 
He goes on Sunday to the church, 
And sits among the boys; 
He hears the parson pray and preach, 
He hears his daughter's voice 
Singing in the village choir, 
And it makes his heart rejoice. 
It sounds to him like her mother's voice, 
Singing in Paradise I 
He needs must think of her once more, 
Now in the grave she lies: 
And with hard rough hand 
lie wipes a 
tear out of his eyes. 
Toiling, rejoicing, sorrowing, 
Onward through life he goes,— 
Each morning sees some task begun, 
Each evening sees its close ; 
Something attempted, something done, 
Has earned a 
night's repose.

The Telegraph Girl in Nassau Street. 
There's a 
very nice school of girls in town, 
Who work the telegraph ; 
They are very peculiar in their way, 
And all day sing and laugh; 
For they sit in front of a 
wire machine, 
With a 
han'lle in each hand. 
These pretty little dears send twenty words, 
For two shillings through the land.

All day they sing and laugh, 
With a 
click, click, click, 
And a 
tap, tap, tap, 
As they work at the telegraph. 
I 
was particularly attached to one of these, 
As that you plainly see; 
I 
was struck right thro' my heart and pluck, 
But she didn't care a -- for me. • 
For I 
went one day into Nassau Street, 
To telegraph out of town, 
And quite forgot my business, • 
When I 
saw this girl in brown. 
SPOKEN. 
By jove, she was a 
girl in brown, and no mis-
take! none of your shilling a 
yard. 
And as she 
sat, my heart went pit pat, when I 
heard that 
Tap, tap, tap, Sr.c. 
I 
said, my dear, will you telegraph, 
But I've quite forgotten where, 
Just name all the towns in Illinois, 
She gave me such a 
stare, 
Which made things worse, for I 
saw her eyes, 
Which shone like stars above: 
So I 
said, telegraph to your ma, dear, 
And say I've fallen in love. 
SPOKEN. 
I had too and no mistake. I 
felt I 
was doing 
the cure upside down, especially when she turned 
round and left off that 
Tap, tap, tap, &c. 
The hint she took, she smiled on me, 
For weeks I 
saw her home— 
For when you could wed such a 
beauty, 
Why, who would live alone.

So I 
said, what say, will you name the day, 
At the altar be my pet, 
Said she the halter that you'll know, 
Is one put round your neck. 
SPOKEN. 
The devil did she take me for a 
donkey, or for a 
candidate for Sing-Sing ; no matter, I 
loves her, and 
I 
wouldn't takes the sack, a 
fellow's a 
fool if he 
does. 
I 
couldn't leave her, and I 
likes to hear her 
Click, click, click, &c. 
To a 
telegraph man in Bloomington, 
On the wires she sent her heart, 
They vow'd and swore by telegraph, 
For life they'd never part; 
Sho never seen him, and all her life 
She had his photograph, 
And all spare time this couple had, 
They'd make love by telegraph. 
SPOKEN. 
A 
very warm way to make love, no doubt, but I 
suppose he must of wired in and got his name up, 
and wired her out. 
But drink success to the girl 
in brown.

The portals of the east divide; 
The orient dawn is just descried, 
Mild and grey: 
The starry fires elude the sight; 
The shadows fly before the light 
Far away.

Now hark 1 
the woodland haunt is found! 
For now the merry bugles sound 
Their sylvan lay: 
As each sweet measure floats along, 
Sweet echo wakes her mimic song 
Far away. 
The stag now rous'd right onward speeds; 
O'er hill and dale, o'er moor and meads 
He's fain to stray: 
His flight the shouting peasants view 
'Rig 
steps the dashing hounds pursue 
Far away. 
All day untir'd his route we trace; 
Exulting in the joyous chase 
Of such a 
day I 
At length, at mild eve's twilightxleam 
He's taken in the valley stream 
Far away.

The Fairy Tempter. 
A fair girl was sitting beneath the greenwood 
shade, 
Listening to the music the spring birds made, 
When sweeter by far than the birds on the tree, 
A voice murmured near her, oh come love with 
me, 
A voice murmured near her, oh come love with 
me, 
In Rarth or Air a 
form so fair I 
have not seen as 
thee, 
Then come love, oh come love, come love with me. 
Then come love, oh come love, come love with me.

With a 
star for thy home, in a 
palace of light, 
Thou wilt add fresh grace to the beauty of night, 
Or if wealth be thy wish I 
have treasures untold, 
I'll show thee the birthplace of jewels and gold, 
I'll show thee the birth-place of jewels and gold, 
And pearly eaves beneath the waves, all these, all 
these are thine, 
If thou wilt be mine, if thou wilt be mine„ 
If thou wilt be mine, if thou wilt be mine. 
Thus whispered a 
fairy to tempt a 
young girl, 
But vain was his promise of gold and pearl, 
For she said tho' thy gifts to a 
poor girl be dear, 
My father, my mother, my sisters are here, 
My father, my mother, my sisters are here. 
Oh, what would be thy gifts to me, on Earth, or 
Sea, or Air, 
If my heart were not there, if my heart were not 
there ? 
If my heart were not there, if my heart were not 
there. 
The Night When First We , Met. 
AIR—The " Wreath of Roses." 
She ate six dozen oysters 
The night when first we met, 
With soft-shell crabs and lush, 
Besides a 
lot of heavy wet. 
Her body had no lightness, 
She weighed full forty stone, 
The token of the lots of grub 
With which she had been blown. 
I 
saw her but a 
moment, 
I 
think I 
see her now, 
A 
setting in that oyster box 
With her hair all on her brow.

Six plates of meat and potatoes 
She ate when next we met, 
The expression she made use of 
I 
never shall forget ; 
And standing by her side, was one 
Who, 
strove though all in vain, 
get the money for the grub, 
He ne'er would see again. 
I 
saw her but a 
moment, 
I 
think I 
see her now, 
Being lugg'd off by two Policemen, 
Kicking up a 
jolly row. 
When next again I 
saw that lass, 
No ringlets then were there 
For she had had the county crop, 
And a 
month to grind the air; 
She passed her time right gaily, 
And once more she is free, 
She'd been and joined the temperance, 
And means to live on tea. 
I 
saw her but a 
moment, 
Methinks I 
see her now, 
Standing on a 
chair and preaching, 
With a 
false front on her brow.

The Three Pest Irish Romances ever Mitten, 
PRICE TWENTY-FIVE CENTS EACH-
TEIE =
1\TI.A..1\T ; 
OR, THE MARTYR OF '55. 
. 
This book describes, most graphically, the bold attempt of a 
young, ardent, whole-souled Irishman to assist in freeing his native 
land. 
Mingled with the exciting incidents now progressing in the 
Green Isle, through the efforts of the powerful organization, Fenian-
ism, are some of the most pathetic love passages ever portrayed; 
while they in their turn, are chequered by descriptions of rich and 
racy drollery. 
This is a 
book that would find hosts of readers at any 
time—now it will be read by almost everybody.

OR, THE BOULD BOY OF GLENGALL. 
The very title of this book explains its scope and nature. The 
young hero, O'Brien, lives and will ever live in the hearts of his 
countrymen while the green triple-leaved type of immortality and the 
trinity carpets the sod of Old Ireland. 
In this book, the author has 
contrived to give us one of the best books we have ever read in many 
years. 
It is full of stirring incident, of marked character, drawing, 
and the plot is full of rare interest.

OR, THE WICKLOW WEDDING. 
[Founded on the celebrated play, by Dion Doreecault, now performing in the Milted 
States, Great Britain, and Australia.] 
The verdict of tens of thousands of unbiased spectators have 
pronounced this play ( and consequently this story formed upon it), 
to be one of the most natural and affecting pieces ever produced. 
Never for an instant overstepping the probabilities of real life, it ex-
ceeds in the power of affecting the feelings the most labored produc-
tions of the greatest writers. 
The lovely, artless heroine, Arrah 
Meelish, might stand for the embodiment of the pret ,-y, true-hearted 
Irish girl; while Shaun of the Post, is a 
capital type if the peasant 
class: here too, we have a 
life-like picture of the infernal " informer," 
that creature who has blighted the hopes of Erin's truest sons, and 
crimsoned the scaffold with patriot blood. Nor are there wanting 
other and capital characters to enliven and lend interest to the pages 
of " Arrah-na-Pogue," and make every gratified reader wish they 
might be 'present, and join in a 
jig at the next " Wicklow Wedding."
