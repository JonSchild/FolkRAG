T:  Well I guess.  Let me put the date on here.  Today's the twenty-first of August ah, 1987 in 
Newton.  The Name of the church is ah (--)
F:  Our Lady Help of Christians.  
T:  Our Lady Help of Christians.  Um, I guess what I, before we talk specifically about the Acre, 
if you could talk a little bit about just general biographical background and how you got to 
Lowell originally.  Um, are you from Massachusetts? 
F:  I'm from Massachusetts.  I ah, grew up in Boston.  Went to school in Boston.  Ah, studied in 
the Seminary in Boston.  And I've had assignments in Weymouth on the South Shore, Quincy on 
the South Shore, Framingham ah, I was assigned in Hyde Park which is part of the City of 
Boston during the bussing crisis.  
T:  [laugh].  
F:  And ah, then I'd left Hyde Park and was going into Jamaica Plane.  I was there about a month.
It was a racily mixed parish.  It was half Spanish, half ah, English speaking.  And I wanted to try 
a multi-ethnic parish.  I thought, I had some ideas, and I thought I could make them work.  And I 
was there about a month when I got a call to go up to Lowell as the administrator of Saint 
Patrick's.  The pastor there had been sick.  He had run into a lot of problems and, so I originally 
went as administrator of the parish.  And then ah, after a couple of years the pastor retired and ah,
I became the pastor.  
T:  How long were you there in Lowell? 
F:  Seven years.
T:  Seven years, and so two as the administrator and five as the pastor.  
F:  Right.  
T:  What ah, did you, you say that you wanted to ah, have a multi-ethnic parish and try some 
things out.  What were some of your notions before you went?  The kinds of things you wanted 
to try out?
F:  Well, I went to Jamaica Plain.  The idea was to run a bilingual parish.  If it was possible.  So 
your, your teaching program would be bilingual.  Your liturgy program would be bilingual so you
could bring the two communities together as a single community.  But preserving their own 
cultures.  Ah, I had no idea what Lowell was like when I went there.  It was my first time in 
Lowell.  And ah, when I got there ah, the Spanish Apostate in the city was all mixed up.  And the 
Asians had just started moving in about the same time that I came.  As it turned out many of 
them moved into our neighborhood.  So that took care of my ideas of (--)
T:  [laughter] bilingual.  
F:  It just meant you know deal with the situation as you find it.  And that's the situation I found.
T:  Ah, ha.  What ah, if you were, one thing I wanted to ask you is, if you were going to describe 
the Acre now to somebody who doesn't know anything about it.  How would you characterize it?
Both as a, you know as a graphic place and then the kinds of people that live there.  
F:  Well, the Acre if you say stretch a little beyond the Acre.  I'm told that the neighborhood 
which is the one mile radius of City Hall.  O.K. which would include the Acre maybe some other
little neighborhoods.  But that one mile radius is the most ethnically diverse neighborhood in the 
country.  This is what I'm told by sociologists.  And ah, so right away if you take that 
neighborhood which again is the Acre you have a lot of ethnic diversity.  And that's on the broad 
basis.  Now if you take a look at the people who are there.  Ah, one of the strange, one of the 
different ah, and actually a positive thing is that there's no such thing as Turf in Lowell.  Nobody 
has their own Turf.  So when all these different groups come in they don't have to fight for their 
Turf.  Which you'd have in places like Boston.  Where you'd have an Italian neighborhood, an 
Irish neighborhood and so on and so on.  Everybody fights for their Turf.  
T:  Right.
F:  You don't get that in Lowell.  So, people mix because everybody there was a immigrant, or 
they were descended from immigrants and they remembered where they came from.  So their 
attitude towards new peoples was different from what you might find say in other 
neighborhoods.  Now, give you an example.  I could open a window in the summertime and from
my room I could hear Greek, French, Spanish, English, Laotian, Cambodian being spoken on the
street.  And I can remember one day looking out the window and I heard these different 
languages, and it was a Puerto-Rican man who had the hood open on his car and ah, I'm not sure 
who's car it was.  But there was a Puerto-Rican and an Asian trying to fix a car together and they 
couldn't speak to each other.
T:  [Laughter].
F:  [Laughter].  They couldn't speak to each other but they were managing.  So it's things like 
that, that you'd see.  You probably wouldn't see anywhere else.  
T:  How did you adjust, or did you adjust the way that you pastor ah, to meet all those different 
needs?
F:  Ah, first thing we try to do is build the spirit in the parish.  Because the parish had been on the
down.  And ah, once you've built the spirit, and that meant, you know people coming together 
and doing things together.  That was the main thing.  And then we tried to have the parish do 
things that had some sort of a public ah, aspect to it.  For example, we ah, have a lot of elderly in 
the neighborhood.  So we had a mass, we did it three summers I think.  And we did it right in the 
housing project.  Right in the playground, outdoors, in the summer.  And we had about a 
thousand elderly there.  
T:  Good grief.
F:  And we had the cardinal come up and, so this got a lot of publicity.  So they see that the 
parish is doing things and it builds the spirit.  And it also shows that we're taking an interest in 
the elderly.  Then to raise money we had a carnival.  And we did that right in the middle of the 
housing project.  An people said (--).
T:  On the North Common?
F:  On the North Common.  People said your crazy.  You'll have all kinds of problems with all 
those different nationalities.  We never had a problem.
T:  Yeah.
F:  They just mixed.  They had a good time.  And people could see that you could do things in 
the Acre and have no trouble.  Ah, we did a multi-ethnic block party between St. Patrick's and the
Greek Church.  We blocked off the streets.  And we had ah, I think about six different 
nationalities.  They each had their own food tents.  And we had pony rides for the kids.  And 
things like that.  We also had ethnic dancing all afternoon.  So again it brought people together.  
It showed that there was an interest.  Now what that was doing is building up the spirit in the 
parish.  It was also getting us involved with other ethnic groups.  And then you know as people 
ran into problems they knew that the ah, parish there at St. Patrick's had a history of helping 
people out.  Because there are needs obviously in that area.  And ah, people just started coming.  
Ah, you know could you help me with this?  Could you help me with that?  Or they could see 
that we would be helping somebody with ah, say a new family would move in and we had this 
old beat up truck that somebody gave us.  And we'd be taking furniture out to somebody's house. 
And then the next thing they had three or four friends and the whole thing built up to ah, you 
know we had it all on the computer.  And we had about four hundred families ah, half Asian ah, 
half neighborhood Spanish and American.  And ah, whenever we had lots of cloths we'd send a 
mailing out and we'd sell the cloths for ten cents.  Or we used to buy mattresses three four 
hundred at a time.  And it just built up into a regular out reach program.  
T:  Did, did you often get those same families, did they start attending services?  
F:  No.
T:  No.  
F:  The intention ah, behind it was not to try to get people into the church.  Ah, and that we did 
consciously because some of the churches were doing that.  You know helping people out in 
return for their support.  
T:  Right.
F:  We felt that ah, as a parish if we could help the neighborhood no matter what it was.  You try 
to do that because you know, that's the Christian thing to do.  And we expected nothing in return. 
We try not to give out anything for nothing.  If, if somebody had ah, only a dollar and they 
needed four mattresses well, you know, we'd give them the four mattresses for a dollar.  If 
somebody had no money and needed cloths we'd give them the money and say O.K.  now go in 
and buy the cloths.  O.K.  just so ah, the idea was really to ah, show that the church was 
interested in folks and we didn't expect anything in return and, as it happened they saw that we 
were interested and ah, now the parochial school there must have at least twenty Asian families 
who have put their kids in the school.  Some Buddhist some Catholic but we never you know (--)
T:  Is that rare that a pastor would not ah, a Catholic pastor would not at least hope or even 
encourage people to come to church after receiving help?                                                     
F:  Well it's ah, the idea of why do you want people to join your church, you want them to join 
your church because they believe what you believe.  But ah, you know we don't restrict helping 
people based on what you believe.  And the same with ah, school we felt that we gave a good 
education and that was, if the room was there it was open to anyone who believed in that value.  
So no matter what your religious background if you believed in the value that we had then fine 
you were welcome to take part.  We just felt that ah, down the road maybe the next generation 
ah, people would remember who helped them out and maybe then they would take an interest.  
But we don't want to have people join the church just because they got six mattresses for their 
kids.  
T:  Yeah.  That makes a lot of sense.  
F:  That's not a good reason.  
T:  Right.
F:  But the attitude ah, you know the message we wanted to send out.  As long as they got the 
message then a lot of people came to that church to get help.  Didn't know wether it was a 
Catholic Church or what it was.  The Buddhist now especially because, that's foreign to their 
thinking.  They wouldn't (--)
T:  Right, right.  Yeah.  When you first came there you said it was on the down.  Was the 
congregation getting smaller.  
F:  Oh, yeah.  We were down to ah, maybe six hundred families.  
T:  And what about when you left?  
F:  Ah, we had probably more families on the actual census.  But again the neighborhood was 
changing.  So that if you did a study on that neighborhood in 19 ah, say 1980 and you made the 
same study in 1987 you'd find probably the same number of people, the same number of 
pre-school aged children, but the ethnic background would be totally different.  
T:  Ah, ha.
F:  So we could see that our neighborhood at least as I saw it.  And our school as I saw it was 
going to be predominantly ah, an Asian community of young people five more years down the 
road or whatever.  So what helped us to survive we're people who had been born and brought up 
in the parish.  Had maybe moved to another parish but, they learned about what we were doing, 
they liked that so they came to mass there all the time.  Even though they may never have 
formally joined the parish.  So that was helping us to survive.  But we, we didn't use the upper 
church at all except for major celebrations.  Christmas, Easter, Conformation because we just, it 
was too cold.  We didn't have enough people.  And so we went down stairs and ah (--)
T:  Did you have any, what kind of help did you have pastoring the church?  Did you, was there 
an assistant?  
F:  There was an associate with me.  Yeah.  Fr. Dan O'Connell, he's still there.
T:  Still there, right, right.  And then the fellow that took your place ah, Thomas (--)
F:  Powers.  
T:  Powers, yeah.  I haven't met him but (--)
F:  Then we had you know a lot of lay people that ah, would get involved.  As far as fund raising 
ah, visiting shut-ins ah, teaching in the religious programs.  You know, the people there are, are 
down to earth.  You've met a lot of them.  There down to earth, there honest to God people and 
ah, you ask them a question you get a straight answer no bologna.
T:  Right.  [Laughter].
F:  They like what your doing they'll tell you.  If they don't like what your doing they'll tell you.  
And that's ah, so there city people and ah, there's no veneer and there's no front.  It's just pretty 
much straight forward.  
T:  Are you happier in that kind of situation as a pastor in this kind of, outreach where there's a 
lot of need for being creative and serving the community?  
F:  I enjoy it, yeah.  I get a kick out of it.  We, you tend to get ah, in a situation like that, he 
tendency is that you can't separate your parish or your neighborhood problem from a city wide 
problem.  For example we used to deal with a lot of homeless people.  And we'd be putting them 
up in motels over night.  Sometimes a whole family.  And we realized if three or four parishes 
are doing this and some of the protestant churches are doing the same thing that we've got to get 
together and (--)
T:  Right.
F:  Deal with the problem as a city wide problem.  And ah, so this is what would develop ah, you
know highlighting ethnic diversity and the value of it ah, you know you don't do that by yourself.
So you involve the Greek Church and ah, the others get involved.  The next thing you know you 
have a community wide thing going.  At least a neighborhood wide.  Where you've got other 
groups involved.  
T:  Did you have good co-operation from other churches on that?  Ah, it sometimes depends on 
who happens to be in charge at the time.  So one year you might have good co-operation and the 
next year they might let you down.  
T:  Not so good, yeah.  
F:  And it would depend ah, you know I was new in Lowell ah, you know they don't know me.  
And you come up with these crazy ideas and you know they get a little suspicious.  And once 
they see you operate and get to know you then you don't usually have too much difficulty.  I 
never have problems with the city.  The city was always supportive.  And I think that the city felt 
that ah, a lot of the neighborhood leadership was coming out of the churches.  So the more they 
got involved with their neighborhoods ah, the closer they were to the leadership within the 
community.  So if problems came up it worked the other way.  The city could come and say O.K.
we have this problem.  You know can you people help us with this problem?  
T:  You said that ah, you mentioned just a minute ago that the value of ethnic diversity, talk, 
could you talk about that?  And just about how you see that as a positive thing?  Because there 
are people that don't see it that way.  
F:  Well, you know, I don't read Daniel Patrick Moynihan.  I haven't read him for years but, ah, 
way back he had some good ideas.  And as I say I haven't just, not because I don't like him.  It's 
just that I haven't kept up with him.  The whole question of the melting pot, is there such a thing 
that exists?  And it probably doesn't.  And it's probably not a good idea ah, to have a melting pot. 
You know having seen the experience of Lowell.  That the cultures of different people you know 
have a lot of positive value.  Simple example would be.  Ah, the strength of family in the Asian 
communities.  Ah, the respect for elderly.  All right.  we can learn from that.  The ah, the Italians 
always had this thing about you know they spoil their kids.  But at the same time the father rules.
You know, so they'll give the kids everything but the father will rule.  And ah, coming from an 
Irish background.  You know I'm second generation.  But, you know a lot of, and you see this 
with the Asian kids up there now who are teenagers.  You can look at an Asian kid who's a 
teenager.  And by the way there dressed you can tell how long they've been in the country.  
T:  Is that right?  
F:  If a girl is wearing the slacks and she's got the long hair and the make-up.  She's been here 
five years.  If she's wearing a sarong she's only been here less than a year.  O.K.  And ah, you 
know that these teenagers are adapting because they don't want to be identified.  They want to 
you know it's a typical teenage thing.  Am, so you know what happened I think to the Irish was 
we ,lost the heritage we had.  One of the problems I think of the Catholic Church in the United 
States is because we wanted to be a melting pot we never kept any of these quote, traditions of a 
single culture.  So now you put up a Christmas tree nobody knows where that comes from.     
T:  Yeah.
F:  It's not American.  It's European.  And the asians have to maintain these, these traditions that 
they have.  The Greeks have maintained theirs because they had the church and they had school 
that kept that going.  And they constantly had people coming in.  But ah, you know the Catholic 
Church as such does not have any quote Native American Customs.  Cause there only around 
two hundred years.  So ah, but ah, the diversity is good.  And it ah, there are a lot of built in 
values to it that are good.  We can learn from these other cultures.  
T:  One of the ah, we were last night.  There's a Puerto Rican Festival on the North Common 
now.  Ah, for the next couple of days.  And we were there last night recording some of the Puerto
Rican music.  And it's interesting there's, the one, I've only been in Lowell now for about a week.
So I can not speak but from a weeks experience.  But, the one group in Lowell that people seem 
ah, the least ah, positive about or anxious to help is the Puerto Ricans.  And we told some, as an 
example that, told people that we had been to this festival last night.  A completely  ah, safe, I 
mean there was nothing wrong with it as far as I could tell.  But people were just shocked that we
would go out you know till mid-night with this equipment walking around the North Common in
the midst of a Puerto Rican Festival.  And it seems like that the Spanish speaking, the Hispanic 
and particularly the Puerto Rican population in Lowell um, really has some problems.  In terms 
of, in the public eye.  And maybe there's, you know maybe there's good reason, maybe there's 
not.  I don't really know.  Did you experience that?  That peoples attitude towards (--)
F:  Mmm, yeah.  Well there's ah, probably a number of reasons.  And one would be that ah, the 
Spanish population that came to Lowell is the one group that never had their own church.  O.K., 
they never had their own clergy.  The Greeks, the Portuguese, Lithuanians go right down the line.
They always had their own church, their own clergy.  So you had a leadership problem for one 
thing.  Um, one of the ethnic groups that came to this city were never going to go home.  Or if 
they did it would be when they retire.  O.K.  Ah, the Puerto Ricans can go back and forth.  So 
they have their, and there citizens.  
T:  Right.
F:  So that I think they have their feet in both cultures.  Then the ah, take the Asian population 
that came to Lowell.  Ah, and you talk to them so you know their story and you know that there 
survivors.  They didn't just get on a plane.  O.K.  Now you take some of the Latin Americans 
there probably illegal aliens.  So they have to be very cautious.  O.K.  And then the Puerto 
Ricans that came ah, what was their background?  And ah, my suspicion without going too 
deeply into it is I think most of them came from an area called Comiario.  Which was a very 
economically low area.  So you had some of those families coming here who were on the fringe 
in Puerto Rico.  Where as your Columbians, Venezuelian that may not have been the case.  But 
the American in Lowell lumps all the Spanish together.  They used to lump all the Asians 
together.  But now there beginning to differentiate I would think.  
T:  Yeah, I've noticed that.  Yeah, they do.  
F:  Unfortunately even the Spanish don't get along with each other because it's two different 
cultures, the Latin American and the Puerto Rican.
T:  Right.
F:  So there are some problems there.  You don't have the same strong, you have, you don't have 
a strong nuclear family.  In the ah, in the Puerto Rican culture.  But you have a big extended 
family which is different from some of the other cultures.  
T:  Yeah, I've really noticed that tension.  And particularly I mean in the Acre and around the 
common.  Those projects that are heavily Hispanic and heavily Puerto Rican.  
F:  Yeah.  And then of course the drugs have always, always been associated with the ah, 
Spanish.  But ah, and the Spanish population in Lowell is decreasing.  And so the people buying 
drugs can't be all Spanish.  I mean there obviously people from all over the city.  I used to see 
brand new Cadillacs drive up there with dealer plates on them.  So your not, you know the 
people using the drugs aren't all Spanish.  It's just the Spanish maybe cornered the market on 
selling them.  
T:  Right, right.  Is it your sense that St. Patrick's will continue the kind of out reach ministry 
both church ministry and social ministry that you, or do you know?  
F:  That's hard to say.  
T:  Yeah.
F:  It's ah, I think ah, one of the things that happened ah, just as I left we had opened a store front
downtown.  For furniture, cloths, and things like that.  So wether that effects ah, how the parish 
is going to operate, I don't know.  Ah, I think, you know you still have to deal with ethnic 
diversity in an Irish parish.  As St. Patrick's is known as won't survive if they just become very 
insular.  I think you still have to be involved with you know community activity.  
T:  Yeah, it seems the only way to survive.  In that, is it a ah, is it call, do ministers, you know 
how long does one stay at a church?  I'm not as familiar.  Could you have stayed there the rest of 
your life if you wanted?  
F:  No.  The ah, Fr. Sarantos  has been at his church at Transfiguration for probably twenty-five 
years.  Fr. Gelopsous has been there for I don't know how many years.  Ah, our policy is your 
assigned for six years and then you can be reassigned for another six.  Or our maximum would 
be twelve.  But most of the Catholic Churches in Lowell as you probably learned by now are 
Oblate Parishes.  From the Oblate Mission Fathers.  Now their assignment is a three year term 
renewable for another three years.  So generally speaking ah, the Pastor would be there for only 
six years.  Now the other thing is the person is free to make a choice.  So you know, how long 
can you keep up with that kind of activity.  
T:  Did you find it tiering at some point?
F:  Oh! Yeah.  Absolutely.  I enjoyed it.  I enjoyed the work but, you know sometimes you can 
over extend it.  And then the other thing is you run out of ideas.  Either that or you have the ideas
and you keep trying them and for some reason or other you never put the thing together.  We had 
worked for ah, like three years to set up cooperative housing.  And never got it off the ground.  I 
mean the housing market just went out of sight.  And we had hoped to set up ah, a model 
cooperative housing unit.  It would be maybe six to ten families, Asian families.  Bring them in.  
Get them into quick home owner ship.  Let this be a ah, a model for the rest of the city.  And part 
of the idea was not on, not just to help immigrant families but also to counteract the gouging that 
was going on by some of the landlords.  So the thing is if we could get people to own their own 
property quickly then you'd be counteracting what these landlords were doing.  
T:  Ah ha, which is essentially keeping them paying rent for long periods (--)
F:  Exorbitant rates, over crowded apartment units.  Ah, poor maintenance and the problem with 
some of the immigrants was if, if ah, they didn't have a place to live then they moved two 
families together.  All right now even though the family knew this was going on he wouldn't 
complain because he was charging them by the person.  
T:  Charging by the person.  
F:  Oh, in some cases sure.  Then the tenant couldn't complain because, couldn't complain about 
the housing code violations because if they complained the landlord would throw them all out.  
So it was a Catch-22 situation.  
T:Good grief.  Were those absentee landlords?  Or were those people in Lowell?  
F:  Well they lived in Lowell but they didn't live in those buildings.  So the cooperative housing 
thing would get around that.  You know 60% of the families in that the owners would have to 
live there.  But they would own the whole thing.  And we thought it was a good idea.  We tried it.
We just couldn't find the right piece of property.  Or if we found the right piece of property the 
owner wasn't willing to ah, you know get into it.  
T:  Do you, is there sort of collision amongst some of those owners?  To keep(--)
F:  No.  I think there in it strictly for profit.  And ah, if they find they can make the profit, they 
don't care how they do it.  If they could sell the building they don't care who they sell it to.  As 
long as they make their profit.  Ah, the one, the best building we looked at in the neighborhood.  
Turned out that he was a, that he was a, one of the better landlords in the city.  Never had a 
problem.  He's never been in court.  But, his tax thing changed so drastically that he couldn't sell 
that building that year.  
T:  [Laughter]  Golly. 
F:  Ah, another building we looked at.  By the time we got through would have cost after fixing it
up, bringing it up to code and so on the cost of the building would be up to close to half a million
dollars in the Acre.  We just felt that that wasn't reasonable for nine families to get into that.  But 
again it was a case of every body in the city cooperated.  Ah, the people we had on that 
cooperative housing board were all very active and involved people in the city.  Both in 
government and outside of government.  Interested in the idea we just (--)
T:  Is that disbanded board at this point?  
F:  I don't know.  I ah, I haven't resigned.  I haven't had time to send a letters of resignation to all 
the committees I was on.  [laugh].  But ah what happened, the other thing that happened of 
course was that the homeless situation came up.  And we had to get at that right away.  And you 
know, somehow or other I got involved in that too.  So, a lot of the effort in the last two years up 
there was to the homeless situation.  
T:  Which seems to be a pretty, there seem to be quite a few homeless people.  And with 
development in Lowell the, redevelopment                          
of some parts of town they seem to be getting crowded into smaller and smaller places.  
F:  Yeah.  Well, it's a nice place to live.  
T:  Yeah.  
F:  I mean the Asian community will tell you that they would rather live there than Houston, ah 
Boston, anyplace.  Nobody bothers them in a sense you know some of the racial stuff that 
happens other places.  They can get jobs.  They have friends there.  The, the ah, city encourages 
the continuation of their culture.  I mean I think the school problem is probably over blown.  But 
ah, um, I mean it's probably one of the few cities around that has over crowded schools.  
T:  Yeah.
F:  I mean Newton's closed three junior high schools.  
T:  Is that right?  [laugh].
F:  There's no kids.  The school population in 9th, 8th, 7th grades is going down everywhere.  
Except perhaps in Lowell.  And it's just perhaps something they should have addressed and 
hadn't but ah, 
T:  well what do you ah, it seems, you've obviously switched to a very different parish.
F:  Yeah.  
T:  One that I assume these, if there's a balance between, or if there's, kind of a the social side of 
being a minister and a more church affiliated side.  In and outside the church you left with a lot 
more time for ah, church matters at this, here it seems.  
F:  That's what I thought.  
T:  Ah, ha.  [laughter].  
F:  Ah, here it turns out that the while the operating budget here would be probably a million and 
a quarter a year.  Which is I think up in Lowell it was around a quarter of a million at the most.  
Right.  Ah, the staff, the payroll here is ten times what it was up there.  And ah, it's just a very 
active place so they'd be less time to be involved with community issues here.  Here it's a case of 
believe it or not of almost survival.  Ah, what's coming in every week isn't making it.  
T:  Is that right?  
F:  Yeah, there's ah, so we have to cut expenses.  And all of a sudden try again to build ah, I 
thought, you know I felt it was time for a change.  And you know you like a little challenge.  You
don't want to go out to Beverly Farms or some place where you sit around and do nothing.  So it 
is a sort of a totally different situation in Lowell but, I find it's good to move around.       
                    
T:  Are you, here do you have, I noticed you all have a Thrift Store.  Do you have much out reach
for social (--) 
F:  Not that much.  
T:  Concern
F:  Yeah.
F:  Not that much.  No.  Newton is ah, Newton is called the Garden City.  It's probably one of the
more affluent cities in the Commonwealth.  And the population is decreasing.  And that's because
no one can afford to live here.  
T:  Yeah, right.  [laugh].  It seems pretty affluent.  Saw it when you drive around.  And this 
church looks at least from the street.  I mean physical it's a very impressive church.
F:  Yeah.  Well it's a city block in the front.  
T:  Yeah, I mean the buildings go on forever.  
F:  Yeah, but   
                        SIDE ONE COMES TO AN END
F:  I've forgotten his name.  But ah, he's done a whole study on the Irish in Lowell.  His uncle is 
Jim Heafy who's still (--)
T:  Heafy.
F:  Who still attends St. Patrick's.  Ah, Jim's nephew and I forget his name and I forget his name. 
Um, he's done a lot of studying on ah, Jackie Flood's been in the parish all his life.  He's, Jack's 
old Irish.  He's on Atlantic Street up at, in St. Margaret's Parish.  But he comes to Saint Patrick's. 
Jack is presently doing a study of nick names I believe.  Everybody in the Acre had a nickname.  
And another person you might want to talk too he's sort of a collector of things ah, is Billy King. 
Ah, Billy lives on Andover Street he grew up in the housing project next to the church.  And ah, 
he was out in Chicago and then he came back to Lowell.  And by choice he's remained there.  
He, he's the fellow who ah, could live anywhere he wanted to because company headquarters I 
think is Atlanta.  He chooses to live in Lowell.  
T:  So he's got his own business?  He's (--)
F:  No, he's a salesman.  I believe for a chemical company of some kind.  
T:  Oh, O.K.  Ah, ha.  
F:  And ah, but he loves Lowell.  
T:  O.K.  What about people in the South East Asian community?  Do you, did you get to know 
(--)
F:  Ah, yeah.  I'm sure you talked to Hi Pho.  Ah the ah, some of the ones that I dealt with 
originally Kum Sun Silavong.  I don't think Kum Sun is still around.  His wife, yeah, maybe he 
is.  Maybe he's just working different jobs.  I think she's active with ah the ah Laotian 
Community.  Ah, the one that I dealt mostly with was ah, Nguyen his three children are in the 
school.  He sang in the choir.  Van Nguyen he lives on I think it's Dane Street up near St. Joseph's
Hospital.  His three children are in the school.  He is ah, he writes a lot of music which they use 
in the Vietnamese Mass.  He's also the music director for the group.  And I believe right now he's
the vice-president of the Vietnamese Mutual Assistance Association.  And then there was ah, 
[laugh] ah, Mike So Mi, So Mi So Mong I believe his name is.  He used to go by Mike So Mi.  
Ah, his two boys are in the school.  And I co-signed a loan for him for the Mutual Assistance 
Association.  And the money went south some how or other and I almost ended up in court.  But 
ah,
T:  Really [laughter] 
F:  I don't know if Mike is still around.  But he was, when the groups first came the ones who 
had some facility with English became sort of the leaders of the communities.  Unfortunately in 
the Asian community you don't get the respect unless your an elder.  So even though these people
were the ah, leaders as the American community looked at them.  They were not necessarily 
excepted as the leaders by the ah, (--)
T:  By their own community.  
F:  By their own community.  Ah, the ah, so that was a little problem sometimes.  When you had 
a difficulty that you were trying to resolve.  And who would you go to see.  Ah, another one I 
used to deal with a lot was Sofi Yim in the Cambodian community [unclear] bought a house now
down near ah, it's off Chelmsford Street.  I think he bought a second house.  And ah, he's got 
two, two kids at the University of Lowell now.  And he's got one going to Parochial School.  He's
still, he's still Buddhist.  And he's got two in high school.  Very knowledgeable man.  
T:  How does he spell his name?  Do you know?  
F:  No.
T:  Oh, O.K.  
F:  I might even have it in my pocket.  Ah, he ah, [ Fr. Conway is unfolding a piece of paper.] 
Um, I used to have it written down.  They, they would know him in the community.  
T:  Do you have Tan Nguyen?  The fellow that the music (--)
F:  Yeah.  Van.  
T:  Van.
F:  Van Nguyen.  NGUYEN.  Ah, I don't have So Phi.  I don't have his name in here.  Ah, but 
anyone in the Cambodian community would know him.  Because he's been the vice-president of 
the association for a long time.  
T:  O.K.  
F:  They used to have their little informal meetings in the little play ground right across the street 
from the church.  Out on Cross Street there on Sunday afternoons.  You know they'd all be out 
there.  But So Phi worked for the Cambodian Bank and he was, he's the one that helps them with 
their finances.  And he has a plan sorted out, He showed me that ah, within three years you 
should own your own car.  And within five years you should have a down payment for a house.  
He came to me one day and said ah, I want you to help me buy a house.  So I said O.K.  What do
you want?  He said, I want a three family house with a two car garage, in a non-Spanish 
neighborhood, for $87,000.  I said, well So Phi that's the American Dream.  [laughter] 
Everybody wants the same thing.  He eventually got his house.  He got a two family house.  
That's how quickly you know (--)
T:  That's amazing.  I'd like to see that plan.  Because it must be (--)
F:  Yeah.  I'm sure he's adapted it.  But, he ah, I can't remember the name of the ah, but talk to 
somebody in the Cambodian community they'll tell you where he lives.  
T:  O.K.  You, is there a Vietnamese Mass at St. Patrick's?
F:  Yeah.  Saturday night.  Vietnamese and Cambodian, they may have switched the Cambodian 
Mass to Sunday.  See some of the Vietnamese were Catholic.  
T:  Ah, ha.  
F:  Ah, the Laotians, very, very few, I mean you could probably count them in the City of Lowell.
And strangely enough the Laotian community were all familiar with the Catholic Church 
because the missionaries had been there for so many years in Laos.  And most of the men had 
gone to Catholic Schools.  And yet none of them ever left Buddhism and became Catholic.  
Some of the Vietnamese did, very few Cambodians, there were some.   But Cambodians were 
more apt to join Christian Religions when they came here.  Why I don't know.  Mostly I think 
because they were never really trained in Buddhism.  They were never really taught because the 
Communists would of course get rid of all the Monks.  
T:  Right, right.
F:  But now that they have their own Temple ah, I think some of them have left these Christian 
Churches and returned to the Buddhist Temples.  
T:  To the Buddhist Temples .
F:  As a matter of fact their first services were held in the Acre on Franklin Street.  Up on the 
third floor of a building where they had the two Monks living.  
T:  Did you go to any services?  
F:  No, no I never did.  I probably should have.  
T:  I'm curious to go.  
F:  Nwrong Hull, Nwrong is a very active member of the Cambodian Community.  I believe 
Nwrong was the head of the Temple Association.  It was their responsibility to bring over the 
Monks, house them, feed them, cloth them, take care of their medical insurance.  And then set up
the Temple.  And Nwrong was very active with that.  Matter of fact he came to me and asked me 
about getting insurance.  [laugh] So we had, we had a good relationship.  And he came one day 
and asked me about buying a house in the Triangle.  Your familiar with the Triangle in the Acre? 
T:  Ah, ha.  
F:  I said, Nwrong your, the thing wouldn't last ten minutes if you bought it in there.  You know I 
think it's a little early for that.  It was very interesting to watch the development of 
neighborhoods.  Ah, because if you took the Triangle, all right, and you ah, sort of mapped it out 
until you had ah, say you had Cross Street, then you had ah, this would be you know Fletcher 
Street and up here you had Suffolk Street O.K.  Now everything in there was, was Spanish with a
few Americans.  On this side of Broadway was mostly Asians.  On Suffolk Street you had a mix. 
Then on Fletcher Street everything on this side was Spanish.  On this side ah, this is your going 
(--)
T:  The outside in.  
F:  From the outside.  It was, the Asians were starting from Broadway and moving down this 
way.  And the Spanish were this way on this end.  And eventually this became almost all Asian.  
The other side of the street strangely enough was a mixture of Spanish and American.  But then 
a, the first Asian family moved from one side of Broadway to the other.  And I was waiting to see
what was going to happen.  But now you find Asian families moving in.  So there in a sense 
infiltrating the Triangle.  So the Triangle will no longer be you know this particular ethnic group.
It will be a mix.  
T:  Right.  And where will the Spanish go if?  
F:  And another thing is that, that took place without any brawls.  Without any houses being 
burned and all that stuff.  Which is most unusual I think for a city.  It says a lot about the City of 
Lowell and the people that are there.  
T:  I think it does too.  Where will all the Spanish go do you think?  
F:  The Spanish seem to be moving to Lawrence.  I think there's probably more opportunity for 
them.  
T:  Ah, ha.  
F:  I don't know.  I don't know the reason behind it.  Ah, certainly the job market isn't that good in
Lawrence, but ah, there are more Spanish there.  There's probably less hassle there.  Ah, you 
know Lawrence probably should have a Spanish Mayor.  Or at least a couple of Spanish 
Aldermen.  And ah, they don't.  Even Lowell ah, you know there was a time when I spoke to a 
woman in the Triangle and I said to her, "you know, why don't you run for City Council?"  You 
know the Spanish should, see this is something they haven't done.  Every other group has done it 
and they haven't.  
T:  Right, right.  
F:  They don't have the same stability.  Ah, she eventually moved but ah, her husband owned a 
little store.  And I said, "look your respected in the community."  And you've been fighting 
against what's going on out here on Adams Street.  I said why don't you run?  Even if you don't 
win.  So what, you know at least, you know the Spanish are, are changing the image.  And she 
was afraid to do it.  Ah, but they eventually should do that.  It was interesting now when the ah, 
seat became open on the ah, Zoning  Board of Appeals that the City Manager choose a 
Cambodian.  
T:  Yeah.  
F:  And when he was criticize for it his answer was there are more Cambodians in the city than 
there are Spanish.  Because the Spanish said, "we've been here longer.  Why don't we have 
somebody?  " But he said that the numbers don't add up.  And ah, the other thing is I was on a 
committee for Gateway City Money and ah, [ Fr. Conway answers yes to someone at the door.  
Message is given but cannot be heard.  Fr. Conway replies ah, O.K.]  On the Gateway City 
Money and ah, we didn't want to get too big a committee.  But we wanted every ethnic group 
represented.  Right.  With the Cambodian, Vietnamese, Portuguese all the way down the line.  
There's no problem.  When you come to the Spanish the problem is who is the person who will 
speak for all the Spanish Community?  There's no, there isn't enough unity there?  
T:  Right.
F:  And we've, so we approached three different Spanish groups.  One religious, or maybe two of
them religious and one social.  And we said you know, here's some names.  Would you give us 
one name right.  And we finally got three to agree on one and that was the person that was put on
the committee.  We didn't have that problem with any other committees.
T:  What religious groups are there?  I'll let you, I know you've got somebody else.  
F:  He had no appointment.  
T:  One of the things that, that, because the Spanish Community is less organized or at least 
formally organized um, it's been harder to get a handle on but what, are there some Spanish 
Churches that would be worth looking into?  And Spanish religious leaders in the Acre 
particularly?  But in Lowell and, there seem to be a few store front churches I've passed but, and 
I don't know what, I assume there Catholic.    
F:  If I were to start I would go to the Spanish Center on Moody Street.  
T:  Moody?
F:  Moody Street it's down behind St. Jean Baptiste Church.  And ah, let's see their phone number
is [Fr. Conway is looking up the number.] I've got it here.  Ah, 459-7829.  And I think there are 
two priests and a brother.  And i think there are a couple of sister there who work with the 
Spanish community.  They could give you some background on, on ah, you know the different 
groups, what's happened to them.  Some of the history of ah, the Spanish in the city. 
T:  O.K., a certain, most of those Spanish come from, at least come from countries that are 
heavily Catholic.  And it surprises me a little bit that there not a, some kind of a Spanish Church. 
Or more of a Spanish Church.  
F:  Ah, the problem has been ah, like territory.  That their spread out in clusters all over the city.  
Like the Acre was, was Irish.  Then it was Greek.  Then it was French.  And ah, as a matter of 
fact the first French Mass in the City of Lowell was celebrated at Saint Patrick's Church.  All 
right.  That's the neighborhood they moved into.  The other thing is that the ah, the Spanish didn't
have a Spanish speaking, well they didn't have a Spanish Priest.  They had Priests that could 
speak Spanish.  
T:  Yeah, yeah, it's very different.
F:  But, it's yeah, there is a difference.  We're not into the culture.  
T:  Right.  
F:  Ah, the ah, the other thing is you, because nothing was organized they began to organize 
themselves.  And they ended up with three separate groups.  I think one of them even bought 
their own church.  
T:  Yeah, there's a church over in Centraville.  That is an old, that old Baptist Church.  That's got 
Spanish, well it's a Spanish Church now.  I don't know what goes on inside.  We may go Sunday 
and see.  It was a Baptist Church and it's a very dilapidated white wooden church that's got 
Spanish sign on it.  And it has mass.
F:  Yeah, there's a bunch of them around.  And ah, this group here on Moody Street they, they 
operate out of St. Jean Baptiste and Immaculate Conception.  
T:  O.K.  
F:  And then there was another one on Gorham Street but that, I think that was the one that they 
had bought.  I think that one has closed.  
T:  O.K.  The other thing I was going to ask you on that, we are going to be recording some 
services um, do you think, who should I talk about perhaps recording the Vietnamese Mass.  One
of the Vietnamese Masses.  
F:  Talk to Fr.  Anthony Nguyen.  N-G-U-Y-E-N, I guess Nguyen is like Smith in Vietnam.
T:  Right.
F:  Now, he's at St. Patrick's from Thursday through Saturday night.  Then he's in Chelsea the 
rest of the week.  He's the one that celebrates the Mass.
T:  O.K.  Think he'll have any problem with it.  
F:  Nah, they'd probably love it.  Because there's some great music.  Oh yeah, they oh, yeah.  For 
a small community they have a, he works hard with the Choir.  They practice, they bring in their 
own key board and, oh yeah.  
T:  Is it influenced by both the music of Vietnam and the music of, of American Catholic 
Church?       
F:  Nope, pretty much Vietnamese.
T:  Is that right? O.K.
F:  And yet ah, at Christmas and at Easter we'd put the two communities together.  So that our 
Mid-night Mass at ah, St. Patrick's, you know during the service they would sing ah, Silent 
Night, I think it was Silent Night.  They'd do it in English, Spanish, French, Vietnamese, Italian, 
all right a different verse ah, and I think at Easter this year, I think it was Easter the Vietnamese 
Choir joined our choir.  They sang some songs with the American Choir.  And then they did some
in Vietnamese.  And the community, you know the American Community there would except 
that.  
T:  That's interesting.  I'd like to see that.  O.K.  Well I appreciate your time.  I know you got 
many things to do here.  
F:  Yeah, but that was fun up there.  This, [ Both men laugh.] It was hard work but it was fun.  I 
don't have any truck to drive around with mattresses any more.  
T:  Right, yeah.  I'm surprised that, do you not have an administrative person here that does all 
your business? 
F:  No.  We  just, that's when you came in.  We were having a meeting talking about that.  But ah,
it's not really part of the, the tradition say of the Catholic Church.  It's becoming more so.  
Especially down south where you have one priest who would handle maybe three or four 
parishes so he has to have somebody in charge.  But we have to do it here because ah, we were 
five priests here um prior to my coming.  We were allowed five by the Dioceses.  We're being cut
to three.  So we're going to have to get people on board, yeah.  So we're ah, as soon as we can get
ah, the income and the right situation we're going to be looking for a business manager that 
would handle the books and then handle all the repairs.  
T:  Payroll and all that stuff.  That can get to be a big headache.  
F:  Oh, yeah.  This is, this is I think the third salesman today.  
T:  Oh, is that right? Golly, [ laughter.] I used to run an office.  I know there's nothing worse than
the salesman that would stop by.  
F:  Yeah.
T:  Because you have to be polite.  I mean you can't (--)
F:  Yeah, well what are you going to do.  
T:  Yeah, and they might have something you want.  You never know.  O.K.
F:  Well, you have an interesting project.  
T:  Well, I think it is going to be real good.
                         TAPE COMES TO AN END
