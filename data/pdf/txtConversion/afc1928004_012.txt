PUSH ALONG, KEEP MOVING. 
I 
am a 
man of learning, and the ladies say I'm 
pretty; 
A school I 
kept for many years in London's 
famous city; 
The Arts and Sciences I 
taught, though some-
what fond of roving, 
For this my motto always was, push along, keep 
moving. 
(Spoken in different voices.) 
How do ye do, 
old one ? 
My dear boy, how d'ye do ? 
What, a 
little instruction in bang up ? that don't come 
within the circle of sciences. 
Explain ! 
Oh, I 
only want to gammon the fiats. 
Now I 
have it; 
music—this is the science you want to learn. 
Do me the honor to become my pupil—I'll learn 
you to gammon the flats on the new principle of 
Push along, keep moving. 
A 
wife I 
had, and she was young; oh, think of 
wedlock's joys! 
She would not let me keep a 
school, because I 
whipped the boys; 
Says she, a doctor you shall be, your talents 
thus improving, 
And all your patients, by your drugs, shall 
push along, keep moving. 
(Spoken.) 
I 
want sum'at for my wife's infer-
nal parts, she has got the gripes. 
Oh, fie, Pm 
ashamed of you—your wife's complaint is in 
wardly. 
Yes, she has a 
pain in her head. 
A 
pain in her head! ahem. 
Come, tip, you under-
stand me ? 
Understand ye! yes, yes, there, now,

GUS SHAW'S 
transcribe. 
Eh ! what is this I behold ? 
A 
sovereign, as I 
hope for money—ay, this will do; 
now, friend, carry her that box of pills ; she must 
take fifteen of 'ern three times a 
day, for seven 
days ; they are infallible, and sure to make 
her 
Push along, keep moving. 
My doctor's shop Isom' gave up, as everybody's e 
ry 
Was, pray don't take the fellow's stuff, for if you 
do, you'll die ; 
I 
set up Baker in a 
trice, but was not long in 
proving 
A 
Baker shop would never do to push along, keep 
moving. 
(Spoken.) 
A two-penny loaf, sir. 
Here my 
little man. 
La, sir, it's very small ! 
You have 
the less to carry, my child. 
There's your mo-
ney-. 
Here's only three half-pence, you chap! 
You have the 
less 
to count, 
sir. 
If you 
please, sir, will you trust rile to a 
quartern loaf. 
No, I 
can't trust, that's not the way to 
Push along, keep moving. 
In vain I 
tried to get my bread by baking bread 
for others, 
Because I 
let it go on tick to the little children's 
mothers. 
A 
Chandler's shop at last I 
took ; my wife was 
very loving, 
Because it made both her and I 
to push along, 
keep moving. 
(Spoken.) 
I 
want a 
farthing's worth of salt. 
Can't make less than a 
ha'porth. 
Well, I 
must 
have that; got any paper ? 
Can't sell a 
ha'porth

of salt, and give paper, too. 
I 
say, old Bumble-
head, give us a 
pen'orth of bread, and a 
ha'porth 
of small beer? 
Here, here, vy, vat a rum gill 
you are! 
Tip us a 
pen'orth of that there cheese 
in your window. 
Come' none of your rum fun, 
stow your wits, and look sharp, for I 
vants to 
Push along, keep moving. 
TEE—TOTAL SOCIETY. 
I 
am come to exhort you so free, all you that so 
fond of the bottle are, 
And when you my arguments see, every one will 
become a 
tee-totaler; 
Of Gin, Brandy, Rum, Wine, or Beer, to drink is 
a 
great impropriety, 
Of such trash I 
would have you steer clear, and 
join the tee- total society. 
• 
An old man that was troubled with corns, that 
scarcely the stairs could he hobble up, 
lie used to drink beer out of horns, and all sorts 
of liquor would gobble up; 
His corns have all left one by one, and now 
he's the pink of sobriety ; 
And pray, how was all this done ? why he joined 
the tee-total society. 
T'other day my young pigs and old sow, I 
found 
to be far gone in liquor; 
In my family I 
this can't allow, to temperance 
being a 
sticker; 
They had with grain from the brewer been fed, 
but now they shall share in sobriety, 
Coffee grounds, and tea leaves instead, and they 
shall join the tee-total society.

GUS SHAW'S 
A tee-totaler t'other day died, the doctor his 
friend did entice out, 
Examined his. stomach inside, and they say took 
a 
large lump of ice out; 
This cannot be 
true, for if ever we're ill, of 
brandy we take a 
small moiety, 
And melt, you know, brandy it will, it has been 
tried by the tee- total society. 
I 
wander about doing good, our society pays all 
my charges, 
Preaching, two hours at least, to coal- heavers 
working on barges ; 
But they say if you carried our coals, of beer you 
would soon see the propriety, 
But ah! they are sad, wretched souls, they wont 
join the tee- total society. 
• 
Folks ask what makes my nose so red? I'll tell, 
and end all this puzzling, 
It aint drink what gets in my head, it's blush-
ing to see so much guzzling ; 
Drops of brandy we take, two or three, as medicine, 
and no impropriety, 
And put some in our gruel or tea, it's allowed by 
the tee-total society. 
The people laugh at me, oh dear, and put my 
mind, in sad order works, 
And cry out whenever I 
appear, how gets on the 
temperance water works ; 
But I 
tell them I 
don't care a 
dump, and preaches 
away on sobriety, 
And for example drink out of the pump, since I 
joined the tee-total society. 
NEW COMIC SONGS.

In our progress there's nothing excels, in our 
efforts we never do slumber, sir, 
We have dug six and fifty new wells, and erected 
of pumps a 
great number, sir ; 
I 
have some temperance tracts, of a 
most gratify-
ing variety, 
They record some wonderful facts about the tee-
total society. 
A 
drunken beggar I 
very well know, quite lame 
and as thin as a 
rat he was, 
Led by a 
dog he would go through the streets, for 
blind as a 
bat he was ; 
Yoa will scarce believe what I 
say, he's now the 
pink of sobriety, 
He's got fat, and can see clear as day, since he 
joined, the tee-total society. 
One night in my house every week, I 
hold forth 
on the beauties of temperance; 
Because when in public I 
speak, I'm subject to a 
good deal of imperence ; 
After a 
lecture, on coffee they sup, or tea if they 
like for variety, 
I 
charge a 
shilling a 
cup, since I 
joined the tee-
total society. 
CHAUNTING BENNY. No. 3.

DON'T BE ADDICTED TO DRINKING. 
As early one morning down the Bowery I 
walked, 
The sky being shady and clouded, 
All of a 
sudden my senses were shocked, 
Just to see how the Gin shops were crowded; 
The folks ran out and in, as if running a 
race, 
And they poured down the liquor like winking, 
A 
glass now and then, is very well in its place, 
But don't be addicted to drinking. 
Now these cold, frosty mornings, when raising 
your head 
From your pillow, you'll find it quite handy 
To knock off, as soon as you turn out of bed, 
A 
thumping good bumper of brandy; 
A 
tumbler of rum in a 
basin of tea, 
Is a 
very good thing to my thinking, 
Yet a 
pint of good liquor would better agree, 
But don't be addicted to drinking. 
A 
glass at eleven, I've heard some folks say, 
Is a 
very good thing; so it is, miss ; 
But a 
man should not drink every hour in the day, 
In case it unfits him for business ; 
• 
NEW COMIC SONGS.

Then about one o'clock, when your dinner you get, 
Your spirits at that time are most sinking, 
Take two or three glasses by the way of a 
wet, 
But don't be addicted to drinking. 
Enjoying a 
cigar after dinner, you get, 
Perhaps for an hour and a 
quarter, 
Nothing will give such a 
relish to it, 
As a 
tumbler of brandy and water; 
Then, perhaps, you will feel inclined, for a 
doze, 
You can scarce keep your eyelids from winking, 
Take three or four glasses your mind to compose, 
But don't be addicted to drinking. 
To think about business as soon as you wake, 
Of course you will think it about time, 
Then four or five glasses more at least you must 
take, 
If you wish to be sober by tea-time; 
• 
Then spending your evening at Liberty's Arms, 
Of your pretty fair maid you keep thinking, 
'While in hot gin and water you are toasting her 
charms, 
Mind you don't get addicted to drinking. 
Now a 
bumper at parting, you cannot do less, 
It will just keep you from yawning, 
But believe me, dear friends, if you drink to 
excess, 
You will have a devilish headache in the 
morning; 
Now such, my dear friends, is my own sober 
plan, 
And I 
hope you are my way of thinking, 
For I 
have just joined the temperance society, 
and am 
By no means addicted to drinking.

GETS SHAW'S 
THE YOUNG MAN BROWN. 
SUNG WITT' UNBOUNDED APPLAUSE. 
There was a 
nice young man, his name was Brown, 
He wore a 
short frock coat, 
The hair on his temples was plastered down, 
And his collar on the side of his throat; 
Oh, his hands they were white, his pants, they 
were tight, 
And his hair was the color of tan; 
The ladies all said, whether widow, wife, or maid, 
That he was such a 
nice young man. 
Ri tol, &c. 
This young man Brown spoke soft and low, 
And was civil to everybody ; 
The temperance pledge with him was all the go, 
For he never drank a 
glass of toddy ; 
At the name of a 
play he would run right away, 
For the playhouse was the devil's frying-pan ; 
He read nothing but tracts, and he stuck to them 
like wax, 
For he was such a 
nice young man. 
Ri tol, &c. 
Three times on a Sunday, and once a Sunday 
night, 
He went to church quite regular; 
He was so polite that he did not fall asleep quite, 
But sang hymns with a 
fat dowager 
Oh, he turned up his eyes, like a 
duck when he 
dies, • 
Blowed his nose when the sermon began, 
When the parson had done, to shake hands with 
him he'd run, 
And the parson said he was a 
nice young man. 
Ri tol, &c. 
NEW COMIC SONGS. 
21 
To a 
christening party Brown invited himself, 
And offered to stand God-pappy; 
There was none so fresh as he, when he handed 
round the tea, 
lie made them all so jovial and happy; 
He talked to the pappy, and kissed the little 
baby; 
Oh, the mother admired his plan; 
How beautiful he talks ! but where is all my 
silver forks ? 
They were in the pocket of the nice young 
man. 
Ri tol, &c. 
They took him off to the police office, 
And the first thing his worship said, 
Was, " we've been looking for you, for a 
year or 
two, 
And I 
am glad you have been discovered ;" 
In spite of his good looks, he was upon their bad 
books, 
They sent him off in the police black van; 
They did not stretch his wizen, but for two years 
in prison, 
They locked up the nice young man. 
Ri tol, &c. 
ENCORE VERSES. 
Brown served his time, and came out prime, 
And looked much nicer than ever; 
He just changed his name to play the same 
game, 
And alter the scene of his endeavor; 
22 
GCS SHAW'S 
Oh, he toddled out of town before he settled 
down, 
And followed the self same plan ; 
He looked wise and demure, as stiff as any 
skewer, 
And they all said he was a 
nice young man. 
RI tol, Sze. 
He found a 
gold watch in his landlord's room, 
And he took it right away ; 
For fear some one 
to 
steal it 
should 
pre-
sume, 
The landlord would be in a 
bad way; 
The landlord discharged his maid and his clerk, 
Thinking them in the stealing plan; 
If he had suspected Brown, he would have 
knocked him down, 
For suspecting such a 
nice young man. 
Ri tol, & c. 
In the course of his sinning he grew very short 
of linen, 
lie managed to drop into a dry goods dealer

The people grow worse every day ;

A

In love they both were pining ; 
The winds in gentle gales did blow, 
An April sun was shining. 
Though Simon long had courted Miss, 
He knew he'd acted wrong in 
Not having dared to steal a 
kiss, 
Which set her quite a 
longing.

It so occur'd as they did walk, 
And viewed each dale so flowery, 
As Simon by her side did stalk, 
Declared the sky looked showery ; 
The rain came to her like a

When loudly he did bellow, 
" 
Look here my love we can be snug, 
For I've got an umbrella."

Quick flew the shelter over Miss; 
Now Simon was a

So from her lips he stole one. 
She blushed; the rain left off, and he, 
The umbrella closed for draining ; 
" 
Oh, don't," says she, " I 
plainly see 
It has not left off raining."

Now Simon when he smoked the plan, 
The umbrella righted, 
Be grew quite bold, talked like a

And she seemed quite delighted; 
Their lips rang chimes full fifty times, 
Like simple lovers training ; 
Says she " these are but lovers' crimes. 
I 
hope it wont leave off raining."

He kissed out of her a 
consent, 
That she'd become his bride, hence, 
To buy the ring was his intent, 
And then to get the license; 
They parted; but he took much pains, 
Where they should meet to tell her, 
Says she " I'll meet when next it rains, 
So bring your umbrella."

John Jones was a 
farmer highly respectable, 
Always in spirits and never dejectable; 
One of those men who would never annoy himself, 
But over his pipe and his glass would enjoy 
himself; 
Ever found sober, disliking a 
dizziness, 
Raising each morning with a 
clear head for busi-
ness ; 
He honored his country as he loved to be national, 
And lived like a 
being disposed to be rational. 
John Jones had a wife who was pleasant in 
feature, 
A nice little woman, a 
good-hearted creature:

She'd good worldly wisdom, could shrewdly de-
feat a 
plan, 
In short just the woman who knew how to treat 
a 
man ; 
Children they had, too, all grown up and dutiful, 
Boys looking healthy, and girls looking beau-
tiful; 
Not a 
brow there was o'ercionded by wretchedness. 
But their fireside was the picture of happiness. 
Thus John loved his home, nor did his spirits 
sink at all, 
Till some one told John ' twas a 
sin for to drink 
at all; 
And though he never broke through the rules of 
sobriety, 
They got him to join the temperance society; 
John from his feelings would fain have evaded 
him, 
But the sanctified phiz of the fellow persuaded 
him; 
His wife ' gan to check him, but quick he did 
thwart her, 
And vowed from that time he'd drink nothing 
but water. 
If John met a 
friend he always took tea with 
him, 
Though be felt at the time it didn't agree with 
him; 
All grog he forsakes now, good home brewed, too, 
he leaves, 
To go home and smoke his pipe over his tea-
leaves ;

place in him,

Until she at length could no cheerfulness trace 
in him ; 
He got dull and mopish, drank slops to satiety, 
Which made 
the dame curse 
the 
tee- total 
society. 
The Winter came on, his great coat he looked 
thin in it, 
He still swallowed water without any gin in it ; 
The consequence was, though not given to larket-
ing, 
He died one cold night, after coming from mar-
keting; 
The wife, broken-hearted to find thus her joys 
end, 
Called in the doctors, declared he'd been poi-
soned ; 
His body they opened, and found besides blow 
galls, 
His inside was stuffed full of tea-leaves and snow-
balls. 
My moral is plain; had John lived and enjoyed 
himself, 
He had ne'er like a 
fool or madman destroyed 
himself; 
This proves then his folly, from nature he caught 
a 
rub, 
Through changing his stomach clean into a 
water 
tub; 
Since good liquor, doubtless, was sent for our 
uses, 
To gladden our hearts while we shun its abuses, 
May each tee-totalist freeze until ice he's a 
lump Of, 
For a 
man who drinks water, I'd have made a

'Tis a 
folly to think of life's troubles, 
There's always two sides of the way, 
If one be in shade, the chance doubles 
The other looks cheerful and gay; 
We know it looks sad to be sighing, 
Yet there's good in it, wisdom decides, 
For the man who with grief thinks he's dying, 
With laughter will ne'er crack his sides. 
'Tis a 
folly, &c. 
If a 
man all his teeth chance to lack, 
He's sure they wont give him no pain ; 
If a 
man has no coat to his back, 
He's sure it wont spoil with the rain ;

If a 
man has but one shirt at most, 
There's no trouble to think which he'll use, 
And the man who's deaf as a 
post, 
'Will never hear unwelcome news ; 
If light headed, why still we are right,

And the man who gets drunk day and night,

To be without hands, though no blessing,

Though awkward we find it when dressing, 
We ne'er can be in want of new gloves; 
To be without legs, though queer talking, 
We can ne'er break our shins it is plain,

to-night. 
Well, well, poor Murrough I 
now I 
am sorry for the loss of poor Murrough, for he 
was' a 
rale dacent, clean, and well behaved boy, 
and was a 
great ornament to me school, and I 
meet with a severe loss by the death of poor 
Murrough; but, poor boy, it wasn't his fault ; he 
couldn't help going to his long home ! and. now, 
master Shea, you be just after learning your 
letters, and don't be after going to sleep yourself, 
or I'll be after waking ye up with the stick I 
got 
in my fist. 
So long life to old Teddy, for he's always ready 
To kick up a 
row, or the whiskey to smack, 
Wid his eatin' an' drinking, and. birching and 
bating, 
his ubellu, tilleblu, row de doo, whack. 
Old Ted. had a 
nose as big as a 
tun, 
And a 
chin sure he had, an they war both one, 
A 
grin, too, he had, and if there was a'noise, 
he'd just give a squint, and he frightened the 
boys ; 
A 
fortune he had, sure it was his birch and his wig, 
A black ugly cow, and a 
dirty old pig, 
A 
tater plantation, a 
dog and a 
cat, 
And a 
head sure he had, which he kept inside a 
greasy old. hat.

O'Rourk, before you go down

say your letters ; now just be after taking your 
fingers out of your dirty head now, and stand 
up straight and say your letters correctly, and 
mind you that ; now what's that letter ?

his alphabit, and out of his own book too—why 
what do the horses eat ? 
They eat grass. 
Bad. 
luck to the grass ; and don't they eat anything 
besides grass. 
Yes, they eat hay. 
Well that's

That's a good boy, don't 
hurry, and take your time, and say them correct-

Why, what 
the divil are you been studying about all your life 
time ? 
Fighting. 
Oh, bad luck to the fighting, 
you just be after studying and learn your letters, 
or I 
will quickly be after fighting with you ; now 
what do I

You squint. 
Bad luck to the squinting part, and don't I 
do 
anything else. 
You C. 
Well, mind, that's C ; 
the next? 
D, E, F, G, H. 
Well, what the

Why, what has your mo-
ther got on the side of her nose ? 
A 
pimple, sir. 
Bad luck to the pimple, and aint she got any-
thing else ? 
She has one eye. 
Now don't be 
after going into figures, learn your letters before 
you go into figures, and say eye without the one. 
Eye without the one. 
The next ? 
J. 
Well, the 
next? 
Sure I 
don't know. 
Why, what the 
divil do you know ? why, you know nothing; 
what does your mother open the door with ? 
A

Bad luck to the poker, and don't she 
open it with anything else ? 
Yes, with a

Well, then, that's K ; the next then?

Why, bad luck to you, you

And what do you bother 
my brains about the letters for if you know your-
self. 
Oh, bad luck to you, you spalpeen; and 
aint it naeself that has to tache you your letters, 
so tell me what that letter is directly? 
And 
sure I 
don't know. 
Then take that into your 
thick head, you knave, and take that, and tell 
me where the bad people go when they die? 
Into their graves. 
Bad luck to the graves, don't 
the priest tell you different from that? 
Yes, 
they go to hell. 'Well, then that's L; and now 
as you have got as far as L, you just, be after 
going back to your seat, and learn your letters 
better and correctly for the next time you come 
up, and if you don't say your letters better and 
correctly for the next time, I'll just be after send-
ing you to L 
with this stick across your broad 
back, and into your thick head for you.

THE RAGGED COAT. 
Oh, what a 
world of flummery, there's nothing but 
deceit in it, 
So you will find through life, e'er as you travel 
on, 
Old and young, rich and poor, every" one you 
meet in it, 
'Tis the same I 
will maintain, and prove it in 
my song; 
When I 
was poor I 
found that friends seldom 
e'er did heed me, 
Till a 
rich one died, and left me cash, which set 
me all afloat,

So then I 
had. money, but I 
kept it quite a 
secret, 
And to fathom out deception I 
put on a 
ragged 
coat. 
I 
thought my friends I 
would try, as I 
had so 
many, 
At least so they professed to be; at Brooklyn, 
Mr. Ford; 
And as a 
trip by steamboat would be as cheap as 
any, 
I 
went down to the ferry-boat and quickly 
stepped on board ; 
When I 
heard a 
silly puppy say, though lowly 
he did breathe it, 
'Tis a 
shame to let a 
ragged man on board of a 
steamboat, 
Says I, you spoony rascal, there's a 
good heart 
that beats beneath it, 
Don't despise a 
man because he wears a 
ragged 
coat. 
My journey being ended, I 
placed my foot on 
shore, sirs, 
Glad enough I 
was of such a 
crew to get relief, 
I 
went to the house and knocked at the door, sirs, 
The people all kept eyeing me as though I 
was 
a 
thief; 
The door was banged against my face, with many 
a 
bitter snarl, sirs, 
When I 
shouted loud, good Mister Ford, I 
come 
to pay a 
note; 
I 
beg your pardon, sir, said he, come step into 
the parlor, 
We thought you were a 
begging, when we saw 
your ragged coat. 
!I

GUS SHAW'S 
A 
chair was quickly placed for me, and down I 
sat instanter, 
You have come from town you must be tired, 
pray stop here and dine, 
Jane bring the glasses, likewise the decanter, 
I 
think you will find that is most excellent 
port wine; 
Your wine you may keep, though I 
got this 
ragged dress on, 
I 
tell you what, I 
changed my mind, I 
mean 
to keep my note, 
And put it to some better use, so let this be a 
warning, 
Don't despise a man because he wears a 
ragged coat. 
Next I 
went a 
courting the brisk young widow 
Moore, sir, 
I 
went to the house and boldly proposed, 
My suit I 
pressed, but she exclaimed, pray show 
this knave the door, sir, 
At the sight of my appearance she soon turned 
up her nose; 
But when I 
showed my bag of gold, she fain 
would be a 
talker, 
At the sight of all my money she quickly 
changed her note, 
Says I, I'm off dear madam, ' tis true my name 
is Walker, 
Don't despise a man because he wears a 
ragged coat. 
Never trust to appearances, they often will de-
ceive you, 
'Tis not the gaudy peacock turns most faith-
ful bird,

NEW COMIC SONGS. 
'Tis 
not your wealthy relatives stand forward 
to relieve you, 
Trust not those who raise their nose, the 
thought is quite absurd; 
But when of those deceitful friends this country 
has a 
clearance, 
Down life's tide there's many a 
bark once 
more will proudly float, 
So mark my moral well, now don't trust to one's 
appearance, 
For there's many an honest heart beats beneath 
a 
ragged coat.
