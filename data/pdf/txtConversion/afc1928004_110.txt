Swinging in the Lane. 
How oft we talked of childhood's joys, 
Of tricks we used to play 
Upon each other, while at school, 
To pass the time away 
But, oh! how often have I 
longed 
For those bright days again, 
When little rosy Nell and I 
Went swinging in the lane! 
CHORUS. 
But yet I'd give the world to be 
With rosy Nell again. 
I 
never, never will forget 
Our swinging in the lane! 
The boys and girls would often go 
A-fishing in the brooks, 
With spool af thread for fishing-lines, 
And beaded pins for hooks; 
They, some times, wished me with them, but 
They, always, wished in vain: 
I'd rather be with rosy Nell, 
A-swinging in the lane.

But soon a 
cloul of sorrow came— 
A 
strimle young man, from town, 
Was introduced to rosy Nell 
By Aunt Jemima Brown, 
She stayed away from school next day— 
The truth to me was plain— 
She'd gone with that old city chap, 
A-swinging in the lane! 
But yet, &c. 
Now, all young men with tender hearts, 
Pray take advice from me; 
Don't be too quick to fall in love 
With every girl you see; 
For, if you do, you soon will find 
You've only loved in vain; 
She'll go off with some other chap, 
A-swinging in the lane!

He was once mild, young, and gay-hearted, 
First in the frolic of market or fair; 
Where are the cheeks when the smile has de 
parted ? 
Others may revel, but he cannot share; 
Bright are the eyes that around him are beaming. 
Cold is the heart that strives to adhere. 
Save when at night on the past he is thinking. 
Why did she leave him ?—because he was poor. 
Now she rides lily in pride and her carriage; 
Put where is the bloom that once shone on her 
cheek ? 
Haughty and 
proud are the friends of her 
marriarre; 
How she must feel what she dares not speak. 
She, perchance, smiles for earliest hours, 
Grieves for the sorrows that he must endure, 
And would give up the world for a 
wreath of wild 
flowers. 
Why did she leave him ?—because he was poor.

How oft we talk of childhood's joys, 
Of tricks we used to play, 
Playing " hooky " from the school, 
To sport the live-long day 1 
And, oh! how often do I 
sigh 
For those bright days of yore, 
When Billy Brown and I

Some boys would stealing apples go 
While others used to stray, 
Down on the docks, where sugar casks 
In rows together lay ; 
But Bill and I 
would seek the spot, 
So dear to us in yore, 
And side by side, together slide, 
Down the old cellar-door. 
Yes, I 
would, &c. 
But at last, a 
change came o'er the scene, 
When poor Old Grimes he died. 
His son removed the cellar-door, 
On which we used to slide ; 
Our mothers they were proud of it: 
For the pantaloons we tore. 
They bad to be half soled and heeled, 
From sliding on the door.

would, &c. 
But, since I 
arrived to manhood's age, 
The only sport for me.

Air:—" If a

Body." 
There's a 
very old custom, which custom approves. 
And good this old custom still keeps, 
That any youth must forfeit a 
pair of kid gloves, 
If he is kiss'd while he sleeps, 
Now Miss Sally Snubs, had a 
very snubb'd nose, 
And she turned up her nose so she turn'd up her 
nose night and day, 
And to her distraction instead of attraction.

SPOKEN.—There is no mistake about her nose, 
and she knows it, and every body else knows it, 
and that those who don't know it ought to know 
it, and that every body may know it. 
Here is a 
picture of Miss Snub's Snubbed nose. 
This is the nose, that turn'd all the young men 
away, 
The Snubb'd nose, the turn up nose 
That turn'd all the young men away. 
It was at a 
party, a 
birthday to keep, 
She met with a 
wag of a 
fellow, 
And she stole a 
kiss from him while he was asleep, 
For this young wag had got rather mellow. 
She then r•msed him up and to him did say, 
" 
You must do what custom approves, 
While you slept, I 
k'ss'd you, your forfeit now pay. 
You owe me a 
pair of kid gloves. 
SPOKEN.—Now Charley Wag, was too much of 
a 
way* to be kidded by a 
female, " 0, 0, 0," says he 
that's your game, first to kiss me, and then to turn 
up your nose at me. Well one good turn deserves 
another, so I 
give you turnups and that is turn for 
turn; so Miss Snub I 
am not to be snubb'd by you, 
'and that you may, Ladies and Gentlemen, know 
this Charley Wag for such a 
wag ought to be 
known, I 
here show him in a 
proper light tho' it is 
rather the dark side of the question. 
Miss Snubs being snubb'd soon to the rough 
And on leaving the party she did rave, 
The forfeit she'd won, and that fair enough, 
And that a 
pair of kids she would have. 
Then Charley Wag 
in retort thus observ'd, 
Not to pay her my honor forbids, 
So she got what she long'd for and what she de-
serv'd, 
So he sent her a 
pair of fine kids.

CHORUS, 
I

Tho' she's misruled by a 
queen, 
But I 
can't forget " ould Erin," 
Where the grass grows green. 
Poor Pat is often painted 
With a 
ragged coat and hat, 
his heart and hospitality, 
Has much to do with that ; 
Let slanderers say what they will, 
They cannot call him mean, 
Sure a 
stranger's al ways welcome 
Where the grass grows green. 
I 
love, ac.e. 
He's foolish, but not vicious, 
His faults I 
won't defend ; 
His purse to help the orphan, 
His life to serve a 
friend. 
He'll give without a 
murmur, 
So his follies try and screen, 
For there's noble hearts in Erin, 
Where the grass grows green.

love, &c.

Beautiful, beautiful blossoms of spring, 
Heralds of gladness, what rapture ye bring, 
Giving, as round us your incense ye cast, 
Hope for the future and faith in the past ; 
Types of our childhood, now passing away, 
Emblems of happiness though ye decay; 
Earth would no fruits own, around us to fling, 
But for the beautiful blossoms of spring 
Beautiful buds that in meekness appear, 
First-born of all in the happy new year, 
Wooing us back to the woods and the fields, 
Whence the delight that your innocence yields ? 
'Tis that we feel when the winter is o'er, 
Summer will all that is lovely restore, 
Proving we still to the future may cling, 
When fading away from the blossoms of spring.

" 
No more, no more shall the notes of love 
Inspire my minstrel lay; 
The song of the harp, and the voice of the dove, 
Must yield to the battle fray ; 
The foe is up, and the knights are met, 
In the proudest and best array ; 
And the trumpet sounds to arms! to arms! 
And the clarion calls away." 
No more, &c. 
Thus sung a 
youth, in whose dark eye flash'd 
The soul of chivalry ; 
Whose bosom bad ne'er been vanquished by fear, 
And whose arms like his soul was free. 
On, on, he rush'd to the battle field, 
Follow'd fast by a 
daring band ; 
Who heard the cry " to arms! to arms I" 
And, " Strike for your native land." 
No more, &c. 
The strife was o'er and the youth return'd 
In joy to his greenwood bride! 
But glory was his, and the trumpet of fame 
Re-echoed it far and wide 
And he who fought in the forest garb, 
And led on the Gipsy band, 
Now wears on his brow a 
proud warrior's wreath 
And is prince in his native land.

Reflecting on the Past. 
My story p'raps will cause surprise, 
At least I 
hope you'll sympathize, 
When I 
have told without disguise, 
The way that I've been treated. 
For I 
was very well to do 
Before a 
gal, called Sal, I 
knew, 
And when in love with her I 
grew, 
Was scandalously cheated. 
CHORUS. 
Reflecting on the past, I 
really cannot understand, 
How such an awful flat as that I 
ever could have 
been; 
From first to last, though all she did was under-
hand, 
I 
through that artificial party surely might have 
seen. 
Her calling was a 
waiter gal, 
I've mentioned that her name was Sal, 
And although as a 
menial 
She held a 
situation. 
Ere lone- her lover I 
had been, 
I 
found out, though I 
was so green, 
She was as proud as any queen, 
And far above in station. 
Reflecting on, &c. 
I 
took her to a 
fair one night, 
I 
paid to show her every sight, 
And she appeared delighted quite, 
While walking all about the floor 
Then think how she ill-treated me, 
How shamefully she cheated me, 
To lend her ten entreated me, 
And then I 
lent her fifty more.

Now comes the real affecting part, 
I 
found that she'd bestow'd her heart, 
Upon a

Along the streets it jolted. 
He served in a

Into the cart I 
saw her pop, 
And while I 
madly hollowed " stop," 
Away with him she bolted. 
Reflecting on, &c. 
I 
to business tried to stick, 
But soon became a 
lunatic, 
And next my living up did pick 
By artifices various.

But that moment the waiter ran in like a

With a 
large pair of tongs, the ends were red hot; 
Tom seized on the tongs and moving a 
pace 
in advance, put the end near the knowing one's 
face. 
" 
Why what do you mean ?" said the swell in

For the ends sing'd his cherish'd moustachios out-
right, 
" 
Excuse me," said Tom, " I 
regret to give pain, 
But I 
must mark my nose just to know it again."

How cruel to do so: 
Oh, I

He was handsome, and rich, and dress'd in the

Besides, for me, he said, he felt a

Then what could I

A

Served me as she didn't ought, 
And made of me a

Though dearly I

All for a

What keep a

While she cried `• Radishes."

With a 
basket by her side, 
As along the streets she cried, 
" 
Will you buy my Radishes."

used to stand at Chatham Square, 
Just to pick up odd jobs there, 
My passion there I 
did declare, 
She told me she loved me. 
I 
never thought that she would jilt, 
On wedding her my hopes were built, 
I 
bought the ring 'twas silver gilt, 
And cost me dollars three.

'Twas the form of his beautiful maid. 
He gazed on the figure in white, 
Whose nods gave new life to his hopes; 
His heart throbb'd with hope and delight 
As he threw up the ladder of ropes; 
His charmer hopped down it, and then 
The happy delusion was o'er! 
Girls often meet monkey- like men, 
But man never wooed monkey before.

The Swinging in the Lane 
Why should such tones decay, 
And fleetly pass away, 
Hark to their round delay, 
And music so cheering, 
Such lovely melody, 
Echoed far o'er the sea, 
Night slumbers cannot be, 
To me more endearing. 
Our way now retracing, 
Homeward rejoir:ing, 
Repose soon embracing, 
Hail, dearest home. 
Little Nell. 
They told him gently she was dead, 
And spoke of heaven and smiled ; 
Then drew him from the lonely room 
Where lay the lovely child. 
'Twos all in vain, he heeded not 
Their pitying looks of sorrow. 
"Hush, hush 1" be cried, " she only sleeps, 
She'll wake again to-morrow I" 
Hush, hush, &c, 
They laid her in a 
lowly grave, 
Where winds blew high and bleak, 
Tho' the faintest summer breeze had been 
Too rough to fan her cheek. 
And there the poor old man would watch 
In strange tho' childish sorrow. 
And whisper to himself the words, 
" 
She'll come again to-morrow I" 
And whisper, &c..

Songster. 
One day they missed him long, and sought 
Where most he loved to stray; 
They found him dead upon the turf 
Where little Nelly lay. 
With tottering steps he'd wandered there, 
In hopes fresh strength to borrow. ' 
And e'en in dying breathed the prayer, 
" 
Oh, let her come to-morrow I" 
The old man dying, breathed the prayer, 
" 
Oh, let her come to-morrow 1" 
Wait Till I 
Put on. my Bonnet. 
My father loves counting his cattle, 
My mother, she's fond of her chair; 
But ! I 
dote upon moonlight, 
Sweet walks, and the soft quiet air; 
The field, with the dew-drop upon it, 
The scent of the newly mown hay; 
Oh, wait till I 
put on my bonnet, 
Night's sweeter by far than the day. 
CHORUS. 
There are bonnets with ribbon and feather, 
But mine's like a 
gypsy's, so brown; 
A 
bonnet that's careless of weather, 
But happy's the head 'neath its crown. 
The day was intended for labor, 
But night was a 
gift to the heart, 
When neighbor might visit with neighbor, 
And love have his whisper apart. 
The life finds a 
bloom still upon it. 
And time walks in silver array. 
Oh, wait till I 
put on my bonnet. 
Night's sweeter by far than the day.

Happy as a 
King. 
See yon happy rosy boy, 
Full of life and full of joy. 
Smiling now with mirth elate 
Swinging on the rustic gate. 
Care with him was never known, 
Joyful hours are all his own; 
Chief in every rural play, 
Laughing mates his voice obey. 
Woodland scenes are his delight, 
There be rules in sylvan might, 
Leading many games with glee, 
Happy as a 
king is he. 
Monarchs of another sphere 
Have their hours of hopes and fear. 
Troubles come to mar their reign, 
Bringing sorrow in their train. 
Stately pomp disturbs their ease. 
'Tim' they strive they fail to please • 
Such is not our hero's fate 
Swinging on the rustic gate; 
Form and pride—with him unknown— _ 
Never crowd his sylvan throne; 
Thus the world luay truly see— 
Happier than a 
king is he.
