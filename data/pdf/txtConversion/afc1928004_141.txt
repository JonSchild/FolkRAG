THE TIN-WARE MAN .—BANJO-SOLO . 
Dedicated to Mr. JOHNNY FORBES, of Gov-3's American Varieties 
Philade'phia. 
Written by Pun.. H. MownitY. 
0 white folks jist listen now, 
And a 
story I 
will tell ; 
It's all about a 
hansom gal, 
In New York she did dwell. 
Her model- ,she sold apples, 
On de Union Ferry Boats ; 
Her fader made a 
fortune 
In cleaning up old coats. 
CHORUS. 
But she's gone far away, 
ne'er shall see her more ; 
She's ran off wid a 
tin-ware man, 
To Jersey's foreign shore. 
My gal she vendered hot-corn, 
And dat too in good style ; 
And her melodious tenor-voice could 
Be heard for halt a 
mile. 
She met dis hansom tin- ware man, 
(I wish he'd ne'er been born ;) 
He stopped and asked my gal to give him 
Three cents worth of corn. 
But she's gone, Sze. 
Dey walked and talked togeder, 
For a 
couple oh hours or more; 
When he asked her if she'd fly wid him 
To Jersey's foreign shore. 
And from his pocket forth he pulled 
A bottle full of gin; 
Dat settled it—so off she ran 
Wid dis man dat peddled tin. 
But she's gone, S‘c 
*s panto get a 
mus-ku-et, 
A keg oh powder too; 
A great big knife and pis-tu-el, 
And hunt New Jersey through. 
And it I 
find dat tin- ware man, 
He'll peddle tin no more ; 
But start anode'. grave-yard. 
On New Jersey's foreign shore.

A COLORED PROFESSOR 'CUSSIN DE FREE LUB 
DOCTRINE. 
FELLOW slingers ob de inestimable pribiledges ob votin' 
de Republican ticket, I'se ' peared afore yer to- night to ' cuss 
Mrs. Woodhull, an' de new an' strange ideaths which dat 
ar' much married critter am tryin' to obfusecate de 'stab-
lish doctrines, which hab been de back stay ob women since 
de time when dat culled princess, Cleopatra, swallowed de 
pearl ob great price, in obedience to de command ob dat 
wonderful delineator ob white man's excentricitie3, Wil-
liam Shakespeare, who, arter 'doptin' de Carl Shurtz style 
ob political suicide, 'peared on de jury ob de attempted as-
sassinator ob Queen Victory, an' declar'd dat de babble ob 
a 
woman's tongue wuz wuss clan de chuckle ob de Shang-
hai rooster, who got away wid more feed clan our respect-
ed President can wid presents. 
Dat am a 
fact, gemmin, 
dese am sum ob de questions which I 
ara cum afore ye dis 
yere ebening to ' cuss. 
Now, de inestimable liberty where-
wid dis yer woman, surnamed Blood, wishes to clothe de 
female sex ob de present generation, am de right to marry-
as many men as she wants to, an', by golly ! as many times 
as she pleases. 
Now fellow franchisers. dat ar am a 
pleasant privilege 
for de hardness ob human flesh, but it am a 
ticklish 'vantage 
for de human family. 
Dis kind ob hug-aft-ober love may 
do very well for de white trash, but dar's no use for to try 
an' break up de 'stablished regularity oh de married rela-
tions oh people ob culler. 
Dar's one question, fellow 'Pub-
licans, I'se gwine to ask yer. 
Suppose one ob de children 
ob one ob dem women who hab forty-eleben husbands, an' 
one ober, should come into de house ob do muchly-married 
mamma an' cry, " Mamma, dar's a 
gal out dar, scratched 
me." 
Den s'pose his mudder say, " Go tell your fader, 10 
Johnny ;" now, ladies an' gemmen, de question dat hod-
ders me an' I 
guess, wud bodder dat ar' chile, how, in de 
name ob regimental multiplicity, am dat ar' chile gwine 
to find out who is his his daddy ? 
Talkabout your Japhet 
in search ob a 
fadder, why, dat ar' Japhet's search would 
only be a 
walk ober agin de queer old strike out dat ar' 
fre-lub chile 
gwine to hab. [ I] 
' 
A COLORED PROFESSOR, 
&C —[CONCLUDED. 
Fellow ebonites, dar am an old proberb dat say, it am a 
wise chile dat knows him own daddy. 
Let dem ere free-
lub doctrines line hands Avid de notions ob de times, an' 
yer can strike any hope ob dat ar' filthier findin' wisdom 
from de book ob remembrance for eber 
eber, an' arter 
dat, too. 
Den dar's anudder question, dar's a 
provision in 
de Consittution dat de mudder mus' be able to calkilate as 
to de fadder ob her chile. 
Now, l'se gwine to tell yer, brudders, dat dis yere pro-
miscuous fadderism aim% gwine to go down, 'cause it's 
against de Constitution ob de MI-N(1 States. 'Cordin to dis 
yere free-hub Woodhullism dat aim't no tangent; Pse 
heerd ob one man faddering all de orphans, but I'se neber 
heerd ob all de ladders faddering one chile. 
Dar's de 
scratch, an' dar's whet' dis am unconstitutional. 
Yer kin 
jes bet dat if dar had bill de least show for dis yere new-
fangled fadderism Horns Greeley would hab bin dar you 
bet. 
I'se op de 'pillion dat our ole fren' Hollis ain't gwine 
to git nun' de go by when de woman question am arouse 
—if dar's anythin' decent in it, no how. Dat wuden't be 
horns if he did, an'd I'd begin to Vink dat de ole man wus 
gettin' wuss t'ings on de brain dall wantin' to be President. 
I'se gwine to tell ye, dat eberything in nature in de female 
line gets dar backs up at de male, an' I 
tell yor, fellow-cor-
porators, dat when I 
see dese yer woman folks gettin' dar 
backs up at de lords ob creation I 
allus fink dat it's ' cause 
dey need a 
little scratchin' to smooth dem down again. 
I'se gwine to tell yer, fellow-sisters, dat if yer ever want to 
hear Jordan roll, yer got to keep yen ha'r down, an' do yer 
own combin'. 
De affinity business am a 
big business, an' 
• 
r 4"t%yer got to have as many sleepia' apartments as a 
queen bee 
has in a 
honey comb if yer gwine to i'commodate all yer 
'Rattles to onct, 'specially it yer hab a 
face like Wenus and 
a 
bust like a 
Coney Island Mermaid. 
Dat's what's de mat-
ter, an' as yer forewarned I 
hope yer forearmed. Dat ends 
de fast lesson for to- night. 
De brudderen am now idvited

1776."—BANJO-SOLO. 
Dedicated to JOHN B. JONES, Banjoist and Comedian. 
Written by PHIL H . 
M OWERY. 
'Twas in the days of '76, 
You all remember well ; 
When liberty throughout the land, 
Was rung out on the State house bell. 
Old England didn't like it. 
So she took a 
foolish notion 
To try to rule its Yanks by force, 
She sent her troops across the ocean. 
When the revolution first broke- out, 
We hadn't many men; 
We hadn't many Generals 
To whip old England then. 
But when brave Warren he sprung up, 
With Marion tried and true; 
They made old England tremble, 
Beneath the Red, White, and Blue. 
Then there's another noble man, 
First on the page ot Fame ; 
The father of our country, and 
George Washington by name. 
He made old England skedaddle, 
And set this country free; 
And we'll ever praise the man that gave 
To us our Liberty. 
0 then again in 1812, 
Old England crossed the main; 
But she couldn't stand our cotton balk, 
We drove her back again. 
"f was there that hickory Jackson 
Gave her Yankee Beans ; 
And I think she never 
vill forget 
That place called New Orleans. 
Now in conclusion I 
would say, 
Old England do not boast; 
For twice you have been beat you know, 
And driven from Our coast. 
And it 
to fight you feel inclined, 
You'll find that we are bricks; 
We'll give you another licking 
Like we did in ' 76.

THE DUTCHMAN AND HIS DOG. 
Written and sung by TONY PASTOR. 
There was a 
Dutchman had a 
dog, 
A noble dog was he, 
The many tricks that dog would do 
Was wonderful to see. 
This dog would stand upon his head, 
And dance, and smoke, and chew, 
Ah ! wonderful were the great tricks 
This knowing dog would do. 
The Dutchman, he would laugh and grin, 
And then he'd look quite sad, 
" 
Ah ! if dat dork could only shpeak, 
Dis Deutcher vood be gladt." 
Then Jacob, the old Dutelunan"s son, 
Out spoke, and said he knew 
A man way down in Chatham street, 
Who'd make him that thing do. 
Old Hauntz he laughed, and then he said ; 
" 
I 
gif eine hundred dollar. 
Shust dak dat dork, and ven he shpeaks, 
You bring back my Rolla." 
So fifty of the sum was paid, 
And Jacob took the " dork." 
And sunk him in the water deep. 
In tile river round New York. 
An 1 
daily honest Hauntz would ask : 
•• How comes de dork along ?" 
" 
He says his prayers now," Jacob said, 
" 
And soon will sing a 
song." 
"'Jars goot! by golly! ain't dat goot! 
I 
ha dat dork, mein son, 
De happiest day in all mein life 
Is ven you bring him home." 
The day arrived, and old Hann' z 
said , 
" 
Go pring de dork, mein poy," 
Now Jacob's heart was troubled mu@h, 
To spoil his father's joy. 
And when he came without the dog, 
"Ha: Jacob !" cried old Hauntz 
ill 
THE DUTCHMAN AND HIS DOG..--"CoNcLuDED. 
" 
Vy don't you pring mein Rolla home 
Vett now he shpeak and dance ?" 
Then Jacob said, " I 
saw the dog," 
" 
Veil, Jacob, vot he say ?" 
Well father, he looked well and fat, 
And plainly said " good- day.' " 
Old Hauntz's eyes stared wildly, now, 
Each feature blazed with joy. 
As he in rapturous tones inquired, 
"Did he shpeak bout me, my boy ?" 
" 
Oh, yes," the wicked son replied, 
" 
He spoke 'bout you for sure, 
But what he said it broke my heart, 
That I 
could not endure." 
Ha! ha! old Hanntz was happy now, 
" 
He shpeak bout me, my poy, 
Vat did he say ?" old Hauntz he cried, 
" 
Oh ! dis ish too mooch joy." 
Spoken.—And then Jacob, who had squandered the 
--money which his father had given him, and who had daily 
lied as to the dog's progress, dreaded his father's wrath. 
As old Hanntz continued to press him in regard to what 
the dog had said, Jacob was compelled to resort to a 
stratagem, and related 
time 
following: " Well, father, 
when I 
went down there to-day, the dog was sitting by 
the stove, and when I 
went in, he says Good-day, Jacob.'" 
This statement caused the old man to rub his hands and 
dance about, ashe exclaimed : " Dat ish a 
vunterful dork ! 
dat ish a 
vunterful dork. I 
make millions fon dat dork. But 
vot he say pout me ?" Jacob answers, " Well, after saying 
" 
Good-day, Jacob," he said, 
how is the old man, and 
the young girl the old man kisses down in the cellar every 
day ?' " 
Vat's dat you say ?" 
shouted old Hauntz. 
"Hold on, and I'll tell you," resumed Jacob. " When I 
heard that d—d 
dog slandering my father, I 
was mad, and 
shot him dead." " Ha! you kilt him ?" cried Hauntz , 
"dat vas a 
vunderful dork, but 1,guess you did right, y-a-a-
a-s, I guess you didt right; dat dork might shpeak 
too mooch. A dork dat shpeak too mooch ish no goot. 
But dat vas a 
vunderful dork. 
Y-a- a-a-s, he vas bedder

vunderful dolt, but he might shpeak too 
mooch. You are a

tILLL AMONG THE HAY.—NoNcLunx.D.1 
She 's 
of bonny girls the queen, 
Born to be admir'd; 
Roaming out one day I'd been, 
Feeling rather tired, 
When as graceful as a 
fawn, 
She stood in my way, 
With a 
cask of " Barleycorn," 
All among the hay. 
Cnonus.—All among the hay, clze 
Of the beer I 
had a 
sup, 
Feeling then " all right ;" 
She said " to the brimming cup 
I 
was welcome quite." 
But she soon did me astound, 
Begg'd I'd go away; 
"Rakes," she said, " were often found 
All among the bay." 
CHORUS.— All among the hay, &a 
Still for all that I 
could see 
She was shamming cold; 
"Bought off" she should never be, 
I 
would not be " sold ;" 
Bouncing came a 
rival raw, 
But I 
made him " pay," 
Thrasli'd him like a 
load of straw, 
All among the hay. 
CHORUS.—All among the hay, cLa 
Still I 
press'd, and she " gave in," 
Owning she was wrong; 
He 's 
no man thaf cannot win 
Woman with his tongue; 
Soon the bells will peal their notes 
On our wedding day; 
Then 
sow my wildest " oats" 
All among the hay. 
CHORUS — All among the bay era

44 BREAT 
HING SPOTS." 
Written and sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Our public parks are breathing spots 
For those in Pete's employ, 
The city pays ; the motto is— 
" 
Don't hurt yourself, my boy." 
See, there's a 
five-inch p'ank to move— 
All bear a 
hand—ahoy ! 
A dozen stalwart arms assist— 
" 
Don't hurt yourself, my boy." 
! 
there's a 
twig right in that path 
Which does the sight annoy, 
Its five to dig, and ten to pull— 
" 
Don't hurt yourself, my boy." 
And there's a 
duffer with his pick; 
lie lifts it up so coy, 
And then he gently lets it fall— 
" 
Don't hurt yourself, my boy, 
Another plants his glistening spade 
And tugs— as a 
decoy. 
Now, aisy, Pat, just draw it out— 
Don't hurt yourself, my boy." 
And there one sinks a 
light crowbar, 
Then takes a 
rest, in joy, 
Two others come and pull it out— 
" 
Don't hurt yourself, my boy." 
Ho ! Paddy, with that hefty broom, 
Your victuals you'll destroy; 
A 
brush, a 
puff, •' now take a 
rest, 
Don't hurt yourself, my boy." 
There's twenty lifting at a 
rail— 
They raise it like a 
toy— 
And twenty come to lift it down— 
" 
Don't hurt yourself, my boy." 
Du' there's a 
greenhorn working hard; 
'Twon't do in this employ; 
At that rate we'll c 
triplete the job— 
" 
Don't hurt yourself, my boy." 
Now come, all hands, and take' a 
drink ; 
Let naught your prospects cloy; 
The city pays—ah ! there's the rub— 
•• Don't hurt yourself, my boy." 
And that's ! he way ts!e money goes, 
And taxes are so 
Still to liitipayerS Twct-ii1; ttays — 
Don't hurt youNelves, nivboys." 
MINNIE MOOR. 
SONG AND CIIORITS. 
Written by Pun. II. 
M OM:EY. 
On the distant prairie stood a 
lovely cot, 
Close beside a 
bright and sparkling stream, 
With its vine-clad arbor where the little dew drops 
Sparkled in the sunlight's golden gleam. 
There once bloomed a 
flower to the world unknown, 
Save the few who passed the cottage door ; 
Happy as the songsters in the wild wood shade, 
Was the flower of the prairie, Minnie Moor. 
CHORUS. 
But they've laid her down to rest in a 
grassy mound 
'Neath the branches of the oak by the door; 
And we miss the winning smile and joyous rippling laugh 
Of the flower of the prairie, Minnie Moor. 
Oft on the banks of this sparkling little stream, 
We have wandered in moon-light's golden rays ; 
And spoke of days to come how happy we would be 
In a 
cottage where the gentle zephyrs plays. 
But on one autumn eve, as the sun set in the West, 
Death threw his shadows round our cottage door; 
And from this world of care, it took my jpy and pride, 
The flower of the prairie. Minnie Moor. 
But they've laid her down to rest in a 
grassy mound, 
'Neath the branches of die oak by the door ; 
And we miss the winning smile and joyous rippling laugh 
Of the flower of the prairie, Minnie Moor.

DEM BOYS! 
THE inventive genius of Yankee juveniles has brought out a 
new toy. 
It consists of a 
tin box with a 
hole punched in the 
end, through which they draw a 
waxed thread, makinu most un-
earthly noises— some like hens, others like sick cats, and some 
per'eitly demoniacal in sound. 
The citizens of Brook-1y, have 
been much annoyed by " leetle boys mit boxes." 
Our foreigit 
correspondent from " over the river" sends us the following 
germanesque effusion, 
Der schades uf , night vas vallin' down 
Ofer der roofs of Brooklyn town, 
Ten droo der shtreets you hear dear noise 
Of five, six hundred leetle boys 
Mit boxes. 
Dese boxes vot dey shteels, I

Und round der shtreets dey goes in " rings," 
A-bullin' at dein cursed dings,

A RICH DADDY. 
As Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
I courted once a 
lovely Mss, 
With Cupid's fair cnrmival; 
But when I 
said, " Let us marry, sis," 
I 
found I 
had a 
rival. 
Now, I 
was honest, young. and strong, 
Though my father \\ as a 
Pa dy. 
But my rival's ( nly merit was 
He had a 
wealthy daddy. 
I 
offered her as true a 
heart 
As beats in any body. • 
But a 
mechanic had no show 
Against the son of shoddy. 
So. soon she wed the sickly sprout, 
And gloried in her laddie, 
Soon, in fine clothes, paraded out 
On the greenbacks of his daddy. 
My hook I 
hustled in the sea. 
And caught an humble maid. 
And in her honest, faithful love 
My struggles were repaid. 
My former love with sneering laugh 
Did often pass me by— 
My wife with sweet content just 
.` For low,' 
how is that for high?" 
Thus time went swiftly bounding on ; 
A boss I 
soon became; 
My little wife a 
lady grew 
in look and wealth and name. 
Thus whet I built a 
stone- front house, 
And hired a 
hungry laddie, 
I 
soon found out my hodman WaS 
The son of the rich daddy. 
"Come, Paddy, quick, bring up the brick 
And mortar in your hoddy ;" 
And this is what became of her 
Who wed the son of shoddy. 
And now, fair maids, a 
moral learn, 
Remember this, my rhyme ; 
There is no path so rugged that 
An honest love can't climb. 
COLUMBINE. 
Banjo- Solo. 
Written by PHIL It. mowitEr. 
Give me your attention, 
Kind friends, a 
little while, 
And I'11 try to amuse you 
In my simple style. 
It's about a fair maiden, 
Who played Columbine, 
And danced like a 
fairy', 
in a 
new Pantomime. 
ctioRus. 
Oh, dear me, my heart doth repine, 
For the fairy-like maiden in the new Pantomime, 
The first time I 
saw her, 
l 
remember it yet— 
Her tairy-like movement 
I 
ne'er shall forget. 
There's a 
hole in my heart now, 
As big as a 
dime, 
Drilled by her bright eyes 
In the new Pantomime.

Would I 
were a 
swallow— 
Ana 
she were, also. 
We'd fly far away— that is— 
If she would go — 
To the foreign shores of Jersey ! 
Oh wouldn't it be fine 
Te learn the young swallows 
To play Pantomime. 
0, dear me, It co 
But such things wont happen 
I 
know very well. 
I 
never shall meet her, 
My fond love to tell. 
Now my heart's. topsey-turvey

In the new Pantomime.

THE GOOD—TEMPERED MAN. 
What a 
pity to hear some people declare, 
That life is a 
burden of sorrow and care; 
I've lived forty years in this valley of tears, 
And of troubles I've had a 
full share, 
And I 
find it is wiser to laugh than to cry, 
And merrily sing, if you can: 
Clouds that are dark may clear up by-and-by, 
So laugh like a 
good-tempered man. Ha! ha! ha! 
I 
was always a 
good-tempered man. 
My courting I 
paid to a 
fair pretty maid, 
When I 
asked her to wed, she lovingly said : 
"Dear Daniel, it's true, I'm faithful to you, 
Believe me, and Don't be afraid." 
But in less than a 
month, her promise she broke, 
And off with another she ran. 
I 
laughed, and I 
treated it all as a 
joke, 
For I'm such a 
god-tempered man. Ha! ha! ha! 
OaI I'm such a 
good-tempered man. 
A mob in the street I 
happened to meet, 
A thief, with a 
snatch, ran away with my watch, 
My bat, with surprise, was knocked over my eyes, 
Crying, " Stoi thief!" the people all ran. 
But I 
never moved an inch from the spot, 
But to laugh and to dance I 
began, 
To think what a 
guy at that moment I 
looked ! 
Oh! I 
am such a 
good-tempered man. Ha! Its! ha! 
Oh ! I 
am such a 
good-tempered man. 
Then never give way to that demon dismay; 
If to-day you are down and acquaintances trown, 
To-morrow may bring quite a 
different thing, 
And life's but a 
flash in the pan: 
If care, as they tell us, once killed the poor cat, 
The' scarcely believe them I 
can, 
Like me, you are bound to get jolly and fat, 
If you laugh like a 
good-tempered luau. 
Ha! ho ! ha 
I 
was always a 
good-tempered man. 
I WAEN'T IN THE RING. 
Am —" When the Band begins to Play." 
Behold a 
politician, 
Who once was much adored, 
A big chief in the wigwam, 
From the Sligo district ward; 
I 
followed not the rising son, 
Which trouble did me bring, 
For I 
found the day and battle won 
By the bosses of the Ring, 
klimfeas.--But alas! fond hopes has left 'em. 
Spek, 
borrow 
citonus. 
And I 
feel so very happy 
That I 
wasn't in the Ring, 
Wasn't in the Ring, 
Wasn't in the Ring, 
And I'm sure they didn't find it 
Exactly just the thing, 
Exactly just the thing, 
For their her'Ali, oh no ! 
P'raps you think I'm joking. 
When I 
say I 
was the cause 
Of a 
heap ot solid voting, 
To uphold solid laws, 
For wasn't I 
a 
solid man, 
And posted on ev'rything, 
But now they call men fearful hani, 
So I 
stay out of th, Ring. 
n.—Yes, and I 
will stay out of it if it takes every cent I 
can 
—but still— 
I 
feel so very happy, & c. 
They put me in the bolo. 
For a 
small tailor's bill, 
And took me off the pay- roll. 
And pushed me down the bill. 
They called me one of those slouches, 
MS feelings they did sting, 
Butthey could not bring the vouchers, 
Those bosses of the ring. 
Spoken.—Yes, my integrity has always been solid with every—bar-
keeper in town— but still— 
I 
feel so 'very happy, & c. 
Every dog must have his day, 
Likewise his healthy grub. 
So now l'll pitch in right away, 
And start a 
social club. 
I'll get the boys in our ward, 
For me they'll do any thine:, 
And as long as I 
can get my board, 
I'll stay out of the Ring. 
Spoken.—Yem—thero is more on the onteide of the ring, ( look ing at 
dress 1 
than there is on me— but still— 
I 
feel so very happy, &c.

THE BENCH BY THE OLD BROOK-SIDE. 
Written by PHIL 11. M OWERY. 
0 the moon shone bright and clear, Annie 
On the night when first we met, 
And thy sweet voice and winning smile 
I 
never shall forget, 
'Twas there beside the little brook, 
Where the peaceful, waters glide, 
That first I 
learn't to love thee, 
And the bench by the old brook-side. 
CHORUS. 
Though years have past away since then, 
And swiftly the time cloth 
Still I'll not forget thee, Annie, 
Nor the bench by the old brook-side. 
The old church stands on the hill, Annie, 
Where together we've oft went, 
And many a 
summer's Sunday 
So joyously we've spent. 
And on that summer's evening 
You promised to be my bride, 
While we together were sitting 
On the bench by the old brook-side. 
Though years, &c. 
Yes, the years have past away since then, 
And they've laid you down to sleep. 
Neath a 
grassy mound in the chureh-yard 
Where the drooping willows weep. 
Thou art gone. but not tor-gotten, 
You were my joy and pride. 
And I 
never cease to love thee 
Nor the bench by the old brook-side 
Though years, (tI c.

Dedicated to Mr. PETE 
M ILLEit, of Philadelphia, Penn, 
Oh. I'll sing to you of a 
nice young-gal, 
Day called her Saria Jane, 
She fell in lub wid a 
clam-dealer, 
And Sammy was his name. 
He used to tate her every wheree, 
And her he'd often treat, 
He went to see her every night, 
At her home in Lombard street. 
As Saria Jane walked out one day, 
All in the summer's heat, 
She met her dear young Sam-mel, 
Wid auoder gal in the street; 
When Saria Jane she saw this, 
"Revenge I'll have," she said. 
So she went and stole a 
sweet- potato, 
And stabbed this Clam Man dead. 
When die young gal Sam was walhing wid, 
Saw dat he was no more, 
She rushed away wid all her might, 
Into a 
grocery store. 
Oh, there she seized a 
half of a 
cheese, 
flat on de counter lied, 
She swallowed it down all at once, 
Gave lap the ghost and died. 
When Saris Jane saw they were dead, 
She said she'd live no more, 
So she tried to hang herself, 
By standing on 1

She soon found out, dat wouldn't do, 
So another way she tried, 
She jumped off her bed down on de floor,

SAMMY THE SLOP-SELLER, SOLD. 
I 
kept a 
slop-shop in the " toggery" line, 
And the coin it freely come in ; 
But that better—or worser—half of mine, 
My ruin she first did begin. 
CIIORUS. 
My feelings have had a 
terrible knock, 
I 
shall never get over the shock! 
Oh, my feelings have had a 
terrible knock, 
And I 
shall never get over the shock! 
For every day, when home I 
was from, 
She used to get " tight" at her ease : 
She swallowed a 
coat, each day, in " 01(1 Tom,' 
And a 
waistcoat in bread and cheese. 
My feelings, & e. 
A fellow, who used to come cheapening togs, 
When I 
was away down the " Lane," 
He got my old girl in mysterious fogs, 
And she stood for him many a 
drain. 
My feelings, &c. 
On sausages, chops, and steaks for tea,

SAMMY THE SLOP-SELLER. [CoNcLuDED. 
They both of them used to regale, 
And then finish up— with her on his knee— 
With a 
gallon of " Ten-Guinea Ale!" 
My feelings, Lice. 
I 
went to an Unredeemed-Pledge Sale Mart, 
And found when again home I 
got, 
The wretches had hired a 
pony and cart, 
And cleared the shop out of the lot. 
My feelings, &c. 
They'd left me a.note, saying " Cully, farewell ! 
We've gone, you will never know where. 
We've given the door key to neighbor Bell, 
And left you a 
lock of our4air.' 
My feelings, &c. 
The boys shout, " There goes Slop-seller Sam, 
Who's been done brown by his wife !" 
Now forced to carry on trade I 
am 
Al-fresco, the rest of' my life. 
My feelings, Sz,e.

You want, or a

I'll fit you to rights, with what can't be beat, 
From fifteen to twenty-five hog.'

(4 IT'S A SECRET HOW WE DO IT!" 
T HE POSTMAN.

28 
As Sung by TONY PAST011, 
De ladies nowadays, 
With such peculiar ways. 
To fascinate a 
man dey nebber fail ; 
Dey promenade de st.eet. 
Smile at all de men dey meet, 
And smile beneath a 
little four-inch veil. 
On de fashions (ley depend, 
But dey's dropped de Grecian bend, 
And dat halt yard upon each - shoe. [creatures, 
And one of our first features, is to sport dese darlin' 
it's a 
secret how we do it—but we do. 
o 
down Broadway each morn, 
And as sure as I 
am born, 
You'll find a 
crowd of fellows 'round about, 
All dressed from " top t' toe." 
Wid dere I4a'r comb'd back just so, 
And waitin for de fast young gal dat's out. 
Now, we who claim t' be 
Of de fust society— 
Wouldn't take improper liberty—dat's true; 
But de truth we can't deny, we all goes it on de sly : 
It's a 
secret huiw we do it—but we do. 
One day last week I 
started, 
A husband. broken-hearted. 
For aiy ‘vite scolded me enough to kill; 
I 
knew she would have done it, 
For she bought an " Alpine " bonnet, 
And I 
told her I'd nebber pay de bill. 
I 
met a 
charming maid, 
So down the street I 
strayed, 
And arm in arm we walked de avenue ; 
It's strange, upon my life, how a 
tnan'll leave his wife : 
It's a 
secret how we do it— but we do. 
Nine year I 
has been wed, 
And I 
neber wished me dead. 
Dough wid sorrow l's often shed a 
tear; 
But de world goes on you see, 
Wid Lucky Ann and me, 
And our family increases ebery year. 
We've three pair o' twins, 
And we dress 'em snug as pins. 
And de neighbors say anoder pair is due. 
Mid such a 
rism' crop, Lucky says we'll neber stop ; 
It's a 
secret bow we do it—but we do. 
There was a 
maiden loved a 
youth, 
In the town where I 
was born in ; 
And she wrote to him by the evening post, 
To meet her in the morning, morning. 
The wicked postman he forgot. 
The' letter to deliver ; 
Then, Oh, she cried, my love is false, 
And plunged into the river, river. 
When Frederick heard his love was lost, 
Who he loved so particular ; 
He plunged into a 
water-butt, 
'till his legs were perpendicular, dicular. 
Now when the postman heard the news, 
his conscience smote h'in shocking ; 
You might have heard his knees with fear 
Against each other knocking, knocking. 
So he resolved to give up hope, 
Which seemed to be a 
failure; 
So he put himself in envelope 
Directed to Australia, Australia. 
But others did big letters write, 
Which did the postman smother ; 
So there was an end to all the three— 
He, and she, and rotifer.

I'D LIKE TO BE AN ELEPHANT. 
I'd rather be an elephant, 
If I 
only had the power ; 
To suck up honey with my trunk, 
From every opening flower. 
I 
envy not the camel, 
I 
envy not his load ; 
I 
envy not his driver, 
Nor the stick that does him goad. 
CHORUS. 
l'd rather be an elephant, 
If I 
only had the power; 
To suck up honey with my trunk, 
From every opening flower. 
I 
love the modest donkey, 
His voice is low and sweet; 
It's musical—hear him 
Greet his brother in the street. 
I 
love the gentle monkeys, 
With their manners wild and free ; 
For bonny Annie Laurie, 
I 
could lay me down and die. 
I'd rather be, &c. 
Some would rather be a 
daisy, 
Than any other flower ; 
Now we all know a 
cow could eat, 
Ten thousand in an hour. 
Then do not be a 
daisy, 
Or any other sprout; 
But rather be an elephant, , 
And wag your trunk about. 
I'd rather be, &c.

THE CROSS-EYED COOK. 
There was a 
little drummer, 
And he loved a 
cross-eyed cook: 
And he beat a 
rat-tat on her heart, 
With many a 
killing look. 
Whene'er he went, on courting bent, 
She hopped about so nimbly, 
For she had one eye in the pot, 
And the other up the chimney. 
Whack row de dow dow. 
Whene'er the mister was a-bed, 
And all the house was fast asleep, 
Tile drummer out of barracks stole, 
And slily off did creep. 
Whene'er he came he brought his drum; 
And his little heart did beat like tinder ; 
And he beat a 
rat-tat, too, ju t 
beneath 
The old cook's window. 
Whack row, ctc. 
The cook well knew the signal; 
She came down and let him in, 
And served a 
good hot supper, too, 
Which made the drummer grin. 
Then down he sat to two ducks fat; 
lie gobbled up and swigged the bottle, 
And just as he was finishing, 
A 
bone stuck in his throttle.

The cook then took the drumstick, 
She gave the drummer such a 
souse, 
lie kicked :inc knocked the tables over, 
And he woke up all the house. 
Th maker rose in his night clothes, 
And down the stairs came poking, 
When he saw the old cook fainting, 
And the little drummer choking. 
Whack row, cte. 
When the cook she saw her master, 
She hit the drummer such a 
blow, 
lie opened his mouth so very 
That the bone down whole did go. 
Then rising plump to take a 
jump, 
Ire rie I

But the very fir•t step he took,

And the boys all hallooed after him,

THE COT ON THE HILL. 
Written by PHIL H . 
llowlatr. 
There's a 
dear little cot on the hill-side, 
Where in my childhood I've strolled, 
With bright flowers clustering round it, 
And a 
pearly white stream past it rolled. 
Shall I 
ever forget the green valley, 
That spread out like a 
picture before, 
The little low porch and the oak tree, 
That stood by our old cottage door. 
CHORUS. 
But those bright days are faded and gone now, 
And the cottage has gone to decay, 
And all the dear friends of my childhood, 
Like the cottage they've long past away. 
Yes, the friends of my childhood are gone now, 
Away from this world's bitter care, 
Some sleep neath the old village church-yard, 
Where sweet flowers perfume the calm air, 
But I 
turn with a 
sigh from the grave-yard, 
To wander by brook- let and rill, 
And think of my once happy childhood, 
In the dear little cot on the bill. 
ItIY NOSE, 
Sang by 'FONT PASTOR. 
All1.— ' Jim along Josey. 
I've heard as mother longed, 
Before she had me, 
For a 
luscious- looking, 
Rips big mulberry ; 
So that is the reason. 
My friends suppose, 
I 
was born with this 
Classical, prominent nose. 
CHORUS. 
For I 
am a 
descendant 
Of famous noses. 
And everybody knows my nose. 
Now with this /ere nose, 
I 
knows, I 
nose 
Out ninny queer things 
Wherever I 
goes, 
With my itixtensive, elegant snout, 
I 
daily find various 
Matters out. 
It's not exactly Roman, 
Nor quite antique, 
But as father was Irish, 
I 
sit ' pose it is Greek ; 
It don't belong te the 
Turnip I 
opine, 
For it looks more like 
in the carrot line. 
There is Louis Napoleon, 
He has got a 
tidy smeller, 
And to nose out exiles, 
lie is just the fellow. 
But he don't seem aware 
That he is making any foes, 
So, I 
don't think he sees 
Much beyond his nose. 
It's been handed down 
From the wisest monk, 
That the most sensible man 
Has the longest conk, 
So I 
think our c. airman 
Has very well fared, 
Ile was not out of the way, 
When noses was shared. 
Now I 
nose by my nose, 
Tint it's getting near time 
I 
should finish my nose-
Elogieal rhyme ; 
But as I 
an; proud of it, 
I 
hope none will scoff, 
And nobody try to 
Take my nose off.

His arm is strong and his heart is true, 
What gies the Highlandman courage and glee ? 
What but the drops of his mountain dew ? 
When toss'd on the ocean o' carking care, 
When fortune looks black, and friends are few, 
What makes the Highlandman conquer or bear ? 
The magic drops of his mountain dew.

wha would keep pleasure and health in view, 
Let him nerve his bare ; imbs in the mountain wind, 
And warm his heart with the mountain dew.

Thy weapon to these, and thy welcome to those, 
The broad claymore and the mountain dew.

HE THAT WILL NOT MERRY B. 
Now, since we're met, let's merry be, 
In spite of all our foes; 
And he that will not merry, merry be, 
We'll pull him by the nose. 
CHORUS. 
Let him be merry, merry here, 
While we're all merry, merry there, 
For who can know where he shall go 
To be merry another year. 
He that will not merry, merry be, 
With a 
generous bowl and a 
toast, 
May he in Bridewell be shut up, 
And fast bound to a 
post. 
Let him, 
He that will not merry, merry be, 
And take his glass in course, 
May he be obliged to drink small beer, 
Ne're a 
penny in his purse. 
Let him, cEe. 
He that will not merry, merry be, 
With a 
company of jolly boys, 
May lie be plagued with a 
scolding wife, 
To confound him with her noise. 
Let him, (1.:c. 
He that will not merry, merry be, 
With his sweetheart by his side, 
Let him be laid in the cold churchyard, 
With a 
hard stone for his bride. 
Let him, die. 
THE WAGGONER. 
They say l'se but a 
waggoner, 
Yet a 
waggoner 111 be, 
There's lots of drivers in the world 
Not half so bly-the as me. 
Your great folks be'n't so happy 
As myself, my wife, and tyke; 
As to Care, I 
never see'd him, 
So I 
don't know what he's like. 
CHORUS. 
Wo, ho ! there so gettly, 
So gently as I 
seem. 
I 
smacks my whip and whistles, 
While I 
drives my team. 
I 
rises in the morning, 
Just about break of day, 
For 
think about the maxim, 
" 
Whilst the sun shines make your hay." 
And it doesn't do to lay a-bed 
While summat -s 
to be done; 
Work first and pleasure afterwards, 
That's the way, lads, to get on. 
Wo, ho, cic 
I 
always helps a 
neighbor, 
If I 
sees him in distress, 
And thinks a 
man not quite a 
man, 
What aims at doing less. 
For tho' l'se all I 
wants myself, 
For other's %yank I 
feel, 
If friends be fast, assist them— 
Put your shoulder to the wheel. 
No, ho, cfrc. 
So thus I 
thinks if times are bad, 
Mayhap in time they'll mend, 
And while l'se friendly o 
myself, 
[se always have a 
friend. 
We can't be always lucky, 
And escape misfortune's thumps, 
8o take what's sent us cheerfully, 
True Hearts are always Trumps. 
Wo ho,

THE MERRY DAYS OF OLD. 
A , 
B, 
C. 
W ords by CHA.s. JEFFREYS. M usic by SIDNEY NELSON. 
The merry days—the days of old 
When hawk and hound were nigh; 
When gallant lords and ladies fair, 
Drew sport from earth and sky; 
The horn resounded thro' the dell, 
Forth rode the barons bold; 
Oh 1 
those, indeed, were merry days, 
The merry days of old. 
When ruddy health and laughing joy, 
the maiden's face, 
And 'twas her pride on palfrey free, 
To follow in the chase; 
To dare the summer's scorching heat, 
To brave the winter's cold ; 
Oh I 
those, indeed, were merry days, 
The merry days of old. 
When troubadours and roasquers gay, 
In castle halls would stand, 
And wake the song to willing ears, 
Of knights in Holy Land; 
When winter brought its wassail bowl, 
To keep the heart from cold; 
Ohl those, indeed, were merry days, 
The merry days of old! 
First, r-a-t 
spells mouse, I 
know, 
And s-u-tn is total, 
R-o-o-k 
stands for crow, 
And f-1-y, blue bottle. 
P-i-g is our old sow, 
And f-a-t 
spells grease; 
B-u-1-1 stands for cow, 
And d-u-c-k 
spells geese. 
CHORUS. 
Then who beats me at a, b, c, 
For I 
never mutter, stutter in a 
flutter.; 
For they all declare I 
am all there, 
That's my form at a, b, c. 
Abcdefghiiklmnopqrstuvwxyz, 
That's all out of my fat head. 
G-n-a-t 
spells busy bee, 
And g-i-r-1 is daughter; 
And m-i-l-k, now let me see, 
Why that spells chalk and water. 
R- u-m 
is something queer, 
Which makes most people merry; 
And p-o-p 
is ginger beer, 
And g-i-n spells sherry. 
Then who beats me at a, b, c, 
For I 
never mutter, stutter in a 
flutter; 
For they all declare I 
am all there, 
That's my form at a, b, c.

That's all out of my fat head. 
A NIGST AROUND TOWN. 
A descriptive medley song, written for TONY PASTOR, by J.F. 
POOLH, 
Sang by TONY PASTOR. 
Ant:—" Joe Bowers" 
Come listen to my ditty, I 
shan't detain you long. 
Of a 
night in New York City, I'll tell you in in 
song. 
I'll try my best to please you, and do tile tiling up brown, 
There's curious sights, I 
tell you, to be seen in this ere 
town. 
(Ant :—" Abram's daughter.") 
Some time ago in love I 
fell, 
(And don't you think I'd orter ;) 
With a 
charming girl, and quite the belle, 
A codfish merchant's daughter. 
Hill' daddy's hope, site's got the soap. 
Yes, lots of the spondulicks, ob, oh, oh. 
And soon, you see. we'll married be, 
(And don't you think \ 
we'd orter?) 
Because she likes me. and I 
likes the, 
This codlish merchant's daughter. 
Spoken.—The other evening we went out for a 
stroll, we 
dropped into 1Vahaek's to see the Florences. 
Saw Billy 
playing Paddy Oltafferty. 
Something ill this style: 
(Imitate Florence.) 
Be me sowl. they tied me up. head an' heels, and threw 
Inc down in the hould o' the ship. an there they left me, 
in lavendher, I;ke Paddy 'Ward's pig. 
At last a 
tellow 
stairs. Oil the deck, sings out : ' Land • Where is it ?' says 
I. • There,' says he. • Where ?' says I. • Don't you see it ?' 
says he. 
No. says I. ' Look over the cat-head, • says he. 
Well, I 
looked about, but bad luck to the cat's head or cat's 
tail I 
could see. 
D'ye mind ?' 
Then Mrs. Florence sang " My Johnny was a Shoe-
maker " in this manner: 
(Sing a 
verse in im:tation of Mrs. Florence.) 
.Then we took a 
walk over to Lie Cremorne Gardens. 
Sat down a 
while. -There were it couple of Fifth Avenue 
idlers near us. 
One of them spoke, sumethin,g in this 
fashion : 
(Imitates the drawling tone of a 
fop.)

A NIGHT ABOUT TOWN.—[ComirtuED. 
" ! Wobert, deuced fine place this ; decidedly select 
and demned awistocratic ; great place for the gals, charm-
ing cweatures. 
See that & limed delightful piece of calico 
winking at Inc. 
Aw! looks 
like nay washerwoman's 
daughter. 
Hate washerwomen ; they pewseut bills, and 
bills are downed extravagance. Aw, waitaw, I 
feel & tuned 
hungry ; bring me two strawberries and a 
pickled oyster. 
And. aw, waitaw, half a 
sawdine and a boy to wax my 
tws." 
Then we heard Patti sing that divine aria from the opera 
of 
This is the style: 
(Imitation of Patti. 
Burlesque operatic.) 
After which I saw my charmer home. and sauntered 
down Broadway. Dropped into Bryant's just in time to 
hear Dan in his stump speech. Dan Bryant in 
Pat's Vot's 
de Matter." 
(Imitates Dan Bryant.) 
"Secondly in de twenty fust place, my sweet geraniums, 
who was de -lust man that invented de nigger ? 
Was it 
Senitor Sumner, or was it General Fremont ? or was it 
Horace Greeley ? 
Dat's de question. 
When General But-
ler landed at New Orleans, what was de fast thing he 
asked ? 
Which am de leading journal here whett you want 
to shave—Confederate bonds or Gayetty's medicated?" 
Then I 
called in at another place. I 
guess some of you've 
been there, 444. 
Heard Tony Pastor sing a 
song. 
They 
say he can sing, but I 
don't believe it. 
This is his style : 
(Ant :—" In the Merry Month of May.") 
The nation's cry is now to arm, 
And at the call the people come; 
They leave behind their shops and farms, 
And join the ranks to follow the drum. 
And all rush on our army swelling, 
To do or die with brave McClellan; 
A million of Men, it he should need 'em, 
Are willing to strike or right and freedom. 
The nation's cry, &c.

A NIGHT ABOUT TOWN.—{CONCLUDED. 
Spoken.—I 
started for home. The streets were quiet, 
.with the exception of the organ-grinders ; they never go 
to bed. 
The first corner I 
came to there was one grinding 
" 
Annie of the Vale," and at the next another was playing 
away at 
Sweet Kitty Clyde." I 
passed a 
party of musical 
young gents, who, in the words of Shakespeare, 
Wear their lungs out shouting through the town, 
And make the 
night hideous screeching—Old John 
Brown." 
A slight idea of the " midnight serenaders." 
(Sings in imitation of an intoxicated party.— A IR, " 
Annie 
of the Vale.") 
Then night stars are glowing, the moon it's a 
flowing, 
(Mc) The radiance fills the ( hie) summer-er 
(Music changes imperceptibly to " John Brown.") 
While John Brown's knapsack is a-mouldering in the 
grave, 
John Brown's knapsack is a-mouldering in the grave, 
John Brown's body it's strapped upon his back, 
While he goes marching on. 
(Drunkenly.) 
Bic 
horraw ! chorus, fellows! 
Conic in thy beauty, 
Glory halleluyah ! 
John Brown 11 hang Jeff Davis on a 
sour apple- tree. 
Spoken.--,Hooray for us! 
Who's afeard? A brandy) 
sour with a 
stick in. 
No, sir—no, sir. 
I 
don't care a ( hic-
damn if you are a 
policeman. 
A policeman is as good as 
any other man, if he treats, 
You see, that's the ( hie) dif-
dif—difference between a 
good fellow and General Beaure-
gard. 
You see, (hic) a 
good fellow, he treats, and Bemire-
gard, he retreats. 
Hooray! 
(Ant :—" Paddy's Wedding.") 
And so, all right, I 
spent my night. 
As I've told you in my ditty, oh, 
To see the sights. its shades and lights, 
New York is just the city oh!

A PRIVATE OPINION OF MINE. 
Written by PHIL. II . 
MOWREY. 
Banjo Solo.— Dedicated to my old friend, JOHN B. 
JONES. 
Banjoist 
and Comedian. 
Kind friends your attention give me for awhile, 
And listen unto my rhymes, 
And I'll do all I 
can, for to please every one, 
While I 
sing of those troublesome times. 
There's a 
rumble and row, all around us jist now, 
And to settle it up it's quite time, 
So if you'll listen, I'll give to you all, 
A private opinion of mine. 
Now there is old England across the big pond, 
A trying to kick up a 
row— 
And say that the claims of the Alabama. 
They never will settle no how, 
Now John Bull, you had better take a 
fool's advise, 
And settle it while you have time, 
If you don't you will soon get a 
flea in your ear, 
That's a 
private opinion of mine. 
On the Island of Cuba, they've had quite a 
time, 
A battling for freedom and rights, 
And the Spaniards not seeming to care what they done, 
Have unsettled our own Stars and Stripes. 
We will out with an army, and man every ship. 
And settle their hash in quick time, 
If they don't quickly release Dr. Howard again, 
That's a 
private opinion of mine. 
We want nought but what's right, from England or Spain, 
And that we will shortly demand, 
And the flag of our country, respected must be, 
Either on the broad seas or the land. 
Should the dark clouds of war, overshadow our homes, 
And the bright star of peace ceas3 to shine, 
That Columbia will ever take care of herself, 
Is a 
private opinion of mine

shy! I can't pass a stay-shop, be-cause I'm so shy. 
Some people go to the theatre each night, 
To see actreses dress'd comme ilfaut, 
But I 
never will cast my eyes on the stage 
Unless the foot-lights they put low; 
There's the ballet girls too, so graceful to view, 
To see them is stretch'd ey'ry eye; 
To some this is good, but ' tis not to me, 
For I 
feel most awfully shy, 
Ballet girls' movements are all very well, 
But I 
feel so wretchedly shy. 
Cno.—Shy, shy, shy, shy! 
Oh! I'm so shy—dreadfully shy, 
Shy, shy, shy, shy! 
I 
would, if I 
could, but I 
can't; I'm so shy. 
For all I'm so shy, I 
once fell in love, 
To my sweetheart no question could pop, 
For hours I 
would sit by my loved one and say— 
Nothing! and then I 
would stop; 
She put the question, I, blushing, said "yes," 
Got married—I 
felt I 
should die, 
To think of the future, tears came to my eyes, 
I 
felt so terribly shy, 
Yes, to think of the future, tears came to my eyes. 
For I 
felt so uncommonly shy.

Oh! I'm so shy—dreadfully shy,

THE PEA-NUT STAND. 
Some time ago, or maybe later, 
Lived a 
chap, no small imtato: 
Liquor store he was a 
waiter, 
Teztling on the calls. 
He'd curly hair, and jet black eyes. too, 
Pointed chin and nose large size, too; 
lie served out coffee and oyster pies, too, 
Cakes and cod-fish balls. 
Now there was a 
girl, one Jane Matilda; 
Love for him had nearly killed her; 
She was a 
straw-bonnet builder, 
At a 
house down town. 
For form and beauty none could beat her; 
Every dght he %, ent to meet her, 
And to hmonade would treat her; 
Oh ! he did it brown. 
His form was slight, none could be slighter; 
Apron white, none could be whiter ; 
\V nen he got tight, none could get tighter, 
When upon the spree. 
One day into a 
shop he dropped, 
And for q 
ite a 
while he stopped, 
Till the quesai( ii he had popped, 
They would married be. 
He promised he'd be her defender, 
And to the altar he'd attend her, 
But he soon fr,tt on a 
bender, 
And he soon got tight. 
The piliceman found him in the gutter, 
Not a 
word he scarce could titer; 
So they took him on a 
shutter 
To the station-house that night. 
And for ten days they did commit him, 
And the girl gave him the mitten ; 
For with a 
barber she was smitten, 
And they soon got wed. 
The waiter found his dander rising, 
Which was not at all surprising: 
So he took at quart of piscit, 
And he died. 
LIFE OF A CLOWN. 
Come listen to me and I'll sing you a 
song. 
It's not very short and it's not very long ; 
But all about me— such a 
comical elf. 
Alt ! sure you are laughing, so 
laugh myself. 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, fol de rol lol. 
My nurse, poor old soul, she fed me with pies, 
My mother she taught me plenty of lies, 
And my master, Old Pants, has learnt me to Ihieve, 
So I'll cheat all I 
can, and Iii laug-h in my sleeve. 
Ha, ha, ha,

Roll my eves round from north to the south, 
And you plainly may see I've a

Oh, as I 
walked out one morning— 
It was in the afternoon— 
The snow, if fell thick and fast— 
It was in the month of June— 
When I 
spied a fair damsel, 
And her loss she did deplore, 
Saying, my love, he's gone a 
soldiering, 
I 
shall never see him more. 
Then I 
stept into a 
passage, 
For to hear what came to pass, 
When a 
man that carried a

lie stept up to the lass. 
Says 11,, Lucretia SrunblIne,

NEVER GET EXCITED. 
By T. F. Poot.E. 
Ara:—" The Album." 
One Davy Crockett, I've heard said, 
A motto once was making ; 
"Be sure you're right then go ahead, 
In every undertaking." 
By foolish haste, you'll often find, 
Your prospects oft are blighted, 
It's always best to take it cool, 
And never get excited. 
CHORUS. 
Then this advice I 
give to you, 
To heed it you're invited, 
What'er you say, what'er you do, 
Don't ever get excited. 
A hasty man in quarrel never 
Hears an explanation, 
But strikes right out, " Police " is called, 
lie's dragged off to the station ; 
And then with ten days in the Tombs, 
His folly is requitted, 
That wouldn't happen, if like me, 
He never got excited. 
Then this advice, (tc. 
It's now some ninety years ago, 
John Bull he got a 
warning, 
On Bunker Hill, one summer day, 
So early in the morning.

He tried to be defeating, 
But got a

And when Rebellion raised its head, 
And war disturbed our nation, 
And rebels South, and traitors North, 
Were spreading devastation.

And soon our wrongs were righted. 
He struck a 
line. 
He fought it out, 
And never got excited. 
Then this advice, Sx. 
Now Fanatics and Radicals, 
Our country would be runnin', 
And Congress swears that they prefer 
The Nigger to the Union.

PARODY ON " YOU'LL REMEMBER ME. 
0, listen to a 
story sad. 
About a 
girl named May, 
My p„,ace of mind was ne'er disturbed, 
Till a 
chap popped in the way. 
For she was as lovely as the moon, 
And lived at Tennessee ; 
And I 
always thought, upon my life, 
That she'd remember me! 
That she'd remember me! 
One lovely night, when the stars shone bright, 
Towards her house I 
strolled, 
When in the parlor there I 
saw 
A chap a 
setting bold. 
Into the room then I 
rushed, 
With rage could scar,ely see, 
And as I 
punched him on the nose, 
said, 
Now you'll remember me ! 
Now you'll remember me. 
He called, " Police !" the bobbies came; 
He told them what I 
had done, 
And then before the magistrate 
Of course I 
had to come. 
The judge, with one eye upon his book, 
From me he would take no fee; 
And as he sentenced me six months, he said, 
Now you'll remember me I 
Now you'll remember me I

AWFULLY JOLLY! 
I 
sat in my chamber one cold Christmas Eve, 
A bachelor wretched and dreary, 
A 
friend of mine bearing the name of Jack Reeve, 
Ca11'd on me with greeting so cheery ; 
" 
Old fellow, it's Christmas, so shake off that frown, 
You certainly look melancholy, 
Pack up, I've an invite from friends out of town, 
And I 
know ' twill be awfully Jolly !" 
CHORUS. 
It's a 
poor heart that never can rejoice they say, 
And fretting is nothing but folly, 
As Christmas it doesn't come Wry day, 
We'll try to be ' awfully Jolly !' 
Jack call'd a 
Hansom—we started direct, 
Fall speed to the Paddinton station, 
And met with a 
missing) we didn't expect, 
And not to our gratification ; 
The horse it fell down and over its back 
I 
was thrown, and Jack roar'd frantically, 
As I 
rose from the gutter, all cover'd with black, 
" 
Old boy, you look Awfully Jolly." 
It's a 
poor, & c. 
Arriv'd at our friends in the country, we found, 
There were visitors there by the dozen, 
The Smiths and the Whites, the Joneses and Browns, 
And many a 
country cousin. 
Such a 
bevy of girls— with beautiful curls, 
AWFULLY jOLLY. [CONCLUDED. 
To flirt with beneath the green holly, 
And kisses bestow 'neath the bright mistletoe, 
Says Jack, " This is Awfully Jolly." 
Fts a 
poor, &c. 
But really and truly the 'cream of the fun,' 
To you I 
will now be relating, 
Was when old Major Johnson who weighs sixteen stone, 
Insisted on going out skating. 
The ice being thin the old fellow slipp'd in, 
Which made us at first melancholy, 
But the sight that he look'd—as Jack with a 
book, 
Fish'd him out—it was " Awfully Jolly." 
It 
a 
poor, &c. 
The misletoe soon was brought into the room, 
And oh ! what a 
laugh and a 
giggle, 
When jolly old Sprig, who wore a 
brown wig, 
Insisted on kissing Miss Maggie; 
A 
sour old miss— so prim and so staid— 
Who frown'd on such innocent folly, 
In the struggle, the old fellow's wig it came off, 
And of course he look'd Awfully Jolly." 
It's a 
poor, Sze. 
Thus merry and gay, a 
week soon pass'd away, 
We wisli'd it had lasted much longer, 
For Jack he declar'd, as to town we repair'd, 
It made him feel seventy years younger; 
So may ev'ry one here spend a 
happy new year, 
And with fun drive away melancholy, 
Arid dull care defeat—until we next meet, 
Again to be ' Awfully Jolly." 
It's a 
poor, /to.

When people talk, or people sing 
About the days of yore. 
I always think that sort of thing 
A most prodigious bore; 
'Twixt you and me I 
can't agree 
In what they sing or say, 
Whatever olden times may be, 
Give me the present day. 
cnotnis. 
Good gracious what an age it is finr putting on the steam, 
When great events go galloping as quickly as a 
dream; 
If time could send us back again to filly years ago, 
Our life would be a 
burden, we should feel so very slow. 
Our sires of yore, old records say, 
Did nought but drink and fight; 
Their fighting lasted all the day. 
Their drinkilo , half the night: 
Perhaps we drink a 
little yet, 
But still we keep the peace, 
And if in any row we get, 
We merely shout, " Police I" 
Good gracious! &c. 
They carved their meat with gloves of steel, 
Instead of knives and forks, 
And Hume and Smollet don't reveal 
The way they drew the r 
corks. 
Those ancient banquets must have been 
A. mockery, no doubt, 
When table cloths were never seen. 
And napkins weren't found out. 
Good gracious! &c. 
Our sires were slow and steady swells, 
Who never dared to dream 
About balloons, or diving-bells, 
or telegraphs, or steam : 
They had no daily papers then 
The latest news to tell. 
They weren't exactly reading-men, 
Because they couldn't spell ! 
Good gracious I Sze. 
I 
think if any one surveys 
The present and the past, 
He won't regret those good old days 
Which proved too good to last; 
I may be wrong, I 
may be right, 
But I 
expect we'll find 
Our days are every whit as bright 
As those we've left behind. 
Good gracious! & c.

treats upon every topic incidental 
to the experience of a 
business man. 
While its main design is to instruct the 
reader in the details of commercial corresrondence, the subject matter of these 
specimen letters embrace all points of interest to the general trader._-, 
Prominence has been given to banking, and the relationship between bank-
ers and their dealers, inasmuch as hundreds of thousands of tersons main-
taining accounts of deposit and discount, are in ignorance of the duties of 
bankers and of the the rights and privileges of the dealer. 
To the body of the work has been appended :-
1. A Glossary of the Technicalities of Commerce, or terms employed by mer-
:antile men at home and abroad, as a 
peculiar and distinctive language not 
familiar to the general reader. 
2. A table ot moneys in which mercantile accounts are kept in varions 
toreign countries, information all important to dealers in imported merchan-
etze :_ and 
3. Several forms of important documents not to be found in a 
majority of 
kvorks upon hook- keeping..

hankers and triflers, and has invariably met with their approval.
