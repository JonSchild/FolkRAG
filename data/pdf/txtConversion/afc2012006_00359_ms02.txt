Summary: William Patton talks to Pat Jasper about his career on the waterfront. How he 
reluctantly took a job with his father and ended up heading the company before joining 
the Houston pilots association. He also talks about working for Dow Chemicals, how 
banks need to change the way they look at loans and the changes in the industry from 
when he started working to where it is now.

Born in 1943. Graduated in 1961. Tried to get into Kings point merchant marine 
academy. Was ready to go in August to King's point academy in New York, when found 
out that girlfriend was pregnant. SO had to get married and instead of Kings point went to 
UH night school. By 21, had 3 children and divorced by 29. Went to work for father who 
was in the towing business. Had worked for him during the summers and holidays and 
weekends. Worked for him from age 14. Went to work for him full time at 17 yrs. 
Worked on the boat -  ran crews, ran groceries, maintenance work on boat and trades like 
electrician, diesel mechanic, plumber. Still attended UH but didn’t graduate as couldn’t 
pass a few subjects. Typing and political science. Work hours were not regular 9-5 but 
very erratic.  
 
00:08:21 
Worked mostly on the boat and on repairs while working with father. He worked in the 
office. Had a three car garage shop then. Have a younger brother and came to work at the 
family company. Brother started his own business with his own towboat but was killed in 
a road accident in 1972. Started increasing the number of boats we had. In 1968 bought 
some barges. Gulf States Marine and Mining Corp. Had two barges and one boat left. In 
1971 were able to buy more barges. Bought them on a lease purchase deal. In 1975 single 
skin barges would be outlawed sooner or later.  
Had built a lot of concrete boxes on barges to stop the leaks. Coastguard made a surprise 
check once and since they were "rookies" never asked what the concrete was for. Was not 
illegal but was frowned upon. .Would have got a form from the coastguard which would 
mean going to the shipyard and have them inspect the repairs and not using the barge till 
the repairs were done and inspected. Thats why wanted to build double skin barges.  
 
00:16:11 
Inland OIl Transport. Had double skin barges. Company run by an attorney. Bought those 
barges but interest on them increased when Jimmy Carter came into power. Went up to 
20%.  Was paying 27% and just couldn’t make the payments so ended up refinancing. 
1979 was the best year they had. After that, business went downhill. Savings and loan 
debacle of the early 80s. Banks changed they way they did business. Went out of 
business in 1991 with one boat left and was working for DOW Chemical. Health 
situation was poor. while in business, worked for DOW Chemical the whole time. Never 
 
 
had a contract that lasted for more than a year, barges which were built new needed 
repair. If they are run in the inter-coastal canal, it is shallow and constantly rubbing the 
bottom knuckle on sand. Wears the barge out. Could not afford to keep barges anymore 
when banks did not cooperate.  
 
00:22:00 
Left with one boat for the last couple of years. Oldest captain retired. Crew changed. Sold 
the boat and paid off the loan. Got out without owing anybody anything. 1991 sold the 
last boat. Had hired someone from New Mexico to work in 1975. Was a staunch 
supporter of the National River Academy in Arkansas. Had a 22 month pilot training 
academy. Steering a tow boat is one of the hardest jobs there is. After 22 months, can get 
a license. HIs name was Robert Thompson. Came to work, went through the academy 
and became a captain. Worked his way up from there. In 1987 got taken by the Houston 
pilots. Did not want to hold him back. Robert became a boat keeper. Needed someone 
down in Galveston. Was hired by the them in 1991. Ended up staying there 18 years till 
retired. Was an engineer first and then became marine operations manager in Galveston.  
 
00:28:20 
Like any other manager, make sure to coordinate shipyard visits or schedule 
maintenance. If there is a breakdown see to it, get it fixed or fix it. Made sure pilots were 
getting what they paid for engineering wise.  
 
00:33:33 
Was captaining the pilot boat. Everytime it would break down, would bring it up to 
shipyard alone. Had a 100 ton license. Ran the pilot boat, operated it. operated towboats 
and barges and been an owner.  
 
00:36:40 
Think towboat captains are the best pilots. Before working for Houston pilots was in awe 
of pilots that brought the ships up the ship channel. Soon learnt that it was easier than 
running a towboat.  
 
00:40:10 
Local knowledge is very important. Back in the 70s when there was a gasoline shortage, 
was working for Synoco delivering the gasoline from pipeline from Oklahoma to 
Memphis. restricting stations from selling gasoline. Had a full load to take it to Arkansas 
to pump it off. Couldn't unload it because they couldn’t sell it off. So had to bring it back 
and then load some more gasoline on top of it. There was a terrible shortage but tanks at 
distribution centers were full because they were not allowed to sell it because govt. 
wouldn’t let them.  
 
00:44:30 
 
 
Started off with towboats, Dad towing Dow Chemical's barges. Mr. Baker had a benzene 
barge that Dow owned and would send that barge to various places to load 10,000 barrels 
of benzene and bring it back to Freeport. Would sometimes push shell barges for Horton 
& Horton. When they had their own barges, started off with gasoline and diesel fuel 
delivery for Texaco. Would load up at Port Arthur refinery and take it to Brownsville or 
Corpus Christi. Texaco entered into an agreement with Coastal refinery and Corpus 
Christi that Coastal would make Texaco gas to their specs and Coastal would make their 
gas to Port Arthur and then they swapped it out eliminating transportation and the job.  
 
00:49:10 
Barge Business. Barges and towboats are like trucks and trailers. Hauled black oil 
(residual fuel) at first. Barges were not available. 1978-79 business was very good. 
Barges cost a lot to get cleaned. Took them to Freeport and loaded them up with (Cello 
fluent?) oil. Stayed on that contract for 6 months. Ended up paying for the barges to sit 
there for the last few months.  
 
00:52:10 
was moving chemicals and petrochemicals till the late 80s. Was in contract with Synoco 
moving chemical out of Arkansas river down to smith's bluff, just above Port Arthur. 
Benzene is one of the most carcinogenic chemicals known. At 14 yrs was washing 
paintbrushes, even hands with it. It smells good. Now, need to have a closed facility 
while working with Vapor recovery system. Coastguard did not regulate shell barges like 
they regulated petroleum carrying barges. Cyclo-hexene is made out of benzene.  
 
00:55:32 
Would not breathe in benzene now, do not want to take any chances. But back in the day, 
did not know any better.  
 
00:57:00 
Regulation depleted small businesses not consolidation. attitude of the banks that 
financed small businesses. Can’t take a 20 year loan without a 20 year contract. Longest 
contract was only for a year. Couldn’t borrow money at the rate and cannot pay off 
million dollar barges in a year. Guessing process most of the time. Sometimes know that 
he is going to lose money while taking the job, 
 
01:01:15 
Couldn’t negotiate for 20 year contract. Banks did not want to understand it. Banks 
refused to issue a letter of quiet enjoyment which would mean they would continue to be 
n contract with Dow Chemicals if Patton barges went out of business. If banks had signed 
the contract could have worked and paid of the barge in 5 years. But bank refused to sign 
it.  
 
01:04:00 
 
 
Started as Patton Towing companies, some years later changed it to Patton Barge lines. 
Grandfather was welder for Magnolia Petrochemicals in Beaumont.  
 
01:06:11 
Got remarried in 1966. Have a child. Three children from first marriage were adopted by 
first wife and her husband. Son works at Kinder Morgan. First son is a water well driller.  
 
01:08:40 
Sea captain has expertise involved in their work that cannot be done by brown water 
pilots. Texas Chicken.   
 
01:10:39 
Retired in 2008. Inherited a ranch, from uncle and aunt.  
Was the chartered member of Houston-Galveston- Navigation safety Advisory comm. 
(HOGANSAC). Was on board of directors for American Waterways operators.  
 
01:16:03 
Biggest change has been the cleaning up of the Houston ship channel. Used to be  
cesspool and now there is life up in the ship channel right up to the Turning basin.  
 
01:18:45 
Don’t see break bulk cargo anymore. Single biggest change in cargo. Nothing other than 
container. Cheapest form of transportation. Only thing other than for liquids in pipelines. 
Barges carried chemicals, petrochemicals and petroleum.  
 
01:21:21 
Have to know how to use computers. Did not have that requirement 20 years ago. Most 
boats are computer controlled. Have technology that shows ships sitting anywhere in the 
world because they are transmitting satellite imagery. When started with pilots would sit 
out there and wait for a ship and it had a scheduled arrival time but would most often be 
much later than that. Now can know with a lot more accuracy when a ship will arrive.  
 
01:26:27 
Technology was developed within the last 10 years
