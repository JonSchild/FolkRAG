Written for LARRY TOOLEY by D ICK ANDERSON. 
I 
vonce did love a 
pooty gal, 
Her name was Lena Vhite, 
Und to her father's house I 
called 
To see her efery night. 
She vas so shy, mid so vas I, 
From each odder ye vould run, 
So I 
took a 
note und dell I 
wrote 
A 
letter to der Sun. 
CIIORUS. 
I 
says, " Now, Mr. Paper, 
I'm a 
poor heart-broken man ; 
I 
vant a 
gal to marry me, 
But I 
don't can ask her hand. 
I 
vould thank you for to tell me 
Just how der ding is done, 
I'll look me for an answer 
Next Sunday in der Sun," 
Next Sunday den der answer camel 
I,Ind it, read just like dis 
N 
ow Mr, Krouse ; you tell us 
Dot you 'ant a 
vife or twenty: 
Ve tell you just for fun— 
Move to Salt Lake—or to Brooklyn," 
Said dot letter in der Sun. 
I 
says, Now, &c. 
Tooley's Advice. 
Vat's de reason mit dings in dese very hard times, 
\Ten you busted and don't got a 
cent, 
Dough a 
two dollar bill you may have laid away, 
Dot's no use if you got to pay rent. 
Take all you can get, and more if you can, 
Don't let some von gif you a 
roast. 
I've heard people say clings often occur, 
Yen de least you expect dem de most. 
CHORUS. 
Den don't forget de music 
Ven you peen at a 
dance, 
But gif dem de wink and ask dem to drink, 
Gil dem poor fools a 
chance. 
You must always beat your way 
If you haven't de money to pay. 
Go to bed mit de lark, und sleep in de dark, 
Keep sober efery day. 
Do you clink if a 
man's got holes in shoes, 
Take his mudder-in-law by a 
fight, 
Can play seven out and get trust for his beer, 
And be up mit de cows at daylight ? 
Gil a 
jackasss a 
kick, if he stops get a 
brick ; 
Go home and lay down in de snow. 
You can stand on yout head, have your nose colored red. 
L. you vant to go to dcr devil—vy go, 
, 
Gasdles in de Air. 
Dis.world is full of bubbles, dere is nothing here but beer, 
And if I 
drink too much of it I 
walk off on my car. 
Go what I 
may, do where I 
will, that's what I 
do declare— 
That while I 
drink that beer I'm building gasdles in de air. 
And when I'm drunk I'm Ricked about just like a 
bale of hay, 
And if the police caught me, they will send me up ten clays. 
They'll put me in the White Maria, won't let me pay my fate, 
And while I'm on the Island I'll build gasdles in the air. 
The first man that I'll screech about to the Bowery he's dear, 
I 
suppose that you all knew him when he used to sell root bcoer, 
The girls they all were crazy ' bout the way he combed his hair, 
And when you'd pass his stand you'd see corks flying in the air. 
If you take that beer of Duffy's and drink about a 
gill, 
You'll find that it is strong enough at fifty yards to kill. 
And if you drink another drop for nothing you will care, 
The root beer that Frank Duffy sells will knock you in the air. 
And still there is another one that I 
will sing about, 
lie keeps a 
splendid tailor store down in the Bowery, 
And the best of politicians go to get their clothes made there, 
And out in front of his store you'll see clothes flying in the air. 
He'll mend your coat for nothing, and half sole and heel your 
pants, 
And take them in skin-tight if you are going to a 
dance. 
But if you try to hang him up, that's what he will not bear, 
Nicoll, the tailor, that's his name, hangs clothes up in the air. 
And still there is another name that I 
am going to scream, 
And often in the summer time I 
used to eat his cream. 
I 
told you it vas bully und it used to make me cool, 
But if I'd eat too much of it I 
feel just like a 
fool. 
Ile keeps a 
place in Bleecker street. the number I 
forgot, 
And if you think the cream is too cool he'll give it to you hot. 
Iis name is Dixon and in y 
friends,when you got time to spare, 
Cio eat his cream, and you will think you're sailing in the air.

AIR : " Dot Little German Band." 
Two weeks gone by I've peen so dry, 
I 
couldn't ge my beer ; 
De Excise law chL.ed all saloons, 
De front door und de rear. 
A friend of mine said go mit me 
Down to his father-by-law. 
De blace we found, but a

My Mary Ann. 
Sung by LATZRY M
OW:. 
My Mary Ann's a 
bruiser, 
I 
often try to lose her, 
She can not and won't be forced to die. 
She can paralyze a 
chicken, 
She is all the time a 
kicking— 
She's one of the girls that's always on the fly. 
Oh, she's gone on beef and mutton, 
She's a 
perfect glutton, 
She strikes terror to a 
Coney Island clam. 
She beat O'Leary walking, 
And Doctor Talmage talking— 
Such a 
constitution has my Mary Ann. 
CTIORIJS. 
She's a 
darling, she's a 
greasy, 
She can kick the stuffing out of any man. 
She licked Torn Collins twice, 
I 
had to put her on ice— 
Such a 
constitution has my Mary Ann. 
My Mary Ann is a 
stunner, 
She is a 
perfect bummer, 
She weighs about two hundred and fifty pounds. 
She's all the time a 
mashing, 
IIer clothes is out of fashion, 
Her equal in this city can't be found. 
Oh, you'll always find her lushing, 
You can smell her breath from Hushing, 
And the, gang all soy she isn't worth a 
dam. 
She used to go with lieecher, 
And she often tried to teach Lim 
To be a 
little tender on the lamb. 
She's a 
darling, &c. 
Cross-Eyed Katie. 
Sung by LARRy TOOLEY. 
To my darling I 
will always prove false, 
And I 
will look upon her with a 
smile of hate. 
Like the moonbeam, she is always out at night, 
And she never comes home until it's late. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, she wants to be an actor, 
Cross-eyed Katie, 
How I 
hate her ! 
Oh, she's worse than a 
rat that's in the cage. 
Oh, when you are in her room for awhile, 
You should look upon her curly red black hair. 
She can play the piano and sing " Eileen Alanna," 
If she'd sing " Grandfather's Clock" she'd get a 
year. 
CHORUS. 
If to a 
ball I 
take her the gang do holler, 
" 
Where did you get it?" 
And they say, 
" 
Does Barnum know that it is alive?" 
Duck-Foot Sue. 
DUTCH SONG AND DANCE. 
Sung by LARRY 1.00LEY. 
Oh, keep your seats a 
while, and I 
will sing to you 
The love I 
feel for a 
girl, they call ter duck- foot Site. 
She is gentle and divine. long- waisted in the feet, 
tier heels stick out behind like a 
18-karat beat. 
But now I 
sing to you of the girl I 
love so well, 
She is second-handed maid in a Chinese laundry away out 
in Kalamozan. 
Iler beauty was all she had, she was sailed like the author 
of a 
shad ; 
She had an India rubber lip, like the rudder of a 
ship ; with 
the razor she was bad. 
She wasn't very fat nor was she very thin, 
She looked \\hen she was dressed like a 
straw in a barrel of gin. 
I 
took her to a 
ball to the Hordelyobel Club, 
ft cost me a 
ten cent stamp for to fill her up with grub. 
Her eyes were indigo blue, she'd a 
voice like a 
kangaroo. 
She could chin for an hour with a 
forty horse power, and 
whistle like a 
steamboat, too. 
She'd ears like a 
Tapanese fan, and a 
voice like a 
catamaran. 
She was chief engineer in a 
hash factory ( jig) away out in 
Kalamozan.

Put a 
Headstone O'er Poor Mother's Gravel 
Written by W ILLIAM SCANLAN. 
Oh, Willie, dear Willie, our mother is deadl 
Our mother whom we loved so dear; 
She's sleeping to-night in her cold, cold ktaVO, 
No more will she be with us here. 
How happy we were when by the fireside. 
With mother we'd sit all alone; 
And what stories she'd tell to both you and I, 
Tint now she has left our dear home. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, mother has gone to Heaven above, 
And there's one thing of you I 
would crave; 
As children should do for a 
mother so true— 
Put a 
headstone o'er her beloved grave. 
How often, when sickness kept us in our beds, 
Not a 
friend in the world could we find 
Half so good as our mother, who'd sit by our side, 
And to us be so gentle and kind. 
Yes, morning and night, she'd watch our sick brows, 
Never thinking of rest; 
But now she has left us alone here to weep, 
And gone to the land of the blest. 
Yes, mother has gone, etc, 
The Old Log Hut. 
Sung only by Miss BEAN. 
Down by the river the log hut stands, 
There father and mother once 
The old door latch that was worn by our hands, 
And the church where in prayer we knelt ; 
Years, years have passed since that happy time, 
But the river keeps rolling along, 
Its rippling sound on the mossy bank 
Is singing the same old song. 
CHORUS. 
Row, row, row your boat 
Gently down the stream ; 
All that's passed is gone. you know, 
The future's but a 
dream. 
tRepeat Chorus.] 
There stands the tree we used to climb, 
And the mill with its rolling din, 
Th, old wharf b)at we used to float, 
And the school boys used to swim. 
high grass grows on our master's grave, 
But the river keeps rolling along, 
The birds, the bees, the flowers and trec3 
Arc singing that same old son:. 
-Row, row, row ;- our boat, &C,

He took the false teeth away from McNish.

Gliding down the stream, 
Beneath the bright moon beams, 
When love's afloat in Cupid's boat 
Its beauty's summer's dream. 
Gliding down the stream, 
When silver spray doth gleam, 
My joy you know is with my beau, 
When gliding down the stream. 
The stars we tried to count them, 
Bright shining over head, 
Sweet Venus kept a 
twinkling, 
'Twas then my harry said— 
If you say yes when I 
propose, 
So nervous did he seem, 
The little stars kept urging me 
While gliding down the stream. 
Gliding down the stream, Ice. 
Now all his conversation, 
While gazing at the moon,

To grant my life long dream;

Be gliding down the stream.

Where was Solomon Isaacs when the 
Loafers Stole the Geese. 
Written and sung by D AVE HOWARD. 
I'm a 
quiet Hebrew man, 
My_business I 
know well, 
And if you wait a 
little while 
My troubles I 
will tell. 
It's about a 
gang that hangs around, 
And me they always teaze ; 
And if I 
only turn my head 
From the cellar they steal my geese. 
CHORUS. 
Where was Solomon Isaacs when the loafers stole the geese ? 
Where was Solomon Isaacs when the loafers stole the geese ? 
What was he about when they cracked him in the snout ? 
Where was Solomon Isaacs when the loafers stole the geese ? 
They kicked me all around the place, 
Until my head was sore ; 
They wasn't satisfied with that, 
They want to give me more. 
My wife went almost crazy then 
From hollering out " Police ! 
There goes a 
gang of robbers there, 
They stole my husband's geese !" 
Where was Solomon Isaacs, &c. 
To the court next day I 
went, 
My wile Rachel and I. 
The judge says " What's your business here, 
What makes that woman cry?" 
I 
said, Oh, judge, good Mr. Judge, 
Just listen if you please : 
A 
gang of giraffes hangs round my store, 
.ind they always steel my gee,e."

When Grandmama is Gone, 
Sung by M ISS IDA BRUMMELL. 
In her old arm chair she's sitting, 
As in years of long ago ; 
She is knitting, knitting, knitting, 
Gently rocking to and fro, 
And a 
darkened thought steals o'er me, 
Like the shadows on the lawn, 
Of the lonely days before me 
After grandma= is gone. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! when grandmama is gone, 
When i_,,randinama is gone, 
And her prayers and tears and toils for us are o'er, 
Who will cheer us day by day 
All along our pilgrim way, 
To the beautiful, the ever shining shore, 
\Tears ago a 
dear companion 
Promised her, a 
blushing bride, 
To protect, to love and cherish, 
E'en till death should them divide. 
O'er a 
low mound ' neath the willow, 
Summer roses long have blown ; 
They will blow above another 
After grandmama is gone. 
Neith the hill the sun is sitting, 
And the twilight shadows come ; 
Still she's waiting, waiting, waiting, 
Till her Ma4er calls her home ; 
And I 
weep for friends departing, 
While they're going one by one; 
I 
shall have one more in heaven 
After grandmama is gone.

But keep it a 
secret, now mind, 
Ilccause it my wife was to find it out to-i, 
I 
know that with rage she'd go blind. 
It s 
about a 
young girl what I 
met the other day, 
While walking along in the street, 
And I 
know if this young girl knowed I 
had a 
wife, 
She would'nt think I 
was sweet. 
CHORUS. 
ow you know what I 
know and what my wife don't know, 
She don't know what I 
know, and what I 
know you know, 
If you tell her what you know and also what I 
know. 
Then she'd know what I 
know, what you know also. 
I' know that this young girl wore lots of false hair, 
I 
could see that at once at it glance, 
I 
know that her feet were much larger than mine, 
I 
found dot out when we did dance. 
She gut beauty spots all over her face— 
t & ill want to make fun at all, 
She'd a 
mole on her cheek as large as a 
beet, 
And it looked like a 
hag col-tish 
Now you know, &, c. 
This girl's hair was red or a 
strawberry blonde, 
her eyebrows hung (low' to her nose, 
She hail a 
mouth when open looked like a

It worked on a 
spring. I 
suppose. 
But still she's a 
beauty ' long-side of my wife, 
To-morrow I'll get a 
divorce. 
And the result I 
don't mind telling you, 
I 
marry this young girl of course. 
Now you know, 
HER FRONT NAME IS HANNER. 
As sung by LARRY TOOEEY. 
The heart in my bosom has lately been stole, 
By a 
sweet blushing maiden, just nineteen years old; 
She's half Irish, blonde, and likes pork and beans, 
Her feet are a 
feature— she wears seventeens. 
CHORUS. 
Her front name is 'Tanner, 
Her father's a 
tanner, 
'Him she doe's hammer, 
In an artistic manner ; 
She sings " Star-Spangled Banner," 
And " A Lean Banana," 
With a 
tooth-brush I 
fan her, 
When she thumps the planner. 
She wears a 
Moire Antique pull- hack, cost six cents a 
yard. 
Her hat and parasol are made out of lard ; 
She shall be 
lady, like Judy O'Grady, 
For I've wealth (to get) and will keep it shady. 
Her front name, etc 
Her mouth—well, it stretches from ear to ear, 
Whenever it's open I'm afraid to go near; 
Whenever she talks I'm never around, 
For I'm sure I'd fall in, and I 
know I'd get drowned. 
Her front name, etc.

You kayo heard I 
am awfully naughty, 
I 
can't help but say it is true, 
a _ wisher, you see, with the ladies, 
And a 
friend to the 01d ‘vomen too; 
I'm the favorite at all the parties, 
in the ball room I 
stand number one, 
And the youn ,,
, 
girls will murmur so sweetly— 
He is such a 
naughty old bum. 
CHORUS. 
So you see I'm so awfully naughty, 
011! so naughty. and so haughty ; 
The policemen between sixteen and forty, 
Say I 
am such a 
naughty old bum. 
I 
met a 
young charmer one evening, 
As the setting sun rose in the West, 
She looked and she winked her eyes 
that way, 
Then she quietly ladled down my vest. 
We were leaning so nice on the water, 
But she shook the son of a 
gun. 
But I 
stole her false teeth when she left me, 
For I 
am such a 
naughty old bum. 
So you see, etc. 
You notice my ulster's a 
new one, 
A 
gift from Napoleon the First, 
And I 
often think, yes. and wonder 
Whether it or my dice looks the worst : 
It's my style and my looks, not my clothing,

DON'T YOU CRY SO, NORAH DARLING, 
As sang by ANNA MItC11. 
As sung by LARRY TOOLEY. 
If you will listen to me, 
A 
ditty to you T 
will sing, 
And when you've heard it all through, 
Tears to your eyes it will bring; 
I 
am a 
most innocent man, 
I 
never did harm any one, 
The other day a 
young man knocked me down, 
And said that he done it for fun. 
CHORUS. 
Dot's de kind of a 
man vhat I vas, 
Dot's de kind of a 
toothpick I 
vas; 
If you look once at me, you quickly will soo— 
Dot's de kind of a 
hairpin I 
am. 
I 
thought me dot I 
would get square, 
I 
met a 
poor paralyzed man, 
I 
quickly took him by the hair, 
And hit him just so with my hand; 
Of course they arrested me quick, 
To the jail I 
was taken away, 
lie swore I 
hit him with a 
brick, 
And the judge asked me what I'd to say. 
Dot's do kind etc., 
DON'T' you cry so, Nordli Darling, 
Wipe those tears away, 
Don't you cry so, Noralt darling, 
Smile on me to day ; 
See the wind is freshly blowing, 
And the ship longs for the sea, 
Be to day your smiles bestowing, 
Sweetly, love, on me. 
Don't you cry so, Noralt darling, 
Wipe those tears away, 
Don't you cry so, Norah darling, 
Smile on me to day. 
Though ' tis sad to leave you, darling, 
I 
must no more stay, 
Think of me Norah darling, 
When I'm far away, 
And although to part brings sadness, 
Keep your young heart I 
1gb tand free, 
Your sweet face adorn with gladness, 
Thinking still of me. 
Don't you cry, kc. 
Don't you cry ,so, Norali darling, 
Wipe thoso tears away, 
Don't you cry so, Norah darling, 
Smile on me to- day, 
When from work I

All my thoughts on you will be, 
And my life will not seem dreary, 
If you're true to me. 
Don't you cry, & c,..

MUTTON PIE, 
(Air—" Sweet Bye and Bye.") 
As sung by LARRY TOOLEY. 
Copyrighted by A. J. Fisuliu, 98 Nassau St., N. Y 
Did you ever go into a 
saloon, 
Where they give you a 
free lunch with a 
beer, 
And when the proprieter's back is turned, 
All them bums to the counter they do steer. 
CHORUS. 
Mutton pie, they all cry, 
And they chew as they never chewed before: 
Beefsteak pie, what do you soyie, 
We'll have meat on that beautiful shore. 
You can see them every hour of the day, 
Around on the corners they do stand, 
A- waiting for some one to treat, 
they will bust up any soup-house in the land. 
CHORUS. 
Oyster pie, they all cry. 
For a 
plate of hash all night they loudly roar; 
And when they die, bye and bye, 
We'll have beats on that beautiful shore. 
Around our large hotels they can be found, 
They all have a 
lunch route of their own, 
They're the terror of the bake shops near and far, 
And at night to some hay-loft they do roam. 
Mutton pie, etc.

AIR—"Johnny come Marching Home." 
I'LL sing to you of a 
big Injun, 
Choctaw oh, law ! 
Ile really was a

Oh, la! hi, pill ! 
You never heard such a 
terrible yaw, 
Or felt the weight of such a

Yet he dearly loved a 
little squaw 
Called Kermoodle Kermoodle Kemon. 
[Repeat] 
his Injun now was seven miles high 
I 
guess, more or less. 
His head it almost touched the sky, 
I 
guess, oh, yes ! 
He jumped ten miles at a 
single bound, 
Although his feet weighed lifty pound. 
And he danced it jig when he heard the sound 
Of Kermoodle Kermoodle.Kemoo. 
[Repeat.] 
Kermoodle she loved her big Injun 
With regltri I.so I 
lard ! 
That she and he agreed to he one, 
All right I

But up came a 
soldier all in blue, 
And shot Mr. Injun thron ,, It and through, 
Till he yelled out hoop-de...doodot-doo, 
At Kerntoodle Kermoodle Kemoo. 
[Repeat.] 
The Nun did the bucket kick, 
The slict made Ii mi drop, 
Kermoodle cried ' till she was sick, 
All wet with regret. 
She saw the I 
njun under ground all right. 
Thou gave a 
scream with all her might, 
And marrioil the soldier out of spite,

DORKINS' NIGHT. 
Written by BOBBY NEWCOMB, and sung with great success b) 
W ILLIAM SCANLAN, at the Olympic Theatre, Broadway, N. Y. 
Music; published by JOHN PERRI-, 
Washington St., opposite laosioli 
Theatre, Boston, Mass. 
The theatre was full—it was Dorkins' night— 
That is, Dorkins was going to appear 
At night, in a 
favorite comedy part, 
For he was comedian here. 
Funny! why, he'd make you laugh, till the tears 
Ran down your face like rain; 
And every time he came on the stage, 
.You'd try to stop laughing in vain. 
A family? yes, he'd a 
family, 
And he lov'd them as dear as his life; 
And yond scarcely find a 
happier lot 
Than Dorkins' children and wife. 
And you'd scarcely find a 
happier lot 
Than Dorkins' children and wife. 
There came one night, and I 
was in front, 
And Dorkins was going to play 
A character new to himself and the stage, 
Which he'd trod for many a 
day. 
By eight the theatre was perfectly janimed, 
All awaited a 
pleasant surprise; 
For they knew they'd laugh ' till their sides would ache 
And they long'd for the curtain to rise. 
The play soon began—each neck was stretched forth, 
And eagerly watched each eye, 
For Dorkins to make his first entrance, and then 
To give him a 
cheerful hi 1 
hi I 
For Dorkins to make his first entrance, and the* 
To give him a 
cheerful hi! hi I 
At last he appeared, amid loud applause), 
But something was wrong you could see; 
"Why, Dorkins is playing quite badly to-night I" 
The people said, sitting ' round me. 
A 
hiss 1 
yes, it was; I 
saw Dorkins start 
As if stung by a 
serpent's fang; 
And he'd cast a 
beseeching look all 'round, 
'While his head on his breast he would hang. 
' 
He's drunk!" some one said, and I 
thought so myself, 
For, to me, it was awful at times, 
To see how he'd struggle along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines, 
To see how he'd struggle along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines. 
The footlights, at last, he approached very low, 
And, " Ladies and gentlemen," said— 
" 
I 
f 
T 
cannot please you to- night, 
The fault's not the heart, but the head. 
There's many a 
night I've made you all laugh, 
When so ill I 
could scarcely well stand; 
And every effort was pain to me then— 
Yes, if even I'd raise but my hand. 
You hiss me to-night, and say that I'm drunk," 
From his heart came a 
sob and a 
moan; 
" 
I'll tell you the reason—I 
know you won't laugh— 
I've a 
little Oli 
dying at home! 
I'll tell you the reason— I 
know you won't laugh—

ROCKAWAY, 
Written by Ell. 11ARRIGAN for DICK PAER. 
I 
took my gal last Friday fair 
To the Irish Saratoga, 
She'd a 
bathing suit and a 
Dutch spitz dog, 
With a 
head like a 
Russian Czar; 
She wanted to swim in the briny sea, 
She's big as a 
bale of hay, 
I 
made the trip to give her a 
dip 
On the beach at Rockaway. 
We soon trot afloat on the Plymouth Rock boat, 
She squatted right down in the bow, 
She i
-
•;it two hams and a 
hamper of clams— 
That's nio:e than the law would allow; 
She began for to kick when she got sea- sick, 
The first thing I 
heard a 
sailor say— 
" 
Clive her ipecac and let's put back, 
Or we'll sink ' fore we reach Rockaway." 
When we got to the beach she began for to screech— 
" 
Look out there! I'm going to make a 
dive! ' 
She dove on a 
Mick—he gave his last kick, 
As he plumb into China did drive ; 
All day she did swim, she wouldn't come in, 
" 
She'll drown!" the people did say, 
She sunk like a 
stone, and left me alone, 
On the beach at Rockaway. 
She floated ashore, and a 
fat coroner, 
Twelve sailors and an Italian band, 
Sat on her all day, and the verdict they say 
Was, slie died ' cause she couldn't live on land; 
Pooty soon she come to, saying, Richard, where are yo 
Oh 1 
lovey, take me home on a 
dray, 
Pm sweet sixteen, feed me on cream, 
Clams are too tough at Rockaway.

The left foot first then lightly tread, 
in the Patrick's day parade ; 
Then two by two away we go, 
Up Broadway through rain and snow, 
We'd face the divil, friend or foe, 
In the Patrick's day parade.

We shout hurrah for Erin-go-bragh, 
And all the Yankee nation, 
Stars and stripes and shamrock bright arrayed, 
The Irish shout, the girls turn out, 
To see the celebration, 
We march stiff as starch, 
In the Patrick's day parade. 
You should see the marshall on his horse, 
Like Napoleon TIonyparte, 
And as he rides along the line, 
He'd break each lady's hea-t, 
And if the rain should fall down then, 
We hoist our umbrellas high, 
For history states that Irishmen, 
Are always warm and dry ; 
Then two by two away we go, 
Up Broadway through rain or snow, 
We'd face the dlvii, friend or foe, 
In the Patrick's day panel 
We shout hurrah, etc 
Then here's success to Patrick's day, 
Though it comes but once a

And though I'm not D. drinking' man, 
On that day I'd drink my beer; 
I'll wear the shamrock in my hat, 
The green, my boys, ' twill never fade, 
And march along with Dan an' Pat,

THE STARS OF THE PERIOD 
Dedicated to Harrigan and Hart 
By EDWARD AUSTIN. 
Hasten for seats, do not delay, 
Great artists are in town to-day ; 
And high upon the roll of fame, 
Resplendent shines their well-known name! 
Refinement's air pervades their acts, 
And what they do no neatness lacks ; 
Reputation great they've earned and made, 
No one throws them in the shade! 
In their great act, " - lavery Days," 
Warning applause they're sure to raise. 
Go and see the " Blue and Gray," 
Clasping hands in bright array ; 
And " The Sixty Ninth" ( the " gallant,") 
Observe the boys jrissess men's talent. 
Natnre, Harrig,an has surely blest, 
Made him " different from the rest," 
And by his own majestic sway, 
Banish, he will, all care away. 
Next comes Tony, who sings so 
In dancing none can him excel ; 
Devoid of all that's stale or low, 
No rival does this artist know. 
Homage should to both be paid: 
Astonishing is " The Day Parade f' 
And other sketches they will do 
That are to life and nature true. 
Remember, the music of excellent worth 
In the mind of Brahma had its birth 
Then the manager of this great team— 
Obliging Hanley—deserves esteem ! 
SATISFACTION, great, is giv-ra to all— 
Now don't fozzet this night to 
THE ROLLICKING RAMS. 
Button up your wiliStCoat, blIttOn up your shoes, 
Have lunette!. liquor and throw away the blues, 
Be 
and g()0(1 for a 
spree, 
From TIONV till the day is dawning; 
For I 
am a 
member of the rollicking rams, 
Come and be a 
member of the rollicking rams, 
The only boys to make a 
noise, 
From DOW till the day is dalvning. 
We scorn such drinks as lemonade, soda, seltzer, beer, 
The liquors of our (+ di I'd tell to you, 
But I 
can't, for tiler 's 
1.:dies here. 
4rJoine along, come alons, come along. 
For I 
am a 
member of the rollicking rams, 
Come and be it member of the roll.cking rams; 
Out all night till broad daylight, 
And never go home till morning! 
When once You're a 
member of the rollicking rams, 
All things real, we have no shams, 
Except Champagne, good Champ.igue, 
We drink till the day i; d..wning; 
In all the pockets of the rollicking 
rams' 
Each one puts a 
bottle of Chain. 
And on some door,tep sit and drink, 
Till 
in the morning. 
With a 
pocket filll of money the Police make rights. 
To what we do they're blind, 
Such as pulling down bells and breaking lamps, 
For which we should be fined. 
Come along, come along, come 
For I 
am, Sic. 
The milkman in the morning he knows us rams, 
We follow up hehind him and empty the cans, 
Which down the area he has put, 
For breakfast in the morning; 
Upset a 
cofice stall as we go home, 
With US o:tr landladies pick a 
bone, 
And g; t 
kicked out of house and home, 
Without a 
moment's warning. 
But we don't care, we're single men, 
Not hampered with a 
wife. 
So now, my friends, ifyou like t!e• wyle, 
come and spend a 
noisy life, 
Come along, come along, collie along.

AS fashionsill , w 
are all the rage, 
Every day hrings a 
new seiFation, 
I'll sing to yo:t of Hannah McClue, 
She was it dressmaker ly occupation; 
She had a 
ith , brother, Sant, Who peddled fish : Old titlits 
Aild oys!ers, 
ise muscles, 
Till a 
happy thought 6truck hint he gave up the lish. 
And invented a 
patent rubber bustle. 
Now Sam, to give Itis bustle a 
trial, 
Tried the first one he made on lIannah; 
The very first day she went to promenade 
She silped on the peel of a 
banana. 
She no sooners:truth lii ground than she made it rebound, 
And 1.‘,1,deil on the hack of Dicky Bussell; 
Old Dicky got scared, and the boys all stared 
At the gal whit the funny rubber bustle, 
Now the boys veiled loud, and then a 
great crowd 
Soon gathered around poor Hannah; 
A policem..n new at II?..analt McGlue, 
And its d 
her in an awful rough manner; 
But she made one slip and broke front his grip, 
After having with him quite a 
tussle; 
She bounee41 .; ut, of sight like a 
little paper kite, 
This gal with a 
funny rubber bustle. 
Now, when Sam heard Hannah had bounded out of si
ghts 
lie yelled and cried out loud; 
Then he made him a 
bustle twice as big as hers, 
And swore that he'll find h 
a
. in it cloud. 
Then he jumped from the top of a 
ltlackanith shop, 
And bounced from the ground with it rustle, 
That was the last seen of Sam who used to peddle clanis 
And invented the patent rubber bustle.

Our Stage-Struck Daughter. 
Written by JOHN SHEEHAN, and sung by SIIEEIIAN and JoNzs with great 
success at Tony Pastor's. 
Pat McMonaghan, that is my name, 
And I 
have lately crossed the water ; 
My heart it is completely broke, 
For I 
have a 
stage-struck daughter. 
She says she supports Edwin Boots, or Shoes, 
Mary Anderson whit her lays low ; 
Then thousand dollars is the salary she does ask, 
Or to the theatre she won't go. 
CHORUS. 
She has her mother's heart near broke, 
Whit play-acting she is crazy ; 
Her mother wanted her to be a 
servant girl, 
But for work she was too lazy. 
She calls herself the leading lady 
In the -Ballet or Can-Can ; 
She is a 
perfect masher, and 
She broke upon the leading man. 
As a 
slack- wire dancer she is great, 
She plays the villian's part ; 
In the character of Juliet 
She broke poor Romeo's heart. 
She has her mother's heart, & c,

American Fort ane-Tclling CL.rds.—This is the old-

monds and Spades--and each of these into K for King, (4, for Queen, 
and K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to he read according to directions. 
Many of the an. 
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. Tee 
method of plying is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. 
Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S. -

vourting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such 
way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by 
stlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon askingthe momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which mielit have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. 
The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

" 
A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at M

sau street, mailed the " Little Flirt." We 
cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of" flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further neeessity of explaining "how, wizen and 
where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called -flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes; 
We have lately seen a 
neat tittle 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing t 
wenty-tive cents, ca!l‘d the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. J. Ftsunn, No. 98 Nassau Street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and sf the mean-
ing of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parascl. As 
there is nothing at all objectionabls in the volume, and its contents 
might afford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to 
recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."
