UBJECT:
 Cowboy Poets Conference
 
To: Hugh Southern
 
memorandum
.
 
The Folk Arts Program has recommended several signigicant awards to the
 
upcoming cowboy poets conference, a project that has been pulled
 
together by the folk arts coordinators of ten western states.
 It has
 
been an extremely complex thing to bring off and all manner of things
 
have gone wrong but all manner of things have gone right too, and my own
 
prediction is that it will be a solid success.
 
The event has been scheduled in Elko, Nevada, January 31 and February
 
1 and 2
.  The reasoning was that Elko is the cowboy center of the west
 
and midwinter is the period when the work cycle is lightest and time off
 
can be taken.  The organizers also did not want to be over-run; they
 
anticipate a lot of interest in the program and they are deliberately
 
setting it up so that the event is a bit hard to get to.  At that time of
 
year, for example, Elko is generally unapproachable by air; most of the
 
audience will arrive by train from Reno or Salt Lake City.
 
We are beginning to hear now that there will be considerable press
 
coverage: at last count, New York Times, Time, Newsweek and People are
 
sending in reporters.  McNeill Lehrer and Charles Kurault will be there.
 
Peregrine Smith Publishing Company will be bringing out an anthology of the
 
poetry, co-publishing it with Western Horsemen. At the same time, because
 
of the National Council meeting (at which Folk Arts has its annual program
 
review) there will be no Endowment staff there at all, and I am, frankly,
 
getting nervous about it.
 I can send in panelists and so on as evaluators.
 
Do you think that is enough?  Maybe I should appeal to Terry Melton to get
 
there?  or
  
Finally, one of the things that went wrong was that the organizers
 
forgot to get in their final grant request in time for our June panel
 
meeting and thus we had to review it in December.  They are borrowing
 
ahead on the strength of their conviction that the grant will go
 
through.
 I mention this simply so that you will know the facts of the
 
matter.
 I anticipate no trouble and wish to assure you that Folk Arts
 
does not generally do this sort of thing.
 In fact I can't think when we
 
ever did it before...

Subject:  Five Year Planning
 
I feel I really must protest the inflicting of the current five year plan
 
drafts on outside professionals.
 
Because of the short notice we were given, at least my own material reflected
 
far too little rigorous thought and refinement of concept, strategy and
 
timing; further, the format requires that one express oneself in terms that
 
convey almost nothing to anyone not used to management rhetoric; finally, the
 
documents were so rushed in the final copying that typos and mis-prints W We
 
inevitable and occurred with great frequency. and there was no time to
 
correct them.
 
I don't mind coping with this kind of problem in my own office and within the
 
Endowment, but inflicting our working drafts on the eminent people whom we
 
listed last year as representing the intellectual cream of our respective
 
fields is non-productive and even rude, I think.  Policy panels can and should
 
accustom themselves to such documents, but we bring panelists in to Washington
 
and listen to their ideas before, during and after the planning process.  They
 
have accepted an ongoing role in developing public policy.  The outside scholars
 
and artists have not, and I feel terribly bad at having had to ask them for a
 
second time to comment on a document that I myself do not believe to be truly
 
first class.

near Jan Rosenberg,
 
I a
pologize for taking so long to respond to your latter suggesting a folklorist
 
appranticesship program
..  It's just been awfully busy around he m.
 
To start off with, you have been misinformed on one point; there has never
 
been a federal program designed to develop public sector folklorists
 
either h
tere or in any other agency, to the best of r
ay knowledge.  The Arts
 
Endowment has a general fellowship program, t
he guidelines for Which I will
 
unclose for your interest.  '
A
lien applicants for t
2:is program have expressed
 
interest in folk arts, we have occasionally taken them on in this office.
 
There is also an unpaid internship program at the folk Archive at the
 
Library of Congress, and t
he Smithsonian Division of Folklife Programs has
 
occasionally taken on interns on a volunteer basis especially around festival
 
time, but that's about t
he size of it, as far as I know.
 
At one point the Folk Arts Program encouraged applying organizations such as
 
the Center for Southern Folklore or t
he Florida Folklife Center to include
 
internships in their project applications as a way of adding much-needed
 
staff and providing practical experience in the public sector at t
he same
 
time.  Indeed at one time the panel rated the development of internship
 
training as of the highest possible priority.  lbey later changed their
 
minds, in large part, I believe because of the limitations of funds we've
 
suffered in recent years.  Actually, I can't think of an issue on which the
 
panel has agonized more and changed its stance more frequently.  In the
 
crunch of budget shortages, is it really our responsibility to train folk-
lorists?  Surely, that is the role of academia.  Well, you know the response
 
to that as well as I
, and frankly the debate still rages.
 
I shall b
rim
, your particular proposal to the panel for consideration during
 
our next policy discussion, but, I suspect t
hey will be anxious to hear from
 
the coordinators themselves as to whether or not your notion is a practical
 
one from their point of view.  Adding supervision of an intern to their
 
already full list of responsibilities may or may not be welcome aside frogs
,
 
the considerations I have already raised.  However, I t
hank you for develop-
ing the idea and promise to keep you in touch with how the discussion goes
 
2
 
here.  We will surely review the entire internship issue th iz3  srrinr*, and
 
at that time will also focus on your especial proposal.
 
Sincerely,

Dear George Haberman,
 
I am sorry to have taken so long in responding
,
, to your letter of September lb.
 
It took its time getting here, and t
hen I felt I should run i
t around to the
 
various offices where i
t might find s comfortable horse, and t
here turned out
 
to be quite a few of those.
 
Everybody I consulted, t
hough, came up with exactly the same response: t
his
 
is a project, they said, that should be done with "
local" money: state or
 
territorial government, community groups, schools, and any kind of private
 
source from banks to businesses to individual patrons.  I c
ot this responsc
 
from three Lndowment programs, as well as two pro-rams in the National
 
E
ndowment for t
he Humanities.  In the latter agency I enquired whether your
 
i
dea would be fundable through your local 1uu mities Council, and the answer
 
was t
hat you don't have one.  The best ray of sunshine I can shed was that
 
I happened to run into Ana Teregeyo at a recent national conference and
 
mentioned the i
dea to her (
no names), just that there was someone interested
 
in doing a photo--docuaenting project i
n Saipan.  She said that I should
 
suggest that the project be reverred to the Arts Agency, that she hats money
 
in her budget ear-marked specifically for docurentation.  5o perhaps that
 
night be an avenue for you.
 
Fromm t
he Folk Arts point of view, you have too little traditional arts content
 
(
a fact I a& sure you are quite aware of).  However, some other problems)
 
arose during our analysis t
hat might affect the project's success in attracting
 
funding from any source.  At least t
hey may be worth t
hinking about.  If I
 
were to take this proposal to a panel, I would want to be able to include
 
evidence that the photographer was not only technically but culturally skillful,
 
that he/she had the capacity to pick up the significant detail, the culturally
 
compelling view.  One way to demonstrate that would be a ;
group of his photos
 
documenting a single subject, preferably some kind of event.  A statement of
 
the photographer's artistic philosophy might also be helpful.  Secondly, I
 
would want to know in such treater detail how the problem t
hat you set for the
 
project -
-- documenting t
he social and physical l
andscape of t
he ?
northern
 
Marianas during a period of accelerating change -- is indeed to be accomplished.
 
T
lsat's a pretty mind-boggling topic and it's awfully inspecific.  Some sort
 
of list of items to be documented.  Your current outline is a bit too diffuse,
 
in terms of '
what would be photographed and how, to encourage hefty funding;.
 
2 -
-
Yesterday I caire across a catalogue from a photopraphic documentation
 
project undertaken by a team of Farm Security Administration photographers
 
in Ohio back in 1995.  I am sorry I can't send you my copy; it is truly
 
evocative -
-- some ,
great photopraphic work in there -- but I have xeroxed
 
off for you t
he check list outline that Roy Stryker, who directed t
he
 
project, sent his field men out with.  It's diffuse too, but within the
 
strictest of outlines, and I thought you might find it interesting.
 
I
'll also enclose your proposal in case you could find i
t useful elsewhere.
 
Please give t
ry regard$ to a
irs.  cPhetres and tell her I hope to be sexing
 
her and you, I hope, one day in t
he coming year . Before I come next time
 
I
'll write ahead, so you can advise � what I tight most usefully bring
 
along.
 
All t
he teat to you and all a
ny f
riends on Saipan, and perhaps it's not
 
too early or uneeasonal to say, 'M
erry Christmast
 
Yours,
 
Bess Lomax I

Fear Mr. McCarthy,
 
I certainly do owe you an apology.  Upon investigation, it turns out that
 
our office mis-addressed a letter that actually should and could have
 
reached you iu Ausust.
 (
See attached copy).  No one can explain why t
he
 
typist located your company in Ferrum instead of Roanoke, but she did,
 
and F
,
A-
-'re very sorry.  On the other hand, it is fortunate that you complained
 
or we uever would have known.  I don't understand why the post office so
 
rarely returns mica-addressed mail.
 
Again my sincerest regrets.  if it helps at all, this was an extremely
 
tough panel meeting with many many tines more projects that we had funds
 
to help.

Dear Mr. O
'Rourke:
 
Thank you for your letter of September 5 concerning your plans to apply for
 
grant support for next year's World Yusic Festival.
 
Since this year's Folk Arts grant application was actually put together by
 
Andy Cohen, you should acquaint yourselves as best you can with our program
 
guidelines, priorities, and application procedures before co mitting yourselves
 
to paper on the application form.
 
As you will notice in reading the enclosed application guidelines, we focus
 
our funding on authentic traditional folk artists, the best possible
 
representatives of folk art traditions and the f
rays of life of which ttey
 
are a part.  Judging from your program booklet from this year, some of those
 
artists included would f
it t
his criterion and some would not.  You probably
 
should focus your grant request to us around the thoroughly traditional parts
 
of the festival.
 
Another aspect of great interest to our advisory panelists,  t
hose who make
 
the decisions on grant applications, is the care and manner of presenting
 
the traditional artists.  The artists should be presented in a complimentary
 
way; the panelists usually look for some informational component (informative
 
program
, booklet or verbal presentations) that helps the audience best appreciate
 
the artists and their (often foreign or unfamdliar) art forms.  Cultural con-
sultants (tt}mnonusicologists, folklorists. and antl6ropologicts) can be very
 
helpful in t
his regard.  We do offer financial support for the hiring, of
 
cultural consultants.
 
You may want to contact me by telephone to talk over the type of support
 
materials we need to accompany the application form (
tentative list of
 
artists, tapes, resumes of key personnel, and so forth).  If you like, you
 
may call me person-to--person collect at 202/682-5449, leave your name and
 
number, and I will return your call as soon as I an able.
 
Sincerely,
 
Daniel Sheehy

It was great to hear of all the successes in the P
laza's folk arts workshops
 
and festival.  I only regret that I could not have been there to have s
een
 
it all in person.  I thought the program booklet was one of the }
pest I had
 
ever seen.
 
Ghat you thought in your letter is correct, we have helped fund a number of
 
folk-artist-i:s- residence projects.  I
f you have a Vlan in mind, I suggest
 
you give me a call and we can t
alk over the details.  I am sending along a
 
Folk Arts application form so that you will have one vben you need i
t.  By
 
the way, i
f you like, you can call me person-to•-persaa collect at 202/682-5444,
 
leave your name and number, and I will call you back as soon as I am able.

Dear John:
 
Bela passed your letter along to me, and i
t was ?ood to hear n
ews of you and
 
what you have been doing.  I would love to see your Peruvian filxa sometime.
 
Regards the log cabin film plans you mentioned, I have to tell you that i
f
 
t
he main file subject you have in wind dues not fit t
he description of t
he
 
t
ypo of traditional artist that our program is set up t
o fund, I doubt
 
there would be much chance of getting financial support from us.  l
ie have
 
supported a film on log cabin building in the past (
I think the subject
 
was Luther Metke), but in that case there was a strou;; argument made for
 
the artist being a t
horoughly traditional artist (
having learned in a
 
traditional maauer and so forth).
 
In any case, I e
ra sending along a copy of our most recent prox;ram guidelines
 
for your information.  If you want to talk over your p
lans further, feel free
 
to get in touch by telephone.  As always;, i
f you call me person-to-person
 
collect at 4

02/682--5449 and leave your name &ad  number, I will return your
 
call as soon as I a
ia able.
 
I am sorry we cannot seem to be of much help to you with the log cabin
 
project, but i
f you have any other i
deas, let us know.
 
Best regards.

came the enclosed listing.  Apparently, being ever true, ;ood, faithful,
 
hard working, and kind to animals, Lynn went forth and researched the problem
 
in T

ion dance, but I thought you eight find the enclosed listfng interesting„
 
if not immediately useful.

in te es of what you might call '

ane is the individual apprenticeship cate;ory
 
in which a learner who is already pretty adept at w
ixatever he/she wants
 
to study requests funds to devote a serious period cf time of apprenticing
 
with

profit organizations category, in which funds could he requested to support
 
master artists to give workshops or c
lasses for interested lea r
ners.  Please

gee the enclosed brochure for more details.

Attached is our response to your questionnaire on site visit practices in the

service organization for folk arts; we have simply persuaded the only locally-

assistance contract for us.  Also attached is a copy of the original contract,
 
which has continued at approximately the $50,000 level since then.

Subject:  Religious-affiliated grantees -- Folk Arts
 
Attached is a list of religious affiliated grantees for the past three
 
fiscal years:  FY 82, 83, 84.  You will notice the list includes several
 
colleges, particularly Berea (Kentucky) and Ferrum (Virginia).  These
 
are small colleges started with denominational moneys -- I think Berea
 
is inter-denominational and Ferrum is Methodist.  Folk Arts has given grants
 
to several other small southern colleges (
e.g. Warren Wilson and Western
 
Carolina Universities in North Carolina and Mary College in North Dakota).
 
We cannot determine from looking at the grant folder whether these fall into
 
the same category as Berea and Ferrum; they simply do not mention religious
 
affiliation anywhere, so we have not included them in the attached list.
 
Please let me know if you require any further information.

Dear Mr. Mandell:
 
This office is currently involved in litigation challenging
 
the authority of the Department of Health and Human Services to
 
award grants to religious organizations under the Adolescent
 
Family Life Act of  1981 (Pub.L. No.  97-35,  S 955,  42 U.S.C.
 
§� 300z et. seq.) for pregnancy prevention, sex education and
 
adolescent health care.
 In Chan Kendrick, et al. v. Margaret  
M. Heckler, C.A. No.  83-3175 (D.D.C. filed Oct.  26,  1983),
 
plaintiffs contend that HHS' award of grants to such groups and
 
their participation in grant programs violates the First
 
Amendment.
 
We are interested in obtaining information concerning the
 
extent to which other federal agencies disburse funds to
 
religious organizations  (
including institutions of higher
 
education) and the nature of such programs.
 Based upon our
 
research, we believe that the following program administered by
 
your agency may involve religious organizations:
 
Availability of grants, contracts and loans to nonprofit
 
organizations for the support of projects of artistic and
 
cultural significance  (20 U.S.C. S 954(c)).
 
We would appreciate your agency's confirming whether such
 
organizations have received funds under these programs and the
 
identification of specific recipients of such funds, for our
 
possible use in the defense of this litigation.
 If you are
 
aware of other programs not identified in this letter, we also
 
would appreciate such information.
 In addition, we would
 
appreciate information on any agency regulations,  instructions
 
or guidelines prohibiting use of such funds for sectarian
 
purposes.
 Because the District Court recently established a
 
schedule for the submission of facts relevant to this action, we
 
would appreciate your response as soon as possible.

in helping fund the recent National heritage Fellowship awards celebration,
 
and to inform y

that you had to miss the wxards concert at the Ford Theater; though it may
 
seers a bit immodest to bay so, it was really quite a success, and there
 
were some absolutely splendid musical performances to gr€rce the occasion.
 
I enclose a

distir►guished clarinetist, Dave Tarras, the grand old ;

Alan called me that weekend and said that Bessie Jones' funeral had been
 
beautiful, but that he was so very sorry to have missed giving; you a huh;
 
in Washington.  He thinks that the Johns Island folks ought to net together
 
with the St. Simons Island folks, and he talked to Bessie's son, Reverend
 
Jones, about it at the funeral.  Maybe something good can one day come out
 
of our sadness.  We'll hope so.  They sang "Yonder Come Jay" at her graveside;
 
it was her favorite song, you know.
 
Well, in a few weeks I will have put together a bunch of newspaper clippings
 
and photographs taken at the ceremony to send you.  I hope it will be a
 
happy keepsake

As you have -ood reason to know, the National .
,
'ndoument for the P
arts relies
 
substantially in the allocation of its fund ; upon the advice of the leaders
 
in each art form who serve on its panels.  That reliance has been made
 
possible by the wisdor and unselfish hard word: of our panelists.
 
Our objective has always been to maintain continuity in the panels and at the
 
same time to widen, so far as we can, the circle of those whose advice we
 
seek and who , in turn, are familiar with the operation of the Endowment.  For
 
this reason, we follow a policy of rotating the membership of all our panels.
 
This policy means unfortunately that every year we lose as panelists some,
 
who, live yourself , are most familiar with our programs.  It is always a hard
 
moment for us.
 
Hess Hawes tells me that you have agreed to continue acting as a consultant as
 
you have time.  That is good news indeed.  It is difficult to thank you adequately
 
for all your good counsel and help.  The Folk Arts Program and the Endoumient as
 
well remains in your debt.

Dear Ms. Hewitt,
 
This is just a note representing the exhausted but ebullient staff of the
 
Folk Arts Program thanking you again for your cooperation in helping us put
 
on the Vational Heritage Fellowship program last Friday.  We all feel that
 
the Ford Theatre was exactly t
he right choice for our bip event, and we hope
 
to be able to worm there again another year.  bray people in the audience -
,-
and the honorees as well -- expressed their pleasure in the warmth and
 
intimacy and historic resonance of the theater.  From my own perspective, i
t
 
was exactly right.
 
I also would like to express my personal and professional appreciation for
 
your technical staff, led by Tors Berra.  The resident stage and lightins
 
crews of a theater can make or break a performance almost at will, and your
 
staff chose to help us a
wake the very finest program that we could together
 
bring about, in spite of the considerable technical difficulties such a program
 
entailed.  They were absolutely first rate, a real pleasure to work with, and
 
I congratulate you and
- them for delivering
, such a professional operation in
 
the midst of a series of not very routine difficulties.  They also seemed to
 
like the program and the artists, and that hakes a lot of difference in how
 
happy the state atmosphere is.  We &I1 had a really goo.
-
i time, I thi n
:.
 
I a
na sorry that I don't remember the names of every one of your boy

.,

could circulate this note instead.  ,
And thank
is again to you yourself for a

Just a hasty note to thank you again for your
 
sterling performance as mistress of ceremonies
 
at the recent national reritage Fellowship
 
awards.  You were warm, appreciative, and
 
supportive of everyone, and your acting
 
experience enabled the rest of us to concentrate
 
on helping the awardees, knowing that you could
 
takc care of t
he stage single-handedl  Your
 
love of the material and of the people shone
 
through, and may I say you greatly improved the
 
script.  Zt was a wonderful evening.
 
Thanks again, and thanks too for all the
 
support you've ,
given the folk Arts Program
 
during your tenure on the Council.  We rely
 
on you in so many ways.

Enclosed please find a copy of the Folk Arts explanatory brochure in which there
 
is a description of the National Heritage Award program on page 13 and photographs
 
of the first year's awardees on pages 14 and 15.  I also enclose a copy of the
 
program for t
he 1984 awards, and there draw your attention especially to Margaret
 
Tafoya from your area, as well as t
he other fine artists such as Paul Tiulana
 
who were honored.  I think i
f you read through this booklet the aims and limitations
 
of the Heritage Fellowship program become quite clear.
 
We would be happy to receive nominations for distinguished Zuni traditional
 
artists.  The criteria are authenticity, excellence, and significance within
 
a traditional art form; they must also be actively practicing their art either
 
directly or as teachers.  Please remember that nomination letters must reach
 
us for our October 1 deadline; additional backup information, support letters,
 
photos and so forth can c
ome i
n a few weeks later if necessary.
 
Should you require further information, please don't hesitate to get in touch

In the meantime, I send you some news that night be of interest for future

of the Cultural Studies Research Center at the Institute of American Indian
 
Arts,as a me;aber of the advisory panel of the Folk Arts Program at the Endowment.
 
As Program Director, I am delighted at this appointment and look forward to
 
workiug with Dr. Marren during the coming year.
 
Secondly, I want to be sure that you have heard that the Endowment has presented
 
a '
rational Neritape Fellowship for 1984 to Mrs. Margaret Tafoya of the Santa
 
Clara Pueblo.  One other artist of New Mexico was also honored at the same
 
ceremony held recently in Washington, D.C. -- Sr. Cleofes Vigil of San Cristobal.
 
I enclose a copy of the 1984 ,
presentation progran as well as a copy of the
 
Folio Arts brochure that explains the purposes of the '
'
rational Heritage awards
 
and how one may make a nomination (
cf. pages 13-15).  Perhaps you would be
 
interested in helping us malce the purposes of the heritage Fellowships known
 
around your state and encouraging more nominations.  The first pages of the
 
1984 brochure and the biographies of the artists contained in its pages are a
 
good introduction.
 
If you should want any additional information, please don't hesitate to write,

This is just a note to express i
cy admiration for the fine work you and Robert
 
Garfinkle did with the slides of the crafts workers who were honored at the
 
recant National Heritage Fellowship ceremony in the Ford's Theatre.  The rea r
 
screen projection systen itself worked without a bobble and Robert handled
 
the tiudug
, of the slides themselves with finesse and elegance.  Many people
 
in the audience complimented us on the slides and said they were an outstanding
 
feature of the evening's program.
 
T also very much appreciate the initiative you took in suggesting , designing,
 
and creating the general identification sides that kept us from having to
 
stare at a large blank white screen for most of the evening.  They added
 
greatly to the warmth of the stage
., and again, many people in the audience
 
told me how pretty they were and what a nice finished quality they gave to
 
the presentation.
 
Assuming we continue this program -
-- and it seems highly likely that we will -
-
- 
we all look forward to workiag with you again.  You were professional,
 
energetic, creative. efficient. and pleasant and how on earth could we

do better than that!

Dear Mr. McKenzie:
 
I am sorry I couldn't speak with you last week.  I am also sorry that the
 
two people I bad asked to come see you have not done so.  One is a professor
 
at the University of Oregon; he had an exchange teaching job for the summer
 
and was not in town; I have a call in to him now that he is back.  The other
 
is the director of community arts services at the Oregon Arts Council.  His
 
name is Donovan Grey.  I spoke with him today and he said that he had called
 
a number of times and no one had answered during the early part of the summer
 
and then that he had been on vacation this last month.  He also said that he
 
would be in icMinnville the end of this September and would get in touch with
 
you then.
 
I hope they may have a few leads for you.  With all best wishes,
 
Sincerely,

Thank you for your letter enqutrin  about possible funding for your Cormiunity
 
Center.  I am enclosing a copy of the Cuide to the Endowment that describes
 
the overall organization of the National
. Endowment for the Arts as well as a
 
copy of the brochure describing the Folk Arts Program.  I hope you will find
 
these of interest.
 
It seems very unlikely to me t
hat most of your planned activities would come
 
under the Folk Arts guidelines, and you have probably been in existence for
 
too short a time to qualify for other programs within the Endowment.  My own
 
su Mestion would be to try for state funding.  When you apply on the federal
 
level, you have to realize that you are in competition with a huge number of
 
organizations right across the whole country.  Many times I feel people would
 
do better to work for instate support.  A letter or call to the Department of
.
 
Cultural :
resources in f
taleirli (

Dear A
ir. Hackshaw;
 
Thank you for your letter of August 8 concerning the plans for the series of
 
albums on cariso.  I tried to get in touch with you by telephone in regard to
 
your previous application through the Virgin Islands Council on the Arts, but
 
the person I spoke with seemed to want to handle all communication herself.
 
I understand that our program panelist, Hector Vega, has already been by to
 
talk with you concerning your plans.  He already may have filled you in on our
 
program policies in regard to recording's, but I will add a couple comments to
 
what you will find in our program guidelines.
 
In the past, we have directed our very limited funding toward informational
 
additions (
liner notes, informational pamphlet inserts), artists' fees,
 
attractive graphics for the album cover, some recording expenses, and the
 
involvement of professional cultural expertise in the project.  We do not
 
fund the production of the record (
the actual pressing of the disc), and our
 
panel has tended not to fund record albums over $8,000 per grant.  Also, many
 
panelists have felt that most recordings are eventually self-supporting, that
 
is if 1
,000 albums are sold at $7 each, the gross on their sales is $7,010, an
 
amount that in most cases is more than enough to support all production costs.
 
You should make clear your needs for the extra grant monies.
 
In addition to your application form, we will need a sample of the recordists
 
work and a sample (
audiotape is much preferable) of t
he artist(s) to be the
 
subject of the album.  The latter is extremely important.  Our panelists will
 
cunt to have a clear idea of the subject and the contents of the proposed album,
 
so you should also include a general outline of the music to be recorded and
 
a letter of agreement from the artist to be recorded.  Finally, we will need
 
resumes of all the key production personnel and cultural consultant.
 
If you want to talk over your plans by telephone, please feel free to call me
 
person-to-person collect at 202/682-5449.  If you leave your name and number
 
when you call, I will get back to you as soon as I am able.
 
Sincerely,
 
Daniel Sheehy

Viank you for your proposal letter concerning your financial needs to continue

; a good deal of hard
 
work into a very worthy and laudable endeavor.
 
In light of this  I feel especially regretful in having
, to tell you that w

you have proposed to our program is in all likelihood something that we would
 
not be able to fund.  Our program is set up to assist in various ways authentic
 
traditional folk artists, that is, "those artists and artisan^ who eml;race and
 
embody the collective wisdom of their cultural experience" as a member of a
 
traditional community, as it says on page 4 of the enclosed guidelines.  This
 
means, of course, that we support outstanding artists doing traditional arts
 
of their awn cultural
. tradition, as opposed to musicians, as skilled
. as they
 
may be, who specialize in Performing a
. variety of music and dance traditions
 
of other cultures.  I realize this distinction may seen insignificant, but
 
our program is so small that we simply must narrow our focus to the highest
 
priorities decided upon by our rotating panel of advisors.
 
Also, applications that come to our program are in competition at a national
 
level, and smaller projects such as yours often have a better chance of bei m
�
,
 
funded at the local level.  You may want to check back with the New 1
 exico
 
Arts Division to see if there are any further possibilities for financial
 
support from them.
 
I regret that I cannot be of much assistance to you on this occasion, but I
 
certainly hone that you are able to find assistance from some other funding; 
source.

Dear Curt:
 
It was good to hear from you in your letter of
. August 5
.  It sounds as t
hough
 
your film plans are coming along; well, and I hope the fishing was just as
 
successful.  In case you do not have one, I am sending
, along an application
 
form for you to fill out; the next deadline is October 1
, for projects that
 
begin April 1
, 1985, at the earliest.
 
I have but a few suggestions and reminders for the additional material that
 
should accompany your application.  First, I suggest you expand upon the
 
treatment of the film so that it better reflects the exact content, approach
 
and flow you have in mind.  Don't spare the detail.  The m of course, we need
 
samples of your work and the work of t
he other key production personnels be
 
sure to label the sample clearly as to who did what on each.  As best you can,
 
send samples of the film subjects -
-- film excerpts, audiotapes, and/or photos,
 
for example.  And, give us as detailed a plan as possible for the film's
 
eventual distribution.
 
One other item -- we need a letter of support from the appropriate tribal
 
representatives, unless other things you are sending us are intended to
 
suffice.
 
If you have any questions in completing the application, feel free to get in
 
touch by telephone.  If you call me person-to-person collect at 202/682-5449
 
and leave your name and number, I will return your call as soon as I am able.

Thank you for your interesting letter of August 13 with your plans for the

you do not already have them.
 
In general, i
t seems to me that your plans are developing well and what you
 
propose falls within our program guidelines.  In submitting the final appli-
cation, though, you should expand upon the details, adding additional infor-
mation on the artists and others who will be attending, the agenda for the
 
meeting, the underlying purpose, and immediate objectives.  Th i
s is not to
 
say that ghat you have already put on paper is not fine, but our advisory

expect a good deal of detail.
 
Our next application deadline is October 1

procedure or our program, .
feel free to get in touch with me by telephone.

in feference to your re marks on the proposed Folk Arts panel for FY 85, my
 
suggestion was simply to hold .
roan Lolmaugh's appointment off for one year
 
in order to benefit from Carl
.'s panel

Washington state where we have a brand new state program beginning.  We
 
already have a representative from the Rocky ?

from Colorado, but none from the Pacific Northwest.  Finally, Dave Nelson,
 
Montana State .
Arts Agency director, is a wonderful thought but he was on the
 
panel in 1978 and 1979.  I
'd love to have hire as beck--up if it's legal.
 
Unless you feel very strongly stout it, I would really preder to keep Carl
 
on for next year and put Joan on in 1986.

Dear 4
s. Ganz:
 
'Bank you for your letter of August 2 to our Folk Arts program concerning your
 
plans to record Judoo--Spanish songs.  I enclose a copy of our program guidelines
 
for your further information.
 
First, I should tell you that we give matching grants only for such projects,
 
and we fund federally non-profit organizations only.  Second, we focus our
 
very limited funds on supporting the "
first generation" authentic folk artists
 
performing music from t
heir own tradition.  (
I mention this because I get the
 
impression from your publicity materials; that your group specializes in a
 
wide variety of materials collected from a
s number of musical
. traditions.)
 
Third, we do not fund the documentation of reconstructed musical traditions
 
from t
he ancient pant.
 
In recording projects we look for the authenticity of the musical material
. to
 
be recorded and the artists  performing, the extent t
o which t
he material has
 
been recorded in the past, the need and community Interest in t
he recording,
 
and a clear plan for the distribution of the album.  Also, since many recording
 
ventures are eventually self-supporting through the sales of the records produced,
 
we gees: to have a clear sense of the need for Endowment funds.
 
Along with
. an application, we need a description of the contents of the proposed
 
album, a sample of the artists to be included, and a tape sample de-
-wnastraating
 
the technical proficiency of t
he recordis ts).
 
I
f, after perusing our progran guidelines, ;
you have any f
urther questions con-
cerning my comments or our program, you may get in touch with me by telephone
 
by calling 202/682--5449, person-to--person collect, to me, and then leave y

Dear Mr. Rittenband:
 
Thank you for your letter of July 26.
 There is no reason why an individual
 
can not be nominated for a National Heritage Fellowship more than once; indeed,
 
since nominations are open to the public,there is no way that we could prevent
 
artists from being nominated more than once even if we wanted to!
 
However,  I think I should tell you that our current panel did not feel that
 
Sol K. Bright Sr., while obviously an important Hawaiian artist, was himself
 
a folk artist.
 It appeared to them that he is a first-class professional
 
musician and song writer, and that he should be strongly considered for the
 
awards or honors that pertain to that division of the arts- world.
 It is quite
 
possible, of course, that they were in error and that another panel would-think
 
differently; that is why we rotate panels membership annually.  However,  I
 
believe if you read the enclosed highlighted bulletin that explains the Folk
 
Arts Program you will understand more clearly the way that this program defines
 
the somewhat debatable term, "folk".
 
Finally, please understand that this is only the third year in which these
 
awards have been offered.
 It is unlike any other such program in the world
 
including the famous Japanese national treasures program.  We have no rules
 
about state representation.  We have no rules about representation of parti-
cular ethnicities or artistic disciplines either.  Perhaps we will have to
 
make some up, but for now we are just trying to honor a few of the marvellous
 
folk artists in this country as fast as we can in as joyful a way as we can.
 
We have not as yet received nominations from a great many states.
 I hope
 
eventually we will.
 In the meantime, I would hate to see us fail to honor
 
fine artists who happen to be resident in the same state, while we wait for
 
an appropriate nomination from somewhere else.
 
I hope this letter answers some of your questions.
 If not, please don't
 
hesitate to write again.
 
cerely,

Dear Ab.
 
Thank you for your nice letter of July 20.  I
'm awfully sorry. but book
 
subventions fall outside our purview, as you will see in the annotated
 
copy of our brochure, (
page 1d) ,
 This is an Arts Endowmeut -
wide posture,
 
by the way, with only the rarest of exceptio n
s to be found in the Literature
 
Program only.  The theory behind the proscription is that books (
except literary
 
works) are in the realm of the National Endowment for t
he Humanities and we
 
shouldn't poach
. in their stream.  However, there is a Catch 22, of course:
 
the National Endowment for the
 the last time I looked, only helps,
 
with occasional publishing costs, those special books that stem out of Humanities
 
funded research projects.  So there we -- and you, I
'm afraid -- are.
 
I don't know how many tines I
've written exactly this same letter.  I don't know
 
any place to recormend that you go for help on this issue either.  Most founda-
tions also seem to feel that offering to }
pick up extra casts in publishing
 
would result in their drowning in a sea of applications, and that t
he only
 
feasible way to ho is for every author and publisher to ^o to the mat themselves
 
and fight the costs of the bock out like j
 entlenter
. and ladies.  That is, :
[ ?uess,
 
the way it always worker' before grants became fashionable.
 
Please don't cross }
yolk Arts off your list for this turn--dove.  It was a
 
pleasure to hear from you, and I look forward to seeing the book.  Please
 
put me down for an early copy (
and bill me, of course).

Raul Anorve,
 
Thank you for your letter of July 22.  I am undertaking an answer since Dan
 
Sheehy is presently out of town and will not be i

The next Folk Arts application deadline, however. is not until October 1
, so
 
there will be plenty of time for him to get in touch with you upon his return.
 
In the mean time, I thought you might litre to have a copy of the program's
 
guidelines, they also contain the necessary
 app
licat
ion  forma
 so  that you could
 
begin deciding how you will fill then: out.
 
You will notice that you will need a non-profit sponsoring organization
., and
 
you will need to develop a fifty--fifty match either from that organization
 
or from other sources of funding.  Part of the match, of course, can be donated
 
labor and supplies of various kinds.  You might even want to consider whether
 
you can afford to donate back into the project part of your projected salaries,
 
since on t
he surface they are greater than the artists` fees.  (of course you
 
way be planning other additional forms of compensation for the artists.)  1011
 
will also need to discuss how the record will be produced and distributed.  I
 
shall enclose a copy of a check list we have formulated for individuals wanting
 
to produce: recordirW
 s
.  All the points may not apply to your project but you
.
 
may want to consider them.
 
When Dan returns to the office, I shall ash
, him to get in
 
away, since your project i
s so c
learly within his special
 
Le may have additional ideas to discuss with you.  In the
 
to me that you have a feasible project that would tend to
 
guidelines.  I wish you the
y best of success with it.

for s
taff and
 
panel use only, of course).  A song or two from each singer would probably be
 
all that would be necessary, and i
t would make i
t possible perhaps for Dan to
 
advise you more exactly as t

Dear Mr. Golden:
 
Thank you for your Proposal letter of July 5 to our Polk Arts program regarding
 
your plans for the Salt City £olk Festival.
 
Unfortunately, i
t does not appear that we will be able to be of assistance
 
to you on this occasion.  First, our upcoming grant cycle does not a
llow
 
for monies to be available until April of 19R5, and our program does not
 
fund projects retroactively.
 
Second, not all that goes by the label "
folk' is included within the scope
 
of our pros
 rata guidelines.  The Puncl± and .
Judy puppet show, the washboard
 
and jug group, and several
. of the other performances you have listed probably
 
would not be eligible for funding by our program.  As you may see from a
 
careful reading of t
he enclosed Polk Arts brochure, we focus our funding; on
 
authentic practitioners of folk arts traditions, those who in most cases
 
have been brought up within a traditional community, learning
; the repertory
 
from their own seniors and absorbing the s
tyle as they live the life that
 
the style and the repertory represent.
 
Third, i
t does not appear that you are employing
, a folk arts professional
 
(
e.g., folklorist or etlinomusicologist) in the development and carrying
, out
 
of your festival.  Just as the Visual Arts Program, Museums Program, Theatrc
 
Program, and other Endowment discipline programs look for t
op-crotch expertise
 
in their fields in evaluating
; proposals,
 so  do our program panelists loot:
 
for professional f
olk arts expertise.
 
Even though funding for the upcoming festival seems out of the question
 
at this point, perhaps you would like to plan for the following year's
 
event, i
f there is to be one.  If you would like to discuss your plans by
 
telephone, please do not hesitate to rive me a call at 202/682-5449.

Dear Dr. Petrovich and Professor Ramirez de Comas,
 
Thank you for your letter of June 20th to our Chairman, Mr. F
.S.M. Nodsoll.
 
I am responding to your request on his behalf.
 
Since we fund a great diversity of projects -- festivals, workshop series,
 
films, radio programs, apprenticeships, regional folk arts coordinators, and
 
many other unlike projects, there is no "ideal proposal" that I can refer to
 
in giving you a critique of your own proposal, as you requested.  We do,
 
though, need a clear, detailed budget, a thorough explanation of the project
 
plans, a clear idea of who the artists are and the quality and traditional
 
authenticity of their work
..  '
.
'
such of this information will not fit on the
 
application form and must be added in the fore of addenda.  You did this in
 
your proposal.  In your case, though, as I remember, there were discrepancies
 
in the budgets between t
he figures on the application form and the amplified
 
budget addendum.  Also lacking were sufficient details on the festival
 
component of your plans and how the traditional artists fit in with all the
 
rest.  Also, in this regard,  many of the artists included in the festival
 
budget, though in most cases presented in the fora of match, did not seem
 
to be traditional artists.
 
Other than these few observations, there is not much else I have to suggest
 
to you other than to keep in touch with our office in the for mlation of
 
project plans and to make certain that the project is carried out successfully.
 
As to the latter, our program panelist, T
a
r. Hector Vega, should be in touch
 
with you in the near future (
if he has not already done so) to find out how
 
things went on the current grant.

Irs. Henry, there are only six of us Mere in Folk Arts handling all the grants
 
we give out (
about $3,000,000 worth a year) and hundreds of nominations besides.
 
We've only done this Fellowship business twice before, and we've had t
o make
 
up the rules for how to work it as we go along.  There hasn't been anybody to
 
tell us how, and we are still experimenting.  The first two years notifying
 
the selected nominees was just done by Smithsonian and Folk Arts staff menber
.s
 
over the telephone.  It was only this year that we decided it '
light be nice to
 
try having the nominators do it, and we may go back to the old system, since
 
we've had to spend so much time explaining to people why so and so did it
 
rather than somebody else.  In your case, Tom McGowan had sent in so r
iuch of
 
the backup material on Yrs. Cook that his name popped into my head instead of
 
yours, and I
'r really sorry about it.  I didn't check the files, and I s
hould
 
have.  I don't know what else to say.
 
Finally, ue don't send out any formal
 
any to send out.  I write a letter t
o
 
grant application to sign and return,
 
awards cere mny is held, we dive them
 
announcements to anybody
, we don't have
 
each of the recipients and send then a

Dear Gloria:
 
In accordance with the general policies of the '
.
'ational Endowment for the Arts,
 
the folk Arts Program relies heavily upon the process of peer evaluation as
 
the key step in the awarding of grants.  Our advisory panels are rotating
 
congregations of distinguished and knowledgeable scholars, artists, and savants;
 
their independent reco mendations to the Chairman ensure that our grants-making
 
process is both honorable and responsive to the current state of the art.
 
The requirement that we rotate panelists and that we balance the resulting
 
panels strictly according to geography, expertise, and ahhost of other factors
 
is probably wise, but invariably hard on the Prograr staff who come to rely
 
upon experienced panelists such as yourself.  As Program Director, I would
 
line to say that your particular contribution for the past three years has
 
been of real weight and substance and it wakes the composition of this letter
 
an expecially difficult task
..
 
Speakin
.g both for the Program
, staff and the ongoing panelists thank
. you for
 
your fairness, your expertise, and your dedication during your past years of
 
service on the panel.  I am enclosing
, a fear of t
he products that your hard work
 
made possible; I hope they will make you feel proud.  And I hope too that you
 
will continue to allow t
he Folk Arts Program to call on you for the occasional
 
site visit or just for general advice and counsel.  It has been a pleasure to
 
work with you, and we will keel+ in touch.

Dear Nancy,
 
As you have good reason to know, the Falk Arts Program, like all other
 
programs in the Endowment, relies heavily on the process of peer evaluation

congregations of distinguished and knowledgeable scholars, artists, and
 
savants.  Their independent recommendations to the Chairman ensure that our
 
grants-making process is both honorable and responsive to the current state
 
of the arts.
 
The three year limitation on the term of any panelist is probably wise
., but
 
always hard on the Program staff, who come to rely upon senior panelists
 
for t
,,
eneral advice and counsel.  Besides, we always get to be such good
 
friends that, even thou
 ;h we know we will
. continue to meet both professionally
 
and socially, there is always a sense of loss when we visualize future panel

 It wakes the

I hope you will continue to allow us to call on you for the occasional site

Subject:  Heritage Foundation Slur
 
In FY 82 Folk Arts gave a matching grant of $3,000 to the Southern Folk
 
Cultural Revival Project.  The application was reviewed by the Folk
. Arts
 
panel in December of 19£1 and by the National Council in February of 1982.
 
The grant description reads as follows:
 
"Support for honoraria for a special presentation of old-time
 
traditional fiddlers in Buddy Spicher's Nashville Fiddle Festival,
 
a blue--grass event."
 
The longer grant description read, in part:
 
"
....a unique opportunity to present traditional fiddlers to
 
audiences who may be seared to more contemporary performances
  
an experiment.... showing the continuity of traditional players a
-ad
 
the more contemporary (e.g. commercial) fiddlers...."
 
As it actually turned out, between the time the grant was awarded and the time
 
scheduled for the Nashville Fiddle Festival, the latter event was cancelled.
 
Folly Arts received a request from the Southern Folk Festival Revival Project
 
asking permission to %ritch the old-time fiddlers presentation to their
 
Tennessee Crass Roots Day Festival in Nashville.  We okayed the request,
 
and the program went on as planned with a total of $5,400 in musicians' tees
 
going to seven old--timers and a
. group of accompanying side-musicians.
 (One
 
of the fiddlers included was To m
my Jarrell, who was to receive a b
.ational
 
Heritage Fellowship in 1982.)
 
The blue grass and Nashville sound audiences are generally quite ignorant of
 
the older country unam}lified fiddle and banjo musical style.  The panel
 
argued over the grant request, wondering if Spicer could not pay for it 1
-
Airaself
 
out of gate receipts, but decided at the end that this would be a worthy effort
 
to enlarge the audience for old-time traditional fiddle players, and one which,
 
it was expected, would generate future support by setting a new progra ming
 
recedent.

At the risk of sounding querulous, three years a?o I did suggest the Pacific
 
Festival of arts and Cultures be placed on a similar State Department List.
 
Admittedly the Festival occurs only every four years, so perhaps that disqualified
 
it, still, this is the year when it should have teen listed and indeed is actually
 
taking
.
, place.
 
In four core years, I would again recommend the State Department pay some
 
attention to the Pacific Festival.  Until then, neither Dan nor I can think
 
of any major international events exclusively devoted to folk arts, there
 
may be an ,
African Diaspora Festival in Brazil in future, but p
lans 
 are not

Dear Ira Neal
 
Thank you for your proposal letter of June 6 to our Folk Arts Program concerning
 
your plans for a minority heritage program in your school system.
 
Unfortunately, judging from your letter, your plans do not fit our program
 
guidelines.  We fund strictly fold; arts presentations that involve authentic,
 
high quality folk artists, our program's primary constituents.  For a more
 
detailed programmatic definition of what makes arts folk arts, please see the
 
enclosed folk arts brochure.  Your plans as put forth in your letter are
 
drawn along the lines of general ethnic heritage, which is much more inclusive
 
than folk tradition,  Also, your budget compares very much on the high side,
 
in the context of our small program.
 
If, after reading the brochure, you have questions concerning our program
 
and what it has to offer, please do not hesitate to get tuck in touch.  My
 
telephone number is 202/€82-5449.
 
You Might went to contact the state folk arts coordinator at the Indiana Arts
 
Co mission, Jeff G &hardt, to see if they can be of any assistance to you.
 
His phone is 317/232--1268.
 
I regret I cannot be of much help to you or

Just a personal observation -- I of course am not familiar with the detail
 
of your proposed project, but marriage customs have been extensively studied
 
and your best d

Your request is approved.  Please consider this letter as official notice to
 
that effect.
