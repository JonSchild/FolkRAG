Ed Barnes Transcription.   
 
This interview begins before Deborah Fant turned on the recorder.  Ed Barnes was ready and rarin' to 
go. D. Fant asked about the Labor Roundtable Breakfast that had been held earlier that Friday morning, 
January 18, 2013, which she attended before returning to the Clark County Historical Museum for the 
interview with Ed Barnes.  The interview begins in the middle of his answer: 
 
EB:  . . . Southwest Washington, and that, and it (the Labor Roundtable)  was started because a lot of 
businesses just didn't want to come to a straight labor, like at the Labor Council meetings or the building 
trades. So in order to broaden our base, we needed to get other people involved. And this morning 
you've seen that we had county commissioners there, we had city council members there, we had port 
commissioners there, there were some people there, the labor council people, building trades people.  
So it just, school board people show up, administrators for the hospitals in town, school district, 
congressmen, senators, a whole lot of different people come there.  And they feel more comfortable 
talking to a diverse crowd that has more than just plain labor folks, I think.  They have a tendency to 
open up more.  You probably heard that this morning, people were more willing, Debbie, to say things at 
that meeting that they might not say at just a regular union function. 
 
DF:  So, it's generally known as the Labor Roundtable? 
 
EF:  Yep, it's generally known as Labor Roundtable, Southwest Washington.  And they have annually, a 
Labor Roundtable banquet where they award awards to the business leader of the year, the union labor 
leader of the year, the labor organization of the year, community activist of the year.  They do four 
awards jointly between the Labor Roundtable and the Labor Council, and they award these to various 
people for their activity in the community. 
 
DF:  And the Labor Roundtable meets where? 
 
EB:  The Country Buffet, which is located across from Vancouver Mall.  They meet the second and fourth 
Fridays of every month.  
 
DF:  At 7:30 in the morning.   
 
EB:  7:30 in the morning.  The breakfast starts, and the business meeting starts at 8:00.  And it usually is 
supposed to get over by 9:00, but most of the time it goes to 9:30 or 10.  All the different people making 
reports and comments, questions being asked, which you observed this morning, different comments 
people made and other people ask questions of those individuals.   
 
DF:  Yeah, it underscored how involved labor is in community affairs in supporting Vancouver. 
 
Interview with Ed Barnes

EB:  Yeah, and one of them was the Historic Museum right here in Vancouver, which we've been pushing 
on.  And of course, the AFL-CIO is going to be here this year for their annual convention at the same 
time the museum is going to have a labor exhibit.  And various different unions are putting money into 
that.  Building trades unions have come in here and spent a lot of time and effort to completely revamp 
the upstairs, basically, of the museum, to make it a lot better for the community.  And it's all been free.  
The materials and the labor, basically, has cost the museum nothing. And we do this, have done this, for 
years in Clark County.  The labor movement donating their time and labor, money. 
 
DF: So, Ed, tell me a little bit about yourself and your work life. 
 
EB:  How do you want me to start? 
 
DF:  You live in Vancouver?  How long have you lived here? 
 
EB:  Since 1945. Basically, how we got here, you have to understand my dad was an electrician too.  And 
he was working for DuPont in Morgantown, West Virginia, at a big plant there.  And when the war, just 
before the war got started, they told dad that he was going to have to go to a place called Richland, 
Washington. And the only place he'd ever been was in West Virginia and Kentucky.  Maybe a little bit 
out in Tennessee. So he said, well, how do I get my family there?  And they said, you don't. So they tried 
to explain to him why he couldn't, and it was because the place that he was going to be working was at 
Hanford. We found out later that he was one of the key persons involved in the development of the 
parts for the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima/Nagasaki.  Because he was, as an electrician, he 
became an expert in DC (direct current) drives.  And this  was a very important part of them running 
their equipment, their machines at Hanford.  And also Knoxville, Tennessee. So during the war, he would 
come out, and he would ride on the Dark Train coming out. 
 
0:05:18.1 DF:  What's the Dark Train? 
 
EB:  Well, they covered up all the windows and stuff so that nobody seen the train running.  So that if 
the Germans or the Japanese decided to bomb the trains, they wouldn't be able to see when they were 
running or weren't running. So he'd come out here and work for three months, then he'd come back 
home.  And we'd pick him up at Pittsburgh, where the train would come in, bring him home, and he's 
home for a couple of weeks, then he'd come back. Well, when the war was over, he didn't want us boys 
to become coal miners, get killed in the mines, because he started working in the mines when he was 13 
years old. He got shot twice when he was trying to help John L. Lewis organize the mines in 1922. And 
the mines. . . he carried those bullets to his grave.  So he said to my mom, the kids aren't going to 
become miners, we're going to go where the huntin' and fishin' is good!  And, of course, my older 
brother and my older sister were married, and had their families in West Virginia.  And he said, "We're 
leaving."  So he bought a 1934 truck. And one of the other electricians and a guy called Base Knight 
helped him renovate this truck. They got that truck all fixed up.  They put sides on it, and a mattress in 
the back of it, and we became like the Okies and the Arkies and started across the country.  And he 
would stop at different locations and go into the IBEW union halls and work a little bit. So we headed 
across the country.   
 
0:07:01.3 My mom's brother had worked, or sister-in-law, had worked at the Kaiser Shipyard in 
Vancouver all during the war. And they had a house here in Vancouver. So we headed to Vancouver. 
There was no work here. We stayed for a while, then dad kept checking with the union hall over at Local 
48 in Portland, Oregon.  They finally told him that they had a job that he could probably go on, which 
Interview with Ed Barnes

was a big plywood plant at Riddle, Oregon. It was Harbor Plywood building this plant. So we went down 
there and we lived in a 12-man military tent with wooden sides on it, wooden floor. It had a stove in the 
back for heating, and a cook stove, wood cook stove out front.  And it had a community shower. And 
dad worked in that plywood plant because he knew the DC.  The only reason why he got to go there 
because he was an expert on DC, and they didn't have very many people who knew how to do DC work.  
 
0:08:04.9 DF:  So, "DC" is direct current? (“Direct current.”)  You said DC drives.  What are DC drives? 
 
EB: Well, that a motor that they have a controller on that they can control the speed.  Either make it 
faster or slower, to speed up the process. So, anyway Dad got this job down there and we stayed there, 
worked on that until the job was finishing up. And when we left, we got up here, it was the height of the 
Vanport Flood. I don't know if you've ever heard about Vanport? They had a city called Vanport, which 
was located out here right off the Interstate [5] bridge between Portland and Vancouver.  It was the 
second-largest city in the state of Oregon. And it was all families that were working at Oregon Ship and 
Kaiser Shipyard. And, we come back up here, and we'd just got across the river when one of the dikes 
went out.  The Denver Dike went out.  We'd just got back across the river when the dike went out.  The 
Columbia River had got so high, that it washed Vanport away.  It completely washed the whole town 
down the river.  Everything.  All the buildings. And when that happened, then all the paper mills, the 
industrial work along the river, all opened up to where there was jobs for electricians to work at. We 
stayed here, I did most of my childhood on what they call Railroad Avenue.  It was right down west of 
here, between 13th and 14th Streets, in a two-story house that was built, I think, probably in the 1800s. 
It's no longer there, it caught on fire and burned down. But, I went to Haug School, Shumway, and then 
to Vancouver High School. And then got taken into military service for the Korean Conflict. And when 
that was over, my military service, I come back. . . 
 
DF:  What branch of the service were you in? 
 
EB: The Army. In the Army.  25th Division, 27th Wolfhound Regiment, Third Battalion, Company I.  
"Longest in Korea, never failed a mission, never lost a position." That was their story.  So, anyway, come 
back out of the service, and at that time my dad was in charge of all the electrical work on the Dalles 
Dam, built the new Dalles Dam. So when I come back out, he wanted to know what I was gonna do.  And 
I said, “I haven't the slightest idea.”  He said, “Well, do you want to become an apprentice electrician?”  I 
said, “Well, what's that?”  Even though I knew he was an electrician, I didn't know what becoming an 
apprentice electrician was, basically.  He said, basically, it was a gofer. You go for this, you go for that for 
the journeymen.  Whatever they want, you've got to do. So I said, well, it just sounds like the military! 
(laughs)  
 
0:11:22.7 EB: So anyway, went to the union hall, and there was little. . .  My dad was a very outspoken 
person. And so if things weren't right. . .and because he had been a charter member of the local in 
Fairmont, West VIrginia, in the IBEW.  So he pretty much knew what the rules were.  And he had 
disagreements with the leadership of Local 48  at that time.  And so when I went down to get a dispatch. 
. .And the guy who was running, the superintendent or project manager from West Virginia, for 
Donovon Construction Company, had told me, "You just go to the union hall and they'll give you a 
dispatch.”  Because I didn't want to go to work unless I had something from the union authorizing me to 
go to work.  I just didn't want to go out there and say, put me to work.  So when I went to the hall, the 
person that was the business manager at that time, Hub Harrison, said, "We're not gonna give you a 
dispatch to go to work."  (Because of your father?) Yeah, because of the disagreements my dad had had 
with them. Anyway, I went downstairs in the old union hall in Portland and I called. . .cause they had 
Interview with Ed Barnes

given me the phone number, and I called back, and I don't know whether they anticipated there would 
be some problems, but they give me Bookman's telephone number. I called up and said, Bookman, I 
said, they won't give me a dispatch.  And he said, you just wait for about 15 minutes and go back 
upstairs.  You'll go to work."  And anyway, I waited the 15 minutes, I went back upstairs, they wrote out 
a dispatch and give it to me.  That was the beginning of my electrical trade.  
 
0:13:06.0 I thank God I had the military experience because I got the GI Bill to go to school on, which I 
think was a tremendous, terrific thing for anybody coming out of the service to have that opportunity. 
So I went, my apprenticeship at Clark College, here in Vancouver. They had an apprenticeship training 
facility there.  Then my dad said, “You can't just be a card carrier.  You've got to be a union member, 
you've got to participate, be active.”  So I got active in the union.  The first assignment I got was, a 
person at that time, the locals didn't have a payroll deduction for union dues. Or political action stuff. So 
they had what they called a Committee on Political Education, which was a national committee, the AFL-
CIO. The IBEW was part of that. So the International decided that each local union had to have a 
registrar. None of the current members of 489 wanted to be a registrar in the local. So they thought, 
well, we'll stick Ed, because I think what had happened to dad.  See if I fell flat on my face, I guess. Well, 
I started pushing the COPE, selling the COPE tickets. . . 
 
DF: What was COPE? 
 
EB:  COPE. COmmittee on Political Education. (okay)  Yep, yep.  We started pushing that, and just selling 
the $2 tickets wasn't enough to raise much money, so I got the idea that we would start raffling off rifles 
and shotguns for hunters.  Because most of the building trades peoples are adamant hunters and 
fishermen.  So we did fishing stuff, we did hunting stuff.  And then when televisions started getting 
popular, we started buying televisions to raffle them off. Joe Thompson, one of the people that actually 
was the founder of the Labor Roundtable here, which was with the aluminum workers and the 
steelworkers, he was the head guy down in here.  And he was also the head of the Labor Council at that 
time. He had a Cadillac that he completely renovated. One of the Cadillacs with big fins on the back of 
it? He completely renovated it. And I was talking to him and he says, “Ed,” he says, “I'll give you that 
Cadillac for what I've got in on the Cadillac.” He said, “What it cost me to renovate it.” And so I paid him 
$1600 for this Cadillac. So every time we had a meeting for a year, whether it was a meeting in San 
Francisco or Washington , D.C., where I was at a convention or anything, I took these COPE tickets with 
me and I took these special tickets for a raffle.  I sold raffle tickets for the rifles, the car, everything.  And 
a guy in Sacramento won this Cadillac. He drove up here--no, he flew up. And he drove the car back. 
(What year was that?) It was nineteen and 73, 74.  And then the rifles, we had guys that won in Billings, 
Montana, won one of the rifles. Because I was selling tickets everywhere.  We got to where we were the 
biggest contributor of COPE dollars out of the whole IBEW. (WOW) Money that went back to the 
International. 
 
0:16:55.8 EB: From there I run for the Executive Board.  I got elected to the Executive Board in 1963.  
Well, I actually completed my apprenticeship in '59. As an apprentice, I was working, doing all of this 
COPE stuff. And doing every picnic, helping put all of the picnics and stuff on. And then in '63 I got 
elected to the executive board, and also I was a delegate to the first international convention in 
Montreal, Canada, which was something unheard of.  To see a new person out-poll the existing people 
that had been in the locals.  Anyway, I got elected to that, and I've been to 13 IBEW conventions since 
then. So anyway, I started that and from there I became a vice president in the local union.  The 
president, and then was the dispatcher in a local, a business rep, and became the business manager of 
local 48 for several years. And at the same time, I was the president of the Columbia Pacific Building 
Interview with Ed Barnes

Trades Council, which, Portland/Vancouver area.  I di that for about 18 years. So, because of my 
activities with the union, I had an opportunity to help elect mayors on both sides of the river, governors 
on both sides of the river, congressmen, senators.   
 
DF:  "Both sides of the river" is the Columbia?   (Yeah, Portland, Vancouver) 
 
And several different people that I helped get elected into office by campaigning for them, getting the 
membership to campaign for them. And you can't do anything unless you have the membership 100% 
behind you. A lot of people take full credit for everything, I just, you just can't do that. Without their 
support, you wouldn't even get elected to serve an office. So I stayed, all these different political 
activities, I've been to two conventions, or two Inaugurations, one for Bill Clinton, and one for Obama. 
And that.  Just fact, yesterday we were at the inauguration of Jay Inlslee in Olympia (newly elected 
governor of the state of Washington). Just very good. 
 
0:19:38.6  EB: And then, when I retired in '95, I was very good friends with Mike Lowry, which became 
the governor of the state of Washington.  He called me up and he said, "Ed, you can't retire.  You're too 
young to retire. You need to do something."  And, of course, at that time I'd been pushing really hard 
about doing something with the traffic problem between Portland-Vancouver. The first bridge was the 
1917 bridge, the next bridge was built in 1958, and so, anyway, the traffic--our guys going back and forth 
to work from Vancouver to Portland, the traffic would get so bad that the worker would be late for 
work. And when he was late for work two or three times, the contractor would lay him off for being late, 
or you'd end up in labor management for the guy because, you know, there's nothing you can do if 
you're sitting out there in traffic.  They weren't getting a paycheck for a full paycheck.  And then they 
couldn't get home at night to see their kids at little league and any kind of activity, musical activity or 
anything else, cause they might get home at 6:30,  7:00 at night because of the traffic mess.  So anyway, 
I'd been complaining to the Department of Transportation about that, fussing with them over that, for 
quite a few years. So, he asked me if I'd be willing to serve as the Transportation Commissioner for the 
State of Washington. So, anyway, the first one ever appointed from Southwest Washington.  And I 
jumped at the opportunity to do that!  And I served as the Transportation Commissioner for 12 years.  
 
I was very well acquainted with Booth Gardner, Gary Locke, Christine, all the different governors over 
here in the state of Washington.  The governors over there--Barbara Roberts, Neil Goldschmidt, you 
know, just helped push a lot of people.  Lessa Coyne, worked for Ron Wyden, over on the Oregon side.  
Earl Blumenauer, over here, every one of them, Brian Baird, Patty Murray.  When I first started getting 
involved in politics here locally, Bob Schaffer, which was the youngest speaker of the Washington State 
House of Representatives, lived here in Vancouver.  So every one of the Democratic functions he'd go to, 
or conventions, I'd always drive him in my station wagon.  So I was his chauffeur to Spokane or 
whatever.  Denny Hecht, which just now is the new congressman, they were here.  Dean Sutherland, we 
put him in office by supporting him. Al Bauer, Val Ogden, the whole list of 'em goes on and on.  Joe King, 
he lived in our neighborhood. We got Joe King elected, got him Speaker of the House, the Washington 
State House. Mike was very good.  And all of 'em. I've had a good relationship with all of those people. 
Due to the fact of being part of the Electric Workers Union, 48. And the membership give me the 
opportunity to support them.  
 
0:23:10.6 In the case of Booth, Denny Hecht, we had a meeting in Spokane going on with the Electric 
Workers Association.  And we were the first union that Denny Hecht convinced.  And I went in along 
with Dave Jordan, the business manager of 46 in Seattle, to convince the state association that we jump 
ship different than the AFL-CIO. Because they were backing McDermott for governor, and we just 
Interview with Ed Barnes 
6 
 
decided we needed a different way instead of creating more jobs from the conversation.  I think both of 
them are great people.  We supported them both, but we got the state association to endorse Booth.  
And after that, he ended up. . . and I even spoke at the AFL-CIO convention in favor of John Spellman 
over an individual from Vancouver who was running for governor on the Republican ticket. That owned 
a lumber mill down here on the river that was an open shop.  And he wasn't in favor of unions, he was in 
favor of right to work and all the rest of that. So you had to pick the lesser of two evils. And so I got up 
and spoke in favor of John Spellman and got him the endorsement out of the AFL-CIO in the state of 
Washington. Sometimes you've got to speak up and not be bashful. It's been interesting times. 
 
0:24:45.9 DF:  I'm very ignorant about how unions work and what they do.  So you mentioned as you 
were coming up through the unions, you had different jobs, different roles.  You were a dispatcher at 
one point, and you were a business manager at one point. Tell me what those jobs are and what do you 
do to do those jobs, and how do you do them well? 
 
EB:  Well, what it is, you've got to represent all the members.  You can't have favoritism when you're a 
dispatcher. And in the old days, it was up to the dispatcher if he had people he was more friends with, or 
somebody that he worked with, that the foremen jobs or superintendent jobs or general foremen jobs 
would get passed on to his friends.  At one time, different fashions, whether it was the Knights of 
Columbus, whether it was the Masons, or whether it was the Moose or the Elks, and that's why I never, 
ever joined any of those organizations! The only organization I've every belonged to has been the 
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.  That way, I wasn't beholden to anybody to use their 
relationship with that club to become, to get a job.  
 
The dispatcher, what you had to do was to make sure that people you were dispatching out to a 
contractor, you went by the book system.  And they had Book 1, Book 2, Book 3, Book 4. And Book 1 
was the Journeymen Blue Card electricians, Book 2 was the traveling Blue Card electricians that would 
come in from all over the country and signed in, Book 3 were open shop people that signed it, and from 
there on down.  So you would start with Book 1 people. I always tried to make sure that the person with 
the highest number would get the right to take the job or refuse the job. And then you'd go down to the 
next person, next person. But you'd always offer them the opportunity, but you'd tell them what the job 
required.  So that if they couldn't meet those requirements, or felt that they couldn't do the job, they 
would refuse it.  And that way you would put "refused" in the book.  And the date that they refused it, 
and the time.  And you'd go to the next person, you'd keep going down until you would fill that call.  It 
was an opportunity to treat everybody equally.  
 
0:27:15.6 DF: So, if an electrician refused a job, did that, was that a mark against him?  Or it was. . . 
 
EB:  Well, when I first went in there as a dispatcher, you never kept marks.  And then it got the point 
where people would start trying, they knew certain jobs were coming up.  So I changed the dispatch 
system to a three strikes and you're out--you go back to the bottom of the book.  You had three 
opportunities to take a call.  And what they would do, they would wait around. Cherry pick.  I hate the 
term, but that was what they'd do. In order to pick all the jobs that were bigger jobs, or overtime jobs.  
And in between, would just go fishing or hunting or whatever they wanted to do.  So, it wasn't fair, it 
wasn't fair to the other folks on the book.  So anyway, I changed it to a three-strike program.  They had 
to either take the third call or they'd lose their place.  And if there was 400 people on the book, after 
you were sitting on the book for a year, then they'd be number 401.  And they didn't like that at all, 
some of them didn't like that at all. But the majority of them did.  So they thought that was really good, 
when I changed that.  When I became business manager.   
Interview with Ed Barnes 
7 
 
 
0:28:38.4 And then, a business rep.  A business representative.  You worked for the business manager.  
He would have you assigned to different areas.  My first area that I was assigned to was Vancouver and 
upriver, which took care of Klickitat and Skamania Counties. And all of the Vancouver side of the river. 
Then as business manager, you oversee eleven and a half counties in Oregon, and three counties in 
southwest Washington. And at the time I became business manager, we had about 1735 members in 
the local. But that's when things were just absolutely terrible.  In '83 we had only about 700 or 800 of 
those people working, equivalent of full-time.  So the rest of them were either drawing unemployment 
or out of unemployment.  So I built a relationship with the other local unions in the Pacific Northwest 
and throughout the country to where I could call them on the phone and say, would you please Joe or 
Susan or whatever it was.  And dispatch them right directly from here to New York.  At one time I had, as 
our membership built up, I had 100 people working Local 3 in New York.  And I had people working in 
Oakland, California.  I had 'em working in Colorado. Minnesota.  Any place I could get 'em a place to put 
them to work.  These guys and gals would go there and go to work, New Jersey.   
 
And then, as our work picked up, and we were able to go from about a 40% union control of the market, 
we got up to the high 80s.  And that was due to the fact that we started what they call Market Recovery 
Program.  Which is a program where the membership participate and how that all come about, a lot of 
the members ended up in financial problems.  They were losing their houses, some of the guys ended 
up, the gals would end up in divorces. And so, I went to the membership without the blessing of the 
International.  Because I had heard when I was at a meeting in Washington DC that a local union in 
Rapid City, South Dakota, had started a market retention program in order to recover the union without 
the approval of the International. And then 124 in Kansas City did the same thing. So I talked to both 
those business managers to find out how the program worked. 
 
DF:  And what does that mean, a market recovery. . . 
 
EB:  Well, what it meant was that the, you got the contractors to agree to withhold a certain amount of 
money out of their paycheck.  And we started out with a 3-1/2%.  But in order to do that, I had to make 
a presentation to the membership and show them, hey guys, we can all go to work.  You guys can all go 
to work, you can stay here with your families, but you're going to have to use a dues increase of 3-1/2%. 
And what we did with that. . .And originally, we didn't start the market recovery that way.  Originally 
what I did was, every other person that was dispatched out of the hall would go out at a lesser wage in 
order to be able to average the wage against the open shop. And that caused a whole lotta hate and 
discontent, because the person would say, "Hey, I'm as good as Joe or Ed," but they were drawing full 
journeymen's pay according to the agreement, and “I'm only getting $3, or $4 or $5 less.”  We did that 
for a year.  And that got some work back. But it wasn't the same thing.   
 
And the next thing I did, we had an agreement that was a three-year agreement.  I cut the wages 
automatically without the members.  I told the membership I cut their wages back $3 an hour in order 
to be able to compete with the open shop.  Because we'd lost a big project here to Fluor Daniels and 
Zachry and them for oil modules to go to Alaska. And they started monkeying around with the state law, 
and putting in what they called a "module license," to where anybody, didn't even have to be an 
electrician, you just bought all these $10 licenses.  People would come in from all over the country to do 
the work. I went to the membership, and we had over 750 people at the meeting.  And I explained to 
them how the market recovery was going to work.  And I told them it was against the constitutions, 
against our bylaws and that, if anybody in this group files charges against me or notifies the 
International, I'll be history.  So, anyway, you always have your detectors, people that don't like you for 
Interview with Ed Barnes

one reason or another.  So, at this meeting, the 753, if I remember correctly, that voted, there was 9 of 
these individuals that voted against market recovery.  The rest of them all voted to support what I 
wanted to do. Because I'd asked 'em, and explained to them, and I knew my membership was at stake 
according to the constitution.  
 
But I also had a little thing in the back of my mind that the International Secretary, Jack Moore, had 
been the business manager of 124 in Kansas City and was aware of this program. And I'd had a little 
conversation with him, so I thought, well, I didn't want to rat on him by him knowing the program 
existed.  But I wanted to make sure that I could protect the membership, and not have the membership 
of the local taken over by the International.  We instituted a program, and these individuals not only 
filed charges with the International, but they filed them with the National Labor Relations Board.  They 
filed charges everywhere that they could file them. The ABC, the National Right to Work, they filed 
charges.  Everybody filed charges.   
 
About two weeks later, I got a call from the International Vice President, Jack McCann, out of the 9th 
District Office, saying, "What in the world's name, " well, he didn't use that kind of language, but. . 
.anyway, "I'm coming up to remove you from office."  I said, well, that's the way it goes.  He come up, 
and I'd taken all my credit cards, everything that had to do with the local, the books and everything, I 
laid them on the front of my desk. And the sad part about it is, one of the people served on my 
negotiating committee was the son of the International rep that had his office right next to mine. My 
local union office on the second floor of the Lloyd Center.  We had our office there for 11 years. 
Herman's office, right next to mine, he knew all about it, his son did. Got up and spoke on behalf of the 
market recovery at the meeting we had. When Jack come up, come in and sat down in the office, and 
wanted to know what the hell I was doing.  So I told him what was going on.  He said, "Well, you've 
violated the constitution."  And what I did too, I took a big piece of paper and I wrote, I didn't write the 
name of the International Secretary on it, but I wrote his telephone number in Washington DC in big 
letters with an ink marking pencil, on a big piece of paper, laid it down on top of the stuff on my desk. 
And after I explained to Jack what was going on, well, "What fool would do something like this when 
you're going to lose your membership?" and on and on.  
 
Anyway, when he got through ranting and raving, I said, well, I've got the E Board, an executive board 
room, and I said I've told them what's going on, and I said, if you remove me, you can go in and meet 
them or they, or you can appoint somebody, the executive board can appoint somebody to take my 
place."  But I said, "There's a phone number laying in front of you.”  And why I did this was that Jack 
McCann and Jack Moore had both lived and raised in Springfield, MO.  Both of them played basketball 
and football and everything against each other.  They were very well acquainted.  They were good 
friends.  So I knew that he knew what the phone number was automatically, when he read this phone 
number. So I got up and walked out and went into the E Board room.  And for a half hour, maybe 35 
minutes, nobody knocked on the door saying, "Come out!"  Pretty soon I heard the door closing going 
out onto the mezzanine, at the Lloyd Center, closing, slamming closed.  And nobody knocked on the 
door. 
 
 And pretty soon my office manager, Josephine, come and knocked on the door.  And she said, “Well, 
the International Vice President left!” And he had Gill Duffy, his executive assistant, with him.  And she 
said, "They left."  And I said, "Oh, they did?" So I went back in my office.  And Herman's door was closed, 
my door was open.  So I walked in there, and everything that he had looked at was laying on the desk.  
Well, what he had done, he'd called Jack Moore. And Jack Moore told him what was going on. Never 
heard another peep out of him until I got a call from the International Office saying, and that was about 
Interview with Ed Barnes

maybe a month later, that was in September, saying, "Ed, Mr. Business Manager, we're going to send 
you a letter in writing.  You're to appear in such and such a date in the International Office, in Charlie 
Bellard's office in Washington, DC, on such and such a date, to explain your actions as the Business 
Manger of 48.”   
 
So, anyway, I loaded up, went back to Washington, DC, and at that time I had the attorneys for National 
Electrical Contractors Association, Bill Liberski and Don Richardson, our attorney, had done a lot of 
researching on market recovery.  Whether it was legal, whether it was illegal, whether it violated Taft-
Hartley, Landrum-Griffin, whether it violated RICO Act, all of these different acts. Plus, the contractors 
had signed a petition.  Every employer had signed a petition, if I was removed from office, that they 
would automatically cancel their agreements with the IBEW.  Every contractor!  (laughs)  So, anyway, I 
took all this information with me, and I went back to Washington DC, and I got my room at the Hyatt. So, 
the next day I go into the office, and the first thing that Charlie Park, very big guy, very outspoken, 
become very good friends. And he, again, he used more than "what the hell?"  He used some other 
words. So they had the attorney for not only the local union or the International but the attorneys that 
we had, the International attorney that represented the national building trades. And so, they wanted to 
also hear what this program was all about. It was a tool that they could use against the open shop.  And, 
like I say, we were just a little over 40% when I started this program.  
 
So, I was there for a full week, going through all the legal stuff, talking to their attorneys, talking to 
Bellard.  The last day, he called me back in and he says, "Go home."  He says, "We will get in contact 
with you to let you know what action we're going to take against you for violating this section, this 
section, this section, of the Constitution, your bylaws, and that."  I come back home, and it was almost 
six months later before I ever got a communication.  It was a letter signed by Poullard saying that, 
“We're going to approve your using this program for a year.  If the program fails, then we'll take 
whatever appropriate action that we need to take.”  So, we went to, and we initiated it, and we'd 
already been banking, we'd already been putting the money in the bank.  We'd already subsidized the 
thing.   
 
And ABC filed a charge against us for collusion, between _____ and the IBEW, contractors named, that 
we were paying the contractors off, and that it was a violation of all of these different federal laws.  
Well, by the time the process went through all this legal stuff, went clear through the local courts and 
everything, went to the Supreme Court, they ruled in our favor.  That market recovery was legal.  That 
we had the right, that the contractors had the right to protect our jobs.  So when we did this, and got 
this ruling, all these other locals had been doing the same thing, everybody was given the blessing to go 
and do it.  And we went from a 41-42% up to a high of 83% membership.  When I left office, we had over 
3700 members in the local union.  Most of it was construction, but we also represented radio, television, 
ports, the marine, city, county, and we were able to do a better job of getting that.   
 
And we got open shop contractors actually come into the hall.  Call me up and come in the hall.  And we 
would sit down with all their employees at the union meeting hall and the contractor would get up and 
say, Far West Electric was one of them, Capitol Electric, the Omni Electric.  They'd bring their troops in, 
they would set up at the front table with me and say, "I've decided, fellows, I'm going to go union with 
the electrical workers."  Because they couldn't compete against our market recovery.  We were taking 
their contracts away from them. So they told their members, “Anybody that doesn't want to join, there 
the door is. I appreciate your working for me, but I got to look out for my business.”  So we signed up I 
don't know how many new contractors.  I think we had 80 contractors when I started, and I think when 
we left we were about 150 employers.   
Interview with Ed Barnes

0:43:55.3 And we did all the advertising--billboards, radio, television.  And I'd gotten acquainted with Bill 
Schonely, which was the announcer for the Portland Trailblazers, through a guy named John Clark.  And 
Bill did all of our television, radio advertising.  And we bought a big billboard in the Blazer arena that 
advertised the IBEW. And we sent out all kinds of mailings to the general contractors.  It was a great 
relationship between. . .without the National Electrical Contractors Association and the IBEW working as 
close as they have here.  We set the labor management pattern for the whole country, what we did 
here.   
 
0:44:43.4 So, then we went to a five-year apprenticeship program, which I got in trouble for, without 
asking that we did that. 
 
DF:  You went from what to what? 
 
EB: From a four-year to a five-year program.  And what we did that for was so that we could pick up the 
Sound and Com business. Because if you look at the telephone directory, you'll find out even today that 
most of the Sound and Com stuff was still open shop. So, I was able to start recruiting the first Sound 
and Com contractor in Portland, Christensen Electric signed a big one. 
 
DF:  Sound and com?  Sound and communications?  
 
EB:  Sound and communications contract.  and then CCI, a big outfit out of Seattle, was double-breasted 
up there.  We got them to sign for the work at Intel, they were working at Intel, which is one of the 
biggest, huge project that we've got going now. It's got half the local working at it. 
 
DF:  What's "double breasted?" 
 
EB:  Well, that they had a union shop and an open shop, both.  And a lot of 'em try to start that.  
Cochran out of Seattle tried to start a nonunion shop down here, and I convinced him with market 
recovery that that was the wrong thing to do. So we got them to sign up, and then they eventually 
bought out a shop called Broadway Electric, so that it was Broadway Cochran, and now it's just 
Broadway.  But the Cochran family had been doing very well down here with their shop, a lot of work.  
 
0:46:14.4 EB: The other big one was, I was the chairman of the Health and Welfare Trust.  We were 
seeing all these folks that, the Harris Electric Workers Trust, I was the chairman of that. And the 
expenses of drug rehab and alcohol also, wives with broken noses, kids with ribs, husbands getting beat 
up with baseball bats, and the like.  I could see the handwriting on the wall, because I'd worked enough 
on the job to know that people come to work that were so inebriated that they couldn't perform.  You'd 
either send 'em home or some of the people would hide 'em out in the electrical switch rooms, which 
was not right.  So I set down with NECA, and we negotiated the first construction alcohol substance 
abuse testing in the whole IBEW construction industry. Did pre-employment for drug testing on the job 
for cause, we did out-house treatment, which meant going to night classes at night, and in-house 
treatment, provided for what the health and welfare.  And made sure that they all put this drug program 
into effect. And all the general contractors, everybody jumped on it.  The rest of the trades here all have 
drug and alcohol programs.  And Intel, the big companies like Intel and Boeing and them, will not, if you 
get caught, they make mandatory drug testing.  They do periodic, what do you call? surprise drug 
testing.  If you get tested, you'll never work on an Intel site here again. Or a Boeing site. So, we 
instituted that.  And the health and welfare costs went way down.  We had one lady so upset at her 
Interview with Ed Barnes 
11 
 
husband because he beat up and whacked on her all the time, she tied him up in a sheet and took a 
baseball bat and about broke every bone in his body.  And that was the straw that broke the camel's 
back with the health and welfare deal, to get the health and welfare started.  But I got in trouble with 
that.  I was going to get removed for that, and "You immediately get that out of the agreement!"  and I 
said no.   
 
0:48:48.3 EB:  And then I started an industry fund.  And the industry fund was between NECA and the 
IBEW.  (And NECA is?) National Electrical Contractors Association. They get their share of the money, we 
get our share of the money, and we use that share of the money, it's a payroll deduction, which we 
never had before. And when you try to get guys to just donate the money, it's a lot harder than when 
they're taking ten cents an hour out of their hourly paycheck to go into, for political action.  And then I 
set up a situation where some people might have an objection, a religious objection to doing it that way. 
I picked out 18 nonprofits.  And we give them an opportunity that they can pick a nonprofit.  So at the 
end of the year, the local gives them a receipt of how much money they've donated to United Good 
Neighbors, Salvation Army, whatever it is, and they're able to deduct that from their taxes at the end of 
the year. We were able to work around the problem that people had with the COPE money. It just has 
worked very well. 
 
We both, then we hired—Tim Gauthier—I  hired a fellow that I went to school with, a fellow here in 
Vancouver, high school.  He became a professor here at Clark College in communications, and that.  
Named Orv Iverson.  And we needed to have a better working relationship between the contractors and 
the members, because there was all this bickering. “You don't have good tools, your trucks are falling 
apart!”  Or the contractors would say, "You don't work, that's why we lay you off."  Or one thing or 
another. So, I talked him into, we interviewed Orv to see if he would work out to hire him to help us 
communicate with all the contractors, all the members. And so he paid $500, and I paid $500 out of my 
pocket, a thousand bucks to hire Orv to do this.  And so, at the apprenticeship school, we had some of 
the small contractors come in, and some of the big contractors come in, at different times, and all the 
big contractors wanted to come by themselves. And not invite the little or the medium-sized 
contractors. But I mixed it all up.  And the same way with the guys, the shoppies that work permanently 
for the shifts.  The contractor, they call them shoppies, and the other guys were people who worked off 
the book.  So anyway. 
 
DF:  "Worked off the book."  What does that mean? 
 
EB: Well, that's somebody that doesn't work permanently for a shop.  Maybe just works job to job.  And 
a contractor, soon as the job is over, will lay them off.  And some of the folks stay as a steady workforce, 
working for that contractor, 20, 30, 40 years until they retire, you know.  So, anyway, we were able to sit 
down and get Orv to invite them in to the apprenticeship school. And we went through every member 
of the local and every contractor at these meetings, and some of the meetings got really wild.  The guys 
making comments against the contractor, the contractor making comments.  But at the end of this 
whole process, Orv put a book together. The local's got a copy of it, and the contractors have it. It's been 
circulated several different places. He put down 10 things that the local could do to make a relationship 
better, 10 things the contractors could do themselves. And then 5 things that the two of us need to 
work on jointly. And one of them was political action at the legislature, both in Oregon, Washington, 
joint bills that had to do with apprenticeship, with licensing, workers' comp, unemployment comp, and 
things like this.  So we put this process together, and the actions that the local did would be required in 
order for us to educate, to make sure that we let the membership know that the contractors weren't 
their enemies. Because at the time I was in there, 95% of the contractors, all had come through the 
Interview with Ed Barnes 
12 
 
apprenticeship program, became a journeyman, foreman, a superintendent, then became a shop owner 
or bought out a shop that they were working for when the owner retired. So it was an interesting 
process. By virtue of that, we got rid of a whole lot of this animosity between the contractors and the 
members and the relationship. . . . 
 
And then we put out T-shirts with a joint handshake on it. I shoulda brought one of them so that you 
could see what it is.  It took me about four or five months to work up a design for this joint handshake.  
And the contractor's part has a suit coat on, and the construction worker has a construction coat on.  
But it's a handshake, and it reminds you similar to the AFL-CIO handshake between the AFL and CIO?  So 
we put this together, and all the company trucks drive around with this on it.  The guys would wear it on 
their hats, their hardhats.  They had a logo on their hardhats.  The guys wear it on their T-shirts out to 
the job sites.  So we promoted the industry as an industry. And the general contractors loved that.  They 
really loved that joint labor/management cooperation. Various different things like those programs that 
we instituted went on. 
 
0:54:28.7 EB:  And then when I retired in '95, shortly after that, the industry got together.  Which was a 
big surprise that I didn't have any idea.  Every St. Patrick's Day, the original chapter manager for NECA 
that I started working with, was involved with him when I was still just president of the local and 
business rep and dispatcher, was a guy named Bob Burns. And he was an Irishman with a real sense of 
humor. First time him and I ever had a meeting, he'd listen to what Hub Harrison, the business manager 
said, that I was a troublemaker and all this kind of stuff, and so he, we had a joint labor/management 
meeting when I got put on the joint labor/management committee, no, it was a negotiating committee.  
And he walked up to me and he says, "No so-and-so hillbilly from West Virginia's gonna tell us how to 
run our business."  In my West Virgina, you don't call somebody a son-of-a, whatever it is. And so I told 
him, I said, "Mr. Burns," I said,  I want to tell you respectfully that you've got about ten seconds to 
retract that or you're gonna get punched really hard, right where it hurts!" And he looked at me and he 
says, "What?" I said, "That's right.  I'm gonna knock you just flat on your rear end, cause nobody calls my 
mother that."  And he says, "You're serious!"  And I said, "Yes, I am." And so from that point on, we had 
a great working relationship.  
 
0:56:08.7 Then his assistant, Tim Gauthier, became the chapter manager.  And then, like I say, when I 
retired, I went to the St. Patrick's party that Bob had put on every year.  So after I retired, they put on 
one of these parties.  And they have the Bob Burns award that they give every year to an industry 
person.  And so they presented me as the Bob Burns Award, the first time a labor person had ever been 
given this award! The following year, due to the fact that everything worked, that was the only time 
they ever had two people, and they named it the Barnes Labor Management Committee.  Everybody 
started copying.  So about three years ago, or four years ago, one of the people that had became the 
president of the NECA chapter and also national officer of NECA had really, Oregon Electric Company.  
The guy owns seven electrical shops, all of 'em union.  He started his business with his dad, and that. So 
anyway, I asked the joint labor management people if they would change the name of the Barnes Labor 
Management, if they would call it the Barnes Allison or Allison Barnes Labor Management committee.  
So they voted to do that. So now the committee says Barnes Allison.  They still left my name in the front, 
but Buzzy's there behind. But now they have another logo. So they've got a nice plaque in local 48 with 
the original logo.  I give them the original paperwork about the logo.  Well, it's enshrined in a thing, and 
it's got my picture on one side and Buzzy's on the other side.  
 
0:57:58.8 But, I could not have done what I did without the support of the membership.  Period.  It just 
would have never happened.  And you would have been a one-termer business manager.  But I was 
Interview with Ed Barnes 
13 
 
always honest with 'em, I went to ''em with everything, let 'em know just exactly what was going on.  
Even though I had my detractors, and that, that basically would file charges over anything that they 
could file.  They filed over the drug program, they filed over the apprenticeship program. They filed over 
anything that they could file it over. But every union, every union has a group of people who don't agree 
with the leadership. At one time, I was probably one of those people who didn't agree with the 
leadership! And so I felt the only way I could make changes was to become the leader.  And that's what I 
did.  And I served on the Council for Industrial Relations in Washington, DC, for the IBEW and NECA.  And 
that's what it is.  If there's a local dispute, locally they try to settle it between the two of them. And they 
call it an interim committee, which is made up of one international rep and one NECA rep, try to resolve 
it.  If it isn't resolved, it goes back to Washington, DC.  They have a 22-member board back there, and 
the decision has to come out of there unanimously. It can't come out partially.  It has to be voted on by 
both parties unanimously, each, 11 on each side. So I served on that for five years.  So, it just. . .  
 
I also was elected at the International convention to represent the marine industry, maritime industry, 
for the iBEW. And that and negotiations with G.E. and Westinghouse and all these countries in New 
York, we'd have negotiations and stuff.  The IBEW has been good to me and my wife, especially has been 
tremendous.  I mean, she, without her giving me the opportunity to take the time and I raised three 
boys, probably neglected some of them.  All three of them are members of the local union now.   
 
DF:  They electricians too? 
 
EB:  Electricians too. And I have a grandson that's a material handler now, and a son-in-law that's a 
material handler.  An apprentice. 
 
DF:  What's your wife's name? 
 
EB:  Luanne.  L U A N N E.  All one word. I think the reason why she was so lenient with me, her dad was 
a plumber.  And he was the president of the plumber's union, Local 51 in Oregon. So she understood a 
little bit of the deal that went with.  And, 'course, I did the 4H and the Little League and the Boy Scouts, I 
did all those things with the boys. Even though I didn't get much sleep some nights. I had horses in the 
4H and sometimes they didn't clean the horses up, I'd end up having to do that.  And then they'd decide 
to get cows. And so we had 21 whiteface cows.  Anyway, then they got into motorcycles, chasing the 
ladies, and so the cows got sold, and the horses got sold.  And I have 7 grandkids now, so it's been a 
great life.  A lot of volunteer projects.   
 
1:01:28.4 The advertising firm that we used, started out at Brown & Dugan, it was one of the bigger 
outfits in Portland.  They were related to Jack McKennon, the owner of Tyson Electric.  So we used them 
to do the advertising.  And then they decided to part companies, and one of the ladies that was an 
employee there, Mary [Tahone?], took over and started [Tahone?] advertising.  And if you go to The 
Grotto [Note: National Sanctuary of our Sorrowful Mother, known as The Grotto] down here at 
Christmas time, the second only, it was only the second lighted grotto in the United States. And we do it 
every year, the IBEW and contractors donate all the material, beautiful lighting display.  We lighted the 
Morrison Street Bridge, we did the Twin Towers on the Convention Center in Portland, all those 
different projects that I showed you the pictures of? Those projects, Scouters Mountain where they 
have the Girl Scout and Boy Scout camp, rewired all of those different programs.  Put in ball field 
lighting.  All the Little Leagues in the Portland/Vancouver area, we put the lighting  poles up and did all 
the lighting on all those Little League fields.  We had that.  Scoreboards.  And so it's been. . . 
 
Interview with Ed Barnes 
14 
 
And the Mayor of Vancouver, Royce Pollard, appointed me as the representative for the state of 
Washington for bringing light rail to the Portland International Airport. So I served on a five-member 
committee to do that when I was the Commissioner, when I served as the Commissioner in the state of 
Washington.  We got light rail to Portland International Airport.  And then I also served as the Treasurer 
for building the Hilton Hotel, down here, for the PFD Board, the Public Facility Board. The time that they 
put that package together. 
 
And it's all because of the union.  Because of being involved with the union.  And the membership 
allowing me that opportunity.  And our local is neat because we belong to the Chamber of Commerce 
here, which nobody else does.  We have a relationship there.  We can have a conversation with the 
executive secretary.  We belong to the Economic Development Committee.  We belong to Clark County 
Identity.  All these different organizations we belong to. That way we have an opportunity to meet with 
the business people of the community.  Phil Parker, which took my place, you met him this morning, he 
serves on the work force development.  I couldn't do it all!  So, give it to Phil.  And when I left the 
transportation commission, I was able to convince the governor to appoint Phil in my place, keep an 
electrician in there.  He's done a great job.  
 
1:04:31.7 We built the Tacoma Narrow Bridge.  I was the guy that made the motion to build that bridge. 
The guy that supported the T______ passenger trains, when nobody else did. In fact, inside some of the 
train cars that we built up in Portland, I mean Seattle, in the inside, before they put the trim on, I got my 
autograph signed in there.  So if they ever take them apart, they'll see my name, dated, and stuff in 
there.  But it was all because of the union. The building trades.  The labor council, and that.  I'm not 
bashful about it.  Everybody in the community knows who I am and what I am. 
 
1:05:09.2 EB: And then my last big thing that I think got a lot of notoriety for the union was the local 
down here, the local area, the National Historic Trust, for the last eight years has had, what they call 
Dancing with the Local Stars.  So the gal that was in charge of that for the Reserve come to me and said, 
"Ed, you know we've never had a union person participate.  It's always been business people or people 
in business that have participated in that.  We'd like to see you get involved in it."  So anyway, I asked 
her what was involved, talked to her a little bit.  And then I talked to a couple other people that had 
been.  . . and Dean Southerland had been one of the first to do this, but it was a little bit different then.  
They didn't have to raise money in order to be part of it.  It was just kind of a dance competition. So, 
anyway, I talked to him, and another individual that had been one of the participants.  So anyway, they 
talked me into doing that.  So that was in June of last year.  And from June until September the 15th, 
when they had the competition, I had to, went out and had to raise money, but also learn how to dance.  
Because I'd never danced before.  
 
And they used Arthur Murray's dance studio. And they give me a very talented young 21-year-old dancer 
to dance with. And at 79 years old, you can imagine!  Four feet, and I told her when I talked to her, I 
said, "I hope you have steel-toed shoes!"  She started laughing.  And so I never stepped on her feet the 
whole time that I danced with her.  I made sure of that. We did the fox trot, by Cab Calloway, was the 
song. And so we did the dance. On the 15th of September, and the competition.  And all the dancers 
were out trying to raise money for the Historic Reserve to help maintain it (NOTE:  This is the Fort 
Vancouver Historic Reserve, a 19th century fort on the banks of the Columbia River).  And they have a 
Red Cross building down there that they want to restore.  They now have control of the academy, which 
I don't know if you've been by it or not, it's the big Catholic school down here.  You'll see it, I'll give you 
some material here.  You'll see it if you go by, if you go down to the Historic Reserve, you'll go down by 
the Academy. It's a huge big facility.  It was an all-girls school.  One of the first girlfriends I had when I 
Interview with Ed Barnes 
15 
 
was in high school was a gal that went there.  And we went to the Fort.  And all the boys, after school 
was out, we'd run down the street, and we'd stand across the street because the Mother Superior and 
them, they'd stand out and say, "You guys get outta here! Quit bothering our girls!" So, anyway, the girls 
would get out of school, and they'd go 2-3 blocks away and you'd be able to talk to 'em. They now have 
that.  
 
And so, anyway. . . some of the people they had were all real estate or worked for the BIA or something 
else like that, or different companies.  So I went out and did my thing.  I went to IBEW, the first place I 
went, and said, "Hey guys, gals, I need some help!"  And they come, they did very well.  And so then I 
started individual contacts of both labor and business.  And people I worked with on these various 
different things throughout the years and that, put a thing in their hand to raise money.  And so you had 
to raise a minimum of $5000. If you didn't, you had to take it outta your pocket.  And I was bound and 
determined that I wasn't going to have to take any money out. So I went out and raised money.   
 
So, the 15th, when they had the fundraiser, they had all of us stand up on the stage.  And there's about 
420 people at this function, at the Air Museum. So anyway, they had the previous winner, they 
announced who he was, and he had a crown.  And then they had these trophies for the best entrance, 
the most unique dance, and various different things they give trophies for. . . the most talented, and 
they had the big trophy for the winner of the Dancing with the Stars, which was a combination of 
dancing and also raising money.  So anyway, when the guy walked back behind us all, he went down and 
then he walked halfway back up, and I figured well, you know, somebody else, and then he turned 
around.  And I didn't realize he come back and stood behind me.  And he put this crown on my head!  
And then they made the announcement that Ed had raised $25,600! Out of the $115,000 that had been 
raised.  And so in my comments to the public, I thanked  them, but I thanked my wife, but I also thanked 
the IBEW and the middle-class people for helping me raise these funds. So anyway, that was a lifetime 
experience that very few people get the opportunity to compete in. It was something that the union 
folks had an opportunity for the first time to be part of. I hope that somebody else this year from the 
unions get an opportunity to compete in it. It'll be interesting. 
 
DF:  Have you danced with Luanne, then? 
 
EB:  No, we haven't had a chance to get out and dance yet. (laughs)  She's a Sweet Adeline person.  She's 
been in Sweet Adelines for 26 years, in fact. I'll be driving her to Boise for the western regional 
competition, and I've supported her with the Sweet Adelines.  She's went to Europe, she went back for 
the 4th of July celebration to DC and they sang there.  They sang at the Statue of Liberty.  They've sang 
several different places. But, The Grotto, for, and when we started The Grotto 26 years ago, now, when 
Mary come to us and Tim and I agreed to do it, she sang there, I think, 23 years, if their group has sang 
there every Christmastime along with hundreds of other groups that sang. Yeah, it's been a very nice 
relationship.  And she's allowed me to do a whole lotta things with the union. And the Democratic Party. 
 
1:11:52.3 I was born a Democrat. I was born in the labor movement. And one of the things,  my 
childhood. . . I was born in Maysville, West Virginia, but shortly after that my dad, and the miners that 
had been starving to death back there, got the opportunity to build the first WPA project that Franklin 
Roosevelt built.  It was called Arthurdale. And so when that was built, for the first time in our life we 
lived in a house that had running water.  We lived in a house that had electricity. They provided three 
acres of land with a cow, a horse, chicken and a pig.  Supposed to be self-containing in that.  And so, 
once every five years or so, we go back and visit the people back there.  My best friend that I went to 
school with, Glenn Luzier, is still alive.  We go visit them in their house back there.  Burn and his wife

Rose were my mom and dad's best friends, the y mined together and then organized together.  And so, 
it's . . . But the WPA, that project is still there.  They're restoring it back to its original thing because they 
had a fire there. And they just restored one of the buildings.  So if you ever get to West Virginia, all of 
the history at the, West Virginia University has the big history on how they built it.  And there's a big 
mansion sitting up on the hill. And Eleanor Roosevelt, that was one of her favorite places to come. And 
she stayed there, and she would come down, and I won't, can't verify this, but I'm quite sure that she 
bounced me off of her knee. Because she'd come in and she would read stories to the kids in the 
classroom and that. And my dad's picture is on the museum wall back there as one of the founders of 
Arthurdale.  So it's nice, the family history got a nice book from them. And every year we donate, just 
like you donate to other charities, you donate money to help do that.  And I hope my kids follow 
through with that one. We go meet our Maker one of these days, so, . . . 
 
1:14:01.5 And Luanne, she was born in Deadwood, South Dakota.  In the coal fields of Deadwood. And 
her dad was a pipefitter in the mines.  And then when the war started, they come out here and he 
worked Kaiser Shipyard--Oregon Shipyard, not Kaiser, but Oregon Ship. But union has given a whole lot 
of people good opportunities.  He was a mineworker. The hardrock mine union back in South Dakota. 
Yeah, it's been a great life.  
 
And, like I say, just do everything I can do to promote union, and union people. Candidates that support 
unions.  I'll go to any length to support 'em. If they don't support the unions, they're not going to get my 
support, even though I deal with them.  Currently we have a congresswoman here, Jamie Herrera-
Butler, that doesn't see eye-to-eye with the labor movement.  And I've sat down and talked with her 
about transportation issues, about Columbia River crossing.  And she's dragging her feet.  If she'd come 
out and do what she's supposed to do, we could get the money necessary from the federal government 
and from the state legislature in Washington in order to build that bridge with Oregon.  And it would 
create 14,000 jobs here in the Portland-Vancouver area, that project will.  
 
I mean, with the way it goes right now, and I don't know whether you're aware of it or not, one of the 
things that really concerns me, and I've been bringing it up wherever I can, that the fifth largest 
employer in Clark County now is Intel in Hillsboro.  And if you threw Boeing at Gresham in there, and 
you put Nike, and you put Solar World, and Fred Meyers and Safeway, these different companies that 
have their warehousing here--you threw them in, the largest employer in Clark County is the tri-county 
area over in Oregon. And they're all going over there to pay Oregon taxes.  And why aren't we working 
over here? Having jobs over here to put people to work?  
 
And people just keep fighting everything that comes along, like they're fighting the bridge, like they're 
fighting the light rail to keep it from coming over here.  And I think that it's just absolutely imperative 
that we get that bridge done so that we could create economic development.  We've got plenty of 
industrial land here to bring people here.  It'll help the ports out in order to get their stuff shipped in and 
out of the port of Vancouver. Port of Portland, back and forth between.  And the thing of it is, the bridge 
is sitting in 50-foot pilings.  It's not into bedrock.  It's another 100 feet into bedrock. The bridge is a 
dangerous bridge, and that.  And so if an earthquake happened here, that bridge would come down, 
there'd be a whole lot of people hurt. So, it needs to get rebuilt.  It needs to create some economic 
development.  The raising of the bridge all the time, the traffic gets backed up, and the people. . .  Again, 
like I told you originally, the traffic goes clear to Hazel Dell in the morning when the people are trying to 
get across the bridge. And they've got. . .  
 
Interview with Ed Barnes

My three boys, Brian, Brad, and Bruce, have never worked over here, basically, in Washington.  They've 
worked in Oregon.  Brian, my oldest one, has never worked over here, and he's 54. Working the whole 
time, he's worked at either  EC, Oregon Electric, Christensen Electric, all these different contractors, but 
all their work's been over there.  Brad, my middle boy, has never worked over here.  He's worked in 
Oregon the whole time. And Bruce, he was fortunate in some ways. He hasn't worked in Oregon the 
whole time because he was working all over the world wiring up embassies for the United States 
Government, everywhere.  Where they had to wear bullet-proof vests and see people die and 
everything else like that.  
 
But we've done nothing.  And my dad used to have a great saying, "Vancouver is a great place to raise 
your kids, go to church, put 'em into school, but a hell of a poor place to make a living."  And the other 
thing, when we first come here, people don't realize it. We had a carborundum plant here, a big 
carborundum plant, industrial plant.  We had two aluminum plants. Jansen Knitting Mill.  We had Del 
Monte Cannery. We had, we had huge amount of industrial jobs here that employed good people, made 
good money, good benefits.  Every one of those things are gone.  Boise Cascade, a paper mill, they're all 
shut down and gone, and so if anybody wants to work, they gotta go over to Oregon.  And anybody that 
opposes that bridge, as far as I'm concerned, they're promoting the Chamber of Commerce in Oregon, 
to take and get the people over there to pay taxes. Income tax over there so they don't have to raise 
their taxes in Oregon.  But it's not doing us any good over here. And I used to represent both sides of the 
river. For years.  And I see both sides of it. But we need work over here, put people over here.   
 
And currently, the projects that are over here, if it wasn't for transportation, Highway 14, St. John's 
Interchange, 134th, 139th, 503 to Battleground, the Port of Vancouver, there would be no work here if it 
wasn't for government dollars, taxpayer dollars being spent here. Because none, there's no other 
businesses coming her to locate.  Hospitals, Washington State University, all things that are big.  And my 
philosophy has always been, the only way that small business--they say that small business creates all 
the jobs--the only way they do that is when big business and big government do well, and there are 
subcontractors to those businesses. Otherwise, if they don't do well, you can see what the economy's 
done here in the United States. Because of that.  And they say, well, small business. . .they don't create 
it. Unless there's an environment with big business and big government to do it.  Boeing. You wouldn't 
have the work that you have up in Seattle if it wasn't for Boeing.  Or the 520 bridge. Or the Alaska 
Viaduct. All those projects up there. Spokane Freeway. I mean, you look all over--I-90. You look 
anywhere you want to look.  
 
It's, we just need to get this mentality of people against government. . . And then, ones that are against 
government, in this community, have government contracts. And you say to them, they're bashing 
government, and then you say to them, "Well, you've got a government contract!"  "Well, that's 
different!"  Well, what's different about it?  "Well, it's my work, it's my business." I said, "Well, my god. 
Think about the other people, the public employees that are working for state government. They're 
doing the job so that you can have these contracts that you have."  So it just burns me up to see people 
bashing public employees.  And I used to see both sides of it, 'cause I represented both the public entity 
and private contractors and radio/television, and so, you can see a whole lot of it.   
 
1:21:10.8 And the newspapers, now, are so one-sided it's absolutely pathetic. There's not a, I don't think 
there's a non-biased newspaper.  Every article that they write, this one here, The Columbian, is no 
different.  I served on the advisory board for The Columbian for three years until they decided they 
didn't want union participation anymore, and they went nonunion.  And so the union doesn't have a 
voice unless we're able to set up a meeting once a year with them, if you're lucky, to sit down with the 
Interview with Ed Barnes

editor and the owner and them, and discuss the labor issues. But every editorial they write about the 
unions, they write it in such a way that there's always some slam towards public employees, or in some 
way, or against the union in some way. And I've tried to tell Scott, I've known Scott. He was the 
chairman of that Kaiser Tower when we built the tower, and he give, patted the unions on the back for 
how tremendous that they were.  And when they built their new headquarters, it was done all union. 
Done by a union contractor and all union subcontractors. He wanted the best. He didn't want flakey 
work.  But they still bash the unions all the time. 
 
1:22:25.8 But anyway, the project here at the museum has been, went to the City, and Susan [Note: 
Susan Tissot, Executive Director of the Clark County Historical Museum] asked me to line up the building 
trades for that project.  And I went to the various different unions to get them to participate in here, 
including mine.  So right now, a lot of good people working on this.  My local union, I think, has made a 
donation, I don't know what it is for sure so I won't say, but I think Wednesday night they made a 
sizeable donation to the AFL-CIO effort when they come here.  So anyway, that'll get publicized pretty 
quick, I hope. And so, but, I was very instrumental, and the mayor, Pollard, was very instrumental in 
making sure that the Hilton Hotel went union, become a union hotel, the only one that we have in this 
area.  
 
DF:  That's quite, quite an extraordinary list of contributions. I mean, it's, sounds like a life well lived in 
service, of your, of everyone around you, through union work. 
 
1:23:46.1 EB: Anyway, it's people like yourself, that's going to get the message out.  You know, 
everybody don't know it unless we put it in writing or put it on the radio or television.  So you have to 
have people like yourself that are willing to support the union. Harry Bridges, we donate money. Our 
PAC donates money, I don't know if we've done it this year yet or not, but soon as we get the notice we 
always send money up there.  And I've been up to a couple of their programs up there, and that's one 
other thing.  I'm one of the only construction worker in the United States, I think, that got the Harry 
Bridges Award.  
 
DF:  Oh, my. When did you get that? 
 
EB: I want to say, about like 19 and . . .God, I'd have to go back and look at the placque. I think it was 
about 1982 or 83, somewhere in there.  They had the presentation over in Portland and give it to me in 
Portland. So I've been very proud of that.  I've got that nice placque from the Longshoremen.  But I 
worked real good with them. Annette Cleveland, which is our new senator down here, her dad was a 
very strong longshoreman.  Him and I were great friends together, and worked together on labor council 
stuff down here.  And Jim Forbes was absolutely, and he was one of 'em that was instrumental in 
helping get the Labor Roundtable started. Burkholder, that you met this morning, Tom was the chairman 
of it. And they asked me to do that, but you can only do so many, be involved in so many programs and 
that.   
 
And you can't do it all, so we had another fellow, and I don't know if you've had a chance to meet with 
Bill Slack or not.  Bill Slack is, was one of my reps. But Bill was, he's on the Board of the Smith Tower 
down here at the Round Tower.  I served on the board of the union retirement association for practically 
ever since it started, for all the union retirement homes in the Portland Vancouver area. But Bill was in 
charge of the marine stuff. He contacted all of the political people on this side of the river, heavily 
involved with elections of the various different state representatives, state senators, he campaigned on, 
was one of the main campaign people for Dean on his campaign. He put on most of the big salmon feeds 
Interview with Ed Barnes 
19 
 
for people down here.  He has all this stuff to cook all the full, big salmons and that.  They'd have it out 
at the Clackamas Lake Park, and big salmon feed.  
 
But electricians have always had to do their share.  And probably more so than some of the other ones. 
But everybody has their niche, and the electricians like to go , and we don't publicize.  Very little 
publicity to anybody about what we do. It's probably not a good, it probably wasn't a good idea. We 
probably should have blew our horn more often about what we did. And three of the main buildings 
downtown here are built with union pension funds. Big tall buildings.  And then all of the brick buildings 
around Vancouver Mall. That they built the first big bunch of 'em out there, all union pension funds.  
That's where I get my union pension check from, from the money that comes off of these buildings. 
We've invested a lot of money in WIlsonville out in Hillsboro, various different locations, in building the 
buildings.  Getting the electrical work from 'em. The trades get work, and so I promoted that really 
heavy.  That we do that. You can give it to the stock market, and the stock market lose your money right 
quick.  But they don’t lose that property and that building that the tenants are paying them payments 
every month to you. And so, I think we ought to be doing more of that. So.   
 
Anyway, I appreciate you getting in contact with me and hope everything goes well for you. 
 
DF:  Well, thank you.  It's been a real pleasure talking to you today. Let me put a tagline on:  Once again, 
Debbie Fant, talking with Ed Barnes at the Clark County Historical Museum on January 18, 2013.  Just 
after we attended the Labor Roundtable over at the County Buffet.  No, what was it?  The Homestyle 
Buffet?  (Country Buffet). It is the Country Buffet, over by the Mall.  (Fant sneezes)  That's a great way to 
end it!  Stand up and sneeze!  Okay, thank you, Ed!  
 
EB:  You're welcome.
