Yeah.  Nin-Ninety-six.  (F: uh-huh)  She died, [clears throat] she wanted all her 
children around her and, and she got her wish.  We had, we had three boys, three girls.  One, one 
of my brothers died with a heart attack.  We still got three girls living and two boys.  Me and my 
brother, (F: mm-hm) Joe, which is a very active bowler in Lowell.  One of the best in Lowell.  
(F: uh-huh)  He just turned sixty.  
F: Your brothers and sisters all still live in this area?

Street.  (F: mm-hm)
F:
Tell me, did your parents migra--come directly from the Madeira Islands to Lowell? 
B:
Yes.  No-oh--they came from the Madeira Islands.  They went to Brazil first, (F: oh!) 
and then from Brazil they came to Lowell. (F: mm-hm)
F:
And did they come to Lowell to work in the mills?  Did they do that?
B:
Uh, [clears throat] my father worked in the mills (F: mm-hm) and uh my mother run a 
boarding house.  She had, one time she had twenty-eight boarders in her house.  And she was 
very--          it was like ah if you had a sister and her brother was coming to Lowell, she would 
say "Go to Mrs. Barros' house."  She would not allow drinking, she would not allow woman 
in--the minute she found any of that stuff they-- (F: they went out)  [both talking at once] she 
threw them out.  They went out.  (F: mm-hm)  She had, threw a very, very respectable, ah, 
boarding home.  They used to call them [Portuguese word], houses, [same Portuguese word]  
You know that's uh when ah--like these people work in the Appleton Mills in Massachusetts; 
Boott Mills and all that.  They would live in her house.  (F: uh-huh)  And they would do [clears 
throat] their own cooking, and ah some she would cook.  You know they pay more, you know.  
(F: uh-huh) 
F:
So, um, did, did you eat with some of the boarders then?  When [both talking at once]
B:
Well, then [clears throat], then as we--she had six children, you know (F: uh-huh).  
Um, as, uh, sh-she got more children, she, she just, I think she stayed with just two cousins.  She 
just let them, you know.  As they, as they went back to the old country, or the--some went to 
California something like that, they, ah, she just didn't replace them, you know.  (F: I see)  She 
moved into a smaller home, you know.  (F: uh-huh)  She stayed just with two, ah, two cousins, 
you know.  That's--then when they went, went to the old country she never got anymore.  (F: 
mm-hm)
F:
Growing up in your house, did you speak Portuguese?
B:
My mother always made us speak Portuguese.  She didn't care if we spoke English 
outside, in the house she wanted us to speak Portuguese, and she didn't--she knew very, very, 
very little English, you know, and uh, my father died when I was, ah, I was going to be--see he 
died in March and in June I was going to be sixteen, you know.  (F: uh-huh)  So that's quite a few
years ago, and uh, and we stayed with my mother, and then my mother got city, city aid, you 
know.  We were just-- [clears throat] I used to work in the bakery when I was eleven, twelve 
years old, you know, delivering bread house to house.  We used to deliver bread before going to 
school.  [clears throat]  Excuse me.  And we used to deliver bread after school.  We used to 
deliver twice in the same house.  And, uh, we used to go basket, you know.
F:
Uh-huh.  And whose bakery was this?
B:
This, at this time it was my father's.  My father had a bakery, you know.  (F: uh-huh)  
He had a bakery, partnership with somebody.  He had the, and, ah, it was, ah, [clears throat] 
called Moonlight Baking Company and sometimes they used to call it Moonshine Bakery you 
know, [interviewer laughs] they used to make a thing.  And then when he, ah, he--the mills all 
started, Appleton Mill and Hamilton Mills and all that started to show we got the Depression 
there like you know, he had to close his bakery.  He had emerged with another bakery which was 
on the corner here.  It was, they used to call it Central Bakery, you know.  And then later, years 
after Central Bakery emerged with this one here now used to be Lusitania Bakery and I, when I, 
[clears throat] when I bought it I changed it to Barros Pastry Shop, which I originally opened on 
Gorham Street where Santoro's is, you know, on Gorham--
F:
          pizza and sub shop?
B:
Yeah. And I used--I had a little shop there and that's where I opened.  I think that was 
about thirty-five years ago, you know.  I'm not sure on the dates, you know. 
F:
Uh-huh.  What was the neighborhood like in those days?  Was it all Portuguese?
B:
Around here it used to be all, all Portuguese.  The minute you opened your, your shop 
it, you know, they'd come in.  You had to work all night, you know, to make bread and doughnuts
and so on so forth.  Well, at that time they didn't have uh doughnouts.  When I opened up I was 
more of an Americanized baker and I added cakes, birthday cakes, wedding cakes, and I added 
that to, with the help of my wife, you know. (F: mm-hm, mm-hm)  And uh, we, we started, we 
turned the bakery in--like an American bakery like, you know, with, still with the Portuguese 
bread.  We had the Portuguese bread, sweet bread, Portuguese sweet bread. And then we had the 
wedding cakes which sometimes I used to have twelve, fifteen wedding cakes every weekend, 
you know.  (F: yeah, right)  Every week.  (F: mm-hm)  But we use to sell them like fifteen, 
twenty, twenty-five dollars.  You didn't get noth--much money for that.  Because you used to 
work for three, three dollars, twelve dollars a week, you know.  (F: mm-hm)  So money wasn't 
that uh--there was no money, you know. (F: yeah) So--
F: And um, were most of the people who lived in the neighborhood then and who were 
Portuguese, Portuguese speaking?
B: Oh yes.  Most of--they used to be, uh, well I, when I bought the former Lusitania Bakery, uh, 
it used to be all along Central street up until uh, what did they used to call it, it used to be Katy 
Street, North Street, Katy Street, Ames Street, Mill Street, Rogers Street, Abbott Street, uh Cedar
Street, Floyd--up to far as that it used to be all Portuguese people on both sides.  They used to be 
sometimes mixed. And then coming down Central Street it would be Charles Street, Tyler 
Street--they would be Portuguese on both sides.  (F: mm-hm)  You know, all the way, that would 
be Charles Street over here, there would be Portuguese on, until they broke it down to make 
Zayre's and all that. And then over here on, going the other, opposite Charles, Charles Street 
going, going to uh, Gorham Street they used to be Chapel Street, and then there'd be Gorham 
Street, Summer Street, be all Portuguese on both sides. Like I said there'd be some English and 
some French but they would be ninety, ninety-five percent all Portuguese and it'd be all uh, five 
percent of different uh-- (F: mm-hm) and this would be an area [clears throat] oh--going all the 
way up to Gorham Street, then there'd be Madison Street there'd be, they broken them down to 
make highways, you know the connector.  (F: yeah, yeah)  See they broken, there would be all, 
all Portuguese people.  I remember that because I used to deliver bread with a basket before I 
went to school and then when I became of age, uh, I started to drive and I used to deliver--well 
even th--even before driving, with a horse and team.  I still got a little tail end of the horse and 
team, you know.  We used to go and we used to go on the outside of the, the City Hall in Lowell 
that would be all houses from the mill workers, you know.  They still got some there on the other
side.  But going, they used to be Moody Street. Moody Street.  There'd be Tilden Street, there'd 
be--I kind of forgot the names of the streets. They'd be all these houses where the people lived.  
The mill made those houses (F: uh-huh) so they could live-- [both talking at once]
F:
Were they still owned by the mills in those days?
B:
Yes, they were still mill, yeah.  (F: mm-hm) And uh, we used to deliver in what, it 
would be nothing to go on a Saturday afternnon with a wagon full--it was a wagon bought from 
Unida Biscuit Company, you know.  And my father bought that, had a lot of pride in it.  Nice 
yellow car--uh, nice yellow wagon with a horse, and uh we used to bring over seven hundred 
loaves of bread there, just in that area.  (F: o-oh)  In that area.  All the way from Worden Street, 
Kilton Street.  Oh, I can't think of all the names. All the way down up as far as uh, Textile Street 
or Textile--you know, something like that, up around, just a little bit before Textile School, you 
know.  (F: mm-hm)  And you go in that area.  On one side it would be all Portuguese, and one 
side it would be French, you know, (F: uh-huh) the French people, (F: uh-huh) you know. And 
uh, they, it would be nothing because there were a lot of boarding houses. You would bring 
twenty, thirty breads into a, into a house. (F: uh-huh)  You had a big, big basket you know.  (F: 
uh-huh)  And you would bring twenty, thirty breads into the, into the, into (F: uh-huh) the house. 
I remember that as if that was today.
F: 
And that would, it would be the, the loaves like French bread or wheat bread?
B:
Yeah.  Well in them days they used to make more of the round bread.  The round 
Portuguese bread they used to call it, the round Portuguese bread, you know.  (F: uh-huh)  And 
uh, there would, people would bring, people would get a, uh--then we started to make the long 
loaves, then the long loaves they used to cut that in three, in three things and put--some of them 
used bring grapes, put grapes, bananas inside and they eat the br--eat the grapes inside the 
banana.  And then when they hit the Depression people didn't have much money.  They used to 
buy bread and they, they used to put molasses on the bread, sugar on the bread.  They even went 
as far as putting compound uh, short--uh compound lard. In them days they used to call it 
compoound lard.  It was a refined uh, lard, not the pure lard, you know.  It would be the--they 
refined it.  Almost like make--like they make Crisco today, (F: uh-huh, uh-huh) you know.  They 
would refine the lard, you know.  (F: mm-hm)  And the lard would be, that was before Crisco and
all them (F: yeah) probably come out on the market, see.  I remember that because I used to, you 
know and our bread had a lot of holes in it, you know, that's, and the people would say I like that 
bread because where there's no holes you can't put butter, you know.  (F: yeah, yeah)  They didn't
have no money. They didn't have no money.  (F: uh-huh)  We had people that, that we used to 
mark in the books, you know.  Like my father died, he had books that people owed him three, 
four hundred dollars in bread.  And when the Depression came that they really just, there was 
nothing they--he didn't have no more--he didn't, he lost all that money.  My father died, people 
owed him money.  The ones that owed him money, they didn't pay.  The ones he owed (F: yeah) 
money they came, they came (F: yeah, yeah sure) and find--that's, (F: yeah, uh-huh) that's the 
way life is, you know.  (F: mm-hm)  
F:
Uhm, back when you were young must have been when a lot of the fruit trees and 
grapes arbors were planted around here?
B:
Well, all along these, the fruit trees people would have a lot of grape vines, you know, 
in their yards, you know.  (F: uh-huh)  And people would plant, plant a lot, you know, they would
plant a lot.  Which they are now doing.  These people, the new generation, that came from all the
old countries now, in their back yards there--they have grapevines, they have everything.  (F: 
mm-hm)  But [clears throat] they would uh, they would have pears and things like that.  Even 
when I lived years ago I bought a house on back Central Street here with my father-in-law and 
uh, we had a great, great pear tree; big pears like that (F: wow) they used to, we used to make 
jams and things like that, you know.  (F: mm-hm)  We had all the--my mother-in-law and my 
wife they would all get together and they would make the jams and things like that.  People, 
people really did have a lot of, lot of fruit trees in them days, you know what I mean?  (F: 
uh-huh)  Because uh, there was no television.  People would like to amuse themselves with 
something  so they, they all had a garden you know.  (F: uh-huh)  
F:
Can you tell me, uhm, your son said he saw just a glimpse as a child of things like 
Christmas customs.  Can you tell me about Christmas when you were young?
B:
Well, everybody, everybody would have a Christmas thing, And everybody you used 
to go, we used to go house to house and sing. (F: mm-hm)  We would have a group, you know, 
and some would play a violin and guitar, and we'd all, we'd all sing, you know.  And uh, I knew a
f-few they used to sing [sings in Portuguese]  You know, like uh, the owner of the house will you
please open the door because we want to give you our Christmas thing.  And we would all go in 
the house.  They would open the door and they'd have something, something there to give you, 
you know, to give you something.  And a lot of people used to make uh, a manger.  (F: a manger, 
yeah)  You should see the mangers that they used to make.  They used to make a manger that 
would take that whole room there like that, you know.  I said, ten by twelve or           by fifteen 
and they'd make the whole            They'd make uh things           making people making 
moonshine with the real stills.  And all that.  All, all the things.  (F: uh-huh)  They would uh--
F:
People in the family would make the figures?
B:
They'd all make the, the figures, they'd make everything.  They'd, and they'd hang uh, 
fruits and oranges and things like that and then they'd make uh wheat.  They'd put wheat in little 
uh, little jars, you know.  Little, little--
F:
O-oh.  Would they sprout it?
B:
And they would sprout.  (F: ahh)  My wife, my wife still does that.
F:
She still does that?
B:
Yeah, she still does that. 
F:
She still makes a manger?
B:
Uh, she still makes a little manger.  But I mean she, she took up ceramics and she 
made the whole thing. Now she's had that about eighteen years and she still, she puts it all up, 
you know.
F:
Is she going to put it up this Christmas?
B:
She's going to put it up this Christmas.
F:
Would it be possible for me to come and photograph it?
B:
Sure, sure, sure.  I mean it's not a, a big thing, (F: yeah) but it's what she made, you 
know.  She usually makes it all uh, she's got all, all the things, and she's got, she winds it and it 
plays uh, (F: uh-huh) "Silent Night" I think.  I think it plays "Silent Night."
F:
 A music box?
B:
A music box, (F: yeah) but it uh--she made it and she's got the angels, she's got 
the--everything--the little, the little uh--  And her father went to the old country and he brought 
little Jesus but, he's, he's a big statue, you know. They, they, they said "Gee, what did you, what 
did you buy one so big like that?"  But, the man is passed away and they always kept it for, (F: 
right) she always kept it for a, for a thing of uh--  (F: sure)  Re--it reminds her of her father, it 
reminds her of her father and what her father used to do, you know.  But uh, every place would 
have--not every place, but almost every house would have a manger.  (F: mm-hm)  Almost.  
They, that, this is going like uh, my mother and if, see?  That's my generation, my grandfather 
didn't come, it was my mother that came from the old country, you know.  (F: mm-hm, mm-hm)  
From the Madeira Islands.  And they used to, they all, it was a different uh, like they used to be a 
Portuguese band hall, it's still a Portuguese band hall, but more          of a club now.  We used to 
have uh, uh, dances, the old folks dancing, you know.  (F: uh-huh)  And they'd play the guitars 
and they'd, and it, it's almost like these dances that they call out, um, (F: square dancing) square 
dancing.  Almost a square dancing.  They say [speaks in Portuguese]  It means one pair in the 
front, one pair in the back, and, you know, and you didn't say, "I danced", you know.  Different, 
different--I, I kind of recall that because I was, I was young (F: uh-huh) and I was kind of 
courting my wife, you know, and my wife used to go to those places like that. There would be 
another girl I was kind of sweet on.  She, you know, we used to, you know, dance.  That's, that 
was our uh, hangout like, you know.  (F: mm-hm)  And we looked forward to, for them to, they 
used to call it [speaks Portuguese] you know.  And they used to call it like a Portuguese um, ball 
(F: ball, mm-hm) Portuguese uh-- (F: mm-hm)  
F:

Connecticut, too.  We have some, they used to have something called a [speaks Portuguese word]
Does that--

people call ano-ano- another, see.  (F: yeah)  They used to call [speaks Portuguese words], you 
know and they call, and like when we come, where my folks come from, the Madeira Islands, 
they call it [speaks Portuguese words]  And even my son was in it.  Uh, they used to dance, you

And he used to, he was very good in that.  And he used to make them, make uh, [speaks

friend, not a--he was from the family on, on--my father-in-law's cousin.  They were making--in 
the Lowell silk mill they were making fifteen, twenty dollars a week.  He went out to New Jersey
and as a weaver he was already making--this is going way back--making fifty dollars a week.  He
told, he called, he called or he wrote to a lot of people here and saying that--how much money he
was making.  "Look you guys are not making."  They didn't believe it.  They thought he was 
lying.  That he was making fifty or sixty dollars a week, (F: mm-hm, mm-hm) you know.  Out 
there in, in New Jersey.  Ah, Clifton, New Jersey.  He was uh--and he bought a piece of land out

mother-in-law took I don't know how many mon-month or two to get over here from--She had a 
lot of storms and everything like that.  To come from Port--Madeira Islands, to come to 
Boston--Boston, New York, I forget where--and she was afraid to travel again, back.  They were 
afraid to make those moves, you know.  (F: mm-hm)  Because they were--took so long.  (F:

younger, see.  And I used to deliver bread and a lot of those people would talk to me you know.  
And they, oh they'd say "Oh, I knew your cousin in Portugal or in Madeira, (F: mm-hm, mm-hm)
you know or something like that and we would talk.  (F: ah-huh)  I recall a lot of, a lot of nice 
people, you know.  And I, ah also recall even ah this Brazilian, Brazilian.  He was a--I forget 
what he was--a mason or something like that and uh he was a good, good worker; a very, very 
religious man.  And he, he was, he says "I'm fortunate to make--come to America and make good
money.  And he--at the collection in the box he was the only one who would put a dollar, or five 
or--  All the others would put pennies and things (F: mm-hm) like that.  He says "I'm fortunate." 
And he would, he would put that kind of money.  And the priest the next Sunday would say "I 
want to thank so-and-so for the generous (F: mm-hm) offering that he gave us, you know.  (F: 
mm-hm)  People ah, you know.
 
F:
Do yo belong to any Portuguese-American clubs?
B:
Ah--I don't belong to any Portugue--I used to [clears throat]  I used to pay all the dues 
but I never, I never go to them, you know.  (F: mm-hm)  The only one I, I belong to is the Holy 
Ghost Sodality.  (F: uh-huh)  The socie--what would that be--society, Holy Ghost Society.  Holy 
Ghost Society.  In fact I'm a, a life member.  I know I have it, but I--  [looks through papers]  I'm 
a life member.  Yeah.  Holy Ghost Society.  Life member.  (F: oh, yeah, uh-huh)  Yeah.  I 
belonged to it so many years that uh they gave me a--I think when you reach seventy (F: 
mm-hm) or something like that you--  Thank God I reached seventy!  (F: yes)  [Mr. Barros 
chuckles]  So they--that's the only one.  And I belong to the           Elks.  I belong to the           
Elks.  And I had a friend, he belonged to it and he says "Why don't you belong to it so we can 
go;" they have parties every month (F: uh-huh) or something like that, (F: uh-huh) you know.  
And I used to go with my wife and him.  (F: mm-hm)  
F:
You--your son said you used to supply bread for the feast of the Holy Ghost.
B:
Yes.  We supplied feast for the Holy Ghost far as I can remember.  Even--I used to 
work before I bought--before I opened my bakery, I used to work in this bakery.  They used to 
call it the Lusitania Bakery.  And we used to make ah--we used to make all the bread and all the 
sweet bread for them.  And they, they would make a decorated sweet bread.  They used to call it 
[vuschilish, vuschilish?]  All decorated--on that decorating--that was my idea of decorating it, 
you know.  Because they used give it plain, you know.  (F: mm-hm)  Plain and I used to frost it 
and make roses on it and, and put on it "From Lusitania Bakery" and then when I, when I bought 
the bakery--no, when I had my bakery over there-- they used to give me some, some of the 
business.  They used to split it up.  (F: uh-huh)  And then I would ah, like ah--I would put it 
"From the Barroses."  I'd write on it "From the Barros."  Then I had a, a--a granddaughter, you 
know, and she was--she's--she's partially deaf and I always, I used to make one put it in--her 
name on it, you know, Justina Barros, you know.  And uh--and then one from the bakery, you 
know.  And then uh as the family increased--and then when I bought this baker shop and as the 
family increased I used to put one--I have a son, Barry; grandson, Barry.  I used to put "From Mr.
and Mrs. Barros, jr."  And then from Mr. Barr--uh Mr.--I used to give four of them.  (F: uh-huh) 
You know four, four of those--
F:
One for your son and one for each of the grandchildren?
B:
Yeah.  (F: yeah?)  And, see and one from the bakery, see.  (F: yeah)  And then that 
would--they would raffle them off.  And if they had two hundred dollars a bread, that would pay 
their bread.  Understand?  (F: uh-huh)  Because they--they'd auction them or raff--auction them 
off  (F: right)  Like auction them.  They'd get the highest bidder gets them.  Sometimes they's get 
twenty-five dollars.  [phone rings]  Because that's supposed to be like a, a blessed thing, you 
know.  (F: mm-hm)  And people would--I'm going to buy that in honor of my son or whatnot, or 
my (F: mm-hm) father or something like that.  (F: mm-hm)  And then people would 
make--people also would donate to the Holy Ghost feast--they called the Holy Ghost Feast--they 
would also donate if they, if they had a sore leg, we'd make a shape of a leg so they could be--get
better in the leg, you know.  (F: oh, really!)  Yeah.  And those people would pay for it--pay us to 
making it, right.  And they'd go off and buy it themselves after.  Even if--even if they had a 
bidder.  If somebody else had a sore leg, (F: uh-huh) and they were bidding, and they were 
bidding, and were bidding.  And sometimes they'd, they'd have to pay through the nose but they'd
still buy it.  They'd buy it because that's--they, they, they'd, they wanted it, (F: mm-hm, mm-hm) 
you know what I mean.  
F: 
Do you still go to the feast?
B:
There, there's my wife.  Excuse me.  (F: o-oh!)  Rose, this is the lady that's 
interviewing me, that.
F:
Uhm, let me ask you about other holidays that were celebrated among the Portuguese 
here in back central Lowell.
B:
Well, they--they have--they have the Holy Ghost feast, they have St. Anthony's feast.  
(F: mm-hm)  [sighs]  And the, the--years ago they used to have two Holy Ghosts ah--they 
celebrated two Holy Ghosts.  (F: really?)  Yeah.  But I can't, I can't, I can't recall the names right 
now.  
F:
Well, if you can't recall their names, can you recall whether there was anything 
different about them?
B:
No.  It, it's, it's the same thing.  See, they, they would, they would have the Holy Ghost
ah, celebrated in your house.  They pick out names.  (F: yeah)  And you'd have the Holy Ghost 
this week, right?  (F: mm-hm)  And then the other one would have the Holy Ghost--the other one
next week, see what I mean?  (F: yes)  And then when the Holy Ghost feast is on, the both of 
them would march with the--in the procession.  They would make a procession from the Holy 
Ghost--from the St. Anthony's Church (F: mm-hm) or from their house.  From their house to St. 
Anthony's Church, see?  (F: mm-hm, mm-hm)  Or else if it was too far, they would just go to the 
church and then they'd have a, a, a procession around the church.  (F: mm-hm)  They come 
ar--stop at the church again, see?  (F: mm-hm)  But if they lived--sometimes they lived--years 
ago if they lived near the church they would make the procession, see?  But then it got, got to be 
blocking off so many streets that they uh they just made the procession like from, from the 
church.  You'd bring the, the, the Holy Ghost thing to the church and when they'd come out 
they'd march from the church (F: uh-huh) down Central Street, up [Elum] Street, down Vernon 
Street and come down, you know. (F: mm-hm)  Like that, see.
F:
When people had the Holy Ghost--I take it you mean the crown and the-- (B: the 
crown, that's it, yeah) in their homes, uhm, did you go to their homes to see it?  Did they--
B:
Yeah.  They would ah--you'd, you'd ah, you'd, you'd pray, you know.  You'd pray and 
there (F: mm-hm) was a certain time you'd pray.  And 
you ah--well people believed in that, you know.  See.  A lot.  And they still do it, they still do it 
yet.  They still do it, they still do that.  But then they have uh, uh--
F:
Did they have a banner in front of their house?
B:
The band.  They have a band, yeah.
F:
No, a ban--a banner.  Do they have--did they, they used to have a banner, out in front 
of the house?
B:
Ah--geez, that I don't know.  (F: you don't know)  Rose!  Rose! Rosie!  [yells]  When 
they had the Holy Ghost in the house, do they have a banner outside letting them know they 
have--  (Rose: no)  No.  No.  
F:
Okay.  How about other [loud background noise] customs that are Portuguese that you 
might have had in your home?  Were there other things your parents did?
B:
Well, they have--they, they, they have a thing when it comes Christmastime.  (F: yeah)
Christmastime.  They, they uh make um--they cut a pork.  They uh marinate pork.  (F: uh-huh)  
They call it [speaks Portuguese word]  They call it [speaks word again] you know.  And it's like a
tradition.  And everybody has a piece of that you know.  Like my wi--my wife still does it.  Her 
mother used to do it, my mother used to do it.  And we'd, we'd all go like we'd go her mother's 
house and then we'd end up by going up to my mother's house, you know.  
F:
That's marinated in what? 
B:
Ah, marinated in uh--  Rose!  What's the [speaks same Portuguese word] marinated in?
What--  (Rose: Oh, vinegar and water and garlic and pepper and bay leaves.  It's a marinade and 
then you pour it over the pork.)  
F:
Uh-huh.  Vinegar, garlic, bay leaves, what else?  (Rose: Allspice.)
Allspice.  (Rose: You know, the little balls.)  Yeah.  Right.  (Rose: Yeah, the pickling spice.)  
Okay.  Pickling spices.  (Rose: You know, a little thing in--  (F: uh-huh, uh-huh)  And salt and 
pepper.)  And salt and pepper.  And then do you roast it after you marinate it?  (Rose: Oh I fry it, 
you know.  I fry it and I put bread on top.  And it--you know it goes into the bread and it gives it 
a nice flavor.) (F: Oh, terrific!)  (Rose: Some people don't like it.  Like her, she doesn't like it.  
But my son loves it.)  [all laugh and talk]
B:
They--And they fight--  [Rose talking in background]
F:
Is this your daughter-in-law?  (Rose: Yeah)  Oh!  
B:
That's Manny's wife.
F: 
Oh!  Nice to meet you.  I interviewed your husband yesterday. (Mrs. Barros: 
Who--Who is this for, may I ask who--)  This is for the Lowell Folklife Project.  Let me see if I 
can find you--
B:
I had it on the table there.  (Mrs. Barros: Oh, I have a card, yeah.  I have it at home.)
F:
That's who it's for.  Yeah.  
B:
(Rose: I got to go babysit my brother.)  Yeah, okay.  (Rose: All right?)  I'll see you in a 
little while, okay?  (Rose: All right?  [both talk at once]  Are you going to be here long?)  No, 
after I finish with the interview.  I got to chop some wood, though.  Bring that wood in.  Okay?  
(Rose: Yeah.)
F:
(Rose: It was nice talking to you.)  It was nice to talk to you.  (Rose: When you want 
to see the manger you're welcome.)  Thank you.  (Rose: If you can find your way up there.)  I'll 
be able to find my way.  (Rose: Yeah.  (F: yeah)  It's not hard.  Really.)  Okay.  (Rose: Don't 
forget that phone call, Sue.)  (Sue: No.)  Um, are there other foods that you remember?  
B:
Well, on that marinated (F: yeah, okay) thing.  She, she, she makes it, you know.  (F: 
uh-huh)  [lowers voice] I have to make something to           to, you know.  
F:
Oh-- (someone yells in background: You can keep that in the fridge for two weeks--)  
Okay.  (--if you don't use it all at once)  
B:
And, uh--well, it happens that my friends work at the policemen.  (F: uh-huh)  
Lieutenant P--he's married to a Portuguese.  (F: oh)  And--and ah, he's always willing to do me a 
favor.  Anything.  (uh-huh)  Not--I, I--not tickets (F: I understand) or anything like that.  I, I--if I 
do (F: yeah) something wrong I want to--  But ah, he, he loves that and so we have to bring some
to him.  (F: yeah)  Yeah.  (F: uh-huh)  So--but, you can with that custom that she has, Christmas 
custom, she cuts up oranges and you squeeze the orange on top of the juice, the orange juice on 
top of the meat and--  (F: oh! oh!)  It's out of this world! (F: Yeah.  It sounds it!)  Yeah.  I mean I 
love it.  Some people don't like--you know, just like lemons.  They squeeze lemon in a lot of 
food.  (F: uh-huh)  Fish and things like that.  A lot of people don't like it.  But I like it.  I do, you 
know.  (F: yeah)  And uh--That's the only custom I, I can think of right now.  Ah--oh, Easter.  
They usually make the Easter bread.  They celebrate with the Easter bread, with eggs.  You 
know, we make big, big pieces of dough and we put eggs in it, you know (F: uh-huh)  And we 
bake it off.  You know.  (F: uh-huh)  Now, the younger generation--at a certain time they get 
away from it.  But as they get older they remember what their folks used to do and they'll come 
and they'll buy.  But when they're young, you know.  But when they get matured a little bit 
longer-- (F: uh-huh)  they have children and everything like that, they'll re--"Oh, my father and 
my mother used to do this, do that", you know.  And they'll--they'll order bread with eggs.  (F: 
uh-huh)
F:
Is, (B: Some--) is it a sweet bread?
B:
It's a Portuguese sweet bread--
F:
It's [matsasavata].
B:
[Matsavata].  (F: yeah)  Are you--you're not Portuguese are you?
F:
No, my next door neighbors are.
B:
Oh, are they?
F:
They keep at me and keep at me.  (B: yeah, yeah)  They're going to--
B:
[Matsasavata, matsasavata].  (F: yeah, mm-hm)  I, I, I, I had--you know, you can't 
think of everything.  The [matsasavata].  (F: yeah)  And they--that's the tradition.  We used to 
start making that Easter, Easter Sunday, right.  We used to start delivering it on a Wednesday, we 
had so much.  (F: oh)  When I was a kid, when I was young.  (F: uh-huh)  There was so much.  
And there--like I said there was a lot of Portuguese people here.  (F: mm-hm)  And they were 
still at that--like sixty, seventy, you know what I mean.  And they still had that old thing from the
old country because they never made enough money to go back to the old country.  They all died.
Now, things are better that they come over here in six months and they go back and visit their 
folks.
F: 
Uh-huh.  They've made enough money in six months? 
B:
They make--well, (F: yeah) you know, ten dollars a week and twelve dollars a week.  
They'd have to save money for twenty years (F: mm-hm) to go back and see--  Now, some of 
them work around the clock.  They're making five, six hundred dollars a week.  That's him and 
his wife, you know.  (F: mm-hm)  They work their sixteen hours.  Not everybody.  But there's 
some that will do that.  And they--like I told you, we used to make so much and we used to have 
a bread mixer, a bread mixer and we used to--aach!  Mix it for two, three days.  (F: mm-hm)  
And I started delivering it on a Wednesday.  That's how much [matsasavata] we used to make 
here.  In this baker shop here.  Because this baker shop, like I said it was the Lusitania Bakery, 
(F: mm-hm) and as times--as the people were--you know the mills were closing.  They emerged 
with this one, you know.  (F: uh-huh)  Oh, they sold out to this one.  You know.  (F: uh-huh)  
This was the strongest one.  And they had it all.  And I was deli--I was working here.  I started 
working in the counter, you know.  (F: mm-hm)  And then when the bread baker--cake 
baker--you know, kind of left, you know, the one that they were making just very, very few--all 
they did was cupcakes, (F: mm-hm) cupcakes, that's all.  And I was already--knew a little bit 
more, see.  And ah, we started to make more and more and more and deliver, deliver--like I said 
deliver on a, on a Wednesday, start delivering it.
F:
When did you in this bakery stop delivering?  You don't deliver anymore, do you?
B:
We don't deliver.  We--well, ah I see.  [pause: 10 sec.]  Maybe a good fifteen years.  
Well, it seems like--I had a baker (F: uh-huh) and a truck driver.  And I was the, the other baker, 
you know.  Well, it seemed like the baker and the truck driver were in cahoots.  The baker, the 
baker got sick, the truck driver was sick.  Then I'd have to work inside and go out and deliver.  
(F: uh-huh)  You know?  I, I cou--at that--I couldn't go right off and--in and get--  (F: mm-hm)  
And then I used to have--I'd have to take my son sometimes out of school.  And the school--they,
they didn't have, you know, them days they didn't have no--you had to go to school and that's all. 
I says, "Well I need him.  My baker got sick and this--"  "That's not our problem."  (F: mmm)  
And the truant officer would be more strict.  (F: mm-hm)  If they were strict th--now as they 
were then (F: yeah) they probably wouldn't be so much trouble (F: yeah) as they are-- (F: 
uh-huh) it, it is now.  But I--they ah--it's always the meek.  I was kind of meek, you know.  And I 
was just trying to earn a good living and be, (F: mm-hm) be straight.  They used to fall on 
me--says "You take--we'll have you arrested."  So I says one day I just made up my mind.  I 
said--the baker got sick, the truck driver got sick.  I went out and delivered.  I says we're just 
finishing Saturday when there's no more deliveries.  That day believe it or not I was--ooh it 
happened front of the church, St. Jean d'Arc Church up on Merrimack Street, you know.  (F: 
uh-huh)  I just--from working--I overworked and I just took a fainting spell.  (F: oh boy!)  I 
thought this is it.  I couldn't move, and there was no way of me getting out of the truck, and the 
snow was that high.  I had to bake.  I had to deliver.  I said "I can't do it."  So that day I went and 
I, and I stopped it.  (F: mm-hm)  I couldn't--I was going to kill myself, you know.  (F: mm-hm)  
Because I was trying to make it two jobs and people then (F: yeah) they didn't care.  (F: yeah)  
You know, so, so I didn't--that's the time I decided to--  And you can't--it, it, it's a passe thing.  
You cannot pay a man--even if you pay a man three dollars, three dollars, see.  He goes--climbs 
the stairs goes up there to the bread and says "Well, um can you get me a half of dozen of 
doughnuts?"  The man comes out and gets a half a dozen doughnuts.  "I don't want no bread 
today.  Half a dozen doughnuts."  He's wasted a half an hour-- (F: uh-huh) see I'm, I'm, I'm 
quoting three dollars an hour.  (F: uh-huh) It costs him a dollar and a half--it costs me a dollar 
and a half to--for half a dozen of doughnuts.  (F: yeah)  Plus the car, the, the truck.  (F: uh-huh)  
Right?  (F: yeah)  It didn't pay.  It couldn't pay.  (F: yeah)  And then if, if you happen to get--go 
into a customer's house and the customer wanted "Well, how's your father, how's your mother, 
how's your sister, how's your aunt?"  [interviewer chuckles]  (F: mm-hm)  It's costing me--then 
they say "Well, I don't want anything today."  (F: mm-hm)  You know?  (F: uh-huh)  And the 
man--he'd be out in the truck and say "Geez."  You'd come back and he's late and somebody says 
"My husband's going to work.  You haven't got no bread for him."  And he's, he's gabbed (F: 
mm=hm) in some houses for half an hour.  (F: mm-hm) It went out the window.
F:
So this is already past the time when there's--when you can sell seven hundred loaves 
of bread-- [both talking]
B:
Oh, this is way, way back.  [unclear]  This is ah--that's when the Depression--the mills 
started (F: uh-huh) to close and every thing like that. (F: uh-huh)  There was no, no way.  You, 
you can't, you can't do it today.  Even--after that they even had American bakers had the way of 
going--delivering house to house, house-- (F: mm-hm)  They just had to stop that.  (F: mm-hm)  
They--they couldn't afford it.  (F: mm-hm)  You know.  Even if you--even if it was your own 
bakery and you, you were working and delivering--if you work for somebody else, you're going 
to get paid, so why sh--why shouldn't you get paid?  (F: mm-hm)  You're going to deliver--but 
you tr--y-you know, you're just killing yourself trying to, trying to make money.  And y-you can't
do it.  You just (F: yeah) can't do it, you know.  When I opened my bakery I had a lady tell me--I 
said--ah-h she asked me "What are you going to do?"  I says "Well, I'm going to pay my bills and
this and that."  "No."  She says "No".  I says "Why?"  She says "If you were working someplace 
else, at the end of the week what do you get?  You get a week's pay.  Right?"  She said "You--" I 
never forgot that.  A nice lady.  She said "You at the end of the week, you take your week's pay 
out and then you pay your bills.  If you have no money to pay your bills, then get out of 
business."  Because a lot of people did the sa--oh, for two years I'm going to put the mon--in 
business and this (F: yeah, yeah) and that--I'm not going to take any--for two years they put 
themselves way behind their, their, their house, the (F: mm-hm) payments on their house and this
and that and they never catch up.  (F: mm-hm)  He says that's what you got to--you got to eat, 
you got to sleep, you got to heat and you got to--  You take your week's pay out first and then 
you man--  If you don't do it in four months or two months you're losing money.  Folds up.  And 
I--that, that's what I did.  I started my, my first week I got a week's pay and God was good to me. 
And I-- (F: and you worked hard)  I worked hard for it.  But--and--you know, nobody gave it to 
me.  It's just--when you go into business--at that time when you went into business it was just 
like having a steady job.  (F: mm-hm)  Buying a job.  You bought a business, you bought a job.  
You knew you were going to get a week's pay.  (F: mm-hm)  See.  Today, people don't have to 
do.  They get--they go into a mill they have all dental, all the benefits.  They get this, they get 
that.  We didn't have that.  If we didn't save, we wouldn't have it.  Is that right?  (F: yeah, yeah)  
It's true.  Today, people have a lot of, a lot of benefits.  Your father and mother probably never 
had that.  I don't know-- [both talking]
F:
My father was in his own business, yeah.  That's (B: see?) true.  And, and he had to 
start it.  He started it just at the end of the Depression.  It was a struggles for him.  (B: so, see)  
Yeah.  
B:
What kind of business your father in?
F:
Ah, it was lubricating oils and greases.  (B: oh-h, well)  Yeah.  So that in a sense he 
was a, he was a middle man.  All of his customers were commercial.
B:
Oh yeah.  Well, see now your father probably was in a--he was in a better business 
because machinery and everything like that (F: yeah, yeah) was coming up.  They had to use 
that.  Well, like people say "Well, in the bakery they all got to eat".  But you have--there's no 
more--there's not a business there's more competition than a baker.  (F: mm-hm)  You go into 
every supermarket, (F: mm-hm) they got a bakery now.  (F: mm-hm)  And they get ah--they have
people that just, they just make stuff to put in the supermarket.  They don't go--they don't want ah
some bakers that have ideas.  They just make cookies and things like that and put in the bakery 
shop.  And now they're putting in, in ah department stores.  (F: mm-hm.  That's, that's right.)  
They're putting into department stores.  So just around here, just around here there was this baker
shop here, this baker shop here.  There was one on the corner.  There was one in the back.  
Right?  (F: mm-hm)  There was one across the street.  (F: wow)  There was one right on Charles 
Street, right?  (F: uh-huh)  There was two on Gorham Street right there.  And there was one in 
back of Sau--there used to be a Saunders Market.  There was one in back of Saunders Market.  
And then there was two ah right down, down the street here.  Now you figure right around here 
there was ten bakeries.  Ten.  
F:
And they--and for a while they all flourished together?
B:
They all flourished together.  (F: uh-huh)  And then I, I was lucky I, I'm the one that 
survived here.  
F:
Uh-huh.  And, and were there other kinds of small markets, too?  
B:
There used to be the A&P markets, they used to call it, Atlantic and--  (F: uh-huh, but 
it was smaller then?)  Th--smaller, oh yeah, smaller.  Then they--as they--they got larger ones and
all that but they--these like Demoulas started to open up.  Alexander's started to open up.  (F: 
yeah)  You know they, they, they, they were too big.  (F: mm-hm)  And they were--got the--see in
them days they started to put out a lot of stuff cheaper than the small guy.  Right?  (F: uh-huh)  
But now they're, they're--some of them are more expensive than the, the--than if there was a 
small--and they're buying it cheaper, right?  And they're making more money on it, right?  (F: 
right)  Because they're going and buying it by the carloads.  So it's-- [chuckles]
F:
Well, were there, were there more bakeries than there were things like meat markets 
and fish markets?  (B: well--)  Because everybody needed bread?
B:
Well there just, just over here, too.  Now going over here, there was a--two 
market--one, two--  There was three markets right down the street here.  (F: uh-huh)  Back 
Central Street.  There was a market right across the street.  There was a house there.  There was a
market right across the street.  (F: uh-huh)  It's the one before there's a fish market, but there's 
one where that lot is.  (F: yeah)  That used to be a market there.  There used to be a market over 
there.  And there used to be a little market right on this side here.  (F: uh-huh)  That's what I 
recall.  
F:
Did people have markets in their homes, too?  Like living in back of or up over the 
market?
B:
Ah, they, that's--there used to be some.  Because like this, this  here is a house 
converted into a bakery.  (F: oh, uh-huh)  See, this used to be a, a house, and they converted it 
into a bakery.  Now I, I cut that back there.  See the--that's like an alley and I made it so I could 
make the bakery a little bigger (F: uh-huh) because it's too narrow.  (F: uh-huh)  And ah, there 
was some places that had--but I, I can't just recall right now.  I think there was two, two markets 
right here, here.  There was two markets right here on Charles Street.  Was a house.  (F: uh-huh)  
Yeah.  Two, two, two of them right here.  Yeah, I recall that.  S-see now, like us, we have a, a, a 
reely--a reel oven, right?  (F: yeah!)  Uh, reel means arou--  (F: be r-e-e-l, yeah, yeah, uh-huh)  
Yeah. Yeah.  And uh, now years ago we had ah a peel oven (F: oh!  where you reach in--)  One of
the--hearth oven, hearth oven, yeah. (F: uh-huh)  Now, the hearth oven used to come as far as 
this post here.  See?  (F: uh-huh. About ten feet further.  Maybe)  Yeah.  (F: yeah)  And we had 
that peel.  Now that peel used to go as far as the sink here.  (F: oh!)  Nobody could--you couldn't 
work here.  A lot of times I, I, I used to poke my, my wife and try to beat [interviewer laughs] me
in order to going.   She's coming down to get some bread and I used to poke her, I--o-oh  (F: 
o-oh)  See, I, I feel, I used to feel sorry, you know.  And uh, used to be by coke.  Then we 
converted it to oil.  See.  I had pictures--
F:
Is it oil now?
B:
Uh, it's gas.
F:
It's gas now.
B:
Gas now.  And when my son come in with me, you know.  He was working for me you
know.  He says "Pa, why don't get rid of that".  My hands--from the peel I couldn't open my 
hands.  My hands were like that.  (F: o-oh!)  You know the peel, you know.  (F: yeah)  They were
burned, calluses, you know.  (F: o-oh!)  [laughs]  They were like that.  Even, even today they, 
they, they c--I have a hard time straightening them out.  They always go like--have a tendency to 
[interviewer laughs] come like that.  And uh, we used to--but we used to make from, from Friday
nights seven until two, three Saturday morning, we used to sell anywhere from eight hundred 
loaves of bread to a thousand loaves of bread on a Saturday.  (F: oh boy!)  Over the counter.  (F: 
oh boy!)  See when we used to deliver it, we used to deliver it better.  We didn't have no businees
over here.  (F: uh-huh)  The minute I stopped delivering, we started to have business.  (F:uh-huh)
But things were changing a little bit, too, you know.  People were--one here, one there were 
buying a car, you know.  Like now, well now today everybody--if you got four in the family 
four--there's four cars outside, you know.  (F: yeah)  But in them days uh--and then people would
walk.  I remember, I remember when I used to work--I used t--like I said I used to work with 
these guys, they were Lusitania.  It used to be like a parade going down the street.  People with 
their, with their lunch box, lunch thing like that.  (F: mm-hm)  They'd come in and buy a loaf of 
bread and cut (F: mm-hm) it in half and put-- (F: mm-hm) thing like I said a little while ago.  (F: 
mm-hm)  And coming back at five o'clock it's be--well, no matter where's the store people were 
walking.  You know, they were going into the stores.  (F: mm-hm)  But today, people get in--they
go to work in the car to come back in the car t-, t-, t--  (F: yeah)   You, you don't have that.  (F: 
yeah)  But used to be--
F:
You must have seen every body in the neighborhood then, practically every day.
B:
Oh!  I used to see a lot of them, I used to deliver a lot of them.  I was married about a 
hundred times.  Every time-- [both laugh] these people'd say "I want you to marry my daughter, I
want you to marry my daughter, I want you to marry my daughter."  Because I went into, into 
their houses when I was a young kid, you know.  (F: mm-hm)  Young, young boy.  So they, they 
used to know me, you know.  (F: mm-hm)  I, when I opened my baker shop, I didn't even 
advertise.  They just said--they just knew that I was going to open a bakery and they came to me.
(F: mm-hm)  The-uh, this is the gods' truth, you know.  And uh, [people laughing and making 
lots of noise in background] we didn't have no, we didn't, we didn't have no trouble.  Not trouble 
at all.  Because I used to deliver bread with--started with my father, going (F: mm-hm) house to 
house.  My father had a baker shop of his own.  H-h-he, like he was the same way, h-he was 
president of societies.  He formed a society because people couldn't be buried.  They didn't have 
no money to be buried.  So they, they formed a society, a dollar a month.  (F: uh-huh)  You 
know?  (F: uh-huh, uh-huh)  And ah--
F:
Was there, was there a name for that society?
B:
[Madeiran Al-alienza].  (F: uh-huh)  [Madeiran Alienza].  Something like that.  I can't 
think of the whole name.  (F: uh-huh)  And they still got his picture in the club.  Some club up 
here, you know.  And people didn't have no money to get buried.  So if they had five hundred 
members when they ah, when there was somebody deceased, somebody died, they would have to
pay one dollar more to help pay and (F: uh-huh, I see) they, like they would give uh was either a 
thousand dollars or something like that to help pay that--there was no insurance.  (F: mm-hm) 
There was nothing, (F: mm-hm) see.  And uh, my father helped, helped form one of those 
societies.  (F: ah-huh)  My father had a good, good penmanship.  Oh, he could write like you 
thing.  He was, he was an intelligent man.  I don't know what schooling he had, you know what I 
mean.  I didn't know what schooling he had.  (F: mm-hm) But uh, eh, people used to look up to 
him and he used to go like to Immigration and talk to a, for a lot of people, you know, that they 
came, you know.  He would, he would go, you know, (F: mm-hm) and help them and take the 
American papers and things like that.  (F: oh! uh-huh)  But they--I only, I only had him until I 
was fifteen years old.  Yes, yeah.  He was very good to me; very, very, very good to me.  I could 
ask him for--in them days a nickel was a lot of money, but "I want a nickel for an ice cream," "I 
want a nickel for a hot dog."  (F: yeah)  The man would se--never say no.  He never said no to 
me.  He'd get up at two o'clock in the morning and go and deliver bread, and I would follow him.
Many a time--right here, we used to live on Charles Street down here, (F: uh-huh) and I'd be 
following him--the police officer said "Sir, if you wake up that boy to go with you at two o'clock 
I'll have you arrested."  I says, he says "I don't call him, he gets up."  I used to, I used to ah l-like 
my father.  I use to go with him all the time.
F:
Did--you said your father came here to work in the mills?
B:
Yeah.
F:
What--how old was he when he came [both talking]  
B:
Geez, I, I wouldn't--
F:
You wouldn't know? 
B:
I wouldn't know, see.  To tell you the truth.  Well--
F:
But he wasn't a child?
B:
No.  See, now he was fifty, I think he was fifty-one, when I was fifteen.  (F: mm-hm)  
So, he, he was here a very, very short time before I was born.  So fifteen, be thirty-five huh?  
Thirty-five, thirty-four.  I'd say he's, he was around thirty years old when he came from the old 
country.  (F: mm-hm)  [pause: 10 sec.]  I uh--
F:
Well, um and did, did he meet your mother here, or--
B:
No, they were married in the old country.  (F: uh-huh)  They were married in Madeira. 
They have different, like uh villages, provinces, whatever you want to call them.  Villages, you 
know.  And he came from one, one--I don't know if, if he came from the         and my mother 
came the place called         .  Different, different (F: uh-huh) names.  (F: uh-huh)  Now the, your 
Portuguese people would probably know that.  What, what part of the Portug-Portugal do they 
come, those Portugue--
F:
Almost all of them are from the Azores.
B:
From the Azores, huh?
F:
Uh-huh.  And then there's kind of a, a mixture, (B: yeah) but mostly St. Miguel.  It 
seems like.
B:
St., St. Miguel, yeah.  (F: yeah, mm-hm)  The St. Miguels, ah, they're good to sing, 
they c--what they call        , you know.  They're (F: uh-huh, uh-huh) very, very, very good.  I, I, I 
used to go someplace, New Bedford or something like that, there's quite a few of them out there. 
There's s-some from all over, but they were the ones with the best--I used to think that they used 
to sing the        , you know what I'm talking about?  (F: yes)  Though they sing, (F: yes) they 
answer each other.
F:
O-o-h yes!  (B: yeah) They, and then they make it up as they go along?
B:
Yeah, they make            (F: yeah, yeah)  They think that these um, ah country song, 
country music--  If these people ever wrote th-some of those lyrics, these old-timers that died, if 
they wrote those lyrics, which were the pure ones, you know what I'm talking about?  (F: uh huh)
They didn't have television.  To bring it up, these are things brought up from their own minds, 
you know.  (F: right, uh-huh)  They would make these songs look sick.  I remeber that.  (F: yeah)
I remember delivering bread to man, he used to live way up in back, back to Lowell Cemetery, 
he had a house way, way in.  He was an old man and I was just a kid.  And he says "You know, 
Emmanuel," he says, "my grandfather--" now he's an old man and he's his grandfather, (F: 
mm-hm) he says "There's going to be a thing that's going to carry people from Portugal to 
America."  Now there's a man that [interviewer laughs] never read, never read, never knew--huh?
(F: yeah)  He, he must have had--tell me how a man like that could think. 
F:
Well, I, do you know I think he was thinking independently as if, (B: see) I mean, if 
he'd had the position, he would have been an inventor of something like an airplane.
B:
Yeah, see.  (F: yeah)  He says something that's going to bring people from--they don't 
have to go in boats, (F: no) take months, (F: yeah) it's going to go--fly!  (F: yeah)  And he was an
old man. I never (F: yeah) forgot that, never forgot that.  I used to say that (F: uh-huh) to my 
teacher in school a lot of times I used to say that.  I don't know, I think I talk too much.
F:
Oh!  I don't think you talk too much.  [Mr. Barros laughs]  This is wonderful!  Are 
you, are you--
B: 
See, it's a--
F:
--getting ready to stop now?
B:
No!  I mean ask me questions.  If I can answer them, ah when I'm all done, I'll go and 
ask my daughter-in-law, she talks a lot.  [both laugh]
F:
A-ahm, let me think.  Oh, yeah, there was--I wanted to ask you um, um another thing 
about your father.  If he came here to work in the mills, did he then work for somebody else's 
bakery and then buy it or--
B:
Well, he, he was working in the mills, and then this--there was a fellow, like I told you,
one of the cousins or something like that, that stayed in the house.  He became a partner in here.  
(F: oh! uh-huh)  Somehow or other, see, he, he was a worker and he was single, he had money, 
and, and I think in them days you could buy a partnership like fifteen hundred dollars or 
something like (F: mm-hm) that, see.  And he bought a partner, partner here, and he asked my 
father if he wanted to.  And my father started--you know--helped over here, yeah.  And then 
something happened, my father left, then my father opened his own bakery way up in, in the 
Greek, it was in the Greek territory.  There was, there was a baker shop there.  (F: mm-hm)  See. 
F:
Is that The Acre?  Is that what they call The Acre?
B:
No, ah-- [yells]  What would they call the Greek section?  Not The Acre, huh?  
[woman talks in background]  The Acre th--  (Second woman: The Acre originally was the Greek
section.)  Yeah.  (First woman: The Acre was the what?)  (Second woman: the Greek section, 
wasn't it?)  (First woman: Oh, yeah!  I come from The Acre.)
F:
You do?
B:
[yells] Around uh Adams Street, Adams Street, Lewis Street?  That The Acre?  
[response unclear]  Yeah, okay.  So my father, he came from that--he opened a baker shop (F: 
ah-huh) there.  Well, he was, he was just a delivery man, so he hired two guys that were related 
to these guys here.  (F: uh-huh) And he was selling a lot of bread.  Oh, he was taking so many 
customers away these people here.  (F: ah-huh)  So my father one morning went, went to the--
