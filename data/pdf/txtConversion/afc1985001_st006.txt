Mrs. Sullivan Shafter, 1940
All in the merry month of May When the green buds they were swellin' Young Jimmy Gray
on his deathbed lay For love of Barbrew Ellen.
He sent his men unto them then To the town where she was dwellin' Saying, you must to
my master come If your name be Barbrew Ellem.
For death is printed on his face And o'er his heart is stealin' Oh you must you must come
to him Oh lovely Barbrew Ellen.
