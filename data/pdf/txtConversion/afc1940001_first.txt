First She Would and Then She Wouldn't[OH O YOU NAUGHTY, NAUGHTY MAN!?]illegible sentence[To
an evening party ???]An I met [?] a nice young girl[!?]Dress'd, O [????]My head [soon hit in a swirl.?]I
asked her if she'd dance with me,She gave a languishing smile,She wouldn't say "No" she didn't
say "Yes,"She'd quite a peculiar style.Chorus [md] First she would, and then she wouldn't,Then she
smiled, and said "she couldn't,Then she said, "Oh my, you shouldn't,O you naughty, naughty man!"I
sat down by the fair one's side,and handed her wine and cake!I told her what I'd do and dare,For
such a darling's sake.She hung her head, and smiled, and giggled,Her giggle to me was [?]!And when
we parted [so?] that night,I tried to steal a kiss. [md] Chorus.I often met her after that,And I'd take
here and there,And every time I got a chance,My passion I'd declare.I've vowed to be true on the
top of St. Paul'sOn the Underground [Rail?], Richmond Hill,And last I said, "if she wouldn't wedBy
jingo, myself I'd kill." [md] Chorus.I thought it was "right," and so I hadThe [?] put up "on [?]."And sent
my love a "sweet silk dress,"Her darling self to deck.Upon the wedding morn I called,My intended
bride to find.Not dressed at all, and worst of all,She'd not made up her mind.Spoken [md] She said
she thought [md] Chorus [md] At first she would, then she wouldn'tAnd then [?], she though she
couldn't.And then she said, "I [?] shouldn't.And I was a naughty, naughty man."Well, after that, we
married were,And we're pretty jolly at home;To one thing, though, my wife objects,That's when I
wish to roam.She says that "home's the proper placeFor all good married men,If I trot out at night I
haveTo be in bed by ten.Spoken [md] As for [losing?] me have /the latch-key [md] Chorus [md] Once
she would, but now she wouldn't,I say "she could," she says "she couldn't,"She say, "what's more,
she's sure she shouldn't,"And I'm a naughty, naughty man.
