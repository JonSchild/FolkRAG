cross trained to do other things. Now, sometimes on Christmas, I'll go to silversmith department

holidays when all they're busy so I do that, too.
KC  0:38
So you know a lot.
GA  0:39
Yeah, a lot!
KC  0:39
Um, and I want to start with just some basic biography questions. When and where were you 
born?
GA  1:02
I was born in Ghana. In a city called Takoradi. I was born in 19--- 1972. Yes.
KC  1:19
And what was your path to the US?
GA  1:23
That's, that's funny, because, uh, my uncle---- my uncle's living in Greensboro here. And he had a 
friend he--- I think it was called "working at cornmeal[?]" it's shut down now. But he was 
working with my, my late husband. And so they were friends. So, I always wanted to travel. But 
then my uncle, makes my husband---- well, my husband always wanted to marry African, African 
woman, so they get to talk. And my uncle told him that he have a niece, that is a good girl. So if 
he's interested---- so that's how we got to talk on the phone, maybe six months. And he he made a 
trip to Ghana. We got married, and he came back. And I think it took--- -he came and did my 
papers and everything. And then he sent for me and I came here. So that's how I got here.

KC  2:16
How old were you when you came?
GA  2:17
24.
KC  2:19
What did you think....?
GA  2:21
....about?
KC  2:21
.... the change, from Ghana to Greensboro?
GA  2:26
Oh, when I'm first very came my the---- it was the weather.  We came in November. And it was
cold! Okay, but then the, the sun was so high up. So my husband went to work. And so I was in
the house, and I think I was doing stuff and I said ok and I went and the sun was so bright. So I
had the little skirt on the little top on and I ran outside and, boy! I had to run back in the house
because I thought---- the sun is up in Africa, when the sun is up, you know, it's hot. But the sun
was up but then it was chilly, was  so you know it's November. So that was my [inaudible]. And
another thing, that was funny was that when, I came I came with my cousin. She was 19. Our
very first job was getting a job at the hotels, cleaning hotels. So it was very, very, very cold. But
um, that hotel wasn't built inside. You know where is the one that has the old type that have the
steps outside. That way you can climb outside to leave your cart outside when they clean up.
And I think that very day was very, very cold. So we got so cold that our hands was so freezing.
So we ran inside the house. It was it was built like the ones that have the the stove and all of that
in---- I don't know, yeah. So we ran in that, turned the hot water on stuck our [laughs, gestures].
It was the worst feeling! So yeah, my my cousin was like, Oh, boy, I wish I didn't come to this
country. Because that was--- we thought that has been so freezing. Putting the hot water on it will
help but that made it worse.
JG 4:12
Too much of a shock to the system.
KC  4:15
And you don't know if it's cold all the time, or for how long.
afc2020009_001--Grace Aiken interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
GA  4:19
Yes, it's gonna be yes. Yes.
KC  4:22
Did you work in Ghana before?
GA  4:24
Yes, yes.
KC  4:25
What did you do?
GA  4:26
Yeah, so um in Ghana, I was a beautician. I was a hairstylist. Where I do--- we do the hairstyle
and we do pedicure and manicure. I started that when I was in Liberia. So when I was maybe,
let's say 15, my mom w---- my mom traveled to Liberia that's a different African country. So I
went there to join my mother, so I help my mother out a little bit and I started to learn the
hairdressing. And then the war, 1998 they had a tribal war. I don't know if you guys familiar with
that war. So that sent us back to Ghana. So I'm back, I'm going back to Ghana, the lady
unfortunately---- she opened up another shop in Accra. So when I heard about it, I travel from
Takoradi back to Accra. And then that's how--- so I was there.  I worked with her till I was
maybe 24. And that's when I met my husband and I came down here. So I was the beauty---
beautician.
KC  4:26
Okay, so beautician, hotel, how did you find yourself in repair?
GA  5:34
Over here. So over here. Um, my cousin---  that same cousin now that I talked about, she found a
job at Replacements. So she told me about it. So I came in and I fill  application. So when I
came, I was first--- that I was hired to become a polisher. So when they say polisher, you're
polishing the spoon, you know the---you polishing the spoon and stuff. So there was one day, the
supervisor, I forgot his name, he came to me, and he handed me a spoon to polish. But I looked
at this spoon, this spoon was all bent up, you know, [inaudible] in it and everything. But he asked
me to polish it. So, I looked at it, and I took the sanding wheel. If you guys was inside, you
probably would know about sanding wheel. It's a course wheel where you can take paints and
stuff out of the spoon. So [inaudible] polish it should just you're polishing it to make it shine.
But, if you have a piece and like stuff it needs you want--- I want to, he---- that's a supervisor,
you know. I just got hired maybe three months. So I'm thinking, he tried to test me to see that I
know what I'm doing. So I took the sanding wheel and I shaved the spoon and I just you know,
afc2020009_001--Grace Aiken interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
I'd make it like different spoon. And he came and I handed it to him and he was like, "who did
this?" And I said, I think you gave it to me, right? I think if it's nobody, I did it. So what they was
trying to do is that they was looking for someone to bring to repair. But I guess they was testing
people to see your ability. I mean, what what they can do. I didn't know. I was, I--- I didn't even
know that they have a restoration department. I didn't know that. All I thought--- I thought they
was doing polish.  Back then the polishing was this side, restoration was on this side. So I had no
idea. So I just did the work. And then he told me, okay, so he went to see the manager. Then it
was was Jose, so Jose call me in his office and he said you going to restoration. China
restoration. And I was like, what is that? And then he told me that they do repairs over there. So
that's when I got to--- I met Horace. So we just we've been working together since then. Maybe
20, 20---- 23 years? Yes.
JG 7:58
Wow. So you really showed some independent work ethic there. And they were impressed.
GA  8:03
Yes. Because to be a hairstylist, you have to have the eye. You know, you have to be able to cut
the hair. No, you know how to--- if we doing a wrap or whatever, you have to put the shape in so
you have to be good at what you do. You have to have the eye for what you are doing. If you
don't have the eye you won't be able to do the work.
JG 8:28
So your kind of creative underpinnings with the hairstyling translated really well...
GA  8:33
Yeah.
JG 8:33
.... into restoration.
KC  8:35
It's like sculpture for your head.
GA  8:37
Yes, exactly. Yes.
JG 8:41
So what was the first thing you learned to repair when you did the transition to the new
department?
afc2020009_001--Grace Aiken interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
GA  8:49
When, when they put me there I think the Horace put me down with china, like china plate. So,
he first taught me how to hold the drill and bit because I've never hold the drill bit, drill bit
before. And I remember, why he was like "you know the bit just like I do!" That's what he told
me, you hold the bit just like I do. Because I'm kinda, I like to see---- to do you know, I will
watch you whatever you doing. I will watch you and I can do exactly what you are doing. That---
I don't, I don't even know it but that's just me. So, I guess I was holding and I was paying
attention to him. And if you really want to learn then you don't have you don't have to be upset
about stuff. You know you have to be open and just listen and you just look at the person. And
that's what I say [inaudible]. And, um, I remember one time I had a dinner plate but the chip was
at the bottom and they were saying it was expensive. But what they did was, we have a fly
ground [?] wheel.  So if the chip is at the bottom so if you fly ground [?] that take the shape off
of it. But they told me that this is expensive. So I fly ground [?] it enough to have the shape, and
then I went to the wheel and then I put the shape back on the bottom so that it won't be just flat.
But you put a shape, you know, because if it's flat like this, and then the bottom have maybe a
little shape on it. If you go to the edge, you go around and shape the edge and it goes inside of it.
You are running shaving and then polishing, it will be like it belongs. So, tried to make it as
much as the way it was, you know. It might not be perfect, but if you [inaudible], you do the fly
grind [?] complete, then people will know that this is---  this has been worked on. But if you try
to come at, the edge will be sharp. So you kind of take the edge off.  Soften the edge at the
outside, suddenly to the inside. And then you kind of put the polish on it. Plus, even when you
put water on it, some plates polish well. So.
JG 10:50
So if you made a direct comparison, you'd be able to tell, but on its own it looks enough like the
original.
GA  10:57
Original. Yeah.
JG 10:58
It's invisible. Yeah. And did you come up with that idea or was that learned on the job?
GA  11:05
No, I come up with the idea. Because I was--- they was telling me that this is expensive. Okay,
so doing the fly grind [?] alone is going to be---- is going to take the shape out of it. So I mean,
we on it, we might as well try--- try to do something. So I was wanting to do some--- do what I
can to, be able to, be able to sell it. Yeah.
afc2020009_001--Grace Aiken interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
KC  11:10
So you worked with Hor[ace], and Horace specializes in china, correct?
GA  11:35
Yes.
KC  11:35
So how long--- because now you're, you're cross-trained. So tell us about....
GA  11:40
The cross-train.
KC  11:41
Yeah.
GA  11:41
Okay, so the cross training, let's say.... Silversmith---- plating and, gold plating and silver plating
department. I think they asked me to go and help them out. Somebody--- it was one of the guy, I
forgot his name. I can't remember his name. But he was like, "Grace, I think you'd be good at
plating." Well you might, you want to learn I say "sure." So, so I went then and did they show me
how to do plating for the fork or a spoon. You just have to tape, tape, tape where you don't want
the gold to get on and then leave the path that you want to gold to like--- what do you call what
do you call get on it.  So, and then once you tape it, yeah, you put the tape on then you cut where
you want the gold to be left on. You cut it and then do--- they have wire, wire that ah, they have
the solution they--- I don't know have you guys have been in there before? Okay, well I guess
when we open [after COVID restrictions] you guys will be able to see, but they have a solution.
So the--- they have some of the metal you have to activate it first before you put the gold or the
silver on. Some of them is quality. So you just--- you can go straight to the gold. But the one that
you need to activate the having they, have the wire you tie the wire on the piece to get the
contact. And then they have the solutions. So, they have --- something in the solution so there'll
be another wire over there. So the wire is inside and you have your wire and it has the clip,
electric clip that you hold the piece with or you hold the wire with, and then you drop it in, And
then you kinda, what you call, turn it way--- sometimes it goes so high but you turn it high a little
bit just first get a contact. To pick it up and see that it had the contact, you will see.  And then
you put it lower and leave it in there maybe for three minutes, five minutes to get the gold on it.
And the plating is the same most of the silver plating--- silver plating take the whole piece. So
you just have somebody come wipe the piece really good.  If it's have--- pits and stuff in it you
go polish it to get the scratches and stuff out of it. And then come and wash it really good. And
then maybe they have a rinse water you rinse it real good you rinse it.  And then you put it in
afc2020009_001--Grace Aiken interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
the--- you put it the copper. If, if you need to activate, then you've got to activate first. Then you
go to the copper. Then you go to the silver. So maybe three minutes step by step.
JG 14:24
It's electroplating?
GA  14:25
It's electroplating. Yeah.
JG 14:26
That's so cool, that's a great description of it.
GA  14:28
Yeah.
JG 14:30
So then you started doing that and you--- you were a natural at that, it sounds like, too. You just
pick things up very quickly.
GA  14:37
Yeah,
JG 14:38
So they found a good resource in you.
GA  14:40
Yes.
JG 14:42
And what else?
GA  14:43
In the silversmith department, where they polish---- they polish the the, handcraft pieces. So the
hand--- handcraft pieces, and then sometime they, they will use regular knife, and they will make
a steak knife out of that. So you have to cut that. That's John's and them thing. Yeah, that they---
they know more about that because over there I go there during the holidays. So I'm picking up
how--- learning how to do the steak knife, and then the cream soup [spoon]. So they get a----  it's
a regular soup, soup that is square or whatever, or angle like that. And you have to have a
measurement, for the cream, cream soup is round. So you put that in there, you have your mark
or you mark it. And then you go to the wheel to cut. And then put the shape on it and polish. But
afc2020009_001--Grace Aiken interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
they have a bunch of different things that the silversmith did. They're good at what they do. But
I'm in there, so I'm learning.
KC  15:38
And is it the holidays because....
GA  15:41
It's busy.
KC  15:41
Silver is busy during the holiday?
GA  15:43
Yes, they are very busy during the holidays. And our department see--- silver deal with mostly
customers. So they have customer's stuff coming in, and they have orders coming in. And most
of the orders have to be handcraft. That department do handcraft too.  So, with them, that's
what--- but in our department we have--- I don't know, Horace told you about the towers?
Towers where we cut the--- a dinner plate. He didn't tell you guys?
JG 15:45
No.
GA  16:14
I'm surprised he didn't! Okay. So we have, we have different--- we have, uh,  three tiers, I'll tell
you about, it it's three tiers. You can buy DP [dinner plate], salad, and BB [bread and butter].
Dinner plates, salad plate and bread and butter. The small ones is bread and butter, the middle is
a salad plate and then the big one is DP [dinner plate]. So we have a [inaudible] it's a like, we
call it three tiers. And we have something measured where we can center the center. The center
drill, and then we have the--- we have the, how you call it? The metal that goes in between, so
you measure them so it like you have a metal in between but then you screw the DP down you
screw the--- that is, they call it three tier.
KC  17:01
This is for display?
GA  17:02
This--- people buy them. Yeah, they will order them---- they will order the plates, and we'll put a
hole in it and then we give them the metal to go with it. So [inaudible]--- they get it at home,
they'll put it together. When you come, it's there. We have a display thing that if you----  if
afc2020009_001--Grace Aiken interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
somebody wanted to do, they want this, then we do that for them. And then, we have we have a
nightlight. Nightlight where we use a cup and saucer.
KC  17:07
Nightlights?
GA  17:10
Nightlights. Yes, you have cup and saucer. So if---- somebody will just want a cup, somebody
will want a cup and saucer. So if you order the cup, and so say you want to nightlights, what we
do is we have, how you call it, chainsaw. I set water running over it. So we put the cup. First we
have to put the hole in the cup. [Inaudible] maybe hole this big we have the bit there. So we drill
the middle. Then you take the cup, the what you call, the chainsaw, and then you just hold it
steady. Okay, then you go [makes a noise]. And it will cut the cup how you want it. And then you
measure the cup with the with the saucer because it's supposed to level out. Now so you put it
out--- 'cause some people can just look at it, but I like to, what they call, mark or mark it. And
then I'll take myself to the--- and cut that to, to the level. And we have a fly ground [?] wheel
where we can hold it to make it flat, and then you take it to the wheels that will polish it. To
make sure that it won't cut because once you cut it on the chainsaw, it's rough, so you have to
smooth it. Then once you do that, then we have the nightlights, we have the electric part and we
can--- we glue it together. So you're going to glue the saucer and then the cup together and then
plug the thing inside. And then make sure, when you will let it sit maybe 30 minutes? And then
plug it on the on the sock--- sockchess. How you call it, sockchess?
JG 19:05
Socket.
GA  19:06
Socket, yeah, to make sure that it works. For the, what they call----  bulb, light bulb in it making
sure.
KC  19:13
So it's like you cut the cup and saucer in half?
GA  19:16
Half. And then glue it together. They should have at least bring something out here, just to, just
for y'all to see. I can go and bring some.
JG 19:25
I'm just imagining everything. Maybe we can have you bring them out for your portrait?
afc2020009_001--Grace Aiken interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
GA  19:30
Yeah.
JG 19:32
So there's a lot of creativity behind the scenes.
GA  19:35
Yes. And that's the nightlights and we have--- we make towers [?] for---- they have a letter, a
letter lett--- letter holders. Why we have a---- we get these box. It's made--- I don't know how I
should explained this thing. Letter holder and then we have--- I can't even think of the name. If
[name] would be here she'd probably would be able to tell you the name. But we have to cut the
DP, the dinner plates. We have a measured--- Horace makes the measurement, it's like a
[inaudible].  So we put the--- we get a DP.  And people will have, they have different patterns,
you know. Like they have plates, they have cups and stuff like that. So they want to [inaudible].
Like let's say they're having a big dinner, they want to have all the pieces that we have. And so
this is part of why they will put the napkin holder---- why they will put the napkins in between
that. Have you ever seen the napkin holder that's: inside, inside, and then you put your knife in in
the middle? It's something like, sorta like that. But what we'll do is...
KC  20:42
Using the middle of a dinner plate.
GA  20:44
Yes. So yeah, so we have that---- we all of those that, what do you call, wood and it have the
space there. Okay, so we cut the DP and then we'll make sure that we use the fly ground [?]
wheel to shape its shape. And sometimes you have to, you know, shape it the way it is. And then
we glue it inside that plate. And that's---- it's like it's  a [inaudible] And we glue it in and that's
our tower [?] that we do. I'm surprised Horace didn't tell you guys that.
KC  21:15
No, we didn't learn anything about the nightlights.
JG 21:18
We were learning about his past lives.
GA  21:20
Oh, we have nightlights and we also, we also have a---- we have a bell like, a bell crystal bells
where we,  are the....
afc2020009_001--Grace Aiken interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
KC  21:31
Wine glasses?
GA  21:32
Yes. Yes. And then we shape it. And we glue the little thing in between.
JG 21:39
So you're on some of the production and of these custom pieces.
GA  21:44
Yes. Yeah.
JG 21:46
It sounds so fun.
GA  21:47
It's fun. Yeah.
JG 21:48
We're getting a sense of how, how creative and, and sort of action packed it is behind the scenes.
GA  21:55
Yes, yes.
JG 21:57
So in the ceramics, do you do you also--- and crystal, is there also decal application?
GA  22:04
Yes. Crystal--- we, some people will buy just a plain crystal. And we have Terry [?] [inaudible]
we'll put the gold trim on there and then we'll fire it. Yeah. And maybe they told you about
scratches on the plate. If we---- most of the, most of the suppliers they bring pieces that is
scratched off. And so we have glaze, we have pieces that we will be able to fire. Pieces  that we
will be able to--- we test fire them, Horace does a bunch of them, I've done it before. We test fire
them. So if we can fire them then--- some pieces when you test fire it, it might it might not--- if it
come out dull, that means it is glazed [?]. So we just have to glaze it. We have a glaze--- glaze,
which we will glaze it and then fire it again and then it will be glossy. That they---- the scratches
will be gone. And then it will be glossy. Some plates we cannot fire. So it---  piece like that, we
just have to, what it called, polish it. We have a machine that water runs over it. And then if the
piece is coarse enough, then the water, water run [inaudible] you polishing. You cotton [?] it once
you polishing it. And so by the time you finish, it will be glossy, like the chip wasn't there. So.
afc2020009_001--Grace Aiken interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
KC  23:31
Which do you enjoy more out of those: silversmith plating, working with Horace and china?
What do you enjoy the most?
GA  23:42
I think each every, each of every one is unique. So wherever they put me, I do the best that I can
do. So wherever you put me, I'm not going to say "this is not my department." So I'm not going
to slack over there. Even--- if I go out, that's when I show up. I show off so that they can, you
know, they can come and testify about me. So if I go to eat, you get more work out of me when I
go different department because I will show them that--- I show them what I got. So that's who I
am. But if I mean I mean, I don't like people that slack of, at, when it comes to work and stuff
like that. So I'm also the kind of person that if I walk in, and this is not supposed to be here, I
will do it. I'm not complaining. I like to, you know, I feel like you were---- "ah, I'm here, I think
I'm here to sleep..." I came to work. So if I'm vain, whatever it takes for me to get the work done
then I'll do that. Most of [inaudible]... Walk in there and then grab this and do---- I don't think I
like, um--- I like to be told stuff to do you know? So, so I will go ahead and do it before you can
come and tell me what I need to do. So I'm....
KC  24:04
Just like with the spoon.
GA  25:00
Yeah. [laughs] So, that's how I am.
KC  25:07
Grace. You are the first woman we are interviewing.
GA  25:11
Oh, wow. Yay!
KC  25:12
Yeah! We're so happy. We have talked to a lot of men who do repair but not very many women
doing repair professionally.
GA  25:23
Oh, wow. I love it. I love it. It's independent. If you know what you're doing. It's very, very
independent. I don't like, it, I guess---- Like I said, I don't like to be told what to do. You know?
So, if I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna do it right. And I'm just gonna show you that I can do this. But
that's, that's who I am and, so.
afc2020009_001--Grace Aiken interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
KC  25:45
Are there many women at Replacements?
GA  25:48
Yes.
KC  25:48
That do the physical repair work?
GA  25:52
My department is three women. We have Terry that do the crystal thing. And Terry does other
stuff too. She is---- if a piece needs to be, maybe filled in, something like that, to [inaudible], she
can do that. So the, [inaudible] Cathy do a lot of crystal repair. Now having to--- I know how to
do crystal repair too. Crystal repairs take more water and cut down--- well a crystal is very, what
they call like a delicate?
KC  26:23
Fragile.
GA  26:23
Fragile. Yes. So Cathy does the crystal repair. But silversmithing department you cross--- and so
I know how to do crystal repair. So our department is three. When you go to silversmith, really
there's no woman. In the in the silver department but there's several polish--- polishing. And I
think probably over there I think maybe three women in there.
KC  26:38
And that's where you started?
GA  26:49
Yes, yes. Then it was a bunch of women. Then. But now it's mostly men. But you have a
[inaudible]]. I think maybe three or four people in there. But then they had, they've crosstrained
the people that do the [inaudible]. So Christmastime they bring some of them in there to help out.
Yeah, but silversmith. There is no woman in silversmith right now. They have the women that do
we do the [inaudible] stuff but the guys is bunch of guys, and I enjoy being in there with them.
So look at them. See what they do. Yeah, I think for me, maybe in future I probably will end up
silversmith. I've been offered to go there. But the only reason----  it get cold in there. So I would
like, I'll help you when it's, you know, holidays when you need me. Yeah.

Is your cousin still at Replacements?
GA  27:47
No, she's not here, she left. She left me a long time ago. She's not, yeah, she she's she worked for
the healthcare systems, though.
JG 27:56
Do you think being a woman in this environment that's mostly male dominated gives you any
special insights or power?
GA  28:05
Um, I say yes.
JG 28:08
What, what would those be?
GA  28:10
Um, to be able to do what they doing, to be able to walk in and then maybe help them out for---
show them that I can do what they are doing. Yeah.
KC  28:25
Are there, it it anything about....? Naw, I've changed my mind, I won't this question. Why do you
like this work? 23 years. Why, why stay? Why do you like it?
GA  28:41
I guess it---- Replacements is a good place to work. And, I have the flexibility to be to be able to
I mean, if I want to have a time off, I can do that. If--- I have, I brought my parents here too,
when I came when I came I brought my parents, I have elderly father here. And that's the job that
if I want to take off early to go take my dad to appointment, they allow me to. I have two girls. I
told my husband---- he's deceased, my husband passed away. So I take care of these children. So
I think, I had the--- the flexibility is there and I'm comfortable with it. And I think I make a
pretty, pretty good money too. And I do a part time job too. So I have a part time job too. So I'm
good. So you're not full time here. I'm full time, I'm saying I have a part time job that I work at.
Here at the hotel. So, I was--- I haven't worked the, the year since the pandemic I haven't worked
there.  They call me back and I told them that I'm just gonna wait. Yeah.  I'm not--- I think I think
mostly, I think the flexibility that is here that, yes. That's what
KC  29:59
And you've been able to about learn so much.
afc2020009_001--Grace Aiken interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
GA  30:00
A lot. Yeah.
KC  30:02
Have you taught other people as well?
Unknown Speaker  30:06
Yeah. We have Maleek that came by he's, he's no longer here. He came, I taught him how to,
what do you call, do a bunch of the like the tower that I'm talking about. And other stuff I taught
him here.
KC  30:19
And what do you like about the work itself?
GA  30:22
The work itself?
KC  30:24
Like the actual, like what you do every day.
GA  30:26
I enjoy it. It it's--- it's it's not a job that somebody is turning on your head. Telling you what to
do. You know, so you grab this---- and I do color too. So the color is where, we will repair out---
I guess I will go back to your question. But the color is where, when we---- the chip is on the
edge of the piece, okay? And then when you do the repair, you take some of the color off. So you
gets to pick up the piece, go to the color, and we have the color sheet to find your color. So once
you find the ---- sometimes that you might not find it. So it's also you're taking the red, and then
maybe adding a little white as a way to get your color. So you have to mix it. And you might not
get lucky, get lucky. You mix it, you put--- you go get it fired, and then it will come out different
color. Then you have to try again. Or sometimes we'll have a color shade that we can test on the
tile and then fire it and it comes out right. And you do. So you get to mix colors and it gets
interesting. So it's not like you're doing one thing all the time. We can do this today--- if in two
hours and I feel like I'm tired, I'll go here and go do this thing, go here and do this. So. So what's
your question again?
KC  31:42
You answered it.
afc2020009_001--Grace Aiken interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
GA  31:43
Okay.
KC  31:44
I think you get to be creative.
GA  31:46
Yeah. So.
KC  31:49
And what's something you've worked on that you're particularly proud of?
GA  31:53
Mmmm--- I will say when....  when, I'm trying to think. When I first got hired, over there, I was
working with Horace. And the ver--- I think maybe three months he traveled and came back. I
was so happy to see him. Okay. He left some of the difficult pieces. I wasn't able to do it. But I
think the next time he traveled, came back, then everything was done. He was like, "wow!", so
around here, you can't even take a vacation without losing your job or something. Something like
that. So, God right there, made me---- I was able to, when he left, I was able to challenge myself
because I did all the easy replace. And then I have to tackle the hard one. Bit by bit. That's all
[inaudible]. So I think that even helped me more. So I was proud of myself then. So.
JG 32:49
Are there ever any times where you're working on something and it breaks further?
GA  32:54
Yes!
JG 32:54
You know? And what do you do in that instance?
GA  32:57
In might fall, fall from your hand and break. That is---- china, china breaks it's, it's gone. There's
nothing you can do. I remember--- oh, I will tell you this story. So when they first hired me in
polishing. So they have a piece called gold wash that I didn't even know and that's not plating.
Okay, so there was a piece, expensive piece, but it was a small jelly spoon or something like that.
But they have gold in the bowl. They call it gold wash. Okay. So I'm reading the paper, you
look---- you read it, it will tell you maybe this is a silver plate. It will tell you this is a sterling
silver, it will tell you this is stainless, whatever. And then this piece says sterling and but it says
gold wash. Okay, gold wash! So I took the wheel and I polish all the gold out of it. I thought it
afc2020009_001--Grace Aiken interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
said "gold wash" and so. I probably---- I took all the gold out and polish, like I said, I polish it
nice. And then when the inspector look at it, he said "Grace, this was supposed to be gold wash."
I said yeah, it says gold--- He says "the gold was supposed, the gold is supposed to stay in. Not
taking the gold off." So that was gold.... Yeah, that was some "Oh, okay, this thing is $100" you
know. So, but I didn't know that they can take it and go put the gold back on it. So that's
something that I was really, I was nervous because I haven't been here long. So that's something
that, that, what do you call--- I was sad about. Yeah.
KC  34:33
Sure. What's something you're proud of?
Unknown Speaker  34:37
A lot. A lot. To be able to do something that they think it cannot be done. That's my--- that's
something I like. Okay, this cannot, can't done, Okay, let's try it. You can--- that's the only way
you can---  you will know that whether that can be done or not. So I would like to try. I will take
it and try it and take the pleasure out of that. So, a lot, yeah.
KC  35:03
I think it's amazing. Everything comes back to that spoon.
GA  35:07
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. And he just took me over there. It wasn't something that even I knew
what I was doing. So that's how I work now. I came to Horace, and he went--- after a while he
was like, "you know you are the only person that I've worked that you--- they brought down here
that nobody are doing." You know, and I was like, I mean, I do it naturally, because I just, I just
do it. Give it to me. I want to make sure that I do, I do the good job on it. So.
KC  35:43
Were you like that way growing up?
GA  35:46
Oh, yes, I remember. I remember that. I remember that when I started doing the hair, working out
with a lady. She'll take me everywhere. She used to go in with the [inaudible] wedding. W--- do
the makeup for wedding people. And something like that. And she would take me everywhere.
And so, I guess that's what she sees in me. And then so, yeah, so. I'm, I'm, I guess growing up,
I'm kind of the "good girl", good child,  kind that don't want to do anything that I would get a
whopping, or anything. So always trying to do right thing, do the right thing. Yeah. So growing
up, not little girl that run here, run there, run here, run there. I try to do the best that I can.
afc2020009_001--Grace Aiken interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
KC  36:33
So you've been here for 23 years?
GA  36:35
Yes.
KC  36:35
How has it changed from when you started to now?
GA  36:38
Oh, a lot. When it first started, I guess when I first got here, I was trying to do the hair----
braiding hair at home, doing hair at home. But when I started here, was was working like---- you
work sixty hours if you want to. You know, 55 hours if you want to.  So it's a lot of overtime,
then. And then I think after two years, that's when I went and got a part time job. And after two
years, everything shut down. And we're just doing 40 hours. So, a lot has changed. You will say
that, when you first started, maybe 23 years ago, the money that she was making, then you're
probably not making it now. Because there was a lot of overtime. And so you're able to...
KC  37:20
Because there was less people?
GA  37:21
Um, they had a lot of business. I think they had a lot of business. The people was ordering
some--- I think a lot of people are maybe open up, open up a bunch of something like this. But,
they had reached [?] before that will buy stuff. They were just buying stuff. Every corner. And so
we was working seven days a week, six days a week. You know, you get one day to rest, and
you'd be able to save money. I brought my brother here, brought both of my parents here. You
know, I bought a land in Ghana. I was building a house in Ghana and stuff like that. So yeah.
KC  37:59
Oh really? Do you want to go back?
GA  38:01
Yeah, I think I will go back. Maybe when my children are working. I will, I would love to go
there. Winter time and I want to come back here summer time. So, that's my plan. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah. When I get, what you call, older.
KC  38:20
You could probably open a repair shop.
afc2020009_001--Grace Aiken interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
GA  38:23
That's what my brother was telling me. My brother just came, um, came from Ghana three
months ago, and he was like "this is---"  he came in doing part time here for a while. Temporary,
temporary. He said he came up he said "you need to go to Ghana open up a shop"  Just he said,
it's not like--- machines are expensive, he said open up a shop. You'd get restaurants that want to
polish their plates and stuff like that. My brother was talking to me about it. But the thing about
it is--- open up, open up something like that it, will take time because people will maybe send [?]
your money. They won't look at the business well for you while you not there. You guys see what
I'm trying to say? If you are there--- or you have to have someone that you could trust to be able
to take care of your, your thing. Your own things like the way you want to, yeah.
KC  39:18
Sure, but you have had an amazing education here. Training and all the different specialties. I
mean, you do carry knowledge that not many people have.
GA  39:31
Yeah. I might do it. He was talking to me about it. I told him it will take a [inaudible] because,
when you polish and stuff, you don't want to do this. He was like you can do it. Open it at your
house. And I said no, no, no, no, the compound is too much, the dust. So you want to have a
place where they have the filter system--- when yougo around it, they have their filters and stuff
that suck the air out and so you have to be able to do all of that and it takes time. And I have
children now my youngest is, um, she's 11 years old. So I can't just leave her like that. If her
father is here, it's different. But if I was nine years old--- I want to make sure that she's old
enough to be able to be responsible, you know. So before, I go. I guess kind of, I'm a mother, I
want to be able to, there are my---- they are girls. I want to be able to keep my eye on them. They
are [more] important than the money, you know. I could do that, but I want to be able to put my
children in the way that I know they're gonna be okay. That's my youngest--- she's in college. So
she's, she's good. But, ah--- my oldest, she's in college.
KC  40:41
Where?
GA  40:42
Oh, UNCG
JG 40:43
Congratulations. Near by.
KC  40:45
Do you still do hair?
afc2020009_001--Grace Aiken interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
GA  40:47
Oh....
KC  40:47
Just your family?
GA  40:48
My daughter, the youngest. That, that---- I haven't done hair in a while. I know, maybe eight
years ago, I went to Ghana and the girls that there was behind me--- you know, you have seniors
and stuff when she heard I was coming she was so happy. She said Grace, you know, I have to---
I want to come and then learn all, all the different styles. And I said, no, no, I'm not doing---- I
didn't do hair. Because the way I was--- I used to train them a lot. She thought that I'm still doing
it. So she want to learn from me about the hair. And I said, that's not what I did, I change up.
KC  41:22
Are there businesses like this in Ghana? When you explain to people from home what you do, do
they understand?
GA  41:29
No, they wouldn't. It's not there. That's why my brother said, that's going to be unique. You can
do that. Because you have the people with the restaurant, the hotels and stuff like that. There's
nothing like that over there. And that would be a great thing to do.
JG 41:43
Do you have interest in the history of the objects you work on? Or are they more just objects to
you?
GA  41:51
What's that?
JG 41:51
Like, do you, do you study the histories of the objects that you're fixing?
GA  41:57
No. No. Yeah.
JG 41:59
They're more just like a project to work on?
afc2020009_001--Grace Aiken interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
GA  42:02
Yeah.
JG 42:04
I was wondering because it seems like there's a kind of a spectrum like the serious collectors up
to, you know, where the artists [inaudible].
GA  42:17
Mm, mm, no.
KC  42:18
It's really windy, I can hear it.
GA  42:20
Oh in the thing?
KC  42:21
Yeah, so I'm letting it pass. We ask people if they have a favorite tool that you work with.
GA  42:34
No, no, not exactly. Not not---- I mean, the Dremel that we use, I will say the Dremel will help
will make---- you can sit down to use the Dremel. Okay, so I would say maybe that's that,
because the rest of them you stand up and then you know, run the water.
JG 42:54
But if you want a break....
GA  42:55
Yeah, sit down yeah. And then you know. Sometimes I even take a nap. You be, you be--- it gets
so warm in there if you using it you can be dozing off, and stuff like that, But I would say that's
that. That's a hand tool. So you cut it down, you shape it, you sand it, you sand it down a little
bit. You cut it down, sand down a little bit.
JG 43:17
It would be fun to watch you work I can see even just in the way you're gesturing that you're
very much part of your---- your hands know what to do.
afc2020009_001--Grace Aiken interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
GA  43:22
Yeah but yeah if you cutting a die [?] the chip is in there you're cutting the die you could go here,
then you go side--- because you want, you don't want to cut straight. You want to cut it while
you're shaping it. So that by the time to get finished the shape is there.
KC  43:40
Do you have any goals for being here for the next couple years? Like other things you want to
learn or....
GA  43:47
Like, I was--- that's what I was saying, the silversmith department. 'Cause they have a lot, a lot,
of different things that I'm interested in learning. So that is my goal. Anytime I, anytime I get a
chance in there every year go in there I want to go up one step ahead. You know, the pieces that
the learning I want to learn one more thing, one more thing. One more thing. Yeah.
KC  44:13
Do you get to work with customers?
GA  44:15
No, no. We just, I mean, we just probably go to the showroom every now and then but I don't
get--- I've been there to price some pieces but not a lot, yeah.
KC  44:26
So you don't necessarily know the stories....
GA  44:29
About yeah, no, I don't hear all their stories. No, no, I just, they bring it in and then we do
something for them. That's that.
KC  44:40
Do you have other questions, Julia?
JG 44:44
Such good, such good stories from back there you really bring it to life, Grace.
KC  44:49
So your title is sculpt---- sculptural....
GA  44:52
Apprentice--- apprentice two. [Inaudible] is one and then the two,  and then the Horace.
afc2020009_001--Grace Aiken interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
KC  45:02
I'm trying to think that like, what's the most sculptural thing you do? But I guess you were kind
of describing just, sort of the shaping after fixing and also making the lights---
GA  45:13
The nightlights. And, then the um, what else do we do, we have the night lights, we have the
[inaudible] we have [inaudible], what else?
JG 45:16
Do you fix figurines?
GA  45:28
Yes, we--- if it need to be repaired, we repair them. But if you need to be like---- we do glue
color too. So some pieces cannot be fired. And then so, we'll maybe build up a glue to fill it in.
And I can do some of that. And especially that one is Terry, [inaudible] she, she can put stuff
together. Put, you know, glue stuff together. So that, the figurine most---- that if it's so fancy and
stuff, we won't fire it, but we just build the glues where to what they call for the sheep or
whatever in it.
KC  46:09
Did you ever think you would do this kind of work for a living?
GA  46:12
No, no, no, no, no. I never, I never thought--- just coming here I thought I was coming to do hair,
maybe becoming a hairstylist, and, and you know, I know how to do pedicure and manicure and
stuff like that. And stuff like that. So that's what I thought I was coming over here to do. But then
when I came here, you know doing the braiding hair, doing the hair at home is just it comes one
once in a while. And going to--- I thought about going to somebody's place to get a booth to you
know, to work. And you have to have your own booth and, and all that. But then when I started
working here, like I said, I was making money. You know, I was working crazy hours. So I was
like, I don't have the time to do that. Even as a part time. Money is money. So I decided to stick
with this. So, with this, it wasn't planned thing to do, but I enjoy doing it. Because it makes me
independent, you know, to do what I'm doing. And if I have to--- I have a chance to learn more
with a silversmith, I have a chance to see if I really want to do something different. I can go in
there and do something different. But I'm open to any other thing that comes to my--- come in
life to do, yeah.
KC  47:32
Thank you so much for talking with us and sharing your story.
