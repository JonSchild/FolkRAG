Q. <unintelligible text>. talking about the different trees, what are some uses that you and
your ancestors have put to different types of trees?
A. Well, the chestnut oak tree was valuable to us to make <unintelligible text> We cut
and use lumber from it on account of it their being too hard but a boards quartered, split
quartered and you can pierce it will nail that way, but if it's slabbed off there's a <gap> nail
won't go through it after it's <gap> but now they make hardwood floors. They got machines
to put it down with. We use that to cover buildings with the very hard wood and white oak
boards, we use those for covering houses, buildings and the hickory was used for <gap>
and the white hickory, it greWd on the river, was used to make ox bows. You could bend a
2-inch bow without breaking it, perfect, out of it. It was for ox bows or <gap> to dry steel. It
was very limber, too limber for <gap> And then the ash tree, they was use for <gap> and
the most of the people back there used sourwood; <gap> made the sleds out of them. It
was a light strong wood and it could make a <gap> by taking a young grove and letting it
grow, just peel the bark and you had your hound. It was alright that way <gap> that way;
I still do it. <gap> got too high; maybe one costs you four dollars and if you look in the
woods you can cut you one for nothing. <gap> never has a splinter

A. They was <unintelligible text> it died around 1925 to 1927, I'd say, all the chestnuts
died. Back where I live where the mountains is <unintelligible text> they died in the
summertime and looked like the leaves cured on the trees. They was cured bright; the
leaves, they died so suddenly. It looked like somebody shut 'em with a shotgun all the
way around, and they grow to be 5 and 6 foot through and very tall make hundreds of
<unintelligible text> they would be valuable today if we had to make picnic tables and stuff
<unintelligible text>
Q. Well, what was wrong, a disease got the trees or what?
A. They say it was a blight, but it looked like the bark had been shot all the way around
maybe a 2-foot space on it up about; I'd say from ten to fifteen foot up on the tree all the
way around it <gap> the top died first.
Q. Well, are there any chestnut trees around now?
A. Well I'd like to go back to see here, probably fourteen year ago, I was back with a
boy deer hunting and was showing him some old chestnut logs that was still laying on
the ground, and I saw a chestnut leaf and I told him there was <gap> and got to looking
around and we counted oh, there must have been six or seven tall young trees in good
shape, and I wondered whether that blight got 'em or not, if it didn't they all should be now.
They growd fast, probably eight or ten inches in diameter.
Q. Did the <gap> go at the same time?
A. The <gap> went, but it come back. I went over where my folks is buried last August
and they were full <gap> bushes are hanging over the road, lots of <gap> I wanted to get

I went that evening.
Q. What use do you get out of a pine tree?
A. You can make boards out of it and use it for lumber and house <gap> and things when
you need them. Old people use them for <gap> as well as hardwood <gap> They used
anything they get and the reason they need those logs, huge logs don't never rot if you
keep it covered and a round log does. When you heat one, <gap> comes in the side where
you <gap> it don't come <gap> That's the reason they last this long. When they built those
houses out of 'em, they had no <unintelligible text> so they made the wooden hinge It
might be two hundred years old but it's still working. They didn't <unintelligible text>
Q. A while back we was talkin' about the rustle house and being a half way house and you
mentioned the wealth of the people; this was half way to where? Where were they going?
A. <gap> They had that cold spring there and the first <gap> she was come up drawd over
with some kind of rheumatism and they thought it was her washing clothes in that spring;
you know, being in that cold water too much. She <gap> they didn't have no walkers,
