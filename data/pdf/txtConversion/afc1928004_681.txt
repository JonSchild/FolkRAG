FACES WE'LL NEVER FORGET. 
As sung by FRA.sx LEWIS at Hyde & Behman's Theatre, Brooklyn. 
1. have sung of the topics and the events of the day, 
But now for the present I've something new to say; 
I 
will speak of the men you have heard of and seen, 
Whose name in our memory will ever be green; 
The first is a 
friend in the hour of need, 
Who will stretch forth his hand is a 
true friend indeed; 
When your pockets are empty, he'll stick to you yet. 
He's one of the faces we'll never forget. 
I 
will speak first of one in our hearts ever dear, 
And I'm sure our whole nation still wish he was here; 
A Martyr, a 
President, and worthy of mind, 
The exponent of right and virtue combined; 
lie was murdered in Washington some years ago, 
And how deeply our country has felt the blow; 
Though gone from us now, though gone, we find yet 
Old honest Abe Lincoln we'll never forget. 
New York in its day has produced some good men, 
Who are known from this city unto the world's end; 
Ther≤i's William Cullen Bryant who handled the pen, 
That has silenced the wrath of this world's greatest men; 
There's poor Tweed who died in Ludlow Street Jail, 
Whose life was a 
warning, a 
history, a 
tale; 
There's Fisk who was shot down whose loss we regret, 
These are some of the faces we'll never forget. 
The stage it has likewise produced some good names, 
Who have struggled how hard for honor and fame; 
There's Cushman, Davenport, Forrest as well, 
Sothern and others too numerous to tell; 
There's one who'll remain in our hearts even more, 
Though she's gone from our midst unto Heaven's bright 
shore; 
As dear a 
little maiden the stage hnashracl

NOT BEFORE PA, DEAR, 
As sung by COOL BUROES$. 
8ome lovers are so bashful, 
They will never say a 
word, 
But only blush and tremble, 
Which looks, I'm sure, absurd. 
While others they will kiss their love, 
Or know the reason why; 
But when my charmer's pa is near— 
These words are her reply— 
CHORUS. 
Not before pa, dear, not before pa, 
Say that you love me, but not before pa; 
Not before pa, dear, not before pa, 
I 
don't mind a 
kiss, dear, but not before pa. 
I'm very fond of flirting, 
But there's one I 
love best; 
I'm sure I'm rot too bashful 
In seeking love's request. 
Last night I 
went to see her pa, 
To squeeze her hand I 
tried; 
When I 
called her my little -
queen, 
These words she then replied— 
Not before pa, & c. 
We strolled into the garden, 
And underneath the trees, 
We sat upon the lovers" seat, 
To inhale the summer breeze; 
I 
told her how I 
loved her, 
Which caused a 
dreadful sigh; 
And when I 
said, " Oh, name the day," 
These words were her reply— 
Not before pa, au-
Flannel Mouth Mick. 
Words and music by BILLY WELCH, of WELCH and RICE 
qd rospeettr 
fully dedicated to Iklumo4v and MACK. 
I 
know you'll have pity 
When you hear what I 
say, 
The way I've been treated 
By the blackguards each day, 
Who stand around the corners 
As I 
pass them by; 
You can hear them say plainly, 
Arrah, stag the old guy. 
CHORUS. 
For they yell out, you terrier, 
Go shoot that hat quick. 
For they call me a 
chaw 
And a 
flannel mouth Mick. 
The other day, while out walking, 
I 
went down the street, 
A 
charming young damsel 
I 
did chance to meet. 
Says 1, you look charming, 
A cushla ma vick ; 
Says she, go drop on yourself, 
You °tad flannel mouth Mick. 
For they yell out. &c. 
When election day comes 
Shure I 
know what they'll say, 
It will be, Mr. McGinnis; 
How are you to- day? 
They'll hand me a 
ticket, 
Say, go vote it now, quick. 
I'm a 
gentleman then, 
And no flannel mouth Mick. 
For they yell out, &c.

Do To Others as You Wish To Be Done By. 
sang with tremendous success by NELLIE GERMON, the celebrated 
Protean Actress. 
-: 
0 : 
There's many's a 
man in this world of ours, 
Whose thoughts are all of self; 
Never thinks of the poor that live next door, 
As he rolls in his horded wealth. 
But there's a 
rule in the Book of Books, 
Says each man has to try 
And that's to do to others 
As you wish to be done by. 
CHORUS: 
Then jogging along through life, my boys, 
Let conscience be your school; 
And lay away for a 
rainy day, 
And observe the golden rule. 
Deserve success by energy, 
It will greet you bye and bye; 
And always do to others 
As you wish to be done by. 
To-day you are rich, when a 
sudden stroke 
May take your gold and lands, 
And then you'll find yourself in need 
Of a 
friend with a 
helping hand. 
Then perhaps you'll meet some one 
You've helped in days gone by, 
Just do to him as he did to you, 
As you wish to be done by.

INSANITY.

While running down the street one afternoon, 
For to catch a 
butterfly, 
I 
jammed my head into a 
big spittoon, 
Oh, how is that for high.

dog, 
Or a

There never was a

Oh, my, you can't catch me, 
(Break.) 
I 
feel just as happy as Jack Aberle; 
They call me a 
big bag of hay. 
Six times I 
lost my peck, 
Good evening white folks one and all, 
I've a 
gum bile on my neck. 
Oh, here I 
am a 
champion gay, 
Singing, dancing all the day, 
A 
regular Hanky Panky cove, 
I'm all dressed up in my Sunday clothes. 
I 
carry a 
razor in my sock, 
They say my face would stop a 
clock,

blasting rock, 
Oh, how is that for low. 
put on style with my stand-up collar, 
When I 
sing I 
never holler, 
Yon can bet your bottom dollar 
I 
never miss a 
meal. 
When I 
hear the music playing 
I 
rattle off my heel and toe, 
I'm Ernstus henry Johnson, 
And I've got tar upon my heel.

Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 1879. 
Oh my heart is gone but my gall remains, 
A charming girl went through me ; 
She took my cash, for I 
was too fresh, 
And she gave me a 
terrible skin. 
I 
was on the booze, I 
lay down to snooze 
The first time she beheld me, 
And she worked the fake, for the graft was great, 
And I 
seen her in my dreams. 
When she went through me; 
And she knew me! 
She worked me for my wealth. 
And didn't leave a 
nickel! 
She surprised me! 
She paralyzed me ! 
And she played me for a 
gilly all the while. 
CHORUS. 
That Italian gal, no I 
never shall 
Forget the day she worked me. 
I 
will let her be, for she roasted me 
I'm just as fresh as she. ( Dance) 
Oh that poison face got me off my base, 
And she played me for a 
gilly ; 
And said I 
was no good, and my name was mud, 
'I'ra-la-lee, George, look for Work, 
Then I 
pulled a 
pop and she took a 
drop, 
Then she did not seem so giddy. 
She winked her eye and gave me the guy, 
And she tickled me under the chin. 
She's as handsome 
As a 
handcart ! 
With her head stuck in an ash barrel— 
Picking cinders! (Sym.) 
She's a daisy ! ( Sym.) 
She's terrible lazy! (Sym.) 
And she played me for a 
gllly all the while.

DON'T PUT THE POOR WORKINGMAN 
DOWN. 
Words and Music by BOBBY NEWCOMB. 
fl•opyrighted, 1877, by F. W . 
HELMICK, No. 50 We Fota)th 
Street, Cincinnati, Ohio. 
Price 35 cents. 
How oft when we hear of misfortune, 
Befalling a 
friend or a 
foe, 
If in joy or regrets we express it, 
That's the way of the world you all know; 
I 
thought I 
would speak of a 
subject, 
Interesting each village and town, 
That is iron-heeled capital striving 
To put the poor workingman down. 
CHORUS. 
Let capital shake hands with labor, 
Let the poor have the bread that they earn, 
For surely they need every penny, 
Is a 
lesson quite easy to learn; 
Remember the poor love their children, 
So give them a 
smile, not a 
frown, 
Live, and let live, be your motto, 
Oh! don't put the poor workingmen down. 
That money is the root of all evil, 
Why all of us likely's found out, 
rho richer class think that the poorer, 
Should of pleasure know nothing about; 
The honest poor always will labor, 
They don't ask a 
title or crown, 
Why begrudge them sufficient to live on, 
Don't put the poor workingman down. 
Let capital, ete. 
So now in conclusion I'll mention, 
That life being dear to us all, 
The poorer class must have existence, 
So — -- don't push them close to the wall 
>Tow hope that in future. the richer 
On the poorer will smile and not frown, 
Who ask but enough just to live on, 
Don't put the poor workingman down. 
Let capital, etx-•

SMITING THE ROCK. 
Hit of the Day. 
Original, as Recited by M ISS N ELLIE GERMON. 
The stern old judge in relentless mood, 
Glanced at the two who before him stood. 
She was bowed and haggard and old, 
He was young, defiant and hold. 
Mother aud son, and to gaze at the pair, 
Their different attitudes, look and air, 
One would believe ere the truth were won, 
The mother convicted and not the son. 
There was the mother; the boy stood nigh, 
With a 
shameless look and his bead held high. 
Ar-e had come over her sorrow and care, 
There mattered but little so he was there. 
A 
prop to her years, a 
light to her eyes, 
And prized as only a 
mother can prize; 
But what for him could a 
mother say, 
Waiting his doom on a 
sentence day. 
Her husband had (lied in his shame and sin, 
And she a 
widow her living to win, 
had toiled and struggled from morn till night, 
Making with want a 
wearisome tight, 
Bent over her work with resolute zeal, 
Till she felt her old frame totter and reel, 
Her weak limbs tremble, her eyes grow dim, 
But she had her boy and she toiled for him. 
And he—he stood in 111e criminal dock, 
With a 
heart as hard as a 
flinty rock, 
An impudent glance and reckless air, 
Braving the scorn of the gazers there, 
Dipped in crime and encompassed sound. 
With proof of his guilt by his captors found, 
Ready to start, as he phrased it " game," 
Holding not crime but penitence shame. 
11 
SMITING TIIV ROCK.-CONTINUED. 
Pouring in a 
flood o'er the mother's cheek, 
The moistening prayers where the tongue was 
weak, 
And she saw through the mist of those bitter 
tears, 
Only the child in his innocent years; 
She remembered him pure as a 
child might be, 
The guilt of the present she could not see, 
And for mercy her wistful look made prayer, 
To the stern old judge in his cushioned chair. 
" 
Woman," the old judge crabbedly said, 
" 
Your boy is the neighborhood's plague and 
dread, 
Of a 
gang of reprobates chosen chief, 
An idler and rioter, ruffian and thief, 
The jury did right for the facts were plain, 
Denial is idle, excuses are vain, 
The sentence the court imposes is one  
" 
Your honor," she cried, " he's my only son." 
The jurors grinned at the words she spoke, 
And a 
ripple of fun through the court- room broke, 
But over the face of the culprit came, 
An angry look and a 
shadow of shame. 
" 
Don't laugh at my mother," loud cried he, 
" 
You've got me fast, and can deal with me; 
But she's too good for your cowardly jeers, 
And I'll"  
then his utterance choked with 
tears. 
The judge for a 
moment bent his head, 
And looked at him keenly, then he said; 
" 
We suspend the sentence, the boy can go," 
And the words were tremulous, forced and low. 
" 
But stay? And he raised his finger, then, 
Don't let them bring you hither again, 
There is something good in you yet, I 
know, 
I'll give you a 
chance, make the most of it, go."

WE 
are four dissipated tramps, 
And that you plainly see; 
We came all the way from Buffalo 
A week ago to day. 
We worked our way upon the cars, 
For money we hadn't a 
dime, 
Until we reached this city 
And our comrades here did join. 
CHORUS. 
Now don't sneer at us when we pass, 
Or say there goes a 
stager! 
Although we're victims of the keg, 
You'll find far worse than " Gaugers." 
This world owes us a 
living, 
And we'll have it to a 
man! 
So let no one despise us 
Because we carry a 
can. 
There's a 
branch that " carries the banner," 
That branch is called V. G.; 
But we're delegates from the " Gaugers," 
Which is far above that degree. 
We go our rounds within our bounds, 
So give us the respect we're due. 
We never go around singing:" hard up," 
Or " The faded coat of blue." 
Now don't sneer, etc. 
Bad scran to the " five- cent schooners," 
But it's them we do disdain! 
Since the first day they were introduced 
In the kegs there's not a 
drain! 
But before we turn the corner 
We'll fill our cans, we'll wager, 
And drink the health of " The Hard- up Club," 
And of our fellow " Gaugers." 
Now don't sneer, etc.

My dear old German home dot stands upon de Rhine, 
I 
am thinking of you, and it breaks my heart ; 
I 
left you long ago when I 
was a 
leedle boy, 
I 
never thought that from you I 
would part. 
My fader used to smoke his pipe mid mudder used to knit, 
Side by side dot flower-covered door; 
But der wheel by de mill now has turned de oder way, 
Und dose happy days viii come to me no more. 
CHORUS. 
My dear old German home dot stands upon de Rhine, 
Oh ! vat fond recollections you bring back to me ; 
But ven I'm old und feeble, den bring me dere to die, 
In my leedle German home across de sea. 
I 
remember yen my poor old father took me on his knee, 
lie kissed me und he told me not to cry, 
Dot de place vould soon be sold, for de soldiers dey vould come, 
Und soon after dot my parents dey did die. 
Va.h

Und dey took my dear old home away from me, 
But yen I'm dead and gone, den lay me by dere side,

MONEY. 
As sang with immense success by the only MISS NELLIE GERMON. 
What a 
blessing it is to have money, 
Always makes a 
good friend and a 
cronie; 
In a 
palace you'll dwell, there cut a 
great SWcil, 
That is if you have plenty of money. 
At office, of course, you're perfection, 
Your name bears great weight at election; 
You can have your own way, for you know you can pay 
That is if you have plenty of money. 
What a 
blessing it is to Imve money, 
Your name without Esquire, looks funny; 
The ladies all cry, and after you sigh, 
It's not for yourself, but your money. 
You'll have friends in abundance to greet you, 
It's how do you do when they meet you; 
,Just lend me a 
ten, I'll pay you again, 
But that is the last of your money. 
What a 
blessing it is to have money, 
You will not be elected a 
dummy; 
With no fear of the law, you can open your jaw. 
And laugh at the Judge, if you have money, 
if at racing or cards you've been simple, 
Drank wine till your nose is a 
pimple, 
In some Prison or Jail, no friends to go bail, 
Then you'll know what it is to have money.

We crave your condescension,

From the seventh ward below ; 
And our Captain's name was Hussey—

He carried his sword like the Russian Duke, 
Whenever he took command.

From Jackson Street 
Way up to Avenue A. 
Drums and fifes did sweetly, sweetly play, 
As we marched, marched, marChed in the Mulligan Guards 
When the band play'd Garryowen or the 
Connetnarro pet, 
With the Rub, dub, dub, we marched in the mud— 
To the military step— 
With the grfea

To show where we came front; 
Our guns we'd lilt

As we marched to the beat of the dram 
We shoul&r'd, &a 
When we'd gnt homn at night, boys, 
The divil a 
wink we'd sl. p; 
We'd all set up and drink a

Of Whisky, strong and neat. 
Then we'd all march home together 
As slippery as lard;

Arid march in the Mulligan Guard.

HEATHEN CHINAMAN. 
RECITATION. 
As given by the HAYLES in their great sketch. 
We'll tell about a 
Chinaman, 
He was born in the town of Cahoes; 
His head it was fiat, just like a 
bed- slat, 
He used to wear hi n-skin shoes. 
He had freckles all over his face, 
And warts all over his tongue, 
his nose it was hooked, his legs they were crookea, 
lie looked like a 
tramp or a 
bum, 
This heathen Chinaman. 
Ile got the croup while eating soup, 
We thought he was a 
goner; 
He got sore eyes looking at pies 
in a 
grocery around the corner. 
He had a 
face like a 
Texas steer, 
And eyes like a 
soft shell crab; 
lie had the glanders and yellow janders, 
We thought he would go mad, 
This heathen Chinaman. 
His head it was big as a 
drum, 
lie was tongue-tied in the feet; 
lie fell through a 
hall and lit on his gall, 
And landed away out in the street. 
He had a 
big wart on his ear, 
A cancer on his back; 
While shoveling fog lie was bit by a 
hog, 
We packed him home in a 
sack, 
This heathen Chinaman. 
His mouth. was twisted from eating hot biscuit, 
lie was anything but stout; 
You could hear him holler fourteen miles, 
And he never had the gout. 
When he walked the street his back would squeak, 
lie always had the blues; 
lie was long and thin like a 
piece of tin, 
He was horn in the town of Cahoes, 
This heathen Chinaman.

--: 0 :— 
I'm in love with a 
pretty little charmer, 
And Agnes is her name; 
And if she don't return the feeling, 
I'm sure I'll go insane; 
She's got the sweetest, brightest eyes, 
That ever yet was seen; 
And where I 
met this charming little pet, 
Was down by the old Mill Stream. 
Ciionus: 
Down by. the old Mill Stream, 
There many happy hours I've seen; 
Strolling day by day the time I 
pass away, 
Down by the old Mill Stream. 
She. — Last week while I 
was out a 
walking, 
I 
met a 
nice young man; 
He looked to me so very loving, 
Forget him I 
never can; 
He is good-looking, and stylish, too, 
The idol of my dream; 
I 
promised to meet him here to- night, 
And stroll by the old Mill Stream. (Chorus). 
He.—Good evening, I 
see you've kept your promise, 
And I 
now confess my love; 
If we marry, I'm sure 'tis you I'll cherish, 
I 
declare it by all above. 
She.—Indeed, you must go and ask papa, 
He.—Where does he live my Queen; 
She.—Right over yonder in that house, 
That stands by the old Mill Stream. 
(Chorus).

HUMAN NATURE. 
Sung with great success, by the immensely popular Vocal 
Comedian, HARRY MONTAGUE. 
(Music of this or of any of HARRY MONTA.GUE'S compositions, can 
can be obtained from SPEAR & DEIINHOFP1 711 Broad— 
way, N. Y.) 
Oh, here's a 
shocking sample of poor humanity, 
Now take a 
sad example from the specimen you see 
And always satisfy yourself with what belongs to yon, 
And don't go coveting another man's wife, or another man's 
darling Lou. 
SPOKEN.—Lou—Louisa—now you see 
in love with Lou, 
but I 
have no right to be, for I'm married ; but I 
always want 
what I 
ea t 
get, and I 
generally get what I 
don't want, but 
were all J.,ike, for— 
Cucaus. 
It's only human nature after all, 
I 
really cannot help myself at all 
Its only human nature, fickle human nature, 
Its only human nature after all. 
Louisa is proud and haughty, while I'm of low degree ; 
She's on the shady side of forty, while I 
am twenty-three'. 
Louisa she has heaps of cash, while I'm not worth a 
son, 
So you may guess there isn't a 
chance for a 
fellow to be loved 
by Lou. 
SPOKEN.--Yes, Louisa has got plenty of money. 
Now I 
sup-
pose that if Lou was my wife, and my wife was Lou, that I'd 
J 
21 
fall in love with my own wife; but we're both married, that irs, 
I 
am married and so is Louisa, but, unfortunately we are mar-
ried to the wrong people. 
Well— 
  ctc. 
IV wife is such a 
tartar, and she leidr4 me .. oti a 
life, 
wish that I 
could " shce " her, 
r39.y Ta-Ta to my wife, 
For an aga,Tnvaiing onr 
with such a 
temper too, 
And you e_a ..de7"ed be a 
row, if she knew that I 
loved 
Lou. 
SPOKEN.-1S 
01_ 
ity wife knew that I 
loved Lou, she:. 
los,e her temper, and Lou would lose her bad: hair, sec? for— 
It's only human, etc. 
Oh human nature fickle, it seems to be your plan 
To lead into a 
pickle every discontented man. 
You make us think we want a 
lot, that we've not had before, 
• 
And then when'eer our desires we've got, we're in trouble till 
we get some more. 
SPOREN.—Yes, it's the same all over tho world, the more we 
get the more we want, for— 
only human, etc.

HUNGRY MAN FROM HARLEM. 
Written by Harry Bennett, and sung J. D. Roome. 
Of a 
hungry man, I 
am going to sing, 
And pity to your heart will bring, 
lie swallowed almost every thing, 
This hungry man from Harlem, 
He'd eat a 
hundred times a 
day, 
his boarding bill he couldn't pay, 
he'd get out side of a 
hale of hay, 
This hungry man from Harlem, 
CHORUS. 
The way he would eat, it couldn't be beat, 
All kinds of meat, both sour and sweet, 
He'd eat every thing they had in the place, 
And bit a 
big chunk from his mother- in law's face, 
lie chewed tip his father, devoured his mother, 
lie swallowed his sister, and tackled his brother, 
lie swallowed the clock, bit a 
hole in the door, 
Chewed up the roof, and 
vallowed the floor, 
He chewed up his shoes, he chewed up his hat, 
Made a 
raid on the kitchen and swallowed the cat, 
He chewed umbrellas, and eat up the stove, 
And bit the broadside from the servants girl's nose, 
But he never had enough to eat, from hunger he was sick, 
he'd eat a 
pair of army shoes, and pulverize a 
brick, 
To see him tackel turkey would cause you to smile, 
He'd eat a 
horse and cart, and chase the driver a 
mile. 
He ate so much it made him thin, 
His hair fell out, and his clothes fell in, 
His bones was sticking through his skin, 
This hungry man from Harlem, 
lie struck this city one fine day, 
But for a 
meal he couldn't pay, 
He took a 
walk along Broadway, 
This hungry man from Harlem, 
CHORUS. 
The very first thing ne chanced to meet, 
Was a 
German band coming down the street, 
lie swallowed them all as fast as they come, 
lie chewed up their music, and ate up the drum, 
lie tackled a 
crowd coming home from a 
ball, 
They began for to dance, mid he swallowed them all, 
Went down to the ferry and swallowed a 
boat, 
Went out on election day and swallowed the vote, 
At last he came in Brooklyn town, 
lie met big a 
preacher znd gobbled him down, 
He swallowed a 
pump picked his teeth with;the handl% 
And ate the reporter of the Brooklyn scandal, 
Then getting disgusted with being so light, 
He swallowed himself and went out of sight.

DANCE ME ON YOUR KNEE. 
Sung with great success by Miss Minnie I..e4 
• 
When I 
was very young how fond I 
was of childislt joys. 
I 
loved to play among the girls, but better with the boys; 
It was pussy in the corner, tag and ineminie, 
And when my ma put me in bed I 
would steel out on the 
sly. 
I 
dared not make the slightest noise when getting back in 
bed, 
The biggest boy would boost me in my window overhead' 
I 
would go to sleep and dream I 
was a 
lady young and 
gay, 
And when my ma would take me up to her I 
used to say 
CHORUS--
Dance me on your knee, mother, dance me on your knee, 
Clasp your arms around my waist, it wont hurt me. 
Hold me tight, don't let me fall, I 
won't be afraid at all, 
Dance nte, mother, dance me on your knee.

DANCE MR 
ON YOUR KNEE.—Concluded. 
But when I 
wore long dresses first the little boys I 
shook, 
As my ideas developed the bigger ones I 
took. 
Instead of childish games it was parties, social balls and 
drives, 
Where'er I 
went I 
had my favorite escort by my side. 
But when I 
tire of one young man, another soon I 
take, 
For there's a 
way of knowing how to give the boys a 
quiet 
shake. 
And when I 
wish to call one back a 
smile would win the 
day— 
I 
need but look upon his face and coaxingly this say: 
Dance me on your knee, &c. 
I 
want to find a 
lover that will undertake the task, 
And understand just what I 
want, and never have to ask. 
If such can recommend himself I 
pray don't backward be, 
But be sure you're brave and strong enough to dance me 
on your knee. 
There's many a 
wish a 
young girl has 
express, 
There's many a 
yes. 
I 
always warn the fellows when we are sitting all alone, 
Ile sure don't rumple up my clothes, when you dance me 
on your knee. 
time we answer 
she don't like to: 
no, and heartily mean 
Dance me on your knee, &c.

No doubt you've all heard of the proud Sixty- Ninth, 
The pride of the American army, 
And you'll oft find a 
captain of that gallant corps, 
Whose danger oft-times has alarmed ye. 
Old Ireland thinks well of her brave Sixty- Ninth, 
And to Erin her men are no strangers; 
And are they not christened, in proof of my word, 
" 
The brave Sixty-Ninth Musket Rangers?" 
Cnouus. 
We are members in the gallant 
Sixty-Ninth Musket 
Rangers, 
They are the boys who have seen many dangers, 
The pride of old Ireland, men that never changes, 
,c'hout hurrah for the gallant Sixty-Ninth. 
When war's bugle calls to the front, off we march, 
And our foe we soon bring to the slaughter; 
On Indian territory, or where duty calls, 
For our country we'd shed blood like water. 
Our courage has never been daunted as yet, 
To fear, shure, our men are still strangers; 
Should foreign invaders come thither our shores, 
Then they'll hear from the bold Musket Rangers.

The Little Old House on the Rhine. 
By ALEX MCCLAFFERTY. 
Air:—" The Old Brown Cot on the Hill." 
Sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
I 
remember the days that are now past and gone, 
When a 
child how I 
once loved to play, 
By the side of the mill that stands close by the stream, 
Where for pleasure I 
often would stray. 
But now I've grown old an 
quite feeble you see, 
And so has my poor Katharine, 
But I 
sigh when I 
think of my once happy days, 
In that little old house on the Rhine. 
CHORUS. 
it was lonely and cold and in winter ' twas drear, 
For the wind would assail it at times, 
Still there's no place on earth to my memory more dear. 
Than that little old house on the Rhine. 
Now the old school house stands just the same as before 
With the church and its spires so grand, 
Where fond stories of love to each other we'd tell, 
As together we'd walk hand in hand. 
It was there where the old folks for pleasure would stay, 
And bask ' neath the old shady vine, 
How they'd watch us at play when from school we'd return, 
To that little old house on the Rhine, 
It was lonely, & c. 
They are both dead and gone and they sleep side by side, 
In the grave by the end of the vale. 
Where the birds sweetly sing on a 
bright summer's eve, 
And play in the moonlight so pale. 
Good-bye dear old home, fare you well for awhile, 
You've sheltered me many a 
time, 
Oh! I'd love to return to my old fatherland, 
And that little old house on the Rhine. 
It was lonely, &c.

THE OLD VILLAGE SCHOOL ON THE 
GREEN, 
Written by FRANK VAN HESS for ED. BURTON, and sung by him 
with great success. 
Ci. ! I 
love the bright days of my youth to review, 
And fancy again I'm a 
boy, 
With my merry companions so faithful anti true, 
And friendship that knows no alloy. 
Oh ! the thoughts I 
review as I 
ponder the past, 
Recalling each dear youthful scene ; 
The one I 
most prize, and will love to the last, 
Is the old village school on the green. 
(Repeat two last lines.) 
Near the old village school the cottage still stands, 
Where I 
first saw the dawn of light; 
And now over its porch in rich clustering bands, 
The roses are blooming as bright 
As ' twas when with garlands and wreaths of wild flowers, 
We joyously crowned our May Queen, 
And told childish love tales in neat little bowers, 
Near the old village school on the green. 
(Repeat two last lines.) 
I 
have left many dear and some loved ones behind 
To rest as I've journeyed along; 
There are others remain just as faithful and kind, 
To join in the laugh and the song; 
And when I 
am called by grim death to prepare, 
I 
will answer with spirit serene, 
i/ they'll lay me to rest when I 
breathe my last prayer, 
Near the old village school on the green.

It gets brighter still and brighter,

And I

For it drives suspense away.

Bright spark of hope, 
Shed your beams on me;

From far across the sea. 
Bright spark of hope,

And speed the loving message, 
From far across the sea. 
Hope and fear alike perplex me, 
Oh ! superstitious dread, 
How many idle fancies, 
You conjure in my head; 
When those we love are absent, 
How wantonly you play; 
Every shadow seems a 
substance, 
And drives suspense away. 
Bright spark, tic.

'Tis two short months, no more, 
Since a

Shone out as bright before; 
Then the darling messenger, 
Came prompt and safe to me;

How welcome it shall be.

Words and Music by FIELDS & LESLIE, the only Neat Jrish Dancing

In a 
distant sunny land that's far away, 
'Tis Erin's lovely isle; 
There lives the fairest maiden in the land, 
And did our hearts beguile; 
Saucy sparkling eyes of sapphire hue, 
Their glances on us fell; 
We could no longer stand their thrall, 
So my pretty Irish Queen, farewell! 
Her ways are so enticing, 
That tongue can never tell; 
One-half the love is fascination, 
So my pretty Irish Queen, farewell.

Oh, yes, I

Our hearts were aching when we sailed, 
My pretty Irish Queen, farewell. 
If you chance to roam across the sea, 
To view that Emerald land ; 
And you should chance to meet a 
lovely lass, 
So beautiful and bland; 
Do not listen to her silvery voice, 
It weaves a 
dangerous spell; 
But close your ears to her and say, 
My pretty Irish Queen, farewell. 
Her ways are so enticing, 
That tongue can never tell; 
One-half her love is fascination, 
SO

Ohl we've parted from each other, 
And our dream of love is o'er, 
That bright dream was too beautiful to last 
And we'll meet as only strangers, 
In the future evermore, 
Our once tender love is buried in trt!,, past. 
Tho' I've tried to bear the blow, 
Without sighs or bitter tears, 
And tried to smile when my heart ached with pain. 
Yet the burning tears would fall, 
In spite of all that I 
could do, 
For the darling one I

Who has claimed you for his bride, 
And you wish rue to forgive and to forget;

By the rippling of the tide, 
As I 
looked into your beauteous eyes—my pet. 
Ahi the heart is like the tides, 
That flow and ebb at will, 
I 
would not cease to love thee if I 
could; 
So, thro' all the future years, 
I'll love thee fondly, dearly, darling! 
For I 
could not cease to love thee if T 
would. 
My dream of love is o'er, &C.

THE OLD ARK'S A 
MOVING. 
Camp meeting song, original, by Mr. FRANK BENNETT. 
Away down South, where I 
was born, 
The old ark's a 
moving, a 
moving along, 
Among the sugar cane and corn, 
The old ark's a 
moving, a 
moving along; 
Then old massa promised me, 
The old ark's a 
moving, a 
moving along, 
That when he died he'd set me free, 
Oh, the old ark's a 
moving, a 
moving along. 
CHORUS. 
Then the old ark's a

Then the old ark's a

The old ark's a

When I

want to rise high, 
The old ark's a 
moving, a

Way up yonder in the sky, 
The old ark's a 
moving, a 
moving along; 
And sister Sal and my aunt Sue, 
The old ark's a

Said they'd surely be there, too, 
The oki ark's a

One summer's night ten years ago, 
The gang and brother Jim, 
Brought me down to the dock you know, 
To learn me how to swim. 
They tied a 
rope around my waist, 
And then they heaved me in, 
To tell the truth, I 
was nearly drowned, 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
CHORUS. 
Swim out says Pete, arrah kick your feet, 
Go over-hand says brother Jim, 
The gang did shout as they dragged me out, 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
Oh " chaw roast- beet, the beef is tough," 
The gang sung out to me; 
They daubed my face with lumps of tar, 
I 
looked like a 
Chinee. 
made back- dives and somersaults, 
Along with Shorty Tim; 
Both my feet were cut with copper nails, 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
(Chorita.' 
I 
was chock full of salt water, 
Brought to a 
liquor store, 
There they rolled me on a 
barrel, 
For two long hours or more. 
Sure they made me drink some brandy, 
I 
had the jim-jam-jams,

THE LIVING PHOTOGRAPHS. 
Written by J. D. KELLY, for SHERIDAN .
MACH. 
ENTER No. 1. —A VERY strange thing I've happened to see, 
That is a 
young fellow who looks just like me, 
In fact my fac-simile, dresses the same, 
I'm determined to find out who he is and hid 
name. 
I 
saw him to day out cutting a 
shine, 
With coat, pants, and vest, hat, and shoes just 
like mine, 
My senses I 
doubted, ne'er thought there could 
be, 
A 
fellow existing so much like me. 
CHORUS. 
He's so much like me, yes, he's so much like me, 
In fact, I 
never saw before such a 
fac-simile, 
It may appear quite funny, but at it I 
can't laugh, 
For it's not a 
pleasant thing to have a 
living photograph. 
ENTER No. 2.—I've seen a 
great deal as life I've passed through, 
But nothing has so much surprised the 'tis true, 
As a 
man who a 
moment ago did me pass, 
I 
thought I 
was gazing in a 
looking-glass; 
Astonished I 
stood, quite still in the street; 
We stared at each other as our eyes did meet, 
We're as much like each other as pea is to pea, 
Re dresses, looks, walks, so exactly like me. 
Re's so much like. 44,

ENTER No. 1.—Well, I 
never! 
No. 2.—Good gracious! 
No. I.—I 
vow! 
No. 2.—I declare! 
No. I.—It is quite enough to make a 
man stare. 
No. 2.—What's the ineaning of this, sir I 
you bewilder 
my brains. 
No. I.—Well, I 
really can't tell, sir, perhaps you an ex-
plain. 
No. 2.—How comes it ? 
No. 1.—Do you know ? 
No. 2.—No, really I 
don't. 
No. I.—You must change your appeartuice. 
No. 
sir, that I 
won't. 
No. 1.—You're too much like me, sir. 
No. 2.—I know, that is true. 
No. 1—But you are as much like me, sir, as I 
am like 
you. 
No. 1.-4 felt much annoyed, sir. 
No. 2.— So did I, on my word, but feel so no longer. 
Won't you take my card? 
No. I.—Well, take mine in return. 
Why, what is this 
name? 
No. 2.—John Robinson Smith, sir. 
No. I.—Why, mine is the same. 
No. 2.—Well, let us shake hands, 
Since acquaintance we've made, 
This strange similarity don't let's upbraid. 
No. 1.—I trust that each we now understand, 
So with all my heart. sir, I 
gife. you my hand. 
CHORUS. 
BOTH.—Your'e so much like me, sir, 
You're so much like me, 
In fact I 
never saw before such a 
fac-simile, 
So at this strange adventure both of us can laugh, 
To think that each of us have got a

THE LOVE-BIRD'S KISS. 
Words by L. H. F. du TERREAUX, MIlSie by GEORGES JACOB& 
As sung by JENNIE M ORGAN. 
Music to be had of W IS. A. 
POND S: 
Co., 547 Broadway. 
Price 90 eta. 
High in my window two love-birds 
Hung in their cage for a 
summer long; 
Their passion had not the relief of words, 
And they did not appear to know a 
song; 
But there they nestled upon the perch, 
Beak to beak in a 
loveable way, 
Like two young lovers just fresh from church, 
And a 
look in their eyes that seemed to say— 
CHORUS. 
Hours go by 
Let them fly 
We'll mark them with a 
kiss. 
Hours go by 
Let them fly 
The time we pass in kissing, 
The time we pass in kiSsing 
Is time we never miss. 
My bird's example spread far and wide; 
"  
There in the window they kiss'd and coo'd, 
'Till it softeia'd the hearts of folks outside, 
And quite affected the neighborhood; 
And love grew in fashion more and yet more ; 
All thro' the terrace flirtation so rag'd, 
That no one of twenty, few of two score, 
But was either just wed or else engaged. 
enwraps. 
Kiss and coo 
I 
and you 
Take our delight in this. 
Kiss and coo 
I 
and you 
To share a 
perch together, 
To share a 
perch together, 
And kiss and kiss and kics 
My aged Granny, a 
prim old dame, 
Was wholly perturb'd at their wooing war: 
What forward things, I 
am fill'd with shame, 
No birds so acted in my young days, 
Their brazen immodesty pray disown, 
And send the creatures at once to roost; 
You ought to provide them a 
chaperone, 
And see them properly introduced. 
Chorus as before. 
At last came some one to see the birds; 
Somebody came, I 
won't tell who, 
But he begg'd them of me with pleading words ; 
Ask'd for them and their mistress too: 
And some how, I 
and that foolish man, 
Tho' how it bappen'd I 
cannot swear, 
Agreed to follow the Love-bird's plan, 
And make two couples instead of a 
pair.

So he only tried to educate his feet.

Come soon (Syrn) plenty of room (Syrn)— 
Come, we'll give all a 
good fair chance, 
For I 
tell you that it runs right in the family 
For all of us to play and sing and dance. 
Now Joe is getting old and rather shakey, 
And thinks its time for him to take a 
rest; 
So he sent for me to come up here before you, 
And to fill his place, I'll:try and do our best. 
I 
know that Joe has made a 
good impression, 
And I 
only hope that I 
can do the same; 
For I 
also want to make a 
reputation 
As that will help keep up the family name.

IF WE HAD THE CHANCE AGAIN. 
Sang by NED BARRY at Theatre Cornique, N. Y. 
Air—All that Glitters is not Gold. 
In this cruel world we live in, strange things we often 
see, 
Its motto you will find is wealth, no matter wher9 
we be; 
If a 
man is rich, you'll always find he's a 
score of 
friends, 
While the poor man for his living, on his labor he 
depends; 
Can't we try and help the needy, and relieve their 
anxious pain, 
And not say, well, we'll do it if we have the chance 
again 
Now, this nation is a 
great one, at least so people say, 
But, it seems to me, and you'll agree, it's dropping 
every day; 
The Indian War you've heard of, where noble Custet 
fell, 
And in his band not one was left the story for to 
tell; 
In Spain they slaughtered our soldiers, and the news 
from the army came, 
We'd avenge the Vir,qinime and Ower, if we had 
the chance again. 
49 
IF WE HAD THE CHANCE AGAIN—CONTINUED. 
Now the Winter's been a 
hard one, for the rich as wei 
as poor, 
But better times are coming, boys, of it I 
feel quite 
sure; 
We've had trouble with our Elections, we have now, 
perhaps, done well, 
I'll speak of neither party, but wait for time to tell; 
There is one though, I 
will boast of, with a 
true and 
honest aim, 
And we'd elect old Abraham Lincoln if we had the 
chance again. 
We have often thought, in sorrow, of lives so good and 
kind, 
Who helped the weary beggar, and left his name 
behind; 
He was murdered, and his murderer stands a 
free man 
now to-day, 
And it often makes me wonder if a 
jury will take 
pay; 
You've heard of him, I'm certain, his money flowed 
like rain, 
And we'd give Jim Fiske a 
bumper, if we had the 
chance again.

As sling by Wm. SCANLAN, with great success. 
Some folks go in for whiskey, 
Some for most unpleasant dogs; 
Some fellows have a

For the most outrageous togs. 
I'm very gone on linen, yes, 
And wouldn't give a 
dollar 
For life, without a 
splendid show 
Of snow-white cuff and collar.

CHORUS. 
Captain Cuff! Captain Cuff 
You can tell me by my collar; 
Captain Cuff, Captain Cuff, 
Though I'm not worth one half dollar; 
I'm awfully stiff in style, 
My cigarette I'll puff; 
Then hi I 
hi I 
clear the way, 
Here comes Captain Cuff. 
Sometimes a 
common fellow 
Of the lower order class, 
Will dare make some rude remark, 
Or mock me when I 
pass. 
And lots of vulgar little boys, 
They know me well enough, 
And oft salute me as I 
pass, 
With what cheer, Captain Cuff. 
Captain Cuff, etc. 
With darling eyes upon me, 
Through life I 
gaily march. 
My style shall be the stiffest; 
My motto shall be starch. 
Should my cuff and collar glory, 
Be ever gone and fled, 
You'll know that Captain Cuff's gone wrong, 
And his washerwoman's dead.

Here by thy side, love, sadly I 
stand, 
Eager to feel the soft touch of your hand, 
Waiting to hear again thy sweet voice; 
Tender words breathing to make me rejoice; 
How have I 
suffered and wished I 
were dead, 
For those sad words that in anger I 
said ; 
Oh, whisper you cherish for all, no regret, 
Say you forgive me, then kiss and forget, 
CHORUS. 
Kiss and forget, love, each angry word ; 
Speak but to tell me my pleading is heard; 
Kiss and forget love, each angry word; 
Speak but to tell me my pleading is heard: 
Why should your heart be repining yet ? 
Say you forgive me, then kiss and forget. 
Why should your heart be repining yet? 
Say you forgive me, then kiss and forget. 
Smile on me, dearest, same as of old, 
Rest on my bosom thy tresses of gold ; 
Tell me in accents tender and true, 
All that my loving lips once did repeat. 
I 
have been wayward and unkind to you, 
Yet in my heart I 
have ever been true, 
Think of the past with no mournful regret, 
Say you forgive me, then kiss and forget 
Kiss and forget, &c. 
Why did we ever wander apart, 
Filling with sorrow each happy young heart, 
Love's rosy pathway should know of no tents, 
Never a 
shadow of sorrowful fears. 
Life should be joyous to you and to me, 
Fair as the sunlight that kisses the sea. 
Let us go back to the day that we met, 
Banishing all as we kiss and forget. 
Kiss and forget, 4kek

Waiting the day when I'll be his bride; 
Dearly he loves me, but never in vain, 
Soon he is coming to kiss me again. 
CHORUS. 
Kiss me again and say that you love me, 
Ever my darling remain; 
Kiss me again, and if I 
complain, 
Say that you love me and kiss me again. 
Sweet is the kiss that lovers can share, 
How it will cheer you and banish all care ; 
Never refuse one, never be shy, 
Don't be too bashful and scream out " Oh, my!" 
Kisses are plenty and kisses are sweet, 
When you take one the dose you'll repeat; 
If with your lov'd one you'd always remain, 
Come to his side and say, " kiss me again!" 
Kiss me again, etc.

RICK ME AGAIN. 
Parody oz Rims Me Again. 
Bung by Andy Collurn, 
I 
sat down one night on an old cellar door, 
Around the corner in front of a 
Dutch grocer:: start 
Thinking of home, and my clothes all in hock, 
When suddenly I 
experienced a 
terrible shock, 
The door gave away and unlucky I 
fell, 
I 
bursted my pantaloons and undergarments as well, 
I 
struck on my bead on the hard cellar floor, 
And the proprietor bounced me up through the door. 
CHORUS. 
He kicked me again in the bosom of my pants, 
Which made my stomach feel queer, 
He kicked me again and because I 
complained, 
Out on the sidewalk I 
walked on my ear. 
Kicks are a 
thing that all bummers can get, 
If they hang around saloons and cigar stores you bet 
They are always given freely and don't cost a 
cent, 
And the place that you get them are sure to be bent 
If once you get landed out into the street, 
You hardly would care the dose to repeat, 
Boot toes have nails in and makes you feel sore, 
And kdways are ready to kick you once more.

HEALTHY DARLING.

As sung by Mr. BILLY BIRCH, of SAN FRANCISCO MINSTRELS. WriIIE/3 
by ED. FRENCH. 
—:0:— 
I've got a 
healthy darling 
Who weighs 300 pounds, 
She takes the cake at a 
fat clam bake 
When she goes waltzing round; 
Her appetite is numerous, 
Her mouth is large, of course. 
She's death on clams and western hams, 
You bet she is the bogs. 
She's witty, and pretty, 
As a 
wild-cat or giraffe, 
No, never, hardly ever, 
Will you hear this darling latic.th; 
With freckled feet and voice so sweet 
As the solid rye and rock, 
She is the belle, her ears do swell 
A 
singing on cur block. 
CHORUS: 
Little Fatty Walker a-sittting in the sun, 
Crying and weeping for her young man; 
Rise, Sally, rise, wipe your eyes out with your frock. 
The pet of all the neighbors a 
liv'ng, on our block-
EALTHY DARLING.—CoNTINuED. 
No wonder she's so healthy, 
Because she's so well fed, 
She's the envy of our neighborhood 
With her great big bull frog head, 
She's handy with a 
boxing-glove, 
An oyster stew or pie, 
With a 
base-ball bat she killed a 
rat 
A " Coming thro' the Rye;" 
How alarming, yet so charming, 
Does her hair flow to the breeze, 
In the polka or mazourka 
She can do with perfect ease. 
She's my sugar plum, my rum and gum, 
As solid as a 
rock; 
My rootsey, chootsey, tootsey, wootsey, 
Singing on our block. 
(Cuottus). 
At early morn when the birds would sing 
You'll find my Sally there, 
Dancing round the sweet rose bush 
With flowers in her hair; 
The little chippies tootetoot, 
And bounce upon her ear, 
She joins them in their jolly songs 
When she is full of beer. 
She's a 
prancer, and a 
dancer, 
But on singing she'd go broke. 
She struck the key, it was high C, 
I 
thought she was going to choke. 
Her eyelids they've grown faded 
Tossinff, freckles to the moon; 
The nei ,hborhood's gone crazy 
Listening to this dizzy coon. (Chorus).

I 
WANDERED BY THE BROOKSIDE 
Music Published by FIRTH, POND & Co., 547 Broadway, New York 
I 
wandered by the brook-side, 
I 
wandered by the mill— 
I 
could not hear the brook flow, 
The noisy whee' was still. 
There was DO SOUnu of grasshopper, 
No chirp of any bird— 
nd the beating of my own heart 
Was all the sound I 
heard, 
I 
sat beneath the Elm tree, 
I 
watched the long, long shade, 
And as it grew still longer. 
I 
did not feel afraid— 
For I 
listened for a 
footfall, 
I 
listened for a 
word, 
But the beating of my own heart, 
Was all the sound I 
heard. 
Ile came not, no, he came not! 
The moon came out alone ; 
The little stars sat, one by one, 
Each on its golden throne. 
The evening wind passed by my cheek, 
The leaves above were stirred, 
But the beating of my own heart 
Was all the sound I 
heard. 
Fast, silent tears were falling, 
When something stood behind, 
A 
hand was on my shoulder, 
I 
knew the touch was kind; 
It drew me nearer, nearer, 
We could not speak a 
word, 
And the beating of own hearts 
Was all the ki.ouud we heard,

I'll Laugh! And that's Always the 
Last of It. 
Original Music by PROF. JAS. KENNEDY. 
Sung by M. 
FRANK LEWIS, at Fox's Theatre, Philadelphia. 
'TM my maxim in life to alloid care and strife, 
And to walk through this world with a 
smile; 
How I 
pity the man, who to laugh never can, 
Has no joy his sad hours to beguile. 
Let us live by the w.iy, think how short is our stay. 
Do not waste time with foolish repining, 
You wi:1 act a 
wise part if you take to your heart, 
livery bright ray of light that is shining. 
CHoutTs. 
So a 
fig for despair, I 
will drive away care, 
I 
regret not my life what is past of it; 
If sorrow draws nigh, to defeat it I'll try; 
I'll laugh I 
and that's the last of it. 
If the girl that I 
love, she should false to me prove, 
Do you think I 
would sit down and cry— 
No 1 
I 
would start out anew, other dear ones pursue, 
And to live out my trouble, would try. 
I'd keep a 
stiff upper lip ; never give up the ship, 
The sad wrinkles of woe ever scorning; 
Though dense be the shroud of a 
darkening cloud, 
'Tis dispelled by the sunlight of morning. 
So a 
fig for despair, Ito. 
Did I 
once trust a 
friend and was wronged in the end, 
Still the sweet cup of joy I 
would quaff; 
And if trouble it came, not a 
soul would I 
blame, 
But my manhood I'd rouse wi.h a 
laugh; 
Nut a 
tear would I 
shed, but be jolly instead, 
For sorrow I 
never could borrow; 
I'd with patience abide, ' till the turn of the tide, 
And the bright sun it shone on the morrow. 
So a 
fig for despair, 1,4, 
I'M WAITING FOR THEE.

Oh, Barney ! 
Afar o'er the waves, down yon bright little bay,

Courting Cards. — nis Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a 
way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything. that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the difli-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation tin. 
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would 
only encourage the had habit of " flirting."

enough of it done without any further necessity of explaining "how, 
when and where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initi-
ate the uncorrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting."

neat little 
book, bound in Morrocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt." Published by A. J. FISHER, No. 24 Vesey Street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol.

afford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recom-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."
