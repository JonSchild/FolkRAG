• vets with serious health issues (such as cancer, COPD [Chronic Obstructive 
Pulmonary Disease]) 
• vets living outside 
• vets with a family with children 
• female vets, as being more vulnerable if homeless; 
HUD VASH started in 2008 when about 800 homeless vets in ND; through 2016 have housed 
over 1,050 vets; about to declare functional zero, meaning any vet who loses his/her 
housing can secure shelter immediately and permanent housing within 90 days; USICH 
[United State Interagency Council on Homelessness] certifies whether cities/states have 
ended veteran homelessness; as of January 2017, just five vets were homeless in ND; direct 
service is key to success; 
Description of VASH; similar to Section 8 where a person pays 30% of their income for rent; 
but VASH comes with intensive case management which is a condition of receiving the 
subsidy; a case manager works with 30 clients at one time; 
Types of support are immediate basic needs; once in housing, people may have trauma 
issues, addiction issues, mental health issues to deal with; vets access the VA 
hospital/clinics; have not seen delays getting VA healthcare like in other regions; 
Barriers vets experience are similar to larger population; exception would be in Vietnam 
vets who didn't receive care for issues early on; more recent vets exhibit more traumatic 
brain injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder; 
Case managers do active outreach to shelters or wherever they think vets will be; every 
state has a veterans registry to connect with vets accessing social services; if vets decline 
HUD-VASH, case managers keep trying; offer socks, granola bars, coats, other needs in 
meantime; 
Rent Income sources of income: if they have none, they won't pay anything; other sources 
would be social security; service-connected pension; employment income; Housing First 
model helps people access housing and become stable before addressing other issues; vets 
choose where they want to live; case managers build relationships with landlords and will 
intervene of they have concerns about formerly homeless individuals as tenants; benefit to 
landlords is rent paid on time and a case manager who can mediate; a "landlord risk 
mitigation fund" provided by Supportive Services for Veterans grant reimburses landlords 
for costs incurred if there are problems; 
Affordable rent for a one-bedroom is $650; Housing shortage in western North Dakota 
during the oil boom; in Minot, Williston, Dickinson areas, median apartment was probably 
$2,000; some landlords lowered rents for veterans; 
How Brenda got into this work; social worker for 20 years; beginning at a Human Services 
Center with people with mental illness; began doing outreach to vets and in 2008 became 
first HUD-VASH case manager in North Dakota; began as a team of 3 and now a team of 20; 
she is a veteran and so is Diana; 50% of team are female veterans; 
Discussion of whether being a vet is helpful; common assumption that women aren't 
veterans; sometimes can help build rapport; 
Length of time with clients, some as long as nine years so far; caseloads are three-tiered: 
people that need immediate and intensive attention, some that have better or worse 
months, others that just need occasional check-in;

Discussion of whether her clients have family support, most do not; family provides stability 
but in these cases peer support can play that role; some have burned bridges with families, 
others may not be wise to reconnect with family; loneliness is a major issue once someone 
gets in housing; connect to other resources, volunteer opportunities, vet social club; two 
employment specialists can connect to employment; transitioning from highly structured 
military to unstructured can throw some individuals off; 
Style and strategy for starting to work with someone: build trust simply and gradually; she 
goes to where the veteran is; accepts each individual for who they are; uses motivational 
interviewing; 
Discussion of her philosophy or frame; she doesn't put people in a box in other ways in her 
life either; discussion of homeless veteran services being exempt from sequestration so 
homeless vets have more continuity; partner organizations losing funding may impact them, 
however; 
Challenges include finding affordable housing; another challenge is hurting and vulnerable 
clients; story about one veteran who impacted her; 
Advice to someone getting into this work: listen to clients and colleagues; drop 
preconceived ideas; 
Demographics: 95% of veterans served are single males; small number of females and even 
smaller number of veterans with families; Diana discusses her history with the military and 
history of women in the military; 
Brenda was Army Reserved and activated during Desert Shield Desert Storm and was 
overseas for seven months; 
Veterans housed have largely been travelers and have found North Dakota welcoming; 
Future discussion; feels people will always struggle to maintain housing, but there will be 
more supportive services in homes; efforts will be preventing future homeless; 
Examples of higher needs individuals; she does lots of risk assessments; 
• suicidal ideation 
• alcohol use 
• healthy eating and drinking 
• medical needs 
Need for outreach is diminishing with more emphasis on maintaining housing now; Diana on 
the need to replicate the model in other populations; Diana discusses Brenda starting with 
35 housing vouchers and established national best practices so that funding was provided 
for city after city until they provided statewide; just now starting a tribal HUD-VASH 
program on Turtle Mountain reservation; importance of data and numbers in serving 
people;
