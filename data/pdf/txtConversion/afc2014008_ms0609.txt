Assistant Professsor of
 
History and Folklore
 
Dear Professor Hawes,
 
Your paper at the American Folklore jociety meeting on "Happy Birthday...'!
 
was absolutely delightful as well as enlightening.  And your film and corarents
 
on MET "This 6
Jeek" were equally siLnificant.
 
Perhaps I could encourage you to participate directly in the next
 
CFS meeting.  A paper comes to mind immediately, of course, but perhaps
 
you have a suggestion for a panel discussion that you would like to be
 
involved in.  ?ersonally, I would like to h
=
,ve some payers on children's
 
folklore or perhaps a panel dealing with some a
spect of the subject, but
 
I
'll leave it up to you.  I hope you will be able to participate in the meeting.

Dear Mike:
 
I
 
Thanks very ►
ruch for sending me your papers; I
've enjoyed them greatly.
 
I stopped by UCLA the other day in pursuit of various matters but unfor-
tunately missed you.  I had wanted, among other things, to apologize for
 
not having confirmed more vigorously (
at the Fullerton business meeting)
 
the fact that you had indeed sent out a call for papers.  What I remembered
 
was that you had written me a most f
lattering note requesting a paper
 
directly; i
t wasn't until the other day when I was f
iling some thi ns
 
away that I observed that the note was written at the bottom of a formal
 
dittoed call.  You see what the personal touch can do:
 
i also wanted to congratulate you again for a most exceilent program; 1
 
do not think I have attended a meeting -- a
t l
east not in California -
-
where the papers have been of such a uniformly high calibre.  What i
s
 
your secret -
- l
aying the butter on very thick':
 
As you may have heard, I
'll be at UCLA during the seconu summer school
 
session; i
f you should be around then i
t would be p
leasant to get better
 
acquainted.
 
Cordially,
 
Bess Hawes

i
t
s you may remember, at the 1
�
anta Clara meeting various of thf! folklore
 
graduate students were discussing (
airong other complaints) their dill
,
 
econo::
,ic future: as far as ,
jobs in the
: field go.
 At that titre, Barbara
 
L
ra'an (
currently student vice-presir.
'ent of C S
, southern division)
 
mentioned to me a meeting she: had attended when she was in the: east
 
which v
ans concerned with careers in anthropology -- an equally difft 4
 
cult area to visualize getting a ,
job in, if one douse t want to po into
 
CO,l oge  t
o aching.
 
I am  enc Los ins; the brochure from this i
rceting for your interest,
 I
 
suggested to :
iachae
 l Jones Last year that a panel discussion for folk-
 
ores q
t-,dents organized along; the nres
► ie that the study of folklore
 
is actually "relevant" to various occupations might be both useful and
 
sti.nulating.
 He agreed but unfortunately I carne up with t
'
.-i
e idea too
 
late: to get it i
:anlex t
ented in time, for the Fullerton mee
.;t i
v
.;>.
 ao I
 
thought I would pass the: notion along; to you for your consic!e:ration.
 
'
ghat 1 had
. in mind was i
t panel discussion, each person participating
 
having had direct experience with tho application of folklore in fields
 
or ,
jobs other than teitchin-; folklore per se.
 It would seem to me that
 
these s
pigot include an elementary school teacher (
soine of elan :
�undes'
 
students are such), reporting and editing (Ed Cray?), some one in social
 
work and some one in medicine (have no sugpes lions here but others might).
 
I
'd also like: to suggest Barbara herself, who is involved now actively
 
in what might be r
_aliod "
community work", trying to encourage and develop
 
cultural activities and such things as festivals, diBBle contests,  local
 
fairs and the, like a
.
c
�tong the trans pianted
. Appalachians in south Los
 
Angeles.
 She: could also report on Jimmy D
iriftwood's work in Arkansas
 
along the: same: Line; his operation, strictly local to begin with, has
 
been so successful that he has promoted a iar
.po sutr
a of money frou
. the
 
poverty fund -,
x►onio to set up an Arkansas rural cultural center.
 
I don't know how you might fuel about it, but it would
 to t
r
_e that
 
this might be i
t particularly suitable panel to present at American River
 
College, where the emphasis is so heavily placed on co►:
tmi
-mity participa-
tion and where, it .
also seems to t
ne, the presentation of some: t
r
,ore
 -
sophisticated programs of "applied folklore" might be useful to the people
 
c
itt` endin�.
 .
�S  for how  to  +
m
o t'_'  mit  si mb  a  par
iF
'l --  c
'
�s9lv`
ii nf',  of  co urs e
 
and always, that you think the idea a good one -- I should think both
 
Dunde:s and
. Hector 1
4)e might have
 suggestions.
 
Anyway, it's a thought.
 1
-leas e  let; me know if you c
ra m more such and
 
i

Dear Hector:
 
I am writing in my official capacity as President to invite you t
o give the
 
banquet address a
t the 1
-
)72 meetings of the California Folklore Society at
 
American River College next spring.
 
There are a uu
i>>ber of reasons why Roland Dickison (
this year's program chairman)
 
and I l
eery much hope you will accept.  In the f
irst place, as I wrote you earlier,
 
your absence f
rom L
ast year's meeting was a real disappointment to many.  It's
 
not only that we go to meetings to see o
ld friends but to make new ones; and to
 
m
.gny newer members, you are one of those l
andmark figures they l
ook f
orward to
 
meeting personally.  In the second place, the Society seems to be making a serious
 
effort to involve more and more people in active relationship, to broaden par-
ticipation on a
1
.1 kinds of l
evels.  D.K.'s revision of the editorial board of
 
Western Folklore was undertaken in this spirit; my election was another such
 
move, i
t seems to me.  Against this sort of diffusion, with each year c
aore and
 
more new people coming t
o the meetings, i
t seems to me that a review of the
 
history of the Society and a discussion of perspectives for the future might
 
be critical j
ust at this time; ind I know of no one with the knowledge, experience
 
and wisdom you have to bring to such a topic.
 (Not, you understand, ghat I
'll]
 
telling you what to talk about -- only hoping that i
t will come out a bit this
 
way!)
 
A third reason, Hector, i
s that in all my years of association with t
he Society,
 
I
. have never heard you give an address.  In jump-rope terms, you've been sort
 
of on "everlasting turner" in your own great style, introducing and chairing in
 
your e
special affectionate spirit,  But I feel cheated that I
've never had a
 
chance to hear you say what you particularly have to say, talk in terms of your
 
own special interests -
- ;
you've olway,; talked about other people -- and I know
 
many others in the Society agree with me.  And I can't help but remark that I
 
haven't heard a J. Golden Kimball story in years and years now, and I hope you
 
will put in j
ust one f
or me.
 
I won't go on and on -
- though I could.  I realize you have many demands made
 
on you every day and every week; I just hope that your affection for the Society
 
will push us up towards the head of your l
ist.
 
With all best wishes,

Dear Bess:
 
12 May 1971
 
After all my abrasiveness at Fullerton I thought it only right and
 
courteous to set do ,,
vn for you the suggestions concerning 1972 which I
 
brayed at our recent business meeting.
 These are as follows:
 
For the 1972 meeting the Local Chairman,  the Program Chairman, and
 
their committees should be picked by May or June 1971*
 The Local
 
Chairman must initiate rooms and hotel space almost immediately so that
 
later disappointments and conflicts are avoided.
 If possible, he should
 
get a rate.
 The Program Chairman should send
. out a call for papers in
 
the Fall of 1971°
 This call should go to all of the membership.
 If
 
funds are short he could use balk mail or attempt to place his announcement
 
into Western Folklore. 
That last would have to be checked through with
 
the Editor.
 If it is at all possible, the call for papers should include
 
whatever local arrangements have been made.  Moderators and chairmen
 
should be instructed to cut off a paper that runs too long.  A tight
 
schedule is not, of course, the sine non qua of a successful meeting,
 
but it does help.
 Neither membe
s
r
o
o
 f tF
ie Program Committee nor those
 
of the Local Committee should appear on the program.
 However, it is
 
conceivable to keep one' or two in the wings to deliver a paper in place
 
of someone who unexpectedly failed to show up or to read a paper written
 
by someone absent.
 The people who are on the program should reflect
 
the distribution of the membership.
 Last month I was disturbed by the
 
emphasis placed on UCLA and former UCLA people.
 The California Folklore
 
Society should tell the Program Chairman just how much he may spend f6r
 
his mailings, telephone calls, etc.
 Then about February or March 1972
 
the printed program, including the final local arrangements should be
 
mailed out -- again to all members.
 
I do not write these suggestions to slander anyone connected with
 
our recent program.
 It was a good program, although parochial.
 The
 
fact is that UCLA puts out good people, and these good people were
 
tapped for the program at Fullerton.  But the Southern California members
 
can meet any time they want and read papers to each other
..
 What I would
 
like to see is people from all over the area served by the California
 
Folklore Society bring their contributions and feel that their contributions
 
are welcomed.
 
You have my permission, if you ;
iish q to copy this letter for the
 
Board Members, Program Chairman, Local Chairman, and others.  But theJre
.
 
are only suggestions, not complaints, and I send them to you with
 
absolute good will.
 
Sincerely,
 
Zmund Eisner
 
Professor of English
