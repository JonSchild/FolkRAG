THE VIRGINIA ROSEBUD. 
Sung with immense success by M ISS ANNIE BCF:GESS, with H &A.1.14K 
HIBERN/Ati Minstrels. 
I 
had a 
rosebud in my garden growing, 
A 
plant I 
cherished with a 
mother's care, 
And all the darkies around that plant were hoeing, 
A 
zephyr fragrance seemed to till the air. 
Olt: how I 
watched that plant while creeping, 
She, like her mother, ever fond and gay, 
One night I 
laid her on her pallet sleeping, 
And in the morning she was stole away. 
(Repeat last two line4.) 
They stole, they stole, they stolt- my

CALL ME THINE OWN. 
Sung with great sRecess by P: C. For. 
Call me thine own, name fond, endearing, 
Like music sweet it falls on mine ear, 
Tolls me of hope life's pathway cheering, 
Wilispers of home, with thee ever near. 
C.a.11 in 
thine own, doubt would destroy, 
For only thro' faith are we secure; 
Making our hearts strong to endure 
What lies before us, sorrow or joy. 
(.."all me thine own, thine, thine alone, 
Name fond endearing, 
Call me thine own. 
Years may roll on, youth's dreams may leave us, 
Hopes faint and die that lighted our way; 
Trials may come, sorrows may grieve us, 
Friends may depart, or falsely betray. 
Call me thine own, all else may fail, 
With love in our hearts, heaven still remains; 
Each bond with time fresh vigor gains, 
And o'er life's tempests love shall prevail. 
Call me thine own, thine, thine alone, 
Name most endearing, 
Call me thine own.

As sung by R. G. LITTLE 
I've a 
casket at home that is filled with precious gems; 
I 
have pictures of friends dear to me, 
And I've trinkets so rare, that came many years ago, 
From my far distant hone across the sea. 
But there's one sweet Mge treasure that I'll eves 
dearly prise, 
Better far than all the wedth bereath the wave; 
Tho' a 
small faded flow'ret, that I 
placed in child 
hood's days, 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
CHORUS. 
Treasured in my menfry like a 
happy dream, 
`Are the loving words she gave, 
And my heart fondly cleaves to the dry and wither& 
leaves--
'Tis a 
flower from my angel moc'her's grave 
in the quiet country churchyard they laid her dowr 
to sleep; 
Close beside the old home she's at rest. 
And the low, sacred mound is enshrined within my 
heart, 
By the sweet ties of love forever chest. 
In the still and silent night I 
often dream of home 
again, 
And the vision ever tells me to be brave; 
'or the last link that binds me to the place I 
love so 
well, 
Is the flower from my angel mother's grave.

As sung by ED. BURTON. 
It's sailing I 
am at the dawn of the day, 
To my brother that's over the sea, 
And it's little I 
care for my life anywhere, 
For ' tis breaking my poor heart will be ; 
But a 
treasure I 
take for old Ireland's sake, 
And I'll pledge all belonging above, 
'Tis a 
handful of turf from the land of me birth, 
From the heart of the country I 
love.

Then won't that poor lad in his exile be glad, 
When he sees the br2Lght present I 
bring ? 
And won't then the flowers in their elegant bowers 
Breathe forth the perfume of spring ? 
Oh, Etin, Maehree though it's parted we'll be, 
'Tis a 
blessing I 
leave on your shore, 
Though your mountains and streams I 
will see in my

Till I 
cross to old Ireland once more.

MARY ANN, I'LL TELL YOUR MA. 
Written and Composed by GEOFFREY Tuons. 
Sung with great success by TONY PASTOX. 
The music of this song is published by E. H. HaaniNo, 2. 
Bowirm 
New York. 
Price 10 cents. 
I 
spoon a 
girl named Mary Ann, a 
tender little dove, 
Who costs me lots of half- pence, and a 
precious deal of love; 
She's living with her mother, as a maiden ought to do, 
And looks as straight and proper as a 
saint, or me or you. 
But somehow when I 
trot her round, no matter where we go, 
I'm struck with all the people that this maiden seems to know; 
For certain as Mary Ann I 
proudly take about, 
Some heads pop round the corner, and a 
vulgar voice will shoal--
CEIOR1711. 
Oh, very well, Mary Ann, I'll tell your ma, 
She little thought when you came out you'd go so far. 
I'm sure your mother doesn't know the girl you are, 
Mary Ann, Ile! for shame, Yahl yell! yah I 
Oh! yaht 
We went last Whitsim Monday to the forest by the rail. 
We did the thing first class of course, at that I 
never fail; 
I 
tipp'd the guard a 
shilling, or what you might call a 
bob. 
To lock us in a 
carriage and preserve us from the mob. 
We sat on downy cushions and the curtains drew for fun, 
For Polly said her pretty eyes they could not bear the sun, 
But when we settled snugly and were just about to go 
A head came through the window and a fellow shouted— 
Oh, very well, ate. 
We wander'd through the forest glades as happy as could be, 
We thought from vulgar people there, we should at least be free, 
We sought a 
sweet secluded spot, where none our vows could heart 
And whisper'd those soft, silly things, that lovers think so dear. 
We sat beneath a 
spreading oak, our loving arms entwined, 
While I 
was fond and foolish, she was gentle, sweet and kind; 
But just as I 
my passion told, and sealed it with a 
kiss, 
A chap birds-nesting up above, so rudely shouted this— 
Oh, very well, eto. 
We came away disgusted, and we quickly made for home, 
For everywhere we niet the cry, no matter where we'd roam, 
aly Mary Ann declared to me she knew those people not, 
In fact, she said she would not mix with such a 
vulgar lot. 
But on this precious mystery I 
have some little doubt, 
And almost think that Mary Ann must know her way about, 
For when we parted at her door, or rathex just inside,. 
A 
voice came down the staircase, and bar little brother cried— 
SPOILZIC—Oh 
I 
oh I 
oh I 
Oh, very well, ete.

OH, FRED! TELL THEM TO STOP. 
As sung by COOL BURGESS. 
No doubt you have heard of the great fancy fair, 
That used to take place every day; 
Well, I 
thought for amusement I'd take my 
girl there 
To pass a 
dull hour away. 
We went in you must know and saw Barnum's Great 
Show, 
Van Amburgh's Menagerie as well; 
There were roundabouts, swings and all kind of 
things, 
Forget the day I 
never shall. 
SPOKEN.—Ves, when we got to the fair my girl 
wanted to have a 
ride on one of the swings. 
I said: 
"All right, my darling," and we had a 
swing; but 
directly the swing went to and fro, she lustily called 
out: 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Fred! tell them to stop! 
That was the cry of Maria; 
But the more she said whoa! they said let it go, 
And the swing went a 
little bit higher. 
The people that stood round, of course they all laughed 
But I 
only said stop the swing: 
There were -four or five others in the boats beside us, 
Saying, master, don't do sue!) 
thing. 
'Twas then that some roughs en tIght hold of the ropes, 
Maria, fell down on her knee, 
And one of them said, the young man's turning red, 
But isn't he having a 
spree. 
Oh, Fred! eta 
They soon stopped the swing and Maria got out, 
And quickly fell down on the floor; 
They brought her some water, which soon brought 
her to, 
This girl whom I 
now do adore. 
Should You ever go there to the great fancy fair, 
Friends, take advice while I 
sing, 
Of the great roundabout, it's the best fun that's out, 
And finish the day with a 
swing. 
SPotn-77:. -- Mark now, before you get into the 
swin ,'s boat. make a 
bargain with your young lady

Oh, Fred!

Sung with great success by P. '. Foy, Irish Ter...h. 
Oh, Erin, tar eountry, although thy harp sit/inhere, 
And li S in oblivion near Tara's old ball, 
With scarce one kind hand to enliven its numbers. 
Or strike the rode dirge to the sous of Fingall. 
Then Erin, my country, I 
love thy green bowers, 
No music to me like thy murmuring. rills ; 
And the shamrock to me is the fairest of flowers, 
And naught is more dear than thy daisy- clad hills. 
Cnonus. 
Then hail fairest island of Neptune's old ocean, 
The land of St. Patrick, my parents agra; 
Cold, cold must the heart be, and void of emotion, 
That loves not the nauie of Erin go Bragh. 
Then where is the nation Pan rival old Erin 
Or where is the country such heroes can boast ? 
'h i battle they a 
r brave as the lion or tiger, 
And swift as the eagle that flies around our coast. 
The breeze often shakes both the rose and tha 
While Erin's green shamrock lies hushed in the dell; 
Securely it stands while the stormy winds whistle, 
And lies undi,tarbed in the moss of the vale. 
Then hail, etc.

like honest pluck in this w

No matter whoever I

I 
like a

The truth plainly told in your ear ; 
Yet ' tis better to know you're prepar'd for the wors%

do like a

And tell me at once what he feels, 
I 
can fight with the lion that roars in my face, 
But I 
can't bear a

I 
like to be told of my faults like a

And I 
ne'er knew the man who had none ; 
Hard words may be used, yet I 
like him the most. 
Who has pluck all my faults to make known. 
If wrong I

Yet I 
reel when a

And your good name %yin spread like a

A

And if you have cause of complaint igainst man, 
Go tell him right straight to his face.

YOU WOULD NOT LEAVE YOUR NORAIL 
Wrttten and sung with great success by P C. For, Irish Tour,. 
Sure you would not leo-ve your Noraii, 
To pine alone behind. 
With the wide, wide world before her 
And no one to be kind. 
The times are hard and trying, 
But Dennis, dear, they'll mend. 
And never mind my sighing, 
e 
yet may find a 
friend. 
CuorrTs. 
So do not leave your Norah, 
To pine alone behind, 
With the wide; wide world before bar 
And no one to be kind. 
'Yes, Norah, dear, I 
am going, 
,kud yet it breaks my heart. 
To see your eyes o'erfiowing, 
With tears because we part. 
'Tis sad to leave old Erin, 
A 
stranger's home to share, 
But sadder far, I 
am fearing, 
With none to love me there. 
I 
grieve to leaver sift 
Then Dennis, take me, with you, 
I 
have saved a 
pound or two; 
There's is no one to forbid you, 
You know not what I'll do. 
I 
will soothe your evezy sorrow, 
But first the priest I'll tell 
We will married be to-morrow, 
Then Erin, fare thee well. 
And I 
will not leave, et*. 
Allt.—Death of Nelson. 
Written for P. C. Foy, by WM: CARLETON, 
RECITATIVE. 
O'ER Emmett's tomb with silent grief oppressed, 
Hibernia mourns her hero now at rest, 
But Ireland's harp despite its slumb'ring years, 
Breathes Emmett's name, and shares Ilibernia's team. 
In Ireland's bitter plight, a 
hero in his might, 
Rose up for freedom then, 
Being no pampered fool, he scorned the British rule, 
For true born Irishmen. 
Our Emmett tried hisiand to save, 
His 1,fe in freedom's cause he gave, 
For duty only carin'! he gave his life to Erie— 
Throughout the world his summons ran, 
Ireland expects that every man, 
That loves will fight for Erin. 
That loves will fight for Edit. 
Curs treason found a 
way to blight the light of day, 
Our Emmett was betrayed, 
And Erin's cause was lost, oar hero's plans were cross'd 
By an Irish renegade. 
While Emmett's soul was void of gloom, 
A 
hireling judge pronounced his doom, 
And hang, said he, for Erin, 
Brave Emmett died for Erin. 
At last the fatal day which saw his hope decay, 
Brought death and gloom to Ireland's hero's breast ; 
4* 
Our cause is still alive, pray ticavcn it may thrive, 
die, but it will live. 
Let Lo man wri:e my epitaph until its leading paragraph 
Is lib2rty fur Erin, blest liberty for Erin. 
And when her day t 
f 
freedom dawns, 
Death, death to all the foreign spawns, 
That trample on poor Elia, 
That trample on poor Erin"

KITTY MULDOON. 
By P. J. Fox, 
May the heavens shine down on ye, Kitty Muldoon, 
With yer bright latighin' eyes, so bewitchinly blue; 
Dut take care that ye don't be the death of me soon, 
If ye taze me much longer the way that ye do. 
fly heart's daily g,rowin' inure hopeless an' sore, 
An' there's no use in goin' to bed any more; 
}or I'm all the time thinkin' about ye like mad, 
An' I 
sit at the window an' gaze at the moon; 
An' unless ye do somethin' to cure me, bedad, 
Ye will soon be the death of me, Kitty Muldoon. 
My own darlin' Kitty, my golden-haired Kitty, 
My beautiful, dutiful Kitty Muldoon. 
Last Sat hurdav night, comin' home from the store, 
I 
fell in a 
doidhrum an' wandher'd asthray; 
Till a 
feel in' came o'er me while passin' yer door, 
That tould me how far I 
was out of my way. 
Says I. " Itts a 
pity for me to come here, 
If I 
can't see my Kitty, an' Kitty so near." 
So I 
peeped through the shutters and what did I 
see 
But a 
chap they %di Barney O'Dowd from Rath-
coon, 
An' a 
charmin' young girl on his impudent knee, 
Who was just the born piethur of Kitty Muldoon! 
My own darlin' Kitty, my golden- haired Kitty, 
My beautiful, dutiful Kitty Muldoon. 
The ev'nin' we sat in the kitchen last week, 
I 
was just goin' to ask ye to tell me my fate; 
But my heart was so full that my tongue wouldn't 
speak, 
So I 
had to suppress my intentions an' wait; 
An' 11)1V I 
am mopin' in grief an' disthress, 
But I'm all the time hopin' ye'll one day say " Yea." 
An', begorra, if iver ye dared to say " No." 
It's on thrial for murdher ye'd fund 3-erself soon, 
For a 
ton weight of lead wouldn't lay me so low 
As an answer like that from my Kitty Muldoon. 
My own da din' Kitty, my golden- haired Kitty, 
My beautiful, dutiful Kitty Muldoon, 
Oh, Kitty, sweet Kitty, take pity on Tim, 
An' beware of O'Dowd with his blarney an' fun; 
Ye know how I'm filled up with love to the brim, 
An' we ought to get welded at once into one. 
When Father McSherry, our Soggarth Amon, 
Says, " Tim, will ye marry Miss Kitty Muldoon?" 
Bow quickly I'll answer, " Begorra, I 
will!" 
AB' I 
hope that his rey'rence will ask me this sooln. 
For my hart will riot let rn-_. be aisy until 
You are Kitty McCarthy instead of Muldoon; 
My own darlin' Kitty, my golden-haired Kitty, 
My beautiful, dutiful Kitty Muldoon.

ARE YOU GOING TO THE MAT THIS ARN'i 
As sung by the great and only CHARLEY KONOLLMAN

There is a 
great sensation, about a 
word you hear 
nowadays, 
The boys and girls all use it, it's about going to the 
Matinees; 
You can hear them say to each () the", when they are 
going past, 
It's either Charles or Emma, " Are you going to the 
mat this air?" 
CHortus. 
" 
Are you going to the mat this aff?" "Not this aft, 
some other aff," 
" 
Are you going to the mat this tiff?" " sot this aff;" 
" 
Then good-alt." 
" 
Are you going to the mat this aff?" " Not this aff, 
some other tiff," 
" 
Are you going to the mat this aff?" " Not this aff;" 
`Then good- all." 
By chance I 
met a 
lady friend, I 
knew for many a 
day, 
I 
went with her a 
walking, and I 
left her on Broad-
way, 
And the time that we were parting, she winked at 
me and laughed, 
And then said " Good-morning, Harry, are you going 
to the mat this aff?" 
" 
Are you going to the mat, etc. 
When boys are kissing pretty girls, they don't • know 
what to say, 
They commence to give them earaches, of new things 
out to day; 
She'll say, " Don't waist your breath talking, we've 
heard the best and last— 
The latest of the season is, " Are you going to the 
mat this aff?" 
Are you going to the mat, eta.

"

dies to-day," said the heartless judge, 
Whilst lie sat him down to the feast, 
And a 
smile was upon his ashy lip 
As he uttered a 
ribald jest ; 
For a 
demon d‘velt where his heart should be, 
lived upon blood and sin, 
Ana oft as that vile judge gave him food 
The demon throbbed within. 
" 
He dies to-day," said the goaler grim, 
Whilst a 
tear was in his eye; 
" 
But why should I 
feel so grieved for him 
Sure, l've seen many die! 
Last night I went to his stony cell, 
-With the scanty prison fare— 
He was sitting- at a 
table rude, 
Plaiting a 
lock of hair! 
And he look'd so mild, with his pale, pale face, 
And he spoke in so kind a 
way, 
That my old breast heav'd with a 
smothering feel, 
And I 
knew not what to say!" 
" 
He dies to- day," thought a 
fair, sweet girl— 
She lacked the life to speak. 
For sorrow had almost frozen her blood, 
And white were her lip and cheek— 
Despair had drank up her last wild tear, 
And her brow was damp and chill, 
And they oft;,0 feh at her heart with fear, 
For it' ; ebb was all but still.

How justly alarmed is each Dublin cit, 
That he'll soon be transformed to a 
clown, sir! 
By- a 
magical move of that conjurer, Pitt, 
The country is coining to town, sir! 
Give Pitt, and Dundas, and Jenky a 
glass, 
ho'd ride on John Bull, and make Paddy an ass. 
Thro‘ Cape! Street soon as you'll rurally range, 
You'll searce recognize it the same street; 
Choiee turnips shall grow in your Royal E\chaug,.. 
Fine cabbages down along Dame Street. 
Give Pitt, etc, 
Wild oats in the College ‘von't want to be till'd; 
And hemp in the Four- Courts may thrive, sir! 
Your markets again shall with muttons be till'd--
By St. Patrick, they'll graze there alive, sir! 
(nye Pitt, ' re. 
In the Parliament House, quite alive, shall there be 
All the vermin the island e'er gathers: 
Ptill of rooks, as before. Oaly's club-house you'll see, 
But the pigeons won't have any feathers. 
Give Pitt, etc. 
Our Custom House quay, full of Nyeeds, oh, rare sport, 
But the ministers' minions, kind elves, sir! 
Will give us free leave all our goods to export, 
When we've got none at home for ourselves, sir! 
Give Pitt, etc. 
Says an alderman—" Corn will grow in your shops; 
This Union must work pan enslavement." 
"Chat's true," says the sheriff, '' for plenty of crop., 
Already I've seen on the pavement." 
Ye brave loyal yeomen, dressed gaily in red, 
This minister's plan must elate us; 
And well may John Bull, when he's robbed us of 
bread, 
(it'll poor Ireland " The kind of Potatoes."

THE SONG ROSE OF IRELAND. 
There's not in all nature so witching a 
creature 
For singing one's sowl up as Rosh in na nan ;* • 
And the heart that can hear her and not wish to 
cheer her, 
has no right to bate in the breast of a 
man. 
When to her I 
listen, and st e 
her eyes glisten, 
Time longer I 
listen 1 
still long for more; 
For if I 
was lying half senseless and dying, 
And Roshin was singing, l'd mutter " encore!" 
"When she sings of that maiden with gems and gold 
laden. 
Whose smile in good Brian's days made her secure, 
The song- woven ,plendor, proud, brilliant and tender, 
Is richPr and mier than dreamt of by Moore. 
And, then, when the story of Turns lost glory, 
Its harp and its spirit both silent she sings, 
We hear, all delighted xvhile wildly excited, 
Her voice and her fingers both snapping the strings. 
in Spanish she's laughing. in French gaily chatting, 
In ( ferman deep musing on myst'ry or sin; 
But it's Irish that brings out the bright stream that 
springs out

THE MONARCH THAT DIED OF TB N 
DEMUTH. 
stiu;.- by cnoioN and 
A. 
Oh, one night I 
lay dreaming, itsleep in my bed, 
Wh.en a 
tale -of Sam Lover's came into my head, 
About a 
king and a 
castle, old Ireland's joys, 
On the banks of the Shannon near Clon McAnoise; 
Some parts stuck together like mortar and brick, 
Delaying the hands of old Tint e 
and old Nick: 
Like other historians I'll stick to the truth 
Arid 
i4iicr
r, of the monarch that died of the &mull. 
The name of the monarch NV; S 
Moore, 
he'd sport with Ihe rich and be friend or the poor; 
For drinking and sporting he'd 
bravo dangers and 
perils, 
And a 
rale divii's clip was he after the girls. 
ite'd astonish the neighbors whenc'er he would dance, 
.Though he never took lessons from 
London or 
Prance: 
Ili- prayed he might die the same death in his youth, 
If he'd ever let any poor divil die with hunger or 
drouth. 
One night the king came home as drunk as Kishogue— 
The stretchers in those days weren't in vogue; 
A poor begging bouchal on the road he o'ertook, 
Who asked the king for assistance because he was 
stook. 
His majesty swore an unmerciful oath 
That he couldn't buy buttons for a 
fairy's waistcoat.; 
The beggar-man prayed and cursed under his • tooth, 
Ah, I 
mu dying of hunger, may you die with the 
(frond'.

HOME RULE. 
As sung by JGENNY ROACH, 
COmposed by ... Lee: I.E.e•leei. 
It's many years ago in Ireland, you must know. 
Since happiness looked down on our land. 
Our sons they then were free and the star of liberty, 
Shone gloriously on every Irishman. 
But let us bar the door on the days that are no more, 
There's a 
light a-beaming on us from afar, 
If you listen unto me, I 
will tell you, do you 
The sentiment s 
of Pat of Mulinger. 
CHORUS. 
illirrulL for Erin's Isle, though her sons you can beguile, 
Because they know the wolf is at the door. 
Yet may our flag be seen aloft in College Green. 
And a 
Iloine Rule in Ireland evermore. 
lit England they may boast that our Parliament is lost, 
And say that we ever should complain; 
Would you have my heart be light when I know for 
this very right 
My countryman are wishing o'er the main. 
Gladstone he may rave, but our country for to save, 
These words they should be heard from shore to shore 
For O'Connell he did say, before he passed away. 
A home Rnle for Ireland for evermore.. 
There's one now in his grave who struggled hard to snve 
Our county from oppri...ssion long ago; 
Henry Grattan is his name and nay Heaven be his gain,4 
His energy on Ireland did bestow 
His voice he never .eeve our people to enslave, 
Nor drive them to a. far and distant shore, 
May the flowerlets ever wave upon our hero's grave, 
And a 
Home Rule in Ireland for evermore. 
There's a 
laurel for the brow of the one who's striving 
now 
To win cur Legislator back again, 
John Mart;re ever bold, our misery to unfold, 
And Ireland for the Irish will maintain. 
But let us nil unite to drink this toast to-night, 
May happiness revisit Erin's shore, 
And the plan of Isaac Butts, from the palace to the 
Inns, 
Be a 
lion • reie for Ireland for evermore. 
MY HEART'S IN OLD IRELAND 
AIR—Rock Me to Sleep, 31-other. 
\ 
Exiled from Erin, I 
left her fair shore, • 
Sadly and lonely I 
roamed the world o'er,. 
e 
All that was dear to me in my loved home, 
Memory brines back as daily I 
roam, 
Friends in strange countries I 
of times have met, 
Who, knowing my sorrows, would have me forget. 
- 
Or bidding me hope, for the dawning was nigh, 
When my brave brethren would sound the war-cry. 
CHORUS. 
Erin, dear Erin, I 
long for the day, 
Alt hen thy brave sons cast their bondage away. 
But should I 
never that happy day see, 
My heart's still in Ireland, where'er I 
may be. 
Years have gone by since thy fetters were wrought, 
Prayers and entreaties were counted as nought ; 
Helpless thou knelt before England in dust, 
Hoping the tyrant at least might be just. 
Vain were thy pleadings, and useless thy tears. 
England has answered with scoffs and with jeers. 
Then sad indignation each bosom did fill, 
And in deep humility bowed to God's will. 
Erin, dear Erin, efro. 
England, thou pitiless tyrant, take heed, 
Nations before us found friends in their need, 
Know, that oppression engenders deep hate, 
Deal with us justly before ' tis too late ; 
Ireland's aroused, and her '
SODS are awake, 
Soon to its centre thy kingdom shall shake— 
My country forever, in fetters or free, 
My heart is still with her where'er I 
may be. 
Erin, dear Erin, etc, 
One night of late 1 
chanced to stray, 
When all the ( ireen iii sluinber 
The Moon sunk in the deep; 
I 
sat upon a 
ruined mound, 
And while the wild Nvind whistled round, 
I.uII'd me fast asleep. 
I 
dreamt I 
saw that hero true, 
Who did the Danish force subdue; 
His sabre bright, with wrath he drew, 
These words he said to me: 
The _Harp, with rapture, yet shall sound, 
My children's chains shall be unbound, 
And they shall gather safe around 
The bloouting laurel tree." 
I 
thought brave SarsfieId drew up nigh, 
And to my question made reply; 
" 
For Erin's cause 
live and die 
As thousands did before. 
My sword again on A 
tighrim's Wain 
Old Erin's rights shall %yell maintabi, 
'Through millions ill the battle slain 
And thousands in their gore." 
I. thought Saha' Ruth stood on the ground/ 
And said, " 1 1 
he your monarch crowned, 
Encoin;,assed by the French around 
to The field :** 
He ntised at ' ros ,. 
and thus ( lid say, 
"Brave boys, w:r!'11 show, them gallant play; 
Let 111) man dare disgTace the ( I:1y, 
We'll die before we yield." 
The brave 0'13yrnt. he wa, there, 
From Jcial:ymanus, 'origin and fair, 
Brought Wicklow, Carlow, and Kildare, 
To mareit at his command : 
(Colttinett(i.) 
Westmeat-li and Cavan too did join, 
The could y 
Louth men crossed the Boyne, 
Slane, Trim, and Nava it too did join 
With Dublin to a 
man. 
O'Reilly, on the 11111 of ;-lereette, 
He drew his sword both bright and keen, 
And swore by all his eyes had seen, 
fie would avenge the fall 
Of Erin's sons and daughters brave, 
Who in,bly filled a 
martyr's grave, 
And die, rather than live a 
slave, 
And still for vengeance call. 
Then Father Murphy came to say, 
" 
Behold, my lord, l'm here to-day, 
With eighteen thousand pikemen gay, 
Prom Wexford's: hills and caves: 
Our country's fate, it sure depends 
On us, and on our gallant friends. 
And heaven will their cause defend, 
Who ne'er were willing slaves." 
I 
thought the band played •' Patrick's Day," 
To marshal all in grand array: 
With cap and feather, white and gay 
They marched in warlike glow, 
With drums and trumpets loud and shrill, 
And cannon upon every hill, 
And pikemen, who, with valor thrill 
To strike the fatal blow. 
When all at once appeared in sight 
An army clad in armor bright, 
Both front, and rear, and left, and right, 
Marched Paddies evermore.

Co eluded.) 
The chieftains piteind their e:naps with skill --
Determined tyrants' blood to spill, 
Beneath its ran a 
mountain_ rill, 
As rapid as the Nore. 
A Frenchman, brave, rose up and sail 
" 
Let Erin's sons be not dismayed. 
To glory I'll the vanguard lead, 
To honor and renown. 
Come. bravely draw your swords with me, 
And let each tyrant bigot see 
Dear Erin's daughters must be free 
Before the sun goes down." 
Along the line they raised a 
shout, 
Crying, " Quick march, right about:" 
With bayonets fixed they all marched out 
To face the deadly foe. 
The enemy were noways shy 
With thundering cannon planted nigh; 
.Now thousands in death struggle lie, 
And streams of crimson flow. 
The enemy made such a 
square 
As drove our calvary to despair 
Who were nigh routed, rank and rear, 
But yet not forced to yield. 
The Wexford boys that ne'er were slack, 
Came, with the brave Tips at their back, 
With Longford joined, who in a 
crack 
Soon sent them off the field. 
They gave three cheers for liberty, 
As the enemy all broken flee; 
I 
looked around, but could not see 
One foeman on the plain, 
Except the men who wounded lay: 
When I 
awoke 'twas break of day— 
So ends MacKenna's dream.

HARDING, 229 Bowery, N. Y. 
With deep affection and recollection, 
I 
often think of those Shandon Bells, 
Whose sounds so wild would in days of childhood 
Fling round ray cradle their magic- spell; 
On this I 
ponder, where'er I 
wander, 
And then grow fondt-r, sweet Cork of thee; 
With thy bells of Shandon sound far more grand on 
The pleasant waters of the river Lee. 
I've heard bells chiming full many a 
clime in, 
Tolling sublime in cathedral shrine ; 
While at h 
glibe rate brass tongues would vibrate, 
But all their music spoke naught 1ike thine ; 
For mem'ry dwelling, on each proud swelling 
Of thy belfry, knelling its bcAd notes free, 
Made the bells of Shandon sound far more grand on 
The pleasant waters of the river Lee. 
I've heard bells tolling, " Old Adrain's mole" in, 
Their thunders rolling from the Vatican, 
With cymbals glorious, swinging uproarious, 
In the gorgeous turrets of Notre Dame ; 
But thy sounds more sweeter than the dome of Peter 
Flings o'er the Tiber, pealing solemnly. 
Oh! the bells of Shandon sound ffir more grand on 
The pleasant waters of the river Lee.

And loud in air calls men to prayer

'Tis the bells of Shandon that sound so g-rand on

THE PENTANS' 
ESCAPE. 
An original song of the escape of the Fenians' from Austratia, 
as written and sung by the great Irish Comedian and Vodist. 
TAMES O'NEIL. 
Now, boys, if you will listen to the story I'll relate, 
Fil tell you of the noble men, who from the foe es-
caped, 
Though bound with Saxon fetters, in the dark Austrail-
Liu jail, 
They struck a 
blow for freedom, and for Yankee land 
set sail. 
On the 17th of April last, the stars and stripes did fly, 
On board the bark " Catalpa," waving proudly to the 
sli 
She showed the green above the red, as she did calmly 
lay, 
Prepared to take the Fenian boys in safety o'er tha 
sea. 
When Breslin and brave Desmond, brought the prison-
ers to the shore, 
They gave one shout for freedom, soon to bless them 
evermore, 
And manned by gallant hearts they pulled towards the 
Yankee flag, 
For well they knew frem its proud folds, no tyrant 
could them drag. 
They have nearly reached in safety the " Catalpa" taut 
and trim, 
When fast approaching them they saw a vision dark 
and dim. 
It was the steamer " Georgette," and on her deck there 
stood. 
One hundred haled assassins to shed eae-h patriot's 
blood.

By CHARLEs J. 
R ICKHAM. 
My name is Patrick Sheehan, 
My years are thirty-four,' 
Tipperary is my native place, 
Not far front Galtymore; 
I 
came of honest parents— 
But now they're lying low— 
And many a 
pleasant day I 
spent 
in the Glen of Aherlow. 
My father died, I 
closed his eyes 
otet.i.fie our cabin- door— 
The landlord and the sheriff too 
Were there the day before— 
And then my loving mother, 
And sisters three also, 
Were forced to go with broken hearts 
From the Glen of Alterlow. 
For three long months, in search of work, 
I 
wandered far and near; 
I 
went then to the poor-house 
For to see my mother dear; 
The news I 
heard nigh broke my heart, 
But still, in all my woe, 
I 
blessed the friends who made their graves 
In the Glen of Aherlow. 
Bereft of home, and kith, and kin— 
With plenty all around— 
] 
starved within my cabin, 
And slept upon the ground; 
But cruel as my lot was, 
I 
ne'er did hardship know, 
Till I 
joined the English Army, 
Far away front Aherlow. 
"Rise up there, - says the Corporal, 
" 
You lazy 1-liriz,th hound; 
Why don't you hear, you sleepy dog, 
The call • to arms' sound?" 
PATRICK SR EEHAN. 
(cm/d/t(ied.) 
Alas, I 
had been dreaming 
Of days long, long ago, 
I 
woke before Sebastopol. 
And not in Aherlow. 
I 
groped to find my musket— 
How dark I. thought. the night. 
0 blessed God, it was not dark, 
it WaS the broad daylight! 
And when I 
found that I 
was blind, 
My tears began to how, 
I 
longed for even a 
pauper's grave 
lu the Glen or Aheriow. 
0 
blessed Virgin Mary, 
Mine is a 
mournful tale. 
A poor blind prisoner here I 
am, 
In Dublin's dreary jail: 
Struck blind within the trenches, 
Where I 
n 
ever feared the foe; 
And now I'll never see again 
Mv own sweet A 
herlow! 
A poor neglected mendicant 
I 
wandered through the street, 
My nine months' pension being Gut, 
I 
beg from ad I 
meet: 
As I 
joined my country's tyrants, 
My face I'll never show 
Among the kind old neighbors, 
In the Glen of Aherlow. 
Then Irish youtits--dear countrymen— 
Take heed of what I 
say, 
For if you join the English ranks 
You'll surely rue the day; 
And whenever you are tempted 
A 
soldiering to go, 
Remember poor blind Sheehan 
Of the Glen of Aherlow.

ARTI1 CR M'COT. 
(Concluded.) 
And this faith in good works he attested, 
When Tone linked the true hearts and brave, 
Every billow of danger he breasted— 
His sword-flash, the crest of its wave; 
A standard he captured in Gorey; 
A sword-cut and ball through the thigh, 
Were among the mementoes of glory 
Recorded of Arthur M'Coy. 
Long the guest of the law and its beagles, 
His covert the cave and the tree; 
Though his home was the home of the eagles; 
his soul was the soul of the free. 
No toil, no defeat could enslave it. 
Nor franchise, nor " Amnesty Bill "— 
No lord, but the Maker who give it, 
Could curb the strong pride of his will. 
With the gloom of that ever laden— 
Seldom seen at the hurling or dance, 
Where, through blushes, the eye of the maiden 
Looks out for her lover's advance; 
And whenever he stood to behold it, 
A curl of the lip or a 
sigh, 
Was the silent reproach that unfolded 
The feelings of Arthur INIVoy. 
For it told him of freedom o'ershaded— 
That the iron had entered their veins— 
When beauty bears manhood degraded, 
And manhood's contented in chains. 
Yet he loved that fair race as a 
martyr, 
his bosom had bled for them all. 
And he died for his love—I 
remember, 
On a 
mound by the Shannon's blue wave, 
On a 
dark snowy eve of December, 
I 
knelt at the patriot's grave. 
The aged were all heavy-hearted— 
No cheek in the grave-yard was dry: 
The sun of our hills had departed— . 
God rest you, old Arthur M'Coy.

GREAT MEN THAT IRELAND HAS SEEN.

Now since I 
appear here, before you once more, 
I'll endeavor to gain your fair smile,

Whose deeds- of renown, shall shine round each heart,
