BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 
OF 
J. M. JOHNSON & S. C. SWAIN. 
It is a 
matter of conjecture when and where Mr. John-
son was born; he could not have fallen off a 
Christmas 
tree, because Christmas trees were not known in that 
time. 
Sonic people assert he is a 
Swiss Frenchman from 
Terre Haute, Indiana, while others are confident that he 
is a 
native of the sheet of water known as Lake Superior. 
But there is no direct proof of his ever having been born' 
at all. 
Sullice it to say, however, that he is here, and will 
probably remain with us until he travels elsewhere. 
Mr. 
Julia on has traveled a 
great deal in his time; has been all 
through Harlem and Hoboken, and is now contemplating a 
trip to Hackensack. 
When but a 
little boy attention was 
attracted to the extraordinary power of his voice, and his 
father, fully understanding the necessity of cultivating this 
gift, obtained for him the position of dinner bell in a 
deaf 
and dumb asylum, but genius will assert itself, and in less

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH— 
CONTINUED. 
than three years his voice became so powerful that he was 
offered the position of fog horn on a 
raft, at the enormous 
salary of twenty-seven cents per week and chew hard tack. 
After serving about two years on this railroad, sand-paper_ 
ing doughnuts and eating only every other day, he desert-
ed the vessel at the port of Cincinnati and succeeded in 
getting employment as a fender on a horse car. 
The 
conductor, however, taking him for a 
slip punched him 
full of holes and he was forced to apply for a 
situation as 
a 
sieve in a 
coal yard. 
While engaged one day in sifting 
coal through himself, his face became blackened by the 
dust therefrom, which impressed him with the notion that 
he would make a 
good negro minstrel. 
Acting on this 
idea, he left the coal business, and came to New York by 
rail, getting off the track whenever the cars came by ar_ 
riving in town just in time to be engaged with Forepaugh's 
circus, to wipe sweat off the fat woman; the weather got 
cool and he lost the situation. 
He was next employed as 
a 
ramrod for a cannon in the beautiful spectacular piece 
entitled " The Frozen Feet, or The Busted Overshoe," in 
which capacity he remained during one scene, the cannon 
proving a 
worse kicker than himself. 
Mr. Johnson is 
also well known as the author of several popular ballads 
among which may be mentioned " Take this Bald Wig to 
my Brother," "Feed the Kittens," " Mother's Drunk," 
" 
Papa's Hair is Growing Mouldy." 
Mr. Johnson is the 
most talented eater in America. 
Mr. Swain was born in the county of Tra-la-la-le, Italy, 
just two years previous to the date of his birth, his moth-
er being present on the occasion. 
His life has been an 
eventful one, and after what he has passed through we are 
satisfied that nothing short of an earthquake will kill him,

BIOGRAPWCAL SKETCH—CON TIN um 
When about seven weeks old he was apprenticed to a 
far-
mer who used him for a churn handle, which accounts for 
his creamy complexion. 
After serving three minutes 
under this master, he ran away and made a 
living during 
the next two years by counting oats in a livery stable. 
his ambition, however, would not permit him to pursue 
• 
so quiet a 
vocation. 
He next turned his attention to boat-
ing and for a 
considerable length of periods he gained a 
livelihood as a 
rudder for a 
ferry boat. 
This proving det-
rimental to his health he went to the Isle of Madeira, and 
succeeded, after many struggles in obtaining a 
situation as 
a 
cork box with a 
Portugese combination known as the 
Tourists. 
After the required term* left that company, 
and doubled up with Mr. Johnson's umbrella, knowing 
he could shut that up when he wanted to. 
Their success 
has enabled them to buy an interest in the Morgue, where 
they are now lying on ice, waiting for identification. 
Mr. 
Swain is the author of the following beautiful stanza: 
" 
My brother lies sick in the Hospital, 
And he is a 
sight to behold; 
Give, oh give me some silver, 
If you can't give silver, give gold." 
Mr. Swain carries the hatchet for truthfulness. 
Man-
agers please write immediately to New York Morgue as 
we are nearly frozen. 
Yours, truly, 
J. M. JOHNSON et. S. C. SWAIN.

I 
came to-night to see my girl, 
Oh, she is such a 
sweet dove; 
Her wool is straight, her lips do curl, 
Sue Sanders is this coon's love. 
Her form is like a 
cask of ale, 
Such a 
beauty is this dear dove; 
She weighs a 
ton, she's very pale, 
She's all mine, she's my own love. 
Clionus: 
Oh, this daisy is my own love, 
A 
sweet dove, a 
sweet love; 
There's no wench like this coon's love, 
Site's the girl I 
came to see. 
Come before it is too late, 
To the ball we both will go, love; 
Our style will make excitement great, 
We'll take the cake when there, love. 
Oh, won't we have a 
jolly time, 
You bet we'll have some fun, love; 
We darkies there will cut a 
shine, 
We beat them all on style, love. 
Cuoires: 
We'll cut the pi!!:eon wing, love, 
-We'll sing love, we'll swing, love. 
When the darkies see us there, love 
There will be music in the air.

Behold these old time heroes, 
With hair as white as snow; 
We fit with Hickory Jackson, 
In Louisiana, low, low, low. 
We waited on the generals, 
And kept the powder dry; 
And stayed way back dar in the rear, 
We did not care to die, die. 
Clare de track, please stand back, 
The old vets mighty glad; 
Dress yourself in bran new clothes, 
And bring along your dad, dad, dad. 
Hoist your umbrella's high. 
The wind ain't gwine to blow; 
flush your mouths when old folks talk 
Of eighty years ago. 
Dare was de British general, 
Oh, didn't we give him beans; 
When we lay behind cotton-bales, 
Down at New Orleans, Leans, Leans. 
De colored troops fought nobly, 
The guns went a-la-ba-zam; 
We knocked de socks clean oft de heels 
Of General Packingham, ham, ham. 
Words by .1. M. JOHNSON, and Sung with great suceess by 
JOHNSON & SWAIN. 
If you ask for some amusement, 
Why just come with me to-day, 
We'll walk along Pacific Street, 
Down towards the Bay; 
Such sights for you will there be found, 
But nothing that will shock; 
You'll laugh your sides to splinters at 
The Sheenies on our block. 
There's the Cohens and the Lowens, 
From old Jerusalem, 
There's the Keysers and the Peysers 
From salt-fish Amsterdam; 
Of all the second- handed brokers 
They keep the finest stock, 
They've horrible pugs, and oh, what mugs, 
These Sheenies on our block. 
Cuonus: 
Little Mosey Gumplestein, 
Sitting in the sun; 
Laughing, shouting, 
For any kind of fun, 
Rise, Mosey, rise, 
Wipe your nose off with your sock; 
And when you're big, you'll represent 
The Sheenies on our block. 
THE SHEENIES ON OUR BLOCK—CoNnsuED. 
If you're in for speculation, 
Why that's the place to go; 
You'll find the greatest bargains, 
They've everything to show. 
From boots and shoes, coats and pants, 
To a 
rusty key and lock, 
Business is always tremendous with 
The Sheenies on our block. 
There's the Lesynskys, and Greezynkys 
From Poland far away, 
The Jacobs and the Josephs 
From Germany a 
day. 
They came in ' 49, 
Regular old time rocks.; 
The town's a 
curiosity with. 
The Sheenies on our block. 
'There is Solomon Isaac Levy, 
Who learned the Tailor trade; 
He has the largest family, 
The youngest just a 
babe. 
Twenty-one girls, two dozen boys, 
They live on the smell of hock; 
They're the rising generation of 
The Sheenies on our block. 
There's the Meyers, and the Mayers, 
They've got their business down; 
The Schlosses, and the Grosses, 
Who are so fat and sound. 
You can get just what you want there, 
Even old Granny's clock; 
Such enterprising colonists are 
The Sheenies on our block.

I'm the girl that sells the violets, 
To earn my daily bread; 
I've a 
little sister, and, alas, 
Our parents both are dead. 
They went to heaven long ago, 
And left this, a 
simple curl, 
To cheer us in our sadness, 
I'm Flo, the violet girl. 
Cnonus: 
Here, gentlemen, violets, gentlemen, 
TOUT purses now unfurl; 
You'll buy, I 
trust, indeed you must, 
From Flo, the violet girl. 
You ak me why so eager 
To sell my simple wares, 
I've a 
little sister to maintain, 
In her lies all my care. 
My mother told me when she died 
And left this world of whirl, 
When ill befell, to guard her well, 
For I'm Flo, the violet girl. 
But now, dear friends, good-bye, farewell, 
I'll come some other time; 
I 
hope you all are satisfied, 
With my little, simple rhyme. 
I've done my lest, your verdict 
Whether poor man, prince or earl 
Is, I'm number one, and now I'm done, 
I'm Flo, the violet girl. 
Words by J. M. JOHNSON, and sung by JOHNSON & SWAIN 
with great success. 
In Maryland I 
had a 
farm, 
And happy, oh, so happy there did dwell; 
'Till I 
fell in love with a 
colored girl, 
Her name was Flora Bell. 
I 
cast my eyes upon her face 
She bound me like a 
spell; 
And from that moment I 
loved that girl, 
Oh my pretty, my pretty Flora Bell. 
In joy I 
then did marry her, 
And happy, oh, so happy there did dwell; 
There were none so happy in all Maryland, 
As I 
and Flora Bell. 
When a 
white man came to Maryland, 
With some slaves to buy and sell; 
lie so enticed that he bore away 
My pretty, oh, my pretty Flora Bell. 
Broken hearted and weary, 
I 
wandered alone through the dell; 
When a 
colored girl fell at my feet, 
I 
saw it was Flora Bell. 
I 
thanked the Lord that I 
loved her still, 
When into my arms she fell; 
But in my arms she fell and died, 
My pretty, oh, my pretty Flora Bell.

Good evening, kind friends, I'll sing you a 
song, 
I'll strive to amuse you, and not keep you long; 
My Abject will be as you plainly see, 
Of our city in daylight and dark. 
Its elections and politics all ovec town, 
Some cheer, others swear, some laugh, others frown; 
Such shouting, such spouting is heard all around, 
You ask what it means, you know just for a 
lark. 
Cuottus: 
Our new President, our new President, 
We want a 
good man, boys, that won't cheat a 
cent; 
Contented we'll rest, 
If we get a 
good man for our new President. 
The frauds that we've had in office before 
have stole every dollar and then cried for more; 
There's one you all know, for the crooked did go, 
And into his pockets the money did fly. 
He angled, and wrangled, and scrambled so hard, 
You all know that Tweed and him were old pards; 
They cared not a 
straw if our good laws they marred, 
But felt of their pockets and said how's that for high.

DARLING AMONGST THE LADIES. 
Written by J. M. JOHNSON. Dedicated to Cua.s. H. DUNCAN. and sung' 
by JOHNSON & SWAIN With great success.

I'm a 
nobby swell of the upper ten, 
Dressed in the latest fashion; 
I 
always cut the greatest style, 
For ladies I've a 
passion. 
Of hats I 
have at least a 
score, 
The boys all cal! them cady's; 
The girls all cry as I 
pass by, 
He's the darling amongst the ladies, 
CHOHIJS: 
But still I 
love the darling girls, 
They call me pet and baby; 
They all do shout as I 
go out, 
He's the darling among the ladies. 
Not long ago I 
chanced to meet 
A 
sprightly little fairy; 
Who looked so sweet and dressed so neat, 
An angel light and airy. 
I 
called on her I 
must confess, 
My clothes looked rather fady; 
Her pa unkindly did throw out 
The dal ling amongst the Indies. 
I 
tell them I'm immensely rich, 
An heir to a 
large estate; 
Like aristocrats I 
always do 
Go to the theatre late. 
I've lately struck a 
banker's till, 
But please to keep it shady; 
For the police all are looking for 
The darling amongst the ladies.

SKELETON SONG. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1875, by A. J. 
Franca, in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
Original by ilomisoN it BRUNO. 
When dead men yawn at midnight, we come forth, 
And sing of merry days that we have seen; 
And lightly as the rustling of the wind, 
We dans..„ and sing and tumble on the green, 
We revel in the moonlight's yellow gleam, 
Until the chanticleer does loudly crow; 
By mortal eyes we never can be seen, 
For under the cold ground we quickly go. 
CHORUS. 
Rattle our bones, 
Over the stones ; 
[Break 
[Break 
Oh! pity us poor skeletons, forlorn; 
When the cocks crow, [ Break 
Under we go, [Break 
We sing and dance until the break of dawn. 
We do not fear the thunder's awful roar, 
Nor lightning, as it rushes through the sky! 
We'll never see our comrades any more, 
Until the day does come for them to die; 
But when death lays his hand upon their heads, 
We'll welcome them, and quickly show them how 
We pass away the time among the dead! 
What would they think if they could see us now? 
Rattle our bones, &c..

And we went for to fight de 'foe ;.

When work was done, we'd gather in de barn, 
For to rattle de heel and toe; 
And dance dat good old Mississippi fling, 
To de tune of de old banjo. 
We'll never see dem good old times again, 
For death has laid our Massa low; 
But de tears run down our cheeks like de rain, 
When we think of the way we used to go.

The Happy Limber Nigs.

Oh! white folks watch de motion of our feet. [Break 
To please you all we are bound to do it neat. [Break 
If we can only please you, 
When we make a

How gay us Nigs would be; 
Its then we used ter habe our fun

And since we left that good old home, 
We love to dance our jigs;

THE ACROBATIC WIGS. 
'Written expressly for JonNsoN & BRUNO, by H. BFNNETT 
Oh! dancing is a 
happy occupation, 
No matter whether dancing reels or jigs; 
But if you want to see a 
big sensation, 
Cast your optics on these Acrobatic Nigs; 
We learned our dancing down in Alabama, 
Where all de darkies sing and crack their jokes 
But if you want to burst yourself with laughter, 
Watch de motion of dese Indian Rubber Mokes

We're sure to make you think you are in Heaven 
For your troubles, boys, you will not care a 
fig ; 
Oh I 
watch us while we sling these number 'levens. 
We are double-breasted Acrobatic Nigs. 
Oh the boys were always jealous of these darkies, 
Because they couldn't sling themselves around; 
Oh! we used to set de Piccaninnies crazy, 
Two others, like us, never could be found; 
And often our old Massa used to wonder, 
And many times we've seen him shake his fist; 
For it used to make him just as mad as thunder, 
To watch us while we done our double-twist. 
We're sure to make you, Sw.

Written expressly by Mr. HERRON, for JOILNSON & BRUNO. 
They say that we are mad—perhaps its so— 
But we never could tell the reason why 
We like to rock upon the heel and toe ; 
And sling these number tens away, so high„ 
We were born among the cotton and the cane, 
And the Mania Monia Niggers is our name. 
Our hearts are always glad, and of course we're 
never sad— 
But everybody tells us that we're mad. . 
Oh! you couldn't keep us still if you should try, 
For we are de wildest darkies in de town ; 
We're lively as de lightning in de sky, 
Our daddy says hell have to nail us down. 
Oh I

We're sure to make you open wide your eyes, 
Our hearts are always glad, and of course we're

Oh ! such a

Oh dear! I

By the shady side of the lane ; 
And the eyes in my head goes rolling around, 
Whenever she passes by. 
CHORUS. 
For she's just as pretty as a 
little butterfly, 
That flies around in the grasses; 
For she's sweeter to me than purnpking pie, 
Sugar, bread and lasses. 
This little beauty I 
do declare, 
Is sweeter than a 
boll of cream; 
And the folks all say when she passes by, 
That she is the prettiest ever seen. 
Some day or other she'll be mine, 
I

And if that day don't ever come, 
I 
will lay me down and die.

THE FISHERMAN AND HIS CHILD. 
Sung by Tom DIXON at the San Francisco Minstrels, and made 
Popular by JAMES O'NEIL. 
The fisherman and his child are drowned, 
Came ringing through the town; 
The father and child lay under the tide, 
And friends did mourn around; 
The poor wife and mother prayed aloud, 
Oh, God! it cannot be, 
For in yonder mist I 
see them still, 
Their milk-white sails I 
see. 
(Repeat last 2 
lines.) 
CHORUS: 
'Twas the voice of their God that they heard 
As they sank in the deep; 
Come to me, I 
love thee, 
And thy precious soul I'll keep, 
Come to me, I 
love thee, 
Thy precious soul I'll keep. 
The fiAlerman saw his boat was lost. 
He tried to save his child, 
He battled the waves with all human power, 
But the wind was howling wild; 
Then he spoke to his child, 
She answered not; he raised her tiny head, 
He cried in despair; Thy will be done! 
The child he loved was dead. 
(Repeat 2 
last lines.) 
And when the storms ceased, the sea went down, 
Brave men went on the shore, 
The tide had gone out, they searched all about, 
From the sea two forms they bore, 
Their faces were calm, their hands were raised, 
As if in silent prayer, 
The father in life had clasped his child, 
In death they found him there. 
(Repeat 2 
last lines.)

BABY MINE. 
As sung with great success by BILLY McAr.msrErt, with L W. 
FAMOUS MINSTRELS. 
I've a 
baby in Kalamazoo. 
Baby mine—baby mine; 
He call skip the tra-la-la-loo, 
Baby mine—baby mine. 
He swings on our back gate, 
Tackles peaches by the crate, 
On a 
tishball he can skate, 
Baby mine—baby mine, 
lie can eat a 
barrel of cake, 
I3aby mine. 
He makes faces at the women, 
Baby mine—baby mine; 
In a 
soup bowl he goes swimming, 
Baby mine—baby mine. 
Out of the ash-pan we do yank him; 
In his high chair we do plank him, 
Oh, heavens! how we spank him, 
Baby mine—baby mine, 
His face would cave a 
bank in, 
Baby mine. 
At the table he is queer, 
Baby mine—baby mine; 
Stuffs the pan cakes in his ear, 
Baby mine—baby mine. 
Rubs molasses on his nose, 
Spills the mustard on his clothes, 
He jabs the hash tit tween his toes, 
Baby ntine—baby mine, 
And we wash him with a 
hose, 
Baby mine.

ANGEL'S CALL. 
Written by J. K. JouNsoN. Sung and made popular by DAN COLLYER. 
As the sun is' resting gently, 
At the close of this fair day; 
Angels fair from heavenly mansiqps, 
Gently, gladly float away; 
Through the halls of golden splendor, 
Through the maze of azure sky; 
Pause they o'er a 
cottage threshold, 
Where a 
bud has bloomed to die; 
Choi-us.—Sweet heavenly music, 
Dear cherubic band; 
I 
will sing with you soon, 
in sweet glory land. 
Hark, and bear the faintest whisper, 
Friends, I'm really going there; 
There's a 
host of angel's truly, 
Floating round me everywhere; 
Cherubs robed in dazzling splendor, 
With immortal crowns of light; 
I 
shall view them all in glory, 
In that land that is so bright. 
Chorus.—They are taking me now, 
On their bosoms I 
lie; 
I'm going to glory, 
Dear friends, sweet, good-bye. 
As the sun is setting, gently, 
At the close of this fair day; 
As I 
wander o'er the foliage, 
Thinking of days past away; 
There are heavenly visions round me, 
heavenly visions everywhere; 
For the mound in yonder churchyard, 
Represents an angel fair. 
Chvrem—She's sleeping so sweetly, 
Oh, there let her rest; 
With roses and lillies, 
Upon her pure breast.

Grandmother's Chair. 
Written by JOHN READ, and sung with great success as the latest hit n 
the season at HARRIGAN & HART'S Theatre Comique by EDWIN BARRY 
Music at E. H. HARDING'S, 229 Bowery, 
Copyrighted. 
My grandmother she at the age of eighty-three, 
One day in May was taken ill and died, 
And after she was dead, the will of course was read, 
By a 
lawyer as we all stood by his side, 
To my brother, it was found, she had left a 
hundred pounds 
The same unto my sister I 
do declare, 
But when it came to me, the lawyer said I 
see, 
She has left to you her " Old arm-chair." 
CHORUS. 
And how they titter'd, how they chaff'd, 
How my brother and sister laugh'd, 
When they heard the lawyer declare 
Granny had only left to me her old arm chair. 
I 
thought it hardly fair, still I 
said I 
did not care, 
And in the ev'ning took the chair away, 
The neighbors they me chaff'd, my brother at me laugh'd 
And said it would be useful John, some day. 
When you settle down in life find some girl to be your wife, 
You'll find it very handy, I 
declare. 
On a 
cold and frosty night when the fire is burning bright, 
You cat, then sit in your old arm chair. 
And how they titter'd, &c. 
What my brother said came true for in a 
year or two, 
Strange to say I 
settled down in married life, 
I 
first the girl did court, and then the ring I 
bought, 
Took her to church and when she was my wife, 
The old girl and me, were as happy as could be, 
For when my work was over I 
declare, 
I 
ne'er abroad would roam but each night would stay at home, 
And be seated in my old arm chair. 
And how they titter'd, & c. 
One night the chair fell down, when I 
pick'd it up I 
found, 
The seat had fallen out upon the floor. 
And there to my surprise, I 
saw before my eyes, 
A 
lot of notes, two thousand pounds or more, 
When my brother heard of this, the fellow I 
confess, 
Went nearly mad with rage and tore his hair, 
But I 
only laugh'd at him, and said unto him, Jem, 
Don't you wish you had the old arm chair? 
And how they titter'd, &c.

Can you so soon forget me, 
You loved me once so well; 
You loved me in the Summertime, 
The Wintertime as well; 
You said you would never leave me, 
My love you would never forget; 
And often in our tales of love, 
I 
called you my dearest pet. 
CHORUS: 
In the evening when 'twas 
You've often sat beside me; 
Whispering love, my turtle dove, 
Can you so soon forget me; 
I'm fading like the flowers, 
That blushed and bloomed in Suninger 
Dear is the vision that merrily recalls, 
Can you forget me so soon? 
Then my heart shall feel no trouble, 
My head shall feel no pain; 
Only to see thee, darling, 
And hear thy voice again. 
Just to press thy ruby lips, 
Your sunny face I 
see; 
Don't forget me, darling, 
Can you so soon forget me?

SHE'S ALL THE HEART COULD FANCY. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Written by SAUL SERTREW. 
'Twas going to the Central Park, 
To take the country air, 
And see the fishes and the swans, 
And other sights so rare, 
I 
met a 
pair of roguish eyes, 
That pierced me through and through, 
And made me feel so very queer, 
I 
scarce knew what to do. 
CHORUS. 
She was all the heart could fancy, 
And lovely as a 
queen, 
And just about the gayest of the gay; 
And it was her pair of roguish eyes, 
That pierced me thro' and thro' and thro' 
And charmed my heart and senses all away. 
(DanCe.) 
Her dress was made in the latest style, 
And trimmed with charming taste, 
She wore a 
brilliant necklace, toe, 
Of diamonds—made of paste; 
Her golden hair in ringlets fell, 
Around her lovely neck, 
And since her charming face I've seen, 
My heart's a 
perfect wreck. 
She was all, etc. 
Little Cabin Home in South Caroline. 
Written by N ED OLIVER, and sung by J. F. 
FIEL»S. 
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, 
I'm glad to see you all; 
I 
was just a 
passing by this way, 
I 
thought I'd give you a 
call, 
To tell you how the darkies 
Used to frolic one and all, 
In that little cabin home in South Caroline. 
CHORUS. 
Don't talk of ' mancipation proclamation unto me; 
I 
was happier in slavery then I've been since I've been free. 
Oh ! we war so jolly, we war as happy as could be 
In that little cabin home in South Caroline. 
We used to get up in the morn, 
Before the break of day, 
And go off singing to our work 
In the cotton fields away. 
And when night came we'd sing and dance 
And on the banjo play, 
In that little cabin home in South Caroline. 
CHORUS. 
But these happy days are past and gone many years ago, 
My eyes are growing weak and dim, my steps are getting slow, 
And the time am drawing nearer now in which I'll have to go 
From that little cabin home in South Caroline. 
Life on the Mississippi. 
:Sung by His and BLossom. 
Oh good evening to you, one and all, 
We have just come out to sing a 
little ditty, 
It's about the times that's past and gone, 
When we used to work on the grand old Mississippi. 
The passengers they used to wink, 
And look at us so sly, 
Because we'd dance and do our breaks, 
And throw our feet so high. 
But when we get through our little ditty, 
We'll go back again to the grand old Mississippi. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
Now, white folks, we can no longer stay, 
Or the folks at home will think we've run away. 
But the next time we visit your great city 
We hope you won't forget our little ditty. 
Our old massa was as good a 
man 
As ever you did see ; 
He used to feed us on hoe cake, 
And sometimes hominy. 
Now when we 7et done our little ditty, 
We'll go back ag-in to the grand old Mississippi.

So if you will just list to me, 
I'll make you understand; 
A 
few things that some here don't know, 
Of my own dear native land. 
ClIORUS: 
Then for wit, good nature, 
Where's the men to beat those from our Soil? 
They're ever frisky, ever gay, 
And willing hard to toil; 
They'll shake a 
stranger by the hand, 
And greet him with a 
smile; 
These are the sort of men you'll find, 
If you visit Erin's Isle. 
I've heard you call us ragged Pat, 
And dirty Irish, too; 
But we can dress in pomp and style, 
Ah! just as well as you; 
We've gained respect through all the world, 
And on every distant shore— 
They praise " O'Connell," " Goldsmith," 
And our late " Sir Thomas Moore." 
(Chorus), 
THE " MODERN SWELL" OF ERIN—CONTINUED. 
There's bad and good in every clime, 
That each of us well know; 
But still, to class all men alike, 
'Tis wrong you should do so; 
Is there a 
flock that hasn't got 
A 
black sheep, tell me that? 
Then take my tip, you'll find worse friends 
Than those you call poor Pat. 
I 
hope that with my little song, 
I've offended none of you; 
But always bear this in your mind, 
As this world you travel through— 
That man is man, and who is more, 
No matter what he he; 
Pat is flesh and blood, as well as you, 
Then why not all agree? 
(Chorus).

(Chorus.) 
A 
comic effusion sang by FRANK LEWIS, at Harry Miner's 
Theatre, New York. 
The other night while feeling blue, 
I 
thought I'd stroll around; 
And sec some of the famous sights 
With which this town abounds; 
A 
strange sensation thrilled me, 
And my throat felt dry and oueer; 
So I 
stepped into a 
beer saloon, 
To get a 
glass of beer. 
I 
found it so refreshing, 
I 
thought I'd try one more; 
And liking the experiment, 
I 
repeated o'er and o'er; 
Some very funny fancies 
To my mind did soon appear, 
I'll tell you some of the sights I 
saw, 
Full of Lion Brewery Beer. 
I 
saw the waiters in this hottsf, 
When schooners they did bring: 
Peep slyly through the door to see 
If the Cap was on the wing; 
I 
saw spy Kimball on the train 
Where Whitney round did tear; 
Because he'd not appear in Court, 
And bring the gamblers there. 
Captain Williams in a 
garbage box, 
Was sentenced there to dwell; 
And stay until the Judgment day, 
And live upon the smell; 
The Salvation Army the other night 
Were off upon a 
tear, 
They were found up at Harry Hill's, 
Full of Lion Brewery Beer. 
LION BREWERY BEER—CoNTINuED. 
We had no railroad accidents, 
And stocks were above par; 
Beecher kept a 
beer saloon, 
John B. Gough tended bar; 
I 
saw Conkling commit suicide, 
When Jim Blaine won the race; 
When they both ran like Garfield's mill 
In his Cabinet for a 
place. 
Steve Taylor and George Rooke I 
saw, 
Fight the other day; 
That is, I 
would have seen them fight, 
But Taylor ran away; 
I 
saw the exhibition start, 
Which Grant is trying to stew; 
I 
saw our dirty streets kept clean 
Full of Lion Brewery Beer. 
And now, kind friends, I'll leave you, 
But there's one thing I 
will say; 
I 
hope I 
have amused you with 
My quiet little lay; 
I 
book it for a 
topic, 
To pass the time along; 
And try and sing you something new, 
In the way of a 
comic song. 
There's many times that l've appeared 
Before you one and all, 
A warm and loving welcome 
I've received from great and small; 
So to my New York friends 
I 
now return my thanks again, 
I'll drink your health in a 
social glass 
Of Lion Brewery Beer.

MY ELDEST DAUGHTER CLA_RA, 
Copyrighted by A. J. Fisher, 1880. 
Written by James Richmond for Pat Rooney and sung, 
by him with great success. 
Sure I 
have a 
lovely daughter, 
On the stage she cuts a 
dash, 
She wears blonde wigs and powders her face, 
To try and catch a 
mash. 
She can dance a 
tailor's hornpipe, 
She tells the old woman that she is fine, 
She wears flesh colored pants when sh.± comes 
out to dance, 
And gets drunk on German wine. 
CHORUS. 
She wears dizzy diamonds and wings on her back, [break. 
In the ballet dance she is like a 
jumping jack, [break. 
She has a 
barrel of paint on her face, 
Like a 
fairy from Conamarra, 
The pride of the McCormick family, 
Is my, eldest daughter Clara. 
You should see her in the can-can,. 
She is the dead picture of her ma, 
She has a 
foot as big as a 
telegraph pole, 
Her features are like her pa. 
She has all the swells near crazy, 
An engagement for life she has signed, 
She is hitched to a 
man named Freddie McCan, 
He has a 
million dollars in his mind.

Price 40 cents. 
Published by permission. 
We've oft sung of the major, 
And of the captain too, 
But now I've chosen for my rhyme 
A 
subject new to you. 
'Tis of our gallant soldier boys, 
All honor them the while, 
Out boys in blue and sailors true, 
Who belong to the Rank and File. 
CHORUS. 
Eyes right ! Steady, boys! 
Merrily we cheer, 
Under the starry flag, 
That ever we hold dear. 
Gaily the music plays, 
The ladies love to smile 
Upon the throng a 
thousand strong, 
Who belong to the Rank and File. 
In the tented field of honor 
We hold our lives but small, 
And bravely clan together 
At the bugle's martial call. 
We greet the shouts of victory 
With cheers and saddened smile, 
And sigh for slaughtered comrades 
Who belonged to the Rank and File. 
Eyes right, & c. 
When in the days of Seventy-
six 
Our country plunged in war, 
And peril ev'rywhere beset 
Our foe invaded shore; 
Bold, sturdy men were needed then, 
To win proud vict'ry's smile, 
So while we're here let's give a 
cheer 
For America's Rank and File.

consecutive nights.

Last Wednesday I 
attended 
A 
raffle for a 
stove, 
In aid of the wife and family 
Of Timothy J. Cosgrove. 
Kellys, Hogans, and O'Briens, 
All came in a 
drove, 
To take the dice and shake them nice, 
And try and win the stove. 
CHORUS. 
Forward four, allaman left, while the music it did play, 
'Twas grand delight to see the sight of those Irishmen so 
gay, 
I 
never laughed so hearty in the course of all my life 
Looking at Plug McCarty, pivotin' with his wife. 
At nine o'clock precisely 
The raffling it begun, 
Tom Kelly he jumped ten foot high 
When sixty-four was flung; 
O'Brien yelled out murder, 
With a 
brick his eye was closed ; 
On that night I 
had to fight, 
While raffling for the stove. 
(Chorus.) 
At six o'clock in the morning 
The raffling it was o'er, 
Tom Kelly he got staving drunk 
And stole away the door; 
Clancy with a 
botte, 
Sure he all the windows broke; 
Cosgrove grabbed him by the neck, 
And boys, I 
thought he'd choke. 
(Chorus.)

I 
wish my love and I 
was sailing, 
As far from land as far could be, 
War, far across the deep blue water, 
Where I'd have none to trouble me. 
Sweet Maggie Gordon you are my bride, 
Come sit you down upon my knee, 
And tell to me the very reason 
Why I 
am slighted thus by thee. 
The sea is deep, I 
can't swim over, 
Neither have I 
the wings to fly, 
But I 
will hire some jolly sportsman, 
To carry o'er my love and I. 
Sweet Maggie Gordon, (Scc 
I 
wish I 
had a 
glass of brandy, 
The reason I 
will tell to thee, 
Because when drinking, I 
am thinking, 
Does my true love remember me.

My name is McNamara, 
And I 
came from County Clare, 
In the darling little Isle across the sea, 
Where the mountains and the hills, 
And the brooks and rippling rills, 
Are Nature's sweetest music all the day. 
Our little farm was small; it could not support usall 
So one of us was forced away from home. 
And I 
bade them all good bye, 
With a 
tear drop in my eye, 
And I 
sailed for Castle Garden all alone. 
Ononus. 
I'm an honest Irish lad, 
And of work I'm not afraid, 
If it's pleasure to you I 
will sing and dance, 
Yes, I'll do anything you say, 
If you will only name the day, 
When they'll give an honest Irish lad a 
chance. 
When I 
landed in New York, 
I 
tried hard to get work, 
Yes, I 
traveled through *.the streets from day to day, 
And I 
went from place to place, 
With starvation in my face, 
HONtST IRISH LAD. 
(Continued). 
When I 
ask for work they want no help, they say, 
Yet still I 
wandered on, 
In hopes I 
would find one, 
Who would give a 
lad a 
chance to earn his bread, 
But I 
find it's all the same, 
And I 
know I'm not to blame, 
And I 
often times have wished that I 
was dead. 
(Chorus.) 
But I 
know I 
have one kind friend, 
Who a 
helping hand will lend 
To a 
poor boy and help him on at home, 
And I'll bring my mother here, 
And my little sister, dear, 
And never from them more again I'll roam. 
I 
will try and do what's right, 
I 
will work both day and night, 
Yes, I'll try and do the very best 1". can, 
And God will bless the heart 
That will take a 
poor boy's part, 
And make an honest Irish lad a 
man,

He Must Not DoThis and He Must Not DoThat. 
Young Kitty lov'd dearly her Thomas, 
She loved him with all her true heart; 
But Kitty, I 
fear, had a 
temper, 
And was sometimes what people call " tart." 
She used to find fault with poor Thomas so much, 
And never would leave him alone, 
She always was at him whatever he did, 
Till Thomas, despairing, would groan. 
Cno. For he must not do this and he must not do that, 
Till Thomas got qui'e in a 
stew, 
For he might not do that and he might not do this 
Till he did not know what he might do. 
By appointment he met her one evening, 
She said he had come much too soon, 
She would not stay out o'er five minutes 
On account of there being no moon. 
Ile bade her good night at the small garden gate, 
And was just 'bout to give her a 
kiss. 
When she drew herself up and said, " Thomas ! 
Remember you must not do this !" (Cito.) 
He met her again by appointment, 
The hour arrang'd on was eight, 
lie was there quite ten minutes before that , 
She said he was half an hour late! 
The moon was not up and yet she stayed out, 
At parting he took off his hat, 
When she drew herself up and said " Thomas! 
Remember you must not do that !" (Clio 
So Thomas then said, " My dear Kitty, 
I 
do not know what I'm to do, 
For I 
must not do this, and I 
must not do that, 
And I 
only want, love, to please you." 
Sweet Kitty replied, " When I 
tell you, dear Tom, 
That you must not do that or do this— 
Just mind do the reverse, and you'll please me the best— 
You must not now give me a 
kiss." 
CHO. But he gave her a 
kiss, aye, and half a 
score more, 
And he now finds it is the best plan, 
When he must not do this and he must not do that 
To do it once lits_a man.

A

To speak to her I

Across upon the other side, 
'Twas plain enough to see, 
I 
will go and ask my mother if she's 
Good enough for me. 
CHORUS. 
Then we'd both go home together,

With hearts as light as feathers. (syn.) 
Good evening white folks, one and all, 
Soon married we will be, 
I

Good enough for me. 
Oh, there he goes, I

And do it mighty well.

Good enough for me. 
Good evening now, Maria. dear,

How oft we sat together, 
Down by the running brook. 
Oh, yes, my dearest petty, 
It is plain enough to see, 
I

Published and copyrighted 1878 by E. 
H. 
HARDING, 229 Bowery. 
Price 40 cents. 
Published by permission. 
Dedicated to HARRY M INER, New York. 
The red, red rose that lovely grows, 
And blushes like a 
maiden, 
Keeps nodding to the gentle breeze, 
With rosy perfume laden ; 
To greet a 
little tiny elf, 
For her my heart is yearning; 
And lately I 
am scarce myself, 
My heart with love is blooming. 
CHORUS. 
Little Cherry Blossom, will you love me ? 
Little Cherry Blossom, will you wed me? 
'While the stars are twinkling in the silent dell 
Such a 
tale of love I'll tell thee ! (Repeat.) 
The lily all proclaim so fair, 
She is the queen of flowers; 
The rose, they say, conveys true love, 
'Mid Cupid's shining bowers; 
The Pansie says, " forget me not !" 
The Laurel crowns with glory, 
The one that's fairer than the lot, 
The subject of my story. 
Little Cherry Blossom, &c. 
The dew upon the rose is like 
The tears that she is shedding, 
Impatient for a 
day to come, 
For soon there'll be a 
wedding; 
And from life's garden I 
shall cull 
A 
fair and fragrant flower, 
And keep it blooming all my life, 
Within love's happy bower. 
Little Cherry Blossom, &c.

Chariot te Temple.—To those who have never perused the

an opportunity is afforded of reading one of the most absorbing works 
ever written, proving " truth stranger than fiction." The poet's lines 
are but a 
just description of the unfortunate Charlotte Temple: 
Her form was faultless, and her mind 
Untainted yet by art, 
Was noble, just, humane and kind, 
And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ah I 
the cruel spoiler came—" 
This book, in the language of Mrs. Rowson "affords a 
striking example 
that vice, however prosperous 
in the beginning, in the end only leads 
to misery and shame."

IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
It is a Fac simile of a Trick practiced by all 
the Professors of _Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept-
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic ordes 
has been sent us, called HUMPTY DII3IPTY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear= 
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Varlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. 
A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at , home in the hand-
ling of it."—Phila. Evening Bulletin. r
