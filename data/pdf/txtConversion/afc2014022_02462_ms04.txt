Interview Date: April 2, 2015 
Interview Location: Vermont Beancrafters, Warren, VT 
 
This is another interview in a series aimed at exploring the network of growers and 
producers who supply Fletcher Allen Hosptial/University of Vermont Medical 
Center. 
 
Due to a discrepancy between the time listed in my calendar and the time Joe and I 
agreed to in an email I ended up arriving around 45 minutes before he did for the 
interview. At the time I thought he was late and was a tad annoyed, but once I got 
back home I realized it was my fault.  VT Beancrafters is based at the Kingsbury 
Market Garden in Warren, VT—yet another operation distributed across several 
buildings and yet another where we had not yet established where to meet.  I 
eventually found some people in a green house and asked where I could find Joe, 
and they directed me to another outbuilding. Found two people in there in the 
commercial kitchen—one of whom said he was waiting on Joe too—and they 
directed me to wait in the office. 
 
It was cold in there and there was a barely effectual, noisy electric heater running.   
 
I waited for Joe to arrive and he was a bit harried by my presence (I realized later 
that he hadn’t yet expected me to be there) and we sat down for a chilly, noisy 
interview about Beancrafters and Joe’s vision for the business and his interest in 
staple foods and what he terms “food justice.” 
 
On the balance I was really impressed.  I had no idea what to expect going into this 
(was he one of those trust fund hipsters I hear so much about? Was he a slick 
business guy?) and I left feeling he is a sincere person dedicated to expanding 
availability to quality food and dedicated to the production of staple foods and to 
grains.  I liked him.  Interview is rich in his discourse on these topics and some 
insight into his background and training.  He gave me a lot of time too, which I 
appreciated. 
 
Most interesting to me from the VFC’s perspective is how his interest in beans and 
his new move into tortillas can intersect with Dia de los Muertos. I will be sure to 
follow up with him in the coming months to see how we can connect.
