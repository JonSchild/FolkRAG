PREFACE . 
A FEW WORDS WITH THE READER. 
IN 
order to keep my- friends fully " up to the times" 
in a 
knowledge of the very best songs now popular,. I 
have arranged this song book. 
It is not crowded with a 
mass of pieces that few can sing, and that fewer will ever 
want to sing; but it is a 
painstaking collection of all the 
choice songs of the day—songs that every vocalist must 
wish to know; songs that become favorites the moment 
they are heard. 
Interspersed with the best pieces of our 
leading singers will be found many of my own specialties 
—songs that I 
am justly proud to say are never sung by 
me without winning hearty encores from that generous 
public which has always so kindly appreciated and liber-
ally rewarded my efforts to please. 
Most thankful for past, and hopeful for Mure, favors, 
I 
am the Public's most obediently, 
JOHNNY ROACH.

PAT DEL.ANEY. 
PARODY ON riT,T,RFN ALLANNA. 
As 
sung by JOHNNY RCACH. 
Mu name is Pat Delaney, I 
came across the sea, 
I 
live in a 
great big tenement house way up in Avenue C; 
A family they live next to me, they kick up a 
terrible 
roar 
About their EilleAn Allanna and their Angus Astore ; 
First the eldest by and then his youngest brother, 
They all join in the chorus with their sister and their mo-
ther; 
When I 
get home at night, ray boys, I 
hear this terrible 
roar 
About their Eileen Allanna and their Augus Astore. 
CHORUS. 
Working hard all day, I 
think it is too bad, 
Climbing a 
forty-foot ladder, carrying a 
great big hod, 
When I 
get home at night, my boys, I 
hear this terri-
ble roar 
About their Eileen Allanna and their Angus Astore. 
Early in the morning before I 
do get up, 
Before I 
eat a 
mouthful, before I 
drink a 
sup, 
I 
hear them in the hallway and then they commence to 
roar 
About their Eileen Allanna and their Angus Astore ; 
If I'd influence in the ward in which I 
do belong, 
I'd go and see the judge and have him push this case 
quite strong, 
I'd have them all arrested, and that would stop their roar 
Aboat their Eileen Allanna and their Augus Astore. 
Working hard all day, etc.

LAST night I 
was out rather late— 
'Twas only an innocent spree— 
My wife for my coming did wait, 
When sleeping I 
thought she would be 
I 
found her in temper and tears; 
Oh ! she cried, it's a 
sin and a 
shame— 
And she scratched both my eyes and my ears, 
But I 
told her I 
soon would explain. 
CHORDS . 
The " Club" had a 
meeting, to-night, love, • 
Of hus'ness we had a 
great sight, love ; 
Don't think for a 
moment I'm tight, love, 
I've only been down to the Club. 
My boots I 
left down in the hall, 
And softly I 
crept up the stairs; 
I 
kept rather close to the wall, 
And thought to ascend unawares 
But just as I 
got to the door, 
I 
seemed to get lost in the dark 
I 
stumbled and fell on the floor, 
And just then I-could only remark— 
The " Club" had, etc. 
he sobbed and she wept and she screamed, 
And said she'd go back to her ma; 
'While I 
tin the mantel- piece leaned, 
And tried to enjoy my cigar. 
I 
promised to buy her a 
dress 
If she'd let me alone for awhile -; 
Then I 
gave her a 
sweet little kiss, 
And I 
saw her beginning to smile. 
TOKEN .— So I 
thought it a 
favorable opportunity to assure 
ter once more, as a 
positive fact, that—

THERE'S a

And by faith we can see it afar, 
For the Father waits over the way 
To prepare us a 
dwelling place there. 
CHORUS. 
In the sweet by-and-by 
We shall meet on that beautiful shore, 
In the sweet by-and-by 
We shall meet on that beautiful shore. 
We shall sing on that beautiful shore 
The melodious songs of the blest, 
And our spirits shall sorrow no more— 
Not a 
sigh for the blessing of rest. 
CHORUS. 
In the sweet by-and-by 
We shall meet on that beautiful shore, 
In the sweet by-and-by 
We shall meet on that beautiful zlork. 
To our bountiful Father above 
We will offer the tribute of praise, 
For the glorious gift of his love, 
And the blessings that hallow our days.

In the sweet by-and-by 
We shall meet on that beautiful shore, 
In the sweet by-and-by 
We shrill meet on that beautiful shore.

COME, come and be converted, 
Come from wickedness and sin; 
Let the devil be deserted, 
Come and join the band within; 
Hear us preach, and hear us pray, 
Join us in each happy lay; 
While you're loose and led astray, 
Come and join the band. 
CHORUS. 
Come, come, every Yankee, 
Every sinner Giro' the land; 
Pray with Moody, sing with Sankey, 
Come, come, and join the band.. 
Now the glory flows around us, 
Angels blow their bugles loud; 
Sinners bless the day they found us, 
See them creeping through the crowd; 
All the world we've come to heal— 
Into every breast we steal, 
We are for the nation's weal, 
Come and join the band. 
Come, come, etc. 
We have crossed the mighty ocean, 
Now we're back, with glory crown'd; 
We have gained the world's devotion, 
Stich a 
wicked lot we found; 
From the aged and the wise, 
Sever'd from their sinful ties, 
We have heard repenting cries, 
When they joined the band. 
Come, come, etc.

2. A 
young man courts a 
pretty girl, 
And fancies she adores him; 
But when he thinks the game is won, 
With some one else away she'll run; 
Of course, he'll swear he doesn't cars, 
Although it nearly floors him, 
And all the while he seems to smile, 
It goes against the grain. 
Cho.—He'll fit the cap, &c. 
11. Old maids, who don't deny their age 
Is something over thirty, 
May say they hate the sight of men, 
But still we find them now and then, 
At half a 
chance return a 
glance, 
And some get gay and flirty; 
Which shows, if they still single stay, 
It goes against the grain. 
Cho.—They fit the cap, &c. 
4. The vile garotters, when they're caught, 
And that is none too often, 
Are now rewarded with the cat, 
They very much object to that, 
And if some say its not the way, 
Their brutal hearts to soften, 
It makes them yell, so we can tell 
it goes against the grain. 
Cho.—But they fit the cap, ex. 
3. Since Nelson's day upon the sea, 
We've changed our style of fighting; 
Still the brave blue jacket lads, 
Cooped inside the ironclads, 
Are just as game, and true of aim, 
When wrongs require a 
righting; 
As every foe must know, although 
It goes against the grain.

rick's Day, • 
With fifes and drums a- playing martial airs, 
From Ulster, Munster, Connainara, you see we are on hand, 
To march with the music to the tune of the Branigan's Band; 
Oh! we march so gayly down the street, 
And ev'ry one we meet says, don't they step it neat! 
We smile on all the girls we meet, 
While marching down behind the famous Branigan's Band. 
CEIORII2t. 
Mark time, keep step, forward, march away 
With eyes out, toes in, march in grand array 
Shoulder arms, with head erect, together hand in hand, 
Like heroes bold the young and old will march with the Brani-
gan's Band. 
The chambermaids in the big hotels, they raise the windeys 
high, 
For handkerchiefs they're waving towels to catch our soldiers' 
eyes ; 
They've left their hash to come out and mash when the mar-
shal gives command; 
Then we all raise our hats to the tune of the Branigan's Band; 
Oh! don't their hearts go pit- a-pat, 
As each one lifts his hat, the lean as well as fit, 
Says, there's my Dan, there goes my Pat, 
He's the Daisy swell that's with the famous Brpnigan's Band. 
Mark time, etc. 
Oh, we had a 
ball in Emerald Hall, and an illegant ulipner, too; 
There was beans and peas and frigazees, and oysters fat for you, 
With pickled stews, and hullaboloos, and Irish quail so grand; 
Beets, and cheese, and some potheen for the boys of the Brani-
gan's Band. 
Oh! it's then we sang, and danc'cl a 
reel, 
And oh! how good we feel, we make the ladies squeal, 
So when morning comes it's home we steal, 
With the boys all drunk as lords, with the Branigan's Band.

TICE TIEN CONVENTION. 
A 
famous lien Convention 
Was held in Humbug Green— 
Such a 
S..ow of fuss and f
eathers 
Ne'er before was seen, 
With Malays, Bantams, Chitagongs„, 
And game- fowls, fine and tall; 
But Mr. Rooster Shanghai 
Cut the biggest swell of all. 
It was cackle, cackle, cackle, click*, 
Flap your wings and crow; 
And Shanghai shanged the highest 
At the Hen Convention Show, 
Says Malay, pulling out his gills, 
"I'm the fairest fowl," 
Says Bantam, " You're a 
hen-pick'd race. 
Ilen-hearted, with no soul." 
Says Shanghai, " Your poor Bantams 
Are a 
race of chicken toys," 
Says Bantam, " If you peck at me, 
You'll find I'm one of the boys." 
It was cackle, he. 
• 
A-Oultry duel came on straight— 
"['was Bantam and Shanghai ; 
A 
crow at first, and then a 
clip, 
And then the feathers fly. . 
Young Bantam spurred him flat, 
Amid a 
lond convention crow; 
ii.nd Shanghai shanged the lowest 
At the great Convention Show.

AN, 
THE 
itiRAVE POLICRMA.N. 
A 
new and original song, written and sung by W ILLIAM BCANLAIST, in his 
new and original sketch, entitled, "6- Wanted, a 
Lodger; Or, 
The Life of a 
Alulberry Street Policeman." 
Mr name is O'llalleran, and from Ireland I 
came, 
And since I 
came here I
've gained great fame; 
The captains and aldermen all know me well, 
And my heroism and bravery they can easily.tell ; 
If at night on my beat as 1 
walk to and fro, 
The blackguards they see me, arrah, from me they'll go, 
To an alleyway or bar-room they'll run if they can, 
For they all know well I'm a 
brave policeman. 
CHORUS. 
For as I 
promenade my beat at night through the street 
I'm admired by every young lady I 
meet; 
You'll hear them all sigh as hard as they can, 
For they're all deep in love with thiS brave policeman. 
When I 
first came from Ireland I 
was rather green, of course, 
But I 
very soon got smart when I 
went on the force; 
'Twas then I 
plucked up, and my courage did show, 
And was greeted no matter where'er I 
did go; 
As we led the parade on Saint Patrick's day, 
You can bet we looked grand as we all marched away; 
My countrymen would shout " Hurrah for 0 
Holleran, 
lie's the pet of the force, and a 
brave policeman." 
Foras I 
promenade, etc. 
I 
was very soon promoted to a 
roundsman you see, 
And respected no matter where'er I 
might be; 
They put sthripes on my arms to look solid and grand, 
For they knew I 
was a 
hero from dear Paddy's land; 
But it's very strange, my friends, if I 
don't soon be mayor, 
For there's not a 
man more able or fit for that chair, 
And providing they 
dn'elterYthing•-• 
Ivan 
o 
hould my reputation as a 
true Irishman. 
For as I

Price 40 cents. 
WHEN rill dead and gone from you, darling, 
When I'm laid away in my grave, 
When my spirit has gone to heaven above, 
To Him who my soul will save; 
When you are happy and gay once more, 
Thinking of days that have been; 
This one little wish I 
ask of you— 
See that my grave's kept green. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the days will come to you, darling, 
When on earth no more I'll be seen; 
One sweet little wish, darling, grant me— 
See that my grave's kept green. 
Though the hours of joy now are passing, 
Yet how soon, alas I 
they will fade ; 
Though your glances of love are meeting my owns 
Fair sunlight will turn to shade ; 
When from the world and its hopes I 
go, 
Leaving forever this scene, 
Though others are dear, ah, will you then 
See that my grave's kept green ? 
Oh, the days, etc. 
Will you keep me, love, in remembrance, 
Though the voice of chiding be heard ? 
And while others may speak in censure or blames 
Yet breathe no unkindly word; 
Tell me you'll think of the happy past, 
Think of the joys we have seen ; 
This one little promise keep for me— 
See that my gryre's kept green. 
Oh, ths( days,, etc.

THE theatre was full, it was Dorkins' night, 
That is, Dorkins was going to appear 
At night in a 
favorite comedy part, 
For he was comedian here. 
Funny ? why, he'd make you laugh 
Till the tears ran down your face like rain, 
And as long as Dorkins was on the stage 
You'd try to stop laughing in vain. 
A 
family ? yes, he'd a 
family, 
And he loved them as dear as life, 
And you'd scarcely find a 
happier lot 
Than Dorkins' children and wife. 
And you'd scarcely find a 
happier lot 
Than Dorkins children and wife. 
There came one night, 
And I 
was in front, 
And Dorkins was going to play 
A 
character new to himself and the stage 
That he'd trod for so many a 
day. 
By eight the theatre was perfectly crammed, 
All awaited a 
pleasant surprise, 
For they knew they would laugh 
Till their sides would ache, 
And they longed for the curtain to rise. 
The play soon began; 
Each neck was stretched forth, 
And eagerly watched each eye 
For Dorkins to make 
His " first entrance," and then 
To give him a 
cheerful." Hi,.hi 1" 
(1) 
DORKIN'S' NIGHT.-L2Coticluded. 
He soon appeared 
Amid loud applause, 
But something was wrong 
You could see. 
" 
Dorkins is playing 
Quite biidly to-night," 
The people said sitting round me. 
A 
hiss ? yes, it was. 
I 
saw Dorkins start 
As though stung by a 
serpent's fang; 
Then he'd cast a 
beseeching glance all around, 
And his head on his breast would hang. 
He's drunk, and really 
I 
thought so myself. 
For to me it was awful at times 
To see how he'd struggle 
Along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines. 
The footlights at last 
He approached very slow, 
And, " Ladies and gentlemen," said, 
" 
If I 
cannot please you to-night, 
The fault's not the heart, 
But the head. 
There's many a 
night 
I've made you all laugh 
When so ill I 
could scarcely 
Well stand, 
And every effort was pain to me then, 
Yes, if even I 
raised but my hand. 
'You hiss me to-night, 
And think that I'm drunk 
From his heart came a 
sob.and a 
D20/111) ; 
tell you the reason— • 
I 
know you won't laugh— 
I've a 
little one dying at home."

SOON I 
will leave thee, 
My dear German home, 
In a 
new land afar off, 
A 
stranger I'll roam ; 
Away from the friends 
Who have loved me so dear, 
But though far away, 
In my heart ever near. 
CHORUS. 
My old German home, 
On the banks of the Rhine, 
May the sun of prosperity 
On it brightly shine; 
rm going to leave thee, 
Afar off to roam, 
But I'll never forget 
My old German home. 
I 
see around me, 
Those friends kind and true, 
Who have loved me since childhood; 
'Tis hard to leave you; 
Soon I 
will come back 
To this 
.,good home once more, -
May prosperity attend you, 
As in days of yore.

FAR away in sunny meadows, 
Where the merry sunbeams plafd, 
Oft I 
lingered ' mid the clover, 
Singing to a 
village maid; 
She was fairer thim the fairest, 
Ever faithful, fond, and true ; 
And she wore beneath a 
bonnet, 
Amber tresses tied in blue. 
CHORUS. 
She was fairer than Cite fairest, 
Ever faithful, fond, and true 
And she wore beneath a 
bonuet. 
Amber tresses tied in blue. 
Ere the summer days departed, 
We had made a 
solemn vow; 
And I 
never, never wearied 
Kissing her sweet cheek and brow. 
She was dearer than the clearest, 
Pure as drops of morning dew; 
And adown her neck was hanging 
Amber tresses tied in blue. 
She was fairer, eta, 
'Twas decreed that Fate should part us 
Ere the leaves of autumn fell, 
And two loving hearts were severed, 
That had loved each other well. 
She was all I 
had to cherish, 
She has bade a 
last adieu, 
And I 
see in ev'ry vision 
Amber tresses tied in blue. 
She was fairer, etc.

HOME RULE. 
rung by joararr ROACH. 
Composed by lass Ls 
Copyright, 1875, by JOHN ROACH. 
IT'S many years ago in Ireland, you must know, 
Since happiness looked down on our land, 
Our sons they then were free, and the star of liberty 
Shone gloriously on every Irishman. 
But let us bar the door on the days that are no more, 
There's a 
light a 
beaming on us from afar, 
If you listen unto me I 
will tell you, do you see, 
The sentiments of Pat of Mullingar. 
CHORUS. 
Hurrah for Erin's Isle, though her sons you can beguile, 
Because they know the wolf is at the door, 
Yet may our flag be seen aloft in College Green, 
And a 
Home Rule in Ireland evermore. 
In England they may boast that our Parliament is lost, 
And say that we never should complain; 
Would you have my heart be light when I 
know for this very 
right 
My countrymen are wishing o'er the main? 
Gladstone he may rave, but our country for to save, 
These words they should be heard from shore to shore, 
For O'Connell he did say, before he passed away, 
A Home Rule for Ireland for evermore. 
Hurrah for, etc. 
There's one now in his grave who struggled hard to save 
Our country from oppression long ago, 
Henry Grattan is his name, and may heaven be his gain, 
His energy on Ireland did bestow. 
His voice he never gave our people to enslave, 
Nor drive them to a 
far and distant shore, 
May the flowerlets ever wave upon our hero's grave, 
And a 
Home Rule in Ireland for evermore. 
Hurrah for, etc. 
There's a 
laurel for the brow of the one who's striving now 
To win our Legislature back again, 
John Martin, ever hold our misery to unfold, 
And Ireland for the Irish will maintain. 
But let us all unite to drink this toast to-night, 
May happiness revisit Erin's shore, 
And the plan of Isaac Butts, from the palace to the hut; 
Be a 
Home Rule for Ireland for evermore. 
Hurrah for, eta.

GRANDPA'S chair is vacant, 
Near the fire in the grate, 
Where he told his tales of boyhood— 
Kept the little ones awake; 
One eve, so worn and. weary, 
Sleeping on his knee they 
Death called that night—like the fire bright, 
Grandpa passed. away. 
CHORUS. 
So let the room be cheerful— 
Place the old arm-chair 
Where we talked to grandpa, 
With his silv'ry snow-Iyhite hair; 
How he'd watch the falling ashes, 
And sadly meditate, 
Gently sigh, We all must die, 
Like the fire in the grate. 
One bitter night in winter, 
The snow fell fast and wild; 
A 
girl looked in the window— 
A careworn, hapless child; 
Then grandpa whispered, " Baby," 
And toddled to the gate, 
To save from sin he brought her in, 
Near the fire in the grate. 
So let the room be cheerful, etc. 
Keep the fire burning, 
'Tis charity's bright flame, 
Reminding of the evening 
The orphan Mary came, 
So ragged, cold, and hungry, 
With grandpa from the gate; 
For him she kneels, a 
pray'r she yields, 
Near the fire in the grate. 
So let the room be cheerful, etc.

Reverses in business brought me to a

I 
picked up a

The temptation to keep it was strong. 
My pockets were empty, hut firmly I 
said, 
She shall have her own conic what will;

gave it and said, 
"If you're pour, you're a

THE BUSY B'S. 
An original song, as sung by FRANK LEWIS, with immense success. 
A 
STRANGE name for my song I've selected, 
But still I 
will try you to please; 
They are men of bad deeds been suspected, 
And I'll call them the great Busy B's. 
Now it's simply because that same letter, 
Is the one that commences their name; 
So I 
took it for want of a 
better— 
They are men of renown and great fame. 
CHORUS. 
Now Beelzebub was the first B, sir, 
He made Eve steal the fruit from the tree, sir; 
Caused mankind its shame first to see, sir, 
He was the most wonderful B. 
Belshazzar one day gave a 
dinner, 
And invited his Senators, all ; 
But he found he was scarcely a 
winner, 
When the writing appeared on the wall. 
Brigham Young gets his wives by the hundred, 
He's babies, I'm told, by the score ; 
But not satisfied, the old rascal, 
He is constantly wishing for more. 
CHORUS. 
Ben Butler with one eye does see, sir— 
He goes that same eye on a 
fee, sir— 
He is a 
most comical B, sir, 
That ever this nation did see. 
Mr. Beecher to the people still preaches, 
Giving sly winks at each pretty Miss ; 
Henry Bowen says bad things he teaches, 
He is best at a 
sweet fragrant kiss. 
Spain speaks of apologies given— 
Will that bring the dead back to life 
(1) 
THE BUSY B'S.—Concluded. 
Will that aid the wives and children 
Of thl victims who fell in the strife ? 
CHORUS. 
We want Mira the butcher, on high, sir, 
On a 
gibbet that shall reach to the sky, sir, 
Like the men he has murdered, to die, sir; 
Not till then will we listen to Spain. 
Mr. Blaine is a 
B 
that was Speaker, 
He hails from away down in Maine ; 
For the chair in the White House, a 
seeker, 
No fool of a 
B 
was old Blaine. 
Mr. Babcock, the gay and the frisky, 
Is a 
B 
that went in for the tin ; 
He made his small pile out of whiskey— 
But stealing by law is no sin. 
CHORUS, 
Boss Tweed and Boss Shephard, so great, sir, 
Made cash at a 
tremendous rate, sir; 
Our currency went to inflate, sir— 
These men were such Busy B's. 
But the worst B 
of all in the nation, 
Who late did his pockets well fill— 
Is the one from the poor soldier's ration 
Did steal what he could at Fort Sill. 
Aaron Burr, we are told, was a 
traitor— 
For his country he did not care a 
rap ; 
Though perhaps his proud soul did hate her— 
Was he worse than our General Belknap ? 
CHORUS. 
Such men you'll agree with me, sir, 
Are a 
disgrace to the land of the free, sir; 
'Tis in prison they all ought to be, sir, 
These wonderful great Busy B's.

I'VE just been out to see the boys, 
They invited me to drink, 
Well knowing if we taste life's joys 
We must not stop to think ; 
And that's about the right idea, 
At least I've found it so ; 
To shout and cheer, drink wine and beer, 
No matter where we go; 
To shout and cheer, drink wine and beer, 
No matter where we go. 
CHORUS. 
Then hip, hurrah ! hip, hurrah ! we'll go and have a 
spree, 
Hip, hurrah ! hip, hurrah ! so come along with me, 
Hip, hurrah! hip, hurrah ! let's go and have a 
lark, 
'We never will go home, no, not while it's dark. 
'Tis well for fogies to deny 
The pleasures they forego, 
And tell us that we've got to die, 
We know that to be so ; 
Let them enjoy life as they may, 
And we will do the same ; 
Our spirits light, our hearts are gay, • 
And we'll uphold our name; 
Our spirits light, our hearts are gay, 
And we'll uphold our name. 
Then hip, hurrah, etc. 
I 
care not how the times may go, 
I 
never look for pain ; 
I 
do not choose to search for woe, 
For one I 
do refrain ; 
So come and join me in my spree, 
And have a 
jolly game ; 
We now start iu with one, two, three, 
Hurrah ! we're off again ; 
We now start in with one, two, three, 
Hurrah! we're off again; 
Then hip, hurrah, eta,

SOMETHING THAT OUGHT TO BE DONE. 
MOTTO SONG. 
Sung by FRANK LEWIS with great success. 
Tras world is advancing each moment and hour, 
And startling improvements are made, 
Each nation is striving to gain greater power, 
All others to throw in the shade ; 
And each individual struggles along, 
For he knows that when life is begun, 
To gain great distinction he really must try 
To do something that's never been done. 
This city has many attractions, I 
own, 
But still there is something amiss ; 
The streets and the parks should be kept neat and clean, 
My idea for improvement is this: 
There are plenty of good honest men out of work, 
With hunger and debt overrun, 
they are willing to toil, let us give them the chance, 
It is something that ought to be done. 
Our country is burdened with debt and distress, 
Its people are suffering, too; 
Our finances are in a 
terrible mess, 
And the prospect at present looks blue ; 
There is only one way to prosperity now, 
For corruption has had a 
long run, 
We should have the right man at the head of our land, 
It is something that ought to be done. 
DON'T GET WEARY, CHILDREN. 
Sung with great success by JOHNYY ROACH. 
On, Johnny, you've been a 
bad boy, 
For to treat your true love so, 
And if you don't behave yourself, 
I'll let the old folks know. (

Don't get weary, don't get weary, children, 
Don't get weary, for I's a-going home; 
Don't get weary, don't get weary, children, 
Don't get weary, for I's a-going home. 
cuonus, second. 
When the sun rise in the morning, 
Down by the yellow . corn, 
There we darkeys all take warning, 
When Dina blows the horn. (
Repeat.)

When I'm gone you'll miss me, 
When I'm gone you'll miss me ; 
There is one kind heart will miss me when 
I'm gone, yes, when I'm gone. (
Repeat.) 
Oh, Susie, I've been a 
bad boy, 
But I 
won't do so any more, 
And if you give me your heart and hand, 
Well go to the old Virginia shore. (

Don't get weary,. eto.,

When Pat comes over the hill, his colleen for to see, 
His whistle, loud and shrill, the signal was to be. 
"0 Mary " my mother cries, " there's somebody whistling,

" 
No, mother, its only the wind, that's whistling through the

That's whistling through the door."

I've lived a

But the wind to whistle a

MARY sings. 
But, mother, you know the fiddle hangs just behind the 
chink, 
And the wind upon the strings of it is playing a

The dog is barking now, and a

MARY .
sings. 
But, mother, you know that dogs will bark when they see

MOTHER sings. 
But how can he see the moon, when you know he's old and 
blind; 
Blind dogs can't see the moon, nor fiddles be played by the 
wind, 
Nor fiddles be played by the wind. 
[PAT, outside, imitates a 
pig.] 
MOTHER sings. 
And there now is the pig, oneasy in his mind. 
MARY sings. 
But, mother, you know the saying, that pigs can secs the

MOTHER sings. 
That's all very well in the day, but allow me, miss, to re-
mark 
That pigs, no more than ourselves, can see anything b the 
dark, 
Can see anything in the dark. 
MOTHER.—So, so, my daughter; get out wid your excuses. 
You can't decave your ould mother.

MOTHER.-0h, go 'long wid ye.

Get out, ye whistling thief, and get along home out of that;

THE WHISTLING THIEP.—{CONTINUED.] 
And you, miss, be off to your bed; don't bother me wid yout

PAT (
at window).—Whist, Mary mavourneen I Darlint, aro

MARY.—Yes, Pat; but be aisy, me mother is wide awake. 
PAT.—Oh, bad luck to her—I 
mane, God bless the ould

MARY.—Oh, I

If she does, sure she'll 
be after breaking every bone in your body. 
PAT.—What do you suppose I'd care for that ?

You ought to know better. 
PAT.—Sure, I'll whistle now if you don't stop me mouth

MOTHER.—Is

Sure, yer head's so full of that

Get in wid yer.

[Exit MOTHER and MARY.] 
PAT (
leaning on window-sill). — When I 
come again, bedad, 
I'll come wid a 
still tongue in my head. 
Take my advice:

THE WHISTLING THIEF.—[CONTINUED.] 
PAT sings. 
Now, boys, don't courting go too near to the house, d'ye mind; 
Unless you're certain sure the old woman's both deaf and 
blind; 
The days when they were young, forget they never can, 
They're able to tell the difference 'twixt a 
fiddle, pig, dog 
and a 
man; 
A 
fiddle, pig, dog and a 
man.

I 
Alt thinking to- day 
Of dem years dat passed away, 
When dey tied me up in bondage long ago; 
In old Virginny State, 
It was dar we separate, 
And it 1111'd my heart with misery and 
Dey took away my boy, 
He was his mother's joy ; 
From a 
baby in de cradle we him raise; 
Oh, dey put us far apart, 
Au' it broke de ole man's heart, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slav'ry days. 
CHORUS. 
Dey never come again, 
Let us give our praise to Him 
Who looks down whar de little children play; 
So ev'ry night and morn, 
We will pray for dem dat's gone, 
in dem agonizing, .cruel slav'ry days. 
Still my mem'ry will steal o'er 
To (lat dear old cabin floor, 
When de shadow of de sun came peeping in; 
At night, when -all was dark, 
We would hear de watch- dog bark, 
And we'd listen to de murmur of de wind. 
It seem to say to me, 
" 
You people must be free," 
For de happy thue am coming, Lord be prais'd1 
For then we would weep and moan, 
For our souls was not our own, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slay'ry days. 
Dey never, etc. 
I 
am very old and feeble, 
And our life am nearly done; 
I 
have traveil'd in the roughest kind of road; 
Thro' sickness, toil and sorrow, 
I 
have reach'd de end at last, 
And I'm resting by de wayside wid my load. 
Forget now and forgive, 
Has always been tny guide, 
For dat s 
what de golden Scripture surely says; 
But our rueldry will turn round, 
When our souls dey were tied down, 
in dem agonizing, cruel slav'ry days. 
Dey never, etc. 
PLODDING THROUGH THE RAIN 
Sitting lately at my window 
On a 
rainy day, 
Time I 
whiled away by watching 
All who passed that way. 
From the weather some protected, 
Others moved in pain; 
Some in hunger, cold, neglected, 
Wretched in the rain. 
Plodding, tripping, 
Drenched and dripping, 
Wretched in the rain. 
Postman conies, delivers letters, 
Sorely I'm afraid, 
Of public servants, few are better, 
None so badly paid. 
Men must vary in their station, 
Let him not complain ; 
But heaven keep him from temptation, 
Plodding through the rain. 
Plodding, tripping,. atm 
A female form my eye next catches, 
Carrying a 
child, 
Singing snatches, sellis,g matches, 
See, the infant smiled. 
Still closer nestled to its mother, 
Drops to sleep again ; 
May He befriend them—they've no other. 
Wretched in the rain. 
Plodding, tripping, eta. 
Belief I 
gave them, food and money, 
Speedily they're gone; 
Grim policeman, gaunt and stoney, 
Bids her to move on.

PLODDING THEM:tan THE RAIN.—CONTINVED. 
Duty makes this man suspicious, 
Beggars sigh in vain; 
He thinks all kindness injudicious, 
To paupers in the rain. 
Plodding, tripping, .to. 
Eyes half opened, peeping from an 
Old, uneasy seat, 
Weather-beaten, apple-woman, 
Wherefore in the street ? 
To the gin shop should she totter, 
Just to get a 
drain; 
For such indulgence pray blame not her, 
Sitting in the rain. 
Sitting, slipping, ete. 
See, with pliant step and supple, 
Two folks next appear; 
Watch that loving, courting couple, 
Closer drawing near. 
'Neath one small umbrella walking, 
Whispering love's old strain, 
Heedless of the weather, talking, 
Happy in the rain. 
Trotting, tripping, etc. 
Rest to some men would be hunger, 
hand to mouth they live ; 
Carman, ' busman, oyster dredge; 
Daily have to strive 
Watching life's damp, dreary feature, 
I've not looked in vain, 
If more I 
love my fellow creature, 
Plodding in the rain. 
Plodding, tripping, eta.

MANY CAN HELP ONE. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
SomE very good sayings I've heard in my time, 
And some I 
believe to be true; 
The one I 
will mention to-night in my song 
1.9 one that is well known to you ; 
If you meet a 
man who is down in the world, 
And assistance you can't give him auy, 
Remember that many can always help one, 
Where one cannot always help many. 
CHORUS. 
Then give what you can to those in distress, 
Let it be a 
dime or a 
penny, 
For many can help one, I've heard people say, 
Where one cannot always help many. 
How often a 
trifle would save a 
man's life 
When he is near dying from want; 
He's tried to live honest all through his lifetime, 
But finds in the end that he can't ; 
At last he is tempted to steal or to starve, 
His rich friends they all pass him by, 
They heed not his wishes, they care not his wants, 
He's left like a 
dog there to die. 
Then give what you can, etc. 
A 
man may be wealthy one end of the year, 
The next one be wretched and poor; 
He's struggled his hardest to keep himself up, 
But has sunk down to poverty's door; 
Such men as these deserve your support, 
So give it to them who most need, 
For those who've experienced poverty know 
'Tis a 
very hard battle indeed. 
Then give what you can, etc. 
I 
hope what I've mentioned to-night in my song, 
That nothing I've said out of place; 
A man may be poor, but still honest be. 
For poverty, 'tis no disgrace; 
Then give what you can with a 
generous heart, 
No knowing when the tide it may turn ; 
Just give him a 
chance to rise up in the world, 
And your kindness he's sure to return. 
Then give what you can, etc.

MeCAFFREY'S OLD HORSE. 
Written by JACK CONROY, and given by him to his friend Joirynry R04.011. 
I'm going to sing you a 
ditty, 
I'm sure it will cause you to mile, 
It's about an old horse in the city 
That sticks out his tail in grand style; 
Although the poor creature looks lazy, 
Not a 
horse in the land, I'll go bail, 
Could travel so quick and so easy, 
Providing he got a 
square meal. 
CHORUS. 
He was the horse that could travel, 
Providing you kept him well fed; 
He could trot upon stones or on gravel, 
And make other horses in dread. 
Some say the horse was short-winded, 
Some say he got nothing to eat, 
111ore say he was high-minded, 
And that he was full of conceit ; 
But while the poor horse he was living, 
He eat many a 
bundle of hay; 
But now that he's dead we'll forgive him, 
For a 
horse, like a 
dog, has his day. 
He was the horse,

BIDDY DOYLE., 
Sung by JOHNNY ROACH. 
011 
I 
nave come over here, Biddy Doyle, 
For to tell you pretty clear, Biddy Doyle, 
For to gain your heart and hand, 
As you will understand, 
And to be at your command, Biddy Doyle. 
So I 
will always prove true, 
_No matter what you do, 
And I 
will stick to you like glue, Biddy Doyle' 
Oh! the summer is past and gone, Biddy Doyle, 
And the winter is coming on, Biddy Doyle; 
And the stormy winds will blow, 
It will hail, rain and snow. 
And what will become of you, Biddy Doyle, 
What will you do at all, 
When the snow begins to fall, 
With your back against the wall, Biddy Doyle 
You know how it is yourself, Biddy Doyle, 
You will soon be on the shelf, Biddy Doyle; 
You know you are old enough, 
And your face is getting rough, 
Another year will make you tough, Biddy Doyle. 
So leave off your lamentation, 
And increase the population, 
Or you are not worthy of your nation, Biddy Doyle. 
Oh ! when I 
go on a 
spree, Biddy Doyle, 
I 
will raise lots of fun, you'll see, Biddy Doyle; 
If I 
should come home tight, 
Don't try to raise a 
fight, 
Or I'll give you a 
box that will make you quiet, Biddy Doyle; 
Don't call the neighbors around me, 
Or if you do I'll surely pound you, 
And I 
will spit on you and drown you, Biddy Doyle.

DISSOLVING VIEWS. 
Composed and sang by GEORGE HARRIS, English Comte, and given by him 
to JOHNNY Roca. 
Am.—" Castles in the Air." 
W HILE thinking of some past events at home the other night, 
Seated at my cheerful fire, which then was burning bright, 
At last the fire began to fade—a 
shadow o'er it grew; 
I 
fancied I 
was looking at some great dissolving view; 
Some views there were that gave me joy, while others gave me 
pain; 
Oh, may I 
never see them in reality again; 
So give me your attention, and I'll quickly tell to you 
Some pictures that I 
witnessed in my great dissolving view. 
The first view was of sad distress, a 
truly wretched case; 
The family of a 
workingman, hunger stared them in the face; 
The mother and their children gathered round a 
scanty fire, 
The last spatks even threatening every moment to expire; 
At last the father enters, and lianas his honest head, 
And silently he shares with them his last loaf of bread; 
Though honest, be is forced to steal, and into jail he's threw; 
This sad and truthful picture is my second disselving view. 
The next was a 
police court; two prisoners in were led; 
One, a 
well-dressed swindler, and the other a 
boy ill- fed; 
The boy had stolen, and confessed his guilt, and for pardon 
did entreat; 
He said, " I 
am an orphan boy, and nothing had to eat ;" 
Three months hard labor was his doom— the tears ran down 
his face; 
While lie who swindled many a 
man walked out with a 
good 
grace; 
He paid for counsel with his spoil—his money put him through, 
That ends the case, and he gets free in this dissolving view. 
The third it was a 
murder cold, a 
tragic one, I'm sure; 
It was a 
man of manly beart, and a 
good friend to the poor, 
Shot down by an assassin dastardly and cold; 
But shooting men quite unawares is the fashion now, I'm told; 
The murder of Jim Fisk, I 
mean, a 
man known to you all; 
In this wide world he played his part, and rolling kept the ball; 
E 
hope his spirit's gone aloft, I 
most sincerely do, 
ever more to rest in peace in this dissolving view.

2HEY ALI. 
DO IT. 
AS 
sung by Toii PASTOR. 
SOME folks will cry, " Oh, shame, Mr. Jones, you are to 
blame; 
I 
never should have thought it, sir, of you ;" 
While if they'd look at home, before abroad they'd roam, 
I'm positive they'd have enough to do. 
Mr. Brown says it's a 
sin that Mr. Smith drinks gin, 
And harbors all the gang from day to day; 
When Mr. Green was caught doing what he didn't ought, 
When he in self-defence was heard to say--
CHORUS. 
They all do it, they all do it, 
They all do it, though oft-times they rue it; 
Yet they all do it, they all do it, 
And so it will continue to the end of the world. 
For hours three or four lovers spooning at the door 
On any pleasant morning may be seen; 
And if they have a 
kiss 'twill never come amiss, 
And they enjoy it, though they say they didn't mean; 
When creeping down the stairs comes the old man un-
awares, 
And kissing catches the couple in the act, 
The mother from above says, " Don't interfere, my love, 
You can't dispute this most important fact—" 
They all do it, etc. 
Old women do declare girls should never dye their hair, 
And then again they say it's very nice, 
Without the least restraint, their faces so to paint, 
And rob the cats and dogs of all their mice; 
(1) 
45 
THEY ALL DO IT.—Concluded. 
Each girl a 
little " puff " has inside a 
seal-skin muff, 
They are never seen without it, night or day; 
And her " turnup 
nose she'll powder, if a 
moment is 
allowed her, 
When, if you laugh, she'll innocently say— 
They all do it, etc. 
But what does most impress is the style in which they 
dress; 
It's enough to make you laugh when them you see; 
They've a 
bat upon their heads large enough to make up 
beds 
For " pussy " cats with kittens two or three ; 
In their paniers too behind, if examined, you will find 
The most important papers of the day; 
The " Clipper," if you chose, the " Herald," and the 
" 
News," 
Or anything that chance puts in their way. 
They all do it, etc. 
There's my neighbor, Mrs. West, who's expensive in her 
dress, 
And her husband only gets nine dollars every week; 
I've often heard him say, " If things go on this way, 
We'll a 
lodging in the station have to seek, 
For the doctor and the nurse will drain my scanty purse, 
With many more expenses to defray; 
Then he gets into a 
passion when they tell him it's the 
fashion, 
And they soothe him when they sing this truthful lay— 
For they all do it, etc.

W E 
started for the fair, 
With spirits light and hearty, 
Behind McCarthy's mare; 
Oh, it was a 
lively party! 
You never saw the likes of it, 
Believe me what I 
say! 
Sure we had a 
roaring racket, 
But the mare she ran away. 
Off she whit! off she wint! 
Be gob, I 
wasn't worth a 
chit I 
The sate was jist as hard as flint, 
Behind McCarthy's mare. 
CHORUS. 
"Hould her in!" McCarthy cried; 
" 
Stop her!" says McCue; 
I 
thought I'd shake to pieces 
As along the road we flew! 
Me bead was swimming like a 
top, 
My heart was in despair, 
The divil himself was in the wheels 
Behind McCarthy's mare. 
McCarthy held the reins, 
And Murphy held McCarthy, 
But whiskey filled their brains, 
And made them wild and hearty; 
Maloney tumbled out behind, 
And there we let him lay----
Sure I 
offered to assist him, 
But the mare she ran away. 
Off she whit! off she wint! 
Be gob. I 
wasn't worth a 
cint 
The sate was jist as hard as flint, 
Behind McCarthy's mare.

THE RUNAWAY KARR—Concluded.

Sure mesilf was kilt intirely, 
With the mare that run away.

Something tells me I

Do not weep, dear loving mother, 
Sad am Ito cause you pain; 
But something tells me I 
shall never 
See the summer tlow'rs again. 
How I 
lev'd alone to wander 
In the happy days long flown, 
O'er field and meadow fair, to gather 
Bright-hued blossoms freshly blown ; 
Soon beside the rippling river, 
Winding onward o'er the plain. 
The buds will burst, but I 
shall never 
See the summer tlow'rs again.

The first on the page is little Sally Sage, 
She once was a 
lady's maid; 
But she ran away on a 
very dark day, 
With a 
fellow in the fried fish trade. 
The next was a 
Cook, oh! a 
beauty with a 
hook, 
And I'll tell you the reason why! 
For a 
leg she'd a 
stump, on her back was a 
hump, 
And she'd got a 
little squint in her eye !-Cno. 
3 
Another one to charm was a 
Girl on a 
farm, 
Well versed in the harrows arid ploughs; 
She guarded the rigs of a 
lot of little pigs, 
And squeezed new milk from the Cows. 
She was sixteen stone all muscle and bone, 
And she looked with an awful leer; 
And she would have been mine, but fell in a 
decline, 
Thro' swallowing a 
mouse in her beer !- Cno. 
4 
Then another one came, al. a 
right jolly Dame, 
And her purse was as long as my arm, 
All full of yellow gold, such a 
sight to behold! 
Would the heart of a 
miser warm. 
And her only sin was a 
love for gin, 
But it brought our hopes to a 
wreck; 
For she slipp'd with her heel on a 
bit of orange peel, 
Fell down and broke her blessed neck.- Cno. 
5 
I 
could add to the score full a 
half dozen more, 
For the list is a 
long way round; 
One went o'er the sea for a 
better chap than me, 
And some of them were hanged or drowned. 
And the last I 
had through drink went mad, 
In vain I 
tried to stop her: 
And sad was my dismay to discover that one day, 
She'd been slowly boiled to death in the Copper. 
Ono. 
W HY DIDN 'T Y air SAY SO ZEPORE. 
As sag by Gus W ILLIAms. 
New by-words you know now-a-days, are the rage, 
You'll hear them from every tongue; 
Wherever you go you'll find that it's so, 
The little, the big, old and young; 
Even the ladies are fond of the slang, 
While the boys in the street loudly roar, 
Oh, how they do shout, the latest one out, 
Why didn't you say so before ! 
One day driven road with a 
toothache so bad, 
I 
rushed to the first doctor's shop, 
When the grinder he eyed and the tongs he appliAcl, 
And he pulled me six times round the shop; 
Said I, when he'd done, you've pulled out the wrong one, 
While with agony loud I 
did roar; 
Now it's done, sir, says he, the fault don't lay with rre ; 
Why didn't you say so before 
I 
once asked a 
friend me ten dollars to lend, 
And said : I'd return it next day. 
When he did begin at once to rub his chin, 
And these words, unto me he did say; 
Old boy, it's too bad, I 
should have been glad, 
In fact, I'd have let you have more 
Had you called yesterday,— now, its all paid away, 
Why didn't you say so before! 
My wife yesterday sat crying away, 
Because our first-born was a 
boy; 
All day she would sigh and keep rubbing her eye, 
instead of being happy -7ith joy ; 
Says she to me, Joe, I 
hate boys, you know, 
soone, of girls have a 
score; 
Bays I (with a 
leer) it's too late, now, my dear, 
Why didn't you say so before

THE TIPPERARY MEN. 
Oa, THE ROLLICKING IRISHMAN. 
Sung by JoHNNt ROACH. 
So, boys, I'm here once more you see, and a 
story I'm going to 
tell; 
It's something new between, me and you, which an Irishman 
befell ; 
'Twas in the town of Liverpool, in a 
street I 
forget the name, 
But to pass the time in the chorus join, just while I 
sing the 
same. 
CHORUS. 
His name was Pat—just think of that! awl beat it if you can; 
There's none so gay, both night and day, as a 
rollicking Irish-
man; 
Whack, whack, whack, burro°, tiddy I 
dow de dow, 
Whack, whack, whack, hurroo, tiddy I 
dow de dow; 
Oh, at a 
wake or a 
fair we're always there, the Tipperary men. 
Now the weather was cold, and this hero bold about for work 
did seek; 
He got a 
job to carry bricks at eighteen shillings a 
week; 
He bought a 
hod for half a 
crown from a 
man named Mickey 
Burke, 
And Pat so gay the very next day at six o'clock went to work. 
His name was Pat, etc. 
They were building a 
house—'twas very high, but Pat didn't 
care a 
jot; 
To his work got drilled, when his hod was filled, how quick up 
the ladder he'd trot ; 
He was going to the top about twelve o'clock, but whether ' twas 
frost or the rum, 
This hero bold he missed his hold, and down he came by the 
run. 
His name was Pat, etc. 
Now, as Pat down did go, he put his hand so, and then a 
loud 
yell be gave; 
He cried, " Och hone!" as down he came; " may the Lord my 
poor soul save!" 
He turned o'er and o'er when he reached the first floor, on his 
feet he then tried to jump, 
But his head first came down, and when near the ground he 
cried, " Now for a 
thundering bump I" 
His name was Pat, etc

Composed by DANIEL McGerry, and given by him to JOHNNY Bolos, as 
a 
token of respect. 
Ain.—" Irish Molly, 01" 
Pm Paddy Miles, an Irish boy, just come across the sea; 
For singing or for dancing, boys, I 
think that I'll please ye; 
I 
can sing and dance with any man, as I 
did in days of yore, 
And on Patrick's day I 
love to wear the hat rue father wore. 
CHORUS. 
It's old, but it's beautiful—the best you ever seen; 
'Twas worn for more than ninety years in that little Isle so green, 
From my father's great ancestors it descended with gallore— 
It's a 
relic of old dacency, is the hat me father wore. 
I 
bid you all good evening—good luck to you, I 
say, 
And when I 
cross the ocean I 
hope for me you'll pray; 
I'm going to my happy land in a 
place called Ballymore, 
To be welcomed back to Paddy's land with the hat me father 
wore. 
It's old, etc. 
And when I 
do return again the boys and girls to see, 
I 
hope that with old Erin's style you'll kindly welcome me, 
With the songs of dear old Ireland to cheer me more and more, 
And make me Irish heart feel glad with the hat me father wore. 
It's old, etc.

Now let others take the rear, 
We're coming solid to the front, 
Of that don't have a 
fear ; 
The Mulligan's, the Hoolahan's, 
The Dougherty's and all, 
When we're paradin' thro' the streets, 
We drive them to the wall. 
CHORUS. 
First the left and then the right, 
But never both together; 
The tall, the short, the thick, the thin, 
We're worse, begob, than leather ; 
As we're paradin' thro' the streets, 
I 
tell you we're the cards, 
We're bound to be the Hummers, 
We're the Donegan Light Guard I 
So now we are the darlings, 
On that you may bet high, 
'We have a 
prize for every man, 
And forty more besides. 
We don't mix with the common ones, 
For ourselves we have regard, 
We are " A One" above the crowd, 
We're the Donegan Light Guard! 
First the left, etc. 
Then you should come and see us 
As we march down Broadway ; 
They are a 
gallant lot of men, 
I'm sure we'll hear you say. 
The " Seventh " come and gaze at us, 
And then they beat retreat; 
It's no use, boys, they give it up, 
They know we can't be beat! 
First the left, etc.

WILL YOU EVER SHOOT THAT HAT ? 
Composed and sung by JOHRNT Itoecn. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1874, by JOHNNY ROAMS, 
in the office of the Librarian of Congress, Washington, D. C. 
Ain.—" My Love Nell." 
MY 
name is Mike McClusky, from Ireland I 
came, 
And I've declared my intentions as an American citizen ; 
I'm proud of my ancestors, for I 
came from the rale old stock, 
And on Patrick's day we march away and parade with our old 
hats. 
CHORLIS. 
When the baud does play we march away, the Kerrigans, the 
O's, and Macks, 
And the boys all shout, when we turn out, " Will you ever shoot 
that at?" 
This hat was made for a 
cousin of mine in seventeen ninety-
eight, 
And when he died he left it to me, so it will never be out of 
date. 
It's travelled the wide says over, from Ireland to America, 
And it's seen to the best advantage upon St. Patrick's day. 
When the band does play, etc. 
Then come, brave boys, and join with us before it is too late, 
And we'll all turn out on Patrick's day, and that day we'll cele-
brate 
In honor of our native land, that land we wish was free; 
We invite all true-bred Irishmen to join in our company. 
When the band doe3 play, etc.

DANNY, 
GO AFTER YOUR FATHER. 
Sung with great success by JAMES BRADLEY. 
I'M Mrs. ° Malley, Roger's wife, 
lie is very fond of drink ; 
From Monday morning till Saturday night 
Of nothing else he'll think, 
But go down to the corner store, 
Throw dice and play the cards; 
Instead of bringing his money home, 
He spends it on all the blackguards. 
CHORUS. 
Danny, go after your father, 
He is down in the corner store, 
Playing forty-fives with the Dutchman— 
Against it he often swore; 
• 
Tell him come home to his supper, 
I 
know it will save his life ; 
So that's a 
good lad, 
Go after your dad, 
And tell him come home to his wife. 
Sometimes he takes the pledge, my boys, 
And he keeps it for a 
week, 
Until Saturday night comes over his head, 
To the Dutchman's down he'll sneak; 
He makes believe he is going for coal, 
And through the side door he'll steal, 
He calls out to the bartender, 
Give me a 
big mug of ale! 
Danny, go after, etc. 
Now, dear friends, he's keeping straight, 
And he never leaves the house; 
He sits down by the fire 
And reads his book, just like any mouse; 
I 
tell you we are happy, 
Around the house there's peace ; 
But I 
understand there's an alderman 
Going to put him upon the police. 
Danny, go after, etc.

WHAT should make thee sad, my darling ? 
Why those pearly tears I 
see? 
Have I 
caused one thought of sorrow 1 
Have I 
not been kind to thee ? 
By the stars that shine above us, 
By their wondrous mystery, 
By this heart that beats within me, 
Still I 
love thee, love but thee. 
What should make thee sad, my darling 
Why those pearly tears I 
see, 
Have I 
caused one thought of sox row 1 
Have I 
not been kind to thee 
O'er the bosom of the ocean 
Shall the sea- bird cease to rove, 
Sun and stars shall cease their motion, 
Winds and clouds forget to move, 
E'er my love for thee shall falter, 
Or my faith forgotten be; 
All things else on earth may alter, 
Still I 
love thee, love but thee. 
What should make thee sad, etc. 
Joyfully when first I 
found thee, 
Bowed my soul at love's behest; 
Now when sorrows gather round me, 
Thou alone can'st make me blest 
Be my heart thy throne forever, 
Let all tears forgotten be, 
Weal or woe estrange us never, 
Still I 
love thee, love but thee. 
What should make thee sad, etc.

YOU CAN 
CAN DO IT IF YOU WANT TO. 
Words and Music by GEORGE G. 
Rear. 
The Music of this song is published by E. IL laannic, 229 Bowery, Neu 
York. 
Price 10 cents. 
I 
oxen was deep in love with a 
charming little dear, 
And when in her society I 
always felt so queer, 
I 
muster'd up my cheek, anti asked her for a 
kiss, 
She blush'd and hesitated, and answered me like this: 
cnonus. 
Yon can do it if you want to, 
For I 
really can't resist you, 
You are such Ucharming fellow, 
To refuse you is absurd. 
As time pass'd on, I 
found I'd have to get a 
wife, 
I 
ask'd her if she'd like to be my better half Liao' life"! 
Her answer it was yes, so to papa I 
went, 
And as I'd money plenty, why, he quickly gave consent. 
SPoREN.—Yes, I 
was pretty well fixed, as I 
asked the " Old 
Gent" for his daughter's hand, heart, and so forth, and he says : 
" 
Well, I've no objection ofcourse; you know " Galatea" hasn't 
any money—but as long aci you love her, why, that don't make 
any difference—and as to warrying he", my dear boy, why "— 
You can do it, etc. 
I 
went with rapid steps to tell her of my plan, 
And found her sitting on the lap of a 
handsome looking man, 
I 
scarce believ'd my ryes and started with dismay, 
And as he whispered in her ear, I 
plainly heard her say— 
SPOKEN.—" Never mind, Charley; even if I 
do marry that 
" 
Snoozer," it wor.'t make any difference, I'll love you just the 
same as ever." 
Jeems-es River! wasn't I 
mad—I 
told her she 
was false to me, and that I 
never would marry her—that I 
would 
not believe 11 ,4r even if she'd make a statement—and as for her 
" 
ChP.riey," why, he could have her and welcome. I 
told her I 
would '.e 
are, and she should never set eyes on me again—and 
" 
I :lope I 
may never" if she didn't say— 
You can do it, etc. 
The moral of my tale you all can plainly see, 
Dan't marry any girl, my boys, tho' handsome she may be, 
Unless she loves but you, I 
guess you'll find I'm rioht, 
They're bound to have a " Charley" when you are out of sight. 
SPOKEN. — Yes, and all I've got to say is, if any of you chaps 
want to marry such a 
girl as that, why— 
You can do it, etc.
