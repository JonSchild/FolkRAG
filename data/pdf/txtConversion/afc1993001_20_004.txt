Final report: Marsha Penti
 
June 30, 1982
 
Taunton, Massachusetts, is located in a major area of Por-
tuguese settlement.  Eastern Massachusetts, particularly south-
eastern Massachusetts, along wi t
h
. adjacent Rhode Island has
 
been the site of substantial Portuguese settlement since the
 
nineteenth century (Pap 1981:14.6).  In terms of both actual
 
population and the percentage of total resident population,
 
Massachusetts is known as the dominant state of Portuguese
 
settlement in the United States (Rogers 1980:819),  New Bed-
ford and
. Fall River to the south of Taunton are well-known
 
as the largest Portuguese com m
unities in the United States,
 
but Taunton with its approximate total population of 45,000
 
(The World Almanac Book of Facts 1982:218) has been the third
 
major Portuguese a
 omunini ty within this Bris tol County area
 
since before World War I (Pap 1981: 81
4
.).  Informants in this
 
study estimated the Portuguese (American born of Portuguese
 
parentage and
, actual Portuguese immigrants) in the city to
 
number from fifty to sixty percent of this total population.
 
The Taunton Portuguese community has grown dramatically in the
 
past two decades as a result of a recent wave of mass Portu-
guese immigration.  Older comrrninity members remembered the
 
days when the Portuguese in Taunton were a minority ethnic
 
community; in 1960, for example, the Portuguese population was
 
5,695 (Pap 1981:8S).
 Today the Portuguese form the largest
 
ethnic co m
munity in the city and the existence of a s
izeable
 
community base is a prime reason why the Escola Oficializada
  
Do Taunton Sports ,Club was founded in 1980.  The present 62

student enrollment and the new classroom addition testify to
 
the success of this Portuguese school.  Fieldwork served to
 
indicate reasons not only for the accomplishments of this
 
school, but also for its raison d'e
'tre. Conclusions are based
 
on interviews with school administrators, the coordinator for
 
the Portuguese Ministry of Education in the United States,
 
parents, teachers, and students.  The fieldworLcer made seven
 
visits to the school (three class sessions, one teachers' meet-
ing with the coordinator, Day of Portugal festivities and
 
parents interviews, a photographic session,  and graduation)
 
and also conducted two in-depth interviews with the
 
of the school and the principal in their homes.
 
The Taunton Portuguese school is sponsored by the Taunton
 
Sports Club  and is housed in an addition to the club building
 
which is located in the  "Weir Village" section on the south side
 
of Taunton.  As its name suggests, this club is based on athletics,
 
namely soccer.  Apparently a concern with soccer is a consistent
 
feature of Portuguese coim
iiunities throughout the world and nu-
merou  Portuguese soccer clubs exist in the United States.
 
Taunton Sports sponsors three soccer teams -
 the Portuguese
 
school team, a junior team, and an adult team which plays in
 
the First Division of L
LSA, the thso-American league.  A new
 
soccer field whose fences advertise a myriad of local Portuguese
 
businesses,  is located adjacent to the club building.  The
 
soccer season runs from April until November with competition
 
coming from a variety of taams in the Massachusetts, Rhode
 
Island area.
 
Each night the school was visited there was a large number
 
of cars in the parki ng  lot.

t only were these the cars of
 
soccer players, but also of m di-
of club facilities such as the
 
fully licensed downstairs bar or of functiox jn the club hail.
 
Functions of the club include periodic fund-raising dinners
 
where Portuguese dishes such as cam e alentejana are serve
d; 
those often are accom pan i ed by a dance.  On weekends the bar's
 
kitchen is open and serves "
snacks" such as l
inguica sandwiches.

It is the club dinners and dances that members' wives attend.
 
Antonio Amaral, president of the school and former president
 
of the club explained why no women were active in the club:
 
"Portuguese women usually never get involved in social affairs.
 
To them it's not right for a lady to go into a club.  The Ameri-
can way is different.  We have a POrtuguese-American club here
 
in town which has
. an auxiliary group composed of ladies; but
 
the i rn1 g r a nt s  normally, I'm not saying generally but normally,
 
they don't believe in women socializing into clubs l
ike that.
 
We would like to and we try to /Eave them participat 7, but they
 
just don't go."
 
The club also sponsors some calendrical celebrations.  In
 
february before Lent there is a camnaval dance at the ci
 
when participants dress in costumes.  Special dances are
 
formed and there is a special group of camnavaj performers
 
from the club who sing humorous, entertaining lyrics.  During
 
the summer there is also a festa in the Portuguese tradition
 
on the club grounds where ethnic foods are served,  the club's
 
folklore group perf
:orm , and the;e is general dancing for the
 
public.  At Christmas there is a party for school students and
 
Penti 6/30/82
 
children of club members where ch
ildren under l3 receive a gift
 
on behalf of the club.
 
The club attendance on weekday nights and club activities
 
indicate the vital role of the Taunton Sports Club in the local
 
comzrn.u.ity,
 The club building is not announced by any large
 
sign.  There is no sign on the club building itself;  the 01117
 
marker is a small, unobtrusive sign high on a telephone pole
 
at the edge of the highway.
 The club obviously is well-known
 
by and serves the local conmiuni ty.
 The original building is
 
said t
o have been built in 1941 as the South End Portuguese
 
Club, also known as the Baker Road Club; as a result of a lack
 
of support it was sold after the war and functioned as a Knights
 
of Columbus hail for many years before returning to function as
 
a Portuguese club.
 
HistorT of the Taunton Sports Club  
The Taunton Sports Club began simply as a soccer team in 1959,
 
being affiliated with the Ward 5
 Athletic Club.
 In 1961 the team
 
became independent renting its own club on Weir St; eventually,
 
about ten years ago,  the club purchased its own building on
 
Oak St.  (later sold to the Taunton Eagles) and finally in 1 78
 
the club purchased its present building on Baker Road.  Original-
ly the club had served a varied community.  Antonio Amaral, for-
mer '
Taunton Sports president described the situation: "In those
 
days we were interested only in soccer and then we developed
 
into a soc ial and civic club; cause the majority of our members
 
were Portuguese we went that way.
 The reason we put the name
 
'Taunton Sports' when we left Ward 5
 was to attract American
 
youth to soccer in those days; but we didn't accomplish our
 
Penti 6/30/82
 
goal.  In those days they didn't even play soccer in the schools
 
those days.... We're not sorry we used the name  'Taunton 5p0rts'
 
but if we anew this, we would probably get a more et
hrr c name to
 
it, because on the other hand
 suffered by using this name
 
in that a lot of our people don't realize we're Portuguese.'
 
There are approximately 300 dues-paying members of the Taunton
 
Sports Club; a larger number 
-is said to avail itself of club ac-
tivities.  According to Antonio
: .
Amaral, the membership is  "one
 
hundred percent Portuguese immigrants."  while many Portuguese
 
clubs in America, particularly in nearby New Bedford and Fall
 
River, are defined by regional Portuguese origins,
 Taunton Sports
 
has a membership representing all areas of Portugal -
 conti-
nenta3. Portugal, the Azores, the Madeiras, and even the former
 
territory of Angola.  There appears to be a general consensus
 
that such a varied membership is preferable in that it alleviates
 
discrimination (
even non-Portuguese can join
, unlike, it was noted,
 
the POrtuguese- American Civic Club where Portuguese descent or
 
marriage to a Portuguese is require for membership) and allows
 
for greater community cooperation.
 The club's immigrant mem:-
ship has served to determine the functions of the club.  All
 
members spoken to in the course of fieldwork were immigrants,
 
typically recent immigrants and Portuguese was  the language heard
 
at the club.
 The other major Portuguese social club in the city,
 
the Portuguese-Ame rican Civic Club (pAcc), is described as di-
recting its attention towards the Portuguese born in America,
 
the "Luso-Americans." As the local Portuguese community grew
 
with the influx of new immigrants, Taunton Sports apparently as-
sumed the role of serving this Portugal-born part of the coin-
enti 6/30/82
 
munity.  While both clubs share certain responsibilities t
o
wards S
 
the ethnic coru
iinity (for example,  the recent Day of Portugal
 
dinner was held in what was described as the  "beautiful" PACC
 
hail), each club appears to derive its support from separate
 
segments of the coinriunity.
 The distinction between new and old
 
immigrants was described by Antonio Amaral who himself came to
 
America in 1959
: "So we had the difference between the old and
 
the new generations here.  Also the old Liso-Americans or Por-
tuguese they had tough times here, you know.  After the reces-
sion /epressionJ in 1922 or whatever,  they had it tough here
 
and they didn't have the facilities,  the easy way that the new
 
immigrants had facilities in going to school and facilities in
 
getting jobs and so forth.  So they did resent their part and
 
often they say '
Gee, you people had it made.
 When we came, we
 
didn't have this, we didn't have that and now you people come
 
in and buy a
. house, buy  an automobile after a year.' And they're
 
kind of jealous inside of it and also the new generation that
 
came, let's say in the sixties, are more educated, more culture
 
inclined than those who came in the twenties due to the times
 
actually.
 In the Old Country they had, we had, a campaign also
 
against illiterate people and at one time Salazar made even
 
adults go to school, which was good, and many, many years ago
 
they used to come without knowing how to read and write and that
 
made a big difference.
 Today it's not so and everyone comes
 
S
 
with a basic knowledge of things and they resent those things
 
actually.
 Another thing we are hard workers and everybody buys 5
 
a house after a few years. and paint it and renovate it and they
 
do everything possible and that's it."
 
renti 6/30/82
 
.he Taunton Sports Club has come to serve the i
rii.grant
 
Portuguese community in the last two decades.
 In addition to
 
the soccer teams, the club sponsors, as part of its cultural
 
emphasis, a folklore group, Rancho Folclo'rico do Taunton Sports. 
This group under the direction of Isaura Amara]. (
sister of school
 
president, Antonio Amaral, and of club president, Jose Amaral),
 
performs traditional dances from throughout Portugal (again re-
flective of club membership as opposed to other area folklore
 
groups which concentrate on- dances of one particular region)
 
supported by its own band.  This group is invited to perform at
 
various Portuguese festas and functions in the area as well as
 
at non-Portuguese events such a9 icnics of local businesses.
 
This group and the soccer team  
s
 effectively serve t
o represent
 
Taunton Sports throughout the region.
 The service towards the
 
immigrant community led the club to initiate a Portuguese school.
 
The PACC might also have been a suitable location for such a
 
school; but it was noted "They're more into America
.
,, than we are;
 
not that we have anything against America."
 
The Taunton Portuguese Community
  
Before proceeding to a discussion of the school itself,  some
 
understanding of the 'aunton Portuguese community and
, its insti-
tutions must be provided since the school is community based.
 
It was emphasized repeatedly that today the Portuguese live
 
throughout the city without evidencing Old Country regional af-
filiations.
 Yet there remains a major traditional area of Por-
tuguese settlement called "The Portuguese Village" or simply
 
"The Village."  It is located in the School Street area north
 
of the city center,  in this area are to be found the PACC
 
building,  several Portuguese markets (
such as Mates Variety and
 
Pen
.ti 6/30/82
 
Joe s Superette) and other businesses, and St. Anthony,  the main
 
Portuguese parish.  Portuguese throughout the city, particularly
 
those not fluent in English,  attend this church.  Another Por -
tuguese church, Our Lady of Lourdes, is located in the "Weir
 
Village,"  which was another traditional area of Portuguese
 
settlement south of the city center.  The Taunton Sports Club
 
is located in this section; in the early 1940s the building was
 
constructed as the "South Side Portuguese Club."  There are also
 
Portuguese markets in this area such as Andrade's Market.
 Through-
out the city, including Main Street in the city center, Portuguese
 
businesses are located.  As the Portuguese presence in the city
 
is visible to the casual observer, it serves as an indication
 
of Portuguese strength in the city. The .
instituthns serve to
 
support certain Portuguese traditiona.  If food is to be taken
 
as an example, it can be seen that traditional elements of the
 
Portuguese diet are easily found in a variety of local Portuguese
 
stores as well a
s in standard "American" chains.  Here are sold
 
products manufactured in the United States such as lingui a and
 
a myriad of bakery products and also foods imported from the
 
homeland which include  non-perishables such as dried fruits and
 
at least a dozen types of canned sardines as well as perishables
 
such as fresh fish and fruit flown in from Portugal.
 
In addition to the Taunton Sports Club there are several other
 
Portuguese clubs in the city.  The Portuguese-American Civic Club
 
is the largest with approximately five to six hundred members.
 
The smallest club with a membership under a hundred is the Taunto
 
aglss, a soccer club which developed out of Taunton Sports. There
 
is q religious club,  the Holy Ghost Club, in East Taunton with
 
enti S/3O/82
 
-9-
 
approximately one hundred members.
 The most recent organiza-
tion founded in Taunton (in 1981 with
. approximately 120 members)
 
to promote Portuguese culture, both within and outside the ethnic
 
coirTnull
t y,  is TOPAC  (Taunton Organization for the Portuguese-
American Conmiunity) which ass
is t
s aawly arrived immigrants wi t h,
 
for example, citizenship classes.  Memb ership in these clubs is
 
non-exclusive and Taunton Sports members may be members of other
 
clubs •
 The Portuguese Continental Union, a national Portuguese
 
organization, also has a Taunton lodge.
 
A major aspect of community life occurs during the summer.
 
e3 a5 crowd the summer weekend calendar.  A festa may be a
 
simple picnic without calendrital or historical significance
 
or it may be a festival based it religious meaning. Duri ng
 
every weekend in June, July, and August there appears to be a
 
festa in Taunton or the surrounding southern New  ng1and area.
 
Families attend not only the local festas, but also travel to
 
ones some distance away •
 The major Taunton festa is St. Anthonyt a
 
held under the sponsorship of the local parish of the same name.
 
This -festa consists of a mass in the ehurch followed by a reli-
gious procession through the surrounding streets of the Portu-
guese village and afterwards there is a secular segment where,
 
for example,  ethnic and
. American foods are sold and carnival
 
events are available.
 Our Lady of Lourdes also has its own festa
 
held in June.  The Holy Ghost Club has its own religious festa
 
in July.
 The Taunton Sports Club, as mentioned holds its own
 
feata in July.
 
he major secular celebration of the year occurred during the
 
course of this fieldwork; it is the "Day of Portugal" which
 
Pentj 6/30/82
 
-10-
honors Portuguese culture under the aegis of a commemoration
 
of LLs De Ca
es, the great Portuguese poet.
 The actual
 
holiday occurs on June tenth, but the occasion is marked by
 
week long festivities which began. in Taunton this year with
 
a flag-raising ceremony on Taunton Green in the city center
, which
 
was
. followed by an art show for local Portuguese artists,  on
 
Saturday June 5 (rain did force a change in schedule).
 On
 
Sunday a festa  was held in the Portuguese Village where there
 
were performances by the Rancho Folclorico do Taunton Soorts
 
and four other invited folklore groups from southeastern Massachu-
setts and
. Rhode Island.
 On Wednesday there were three soccer
 
games held in the evening at the Taunton Sports field where the
 
club's three teams participated.  Finally on Thursday, June 10,
 
the major event of a dinner and fado performance was held at the
 
PACC.  The school children commemorated the occasion through an
 
end of the yaer project of essays and drawings.
 
The Taunton Portuguese have a variety of occupations.
 'he
 
city's factories (primarily silver, clothing,  and shoe) offer
 
employment to many.  Antonio Amaral described the immigrant work
 
cycle which was also represented in his own life: "We have to
 
go to the factory; cause that's the first step of everyone's
 
life.  And from there they' try to better themselves by going
 
to some other school, some other college like my sister [ a
 
bilingual teache!% did.  And then they try to better themselves
 
by going into business or getting another job getting out of the
 
factories."
 any Taunton Portuguese appear to have sought self-
employment as evidenced by the large number of small Portuguese
 
owned markets, garages, travel agencies, furniture stores,

Eistoi7- of the Taunton Portuguese School
  
Against this vigorous Portuguese community baci grcund,  the
 
Portuguese school was rounded in 1980.  Antonio Amaral, presi-
dent of the school since its inception, apparently played an
 
integral role in the creation of the school.  Amaral noted that
 
he had thought' of founding a school when he was Taunton
. Sports
 
Club president in the mid-1970s (he has been a club member for
 
over 20 years), but the lack of proper facilities at the Oak
 
Street club building prevented this.  t
Le described his interest
 
in a Portuguese school as natural with four children; he wanted
 
his children to "learn my culture, language, and background in
 
an academic way."  An organizational meeting was held during
 
late winter of 1980 (February or March) to discuss the feasi-
bility of the school assessing the means of operation
, and the
 
number of students possible.  Attending this meeting were ap-
proximately 25 parents and
, other interested people including
 
some invited guests.  These included directors and officers of
 
the Taunton Sports Club as well as are bilingual t
eachers who
 
were called in ror experienced guidance.  These teachers in-
cluded Josel n
.o Guerreiro who has continued her interest as
 
present school secretary and 'saura Amaral, director of bot
 
the club's and the school's folklore group.
 Ironically, des-
pite their expertise in language education,  these bilingual
 
teachers on the basis of their American education are not con-
sidered qualified to teach in the Portuguese school.
 
It was decided to  a
'the Taunton school an official school

ng support and recognition

from the Portuguese Ninistry of .
Education.
 This involvement
 
of the Portuguese government in the operation of Portuguese
 
ethnic schools is somewhat unique.
 The Portuguese government
 
through the Ministry of Education
. offers an aid program to
 
Portuguese schools in the United States which includes mone-
tary support, free textbooks, and direct guidance by a trained
 
"
coordinator" living in the United States.
 Rmilia Mendonça is
 
Inspectora do Enslno Elementaj' currently employed by the
 
"Service of Basic and
. Secondary Education for Portuguese Over-
seas."  She works out of the Portuguese consulate in
. Providence,
 
Rhode 1sland and is the first person to have held this position
 
having been in the United States for two years.
 There is no
 
cultural agreement between the United s tates and Portugal which
 
would allow her to act as an official inspector; she merely acts
 
as a coordinator for the various "official" Portuguese schools
 
throughout the United States.
 
Thus far she has visited schools
 
the
 
in Massachusetts (
for example, New Bedford, Fall River, Norwood
.,
 
and Ludlow),  1hode Island, Connecticut, and California.  She
 
visits the Taunton school about once a month meeting with teachers
 
and administrators.
 
Emilia Mendon a explained how the Portuguese government first
 
became interested in the role of Portuguese education in Por-
tuguese settlements in  urope.  Such programs exist in countries
 
such as  rance and Lermany where Portuguese schools are supported
 
by official agreements between Portugal and the resident countries.
 
1
1 endon a said that the first of these programs for P
t
hguese
 
living abroad was begun in 1975 in France and the last was
 
started in the United States about 1977.  Tt was noted that per
 
enti 6/30/82
 
-13-
haps American bilingual teachers were responsible for the
 
eventual awareness of the Portuguese government that there was
 
a need for support in the United ttates.  Mendor
a emphasized
 
that Portuguese schools in America voluntarily choose to accept
 
Portuguese government aid (
some Portuguese schools do choose to
 
remain independent and private):  "It is not the Portuguese gov-
ernment who's imposing these schools, It's the freedom of the
 
parents that are interested in the education,  to learn the Por-
tuguese culture and language,  that makes the Portuguese govern-
ment aware that they should be interested and help these schools
 
to go ahead in the right way.  It's an answer to a call, to the
 
need."  The Taunton school has availed itself df.  these services
 
since its beginning.
 Antonio Amaral noted:  "A.9thin
.g that we
 
need for our school they p ortuguese Ministry of Education
will
 
give to us within reason,"
 
Emilia Mendon9a is a trained elementary school teacher and
 
administrator.  She taught in elementary schools in her native
 
Azores for ten years and then worked as an administrator in
 
continental Portugal after taking an advanced course to become
 
an "
inspector."  Her residence in the two major areas of Pcr u-
gal as well as her teaching (including adult education) and ad-
ministrative experience qualified her for her present work.
 
Throughout the year she makes periodic reports  to the Ministry
 
of tducation in Lisbon and visits Lisbon-once a year to make
 
a direct "in-service" report.
 
Emilia  endon9a visits the Taunton school on Wednesdays at-
tending classes and meeting wi t h  teachers for two hours after
 
class to introduce supplementary material to the teachers.
 The
 
Pentj 6/30/8 2
 
texts sent to official schools from Portugal are actual texts
 
used in homeland schools  (it was said that no Portuguese school
 
teaching materials are published in the United  tates) and the
 
materials i
iendbnca presents in such meetings are intended to
 
bridge any gap between the Old Country texts and the American
 
setting.  It was said
. that Mend
.onqa had written the supplemen-
tary materials herself "to tell the teachers how to go about
 
teaching to these youngsters, because Portuguese is a second
 
S
 
language actually and they have to be more precise and direct
 
than if it was the first language."  The method used is called
 
"direct teaching" with an attempt made to relate lessons to
 
daily like and realistic situations. eC
Dr example, during .
the
 
April meeting Xendon5a presented a lesson plan consisting of
 i
s
 
a map of a Portuguese city showing places such as the post of-
fice and museum which was intended to aid students in functioning
 
on visits to the Old Country.  It was mentioned how previously
 
she had given a lesson where students were asked to describe
 
their homes in America comparing them to houses in the homeland
 
based on knowledge students obtained from their parents.  Men-
don5a commented that such lessons ser-
d to combine the teaching
 
of Portuguese language, history and culture and the school's
 
lessons were not divided according to subject.
 
In return
, for Portuguese government support the official
 
school must fulfill certain requirements.  First of all,  the
 
school s teachers must be qualified teachers educated in the
 
Portuguese system with seventy five pereent being fully certifie
s
 
It was said that it has been
, somewhat difficult to find such
 
teachers.

man and has  to drive a considerable distance to class.  It is
 
hoped that there will be less difficult to locate teachers in
 
the future and the principal of the school spoke of two teachers
 
who had expressed interest in joining the staff.  To gain the
 
approval of the Ministry of Education the school has to forward
 
teachers'  credentials and resumes to Portugal via the Portuguese
 
consul in New Bedford.
 Two of the present teachers are both
 
certified and experienced in Portuguese elementary school
 
teaching;  the third
, has attended a teacher training school and
 
also has taught in Angola but is not certified.  The school is
 
also required to submit periodic reports to the Ministry of
 
Education in Lisbon wh
ich, for example, indicate student en-
rollment.
 The local Portugueae consul also makes periodic
 
visits to the school in an official capacity.
 
Not only does the school receive the already mentioned bene-
fits operating as an of f
icial school, but the students also re-
ceive the benefit of the possibility of taking an official exami-
nation whose successful passage would allow them to enter high
 
school in
. Portugal.  4o student yet has been qualified to take
 
this examination, but it is hoped that some will do this in the
 
spring of 1983 (two students in the advanced class mentioned
 
that they would take the exam at this time).  Normally students
 
are advanced from one class to another without special examina-
tion , but rather on the basis of successful completion of a
 
Year's classw
k. The week before classes end the teachers meet
 
with Emilia k
lendonSa to evaluate students' progress (
each student
 
has a file where copies of his report cards and work are kept)
 
deciding who will be promoted to another level (
in some cases
 
anti 6/30/8 2
 
-16-
the school struc t
ure of three classes apparent.y does not
 
allow for actual promotion;
' for example students in the ad-
vanced class may remain there for more than one year since
 
there is not a higher class).  Each student receives a diploma
 
at graduation in recognition of a year's attendance.
 
Administrators, teachers, and parents consistently, praised
 
ror tuga l for the support it has given the school.
 The school
 
president, Antonio Amaral, explained how the Ministry of  duca-
tion's support had been invaluable.  Paced with the task of
 
opening a new school, the founders were happy to accept the
 
supervision and guidance provided by the homeland as well as
 
financial support in terms of a subsidy (this year's grant
 
amounted to just under 1, 500 dollars) and quantities of text
 
books.  Ohe parent noted how he was "touched" to see "
the poor
 
Portuguese government" wanting "to help us keep our culture
 
and pass our culture to the next ones;" he wondered "how can
 
they have the courage to do it?"

grateful for the help provided by the Ministry of  ducation
 
coordinator.  Fernando £
% rais,
 teacher and principal, commented
 
on his relationship with L
iendon5a:
 "We are in constant touch
 
wi t
h
, each other;  that's why I say it's very useful."  If he
 
discovers, for example, that a certain lesson does not succeed
 
in class he will call the coordinator to ask for her suggestions
 
on other methods of approach."  Another parent contrasted the
 
excellent facilties of the Taunton school with the crowded
 
classrooms of his boyhood school, on Payal where 60 to 70
 
students of all ages were taught in one room by one t
eacher and
 
wondered how the Portuguese government could manage to support
 
schools in the United States.  Antonio Amaral explained the
 
anti
 
/3o/82
 
-17-
 
interest of the P
ortuguese gover
nt:  "Portugal is a country
 
of immigrant; people from the beginning since the Discoveries.
 
And a lot of people have a tendency to look for better days
 
outside even though sometimes they could have the same opportu-
b
.ity in the country.  I guess it's in our blood.  And so they
 
immigrate to all over the world and
. the Portuguese government,
 
knowing that, they would like to continue the culture of those
 
immigrants outside the country.  So they promote the culture
 
and the
 
side of
 
ernment
 
teaching of the Portuguese language and culture out.-
the country."  He alato noted that the Portuguese gov-
would receive benefits in return for its policy:  "But
 
you have to keep in consideration that the immigrants are .
a big
 
part of income for the country
, by tourism a
rid by improving the
 
relationship between the immigrants and the generations actual-
ly they are improving the tourists in the future.
 
of the reasons I have, perhaps there are others . "  
That's
 
ie
 
This pr-
-,-
motion of official schools apparently occurs  through the media-
t
ion of the local Portuguese consul.  It was noted how the New
 
Bedford consul had helped in the formation of the xaunton school.
 
there are other schools in his jurisdiction (Ne w Bedford and
 
gall diver, for example) and it was noted how he hoped to
 
initiate a new school in Provincetown.
 The Providence, Rhode
 
island, and  oston consuls administer other Portuguese of f
tcial
 
schools in the area.
 The Taunton school appears to have flourished
 
under Portuguese A
1in.istry of Vducation guidance; as ?resident
 
Amaral commented:  "This way we have more benefits."
 
School Administration
  
After' -the initial 1980 meeting  a committee was formed to begin
 
Penti 6/30/82
 
- 
18-
work on the school such as visiting another offic5aJ. school
 
in Cumberland, Rhode Island
.; Antonio Amaral, for example, was
 
part of this group.  Each school year in the fall the parents
 
meet to elect the school's administration based on the philoso-
phy: "
the ideal is to have a school run by the parents  (Antonio
 
Amaral)."  Amaral, a parent, has served as president of the
 
school far  two years; he is assisted by Jose Gon alves, the vice-
president, who has ser
d during the same per od.  The second
 
term s
chool treasurer is Joseph Fresta., not a parent but a
 
leader in the local Portuguese community who in his retirement
 
years is able to devote considerable time to the school.  The
 
only non-local administrator is Joselina Guerreiro, the secre-
tary, a bilingual teacher.  All of these officers have been
 
involved with the school since its inception.
 The administra-
tion also includes five elected school directors many of whom
 
are parents.  The entire administration meets about omce every
 
three months although pressing needs are fulfilled without a
 
meeting;  the administration is said to be responsible for
 
"
everything." _
 Officers are often in attendance on school tights.
 
Gon
.qalves is always present to open and close the school as well
 
as to take care of school business in the library, such as cor-
respondence to the Ministry of Education in Lisbon, and perhaps
 
even to call '
-
'arents of absent students.  The administration is
 
also responsible for the collection of the ten dollar a month
 
tuition fee from each student.  The school principal, Fernando
 
Morais, is appointed by the administration
, and the consul; he
 
assumes responsibility for the educational part of the school.

Parents  
Parents of school children have been most supportive of the
 
school.  Antonio Amaral sees their interest as essential to
 
the future of the school:  "It's to make sure the school goes
 
ahead.  Nobody else, more than the parents, will be interested
 
in the kids'  education.
 Right?  We are there now; one of the
 
reasons I'm there now is cause my kids are there now....  Some-
day .. .  it will be the other parents'  turn...."  There is no
 
formal PTA-type organization at present although there are
 
plans to have one in the future to provide support to the school
 
and to act as a social organization.
 The school itself is
 
housed in an addition to the club built by the parents.
 In
 
addition to the fall organizational meeting the teachers called
 
another parents' meeting in late spring to determine if any
 
parents thought their children were ready to take the official
 
Ministry of Education examinaticn (none did).
 The teachers
 
noted that they enjoyed speaking with parents, Principal 1
Lcrais
 
(also a teacher) said:  "
'T
hat's how .
1
. get my information,  that's
 
how ±
 learn a great deal."  Parents frequently stop to talk with
 
teachers after class.
 n the matter of school discipline, for
 
example, the strict Portuguese parents have been most coopera-
tive in solving any problems.  The parents receive periodic in-
formation on their children's progress through report cards.
 
This close contact is maintained, because, as £
iorais expressed
 
it:  "
I inform the parents of everything that goes ont  Everything,
 
I don't want any surprises."  Amaral noted that since Portuguese
 
is spoken in the students' homes, parents are aware of children's
 
progress:
 "i believe it s easy to keep an idea,...  All the
 
enti 6/30/82
 
-
 -20-
parents speak Portuguese and L believe they can recognize the
 
progress of the young kids."
 
he parents interviewed expressed a constant concern over
 
their children's work at Portuguese school although several
 
also noted that they did not want this work to"interfere"
 
with
. the American school.
 arents also made certain sacrifices
 
in order to assure their students attendance at Portuguese, 
school.
 'here was certain financial sacrifice in paying the
 
school tuition particularly when multiple siblings were involved.
 
Certain parents find it difficult to bring and pick up children
 
from s
chool.
 The five to seven evening time slot on Wednesdays
 
and Mondays is inconvenient to some parents' work schedules
 
and they must arrange for others to take their children (one
 
parent has even hired a taxi to transport his children).  One
 
man has modified his work schedule on these days in order to
 
be available.
 
It is obvious that a certain amount of dedication is re-
quired on the part of each parent sending his child to school.
 
It was said that the community could support a larger Portuguese
 
school.  there were a variety of reasons given as to why some
 
parents do not choose to send their chiJdren to school.  Some
 
of the more obvious reasons given were that some parents might
 
lack tuition money or the time to transport their children to
 
and from school (the adn'lnistration
 has considered running a
 
bus service to rectify this, bul bas not yet proved feasible).
 
One comment was that recent immigrants were concerned only with
 
the adjustment to American life and the learning of English. A
 
general apathy towards education on the part of some parents
 
Pentj 6/30/62
 
-21-
also was cited.  Another frequent comment was that student
 
attendance reflected regional differences.  Immig ants from
 
mainland Portugal were said to be more interested in culture
 
and education; tha majority of students' parents were said to
 
have been born on the continent whereas the ma o±ity of Por-
tuguese in the community were said to have been born in the
 
Azores.
 
All the parents interviewed were born in Portugal or a Por-
tuguese territory (one was born and raised in Angola).  Ex-
plaining their motivations in sending their children to Portu-
guese school, most parents noted that they wanted them to learn
 
the Portuguese language and also to study Portuguese culture
 
and history.
 One father saw it as his "
obligation" to send his
 
children ("As a father I should send my children to school").
 
Another father remembered his first years in America during the
 
late 1950s when he could not find someone easily who could
 
speak both Portuguese and  nglish.  He hoped his children as
 
bilingual speakers might be able to help new immigrants and
 
he a]
,-
-o saw his children's bilingualism as assisting them in
 
finding be tsr jobs in the future s Ancther common reason given
 
was to allow children to be able to communicate with non- &ig1is4
 
speaking relatives both in the United states and in the homeland;
 
cited
 
occasions for speaking Portuguese in A
xneri
caAwere  at the dinner
 
table in the presence of grandparents (
it is common for three
 
generations of a Portuguese family to live in the same household)
 
or at celebratory Portuguese events such as weddings and festas.
 
It was common for students to have visited Portugal or to be
 
intending to visit the homeland in the future.  One father, for
 
example, spoke of his desire to bring his two children with
 
Penti  /30/82
 
-22-
dim :
o visit the h
.cuae he was born in on Fayal on the occasion
 
of his and his wife's twenty-fifth wedding anniversary; he
 
saw the children's school attendance as aiding them in having
 
a memorable  trip.  The writing of letters by student3 to their
 
relatives in Portugal was cited as pro
o f of their accomplish-
2
lents.
 
Transportation, tuition expenses, and home supervisien were
 
given as parents' obligations in sending their children to Por-
tuguese school.  Any parent was said to have  to fulfil], these
 
three elements of commitment.  These obligations can occupy
 
significant  time.  Tra n
sportation to school can take twenty
 
minutes in each direction through city traffic.  Many parents
 
wait in cars in the parking lot while their children are in
 
class.  Others use the time to go shopping.
 Some men visit the
 
downstairs bar in winter (women may sit in the hail of the club)
 
or watch soccer 9ames in warm weather.  Parents were seen to
 
be the guiding force in sending children to school (many students
 
noted that they attended school at their parents' insistence)
 
as well as in supporting the school through their persona]. ef-
forts.
 
Classes and Curriculum
  
The .
bscol a Oficializada do taunton Soorts Club began classes
 
on i
iovember 5
, 1980.  The first year's enrollment numbered  42
 
students divided into two classes  (by age)  taught by Claudina
 
Nunes and Ciaudina  orges.
 The school operates two nights a
 
week (Mondays and Wednesdays) from five to seven in the evening.
 
During the first year one 
-class met in the main club hail and
 
the other met in a small adjacent room.  This unsuitable situa-
S
 
Penti 6/30/82
 
-  23-
ticn served as the impetus for the construction of a classroom
 
addition to the club.
 The construction of this addition (no
 
other area Portuguese school has yet entered into such con-
struction)  occurred during the 1981 summer.  Antonio Amaral
 
explained:  t
tEvery
 .
afternoon we used to go there after work
 
and every Saturday."  School vice-president, Josh Gon alves,
 
even spent his summer vacation on the construction.  Some of
 
those involved in the work were said to have put up some of
 
their own money to allow the purchase of initial supplies.
 
Parents built the school with the only hired help being that
 
of an electrician.  As a resu1l  construction costs were kept
 
to 17,000 dollars.  Funds were raised and will continue to be
 
raised through raffles, dances, and dinners.  The school does
 
remain in siae debt.  Antonio Amaral estimates that it will
 
take two years to repay this and then only general operating
 
expenses will remain such as electricity and heating costs
 
(no rent is paid).  The children's ten dollar a month tuition
 
fees are anticipated to be able to provide for these expenses
 
as well as each teacher s one hundred dollar a month salary.
 
The school texts as well as supporting materials such as the
 
maps of Portugal for each classroom and the academic guidance
 
of Emilia  endonja are provided free of charge by the Portu-
guese government.  Students are only required to supply their
 
own notebooks; the school even provides their pencils.
 The
 
school facilities are excellent.  There are three bright class-
rooms furnished with suitable desks, cnairs, and blackboards
 
which were donated by a local school.  A fourth room is used
 
as a meeting room and for the storage of tex ts an d sc hoo l files.
 
Penti 6/30/8 2
 
An outside stairwell serves as the main entrance to the school
 
although the addition is connected internally to the main club
 
building.
 The school addition was inaugerated officially on
 
June 25, 1982 on the occasion of the visit of the Portuguese
 
Secretary of E
migration, Dr. José' At
h'iano Gage Vitorino.
 
During the 1981-82 school year there have been 62 students
 
enrolled in the school.
 The students come primarily from Taun-
ton although. a few are said to come from neighboring Raynhain.
 
A couple students have begun classes during the middle of the
 
year and a couple conversely have dropped out of the school;
 
but the basic enrollment has remained consistent.  There are
 
three classes -
 beginning, intermediate, and advanced, taught
 
respectiv 1y by Claudina Aunes, Jos
 1
a1hinha,  and
. Fernando
 
1
rais.  The students are divided mainly by age  (for "psycho-
logical" reasons) rather than simply by language ability,  The
 
students in the beginning class range from 7 to 11 years, in
 
the intermediate class from
. 8 to 12 years, and in the advanced
 
class from 13 to 17 years.
 
During the course of the fieldwork a session of each class
 
was attended.  The classes emphasized Portuguese language
 
training.
 -n each class the chosen texts were analysed word
 
by word.
 There were written excercises (
some texts have
 
workbooks) including spelling and dictation; conversation was
 
encouraged.
 The exact lesson content and teaching methods were
 
determined by the level of the students and the judgment of
 
the teacher.
 The beginning class observed was devoted to langu-
age study -
 reading aloud, writing texts,  spelling words,  and
 
conversation.
 Nunes noted that her greatest problem was to
 
.enti 6/30/82
 
-2 -
teach her students to speak Portuguese well.  4s a result,
 
she tried to draw students into conversation whenever possible
 
either during the study of the text or through
. a discussion
 
about the children's families in Portugal.
 The intermediate
 
class observed was based directly on the day's text with
 
students reading the text, taking dictation, and working on
 
spelling.
 Comprehension and grammar were emphasized with
 
students conjugating various verbs as well as varying ncun
 
in the basic text.  In the advanced class observed the lesson
 
was directly based on the day's text aiming at comprehension
 
of the subject matter, grammatical understanding (
verb conju-
gation and compound sentence construction),  and proper spelling.
 
orais tried to draw his students into Portuguese conversation
 
throughout the class, because he feels student skills in this
 
area are most lacking.
 
This observation as well as the interviews with teachers
 
showed the major emphasis of the school to be clearly on
 
Portuguese language training.  As a result of most students'
 
lack -of fluent Portuguese skills,  the class level in Portuguese
 
school was on a lower level tuan in American schools.  Otier
 
subjects,  such as history, were taught in the school; but this
 
was done typically in an indirect manner as part of the general
 
langauge instruction.  In the observed beginning class, for exam-
ple,  there was a discussion of a project '
t
hich would involve
 
the students writing letters to their families in  '
ortugal.
 
Through this discussion students drew comparisons between ele-
ments of life in Portugal and in the U ni ted States.  The teacher,
 
Claudlna Nunes, explained the p 3pcse of such projects:
 "All
 
Penti 6/30/82
 
-26-
we do b
.ere Ls  to
 mpare America to Portugal....  Somethi ng we
 
got in America, we got in PrtugaI.
 Lou  know they are just
 
kids, but - -
 choose the easier way to take them to Portugal in
 
thinking."  On this night these comparisons were made by stu-
dents who actuall:j had visited Portugal.  Again in the inter-
mediate class actual language learning was emphasized and
 
other subjects entered the lesson obliquely,
 in the course
 
of the lesson, for example, Malhinha explained some basic
 
science concerning the son as part of text comprehension.
 He
 
also made a comparison to the homeland using part of the text
 
noting that one could not see the sea in Taunton, but that in
 
the Azores  "all the time we see the sea around us."  ae noted
 
how the teac h
ing of subjects such as mathematics were 1ert  -
-c.
-
American schools and the teaching of Portuguese h13tcrr dLrect17
 
was left for the advanced class.  In his classroom history was
 
mentioned only as part of a particular text; he told how the
 
tea
ng of Portuguese history was difficult:  "We have a big
 
problem with Portuguese history, cause it's more than eight
 
hund ed years."
 
Fernando  orais, advanced class teacher as well as school
 
principal,  elaborated on the subjects taught in the Portuguese
 
school.
 e emphasized that the basic subject was language it-
self saying that each class must include reading, spelling,
 
and conversatIon.  He told how each class  also included the
 
teaching of  "
social studies" which he defined:  "The way the
 
people live in Portugal,  .. .
 where the population is [locatedJ
 
. . . ,
 the Portuguese climate,  the main products grown, the main
 
source of Portuguese income, and, of course, we havb to teach
 
anti 6/30/8 2
 
-27-
the children if they visit Portugal what they have to do...,
 
all the expressions he needs to know in order to be comfortable
 
on a visit or go there to live."  It is only in the advanced
 
class that students directly study Portuguese history.  Noras
 
estimated that his students spend an hour on social studios an-
,
4
 
history on Mondays and a half hour on Wednesdays.
 o told
 
how his students began their study of history with a description
 
of how the Portuguese nation was 1
'
 orined, where the people lived,
 
and how Portugal became an independent country which grew and
 
entered into the times df the Discoveries.  Re noted how this
 
year the students had advanced as far as the end of the conquest
 
of Portuguese territory from the Arabs, namely the twelfth to
 
fourteenth centuries.  During next year he plans t
o continue
 
with the chronological sequence.  Advanced students interviewed
 
mentioned the study of Portuguese history as part of their cur-
riculum, but they preferred language studies.
 
The texts, as noted, other than a few directly pur.haaed in
 
a New  bedford Portuguese bookstore when the school began, come
 
free of charge from the Portuguese Ministry of  ducation in Lis-
bon.  All are actual texts used in schools in Portugal.  Texts
 
are marked with the suitable level in the Portuguese System.
 
Many texts bear not only a Taunton Sports stamp (
such a  "ESCOLA
 
OFICIAL DO ENSINO PRIMA Io DO TAUNTON SPORTS CLUB, INC./ BAKER
 
ROAD/ TAUNTON, MASSACHUSETTS O278O') but also with the Portuguese
 
Ministry of
 ducation stamp (
such as "OFERTA/ INSTITUTO DE CUL
 
TURA E LINGUA
. POi rUGUESA SER

PORTtJGUES NO ESTRANGEIROTt).
 The paperback texts are colorful
 
and are recent publicatio n
s  (late 1970s and afterwards).

recently,  just before fieldwork began,  there had existed the
 
problematic situation of there not being sufficient texts for
 
each class.
 Trying to treat each school equally, the Portuguese
 
consulate typically would forward only three, four, or five
 
copies of a text forcing the teacher to use several texts in
 
one class or to make xeroxed copies for each student.  The
 
teachers were enthusiastic that finally enough copies of texts
 
for each class had arrived from Portugal.  The
 inistry of Edu-
cation also has provided a map of Portugal for each classroom
 
as well as some suprorting books  such as d!ct± nar eg
 
works
 
It was emphasized how each teacher is free to choose not
 
only the text he wishes  (currently there areAozens of texts
 
0
 
stacked on tables in the meeting room), but also the specific
 
lesson he wishes.  Sometimes a teacher continue in sequence
 
through a particular book;  at other times he may move from text
 
to text.  There is no prescribed sequence of teaching as there
 
might be in Portugal; there is a freedom of selection possibly
 
based in the American setting.  Fernando Morals noted how he
 
chose "
suitable" lessons which would be understandable to his
 
students.
 .
i
.n cases where certain lesson aspects were foreign
 
to his students, k
'
Iorais told how he acted as a bridge between
 
the Pa'tuguese seating of the book and the American setting of
 
the students.
 Not only did he do this in regard to the l ngu-
age where texts were aimed for Portuguese students with native
 
fluency and the American students found certain words to be
 
alien, but he also did this in regard to subject matter.  "1ora1s
 
gave the example of encountering texts which mentioned birds
 
S

.
 
enti 6/30/82
 
-29-
native to Pcrtugal but alien to the United ttates forcing him
 
to explain them before the text could be studied. Just as the
 
teacher acts as a bridge between text and student,  the Portuguese
 
Ministry of Education coordinator also is faced with the job of
 
adapting curriculum to the American setting.  At the monthly
 
meeting with teachers she presents materials she is said to have
 
written for specific use in the Portuguese schools in the UrJ.ted
 
'tates.  During the observed April meeting she explained several
 
groups of duplicated pages to the teachers which included, for
 
example, the already mentioned map lesson which served to fa-
miliarize the student with a typical Pr tuguese environment
 
allowing him, for example,  to purchase a stamp or a bu 41cket.
 
-
.t was obvious that the teachers were involved in the pro-
cess of selectling appropriate books, because the school was
 
only in the second year of operation (and two taachers were in
 
their first year) and the texts had become available only re-
cently in sufficient quantity.
 The intermediate teacher, Jose
 
alhInha, was faced with the unique situation of beginning
 
teaciing at the end of the year replaôing Claudina Borges who
 
was forced to quit as a result of a change in her work schedule.
 
Fernando 1 orais illustrated the process of a teacher familiarizing
 
himself with a text.  He showed one book, Inlagens de Portugal;,
 
which had impressed him as being particularly valuable  ("In
 
other words by reading this book, the person is going back
 
home, like on a trip"). There are only a couple copies o
f  this
 
book available in the  Launton school and,  as a consequence, he
 
has been able to use it only in a limited way.  For next year
 
he is ordering copies for each of his students as well as for
 
r
tj 6/30/82
 
-30-
interested parents.
 The book provides a description of each
 
part of Portugal even to the point of presenting traditional
 
recipes and songs.  Several of the books sent by the Portuguese
 
Ministry of  '
ducation are not actual texts, but are books on
 
a variety of subjects such as one which contains selected texts
 
I
 
of the famous poet, Luis De damoes. It is hoped that in the
 
future the books sent from Portugal will serve as the basis of
 
a Portuguese library not only for students, but also for their
 
3arents snri interested community members.
 
The three teachers stressed the difficulty of teaching only
 
our hours a week and of teaching at a time of the day when
 
the children are tired.  Aae students come to  ortuguese school
 
having already spent a full day in American schools and attend
 
Portuguese school at a customary dinner hour.
 Nunes and Mor a
ls
 
told how they worked to gain students' attention through the
 
device of  "games."  Claudina Nunes, for example, divided her
 
class into two teams which competed in a dictation excercise at
 
the blackboard with a member from each t
eam simultaneously
 
working for points.
 The children obviously loved this excercise
 
and cheered when she announced it.  As encouragement, Nunes also
 
placed examples of the best student work on the classroom walls.
 
She explained her methods:  "They get so excited and this way I
 
think I can take their attention to what t am doing...."  Morals
 
ran a week-to week spelling contest for his advanced students
 
with each student competing for individual points; the winners (four)
 
received a copy of one of the general books sent from Portugal.
 
Judging from the intense discussion by students concerning the
 
contest rules, it was clear that Morals did gain their attention.

Penti 6
,'30/8 2

During the observed class Morals utilized the contest to have
 
the students familiarize themselves with dictionaries newly
 
arrived from
. Lisbon.  Students '
commented how they enjoyed th is
 
sort of work and one told
, how Morals
 had translated A
iierican
 
games such
. as  'Hangman" into Portuguese for class use.
 
A constant t
hzme expressed by both parents and teachers was
 
the intention that Portuguese school work would not interfere
 
with students' American school work.  Morals explained:
 "One
 
thing we don't want is to interfere with the other school.  We
 
don't want to overload the students too much.  We don 't want
 
the student to go t
o his own t
eacher . . .
 and say '
I've got too
 
much work from the Portuguese school.'"  The Portuguese school
 
teachers had never given any homework to student until recently.
 
During the spring parents' meeting, several parents told how
 
their children easily could manage some homework and actually
 
requested some work which they could help their cb
.i3. ren with
 
over the weekend.  As a result the t
eachers have been experi-
menting with limited amounts of homework.  Morals, for example,
 
had asked for four sentence essays and was pleased wi
 
results:  "Usually £ ask
. them to do things which get t
 
gether with their pare -i
ts on finding out things about the Old
 
Country -
 old stories,  traditions,
 That way father and son,
 
father and daughter get together and talk about old,  the things
 
in their motherland.
 The kids can learn an awful lot by doing
 
that."
 
Certain special
 
projects are done throughout the course of
 
the school year (
the school follows the American school calen-
dar).  Examples of such projects were seen during the course
 
Pent  6/30/82
 
-32-
of the fieldwork.  One project done by the advanced class con-
sisted of drawings depicting Portuguese emigration around the
 
world which would be sent to the Ministry of -ducation in Lisbon
 
to compete in a contest for Portuguese school students outside
 
the homeland.
 Two of these drawings, foe example, indicated
 
the countries around the world where significant Portuguese
 
settlements were located and a third depicted Corte- eal,  the
 
early Portuguese explorer, at Dighton Rock which is located
 
near th. school.  Other projects of limited length included
 
the beginning class project of preparing its own newsp
er,
 
0 Nosso Jornal. 
Students wrote the copy and used some pictures
 
taken from Portuguese newspapers.  As mentioned, the class also
 
wrote letters to family members in Portugal.
 
The major, closing project of the school year was done in
 
honor of the "Day of Portugal (June lO)'  This year's theme,
 
as announced in Lisbon, was  "The Day of Portugal and Portuguese
 
Communities."  Fernando  orais, as school principal, selected
 
the school theme.  He translated the essay theme:  "Please ex-
plain in your own words in what way have the Portuguese contri-
buted to the development in our community."
 tudents also made
 
complimentary drawing on this theme,
 The essays and drawings
 
were displayed on the walls of the school hallway for viewing
 
by parents and friends during the Day of Portugal soccer games
 
held at the club on June 9 and also after
- graduation on June 25.
 
The Portuguese consul was so impressed by the work that at
 
graduation ceremonies he awarded special certificates for
 
first and second prizes in the drawing and essay category from
 
each class.

One student in the advanced class, Steve Almeida, described
 
the Portuguese community in a prize-winning essay /'ranslation
 
by Fernando  oraisJ:
 "The dream of the Portuguese when he goes
 
to a different country is to improve  nd better his way of life.
 
When he arrives, he works hard, saves his money, and makes lots
 
of sacrifices in order to make his dreams come true,
 the Por-
tuguese immigrant is a hard worker.  He likes  to pay his debts,
 
because he is honest and proud.  He wants to have nice and beau-
tiful things and he keeps his name clean.  Lots of Portuguese
 
buy old houses,  they make i
rri 4rovements, and they become just
 
like new.
 Other Portuguese have their own businesses, for in-

 Later
 
they become lawyers, doctors, teachers, and

the most important figures is Cardinal  umberto Nedeiros
 
Others work in markets, factories,  and

 The streets
 
where the Portuguese live keep looking much better:.  The houses
 
have been improved.  there are beautiful gardens, beautiful
 
statues of saints near the beautiful houses. 'he Portuguese

Lourdes, at the PACC, Taunton Sports and our school and the Day
 
of Portugal." This essay is given in its entirety to indicate
 
student conceptions about the ethnic community and ethnic
 
values.
 
Two calendi'ical holidays are marked with special programs
 
by the school children.  At Christmas there is a school party
 
sponsored by the 'aunton Sports Club where students perform
 
Portuguese and American (translated into Portuguese) Christia
 
songs.  Each class also is respzinsible for a program segment;
 
last jear the beginiing class portrayed the Kings of Orient.
 
This function occurs in the club hall.  The '

community itself.  The direct student share is represented by
 
the drawing and essays just described which are done in class.

Portugal soccer games which were held on a normal school night

Student Language Ca abilities  
Students come to the Portuguese school with a previous
 
knowledge of Portuguese.
 The majority of students have parents
 
born in Portugal.  Some of the students t
zere born
, in Bortugal
 
themselves;  the majority of those in the advanced class were
 
said to have been born in Portugal zc
ining to the united States
 
at an early age while the majority of those in the beginning
 
class were said to have been born in the United States.  Re-
gardless of their birthplace, the majority of students have spent
 
several years in America.  Only one present school student was
 
said to have come recently from Portugal.  The  typical home
 
situation finds students hearing their parents and grandpa1ents
 
speak Portuguese while they reply in En
glish.
 The main problem
 
said
, to be addressed by teachers is to teach the students to
 
speak Portuguese fluently.  Antonio Amaral explained such a
 
t
uaticn In  is family (he and his wife are ir
nmi rants,  their
 
ildren are born in the united States):
 "We always speak
 
Porti guese;  the kids answer in English.  We are so involved that
 
we sometimes don't recognize that they're speaking English back
 
to us.  The two languages work simultaneously.
 e don't try
 
to correct them; that's why they understand, but they're kind
 
of lazy speaking it cause they're afraid it's not  coning out,
 
r. and I
Irs.
 ernando 'orais indicated asixn.ilar situation in
 
their home.
 They are both fluent in English and primarily
 
speak English in their work.  Although they customarily speak
 
Portuguese between themselves, they noted that as a result of
 
their work day they may continue to speak English at home with-
I
'

out re
izing it.  Similarly Fernando v
iorais noted how his
 
children speak Englis h all day at school and continue to speak
 
it when they cone home as they socialize with friends or sneak
 
to their parents.
 e described the primacy of  nglish:  "That
 
language keeps going on and on.?  The influence of the American
 
setting results in students of the Portuguese school having
 
English as  their main language.
 
e teachers emphasized that they are faced with the teaching
 
of Portuguese as a second language.
 Claudina Nunes descrih
 
the situation as a parent and teacher; "They,
/-the st
hdents
 
also try to speak just English.  They don't want to speak Por-
tuguese.
 We have to say  'You have to speak Portuguese' and
 
then they do.
 Like my kids they speak well Portuguese, but
 
not so well  . . .
 like
 i
hex / they were in Portugal."  She is
 
familiar witn the typical home situation:  "They have spent all
 
day speaking  nglish and they go home,., and speak English to
 
their parents and they r parent i
l don't care and they just
 
answer back in Prtuguese and they don't for c  . . .
 the kids to
 
speak in Portuguese cause they understand English.  So they
 
Z5arent 7 just speak Portu guese
 bac k and  they
 thdents 7 answer
 
in English.
 
The primary aim of the Portuguese school appears
 
to be to
 
provide the students with an increased fluency in Portuguese,
 
Principal Morals explained;  "
In this school that's what we're
 
doing; we're pursuing the improvement in the Portuguese langu-
age.  Ve want them Lstudentsj to learn and improve; but, of
 
course, we know the Portuguese language is going to be their
 
second language.
 W want to maintain our culture and our cus-

tons and everything, but we have to realize that English is the
 
first language and Portuguese will be their second language.
 
3ut, of course, when they meet Portuguese peop14 they socialize
 
in Portuguese functions,  and they are going to use •. .
 the Por-
tuguese language.  It won't be lost there;  they know how to com-
municate and they know how to deal with those things."
 
i
e students' prime fluency in English intrudes upon the
 
classroom situation and general school environment.  One night,
 
while setting up a tape recorder before class,  the fieldworker
 
overheard some girls having an English conversation in the
 
classroom.
 One boy entered the room, took one look at the
 
fieldworker and told the girls:  "This is a Portuguese school,
 
not English "  One girl replied that class had not begun and
 
continued to speak English.  Students always spoke English with
 
one another before and afte r class. During class students con-
t
inu .to address each other in English.  Claudina iunes, as the
 
;
eachers, found it impossible to lim it classes to Per t
h-
anguage usage:  "But we can never get this from the kids,
 
bec ause they already have the Idea to speak in
. English even if
 
they are jo ki ng or anything.
 They just try to speak znglish,
 
they just speak .nglish.  All the time I say '
io English,  just
 
Portuguese
 But forget iti'" Fernando Morals would preterd not
 
to understand students' English statements forcing th ni to use
 
Portuguese
..  Yet he admitted that it was impossible to keep
 
English out of the classroom and told how he,  too, had to use
 
English:  "Sometimes I have to use English for meanings, because
 
right now English is their first language and they have a larger
 
vocabulary in English than Portuguese."

This English fluency creates certain difficulties in le
 
Portuguese.
 Advanced class students, for example, already have
 
a good knowledge of English grammar which, at times, may confuse
 
them.  Morais laughed as he told how he would explain certain
 
grammatical aspects and students, based on their understanding
 
of English grammar, would tell him:  "No, you are wrongs" One
 
obvious influence of English is seen in students'  American
 
accents while speaking Portuguese.  English fluency interferes
 
with students' writing of Portuguese.  Claudina Nunes explained:
 
they write some sentence they just .. . ,
 some words they
 
write like English.  I got a lot of i
lroblems with this, but it's
 
normal."  Students also were observed having some difficulty in
 
remembering the use of various diacritical z
iar'ks which occur in
 
Portuguese, but not in
. English.  Teachers,  therefore, are re-
quired to mediate between the two languages particularly in
 
the advanced class where students have a firmer grounding in
 
the study of English.
 
All three teachers have witnessed a progressive improvement
 
in their students' understanding of Portuguese.  Claudina Nunes
 
poke of her beginning students:  "They / he parentsJ are very
 
happy like the father of Jennifer, for example.
 She couldn't
 
speak, almost nothing .. . .
 She i
s doing very well with seven
 
years old.
 They can speak,  they can understand everything.
 
When she came, she understood some things in Portuguese,
 
not everything; but she could speak almost nothing.  And like
 
here 1 had other kids with the same problem and all parents  to
 
me they say '
It's excellent!'
 They can speak with them,  they
 
can see . . . .
 They can learn now very well Portuguese.
 They try

to communicate with the family in Portuguese...
,. They're
 
gladl"  In his short time at the school the intermwdiate
 
teacher i
w
ialhinha saw progress in the reading and writing abili-
ties of his students.  Advanced class teacher Morais saw the
 
improvement of his students in the fact that he no longer had
 
to remind them continually not to speak English, but to speak
 
Portuguese:  "At first they were shy LTo speak Portugues e
 now
 
every day they are more and more comfortable."  Students were
 
aware of their own improvement.  Steve Almeida, an ei
h grader
 
in the advanced class, felt he had improved in his Portuguese
 
reading and writing skills but saw his greatest progress in
 
his speaking skill s.  This student was selected to read his own
 
essay at graduation excercises explaining his affection towards
 
the Portuguese language.
 Teresa Amaral, another advanced class
 
student,
 was enthusiastic about her improved Portuguese skills
 
especially in hei  ability  to write letters to a girl she had
 
met on a recent trip to Portugal.
 When she began her correspon-
dence her mother had had to help her with almost every word,
 
now  eresa can write letters by herself.  She also looked fo
 
'
i
ard to future trips to Portugal where, unlike the previous
 
visit (before she began Portuguese school) when she could not
 
communicate,  she can practice her developed speaking skills.
 
Students
  
The students have mixed attitudes towards attending Portuguese
 
school.  This is only natural considering their age and the fact
 
that they come  to school tired from a day in
 
Students frequently explained that they came

to Portuguese
 
come,  Yet there
 
enti 6/30/82
 
were others who were "
excited" about Portuguese school and said
 
without parental urging
 
they would attenc3.  Most teachers and administrators, though,
 
would agree with Fernando Morals's assessment:  "I believe a
 
good part of them are there because their parents want them to
 
be."  A consistent complaint of older students was that atten-
dance at Portuguese school kept them from doing their regular
 
homework.
 
Since the Portuguese live throughout the city over a wide
 
area, students may come to school without knowing any other
 
students.
 As a result these children are able to meet new
 
friends and develop their friendship network through Portuguese
 
affiliation.
 Teresa Amaral explained:  '. . .
 I guess in this
 
school everybody has something in common w
ith you cause you're
 
Portuguese and the same thing at home.
 i 3
 
/
.b
.igh schc 47 your culture is different from ev '-rc e
 
and you might not have as many things in common."  Students
 
are enthusiatic about the new friends they have made through
 
Portuguese school and talked of telephoning these friends or
 
even -visiting them in their homes.  Other students explained
 
how they had the same friends in both Portuguese school and
 
American school.
 
Speaking of what they have learned at Portuguese school,
 
students emphasized language skills, talking of improvements
 
in writing (especially spelling) and speaking.
 Advanced students
 
also noted their study of Portuguese hi
cr:-. Regardless of
 
these improvements students explained that they did not speak
 
Portuguese among their peers reserving it for conversations
 
with parents in the few homes where the family spoke Portuguese
 
Penti 6/3 0/8 2
 
and with those who do no; speak English such as grandparents
 
or other relatives.  Writing letters to Portugal was cited
 
frequently as a use of- new student skills.
 Parenta also told
 
of seeing children reading Portuguese newspapers in the home
 
or of noticing their improved comprehension at functions such
 
as plays given in Portuguese.
 
The Portuguese school offers some "
extracurricular  activi-
ties for students.
 here appear.  to be no other ethnic oriented
 
activities for children in the city (PACC was said to sponsor
 
baseball teams).  One activity is the Portuguese school "folk-
lore group!?
 which was started last year.  Practices occur on
 
spring nights after Wednesday classes and last for about a half
 
hour.  The group consists of about a dozen students who dress
 
for performances in costumes made by the school secretary's
 
mother.  The girls wear their own white blouses with black
 
gathered skirts trimmed with red, green, and yellow ribbons
 
and with
 red head kerchiefs.
 The boys wear white shirts
 
and black pants of their own with black vests, red waist
 
sashes, and red neck scarves.
 The group's only performance
 
is at school graduation although they attend other events,
 
such a
s Day of Portugal programs,  to lend"color" with their
 
costumes.  Most members come from the beginning and intermediate
 
classes.
 The group is directed by  -
saura Amaral, sister of
 
the  school president, who also directs the club's adult folk
 
-
 familiar
 
group.  The students appear to come to the group already with
 
Portuguese folk dancing and require relatively little prepara-
tion for performance.
 
This spring a soccer team was started for the boys of the
 
Pentj 6/30/82
 
school.
 the team is coa
d by Jos (Gon9alves,  school vice-
president; and it practices on Friday nights so as not to
 
interfere with school nights.  A large number of boys are team
 
members.
 The school hopes that it will be able to offer addi-
t
ional outside activities for its students in the future.
 
Teachers  
Without exception teachers indicated that they taught in
 
the Portuguese school out of a love for teaching and a love
 
for their culture.  Fernando  orais, for example, expressed
 
the wish that he could teach full-time rather than  work as
 
a manager of a Christyls Market.  He has found time in a hectic
 
work schedule to devote to the teaching of his beloved language
 
and culture;  and he plans to be associated with the school
 
indefiniLtely:  "
I'll be planning to teach for as long as
 can.
 
I love this.
'"  Claudina Nunes, who prov
id es  a warm,

guidance for her young students, comes to the school tired
 
from a day's work as a machine operator and after class resumes
 
her home duties by cooking supper.  She explained how her vitali-
ty in class faded as she left school:  "
Over here I
'm just ex-
cited.
 I don't feel nothing.  But when I get out of here,
 
oh my God "  Jose' 1"
alhinha told how he was happy to accept the
 
position recently offered him by Principal Mcrais, his former
 
classmate from St. Michael:  "
I never talk about the money,
 
because I know they don't pay too much •. . .  I like to teach
 
again my own language."  Their one hundred dollars a month
 
salary certainly does not compensate the teachers for their
 
efforts in teaching classes, attending teachers' meetings
 
and school functions, and preparing and grading lessons at
 
S

home.  All held full-time jobs outside of Taunton (Nunes and
 
r
ialhinha in factories and £
'
iorajs
 at a convenience store) and
 
had to rush to arrive at school on time.  The days at school
 
are particularly tiring for Maihinha who lives in Swansea
 
outside "'all River.
 
The teachers, as required by the Portuguese Ministry of
 
Education in confirming an official status to the school,
 
possess a background of teacher's training and teaching ex-
perience in the Portuguese elementary school system. Malb
.inha
 
and k
iorais were classmates graduating from the same teacher's
 
training school for primary education on St. Michael.  Apparent-
ly this teacher's training consists of two years of study after
 
liceu (high school) work which was followed by practical teach-
ing experience.  Morals and Malhinha graduated from this school
 
at age 19.
 Claudina Nunes was born and raised in Angola where
 
she began her studies to become an elementary school teacher
 
but did not finish them; nevertheless, she has had teaching
 
experience having taught in a .
private school in the Angolan
 
capital.
 Seventy five percent of off
 i ial school teachers
 
are required by the Ministry of  ducation to be fully certified.
 
All the teachers have emigrated to the United States in their
 
adult years accompanied by their immediate families (Maihinha's
 
parents also emigrated as did  orais's in-laws J
Ind
 
mother-in-law).  Claudina Nunes came in 1977
 via Portugal and
 
Brazil as a result of the 1975 revolution in Angola,
 Jose'
 
Naihinha came from the Azores following the 1976 revolution in
 
Portugal, and Fernando Morals came from the '
Azores in 1969.
 
Nunes and k1alhinha as recent arrivals are faced with adjustments
 
'
enti 6/30/82
 
to American life such as the learning of English; both, for
 
example, apologized for what they saw as a poor command of
 
English.  Morals is fluent in English (
speaking with only a
 
slight accent) based on his extensive English study in the
 
homeland and on the length of his American stay.  While all
 
teachers have experience in the Portuguese system (Maihinha
 
spent 15 years of first being a teacher and later being a
 
school district administrator while Morals taught for nine
 
years including a Portuguese army stint in Angola where he
 
taught fellow soldiers), none were familiar with the textbooks
 
i
ow used in the Portuguese school in Taunton.  Maihinha ex-
plained how there was only one offical book for each class
 
before the revolution, but that after the revolution in
. 1976
 
a wealth of books has
 been written.
 These new texts are the
 
ones supplied to the Taunton school.  New to teaching in the
 
American setting with unfamiliar texts (Nunas is In her second
 
year while Morals and Malhinha are in their first), the teachers
 
noted that they were involved in a learning process.
 
Despite the witnessed adaptation the curriculm of the official
 
Portuguese school in Taunton is rooted firmly in the Portuguese
 
system.

 e is in the process of making an adjust-
ment to teaching American students having taken over at the
 
end of the year from a teacher who had to quit due to work
 
schedule conflicts.  Throughout the observed class he made
 
some interesting comments contrasting the exact procedures in
 
ortuguese school to those in American schools.  These inclu-
ded the observation that Portuguese students write in script
 
on standard sized paper while American students print on all
 
types of paper and the surprise that his present students
 
chew gum in class while in homeland schools there is strict
 
discipline.
 e commented:  "I don't know if this is right, but
 
this is my ideas that come with me from
. Portugal" and "This
 
way we try to keep order in the way we work /ref
 erring to the
 
use of standard sized paper in c1ass7."  His observations in-
dicate some differences in the American and Portuguese settings.
 
4
alhinha also contrasted the structure of Portuguese and
 
American elementary schools.  He told how the Portuguese
 
elementary school training formerly lasted for four years
 
when he was a boy and now consiscs of eight years just as in
 
America.  moth parents and teachers who had experienced this
 
four year system felt that they had learned more that children
 
do today in eight years.
 
All the teachers come from a strict, traditional Portuguese
 
system background which they attempt to carry to the Taunton
 
school classrooms.  There is considerable discipline in the
 
school reinforced by parental cooperation (
one mother was over-
heard telling a teacher to pull her son's ears if he did not
 
behave).  One boy commented that the main difference between
 
Penti 6/30/82
 
the Portuguese school teachers are more "
strict."
 
The teachers meet monthly after a Wednesday class.

teachers in the United States.

teachers are somewhat demanding t

ironic fact also was nc ed that many qualified bilingual teachers
 
exist in the local Portuguese community (these had helped to
 
organize the school in fact), yet their American training pre-
vents them from teaching- in an offica]. school.
 Principal
 
Norais feels that finding additional teachers will not b6 a
 
problem in the future.
 When one second-year teacher was
 
forced to quit suddenly at the end of the year, he located
 
his former classmate Nalhinha whom he knew to be qualified.
 
Currently two other qualified teachers have expressed interest
 
in joining the staff.
 One woman is a frie t
hof k
ialhinhals
 
and another woman is due to arrive in Taunton from Portugal
 
in the near future (a relative had called Norais at b
.ore  to
 
ask if there might be any openings).
 The educated status of
 
new Portuguese immi grants appears to be able to provide suf-
ficient teachers for the official schools.
 
Purposes of the School  
A v rie y of purloses for the Portizuese school weie enumera-
ted which
 ranged from  practIcal reasons to culturally oriented
 
values.  The school obviously means different things to different
 
people according to their status (for example, student, admini-
strator, or parent); but certain consistent themes emerge.
 The
 
overt reason given for the existence of the school is language
 
instruction.  Teachers recognize the primacy of language study.
 
Claudina Nunes, beginning -class teacher, spoke of her students'
 
needs: "They should learn
. Portuguese too.  I think It's very
 
enti 6/30/82
 
important that they learn Portuguese like they learn English.'
 
She enumerated the gains of language training:
 "
First thing
 
is this way they 5tudent j can communicate with the family,
 
because, like you see, we got a lot of kids,  they have grand-
parents here and it's sad they cannot deal with grandparents
 
cause they don't know, you know, they don't speak English and
 
they can have some kind of conversation with the kids.
 We
 
think it's sad and they go, you know, so often to Portugal to
 
visit with the family over there and they go,  they don't speak
 
nothing Portuguese.  They don't understand what the family
 
means or they talk about.
 We think this way -
 the English is
 
6
.0 the first language for everybody, but to learn the second
 
language,  their language is going to be better, for the good."
 
Jo31'1 alhiniaa, the teacher of the intermediate class noted that
 
the purpose of the Portuguese school in Taunton was to aid
 
children in speaking and writing Portuguese using proper grarnmar.
 
I
v
Ialhinha foresaw the day when the students, compet ent in both
 
English and Portuguese, would grqduate from colleges and technical
 
schools and would be an asset to the Portuguese community assisting
 
other community members w
cio were not fluent in English.  ae pro-
vided examples from his own personal experience indicating that
 
there were insufficient translators in the area,  ne summarized:
 
'
The idea is we need to teach Portuguese cause around us most
 
f the people is Portuguese.'
 The teacher of the advanced class,
 
Yernando Morai , saw language preservation as the means to pre-
serve culture:  "More or lees, it starts with the parents.
 The
 
parents come  to us and they say 'We want our son or daughter
 
to learn the lang' age and the hLgtc
y.'
 Some of tne e kids were

er

rn
g a
7, some were born here; but there is  this
 
concern on the part of the parents for the children to learn
 
the language,  the correct way to speak fluently, because we
 
want to preserve o
tt' culture and we want them to pass our culture
 
to future generations as well."  Marais elaborated from his own
 
experience:
 "
If the kids are tired the teachers are tired too
 
aughs7I
 We have a whole day's work in our own jobs too.
 
What happenAs is the children only see the present now, but
 
later in life they will say  '
I should have learned Portuguese,
 
why didn't I learn Portuguese?'
 This is an example I see every
 
day 5 nong customers at the store where he work—s7.  I see people
 
from Portuguese descent and they were born in this country and
 
they say 'Why didn't L listen to my grandmother, grandfather?
 
I could have learned the language with them.'"
 
parents see the purpose of the school in both practical and
 
cultural terms.  Cândido Almeida, parent of two school children
 
and a school director, spoke of the general enriching experience
 
of learning several languages, in this case of being able to
 
have contact with the millions of p000le who speak Portuguese,
 
and also of the advantage of bein, bilingual in seeking a better
 
job.  A
Jue.ida also saw his children's learning of "
the language
 
of their ancestors" as a basic part of the preservation of their
 
ethnic heritage,  l
ie desc i ed the preservation of culture as
 
being like constructing a building
;-
 you have to start with a
 
foundation or this building will be destroyed and ne told of
 
language being the foundation of culture.
 With ethnic language
 
fluency Alzrieid
.a noted that an
. ethnic group member would have
 
"roots" and could speak with more "authority."  Another parent
 
Penti 6/3 0/8 2
 
-50-
and school director, Manuel Goulart, noted that he sent his
 
-b
.ildren to Portuguese school to "learn the language so that
 
they would learn their roots."  With the knowledge of Portuguese
 
i
e explained how his children could communicate with their
 
relatives both in the United states (for e ample,  their grand-
parents at the dinner table where only Portuguese was spoken)
 
and in the Old Country.  I
le also hoped his children would be
 
able to help new immigrants arriving in the United States
 
througri their bilingualism.  He said he had noticed his children
 
becoming more curious about their Portuguese heritage while
 
attending Portuguese school and he hoped his sons "will learn
 
our history to pass on to their children."  A third parent and
 
club director, Antonio Batista,  told how he was happy for his
 
children to have two cultures and indeed most parents emphasized
 
their desire that their children live in
. the American setting
 
but continue to retain their Portuguese identity.
 
Students also interpreted their attendance at Portuguese
 
school in terms other than s
i4ply language learning.  Tony
 
Amaral said he went to school "to learn Portuguese and because
 
it s like r
ay background is Portuguese."  His sister 1eresa
 
believed that as an adult she would value her Portuguese school
 
experience:  "I think probably it'll have helped me and I'll
 
realize that it did and make my kids go sometimes Zto Portuguese
 
schoc 7 to make sure it continues and see- that they have it.."
 
Antonio Amaral, school president and father of three students,
 
saw the language training in practical and ethnic heritage terms
 
for his children:
 "
I like for tb
.em to learn the language, first
 
of all,because it's a plus in whatever they become in the future
 
S
 
Penti 6/30/8 2

his own work he has used his fluency in Portuguese, Spanish,
 
and Engl s
/.  Secondly, it's to preserve our  customs and ways
 
and that means a lot because, not that we're different, but
 
every ethnic group is different and we like to have things that
 
we'd like to preserve in our culture."  l
i e provided specific
 
examples of folklore, music, and food.  He elaborated on the
 
school's function: "
I think the school helps by teaching our
 
youngsters our essential things.  You know also by getting them
 
together with one another they lose that shyness that they would
 
have if they were not together.
 In American school, I believe,
 
many of them will avoid to say '
i'm Portuguese' or even to say
 
a word in Portuguese.  But by being together with so I
u ny th
 
speak the same language or think the same way, they night not
 
be ashamed and they might be aware of the fact they're also in-
portant."  Amaral also sees the Portuguese school as serving
 
the local society and country at large:"But, nevertheless, we're
 
doing a service to this country.  In a way we're preparing bet-
tor citizens for the future, because I
'm sure they [Ehe students7
 
are 5oing to stay here for the rest of their lives and giving
 
them extra knowledge of another foreign language which makes it
 
easier £
 or them to learn French or Spanish in the future,  if
 
they want to take those courses in the high school.  It will
 
prepare them better for high school also because they already
 
have experience with a foreign language.  And it keeps them,
 
above all, out of the streets in their free time which is a
 
problem; because most of the kids today don't have anything
 
else to do after school.  If they are out in the street,  they
 
get into problems.  After all, it's a social service.'

Antonio A
r
ral reiterated his belief that an ethnic language
 
and heritage school such as the Taunton Portuguese school was
 
serving the good of the country as he addressed a final inter-
view comment to the American government:
 '
d like to know how
 
the American government sees this project in these private
 
schools .. . .
 They do encouraq
.e or they don't, is that a pro
 
or against the principles.
 I think that's a fair question.
 
To me I think it's a pro, because this country is not any longer
 
a melting pot.
 We all have something different t
o offer and
 
the more we offer, the better t
h country will be.  Right?  We
 
cannot say just the Irish are the good ones or the English,  the
 
South Americans,  or the colored people.  They all have something
 
good and sore thing bad....
 Twenty two years ago, when I came,
 
there was the tendency of we all have to be Anie ican regardless.
 
We all have to melt into it, you know, it was the idea, that
 
ideal.  Then it changed with the bilingual programs and the trying
 
to accept everyone's ideas and cultures which is good.  it's
 
good.  'hat's what made this nation so big, so great.  Right?
 
Was everybody working to the same goals, a better life for every-
body.  That's my comments."
 
The role of the Portuguese school in maintaining the Portuguese
 
ethnic heritage must be judged against the background of the local
 
community.
 It is obvious that the Taunton Portuguese community
 
is vital.
 It is supported by a large number of ethnic institu-
tions such as clubs, churches, and businesses.
 in terms of
 
sheer population figures,  the large numbers of recent i
i
i'a ts
 
(
said to be fif y ?ercont of the total ethnic population) maintain
 
the community's strong ethnic values.
 The cor iunity sense is
 
-
 ant -I
L
. 6/30/82
 
-

reinforced by continued homeland affiliations which are remark-
able in their extent.  Fernando  orais, for example, explained
 
how he knew about 30 people in the '
United states whom he had
 
also known on his home i.land of St. Michael. At school
. he
 
said he would reminisce about Angola with Claudina Nunes
 
who was raised there and even taught in the same school as
 
rs. Morals  (sr. and Mrs. Morals spent the first years of their
 
married life in Angola).  Morais described the sense of commu-
nity: "
For all of us, yes, no matter where you go, you're
 
going to find somebody who you knew or who knew somebody in
 
your family."
 
Every adult interviewed during the project had been born in
 
Portugal or a Portuguese territory. 1hey maintain
 a close
 
relationship to the homeland.
 Visits to Portugal, involving
 
entire families, are common.  Letters are written frequently
 
to family remaining in Portugal.
 Telephone calls are made;
 
for example, Mr. and Mrs. Fernando Morals described how they
 
made monthly, direct-dialed phone calls to relatives in their
 
-home -city of Ponta
. Delgada.
 The immigrants m
.& ntain a deep
 
affection for their homeland which they maintain tb
.rough
.
 
cultural traditions in the United States.
 The home lives
 
of parents,  students, and administrators as well as the func-
tions of the  1'
aunton Sports Club are but two areas where this
 
Portuguese ethnic vitality is evident.
 
This ethnic vitality is both evident in the function of the
 
school and maintained through the operation of the school.
 
Language preservaticn is the means to the end of heritage
 
preservation.  A lack of Portuguese fluency is the most ob-
enti 6/30/82

viously deficient cultural tool in the ethnic repetoire of t
te
 
sons and daughters of Portuguese immigrants.
 Parents see their
 
children speaking English throughout the day at school and play
 
and even at home; the parents may speak Portuguese to their
 
children, but the children reply in English.
 The Portuguese
 
parents recognize their chi ldren 's loss of active language
 
and send them t
o Portuguese school
 
ability.
 The teachers emphasize their students passive know-
ledge of Portuguese and tell how their most difficult challenge
 
lies in getting students  to speak Portuguese fluently.
 
With eth n
ic language t study
 automatically comes cultural
 
knowledge.  Coordinator Emilia Mendonca described the multiple
 
roles of the Portuguese school curriculum:  "The program is
 
not just language and speaking, it is also cultural, basic
 
history also."  With the school's direct teaching methods
 
students study Portuguese culture (in terms of history and
 
social studies) through their language lessons.  The curricu-
lum reinforces Portuguese ethnic heritage.  Fernando Morais,
 
school principal, exDlained: "That's what we're trying to pre-
serve -
 the history,  the customs of each little place all
 
over the country.  That's part of the program to relate to
 
the places  the parents were born, where the child was born."
 
Students come to the Eaunton Portuguese school with signifi-
cant ethnic knowledge having been raised in the vigourous
 
local ethnic com munity by immigrant parents.  The students'
 
main inadequacy as ethnic individuals is their po.or command
 
of the Portuguese language.  Study at the Portuguese school
 
allows them to rectify this deficiency and to gain a supple-
mentary knowledge of Portuguese culture which might might not

be provided automatically.
 The school curriculm inspires
 
the student to investigate his ethnic heritage formally by,
 
for example,  talking to his parents about Portugal for a
 
school assignment or by learning about places he might have
 
visited or will visit in Portugal.
 Not only does he learn
 
about the Old Country.  School excercises, such as the re-
cent Day of Portugal essay and drawing project, allow him
 
to recognize and assess evidences of Portuguese culture in
 
his home community.  The Escola Portuguesa serves to supplement
 
and reinforce Portuguese ethnic values and knowledge witnessed
 
by students in their daily lives.
 Their parents are concerned
 
about an energetic transmission of their ethnic heritage to
 
their children;  they support the school in order to assure
 
cultural maintenance.  Fernando Norais described a typical
 
Portuguese parent's concern:  "
I think I'd like my children to
 
grow as good American citizens, law-abiding citizens, but I
 
also would like them never to forget where they came from,
 
because I would like them to preserve the language and I'd like
 
them to remember some of the good things that happened in the
 
Motherland -
 the customs, the old stories from Gramma."
 
The Portuguese p
.rents look to the school to impart an under-
standing of their ethnic community to their children and to
 
allow their children to develop a strong sense of Portuguese
 
ethnic identity.
 
The graduation ceremony on June 25 served to un derscore
 
the Portuguese sense of co mmunity.
 The highlight of the
 
occasion was  the official visit of the Portuguese Secretary
 
of State for Emigration, Dr. Jose Adriano Gago Vitorino,
 
Penti 6/3 0/8 2
 
- 6-
whose department supplies the funds to support official Por-
tuguese schools in the United states such as the one in Taun-
ton.
 He inaugerated the school addition and gave the key
 
address at graduation speaking to the audience as a brother
 
bringing them the love of their brothers and sisters in Por-
tugal.
 The graduation ceremony rang with words such as the
 
Portuguese community, our culture, our language, and the
 
Portuguese A milT.
 The ceremony was highly emotional with
 
students delivering dramatic interpretations of Portuguese
 
poetry and the honored speakers (Vitorino,  the New bedford
 
Portuguese consul, the president of the Taunton Sports club,
 
a local Portuguese priest, and the school president) praising
 
the community for its work in maintaining the Portuguese
 
heritage through te  vehicle of the school.  As Dr. Vitorin
 
a government dignitary from the homeland, praised the schoc
 
community members could feel rewarded for their endeavors in
 
preserving the Portuguese culture in the United States.
 
The Future of the Schoo l
 
The school anticipates continued growth.  Indeed after the
 
graduation ceremonies, school president Amaral told how next
 
year he hopes to have an additional Tuesday- T
hursday session
 
and noted that a 200 student enrollment could be expected in
 
the future based on the size of the Taunton Portuguese commu-
nity.  To attract students some "advertisement" of the school
 
will be made in the area Portuguese new papers and local Por-
tuguese churches, but there is no concerted campaign intended
 
(Amaral noted th
he prefered to have students come to the
 
school voluntarily:  "
it's available to those who want it.")

Various additional programs are planned such as an adult
 
class.  Fernando Moraja had taught an adult class briediy in
 
the Fall of 1981. There were insufficient students for the
 
class to be feasible economically.  This lack of
 
said to be based on insufficient advertising and
 
that an adult class could be successful in the future judging
 
from the number of adults who recently had inquired about
 
another attempt.
 
Antonio Amaral anticipates a number of developments for the
 
school in the future.
 One is a bus service to bring children
 
to and from school which would alleviate parents' problems
 
in providing transportation at a time of the day when they
 
might still be working,.  Amaral would l
ike to have additional
 
equipment available at the school such as tape recorders and
 
slide projectors which will allow the school to take advantage
 
of additional materials offered by the Ninistry of Education.
 
He hopes to see more non-class activities, such as soccer and
 
the folklore group:
 "Not only is the idea to represent the
 
school within the youth soccer  but it's another way to keep
 
them busy in the afternoon."  l
ie gives as examples of such
 
activities excursions to places important in Portuguese culture
 
such as Portuguese newspapers and Dighton Ro ck or to local
 
attractions  such as the battleships in Fall River.  There
 
is every opportunity for expansion for the school;  Amaral
 
said:  "
It's a million things we can offer if we have the
 
money and facilities."
 
Fieldwork Techniques
  
The informants in this project were most ccoperative and I
 
enti 6/30/8 2
 
_
58-
feel that being a native of the local area served to provide
 
me with initial credibility.  A particular circumstance of
 
this study was to be found in the fact that I came to this
 
project unf amiliar with Portuguese culture (
something which
 
was remedied by reading) and with the Portuguese language
 
(
something which was eased by my college French).  As the
 
informants were bilingual (everyone spoke some English), I
 
was able to feel comfortable in the field situation.  I do
 
not feel that my lack of Portuguese language skills was
 
detrimental to this project.  Compari n
g this work to previous
 
experience I have had in working in a language other than
 
English  and
. where I was fluent in that language, I believe
 
that my unfamiliarity with the Portuguese language and cul-
ture was somewhat advantageous for a project of this type
 
in that it allowed me to distinguish Portuguese ethnic
 
characteristics wi t h  a freshness available only to the outsider.
 
One obvious obstacle in the project was the limitation of being
 
one person attempting to do a study in a relatively short
 
peni6d of time.  Sometimes simple mechanics were problematic
 
such as trying to interview, tape record, and photograph sirnil-
taneously.
 Repeatedly during the course of the fieldwork I
 
also felt stifled by the very limitations of the project.
 As
 
would discover new parameters of the Portuguese ethnic ex-
perience,
 simply could not pursue them because of time limi-
tations.
 
Possible Future Considerations  
A survey such as the Ethnic Heritage and Language Schools
 
Project serves to indicate a variety of avenuesfor future study-

First of all,  an understanding of Taunton Portuguese school
 
would be enhanced by an in-depth study of the local community.
 
The Taunton community lends itself to further analysis by pro-
viding a variety of ethnic differentials within a commu n
ity of
 
approachable size.  Portuguese ethnic identity is complex being
 
rooted in various regional identities which are represented in
 
Taunton such as those of Insular and Continental Portugal as
 
well as those of traditional Portuguese settlements in Angola,
 
Brazil, and Venezuela.
 The 1aunton Portuguese institutions
 
such as etb
.nicclubs, churches, and businesses should be studied
 
in detail to ascertain their role in the maintenance of the
 
Portuguese heritage.  The local festas could be examined as
 
public manifestations of Portuguese ethnicity.
 
Secondly,  Portuguese fznlly
 life should be studied in more
 
detail (in this study only two homes were visited) to determine
 
the process of transmission of Portuguese culture within the
 
home as compared to the transmission manifested in the Portuguese
 
school.  The ethnicity of parents (and also of grandparents
 
to
 
living in the household) should be invest±gate
define parents'
 
roles in shaming the ethn ic id ent
ities  of  their
 children.
 The
 
relative status of Portuguese school and Portuguese culture in
 
the total lives of Portuguese school students should be examined.
 
Parents who do not choose to send their children to Portuguese
 
school, both immigrants and Luso-Americans,  should be interviewed
 
to discover their lack of interest.  Similarly,  Portuguese chil-
dren who do not attend Portuguese school should be interviewed
 
to discover differences and similarities of ethnic understanding
 
as compared to students who do attend Portuguese shool0
 
Penti 6/30/82

In the third place,  the rather unique role of the Portu-
guese government in supporting the Portuguese language and heri-
tage schools in the United States should be examined in detail
 
to reveal the history and the application of this policy from
 
the viewpoint of the Ministry of Education in Lisbon as well
 
as from the viewpoint of the government itself.  The program
 
of support to United States schools should be compared to
 
the support given schools in Europe.  The Ministry coordinator,
 
Emilia Mendon
.ca, should be interviewed more extensively to as-
certain the full extent of her work in the United States.
 The
 
New Bedford Potuguese consul also should be interviewed to
 
understand his relationship to the area Portuguese schools.
 
The Portuguese educational system, which forms the basis of
 
the curriculum of Portuguese official schools in the United
 
States, should be examined in more detail.
 
Finally,  the Taunton Portuguese school should be compared
 
to the local bilingual program.  Many area bilingual teachers
 
have been associated with the Portuguese school and one area
 
of investigation should involve interviews with them.  The
 
Tauntcn school also should be compared to a Portuguese school
 
which has chosen to remain private rather than become official.
 
This study has looked at the exciting first two years of the
 
Taunton school; in the future an additional study of the school
 
should be made to note its development in a historical pers-
pective.
 
Conclusion
  
This study has attempted to document the process of formation
 
of a Portuguese school.  This report endeavors to reveal how
 
Penti 6/30/82
 
-61-
Portuguese immigrant parents, supported by a vigorous local
 
club and a v tal ethnic community as well as aided by their
 
homeland government, have succeeded in establishing an ethnic
 
heritage and language school to facilitate the transmission
 
of the Portuguese cultural heritage to the children of their
 
comirn
.in1ty 0 
In conclusion, I would like to thank the administrators,
 
teachers, parents, students, and friends of the Escola  
Oficializada Portu uesa Do Taunton Sports Club for their
 
generous cooperation.
 Without their kind assistance and con-
tinuous aid,  this project could not have been accomplished.
 
I would like  to offer special thanks to those who provided
 
translation services.
 I finish this project profoundly t
in-
pressed by the commitment and energy expressed by these dedi-
cated individuals to the preservation of their rich culture.
 
It was with great personal pleasure that 1 came to know and
 
respect these members of the  aunton Portuguese community
 
and to appreciate their efforts in the maintenance of the
 
Porttiguese language and ethnic heritage in the United States.

Final Report by Marsha Penti
\
 
Eastern Massachusetts, particularly south—eastern Massachusetts,
 
has been  the site of Substantial Portuguese settlement since the 1
9th
 
century.
V New Bedford and Fail River, L
1assachusetts are well—known as
 
the largest Portuguese communities in the United States. Taunton,
 
Massachusetts, with a population of approximately 45,OU 
CV  aS been home
 
t
o  the third major Portuguese community within the Bristol County area
 
since before World War l
.\
lnformants estimated that Americans born of
 
Portuguese parentage and Portuguese immigrants  i
n Taunton  number iron
 
fifty to s
ixty percent o
f i
ts  total population.
 
The Taunton Portuguese community has grown dramatically in the
 
past two decades as a result of a recent wave of Portuguese
 
immigration. Older community members remember the days when the
 
Portuguese were a minority ethnic group in Taunton;  in 19b0, for
 
example, the Portuguese population was 5 ,695
.
'
41  Today the Portuguese
 
form the largest ethnic community in the city. The existence of a
 
sizeable community base is a prime reason that  the Escola 0f1c1a1iza0j
 
do Taunton Sports Club was founded in 1980.
 
The Taunton Portuguese school in sponsored by the Taunton Sports
 
Club.  It i
s housed in an addition to the club building located in the
 
on the south side of Taunton, in a section known as "Weir Village." As
 
its name suggests,  this club i
s organized around athletics,  namely
 
soccer. Apparently a concern with soccer is a consistent feature of
 
Portuguese Communities  throughout  the world and numerous Portuguese
 
soccer clubs exist in the United -Sta' es. Taunton Sports sponsors three
 
soccer t
eams---the Portuguese school team, a junior team, and an adult
 
team which plays  in the First Division of the Luso-American league
 
(LASA).
 
Each night  I visited the school there was a large number of cars
 
in the parking lot. The cars belonged to waiting school parents,  soccer
 
players, and club members enjoying the fully-licensed bar or
 
participating in functions in the club hail. The club holds periodic
 
fund-raising dinners where Portuguese dishes,  such as cam e de porco a
  
Alentejana (
fried pork with clams), are served; dancing often
 
accompanies the dinners. On weekends the bar's kitchen is open to serve
 
snacks, such as linguica (
Portuguese sausage) sandwiches.  Members'
 
wives attend the club dinners and dances,  although women are not active
 
in the c
lub. Antonio Amaral,  former club president and now school
 
president, explains why.
 
Portuguese women usually never get involved in social
 
affairs. To them it's not right for a lady to go into a
 
club. The American way is different. We have a
 
Portuguese-American club here in town which has an
 
-auxiliary group composed of ladies; but the immigrants
 
normally, I
'm not saying generally, but normally,  they
 
don't believe in women socializing into clubs l
ike
 
that. We would like to and try to [have them
 
participate],  but they just don't go.
 
The club also sponsors some calendrical celebrations.  in February
 
before Lent there i
s ,a carnaval dance at the club.  In the summer there
 
i- ---
is a festa on the club grounds during which ethnic foods are
 
served and dancing takes place. At Christmas there i
s a party for
 
school students and children of club members during which children
 
under thirteen receive a gift from the club.

in addition t
o the soccer teams,  the club sponsors a folklore
 
group —Rancho Foiciorico do Taunton Sports--which performs  traditional
 
dances from all parts o
f Portugal with music provided by its o w n  band.

Athletic Club in 1959.  In 1961 the team became independent,
 
renting i
ts own club on Weir Street. The club purchased its
 
own
 
building on Oak Street in the early 1
970s.  In 1978 t
tie club purchased
 
its present building on Baker Road.
 
There are approximately three hundred dues-paying members of the
 
Taunton.Sports Club; a larger number participates in club activities.
 
According to Antonio Amaral, the membership is "one hundred percent
 
Portuguese immigrants." While many Portuguese clubs in America,
 
particularly in nearby New Bedford and Fall River, are defined by
 
regional Portuguese origin, Taunton Sports has a membership
 
representing all areas of Portugal--continental Portugal,  the Azores,
 
the  1adeiras,  and even the former territory of Angola. There appears  to

because  i
t counteracts discrimination and allows for greater community

The other major Portuguese social club in the city--the
 
Portuguese-American Civic Club (PACC) —requires Portuguese descent or
 
marriage t
o a Portuguese for membership.  It  i
s described as directing
 
i
ts attention towards the Portuguese born i

Luso-Americans.
 
Both clubs share certain responsib i

Taunto0 ' 5  Portuguese community.
 
The Taunton Portuguese Community
 
Before proceeding to a discussion of the school itself,  some
 
background on the Taunton Portuguese community and its  institutions  is
 
necessary, since the school is community based.  Scnool and club meinDers
 
repeatedly emphasized that today the Portuguese live throughout the
 
city. There remains,  however,
 a major traditional area of Portuguese
 
settlement called "The Portuguese Village" or simply "The Village." It
 
is located in t
rie School S
treet area, north of the city center. The
 
PACC building,  several Portuguese markets,  such as Matos Variety and
 
Joe's Superette, other businesses,  and St. Anthony —the main Portuguese
 
parish--are located in this area.
 A second  Portuguese church, Our
 
Lady of Lourdes,  is in the "Weir Village" south of  the city center,
 
where the Taunton Sports Club is  located.
 
5
 
The Portuguese marKets and businesses throughout  the city help to
 
maintain Portuguese traditions. The traditional elements of  the
 
Portuguese diet —linguica,'and a variety of baked goods produced here,
 
as well as imported dried fruits,  canned sardines, and so forth —are
 
easily found in a variety of local Portuguese stores and in the
 
supermarket chains.
 
Ln addition t
o t
he Taunton Sports Club and PACC,  there are several
 
other Portuguese clubs in the city. The Portuguese-American Civic Club
 
i
s the l
argest, with approximately f
ive t
o six hundred members.  The
 
smallest c
lub, with a membership under a hundred,  i
s the Taunton
 
Eagles, a soccer club which developed out of Taunton Sports. The Holy
 
Ghost Club, a religious organization in East Taunton,  has one hundred
 
members. The most recent organization established to promote
 
Portuguese culture in Taunton,  both inside and outside the ethnic
 
community, is the Taunton Organization for the Portuguese-American
 
Community (TOPAC). Since 1
981  its 120 members have assisted newly
 
arrived immigrants with citizenship classes and other activities.
 
Membership in these clubs is non-exclusive and Taunton Sports members
 
may be members of other clubs. The Portuguese Continental Union,  a
 
national Portuguese organization,  also has a Taunton lodge.
 
A major aspect of Portuguese community life occurs during the
 
summer when festas<
rowd the weekend calendar. A fest
may be a simple
 
picnic without calendrical or historical significance,  or it may be a
 
-
 
festival with religious meaning. Families attend the local festas and
 
travel to ones some distance away. The major festa in Taunton is St.
 
6
 
Anthony's, sponsored b
y the L
ocal St. Anthony parish. The festa
 
consists of a church mass,  followed by a religious procession through
 
the surrounding streets of the Portuguese village. Afterwards there i
s
 
a secular segment, during which ethnic and American foods are sold and
 
carnival events take place. Our Lady o
f Lourdes holds a festa in June
 
and
 the Holy Gho
Club has one in July. The Taunton Sports Club holds
 
its festa 
July too.
 
The major secular ceiebratL
 oi  the year uccurred during toe
 
course of the fieldworK--the Day of Portugal, which honors Portuguese
 
culture while commemorating the great Portuguese poet Luis De Camoes.
 
The actual holiday occurs on June 10, but the occasion is marked by
 
week-long festivities.  In 1
982 the festivities began on Saturday, June
 
5 with a flag-raising ceremony on Taunton Green in the city center,
 
followed by a show by local Portuguese artists. A festa ,wAs held in
 
t
tie Portuguese Village on Sunday. The Rancho Folclorico do Taunton
 
Sports and four other invited folklore groups from southeastern
 
Massachusetts and Rhode Island performed. Three soccer games took
 
place on Wednesday evening at the Taunton Sports field, during which
 
the club's three teams participated. Finally, on Thursday, June 10 a
 
dinner and fado performance was held at the PACC. The school children
 
commemorated the occasion with an end-of-the-year project of essays and
 
drawings.

History of the Taunton Portuguese School
 
The Portuguese school was founded in 1
980. Antonio Amaral,
 
president of the school s
ince its inception, played an integral r
ole in
 
i
ts creation. Amaral says that he had thought of f
ounding a school when
 
he was Taunton Sports Club president i
n the mid-1970s,  but was
 
prevented by the lack o
f proper facilities. He finds his interest i
n a
 
Portuguese s
chool natural, b
eing t
he f
ather of four and  wanting his
 
children t
o learn his culture,  language,  and background in an academic
 
way.
 
An organizational meeting was held during February or March 1
9dU
 
t
o discuss the feasibility of the school and assess the means of
 
operation and ti
ne number o
f possible students.  Some twenty-five
 
parents, directors and officers of the Taunton Sports Club,  and
 
b
ilingual t
eachers attended the meeting. The teachers included Joselino
 
Guerreiro, who has continued her interest as present school secretary,
 
and Isaura Amaral, director of both the club's and the school's
 
folklore group.
 
The Escola Oficializada do Taunton Sports Club began classes on
 
November 5
,  1
980. The first year's enrollment numbered forty-two
 
s
tudents. They were divided by age into two classes,  t
aught by Claudina
 
Nunes and Claudina Borges.
 
8
 
During the  i
irst year one  class meL  in the main club hail and  the
 
other met in a small adjacent room. The unsuitability of  the situation
 
inspired the construction of a classroom addition to the club during
 
the summer of 1981. Parents built the school. Antonio Amaral
 
reminisces,  "
every afternoon we used to go there after work,  and every
 
Saturday." School vice-president Jose Goncalves even spent his summer
 
vacation on the construction.  Some of those involved in the work put up
 
some of their own money t
o purchase initial supplies. The only hired
 
help was all  electrician. As a result o
r  the parents'  involvement in
 
the construction,  costs were kept  to $17,OUU.  Funds were raised, and
 
will continue to be raised, through raffles,  dances, and dinners. The
 
school remains in some debt. Antonio Amaral estimates that it will take
 
two years to repay this. Afterwards only general operating expenses,
 
such as electricity and heating, will remain. The school pays no rent.
 
The school addition was inaugurated officially on June 23,  1
982,
 
during the visit of the Portuguese Secretary of Eamiigration, Dr. Jose
'
 
Adriano Gago Vitorino. The children's $IO per month tuition fees should
 
cover utility expenses, as well as each teacher's monthly salary of
 
$100. The school texts,  supporting materials,  such as maps of Portugal
 
for each classroom,  and the academic guidance of Emilia 4endon a are
 
provided free of charge by the Portuguese government. Students are only
 
required to supply their own notebooks;  the school even provides
 
pencils.
 
9
 
The facilities are excellent:  three bright c
lassrooms are
 
furnished with suitable desks,  chairs, and blackboards donated by a
 
l
ocal school. A fourth r
oom i
s used as a meeting room for the storage
 
of texts and school files. An outdoor stairwell is the main entrance to
 
the school, although the addition is connected internally to the main
 
club building.
 
The school's organizers decided trom the beginning to make the
 
Taunton school an official school or Escola Oficializada Portuguesa,
 
seeKing support and r
ecognition from the Portuguese Ministry of
 
Education. The Portuguese government offers singular aid to Portuguese
 
schools in the United States, which includes monetary support, free
 
textbooks, and guidance from a trained coordinator living in this
 
country.  Emilia Mendonca i
s the current Inspectora do Ensino Elemeutar
 
employed by the Service of Basic and Secondary Education for Portuguese
 
Overseas. Working Out  of  the  Port uguese  cons ulate  in  Providence,  Rhode
 
Island, she is the first person to have held this position, having been
 
in the Untied States for two years. There is no cultural agreement
 
between the United States and Portugal which allows her to act as an
 
official inspector. She merely acts as a coordinator for the various
 
official Portuguese schools throughout the United States,  including
 
schools in Massachusetts,  Rhode Island, Connecticut, and California.
 
She visits the Taunton school about once a month, meeting with teachers
 
and administrators.
 
t
o
 
r
iendouca said that the first program for Portuguese living abroad
 
was begun in France in 1
975, and the most recent was started in the
 
United States about  1
977. Portuguese schools in America voluntarily
 
choose t
o accept Portuguese government aid or to remain independent and
 
private.  "
It i
s  not the Portuguese government who's imposing these
 
schools," says Mendonca.  "It's the freedom of the parents that are
 
interested in the education,  to learn the Portuguese culture and
 
language,  that makes the Portuguese government aware that they should
 
be interested and help these schools to go ahead in the right way.  I
t's
 
an answer t
o a call,  t
o the need." The Taunton school has used these
 
services since Lts  inception.
 As Antonio Amaral notes,  "Anything that
 
we need for our school they [
the Portuguese Ministry of Education] will
 
give to us, within reason."
 
Emilia Mendonca i
s a t
rained elementary-school teacher and
 
administrator.  She taught in elementary schools in her native Azores
 
for ten years, and then worked as an administrator in continental
 
Portugal, after taking an advanced course to become an
 
makes pe;iodic reports to the Ministry of Education in
 
throughout the year,  and visits Lisbon once a year t
o make .
 
in-service report.
 
r
4endonca visits  the Taunton school on Wednesday,  attending classes
 
and meeting with teachers for two hours after class to introduce
 
supplementary material to the teachers. The texts sent to official
 
schools from Portugal are the same texts used in homeland schools.
 
Apparently no Portuguese t
eaching materials are published in
 
1
1
 
the United States.  1
'
he materials  1
eudonca presents b
riuhe
 
between the Old Country texts and the American setting. i
Hendonc ,i
 
the supplementary materials herself to explain to t
he teachers
 
teach the youngsters, since Portuguese is their second language
 
actually,  and they have t
o be more precise and direct than if it were
 
their first language. The method used, called "direct teaching,"
 
relates l
essons to daily,  r
ealistic situations. For example, during the
 
April meeting Mendonca presented a lesson plan consisting of a map of a
 
Portuguese city,  showing places, such as the post office and museum,  to
 
aid students on visits t
o the Old Country.  Previously she had given a
 
lesson in which students described their homes in America,  comparing
 
them to houses  in the homeland,  based on knowledge obtained from their
 
parents. Mendonca commented that such lessons combine the teaching of
 
Portuguese language,  history, and culture.
 
An official school must fulfill certain requirements in return for
 
Portuguese-government support.  Seventy-five percent of the school's
 
teachers must be educated in the Portuguese system. Apparently, it has
 
been dif f
icult to find such teachers. The most recent teacher hired is
 
not a local man, and has to drive a considerable distance to class. To
 
gain the approval of the Ministry of Education,  the school has to
 
forward teachers'  credentials and resumes to Portugal via the
 
Portuguese consul in New Bedford. Two of the present teachers are
 
certified and experienced in Portuguese elementary-school teaching. The
 
third has attended a teacher-training school and has taught in Angola,
 
but is not certified. The school is also required to submit periodic

official examination whose successful passage would allow them to  enter

Portugal for the support i
t has given the school. Faced
 
of opening a new school, the founders were happy to accept the
 
supervision and guidance provided by the homeland, as well as the
 
financial support  (
this year's grant amounted to just under $1,500) and
 
textbooks. One parent noted that he was "touched" to see "the poor
 
Portuguese government" wanting to "help us keep our culture and pass
 
our culture to the next ones," and wondered "how can they have the
 
courage to do it?" Another parent contrasted the excellent facilities
 
of  the Taunton school with the crowded classrooms of his boyhood school
 
on Fayal, where sixty to seventy students of all ages were taught in
 
one room by one teacher, wondering how the Portuguese government could
 
manage to support schools in the United States. The teachers especially
 
are grateful for the help provided by the Ministry of Education
 
coordinator.
 As Fernando Morals,  teacher and principal, commented on
 
his  relationship with Mendonca,  "We are in constant touch with each
 
other;  that's why I say it's very useful." If he discovers,  for

Antonio Amaral explains  the interest of  the Por tuguese government
 
beginning,  since  the Discove
-ries.  And a lot of  people
 
have a tendency to look for better days outside, even
 
though sometimes  they could have the same opportunity
 
i
n the country. I guess  it's in our blood. And so they
 
immigrate  to all over  the world. And the Portuguese
 
government,  knowing that,  they would like to continue
 
the culture of those immigrants outside the country. So
 
they promote the culture and the teaching of the
 
Portuguese  language and culture outside of the country.
 
l
ie also point s out  that  the Portuguese government  receives  benefits in
 
return for its policy.  "But you have to keep in consideration that  t
�
­
le
 
immigrants are a big part of income for the country. By tourism and by
 
improving the relationship between the immigrants and the generations,
 
actually they are improving the tourists in the future. That's one of
 
the. reas�ns I have;  perhaps  there are others."

After the initial  1
980 meeting a committee was  formed to begin
 
work on the school.  In the fall of each school year the parents meet to
 
elect  the school's administration,  reflecting the philosophy
 
1
4
 
articuldted by Antonio Amaral:
 The ideal is to have a school run by
 
the parents.
 Amaral i
s president of the school. He i
s assisted by Jose
 
Goncalves,
 vice-president. The school treasurer i
s Joseph Fresta, a
 
leader  in  the  L
ocal Portuguese community who,  in his retirement years,
 
i
s able t
o devote considerable time to the school. The only non-local
 
administrator i
s the secretary, Joselina Guerreiro, a bilingual
 
teacher. All of these officers have been involved with the school since
 
its inception.
 
i
he a
amhllistratjon also includes five elected school directors,
 
many of whom are parents. The entire administration meets about once
 
every three months,  although pressing needs are addressed without a
 
meeting. The administration is  responsible for everything,  including
 
the collection of the S
IO tuition fee from each student.
 
Officers are often in attendance on school nights. Goncalves i
s
 
always present to open and close the school,  as well as to take care of
 
school business,  such as correspondence with the Ministry of Education
 
in Lisbon, in the library. Perhaps he will even call parents of absent
 
students. The school principal, Fernando Morais,  is appointed by the
 
administration and the consul; he assumes responsibility for the
 
educational part of  the school.
 
1

Parents
 
Parents of  school children have been most supportive of  the
 
school. Antonio Amaral sees their interest a
s essential to the future
 
of the school.  "It's to make sure the school goes ahead. Nobody else,
 
more  than the parents, will b
e interested in the kids'  education.
 
Ri g h t ?  We are  there now; one of the reasons I
'm there now i

 Some day .

 i
t will be the  other p a r e n t s
' 
tu r n.
 
There i
s no formal, PTA-like organization at present,  although
 
there are plans  to have one in the future. Parents frequently stop to
 
talk with teachers after class. The teachers say that they enjoy
 
speaking with them. As Principal Morais, who also teaches,  said,
 
That's how I ge t  m y  in f o r m a t i o n.
 That's how I learn a great deal."
 
The parents  receive periodic information on their children's
 
progress through report cards. This close contact is maintained
 
because,  is Morais says,
 I inform the parents of everything that goes
 
on. Everything!  I don't want any surprises." Antonio Amaral observed
 
that,  since Portuguese i
s spoken in the students'  homes,  parents are
 
aware of the children's progress.  "I believe it's easy to keep an i
dea
 
All the parents speak Portuguese, and I believe they can
 
re c o g ni z e
 the  pr o g r e s s  of
 th e  y o u n g  kids."
 
1

Transportation,  t
uition expenses, and home supervision are tie
 
parents'  principle obligations towards the school. Such obligations can
 
occupy significant  t
ime. The reasons some parents do not choose to send
 
their children  C
o school include a lack of tuition money or time to
 
transport their children to and from school. The administration has
 
considered running a bus service t
o assist  transportation.
 
Another explanation for lack of participation on some parents'
 
part was that  recent immigrants were concerned only with the adjustment
 
to American l
ife and t
he l
earning of English. A general apathy t
owards
 
education was cited. Another frequent comment was that student
 
attendance reflected regional differences.  Immigrants from mainland
 
Portugal are more  interested in culture and education. The majority
 
of  the students'  parents were been born on the continent, whereas the
 
majority of Portuguese in the community are from the Azores.
 
All parents interviewed were born in Portugal or a Portuguese
 
territory. Asked why they sent their children to Portuguese school,
 
most parents responded that they wanted them to learn the Portuguese
 
language and to study Portuguese culture and history. One father saw it
 
as an obligation to send his children, saying,  "As a father I should
 
send my children to the school." Another father remembered his first
 
years in America during the late 1950s, when he could not find someone
 
easily who could speak both Portuguese and English;  he hoped his
 
children, as b
ilingual speakers, might be able to help new immigrants.
 
He also viewed his  children's bilingualism as assisting them in finding
 
better jobs.
 
1
7
 
Another common impetus was so that children could communicate with
 
non-English-spea king r
elatives,  both in the United States and i
n the
 
homeland. The occasions f
or speaking Portuguese in America most o
ften
 
mentioned were at the dinner table, in the presence of grandparents5,
 
or at celebratory Portuguese events, such as weddings and festas. Many
 
students have visited Portugal or are intending t
o visit as well. One
 
father spoke of his desire t
o t
ake his children and wife t
o l
ook a
t the
 
house on Fayal in which h
e was born for h
is twenty-fifth wedding
 
anniversary,  he felt h

Classes and Curriculum
 
The school operates Monday and Wednesday evenings from 5
:00 P
.M.  to
 
7
:00 P.M. During the 1
981-82 school year there were sixty-two students
 
enrolled in the school. The s
tudents come primarily from Taunton,
 
although.a few come from neighboring Raynham. A couple of students
 
began classes in the middle of the year, and a few dropped out; but the
 
basic enrollment has r
emained constant.
 
There are three classes--beginning for students from seven t
o
 
eleven years old,  intermediate for the eight  t
o twelve year olds, and
 
advanced for the thirteen- to seventeen-year-old s
tudents —taught
 
respectively by Claudina Nunes, Jose' Maihinha,  and Fernando Morais. The
 
students are divided by age, rather than simply by language ability.
 
i
s
 
During the course of the fieldwork I attended a session of each
 
class. Classes emphasized Portuguese language training, with the chosen
 
texts being analysed word by word. There were also written exercises,
 
including spelling and dictation. Conversation was encouraged as well.
 
The exact lesson content and teaching methods were determined by t
he
 
level of the students and tne judgment of the teacher.
 
The b
eginning class was  devoted to l
anguage study —reading diou,i,
 
writing texts,  spelling words,  ana conversation. Nunes noted that nor
 
greatest problem was to t
each her students to speak Portuguese we l
l.
 
As a result,  she tried to draw students into conversation whenever
 
possible, either during the study of the text or through a discussion
 
about  the children's  families  in Portugual.
 
The intermediate class was  based directly o
il  the day's text,  with
 
students reading the text,  taking dictation, and working on spelling.
 
Comprehension and grammar were emphasized; students also conjugated
 
various verbs and nouns used in the basic text.
 
In the advanced class  t
he lesson,  based on the day's  tex
 
at comprehension of the subject matter,  grammatical understan
 
and proper spelling. Morais tried to draw his students into Portuguese
 
conversation throughout the class because he feels student skills in
 
this area are most in need o
t attention.
 
MY observation  c
orroboratea b
y i
ntervie ws with t
eaciers,  r
evealed
 
the major emphasis of the school t
o b
e Portuguese—language training.
 
Because most students l
acked Portuguese f
luency, the c
lass level in
 
Portuguese school was l
ower than i
n American schools. History and o
ther
 
subjects were taught i
n the school, but they t
ypically constituted an
 
indirect approach to general language instruction.  In the beginning
 
Cl as s,
 for example, there was a discussion of a project in which
 
students would write letters t
o their families in Portugal.  Students
 
drew comparisons between e
lements of l
ife in Portugal and the United
 
States  throughout  the discussion.  "All we do here i
s t
o compare America
 
t
o Portugal.  .
 , "
 says Claudina Nunes.  "
Something we got in America,
 
we got in Portugal. You know,  they are just kids, but I choose the
 
easier way to take them t
o Portugal, in thinking." On the n
ight I
 
observed the class such comparisons were made by students who actually
 
h
ad visited Portugal.
 
Again in the intermediate class actual language learning was
 
emphasized and other subjects entered the lesson obliquely. For
 
explained some basic science concerning the sun a
s
 
part of text comprehension. He also made a comparison to the homeland
 
while discussing the t
ext, noting that one could not see the sea in
 
Taunton, but that in the Azores "all the t
ime we see the sea around
 
us." He explained that subjects such as mathematics were left for
 
American schools,  and Portuguese history was done ia the advanced
 
class;  in this classroom h
istory was mentioned only to elucidate a
 
20
 
particular t
ext,  because t
eaching Portuguese history i
s difficult.
 e
 
have a b
ig problem with Portuguese history,  'cause it's more than eight
 
hundred years.
 
Fernando  4
ordis,  t
eacher of the advanced class and school
 
principal, elaborated on the subjects taught in the Portuguese school.
 
He emphasized that the basic subject was  l
anguage  I
tselt.
 Each class
 
includes  r
eading,  spelling,  conversation
 and social studies, which t
i
e
 
defines as "The way the people live in Portugal,.  .
 .
 where the
 
Population i
s .
 .
 ,
 the Portuguese climat e , the oain products  frown,
 
the main source of Portuguese income." Only the advanced class studies
 
Portuguese history as a separate subject.
 
As previously noted, t
he  t
exts are provided free of charge by t
he
 
Portuguese Ministry of Education,  except for a few purchased in a
 
Bedford Portuguese bookstore when the school began. Many bear
 
a Taunton Sports stamp -- ESCOLA OFICIAL DO ENSINO PRIMARIO DO TAUNT
 
SPORTS CLUB,  INC.! BAKER ROAD/TAUNTON, MASSACHUSETTS 02780--and the
 
Portuguese Ministry of Education stamp--OFERTA/INSTITUTO DE CULTURA E
 
LINGUA PORTUGUESA SERVICOS DE ENSINO BASICO E SECUNDARIO PROTUGUES NO
 
ESTRANGEIRO. The paperback texts are colorful,  recent publications from
 
the late 1
970s and later. All of the texts are used in schools in
 
Portugal as well.
 
Until just before my f
ieldworK began there had not  been sufficient
 
texts for each class. Trying to treat each school equally,  the
 
Portuguese consulate forwarded only three to five copies of a text,
 
2
1
 
f
orcing t
he t
eacher t
o u
se several t
exts i
n one class, or LO MdKe
 
offset copies for each s
tudent. The teachers are encouraged t
hat there
 
are now f
inally enough c
opies of texts for each class. The Ministry o
f
 
Education also has provided a map of Portugal, dictionaries, and
 
l
iterary works for each c
lassroom.
 
Those i
nterviewed emphasized that all t
eachers are free t
o choose
 
the text and specific lesson they wish. Sometimes teachers proceed
 
sequentially through a particular book; at other t
imes they may sKip
 
from t
ext t
o text.
 
Fernando Morais noted that he chose suitable l
essons which would
 
be understandable to his students. For cases in which aspects o
f the
 
lesson were foreign to his students, he acted as a bridge between the
 
Portuguese setting of the book and the American setting of the
 
students. Morais gave the example of encountering t
exts which mentioned
 
birds native to Portugal but not to the United States, which he
 
described b
efore proceeding with the text.
 
Just a
s the teacher acts as a bridge between text and student,  the
 
Portuguese Ministry of Education coordinator, Emilia Mendonca, also i
s
 
faced with the job of adapting curriculum to the American setting. At
 
the monthly meeting with teachers she presents materials she has
 
written for Portuguese schools in the United States. During the April
 
meeting which I observed she explained several sets of duplicated pages
 
to the t
eacoers,  including a map lesson to familiarize students
 
with a typical Portuguese environment and an exercise which allowed
 
them to purchase a stamp or bus t
icket.
 
Teachers  i
re actively involved in the process of selecting
 
appropriate books.  Fernando Morais showed me one book,  Imagens de  
Portugal, whicti had impressed him as particularly valuable--"In other-
words, by reading this book the person i
s going back home,  like on d
 
trip." There are only a couple of copies of this book available; as a
 
consequence,  he has been able to use it only in a l
imited way. He is
 
ordering copies  for each of his students for next year, as well as  for
 
interested parents. The book describes each part of Portugal,
 
presenting traditional r
ecipes and songs.
 
Several of  the books sent by the Portuguese  Ministry of Education
 
are not actual texts,  but are books on subjects such as the selected
 
texts of the famous poet Lu!s De Camo's.  In the future the books sent
 
from Portugal may serve as the basis of a Portuguese library for
 
students, parents,  and interested members of the community.
 
The three teac ers s
tressed tOe difficulty of teaching only four
 
hours a week at a time of day when the children are tired. The student
 
come to Portuguese school having already spent a full day in America
 
schools, attending the school at  their customary dinner hour. Nunes and
 
Morais both said they worked to gain students' attention through games.
 
Claudina Nunes,  for example, divides her class into two teams which
 
compete in a dictation exercise at the blackboard. The children
 
23
 
obviously l
oved toe exercise and cheered when she announced it. Nunes
 
also places examples of the best student work on the classroom walls.
 
"They get so excited, and this way I think I can take their attention
 
to what I am doin g,
" she says of her methods.
 
Morals ran a weeK-to-week spelling contest for his advanced
 
students, with each student competing for individual points The four
 
winners received a copy of one of the general books sent from Portugal.
 
Judging from the  intense discussion by students concerning the contest
 
rules,  i
t was clear that N
iorais gained their attention.
 
A constant  theme expressed by both parents and teachers was the
 
intention that Portuguese school work should not interfere with
 
students' American school work. The Portuguese school teachers
 
never gave any homework assignments to their students until recently.
 
They are now experimenting with limited amounts of homework. For
 
example, Morais asked for four-sentence essays, and was pleased with
 
the results.  "Usually I ask them to do things which get them together
 
with their parents on finding out things about the Old Country--old
 
stories,  traditions," he explains.  "That way,  father and son,  father
 
and daughter get together and talk about old.  .
 . ,
 the things in their
 
motherland. The kids can learn an awful lot by doing that."
 
Certain special projects are carried on throughout the school
 
year. The advanced class made drawings depicting Portuguese emigration
 
around the world which were sent to the Ministry of Education in Lisbon
 
24
 
to compete with those o
f Portuguese school students outside the
 
homeland. Other projects of limited length included the one undertaken
 
by the b
eginning class of preparing its own newspaper 0 Nosso Jornal.
 
The major project of the school year was in honor of the Day of
 
Portugal on June  10. This year's theme, announced in Lisbon, was 'Ttie
 
Day of Portugal and Portuguese Communities." Principal Fernando Morals
 
selected as the school's essay theme "Please explain in your own words
 
in what way have the Portuguese contributed to the development in our
 
community.
 Students also made drawings on the theme. The essays and
 
drawings were displayed in the school's hallway for viewing by parents
 
and friends during the Day of Portugal soccer games held at  the club
 
on June 9 and after graduation on June 25.
 
The drawings depicted Portuguese-owned neighborhood markets,
 
garages, and furniture stores;  the Portuguese school itself;  various
 
Portuguese occupations in the area, such as fishing, farming, and
 
factory work; and Portuguese homes with grapevines in the yard. The
 
essays described how the hard-working Portuguese are employed in local
 
factories or operate their own businesses. They described elements of
 
the ethnic community communications system, such as Portuguese
 
newspapers,  radio stations,  and television programs, soccer,  and
 
festas. The pervasive influence of Portuguese food on the surrounding
 
population was also a constant theme. The Portuguese consul was so
 
impressed by the work that he awarded special certificates for first
 
and second prizes in the drawing and essay category from each class
 
during the graduation ceremony.

t
 
Steve Almeida, an eighth-grader in the advanced class,  described
 
the Portuguese community in a prize-winning essay translated for me by
 
Fernando Morais:
 
The dream of  the Portuguese when he goes to a different
 
country is t
o improve and better his way of life. When
 
h
e arrives, he works hard, saves his money, and makes
 
lots of sacrifices in order -
to make his dreams come
 
t
rue. The Portuguese immi grant i
s a hard worker, he
 
l
ikes  to pay his debts,  because he is honest and proud.
 
He wants to have n
ice and beautiful things and he keeps
 
his name clean. Lots of Portuguese buy old houses. They
 
make improvements and they become just like new. Other
 
Portuguese have their own businesses, for instance,
 
Antonio Amaral, Mr. Caramelo, and Jose Fernandes,  and
 
many others. Others go to school and study. Later they
 
become lawyers, doctors,  teachers, and priests. One of
 
the most important figures is Cardinal Humberto
 
Medeiros, Others work in markets, factories, and
 
offices. The streets where the Portuguese live keep
 
looking much b
etter. The houses have been improved.
 
There are beautiful gardens,  beautiful statues of
 
saints near the b
eautiful houses. The Portuguese like
 
t
o maintain their traditions;  that's why we have our
 
festas, mostly religious,  at St. Antonio Church and
 
Nossa Senhora de Lourdes,  at the PACC, Taunton Sports,
 
and our school, and the Day of Portugal.
 
Student Language Capabilities
 
S
tudents conic  to the Portuguese school with a previous knowledge
 
of Portuguese. The majority of  students have parents'
 born in Portugal
 
and many were born in Portugal themselves. The typical home situation
 
finds students hearing their parents and grandparents speak Portuguese
 
while they reply in English. Antonio Amaral talked about such a
 
situation in his family.  "We always speak Portuguese. The kids answer
 
26
 
in English. We are so i
nvolved that we sometimes don't r
ecognize that
 
they're speaking English back to us. The two languages work
 
simultaneously. We don't try to correct them,  that's why they
 
understand; but they're kind of  lazy speaking it,  'cause they're afraid
 
it's not coming out."
 
The primary aim o
f t
ue Portuguese school appears to be to provide
 
the students with an increased fluency in Portuguese.  "In this school
 
that's what we're doing--we're pursuing the improvement in the
 
Portuguese language," says principal N
iorais.
 
We want them to learn and improve. But, of course, we
 
know the Portuguese language is going to be their
 
second language. We want to maintain our culture,  and
 
our customs, and everything, but we have to realize
 
that English is the first language and Portuguese will
 
be their second language.  But, of course, when they
 
meet Portuguese people,  they socialize in Portuguese
 
functions and they are going to use .
 .
 .
 the
 
Portuguese language. It won't be lost there. They know
 
how to communicate and they know how to deal with those
 
things
 
The s
tudents'  prime fluency in English intrudes upon the classroom
 
situation and general school environment. One night, while setting up a
 
tape recorder before class,  I overheard some girls having an English
 
conversation  in  the classroom. A boy entered the room,  took a look at
 
me,  and  told the girls,  "This is a Portuguese school, not English!" One
 
girl replied that  class had not begun and continued to  speak English.
 
2
7
 
Students always spoke English with one another b
efore and after
 
class. During class students continued to address each other in
 
English. Claudina Nunes,  l
ike the other teachers, found it impossible
 
to limit classes to Portuguese language usage.  "We can never get
 
this from the kids," she says,  "because they already have the idea to
 
speak in English,  even i
f they are joking or anything. They just try to
 
speak English .
 .
 . ,
 they just speak English. All the time I say,  '
No
 
English, just Portuguese!'  But forget i
t!"
 
English fluency creates certain di fficulties in learning
 
Portuguese. Advanced students, for example,  already have a good
 
knowledge of English grammar, which may confuse them at times. Morals
 
laughed as he told how he would explain certain grammatical rules and
 
students would tell him,  "No, you are wrong!" based on their
 
understanding of English grammar.
 
In his short time at the school the intermediate teacher Jose'
 
Maihinha has seen progress in the reading and writing abilities of his
 
students.. Morals,  the teacher of the advanced class, gauges the
 
improvement of his students by the fact that he no longer has to remind
 
them continually not to speak English.  "At first they were shy I
to
 
speak Portuguese]. Now every day they are more and more comfortable.'
 
2
 
Students
 
The students have f
ixed a
ttitudes t
owards a
ttending Portuguese
 
school. They frequently explained that they go t
o Portuguese school
 
because t
heir parents want them to go; yet there o
thers who were
 
excited about Portuguese school and said they would attend without
 
parental urging.  Most t
eachers and administrators, though, would agree
 
with Fernando Morais's assessment:  "I b
elieve a good part of then are
 
there b
ecause tneir parents want thea t
 b
e.
 
Since the Portuguese l
ive throughout the city,  s
tudents may come
 
to school without knowing other students. The children are able t
o meet
 
new friends at the school and develop their friendship network with
 
Portuguese affiliation. "
I guess in this school everybody has something
 
in  common with you '
cause you're Portuguese and the same thing a
t home.
 
Whereas in [
high] school your culture i
s different from everyone
 
else's, and you might not have as many things in common," explains
 
Teresa Amaral, a student in the advanced class. Students ar
 
enthusiastic about the new friends they have made through
 
school, and talked of t
elephoning their friends or even visiting them
 
at home. Other students said they had the same friends in both
 
Portuguese and American school.
 
Speaking of what they have learned at Portuguese school, s
tudents
 
emphasized language skills, mentioning improvements in writing
 
(especially spelling) and speaking. Steve 'Umeida felt he had improved
 
in his Portuguese reading and writing skills, but thought his greatest
 
29
 
Progress was in O
hs speaking skills. Teresa Amaral was enthusiastic
 
about her improved Portuguese skills, especially her ability to write
 
letters t
o a girl she had met on a recent trip to Portugal. Parents
 
also told of seeing children reading Portuguese newspapers in the home,
 
or of noticing their improved comprehension of the language at
 
functions such as plays performed in Portuguese.
 
Teachers
 
Without exception t
eachers indicated that  they taught in the
 
Portuguese school out of love for teaching and love for their culture
 
The teachers'
 100 a month salary certainly does not compensate
 
them for their efforts of teaching classes,  attending teachers'
 
meetings and school functions, and preparing and grading lessons at
 
home. All of them hold full-time jobs outside of Taunton and have to
 
rush to arrive at school on time.
 
Fernando Morais expressed the wish that he could teach full time,
 
rather than work as a manager at Christy's Market.  "I'll be planning to
 
teach for as long as I can. I love this!" Claudina Nunes, who provides
 
a warm, maternal guidance for her young students,  comes to the school
 
tired from a day's work as a machine operator. After class she resumes
 
her home duties by cooking supper. The vitality she exhibits in class
 
fades when she leaves the school.  "Over here I
'm just excited,  1
1 don't
 
feel nothing.  But when I get out of here,  oh my God!' Jose 
.

The t
eachers  posses the background o
f teacher's training and
 
t
eaching experience in the Portuguese elementary school system r
equired
 
by the Portuguese Ministry of Education. All three teachers emigrated
 
t
o the United States as adults, accompanied by their immediate
 
f
amilies. While they have had experience in the Portuguese system,  r
iO o
 
were familiar with the t
extbooks now u
sed in the Portuguese school i
n
 
Taunton.  f
alhinha explained that there was only one official book for
 
each class b
efore the 1
976 r
evolution in Portugal; but numerous b
ooks
 
have been written since.
 
Despite some adaptation  t
he currfcu Lim o
f  t
he • ici  l
 
Portuguese school in Taunton i
s rooted firmly in the Portuguese system.
 
I
 
Jose Maihinha made some interesting comparisons between the two
 
systems, however. Throughout the class I observed he made comments
 
contrasting procedures in Portuguese school with those in Americai
 
schools. He observed that Portuguese students write in script on
 
standard-size paper, while American students print on all types of
 
paper. He was also surprised that his present students chew gum in
 
class; in homeland schools there is strict discipline. There is,
 
nevertheless,
 considerable discipline in the Taunton Portuguese
 
school, reinforced by parental cooperation. One mother was overheard
 
telling a teacher to pull her son's ears i
f he did not behave, and a
 
M
 
Young boy commented that the main difterence between Portuguese and
 
American schools was that  the Portuguese school teachers are more
 
s
 t
 r
 i
 c
 t
 .
 
The  teachers meet monthly after a Wednesday class. EmiLia Mendonca
 
usually attends  these meeting to introduce supplementary materials.
 
Principal Morais leads  these sessions in her absence. There is  no
 
interaction with teachers  from other Portuguese schools  in  the drea.
 
Considering  t
ile American settl
-ng,  the  requirements  tor  te ac �
j
ers
 
are somewhat demanding — copies of  teachersy  certificates of graduation
 
and resumes must  be forwarded to the Ministry of Education in Lisbon by
 
the New Bedford Portuguese consul for approval. This process  takes
 
several months and,  therefore,  the school began without appr
 
teachers have been approved to date and the school has not �
i
 
up
 its official status.  Principal Morais feels that finding additional
 
teachers will not  be a problem.  When one second-year teacher was forced
 
to quit suddenly at  the end of the year, he located his former
 
classmate-Malhinha, whom he knew was qualified.

Purposes of the School
 
The pr i ma r y
 re as o n  gi ve n  fo r  the  exi s t e n c e  of  tne school is
 
la ng u a ge  ins t r u c t i o n.  The teachers are very conscious of the importance
 
of language study.  "They should learn Portuguese too.  I think it's ver;
 
important that  they learn Portuguese like they learn English," says
 
b
eginning class  teacter C
lauiina Nunes.
 
First  thing i
s,  this way they can communicate with t
rie
 
family.  Because,  l
ike you see, we got a lot of kids,
 
they have grandparents here, and it's sad they cannel
 
deal with grandparents  'cause they don't know, you
 
know,  they don't speak English.  .
 .
 .
 We think think
 
it's sad. And they go, you know, so often to Portuga.
 
to visit with the family over there, and [when]  they
 
go,  they don't speak nothing Portuguese. They don't
 
understand what the family .
 .
 .
 means or they talk
 
about. We think this way--the English is  .
 .
 .
 the
 
first language for everybody, but to learn the second
 
language,  their language, is going to be better,  for
 
the good.
 
Malhinha forsees the day when the students, competent in both
 
English and Portuguese, will graduate from colleges and technical
 
schools and will be an asset to the Portuguese community, assisting
 
other community members who are not fluent in English. Fernando Morais
 
feels language preservation is a means of preserving culture.  "More or
 
less,  it starts with the parents," he says.  "The parents come to us,
 
and they say  'We want our son or daughter to learn the language and the
 
history.' Some of  these kids were born there  [
Portugal].  Some were born
 
here. But there is  this concern on the part of the parents for the
 
children t
o learn the  language,  the correct way t
o speak fluently,
 
33
 
because we want  to  preserve our  ouLture aud we want  t
h em to  pass our
 
culture to future generations a
s well." Elaborating from his own
 
exPerience, he adds:
 
L
L  the Kids are  t
irec, the t
eacriers are t
ired too
 
l laughs j
! We have a whole day's work in our own jobs
 
t
oo. What happens i
s the children only see the present
 
i
ow. But later in l
ife they will say '
.1 should have
 
l
earned Portuguese, why didn't I learn Portuguese!?"
 
This is an example I see everyday. I see people from
 
Portuguese descent, and they were born in this country,
 
and they say "
Why didn't I listen to my grandmother,
 
randfather? I could have l
earned the language with
 
them."
 
Parents view the purpose of  the  school in  both practical and
 
cultural terms. C
.'ndido Alnieida,  parent of two school children and a
 
school director himself, spoke of the general enriching experience o
f
 
learning several languages. Almeida also sees his children's learning
 
"
the language of their ancestors" as a basic part of the preservation
 
of their ethnic heritage, He described the preservation of culture as
 
being like constructing a building--you have to start with a foundation
 
or the building will be destroyed —and language i
s the foundation of
 
culture.
 
Antonio Amaral, school president and father of three students,
 
sees his children's language training in practical and ethnic-heritage
 
terms.  "1 like for them to learn the language,  f
irst of all, b
ecause
 
i
t's a plus in whatever they become in the future, Secondly,
 
to
 
preserve our customs and ways, and that means a lot because, n
ot that
 
we're different,  but every ethnic group i
s different. And we l
ike t
o
 
have things that we'd like to preserve in our culture." Later he
 
elaborated on the school's function.
 I think the school helps by
 
-
3
4
 
t
eaching our youngsters aur e
ssentIal t
hings, YO U  K
now. Also, b
y
 
getting them together with one another,  they lose that shyness that
 
they would have if they were not t
ogether.  In American school,  I
 
believe, many of them avoid to say '
I'm Portuguese,' or even to say a
 
word in Portuguese. But by being together with so many that speak the
 
same language or think the same way,  they might not be ashamed, and
 
they night b
e aware of t
he f
act they're also important.
 
Amaral a
lso sees t
i
le Portuguese school a
s serving Lne  i) C lr
 
Society and country at l
arge:
 
But, nevertheless, we're doing a service t
o this
 
country. In a way we're preparing better citizens for
 
the future, because I
'm sure they [
the students]  are
 
going to stay here for the rest of their lives.  And
 
giving them extra knowledge of another foreign
 
language, makes i
t easier for them to learn French  )
r-
Spanish in the future, if they want to take those
 
courses in the high school.  I
t will prepare them better
 
for high school also, because they already have
 
experience with a foreign language. And it keeps them,
 
above all, out of the streets in their free time, which
 
is a problem because most of the kids today don't have
 
anything else to do after school.  I
f they are out in
 
the street,  they get into problems. After all, it's a
 
social service.
 
Reiterating his belief that an ethnic language and heritage
 
school, such as the Taunton Portuguese school,  serves the good of
 
the country, Amaral addressed a final interview comment to the American
 
g o v e r n me nt:
 
I
'd l
ike to know how the American government sees  this
 
project in these private schools.  .  .  .  They do
 
encourage or they don't? Is that a pro or against the
 
principles? I think that's a fair question. To me,  I
 
think it's a pro, because this country is not any
 
longer a melting pot. We all have something different
 
to offer, and the more we offer, the better the country
 
3
5
 
will be. Right? We cannot say just the i
rish are the
 
good ones, or the English, the South Americans, or the
 
colored people. They all have something good and
 
something bad.
 
Twenty—two years ago, when I came, there was the
 
tendency that we all have to be American regardless. We
 
all have to melt into it, you know, it was the idea,
 
that ideal. Then i
t changed with the bilingual programs
 
and the trying t
o accept everyone's ideas and cultures,
 
which is good. It's good! That's what made this nation
 
so big, so great — r
ight ?
-._wa5 everybody working to the
 
same goals —a better life for everybody. That's my
 
comments.
 
The r
ole of  the Portuguese school in maintaining the Portuguese
 
ethnic heritage must b
e judged against the background of the local
 
community. The graduation ceremony on June 25 underscored the
 
Portuguese sense of coimimunity. The highlight of the occasion was the
 
official visit by Dr. Jose'Adrjano Gago Vitorino, the Portuguese
 
Secretary of State for Emigration, whose department supplies the funds
 
to support official Portuguese schools i
n the United States. He
 
inaugurated the school addition and gave the key graduation address.
 
The graduation ceremony rang with culturally important phrases, such as
 
"Portuguese community," "our culture," "our language," and "the
 
Portuguese family." Students delivered dramatic interpretations of
 
Portuguese poetry, and the honored speakers —Dr. Vitorino,  the New
 
Bedford Portuguese consul, the president of the Taunton Sports Club, a
 
local Portuguese priest, and the school president —praised the
 
co mmunity  for  its  work in maintaining the Portuguese heritage through
 
their school.
 
36
 
Future of the Escola Oficializada Portuguesa
 
do Taunton Sports Club
 
The school anticipates continued growth. After t
he graduation
 
ceremonies school president Amaral said that next year he hopes t
o have
 
an additional Tuesday and Thursday session. He also noted that, based
 
on the size of Taunton's Portuguese community, a 200-student enrollment
 
could be expected in the future. Some advertisements o
f  the school will
 
be placed in Portuguese newspapers and churches in the area t
o attract
 
students, but no concerted campaign will be launched. Amaral prefers t
o
 
have students come to the school voluntarily.  "It's available t
o those
 
who want i
t."
 
Amaral would like t
o have tape recorders and slide projectors
 
available at the school to take advantage of additional materials
 
offered by the Ministry of Education. He also hopes to develop
 
extracurricular activities in addition to the soccer team and folklore
 
group for the students.  "It's a million things we can offer i
f we have
 
the money and facilities."
 
Fieldwork Techniques
 
The informants in this project were most cooperative.  I feel that
 
being a native of the area helped to provide credibility for me. I came
 
to this project unfamiliar with Portuguese culture, which I remedied
 
through research,  and with the Portuguese language, although I did have
 
my college French.  Since all of my informants spoke some English, I was
 
3
7
 
able to feel comfortable i
n the f
ield s
ituation and do not feel that  my
 
lack of Portuguese was detrimental to the project. Comparing this work
 
to my previous experience of working in a language other than English
 
in which I was fluent,  I believe that my unfamiliarity with the
 
Portuguese language and culture was advantageous to the project--it
 
allowed me t
o  i
lstLugutstl Portuguese ethnic characteristics  from the
 
perspective o

Final Report by Z
4arsha Penti
 
Eastern Massachusetts, particularly s
outheastern Massachusetts,
 
has been the site of substantial Portuguese settlement since the 1
9th
 
century.
/ New Bedford and Fall River, Massachusetts are well known a
s
 
the largest Portuguese communities in the United States. Taunton,
 
&
#
 
Massachusetts, with a population of   
 
45 ,OOV
has been home
 
t
o the third major Portuguese community within the Bristol County area
 
since before World War I
.\ /1nformants estimated that Americans born of
 
Portuguese parentage and Portuguese immigrants in Taunton number from
 
fifty to sixty percent of i
ts total population.
 
The Taunton Portuguese community has grown dramatically in the
 
past two decades as a result of a recent wave of
 
immigration. Older community members remember the days when the
 
Portuguese were a minority e
thnic group in Taunton; in 1
960,  for
 
example, the Portuguese population was 5695.\4/ Today the Portuguese
 
form the largest ethnic community in the city. The existence of a
 
sizeable community base is a prime reason that the Escola Oficializada
 
do Taunton Sports Club was f
ounded in 1
980.
 
The Taunton Portuguese school in sponsored by the Taunton Sports
 
Club. It i
s housed in an addition to the club building located in t
b
 
on the south side of Taunton, in a section known as "Weir Village." A
 
its name suggests,  this club is organized around athletics, namely
 
soccer. Apparently a concern with soccer is a consistent featur e of
 
Portuguese communities throughout the world and numerous Portuguese
 
soccer clubs exist in the United States. Taunton Sports sponsors three
 
2
 
s
occer teams--the Portuguese school team, a junior team, and an adult
 
team which plays in the First Division of the Luso-American league
 
(LAsA).
 
Each night I visited the school there was a large number of cars
 
in the parking lot. The cars belonged t
o waiting school parents, soccer
 
players, and club members enjoying the fully-licensed bar or
 
participating in functions in the club hall. The club holds periodic
 
fund-raising dinners where Portuguese dishes, such a
s cam e de porco a
  
Alentejana (fried pork with clams), are served; dancing often
 
accompanies the dinners. On weekends the bar's kitchen is open t
o serve
 
snacks, such as linguica (
Portuguese sausage) sandwiches. Members'
 
wives attend the club dinners and dances, although women are not active
 
in the club. Antonio Amaral, former club president and now school
 
president, explains why.
 
Portuguese women usually never get involved in social
 
affairs. To them it's not right for a lady to go into a
 
club. The American way is different. We have a
 
Portuguese-American club here in town which has an
 
auxiliary group composed of ladies; but the immigrants
 
normally, I
'm not saying generally, but normally,  they
 
don't believe in women socializing into clubs like
 
that. We would like to1 and try t
o [have them
 
participate], but they just don't go.
 
The club also sponsors some calendrical celebrations.  In February
 
before Lent there is a carnaval dance at the club. In the summer there
 
i
s a festa or festival on the club grounds during which ethnic f
oods
 
are served and dancing takes place. At Christmas there is a party for
 
school s
tudents and children of club members during which children
 
under thirteen receive a gift from the club.

In addition to the soccer teams,  the c
lub sponsors a folklore
 
group--Rancho Foiclorico do Taunton Sports--which performs traditional
 
dances from all parts of Portugal with music provided by its own band.
 
The group performs at the club's festa and other Portuguese functions
 
in the area, a
s well as at non-Portuguese events,  such as picnics of
 
l
ocal businesses.
 
History of the Taunton Sports Club
 
The Taunton Sports Club began as a soccer team affiliated with the
 
Ward 5 Athletic Club in 1
959. In 1961 the team became independent,
 
renting its own club on Weir Street. The club purchased its own
 
building on Oak Street in the early 1
970s. In 1978 the club purchased
 
its present building on Baker Road.
 
There are approximately three hundred dues-paying members of the
 
Taunton Sports Club; a larger number participates in club activities.
 
According £
6 Antonio Amaral, the membership is "one hundred percent
 
Portuguese immigrants." While many Portuguese clubs in America,
 
particularly in nearby New Bedford and Fall River, are defined by
 
regional Portuguese origin, Taunton Sports has a membership
 
representing all areas of Portugal--continental Portugal, the Azores,
 
the Madeiras, and even the former territory of Angola.-There appears t
o
 
4
 
be a general consensus that such a varied membership i
s preferable
 
because i
t counteracts discrimination and allows for greater community
 
cooperation. Even non-Portuguese can join.
 
The other major Portuguese social club in the city —the
 
Portuguese-American Civic Club (PACC)--requires Portuguese descent or
 
marriage to a Portuguese for membership. It is described as directing
 
i
ts attention t
owards the Portuguese born in America, the
 
Luso-Americans.  Both clubs share certain responsibilities towards
 
Taunton's Portuguese community.
 
The Taunton Portuguese Community
 
Before proceeding to a discussion of the school itself, some
 
background on the Taunton Portuguese community and its institutions i
s
 
necessary, since the school is community based. School and club members
 
repeatedly emphasized that today the Portuguese live throughout the
 
city. There remains, however,  a major-'
traditional area of- Portuguese
 
settieme
 called "The Portuguese Village" or simply "The Village." It
 
i
s located in the School Street area, north of the city center. The
 
PACC building, several Portuguese markets, such as Matos Variety and
 
Joe's Superette, other businesses, and St. Anthony--the main Portuguese
 
parish —are located in this area.  A second  Portuguese church, Our
 
Lady of Lourdes, is in the
-Weir Village  south of the city center,
 
where the Taunton Sports Club is located.
 
5
 
The Portuguese markets and businesses throughout the city help to
 
maintain Portuguese traditions. The traditional elements of the
 
Portuguese diet--linguica and a variety of baked goods produced here,
 
a
s well as imported dried fruits, canned sardines, and so forth —are
 
easily found in a variety of local Portuguese stores and in the
 
supermarket chains.
 
In addition to the Taunton Sports Club and PACC, there are several
 
other Portuguese clubs in the city. The
- Portuguese-American Civic Club
 
i
s the largest, with approximately five to six hundred members. The
 
smallest club, with a membership under a hundred,  i
s the Taunton
 
Eagles, a soccer club which developed out of Taunton Sports. The Holy
 
Ghost Club, a religious organization in East Taunton, has one hundred
 
members. The most recent organization established to promote
 
Portuguese culture in Taunton, both inside and outside the ethnic
 
community, is the Taunton Organization for the Portuguese-American
 
,Community (TOPAC). Since 1
981 its 120 members have assisted newly
 
arrived immigrants wi-th ditizenship classes and other activities.
 
Membership in these clubs i
s non-exclusive and Taunton Sports members
 
may be memb rs of other clubs. The Portuguese Continental Union, a
 
national Portuguese organization, also has a Taunton lodge.
 
A major a
spect of Portuguese community life occurs during the
 
summer when festas crowd the weekend calendar. A festa may be a simple
 
picnic without calendrical or historical significance, -or it may be a
 
festival with religious meaning. Families attend the local festas and
 
travel to ones some distance away. The major festa in Taunton is St.
 
6
 
Anthony's, sponsored by the l
ocal St. Anthony parish. The festa
 
consists of a church mass, followed by a religious procession through
 
the surrounding streets of the Portuguese village. Afterwards there i
s
 
a secular segment, during which ethnic and American foods are sold and
 
carnival events take place. Our Lady of Lourdes holds a festa in June
 
and  the Holy Ghost Club has one in July. The Taunton Sports Club holds
 
i
ts festa in July too.
 
The major secular celebration of the year occurred during the
 
course of the fieldwork--the Day of Portugal, which honors Portuguese
 
culture while commemorating the great Portuguese poet Luis De Camoes.
 
The actual holiday occurs on June 10, but the occasion is marked by
 
week-long festivities. In 1
982 the festivities began on Saturday, June
 
5 with a flag-raising ceremony on Taunton Green in the city center,
 
followed by a show by local Portuguese artists. A festa was held in
 
the Portuguese Village on Sunday. The Rancho Folciorico do Taunton
 
Sports and four other invited folklore groups from southeastern
 
Massachusetts and Rhode Island performed. Three soccer games took
 
place on Wednesday evening at the Taunton Sports field, during which
 
the club's three teams participated. Finally, on Thursday, June 1
0 a
 
dinner and fado performance was held at the PACC. The school children
 
commemorated the occasion with an end-of-the-year project of essays and
 
drawings.

History of the Taunton Portuguese School
 
The Portuguese school was founded in 1
980. Antonio Amaral,
 
president of the school since its inception, played an integral role in
 
its creation. Amaral says that he had thought of founding a school when
 
he was Taunton Sports Club president in the mid-1970s, but was
 
prevented by the lack of proper facilities. He finds his interest i
n a
 
Portuguese school natural, being the father of four and 'ianting his
 
children to learn his culture, language-, and background in an academic
 
way.
 
An organizational meeting was held during February or March 1
980
 
t
o discuss the feasibility of the school and assess the means of
 
operation and the number of possible students. Some twenty-five
 
parents, directors and officers of the Taunton Sports Club,  and
 
bilingual teachers attended the meeting. The teachers included Joselino
 
Guerreiro, who has continued her interest as present school secretary,
 
and Isaura Amaral, director of both the club's and the school's
 
folklore group.
 
The Escola Oficializada do Taunton Sports Club began classes on
 
November 5
,  1
980. The first year's enrollment numbered forty-two
 
students. They were divided by age into two classes, taught by Claudina
 
Nunes and Claudina Borges.
 
8
 
During the first year one class met in the main club hail and the
 
other met in a small adjacent room. The unsuitability of the situation
 
inspired the construction of a classroom addition to the club during
 
the summer of 1
981. Parents built the school. Antonio Amaral
 
reminisces,  "
every afternoon we used to go there after work,  and every
 
Saturday." School vice—president Jose' Goncalves even spent his summer
 
vacation on the construction. Some of those involved in the work put up
 
some of their own money to purchase initial supplies. The only hired
 
help was an e
lectrician. As a result of - the parents' involvement in
 
the construction,  costs were kept to $17,000. Funds were raised, and
 
will continue to be raised, through raffles, dances, and dinners. The
 
school remains in some debt. Antonio Amaral estimates that it will take
 
two years to r
epay this. Afterwards only general operating expenses,
 
such as electricity and heating, will remain. The school pays no rent.
 
7 /
 
/
 
The school addition was inaugurated officially on June 25,  1
982 7
 
during the visit of the Portuguese Secretary of En Jgration, Dr. Jose'
 
Adriano Gago Vitorino. The children's $10 per month tuition fees should
 
cover utility expenses, as well as each teacher's monthly salary of
 
$
10O. The school texts, supporting materials, such as maps of Portugal
 
for each classroom, and the academic guidance of Emilia Mendonca are
 
provided free of charge by the Portuguese government. Students are only
 
required t
o supply their own notebooks;  the school even provides
 
pencils.
 
9
 
The facilities are excellent:  three bright classrooms are
 
furnished with suitable desks, chairs, and blackboards donated by a
 
local school. A fourth room i
s used as a meeting room for the storage
 
of texts and school files. An outdoor stairwell is the main entrance t
o
 
the school, although the addition is connected internally to the main
 
c
lub building.
 
The school's organizers decided from the beginning to make the
 
Taunton school an official school or Escola Oficializada Portuguesa,
 
seeking support and recognition from the Portuguese Ministry of
 
Education. The Portuguese government offers singular aid to Portuguese
 
schools in the United States, which includes monetary support, free
 
textbooks, and guidance from a trained coordinator living in this
 
country. Emilia Mendonca i
s the current Inspectora do Ensino Elementar
 
employed by the Service of Basic and Secondary Education for Portuguese
 
Overseas. Working out of the Portuguese consulate in Providence, Rhode
 
Island, she i
s the first person to have held this position, having been
 
in the Untied States for two years. There i
s no cultural agreement
 
between the United States and Portugal which allows her to act as an
 
official i
i pector. She merely acts as a coordinator for the various
 
official Portuguese schools throughout the United States, including
 
schools in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and California.
 
She visits the Taunton school about once a month, meeting with teachers
 
and administrators.
 
Mendonca said that t
he f
irst program f
or Portuguese l
iving abroad
 
was begun in France in 1
975, and the7-mo
lg
�ent-was s
tarted in the
 
United States about 1
977. Portuguese schools in America voluntarily
 
choose t
o accept Portuguese government aid or t
o remain independent and
 
private. "
It i
s not the Portuguese government who's imposing these
 
/schools," says Mendonca. "
It's the freedom of the parents that are
 
interested in the education, t
o l
earn the Portuguese culture and
 
language, that makes the Portuguese government aware that they should
 
be interested and help these schools to-go ahead in the right way. I
t's
 
an answer t
o a call,  t
o the need. " The Taunton school has used these
 
s
ervices s
ince its inception.  As Antonio Amaral notes, "Anything t
hat
 
we need for our school they [
the Portuguese Ministry o
f Education] will
 
give t
o u
s, w
ithin reason."
 
'
A
 
'F
 
Emilia Mendonca i
s a t
rained elementary-school t
eacher and
 
administrator. She taught in elementary s
c
_�aoo_7s f
-
i-
-
f
or ten years, and then worked a
s an
 
Portugal, after taking an advanced course t
o become an inspector.  She
 
makes periodic reports t
o the Ministry of Education in Lisbon
 
throughout the year, and visits Lisbon once a year t
o make a direct
 
in-service r
eport.
 
Mendonca visits the Taunton school on Wednesday, a
ttending c
lasses
 
and meeting with teachers for two hours after class t
o introduce
 
supplementary material t
o the t
eachers. The texts sent -to official
 
schools from Portugal are the same texts used in homeland schools.
 
Apparently no Portuguese t
eaching materials are published in
 
1
1
 
the United S
tates. The materials Mendonca presents bridge the gap
 
/ between the old country texts and the American setting. Mendonca writes
 
the supplementary materials herself to explain to the teachers how t
o
 
teach the youngsters,  since Portuguese i
s their second language,
 
actually,-and they have t
o be more precise and direct than if it were
 
their first language. The method used,  called "direct teaching,"
 
relates lessons to daily, realistic situations. For example, during the
 
April meeting Mendonca presented a lesson plan consisting of a map of a
 
Portuguese city, showing places, such as the post office and museum, to
 
aid students on visits t
o the old country. Previously she had given a
 
lesson in which students described their homes in America,  comparing
 
them to houses in the homeland, based on knowledge obtained from their
 
parents. Mendonca commented that such lessons combine the teaching of
 
Portuguese language, history, and culture.
 
An official school must fulfill certain requirements in return for
 
Portuguese government support. Seventy—five percent of the school's
 
teachers must be educated in the Portuguese system. Apparently, it has
 
been difficult to find such teachers. The most recent teacher hired i
s
 
not a locaf man, and has to drive a considerable distance to class. To
 
gain the approval of the Ministry of Education, the school has to
 
forward teachers'  credentials and resumes to Portugal via the
 
Portuguese consul in New Bedford. Two of the present teachers are
 
certified and experienced in Portuguese elementary school teaching. The
 
third has attended a teacher—training school and has taught in Angola,
 
but is not certified. The school is also required to submit periodic
 
1
2
 
reports to the Ministry of Education in Lisbon on such things as
 
student enrollment. The local Portuguese consul makes occasional visits
 
to the school in an official capacity.
 
Not only does  the school receive the benefits outlined above from
 
operating as an official school, but its students may also take an
 
official examination whose successful passage would allow them t
o enter
 
high school in Portugal. No s
tudent has qualified to t
ake this
 
examination a
s yet, but some may do so -in the spring of 1
983.
 
Administrators,  teachers, and parents consistently praised
 
Portugal for the support it has given the school. Faced with the task
 
of opening a new school, the founders were happy to accept the
 
supervision and guidance provided by the homeland, as well as the
 
financial support (this year's grant amounted to just under $1,500) and
 
textbooks. One parent noted that he was "touched" to see "the poor
 
Pytuguese government" wanting to "help us  kee p our  cu lt ure  an d pass
 
,, /our culture t
o the next ones
 and
, wondered "how can they have the
 
courage to do it? " Another parent contrasted the excellent facilities
 
of the
. Tau Eon school with the crowded classrooms of his boyhood school
 
on Fayal, where sixty to seventy students of all ages were taught in
 
C
\
 
one room by one teacher, werrder±ng hoiW the Portuguese government could
 
manage to support schools in the United States. The teachers especially
 
r
 
are grateful for the help provided by t
Ministry of Education
 
coordinator 
A
F ri
do Morais, teacher and principal, commented on
 
his relationship with Mendonca,  We are in constant touch with each
 
)
 
other; that's why I say it's very useful." If he discovers, for
 
14
 
articulated by Antonio Amaral:  "The ideal is to have a school run by
 
the parents." Amaral is president of the school. He i
s assisted by Jose " 
Goncalves,  vice-president. The school treasurer is Joseph Fresta, a
 
leader in the local Portuguese community who, in his retirement years,
 
i
s able to devote considerable time to the school. The only non-local
 
administrator i
s the secretary, Joselina Guerreiro, a bilingual
 
teacher. All of te
-s
 
- officers have-been involved--with the

The administration also includes five elected school directors,
 
many of whom are parents. The entire administration meets about once
 
every three months, although pressing needs are addressed without a
 
meeting. The administration is responsible for everything,  including
 
the collection of the $
10 tuition fee from each student.
 
Officers are often in attendance on school nights. Gon alves i
s

Parents
 
Parents of school children have been most supportive of the
 
school. Antonio Amaral sees their interest as essential to the future
 
of the school. "It's to make sure the school goes ahead. Nobody else,
 
more than the parents, will b
e interested in the kids'  education.
 
Right? We are there now; one of the reasons I
'm there now is cause my
 
kids are there now .
 .
 .
 .
 Some day .
 .
 .
 it will be the other parents'
 
turn."
 
There i
s no formal, PTA-like organization at present, although
 
there are plans to have one in the future. Parents frequently stop t
o
 
talk with teachers after class. The teachers say that they enjoy
 
speaking with them. As Principal Morais, who also teaches, said,
 
"That's how I get my information. That's how I learn a great deal."
 
The parents receive periodic information on their children's
 
progress through report cards. This close contact is maintained
 
because, as Morais says, "
1 inform the parents of everything that goes
 
on. Everyttt mg! I don't want any surprises." Antonio Amaral observed
 
that, since Portuguese is spoken in the students' homes, parents are
 
aware of the children's progress.  "I believe it's easy to keep an idea
 
All the parents speak Portuguese, and I believe they can
 
recognize the progress of the young kids."
 
1
6
 
Transportation,  tuition expenses, and home supervision are the
 
parents' princip]
 obligations towards the school. Such obligations can
 
occupy significant time. The reasons some parents do not choose t
o send
 
their children to school include a lack of tuition money or time to
 
transport their children t
o and from school. The administration has
 
considered running a bus service to assist transportation.
 
Another explanation for lack of participation on some parents'
 
/ part waBN that recent immigrants
 concerned only with the adjustment
 
to American l
ife and the learning of English. A general apathy t
owards
 
education was cited. Another frequent comment was that student
 
attendance reflected regional differences. Immigrants from mainland
 
Portugal are more interested in culture and education. The majority
 
of the students' parents were be
born on the continent, whereas t
he
 
majority of Portuguese in the community are from the Azores.
 
All parents interviewed were born in Portugal or a Portuguese
 
territory. Asked why they sent their children to Portuguese school,
 
most parents responded that they wanted them to learn the Portuguese
 
language and t
o study Portuguese culture and history. One father saw i
t
 
as an obligation to send his children, saying,  "As a father I should
 
send my children to the school." Another father remembered his first
 
years in America during the late 1950s, when he could not find someone
 
easily who could speak both Portuguese and English; he hoped his
 
children, as bilingual speakers, might be able to help new immigrants.
 
He also viewed his children's bilingualism a
s assisting them in finding
 
better jobs.
 
Another common impetus was so that chtT T tr-could communicate with
 
N 
non-English-speaking relatives, both in the Uiited States and in the
 
homeland. The occasions for speaking Portuguese in America most often
 
mentioned were at the dinner table, in the presence of grandparent 
s
\5
 
or at celebratory Portuguese events, such as weddings and festas. Many
 
students have visited Portugal or are intending to visit
 w L-
One
 
father spoke of his desire to take his children and wife to look at the
 
house on Fayal in which he was born 2
-
o
r
-his twenty-fifth wedding
 
anniversary. He felt his children's s-h o-1 increased the likelihood of
 
a memorable trip.
 
Classes and Curriculum
 
The school operates Monday and Wednesday evenings from 5
:00 P.M. to
 
7
:00 P.M. During the 1981-82 school year there were sixty-two students
 
enrolled in the school. The students come primarily from Taunton,
 
although a few come from neighboring Raynham. A couple of students
 
began classes in the middle of the year, and a few dropped out; but the
 
basic enrollment has remained constant.
 
There are three classes--beginning for students from seven to
 
c
k\
 
eleven years old, intermediate for the eight to twelve ycaI
z oh±', and
 
advanced for the thirteen- to
 
respectively by Claudina Nunes, Josex Malhinha , and Fernando Morais. The
 
students are divided by age, rather than simply by language ability.
 
18
 
During t
he course of the fieldwork I attended a session of each
 
class. Classes emphasized Portuguese language training, with the chosen
 
texts being analysed word by word. There were also written exercises,
 
including spelling and dictation. Conversation was encouraged a
s well.
 
The exact lesson content and teaching methods were determined by the
 
level of the students and the judgment of the teacher.
 
The beginning class was devoted to -
 language study--reading aloud,
 
writing texts, spelling words, and conversation. Nunes noted that her
 
greatest problem was to teach her students to speak Portuguese well.
 
As a result, she tried t
o draw students into conversation whenever
 
ossible, either during the s
tudy of the text or through a discussion
 
about the children's families in Portug
.
 
The intermediate class was based directly on the day's text, with
 
students reading the text, taking dictation, and working on spelling.
 
Comprehension and gram mar were emphasized; students also conjugated
 
various verbs and nouns used in the basic text.
 
In the advanced class the lesson, based on the day's text, aimed
 
at comprehension of the subject matter, grammatical understanding,
 
and proper spelling. Morais tried to draw his students into Portuguese
 
conversation throughout the class because he feels student skills in
 
this area are most in need of attention.
 
My observation, corroborated by interviews with t
eachers, r
evealed
 
t
he major emphasis of the school t
o be Portuguese language training.
 
-
Because most s
tudents lacked Portuguese f
luency, the class level in
 
t
o Portugal.
 
-
 
 
" says Claudina Nunes. "
Something we got in America,
 
we-got in Portugal. You know, they are just kids, but I choose the
 
/ e
asier 
-
 
Again in the inter-mediate class actual language learning was
 
emphasized and other subjects entered the lesson obliquely.  For
 
example, Malhinha explained some basic science concerning the sun as
 
part of te9t comprehension. He also made a comparison to the home a
 
while discussing the text, noting that one .
 could not see the sea in
 
Taunton, but that in the Azores "all the time we see the sea around
 
us." He explained that subjects such as mathematics were left for
 
American schools,  and Portuguese history was done in the advanced
 
class;  in this classroom history was mentioned only to- elucidate a
 
20
 
particular t
ext, because t
eaching Portuguese history i
s diff2cult.  '
We
 
have a big problem with Portuguese history,  '
cause it's more than eight
 
hundred years."
 
Fernando Morais,  teacher of the advanced class and school
 
principal, elaborated on the subjects taught in the Portuguese school.
 
He emphasized that the basic subject was language itself.
 Each class
 
includes reading,  spelling, conversation, and social s
tudies, which he
 
defines as "
The way the people live in-Portugal;.  .
 .  where the
 
population i
s .
 .
 .
 ,the Portuguese climate, the main products grown,
 
the main source of Portuguese income." Only the auvanced class studies
 
Portuguese history as a separate subject.
 
As previously noted, the texts are proviied free of charge by the
 
Portuguese Ministry of Education, except for a few purchased in a New
 
Bedford Portuguese bookstore when the school began. Many bear
 
a Taunton Sports stamp —ESCOLA OFICLAL DO ENSINO PRIMARIO DO TAUNTON
 
SPORTS CLUB, INC.! BAKER ROAD/TAUNTON, MASSACHUSETTS 02780--and the
 
Portuguese Ministry of Education stamp--OFERTA/INSTITUTO DE CULTURA E
 
LINGUA P0RTUGUESA/ ERVIC0S DE ENSINO BASICO E SECUNDARIO PRDTUGUES NO
 
ESTRANGEIR . The paperback texts are colorful, recent publications from
 
the late 1
970s and later. All of the texts are used in schools in
 
Portugal as well.
 
Until just before my fieldwork began there had not been sufficient
 
texts for each class. Trying to treat each school equally,  the
 
Portuguese consulate forwarded only three to five copies of a text,
 
21
 
f
orcing the t
eacher to use several texts in one class, or to make
 
offset copies for each student. The teachers are encouraged that there
 
are now finally enough copies of texts for each class. The Ministry o
f
 
Education also has provided a map of Portugal, dictionaries,  and
 
l
iterary works for each classroom.
 
Those interviewed emphasized that all t
eachers are free to choose
 
,
the text and specific lesson they wish. Sometimes teachers proceed
 
/
 
V
 sequentially through a particular book;
 
aq other times they may skip
 
from text t
o text.
 
Fernando Morals noted t
hat he chose suitable lessons which would
 
be understandable to his students. For cases in which aspects of the
 
lesson were foreign to his students, he acted as a bridge between the
 
Portuguese setting of the book and the American setting of the
 
students. Morais gave the example of encountering texts which ment
 
birds native to Portugal but not to the United States, which he
 
described before proceeding with the text.
 
Just a
s the teacher acts as a bridge between text and student, the
 
Portuguese Ministry of Education coordinator, Emilia Mendonca, also i
s
 
faced with the job of adapting curriculum
, to the American setting. At
 
the monthly meeting with teachers she presents materials she has
 
written for Portuguese schools in the United States. During the April
 
meeting which I observed she explained several sets of duplicated pages
 
22
 
t
o the teachers,  including a map lesson t
o familiarize Students
 
with a typical Portuguese environment and an exercise which allowed
 
them t
o purchase a stamp or bus ticket.
 
Teachers are actively involved in the process of selecting
 
'
appropriate books. Fernando Morals showed me one book, Imagens de
  
Portugal, which had impressed him as particularly valuable — In other
 
words, by reading this book the person is going back home,  like on a
 
trip." There are only a couple of copies of this book available; as a
 
consequence, he has been able t
o use it only in a limited way. He i
s
 
ordering copies for each of his students for next year, as well a
s for
 
interested parents. The book describes each part of Portugal,
 
presenting traditional recipes and songs.
 
Several of the books sent by the Portuguese Ministry of Education
 
are not actual texts, but are books on subjects such as the selected
 
texts of the famous poet Luis De Camo 's. In the future the books sent
 
from Portugal may serve as the basis of a Portuguese l
ibrary for
 
students, parents,  and interested members of the community.
 
The three teachers s
tressed the difficuity of teaching only four
 
hours a week at a time of day when the children are tired. The students
 
come to Portuguese school having already spent a full day in American
 
schools, attending the school at their customary dinner hour. Nunes and
 
Morals both said they worked to gain students' attention through games.
 
Claudina Nunes, for example, divides her class into two teams which
 
compete in a dictation exercise at the blackboard. The children
 
23
 
Obviously loved the exercise and cheered when she announced it.  Nunes
 
also places examples of the best student work on the classroom walls.
 
"They get so excited, and thi s way  I thi nk 1 can  take
 their
 attention
 
t
o what I am doing," she says of her methods.
 
Morais ran a week-to-week spelling contest for his advanced
 
students, with each student competing for individual points -The four
 
winners received a copy of one of the general books sent from Portugal.
 
Judging from the intense discussion by-students concerning the contest
 
/
 rules, it was clear that Morais gai
- ed their attention.
 
A constant theme expressed by both parents and teachers was the
 
intention that Portuguese school work should not interfere with
 
students' American school work. The Portuguese school teachers
 
never gave any homework assignments to their students until recently.
 
They are now experimenting with limited amounts of homework. For
 
example, Morais asked for four-sentence essays, and was pleased wi
 
the results. "Usually I ask them to do things which get them together
 
with their parents on finding out things about the old country--old
 
stories, traditions," he explains.  "That way, father and son, father
 
i
-f
 
and daughter get together and talk about old.  . .
/ the things in their
 
motherland. The kids can learn an awful lot by doing that."
 
Certain special projects are carried on throughout the school
 
year. The advanced class made drawings depicting Portuguese emigration
 
around the world which were sent to the Ministry of Education in Lisbon
 
24
 
to compete with those of Portuguese school students outside the
 
homeland. Other projects of limited length included the one undertaken
 
by the beginning class of preparing its own newspaper 0 Nosso Jornal.
 
The major project of the school year was in honor of the Day of
 
Portugal on June 10. This year's theme, announced in Lisbon, was "The
 
Day of Portugal and Portuguese Communities." trincipal Fernando Morais
 
selected as the school's essay theme "Please explain in your own words
 
in what way have the Portuguese contributed to  the development in our
 
community." Students also made drawings on the theme. The essays and
 
drawings were displayed in the school's hallway for viewing by parents
 
and friends during the Day of Portugal soccer games held at the club
 
on June 9 and after graduation on June 25.
 
The drawings depicted Portuguese-owned neighborhood markets,
 
garages, and furniture stores; the Portuguese school itself; various
 
Portuguese occupations in the area, such as fishing, farming, and
 
factory work; and Portuguese homes with grapevines in the yard. The
 
e
ssays described how the hard-working Portuguese are employed in local
 
factories or operate their own businesses. They described elements of
 
the ethnic community communications system, such as Portuguese
 
newspapers, radio stations, and television programs, soccer, and
 
festas
The pervasive influence of Portuguese food on the surrounding
 
population was also a constant theme. The Portuguese consul was so
 
impressed by the work that he awarded special certificates f

Steve Almeida, an eighth-grader in the advanced class,  described
 
the Portuguese community in a prize—winning essay translated for me by
 
Fernando Morais:
 
C
 
The dream of the Portuguese when he goes to a different
 
country is to improve and better hi.  way of life. When
 
he arrives, he works hard, saves his money, and makes
 
lots of sacrifices in order to make his dreams come
 
true. The Portuguese immigrant is a hard worker. He
 
likes to pay his debts, because he is honest and proud.
 
He wants to have nice and beautif .
i
i.  things and he keeps
 
his name clean. Lots of Portuguese buy old houses. They
 
make improvements and they become just like new. Other
 
Portuguese have their own businesses, for instance,
 
Antonio Amaral, Mr. Caramelo, and Jose Fernandes, and
 
many others. Others go to school and study. Later they
 
become lawyers, doctors, teachers, and priests. One of
 
the most important figures is Carainal Humberto
 
Medeiros. Others work in markets, factories, and
 
offices. The streets where the Portuguese live keep
 
looking much better. The houses hdve been improved.
 
There are beautiful gardens, beautiful statues of
 
saints near the beautiful houses. The Portuguese like
 
t
o maintain their traditions;  that's why we have our
 
festas, mostly religious, at St. .
Antonio ,Zhurch and
 
Nossa Senhora de Lourdes, at the PtCC, Thunton Sports,
 
and our school, and the Day of Portugal.
 
Student Language Capabilities
 
Students come to the Portuguese school with a previous knowledge
 
of Portuguese. The majority of students have parents born in Portugal
 
and many were born in Portugal themselves. The typical home situation
 
finds students hearing their parents and grandparents speak Portuguese
 
while they reply in English. Antonio Amaral talked about such a
 
situation in his family.  "We always speak Portuguese. The kids answer
 
26
 
in English. We are so involved that we sometimes don't recognize that
 
they're speaking English back to us. The two languages work
 
simultaneously. We don't try to correct them, that's why they
 
/
 
7" understand; but they're kind of lazy speaking it,  'cause they're afraid
 
it's not coming out."

The primary aim of the Portuguese school appears t
o be to provide
 
the students with an increased fluency in Portuguese. "In this school
 
that's what we're doing--we're pursuing- the improvement in the
 
Portuguese language," says principal Morais.
 
We want them to learn and improve. But, of course, we
 
know the Portuguese language is going to be their
 
second language. We want to maintain our culture, and
 
our customs, and everything, but we have to realize
 
that English is the first language and Portuguese will
 
be their second language. But, of course, when they
 
meet Portuguese people, they socialize in Portuguese
 
functions and they are going to use .
 .
 .  the
 
Portuguese language. It won't be lost there. They know
 
how t
o communicate and they know how to deal with those
 
thingsi
 
The students' prime fluency in English intrudes upon the classroom
 
situation and general school environment. One night, while setting up a
 
tape recorder before class, I overheard some girls having an English
 
conversation in the classroom. A boy entered the room, took a look at
 
me, and told the girls, "This is a Portuguese school, not English!" One
 
girl replied that class had not begun and continued t
o speak English.
 
27
 
Students always spoke English with one another before and after
 
class. During class students continued t
o address each other in
 
English. Claudina Nunes, like the other teachers, found it impossible
 
t
o limit classes to Portuguese language usage.  "We can never get
 
this from the kids," she says,  "
because they already have the idea to
 
speak in English, even if they are joking or anything. They just try t
o
 
speak English .
 .
 . ,
 they just speak English. All the t
ime I say,  '
No
 
English, just Portuguese!' But forget it!"
 
English fluency creates certain difficulties in learning
 
Portuguese. Advanced students, for example, already have a good
 
knowledge of English grammar, which may confuse them at times. Morals
 
laughed as he told how he would explain certain grammatical rules and
 
students would tell him, "No, you are wrong!" based on their
 
understanding of English grammar.
 
In his short time at the school the intermediate teacher Jose'
 
Malhinha has seen progress in the reading and writing abilities of his
 
students. Morais, the teacher of the advanced class, gauges the
 
improvement of his students by the fact that he no longer has to remind
 
them continually not to speak English. "At first they were shy [
to
 
speak Portuguese]. Now every day they are more and more comfortable."
 
28
 
Students
 
The students have mixed attitudes towards attending Portuguese
 
school. They frequently explained that they go to Portuguese school
 
because their parents want them to go; yet there others who were
 
excited about Portuguese school and said they would attend without
 
parental urging. Most teachers and administrators, though, would agree
 
with Fernando Morals's assessment:  "I believe a good part of them are
 
there because their parents want them to be.'
 
Since the Portuguese l
ive throughout the city, students may come
 
t
o school without knowing other students. The children are able to meet
 
new friends at the school and develop their friendship network w
.i
- t
h---
Portuguese affiliation.  I guess in this school everybody has something
 
in common with you 'cause you're Portuguese and the same thing at home.
 
Whereas in [
high]  school your culture is different from everyone
 
else's, and you might not have as many things in common," explains
 
Teresa Amaral, a student in the advanced class. Students ar
,
 
enthusiastic about the new friends they have made through
 
school, and talked of telephoning their friends or even visiting them
 
a
t home. Other students said they had the same friends in both
 
Portuguese and American school.
 
Speaking of what they have learned a
t Portuguese school, students
 
emphasized language skills, mentioning improvements in writing
 
(
especially spelling) and speaking. Steve Almeida felt he had improved
 
in his Portuguese reading and writing skills, but thought his greatest
 
29
 
progress was in his speaking skills. Teresa Amaral was enthusiastic
 
about her improved Portuguese skills, especially her ability to write
 
letters to a girl she had met on a recent trip to Portugal. Parents
 
also told of seeing children reading Portuguese newspapers in the home,
 
or of noticing their improved comprehension of the language at
 
functions such as plays performed in Portuguese.
 
Teachers
 
/
 Without exception teachers indlcat€d that they taught in the
 
Portuguese school out of love for teaching and love for their culture
 
The teachers' $
100 a
- month(
j ry certainly does not compensate
 
them for their efforts of teaching classes, attending teachers'
 
meetings and school functions, and prEparing and grading lessons at
 
home. All of them hold full-time jobs outside of Taunton and have t
o
 
rush to arrive at school on time.
 
Fernando Morals expressed the wish that he could teach full time,
 
rather than work as a manager at Christy's Market. "I'll be planning t
o
 
teach for as long as I can. I love this!" Claudina Nunes, who provides
 
a warm, maternal guidance for her young students, comes to the school
 
tired from a day's work as a machine operator. After class she resumes
 
her home duties by cooking supper. The vitality she exhibits in class
 
fades when she leaves the school.  "Over here I
'm just excited,  1 don't
 
feel nothing. But when I ge t ou t of here,
 oh  my  God!  
A1
 
Jose Maihinha was
 
30
 
happy to accept the position recently offered him by Principal Morais,
 
his former classmate.  "I never talk about the money, because I know
 
they don't pay too much.  .
 .
 .
 I like to teach again my own language.'
 
The teachers posses . the background of teacher's training and
 
t
eaching experience in the Portuguese elementary school system required
 
by the Portuguese Ministry of Education. All three teachers emigrated
 
t
o the United States as adults, accompanied by their immediate
 
families. While they have had experien e in the Portuguese system, none
 
were familiar with the textbooks now used in the Portuguese school in
 
Taunton. Malhinha explained that there was only one official book for
 
each class before the 1
976 revolution in Portugal; but numerous books
 
have been written since.
 
Despite some adaptation, the curriculum of the official
 
Portuguese school in Taunton i
s rooted firmly in the Portuguese system.
 
Jose Malhinha made some interesting comparisons between the two
 
systems, however. Throughout the class I observed he made comments
 
contrasting procedures in Portuguese school with those in American
 
schools. He observed that Portuguese students write in script on
 
standard-size paper, while American students print on all types of
 
paper. He was also surprised that his present students chew gum in
 
class; in homeland schools there is strict discipline. There is,
 
nevertheless,  '
considerable discipline in the Taunton Portuguese
 
school, reinforced by parental cooperation. One mother was overheard
 
telling a teacher to pull her son's ears i
f he did not behave, and a
 
31
 
young boy commented that the main difference between Portuguese and
 
American schools was that the Portuguese school teachers are more
 
strict.
 
The t
eachers meet monthly after a Wednesday class. Emilia Mendonca
 
usually attends these meeting to introduce supplementary materials.
 
Principal Morais leads these sessions in her absence. There is no
 
interaction with teachers from  cher Portuguese schools in the area.
 
Considering the American setting, the requirements for teachers
 
are somewhat demanding —copies of teachers'  certificates of graduation
 
and resumes must be forwarded to the Ministry of Education in Lisbon by
 
the New Bedford Portuguese consul for approval. This process takes
 
several months and, therefore, the school began without approval.  All
 
teachers have been approved to date and the school has not had to give
 
/
 
/
 , -
 
7 up  its official status. Principal Morais feels that finding additional
 
teachers will not be a problem. When one second year teacher was forced
 
to quit suddenly at the end of the year, he located his former
 
classmate Malhinha, whom he knew was qualified.
 
32
 
Purposes of the School
 
The primary reason given for the existence of the school is
 
language instruction. The teachers are very conscious of the importance
 
of language study.  "They should learn Portuguese too. I think it's very
 
important that they learn Portuguese like they learn English," says
 
beginning class teacher Claudina Nunes.
 
First thing is, this way they can communicate with the
 
family. Because, l
ike you see, we got a lot of kids,
 
,they have grandparents here, and it's sad they cannot
 
deal with grandparents  '
cause they don't know, you
 
know, they don't speak English.  .
 .  .  We think  h nk-
it's sad. And they go, you know, so often to Portugal
 
to visit with the family over there, and [when]  they
 
go, they don't speak nothing Portuguese. They don't
 
understand what the family .
 .
 .  means or they talk
 
about. We think this way--the English is  .
 .  .  the
 
first language for everybody, but to learn the second
 
language, their language, is going to be better, for
 
the good.
 
Malhinha torse s the day when the students, competent in both
 
English and Portuguese, will graduate from colleges and technical
 
schools and will be an asset to the Portuguese community, assisting
 
other community members who are not fluent in English. Fernando Morais
 
feels language preservation is a means of preserving culture.  "More or
 
less, it starts with the parents," he says. "The parents come to us,
 
and they say 'We want our son or daughter to learn the language and the
 
history.' Some of these kids were born there [
Portugal]. Some were born
 
here. But there is this concern on the part of the parents for the
 
children to learn the language,  the correct way to speak fluently,
 
33
 
because we want to preserve our culture and we want them to pass our
 
culture to future generations a
s well." Elaborating from his own
 
experience, he adds:
 
If the kids are t
ired, the teachers are tired t
oo
 
[
laughs]!
 e have a whole day's work in our own jobs
 
too. What happens i
s the children only see the present
 
now. But later in life they will say "
I should have
 
learned Portuguese, why didn't I learn Portuguese!?"
 
This i
s an example I see everyday. I see people from
 
Portuguese descent, and they were born in this country,
 
and they say "Why didn't I listen t
o my grandmother,
 
grandfatter  I could have learn-6d the language with
 
them."
 
Parents view the purpose of the school in both practical and
 
cultural terms. C ndido Almeida, parent of two school children and a
 
school director himself, spoke of the general enriching experience of
 
learning several languages. Almeida also sees his children's learning
 
"
the language of their ancestors" as a basic part of the preservation
 
of their ethnic heritage. He described the preservation of culture a
s
 
being like constructing a building--you have to start with a foundation
 
or the building will be destroyed--and language i
s the foundation of
 
culture.
 
Antonio Amaral, school president and father of three students,
 
sees his children's language training in practical and ethnic- eri age
 
terms.  "I like for them to learn the language, first of all,  bec:aus
 
it's a plus in whatever they become in the future, Secondly, it's t
o
 
preserve our customs and ways, and that means a lot because, not that
 
we're different, but every ethnic group is different. And we like to
 
have things that we'd like t
o preserve in our culture." Later he
 
elaborated on the school's function.  "I think the school helps by
 
34
 
t
eaching our youngsters our e
ssential things, you know. Also, by
 
getting them together with one another, they lose that shyness that
 
they would have if they were not together. In American school,  I
 
believe, many of them avoid to say '
I'm Portuguese,'  or even to say a
 
word in Portuguese. But by being together with so many that speak the
 
same language or think the same way,  they might not be ashamed, and
 
they might be aware of the fact they're also important."
 
Amaral also sees the Portuguese school a
s serving the local
 
s
ociety and c
ountry at large:
 
But, nevertheless, we're doing a service to this
 
country. In a way we're preparing better citizens for
 
the future, because I
'm sure they [
the students] are
 
going t
o stay here for the rest of their lives. And
 
giving them extra knowledge of another foreign
 
language, makes it easier for them to learn French or
 
Spanish in the future, if they want to take those
 
courses in the high school.  It will prepare them better
 
for high school also, because they already have
 
experience with a foreign language. And it keeps them,
 
,bove all, out of the streets
 in their free  time,
 which
 
7
 i
s a problem
ecause most of the kids today don't have
 
anything els -to do after school. If they are out in
 
the street,  they get into problems. After all, it's
 
social service.
 
Reiterating his belief that an ethnic language and heritage
 
school, such as the Taunton Portuguese school, serves the good of
 
the country, Amaral addressed a final interview comment to the American
 
government:
 
I
'd l
ike to know how the American government sees this
 
project in the p.private schools.  .
 .
 .  They do
 
encourage or they
 Is that a pro or against the
 
principles? I thin
T
hat's a fair question. To me, I
 
think i
t's a pro, because this country is not any
 
longer a melting pot. We all have something different
 
to offer, and the more we offer, the better the country
 
35
 
will b
e.  t
ight? We cannot say just the Irish are the
 
good ones,  or the English,  the South Americans, or the
 
colored pecple. They all have something good and
 
something cad.
 .
 *
 
Twenty-two years Jo, when I aame,  there was  he
 
tendency that we all have to be American regardless.
 
all have ti  melt into it, you know, it was the idea,
 
that ideal. Then i
t changed with the bilingual program
 
and the trying to accept everyone's ideas and cultures,
 
which i
s good. It's good! That's what made this nation
 
so bi g , so great-- right?--was  every
body  working
 to  the  
same goals —a better life for everybody. That's my
 
comments.
 
The role of the Portuguese school in maintaining the Portuguese
 
ethnic heritage must be judged against the background of the local
 
community. The grad'iation ceremony on June 25 underscored the
 
Portuguese sense of community. The highlight of the occasion was the
 
official visit by Dr. Jose' Adriano Gago Vitorino, the Portuguese
 
Secretary of State for Emigration, whose department supplies the funds
 
to support official Portuguese schools in the United States. He
 
inaugurated the school addition and gave the key graduation address.
 
The graduation ceremony rang with culturally important phrases, such as
 
"
Portuguese community," "
our culture," "our language," and "the
 
Portuguese family." Students delivered dramatic interpretations of
 
Portuguese -
poetry, and the honored speakers —Dr. Vitorino,  the New
 
Bedford Portuguese consul, the president of the Taunton Sports Club, a
 
local Portuguese priest, and the school president —praised the
 
community for its work in maintaining the Portuguese heritage through
 
their school.
 
36
 
Future of the Escola Oficializada Portuguesa
 
do Taunton Sports Club
 
The school anticipates continued growth. After the graduation
 
ceremonies school president Amaral said that next year he hopes t
o have
 
,an additional Tuesday and Thursday session. He also noted that, based
 
on the size of Taunton's Portuguese community, a 200 student enrollment
 
c
ould be expected in the future. Some advertisements of the school will
 
b
e placed in Portuguese newspapers and churches in the area to attract
 
s
tudents, but no concerted campaign will be launched. Amaral prefers t
o
 
have students come to the school voluntarily.  "It's available to those
 
who want it."
 
Amaral would like to have tape recorders and slide projectors
 
available at the school to take advantage of additional materials
 
offered by the Ministry of Education. He a
lso hopes t
o devel
 
extracurricular activities in addition to the soccer team and toL<isr-
group for the students.  "It's a million things we can offer if we have
 
the money and facilities."
 
Fieldwork Techniques
 
The informants in this project were most cooperative. I feel that
 
being a native of the area helped to provide credibility for me. I came
 
to this project unfamiliar with Portuguese culture, which I remedied
 
/
 
through research, and with the Portuguese language, although I did have
 
my college French.  Since all of my informants spoke some English, I was
 
37
 
able to feel comfortable in the field situation and do not feel that my
 
lack of Portuguese was detrimental to the project. Comparing this work
 
t
o my previous experience of working in a language other than English
 
in which I was fluent, I believe that my unfamiliarity with the
 
Portuguese language and culture was advantageous to the pr
 
allowed me t
o distinguish Portuguese ethnic characteristic
 
perspective o
f an outsider.
 
Acknowledgements
 
I would l
ike to thank the administrators, teachers, parents,
 
students, and friends of the Escola Oficializada Portuguesa do Taunton
 
Sports Club for their generous cooperation. This project could not have
 
been accomplished without their kind assistance and continuous aid. I
 
would like t
o offer special thanks to those who provided translation
 
services. I finish t
rus project profoundly impressed with the
 
commitment and energy shown by those involved with the school. It was
 
with great personal pleasure that I came to know and respect the
 
members of the Taunton Portuguese community and to appreciate their
 
efforts in the maintenance of the Portuguese language and ethnic
 
heritage in the United States.
