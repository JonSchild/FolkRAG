Dear Readers:
 
From time immemorial the sharing of a meal has been a happy
 
manifestation of friendship and congeniality.
 Ghanaians have
 
always been noted for their zest for food and the friendliness and
 
warmth of their hospitality.
 
It gives me great pleasure to have this opportunity to share
 
with you basic authentic Ghanaian recipes that I have worked on
 
over the years in order to make their cooking simple enough for
 
our non-Ghanaian friends.
 Special consideration has been given
 
to ensure that all ingredients used here are available in regular
 
supermarkets and foodstores throughout this country.
 The season-
ing and taste, as mentioned in my publication The Art of West African
 
Cooking (Doubleday 1972), has been adjusted to popular American
 
taste; and all measurements are according to American standards.
 
Increased and improved means of communication among the
 
peoples of the world have, without doubt, brought about a fantastic
 
interest in foods of all countries, and I am particularly
 
impressed and happy about the constantly growing desire of our
 
American friends to develop more than a passing interest in tbci
 
foods of the Continent of Africa.
 
Happy Cooking and Happy Memories!
