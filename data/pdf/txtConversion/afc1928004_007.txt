Tim subject of the following sketch first saw the 
light of Heaven—breathed the breath of life—prat-
tled the language of the Anglo-Saxon in the Sixth 
Ward, New York— the Bloody Sixth—but now, thanks 
to the municipal police, eroton water, and other re-
quisite regenerators it can take its stand along with 
any of its neighboring wards in the above great, 
glorious and magnificent city—on the 2d day of Oc-
tober, 1891, Anno Domino. 
His education was 
limited, very-- nothing but a 
public school one, and 
by-the-bye. in Public School Number One—merely 
sandelass ab's, ib's, eb's, ub's, and got as far as m-u-d, 
and there he got stuck. 
Old Windsey was the 
teacher, and the cause of bringing out the " wocal". 
abilities of Pete.—lt was on " Evacuation Day " 
1828; there were but four public schools in the city 
then, three of which got holidays from their teach-
ers—but old " Windsey " was inflexible— adamant, 
and wouldn't succumb, he being " hevery hinch han 
Henglishman," and couldn't bear the thoughts of 
unsophisticated innocence enjoying itself " shoot-
ing mibs," firing crackers, tv,c. Szc., in the Park, 
celebrating the departure of the British Lions and 
Bulls from this blessed land of apple sass and pump-

kin pies--pork, beans, and wooden nutmegs, free-
dom and any quantity of patriotism—no, no, not 
he— so after going down to " Mr. Opkinses, corner 
of Hoak hand Holiver" streets, and fortifying. him-
self and his epigastrium with a 
glass of foaming 
"Halbany Hale," school commenced. 
The first 
burst of music in the Park from the " milingtary," 
was enough; war was declared, a 
leader was wanted, 
Pete was pitched upon— he accepted the office with 
all the grace and dignity a 
person of his inches 
and years was capable of. 
Windsey became terri-
fic, his son Harry came to the rescue ; this youth 
would always insist and command the little boys 
to call him " Enry, not Arry." 
Books, ink-stands, 
sand, 
rulers, 
copybooks, 
papers, 
geographies, 
atlases, grammars, flew in the most delightful pro-
fusion; a large 
American reader 
struck 
old 
" 
Windsey " betwixt wind and water, which made 
him " Vamoose the Ranch," in doing of which 
be received many a 
K. N. kick on his seat of know-
ledge—ahem ! 
the old ass. 
Pete now became imma-
culate—supreme major domo—poet Laureate, and 
composed the following 
epistle 
instanter, from 
which he dates his first start in the comic singing 
line :— 
On the vacuation Day 
The 13ntish run away, 
So please Mr. Windsey, 
To give us holiday. 
This was sung with a 
gusto and chorus that would 
Pete Morris. 
put the blush on the bellowings and countenances 
of the present day chorus singers of the much 
vaunted Academy of Music. 
Suffice it to say Pete 
got the boys a 
holiday, and he got a 
discharge from 
school—and went to work at the printing business, 
on the Journal of Commerce, after which he served 
his time with Herrick and Ropes, on the Sunday 
Atlas, and all the intellect, wisdom, knowledge', 
and other little requisites 
for the well-being of 
a 
humble person in this sublunary sphere he ob-
tained from Deacon Herrick and John F. Ropes, 
and he takes this method to return them ( in thea-
trical parlance,) " his heartfelt thanks," after many 
vicissitudes both by sea and land—remarkable es-
capes—by flood and field. 
Pete is now 37, in the 
enjoyment of excellent health, at the present writ-
ing—a 
firm friend—a 
manly and courageous enemy, 
and take him all in all, " a 
Diamond in the Rough." 
PETE MORRIS' SONGSTER. 
Revolutionary Reminiscences. 
Tusz.—The Gal from the South. 
Dedicated to our much respected progenitor, John Ball, 
Originally written and sung by the American Comic Melo-
dist, Pete Morris. 
JOHN BULL do you remember, 
Some eighty years ago, 
When we were very young, John, 
Your head was white as snow ; 
You didn't count us much sir, 
And thought to make us run, 
But found out your mistake, old boy, 
One day at Lexington. 
Then we invite you in, John, 
To take a 
cup of Tea, 
Made in Boston Harbour, John, 
The teapot of the free; 
You didn't like the party, sir, 
It wasn't quite select, 
There were some abroginees 
You didn't quite expect. 
Then another much loved spot, John, 
Such sweet associations, 
The day you marched down to York 
To see your rich relations, 
9 
lo 
Pete Morris' Songster. 
The Dutchman of the Mohawk, sir, 
Anxious to entertain, 
Put up sonic Gates that stopped you, sir, 
On Saratoga Plain. 
Oh, no, we never mention it, 
We never thought it lucky, 
The day you charged the cotton bags 
And got into Kaintucky; 
Why I 
thought you knew geography, 
For misses in their teens, 
Would have told you that Kaintucky lay, 
Why just below Orleans. 
You say we are great braggers, John, 
Ah, you know it is our wont ; 
We showed you Bragg in Mexico, 
Likewise in old Varmount, 
At Bennington you must confess 
You really felt quite sad, 
The Green Mountain boys, I 
sumo did think 
You were actually Stark mad. 
The mistress of the ocean., John, 
She couldn't rule the Lakes, 
You had some ganders in your fleet, 
But, John you had no Drakes, 
Your choicest spirits to were there 
You took your hock and sherry, 
But, John, you couldn't stand our fare 
You couldn't take our Perry. 
You had some corns upon your toes 
Cornwall .s that was one, 
And at the siege of Yorktown 
'Why then you couldn't run, 
You tried quite hard you must admit, 
And threw away your gun, 
Gave up your sword—fie, John, for shame, 
To the Immortal Washington! 
Pete Morris' Songster.

MORAL. 
Nearly eighty years have gone and past, 
And we've lived snug and coodle. 
You, forgetting what has passed before, 
Think to frighten Yankee Doodle, 
But the Yankee boys are all on hand 
And will fight for freedom ever, 
We'll give you Johnny " down the banks," 
And have liberty for ever! 
California as It Is. 
TIISE—" Jeannette and Jeannot." 
Written by Thaddeus Meighan, 
And sung to millions of persons at the American Museum, 
and elsewhere, by Pete Morris. 
I'vE been to California and I 
haven't got a 
dime, 
I've lost my health, my strength, my hope, and I 
have lost my time, 
I've only got a 
spade and pick and if I 
felt quite 
brave, 
I'd use the two of them 'ere things to scoop me 
out a 
grave, 
This digging hard for gold may be politic and 
bold, 
But you could not make me think so, but you may 
if you are told, 
Oh! I've been to California and I'm minus all the 
gold, 
For instead of riches plenty, I've only got a 
cold, 
And I 
think in going mining I 
was regularly sold. 
Pete Morris' Songster.

Pete Morris' Songster. 
I 
left this precious city with two suits of gallus 
rig, 
My boots though India-rubber, were suffici-antly 
big, 
For to keep the water out, as well as alligators, 
And I 
tell you now my other traps were very 
small potatoes; 
I 
had a 
great machine, the greatest ever seen, 
To wash the sands of value and to get the gold 
out clean, 
And I 
had a 
fancy knapsack fill'd with sausages 
and ham, 
And of California diggers I 
went out the great I 
am, 
But found the expedition was a 
most confounded 
flam. 
Now only listen to me, and I'll tell you in a 
trice, 
That poking in the dirt for gold ain't more than 
very nice; 
You're starved, stewed and frozen, and the strong-
est man he says he's 
Bound to have your money or he'll wallup you 
like blazes; 
I 
was shot, and stabbed, and kicked, and remark-
ably well licked, 
And compell'd to eat poll parrots, which were 
roasted but not picked, 
And I 
slept beneath a 
tent which hadn't got a 
top, 
With a 
ragged blanket round me and the ground 
all of a 
sop, 
And for all this horrid suffering I 
haven't got a 
cop. 
So here I 
am without a 
home, without a 
cent to 
spend, 
No toggery, no wittles, and not a 
single friend; 
With lizards, parrots, spiders, snakes, and other 
things unclean, 
All crowded in my stomach and I'm very weak 
and lean. 
But I 
ain't the only one that's got tired of this 
ere fun, 
For about a 
dozen thousand chaps are ready now 
to run, 
As hard as they can possibly, from there to king-
dom come, 
For there they ain't nobody sir, but here they 
might be some, 
And enjoy their cakes and coffee and now and 
then some rum. 
MORAL. 
If you've enough to eat and drink and buy your 
Sunday clothes, 
Don't listen to the gammon that from California 
blows, 
But stay at home and thank your stars, for every 
hard earned cent, 
And if the greenhorns go to dig why coolly " let 
'ern went," 
If you go, why you will see, the eephant, yes, sir-
ree, 
And some little grains of gold that are no bigger 
than a 
flea; 
I've just come from California and if any here 
there be 
Who is got that yellow fever, they need only look 
at me, 
And I 
think New York will suit ' em, yes, exactly 
to a 
T.

Pete Morris' Songster. 
Crinoline. 
Originally written and arranged by Pete Morris. 
OH, Crinoline! Oh, Crinoline! ! 
It is the fashion of the day, 
The Queen of France invented it, 
To keep the horrid men—the horrid men 
away; 
It's so very nice! and so cool! ! 
The ladies swear they'll never give it up, 
Kase yen a 
feller vants to kiss a 
gal, 
I 
tell you now he has some trouble to get 
I'm single yet ! I'm single yet, 
And years have flown since I 
came out; 
In vain I 
sigh—in vain I 
fret, 
Ye gods! ye gods! what, what, what, are 
the men about? 
I 
vow I'm twenty, oh, ye powers! 
A 
spinster's lot is hard to bear, 
On earth alone to pass her hours, 
And afterwards lead apes down there. 
No offer yet! no offer yet! ! 
I'm sure—I'm sure I 
cannot make it out, 
For every beau my cap I 
set, 
What, what, what, are the men about? 
They don't propose, they won't propose, 
For fear perhaps I 
would say " yes ;" 
I 
wish they'd try, for heaven knows, 
I'm tired of single, single blessedness. 
Not married yet—not married yet, 
lleighho! alack and well-a-day! 
A 
hand of snow, an eye of jet, 
Are all I 
have—are all I 
have to give 
away, 
Pete Morris' Songster. 
15 
They say she's pretty—but no chink, 
With hands extended, thus they flout, 
There's nothing green in me I 
think, 
" 
Or does your mother—does your mother 
know you're out." 
Billy I 
have missed you. 
A 
parody on" Willie I 
have missed you," dedicated to the 
Bowery Bo'hoys, with feelings of distinguished considera-
tion, by Pete Morris. 
011! Billy, I 
have missed you, 
Since I've been on this spree, 
Vy don't you come see a 
pet, 
Up in the Bowwowree ? 
The Bowery ain't " played out" yet, 
You may think that rayther queer, 
Kase the Dutchman have possession 
Wid their schnapps and Lager Bier; 
So come along, my Billy boy, 
The sports will be around, 
They'll show you all the sights, Billy, 
In this gay and gallus town. 
Oh! Billy I 
have missed you, 
And it makes my heart grieve, 
I'm bound for Blackwell's Island, 
The city I 
must lea;re, 
So come up there my Billy boy, 
You shan't be treated mean, 
We will talk about our gin-head days, 
Yen we run wid de old mashine, 
You shall have mush plenty, Billy boy, 
On Sunday you'll get rice, 
So come along my Billy dear, 
The times will be so nice.

Pete Morris' Songster. 
Things I don't like to see. 
A rem] popular comic song, 
Originally written and sung by Pete Morris, with unbounded 
approbation. 
Tuzie— " 
Iris4 washerwoman." 
A 
SONG I'll sing now in jingling rhymes, 
About matters and things in these curious 
times, 
A lesson to all I 
hope it will be, 
When I 
sing you about things I 
don't like 
to see. 
Chorus. 
You may call me a 
quiz, you may call me a 
pry, 
But I 
doesn't like things that look queer to the 
eye, 
And if you like them, that's nothing to me, 
So these are some things that I 
don't like to 
see: 
I 
don't like to see little boys just from their 
mammas, 
Who think they are men and smoke their 
segars, 
They had better be at home a-playing with toys, 
Than running the streets and exclaiming " I'm 
one of the Bo'hoys." 
Chorus. 
I 
don't like to see dandies without any cash, 
Promenade Broadway, and cut quite a 
dash, 
Who stare at the ladies— look pretty and sweet, 
Without a 
cent in their pocket and nothing to 
eat. 
Chorus. 
Pete Morris' Songster. 
I 
don't like to see gals all the time reading son-
nets, 
Romances and' novels, wear queer little bon-
nets, 
Who screw up their waists and wear a 
tight 
sleeve, 
And dare not, poor creatures, enjoy a good 
sneeze. 
Chorus. 
I 
don't like to see politicians, who take grea,t 
pains 
To show their constituents they are possessed 
of large brains, 
Who talk about this thing—and blow about that, 
And all that they're after is government—pap. 
Chorus. 
I 
don't like to see ladies .want satins for dress, 
When their husband's a 
bankrupt and in great 
distress ; 
They had better be at home, washing up dishes, 
Mending holes in their stockings, and their 
husband's old pantaloons. 
Chorus. 
I 
don't like to see John Bull, " putting on airs," 
Sending troops to the Canadas the Yankees to 
scare, 
He'd better " dry up" or he'll git in a 
fix, 
That will give him a 
specimen of " old seventy-
six." 
Chorus. 
The Strong-minded Woman. 
Originally arranged and sung by Pete Morris. 
Wny don't the men propose, mamma ? 
Why don't the men propose ? 
Each seems just coming to the point, 
And then away he goes, 
It is no fault of yours, mamma, 
That everybody knows; 
You fete the finest in the land, 
Yet, oh ! they won't propose. 
Chorus. 
They won't, they won't, 
They won't, they wont, 
They wont propose, 
Mamma, mamma, they won't, they won't pro-
I'm sure I've done the best mamma, 
To make a 
proper match; 
For coronets and eldest sons 
I'm ever on the watch: 
I've hopes when some distingue beaux 
A 
glance upon me throws; 
But though he'll dance and smile and flirt, 
Alas! he won't propose! 
I've tried to win by languishing, 
And dressing like a 
blue; 
I've bought big books and talk'd of them, 
As tho' I'd read them through. 
With hair cropp'd like a 
man, I've felt 
The heads of all the beaux; 
But Spurzheim could not touch their hearts, 
And oh! they won't propose! 
I 
threw aside the books and thought 
That ignorance was bliss; 
I 
felt convinced that men prefered 
A 
simple sort of Miss; 
And so I 
lisp'd out naught beyond 
Plain " yeses" or plain " noes," 
And wore a 
plain unmeaning smile; 
Yet oh, they won't propose! 
Last night at Lady Ramble's rout, 
I 
heard Sir Harry Gale 
Exclaim, " Now I 
propose again; 
I 
started, turning pale: 
I 
really thought my time had come, 
I 
blushed like any rose; 
But oh! I 
found ' twas only at 
Beane he'd propose! 
And what is to be done mamma! 
Oh what is to be done ? 
I 
really have no time to lose, 
For I 
am thirty-one ! 
At balls I 
am too often left 
Where spinsters sit in rows; 
Why don't the men propose, mamma?' 
Why don't the men propose? 
The Bird Song. 
Not Jenny Lind's, but Pete Morris'. 
(Original.) 
CHICKLING why sing in the barn-yard wide ? 
Say why, 
why. 
Call you the bridegroom or the bridSe
a, 
Oh, say, 
Oh, say. 
, 
20 
Pete Morris' Songster. 
I 
call no bridegroom or bride, 
And sing because ' tis in my hide, 
Nor know, 
Nor know, 
Nor know why thus I'm singing. 
Pigling and you have it very fine, 
Ah! bait 
Say why; 
My little rumsey-dumpsey swine, 
Oh, say, 
Oh say. 
How nice you'll look in gravy, 
And from the spit, salt can't save thee; 
Ah then! 
Ali then. 
Ah, won't there be a 
squealing, 
Imitation, and repeat. 
One of the Ito , hoys. 
Original by Pete Morris. 
TUNE.—" Go it while you're young." 
I 
am a 
dashing, sporting blade, 
That every body knows, 
In fact I 
am by nature made 
One of the fanciest chaps that goes. 
I 
/
visits every public place 
Where there's mirth and jollity ; 
And when the lads they see my face, 
Why they sing out for a 
spree. 
Then what is life without its joys, 
Or a 
spree without old Pete, 
I 
tell you I'm one of the gayest lads, 
" 
That's so," and can't be beat. 
Pete Morris' Songster. 
21 
On Sunday I 
sports a 
welvet west, 
My pants are gallus cut, 
And the galls they all do stare at me 
As through the streets I 
strut. 
The little boys do at me gaze, 
And say there goes gay old Pete, 
He's one of the boys that's bound to blaze, 
" 
That's so," and he can't be beat. 
I 
always felt inclined to go 
Amongst the boys aroun', 
And sometimes got genteelly blue, 
But never tumbled down. 
The boys would say don't drink no more, 
See how the folks do gaze; 
Oh ! let them look till their eyes are sore, 
I 
tell you I'm bound to blaze. 
The other night I took my tea 
At Sweeney's, in Chatham street, 
I 
called to one of the laddies there 
To fetch me something to eat. 
Oh, Pete, says he, what will you have; 
Says I 
give us a 
cutlet fried, 
Besides a 
plate of beans and pork, 
And mind a 
roll—outside. 
The Maine Liquor Law. 
An original and very popular Buffo Song by Pete Morris. 
TUNE.—" Drinking Song from Lucrezia Borgia." 
Now a 
bmnper of lager oh fill, fill for me, 
Give those who prefer it champagne, 
Or instead let them fill me a 
cup of bohea 
And I'll n'er call for lager again. 
22 
Pete Morris' Songster. 
Some may laugh at the cause for abolishing drinks, 
And search every place for a 
flaw, 
I 
quarrels with no man whatever he thinks, 
Yet I 
goes in for the Maine liquor law, 
The Maine liquor law, 
The Maine liquor law. 
Oh then what is the use of wearing good 
clothes 
When lager around the city flows, t 
It gives all the fast men 
Such a 
jolly red nose, 
The drinking of brandy and ice. 
But now I 
have jined the temperance ranks 
I 
no more will drink vile rum, 
I'll now conclude with this advice, 
Mind you drinking always shun. 
Kase in life you know there is many flaws 
You'll agree with pie I 
think, 
And if I've gained your kind applause, 
I 
never more will drink. 
Never more will drink, 
(In a 
horn.) 
Oh, then what is the use, & c., & c. 
Lovely Woman. 
Originally written and sung by Pete Morris. 
THOUGH much is said and sung 
About a 
woman's tongue, 
prove to you its merits 
Ere it is too long. 
To the sox I 
tune my lays, 
And adore them all my days, 
And it's my intention now 
To sing in lovely woman's praise. 
Pete Morris' Songster. 
23 
I'll prove to you that woman 
Is man's best friend, 
Sticking back and edge to him 
Till life cloth end. 
So he who'd single go 
Had better go below, 
For what man would be without a 
wife, 
Why, I 
should like to know ? 
So he who'd single go 
Had better go below, 
For what man would be without a 
wife, 
Why, I 
should like to know? 
If a 
man has got a 
wife, 
He may lead a 
happy life, 
Although, at times, the best of us 
May have a 
leetle strife. 
Woman's tongue must have its power, 
But her passion is like a 
shower _ 
In April, when there is storm and sunshine 
All within an hour. 
It's best to let a 
woman have her way, 
And let her chatter, chatter all the day, 
For though her tongue must go 
In scandal to and fro, 
What man would have a 
woman dumb, 
Why, I 
should like to know ? 
At home she's man's best friend; 
For him she'll wash and mend, 
And unto all his many wants 
She surely will attend. 
But a 
single man ' tis true 
For himself must boil and stew— 
Must wash his shirts, mend his clothes, 
Must Molly-codle too, 
A married man to happy be 
Can never, never, fail;

dog 
That hasn't got no tail. 
So he who'd single go had better go below, 
For what man would be without a 
woman I 
should like to know? 
Now a 
house without a 
fair 
Is like a 
desert drear; 
A 
garden without flowers, 
Or vegetation near; 
Like a 
pin without a 
head, 
Or a 
bedstead with no bed. 
So lads if you'll take my advice, 
You'll quickly go and wed. 
A 
single life you'll find to be 
A 
bitter, bitter pill ; 
No one to soothe or nurse you 
If by chance you're ill. 
So women I 
will show 
Are man's only joy below; 
Then What man would be without a 
woman, 
Why, I 
should like to know ? 
So women I 
will show 
Are man's only joy below; 
Then what man would be without a 
woman, 
Why, I 
should like to know ? 
The Newspaper Song. 
Originally written by Pete Morris, and sung with unbounded 
applause in all the principle Theatres, Circuses and Con-
cert Saloons in the United States. 
On. what a 
blessing 'tis that we, 
What'ere our rank or station, 
Can by the daily papers see 
The news from all the nation. 
Pete. Morris' Songster.

On every coming morn we view 
Enough to cure the vapors, 
And all we read " it must be true," 
Why, yes sirree, 
Bekase ' tis in the papers. 
The other day a 
man out West, 
Inclined to be a 
glutton, 
Eat nearly a 
whole bullock dressed, 
Besides a 
leg of mutton; 
Drank porter gallons eighty-two, 
To wash down all the capers, 
In just one hour, " it must be true," 
Yes sirree, 
Bekase ' tis in the papers. 
A 
lady in the South of France, 
Who had been ten years married, 
Was lately taken in a 
trance, 
And coffined down and buried. 
In six menths time she life came too, 
And from the grave's sad vapors 
She walked away, " it must be true," 
Oh, yes sirrees, 
Bekase ' tis in the papers. 
POSTSCRIPT. 
There is news from Nicaragua 
That came here to day, 
Which is awful horrifying; 
how six hundred thousand men were killed, 
And fifty thousand dying; 
General Walker has run away, 
And no more will cut his capers ; 
Now all of this " it must be true," 
Why, yes sirree, horsefly, 
Bekase '
tis in the papers.

Yankee Manufacture. 
Originally written and sung by Pete Morris, with enthusiastic 
approbation, to millions of citizens of this glorious con-
federation. 
TUNE— " 
Betsy Baker." 
I 
wisn I 
was in Yankee land, 
And was a 
boy again, sir, 
I'd suck sweet cider through a 
straw, 
And fish in every rain, sir. 
I'd never wander from my home 
To visit other lands sure, 
But stay at home, cat pumpkin pies 
Of Yankee manufacture. 
The people there all go-a- head, 
They never turn about, sir, 
And when the boloys go on a 
spree, 
" 
Their mothers know they're out sir ;" 
The girls can read and write, and spin, 
Are modest, chaste and fair, sure, 
No other land has got such gals 
As of Yankee manufacture. 
There is a 
spot near Boston town, 
They call it Bunker Hill, sir, 
Where Johnny Bull with Yankee lead 
Did get his stomach filled sir; 
'Twas there brave General Warren fell, 
In freedom's glorious cause, sure, 
But we had left great Washington, 
Of Yankee manufacture. 
I 
love the Yankees for their skill, 
Their perseverance too, sir, 
Their telegraphs and railroads 
Show what their sons can do, sir; 
Pete Morris' Songster. 
27 
For onions and for enterprise 
Give me the Yankee lads, sir; 
For cider, soberness and sense, 
There is none can beat their dads, sir! 
Why the Sundays there begin to claw' 
On Saturday, at eve, sir, 
And then all hands, in- doors and out, 
Their weekly labors leave, sir; 
It's wicked then for hens to lay 
Their eggs, and worse to hatch them, 
And if the boys go out to play, 
Why, the bears are sure to catch them. 
Single Blessedness.

BACHELOR'S BALL! what a 
quare looking place it is, 
Kape me from sich all the days of my life; 
Sure but I 
think what a 
burnin' disgrace it is, 
Never at all to be gettin' a 
wife. 
See the old bachelor, gloomy and sad enough, 
Placing his tay-kittle over the fire, 
He soon tips it over—Saint Patrick! he's mad 
enough, 
(If he were present) to fight with the Squire. 
How like a 
hog in a 
mortar bed wallowing, 
Awkward enough, see him knading his dough ; 
Troth ! if the bread he could ate without swal-
lowing, 
how he would favor his palate. you know. 
Pots, dishes, pans, and such greasy commodities, 
Ashes and prata skins kiver the floor; 
His cupboard's a 
store-house of comical oddities, 
Things that had never been neighbors before. 
His meal being over, his table's left sitting so, 
28 
Pete Morris' Songster. 
Dishes take care of yourselves if you can; 
But hunger returns, then he's fuming and fretting so, 
Och ! let him alone for a 
baste of a 
man; 
Late in the night when he goes to bed shiverin', 
Niver a 
bit is the bed made at all; 
He crapes like a 
tarapin, under the kiverin', 
Bad luck to the picture of Bachelor's Hall. 
The Maiden's Complaint. 
As sung by Pete Morris. 
Music, with Piano Forte accompaniment, published by Firth, 
Pond, and Co., N 
Y. 
THEY tell us that when leap-year comes 
The privilege we have; 
But ' tis an idle tale I 
vow— 
We're nothing but man's slave. 
I 
wish some one would make a 
law 
To take effect direct, 
That only man should henceforth sit, 
And woman should select. 
I 
really think it is a 
shame 
A woman can't propose; 
Instead of waiting the caprice 
Of obstinate young beaux; 
Our foolish custom ne'er allows 
A 
timid maid to choose; 
But she must listen to man's choice, 
Then take him or refuse. 
Why, if a 
woman now declines, 
If asked some thing or other, 
And thus lets one proposal slip, 
She ne'er may get another; 
But man can poke his nose around 
And pick where he's inclined to, 
Or he can let the matter pass, 
Just as he has a 
mind to. 
rzcis. 
Pete Morris' Songster. 
It clearly is a 
shameful thing, 
To say the least about it, 
That man alone should have a 
choice ; 
Male bipeds, do you doubt it? 
If custom gives the van to men 
Why don't they do their duty ; 
And pup the question " sans delay 
To every smiling beauty ?

My Grandfather was a 
Wonderful Man. 
Sung witIc unbounded applause by Pete Morris, forth., 
last 25 years. 
My grandfather was a 
most wonderful man, 
lie could do and invent, could propose and could 
plan, 
When he was at school, a 
boy very small, 
At reading and writing, why he beat them all; 
lie could dance, he could sing, he could poetry 
write, 
He could wrestle and box, he could run, he could 
fight.— 
(Spoken—Well he could fight! he once knocked 
a man so deep into a 
snow bank, that when his 
friends dug him out, he was bankrupt. 
Oh! he 
was a wonderful man, he knew everything—he 
knew Jawology, Tautology, Conchology, Etymology, 
Physiology, Noseology, 
Mineralogy, Phrenology, 
• 
and all the rest of the ologys. 
He was the boy for 
a 
song too: he once wrote a 
song of a 
hundred and 
ninety-nine verses and sung it himself; he did! it 
took him three hours and three quarters to sing it, 
because the first verse was always repeated. 
Ile 
was a 
wonderful smart man—but notwithstanding 
all that, he couldn't fool old Death: 0, no, old bones 
and scythe come along one day, and cut the old 
man down very suddenly. 
What a 
pity

Pete Morris' Songster. 
What a 
pity it is this life's but a 
span, 
For my grandfather was a 
most wonderful man. 
He sailed ' round the world without going wrong, 
lie killed a 
large crocodile twenty feet long, 
lie caught a 
large whale and brought him ashore, 
lie tamed fifteen lions and killed a 
wild boar, 
lie could change brass to copper, get diamonds 
from coal, 
lie fried at the Indies, and froze at the pole. 
(Spoken.---Well he did! 
He once sailed ' round 
the north pole saw the pole, went up to the pole, 
climb'd up the 
pole, look'd into the pole, cut 
the pole off, and brought it 
home with him; 
used it for a 
fish pole for many years—finally 
stuck it up for a 
Liberty pole; and I 
dare say it 
stands to this very day. 
0 ! he was a 
wonderful 
man. 
Why, he once upon one of his voyages, 
sailed right against the Equinoctial line, broke it in 
two, brought it home, used it for a 
fish line for a 
great while. 
My grandmother was a wonderful 
woman, too, she was a 
washerwoman—she had no 
place to dry her clothes, so my grandfather stretched 
the Equinoctial line 'round the garden fence, and 
she used to dry her clothes on the Equator. 
0 ! he 
was a 
wonderful man for inventions, what a 
pity he 
die d —) 
What a 
pity it is this life's, & c. 
He sailed to each part of Japan and Peru, 
Could tell if a 
wife to her husband was true, 
He swam the Nile over without any clothes, 
Watch papers and miniatures cut with his toes, 
He could make anything that once he had seen, 
From a 
microscope up to a 
sausage machine. 
(Spoken.--Well he could! 
And he could make 
sausages, too; he once speculated in sausages; but 
he lost in one grand speculation; he got to making 
Pete Morris' Songster. 
31 
them of bull terriers, and greyhounds, they got fight-
ing, and tore the sausages all to pieces; but then 
he tried another experiment—he made some of 
greyhound alone, but there'came along a 
little boy 
one day, whistling Yankee Doodle, and whistled the 
meat all out and left nothing but the skins lying on 
the stall; however, he lost nothing by the operation, 
for he blew up the skins and made life preservers 
and bustles of them. 
Oh! he was a wonderful 
man, and had he not died, he would have lived a 
great while—) 
What a 
pity it is this life's but a 
span,

The Quilting. 
(By Pete Morris.) 
3 TWAS down at Major Parsons' house, 
The gals they had a 
quiltin' 
Just for tu show their handsome looks 
And have a 
little jiltin' ! 
Chorus. 
Yankee lasses are the IT— 
'niversal airth betwitchin', 
They're good and true, and handsome tu 
In parlor and in kitchen. 
There was Deacon Jones' darter Sal, 
Squire Wheeler's darter Mary, 
And General Carter's youngest gal, 
That looks just like a 
fairy ! 
Yankee lasses are the U, &c. 
3 
Pete Morris' Songster. 
There was Lucy White and Martha Brown 
And Parsons' darter Betty, 
Femimo Pinkhorn, Prudence Short, 
And Major Downing's Hetty. 
Yankee lasses are the U, & c. 
But if there was a 
handsome gal, 
To make a 
fellow's heart iight, 
I 
guess it was by all accounts, 
Miss Carolina Cartwright. 
Yankee lasses are the U, Sze. 
Wal, while we were a 
whirlin' plate, 
And playin' hunt the slipper, 
Jerusha Parsons went to git 
Some cider in a 
dipper. 
Yankee lasses are the U, azc. 
But just as she had left the room, 
And got inter the entry, 
She give a 
scream, and stood stock still 
Just like a 
frozen sentry. 
Yankee lasses are the U, &c. 
We all ran out, and there, I 
swow, 
Both huggin' like creation, 
Miss Cartwright and Sam Jones we saw, 
A 
kissin' like tarnation. 
Yankee lasses are the U, &c. 
0, such a 
laugh as we sot up, 
You never heerd a 
finer, 
Says I, " 1 
rekin kissin's cheap, 
Dont you Miss Carolina ?" 
Yankee lasses are the U, ate. 
I 
wish you'd saw Miss Cartwright blush, 
Jest like as if she'd painted, 
Pete Morris' Songster. 
33 
She said—she had the cholic—and 
And in Samuel's arms she fainted. 
Yankee lasses are the U, & c. 
And now, young gals, I'd say tu you, 
When you go to a 
frolic, 
Don't let your fellers kiss and hug, 
Unless— you have the chile. 
Yankee lasses are the U, & c. 
The Gal in the Cabbage Line. 
A Parody on " Dandy, Jim from Caroline." 
(By Pete Morris.) 
My darling Jane I'd have you know, 
Is the beauty of the city, oh, 
She doesn't dress so very fine, 
But she's the darling of the cabbage line. 
For my old Mommy told me, oh, 
I 
was the best looking gal in the city, oh, 
I 
looked in her thee, I 
found it so, 
Just as my Mommy told me, oh! 
Every morning early, oh, 
You'll find her in the market, oh, 
The cabbages she sells are fine 
For she is a 
bully in the cabbage line. 
My old Mommy told me, oh, & c. 
I 
loved her for her virtues, oh, 
I'd married her but for butcher Joe, 
But butcher Joe he beat my time, 
He stole this gal in the cabbage line. 
My old Mommy told me, oh, &c. 
34 
Pete Morris' Songster. 
To Joe a 
challenge I 
did write, 
He said he'd show me a 
fist fight, 
He'd bung my eye up so prime, 
To avenge this gal in the cabbage line. 
My old Mommy told me, oh, Sze. 
At the back of Moyamensing prison, 
We met, he took me by the wizen, 
His second said I 
couldn't shine, 
'Twas this female in the cabbage line. 
My old Mommy told me, oh, & c. 
The constables they grabbed us three, 
Deprived us of our liberty, 
They locked us up in no time, 
This comes of being in the cabbage line. 
My old Mommy told me, oh, Ice. 
MORAL. 
Now city boys a 
warning take, 
Or you'll repent when its too late, 
In prison I 
am for no crime, 
But for loving in the cabbage line. 
My old Mommy told me, oh, ke. 
My Grandmother Was a most Wonderful 
Dame. 
YOU'VE heard of my grandfather's NI 
Who such marvellous deeds could 
will, 
But Lord bless your soul they're 
name, 
Compared with the feats of my 
dame; 
-onderftd skill, 
perform at his 
not worthy to 
worthy grand-  
1 
Pete Morris' Songster. 
35 
Oh, sure such a 
woman can no where be found, 
If you trayel a 
century, and search the world 
round. 
No wonder she gained such a 
glorious name, 
For my grandmother was a most wonderful 
dame. 
(Spoken.—There was a 
woman for you.—Talk 
about my grandfather; why he was only a 
patch 
of court plaster compared with my grandmother. 
Do you know that my grandmother invented the 
patent Elixir of Life, and lived to the good old age 
of two hundred and seventy? 
She used to take 
fifteen &cos of the Elixir in fifteen gallons of 
brandy every morning before breakfast—and in less 
than three months, she had a 
new pair of eyes, a 
new 
head of hair, and a 
new set of teeth. 
She did!) 
No wonder, Sic. 
She could dance, she could sing, she could fence, she 
could spar, 
But oh, at invention, she beat others by far, 
She invented—indeed of her skill I 
don't dream, 
A 
patent machine to nuke children by $teanz; 
She'd take cart loads of snuff, and still crave for 
more, 
And drank enough tea to float a 
seventy-four. 
No wonder she gained such a 
glorious name, 
For my grandmother was a 
most marvellous dame. 
(Spoken.—Thcre was a 
woman for you.—Do you 
know that my grandmother invented a 
steamboat to 
sail down the Mississippi river? 
Well, she started 
off one afternoon, about six o'clock in the morning, 
just before breakfast, with a 
whole cart load of 
passengers; she got as far as New Orleans, when 
the whirlpool took it—went round and round to the 
bottom—but it didn't make any difference to the 
steamboat, it kept going on, going on; and my 
36 
Pete Morris' Songster. 
grandmother believes that if it had not been for a 
large oyster, or the great American sea serpent, 
which must have swallowed it, the steamboat would 
have been going on to this very day—it would!) 
No wonder, &c. 
She could cure like winkin, disasters and ills, 
She beat all to nothing famed Brandreth's pills, 
She knew every manual labor and art, 
And she could make, from a 
wheelbarrow up to a 
cart, 
She could give to old age a 
pat
ent 
new *face, 
And beat every body in running a 
race. 
No wonder he gained such a 
glorious name, 
For my grandmother was a 
most wonderful dame. 
(Spoken.—There was a 
woman for you.—She in-
vented some patent yeast, to make cakes rise— all 
you had to do was to take a 
little before going to 
bed, it would make you rise at any moment you 
wished. 
Grandmother put a 
little in the yard one 
night for an experiment, first thing she knew, the 
sun began to rise about nine o'clock, it did! 
Do 
you know that my grandmother invented a 
steam-
balloon ?—Well she did—she started off one fine 
evening, with a 
new married couple, and got up so 
high that she couldn't get down again; balloon kept 
going on—grandmother lit her pipe in the moon, 
and snuffed out the sun—and when they did get 
down again ( it's a 
fact, or grandmother wouldn't 
have said so), the new married couple had turned 
completely grey, and had a 
whole flock of little 
ones. 
They had!) 
No wonder she gained such a 
glorious name, 
For my grandmother was a most wonderful 
dame

When I 
was out a 
Sleighing. 
An Original Comic Song, sung with, great applause, 
By Pete Morris. 
IT 
snowed so hard the other day, 
I 
could not wory, I 
could not play, 
And so I 
hired a 
horse and sleigh, 
Resolved to go a-sleighing. 
I 
soon put on my Sunday clothes, 
And round to Sally Russell's goes, 
And to herd did propose, 
That she would ride while yet it snows. 
She very soon gave her consent, 
But as my money was most spent, 
Tim Bobbin to me three dollars lent, 
All for to go a-sleighing. 
With bells a-ringing all the way, 
Money spent and thrown away, 
Oh, there is the devil to pay, 
When a 
man goes out a-sleighing. 
As up the Bowery I 
did glide, 
With Sally Russell by my side, 
To cut a 
dash both of us tried, 
,When we went out a-sleighing. 
But some naughty boys to raise a 
din, 
To snowball us they did begin. 
One mashed my hat down o'er my chin, 
Then stove Miss Russell's bonnet in. 
Miss Russell she began to cry, 
I 
turned around to say oh, tic, 
When a 
snow-ball banged me in the eye, 
When I 
was out a-sleighing. 
Bells a-ringing all the way, & c. 
I'd been very glad to turn back, 
Because one of my eyes were black. 
But we followed up the rail-road track, 
Resolved to finish sleighing. 
4 
J.11.L'ALA: • 
At something next our horse took fright, 
And started off with all his might, 
lie banged the sleigh both left and right, 
And sent Miss Russell in a 
snow bank tight, 
The horse with me away he sped, 
And left Miss Russell nearly dead, 
And the wind blew the false curls all off her 
head, 
When we went out a 
sleighing. 
Bells a-ringing all the way, Sze. 
For assistance Sally she did shout, 
While I 
managed to turn the horse about, 
But cursed the hour that I 
came out, 
To go with her a-sleighing. 
To get her out, Sal did me tease, 
And soon I 
went. to her release, 
But it is a 
wonder she didn't freeze. 
For she stuck fast in snow up to hcr knees, 
But what was worse for poor Miss Russell, 
In the snow amid the tussel 
The strings they broke, and she lost her 
bustle, 
When I 
was out a 
sleighing, 
Bells a-ringieg all the way, Sze. 
We started home with heavy hearts, 
When there came along two butchers' carts, 
And smashed our sleigh in twenty parts, 
When I 
was out a-sleighing. 
So since our horse and sleigh was gone, 
Poor Sal and I 
had to walk home, 
And for the damages we done, 
I 
had to pay a 
pretty sum. 
But my bills are paid and all is right, 
And folks when you go home to night, 
Oh, think upon my doleful plight, 
But don't go out a-sleighing. 
Bells a-ringing all the way, Sze. 
She was such a 
Nice Young Gal. 
(Originally sung by Pete Morris.) 
BLOW on, ye winds, and crack your cheeks, 
But don't blow me away, 
For since I've met with fortune's freaks, 
I 
now will sing my lay! 
Then you must know, I 
fell in love, 
With one whose name was Sal, 
She loved me in return by Jove, 
She was such a 
nice young gal. 
Tol lol, to! lol, Szc. 
Her eyes they were as black as sloes, 
Her mouth was rather wide, 
Five inches long her little nose, 
With a 
bump upon its side; 
Her teeth they were like ivory white, 
Forget 'emI never shall; 
For once she did my finger bite, 
She was such a 
nice young gal. 
She used to dress so very chaste, 
Short sleeves to show her muscle ; 
And only two yards round the waist, 
With lots of natural bustle. 
In pink stripe frock and pea green boots, 
And when we walked Pall Mall, 
Folks gazed upon our separate suits, 
And said—" What a 
nice young gal." 
She had such a 
pleasant appetite, 
To please her I 
was willing ; 
So fast she put things out of sight, 
I 
soon spent my last shilling; 
If a 
handsome gown piece caught her eye, 
'Twas ' buy it for me, Hal!" 
Of course, I 
straightway did comply, 
She was such a 
nice young gal. 
40 
Pete Morris' Songster. 
Now comes the end of all my woe, 
One day she was taken ill, 
Then to her house I 
straight did go, 
I 
recollect it still. . 
The door was opened, in I 
went 
Forget her I. 
never shall, 
I 
soon found what her illness meant, 
She'd got a 
little gal! 
Oh, Sal, why what a 
cheat you be, 
No more you shall me wheedle, 
For, ' pon my word, it wasn't me, 
And so I'll tell the beadle. 
My peace of mind is broken quite, 
To be content I 
never shall, 
Unless I 
should meet here to-night— 
Another nice young gal. 
What will you take to Drink 7 
(Originally sung by Pete Morris.) 
Tun other night I 
walked out, and strolling up so 
grand, 
I 
stopt in a 
place to hear a 
song, about " What are 
you going to stand ?" 
Now that we know is a 
common phrase—but if I'd 
got the chink, 
When asked to stand, my motto is " what will you 
take to drink ?" 
I 
stayed and drank very late, until I 
couldn't stand, 
So to the police I 
was took, as if it had all been 
planted, 
His worship said, with an angry frown, " you're a 
very nice fellow I 
think, 
What have you to say for getting drunk ?" 
Pete Morris' Songster. 
41. 
(Spoken.— Say? why you old buffer, you—what 
should I 
say, but—) 
What will you have to drink? 
His worship laughed, and with a 
smile told me to 
quit the place, 
So off I 
went, resolved was I no more to show 
my face, 
But scarce outside the door I'd got, when down 
I 
thought I'd sink, 
For a 
lot of boys kept singing out " What will 
you take to drink ?" 
Curse the drink, cried I, ashamed, it's the cause of 
all my strife, 
So no more thinks I, I'll be blamed, so I 
went and 
got a 
wife, 
In a 
little while we had a 
child, of perfection quite 
the pink, 
But the first words it learnt to say was, " Daddy 
what'll you take to drink?" 
So you see the trouble I 
got in, and scorned by 
every one, 
I'll now conclude with this advice, mind you drink-
ing always shun, 
For in life you know there's many flaws, you'll agree 
with me I 
think, 
But if I 
gain your kind applause " What will you 
take to drink ?"

When we took the field brave Frederick led the

When he gave command

The rain a

The clouds were rent asunder 
By lightning's vivid powers, 
The night both drear and dark, 
Our poor devoted bark, 
As she lay, all that day, in— 
A 
rose tree in full bearing, 
had fresh flowers fair to see, 
One rose beyond comparing, 
For beauty attracted me, 
Eager then to win it, 
Lovely, blooming, fresh and fair, I 
found  
Giles Stroggins courting Molly Brown,

TUNE—" My Helen is the Fairest Flower." 
Written and sung by Pete Morris. 
MY 
Mary has the longest nose, 
In which she greatly takes a 
pride, 
So large the shoes her feet inclose, 
That insects strive in vain to hide. 
Her hair is of the brightest red, 
Which lights her footsteps in the dark; 
Her mouth is large for hiding bread, 
Her voice is sweeter than the lark. 
Yes, Mary has, &e.

In Mary there is nothing green, 
She'll let you kiss her if you can, 
Her mother says she's not sixteen, 
Though twice as strong as any man. 
But far ahead of these,. of all, 
The charms my Mary can combine, 
She's six foot six, and I 
can call 
This charming little creature mine.

The Raging rianaval.

As sung by Pete Morris. 
COME listen to my story, ye landsmen, one and all. 
And 1'11 sing to you the dangers of that raging 
For I
CI
az lone
:
 of many who expects a 
watery grave, 
For I've been at the mercies of the winds and the 
waves. 
I 
left Albany harbor about the break of day ; 
If rightly I 
remember ' twas the second day of May ; 
We trusted to our driver, altho' he was but small, 
Yet he knew all the windings of that raging Canal. 
It seemed as if the Devil had work in hand that 
night, 
For our oil it was all gone, and our lamps they gave 
no light. 
The clouds began to gather, and the rain began to 
fall, 
And I 
wished myself off of that raging Canal. 
The Captain told the driver to hurry with all speed— 
And his orders were obeyed, for he soon cracked 
up his lead ; 
46 
Pete Morris' Songster. 
With the fastest kind of towing we allowed by 
twelve o'clock, 
We should be in old Schnectedy right bang against 
the dock. 
But sad was the fate of our poor devoted bark, 
For the rain kept a 
pouring faster, and the night it 
grew more dark; 
The horses gave a 
stumble, and the driver gave a 
squall, 
And they tumbled head and heels into that raging 
Canal. 
The Captain came on deck, with a 
voice so clear and 
sound, 
Crying, cut the horses loose, my boys, or I 
swear 
we'll all be drowned; 
The driver paddled to the shore, altho' he was but 
small, 
While the horses sank to rise no more in that raging 
The Cook she wrung her hands, and she came upon 
the deck, 
Saying, alas! what will become of us, our boat it is 
a 
wreck! 
The steersman laid her over, for he was a 
man of 
sense, 
When the bowsman jumped ashore, he lashed her 
to the fence. 
We had a 
load of Dutch, and we stowed them in the 
Hole ; 
They were not the least concerned about the welfare 
of their Soul; 
The Captain went below, and implored them for to 
pray, 
But the only answer he could get was, .
Nix come 
Ruse, nix fis staa 
Pete Morris' Songster. 
47 
The Captain came on deck with a 
spy glass in his 
hand, 
But the night it was so dark he could not diseiver 
land; 
He said to us, with a 
faltering voice, while tears 
began to fall, 
Prepare to meet your death, my boys, this night on 
the Canal ! 
The Cook she being kind-hearted, she loaned us an 
old dress, 
Which we raised upon a 
setting-pole as a 
signal of 
distress; 
We agreed with Restoration aboard the Boat to 
bide, 
And never quit her deck whilst a 
plank hung to her 
side. 
It was our good fortune, about the break of day, 
The storm it did abate, and a 
boat came by that 
way, 
Our signal was discovered, and they hove along 
side 
And we all jumped aboard and for Buffalo did 
ride. 
I 
landed in Buffalo about twelve & clock; 
The first place I 
went to was down to the dock; 
I 
wanted to go up the lake, but it looked rather

Billy Bally. 
Says Fred how do you do, and whar have you been 
so long ? 
Says I, for the last fortnight I've been on the Canal, 
For it stormed all the time, and thar was the devil 
to pay, 
When we got in Tonawandy Creek, we thar was 
cast away. 
48 
Pete Morris' Songster. 
Now, says Fred, let me tell you how to manage 
wind and weather; 
In a 
storm hug to the tow-path, and then lay feather 
to feather, 
And when the weather is bad, and the wind it blows 
- a 
gale, 
Just jump ashore, knock down a horse—that's 
taking in the sail. 
And if you wish to see both sides of the Canal, 
To steer your course to Buffalo, and that right true 
and well, 
And should it be so foggy that you cannot see the 
track, 
Just call the driver aboard and hitch a 
lantern on 
his back. 
What are you going to stand 7 
(As sung by Pete Morris.) 
QUEER sayings are now all the go, 
You cannot say I'm wrong 
But here is one I'd have you know, 
I've worked up in a 
song. 
Where'er I 
go, in every street, 
I'm shook, sirs, by the hand, 
No matter who it is I 
meet, 
It's come, what are you going to stand ? 
This morn I 
went to get some cash, 
To swell at the west end, 
Resolved I 
was to cut a 
dash, 
I 
met with an old friend : 
I 
told him of the errand I'd been, 
He shook me by the hand, 
I'm glad to hear it, old boy, says he, 
Come, what are you going to stand ? 
Says I, I 
doesn't mind a 
drop, 
My spirits it will rouse, 
So off we toddled to a 
shop, 
Quite near to Astor's house. 
Inside a 
lot began to shout, 
As if it had been planned, 
But it is not oft we catch you out, 
Come, what are you going to stand ? 
My expenses amounted to a 
dollar, 
My cash was growing shorter, 
The liquor now down they did swallow 
As though it had been water. 
Just then a 
wench my arm did pinch, 
her hide I 
could have tanned, 
Says she, for old acquaintance sake, 
Come, what are you going to stand ? 
Egad, thinks I 
this will not do, 
So I 
bolted from the lot, 
But run against a 
man I 
knew, 
Em a 
hundred yards I 
got. 
I 
told him of the set I 
left, 
Says he I 
understand, 
Now since you've escaped from such a 
crew, 
Come, what are you going to stand ? 
My song I 
will conclude with this, 
You'll all agree I 
think, 
That this, my friends, is quite the age 
Of intellect for drink. 
So, when the boy puts out the lights, 
I'll take the manager by the hand, 
There's been a 
devilish good house to-night, 
Old boy, come, what are you going to 
stand ?

The Tee- Total Society. 
As sung by Pete Morris. 
I'M come to exhort you so free, all you that so 
fond of the bottle are, 
And when you my arguments see, every one will 
become a 
tee-totaler. 
Of gin, brandy, rum, wine, or beer, to drink is 
a 
great impropriety, 
Of such trash l'd have you steer clear, and join the 
tee-total society. 
An old man that was troubled with corns, that 
scarcely the stairs could he hobble up, 
He used to drink beer out of horns, and all sorts 
of liquor would gobble up, 
His corns having all left one by one, and now he's 
the pink of sobriety, 
And pray, how was all this done? why he joined 
the tee-total society. 
T'other day my young pigs, and old sow, I 
found 
to be far gone in liquor, 
In my family I 
this can't allow, to temperance being 
a 
sticker, 
They had with grain from the brewer been fed, 
But now they shall share in sobriety, 
Coffee grounds and tea leaves instead, and they 
shall join the tee- total society. 
A 
tee-totaler Vother day died, the doctor his friend 
did entice out. 
Examined his stomach inside, and they say took a 
large lump of ice out, 
This can't be true, for if ever we are ill, of brandy 
we take a 
small moiety, 
And melt you know, brandy it will, it has been tried 
by the tee- total society. 
Pete Morris' Songster. 
51 
I wander about doing good, our society pays all 
my charges, 
Preaching, two hours at least, to coal heavers work-
ing on barges, 
But they said, If you carried our coals, of beer 
you'll soon sec the propriety, 
But ah ! they are sad wicked souls, they wont join 
the tee-total society. 
Folks ask what makes my nose so red? I'll tell and 
end all this puzzling, 
It a'nt drink what gets in my head, its blushing to 
see so much guzzling, 
Drops of brandy we take two or three, as medicine 
and no impropriety, 
And put some in our gruel and tea, it's allowed by 
the tee-total society. 
The people laugh at me, oh, dear, and puts my 
mind in sad order works, 
And cries out whenever I 
appear, how gets on the 
Temperance water- works, 
But I 
tells them I 
don't care a 
dump, and preaches 
away on sobriety, 
And for example drinks out of the pump, since I 
joined the tee-total society. 
In our progress there's nothing excels, in our efforts 
we never do slumber, sir, 
We have dug six and fifty new wells, and erected 
of pumps a 
great number, sir, 
I 
have here some Temperance tracts, of a 
most 
gratifying variety, 
They record some wonderful facts, 
about the 
tee-total society. 
A drunken beggar I 
very well know, quite lame 
and as thin as a 
rat he was, 
Led by a 
dog he would go, through the streets, for 
blind as a 
bat he was—

You'll scarce believe what I 
say, he's now the pink 
of sobriety. 
lie's got fat and can see as clear as day, since he 
joined the tee-total society. 
One night in my house every week, I 
bolds forth 
on the beauties of Temperance, 
Because when in public I 
speak, Pm subject to a 
good deal of imperance, 
After a 
lecture on coffee they sup, or tea if they 
like for variety, 
I 
charge a 
shilling a 
cup, since I 
joined the tee-
total society. 
Don't be adieted to Drinking. 
Originally sung by Pete Morris. 
As early one morning down the Bowery I 
walked, 
The sky being shady and clouded, 
When all of a 
sudden my senses were shocked, 
Just to see how the gin-shops were crowded. 
The folks ran out and in, as if running a 
race, 
And they poured down the liquor like winking. 
A 
glass now and then, is very well in its place, 
But don't be addicted to drinking. 
Now these cold frosty mornings when raising your 
head, 
From your pillow you'll find it quite handy, 
To knock cff, as soon as you turn out of bed, 
A thumping, good bumper of brandy. 
A tumbler of runt in a 
basin of tea, 
Is a 
very good thing to my thinking, 
Yet a 
pint of good liquor would better agree 
But don't be addicted to drinking 
Pete Morris' Songster. 
53 
A glass at eleven, I've heard some folks say, 
Is a 
very good thivg, so it is miss, 
But a 
man shouldn't drink every hour in the day, 
In case it unfits him for business. 
Then about one o'clock, when your dinner you get, 
Your spirits at that time are most sinking, 
Take two or three glasses by way of a whet, 
But don't be addicted to drinking. 
Enjoying a 
segar after dinner you get, 
Perhaps fOr an hour and a 
quarter, 
Nothing will give such a 
relish to it, 
As a 
tumbler of brandy and water. 
Then perhaps you'll feel inclined for a 
doze, 
You can scarce keep your eyelids front winking, 
Take three or four glasses your mind to compose, 
But don't be addicted to drinking. 
To think about business as soon as you wake, 
Of course you will think it will be time, 
Then four or five glasses more at least you must 
take, 
If you wish to be sober by tea- time. 
Then spending your evening at liberty's arms, 
Of your pretty fair maid you keep thinking, 
While in hot gin and water you're toasting her 
charms, 
Mind you don't get addicted to drinking. 
Now a 
bumper at parting you cannot do less, 
It will just keep you from yawning, 
But believe me, dear friends, if you drink to ex-
You ee-illsY 
Nr have a 
devilish headache in the morn-
ing. 
Now such, my dear friends, is my own sober plan, 
And I 
hope you are my way of thinking, 
For 
just joined the temperance society, and am 
By no means addicted to drinking.

The Age of India Rubber. 
(As sung by Pete Morris.) 
LET steam and gas pursue their way, 
For now 'tis my intention, 
A word or two in praise to say, 
About a 
new invention, 
No matter where you chanced to be 
'Tis plain to wise and lubber— 
This is by every thing we see, 
The age of India Rubber. 
Oh, the Rubber, the India Rubber, 
The Rub, Rub, Rubber, Rubber. 
Our gents, when dressed, once look'd so well, 
As we can e'er allow, man— 
No difficulty ' twas to tell 
Their difference to the ploughman. 
But now our peasants, I 
declare, 
The gentry beat by notches— 
For they India Rubber smock frocks wear, 
And call them Mackintoshes. 
Oh, the Rubber, the real India Rubber. 
As stationary you'll allow, 
We once used to discern it— 
But ' tis not stationary now, 
To every thing they turn it. 
Its former use now much declines, 
With nobler things it copes, sir— 
Instead of rubbing out our lines, 
They make it into ropes, sir. 
Oh, the Rubber, the wonderful India Rubber. 
Each judge, with India Rubber wig, 
Is stow much to be dreaded; 
The article plays such a 
rig, 
It makes them all light headed. 
Pete Morris' Songster. 
55 
Our counsellors prefer it too, 
When guilty culprits trouncing, 
But I'm not much surprised they do, 
For they're very fond of bouncing. 
Oh, the Rubber, 
• The bouncing India Rubber. 
Boots made of India Rubber, you 
See every where I'm told, sirs— 
And so you all can buy a 
shoe 
That never has been soled, sirs, 
Run up a 
score, ' tis only fair, 
Whatever bills they show, sirs— 
If you only India Rubber wear, 
You can rub out as you go, sirs. 
Oh the Rubber. 
The convenient India Rubber. 
A 
cold from sleeping in damp sheets 
You never need be dreading, 
For nothing is there now that beats . 
The India Rubber bedding. 
All those who have of children care, 
To them my song confesses, 
If they India Rubber aprons wear, 
They'll never spoil their dresses. 
Oh the Rubber, 
The water proof India Rubber. 
Elastic belts our beaux prefer, 
To show off well their muscles, 
Our belles, who wish to make a 
stir, 
Wear India Rubber bustles, 
American demands are great, 
The article they're fetching, 
It suits them well I 
needn't state— 
They're noted so for stretching. 
Oh, the Rubber, the stretching India Rubber. 
)Nt 
56 
Pete Morris' Songster. 
In both houses of parliament, 
That are to be erected, 
It is the ministers' intent, 
When they've their seats selected, 
On India Rubber seats to lean, 
For they say it no disgrace is, 
'Which ever party they may screen, 
To vote for easy places. 
Oh the Rubber, the patent India Rubber. 
The Unlucky Fellow. 
A3 sung by Pete Morris for the last 25 years. 
Is there any one here what's got a 
desire 
To wed with a 
grumbling, wife? 
He had better by for poke his head into the fire 
And at once put an end to his life. 
When I 
married my love, I 
thought her a 
dove, 
But when married I wished myself dead, 
For, in less than a 
week she got tired of love, 
And she tore all the hair off my head. 
Oh, craekey, oh, dear, 
My heart is so full that Pm ready to cry, 
Oh, what a 
poor unlucky fellow am I. 
The very first mishap filled my eyes full of tears, 
She brought me home children two, 
Says she, you must father these two little dears, 
But says I, I'll be blowed if I 
do. 
Then she said with a 
sneer, how dare I 
presume 
To think of my ease being hard, 
She knocked me down three pair of stairs with a 
broom, 
Then bolted me out in the yard. 
Oh, crackey, oh, dear, 
A man who's by sorrows thus trundled about, 
Is worse than a 
hog with a 
ring in his snout. 
Pete Morris' Songster. 
57 
But much worse than this was the rest if you'll 
mark, 
I 
thought I 
should really go wild, 
I 
trod oil our little cat's tail in the dark, 
She moulrowed and woke the young child. 
Then she up with her fist, she put me in a 
fright, 
She swore she would make me rue it, 
She made me go sleep in the cupboard all night, 
Though I 
said I 
didn't go for to do it, 
Oh, crackey, oh, dear 
A man that is married must weep and bewail, 
Like a 
dog with a 
tea kettle tied to his tail. 
It was one Monday morning, I 
swear it is true, 
I 
met with a 
shocking bad loss, 
She told me to buy some meat for a 
stew, 
Says I, I 
will love, don't be cross. 
But what mishaps in this world we oft find, 
Before I 
could get it home to her, 
A large Newfoundland dog came up smelling be-
hind, 
And he stole all the meat off the skewer. 
Oh, crackey, oh, dear, 
A man that is married, his pleasures are small, 
Just like a 
poor dog what ain't got no tail at all. 
The Nice Young' Man. 
Sung with .unbounded applause, 
By Pete Morris. 
THERE was a nice young man, his name was 
Brown, 
lie wore a 
short frock coat, 
The hair on his temples was plastered down, 
And his collar on the side of his throat. 
3* 
Oh, his hands they were white, his pants they 
were tight, 
And his hair was the color of tan; 
The ladies all said, whether widow, wife, or maid, 
That he was such a 
Nice Young Man! 
Ri tol, & c. 
This young man Brown spoke soft and low, 
And was civil to every body; 
The temperance pledge with him was all the go, 
For he never drank a 
glass of toddy, 
At the name of a 
play he would run right away, 
For the playhouse was the 
devil's 
frying-
pan ; 
He read nothing but tracts, and he stuck to them 
like wax, 
For he was such a 
Nice Young Man! 
Ri tol, & c. 
Three times on a 
Sunday, and once a 
Sunday 
night, 
He went to church quite regular ; 
He was so polite that he didn't fall asleep quite, 
But sang hymns with a 
fat dowager 
Oh he turned up his eyes like a 
duck when he 
Blowed his nose when the sermon began, 
When the parson had done, to shake hands with 
him he'd run, 
And the parson said he was a Nice Young 
.31a21. 
Ri tol, & c. 
To a 
christening party Brown invited himself, 
And offered for to stand god-pappy, 
There was none so frisk as he, when he handed 
round the tea, 
lie made them all so jovial and so happy. 
Pete Morris' Songster. 
59  
Oh, talked to the pappy, and he kissed the little 
baby; 
Oh, the mother admired his plan, 
how beautiful he talks! 
But where's all my 
silver forks? 
They were in the pocket of the Nice Young 
Man! 
Hi tol, & c. 
They took Lim off to the police office, 
And the first thing his worship said, 
Was " We've been looking for you, for a 
year or 
two, 
And I'm glad you have been discovered!" 
In spite of his good looks, he was upon their bad 
books, 
They sent him off in the police black van, 
They didn't stretch his wizen, but for two years 
in prison, 
And they locked up the Nice Young Man! 
Ri tol, &c. 
ENCORE VERSES. 
Brown served out his time and came out prime, 
And looked much nicer than ever, 
lie just changed his name to play the same game, 
And alter the scene of his endeavor. • 
Oh he tivaddled out of town before he settled 
do \V 
n, 
And followed the self-same plan ; 
He looked wise and demure, as stiff as any 
skewer, 
And they all said he was a 
Nice Young Man ! 
Ri tol, &c. 
He found a 
gold watch in his landlord's room, 
And he took it right away ; 
For fear some one to steal it should presume, 
The landlord would be in bad way. 
6o 
Pete Morris' Songster. 
The landlord discharged his maid and his clerk, 
Thinking them in the stealing plan ; 
If he had suspected Brown, he would have 
knocked him down, 
For suspecting such a 
Nice Young Man! 
Ri to), & c. 
In the course of his sinning, he grew very short 
of linen, 
He managed to drop into a 
dry good dealer's 
skirts, 
In preaching of Parson Sacks, over a 
bundle of 
tracts; 
He made shift to steal a 
dozen of shirts! 
In spite of his looks, the shopinan noticed his 
hooks, 
And straight for the police officer ran, 
First of all they knocked down, when they took 
up Mr. Brown, 
And transported this Nice Young Man ! 
Ri tol, & c. 
MORAL. 
Now ladies all, both little and tall, 
Pray.listen to what I've been describing ; 
This history so true that I 
dedicates to you, 
And a

When a 
husband you select, of course, we ex-
pect, 
That you will pick out the best you can, 
But nothing can be worse, than that hollow-heart-
ed curse, 
A smooth faced sneaking Nice Young Nan !

Silent Sam; or, I never says nothing to 
Nobody. 
(As sung by Pete Morris.) 
W HAT a 
shocking world this is for scandal, 
The people grow worse ev'ry day; 
Every thing serves for a 
handle, 
To take people's good names away. 
In backbiting and railing, each labors 
A 
low fault of others to show body; 
I 
could tell such a 
tale of my neighbors, 
But I 
never says nothing to nobody. 
Tol de rol dol di da. 
'Tis a 
snug house in which we reside, 
The people who live in the next door 
Are bother'd completely with pride, 
Such as I 
never saw before. 
Outside of doors they don't roam— 
A 
large sum of money they owe body; 
People call, but don't find them at home, 
But I 
never says nothing to nobody. 
Tol de rol dol di da. 
There's the baker who lives in great style, 
Whose wife is a 
deuce of a 
fright, 
Of new dresses she has a 
great pile, 
And they sleep out of town ev'ry night; 
Country cottage complete in a 
state, 
Determined not to be a 
low body; 
He's been pull'd up three times for short weight, 
But I 
never says nothing to nobody. 
Tol de rol dol di da. 
There's the butcher so greasy and fat, 
When out he does nothing but boast— 
He struts as he cocks on his hat, 
As if he supreme rules the roast.

Tales of himself and his riches, 
Consequence always a

His ugly old wife wears the breeches, 
But I

There's the methodist priest of great fame, 
Who I 
see very often 0-o by, 
his bosom is filled with love's flame, 
And he visits a 
girl on the sly. 
All this now I 
daily do see, 
Of course he is but a 
so-so body; 
But as it is nothing to me, 
Why I 
never says nothing to nobody. 
Tol de rol aol di da. 
There's the new married couple so happy 
They seem quite the essence of love 
lie calls her before ey'ry sappy, 
My ducky, my darling, my dove. 
At home there is nothing but strife, 
Fights and quarrels enough to o.erflow body, 
In filet quite a 
eat-and- dog life, 
But I 
never says nothing to nobody. 
Tol de rol dol di da. 
Oh, I 
could tell such a 
tale of my neighbors, 
All around me, both great and small, 
That really without any failure, 
I'd greatly astonish you all. 
But here my short ditty ends, 
I 
don't wish to hurt high or low body, 
And I 
wish to keep in with my friends, 
So I 
never says nothing to nobody.

Nowadays. 
As sung by Pete Morris. 
Music published by Firth, Pond & Co., N. Y. 
ALAS! how every thing is changed, 
Since I 
was sweet sixteen, 
When all the girls wore home-spun frocks, 
And aprons nice and clean ; 
'With bonnets made of braided straw, 
That tied beneath the chin, 
The shawl laid neatly on the neck, 
And fasten'd with a 
pin. 
I 
recollect the time, 
When I 
rode father's horse to mill, 
Across the meadow, rock and field, 
And up and down the hill: 
And when " our folks" were out at work, 
It never made me thinner, 
I 
jumped upon a 
horse bare-back, 
And carried them their dinner. 
Dear me! young ladies nowadays, 
Would almost faint dway 
To think of riding all alone, 
In wagon, chaise or sleigh ; 
And as for giving " pa" his meals, 
Or helping " ma" to bake, 
Oh dear ! ' twould spoil their lily hands, 
Though sometimes they make cake. 
When winter came, the maiden's heart 
Began to beat and flutter; 
Each beau would take his sweetheart out 
Sleigh-riding in a 
cutter. 
Or, if the storm was bleak and cold, 
The girls and beaux together 
Would meet and have the best of fun 
And never mind the weather! 
64 
Pete Morris' Songster. 
But now, indeed it grieves me much 
The circumstance to mention, 
however kind the young man's heart, 
And honest his intention ; 
He never asks the girls to ride, 
But such a 
man is caged; 
And if he sees her once a 
week 
Why, surely, they're " engaged!" 
John Smith, Esq. 
Written and sung by Pete Morris. 
Tuns— Carnival in. Venice. 
A 
SUBJECT I 
have got for a 
song, 
And I 
really think it's new, 
So if you list for a 
moment 
I 
will sing it all to you ; 
There is a 
man of great renown, 
John Smith's his name I 
think, 
He married a 
hundred girls one day, 
And still he's the ladies' pink ; 
John Smith, John Smith, 
And still he's the ladies' pink. 
John Smith one day to Boston went, 
Was drown'd from off the boat, 
That very day in this great town, 
He stole a 
man's new coat, 
A 
girl with him did run away 
He married her forthwith, 
Arrested he was for bigamy, 
To prison went John Smith. 
John Smith, he robbed a 
bank once, 
To Texas he did go, 
That very instant in this place, 
He danced Jim-along Joe; 
Pete Morris' Songster. 
6 
He has been murdered scores of times, 
To pick pockets he did strive, 
He was hung by the neck ' till he was dead, 
dead, 
But still he is alive. 
There are some folks by the name of Green, 
But, they're not so green as they look, 
Other " nice young men " by the name of 
Brown, 
Get their living by hook or by crook; 
But Smith's a 
name you don't often see, 
its so astonislongly rare, 
That if a 
man is introduced to Smith, 
Why at him he will stare. 
John Smith I 
vow is here to-night, 
Ah! I 
see him over there, 
That man with those pretty teeth, 
Such nice curly hair. 
I 
hope, sir, you'll not offended be, 
Miss Smith you needn't sigh ; 
In fact all that I've snug tibout— 
Indeed it's " all my eye," 
The Modern Bean. 
As sung by Pete Morris. 
Music published by Firth, Pond & Co., N.Y. 
Iii: sits in his breakfast parlor, 
The clock is just striking one, 
His eyes are all sunken and blood-shot, 
His toilette is hardly begun. 
his mother below in the kitchen, 
With tears in those dim eyes, now see, 
Has mended a 
hole in his coat sleeve, 
And is darning a 
rent iji the knee. 
66 
Pete Morris' Songster. 
He growls at the toast and coffee, 
Votes ev'ry thing ducedly flat, 
Calls sulkily for the last paper 
To find some vexation in that ; 
Tells mother (poor woman) he'll leave her 
And board at the Howard or Astor, 
If when he gets up with the headache, 
his breakfast don't come along faster. 
Arises and strokes his moustaches, 
lie finds that the color is faint; 
Last night they were glossy and raven, 
This morning the tinge of grey paint. 
His neckcloth is so unbecoming, 
And (horrors!) his purse rather low, 
lie wonders his father don't struggle 
To raise him a 
dollar or so. 
Attired at last in his costume 
lie sallies forth, eye glass in hand; 
His mouth is a 
moving volcano, 
That smokes on a 
more modern plan; 
us smile and his bow are exquisite; 
His teeth look alarmingly white, 
They were purchased on credit down Broad-
way, 
And payable, likely, at sight. 
His hair is embalmed in " Macassar," 
Voted safe just to gaze at, not touch, 
While puppies are lost in amazement, 
That their species could alter so much. 
He stares at the ladies who pass him, 
Shakes hands with the most moneyed man, 
Politely asks after his daughter, 
has seen her,,he cannot tell when. 
He raves of Alboni and Sontag, 
Thinks Jenny Lind passably fine, 
Quite murders the French and Italian, 
And faints on a 
small glass of wine. 
Ms form by the tailor is fashioned, 
his air the most foreign you've met, 
this wit is so far fetched and shallow, 
And his head has lodgings to let. 
He's married, alas! about forty, 
To a 
bit of a 
shrew, so they say, 
Who fell deep in love with his whiskers, 
As false as his heart, by the way— 
He swore by those relics he loved her, 
He offered his heart in his hand, 
She whispered an asthmatic." Yes Sir," 
And now he obeys her command. 
Marry in Haste and. Repent at Leisure. 
As sung by Pete Morris. 
Music published by Oliver Ditson, Boston. 
How silly to marry, why did I 
not tarry, 
'Tis foolish to marry in haste; 
For little's the pleasure repenting at leisure, 
Nor is it at all to my taste. 
My lover seern'd kind and so very refined, 
, 
Such whiskers and nice curly hair ; 
his marmozet tricks got my heart in a 
fix, 
That till now was a 
stranger to care ; 
Oh! dear! 
Oh! 
Ah! 
How silly to marry—why did I 
not tarry ? 
'Tis foolish to marry in haste ; 
For little's the pleasure repenting at leisure, 
Nor is it at all to my taste. 
68 
Pete Morris' Songster. 
Scarce a 
month has flown hy, I 
do nothing but sigh, 
And my husband does nothing but snub; 
Between me and von he ne'er comes home till two, 
And says he's detained at his club. 
To increase my despair, his jet curly hair, 
discover'd was Use, ( how I 
cried!) 
When he doesn't go out it's thro' having the gout, 
And his beautiful whiskers are dyed. 
Oh! dear! & c. 
He's quite an old beau and too late I 
know 
I 
shall never be happy again ; 
For now I 
can see it was money not me; 
What cruel deceivers are men. 
Some say serve me tight I 
took such delight 
In coquetting hut kept my heart free ; 
If fate should ordain that Pm single again, 
What a 
smart little widow Pll be. 
Oh I 
dear! 
&c. 
A Romance or laitr,ix and. Low Life. 
As originally sung by Pete Morris. 
TUNE—" Lord Lopel." 
LORD PERKINS he wooed Lady Mary Brande, 
John Thomas her maid, Mary Ann ; 
Lord Perkins he was the master, and 
John Thomas he was the man. 
"Now tell me, John Thomas," Lord Perkins 
he said, 
"Now tell me, John Thomas," said he : 
"Dost thou think thou would'st marry my 
lady's. maid, 
And thou could'st have my ladye ?" 
"Now marry, good master," John Thomas re-
plied, 
"Now marry, good master," he said, 
" 
I 
rather the lady were my bride, 
Than marry the lady's maid." 
"And what is thy reason ?" Lord Perkins, he 
said, 
"And what is thy reason?" said he; 
"My lady is fair, but my lady's maid, 
Is fairer than my ladye." 
" 
But she hasn't the grace," said John Thomas, 
"poor wench, 
" 
And she hasn't got the manner; 
And her ladyship speaks Italian and French 
And plays on the grand pehanner." 
"What good, John Thomas," Lord Perkins, he 
said, 
" 
Will French and Italian do man ? 
"If a 
wife has got one tongue in her head, 
'Tis enough for any woman." 
" 
And singing and playing are pretty things, 
But who, except a 
gaby, 
But knows that no wife ever plays or sings 
After bringing her lord one baby?" 
"Now tell me, John Thomas, now tell me, 
pray, 
Can Mary Anne sew and cook ? 
For these things, I 
own, are more in my way, 
When I 
for a 
wife would look." 
"My Lord, she can cook; my Lord she can 
sew; 
" 
My Lord, she can stitch and hem; 
But I 
own that, for my part, I 
doesn't go 
Into marriage for such things as them."

Pete Morris' Songster. 
"Enough, John Thomas," Lord Perkins, he 
said, 
"Enough, John Thomas," said he; 
"I will go and marry my lady's maid, 
And you may have my ladye." 
At St. George's Church, in Hanover Square, 
They were married all on one day: 
Lord Perkins he wedded the maiden, 
And John Thomas the lady gay. 
The marriage service a 
Bishop read, 
in a 
most impressive manner ; 
Lord Perkins went home to his quiet home-
stead, 
John Thomas to his pebanner. 
And so they were suited and so content, 
And rejoiced in both their wives, 
And, which I 
wish to every gent, 
Lived happy the rest of their lives. 
The Nervous Family. 
AIR— " We're all Noddin." 
As sung by Pete Morris. 
W E'RE all nervous, shake, shake, trembling, 
'We're all nervous, at our house, at home. 
There's myself and my mother, my sister and 
brother, 
If left all alone, are all frighten'd at each other. 
Our dog runs away if a 
stranger's in the house, 
And our tabby eat, too, is frightened at a 
mouse ; 
And we're nervous, shake, shake, trembling, 
We're all nervous, at our house, at home. 
Pete Morris' Songster. 
71 
We all at dinner, shake. shake, at carving; 
And as for snuffing, we oft snuff out the light. 
Last night every one did to snuff the candle try, 
But my wife couldn't do it, nor my sister, nor 
could I. 
Come give me the snuffers, said mother, with a 
flout, 
I'll show you how to do it, and she snuff'd the 
candle out. 
For she's so nervous, shake, shake, Sze. 
My nervous wife can't work at her needle, 
And my shaking hand spills half my cup of tea ; 
When wine at dinner my timid sister's taking, 
It's spilt on the table for so her hand is shak-
ing. 
My mother taking snuff, very carefully cloth try, 
To pop it up her nose, when she pops it in her 
eye. 
For she's so nervous, & c. 
Our nerves foretell all the changes of the weather; 
We are so nervous we're frightened at each noise ; 
We have got a 
private watchman to guard the 
private door, 
But since we have had him, we are frightened 
more and more, 
For he falls 
asleep, and we've found out too 
that he, 
In respect to his nerves, oh, he's quite as bad as 
we, 
And we're all nervous, Sze. 
Umbrella. Courtship. 
(As sung by l'ete Morris.) 
A 
BELLE and a 
beau would walking go, 
In love they both were pining; 
The wind in gentle gales did blow, 
An April sun was shining. 
72 
Pete Morris' Songster. 
Though Simon long had courted Miss, 
He knew he'd acted wrong in 
Not having dared to steal a 
kiss: 
Which set her quite a-longing. 
Tol ol ol. 
It so occurred as they did walk, 
And viewed each dale so flow'ry, 
As Simon by her side did stalk, 
Declared the sky look'd show'ry. 
The rain came to her like a 
drug, 
When loudly he did bellow, 
" 
Look here, my love, we can be snug, 
For I've got an umbrella." 
Tol ol ol. 
Quick flew the shelter over Miss; 
Now Simon was a 
droll one, 
He thought this was the time to kiss, 
So from her lips he stole one. 
She blush'd ;—the rain left off, and he 
The umbrella closed for draining; 
" 
Oh! don't," says she, " I 
plainly see, 
It hasn't left off raining." 
Tel ol ol. 
Now Simon when he smok'd the plan, 
The umbrella righted, 
He grew quite bold, talked like a 
man, 
And she seemed quite delighted. 
Their lips rang chimes full fifty times, 
Like simple lovers training: 
Says she, " These are but lovers' crimes; 
I 
hope it won't leave off raining." 
Tol ol ol.
