THE FIG TREE
Once upon a time there was a beautiful little girl who had a step-mother, who was very
mean. One day when the step-mother went out, she left some figs on the table, and told
the little girl not to touch the figs. However, the little girl was so hungry that she ate one fig.
Pretty soon the step-mother came back and when she looked at the figs, she said; “There
is one fig missing. Now you must die.” So she killed the little girl, and buried her in the
yard.
When the father came home, he said; “Where is my little daughter? I do not see her.” But
the wicked step-mother said; “Oh she went out to the woods.” When the father was seated
at the table he happened to look out of the window, and saw a beautiful fig tree growing in
the yard. “Oh what a beautiful fig tree”, said the father “Go and bring me that big fig, for I
want to eat it.” So the step-mother went out to the tree, but when she was about to pull the
fig, she heard the step-daughter singing:
“Mamaita, mamaita, no me arranques mi cabello Que tu misma me has matado (1) Per ua
higo que ha faltade”
The step-mother was so frightened that she ran back into the house. So the father said,
I will go and pick the fig myself. When he was about to pull the fig, he heard the beautiful
voice of his daughter singing;
Mama, mama, do not pluck my hair For you have killed me (1) For a fig that was missing.

“Papaita, papaita, no me arranques mi cabello Que mi madre me ha matado Per un higo
ha faltado.”

Daddie, Daddie, do not pluck my hair For my mother has killed me For a fig that was
missing.
The father became so incensed that he went into the house and threw the wicked step-
mother away. Then he unburied his daughter, and they both lived very happy ever after.
