Project Detail 
This project is supported by the Archie Green Fellowship of the American Folklife Center at the 
Library of Congress. 
The purpose of the Immigrant Women Artists Oral History Project is to examine the occupational 
folklife of first-generation immigrant women artists living in Oklahoma and the networks of 
support that allow them to pursue their vocations in a 
new environment. This series of interviews 
examines not only the cultural and occupational traditions that these artists nurture in straddling 
multiple cultural identities, but also the translation of an artist's occupational life between 
multiple cultural and physical spaces. 
Legal Status 
Scholarly use of the recordings and transcripts of the interview with Hui Cha Poos is 
unrestricted. The interview agreement was signed on February 14, 2021.

About Hui Cha Poos... 
Hui Cha Poos discovered dance in middle school in a 
physical education class. The freedom and 
joy she experienced still drive her today. The teacher, choreographer, and performer was born in 
Korea and migrated to Oklahoma City with her family at age eight. After taking formal dance 
classes in her late teens, Poos worked as a 
professional dancer in Los Angeles, returning to 
Oklahoma City with an expansive dance vocabulary. Currently, faculty at the University of 
Central Oklahoma, Poos is also a 
co-founder of RACE, a 
dance collective focused on diversity 
and community outreach. Perhaps her best known work is the Hip Hcp Nutcracker, created 
especially for her company. During the 2020 pandemic, she co-produced Finding Carlos, a 
movie based on the Hip Hcp Nutcracker, incorporating multiple dance communities. 
In this interview, the artist explains the differing expectations she encountered in her immigrant 
family growing up, in the OKC Korean community, and in the public school system. She talks 
about the necessity of teaching diverse approaches to movement along with respect for different 
cultures and histories. She describes some of her international touring, including an inspiration 
return to Seoul, South Korea, and her new dance work to help young women cultivate positive 
body images despite social media pressures.

This is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder with the Oklahoma Oral History 
Research Program at Oklahoma State University. Today is February 14, 
2021, and this is a 
remote interview with Hui Cha Poos for the Library cf 
Congress' OcciApational Folklfe Prcject funded by the Archie Green 
Fellowship. I 
am in Tulsa, and Hui, you are in Oklahoma City where you 
are a 
dancer/choreographer. You have your own dance company, and you 
also teach at the University cf Central Oklahoma in Edmond. I'm looking 
forward to learning more about you and your work. Where were you born, 
and how long did you reside there? 
I 
was born in Seoul, Korea, and I 
lived there until right ... before my eighth 
birthday, so I 
turned eight here in the United States. 
Any particular sensory memories cf Seoul bE fore you lc ft? 
So many, so many. I 
was fortunate enough to go back as a 
young adult, and 
then also recently a 
couple of summers ago I 
got to go back and revisit. Oh, 
I 
went back and searched for my childhood area. It looks completely 
different now. The scape of the land is, you know.... Seoul is a 
huge city, 
and so there's just buildings everywhere. I 
do remember, I 
remember being 
in a 
little area and the same kids. We grew up all together. I 
remember a 
corner store where the only TV, that was black and white, in the 
neighborhood would play, and we would get our treat, which was, like, you 
know, a 
jar of milk a 
week, like once a 
week. We would sit in front of the 
TV and watch television, watch black and white TV, if that ages me at all. 
(Laughs) I 
have very, very many sensory... and I 
have a 
lot of sensory 
memories of being here for the first time and, you know, flushing the toilet 
for hours at end at my uncle's house and all the things that you do when you 
discover a 
new country.

[00:02:10] 
Little Thunder 
Right, yes, I 
was going to ask you how you ended iAp coming to Oklahoma 
instead cf someplace else in the States.

Cha Poos 
Yes, my uncle who was from Henryetta originally and married my aunt, I 
joke that he didn't realize he was marrying all eight of us. They took, I 
think 
they spent a 
lot of time and years gathering money and doing all the 
paperwork. It was like a 
ten-year process once we got here. They brought us 
here: me, my two brothers, my mom, and my dad, and my grandmother. We 
all traveled and stayed with them in their three-bedroom house for a 
couple 
of years until my dad could get us in a 
place. Thank god for a 
program like 
Section Eight because.... I 
didn't realize it at the time, but our first house 
was a 
Section Eight home. I 
always, when I 
talk to people and they have 
issues with social help and public programs like that, I'm always like, 
"Well, you don't realize that I'm the outcome of that program, and if there's 
me, then how many other wonderful people are out there that you're going 
to discourage because you don't know somebody." 
Exactly. What expectations did your family have once you got in Oklahoma 
City? What expectations did they have for you? 
I 
think it was a 
strange dichotomy of expectations that they had 
preconceived as Korean family and also these new ideas and dreams that 
might have been a 
glimmer in their eye once we got here. We were very 
much set in the old Korean ways of, you know, my role was to be a 
wife and 
a 
mother, which are wonderful, wonderful things. It's just when I 
got here I 
stepped a 
little further into the American dream, I 
think, than they did. They 
were bothI think I 
was both inspiring and bewildering at the same time to 
them as a 
little girl because I 
completely went against what they were 
teaching. 
How about your experiences in public school? 
We, my brothers and I, were put into public school right away. We took a 
summerI think we got here in January or something like that, and we 
waited until the fall to go school. We took that time to learn as much English 
that could be thrown at us as possible. We learned the phrases, you know, 
"Hi, nice to meet you," "Where is the restroom," "Can I 
get some help." I 
remember knowing just those just four or five phrases. In the fall, we got put 
into second grade for me and then whatever my brothers were in, but then 
half the day was spent in the lower grade. I 
spent half the day with my 
regular classmates and then the other half with a 
couple of years or one year 
younger so that we could get kind of the fundamentals as we were learning. 
5 
It was a 
really interesting awakening and upbringing. We were new. We 
were the only family in our elementary school that were Korean, so 
everything was really new to everyone. I 
got accustomed to getting a 
lot of 
attention. (Laughter) 
[00:05:53] 
Little Thunder 
Cha Poos 
[00:07:55] 
Little Thunder 
Cha Poos 
So how did you first get interested in dance? 
The elementary school that I 
was at actually, I 
had the great pleasure of 
having an African American teacher who taught us PE. Her name was Freda 
Jones. She actually went on to get her master's degree and doctorate and 
was teaching at UCO with me, so we got to have a 
reunion. Anyway, in part 
of the PE program, she danced us a 
lot. I 
remember we put on a 
program 
that had to do with aerobics, and so it was just called aerobic dancing. I 
tell 
this story very vividly because I 
remember it so well. I 
was lying on the 
floor, my legs are up, and we're getting ready to start. It was the theme song 
of Hill Street Blues. I 
don't know if you remember that and recall. It was 
from the ' 70s, I 
think. (Sings a 
few notes) I 
just remember my body feeling, 
or my spirit feeling like it was lifted off the ground. I 
just remember 
thinking, like, "Oh, this is what pure joy and freedom feels like." I 
remember feeling that for the first time then. Dance classes or whatever, my 
parents couldn't afford to put me in a 
dance class, but I 
would watch the 
videos, you know, whenever they came out. I 
remember thinking I 
knew 
how to dance because I 
had learned all of Janet Jackson and Michael 
Jackson's videos, so of course I 
was like, "I'm a 
dancer." Then going into 
"ballet training," there's arguments these days about what it is to be a 
trained dancer. At that time, I 
didn't know better, so I 
thought training was 
going into a 
technical program. I 
remember going, "Wow! I 
don't know any 
of that!" (Laughs) I've been dancing my whole life. Yeah, that's the first 
time I 
recall that sensation. 
And you did some cheerleading, which is extremely athletic. Has that 
impacted your approach to dance at all, do you think? 
Of course, yeah. I 
mean, there's some grit and a 
level of execution I 
think 
that you find in cheerleading and an incredible level of teamwork because 
you're literally relying on people not to drop you from, you know, two and a 
half stories or whatever that you you're up. I 
was always the flyer. There's a 
trust level that I 
think, you know, if you're partnered in any way in dance, 
you have to have. There's a 
lot of that relying on other people, and there's a 
lot of that sense, even though the dancers.... Actually, there's quite a 
bit 
acrobatics now in dance, and lifting. Right now, during COVID times, 
6 
there's not so much, but usually there is. I've actually gotten to use both 
worlds, straddle both worlds.

So talk a 
little bit more about maybe your first few dance lessons, or, you 
know, some c 
f 
the bases you were covering bE fore you went on to school 
and began your education there. 
I 
met a 
woman—so back in the ' 90s, there was a 
local basketball team here 
in Oklahoma called the Cavalry, and it was a 
CBA basketball team. This 
was pre-Sonics, pre-Thunder, pre- any of that, and there was a 
woman that 
was running [the Cavalry Sundancers] named CeCe Farha. I 
tried out for 
that team because I 
was here in the City and I 
really wanted to just continue 
dancing and being in that world. She got hold of me and just said, "You're 
going to come to my studio, you can start training with me." So it kind of 
just started from there, and then I 
was teaching for her. Then I 
started 
working at Lyric [Theatre], and then that's kind of when my career took off. 
How cool. So at Lyric you were doing your first choreography for theater, I 
think. 
Well, so I 
started just performing for them. 
I 
see. 
Yeah, and then when I 
moved back in ' 98, I 
spent a 
year just kind of 
wondering, really, really asking myself what I'm going to do here. There 
wasn't much to do professionally and especially because, you know, I 
had 
done some things in LA that had to do with the industry and there was no 
industry really to speak of here at that time. I 
went on to teach at a 
couple of 
universities and ended up at UCO. Somebody gave my name to Jerome 
Stevenson at Pollard Theatre, and so he was actually the first person I 
choreographed for. Then I've since worked with CityRep in Oklahoma City, 
and then Lyric, I've done a 
couple of shows with that. 
Well, let's talk a 
little bit about your LA experience because that was pretty 
foundational, too, I 
think. You went there at nineteen (is that right) to 
choreograph or pei form as a 
prc fessional dancer. I'm wondering what 
expectations you had when you got there and how they were met or not met. 
7 
Cha Poos 
[00:14:37] 
Little Thunder 
Cha Poos 
I 
was nineteen when I 
started training, like I 
was telling you, the official 
training, and my teacher was a 
ballet dancer. I 
got thrown into that world of 
technical dancing. I 
think it was a 
good mix of being able to do foundational 
funk and groove and then meeting with the technical dancer. That's kind of 
when I 
met who I 
was supposed to be as a 
dancer, I 
think. Was the perfect 
marriage of those two worlds. I 
was about twenty-three, I 
think, when I 
moved to LA, which was actually pretty older to be an LA dancer. Luckily, I 
looked seventeen until I 
was about thirty, so, you know, it was fine. I 
got 
there and worked for a 
year doing various jobs just to be able to stay there. 
One day I 
remember thinking to myself, "You know, I'm waiting tables. I'm 
teaching dance. I'm doing the things that I 
could be doing at home, so why 
am I 
here? Why am I 
giving up my life and everybody that I 
know to 
struggle in this city?" I 
gave everything up, and I 
quit all my j 
obs. I 
said, "If 
I 
don't make it in a 
year, I'm going to go home." Like the week after I 
quit 
everything, I 
got an audition. I 
had gotten an agent at that time. I 
got a 
call 
for Batman and Robin, which is a 
film, the Arnold Schwarzenegger and 
Uma Thurman one. I 
went out for it, and I 
got the job, like, right away. 
I 
never went back to my other jobs afterwards; I 
just went from job to job to 
job. I 
got to do some really, really neat things and meet some awesome 
people. What I 
found myself doing every job was, a 
quarter of it I 
spent 
enjoying it and really doing the work, and then three-fourths of that job I 
was stressed about the next job. I 
actually use this as a 
teaching thing for my 
students now, is you have to be in there, in the moment, enjoying 
everything, which is a 
little easier to say and to do when you're not dealing 
with an insurmountable amount of rent at that time. For me, so it was just 
stress-filled. I 
thought that the enjoyment would be worth the stress. I 
found 
that the few times that I 
had gone back home to teach, and to do master 
classes, and work, and set works for students and my studios and stuff, I 
just 
got so much more joy out of those. I 
felt so much more present, and I 
felt so 
much more just at peace with myself and who I 
am and what my purpose 
was. I'm a 
big fan of writing down pros and cons. I 
remember doing that 
one day, and I 
just remember thinking to myself, "I 
need to—I've got to 
make a 
decision. I've got to make the decision. It goes against everything 
I've been working for the last five years, and it goes against everything that 
I 
thought I 
knew," but I 
had to follow my soul. 
One cf your teaching experiences was at a 
high school, I 
believe, in 
Oklahoma City. Can you talk about that and how that was kind cf a 
turning 
point, also? 
For sure. So a 
woman named Mary Ann Shelley, she was, actually she was a 
clogger. (Laughs) Somehow she had gottenI think she was a 
teacher, 
certified teacher. She got into the program at Douglass [High School], and 
8 
she taught them PE. What she really did was teach them dance. She did 
teach them clogging, but she also wanted to bring in community dancers and 
have them be exposed to them, as well. She brought me in to teach. This is 
so funny that you bring this up because I 
had a 
conversation with one of 
those kids recently. Her name is Tynesia, and she's a 
kid that I.... We 
just 
have kept in touch ever since. She came up to me on the first day of class, 
and I'm talking, this gymnasium full of fifty kids. I 
was just walking in 
there, and she said, "I 
remember seeing you walk in there. I 
remember 
thinking, `Asian woman going to teach me about hip hop."' You know, I 
mean, that happened to me more than once. It was like a, "What is she...." 
Anyway, the way that Tynesia tells it is much funnier. She said, "You turned 
on the music and started dancing. We all just looked at each other, and they 
looked back at you." After that class that first day at Douglass, she came up 
to me, (she was in the ninth grade) and she said, "I 
want to do what you do. 
How do you do that?" 
So she and I 
have had a 
relationship ever since. I 
set her up at the studio 
where I 
trained, at CeCe's studio, and CeCe's been great because anytime I 
ask her to set a 
scholarship up, she will do it. This this little girl came to 
classes with me. I 
picked her up and took her to class for at least three years. 
Then she moved out to LA, danced for a 
little while, and now she works out 
there for the government. Anyway, long story short, if nothing else, I 
was 
meant to teach there so that I 
can meet this girl because she's amazing. I 
taught there for two years. Just off and on I 
would go and set works, and 
then we would do a 
show. Then another story that came out of that 
experience was that I 
met a 
guy named Carlos who was one of the best 
dancers I've ever seen, like, anywhere. He had had run-ins with the law and 
just didn't have a 
whole lot of support. Fast-forward ten years later, and I've 
now got the company RACE Dance. We're now doing a 
show called the Hip 
Hcp Nutcracker, and I've based the lead, called Carlos, after this kid. This 
guy now has a 
doctorate degree or is going for his doctorate and is now the 
admissions director at Langston University. 
Little Thunder 
That is.... 
Cha Poos 
Incredible stories that have come from my 
life, and I 
just find myself just 
baffled that I've gotten to be a 
part of these experiences. 
[00:17:56] 
Little Thunder 
That is such a 
great story, and we'll come back to pick iAp some on those 
points, too. You founded your own company, RACE, in 2008. Can you 
explain what that acronym stands for and what your goals were? 
Cha Poos 
Sure, so the acronym is Radical Application of Creative Energy. It actually 
lived in my head, off and on, for about five years before I 
bit the bullet. I 
9 
was preoccupied with other things. I 
was having babies and raising them and 
trying to make everything work. Unfortunately, my husband and I 
got a 
divorce, and I 
found myself with this just incredible extra time that I 
had 
never had before. I 
didn't want to fill it with stress and tension and anger 
and all the things that, you know, normally come with that. I 
actually just 
filled it with this company because I 
had time and it had been living there. I 
remember having a 
conversation with my dance soulmate, I 
call him, Adam 
Parson. He has a 
company in LA. I 
remember he and I 
were talking one 
night, and I 
said, "I 
want to start this company. I 
just don't know what I'm 
doing. I 
don't know how to do it." He said, "Just get some dancers together 
and start." I 
was like, " Start what?" He said, "Start dancing. Start dancing; 
things will fall into place." So that's what we did. We started dancing; we 
put a 
show together. Right after we did our first show, I 
think, is when I 
started to file. It was a 
year-long process. That's when, you know, 
everything started—the answers started to come. "Why are we doing this?" I 
realized the answer is, "Because it didn't exist before." All the things that I 
had questioned when I 
first moved back, "What am I 
going to do here, how 
am I 
going to keep training, how do I 
find dancers," those were all answered 
because I 
started the company. 
[00:20:05] 
Little Thunder 
And one cf the things that you addressed in particular was this desire to 
kind cf destigmatize the idea that dance for young men.... 
Cha Poos 
We started the company, and then it kind of appeared to us that there were 
no real groups of men that dance together that I 
could see in the professional 
world. I 
mean, there are definitely all kinds of groups that dance. Break 
dancers get together; street dancers get together. Recognized-professionally 
and paid dancers, there weren't a 
group of guys, and so we started Men of 
RACE, which was started by one of my friends, John Ariete, who was 
originally from Phoenix. It was really kind of cool because we got to show 
that it's cool to be a 
guy and dance. Normally at a 
dance studio in Oklahoma 
you'll see one or two in the studio. Now we started to see that there is more, 
there are more boys dancing now, and I 
hope that that's one of the reasons. I 
like to think that, that it happened that way. Now we're actually back to the 
collective. The idea went from this company to then Men of RACE, and it 
was two separate entities. Then we actually, a 
couple of years ago, decided, 
"Hey, let's just create this collective where we can allow people that are 
professionals in all the genres that they don't have to do ballet, jazz, and 
modern and all of them to be in this elite group," but actually that we 
recognize, "Hey, you're really great street dancers. Why don't you become 
part of our collective?" Now it's a 
collective of all people who dance. It's 
been a 
great growing of the company in the ways that I 
feel like it needed to 
grow, expansive, less judgmental, more enveloping and inviting, and more 
community-based, which is what we like to think that we are of. 
10 
[00:22:19] 
Little Thunder 
Cha Poos 
Well, one cf your early signature pieces, and as you say, Carlos inspired it, 
was the Hip Hop Nutcracker. Can you explain a 
little more how the piece 
came about? 
We talked about what's important to us, and we did want to include the 
community. In correlation with that time in my life, I 
was also developing 
the dance education program at UCO. I 
was graduating teachers who had 
BA degrees, who could go and teach in public schools. We had placed about 
five, I 
think, five to seven teachers in these public schools, so I 
had 
connections to OKCPS [Oklahoma City Public Schools]. If you look at the 
demographics or the contextual factors of all of Oklahoma, those are usually 
the programs that are a 
little bit more lacking in opportunities. We wanted to 
invite those schools and invite those kids and start something that they could 
have ownership of that wasn't just, "Hey, you get to be in our show." It was, 
"Hey, this is our show together." We created, and we needed a 
show to do 
that with. It just seemed like the right show because the storyline is pretty 
vague. You know, they go somewhere, but there's not a 
whole lot of 
context, you know, inside of everything. There was an opportunity to be 
able to bring in different groups, right, so I 
rewrote the story initially. Trust 
me; it has gone through many, many changes. 
Different people have added to it and made it better every year, so this is 
our, this would have been our eighth year this last year. We couldn't do it 
this year. The last iteration we did, I 
think, was almost perfect. What we did 
was change the story from Clara to Carlos. We changed the perfect nuclear 
family into a 
single mom who is raising her son. Carlos didn't know his 
father, which was convenient for us because then we could use his father as 
the nutcracker. You know, instead of the sweets and all of these perfect 
make-believe lands, we went to the land of possibilities between a 
father and 
a 
son. We went to the land of hidden treasures. The possibilities between a 
father and a 
son was important because, you know, a 
lot of the 
demographics of OKCPS kids, there's a 
lot of children who are from single-
parent families. I 
think the reality is, we have a 
lot of systematic things that 
are in place to keep families from functioning the way that they should, you 
know, the prison system, drugs, all of those political things that affect that 
community. 
We wanted to bring that to life but then also the hidden treasures, you know, 
that's everybody else in your life that's not that person that's missing, 
teachers, grandparents, aunts and uncles, cousins who are there. Yes, things 
are unfair, but we also can sometimes look at what we do have. It's this full-
circle story about Carlos and his realizing that he is exactly who he needs to 
be and has what he needs inside of himself. I 
felt it was important to share 
11 
that story, but also for these kids to go from.... A 
lot of their performances 
that they do in their schools aren't always supported, especially the boys, 
because they get bullied. Then [for] them to be able to go from that to, you 
know, going to OCCC [Oklahoma City Community College], which is a 
beautiful, beautiful theater, and dancing with professional dancers and being 
treated like one, and seeing their families come to it, and really just, they 
feel like stars, which they should, you know. They're the ones being 
featured. It's been a 
one of those, just, I 
would do it every year for the rest of 
my life if I 
could. 
[00:26:37] 
Little Thunder 
Cha Poos 
Right. I 
hope you get to resume them soon. I 
want to come see that 
sometime. You work quite a 
bit as a 
choreographer and pel former, touring 
also, and I 
wonder f 
you can talk.... We'll talk separately about your trip to 
trips to Korea, but I 
wonder fy ou can talk a 
little bit about some highlight 
touring moments for you when you lc ft the country and went abroad. 
Sure, I 
think the longest I 
was gone was in Tokyo for six months. I 
was there 
performing. I 
think, like, it wasn't a 
full submersion, but it was definitely 
longer than.... I 
was, you know, more than just a 
visitor, more than just a 
tourist. We were there, and we got to see, truly, how sweet Japanese 
people.... I 
mean, just the population itself, they're just really, really sweet 
people. It's neat because it ties me connection-wise with my ... because we 
have quite a 
few Japanese international students that come from Japan to 
study at UCO. I 
have such a 
kinship with them because I 
just, I 
know their 
spirit, and being able to be there as a 
visitor was really fun. Besides that, 
I've been to Italy, to London, to Vancouver a 
lot. My 
friends and I 
that were 
living in LA, we started a 
workshop that's based out of Vancouver, so I 
think three years ago we had our twentieth anniversary, which was.... 
Little Thunder 
Oh, my gosh! 
Cha Poos 
[00:28:42] 
Vincent Paterson came to teach. Vincent did a 
lot of choreography for 
Michael Jackson, and he taught the " Smooth Criminal" choreography.... I 
just thought, "Wow, this is...." 
Little Thunder 
When you were learning Michael Jackson yourse f 
you never imagined 
you'd meet.... 
Cha Poos 
I 
never imagined, yeah. Then, like I 
told you, and then New York and LA, I 
frequent quite a 
bit. 
[00:28:59]

Little Thunder 
You also had a 
pretty—your first trip back to Korea was kind cf a 
revelation. Can you talk about what happened, what you experienced there?

[00:32:13] 
Little Thunder 
When I 
was young, being new here being a, I 
think it was alien. They called 
us aliens. It's what we were called. I 
remember thinking, "Wow, 
everybody's calling me an alien. I 
don't think I'm an alien." As a 
kid, you 
don't realize it's a 
different kind of meaning, but it was very foreign. I 
think 
it was so important to my father.... Actually just a 
quick little note is that 
my father passed away six years ago today. It's Valentine's Day. 
I'm sorry. 
Well, it's okay. Actually, I 
was talking to a 
friend today, and I 
was thinking, 
you know, I'm not sad anymore. It's more just nostalgic and sweet because 
of the memories I 
have of him. Also, the Valentine's Day thing, like, I 
think 
that that was kind of a 
gift for my mom because they just shared such a 
beautiful love, and it makes sense to me that he would have made it until 
this day. Anyway, my father was one of those citizens that was like, "Hey, 
we're here. We're not going back. You need to be learning English. We're 
speaking English every day. You're going to be a 
citizen of the United 
States." We were very submerged in the Culture here, and I 
spent all of my 
adolescence trying not to be Korean. Then I 
got to be an adult and realized, 
"Oh, my god, I'm not Korean enough," based on the Korean people around 
me. I 
still get that sometimes at the Korean restaurant or the store. They just, 
you know... and so I 
was very insecure about my Koreanness, that is until I 
went back to Korea. 
I 
studied, and I 
took the classes, listened to the podcast every day for months 
just so I 
could get by. I 
don't know what I 
was trying to do, if I 
was trying to 
pretend to be Korean or if I 
thought, "Okay, whatever." I 
was just going to 
be in it. I 
got there, and everybody wanted to just speak English with me, A, 
and then, B, I 
was Korean enough because I 
was just Korean. I 
look Korean, 
and they, to me, they don't think of me any differently. It was this kind of, I 
call it, a 
cultural hug that I 
got from actual Korean people in Korea. So when 
I'm here now, when I 
go to the market or wherever, I 
don't feel like I 
need 
to prove anything to anyone because I'm accepted because I'm just who I 
am. It didn't bother a 
whole nation of people. It only bothers me, so I 
let that 
go. 
Well, thank you for sharing that. So when you're teaching at UCO, what is 
your philosophy cf dance? What do you try to communicate? 
13 
Cha Poos 
[00:34:22] 
Little Thunder 
Cha Poos 
I 
think the biggest thing for me is that the dancers are able to express who 
they are while they're dancing. A 
lot of times, you know, a 
lot of kids by 
that point haven't even asked that question of themselves, so sometimes it's 
just getting them to relax enough to be able to just enjoy it. Also, getting 
them autonomous because I 
think as a 
teacher my biggest gift to them is 
their independence.... When they leave, they can go, and they're assured. 
They can do what they need to do by themselves, that, yes, we go with them 
on their little shoulders, question them, and ask them things and talk to 
them, but that they are autonomous in their actions and their careers and 
their decision making. Also that they ask so many questions. They're in 
college. They're in the prime of their lives, to be rebellious and to be 
inquisitive. Questions are my favorite because what are you here for if 
you're not here to question everything? I 
mean, that's college, you know? If 
I 
get the student that's like, "What did I 
do wrong today," I'm always like, 
"I don't know. You tell me." We have fun. We have a 
really good time. I 
always kind of say, "You know, I'm driving this bus. You're going to get on 
for a 
little bit, and you're going to get off for a 
little bit. While you're on the 
bus, I 
hope we're singing some songs and having a 
really great time. You're 
a 
part of this journey, and I'm a 
part of your journey. We're not on the same 
bus forever, so while we're together, let's enjoy it." 
Well, you talked about the hip hcp influence on your own work, and you 
loved listening to that music growing iAp. When you teach it in your classes, 
you also have spoken about how you try to teach respect for the culture and 
try to get the students to recognize if that isn't their own positioning, that 
it's important to make a 
distinction between sort cf paying homage and 
appropriation. How do you draw those lines? 
Yeah, I 
think it's actually a 
really interesting time that we're living in 
because a 
lot of questions have come up. Some things have even made me 
question things that I've done in the past of, "Hey, did I 
even think you 
knew that?" This is material that doesn't necessarily, that isn't made exactly 
from my culture or from my position in my life. So how do I 
take it and 
borrow from it and give honor to it? What I 
say is, you know, if we're 
always so worried about, "Do I 
have permission to do that," then some 
things are going to die. The idea is yes, let's borrow from each other's 
cultures, but let's respect it by knowing the history of it. Let's respect it by 
naming the people who've given. Let's respect it by sharing with each other, 
you know, the true values of that culture. There are definite things, 
historians and people that have come along that have guided and shifted the 
paradigm for that certain thing. Instead of just teaching the dance movement 
in my classes, luckily we're in technology times. 
14 
We're able to share. I 
have a 
Facebook group and have all these things, so 
I'm always sharing videos, YouTube videos, KRS-One talking about the 
root of hip hop and how it came over. There's all kinds of things that you 
can share to give more information. There's a 
whole street dance culture 
here in Oklahoma City. One of the things that I 
haven't done yet because 
COVID but I 
hope to do is to bring in a 
street dancer here that's local. Also, 
I 
think, in the fall we're working on bringing Bradley Rapier, who was one 
of the original.... He started a 
crew in LA called the Groovaloos, and he 
trained with all of the original dancers. It's really about, you know, how do 
you respect it? You respect it by not claiming it for yourself, A. You respect 
it by—one of the first things I 
do when I 
go into classes, I 
say, "I'm not hip 
hop. I 
don't listen to it every single day. I 
don't go street dance every Friday 
night. That's not where I 
am in life, but here's the people who do. If you 
want to do it, then you've got to learn how to do it." 
I'm a 
conduit more than anything, but I 
think, knowing that, then I 
can teach 
in the way that I 
know how to teach. Luckily, my teachers were all men 
from California, and so their history is.... I 
get to borrow from their history 
a 
little bit because they were my teachers. I 
think women who do hip hop or 
some of the coolest things in the world are b-girls and women who do hip 
hop and are able to.... You know, I 
need to be able to pass that down. I 
need 
to be able to share that because I'm the only person in the position in my life 
that had the same experiences that I 
had. If I 
mute myself because I'm not 
from that culture, how does that really help? That's my 
justification of it. 
I'm sure there are arguments against it, but that's, you know, that's my 
story. 
[00:38:30] 
Little Thunder 
You also have been the co producer cf a 
movie called Finding Carlos, which 
came out 2019. Is that right? 
Cha Poos 
Just this year, actually, 2020. 
Little Thunder 
Just 2020, one c 
f 
your pandemic prc 
jects. Can you talk about how the movie 
came about and the role played by your dance company in the movie? 
Cha Poos 
Yes, so when we couldn't do the show because OCCC had shut down, I 
was 
talking to one of my good friends, Lance McDaniel, who until recently ran 
the deadCenter Film Festival, and we were actually in the pool, one of the 
safer places you can be during the pandemic. This was summer; this was 
probably mid-June. I 
remember talking to him and saying, "Hey, we can't 
do Hip Hcp Nutcracker this year. I 
have an idea of trying to do a 
film." He 
had been talking to me about this project that he was looking for, that was 
sponsored by the Oklahoma, by the state, actually. We looked at each other 
at the same time, and it was like, "Let's make a 
movie. Let's just make it a 
15 
movie." My 
version of it, it was just, "Let's take a 
video camera and follow 
us around while we do the dances." His version of it was, "Let's make a 
feature film with, you know, casting and story and script and everything." 
We were able to be a 
part of every single bit from the get, and anything 
dance related, I 
was in charge of. The company and I 
and the leadership of 
my team, we got together and sat down and said, "What do we want to tell 
with the dance portion of the story?" 
What we realized was, one of the things that has always been lacking in the 
Nutcracker, the original Nutcracker, is a 
sensitivity to culture. They do very 
much appropriate a 
lot of cultures in that show, and, you know, God bless 
him, the Nutcracker isn't what it is without the Nutcracker. It is what it is, 
you know. Now that we're a 
little more seasoned and know a 
little bit more 
about how to navigate this new world, we thought, "Let's use this as an 
opportunity to give the culture back to the culture, from which it was 
stolen." We found a 
group. We found several, actually, the Mexican 
Folklorico group, which exists already—and it's all groups that have been 
around for a 
long time. It wasn't like we brought together a 
new group. 
There was the Native [American group] Hastylez which is a 
family, 
actually, of brothers who did break dancing, which to me is like, "Kaboom! 
Let's just break all the stereotypes." What's interesting about them is, their 
children are the ones who did the cultural dancing. There was a ... Fancy 
Dance. Then what did D'Angelo [Sleeper] do? There were two different 
dances. 
[00:41:45] 
Little Thunder 
Cha Poos 
Little Thunder 
Cha Poos 
What dance was it? Yeah.... 
I 
think it was just called Traditional. 
So then Traditional, yeah. 
Traditional and then [Fancy]. Then their fathers came out and did break 
dancing. Then the third was an Asian American perspective. It was actually 
my idea to not just have one Asian culture but to bring several because the 
idea of the monolithic, "Hey, you're Asian. You must know this." That was 
actually written into the script. We had Korean, Vietnamese, (this girl 
named ... I 
forget her name) she was Korean, but she actually grew up in 
Kazakhstan) and then West Indian. We had this whole group of different 
Asian cultures dancing together, and then we finished our dance off with K-
pop, (Laughter) also my idea. It was a 
really fun way to explore, "Hey, what 
can we do better?" Another thing we did better was, you know, in the 
background of the show. Not just the cast, but in our crew we were really 
mindful of, "Hey, let's hire African American makeup artists. Let's hire 
different people of different persuasions and different ethnicities," because 
16 
we wanted to speak on it on every realm of it. I'm really proud of it, not just 
that the movie, the production, I 
think, is going to be a 
classic Christmas 
film but also just that we followed what the principles that we felt like were 
important and we stood on. 
Little Thunder 
Cha Poos 
[00:44:04] 
Little Thunder 
Cha Poos 
[00:45:59] 
Little Thunder 
Cha Poos 
And expanded the dance community in Oklahoma quite a 
bit through that. 
Yeah, we've hired, I 
think—and we had a 
senior group, as well. We had, I 
think, seventy-one dancers in full. We got to hire some street dancers that 
came in and worked with us, and then, of course, the company, and then the 
Academy, so we had seventy-one dancers in that movie at some point. 
So cool. So you produced Trace, I 
believe, which was a 
totally collectively-
created piece in 2019. How did you approach the collective creation part cf 
that? 
Very reluctantly. (Laughter) That was the last of our leadership group. The 
way that we, the company, functions is, I'm labeled the executive director or 
the founding director or whatever, but really I 
don't do anything fully by 
myself. There is a 
team of four other people that are our leadership team. I 
think I 
was the last one to come around to the idea of this collective thing 
only because I've done so much on my own, like, by myself for such a 
long 
time. This was the first time that the choreographers all, not only the 
choreographers but the dancers, from the get go of inception, idea, concepts, 
to the storyline, to choreography, to, you know, like everything was 100 
percent collaborative. Because of that, it takes longer. It's a 
little more 
painful of a 
process, but we were all.... The buy-in from the company was 
what the biggest difference, I 
feel like, was, that it felt like it was owned 
equally by every single person. We work collectively now. The film, you 
know, it had seventy-one dancers, but it also had, I 
think, twelve 
choreographers. I 
think the idea of, this collective idea of, not just few is in 
charge but the group can be in charge is the way of the future. I 
really do. I 
think organizations that don't buy into that are not going to be around much 
longer. 
What other solo or company works are you involved with right now? 
So we just finished the virtual RACEy Show. So the RACEy Show is a 
show that I 
created that it's a 
little more racy, and it was a 
show that I 
created from when we.... When I 
lived in LA, we would, my friends and I, 
would get together and dance just for fun, and usually the clubs were the 
only outlets that we had to do that. There was something about it that was 
17 
very freeing as a 
professional dancer to just get together with friends and 
dance and put a 
show on, but also the this idea of American virtuosity or.... 
What's the word I'm looking for? We're so bashful and shy sometimes here, 
and it just doesn't make sense to me. As a 
Korean woman who was grown 
up to be very timid and, you know, not embrace my body and not embrace 
my sexuality, it was really important to me to be able to express that here in 
Oklahoma because I 
felt like it was missing. We had this other personality, 
and we would just put on the show. It was wildly popular. This is the first 
year we weren't able to do it, either, and so we said, "Let's do it virtually." 
One of my friends happened to have the old KSBI soundstage, and so we 
rented some lights, put some lights up. I 
actually did the lighting for 
everything. We threw together twelve pieces in two weeks. 
Little Thunder 
Cha Poos 
Little Thunder 
Cha Poos 
[00:50:07] 
My goodness! 
We filmed it, and then we just.... It's actually live right now. I'll send you a 
link to it. 
That would he great. 
That's one project, and then I 
have two projects for school. One is a 
number ... two companies dealing with the idea of, it's actually called 
orthorexia. It's a 
kind of pre-anorexia that has to do with virtual, you know, 
Instagram and Facebook influencers and the effect that it's having on young 
adolescent women. Actually turned it into a 
study, and they created a 
survey, surveying all the women in their lives from three different age 
groups that have to do with body image. I 
wanted to do it because, you 
know, it's such a 
taboo subject, but it's also one that if we don't start talking 
about it, it's going to be a 
problem. It's a 
huge problem in areas already and 
dancers who tend to be in the mirror all day looking at their bodies. We need 
to address it. I'm very careful about the way that we do it, but it's also one 
that I'm seeing that they are, from the first day to now already, they're a 
little more brave about talking about it. They're really surprised at the 
answers that they get from their friends. I 
think it's going to be one of those 
transformative experiences. The dance I 
choreographed to is a 
Peter Gabriel 
song called "My Body is a 
Cage." I'm working with a 
costumer at UCO. 
She actually created a 
corset to represent the ideals that we have. I'm to the 
last section which, right now, they've just taken off the corset, and they've 
got it up here. Then we'll dance with it and then throw it off and all of that. 
It's very free, I 
feel like. In this time in their lives when they're shaping their 
ideas and going into the world as young adults, it feels good to me that I'm 
going to send some people out there who are a 
little more secure in 
themselves because of this experience. 
18 
Little Thunder 
That sounds great. How big a 
part cf your research is music? How much 
time do you spend on music research? 
Cha Poos 
Little Thunder

Cha Poos 
[00:52:26] 
Little Thunder 
Cha Poos 
It depends on the project. Sometimes I 
start with the music, and sometimes I 
find the music to fit the project. The last project I 
worked on with the same 
company was an original work by Patrick Conlon and his wife Christina 
[Giacona], and they actually came to me. It was a 
work called Cube (f 
Light. 
They came, and we have always wanted to collaborate. It started with the 
music, and we choreographed everything to the music. It was eight different 
choreographers, so it was really neat to see all of it come together. The 
concept somehow wove perfectly through. Then sometimes I'll have a 
concept, and then the music just finds me somehow, always. Did a 
number 
for Kaleidoscope, the other company at school. I'm actually doing a 
number 
called "Solid Gold Meets 1999." Do you remember Solid Gold? 
Yes. (Laughs) 
Okay, that's, like, my time growing up. I 
watched Solid Gold religiously 
every Saturday for, I 
think it was only around for eight years or something. I 
don't know how I 
found it. I 
was in a 
rabbit hole one night and just went 
with Solid Gold. I 
was thinking, "Many of these kids don't know what's 
Solid Gold is anymore. It could be interesting. What would it look like if it 
stayed around and we were still doing that every Saturday?" What I've done 
is, the costumer is going to keep the costuming ' 80s, but I'm using the top 
ten songs from 1999. We're talking about "Livin' la Vida Loca," to Britney 
Spears "Oops! ... I 
Did It Again." (Laughter) It's kind of neat because we get 
to revisit that time, and a 
lot of the seniors that are graduating this year were 
born in 1999. 
That's pei fect. (Laughs) 
In that way, I'm finding the music, you know, because it's definitely driving 
the piece because it's going to be thirty seconds of every song, just like the 
show "Solid Gold." It's always fun. 
What a 
great concept. Well, you have some early memories cf your 
grandmother pei forming. Can you talk about the historical basis (f 
her 
"Arirang, " I 
think. I 
never say it right, I 
know. 
No, that was great! There's a 
traditional dance in Korea, and the different 
regions, I 
think, have different, even different sounding, "Arirang." The 
basic concept of it is that there's a 
sadness and a 
desperation, I 
think, to the 
music. My grandmother, I 
just remember she would sing it, and I 
remember 
she would dance to it. It was real slow and melodic, and the movement was 
19 
very lyrical. I 
just remember thinking that was one of the most beautiful 
things as a 
child, that of my memories of her, was that she would.... She 
was always a 
little bit silly because they would drink... and gamble and play 
those little plastic-card games. I 
don't remember what that's called. I 
just 
remember that. Like I 
said, when I 
went back to Seoul, I 
was really inspired 
by this last trip. When I 
came back, I 
choreographed a 
number to a 
couple of 
revisions of that song, of that music, and I 
set on a 
group of dancers for 
Oklahoma Contemporary Dance Festival here. It was very therapeutic for 
me. It was like a 
releasing of my expectation of who I 
thought I 
needed to 
be. 
Little Thunder 
And based on the historical separation cfNorth Korea and South Korea, as 
I 
understand. 
Cha Poos 
[00:56:08] 
Little Thunder 
Yeah, and I 
think, I'm pretty sure that in the next couple of years, the last 
people who were originally separated will be passing. I 
think that it's a 
significant time. I 
actually did a 
dance a 
few more, I 
think, maybe three or 
four years ago. I 
did a 
dance called "The Meeting." Not a 
lot of people know 
about this, but I 
think about five years ago they started allowing North 
Korea and South Korea, about a 
hundred people, to come into this place in 
the middle and meet. The way that they would choose people, North 
Koreans would be like whoever was more loyal to the government, and 
South Korea would be lottery. They would find these hundred families, and 
they would collect at this meeting. It was always this video of a 
table and the 
members of the family meeting around. They had these people above them 
that would be watching to make sure that they weren't saying anything bad 
and to make sure that the gifts were allowed. There were certain parameters 
of gifting that you could give each other. These are people that haven't seen 
each other in sixty years. I 
did choreography for it, and I 
used a 
black table 
to represent that the table. I 
had, you know, people dressed as South and 
North. It was, as well, very therapeutic for me, as well. The conceptI think 
that show is called Home. The concept for me was, you know, they weren't 
together physically, but when they came to this meeting, they just, like 
senior citizens turned into six-, seven-year-olds who just wanted to be with 
their brother. They were home. That was my concept for that. 
Oh, my goodness, it sounds like a 
wonderful piece. Well, in addition to your 
dance work, you're raising your children, although they're getting a 
little 
bit older now. You have a 
daughter and a 
son, and you do think a 
lot about 
both the kinds c 
f 
knowledge that were passed from women to women and 
sort cf the gender expectations from generation to generation. How do you 
handle that with your own daughter? What it forms your.... 
20 
Cha Poos 
Little Thunder 
Cha Poos 
[01:00:21] 
I 
think I 
had a 
really—when I 
was pregnant with my daughter, and actually 
for a 
short time after I 
had her, I 
had just these questions of, "Who am I? 
Who am I, and what can I 
pass down? What do L ..." I 
had to take inventory 
of the things that were taught to me or the things that I 
had learned. I'm 
putting this person out in this world. "How do I 
do it and do it honestly, and 
do it in a 
way that makes me feel really good about who's out there?" So 
some of the things that I 
remember from my old upbringing was this idea of 
her owning her body. That sounds like a 
very strange thing to do, but I, for 
the longest time, didn't have that sense because, you know, my mother 
dressed me. She cut my hair. I 
remember for the first time in, like, the fifth 
grade, I 
asked for my bangs or something to be cut. It was just this family 
meeting, and it was just really dramatic. I 
just remember thinking, "It's my 
hair." God bless them, my aunt and my mom are just the most wonderful 
people, but they had no qualms about coming up to me at any point and 
going, "Oh, look at your little boobs," and, you know, just touching me. I 
just remember thinking, "I 
will never do that. It's my body, and how do I 
own it if I 
don't own it?" That was one thing. Then the other thing I 
remember, speaking as a 
woman, that my grandmother and my mom and my 
dad would always, from the time they were in their forties, would be like, 
"Don't have much longer." (Laughter) 
They would say things like, "My 
life was great, and then it was over when I 
had you." Not in a 
bad way, but they were just saying they made choices 
because of their children. I 
just remember thinking that's a 
lot of pressure to 
put on a 
child, that you gave up your life for us. Well intentioned in one 
meeting. My God, I 
wouldn't be who I 
am without any of them, but I 
was 
taking inventory, thinking, "Okay, noted: leave the girl's body alone. Also, 
how can I 
teach her these things without modeling them," which is, I 
think, 
what drives me and pushes me to constantly improve myself, and read, and 
say yes a 
lot of times to projects that scare me, that made me nervous. If I 
don't do those things, then how do I 
expect my children to do them? They 
got to witness me during my lowest point right after the divorce, but also, 
they got to experience me going through graduate school by myself. I 
remember my daughter would learn my note cards with me when I 
was, you 
know, studying for a 
test. She has an incredible vernacular. They both do, 
and I 
think it's because they experienced that journey with me. 
Right. 
They've really gotten the best of both worlds in their father situation and my 
situation. I 
think they're just remarkable children, and I'm not just saying 
that because they're mine. (Laughter)

I 
know they are. Well, is there anything we didn't talk about that you'd like 
to add or.... 
Cha Poos 
I 
don't think so. I'm just extremely grateful for the people in my life who 
have believed in me, from my teachers in, you know, middle to high school, 
to the mentors that I've had at OCC, and then Jamie Jacobson at UCO, 
Cindera Che, who was one of my biggest mentors and still is in life, I 
think 
the younger people who are now working with me in the organization who 
will be taking over. I 
think there's a 
lot of times when we think about what 
we've done, we forget about everybody else who's helped us do what we do. 
As much as this is wonderful and I 
feel very special, I'd be remiss to say 
that I've done it all myself. There's been so much help and so much support 
and so much assistance along the way that, you know, the things that exist 
exist because of everyone else. I 
just get to reap the rewards, which is 
incredible. 
Little Thunder 
And a 
community journey. 
Cha Poos 
Sure, 100 percent. 
Little Thunder 
Well, thank you for your time today, Hui. I 
really appreciate it. 
Cha Poos 
I 
appreciate you. Thanks so much for reaching out. So nice to meet you. 
Little Thunder 
Same here.
