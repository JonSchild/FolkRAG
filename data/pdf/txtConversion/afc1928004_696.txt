Poison Faced Bill. 
A HUMOROUS RECITATION. 
Written and clelivcrecUy Charley Jerome. 
There was a 
man named Poison Faced Bill, 
He swam here from Kalamazoo; 
He 
lked like a 
living skeleton, 
Tha a 
-v mill had cut in two. 
He fought 
-11tri L. Sullivan, 
And he was knock 
-lean to Spain, 
He wrestled ,olar and elo. 
With a 
railroad cattle train. 
Muicabey's German bull dog, 
Made a 
ftee lunch out of his lung. 
They made a 
telegraph wire to Chicago, 
Out of Poison Faced Bill's lung, 
On the top of an iron picket fence, 
lie used to sic p 
at night. 
He got tied to the tail of a 
kicking mule, 
But still be came out all right. 
By Charley Jerome, for Chas. A. ',oder,

A

She works at painting bretzels,

Her toes are cross the street.

You squeeze my little hand,

My Dainty Leonora. 
By D. F. Morton. 
Sung by Master Dunn, 
The sweet June roses were in bloom, 
The air was perfume laden, 
And while wandering where the daisies bloom, 
I 
met a 
charming little maiden. 
She had the fairest face and sweetest smile, 
I 
e'er had seen before her, 
No city belle looked half as well, 
As my dainty Leonora. 
CHORUS. 
Around the dimples on her chin, 
A 
smile was sweetly playing. 
(Break and Dance.) 
The zephyrs through her golden curls 
That summer day were straying. 
(Break and Dance.) 
With love for her my heart was filled, 
I 
really did adore her, 
I'll ne'er forget the day I 
met 
My dainty Leonora. - 
We wandered where the lilacs hr ,. 
inging, 
And the birds sweet somoi ce 
The music of her soft sing.

Still in my ears ;,0

As I

The Wonderful Star. 
Written by CHARLES JEROME, and sun; with great success In tho oetied 
musical sketch, " Comedy." 
I 
am an actor, you see, and you will agree 
That I 
am a 
wonderful star; 
My appearance is fine, they say I'm divine, 
And I'm sought after near and far. 
The managers say that I'll have my day, 
They can't tell how far off it may be; 
They know very well, but they don't like to tell, 
I'm the finest they ever did see. 
CHORUS. 
So don't you forget that I'll show them pet 
That I 
am away above par; 
And I'm sure you will say, on some future day, 
That I 
am a " wonderful star." 
I've got letters here from managers " queer • 
That have heard of my talent before; 
In their letters they say at night I'm to play, 
And take checks at the gallery door. 
And some want to know if I'll _join a 
show 
Where my salary is paid in advance ; 
To the " props" must attend, and sit on the " end," 
And also do a 
good song and dance. 
So don't you forget. &a. 
But I 
do not fear, the day will be here 
When my name they will often repeat ; 
And I'll show them all that I've got the " gall," 
Count Joannes wih take a 
back seat. 
Dr. Landis, old boy, will no more annoy, 
For he'll have.to pack up and go West ; 
And then you will see that out of the three 
The " wonderful star" is the best. 
So don't you forget, dre.

Come Back to Your Irish Home. 
113 Chas. Dockstader, expressely for Flora Moore and snng 
by her with great success. 
There's a 
garden spot on earth, to me, 
'Tis the sweetest place I've seen; 
Where childhood's happy moments passed--
I 
see it in my dreams. 
But T 
left it, and I 
came to roam, 
'Twas hard to say good-bye; 
Ofttimes I 
fancy I 
can hear 
My poor old mother cry. 
CHORUS. 
Come back, oome back, 
Come back to your Irish home. 
Then come back! come back I 
Come back, Kate, och hone. 
I've been away one year to-day; 
And my heart feels lonely yet; 
Ofttimes they write and seem to fear, 
That I 
will soon forget. 
But I 
can't forget where'er I 
roam, 
No matter how I 
And in my sleet) 1 
seem to hear 
My r

Oh, mourners come and join the band, 
Now my soul am happy. 
March right on to Canaan's land, 
Now my soul am free. 
The angel Gabriel's coming round, 
Now my soul am happy. 
Don't you hear his trumpet sound? 
Now my soul am free. 
CHORUS. 
Then shout on, mourners, now my soul am happy; 
Then shout on, sinners, now my soul am free. 
[REPEAT.] 
The land of Canaan's close at hand, 
Now my soul am happy. 
The Savior he has got command, 
Now my soul am free. 
We'll cross the river on a 
raft, 
Now my soul am happy. 
So jump on board the blessed craft, 
Now my soul am free. 
Then shout on, &c. 
If a 
man is rich or he is poor, 
Now my soul am happy. 
If he don't shout he'll suffer sure, 
Now my soul am free. 
Good St. Peter guards the gates, 
Now my soul am happy. 
If you don't mind you'll be too late, 
Now my soul am free. 
Then shout on, &c. 
BILLY'S REQUEST. 
41; F..7m,s• by Mr. DILLY BIRCH for two years with tremendous au.ceees 
Give my top and string to brother, 
Mamma, when I'm dead; 
When the sexton puts me under, 
In my 1:ttle bed; 
If the job 13 
to throw him, 
When the string he jerks; 
Get some little boy to show him, 
flow the old thing works. 
Repeat last two line& 
Give my chewing- gum to eister, 
I 
don't want it more; 
On my gum -, 
it raised a 
blister, 
They are awful sore; 
Give away my ragged jacket, 
Marnmt, don't you cry; 
In the clouds I'll raise a 
racket, 
In the sweet bye-and-bye. 
Repeat last two lines, 
Tell our neighbors that his billy goat, 
Causing all my rips; - 
When he bounced me, oh, dear mother, 
I 
passed in all my chips, 
Though your son forgives him, mother 
Give him all my wealth; 
Hit him with a 
ripe tomato, 
You know how it is yourself. 
Repeat last two lines 
Looking for Dates. 
Written by CHARLES JEr.051E for his friend EmILE Alma, 
Good morning, Mr. Agent, 
Anything new to•day ? 
Heard from his Nibs in Boston, 
What did he have to say? 
What! says he never heard of us? 
Well, he mast have a 
cheek ; 
We've been together for the last ten years, 
And r-yer lost a 
week. 
Cull we have the finest wardrobe, 
And all our act: are new. 
My partner he can do the flip, 
And I 
can do one, too; 
Our breakneck biz it is immense, 
We're sure to kill them dead; 
My pard he turns a 
double, 
And stands right on his head. 
We also do a 
double clog, 
Or on the end can sit; 
I 
know all the funny gags, 
And my partner does the split. 
We also do an Irish act, 
And I 
can walk a 
rope, 
Do straight biz for a 
stump speech, 
And we furnish our own soap. 
I 
can sing a 
ballad, dance a 
fling, 
Or do the man fish act • 
I 
work in dramas, I'm a 
funny clown. 
I 
can split them up the back. 
So that must be a 
mistake, 
Or the salary is too high; 
You can't be up with cullies 
Who think they are too fly. 
So just drop him another line 
And tell him what we do, 
And if you can't catch a 
hundred, 
Take twenty for the two.

On the Road. 
Written by CHARLES F. JEROME. 
tell you it's no use talking, boys, I'm going to stop right here 
I've had no money for the last three weeks, and the " man-
ager" I 
think is queer ; 
Now, what's the old guy giving us, when he says he's got no 
money ? 
I'm sure the house was good last night, so he needn't get so 
funny. 
Why, the hotel man is kicking, and the board bill's up to-day, 
So if it's not settled by this evening, we'll have to skip away ; 
And the Chinese laundry's got my washing—I've only got one 
collar— 
And he says that he won't give them up, for I 
owe him just 
one dollar. 
So let us go and strike his nibs, and see what we can do, 
Tell him we must have some wealth, and we may catch h 
case or two. 
And if he doesn't give it up, we'll not go on to- night, 
For he cannot do without us, boys, so we have him dead to 
rights ; 
Just tell the song and dance men what we are going to do, 
And tell them not to wash up until they get their money, too , 
And tell that " serio-comic queen " she'd-better write for dates,' 
Or we'll put her up for a 
walking match against her rival--
" 
Kitty Bates." 
Also that snide Dutch actor, he need not be afraid. 
If he gets left upon the road, he can go and learn a 
trade. 
So the best thing, boys, that we can do, is to try and stop this 
" 
beat," 
For he may think, as others do, that actors never eat ; 
And I 
know that I 
eat regular— that is, when I'm at home, 
And when I 
strike that good old spot, I 
never more will roam.

The Masher. 
Written by CHARLES JEROME. 
Who is it that we meet each day 
On the Bowery, or Broadway, 
That dresses in a 
style so gay ?* 
The Mashei 
Who is it that is on the mash, 
In his pockets you will find no cash, 
And he often goes without his hash ? 
The Masher. 
'Who smiles upon the girls so sweet 
Whenever he meets them on the street, 
And his washerwoman he is sure to beat ? 
The Masher. 
Who is it knows the free lunch route, 
Where he eats his fill and then gets out, 
And says high living gives him the gout ? 
The Masher. 
Who is it that often makes the remark 
He spends hundreds of dollars while out on a 
lark, 
And for the want of a 
bed has to sleep in the Park 7

THE MARBLE ARCH. 
Sung with great success by EDDIE Nonwoon. 
AS I 
strayed beneath a 
marble arch, one evening In July, 
A maiden lair, with golden hair, came gently trlpping by: 
The lustre ol her diamond eyes, shone on me like a 
torch, 
And in a 
whisper soft she said, is this the marble arch? 
CHORUS. 
Then round her lovely form I 
drew my magic circle, 
I 
pressed her, I 
caressed her, my brain was in a 
whirl, 
Around hcr lovlly tom I 
drew my magic circle, 
I 
kissed her and I 
called her a 
very pretty girl. 
. I 
took Per to e 
shady spot beneath the spreading trees, 
I 
took liold ofTher lily•white hand, and fell down on may knees; 
Beloved, cried 1, arise, said she, and before I 
had time to speak 
no imprinted a 
one burning 1:1143 upon my blooming cheek. 
Then round her lovely form, & c. 
Good- night, says she, hi a 
voice so sweet, and gently squeezed 
my hand, 
My knees began to knock and shake, for I 
2,ould scarcely static:: 
We'll meet again some other nLtht, 
nd then prepare to march, 
But where, cried I, she then replied, beneath that marble arch, 
Then round her lovely torm, ttc. 
However, since that fuel night, I 
have not seen myqueen, 
But I've heard them say she's run away with a big fat horse 
marine; 
A 
ring I 
give her when we meet, but not as you suppose, 
never put it on her halal, I'll stick it through her nose. 
Then round her lovely form, S:e.

AS 
sung by SITERraiN 4C,..; MACK. 
What should make thee at, my darling. 
Pork and boa: is and mutton stew, 
Ham and veal, and roasted turkey. 
Hearts and livers, kidneys too. 
Sour krout, sausages, tlnd limburg,, 
Eggs and oysters, bread and crust 
if you do not quit your gorging. 
Ds.rling, you will surely bust. 
Beets and turnips you devour, _ove, 
Sweet potatoes take your eye, 
Cucumbers. cabbages and .tring,-1n-atts, 
- Heavy on your stomach lie ; 
Quail on toast and prairie chicken, 
Taste so 1
,, vely, so you say ; 
I 
should think so, for you eat, love, 
Sixteen good squero meals a 
day. 
Pickled eels .feet, stewed canaries, 
Pigs feet I 
Toiled in kerosene, 
Elephants stuffed wi di sarsaparilla, 
Donkeys' cars with pork and beans, 
Beeswax fried in black molasses, 
Oysters stuffed with , 1retie whales, 
Or frogs in glue prepared in fine cut, 
Hoopskir; s

.some people have peculiar ways, and I 
have some, I 
know, 
I 
don't like swell society, restraint I 
cannot go ; 
I've done and will do as f 
please, keop still or make a 
noise, 
I 
love to please tile ladies, but prefer to please the boys. 
SPOKEN.—Oh, well, ladies never appear perfect in each 
other's eyes ; there's always some little fault, whether caused 
by envy, jealousy, or otherwise. 
So, on this occasion I 
waive 
female opinion and intend— 
CHORUS. 
Just to please the boys, 
Just to please the boys ; 
I 
always meant, with good intent, 
To try and please the boys. 
I 
love to sing, to sail, and race, I 
love to skate and dance, 
And love all social parties where they give a 
girl a 
chance ; 
M V lady friends find fault because they cannot share my joys, 
And tell me I'm too forward when I 
try to please the boys. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, whenever I 
try to entertain a 
gentleman, I 
hear such exclamations as these : " Ain't she awful?" " How 
exceedingly fresh !" " She will never catch a 
sensible hus-
band." 
And all this because I 
try— 
Just to please the boys, & c. 
Some people call me fickle, just because I 
change my beau, 
And don't keep one man to myself, and let all others go ; 
Now that, I 
think, would be unkind, for no one more enjoys 
To give good-looking men a 
chance, and try and please the 
boys. 
SPOKEN.—Lord ! 
I'm not fickle. 
I 
do like one man. The 
other evening a 
gentleman kissed me just because I 
let him. 
He repeated the act, and then wanted an encore. 
I 
refused. 
He said, " Ella, they all do it." 
He didn't mean me. I 
have 
a 
few kisses left, and when I 
distribute them it will be— , 
Just to please the boys, 8tr-

Must we then meet as strangers, 
After cur dreams of jay? 
Oh! must the love we plighted 
One bitter word destroy ? 
Life without thee were lone1y/ 
Thou art my spirit's sigh ; 
Bid not affection's roses 
Wither and fade and die. 
0 must the love we plighted 
One heedless word destroy? 
Must we then meet as strangen, 
After our dreams of joy ? 
Can we then meet as strangers, 
When we recall the past ? 
Will not its beauteous vision 
Deathless in mem'ry last ? 
Give me the smiles of gladness 
Once I 
could fondly claim : 
Whisper with sweet affection,— 
Whisper that once loved name:

Oh since that time I've always found you've been a

Whatever I

If ever I

Parody on Leaving the Old Folks. 
Written by BILLY LESTER, and sung by PAUL ALLEN, ESQ. 
I 
am leaving now the Poor-House, to go I 
know not 
where, 
I 
am leaving it in sorrow and disgust; 
I've eight million in my pocket I 
stole from Viola 
Clifton, 
To try and get a 
date I 
know I 
must; 
I've a 
pocketful of gags and encores I 
bought from 
Sarah Bernhardt, 
I've been a 
tramp for over seven years; 
I 
could start a 
penny rodging house under the Fifth 
Avenue Hotel, 
And let people sleep in the drums of my ears. 
Cuottus: 
Then I 
am leaving now the Poor- House, I 
am trans 
ferred to the Colisetun, 
For trying to guy a 
couple of musical mokes; 
If I 
catch Niles & Evans stealing Eddie Booth's 
Dialect, 
I'll make them a 
present of John T. Kelly's jokes. 
Adam and Eve, From Luna and Bud Granger were 
with a 
fly by night, 
They played to eighty cents in Kankakee; 
They done a 
nice big four act with the Arnold 
Brothers from Texas, 
And statue essence with the J 
called Andy McKee 
Hyde & Behman done a 
waltz-jig along with Billy 
Emmet, 
Poor Paul Alien couldn't dance, his foot was sore; 
But yet he is a 
darling, he is mashed on Charlotte 
Banks,

DANCE ME ON YOUR KNEE. 
Sung with great success by Miss Minnie Lai, 
r 
When I 
was very young how fond I 
was of childiA joys 
I 
loved to play among the girls, but better with the DOyS 
It was pussy in the corner, tag and ineminie, 
And when my ma put me in bed I 
would steel out on tht 
sly. 
I 
dared not make the slightest noise when getting back tr. 
bed, 
The biggest boy would boost me in my window overhead 
I 
would go to sleep and dream I 
was a 
lady young and 
gay, 
And when my ma would take. me up to her I 
used to say: 
CHORUS— 
Dance me on your knee, mother, dance me on your knee 
Clasp your arms around my waist, it -wont hurt me. 
Hold me tight, don't let me fall, I 
won't be afraid at all, 
Dance me, mother, dance me on your knee.

DANCE Mt ON YOUR KNEE.—Concluded. 
But when I 
wore long dresses first the little boys I 
shook 
As my ideas developed the bigger ones I 
took. 
instead of childish games it was parties, social balls and 
drives, 
Where'er I 
went I 
had my favorite escort by my side. 
But when I 
tire of one young man, another soon I 
take, 
For there's a 
way of knowing how to give the boys a 
quiet 
shake. 
And when I 
wish to call one back a 
smile would win the 
day— 
I 
need but look upon his face and coaxingly this say: 
Dance me on your knee, Scc. 
I 
want to find a 
lover that will undertake the task, 
And understand just what I 
want, and never have to ask. 
If s`iich can recommend himself I 
pray don't backward be, 
But be sure you're brave and strong enough to dance me 
on your knee. 
There's many a 
wish a 
young girl has she don't like to 
express, 
There's many a 
time we answer no, and heartily mean 
yes. 
I 
always warn the fellows when we are sitting all alone, 
Be sure don't rumple up my clothes, when you dance me 
on your knee.

In Summer time I 
love to stroll, 
'Mid flowers rich and rare; 
And gather daisies white and gold; 
That blossom here and there; 
Some people love to pass the hours, 
Out on the lake so clear; 
But I 
prefer to gather flowers, 
That grow in fields so near. 
CHORUS: 
Love among the flowers white and gold, (Sym). 
There our happy tales of love unfold; ( Sym). 
Oh, what joy it is to ramble through the wildwood 
With a 
pretty little maiden, young and fair; 
And gather flowers as we did - in childhood, 
To weave them in her braids of golden hair. 
There stands a 
cot not far from here, 
At least it seems to me; 
Where dwells the one I 
love most dear, 
My blue eyed Carrie Lee; 
I 
met her in the flower-decked field, 
One evening clear and calm, 
•I did not wait or hesitate, 
But offered her my arm.

Whose eyes with joy did beam; 
As gently I 
spoke to her 
Of young love's sweetest dream.

Moonlight at Killarney,

He- comes home every night wid his blackguard songs, 
lie said he learned them up at some free and aisy; 
He wanted his mother for to put on the boxing gloves wid him 
lie broke his little brother's leg wid a

He have an old deck of cards, and he wants me to play 
Pedro, Sancho, Seven-up and the Joker. 
He says he's taking

lessons from Professor Johx. 
Donovan,

He goes prancing around all the dances of the city, 
And he have a 
girl who do be dancing at the vulgarities. 
Oh, he pawned me Sunday pants last Week, 
To go and lay a 
wager, 
And he brought me down the street that night, 
For to fight, a 
big black nagur; 
There's his cousin Mike, a 
nice yourig man, 
-Wid the finest kind of manners, 
Night after night they roamed about, 
And they called it carrying the banners. 
But the two of hem got in a 
scrape, 
They stole a 
Dutchman's pony, 
Poor Mike is hi the workhouse now, 
And Bernard's in Aronagonia. 
Oh, he tied a 
can to our dog's tail, 
When we'd gone to church last Sunday, 
He got stiff staving tight, and stayed out that night, 
And he was up before the judge in the morning; 
He have the house turned inside out, 
He's gone to 
bad intirely, 
Be heavens f 
fear that hell be hung, 
God help you. Poniard 
He kicked his sister 
.'onorah in the forehead last week, 
Ile wanted custard pie for his supper; 
And he came home wid liiiisei 
tuf1ud wid boileu oyster stews, 
And threw the corn beef and cabbage in the guttzr.

Oh, I 
came to this country a 
short time ago, 
To better my fortune to find, 
For the old country, sure, is a 
very hard place. 
For any poor hard-working boy. 
But it's little better her -
8, to my sorrow I 
find, 
As I 
search for employment each day, 
And to get it I 
can't; and the reason is this, 
Just because I 
am Irish, they say. 
Cnonrs. 
Jt.st because I 
am Iri3h they would give me no work, 
Just because I 
am Irish they cry, 
But where ever I 
go, in good fortune or woe, 
I 
will still be a 
true Irish boy. 
Aint it bard now,I ask you, that such things should be 
In a 
country where all are free men ? 
What have Irishmen done, now I 
plainly ask you, 
That such slurs should be cast tpon 
In America's troubles in days long ago. 
In the battle fields, fiercest arrayed, 
They did nobly fight for their God and the right, 
"t Just because I 
am Irish," they cry. 
(Chorus.) 
I 
will say little more; I 
don't wish to offend, 
As ray aim it is ever tc please, 
And this world is a 
hard one to the poor,you allknow 
Wit h 
but little comfort and ease, 
There's a 
haven of re- t 
away up in the skies 
That is ever pleasant and fair, 
And God, in his infinite mercy, I 
know, 
Will admit all good Irishmen there,

How to Catch a 
Flea. 
As described by DAN COLLYER. 
Don't be in a 
hurry and get frantic. 
Watch your chances. 
Take a 
two-foot rule and measure the distance from your 
hand to the flea. 
Take your pencil and calculate the time it 
will take to pass your hand that distance, so you may be sure. 
Take a 
long breath. 
Aim to grab his hind leg. 
Nerve your-
self up, take a 
drink, make a 
ferocious grab, and if the flea 
strays off, continue the chase around the room until you 
tumble over the baby; then flee. 
Coolness. 
AT 
the theatre, one night, John Phcenix thought he saw an 
acquaintance sitting a 
few feet in front, and asked the gentle-
man between them to poke him with his cane. 
When he 
turned around John discovered his mistake. 
Fixing his at- , 
tention on the play, and affecting indifference of the whole 
affair, he left the man with the cane to settle the disturbance, 
and he, being wholly without an excuse, there was, of course, 
a 
ludicrous and embarrassing scene, during all of which 
Phcenix was profoundly interested in the play. 
At last the 
man asked, indignantly : " Did you tell me to poke that man 
with my stick ?" " Yes." " And what did you want?" " I 
wanted to see whether you would poke him or not." 
"You LIE !" 
The tone was deep and sincere, 
Yet scarce had the words been spoken 
Ere a 
bludgeon and cranium met and embraced, 
And the Sixth Commandment is broken. 
Go to Sleep thy Little Darling 
Published by permission of COLLINS & BUXTON, Portland, Me. 
Go to sleep, my little darling, 
Rest on mother's loving breast, 
And the c.ngels will protect you 
When within your cradle rest ; 
Far above the starry heavens, 
They are looking down on you, 
So repose, my precious darling, 
Close your tiny eyes of blue. 
CHORUS. 
Go to sleep, my little darling, 
Rest your bead on mother's breas`i, 
And the angels will protect you, 
When within your cradle rest. 
Far a-down the dewy meadow? 
All the daises are asleep, 
And the birdies in the branches 
Also are in slumber deep. 
But in Eden far above us, 
Angel eyes are open wide, 
And you are as safe, my darling, 
1..s if they were at your side. 
Go to sleep &e 
in the early morning, 
r:ling, 
Little robin in the tree 
Will awake yott from your °lumber, 
When tie 6ins his merry glee. 
Then iT. take you to my bosom, 
Till the glimmer en the plain 
Tells us that the sun is shining, 
And the day . as come again. 
Go to sleep &c,

THE TURNPIKE GATE. 
As sung by REYNOLDS & W ALLING. 
I 
am thinking of the day when but a 
little child, 
I 
wandered o'er the meadows to the hill, 
Where the sweet flowers grew and forever growing wild 
And the stream e'er flowed by the mill. 
But the old mill house has gone to decay, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
And the miller he lies sleeping where the gentle breezes 
blow, 
And we played 'neath the Turnpike gate. 
CHORUS. 
For the Turnpike gate is the pride of my heart, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
When she sits beside me now, there's a 
smile upon her 
brow, 
That reminds n.e ot the Turnpike gate. 
4 
And the old school-house has gone to decay, 
Where the schoolmaster heard us recite, 
.And those happy, happy days have faded from our view. 
When our little hearts were filled with deii,ght. 
And when the school was out we would wander to the 
spring, 
Where I 
drew for you pictures on your slate, 
And those happy childhood days they'll come again no 
more, 
When we played on the Turnpike gate.

American liNwtettne-Teliing Card.— This is the old-
est anti most widley known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We have 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arranged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each of these into K for King, Q 
for Queen, 
and K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four mws, and are to he read according to directions. Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. 
The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under 
standing. Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
arc in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

1, > meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a 
way as to be non-committal. 
Many youn7 ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi• 
tint 11', tot) fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the monientou 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything- that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of tais dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrirnonk. Tnis pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their allect ions, which fact makes a 
further explanation un 
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
