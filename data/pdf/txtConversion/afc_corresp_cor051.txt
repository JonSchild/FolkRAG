[Letter from Carita Doggett Corse to Alton C. Morris,
April 25, 1940]
April 25, 1940
Mr. Alton C. Morris Box 44 Chapel Hill, North Carolina
Dear Mr. Morris:
A month ago I conferred with Dr. Spivacke of the Music Division, Library of Congress,
regarding the duplicates of the Florida records promised us. He said that making of the
duplicates had been delayed because they had had difficulty in getting a WPA worker
assigned to this task. However, he said he expected to secure a qualified worker in the
near future and would send us our copies as soon as possible. I will forward a copy of your
letter to Dr. Spivacke and ask him to let you know whether these are available.
I have received a request from Dr. O. H. Hauptman to assign a worker in the Tampa office
of the Writers' Project to collect folklore under his direction. I have agreed to do this and he
will confer with my Tampa supervisor on selection of the worker. We already have a large
amount of unedited material which we will be glad to place at his disposal.
Sincerely yours, Dr. Carita Doggett Corse State Supervisor WPA Writers' Project of Florida
