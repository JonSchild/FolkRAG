CAPITOL THEATRE—CHM 'AND LENA. — Chris and Lena 
will be given for the fourth time this evening. 
Interest-
ing play, and well cast, by the Lucien Barnes' Combina-
tion, Sallie Adams and Jule Keen in the leadifg parts. 
In 
addition, a 
first-class olio with the following stars: Frank 
George, G. A. Hill, Lillie and Minnie La Verde, Peter 
Goshan, Effey Kearns, Ned and Willie Ainsley, and Bella 
La Verde. The Ainsley Burlesque, the " Belles of the 
Kitchen," in which the Volkes shine with so much suc-
cess. 
The burlesque is superior to the original, the fun 
of the piece being quadrupled. 
Best travesty of the year 
and performed with immense spirit. 
Don't fail to see it. 
The La Verdes are excellent in their parts, and too much 
praise cannot be bestowed upon them. 
ST. JAMES THEATRE. — This evening the St. James Co-
mique will re-open as a 
Variety Theatre, under a 
new 
management. and with a 
corps of genuine arLists, among 
whom are Lew Brimmer, the lion banjoist and comme-
dian, Ned Turner, Frankie Turner, Bella La Verde, the 
charming young vocalist, the La Verde children unrivalled 
as character artists, M. O'Frien and Ed. Snow. 
The com-
pany now combines some first class talent, and the man-
agement promise new and good faces every week. 
TEX LA 
Vmums.—Saturday evening next these popular 
child artists take a 
benefit at the St. James Theatre. They 
are very clever artists, iudeed, having very few superiors 
in their line of business, singing and dancing exceedingly 
well. 
Their style is originol, and a 
good house should re.. 
4 
ward them. 
In addition to the La Verdes, a 
host of talent 
will appear, both of professionals and amateurs. 
This 
will be the last and only appearance of the La Verdas in 
his city for some time. 
GRAND emus/J.—The opening of the Grand Centra-
last night for the fall and winter season, was very auspi-
cious. 
The house was crowded, and at 8 
o'clock the sign 
"standing room only" was hung out. 
With two excep-
tions the programme was a 
very pleasing one, and the ef-
forts of the performers were well received by the audience. 
The La Verde children in their specialties were worthy the 
repeated encores they received. 
The California quartette 
were squelched, as they deserved to be. 
Miss Martha 
Wren and James Collins, in their versatile performance, 
" 
A 
Terrible Fix," caused the audience to boil over with 
mirth. 
They have good voices, and rendered selections 
from Ill' Trovatore, Guy Mannering and La Perichole. 
J. Brookhouse Bowler, the tenor, sang finely and was en-
cored several times—but the best singing of the evening 
was by Miss Belle L. E. Verde. 
She is also a 
fine jig dan-
cer. 
The Kine brothers, Franklin brothers, Miss Norah 
Campbell and the miniature second regiment concluded 
the fun of the evening. 
This evening the programme will 
be stronger than even than was last night's. 
GRIND CENTRAL.—The Grand Central was crowded to 
its utmost capacity, last night, notwithstanding the coun-
ter attractions. 
The programme was replete with en-
joyable features. 
Without detraction we may say that the 
most pleasing and attractive features of the entertainment 
were the La Verde sisters, who were severally vigorously 
encored by the delighted audience.

I 
love to promenade Broadway, and see the funny sights, 
To mash the chaps, who wink and smile, is one of my delights; 
I 
dote upon a 
fine mustashe, it may be wrong, you see. 
But then the wearer if he's nice, is just the boy for me. 
CII0.—The dashing, flirting, jolly swell, & c, 
3 I 
love to gallop through the Park, the ribbons in my hand, 
To pass the trotters on the road, is dashing, too, and grand; 
Its nice to have a 
beau along, the girls will all agree, 
And if he's gay, and full of fun, he's just the boy for me. 
Cno.—The dashing, flirting, jolly swell, &c.

I'd like to capture if I 
could, a 
chap to suit my mind, 
He must be handsome, got the stamps, and always good and 
kind; 
So if there's any, out of all the faces, here I 
see, 
Who'd like to take me as I 
stand- 0, he's the boy for me.

A 
swell I

With ilgur.1 Lee and form,

met him at the ball last night, boys,

And by the stars above I

Boy.—Pray don't feel offended at what I 
have said, 
Nor leave me with a 
toss of your pretty little 
head. 
Girl.—Oh! Sir, I 
am not offended, 
But really, is it right 
That you should fall in love 
So deeply, at first sight ? 
[Chorus as before. 
COTTON PODS, 
As sung by the LA 
VERDE Children. 
Down a 
lane near by a 
wood, 
In early childhood's days, 
I 
first saw Nell the village Belle--
The idol of my lay; 
And when evening casts its shades, 
0! what a 
happy Southern sod, 
We wandered forth in hand and hand, 
To pick the cotton pods. 
Down a 
lane near by a 
wood, 
In early childhood's days, 
I 
first saw Nell, the village Belle, 
The idyl of my lay. 
CaoRus. 
Cotton pods, snow white, 
Beaming in starlight! 
Emblem, sweet Nellie,„ of my love for you. 
Out in the wildwood, 
In early childhood, 
When I 
first gave you the heart that was true. 
Long winter months have come and gone, 
The fields are still the same ; 
We wandered to that little spot 
To meet my love again. 
Boy.-0 
I 
here you are, my own sweet love, 
0! come and sit down by my side, 
And answer, darling quickly, do! 
And say you will be my bride. 
Both.—I 
see the love light in your eyes, 
Of when ,de first did meet; 
And now we are happy with our joys, 
In love and kisses sweet.

Music can be 
obtained from them. 
Words by JouN T. 
RUTLEDGE. 
They say I'm the leader of fashion, 
That no one with me can compare ; 
You can tell by the style that I 
dress in, 
If you meet me, wherever you are; 
The ladies all smile on me sweetly, 
A 
thing that I 
most dearly love; 
You can hear them remark as they meet me, 
lie's a 
nobby young fellow, by Jove! 
CHORUS.

The dear little fel!ow I 
love ; 
The ladies all say as they meet me, 
He's a 
nobby young fellow, by Jove! 
I 
am counted sweetest of waltzers, 
At boating they say I'm immense ; 
I 
bet on the favorite horses, 
I 
am gifted with lots of good sense; 
I 
move in the bon- ton society, 
I'm counted a 
lucky young cove; 
its a 
saying wherever I 
wander, 
He's a 
nobby young fellow, by Jove! 
Yes, he's a 
nobby, &c. 
I 
go to the watering places, 
To live through the hot weather spell; 
Make love to the sweetest of faces, 
A 
pastime I 
like mighty well; 
My lot in this life is a 
nice one, 
in fact it has long been the case ; 
I 
have really more fun than the next one. 
Don't you wish you could step in my place ? 
Yes, he's a 
nobby, &c.

And hope you are the same;

So nice and neat—we dance to ev'ry measure. 
Girl.—For he is called so gay and sweet.

MAN OF WEALTH; 
• As sung by the Le '
S
TEED Children. 
.73ov.—Oh ! man of wealth and cruel hearted, 
Revelling in your plentious store; 
Humanity is sure departed 
From your heart and from your door; 
The bitter winds in vain plead for me, 
What to do or where to go! 
Oh Uncle, save my little Sister, 
Or she will die out in the cold. 
! 
Brother, dear, don't weep, I 
pray thee, 
For the day may yet be bright; 
Or if we die we shall be Angels, 
Living in you land of light; 
And as for him, our wicked Uncle, 
He shall reap as he shall sow; 
For he has left his Brother's children 
Starving, here, out in the snow. 
WE'LL GO WITH THEE. 
As sung by the Li VERD CHILDREN. 
Both Sing.—Though humble my station, 
And rough is my speech; 
To the wealthy and proud 
Oft a 
lesson I'll teach ; 
And in Charity proffer 
The hand when I 
can. 
'Tis the heart, not the pocket, 
Is what makes the man.

Fol de rol, & c. 
I 
finished the dumplins and wanted to go, 
She looked in my face, I 
felt rather blue ; 
Says she Joe, why don't you squeeze me, 
Like a 
lover that's true— 
Egad, says a 
lass, I 
don't care if I 
do. 
Fol de rol, &c. 
Now married we are, and happy we be— 
But we ain't got no babbies to bless her and me ; 
Says she, Joe, you may wait awhile, 
We might have a

THE BELLE OF THE AVENUE. 
Words and Music by JOSEPH P. 
SEMLLY 
Sung by the 
LA 
VERD SISTERS. 
F... II . 
H ARDING Music Pub., 299 Bowery, N. Y. 
Price 10 cents. 
My love is the belle of the Avenue, 
She walks up and down ev'ry day; 
And charms ev'ry one as she passes by, 
So beautiful, graceful and gay; 
The swells, when they sea her, go crazy ; 
And silently wish they were free 
To walk by her side, but they are denied, 
For she will have no one but me. (Oh 1) 
CHORUS. 
She is the belle of the Avenue, 
Graceful and bright, full of fairy light, 
Sweet and enchanting with eyes of blue, 
Beaming with love and glee; 
She is the star of society. 
Pride of the ball with her fairy form. 
Joy and delight of her home so bright, 
And dearer than life to me. 
Sometimes, when it's fine in the afternoon, 
Her ma sends her out for a 
walk; 
" 
Now, darling," she'll say, " don't be long away, 
Don't stand with the vonng men to talk ;" 
" 
0, ma 1" sin replies, 
do not fear me— 
You know such a 
thing cannot be ;" 
Then smiling she goes in all her nice clothes, 
And waits on the corner for me. ( Ha! ha!) 
She is the belle, etc. 
We walk and we talk of the latest balls, 
And view all the styles of the day; 
And when she must leave, oh you can't conceive 
How much I 
would wish her to stay; 
But she will return on the morrow, 
That is, if mamma will agree; 
And while we're apart, I 
know in my heart, 
she's all the time wishing for me. (Ah!) 
She is the belle, etc.

Never Prove False To a 
Friend. 
4irritten by CLA17DE DE 
Hive, Sung with great applause 
by Tor PASTOR, America's Own Comic Vocalist. 
Never prove false to a 
friend, 
In love and in friendship be true; 
Never prove false to a 
friend, 
So long as he's faithful to you. 
Be may be dishonest—a 
knave— 
In other's opinion—but then 
To you he is generous and kind, 
And one of the noblest of men. 
Cuouus.—Never prove false, drc. 
Is any man free from each fault, 
All righteous and good in his ways ? 
Lives there a 
woman on earth, 
That she can be named but in praise ? 
Never speak ill of a 
friend, 
To gossipers keep closed your ear ; 
An excellent rule, in the main, 
Is to credit one-tenth what you hear. 
C011138. --Never speak, lee. 
Stand by a 
man in distress, 
When you know he is really in need; 
Altho' by misfortune he falls, 
There's honor for yon in the deed; 
That one may deceive you 'tis true, 
Then his, and not yours. the disgrace; 
Because we find one man untrue, „ 
Should we wrong and distrust a 
whole race? 
CHOMTE3.—Never prove false, &c. 
Censure a 
man for his faults, 
Give him honor where honor is duet; 
But never prove false to a 
friend, 
So long as he's faithful to you. 
But should you prove false to a 
friend, 
And think he's unendeful to you, 
When the journey of life's at an end. 
You'll find he's superior to you. 
DRIFTING. 
Written by CLAUDE DE 
HAVEN. 
Sung by Miss Nnu.rz 
PERM, the great Operatic Soprano. 
Drifting along, this human barque, 
Freighted with manhood, love and woe; 
Drifting along, with shadows dark, 
Our Pilot and Captain the deadliest foe. 
Drifting along with the waving corn, 
The ripened harvest and new mown hay; 
Drifting along, with the setting Sun, 
From early morn ' till close of day. 
Drifting along, with a 
weary life, 
. 
Encouraged by phantasy—never.there; 
Drifting along, with care and strife, 
To build our Castles in the air; 
Drifting along, from our childhood's home, 
From the cheery glow of a 
Mother's love; 
Drifting along, contented to roam, 
Painting pen pictures, as onward we move. 
Drilling, along, on the treacherous sand, 
By the shadowy beach that meets the wave; 
Drifting along, to that distant land, 
For the tide of life mankind to save ; 
Drifting along, with sin and remorse, 
A 
saddened heart and prostrate form; 
Drifting along, a 
stiffened corsa, 
We are drifting to Him who shelters from harm.

Up at dawn and out ' till after dark 
Merry, jolly as darkies will be, 
You've never, never seen so gay a

I 
flatter myself I

So what do you think of my hat. 
CHORUS. 
I'm the swell with the Alpine hat, 
The swell with the Alpine hat; 
In the street or the park, observers remark 
The swell with the Alpine hat. 
I've a 
rare swarm of base imitators, 
Who try to outdo me, that's flat. 
You must know now that I 
was the first 
To introduce this kind of hat. 
I 
saw it while crossing the Alps, 
In Boulogne too, the swells cut it fat; 
With this kind of castor, and so 
I 
brought over the new Alpine hat. 
I'm the swell with the, etc. 
Some say I 
look like 
Tell,' 
Others think me a ' Merry Swiss Boy,' 
A 
retired organ-grinder one said I 
was, 
Which of course a 
chap's feelings annoy; 
Now I'm neither the one, nor the other, 
I'm a 
native of Hoxton, that's flat, 
But it gives one a 
foreign appearance— 
This new style of Alpine hat. 
I'm the swell with the, etc. 
It has such an effect on the ladies, 
At me now the darlings do stare; 
Imitation they say, is but flattery 
So the same kind of hat nk,w tlley wear, 
I'm engaged to be wed to an angel, 
Who's possess'd of some coin and all that 
She confessed that she could not withstand me,

BE, 
WHILE walking out one evening, 
The sun had gone to rest, 
The little stars were peeping, 
And the birds were in their nests; 
A 
pretty form beside me 
And a 
tiny hand in mine, 
The ,sweetest words were whispered 
When I 
ask'd if she be mine. 
CHORUS. 
She's a 
beauty, she's divine! 
She's promised that she will be mine, 
Yes soon she'll be my little wife, 
This eve we'll fix the time, 
The joy I 
felt I 
can't express, 
Since she promised she'd be mine. 
SHE. 
I 
pr: mised that I 
would be here

For they know I

Whether strolling in the park or on the highway 
In the parlor, at the Opera, the play 
Whether riding, driving, sailing, dancing, singing, 
I'm the jolliest, the gayest of the gay. 
There's none like me, how could there be? 
So gay and free, so full of glee? 
They call me sweet; and well I 
think they may, 
They say I

RIDING in a 
street car the other day, 
Reading in the Herald to pass the time away, 
A 
darlilL, little creature dressed in latest style, 
Took the seat I 
offered her, and thanked me with a 
smile, 
Eyes of brightest lustre, hair of glossy hue, 
Form so fair and slender, and so graceful too; 
How my heart went pit pat, I 
shall ne'ver forget, 
And the dear emotion lingers with me yet. 
CHORUS. 
It was riding in the street car just the other day 
Some one that I 
sw there stole my heart away 
Handsome form and feature just the one for me 
And if our love is e 
utual,happy we shall be. 
She's the charming fair one coming down the street, 
I 
wonder if she'll know me when we chance to meet, 
How my heart is throbbing, tho' I 
must appear 
As if chance alone had made me linger here. 
Oh there's the charming fellow that stole my heart away, 
That gave me up his seat in the car the other day; 
How I 
wish he'd ask me for to take a 
walk, 
it would be enchanting could I 
hear him talk. 
It was riding, etc. 
Darling little creature, pardon me, I 
pray, 
But won't you go a 
walking to pass the time away, 
Well, really sir, I 
thank you, I 
can hardly choose, 
Still you're so engaging I 
will not refuse. 
Won't it be so pleasant just to have a 
walk, 
Yes, and so delightful just to have a 
talk; 
I've a 
little secret to whisper in your ear, 
I'll agree to treasure ev'ry word I

WHERE are the friends that once gathered around me? 
Where is my wife and my children so dear? 
Vanished is all that once made life so happy, 
All that remains now is cheerless and di as, 
Sad is my life— lonely am I. 
Far from the loved spot that once was my home 
Never, Ali ! never again shall I

LONELY I 
wander, in sadness and pain, 
Longing to look on my dear ones again; 
Clouds of misfortune are over me cast, 
Sadly I 
weep when I 
think of the past! 
No glances of pity or kindness I 
see, 
None seem to care for my sorrow or me; 
Lost in the whirl of the city I 
roam. 
Friendless, forsaken, I'm far, far from home. 
CHORUS. 
Honseless and weary, I'm plodding my way, 
Lost among strangers, from day unto day, 
No place of shelter 'neath you cheerless dome, 
Friendless, forsaken, rm far, far from home. 
Once I 
was happy, and loved ones were near, 
Friends and companions were gentle and dear! 
Still I 
remember my mother's delight, 
Clasp'd in her arms while she bade me " good night. 
Cold are the faces that now pass me by, 
What is there left for me now but to die ? 
Lost in the whirl of the city I 
roam, 
Hopeless and helpless, I'm far, far from home. 
Houseless and weary, & c. 
Bright are the homes that I 
see on each side, 
Mansions f 
wealth, and of love and of pride; 
Once I'd a 
home just as bright and as fair, 
Loved ones and dear ones to welcome me there! 
Father of all, in thy pi y 
look down, 
Help me, tho' darkly the tempest may frown; 
Watch o'er my footsteps while sadly I 
roam, 
Save thy poor wand'rer, so far, far from home.

THE LITTLE ISLE SO GREEN. 
Written, Composed and Sung, by CHARLEY RUDDY. 
Dedicated to his friend JOHNNY RoAcn. 
There's a 
land across the ocean, that dear old country, 
Where all those Irish heroes were born, who fought and bled 
While fighting side by side, for to try and save 
That little Isle so green ; 
The land it is oppressed—by the English is distress'd, 
They tried to trample on that flag so green, 
But they never can do that, while there beats an Irish heart 
In the men that lived in that little Isle so green. 
In Ireland, to this day, you will hear the people say, 
They never will own allegiance to the Queen, but for liberty 
They cry, and they would surely die, for to try and save 
That little Isle so green. 
In every little village in that laud so far away, 
You will find that little Shamrock so green, 
For they cannot transport that, as they did unto poor Pat, 
And banish it from that little Isle so green. 
There was a 
noble man not many years ago, 
In Tipperary always to be seen, 
He rendered great his fame, for John Mitchell's a 
true son 
Of that little Isle so green, 
The English soon did know him they must o'erthrow, 
Or else they'd lose that little Isle so green. 
So him they did transport, to a 
strange land sent bim, 
And banished him from that little Isle so green.

Through eating pickled salmon 
Before I 
went to bed, 
A 
flight of wildest fancies 
Went booming thro' my head! 
The world seem'd topsy turvy, 
And people of renown, 
Were doing the most outrageous things! 
When the world turned upside down ! 
The Pope was dressed as Harlequin, 
And danced a 
Highland Fling; 
Queen Victoria came from England, 
A 
comic song to sin:- ; 
Old Barnum acted Hamlet, 
And Booth was playing clown, 
And Bismark war an acrobat 
When the world turned upside down. 
Jay Gould he was a 
Quaker, 
And " bossed" a pelling match; 
Vanderbilt had a 
railway scheme 
He could'nt somehow hatch; 
Mr. Tilton was an Emperor. 
And wore a 
golden crown, 
And Beecher danced the can-can 
Vhen the '7,-orlL turned ar)side dewrs, 
Brigham Young was a 
batchelor 
Who wished a 
wife to win ; 
John Gough opened a " Sample room." 
And served out beer and gin; 
Old Tweed was at his Island home, 
Dressed in a 
suit of brown; 
Ben Butler had joined the Shakers 
When the world turned upside down. 
The shining Truth gleamed o'er the lar4 
And Virtue—more or less ;— 
And womankind gave no more 
Thought to vanity or dress; 
All hu3bands were like angels, 
Wives never wore a 
frown, 
And U. S. Grant said, " No Third Tern* 
Or the States are upside down." 
Brooklyn had changed into a 
sort 
Of Paradise on earth ; 
For it had some trials, 
And one heard no ribald.

HAVEN. 
Bright was the morn when he bade me " Good Bye 1% 
Sad was the heart, with affection's fond sigh; 
Clasped was my form, in a 
lover's embrace, 
Cheered by the smile of a 
tear bedimmed face. 
" 
My ship sails to-night, with the sun in the West, 
I'll be far out at sea, when you are at rest; 
But Maud in your dreams fondly think of poor me, 
And pray for my safety across the blue sea." 
Morn came in its glory, its sun and its flowers, 
Reflecting the contrast of sad weary hours 
Passed in the darkness, the night and the gloom, 
When Richard, my lover, had left me at home. 
Days and weeks slowly passed, but no tidings of thee; 
No news of the ship—had she foundered at sea ? 
Was she wrecked on the main, and sunken the crew? 
And my Richard on board, is there no one who knows? 
Our letters arrived by the day Express line— 
No wreck on the road for the trains were on time; 
From Cousins and Aunts the post mark I 
see, 
But no tidings of Richard—no tidings of thee. 
With a 
sad weary heart I 
walk to the shore 
Whcre Richard and I 
have so oft strolled before; 
And ask of the waves that ran to the sea, 
To tell me of Richard, my darling, of thee. 
The waves had receded, the tide had gone out, 
There I 
stood on the sand with the sea-bird's shrill shoat, 
To remind me of sorrow, of darkness and gloom, 
When Richard, my lover, had left me at home. 
I 
read in the papers—(for it's all that I've heard)— 
"Lost at Sea," was the Martha, on June 23d, 
In mid ocean was wrecked, from a 
high wind at see; 
This only the tidings, the tidings of thee. 
Long weary hours since June, in my home; 
Have I 
pray'd, watch'd a:al waited, for Richard to cone;. 
But something reminds me that never can be, 
For my sad heart is buried with Richard at Sea,

I 
courted a 
girl once, so bashful and shy, 
A 
fair little creature who by the by, 
At coaxing and wheedling had such a 
nice way; 
Ev'ry night to her house I 
went, 
In harmless delight our evenings were spent, 
She had a 
queer saying, whatever it meant, 
For whenever I 
entered her house she would say 
CHORUS. 
Pull down the blind, pull down the blind, 
Pull down the blind, love, come don't be unkind, 
Though we're alone, bear this in mind, 
Somebody's looking, love, pull down the blind. 
How loving we were, how cosy we'd chat, 
'Bout one thing and Vother, and this thing and that, 
With my arm round her waist, how cosy we sat, 
Like two little turtle-doves perched on a 
tree; 
Such squeezing and teasing and pleasing we had— 
Such wooing and cooing to make our hearts glad, 
With laughing and chaffing I 
near drove her mad; 
But still she was awfully spooney on me. 
SPOKEN.—And if that soldier would only have left us alone,. 
She would never have exclaimed; 
Pull down the blind, etc. 
49 
One night, for a 
change, we went to the play, 
A.nd when we got home she was awfully gay, 
She saw them make love, and so learned the way, 
The piece was " Claude Melnotte," and suited her fine; 
She called me her rose- bud, her duck, and her dear, 
She threw her arms round me, while fast fell each tear; 
She cried, oh, don't leave me, for sadly I 
fear 
You don't love me truly, say, will you be mine? 
SPOKEN, — Just at that moment a 
policeman passed, and she 
said: 
Pull down the blind, etc. 
Our courting days o'er, at last we were wed, 
I 
oft bless the hour when to church her I 
led, 
I 
now call her Mary, she calls me Ned, 
We're happy and loving, and never know strife; 
We've a 
fine handsome lass, and two noble boys, 
Trouble or sorrow, never us annoys; • 
Of life we've the sweets, and while tasting its joys, 
I'm thankful I'm blessed with a 
good little wife. 
SPOKEN.—And should an angry word rise to my lips, with a 
meek smile on her face she'll exclaim:

AS I 
was walking down the street, the other afternoon, 
Lit my cigar, put on my kids in front of a 
saloon. 
A 
vision floated past my sight, which caused the dust to fly, 
'Twas the prettiest girl I 
ever saw was the girl that took my 
eye. 
CI:tom:Ts, 
She Is so fair, ( BREAK.) 
I 
do declare, (BREAx.) 
I 
feel so queer whenever I'm near, 
That pretty little girl that took my eye. 
IX 
watched her as she crossed the street, my heart was all aflame. 
alio quickly waved her handkerchief, of course I 
did the same. 
In a 
moment I 
was at her side, your pardon, miss, said 
am bold, pray tell me so, but thcn you took my eye. 
She is so fair, &c. 
asked her if she would be mine, as we stood by the door, 
She said she had no objections,Zbut her parents they were poor. 
Bat trifles like that I 
must never mind, to win her I 
must try, 
And if I 
do, ril introduce to you, the girl that took my eye. 
She is so fair, &a.

He thought he'd know his fate, 
And sank upon his knees in quite 
An agonizing state. 
Selina, say you'll have your George, 
And when shall we be wed; 
He longed to hear me give reply, 
And this is what I 
said: 
Mother says I

From then he went to work, indeed, 
He left No stone unturned; 
Until two thousand dollars a 
year, 
At last he'd really earned. 
My mother heard how things had changed. 
And when we met one day, 
I 
seemed so pleased and so at last 
I 
lovingly did say:

PRETTY AS PICTURE. 
As sung by M ACKIll & W ILSON. 
0/1 1 my heart is gone, and I'm forlorn, 
A 
darling face has won me, 
Such a 
lovely girl, with teeth of pearl, 
I 
met down by the brook, 
She is the prettiest, and the wittiest, 
Her smile has quite undone me, 
I'm her only beau, she told me so, 
When first my arm she took, 
She's as pretty as a 
picture, 
And her voice is just the cage, where the little M S 
VA 
singing, 
She's the sweetest, and the neatest, 
She's as pretty as a 
picture all the while. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my heart is gone, and I'm forlorn, 
Her darling face nas won me, 
Such a 
lovely girl, with teeth of pearl, 
An angel without wings. 
When 'twas time to go, we talked so slow, 
The roses scarce could hear us, 
Then my heart in sport, ' twas cupid's ono, 
Like fishes near the shore, 
When I 
loved her so, as I 
turned to go. 
She fondly lingered near me, 
And she dropped her head, and sweetly said, 
I 
wish you au-revoir, 
She's as pretty as a 
picture, 
,And my heart is a 
golden frame, whenever you may :lig - 
her, 
She's a 
fairy blithe and airy, 
k 
noes as pretty as a

Waiting, My Darimg, for Thee.' 
Sung by MISS ADA W HAT. 
I'VE been waiting for more than an hour, love, 
Yes, waiting and Watching for thee, 
While hoping and praying you'd come, love, 
And keep true your promise to me; 
For, you told me you'd meet me this evening, 
And listen to what I've to say— 
For, to speak the plain truth, I 
am certaia 
I 
can't tell you all in a 
day; 
CHORUS. 
By the lilies that float down the river, 
By the cowslips that grow on the lea, 
By the roses that bloom in the forest, 
I'm waiting, my darling for thee, 
I'm waiting, yes, waiting, 
I'm waiting, my darling, for thee; 
I'm waiting, yes, waiting, 
I'm waiting, my darling, for thee. 
'or more than a 
year I 
have waited, 
That promise from you to receive; 
So surely you'll not break your word, love, 
And leave me your absence to grieve. 
So rii watch and I'll wait here still longer, 
In hope of your coming this way, 
When the dim, misty vail of the twilight 
Has shut out the brightness of day.

Now please give me attention 
To what I 
now will say; 
And I'll tell you of the by-words 
Which are used now, every day. 
The young and old both use them, 
But the boys can say them best; 
And the latest one of them all 
Is, " Young Man, Pull Down your Vest." 
CHORUS. 
Now, no matter where you go, 
To North, South, East or West, 
surely hear the latest one, 
Which is, " Pull Down Your Vest." 
The other day, while walking out, 
I 
stopp'd to light my pipe, 
When I 
heard some boys remark, 
The '• Bloat will never Bite ;" 
Then one said to the other, 
Now take and do your best, 
For " Young Fellar you're too Fresh," 
Take and " Pull down your Vest 1" 
Now, no matter. 
• 
Now I've got a 
second Cousin, 
He is tall and rather slim, 
He'll say to me, Old Fellar, 
Don't give me none of your " chin !" 
There's Mary Ann, my eldest daughter— 
The one that I 
love best— 
Since she has learned to " Tra La-La-Lou," 
She says, " Pull down your Vest !" 
Now, no matter, &a. 
Now, I'll bid you's all farewell! 
As I 
must be leaving you; 
And when you come another time, 
sing some more to you; 
And when you hear these by-words, 
You'll surely know the best; 
Then when your friends ask you to treat, 
You must say, " Pull down your Vest !" 
CHORUS. 
Now, no matter where you go, 
To North, South, East or West, 
You'll surely hear the latest one, 
Which is, " Pull Down Your Vest!"

CEOSSIATG ON THE FERRY. 
fluzg by M ISS ALICE HARRISON, at " Tho Tammampe 
Oh ! please don't laugh when I 
relate 
To you a 
story sweet, 
It's all about a 
charming girl, 
That I 
by chance did meet. 
'Twas love at first sight when we met, 
Those lips so red and cherry, 
Oh! what a 
stunning girl it was, 
That I 
met on the Ferry. 
Chorus Wslking through the cabin, 
Passing all the style, 
Smiling on the fair sex, 
Hours to beguile, 
Nothing yet can cheer me, ' 
For I 
can't be merry, 
Since I 
met that little dear, 
Crossing on the Ferry. 
I 
scarcely knew which way to look, 
For she a 
magnet seem'd, 
Electric sparks I 
thought I 
felt, 
So bright her eyes they beam'd, 
For eviry glance was like a 
lance, 
As ir my heart they'd bury, 
Until I 
felt, I 
scarce knew how, 
While crossing on the Ferry. 
Walking through,ik 
Our journey's end at last arrived, 
My heart beat slow and fast, 
While passengers ran here and there 
My love among them passed, 
She turn'd her head and spoke to me, 
in a 
voice so soft and merry, 
saying, " Write a 
note to Station D, 
Sign, Crossing on the Ferry." 
Walking through, 810.

The daintiest darling of all ?

THE DAUGHTER OF CHARLOTTE TEMPLE. 
• • .1.1 ^b. de 
•••• 
No one who has read the touching account of the 
misfortunes of Charlotte Temple, with that absorb-
ing interest which is inseparable from Alm Row-
son's writings, can rest satisfied while denying them-
selves a 
perusal cf the life of Charlotte Temple's 
Daughter, Lucy Ample. 
It is a 
sequel possessed of all the thrilling in-
terest that characterizes'the life of the unfortunate 
mother, while it exemplifies in a 
wonderful manner 
"the visitation of the sine of the parents upon the 
children." 
It depicts sorrows that refine the balm of sym-
pathy, and consolations which those around us 
" 
can neither give nor take away." 
It contrasts in 
living colors the richest fruits of virtue and happi-
ness on the one hand, and the bitter end, blighting 
disappointments and rr,ir resulting from once yield-
ing to the seductive influence of passion. 
It points a 
moral that commends it to the atten-
tion'of all, and is pervaded by an interest that will 
hold the reader in rapt attention to the end.

The New

A 
little book has lately appeared in print at Messrs. Fisher & 
Denison's, 98 Nassau street, called " The Little Flirt." We cannot 
sari that we recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, 
as we think it would only encourage the bad h- bit of "flirting." 
Unfortunately there is enough of it done without any further neces-
sity of explaining"how, when and where to do it,' and this little 
volume would advise and initiate the uncorrupted in practising what 
is commonly called "flirt ing,." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: 
We have lately seen a 
neat little book, bound in moroeco, coPting 
25 cents, called "The Little Flirt," published by Messrs. Fisher & 
Denison, 98 Nassau street. 
It gives information of the mod us oper-
andi of flirting, and of the meaning of every motion of the hand-
kerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As there is nothing at ad objec-
tionable in the volume, and its contents might afford f•ome innocent 
amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recommend it to our 
young lady and gentlemen readers.

THE APPRENTICE, 
OR 
First Book for Mechanics, Machinists& Engineers 
By OLIVER BYRNE. 
12mo., cloth. $ 1.50. 
ENDORSEMENTS OF THE PRESS. 
The highest praise which can be given to this excellent 
elementary work on practical mechanics, consists in the fol-
lowing simple statement of facts; The editor of this journal, 
while teaching natural philosophy and chemistry in the 
Cooper Institute from 1859 to 1864, was in need of a 
text-
book of practical mechanics, adapted to the advanced classes 
who had been trained in mathematics; in his search among 
the many mechanical text- books, there was not one which so 
fully answered his requirements as the above work. 
It was 
therefore adopted and used with perfect satisfaction, and it 
is with pleasure that he receives it now as an old friend from 
the publishers, gives it his most ea-nest recommendation, 
and wishes it in the hands of all who are still in the fog about 
the units of work, calculation of the power of machinery, 
reastance to motion, strain on material, etc.—Manufacturer 
and Builder, July, 1874. 
ijd`he author of this work is well known as an extensive 
wther who has nzade some valuable additions to American 
technical literature, enumerated above in detail. 
The work 
we are now noticing is a 
theoretical treatise on practical me-
chanics, designed to supply a 
recognized deficiency. 
Most 
of the works on mechanics treat the subject in a manner 
which is not available to young men commencing as appren-
tices in shops. 
Any young man with a 
fair knowledge of 
arithmetic may, however, use this work to great advantage ; 
it is not only suitable for a 
text- book, but also as a %yolk 
of reference. 
Most ambitious young men will make them-
selves so familiar with its contents as to be able to refer 
readily to any portion of the book. 
The author has adopted 
a 
new notation to distinguish units of work from other units, 
which is not without value, and might be advantageously 
introduced into more ambitious works. 
The book is well 
printed on good white paper, and bound in stiff cloth covers.
