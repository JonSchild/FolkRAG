P:  It is Thursday April third and we just had our first practice behind Dracut Junior High School.
Charlie Burgess, Mark Burgess, Greg Dooley, Tony Gomes, Lefty, Lefty's brother, myself, I 
think  that is it.  It started about five-thirty and ended about six-thirty, it got dark couldn't play 
too long.  Everybody got up once to bat bating practice.  Then we went around the second time 
and everybody took about five more swings.  Lefty said he was swinging like a rusty gate.  
Everybody was stretching out trying to get loose it was cold, cool.  We thought that we would 
have a few more guys but it went pretty well for the first practice.  We scheduled another practice
next Thursday same time, same place.  Charlie has a meeting tonight with the league, going to 
get the schedules, 22 games and we are going to play twelve teams twice.  At the intersection of 
Pleasant and Lakeview Avenue just making a turn heading up to the Civic Club.  I am going to 
sit down with Greg and Mark Burgess, Greg Dooley, Mark Burgess, Charlie to talk a little bit.  I 
want to talk to Greg about why he came back this year.  [there are a lot of voices in the 
background as he begins the interview]   Everybody said you weren't going to come back this 
year but you are back.  
D:  The reason why?
P:  Yeah, I am just curious why you decided to play.  
D:  This is one reason, socializing.  
P:  Yeah, coming out after.  
D:  Yeah.  When you sit at home it is a long winter out there.  Digging holes, doing nothing.  Just
busting out for spring.  
P:  Michelle said that Patrick wanted to watch you play to.  (D:  Yeah)  Is that a factor?
D:  Yeah, definitely.  
P:  He is old enough?
D:  Oh yeah.  Well, even on the way home from work tonight Erin mentioned when I am going 
to start playing.  So she used to come all the time.  Hi Bob, how are you doing.  But yeah, 
Patrick, well, I took Patrick to a basketball game.  (P:  Really?)  Yeah, to see Brian and those 
guys play and he loved it.  It is all he talks about.  So I know he is going to enjoy it, there is no 
doubt about it.  
P:  This is your fourteenth year?
D:  Fourteen.  Started
P:  Give me a little synopsis.  
D:  Started in seventy-two the year we got out of High School with Jimmy.  The rat pack.  
Started just a  [beer]  team, just a slow pitch.  Second team for the Civic Club.  
P:  Slow pitch then?
D:  Slow pitch, yeah.  It was a slow pitch for the first three of four years I was in a league.  And 
that was in my opinion that was the most fun back then.  The rat pack was the most fun I have 
ever had.  Of course I was a kid then too.  I am no kid any more.  
P:  Who was the, who sponsored that?
D:  Joe Tully.  
P:  Joe Tully, really?  How like, when he was Senator? 
D:  Yeah, because he had a team down in the Greater Lowell League.  
P:  [sentence unclear]
D:  Yeah.  [unclear].  
P:  That is his business.  [sentence unclear]  So that was in seventy-two?
D:  Seventy-two.  
P:  Were you the coach then?
D:  No.  No but Jimmy and I came on.  They were all bar players so we came on and we were 
starters.  Both starters.  And we never did much drinking then.  But they started us.  Wednesday 
nights  [beer]  games and then they would have the regular league.  
P:  Who were some of those guys that were on?
D:  Uh
P:  You were the youngest guys?
D:  Oh yeah.  
P:  Like older guys like Lou  [Sporulski], that type, no?
D:  Most played for the Civic Club.  I was, uh, Phil Green was the one that got us on the team.  
And Tommy  [Lapeane], you know Tommy, his brother, forget his name and this guy George 
Harrison I was telling you about.  
P:  All Dracut guys?
D:  Yeah, every one of them were Dracut guys.  But we had a lot of fun back then.  Then I, uh, 
after switching from team to team then I started coaching the Burgess'.  I couldn't say, I couldn't 
say exactly what year it was but I would say it would have to have been around seventy-six or so.
Because it was when I got married.  And 
P:  [question unclear due to noise in the background]
D:  Originally it was Bradley Pool.  And it was originally the Walbrook.  But I coached eleven 
Burgess'.  Yeah, I had my share of problems.  
P:  [question unclear]
D:  Yeah, basically it was.  
P:  [question unclear]
D:  Yeah, I think Steve Nickols played then.  Uh, Stevey  [unclear]  I believe played then.  
P:  You guys a winning team?
D:  Oh yeah, we won.  
P:  You win the championship?
D:  No we won the league outright.  We lost the championship.  We had a record of I would say 
probably around 21 and 3.  That was Frank Burgess' pitching.  The slowest pitcher in the league. 
Everybody else had much faster pitchers but every time they played us they wanted to hit the ball
hard.  They always popped it up.  Um, definitely everybody was out to beat us but we had a real 
good team back then.  Real good.  But it was tough coaching Burgess', so after five years.  Well, 
it was really Frankie and I were coaching but more or less.  But I took over but after I got out of 
coaching that was when I started joining softball again.  
P:  Did you play when you coached or just coach?
D:  Oh yeah, I played.  
P:  Then after that you started to play for  [unclear].  
D:  Yeah, uh, I think, uh, Bradley Pool.  Uh
P:  Play for Dracut Tires?
D:  No.  The teams I played for were the Rat Pack, Bradley Pool, The Walbrook, John's  
[unclear], Gaudet's Asphalting now K & B, there are so many of them.  Sponsors are hard to 
come by in sports, you know.  They will promise you the world.  
P:  When you were a coach for Bradley Pool  [unclear]?
D:  Yeah, the best one was John  [unclear], was pretty good.  I used to go down there and, 
we went down there for a game.  If they gave us.  They were pretty honest on the check they
always gave us the check they never gave us the run around.  
P:  What did it cost?  What kind of money are we talking about?
D:  Uh 
P:  A couple of hundred bucks?
D:  Yeah, it used to be probably a hundred, a hundred and ten dollar entry fee and then you
figure you want them to pay for the umpires.  Back then the umpires were twelve or 
fourteen dollars now they are twenty dollars.  They would throw in for that and they would
give you the money for the balls for the season.  So basically without uniforms you could 
probably sponsor a team for around four or five hundred dollars.  And then usually the 
guys always threw in for the uniforms.  (P:  Right)  I don't, There was only one team I think 
I ever played on that they payed for everything and that was in Greater Lowell league.  At 
that time, yeah.  
P:  Who was the best player that you ever played with?
D:  With?
P:  Yeah with.  On your team that you either coached or played with?
D:  I guess I would pretty much have to say Brian  [unclear]  and he is going to read it.  
[laugh]  Uh you know, I am no politician persay so I  [unclear]  head over my shoulders so.  
If there is somebody else they will pay me later.  
P:  Who was the best player you ever played against?
D:  Against?
P:  Who was the best pitcher that you remember over the years?
D:  Uh, well going back over the years would probably be  [Bill]  Marsh or something like 
that when he was in his prime, uh, but they used to see ball players play down in the 
Greater Lowell League that aren't around any more but they used to hit balls that I never 
thought possible could ever even happen.  Uh but
P:  Did you ever play in the Greater Lowell League?
D:  Yeah, played for, uh, two years down there for, uh, Don  [Duranio].  Jimmy and I again 
went down there and Lance played down there.  But I am in softball for fun and that was 
too competitive for me.  
P:  That is interesting  I mean that is one of the things that I would like to bring out in this 
thing is because my guess is that most guys who play, an average typical team, it is a social 
thing.  Also one of the things I would like to get at is why people play.  You know, why are 
they willing to give up over time, you know, make the commitment, or else some, You know,
what is it?  Is it, you know, does it go back to your childhood and part, the chance to run 
around you got, the older we get the less chance you get to do that 
D:  Yup.  Yup.  Well, it is obvious like this is our opening practice, now, right now I do 
about a hundred and fifty to two hundred sit ups a day.  
P:  You do.  
D:  Yeah.  I do like fifty push ups.  And I will be acting like a buga tomorrow.  But it will 
feel good because it is there every season, I mean it is all that I can ever remember you got 
to hurt, you have to, because it is all the muscles and bones you haven't used all winter 
long.  And now they are coming out for spring training.  It will be gone in two weeks and 
then it will all be fun after that.  
P:  This is just the second year that I have played it is funny just being out there  [for some 
reason there is a break in the tape]  Cassie I want you to tell me why you come to the games
here.  Just talk to me don't get nervous.  
Cassie:  I come to the games to see all you guys play softball because you are so good and I 
want to see Greg Dooley because he is the best.  And of course Brian but I see him all the 
time and I want to see Paul and  [unclear].  
?:  Paul stinks.  
P:  Dougy why do you come to the games?  Come over here and talk to me.  
Dougy:  NO!
P:  No, O.K. Fine.  Tell me why.  
Cassie:  O.K.  Everyone else comes to the game  [unclear]  comes to the game because he is a
really good pitcher.  Bobby  [unclear]  comes to the game to share his humor with us all.  
Mark Burgess comes to the game because he is sick of Florida and he wants to come back 
and see Cindy Cavanaugh.  
P:  And he is so good looking.  
 
Cassie:  And Tony always comes to the games because he writes songs about softball after.  
P:  Oh really, uh.  
Cassie:  And Charlie Burgess comes to the games so, it is his team for advertising reasons.  And 
Brian Burgess comes to the games to try and get away from me but I follow him to the games so 
it doesn't work.  
P:  How long have you been watching Brian play softball?
Cassie:  Since I was about ten.  Ten or twelve.  Maybe thirteen.  It depends  [unclear].  
P:  In the Dracut league? 
Cassie:  Jack and Jills.  
P:  Jack and Jills?
Cassie:  Yeah.  Oh you can't there are kids around.  And another very memorable event for me at 
this  [unclear]  field is at that tree over there I pied my pants.  Because I couldn't get down.  
When I was about ten, five or six.  
[they are back in a building again]
D:  Very important because he comes the Greater Lowell League, oh he has been doing it for, 
even since I have played in the Greater Lowell League he has been doing it for about ten years.  
P:  That is incredible, really.  
D:  Yeah, ten years.  
P:  I thought that it was something that guys came from Billerica to play in this league.  
D:  You have all different categories with softball players, O.K.  I did all that when I wanted to 
do it but now you taper down at the end and now I am at the tapering down part.  I am within a 
quarter of a mile of my house, the bar is a quarter of a mile from my house it is a perfect 
situation, you know.  So I play in Dracut Center where I grew up, you know.  It's great.  
P:  How come it seems to me that like when we were growing up there was a much older crowd 
of guys playing, is it because we are older?  It seems like it is a much younger league?  
D:  Well, one of the reasons, it is true it was older but like the old Dracut League now Jimmy and
I used to go to Dracut Center and watch them, but that was slow pitch.  Slow pitch is, it is a 
completely different situation, I mean, a lot of the old timers they can hit the ball, they might not 
be able to move around a lot but they can still hit the ball a mile.  And that is what they used to 
do in the old Dracut League they were older there were guys it wasn't hard to see a team that was
in their forties, you know, I remember that some of the old civic clubs that was what.  Hi Bobby. 
P:  I was surprised like last year was my first year playing and it seemed like, we were like the 
old guys.  
D:  We are I mean don't, uh, we are old.  
P:  We are an old team.  I mean thirty, thirty-two, thirty-four, thirty-eight, whatever, what is 
Charlie thirty-seven maybe thirty-five?  
D:  Oh yeah, you know it doesn't phase me in the least because, The thing that is good about it is 
I still get respect in this league.  I have been around for fourteen years, O.K.  Granted I am not 
what I used to be in the field  but as far as my back goes I am still respected there won't be a 
third baseman that won't play in a line for me and there is not a short stop that won't pull for me. 
But they will watch out for me but that goes along with playing in the same league for fourteen 
years.  But I was always a full hitter and I did good at the game being a full hitter.  I never even 
wanted to hit the right.  But definitely, you know, I am sure right now you are looking at it from 
the point of view, But it was tough for you to play back then because you were going to school 
you were completely, I am here this has been reality for me you know I never left everything is 
the same, it has always been the same for me.  
P:  It has to be living in Dracut.  It is one continuing
D:  Yeah.  It is the same rotation every year.  Exactly the pattern is the same whereas it is not for 
like Brian
P:  He went to Canada.  
D:  Yeah, he is very unpredictable.  I mean there were times where we didn't know if Brian was 
coming back.  Whether we were going to put him on the roster or something like that but, you 
know, the thing hat was good now the thing that was good was that it was good to get back 
together as far as Jimmy and stuff.  Because, uh, Jimmy and I always started together and we 
have done a lot together so it is good.  If there was nobody else Jimmy I really enjoy playing 
with and, uh, 
P:  I think that is one of the nicer things about the team is that it is like a reunion, a reunion team.
We can get them out, and out here you know and
D:  We know, O.K., we are going into this opening season pretty much like one hundred percent 
looking at we probably won't win the leagues, O.K.  I am not saying that couldn't happen 
because the Patriots probably said the same thing last year to and look what happened to them.  
But I can remember being with like I say Frank Burgess the slowest pitcher in the league we had 
the best record that I can ever remember for me.  But every team I have ever been on in my life 
and I have been on a lot I have never ever ever been on a championship team in my life.  Never.  
P:  Never?  
D:  Never.  
P:  On like a total championship the playoffs and everything?  
D:  Yeah.  You are talking four years in High School you are talking basketball, football, cross 
country, track, uh, and softball.  Like I say fourteen years and some years two teams and some 
years three teams and that was the closest I came.  Merchants League we won at the whole 
league two years in a row but we choked at the playoffs and never won it.  Never in my life, 
never.  Now you got Brian, Brian on, I mean, for crying out loud.  
P:  National Championship.  
D:  But it is not that it would never take me away from the game it is not what I am looking for I 
am just here because I know everybody, I have a lot of fun, you never see me, how often do you 
see me mouthing off to the umpires and stuff like that.  I am out to have a good time plus it 
doesn't do any good anyhow.  But Burgess' don't know that.  That gives you
P:  Uncoachable.  [laughs]
D:  Oh yeah, it is like having Patrick out there playing.  You can't talk to him but you have to 
know how to deal with it like I do, right.  
P:  Funny one of the things that I find interesting about this league is that the whole history of 
Dracut, like little fragments of it come back.  I look around and I see  [unclear],  [unclear], Billy  
[unclear]  you know.  
D:  Billy  [unclear]  is a monument in softball.  Billy  [unclear]  played with us he played with us 
for two years.  The kid wouldn't play unless he was screwed up, O.K.  But he always played 
good.  
P:  Right.  
D:  He did, he was good.  
P:  His brother got killed right?  Didn't he?  
D:  I don't know.  
P:  Because my brother played junior league baseball with him and his brother, I don't know.  
D:  [comment unclear]
P:  I got to keep it as best as I can in the background.  So that people can get used to it.  
D:  Well, you are going to have to  [gel]  everything together once you analyze everything when 
you get home.  I don't know how you do it.  
P:  Well, and I think what I want to do through the course of the summer talk to every guy a little
bit in depth you know if I can.  Either before the game of after whatever and sometimes bring 
this in to a
D:  Here we are O.K., you and I, Are you happy where you are?  
P:  Am I?  No, I am not married.  [laughs]  
D:  Well, putting that aside.  As far as picking your literary background.  
P:  I am happy.  I think considering what I kind of set for a goal I think I am on target.  I think it 
would have been extraordinary if I had got some coverage or a grant when I was twenty-six or 
twenty-seven or something like that.  I think I am happy with the way things have gone.  I feel 
like I have made some real common sense decisions that a lot of young writers don't do.  I feel 
like I have put my stake down and I am going to write for the people that I care about.  And I am 
going to write about the places that I care about.  And because of that I have started to build an 
audience.  And I have got some recognition at least, At least there are ninety thousand people in 
Lowell and there are two hundred and fifty thousand people in Greater Lowell uh, I mean even if
I never sold a book outside of Greater Lowell that is a tremendous number of people, you know, 
even though my work has been in magazines all over the country primarily it is just around here 
that people know me.  So I feel pretty good about the whole writing thing um, it is frustrating 
because I think jeez I wish, you know, I had a publisher in New York or something like that.  But
I try to keep the writing thing in perspective, you know, it is just part of what I am I think what 
the problem is that a lot of people will say about artist and writers is that they don't keep it in 
perspective in their life.  I try to be a normal person who happens to write.  
D:  We will put you in that category, O.K., but sometimes that is hard to do.  It always seems like
you writers, I wouldn't as much say you writers as much as your artist, your artist are usually a 
different type of person, O.K., a completely different type of person.  What catagory would we 
put you in white collar or blue collar?  Personally I would say a white collar job.  
P:  As far as my job?  Yeah.  I have an awesome job I am in administration.  
D:  What I am basically getting to is you look into softball as white collar or blue collar the way 
everybody plays together um, You don't see a lot of, In my eyes, O.K.  But you don't always look
into peoples background you don't, You play softball with them O.K., and you might know them 
around town but you never know what they do for a living, O.K., you never know.  You could be 
playing with, uh, I don't know in my eyes I always look at it as everyone is a construction 
worker.  I don't know just because that is all I have ever been around, you know.  But when you 
look into it in depth it is not true.  If you started analyzing what everybody does for a living, 
O.K. 
P:  Jimmy is with the Post Office.  
D:  I mean look at  every individual but you look on some of the other teams and, uh, But 
basically I don't think you would have a team that would be all white collar workers.  
P:  Is it basically a blue collar sport?  
D:  In my eyes I could be one hundred percent wrong, O.K., but that
P:  I think you are right.  
D:  But that is the way I look at it, O.K.  Of course Wang has their own league.  What you call a 
league.  
P:  They got  [forty]  teams.  
D:  Or what you would call a league.  But that is different you know.  That is a completely 
different thing he made his own arrangement for that but this
P:  If you had to catagorize the Dracut Softball League it is definitely a blue collar league.  
D:  I would have to say so.  I would, O.K. 
P:  Even though somebody might be in Real Estate or something like that.  
D:  Yup.  Yup.  But sometimes I you know, When you are doing this look into their backgrounds 
you know what they do for a living.  
P:  That is one of the things I want, Like I  don't know what  [unclear].  
D:  Well, Bobby he worked, he is a white collar he worked at a hospital.  
P:  Personnel or something?  
D:  No, lab, lab work or something to do with the lab or something to do with that.  I don't know 
if it is Boston City Hospital or something like that.  But he works basically  [unclear]  a little bit, 
went out a few weeks ago.  But uh
P:  What about you, What about that question to you?  Are you where you would like to be at?  
D:  Yeah, I, But see it is different with me, O.K.  I just went out and lived life basically I stayed 
right within the, See how I can put this, uh, A lot of times life can be set out for yeah, O.K.  It is 
easier to do sometimes when you stay at home, you don't move away, you don't go to school, uh, 
I have done good as far as job wise, O.K.  I have done the ladder as far as job wise goes.  I mean 
when I, when I first started this league my high school year I was making a dollar sixty an hour.  
O.K.  Now as far as bringing it up to now I would say I feel as though I have done alright, I like 
where I am at right now.  As far as the family goes and the kids everything has pretty much has 
fallen in place.  But what I am trying to say is I have stayed here so I have built everything for 
myself, you know.  Everything fell into the right grove.  With you, you are different, O.K., even 
going into High School.  President of the senior class and the whole nine yards.  That is different.
I was sort of a laid back person I always wanted to help but I never wanted to get involved, O.K. 
P:  You had your own kind of identity
D:  I would help anybody, well as far as this league goes I help this league out plenty of times.  I 
didn't want to be President, I didn't want to be Vice-President many a time I did more work in 
this league then anybody can imagine but don't give me the title I don't want the phone calls I 
don't want anything that goes along with it.  But with you, Well, getting back to that we are sort 
of jumping back and forth here but with you when you went to College and it is a hard field that 
you picked, you know.  Probably the toughest, you know.  It could have been archaeology, you 
know that could have hurt too.  
P:  That is tougher, yeah.  
D:  You could be playing softball over in Egypt someplace.  But you have done good, you know. 
You have done very well for yourself and you are back home.  And you like what you are doing. 
P:  Yeah, I think, I like it that is one of the things I like about the fact I, I mean I went to live in 
California it was great.  I think I would have stayed out there longer but there is something, 
There is something about, Maybe because of those  other parts of my life I am reaching for some 
things that are really kind of difficult and I am dealing with things that are very complicated in 
terms of being an artist or whatever of however you want to put it.  Some how the stability of 
being in Dracut is really reassuring, you know.  
D:  You know everybody.  It is like, if I am going to go for a beer I am at home if I come in here 
ninety-nine percent of the time there is going to be a guy here I know, O.K.  If I move away that 
is not going to happen unless the town I go to 
END OF SIDE ONE 
BEGINNING OF SIDE TWO
P:  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
P:  Well, we had the last of our softball practices last night we have had four or five practices 
over the past month.  We met again at the Junior High School, behind the Junior High School in 
Dracut.  Unfortunately last night all the fields were taken by softball teams and Little League 
teams practicing.  So we had to find a little area between the fields where we could do some 
throwing and playing pepper and so forth.  I could only stay for an hour last night.  But we had a 
pretty good turn out, about eight guys, Greg, Jimmy, Charlie, Mark Burgess, Paul Burgess, Tony 
[Gomes], Lefty, I have got to find out Lefty's name, his full name.  We practiced one Sunday 
morning at  [carrot]  field for about three hours.  That was an excellent practice got a lot of 
hitting in.  We practiced a couple of night behind the Junior High School.  So at least we have 
been out there and, uh, and everybody has a feel for the bat and the ball.  Opening day is Sunday.
I am going to get the schedule tomorrow find out what time the game is on Sunday.  Hope we 
play a good team it would be good to play against one of the better teams on opening day.  
Tomorrow is Lance Burgess' wedding so a lot of the guys on the team will be at Lance's 
wedding.  Lance is getting married to Doreen.  What else, what else, We have got the shirts and 
hats we have navy blue shirts V-neck white lettering on the front that says Burgess.  So we are 
going to be known as the Burgess Team people will say we are playing Burgess tonight.  
Charlie's, uh, I guess Charlie and Brian are going to sponsor the team.  Last night at practice 
some friend of Charlie's who was a whole saler of sports equipment showed up and he was 
showing the guys some bats and spikes, cleats, It was funny to have the equipment distributor 
coming to the field.  Like we were some important team or something.  Heard some good stories,
interesting antidotes from the guys during the practices.  I probably should have had the tape 
recorder but I tried to make some notes.  Have to talk to Lefty about his story about the brown 
bat he had I think he was at Saint Joseph's High School.  The brothers were teaching and he was 
on the baseball team there.  They didn't have a lot of equipment there was this one brown bat 
everybody liked it, it broke and they nailed it and taped it the brother would say you can't hit 
with this and he would throw it out.  After every game or practice when he would try to trash it 
they would go and dig it out of the trash barrel and it would show up at the next game.  He told 
some interesting stories about not wanting to play softball at first because after he had played 
baseball he couldn't picture  himself playing softball because he thought it was a girl's sport or 
whatever.  Then he got into it and played a lot and he is older, th oldest guy on the team.  he is 
the father of Charlie's girl friend Sue.  French, he is a French guy Lefty, I don't know his name 
though.  And what else, Mark Burgess, Mark was in the army and then got into acting and 
modeling in Florida and New York.  He appeared as an extra in one episode of Miami Vice, he 
has done a lot of catalog fashion work.  He just signed up with an agency in Boston.  He is going 
to be here all summer so he is going to play with us, he is a good athlete.  Very good athlete.  I 
think we are going to have a good team everybody seems to be saying, yeah, I think we are going
to have a good season.  We have got some good hitters, picked up some guys who will show up 
regularly, Bobby  [Butters].  I was talking to Bobby at Lance Burgess' Bachelor party a few 
weeks ago he was excited about playing he works as an assistant to a doctor in a Boston Hospital
and he was telling me how he felt about softballs.  And I need to talk to him again about that so I 
think I would like to do maybe one post game interview after every game.  I am going to try Jim 
Higgins to come and photograph the first meeting, uh, the first meeting opening day and see if he
can come to every other game that kind of thing there are twenty-two games.  And we will see 
how it all builds up, try to keep a journal to go  along with the interviews, uh, and see what it all 
adds up to.  [goes from talking about the team to interviewing the team]

P:  Game Notes:  Sunday April 27th opening day.  Just a few quick notes.  It was misty, damp, 
the field was pretty soaked, the grass was high in the out field, the ball was just going nowhere.  
Brian hit one ball and smacked it and everybody thought it was going into the next county and it 
just stopped.  It ended up being a sacrifice fly.  It was a small crowd a lot of the usuals, regulars, 
hangerons, supporters of the league, President Ronny  [Lowe], Bob Saint, Saint Hilare, Dana  
[Hutly]  came down to watch us, and Stevie  [Body]  and his girlfriend Lisa came down to see us.
In the notes that I wrote in the notebook I mentioned Jim Higgins was there and took a team 
photo and Joan came with the kids Elie, Jessy, and Anna were all there.  Of course unfortunately 
I struck out the first time up which kind of sucked.  But I was, I will blame it on the fact that my 
bat disappeared before the game started.  I put it down by the bench and I think as the other team 
from the prior game was pulling out they just must of picked up my bat with some of the 
remaining stuff that they had I hope nobody stole it, I hope I get it back.  I am going to check 
Wednesday night when that team has another game.  It was very, very disconcerting.  Uh, next 
time up I flyed to center field, not a very good hit either.  Played half the game and then Kevin  
[Molten]  came in and played the other half at second base.  After the game we went into a civic 
club has this little kind of a picnic, outside building, uh, where they have a bar and they were 
selling hot dogs and everybody was in there hollering and laughing and generally being happy 
and conducting post game business.  Johnny  [McGinnes]  was selling raffle tickets for a buck 
each to raise money for I think Billerica Softball of course he says raffle tickets have no number 
it just goes by name and then someone says he saw them, And I said no winners either.  And 
someone says they saw him throwing out the ticket stubs with the names on them to.  So anyway 
chalk that one up.  And, what else, oh yeah, there was a woman from Nova Scotia one of a pair 
of twins, good looking women that Brian knew.  Guess they have relative in Lowell and they 
were here watching.  She was going to do, Go back to Nova Scotia tonight.  So it was good, the 
line up was let's see who batted first, Bobby Butters, played well had a couple of hits and an 
excellent put out not a put out an assist from center field making a double play at the plate.  Paul 
Burgess excellent defensive play filled in a catcher after Tony  [Gomes]  left held on to the ball 
and big collision, and completed a double play.  It was a very important play late in the game.  
So Bobby Butters batted first, then it went Mark Burgess, and then Brian, and then John  
[McGinnes], and then let's see McGinnes, I think Charlie Burgess, and Greg Dooley, and then 
Tony, Tony  [Gomes], all the other way around Tony  [Gomes]  and then Greg Dooley, and then 
me, and then, who followed me, Paul Burgess who followed me, and then Jimmy Allen and I 
think that was it.  Yeah, I think that was the line up.  but, uh, Richy Burgess got in there to play 
right field, and a new guy on the team Dick Cormier got in to play right field to and then Kevin 
Molten went in to finish off second base after me, so everybody played.  So it was a good win, it 
was really a team effort, scrappy, gritty game, back and forth, we were down four nothing and 
then we came back and tied it, they tied it, we went up, they tied it again, and we went ahead 
again, lots of key moments, lots of key hits, and we got a few breaks and, uh, and it added up to a
win which was very good.  Uh, to start the season with the next game is Friday at the Civic Club 
and we are playing, who are we playing on Friday, the  [Corebus Team]  a young team, I think 
we are the oldest team in the league.  So that is it April twenty-seven game started ten thirty, ten 
forty-five and finished close to one o'clock, a long game.  Civic Club don't know a lot of the 
players, Ralph  [unclear]  is still the coach, been around a thousand years in Dracut, was a Babe 
Ruth League coach when I was playing Babe Ruth League.  Ronnie  [unclear]  third baseman 
was in High School with me, uh, the pitcher is Willie Doby a big black guy, uh, he was erratic, 
but he could throw with some speed, he got it by me anyway.  Had a couple of Hispanics, 
Carmello is one guy, and I don't know the other guys name.  Uh, but I think over all we had 
better talent, uh, and I think we have the horses to win quite a few games this year.
