Madame I Have a Very Fine Farm
MADAME I HAVE A VERY FINE FARM 4114 21B2
Vernon Allen Shafter, 1940
Madame I have a very fine farm And it's sixty acres wide And you can have it at your
command If you will be my bride.
Yes sir, I know you've a very fine farm And it's sixty acres wide But who would stay with
me at night While you're off playing cards?
Madame, I never did do such a thing For I never did think it right And if you will be my
bride, bride, bride, I won't stay away at night.
Yes sir, I know that's just all talk And just to take me in I wonder if you think that I Would
marry a barrel of gin?
Madame you are a very true girl And very hard to please When you get old and out in the
cold I hope to God you freeze.
When I get old and out in the cold I'll have no drunkard to please, please, please, I'll have
no drunkard to please.
Madame I have a very fine horse And his pace is like a kite And you can have him at your
command If you will be my bride.
Yes sir, I know you've a very fine horse And he stands in yonder barn His master knows
some very bad habits And I'm afraid that horse would larn.
