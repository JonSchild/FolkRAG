Beaver Cap, Sir
BEAVER CAP, SIR 5116 A1
Bill Jackson Arvin, 1941
I went to town the other day To buy me a hat, Sir And everything that they put down It was
a beaver cap, Sir. Too la loller whack a loller Too la loller day, Sir.
I went home that very night I laid it on my bed, Sir Every time that I woke up I tried it on my
head, Sir. Too la loller whack a loller Too la loller day, Sir.
I went to work the other day A-feelin' mighty flat, Sir When I come in my Mother'd set A
hen in my old beaver cap, Sir. Too la loller whack a loller Too la loller day, Sir.
I picked them eggs up one by one You bet I had some fun, Sir - Threw them at my
mother's head, They fanned her as she run, Sir. Too la loller whack a loller Too la loller
day, Sir.
My wife got mad the other day She took me by the nap, Sir Threw me right out in the yard
And stomped my beaver cap, Sir. Too la loller whack a loller Too la loller day, Sir.
