START OF RECORDING 
Female 1 : From the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian National 
Museum of African American History and Culture. 
DAVID CLINE: Good morning. It’s June 20, 2014. My name is David 
Cline, and Fm here in Chester, Virginia, on behalf of the Smithsonian’s National 
Museum of African American History and Culture, to interview the Reverend Dr. Wyatt 
T. Walker. 
DC: I neglected to say thank you very much for meeting with us this morning. 
It’s quite an honor for me personally. 
WYATT T. WALKER: I appreciate the memories. My name is Wyatt T. 
Walker. I was born in Brockton, Massachusetts, August 16, 1928. My only claim to 
fame is that I was once chief of staff to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 
DC: That’s quite a claim to fame. If I may, F m always interested in how 
people’s backgrounds influenced the way their lives later played out. So could you tell us 
a little bit about your family and growing up?

AFC 2010/039: CRHP0109 
Wyatt Tee Walker and Theresa Walker 
WTW: I grew up as a preacher’s kid. My father had a congregation in South 
Jersey of about a hundred, a small church. He was a very, very scholarly gentleman. He 
read Greek and Hebrew every day. His style of ministry, I’m sure, influenced me and my 
work as a pastor. He wasn’t too keen about me joining Martin Luther King and leaving 
the church I was serving in Petersburg at the time, but he came to appreciate it a great 
deal. 
DC: Could you tell us a little bit about—. 
Male 1: David? 
DC: Yes. 
Male 1 : I’m hearing you go “Mm-hmm.” 
DC: OK. 
Male 1 : OK, carry on. 
DC: Yes. Did you have any early encounters with racism or segregation to 
Jersey that you recall? 
WTW: I lost my first girlfriend because of it. There was a little girl who lived 
about two blocks from my home named Nancy, and we used to play together. One day 
she came to the curb from her house, and she was sort of crying, and she said she 
couldn’t play with me anymore. I said, “Why?” She said, “Because you’re colored.” I 
didn’t even know what that meant, but later I understood it. 
My first schooling was in the segregated schools, and my first experience of 
integration in education was in junior high school and high school. And in the town that I 
lived in, there was a drug store, and you couldn’t be served in it. The Ku Klux Klan was 
2 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0109 
Wyatt Tee Walker and Theresa Walker 
operative in the area. They burned a cross on one of Father Divine’s headquarters. It 
was like growing up in the South, really, but I couldn’t compare it until later on in life. 
My father was a race man. He was always involved in trying to find some 
reconciliation between the white and the black community. I grew up with a portrait of 
Frederick Douglass on the wall, and so I was very familiar with the history of our people 
in America. I resented everything about the segregation pattern that existed, I guess 
widely, but in the section of North, South Jersey that we lived in, and we called it Little 
Georgia, because it was so bad. 
DC: When you were called to the church, did you initially think that the church 
might be a way for you to address these issues? 
WTW: Not initially. In fact, when I finished university I was a major in physics 
and chemistry, and I wanted to be a physician, but the call to the ministry seemed to be 
more pressing because of my experiences in Richmond, Virginia, with segregation and 
discrimination [5:00], I saw that as the best means of fighting segregation in any form 
that I found it. The black preacher is the freest man in society, because he is accountable 
to the black community, and I had discerned that in my early college experience. 
DC: What kinds of things did you involve your congregation in early on, in 
terms of the question of segregation? 
WTW: Well, it was more active when I was a pastor in Harlem. We were against 
the drug traffic, and we picketed and demonstrated, marched against the drug enterprises. 
I guess my interest focused on seniors, the drug traffic, and working to develop 
affordable housing. At the point that I left New York, I had become the largest developer 
of affordable housing in New York State, so that’s a part of the legacy of my service. 
3 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0109 
Wyatt Tee Walker and Theresa Walker 
DC: Wonderful. We’ll get to that story in a little bit. If I could focus just for a 
second on Richmond and your first pastorate here? 
WTW: Well, I went to the undergraduate school of Virginia Union [University], 
and then I went to the graduate school of religion to earn my M. Div. I was called to a 
church in Petersburg in my last year. I was twenty-two years old, I thought. I really 
found out recently that I was twenty-three. I had always used my birth year as [19]29, 
and visiting a sister who was recovering from an automobile accident, she had my 
mother’s papers, among which was my birth certificate, and my birthday was 1928. 
Instead of me looking forward to my eighty-sixth birthday, I’m looking forward to my 
eighty-seventh in August this year. 
DC: Congratulations. So, after Petersburg? 
WTW: Well, I was in Petersburg eight years as the pastor of the Gillfield Baptist 
Church, which is over two hundred years old. I went to New York and joined the 
corporate world. I was in a publishing firm, I was a marketing director, and then I went 
to, I was called to, a church in Harlem, and I served there for thirty-seven years. It was a 
wonderful ministry in the way it responded to my leadership. 
DC: Wonderful. Can I ask you about an early incident with a library? Was 
that here in Richmond? 
WTW: That was in Petersburg. 
DC: Petersburg. Can you tell us a little bit about that? 
WTW: Yes. Of course, everything was segregated in Petersburg when I arrived, 
including the ministerial alliance. The first experience I had in integrating was 
integrating it with the chaplain of Virginia State and another pastor in the town, R. G. 
4 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0109 
Wyatt Tee Walker and Theresa Walker 
Williams. We integrated the ministry of alliance. About eight years later, I tried to get 
the city council to integrate the library, and they would not even consider it. For some 
reason, the NAACP would not make a case of it, and I felt they had pulled the rug from 
under me. So I, influenced again by King, I had a demonstration, and we went there on 
February 27, 1960. We went through the white door, [for] which we were promptly 
arrested in a few minutes, and two of us, the same R.G. Williams, we decided to stay in 
jail, and we stayed in jail a couple of days. Of course, that was, back in that day, that was 
[10:00] big news and unusual, because the black community of Petersburg had been so 
cowered by the system of segregation that they wouldn’t even think of trying to integrate 
a facility. It happened that it was the first time the libraries had been assaulted in the 
South. 
DC: Do you remember what book it was that you checked out? 
WTW: Yes, I do. I asked for volume one of Douglas Southall Freeman’s 
biography of Robert E. Lee. I always thought Lee was guilty of treason, and I just 
thought I’d look at this book to see what the Southern view was, why they made him such 
a hero. 
DC: Did anybody comment on the fact that you had checked out Lee’s 
biography? 
WTW: Well, I’ve seen several articles about it, of how I asked ironically for that 
book, and that led to my arrest. 
DC: Did you already know Dr. King at that point, or at what point did you get 
to know him? 
5 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0109 
Wyatt Tee Walker and Theresa Walker 
WTW: Oh, I got to know him in 19—it must have been 1952. Ijoined his 
organization, and he put me on the board, and I did some writing for him and press 
releases, because I had that set of skills. I’d been close to him since 1952 until his death. 
In fact, the day before he was assassinated he had called my home and wanted to talk to 
me about something. I don’t know why. I have always imagined that he wanted me to 
come to Memphis to help with the march that had gone on the day before. But, you 
know, I just don’t know. But he had a great influence on my life. When I went to 
Petersburg as a pastor, I carried a Smith & Wesson nickel-plated .32, and at Martin 
Luther King’s influence, I put my gun down. I was waiting for some racist to cross my 
path, and I had in my mind that I had this pistol to shoot him. I got that idea from my 
father, who was in a train station somewhere near Emporia, Virginia, and it was cold, and 
he went in the so-called white waiting room, and a constable came in there and told him 
he had to leave. My father told him it was too cold, and the constable raised his 
nightstick to hit him. My father said he had his coat on, and he had his trigger on the 
gun. He said if that baton had started down, he was going to shoot him. So from the very 
beginning of my father’s early life to my early life, that’s why I say I know he was a race 
man. I’m sure I inherited some of that. 
DC: So was the concept of nonviolence and practicing nonviolence— 
WTW: No, it wasn’t in vogue at that time. 
DC: Yeah. So did that take some training and getting used to that idea for you? 
WTW: Well, it took a lot of reading, and hearing King over and over again, and 
seeing his commitment to nonviolence made me adopt it as a way of life. But all through 
college I envisioned putting together some smart, young black men who developed the 
6 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0109 
Wyatt Tee Walker and Theresa Walker 
expertise and using plastic bombs and putting ice picks through their opponents’ ears, 
like Bill Bowen and Eastland. That was what I fantasized during my college years. Then 
I ended up as Dr. King’s right-hand man in nonviolence. So life has its quirks and turns. 
DC: It’s a journey, isn’t it [15:00], certainly. Certainly. So you began working 
on the board. When were you first called to actually join the organization? 
WTW: Nineteen—well, he invited me to the initial meeting in Atlanta, but I didn’t 
have enough money to go. So I didn’t join the SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference] until the meeting in Clarksdale, Mississippi, in 1958,1 think it was. That’s 
when he put me on the board, and I began to work close to him until his death. 
DC: And when you came on as a staff member, that was— 
WTW: That was 1960. He invited me to become an executive director of the 
organization, to help build it into what became, in my view, the most powerful civil rights 
organization in the [19]60s. 
DC: You came in after Ella Baker. 
WTW: Oh, absolutely. 
DC: What was it like coming in after her? 
WTW : She was the interim executive director, but I was after her. I knew her 
from earlier experience, but that was after the fact. 
DC: What was the situation with the organization when you first arrived, and 
how did you manage to grow it over just a few years? 
WTW: I used to describe it as mainly an idea in Dr. King’s briefcase, and trying to 
connect churches and pastors is a formidable task. I flew by the seat of my pants, as they 
say. I put a fund-raising system in. The budget my first year was $57,000. We did over 
7 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0109 
Wyatt Tee Walker and Theresa Walker 
$100,000, and in four years, when I went, I took two members with me from my staff in 
Petersburg, and that made SCLC have five staff members, because there were two 
working here. Four years later, we had a budget of a million dollars and a hundred full¬ 
time employees. I worked primarily as an administrator and a fund raiser. There were 
some way stations along the way, but things didn’t really start popping until Albany and 
Birmingham. 
DC: Before we get to Albany, I just want to ask you, talking about money, how 
important was money to the success? 
WTW: It is the ammunition. It takes money to run an organization, and to run 
campaigns, and to train people, and that’s what we needed the money for, because 
nonviolence was an altogether novel concept in 1960 and [19]61. We developed it into a 
driving force which changed the nation, in a way. It was responsible for desegregating 
America. 
DC: Of course, the movement in the streets is perceived to be really driving this 
change, and it’s a huge part of it, but there’s so much going on behind the scenes. 
WTW: Oh, absolutely. There were so many pundits who thought that we just 
decided to go to a place and have some demonstrations, but it wasn’t. We started a year 
ahead of time in Birmingham. That’s an illustration of what it takes to do, to have great 
movements. 
DC: I would guess so. We were talking, just about to talk about Albany, 
Georgia, and if you could tell us a little bit about the invitation to come to Albany and the 
situation that you found there. And then I’ll ask you a little bit afterwards how that led to 
your tactics in Birmingham. 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0109 
Wyatt Tee Walker and Theresa Walker 
WTW: Well, Albany was considered by the media and the pundits who observed 
what was going on that it was a failure, but in my view it was a success. We just made 
some mistakes [20:00] in Albany we shouldn’t have, but we did make them. But we 
were just beginning a social revolution, so that’s understandable. The problem in Albany 
was twofold. One, they had too many targets. It was initiated by the workers, the SNCC 
workers, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. That resulted in the 
community being exhausted for fund raising and rallies, etc. SNCC realized that they 
were in over their heads, and so they invited Dr. King to come. Well, when King goes, I 
went. I have the reputation of running a tight ship, and I reacted very defensively when 
they limited Dr. King to one vote, and whatever the vote was, contrary to his advice, I 
thought was a mistake. 
So there was some internecine warfare between the organizations, the CORE 
[Congress of Racial Equality] people, the NAACP, the local community organization, 
and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Lou [Louis] Lomax, who never went 
to Albany, was an African American journalist, said Dr. King left Albany with his tail 
between his legs, you know, some remark that it was a failure, and Lou Lomax never 
came to Albany. All he did was telephone interviews with students from SNCC, and, of 
course, they had their own view. The organizational competition was very sharp, and 
that’s what caused the Albany power structure to be intransigent, because they knew of 
this problem that we had with each other. 
As I said before, the other thing was that they had too many targets. But when we 
left Albany, everything was closed, the parks and the library. It was like a Mexican 
standoff. But in the process, the significance of Albany is that we learned how to 
9 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0109 
Wyatt Tee Walker and Theresa Walker 
mobilize an entire community for a campaign, and if it had not been for Albany and the 
experience we had there, we would not have won the Birmingham campaign. So to me, 
that is its chief significance. 
DC: I’m going to ask you just in a second the lessons and how you applied 
them in Birmingham. But I want to ask about a specific person there during the Albany 
campaign, and that’s Charles Sherrod, who was with SNCC, who you knew well. 
WTW: Yes, in fact, I raised him in my congregation in Petersburg and got a well- 
to-do man to help finance his education, so I knew Sherrod very well. At times he had 
been to my home and stayed. So here’s another one of those ironies of struggle. 
DC: Now there’s a story that Sherrod told—I don’t know if you recall this 
incident, but I always loved this story—that apparently in Albany at some point, in a 
meeting with Robert Kennedy, and Kennedy was saying he didn’t want to see any more 
direct action, he wanted to see voter registration, Sherrod got so angry—this is Sherrod 
telling this story—that he got so angry he wanted to take a swing, he almost took a swing 
at the attorney general, and you held him back. Do you remember that? 
WTW: I remember that meeting. That was in Washington, DC. The Kennedy 
administration was always telling us to put our energy into voter registration, and it was 
doomed for failure if we did. It was protest marches and the action that made our 
movement what it was. The obstacles to black votes and voting was, they were huge. 
The right to vote [25:00] was theoretical at best. 
DC: OK, so after Albany, and sights are set on Birmingham, and you say 
you’ve learned some lessons from Albany, what were those? How did you plan for the 
next battle? 
10 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0109 
Wyatt Tee Walker and Theresa Walker 
WTW: The primary lesson was how to organize an entire community for a 
campaign. In Albany, we had sections of the city that we worked in developing, and we 
moved the mass meetings around from place to place in order to publicize what we were 
doing. In Birmingham, the first week of the demonstrations there, the bus company went 
on strike. But we held mass meetings every night in some community for forty-three 
nights. It was just amazing what we were able to do, when I look back at it. But that was 
the strength that we had. We had learned those lessons in Albany more than anyplace 
else. 
DC: Now you had become a convert to nonviolent strategy at this point. 
WTW: Oh, yes. 
DC: But you were fond of this word “confrontation.” So nonviolence doesn’t 
mean no confrontation. 
WTW: Oh, Project C, yes. 
DC: Can you tell me a little bit about the necessity for confrontation? 
WTW: Well, Dr. King has assigned me the task of working out a campaign 
strategy for Birmingham. I went to Birmingham a year ahead of time. I went to the 
stores, and I measured how long it would take a young person, and a middle-aged person, 
and an aged person to go to the stores, how many seats were available in the eating 
facility. So I was very detailed in that, and that’s how Project C grew. When I presented 
that to the executive committee of SCLC, it was unanimously accepted. Project C was 
the heart of the campaign in Birmingham and led to the desegregation of America with 
the Public Accommodations Act of 1964. 
11 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0109 
Wyatt Tee Walker and Theresa Walker 
DC: Just for clarification, Project C was the blueprint. Can you say what that 
stands for and what the plan was? 
WTW: Well, Project C, confrontation, that we had to confront the evil that we’d 
discerned in the segregation system. The only way we could join it. We had in the back 
of our minds that Bull Connor would do something that would help us, and he did. He 
reacted, you know, in his way to our demonstrations, and if it hadn’t been for Bull 
Connor, we wouldn’t have had the TV pictures that saturated America and foreign 
countries and forced the business community to decide that we better talk. 
DC: So Bull Connor played right into this? 
WTW: He played into our hands. For some reason, he had this idea that we 
should not be able to go downtown. If he had let us go on the first, or the second march, 
or the third march, after about three or four marches downtown to pray, what else was 
new? But it was his resistance to that which made the movement and got us sympathy 
from all quarters of the nation. 
DC: What about the children’s movement part of that campaign? 
WTW: Well, the nonviolent credo details that anybody can be in the movement. 
The blind singer, A1 Kibbler, was arrested in Birmingham. So we didn’t have any 
qualms, Dr. King and I didn’t, and Jim Bevel, and we decided we’d use the children. We 
knew there would be criticism about it, but the Children’s March is what [30:00] toppled 
the segregationist system in Birmingham. When people saw the firemen with the power 
hoses, using them against children, running them down the sidewalk, they said, “This 
won’t do.” Actually, a physician in Mississippi told his son, who was my New 
Testament instructor at United Theological Seminary in Dayton, he said, “Segregation is 
12 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0109 
Wyatt Tee Walker and Theresa Walker 
over,” and he was very prophetic in that and discerning, because people just didn’t see— 
they wouldn’t accept treating children that way. 
DC: And the power of those images. How did you develop a sense of how 
these, using the media in such a way to help your cause? 
WTW: We did that with great premeditation. We wanted to get on, three or four 
minutes on the Huntley-Brinkley Report. So we—I guess I was responsible. I told Dr. 
King when I, when he said to me, “You got to find some way to dramatize our situation.” 
We were late with one of our demonstrations, and instead of marching at 2:00, they 
marched at 4:00. By that time a thousand people had gathered, expecting something to 
happen. And it was, a lot of the injuries were to onlookers, not participants in the 
struggle. I called Atlanta. I told them, “I got it. Leader,” I said, “I got it. I know what to 
do.” I said, “I can’t tell you on the phone.” And when I got back to Atlanta I told them 
we had to slow down our demonstrations until the people came home and were going to 
gather, and Bull Connor would do something silly, which is what he did, put the dogs on 
us, use the water hoses. We were then—I felt we were home free, because we made the 
Huntley-Brinkley Report about two or three nights in a row. That was a key to the 
success of Birmingham, the use of the media. 
DC: Now, going back to the finances for a second. Would you see an increase 
in fund raising after this? 
WTW: Oh, absolutely, without a doubt. I’m trying to think of the figures now, 
but they don’t, they escape me now. But Birmingham put us, the Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference, on the map. You knew about the NAACP. They were outlawed 
in Alabama, so they couldn’t operate, and they didn’t have an action program. They were 
13 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0109 
Wyatt Tee Walker and Theresa Walker 
not given to demonstrations; they were fighting the battle through the courts. To get 
integration would take a hundred years if you just relied on the courts, and we sensed 
that. 
DC: Can I ask you, if you will, to talk about the personal sacrifices you made at 
those times, in terms of putting yourself in harm’s way, your family, the kinds of things 
that you experienced, or did at home? 
WTW: Never thought about it. I think we were so faithful in our struggle and 
strengthened by our religious fervor. My wife, who is sitting here with us, was assaulted 
by an Alabama state trooper with a rifle, and I was beaten up on Mother’s Day. I had a 
broken wrist, and three broken ribs, and dislocated in my back from the batons of the 
Alabama state highway patrolman. But we never considered it. We never considered the 
danger. We were so committed to the idea that we were right and moral in our struggle 
that we never thought of the danger. Of [35:00] course, we’d had some lives lost and 
some injuries that plague us to today. 
DC: So how did you feel then at the—I mean, we can call it the end—of the 
Birmingham campaign? 
WTW: Well, I guess a word that I learned, a twenty-five-cent word, we were 
euphoric. Dr. King had said before we went to Birmingham, “If we can crack 
Birmingham, we can crack the South.” And that’s what happened. 
DC: So afterwards what was the, what were the sort of next steps? 
WTW: Well, we would take on anybody. We were like the heavyweight 
champions then. 
DC: And for you personally, what did you do after Birmingham? 
14 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0109 
Wyatt Tee Walker and Theresa Walker 
WTW: Well, I was made the Southern regional coordinator for the March on 
Washington, which was highly successful. It was an extension of our movement. There 
wasn’t anything we couldn’t do after Birmingham—that we wouldn’t try, anyway. 
DC: Can you tell me a little bit about the planning for and looking back on the 
March on Washington? 
WTW: Well, Project C, which I created at the behest of Dr. King’s assignment, 
was used as the outline for the campaign in Birmingham. It became—well, in fact, we 
were trying to do Atlanta, the city, and it was the Birmingham plan. We were going to do 
Danville, Virginia, which was a very mean city. President Kennedy was assassinated, 
and Dr. King felt that in the wake of his assassination maybe we wouldn’t go to Danville, 
so that’s why Danville was rescheduled. 
DC: I wonder if you could reflect—how are you doing? OK? Do you want to 
take a break or anything? 
WTW: I’m all right. 
DC: All good? OK. Could you reflect a little bit on the legislation that was 
finally achieved, the civil rights legislation? 
WTW: Well, we attribute to Birmingham the Public Accommodations Act of 
1964, and Birmingham led to Selma and the Selma march, which led to the voting bill of 
1965, too. So two major civil rights bills were the product of our campaigns in 
Birmingham and Selma. They changed the complexion of politics and economics in the 
South. 
15 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0109 
Wyatt Tee Walker and Theresa Walker 
DC: When those passed did you feel that you had achieved—obviously you had 
achieved something, but did you feel that you had achieved what you had set out to do, or 
there would be more down the road? 
WTW: Well, as I said, once we finished with Birmingham we felt we could take 
on anybody or anything. It was inspirational to all the participants in the movement. 
There just wasn’t anything we wouldn’t try. We were convinced that God was with us. 
If it had not been for the religious infrastructure of the black community, we would have 
never achieved what we achieved. 
DC: Can you tell me a little bit more about that and the role of the ministers, 
because I know it’s very complicated? 
WTW: Well, our mass rallies were services with religious songs. Spirituals from 
a hundred years old were cast with new lyrics, which we made into freedom songs. So 
there wouldn’t have been any movement had it not been for the African American church 
forces. Not only the people, the adults, but the young people were [40:00] a part of it. 
That’s why the mass rallies were so religious-oriented. It was a natural thing. It was the 
connection and the confederation of the black churches that made our movement 
possible. 
DC: Absolutely. Then King also spoke out against some of the—the preacher in 
the big Cadillac, for example, and then, of course, the white allies who didn’t come to the 
battle. 
WTW: Well, Dr. King was critical of that type of preacher, but it didn’t—it was 
just a passing, common criticism. Most of the movement ministers were real serving 
16 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0109 
Wyatt Tee Walker and Theresa Walker 
priests. Most of us were influenced by the kind of ministry that Dr. King had pursued in 
Montgomery. 
DC: I know that you were quite involved in typing and working with King on 
the letter from the Birmingham jail, which was addressed to so-called white, so-called 
allies. Can you tell us a little bit about that, the frustrations? 
WTW: Well, the interesting thing is that I was the only one in Birmingham who 
could make out Dr. King’s chicken-scratch writing. We were doing it from the edges of 
newspapers, from toilet paper, whatever we had. My secretary typed until she was 
exhausted. We spent two or three nights translating it. So I did the last part of it, and it 
had become the rationale, the raison d’etre of our movement, and the most important 
document of the twentieth century, I believe. It equals the Gettysburg Address, in my 
judgment. 
DC: I completely agree with you. Are you able to go back to that moment in 
time when you were reading this chicken scratch with a pencil, written with a pencil stub, 
in the margin of a newspaper and seeing these words emerge? Can you remember the— 
WTW: Well, it just came, it came to me. I recognized that when I was translating 
it, that it was an unusual document, and that put us in a mode of haste, because Dr. King 
wanted to see the copy before it went to press. The Society of Friends, the Quakers, 
printed the first version of it, and they called it “Tears of Love.” I told them, “No, it 
should be called ‘Letter from a Birmingham Jail.’” So I named it. The rest is history. 
The marvelous thing about it is that Dr. King had not much to work with, had no library, 
no books, and it was what I call muscle memory from his training that made it such an 
important document.

DC: Now when—you moved on to a career in publishing, as you mentioned, 
briefly after that. What led you to move out of the daily SCLC work? 
WTW: Well, economics, probably, or honestly. The board of SCLC froze my 
salary at $10,000 a year. I had a wife and four children. I couldn’t make it. This 
publisher from New York dangled $25,000 in my face, and I was gone. I had told the 
board of SCLC, I said, “You are going to look up one day, and I’ll be gone.” And that’s 
the way it turned out. They sent Dr. King, Sr., Daddy King, out to my house in Atlanta to 
try to persuade me to stay. I remember he was looking at the back window at a little 
stream ran through our [45:00] property, and he said, “Why? What are you going to do 
up in New York?” I told him I was going to be a marketing vice president for this 
publishing firm that was putting together a serious book about black life in America and 
the world. And he said, “What are they going to pay you?” I said, “They’re going to 
start me at twenty-five thousand a year.” He said, “Well, you go on up there, boy.” Said, 
“You‘ve got to care of Ann and these babies.” 
Dr. King begged me to stay, but I just—they got it, that I felt the board of SCLC 
didn’t. I had a responsibility of administering a million-dollar budget, and they were 
paying me, freezing my salary at ten thousand, and I had a wife and four children. I used 
to say that I wouldn’t let—I didn’t want white folks to exploit me, I wasn’t going to let 
black folks do it either. So that’s why I left. 
DC: Now did you remain close to King in those years when you went to New 
York? 
WTW: Oh, yes. I remained his best—I was his man in New York and 
representative to the UN. I still worked with him. In 1967,1 was in New York as a 
18 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0109 
Wyatt Tee Walker and Theresa Walker 
pastor, and we had a case in Birmingham for parading without a permit, and Dr. King 
was absolutely committed to the nonviolent credo. He said, “After we have exhausted 
our remedies, then whatever it is, we do so.” We went to jail in 1967. Part of that 
experience was, he took my picture, and I took his picture, in the Birmingham jail. In 
fact, the picture is pretty famous, although someone tried to steal credit for it. But 
whoever took it had to be in jail with Dr. King, so it’s been no problem. I now have all 
the rights to it. Some people use it without permission, but it’s all right with me. 
DC: You had been called—you were alluding to the pastorate in New York? 
WTW: In New York, yeah. A marvelous congregation. When I left, there were 
1,800 members, and eighty percent of them paid tithes. The last two years I was there, 
we received over a million dollars just from the tithes of the members. For a church in 
the center of Harlem, I thought it was fantastic. 
DC: Could I ask you about your formal installation at the church? Dr. King 
was— 
WTW: Yes, he was the celebrant. He preached a sermon, “A Knock at Midnight.” 
I remember that. There’s a picture in my room of him putting the hood on me as 
symbolic of my initiation as a pastor of the church. But it was a marvelous experience. 
DC: And his assassination came only eleven days after that. 
WTW: Ten days. 
DC: Ten days after? 
WTW: Yeah. 
DC: Do you remember what was on his mind or talking with him during that 
time? 
19 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0109 
Wyatt Tee Walker and Theresa Walker 
WTW: Not really, because I was in New York, and he was in Memphis. I always 
felt he was asking me to come to Memphis to organize the marches there, for one that had 
gone wrong. 
DC: And after, obviously after, his death, by carrying on in the church, how did 
you see the movement, if you want to call it that, playing out, going forward, from 1968 
forward into the [19]70s? 
WTW: Well, I felt that there was so much residual racism left in the nation, and 
particularly the cities like New York, that the church again could be at the forefront of 
that movement. In New York, we were wrestling with the problem of quality education, 
and I became immersed in the charter school [50:00] movement, which was bandied 
about as to whether it was good or bad, and so forth. But I became a central figure in 
that. In fact, Ruben Gomez, a Spanish pastor in the Bronx, and I led, along with Floyd 
Flake, the struggle to get charter school legislation in the state of New York. I opened, 
with a fellow named Steve Klinsky, I opened the first charter school in New York. I 
don’t remember the year, but it’s been ten years ago, and it’s been doing very well. 
DC: So education was a major— 
WTW: It was a major issue. 
DC: You also mentioned drugs, and I know that you became very interested in 
South African politics and the antiapartheid movement. 
WTW: Well, parallel to my struggle in the South, Dr. King had been very vocal 
about the apartheid movement. I was recruited by people from the national, American, 
the [African] National Congress, ANC, Johnstone Makatini, and so I mobilized churches 
into a three-hundred-member federation to get the truth out about apartheid. I actually 
20 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0109 
Wyatt Tee Walker and Theresa Walker 
worked in the election of [Nelson] Mandela becoming president. I participated in two, on 
two continents in the struggle against racism, Union of South Africa and the United 
States. 
DC: Do you see this as all connected, as a global struggle? 
WTW: Oh, yes. Hatred is a terrible disease, and racism goes with the hatred of 
one people against another, usually the downtrodden. So I have a theological position as 
well as a practical political position. 
DC: As you were talking about practical politics—yeah? 
Female 2: Ask him to talk a little bit more about those, his positions. 
DC: OK, yeah. If you could just expand a little bit, talk a little bit more about 
those positions. 
WTW: Well, because I was involved in the apartheid movement, anti-apartheid 
movement, I got to go to South Africa several times. One time I took twenty-two 
ministers to be on the ground to see what apartheid was really like. The indigenous 
South Africans could not own land, could not live where they wanted to, they had to 
carry passbooks with their identity. It was a terrible form of racism. It was systemized in 
the Reform Church, and that went from that practice to legislation. So there was a 
political solution, and I joined that. 
DC: And you said you had your theological stance as well. Can you tell us 
about that? 
WTW: Well, the theological position is grounded in the New Testament 
philosophy and teachings of Jesus. I forget the gentleman who was writing a book on the 
making of a mind about Dr. King. He asked me, “Whose writings influenced Dr. King 
21 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0109 
Wyatt Tee Walker and Theresa Walker 
the most?” I said, “Well, what answers have you received?” and he told me Martin 
Buber, and the fellow who was at Walden Pond. 
DC: Emerson? 
Male 1 : [Henry David] Thoreau. 
DC: Thoreau. 
WTW: Yes, Thoreau, and [Paul] Tillich. They named the— 
DC: Niebuhr [55:00], 
WTW: The elite theologians... Well, I told them Dr. King was influenced mostly 
by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. And Ansbro said he had not received that answer 
from anybody. But more than anything else, Martin Luther King was a Christian pastor, 
and it was his commitment to the Jesus paradigm that our movement got its strength and 
its theology. 
DC: The beloved community. Can you— 
WTW: Absolutely. 
DC: —speak about that concept? 
WTW: Well, that comes out of the Jesus faith that black people have and 
articulated by people like Martin Luther King, and Vernon Johns, and Gardner Taylor, 
and others like them. 
DC: And a continuous struggle to achieve. 
WTW: Oh, absolutely. Evil is persistent, and you have to fight it persistently. 
When Obama got elected president, the media and the pundits began to talk about the 
post-racial era, but there is no post-racial era. There’s so much residual racism that it’s 
hardly changed for some people. 
22 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0109 
Wyatt Tee Walker and Theresa Walker 
DC: Let me ask the room if there are any questions others would like to ask at 
this point. 
Male 2: Well, I would like for you to—pardon. 
Female 2: I think he’s getting tired. 
F3 : One last question. 
DC: Fll just ask a couple more questions. Is that good? 
WTW: Mm-hmm. 
Male 1 : The—you’re rolling back and forth a little bit, which is fine. 
Female 2: That means he’s not hearing it. 
Male 1 : I know, I know that. 
F3: That’s OK. 
Male 1 : Just be aware of it. 
F3 : That’s OK. We’re about to wrap up. 
DC: OK. 
Male 2: I think a question about where Dr. Walker had alluded to the failure 
of Memphis’s campaign. You may want to follow up to find out what those failures were 
in Memphis. I think that would be important. 
DC: Of Memphis or in Albany? 
Male 2: You haven’t done that one yet. 
DC: No, in Memphis. 
Male 2: Dr. Walker was asked—you asked him the question about—Dr. King 
had perhaps wanted Dr. Walker to come to Memphis because— 
DC: OK, right, right, sorry. 
23 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0109 
Wyatt Tee Walker and Theresa Walker 
Male 2: —of the failures in Memphis. It would be good to know. I’ve 
heard very few people talk about that. 
DC: OK, great. Any other questions? Just you? OK, terrific. So just two final 
questions then. One is, the Reverend was alluding to something you had mentioned 
earlier about Dr. King calling you, perhaps calling you to Memphis, because of the 
difficulties and failures in Memphis. What were the [failures]? 
WTW: Well, the march that they had in Memphis was disrupted by—I think they 
had a—the nickname was “the invaders,” but they were put up to it by the FBI. So it 
couldn’t be—it had to be straightened out, and I think that Dr. King wanted some help 
with that. But the federal government has been complicit again and again with trying to 
disrupt our movement and its direction, particularly the Kennedy administration. 
DC: What did you think of Dr. King’s move towards jobs? I mean, it had been 
there from the beginning, of course, but at that period of really trying to focus on 
economic issues. 
WTW: That was one of the issues that rose out of the hatred that racism creates. 
The lack of meaningful employment, poor schools, and not having enough verve and 
energy to impose strict accountability, with the Voting Rights Act. There was always an 
attempt to [1:00:00] dilute it, and it goes on. 
DC: So I just want to ask, as a final question— and, first, let me just, again, say 
thank you so much for your time. This has just been amazing to hear from you today. 
We really appreciate it, and the American public will appreciate this at the Smithsonian. 
I want to ask you. I know you’ve done many, many, many interviews like this, and I 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0109 
Wyatt Tee Walker and Theresa Walker 
wonder if you ever leave those interviews thinking, oh, I wish, if there’s one thing I just 
didn’t get to say or one thing you didn’t ask about. I wonder if there’s something— 
WTW: No. My style is to tell the truth, and I just do that all the time. My mentor, 
Dr. Vernon Johns, used to say that the truth is always inflammatory, so I’m wedded to 
that. 
DC: Well, we thank you for it. 
WTW: You need to interview my wife. 
DC: We do. 
WTW: She’s the only genuine wife of one of the icons of the civil rights that 
exists. They had a book out not so long ago, a couple of years, about the women of the 
movement, and they didn’t include her. It made me furious. But she was a Freedom 
Rider. She’s been beaten with a rifle butt of an Alabama state highwayman, and our 
house has been assaulted, both with guns and rocks. In Petersburg, they shot out the 
lights on the parsonage and threw something through the front window. And she has 
lived through all of that and been sweet and understanding and supported me, told me 
what to do. The key to a long marriage is the husband must have the last word in his 
household. “Yes, dear.” [Laughter] 
Male 2: That’s a true word there. 
DC: Well done. Well said. [Laughter] 
WTW: Honey, I think you ought to share with them your experience on Mother’s 
Day, 1963, before and after. 
Theresa Walker: The Saturday before Mother’s Day in 1963, my husband 
was supposed to come home for Mother’s Day, and Dr. King asked him to stay in 
25 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0109 
Wyatt Tee Walker and Theresa Walker 
Birmingham because someone had bombed A. D. King, Dr. King’s brother’s home, and 
the people were rioting because they had gotten tired of the assaults on the black 
community. My husband couldn’t come home, so he asked me to bring the four children 
to Birmingham. While he was out trying to quiet the crowd, the Birmingham national 
guardsman had asked us to go into the lobby of the Gaston Motel. Two of my children 
were sleeping in the hotel, in the lobby, in the hotel. I didn’t go into the lobby until I got 
my children, and I said, “I have two children asleep in the motel.” A national guardsman 
struck me in the head and sent me to the hospital. I said I wouldn’t go to the hospital 
without my children, and we went to the hospital, and I stayed there until the next 
morning. When I left the hospital I wanted to go back to Atlanta. I was through with 
Birmingham. So the children and I went back to Atlanta. When we got to Atlanta— 
WTW: East Point. 
TW: We were two blocks into East Point, which is where the Atlanta airport is, 
a policeman pulled up beside me and said, “What do you do when you see the police 
sirens?” I said, “You pull over.” He said, “Well, you didn’t pull over, so follow me.” I 
followed him to the jail. My oldest child was eleven. They arrested my el even-year-old, 
the ten-year-old, the nine-year—eight-year-old, and the six-year-old. We stayed there. 
Well, I asked them if I could have my one phone call, and they said yes. I called Daddy 
King, but he had left the church [1:05:00], and I didn’t know where else to call him, so I 
called Andy Young’s wife, Jean, and told her to get in touch with Dr. King. Oh, they told 
me I’d used my one phone call, and I said, “Well, can my daughter have her one phone 
call?” and they told me yes, so that’s how I called Jean Young. Jean Young and Edwina, 
my husband’s secretary, came out to the jail, and they told them we were not there. But 
26 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0109 
Wyatt Tee Walker and Theresa Walker 
they had already gotten in touch with Daddy King, and about midnight Daddy King came 
out with someone who owned his property, because you had to own your property 
outright. You couldn’t have a mortgage on it. That gentleman made bail for me. I had to 
have a trial, and they called me the day before to come to court the next day, they said, or 
the gentleman who had put up my bond would lose his bond. I got some of the 
schoolteachers to take care of my children, and I went out to the jail, to the trial. They 
fined me $84, and I said, “Well, I’m not going to pay it,” so they put me in jail again, but 
the jail was nice and clean, and I said, “This is my chance to get a good rest.” I stayed 
there until my husband and Bob Brown were coming through, coming in from Atlanta, 
coming through East Point, and my husband saw my car, and he said, “I know my wife is 
in jail out here.” Bob Brown came in and paid my $84 fine and got me out of jail. So 
that’s what happened in East Point, Georgia, after I left Birmingham, Alabama, on 
Mother’s Day in 1963. 
WTW: At the same time, I went to the motel to pick up her things, and the 
Alabama highway patrolman, when they identified me, they began to beat me, three of 
them. They broke my wrist, three ribs, three fractured ribs, and they dislocated a disc in 
my spine with their batons, so it was a terrible weekend for us as a family. But she’s 
been very brave. She went to Mississippi as a Freedom Rider, not—I think we were the 
only couple that went. She was in a cell for two people with fourteen other women. 
Female 2: Did they place her children in jail with you, or were they in 
separate— 
TW: They just put us together. 
WTW: They figured the whole family must be desperados. 
27 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0109 
Wyatt Tee Walker and Theresa Walker 
Female 2: Is there anything else that you’d like for her to share with us? 
WTW: Well, just to say that she’s always been supportive. I find time or made 
time to write books, and she’s read all my books before—I have thirty published books, 
and she’s read all the manuscripts before they’re published. She’s been helpful to me in 
my journalistic pursuits, and I now have thirty published, and I have about thirty more to 
be published. I have written fifty-five books at last count. 
TW : I want to say one, give you one other incident that hasn’t been told. When 
my—when we lived in Petersburg, and my husband was president of the Petersburg 
Improvement Association, he was president of CORE, he was president of the SCLC, and 
he was well known as an agitator. When my daughter got ready to go to school, she was 
barred from all public schools because of his work in Petersburg. There was a pupil 
placement form that you must sign that you would not send your child to a white school. 
I didn’t plan to send my child to a white school, but I didn’t want to sign the pupil 
placement form. We did not sign it, so she was barred from all public schools. The 
teachers in Petersburg who belonged to our church and some other teachers gave me a 
lesson plan every evening [1:10:00], and I was able to homeschool before homeschooling 
was even popular. I home schooled my daughter. My daughter finished Howard 
University in three years. She did a three-years master’s at Yale, and so we are very 
proud of her, in spite of all that Petersburg did to keep her out of school. 
WTW: She became the deputy director of the National Endowment of the Arts in 
the federal government. She’s about to retire November 1 of this year. 
28 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0109 
Wyatt Tee Walker and Theresa Walker 
Female 2: I want to ask one last question. In looking back over your 
involvement in the civil rights movement, is there anything that you would have done 
differently? 
WTW: Not I. There were times when I used to think about getting vengeance, 
revenge, but the Lord has moved that from my heart, and Fm not bitter. There was a 
time when I was very bitter, but Fm not bitter now. 
TW : No, I just think the [19]60s was an exciting time to be alive. If I could 
have done more, I would have done more, but I had the four children, so I did what I 
could. Fm sure there are other people who no one knows about who have done much 
more than I did. 
WTW: I don’t know how. [Laughter] 
TW : Well, some gave their lives, you know. 
Female 2: Well, Dr. Walker and Mrs. Walker, again, I thank you for granting 
us this interview. 
WTW: I know one little tidbit that you don’t know. Maya Angel ou used to be on 
my staff, and she ran a fundraising office in New York on 125th Street, a great lady. 
Male 2: Tell the story, Doc, when she came to—I think she came to Harlem, 
and you and Dr. King were there, and she said that you were—. 
WTW: Oh, in her book, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, they had—someone 
told me, or Fred Wilkerson was the first one who told me, she went to a rally at [Mount 
Aery?] Church and saw me with Dr. King and said I was too young for wisdom and too 
handsome for virtue. [Laughter] 
Female 2: Wow. That sounds like her. 
29 
AFC 2010/039: CRHP0109 
Wyatt Tee Walker and Theresa Walker 
TW : Like her. 
Female 2: Let’s stop it. [Laughter] [Applause] 
Male 1 : Thank you so much. 
Female 2: Thank you again. 
[Recorder is turned off and then back on.] 
Female 1 : This has been a presentation of the Library of Congress and the 
Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture.
