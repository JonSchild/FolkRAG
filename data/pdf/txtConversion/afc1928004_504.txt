BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH Or CHARLES H. 
DUPREZ. 
The well-known minstrel manager, Chits. H. Duprez, was born at Paris, 
France, March 14th, 1830, and when but a 
child came with his parents 
to America, settling in Canada, where his father became extensively 
-.ngaged in shipping grain, and river navigation between Montreal and 
"iiebec. 
In 1837, the family moved into the United States. 
From 1839 
to 1347 Mr. Duprez was being educated both in the English and French 
languages, and in 1843 he was apprenticed for five years to a 
merchant 
tailor. 
After serving that time, and coming to the conclusion that the 
business did not suit him, he r•solved to start out into the world and fine 
some business more in accordance with his tastes ; so, in 1652, he coa-
nected himself with Cade and Greene's New Orleans Minstrels, New 
Orleans, La., as agent and general director, taking a 
one-third interest in 
the concern, with the understanding that he was to be the moneyed 
man, backing the company as long as he remained with it. The company 
was then thoroughly organized under the title of Cade, Duprez and 
Greene's New Orleans Minstrels, and travelled throughout the country 
for two years, meeting with encouraging success. 
They closed their 
season at Portsmouth, N. H., July 4th, 1856. when John Carle withdrew 
from the company, which was reorganized for another tour, and known 
as Shorey, Duprez and Greene's New Orleans Minstrels. 
In 1853, at 
Vicksburg, Miss., the partnnship was again dissolved, Shorey with-
drawing 
The troupe was again immediately reorganized, under the 
title of Duprez and Greene. 
In 186:3, at Green Bay, Wis., the firm of 
Duprez and Greene was dissolved, Mr. Duprez purchasing Mr. Greene's 
interest in the company. The company has travelled for years with 
uninterrupted success. 
In 1870 Mr. Duprez took the entire company of 
twenty-eight people from Philadelphia. Pa., to San Francisco, Cal., and 
return, at a 
cost of $ 19,750, and rented the California Theatre, in the 
latter city, at an expense of (310,000 gold, for four weeks. The receipts 
on the opening night, Monday, August 6th, reached the sum of $ 1,965.75, 
and during their first week's performances hundreds were nightly 
turned from, the doors unable to gain admission. 
After closing their 
season there, they made a 
tour into the interior of the State, playing to 
large audiences during three weeks. These annual tours include the 
principal cities of the United States, the Canadas, and the Provinces of 
New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. Mr. Duprez i,has been 
connected with the above troupe twenty-six years, and has travelled 
with it all that time, save a 
period of fourteen months, when they were 
located at Philadelphia, Pa. He is highly esteemed, both by the pro-
fession to which he is attached and the public generally, and his success 
may be pronounced as fully deserved, he having been 0112 of the most 
enterprising managers in his calling. 
His word is as good as a 
bond, 
and the public know it; hence the popularity and success that he now 
enjoys. 
It has taken years to establish the troupe; capital and tact com-
bined with managerial skill to keep it constantly before the public, and 
to make ! t 
a 
source of revenue to its gentlemanly directors.

OLD AUNT HANNAH. 
Sung by Jonm FortsEs. 
Oun old man went in to swim, 
Hung his clothes on a 
hickory limb, 
The limb it broke, and he fell in, 
Slap into the water. 
The old man for me did shout, 
For to come and pull him out, 
I 
grabbed the old man by the snout, 
And busted his suspenders.

0, Hannah Jane I 
0, Plieebe Jane! 
Look out for old aunt Hannah 
Flamm, scarum, huukey doo, 
What's the matter now with you ? 
Killy go, Killy go, hi-go-shoo, 
Aunt Hannah's come to town. 
Our old man has got some rum, 
Says that he'll have lots of fun, 
Says he'll go to Washington 
To see the President. 
The old man fell in the old hog pen, 
The old hog she did root him then, 
He says, " old woman, you snoring 
He thought it was aunt Hannah.

Sang by Fa/am Duxobrr. 
THE sunset, my darling, is now on the waters, 
The hour is nigh when from you I 
must go; 
But true to my colleen I'll come o'er the ocean, 
Back to the land where the shamrock does grow. 
Keep back your tears, love, and whisper your kind words, 
Soon we'll be parted, but, darling, I 
know, 
You ne'er will forget me, tho' waves roll between us, 
Your image will follow wherever I 
go. 
cHonrs. 
You never will forget me, though waves roll between us, 
Your image will follow wherever I 
go; 
But true to my colleen I'll come o'er the ocean, 
Back to the land where the shamrock does grow. 
When o'er the ocean 'mid strangers I 
wander, 
Think of my sadness I 
felt day by day; 
That you cannot cheer me, for you can't be near me, 
But time, then, my darling, must soon pass away. 
Then with my heart throbbing wildly with pleasure, 
Safe in your arms, love, again ne'er to go; 
Then will our days be the bright days of sunshine, 
Safe in the land where the shamrock does grow. 
You never will forget me, eta. 
FUNNY SIGHTS. 
Wo.-ds by Faamx DUMONT. Sung by Tom WaitrIELD. 
I'VE got a 
little song to sing, so open wide your ears, 
tell you of the funny sights I've seen these many 
years ; 
I 
saw a 
bullfrog on a 
fence with an elephant playing tag, 
A 
little dog with his tail so short a 
stump tail he couldn't 
wag, 
I 
saw a 
brickbat hit a 
goat with a 
piece of sour krout, 
I 
saw an egg that hatched a 
mule on a 
spittoon inside out, 
I 
saw enough to make me laugh when I 
saw a 
greenback 
dollar 
Take home a 
drunken pair of boots and a 
policeman by 
the collar. 
Perhaps you think I 
haven't seen a 
hair-pin rule a 
horse, 
Or see a 
steamboat go ashore to drink benzine, of course. 
I 
seen a 
camel chase a 
flea up a 
sour apple tree, 
And play draw poker with an owl so old he couldn't see. 
I 
seen a 
hog whose head was bald, around his head he 
wore a 
wreath, 
I 
saw a 
bedbug dressed in red with a 
bran new set of 
teeth, 
I 
saw a 
cart wheel in a 
mince pie, and a 
man who never 
wakes, 
And when I 
drank -Some old benzine I 
saw- a 
thousand 
snakes. 
I 
saw a 
sardine smoke a 
pipe,. and a 
wash-tub go to bed, 
I 
saw a 
donkey with boxing-gloves standing on his head, 
A 
dish cloth drink a 
pail of milk, and a 
lobster that would 
not die, 
A 
butterfly with real blonde hair, a 
rat with a 
glass eye. 
I 
seen a 
mosquito kill a 
hog by stepping on his ear, 
I 
seen a 
whale take a 
bath in a 
penny glass of beer, 
But the funniest thing I 
ever saw, I. remember it to this 
day, 
Was a 
grasshopper without any teeth chewing a 
bale of 
hay. 
MY PRETTY IRISH QUEEN-
Sung by LIMIMI.D and Joza-s. 
How happy is the evening 
When the moon o'er the hill- tops 
And the dew is softly falling 
To lull the flowers to sleep. 
It is then mem'ry's stealing 
Back to a 
happy scene; 
Of one I 
never will forget, 
Is my pretty little Irish queen. 
THORITS. 
Oh ! my pretty little Irish queen, 
Whoever happy seems ; 
With golden hair and eyes so fair, 
This pretty little Irish queen. 
Oh I 
my pretty little Irish queen. 
The fairest ever seen; 
It was hard to part 
From the darling of my heart, 
My pretty little Irish queen. 
Her eyes are like the dew-drops 
That glitter on the rose so bright; 
And teeth just like the lilies, 
Which bloom so fair and white. 
When the shades of night have fallen 
Her face then haunts my dream; 
But there's a 
day when I'll return 
And claim my Irish queen. 
Oh my

LOOS OUT FOR Pill 
Words and music by FRAME Dtroivr, specially for 'Laker PTEASOZt. 
TATrrr. many young girls I'm troubled with beaux, 
Who often will stroll to our gate; 
Bt pa is so queer that he will not allow 
My charmers to linger too late; 
He threatens them all, in spite of ray tears; 
I'm afraid that he'll drive them away, 
So I 
steal to the gate and a 
warning I 
give 
In a 
whisper I 
cautiously say— 
cuor.us. 
Look out for pa I Look out for pa I 
Pa may be watching from a 
room overhead; 
Look out for pa! don't come too far, 
Wait till the old folks have gone up to bed. 
Charles is the nicest of lovers who call, 
I'm afraid he's too reckless and bold; 
He swings on the gate, and it makes such a 
noise, 
But all I 
can do is to scold. 
His arms are too free, for he holds me do tight, 
And I 
try bard to struggle away; 
He kisses me, too; now what can I 
do, 
But to whisper and angrily say— 
Look out for pa. eta.

MY DEAR LITTLE JESSI.Z. 
Sang by DANIEL Una. 
M Y 
dear little Jessie, come sit by side, 
And sing that sweet song once again; 
Your voice full of gladness ray poor heart will cheer 
And joy in my bosom will reign. 
Oh I 
sweet is the' glance of those pretty brown eyes, 
Your cheek like the rose newly blown; 
Far brighter than stars in the heaven above, 
My dear little Jessie, my own. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! Jessie, my darling, thou bright, guiding star. 
None fairer than thee ever shone ; 
Oh! may all sweet adgels watch over and bless 
My dear little Jessie, my own. 
The beautiful robin is warbling his tune, 
- 
The humming-birds flirt through the air; 
The clear rippling streamlet goes murmuring by. 
All nature to-day seems so fair. 
But midst all this garden of nature I 
see, 
Just one tender flower alone; 
More fair than the lily, the queen of my heart. 
Illy dear little Jessie, my own. 
Oh I 
Jessie, my darl4s.g. et*

PZURT e Co., Boston, Mass. 
r3,1 floating along on de wings of peace, 
I 
feel just as slippery as axle grease; 
Go tell Ulysses to fetch along Saul, 
There's lots of room for the short and tall. 
We'll pass you in, it won't cost a 
cent, 
No landlord around to collect the rent; 
It's free to all to examine de ground, 
Don't dodge de hat when it's passed around. 
CHORUS. 
Come, join de huckleberry picnic, 
It's going to take place to-day; 
I'se on de committee to invite you all. 
I 
ain't got long to stay. 
The wicked stands in a 
slippery place, 
A 
good man always holds au ace; 
If you cross the river put on your gown, 
Swim like a 
fish and you'll surely drown. 
A 
policeman's like a 
wicked sin, 
If you don't look out he'll swoop you in; 
Denounce dishonesty of every sort, 
But steal like an artist, don't get caught.

THE HARBACK SISTERS. 
Sung by LBOICARD and Jos. 
WE 
got a 
day off to see our beaux, 
They live in yonder cot; 
Oh! they're the idol of our hearts, 
Sweet forget-us-not. 
While walking out the other day 
We met them all by chance; 
We just came around to see if 
They will go to the dance. 
We're going away to leave you. 
We can no longer stay; 
So clear the track, don't pester nit, 
We're going far away. 
CHORUS. 
Hand in hand together 
We'll welt the floor so grand; 
We're Jane and Liza Harback, 
We're the happiest in the land. 
Como out here, you Jimmy, 
Come out here, you John; 
What are you a-driving at 
To keep us here so long ? 
Now, if you do not hurry 
You will lose the chance 
For to come and go with us 
Right clown to the dance. 
We're going away to leave you, 
We can no longer stay ; 
So clear the track, don't pester us, 
We're going far away.

THE ANIMALS' JUBILEE, 
_ 
Sung by Jowl Pontos. 
Tar torn cat went out on a 
spree, 
Met his friend the bumblebee; 
The bumblebee stung him on the back, 
And the old tom cat, he made tracks. 
A 
monkey sat on Bunker Hill, 
Gave the woodchuck a 
sugar pill ; 
That sugar pill it was so strong, 
It killed a 
snake 'bout four miles long. 
CHORUS. 
The Bengal tiger and the big bulldog, 
They got drunk on good egg-nog; 
The bulldog got so awful drunk, 
He went to sleep in the elephant's trunk. 
The mosquito said unto the flea, 
" 
Shoo-fly 
don't you pester me ;" 
And the bed-bug came along that way, 
Says, " How are you off for stamps to-day ?" 
The rat and mouse, they had a 
spree, 
The grasshopper with them took tea ; 
The rat told the mouse he was a 
bloat, 
The cat came along and ate them both. 
The shanghai rooster on a 
bender 
Crowed till he busted his suspender ; 
He busted his mouth from ear to ear. 
Drinking a 
glass of lager beer.

KEEP STUDYING, 
BANJO SOLO. 
Written by FRANK DUMONT for Tom WIRFIXLD. 
Now, Daniel was in the lion's den, 
And he nearly lost his breath; 
If my mother-in-law was in that den, 
She'd talk them lions to death. 
Lot's wife was a 
trusty body, too, 
She'd go and tattle the news, 
But she was turned into a 
pillar of salt, 
Away up in Syracuse. 
What makes this earth revolve and turn, 
While ever solid on the ground ? 
It's like a 
grindstone with a 
crank, 
And niggers turning it around. 
In old Noah's ark there was a 
pair 
Of animals from land and sea ; 
Now, tell me where did he put the big whale, 
The polecat and the flea ? 
Who made the railroads and steam-engine, 
Who made the telegraph ? 
'Twas the man that kept a 
studying, 
'You bet two dollars and a 
half. 
Who stole into that chicken-coop, 
Grabbed a 
chicken and off did run ? 
That man had better keep studying 
About that farmer's loaded gun.

DARLING, AWAKE FROM THY DREAMS, 
Sung by DANIEL DEM-
Published by BAL-ItEn and Wzmu, St. Louis, Mo. 
CoALE to the window, my darling, 
Why don't you answer my call ? 
Lone birds are calling their mates, love, 
Home as the shadows do fall. 
Under thy window I'm waiting, 
Give me the smile that I 
seek; 
Longing thy face to behold, love, 
I 
list for the answer you speak. 
Come to the window, my darling, 
Give me the smile that I 
seek ; 
Come to the window, some to the window. 
Eager I 
wait for the answer you speak. 
Nature's preparing to slumber, 
Moonbeams are silv'ring the stream; 
Bells in the village are chiming, 
Darling, awake from thy dreams. 
Come to the window and meet me, 
Faithful I 
wait and remain ; 
Praying to see you appear, love, 
And behold you, my darling, again. 
Come to the window, etc.

I'LL tell you of a 
nice young man, 
And of a 
maiden gal; 
The neighbors called him Squinty Dan, 
And she long-legged Sal. 
They lived down on Centre street, 
And loved each other well; 
And it's of a 
dismal history, 
That now I'm going to tell. 
Now, Squinty Dan be had red hair, 
And looked two ways for Monday, 
He peddled clams about the street 
On every day but Sunday. 
But Sundays Squinty Dan would go 
To court long-legged Sal, 
And take her to ride iu his clam-barouche 
On the banks of Gowanus canal. 
•He used to feed her on clam-soup, 
Clam-chowder and clam- pie ; 
And send her lots of long-necked clams 
For her to roast and fry, 
Till the neighbors' gals, through jealousy 
Made up a 
horrid plan 
To freeze the love in the bosom of 
Her darling Squinty Dan. 
When Squinty Dan heard the news, 
He climbed to a 
chimney-top; 
He pulled a 
pound of powder out, 
And down he let it drop. 
It flashed up with a 
fearful roar, 
And Wowed him up so far on high, 
He never came down—and that is the last 
Of this mournful history. 
DON'T SLAM THE GARDEN GATE. 
As sung by HARRY PrEnsorr, &Islet:411e Prima Donna. 
Now, Charlie, promise not to laugh, 
The boon of you I 
pray; 
Or treat it all as silly chaff 
What I 
am about to say. 
Well, you must know that ev'ry night 
You leave so very late, 
And something do that is not right— 
You slam the garden gate. 
CHORUS. 
Please shut it gently to 
When we have said adieu; 
I 
fain would beg of you, 
This little favor do. 
For some one's sure to catch 
The clicking of the latch, 
To know who goes so late, 
Who slams the garden gate. 
The clock struck twelve of course, you know, 
When last we said good-night; 
For while we two were talking so, 
Time flew with rapid flight. 
It was but only yesterday 
My teasing sister Kate 
Said, I 
heard some one go away 
Who slam'd the garden gate. 
CHORUS. 
Then, Charlie, please, to- night, 
Indeed, I 
think you might, 
Just pull it gently to 
When we have said adieu. 
For some one's sure to catch 
The clicking of the latch, 
To know who goes so late, 
Who 
slana'cl the garden gate.

LATHER VERSUS LOVE. 
Sang by Jonx SEARIZEI. 
Ain—" Sam Johnson." 
I'LL sing of a 
clarkey that used to live here, 
He was a 
melodious sweet-scented coon; 
His hair was curly, his heels double-jointed, 
He was brigadier-chief in a 
barber saloon. 
Every morning to see him a 
handling the razor, 
Folks they'd gather in crowds round the door; 
They'd all exclaim when he slapped on the lather, 
Such a 
sweet-scented barber they'd ne'er seen before. 
There was a 
sweet-scented damsel named Sally Magundi, 
Provost Marshal was she in a 
kitchen close by ; 
And she'd pass by the shop as she went to the market, 
And in at the barber she'd throw a 
sheep's eye. 
And the barber he'd wait until she'd return, 
And then to the door he quickly would run, 
And a 
box of pomade he'd slip in her basket, 
Then drink to her health in a 
pint of bay rum. 
A 
little Dutch butcher, his name was Hans Schmid, 
He heard of the barber, so jealous he grew; 
He loaded a 
bladder with kidneys and doughnuts, 
Then straight for this sweet-scented barber he flew. 
The battle commenced—the slaughter was awful, 
They with murder intent at each other did rush. 
But the barber he soon got the best of the butcher, 
For he blew out. his Vrain4 with a

RIVAL FROGS. 
Words by Fneorm DUMONT. Sung by Tom Warerrztv. 
THERE was a 
little frog that lived in a 
swamp, 
And a 
hunkey little frog Was he ; 
He'd it on a 
stump in the glimmer of the moon, 
And wink at an owl in the tree. 
He fell in love with a 
fat widow frog, 
But a 
rival soon came around, 
A 
cross-eyed frog with corns on his feet, 
Who sang bass from a 
hole in the ground. 
This hunkey little frog soon jealous got, 
He commenced to grieve and to fret, 
For the cross-eyed frog would skirmish in the fain, 
To the widow's house, you bet. 
But this frog on the log did wait one night, 
Smashed his snoot and then he dusted, 
The cross-eyed frog took a 
dose of fusil oil, 
He swelled up like a 
bladder and busted. 
The hunkey frog then went on a 
bust, 
And drank a 
gallon of lager beer, 
He got entangled and fell in a 
heap, 
For his stomach felt so queer. 
A 
big buck nigger came that way, 
And this frog he soon espied, 
He scratched on the back of his head, 
And pe;:led off all his hide.

BouvAR BILL was a 
peanut man, 
And he had a 
lovely daughter, 
With eyes that looked like oyster shells, 
And nose as flat as a

Her feet was full of bunions, 
Uer mouth was as wide as the Erie canal, 
And her breath was as sweet as onions.

And a

With government shoes, about nineteen, 
With a

And a 
big tin pan for a 
diamond pin, 
And a 
ham-bone in her pocket.

That you are a 
little queer, 
And I 
think the best thing you can do, 
Is slide off on your ear. 
She fell in love with a 
nice young man, 
And tried his heart to slaughter, 
His hair was red, his teeth were loose, 
And he peddled chalk and water. 
He used to drive a

With eyes that folks call gugle, 
And when he went to see his girl, 
He whistled Yankee Doodle.

W HY am I 
thus forgotten, love ? 
Why leave me to repine 1 
Why take away the hopes, love, 
The dreams that once were mine ? 
Has absence caused you to forget 
The vows that once were made ? 
The clouds are gathering near me, 
The sunlight now will fade. 
Am I 
banished from thy heart, love ? 
Why leave me to repine ? 
Why take away the hopes, love, 
The dreams that once were mine ? 
Why am I 
thus forgotten, love ? 
Why leave me thus in tears ? 
The brightest hopes I 
cherished 
Are like the by-gone years, 
Never to return again 
Unless you smile on me. 
Oh! speak to me and tell me 
That I 
am dear to thee.

THE THIN NAN. 
BANJO SOLO. 
Written for Tom W ARFIRLD, by FnAms Buxom?. 
Tan thinnest man I 
ever saw, 
Lived over in Hoboken; 
When I 
tell you all how thin he was, 
You'll think that I 
am joking. 
In a 
key-hole he would often creep, 
Thro' a 
sieve he'd go a 
sliding, 
But when the landlord came for rent 
In the gas pipe he'd be hiding. 
CII011US. 
Tissue paper's very thin, 
So's a 
porous plaster, 
This man he got as thin as gauze, 
He couldn't get thin any faster. 
He never went out on a 
windy day, 
And when he went out alone, 
All the dogs would follow him, 
Thinking he was a 
bone. 
One night, while he was sleeping, 
The candle was burning dimly, 
A 
bed-bug grabbed him by the neck, 
And pulled him up the chimney. 
CHORUS. 
He was as thin as milk in a 
bad hotel, 
Or the skin of a 
new potato. 
For exercise he'd take a 
dive 
Through the boles of a 
nutmeg grater. 
One thy, while he was prowling, 
In a 
bakery he did go ; 
The bak-n7 threw him in the trough, 
And mixed him with the dough. 
They put him in the oven, 
I 
tell you twas amazing, 
They baked him in a 
New Year's cake, 
And passed him off for a 
raisin. 
He was as thin, eto.

Angels bright her happy smile,

Ade, Ade, Ade, 
Such songs will pass away; 
Though the Blue Alsatian Mountains 
Seem to watch and wait always. 
By the Blue Alsatian Mountains, 
Came a 
stranger in the spring, 
And he lingered near the fountain, 
Just to hear the maiden sing, 
Just to hear the maiden sing, 
Just to whisper in the moonlight, 
Words the sweetest she had known. 
Just to charm away the hours, 
Till her heart was all his own. 
Ade, Ade, Ade, 
Such charms must pass away, 
Though the Blue Alsatian Mountains 
Seem to watch and wait always.

THE OLD-FASHIONED CRADLE. 
, 
Published by BALMER and W EBER, St. Louis, Mo. 
Written and sung by FRANK DUMONT. 
On ! the old broken crib's laid aside iu a 
room 
Where the dust almost hides it from view ; 
Oh! 'tis many years ago since it saw the light of day; 
And the old-fashioned cradle then was new. 
Little baby heads have rested slumb'ring in this little bed 
While my mother sang and moved it to and fro ; 
And my sisters and my brothers, whom I 
ne'er shall seo 
again, 
Were rocked in this old cradle years ago. 
CHORUS. 
Rock ! rock ! rock ! mother's voice I 
hear 
Singing baby songs so sweet and low; 
Her loving form I 
see, watching while the baby sleeps, 
And she rocks this little cradle to and fro. 
Oh! I 
love the broken crib for the sake of other days, 
For the sake of my mother gone above; 
Who kissed my eyelids down, and she taught my little 
pray'r, 
'Twas the kiss of my mother's boundless love. 
She often watched beside it to protect us from all harm, 
And with anxious care each motion seemed to be; 
Oh! ' tis sacred for the mem'ries that it brings my lonely 
heart, 
The old-fashioned cradle's dear to me. 
Rock! rock ! rock! etc. 
JUST TO PLEASE THE BOYS. 
As sung by HeurtY Pm:sox, Burlesque Prima Donna. 
SOME people have peculiar ways, 
And I 
have some, I 
know; 
I 
don't like swell society, 
Restraint I 
cannot go. 
I've done and will do as I 
please, 
keep still or make a 
noise ; 
I 
love to please the ladies, but 
Prefer to please the boys. 
SPOKEN. — Oh ! well ! ladies never appear perfect in 
each others' eyes ; 
there is 
always some little fault, 
whether caused by envy, jealousy or otherwise; so on this 
occasion I 
waive female opinion, and intend— 
CHORUS. 
Just to please the boys, 
Just to please the boys, 
I 
always meant with good intent 
To try and please the boys. 
I 
love to sing, to sail and race, 
I 
love to skate and dance ; 
I 
love all social parties 
Where they give a 
girl a 
chance. 
My lady friends find fault because 
They cannot share my joys, 
And tell me I'm too forward 
When I 
try to please the boys. 
Sromc.,7.—Lord, I'm not fickle! I 
do like one man. 
The other evening a 
gentleman kissed me just because I 
let him. 
He repeated the act and then wanted an en-
core. 
I 
refused. 
He said, " My dear, they all do it." 
He didn't mean me. I 
have a 
few kisses left, and when 
I 
distribute them it will be— 
Just to please the boys, etc.

LE MOUNTAIN DAISY. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Words by FRANK DUMONT. 
Music by FEED TUTHITII.• 
IN 
yonder little moss-grown cottage, 
Where beauteous daisies grow, 
A 
little blue-eyed darling's waiting 
With cheeks that are aglow; 
Like the blossom of the roses, 
Like Aurora's brightest beam, 
Her image haunts me night and day, 
In one long pleasant dream. 
CHORUS. 
My love for her I 
must confess, (
break.) 
And ask the folks our love to bless ; (
break.) 
The wedding bells will sweetly chime, 
As hand in hand we stray, 
My mountain daisy will be mine 
Upon that happy day. 
We often talk about the future, 
Build castles in the air; 
I 
fancy that I 
rule a 
kingdom, 
And my little queen is there. 
But I'll ask for nothing more 
Than my darling's love so pure, 
It will outlast all earthly wealth, 
And thro' this life endure. 
- My love for her, etd.

DARLING KATHLEEN IS GONE. 
Sung by DITPREZ and BENEDICT'S 31instrels. 
NEAR the banks of sweet Killarney, 
Where the shamrock's ever green, 
Dwelt a 
pure and lovely treasure, 
She's my darling—sweet Kathleen. 
When the shades of eve were falling, 
We'd wander by the lake; 
And bright did seem the future, 
I 
lived but for her sake. 
CHORUS. 
But when the snows of winter 
Clothed the ground in spotless white, 
'T was then my dearest Kathleen 
Was taken from my sight. 
On the banks of sweet Killarney, 
Where the waters gently sigh, 
'Tis there they laid my darling ; 
She'll awaken by-and-by. 
And the birds they seem to miss her, 
And call her from each tree, 
Go forth, dear little songsters, 
Bring Kathleen back to me.. 
CHORUS. 
But I 
never more shall see her, 
As I 
pass the cottage door ; 
For my darling now is waiting, 
Where we'll meet to part no more.

CALL ME DARLING. 
Sung by H ARRY PIERSON. 
CALL me darling, whisper softly, 
Press thy loving sweet lips near; 
Fold me closer, closer, darling, 
As you breathe it in mine ear. 
same so full of love and sweetness, 
How it thrills one o'er and o'er ; 
speak it softly, sweetly, fondly, 
Call me darling yet once more. 
CHORUS. 
Call me darling, call me darling, 
'Tis the sweetest name I 
know; 
Call me darling, ever darling, 
Whisper softly, breathe it low. 
From thy heart so fondly beating 
Let thy lips the name repeat, • 
O'er my heartstrings softly sweeping 
Cords of love 'and music sweet. 
Soft as breath of summer evening, 
Gently as the falling dew, 
Breathe that name of tender sweetness, 
Telling story fond and true. 
Call me darling, etc. 
Call me darling, only darling, 
Sweetest pet-mime ever known; 
Speak it softly, whisper fondly, 
In love's sweetest, fondest tone. 
I 
will treasure it in secret 
Memory fairest, dearest best, 
In my heart I'll safely fold it 
Like a 
bird within its nest.

STOLEN KISSES ARE THE SWEETESZ 
Sang with great success by the marvellous male soprano 
14.r.irt-
PansoN. 
Now, some may call me bashful, 
But I'll prove that I 
am right; 
We girls should ne'er give kisses, 
Don't treat the matter light ; 
I 
love my Charley dearly, . 
For in my heart I 
feel it; 
But if he asks me for a 
kiss, 
I'll make him try to steal it. 
CHORUS. 
Stolen kisses are the sweetest 
When they're taken on the sly; 
Often you may steal another, 
That is, if there's no one nigh. 
I 
often go to parties 
Where I'm sure to be the belle ; 
I 
listen with attention 
To the tales of love they tell. 
And when the ball is over 
They see me to the door ; 
Then there's a 
chance to steal a 
kiss. 
I 
wish they'd steal some more. 
Stelen kisses, etc.

POMPEY.—Just come down to see the apple of my eye, that 
dear, sweet, bewitching little yellow gal, Lisa Jane! 
Talk 
about your Venuses and such trash! 
You ought to see her. 
Why, she's so sweet, that she can't go out in the fields with-
out a 
veil, for fear of the bees lighting on her, she looks so 
much like a 
walking rose. 
Then she says I'm her darling. 
Hi 
feel like a 
sunfish just caught. I 
can't keep still. 
I 
thina. I 
must be in love. 
That's her cottage, where she lives 
wi"; her ma and pa. I 
wonder if she's home. Oh, my! how 
I 
wouP like to see her; yet my heart beats as if I 
had a 
loco, 
motive and train of cars inside my shirt-front.

Am—" 
Old Kentucky Home." 
The sun shines bright in my old Kentucky home, 
'Tis summer, the darkies are gay;. 
The corn-top 's 
ripe, and the meadows are in bloom, 
And the birds make sweet music all the day. 
The young folks roll on the little cabin floor, 
All merry, all happy and bright ; 
Bimeby hard times comes a-knocking at the door, 
Then my old Kentucky home " good night" 
[1301iPEv listens attentively. 
LISA JANE, at the end of Cv..4

How've you been? How's

LISA JANE.—All well, and lively as crickets. 
POMPEY.—Do

ask the old couple if they'll have me for a 
son-in-law? 
LisA. JANE.-0h, go 'way now! For lie! that's very un-

UNFORTUNATE CUSS. 
Sung by joux SEARLES. 
I'm an unfortunate cuss as ever you did see, 
I 
loved a 
gal, her name it was Sal, but she didn't love me; 
For she had another fellow, and he was a 
regular beat, 
He was chief engineer of a 
peanut stand, and he sold 
them on the street. 
But if over I 
catch that fellow, there's one thing I 
can tell, 
I'll make him look blue, that's what I'll do, and he'll 
wish he was in—well, 
Jerusalem, or some other place, or that he had -never 
been born, 
For I'll knock out his eye with a 
cranberry pie, and give 
him a 
bust in the horn. 
She's fat, ragged, saucy and tall, and she wears a 
big 
waterfall ; 
She's a 
healthy dead beat, and me she did cheat, but I'll 
get nquare for all. 
I 
bought her a 
new set of teeth, and I 
gave her a 
camel's 
hair shawl, 
She looks very neat, all but her big feet, and them she'll 
never make small, 
For she goes out every night, walking with this feller. 
Ice cream and pig's feet every night he will treat, down 
in a 
lager beer cellar. 
But I'm bound to be revenged, for to me he's done 
plenty, 
I'll go and get tight, and I'll kick up a 
fight, on his eye 
I'll put a 
big shanty. 
I'll make her give back them teeth, and everything that I 
bought her, 
She tries to be gay, and she's old enough to chew hay, 
and besides she's a 
fisherman's daughter ; 
She ought to go peddling fish, and live on pump water ; 
She won't have any teeth to chew up her hash, and I 
don't think that she ought to. 
So when she meets this peanut peddler, she can tell him 
what I've done. 
If be comes around here, I'll bite off his ear, and then 
I'll have lots of fun. 
So I 
think the best thing she can do is to start for Salt 
Lake city, 
I'll give her a 
dollar a 
week, and all she can eat, if she 
will kill herself just out of pity.

The musie of this song is published by FREDERICK BLEXE, 861 Broad 
way, New York. 
Price 40 cents. 
You will miss me, darling Chloe, when I 
sleep beneath ths 
sod, 
Where the summer winds are murm'ring o'er the lea; 
You will think of me in kindness, as life's weary road you 
plod, 
When my spirit rests from pain and sorrow free; 
The sands of life are slowly ebbing, darling, with the tide, 
And soon these bones will mingle with the clay ; 
In the winter of your sorrow you will think of how I 
died, 
And you'll miss me, Chloe, when I'm laid away. 
CHORUS. 
For old uncle Tom is feeble, 
And his head is bending low ; 
Master calls, he can no longer stay— 
For his limbs are getting weary 
And his eyes are growing dim, 
But you'll miss me, Chloe, when I'm laid away I 
You will tell our little children that their father dwells 
above; 
How the angels led him up the golden stair, 
You will tell them how I 
lov'd them, with a 
fond and 
sacred love ; 
They must try to meet their poor old father there. 
And when the Judge his trumpet sounds from realms of 
bliss on high, 
And the morning of the great day comes at Last, 
I 
will meet you, darling, Chloe, and together you and I, 
Will no longer dread December's wintry blast. 
For old uncle Tom, etc.

GRANDPA'S chair is vacant, 
Near the fire in the grate, 
Where he told his tales .of boyhood— 
Kept the little ones awake ; 
One eve, so worn and weary, 
Sleeping on his knee they lay, 
Death called that night- —like the fire bright 
Grandpa passed away. 
CHORUS. 
So let the room be cheerful— 
Place the old arm-chair 
Where we talked to grandpa, 
With his silv'ry snow-white hair; 
How he'd watch the falling ashes, 
And sadly meditate, 
Gently sigh, We all must die, 
Like the fire in the grate. 
One bitter night in winter, 
The snow fell fast and wild; 
A 
girl looked in the window— 
A 
careworn, hapless child ; 
Then grandpa whispered, " Baby," 
And toddled to the gate, 
To save from sin he brought her in, 
Near the fire in the grate. 
So let the room be cheerful, et4 
Keep the fire burning, 
'Tis charity's bright flame, 
Reminding of the evening 
The orphan Mary came, 
So ragged, cold, and hungry, 
With grandpa from the gate ; 
For him she kneels, a 
pray'r she yields, 
Near the fire in the grate. 
So let the room be cheerful, etc.

IF I

The Music of this song is published by OLIVER DITSON 
CO., Boston, 
Mass. 
'TWAS up in Central Park, one lovely summer's day, . 
My heart was like a 
lark, the sky was bright and gay ; - 
I 
lingered by the lake that sparkled in the sun, 
And, oh, the pretty birds did make sweet music, everyone. 
But soon I 
saw two eyes that fondly glanced at me, 
They seemed to wander from the skies, they looked so 
lovingly. 
A 
gentle form drew near; she 6miled—was I 
to blame ? 
Oh wouldn't life be dear, if I 
only knew her name ? 
CHORUS. 
If I 
only knew her name, if I 
only knew her name; 
Eyes looked sweetest love, to eyes that looked thG same ; 
Then twilight softly .fell, oh Cupid was to blame ! 
Oh I'd give the world, if I 
only knew her name. 
We saw the swans go by, like little silver ships ; 
I 
heard the sweetest sigh, from luscious, rosy lips ; 
The stars come out at last, and yet I 
could not go. 
How quickly then the moments passed, the heart alone 
can know. 
But soon beside the gate we softly bid adieu, 
For oh the hour 9 
were growing late, and birds were 
dreaming too; 
I 
wonder when we'll meet; my heart is still the same; 
Oh life were angel sweet, if I 
only knew her name. 
If I 
only knew her name, sta.

THE OLD WOODEN ROCKER. 
Words ani music by FLORENCE HARPER. 
The Music of this song is published by . SPEAR and DEnNuorr, 
717 Broadway, New York. 
Price 40 cents. 
THERE it stands in the corner, with its back to the wall, 
The old wooden rocker so stately and tall! 
With naught to disturb it but the duster or broom, 
For no one now uses that back parlor room. 
Oh! how well I 
remember in days long gone by, 
When we stood by that rocker, my sister and I, 
And we listen'd to the stories that our grandma would tell, 
By that old wooden rocker we all lov'd so well. 
CHORUS. 
As she sat by the fire she would rock, rock, rock, 
And we heard but the tick of the old brass clock; 
Eighty years had she sat in that chair grim and tall, 
In that old wooden rocker that stands by the wall, 
if this chair could but speak, oh! the tales it could tell,— 
How poor aged grandpa in fierce battle fell : 
'Neath the stars and the stripes he fought bravely and true, 
He cherisli'd his freedoLn, the red, white, and blue! 
It could tell of bright days and of dark ones beside, 
Of the day when dear grandma stood forth as a 
bride; 
This is why we all love it, this old chair grim and tall, 
The old wooden rocker that stands by the wall. 
As she sat by the fare, etc. 
But poor grand= is acne, and her stories are done,— 
Her children have follow'd her, yes, one by one, 
They have all gone to meet her in the " sweet by-and-by," 
And all that is left is dear sister and I. 
Never more will we hide her gold specs, or her cap; 
Never more will we tease her while taking her nap; 
Never more will she slumber in that chair griixt and tall. 
The old wooden rocker that stands by the wall. 
As she eat by the ire, etig

MEDLEY OF HYMNS. 
Original, by Goss and Fox.

OH, good-evening, white folks, how do you do ? 
Down by the sunrise to play on the golden harp; 
We're pretty well, and how are you ? 
Down by the sunrise to play on the golden harp. 
If religion was a 
thing that the pet:pie had to buy, 
Down by the sunrise to play on the golden harp ; 
Why, de rich man would live and the poor man would die, 
Down by the sunrise to play on the golden harp. 
Then it's glory we are travelling, 
Down by the sunrise to play on the golden harp. 
(Repeat two last lines.) 
Den it's don't get weary, don't get weary, children, 
Don't get weary, for we are going home, by-and-by ; 
Don't get weary, don't get weary, children, 
Don't get weary, for we'll get home, 
By-and-by, oh, we'll get there by-and-by, oh, we'll get

By-and-by, oh, we'll get there and jine dat band in do 
far-off land, 
By-and-by, oh, we'll get there by-and-by, oh, we'll get 
there, 
By-and-by, oh, we'll get up so early in the morning, 
For we're moving two by two, moving two by two, 
Moving two by two, oh, don't you want to go. 
(Repeat two last lines.) 
Go tell all the white folks in the town, 
Oh, I'll meet you dar ; 
Go tell all de colored folks for miles around, 
Oh, I'll meet you der. 
Go tell them that we're gwine to have a

Oh, I'll meet you der ; 
That the old man has come home and happy we will be, 
Oh, I'll meet you dar. 
CHORUS.

To come and dance by de light of de moon ;

THE GOSPEL RAFT. 
Written by FnArm DUMONT. 
Dedicated to Mn. ADCITIE 
gwine to cross the river on de gospel raft, 
Like Noah in de good ole ark; 
Keep your candles all a-burning; keep dem burning all 
de time, 
Or you'll lose yourself and tumble in de dark. 
Get your baggage on de craft, don't forget to get your 
check ; 
You've got to pay your passage right to- day ; 
Be sure de money's good, for de captain's eye is sharp, 
You can't sneak aboard and hide away. 
CHORUS. 
Hide away, hide away; dar's no use trying to hide 
away; 
Get your baggage on de craft, 
Don't forget to have it checked, 
For you can't sneak aboard and hide away. 
Let me tell you about de army Mr. Pharaoh did command 
When he followed ole Moses long ago; 
They was drowned in de water wid their life preservers on, 
And de fishes had a 
jubilee below. 
Dar was Jonah was a 
fool and as stubborn as a 
mule ; 
But de whale he made him quickly disappear ; 
Jonah den pulled out a 
razor and he cut de whale in half, 
And he floated to de shore upon his ear. 
Hide away, etc. 
Now, take warning, little children, don't you fool about 
de raft, 
For de opposition boat is running too ; 
But she's liable to burst her boiler any time at all, 
And you niggers will be cooked into a 
stew. 
I'se got a 
private box and an opera glass to see 
You sinners trying to buzz in at de door • 
But dey'll kick you down de stairs if you 'hasn't got de 
grace. 
If you come back dey'll slap you in de jaw. 
Hide away, et.

A LOCK OF MY MOTHER'S HAIR. 
Written by Fr..t.mt DUMONT. Suing with great success by ELLA ESMOND. 
I'VE a 
letter that was written long ago, 
'Tis a 
letter that I've kept for many years; 
And, oh I 
how oft I've read those fading lines, 
And over them there's traces of my tears. 
She sent to me her blessing in this missive, 
To see me was her constant holy prayer; 
The little lock of gray in this old letter 
Is a 
lock of my angel mother's hair. 
CHORUS. 
I've a 
letter that was written long ago, 
'Tis a 
letter that I 
keep with tender care ; 
The little lock of gray in this old letter 
Is a 
lock of ray angel mother's hair. 
I've a 
letter that was written long ago, 
'Tis a 
missive that was sent me ' cross the sea; 
When 'mong strangers I 
was wand'ring far away, 
And longing home again to ever be. 
But underneath the sod my mother's sleeping, 
She's free from earthly trials and its care, 
But ever next my heart I'll keep her letter, 
And the lock of my angel mother's hair. 
I've a 
letter,

Ant.—" Ten Thousand Miles Away." 
I 
SUPPOSE yes all heard this tune, 
' 
It's ten thousand miles away, 
Pat's no:, the one Pm going to sing 
For that has had its day. 
But I'm going to tell of an Irish girl, 
Who loves me, so they say, ay, ay; 
She's plump and fat as butter, boys, 
And she lives across the way. 
CHORUS. 
My Peg she has blue eyes, 
Her trade is making pies, 
Her cheeks is red, 
And so is her head, 
And she hails from Dublin Bay, ay, ay, 
She is as thick as she is tall, 
And she wears a 
waterfall, 
She's gone on me, that's plain to see, 
My girl across the way. 
Her father is a 
Connaught man, 
Her mother is a 
Tip, 
And she was born in Kerry, 
So yes see she's not a 
Mick ; 
I've told yes all I 
can, me boys, 
For I 
must not delay, ha, ha, 
For this very night I'm to be spliced 
To this girl across the way. 
My Peg, eta. 
BrIt LITTLE ONE'S WATCHING FOR MIL 
Tyt the dell where the brooklet's gently flowing, 
Oa the bench 'neath the old willow tree, 
Where the birds their songs are gently singing, 
My little one's waiting for me, 
And she knows well the sound of my footstep 
As I 
cross o'er the bridge by the lea, 
And I 
hasten with arms stretched to greet her, 
My little one's waiting for me. 
(Repeat last two line.) 
And at night when my daily toil is over, 
And l'tn wending my way towards my home, 
My heart always beating with pleasure, 
For my little one's waiting for me. 
As I 
cross o'er the clear rippling brooklet, 
Their watching I 
always can see, 
On the bench ' neath the old weeping willow 
My little one's waiting for me.

I'M thinking of Erin to- night, 
And the little white cot by the sea, 
Where Jennie my darling now dwells,

My heart ever longs to be there, 
To meet her, my darling, my own, 
Sweet Jennie, the flow'r of Kildare.

Sweet Jennie, the flow'r of Kildare. 
The flow'r of Kildare, the flow'r of Kildare, 
Sweet Jennie, the flow'r of Kildare. 
I'm waiting her sweet face to see; 
While we're parted I 
linger in pain, 
But soon will my heart beat with joy, 
O'er the sea I'll be sailing again, 
Again her sweet kisses of love to receive; 
For her the sea's storms I 
will dare, 
To meet her, my darling, my own, 
Sweet Jennie, the flow'r of Kildare. 
I 
know that she's waiting, etc.
