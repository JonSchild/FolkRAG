Special cars for most things. Cars to bring automobiles in. can put 15-20 on a trailer.  
 
00:14:56 
Now there are a lot of Latinos working. Back then they just did the dirty work. Loading 
grain, coal. White folks had the authority back then.  
 
00:15:50 
 
 
Would have to go down to the ILA. See job posted, details of the times etc. Sometimes 
would take 2-3 days to load the ship.  
 
00:17:23 
Separate locals. Think the Latinos were mixed with the white locals. But would not hire 
that many Latinos. Had two different gangs, Black and white. Ship was divided in half 
between black and white.  
 
00:21:57 
Was one of the  first Latinos to run a locomotive. Some politician was helping the 
Latinos. Wanted to see how many engineers were there. There were no blacks or Latinos. 
He put two blacks and two Latinos on the engine service. Good paying job.  
 
00:23:00 
Run the locomotive, pull the trains, sort the trains out. Ground crew had a list of what 
was to be done and they would tell us. Had 2-3 men on the ground who would do the 
heavy work regardless of how bad the weather. Sometime had to work at 6.30 in the 
morning. Had to get up at 5 and be there by 6am. Sometimes had to start by switching or 
sorting the cars out. Had to work 8-9 hours. and had to be pretty alert. Worked with hand 
signals and at night worked off a lamp. Then the radios came in. ..Once pulled a train 
with 130 loaded cars of grain. Come up the ship channel and go through Manchester 
Terminal to Equity Grain elevator. This was an accident, too much power, four big 
engines. Train broke apart in two places. Couplings came loose. Was not an accident. 
Made a mistake.  
 
00:30:25 
Sometimes the air holes starts leaking and the train comes to a full stop. Have to isolate 
the engine with the problem so the traffic can get by.  
 
00:32:34 
Supply refineries, grain elevators, warehouses to both sides of the Port of Houston. Port 
terminal railroad supplies all the industries from the Turning Basin to Barbers Cut. Big 
grain elevator at Barbers cut.

"Engineer job was good for me." Seamen's job, hardest part of it was being away from 
family for extended periods of time. Made a few trips overseas. Going through the Suez 
canal and back through the Panama canal is called a round the world trip.  
 
00:35:37 
Being a seamen is a rough job. Especially for a married man. Make good money but 
don’t see family for months. Been in Magnolia Park the whole life. Lost two older sons 
and one younger son about 6 years ago. One drowned, the others lost to alcohol.

TX city disaster.  
Was on a boat then and couldn't leave the port because of the disaster. In 1947, was 20 
years old.  
 
00:45:49 
Was raised poor. Did not see any big stores around Magnolia Park. Few people owned 
cars. There was discrimination against Latinos and Blacks. Because of the proximity of 
Magnolia Park to Turning Basin, going to work at the port came naturally. Back then 
very few Latinos worked at the Port. Then got sea-men’s docs and made a few trips in 
early 20's. Stayed at the railroad for 30 years. Did on and off work for longshoreman. 
Describes how to load grain as a longshoreman. Could fill a ship in 2-3 days. Would 
work 10 hr days.  
 
00:50:50 
Did not need technology for that. Just hands and a shovel. Like a big scoop. They would 
pour the grain out. Someone would scoop it to the side. (gestures) 12-14 men would work 
together. "Would work wherever they put you."  
 
00:53:00 
After WW2 discrimination eased up. They were allowed to work at the Port. They were 
even separated at the railroad. There were 2 Latino and 2 black workers at the railroad. 
The rest of them were white. There aren't too many Latinos working at the Port Railroad. 
Mostly white. "They run the show down there."
