ONE Saturday afternoon, 
I 
went to Barnum's show, 
I 
thought I'd die a 
laughing, 
When I 
seen the elephant go. 
You may talk about your funny sights, 
And curious things you see, 
It broke me up, it made me laugh, 
When I 
got to the menagerie. 
CHORUS. 
0, I 
seen a 
big giraffe, ha, ha, 
His neck it made me laugh, ha, ha, 
He looked like an overgrown calf, ha, ha, 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, 
Go to Barnum's show, 
You'll bust your sides I 
know. 
I 
stepped up to the animals' cage, 
And there I 
saw a 
sight ; 
The monkey caught the cat by the tail, 
They commenced to scratch and bite. 
The ape held tight, would not let go, 
The cat did scratch and spit, 
The racoon . 
he played possum, 
0, I 
thought I'd take a 
fit. 
CI-
TORT:S. 
Oh, I 
seen the grizzly bear, ha, ha, 
The monkey pulled his hair, ha, ha, 
It was a 
grand affair, ha, ha, 
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, 
What fun at . 
Barnum's show, 
It makes you laugh, I

Kase it ain't been tuned since way last fall, 
But de darks all say we will hab a

Dey will telegraph de news to Uncle Bacco Juice, 
What a

When we ride up in de chariot in de morn.

But yer golden slippers must be nice and clean, 
And yer age must be just sweet sixteen, 
And yer white kid gloves yer have to wear, 
When yer ride up in the chariot in the morn. 
Oh, dem golden, eta.

THE COLORED HUSKING BALL. 
Words and music by PETTIT and W HITE. 
On, here we are, two pals, 
And we love two yaller gals, 
We first met at the husking of the corn 
And we promised one and all 
That we'd go down to the ball, 
And that's what we are here for now, 
As sure as you rre born. 
CHORUS. 
Then it's oh, ray, won't we have a 
time there, 
Hands around, swing your partner, sashay, balance all. 
Oh, my, won't we cut a 
shine there, 
With Nancy Snow, and Dinah Crow, down at the husking 
ball. 
It isn't every day 
That we have a 
holiday, 
We have to labor hard upon the farm. 
So while we have a 
chance, 
We'll amuse you with a 
dance, 
And white folks tell us that in it 
You cannot find no harm. 
CHORUS. 
Then, it's oh, my, won't we have a 
time there, 
Hands around, swing your partner, sashay, balance all. 
Oh, my, won't we cut a 
shine there, 
With Nancy Snow, and Dinah Crow, down at the husking 
ball. 
DID YOU EVER ? NO, I 
NEVER I 
As sung by NED BARRY, with great success. 
Dm you ever see policemen carry parasols, 
Or the judge on the bench nursing penny dolls ? 
Did you ever know a 
cabman who could never curse, 
A 
Or a 
wedding party ride to church in a 
mourning coach or 
hearse ? 
CHORUS. 
Did you ever, ever know things so very rum ? 
No, I 
never, never did since in this world I've come. 
Did you ever pay your full amount of income tax, 
Or ever see a 
busy bee a-making cobbler's wax ? 
Did you ever know a Welshman who was not named 
Jones ? 
Did you ever eat red herrings that were destitute of bones ? 
Did you ever, etc. 
Did you ever gulp a 
quart of cold drawn castor oil, 
Or with a 
feed of Glentield starch digestive organs spoil ? 
Did you ever wear your socks above your Blucher boots, 
Or walk about with your shirt outside of your ordinary 
suits ? 
Did you ever, etc. 
Did you ever have a 
bath in the Aquarium tank, 
Did you ever try to borrow fourpence at the bank ? 
Did you ever use a 
spokeshave to improve your nose, 
Or sprinkle asaftetida as perfume on your clothes ? 
Did you ever, etc. 
Did you ever don a 
suit of feathers stuck in tar, 
Or ever dance the Highland fling upon the tramway car ? 
Did you ever see a

Or a

rink ?

THE OLD MAN AIN'T HIMSELF NO MORE. 
SONG AND Claours. 
Words by SANUEI. N .

Music by II . P. 
DANES. 
Copyrighted, 187"8, and published by GEORGE W . 
RICHARDSON & Co, 
2.56 Washington Street, Boston, Masi Price :5.5 cents. 
THE old man ain't himself no mo', he's nearly gone to seed, 
And these hands refuse to do the daily toil ; 
I 
never dream'd 'twould come to this, or that I'd be in 
need, 
After years of service in Carlina soil. 
My limbs are bending 'neath their weight, my hair is white 
as snow, 
And I 
cannot see the gentle summer sky ; 
My feet grow weary day by day, my step is weak and slow, 
And I'm gwine to leave my comrades by and by. 
CHORUS. 
The old man ain't himself no mo', he's nearly gone to 
seed, 
And his hands refuse to do the daily toil. 
The old man ain't himself no mo', he's nearly gone to 
seed, 
And his hands refuse to do the daily toil. 
The good old days when I 
was young have flitted like a 
dream, 
And I 
hardly knew that I 
was growing old ; 
I 
never stopped to think how these poor arms of mine 
would seem, 
If the poor old man was left out in the cold. 
But now I 
know the feeling well, it almost breaks my heart 
For to think that I 
must die away from home. 
Oh, if I 
could be young again, to-morrow I 
would start, 
And to old Carlina's shores I'd quickly roam. 
The old man ain't himself, etc. 
I 
long to see the cotton fields, the tall Palmetto trees, 
And to hear the happy darkeys shout and sing ; 
I 
never shall forget the good, the old plantation glees, 
Or the way we used to make the banjo ring ; 
But all is nearly over now, the trumpet soon will sound, 
Then 
have to cross the river over there ; 
And when I 
set my aching feet upon the sacred ground, 
I 
shall know no mo' about this wordly care. 
The old man ain't himself, etc.

CONUNDRUM SONG. 
Written and composed by St W ESTON, and sung by him only with great 
Success. 
THE song which I 
am about to sing, 
Is a 
very funny one; 
I 
am going to crack some funny jokes, 
And tell some conundrums. 
Why are the police of New York 
Like a 
rainbow in the sky ? 
Because they never do show up, 
Until the storms pass by. 
I 
am going to tell a 
riddle now, 
Try and guess if you can ; 
Why are the stars in our American flag 
Like the stars in bright heaven ? 
The answer is an easy one, 
But to you queer may sound, 
There is no power on earth to-day 
To pull our bright stars down. 
Now car conductors do beware, 
If there's any here to-night, 
I 
think they are the biggest beats, 
Although they might be right. 
They sometimes punch you for five cents, 
And still they call it fare ; 
They're sure to give their boss the slip, 
And still they call it square. 
(

CONUNDRUM SONG .—Conclude. 
But now I 
am going to end my song, 
And crack a 
naughtier joke; 
Who was the first man in the world 
That took a 
cab or coach ? 
It was General George Washington, 
Which you all can plainly see, 
It was two hundred years ago, 
He took a 
hack at a 
tree. 
Words by SAM W ESTON. 
Music by Monnts W ESTON. 
IT'S of a 
dark and cold wintry night, 
A 
sad tale I 
will tell ; 
Of a 
mother and her little child, 
The night, I 
remember well. 
The wind did roar like the ocean wave, 
And the snow was falling fast, 
She buried her child into her arms, 
And prayed for her last. 
She strove with all her might and soul, 
Her little babe to save ; 
To have her life and sorrows told, 
When she was in her grave. 
She suffered with the cold and hunger, 
Until her strength did fail, 
She fell asleep to wake no more, 
But her little babe was saved.

LAY MY HEAD BENEATH A ROSE ." 
Composed expressly for, and sung by JOHN RUSSELL, of the Ras-
SELLS, by N ED STRAIGHT. 
DARLING, fold me to you. closer, 
As you did in days of yore; 
Press your lips upon my forehead, 
4 
Ere I 
see the golden shore. 
Life is from me fastly fleeting, 
Soon I'll be in sweet repose ; 
When I'm gone I 
ask this favor, 
Lay my head beneath a 
rose. 
OR 
Us. 
Lay me where sweet flowers blossom— 
Where the dainty lily grows ; 
Where the pink and violets mingle, 
Lay my bead beneath a 
rose. 
Darling one, when first I 
met you, 
When I 
pledged you hand and heart, 
There were roses on your cheeks, love, 
And we vowed we ne'er should part. 
One more kiss, for I 
am going 
Far beyond all earthly woes; 
Let my grave be like your cheeks, love, 
Covered with the blrtsiling rose. 
Lay me where sweet flowers, etc.

ALWAYS,SPEA.K A KIND WORD WHEN YOU 
CAN. 
Sung by NED BARRY. 
AIR. — "Slavery Days." 
STRANGE sayings are the rage, on the street and on the 
stage, 
And many glorious maxims you will fiud; 
4 
But there's one more than the rest seems to linger on my 
breast, 
And very oft comes stealing o'er my mind ; 
I'll sing a 
song to-night of a 
motto true and bright, 
A 
lesson it conveys sublime and grand: 
To the beggar at your door, or any one that's poor, 
Always speak a 
good and kind word when you can. 
Now, there's many a 
man who great riches does command, 
But his praises and his honors they are small ; 
But when he's dead and gone, they'll speak of him and 
mourn, 
And say how good that he had been to all. 
And while upon this earth, struggling hard through life, 
No one would assist him in his plans; 
But his stories they relate when they know it is too late, 
For they never speak a 
kind word when they can, 
The .workingman to-day with his poor and scanty pay, 
Striving very hard his family to maintain ; 
While the rich they stay at home with the riches that they 
own, 
The poor may ask assistance all in vain. 
When humble is your lot in the wretched laborer's cot, 
Don't pass them by, but take them by the hand; 
Don't turn. 
.your head away, but remember what I 
say, 
Always speak a 
good and kind.word when yotfean.

Some recollection be, 
Of days that have as happy been, 
Then you'll remember—

She is handsome, fair and beautiful, so gentle and so tall, 
In fact she takes the shine away from all. 
We met one fine day, it was in the month of May,

W HEN the mocking bird was singing, 
Many months ago, 
And the sweet magnolia blossoms 
Grew as white as snow, 
Then I 
never thought that sorrow, 
Death nor pain would come 
To disturb my oyhood pleasure, 
In that sunny home. 
CHORUS. 
I 
must leave thee, still I 
leave thee, 
Sadly I 
must roam ; 
I 
must leave thee, still I 
leave thee, 
Good-bye, sunny home. 
Roses blossom, violets blooming, 
Round that cottage door, 
Where the birds that sung so sweetly, 
Sing, alas, no more. 
But, oh, my poor heart sinks within me, 
As I 
turn to roam, 
Far from those I 
loved and cherished, 
In that sunny home.

One Horse Bob-Tail Car. 
Written, composed and sung by SAM DEVEME. 
Not long ago I 
went to see 
My sweet Melinda Jane, 
We strolled along the avenue, 
it soon began to rain. 
As from her parient's domicile 
We strayed so very far ; 
To escape the rain we took a 
ride 
In a 
one horse bob- tail car. 
Cuoitus. 
Oh, what a 
shake up! 
We got such a 
lively jar; 
I 
tell you how things got all mixed up 
In a 
one horse bob- tail car. 
We turned the corner rather quick, 
Which threw me on my head ; 
I 
trod on Melinda's bunion foot, 
Her face got fiery red. 
My nose shed tears of a 
cardinal hue, 
I 
saw a 
great big star ; 
Melinda cussed, you bet she did, 
At the one horse bob- tail car. 
Oh, what a 
shake up, etc. 
We quickly turned another curve, 
Which jerked us all in a 
heap, 
I 
tripped and fell in an old maid's lap, 
She F 
creamed and made a 
leap. 
In a 
fat man's stomach Melincla's bead 
'Went plump, which made him spar ; 
She spit on his vest and dropped her teeth, 
In the one horse bob-tail car. 
Oh, what a 
shake up, etc.

COMEDY MIXTURES. 
An entirely new style of act performed only by the Autocrats of 
Ethiopian Comedy and great English Swell Burlesques. 
Written by JAMES NILES. 
I 
KNOW a 
little maiden, ever light and free, 
Her beauty's bright and pearly as a 
shell ; 
In confidence I'll tell you she said she loved but me. 
She lives among the flowers in the dell. 
We often sit together beneath the leafy vine, 
And to each other we confess our love ; 
I 
am so elated to think that she is mine, 
She seems to me an angel from above. 
CHORUS. 
" 
Walking in the starlight," " where flowers blush and 
bloom," 
With the " Lily of the Valley " by my side. 
" 
Dancing in the Moonlight" " Down where the Pansies 
grow," 
" 
Rowing on the Lake" at eventide. 
(
Dance.) 
I'll sing of a 
daisy, I 
know he's not lazy, 
A " Lord Byron" collar he wears with great ease, 
His cuffs are the latest make, his blue necktie he'll never 
shake, 
When'he meets the boys, he's sure to quake 
And shudder with fear. 
CHORUS. 
Dancing, prancing so light and airy, 
Skipping about, he's just like a 
fairy ; 
Eats only cake, and says he won't marry— 
Charley's a 
jovial young man. 
(
Dialogue. 
COMEDY MIXTURES.—Concluded. 
While walking down the street one day, 
I 
met the girl I 
love 
She wore a 
pair of over-ails, 
On her head a 
boxing glove ; 
Was cross-eyed and left-banded too, 
But of that I 
need not speak; 
She had false teeth, her nose was red, 
And plumpers in her -cheek. 
CHORUS. 
But now she's gone away, 
And her no more I'll see, 
She's driving on the Erie Canal, 
She thinks it is the sea; 
If ever she comes back, 
I'll get her a 
job on the track, 
Shovelling sand and carrying rails, 
From here to Kala,mazac. (
Dance.) 
Whenever I 
go out to walk, 
With her along the street, 
she's sure to cause me terrible pain 
By tramping on my feet. 
The shoes she wears 
They are so large, they'd really make you smile. 
They were made out-doors in the summer time, 
And took up half a 
mile. 
But now she's gone away, etc. 
(Dance and Exit.) 
OH, 
IT'S NO USE. 
Original, by Goss and Fox. 
OH, it's no use, oh, it's no use, for they can never beat 
our time, 
We're too soon to let the white folks get ahead. 
Oh, it's no use, it's no use, for we are coons from Caro-
line, 
And we're bound to shout and holler till we're dead. 
We are two stylish nigs from Carolina, 
Now what's the use of trying to outshine us ? 
Oh, it's no use, oh, it's no use, for we are coons from 
Carolina, 
And we're boundsto shout and holler till we're dead. 
Oh, it's no use, it's no use, so throw your hands above 
your head, 
Put your toe and heel down hard upon the floor; 
Oh, it's no trie, oh, it's no use, we kill the white folks 
almost dead, 
And there aint no use of shouting any more. 
We are two stylish nigs from Carolina, 
Now, what's the use of trying to outshine us ? 
Oh, it's no use, oh, it's no use, for we are coons from Car-
olina, 
And we're bound to shout and holler till we're dead. 
LOVE 
Composed by HARRY BENNETT, and sang with success by BILDT 
CARTER. 
Oh, love is such a 
very funny thing, 
Anil iCcatches the young and the old, 
It's just like a 
plate of boarding house hash, 
And many a 
man it has sold! 
It makes you feel like a 
fresh water eel, 
And causes your head to swell; 
You lose your mind, for love is blind, 
And it empties your pocket book as well. 
CHORUS. 
Boys keep away from the gals, I 
say, 
Give them lots of room, 
Or you'll find when you're wed, 
They will bang you till you're dead 
With bald headed end of a 
broom. 
When a 
man is gone on a 
pretty little gal, 
lie talks just as gentle as a 
dove; 
He spends all his money, and calls her his honey, 
For to show her he is solid on his love. 
When his money is gone and his clothes in hock, 
He finds the old saying it is true, 
That a 
mole on the arm is worth two on the leg, 
But what is he going for to do. 
Boys keep away, etc, 
When married folks have lots of cash, 
Their love is firm and strong, 
But when they have to feed on hash, 
Their love don't last so long. 
With a 
wife and seventeen half starved kids, 
I 
tell you it's no fun, 
When your butcher comes around to collect his bill, 
With a 
dog and a 
double barrel gun. 
Boys keep away, ete, 
Young fellows just take my advice, 
Don't be in a 
hurry for to wed, 
You think you're in clover till the honey-moon's over, 
And then you'll think you're dead. 
With a 
cross eyed baby on each knee, 
And a 
wife with a 
plaster on her nose, 
You'll find true love don't rim so very smooth, 
When you have to wear your second hand cloth^s. 
Boys keep away, etc. 
When the rent is high, and the kids all cry 
Because there's no grub to thaw, 
You'll holler for your son 
To load up your gun, 
While you vaccinate mother-in•law.

He had a

Ah! well!

Free to starve. Dere was

WHAT COULD YOU WISH FOR MORE ? 
As sung by NED BARRY. 
IT 
IS 
a 
doleful story I'm going for to tell, 
About a 
fair young damsel who lived in Clerkenwell, 
Her parents were not honest or particularly poor, 
They got their Tommy on the cross, 
And what could you wish for more ? 
CHORE'S. 
Then what could you wish for more, my boys I 
What could you wish for more ? 
Oh, now a 
story I 
will tell of a 
damsel and swell, 
And what could you wish for more ? 
This damsel's name was Mary Ann, though most folks 
called her Poll, 
In face and form she was as fair as any ragshop doll ; 
Her lovers could be counted at twenty to a 
score, 
But in love she fell with a 
gay young swell, 
And what could you wish for more ? 
Then what could you wish, etc. 
In course of time they married, from then no joy they 
know, 
He whacked her with a 
poker and he whacked her with a 
shoe, 
Each day they fought till one was stretched all senseless 
on the floor, 
They found their pokers just the weight, and what could 
they wish for more ? 
Then what could you wish, etc. 
Each day they raved and yelled and screamed, 
Till both became quite hoarse, 
And then they went before the judge and asked for a 
di. 
vorce, 
His honor said such cases he had often heard before. 
So he parted this fond loving pair, 
And what could they wish for more ? 
Then what could you wish, etc. 
The swell resolved on suicide, but hadn't got the pluck, 
He tried to walk into the river, but in the mud he stuck ; 
Then Polly went and fished him out, 
And dragged him to the shore, 
And they both lived happy after that, 
And what could they wish for more ? 
Then what could you wish, etc. 
'TISN'T MINE. 
PARODY ON BABY MINE. 
Written by JAMES NILES. 
Sung with great success by NILES and 
EviNs. 
THERE'S a 
gold watch in the window, 
'Tisn't mine, ' tisn't mine ; 
But I 
think 
have to take it, 
It keeps time, it keeps time; 
Though if I 
should be caught, 
All my trouble will go for naught, 
To the Island I'll be brought 
Right on time, for the watch not mine, 
And on mush and milk I'll dine 
Six months at a 
time. 
T 
here's a 
horse and cutter in the street, 
'Tisn't mine, ' tisn't mine, 
But I 
am going to take it ; 
For a 
pleagant time, pleasant time ; 
And if I 
don't come back, 
They can look for me with a 
hack. 
When I 
am caught they'll break my back. 
What a 
pleasant time, pleasant time, 
So I 
think I'll change my mind, 
And ride behind (
the owner).

And cut the pigeon wing.

SALLY, BLESS MY SOUL! 
Made popular by our Song and Dance Artists, Messrs. W AYNE and 
LOVELY. 
I SHOULD like to know the reason why 
As I 
go down the street, 
There is a 
twinkle in the eye 
Of every girl I 
meet. 
I 
ask'd my cousin Sally once, 
Why it was she smiled so sweet ? 
She says I 
am a 
perfect dunce— 
They're laughing at your feet 
CHORUS . 
I 
blushed and bowed my head with grief, 
My anguish to control; 
And said, when I 
could catch my breath, 
Oh, Sally, bless my soul ! 
Of all the talent I 
possess, 
Those feet they are my pride; 
They are good size, and cost me less 
To walk with than to ride ; 
They always take me out of town 
As fast as I 
can go ! 
And Sally fills me with alarm, 
By talking to me so. 
47 
I 
blushed, etc. 
Now I've resolved to search this town, 
Some smaller shoes to try ; 
That will not draw the glances down 
Of every passer-by. 
I'll get a 
smaller pair, I 
vow, 
And dress up in the style ; 
And when I 
meet my love, I'll bow 
And raise my Harvard tile! 
She blushed, etc.

Where the shamrock grows, 
It was there you stole my heart, dear Barney, 
Just twenty years ago. 
Is that so ? 
It is so. 
Oh, yes, it is so. 
Is that so ? 
It is so. 
Oh, yes, it is so. 
So now we're going to leave you, 
We bid you all farewell,

And when he gets elected

Original Irish Song, written by TERRY FERGUSON. 
I 
SUPPOSE you've all heard of Mary Ann, 
Who has the great edication ; 
Wen, I'm her father, Dinnis, 
And of that there's no dictation. 
I 
brought her up; ' twas at a 
great expense 
Of a 
hundred thousand dollars, 
And now she has a 
piano, 
And forty thousand scollars ; 
And the way she plays 'twould break your heart I'm 
sure. 
(
Break.) 
Her style and grace is something to adore ; (
Break.) 
But I'll love and cherish her through life, 
As long as she can earn a 
dollar : 
At the piano she'll set all day, 
And this is what she'll holler ? 
CHORUS. 
. 
She's a 
darling, she's a 
daisy, 
She's a 
dumplin', she's a 
lamb; 
You should see her play on the piano, 
Such an edication has my Mary Ann. (
Repeat.) 
There's a 
spalpeen 1;3, the name of Billie Malone, 
'Who comes to court my daughter, 
When there all alone, at Dudley's Grove 
It's most to death he'll talk her ; 
He tells her that his mother is a 
king, 
And with all such talk he will stuff her ; 
But if I 
lay my hands on him, 
I'll paralyze that young duffer, 
For away they galavant, and they say tra-la-lo, 
(Break.) 
Skip the gutter, Charley, for you are very fleet. 
(Break.) 
But I'll love and cherish her through life, 
As long as she can earn a 
dollar; 
At the piano she'll set all day, 
And this is what she'll holler : 
She's a 
darling, etc. 
"Nancy Lee." 
Or all the wives as e'er you know, 
Yeo ho! lads, ho !

There's none like Nancy Lee, I 
trow, 
Yeo ho ! lads, ho, yeo ho! 
See, there she stands an' waves her hands, upon the 
quay, 
Au' every day when I'm away she'll watch for me, 
An' whisper low, when tempests blow

Johnny Morgan plays the organ,

Up in a

All among the little stars a- sailing 'round the moon ; 
Up in a

It's something awful jolly to be  
"Courting in the Rain." 
Courting in the rain, courting in the rain, 
I 
ne'er regret the day I 
met my charmer in the lane 
Courting in the rain, courting in the rain 
'Twits sweeter far 
Than moon or star,

" 
Will You ever Shoot that Hat ?" 
It's down Broadway I 
take my way 
With Cornelius, Barney and Pat, 
And the boys all shout when I 
turn out,— 
" 
Sweet Genevieve." 
Oh, Genevieve, I'd give the world 
To live again the lovely past! 
The rose of youth was dew-impearled, 
But now it withers in the blast. 
I 
see thy form in every dream, 
My waking thoughts are full of thee, 
Thy glance is in the starry beam 
That falls along the summer sea 1 
Oh, Genevieve  
" 
Where was Moses ?" 
Where was Moses when the light went out ? 
Where was Moses when the light went out ? 
Now, my little man, tell me if you can, 
Where was Moses when  
" 
Whoa, Emma." 
I 
took my girl one day, 
A-sailing down the bay, 
And Emma was the darling creature's name. 
While standing on the pier, 
Some chaps at her did stare, 
And one and all around her did exclaim—

The old man's drunk again, 
He's lying in the lane,

For they all do it, they all do it, 
Tho' sometimes they rue it, they all do it I 
They all do .it, they all do it, 
And so it will continue till

I've a

Baby mine, baby mine!

He is coming back to me, 
He is sailing o'er the sea, 
I'm as happy as can be

Sunday nights, boys, sure I

ON 
a 
beautiful summer evening, 
When the roses were in bloom, 
While strolling in a 
garden, 
Among the flowers' sweet perfume, 
I 
beheld a 
lovely maiden, 
With a 
face so bright and fair, 
And in her hand she held a 
bunch 
Of flowers rich and rare. 
CHORUS.

my, how my heart did beat,

When I 
beheld that face so sweet, (Break) 
She was as pretty as a 
picture, 
And handled with such care, 
That sweet collection which she had, 
Of flowers rich and rare. 
How anxiously I 
watched her, 
As among the plants she'd glide, 
Till overcome by Cupid's daft, 
I 
hastened to her side. 
Six months of bliss have since gone by, 
My fortune soon she'll share, 
Anti our home will decorated be, 
With flowers rich and rare. 
Oh ! my, etc. 
JOHNNY NEW. 
Written by JAMES NILES. 
Sung with great success by NILES and 
EVA-NS. 
I 
AM going to tell you of a 
nice young man, 
His name was Johnny New, 
He carried water for saloons, and cleaned out spittoons. 
And for you anything he would do ; 
Every clay about nine he would call for wine, 
But the seltzer he would get instead ; 
rhey would squirt in his face with terrific pace, 
Until he was nearly dead. 
CHORUS. 
For he was a 
lusher you see, 
With money he had no use; 
On errands he would run, oh he was a 
burn, 
But now he has gone to the deuce. 
On the sidewalk he would stand with a 
but in his hand, 
And horses to him they would tie, 
He would kick like a 
steer when they would offer him 
beer, 
And he would sigh for the good old rye; 
His feet wasn't mates, they looked like skates ; 
His dark flowing locks were gray. 
His pants and his vest were made out West 
And in his hair was a 
load of hay. 
For he was a 
lusher, etc.

Old Rags and Bottles. 
Words and Music by JOHN T. 
KELLY. 
Prig with immense success by the great " Bards or Tara," KELLY & 
RY.kN. 
We're a 
pair of ould Irish junkmen, 
We buy up what e'er we can rind, 
We work hard at our occupation, 
ln picking up junk of all kind. 
From the dear ould land of the shamrock 
A few years ago we came out, 
As partners we started this business, 
And from morning until night we do shout— 
Cnonus. 
Any ou'd rags, 
(
synz.) 
Any ould bottles, 
(
sym.) 
Any ould rags to put in our bags, 
Have ye any ould rags or bottles to day? 
When we landed with only two shillings, 
We was told by a 
loafer named Burke, 
To go to a 
bladder refinery, 
And the boss would put us to work. 
Faith, we seon found out all their queer tricks, 
Their jokes, their stalls, and their gags, 
So we put the two shillings together, 
And started at bottles and rags. 
Any old rags, etc. 
sow, before we leave we must tell you 
That we love to deal honestly, 
So, if ye have mild rags or bottles, 
We'll come buy them all, do you see ; 
For all kinds of raffs w 
halsoever. 
We'll pay the best price that is out. 
We'll come with our cow bells a- ringing. 
And at the top of our voice we will shout— 
Any old rags, etc.
