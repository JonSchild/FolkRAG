"When once we reach the shore, brave boys,We'll shout and sing for joy:We'll hiss and stone
those horse police,And sing Bold Johnny Troy."They chanced to meet an old man,All on the kings
highway,And Troy rode up to him,While these words he did say,"Your gold watch and your moneyI
quickly do demand,Or I'll blow out your brains instantly[,?]If you refuse to stand.""It's [neither?]
watch or clock I ever had,"The old man then replied[;?]"But for a wife and familyI daily do provide."-

gallant Johnny Troy.Troy then mounted on his steed,And before he rode away,He said, "Here's fifty
pounds, old man;'Twill help you on your way."The poor I'll serve both night and day,The rich I will
annoy[;?]The people round know me right well;They call me "Johnny Troy"["?].

The Lousy MinerAir [md] Dark-eyed SailorIt's four long years since I reached this land,In search of
gold among the rocks and sand;And yet I'm poor when the truth is told,I'm a lousy miner,I'm a lousy
miner in search of shining gold.I've lived on swine 'till I grunt and squeal,No one can tell how my
bowels feel,With slapjacks swimming round in bacon greaseI'm a lousy miner,I'm a lousy miner;
when will my troubles cease?I was covered with lice coming on the boat,I threw away my fancy
swallow-tailed coat,And now they crawl up and down my back;I'm a lousy miner,I'm a lousy miner, a
pile is all I lack.My sweetheart vowed she'd wait for me'Till I return: but don't you seeShe's married
now, sure, so I am told,Left her lousy miner,Left her lousy miner, in search of shining gold.Oh, land of
gold, you did me deceive,And I intend in thee my bones to leave;So farewell, home, now my friends
grow-cold,I'm a lousy miner,I'm a lousy miner in search of shining gold.
