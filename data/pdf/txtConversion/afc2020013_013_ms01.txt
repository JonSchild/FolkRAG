Expanding on the phrase of ‘getting the lapcars down’, and creating room for 
leaders to battle for position 
Role of a starter in communicating directly to drivers 
Avoiding communicating on the one way radio to drivers if possible/unless 
necessary, because it can be distracting 
 
[14:33]  
((SD Card Corruption / Cut Out Audio while Recording. Twelve Seconds Didn’t copy 
over. File is listed as 55:25 in length on playback, but recorded 55:37. 12 seconds of 
Dakota’s response at this point was lost “from talking about why not communicating 
using the one-way radio” to going into some of the different messages that communicates 
to the cars (starting with the caution)))  
 
[15:15]   
Workflow of Making a Call & a Quick Caution 
Description of how a call is made during a race 
Impact and influence of dirt racing in making a call

final say on calls  
Two different radios, track radios for officials, and the one-way radios for 
communicating to drivers  
Can talk about call on the track radio 
Description of a quick caution

Description of Flagstand 
Based on the flagstand, and being on a new flagstand built by Jipper (Jipp Ortiz), 
a longtime starter 
Description of the new flagstand and difference with the old flagstand, including 
the number of holders for the flag, and the light switches for the green, yellow, 
and red 
Story of John Nelson, who was a starter at Holland Speedway then, having the 
flagstand get wiped out by two modifieds in 2013, and being saved by the 
assistant starter 
Flagstand hanging slightly over the track, but is in front of the catch fence 
No personal stressful experiences so far up in the flagstand, but did have 
someone run over his foot when he filled in at the Little R (go kart night), as 
starter is down on the field then 
Revisiting difference between number of holders in old flagstand and new one 
Speed at which calls are make and importance of having flags near you 
Role of light switches in accompanying the flags, and coordinating to color (e.g. 
yellow flag and yellow light) 
 
[23:30]   
Walkthrough of Each Flag Color and Meaning 
Description of the different meanings behind each of the 7 flags used in a race: 
green (go), yellow (caution), red (stop, usually if bad wreck), black (disqualified), 
white (one to go), blue with yellow stripe (leaders are coming/stay in lane) 
Combining flags and hand gestures, like a yellow and a downward push for 
slowing down 
Hoping not to ever use red flag as it means something serious (i.e. like someone 
flipped) happened 
Description of a recent use of the red flag, with a novice sportsman flipping 
Waving the flags in a way drivers can see it more and also depending how 
serious message needs to get across 
Where flags are kept in their holders, most used up front, red always in same

Early Memories of and being an Assistant Starter at Ransomville Speedway 
First memory of being assistant starter at Ransomville with Larry Woodruff 
Joking that first week didn’t have safety goggles – second week, had safety 
goggles 
Adjusting from being a starter for asphalt to dirt 
James Mitchell as assistant starter now, while he is head starter (James is head 
starter for karts) 
Description of how assistant starter and starter work together 
Importance of having another pair of eyes in the flagstand 
Where starters try to keep an eye on everyone, but especially if there is a pack as 
that is where cautions often need to happen 
Excitement of first day as head starter (and not just assistant starter) at 
Ransomville 
Opening day getting rained out after being excited and pumped all day 
Following week having first official day as head starter, and it ‘being what he 
wanted and anticipated it would be like’ 
Moving from the assistant starter role to the head starter role 
 
[31:45]   
Technology and the Starter Position 
No major technology changes recently, as one-way radios have been around for a 
while to communicate to drivers if emergency 
Use of one-way radio on top of the flags, flag still being primary 
Lights and how they factor into flags and radio workflow 
 
[32:45]   
Non-verbal Gestures and Communication as a Starter 
Revisiting and describing the different gestures used as a starter, for 
communicating messages to drivers 
Lack of mirrors in cars making for better racing 
Communicating to drivers in lead distance to next car (behind) 
Practice done by starters now across different speedways, like with Johnny 
Veach at Genesee Speedway 
Gesture for slowing down 
Wearing neon gloves so drivers can see hand gestures better 
Shaking a finger or pointing if someone did something bad or rough riding 
someone, as kind of a warning that they’re watching/driver isn’t racing properly 
for the track 
 
[36:15]   
Walkthrough of Week and Race Day 
No major preparation in the days before, just makes sure everything is charged 
and in the car 
Making sure everything works in the flagstand when get to the track, then walk 
the pits, get the wristbands, and walk the tracks 
Sometimes they will have drivers’ meeting before where tell drivers that 
something happened previous week or this or that, or some new update, like the 
4 cylinders now being brought into the wider dirt rules and stuff for points 
(which is big) 
After drivers’ meeting walks over with assistant starter and get ready to start 
After the race, wrapping everything up and heading over to the pits with the 
race director and to pit steward, to see if any calls need explaining, or to follow 
up on concerns or anything that happened during the race  
 
 
[40:40]   
Flags 
Flags he uses are own flags that he brings back and forth 
Bought a pair this year but before used Doug Kearns hand-me-down flags  
Why Doug’s hand-me-down flags were good in being thicker woven 
Polyester flags versus thicker woven flags 
 
[41:45]   
Starter Differences between Asphalt and Dirt

don’t do regular weekly races 
Starting as head starter for Lancaster Speedway in 2021 
Discussion of any differences between starters on asphalt and dirt, including 
track conditions impact  
Larger difference is lights, especially for Friday night races, and difference 
between compact fluorescent lights and LEDs (LEDs being preferable now) 
 
[44:45]   
Challenges as a Starter 
Discussion of the challenging parts of being a starter, primarily being making 
sure that message gets across through flags or some other way 
Responding to situations right as they happen, as a lot can happen during a race 
Awareness of entire track at the same time, and keeping things in corner of eye 
Anecdote of waiting for two ‘blips’ to go by in corner of eye but only saw one, 
and turned out someone jumped a jersey barrier behind turn one 
Split second decisions, but sometimes now being able to watch and consult 
replay system too so calls can be more accurate (caution is up while reviewing 
the video or making calls) 
 
[48:00]   
Gestures (continued)  
Discussion of communicating with tower during yellow, and line-up after a 
caution before getting clear to race 
Gesture of turning the knob and on the one-way for getting people back re-lined 
up in same positions from before the caution 
 
[49:00]   
Enjoyment in Being a Starter 
Discussion of what he enjoys about working at Ransomville, and being a young 
starter 
Pursuing and wanting to have a long starter career like starters who have been 
doing it for decades like Larry Woodruff and Jipp Ortiz, and looking up to being 
able to be one of those starters who has been around for ages 
Enjoys the adrenaline rush of being a starter, you’re the closest one to the cars  
 
 
 
 
[51:10]   
Advice for Future Starters 
Discussion of advice he’d give someone interested in becoming a starter, 
especially for junior starters, to just copy exactly what the starter is doing or 
saying, and when they do 
Copying as best way to get a feel for split second decisions but not going too 
early, and making calls in your head 
Memory of Wyoming County International Speedway from years ago, when as a 
junior starter he was brought up to the flagstand to wave the green flag, and at 
the time that starter was actually James Mitchell (the assistant starter at 
Ransomville) 
Watching other starters and learning from the older generation of starters as 
much as you can when you can 
Example of Jipp filling in last week, and getting pointers and recommendation 
and experience from Jipp 
 
[53:32]   
Proud Moments and Closing Thoughts 
Proudest moment for him as starter was being the starter for the George Decker 
Memorial race; didn’t know George as he passed away before was born, but 
family was friends with the family  
Was first 100 lap race he was a starter for too, which was some different 
challenges 
Made him more excited for the race and keep the show as good a run as possible 
Reflection on closing thoughts on being a starter, importance of keeping show 
going as best as possible and the split second decisions that are made during a 
race
