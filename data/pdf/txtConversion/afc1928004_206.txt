On ! I 
wander 'mid the roses in the golden summer time, - 
And listen to the streamlet while it rings a 
merry chime ; 
But far sweeter than the roses and the streamlet unto me, 
is the sunlit face of Bessie, darling Bessie of the lea. 
cttORUS. 
She is the fairest flower ever sent to comfort me, 
Pure and gentle as an angel, darling Bessie of the lea, 
Yes, she is the fairest flower ever sent to comfort me, 
She is my star and treasure, darling Bessie of the lea. 
Not a 
bird in the wild wood but will answer to her call, 
Oh ! most I 
love the twilight when the pearly dew- drops fall, 
Then she meets me in the valley and she kindly welcomes me, 
My bonnie star of evening, darling Bessie of the lea. 
She is, etc. 
Oh ! the honey bee may linger where the buds and blossoms 
grow, 
The gentle breeze of summer in its fragrance come and go, 
But they 
l 
will pass unheeded, for wherever she may be, 
My heart is full of Bessie, darling Bessie of the lea. 
She is, etc. 
N Y HEART WITH JOY IS DANCING. 
Oh. have you never met with pretty Jessie? 
She's the sweetest girl in town ; 
The summer of h:r smile would set you crazy, 
With eyes and hair so brown. 
If you should smile upon her, 
She'll tremble with delight ; 
And deem it snail honor, 
Her sweet face flushing bright. 
Oh, did you never meet with pretty Jessie 
Her beauty shames the rose, 
She's fairer than than the lily, 
The sweetest flower that grows. 
CHOICES. 
My heart with joy is dancing, 
With happiness I'm prancing, 
Oh may the joy of life forever bless thee 
Lovely queen of every rose. 
Surpassing is my Jessie, 
The sweetest rose that grows. 
Now is it any wonder I'm so happy, 
As the angels from above ? 
Oh, since the day I 
met with pretty Jessie 
1 
fly on wings of love; 
The little whitecap daisy, 
And every flower that grows, 
All lend their love to Jessie, 
And Jessie soothes their woes. 
Oh, as I 
was walking in the garden, 
In extreme happiness; 
And when I 
popped the question, 
She sweetly answered yes. 
My heart with, &e. 
When sleeping I 
ani dreaming of my Jessie, 
With heart flowing o'er with joy; 
When with her I 
am really over happy, 
When away, I 
heave a 
sigh. 
A month from now we'll marry, 
She wears the wedding ring; 
Now I'm going to see her, 
And say, sweet birdie, sing; 
Tell me that you love me, Jessie darling, 
With a 
flow ofjoy I 
dance; 
There never was one merrier, 
in love's blissful trance.

sung by ANNIE ADAMS. 
There is no mistake about it, boys, 
I 
have a 
handsome beau. 
Just the kind of sort of chap 
I 
like to love, you know. 
And Donald Canning is his name, 
A Scoteliman he's by birth. 
Perhaps the nicest sort of chap 
That ever dwelt on earth. 
I 
fancy I'm hearing him 110W, 
With his row de dow dow dow. 
My Donald is coming, and keeps up a 
drumming 
Row de dow dow de dow. 
He looks delightful, that he does; 
So handsome, and not rough; 
Just like the figures in the shops 
That sell segars and snuff. 
And when I 
see those figures 
I 
oft wish the time had come 
That I 
could claim my Donald, 
His money and his drum. 
I 
fancy I'm hearing him now, 
With his row de (low dow dow. 
My Donald is coming, and keeps up a

Row de dow dow de dow. 
311IIIRLAND WILLIE. 
Hearken an' I

Young Muirland Willie cam' to woo 
Tho' he could neither say nor do,

But aye he cries—Whate'er betide, 
Maggie l'se hae to be my bride. 
With a 
fal lal, &c. 
On his gray yaud as he did ride, 
Wi' dirk and pistol by his side; 
He pricked her on wi' meilc'e pride, 
Wi' meikle mirth and glee, 
Out o'er yon moss, out o'er yon muir, 
Till lie cam' to her daddie's door. 
With a

With a

Now wooer, sin ye are lichlit down, 
Whare do ye won, or in what town, 
I 
think my dochter winna gloom, 
On sic a

The wooer he steppit up the house, 
An' wow I 
but he was wondrous crouse. 
With a

I

Twa guid gann yauds au' gear aneugh,

She was the brawest in a' the town, 
I

But b

The wooer he stendit up in haste, 
An' grippit her hard about the waist. 
With a

To win yeur love, maid, I'm come here, 
I'm young, an' hae aneugh o' gear; 
An' for mysel' you need na' fear, 
Troth, try me whan ye like; 
He took aff his bannet, and spat oot his chew, 
Ile dig-hted his gad, an' he pried her mou. 
With a 
fal lal, 
The maiden mushed, and being'd fu' In' 
She hadna will to say him na; 
But to her daddie she left it a', 
As they twa could agree. 
The lover, he gae her the tither kiss, 
Syne ran to her daddie an' tell'd him this.

The bridal day it came to pass, 
Wi' many a 
blythsome lad and lass; 
But siccan a

Sic mirth was never seen; 
This winsome couple straiked han's, 
Mess John tied up the marriage banns. 
With a

An' our bride's maidens were Da few, 
WI' tapknots, lug knots, a' in blue, 
Frae tfip to tae, they W. ere bran-new,

And aye they bobbit, ank aye they beek't, 
And aye they reel'd and aye ',hey set. 
With a

SONG AND DANCE. 
On, I'm very fond of roving 
When the stars are in the sky, 
And a 
heart so true and loving 
Often meets me on the sly. 
The sweetest words she whispers, 
And her eyes are sparkling blue ; 
But what she says you may be sure 
I'll never tell to you. 
Oh, we wander while the shadows fall, 
But a 
pair of eyes they are my light; 
Of all the joys, it, beats them all, 
This flirting in the twilight. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my heart kept going pit-a-pat, (
Break.) 
I 
scarce could tell what I 
was at; (
Break.) 
We wandered in the shadows, 
But her beaming eyes they are my light; 
Of joys we meet, there's none so sweet 
As flirting in the twilight. 
Now I 
called her pet and dearest, 
And I 
could not tell you half, 
And said she was the nearest, 
Then she laughed a 
little laugh. 
My arm I 
kindly offered, 
Then I 
offered her my hand, 
And said she'd make her darling one 
The happiest in the land. 
There was a 
darkness in the pleasant air, 
But her beaming eyes they are my light; 
I 
kissed her ere she was aware, 
While flirting in the twilight. 
Oh, my heart, etc. 
Now I 
never can forget her, 
Nor her dear ew;cing way, 
Near the place where I 
have met her 
I 
wander every day. 
My heart is in her keeping, 
She has stolen that, I 
know ; 
But she really makes a 
very sweet 
And fascinating beau 
So we wander in the darkness yet, 
But her charming eyes they are my light ; 
My heart was caught in Cupid's net, 
While flirting in the twilight. 
Oh, my heart, etc, 
The bride she cam' out o' the byre. 
An' 0 
as she dighted her cheeks ! 
Sirs, I'm to be married the night, 
An' I 
have neither blankets nor sheets; 
Have neither blankets nor sheets, 
Nor barely a 
coverlet too; 
The bride that has a' thing to borrow 
Has e'en rig t muckle ado. 
CHORM—Woo 'd and marri d 
and a', 
Woo'd and married and a', 
And is she nae very well off 
That is woo'd and married and a'. 
Out spake the auld v.,nidman, 
As he cam' in frae the pleugh ; 
0, dochter baud your tongue, 
And ye's get gear enough ; 
The s' irk that stands in the byre, 
And our braw cowte forbye, 
Keep up your heart, my lass, 
Ye,'se hae baith horse and kye." [ Woo'd. & c. 
The mither she spake neist, 
" 
What needs sae meikle pride ? 
I 
hadna a 
plack in my pooch 
That night I 
was a 
bride ; 
My gown was linsey-woolsey, 
And petticoats only twa; 
An ye hae ribbons an' buskins, 
What wad ye be at ava ?'' [ Woo'd, ctrc. 
Out spake the bride's brither, 
As he cam' in wi' the kye; 
" 
Poor Willie wad ne'er hae ta'en ye, 
Bad he kent ye as well as 1 ; 
For ye're proud and saucy, 
And no for a 
poor man's wife; 
Gin I 
canna get a 
better, 
Pse ne'er take atm 
my life 
The bridegroom he spake neist, 
And he spake up wi' pride; 
"'Twas no for gowd or gear, 
I 
sought you for my bride; 
I'll be prouder o' you at Inute, 
Altho' our haddin' be sma'.

ERASTUS HUNKY DORY. 
SONG AND DAME. 
Orr, my name it is Erastus Hunky Dory, 
I'm a 
pet among the ladies, so they say, 
I'm fond of fun and full of modern glory, 
You can bet I 
am the gayest of the gay. 
Oh, there is one to whom I'm paying my addresses, 
She's sweeter than a 
sweet potato vine, 
She wears such bright and golden curling tresses, 
So I'm longing for the day when she'll be mine. 
CHORUS. 
She's so sweet, (
Break), so neat, (Break) 
She's sweeter than a 
sweet potato vine, 
She wears such bright and golden tresses, 
I'm longing for the day when she'll be mine, 
One evening while with her promenading, 
The twinkling stars had just began to peep, 
The glorious light of day was fa,stly fading, 
All nature calm and hushed as in a 
sleep ; 
She took a 
seat beside a 
bunch of roses, 
I 
placed myself directly at her feet, 
While she admired the violets and posies, 
I 
whispered in her ear that she was sweet. 
She's sweet, etc.

NEVER GO BACK ON THE POOR. 
AIR.—" Don't put your foot on a 
man when he's down." 
IN 
this world of sorrow, of toil and regret, 
There are scenes I 
would gladly pass o'er, 
But stern truth compels that each fact must be told, 
That thro' life we may check them•the more. 
Is it right that a 
man who has well earned his pay 
On the pipes by the sweat of his brow, 
Should wait like a 
beggar content day by day, 
Or else home in hunger to go 3 
CHORUS. 
If a 
man is in trouble, remember this song, 
Go drive the grim wolf from his door, 
Assist him in need, you will seldom be wrong, 
f 
you never go back on the poor. 
From the wild waste of waters a 
death-cry came, 
As dashed on the iron-bound shore, 
A 
noble ship struck in the darkness of night, 
And sank ' mid the tempest's loud roar, 
The captain asleep and the men off their posts, 
With the coal and provisions run short, 
While the doomed ones they hoped for that bright western 
land, 
Which in joyous sweet dreams they had sought. 
CHORUS. 
Can it be such neglect shall by us be forgot 1 
Or that money shall triumph once more? 
A 
good willing hand, a 
stout branch and a 
rope, 
For those who go back on the poor.

NEVER GO BACK ON THE POOR.—Continued. 
'When the divers went down ' neath the wreck to search 
For the victims that lay far below, 
" ' Tis only a 
steerage," was oft the remark, 
As the ghastly form came up to view. 
As if only a 
steerage could shut out a 
soul, 
Because poverty claimed him her own; 
As if dollars and dimes are the standard of worth, 
And the pass to all good that is known. 
CHORUS. 
But the White Star must el-
111113.;e its emblem aloft, 
To blood- red, afloat and ashore, 
Till the steamer Atlantic's forgotten by time, 
With its cargo of unburied poor. 
At the stands on the corner of every street, 
The aged and the blind used to be, 
And work out a 
living to save them from want, 
From the poor-house that they might be free. 
But now, stout Italians, healthy and strong, 
Each old grandmother's driven away ; 
I 
don't think the people will stand the base wrong, 
Of these people who work under pay. 
CHORUS. 
And the newsboy or bootblack that toils morn and night 
To keep hunger and pain from the door 
Have been pushed to the wall by these great organ men, 
Let us never go back on the poor.

GAL THAT I DIET IN THE DOCTOR'S SHOP. 
-Words by GEORGE COOPER. 
In New York City once there stood 
A 
shop well known to fame, 
And pills and squills its owner sold, 
But I 
cannot tell his name. 
Near by that shop there lived a 
maid, 
A lovely flower was she, 
A 
nice young chap did loved that maid, 
And that young chap was me 
Icpoken-I was only a 
clerk for the doctor, 
above pills ! 
I 
stood behind the counter one day and there I 
met my love. 
I 
really assure you 
CHORUS. 
The first time that I 
saw her 
I 
was her adorer, 
And sweeter to me than a 
raspberry drop 
Was the girl that I 
met at the doctor's shop. 
Susan Jane was this maiden's name, 
A lovely " dose" was she 
0! lots of love I 
had for her, 
And she had the same for me. 
I 
asked her if I 
could prescribe 
To cure her beating heart, 
And then she sighed, and then I 
vowed, 
That we shi,uld never part! 
Spoken—How could I 
help it ? 
1 
kissed her once and then I 
repeated the dose, for you see— 
The first time that I 
saw her, &c. 
The next week saw her my good wife, 
And we're happy as can be; 
I 
know no trouble, care, or strife, 
Since she's belonged to me. 
Of course we keep a 
doctor's shop, 
And a 
little doctor too, 
His name is Helmbold and we live 
lip in Fifth Avenue. 
Spoken—Fact' 
You all know how it is! 
As I've told you 
before— 
but I 
had a 
soul 
The first time that I 
saw her, & e.

KING Alt'rHUR. 
When Arthur first in court began 
To year long-hanging sleeves, 
He entertain'd three serving men ; 
And all of them were thieves. 
The first lie was au Irishman, 
The second he was a 
Scot ; 
The third he was a 
Welshman, 
And all were knaves 1

The first he was, &e. 
The Irishman lov'd usquebangh. 
The Scot lov'd ale call'd Blue-cap ; 
The Welshman he lov'd toasted cheese, 
And made his mouth like a 
mouse- trap. 
Usquebaugh burnt the Irishman, 
The Scot was drown'd in ale ; 
The Welshman had like to be chok'd with a 
mouse, 
But he pull'd her out by the tail. 
Usquebaugh burnt, etc.

My father wad hoe me to marry the miller,

But brawly I

That brightens their tancy to ony regard. 
The miller is crooked, the in

He's mild. and he's cauld, and he's hi lit', and he's bald.

And him I

Though father and mil her shonld scold and abuse me,

For his heart is sae NV:11111. and sae stately his form, 
And then, like myseP, he's just merry eighteen. 
IN THE BOWERY. 
TONY PASTOR'S great Sensation Song. 
Ant.— " Piccadilly." 
This song has been called for nightly for months in succession and 
having been sung by Mr PASTOR in his own inimitable style, has been 
received with thunders of applause.) 
Some say that Central Park's the place, 
For fun of every kind ; 
On Broadway and Fifth avenue 
Much pleasure others find. 
But I'm a 
different, sort of chap 
No fun in that I 
see, 
For when I 
want enjoyment 
The Bowery for me. 
Spoken.—Yes, you may talk about your Broadway belles, your 
Fifth avenue swells, your exquisitely- dressed creatures, with 
their lavender kids, and their la-de-da's, now, what do they know 
about enjoyment? 
They are afraid to go in for a 
little fun for 
fear of disarranging their toilets: and then what would Mrs. 
Grundy say ? " Charles Frederick Augustus is getting decidedly 
vulgar; Seraphina Ern elia is positively shocking !" 
But here in 
the Bowery, people enjoy themselves just when they f, ,e1 like it. 
They don't care a 
curse what others may say, for that's the cus-
tom. 
CHORUS. 
In the Bowery, in the Bowery, 
For beautiful girls with bright eyes and dark curls, 
In the Bowery, in the Bowery, 
That's were I 
reside when I'm home. 
No butterflies of fashion there, 
Or idlers may be found, 
But men with open hearts and hands, 
With honest labor browned; 
Men who, to help a 
friend in need, 
Would their last dollar lend, 
Who never live on other folks. 
But earn the cash they spend. 
Spoken.—Yes, there is no place in the Bowery for those well-
dressed corner statues to try to look like millionaire's sons, while 
their mothers are out scrubbing for a 
dollar a 
day to sty port 
them in idleness. 
A fellow has no business on the east aide of 
town unless he wants to work and earn his own living.

There was Washington, he was a 
farmer, and Franklin a 
printer, 
Warren a 
doctor. 
Andy Johnson a 
tailor. 
Abe Lincoln a

splitter, and Grant a 
tanner. 
If you want to see meu who make 
our country great, who add to her weaith, develope her resources, 
maintain her strength and prosperity ; you will always find them— 
In the Bowery, die. 
The other day a 
well- dressed fop, 
While walking through the street, 
Insulted a 
poor working girl 
With whom he chanced to meet 
A young mechanic came along, 
And heard the words he said. 
He soon pitched in to the fop 
And on him put a 
head. 
Spoken.—Yes, he laid the cowardly rascal out. " Now," he 
says, '' git up and git, and if ever I 
catch you insulting a 
female 
again I'll add a 
French roof to that head I've put on you." The 
dandy quietly sneaked away; the young lady turned to her 
preserver, with tears in her eyes, and said; " My dear sir, how 
can I 
ever thank you for the kindness which you have shown me 
in protecting me from the insults of that ruffian. and I 
hope, sir, 
we shall meet again. 
Do you live near here ?" Certainly, young 
lady, Tin always found— 
In the Bowery, dzc. 
When dark rebellion raised its head, 
And war o'erspread he land, 
When rushed unto Columbia's aid 
Each gallant hero band. 
Among the foremost on the field, 
Amid the battle's noise, 
Upholding still out starry flag, 
Was found the Bowery boys. 
Spoken—When the call came for soldiers in the hour of danger, 
the Bowery was the first to send its volunteers, and nobly did 
they do their duty. 
Who does not remember that incident at 
the battle of Anteatam, when the enemy charged in full force, 
one brave regiment bravely stood its ground, under a 
terrifle fire 
and changed the tide of seeming defeat to one of glorious victory. 
This was noticed by General McClellan, who exclaimed ; " What 
regiment is this!' "New York Volunteers r 
was the answer.

Good-evening, kind friends, 'here I 
be, 
I 
thought I'd just drop in to see, 
If there are any here like me, 
Who acts upon the stage. 
The people call me Jack of Hearts, 
Because I 
play auch funny parts, 
I 
laugh and cry, by fits and starts, 
Then fly into a 
rage. 
(Imitations.) 
CHORUS. 
I'm very fanny, some folks say, 
To see me sad, makes you feel gay, 
What I 
call work, you call play, 
Oh ! I 
wish it was salary day. 
The funniest thing I've got to tell, 
Is about a 
girl named Isabel, 
With her over ears in love I 
fell, 
While acting on the stage. 
To-day, she did my heart delight, 
By saying, that on next Sunday night, 
She'd be my wife, all right and tight, 
I 
laughed, you may engage. 
(Business of laughing, 4-c.) 
l'm very funny. 
They say, that true love never runs smooth 
And here's a 
letter which goes to prove 
What a 
fool I 
was to fall in love, 
While acting on the stage. 
To- day she went for water, to the well, 
She leaned too far, and in she fell, 
And down to the bottom went Isabel, 
So now 
leave the stage. 
(Business of crying.) 
I'm very funny, dm. 
There's many songs been sung of late, 
In praise of various wines. 
Whilst some of other liquors state, 
Most suited to the times. 
In one they sing of Burgundy, 
Which some much love to see, 
For Moselle, Cliquot add Champagne, 
But none of them suit me. 
Sherry ! sherry ! sparkling sher: y 
Is the wine to make you merry, 
When you do feel dull or heavy, 
Sherry ! sherry ! sparkling sherry ! 
Is the wine at any time, my boys, for me. 
When out at either rout or ball, 
Or if to sup or dine, 
They never trouble me and ask, 
For they all know my wine. 
The very best is saved for me, 
The sparkling, dry and pure, 
And in the highest circles I'm 
A well-known connoieseur. 
Spoken—Yes, I'm looked upon as a 
Solon, a 
Socrates, a 
per-
fect Solomon in judgement. 
When wines are in question no one 
dare to dispute my word, or— 
Sherry I (Le. 
And just the same if I 
by chance, 
Stroll round unto my club, 
At billiards make a 
stroke or two, 
At whist, p'r'eps, take a

(The bell I 
need not ring) 
With noiseless step and smiling face, 
My lay rite wine they bring.

MARY OF THE WILD MOOR. 
It was on one cold winter's night, 
As the wind blew across the wild moor, 
When Mary came wandering home with her babe, 
Till she came to her OW11 father's door. 
Oh, father, dear father, F 
he cried, 
Come down and open the door, 
Or this child in my arms will perish and die, 
By the wind that blows across the wild moor. 
Oh, why did I 
leave this dear spot, 
Where once I 
was happy and free P 
But now, doomed to roam without friends or home, 
And no one to take pity on me. 
The old man was deaf to her cries; 
Not a 
sound of her voice reached his ear; 
But the watch-dog did howl, and the village bell UN, 
And the wind blew across the wild moor. 
But how must the old man have felt, 
When he came to the door in the morn. 
Poor Mary was dead, but the child was alive, 
Closely pressed in its dead mother's arms. 
Half frantic he tore his gray hair, 
And the tears down his cheeks they did pour, 
Saying, this cold winter's night, she perished and died, 
By the wind, that blew across the wild moor, 
The old man in grief pined away, 
And the child to its mother went soon; 
And no one they say, has lived there to this day, 
And the cottvge to ruin has gone, 
The villagers point out the spot, 
Where the willow droops over the door, 
Saying, there Mary died, once a 
gay village bride, 
By the wind that blows across the wild moor!

THE BUGABOO. 
As Sung by JERRY BMIRINGTON. 
COME all ye tender-hearted boys, wherever you may be, 
And I'll tell you of the dangers upon the dark blue sea, 
Of the dangers and the hardships, my boys, that I went 
throuall,* 
When I 
shipped as cook and steward my boys, on board of the 
Bugaboo. 
*Repeat. 
The day when first I 
joined her she lay in James street canal : 
She was large and stout and beautiful—forget her shape I 
never 
shall : 
The captain wore a 
large straw hat, knee breeches and a 
body 
coat so blue,* 
Arrah, boys, he'd made a 
fine figurehead for to ornament the 
Bugaboo. 
*Repeat. 
We soon weighed anchor and set sail to plough the raging surf, 
We were bound for the bog of Allan to get a 
load of turf. 
We sailed until we passed the back of Richmond barracks so 
true,* 
When the gallant 84th fired a 
royal salute of bricks at the cap-
tain of the Bugaboo. 
*Repeat. 
We sailed three years when a storm arose, and the sea ran 
mountain high, 
The thunder rolled, the lightning flashed and lit the dark blue 
sky, 
So the second mate gave orders to lower the sails and clew,* 
While the captain down below was smoking in his bed—he set 
fire to the Bugaboo. 
*Repeat. 
When the captain found what he had done, he loud for help did 
shout, 
lie called up through the chimney-top for the helmsman to 
come and put it out; 
But the helmsman was fast asleep, and to his post untrue,* 
And the fire burned so hard through the middle of the turf, 
they couldn't save the Bugaboo. 
*Repeat. 
When fifteen thousand miles from land in latitude fifty-four, 
The fire it burned so hard one night, that it couldn't burn any-
more; 
So the captain he gave orders to lower the boats and save the 
crew,* 
While 1,000 rods of turf and 50,000 men were smothered in the 
Bugaboo. 
*Rep/at 
Happy little nigs are we, 
Just as gay as gay can be, 
Always laughing and don't cry, 
Twist our heel and wink our eye. 
CHORUS. 
Watch dis motion, (
Break.)

Dat's de titne we has our fun; 
Always happy, light and free, 
Sorrow never comes to we.

Joy in everything we see; 
Snow or cloudy, wet or dry, 
Always laughing, never sigh.

Some ninety years ago. 
Old England tried to whip us,

And I think she never will forget 
That place called Bunker Hill.

She tried it once again, 
For to whip us Yankee boys 
She came across the main 
She met with Hickory Jackson 
And he gave her Yankee Beans; 
And I. likewise think she wont forget 
A place called New Orleans.

And many once happy firesides

For meny men beneath the sod 
They died defending our starry flag

GLASS PUT IN. 
Sung by BILLY W EST. 
I'll sing you the truth of a 
gallant youth, 
And his name it was Johnny Glass; 
He was a 
Glazier by trade, and the stamps he made, 
As through the back streets he'd pass. 
He commenced in life with his putty and knife 
And a 
box full ot glass to begin ; 
He was as fat as a 
cub, and loud of his grub. 
As he halloed out glass put in. 
Ile would rise like a 
lark, from daylight to dark 
he'd trudge around through the wind and rain; 
By the light of the lamp, he would count out his stamps, 
Next morning he would be off again. 
It was, joy to his soul, a 
pane with a 
hole, 
Or a 
window patched up with tin ; 
He would turn up his eyes, and yelp like a 
putp, 
Do you want any glass put in. 
But a 
sad mishap befell this chap, 
And the fault was not all his own; 
lie was shot Ulm' the heart with a 
sly Cupid's dart, 
By a 
little Dutch gal half grown. 
With her huge left paw, she'd smack him in the jaw, 
When she would ger too full of gin ; 
As he'd roll in the dirt, says she where are you hurt, 
But his answer was glass put in. 
He made her his frau, but I 
can't tell you how 
They passed their honey-moon; 
But the kraut was hot, a 
smoking in the pot, 
Every day as he'd toddle home at noon. 
As years rolled by, four babies would cry, 
Three boys, and a 
girl, what a 
sin ; 
He christened the lass, put in glass, 
And the boys he called glass put in. 
BANJO SOLO. " I WISH I WAS A FISH.' 
Sung by Blur W EST. 
Aikl—" AVM -king Down Broadway." 
I 
wish I 
was a 
fish, 
How happy 1 
would be; 
If I 
could live upon the land, 
As well as in the sea. 
In a 
bird-cage I'd be useful, 
As the preacher in the church; 
For when the b'rds would light on me 
Of course I'd be a 
Perth. 
.1 wish T 
was a 
fish, 
Oh, wouldn't it be sweet; 
Made into a 
bouquet 
And thrown at some ladies' feet. 
And when she'd pick me up, 
If so inch tied she felt; 
And nut me to her little Bose, 
Of course I'd be a 
Smelt. 
I 
wish I 
was a 
fish, 
I'd like to be a 
whale; 
For then I 
would be tm.!ful. 
From my head down to nly 
And it' some honest man, 
Who had to ‘vork and toil; 
Would bore a 
hole right through my back, 
Why there he would Strike On. 
I 
wish I 
was a 
fish, 
I'd like to be a 
shad ; 
Go swimming in the Hudson, 
And uever would feel bad. 
wouldn't mind the steamboats, 
Nor have a 
single care: 
I'd go from here to Albany, 
And wouldn't pay any fate. 
I \visit I 
was a 
fish, 
I'd like to be it trout ; 
Go swimming in the water, 
And poking out my snout. 
And when you'd go a 
fishing, 
You'd all get fit:i of beer; 
I 
wouldn't bite at your old bait, 
But slide off on my ear. 
AIR —" Gens d'Armes Duet." 
Two policemen on the best are we, 
Dressed in nice warm winter clothes, 
And we're strictly temperate, you see, 
You can tell it by our nose. 
We watch little boys upon the street, 
And when they to fight begin, 
We take ' em in, (Repeat twice.) 
For they are not strong, you know, 
We take 'em in, (Repeat twice.) 
But the big rascals we let go. 
Woodhull and Clallin good folks condemn, 
For they've blood upon the brain; 
But, George Francis Train, he comforts them. 
And keeps them on good champagne. 
Now if they get out and come to us, 
And wash them of their sin, 
We'll take em in, ( Repeat twice.) 
And show them something funny; 
We'll take ' em in, (
Repeat twice.) 
And we don't want any blood- money. 
We are much obliged for your applause, 
And we're glad you like our song ; 
But our voices are about used up because 
Our throats are not very strong. 
Some other night when you come this way, 
With your pockets full of tin, 
We'll take you in ; (Repeat Twice.) 
So you should let us off, we think, 
We must away, 
We cannot stay, 
We must obey, 
Our orders say 
That we must go and take a 
drink.

110W TkIAT POOR GAL SUFFERED FOR ME. 
BANJO SOLO. 
Now listen lo me and a 
story I 
will tell 
Of a 
sad calamity; 
It happened to a 
gal, her name was Sal, 
And dearly she loved me; 
She left her home on my account 
To cross the raging sea, 
And it almost bursts my heart in two, 
When I 
think bow she suffered for me. 
I 
took her out one Sunday afternoon, 
Just for to have a 
lark; 
Says she, my love, the ball is up, 
We'll go to the Central Park. 
When we got on the ice she went to strike out, 
But the ice being slippery, 
Her heels flew up, she came down ker slap 
How that gal did suffer for inc. 
For seven long years I 
courted her, 
With all nay might and main, 
And I 
swore that none should separate ma 
From my sweet Mary Jane! 
But it happened one dark and stormy night, 
To an oyster saloon went she, 
Where she choked to death with a 
soft-shell crab, 
Which ended her suffering for me.

THE INCREASE OF THIRST. 
Ant.—" Crime." 
I'vE been drinking of late, I've been drinking— 
And the fact I 
can scarcely deny— 
I've been drinking hot gin and rum-punches, 
But now I'm obliged to go dry! 
Cries the man at the bar: " You're a 
bummer, 
You're something I 
can't understand; 
You've worked like a 
man all the summer, 
And still you've no scrip in your hand. 
It is true you are cheeky and bold, sir, 
All the rum I 
have got you could hold, sir ; 
You could drink a 
whole barrel, I'm told, sir— 
Can you wonder the reason you're dry V' 
It is true what you say, Mr. Landlord, 
I 
ought to have scrip laid away— 
A 
great plenty to go on a 
bust, sir, 
And drink cocktails all night and all day; 
But you are like a 
dog in the manger, 
You might treat me, would you but try, 
But to bummers you act like a 
stranger ; 
Can you wonder the reason I'm dry 1 
For my thirst you don't care a 
thing, sir, 
For the rich man you'll make a 
gin- sling, sir, 
While I 
for my beverage must sing, sir— 
Can you wonder that sometimes I'm dry 1 
'Tis true what you say, Mr Landlord, 
Good liquor is hard to resist; 
Just look at that poor drunken rounder— 
Few drinks, God knows, he has missed; 
Can you wonder at his weak constitution, 
When he drinks every time that he's asked ? 
(1) 
THE INCREASE OF THIRST.—Continued. 
Soon he'll go to that great institution, 
To the State Farm he'll stagger at last. 
There's his poor wife at home, God defend her ! 
With children whose years are quite tender, 
All the bread that they get kind friends send her— 
Can you wonder they're hungry and dry ? 
Can you wonder I'm dry, can you wonder, 
When there's so many like me on the beat, 
So many poor thirsty creatures, 
Who would much rather drink than to eat ? 
There's a 
rounder in the corner sits grinning 
In the broad open light of the night— 
In my pockets I've not got a 
shilling, 
Or we'd both be exceedingly tight; 
Ile smiles with contempt and derision, 
A 
hot whiskey punch meets his vision, 
But the price of good liquor has risen, 
And still we are forced to go dry. 
Just think while you're drinking your wine, sir, 
That I'm not too proud to drink rum; 
While the drinks that you take can't be counted, 
'Tis a 
godsend for me to get one! 
Go visit the places that I 
take in ; 
Such sights you will never behold. 
When a 
man's broke, his friends all forsake him, 
Though his heart may be made of pure gold! 
While one drink would soon break asunder 
The thirst this poor sufferer is under ; 
Hear me plead with a 
voice loud as thunder; 
Oh! why will you let me go dry ?

Oh, love, when you're in love, to presents, to parties and picnics 
you treat her, 
Oh, love, just squeeze her glove, and you feel just as tho' you'd 
like to eat her ; 
But the best of loves must part—then an end comes to yeti:

You press the dear one to your heart and take from her the

You bid her good-bye at the door with another sly kiss and two

Oh love, when you're in love every half hour you'd go to court 
her. 
But oh, love, if she won't love, you talk about drowning yourself 
in cold water; 
If it's all right she'll giggle and say, please ask father if I 
may, 
Then you feel so jolly and gay, and tease her till she names the 
day, 
You'll serenade her when she's abed and her dad drops flower-
pots on your head. 
Oh love, etc. 
Oh love, when you've your love out, all the money you have 
you must ladle, 
Servants, dresses, parties, and balls, perhaps each year a 
cherub 
to lay in the cradle. 
When the honeymoon is past then your eyes are not so blind, 
Your dream was far too good to last and your face glows long 
Your l

beautiful twins. 
Oh love, etc.

MARRY FOR LOVE AND WORK FOR SILLER. 
When I 
and my Jenny thegither were tied, 
We had but sma' share o' the world between us ; 
Yet lo'ed ither wed, and had youth on our side, 
And strength and guid health were abundantly gi'en us. 
I 
warsled and toiled through the fair and the foul, 
And she was right carefte o' what I 
brought till her ; 
For aye we had mind o' the canny auld rule, 
Just " marry for love and work for shier." 
Our bairnts they cam' thick— we were thankfu' for that, 
For the bit and the braille, cam' aye alang- 
them; 
Our pan was exchanged for a 
guid muckle pat, 
And, somehow or ither, we aye had to gi .e 
them. 
Our laddies grew up, and they wrought wi' myser, 
Ilka tine gat as buirdly and stout as a 
miller; 
Our lasses they keepit us trig aye, and hale, 
And now we can count a 
bit trifle o' siller. 
But I 
and my Jenny are baith wearin' down, 
And our lads and our lasses line a' gotten married; 
Vet see, we can rank wi' the best i' the town, 
Though our noddles we never too haughtily earned. 
And, mark me— I've now go a 
braw cockil hal, 
And in our civic building am reckon' ; a 
pillar ; 
Is an that a 
bit honour for ane to get at, 
Wii married for love and wha wrought for siller

SONG AND DANCE. 
two black aristocrats are we, 
And depend upon our style, 
To take us into high society; 
Of course we're thin, but that's no sin, 
As long as we are gay, 
Our parents tell us we were born 
In Southern Africa. 
Oh my brother Ike and I 
are bloods, 
At least the people say, 
And more than that the ladies' pet and joy.; 
They say we're black but what of that, 
Each dog must have his day, 
Like us two black aristocrats 
From Southern Africa.

WHY ARE YOU NITANDERING.—[Commump.] 
" 
Tell me again," the old man said, 
"Why are you loitering here, fair maid i" 
" 
The nightingale's song, so sweet and clear, 
Father," said she, " I 
come to hear." 
"Fie I 
fie h" she heard him cry; 
"Nightingales all, so people say, 
Warble by night, and not by day; 
Warble by night," &c. 
The sage looked grave, the maiden shy, 
When Lubin jumped over the stile hard by; 
The sage looked graver, the maid more glum, 
Lubin he twiddled his finger and thumb; 
"Fie I 
fie ! young maiden, fie 
Poppies like these I 
own are rare, 
And of such nightingales' songs beware; 
Such nightingales' songs," eze. 
MY BARK IS ON THE DREARY SEA. 
Favorite Ballad. 
My bark is on the dreary sea, 
Adieu, to-night we sever; 
Friend of my soul I 
I 
will think on thee, 
I 
will on thee for ever; 
And as my bark goes swiftly o'er 
Yonder moon-lit sea, 
The parting tear I 
will think upon, 
I 
will ever think on thee. 
I 
will ever, (Szc. 
When sailing through life's dreary tide, 
Should I 
forget thee ? never ! 
I'll think of thee while oceans roar, 
I 
will think of thee for ever; 
And as the night wind blows me on 
Yonder moon-lit sea, 
Thy parting tear I 
will think upon, 
I 
will ever think on thee. 
I 
will ever, &e. 
LITTLE WELLY BAY. 
As sung by JAMES MC 
CeLa, the English Comic. 
I 
love a 
little country queen, a 
village beauty rare, 
With rosy cheeks and pearly teeth, and lovely nut-brown 
hair 
her waist it is so slender, and her feet they are so small, 
Of all the girls I 
ever loved my Nelly beats them all. 
CHORUS. 
Nelly Ray, Ne:ly Ray, charming little Nell, 
Nelly Ray, Nelly Ray, pretty little belle ; 
Nelly Ray like birds of May, singing all the day, 
I 
never had a 
sweetheart like my charming Nelly Ray. 
Her father keeps a 
farm house, in a 
village down in Kent, 
And being on my holidays, to spend them there I 
went ; 
And while a 
strolling through the fielth, as on my way I 
roamed, 
It's there I 
met my Nelly, as she drove the cattle home. 
Nelly Ray, tke. 
I 
took my Nelly for a 
walk, among the bright green grass, 
And words of love I 
whispered to this young country lass; 
I 
placed my arms around her waist, as I 
sat by. her side, 
And while we were a 
talking she pledged to be my bride. 
Nelly Ray, 8ze. 
And now we'ved named the happy day, and how happy 
we shall be, 
No thoughts of jealousy shall enter the minds of her or 
me; 
But in our farm-house we'll be happy, night and day, 
And our lives shall pass like sunshine, for I 
have the 
brightest ray. 
Nelly Ray, &e. 
DEM BOYS I 
M E 
inventive genius of Yankee juveniles has brought out a 
new toy. 
It consists of a 
tin box with a 
hole punched in the 
end, through which they draw a 
waxed thread, makinu most un-
earthly noises— some like hens, others like sick cats, and some 
perfe(tly demoniacal in sound. 
The citizens of Brookly, have 
been much annoyed by " leetle boys mit boxes." 
Our foreign 
correspondent from " over the river" sends us the following 
germanesque effusion. 
Der schades uf night vas vallin' down 
Ofer der roofs of Brooklyn town, 
Ten droo der shtreets you hear dear noise 
Of five, six hundred leetle boys 
Mit boxes. 
Dese boxes vot dey shteels, I 
know, 
Dey doesn't buy dem any how; 
Und round der shtreets dey goes in " rings," 
A-bullin' at dem cursed dings,

You bet! 
Yell I 'taint no use dot I

OLD SNOOZER BEN. 
I'VE been walking around this big city, 
I'm so tired I 
scarcely can jog, 
I 
was hoping some friend would take pity, 
And treat me to one glass of grog. 
Whenever I 
go in a 
gin mill, 
They order me out there and then, 
And say that I'm drunk and had my fill, 
And they've nicknamed me Old Snoozer Ben. 
Once I 
was in good circumstances, 
And had hosts of friends among men, 
But I 
lost all by taking the chances; 
And bad luck struck Old Snoozer Ben. 
Pm waiting—I'm waiting, 
I'm looking for some friends to come, 
It's provoking—I'm choking, 
I'm shaking for one glass of rum. 
When I 
was a 
respectable body, 
Then friends would meet me at the door, 
And insist on my having a 
toddy, 
But they never do so any more, 
They helped me to spend all my money, 
As they had many poor fools they meet. 
But now- a- days they all think it funny, 
To help boot me out in the street. 
(1) 
* 
OLD SNOOZER BEN.---Continued. 
But yet it's the way of the times now, 
I've noticed it time and again, 
If a 
man's down and ain't any dimes now, 
lie's as bad off as Old Snoozer Ben. 
CHORUS. 
I'm waiting—Pm waiting, 
In hopes that some old friend I'd meet, 
Only think now— one drink now, 
Can I 
find no friend that will stand treat ? 
I 
feel that I'm.fast growing weaker, 
If only I 
had just a 
drop. 
My poor wife, oh! how can I 
seek her 7 
Oh rum— rum, oh ! why can't I 
stop ? 
What figures are those that are near me, 
It's the forms of my poor wife and chill, 
They are starving at home—oh ! dear me, 
Give me brandy or I 
shall go wild. 
But no, I 
must banish this madness, 
And try to be a 
man among men, 
Our hearts filled with joy and with gladness, 
I 
never will get drunk again. 
CHORUS. 
I 
must bear it—I 
swear it, 
No liquor for me e'er again, 
No shrinking—or drinking, 
So pattern from Old Snoozer Ben.

LITTLE MARY ANN. 
In a 
quiet little village near the banks of a 
stream, 
-Where poets love to wander and sweet music seems to dream, 
'Where the ivy-covered spire points aloft to happier spheres, 
And bids both young and old prepare to meet declining years, 
In a 
green and shady lane, long ere I 
became a 
man, 
whisper'd vows to heaven and my little Mary Ann. 
My little Mar)? Ann, 
Sweet little Mary Ann, 
I 
whisper'd vows to heaven and my little Mary Ann. 
But as years passed slowly on I 
impatiently did wait 
To reach that joyous time which gives to manhood its estate, 
When I 
should plow and mow and gaily sing the jocund song 
Of the husbandman who plods his way so merrily along. 
Then I 
did as duty bade me, and ever sought a 
plan 
To enable me some summer's morn to wed my Mary Ann. 
My little Mary Ann, 4t.c. 
By industry I 
gained a 
little fortune of my own, 
For well I 
knew what I 
would reap, must first be duly sown ; 
I 
bought a 
pretty cottage and a 
garden hi full store, 
Where roses twined with honeysuckle graced the rustic door, 
Now my joy was near complete and to perfect make my plan, 
I 
hastened and I 
married my dear little Mary Ann. 
My little Mary Ann, tte. 
The squire of the village gave the blooming bride away, 
And often have we called on hint to celebrate the day ; 
Upen her brow he placed a 
wreath of flowers choice and rare, 
Full many a 
year that wreath we've kept and o'er them breathed 
a 
prayer. 
Each day our bliss increases since our wedding life began, 
And the village sung from morn to night is little Mary Ann. 
My little Mary Ann, dze.
