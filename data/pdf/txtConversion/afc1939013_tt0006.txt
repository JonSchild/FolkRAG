Birdie, Birdie In the Tree [Textual Transcription]
RECORD 2
A3 “Birdie, birdie, in the Tree” A Conch song sung by Wilbur Roberts, Riviera, Florida,
January 16, 1940. About a small child who tells its mother about some snow birds it sees
on a limb outside the window. The child thinks the birds are real, but they are actually
made of snow and were placed there by the child's father. In the first part of the song the
child is talking to its mother about the birds it sees on the limb, while in the last part the
child is talking to a real bird it sees on the garden walk, and which he thinks is the mother
of the snow birds.
BIRDIE, BIRDIE, IN THE TREE
Birdie, birdie, in the tree, See them, Mama, one, two, three; See they spread their
pretty wings, Oh, what darling, pretty things! Snow white darlings look around, See your
breakfast on the ground?
Mama dear, see how still they keep? Do you think they are asleep? Do they know that it is
day? They would wake and fly away.
Mama on the garden walk, Smile to hear her children talk, Sake the limb, down birdies go,
Papa made them out of snow.
