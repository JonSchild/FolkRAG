we'll start by having each of you introduce yourselves and what you do.

Okay? I started out in cyberspace.  
 
KC  00:22 
Tell me your name first.  
 
TO  00:23 
Toby Gallo, O'Neal.  
 
Helene McCabe  00:26 
Toby Gallo O'Neal, yeah.   
 
TO  00:28 
...and I live in Beaufort, North Carolina and self-employed. I guess, right? And I started back in the 
service station in 1967. I started painting over the lifespan. I ain't have any money, but I met a guy that 
run—owned the station. I said "I have fifty dollars." I said "I haven't got any money but I'll make you 
some. So he left me at the station with an assignment—buy it, pay for us, you know, and, and I got the 
painting cars. I liked it. Then, I bought this little house down here for 6000 dollars. I built on next to it, a 
little shop. That's how I got started. And it kept growing and growing and, and we've been fortunate. I've 
seen a lot of companies go. Yeah. Still here.  
 
KC  01:19 
And Helene, would you introduce yourself? 
 
HM  01:20 
Yep. I'm Helene O'Neill McCabe, I'm Toby's sister, and I'm the office manager. I answer the phone, take 
your money and pay the bills. That's it, I don't know nothing else about bodywork.  
 
KC  01:36 
So, where was the service station, in Harkers [Island]? 
 
TO  01:41 
No, it was in Beaufort, on Front [corner?] Street, from the courthouse. It was in town, and I'd run that for 
about four years.  
afc2020009_019_sr01—TO interview conducted by KC and JG 
 
2 
 
KC  01:47 
And when did you start there?  
 
TO  01:48 
...Twenty-four, twenty-four seven.... 
 
KC  01:50 
What year? 
 
TO  01:51 
It started in 1967. Now I'd run it for about four years, and I was starting a business in this station, and I 
was painting there. So I just carried it through, started doing it by myself nights or weekends, you know. 
And I worked for the whole company because I had a fleet of trucks. And I would take a truck on the 
weekend and fix it up, paint, stuff like that, for them also. And I just started painting for my friends, to 
get ready. Paint jobs in them days was like $45 to body work paint it. You know, material for painting 
the car when $9.31. I'm sorry, $45 paint job average man, was bringing home about $42 a week, them 
days. Minimum wage had just went to $1 and a quarter/ an hour, right.  
 
TO  02:31 
And now the paint we're using is almost $600 a gallon. And that $45 paint job costs you about $3500, 
now. Because the helpers, $18-20 an hour, and the material is going crazy. And everything's going great, 
as far as parts and I don't have much trouble getting parts especially in this pandemic, lot of people 
staying home and some are making more staying home then they are working. ....and I think the 
Governor finally realized... I watched the news today, 50% of the United States _____ believes in the 
unemployment because they get more spending. I don't know where they're getting it from.  
 
KC  03:15 
So what kind of cars were you painting back in 1967? 
 
TO  03:19 
Anything that had four wheels on it.  
 
HM  03:22 
Had to paint them all.  
 
TO  03:23 
And also, I had a portable unit that I bought. I put a portable [black?] professional on a trailer. And I 
would go to the boat yards, and spray yachts. I'd paint boats on site. And I would charge like $50 an 
hour and a [little 72 foot?] ____ boat works on Harker's Island, and I said I just need one helper, to 
afc2020009_019_sr01—TO interview conducted by KC and JG 
 
3 
handle the hose so I can get back to paint. And I charged $50 an hour, I'd paint that boat in about seven 
and a half hours. So that night I get a man a bill for the $50 an hour, you know, and he felt like, felt like 
I was ripping him off, and a guy that owned the boat, that boat right now probably a $2 million boat. He 
said "Look find your best man." It was like two weeks ago, he's on ______. But paintbrushes and it will 
look like that. And he said by the way, what are you doing tomorrow? Come out paint the _____ copies. 
But I'd paint theater screens, whatever it was. If he'd come out with a fake gun, I was painting. So I had 
a portable trailer, I'd go as far as like Vegas, North Carolina. And the guy Lemay, I'd paint yachts for 
him, you know. And Sally Rose and there was actually no _____ times were rough in the those days, 
you know.  
 
KC  04:22 
Paint movie screens? 
 
TO  04:22 
Yeah, the theater.   
 
TO  04:22 
On Harker's island, they have the theatre, is like a canvas screen. And I gotta just drag the hose out, dry 
it up, and paint it silver, you where we get reflection from. And like I said, if I get that hose that I paint 
it. 
 
KC  04:42 
Like a white square? 
 
KC  04:54 
You make it sound easy. What's the difference of painting a boat and a car? Is there a process that's 
different?  
 
TO  05:02 
Oh. No, no. The boat you know, we have said is just like all that she's about 70 foot. I start up top, paint 
inside the cabinets and everything work myself down. Then get to about 70 foot long and work my self 
back. Because I work with stuff at home and one man was handing me the hoses. 
 
HM  05:22 
Baby, did you use different paint?  
 
TO  05:24 
Oh yeah well this is about the same paint in them days, the best paint they made was _____. 
polyurethane. Nowadays they got this upgrade that from that to_____ your things, all these different 
paints, and waterborne paints, like all kinds of paints. But some are pasty, got the pearl essence, so there 
afc2020009_019_sr01—TO interview conducted by KC and JG 
 
4 
are changes coming to lights. Now some of that stuff costs us $300 or $400 a quart. We had a call the 
other day, we stopped six pearl this year, standard. And I have a new mazda, and they change they got 8 
pearls, got new pearls. Beautiful colors, but to finish that car, we had buy two different pearls, about 
eleven hundred dollars, for two quarts. We have a car right behind it had just 8 again, like your _____. 
Everything's all expensive. And my people come up nowadays and as old folks, I used to work for and 
still customers and one called me the other day says I got it kind of Victorian, want you to paint it for 
me. It's not worth it at one point now, about $250. I was like, "I can't buy the paint for it." 
 
TO  06:33 
I can paint the mirror... 
 
TO  06:34 
The wheel! But everything, is the only explaining, I tell people, as people come here days and a car don't 
really need a the painting, and a detail, you know, and I talk them out of painting. For I saw an old lady 
come here about five years ago, she had a Chevy Vega. Them cars only live to about 50,000 miles, 
about all they go bad. She had about 48,000 miles on it. That car really didn't need painting, and it was 
going to cost about $750 to paint it. And I talked to her, she finally got mad at me she said, "You don't 
really want paint my car do you?" I said I felt like I was holding a gun on you. She called me three 
weeks later and apologized, the motor went bad in it. You know, so I mean I try to treat people I want to 
be treated.  
 
TO  06:37 
And I have a couple that come here, that had a little Toyota. It was white, they wanted it painted red. 
Well it was gonna cost 35 dollars to change the color, you take a door panels and everything out. I said 
you're off you take a 3500, your car is in perfect shape, probably upgrade in two years, for a _____car, 
and get a red car. I could make some money off of it, but I don't feel right about it because the car will 
depreciate probably $1,000 by changing colors to paint it. With all of the hoods off, you can't take that 
stuff off, you gotta black it out is all you can do. So have a lot of capital and they understand, appreciate, 
you know being honest with them you know and if your car don't need painting, I'll tell you the car don't 
need painting. I'm not trying to rip people off, that's why I've been here 54 years.  
 
Julia Gartrell  07:56 
So a lot of natural elements come in play here, because it's very sunny and it's very salty. Do you have to 
take into account... 
 
TO  08:06 
Well I ended up I made my own, had a homemade paint booth I made myself. And ventilation on it. And 
nowadays the insurance companies say stuff take on a five day job, if it takes more than five days, they 
want me to put the rental on the bill. So we got about 52,000 dollar paint booth now. I'm paint some car. 
Matter of fact, I've got one Mercedes, I said, "We'll have it ready for you at 5 o'clock, Friday." He comes 
afc2020009_019_sr01—TO interview conducted by KC and JG 
 
5 
in ____ the shop at 3 o'clock, I said "The car isn't ready yet. It isn't painted, I'm getting ready to paint it." 
He got mad and left. I put his drive at quarter to five. We put it in, we bake it, zap it, take it out and wash 
it off, then you take it home. 
 
KC  08:43 
It takes just a couple hours with the new paints? 
 
TO  08:46 
The paints. I bake it  for 35-40 minutes, then it has to cool down 35-40 to take that ______. 
 
KC  08:52 
So that's so different from when you say.... 
 
TO  08:54 
Yeah you're still with paint, enamel paint was your poison. In them days, didn't know what _____ right I 
got a robot or a cotton ball under my nose, roughly 25-30  dollars. Yeah, no but anyway it's a rough road 
but you have good years, you have bad years. And a couple years there, was abbout to closed doors, and 
but we have survived, God help us. It's just been a long, hard road, but we're still doing it. 
 
HM  09:32 
Doing what he loves. A lawyer asked him, "You aren't making the most money, why are you doing, 
what you doing? He said, "You got love what you do." 
 
TO  09:39 
People say, "When are you going to retire?" I say, "When I get old."  
 
HM  09:43 
He ain't old yet! 
 
KC  09:44 
For the record, you're 78, right? 
 
TO  09:48 
I've been working I can't say if I take a rope IV three foot. I'd be driving the last half a day.  
 
TO  09:55

TO  09:56 
afc2020009_019_sr01—TO interview conducted by KC and JG

The work ethic. They never had to do it, because it's been handed down to them, you know. We come up 
hard, didn't have anything, we've just had to work with what we have, nobody give us nothing, you 
know? And a matter of fact, when we first came up, they had just -- we didn't  have electricity on the

And plastic, right?

 Yep. Y'all get bumpers that are plastic. And we got plastic weld with weld and placement and bumper 
restore we can weld them all together. But all that's not price feasible, you know. My ball rate 
recondition or cheap I can do it. And probably 95% of my work now is insurance work, that individual 
pays. And so many cars out there, at the end of --- about now everybody got insurance on their cars. A

car but insurance only giving her $18,000 for the car. Don't have the gap insurance. That's what that 
does. When we buy a new car, we buy gap insurance, because you buy a car off the lot...
