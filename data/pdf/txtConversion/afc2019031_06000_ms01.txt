Interview 
Sarah Filkins: This is Sarah Filkins, Interviewer speaking with Roberta Washington, FAIA, on 
Sunday, July 26, 2020. Ms. Washington and I were originally scheduled to meet at the offices of 
Roberta Washington Architects, PC, in March. Due to the covid pandemic we are now recording 
remotely. Today Roberta Washington is in her home office in New York City and I am in my 
home office in Washington, DC. Good afternoon, Roberta.   
            
Roberta Washington: Good afternoon. 
SF: 
Thank you for agreeing to share your story with us as part of the [Library of Congress] 
American Folklife Center, Occupation Folklife Project funded by an Archie Green Fellowship.  
So let’s start. Please state your full name, year of birth and place of birth for archival reference. 
RW: 
Roberta Devon Washington. Greensboro, North Carolina well actually Goldsboro, North 
Carolina is the place of birth. But I grew up  in Greensboro. My date of birth is 
 
1947. 
SF: 
Great. Thank you. So what is your current work position and what are your job 
responsibilities? 
RW: 
I am principal of an architectural firm, small though it is, it’s a firm. And there are five of 
us. There is an associate who along with myself runs the firm. And we do the major marketing 
and designing and running projects and there are three draftspersons who back us up and make 
the drawing part possible.  
SF: 
Well let’s look back a little bit to growing up. When did you first become aware of 
architecture and the built environment? 
RW: 
I became aware of architecture I think in the eighth grade and I’m not sure I was aware of 
it at all before. Until then I was just really interested in art and I thought that what I wanted to be 
when I grew up was an artist. And I had a class assignment once which was to interview three 
people who had occupations that you think you would be interested in. And since I was really 
narrowly focused, I was only really interested in art and so I found an art teacher to interview 
and I found another person to interview. I can’t even remember what that person was. But I 
wanted an artist to interview and I was told that there were no such things in Greensboro, North 
Carolina, at least people of color, either architects or artists. But I only knew about artists. And so 
for the third person, I was begging my mom to help me and she suggested that I interview a 
neighbor next door, someone who was renting the neighbor’s house for a year. And that person 
was an architect and it was a Black professor at A&T College. And so I was just desperate to 
interview someone to have a third person so anyone would have done, I think. But I spoke to this 
Roberta Washington Interview, July 26, 2020two-ﬁrst
Women Architects, afc2019/031

guy who was good enough to see me for about a half an hour and in that time he changed my 
life. He told me what architecture was and he convinced me that, that was something that I really 
should be doing. I told him I was interested in art and he asked me why was I interested in art. 
And I said, “Because with art you could create beautiful pictures, beautiful scenes—that it was 
something people could enjoy and I enjoyed doing it and I liked creating.” And he said, “Well, 
then you definitely should be doing architecture because if you were doing architecture not only 
would you create something beautiful, something that people could enjoy,  but also something 
that could be of use to people. They could learn in the buildings that you create. They could heal 
in buildings that you create. Just think, it’s so much more expensive than art.” And that was kind 
of it. So not only was that my third interview but like I said, it changed my life because until then 
I had never even heard of architects much less met one. And here  
[00:05:00] 
was one who was so convincing that this was a career for people who maybe wanted to create 
things that looked good but also there was an opportunity to in some way serve society. And so I 
was sold. 
SF: 
What did your Mom think when you told her you wanted to be an architect? 
RW: 
Well, she was okay with that. I’m not sure if my mother really even, really understood. I 
meant to ask her. She’s passed now. But I meant to really ask her if she even knew what he did, 
you know, or just because the word architecture started with something that sounded like art. I 
don’t know if she knew or not. But she was—but my mother backed me and my other siblings in 
whatever it was we said we wanted to become because she had spent most of her life doing day 
work which is working in white folks’s kitchens and homes as a maid. And she had had other 
aspirations and hadn’t been able to achieve them and so she was especially concerned that her 
daughters should not follow her, in her footsteps, and so whatever we were interested in she 
supported us like a hundred percent. And in fact my guidance counselor did not want to send in 
my application to study architecture at a couple of colleges that I thought I wanted to submit 
because she said that, you know, like they’re—I mean this was a—I have to back up and say that 
Greensboro at that period was a very segregated city and so I went to an all Black high school. I 
mean I never thought of it as all Black because everything I did, was like all Black. I lived in an 
all Black neighborhood. I went to all Black schools. The churches were all Black. So I hardly 
realized that there was another society but I knew that most people had never seen or heard of a 
Black architect. And the guidance counselor thought that that would be like, near impossible so 
she was like the opposite of encouraging. And she thought I should pick something more 
practical. And but my Mom helped me do the application for Howard University which I found 
out about because the AIA [American Institute of Architects] had published a pamphlet called—
it was a little tiny pamphlet but it was called “So You Want To Be An Architect”. It was in the 
library. And I read that pamphlet from cover to cover, like I can’t tell you how many times. And I 
tried to do everything it said to do in there. It said you should take a foreign language and so I 
did when I was in high school just because it said that you should do that—that that’s what 
Roberta Washington Interview, July 26, 2020two-ﬁrst
Women Architects, afc2019/031
5
people who studied architecture did. Crazy as it was, I believed that. And so I worked with my 
Mom. She did all the applications. We applied there. We applied for one other school to study art 
but the only place I really thought I’d go or wanted to go was to Howard and study architecture. 
SF:  
How wonderful that you had such a supportive Mom and then that you had this chance 
encounter with the next door neighbor. Did you ever let him know that you actually did become 
an architect? 
RW: 
Oh my God, yes, yes, yes! And it was a very strange encounter. Yes, I was at the mall 
once when I had graduated and I had gotten licensed and I was working my first or second or 
third job or something. And I was in Greensboro visiting and I was with my Mom at the mall and 
she pointed Mr. Gray out. His name was Mr. Gray. I can’t remember his first name but—and she 
says, “There’s Professor Gray. That’s the guy who you interviewed.” And I was like, “What! Are 
you sure that’s him?” I mean I hardly—I didn’t recognize him. But I ran up to him and I said,    
“Oh Mr. Gray, Mr. Gray, do you remember you—I interviewed you—you let me interview you 
for my class assignment?” And I said whatever year it was and I said, “Do you remember? You 
know that interview, it changed my life.” I said, “Because of what you said I studied architecture 
and I became an architect and now I’m licensed, you know?” And I said, “It’s all because of 
you.” And then he was like silent for a while and then he sort of looked at me and he wasn’t 
smiling or anything and he said, “You know, if I’d known you were going to take it so seriously  
[00:10:00] 
I would have told you the truth.” But then I knew what he meant. It was the things he didn’t say 
that if he’d said, I’m not sure. You know because the truth is, it was hard, it was harder than I 
thought when I talked to him. The truth is you don’t get rich, as rich as you’re dreaming you can 
become in doing what you think is a profession where everybody is like making money. And the 
truth is, you know, it’s hard and it takes lots of work and producing a project isn’t an easy job. 
And the truth is if you’re Black and female and in a profession in which even if you’re just one 
of those things it’s hard. Having both of those strikes against you can make it harder. But I 
thanked him and I was just really happy and I just said, You know, then I’m glad you didn’t. It’s 
all right. I didn’t need to know all of that.” And now if people ask me, I don’t say everything that 
I could say about what it can be to be in the profession. Because I think that people who ask are 
people who I sort of take them at their word. That that’s what they want to do and the reasons 
that people want to be—have certain occupations or work in certain things—I think that doesn’t 
really have anything to do with how much money you’re making, how hard it is. Because 
otherwise if that was the case then who’d be working in health care? Who would be teaching 
schools especially elementary where you have to buy your own supplies? I mean, you know, 
there are some jobs that people want because they want to give or do and participate or be a part 
of what they recognize as something that for them is a beneficial occupation. It’s something that 
they get something out of and maybe it’s serving people, maybe it’s being creative, but people 
have to see something that they could get out of that occupation before they choose it. And so 
when people choose architecture, I mean I don’t think that they’re—I think that the reasons are 
Roberta Washington Interview, July 26, 2020two-ﬁrst
Women Architects, afc2019/031
6
the right reasons for them and I think that they deserve a chance and they should give themselves 
a chance and so I want to give them a chance.  
SF: 
Very good. Well, so you got into Howard University. 
RW: 
Yes 
SF: 
And then started the program there. As you got into your classes and your studios what 
were your thoughts about architecture and your goals for the future? Did you know of anyone 
that—you thought I’ll start my own practice, or I’ll work for a big firm. 
RW: 
No, no I didn’t really—I never thought about starting my own firm ever. That was like 
the farthest thing from my mind. All I was thinking was that no, I’d like to graduate and get a 
good job. So I never thought about starting a firm. But even when I was at Howard we had very 
little exposure to practice. I mean most of the teachers or at least half of the teachers practiced, 
had their own firms. But we didn’t know much about them. And it’s one of the things I really am 
sorry about because later on I found that some of the teachers—about the history, I found out 
about the history of some of the teachers—and I wish I had known and asked them. And I just 
saw them, like you know, mostly elderly, slow walking guys who’d been beat down or something 
by architecture. I don’t know. But now I see or read about them and I see that they had exciting 
lives and that they were trying and that they were working and teaching and they were really 
very dedicated to educating a crop of Black folks who thought they wanted to become architects. 
And this was a time, when I chose Howard, Howard was only one of two—I think there were 
fifty colleges at the time that taught—that had approved schools of architecture and Howard was 
one of two. I can’t think of the other. It may have been Hampton, I don’t know. But  
SF: 
 One of two that what? 
RW: 
One of two historically Black universities and colleges. And this was like just before the 
period where it was becoming more common for black folks to be able to get into white 
universities—the universities which were white,  
[00:15:00] 
had white students mostly at the time. So when I started Howard I never really thought about 
applying to any other, any white schools of architecture because I didn’t think that—I didn’t 
know of any people who’d ever gone to any of those schools—or heard of anyone. But I had 
heard of people going to Howard. And I could read about Howard and like they’re Black 
magazines: the Ebony of the time and the Jet magazines of the time. And so when I saw Howard 
listed as a school in that little pamphlet, “So you want to be an Architect” yeah, I thought that 
that was something I could do. Yeah so that’s what I tried and you know, it never occurred to me 
that I wouldn’t get in but of course not everybody got in. But I think that it was a good place for 
Roberta Washington Interview, July 26, 2020two-ﬁrst
Women Architects, afc2019/031
7
me to be. And so I think I excelled there. But going to any school I suppose is the same in terms 
of new things and stuff. 
SF: 
As you became more involved with your studio classes and your studies what was it that 
you really loved about architecture? Was it design, construction, was it the creative part, the 
technology, the building part? 
RW: 
It was—I loved to design because that was what attracted me to the profession and so I 
loved to design. And I—and there was a teacher, one of the first year teachers, Kenneth, I can’t 
think of his last name—who was like a really challenging person who had a really hard job and 
that is trying to explain to a bunch of kids who’ve just come out of high school what the 
profession of architecture really entailed. But one of the parts of it was design. And I got that 
part. But then we learned all of the other things you had to know to put it together. And so the 
first year was really rough just because I came from a high school where girls did not take 
drafting courses. They did not take mechanical—it was called mechanical engineering or drafting
—mechanical engineering drafting and so I’d never been in a drafting room or touched anything 
that had to do with drafting although guys at my high school had. And so I felt like I was starting 
from behind on day one and so the first year was rough but then I caught up. And by the second 
or the third year I won like design awards and best student design awards and then by the third 
and the fourth year I won scholarships. Of course, until then it was like I had a loan and I 
worked. And my Mom and my Father sent me whatever they could. So then I got into it and the 
more I tried and as time passed the more I felt like, yes this is for me! And I can do this, this is 
something I can manage and understand.  
SF: 
Were there a number of women in your class as well?  
RW: 
There were eight women in my class—there were eight of us and that was one of the 
largest classes of women that they’d had. And I think that was eight out of fifty something, I 
think it was fifty or fifty-two or something. But there were eight. And, yeah it was a good class 
and so I was friendly with the women. We had no female teachers as I hear was true of many 
other universities too. But we had no female teachers and we had no female role models but we 
were good for each other. And I think, I mean and I never really recognized or thought that 
Howard that had a department that was especially sexist, even though I said  
[00:20:00] 
there were no women [faculty]. But then it was only after I graduated and looked back at some 
things that I thought they were not exactly equal between the sexes. Well, the fact that first we 
never had female instructors and that I only went to my advisor one time. I never went back to 
my advisor in five years I was there. Because the first time I went he said something like, “You 
know most of you would be better in home economics or something.” And I never went back, 
that was it. I did not need an advisor if that’s how he felt. So I never saw him again. And it was 
only, I mean I guess it’s just…

SF: 
So then after Howard, what prompted you to go on and get your graduate degree. 
RW: 
Oh, well, so I wasn’t planning to get a graduate degree at all. I was really satisfied by—
would have been satisfied with just graduating from Howard but—oh I wanted to say just one 
other thing that happened before I left that I only realized later on was—could be considered 
discriminatory in terms of male/female. I was looking back at pictures that I had, long after I’d 
graduated, and it reminded me that when we did have speakers, mostly white architects, male, 
white male architects would come and lecture at Howard. That I saw this picture of several of the 
female students and myself and we were standing around a punch bowl and I remembered that 
when we did have these lecturers come, the guys, some of the guys would go off and go pick up 
the speaker and the female students would serve punch and cookies when they came so we 
missed that conversation that they had in the car when they picked them up. We were never part 
of a group that ever went to pick up any speakers and but no one ever thought about it as sexist—
and I didn’t either at the time. And it’s only in hindsight when I look back that I see that—I think 
sexism can exist anywhere and it’s not sort of confined to one kind of a school. Anyway so but I 
didn’t want to go to a—I wasn’t thinking of going to graduate school. So I got a scholarship a 
couple of years in a row from Smith Hinchman and Grylls and they used to come and lecture all 
the time at Howard. They were one of the main lecturers at the school of architecture. And they 
had set up the scholarship fund that I won a couple of years in a row. I got their scholarship. And 
so I wanted to go to work on a project that they were doing. Later on I sort of figured out that the 
reason that they were always hanging around—I don’t want to say that this was the reason that 
they were giving out scholarships and things and very generous—but they were trying to get the 
new hospital project for Howard University. And in my summers I had worked at the Department 
of Health. I didn’t work in an architect’s office. I never got a job in an architect’s office but I got 
a job in the Department of Health as the Health Facilities Planner. Well, as an assistant to a 
health facilities planner. And I really liked that and I understood that. And so when I heard that 
Smith Hinchman and Grylls were going to be the architects for the new campus hospital, 
Freedman’s Hospital, on Howard University’s campus, I wanted to work on that project. And but 
they were in Detroit so I asked them if I could come to Detroit and work. And they said, “Yeah.” 
And so they hired me and I went to Detroit and I worked on that big huge hospital project. But it 
was like my first job in an architect’s office and I suppose I did what you do if it was your first 
job in an architect’s office. I did tons of bathroom designs and I did designs here and there, on 
every floor, and I was getting really very fed up with it. And it was a huge firm. I think it was 
like five hundred people in one building or something. It was some huge number of people. It 
was the largest number of architects in a single spot. But they were in that five hundred or how 
many other—there were only like maybe five or six or seven  
[00:25:00] 
Black folks but one was an associate, was a director, not a director, an associate or something, 
and anyway I went to him and complained that this isn’t what I came to Detroit to do. I didn’t 
come to this firm to do this and I know more and I should be allowed to do more and I was just 
Roberta Washington Interview, July 26, 2020two-ﬁrst

going crazy about it and just going off at the mouth and he just sort of said, “Well, I don’t see 
why you think anybody should let you do any more. You’ve only been out of school so many 
months. Why would anybody give you any major design stuff?” And I said, “But I know about 
health and I was working with it in the summers.” And he said, “Oh, that doesn’t count.” And 
then he said, “If you really wanted to improve your chances you’d have to improve your 
knowledge.” And I was saying, “Well how can I do that? How can I learn something like that?” 
And he said, “Columbia University has a school of hospital design.” That it was called—what 
was it called—Hospital and Health Facility Design. It was a one year program and it was a 
master in science degree program and so that sounded great. And so I took that advice and I, well 
this was before the day—this was when you actually had to sit down and write a letter. You had 
to find an address, I don’t even know how I did it. You had to find an address, you have to write 
a letter. So I wrote to the school and they sent me an application and I filled out the application 
and I sent it back and they said okay. And then I wrote them another letter and asked them if it 
was possible to have a—how could I get a scholarship and if they’d give me a scholarship. And 
so they said yes. And so they gave me a scholarship for the tuition and then they said that I could 
sign up for their work program. I’ve forgotten what it was called but they had a student work 
program where they found jobs and assigned people to work outside of the university. So that 
was what I did. And so I only stayed in Detroit for well, less than a year and as soon (NOISE) as 
I found out I was going, I packed up and I came here to New York. And that was how I ended up 
at Columbia. And the interesting thing is that I happened to come at the same time as dozens of 
students who were part of a program which for years I thought I was part of….And that was the 
program that I guess was using Ford Foundation grant money to pay for recruitment of Black 
students to go to Columbia. But I was not recruited. I was begging to go. I already knew what I 
wanted. But I was there at the time of the largest number probably of Black students who ever 
attended Columbia University at one time. And so I was just there for one year, so I thought that 
that was normal. And it was only after I left, years later, I met some kids who were—some guys 
from the Dominican Republic who were there and who were upset because—they had asked me 
to come back to help them. They wanted me to work with them on a Black History Month 
program and they said that they had heard that Black students used to go there. And I said, “Yes, 
of course we went there, I went there. There were a whole bunch of us, you know.” And then I 
said, “You know, and the head of the department was Max Bond, a Black man.” And they went, 
“Wow, you mean a Black man was the head of the school of architecture?”, department of 
architecture I guess it was. And they were amazed and then I told them that as early as 1923 there 
were Black folks who were graduating and that John Lewis Wilson had gone to Columbia. And 
they were like (gasp) they just couldn’t believe it because in their class they were the only two 
and they’d never heard of any Black folks going there before. And if you go there today you 
would not have known that there could have ever been a time when there were thirty or forty 
Black folks walking around as if they owned the place. But anyway, so that’s how I ended up at 
Columbia in graduate school. 
SF: 
Did you have any mentors there 
[00:30:00] 
Roberta Washington Interview, July 26, 2020two-ﬁrst
Women Architects, afc2019/031
10
or in undergraduate that impacted… 
RW: 
Well, I would say that when I was at Howard, I mean I guess you have to make your own 
mentors, you know? In a way I never had a conversation with anyone and said, “Will you be my 
mentor?” or whatever. But I would look at some people and decide that hey, whatever they’re 
doing I want to do what you’re doing, because I think it’s working out okay for them. So I would 
talk to people. I would try to talk to architects who I admired or who I thought I could learn 
something from but I don’t think that they knew that they were my mentors. For instance Max 
Bond was I guess just like a secret Santa. He was my secret mentor, he didn’t know. But I sort of 
thought that what he did and how he did it led to where he was and so I—when I was at 
Columbia one of the most influential things in my entire life happened—and that was that I went 
with him and some other students on a trip to Ghana. And at first, before that I mean, I hardly 
ever saw these students because my class was in hospital design and we had our separate 
building and it was off-campus. But every now and then when I found out there were all of these 
Black students over there, I’d go to the school of architecture. And one time I was there Max 
asked me to sign a petition and he was petitioning the school to let a group of Black—or 
whoever, it wasn’t Black, it wasn’t like only Black students—but he was saying for students to 
be able to use their Kenny Fellowship money to take a group trip to Ghana for a month and that 
he would be the guide. And Max had worked in Ghana before. He worked for [Kwame] 
Nkrumah, the first president and he was doing projects for the state, and he was an architect for 
the state. And I was like really impressed with that. Anyway, I didn’t really want to go to Africa 
at the time because I still had not gotten it—that whole thing about Africa is where you need to 
go if you’re Black. You need to see where you—I don’t know—I hadn’t quite gotten into that. 
And so I reluctantly went and the thing is that they really had trouble getting students to go 
because not a lot of students had made the whole Black Power turn to we should return or go 
visit Africa or think of ourselves as Africans. Anyway but I went because hey, it’s a free trip. 
You’re not putting up a lot or any money and here is a chance to be with Max who’d worked 
there and to see what he did. And once I got there, I was just so, so impressed and so, so thankful 
that I actually went because then I started thinking, I almost missed this. And it was for me sort 
of like a personal awakening. And just understanding what he did and he showed us—we did 
tours to cities where he actually did projects and we visited the University of Kumasi where they 
taught architecture and so it was like really great to see whole schools of Black folk studying 
architecture. And it also though, influenced me to think about doing something like that and so I 
started thinking of where could I go in Africa. I thought then—I like the idea that he spent time 
working in a country that was newly independent and that he was making a contribution there 
and all of that. I thought that was okay. Anyway, but I started thinking about it and it just sort of 
stayed on my mind. And then I thought ,Okay, if I wanted to do something like that where would 
I go? And I thought I could go back to where he was but it didn’t quite work out because there 
were still—politically there were some tough problems and so when I’d have an interview with 
somebody about working there and leave the country, and go away and come back six months 
later that person might be in prison, bloodless coup, but in prison. And then I’d go away, I’d 
Roberta Washington Interview, July 26, 2020two-ﬁrst

11
come back and then those people were out and more people were in charge and so I didn’t think 
that was going to quite work 
[00:35:00] 
but I became interested in African liberation groups and what was happening in southern Africa 
especially. And I eventually applied to work in Mozambique which had just become independent 
after I got my [architecture] license. I got my license in 75 and in 77, I went to work in 
Mozambique where I worked for the government in the Public Works Department designing 
schools and health facilities. And so in a way I got to kind of replay what I think Max’s early 
career in Ghana must have been like. And that is working for a newly formed government where 
you as an architect, they are so happy to see you. You really are appreciated as an architect. And 
you get to do work you like and to feel like you are contributing more than just a building. 
You’re contributing something to a society. And so I did that for four and a half years and then I 
came back to the states.  
SF: 
So you really had a lot of wonderful experience at that point actually designing schools 
and hospitals, just what you had wanted to do when you were in Detroit. 
RW: 
Yeah, well when I got out of—when I graduated from Columbia. I graduated at a time 
when there was a recession. I guess in architecture, it’s like almost every couple of years there’s 
a recession or something. But so I graduated when there was a recession and my first job was 
with the professor who taught the hospital design class. And but although he had been in 
business for ten years before, he ended up closing his business after I was there for six months. 
So I went to that place and that was the end of his business. So then I went to another company 
and I was there for almost a year and they closed. Well, they had a big—it was an office that was 
based in Texas and—CRS, Caudill, Rowlett and Scott or something like that. But then they 
closed and took their office—they left New York and they went back to where they came from 
and then I—so I worked for several firms that were just in business for a little while and went out 
of business. I worked for—and then I worked for one Black firm, Black-owned firm, and that 
firm had been business for many, many years and then they also went out of business. And so I 
think what I got out of that is that you really have to sort of be like, I don’t know, rough and 
tough and you can’t have thin skin. That to survive as an employee in New York City is not so 
easy. And the Black firm I worked for was Ifill, Johnson Hanchard which is a firm that—they did 
in New York City the State Office Building, lots of other projects. They did a swimming pool in 
Harlem and they did projects in other parts of the city outside of Harlem, big projects. And so 
they were coming along but recessions can hit all kinds of firms that seem to be successful. So 
once again I saw something that did not make me want to own a firm. I mean it’s like so far 
nothing I’ve seen really made me think that I really wanted to have a firm of my own but when I 
came back from Mozambique I worked for more architecture firms specializing in hospitals and 
so I did that and I think my desire, my intent was just to work in those firms forever. I could have 
just worked there forever. I didn’t really think about starting a firm. But some things happened 
like first of all, because like as I say

[00:40:00] 
architecture always seemed to be either going into or coming out of a recession or something and 
I remember all of the times when you’d be in these big offices and sometimes when things were 
bad and you’d see how it changed the culture and how some people were—there were some 
people just so affected by the thought of losing their job that it drove them crazy. And others, I 
guess, I mean I survived but sometimes it was just if you didn’t have a really good sense of 
humor it was really hard—like being at a big firm where you know they’re laying off people and 
so you are just wondering when is it going to be your time. And every Friday before lunch they 
would lay off people and they would—and so like it was just a really tense time and the boss or 
the director would be walking through the firm and you’re thinking Whose desk is he going to 
stop at? And you’re hoping it’s not your desk and then one day it is your time and then they say, 
“Hey, Washington can we speak to you in the conference room?” And you know that when 
people went in, they never came out. But still, I just thought that that was culture. That was the 
way it was and still I didn’t think of starting a firm. So I think that what made me think of 
starting a firm was that I seem to have—I get to have work regular and that was because I was 
specializing in hospitals and health facilities and at that time in New York they were doing a lot 
of hospitals and health facilities and so those types of skills were always in demand. So I seemed 
to always come up with a job. I always had jobs and things but then what I noticed was I didn’t 
really move up in firms. The only way I thought I succeeded or did better or got more pay was if 
I left that firm and went to another firm. But I could never seem to move up where I was. Even 
if, well sometimes I brought in people or I recommended people who I’d worked with in other 
firms who had health facility skills and they’d come. But sometimes I’d train them, right, so that 
they could do the kind of work that the particular firm that I worked at wanted. And at the last 
place I was, I had trained two people who came in and one was a woman who moved ahead of 
me. And I didn’t think it was because she knew more, I thought that it was because she got along 
with the people who were the bosses, the people who were in charge, better than I did. It’s like so 
it wasn’t just work, it was like can you tell your supervisor a joke in the elevator to break the 
silence when you’re going from the lobby to your floor. And then I realized I couldn’t. I mean I 
could talk to my colleagues but I really didn’t feel at ease like just talking to my, as we call them, 
boss. It was like I just didn’t feel comfortable and I couldn’t imagine them joking with them 
either. And I don’t know, and it occurred to me that if I couldn’t do that I wasn’t going to ever be 
anything more. I was just looking to be an associate but at that time in all of the city I only knew 
of one Black person who was an associate in an architectural firm that wasn’t owned by Black 
folks. And so I did not think that that was—I wasn’t seeing moving up in the firm as a real 
possibility. That’s what it was. So then I had to decide did I just want to stay where I was and I 
figured I could get jobs. I could just go from place to place but I really wasn’t going to—I 
couldn’t see how I could advance and so I then decided maybe I had to look at something else 
because if I was willing to spend however many hours it was working in someones office then 
maybe I should devote that time to my own firm. Maybe I should try to do it myself. That was 
when I thought I should. And so I heard about a project—and it was a project in Harlem

Women Architects, afc2019/031

45 
and so it was like really like hard to get still because I didn’t really have a firm and I didn’t have 
an office but I’d just heard about a project. And I knew someone who knew someone who knew 
about this project and so that person sort of helped me make some connections. And the reason 
the project was available is because it was a project—this guy was a Black guy who was an 
associate in a white owned, well it wasn’t a whited owned, it was what was considered at the 
time the largest minority owned firm but it wasn’t Black but it was the largest minority and so 
that firm did all of the minority work when people didn’t really want to hire Black firms they 
could hire this firm which was an hispanic firm. But he didn’t want that job and so my friend 
who was an associate in that firm told me that I should try to find out about it. And so I went to, 
there used to be in Harlem the, Oh gosh what was it called—HUDC Harlem Urban Development 
Corporation had an office in Harlem and so I went and asked about that project and if it were 
possible. And these folks had never heard of me even though I lived a few blocks from their 
office. But I’d never heard of them either but it turns out that they had some influence in terms of 
projects that had state funding and that was a project that had state funding and so I convinced 
them or tried to convince them that I was totally capable of doing that project even though I had 
no idea what it involved. I just knew it was a project and I didn’t really know. But so I got that 
project because the person who—the friend who told me about the project stuck around and told 
like me what a proposal was. Because I didn’t really know. I’d never done one. So I went to see 
the people at HUDC and they said well you know you’ll have to do a proposal and you’ll have to 
give us four copies of a proposal. And can you do that by Friday and I was like, “Sure!” And then 
I had to run out. And I was like What is a proposal? What are they asking me for? What do they 
want? And then he showed me an example of a proposal that this other architect who he had 
worked for had and so I came up with a proposal. And I had to say my home was my office and I 
had to give references and I had worked on something with a contractor in Harlem and so I used 
that project as a—it was a house that he was doing and so I was the architect but that was Georg 
Blake, off the books. Anyway, so I used that and I got the job and so that was my first job and it 
was a four million dollar hotel residence—a residential hotel rather, for the Vera Institute of 
Justice and it was for I think ninety some people. And it was basically, it was a homeless 
program providing housing for the homeless. But it was in a landmarked building, well at the 
time it wasn’t so I wrote part of the section to send to the state to get the building designated as a 
state and a national landmark. And so I designed that building and that was my first job and then 
because I did that other projects followed that were similar. So I did project for homeless, several 
projects for homeless, women—ex drug offenders and their children. I did something for the 
women’s prison association which was for women and children housing. So I did several of those 
projects and I did projects for recovering alcoholics and then I did a project for Volunteers of 
America down on twenty—I think it was Twenty-Third Street or, something near there which 
was for HIV positive adults, like a hundred 
[00:50:00]

14
apartments. And so I did several of those and then it was like hard to get out of that because once 
you can do one thing then it’s really hard to do something else. And then I finally got to do some 
health facilities but only with, mostly with other firms. Anyway, so I did some health care 
projects and then I did schools—I started doing schools and I got a couple—I did three schools 
in New Haven, Connecticut and five schools in Mt. Vernon, New York. And then I did one 
school in New York, New York by myself and we were associated with other architects on the 
others but the only one I really count is the one that I did myself in Brooklyn. And so I then just 
kept doing marketing for a variety of things, always looking for healthcare, sometimes getting it 
but then doing housing and I graduated from housing for the homeless to condominiums and I 
did one of the—I think it was the first “green” building in Harlem which was 1400 Fifth Avenue 
and I did the first “green” school in New Haven which was Barnard [Elementary]. And so those 
are the things I did and so this is what I was doing and I had up to sometimes—I guess the 
largest was when I had sixteen employees and the smallest is probably now. And so now, I work 
but I’m also thinking of how I can write and I’m interested in writing about Black architects of 
New York and I also want to as a book, I think that could be a book. And I also am interested in 
research and writing or doing a website about Black women architects in the country. And so 
that’s my career in a nutshell. 
SF: 
Well, could you also talk about the African Burial Ground Interpretive Center? 
RW: 
Yes, I can African Burial Ground Interpretive Center—so there’s a story behind the story, 
really. I can’t remember the year that the bones were first discovered but I know from that point 
on I wanted to do that project but of course that’s nothing because I’m sure lots of people, many 
architects wanted to do that project. This was the Park Service project in New York and they had 
several sort of false starts in terms of how to give the project out. So originally the first time I 
went after it, I was on the team with a big firm in Philadelphia and then another time I was on 
another team with someone else in New York and that didn’t pan out. I mean not just for me. But 
it didn’t work out for the park service in terms of how it was going. And so this is like over 
several years but then the last time I heard about it, it was a call, I can’t remember from where 
but a big firm in either Philadelphia or someone else but it was out of New York called and asked 
if I would be on their team and my first—and they said—several people had asked me if I’d be 
on their team—and usually I don’t like that because it just means that well—I don’t want to say 
it means that people are using you. But yes it means that people are just using you to get the job. 
And I’m thinking that this is like the smallest job in the world. It’s like ten-thousand square feet. 
Now if a small Black firm can’t do ten-thousand square feet then they should be shot, why are 
they here? What is the point? So how is that? So this firm said—so I talked to several people 
who asked us to be on their team but this one firm said okay, you know what, if we get the job, if 
you’ll be on our team, if we get the job 
[00:55:00] 
we’ll just give it to you. But the way the proposal is written they said, it can only go to people 
who already have a contract with the National Park Service, right. And so we’re one of the 
Roberta Washington Interview, July 26, 2020two-ﬁrst
Women Architects, afc2019/031
15
people who already have the contracts and so that’s why we got the proposal. But we’d like to 
help you if you want to help us. But you can get it, you can have it, you can do it. And so I said 
okay. But still it sort of bothered me and I wondered, How could it be that a small firm couldn’t 
have a chance to do a small job? Why should they use the people already on their list for 
everything? And so I kept saying to the architect when he’d ask—the Park Service People had 
asked if I had any questions. And I said, “Yes, I do have questions, I’d like to talk to them. I’d 
like to ask them.” And of course they wouldn’t talk to me. But he said that they said you should 
tell me. So I told him that my question was that. And so I said I wanted to talk to them about that. 
And so they never wanted to talk but then they canceled the whole thing and they started a new 
thing. And the new request for proposals just said that you should be a small firm and so 
somehow I got invited, imagine that. Not just because I said anything but I got invited. And so I 
did a proposal. I spent like a zillion hours and lots of manpower to do a proposal that could 
convince them that I could do a ten thousand square foot building. Never mind that I had already 
done buildings that were fifty-thousand square feet. I could do a ten-thousand square foot 
building and so we got it and it was a great project because again it involved history and I was 
interested in the historical part and was—and became really good friends with Marsha Goodson 
who was one of the women who was a researcher from the beginning. And so we attended all of 
the meetings and we did our input although there were exhibit designers. What we wanted was to 
make the interior reflect what we thought, we being the design team both for the architectural 
and for the exhibit, what we thought a viewer of the monument outside needed to know to 
understand the place of that monument in history. And to understand what it was all about. And if 
you just saw the monument and if you didn’t come into the interpretive center then you would 
have really wasted some time because you could have known so much more by seeing it all. And 
so the exhibit tells the history of—something of the history of Black folks in New York City and 
it’s always such a surprise to people because most people can’t think of there being a period 
when there were slaves in New York City, that seems so crazy, right? And that, yes, separateness 
extended to where you laid your head to rest at the end, right. So the burial grounds were 
separate and not always separate and equal and one of the equal things was that if you were 
Black and you lived during that period, when you got buried, there was no guarantee that there 
would be markers to say that you were here, right. And so what happened of course, is that they 
were building that new federal office building and kept encountering bones which they tried to 
hide but people, some people wouldn’t let it go and so there we are. Yes, and so it was like a—it 
was an incredible for me it was a little tiny job and one of the smallest I ever had but it was just 
like really important to be a part of something that had that kind of significance to African 
Americans but also  
[01:00:00] 
to the city and to say something to people who were interested in the history of the city that they 
couldn’t find anywhere else. And so there it is all wrapped up in one building. 
SF: 
Were you also responsible for the actual language and content of the interpretation or 
were you were working with an organization to do that? 
Roberta Washington Interview, July 26, 2020two-ﬁrst

RW: 
No we had exhibit designers and I can’t think of their name right now and what we did 
was we attended meetings once a week with people from the city, people from the National Park 
Service and they had a committee make up of interested residents who had input. And so we had 
input but we didn’t have really any great input except in the layout and the flow and the physical 
spaces that contained the exhibits. The words and the figures that you see came about because 
the exhibit designers proposed something and then the committee either said yes or no. For 
instance the committee—the exhibit designers if they’d had their way, would have had the 
museum only have say figures cut out of big plexiglas as a profile figure but one-dimensional 
figures, right. And they said, “Well, we can’t have people with faces and things because we 
wouldn’t be being truthful to our profession because we don’t know what those people looked 
like.”  But I understood when folks from the—who were representing the City or the 
communities in the City were saying, “No, we need to see people who look like Black people. 
We don’t want to see a cutout of a glass figure representing something. No, this is our time to 
show that they…” And they [the exhibit designers] would say, “But we don’t know what…” It 
doesn’t matter. Like I understood that and I’m glad that we have…when you see it now you see 
that there are figures. It’s like the wax museum, whatever, but they have figures that represent—
and I think that that is really important and it wouldn’t be the same if you just had the clothes on 
a silhouette  of something (technical difficulties with interviewee’s mic and headset).  
SF: 
So how about—you belonged to some organizations including NOMA, National 
Organization of Minority Architects and New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, 
and the Central Harlem Community Planning Board. Could you talk a little bit about your work 
with some of those organizations? 
RW: 
Well some people are joiners and others, I have lots of friends who say that they would 
never join anything if they had to actually work for free to be on. But I always liked the idea of 
being involved in things so I think I’m like a natural joiner of certain things anyway. So when I 
first came to New York—this was coming back from Mozambique, I mean when I first came and 
started my firm, I was interested in being a part of groups that were architects so I went to the 
AIA when they were on Madison Avenue, I guess that was in the mid-eighties of something and I 
wanted to join but interesting thing then—if you were a woman and just went to the AIA and said 
you wanted to join then they’d tell you when the next meeting of women who were architects or 
wanted to be architects were meeting. So for the next couple of years I’d go all of the time to the 
meeting of women in architecture. And I never even knew that I could have gone to other 
meetings there because no one ever directed me to anything except that. So I went like once 
every two weeks or something and they had meetings  
[01:05:00] 
and so I was with all of these women who were taking about architecture and some of them had 
firms and all of that. And that was at a time when they started—some women did start another 
organization and I think it was something like—it wasn’t Women in Architecture but it was 
Roberta Washington Interview, July 26, 2020two-ﬁrst
Women Architects, afc2019/031
17
something similar to that. And that was like something I had joined before I left for Mozambique 
and to get my—when I got licensed I think it was because I used to belong to an organization 
called Allied—I think it was Allied for Women in Architecture (AWA). I think that’s what it was 
and they encouraged women to get licensed and they helped you. And I partnered up with a 
woman who became a really good friend afterwards and it’s because I met her and could study 
with her that I took the exam and got licensed in 75 when I did. And it was all because of an 
organization that I belonged to where they actually encouraged you to do that and backed you up 
and helped you. And so I think that was the first organization in architecture that I was really 
involved in. But when I came back from Mozambique I went to the AIA so I started working 
with women there. But I also joined an association of Black women in architecture which was 
the first time I knew some of the—or got to know some of the Black women who had been 
practicing before me. And so we had something called The Association of Black Women in 
Architecture which lasted for a couple of years. And the woman who started it later died of 
cancer and when she died the organization sort of came apart. But right during that period they 
had the first meeting in Washington, DC at Howard University of Black Women in Architecture 
and that’s when I first met Norma Sklarek and but I met women from all over the country. But it 
was the first time that I met Norma and I met women who came from across the county and it 
was like, so incredible because here are all the people who you’d want and wish you had known 
before who could’ve been your mentors. But none of us had really, I mean only a few of us had 
met before. The New York people, we all knew each other, but there was—and so there was that 
meeting and I think that meeting maybe was in 1984. And then there was a follow-up meeting to
—that at Hampton and then another meeting at Howard. And so I sort of felt like I was getting to 
know women, white women, Black women, women from other places and I had a really 
incredible friend who I’d graduated with at Howard who was from India, Suman Sorg who ended 
up running one of the most successful architecture firms in Washington, DC ever, male female 
whatever, but she ran it as a—it’s her firm—it was her firm. So it was just good to go back to DC 
for those reasons. In New York, I joined the AIA finally and found out yes there is something 
more to it than just the women’s sections and I was on the board of the AIA, right after I joined I 
was on the board for several years and then I joined NYCOBA, which was a local organization 
of Black architects, the New York Coalition of Black Architects and I was one of the early 
women there, maybe the second woman to join that organization. And but whatever I joined I 
always liked—I mean to become an officer or do something is just a matter of how hard are you 
willing to work. Because most people don’t really want to put in that much work on somethings 
that like I say, you don’t get paid for. But I was interested in the profession and I was interested 
in advancing Black folks in the profession so I worked in that organization and then I worked in 
NOMA which was the National Organization of Minority Architects.  
[01:10:00] 
And I first went to a conference they had in Atlanta and but then when I went I was so amazed 
that there were people from all over the country and there were men and women Black folks 
from everywhere who came to those conferences and I joined the organization and basically all I 
did was just go to meetings and just listen in, see what’s going on but one day they asked me if I 
Roberta Washington Interview, July 26, 2020two-ﬁrst
Women Architects, afc2019/031
18
would be interested in being on the board. And I think it was also because I think the main reason 
was because there weren’t any members—there weren’t a lot of members from New York— 
although people, when it was founded, there were several people from New York who were very 
active. But the Black New Yorkers were mostly involved in NYCOBA, the local organization. So 
I did get on the board and several years later I became president but then as president what I 
wanted to do was to get the NYCOBA people in New York to become members of NOMA. And 
the main stumbling block was that the New York Coalition of Black architects didn’t think that 
they should join an organization where you had to drop the word Black. And all of the other—
most of the chapters became like, you know, Illinois National Organization of Minority 
Architects and whatever. But they had “minority” and so it was just this whole discussion of 
whether you’re a minority or you’re Black or whatever. And so the compromise which I had 
suggested was that we keep NYCOBA, New York Coalition of Black Architects and be slash 
NOMA. Right so now we’re both NYCOBA/NOMA, right. And so the New York people agreed 
and so that’s when they became a chapter of the national NOMA organization and we had the 
conference in New York, the year after I was president or something. But I think that the history 
of NOMA was always about looking at how they as an organization could advance the duration 
and the viability of Black architectural firms. That was the main goal. I think that they do lots of 
other things, like they’re interested in students and supporting students and promoting students 
and of helping people grow and advance. But I think that they really wanted in the beginning—it 
was because members who had firms wanted to succeed and figure out how they could do it and 
they saw it being done better as a group than just an individual effort. And I think that’s what got 
them to where they are now. Although I think now there are other discussions about where—
what is the future of the Black architectural firm. You know like there was a time that Black 
architects established their own firms because they had to basically because they—maybe you 
could be lucky enough in the beginning, some of them, to get a job working in a white firm but 
most didn’t get that opportunity and most got training working for other Black architects. But 
then people—they started realizing just like I realized, you know, that maybe my fortune was to 
do something on my own because even if it were on a smaller scale based on what I put in I 
could see what I’m getting out of it. And I think that may have been a reason why there were so 
many Black architectural firms in different periods and that NOMA, I think, did what they could 
or has worked in areas to promote firm longevity. 
[01:15:00] 
But I think that’s still one of the key issues that Black firms face now is can they exist and how 
can they exist. And sometimes things that seem like improvements really make it more difficult 
to exist. So for instance, how many firms—the number of firms that we have now differ from the 
Black firms that existed let’s say twenty-five years ago or thirty years ago. Because in those 
periods Black architects found it very difficult to get any work at a white firm or to get enough 
work to keep you there—that you didn’t really have too many other choices except to start your 
own firm except or associate with other Black architects and start something. But now in this 
particular age I think it’s gone like a complete full circle almost. Because now most, or many of 
the Black architects who would have firms or some who have had firms now find positions in 
Roberta Washington Interview, July 26, 2020two-ﬁrst
Women Architects, afc2019/031
19
large firms that used to be white and now don’t really consider that they’re white. They think that 
they are multiracial now because you’re there so the Black architect is now part of their firm and 
so they can say well, look we have these major people—these Black firms—who had their own 
firms. We have these Black architects, these practitioners who are part of our firm and so now the 
choice for a client is that it’s harder to find Black architects who still have their own firms. 
Because just as I was saying, like I didn’t really start out trying to have a firm. If it had been 
possible to be recognized within somebody else’s firm I would have done that but I think that 
might be possible today. And it may only be possible because also just in terms of who the client 
is and all over the country Black folks and Black communities and Black organizations all have 
become major clients. And if certain kinds of projects are being done they are, if they are city or 
state projects, they usually are somehow or many of them are affected by Black folks who live 
nearby or who have something to do with the projects. So now people want to show that they are 
equal opportunity employers. And they can do that because they can afford to hire Black folks 
who are somewhere else and they can show also that they have no prejudice because they’re on 
their team now. And so there are people who you might have hired when they had their own firm, 
that time has passed, and now they’re working for some of the larger firms. And so the 
competition now is like a—I mean I went to a meeting for a pre-proposal conference and I was 
surprised that there were representatives from large, what I would have thought white firms, who 
sent representatives there, but they sent Black representatives because they work in their firms 
now. And so now—and so then I was feeling like well, gosh, I would have normally expected to 
be competing with other firms but other firms my size. And suddenly big firms can send 
someone to a proposal for what I would have thought is a smaller project but now everything 
could be theirs. It’s like there’s nothing that’s considered a project for a small firm. They 
compete for everything and they have connections everywhere and so it’s no longer about are 
you in the neighborhood or not. Anyway so but that’s how I think that firm culture, the firm 
makeup is changing and it’s changing how people who are clients see them. And then it’s not 
about race or color so much in terms of the selection because those firms have Black folks too. 
So now it’s really more about well, you know, we could get a big firm to do it or  
[01:20:00] 
we could get a small firm to do it because in terms of race now, it’s all neutral now. That’s how it 
seems I think to the clients. Anyway,  so I think that those things have changed but in terms of 
other organizations, I joined the Community Planning Board because I lived in the community 
that was being planned in central Harlem and I wanted to—I first used to present before them. 
And I realized that I really wish I was on the other side to see, understand how they saw it—how 
they see projects and so I was—I got there and I liked it. It was the roughest non-paying job I 
ever, ever had because the folks are tough sometimes. They’re mean, they’re nasty. It was like—
it was crazy and our community board was one of the most feared community boards in the city. 
I mean like, if you had to present before them, like people just would tell you whatever they 
wanted and they threatened to beat you up if you didn’t agree. It was crazy. Some people used to 
be afraid of our community board at various times but I thought I tamed my part, my corner of 
the board as much as I could. And I understood—after I was there for a while I understood where

20
they were coming from. I could represent them better and also I could explain to them why we 
should present ourselves a little differently but it was all really good and people were just so, so, 
so devoted to what they thought would preserve the neighborhood in terms of the good parts. 
And they were just very devoted. That was it. And they just felt like people were taking things 
from them and if there was something really good then they’d take it. And that was what they 
sort of predicted that like in Harlem, they were predicting that if we ever got it to where it was 
really good we’d know because other folks would want to come here. So  
SF: 
The developers would be lining up. 
RW: 
Yes, and they’re right. And so that has happened. So I think that overall that I was in 
organizations that—where I learned a lot. I think I was able to contribute to all of those different 
groups. And it took a lot of time that I could have done something else with, but I think it was 
important to me not as the architect all of the time but sometimes as a person in the community 
or person in the city. And that was the same for the Landmarks Preservation Commission where I 
stayed like probably far longer than I should have because I kept feeling like there were areas of 
the city that I felt were unrepresented and that I thought I could speak to. But in the end I just 
lament that I didn’t fight harder to save some buildings and that I didn’t—there was so much to 
do and I just felt like I didn’t do it all. There were so many buildings that I wish when I think 
about it that I had saved, that I didn’t save or didn’t argue for enough or didn’t fight for hard 
enough. And yet I did speak up in cases where I thought no one else would and sometimes it 
worked and sometimes it didn’t. But I still think that there are some buildings that I was part of 
saving and I think that that’s important. But it was hard. It was hard. And then in the end because 
I was on the board, on the commission, and it was a small firm. I have a small firm and had a 
small firm then too, I wasn’t able legally to do landmarked projects but we were landmarking 
more and more projects and designating more historic districts all the time so then it was really 
getting hard to work because almost everything—I mean we were just designating a whole bunch 
of parts of the city—Brooklyn, and the Bronx and Manhattan. And in one month I got three 
potential clients who called to ask me to do projects but they were all  
[01:25:00] 
in landmarked districts in different—one in Manhattan, one in the Bronx and one in Brooklyn 
and I’m thinking, Oh my gosh, where can—how can I work?  
SF: 
Yes that really restricted you. 
RW: 
It did and I should have left before because—you know I think that they really should be 
paying for that work. It’s a non-paying job but they act like you had to come there, be there every 
day, not every day—once a week. And I just think it was—that was a lot of work and then they 
say you don’t really have to do anything except show up. But that’s not true. You really have to 
study. You have to know what they’re talking about ahead of time. You have to read otherwise

21
you’ll just look really dumb. So it takes time and it takes energy. But I did it and I’m glad I did it 
and it’s over. 
SF: 
Where are you now in your career? 
RW: 
Um, so I still have architectural projects and I suppose I could have others but I do want 
to see if it’s possible to pause for maybe a couple of months or six months or so because I do 
want to do some writing and I was talking about the history of Black architects in New York for 
instance. It’s something I’ve been talking about and started writing years ago. I want to work on 
it but I don’t see—I haven’t quite figured out how I can—how I’m doing it all but I think that at 
least for four or six months or something, I should be able to just sort of not take any new jobs 
and to survive with just what I have, some smaller jobs. And to sort of dedicate my time to 
writing, research and writing.  
SF: 
I read somewhere that you were also researching and writing about Beverly Loraine 
Green and Georgia Louise Harris Brown.  
RW: 
Yes, yes, I actually wrote pieces that are being posted on the Beverly Willis website about 
those two women. So one of the things that happened which again was a coincidence and luck 
and sometimes just life just sort of takes you where it wants you to go, I guess. But when I was 
president of NOMA, I met this historian, Vincent McKenzie, who was a librarian at Auburn 
University and he was the historian for NOMA and he asked when I first became president what 
subject would I like for him to do. And he explained that as the president he would work on 
whatever direction I sent him in and so I said I wanted  him to research Black women in 
architecture. And he said okay and he went away and he came back with like a five page single 
spaced document. And it was like incredible because here are the people who I wish I’d know 
forever, who just reading about—just what little I knew of them and then I started doing 
research. What I knew and then what I learned about them made me wish I’d known these 
women in person because then what he discovered was then Norma Sklarek wasn’t the first 
Black woman licensed in the country but she was actually the third. And then he knew about the 
others, right. So he knew about Beverly Green and he knew about Brown and he knew that they 
were licensed in the forties. And so when he told me about them I just started researching. And I 
don’t know what at the time I thought I was going to do with the information but then later on 
there was a book that was being published about Black architects that was being published about 
Black architects from 1947 or something to nineteen-fifty something. And it was a book—
supposed to be a book of biographies and so I begged  to write those two and I also wanted to 
write Ifill Johnson—about the two founders of the firm  
[01:30:00] 
I was telling you about before Ifill Johnson Hanchard. And I wrote about O’Neill, an architect, a 
Black architect in Chicago. And interesting, his office was the office that the first two Black 
women each worked in, at separate times. And he hired them both. And so, anyway, I did those

Women Architects, afc2019/031
22
five. But I was just fascinated with the lives of the two-first Black women. And I just finished the 
one about the bio of about Beverly Green, the expanded version. So there’s something in the 
book but I finished the piece that will be on the Beverly Willis website of their fifty—I think it 
started out being called—so it’s fifty women who are being called frontier designers or 
something. But it’s fifteen early women in architecture in New York in the country. 
SF: 
Well I hope that you will write your book about the history of Black architects because I 
was able to see the lecture that you presented on that topic and it would be so wonderful to have 
all that information available in a book. I think it would be great. Your lecture was wonderful but 
it would be great for it to be in every library so that people all over the country are exposed.  
RW: 
Good, I think so. 
SF: 
What do you think is your greatest accomplishment? 
RW: 
I think surviving it all and living to tell about it. No, like in the period of coronavirus 
where so many people were dying and I knew people who were dying. It sort of just made me 
think life is short and you shouldn’t put off too long the things that you think you have to do. So 
I think my greatest accomplishment would be to actually do those things that I’ve been saying I 
was going to do for a while. And I guess beyond that or before that I would say my greatest 
accomplishment is finishing architecture school, getting licensed, having worked in Mozambique 
and where I really learned a lot about being an architect because I didn’t have anyone else to ask 
or anyone to talk to and so I learned from contractors pretty much. My first fieldwork was in the 
field with Portuguese speaking contractors right, because I’d never been out in the field in New 
York before I went there. But I think and just in terms of accomplishment it’s just somehow 
finishing what I started. And that’s what I sort of tell people now who are looking for advice 
about what to do and I’m saying just finish, you know. It’s like if you started out in school 
because you wanted to become an architect, then get licensed. If you decided that you wanted to 
design some particular in some particular area whether it’s housing or education. If you know 
there’s something that you want to do, then do it. That should be the biggest accomplishment of 
anyone is actually doing something that you started out to do because that’s not easy. 
SF: 
Well, what about your legacy. What do you see as your legacy? 
RW: 
Well I think, let’s see, what would be my legacy. I suppose that I’m interested in history 
and the history of things of organizations of companies, of people of projects. And that I would 
hope that my legacy is that I wouldn’t let regular folks who say that we just want to do 
architecture—I wouldn’t let them forget that we’re here as a result of some history and that it’s 
possible that knowing or understanding that history can make our lives move faster and that just 
as we need to know what’s gone before, we should also pay attention to documenting  
[01:35:00] 
Roberta Washington Interview, July 26, 2020two-ﬁrst
Women Architects, afc2019/031
23
what we’re doing because you never know, but to some people we might be that inspiration that 
they need. 
SF: 
Yes, I’m sure you have been. If you could change the profession what would you change? 
RW: 
You mean if I could change it now, from right now?  
SF: 
Yes, knowing what you know. 
RW: 
Okay so first of all I think the profession has been changed although we don’t maybe 
recognize it right now. I think that the corona virus period, the covid 19, changed our profession 
while we weren’t watching, right? First of all it changed how we designed, right? It’s not just 
elevators that the number of people have been reduced on but everything about everything we 
design is changed. Now that we know what’s possible, I don’t think we can ever go back to the 
very overcrowded—for instance I’m working—the project that—one of the projects I’m working 
on now, I’m finishing up, was/is an office project for a not-for-profit and all of our seating and all 
of our desks are pre-covid 19, right? None of that works. None of that works now. I mean I told 
them—they don’t want to listen just yet because they can’t believe it—that we really have to re-
think the entire design because I don’t see anybody ever wanting to sit that close to their co-
workers ever again. So I think about design. I saw something today about how toilets in 
bathrooms have to change. How schools have to change. How can you—how do you study 
together apart? How can you have lunch together in the cafeteria? Yeah, we can say when there’s 
a vaccination it will all be over but maybe, maybe not, I just don’t know. So I’m thinking that we 
have to think about what we know from the immediate past as being part of our future for yet 
another few years. And in addition to that I think that the last few months of lockdown has taught 
us as architects that we don’t all have to be in the office together at the same time and that it is 
possible to create and to work and to produce architecture from different places. Although I mean 
I really miss being in the office because it would be so much easier for me to just tell three 
drafters at one time what it is I want to do and to go on from there. But I know that it’s possible 
to do it from my house because I’m doing it from my house. And I had to do it and I’m doing it. 
And I know of other architects who are working that way. So I think that it might be that for 
small and medium sized firms, that not everyone works in the office again, ever. And so it’s a 
whole different way of looking at work and it’s a whole different way of working that I think has 
been changed at least in the short period and probably in the long period by what we all went 
through. 
SF: 
Are there any other stories or projects that you would like to include about favorite 
projects or challenges that you’ve had? 
RW: 
Let’s see. I’ve had lots of challenges but I’m not thinking of any I really want to be 
talking about. Oh, I could say the earliest one, some early things. I think when I first started, my 
first project as an architect working on a health facility project by myself, in my own firm, was a 
project that I had at Downstate Medical Center. And I went to the meeting and it was a state 
Roberta Washington Interview, July 26, 2020two-ﬁrst
Women Architects, afc2019/031
24
project and I got it because I showed—I had to show background and all of those things but I got 
this project and I went to the site on the first day with the project manager. And so I’m sitting in a 
room where there are no women except me and  there are no Black folks except me and there’re 
a bunch of very stern faced doctors and some other lab people. And so the project was a dialysis 
center for Downstate and a laboratory and I’ve forgotten the third component. And so this is like 
before the meeting is starting, we’re still waiting for people to come in and so the guy who is the 
project manager who represents the state organization that’s paying for the project is sitting there 
with me. And so someone in the back raises their hand and says and he is talking to the guy who 
is there. And he has introduced himself and he’s introduced me as the architect. And so someone 
says, “Now, um, you mean Ms. Washington, uh, works for the architect, right?” And he says, 
“No, she’s the architect.” And he says, “Well you know, you mean she is, she has a firm? She’s 
not working for the architect. She is the architect?” And he says, “Yes, that’s right, she is the 
architect and it is her firm.” And then someone else say, “Well you know to work on these jobs 
you have to have a certain kind of experience. So this isn’t just—you can’t just do some housing 
project and think you can come in and do a hospital or health facility project.” And the guy says, 
“Well we’ve checked her out and she has that experience”. And then someone else says, “But 
you know that this is really a very special hospital and this project is a very special project so 
you know, it can’t just be anybody who can handle it.” And he’s saying to them, like no one 
acknowledged I was there. 
SF: 
With you sitting there. 
RW: 
And they’re sitting there and talking to each other. 
SF: 
As if you’re not there. 
RW: 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so he starts the meeting and so I talk and I tell them what it is that 
I would need from them and I’m saying we’re going to have meetings and I wanted to see what 
the current facility is and then we can talk about the future and then we’ll have programming so 
I’m explaining everything and people are just looking and staring at me. And uh but, I was 
thinking when I think back about the thing—I think they were surprised later on that I did not 
seem angry after what happened, happened you know, because they didn’t even realize that 
anything happened until later on. It didn’t strike them that that was odd that they were talking 
about me in front of me. But the thing is that I couldn’t act as if it mattered so even though I 
heard what they were saying and I understood the implications of what they were saying—when 
I spoke to them it was as if I either hadn’t heard it, I wasn’t there or it didn’t matter. And I think 
the importance of that is that I somehow had just already decided that nothing that folks could 
say in that vein would bother me right because if I knew who I was and I knew that I could do 
what I could do, there’s no reason to get angry, there’s no reason—but there’s also no reason to 
act as if you are taking offense because you have to assume that they just don’t know. And as it 
happened, some of those people who said things became my supporters at the end. And we did 
work together and by the time we had finished working together I don’t think they would have 
said that to anyone else, ever, because I think that sometimes you have to understand that people 
Roberta Washington Interview, July 26, 2020two-ﬁrst
Women Architects, afc2019/031
25
have a certain blind spot or ignorance about things that they haven’t seen in their lifetime. And it 
doesn’t help if you have an attitude. So I learned to lose the attitude and just go with the flow and 
understand that where they were coming from 
[01:45:00] 
is the only place they knew to come from but if to work with them I have to like just sort of 
overlook somethings that in another life I probably would not have wanted to overlook.  
SF: 
What a powerful opportunity to educate them. As you said they ultimately became your 
biggest supporters.  
RW: 
Yes, yes, but I think that that’s partially—and sometime I feel that in those situations, I 
did not know if it was because I was female or if it was because I was Black. You know, like 
sometimes I felt—sometimes it was discrimination but sometimes I think it was just pure 
ignorance in not having had—this was like the first opportunity when they could have had to 
work with someone who wasn’t what they were thinking it should be  And I think that women 
who work in all kinds of other fields have the same kinds of encounters and Black folks have 
those same encounters. I just happen to belong to two groups that run into those encounters. So it 
means I really can’t have too much attitude and still do what I want to do. 
SF: 
Well, you’ve accomplished great things so really it’s been such a pleasure talk to you. Is 
there anything else you’d like to add? You’ve been very generous with your time and I don’t 
want to keep you. But’s it been such a pleasure to talk with you and hear your story. 
RW: 
I’m sure there are other things that, if I could think. But I think what I’ve said  is 
probably representative of the things that happened. 
SF: 
Okay, yes well I hope we have an opportunity to meet down the road.  
RW: 
I do too. 
SF: 
Well, thank you very much. 
RW: 
Okay, you’re very welcome. It’s been a pleasure.
