KS: Okay, so this is Kim Stryker, and I'm sitting here with Amanda Stewart, and we're at 
the Virginia Vineyards Association meeting in Charlottesville, Virginia on February 24, 
2018. A Saturday at about 1:36. 
Amanda, Tell me a little bit... You are an assistant professor of Food Science and 
Technology at Virginia Tech. So what does that mean? 
[00:00:35] 
AS: I work at the university, which Virginia Tech is a land grant university. So our 
mission, the Land Grant mission, is to support agriculture and a development of 
agriculture in the state of Virginia. So we do that through a combination of teaching 
research and extension work. I work primarily with research and teaching. So I work with 
students, graduate students and food science and technology, and my students focus their 
research on fermentation and enology, the science of fermented foods and beverages. And 
we specialize in wine and cider as well. 
KS: Alright, OK OK [pause] Wine and cider. So I know there's some cider people 
participate in some of the different trade organizations throughout the state. I know Diane 
Flynt from Foggy Ridge has been a really big influential person, but wine is the big show 
in the state of Virginia, wouldn't you say? 
AS: Certainly. 
[00:01:37] 
KS: And so your position, is that something that already existed before you came on or 
was this a newer position?

AS: Yeah... It's sort of a new iteration of a position that's been around for a while. So Dr. 
Bruce Zoecklin was in a position like this, before I was. And when he came here, I think 
it was in the 1980s, I think there were some 20 or 30 wineries in the state, and so he 
worked closely with them and was really instrumental in the development of educational 
resources and training and technical resources for the Virginia wine industry's 
development. If you haven't talked to him yet, you should... 
KS: Yeah, we did actually, we talked to him earlier this morning. 
AS: Okay, so Bob did a lot to develop this position and paved the way for the program. 
And he, since his retirement, the industry had grown so much that he had the job doing 
the teaching research AND extension. And so they decided to hire two people to kind of 
carry on with that. So I'm the research and teaching and I have a little broader focus in 
other fermented beverages as well as wine. But then we have another position that 
focuses 100% on the extension. And we have lot more students now, and really have had 
a lot of growth in fermented food and beverages in the department. But on wine 
specifically now we have two people instead of just one, so... 
[00:03:09] 
KS: Right. So what are some other fermented food and beverages that we might 
encounter, like uh sauerkraut? 
AS: Sure, sure. I mean, sauerkraut is one. There are a LOT of fermented foods and 
beverages out there right now, and those are some things that our students are very 
interested in. We have a ferment... , it's called the fermentation option for students in the 
food science department. So through that program, we study things like, of course, beer, 
wine, cider, distilled spirits, your brewing is really big in Virginia too... So we do those 
things. And then on the food side of fermented foods include yogurt, cheese, 
sauerkraut's... definitely one. Cocoa. Cocoa starts out, the beans are fermented in the field 
before it's made into cocoa butter and chocolate. 
KS: Oh! I did not know that! 
[00:03:57] 
AS: So there are all kinds of products out there where fermentation is part of the process. 
And so we try to leverage some of the strength that we've developed around wine, and 
that's come up over the past decades at Virginia Tech, to kind of expand the program to 
the service and help the development of the other industries as well. 
KS: Great, so as you said, it's been a huge explosion in Virginia. I think it 280 now 
independent wineries and/or vineyards? How did you come... Are you from Virginia 
originally or... 
[00:04:35] 
Winery Workers in Virginia

AS: No. I came here by a long and winding road. I'm from Indiana originally, and I 
studied at Purdue, and I actually worked in the enology lab working with the wine 
industry there when I was an undergraduate student. And you really… don't think of wine 
off the top of your head when you think of Indiana, but some of the first wineries in this 
country were in the Ohio River valley. It was inspiring to me to see what the university 
could do to provide educational resources and train people to work in those industries and 
help to bring up the level of quality and the standard of knowledge by producers. And so I 
really was inspired by that work, but then I started working in different industry –in 
recycling- and ended up living in Oregon, and then found a lot of good opportunities to 
work with wine there. And so I got back into wine and was making wine there, and then 
went to grad school and then got this job. And I had never been to Blacksburg before I 
went for the interview, but I absolutely loved it. And it's such an exciting industry in... I 
mean, coming to Virginia and seeing what was going on with the industry here was just 
tremendously exciting. This is probably... Especially for red wines, I'd say, this is the 
premier region in the eastern United States. So it was an amazing opportunity to be part 
of that. And so I jumped at that. 
[00:06:09] 
KS: What's funny, a lot of people who get into wine making in Virginia, who I've 
interviewed already, talk about it being a Wild West of the East, there's so much to figure 
out. So there's so much that you can try and innovate and experiment with, and that's part 
of the appeal, I think, for a lot of people. 
AS: Sure. Yeah, I... For me too... I like to work with emerging regions and it's exciting to 
be in one that is definitely is still... There are a lot of things still to figure out and try… a 
lot of new and exciting potentials for different varieties or sites and everything, but 
they've got so much traction already and already an established track record of success 
and making some great wines. I think it's a really good time to be part of the industry. 
KS: Does your program at all talk about the interaction between tourism and agriculture 
and how that has... Because that's really the model, I think, that's so different about 
Virginia, how much the tourism aspect that is emphasized at a lot of the wineries... 
AS: Sure. Sure. And that really is beyond the scope of what we do, we're more in the lab, 
we do chemistry, microbiology processing technology stuff. That's beyond scope that I'm 
doing with my students. But I am working to partner with some people who incorporate 
more of the social science approaches and try to understand how maybe, not as much of 
the tourism specifically, but just knowledge of the production process and the producers 
and the impact on the local economy, how those kind of things can influence a customer's 
decision to buy a product. Beyond just the way that it tastes -that's determined by its 
chemistry. There's a lot more to it. So we're trying to partner with people who can assess 
those things too. 
[00:08:03]

KS: Yeah, that's interesting to look into... 'cause I think especially in the Northern 
Virginia area, where we are, where there's such a density, people definitely have their 
favorite winery. And they go to THEIR favorite winery. And whether that's because of the 
wine or not... Seems to be a little bit beside the point. It's just like they love the view or 
they love the people, they love the music or whatever IT is. So it's a very interesting part 
that I don't think anybody's really looked at it. 
AS: Yeah, it's not... That would be cool. Yeah. 
KS: To explore. And so, are you seeing a lot more students coming, especially from 
Virginia into Virginia Tech? Who are interested in pursuing careers in wine? 
AS: Ah yeah... Definitely. We've got SO many students interested in this now, and I teach 
a class, it's called "Wines and Vines", and it's a Horticulture and Food Science class, but 
it's open to anybody on campus. So I have students in my class from Business, 
Marketing, from Engineering. And also we have a lot of students from Food Science and 
Horticulture, of course. But every semester I have at least one student who didn't know 
anything about wine, came to the class, took it as an elective in Agriculture, and ends up 
doing a winery internship or goes on to work in a winery. 
[00:09:19] 
Yeah, it's really cool to see how just giving the… arming the students with little bit of 
knowledge and some resources can really change their career paths and get them turned 
on to the wine industry. And we have students, definitely from Virginia, who come, we 
have the fermentation option. And in the Hort. Department, we have a Viticulture minor 
now. So we have students joining those programs, who know they wanna be focused on 
those products. 
But we have students, yeah, from ALL over campus who come and take our courses in 
wine and brewing. They get to apply their science backgrounds or their business 
backgrounds to kind of a new area. 
And one of the interesting things that I've seen lately is that students -for the graduate 
program - coming from OTHER places. I recently had a student... she's... her hometown 
is in Northern California. And she graduated from Berkeley and then she came HERE to 
do a Master's degree. 
KS: Wow. 
[00:10:18] 
AS: Because she wanted to see something different. She wanted to see new and exciting 
wine regions and how you work with new regions. So that was pretty exciting to see that 
kind of path starting to happen. And we see more students applying from New York, 
Texas, Florida, not just Virginia. 
Winery Workers in Virginia

KS: Right, where they actually New York and Texas, are both big wine producers. 
AS: Yeah, yeah! 
KS: But they wanna see sort of like maybe… the cross referencing of what do they do 
here versus what would they do at home.. I. Think so yeah, that's great. That's all great for 
the science, for the industry for everything. So where do you see the future of Virginia 
wine going? 
AS: Oh wow, the future of Virginia wine, I think that our producers will continue to gain 
a national and international recognition. I think a lot of excellent products out there 
already. I think as we progress through finding what varieties work best in what sites and 
everything that will just continue to succeed and gain notoriety. And I think it also as a 
younger generation, like millennials are drinking wine so much more often and really 
becoming wine consumers that that will help just build the base of the industry to, 
KS: What do you think is behind why millennials -or whatever we wanna call this 
generation coming up – I know they don’t like to be called millenials, but..., but what do 
you think is behind all of this interest and passion for wine and trying out all these 
different things? The processes behind everything, fermentation, that sort of thing...? 
[00:12:07] 
AS: Wow. I don't know. I think they have a real, sincere interest in learning the real story 
behind things and finding things that are REAL… and learning about. Yeah. Like you 
mentioned, learning about the process seems to be of more interest to the general 
population in that age group, I think than maybe prior generations cared more about the 
cultural aspects are the name brand kind of thing. But no, I think they care more about 
how the fruit was grown, where it comes from, and then how that impacts the economy 
and social justice. They care about a lot of things that we didn't talk about as much in the 
food industry 10, 20 years ago. 
[00:13:00] 
KS: So it's reflective of the larger changes in the food system overall. 
AS: Yeah. 
KS: And wine is just sort of like, well, I can see it's quite accessible as well. It's fun and 
people wanna go do it and it's in beautiful places, but also you can literally go to the place 
–like you can’t go to the wheat farm that your bread comes from, but you can go to see 
where the grapes grow and meet the people who make them the in to wine. Then 
people like that behind the scenes kind of feeling. 
[00:13:38] 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
AS: Yeah they get to feel like they can actually learn something about the producers and 
the people who are involved and bringing the product to the table builds community to 
wine, sharing it with your friends, having it as part of cooking and family meals. That's a 
really encouraging trend to see. 
KS: Was it part of your life growing up? 
AS: (laughing) No, no. No, not at all... 
KS: Really? 
AS: No, no. Nope. 
KS: When did you start getting into wine? 
[00:14:10] 
AS: Yeah, I was one of those engineering students who took a wine class and it just 
kinda changed the whole course my of life. I took the class as a junior, I started working 
in the lab and I really like this. 
KS: Those wine classes! Yeah, they're a gateway to... 
AS: Yeah! (laughing) 
KS: Yeah... Yeah, just take you down that bad… Alright. Well, thank you so much for 
your time. 
AS: Thank you. I’m happy to contribute.
