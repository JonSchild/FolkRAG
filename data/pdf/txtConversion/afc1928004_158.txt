SAYS I MUSTN'T .

I 
fell ia love with a 
pretty girl, 
A few short yearn ago. 
All sorts of weather. hail or rain, 
To court her I 
would go; 
I'd long and sigh with love until 
"Pwas time to be away, 
And when I 
asked a 
parting kiss, 
She always used to say : 
CI101:US. 
Oh, mother says I 
mustn't, mother says I 
mustn't ! 
Oh, George. please. George, not just yet awhile ; 
Mother says I 
muetn't, mother says I 
mustn't ! 
oh, George, don't, George, not just yet. 
1 waiting" kept, st last, one day, 
thought I'd know my fate, 
I 
sunk upon my knees in quite 
An agonizing state; 
" 
Selina, say you'll have your George, 
And when shall w 
o 
be wed?" 
I 
longed to hear my love's reply, 
And this is what she said— 
Spoken—Well, George, dear, you're very kind, but we oould 71*Vtr 
live 
,
ii 
two hillitlyed * year, so until 3 
ou are worth at least five 
hundred per annum, darling— 
Mother says I 
mustn't, & c. 
From then I 
went to work, by Jove ! 
I 
left no atone unturned, 
-Until five handrail pounds n 
year. 
At last I 
really earne d. ; 
Selina heard how things had elian..ed, 
And when we met ose day, 
Shit seemed so pleasant, and at last 
She lovingly did say— 
Spoken—You remember, George, dear, what I 
said when you asked 
me some time ago.— well, George, 
oar, an you have so improved ill 
circumstances, suppose you ask me now, Georgy. Porgey, darling ? 
eh, what sav ? 
Well, said I, upon consideration you're very kind, but— 
Mother says I 
mustn't, & c. 
Give me the girl who Invite a 
man, 
And loess him for himself, 
Whose first consid•ratiot is, not 
What te's worth in pelf: 
All sordid-minded damsels, who 
May worship golden dress. 
May they be old maida till they die, 
And we'll nisesir fool their leas— 
Spoken— So ladies who don't want to bo old reside, mind you, don't 
sn,5e too often say— 
Mother says I 
mustn't, &c.

ON BOAIID 
THE KANGAROO. 
Ant : —" Irish Molly, 0." 
Once I 
was a 
waterman, and liv'd at home at ease, 
Now I 
am a 
mariner and plough the angry seas; 
I 
thought I'd like seafarin' life: so bid my love adoo! 
And shipp'd as cook and steward boy, on board o' the Kangaroo. 
I 
never thought she would be false or ever prove untrue, 
*When we sail'd away, from New York Bay, on board o' the Kanrfaroo. 
My love she wan no foolish girl, her age it was two score, 
My love she was B o 
spinster, she was married twice befor • : 
And they could not say it was her wealth that stole my heart away. 
She was starcher at a 
laundress' for thirty cents a 
day. 
I 
never thought, & c. 
0! think of me, oh! think of me! she mournfully did say, 
When you are in a 
furrin land, carorsin' far away, 
And take this lucky three cent bit, ' twill make you bear in mind, 
The loving, faithful, trusting heart you'll leave in tears behind. 
I 
never thought, & c. 
Cheer up, cheer up, my own true love, don't weep so bitterly, 
But she sobb'd, and sighid, and choled, and cried and couldn'nt say 
Good-bye ! 
I 
shan't be gone so very long, only months a 
few, 
And when I 
doee come back again, in course, I'll marry yon. 
I 
never thought, & c. 
Our vessel it was homeward bound from many a 
furrin shore, 
And many a 
furrin present unto my love I 
bore; 
There were tortoises from Tennerifle, and toys from Timbuctol, 
"
L:\A. Chinese rat, and a 
Bengal cat, and a 
Bombay Cockatoo. 
I 
never thotiOlt, & e. 
Paid off, I 
sought her dwellin' in the subbubs of the town, 
A hancient dame upon a 
line was hanging out a 
gown : 
Where is my I.•-ve I 
She's married sir, about si1111011thS ago, 
Toa smart young man what drives a 
cart for S. T. Sir NV;; I 
& Co, 
I 
never though t, 
Farewell to dreams of married life ! to soap. to suds and Hue. 
To Glenfield starch, and Harper Twelve- trees' washing poi\ der, too! 
I'll seek some far and distant clime, I 
can no longer stay, 
And on some Chinese Hottin,gtot I'll throw myself away ! 
I 
never thought, &c.

L ITTLE NELLY B A Y. 
As snug by JAYss Mc CALI, the English Comic. 
I love a 
little country queen, a 
village beauty rare, 
With rosy cheeks and pearly teeth, and lovely nut-brown 
hair; 
Her waist it is so slender, and her feet they are so small, 
Of all the girls I 
ever loved my Kelly beats theta all. 
CHORUS . 
Nelly Ray, Ne:ly Ray, charming little 
iNelly Ray, Nelly Ray, pretty little belle ; 
Kelly Ray like birds of May, singing all the day, 
I 
never had a 
sweetheart like my charming Kelly Ray. 
Her father keeps a 
farm house, in a 
village down in Kent, 
And being on my holidays, to spend them there I 
went ; 
And while a 
strolling through the fields-, 
as on my way.L. 
roamed. 
its there I 
met my Kelly, as she drove the cattle home. 
Nei.y Ray, &e. 
I 
took my Kelly for a 
walk, among the bright green grass, 
And words of love I 
whispered to this young country hiss ; 
placed my arms around her waist, as I 
sat by her side, 
And while we were a 
talking she pledged to be my bride. 
Kelly Ray, & c. 
An3 now we'ved named the happy day, and how happy 
we shall be, 
No thoughts of jealousy shall enter the minds of her or 
me; 
But in our farm-house we'll be happy, night and day, 
And our lives shall pass like sunshine, for I 
have the 
brightest ray. 
Kelly Ray, & c. 
NUT OF COURSE ITS NO BUSINESS OF MIMIC. 
Words by GEORGE COOPER. 
Some people say I 
am curious, 
For they know that I 
never refuse, 
No matter from whunce I 
oh thin it, 
In getting thw latest of news. 
I 
certainly own that I 
do so, 
And no harm there is I 
opine; 
But whatever I 
hear I 
keep close, 
For of course it's no business of mine. 
Now, I 
see lots of chaps on Broadway. 
Who are dressed in very best style, 
With a 
diamond pin stuck in their bosoms, 
With kids and the shiniest tile. 
They measure out tape in some shop, 
And their salaries ain't very fine; 
Now l'd like to know how it is done, - 
But of course it's no business of mine. 
Now, there's Jones, he's a 
temperance man, 
And he never will go near a 
bar, 
But his nose is as red as a 
berry, 
It shines like a 
lighthouse afar. 
He always drinks milk on a 
Sunday, 
And he says that it's wholesome and fine; 
He's a 
friend of the late Deacon Smythe, 
But of course it's no business of mine. 
Now, I 
know lots of married men, too, 
That are steady and sober at home; 
When they're out of the sight of their spouses, 
From paths which are narrow they roam. 
They drive about town in their conches, 
And you oft see them kick up a 
shine; 
To the " Personals" daily they're writing, 
But of course it's no business of mine. 
DON'T YOU CRY SO NORAH, DARLING. 
NEW YORK SOCIETY. 
Ant—" Don't be Angry with Me, Darling." 
Don't you cry so, Norah, darling, 
Wipe those tears away, 
Don't you cry so, Norah, darling, 
Smile on me to-day ; 
See the wind is freshly blowing, 
And the ship longs for the sea, 
Be to-day your smiles bestowing 
Sweetly, love, on me. 
CHORUS. 
Don't you cry so, Norah, darling, 
Wipe those tears away ; 
Don't you cry so, Norah, darling, 
Smile on me to- day. 
Though ' tis sad to leave you, darling, 
I 
must no more stay, 
Think of me, Norina, darling, 
When I'm far away : 
And, although to part brings sadness, 
Keep your young heart light and free, 
Your sweet face adorn with gladness 
Thinking still of me. 
Don't you cry so, &c. 
limit you cry so, Norah, darling, 
Wipe those tears away, 
Don't you cry so, Norah, darling, 
Smile on me to-day; 
When from work I 
rest a- weary, 
All my thoughts on you will be, 
And my life will not seem dreary, 
If you're true to me. 
Don't you cry so, &c. 
Ant :—" London Society." 
Revised and Sung by GEORGP, lams. 
I 
think I've traveled everywhere, and seen what's to be 
Wherever I 
may roam I 
make myself at home, 
I've flirted down to Long Branch,to Newport I 
have been, 
To Saratoga, Rockaway, and to Rome; 
I'ze, seen society in every shape and form, 
I've watched the tide of fashion rise and fall ; 
I've viewed it in its calm, I've seen it in its storm, 
And this is my conclusion after all, 
CHORUS. 
Baden Baden Spa, France and Germany, 
Liverpool or London, Spain or Italy; 
In such society there's much variety, 
But nothing equals New York society. 
Society as soon as the New York season's o'er, 
Will to the sea run down, where in a 
bathing gown, 
It dabbles in the water or perhaps upon the shore, 
It yawns and wishes it was back in town. 
And though it may be nice to drink the nasty waters, 
And lose your money gambling at the Spa, 
And meet the sort of men you'd cut at any place, 
The New York season I 
prefer by tar. 
Baden Baden Spa, &c. 
Society I've met with in old Ireland, mid the bogs, 
In Paris, ever gay, in London every day, 
In Mount St. Bernard convent, with the monks and jolly 
dogs, 
At every place I 
think that I 
may say. 
But there's a 
charm in town, I 
can't help 6hying 
Which makes me like it more than all the rest, 
To the opera we go. and that will plainly show, 
Society in New York is the best. 
Baden Baden Spa, &c.

CRIME. 
As sung with great applause by Gus W ILLIA.Es. 
Music published by W HIT & GOULLAUD, Boston, Mass. 
I've been thinking of late, I've been thinking, 
Ify thoughts I 
can scarcely dptine. 
I've been thinking why people can wonder, 
At this terrible increase of crime; 
Cries, Old Uncle Sam, it's a " poser," 
There's a 
something I 
can't understand, 
I 
would just give a 
trifle to know, sir, 
Why crime should increase in our land. 
I'm sure that we've plenty of gold, sir, 
Our banks are as full as can hold, sir. 
We could buy the whole world I 
am told, sir, 
Yet still, there's an increase of crime. 
It's true what you say, Uncle Samuel, 
We've plenty of gold laid away, 
Mouldy with mildew and rust, sir, 
Guarded by night and by day ; 
While you, like a 
dog in the manger, 
Your gold to yourself you confine, 
When a 
little would make a 
great change, sir, 
in this terrible increase of crime. 
For expenses you don't. care a 
groat, sir, 
Politicians, you feel a 
whole lot, sir, 
While the poor man, with hunger may rot, sir, 
And still you wonder at crime. 
02,IIILE.—[CONCLIMSD. 
Can you wonder at crime, can you wonder, 
When you see the police on his beat, 
Arresting a 
poor starving man, sir, 
For begging his bread on the street; 
While the thief on the corner stands grinning, 
• In the broad open light of the day, 
Your pockets he'd pick for a 
shilling, 
And the law cannot touch him they say. 
He smiles with contempt and derision, 
lie defies a 
whole police division, 
While the poor man is sent off to prison, 
And still, you wonder at crime. 
Just think while you're drinking your wine, sir, 
How the poor of our land they are fed, 
While you, with your rich folks can dine, sir, 
'Tis a 
god send for them to get bread; 
Go visit the home of the poor, sir, 
Such sights you will never behold, 
To our prisons then go and explore, sir, 
And scatter your hoardings of gold. 
A 
little would soon break assunder, 
Vie chains the poor sufferer is under, 
Gio, list to that great voice of hunger, 
And you'll never more wonder at crime.

NEVER, BOYS, GIVE WAY 
TO SORROW. 
eang with great suesesa in 
TIIE TICKET or-Leivn Vbs. 
[lough to- day be dark and dreary 
And black clouds around us rise, 
Let us halt not nor be weary, 
Light is blooming in the skies! 
Aid and cheer each fellow creature 
'Gainst the storms that round us lour, 
soon they'll wear a 
brighter feature, 
And the sunshine come with power. 
CTIONGO. 
Never, boys, give way to sorrow, 
But be up and act like men; 
Look with hope for joy to- morrow, 
Sunny days will come again. 
•••••, 
Let us throw aside all sadness, 
Better times are on the wing, 
Who can tell what joy and gladness, 
Providence to us may bring ? 
Nerve, then, every manly feeling, 
And with courage meet the storm; 
Let us wounded hearts be healing, 
our duty still perform. 
Never, boys ke. 
We should not be always sighing, 
Norindulge in wild dismay ; 
Be,ar in mind Old Time is flying. 
Therefore wisdom more display. 
I` our prospects be not shining, 
And our hearts be bowed with care, 
Where's the good in our repining ? 
still look up and ne'er despair. 
Never boys, &c. 
BITTER, LATE THAN NEVER. 
What telly ' tis for man to fret and waste his days repining, 
I 
care not though the nue is set, he still is soziewhere shining; 
The clouds that hover round him now will not be there forgiver 
The icy chains which winter links, the spring-tine run will 
sever.

Why, then, why, why not use the strong endeavor— 
Try, men, try, ' tis better late than never. 
Should fortune fly, yet still proceed, ail thowghts of danger 
scorning, 
The lane is long and gtraight, indeed, that has not got a 
turning ; 
'Tis not the wish that makes men great, 'tie works proclaim 
them clever, 
A battle won, though long begun, is better late than never. 
Why, then. &c. 
Then onward be the watchward, still each man on himself re-
lying— 
The way comes frienay with the will, there is nothing lost 
by trying; 
So if success we can't command, to gain it let's endeavor, 
For great or small, if it comes at all, ' tie better late than never. 
Why, then, 
WHAT CAN THE MATTER 
At sixteen years old you could get little good of me,

Och! gramachree! what can the matter be! 
Bothered from head to the tail 
I 
went to confess to Father O'Flannigan— 
Told him my case--made an end—then began again. 
Father, says I, make me soon my own man again, 
If you can find out what I

Oh ! dear, dear, says he, esc. 
Soon I 
fell sick—I 
did bellow and curse again— 
Norah took pity to see me at nurse again; 
Gave me a 
kiss, but och that made me worse again, 
Well she knew what I 
did ail. 
But dear, dear, says slie, 
'Tis long ace), now, since I

How strair—, growing older, our nature should vary! 
All symptoms are gone of my ancient quandary, 
Yet I

PADDY CA.REY. 
'Tens at the town of nate Clogheen, 
That Sergeant Snapp met Paddy Carey; 
A 
claner boy was never seen. 
Brisk as a 
bee, light as a 
fairy; 
His brawny shoulders, four feet square, 
His Aseks like thumping red potatoes, 
His legs would make a 
chairman stare! 
And Pat was loved by all the ladies, 
Old and young, grave and sad, 
Deaf and dumb, dull or mad, 
Waddling, twaddlng, limping, squinting, 
Light, brisk and airy— 
CHORUS. 
All the swaet faces at Limerick races, 
From Nu'linavelt to Magherafelt, 
At Paddy's beautiful name would melt! 
The sowls would cry, and look so shy, 
Och! Cushlamachree, did you never see 
The jolly boy, the darling joy, the ladies toy, 
Nimble-footed, black-eyed, rosy-checked, 
Curly-headed Paddy Carey! 
0, sweet Paddy, beautiful Paddy! 
Nate little, tight little Paddy Carey. 
His heart was made of Irish oak, 
Yet, soft as streams from sweet Killarney, 
His tongue was tipped with a 
bit of the brogue, 
But the deuce a 
bit at all of the blarney. 
Now Sergeant Snapp, so sly and keen; 
While Pat was coaxing duck-lognpd Mary, 
A 
shilling slipped, so nate and claire, 
By the powers, he 'listed Paddy Carey I 
Tight and sound--otrong and light— 
Cheek so round—eyes so bright— 
Whistling, humming, drinking, drummino 
Light, tight and airy— 
All the sweet faces, &c,.

PADDY CAILEY —[coNcLopro.1 
Tho *owls wept loud, the crowd was groat, 
When waddling forth came widow Leary; 
Though she was crippled in her gait, 
Her brawny arms clasped Paddy Carey ! 
" 
Och ! Pat," she cried, " go buy the ring; 
Here's cash, galore, my darling honey." 
Says Pat, " You sowl I'll do that thing." 
And clapped his thumb upon her money. 
Gimlet eye—sausage nose— 
Pat so sly—ogle throws— 
Learing, tittering, jeering, frittering, 
Sweet widow Leary! 
All the sweet faces, ets. 
• 
When Pat had thus his fortune made, 
He pressed the lips of Mistress Leery, 
And mounting straight a 
large cockade, 
In captain's boots struts Paddy Carey; 
He grateful praised her shape, her back, 
To others like a 
dromedary; 
Her eyes, that seemed their strings to crack, 
Were Cupid's darts to Captain Carey! 
Nate and sweet, no alloy— 
All complete—love and joy.

Dear Widow Leary!

hand would seek, 
Think 
be - fore you 
speak, boys. 
When a 
maiden's hand is sought, 
And she's asked if she will wed, 
Oft without a 
second thought 
Is the answer quickly said; 
Be it yea, or be it nay, 
Ere a 
year or two has passed, 
Often does she rue the day 
That her tongue ran on so fast. 
CHO. 
From a 
rash and hasty speech 
Quarrels often will arise, 
Weigh your words then, I 
beseech, 
If a 
quiet life you prize ; 
Then when you those words recall, 
And you've put them to the test, 
You will own that after all 
Second thoughts are always best. 
CHO. 
Thoughtless men will talk until 
They forget what they have said, 
Do they know " the tongue that's still 
Often shows the wisest head?" 
Time and words they only waste, 
With their tongues' unceasing flow, 
Those who always speak in haste 
Very seldom wisdom show.

THME314 OLD CLOTIES WERE NEW 
BOURBON ON THE BRAIN. 
As sung ky W. F. S. LIvrt.ol. 
Eight years ago, I 
looked a 
swell, sirs, 
With walking cane, uud purse as long, 
I 
quizzed the ladies in the atreet, sirs, 
Alas, that game did not last long, 
I 
married got, to my misfortune, 
From that day every penny flew, 
For soon I 
spent the marriage portioi, 
On my wedding-day these clothes were new 
We went to church, so blythe and merry, 
This hat of mine was new and light, 
We drank our crusted port and sherry, 
And ev'ry eye was beaming bright. 
But you, poor hat, ean tell the hist'ry 
Of where we go, and what we do, 
But how you stand it is a 
misery— 
Think of the days when you were new. 
And you, poor coat, have got quite seedy 
I 
never cuffed you, speak the truth, 
You cannot say that I 
was greedy, 
I 
filled your pockets, yes, forsooth, 
For ev'ry morning you I 
studied, 
And after dinner open threw, 
And seldom were you skirts e'er muddied, 
I 
kept a 
trap when you were new. 
And you, poor boots, were bright as any, 
You really were a 
lovely pair. 
Cleaning you've cost many a 
penny, 
I 
took you with me ev'rywhere, 
Big farewell to the soles departed— 
For my poor toes they do peep through--
And you, poor tops, look quite faint-hearted, 
How different now, then you were new. 
And you. poor gloves, my hands did slaelter, 
Yet still I 
held you in my love, 
We through the world went helter skelter, 
Like true friends, living hand and glove. 
But farewell, clothes, Wq part too soon. 
Ti 
for a 
pauper'c suit, grey or blue. 
I 
newt die in a 
poor-law union, 
IR 
clothes I 
habe, though perhaps quite new. 
A. Parody on " Just Bofors the Battle, Mother." 
Just before the battle, mother, (hie) 
I 
was thinking least of you, 
While upon the field we're spreeing, (hie) 
With the enemy in view. 
Comrades ( hic) drunk around me lying, 
Filled with bitters made by Dod, 
For well they know that on the morrow 
Some will lie drunk on (hic) the sod. 
CHOPXS. 
Farewell, mother, you may never, (hie) never 
See me sober home again; 
But, oh ! you'll not forget me, mother, 
If dead with " Bourbon on the brain." 
Oh, I 
long to have, dear mother, 
A demijohn sent me from home ; (hic) 
First thing at morn I 
like my bitters, 
Ere to picket post (hie) I 
roam. 
Tell the traitors all around you, 
That (hic) their cruel deeds, we know, 
In every instance, kill our soldiers 
With their stuff called " Kill (hic) me slow." 
Farewell, mother, eke. 
Hark, I 
hear the fish-horn sounding, 
'Tis the signal ( hic) for a 
muse; 
May I 
get no bruises, mother, (hic) 
As I 
join into this fuss. 
Hear the battle-cry of (hic) Bourbon, 
how it swells upon the air ; 
Oh, yes, I'll rally round the bottle, 
And get blind drank (hie) while I 
an there. 
Farewell, motley, Jrc. 
THE HURDY GURDY LAD. 
I 
don't feel very happy, nor I 
don't feel very sad, 
So put me down as middling, although it is too bad; 
For any girl to serve a 
chap, as lately I've been served, 
But no girl shall take me in again, I'll never take their word. 
A 
girl I 
courted for six months, her Christian name was Fanny, 
I 
asked her if she'd have me, and she said she would be glad ; 
But at present her intention was to stay home with her mammy, 
And she couldn't think of parting with.,her dear old darling dad. 
cnortUs. 
Yes, she said 'twould break her heart 
To go and leave her mammy, 
She said 'twould break her heart, 
To go and leave her dad ; 
But she's run away from both, 
My false, deceitful Fanny, 
And travels about the country, 
With a 
Hunly Curdy Lad. 
Now Fanny wasn't handsome, but I 
thought she was sincere, 
And then she had such winning ways, that made me her myere, 
But a 
hurdy-gurdy grinder, he used to come our way, 
And for Fanny's recreation, for hours he used to play ; 
Ile:d play awhile, then dance a 
bit, and then he'd sing a 
ditty, 
And I 
often gave a 
penny to the dirty half-grown man, 
lie said he was an orphan, that caus'd me him to pity. 
'But never thought he'd cheek enough to run away with Fan. 
And as for her, she said, & c. 
Her father and mother were very fond of me, 
And often did invite me my Fanny for to see, 
I 
found her father ' bacca, and I 
found her mother nun. 
And on Fanny I 
invested a 
very tidy sum, 
t,For Fanny was a 
girl I 
always thought so well of; 
' 
When I 
think how she served me, it my peace of mind destroys, 
Now of Old Mother Cummings I'd often heard tell of, 
But I 
never thouglat she'd run off with the biggest of her boys. 
For she said, etre. 
Now when her fatiwr told me that Fan had cut her stick, 
I 
felt as if I 
had received a 
blow with half a 
brick, 
For I 
alway thought that Fanny, a 
little more pride had, 
Than to travel about the country with a 
hurdy-gurdy lad. 
I 
hear she's got a 
tambourine, and a 
voice that's loud and ringing 
And often in my wanderings. I 
fancy I 
shall meet 
This hurdy-gurdy grinder, and Fanny doing the singing, 
Giving a 
morning concert to some children in the street. 
For she said, ,t7e 
cS  
gc THE SPADE." 
Give me the Spade and the man who can use it ; 
A fig for your lord, and his soft silken hands. 
Let the man who has strength never stoop to abuse it, 
Give back to the giver— the land, boys, the land. 
There's no bank like the Earth to deposit your labor, 
The more you deposit the more you shall have ; 
If there's more than you want you can give to your neigh-
bor, 
And your name shall be dear to the true and the brave. 
CHORUS. 
Give me the Spade, &e. 
Give me the Spade—the American's glory— 
That fashions the field from the bleak barren moor, 
Let us speak of its praise in ballad and story, 
While ' tis brightened with labor, not tarnished 
gore. 
It was not the Sword that won our best battles, 
Create I 
our Commerce, extended our Trade. 
Gave food for our wives, our children, our cattle, 
But the Queen of all weapons— the Spade, boys, the 
Spade. 
with 
Give nie the Spade, & e. 
Give me the Spade. there's a 
magic about i 
t, 
That turns the black soil into bright shining gold, 
What would our fathers have done. boys, without, 
When this land lay all bare and the north wind blew 
cold. 
Where the tall forests stood, and the wild beasts were yell-
ing. 
Where out stout-hearted ancestors shrank back afraid— 
Now the cornstack is raised and have cleared a 
dwelling, 
Then Hurrah for our true friend, the Spade, boys, the 
Spade. 
Give me the Spade, 8ce.

The weather it was very warm 
The Commissioners axed me if I'd go 
And settle upon a

No, says I, I'll go back to New-York, 
Where the Politicks they are so pretty,

But be jabers I'll stick to the City.

PANAMA. 
A S 
Sting by JOHNNY EOACH. 
Once I 
was a 
waterman and lived at home at ease. 
But now I al a 
marrineer and plow the raging seas ; 
I 
thought I'd like a 
sea-fareing life to visit lands afar, 
60 I 
sailed away from Calico Bay on board the Panama. 
(7,110 RUS . 
Then heave away my hearties we're bound for lands afar. 
As we sailed away from Calico Bay on board the Panaina. 
Our ship she lay at anchor, in the fam'd Jersey canal. 
She was a 
great and noble ship, des,.ribe her now I 
shall ; 
Iler cabin w 
as on her second deck, through a 
ladder down 
the hole. 
And we were bound for Wigan, me boys, to get a 
big load 
of coal. 
Then heave. away, & e. 
Our captain was a 
sturdy man, he stood just six feet three. 
His hair was red, his eyes were green, and his mouth as 
big as three ; 
lie could beat the world at drinking grog, you might 
search both near and far. 
And his wife she was first mate, rue boys, on board of the 
Panama. 
Then heave away, & c. 
We sailed three days before the mast, when the water it 
got short. 
And every hour each man, me boys, lie, was allowed a 
qintrt ; 
We were in latitude a 
hundred and one, no land tor many a 
mile, 
And all the provisions we had on board was a 
bottle of 
Castor Oil. 
Then heave away, & e. 
We fell in with a 
big sand junk bound for a 
foreign shore, 
it's thunder and sparibles said I. me boys. ni go to sea 110 
more; 
We had to sail east. west, north and south to keep clear of 
ships in the bay, 
And three years after that, me boys, we landed dov..11 
Broadway. 
Then heave away, Sc. 
Our captian he gave orders for talon to clear the deck, 
When the man at the wheel fell through the hole and 
nearly broke hie neck ; 
I 
holler'd at my menmates till I 
was black in the face, 
But she turned out to be a. Chinaman and bound for St. 
Mark's Place.

WRECKED AND SAVED, 
Words by J. BENDMIL.—Mtitic by W. KNOWLES 
The day was fair, the sun was bright, 
Our ship so gaily dress'd, 
All hearts ware bounding with delight, 
Not one with fear oppress'd. 
The anchor weigh'd, each sail was spread 
To catch the fresh'nin,g breeze, 
And on our way we swiftly sped, 
Upon the boundless seas. 
But soon a 
dreadful storm began, 
The livid light'ning 
The troubled seas like mountains ran, 
The troubled seas like mountains ran, 
The troubled seas like mountains ran, 
And loud the thunder crash'd. 
The raving waters swept the deck 
And shiver'd ey'ry mast, 
All sails were gone, the ship a 
wreck. 
And down- ward sinking fast. 
Our Captain calm, serene his brow, 
The fearful sentence gave, 
" 
We're lost, no pow'r can help as now, 
The sea must be our grave." 
E'en then we wept not in despair 
Tho' hope of life had flown. 
But raim'd one voice in holy pray'r, 
To lleavn's benignant throne. 
The last farewell, the last good-bye 
-We gave, for death seened near. 
When ho ! a 
sail, a 
ship comes nigh. 
Tha.ak God, thank God, thine aid is near. 
Hurrah we're say'd now homeward bound. 
The ship _speeds on arnaln. 
Soon shall our joyous shout resound 
In England once again. 
Hurrah ! we're sav'd, now homeward bound 
The ship speed a 
on amain. 
Soon shall our joyous shout resound 
in England once again.

THE STYLE IN WHICH IT'S DONE. 
As Sung by BILLY Corros. 
I 
stand before you once again, 
A few words just to say ; 
The subject ot my song I'm sure, 
We each meet. every day. 
Soule men live last and others slow, 
As tnrough the world we run; 
But so very much depends upon 
The style in which it's done.

A man shall steal a 
horse, we read, 
And not be 
brought to book ; 
While ; mot her man across a

This may seem contradictory, 
Indeed, to many a 
one; 
But so very notch depends- upon 
The style in which it 
done. 
Tire politician speechifies. 
And makes a 
great hurrah, 
Till another man he mounts the stand, 
Arid points out every /law. 
Be gets the nomination. 
And tor Congress he does run ; 
Sueeeeds and laughs to think he knows 
The style in which it's done. 
Nov has it ne'er occurred to you, 
Ilow strange the mystery seems; 
That girls can dash along IlroadwaV, 
Who scaree are in thei een ,,? 
Their pas are poor, hut 4111 they dress. 
in a 
style that's number one. 
B••t lsuppose it all depends upon 
Tile style in which it's done. 
I 
think I'll cone in 
Inv song.

But I 
hope that I 
have pleased you 
With my little bit of rhyme. 
Some may think it is too short 
And others it's too long: 
But very much depends upon 
The style in which it's done. 
THE COT IN THE CORNER. 
35 
Suire by Wm 
F. SINCLAIR LAwLoa, in the laughable sketch of Barney 
and the Ghost, as performed by CuAs. AlAc EVOY'S original 
Hiberuieou Troupe. 
Oeh hone, wirrastrew, how hard is our IGt, 
The landlord has turned us out of our cot, 
To us in this world ' t 
was the happiest spot, 
On the hill-side beyant in the corner ; 
The roof was thatched over with bright yellow straw, 
And the walls were as white as the snowflake ag-ra, 
Oh it was a 
fine picture a 
painter might draw, 
From the boreen beyant in the corner. 
It was purty without, it was tidy within, 
On the shelves, shone like silver, our plate made of the 
Which cast some refieetions when sunlight stole in, 
On the dog and the (.. f
lt in the corner; 
Of bacon, galore, we had many a 
flitch in 
The wide mouthed chimney, that yawned in the kitchen, 
Oh % would make your mouth wilier, and eager to pitch in 
To the hames that hung high in the corner. 
And there by the fire my mother would knit, 
And close to her side in (. 111(1 father would sit, 
What stories he'd tell when his dudeen was lit, 
While lie smoked away in the corner; 
When supper was over the neighbors dropped in, 
And by the turf fire each roasted his shin, 
While the boys and the girls ne'er thought it a 
sin 
For to hug and to kiss in the corner. 
When Jimm..„- she piper walked in on the floor, 
The young people all made a 
rush for the door, 
Dragging Jun my along to the ham, and sure 
They placed him high up in the corner ; 
Then at it they went dear with 111•8 Ns light and gay, 
And danced the night hours into the young day, 
'Till Jimmy got drunk an' no longer could play, 
For he lay pipes and all in the corner. 
36 
THE CYMBAL MAN. 
I'm going to tell the public the way that I've been served, 
And when they hear my story they'll know what makes me so 
unnerved. 
'Twas a 
called Mary, whom I 
loved—she promised me her 
heart and hand, 
But she left me for a 
fellow whom she thought was much more 
grand, 
'Cause he played upon the Cymbals in a 
military Band. 
CHORUS. 
Clin ,r, clang, the Cymbals went, the Cymbals went, 
Didn't lie think himself a 
gent, as he marched in the middle of 
the Band. 
I 
dropped in quite promiscuously to take a 
cup of tea, 
t 
was earlier than usual, I 
dire say half' pa:t three, 
I 
was eating of a 
muffin, ‘N 
ben my girl held up her hand, 
And says, my dear, now don't you hear, a 
military Band, 
Don't you sec that darling fellow there, oh, dont he look quite 
grand. 
Cling, clang, /U. 
You can judge of my astonishment to hear her talking thus, 
And of that beastly Cymbal fellow making such a 
fuss, 
Mary, I 
exclaimed, with jealous rage, which I 
could scarce with-
stand, 
I'm sorry you take such interest in a 
military Band, 
'Cause fellows dressed in uniforms you always think looks grand. 
clang, ct:c. 
For a 
while I 
had to leave tier, , n 
the country I'd a 
job, 
I 
little thought that any one, my happiness would rob. 
When I 
returned and heard the news why I 
could scarcely stand, 
he skedaddled with that Cymbal man, who she thought looked 
so grand, 
But I'll smash his Cymbals on his head when I 
catch him in his 
Band, 
Cling, clang, Eke. 
I'LL HAVE YOUR NUMBER. 
While walking out the other day a 
pretty girl I 
met, 
She was indeed a 
charmer. I 
never can forget, 
I 
followed her for near a 
mile and to my great surprise, 
She smilingly touched a knocker and vanished from my 
eyes. 
CHORUS. 
But I've got the number, the number, the number, 
I've got the number, it's 3G-12. 
Half mad with love I 
called a 
cab, and asked him for to 
drive, 
To number 3G-V2 away down in Cheapside, 
Ofl he went with all his might, and drunk I 
have no doubt, 
Upset the cab and killed the horse and threw me slap bang 
out. 
But I've got his number, &c. 
While embracing mother earth. a 
Peeler quickly said, 
Move on, old chap, quickly too, or I'll punch your head, 
And there to mend the matter, this most inhuman pup, 
Said I 
was drunk, and could not stand, and swore he'd lock 
tile up. 
I've got his number, &c. 
The mob assemble3 in the street, came jostling around, 
Soon assisted me to rise from off the filthy ground, 
I 
stood like one bewildered, and wildly gazed about, 
As all these inhuman dogs like demons 'holler'd out, 
I've got his number, lte.

JOHNNY ROACH'S VERSION 
OF " CASTLES INTHE AIR." 
This world is all a 
bubble, wherever we may go; 
There's nothing here but troubles, hardship, toil and woe; 
Go where we will, do what we may, we are never free from 
care, 
And at the best, this world is but a 
Castle in the Air. 
We are rocked upon the sea of life, just like a 
little boat, 
And some get wrecked upon the rocks, and never get afloat; 
But we will do the best we can, and never let despair 
Usurp the place between us, and our Castles in the Air. 
There is a 
name known o'er the world, to Englishmen 'tis dear. 
And well may they be proud of him, their native Bard Shake-
speare ; 
When first his plays came on the stage, he made the world stare 
And yet they wtre composed, while building CaAles in the Air, 
if you take the works of Shakespeare, and study hem well 
through, 
You'll find his sayings are so wise, each sentiment so true; 
They'll make you feel while reading them, as if you had been 
there, 
And yet they were composed while building Castles in the Air. 
But yet there is another name, to Scotchmen dearer s 
ill, 
And though a 
real true Scottish heart, ' twill make the blood to 
thrill, 
And lhough this world to him had been, a 
world full of care ; 
Yet Burns was always happy, building Castles in the Air. 
His home a 
lowly Ploughman's Cot, yet strife there ne'er was 
seen, 
So happy and contented had he lived wee his Jean; 
[
1] 
JOHNNY ROACH'S, &C.—[CONCLUDED. 
Beside the bank 0. Bonny Doon, near to the town 0' Ayr, 
The immortal Bobby Burns, built bright Castles in the Air. 
The Irish had their poet too, they loved him well I'm sure, 
He was a 
true born Irishman, his name was Thomas Moore ; 
Of this woral's sorrows, we know he had his share, 
Yet Moore was always happy, building Castles in the Air. 
Ile sang the rights of Ireland, he sa g 
against her wrongs, 
And many loving Irish hearts, will cherish yet his songs ; 
He made the Irish heart rejoice he ba ! e 
them ne'er despair, 
And for Ireland in the future, built bright Castles in the Air. 
The G..rmans are not found behind in poets that are clever, 
But one HI name that won great fame, I 
mean Frederick Von 
Schiller, 
And he was born at Marback in fatherland so fair, 
Where many an hour he did beguile building Castles in the Air; 
And though he was imprisoned once he still kept on his way, 
And wrote the songs of his country's wrongs and turned them 
into play, 
And many a 
one translated is read both near and far, 
For other nations love to read his Castles in the Air. 
And yet there is another name, Americans adore, 
A 
statesman when in time of peace, a 
lion when in war 
Whether storming Bunker Inn, or on the De!aware, 
His genitH made his soldiers build bright Castles in the air. 
And in his country's darkest hours he nobly led the van, 
And strove to make America the brightest of all lands ; 
Though he was not a 
poet born, he planned with skill and care, 
'Twas our immortal Washington built bright Civtles in the Air.

She read so much of Mormonites, of nothing else she'd 
talk,

She said he was a

BILLY JOHNSON'S BALL .—[CONCLUDED.] 
There were the Jones-es-es, and the Brown-es-es, 
And the Smith-es-es a 
score, 
The Spriggins-es, the Scoggins-es, 
And half a 
dozen more; 
In Billy's room, there wasn't room, 
To dance a 
decent jig, 
So he went and took a 
hi.- one 
At The Tinder-box and Pig." 
Spoken.—Au efficient band was provided, consisting of a 
fiddle, 
a 
tin whistle, and a 
Jew's harp and they played—Clio. 
They introduced the baby, 
And we kissed it twice all round, 
Mrs. Johnson was quite "overcome," 
Fell fainting to the ground. 
But they " brought her to" with water, 
And " a 
drop of something in," 
And when " she felt herself again," 
The dancing did begin. 
OHO. 
In and out and round about, 
Such a 
ball was never seen, 
And every now and then, 
We'd " a 
drop to drink between," 
Billy Johnson be got dancing 
With all the girls he'd find, 
Mrs. Johnson she grew jealous, 
And declared he was " unkind." 
Spoken.—I 
make it a 
rule never to interfere in family quarrels' 
so I 
chose a 
lovely creature in red and yellow, and we glided into 
the—Cao. 
I 
drank " love" to the Jones-es, 
I 
drank " love" to the Browns, 
I 
tried to keep on dancing, but 
'Twas somehow " ups and downs," 
To tell you how it ended, 
I 
really am not able, 
For I 
found myself next morning 
Lying underneath the table. 
Spoken.—I 
felt rather confused till a 
friend reminded at that 
I 
Lad been doing the—Cuo.

COSTERMONGER JOE. 
As sung by JOHNNY ROACH with great success. 
I'm Costermonger Joe. and as my rounds I

For many a

With mind devoid of care, and spirits light as air, 
I

I 
started young in t

nice connection made 
Along- the streets, the avenues and squares. 
Now all I

While " Ned," my little donkey, draws my wares, draws lay wares--
While Ned, my little donkey, draws my warts.

Anil yet to barely live, why, I

Or none would deal or grease the wheel for Costermonger Joe. 
It's not the likes of me you in the paper see, 
Petitioning- the court fey a

TONY PASTOR's great Sensation Song. 
Al a.— 
This song basbo-n 
for nightly for months in succession and 
having been song by Mr PAsTon in his own inimitable slsle, has be. 
received with thunders of applanze.1 
Some say that Central Park's the place, 
For fun of every hind ; 
On Broadway and Fifth avenue 
Much pleasure others find. 
But Pm a 
different sort of chap 
No fun in that I 
see, 
For when I 
want enjoyment 
The Bowery for me. 
Spoken.—Yes. you may talk about your Broadway belles, your 
Fifth avenue swells, your exquisitely-dressed creatures, with 
their lavender kids, and their la-de-da's, now, what do they know 
about enjoyment? 
They are afraid to e.,-o 
in for a 
little fun for 
fear of disarranging- their toilets: and then what would Mrs. 
Grundy say ? ‘• Charles Frederick Augustus is gettirg decidedly 
vulgar ; Seraphina Ent elm is positively shocking !" 
But, here in 
the Bowery. people enjoy themselves just when tiny f 
el like it. 
They don't care a 
curse what others may say, for I 
hat's the cus-
tom. 
CII0 it us. 
In the Bowery, in the Bowery, 
For beautiful girls with bright eyes and dark curls, 
In the Bowery. in the Bowery, 
That's were I 
reside when I'm home. 
No butterflies of fashion there, 
Or idlers may be found, 
But men with open hearts and hands, 
With honest labor browned ; 
Men who, to help a 
friend in need, 
Would their last dollar lend, 
1Vho never live on ( titer folks, 
But earn the c!Ish they spend. 
Spoken.—Yes, there is no place in the Bowery for thcre well-
dressed corner statues to try to look like Millionaire 's sons, while 
their mothers are out scrubbing fi•r a 
dollar a 
day to su port 
them in idleness. 
A fellow has no business on the east side of 
town unless he wants to work and earn his own living.

The other day a

While walking through the street,

With whom he chanced to meet. 
A young mechanic came along, 
And heard the Ivords he said.

in protecting me iron] the insult,

And war o'erspread he land, 
When rushed unto Columbia's aid 
Each gallant hero band, 
Among the forem est on the field, 
Amid the battle's noise, 
Upholding still out starry flag, 
Was found the Bowery boys. 
Spoken—When the call came for soldiers in the horn' of danger, 
the Bowery was the first to send its volunteers, and nobly did 
they do their duty. 
Who does not remember that inci ,lent at

WHY DIDN 'T YOU SAY SO .
6EFORE. 
As su g 
by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
New by-words you know now-a-
days, are the rage, 
You'll hear them from every tongue ; 
Wherever you go you'll find that it's so, 
The little, the big, old and young; 
Even the ladies are fond of the slang, 
While the boys in 1 
he street loudly roar, 
Oh, how they do shout, t:te latest one out, 
Why didn't you s 
y 
so before I 
One day driven mad with a 
toothache so bad, 
T 
rushed to the first doctor's shop, 
When the grinder he eyed and the tongs he applied, 
And he pulled me six times round the shop; 
Said I, when he'd done, you've pulled out the wrong one, 
While with agony loud I 
did roar ; 
Now it's done, sir, says he, the fault don't lay with me; 
Why didn't you say so before 
I 
once asked a 
friend me ten dollars to lend, 
And said : Fd return it next day. 
When he did begin at once to rub his chin, 
And these words, unto me he did say ; 
Old boy, it's too bad, I 
should have been glad, 
In fact, I'd have let you have more 
had you called yesterday,— now, it's all paid away, 
Why didn't you say so before I 
My wife yesterday sat crying away, 
Because our first-born wai a 
boy; 
All day she would sigh and keep rubbing her eye, 
Instead of being happy ‘-,7ith joy ; 
• 
Says she to me, Joe, I 
hate boys, you know, 
I'd sooner of girls have a 
score; 
Says I ( with a 
leer) it's too late, now, my dear, 
Why didn't you say so before 
THE SWELL WITH A GLASS IN HIS EYE,. 
flow do you do, " my dear" boys— how do you do, 
You're looking remarkably well; 
No doubt you have met me before— 
'Twas at Long Branch, Broadway, or Palmall. 
By Jove you don't seem to remember. 
But you'll recollect me " by the by ;" 
By respectable people l'na known 
As the swell with a 
glass in his eye. 
For it gives a 
distinguished appearance, 
And as I 
go sauntering by; 
The darlings all sigh as though they would die 
Fur the swell with a 
glass in his eye. 
Some people delight in a 
moustache, 
And make it stick out like a 
pole; 
Some have their weakness o whiskers, 
But mine wouldn't grow 'pon my soul. 
Some people like the opera— 
Roman Fall, but I, bye the bye; 
Contented with my natural charms, 
As a 
swell with a 
glass in his eye. 
For it gives, dm, 
Some say can 1 
see any 13etter, 
No, by Jove, I 
can't see half as well; 
My sglit, is as good as most folks, 
Tho' I 
fancy the near-sighted swell. 
It makes a 
cove so interesting, 
When the low i:olks they call me a 
guy; 
Which meets with a 
sneer of contempt, 
From this small piece of glass in my eye.

PUT BY FOR A RAINY DAY. 
Oftirnes the world may laugh, and jeer at what I'm going to 
say, 
That is, provide yourselves, my friends, in case of a rainy 
day ; 
For if you don't, when you grow old, on what I 
say depend, 
If you can't help yourself, ' tis hard to find a 
friend. 
CHORUS. 
So now be careful, and be wise, and, like me, stow away, 
A little pelf, to protect yourself, in case of a 
rainy day; 
Be not extravagant or mean, have just what you require, 
Be kind and provident to all, it is my heart's desire: 
When I 
see my fellow creature is trodden down with strife, 
To help him ou the road is a 
proud time of my life. 
So now be careful, (Sic. 
" 
Waste not, want not," my motto is, a 
maxim I 
would teach, 
And this another I'd prescribe : " Touch nothing out of reach ;" 
For " honesty's best policy," so honest people say, 
And just remember, though but small, put up for a 
rainy day. 
So now be careful, & c. 
A pin a 
day, is a 
groat a 
year, which proves that the smallest 
mite 
Put by will soon accumulate, and shows my words are right ; 
So persevere when in your youth, and then when old you IL say, 
I 
care not now how the world treats Me, I 
thought of a 
rainy day. 
So now be careful, 
I'm hale, Fin jolly, as you can see, and I 
like my friends to call, 
Though the best oh friends I've ever feund, was my pocket, 
after all ; 
For that old friend sticks to me still, through thick and thin, 
I 
say, 
If you would be advised by me, put by for a 
rainy day. 
SO 
DOW be careful, ate. 
" 
A friend in need's a 
friend indeed," but how often when 
you re poor, 
Those friends will pass you on by one, and on you close the 
door ; • 
So let your motto be like mine, whate'er the world may say, 
Look out for number one, that is— put by fur a 
rainy day. 
So now be careful, hact. 
LITTLE MARY ANN.

In a 
quiet little village near the banks of a 
stream, 
Where poets love to wander and sweet music seems to dream, 
-Where the ivy-covered spire points aloft to happier spheres, 
And bids both 3
11..vung and old prepare to meet declining years, 
In a 
green and shady lane, long one I 
became a 
man, 
I 
whisper'd vows to heaven and my little Mary Ann. 
CHORUS. 
My little Mars' Ann, 
Sweet little Mary Ann, 
whisper'a vows to heaven and my little Mary Ann, 
But as years passed slowly on I 
impatiently did wait 
To reach that joyous time which gives to manhood its estate; 
When I 
should plow and mow and gaily sing the jocund song 
Of the husbandman %vho plods his %vay so merrily along. 
Then I 
did as duty bade roe, and ever sought a 
plan 
To enable me some summer's morn to %veil my Mary Ann. 
My little Mary Ann, & c. 
By industry I 
gained a 
little fortune of toy own, 
For well I 
knew what I 
would reap, must first be duly sown ; 
I 
bought a 
pretty cottage and a 
garden in full store, 
Where roses twined with honeysuckle graced the rustic door. 
Now my joy was near complete and to perfect make my plan, 
I 
hastened and I 
married my dear little Mary Anti. 
My Hai Mary Ann, & c. 
The squire of the village gave the bloomii:g bride away, 
And often have we called on him to c-lehriite the dal' ;

Find ninny a

Rich day our bliss increases since our weddine• life began, 
And the village swig from mon' to night is little Mary Ann.

THE GOAT. 
As Sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
Now my dear friends, I'm going to relate, 
If you pay attention, you've not long to wait; 
My father lived in a 
place called Gramote, 
He bad a 
sow, and a 
cow, and a 
fine billy goat. 
This goat, sure, he had a 
que: .r 
curious way, 
He'd go out every mornin g , 
and stop out all day
 
When he'd come lunne at night, like a 
bull he would roar, 
'Till in ,s 
father gets up for to open the door. 
One dny we sat down, and was going to ate, 
The goat leap'd on the table and sthole all the mate; 
And without saying a 
word, shine the wild dirty gommagh, 
lie dray his two horns in me poor father's stomach. 
Says me mother to me, " Jamsey," " Yis main," says I, 
fake that goat to the market, and sell him, now thry." 
The words she scarce spoke, when the goat gave a 
jump, 
And sthruck me mother, oh gorra! such a 
inurthering thump 
Then all the house bate a 
hasty retrate. 
And the goat backed away at the divil's own rate ; 
lie spied me father's coat hanging, he gave a 
loud bawl, 
Made a 
charge on the " frize," and druv his head in the wall. 
Some time after they went to look for the goat, . 
They searched all around, ' till they came to the coat. 
All of the goat that was left on the very next day, 
Was only the sthump of his tail, and it still bucking

On a 
still September day, 
Passing on a 
quiet street, 
Heard I 
voices all the way, 
Children's voices clear and sweet: 
By the church's open door ; 
Wistfully I 
lingered long, 
While my heart so sad and sore, 
Joined the children's holy song: 
Kyrie eleison! Christe eleison I 
Kyrie eleison ! Christe eleison! 
CHOBL'S. 
Kyrie eleison ! Christe eleison I 
Kyrie eleison ! Christ() eleison 
A-men ! A-men! 
Comforted I 
went away, 
Richer for that simple strain ; 
Many a 
night and many a 
day 
Heard that melody again ; 
And through years to come I 
know 
I 
shall hear it evermore 
And I 
heard it soft and low 
By the church's open door. 
Kyrie eleison ! Christ° eleison! 
Kyrie eleison! Christ° eleison! 
Kyrie eieison 1 
Christ° eleison &c. 
LEAVE ME TO SLEEP , 
BIDDY. 
As sung by JOHNNY ROACH, with great success. 
Backward and forward I'm reeling and tight— 
Oh, what a 
spree I've been on to- night ! 
I've been to McCarthy's with Patsey 
And we had the black bottle from under the bar ; 
We drank, and we drank, till we banished all care, 
And gave not a 
thought to foul weather or fair , 
And now, on the floor 
curled up in a 
heap— 
Oh! leave me to sleep, Biddy, leave me to sleep I 
CHORUS— Clasped to the pig, in a 
loving embrace, 
The hairs on his curly tail tickling my face-
- 
It's no use of telling me sober to keep ; 
So leave me to sleep, Biddy, leave me to sleep. 
Over my head in the days that are gone, 
Gayly I 
flourished my knotty black thorn. 
Oh. if I 
only but had it to- night, 
Maybe I 
wouldn't be oft for a 
fight! 
And if Pat Murphy I 
happened to meet, 
It's an illegant ruction we'd have in the street; 
He'd soon be mighty glad in a 
knot- hole to creep— 
At-rah ! leave me to sleep, Biddy, leave me to sleep.

SEVENTY-FIVE.

THE KISS BEHIND THE DOOR.

Sang With Greatest Success by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
By G. W. HUNT.

once I 
was as gay 
As a 
jolly young cock sparrow, 
Who's perch'd upon an apple tree, 
Or down amongst the corn. 
But now clean through my heart 
You could drive a 
large wheel barrow, 
For my love has left a 
hole in it.

where's Rosanna gone. 
CHORUS. 
I 
shall never kiss my love again behind the kitchen door, 
I 
shall never squeedge my darling's little finger any more. 
And she'll ne'er pinch my funny-bone until it's rather sore, 
Oh I 
where's Rosanna gone. 
I'm sure no other maid 
Could equal my Rosanna, 
Without my love this manly form 
Will soon become a 
wreck; 
Of her Dad I 
was afraid, 
He's a 
disa7reeable tanner, 
And he's often promised faithfully 
He'd dislocate my neck. 
So I 
use,1 t ) kiss Rosanna just behind the kitchen door. 
But I 
ne'er shall squeedge my darling's little finger any more, 
And she'll ne'er pinch my funny-bone, until it's rather sore,

THE KISS BEHIND THE DOOR.--10oxcurbz.D. 
Of an evening after tea, 
While her Daddy blew his `bacca,' 
I'd seek my love Rosanna, and 
Ask her to share my lot. 
But when he found it out, 
Oh my how he would whack her, 
While I'd jump over the garden wall, 
As tho' I'd just been shot. 
I 
shall never kiss my love, dm. 
I'd jumped over the wall one night, 
In search of sweet Rosanna, 
And tho' I 
gently whistled, 
My love did not appear; 
But my hair stood bolt npright, 
For out came her dad the tanner, 
Oh ! my teeth they rattled like dominoes, 
And my legs doubled up with fear. 
Spoken—At the end, of our interview I 
felt convinced that he 
understood what 'tanning' was, and so did I. 
I 
also concluded. 
I 
should never see my love, etc. 
Some say she's hid away, 
By her cruel Dad on purpose, 
To cure her of her love for me. 
Some say my love's no more. 
If she's defunct, then soon 
Shall they find my clay cold corpus, 
And our ghosts shall come and frighten her Dad 
Behind the kitchen door. 
So I 
used to kiss Rosanna just behind the kitchen door, 
But I 
ne'er shall squeedge my darling's little finger any more, 
And she'll ne'er pinch my funny-bone, until it's rather sore, 
0 
where's Rosanna gone?
