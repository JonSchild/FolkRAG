Kind friends if you will listen now, 
My woes I'll now tell 
My heart is nearly bro:en, 
And I 
don't know what to do ; 
No matter where I 
chance to go, 
Nor wherever I 
may be. 
The blackguards cry as I 
p 
tss by, 
OT.eily, you're N. G. 
If I 
go into a 
tavern. 
And call out for a 
boos. 
The gang S3.. S I must treat them 
Or their frendship I 
will lose ; 
And if I 
do refuse them, 
Their heads they shako at me, 
And sing out Philadelphia-
01/..L•ily, you are N. G. 
It was just before election 
I 
was called to make a 
Fpeech, 
For a 
friend of mine, 
Whose name was Thomas Lich ; 
The gang was there, I 
do declare, 
And when I 
did begin, 
They said, for God's sake, fire him out ! 
Where did he gA: his wind ? 
Fneetk a 
word at

They made such a 
terrible noise ; 
And all at once I 
felt a 
brick 
Hit me between the eyes, 
And through the door I 
fled, for sure ; 
Sure they meant to murder me 
And when I 
was outside 
I 
heard them cry. 
O'Reily. you are N. G. 
The slang the gang is usinc, now. 
You'll hear from every lip ; 
its shoot the hat ! and get it boiled ; 
And don't you lose your grip ! 
They say I'm too fresh, and too bran new, 
And will I 
ever drop, and stag his nips, 
And skip the gutter, and hit him with a 
mop. 
The chil..:ren thcro are using the slang, 
As well as every one. 
They'll s 
iy to me go take a 
bath ! 
And why don't I 
take a 
run? 
And then they'll say. 
Go stop the cat. so long as Tra la la lee!

I'M TOULD YOU CARRY A

[Copyright,, 1875, by PAT ROONEY.] 
Written by ITAREY BENNETT, expressly for PAT ROONEY, 
and sung with great success by him at the Olympic Theatre. 
My name is Pat McAlister, in the Fourth Ward I 
belong ; 
I 
am no politician, though my principles are strong. 
I 
like this City well enough, but here I 
cannot stop ; 
Go where I 
may, they're sure to say, I'm tould you carry a 
POP. 
('nouns. 
The blackguards do make fun of me, 
And when I 
bid them stop, 
They say, now " cheese it, - Old Times Rocks. 
I'm tould you carry a 
pop. 
I 
don't know what they mane at all, they think that they 
are smart ; 
They say to me, go hire a 
hall, and tell me I'm too tart ; 
They tell me to go bounce myself, and call me old boy crop, 
But divil a 
word like this I've heard, I'm tould you carry 
a 
pop. 
The blackguards, &e. 
They call me tough man, and they say I 
carry a 
spoon in 
my boot ; 
They howl from ev,ry corner, stag the pigeon-toed galute. 
And when I 
walk along the stred they call ma lifty-go-hop, 
And crack it light, ould coffin back, I'm tould you carry 
a 
pop.

TIM FLAHERTY. 
[Copyright, 1572, by JOHN CHURCH k Co.] 
Sung with great success by PAT ROONEY. 
I'm a 
lighthearted Paddy, a 
rate Irish laddy, 
I 
went to America strange wonders to say ; 
I 
sailed from dear Cork for the port of New York, 
I 
was eighteen long da3 s 
a 
crossing the say. 
When I 
arrived in the land I 
was tuck by the hand 
By a 
blaggard who said, " Paddy, come go with me, 
And I 
will show you the city, the sights are so pretty." 
He says, " What's your name ?" says I " Tim Flaherty?' 
CHOR 
I'm Tim Flaherty, arah, gaze upon me ; 
A 
lighthearted Paddy is Tim Flaherty. 
He showed me around, the sights were soon found, 
I 
viewed them with wonder and astonishment : 
When he bade me good-bye, cata-t came in my eye, 
I 
found he'd been through me, and took iv'ry cint, 
What to do I 
didn't know, where was I 
to go ; 
So I 
whit to the Coort, and explained to the Judge. 
He called me a 
pauper, a 
vagrant and loafer, 
And gave me six months in the I 
land above. 
fin Tim Flaherty, tVc • 
So I 
shouldered my bundle, and homeward I 
wandered, 
Ould Erin forever, oh, she is my joy ! 
It's here I'm at home and never will roam, 
For she's good enough for a 
vale Irish boy. 
Sure, there's whiskey galore, just here by the door. 
And beauties you ne'cr can find afar o'er the say ; 
And the girls are so pretty, so nate and so witty, 
And that's just what suits the lad, Tim Flaherty.

MULOAHEY'S SISTER KATE, 
Air—" Mulcahy's gone away." 
YOU have heard them sing of a 
hero bold, 
Mulcahy was his name: 
And, faith 
he had o 
sister, too, 
Was not&l for her fame: 
She was chief-cook in a 
boarding house, 
And at making a 
hash was gr at; 
She came from the County Dynegole, 
And her maiden name was' Kate. 
CHORUS. 
She is tall and thin, 
With her crooked shin: 
And her age was twenty-eight, 
Her cheeks were red, 
And so was the head 
Of Mulcahey's sister Kate. 
She treats me like a 
lady 
Wh n 
her I 
g • to see; 
e 
s me into the kitchen, 
And treats me to cakes and tea, 
And ofthnes I 
used to sit until 
It was very late, 
An I 
wills:wring my love story to 
Mulcahey's sister Kate, 
CHORUS. —She is tall and thin, etc. 
I 
thought she was an angel 
When I 
kept her company; 
But in the course of time I 
found 
That he \vas fooling me; 
I 
went to her house, one night, 
And standing by the gate, 
I 
saw a 
greasy soapfat-man 
A-hugging my darling Kate. 
CitoRus.—She is tall and thin, etc.

I 
STARTED in the race of Ii e 
With hopes and fancies mountains high; 
I 
won the tight in every strife, 
And left my hopes no chance to die. 
Great fortunes I

And o'er the world I've ra ubled far, 
While ev .rywhere it was my boast

mansion big and grand, 
And spend my fortune gay a d

And gladly till the beggars hand,—

I'll secitlate without a

Of " Bulls" or " Bears" opposing war, 
And while I 
win their gold so dear 
I'll bless my bright and " lucky star." 
Chorus.— The " Big Bonanza," Scol 
I'll search around my soci d 
sphere, 
And fall in love with some sweet n.aid; 
For love alone can cheer my home— 
The " Big Bonanza" gives me aid; 
And When I 
m wed and settled down, 
And voices ' round me cry " Papa," 
I'll bless the day so far away 
When first I 
saw my " lucky star,"

I'M Paddy Miles, an Irish boy, just come across the sea, 
For singing or far dancing, boys, I 
think that I'll please ye ; 
I 
can sing and dance with any man, as I 
did in days of yore, 
And on Patrick's Day I 
love to wear the Hat me father wore, 
CHORUS. 
It's old, but it's beautiful—the best you ever seen; 
'Twas worn for more than ninety years in that little Isle so 
green. 
From my father's great ancestors it descended with gallore— 
It's a 
relic of old dacency, is the hat me father wore. 
I 
bid you all good evening—good luck to you I 
say, 
And when. I 
cross the ocean I 
hope for me you'll pray; 
I'm going to my happy land in a 
place called Ballymore. 
To be welcomed back to Paddy's land with the hat me father 
wore. 
It is old, etc. 
And when I 
do return again the boys and girls to see. 
I 
hope that with old Erin's style you'll kindly welcome me, 
With the songs of dear old Ireland to cheer me more and 
more, 
And make me Irish heart feel glad with the hat me father 
wore. 
It's old, etc.

THERE'S a

My Duddeen, &C. 
A Frenchman smokes the little thing 
They call the cigarette, 
It makes him feel uneasy, 
As he blows, and puffs, and frets. 
The Chinese smokes the opium, 
'Till it puts him in a

And the Yankee smokes the bad cigar, 
W

But every Irishman--
Boni.' Patsey, Mike or Dan, 
That was born in dear old Ireland, 
Where the grasses grow so green, 
If they've no coat to their back, 
Tlley've that hit of clay so black; 
It's a 
consolation to them,

THE TIPPERARY MEN, 
BEAUTIFUL GIRL OF KILDARE, 
Sung only by DiAmoND and RYAN. 
KIND friends we've just come over, 
From old Ireland right away, 
For the times they were so very bad, 
No longer we could stay; 
For meat and irink we could not get, 
The landlords kept 
poor, 
fill at last we had to bid adieu, 
To Erin's lonely shore. 
CHORUS. 
Although we're far away, my boys, 
We love _ireltind just the same. 
At a 
light or fair, you'll find us there, 
We're both Tipperary men. 
They say no Irish need apply, 
Sure, that I 
don't undrstand, 
For where do they gef., St:L.2. brave big boys, 
As those from Padcty's . and; 
If Britain was to go to war, boys, 
What would she do then, 
Unless the ranks were well hued up 
With Tipperary men, 
Although we're far away, etc. 
If you happen to go to Ireland, 
Hospitality you'll that there, 
If a 
poor man has only a 
drink of milk, 
By my soul you'll got your share; 
No matter friends, how poor you be, 
Its there you':1 1111(1 a

Yes, warm- headed you will find, 
The Pdperary men.

MY name is McNamarra,

It's the seventeenth of March, 
Whim as stiff as starch,

For it's down Broadway I 
march so gay 
Wid Cornelius, Barney and Pat— 
The people shout whin I 
turn out, 
And parade with my old hat, 
That hat was made In Dublin, 
In the Year of ninety-eight; 
'Twas never called in and ye can't begtt 
To say it' oaf of datx1 
It's traveled the wide world over, 
From Ireland to Bombay, 
And the only time it can be seen 
Is on St. Patrick's day. 
Thin give three cheers for the hat I

Before it is too late, 
And nine more cheers for Patrick's day, 
The day we celebrate, 
And when you see me on parade, 
I'll raise me hat to ye, 
I'll invite ye all to come and call, 
And join my company.

Should politicians turn to hod carriers, 
And the world turn upside down ! 
Should Martin Short, the detective, 
Subject himself to a

We'd not give up our noble tread 
For 100 pounds in gold ; 
For we're as solid as ;,tone walk--
At least that's what we're 1old. 
We walk behind, &c. 
So now we bid you all good-night! 
But hope to call again ; 
And when we do, we'll tell to you,

Where laboring men are pl ,nty, 
And politics they are few ; 
But face 10 face. with the public, 
The advice we give to you -

THAYER, the greatest Clown of the Northwest 
The Hero of my humble song 
Was once a 
mighty Man. 
A 
shining light in his neighborhood. 
And chief of all his clan ; 
But when he found in course of time 
The tricks his friends did play, 
Sure he left them all, and now they cry, 
Mulcaby's gone away! 
CH(MuS. 
He was great and grand, and took command 
Of the boys on Patrick's day; 
But now the cry is everywhere. 
Mulcahy's gone away I 
He won our pride and won our pmts., 
And he deserved it too! 
Sure many a 
time tor nights and days 
We stuck to him like glue; 
He held an office of the State, 
And faith he made it pay; 
But for such a 
place he was too great, 
And nos^ he's gone away! 
He was great. & 
4ft 
The politicians worshipped him, 
And swore he'd yet be Mayor; 
And tho' *he chance looked rather dim, 
He thought it bright and fair; 
But ere he came to rule the town, 
His mind was led astray, 
And now the cry is everywhere, 
Mulcahy's gone away 
He was great, Jtif 
He was as sound a 
Democrat 
As ever filled a 
chair, 
But he lost his great position, 
And it drove him to despair; 
We know not where to seek for him; 
He must have crossed the say; 
0, it grieves us just to think of it— 
Malcaby's gone away! 
He was great, ath 
lie treated us like gintlemen 
Whenever we did meet; 
The sight of him would do you good, 
From his head down to his feet; 
He wore a 
collar stiff and high. 
Which made a 
great display; 
He was a 
most distinguished man,.., 
But now he's gone away I 
He was great, dAx 
The girls went crazy when he winked, 
And many an artful plan 
They put in operation for 
To catch this darlin' man; 
But now they're left alone, poor things; 
They weep and wail, and my 
Oh, what'll we do at all? 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He was great, &&

never shall forget the day I

And he a 
bold milishee boy, so happy, gay and free, 
in the gallant " Sixty- Ninth," I 
jilted the ranks of Company 
They put me in the " Awkward Squad," wid about a 
dozen 
more. 
Witl a 
musket on me shoulder, sure they made me walk the

We march'd unto the right and left, until me feet were sore, 
When we were in the thnid " Awkward Squad."

" 
Lift ! Lift !" the sargint used to say, 
-Now ye's have it ! can't ye keep it? 
Turn yer head this way ! 
Right about! Shoulder arms ! " 
An hour every day, 
Whin we were in the timid " Awkward Squad," 
I 
found it very ditlikilt to keep the step at all, 
Along wid all the others when paradin' in the Hall; 
At aich mistake I 
used to make, the sargint he would say: 
Yer as awkward as the divil; doan't ye hould yer gon that

But he at least wel;;Ii'd twenty stone, while I 
was very slim, 
From marching in the timid " Awkward Squad." 
Chorus.—" Lift! Lift :" 
Whin we're considered compitant, into the company 
They'll put us in the ranks at wanst, and there they'll let us be; 
And undher sargint's orders thin no longer we'll plod, 
Shouldher arms and counther marchin' in the timid " Awkward

Whin out into the straw we go to have a

We'll be looked upon wid pride, me boys, by every servant

Anti wid the sargint on our right no more we'll be afraid,

For being so uncivil to the timid `• Awkward Squad." 
And if they should retalyate or give me any talk, 
rejuice them to the ranks at wance, and there I'll make 'eta

If that ain't punishment enough, " like any other gawk,"

IT'S many years ago in Irelanl, you must know, 
Since happiness looked down on our land, 
Our sons they then were free and the star of liberty, 
Shone gloriously on every Irishman. 
But let us bar the door on the days that are no more, 
There's a 
light a 
beaming on us from afar, 
If you listen unto inc I 
will tell you, do you see, 
The sentiments of Pat of,Mullingar. 
C1101W s. 
Hurrah for Erin's Isle, though her sons you can beguile, 
Because they lt:low the wolf is at the door, 
Yet may our flag be seen aloft la College Green, 
And a 
Home Rule in Ireland evermore. 
In England they may boast that our Parliament is lost, 
And say that we never should complain; 
Would you have my heart be light when I 
know for this vety 
right, 
My c9untrym n 
are wishing o'er the main. 
Gladstone he may rave but our country for to save, 
These words they should be heard from shore to shore, 
For O'Connell he did say, hefore he passed away, 
A Home Rule for Ireland for evermore. 
Chorus, — Hurrah for, &A. 
There's one now in hid grave who struggled hard to sue, 
Our country from oppression long ago, 
Henry Grattan is his name and may Heaven be his gab, 
His energy on Ireland did best— w. 
His voice he never gave oar people to enslave, 
Nor drive them to a 
flr and distant shore, 
May the ilowerlets ever wave upon our hero's grave, 
And a 
Home Rule in Ireland for evermore. 
Chorus. —Hurrah for, &.4. 
Chorus.— Hurrah for, &t.. 
There'3 a 
laurel for the brow of the one who's striving now, 
To win our Legislature back again, 
John Martin, ever bold our misery to unfold, 
And Ireland for the Irish will maintain. 
But let us all unite to drink this toast to-night, 
May happiness revisit Erin's shore, 
And the plan of Isaac Butts, from the palace to the bete, 
Be a 
Home Rule for Ireland for everm re.

H ARDING, 229 Bowery, N. V. 
As sting by Myr..Es Monras, at the 'theatre Comique, N. Y. 
With deep affection and recollection, 
often think of those Shandon 
Whose sounds so wild would in days of childhood 
Fling round my cradle their magic spell ; 
On this I 
ponder, where'er I 
wander, 
And then grow fonder, sweet Cork of thee; 
With thy bells of Shandon sound far more grand on 
The pleasant waters of the river Lee. 
I've heard bells chiming full many a 
clime in, 
Tolling sublime in cathedral shrine ; 
While at a 
glibe rate brass tongues would vibrate, 
But all their music spoke naught like thine; 
For rnem'ry dwelling, on each proud swelling 
Of thy belfry, knelling its bold notes free, 
Made the bells of Shandon sound far more grand on 
The pleasant waters of the river Lee. 
I've heard bells tolling " Old Adrain's mole" in, 
Their thunders rolling from the Vatican, 
With cymbals glorious, swinging uprorious, 
In the gorgeous turrets of Notre Dame ; 
But thy sounds more sweeter than the dome of Peter 
Flings o'er the Tiber paling solemnly. 
! 
the bells of Shandon sound far more grand on 
The pleasant waters of the river Lee. 
There's a 
bell in Moscow, while on tow'r and kiosk 0! 
In St Sophia the Turkman gets, 
And loud in air calls men to prayer 
From the tap'ring summit of tall minarets ; 
Such empty phantom I 
freely grant them ; 
But there's an anthem more dear to me, 
Ms 
the bells of Shandon that sound so grand on 
The pleasant waters of the river Lee.

In Jarsey, or in Spain; 
But none will care ., rom whence he came, 
When he's home with us again. 
Then shout and cheer, &e. 
He talks no more of Politics, 
He says he's had enough; 
To stand their capers and their tricks,

He thinks he'll start a

To greet us when we reach the door—

THE DAUGHTER OF CHARLOTTE TEMPLE. 
No one who has read the touching account of the 
misfortunes of Charlotte Temple, with that absorb-
ing interest which is inseparable, from INIro. Row-
son's writings, can rest satisfie4 while denying them-
selves a 
perusal cf the life of Charlotte Temple's 
Daughter, Lucy famplc. 
It is a 
sequel possessed of all the thrilling in-
terest that characterizes the life of the unfortunate 
mother, while it exemplifies in a 
wonderful manner 
" 
the -visitation of the sins of the parents upon the 
children." 
- 
It depicts sorrows that refuse the balm of sym-
pathy, and consolations which those around us 
" 
can neither give nor take away." 
It contrasts in 
living colors the richest fruits of virtue and happi-
ness on the one hand, and the bitter end, blighting 
disappointments and rail: resulting from once yield-
ing to the seductive influence of passion. 
It points a 
moral that commends it to the atten-
tion of all, and is pervaded by an interest that will 
hold the reader in ap attention to the end.

ENDORSEMENTS OF THE PRESS. 
The highest praise which can be given to this excellent 
elementat-y work on pracr ,cal inechl,tnics, consists in the fol-
lowing simple statement or facts : The e 
litor of this journal, 
while teaching natural philosophy and chemistry in the • 
Cooper lec4itute from 1869 to lb64, was in need of a 
text-
boo of practical in , 
chrvaie7=., adapted to the advanced classes 
who had beet: trained ia mathematics ; in his search among 
the many mechanical text-boelis, there was not one which so 
fully answered his requirem ,nts as the above work. 
It was 
therefare adopted and used with perfect satisfaction, and it 
is with pleasure that he receives it now as an old friend from 
the publishers, gives it his most ea-nest recommendation, 
and wishes it in the hands of all who are still in the fog about 
tbt4 units of work, calculation of the power of machinery, 
reiaistance to motion, strain on material, etc.-1/ailufackrer 
and Bulkier, July, 1874. 
.eirhe author of this work is well known as an extensive 
writer who has made some valuable additions to American 
technical literature, enumerated above in detail. 
The work 
we are now noticing is a 
theoretical treatise on practical me-
ebonies, designed to supply a 
recognized deficiency. 
Most 
of the works on mechanics treat the subject in a manner 
which is not available to young men commencing as appren-
tices in shops. 
Any young man with a 
fair kuowletig-e 
of 
arithmetic may, however, use this work to great advantage; 
it is not only suitable for a 
text-book, but also as a work 
of reference. 
Most ambitions young men will make them-
selves so familiar with its contents as to be able to refer 
readily to any portion of the book. 
The author has adopted 
a 
new notation to distinguish units of work from other units, 
"which is not without value, and might be advantageously 
introduced into more ambitious works. 
The book is well 
printed on good white paper, and bound in stifl.cloth covers.
