Toledoâ€”Latino 
San Marcos 
The San Marcos Supermercado and Restaurant (235 Broadway Ave., Toledo, OH 43604) 
is owned and run by a 
husband and wife, both originally from Mexico. The each 
immigrated as children: the husband working in the family grocery store and restaurant in 
Goshen, Indiana (his parents had run a 
grocery store in Mexico), and the wife's family as 
migrant workers initially in Florida. 
The establishment began primarily as an ethnic grocery and market, carrying items such 
as cooking implements, clothing, arts, crafts, religious candles, and celebration needs 
(pinatas) unique to the Hispanic community. Mainstream stores have recently begun 
including such "ethnic" items, oftentimes in a 
section marked as "Mexican" or 
"Hispanic," but many customers still frequent the store, not only for its large variety of 
offerings, but also for its welcoming, community atmosphere. 
The grocery now includes a 
large restaurant offering Mexican-style dishes. Mostly 
representing northern Mexican regional cuisine, this menu shares similarities with other 
"Mexican" restaurants, but those "in the know" recognize that it is distinctively Mexican 
rather than "Tex-Mex." Restaurant customers walk through the grocery in order to enter 
the restaurant, passing aisles of fresh produce, bakery items, and meats along with the 
packaged goods. As more "Americans" (non-Hispanic) become familiar with Mexican 
food, more customers come to the store asking for ingredients for specific dishes.
