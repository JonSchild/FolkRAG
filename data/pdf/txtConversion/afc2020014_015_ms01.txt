Introductions 
00:00:32 
Growing up, Kristyn says her family didn't necessarily have a 
deliberate culture 
around food. She can remember both of her parents cooking, and they always had 
a 
lot of meals cooked at home. When she was younger, her dad worked for a 
catering company at night. She remembers staying up until he got home from 
work and eating food together. 
Kristyn has a 
lot of food memories, because she really loved food as a 
kid. She 
always enjoyed eating. She says her parents did their best to make sure they were 
eating some form of vegetables and fruits. It was a 
combination of what they 
thought was healthy coupled with being thrifty. They didn't grow up with a 
lot 
of sugar and things like that around the house. They spent a 
lot of time at her 
grandparents' house, and her grandmother cooked a 
lot for them. She was 
fortunate to have a 
lot of meals where they ate together. 
00:02:24 
Kristyn's grandma let her and her uncle put in a 
big garden, and she remembers 
putting in a 
lot of time there and being fascinated with it. She also liked cooking 
food and learning about it. She's the oldest of her siblings, and sometimes if her 
parents weren't home, she would be tasked with putting something together. She 
was interested in food and agriculture growing up, but they didn't have a 
ton of 
access to larger-scale growing. Her parents told her that she liked spending time at 
her grandma's in the garden and in the kitchen. 
00:03:37 
Kristyn isn't sure how much those early memories and experiences with food 
impacted her decision to get into farming. A 
lot of Kristyn's favorite memories 
were being outdoors in nature. She grew up on Long Island, and most of her 
Kristyn Leach Interview Log, March 5, 2021

mom's siblings and Kristyn's grandparents ended up moving to upstate New York 
when she was in middle school. She has a 
lot of fond memories of going up there, 
learning to forage, and learning about different wild edible plants. It was always 
her comfort zone. She was pretty shy as a 
kid, and she liked spending a 
lot of time 
outdoors because it helped her feel grounded. She had a 
lot of positive 
associations and ease being outside and around plants. Her parents joke around 
and say that when Kristyn was a 
kid, she said she wanted to be a 
farmer. 
However, it wasn't necessarily clear growing up that things were going to go that 
way. 
00:05:15 
As an adolescent, Kristyn spent a 
lot of time getting involved with community 
gardens around New York. The 1990s was a 
very contentious time, but there were 
many vibrant community garden and art spaces. She was drawn to that through 
being into some of those young, anarchist spaces and being into punk rock, art, 
and things like that. She was introduced to different parts of that culture, and she 
was meeting adults who had a 
much stronger belief and analysis around the 
importance of land, growing your own food, and what that meant in the bigger 
scheme. 
The anti-globalization movement of the 1990s also informed a 
lot of Kristyn's 
thinking about what peasants were struggling with globally. She learned through 
that history and framework and saw Korean peasants organizing within that. 
Kristyn felt privately very proud of anything that was from Korea when she was 
younger, including every article of clothing or product in her house that said it 
was made in Korea. Learning about the intersection of agrarian and politicized 
movements and seeing Korea's strong voice within that peaked Kristyn's interest 
and instilled in her how integral land access and the ability to feed yourself and 
your community are. Everything else we think of in terms of our collective 
freedom rests on our ability to feed ourselves and our communities. From that 
more intellectual place, Kristyn started thinking about and wanting to learn to 
grow food. 
00:08:19 
At that age, Kristyn was very curious about her Korean identity, but it was also 
hard to look at in certain ways. There was one other Korean adoptee in the town 
where she grew up, and she felt uncomfortable with the expectation that they 
would be put together. She didn't have a 
ton of ways to connect to Korean 
community, let alone her own sense of Korean identity. She also just shied away 
from it in an external way. She didn't want it being brought up or to feel different 
in her surroundings. It was mostly something she processed internally. She could 
find that in the comfort of reading and learning about different things or finding 
news or other information regarding Korea.

When Kristyn was five or six, the Olympics were in Korea, and that felt like a 
big 
deal. She says she has gotten to see Korea transform from a 
military 
dictatorship to rise into its current economic situation. Although she was 
definitely interested in her identity, it wasn't something she was seeking in terms 
of connection with anyone else. She mostly tried to process it for herself and 
make sense of how many different feelings there were. 
00:10:40 
There were a 
lot of Asian Americans in the area where Kristyn was. She doesn't 
know how emotionally intelligent she was as an adolescent. She thinks she 
repressed a 
lot of feelings. It felt safe for her to engage with things from a 
politicized and more intellectual point of view, especially things she felt critical of 
and the different ways people experienced neoliberalism in the time she was 
learning about all of this. 
She had a 
lot of strong role models, and she feels lucky to have grown up when 
she did in those spaces. Growing up, there was an integral squatted art space she 
was part of, and one of the leaders there was an Asian American woman who was 
doing a 
lot of prison abolition work. At that time, Kristyn was learning many 
different things and becoming aware of the types of things that were driving 
people to do good work in the world. Everything at that time was blowing her 
mind. It was powerful to see Asian Americans organizing cross-culturally and 
organizing for bigger social movement causes. 
00:12:49 
Kristyn's father was a 
police officer all through her growing up, and pretty much 
every male figure she had in her life was related to the police, fire, or military 
fields. Becoming a 
teenage anarchist didn't elicit the best dinnertime 
conversation, but overall, Kristyn still had a 
lot of respect for the experiences of 
her family. Even though they definitely clashed, her parents were also too busy to 
really care or limit what she was doing. She was left to her own devices a 
lot of times and could spend her time doing what she wanted. 
It was tense, but looking back, it was pretty run-of-the-mill in terms of teenage 
rebellion and how that felt to her parents. For Kristyn, some of the tension was 
being in these spaces, coming from that background, and still having some 
amount of perspective of the lives of people who were in law enforcement and the 
military. As much as it was contentious, it also forced her to think about things 
with some complexity. She couldn't get too swept up in the pure rhetoric of it. 
00:15:05 
Kristyn moved to Washington state when she was nineteen or so. She lived in 
Olympia, and it's still probably the most incredible and beautiful place she has 
ever lived. The Olympic Peninsula is beautiful, and there is a 
ton of small-scale 
farming happening there. A 
lot of people Kristyn met were working on those 
farms or grew up in more rural areas, and through that, she got to learn by 
Kristyn Leach Interview Log, March 5, 2021 
3 
working on some small farms. She also had some close friends who lived on 
larger pieces of land, and she was able to experiment with growing things and 
learn from her peers. 
She lived there for seven years, and toward the end of that time, she started to take 
it a 
little bit more seriously. She realized that there had been a 
constant enjoyment 
of the actual work, and she liked physical labor and being outside. A 
lot of her 
time there was spent learning how to do things, and then toward the end, she felt 
like it was something that really stuck with her and that she was curious about. 
She thought that if she liked the actual labor part of it, she might enjoy 
learning about the science of it. 
In the last few years, she tried to learn whatever she could. There's a 
college in 
Olympia that has a 
sustainable agriculture program, and Kristyn worked with the 
manager of the student farm at another farm. She asked him what books she 
should read and about the things she should focus on and learn. Through the co-
op extension and public universities, Kristyn started going to free field days and 
any other free educational opportunity she could. Even if she didn't understand 
what they were talking about, she would take notes and then go to the library to 
research it on her own. She started going down that rabbit hole, and all of it was 
endlessly fascinating. 
She learned about soil and plant biology and botany, and instead of just being told 
how to do something, she started thinking about how things actually work. Once 
you start learning about the mechanisms that govern life on this planet, there's 
never going to be an end point for how much you can learn and take in. Once that 
door was open and Kristyn got really curious about it, her passion grew and she 
realized that it was what she wanted to be doing with her time. 
00:19:26 
When Kristyn went to Washington, she didn't go with the intention of farming. 
When she graduated from high school, she went to a 
technical trade school in 
New York and got her associate's degree in commercial illustration. However, she 
quickly realized that wasn't what she wanted to do. She had a 
friend moving to 
Olympia, and she felt ready for something different. Looking back, she can't 
really explain what drew her to the place, other than curiosity, wanting to be on 
the West Coast, and having the means to move. It feels fortuitous now, because 
her time there was quite impactful, and she feels very shaped by it. She says she 
grew up there in a 
way, and it was fundamental to a 
lot of how she sees things 
now. 
00:21:27 
Kristyn found the farms she worked on through different people she knew, and 
because there are a 
lot of farms there, there's a 
lot of opportunity to have odd jobs 
or volunteer at different places. She had a 
friend who started her own farm while 
Kristyn Leach Interview Log, March 5, 2021 
4 
Kristyn was there, so she got to see that process. She worked at a 
restaurant and 
music venue in downtown Olympia, and the owners had a 
small farm where she 
spent a 
lot of time. A 
lot of it wasn't super deliberate on her part. She didn't have 
a 
lot of clear direction. She was just fortunate enough to be in this community and 
was presented with these opportunities. 
When Kristyn moved to California, she had a 
clear picture in her head of what she 
wanted to learn and what skill sets she wanted to fill in. She still wasn't thinking 
she would necessarily have her own farm, but she understood more about what 
she felt interested in. Moving provided her with a 
big opportunity to be more 
intentional. Her time in the Northwest was a 
time of taking in new information 
and new experiences and being far from home for the first time. She felt more 
responsive to things that presented themselves and a 
lot less like she was 
controlling the rudder of the ship. She was guided more by curiosity and 
openness. 
00:23:41 
Kristyn recalls how she thought about her Korean adoptee identity while living in 
Washington. She remembers being there and hearing things like "person of color" 
for the first time. She wasn't quite sure what to make of it. At that time, coming to 
terms with things and processing her own identity was still pretty nascent. In 
addition to Tacoma and Seattle, there was a 
lot of Korean community in the 
town adjacent to Olympia. 
Where she grew up in New York, there was a 
lot of Korean American community 
as well, but it wasn't something she ventured out to see. In Washington, she felt a 
little bit more curious. She got loosely involved with a 
leftist Korean organization 
in Seattle, but since she didn't live up there, she wasn't a 
regular member. 
However, she did make a 
point to try and connect with that group or go to their 
different functions. 
Kristyn also became curious about different Korean foods and Korean crops. It 
was there that she started thinking her agricultural world and her love of food 
could be a 
means to explore her identity. Although it was still largely internal 
processing and learning on her own, it was racked with a 
lot of vulnerability. It 
was anxiety-ridden just to go to the Korean market and feel very scared about the 
types of interactions she would have there. Generally in those spaces, someone 
would read her as being Korean and speak to her in Korean. She still can't speak 
the language well, and she couldn't speak it at all then. Those moments, even 
when you get to interact with the culture, can sometimes feel very negative. 
00:27:06 
Kristyn felt somewhat emotionally repressed for a 
lot of time and then gradually 
felt more and more comfortable with exploring her identity. Finding pockets 
of Korean Americans who understood that the adoptee experience was a 
really 
Kristyn Leach Interview Log, March 5, 2021 
5 
quintessential part of the Korean American experience and contextualized it was 
important for Kristyn to feel safer and to feel welcomed. Having organizations or 
communities that actually held that idea and had it built into them validated 
Kristyn's experience and ran counter to her earlier experiences of not quite 
knowing how she fit into her view of Korean American culture. 
It was important for her to have supportive people and be curious. She realized 
there were so many plants that could bring her back to thinking about her 
grandma and the experiences she had at her house. Kristyn says there are things 
that become gateways for her to perpetually think of someone in some place in 
time that become enshrined in her memory. What if the dial gets turned back to 
look at longer expanses of histories or ways that aren't a 
direct memory of hers 
but a 
broader cultural memory of her people and the place she was born? 
Kristyn recognized the nostalgia that she had eating different things and what it 
would remind her of. Thinking that there might be some other more epigenetic 
imprint of different foods, she was curious about tasting them and wondered if it 
would not only stir something in her, but also let her connect with other Korean 
people. She had those skill sets and knew how to grow things, so she started 
growing her own Korean crops. 
It felt like a 
safety blanket, because she could bring these plants with her to some 
sort of Korean American function or event as an offering. It helped convey 
something about her and how, even if she doesn't know what it means to be 
Korean, she does want to think about what it means to keep their traditions and 
culture alive and to care for their collective heritage. It gave her some assurance 
and confidence, because she understood how she could contribute to that. It took 
it out of this esoteric realm of identity and put it into something practical. She 
knew how to do some sort of work that would be meaningful. 
00:31:27 
In Washington, Kristyn knew someone Chinese American who was involved with 
growing, but she wasn't necessarily growing anything culturally specific. There 
was also another Korean adoptee who worked at the same place, and they started 
connecting about things like that. 
When Kristyn moved to California, she first got involved with a 
farm that was 
related to a 
food justice organization in West Oakland. From there, she worked for 
a 
tomato breeder and then a 
commercial lettuce farm. None of that was really 
related to Asian American culture. She read David Masumoto's book Epitaph for 
a 
Peach and was very enamored with that. It was also very impactful to find and 
read through the Kitazawa Seed Company catalog. They started carrying Korean 
crops more recently in 2009 or 2010, but Kristyn remembers looking through the 
Kristyn Leach Interview Log, March 5, 2021 
6 
catalog and keeping track of everything that said it was Korean. It gave her a 
shortcut to see what the significant Korean crops were. 
There were things shaping Kristyn's perspective and letting her better understand 
the rich history of Asian American farmers and the different immigrant 
communities that have contributed to agriculture in this country, but it was 
from afar. There was no direct mentor around that. 
00:34:22 
Kristyn had lived in Washington for a 
while and she loved it, but her partner 
ended up getting into graduate school in California. Although Kristyn had applied 
to a 
farm manager job in Tennessee, it was easier for her to move to California 
and find work than for her partner to move to rural eastern Tennessee. 
There were plenty of things that Kristyn was curious about in California. Her love 
of different movement histories made her excited to live in the home of the Black 
Panthers and the United Farm Workers. She was also captivated by the food 
justice work happening around the Bay Area at that time. She says she didn't 
expect to be so settled in California. She thought of it as the next best move and 
where she could continue to learn and build, but that was in 2009. 
00:36:17 
Kristyn talks about what led her to think about starting her own farm. She was 
growing things as a 
side hustle, because she wanted to grow and understand 
different crops, such as kkaenmp and chamoe. She grew in a 
couple of different 
places, including her back yard and the side spaces at the farms she worked on. 
The Bay was the first place she lived that she saw a 
bigger food culture and 
conversations among young Asian American cooks coming up in leadership, 
starting their own projects, and wanting to incorporate their own heritage and new 
iterations of what California food is. It was the first time Kristyn saw this rich 
tapestry of Asian American people centering food as part of the conversation. That 
was when she first started thinking about having her own farm. 
She remembered having a 
conversation with someone she worked with in 
Washington about trying to sell things more direct to restaurants. There wasn't a 
huge culture of that there. In a 
lot of places, it was direct-to-consumer farmers 
markets and CSAs (Community Supported Agriculture). A 
lot of the restaurants 
were buying from bigger distributors. In the Bay, it blew her mind how many 
restaurants were shopping at the farmers market or buying direct and how farmers 
had rich relationships with different chefs and cooks. 
Kristyn worked in the kitchen at a 
restaurant called Camino. The chef there, Russ, 
was a 
chef at Chez Panisse, and he was their produce buyer. Kristyn moved in the 
fall and couldn't find full-time farm work, so she ended up getting a 
job there in 
Kristyn Leach Interview Log, March 5, 2021 
7 
the kitchen. Russ is half-Korean, which she didn't know at the time. She says she 
learned so much from his cooking and approach to food. 
Originally, before she was thinking about growing Korean crops, she tried to 
experiment with growing things she knew chefs would want to use or had less 
access to. She met amazing farmers through Russ, and she saw a 
lot of mentors 
doing things around heirlooms and biodiversity. That collided with her budding 
personal interest and side hustle of growing different Korean crops. It felt like the 
opportunity was present, because there were Asian American cooks she was 
meeting who were going on to do their own things. She had the assurance that if 
she grew it, she would have the market for it. It gave her confidence that having 
her own farm could be viable from a 
market perspective. It was because of the 
rich culture and conversation happening and still evolving in the Bay Area. 
00:40:55 
Kristyn knew she wanted to grow Korean crops, because she knew how enamored 
she was becoming with the plants. There are some crops that are so specifically 
linked with different cultures and communities, and there's something beautiful 
about plant domestication in general. It's a 
beautiful side of something that can 
become a 
devious thing at times. Kristyn also thinks about these long periods of 
history and the repeated selections made in regards to preference, flavor, and 
cosmetics. She likes how it offers her a 
glimpse into what Korean people have 
historically thought of as delicious or useful. Those preferences result in distinct 
cultivars of different crops like melons, perilla, or peppers. She knew she wanted 
to focus on that, because it's personally enriching, and it made sense in terms of 
building that community and feeling a 
desire to contribute to the growing 
understanding of Korean food in the U.S. 
Through Russ, Kristyn got to know a 
lot of food industry people, and there were a 
lot of Korean Americans doing great things in the kitchen. He ended up 
introducing her to the brothers that own Namu Restaurant, and that's still the 
partnership that informs her farm. 
00:43:10 
Kristyn talks about the process of starting her own farming business. She was 
working in Bolinas (California) at a 
long-standing farm growing mostly lettuce 
and salad greens. There, she started growing mostly perilla and unsuccessfully 
tried growing Korean melons. Someone mentioned that there were these guys 
who had a 
restaurant doing a 
take on California cuisine from a 
Korean American 
perspective. Kristyn had to work the farmers market every weekend, and she 
remembers bringing a 
small box of perilla with her for several weeks. She knew 
that the brothers from the restaurant shopped at the market she worked at. She 
brought a 
spritzer to keep the perilla fresh and had it in the back of the truck, but 
she never worked up the nerve to approach them. 
Kristyn Leach Interview Log, March 5, 2021

Finally one day when she was driving down to the Bay, she went to their 
restaurant, met one of the brothers, and dropped it off. They immediately 
connected because of that love of perilla. As soon as he opened the box and 
smelled what it was, it clicked. Kristyn says seeing him so excited about it was 
the best feeling for her. She started bringing them stuff each week. 
When she was going to move back to the Bay Area, she was returning to work for 
a 
farmer that she worked for before. In exchange for managing his farm, she was 
going to be able to use some space on it to start her own small side business. She 
had made connections with a 
handful of chefs around the Bay, and she thought 
about focusing on two or three crops and starting to build a 
market for them. 
Around that time, Namu wanted to contract her to grow Korean chili peppers. She 
agreed to do that, and then the opportunity came up to sublease a 
whole acre from 
her boss. Once that offer was on the table, Namu stepped in and agreed to pay for 
the cost of securing that lease plus associated costs. Kristyn could then grow all 
sorts of Korean crops for the restaurant. 
Having that opportunity through her old boss and having Namu invest in her 
enabled her to start up. They ended up putting about two thousand dollars into the 
project, and Kristyn grew food through that first season as a 
pilot to see what they 
thought. In the fall of that season, they said they wanted to enter into an 
agreement where Kristyn would grow some things exclusively for them, but they 
would have a 
partnership where the farm would grow all of these things in 
conversation with the owners and chefs at the restaurant. It evolved pretty quickly. 
Kristyn was going to take it a 
lot slower, experiment, and understand what crops 
she could grow well. Because the opportunity to start bigger came and was met 
with that financial investment, she tried to hit the ground running. 
00:48:59 
This year (202 1) is their tenth year in business. 
00:49:13 
The operation has evolved quite a 
bit since they first started. When Kristyn looks 
at old pictures of the farm, she can see how happy she is in all of them. Now, 
she's much more critical. In those first couple years, Kristyn says she was 
deliriously happy she was getting this opportunity, growing these things, and just 
having her own farm. Now, she's much more familiar with the crops, and in some 
ways, feels like she's doing a 
worse job than ever. Some of that is because they 
moved farms three years ago and encountered a 
lot of problems with restarting the 
farm. They left her well-established farm where all of the systems were in place 
and the soil was built up over seven years and had to start from square one. 
Kristyn's familiarity with the plants has increased, and she's so much more 
acutely attuned to any little bit of stress. She says she's way more stressed out 
now than she was before, but it's from having a 
more nuanced understanding and 
a 
lot more experience behind her. In the first few years, there was a 
level of 
Kristyn Leach Interview Log, March 5, 2021 
9 
naivete and exhaustion. Now, she has to navigate managing her own stress and 
critical eye. 
When Kristyn started growing, she was working for the person she was 
subleasing the land from. She wasn't getting paid from Namu, because she 
wanted to pay back their investment before they talked about any money things. 
Kristyn worked for the tomato farm from four-thirty in the morning to about two 
in the afternoon, and then she would do her farm with whatever daylight was left. 
That farmer ended up being pretty terrible to work for. They were getting paid in 
cash at the end of each day, and he stopped paying them at some point. Even now, 
he owes Kristyn about seven thousand dollars of wages from that year. 
Kristyn was in a 
precarious position, because she was on his land as a 
subtenant, 
and the owner didn't know she was there. Not having any savings when she 
started all of this, there were times when she was just trying to keep her head 
above water. She was trying to piece together other work, but he was leveraging 
the fact that she had so much planted and was committed to her project. She still 
ended up having to work for him even though he stopped paying her. He told her 
that if she stopped working for him, it would cancel their land agreement, and he 
could plow down her whole field with no consequences. 
Being so strapped and being physically exhausted that first year was hard. Kristyn 
worked for him five days, did her farm those five afternoons a 
week, worked for 
another farmer on the weekends doing markets, and worked Saturday through 
Monday nights on the line at Camino. Even though she was working a 
lot every 
single day, she probably still made under twenty-four thousand dollars for that 
whole year. It was a 
mess, but when she looks back on it, she can still see a 
feeling of being unfazed and having a 
lot of conviction. 
She worked multiple jobs for the first five years of the farm. She worked for the 
Korean mushroom farmer on the weekends and sometimes on random weekdays, 
filled in at the restaurant when she could, and worked a 
catering job through the 
winter. It's only in the last few years that she scaled up, added seed production, 
and was able to balance multiple jobs within her farm project. In the past few 
years, she has been able to do the farm full-time. 
00:55:01 
Kristyn talks about the seed production work they're doing on the farm now. 
Some of the seeds she started with were bought from Kitazawa, and some came 
from Korea. The Lee brothers from Namu have an aunt with a 
farm in Korea, and 
she sent a 
lot of seeds for things they wanted at the restaurant. 
That first year of farming, she was pretty isolated and learned a 
lot from the folks 
at Namu. Part of the agreement with them was to set aside some produce for 
Kristyn Leach Interview Log, March 5, 2021 
10 
donation or for something else that would benefit the Korean American 
community. They started donating produce to a 
Korean American domestic 
violence program. Through bringing produce there, Kristyn ended up meeting a 
lot more Korean American people. They hosted a 
big harvest festival on the farm 
at the end of their first year. They wanted to have a 
harvest celebration with 
traditional Korean drumming, because it's rooted in agricultural tradition. Kristyn 
and a 
friend both ended up getting in touch with the same Korean drumming 
group through two different friends, and they came out to the farm. 
Once the bigger Korean community found the farm, it seemed very much like 
they felt a 
claim to it. It came to be their own farm, and people began sharing 
seeds with Kristyn. In her area, there weren't any other commercial farms 
explicitly growing Korean varietals. A 
lot of people had seeds that were in their 
family or shared with them by different family members. It quickly became a 
hub 
where people channeled a 
lot of their own seed resources. 
Out of sheer necessity, Kristyn had to figure out how to incorporate seed saving 
onto the farm. This included thinking about how to keep everything well isolated 
and practical things about seed saving. From the beginning, it was also important 
to keep seed as a 
collective resource. Kristyn doesn't have the same nostalgia or 
sentimentality that a 
lot of other people have with these crops. From a 
scientific 
perspective, she realized every little decision she makes and every piece of 
implicit bias she has will inevitably shape these plant genetics, even in a 
short 
period of time. It made her feel accountable to having Korean American 
community involved at the farm. 
When Kristyn was figuring out what plants to save seeds from, she wanted to 
know what would safeguard the crop at a 
genetic level so that at the end of a 
decade of growing, it would still bring about that nostalgia when brought to 
Korean Americans. She wondered what keeps something tethered to those 
traditions while still adapting crops to the dry, intense conditions of the and West 
Coast. She was thinking about it from a 
climate chaos perspective and equipping 
these crops with the means to survive harsher conditions. Alongside that, she 
knew she wanted to always keep certain traits intact so that it would still be 
maintained as a 
Korean variety. 
Kristyn felt the opportunity and the burden of the trust that's placed in you when 
someone gives you a 
seed and tells you a 
story associated with it. That became 
very fundamental to the way her farm operated and something she always had to 
account for in her planning and crop planning, including how fast she could turn 
ground over and replant things. She had to account for the whole life cycle of 
every crop there so she would continue to have access to those seeds and be able 
to replenish them to their original providers. 
Kristyn Leach Interview Log, March 5, 2021

To Kristyn's benefit, she had a 
good amount of growing and farm work 
experience at that point. Even if she wasn't super familiar with having grown that 
specific crop or saving the seeds from it, she knew the fundamentals of the plant 
family, the plant's biology, and how to grow good quality seed. Community input 
would help her shape the selection index she was looking at. 
Kristyn went to Korea in 2014 to meet with the preservationists and people 
involved in traditional, natural farming. After that, she didn't anticipate having so 
many people share seeds with her, but in her travels there, people ended up giving 
her a 
ton of seeds to grow out here. It was either for Korean Americans who felt 
like their access to the fresh produce they wanted was limited, or for a 
lot of 
Korean farmers who felt the decline of food sovereignty for the peninsula and 
how it related to seed preservation. 
In all of these cases, whenever seed was being shared with her, there was some 
urgency in the imperative to grow it and continue to perpetuate those varieties. 
Kristyn's experience up to that point was mostly as a 
fresh market producer. She 
had been really interested in seed saving for a 
long time. She volunteered at a 
seed 
saving garden in Olympia, but none of the bigger farms she worked at saved their 
own seeds. Economically, it's not worthwhile in a 
lot of cases. On Kristyn's own 
farm, it felt like that became the cornerstone of how things operated. 
1:04:16 
Kristyn says there isn't a 
clear breakdown between the fresh market crops and 
those used for seed production. A 
lot of things have a 
dual purpose. About ten to 
twenty percent of the farm at any given time is dedicated to crops used explicitly 
for seed increase. No one is eating it or trying it. It's just to boost the seed 
population to a 
point where they could grow it for their regular production and 
have people eat it. 
They grow a 
number of heirloom soy on the farm, and it's just in the past three 
years that they've eaten it. They've grown it since 2015, and for the first several 
years, they started with ten beans of each variety. For the first couple of years, 
they were saving every single one for replanting and having to trust that they were 
delicious. Kristyn devoted a 
large amount of time and space to this crop, even 
though she had no idea what it tasted like. 
For other things, they're able to do both. Some stuff, like peppers, were the first 
crop that she grew for commercial seed sales. Kitazawa realized there was a 
lot of 
interest in Korean chili peppers, and Kristyn was doing trials for them. She 
says chili pepper is worthy of its own interview, because in Korea, it was the 
gateway to a 
lot of multinational investment in the agricultural sector. 
Kristyn Leach Interview Log, March 5, 2021

Kristyn brought an heirloom variety back from the region that's famous for 
gochujang production. It's a 
unique landrace stewarded by peasants there. She 
wanted to share that story and for there to be an open-pollinated variety. Farmers 
in Korea growing that pepper say it's hard, because they're contending with 
newer high-yielding, chemical-intensive pepper varieties. At this point, consumers 
are more familiar with that. Kristyn didn't want to replicate that trend here for 
Korean Americans, so they started selling those heirlooms through Kitazawa. 
Pepper is a 
great crop, because you grow it, dry the fresh red pepper, and harvest 
the seed. Kristyn can still use those as chili flakes or something else, so you're not 
necessarily sacrificing anything in order to successfully grow and replicate the 
seed. For other things, like perilla, it takes several months for the seed to mature 
after they stop harvesting the leaf. On a 
production farm, you're trying to account 
for that real estate and the time you leave that plant alone. They're not necessarily 
able to monetize that space through some sort of product. 
For a 
lot of fresh market farmers, it's harder to incorporate seed production. For 
example, you're harvesting a 
head of lettuce in forty-five to sixty days. It's high 
value, and there's constant demand for it. The margins for something like lettuce 
are great. To let that seed mature triples the time that crop is in your field, and 
with lettuce seed, it's a 
whole other process to harvest it. When you think about 
the pack of seed and how much that costs you in land, water, and time, a 
lot of 
people think it doesn't make sense economically. However, if you adapt varieties 
to your farming methods and are able to grow things with less inputs, you end up 
saving a 
lot of money. 
There's not a 
clear breakdown for Kristyn of what portion of the farm is devoted 
to seed, because they let all of their crops go to seed. Whether or not they sell the 
crop, they want all of the crops to be gaining knowledge year-to-year of how to 
survive in a 
drier and hotter climate. Everything on the farm goes through its full 
life cycle. Some of that has no bearing on how it affects the fresh market side, and 
some of it does. It is a 
juggling act to figure out how to budget for all of that, 
including what volume to grow of different things so that a 
long-season seed crop 
is subsidized by other things with better margins. 
1:11:19 
Kristyn talks about her trip to Korea. Before she moved to California, Kristyn had 
explored the idea of wanting to go to Korea and connect with the Korean Women 
Peasants Association (KWPA). At different times, she had had conversations with 
KWPA 
and Korea's chapter of La Via Campesina. The trip never came to fruition 
for one reason or another. In 2014, Kristyn had an acquaintance (Steve) who was 
living in Korea. The mushroom farmer Kristyn worked for pushed them to 
connect and for Kristyn to go to Korea while Steve lived there. Kristyn couldn't 
believe that this person she knew just through being a 
customer at the farmers 
Kristyn Leach Interview Log, March 5, 2021

market was so willing to take her on this journey. He was curious, too, because he 
had lived there for some time as a 
child. As a 
chef, he was spending an extended 
period of time there to learn traditional sauce making. Kristyn already knew she 
wanted to go to certain places, learn from farmers, and learn about seed 
preservation and traditional farming methods. Fortunately, it aligned with things 
that interested Steve. 
Steve was Kristyn's local fixer. Kristyn had various contacts and people she had 
arranged to stay with and visit, and with his knowledge of Korea, Steve created an 
itinerary. He peppered the trip with other things that were interesting to him from 
a 
food perspective. Kristyn, Steve, and a 
friend of Kristyn's from the U.S. spent 
three weeks traveling through Korea, staying on farms that Kristyn had been in 
contact with, and visiting different places along the way. Kristyn says it's all to 
Steve's credit that he took on a 
relative stranger and her friend and spent every 
waking moment of those three weeks with them. 
Kristyn remembers every day being so full. She was learning a 
lot of information, 
but it was also emotionally overwhelming. On one hand, it was a 
fascinating work 
trip where she was digesting so much content, meeting with so many interesting 
people, and hearing many interesting stories. At the same time, it was her first 
time going back to Korea since she was a 
baby and was adopted. It was a 
confluence of all of these really intense things happening. Only four or five days 
into the trip, she recalls feeling overwhelmed and exhausted. She didn't know 
how she was going to make it through the rest of the trip with so much to 
process. 
A 
lot of the focus was on learning from the folks doing seed preservation. The 
whole experience was one of feeling more Korean than she ever had and also so 
un-Korean. The starkness of feeling her Americanness and what that means to 
people in Korea was blatant, especially going to places like Jeju Island to meet 
with a 
farmers association at the forefront of trying to prevent the building of a 
U.S. naval base there. All of this was part of the Pacific pivot and many decades 
of fortifying different parts of East Asia in the scheme of U.S. militarism. Kristyn 
met the head of the farming association when she was on tour here speaking about 
peasant organizing against the naval base. She and Kristyn really connected about 
being farmers, so she vouched for them. 
However, Kristyn says it didn't matter there that she's Korean American, or that 
she was born in Korea. To them, Kristyn was American, and her country was 
destroying their landscape and livelihood. The dust from the construction of the 
naval base was coating their tangerines and destroying the coral reefs along the 
shoreline of the island. It's making them a 
pawn in this big, global imperial 
Kristyn Leach Interview Log, March 5, 2021 
14 
scheme, and it's going to subject their neighborhood to the impact of what it 
means to have U.S. soldiers deployed there. 
Kristyn felt like she could walk around Korea and be in the countryside, and she 
looked like your average uncle farmer. She very much fit in. She had asked a 
friend if gender stuff would be a 
little bit weird. She thought she might be misread 
a 
lot. Her friend told her that it would be weird, but what would be weirder is how 
tan she is and how much she looks like a 
peasant. That's class stuff, and that 
would be the bigger issue. 
It was an interesting experience of walking around and feeling like that is how she 
was read. She looked like a 
country bumpkin buying a 
six-pack of beer or a 
coffee 
at a 
corner store. For the first time ever, Kristyn felt very integrated and that she 
didn't stand out. She also didn't feel vigilant in the way she does in the U.S. about 
how she's being read. At the same time, when there was more depth to 
interactions, she felt like her experience was not that of a 
Korean. It was so 
distinctly American. Koreans don't necessarily even care if it's Korean American. 
It's just American, especially when they are communities impacted by U.S. 
foreign policy. 
It was the most incredible and most draining experience Kristyn had ever had. A 
lot of the seed preservationists she met were fascinated by the fact that, as a 
Korean American, she really wanted to learn about native crops and old varietals. 
A 
lot of the things that have been legitimized by the West are the modernized 
version of Korea. Kristyn's curiosity was interesting for them. She got into some 
interesting conversations with seed preservationists about who is interested in 
heirlooms within Korea. 
She says there is definitely a 
larger push from young, urban folks wanting to 
return to rural areas as they recognize this conversation about food and food 
sovereignty. A 
lot of the seed people she talked to were trying to hold the tension 
of relatively inexperienced, idealistic urban-based folks wanting to take up that 
mantle and more experienced rural folks, peasants, and small-scale farmers 
having to band together to make that viable. Economically, heirlooms don't have 
the novelty they do in the U.S. 
In some ways, earning people's trust was a 
big part of that trip. Getting to work on 
people's farms was Kristyn's comfort zone, and it was a 
way for them to see that 
she actually knew what she was doing. So much of Kristyn's gratitude is for 
having found this work and for it being the way for her to connect to things. It 
ended up being the shared language that cut through all of those other divisions 
and helped bond her with people. Seeing her as a 
farmer surfaced as the most 
important part and allowed them to connect across all of these other things. 
Kristyn Leach Interview Log, March 5, 2021

On the rice farm she stayed at, she was threshing soy beans, working the ground 
with a 
basic hoe to plant cover crops, and returning dried perilla to the fields. 
Doing all of those things was the first time she could feel herself able to dig 
deeply and feel very grounded. She was in the comfort of plants that she was 
super familiar with, even if she wasn't familiar with everything else happening 
around her. For other farmers to see that familiarity and ease and that she could do 
the work and had done it before made them feel more ease with her. 
At one agricultural research station, they clearly only trusted Kristyn because they 
touched her hands and felt that she had done a 
significant amount of manual labor 
in her life. At first glance and talking to her, Kristyn could see the skepticism in 
their eyes. After four grown men touched her hands at once, there was a 
complete 
tone shift. They wanted to go to the seed vault, talk about different things, walk 
through the fields. It was remarkable to have that experience. 
Kristyn stayed at a 
hostel in Seoul that's explicitly for adoptees. She went to rural 
areas and stayed for days at a 
time, but she always reconvened at this hostel called 
KoRoot. She met all different people there as she came in and out, and every 
person there was doing some form of a 
birth family search. They would talk over 
meals about where they were at with their process. Kristyn says hearing 
everyone's stories was so intensely vulnerable, and then when it was her turn, she 
revealed that she wasn't looking for her birth family at all, but instead was 
collecting seeds and talking to farmers. 
People thought that was the weirdest thing ever, but Kristyn says she was doing 
exactly what they were doing, just in the way that made sense to her. She 
recognized that she probably wasn't going to do that traditional birth family 
search, but she was searching in the exact same way. In some ways, it has given 
her more permission to hold the parts that are hard or that she's processing as an 
adoptee. She also feels she can mesh herself within an experience of being 
Korean, being born in Korea, or being Korean in her lineage. 
Having all of this about adoption still in conversation while she was in Korea, she 
felt lucky she wasn't trying to wade through murky bureaucracy and opaque 
information. She was talking to a 
bunch of farmers and trying to figure out how to 
smuggle a 
bunch of seeds back into her country. 
1:27:18 
Kristyn says there's so much advice to give to farmers, but there's also so much 
advice that needs to be given to so many to impact the fate of farmers. People 
who own land, the vast majority of whom are white, need to know something 
about what it means for farmers to thrive. Consumers need to know what 
conditions will help support BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, people of color) farmers 
so they're able to have their own businesses. 
Kristyn Leach Interview Log, March 5, 2021 
16 
From a 
mentoring perspective, there are a 
lot of practical things to talk about and 
information to share on how to run a 
farm business. There are plenty of times 
when Kristyn thinks it would be easier to find a 
good, well-established farm and 
go back to being someone else's farm manager, but the community connections 
are what make that impossible. There's a 
relevance to why it feels worthwhile to 
be a 
small business person, which is a 
very different thing than just getting to be a 
farmer. If you have that sense of relevance and importance and reasons for why 
you think you need to do it, then everything else will fall into place. So many of 
the BIPOC farmers Kristyn knows who want to have their own farms are 
motivated by wanting to feed the people that are important to them. They want to 
see our different stories reflected in the bigger story of agriculture. 
Kristyn says it's hard to give advice, because she feels very blessed in a 
certain 
way. Even just hearing herself talk about different things in this interview, she 
knows she has had incredibly good fortune. She has happened into beautiful 
communities where she has gotten to learn a 
lot. There's always been some wind 
at her back. Although it's not like she's worry-free, she has had incredibly good 
fortune with people and with things being driven from the heart. She's not sure 
she can just advise others to surround themselves with especially good people. In 
particular, these are people that will support your farm beyond just the things they 
take from being fed by it. 
Kristyn doesn't know that there's any sort of advice to give, because she doesn't 
feel like she conjured all of this or that it's due to her own devices. In a 
lot of 
ways, she fell into good favor. As much as is possible, think about how farming 
shapes your accountability to the land and the communities that live there. If you 
think about farming as a 
series of relationships and how that shapes how you 
operate in the world, then all of the toil and challenges will be minimized. 
Farming is always stressful. It's stressful every single day. However, you'll 
constantly be aware of the beauty that's present around you; you'll be 
intellectually stimulated; you'll always have things to learn; you'll feel grounded 
in a 
bigger narrative of purpose and place. As a 
member of an ecosystem, you 
gain an understanding that it is comprised of millions of dynamic interactions that 
grow and amplify and find different ways of relating to each other. The humility 
that being a 
farmer prompts is something that feels personally substantive, and it's 
the most spiritually grounding thing to feel your own smallness within all of this. 
As much as is possible, foster each one's own curiosity and appreciation for how 
we get to have some role in it. 
1:34:03 
Although Kristyn is connected to older Korean community in her area and some 
have farming history backgrounds, she isn't connected to some of the older 
Kristyn Leach Interview Log, March 5, 2021 
17 
Korean farming community. Farmers and non-farmers alike can relate to the 
differences in experiences between first-generation immigrants and second-
generation, adoptees, and people holding a 
dual experience in the U.S. In some 
ways, there's an existential angst in a 
lot of the stories that surround her farm 
about identity and heritage. She doesn't know how older generations find that 
when they were driven by very different reasons to grow Korean crops or have 
farming careers in this country. 
The experience in the movie Minari is not Kristyn's experience. She has unique 
experiences with the people she does know who have farmed, and it's been mostly 
supportive. There might be people that roll their eyes, don't relate to it, or are 
perplexed that the conversation is ripe now compared to when they were trying to 
have farms in the 1980s and 1990s. 
With the mushroom farmer Kristyn worked for, Kristyn could see both 
mentalities. She seemed both bemused and entertained that someone like Kristyn 
has the opportunities she does, but she was also appreciative. That farmer has 
three daughters. None of them are farmers, and she's very pleased with that. They 
all went on to be doctors, lawyers, and things like that. Kristyn can still see a 
kernel light up in her about Kristyn's choice to grow Korean crops and bring 
them to her, but she would never express that directly to Kristyn. Although she 
was resistant to accepting the produce Kristyn brought her every week, Kristyn 
would overhear her making positive comments to customers about Kristyn and 
her produce. She also expressed terror about not understanding how people would 
pay so much for organic produce. 
Despite feeling perplexed, there were enough moments where she could concede 
she was very pleased that someone of Kristyn's generation still cared about these 
things. It's a 
mixed blessing to have kids that more successfully integrated into an 
American career, because she also lamented that her daughters don't care about 
this. 
Kristyn can apply these experiences in the bigger sphere of how people think 
about what someone like her is doing. She doesn't hear the negative parts of it, 
because the people who approach her resonate with some part of it. Through this 
mushroom farmer, Kristyn can see confusion, pride, anxiety about her future, 
interest in some of the heirlooms, and little sparks of happiness, even if it's 
competing with the pressures she has obviously felt as an immigrant. 
Some Korean Americans who are second-generation on their family farm might 
not want to be pigeon-holed in the same way. There's part of the Korean 
experience that wants people to stop making them be Korean. They might not 
Kristyn Leach Interview Log, March 5, 2021 
18 
want to grow Korean produce, but instead grow things from all over the world 
because they have the opportunity to. 
Kristyn always wants her experience to feel like this is the way she chose to 
do it. She's happy when it's something Koreans and Korean Americans 
respond to, but she doesn't want her experience to be presented as a 
monolith 
of what all Korean people should do or aspire to, or as the only way they can 
be successful.
