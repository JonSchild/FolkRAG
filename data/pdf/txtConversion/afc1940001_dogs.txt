said to me. " I don't know much about this pedigree.It is easy to tell a female from the restFor a
female has gotta lot of little buttons down her vest. " Da-da-da-da.A boy and a girl in the woods did
play,Saw a big black bear a-coming their way.The boy in fright up a tree did climb,The girl through
the woods with the bear behind.A man named Mr. [Yeun?] ?  [?] ? was blind all his life;Has seventeen
children all by the same wife.Why have you so many children? I said, Mr. Yeun,? He said, I was blind
and couldn't see what I was doing.A girl from the city went out to milk the cow;She thought she'd
try, but she didn't know how.A farmer came out, said, you've made a mistake,That cow that you're
milking, his name is Jake.A sailor went into a restaurant in haste.The waitress had an American flag
wrapped around her waist.The sailor looked up, said with a jag,Many a [ good? ?] battle has been
