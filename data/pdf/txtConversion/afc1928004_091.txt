DRIVEN FROM HOME. 
(The Music of this song is published by J. L. rETER8,599Broathray, 
New York. Price 40 Cents.] 
Out in this cold world, out in the street, 
Asking a penny of each one 1 
meet, 
Shoeless I 
wander about, thro' the day, 
Wearing my young life in sorrow away. 
No one to help me, no one to love, 
No one to pity me, none to caress— 
* 
Fatherless, motherless, sadly I 
roam; 
A child of misfortune, I'm driven from home. 
CHORUS. 
No one to help me, no one to bless, 
No one to pity me, none to caress; 
Fatherless, motherless, sadly I 
roam, 
Nursed by my poverty, driven from home. 
The flowers that bloomed, that I 
loved to see, 
Seem bowing their heads as if pitying me; 
The music that mingles with voices of mirth, 
From the windows of pleasure and plenty on earth, 
Makes Inc think what it is to be friendless and poor— 
And I 
feel I 
shall faint when I 
knock at the door; 
Turn a 
deaf ear, there's no one will come 
To help a 
poor wanderer driven from borne. 
No one to help me, &c. 
Oh! where shall I 
go, or what can I 
do 
I've no one to tell me what course to pursue: 
I'm weary and footsore, I'm hungry and weak, 
I 
know not what shelter to night I 
may seek. 
The Friend of all friends, who rules earth and sea, 
Will look with a 
pitying eye upon me ; 
I'll wander about, till IIis messenger conies 
To lead me to father and mother at borne. 
No one to help me, & a

Washington Street, Boston, Price 4J cents. 
Oh ! birdie, I 
am tired now, 
I 
do not care to hear you sing ; 
You've sung your happy songs all day, 
Now put your head beneath your wing; 
I'm sleepy, too, as I 
can be— 
And, sister, when my prayer is said, 
I 
want to lay me down to rest, 
So, put me in my little bed. 
CHORUS. 
Come, sister, come kiss me Good-night 
For, I 
my evening prayer have said, 
I'm tired now, and sleepy too, 
Come, put me in my little bed.

sister ! what did mother say, 
When she was called to heaven away ? 
She told me always to be good, 
And never, never go astray; 
I 
can't forget the day she died— 
She placed her hand upon my head, 
She whispered softly : " Keep my child—" 
And then they told me she was dead! 
Come, sister, arc. 
Dear sister come and hear my prayer, 
Now, ere I 
lay me down to sleep, 
Within my heavenly Father's care, 
While angels bright their vigils keep, 
And let me ask of him above, 
To keep my soul in paths of right— 
Oh! let me thank him for his love, 
Ere I 
shall Lay my last Good-night. 
Come sister, Aro

Washington Street, Boston, Price 40 cents. 
In her" litt'e bed" we laid her, 
When the roses lost their bloom, 
.And a 
valley-grave we made her, 
Close beside her mother's lonely tomb; 
Little birdie sang his sad notes, 
As her spirit passed away, 
:Ere she sought the home of angels, 
In the land of perfect day. 
CHORUS. 
Little birdie sing your sweetest, 
For, darling is an angel now, 
She is free from pain and sorrow, 
With love's star upon her heavenly brow. 
Far too lovely was our darling, 
For this cold and bitter life, - 
And although we weep to miss her, 
She is free from mortal worldly strife; 
And we dream her angel mother, 
Strokes again her darling's head, 
And, amid angelic music, 
Lays her in her little bed. 
Little birdie, (le. 
Little birdie, sing your sweetest, 
Darling is an angel now, 
She is free from p.tin and sorrow, 
With love's star upon her heavenly brow; 
Happy child and happy mother, 
Reunited ne'er to part, 
In the angel home above us, 
Let this cheer our mournful heart.

THE /CAMEL WALTZ. 
As Sung by TONT PANTOS. 
I 
once did know a 
pretty girl, 
She dressed so very neat; 
She used to run a 
sewing-machine, 
Down in Chatham Street. 
Her eyes were bright, complexion light, 
Her cheeks were like the rose; 
She'd a 
dimpled chin, and pouting lips, 
And a 
beautiful turn-up nose. 
I 
never can forget the night 
I 
met her at a 
ball: 
'Twas a 
fancy hop, a 
dollar a 
head, 
Up at Irving Hall. 
CHORUS. 
She looked so neat, I 
never thought she eTer would prove false; 
Meg Atop was light as the bounding fawn, dancing the Mabe". 
Walt. 
I 
often met her after that, 
Of tender things we talked; 
And, every Sunday out of two, 
I'd take her out to walk. 
I 
bought her lots of diamonds, 
At a-dollar-jewelry store, 
And also bought her a 
new silk-dress, 
Which every day she wore. 
In buying presents for that girl, 
I 
all my money spent, 
Until I 
found myself dead broke, 
And. I 
hadn't got a 
cent. 
[ex:10mm 
And, then, I 
thought 'twas getting tine 
Mao question for to pop. 
I 
went one day dressed in my best, 
Straight down to the shop: 
She didn't come; I 
asked the cause, 
And learned from one Miss Brown 
Aly charmer had, that very day, 
Just gone out of town. 
Judge my feelings when Miss Brown 
These cruel words let slip: 
It's my opinion she s 
gone off 
Upon her wedding trip.

year had passed away, 
At a 
window I 
did see

And, there, what met my view I

THE BEAUTIFUL HIGHLANDS. 
SCOTCH SONG HY MRS. HOWARD PAUL. 
Hurrah for the Highlands, the stern Scottish Highlands, 
The home of the clansmen, the bold and the free; 
"Where the clouds love to rest on the mountain's rough breast 
Ere they journey afar o'er the depths of the sea._ 
'Tis there where the cataract sings to the breeze, 
As it dashes in foam, like a 
spirit of light; 
'Tis there the bold fisherman bounds o'er the sea, 
in his fleet tiny bark through the perilous night. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah for the Highlands, the stern Scottish Highlands, 
The home of the clansmen, the bold and the free; 
Where the clouds love to rest on the mountain's rough breast, 
Ere they journey afar o'er the islandless sea. 
'Tis the land of deep shadow, of sunshine and shower, 
Where the hurricane revels in madness on high ; 
For there it has might that can war with its power, 
In the Wild dizzy cliffs that are cleaving the sky. 
I 
have trod merry England and dwelt on its charms, 
I've wandered through Erin, the gem of the sea; 
But the highlands alone the true Scottish heart warms, 
Her heather is blooming, her eagles are free. 
Then hurrah for tho Highlands, &o.

DASHING BELLE. 
I'm a 
dashing Belle so gay, 
Who 
flirts her time away; 
To pease young men, I 
promise them. 
To be their wife sonic day. 
I 
love to tease them so, 
When to parties and halls I 
go; 
Or take a 
walk to have some talk, 
It is so nice you know.

And admire our pretty feet; 
For all day long t

With me you'll all agree: 
For grace and elegance of style,

Or sonic handsome fellow court ; 
To break his heart with Cupid's dart,

WILLIAM TELL. 
When William Tell was doom'd to die 
Or hit the mark upon his infant's head, 
The bell tell'd out, the hour was nigh, 
And soldiers march'd with grief and dread 
The warrior came, serene and mild, 
Gaz'd all around with dauntless look, 
Till his fond boy unconscious smil'd ; 
Then nature and the father spoke. 
And now, each valiant Swiss his grief partakes. 
For they sigh, 
And wildly cry, 
Poor William Tell I 
once hero of the lakes. 
Bur soon is heard the muffled drum, 
And straight the pointed arrow flies, 
The trembling boy expects his doom, 
All, all shriek out--" he dies ! he dies!" 
'When lo I 
the lofty trumpet sounds 
The mark is hit ! the child is free! 
Into his father's arms he bouirds, 
• 
Inspir'd by love and liberty ! 
And now each valiant Swiss their joy partakes, 
For mountains ring, 
Whilst they sing, 
Live William Tell ! the hero of the lakes.

WANDERING WILLIE. 
Here awa, there awa, wandering Willie, 
here awa, there awa, baud away hame; 
Come to my bosom, my am n 
only dearie, 
Tell me thou bringest me my Willie the same. 
Winter winds blew loud and cauld at our parting, 
Fears for my Willie brought tears to me e'e, 
'Welcome now summer, and welcome my Willie, 
The summer to nature, my Willie to me. 
Rest, ye wild storms, in the cave of your slumbers, 
now your dread howling a 
lover alarms ! 
Waken, ye breezes ! row gently, ye billows ! 
And waft my dear laddie ance niair to my arms, 
But, oh, if he's faithless, and minds nae his Nannie,

WILL WATCH. 
rwas morn, when the wind from the northward blew keenly, 
While sullenly roar'd the big waves of the main, 
A famed smuggler, Will Watch, kiss'd. his Sue, then serenely 
Took helm, and to sea boldly steer'd out again ; 
Will had promised his Sue, that this trip, if well ended, 
Should coil up his hopes, and he'd anchor on shore. 
When his pockets were lined, why his life should be mended 
The laws he had broken he'd never break more. 
His sea-boat was trim, made her port, took her lain, 
Then Will stood for home, reach'd the offing and cried, 
This night, if I've luck, furls the saits of my trading, 
In dock I 
can lie, and a 
fri,.nd serve beside; 
Will lay-to, till night came on darksome and dreary, 
To crowd every sail then he piped up each hand, 
But a 
signal soon spied, ' twas a 
prospect uncheery, . 
A signal that warn'd him to bear from the land. 
The Philistines are out, cries Will, we'll take no heed on't, 
Attack'd, who's the man that will flinch from his gun ? 
Should my head be blown off, I 
Audi ue'er feel the Feed on't 
Well fight while we c, ii ; when we can't, boys. 
run ; 
Through the haze of the night a 
bright flash now appearing, 
Oh ! now, cries Will Watch, the Phi11 ,tines bear down, 
Bear- a-hand, my tigl,t lads, ere we think about sheering, 
One broadsiae pour in, should w 
c 
swim, boys, or drown. 
But should I 
be popp'd off, you, my mates, left behind me, 
Regard my last wor,s, ree 'cm kindly otcyed 
Let no stone mark the spot, and, my friends, do you mind me, 
Near the beach is tie., grave where Wilt Watch would be laid; 
Poor Will's larn was spun out—for a 
bullet next minute 
Laid Mtn low on the deck, and he never spoke more. 
His bold crew fought the brig while a 
shot remained in it, 
Then slieer'd—and Will's lull to his Susan they bore. 
• 
In the dead of the night his last wish w,- s 
complied with, 
To few known his grave. and to few known his end, 
He was borne to the earth by the crew that he died with, 
He'd the tears of his Susan. the prayers of each frond ; 
Near his grave dash the 
s, the winds loudly bellow, 
Yon ash struck with lightnit.!.., ( tints out the ho d

Where Will Watch. the bolsi smuggler, that famed lawless 
fellow, 
Once feared, now forgot, sleeps in peace with the dead.

Of all past, dangers made a joke; 
For still his manly hosom burn'd 
With love—his heart was heart of oak. 
His strength restor'd, Tom nobly ran 
To cheer his Nan, his destin'd bride ; 
But false report had brought to Nan, 
Six months before, that Tom had died. 
With grief she daily pin'd away, 
No remedy her life could save; 
And Torn return'd—the very day 
They laid his Nancy in the grave. 
I HAVE A SILENT SORROW HERE 
I 
have a 
silent, sorrow here, 
A 
grief 
ne'er impart; 
It breathes no sigh, it sheds no tear, 
But it consumes my heart. 
This eherish'd woe, this loved despair, 
My lot for ever be; 
So, my soul's lord, the pangs I 
bear 
Be never known by thee, 
And when pale characters of death 
Shall mark this alter'd cheek; 
When my poor wasted trembling breath 
My life's last hope would speak: 
I 
shall not raise my eyes to heaven, 
Nor mercy ask for me; 
11 v 
soul despairs to be forgiven, 
Unpardon'd, love, by thee,

Yes, I 
will leave my father's halls 
To roam along with thee ; 
Adieu, adieu, my native walls, 
To other scenes I

Yes, we will seek the silent glade, 
When we have stray'd afar, 
And you shall play, my dearest maid, 
Songs on your light guitar. 
Love, gentle love, shall be our guide 
To a 
far distant land, 
And whether bliss or wo betide, 
This heart you shall command. 
I'll tell you tales of olden years— 
Of hapless love or war ; 
But !dtould they cause you pearly tears,

At the Balance step my hat it fell,

ALLEN- A- DALE. 
Allen-a-Dale has no fagot for burning, 
Allen-a- Dale has no furrow for turning, 
Allen-a-Dale has no fleece for the spinning, 
Yet Allen- a-Dale has red gold for the winning, 
Come, read me my riddle! come, hearken my tale, 
And tell me the craft of bold Allen-a-Dale. 
The Baron of Ravensworth prances in pride, 
And he views his domains upon Arkindale side, 
The mere for his net, and the land for his game, 
The chase for the wild, and the park for the tame, 
Yet the fish of the lake, and the deer of the vale-, 
Are less free to Lord Dacre than Allen-a-Dale. 
Allen-a-Dale was ne'er belied a 
knight, 
Though his spear be as sharp, and his blade be as bright 
Allen-a-Dale is no baron or lord, 
Yet twenty bold yeomen will draw at his word; 
And the best of our nobles his bonnet will vail, 
Who at Rere-
cross or Stanmore meets Allen-a-Dale. 
Allen-a-rale to his wooing is come, 
The mother she ask'd of his hout.e and his home, 
Though the castle of Richmond stands fair on the bill, 
My hall, quoth bold Allen, stands gallanter still, 
"Us the blue vaulted heaven, with its crescent s) pale, 
And with all its bright spangles—said Allen-a-Dale. 
The father was steel and the mother was stone, 
They lifted the latch, and they bade him begone ;

THE BONNY BOAT. 
Oh swiftly glides the bonny boat, 
Just parted from the shore, 
And to the fisher's chorus note, 
Soft moves the dipphor oar ; 
Their toils are borne with happy cheer, 
And ever may they speed, 
That feeble age, and helpmate dear. 
And tender bairnies feed. 
CHORUS. 
We cast our lines in Largo bay, 
Our nets are floating wide, 
Our bonny boat with yielding sway 
Rocks lightly on the tide; 
And happy proves its daily lot, 
Upon the summer sea, 
And blest on land our kindly cot, 
Where all our treasures be. 
The mermaid on her rock may 
The witch may weave her charm, 
But water sprite nor eldrich thing 
The bonoy boat can harm ; 
It safely bears its scaly store 
Through many a 
stormy gale, 
While joyful shouts rise from the shore, 
Its homeward prow to hail, 
We east our lines in Largo bay, a:c

Prove, ere you deny me, 
If you cast me off you blast me, never more to rise :

BRUCE'S 
ADDRESS. 
Scots, wha hae wi' Wallace bled 
Scots, \N. ham Blame has atter' led I 
'Welcome to your gory bed, 
Or to glorious victory ! 
Now's the day, and now's the hour 
See the front of battle lower ! 
See approach proud Edward's power 
Edward I

Nita will be a 
traitor knave? 
Wha would fill a 
coward's grave ? 
Wha sae base as be a 
slave ? 
Traitor ! coward ! turn and flee. 
Whit for Scotland's king and law 
Freedom's sword will strongly draw, 
Freeman stand, or freeman fa' ? 
Caledonian ! on wr me I 
By oppression's woes and pains I 
By your sons in servile chains ! 
We will drain our dearest veins, 
But they shall be, shall be free 
Lay the proud usurpers low I 
Tyrants fall in every foe 
Liberty's in every blow 
Forward ! let us do, or die ! 
THE VOICE OF HER I 
LOVE. 
How sweet at close of silent eve, 
The harp's responsive sound'; 
How sweet the vows that ne'er deceive, 
And deeds by virtue crown'd ! 
How sweet to sit beneath a 
tree, 
In some delighful grove; 
But oh ! more soft, more sweet to me 
The voice of her I 
love. 
Whene'er she joins the village train, 
10 hail the new-born day, 
Mellifluous notes compose each strain, 
Which zephyrs waft away. 
The frowns of fate I'll calmly bear, 
In humble sphere to move ; 
Content and bless'd whene'er I 
hear, 
The voice of her I 
love. 
BREAK IT GENTLY TO MY MOTHER. 
See ere the sun sinks behind those hills, 
Ere darkness the earth doth cover, 
You will lay me low in the cold damp ground, 
Break it gently to my mother, 
I 
see her sweet sad face on me now 
And a 
smile doth o'er it hover, 
0 could I 
but spare the tears that will flow, 
Break it gently to my mother. 
CHORUS. Good-bye, my mother ever dear, 
Sister, you loved your brother; 
Comrades, I 
take a 
last farewell, 
Break it gently to my mother. 
Oh say that in battle I've nobly died 
For right and our couutay's honor, 
Thickly around fell our enemy's shafts 
Yet saved was our starry banner. 
My sister, playmate of boyhood's years, 
Will lament her fallen brother, 
She must try to soothe a 
parent's woe. 
Break it gently to my mother. 
Good-bye my mother, drc,

THE CARRIER PIGEON. 
Come hither, thou beautiful rover, 
Thou wanderer of earth and of air; 
Who bearest the sighs of the lover, 
And bringest him news of his fair ; 
Bend hither thy light waving pinion, 
And show me the gloss of thy neck ; 
A perch on my hand, dearest minion, 
And turn up thy bright eye and peck. 
Here is bread of the whitest and sweetest, 
And there is a 
sip of red wine 
Though thy wing is the lightest find fleetest, 
'Twill be fleeter, when nerved by the vine; 
I 
have written on ro,e-scented paper, 
With thy wing-quill a 
soft billet-doux, 
I 
have melted the wax in love's taper, 
'Tis the color of true hearts, sky-blue. 
I 
have fasten'd it under thy pinion, 
With a 
blue ribbon round thy soft neck; 
So go ( rota me, beautiful minion, 
While the pure ether shows not a 
speck. 
Like a 
cloud in the dim distance fleeting, 
Like an arrow he hurries away ; 
And farther and farther retreating, 
He is lost in the clear blue of day.

There is a 
charm I 
can't explain 
About a 
girl I've seen, 
And my heart beaiis fast when she goes 
In a 
dark dress trimmed with green. 
Her eyes are bright as evening stars, 
So lovely and so shy, 
And the folks all stop and look around 
Whenever she goes by. 
CHORUS.

And I 
feel just as happy as a 
big Sun-Sower 
That nods and bends in the breezes, 
And my heart is as light as the wind that blowy 
The leaves from off the treeses. 
As time passed on and we became 
Like friends of olden time, 
I 
thought the question I 
would pop 
And ask her to be mine. 
But the answer I 
received next day, 
flow could she treat me so, 
For instead of being mine for life, 
She simply answered No I 
And I 
feel,A% 
I 
called next day dressed in my best, 
My fair one for to see, 
And asked her if she would explain 
Why she had jilted me. 
She said she really felt quite sad, 
To cause me such distress, 
And when I 
said, now do be mine, 
Why of °sum sheanswered, yes. 
And I 
feel, Zee.

Friends were fonder, joys were nearer, 
But, alas ! they've lied away ! 
Oh ! ' twas when the moonlight. playing 
On the valley's silent grove, 
Told the blissful hour for straying,

SHE LITTLE WITCH.—{CONCLUDED.] 
To you, sir, who look sad and glum over there, 
Believe me you've nothing to fear, 
l'aint heart never won any lady so fair, 
She loves you, so pray persevere; 
Forget and forgive, if she's flirting a 
while, 
She doesn't mean harm, I 
know well, 
Very soon on your suit the fair lady will smile, 
So listen to little witch Nell. 
CLIORUS.—I'm a 
witch, &e. 
Young gentleman, there, I 
can guess why you sigh, 
It's for whiskers—just list what I 
say; 
You shall have a 
magnificent crop by-and-by, 
But Rome wasn't built in a 
day. 
And you, sir, perhaps, may be troubled for cash, 
But all will come right I 
can tell; 
'Then keep up your pecker and don't be rash, 
But listen to little witch Nell. 
Cnoaus.—I'm a 
witch, &c. 
I 
see a 
young lady not far from the spot, 
If a 
man—she's the girl I 
should choose 
And of lovers she has such a 
terrible lot 
She doesn't know which to refuse. 
She will marry, of course, and on pincushions read, 
More times than I'm going to tell; 
Welcome, dear little stranger 
ah, welcome, indeed. 
How clever at witchcraft is Nell. 
CHOR,IIS.—I'm a 
witch, &c. 
I'm practised in witchcraft, which craft you may know, 
Can banish eaeh sorrow and gloom; 
I 
give you my blessing, dear friends, ere I 
go, 
And fly to IV gch street on my broom. 
Then look in to-morrow, more spells I 
will cause, 
And sorrow I'll try to dispel ; 
I 
only ask now for your hearty applause, 
For I 
am the little witch Nell.

CATIMLO 
It was on one Summer's evening, 
In the merry month of June; 
I 
beheld a 
damsel sitting 
'Mid flowers' sweet perfume. 
She had a 
novel, reading, 
Just as I 
was passing by, 
And as she turned another ',Age, 
I 
saw the brightest eye; 
A bewitching smile was on her face. 
As charming as the posies; 
I 
felt the smart of Cupid's dart: 
'Twas love among the roses. 
cuouus.—Now, I 
hate to tell, but then I 
must; 
Within her heart I 
place my trust; 
She was sitting in the garden, 
Where the little butterfly reposes; 
And how we met, I'll ne'er forget, 
'Twas love among the roses. 
I 
passed her house next evening, 
The clock had just struck eight, 
And I 
saw my future happiness; 
She was standing by the garden-gate. 
She smiled as I 
approached her, 
And I 
begged her to excuse; 
May I 
view those pretty flowers ? 
She murmured: If you choose. 
I 
spoke about the violets, 
Then finally made proposes; 
Thro' the garden we walked, of happiness talked; 
'Twas love among the roses. 
Now, I 
hate to tell, (cm 
I 
confess I 
love Matilda; 
Matilda, that's her name; 
And there is a 
charm about her, 
Which I 
never can explain. 
She dresses up to fashion, 
To her style there is no end, 
And, of course, she must look dashing; 
For, she wears a 
Grecian Bend. 
But she's left her home, and where she's gone, 
Most every one supposes; 
For, as dear as life is my little wife; 
'Twas love among the roses. 
Now, I 
hate to tell, dm.

THE MOUNTAIN MAID. 
The mountain maid from her bower has hied, 
And sped to the glassy river's side, 
Where the radiant moon shone clear and bright, 
And the willows waved in the silver light ; 
On a 
mossy bank lay a 
shepherd swain, 
He woke his pipe to a 
tuneful strain, 
And so blithely gay were the notes he play'd, 
That he charm'd the ear of the mountain maid. 
She stopp'0, with timid fear oppress'd, 
While a 
soft sigh swells her gentle breast, 
lb caught the glance and marled her sigh, 
And triumph laughed in his sparkling eye. 
So soft and sweet was his tuneful ditty, 
He charm'd her tender soul to pity, 
And so blithely gay were the notes he play'd, 
That he gain'd the heart of the mountain maid.

0 NEVER FALL IN LOVE. 
Fall not in love, dear girls, beware, 
Oh never fall in love! 
Better lead apes—you know where, 
Than ever fall in love. 
For men, their ends to gain, 
Are cruel when most kind, 
Their tears are false as rain, 
Their vows are only wind; 
And if von say them No, 
They swear their hearts are broke, 
Yet when half dead with woe, 
How nice and plump they look. [Fall not in love_ ,.k;e 
For if a 
rake you wed, 
For better tind for worse, 
When honey-moons are fled, 
Oh ! how he'll squeeze your purse, 
And if you scold at night, 
Quite easy by the by, 
Your husband grown polite, 
Yawns most melodiously. [ Fall not in love, & e

SWISS HUNTER'S WELCOME HOME, 
While the hunter o'er the mountain, at daybreak is bounding 
By the wild rilly fountain, the chamois descries ; 
Through the mist of the morning, his halloo resounaing, 
Every fear nobly scorning, still onward he flies. 
When the hunter o'er the mountain, 
At daybreak is bounding, 
By the wild rilly fountain, 
The chamois descries, the chamois, ecc. 
tricks in the snow-print, the flight of the ranger ; 
lie brushes the dew-tint, where cataracts foam; 
I, hunter pursuing, surmounts every danger, 
The swift chase renewing, till night calls him home. 
When the hunter o'er the mout.tain, 
At daybreak is bounding, 
in search of the chamois, 
Unwearied he flies, unwekried he flies. 
From the toils of the chase, the bold hunter returning, 
With joy views his cot in the valley below. 
When the hunter o'er the mountain, from the chase is returning 
To his cot near the fountain, with rapture he flies, 
Then content in his cottage, 
While gently reposing, 
From woman's bright smile 
Meets a 
sweet welcome home, a 
sweet welcome home.

l!if.Y EARLY LOVB 
My early love ! I'll think on thee, 
When eve in 
ek s its crimson throne, 
Sw eet hour! which gentle memory, 
Delights to eensrerate her own ; 
! 
then thy eiterish'd image clings, 
To all I 
no:et, or hear, or see, 
And twilight s 
breeze, like music, brings, 
Thy voice of gladness back to me. 
Friendship's young bloom may pass away, 
As dreams deittrt the sleeper's mind ; 
The hopes of life's maturer day, 
May file, and leave no trace behind. 
But early love can never die, 
That fairest bud of spring's bright years 
'Twill still bok green in memory, 
When time all other feeling sears.

Now let me alone, though I 
how you won't, 
I 
know you won't, I 
know you won't ; 
Let me alone, thou oh 1 
know you wtn't, 
Impudent Barney O'llea. 
It makes me outrageous, when you're so contagious, 
And you'd better b 
ok out for the stout Conley Creagh: 
For he is the boy that believes I'm his joy. 
So, you'd better behave vont sell, Berney °Ilea; 
Impudent Barney, none of your blarney. 
Impudent Barney O'Hea. 
I 
hope you're not going to Brandon fair, 
To Brandon fir, to Brandon fair ; 
For, indeed, I'm not wanting to meet you there, 
Impudent Barney 0'1 Iea. 
For, Corney's at Cork, and my brother's at work, 
And my mother sits spinning, at hume. all the day, 
So, no one will be there of poor me to take care, 
So, I 
hope you won't follow me, Bar. ey 
Iinpudent Barney, none of your blarney, 
Impudent Barney () Ilea. 
But as I 
was walking up Brandon street, 
Up Brandon street, up Brandon street, 
Just who do you think that myself should meet, 
But impudent Barney ° Ilea. 
Tie said I 
looh•d killin' : I 
called him a 
villain. 
And bid him, that minute, get out of my way ! 
Ile said ; I 
was joking ; and grinned so provoking, 
I 
couldn't help laughing at Barney 011ea ; 
Impudent Barney, he has the blarney, 
Impudent Barney O'llea. 
lie knew ' twas all right when he saw me smile, 
lie saw inc smile, he saw me smile ; 
For, ho is the roue tip to ey'ry wi'e, 
lupudent Barney O'Hea ; 
He coaxed me to choose him : for, If I'd refuse him, 
lie swore he'd Lib Corney, the very next day, 
So, for fear 'twould pm further, and justo save murther, 
think I 
must marry that mad-cap O'Hea ; 
Bothering Barney, he has the blarney. 
To make a 
girl Mistress 011ea.

THE STORM. 
Cease, rude Berens, blustering railer, 
List ye landsmen all to me, 
Messmates, hear a 
brother sailor, 
Sing the dangers of the sea; 
From the bounding bil!ows first in motion 
When the distant whirlwinds rise, 
To the tempest-troubled ocean, 
Where the seas contend with skies. 
Hark! the boatswain hoarsely bawling_ 
By topsail sheets and haulyards stand— 
Down topgallants quick b. hauling, 
Down your staysails, hand, boys, handl 
Now it freshens, set the braces, 
Now the topsail sheets let go— 
Loft', boys, luff. don't mtike wry faces— 
To your topsails nimbly clew. 
Now all you at home in safety, 
Shelter'd from the bawling storm, 
Tasting joys by heaven vouchsafed:ye, 
Of our state vain notions form ; 
Round us roars the tempest louder, 
Think what fear our minds enthralls, 
Harder yet, it yet blows harder,— 
Now again the boatswain calls! 
The topsail yards point to the wind, boys 
See all clear to reef each course,— 
Let the faresheet go—don't mind, boys, 
Though the weather should be worse ; 
Fore and aft the spritsail yard get— 
Reef the mizen—see all clear— 
Hands up, each preventer brace set,— 
Man the foreyard—cheer, lads, cheer 
Now the dreadful thunder roaring, 
Peal on peal, contending, clash, 
On our heads fierce rain falls pouring, 
In our eyes blue lightnings flash ; 
[1] 
THE STORM. [ CONCLUDED. 
One wide water all around us, 
above us one black sky, 
Different deaths at once surround us— 
Hark ! what means that dreadful cry ? 
The foremast's gone ! cries every tongue out, 
O'er the lee, twelve feet ' hove deck, 
A leak beneath the chest-trees sprung out,— 
Gall all hands to clear the wreck ; 
Quick the lanyards cut to pieces— 
Come, my hearts, be stout and bold, 
Plumb the well—the leak increases— 
Four feet water in the hold. 
While o'er the ship wild waves are beating, 
We for wives or children mourn, 
Alas ! from hence there's no retreating, 
Alas! to them there's no return 
Still the leak is gaining on us, 
Both chain pumps are choked below, 
Heaven have mercy here upon us, 
For only that can save us 110W. 
O'er the lee-beam is the land, boys— 
Let the guns o'erboard be thrown— 
To the pump conic, every- hand, boys— 
See our mizenmast is gone; 
The leak we've found, it can't pour fast, 
We've lighten'd her a 
foot or more, 
Up and rig a 
jury-foremast— 
She rights !—she rights! boys—wear off shore 
Now, once more, peace round us beaming, 
Since kind heaven has saved our lives, 
From our eyes joy's tears are streaming, 
For our children and our wives ; 
Grateful heats now beat in wonder, 
To him who thus trolono-s our days-
Hush'd to rest the mighty- thunder, 
Every voice bursts forth in praise.

POOR JACK; 
Go patter to lubbers and swabs, do ye see, 
'Bout danger and fear and the like, 
A tight-water-Loat and good sea-room give me, 
And ' tan't to a 
little Pll strike. 
r, mite. 
Tnough the tempest, top-gallant masts smack sunx)the shoud 
And shiver each splinter of wood, 
Lie ir the wreck, stow the yards, and house every thing tight, 
And un'ter reefed foresail we'll scud. 
Avast1 nor dont think me a 
milk-sop so soft, 
To be taken for trifles a-back, 
For they say there's a 
Providence sits up aloft, 
To Lek p 
watch for the life of poor Jack. 
Why, I 
heard the good chaplain palaver one day, 
Al) (Mt souls, heaven, mercy, and such, 
And, my timbers! what lingo he'd coil and belay, 
Why 'twas just all as one as hivh Dutch ; 
But he said how a 
sparrow can't founder, d'ye see, 
Without orders that comes down below, 
And many fine things that prcved clearly to MO, 
'!'hat Providence takes us in tow : 
For says he, do 
ou mind me, la storms e'er so oft, 
'Falco the top- lifts ef sailors a-back, 
There's a 
sweet little cherub sits perched up aloft, 
To keep watch for the life of poor Jack. 
I 
said to our Poll, for you see she would cry, 
When last we weighed anchor for sea, 
-What arguefies snivling and piping your eye, 
Why, what a 
damn'd fool you must be ; 
Can't you see the world's wide, and there's room for us all, 
Both for seamen and lubbers ashore, 
And if to old Davy I 
go, my dear Poll 
Why vou tier, r 
will bear of me more ; 
What then, alrs a 
hazard, come, don't be so soft, 
Perhaps I 
may laughing come bock, 
For d 
ye see. there's a 
cherub sits smiling aloft, 
To keep watch for the life of poor Jack. 
D've mind me, a 
sailor should be every inch, 
All as one as a 
piece of the ship, 
And w th her brave the world without offering to flinch, 
From the moment the anchor's a- trip. 
As to me, in all weathers, all times, tides, and ends, 
Notieht s 
a 
trouble 1: cm duty that springs: 
Mv heert is my Poll's, and my rhino my friends, 
knd as for my life, ' tis the king's: 
Even when my time comes, ne'er believe me so soft, 
with grief to be taken a-back, 
The same little cherub that sits up a-loft 
Will look out a 
good berth for poor Jack.
