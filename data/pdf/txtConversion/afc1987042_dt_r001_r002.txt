D:  One, two three, four, there we go.  Now we're rolling, O.K.  Can you hear me speaking now?
E:  Ah, ha.  
D:  O.K.  That sounds O.K.  
E:  That's a direct.  That's not a, is that on tape too?  
D:  Yeah, this is a stereo machine.  And this is the, that particular one.  So that sounds all right.  I 
don't know what's wrong with that other one.  I'll have to play with it again.  
E:  Well first of all is this the same machine?  
D:  No.  I just set that one down there.
E:  But I mean, but I mean is it the same machine thing?  Because you had this (--)
D:  Basically the same yes.
E:  You had this, you had this, was plugged in over here.  
D:  Yeah, it's ah, different design.  But it's the same company.  Any way.
E:  In any case.    
D:  Um, I just wanted to say again that it's September 18, 1987 and I'm speaking with Ed Harley 
in his office in the National Park Service Library on Merrimack Street in Lowell.  And I'm here 
to ask Ed about ah, his knowledge of the local canals and rivers.  I wanted to start I guess by 
asking you what your earliest recollections were of the waterways here in Lowell when you were
a young fellow.  
E:  Well, probably the earliest that anybody from Lowell would remember is just that every 
where you went you were crossing a bridge or going over a canal because the city is divided up 
into a group of islands because of the canal system.  So that your always aware of the canals 
being there although the importance of the canals or the reasons for them were oh, something 
that didn't come for quite a bit, until quite a bit later.  Probably the second thing that you'd notice 
about them would be seeing them used for swimming.  Ah, for example as a very small child 
when I'd visit my grandmother in Centraville and see the children swimming as I crossed the 
Central Bridge looking down seeing the children swimming in the river.  That impressed me 
greatly.  Ah, later on seeing them swim in the canals, which in later years I did swim.  I, all of us 
then swam in canals.  And the river was used for swimming both, by children both supervised 
and unsupervised.  The Merrimack River had several bathhouses over a period of years in 
different locations.  The main one being where it still remains now.  Along the Merrimack river 
at Pawtucket Boulevard.  Ah, that would usually be attended by city payed lifeguards or 
instructor in swimming.  The canals were always of course illegal but, it was very rare that ah, 
the swimming was interrupted.  Usually it would be because of somebodies complaint about 
nudeness.  I mean when kids swam in a canal ah, it was usually in the nude.  Unless you were 
going off the bridges in the main streets like at Swamp Locks from Armour's roof.  Your in down
town practically so of course suits were called for  [sirens in background, stopping just outside 
building] Ah, the areas that the swimming (--)  
D:  That's O.K.  
E:  The areas that the swimming ah, it might be O.K.  but who's on fire?  
D:  Yeah.  [Ed goes to the window and says," It's a false alarm across the street."
E:  Um, the river as I said had the municipal bathhouse on Pawtucket Boulevard.  There were 
other swimming holes at the ah, on Bridge Street.  Ah, on both sides of the river at first street and
in front of the Boott Mills.  And at one time years and years ago there were bathhouses there.  At 
least I found reference to a woman's bath house ah, on the river on the First Street side.  Um, the 
ah, further up the river ah, or further down river I should say, there was a spot that was used 
around Aiken Street.  Under the Aiken Street Bridge.  The Concord River has several well known
swimming places.  Ah, in the city itself opposite Charles Street off Lawrence was one that I 
remember.  There was a trestle bridge there that ran from ah, from Church Street to the New E, to
the ah, Lowell Electric Light Company Plant.  And ah, that was used as a ah, place to dive from 
and to sit and smoke a cigarette afterwards.  And a homemade ladder would be made just of slats 
pounded into the trestles themselves so that you could climb up and down.  This trestle was used 
at the time by ah, switching engines ah, once in a while.  And ah, I can recall people trying to ah, 
run ah, run the ah, ties rather than throw a cigarette away and finally having to jump off cause the
engineer madly tooted the whistle in fact there were [words just fade away, sentence not 
complete.] The ah, the other um, trestle bridges that were used also as I said was down by 
Armour's in the Pawtucket Canal at Swamp Locks.  One of the big ones in the Concord River 
was the six arched bridge which is a railroad bridge concrete on one side and trestle on the other. 
And ah, that was widely used ah, and still I think is a widely used swimming hole.  Slightly 
above that on the Concord River was a place with a small sandy beach called Indian Rock.  Um, 
in, on 3-A in Billerica at the Concord River there's a bridge that you would take if your heading 
to Boston that way.  And ah, that was always a recognized swimming hole that was an allowable 
swimming hole.  It was legal so to speak.  Um, the canals as I say were always off limits but, 
were all used.  The Lawrence Street Canal which is not part of the main canal system in Lowell 
ah, is where I swam mostly.  Other areas were at the Guard Locks, what was called Canal Field 
as I said several times now the ah, Armour's area at Swamp Locks.  Um, and there were other 
areas too that we used.  Any place where you could get in or out with some sort of ease.  Or 
make a ladder to get in or out was used.  
D:  But your saying there actually a law prohibiting swimming?
E:  Well, certainly.  First of all you have to understand that this is swift current.  I mean the 
number of deaths attributed to to swimming in these days that I'm speaking of in the twenties and
thirties were very high.  Ah, Locks and Canals naturally didn't want you in their water.  The 
proprietor of Locks and Canals.  Ah, there was no supervision which is, under any any conditions
when children are using it, or even adults, there should be somebody there who has some 
responsibility.  This was missing of course.  So that all in all it was illegal and ah, the police 
when called ah, would respond and chase you.  And if they found your clothes would take them 
and throw them out near the street so you had to in your, [interviewer is laughing at story] during
your skinny dipping had to make a mad dash to get your cloths and get out ah, before you were 
spotted by too many people.  Some of whom might have known your parents.  And ah, but, this 
is, this is prevalent ah today I'm sure still.  I don't see as much of it as I used to because there are 
so many other areas of recreation open that were not there in the ah, early and mid-thirties and 
before that.  Ah, the canals were there.  I really, the names that were applied to the canals were 
not the actual names of the canals, but the names that had been given to them sort of as 
nicknames of a person.  And er, until I worked for the National Park I didn't ah, realize the true 
names of many of the canals.  I also never really knew why a canal created power.  I knew it 
went in the mill and I knew that something happened in there and that we had power.  And it was
like turning the switch on in your lights.  I mean I'd throw a switch a light comes on.  Who the 
hell cares what happens.  And it works you know.  And ah, this is true of most of the people in 
Lowell.  And I know today many of the older people still don't know the actual names of them.  
These include people who worked in the mills that were operated by that ran, that were powered 
by the canals.  Ah, a lot of accidents, a lot of accidents, a lot of deaths.  Ah, and also in the winter
of course ah, the canals couldn't be used for skating because the current was such that you 
couldn't get a good ice cap.  Ah, they would freeze over at times but, this ice would ah, sort of 
float.  And would not adhere to the sides.  And, I've seen ah, you know kids playing on the ice 
and perhaps skating but once again this is where a lot of deaths would, would occur.  
D:  You mentioned a moment ago nickname for the, the canals.
E:  Well, where I swam mostly, we called the Lawrence Street Canal.  The actual name was the 
Wamesit Canal ah, the ah, Western Canal was always called the Suffolk Canal.  Ah, for good 
reason.  It ran down Suffolk Street.  It ran into the Suffolk-Tremont Mill complexes.  Ah, the 
Eastern Canal I called the Boott Canal.  I, and I'm not sure that these were the names, that Boott 
was the name given by all people to it.  But I don't recall ever hearing of the Eastern Canal, 
really.  Ah, when I was younger, and even say twenty years ago.  So, I'm not sure that that was a, 
a well known ah, designation for the Eastern Canal.  
D:  Ah, ha.  I think the first day that I met you here.  When Doug brought me around and 
introduced me to you ah, you were telling me about learning to swim in the canal yourself.  Now 
what was that like?  
E:  Well it's one of the, one of the ah, desirable points.  If there were such a thing, was that the 
current would take you ah, swiftly enough so that if you made any motions you were going to get
some ah, some distance.  And although it was unsupervised ah, officially there were older boys 
around who watched in a manner of speaking and ah, in the canal that I swam in ah, it was, there 
were three designations of bridges.  The first, second and third bridge.  The first and third bridge 
actually existed.  The second bridge was the area where there had been a bridge.  Ah, there was 
none there but because the bridge had been there the abutment ah, foundations ah, made a place 
that you could climb out of.  So it was considered part of the ah, one of, one of the three areas 
that you would go into and come out of.  I mean you could go in anywhere but you had to find 
one of these three spots to come out.  The Lawrence Canal unlike the ah, canals belonging to the 
ah, proprietors of Locks and Canals would just usually close power down on the weekend.  And 
so that on a Saturday or Sunday you could see how far your process, your progress had ah, 
proceeded by seeing how far you could swim with no current hoping that each week you'd gain a
little.  Ah, in the other canals power was not usually shut down completely every weekend.  Ah, 
some weekends they would be drained.  Quite often in that time they would be drained so that 
you wouldn't be able to swim ah, at all during some of the weekends.  The canals would just be 
drained down and ah, repairs made to the walls or debris that was stopping perhaps the current 
from producing the right head would be removed, and for a variety of reasons.  But ah, at other 
times if they were trying to conserve water they would shut the canal ah, the power off and let 
the ah, let the dam build up to a bigger ponding.  
D:  How old were you when you started swimming in there?  
E:  Ah, probably ten or eleven.  
D:  Ah ha.
E:  Probably ten or eleven when I first got caught too.  
D:  [laugh].
E:  And ah, but ah, it was severe punishment by my family, by anybody's family.  But you still 
went back.  It was something that ah, I had gone in there as early as March because some idiot 
said you know, let's go in.  And he went in.  And when he went in everybody had to go in.  And 
it's you know, freeze to death, or if you come home sneezing nobody was quite sure why you had
a cold.  You sort of knew.  It's just hard to describe to anyone [unclear] the canals were there.  
They were there and they were used.  And in addition to the canals there was other things too.  
The brooks were used for swimming.  Ah, Hale's Brook down at the South End in the Flats there 
was there was a swimming hole called Lucky's.  Just before it went into the ah, into the Bunting 
Mill Complex.  And er, this is the type of thing that was dammed by children, and cleaned out by
children.  They created a small dam of rocks.  Working themselves and building it up to get a 
pond and ah, and ah, then cheered on lustily by all the female workers as they swam under the 
windows in the nude.  And ah, it did a lot for building the ego of the boys that were swimming.  
[interviewer is laughing] But I think the girls were, the women were just sort of putting them on 
a little.  [laugh]
D:  Were there other swimming holes that had names like Lucky's?  
E:  Yeah, almost all of them had ah, further up Hale's Brook there was the, the um, the reds was 
one ah, another area up there was called I think the Chief or something of that nature.  These 
were a little further.  These were a little exotic for me because I didn't get up there.  These were 
nearer ah, the Brewery or the Poor Farm on Chelmsford Street.  And ah, these were more marshy
areas where for some reason small ponds existed in them.  And ah, also the chance of 
Bloodsuckers was greater up that area than they were.  The brook at that point was not as swift as
it would become later on down stream.  And so that you had more of a metal type of pond.  And 
because of this you'd have better chance of picking up something like a Bloodsucker.  Ah, 
another great place to swim in those days was in a portion of the old Middlesex Canal in North 
Billerica.  And er, it had a great sandy beach, was wildly used by families and I went back after 
the war and no one was swimming there and I didn't understand why.  And I went in and when I 
came out I understood why.  Because I had ten or twelve leaches on me at the time.  So that that 
was one of the reasons that had ah, lost favor I guess.  And I have not seen it in years but it is still
there.  Ah, what the beach is like now I don't know.  I, it, it could be that it's been cleaned up and 
is used again or just over grown.  And I don't even know if there is access to it anymore.  But it 
was very  close to the Talbot Mills in North Billerica.  Ah, that was strictly, simply called the 
Middlesex Canal.  The area of the Merrimack River that was supervised was called the Bath 
House.  Just simply The Bath House ah, but all of them would have a name of some sort a 
designation wether it was the Dizzy Bridge which might have gone for two or three different 
ones but, since you had a sort of territory that you ah, spent most of your time in ah, if it was 
your Dizzy Bridge it was The Dizzy Bridge.  If somebody spoke of the Dizzy Bridge you would 
think of the one that you were familiar with.  
D:  What was your home address at that time?
E:  At that time I lived in, on Crosby Street in Lowell which is in the South End.  Ah, the Flats 
section of the South End.  
D:  When I was in chatting with you the other day you were telling me about water ways serving 
as boundaries for neighborhoods.  
E:  Well, Hale's Brook for example and ah, would be a boundary between the South End and the 
Grove section of Lowell.  The South End and the Lower Highlands at another end of it.  Um, it 
could probably create a boundary between Ayer City in the Highlands.  Ah, most of the 
neighborhoods would have some sort of a natural boundary wether it would be ah, a stream or 
although it probably shouldn't be called a natural boundary a street or something that was ah, 
large enough and wide enough that you could say it interrupted ah, the neighborhood like 
atmosphere of a, for example a highway, a railroad track something of that nature.  And in the 
case of Hale's Brook it did that for those three areas.  The Ayer City ah, South End ah, The 
Highlands er, and the Grove.  They would, they could use that or, I would think it would be 
[unclear] although there, you couldn't say that you'd follow the brook and be following the 
border because there were times when the brook would be the border between say the Grove and 
the South End.  But as you come up it the Grove would cut down deeper beyond the brook.  
What I'm thinking of now is that the South End was probably if you follow the brook from 
Lawrence Street up to Prince Macaroni.  That would be a natural boundary between the South 
end and the Grove.  But, then the Prince Macaroni which was originally the Bleachery would 
become the boundaries so that the brook is removed from the further, from the southern most 
boundary by having this mill which is on the other, on the, on the Grove side (--)
D:  Right.
E:  Ah, and not being considered I cer, I would think part of the Grove would be part of the 
boundary itself as it went up, or the Bleachery in it's day would become part of the boundary.  So
that you've left the brook and pushed the boundary back a little further perhaps.  And then as the 
brook crosses ah, Gorham Street it still would perhaps be considered a boundary.  But if not then 
certainly well, it would.  That would be the boundary there.  From there on that would be the 
boundary of ah, the South End probably and the Highlands.  As it went down Howard Street and 
ah, swung then up Plain Street.  And running up Plain Street past the Chelmsford Hospital ah, 
well I'll take it back.  That doesn't touch close enough to Ayer City to be a division but, the 
division of Ayer City would have to be considered Plain Street itself I think.  The Harvard 
Brewery and ah, the cemeteries perhaps would cut it off.
D:  Um, we were talking about swimming and things that were done mostly in the warmer part 
of the year.  Were there any activities ah, during the colder months ah, on the canals.
E:  No, as I say, not so much on the canals.  The river would have a lot of skating.  The brooks 
would have a lot of skating on them.  Ah, but basically the canals weren't safe for skating.  Ah, 
that probably wasn't the biggest stopper.  The ice just wasn't good.  And ah, because as I say the 
current would go out.  So you'd always have it a, a couple of inches between the water and the 
ice which, which might catch up at times.  But because of the current flowing it would, it would 
not just, so you'd get a cover and it could build up but, at the sides of the canal on the canal 
banks, not on the banks but on the walls, canal walls the ice would not adhere.  If it adhered over 
the weekend when it was allowed to stop when the current started again then that ice would pull 
away.  So what you had was a floating, rocking thing that was not really solid ice.  Ah, the river 
above the dam would freeze.  And once again over the years, every year, year after year not only 
children but adults would be walking making a short cut ah, from Pawtucket Street to Pawtucket 
Boulevard and would go through the ice somewhere.  Quite often at night ah, when nobody was 
around to see it or hear it.  Just somebody didn't show up and ah, the bodies would be found ah 
down stream sometimes in the spring, sometimes before that.  Ah, but, in the main you would 
find some ice skating there.  You would certainly find it ah, on Hale's Brook in many places.  I'm 
sure Beaver Brook in many places.  Although, I'm not familiar with any of the areas that would 
do it.  Ah, in an effort to stop this the city themselves would take playgrounds and build banks 
around it and flood it with hoses.  The fire department would come down and flood it to create a 
safer and ah, atmosphere and ah, for the kids.  And they were widely used but, you know.  Like 
an apple in an orchard that's given to you when it's stolen there's something sweeter about getting
over the fence and stealing it.  And because of this there was a great deal of skating that went on 
in places where you know sensible people which kids are not would ah, would want to use.  
D:  People that would take cars or in the old days horses? Sleighs or anything out on the river?
E:  We'd do it at lakes.  Lake Muscupic or what was called Lakeview usually.  Cars still go out 
there for ice fishing to some degree.  Ah, teams would be on the river for cutting ice.  It was a 
very large ice house on the Merrimack River above the Falls.  And ice cutting there was a well 
known occupation before my time but I mean my father and uncles would talk about it and there 
are many pictures showing the large elevator that would take the ice up and deposit it down into 
the sawdust vaults that were below and ah, that would be sold through the summer taken out of 
these places.  And it's, I've read accounts in the older newspapers of the horses going through 
once in a while for one reason or another.  So the ice was cut both by hand by people and also by 
circular saw type things that were pulled by horse teams.  Ah, driving cars on the ice is not 
something that was done a hell of a lot in my day.  First of all in my day there weren't that many 
cars.  If anybody had a car it was not usually going to go out on the ice with it.  I mean you 
know, cares were very, well they just weren't common.  I mean the price was low but so was 
pays.  So I don't recall that.  Sleighs and things of that nature might have used the ice a lot more 
in my day but the were, in my day the sleighs and carriages were rare.  They were not unknown, 
but they were rare.  I mean we didn't have many cars.  We had a hell of a lot more cars than we 
did horses and teams in the thirties.  And ah, once again ah, anyone that had a horse and team at 
that time I don't think was thinking too much of taking it out on the ice for no reason at all except
to, so that (--)
D:  What about fishing on the water ways? 
E:  Fishing has always been a big thing here.  And of course ah, you know going back in time to 
the beginning of Lowell when Salmon fishing and sturgeon fishing were large ah, the Indians 
met here because of that.  The ah, area at the Falls was ah, an annual fishing area where the 
Indians would come to take the great amounts of Shad and Salmon, and Sturgeon.  And ah, 
Salmon are just being reintroduced now.  The last few years has been a heavy stalking program 
which each year gains a little.  Not as much as I guess as had been hoped for.  But certainly ah, 
there is some indication                              
that it will be successful now that the rivers have been changed.  By the way the rivers at the 
time that I'm speaking of were a hell of a lot cleaner than they were in the post war era.  Ah, there
was very manufacturing that dumped into the rivers up stream the way they, later happened.  And
many of the chemicals that are now dumped were not used.  Most of the chemicals used in those 
days would be dyes and things of that nature.  And I think that there was so little manufacturing 
in comparison with today that what was dumped in there could be assimilated by the river a lot 
easier and not create the problems.  Ah, after the war I took somebody fishing up to the ah, when 
I say the war I'm speaking of World War Two so I'm saying post forty-five.  The post forty-five 
era and I took somebody there in the early and ah, you know it was pretty pretty bad and there 
was very few people up there.  There would be scum on the water.  And ah, it was several years 
after that almost by accident it was discovered that chemicals were being dumped in large, large 
quantities surreptitiously.  And it was a, as I remember it ah, a professor at the University who 
discovered this and on his own because of the large number of water samples that were taken that
were, that were ah, polluted he started on his own checking up on the side streams that come 
down and ah, and finding out where these things were coming from.  And when he had enough 
evidence then he brought this all out and said these are the polluters.  This is why the river is 
polluted around here and ah, and his name was Panagiotakos I think.  Ah, he's still at the 
University today and he was, his main interest was water ah, what exactly he was interested in 
the water for I don't remember.  But, I know that he is still there and still has to do with water 
quality.  Ah, but ah, this condition didn't exist by any means as much did after the war.  In the 
thirties it didn't exist anywhere near in the severity that ah, it ah, was shown later on.  And if that 
is so then the canals that draw from the also were not as bad except for the fact that canal 
bottoms were just great repositories for anything that had to be thrown away.  And so you had a 
lot of debris.  And river banks also, which will be shown today if you walk along any bridge and 
look off and see the tires.  And of course the new thing is the ah, market baskets (--)
D:  Right.  
E:  But, ah, I still recall in the back of Lawrence Street opposite Charles where we had a rope 
swing and a tree that was used for diving that I remember one boy diving and being ripped up by 
a metal bed post that was stuck in the mud.  Now how long it had been there ah, as I say that one 
spot had been used very very often.  And ah, almost daily up to the point where he got hurt so 
wether it had been throw in there very frequently, recently or wether the action of the mud had 
lifted it out of the, ah into a more up right position or not I don't know but ah, there were dangers
of these sorts too as I say.  Cutting yourself on ugly metal sort of things of that nature.  Um, 
there's a young man in Lowell well he's a little younger than me.  He's not a young man any 
longer.  His names Sullivan, who at the Sixth Arched Bridge dive in one day and broke his neck. 
Ah, and I remember him wearing the cast for quite a long time.  Ah, so there were accidents of 
this sort as well as the drowning and ah, some of these might have taken place if they were in 
supervised and officially licensed areas.  But the problem here was that if you went in and this 
happened to you you were at the mercy of whatever other kids were around.  Hopefully, 
somebody old enough to have some idea as to know what to do.  But if you were with your, if 
you were twelve, thirteen or fourteen and with your peers ah, at a place like the Sixth Arched 
Bridge you were a long way removed from any area of help.  Because to get there you had to go 
through a play ground, down a bank, and through a little swamp and then follow railroad tracks 
until you came to it.  Ah, so you just didn't, you weren't that close to any any help.  So you 
telephone or something of that nature.  And even if you were then for somebody to get down to 
you it would take quite a while.  So these dangers existed and they existed I'm sure all over the 
country not just in Lowell.  But Lowell had the canals which other areas didn't have so in 
addition to brooks and ah, rivers we had this neat little system of neighborhood swimming holes 
that did such great things as whip you right along there and ah, you know.  The other thing was 
in the area that I swam in was in as I, speaking of being whipped along.  As I said there were 
three bridges.  The first bridge, the second bridge, and third bridge.  At the third bridge crossing 
the canal about a foot or foot and a half out of the water was a soil pipe.  And this was the safety  
valve.  This is what you put your arm up and hooked as you were swept down there.  So that, 
because if you went under there you went under the bridge.  And then you would go under 
Lawrence Street.  Ah, Lawrence Street itself was you know sort of loaded with spider webs and 
spiders.  And if your like me that the last thing you wanted.  And ah, so you'd hook, put your arm
up and hook your arm as you went under the pipe.  Grab it then pull yourself up and either shiny 
or stand up and walk the pipe to the bank.  And ah,
D:  Let me stop you right there I want to change this tape.
                           SIDE 2
D:  O.K.  We're rolling again.  This is the second tape of my interview with Ed Harley.  Um (--)
E:  The, one of the things that I wanted to bring out too is that in a day when before perhaps 
college was the, the for spawning spot for swimmers.  For champion swimmers, for Olympic 
swimmers and things of that nature.  That Lowell's canals and rivers produced ah, several people 
who ah, had national fame.  Probably most noted would be Henry Sullivan who was the first 
American ever to swim the English Channel.  And who tried it seven times before he succeeded.  
And who's times today would be considered nothing.  But he was the first American to make it 
and ah, you'd have to believe that he ah, started in the rivers or the canals.  There was a man 
named Ricky Keefe who, who had a hell of a lot of ah, records that were either national or ah, 
regional records.  And ah, who things like the Boston Lighthouse Swim which was ah, at one 
time considered the toughest swims ah, on the East, in the East at least [telephone rings in 
background] Excuse me.            
D:  Sure.
E:  Then there was a very interesting man named Mike Rynne who was a policeman ah in 
Lowell.  And a great swimmer, and he for years instructed swimming at the ah, municipal bath 
house on the Pawtucket Boulevard along with his nephew who is also a swimmer of note around 
here Danny Reagan.  And Mike Rynne until well after he retired and into his sixties and I think 
even into his seventies still put on one or two exhibitions a year up there.  He was a very large 
man.  And he would do such things as swim across the river with his hands and feet tied, (--)
D:  [laugh
E:  Or, with his hands tied tow a boat load of people across the river.  He would also swim the 
river tied to a chair.  Ah, and in a day of simpler pleasures I mean this would draw pretty large 
crowds at Labor Day or whenever it was he did it.  But an extremely nice person and one who 
got along very well with children as he instructed them.  Ah, very very well liked man.  Very 
widely known.  I mean most kids in Lowell knew him when they saw him.  But, this is the 
system I think that produced this.  I think that it's responsible for the fact that at that time we did 
have people who were known for the sport of swimming.   
D:  Were there any kind of races or other competitions on the river?        
E:  There were at other times.  But, but I don't recall anything famous.  There was what was 
called a Ricky Keefe.  I mentioned this man before.  They had races that used his name but how 
widely ah, entered they were by people from out of the area I don't know.  Ah, it's with the 
advent of television and with the advent of the easy availability of colleges or ah, after the 
second world war I think that the more structured type of swimming contest had ah, stopped.  Or 
at least taken the interest out of more local things of that nature.  The rivers at one time were 
used for races of, boat races, row boat races and ah, and ah racing shells.  Not from colleges but 
just from groups that would band together.  The Vesper Boathouse would have a group.  A group 
would get together and these were widely attended.  And widely, the people in them were widely 
known.  And they would put up their own purses.  Each team entering would put up five, ten 
dollars or whatever and on that basis would decide what the division would be between the 
winner and second an third.  Ah, one because the river was there it was utilized of course much 
more.  Personally I think than it is today.  I mean today you might have ah, power boat races or 
something of that nature.  But it just seems to me that to see somebody who worked in Lowell 
over there breaking his back with a pair oars puts the thing in a more personal basis.  
D:  Yeah, I see.
E:  Because you could have a man who worked in the mill or a man who was the bank president 
both out there doing it.  Today your not going to find too many people of small means ah, racing 
motor boats I don't think.  Because of the cost of getting the thing itself and the upkeep.  And 
lugging it around and taking the time to go from from one race to another. So, (--)
D:  Now who would sponsor these ah, these rowing boats?
E:  The people themselves.  As I say it would be ah, a neighborhood a club a, or just a few people
who got together and who liked rowing was a big, much bigger thing in those days.  There were 
many more row boats on the rivers and ah, and lakes and ah, because it ah, there were not any 
motor boats around at that time or out board motors.  Not to speak of at least.  Ah, in some cases 
there were none at all.  You know depending on what years your talking about.  But, rowing was 
there.  And so if you rowed a lot you maybe took a little pride in your prowess this would lead to 
other things.  And as I say as a simple pleasure it was one that didn't cost anything.  If somebody 
wanted to go up to the Boulevard and watch the races it was a nice walk from wherever you 
lived.  And then you got there and sat on the grassy bank had a little picnic watched this go on.  
Ah, the amusements were simpler but ah, as I said they [sufficed] for sure.  
D:  We're rowing shells?  
E:  Some were shells.  Some were just row boats and ah, it depends I guess ah, my knowledge of 
it is only from um, items that I run across in either books or newspapers saying that you know 
this race was to be won, or so and so did win a race.  And from the descriptions given you would 
know that they weren't not all shells.  But there were shells.  In some cases they would be skiffs, 
in some cases dories.  I mean it would just depend on, on ah, if you, certainly if you had a dory 
you weren't going to get in a race with somebody [laughter].  who had a, a racing shell.  So, you 
would look for a few other people who liked to row six man dories or whatever it's going to be.  
And if you like row boats your going to find yourself a guy with a one man row boat.  But if you 
read the old newspapers or if you read a couple of the books on the rivers you find out that this 
was, and also canoes of course because ah, with the very famous Two Weeks on the Concord and
the Merrimack by ah, by Mr. ah, Thoreau ah, you see that this was something that was done quite
a bit.  We have other books written about the Merrimack that talk about people coming up by 
canoe to examine and portaging around the Falls and things of that nature.  So that ah, it, if you 
wanted to get someplace and you wanted to take a heavy load well, best thing to do is get near a 
river and ah, build a raft and take it down.  In fact the canal system in Lowell ah, is here only 
because there was a need to get things around the Falls.  Things of produce and ah, lumber that 
was being brought down.  And that's why the original Pawtucket Canal was dug.  And ah, from 
that hence you know all the other canals ah, so that that's ah, that was the reason for it.  A means 
of transportation.  
E:  You were talking about fishing a moment ago.  Are there particular ah, bends in the river or 
fishing holes that have local names?  Well there probably are a lot of them that have local names 
but I can't give you any.  Ah, once again it would be an area name.  Ah, the Dizzy Bridge, ah, at 
South Lowell which would be off Lawrence Street.  I mean that would be the script of it.  And 
say, "where'd you catch it?  Well I caught it at the Dizzy Bridge at South Lowell." Or I caught it, 
you'd just give an area, a designation.  I don't know of anything that would say ah, You know 
Four Pound Sucker ah, Hole.  Or Big Bass Bend or something of that nature.  But the names I 
think would usually be just something that was not so much descriptive as directional.  
D:  Right.  So many miles from the bridge or something.
E:  Well, no, I don't think .  I'd just say the mill or the bridge or, whatever area was known.  Like 
Indian Rock if you see it, just out side, just out south of Indian or just above Indian Rock.  
D:  Where's Indian Rock?
E:  Well, Indian Rock is one of the swimming areas in the Concord River that I spoke of earlier.  
D:  Oh, yes.  Right.  
E:  Because it was a named area.  You could use that as a place of trying to fix it.  Or to, in 
another case of course, many fishermen wouldn't tell you.  They'd tell you some place 
completely different because they didn't want you up there.  Ah, but the areas that would be most
popular with fishing would be the ones where you didn't need a boat.  So the Trestle Bridge 
would be big because, or sitting under or it or an area of bank where there was a good stone wall 
that you could cast from.  And ah, I don't know of too many names for it.  But Bass fishing, 
Pickerel fishing in the Concord River was good.  It wasn't that good in the Merrimack, but good 
Pickerel fishing.  Ah, Bass both small mouth and large mouth, but the large mouth was the 
biggest.  A form of fishing that was engaged in a great deal which created or resulted in a large 
large fish was the Carp fishing.  Ah and the best fishing hole for those was around any sewer 
outlet and sewers did go into the river.  And Carp fed at these and attained great great weight.  
And you will now see if you pass the Akin Street Bridge your almost always going to see 
someone with bows and arrows.  
D:  Really?
E:  And that's the way they fish from the bridge with a reel attached to the arrow and they stand 
there and watch the Carp.  And as the Carp jump and leap they fire down from the fifty feet 
bridge floor.  And then tug them up.  And ah (--)
D:  That's something going on now.
E:  Yeah.  That's ah, that's fairly recent ah development.  Because if you fish from the bridge with
a rod you have to have dam heavy line to take a carp up that that ah, distance ah, so if you did 
fish for Carp from the bridge you usually would use a hand line with a heavy, very heavy line on 
it.  If you were using rod and reel you'd usually go under the bridge to fish.  But, the idea of 
catching Carp was that there were ah, people that would buy them to eat.  Ah, because ah, any 
native New Englander or any one who had spent anytime in New England is not going to eat 
Carp.  There going to consider that a trash fish.  But anyone from certain parts of Europe are 
going to find it very desirable since Carp is one of the main stays of the fishing diet.  And so 
there was somebody usually that would find and buy these off you.  Now, wether or not this was 
still going on.  The sale and purchasing of these fish from the more polluted river in the post war 
era, I don't know.  Ah, but certainly we were giving a hell of a lot more garbage to them so they 
were growing bigger I think.  Because once again the amounts of garbage that would be dumped 
in the thirties was not anywhere near as much as would be dumped later on.  Garbage was 
something that was taken away by itself in these days and utilized as a swine food so that ah, 
there weren't that, there wasn't that much that would find it's way into the river.  But Carps do.  
Where they are and Carp are bottom feeding fish that usually will find enough and they grow to 
large [unclear] But, ah, the main fish of many years ago was the [unclear] the Shad, the Salmon 
and the Sturgeon as I say well, Sturgeon has been gone for a good many years.  But, the Salmon 
were stopped mostly by the building of the dams.  It wasn't that pollution stopped them.  But, as 
each dam went up there was no way for the Salmon to get back up river.  
D:  Ah, ha.  
E:  Um, fish ladders were [unclear] into being ah, and they were built but it still had ah, was not 
to the degree of the rungs were not to the degree that they used to be.  And between this and once
again if the fish ladder fell into repair unless somebody complained I'm sure that the 
manufacturer weren't in any hurry to go out and spend money fixing it.  And ah, between that 
and the pollution later on the Salmon had been gone for quite a few years.  But ah, as I said 
hopefully within another ten years it's going to be an extremely valuable fish to us, and perhaps 
Shad too.  The ah, this, you not only have to clean up the main river, you have to clean up all of 
the inlets.  Where these things after they got to them would turn in and do their spawning.  But 
ah, at one time as I said the indians ah, this was where they would come to get their, a lot of their
food for the winter months.  They would come on these runs and just pull tons and tons of 
Salmon ah, out and Sturgeon too.
D:  How do you think most people in Lowell regard the waterways now?
E:  I don't know just what you mean.  
D:  I wondered if you had any general impression if people thought they were valuable?  
E:  Oh, yeah.  Oh, sure.  There was a, in the sixties, beginning in the early sixties, the late fifties, 
when we had a sort of mentality that said burry everything that's old, tear it down, destroy it.  Ah,
and in an era where a lot was destroyed that would be considered extremely valuable now.  One 
of the thoughts was since parking was a problem even then ah, to cover the canals.  Fill them in, 
cover them.  If not fill them in cover them completely so that they could be used ah for parking 
purposes.  And that was seriously considered by some.  Not by all.  But that brought, once again 
Lowell has always prided itself on being called the Venice of America.  Even if you didn't know 
much about the canals.  And even if you thought they were dirty, still it was something that was 
native to Lowell and many people didn't want to see them run away with.  But today of course 
there's a great pride in them.  I mean it's much different.  Because suddenly we are known for 
something that we took for granted but now realize what was a great engineering feat.  And it has
changed the complexion a lot.  We're extremely proud of the rivers because such a short time ago
they were so completely dirty and polluted that nobody, not too many people thought they could 
be brought back.  Um, millions and millions have been spent but, if the results are good and ah, 
right now as far as I know the Merrimack is a Class B River and close to Class A.  So I mean it's 
allowable for fishing and swimming both.  And ah, it just seems awfully funny to me that in all 
the years the Merrimack River was not polluted, or not polluted to the degree that it was 
distasteful to look at or to get into is that we drank water from sweet wells and ah, beautiful 
water system in Lowell and once the river became polluted then we went to the river for water.  I
have never really figured that one out.  But, so ah, and, and ah, our water was known.  Lowell 
had great water for drinking. And Lawrence was on the river for many years because they didn't 
have the capability of producing enough water for the ah, for city use through wells.  So they had
a plant right on the river for many years.  And ah, in ah, my days after I got out of the service as 
you went bar hopping or did your thing on weekends ah, I remember signs in some of the men's 
rooms saying, "Please stand close.  Lawrence needs the water."  You know so [laughter] it sort of
gave an indication as to ah, [laughter] what we thought of Lawrence's river water for drinking.  
That's true.  I'm not making that up.  
D:  Yeah.  
E:  Those signs existed and ah, nobody even chuckled over it.  Because, it got to be you know a 
usual thing.  And you just ended up a little closer so you wouldn't do somebody out of a, an 
aspirin chaser.
D:  You mentioned the term Dizzy Bridge before.  What, what (--)
E:  A Dizzy Bridge is a Trestle Bridge.  
D:  Why do they call it that?  
E:  Well, because if you've ever walked a Trestle Bridge you have to watch your feet because you
just can't step any where you want to.  Your foots going to go through between the trestles, 
between the ties.  And if you try this long enough you find out that it does have a tendency to 
make you dizzy.  Because as your looking down this way here below you is a flowing river and 
you get into this measured step which has to be broken every once in a while.  As you, as I recall 
walking a trestle you'd walk three ties and then you'd take a big step because some how your 
rhythm was interrupted every so often.  And you couldn't do this little pigeon toed dance over 
each and every tie for so long until suddenly your heal was in so you'd have to jump one.  But 
between all of this there was a tendency to ah, plus the height .  Many people would get dizzy 
being up there and looking down below the ties.  So as long as I remembered I had not thought 
until you brought that up that might be considered a kind of an odd term.  It was always the 
Dizzy Bridge to us.  And ah, I hear people talk of Trestle Bridges today but it translates in my 
mind instantly to Dizzy Bridge.  I had not even thought of, yeah.  But I mean I had not even 
thought that it might seem an exotic ah, term to someone who doesn't ah, understand.  It's, it 
would be interesting to find out from others in Lowell if the word Dizzy Bridge designates a 
Trestle Bridge to them.  Immediately I may not, you know but ah, they were called, I mean you 
know you'd say, "Where were you?  Out the Dizzy Bridge."  And that was it.  There were many 
of them.  There wasn't just one or two.  They were all over the city.  They were any place where a
train had to go to cross the river.  And trains didn't wait for you know didn't come across street 
bridges.  I mean they made their own way.  So that with all of the spurs and everything else there
were a great number, and still are a great number of trestle bridges.  The last one that was torn 
down was torn down at the Swamp Locks less than two years ago.  Ah, it was probably the most 
widely used short cut in the City of Lowell up until it was torn down.  Because anybody coming 
down Thorndike Street and going to go up to Dutton Street rather than make the wide corner you
would cut over what was called the Trestle Bridge and had on both sides of it wooden sidewalks 
built for the convenience of people which were kept up right till the end.  And you would use that
to cut over and then walk the tracks following Dutton Street all the way down into Market Street.
And that was, and that was a widely used, I mean you know just nobody walked to the corner 
and made a sharp right turn.  You just took that short cut.  Ah, if anybody said you know, "What 
is this?  You'd say, it's the Dizzy Bridge."  I mean even though you were not walking on the 
trestles.
D:  Right.
E:  Although you could walk on the trestles but.
D:  Doug mentioned a Mr. Joseph Pollard that you ah, met and recommended to Doug whose dad
apparently worked on the locks.  Are there other people you can think of that would have ah, 
such a knowledge of ah, work or play I guess on any of the water ways here?  
E:  Well, I can't give you the name of too many of men who worked for Locks and Canals 
although that's easy enough to get.  I mean a call to Locks and Canals would give you that.  Ah, 
also I, the only reason I knew about Mr. Pollard is that Mr.  Pollard's sister came to me several 
days before that to give me pictures of her father at the Lock.  And, when in the morning that the 
dedication was to be made I found out that the dedication was going on I called Mrs. Pollard 
then.  Not Mrs. Pollard I'm sorry, her maiden name was Pollard.  Ah, and told her that this was 
going to happen and she had made previous plans which couldn't be broken.  So she called her 
sister and brother to go down there.  And that's how I know about the Pollard's.  Otherwise I 
wouldn't.  But, there are, as I say there are still many people that still who work on them.  Any 
body in Lowell knows somebody perhaps.  As I said this is, it was just they were there and ah, 
and in Lowell the canals were there.  You knew people that worked on it.  I just can't give you a 
name off hand.  But I mean there's no problem in getting a hold of people.  I have some names of
people who worked there twenty years ago because I have some newspaper pictures and 
clippings of them as they did it.  There is a very famous gate keeper ah, whose name we have in 
the files somewhere.  Who kept the gatehouse at the Suffolk Mills.  And he was widely known 
because he made his, his area into a garden.  And he's been written up that way.  This is quite a 
few years ago.  Probably fifty years ago.  But, he had plants galore all over his, his gate house 
and on the canal.  Growing tomatoes and flowers and everything else.  So there were characters.  
There were a lot of people who worked ah, for the canal that I'm sure ah, for the locks proprietors
the Locks and Canals who had idiosyncrasies that would have made them interesting but ah, the 
one that comes to my mind, it was from a long time ago.  Ah, [long pause] well he really didn't 
work for the Locks and Canals.  He worked for one of the mills and his name was Shattuck.  But 
he had a lot to do with the building of the mills.  He, he along with ah, a very famous Irishman 
who was the first, who brought the first, the man that brought the first Irish into Lowell to dig the
power canals in nineteen, in eighteen twenty-two was a man called Hugh Cummiskey who took 
thirty-two Irishmen from Charlestown and walked from Charlestown up here to do this work.  
Ah, and was hired by Kirk Boott.  And he was one of the bosses of the jobs.  Another was a man 
named Shattuck, Moses Shattuck who worked for the original mill people.  Who at one time 
were the Proprietors of the Locks and Canals.  Or the Proprietors of the Locks and Canals I 
should say originally owned these mills and we're corporately divided later on.  Ah, the story is 
told of him, has nothing to do with his work in the canals.  Except that he was a widely known 
person.  And apparently a man of ah, some stature physically and as I recall with a red beard.  
Who dressed kind of, I'm not sure of the red beard, that sticks in my mind and I'm not sure if that
is something that I have some how added myself.  But he wore a red bandana according to 
reports.  And ah, a brass buttoned blazer type of a coat.  And he was a, he lived in a cottage on 
what is now Shattuck Street.  And what is now Shattuck Street and where the state ah, Heritage 
Park is was his garden.  Which was suppose to be very, very lush and profuse with blossoms and 
fruits and vegetables.  And he died one day ah, by himself in his home.  And when it was 
discovered that he was dead, and people went to take care of the remains somebody realized that 
there was no picture of him anywhere.  So they called in a photographer who dressed him sat 
him up crossed his legs and took a picture which according to the reports were available and 
around for a good many years.  This is taken from the reports of the old residence which is a 
historical group of writings which was done around um, the eighteen nineties and the turn of the 
century.  But I've always sort of admired and thought of that photographer you know.  And 
wondered if he said, "say cheese."  
D:  [Laughter].  
E:  At least he didn't have to tell him not to move, you know.  The day when that was important.  
Ah, there were a couple of other fellows that ah, given some time you could probably think of 
that had some idiosyncrasies that would make them interesting.  Or at least different.  Ah, who 
worked for these things.  But in the main any of the people who worked for the Locks and Canals
especially the ah, the grunts, the diggers, the people who had to get down there and do the pick 
and shovel work.  Ah, didn't have a hell of a lot of idiosyncrasies.  I'm sure at the end of a day all 
they had was a desire to get home and get something to eat and to lie down.  Because this was 
extremely hard, hard brutal work.  In very, very tough conditions.  But they did a hell of a job 
when you figure it was all done by hand.  
D:  Yeah.  
E:  There's another great story that tells about the opening.  And ah, I won't speak of this too 
much because ah, from the top of my head it won't come out ah, as complete as it should.  And 
that was at the opening of the Pawtucket Canal long before it was a power canal.  When it was 
going to be opened as a transportation canal.  And ah, the proud proprietors ah, stood there with 
all of the invited dignitaries from through out the state and all of the local Chelmsfordites would 
still be in Chelmsford at the time of course.  And as they stood there the poorly engineered banks
gave way and they were all swept into the canal.  And there's talk of mothers being separated 
from babies.  And it's an interesting thing once again available ah, in any of the histories and in 
also in the ah, older residents reports.  But ah, it was the start of what became many deaths.  And 
we also I just received a ah, clipping from somebody the other day that states we have as you 
know a ah, drowning this week of a young man.  Who, a thirteen year old boy actually playing 
around the banks of the canal up off the guard gates, Guard Locks and who somehow ended up 
in the canal.  And although taken out and rushed to Boston has since died.  And this is from a 
paper ah, Monday, October 5, 1857 from the New York Times.  We've also discovered the local 
reports of it ah, from this.  Ah, "coroners jury has been several days investigating the 
circumstances attending the alleged murder of a factory girl Maria Hall."  Ah, but what happens 
is she is discovered in a canal just below the Guard Locks in about the same place this kid went 
in and was taken out and then discovered after the autopsy that ah, she had been beaten and 
perhaps ah, well as this so delicately puts it um, "jury returned a verdict that she received a 
number of blows upon the head after which she was probably thrown into the canal.  A actual 
violation of her person having been previously committed."  So it's, that doesn't leave too much 
room for doubt for as to why she was thrown in after she had been used.  
D:  Right.  Well, I've pretty well exhausted my questions.  Was there anything else you wanted to
(--)
E:  Not really.  Ah, I, I you know I could think of a thousand things later on perhaps.  And if I do 
I'll let you know about them and then you can (--)
D:  O.K.  I'll be right around anyway.  The lunch hour is upon us and that's a good time to stop.  
E:  O.K.
