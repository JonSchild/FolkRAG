And thank you so much for agreeing to do this interview. 
 
SM: 
My pleasure.  
 
LG: 
And you know you’re being recorded, and I have permission to record? 
 
SM: 
I do. 
 
LG: 
Okay. And can you give me your birth year, please? 
 
SM: 
I was born in 1945. 
 
LG: 
1945. Okay. 
 
 
Can you (just to give us an orientation) talk about where you went to medical school, 
what year you entered, and what year you entered residency, and/or fellowship training? 
 
SM: 
Yes. I entered medical school, actually, in 1967, and finished medical school in 1971; did 
a year of internship at the Cincinnati General Hospital, and then two years of [ed. 
correction: residency] at the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital. And then a year of chief 
residency at the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital; and then two years of fellowship in neo-
natal/peri-natal medicine, at the University of Cincinnati. 
 
LG: 
And you attended medical school where? 
 
SM: 
At the University of Cincinnati. 
 
LG: 
The University of Cincinnati. Thank you. 
 
 
How did you decide to become a doctor? 
 
SM: 
I can’t ever remember a time when I wasn’t going to be a doctor. When I was extremely 
young, my mother would take me to a pediatrician who had had polio. And he walked 
with a limp, and I was fascinated.  
 
 
And so, whenever he would see me (even when I was very, very young), I would start 
asking him questions: I wanted to know about his equipment, I wanted to know what he 
did.  
 
 
So, often my visit at the pediatrician’s office would be half a day. Because he would take 
me in the back, because they’d have little labs, and run tests back there. And he would 
even take me in to see patients, and he would introduce me as, “This is going to be Dr. 
Minton.” 
 
[02:12]

And so, I can’t ever remember a time when I didn’t want to be a doctor. 
 
LG: 
And can you tell the story of how you decided to go to medical school and getting into 
medical school? 
 
SM: 
Well I always wanted to go to medical school (because I always wanted to be a 
physician). I was in an awkward position, because I had some world class skills in 
running and basketball; and so, I was being recruited by lots of people. And always in the 
back of my mind is, you know, “I want to be a doctor; that’s what I want to be.” But I 
love sports as well. 
 
 
And so, nature sort of made it so that that decision became even more and more obvious. 
I was a world-class runner in high school. And there was this new thing of lifting weights 
in order to gain strength. And I did it wrong one day and took out two vertebral hernias in 
my back. So, that made running a little bit harder, but I still played basketball.  
 
 
And after playing a year of freshmen basketball I tore the ligaments in my wrist. And so, 
I knew I wasn’t going to make it to the NBA (although my freshmen team beat the 
varsity in college, and they were the NCAA champions that year – the only two games 
they’d lost was to a freshmen basketball team). 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
SM: 
And so, when I was in college I started working in a hospital: St. Francis Hospital, in 
Cincinnati, Ohio. It was this little, Catholic hospital out in the boondocks.  
 
 
And so, they hired me as a tech when I was going to school (to college). And so, at 
nighttime I would do all the chemistries, all the micro-biology, draw the bloods – I would 
do everything there. In fact, I got in trouble once because I was playing basketball, 
working in a hospital, and pre-med, and I didn’t have time to go to one of my labs.  
 
 
And in one of my chemistry labs they were making methyl orange. So, I got a brilliant 
idea that I would buy methyl orange, I would put it in solution, then I would precipitate it 
out (so it would look like I made it).  
 
[04:45] 
 
 
I didn’t realize the solubility of methyl orange (I should have). It actually, I boiled a 
whole bottle of it away, and it went into the atmosphere of the hospital. And the next day, 
when they turned the air conditioner on, it precipitated out on all the nuns’ white gowns, 
all the counters, all the patients. And I actually, for about a month, every time I took a 
shower I bled orange in the drain –  
 
LG: 
[Laughing] 
 
SM: 
And so, that furthered my desire for medicine.

LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
SM: 
I’m going to tell you a story –  
 
LG: 
Okay? 
 
SM: 
About one night –  
 
LG: 
I’m going to move this back just a little bit. Go ahead. 
 
SM: 
The pathologist called, and he said, “I don’t have anybody to assist me on an autopsy in 
the morning; would you get the body ready?” 
 
 
And so, I said, “Oh, yeah; I would love to do that.” 
 
 
And so, the morgue was a converted chapel in the basement of St. Francis hospital. And 
you had to go down these long corridors to get there. And I was having trouble getting 
the door open. It was a Saturday, and there was a rainstorm outside (it rains a lot in 
Cincinnati, so a lot of my stories are with rainstorms and lightning). So, there was a 
rainstorm and lightning.  
 
 
And when I finally popped the door of the morgue open, the first thing I saw was Jesus 
on a cross, hanging from the wall; and underneath, the patient we were going to do a post 
on had pulled itself up (it had retracted) – so, it was sitting up with a sheet over it, and 
lightning coming through the windows, and Jesus on a cross, hanging over top of the 
body. It scared me. 
 
LG: 
Holy moly. 
 
[06:50] 
 
SM: 
Yes. That was the first post that I ever did. 
 
LG: 
Wow. Well for people who don’t know what it’s like, what was medical school like when 
you went through it? 
 
SM: 
When I went through medical school, most of the students were in families where there 
was a doctor. There were 100 students in my class in Cincinnati (and it was one of the 
premiere medical schools in the United States at the time); 96 of them were men, and 
there were four women in my class.  
 
 
So, it was predominately males and predominately people whose fathers or grandfathers 
were doctors, and who had donated money to the school. I was one of the very few who 
came from a family – I didn’t have anybody who really went to college in my family, or a 
Physician Oral History: Stephen Minton 
Page 5 
 
professional. I had an uncle and a grandfather who had done mail order preaching 
degrees and were preachers.  
 
 
And so, when I went I was somewhat intimidated by the fact that I didn’t have anybody 
there rooting for me, or donating money for me. So, I was concerned that I would never 
be able to make it through this whole thing.  
 
 
Fortunately, my grades in college had been good enough, so they gave me a scholarship. 
And so, I made it through medical school. I got married out of college, and we lived in a 
little basement apartment, and I worked at a hospital and made some money (that we ate 
with). And then I used my scholarship to pay for my tuition. And I borrowed my books. 
 
LG: 
What was the hardest thing about medical school? 
 
[08:49] 
 
SM: 
I loved medical school. I loved learning. So, even when I was in medical school, I would 
talk to pediatricians, and go to their offices. So, I actually did something almost every 
night: I either worked at a hospital, or went to a doctor’s office, or was doing extra. So, if 
I had the ability, I would only need about two to three hours of sleep a night.  
 
 
And so, I was very lucky. In addition, God gave me a gift of being able to look at 
something and know it. I can still close my eyes and see my neurosurgery notes from [ed. 
correction: 50] years ago; I can see the color on them. I can read the writing. 
 
LG: 
So, you have a photographic memory? 
 
SM: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
That’s amazing. 
 
SM: 
Yeah. At one point, I memorized the entire krebs cycle. 
 
LG: 
[Laughing] 
 
SM: 
When I was in college, I took a graduate course in abnormal psychology. So, I was the 
only undergraduate in this class (at the University of Cincinnati). And I went to the 
professor, and I said, “I want to do something really different than anybody else.”  
 
 
So, he said, “Well I could teach you how to hypnotize somebody, and we could do an 
experiment.” 
 
 
And I said, “I’d like to hypnotize the class.” 
 
Physician Oral History: Stephen Minton 
Page 6 
 
 
So, we came up with this thing where we divided the class in half. And we told one half 
the class to leave, and the other half of the class – I stood up in front of them and I talked 
to them.  
 
 
And I told them to relax, that they were never going to fail this class; it was impossible to 
fail the class, and I was going to hypnotize them and they were going to relax and they 
could sleep through the class – they had to come, but they could sleep through the class, 
anything they wanted, and they would do really well on the final. And I worked on them 
for about an hour.  
 
 
That half of the class scored one full [ed. correction: grade] higher than the other half of 
the class that had read, listened, took notes, and everything. These people never took a 
note, they just came and would sit there and relax, and sleep and stuff, but they listened. 
And so, that was my graduate abnormal psychology class. Yeah. 
 
[11:22] 
 
LG: 
And how did you decide to –  
 
SM: 
But you asked me what the hardest thing was. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
SM: 
The hardest thing of medical school, I believe, was trying to figure out what the future – 
where I wanted to be. Because everything that I took, I wanted to be that. I wanted to be 
an obstetrician; I wanted to be a psychiatrist; I wanted to be a surgeon; I wanted to be a 
pediatric surgeon; I wanted to be a pediatric infectious disease person. I did decide I 
loved pediatrics.  
 
 
And then I was fortunate enough at Cincinnati, to come in contact with the neonatology 
program. Now, in the United States, neonatology was just developing, basically. I took 
the second boards – I’m number 54 board-certified neonatologist in the United States: 
number 54. 
 
 
And so, I saw that as a little bit of everything: I worked with pregnant women, I worked 
with fetuses, I worked with newborns – in a time when almost [ed. correction: every 
preterm newborn] died. When I first started, I would lose two to three babies every day – 
they would die. So, it was an opportunity to be part of the development of a specialty; to 
be able to know the natural history of diseases, and not come in and just do what other 
people had done.  
 
 
But I had to learn how to put death in perspective. Because when you lose two or three 
babies every day, you begin to wonder if what you’re doing is making a difference, if it’s 
worth the stress. There are very few people my age still doing what I’m doing because 
the burnout was horrendous early on.  
 
Physician Oral History: Stephen Minton 
Page 7 
 
 
And then people [ed. insertion: my age] decided to go into administration [ed. correction: 
or retire]. And so, I just decided to do all of it. So, up until recently I was doing two and a 
half full-time [ed. insertion: clinical] equivalents a year.  
 
[13:35] 
 
LG: 
What does that mean? 
 
SM: 
It meant that the normal person puts in about 2,000 hours a year, in a 40-hour a week job; 
two years ago I put in 3,850 hours, instead of 2,000. 
 
LG: 
Wow. 
 
SM: 
Which is over 16 hours a day, seven days a week for the year.  
 
LG: 
Oh, man. 
 
SM: 
And so, I’m somewhat obsessive-compulsive, somewhat I’m a workaholic; but I don’t 
see this as work. I don’t see it as a job; I see it as a privilege. 
 
LG: 
Well let’s go back a little bit and talk about why you decided pediatrics early on was 
something that you were attracted to? 
 
SM: 
I think it was because that pediatrician that I described, who had the polio – I only 
mention the polio because he talked to me frequently about it, that it wasn’t a handicap to 
him. 
 
LG: 
And neonatology – how did you decide on neonatology, specifically? 
 
SM: 
It was an opportunity to do things that other people had never done: to develop new 
approaches and make such a difference. I mean, there was one time in my life when I 
traveled around the world, lecturing, that they called me “Mr. HFOV” for High 
Frequency – because we taught more doctors high frequency, than anybody (how to use 
that device, a ventilator).  
 
 
And so, I’ve always been fortunate enough to be in a place where I haven’t been limited, 
I could use my imagination. I have a skill of being able to communicate with people, and 
so people want to participate around me (generally) and be part of it. And I’m a good 
enroller, of both patients and staff. And people like to be part of creation. 
 
[15:50] 
 
 
There’s a part of our brain of creation. There’s also a part of our brain, it’s part of what’s 
called “chaos theory.” A lot of people don’t like chaos; a lot of people like it to be [ed. 
insertion: straightforward]: you do one thing, and then you do another thing. I’m a big 
Physician Oral History: Stephen Minton 
Page 8 
 
believer in chaos, because I believe that gets the juices going, and you begin to apply 
from one thing to the other.  
 
 
So, one time in my unit I had 32 different quality improvement [ed. insertion: projects] 
going at the same time in my unit. And that year, we saved five million dollars, and we 
reduced length of stay in our babies 2,770 days. 
 
LG: 
Wow. 
 
SM: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Wow. 
 
SM: 
But a lot of people don’t like that; they say it creates burnout, it creates an opportunity 
that’s not safe. In reality, we have more errors in our unit when it’s quiet, because the 
people relax, and they’re going to do it later. And when we’re busy, you have to do it 
now, and you have to think, and you’re more into it. 
 
 
So, during that time, about 90% of all of 150 employees in our unit, all participated in 
teams of redesign. Our goal was to look at everything we do, and not take anything as 
sacred. You look at everything we do: What is the value of it? What should be done? 
 
 
We would suction our babies on ventilators, because we knew that the ventilator created 
secretions; so, we would suction them every four hours. So, I had a team and the team 
worked on, “What do you do to prepare for suctioning? What do you do to recover after 
suctioning?” (Because they often get sicker.)  
 
 
And I had a mother on that team, and the mother said, “Well wait a minute, if this is so 
good, why does my child get sick every time you do it, and we have to recover my 
child?”  
 
 
So, we quit suctioning, and guess what? The babies had the same outcome but they didn’t 
have all the problems with the suctioning. 
 
[17:49] 
 
 
So, we put a lot of parents on most of our teams, because healthcare, really, has been 
created for doctors and nurses: it hasn’t been created for patients. Patients will often tell 
you it’s not how they see it, it’s not empowering to them (many times). 
 
 
So, when I first started this [ed. insertion: as a physician], parents weren’t allowed in the 
delivery room (or fathers – obviously, the mother was present [laughs] in the delivery 
room), but fathers were not allowed in. So one month, I was in delivering babies; and 
then my wife goes in to deliver, and they tell me, “You can’t go in here, because you’re 
not sterile.” And I said, “Well obviously, I’m not sterile, because my wife’s having a 
baby, right?” They didn’t think that was so funny. 
Physician Oral History: Stephen Minton 
Page 9 
 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
SM: 
Well I told them I was calling the local newspaper, that you had kidnapped my wife. 
(That was another time I was called into the chief medical officer’s office.) But then 
suddenly,  [ed. correction: delivery rooms] opened up and we were allowed at Cincinnati 
to have fathers present in the delivery room. 
 
 
And so, I’ve always sort of been one of those kinds of people that look at what you do, 
and say, “How can you do it better? Why are we even doing this?” You know? 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
SM: 
And tradition is very strong in medicine. Most people don’t realize that less than 15% of 
what we do has been proven by randomized control trials and research. The majority of 
what we do is tradition, where we trained – and we perpetuate that. And it’s easier, you 
go home quicker [ed. insertion: at night] if you just follow the protocol. But it may be the 
wrong protocol.  
 
 
So, I’ve always been one of those people who – I’m an irritant to some people, I’m 
obnoxious to some people; but by the majority of people, I’m loved because they see me 
as their advocate. Parents love me, because I spend time talking to them; I treat them how 
I want to be treated. I educate them like I would like to be educated, if it was my child.  
 
[20:03] 
 
 
But it means you stay around, sometimes, a long time. The people who suffer from it is 
often your family. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. Can you talk a little bit about establishing this NICU unit? 
 
SM: 
Well I trained at the University of Cincinnati, and it was one of the largest neonatal 
programs in the country. And after having been through my medical school, internship, 
residency, chief residency and fellowship there, I could fall asleep in a lecture, wake up, 
and finish the lecture for whoever the doctor was who was giving  [ed. correction: the 
talk], because I had heard it multiple times. 
 
 
So, I didn’t want to stay there, because I wanted to go in more of a frontier place, that you 
could really make a difference. So, I came to Utah. Utah had a program at the University 
of Utah. Like most states, there was one medical school, and one major hospital that did 
newborn babies. And all of the care was provided at university hospitals.  
 
 
So, I was at the University of Utah; I was hired there, and I was the medical director of 
the newborn intensive care unit at the University Hospital. There was a children’s 
hospital, in name, that was up in the Avenues; but it was very small, and it was mainly a 
Physician Oral History: Stephen Minton 
Page 10 
 
cardiology clinic hospital. And it was owned by Intermountain Healthcare. And the 
University [ed. correction: owned the University Hospital NICU] (University of Utah). 
 
 
So, I was asked to take 13 babies from the University of Utah, and go over to the Primary 
Children’s, and open a nursery there – to help with its survival (because they just didn’t 
have enough patients to make it a profitable deal). 
 
 
So, I took 13 patients over there, opened that nursery. And in doing that, I came in 
contact with many of the private pediatricians in Provo, Utah. And they said to me (as a 
joke) once, “Why don’t you come down here and open a newborn intensive care unit 
down here? We would support you if come down there.” 
 
[22:16] 
 
 
And I said, “Well I can’t cut my umbilical cord from the university; I’ve got research, 
I’ve got all [ed. correction: kinds of] stuff [ed. insertion: going on]” 
 
 
And it was about that time that interns, residents, and medical students were complaining 
that they were spending half of their training program in the newborn ICU, starting IVs, 
doing scut work. And then when they graduated, they weren’t allowed to see those 
patients: they were taken care of at the University Newborn ICU. 
 
 
So, it became obvious to me that the model of iniversity ICUs was not one that was going 
to last long-term. So, I thought, “What model would work?” 
 
 
Well you’d have to leave the university. And you’d have to get enough people to support 
you. 
 
 
So, being the guy who always jumps off of the bridge, and then says, “I wonder how far 
down that water really is?” 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
SM: 
I jumped, and I came down here. And it took seven and a half years to coax another 
neonatologist to join me.  
 
 
So, once I jumped and came down here, and I started having sick babies – it became 
difficult to go home at night, because there was no one (really) basically to turn the 
babies over to. 
 
 
So, first of all, I started giving the same lectures to the nurses and respiratory therapists 
here that I had given to the interns, residents and fellows at the University of Utah. So, I 
started raising their level [ed. insertion: of skill] and their scope [ed. insertion: of 
practice]. Some of those people are still here, because they got a chance to practice at a 
level that they couldn’t do at other places. 
 
Physician Oral History: Stephen Minton 
Page 11 
 
 
And so, I ran the unit (basically) with the nurses, respiratory therapists, and pediatricians 
sometimes would come in and help. And so, our outcomes really became quite good, and 
our care was consistent because there was one person. I trained everybody, so everybody 
did it just like me.  
 
 
At the university, when you change attendings, they change approaches. Here [laughing] 
it was the same approach.  
 
[24:40] 
 
 
And then late one night, after seven and a half years, I got a call. And it was a doctor who 
was in the Air Force. And he says, “Dr. Minton, I’m Ron Stoddard. I was actually born in 
the hospital there (years ago) and I have family in the area. Would you ever consider 
having a partner?” 
 
 
And I said, “If you come tomorrow, I will turn the nursery over to you.”  
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
And so, he came on a vacation – he wasn’t going to be out [ed. insertion: of the Air 
Force] for a year. So, he came on his vacation, and we worked together for a week, and 
he says, “I want to be here.”  
 
 
So, when he graduated he came. And that reduced my call in half: from 365 days a year, 
down in half. And the whole time we were together, we never had a single argument or 
disagreement. 
 
[Phone ringing] 
 
 
Sorry. 
 
 
I have been so fortunate to be in a (at the time) a relatively small town. When I came here 
it was about 80,000 people; to have a sophisticated newborn ICU; to live in a mountain 
like Sundance, so 25 minutes away I am at a beautiful ski resort on a mountain; have 
fantastic staff; have been able to do research and create. Just at your first place that you 
go to – it’s highly unusual to be able to get all of that together at the same time. 
 
LG: 
That’s pretty cool. 
 
 
Can you talk about what being a neonatologist means, and what your work is like? 
 
[26:42] 
 
SM: 
Let me give you the punchline of that. I live in a town (now) of about 350,000 people. If I 
go to Costco tonight, there’s a good chance at least five women will come up and hug 
me, and say to me, [emotion in voice] “You saved my baby’s life!” I can’t go to a 
restaurant without someone coming up and hugging me. 
Physician Oral History: Stephen Minton 
Page 12 
 
 
 
Most people, when they see their doctor, say, “You’re my doctor.” Women don’t do that, 
though, who have had babies in the unit. The perception that the baby could die is so 
strong, and the relationship becomes so intimate that they say to me, “You saved my 
baby’s life.” 
 
 
We have so many nurses in our unit who had babies in our unit, and then went back to 
nursing school after the kids got out, because they saw what it meant. 
 
 
I learned a great deal in the seven years that I was here by myself. What I learned was 
how important we become in the lives of people. [Emotion in voice] We become family 
members. They put their complete trust in us; we have the power to help them make 
major decisions that will affect their life forever. And I mean, it’s a very enabling 
position to be in; but it’s also one that you have to take with great respect and humility.  
 
[28:40] 
 
 
When I was here by myself, there was a time when I had quadruplets born, that each 
weighed a pound. And two hours later, I had another one-pound baby. So, this is in the 
very early 80s, when I have five one-pound babies born on the same day, within two 
hours – where 80% of those babies should die, and I’m by myself.  
 
 
So, I said to the mother, “We can transfer the babies.” And she says, “Well I don’t want 
to. I want you to take care of them.” So, I lived at the hospital for just under three 
months; I didn’t go home. And we got four of the five babies through it. Three of them 
just came back from an LDS mission. 
 
 
But during that time period, what I learned was how important the people around you are. 
One person doesn’t get all that done. The value of the nurses, who see the baby around 
the clock, and you’re at a bedside for an hour. The respiratory therapists, who are helping 
you run the ventilator – they’re not technicians who set up the machine: they’re people 
that bring a valuable thing [ed. correction: to the table]. 
 
 
So, we would do rounds where everybody gave input. And I delegated a great deal out to 
people. I learned how to delegate. I learned how to value people. Now that doesn’t mean 
that I didn’t have it when I was at the University of Utah, or Cincinnati – I valued people. 
But I got a new appreciation of how high they could actually function.  
 
[30:39] 
 
 
And so, I think most of our nurses in our unit and respiratory therapists will tell you that 
they haven’t left because that they feel valued.  
 
LG: 
How do you handle (or how have you learned to handle) the responsibility of taking care 
of sick and premature babies or newborns? That’s a great responsibility.

SM: 
Well my wife will tell you that as soon as I walk in the door, she’ll know [emotion in 
voice] if something happened that day that wasn’t great. But the way I believe I handle it, 
is I had to get to a point where I realized that what my job is, is not [ed. correction: the 
survival of the baby].  
 
 
My job is to give the baby every opportunity to reach its potential. And maybe that 
potential is one hour [ed. insertion: of life], for the mother to see it alive; and maybe it is 
survival, down the road. But my job is to give them the opportunity, and if I do that, then 
I can go to sleep at night.  
 
LG: 
Can you talk a little bit about those early days that you referred to, when neonatology was 
just kind of an emerging specialty? 
 
SM: 
It was – for me, that is probably the worst time of my medical career, was in the very, 
very beginning: not because it was hard, but because we didn’t know a lot, and we lost a 
lot of babies. And there was traditions that – for example, if a baby got an air leak on a 
ventilator (and we were using very primitive machines), lots of babies got air leaks 
around their lungs – I would have to call a surgeon (who might be at home), who would 
drive in. And they would take the baby to an operating room, scrub the chest like a 
regular surgery, and put a tube in. And many times that baby was dead before he made it 
there. 
 
[33:10] 
 
 
So, one night a baby got an air leak – I just took a needle, popped it in, pulled the air out 
and made the baby better. But I got in serious trouble, because I had done a surgical 
procedure on a baby. And so, I was called in with the surgeon and we had a discussion.  
 
 
And what I said (basically) was is, “I did what needed to be done to make the baby better. 
And I am more than happy to defer to any surgeon who wants to stay around here and 
stay in the unit, and when we get an air leak, put the tube in right away – I’d be more than 
happy to do that.” We then started putting needles into chests. And it’s standard of care 
today. 
 
LG: 
And this was just instinctual, or you sort of just –  
 
SM: 
Well there was air in the chest –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
SM: 
And the baby was dying. The obvious treatment is to get the air out of the chest. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
SM: 
I have in my hand a needle that will take the air out of the chest. 
 
LG: 
So, just do it? 
Physician Oral History: Stephen Minton 
Page 14 
 
 
SM: 
I did it. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
SM: 
I told the parents – they were standing there. I said, “I think your baby’s dying. I’m going 
to put a needle in your baby’s chest and get the air out.” So, I did it. 
 
 
When I started as an intern at the University of Cincinnati, all the doctors wore black or 
white pants, a white shirt, and a black tie, and a white jacket. And every time I would go 
into a baby’s room to draw bloods or whatever, they would see the white jacket and they 
would start to cry, their ears would get red, you couldn’t tell if they had otitis, it was 
really hard to draw blood. 
 
 
So, I wore a Hawaiian shirt to work one day. And I went in and the baby didn’t cry, and I 
was able to draw the blood. So, I was called into the chief medical officer, who explained 
to me that real doctors wore white jackets and don’t wear Hawaiian shirts.  
 
 
And I explained to him why I did it, and what it was; and he says, “Well real doctors 
don’t do that.” And I said, “Could we make a deal? The first time a parent says to me, ‘I 
don’t think you’re a real doctor,’ then I’ll wear a white jacket and a white shirt.” He said, 
“Well I don’t think that,” –  
 
LG: 
[Inaudible] 
 
[35:41] 
 
SM: 
I said, “Alright.” 
 
 
By the time I was a senior resident, everybody (including the attendings) wore colored 
shirts, right? And they made me chief resident. And the first day I showed up with a 
white jacket on, and the chief medical officer called me in and he said, “You know, 
Minton, I thought you’d figured out [ed. insertion: something] – you’ve just got to be 
different, don’t you?” 
 
LG: 
[Laughing] 
 
SM: 
And I said, “Yes, sir; I do.” 
 
LG: 
That’s [inaudible].  
 
 
What are some of the best experiences, or a best experience you’ve had here in the NICU 
unit? 
 
SM: 
Well I have best experiences every day. Because every day I’m doing what I love. Every 
day I believe I make a difference in somebody’s life. Every day. And it’s addicting to do 
Physician Oral History: Stephen Minton 
Page 15 
 
that, because you know that at some point you have made such an impression out there, 
you really have changed the world. Maybe a little, small world, but you’ve changed that 
world: you’ve had a real powerful influence on it. 
 
 
I have been real fortunate to be involved in some fabulous cases. When I was at the 
University of Utah, I was called shortly after going there and becoming the director, that 
there were Siamese twins born at the head (they were connected at the head) in McKay-
Dee Hospital (up north). 
 
 
I went in an ambulance and picked them up. And by the time I had made it back to the 
University of Utah, it had become a national story. There were probably 50 reporters 
there. I went up, took care of the kids. And then that evening they said there were so 
many reporters downstairs that I needed to go down. 
 
[37:47] 
 
 
So, I went down and did a press conference on it. Over the next (about) 15 months, we 
did six major surgeries. It was on Good Morning – it was everywhere.  
 
 
Unfortunately, they took my first press conference and videoed it. And then [ed. 
insertion: when] I gave out some [ed. correction: information] (but very small) from then 
on; but about every month, the local stations would take my original press conference and 
look like a reporter was asking me a question, and then my answers, right? So, my 
children thought I only had one set of clothes, because they were on every time they saw 
me on TV, I had exactly the same clothes on.  
 
 
We ended up separating them, because one of them, it looked like the brain was growing 
into the other’s brain. So, [laughs] the weekend before – I was the head of the team. So, I 
was going to be in the operating room, and we estimated it would be a 20-hour surgery. 
So, I was part of setting up pf the thing; and we were going to have three neurosurgeons, 
three anesthesiologists – we had three separate teams.  
 
 
So, one team would operate for two hours while the other team assisted, and one team 
was sleeping. And then the one sleeping became the assistant, the assistant became the 
operator – we just kept rotating. But I stayed there in the [ed. correction: OR], taking care 
of all of the medical, the fluids, and all the stuff.  
 
 
But I knew that was going to happen, so the weekend before I decided to go to Lake 
Powell to rest. And a friend had a houseboat down there, and we got on the houseboat. As 
we were coming back [ed. insertion: to Salt Lake City] (so I could drive back up to get a 
good night’s sleep) the guy who owned the boat forgot to drive it, and we drove it into 
the wall of Lake Powell and got all of the ropes around the motor, so we had to get that 
untangled.  
 
[39:47] 
 
Physician Oral History: Stephen Minton 
Page 16 
 
 
And then we drove up to – we were leaving [ed. insertion: Lake Powell], and as we came 
up out of Bullfrog, there was a [ed. insertion: car] wreck. [Emotion in voice] And a little 
kid was thrown out of the car and stuck in a cactus bush. And I ran over and the baby’s 
abdomen was filling up and I knew this baby had ruptured either the spleen, or the liver, 
or something. The car behind me was an anesthesiologist, and he had ET tubes in his car.  
 
 
 
And so I intubated this kid, through the blood and we started [ed. correction: hand 
resuscitating the child]. And a state highway patrolman came, and I said, “I need Life 
Flight.” So, he called up and they dispatched a Life Flight [ed. insertion: helicopter] 
down to Hanksville, Utah.  
 
 
And I’m carrying the baby in my arm, bagging the baby, and it’s bleeding [ed. insertion: 
in the back seat of the patrol car]. And we get to Hanksville, the tube falls out, and there’s 
so much blood I couldn’t get the tube back in, and the baby died in my arms.  
 
 
[Emotion in voice] So, I got three hours sleep before we went into the operating room; 16 
hours later though, we came out, and the girls were separated and alive.  
 
LG: 
Wow. 
 
SM: 
And we made it through that. And they’re alive today.  
 
 
And so, that was one of those kinds of [ed. correction: experiences] where you start, and 
there’s no way you’re going to separate [ed. insertion: the twins], and we figured out a 
plan, and we did it, and we made it through it. That was a rewarding case. 
 
 
There are so many different kinds of cases. One of the cases that was down here that I 
remember, was a woman who had a large tumor (or the baby who had a large tumor) on 
its back (the lower back), and it got caught in the mom’s vagina. And they couldn’t get 
the baby up or down. And so I intubated the baby in her vagina, and put a tube in the 
belly button, in her vagina, and resuscitated the baby. We split the tumor, got it out, and 
we saved that baby. And [ed. correction: the child or now adult] has a mild limp. 
 
 
One day I was called to the ER because there had been a wreck in the Provo Canyon, by 
the Provo River, in the middle of dead winter: ice cold. The river is full of glacier water, 
really cold. And there had been a wreck, and two people had been killed. I go to the ER, I 
come back upstairs.  
 
[42:35] 
 
 
And the truck that had hit that car, had pushed that car into another car, which had gone 
under water. And two hours later, they realized there were four people in that car, under 
the water. And two of them were in the back seat and were kids in seatbelts.  
 
 
So, they bring them into the ER. And because it was cold water (and I didn’t know at the 
time how long it had been), I started a resuscitation. One was obviously dead; the other, I 
Physician Oral History: Stephen Minton 
Page 17 
 
got some heart rate back. And I worked for another hour. So, we are three or four hours 
into this daggone thing. And I couldn’t get the baby back and I stopped.  
 
 
And I went upstairs, and everybody left; and the baby was there [ed. insertion: in the 
ER]. And the nurse called me a half an hour later, and she says, the heart rate is up to 90, 
the baby has taken some gasps (it was a young child, rather than a baby). So I go down, 
and I called a code again, and I couldn’t get anybody to help me, because everybody 
thought this was a dead child, and I was trying to save a dead child and was going to –  
 
 
And I had to yell: “You will help me.” And then I realized that this baby had been cooled 
down, so I froze her down again: I put ice around her, I put on a phenobarb coma, kept 
her on a ventilator for three days, and woke her up. And she’s normal now. 
 
LG: 
Wow. 
 
SM: 
Now, if you did that 100 times, you may have 99 times failing – don’t know in this 
particular one. What I learned from that is sometimes you don’t know; which way are 
you going to err when you don’t know?  
 
 
And so, there have been babies that I have resuscitated that have not done well. But the 
deal that I always make with parents is, if we don’t do something, we know the outcome; 
if we do something, and we say, “We don’t know where we’re going, but we’re not 
committed to everything.”  
 
[44:50] 
 
 
So, we’ll have babies born, and I’ll say, I will evaluate in the delivery room, and start a 
resuscitation; if it’s not meant to be, I’ll stop; but if it’s still going, we’ll go. We’ll re-
evaluate in a half an hour, we’ll re-evaluate in an hour, we’ll re-evaluate in a day. We’ll 
re-evaluate, and if it’s not meant to be, then we will say that I did a resuscitation for two 
or three days and it was unsuccessful and you [ed. insertion: can] hold your baby.  
 
 
With doing that, I have found that parents can close because they know everything was 
done. And if you don’t give them that everything was done, they go through life with 
guilt; and it often just destroys families. The divorce rate, the mental illness rate is sky-
high in families where that is.  
 
 
Now that doesn’t mean that if you do that, everything is perfect and rosy; but I believe 
people are able to close easier in that kind of a scenario. 
 
 
I could go on with stories forever, if you want me to. 
 
LG: 
You can go on as long as you want. 
 
[Laughter] 
 
Physician Oral History: Stephen Minton 
Page 18 
 
 
You had some stories written down that you wanted to tell too – it doesn’t necessarily 
have to do with my questions? 
 
SM: 
Oh, you know, I was (in many ways) by coming to Provo, Utah – a little, small place – it 
was different than in academic medicine, because there are traditions in academic 
medicine – so there’s not as many traditions here. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
SM: 
And so, we created many of those traditions. Today, 60% of all the NICUs in the United 
States are private like this. 
 
LG: 
Oh, really? 
 
SM: 
And only 40% are academic. Where in those days, it was 100% academic. 
 
 
I’m a teacher – I love teaching. And I’ve been accused of being a preacher, because of 
the way I teach, when in fact, it’s the truth.  
 
[47:08] 
 
 
When I was ten years old, my grandfather was the minister of the church I went to, and it 
was the Church of the Nazarene, which is the old-time Methodist: hellfire and brimstone. 
And my grandfather would be up there, and he would be kicking his legs, and hitting his 
fists, and his voice would go up, and it would come down.  
 
 
And with my photographic memory, on the way home from church I would repeat the 
sermon, or I would repeat the sermon from four weeks earlier. And so my grandfather 
believed that it was a sign: that I was meant to be a preacher, that God had touched me in 
it. 
 
 
And so there would be revival meetings, and I actually started preaching when I was ten 
years old, in revival meetings, and touching people in healing services. And I realized 
that preaching (in our church) was like singing: there’s a chorus –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
SM: 
And you go up, and you go down, and you change it, and that’s how you enroll people in. 
And my teaching really is exactly the way I used to preach to people. 
 
 
After doing that for two years, I realized that I was really meant to be a doctor, not a 
preacher. And my healing was going to be in a different way. 
 
 
Interestingly, about healing – what I learned from that was the power of positive thinking 
in so many people. Because I would see people who seemed to have an affliction, and 
Physician Oral History: Stephen Minton 
Page 19 
 
after a talk, and after touching them and telling them they’re better, you would see some, 
some changes.  
 
 
And so, I do that with my patients. I tell my parents when I meet with them that we can 
put two things around your baby: a positive or a negative atmosphere, and your baby will 
live up to that.  
 
[49:18] 
 
 
And so I do preach [laughs], in a way, still. 
 
 
When I was in medical school there was an underserved area in Kentucky, in Hyden, 
Kentucky. And the only healthcare workers they had were actually debutantes from New 
York City, who were sent there by their parents to spend six months on a medical mission 
before they had their coming out parties in New York City.  
 
 
And one of the rich people in New York had built a house, and it was called the Frontier 
Nursing Home. And they took care of all the people around. And they really didn’t have a 
doctor. But some of these [ed. insertion: local] people would go to distant places and 
when they came back they had medicines.  
 
 
And the nurses would get on horses – they weren’t really nurses: the debutantes, they 
called them nurses, but they weren’t full nurses. And they would get on horses or jeeps. 
And then they would go out to the homes, make sure people were taking their medicine; 
or if they saw somebody who they thought really did need a doctor, they would transport 
them to Lexington, or Louisville, or Cincinnati to see a doctor. 
 
 
So I contacted them and asked if they would like me to come down. (Now, I was a 
medical student, I wasn’t a doctor.) So I filled my car up with all my books every 
weekend. And on a Friday evening, I would drive down to the Frontier Nursing Home. 
And they gave me a little room downstairs that had a light bulb hanging from the ceiling.  
 
 
And I would see patients, you know? And I would refer them. I didn’t write prescriptions 
or anything, but I would refer them to the places, and I would call [ed. correction: doctors 
for help].  
 
 
The first patient I saw was a little kid who came in, he had a big tumor sticking out of his 
ear, which turned out to be a rhabdomyosarcoma. And I asked the mother how long it had 
been there, and she said, “Oh, maybe – I don’t know, two or three years it’s been there.”  
 
 
I said, “Well we need to get that out.” And she says, “Well, I don’t think it bothers him a 
whole lot.” 
 
LG: 
[Laughing] 
 
SM: 
“Well I think we need to get that out.” 
 
Physician Oral History: Stephen Minton 
Page 20 
 
 
And the second patient that I saw was a little kid, and he had no chin at all, and his ears 
turned down, and he couldn’t hear. And he ended up with Treacher Collins. And I said to 
the mother, “How do you think his looks are?” You know? “What do you think of his 
looks?” She says, “Well I think he looks just like his father.” So, I said, “Really?” She 
said, “Oh, yeah.” She goes out, you know, “Elmer! Come in here.” [Laughs] 
 
 
So, Elmer came in – he had no chin, his ears were turned down. And I said hi, and he 
goes, [screams] “What?” [Laughs] 
 
 
So, I learned a great deal down there, because every patient I saw was a learning 
opportunity. Every patient that I saw was a chance to make a difference in another 
person’s life. And I realized that was part of it, you don’t actually need to be a doctor, to 
make a difference. I’m fortunate enough to be a doctor, and I have a position of power 
where I can direct things and get things to happen.  
 
[52:40] 
 
 
But it’s part of the whole thing of treating the nurses. A lot of diagnoses come out of our 
nurses, because they feel empowered to suggest. Some places you can’t do that: nurses 
are supposed to be nurses, they’re not supposed to be the doctor. I disagree with that; I 
think it’s a team. I don’t think it’s an individual that makes the difference, I think it’s the 
team that makes the difference. 
 
 
I live up at Sundance. And because I live there, anybody who has a health condition up 
there – and there’s movie stars up there, there’s bankers up there, there’s cowboys who 
live up there – it’s a broad spectrum.  
 
 
So, I get called one day –  
 
LG: 
So, is Sundance like its own, little community? 
 
SM: 
Yeah. Sundance is a resort in the mountain owned by Robert Redford. And we have our 
own water; I’m the chairman of the North Fork Special Service District; we have our own 
fire department. It’s just a little community that’s about 25 minutes from Provo. It’s up 
on the mountain. If you saw “Jeremiah Johnson,” there’s a mountain cirque there – that’s 
Sundance, that’s the view from my bed, is that mountain. 
 
 
So, I get a call – one of my neighbors. And she said, “We have a horse, and she’s 
pregnant, and she can’t deliver: it won’t come out. Can you come over and help us?” 
 
 
So, I said, “Sure.” So, I get my little bag and I go over there. And she has a horse, and the 
horse has got a [ed. insertion: fetus in the] transverse lie, and she can’t get it out. And this 
animal is going to die, maybe she’ll die, or whatever –  
 
LG: 
Can you explain what a transverse lie is? 
 
SM: 
Yeah, instead of being with the head down, or the bum down – it’s laying across ways. 
Physician Oral History: Stephen Minton 
Page 21 
 
 
LG: 
Okay. 
 
SM: 
So, you’ve got this whole [ed. correction: fetus] that wants to come down through the 
vagina. I had no idea how far it was up to the animal from her end. But I buried my whole 
arm, and my head, trying to feel this animal up there. And I can feel it, but I can’t get my 
hand around it to get it out.  
 
 
And I am there, and I am suffocating in her vagina, trying to get this horse out. And a 
truck drives up. And a guy gets out, cowboy boots – a real cowboy gets out. And he 
comes over and he says, “My god, boy! You’re going to smother yourself in there. Let 
me show you how it’s done.” 
 
LG: 
[Laughing] 
 
[55:14] 
 
SM: 
He goes over to his truck and he gets a big chain. And he comes over, and he dives in 
there, and he puts the chain around the animal, hooks it to his truck, floors the truck and it 
rips the animal right out of her, breaks the little guy’s back – but it gets it out of the 
mother.  
 
 
He said, “They both were gonna die – you have to be brave when you do this kind of 
stuff.” And drives away. 
 
 
I’m sitting there [laughing] with my mouth open. 
 
LG: 
Wow. 
 
SM: 
Yep, yep. 
 
 
Had another – it was a famous actor in a TV series, and also big screen movies. And he 
lived next to me, and he had this beautiful Burmese mountain dog. And he calls me and 
says the dog got into a porcupine and has like 100 quills stuck in its face (eyelids, and 
everything else).  
 
 
So, I go and look at the dog. And if you start pulling – the quill gets air in the end of it 
and it forms a hook, and it just rips out when you do it, and it bleeds. So, I came to the 
hospital and got some Ketamine, and go up and give the dog Ketamine. And the 
[laughing] dog sits up and stares at the wall.  
 
 
And so, I go and cut all these little things out. It takes me like ten hours to get all these 
little quills out. We’re doing it on his kitchen table; the kitchen table is bloody by the 
time we get done. The next day I have dinner over there. We came over and he has just a 
cloth on it, and I said, “Did you clean this table?” And he says, “Nobody knows.” 
 
Physician Oral History: Stephen Minton 
Page 22 
 
LG: 
[Laughing] 
 
SM: 
“Nobody knows, don’t worry about it. Nobody knows.” 
 
 
One other story about living in Sundance and the animals. So, one of my neighbors had a 
son, and he was a ski patrol guy and he bought this beautiful German Shepherd dog, 
beautiful. And he was teaching it how to find people in avalanches. And I was the doctor, 
at the time for the avalanche, for the ski patrol – I would help them.  
 
 
So, he calls me – somebody had brought a real sled, a horse-drawn sled up to Sundance, 
which had metal runners on it. And the dog had got his leg under it, and it had just taken 
all the tissue off this dog’s leg, right on down to the bone, all the way down. And he 
called me, crying, and he said, “I have no money. I don’t have any money. And my dog – 
my beautiful dog. Will you help me?” 
 
[57:44] 
 
 
So I go to the ER, and I get a whole bunch of suture material, and equipment, some 
medications. I go up, and in his basement, with a little lightbulb hanging from the ceiling, 
I start working on this dog. And the dog would wake up and lick in the wound, you 
know?  
 
 
And the tendon is off, so I drill a hole in the bone and pull the tendon through, tie this 
through. And I said to him, you know, “You do know I’m not a surgeon, I’m a 
neonatologist: I take care of preemies.” He said, “Yes, but I know you can do this.” 
 
 
So, I do a tendon transplant, and I do this whole thing up. And I said, “I am really 
concerned your dog’s going to have an infection and the whole leg is going to fall off,” I 
mean, you know –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SM: 
The dog never got an infection, ran perfectly well, was fine.  
 
 
A human – the leg would have fallen off. But the dog licking probably was the antibiotic 
that fixed the whole thing up. 
 
LG: 
That’s amazing.  
 
SM: 
So, I have sewn the animals up there; I’ve sewn the people up, up there, who get hurt. I 
have taken care of famous movie stars’ kids who are now famous movie stars. I lived in 
the right area to have an interesting life. I was on the board of the Sundance Institute, 
when Redford created that independent – you’ve heard of the Sundance Film Festival? 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
Physician Oral History: Stephen Minton 
Page 23 
 
SM: 
Well that’s the board, and I was on that board for a while, and I had the opportunity to go 
up and watch movies being made, and participate with a lot of really interesting people. 
 
 
One day I got called that a girl had fallen down at Sundance, by the restaurant. And it 
looked like she may have had a broken arm, and would I come down and see her? 
 
 
So, I got in my car (I happened to be home, and I got in my car), and I drive down. And 
as I’m walking up, there’s this really tall guy that’s leaning over. And he looks back, and 
looks at me, and I recognize he’s Alan Alda (“Hawkeye” from “M*A*S*H”).  
 
 
I looked at him, and I said, “So, doc – what do you think the diagnosis is?” And he looks 
at me and smiles, and he says, “Well doctor, I think there’s a broken arm.” And I said, 
“Well doctor, I think you’re absolutely right! Thank you very much for the consultation.” 
And he left with that Alan Alda smile, from ear to ear. 
 
[1:00:08] 
 
LG: 
That’s awesome. 
 
SM: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
That’s so cute. 
 
SM: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Do you ever joke around with the doctors here? Like do neonatologists make fun of each 
other, or laugh with each other? 
 
SM: 
Not more than two or three times a day. 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] Can you talk a little bit about that? 
 
SM: 
If you do what we do, and you don’t have humor, you can internalize it and it becomes 
cancer – cancerous emotions. I always tell people, “When you eat food, it turns to energy 
– and you can either store it, use it, or excrete it. If you eat your emotions, it goes to 
energy, or you store it; and if you can’t excrete it in some way, it becomes a problem.” 
 
 
We excrete our emotions through humor. And so, we treat each one of us (ourselves) as if 
we’re family: we joke with each other, we tease with each other. But at the bottom of it, 
we super respect each other.  
 
 
 
Because at the end of the day, you’re going to go home and that person is going to 
continue the treatment plan that you have devised. And you the next day, are going to 
continue the treatment plan that that person devised. And babies constantly are changing; 
so, we are the eyes and ears of each other. And we tease each other all the time. And 
humor is really, really, really important.

LG: 
Can you give me a – I know it’s hard to think of, but can you think of any examples that 
you might want to share, of the banter, or the teasing, or the humor? 
 
SM: 
Oh, when someone asks a question like that –  
 
LG: 
I know –  
 
SM: 
Ten thousand things just fell on the floor, out of my brain. I’m having trouble –  
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
SM: 
Thinking about what that really, truly is. But we have people at the outlying hospitals, are 
always –  
 
[1:02:07] 
 
 
I was doing a resuscitation the other night. I am the medical director of neonatal 
telehealth for Intermountain – we have the largest telehealth program in the United States 
– about 270 cameras in 22 hospitals, okay? 
 
 
And so, I was on [ed. insertion: telehealth] the other night. And I went to a hospital to 
resuscitate a baby. And instead of putting the baby so I could see the baby, they turned 
the baby, so I’m looking up through the scrotum and the penis: that fills my entire screen, 
right? And I’m trying to subtly tell them that I need to see the chest. And so I said, “This 
is a boy, right?” 
 
LG: 
[Laughing] 
 
SM: 
“Yes, of course.” 
 
 
“Is the chest moving? I’m having trouble seeing the chest.” Finally, I had to say, “Would 
someone please get the scrotum out of my face.” 
 
LG: 
[Laughing] 
 
SM: 
Right? And everybody cracked up. And at the end, I said to the father, “I hope that you 
understand that,” –  
 
 
And he said, “Oh,” he said, “thank you doctor, because I was scared to death, and as soon 
as you said that, it relieved the stress.” 
 
LG: 
Is that why you think doctors use humor, is for stress? 
 
SM: 
I think I use humor not just to reduce stress, but I use it as a teaching technique. If you’ve 
ever heard me give a lecture, you will see me cry and laugh in almost every lecture. 
Physician Oral History: Stephen Minton 
Page 25 
 
Because I’m a storyteller; I believe people learn from stories. They can hear a lecture a 
hundred times, and it’s facts; but a story has meaning.  
 
 
And so, of course, my kids will tell you I cry at Disney movies. So –  
 
 
But I use humor in teaching. I use humor when there is a sad part, in order (not to 
minimize it) but to allow people to grow, and to get rid of it – get rid of some of the 
tension that’s there. Because if there’s too much tension, it’s hard to make a decision. So, 
I want to get it to where they’re making [ed. correction: decisions] on the facts; emotion 
is still there, all that stuff is still there, but if it gets too much –  
 
[1:04:44] 
 
 
And I will do things like this – we have to make a decision what to do with a baby, how 
do you tell a parent, “Tell me whether you want me to resuscitate your baby or not?” 
How does a parent say, “No.”? 
 
 
So, what I do is I talk to them and I say, “I understand what you want. I am going to be 
your agent. I’m going to apply what you’ve told me, and I’ll make the decision based 
upon because I know what you want.” And universally, they’ll go, “Yes, yes; do that.”  
 
 
That’s not humor, but it’s a way of how I do, to deflect things around, and try and help 
people get through really, really stressful scenarios.  
 
LG: 
You made an interesting comment about keeping emotions inside and those emotions 
becoming cancerous? 
 
SM: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
Or dangerous? 
 
SM: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
Can you talk a little bit about that? 
 
SM: 
Yeah. 
 
[Phone ringing] 
 
 
With life and death, it’s difficult. And yes, we have humor. And yes, we have 
understanding. And yes, we do huddles after serious things and try to explain what we 
did, why we did it, and allow people to cry, and allow people (this is on my own staff) to 
question and get rid of some of this.  
 
Physician Oral History: Stephen Minton 
Page 26 
 
 
But despite all that, 30% of all the nurses in my newborn ICU, when I test them, have 
severe post-traumatic stress disorder; another 30% have moderate. And if you’re in our 
unit a year, you have some element of post-traumatic stress disorder.  
 
 
Which means that you wake up at night, you remember cases, and you remember things 
that happen. Some people even have, “I don’t want to go to work” feelings. Or, a baby 
comes in, and before we even know what’s going on, they look at the baby and it reminds 
them of another baby who died, and they start to cry. 
 
[1:06:54] 
 
 
And so, we have to deal with that. And so, we often – before a baby is born, we’ll go 
through what we’re going to be doing to try and relieve that; we’ll use humor to talk 
about it.  
 
 
I’ll often say, “What is wrong with me? I feel like I’m going to cry.” And then everybody 
in the room goes, “Yeah, yeah.” And then we go, “What are we? Are we wusses? What’s 
wrong with us?” Right? Just to get it out. If you don’t get rid of that, the burnout becomes 
so much, that people will leave the field and never want to come back. Because it hurts 
too much. They can’t get it outside. 
 
 
And so we try each time to get it outside. We do that with huddles, we do that with 
discussions. I had a nurse the other night, and she and I worked on a baby. She called me 
at home, and she said, “I need to talk.” And I said, “Okay.” So, I drove back in. And I 
said, “Okay, so what is it?” She says, “I believe I screwed up on this baby. I believe the 
outcome is secondary to me.” 
 
 
“Well tell me why?” 
 
 
So, we go through it and I said, “No.” And I explained to her, “No, no; this baby had this 
two days before this baby came to you.” And we went through it, and then we started 
laughing and joking. And then she dissipated it, and then she went home. That had to 
happen. She would have gone through – this would have come back over, and over, and 
over, and over.  
 
 
I have people who have worked in our unit, who I have talked to their husband or wife, 
and they say they can’t get over this stuff; they can’t get over it. And if you can’t get over 
it, then you have to do a different job, because you have to be able to get over it – not 
completely (necessarily), but you have to handle it in some way. 
 
 
I cry about babies who die.  
 
 
I had this one patient I’m going to tell you about. One of my current partners was in his 
fellowship (at the time) in Seattle. And he came down here to do an interview, and he 
was following me for the day. And I had a baby on the floor who had a single nostril, and 
no eyes, just a single nostril, a syndrome. And it was not compatible with life.  
Physician Oral History: Stephen Minton 
Page 27 
 
 
 
And the baby had been born two days before, three days before, and I had intubated the 
baby, because the family wanted time to get to know this baby. They had seven kids at 
home, the kids came in; each one of them held – we did all this stuff. And we’d decided 
that day we were going to stop, because it wasn’t fair to the baby to just continue.  
 
[1:09:51] 
 
 
And so he’s following me. So, I’m going to show him how I deal with this. And I talk to 
the family, we did pictures: every member of the family with the [ed. correction: 
breathing tube in]. Then we took the tube out, and while the baby was still alive we took 
pictures with every member of the family, and we passed the baby around. And the heart 
rate goes down, the baby turns blue. I pronounce the baby [ed. insertion: dead]. 
 
 
We go back to the unit and I’m talking to him about how I did that, a review. And about 
45 minutes later, the nurse came and she said, “Steve, the baby is pink, breathing, and has 
a heart rate of 120.” I’ve already pronounced the baby dead, right? 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SM: 
I run down to the room with the guy following me, I go in. And the mother is sitting there 
holding the baby and she looks at me and she says, “What?! What is this?” And I said, 
“This is God giving us another opportunity for better pictures.” 
 
 
So, they passed the baby around, we took pictures for two hours, and then the baby died. 
And the mother looks at me and she says, “Are we really dead?” And I said, “Well you 
trusted me the first time, and I was wrong – I’m afraid to say! [Laughing] “Why don’t we 
hold the baby for another half an hour and see.” And then I pronounced it. 
 
LG: 
Wow. 
 
SM: 
Now that’s a form of humor, but it’s really not. That could be taken in all kinds of 
different ways. I chose to use a humorous thing, and also, it’s not something bad, it’s an 
opportunity. And the mother jumped on it, and took it. And I get Christmas cards from 
these people, “Thank you for the opportunity.” 
 
[1:11:55] 
 
LG: 
Do you think that the physicians – you mentioned the nurses tested for 30%-ish PTSD – 
do physicians test similarly? Or do you know? 
 
SM: 
I believe they do. I purposely didn’t give the PTS test to my doctors. When I mention 
this, everybody in the room shakes their head yes, they all know it. They all know that 
every one of us have it. 
 
Physician Oral History: Stephen Minton 
Page 28 
 
 
I had a baby that had a terrible bleed in its head, and its prognosis was terrible. And we 
had talked to the parents and decided that relatives from Wyoming were going to drive 
down so they could see the baby while it was alive, and then we’d take the baby off. And 
they didn’t show up in time, and so I had to leave. And one of my partners was on. And I 
was at home, and she called and she says, “I know there’s a plan, I can’t do it. I just can’t 
do that.”  
 
 
So, I drove in and I did it, and wrote the note. And then she didn’t care if I – she couldn’t 
do it; she just, in her heart, couldn’t do it.  
 
 
Usually, when something like that has happened, one of us has had an experience similar 
to it. I had a neonatologist the other night who [ed. correction: was pregnant herself with 
premature twins]– she was carrying premature twins. And she was asked to do a consult 
at the same gestational age on a woman who probably was going to deliver, and she 
didn’t want to deliver [ed. insertion: herself] at that age. And it was very difficult for her 
to go in that room, and have that discussion with that mom about –  
 
[1:14:00] 
 
LG: 
Because it’s personal. 
 
SM: 
It was so personal that she couldn’t do it. That’s what being a team is, though; we all 
cover for each other.  
 
 
In my whole time here, if I’ve really needed a day [ed. correction: to do stuff, I will say] 
to somebody, “Can you help me?” You know, I do work a lot of hours, but like my son 
(my youngest son, who is 23) – every day at three o’clock, from when he was in Junior 
Jazz for nine years, I would leave at three o’clock every day and coach his basketball 
team. And we were really good. We were really good. I taught them how to be really 
good [laughs]. 
 
LG: 
Yeah, runner dad. [Laughing] 
 
SM: 
Oh, I would – if they would burp wrong, I would say, “Oh, you’re talking back to me, 
five laps!” And I would run them. And when we’d get to the fourth quarter of a game, the 
other team’s mouth: their tongue would be hanging out, and my guys are just running 
their butts off. Because I would run them. 
 
 
To this day, if I run into one of them – these big men will come and hug me. “Hey coach! 
How are you?” 
 
LG: 
That’s cute. 
 
SM: 
Yeah. I had this one kid – he was the biggest kid on our team. And he didn’t like to be 
rough. And I didn’t have anybody as big as him. So, every day at practice, I would guard 
him. And I would push, and I would pinch, I would pound on him. And for the first year, 
Physician Oral History: Stephen Minton 
Page 29 
 
he just let me do it. We started the second year, and he said to my son, “I’m not going to 
let your dad just beat up on me every day, so I’m not going to play this year.”  
 
 
And so, I went to his house, knocked on the door and said, “Can I take Shawn out for 
dinner tonight?” So, we went out and I said, “Shawn, do you really think that I enjoy 
beating on you?” 
 
[1:16:01] 
 
 
“No.” 
 
 
“Why do you think I did that?” 
 
 
“Well you wanted to make me better.” 
 
 
And I said, “Well are you better?” And he said, “Well I guess so.” And I said, “So, you 
don’t have to play, you know, that’s fine. But I still haven’t finished my job with you.” 
 
 
He came back, he became the toughest kid in the league; he got “Most Valuable Player” 
in the league. And he would knock people around. And every time he would, he would 
sort of look over at the bench and go –  
 
[Laughter] 
 
LG: 
That’s funny. 
 
SM: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Well what else, that we haven’t really talked about, would you want people to know 
about your job, or what it’s like to be a neonatologist today? Or, with just being a doctor 
in general? 
 
SM: 
Well you know, the world has changed significantly since I started as a doctor. Many 
things are really a lot better; some things are not as good; some things are just different. 
And I don’t think we’ve evolved there yet.  
 
 
When I started, the doctor was sort of the captain of the ship, determined everything. The 
patients were subservient to the doctor as such, didn’t have ownership of their health. 
Insurances paid stuff, so you didn’t pay out of pocket. We were not cognizant of cost; it 
was like we had access to any test that you want.  
 
 
And then the legal system kicked in, and there were a lot of lawsuits. So people practiced 
defensive medicine. And so, lots of tests that didn’t need to be done, lots of cost. As a 
matter of fact, about 50% of healthcare is cost waste – we just don’t know what the 50% 
is yet. 
 
Physician Oral History: Stephen Minton 
Page 30 
 
[1:18:11] 
 
 
And now, we’re to a different world, where we’re going to be not in what we call a fee-
for-service world, we’re going to be into a value world. Every test you do should have 
value. Every treatment you do should have value; and if you believe what I just said, that 
50% of everything we do doesn’t have value, then we have to figure out what really 
works.  
 
 
Hospitals are very costly, and probably 30% of all the hospitals are going to disappear. 
We’re going to start doing care at home, telehealth; you’re going to have ownership of 
your own health. And only super-critical care will be done in a hospital; everything else 
will be done on the outside.  
 
 
Doctors are going to have to learn to delegate much better than they’ve done. They’re 
going to have to learn that you don’t have to see the patient, you can trust the patient. 
You can educate the patient, and then you can trust the patient.  
 
 
Right now, an obstetrical patient – they go to the doctor’s office, they do a blood pressure 
(and they don’t necessarily believe it, because you’re all excited and it’s a little high), and 
they get your weight – they do a whole lot of things you could do at home. And then the 
doctor talks to you a little bit. They may or may not do an ultrasound [ed. correction: for 
pregnancy].  
 
 
Most of what’s done could be done at home, and we could do a better educational process 
at home [ed. insertion: during pregnancy]. So, by the time you deliver, you already have 
all this education (and not while you’re under anesthesia) [ed. insertion: at the hospital], 
have to get all this education before you go home, and not get it. We could do things so 
much different, and that’s what the world is going to be. 
 
 
And we’re going to have reduce costs down from 19% of the gross national product to 
about 9% of the gross national product. 
 
LG: 
Healthcare is 19%? 
 
SM: 
It’s going to be done differently. And so, new people coming in are having difficulty 
knowing what to feel is going to be, in order to guess whether you really want to go into 
it or not.  
 
[1:20:15] 
 
 
Biomechanics is going to take over a whole lot different world. Nanotechnology, all 
kinds of things are going to kick in, that we don’t even do today, that is going to make 
medicine so different than what we have done.  
 
 
As far as neonatology, there are people right now that are putting stem cells down in 
babies’ lungs, in Germany, and growing new lungs. And so, everything that I have 
Physician Oral History: Stephen Minton 
Page 31 
 
worked for: all the things that I’ve helped develop – in 15 years may not be part of the 
standard of practice at all. And I’m not jealous of that, because it’ll be significantly 
better. 
 
 
But we may be doing things different. For example, when I went through [ed. insertion: 
my education], I had to learn how to listen to the heart; today, many of the doctors just 
get a chest x-ray, an EKG, and an echocardiogram, and don’t do the same kinds of 
listening. So, a lot of those skills –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
SM: 
Are gone. Is it bad? Well it’s more expensive to do it the other way; but I don’t know. 
 
I developed, about 15 years ago, doing my own ultrasounds in the unit – I use it like a 
stethoscope –  
 
LG: 
No noise [inaudible] [laughs]. Anyway? Your stethoscope? 
 
SM: 
I use ultrasound like a stethoscope. So, when I look at a baby in the morning, I look at its 
heart, the function of his heart, his blood volume, his head – his head size, his bladder 
size. What’s his liver look like? Suddenly, the rest of the country is starting to look at 
what they call POCUS (or point of care ultrasound). And in ten years, that will be the 
standard of care; but I’ve been doing it for about 15 years – I’ve done over 10,000 of 
them. Because I knew just looking from the outside wasn’t enough, you had to go inside 
and learn more about the inside of patients. So, I taught myself how to do my own 
ultrasound. 
 
 
The new machines will – well the old machine was upside-down and backwards; so, I 
saw the heart as upside-down and backwards. The new machines will invert and correct, 
but I still do my old way, because that’s how I see the heart now. 
 
LG: 
[??] 
 
SM: 
[Laughs] 
 
LG: 
What advice would you give for somebody who was thinking about doing medicine 
today? To high school students, or early college? 
 
[1:22:50] 
 
SM: 
I think it’s going to be a very interesting field down the road. But I would do a couple 
things: one, instead of taking all science and everything – I would do, in college, 
philosophy, literature. Because later on, you are so daggone busy, it’s really hard to go 
back and read some of those classic things.  
 
Physician Oral History: Stephen Minton 
Page 32 
 
 
Computer skills are going to be – you’re going to have to have fantastic computer skills. 
And (as I mentioned) biomechanical may well be the wave of the future.  
 
 
Human beings are programmed to die at about 150 years of life. We die earlier than that 
because of infectious disease, you know, environmental stuff, a lot of things. The old 
Greeks had a myth, and in that myth people were hung from a strand (they would 
dangle), and under stress the string would get shorter, shorter, and shorter, and shorter. 
And when the string disappeared you died.  
 
 
Well it turns out that the end of our chromosomes we have telomeres, which are these 
long strands; and stresses cause them to get shorter, and that causes some of your aging 
and death. There are new people working on prolonging your telomeres, or causing your 
telomeres to regenerate. 
 
LG: 
Wow. 
 
SM: 
We’re going to regenerate tissues, in the future you’re going to make your own heart, 
you’re going to make your own liver, and store it; and then when you need it, it will be 
replaced. It is scary. 
 
 
The biggest problem that I think will be faced, is we’re going to get so much material out 
of genetics; we’re going to get so much information on how we can do different things, 
that I’m not sure the human being has the ethical and moral ability to be able to make 
great decisions. We haven’t demonstrated that in many ways. And so, that may be a real 
problem for us in the future.  
 
LG: 
Okay. Well is there anything else you would like to add to your interview? 
 
SM: 
I want to tell a story about my family. 
 
LG: 
Okay. 
 
[1:25:17] 
 
SM: 
When I was young, my grandparents were born in a place called Manchester, Ohio. And 
my mother was born in Manchester, and my father was born just outside of Manchester, 
Ohio. I found out that my mother’s family (Applegates) came over from England, in the 
second wave of boats that came over from England.  
 
 
And they had property – they had come over in the 11th century, and they had property 
that went from London to the ocean. And they had orchards on it, and that’s where 
Applegates came from. But they were persecuted, and they came over to the United 
States, and they were in the colonies.  
 
 
And they ended up going to a place called Manchester, Virginia (because they came from 
Manchester, England). And in Manchester, United States, there were slaves. And they 
Physician Oral History: Stephen Minton 
Page 33 
 
were opposed to slavery. So they left and went to Manchester, Ohio – this new little 
colony in Ohio that didn’t have slavery, on the banks of the Ohio River.  
 
 
And just south of Manchester, was a city called Ripley, Ohio (again, on the banks of the 
Ohio River). And there was a little house on the hill of Ripley. And slaves would come 
from Kentucky to the river. And a guy by the name of John Rankin, who was a preacher, 
who didn’t believe – he came from Virginia as well, and he didn’t believe in slavery – 
left a little light there.  
 
 
And they would shine the light, and he would bring a boat across the Ohio River, and he 
would pick up the slaves, and he would take them back. And then he had created, up the 
hill, 100 steps. And they would go up, and he would hide them in his house there. And it 
was the beginning of the Underground Railroad. And they would get them out all the way 
to Canada then. 
 
[1:27:33] 
 
 
Well the slave owners didn’t like losing their slaves, so they hired some mercenaries. 
And these mercenaries would be on horses. And the Ohio River had not been dammed, 
and there was a place north where they could ride their horses across the Ohio River. And 
they would go across, and they realized that John Rankin was hiding these slaves.  
 
 
So one night a female slave came across, and they were going to get her (there were six 
of them). They were on horses. And so, they went across the river, they came down to his 
house, and they were outside the house and they had their guns. And they said, “We want 
the slave.” And John Rankin said, “There are no slaves in here, there are only free 
people.” And they said, “If you don’t come out, we will shoot.” So, he came out and they 
said, “We want the slave.” 
 
 
Well John Rankin had built (behind the big fireplace) a little room that he would hide the 
slaves in – they could go down through the cellar, and up the back and hide behind the 
fireplace there. So, there was a slave in there – he was on the porch. So, he looked at him 
and he said, “I have six sons and they’re in the woods behind you, and they each have a 
rifle and they’re pointed at your heads. You can kill me,” –  
 
[Phone ringing] 
 
 
“But before I hit the ground, they will blow your heads off.” And they left. And actually, 
he did have six sons, and they were in the woods, and they would have blown their heads 
off –  
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
But he would have been dead. And so he continued to do that.  
 
Physician Oral History: Stephen Minton 
Page 34 
 
 
Eventually, slavery was abolished, the Underground Railroad disappeared. And 
eventually, my father’s family bought the Rankin house and lived there for a while. In 
fact, currently (today) it has about five pieces of furniture that came from my dad’s 
family. And it is now a National Monument.  
 
[1:29:41] 
 
 
But when I was little, it was still owned by my dad’s family, and it was decrepit. And I 
would run the steps, and I was fast. And so I would bet all the local kids that I could beat 
the up the 100 steps for a dollar. And I made a lot of money running up the steps, I never 
was beaten running up the steps to the Rankin house. And I would play in the little room 
behind the fireplace.  
 
 
Eventually, it was sold and it became a National Monument. And Oprah Winfrey came to 
Cincinnati and built a museum to the Underground Railroad. And about two years after 
she built it, I went back to see my mother. And my mother wanted to go to the museum. 
And my mother was a storyteller as well.  
 
 
And so we went to see it, and they have a movie in it. And they were talking about the 
history of the Rankin House in the movie. And my mother goes, “That’s not true! That 
piece of furniture wasn’t in the Rankin House! That came from my mother’s house, and 
when your dad and I got married I moved that over there.”  
 
 
And suddenly, the people there realized that this woman knew something about the 
Rankin House. So all of a sudden, my mother is standing up there: blind and deaf, telling 
the story of the Rankin House. And all of the employees were sitting on the floor around 
her.  
 
 
And then they said they were going to call Oprah and let her know the real story, and 
probably Oprah would want to talk to my mother. And then my mother had a cardiac 
arrhythmia, and I had to bring her to Utah. So, she never got an opportunity to talk to 
Oprah. 
 
 
But my family, actually, at one point in time, owned the Rankin House – they were not 
John Rankin’s family, but they owned the Rankin House. And I played in it as a child. 
 
LG: 
That is really cool. Next time I go to Cincinnati, I’m going to go see it. 
 
[1:31:43] 
 
SM: 
Oh, oh. You have to go see the Rankin – and you have to walk the steps. 
 
LG: 
I’m going to; I will do it huffing and puffing [laughs].

SM: 
Yeah. About halfway up, there’s a rock that’s tilted to the side – and I knew that, and 
that’s where I would take everybody. Because I would get in front and go to the one side, 
and they’d go to the other side and slide off the rock. And I would – [laughs] 
 
LG: 
[Inaudible] 
 
SM: 
I’d have to beat them, right? 
 
LG: 
Okay. Is there anything else you’d like to record or say? 
 
SM: 
No, I feel honored to have been a physician. I feel honored to have been at this place.  
 
 
The one thing that I will say is I’m now 74 and I’m not done. I probably am going to 
change my focus a little bit. I have a ventilator that’s now been submitted to the FDA for 
approval. We can make it for $420, and I’m going to take it around the world for poor 
countries to help their newborns; instead of a $10,000 ventilator, they can get a $420 
ventilator for their babies.  
 
 
And so, I’m probably going to shift and do some global health. Because my wife has 
already told me that if I’m at home, redesigning the home any more, she would have to 
hurt me. 
 
LG: 
[Laughing] 
 
 
Well I think that’s a good place to stop. 
 
SM: 
[Laughs] That was a joke. 
 
LG: 
I know. 
 
SM: 
Oh, good. 
 
LG: 
Always. 
 
SM: 
[Laughs] 
 
LG: 
Alright. Well, thank you so much, it was really a pleasure talking to you. 
 
 
Again, my name is Lisa Gabbert; and I’ve been interviewing Dr. Stephen Minton, who is 
the medical director of the NICU here, at Intermountain Utah Valley Hospital, in Provo, 
Utah. And today is November 5th, 2019. 
 
 
So, thanks again. 
 
SM: 
My pleasure.
