Last Night as I Lay on My Pillow
LAST NIGHT AS I LAY ON MY PILLOW
Rosetta Spainhard Arvin, 1940
Last night as I lay on my pillow, Last night as I lay on my bed, Last night as I lay on my
pillow, I dreamed that my Bonnie was dead.
Let her go, let her go, god bless her, For she's mine where ever she may be She may
ramble this wide world over But she'll never find a Friend like me.
She may travel by boats on the ocean She may travel by ships on the sea She may
ramble this wide world over But she'll never find a Friend like me.
I went to church last Sunday, I saw my old true love there I could tell that her mind was
changing By the way that she done up her hair.
