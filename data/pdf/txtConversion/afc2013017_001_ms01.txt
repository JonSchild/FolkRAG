Bryan Hop Interview Index 
00:00:00  
Sept 12 2014 in New Richmond, talking with Bryan Hop. Born in New 
Richmond, Wisconsin in 1966. Ethnicity brought out more on his mom’s side, where one parent 
was 100% Irish and one 100% Norwegian. Norwegian side was taken in more than the Irish side, 
by uncles. For Bryan, he can’t think of any Norwegian traditions he’s kept up, has kept a few of 
the Irish ones. In 1985 Bryan graduated from high school, then attended University of Minnesota 
for 3-4 years. He picked up a part time job while a student, and liked making money so went to 
full time and was away from school for a few years. Met his future wife at St. Mary’s Hospital, 
and while they were engaged he ended up finishing his bachelor’s degree at Concordia College 
in St. Paul, a business degree. Stayed in health care a few more years. Wife is from River Falls. 
They envisioned moving to a smaller town. They were camping one weekend when Bryan got a 
call from his mom that a house in his old neighborhood was for sale. They had been living in 
White Bear Lake. On a whim, they took a look at the house in New Richmond, fell in love with 
it and made an offer. They both had jobs in the Twin Cities, so drove from New Richmond to St. 
Louis Park and Edina. On a good day with no traffic, the commute was an hour plus. In the 
winter it was double to triple that commute.  
00:05:24   
His wife was a physical therapist and after a while got a job at the hospital in New 
Richmond. Bryan still commuted to St. Paul, still working in the health field. They were having 
kids, and by the time their second son was born Bryan got a job in New Richmond, selling cars. 
That way he could spend less time on the road and be with family. That was for about five and a 
half years, then moved into finance there. He wanted something different, so he called a friend 
who used to be a teacher who advised him to talk to people at River Falls. He then went to 
graduate school in education at University of Wisconsin-River Falls, since he already had a 
bachelor’s degree. It has worked out really well. Did some subbing while he was in school, 
which cemented things for him. This was really what he wanted to do as a career. This was 
around 2001-2002. He went to school at night, took summer classes. It was interesting going 
back to school at that time of his life; he was much more focused, got more out of the classes. He 
still takes classes for professional development, and enjoys it more and more. 
00:10:50  
He interviewed at a few schools. New Richmond was the third school he 
interviewed at, and it worked out, he started that fall. Principal called him on a Friday and said 
“I’ve got good news and bad news. The good news is we’d like to offer you a position as a 7th 
grade math teacher. The bad news is that the rest of the team is going to Madison on Monday for 
a week to learn the new curriculum.” Bryan said, let’s do it, and he went to Madison with the 
whole math team in middle school. That was fun. They studied “Math in Context” created in 
Madison, so they had some of the authors of the curriculum teaching the team. They were there 
four days. There were teachers from other districts too, about 20-30 people. This was 2006. 
Bryan taught math for one year. His goal was to teach 4th grade. He ended up teaching 4th grade 
the next year at Paperjack Elementary (now East) for one year, and has taught 4th grade ever 
since, in this school once it opened. 
00:14:14  
In New Richmond, after the first year he taught, there was a referendum to 
finance building new schools, a new high school and new elementary school, plus refurbishing 
the other schools. The high school was old and outdated, they had supplementary temporary 
buildings, and

people saw the need to update, so the referendum passed—not by a landslide, but was one of the 
biggest in the state that year. It made state headlines, that a small community like New 
Richmond would spend so much money on its school system. They went to a community school 
model, so that each elementary school would have k-5 classes. So the staff got split up; at the 
time, 4th and 5th grade had been at the intermediate school, Paperjack, so that was a change for a 
lot of people. The principals set up the different teams, and figured out how many kids were 
going to be at each school. New Richmond isn’t that big—at that time, about 7500. All three of 
these schools were within a mile of each other, not like bigger communities where they’d be 
schools at opposite ends of town. So, it all had to be figured out by culture, lay of the land. Bryan 
has been at Hillside ever since it was built. Last year, they saw their first kids graduate from 5th 
grade who started at the school when it was opened. 
00:17:40  
There are different teams at the school. There is the school team, and there are 
grade teams. Hillside has three wings. C wing is 4th and 5th. 4th grade classes do some things with 
the 5th grade classes, but it’s kind of tough because their schedules are so difficult. Try to meet as 
often as possible. At beginning of school year, meet in small batches but as year goes on, meet 
more often. There are four 4th grade teachers. This year, that includes two who are new to 
teaching. Exciting and interesting. Lot of ideas, willingness to jump in. Once a month, they have 
an early out, and students get out a couple of hours early and the 4th grade team meets. The team 
leader sends out the agenda. Typically they talk about something they all share, like new 
curriculum or learning goals. Talk about what’s working in language and math. Each meeting is 
a little bit different. 
00:21:24  
Independent in own classroom? Yes and no. A fieldtrip coming up, where the 4th 
grade classes will do things as a group. On early out days, last year they started something new, 
having kids do something unusual or more new so that they are interested, not business as usual. 
This year Bryan has students asking “What are we doing on early out day?” They never asked 
that before. It used to be a hectic afternoon, but now each of the four 4th grade teachers comes up 
with a subject within a subject. Next week, they’ll talk about rocks and minerals to help prepare 
for a field trip to Interstate Park, to study effects of glacier there. Preparing like that helps 
comprehension when the students are on site. Much deeper conversations. Made the field trip last 
year much more relevant. With this model, as each 4th grade teacher prepares their subject, they 
rotate the kids, which allows each teacher to be a more expert in a subject and also get to know 
the other classes. Bryan loves meeting all the kids even before they come to 4th grade. Then they 
can know more about Bryan too—that he lives in Wisconsin but likes the Vikings. That he is a 
rockhound. It starts conversations. With the community school, you can get to know not only the 
kiddos but their siblings and families. 
00:26:45  
To rotate the kids: they have their own kids go through the lesson for the first 
time, to work out kinks. There are two learning stations in the morning and two in the afternoon. 
They travel to the other classrooms; they get to see different classrooms that way. Bryan likes to 
mix it up a little bit. Some teachers are more comfortable with that than others. It can change 
every year. 
00:29:10  
A typical day: 7:40 is the start of the day. New Richmond has a “split start.” For 
middle school and high school, the bell rings at 7:30 and they start at 7:40. For elementary, they 
start at

8:40.  Bell rings at 8:30 and they are expected to be in the room at 8:40. In the middle school, 
they have about eight to ten periods. When the bell rings, people go to a different class. But at 
elementary level, each year it changes because the numbers fluctuate so much. The biggest 
number of students in a classroom is 30. The lowest Bryan has had is 23, which seems more 
roomy—fewer tests to grade. This year he started with 25, everyone else on the team had 24. By 
the first or second day of school, everyone had 25. His first hour at school is a prep hour, can 
meet with other teachers or parents. Have staff meetings once a week. Bryan has a special right 
away, at 8:45 so right away has to get kids to the special. The school is on a six day cycle, rather 
than Monday through Friday, so some specials can also be on that six day cycle. But Phy Ed is 
every other day, on the even days, 2, 4 and 6. Art is two days a cycle, music is two days a cycle, 
media center (library) one day a cycle, and then Guidance is every other Day 6. This allows them 
to organize specials in a more orderly fashion. The six day cycle helps accommodate the 
vacation days (like Labor Day on Monday) which evens things out for all the classes. While the 
middle school has a ten period day, the elementary school sometimes hasn’t ironed out its 
schedule. For example, this is the third week of school and they just changed the lunch hour. It’s 
kind of a fluid schedule from one year to the next. 
00:35:35  
Specials are 35 minutes long. This year Bryan has two specials in the morning, so 
they come to his room, leave for the special for 35 minutes, come back for about 15 minutes, 
then the next special. A little tough to get a whole lot done, but once the machine gets moving, 
they’ll get more done. He has a 15 minute block for English language arts. Coming back from 
the second special, Phy E, they finish up the English language arts. One change has been to have 
recess before lunch; Bryan has found that the kids eat healthier if they have had recess first. 
Before, they had recess on their mind so they wouldn’t eat well—they just wanted to get outside 
and play. Now, they are outside first and come in hungrier and fill up with more vegetable and 
fruit choices. Now all schools offer breakfast. In Bryan’s day, if you didn’t have breakfast you 
didn’t have breakfast. You can tell the difference if kids come to school hungry. How can you 
teach them if all they can think of is an empty stomach? In this community, it’s a mix of some 
parents not being able to afford to feed their kids, and other parents because of their work 
schedule not having time to fix breakfast for their kids. Maybe the percentage is rising of parents 
who can’t afford to feed their kids a solid meal in the morning. Used to talk about free lunch, but 
now a good amount of free breakfast too. Bryan amazed at how low the price of meals is, they 
try to keep it under $2 a meal. Adults can come in to eat with the kids, and pay a little more, 
about $3 a meal. Bryan amazed at the quality of the fruit and vegetables the school can bring in. 
It seems off topic, but it is all connected to teaching—kiddos’ schedules, having a decent meal, 
riding on the bus or being dropped off. 
00:41:55  
Bryan has the same schedule every day, once the details are ironed out. The first 
four days, Bryan likes to introduce the schedule a little more each day, as kids coming off 
summer vacation. Morning taken up by language arts, reading, math and social studies in the 
afternoon. The school wants teachers to keep the timeframes the same for the subjects, but there 
is a little bit of leeway. By the second week, the kids know where they are supposed to be at 
what time. “I wish they knew better the schedule for some of the other subjects, but they really 
know recess. That one is the first to lock in.” At end of day, they have two bus runs. The first is 
at 3:40 and the second is at 3:50. Teachers there until 4 pm. Scheduled teacher day ends at 4:10. 
For the last two years, with bad winters and snow days, they have tacked a few minutes on to the 
end of the day

to make up the time they lose. Schools need to fulfill 100 days of school, so administrators last 
year figured they could add 3 minutes a day to meet that requirement. It all depends on the 
school. One year they did away with early outs and that made up for a full day. Other years they 
did away with service days. In the past, it was more snow days, but the last two years it was cold 
days, 30 to 40 below. 
00:46:55  
Bryan typically brings home work most days. He talks with the new teachers 
about what they are bringing home. It’s a matter of priority; when you take home work, there is 
something you can’t do at home. They have stuff on Google drive now, so they can do a lot more 
at home these days. That’s both good and bad. Bryan could be at school 2-3 extra hours a night. 
But with sporting events and special activities, he has some flexibility of work he can do at 
home. At his school, he can get in 24 hours a day, to use a computer or something. Bryan is kind 
of a night owl, so he can come in to work at 6, 7 10 o’clock. Once in a while he can see other 
people here at school. He joshes with custodians; sometimes they leave before he does: 
“Remember the alarm is on!” 
00:50:30  
Lots of stuff in Bryan’s classroom. He’s probably breeching the fire code in 
multiple places in his classroom. His principal likes things very neat. About two years ago, he 
kidded Bryan, “Have you ever stood outside your door and wondered why there was so much 
stuff in there?” And Bryan kids back, saying that he has noticed there are suspended ceilings—
couldn’t he store more stuff up there?  “No! You can’t!” Bryan says, at least I could put posters 
on the ceiling, it’s uncharted territory. “You can’t put posters on the ceiling! It’s against fire 
code!” Bryan likes to hang things from the ceiling, bring things in. Last summer he tried oysters 
for the first time and so he brought one in to show kids that even at his age, he can try new 
things. He gets stuff from thrift stores and other places. His neighbor’s husband was a science 
teacher, and she brought over a stuffed baby crocodile for Bryan which he keeps on his 
computer. Bryan has a spot on his desk where every week he puts out different things, that they 
can handle, grab and talk about. Skulls, shark teeth. He has a beaver skull, and he won’t tell them 
what it is, they have to figure it out. His principal says he has to stop, but he says he is still in the 
pre hoarding stage. He can still walk around, he doesn’t have to make trails. 
00:54:40  
Do teachers have specialized vocabulary?  Some of the acronyms. A friend of 
Bryan’s who is also a teacher said, you know what they call us, right? Elementarians. It’s a 
different world, the terms and vocabulary they do use. He has friends where one is a teacher and 
one is not, and if they start talking about teaching, the non-teachers ask, what in the world is 
going on? What does that mean? Bryan has been talking to the two new teachers and reflecting 
on how nice it is that there are no two days that will ever be alike, and there is no way to define 
what you do in a day. How can a teacher describe what they do? This week, Bryan has a student 
who is late for appointments, a few going home with fever from an early fall flu, he is struggling 
with a lice problem in the classroom. You never know what’s going to happen. It’s one of the 
beauties. Bryan recognizes that some teachers have words or phrases they use to keep kids from 
knowing what they are talking about. For example, teachers here talk about their “poetry 
readings” which is going out to socialize. Bryan would like to go, but they are often on 
Thursdays when his kids have events. Bryan also makes a joke that between truckers and 
teachers, he doesn’t know who has to delay going to the bathroom more. He says to the kids, 
“I’ll be right back, I have to go to my other office.” Some catch on, some don’t.  Another 
example is the teachers’ lounge. Kids

always wonder what is going on in there. Is there pop in the fridge? Candy for sale? It was 
always a mystery for Bryan too when he was in elementary school.  
00:59:30  
Lunches fluctuate for Bryan, depending on how much he has to get ready. This 
year he is trying to sit with the two new teachers a few times a week. He feels he has a support 
system here at school. His team has changed in recent years. People haven’t retired or left the 
school, but taken different positions, like reading specialist, interventionist, all good things. 
There is a positive attitude. Whatever goes on with the legislature, in the state, the teachers still 
are there; their goals haven’t changed; their reasons for being there haven’t changed. Bryan 
appreciates his principal, parents are supportive. One of the joys of teaching is getting to know 
the parents and other siblings. Bryan has been on WTLC’s cultural tours and two things come to 
mind. He remembers the one about invasive species, the discussion of red bellied crayfish. He 
and his daughter already were crayfish hunters, but after the tour he found a way to build that 
into his curriculum. His principal allowed him to take part of the day to introduce the kids to 
parks in the community, and teach them about invasive species. Then the other classes heard 
about it and they wanted to take part in it too. So all the kids learned about the parks, also that 
they were free and a healthy, and they started to pay attention to the litter problem which 
changed their personal behavior. On Earth Day, he talks about aquatic invasive species and 
plants, and introduces kids to those problems. He asks who goes fishing? Then talks about the 
need to sanitize boats and not dump bait into water. So, their education doesn’t just have to be 
things they read about but things that involve them too. Because Bryan has ties to New 
Richmond—and not everyone will stay here—but if they can become stewards of the land here, 
then wherever they go they will be stewards. Bryan loves the community feel. He talks to the 
students from Day One—first, the community of Wing C, then the school, then New Richmond, 
then Wisconsin. He wants them to recognize those connections.
