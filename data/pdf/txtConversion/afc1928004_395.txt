On ! fancy brings a 
thought to me 
Of flowers sweet and rare, 
With grace and beauty there combined, 
And brightest hues so fair— 
SG 
like a 
maiden that I 
loved— 
It was my happy lot: 
I 
whispered when we parted last— 
' 
Oh I 
you'll forget me not! " 
CHORUS. 
Graceful and as charming as a 
lily in the pond— 
Time has passed so swiftly—for, of her I 
am so fond— 
Dasies and the roses, too, they grow around the spot 
Where we parted and I 
whispered— 
" 
You'll forget me not! " 
(Dance.) 
We met—h 
really don't know where— 
But still ' tis all the same— 
For love walks in the busy streets 
As well as in the lane: 
I 
gently pressed her tiny band: 
She glanced at me a 
shot— 
She dropped a 
flower, I 
picked it up— 
A sweet forget-me-not I 
(Chorus and Dance.) 
At last there came a 
happy day 
And something that I 
said 
Just caused her lips to murmur " yes!" 
And shortly we were wed. 
A 
little cottage by the brook, 
And, a 
tiny garden spot 
Where grows a 
little flower called— 
A sweet forget-me-not! 
(Chorus and Dance.) 
"POOR OLD UNCLE TOME" 
Written and composed by W. J. GROGAN, and sung by him 
with great success in his sketch, " Uncle Tom's Return." 
MY 
joyous days have passed away, 
For me there's no more rest; 
In Heaven's home soon I 
will be 
Amongst the innocent and blest, 
With angels bright in robes so white 
To protect and guide me on. 
There's a 
laurel now awaits the brow 
Of poor old, feeble Uncle Tom. 
Cnonus. 
No friend, no home, I'm left alone; 
To my grave I'm journeying on. 
Who will care, or shed a 
tear 
For poor old, feeble Uncle Tom? 
My wife and children, far apa/t, 
In some distant spot this world they roam, 
Or the good lamb granted their desire 
And their spirits away to heaven have flown. 
When my bones lay beneath the clay, 
And this sheep to his shepherd has gone; 
When you kneel to pray, a 
prayer then say 
For poor old, feeble Uncle Tom. 
Cuonus. 
When my bones lay beneath the clay, 
And this sheep to his shepherd has gone; 
When at prayer you kneel, a 
prayer then yield 
For poor old, feeble Uncle Tom. 
GOOD-BY, PAPA DEAR, GOOD-BY! 
Copyright, A. J. FISHER, 1878. 
Words and music by W. J. 
GROGAN. 
PAPA, dear, come sit by Willie, 
Said a 
little dying boy, 
I 
have not long to be with you 
Ere I 
pass to peace and joy. 
His father hastened to his bedside 
And fondly his little forehead pressed; 
Death, he found, was fast approaching, 
And soon his boy would be at rest. 
Cuoncs. 
Farewell. papa, I 
mot 
leave you! 
When I'm gene don't weep or sigh; 
Do not let this parting grieve you. 
Good- by, papa dear, good-by! 
In my visions I 
see mamma 
'Midst angels beautiful and bright, 
In robes of kadianee and splendor 
Watching o'er my bed at night. 
When your darling boy has left you, 
Let me neier cause you grief or pain; 
Though on earth we both be parted, 
We 
shall meet in heaven again. 
Farewell, papa, 
Oh. papa, I 
see little angels, 
With my crown their coming nigh': 
His father smoothed back his curly locks, 
Uttered naught, but gave a 
sigh. 
Reclining with his face towards heaven, 
He placed his hands across his breast; 
He offered up a 
dying prayer, 
And passed to happiness and rest. 
Farewell, papa, ere;

AGAIN.

W AY down in dear old Charleston, in South Carolina State, 
In that dear old spot we passed our happiest days. 
It's there we had a 
home that we once called our own, 
But on that old home we never more shall gaze. 
We together often sat in the doorway of our cot, 
A 
listening to the niggers in the cane; 
But now we're left alone this wide world for to roam, 
For we'll never see that good old home again. 
CHORUS. 
Then give me this old wife, who is my joy through life; 
I'll comfort her in sorrow or in pain. 
Oh, it's often we regret, and try hard to forget, 
That good old home we'1,1 never see aaain • 
In this home we loved so well we with happiness did dwell 
But, alas! each one soon bore a 
heavy heart, 
For a 
cloud soon overspread and hovered overhead, 
Which caused our happy family to'part. 
Old massa and old missa to the angels they have gone, 
In happiness and bliss there to remain; 
While we are quite forlorn, and left here for to mourn 
For that good old home well never see again. 
Then give me this old wife, etc. 
The colored folks' delight was on a 
summer's night 
To sing and dance for hours upon the green; 
We those old hoofs could shake, when a " walking fordat 
cake," 
Though we think sometimes the past was but a 
dream. 
Now that we're turning gray, and soon must pass away, 
As in youth, together in old age remain 
Until the day does come that our work on earth is done; 
We'll think no more of that good old home again. 
Then give me this old wife, etc.

W E 
are four dissipated tramps, 
And that you plainly see; 
We came all the way from Buffalo 
A week ago to day. 
We worked our way upon the cars, 
For money we hadn't a 
dime, 
Until we reached this city 
And our comrades here did join. 
Caonns. 
Now don't sneer at us when we pass, 
Or say there goes a 
stager! 
Although we're victims of the keg, 
You'll find far worse than " Gaugers." 
This world owes us a 
living, 
And we'll have it to a 
man! 
So lgt no one despise us 
Because we carry a 
can. 
There's a 
branch that " carries the banner," 
That branch is called V. G.; 
But we're delegates from the " Gaugers," 
Which is far above that degree. 
We go our rounds within our bounds, 
So give us the respect we're due. 
We never go around singingr," hard up," 
Or " The faded coat of blue." 
Now don't sneer, etc. 
Bad scran to the " five-cent schooners," 
But it's them we do disdain! 
Since the first day they were introduced 
In the kegs there's not a 
drain! 
But below we turn the corner 
We'll fill our cans, we'll wager, 
A.nd drink the health of " The Hard-up Club," 
And of our fellow " Gaugers."

Now don't sneer, etc.]

" 
THE MEN THAT CARRY THE BANNER." 
Words and music by W. J. GROGAN. 
Originally performed by GROGAN AND FARRELL. 
On, just condescend to listen 
While our musings we express, 
And tell the trials and troubles 
Of us poor men in d:stress. 
You see depicted on our face 
The hard life that we live! 
We go out at night requesting aid 
Of those so good to give. 
CHORUS. 
We are not much inclined to work, 
Though we at it long did tarry 
Until dissipation made us quit, 
Then " The Banner we did carry." 
We often with hunger are ailing, 
And our frame with the cold we shrug, 
So don't treat with scorn the poor and forlorn, 
The men of the Hard- up Club. 
To carry the banner it's a 
terrible life, 
Oh, it's feelingly we speak; 
Its broke many a 
constitution down, 
And left a 
strong man weak. 
Our ranks are filling rapidly 
With men of all nations and trades; 
When financially embarrassed 
They fly to as for aid, 
9 
Cnonrs_ 
We're very often at a 
loss 
To know where we'll repose; 
When we've no money for a 
doss, 
In some tenement we doze. 
Then the police kick and beat us 
Until our back with pain we rub! 
That's the greeting in the morning 
For the men of the Hard-up Club. 
Some call us " Sons of Chronic!" 
They this title on us confer, 
And say we'd make good lawyers, 
We've such practice at the bar! 
We have often drink's temptation--
Tried quite hard to resist, 
And often forced, for want of food, 
On spirits to exist! 
CHORUS. 
Each man has got his failing, 
But our failing we regret; 
Through degradation and dissipation 
We're sinking step by step! 
So. young men, in time take warning, 
And our advice don't snub, 
Or some future day, to your dismay, 
You'll be enrolled in the Hard-up Club!

MiLiie published by Koppitz, Prufer S.; Co. Boston. 
I've just come from the garden there. 
A. charming place to see, 
The flowers do seen t 
the air, 
That's plain enough to me. 
For they are tended by a 
maid 
So lovely and so nir, 
The lily's around have always said 
With her none can compare. 
Crionts. 
Oh, I'm just as gay as a 
hollyhock there, 
Over in yonder garden, 
'Cause to you 1 
do declare 
I'll be married Sunday morning. 
Her father gave her all the care 
Of the house and garden, d'ye see, 
And now she's promised just out there 
To come take care otlibte. 
She is not rich, nor very poor, 
To the world I 
can proclain:, 
She's to be mine for evermore, 
Which is my heart's fond aim. 
Chorus, 
The Holly-hock stalks its head up there, 
And is pretty for to view, 
But the loveliest flower growing there 
Cannot come up to Sue. 
I've a 
modest little hous-2, and lot 
Where she will dwell with me, 
Row happy we'll be in this cot, 
I 
hope you'll come and see. 
Chorus. 
AS sweet as the rose is she, 
So charming in form and in pace, 
Her eyes they have pierced my heat t 
through, 
And I 
constantly dream of her face. 
Ile voice is as clear as the lark, 
That sings with the rising of the day, 
Iler breath is as fragrant and sweet 
As the white blossomed flowers of May. 
CHORUS. 
As sweet as the rose is she, 
Her eyes they sparkle bright, 
Fairer than all to me, I 
think of her day and nigl.t 
There's none in this world so wide, 
Could be the same to me, 
As the girl I'd call my bride, 
As sweet as a 
rose is she. 
fs.s sweet as a 
rose is she, 
The girl who has won all my love, 
I'd willingly sittcrifice life, 
To call her my own turtle dove. 
But she laughs in my face when I 
speak, 
And when I 
make love says - I 
iian't," 
Then tells m c 
I 
must her forget, 
And I 
would, but then really I 
can't, 
As sweet as the rose, &c. 
As sweet as a 
rose is she, 
The girl for whese hand I 
have sighed, 
The wealth of the world I 
would give, 
If only to call her my bride. 
I 
hone I 
may .
y(t win her hand, 
That would make me so happy for Ile, 
If I 
do, when I 
meet you again, 
Then, perhaps I 
will show you my wife, 
As sweet as the rose, &c.

SALLY, 
As sung by SANFORD & W ILSON. 
OH, here we are hind friends to-night, to sing you a 
little ditt, 
We have just arrived in town to-day and are strangers in the 
city, 
A 
la mode a 
chuck soup in the corner of the alley. 
I 
will tell you about a 
scrape I 
had along with old Aunt Sally' 
CIIORUS.

politician, 
She baits her hook with bread and cheese and can beat the 
devil for fishing, 
She can dance a 
hornpipe, flee], or a 
jig with any in this town, 
sirs, 
She can kick an ear of any man that weighs three hundred 
pounds sirs. 
Now we must bid you all good night, as our little song is 
ended, 
And what we both have said to-night, I 
hope you're not 
offended, 
If you ever want to see us again, just call for Jim and Sally, 
You will always find us both a 
hanging around de corner in 
Tin Pot Alley. 
Sady I 
will, (sc. 
I 
lead a 
quiet sort of life, ; 
But still am rather gay, 
And always ready with a 
song 
To pass the time away, 
I'll do my best to please you, 
With my little bit of rhyme, 
And prove for your amusement that 
I 
always am on time. 
Always on time, always on time, 
Exact to the minute, I'm always on time ; 
Always on time, always on time, 
Exact to the minute, I'm always on time. 
I 
had some business out of town, 
I 
could not well delay, 
And found there %v as but one more [
rain, 
To take nie there that day. 
I 
quickly rushed, I 
caught the train, 
And as the steps did climb, 
The conductor said, by Jove, young man, 
You're in luck, your just on time. 
Always on time, etc. 
The other day I 
heard a 
voice, 
That whispered in my ear, 
You'd better take your money out 
That bank, it's very queer. 
That was enough, without delay 
I 
drew out every dime, 
They suspended before noon, 
Once more, I 
was on time. 
Always on time, etc.

BEAUTIFUL BLUE BELLS. 
Words and Music by W. H. DzLEHArrry. 
Beautiful blue bells, wet with morning dew, 
Emblems of you, dear, fair and pure, and true— 
Proofs of affection which I 
feel for you— 
Beautiful blue bells, wet with morning dew. 
That's the sweet epistle which I 
sent to-day 
To my little Sweetheart, Annie, o'er the way. 
Then there came an answer, loving, kind and true— 
Thanks for those sweet posies, blue bells wet with dew 
Cnonus. 
That's the way I 
won her. 
It is, upon my honor. 
My life is blissful since I 
sent, to- day, 
Those pretty flowers to Annie, o'er the way. 
But she is sweeter, fairer, far than you, 
Beautiful blue bells, wet with morning dew. 
[Symph] 
[Symphy. 
Now, every evening you can find me there, 
In that Iitt13 cottage with my love so fair, 
Wooing and cooing like two little does— 
Pleasure pursuing, while exchanging loves. 
Then if you had seen her sitting by my side, 
When I 
asked the question, " Will you be my bride V-
How she blushed and trembled, and her eyes so blue, 
Looked just like those flowers, blue bells wet with dew.

BANJO SOLO. 
As sung by ANDY COLLOM, at TONY PASTOR'S, B'Way, N. Y. 
There was a 
young man who never had his health, 
He was subject to all kinds of ills ; 
He went down in town on Sunday afternoon, 
And bought a 
box of Vegetable Pills. 
He took twenty-six, and then he went to bed, 
And soon he was fast asleep 
And to his surprise when ho open'd up his eyes, 
He was turned to a 
big dead-beat. 
S ON. — That's the reason, Ladies and Gentlemen, you 
should never partake of those luxuries commonly called 
Vegetable Pills— 
Cnonus. 
For if you do, surely you'l rue it, 
Though strange to you it seems, 
For how funny you would look, all strunz, upon a 
hock, 
And all turned into beans. 
The old woman was taken with a 
pain in her head, 
And she sent for her darling Lou ; 
She says, go bring me that same box of pills, 
And I 
think I 
shall try some too. 
But the pills made her worse, when she sent for the nurse ; 
After taking in a 
great big number, 
When she look'd in the glass she was just as green as grass, 
She had turned to a 
big cucumber! 
For if you do, &c. 
Now the old pussie cat was looking for a 
rat, 
When she spied that box of pills ; 
She was looking all around when she gobbl'd them down, 
She thought they would cure all her ills ; 
But then the fun begun when the cat began to run 
From the cellar clear up to the garret ; 
And her body it turned to a

And her tail it turned into a

THE BOOT BLACK'S STORY. 
Written by BURT W AYNE. Dedicated to 31-NFORD J; 
WILSON. 
NOW, Mister, you're mistaken ; that wasn't any fight, 
That boy what had the cap on—we calls him flunkey White, 
I've half a 
mind to tell you about the tricks we use 
To ' tract the public ' tention an' get to blacken shoes. 
You see we watch the corners for some nice lookin' chap, 
Then " Hunkey" he comes up, and gives my head a 
rap; 
And I 
just stands and takes it until the man comes nigh, 
Then Hunkey cuts and leaves me—and I 
begin to cry. 
Its just our advertisement—it doesn't always pay— 
Sometimes I 
gets a 
customer just as I 
done to- day ; 
Ihere now, your boots are blacked—a 
dime ' 11 make it right, 
My stars, sir, that's a 
quarter—just right for the theatre to-
night. 
You want to hear ray story—I 
haven't none to tell, 
I'm just like all bootblaeks, sir, I 
blacks ' em mighty well. 
Well, new, seems kind o' funny to hear you talk to me, 
I'm just a 
ragged bootblack, and dirty as you see. 
You don't mind if folks see you—you're what I 
calls a 
brick, 
I'd like to have you see, sir, the home of this ere chick; 
Look out ! there goes your hat, sr, yer has to s.00p low, 
And just behind them barrels is where we has to go. 
Well, now I 
calls this Bunkum if lisn't scrumptious clean, 
That little pile you see, there, belongs to Dwarfy Green. 
It's us that runs this shanty—there used to be two more, 
But one got tuk to prison, and Vother died before; 
You want to:hear about ' em; well, ' twon't take long to tell. 
'Twits mighty cold last Winter, and none of us was well; 
It wasn't—what d'ye call it ?—when people eat too free; 
Dyspepsiek—yes, well, Ivrasn't that, it wasn't hard to see. 
21 
Bat Shorty died—then Buster—the caggest of us three; 
Where did we bury Shorty? 
Right there, sir, where you be' 
We couldn't get nobody to help us dig a 
grave, 
Nor couldn't get a 
slsovc1; so Buster took a 
stave 
And sharpened the ends a 
little, and then we digged and 
dug, 
Ind laid poor Shorty in there, and filled the dirt up snug; 
I 
wrapped my weskit round him—and Buster gave his shirt; 
And then I 
spread my shavens were we'd put back the dirt. 
And sometimes when I'm dreamin' I 
seem to hear him say, 
I'm watching near you, Bertie, I'll never go away. 
You want to hear ' bout Buster—Oh! yes, I 
near forgot; 
I 
kinder got o' Shinking about that little spot. 
Well, Buster, he says, fellows, there must be something done, 
Or else there'll be three corpses besides that little one! 
So lie crawls out behind there and starts off towards the train, 
But after while we hears him coming back again; 
Look hole! say, here, my larkies, I 
guess we'll take our ease, 
See! hEre's a 
pound o' crackers, and here's a 
pound o' cheese. 
You see he'd found some money a 
gentleman had lost, 
And then bought cheese and crackers and never thought of 
cost ; 
We'd hardly started eatin' afore we heard a 
noise, 
And then two men came in here, and one said them's the boys; 
The one was a 
policeman; he took hold of Buster's wrist, 
And searched him for the money the other man had missed. 
Put him in jail for that? of course, that's just the way ; 
They never believe anything them thieving bootblacks say. 
Well that left me and Dwarfy both too skeered to speak, 
The cheese and crackers lasted, I 
guess, about a 
week; 
What! live a 
week on crackers? why, laws, I 
guess we could. 
We've lived a 
week on no'hing„ and then felt table good ; 
What we do for fires ?—Well, now, by jinks that's rich, 
Do you suppose that fires was tended for 
sic] 
Why, sir, you see them barrels keep wind 
At night we'd warm a 
boxing, or any way 
us bootblacks, and 
oil pretty good, 
we could. 
At last somehow we manage to get a 
job or two, 
And so one way or ' fluffier we pulls the winter through. 
Now, Mister you be jokin'—you ain't well— then your some, 
I 
here— hollow, Dwarf 
y !—I'm right glad you've come; 
Now mind your eye and listen to what I've got to say, 
We're both of us ag-oin' to leave this very place to-day; 
You see that man there, Dwarfy ? Well, then, just take a 
look 
You never seen his equal in any story book. 
goin' to give us wittles and edication, too, 
And then we'll both have a 
chance to see what we can do. 
Now Mister you're a 
preacher, I 
think I 
beard you say, 
Well, then, before we leave here I'd like to hear you pray ; 
I 
don't know much ' bout prayin', but Shorty knew a 
heap, 
lie allers used to pray, sir, before he went to sleep ; 
Now, Dwarfy, let's kneel down here long side where Shorty 
lays, 
And listen to the preacher and find out how he prays. 
And Mister while you're prayin' please ask Go'd to send 
To other ragged bootblacks as jolly good a 
friend ; 
They aren't all so bad, sir, tho' some do swear and lie, 
Then please ask God to bless 'em, and save ' em when they 
die.

WE came from de city ob Charleston in de State oh South Car-

We've been a

When we started it was early in de Fall. 
We're not such very fancy ,darkies, 
Although we always keep a•looking clean, 
And we hope when you go home to-night your verdict it will be, 
That you are satisfial with what you've seen. 
We used to pick de oranges and sell dem in de streets, 
And seldom dat we made enough to lib; 
So den we went to blacking boots upon de geminen's feet, 
But we got too big and had to quit de biz. 
Now we ain't got time to tell you all our history, 
For which, we hope, you will not think us mean, 
For where we o 
we always like to hear the people say 
Of us, they're satisfied with what they've seen.

Good ebenin', massa white folks,

Originally sung by BBADLIT & W ILD. 
I 
WAS dancing on the levee, 
While the steamboat whistle blowed, 
rhe captain was a

For us nigs and all the crew. 
Of course we obey orders, 
And on the boat went, 
And down the Ohio river, 
What a 
lovely time we spent. 
CTIORIIS, 
Indeed, indeed, I 
did, 
Indeed, indeed, I

Double deed, 
Indeed, indeed, I

Of all the nigs in the land, 
What sails the Mississippi, 
You'll never find a 
happier nig than 30e. 
When we arrived in Tennessee, 
We tbrowed a 
gang plank cut, 
And when we got the freight ashore. 
The mokes conamened to shout. 
The captain told us get the nano, 
And we all could sing, 
And when they play our favorite, 
We cut the pigeon wing.

DARK COMPLECTED COON. 
Original by TAMES BRADLEY'. 
GOOD evening friends, I'll sing to you, 
A 
song and dance which is true, 
I 
loved a 
girl whose name was Lew, 
But now she's ran away, 
She could sing just like a 
bird. 
The sweetest voice you ever heard, 
Her lover too was so absurd, 
And you can always hear me say. 
CHORUS. 
I 
think I 
made a 
big mistake, 
By falling in love with Louisa Flake, 
She ran away, and gave me the shakn, 
With a 
dark conTlected coon, 
Louisa's ma don't feel content, 
For marrying that coon without her consent, 
When she heard the news in alit she went, 
And made a 
terrible grumble, 
I 
know I 
was left in the cold, 
And also I 
was terrible sold, 
I'm to blame myself, I 
scold, 
For causing such a 
trouble. 
I 
think I 
made, ctn.

As sung by L. SCLIOOLCRAFT. 
OLD Mother Proctor, she went to the doctor, 
To save the poor dog's health, 
Mary said to her little lamb, 
You know how it is yourself. 
The boy that would a 
wooing go, 
Was in the level ground laid, 
Johnny I 
hardly knew you, 
Since you joined the lunch brigade. 
(Repeat last four lines for Chorus., 
Supposen now that I 
was you,' 
And supposen you were me, 
Supposen I 
was somebody else, 
I 
wonder whose brother you'd be. 
Oh ! put me in my little bed, 
I 
just want forty winks, 
I'm lonely since my mother croaked, 
And so is Captain Jinks. 
Oh! Mary had a

As white as Pittsburg snow, 
he'd stand on his head for a

And whistle not for Joe.

To draw a

ENOCH, 
Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
I 
ONCE did bye a 
nice young girl, 
A 
beauty I 
declare; 
I 
really thought that she was 
The fairest of the fair; 
She lived at home with her papa, 
Old Enoch was his name; 
She said her father made a 
vow, 
She should never change her name. 
enortus. 
I 
knocked at the knocker, 
Just as Enoch went to sup; 
Enoch he knocked me down, 
Enoch he picked me up, 
Oh! Enoch he knocked me over; 
Enoch knocked me sober; 
Oh ! I 
should like to knock Enoch, 
As Enoch he knocked me. 
He left me standing in the street, 
And looking rather queer; 
I 
never thought he'd serve me so, 
When I 
went to see my dear; 
But waiting there until ' twas dark, 
Sarah she did come out; 
And seeing me in such a 
state, 
Asked me what ' twas all about ; 
SPOKEN— I politely informed her that a few minutes 
before— 
I 
knocked, etc. 
She ran away with me that night, 
And next day we were married; 
And ever since that happy time, 
It does to me occur, 
That if old Enoch I 
should meet, 
I 
wonder what he'd say, 
To find his daughter married, 
Since the night she ran away. 
For I 
knocked, etc, 
Sung by " M A.BEL LEONARD," in her wonderful imper-
sonation of "EVA." 
When your daughter's ta'en away, 
And your heart is filled with care; 
When with Angels I 
shall pray, 
For your peace and comfort here; 
Shall poor Uncle Tom be free? 
Papa, promise this to me. 
When your little Eva's there, 
Robed like those in spotless white, 
And the conqu'ring palm I 
bear, 
Blessed with love and Heaven's light; 
Shall poor Uncle Tom be free ? 
Papa, promise this to me. 
Wife and children send him near, 
When forever I 
am gone,— 
Papa, check the falling tear, 
Think upon my dying song. 
Uncle Tom, oh! make him free! 
Papa, promise this to me.

THE FUNNY PAIR. 
BANJO DUET. 
As sung by the FREEMAN SISTERS with great sueeets. 
OH, here we are a 
very funny pair, 
And of us you had better all beware, 
We can play the banjo and dance and shout, 
And you can bet your bottom dollar, 
That our mothers know we're out, 
What a 
very funny pair are we. 
Oh! what a 
funny little chap is he, 
Ile is too smart for me, 
He went into a 
blacksmith shop 
To get out of the rain, 
He picked up a 
red-hot horse shoe, 
And he laid it down again, 
What a 
smart young cnap was he. 
Oh! you need not laugh quite so loud, 
Of your smartness you need not be so proud, 
She bought a 
lot of Lens, 
And in hot water put their legs, 
To see if she wouldn't make them 
Lay boiled eggs—what a 
smart little girl was she. 
Now you've got yourself into a 
stew, 
Ph tell all the people about you; 
She got married the other day, 
And her husband got tight, 
And he sat up courting her all night, 
What a 
funny old man was he.

For all of us to play and sing and dance. 
Now Joe is getting old and rather shakey, 
And thinks its time for him to take a 
rest; 
So he sent for me to come up here before you, 
And to fill his place, I'll:try and do olr best. 
I

For I

As that will help keep up the family name.

JAMSET,THEE, 
As Sung by JOLINNY Ralca 
JUST like Sinbad the Sailor, 
Or Robinson Crusoe— 
I 
left my native land, in search 
Of wonders I 
would go: 
I 
went to be a 
sailor-i-
I 
come back, as you see, 
A 
mixture of an Indian, 
A 
Turk and Chimpanzee. 
Ciioaus. 
Jamsetjhee, ma jabajehoy, 
Jabbery Dobie Porie, 
Ikey, Pikey, Sikey, Crikey, 
Chillingowullabadorie. 
We'd been to sea a 
fortnight, 
A 
dreadful storm arose: 
Upon an island I 
was threwn, 
To wind and rain exposed, 
By savages sorrounded: 
(It was their island home,) 
They addressed me in a 
language, 
Decidedly their own. 
Jamsetjhee, ma jabajeboy, ke. 
I 
expected from these savages, 
Less pence than kicks and blows, 
They'd a 
funny dress, in fact they'd not 
A 
single stitch of clothes. 
They tore my things from off my back, 
My hair from out the roots, 
They left me with a 
waistcoat, 
A 
hat and pair of boots. 
Jamsetjhee, ma jabajehoy, &c. 
When they'd got all my cloth:lig, 
Thinks I: what next they'll do ? 
They brought their paint and painted me, 
With colors red and blue— 
And so that was my costume; 
A 
waistcoat for my clothes 
Striped red and blue, a 
hat and boots, 
And a 
ring stuck through my nose. 
Jamsetjhee, ma jabajehoy, &c. 
For five years in that costume, 
I 
roamed about the land, 
To a 
damsel of the royal blood 
They made me give my hand: 
And there were great rejoicing's, 
Upon time weld:ng day, 
And we've got two pairs of black kids, 
My wife has taught to say: 
Jamsetjhee, ma jabajehoy, Sze, 
One day a 
ship appeared in sight, 
I'd scarce believe it true— 
To reach the ship I 
stole a 
boat, 
And paddled my own canoe. 
But now Pin back in Merrikey, 
The country I 
adore— 
I'll take good care to stick to it— 
And never leave it more. 
Jamsetjhee, ma jabajehoy, &e.

THE KIND LOVING FACES AT HOME. 
Written and sung by DEN DODGE. 
I'm thinking to- day of the home of my youth, 
Near theI rooklet that runs through the glade, 
The reen grassy lawn and the orchard so dear, 
Where oft in my childhood I've strayed : 
rris many a 
year since those scenes I 
have left, 
Through far- distant countries to roam, 
But whereser I've wandered I've still longed to see 
The kind loving faces at home. 
Cuoitus. 
And though we are parted, yet ever to me 
Sweet thoughts of my loved ones will come ; 
And where'er 
wander I 
still long to see 
The kind loving faces at home. 
How oft in my dreams have my thoughts wandered back 
To my mother, so kind and so true, 
Who whispered " Good by and God bless you, my boy," 
When I 
bid her and father adieu; 
E'en now in my fancy I 
once more can feel 
Her warm, loving kiss on rey brow, 
And sigh when f 
think that ' tis naught but a 
dream, 
For I'm wandering far from her now. 
And though, etc. 
My sweet loving sister, with whom I 
have played 
So oft in our childhood at home, 
Has sent to me many a 
message of love, 
To cheer me wherever I 
roam ; 
My father is waiting to greet me again, 
When my long weary journey is o'er, 
And soon we will meet round the old fireside, 
To part until death, never more.

NELLIE WITH THE GOLDEN HAIR. 
Words by J. F. SEtICIIDIX. 
IN me you see a 
dashing belle, 
My age is just eighteen, 
As a 
leader of the fashions, 
I 
have always been the queen; 
I'm flattered everywhere I 
go, 
By all the gay beau- monde, 
The cause, no doubt, because 
I 
am a 
blonde. 
With them all I've flirted, 
Caring for no one, 
Till one evening lately 
I 
found my heart was gone; 
I'm thinking of him always 
Since that happy night, 
With me I'm sure 
It was " love at. first sight." 
Ctionurs. 
Sweet little Nellie with the golden hair, 
tiSym. None in this whole world can compare 
My charming little Nell. 
I 
was thinking of my little Nell, 
My charming little dear, 
I'm lonely when away from her, 
I 
wish that she were here. 
I'm always glad to be near her, 
The hours to beguile, 
She's got a 
cunning, 
Mirthful, winning, smile. 
Next time we meet I'll courage take, 
My love to her I'll tell 
And ask her if she'll be my own 
My darling little Nell, 
I 
hope she won't refuse me, 
Oh if she should say No, 
'Twould break my heart, 
To ruin I 
would go.

We all know dat it's coming close to lection ;

While other ones are always on the beat.

Sung by GIRARD BROTHERS with great applause. 
The niggers gave a 
ball last week; 
To see the sight would make you squeak. 
The boys they came for miles around, 
To flop their flat foot on the ground. 
They had a 
jawbone and a 
fiddle, 
Banjo as big as a 
pancake griddle, 
Trombone and a 
double bass, 
With string that stuck like jugerpast. 
Slam your foot up to the sky, 
Don't you hear the wenches sigh, 
Huckleberry do, and cranberry jam, 
Sallie pass along some ham. 
There was Margaret and Motildo, 
Anomostator and Molinder, 
Sarrafelier came to the hop, 
The wench that busted the policy shop. 
They danced and danced in two and twos. 
And wore the soles all off their shoes. 
When a 
nigger hit a 
gong a 
smash, 
All the coons ran up for hash. 
Slam your foot, etc. 
The supper was a 
sight to sec, 
With catfish, coons, and fricassc ; 
With eels and liver served on toast, 
And aligators boiled and roast. 
They cat until they couldn't walk, 
Drank gin until they couldn't talk ; 
Danced till they fell down in the hall, 
And that busted up the fancy ball. 
Slam your foot, etc.

George Barnwell, THE M EECHANT'S CLERK—This is an 
extremely sensational sketch, but shows Truth stranger than Fiction. 
This deluded victim went from crime to crime with a 
fearful rapidity, 
urged by the baneful influences of women lost to honor. He realized 
every moment the evils of his course, but, like a 
bird fluttering over the 
basilisk eye of the serpent, he went down, down, into the vortex of ruin 
and despair. This book teaches, in the strongest way, the moral lesson 
of resisting that temptation, which comes arrayed like an " angel of 
light"—beautiful to the eye, and blasting to the soul.— Price 25 Cents.

"Ala ingenious little book of the thaumaturgie order, has been sent uS, 
Called ' Humorr71 DuatrrY,' and bound in such a 
way as to give opportu, 
nity for a 
decidedly puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary ap-
pearance of a 
child's picture book, gaily printed and colored, it is et; 
bound that a 
practised manipulator taking it up and flirting the leave 
over, can make it appear to be filled only with one picture, or with blank 
pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of figures. 
One minute the 
pamphlet, quickly thumbed, appears to contain nothing but the portraP 
of Harlequin, in his tesselated suit; the next only Columbine, theit 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephistophiles. A
