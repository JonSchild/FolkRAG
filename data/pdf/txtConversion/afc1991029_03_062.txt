Informant/Event:  Roadside crosses
 
Coworker:
 
Site:  Baker-Brook,  New Brunswick  (Route 120;  corner of Cyr and Du
 
lac roads)
 
These fieldnotes describe a photography shoot on 15 June
 
1991,  documenting two roadside crosses  (croix de chemin)  in
 
Baker-Brook,  New Brunswick.
 
On 15 June 1991 I went to Baker-Brook,  New Brunswick to try
 
my hand at working for the first time with the American Folklife
 
Center SLR camera equipment.  Since my limited experience in
 
documentary photography has depended on using semi-automatic
 
equipment,  it seemed wise to seek a simple,  stable piece of
 
material culture whose patience would not be tried too sorely by
 
the inexpertise and fumbling of a rank beginner.  The roadside
 
cross on Rte.  120 in Baker-Brook,  which I have seen many times on
 
my commute between my home in St.  Basile and the University,
 
seemed to me as good a choice as any.
 
I arrived at the site at about 2:30 p.m.  on a variably
 
clouded afternoon.
 As soon as I got out of the car,  and for the
 
four hours which followed,  I was surrounded by a haze of black
 
flies and mosquitoes.
 
ROADSIDE CROSS:  ROUTE 120.  The cross on Rte.  120 stands on
 
the south edge of the road at the westernmost limit of the
 
village on the Baker-Brook/Clair line a few yards east of the
 
wooden welcome sign which greets the passer-by arriving from
 
Clair. About thirty yards east of the cross is a driveway and a
 
modern home.
 The cross faces Route 120 about ten feet from the
 
road's edge.
 At a distance of about five feet from the road,  the
 
cross is flanked by two pillars approximately thirty inches tall,
 
made of cement encrusted with fieldstone,  ringed at the top with
 
chunks of white field quartz,  and topped with large round rocks
 
painted black.
 Anchored at the base between two stout pieces of
 
sawn lumber,  the cross stands square and erect some 20 feet high.
 
It is sheathed with what appears to be white aluminum siding.
 
The cross is ornamented with three incised black balls
 
(overall appearance suggests bathroom appliance type of float
 
balls)  about six inches in diameter fitted with stems which
 
insert into the top of the vertical post and at either end of the
 
crosspiece Mounted on the vertical post is a wooden shrine box
 
enclosed in front and on the sides by glass panes.  The box is
 
about sixteen inches high by twenty inches wide.
 It contains a
 
polychrome bust of Jesus which looks to me to be cast,  perhaps in
 
plaster.  The statue's right hand gestures the sign of peace,
 
while the left hand points toward the heart.  "ETERNAL LIGHT"  is
 
lettered at the base of the bust and just above this text there
 
appears to be what might have been a candle holder the top of
 
which seems to have been damaged.
 The bust is surrounded by
 
plastic artificial flowers and wreathed by a string of colored
 
electric Christmas
 
lights;  an electric cord comes out the back of the shrine box and
 
plugs into an outlet behind the base of the cross.  I have often
 
seen the shrine lit up in the evening.  When I visited this
 
afternoon,  the Christmas lights were off,  suggesting that the
 
electrification may be on some kind of a timer.
 if there was an
 
on/off switch on the cross,  I didn't see it.
 
Across the road from the cross,  the land rises gently.  There
 
is a farmstead.
 Slightly west the cross,  a driveway curves up
 
the hill past a small garden to a barn which just about faces the
 
cross.  There were a few men working on machinery in the barn and
 
I went over and asked one of them if I might walk along the edge
 
of the garden below the barn to get a picture of the cross.  That
 
was okay.
 I also asked if he knew who built the cross.
 He told
 
me the person to talk to was André Paillard,  the owner of the
 
house just east of the cross.
 
Mr.  Paillard happened by while I was taking pictures.
 He
 
was walking back to his home with his baby daughter on his
 
shoulders.
 Because the black flies were so bad,  my information
 
gathering was very brief.  Mr.  Paillard,  who looks to be in his
 
late twenties,  told me that he owns the cross site land,  but that
 
the cross was erected by a Mr.   
 Michaud  (Mr.  Paillard could
 
not recollect a first name)  whose children live in Baker-Brook on
 
Rte.  120 about one mile east.  The Michaud family apparently take
 
care of the upkeep of the cross,  an arrangement worked out
 
between Mr.  Paillard and Mr.   
 Saint-Jean  (
?)  from whom Mr.
 
Paillard purchased the land.
 
Mr.  Paillard also told me that traditionally,  there were
 
roadside crosses at the edges of every village in the area,  but
 
that only Baker-Brook seemed to have maintained its crosses.
 He
 
suggested that I could find another cross on Route 120 at the
 
eastern limit of Baker-Brook.
 
After completing my shoot,  I took my car to the eastern edge
 
of the village,  where a wooden sign on the northern edge of Route
 
120  (very similar to the one I had just seen)  welcomes the
 
traveller arriving from Saint-Hilaire.
 I saw no sign of a
 
roadside cross nor of there ever having been a cross on either
 
side of the road.
 Across the road in the driveway of a modern
 
ranch-style home  (1196,  Route 120),  just over the line into
 
Saint-Hilaire,  a woman who looked to be in her mid-forties was
 
unsuccessfully trying to start her lawn mower.
 I halloed and
 
went over to ask her about whether there might have once been a
 
roadside cross at the eastern edge of the village.  Pauline Martin
 
told me that there had indeed been such a cross but that it had
 
been 
 
husband I
me 
 
_
 
Bertin Martin,  who also looked to be perhaps in his mid-
forties,  told me that Mr.  Wilfred Saucier and the village prie
 
had taken care of the cross,  but that it had eventually begun
 
rot and fall apart  (1
1cl6tait toute d6fraichiell).
 When
 
construction began on a series of new homes along Route 120
 
around 1970,  the priest gave permission for the cross to be to
 
d
o wn.

ROADSIDE CROSS:  CYR AND DU LAC ROADS.
 This roadside cross
 
is located on the north bank of Du Lac road,  angled southeast so
 
that it greets the passer-by travelling from Baker -Brook on Cyr
 
Road.  It is a wooden cross,  mounted on a square,  raised base
 
about 4'  x 4'  enclosed in white wooden picket gating.
 The base
 
rises about three feet high from its cement foundation.
 It is
 
filled with dirt and must once have been planted with flowers,
 
but is presently overgrown with dandelions and grass.
 In front
 
of the base,  facing the road,  there is a low wooden planter,  also
 
filled with weeds.
 The base itself is enclosed on three sides by
 
white-painted wooden picket fencing.
 The enclosed grass between
 
the base and the picket fencing  (about two feet wide)  is planted
 
with what look to be several rose bushes;  like the planter and
 
the base,  this enclosure is also overgrown with weeds.
 
The cross rises about twenty feet high from the base.
 In
 
the center of the cross piece is a red-painted wooden heart,
 
slightly raised.
 Four pie-wedge shaped blocks of wood have been
 
added to fill in the angles of the crosspiece,  framing the heart
 
in a rounded square.
 The ends of the top of the vertical piece
 
and the crosspiece are somewhat rounded.  A wooden plaque reading
 
"INRI"  in plan capitol black letters is attached to the main post
 
about one foot from the top of the cross; pains have been taken
 
to shape the plaque and paint a couple of lines to suggest a
 
scroll.
 
The cross is also ornamented with two tools of the Passion:
 
the ladder and the lance.  Both are perhaps fifteen feet in length
 
and rise from the base of the cross to form a "V." A long,
 
narrow,  ten-runged brown-painted wooden ladder is nailed to the
 
vertical piece at the base of the cross,  and extends up to the
 
left crosspiece,  where it is nailed,  and continues about two feet
 
beyond.  The lance is made of a piece of black-painted steel
 
tubing which crosses over the ladder and is bolted at the base of
 
the cross.  It extends upward about two feet past the right
 
crosspiece,  where it is also bolted,  and is tipped with what
 
appears to be a homemade lance point cut out of some kind of
 
sheet metal.
 
On the vertical post of the cross about four feet up from
 
the base is a small,  roofed,  wooden shrine box.
 It was once
 
enclosed on two,  perhaps three sides by pane glass but only one
 
side pane remains in place  (an unbroken side pane is lying in the
 
grass of the enclosed raised base).
 I didn't take the dimension
 
of the shrine box;  I'd guess it was about 12" wide by 18" tall.
 
There is a small polychrome statue of a robed Jesus revealing the
 
Sacred Heart.
 The statue looks like it was cast from a mold;
 
probably in plaster,  and its colors are worn from exposure to the
 
elements.
 Facial details are clearly though somewhat roughly
 
outlined in brown paint,  and it looks as if the original paint
 
faded and someone retraced the essential features the best they
 
could.

This fieldnote describes a backroads tour through the Saint
 
John Valley in the company of fieldworkers Ray Brassieur and
 
David Whitman,  with guides Julia Bayly and Patrick Ouellette,  on
 
17 June 1991.
 
Before the arrival of the fieldteam,  David Taylor and I had
 
discussed the possibility of organizing some kind of road tour
 
through the Saint John Valley for them early in June.  I asked
 
Julia Bayly,  Coordinator of Public Relations and Alumni Services
 
at University of Maine at Fort Kent,  for suggestions about
 
possible tourguides.
 She suggested that her husband,  Patrick
 
Ouellette,  might make a very good candidate.
 He was born and
 
raised in Fort Kent,  has driven a delivery van locally,  and has a
 
passion for riding the back roads.
 
Julia Bayly came from Portland,  Oregon to Fort Kent about
 
eleven years ago.
 She completed an undergraduate degree in
 
social sciences at UNFK,  then worked as a journalist and
 
photographer for the Saint John Valley Times, a local weekly,  and
 
the Bangor Daily News. 
She was hired at University of Maine at
 
Fort Kent in her present position about two years ago.
 
Patrick Ouellette,  born and raised in Fort Kent,  worked as a
 
mechanic and delivery truck driver for A.D.  Soucy,  a local
 
wholesale grocery outlet in Fort Kent  (which closed in 1978)  as a
 
high school student.
 After completing high school,  and returning
 
from a couple of years in the service,  Patrick took a degree in
 
vocational training and also completed an associate degree in
 
forestry at the University of Maine at Fort Kent,  where he and
 
Julia met.
 Patrick taught automotive mechanics for the Fort Kent
 
Community High School and taught some freelance courses before
 
taking on his present job as salesperson at Roy's Auto Parts in
 
Fort Kent.
 
At one point early on in June,  Cathie Corey of the Madawaska
 
Chamber of Commerce seemed to suggest that her organization would
 
organize a Saint John Valley tour,  but this did not materialize.
 
On the week of 10 June,  I spoke again with Julia about the
 
possibility of a tour.  She subsequently confirmed that Patrick
 
was willing to give us a tour and that she would take on
 
chauffeuring the University van,  which she suggested we take
 
given the
 number of hours such a tour might involve.  17 June was
 
selected as the tour date because it meshed with Patrick's weekly
 
work schedule.
 
Patrick Ouellette came to the field office around 9:30 a. m.
 
the morning of the tour.
 While we waited for Julia to get out of
 
a University meeting,  Patrick outlined the itinerary on the
 
office map.
 When Julia arrived at around 10:15 a. m.,  we all
 
piled into the University van and took off.  Throughout the day,
 
the weather was fair,  warm and slightly breezy.
 
THE ROAD TRIP
 
Down Market Street to Charette Hill:
 
We headed south on Route 11,  took the Fish River / Fort Kent
 
Mills Bridge over to Market Street,  and headed north towards
 
Charette Hill Road.
 Bangor and Aroostook railroad tracks run
 
along Market Street on the line heading south along Route 11
 
toward Ashland.
 As is the case with so many towns and villages
 
in the Saint John Valley along the B&A line,  the Market Street
 
track is lined with a series of potato warehouses.  The warehouses
 
are long frame buildings,  sometimes covered with some sheet metal
 
siding,  roofed with a variety of materials,  including asbestos or
 
metal roofing.
 Some of them are build in row-house fashion,  with
 
firewalls between the buildings.  Patrick mentioned that there
 
used to be potato houses by the tracks all along Market Street.
 
Many of them,  he added,  have burned down.
 ["The Fish River
 
Railroad,  which ran along Route 11,  opened access to markets to
 
Fort Kent in 1901,  and was added to the B&A system in 1903."

Up Charette HIll Road to Church Road  (
= Saint Luce Road =
 
Sainte Agathe Road):
 
We turned east on Charette Hill Road,  which begins as a
 
paved road and turns to a dirt road.

Informant/Event:  Chasse,  Geraldine "Gerry"  and Ernest  "Ernie"
 
Coworker:  Whitman,  David
 
Site:  Saint David,  Me.;  Madawaska,  Me.
 
These incidental fieldnotes describe a visit with Ernest
 
"Ernie" and Geraldine "Gerry"  Chasse at their home  in Saint
 
David,  Me.  on 21 June 1991.
 
CONTEXT OF VISIT:  The primary focus of 21 June 1991 was the
 
documentation of the Centennial Concert at Saint Bruno Parish
 
Church honoring the Good Shepherd Sisters congregation of Van
 
Buren,  Me.
 David Whitman and I were on our way down to Van Buren
 
from Fort Kent.
 A brief visit to the Chasse home was on our
 
itinerary.
 Mrs.  Chasse  (founder and president of the Madawaska
 
Historical Society)  had materials which Camilla Bryce-Laporte had
 
requested in connection with the Maine Acadian Culture Survey;  in
 
addition,  we hoped to learn something of the construction and
 
history of the Chasse household.  Ray Brassieur had learned from
 
Mrs.  Chasse that her house was quite old,  and was  interested in
 
its potential as the site for in-depth documentation by Howard
 
Marshall.
 
VISIT SYNOPSIS:
 David Whitman and I arrived at the Chasse home
 
at about 2:30 p. m.  Mrs.  Chasse greeted us and showed us  in,
 
through the gleaming kitchen,  around the dining room table
 
stacked with Sirois-Dupléssis reunion materials,  and into the
 
living room,  a small,  comfortable room full of upholstered and
 
cushioned chairs.  We chatted for a while about the lovely
 
patchwork cushions which Mrs.  Chasse made to decorate the sofa
 
[she also made cushions for all of her children],  about the
 
upcoming Acadian Festival  (Madawaska,  Me.),  and about the
 
upcoming Sirois-Dupléssis Family Reunion,  of which she is  in
 
charge.  (Mrs.  Chasse has been coordinating the annual family
 
reunions which are part of the Acadian Festival  for eleven
 
years.)  Conversation turned to her own life and travels.
 Her
 
husband Ernest  "Ernie"  Chasse arrived during the conversation and
 
we were introduced.
 
We then accompanied Mrs.  Chasse on a brief foray around the
 
house,  starting in the basement and working our way upstairs and
 
through the guest apartment.  David Whitman collected the
 
publications which Mrs.  Chasse had put aside for the survey,  and
 
after a brief chat about the Chasse home with Mr.  Chasse,  David
 
and I made our departure at about 4:00 p.m.
 
DOCUMENTS RECEIVED:
 Mrs.  Chasse gave David Whitman a box
 
full of Madawaska Historical Society publications as requested by
 
Camilla.
 She also gave me a gift copy of her book Ernie, a 1990
 
biography of her husband Ernest C.  Chasse  (with a genealogy of
 
his family)  which she wrote in honor of his eightieth birthday.

The main house is oriented with the gables parallel to U

Rte. 1 and the front door opens toward the road.  The gables of
 
the second building are perpendicular with the main house. Ther
 
is a large gable dormer in the front center of the main house a
 
a railed front porch which runs the full length of the main
 
house. Access to the guest apartment is provided in the back of
 
the smaller building by a flight of stairs which lead up to a
 
small balcony.
 I 
The main house downstairs front door opens into a central
 
hallway.
 To the immediate right is Ernie Chasse's office;  on t i
 
eft,  the hallway communicates with the living room.
 The living
 
room opens into a dining room.
 Down the hall from Mr.  Chasse is
 
the kitchen area  [I believe there are a main kitchen and perhaps
 
a pantry].
 Between the kitchen and the living room are a flight
 
of stairs leading up to the second floor.
 The second floor
 
consists of three bedrooms and a bathroom which gives egress to
 
the guest apartment.  The walls and floors of the bedrooms are
 
planked.  The attic trapdoor is located in the bathroom,  which
 
Mrs.  Chasse says once contained the water tanks for some kind of
 
early,  gravity-fed indoor plumbing.  The plumbing was apparently
 
pretty noisy and the family christened this room "le belier"  (the
 
ram).
 
The bathroom also contains a sort of walk-in cupboard which
 
one of the Chasse boys formerly used as a darkroom.
 The doors to
 
the cupboard looked to me to be handmade.  They caught my eye
 
because they had the same kind of trimming as some old doors in
 
the Augustin Albert homestead,  which Ray Brassieur pointed out as
 
being a typically Acadian.  In this decorative bevelling
 
technique,  the outside door presents a flat,  undecorated surface
 
and the inside is trimmed with bevelling  (the opposite of the
 
usual custom of bevel trimming on the door front) .
 The guest
 
apartment consists of a living room which Geraldine uses as her
 
office,  a bedroom,  and a small kitchen.
 There was a lot of
 
tongue-and-groove wall and floorboard in the bedroom.
 
HISTORY OF THE HOMESTEAD LOCATION:  [The following information was
 
taken from Geraldine Chasse's Ernie (Madawaska,  Maine:  by the
 
author,  1990,  pp.  19a-20a])]:  to the best of her knowledge,  the
 
homestead designated #146,  Township 18  (a post-Webster-Ashburton
 
treaty property designation)  was one of the original British Land
 
Grants of 1790 given to the charter families of the Madawaska
 
Territory.  It sits on the land whose river shore frontage
 
includes the "Acadian Landing Site"  [the site at which the
 
founding families are supposed to have arrived from Ste.  Anne,
 
New Brunswick in June 1785 and erected a cross;  at present,  this
 
site is marked by a white marble cross recognized as an official
 
national historic site by the National Register of Historic Sites
 
and Monuments.]
 
Geraldine Chasse  (cont'd.):  The original settler of this
 
land was Jean-Baptiste Fournier,  who,  along with forty-nine other
 
colonists,  received a 200-acre land grant from the British
 
Government for land on which he had already made substantial
 
improvements.
 Fournier gave the land to son Jean-Baptiste Jr.  in
 
1791.
 Mrs.  Chasse has been unable to document the home for the
 
period 1791-1819.  The next known owner was Francois David Durepos
 
(from Rivière Ouelle,  Quebec),  who married twice:  with Suzanne
 
Hébert and,  in 1848 to Leah Pelletier of St.  Basile,  N.B.
 The
 
Durepos homestead is described in the Dean & Kavanaugh report of
 
1831.
 
Geraldine Chasse  (cont'd.):  In 1869,  a widowed Leah
 
Pelletier Durepos,  sole heir to the farm,  remarried Ephren
 
Michaud.  In 1871,  widowed again,  she asked her nephew Joseph
 
Pelletier of Pincher Creek,  Alberta to return to the Valley and
 
take over the property.
 She deeded him the farm for $1500.
 
Geraldine Chasse  (cont'd.):  Joseph Pelletier and his wife
 
Edith Cyr continued to manage the homestead until 1908.
 In 1898,
 
they had the wooden house covered with brick.  In 1903,  Joseph
 
sold and deeded the land to his son George Pelletier.
 The son
 
rebuilt the barn that had been destroyed by fire.
 He built the
 
first pre-fabricated building in the area,  when he ordered a pre-
cut barn from "out west." This barn was destroyed by fire in
 
1969.
 
Geraldine Chasse  (cont'd.):  In 1926,  George Pelletier sold
 
the farm to Ernest Chasse's father and mother,  Ernest R.  and
 
Falvie Roy Chasse,  who moved from their small St.  David farm to
 
the homestead.
 Ernest "Ernie" Chasse bought the homestead from
 
his father in 1943.
 During the 1940's,  a government program,
 
"Acre Allotment" enabled him to expand his 167 acre land holdings
 
to 1100 acres.  In 1976 all of the farmlands except the family
 
homestead were sold.
 
PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM GERALDINE CHASSE:
 Geraldine's
 
husband Ernest Chasse was born in Saint Agatha,  Me.,  in 1910,  one
 
of fifteen children.  He farmed potatoes for thirty-three years,
 
gradually developing a second business in heavy machinery and
 
trucking  (Chasse Gravel Service Inc.).
 He married Regina Cyr of
 
Saint-Basile,  N.E.  in 1930 and was widowed in 1946.
 In 1951 he
 
met Geraldine Chasse and they married.  Geraldine and Ernest have
 
six children from their marriage and one son from Mr.  Chasse's
 
previous marriage.
 
Geraldine Pelletier Chasse was raised in Saint Francis,  Me.
 
She became a teacher while her two sisters became a
 
physiotherapist and a nurse.  During World War II,  Geraldine spent
 
about five years in New York City,  where her sisters were working
 
in their respective professions.  She also followed her sisters to
 
California,  where she stayed for a brief period.
 In New York
 
Geraldine didn't teach,  but did clerical and secretarial work.
 
Most of her friends from that period were European refugees.
 She
 
remembered living on Riverside Drive and going to Passover
 
Seders.
 
[I commented that Geraldine and her sisters seemed unusually
 
adventuresome for their time.
 Geraldine concurred,  adding that
 
in her time,  "if a French girl went to the city,  it was her
 
downfall."
 There was community sanction against young women
 
going to the city;  nice girls stayed at home.
 Mrs.  Chasse
 
commented that World War II and the WACs changed a lot of things,
 
including some community attitudes about gender roles.  Before
 
World War II,  there was also strong sanction against marriage
 
outside the French Catholic community,  even to an Irish Catholic.
 
"If a French girl married an Irishman,  she was an outcast for a
 
while."
 
In 1951,  she met and married Ernest Chasse.
 [A photograph
 
from  their first date  (which took place in the New York City
 
vicinity)  hangs over the sofa in the living room.]  Portrait
 
photographs of the children are also prominently displayed,  and
 
Geraldine proudly told us a little about each of them.  She began
 
by saying that she got married in 1951 and decided she would try
 
to populate the world.
 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON HOME:
 Geraldine Chasse:
 the
 
house is insulated with buckwheat chaff.
 The original home was 1
 
1/2 stories.
 Mrs.  Chasse isn't sure about the age of her home,
 
though she is sure it is very old; perhaps as old as 140-150
 
years.
 Her best guess is that it would have been built by
 
François David Durepos.  She and her husband did some renovations
 
on the home,  but made no major structural changes.
 The house was
 
originally located closer to the flats on the shore of the St.
 
John River.
 It was moved to its present location sometime in the
 
1800's.
 
When Mrs.  Chasse took David Whitman and I to the second
 
floor on the tour through the house,  she commented that she had
 
something  [furnishings]  from every farm family in St.  David in
 
her home,  but that she was "one wife too late."
 She explained
 
that the first Mrs.  Chasse,  like other homemakers of her era,
 
threw out a lot of the old handmade furnishings to make room for
 
new,  store-bought,  manufactured ones.
 Mrs.  Chasse likes "the old
 
stuff" and made a point of trying to collect some of it.
 She
 
shows us an old brass bedstead in one room,  and referred to a
 
collection of short-legged chairs which are in the basement.
 
INFORMATION ABOUT HOUSE FROM ERNEST "ERNIE" CHASSE:  "From what I
 
heard from my father and the old people,  the house is something
 
in the vicinity of 140-150 years old."
 The main home was built
 
first; the summer kitchen was added some fifty years later,  at
 
the same time as the "Chipman"  [my spelling]  brickwork from
 
Quebec was added.  [If,  as Mrs.  Chasse believes,  Joseph Pelletier
 
added the brickwork in 1898,  Mr.  Chasse's information would date
 
the original construction of the main house back to 1849,  during
 
the ownership of Francois David Durepos.]

ARRIVAL OF VIOLETTE FAMILY IN THE SAINT JOHN VALLEY:
 
[Synopsis of notes taken from Mr.  and Mrs. Violette]:  The
 
Violette family came from the Kenebeccassis  (my spelling]  region
 
of New Brunswick to the Saint John Valley some time in the
 
1780 1s.  The Kenebeccassis had been an area of Acadian settlement.
 
Frangois Violette and his son Augustin were two of five charter
 
families who settled the area then known as I
'La Grande Rivi&rell
 
settlement,  which included lands on both shores of the Saint John
 
River known today as Van Buren,  Me.  and Saint-L6onard,  N.B.
 
Although the documentary record does not pinpoint the exact date
 
of arrival,  it is clear from a letter sent by Frangois to his
 
wife dated 1789 that he received his land grant from the British
 
government that year for lands which he had been clearing.
 
In the 1830's,  when,  according to the Violette's best
 
estimate,  the Val Violette house was built,  Van Buren was known
 
as "le ruisseau des Violette"  (
= Violette Brook).
 Van Buren was
 
the name given to the settlement following the Webster Ashburton
 
Treaty of 1842.  Elmer Violette:  questioned the reasoning that led
 
to renaming the settlement Van Buren;  certainly doesn't reflect
 
the area's settlement history,  though the name clearly refers to
 
the U.S.  president of the time of the Treaty,  Martin Van Buren.
 
VIOLETTE HOUSE:
 [Ray questioned Mr.  and Mrs.  Violette
 
concerning the Violette home  (address:  -
-
---) which is registered
 
on the National Register of Historic Places.]
 Mr.  and Mrs.
 
Violette:  this house is a two-story square timber gable roof
 
building with ship's knees formerly located to the store owned by
 
Elmer Violette's father.  The corners of the horizontal wall
 
timbers did not fit into grooves;  rather,  they were half-notched
 
and pegged.  Mr.  Violette couldn't remember the location of the
 
original door but remembers that the entry was large and that
 
there was a central hail.
 
Today a modern dwelling occupies the site.  At one time,  the
 
house was divided into apartments and two of Elmer Violette's
 
brothers lived there.
 His mother donated the old home to the
 
Heritage Vivant I Living Heritage Society  (Van Buren,  Me.)
 
sometime around the mid-1970's.
 She hoped that the Society would
 
be able to move the home to the Acadian Village  (Van Buren,  Me.)
 
but the Society could not afford the more than $10,000 expenses
 
involved.
 Mrs.  Violette therefore gave the home to the Society
 
with the understanding that the home would be dismantled,  removed
 
to the Village acadien  (Van Buren,  Me.) ,
 and re-assembled there.
 
The house was in fact dismantled and the pieces were carefully
 
numbered. Mr.  and Mrs. Violette were not sure about the precise
 
whereabouts of the disassembled Violette home;  perhaps the pieces
 
had been moved to the presbytery where Don Cyr  (Lille,  Me.)
 
resides.
 In any case,  they recommended contacting Don Cyr for
 
further information.
 
REGIONAL PARISH DEVELOPMENT. Marcella Belanger Violette:
 
Saint Bruno became a canonical parish  (with a permanent priest)
 
in 1838.
 In 1826,  a chapel had been built on the south shore of
 
the Grande-Rivière settlement and there had been a visiting
 
priest.
 That chapel was subsequently moved from its original
 
site north of Van Buren to the present location of the Saint
 
Bruno Church.  Saint Bruno was the first "daughter parish" of
 
Saint-Basile,  N.B.;  the next "daughter parish" was Saint Luce
 
(Frenchville).
 
In 1884,  the Marist fathers arrived in Saint Bruno,  where
 
they took charge of parish development.
 They established Saint
 
Mary's College  (a college which offered education from sixth
 
grade through college and which closed in 1926).
 The Good
 
Shepherd Sisters arrived in Van Buren in 1891.
 In order to
 
accommodate them,  the Diocese of Portland bought the building
 
formerly housing the Hall Inn on High Street and turned it into a
 
convent.
 
In Saint Basile,
 N.B.,  the Sisters of Saint Joseph
 
established Maillet College in the early 1900's;  the Eudist
 
Fathers  (first established in France by Jean Eudes),  who had
 
orders in the Maritimes,  founded Saint Louis,  a classical
 
college,  in the Edmundston,  N.B.
 region.
 These two institutions
 
were subsequently fused to become the Saint Louis-Maillet
 
University Center  (Centre universitaire Saint-Louis-Maillet).
 
In Saint-Basile,  N.B.,  the Sisters of Charity  (a Nova Scotia
 
order)  and the Sisters of Saint Joseph established a convent,
 
hospice,  and orphanage.
 
[Ray mentioned that he had heard that a local parish was
 
closing.]  Mr.  and Mrs.  Violette:  On 30 June 1991,  the last Mass
 
will be celebrated at Saint Remi parish  (Keegan,  Me.);  the parish
 
will then be consolidated into Saint Bruno.  Saint Rerni parish was
 
established around 1920-21,  when there were two big active lumber
 
mills in Keegan and the town was booming.
 Elmer Violette:  In its
 
heyday,  the Keegan Mill was called the largest lumber mill east
 
of the Mississippi.
 Those mills eventually closed.  [Ray wondered
 
if Saint Remi's closing didn't have something to do with the lack
 
of available priests.]  Marcella Violette:
 lack of priests is one
 
factor;  another factor is that Keegan's population has been
 
declining for many years and there just aren't enough
 
parishioners to keep the parish operational.
 
LANGUAGE IN THE CHURCH:  Masses at
 Saint Bruno Church are
 
offered in English.
 During the month of May  (the month of the
 
Blessed Virgin)  and October  (the month of the Holy Rosary),
 
rosaries will be said in French at evening prayers.

Levite and Catherine Cormier Sirois raised a family of twelve
 
children in Hamlin. The family had no farm and Mr.  Sirois's father
 
worked as a day-laborer for neighboring farmers.
 As a young boy,
 
Rosaire was often sent by his mother to collect his father's wages
 
from recalcitrant farmers who owed him back wages.
 
ROSAIRE  SIROIS  -
-
 LIFE  HISTORY:
 Mr.  Sirois  was  born  and
 
raised in Hamlin Plantation,  Me.  in 1924.  For approximately 35-8
 
years, he worked for the railroad in Maine and in Connecticut as a
 
breakman, conductor, and flagman.  He would have liked to get a job
 
as fireman,  yardmaster or official,  but he was never able "to get
 
ahead."  He attributes this lack of professional advancement to his
 
ethnic,  religious,  and political backgrounds  (described to me as
 
"French,  Catholic,  Democrat,  and  a Mason").  For  many years,  Mr.
 
Sirois was laid off in the summertime.
 In order to supplement his
 
income,  he  worked  as  a door-to-door  salesman,  peddling  patent
 
medicines, lotions and ointments, and a variety of cooking supplies
 
(e.g.  pie fillings and spices)  throughout the Saint John Valley.
 
At the age of thirty-six, Mr. Sirois married Thérèse Bouchard,
 
a practical  nurse  from  St.  David,  Me.
 Mr.  Sirois  met  his  wife
 
while  in  the  hospital  recovering  from  a  railroad  injury.  He
 
remembers that his first question to his future wife was whether
 
she could make ployes. 
When she responded in the affirmative,  he
 
knew that he had a good prospect for marriage. Mr. Sirois described
 
his wife as being an excellent cook of traditional regional foods.
 
Together, Mr. and Mrs. Sirois raised five children.  They presently
 
live  in north Caribou  in a home  framed  in hewn  timber which Mr.
 
Sirois believes is approximately 110 years old.
 
At present, Mr. and Mrs. Rosaire Sirois live in North Caribou,
 
Maine.
 Since taking retirement from the railroad,  Mr.  Sirois has

ROSAIRE SIROIS -

 DECISION TO DO A PRESENTATION AT THE ACADIAN
 
FESTIVAL:
 [Earlier this morning, Mr.  Sirois had made a remarkable
 
presentation on the cultural heritage of the Saint John Valley.
 In
 
front  of  a  backdrop  of  artifacts  which  he  had  assembled  for
 
display, Mr. Sirois spoke compellingly about the world of his youth
 
and described  local expressive culture ranging  from architecture
 
and foodways to agricultural practices and toponymy. I asked him if
 
he  was  in  the  habit  of  making  this  kind  of  presentation.]
 
According to Mr. Sirois, his morning presentation at Madawaska High
 
School was a debut effort aimed at providing a more representative
 
portrait  of  regional  life  than  had  been  available  at  Acadian
 
Festival  presentations  of  recent  years.
 His  decision  to  put
 
together a presentation resulted from his experience of attending
 
official activities associated with the Bouchard family reunion at
 
last  year's  Acadian  Festival  (his  wife  is  a Bouchard  from  St.
 
David, Me.). As he described it, he attended several workshops and
 
lectures on the history and culture of the Acadians of the Saint
 
John Valley. The focus of these presentations was on the remote or
 
romanticized past  (e.g.,  Evangeline and Louis XIV and "Les filles
  
du roil') . After a couple of days,  a friend of his from the Valley
 
whom  he  described  as  "a  real  old-timer"  who  also  was  attending
 
these workshops  on regional history and culture came over to him
 
and said,  "you know,  they're missing the boat." Mr.  Sirois agreed
 
with his friend.  He concluded that the organizers of the Acadian
 
Festival were primarily "upper class people" who simply were not
 
interested in presenting the local culture.
 So he decided to put
 
together his own presentation.

 REGIONAL HISTORY AND FOLKLIFE:
 
"HAND  BRAND":
 This  extremely  potent, high-proof
 (160-180)
 
unbonded Canadian grain alcohol was a popular smuggling item during
 
the  Prohibition  period.
 "Hand  brand"  took  its  name  from  the
 
picture  of  a  hand  which  appeared  on  the  canister.  Virtually
 
undrinkable  in  its undiluted state,  "hand brand" was customarily
 
tested for  its purity by touching a lighted match to a teaspoon
 
filled  with  the  alcohol;  a burst  of  flame  indicated  "the  real
 
item."  Customarily,  "hand  brand"  was  diluted  for  drinking  at  a
 
ratio  of  one  gallon  of  alcohol  to  three  gallons  of  water.
 
Apparently, people who were selling "hand brand" would usually keep
 
their store hidden in the home, frequently under a trapdoor leading
 
to a cellar storeroom.
 One ploy to hinder an investigator with a
 
warrant from discovering the location of the illegal wares was to
 
place  a rug  over  the  trapdoor,  over  which was  placed  a rocking
 
chair  containing the mother  of  the  house,  complete with  nursing
 
baby.
 
SHIP KNEES:
 [Mr.  Sirois had spoken at some length about ship
 
knees during his presentation at Madawaska High School earlier this
 
morning; he has been interested in them for several years and has
 
actively looked for them around his region]  Mr.  Sirois mentioned
 
that  the  proper  French  term  for  ship  knee  is  coude [which  he
 
pronounced as "courbe"], which he translated as "elbow." Mr. Sirois
 
learned this  term  from Mr.  Jean  Fortin,  a ninety-three year  old
 
retired  house  carpenter  who  lives  in  Mr.
 Clement  Laplante's
 
boarding house  in Van Buren.
 Mr.  Fortin remembers  tearing down
 
homes in the region which contained ship knees.
 Although somewhat
 
hard of hearing,
 Mr.  Fortin apparently is a sociable man with a
 
ready memory.
 
Mr.  Sirois  mentioned  a  few  structures  in  his  area  which
 
contain ship knees:
 
-
 a barn owned by Mr.  Goughan [my spelling],  who owns a fruit
 
cn the Fort Fairfield road out of Caribou;
 
-
 Sacred Heart Church  in north Caribou;  Mr.  Sirois believes
 
that this church is about 110 years old;  it contains some seventy-
two  ship knees;  a few years  ago a local photographer named  Paul
 
.Abby  took  several  black-and-white  photographs  of  the  interior
 
i
rchitecture of Sacred Heart Church;  this is the church which Mr.
 
:irois  attends  and he  is very familiar with  its  resident priest,
 
Levasseur;  this house  is the last dwelling before you get to the
 
woods on the right-hand side of the road approximately 7-8 miles
 
out of Van Buren.
 
BUCKWHEAT  FLOUR  PRODUCTION:
 Mr.  Clement  Laplante  of  Van
 
Buren, Me.  owns a farm on which he grows buckwheat, which he mills
 
in  Grand  Falls
 (New  Brunswick)
 and  sells  for  fifty  cents  a
 
pound.

Site:  Saint-Basile,  New Brunswick
 
These fieldnotes describe a notebook interview with Mr. Claude
 
G. Bossé at his home in Saint-Basile, New Brunswick on the evening
 
of 3 July 1991.
 
CONTEXT:
 The  primary  purpose  of  this  visit  was  to  gather
 
information about Mr. Bossé's activities as the producer of "Votre
 
soirée  country"
 (a  weekly  community  cable  television  program
 
recorded in Rivière-Verte,  New Brunswick).
 
FIELD DATE:
 I called up Mr.  Bossé the last week of June to
 
set an appointment.  As he was about to leave for a short vacation,
 
we  arranged  for  me  to  visit  on  an  evening  during  the  following
 
week.
 
VISIT SYNOPSIS:
 I arrived at Mr.  Bossé's home at about 7:30
 
p.m..  Mr.  Bossé  greeted  me  at  the  door  and  ushered  me  to  the
 
kitchen table.  We  chatted  a few minutes  about  the Maine Acadian
 
Culture Survey and about his roles as producer, cameraman and chief
 
organizer  of  "Votre  soirée  country."  Mr.  Bossé  then  toured  me
 
through the mementoes, memorabilia, and honorific certificates and
 
plaques  (prominently displayed in the kitchen and the living room)
 
which he has received and collected over the years in association
 
with his work for this series. He also showed me his collection of
 
videocassettes,
 which  includes  a  complete  series  of  the  239
 
broadcasts of  the  show produced since  1981.
 We  returned to the
 
kitchen, where we chatted until approximately 9:00 p.m., whereupon
 
I took my leave.
 
LOCATION OF THE HOME:
 The Bossé home is  located at  316  Cyr
 
Street,  on a side  street  in the center  of the village of  Saint-
Basile.
 
DESCRIPTION OF HOME:
 Mr.  Bossé lives in a small mobile home
 
located at the end of a side street. A large Canadian flag flies on
 
a flagpole just outside the house.  The interior rooms which I saw
 
included  a small  kitchen  and  a modestly-sized,  carpeted  living
 
room.  The furnishings were plain, functional, spare, and tidy. The
 
principal decor on the walls of the living room and
 kitchen were
 
the  many  mementoes,
 honorific  certificates
 and  plaques,
 and
 
memorabilia  which  Mr.  Bossé  has  collected  over  the  years  as  a
 
result of his association with "Votre soirée country."

A longtime fan of French-Canadian country-and-western music,
 
Mr. Boss6 got the inspiration to start his own show after watching
 
"Stacey's  Country Jamboree,"  a television  series  from Maine.  He
 
made his studio debut in his own living room,  playing the records
 
over  his  sound  system  and  talking  about  his  favorite  French-
Canadian  singing  stars  while  the  video  camera  focussed  on  the
 
appropriate album cover.
 
Mr. Boss6 offered his homemade videocassettes for broadcast to
 
the local community cable network (TVCE

At the time of my visit, Mr. Boss6 had recently withdrawn from
 
I
'Votre
 soir6e
 country."
 His
 self-imposed
 resignation
 was
 
precipitated  by  the  decision  of  the  Rivi&re-Verte  Knights  of
 
Columbus  to  fire his production  staff.
 Mr.  Boss6  is  the moving
 
force  behind  the  program  and,  unlike  the  other  members  of  his
 
"team,"
 is
 under
 no
 obligations
 to
 the
 local
 sponsoring
 
organization.
 In his opinion,  the production staff do a fine job
 
and  he  is  not  interested  in  working  with  any  other  personnel.
 
Apparently,  Fundy Cable  10  attempted to put together an entirely
 
new  production  team  and  continue  the  program,  but  the  listener
 
response was so negative that the new broadcasts were cancelled and
 
Cable 10 has been showing re-runs from previous seasons  in their
 
stead.
 Mr. Bossé believes that if negotiations with the community
 
cable go as planned,  he will be back on the air next season with
 
his habitual  production  staff  and  a one-year  contract  for  their

Informant/Event:  Desrosier,  Connie Morin
 
Site:  St.  Agatha,  Me.
 
These fieldnotes describe a recording session and notebook
 
interview with Mrs.  Constance  (
"Connie")  Morin Desrosier at her
 
home in Saint Agatha,  Me.  on 8 July 1991.
 
CONTEXT:
 The primary purpose of this visit was to document
 
a sampling of songs and to gather related biographical and
 
musical background information from Mrs.  Desrosier.
 
PRIOR CONTACT:
 I first met Mrs.  Desrosier at a meeting of
 
the Ste. Agathe Historical Society in September of 1991.
 During
 
that meeting,  I expressed my interest in folk arts; Mrs.
 
Desrosier mentioned that her father had been a singer and that
 
she remembered a few of his songs.
 Later that fall,  Mrs.
 
Desrosier became a student in a beginning fiddle class for adults
 
which I offered through the University of Maine at Fort Kent,  and
 
she has continued to enroll in two subsequent fiddle class this
 
year.  Since then,  I have also met her husband Lucien.

Connie lived at home until she married,  at age nineteen,
 
with Lucien Desrosier.
 She described her husband as a farmer at
 
heart who took a mill job at Fraser Paper Mills  (Madawaska,  Me.)
 
to support the family.
 Lucien worked at Fraser as a machine
 
repairman for thirty years;  he supplemented the family income by
 
working as a butcher in Frenchville,  Me.
 Lucien and Connie
 
raised their ten children in the house which they built with wood
 
from a woodlot owned and cut by Lucien.
 
CONNIE MORIN DESROSIER -- JOB HISTORY:
 As her children grew
 
older,  Connie began substitute teaching at the local school.
 She
 
began taking summer and night courses in Education at the
 
University of Maine and eventually went on to complete her
 
college education and teacher's certification,  graduating cum
 
laude in 1972.
 After teaching first grade in Frenchville,  she
 
worked for fourteen years at the high school level in Madawaska.
 
For the last several years,  she has been librarian at the Dr.
 
Levesque School  in Frenchville,  and plans to retire in 1992.

the five chil d
r e n.
 
Four years after the death of his first wife,  Eddie
 
remarried his wife's cousin,  Wellena Fongemie.
 Around that time,
 
the Octave Cyr homestead,  which bordered on the Morin family
 
farmlands in Saint David,  became available because nobody in the
 
line of succession wished to farm.
 one of Eddie's brothers
 
called to give him the news,  and Eddie,  whom Connie described as
 
having always been a farmer at heart,  bought the seventy-acre
 
farm and moved his family to Saint David,  which he farmed until
 
his death.
 Ten children were born of the second marriage.
 
EDDIE MORIN -- SINGER,  DANCER,  STORY-TELLER:
 He came from a
 
music-loving family:  two of his brothers played fiddle,  another
 
played the harmonica,  and all six of the boys step-danced.  Connie
 
has no memory of her paternal grandparents  (Denis and Dorumen
 
Ouellette Morin)  singing or playing music,  but remembers them as
 
enjoying both;  her paternal grandparents'  home was a popular
 
gathering place for family and neighbors,  where music and dancing
 
took place.
 One of Eddie's first important source of songs was
 
his maternal grandfather Isidore  (
"Grandp6re Lindore")  Ouellette,
 
who lived with Denis and Dorumen.
 
Eddie later picked up a lot of songs in the winter lumber
 
camps  (primarily Allagash and Moosehead regions),  where he began
 
working as a hostler at the age of fourteen.  His first wife
 
Nettie was not a singer,  but both she and second wife supported
 
M 
Eddie's love of singing by writing down the lyrics of songs which
 
he wanted to learn  (at family and neighborhood gatherings where
 
songs were sung)  into notebooks and later coaching him on the
 
words.  Since Eddie neither read nor wrote,  this support was very
 
important.  Connie inherited some of these notebooks,  but they
 
have disappeared over the years,  as a result of having been lent
 
out and not returned.
 
Eddie's second wife Wellena Fongemie was a singer,  but
 
Connie's most vivid memories of singing on the maternal side
 
of the family are of her stepmother's mother,  Ad&le Ouellette.
 
Mrs.  Ouellette was born in Houlton,  Me.  and raised as an orphan
 
from the age of ten by the Tommy Michaud family of Fort Kent.
 
She played harmonica and sang a lot of songs.
 
Until the advent of television,  singing was a popular
 
entertainment,  especially whenever relatives gathered at weddings
 
(particularly after the official ceremonies),  during the Xmas
 
season,  and on the long winter evenings.
 During World War II,
 
there were sending-off parties and furlough parties where singing
 
was also popular and sometimes included local compositions
 
related to wartime experiences.
 
Eddie always sat in a rocking chair and rocked when he sang;
 
Connie vividly remembers her father rocking the baby to sleep at
 
home with his singing.
 Connie remembers her father as a gentle,
 
sentimental,  forgiving man with a sense of humor who was a fine
 
entertainer.  When Eddie sang a "lively" song  [Connie demonstrated
 
with a duple-meter chanson A r6pondre-type song]  he would tap his
 
feet  [Connie said that she couldn't duplicate the pattern but
 
immediately identified the pattern which I demonstrated as the
 
right one;  I used the standard percussive foot-tap pattern which
 
old-style French-Canadian dance musicians and singers use to
 
accompany quick-paced duple meter repertory].
 
Eddie was also a fine story-teller who enjoyed entertaining.
 
Many of his stories related humorous incidents which happened in
 
the lumber camps or related frightening tales about inexplicable
 
sightings or noises.  In later years,  when visiting in St.  Agatha,
 
he would sometimes take the truck and go to the local barber shop
 
and entertain the customers with his stories.
 Eddie gave such a
 
fine show that the barber shop would fill up and stay open well
 
after normal hours.
 
Eddie was also a fine step-dancer with a repertory of fancy
 
"giguell steps.
 Connie believes that he picked up steps from his
 
family and at the lumber camps.
 
CONNIE MORIN DESROSIER -- MUSICAL BACKGROUND:  Connie
 
inherited her love of singing and her songs from her father
 
Eddie.
 Of the sixteen children in the family,  she believes that
 
she is the only one who learned her father's songs.
 One of her
 
brothers,  Edouard  [in his early fifties and living in Hebron,
 
Ct.],  sings western songs and plays harmonica.
 For some years,
 
Connie had an old piano at her home in St.  Agatha,  which she
 
played by ear.
 That piano was eventually hauled to the dump.
 In
 
1991,  Connie began taking weekly fiddle classes through
 
University of Maine at Fort Kent's continuing education program.
 
CONNIE MORIN DESROSIER -
-
 SONG REPERTORY:  Although we
 
focussed on the songs learned from her family,  Connie's repertory
 
also includes Cahier de la bonne chanson repertory learned at
 
school and songs learned in the church choir.
 She didn't
 
remember knowing or having heard any lullabies as a child;  she
 
said her father used to sing the children to sleep with the
 
ballads.
 
Connie also didn't remember learning any French-language
 
children's songs informally.
 When I questioned her as to the
 
cause,  she replied that when she was attending school,  speaking
 
French was forbidden on school property except during the bi-
weekly French class.
 The Daughters of Wisdom sisters and lay
 
teachers at Saint Thomas Convent  (Madawaska,  Me.)  taught the
 
children the standard English-language children's song primer
 
repertory and also taught the children songs from the Cahier de
  
la bonne chanson during French class.  Connie doesn't remember
 
having informally learned any singing or dancing games from other
 
children;  she pointed out that,  with so many chores to do at home
 
after the school day,  there was little time for play.
 
CONNIE MORIN DESROSIER -

 PRESENT-DAY SINGING STYLE AND
 
PRACTICE:  Connie's family repertory and her singing style are in
 
many ways characteristic of the older traditions of French
 
balladry in Canada and the northeast United States.
 Like her
 
father,  she prefers to perform sitting in a comfortable chair.
 
She sings in a soft,  well-modulated contralto voice.
 Her
 
delivery is relaxed with no dramatic inflections or gestures.
 
The melodies which I heard her sing contain relatively little
 
ornament or melisma.  She sometimes hesitates a bit while singing,
 
but this is probably a matter of not having enough opportunities
 
to practice.
 
Although Connie Morin Desrosier cherishes her father's
 
repertory,  opportunities for keeping the repertory in mind are
 
few indeed.
 All the family members of her father's generation
 
are dead,  so she can't look to them for help.  Furthermore,  none
 
of her own sisters or brothers and none of her own children took
 
up the family songs.
 The disappearance of the family song
 
notebooks eliminated an important source for reinforcing memory.
 
At the moment,  her active repertory seems to be fairly
 
restrained.
 
Nonetheless,  Connie can sing several fine songs from memory.
 She
 
enjoys opportunities to get together and sing with other older
 
local singers,  and when she does so,  she often finds herself
 
recollecting songs which used to be in her active repertory.
 
My visit to Mrs.  Desrosier seems to have provided a first
 
opportunity for her youngest child,  Bill,  who spent the morning
 
with us,  to hear his mother sing.  Bill seemed both surprised and
 
delighted by his mother's singing,  and mentioned several times
 
that he had no idea that she knew such songs.
 He also asked me
 
if I could make him a copy of the audiocassette of his mother's
 
songs which I taped.
 
OTHER SINGERS IN THE REGION:
 In res p onse to my request for
 
suggestions about other traditional singers in the region,  Mrs.
 
Desrosier suggested the following in

INTERVIEW INFORMATION:  [Taken from notebook interview]
 
IDA BOURGOIN ROY
 -
-
 LIFE HISTORY:
 Ida Bourgoin Roy,  born
 
in Stockholm,  Me.  on 17 April 1921,  is one of four children born
 
to Patrick and Alvina Marquis Bourgoin.
 During Ida's early
 
years,  her father worked as a blacksmith and lumber-mill
 
mechanic,  trades which kept the family on the move around
 
Aroostook County:  to Caribou,  when Ida was four,  and then
 
Houlton,  two years later.
 
During these early years,  the Bourgoin family lived in
 
predominately non-French-speaking communities,  and the children
 
became unilingual English speakers,  even though they understood
 
French.  Ida commented that until the age of eight,  she never
 
spoke French,  even at home with her parents,  whose first language
 
was French.
 The parents spoke French to the children;  the
 
children replied in English.
 
When Ida was eight,  Patrick Bourgoin moved his family back
 
to the paternal farmlands in the Flat Mountain region of St.
 
Agatha, Me.  Ida remembers her mother announcing to the children
 
that the family was moving to a French-speaking community and
 
that they would have to learn French.
 Alvina began her
 
instructing her children that same evening by saying the Rosary
 
in French,  instead of English as was their custom.
 Ida remembers
 
she and her brothers and sisters struggling through the Rosary
 
that first evening,  tongue-tied and giggling.  She also remembers
 
the loneliness she experienced initially in St.  Agatha,  before
 
she learned enough French to communicate comfortably with
 
neighbors and peers.  Eventually,  however,  Ida learned to speak
 
the local French fluently.
 
Ida's formal education came to an end at the sixth grade;
 
family farm responsibilities and the long walk to school were
 
primary causes.
 She helped out on the farm and became very
 
skillful at knitting and crocheting.
 Ida lived at home until the
 
age of twenty,  when she married Rosaire Roy,  a local farmer's
 
son.
 She and her husband spent one year in Stockholm,  then
 
settled in Daigle,  Me.,  where Ida lived for some thirty years.
 
When the youngest of the eight Roy children was four,  Rosaire
 
died.
 Ida kept the family together,  supporting her children by
 
working as a cook and domestic and by crocheting professionally.
 
In the early 1970's,  the family moved to Lille,  Me.
 
Ida recently moved to the Pine Tree Apartment complex.
 She
 
retired from her custodial and kitchen work a couple of years
 
ago,  due to a variety of health problems.  She continues to keep
 
up her crocheting,  supplying the Acadian Village  (Keegan,  Me.)
 
giftshop with a steady supply of beautiful baby clothes and
 
pichoux [my spelling;  a crocheted slipper].
 Ida also enjoys an
 
active social life and is involved in parish and community
 
activities.
 The week following my visit,  she performed at a
 
community talent show  (organized in conjunction with the Festival
 
de Grande-Rivière),  and travelled to Fort Kent,  Me.  to sing at an
 
Acadian supper.
 
IDA BOURGOIN ROY -

 MUSICAL LIFE:  Ida grew up in a music-
loving family.  Her father's family were all singers;  Patrick
 
Bourgoin was reputed to be one of the finest of his day.
 [Ida
 
mentioned that she believes that Roland Bélanger  (Frenchville,
 
Me.)  made some home disc recordings of her father's singing
 
around 1946-7.]  He also was an accomplished fiddler,  and played
 
harmonica and bombarde [
jew's harp].
 Ida's mother Alvina Marquis
 
Bourgoin was also a fine singer.
 
Homemade entertainment was the norm in the farming community
 
of Ida's youth.
 Story-telling,  card-playing,  dancing and singing
 
were favorite choices for family evenings at home and for the
 
veillées (house parties)  which celebrated and strengthened family
 
and community ties.
 
At eight years old,  Ida made her public performing debut,
 
when she and her sister Irene accompanied their father to house
 
parties where he sang and played the violin and they danced.
 
[Sister Irene lives in Black Lake in the Fort Kent region.]  Ida
 
identified four types of dance which she and her sister
 
performed:  Charleston,  Le petit bonhomme [squat-kicks],  qique
  
[step-dancing],  and tap dance.
 
By the time Ida married,  she had a considerable repertory of
 
songs and tales.  Ida remembers entertaining her children as well
 
as neighborhood youngsters with her story-telling.
 Neither her
 
husband nor any of her children shared her drive to perpetuate
 
the old songs;  in fact,  she remembers them complaining about her
 
constant singing.  Mrs.  Roy nonetheless kept her family and
 
community repertory in practice,  and added a considerable number
 
of original compositions  (in both French and English)  to her
 
repertory  [e. g.  "Je suis allée verser des larmes,  "Please Lord,"
 
"Notch Baby Song,"  "The Old Spruce Tree,"  "Ma petite fille,"
 
"Peace is Flowing through the Valley,"  "Comme vous savez,  c'est
 
la façon,"  "Tu es bien loin de moi mon enfant"].
 Mrs.  Roy tends
 
to borrow the melodies from familiar songs her original
 
compositions;  a practice typical of local song composition in
 
many cultures.
 
In 1972,  Roger Paradis,  history professor at the University
 
of Maine at Fort Kent,  began recording Mrs.  Roy's repertory
 
[According to information I've gathered in previous conversations
 
with Mr.  Paradis,  he recorded about 350 songs in her repertory,
 
the majority of which are presently deposited at the Archives de
 
folklore at Laval University  (Quebec City)].
 
Mrs.  Roy's experience as a fieldwork informant raised her
 
awareness of the importance of her singing heritage and
 
stimulated her interest in collecting her own materials.
 Over
 
the years,  that awareness has evolved into a passionate
 
- 
REPERTORY AND PERFORMANCE STYLE:  Mrs.  Roy's repertory of
 
French songs is vast and wide-ranging.  It includes old ballads
 
and lays,  locally-composed songs and complaintes, turn-of-the-
century sentimental parlor ballads,  comic music hall ditties,  and
 
original commemorative songs.  The songs which I have h e
a
rd  
h
e r
 
sing present a relatively spare melodic line with no
 
ornamentation except for an occasional slide.  She tends to sing
 
at the
