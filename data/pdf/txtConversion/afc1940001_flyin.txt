And being young and innocentAnd beauty on me smiled.My parents [doted?] on me,For I was their
only child.
[????]Dec1938
2 So with my parents grew upIn Waterford's [own?] townThey bound me to a cooperBy the name of
William Brown.I served him long and faithfullyFor eighteen months or more.Then I went on board of
theOcean Queen,Bound for New Britain's shore. copied 3. Twas in the City of [?]I fell in with Captain
[Moore?],The owner of the Flying CloudFresh from a distant shore,So kindly he invited meon a
slaving voyage to goto the burning shores of Africa.Where the sugar-can doth [ does?] grow.4. The
Flying Cloud is as [ [??]?] afine a ship,As ever sailed the main,with her sails as white as thedriven
snow,On them no spot nor stain - Ihave often seen that gallantbark!When the wind blew off her

("Of course I don't knowwhat this all means, butit's sure enough the way the[gong?] goes," says
[EWE?]) 5. About a [?] after that - Weset out from [Afric's?] shoreWith eighteen-hundredof those poor
soulsto be slaves forever more.We lived then upalong [?] decksAnd stored them down below,till
eighteen inches to a manwas all we could allow.6. Then with our cargo we set sail,upon a Monday
morn,It had been better forthose poor souls.If they had ne'er been born.For a plague of fever,came
on boardAnd swept them half away,We lined their bodieson our deck,and threw them in the sea.
7. Twas but a few weeksafter that,We reach the Cuban shore,and sold them to theplanters there,to
be slaves forever more.The rice and coffee there to hoe,Beneath a burning sun,To lead a sad
andmournful life,until their career was run.8. And when our moneywas all spent.We went to sea
again,Then Captain Moore, hecame on deck,And said to us his men,"There's gold and silverto be
had,If you with me agree,We will hoist aloftA pirate flag.And scour the raging sea" Flying Cloud9.
We all agreed excepting [?]and those return to landTwo of these were English boysAnd two from
New Found land,The other was an Irish lad,His home was in [trimore?],How oft' I have wishedI had
joined those boys,And stayed with themon shore.10. We robbed and plundered[many?] a ship
down on theSpanish Main.Caused many a mans, - poor wife'sheart to break,When he came not
again.We caused them all towalk the plank,Their prayers of no avail.For the saying of our Captain
was"A dead man tells no tales". 11. And we were chased bymen of war, liners, andfrigates, too,But

12. Cont.to here we gave no answer,As we steered before the wind.Til a chance shotcut our

her side,And soon across ourquarter-deck.There flowed a Crimson tide,We fought til Captain
Moorewas slain,And eighteen of his men,When a bursting shellSet our ship on fireWe were forced
tosurrender then."There! I like a song tomake sense! 14 To Newgate prison we were sent,Bound
down in iron chains,For the plundering of manya ship,Down on the Spanish Main,Twas drinking
andbad company.That made a wretch of me,Come all young peoplea warning take,And beware
of piracy.15 Farewell to dear old IrelandAnd the maid that I adore,Your voice like gentlemusic.Will
charm my heart no more.No more I'll kiss here ruby lipsOr press her lily white handFor I must die
aShameful deathAll in a foreign land.
