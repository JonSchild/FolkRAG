WHAT THE BEST CRITICS THINK OF SOL SMITH RUSSELL. 
To give the readers of this book some specimen criticisms on Mr. Sol 
Smith Russell's performances, we publish the following 
SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT. 
Bcerox, Feb. 1, 18,6. 
THE Redpath Lyceum Bureau has the honor to announce that they 
have secured, for a 
short season of two weeks in Beethoven Hall, one 
of the choicest and most delightful drawing- room entertainments ever 
given in this city. 
It comprises the well-known and niiiveniallv popular 
Berger Family and Sol Smith Russell, the famous humorist, who is too 
great a 
favorite here to need special mention. * * * * We append a 
few 
notices of hist night's performance, taken from the morning's papers. 
From the 13o$ton Journal. 
BEETHOVEN FIALL.—An 
entertainment more varied in character, and 
yet more refined. artist i
c, and thoroughly sati.sfactory in every particular 
than that Oven by the Berger Family and Sol Smith Russell's Concert 
Company at Beethoven Hall last night, has never been witnessed in this 
city. 
There was an ar.dience at once large and brilliant, as such things 
go this season, and a 
happier tis.eitiblage was never seen. 
Sol Smith 
Russell, who appeared several times during the course of the evening, 
was received with tremendous enthusiasm, and his inimitable comic per-
formances kept the house in almost a 
continuous roar of merriment 
Mr. Russell is a 
humorist without being a 
buffoon, and while his inter-
pretations of eccentric character are amusing to the last dezree, they are 
wholly free from objectionable taint. 
To his inimitable pen4onations of 
"Dorcas Pennyroyal," the old farmer whose town-meetine eloquence is 
directed " agin the new Auk-ton:se." Tommy Dobbs. who grinningly 
read5 his remarkable composition on 
The floss," and the boy who 
"stood on the burning deck. - he has added narrierons character sketches 
of a 
comic cl-,cription, and one at lmst of a 
graver nature. 
This latter 
is a 
capital imitation of John B. Gough. The noted temperance orator's 
style of delivery is copied with singular exactness, but there is no attempt 
at facial 
make-up." and one of that gentleman's most effective narra-
tives is told as well as he himself might Len H. 
The musical elements of the company are all of the best class. 
The 
13.e•reer Family Pallor Orchestra is an organization of ten accomplished 
musicians, svven ladies and three gentlemen. 
The same persoas. at 
another stage of the entertainment. appear as the Berger Silver Cornet 
Band, and at another. six of the number give a 
superb performance of 
bell rino-in7. 
Miss Annie Bcr,er. who is at the bead of this talented 
combination, is a 
cornet soloist of really great ability, and she also 
appears in the character of a 
set-to-comic Nocalist. 
Miss Annie Morgan 
is another vocalist of the party. and Mlle_ Emma tila:sy displays re-
markable skill as a 
violoncello •soloist.. * * .'.C.ariy every I

that captivated all listeners, add the effects possessed a 
quality peculiar 
to this organization. * * * * * 
But .the devoted head for which the 
good-sized audience reserved its choicest honors was that of the supreme 
Boston favorite, Mr. Sol Smith Russell, and his appearance was productive 
of a 
storm of applause, which he responded to in his inimitable vein. It 
would be superfluous to indicate the character of the entertaiment which 
he is accustomed to give, and which he gave last night. 
It is enough to 
say that he appeared three times and gave some of the most highly hu-
morous selections in his rich and varied repertory. He holds the mirror 
up to some of the more comical phases of life and eccentricities of 
character with a 
fidelity that charms and cannot be questioned. 
He is 
one of the most skillful, versatile, and at the same time refined delinea-
tors of character that this or any other country can produce, and his 
popularity rests upon a 
basis that cannot be shaken. * P * *. 
From the Daily Evening Traveller. 
BEETHOVEN HALL.— The Berger Family and Sol Smith Russell.—ThiS 
concert troupe made its first appearance at Beethoven Hall last evening, 
and judging from the applause bestowed by a 
large and cultivated audi-
ence, evidently made a 
decided and most favorable impression. 
The 
programme was full of good things, and the entertainment, as a 
whole, 
was an exceptionably excellent one. 
The overture by the Berger Family 
Parlor Orchestra, composed of ten performers (seven ladies and three 
gentlemen), violins, viola, violoncello, cornet, French horns, trombone, 
harp and flute, convinced the audience that the musicians were above 
the average, the young ladies handling the instruments with a 
perfection 
that was quite wonderful. A ballad, " The Tide," was well rendered by 
Miss Annie Morgan, and then came a 
solo for cornet i 
piston (" Weber's 
Last Waltz ") by Miss Anna Teresa Berger. 
Considerable curiosity was 
manifested to witness the young lady's efforts, and as she passed to the 
variations of the waltz, which Were somewhat difficult, rendering them 
with a 
purity of tone and finish that was truly remarkable, the audience 
• bestowed the applause with a 
lavish hand, and she gracefully responded 
with one of the popular songs of the day, which was also enthusiastically 
received. 
Next came Sol Smith Russell with his famous character songs 
(followed later in the evening by his celebrated imitations), and when he 
stepped before the footlights he must have appreciated the fact that he 
had many friends in Boston, and that a 
liberal number of them were in 
attendance. 
The applause was hearty and long-continued, and the efforts 
of Mr. Russell to please were as successful as usual. 
He is an original, 
immensely and deservedly popular wherever he appears, for his imitations 
are unsurpassed, and he never allows himself to descend to anything that 
could give offence to the most particular of his auditors. * * * * * As 
stated above, the entire performance was enjoyable and refined, and de-
serves to be most liberally patronized during the two weeks that the 
troupe will remain at the hall. 
From the Boston Advertiser. 
THE 13Emism-Rcrsszst COMBINATION.—The merit of the entertainment 
given at Beethoven Hall last evening by the Berger family and Sol Smith 
Russell lies more in its novelty. 
There are bell-ringers, ladies who play 
on instruments usually monopolized by the male sex, and vocalists who 
are superior in their several professions to the members of the Berger 
but there are few that do so many things so well. 
For instance, 
Miss Anna Teresa Berger plays the first violin in the overture, performs 
a 
solo for the cornet, sings a 
few songs, and uses the silver bells with 
great dexterity. * * * * * Of Mr. Sol Smith Russell we do not need to 
speak. 
He is the best artist in his line that we have, and that because he 
has, in addition to a 
remarkable power of facial expression, the intelli-
gence and the brain to understand character and idiosyncracies which an 
ordinary observer would pass unnoticed.

WHO PUT THEM LN MY LITTLE BED ? 
AIR-=" Put Me in my Little Bed." 
Written by GEORGE COOPER for Sot, S3irra RUSSELL. 
On, landlord, I 
am tired now, 
I 
cannot bear to hear you talk; 
You've told your funny tales all day, 
So now I'll have to walk my chalk. 
I'm sleepy too, as you may see, 
Yet one queer thought is in my head: 
I 
want to ask you ere I 
go— 
Who put them in my little bed? 
CHORUS. 
Come, landlord, come, bid me good- night, 
My sleepy eyes are waxing red; 
Oh, if you love me tell me true— 
Who put them in my little bed 1 
A 
couch I 
wanted for myself, 
But found some strangers there, you see; 
What is the damage, landlord dear, 
To keep a 
whole menagerie 7 
A 
concert in the hush of night 
Is not my style, as I 
have said; 
A 
bugbear this has grown to be— 
Who put them in my little bed 7 
Come, landlord, etc. 
Dear landlord, listen now, I 
pray, 
Have pity on your weary guest; 
Oh, I 
must quickly from you flee, 
Unless you give this child a 
rest I 
You've heard of grasshoppers and sich, 
Potato bugs that farmers dread— 
Oh, do not turn away, but say— 
Who put them in my little bed I 
Come, landlord, etc. 
AT,T; IN

Or, " The Philosopher." 
Musical Variety Sketch.

CHARACTER. 
SIMON SLTBOOTS. A 
well-to-do, old fashioned business man of the present 
day. Sully aud comfortable. 
[SCENT. —A 
parlor in 1st E. 
Music for opening. 
Enter SLY-
BOOTS (during music), chuckling.] 
SLY.— Well ! 
well! well! Egad, I 
think the world is coming 
to an end. 
Have I 
toiled all these years of my life—and built 
up this splendid business out of a 
mere song as I 
may say 
to be told by my own children that I 
know nothing of the 
world, and am but a mere fool in all business transactions? 
By all that's funny! 
It makes me laugh! (Thinks.) If I 
was 
of a 
different temperament, it might make me cry! 
But I'm 
not made of such stuff as that! 
Why—I 
suppose— if I 
was to 
let them have their own way, we should soon see the sign of 
the old firm changed from " Slyboots and Sons" to " Slyboots 
and Father!" " Slyboots and Father ?" (Chuckling.) 
Well, 
well! 
Boys will be boys —and I 
suppose I 
was one of them 
myself once. 
Though it's a 
good many years ago. 
But no! 
(Reflecting.) 
In those days it was not the fashion for boys to 
advise fathers—but for fathers to teach and control sons. 
Young America hadn't been invented then. 
And there was 
less smoking cheap cigars and standing at street corners. Ahi 
times have changed since then. 
But not with me. 
No—no! 
Not with rue! 
I'm the same jolly old fellow I 
ever was. And 
if things do go a 
little askew sometimes— as they will with 
every one— few worry themselves less about the matter than I 
do. 
I 
look upou ever.% thing that happens as ALL Di THE W AY 
or A 
LLFE.

Repeat Symphony Ho. 1. 
Then proceed with 2nd verse. 
As age approached—I 
felt more wise, 
And took to myself a 
wife! 
But experience proved me still quite green;— 
For she caused me sorrow and strife. 
'Gainst my opinion,—right or not! 
She'd e'er have her last say; 
And like all women— large or small— 
She'd surely have her way. REFEA.m. -Ha, ha, &e.

LADS OF THE VILLAGE. 
While the Lads of the Village shall merrily, ah 
Sound their tabors, I'll hand thee along: 
And I 
say unto thee, that verily, ah! 
Thou and I 
will be first in the throng. 
Just then when the swain who last year won the dow'r, 
With his mates shall the sports have begun, 
When the gay voice of gladness resounds from each bower, 
And thou long'st in thy heart to make one. 
Those joys which are harmless what mortal can blame! 
'Tis my maxim that youth should be free; 
And to prove that my words and my deeds are the same, 
Believe me, thou'lt presently see.

TT-TV. MULLIGAN GUARD. 
By kind permission of HARRIGAN and HART. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1873, by NED ELtratiews, 
in the Office of the Librarian of tong,ress, at ‘v 
azdtington, D. C. 
Coropos ed and sung by HARRIGAN and H ART, with ingnense success, at the 
Theatre coraique, New York. 
WE 
crave your condescension, 
And we'll tell you what we know 
Of marching in the Mulligan Guards 
From the seventh ward below; 
And our Captain's name was Hussey— 
A 
Tipperary man— 
He carried his sword like the Russian Duke, 
Whenever he took command. 
CII0R17S. 
We shouldered guns, 
And marched, and marched away 
prom Jackson Street 
Way up to Avenue A. 
Drums and fifes did sweetly, sweetly play, 
As we marched, marched, marched in the Mulligan Guards. 
When the band play'd Garryowen or the Connemarro pet, 
With the rub, dub, dub, we marched in the mud— 
To the military step— 
With the green above the red, boys, 
To show where we came from; 
Our guns we'd lift, 
With the right shoulder shift, 
As we marched to the beat of the drum. 
We shouldered, etc. 
When we'd get home at night, boys, 
The divil a 
wink we'd sleep; 
We'd all set up and drink a 
sup 
Of whiskey, strong and neat. 
Then we'd all march home together 
As slippery as lard; 
The solid men would all fall in, 
And march in the Mulligan Guard. 
We shouldered, etc.

[SCENE. A 
street in 1st E. 
Music. 
Play Symphony of song. 
Enter JOE. 
Ile is dressed eery shabbely—almost in rags. Ile comes 
tin, stretching himself and yawning dreadfully.] 
JOE (rubbing his eyes). — Heigho ! I'm so tired! And I'm so 
lazy! 
I've got no work to do! 
And what's more, I 
don't 
want no work to do! 
What's de use o' work ? I 
never could 
see any. 
rother day Ole Massa, he sent me down to de 
Smithy to help at de anvil. 
It was nice and warm in dere! 
So I 
just curled myself up and laid out for a 
nap. Bym' bye, 
Massa come along— and he laid out for me! 
Golly, what a 
lickin' I 
did get, to be sure! 
But I'd stand dat sooner dan 
work. 
Says Massa, " Why, Joe," says he, " what are you do-
ing dere, you lazy rascal? What do I 
pay you for! Why are 
you afraid o' work " 
He afraid o' work, Massa?" I 
says. 
"I ain't afraid o' no work. 
Who says I 
am? Who's afraid ? 
Why, Massa, if I 
was afraid a 
work, do you think I'd lay 
down and go to sleep just by him?" Den Massa had to 
laugh--and— 
eh ! eh! (chuckling) dat's de way I 
gets over 'em. 
Day calls me Lazy Joe! and Yawning Joe! ( Yawns.) I 
knows 
Ise both. 
But I 
can't help it. 
For when I 
wants to work— 
why as de great pcet Shakespoke wrote—" a 
soft supperation o' 
sleep" gits over me and I 
can't. 
And dat's just what's de 
matter.

JUST TOUCH THE HARP GENTLY, MY 
PRETTY LOUISE. 
[Copyright, 1875, by ROBERT M. 
DEW ITT.] 
A SKETCH FOR ONE CHARACTER. 
[Scene, a 
cottage. 
As the curtain, rises the symphony of the 
song is played xery softly.] 
[Enter CHARLES; he looks inquiringly around hint, and 
when he sees the cottage expresses delight.] 
CHARLES.— 'Tis the place at last! 
Oh, what a 
fio-xl of 
pleasant memories rush upon me at this moment. 
There's 
the little garden where so often we have walked in happier 
days. 
Yonder is the green, shady lane, and the little white 
church on the hill. 
There is her window; and far away I 
see the soft glimmer of the stream, by which we used to stray 
and dream of the bright future that we deemed was in store 
for us. 
I 
wonder if she has forgotten me? They say that ab-
sence conquers love, and I 
have been away over the sea for the 
last five years. 
How well I 
remember the little parlor where 
we used to sit and chat in the lovely twilight. 
Then those lily 
fingers of hers used to fly over the strings of her harp, as she 
woke the sweet strains that I 
never can forget while life shall 
last. 
There seems to be no one at home. Even the birds are 
quiet. 
What would I 
not give to hear that touch upon the 
harp once more. 
It would tell me that I 
was not forgotten. 
[The symphony of the song is again played. CHARLES comes 
forward and sings.] 
Just touch the harp gently-, my pretty Louise, 
And sing me the songs that I 
love; 
They will call back the days when together we sat 
On the porch ' neath the nest of the dove. 
There was one that you sang, my pretty Louise, 
It brings fond recollections to me; 
You remember the mocking-bird mimicked it once, 
As it perched on the sycamore tree. 
Just touch the harp gently, my pretty Louise, 
Just touch the harp gently, Louise, etc.

.---{CoNnicuED.] 
[After the 1st verse is sung, the strain is taken up by a 
voice 
behind the scenes. 
CHARLES listens attentively.] 
I'll touch the harp gently, your loving Louise, 
And sing the old songs that you love; 
They'll recall the bright days when we played in the wood, 
And watched the birds flitting above. 
For each song that she sang, your pretty Louise, 
E'en now she remembers them well, 
For though we've been parted, they've lived in her heart, 
And sweet is the love that they tell 1 
[The song is taken up by both voices.] 
HE. 
Just touch the harp gently, my pretty Louise, 
Just touch the harp gently, Louise. 
Oh, touch the harp gently, my pretty Louise; 
And sing the old songs that I 
love; 
They will call back the days when togetner we sat 
On the porch 'neath the nest of tne dove.

She'll touch the harp gently, your pretty Louise, 
She'll touch the harp gently, Louise; 
She'll touch the harp gently, your pretty Louise, 
And sing the old songs that you love; 
They'll recall the bright days when we played in the wood, 
And watched the birds flitting above. 
[The refrain is repeated very softly as the curtain falls.]

LOUISE," with the Piano Accompaniment, is published by ROBERT M.

AIN'T YOU A Wk 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1874, by E. H. Thinnrso, 
in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington, D. C. 
The Miic of this song is published by E H. HARDING, 288 Bowery, New 
York. 
Price 10 cents. 
Written and composed by JOSEPH P. 
Srtzu.z. 
I 
TOOK my love one ev'ning, 
When the summer moon was beaming, 
Thro' silent arbors gleaming, 
Where Cupid has control ; 
I 
wanted to tell her 
How dearly I 
adored her, 
But oh, she would not listen, 
Tho' I 
tenderly implored her; 
Oh, love, oh, love, why don't you heed mel 
How can you treat me so 1 
In vain, in vain, in vain, 
She heeded not my pain; 
She turned away her head, 
And this was all she said— 
CHORUS. 
Oh, ain't you awful; 
It's wrong you know to love me so, 
Yes, you are awful; 
Your like I 
ne'er did see; 
Oh, ain't you awful ; 
It's wrong you know to love me so, 
Dear me, you're horrid; 
Why don't you let me be 7 
To make my feelings clearer, 
I 
advanced a 
little nearer, 
And said I'd like to hear her 
Say yes, and ease my mind ; 
She fumbled and mumbled, 
And laughed at my attention ; 
She said mamma would scold her, 
If such things she dared to mention; 
" 
Come, love," I 
cried, " we'll run away, 
And leave your mamma behind." 
" 
Oh, no, oh, no," she said. 
" 
Don't ask me now to wed; 
What would the people say 
If we should run away 7" 
Oh, ain't you awful, etos. 
7\. 
AIN'T YOU AWFUL.—Oontinued. 
She talked on useless matters, 
Till my patience was in tatters, 
Just as a 
woman clatters, 
When silent she should be; 
I 
begged her to listen, 
And drew her close beside me; 
But she began to fidget, 
And her roguish eyes defied me, 
And soon she told me with a 
smile 
That she did not care for me; 
My love was all in vain, 
She heeded not my pain, 
She turned away her head, 
And this was all she said— 
Oh, ain't you awful, eta. 
A HANDFUL OF TURF. 
As sung by ED 
BURTON. 
IT'S sailing I 
am at the dawn of the day 
To my brother that's over the sea, 
And it's little I 
care for my life anywhere, 
For ' tis breaking my poor heart will be; 
But a 
treasure I 
take for old Ireland's sake, 
And I'll pledge all belonging above, 
'Tis a 
handful of turf from the land of me birth, 
From the heart of the country I 
love. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
Then won't that poor lad in his exile be glad, 
When he sees the bright present I 
bring? 
And won't then the flowers in their elegant bowers 
Breathe forth the perfume of spring 7 
Oh, Erin, Machree though it's parted we'll be, 
'Tis a 
blessing I 
leave on your shore, 
Though your mountains and streams I 
will see in my 
dreams, 
Till I 
cross to old Ireland once more. 
(Repeat as before.

SOLID DISHES TO THE FRONT. 
[Copyright, 1875, by ROBERT M. 
DENVrrr.] 
A SKETCH FOR THREE CHARACTERS. 
[Beene, a 
room. 
Enter HUNGRY JAKE and JIM.] 
HUNGRY JAKE.—I 
can't go any further on an empty stom-
ach. I 
haven't smelt of a 
square meal for the last six months. 
Free lunches on the island aint what they're cracked up to be. 
Oh, dear! I'm hollow. 
.1-rm.—Oh, come along. 
You're always growling. 
Why, it 
isn't three days yet since you had a 
peanut. 
HUNGRY JAKE.—I 
want something more nourishing. 
I 
would like to tackle a 
cow or an elephant. 
JIM.—Brace up. 
We can get a 
good square meal here if 
you only do as I 
say. 
This is the gentleman's house who ad-
vertised in this week's Clipper for two artists in the singing 
line. 
HUNGRY JAKE.—We look more in the Sing-Sing line. 
Oh, 
dear 1 
if I 
only had the cover of a 
herring box, or an old India 
rubber shoe. 
JIM.--There you go again. 
Brace up, now, here comes the 
gentleman. 
[Enter Mn. JOHNSON.) 
JIM.—Good morning, sir. 
HUNGRY JAKE.—Good morning. [Aside.] I 
hope he'll say 
"eat." 
Mn. JOHNSON.— Good morning, gentlemen. 
You have 
called, I 
presume, about the advertisement. 
Juu.—Yes; Lny friend and myself have just left our cha-
teaux, and wish to accept of your situation merely for amuse-
meat, and more to pass away time than anything else. 
HUNGRY JAKE (
aside).—Just left our chateaux! 
That's the 
first time I 
ever heard the island called by that name before. 
M. JOHNSON.—Well, gentlemen, what is the style of your 
voices, bass or tenor? Or do you play ? 
HUNGRY JAKE (
aside).—I'd like to play with a 
knife and 
fork. 
JI.M.—My 
friend here is just from the Conservatory at Paris, 
and is a 
tenor of very superior abilities. 
(

SOLID DISHES.—{ComizarED.] 
JOIIIISOX.—Indeed! 
HUNGRY JAKE.—Yes, 
sir. 
[Aside.] 
I wish he'd say 
" 
food." 
Mn. JOHNSON.—And yourself? 
JIM.—Oh, I'm a 
bass. 
HUNGRY JAKE (
aside).—Base enough for anything. 
MR. JOHNSON.—Well, gentlemen, if you will just sing a 
song or an aria, merely to show me the style of your respect-
ive voices, we will adjourn to the dining- room. 
HUNGRY JAKE (
leaning against Jut, aside).—Oh my, he 
said eat 1 It takes away my breath. 
JIM.—What composition shall we sing, sir ? 
Mn. JOIENSON.—Oh, suit yourself. 
Something from the old 
masters. 
Beethoven, Mozart, or anything classical. 
Jut.—Humph I [Aside to HUNGRY JAKE.] 
Now, Jake, 
do your best. 
HUNGRY JAKE.—I 
can't sing on an empty stomach. 
0 
Lord! 
Mn. JOH-NBC:IN.—All attention, gentlemen. 
[ffins-GRY JAKE and JIM strike attitudes, and with a 
great 
decd of preliminary rnarkeuvring they suddenly commence the 
song," Solid Dishes to the Front." MR. JOHNSON is horrified, 
and endeavors to stop them. 
Failing to do so he exits, and re-
turns with a 
policeman who claps handcuffs on them, and takes 
them of They go, singing the chorus at the top of their voices.]

Don't imagine you'll meet with a

THAT'S WHERE YOU MAKE —[CoNoLuins.1 
Do not fancy you'll meet with a 
cabby, 
Who more than his fare will not take, 
May as well think an oyster could crawl up a 
tree, 
And there you would make a 
mistake. 
If you fancy a 
girl dislikes a 
small kiss, 
You must be—what some folks call—a 
take/ 
If you think your collector of taxes won't call. 
That's where you make the mistake. 
Don't imagine a 
man has no coin in his purse, 
Because he's not dress'd as a " swell," 
A 
book with a 
cover that's olden and worn 
Has often a 
good tale to tell. 
You'll oft see a 
swell, all collar, and cuffs 
To his finger-tips, white as snow-flake, 
But if you believe he's all over alike, 
That's where you make the mistake. 
The ladies still wear an abundance of hair, 
'Tis a 
wonder their deer necks don't break, 
But if you imagine they grow it themselves, 
That's where you make the mistake. 
When courting, don't write spooney letters 
To your fair one, for love, nor for sport, 
For should you but break any promise, 
They are sure to be read out in court. 
When you wed, do not marry the famly as well, 
For that will not a 
paradise make; 
Above all, close the door to your mother-in-law, 
Or—that's where you'll make the mistake. 
But—talking of marriage—reminds me, 
We've given the Germans a 
shake: 
They fancied Louise and her cash was for ti,erri, 
That's where they made the mistake. 
Don't imagine yom: milk is not " doctored," 
Nor quite pure is your two-
shilling tea, 
Don't imagine it's awfully jolly, 
The first time you go on the sea. 
Don't reckon your chicks before hatched, or 
Your duck may p'rhaps turn out a 
drake, 
Don't go and eat mustard, and fancy it's jam, 
Or that's where you'll make the mistake. 
'With all th, ndvice I 
have given, 
Yol ought to be well wide-awake, 
Lud should you imagine I'll sing any more, 
Ihgt's where you make the mistake.

THE O'SHATJGH-NESSY GUARDS. 
Written by Wm-um W ELCH. 
As sung by Mrs a 
Anen RICHMOND and Renal. K EUSELL. 
Two brave boys in our new uniform, 
Proud are we when we shoulder our guns; 
We see flags and banners floating, 
As we go marching down Broadway. 
Then right face about. (Sytnp.) 
CHORUS. 
Then we hear the drums a-beating, 
And the music sweetly play, 
As we go marching down Broadway 
Upon St. Patrick's day-ay-ay! 
We are out on a 
parade do you see, 
Cousin Mike and me— 
We'll march away, we'll march all day, 
Come and join our company. 
The beautiful girls all throng the sidewalk, 
And wave their hands to our company; 
They always throw us wreaths and bouquets, 
And give three cheers for Biddy and I. 
Then right face about. 
Then we hear, etc. 
Now come, all young men, that's fond of fighting, 
And roll your names in our company; 
All sorrows and woes we'll send a-kiting, 
And fight for fun and liberty. 
Then WE hear, etc.

For a

Why, its better than all the tears 
That a

And there's nothing so good as a 
laugh, 
It's a 
charm for the darkest ills, ha ! ha! 
And it lightens the doctor's bills, ha! ha! 
Why it's food, and it's sun and it's air, hal ha! 
And it drives to the wall old care, ha! ha!

For a

Why there's laughter in every thing, 
In the rivers, and birds that sing ; 
And there's nothing so good as a 
laugh! 
Don't be moody, and grow so thin, ha! ha! 
If you ne'er tried a 
laugh, begin, ha! ha! 
So laugh, and you'll soon confess, ha! ha! 
That your shadow will not grow less, ha! ha !

2. A 
young man courts a 
pretty girl, 
And fancies she adores him; 
But when he thinks the game is won, 
With some one else away she'll run; 
Of course, he'll swear he doesn't care, 
Although it nearly floors him, 
And all the while he seems to smile, 
It goes against the grain. 
Cho.—He'll fit the cap, &c. 
3. Old maids, who don't deny their age 
Is something over thirty, 
May say they hate the sight of men, 
But still we find them now and then, 
At half a 
chance return a 
glance, 
And some get gay and flirty; 
Which shows, if they still single stay, 
It goes against the grain. 
Cho.—They fit the cap, &c. 
4. The vile garotters, when they're caught, 
And that is none too often, 
Are now rewarded with the cat, 
They very much object to that, 
And if some say its not the way, 
Their brutal hearts to soften, 
It makes them yell, so we can tell 
it goes against the grain. 
Cho.—But they fit the cap, ,te. 
5. Since Nelson's day upon the sea, 
We've changed our style of fighting; 
Still the brave blue jacket lads, 
Cooped inside the ironclads, 
Are just as game, and true of aim, 
When wrongs require a 
righting; 
As every foe must know, although 
It goes against the grain.

THE TIMID AWKWARD SQUAD. 
Words and Music by (ho. G. Hear. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1874, by E. 
H. 
HARDIMN 
in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington, D. C. 
The Music of this song is published by E. H. HARDING, 288 Bowery, New 
York. Price 10 cents. 
YE 
may talk about your " Mulligan Guards," and " Regular 
Army, Oh !" 
I 
never shall forget the day I 
started for to go 
And be a 
bold milishee boy, so happy, gay and free, 
In the gallant " Sixty-Ninth," I 
jined the ranks of Company 
"G;" 
They put me in the " Awkward Squad," wid about a 
dozen 
more, 
Wid a 
musket on me shoulder, sure they made me walk the 
floor! 
We march'd unto the right and left, until me feet were sore, 
When we were in the timid " Awkward Squad." 
-r 
CHORUS. 
" 
Lift! 
Lift !" the sargint used to say, 
" 
Now ye's have it! can't ye keep it I 
Turn yer head this way! 
Right about! 
Sboulder arms!" 
An hour every day, 
Whin we were in the timid " Awkward Squad.", 
I 
found it very diffikilt to kape the step at all 
Along wid all the others whin paradin in the Halt 
At aich mistake I 
used to make, the sargint he would say : 
" 
Yer as awkward as the divil; doan't ye hould per gook that 
way!" 
(1) 
THE TIMID AWKWARD SQUAD.--Continued. 
Whine'er he'd spake an ordher but egad! ' twas wid a 
vim; 
I 
often wish'd, upon my soul, to put a 
head on him. 
But he at least weigh'd twenty stone, while I 
was very slim, 
From marching in the timid " Awkward Squad." 
" 
Lift! 
Lift!" etc. 
Whin we're considered compliant, into the company 
They'll put us in the ranks at wanst, and there they'll let us be; 
And undher sargint's orders thin no longer we will plod, 
Shouldher arms, and counter marehin' in the timid " Awkward 
Squad." 
Whin out into the strate we go to have a 
foine parade, 
We'll be looked upon wid pride, me boys, by every servant 
maid; 
And wid the sargint on our right no more we'll be afraid, 
Of marching in the timid " Awkward Squad." 
" 
Lift ! 
Lift!" etc. 
If ever I'm promoted, and a 
Gineral I 
be, 
I'll make ' em feel me vingeance, all the sargints under ma I 
I'll have ' em marchin' ivery day, or carryin' the hod, 
For being so uncivil to the timid" Awkward Squad." 
And if they should retallyate or give me any talk, 
I'll rejuce thim to the ranks at wanst, and there I'll make ' ets 
walk I 
If that ain't punishment enough" like any other gawk," 
Gad, I'll put them in the timid " Awkward Squad." 
" 
Lift! 
Lift!" etc.

By THOMAS lloorm. 
Hew dear to me the hour when daylight dies, 
And sunbeams melt along the silent sea; 
For then sweet dreams of other days arise, 
And mem'ry breathes her vesper sigh to thee. 
And, as I 
watch the line of light that plays 
Mong the smooth wave tow'rd the burning west, 
I 
long to tread that golden path of rays. 
And think 'twould lead to some bright isle of rat.

MY OWN SAIREY ANNE.—Concluded. 
She's just about as sweet, 
As any violet in the Spring, 
She's just like any nightingale, 
Whenever she may sing; 
She's like a 
little angel, 
Tho' she hasn't got the wings, 
In fact she's manufactured 
Out of all nice things! 
CH0.—And I'll never love another girl like my Sairey Anne, 
I 
couldn't love another one like my Sairey Anne, 
Until boiling water freezes, or oysters crawl up treeses 
I'll never love another girl like my Sairey Anne! 
If a 
Princess were to come 
And say " she would be mine," 
I'd say " I'm very sorry man], 
I 
really must decline." 
With a 
Princess I 
might live on 
Turtle soup, and Fricassees, 
Bt 
I'd rather have my Sairey Anne, 
And humble bread and cheese. 
CH0.—No 
I'll never love another girl like my Sairey Anne, 
I 
couldn't love another one like my Sairey Anne. 
I'm a 
very chilly soul, there. I'd rather find the Pole, 
But I'll never love another girl like my Sairey Anne! 
Her parent he's an old cross-grained, 
Cantankerous Kangaroo! 
He's often said he'll break my head, 
Which I 
don't want him to do; 
He won't let Sairey marry, till 
She reaches forty-five, 
So I'm bour:d to keep a " spinster," 
Until that time does arrive. 
CHo. — For I'll never love another girl but my Sairey Anne, 
I'll never love another one but my Sairey Anne, 
I'd sooner commit Bigamy, or Trigamy. or thing-a-my, 
But never love another girl like my Sairey Anne! 
N. B. A 
fresh third line may be introduced to encore choruses, thus:-
'I'd be a 
Cabby, " green" at dodges, and drive old Mother 
Frodgers."

THE FUNNY LITTLE TAILOR. 
Composed and sung by PAT KELLY. 
THERE was a 
jolly tailor once that I 
knew well, 
He kept a 
little tailor shop and had pantaloons to sell, 
Neck-ties, broadcloth, and everything like that, 
And anyone could tell he wore a 
very funny hat; 
It wasn't very low nor it wasn't very high, 
It had a 
peculiar look that would quickly take the eye. 
He wore it on Sunday and every day in the week, 
And it always looked glossy, for he kept it very neat. 
He was the pride of the ladies and the envy of the boys; 
Wherever he would go he would never make a 
noise; 
He was as light on his feet as a 
canary on a 
tree; 
He was bashful, he was neat, and as happy as could be; 
Whenever there was a 
party he was sure to be there, 
With his tight pantaloons and glossy curly hair; 
He could talk, dance, sing, and wink, and everything like that. 
But no matter where he would go he wore his funny little hat. 
He went to a 
party one night where there was lots of fun, 
He got rather tired and sleepy from drinking rum and gum! 
They put him in the corner to have a 
little doze, 
When the boys found it out they put a 
cork on his nose, 
And they all yelled " Fire !" with a 
terrible shout; 
But he quickly jumped up and quietly put it out; 
He took his little hat and walked to the door, 
Ntid he bade them all good-byr.,, 
and they never saw him more. 
PATRICK'S DAY PARADE.

Price 40 cents. 
SAINT PATRICE was a 
gentleman, 
Sure his name we celebrate, 
And on the seventeenth ef March 
The Irish concentrate ; 
A bran-new hat on each man's head, 
And a 
green necktie that's newly made; 
The left foot first, then lightly tread 
In the Patrick's day parade; 
Then two by two away we go, 
Up Broadway through rain or snow, 
We'd face the divil, friend or foe, 
In the Patrick's day parade. 
CHORUS. 
We shout hurrah for Erin go bragh, 
And all the Yankee nation, 
Stars and stripes, and shamrock bright arrayed; 
The Irish shout, the girls turn out, 
To see the celebration; 
We march stiff as starch, 
In the Patrick's day parade. 
You should see the marshal on his horse, 
Like Napoleon Bonyparte, 
And as he rides along the line, 
He'd break each lady's heart, 
And if the rain should fall down then, 
We hoist our umbrellas Filch, 
For history states that Irishmen 
Are always warm and dry; 
Then two by two away we go, 
Up Broadway through rain or snow; 
We'd face the divil, friend or foe, 
In the Patrick's day parade. 
We shout hurrah, etc. 
Then here's success to Patrick's day, 
Though it comes but once a 
year, 
And though I'm not a 
drinking man, 
On that day I'd drink my beer; 
I'll wear the shamrock in my hat; 
The green, my boys, ' twill never fade, 
And march along with Dan an' Pat, 
In the Patrick's day parade; 
Then two by two away we go, 
Up Broadway through rain or snow; 
We'd face the divil, friend or foe, 
In the Patrick's day parade. 
We t
,liou: hurra:!, etc.

bear this in mind, Somebody's looking,love, pull down the blind. 
How loving we were! how cosy we'd chat 
'Bout one thing and Vother, and this thing, and that; 
With my arm round her waist, how cosy we sat, 
Like two little turtle doves perch'd on a 
tree; 
Such squeezing, and teasing, and pleasing we had, 
Such wooing, and cooing, to make our hearts glad; 
With laughing and chaffing I 
near drove her mad, 
But still she was awfully spooney on me: 
SPOREN:—Aud if that Soldier would only have left us alone, she would never 
have exclaimed :—cHoui:s. 
One night, for a 
change, we went to the Play, 
And when we got home she was awfully gay, 
She saw them make love, and so learn'd the way, 
The piece was " Claude Melnotte," and suited her fine; 
She call'd me her rose-bud, her duck, and her dear, 
She threw her arms round me, while fast fell each tear; 
She cried, oh, don't leave me, for sadly I 
fear 
You don't love me truly, say, will you be mine? 
SPOKEN :—Just at that moment a 
Policeman passed and she said :—Csonts. 
Our courting days o'er, at last we were wed, 
I 
oft bless the hour when to church her I 
led, 
I 
now call her Mary, and she calls me Ned; 
We're happy and loving, and never know strife, 
We've a 
line, handsome lass, and two noble boys, 
Trouble or sorrow ne'er us annoys; 
Of life we've the sweets, and while tasting its joys, 
Fm thankful. I'm bless'd with a 
good little wife. 
SroREN:—And should an angry word rise to my lips, with a 
mak :mile on 
her face she'll exclaim :—Cuouus.

do, 
2 
When first I 
met the firm of Green, 
'Twas on my journey down 
To spend a 
day at Rosherville, 
" 
Just like a 
swell from town." 
The Widow loved romantic scenes, 
And a 
squeeze on the sly: 
But when my arm went round her waist, 
The boy began to cry! 
SPOREN.—He declared I 
was hurting his Mamma, and would 
insist upon sitting between us. only fancy making love to a 
girl with a 
boy in the way, but, she said to him in a 
voice so sweet: 
Om—Tommy, make room for your Uncle, &c. 
3 
The mother told her loving son 
To watch the passing train, 
" 
But no," he said, " my Uncle Fred" 
Will kiss your hand again. 
The Widow blushed, a 
maiden blush, 
And I 
was not myself; 
For who could make love on a 
seat, 
In front of that young Elf? 
SPOKEN.— Yes. it would never do to make love bef6re the boy, and 
the Widow said—" Vot before the lent. "'red. not before the boy; just 
then we went under a 
tunnel, and she said: 
Cao.— Tommy, make room tor your Uncle, &c. 
4 In a 
snug retreat at Rosherville, 
I 
went down on my knees, 
And asked if she would fly with me 
Across the bright blue seas. 
She sighed, and said " You wicked man, 
But how about the child ? " 
And clasped him fondly to her breast, 
.While I 
the agony piled! 
SPOKEN.--/ said," 31Y Icn:ely of all lovely beings. let us fly to some 
foreign clime. where I 
eill protect you and your boy." 
She asswered, 
and said, " How about my little pie shop in Seven Dials?" " Oh 
Blownid,ury 
do you keep a 
pie shop I ' 
Cno.—Tommy, make room for your Uticlf.,., & c. 
rO 
TOMMY, MAKE ROOM FOR YOUR AUNTIE. 
Ata.--" Tommy, Make Room for Your Uncle." 
As sung by Miss JENNIE ituGuEs. 
Now Miss Fitzwilliam of Union Square 
Presents herself to you, 
And you may guess, when she is dressed, 
Of gents she knows a 
few ; 
A widower fell in love with me 
While riding in a 
train ; 
lie had his little boy with him, 
Who caused us both much pain. 
SPOKEN. — Yes, the confounded young urchin caused me a 
great 
deal of pain and sorrow, and the widower, his father, introduced 
me to the little boy as his auntie, and during the whole of the jour-
ney the father had to say— 
CFIORUS. 
Tommy, make room for your auntie, 
There's a 
little dear ; 
Tommy, make room for your auntie, 
I 
want her to sit here ; 
You know papa has got a 
cake, 
And that he'll give to you ; 
So don't annoy, there's a 
good boy, 
Make room for your auntie, do. 
When first I 
met this widower, 
'Twos on the journey down 
To spend a 
day at Long Branch, 
Just like a 
swell from town ; 
The widower loved romantic scenes, 
And a 
squeeze on the sly; 
But when his arm went round my waist 
The boy began to cry. 
SPOKEN.—He declared his papa was hurting me, and would in-
sist upon sitting between us ; only fancy making love to a 
girl 
with a 
little boy in the way; but his father said to him in a 
voice 
so sweet— 
Tommy, make room, etc. 
The father told his loving son 
To watch the passing train ; 
But no, he said, my dear papa, 
You'll kiss that lady again ; 
Of course I 
blushed a 
maiden blush, 
And he was not himself; 
For who could make love in a 
car, 
In front of that young elf? 
SPOKEN,— Yes, it would never do to make love before the boy, 
and when the widower pressed me I 
said " Not before the boy, sir 
—not before the boy "— just then we went under a 
tunnel, and— 
Tommy, make room, etc.
