ear Mr.  Lomax:
 
we appreciate your giving us a chance to consider your
 
proposal for classroom materials on cantometrics and
 
choreometrics.
 Unfortunately for your interests,  I' m
 
afraid that we would not find a sufficiently large
 
market for such materials to justify our investment
 
in them.
 
It is coincidental that today I had the pleasure of
 
screening again a film produced for us by Bernard Wilets
 
with the advice and counsel of Mrs.  Bess Lomax Hawes
 
DISCOVERING AMERICAN FOLK MUSIC is a handsome and effec-
tive film.
 We look forward to working again with
 
Mrs.  Hawes on Bernard's  film on playground chants and
 
songs.
 
I regret that we could not be more encouraging about your
 
proposal.
 Thank you for letting us consider it.
 
Cordially,

Dear Alan:

 Their films are produced, apparent
 
by a staff of independent film-makers of whom Bernard Wille
 
is one.

 This film,  according to th

send you Rx

 I don't think you v

 When these ballads were brought to the New World, Americans
 
began putting their own words and experiences in them,
 
as well as changirr  the melodies.
 Often these, emperiences
 
were uork-rd l
ltcd, having to do with the
 ngcrous but
 
exciting  occup tions that men worked at on the frontiers.
 
(Example, possibly a lumberjack version
 
of the UNF RTUNATE RAKE.)
 
We can trace the
 expansion of the United
 
States in these songs as they were carried west--
the occupations changing, but the sonEp re:iaining

hs well as  oving west, immigrants also moved south,
 
often along Appalachian mountaji

akes a different form.

 It is important to renieriber that folk-music is still with
 
us today.  New words are constantly being added t  the cid
 
ballads, words which have to do with with our experiences
 
today.  Here is a modern version of our balled, built
 
around the job of telephone linesman.

 During the time when American folk-music was being develcp d,
 
there were very few people in a very big land.  These people
 
tended to be lonel ,esrecially on the frontiers, and their
 
music was often sad.  Lut when t
i
liey got together, tear music
 
was
 ha: oy.  Let's listen to one tyne of soci a l song, an
 
answc
Ll  
r-Lack sorm-- a form which origins ted in E
land.
 
(Humorous answer-back song.)
 
8-
 So fr we have heard a htr:orous answer-back song and story telling
 
songs called ballads.
 Still another kind of song came from
 
L
ingland, a song in which feelings and emotions were s
ore im-
portant than the story.  These are called lyric songs.
 Let's
 
listen to a lyric song from Ireland, called SHIJLE  R0CN, that
 
enresses the feeling of sorrow.
 It is the lament of an I
-
--
Jag
 
girl for her lover who has gone off to '
sr, and  is s
 in
 
Gaelic, an early language of Ireland.
 
(
SHL
TLL !LCOL sun .)
 
9
-
 When this lyric song reached America, as you would e
:pect, different
 
words were put to it, words that told something of American expar-
iences.  This American version describes the sorrow of parting
 
as
 
a wife is left bv her husband to fight in the Revolutionary ,
Jar.
 
(bUTT R.ILic nIi L version.)
 
10-
 Sosietimes, when Americans liked a song, they would use the melody,
 
but chanc
re the mood completely.  Here is the same lyric song, so
 
melancholy in many of its versions, sung as a lively chidren's
 
song.
 It isinteresting to note that the ncnsense words are similar
 
in as md to the original Gaelic words.  The Gaelic words
 
have become the nonsense words

 The jmijcrsnts to America not only brought their
 
songs with them, but also their musical instruments.
 
These were the classical instruments of Lurope.  And
 
agOocLdea1 of classica1 music wa  played, eapecially
 
in the cities.
 Thomas Jefferson, for example,  :
es
 
a fine (
cellist) and played in string quartets
 
regularly.  But ordinary people, particularly people
 
who lived in the country;
 played their own music,
 
their folk music, on their instruments.

uropean culture is the emphasis i

group activit es.  In  uropean folk-music, you have
 
long songs for one singer, but in Africa the d

is based on group participation rather than solos.
 
This Afro-tradition was brought to the New World,

 What we just  heard was a spiritual-- a religious song
 
developed by black Americans out of  uropean hymns.
 The
 
emphasis on rhythm in spirituals can be traced back to
 
the complex rhythms of Africa.  In Africa, the drum

 Two great cultural streams, one from  nglandand  urope,
 
the other from Africa, have pro aundly influenced American
 
folk-music.
 
Practically from the beginning of  i

history,  these streams have flowed along, sometimes
 
side-b,
 sometimes mixing.
 Together they have
