Biographical Sketch 
OF 
J. M. Johnson and S. C. Swain. 
-employed as ramrod for a 
cannon in the beautiful spectacular 
piece of the " Frozen Feet, or The Busted Overshoe," 
in 
which capacity he remained during one scene, the cannon 
proving to be a worse kicker than himself. 
Mr. Johnson is 
also well known as the author of several popular ballads, 
among which may be mentioned the following: " Tate this 
Bald Wig to My Brother;" " Feed the Kittens, Mother's 
Drunk ;" and " Papa's Hair is Growing Moldy." Mr. Johnson 
is the most talented eater in America. 
MR. S. C. SWAIN. 
Mr. Swain was born in the county of Tr-la-la- b, Italy, just 
two years previous to the date of his birth, his mother being 
present on the occasion. 
His life has been an eventful One, 
and after what he has passed through we are satisfied that 
nothing short of an earthquake will kill him. 
When about 
seven weeks old he was apprenticed to a 
farmer, who used him 
for a 
churn-handle, which accounts for his creamy complexion. 
After serving three minutes under this master he ran away 
and made a 
living during the next two years by counting oats 
in a 
livery stable. 
His ambition, however, would not permit 
him to pursue so quiet a 
vocation. 
He next turned his atten-
tion to boating, and for considerable lengths of periods he 
gained a 
livelihood as a 
rudder for a ferry-boat. -This prov-
ing detrimental to his health he went to the Island of Madeira 
and succeeded, after many strug,gles, in obtaining a situation 
as a 
cork-box with a Portuguese combination known as the 
Sourits. 
After serving the required term he left that com-
pany and doubled up with Mr. Johnson's umbrella, knowing 
be could shut that up when he wanted to. 
Their success has 
enabled them to buy an interest in the Morgue, where they 
are now lying upon ice, waiting for identification. 
Mr. Swain 
is the author of tile following beautiful stanza: 
" 
My brother lies sick in the hospital, 
And he is a 
sight to behold; 
Give! Oh, give me some silver! 
If you can't give me silver give gold." 
Mr. Swain carries the hatchet for truthfulness. 
Managers 
please write immediately to New York Morgue, as we are 
:nearly frozen. 
Yours truly, 
J

WE'RE NOT CRAZY, BUT INSANE; 
Original by JOHNSON AND SWAIN. 
They say us nigs are crazy, but we're not, 
We're happy when we jump about and sing, 
We will show you all on this here very spot, 
In what funny shapes we nigs ourselves do fling. 
We learned to dance where the caneand cotton grow, 
You, our pickanniny antics we will show, , 
I your seats now all remain, and you'll see it's very 
plain, 
We darkies are not crazy, but insane. 
We could not stop our antics if we tried, 
We're the liveliest colored gentlemen in the State, 
At night-time to the bed-posts we are tied, 
For making fun we crazy nigs are great. 
You do not understand our funny ways, 
You think we are two wild lunatic jays, 
In your seats now all remain, and you'll see it's very 
plain, 
We darkies are not crazy, we're insane. 
WE LAY WAY OVER ALL. 
Written expressly for JOHNSON AND SWAIN, by JAMES F. 
DOOLEY, 
You have heard from nigs that hail from Alabama, 
And of other coons that come from Tennessee; 
But the article they raise in old Virginny, 
Is the greatest of them all, as you will see. 
We were born and bred on a 
big plantation, 
And could sing and dance when we were very 
And the folks all 'round would laugh at our ques-
tions, 
For they knew that we could lay clean over 'em 
all. 
CHORUS. 
Then do not be alarmed, my gay Caucassians, 
For we bound around like a 
rubber ball, 
And we dislocate and set our limbs to music, 
And proclaim to you we lay way over all. 
But we cannot entertain you here much loner, 
For we promised that we'd meet our girls to- night, 
And of course we do not like to disappoint them, 
For you know that wouldn't be exactly right. 
They are models both of neatness and perfection, 
And we kill the darlings dead whene'er we call; 
But when they're promenading with these darkies, 
Why, that's the time we lay over ' em all. 
TheR do not be alarmed, etc. 
ALABAMA

We dance an' crack our jokes— 
De favorites of old and young 
Are de Alabama Mokes.

THE BROADWAY BELVEDERES. 
Written expressly for JOHNSON AND SWAIN, by JAMES F. DooLEY. 
We've just dropped in to dance and sing, 
And please you for awhile, 
And want you to observe us, 
For we put on heaps of style. 
With our nobby clothes and A. T. style 
They say we have no peers, 
And we've lately gained the cognomen 
Of the Broadway Belvederes. 
CHORUS. 
Then open wide your eyes, my friends, 
And watch us while we move, 
(Break) 
And our claim. as dandy darkies, 
To you we'll quickly prove. 
(Break) 
We're always flush, and ne'er pet lush, 
No matter where we go, 
And when we're out, without a 
doubt, 
• 
Our pace is never slow; 
The ladies fair, we do declare, 
Adore these cavaliers, 
For there's none can mash, or cut a 
dash. 
With the Broadway Belvederes. 
But we cannot linger longer. 
For to Washington we go, 
We're engaged to learn the senators 
To shake the heel and toe, 
For the whole of them are crazy. 
And are anxious to appear, 
In graceful songs and dances 
Like the Broadway Belvederes. 
Then open wide, etc.

You've no doubt heard of Alabaster Joe, 
And perhaps, too, of the fascinating figs; 
Although we're not so tall 
we'll take chances with 
them all, 
We're par excellence in song- and-dance and jig. 
Of course you will say that we are vain, 
But you'll find nothing like 118 in the land, 
We're the Orange Blossom Brothers and we never 
had a 
mother, 
But we'll du our best to please you if we can, 
CHouns.

For we're going to raise it great sensation ; 
Oh, yes, we'll make our voices ring,

For we're the boss nigs in all creation. 
Our dress it is different from the rest, 
Our style is our Own, as you can see; 
Though strangers to you all, we thought we'd urn lc 
a 
call, 
And to welcome us we hope you'll all agree. 
It was ' way out in 'Frisco we vere born 
In a 
log lint we used to call our own, 
Our father was .Tosephus, and he said he'd never 
leave us, 
But he's gone away and left us all forlorn. 
Oh, my! listen while we sing, ctC,

Sung with immense success by JoiiNsoti & BRUNO, al. Haverley's 
Minstrels Chicago, 111. 
W E'VE traveled through this happy nation, 
Had to stop at every station, 
White folks always called us out, 
And made us sing and dance; 
Traveled through the canes and bushes, 
Never had no fights or musses, 
Never cooks our victuals for we always eats dem raw, 
We love to hear de banjo ringing. 
Love to hear de darkies singing, 
We're James Girard Gerolmen's children, 
We're just from Arkansaw. 
When we were little-picanninies, 
We eat so much it made us skinny, 
We used to hoe de corn by day, 
And hug the girls by night. 
We were never dandy Diggers, 
Never tried to cut a 
figure, 
If we ;aad to much to say 
They made us held our jaw; 
We used to dance till we were dizzy, 
Just to please our good old Missy; 
We're James Girard Gerolmen's children, 
We're just from Arkansaw.

GOING HOME. 
Words. 
by COG1LL & COOPER. 
Performed by JomisoN & Mum°. 
On I 
good-evening, to you one and all, 
We hope you'll pay attention to our ditty, 
And we'll tell you how we used to do, 
When working on the grand old Mississippi. 
She was the best boat on the line, 
And us nigs were happy then, 
Ur, didn't we have a 
bully time, 
For our crew were colored men. 
Then we used to sing and dance all day, 
And when in port we'd do our work so gayly, 
And happy we'd pass the time away, 
Singing songs we used to sing in old Virginia. 
Oh, we never thought we'd run away, 
For the captain always liked to hear us singing, 
And us figs would feel so light and gay, 
When first we'd hear the good old banjo ringing, 
The passengers would smile on us and always would 
come down, 
To laugh at us happy darkies, 
When we'd do the walk around. 
CHORUS. 
So now, good-bye, we're going home, 
We're going back to good old Virgins, 
Where once we used to hoe the corn so tall, 
And the place wheie we were little picaninnies.

JUST FROM TENNESSEE. 
Original by J
OHNSON & BRUNO. 
White folks we are just from Tennessee, 
We left our homes to have some recreation .„ 
Greatly delighted we will be, 
If we can only gain your approbation. 
We parted from the old folks with a 
sigh, 
And left them a-crying on the station; 
But they'll miss us, 'deed they will, 
And the place will be so still, 
Because the boys have left the old plantation. 
When moonlight streamed across the cabin floor, 
'Twas then the old man sat the banjo ringing; 
The darkies used to gather roun.d the door, 
And MaRsa, too would listen to our singing. 
But often now we sigh for our old home, 
For it is the happiest spot in all the nation; 
But we'll go there before we die, 
And now we're going to try 
To show the style clown oil the id plantation.

AT HOME IN ALABAM. 
Original Song and Dance by JOHNSON & BRUNO. 
Oh! white folks all good-evening, 
We've come to sing to you 
About our home in Alabam, 
Our Massa and Missus too. 
We 
use to work down in de field, 
Dey call us Pete and Sam; 
At evenings how we'd sing and dance 
At home in Alabam. 
CHORUS. 
The good old timis have passed, but still 
We're happy as two clams; 
We'll sing and do a 
step we done, 
At home in Alabam. 
Old Massa he was kind to us, 
But soon he passed away ; 
And silence reigns around the place, 
Where things were once so gay. 
The darkies they have all gone North, 
And scarcely left a 
man 
To play upon the old banjo, 
At home in Alabam. 
The good, etc. 
Oh ! white folks all, we'll say good-bye, 
We're much obliged to you 
For listening to our little song, 
We tried to please you too. 
We're free and honest Diggers now, 
We love old Uncle Sara, 
And the Lord up high will give us all 
A 
home in Alabam. 
The good, etc.

ALL AMONG THE ROSES. 
Poetry and Melody by W. H. DEL=Arm 
IN 
an Ivy-covered cottage, 
Hidden back of oaken trees, 
Lives a 
lovely little maiden, 
Blythe and happy as you please. 
Where upon a 
low veranda, 
Every summer's eventide, 
I 
sit amid the flowers fair 
Camillia by my side. 
CHORUS. 
All among the roses, 
Making swee proposes— 
Lovely, laughing, and bewitching 
. 
Sweet Camillia May; 
Captivating, aggravating, 
Never tired of play— 
F'litting like a 
tittle birdie, 
Happy, light and gay; 
Kill me or I'll die with :ove 
For sweet, Camillia May. 
There's a 
pretty white camella, 
Ever glowing in her hair, 
Lovely violets and roses, 
Blooming in her face so fair. 
Little stars and merry sunshine 
In her eyes so bright and gay, 
And a 
choir of angels singing 
in the voice of Milly May 
All among, eic 
Now forget not to remember, 
When in love you chance to be, 
Try and keep in all your leelings 
Not act foolishly like me ; 
For I 
live on hoping, dreaming, 
Of a 
coming joyous day 
When [' it make of one Camillia 
Such a 
lovely sweet bouquet. 
All among, etc.

Where berries sweetest grow, 
There lives the only girl I

espied her; 
She cried aloud, " Oh, darkie, eon" 
And pull out dis yer briar.

Oh, darkey, don't you linger dere, 
Lord! I 
shall expire, 
Came, help dis bleeding finger, 
And subtract away de briar." (Repeat.)

grabbed this fainting fair one, 
Eight by her little thumb, 
And pulled the thorny dagger out 
Like ' possum from the gum. 
The more I 
kissed the finger, 
De more it seemed to heal, 
And when I 
kissed her two lips, oh, 
flow happy she did feell 
Oh, elarkey,

THE BONELES8 DARKIE. 
Written by BARRY BLACKBURN, and dedicated to JonNsoN & 
Here we are two boneless darkies, 
Happy, merry, funny darkies; 
We'll sing our song and dance, 
And our grace you will admire. 
Now our heel and then our toe, 
Then a 
graceful back-spring throw, 
To beat them all, both great and small, 
In eancing we aspire; 
And when we sing our songs so loud, 
We are always sure to draw a 
crowd, 
For 
try to please them all 
In l/ ir own peculiar way. 
CHORUS. 
Now we'll do our feats of skill, (Sym.) 
And astonish you we surely will, (gym.) 
For we feel so gay and careless, 
Laughing, dancing all the while; 
And laugh you will at our strange antics--
You'll say we are two gum elastics— 
Watch our motions closely, 
And our fascinating style. 
Where'er we go the people wonder, 
And say they think we'll split asunder, 
For our contortion songs-and dances 
Are the gossip of the town. 
And it almost makes the ladies frantic 
When they watch our grotesque antics, 
And say our equals as laugh-makers 
Have not yet been found. 
The folks all laugh and talk about 
And call the funny darkies our, 
,For we take them all by storm 
With our gymnastic fun. 
Now we'll do our feats, etc.

SKELLY, 
I went to de ball wid Angeline, 
She wore a 
dress of gingham green; 
We danc'd till de morning light was seen, 
Way down in flyers Hall. 
Dere was Susie Sims, and George and Pete. 
And all de boys from Wooster Street, 
And Maria Jane, she looked so sweet, 
At de gay old Nigger ball.

0 
golly! what a 
high old time, 
At de gay old Nigger ball! 
We heard all de music gay and sweet, 
It put the shivers in our feet; 
We laughed and we jumped in joy complete, 
Till on de floor we'd fall. 
Dere was " Poppy Horace" wid his " lamb," 
De people wonders who she am; 
She looked just like a 
big smoked ham, 
At de gay old Nigger ball.

De belle of de ball was Angeline, 
And I, of course, was " bellgerine," 
But she was so fat, and I 
so lean, 
We could not dance at all. 
When de morning came, we all was tight, 
And some got sick, and some did tight-
0 my! it was a 
rich old sight, 
At de gay old Nigger ball.

Of the yaller gals so fair;

FORGET—ME—NOT. 
There's a 
modest, star-leafed little flower 
That in beauty decks parterre and bower: 
'Tis the emblem of love—fond mem'ry, too, 
Finds expression meet in its petals blue; 
Let us tell how the humble flow'ret got 
Its sweet, sad-toned name of " Forma- mix-Nom" 
By the side of the Danube's waters blue 
Strayed a 
gallant knight and a 
maiden true: 
She was bright in the light of love divine, 
He was armed for the fields of Palestine; 
And they vowed by the blue-arched dome above 
That for aye should endure their mutual love. 
They repeated their love vows o'er and o'er, 
On the sounding verge of the river's shore, 
And the warrior said: " What parting pledge 
Can I 
give on the swift, blue Danube's edge 
That of me to you may fond mem'ries yield 
When I 
fight afar on the Paynim field ? " 
Then a 
glistening tear dimmed the maiden's eye 
As she said : " No costly gents need I 
To preserve your memory clear and bright 
When you're far away from my longing sight. 
AU I 
ask to cheer each lonely hour 
Is the token sweet of some simple flower." 
49 
FORGET-ME-NOB 
Then she pointed toward the further bank, 
Where bright blue flowers nodded rank on rank. 
At the word in the torrent swift and deep 
The young knight plunged with a 
fearless leap, 
And he struggled on through the roaring tide 
Till he culled the flowers on the other side. 
Then he dashed in the bounding flood again; 
And he fought through the sounding waves amain, 
But his mail was heavy—his strength was gone, 
And the maddened surge bore him wildly on, 
While the maid rent the air with anguished cries 
To behold him perish before her eyes. 
With an effort he cast the flow'rets sweet 
On the green shore-sward at the maiden's feet, 
Then, hid by the clouds of angry spray, 
He was swept from her frenzied sight away, 
And, faint through the torrent's roar, she caught 
In his dying tones: " Forget•me-not !" 
" 
Never more! no, never!" the maiden sobbed, 
While her fair form shook and her ren t 
hear": throb' (1 
"As his partina token these flow'rets fsir; 
I 
will evermore on my bosom wear, 
And, in lordly palace or humble cot, 
Still their name shall be "FORGET-ME-NOT. "

My name is O'Brien from Harlem, 
An Irishman as you can see. 
I 
can sing like a 
thrush or a 
starling, 
Or the little bird up in a 
tree. 
But the gang that stands there on the corner? 
Are trying the steps and the dance, 
And they shout out whenever I'm passing, 
There's O'Brien with his high water pants. 
CHORUS. 
They tell me to go over to England, 
And to pay a 
short visit to France, 
And there to bring out my new fashionS, 
And call them the high water pants. 
Last week I 
went to the theatre, 
Along with my first cousin Dan, 
We hired a 
seat down in the parquette, 
Behind the big man in the band. 
When a 
nager came out with a 
banjo, 
He played up a 
high-land clog dance 
And he gave out a 
gag and conumdrum, 
'Bout O'Brien with his high water pants. 
They tell me, etc. 
One night as I 
strolled down the Bowery, 
Along with a 
friend, Paddy Brock, 
We thot' we'd just drop into Geoghegan's, 
To try some of his rye and rock, 
When the gang all cried there's Dan O'Leary, 
The bar-tender shot me a 
glance, 
"Howld your tongues," then said he to the loafers, 
That's O'Brien with laiA high water pants.

In de evening by de *moonlight, 
When this darkey's work was over, 
We would gather round de fire 
'Till de hoe-cake it was done; 
Then we all would eat our suppers, 
After that we'd clear de kitchen, 
That's de only time we had to spare 
To have a 
little fun. 
Uncle Gabe would take de fiddle down 
That hung upon de wall, 
While de sil ver moon was shining clear and bright; 
How the old folks would enjoy it, 
They would sit all night and listen 
As we sang in de evening by de moonlight. 
CHORUS. 
In de evening by de moonlight 
You could hear us darkies singing, 
In de evening by- de moonlight 
You could hear de banjo ringing. 
How de old folks would enjoy it, 
They would sit all night and listen, 
As we sang in de evening by de moonlight. 
In de evening by de moonlight, 
When de watch-dog would be sleeping; 
In de corner by de fireplace, 
Beside the old arm-chair, 
Where Aunt Chloe used to sit 
And tell de picaninnies stories, 
And de cabin would be filled 
With merry coons, from far and near. 
All dem happy times we used to have 
Will ne'er return again, 
Everything was then so merry, gay and bright, 
And I 
never will forget it 
Just as long as I 
remember, 
How we sang in de evening by de moonlight.

OH, THOSE COWHIDE SLIPPERS! 
Written and sung by TONY PASTOR. 
A 
tale of love I 
now will tell 
Of a 
charming maid I 
loved so well, 
Her name was Blue-eyed, Laughing Nell', 
A 
most bewitching girl. 
'Twas at a 
ball we chanced to meet, 
I 
never met a 
girl so sweet, 
She seemed a 
fairy, dressed so neat, 
My brain was in a 
whirl.-
. 
SPOKEN. — Yes, ' twas at a 
ball I 
first met her, and, • 
as she gracefully waltzed round the room, I 
felt I 
had lost my heart, and as she came sailing past me, 
I 
discovered she had on her little footsey wootsey's— 
CHORUS. 
Oh, such lovely slippers, 
Like to water dippers, 
Red rosettes, high French heels 
And fancy little bows. 
Oh! those darling slippers, 
Oh, those daisy trippers, 
Trimmed with gold, double-soled,. 
And pointed at the toes. 
We met again one rainy day, 
The walks all wet and muddy lay, 
With cautious step she picked her way,. 
And crossed the crowded street. 
'OH, THOSE COWHIDE SLIPPERS! 
(Concluded.) 
I 
watched her proud and lofty stride, 
With two policemen at her side, 
Who helped her reach the other side, 
Policemen on the beat. 
SPOKEN.—Old and young women. (Gag about 
policemen). 
Oh, sueh lovely slippers, etc. 
Again we met as lovers may, 
I 
begged her name the wedding day, 
She blushed and fainted quite away, 
Just then I 
heard a 
roar— 
Her angry father raised his foot, 
He wore a 
number eleven boot, 
,And through the air he let it scoot, 
And bounced me from his door. 
CHoRus. 
Oh! those cowhide slippers, 
Oh! those tan-yard nippers, 
'Crashing! smashing!' through the air, 
Tearing all my clothes— 
,No more golden slippers, 
No more cowhide flippers, 
Copper-lined, iron bound, 
And loaded to the toes.

HARD TIMES, COME AGAIN NO MORE 
Sung by BRYANT'S MinStre1.9. 
Let us pause in hfe's p3easare and count in, many 
tears 
While we au sup sor -ow wii Ii the poor; 
There's a 
song that 'trill linger for ever in our ears— 
" 
Oh! Hard Tice'. e'rne again no more." 
CHORUS. 
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary: 
" 
Hard Times, Hard Times, come again no more; 
Many days you have lingered around my cabin doot, 
Oh, Hard Times, come again no more." 
While we seek mirth and music, and music light and 
gay, 
There are frail forms fainting at the door; 
Though their voices air silent, their pleading looks 
will say— 
" 
Oh, Hard Times, come again no more." 
'Tis the song, etc. 
There's a 
pale, drooping maiden, who toils her life 
away, 
With a 
worn heart whose better days are o'er; 
Though her voice would be merry, ' tis sighing all the 
day— 
" 
Oh, Hard Times, come again no more." 
'Tis the song, etc.

CYR! NICODEMUS. 
Ify,lover he's going to sea, Oh! Nicodemus, 
He's going away awl leaving me, 
To watch the little fishes, swimming in the sea; 
But he'll soon wish for home, and to be back with 
me, 
The ship will heave to, Nicodemus! 
And so wretched you will be, so wretched you wtll be. 
SPOKEN. — So she said— 
CHORUS. 
Nicodemus! Nicodemus! don't you go away? 
I've loved you Nicodemus and I've loved you many a 
day, 
I've loved you in your plain attire, your lovely fustian 
coat, 
Don't leave me Nicodemus, for that boiler-bursting 
boat. 
SPOKEN. — And again she began to sing— 
Salt water, you know, is very wet, Oh, Nicodemus! 
You know you are my only pet, 
And your absence will cause me to fume and fret; 
They will feed you on salt junk and nasty soft-boiled 
peas 
Think of this well, Nicodemus! 
Ere you cross those watery seas, those windy watery 
seas. 
So she said, etc. 
SPOBF.N.—And she also said— 
Of pumpkins boiled you'll get no more, oh Nicodemus! 
Convince yourself of this before, 
Von can't run away there's no back door; 
Reef the anchor, Nicodemus. the Captain he will say 
You'll have to hold on by your eyebrows, 
Or you'll be blown away, straight down to Botany 
Bay; 
So she said, etc.

Though sad is their refrain; 
They seem to love and know us 
While strolling down the lane.
