G. W. MURRAY'S VERSION OF " LOVE, BEAU-
TIFUL LOVE." 
Love, love, oh! what is love 7 
Love, ' tis that makes man feel so pe-cu-li-ar; 
Oh, love, who does not love a 
Maud, Matilda, Jane or a 
Julia; 
Love it is and love alone that makes the world go round and 
round; 
Love, ' tis love, ids sure to be known where a 
woman's to be 
found, 
When we have the first attack, ' tis like raspberry jam running 
down one's back. 
CHORUS. 
Love, love, oh! what is love ? 
Love, ' tis that makes man feel so pe-cu-li-ar; 
Love, love, who does not love a 
Maud, Matilda, Jane or a 
Julia ? 
Oh, Love, when you are in love, 
To presents and parties and pic-nics you treat her; 
Oh, love, you just squeeze her glove, and feel just as though 
you could eat her; 
But the best of love must part, then an end comes to your bliss, 
You press the dear one to your heart, then from her take the 
parting kiss ! 
You bid her good-bye at the door with another kiss, and two or 
three more. 
Love, love, etc. 
Oh ; love, when you are in love, 
Every half hour you'd go to court her; 
Oh, love, if she won't love you, talk of drowning yourself in 
cold water; 
If it is all right, she'll giggle and say, please ask father if I 
may; 
Then you feel so jolly and gay, and tease her till she names the 
day; 
You serenade her when she is a-bed and her father drops 
flower pots on your head. 
Love, love, etc.

THE MULLIGAN GUARD. 
By kind permission of HARRIGAN and H ART. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1873, by N ED HAttnioAN, 
in the Office of the Librarian of t 
ongress, at Washington, D. C. 
Composed and sung by H ARRIG AN and Harr, with immense success, at the 
Theatre t_omique, New York. 
.W E 
crave your condescension, 
And we'll tell you what we know 
Of marching in the Mulligan Guards 
From the seventh ward below; 
And our Captain's name was Hussey— 
A Tipperary man— 
He carried his sword like the Russian Duke, 
Whenever he took command. 
CHORUS . 
We shouldered guns, 
And marched, and marched away 
From Jackson Street 
Way up to Avenue A. 
Drums and fifes did sweetly, sweetly play, 
As we marched, marched, marched in the Mulligan Guards. 
When the band play'd Garryowen or the Connemarro pet, 
With the rub, dub, dub, we marched in the mud— 
To the military step— 
With the green above the red, boys, 
To show where we came from ; 
Our guns we'd lift, 
With the right shoulder shift, 
As we marched to the beat of the drum. 
We shouldered, etc. 
When we'd get home at night, boys, 
The divil a 
wink we'd sleep ; 
We'd all set up and drink a 
sup 
Of whiskey, strong and neat. 
Then we'd all march home together 
As slippery as lard; 
The solid men would all fall in, 
And march in the Mulligan Guard. 
We shouldered, etc.

JOHNNIE'S 
JUBILEE. 
Sung by JOHN Monaissrit. 
On, I 
have travelled in the East, 
And also in the West, 
And L 
have travelled in the South 
The place I 
love best, 
For it's there you get your hoe cake done, 
Baked red hot in the pan ; 
It's there you get your yallar gals, 
The white, the black and tan. 
For there's where we were born, 
It is the place so dear ; 
We'll sing and dance from night till morn, 
Till daylight does appear. 
There in the South we had good times, 
A hoeing of the corn, 
A 
picking cotton all day long, 
As sure as you are born; 
But now these times done past are gone, 
But I 
hope they'll come back soon, 
And then we'll go a-hunting 
For the possum and the coon. 
For there's where, etc. 
ENCORE VERSE. 
Oh now white folks, you have called me back, 
But I've nothing else to sing, 
Except I 
thank you for applause 
Which made the house just ring; 
But if you come some other night, 
I'll try and do my best, 
So now I 
shake my No. nines, 
And then T 
go and rest. 
For there's where. etc.

I'M SAILING AT THE DAWN, DARLING. 
I'M sailing at the dawn, darling, 
Away from all I 
love, 
It may be on old Erin's sod, 
My feet no more shall rove; 
But as I 
leave my home, darling, 
The tears will sadly fall, 
To think of you, so kind and true, 
I 
love you best of all. (
Repeat.) 
Your smile is brave and good, darling, 
It cheers me to the last, 
But oh, the weary clouds of care, 
That o'er my way are east; 
I'll think upon you all, darling, 
My babes so bright and fair, 
My little home, and you, my own, 
That made sweet sunshine there. (Repeat.) 
For you were ever kind, darling, 
In poverty and pain, 
Oh, press the gentle lips to mine, 
I 
ne'er may press again; 
In lands beyond the sea, darling, 
I'll toil for you, my own, 
Trust Heav'n we'll meet again, sweet, 
When days are brighter grown. (
Repeat.) 
I'm Railing at the dawn, darling, 
But hope is in my breast. 
Farewell, dear angel of my heart, 
And land I 
love the best; 
I 
know you'll think of me, darling, 
Each weary night and day. 
May Heav'n's blessings on you fall, 
When I 
am far away. (

scot and lot, 
For 
that was old Pe - ter's 
way. 
Though Peter was handsome, he never would wed, 
Yet the ladies he loved passing well; 
And the reason he gave was of all the dear sex, 
Which he loved best he never could tell. 
The Pollys, the Sallys, the Annies, the Fans, 
So smothered poor Peter's soft heart; 
A 
bachelor free he resolved to be, 
And never in wedlock take part. 
And he smoked his pipe and sang old songs, 
And merrily soaked his clay, 
And cheerfully paid his scot and lot, 
For that was old Peter's way. 
Old Peter jogged on in his usual way, 
And his pipe smoked with Reid's double stouc; 
Till, driving one day, in his turn-out so gay, 
A 
sweet damsel upon him did pout. 
Her bonnie black eyes took him by surprise, 
He asked her if she'd be his wife; 
She smiling said, yes, and he gave her a 
kiss, 
And now they are settled for life. 
Still he smokes his pipe and sings old songs, 
And merrily soaks his clay; 
His children and wife loves more than life, 
For that is old Peter's way.

THE SWEETEST BUD IS MISSLINTCL 
YES, the sweetest bud is missing 
From our beautiful bouquet, 
We her cunning lips were kissing, 
When our darling fled away; 
Far above, where all is glory, 
They have borne our angel fair, 
And we'll hear no more her story 
'Bout the golden pastures there.

Yes, the sweetest bud is missing 
From our beautiful bouquet; 
We her cunning lips were kissing, 
When our darling fled away. 
How the darling once so merry 
Used to climb upon our knee, 
For her pretty cheeks so cherry, 
Sought a 
loving kiss from me; 
Oft upon my back a-riding, 
We would skip from place to place, 
And when at a 
game of hiding, 
She the corner sure would trace. 
Yes, the sweetest bud, etc. 
Oh, sweet rosebud, could we bring you 
To our circle once again, 
All together we would greet you 
From our weary hearts of pain; 
But above, where all are praising 
him, who bade my love arise— 
Your sweet voice I 
know is raising, 
With the others in the skies. 
Yes, the sweetest bud, etc.

IF THOU WERT BY MY SIDE. 
Oil, I'll rove to the wild-wood glen, 
From home afar—afar, 
And beauty sway my spirit then, 
While I 
tune my lone guitar. 
My soul may drink of Nature's charms, 
Fondly and free—and free, 
Where care nor fear my heart alarms, 
There, love, I'll sineof thee. 
Where care nor fear my heart alarms, 
There, love, I'll sing of thee. 
On zephyrs sweet that passeth by, 
Will waft for me—for me, 
Many a 
note and gentle sigh, 
My own dear one, for thee. 
And with my song the wild-wood bird 
May chime so sweet—so sweet, 
Afar, perchance, it may be heard, 
And thine own ear will greet. 
Afar, perchance, it may be heard, 
And thine own ear will greet. 
Where bright flowers do ever bloom, 
So rare, and gay—and gay, 
It would be joy were it my doom 
To be with them while life away; 
But for one thought my heart would rest, 
It cannot hide—not hide, 
For with sweet bliss I 
would be blel, 
If thou wert by my side. 
For with sweet bliss I 
would be bles', 
If thou wert by my side.

.SEE the flowers, their heads are drooping, 
The golden sun is near the West, 
Leave me not with heart desponding, 
Thou my dearest, loveliest, best; 
Stay with me when all the woods are still, 
Love can shield you yet from ev'ry ill ; 
Stay with me when all the woods are still, 
Love can shield you yet from ey'ry ill. 
I 
have loved thee well and fondly,

Stay with me, when all the woods are are still, 
Love can shield you yet from ev'ry ill, 
Stay with me when all the woods are still, 
Love can shield you yet from ev'ry ill. 
Trust not yonder world of sorrow, 
heartless is that world and cold ; 
The garb of truth may borrow, 
All that glistens is not gold;

HAPPY LITTLE VIOLETS.

Fourth St., Cincinnati, owners of the copyright. 
MoRN is shining in the skies, 
Still fresh with dew our forms arise, 
We come as violets you to cheer, 
So please accept our presence here ; 
Observe our smiling, hours beguiling, 
Happy little violets, blooming in the sun, 
Colors bright, day and night, 
Till our life is done. 
By the way-side oft we grow, 
Yet still our happy smile we show, 
In gardens rich oft-times we're found, 
And sometimes crushed upon the ground; 
Yet still we're smiling, hours beguiling, 
Happy little violets blooming in the sun, 
Colors bright, day and night, 
Till our life is done. 
Take a 
lesson then from us, 
Where e'er you're placed in fortune trust, 
Little violets offer this, 
Please accept it with a 
kiss; 
Always smiling, hours beguiling, 
happy little violets blooming in the sun, 
Colors bright, day and nit, 
Till our work is done.

GOING TO THE SHUCKING. 
Banjo Duet, sung by M ULLIGAN and W ILD. 
W HAT'S the matter, Pompey, what's the matter now 1 
The roosters are a-crowing, and so am the brindle cow ; 
The pigs they am a 
squealing, the old tom cat does meow, 
Miss Susie she am going to feed the speckled sow. 
CHORUS. 
Then we're going to the shucking, 
Yes, we'll go to the shucking, 
Yes, we'll go to the shucking of the corn, of the corn, 
And we'll stay until the morning, 
Yes, we'll stay until the morning, 
We'll stay until the morning, sure as you are born. 
Her dad be was a 
surgeon, they called him Dandy Jim; 
lie cut down all the trees to amputate the limb, 
Her mother took in washing, they called her Aunty Simms, 
She'd fourteen little children, and she used them for clothes-
pins. 
Then we're going, etc. 
Her head was like a 
cabbage, and reddish was her cheek, 
Her nose it was a 
turnip, and therefore can't be beat; 
Her legs they were like cornstalks, her heels they followed arter, 
She come upon her toes, which make her a 
totnater. 
Then we're going, etc. 
Miss Lucy said she loved me, she says she loved me too: 
To me she'd give her gizzard, to me I 
know she's true; 
She am a 
rhinocerus, she's a 
hump-backed Chamomile, 
She's a 
giraffe-hippopotamus, she's a 
kangaroo- crocodile.

Steers on through storm and wave.

I'VE BEEN THTIRE BEFORE. 
Sung by JOE LANG. 
I'm. tell you of a 
nice young girl, 
The sweetest ever was seen, 
I 
met her at a 
fancy ball, 
She picked me up for green; 
She asked me if l'd see her home, 
About the hour of four, 
I 
answered yes, of course I 
would, 
For I'd been there before. 
CHORUS. 
You all know how it is yourself, 
Shoo fly, now buzz no more, 
Go away gals, don't bodder with me, 
I 
tell you I've been there before. 
The other day now I 
dropped in 
A 
saloon on Chatham street, 
A 
fancy chap was standing near, 
Said Bill, my pard, come treat ; 
I 
paid the drinks and started out, 
He shouted, say, old boy, 
Lend me ten, I 
shook my head, 
For I'd been there before. 
CHORUS. 
Just so, colonel, I'm red hot, 
Go home and soak your head ; 
Kiss me for my darling mother, 
And put me in my little bed. 
One night when I 
was out quite late, 
I 
met a 
gay young sport, 
And to a 
faro bank we went, 
lie whispered he was short, 
I 
gave him five, he lost it quick, 
And then asked me for more; 
I 
told him no, don't try that on, 
For I'd been there before. 
Now, if it's all the same to you, 
My dear boys, upon my honor, 
We've built a 
little church for all, 
And it f:tand7 ,hrt areund the co-ner. 
CILARLIE'S CURLY HAIR. 
Original. 
Sung by Miss IONE LANG. 
I 
KNOW a 
fellow nice and sweet, 
A 
beautiful brunette, 
He is not swellish, but he's just 
A 
darling, you can bet. 
His form is beautiful and straight, 
He has a 
manly air, 
And then he has a 
lovely head 
Of black and curly hair. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, he is just a 
darlinc, duck, 
My Charlie sweet and fair; 
And nothing seems so dear to we 
As Charlie's curly hair. 
He has a 
dark and piercing eye, 
A 
killing black moustache, 
And when he promenades the street 
lie cuts a 
nobby dash—you bet; 
The girls they all are after him, 
For them he does not care, 
Althouah they often compliment 
His black and curly hair. 
Oh, he is, etc. 
Together we go out to ride, 
Behind a 
trotter fast, 
You ought to see us on the road, 
We never are the last—you bet ; 
We shoot by all the single team., 
Oft beat a 
fancy pair, 
And all the time I'm thinking of 
My Charlie's curly hair. 
Oh, he is, etc. 
He calls to see me twice a 
week, 
And brings nice things to eat, 
Which he takes from the pocke,s of 
His clothes made up so neat—you bet; 
And ere he bids me " sweet good- night, 
lie whispers of an heir, 
That we may have in future years, 
With block and cu-lv hair.

OH ! GEORGE ! 
Sung by W ALTER LABURNUM. 
SOME time ago I 
knew a 
girl, 
Who'd eyes of sparkling brightness, 
With coral lips and teeth of pearl, 
And steps of fairy lightness: 
Then when I 
used to whisper love, 
As we along did stray, 
She'd, smiling, hang her bead and blush, 
And timidly would say— 
CHORUS . 
Oh! George! Oh! George! 
You know I'm so sensitive, George: 
It isn't display—but only my way, 
Whenever I 
say, Oh! George! 
Her manners were so innocent, 
So charming and so chaste, 
That, as we walked, I 
gently stole 
My arm around her waist; 
She shrank in modest fear away, 
As her along I 
led, 
And blushing like the opening day, 
Most timidly she said— 
Oh! George, etc. 
As time flew on, our love grew strong, 
And, one day, I 
proposed ; 
I 
said that I 
should like to wed— 
If she was so disposed. 
She gave a 
sigh and shed a 
tear, 
Then hung her little bead, 
And in her usual simple way 
To me again she said— 
Oh! George, etc.) 
And Low in happy unity 
A merry life we lead, 
With lots of olive brances, 
Which I 
have to clothe and feed; 
And sometimes when we speak about 
Ohl times all passed away, 
She'll bring to mind those courting nours, 
When slyly she did sav— 
Oh ! George, otc 
OLD AUNT JEMINIA. 
Originally sung by JOE LANG. 
I 
WENT to church the other day, 
Old Aunt Jemima, Oh! Oh! Oh! 
To hear them white folks sing and pray, 
Old Aunt Jemima, Oh! Oh! Oh! 
They prayed so long I 
couldn't stay, 
Old Aunt Jemima, Oh! Oh! Oh! 
I 
knew the Lord would come that way, 
Old Aunt Jemima, ! Oh! Oh 
CHORUS . 
Oh ! Carline, Oh ! Carline, 
Can't you dance the bee line, 
Old Aunt Jemima, Oh! Oh ! Oh! 
The monkey dressed in soldier's clothes, 
Old Aunt Jemirna, Oh! Oh! Oh! 
Went out in the woods for to drill some crows, 
Old Aunt Jemima, Oh! Oh! Oh! 
The jay bird bung on the swinging limb, 
Old Aunt Jernima,011! Oh! 011! 
I 
up with a 
stone and hit him on the shin, 
Old Aunt Jemima, Oh! Oh! Oh! 
Oh! Carline, etc. 
The bullfrog married the tadpole's sister, 
OM Aunt Jemima, Oh! Oh ! Olt! 
He smacked his lips and then he kissed her, 
OM Aunt Jemima, Oh! Oh! Oh! 
She says if you love Inc as I

PULLMAN CAR. 
Words by ALFRED HUDSON. Music by CHAS. J. 
MIER& 
PRAY give me your attention, 
Some facts to you I'll mention 
About a 
dear, bewitching girl 
I 
met the other day ; 
'Twas in the hours of leisure, 
While travelling just for pleasure, 
She came walking through a 
Pullman Car, 
And looked so sweet and gay— 
CHORUS. 
Riding in a 
Pullman Car. 
Whilst riding in a 
Pullman Car, 
A 
girl she passed me by, 
And winked at me so sly, 
Whilst riding in a 
Pullman Car. 
Riding in, etc. 
As I 
alone was sitting, 
She through the car came flitting; 
I 
watched her with enraptured gaze, 
As she was tripping by, 
My heart was gone completely, 
Her eyes they beamed so sweetly— 
I 
smiled at her, she smiled at me, 
And then she winked her eye. 
Riding in, etc. 
At last we reached the station, 
Which was our destination ; 
I 
lost sight of the pretty girl, 
Who stole my heart away; 
But soon I 
mean to find her, 
And then I 
will remind her, 
About that small flirtation 
We had the other day. 
Riding in, etc.

WASHINGTON, THE STAR OF THE WEST. 
There's a 
Star in the West that will never go down, 
Till the records of valor decay; 
We must worship its light, for, it is our own, 
And liberty bursts in its ray. 
Shall the name of Washington ever be heard 
By a 
freeman, and thrill not his breast? 
Is there one out of bondage that bails not the name 
Of Washington, Star of the West ? 
War! war to the knife—be enthralled or ye die! 
Was the echo that waked up the land; 
But it was not this frenzy that promoted the cry, 
Nor rashness that kindled the brand— 
Ile threw back the fetters, he headed the strife, 
Till man's charter was firmly restored; 
Then he prayed for the moment when liberty and life 
Would no longer be pressed by the sword. 
Oh ! his laurels were pure, and his patriotic name 
In the pages of the future shall dwell, 
And be seen in all annals, the foremost in fame, 
By the side of a 
Hoffer and Tell! 
Then cherish his meary, the brave and the good, 
At Mount Vernon the hero now rests: 
Peace, peace to his ashes— our father is dead! 
Great Washington, Star of the West!

BY-GONE DAYS. 
Words by M ARTIN CAWOOD.—MUSiC by W. IL W EISS. 
I THINK of thee and those bright hours,

And love and hope were all our own. 
I

I 
live again a 
life of bliss, 
Nor wish a

And love and hope were all our own, 
Love and hope were all our own, 
Love and hope were all our own. 
I 
think of thee, and in my mind 
A 
heav'n of purest bliss I 
find; 
And, oh! as long as thou art there. 
how can I 
languish and despair ? 
As long as ling'ring hope remains, 
As long as life one thought retains, 
That cherished thought shall ever be 
Of by- gone days, of love and thee. 
I 
think of thee, etc. 
TTIF, 
VILLAGE CLOCK. 
THE village clock is striking eight 
As the misty twilight closes, 
And some one stands in the cottage porch, 
Under the clustering roses ; 
And ever she gazes down the read, 
Her young heart anxiously beating; 
" 
Why stays he so late," thinks she, 
Her lips each stroke of the clock repeating ; 
" 
Why stays he so late," thinks she, 
Her lips each stroke of the clock repeating. 
The villaac clock is striking ten 
While two ' neath the roses linger, 
And something bright in the fair moonlight:, 
S'dnes on the maiden's finger ; 
And whispers the youth " to-morrow morn," 
As he bids good-bye in the door- way. 
Oh! hasten thy coming, happy dawn, 
There shall some one be waking before ye, 
Oh ! hasten thy cominv, happy dawn, 
There shall some one be waliing before ye.

THE YOUNG CHAP DRESSED IN BLUE. 
I'LL tell you a 
tale about Dorothy Vale, 
A 
cook in Grosvenor Square, 
Who fell in love with a 
fine young man, 
Who'd about his face much hair. 
His eyes they were of a 
gooseberry tint, 
'Tis as well to tell to you, 
With a 
slight proclivity to a 
squint, 
And he wore a 
suit of blue. 
CUORUS. 
He was a 
fine man, fol de diddle T 
do, 
lie was a 
fine man, tol do riddy eh ! 
He was a 
fine man, fol de diddle I 
do. 
He was a 
fine man, fol de diddle day. 
On his collar there was a 
number plac'd, 
On his arm there was a 
band, 
And as he walk'd with a 
stately step, 
No one looked half so grand. 
The little boys with their kites and hoops, 
From him like wild fire flew, 
While cookey would hand up the mutton chops 
To this young chap dress'd in blue. 
He was a 
fine man, etc. 
The magistrate committed him, 
The cookey lost her place, 
But the cabby shortly married her, 
To kiver her disgrace ; 
The poor policemen got six years' 
Penal servitude to do; 
So that's all I 
know of the cabby, the cook, 
And the young chap dress'd in blue, 
Who was a 
fine man etc. 
IN A JUG. 
ANSWER TO LITTLE BROWN JUG. 
INly wife and I 
lived all alone, 
In a 
brown stone house we call'd our own; 
She had money and I 
had none, 
And that is why we were joined in one. 
CHORUS. 
Ha! ha ! ha! just bear and grin, 
1Vhen you have found you're taken in, 
ha! ha! ha! just bear and grin, 
When you have found you're taken in.' 
I 
thought I 
made a 
point so fine, 
That mine was hers and hers was mine, 
With golden hooks we fish'd for fate, 
And both caught gudgeons with our bait. 
Ha! ha! ha! etc. 
For she supposed that I 
was rich, 
While I 
was on the self-same " hitch," 
The cruel vixen had me pinned 
To one lame leg, and a 
bag of—wind. 
Ha! ha! ha! etc. 
Su if you find that you are bit, 
Just trace it to a 
Woman's wit; 
They'll make you find a 
little later, 
You've too much " o' the precious crature." 
ha! ha! ha! etc. 
To drown your misery and your plight, 
" 
Little Brown Jug" may make you tight,', 
But I'll be bound though you may tug, 
They'll get you " tighter " in a 
jug. 
Ha! ha! ha! etc. 
Now all young men just look ahead, 
Be very careful who you wed, 
The women laugh to think you're " sold," 
While " all that glitters is not gold." 
Ha ! ha ! ha ! etc.

SQUINT-EYED MOLLY GEE.

I

To theatres and concert halls

The stage seemed Paradise to me; 
The brightest actress on the stago 
Was cruel squint-eyed Molly Gee. 
cumtus. 
Molly G2e, oh ! Molly Gee! 
I 
cannot help but think of thee— 
I 
fancied that thou did'st love me, 
Thou cruel squint-eyed Molly Gee ! 
The stage has from me faded now, 
And ten unhappy years have flown, 
Since Molly Gee did from me go 
With some chap who's to me unknown. 
I 
don't want her to see again, 
I 
know she don't want me to see, 
My prayers shall not for her arise, 
That cruel squint-eyed Molly Gee.

SLEEP WELL, 
THOU SWEET ANGEL ! 
Music by FRANZ ART. 
The Music of this piece, arranged for the voice and pianoforte, is published 
by E. H . 
H ARDING, in his elegant and large double sheet 
form, at No. 288 Bowery—Price Ten Cents. 
THE bells are hushed, the world is still, 
The sounds of toil are heard no more: 
The bird has ceased his tuneful song, 
And heav'n with stars is spangled o'er. 
Sleep well, sleep well, and let thy lovely eye-lids close, 
Sleep well, sleep well, dear angel, sweet be thy repose ! 
Oh ! did'st thou think of inc to-day 7 
The thouoht of thee my heart could fill, 
And now to breathe a 
fond good night. 
Beside thy door I 
linger still. 
Sleep well, sleap well, etc. 
There comes to thee from heav'nlv realms 
A 
holy messenger to-night,

Till you wake in morning's light. 
Sleep well, sleep well etc.

IT'S EASY, 
IF YOU ONLY KNOW THE WAY. 
I'VE heard some people say, if you only know the way, 
Success is very easy to obtain, 
Of that I've not a 
doubt, the way you first find out, 
And then success you certainly may gain; 
Some men, as you're aware, build castles in the air, 
But very soon they vanish and decay, 
Whilst others on firm ground build castles firm and sound, 
It's easy, if you only know the way. 
CHORUS. 
My advice now don't forget, and never run in debt, 
One hundred cents in the dollar always pay, 
Then fortune's sure to smile, and you may live in style, 
It's easy, if you only know the way. 
Some men of honest mind, examples to mankind, 
Who never do a 
fellow creature wrong; 
Because they're not unjust, get lower in the dust, 
And vainly struggle in life's busy throng. 
Some men you may remark, like working in the dark, 
And others in the honest light of day, 
But be it dark or light, some gain ambition's height., 
It's easy, if you only know the way. 
My advice now, etc. 
Some bankrupts, when in debt, soon out of trouble stet ; 
And companies there are too by the score, 
Whose base directors will their gaping pockets fill 
With savings of the honest, needy poor; 
Then fortune-hunters bold, although they're sometimes. sold, 
A winning card will very often play, 
And wed some foolish dame, with money and a 
name, 
It's easy if you only know the way. 
My advice now, etc. 
Let each one do his best, and luck will do the rest 
As on life's stormy ocean we are tossed, 
Don't borrow from a 
friend, and don't too freely lend, 
For through it, friends are very often lost; 
Then try with all your might, to do what's just and right, 
And don't let vulgar tastes your judgment sway, 
But work with right good will to climb Dame Fortune's hilt, 
It's easy, if you only know the way. 
My advice, etc.

Seeking a

Many a 
thought of loved ones bring, 
Hovering around your tiny nest, 
Calling your loved ones home to rest. 
Oh ! happy bird, no thought of care, 
No aching heart, no grief to bear, 
Over rue land, over the sea, 
Come change your home and live with me. 
Come change your home, 
No more to roam, 
Come change your home. 
Come, birdie, etc. 
Birdies, what makes you fly away, 
When I

I'll not deceive you, you are free, 
If you should come and live with me. 
Now, birdie, fly, fast to the sky, 
To your sweet home, for, night is nigh, 
And when the sun shines o'er the lea, 
Bring thy sweet mate and live with me. 
Then we will sing, 
Daylight to bring, 
Then we will sing.

SOLDIER TALK. 
ONE very funny habit, since our cruel war is done, 
And as•welcome as the devil, to each and every one. 
Whatever now may happen, even in our daily walk, 
We find our soldier people full of military talk. 
CHOP.US. 
Soldier talk, soldier talk, it now is all the rage, 
In every conversation, on every written page; 
And it is the truth, both young and old, you may go near or far, 
The people all have soldier talk, contracted in the war. 
Miss Dinah Snow is married to a 
dashing soldier fine, 
She says, in hanging out the clothes, she's going to " dress the 
line," 
And when she goes to fix her hair, with military tunes, 
She combs her wool in " regiments," then turns it in " platoons." 
Soldier talk, etc. 
If you go to set a 
table, you must set the plates in " rank," 
The spoons in front as " skirmishers," the knives and forks 
upon the " flank ;" 
You call the ham the " colors," for the men to " rally round," 
And you tell the folks to " fall in," and bravely " hold their 
ground." 
Soldier talk, etc. 
The women, too, how quickly new habits now contract, 
You'll see them every day wearing " cascades " on their back, 
And when they go to cross a 
gutter (you'll think I'm rude, I 
fear), 
Especially if it's muddy, why, it's " close up in the rear." 
Soldier talk, etc. 
But as this life is ended, fast as I 
close the rhyme, 
The doctors at the " surgeon's call," the lawyers " marking 
time," 
And there's the " chaplain," with the " troops," he'll tell you 
what to do 
To miss old Nick's " roll- call" and shirk the last " tattoo." 
Soldier talk, etc.

FROM T -Frr, VALLEY YOU'RE GOING. 
Words by FBAnic W . 
GREEN—M USIC 
by ANTHONY Num 
FROM the valley they tell me you're going, 
I 
shall miss your blue eyes and sweet smile, 
For, alas! you take with you the sunshine 
That has brightened my pathway awhile; 
'Tis a 
long time, you know, I 
have waited 
For the word that you never would say, 
But now ev'ry fond hope has vanished, 
For they tell me you're going away. 
CHORUS. 
From the valley they tell me you're going, 
I 
shall miss your blue eyes and sweet smile: 
For, alas! you take with you the sunshine 
That has brightened my pathway awhile, 
That has brightened my pathway awhile. 
Do you think of the valley you're leaving, 
And how lonely and drear it will be? 
Do you think of the heart you are breaking, 
And the sadness that's shadowing me? 
Then consider again, ere you leave us, 
Do not haste so to bid us adieu— 
But think of the bright little valley, 
And the boy who has ever been true. 
From the valley, etc. 
I REMEMBER well the time, tho' twas many years ago, 
When I 
woed and won the love of dear Annie; 
Oh ! the time went swiftly by like a 
sweet gliding stream, 
For my young heart was happy, light and free. 
But that happy time is past and my hair is turning gray— 
For that loved one I 
never more shall see. 
And my heart is sad and lone as I 
weep from day to day, 
Since dear Annie is no longer here with me. 
Oh ! Annie, dear Annie, thou art laid 
Where the tall willows wave, 
And my heart is sad and lonely, 
Yes, my heart is sad and lonely, 
As I 
weep o'er dear Annie's grave. 
Twas a 
bright and sunny morning in the Autumn of the yea r, 
When they told me that I'd lost dear Annie; 
'That her sweet and gentle voice I 
never more shall hear, 
Or her winning smile would beam again on me— 
In a 
little green vale where the sweet flowers bloom, 
Near the spot where the tall willows wave, 
They have laid her there to rest, and my heart is sad and lone, 
As I 
weep o'er dear Annie's grave. 
Oh! Annie, dear Annie, etc.

IT'S HARD TO LOVE. 
As sung by CHARLES Bactcus, of the San Francisco Minstrels. 
I 
LOVED a 
girl not long ago, 
her father drove a 
cart, 
But she's gone and left me all alone, 
And broken my poor heart. 
CHORUS. 
It's hard to love, hard to love, 
hard to change my mind, 
She's broken the heart of many another nig, 
And she's almost broken mine. 
I 
know I'll die, I'm sure I 
will, 
I 
feel it in my heart, 
And if she don't marry me, 
I 
will steal her father's mule and cart. 
It's hard to love, etc. 
Her front name was Susan Jane, 
She had a 
foot like a 
giraffe, 
And every time she went to walk, 
She made the darkeys laugh. 
It's hard to love, etc. 
If ever I 
do marry again, 
It won't be for love or riches, 
I'll marry a 
gal ' bout ten-foot- ten, 
So she can wear my—overcoat. 
LAST CHORUS. 
It's hard to love, hard to love, 
To me she was most dear, 
Fill up and bust, get up and dust, 
And walk off on your ear.

THE NUMBER NINE. 
ON 
great Broadway the other day, 
Whilst riding in the cars, 
I. espied a 
little yaller gal, 
With eyes as bright as stars; 
A 
conversation sweet began, 
What horror then was mine, 
On looking for her little foot, 
It was a 
number nine. 
CHORUS. 
It was a 
number nine, I 
know, 
My memory ain't so kind, 
As ever to forget ' till death, 
That awful number nine. 
Of course I 
saw her to her home, 
She asked me in, I 
went; 
But wish those hours somewhere else, 
E'en down below were spent. 
For she sat there, and I 
sat here, 
And over there did shine. 
Hey, what! indeed ? it was the toe 
Of that great number nine. 
It was, etc. 
At last I 
turned to leave the house, 
But on the floor I 
fell, 
While to my ears there came a 
squeal, 
I 
knew it but too well; 
I'd stumbled—o'er her foot did fall, 
What agony was mine, 
Next moment I 
through the window flew, 
At the end of that number nine. 
It was, etc. 
I'm looking for her every day, 
To reach me close in chase, 
But then I'll know she's coming e'en 
Before I 
see her face. 
And if I 
do, I'll fix her too, 
Revenge sweet will be mine, 
Before she's within half a 
mile, 
I'll fix that number nine. 
It was, etc.

YOU SNOW HOW IT IS. 
An.—" Swinging in the Lane." 
SINCE by-words they are all the rage, 
As through the world we fly, 
The last one brought out on the stage, 
Was—" Haw is that for high ;" 
To get a 
new one up I've tried, 
Though I 
don't mean to quiz, 
You'll hear it.told by young and old, 
Tt's—You know how it is. 
CHORUS. 
You'll hear it sung by- every tongue, 
By Harry, Jane or Liz; 
You'll hear it told by young and old, 
It's—You know how it it. 
A 
young man knows a 
pretty girl, 
And loves her dear as life, 
And after courting for six months, 
Asks her to be his wife; 
He tells he her has lots of cash, 
And also a 
good biz; 
Be mine, he cries, she gently sighs, 
George—You know how it is. 
You'll hear it, etc. 
A 
drunkard's brought before a 
judge, 
'Bout once or twice a 
week, 
His " honor" always lets him off, 
Because he's lots of cheek; 
He says, " Young man, where do you get 
The money to buy fizz ?" 
" 
My father's cashier in a 
bank 
And, Judge—you know how it is." 
You'll hear, etc.

THAT'S WHERE WE BOTH GRAB GROUND. 
By NED HARRIGAN, for 1VALTEns and MORTON. 
W E'RE a 
loose and careless pair of nigs, 
We're honey from the comb, 
We twist our legs in reel or jig, 
And dislocate the bone. 
Our understandings are immense, 
Just listen to the sound, 
We've got a 
heap of common sense, 
That's where we both grab ground. 
CHORUS. 
So watch this curlicue, (S'ymph.) 
Oh, ain't it fun for you, (
Symph.) 
For with a 
bound we bounce around, 
That's where we both grab ground. 
The peculiar vibrations 
That's just below the knee, 
Causes a 
sensation 
Which creates a-jility, 
It raises dust and makes a 
noise, 
And lays thinY,s loose around, 
here's what knocks—electric shocks, 
That's where we both grab ground. 
So watch this, etc. 
To our lady friends we did intend 
To say a 
word or two, 
If nothing more than au-revoir, 
Or girls, how do you do ? 
But we know they will excuse us, 
And won't give us a 
frown ; 
For among the dears we have no fearl 
Of losing any ground. 
So watch this, etc.

OLD BLACK JOE. 
Sung by BLYANT'S Minstrels. 
GONE are the days when my heart was young and gay,. 
Gone are my friends from the cotton fields away, 
Gone from the earth to a 
better land, I 
know: 
I 
hear their gentle voices calling: " Old Black Joe." 
CHORUS. 
I'm coming, I'm corning, for my head is bending low, 
I 
hear their gentle voices calling : " Old Black Joe. 
Why do I 
weep when my heart should feel no pain ? 
Why do I 
sigh that my friends come not again ? 
Grieving for forms departed long ago— 
I 
hear their gentle voices calling : " Old Black Joe." 
Pm coming, etc. 
Where are the children I 
held npon my knee? 
Where are the hearts once so happy and so free ? 
Gone to the shore where my soul has longed to go— 
I 
herr their gentle voices calling: " Old Black Joe."

TOM AND JERRY, 
THE TWINS. 
On, here we are, a 
couple of gay colored darks, 
That are out on a 
sort of a 
spree, 
We ain't very particular about the cut of our rig, 
As you can undoubtedly see. 
But we'll hoop you up a 
dish 
Of the loveliest style of two rnokes with cream colored skins, 
For two gayer darkeys you never will find, 
Than Gay Tom and Jerry, the twins. 
CHODITS. 
For so happy we feel, (
Symph ) 
From head to heel, (Symph.) 
For two gayer darkeys you never will find, 
Than gay Tom and Jerry, the twins. 
But now we've resolved to settle in life, 
That's if two charmers we can find, 
Two darling little wives, that will just suit our taste, 
But they must be both loving and kind; 
So girls open your eyes and go in for a 
chance, 
For it's talent„ not beauty, that wins ; 
And never say no, when you're once asked to dance 
With gay Tom and Jerry the twins. 
For so happy, etc, 
INDIA RUBBER YALLRR GAL. 
W EILE walking down the street one day, 
All in the wind and rain, 
I 
saw a 
pretty yaller gal 
A 
coming up the lane; 
She stopped a 
moment to look around, 
Just then the wind came, whiz ! 
And exposed to me her pretty foot, 
Well, you know how it is. 
ClIORCTS. 
So listen, now, what I 
tell to you is true, 
She'd a 
catfish mouth, like a 
bursted rubber shoe, 
She's an India rubber yaller gal, 
And wears a 
gingham gown—her maiden name is Liz, 
She threw both feet clean out of sight, 
Well you know how it is. 
I 
offered her my urnbarel, 
She thanked me with a 
smile, 
I 
asked how far from there she lived, 
She said ' twas just a 
mile. 
I 
told her I 
would call on her, 
She said, oh, not for Liz, 
My father he would angry be, 
Well, you know how it is. 
So listen, etc. 
That night she ran away with me, 
To the minister's we went ; 
He asked me what we wanted, 
And if on marriage we were bent; 
He asked rue for the license, then, 
I 
turned around to Liz, 
She smilingly replied to him 
Well, you know how it is. 
So listen, etc.

MY MELINDA. 
DE

met her, 
I 
never shall forget, 
She took my alabaster brow 
And pressed it to her lips. 
And then she whispered loudly, 
You're such a 
handsome chap, 
But she broke my new suspenders, 
When she sat down on my lap. 
Den ado, good-bye, Melinda, 
Oh, don't you cry for me, 
For Pm gwine away to leave you, 
'Way down in Tennessee. 
But I'll come back again, my lub, 
When de corn is on de ear, 
And play on de old jaw-bone once ('lore, 
My own Melinda dear. 
Her neck is like a 
Leer barrel, 
And her shoulders like a 
clam, 
Her ear is like a 
hoe cake, 
And her nose is like a 
ham. 
She's seven foot and over, 
And her hair so awful red, 
Pat she has to get up on a 
cheer, 
When she wants to scratch her head 
Den ado, etc.

How happy I

And when she went to swim, 
I'd open wide my alligate, 
And take Melinda in. 
Den ado, etc. 
I'd like to be a 
little corn 
Upon -
Melinda's ear, 
And when she once begin to scratch,

And den I'd always be with her 
Wherever she would go.

JOLLY CROSS-TOWN NIGS. 
As sung by JOHNEON and POWERS. 
W E'VE just arrived from across the town, 
And we are feeling mighty good, 
You see we're none of those common nigs, 
That hoists coal and shovels wood, 
But we are two of the jolliest coves, 
When dressed up in these rigs, 
We are known both far and near, 
As the jolly cross-town figs. 
CHORUS. 
So good evening all, and how do you do, (Symph.) 
Let the band play whilst we hoist up our she, (
Symph.) 
We throw our feet all out of shape, 
Mind, what we say is true; 
For you can all see at a 
glance 
We're so easy in our great big shoe. 
.11 
You have heard of dancing, dandy Ike, 
And pretty young Alabama Joe, 
Why they are so jealous of us 
That they hardly know what to do. 
But as for them, why, we don't care 
A 
bale of buttons or a 
box of figs; 
They have big feet and can't compete 
With the jolly cross-town figs. 
So good evening, etc. 
Now I 
guess we have said enough, 
About this handsome, stylish pair, 
But while we're singing here to you, 
They will wonder where we are ; 
We've got an invitation to a 
ball, 
So we will change our rigs, 
There will be none there so nobby 
As the jolly cross-town nigs. 
So good evening, etc.

WILL HE COME HOME TO-NIGHT, 
MOTHER 
W ILL Torn come home to-night, mother, 
Or will be stay away 7 
There's a 
something tells me 
lie's drinking hard to-day ; 
He left the shop this morning, 
And started o'er the bill, 
While just a 
pace behind him 
Was drunken, lazy Bill. 
CHORUS. 
Will Tom come home to-night, mother, 
Or will he stay away ? 
There is a 
something tells me 
He's drinking hard to-day. 
Why does he drink so much, mother, 
And why his work neglect ? 
He'll be a 
picture, surely, 
Of liquor's bad effect; 
His Pace is cut and swollen, 
And in his watery eyes 
We miss the look of gladness, 
The blue of Autumn skies. 
Will Tom come home, etc. 
I 
know ' twill break your heart, mother, 
And send you to the grave, 
For it has proved so fruitless 
His character to save ; 
But stop your weeping, mother, 
And keep your spirits bright, 
We'll ask our heavenly Father 
That Tom may come home to-night. 
Will Toni come borne, etc. 
DO 
BRLDGET PICKLE. 
I 
surPosE you have all been in love 
On some occasion or other, 
So have I, with a 
turtle dove, 
And would have married her, but for her brother ; 
Her name is sour, but she is sweet, 
Her cognomen it is Pickles, 
And when I 
ever chance to meet, 
My heart she always tickles. 
CHORUS. 
Bridget Pickle (
Symph.) 
Thou art so fickle, (
S!/mph.) 
With love's sickle, (Symph.) 
Thou has tickled my heart away from me. 
She'd teeth like cross-eyed rows of corn, 
Her countenance was vegetation ; 
She's turned the heads of every swain, 
And dandelion in creation. 
Her cheek is reddish—like a 
beet, 
her turn- up nose with talking wiggles, 
With carroty hair and double ( XX) feet, 
She isn't sour, although she's Pickles. 
Bridget Pickle, etc. 
I 
followed her to her parents' house, 
And saw the number on the door, 
I 
silently glided—quiet as a 
mouse, 
To catch a 
glance of her eye once more. 
She looked at me, oh, my! how sweet, 
L went through my heart like an arrow, 
I'll try some day to marry her, 
Tho' all my feelings she's harrowed.

Ou, look out, fellows, look out, 
And listen to my tale, 
It's not about the walipus, 
Or the hippopotamus whale, 
Nor the jointed crocodile, 
Nor the hump-backed camomile; 
But I'll sing about my sweetheart, 
And her bewitching smile. 
CHORUS. 
Den it's wake up snakes, (Symph.) 
For I'se gwine to work my jaw, (Symph) 
So look out for Johnny Kablumps, 
That came from,Arkansaw. 
Talk about your good things, 
Talk about your bad, 
But were you to see my rosy pink, 
There's no sweeter to be had; 
She's the fairest in the town, 
You would say so could you see, 
Says she loves me with a 
passion, 
And calls me bumble bee. 
Den it's wake up, etc. 
Talk about your dancing, 
Just watch her twist he heel, 
And when she gets a- going, 
Goody, goodness how I 
feel ; 
Oh, my heart it flutters then, 
When I 
see her ' witching eye, 
And when I 
sqeeeze that delicate hand, 
Oh, don't she heave a 
sigh. 
Den it's wake up, etc.

BRIGADIER BRANIGAN. 
W HEN I 
was a 
single young man, the girls they all tried to 
please me; 
To be merry was always my plan, for devil a 
thing could tease 
me; 
I 
was always merry and gay, how I 
jigged it with Judy O'Ca-
la,gan. 
Until, like a 
poor ninny one day, I 'listed with Brigadier Bra-
nigan. 
SFOKEN.—The Brigadier was a 
tall, slim man, about six feet 
five, and as fine a 
looking man as you'd meet in a 
day's walk— 
people used to take me for the Brigadier.—He used to come in-
to my mother's shebeen-shop every morning for a 
noggin of whis-
key, and he'd talk to me about the battles be was in and the 
battles he wasn't in ; about the Generals he killed and the Gen-
erals that killed him, until he had me as full of military ardor 
as an egg is full of meat. 
One morning he said to me, 
" 
Paddy," said he, " will you take a 
shilling's farth 7" 
Said I, 
" 
I 
will, for I'm dead broke this minute." " Oh," said he, " you 
don't understand me, the Queen wants men." " Well," said I, " I 
know plenty of women that want men, besides the Queen." 
No, 
no, that's not what I 
mean," said he, " will you list 7" " I 
don't 
mind if I 
do," said I. 
So I 
donned the regimentals and off I 
started to his 
C/101217S. 
Rub a 
dub dub, a 
dub, doo whack fa lar a 
ladidy, 
Rub a 
dub dub, a 
dub, doo whack fa lar a 
ladidy. 
Soon we were marching away, and over the fields I 
was footing 
it; 
But something told me all the day, arrah, Paddy, you're put-
ting your foot in it; 
Och, bone, how the girls they did cry, especially Judy O'Cala-
gan ; 
Who I 
left with a 
tear in my eye, to go marching with Briga-
dier Branigan. 
SPOKEN.— We were all drawn up in rasp and file—or rank and 
file as the Brigadier called it. 
One fine morning I 
walked over 
to him as polite as you please. " Good morning, your honor," 
said I ; " would you be after taking a 
drop of the creater this 
morning ?" " I 
don't mind if I 
do," said he, so over the road 
(
1) 
BRIGADIER BRANIGAN.—Continued. 
we started to a 
shebeen-shop and I 
called for a 
half pint. I 
was 
pouring out a 
noggin for him, when he grabbed the mug out of 
my hand. " Hould on, Paddy, me boy," said he; " discipline 
among the men. 
The privates are never allowed to drink while 
the officers are around." 
He put the mug to his mouth and 
divil a 
sup he left for poor me. " Fall in !" he cried. " Arrah, 
we'll not fall out," said I. " Stand at ase !" " How can I 
when 
there's a 
big cobble stone under my right foot?" " Forward, 
march !" 
I 
didn't execute the order quick enough, he drew 
his sword and hit me with the flat of it across the hip, which 
made me limp off to his 
Rub a 
dub, etc. 
Soon into battle we went, where the bullets where shooting and 
flying sure ; 
Where many a 
poor fellow lay killed and many another lay 
dying sure; 
A 
bombshell came flying o'er me, I 
was thinking of Judy O'Ca-
laoan ; 
With the Brigadier's head it made free, faith it finished Briga-
dier Branigan. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, there we stood, Murphy on one side, I 
on the 
other and the Brigadier in the middle, when along came a 
bomb-
shell taking the head clean off the Brigadier. " Hurrah !" 
cried Murphy, raising his hand. " We're free at last!" when 
along came another bombshell, taking the band right off of 
Murphy. " Arrah !" cried Murphy, " I've lost me hand ! Pve 
lost me hand !" " Hould your gab, you black- guard," said I, 
" 
there's the Brigadier has lost his head, and divil a 
word he 
says about it." 
I 
went over to where he was lying. " Are you kilt 1" said I 
He didn't condescend to speak to me. " If you have any request 
to make," said I, " if you tell me what it is, I 
will do it for you." 
"Paddy," said he, " I'm not kilt, but I'm murdered, and spach-
less, and if you have any regards for me, you'll be after going 
over the field and looking for my head, place it on my should-
ers, and see me buried decently." " I'll do that same," said I. 
So over the field I 
went, looking for his head ; at last I 
came to 
it, trying to roll over to a 
canteen full of whiskey. 
I 
knew it was his head, for he had a 
big pimple on the side 
of his nose. I 
brought it over to him. " There's your head," said 
I. " No Paddy, that's not my head." " Yes it is," said I. " No, 
it's not," said he. " Well, head or no head," said I, " divil an-
other bead you'll get from me !" So I 
threw his head in his face 
and I 
ran off singing 
(2) 
Rub a

'The aim of the author of " DE

has 
been to strip the art of cooking a 
all useless preparations, and all the un-
meaning jargon of the cuisine; and to write in a 
plain, common-sense way, 
giving only directions that have been tried and not found wanting. 
Every 
mode of Cooking and Preserving described in these pages are the results of 
actual personal experience '•  
and have never f
ailed 
t
o 
produce 
the best tasting 
as well as the best looking dishes that can be placed on the table. 
Let any 
housewife follow the directions, and our word for it; Good digestion will 
surely " wait on appetite."
