Interview 
[00:00] 
Sarah Filkins:  This is Sarah Filkins, Interviewer, with Doris Cole, FAIA,  in Boston, 
Massachusetts at Doris Cole Architecture on November 4, 2019. Good afternoon and thank you 
for agreeing to share your story with us as part of the Library of Congress Occupation Folklife 
Program. 
SF:  
So, let’s—if you could start out by just stating your name and your year of birth. 
Doris Cole: 
My name is Doris Cole and my date of birth is 
 1938. I did want to say 
that we’re in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In fact, I have worked in Boston but I’ve never lived in 
Boston, ever, which is bizarre. It’s one of my goals to try it out sometime. 
SF: 
Oh, well, thank you for clarifying that. 
SF: 
If you could tell us a little bit about what your current position is and your 
responsibilities. 
DC: 
Yes, well I’m now 81 years old which some days seems young and other days seems a 
little older. But what I’m doing now, I’m a sole practitioner. And I’m still active in architecture as 
I define architecture. I think architecture involves office practice but it involves many other 
things and that’s what my career has encompassed. So what I’m doing right now is I’ve been 
asked to write a couple essays—I’m doing that—and I’m designing a house in Uganda. And then 
I have a list of other things that I am supposed to do which I haven’t gotten to in relation to my 
Commentary Posters and other things related to architecture. So that’s what I’m doing now. Also 
I have responsibilities—the house that we’re in, or the building that we’re in, we do own so I get 
to experiment on myself. My husband actually owns the building but it’s my responsibility to see 
that it’s kept up to date and repaired, all those things that happen to a landlord whether it be the 
heating system or the electrical system or the yard or repainting it, etcetera, etcetera. So I have 
that responsibility. And then also my husband is ninety-one years old and he’s not too, too well 
so my responsibilities have increased in taking care of all those things, for him, and that’s a 
whole other job. 
SF: 
Well, tell us about when you were growing up and when you first became aware of 
architecture or the built environment. 
DC: 
Oh, well I was born in Chicago and that is the home of modern architecture, isn’t it? So I 
think I became aware of architecture or the built environment, we would say, when I was born. 
I grew up in Chicago and also in Grand Rapids Michigan which is, we would say also involved 
with architecture because that is where furniture was manufactured. For example, when I was a

teenager and I and my girlfriends would drive out to Lake Michigan, to the beach, we’d drive out 
and when we came to the corner where the Herman Miller factory was, that’s where we’d turn 
left to go to Holland, I think, and right to Grand Haven or vice-versa. And then of course some of 
the people I knew, through my parents were involved in furniture and furniture design—so that 
was Grand Rapids. But also when we lived in Chicago 
[05:00] 
and through my family—my father when he was  a young man, he was born in Chicago and 
grew up there. So he was always the age that the year was—in 1920 he was twenty and 1930 he 
was thirty and that’s when he and my mother married. She was about ten years younger than he. 
But he was the age to enjoy the Roaring 20s. So what he did as a younger man was he built and 
owned real estate and at the time they were—what he owned were called apartment-hotels. So he 
was always involved in building, in construction in some way, though he was not a contractor. 
We would say he was—or he also did some manufacturing of building materials and he was what 
we would call a manufacturer’s manufacturer. He manufactured the materials and then a large 
company would put their name on it. So when the Depression came, with a bang, he lost his 
buildings in Chicago because people didn’t pay their rent and it’s hard to keep your building if 
people don’t pay their rent. So he went to Michigan for business and started his company there 
and did work there. We as a family moved back and forth, back and forth, between Grand Rapids 
and Chicago. So I got a taste of both places for a long time and went to numerous schools as a 
child, both in Chicago and in Grand Rapids. So I think growing up in Chicago, and of course 
looking back, this is all looking back, hindsight is 20/20, if not better. It did influence me. It did 
affect me because that’s what I saw around me and that’s what I heard in my little ears. And I 
liked it—I thought it was interesting. And of course we took the IC [Illinois Central Railroad] 
downtown. We lived in South Shore, at the end of the South Shore Country Club, well where the 
South Shore Country Club was at the end of the “Outer Drive” and about two blocks south of 
that. So we would take the IC into the [Chicago] Loop and of course the Loop was fascinating 
and there were beautiful buildings there. So that certainly gave me a view of the city which I 
enjoyed seeing. Also, when I was a child we took art lessons so I learned about drawing and 
painting and such things. Now I had a sister who also did all these things with me but somehow 
it didn’t influence her to do this. She loved to read and she got her PhD in English literature and 
became a college professor. Her thesis was on Sherwood Anderson who was really the father of 
contemporary or modern, we’d say, American literature, for example F. Scott Fitzgerald, etcetera. 
Sherwood Anderson was a little bit older than these folk. So that gave me more visual orientation 
and then also my mother had a very good friend—Aunt Ruthie I called her—but Ruth 
Rosengrant, who liked to sew. She was fabulous at it, really. Her daughter was Nancy Evans who 
was the lead singer with Wayne King and Aunt Ruthie made all of her evening dresses. So 
anyway, I had a doll where you could make clothes for the doll. So I designed dresses and then I 
would get little beads from Aunt Ruthie that I could put on the dresses and all this kind of stuff. I 
loved it. In fact before I went into architecture I 
[10:00]

was thinking about becoming a fashion designer and this was when we lived in Grand Rapids 
and I was in high school by this time. So one summer I went to stay with my Aunt Rose who was 
a fashion designer and manufactured children’s clothes. And Aunt Rose was very, very nice to 
me, I must say, I made all sorts of mistakes and on and on, but it was fascinating to learn how 
these things were made, not only design but the whole process. However, I decided it was a little 
bit too frivolous for me and I wanted something more serious than fashion design.  
 
One of the things though that I saw as a child riding the IC from South Shore into the 
Loop, was we passed the slums of Chicago. Never in my whole life, any place, in any country, in 
any city, have I seen slums worse than them. This was in the 1940s in Chicago—it was appalling, 
just appalling. So that—I certainly didn’t say to my mother as we rode by, “Oh, look Mommy, 
isn’t that terrible?” No, but I observed and I really even as a little child, I was appalled by what I 
saw. I did have one experience seeing these slums on the ground. My Aunt Rose, when I was 
with her in the summer, she sent me to Michael Reese Hospital to pick up her medication for her. 
So I drove her little car there. I had to park a couple blocks away so I got out—and this is 
Broadway, broad daylight—I was walking towards the hospital and these workmen on a house, 
they were very upset. They said,”Where are you going, What are you doing?” and I said, “Well 
I’m just going to the hospital to pick up something”. And they said, “Well, okay,” but I had the 
idea, from their ladders, that they watched me all the way to the hospital and back before I got in 
my car. And I could see why.  I mean when you looked in the corridors of these buildings it was 
just terrible, terrible conditions. So anyway those are some early experiences that led me to 
architecture. We can go on through college and university or do you have some specific 
questions? 
SF: 
Did you know of any women architects at that time or did you have a mentor or someone 
you really admired that…? 
DC: 
No, I was on my own. No, I had my parents—my mother was very artistically inclined so 
that was always fun and interesting and then of course my father—and their hobby, oh, they 
loved to buy houses and then go live in them and fix them all up. So after a while every time they 
went out on a Sunday, for a Sunday ride, I sort of groaned to myself, Oh no, they’re going to go 
out and find a house they like and off we’d go. It didn’t really happen that often but as I said we 
moved back and forth from Grand Rapids to Chicago. We owned a house in Chicago but in 
Grand Rapids they’d rent these various houses which of course my mother would fix up. So but 
no, I didn’t know any women architects. No, not at all. 
SF: 
So you went to Radcliffe and then you studied architectural sciences. 
DC: 
Oh, yes, so when I was applying for college, I heard about Radcliffe through an article in 
the Saturday Evening Post and the title of the article was, “They’re Wearing Lipstick at Harvard 
Now”. Oh, so I read the article and I thought, Well that sounds interesting. So I applied there and 
I applied at Pembroke which was the girl’s school at Brown University. So somehow I’d gotten it 
in my mind 
Doris Cole Interview, November 4, 2019
Women Architects, afc2019/031

[15:00] 
that I thought it would be interesting to go to a girl’s school but one that had classes with men. 
Don’t ask me why but somehow I’d gotten it in my mind. So we drove out, well we flew and 
then I guess we rented a car and my mother, my sister, and I and a friend of hers, Dorothy 
Greeley, who was originally from Boston but lived in New York City and knew my mother 
through the theater—they were both in the theater in dancing and singing. And of course both 
had changed—because my mother was only nineteen when she got married and Dorothy had 
joined the Red Cross during the World War II and had entertained the troops and when she came 
back she did not continue with her theatrical career. So anyway we came, drove up here—first 
looked around Brown, my sister and I did. And some boys were hanging out their window and 
saying,“Hi.”and oh, we said,“Hi.” back. And then they said, “Why don’t we all go have coffee.” 
So we went—of course had a great time but of course when we went back to the hotel we never 
told my mother what we had done. And so it looked like fun to go there. And then we came up to 
Boston and Harvard and we went to look at Radcliffe. Well, that was a little dowdy. My mother 
was slightly appalled at the living conditions and so forth but she didn’t say too much. You know, 
“Oh you know, well, that looks a little—could use a renovation.” So anyway, we went back and I 
applied to both of them. At that point I was interested in going into fine arts, if I went to 
Radcliffe - art history. And Brown was interesting, or Pembroke, because they had a joint 
program with Rhode Island School of Design, so I could have taken courses there and I thought, 
Well, maybe I’ll go into product design or something like that. So anyway, I just applied to these 
two schools and then my parents sort of thought, Well what are you going to do if you don’t get 
accepted to one of these places? And I said, “Well, I don’t know, well then I guess I’ll apply to 
the University of Michigan as a backup or something.” But I really didn’t think about it too 
much. So anyway, I got accepted in both, Radcliffe and Pembroke. Of course in the meantime I 
could tell my mother had had conversations with her friend Dorothy, in New York, because my 
mother then would come back to me and say, “Well you know, it’s really hard to get in Radcliffe 
so don’t be disappointed if you don’t get in” such and such. “All right Mommy.” Well, I got in 
and I said, “Well Mama, what do you think I should do?” My mother rarely gave opinions and 
directions but she said, “Well, I think you should go to Radcliffe, dear.” And I said, “Okay, I’ll go 
there.”  
 
So I went to Radcliffe and I started out in art history. They had some studio courses but 
really not very many and of  course there were a lot of general education courses I had to take 
also. So I don’t know, the art history I found a little boring, or not very creative. And it was 
primarily to train people to become directors of art museums. Well, it seemed like that might be a 
little bit not what I wanted to do. And somehow while I was at Radcliffe/Harvard, I heard about 
architectural sciences. So I took some courses in that field and I thought that was really nice. I 
really liked that and decided I’d do that. So of course there’s math and physics I had to do but 
also there were a lot of architectural history courses and at that time they were being taught by 
[Eduard] Sekler and [Sigfried] Giedion, and Sigfried Giedion as you know—a big name in 
architectural history, Space, Time & Architecture. So

[20:00] 
as an undergraduate I took those courses, even though they were essentially graduate courses but 
they mixed this up at Harvard. And I really liked that. And then there were some studio courses 
that I took that were, I don’t know, they weren’t attached to the fine arts department. I guess they 
were attached to the architectural sciences department. So I’d bicycle down to the river, to this 
old building, warehouse, at the time—beautiful sunsets we could see from our studio—and we 
took various courses in form, or more abstract, not really life-drawing courses, though I did take 
some life-drawing courses at the Cambridge Center for Adult Education and that was nice. So 
when I was there, one of my instructors was Marico, who was an Italian artist, quite well known 
actually, who was teaching at Harvard with I would say, basic English. But he was my instructor 
and that was a big deal too. So one of the classes—studios we took, was to do three dimensional 
work and there were a couple of things and this was to train one, as an introduction to 
architecture, so one of them was to do this board—it was white board—and then we were 
supposed to cut up white board and put it on our square board in some three dimensional way. 
Oh okay, well fortunately there was a paper cutter because I tried cutting my cardboard but I 
really wasn’t strong enough to do it, so I went there and I whacked out these triangles and put 
them all up, I glued them up and they loved it. Good. And then the other thing we had to do, I 
remember distinctly, was we had to, out of cored cardboard, build a mold out of the cardboard, 
fill it up with plaster and then let it dry and peel the plaster off and we would have a three 
dimensional form. Okay, so all these guys in the class are cutting these curved things out with 
their knives on the cardboard and pasting them together, and taping them together and all of this 
stuff. So I tried that but I wasn’t strong enough again. So I went to my favorite paper cutter and I 
cut this stuff out and then everything was peaked, nothing curved, cuz I couldn’t do it, and they 
were all jutting out from the core. And then I filled it up with plaster and everything went well 
and then it dried and I pulled off the cardboard. Well, Marico loved it and in his broken English 
said,“Ah, yes it’s pointing out this way and that and that—very, you know, dynamic—strong.” I 
was pleased. I sat there and smiled. Meanwhile the guys, they are putting the plaster in their 
molds and they were breaking and all this plaster was falling all over the tables and floors and so 
forth. I just smiled sweetly. So that was, as I said in one of my Commentary Posters, was a lesson 
of making do with what you have, or what you can do. So anyway, as I proceeded on at 
Radcliffe/Harvard in architectural sciences, it was preparing one to apply to graduate school. So I 
thought, Well I’ll apply to the Harvard Graduate School of Design [GSD]. And my father said, 
you know, “What do you know how to do Doris?” and I said, “Not much Daddy.” And he said, 
“Well maybe you should go to graduate school and learn how to be an architect.” They were all 
for that. He thought that was a great idea. So I applied to Harvard. Again my parents didn’t say 
anything. It was only years later that my mother said, “Well, we did think it was a little cheeky 
that you only applied to Harvard.” But I didn’t know any better. See I just  
[25:00] 
thought that since I went to Radcliffe College they would accept me. It never occurred to me that 
they wouldn’t. And actually a very nice guy I knew at Harvard College, he had applied and I

found out he did not get accepted. I was shocked. So anyway, I went there. I did graduate cum 
laude from Radcliffe. I would not say that I was a very diligent student but I did feel that, you 
know, I wasn’t going to try for summa or magna but I had to at least make cum laude to sort of 
keep up standards. So I did that and so I think that probably helped me too and I had done well in 
my architectural sciences courses. I must say, one of the things I learned—we had to do a math 
class, so I did pretty well and of course these people—people’d get together in the evening to do 
the problems together. Well, I did that once or twice and I thought, I don’t think I need this, I can 
do as well on my own, why should I waste my time with these people. So I did fairly well but I 
learned in taking that math course, that I was not a mathematician. I could not think in 
mathematics. Mathematics is another language and its become more and more important as time 
goes on in science or in physics, in all of these things that they explain—at least they think they 
do—explain what’s going on. Or let’s say they describe what’s going on in mathematical 
language, using math as language and I really was not up to that. So that was good to learn I 
suppose. So then I went to the Harvard Graduate School of Design. 
SF: 
And when you were in the architectural sciences program at, when you were at Radcliffe, 
how many other women—were there any women studying in that same major? 
DC: 
Not that I knew, except my freshman roommate - Judith Orcoffer. She went to the GSD in 
planning and actually we shared an apartment for two years while she was getting her planning 
degree. Now, when I was at the GSD, they did have a program then at Radcliffe/Harvard, that 
you as a senior in college, you could do your first year at the School of Design—of course it’s 
very tough. However, there was a young woman, Betsy Porter, who was in my class at the GSD 
who was doing that and a fellow Lionel Spiro who was also doing that but when I was at 
Radcliffe, I didn’t know people [women] who were in architectural sciences. I did know some 
who I think were in planning—Adele Logan, who has written several books about her ancestors 
and Deborah Cole who also became a planner who I believe was in my class at Radcliffe. But no, 
I did not know anyone. 
SF: 
So when you started at the Graduate School of Design, how many women were in your 
class that year? 
DC: 
Well at the time, the classes were much smaller than they are now. There were probably 
about thirty people in my class at the GSD and about three of us were women. So if you do 
percentage wise, that’s not so bad, is it? So there were not a lot of us but I didn’t feel particularly 
strained by it, at least with my classmates. 
SF: 
So how many years at the Graduate School of Design? Was that three years there or two? 
[30:00] 
DC:  
No, no, it was a program that lasted three and a half years and one came out with a 
professional degree—took me four years. I had a run-in with one of the professors—Serge 
Doris Cole Interview, November 4, 2019
Women Architects, afc2019/031

Chermayeff—who was horrible, not just to women, but to anybody he could be horrible to. So I 
had him the first year—and some people left because of him—he was really rude, and terrible 
and mean and awful and then unfortunately he changed—so you know, I thought, Oh, good 
riddance, I’m gone, first year goodbye Chermayeff. He went on and changed to second year. So I 
think it was the second year, maybe it was the third year. I had him all over again. Uhh! So he 
and some of the others, were not great. They had their own problems, psychologically and of 
course I suppose, among themselves in the faculty. Chermayeff tried to have a coup against Sert, 
Josep Luís Sert, and sort of finagled the students to go with him on that. But he—well, he didn’t 
like women. He used to try to beat up on Betsy Porter too but we all laughed because she really 
would get all upset and we’d laugh and say Betsy’s the only one can scare him. But he—he 
meddled. He didn’t like my lifestyle and he essentially told me that—because I had a boyfriend 
who was in my class. We were discreet, we didn’t do anything around class or anything. And it 
really was because of this boyfriend who kept me laughing and encouraged me that I survived. 
Without him, I don’t think I would have survived. So old Chermayeff didn’t like my lifestyle and 
he told me that and that was in the last run-in. So I took a half a year off because he was—after 
that half year he was going to Yale on a sabbatical and everybody told me he’d never show up 
again.  
 
So it was that and then there were other things too that were just bizarre. We had this 
professor, younger fellow. He was okay but he drank a lot and he’d invite us all over to his house 
for a party. We did that, a lot of mingling, and his wife would get drunk and then she’d corner me 
and sort of say nasty things to me. And she’d say,”Well, because you’re attractive you think you 
can do anything you want to and blah-blah-blah”. Well, I wasn’t that attractive you know. So that 
was very, very disconcerting and really not, not good. Now-a-days they wouldn’t—well, they 
wouldn’t get away with that, well, if anyone reported it. I don’t remember other faculty being at 
those parties. It would be them and not other faculty. So we were at their mercy, weren’t we?  
Because they held our future in their hands. I don’t even know if they understood how powerful 
they were, or maybe they did and they liked it, didn’t they? But it was—it is that still, that they 
could make or break our lives, our professional lives, our personal lives, everything. And I think 
they played  
[35:00] 
upon that and took advantage of it. You know, very psychological and bizarre and in a 
psychologically sick way. 
SF: 
Were you—was it a very ego driven sort of macho environment? Were you expected—
were there lots of all-nighters and … 
DC: 
Well, that’s with everybody—that’s gender neutral—of all-nighters, and deadlines, and 
crits, and a certain meanness—toughen us up. But that happened to the men as well as the 
women. So, it was not macho in that sense. However, it was primarily males and male teachers 
except for Jackie Turwick who was in planning. So their interests were the interests of men. I 
mean there was never any discussion about children. How were you going to have children and

work? That was not a discussion because it was primarily men. There was no discussion about 
well, how are you going to get a job—because these men could get jobs, if you know, they found 
an office that had an opening. But there was like, one of the young teachers, a nice guy, but he 
worked in an office in Boston. They had a policy of not hiring women—that was it—they didn’t 
hire women. So I remember one time I was looking for a job and I was passing by his office so I 
went in with my portfolio. I asked for him and he came to see me and we went to the studio 
office and I was showing him my portfolio and he said, “Doris, why are you here? You know we 
don’t hire women.” I said,“Well I thought I’d just let you know—give it a try.” (laughs) 
SF: 
So when you graduated, if you could talk a little bit about your first jobs and searching 
for a job and looking for that right… 
DC: 
Well during the summer, when I was in school, I worked in New York for—what were 
they called—they keep changing their name—something Smith, Smith and Barnes—and the first 
name. It wasn’t Raymond, it was—I can’t remember but—it was Voorhees, Walker, Smith, Smith 
and Haynes. Walker was quite well known and he was very old when I worked there one summer 
but they had a program where they would take students of architecture in their internship 
program and we worked in the office and then they took us on excursions. I went to—some of it 
was really interesting. They took us to the Seagram Building and we met the woman who started 
the architectural museum in Canada [Canadian Centre for Architecture], the Seagram’s woman 
[Phyllis Lambert]. I forget her name right now. 
SF:  
In Montreal? 
DC: 
Yeah, oh yeah, she was there to greet us because she knew one of the younger fellows 
who worked in the office and so he could get her to come and show it to her—I should remember 
her name. So that was very exciting and then we went up to Walker’s house also for a lunch 
afternoon one day and it was really very nice to meet him. Cuz he had been—their office had 
designed one of the sort of the classic skyscrapers in New York and so it was very exciting to see 
him and to meet him—he was very nice—and also to see his house and how he had done it and 
the garden and everything. So that’s what I did one summer.  
[40:00] 
And then another summer I worked here in Boston for the Boston Redevelopment Authority. 
And that was very interesting. We worked down in Fanueil Hall, which is Fanueil Hall 
Marketplace building now and when you go in now, under the dome there’s a big hole cut out, 
well I worked on the second floor where they had cut out that dome later on. So I worked there 
and learned a lot. And I could go down the hall and see this fabulous model they were building of 
Boston and I learned about the city and city planning and the neighborhoods of Boston, etcetera. 
So then when I finished graduate school, that was in 1963, so I thought, Well I guess I’ll get 
another job. My father had suggested that I, “Well why don’t you go to Chicago.” We have 
family there. And he knew people at Perkins and Will somehow and said,”I could get you a job

11
there, dear.” Oh well, I thought about that and then we had a cousin in Dallas, my cousin Harold 
who was actually close to my father’s age, cuz my father was the youngest of about eleven 
children so his two nephews, Harold Cole and Dres Ager, were about his age and the three of 
them were really good friends, not just uncle and nephew. So Cousin Harold was one of my 
favorites, I must say—a dashing man. So I thought about that but I wasn’t too sure about Dallas. 
So anyway, I decided I’d go to Paris. Well, my mother was more congenial about the idea, she 
said, “Well, if you don’t go, you’ll aways think you should have.” My father was like,“Why do 
you want to go there?” I did get some letters of reference from a Frenchman who was teaching at 
Harvard and had an office in Paris, it was just outside of Paris and [Jean-Louis] Véret, his name 
was. And then Jaqueline Tyrwhitt—she thought I should go to one of the Scandinavian countries. 
But I thought, No, I think I want to go to Paris. And she gave me a letter of reference to Shadrach 
Woods who was at that time had won the—I think he had already won it or maybe it was during 
the competition—for the University of Berlin which he did design and build. So I’m not sure if 
he had yet won that. So I went to Paris. My father really was uncomfortable with the idea. And 
once I got to Paris and knew more about Paris and Europe and the Second World War, I didn’t 
really feel comfortable there and I understood why my father would never go to Europe. My 
grandfather had come in long before the Second World War, in the early 1970s, he had come to 
the United States but we’re a Jewish family and well it’s not comfortable. There were a lot of 
ghosts there in the1963 just as there are now today. They’re coming back. So but it was a good 
experience. If I had not gone I would have always thought I should have gone. So I worked in 
Paris and lived there and learned the language somewhat and had that whole experience—
Parisian experience. I worked for Shadrach Woods, for I guess it was on the competition, and 
then I left there and I worked for this architect I’ll leave nameless. He was really a boorish wall 
kind of office. 
[45:00] 
And I stayed there a while. He had me, he thought he was doing me a big favor. He had assigned 
me to design French cafés. I mean what did I know about French cafés? Nothing, but they had 
the contract for the new Les Halles because it had been in Paris then and then they moved it 
outside of Paris and his office had the contract for doing all of that—for designing it all. So here 
I am designing these French cafés that were going to go in to Les Halles. But you know, I didn’t 
think it was quite for me. So I ended up working for Véret and that was marvelous—I thought it 
was so funny. I would—I lived in Paris in the—first I lived on the Left Bank but then my 
girlfriend and I there, who I met through renting from the same man who was a little lecherous, 
but we would go out to lunch together and discuss it and so we both left and found an apartment 
near, across the park from the old Bibliothèque Nationale which was near the opera. She was a 
surgical nurse and she was Danish and I was an American architect. How we found that 
apartment was—I don’t know, you know young people hang out in cafes and one knows another 
and so forth—through an American architect I knew who was working in Paris. And it was a 
great apartment. It had been redone by an American architect. And [Richard] Roth [Jr.] is a New 
York—the son of a big New York architect who did a lot of high rises. It was he and he was

going back to New York to take over his father’s firm. So we got the apartment. So it was up on, 
I think, the fourth or fifth floor—so it was one of those old buildings— 
SF: 
Walk-up? 
DC: 
Oh walk-up, for sure. So you’d press the button and the light was on a timer so you’d 
press the button and you had to walk quickly to get to the next floor because the light would go 
out and you’d be in total darkness so then you’d be on the next floor hopefully and you’d press 
the next button and on you would go up to our place. So it was a climb up, you tried not to forget 
anything when you went off to work. A girlfriend of mine, (laughs) well she came to visit me one 
time, daylight, and she was with a Vietnamese architect—was living with him in Paris and they 
eventually got married—I remember hearing the bell ring and I went “Rita, hi.” And she said, “I 
didn’t know I was so old until I climbed up to this apartment.” So I lived there and Véret’s office 
was just south of Paris so that was great. I’d get on the Metro [Paris Metro] with my French 
newspaper and I could read, I didn’t have to look for the stop because I went all the way to the 
end of the line. So I’d go all the way to the end of the line—all of these people peeling off 
various stops, you know stops for good. So I’d get off and then I’d take a bus usually, several 
blocks to his office. Usually we’d walk back and forth but if I was in a rush I’d take a bus. So 
have you ever seen that movie Mon Oncle—and it was this French movie—their sense of humor, 
where it was this very modern house and with a wall around the garden. And they’d press a 
buzzer and then this woman would click out in her high heels over stones and a little pool and 
open up the door and so forth. Well, it was a little bit like that I thought. So he had his office 
behind his father’s house. So his father’s house was this sort of traditional stone, not a huge 
house in a suburb or country. It would be what the French thought as country—stones and so.  
[50:00] 
So we’d go in and then we’d go towards the back, click-click-click-click on the stone path, and 
then there was this little modern building. So there was a low part and then I was in the upper 
part with myself, an Italian woman and this Swiss guy. I can’t remember their names but they 
were very nice. So about ten or eleven in the morning—Umm, we could smell chocolate because 
our wall, of our part we were in, was adjacent to a chocolate factory on the other side. So these 
wonderful fumes would come over to us and of course it made us thirsty, (laughs) not thirsty, but 
hungry to hear all this. And they did interesting work. They were doing some villas in the south 
of France. I worked on those—again I didn’t know much, you know I was so ignorant and 
stupid. One of the reasons I decided to go to France was I thought I wouldn’t be able to get an 
interesting job in the United States. What would I end up doing—toilet details? And so I might as 
well go to France, I’d work and then I’d come back and I’d say, “Well, I had a years experience”. 
So they’d think I knew how to do something which of course I didn’t know anyway. So that was 
my—so those were my first jobs and then I did travel a bit in France. Tolva, who was my Danish 
apartment mate and I went on a couple trips. When she’d come back home from the hospital, 
she’d pass this travel agency that was for French people and they had these bus trips you could 
take. I mean some were joie—you couldn’t imagine it. So she’d sign us up and we’d go. One of

them went east to Mont-Saint-Michel and then around, stopped different places, and came back 
to Paris, for a weekend. So there we were on the bus. We were the only people who weren’t 
French. And I remember they stopped to pick up some people who were late. Well, did these 
French bourgeoise really give them hell when they got on the bus, so there were Tolva and I 
sitting there. And Tolva’s French was much better since you know she had to operate on people 
or hand them all the stuff that they wanted. So we did that trip and actually I went back many, 
many, many, years later to Mont-Saint-Michel with my husband Hal Goyette. And of course, you 
know, there’s always that possibility you’re going to be very disappointed to go back someplace 
where you had been. But we went back and it was heavenly. You know during the day they’re 
lots of tourists, and a lot of French tourists, a lot of school children—they bring them there—but 
in the evening they all leave. There we were, Hal and I, with the loud speaker telling you, you’d 
better move your car on the upper level or move because you would be flooded. Okay, we had 
parked on the upper level and then it’d become all quiet and all foggy and we would wander 
around and it was just so enthralling, we really—it was just marvelous.  
 
So another trip that Tolva and I took, she had selected it—we were going to go east in the 
bus with these French—all a little stout, you know. And we went to Strasbourg and then came 
back and stopped various places. Well, of course, it was sort of in the middle of the winter, cold, 
cloudy, gloomy. I remember we’re all standing there in the middle of Strasbourg looking at, for 
nests of these storks—and trying to see a stork. Well, there weren’t any and it was so cold and 
cloudy. And then she found another one when we went and looked at the chateaus. That was very 
nice too. I think there was one person on the bus—another person who was not French. So that 
was my first working experience. So I came home after that.  
[55:00] 
My mother was in hysteria because Goldwater was running. She said, “You’ve got to come home 
and vote, dear.” So I did. I thought I was going back, not to Europe, but to beyond, but that didn’t 
work out. And when I realized it was not going to work out, I was in New York and then in 
Cambridge. So I stayed in Cambridge and then got an apartment and been here ever since. So the 
first place I worked in Cambridge was again for a friend of mine who was starting an office. And 
he was starting an office that was going to be architecture and graphics. So he was the architect 
and then two fellows were the graphic designers. They had work. I’m not sure that there was…
We had some work in the architecture because before Jim Smith started the office, he had 
worked for Techbuilt who were doing these pre-fab houses. I think it was Techbuilt. Or maybe it 
was Deck Built. So when he started his own office he got some jobs from them to draw up 
houses and to design them and so forth. So that’s what kept us going for a while but he ran out of 
work after a while so then I had to go find another job. And then I think it was more of a sort of a 
real job. It was Tim Anderson and Associates and Tim was quite a character. We were down in 
the Prince Spaghetti building [Prince Building] which Tim I think owned; he was part of a 
developer there, architect/developer in this building. So there was construction going on above 
us, below us, all this kind of stuff and I also got a position teaching part-time at RISD [Rhode 
Island School of Design]. And I got that through Walter Bodener who had been—he would have 
been in administration when I was at Harvard—but he was a sympathetic guy and when I had 
Doris Cole Interview, November 4, 2019
Women Architects, afc2019/031
14
trouble with Chermayeff, he was kindly, very kindly. So he was the one who said, “Oh yeah, 
yeah, take the semester off and come back and then you can finish up”. So he was—obviously he 
was not a great admirer of Chermayeff. He couldn’t do anything about what Chermayeff had 
done or was doing to me but he could sympathize with me and be on my side so that it did not 
totally ruin me. So I did that too while I was working in Tim’s office. And again there were a lot 
of young people and so we all were friendly and went to parties together, so forth and so on. And 
Tim was a bit of a character, I must say, and one time when we were at the Prince Spaghetti 
building and I had been at RISD that afternoon and I came back the next morning, and there 
were these burn holes in my drawing. And I said, “What’s happened?” And he said, ”Well, you 
know, they were doing some welding up above you and a few of the sparks came down, Doris, 
and left some burn holes in your drawing. “Oh,” I said. But Tim, well he liked ladies, he liked 
women, okay we knew that, but also I’d brought back all these great clothes from Paris so I’d 
dress up to come to work. You know, dress for the position you want, not the one you have. So 
one of the guys working there, he asked me to make prints. Because Tim had purchased one of 
these old print machines, with the ammonia in it and we made prints and so forth. So I said, “Oh, 
okay.” You know, I’m there at the machine making prints and Tim comes by and he says, “What 
are you doing Doris?” I said, “Well I am making prints. I was asked to make prints. That’s what I 
am doing.” And he said, “Go back to your desk.” Oh? So I went back to my desk. And he told 
this guy, “She doesn’t make prints.  
[01:00:00] 
She’s an architect, that’s not what she does”.  Ooo, I realized, oh okay. And then he did hire a gal 
Friday, Jill Underwood her name was, of Underwood ham [William Underwood Company] as 
she told us from time to time. She made prints because that was her job. It wasn’t that he was 
sexist about it. It’s just that in my cute little fake Dior suit, I was not supposed to be there making 
prints so I, oh, I sort of appreciated that and I got a really good project to do also. 
SF: 
Which was? 
DC: 
The Fuller Art Museum which is now the Fuller Craft Museum in Brockton,
[Massachusetts] outside of Brockton and that was a wonderful project and so I got to do that and 
again I didn’t know what I was doing. And so he helped as much as he could. He had two 
associates in the firm. One of them, I think really wanted my project. He—he didn’t help me. I 
mean, obviously I didn’t know what the hell I was doing. He didn’t hinder me but he certainly 
didn’t take me under his wing and help me. So I did the design. 
SF: 
Do you think that was because of gender or just… 
] 
DC: 
He just wanted the job.   
SF: 
He wanted the job.

DC: 
You asked about gender—now, somehow we knew which offices hired women and which 
did not. So we—I would go to an office for an interview and there would be other women 
working there. So offices didn’t hire just one woman. They hired a bunch of us because they 
liked having women in the office. We worked hard. We probably earned less, a little bit less. So 
that was it. So in terms of gender, it was simply knowing and we knew, which offices hired 
women. Even today, it might not be which offices hire women but the young women know 
which offices where women can get ahead. They know and they’re some offices today, where 
yes they have women but they’re known not to be offices that are compatible for women. So it’s 
that way. So I—I wanted to learn how to put a building together and a lot of young architects 
reach this point in their career so I changed and went to Drummey Rosane Anderson. [DRA] 
They had women. They were located outside of Boston slightly, or out of Cambridge. So some of 
the women that they had, were actually married and had children and lived out in the suburbs so 
they would sort of come into the office a little bit late and so forth but you know, they were very 
capable people. So again, it was an office that hired women. Did women get ahead in that office? 
We didn’t really have a chance to find out because business went very bad and there was a big 
recession and so the office really shrunk and then, yeah they went through some very bad 
periods. So there 
[01:05:00] 
I learned how to put a building together. Sometimes there would be not—maybe uncomfortable 
situations with male clients. Sometimes encouraged by the owner of the firm I was working for. 
Sometimes just you know, it happened and we would all try to get through it in some way but in 
general not really discrimination because there would be many of us—several of us in the office. 
So when their office really had to let people go, I worked for Flansburgh [Architects] briefly. But 
then I got a position at MIT in their in-house office and I was there eight and a half years. And 
that was interesting. My job was to do space programming and they had a system set up for that 
which I followed and elaborated on and it was for laboratories, dormitories, whatever—whatever 
they—oh, athletic facilities and so forth. So that was interesting because when I worked for DRA 
the clients—we did a lot of school, educational whatever. The client would come to us and they 
had made decisions that should not have been made and here we were trying to work our way 
through these things—wrong site, wrong budget, program wasn’t so good, you know. Why are 
we even doing this? On and on, so working at MIT it was essentially future programming, 
planning for facilities at MIT. So I learned a lot there and found that gratifying. Then also at the 
time it was a very flat pyramid or pointy pyramid—I don’t know which it would be. But I would 
go with my boss with meetings with the provost and senior vice presidents and so forth and so 
on. So that was you know, quite different than other places and so I learned a lot there. And then, 
you know, after eight and a half years—well I had been married before that to Sergio Baresi. I 
guess I was married to him in 1970 and then after I was married to him I went to work at MIT. 
He was very impressed—I increased my salary by a third when I went to MIT. That was nice. 
And when I was married to Sergio I wrote my first book From Tipi to Skyscraper; a history of 
women in architecture. That was the first book on women in architecture in the United States. 
Doris Cole Interview, November 4, 2019
Women Architects, afc2019/031
16
Why did I write that book? Well, I wrote that book because when I was at DRA this fellow who 
was supposedly the office manager, Kevin O’Mara, and he asked me one time, “What are you 
doing here Doris Cole, what are you doing here?” I said, “Kevin, I’m here being an architect like 
you.” And he laughed and with that Irish wit and two little dimples and he said, “Oh come on 
Doris. You are just going to marry one of your boyfriends.” Ah, Kevin you shouldn’t say things 
like that. So my first book Tipi to Skyscraper was an answer to that question, What am I doing 
here? When I wrote the book I realized I really had to examine architecture and redefine 
architecture to find women’s role in architecture. 
[01:10:00] 
And that’s essentially what Tipi to Skyscraper did. If I went the usual route of these people who 
are out there in the field designing—Arc-hi-tects, capital A—there were very few women but if I 
looked at architecture as how it formed our environments and our worlds—for example, women
—indigenous women not only designed, constructed and owned tipis. Oh, well isn’t that 
interesting? Things like that. One had to go back and relook at this because I mean, why not? 
You didn’t need a license to practice architecture. Now it’s different, an architect—you have to 
have a license or else it’s illegal to call yourself an architect. They codified all that but there are 
designers—architectural designers. So anyway, Sergio, he had had his own office in Italy. He 
didn’t really feel like opening an office with me. He was at the Architects Collaborative and 
became an associate there. We did design our house out in Concord together but I always think it 
was mainly his design ability. But it was a long process because we couldn’t finish it all. You 
know.  
SF: 
You had to agree. 
DC: 
Yeah, you know. And then he died. Sergio died in 1976. It was tragedy. He had cancer 
and he died. So meanwhile before he died, I had gone to MIT increasing my salary by a third. So 
he died and that was that. So sometimes you know, it was terrible to watch somebody die. It was 
a misdiagnosis—and, but he might have died anyway or lingered on and been very ill. So his 
family was from Milan [Italy], his parents lived there, so we had visited there often and travelled 
in Italy and that really expanded my world also. Of course it ruined my French because I had to 
learn some Italian. His father spoke perfect English and Italian and his mother spoke French and 
Italian. Well, we couldn’t do three languages at the dinner table. It was too difficult. All right, so, 
at MIT and then I met Hal Goyette. I knew him already because he had—he and Sergio had been 
friends so I had known Hal really a number of years, maybe close to ten years before we got 
married because I had known of him also before I had married Hal. I had never dated him but I 
knew of him. So that continued on—my life which was very nice. Hal and Sergio had sailed 
together aside from being architects. So I was at MIT and then things happened so Hal and I—or 
I decided I’d leave MIT. There was a little incident there. And I decided I’d start my own office.  
And then Hal soon joined me and we started our office here, and we were essentially known 
quantities—Doris Cole, Hal Goyette, and so we named our firm that. And I wrote another book, 
about Eleanor Raymond. She was really a friend and a mentor. I’d got to know her through my 
Doris Cole Interview, November 4, 2019
Women Architects, afc2019/031
17
first book. And because of the book I’d written about her during our office, when we were first 
starting our office, I had a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts to do, research and 
write a book on  
[01:15:00] 
Howe, Manning and Almay and also because of my book on Eleanor I had been invited to be the 
guest curator or adjunct curator, or both, at the Institute of Contemporary Art that was then 
located right in Boston behind the BAC [Boston Architectural College] and so that was good for 
our office and it was nice for me to do that. And then also to get the grant from the government 
was great. It came with money so I could buy a camera and I think we bought our first typewriter 
too. (laughs) And we got various projects and stuff and we were quite successful in our office 
cuz Hal was very experienced. He went back at like age fifty and took the exams and got his 
license. 
SF: 
And how about you. When did you take yours? [architectural licensing exams] 
 
DC: 
Oh, I took mine right after I came back from Paris. Yes, I took my exams then. 
SF: 
The four day or five day? 
DC: 
Yeah, actually I’d go down to New York City to visit friends, and take my exams there 
because they gave them more than once a year so I didn’t expect I was going to pass all of them 
at one time. So I could go down there and take them. And I did, I finally passed and it was good, 
I had a license in New York. It was good and from there I could get certified by NCARB 
[National Council of Architectural Registration Boards] and that gave me access to getting 
licenses wherever I went, pretty much every place except maybe California because of the 
earthquakes and I‘d never really planned to practice in California. But all the other states, where 
ever I wanted, I could get a license really through NCARB. I think even in California NCARB 
would be all right but they had a section on earthquakes that you had to take. Of course now 
they’ve discovered we have earthquakes in Massachusetts. But not like California. So Hal and I 
had our office for a long time—nearly thirty years. In 20-0-8, two-thousand eight, Hal decided he 
wanted to retire. He was eighty-one and he decided he wanted to retire and I said, “Well, okay.” 
So I decided I would go with him and we moved back here. We had been up on Mass 
[Massachusetts] Avenue in a nice fancy office for I don’t know, I think eight years or something 
like that. And yeah, eight years—it had been a five year lease at an exorbitant rent and then we 
rented it for another three years at half the rent we had paid, yearly rent. 
SF: 
How did you do that? 
DC: 
We did that because it was no longer boom times for real estate people. So we had some 
middle management people in our firm and we wondered if they’d like to take it over. Well, they 
thought about it—I’m just going to have a drink of water—and they decided they didn’t really 
Doris Cole Interview, November 4, 2019
Women Architects, afc2019/031
18
want to take it over. But they wanted to start a new firm. So they named it CGKV Architects, 
kept the C and G on it and started their own firm. Well, it was in 2008—it couldn’t have been a 
worse time to start a firm. Nobody had any work, they were closing up offices. However we had 
a contract with Massport [Massachusetts Port Authority] to do sound insulation. We had done a 
lot of work for Massport—in fact that was our bread and butter project. For an office to survive it 
really needs a bread and butter project. So we had this contract and these two fellows had run 
[01:20:00]   
a lot of these projects so Massport knew them, they were comfortable for them, so we transferred 
that project to them and it gave them like a million dollars worth of work to start their office. I 
was glad I could help them and so it was Jason, Ernie and Alina, the three of them, started this 
office and they have been going ever since. Of course, branched out from there and gotten other 
work and have been doing fairly well, quite well. Of course I think they are talented and they 
should have more elaborate projects than they have but they like what they are doing, they earn a 
living, they find it interesting, they’re proud and pleased with their work and that’s what you 
want. Of course, you know, they—they wanted to do it on their own. Mother I‘d rather do it 
myself. Fine, if I can be of help, let me know. But Hal and I really were very hands off. For the 
first couple of years, we had a few projects we had to finish up so all of us worked together on 
those to finish them up. Ugh, it was endless—partly because of contractors. One of them, the 
building was finished, it was being occupied, but the contractor had not finished his paperwork 
so we could not close out the project which meant we could not close on our insurance. So we 
did—but Hal and I did fine. That closing the office—was long term and quite expensive because 
we carried the insurance for the seven years to be sure everything was cleared up. So meanwhile, 
we moved back here. And I started—I didn’t want to give up architecture. I continued on with 
Doris Cole, FAIA, Architecture and Planning. And Hal continued on making DVD movies on 
our travels and on architecture. And he learned it all on his own and did all this. And it was 
marvelous. So if you look up here on the shelf, here are some of the ones he did. There are 
several copies of each one.  But he did all of those. The first one he did was on the Korean War. 
He was in the Navy during that and he was on a destroyer. And he, as a young officer, he was in 
charge of the camera of taking photographs to document what they were doing. So he did that 
and when he left the Navy after going on with this, he got to take some of these pictures with 
him. So that was very interesting because it gave a young officer’s view of what it was like to be 
at war. And their job was to move our troops back and forth—they’d pick them up on the West 
Coast move them around and go to the East Coast and then they’d take people there from the 
East Coast around to the West Coast—back and forth, back and forth. They got shot at and they 
shot back but as he said, “Fortunately they didn’t have very good aim and at least we got to sleep 
in clean sheets at night”.  So we went on with various—we travelled quite a bit in Egypt, India, 
Germany, Spain, England France, so forth and so on. Oh, we went to Finland doing the 
pilgrimage essentially to see [Alvar] Aalto’s work and so he would come back and make DVD 
movies of these travels. And that was great so that’s how we spent our time since having our 
office. When we were running Cole and Goyette,  
Doris Cole Interview, November 4, 2019
Women Architects, afc2019/031
19
[01:25:00] 
we would say we were a boutique office. We had a dozen people and maybe two dozen 
computers. It was endless. And we always tried to keep a balance in our staff between the men 
and the women. Sometimes it was hard to—difficult to find women to hire. By this time they 
were in demand because you know in 1964 the Civil Rights Act was passed and that’s what made 
the difference. When I was young and looking for a job—it made a difference in a lot of 
women’s lives, not just minorities. For example banks hired a lot of women. Why? Not because 
they loved women but because they were required to do that by the Federal Government and if 
they didn’t do it, the Federal Government was not going to do business with them. So this went 
on in—when we were running our office—we started our office in 1981 and we closed it in 
2008. That’s a big span of time and it went through many transitions culturally in our nation so 
we followed all that in our office. I’d hire these young women and I’d say, “So, you know, why 
do you want to work here ?” Once we’d hired them—we’d be driving someplace and I’d say, 
“Well, you know, why here? They’re a lot of other offices.” And this one young woman said, 
“Well I was working such and such a place. It was like working in a men’s locker room.” So 
she’d come to—I guess we were known on the circuit, that we hired women and they got to do 
something in our office. And it always amazed me because, believe me, I was not a sweet and 
cuddly boss, at all. It was not my personality, that’s not how I did business, etcetera, etcetera, but 
they felt comfortable with us. And I guess, there was—even in my own office, I did feel a little 
tug and pull of gender. Of course my partner, Hal Goyette would’ve never said that and if I 
mentioned something he said, “Oh no, no, no”. But I felt it.  And certainly with clients and 
getting work. I thought Hal was going to market and get all the work, well it turned out he didn’t 
like to do that. What? So I had to do it, so that was a little bit more limiting and we did a lot of 
public work. One, because they had to check off that box that it was a woman owned firm. And 
we were—I owned 60% of the firm; Hal owned 40%. Some of our clients, even though they 
hired a woman owned firm, they got to work with Hal and one of them—one of the clients 
said,“Well you know Hal, I’m glad I get to work with you because,” he said, “you know I just, I 
don’t mean to be this way, but I don’t feel comfortable working with a woman. So it’s good we 
have a woman owned firm, I can show that to my board but I get to work with you.” 
SF: 
What were your experiences on construction sites and construction management or… 
DC: 
Oh, I—I didn’t have trouble with that. Partly it was because of my experience as a 
teenager and I guess when I was in college. My father had this company called Wall Tile 
Company and they sold building materials. They manufactured some but essentially they sold 
them. So I decided one summer—this poor man—I said, “Oh I wanted to work, you know 
Daddy.” “Oh.” And I said,“Well maybe I could work in your office?” And oh, so he would come 
home and pick me up, take me to his office so I would sort of take care of the office when

his secretary was out to lunch. And I don’t know, he was out too. I don’t know what he was 
doing. So anyway, I would be there and these contractors would come in to order materials or 
just to sit around and talk. You know, and they were being kind to me. They were always very 
nice to me and I’d talk to them and they’d talk to me. So it really made me realize these 
contractors were people and they were very nice, you know. So when I grew up and I’m on a job 
site, I didn’t have any problems but I had certain regulations that I would go by. I only talked to 
the general contractor and to his “super” [superintendent] on the job and I only went out to the 
construction areas with the “super” with me. Once in a while I would go out and look around but 
generally the “super” had come with me. Well, they soon knew they had to, you know, I was the 
boss. They didn’t mind. They were great guys. And they’re older and very experienced. So I 
would go to the job site. I would go to the trailer or wherever, and I’d get the “super” and we’d 
go out and look around. Then we’d come back and have the job meeting and these were 
primarily public jobs so there would be me, my assistant—I always had an assistant with me to 
take notes, etcetera, learn—the general contractor, the client rep and then we’d call in some of 
the subcontractors. That was up to the general contractor, I didn’t mess with them. So that was 
my routine and the subs—we’d go around sometimes with them if they were called. Or I would 
say, “Well I’d like to talk to them—see them.” Sometimes it was funny—we were going through
—but I knew them as people, I you know saw them as people, didn’t bother me, you know. Of 
course they cleaned up their act when I was there because one of my aides at another job, he 
said,”Doris, when you leave,” and then Ernie would go around with the client rep and they’d talk 
with the GC. He says, “It sure changes once you leave.” Oh, really? But if someone wants to 
swear, I don’t care. Say what you want to say. Doesn’t bother me. They’re not swearing at me 
and if you are so what, I don’t care. So I had a couple funny experiences. One job we’re walking 
around and the plumber’s coming along and we’re looking at these pipes—and I said, “Oh!”—
they’re copper pipes, and I said,”Oh, those are beautiful. Look at those!” The plumber blushed. 
They were beautiful. But I recognized this guy and he blushed. (laughs)  It was so funny but 
sweet. 
SF: 
And he probably appreciated so much you appreciating his workmanship.  
DC: 
They were so straight, they were perfect and all the hangers were perfectly spaced, you 
know. Of course. So another time, I must say it was really funny. We were going through this 
school that we were renovating, I like to say rejuvenating, this old school, elementary school. 
So it was after the job meeting and I was there and my assistant, this guy, and the client rep, and 
somebody else and we’re looking around at this classroom. I think they had done it as a 
demonstration and so we’re looking at cracks in the ceiling that had been plastered over and the 
colors and so we’re standing there around and all of the sudden we hear these voices on the other 
side of the wall and it was the plasterer with the GC [general contractor] and somebody else. 
Well, it was unbelievable. They were using words  
[01:35:00] 
Doris Cole Interview, November 4, 2019

I’d never even heard of, you know, forget the usual they use in movies now. It was unbelievable. 
And we were all standing there. So I was the only woman in the group and the men in my group 
were standing there transfixed. They didn’t know what to do. Their mouths were open and then 
this group, the plasterer—they were just giving him hell. I knew that they didn’t like this 
plasterer—you know two jobs back they were still washing the dirty laundry from. So they come 
around the corner and they see that we’re there. I just started laughing and smiled and we went 
on with, “Do you really like the peach color?” (laughs) And nobody said anything about the 
conversation. We just—like it had never happened. But I thought it was really funny. And the 
men’s reaction—they were just—they were beyond horrified. They were just transfixed. And 
there were lots of other experiences. 
 
No, I did dress appropriately. I had different outfits that I would wear. I had my nun’s 
outfit. I would dress like a nun in street clothing as they do now, covered totally from neck to 
wrist to ankle—I would have on a medium length skirt, loose fitting jacket. My legs would be 
covered with dark stockings. So most of these—it was a little mean—but most of these 
contractors had been—as children had gone to Catholic schools so they knew the mother 
superior and the teachers—that they were to obey and treat them with respect. So we would do 
that. And then I had another outfit I would wear when they were really aggravating me and I 
wanted a little something—I would show a little leg, still covered totally. But I would wear my 
knee length skirt and when I sat down it was above my knee but I would have black stockings on 
and everything so I would show a little leg to tell them what I wanted them to do. Those are my 
two psychological approaches. Of course when I told a young person that, they were appalled—
(laughs) especially a young man. “Really, you would do that?”  I said, “Well, yes. You know, you 
had to have command.” However, there would be times when, you know, I could see they were 
talking more to my younger male assistant than to me, but we’d nip that in the bud. Yeah, and 
some times they would be helpful to me, sometimes they would give me a little bit of a hard 
time. I just let it go. I’m the architect. I’m in charge. 
SF: 
You owned it. 
DC: 
Yeah, you know, just get over it. And sometimes—not liberties with me—but liberties in 
giving direction or something like that. Well, you know, you gave the direction, you own it. 
However, there would be—sometimes everything will be going along—everybody’s got an 
opinion of what to do—the contractor, the client rep, my dozen engineering consultants—
everybody’s got an opinion of what to do, until there was an issue. I never called them problems
—issue—an issue on the job and then they’d all look at me and say, “Well Doris, you’re the 
architect. What should we do?” (laughs) 
SF: 
And I bet you were ready for that. 
DC.  
I was ready. I didn’t look at them and say, “Well you guys always think 
[01:40:00] 
Doris Cole Interview, November 4, 2019
Women Architects, afc2019/031
22
 you—what should be done, you think that you know what should be done until there’s an issue 
and then you look at me. Hey, I’m just a little lady architect.” No.  
SF: 
What were some of the important career milestones for you? Were there projects—I 
know that certainly the FAIA, but were there certain milestones or goals that you had set for 
yourself? 
DC: 
Well that was nice the FAIA. No, the world changes—times change. My milestones were 
marrying Sergio Barisi and marrying Harold Goyette. And Hal was willing to play game—my 
game, to start an office. And you know he was—nowadays they’d say, he was supportive. He just 
let me do what I wanted to do. It was great, you know.   
SF: 
How did you divide up the responsibilities? You were the—you were—in terms of design 
or… 
DC: 
How we divided up our office—when we first opened our office we both tried working 
on the same projects. That did not work for us. He had his projects; I had my projects. He had his 
clients; I had my clients. We would kibbutz with each other and we ran the office together. Every 
Thursday night we would go out to dinner—someplace nice—and we would go over office 
business. I’d bring my little list with me. He would bring his list or he’d have it in his head and 
we would have a cocktail, we would have a nice dinner and we spent the time discussing 
business. And that’s worked. And then we would send our dinner bill to the office. Let them pay 
for it. And that’s how we were able to run an office in a congenial manner. And of course we 
lived with each other—we saw each other on the weekends but we didn’t really discuss business 
on the weekend. We tried not to. Yeah, we tried not to. And we thought it was important that our 
staff have weekends and that we have weekends. Now of course that didn’t always work out for 
us. We did entertaining and that was pretty much professional related. Sometimes we had to go 
see clients or projects or so forth. But we didn’t make a habit of it. And one of our employees 
who was on salary—he came into the office on weekends to work. And I said,“Well Jason, you 
know you’re not supposed to be doing this. You should have a weekend.” He said, “Well I hope 
you don’t mind but I like to work slowly and so I would prefer to work slowly and come in on 
Sunday afternoon or something. Is that all right?” I said,“Well yes, if that’s what you want to do 
Jason. That’s okay”. So that’s the way we ran it. And we would invite our staff out once each 
summer to our house in Concord - try to be friendly with them, etcetera. 
SF: 
Do you still… 
DC: 
Yes, I still have the house in Concord—spend weekends there. But milestones were 
writing my books, opening my office—obviously that was a huge milestone—and of course 
doing these posters was a huge milestone for me. It really made me think—think about where I’d 
come from, where I was going. Of course right now it’s so busy doing architecture—and doing 
these projects that I have. I haven’t as you can see—I haven’t gotten back—I have three posters 
up there. One of the reasons I did the posters was because people asked me, “When are you 
Doris Cole Interview, November 4, 2019
Women Architects, afc2019/031
23
going to do another book, Doris?” I thought about it—I didn’t really feel like it and so I felt—
posters—I wanted to combine 
[01:45:00] 
 the visual with the text and that’s what I’ve been able to do. I do the little watercolors, small 
(getting out watercolors) and then I blow them up in my computer—Photoshop. The series I did 
of three—three different seasons and I like geometric forms so I’m really concentrating on 
geometric forms. Not this one that you see with clouds but the others—well that was cleaning 
out my paintbox when I thought I’d not do more but I of course I went ahead and did more. And 
more geometric forms and these are ones I’ve done over a period of time so I like lines and 
circles and triangles—all that kind of good stuff. So I’ll get back to it, hopefully when I finish up 
some of the projects I’m doing now. So they’re various milestones. Yes, I guess all of these 
various things that I’ve gone through, that I didn’t realize were milestones at the time—going to 
Radcliffe instead of Pembroke, going to the GSD—toughening it out, graduating from the GSD, 
going to France, working here in Cambridge. I made a conscious decision that I would live and 
work one place and then travel other places. There are many architects who do this traveling bit 
by working in various offices but I didn’t find that was for me. I thought I wanted to have 
professional roots and then I would travel. So I didn’t organize my life that way. Working at MIT 
was a milestone, opening up our office was a milestone, closing our office was a milestone, 
doing the Commentary Posters, writing all of my books definitely were several and being here 
with you is a milestone. So here we go. 
SF: 
How about your legacy—what do you see as your legacy? 
DC: 
It’s whatever people want it to be. You know, you often read about people—I was just 
reading—I’m taking a course on the early Renaissance, okay and not to compare myself to 
Petrarch, Petracha, okay. People find that his legacy are all the sonnets he wrote to this 
mysterious woman, Laura. And he they call, the Father of the Sonnet. Well, that’s not what he 
thought his legacy was going to be and that’s not what he tried for. He wrote many other things 
very serious and that’s what he thought his legacy was going to be so I don’t look at it as a 
legacy really. But I am pleased that I was active in the 1970s and wrote my Tipi book and it has 
been noted several places and by someone who’s doing their PhD on the 1970s women 
architects, saying that doing academic research can be a way of protesting, of adding to the 
women’s movement so I’m pleased she saw it that way cuz it was that way. You know, when he 
asked me, “What are you doing here Doris?” What do you mean, what am I doing here? I 
answered that question and I was glad that I was able to answer for myself and for others. My 
buildings that I’ve done—there are some I’ve liked—some I haven’t liked. Some renovations 
I’ve done and I’ve renovated my renovations. So buildings I suppose are like children,  
[01:50:00] 
Doris Cole Interview, November 4, 2019
Women Architects, afc2019/031
24
you have favorites but you keep it a secret. Doing the building at Tim Anderson’s office—the 
really, the preliminary design for that—that’s one of my favorites, I must say. And then working 
with Sergio on our house in Concord—that’s one of my favorites. And then the other one that is
—would be a series of favorites, would be of all the renovations-rejuvenations that I did in the 
City of Boston, working in the neighborhoods, at their historic schools. I did that primarily under 
Mayor [Ray] Flynn but also under Mayor [Thomas M.] Menino and partly that was done because 
of the court order of integrating the schools in Boston. Well, fortunately they couldn’t afford to 
build all new ones, so part of that was to bring back to life these schools and that really helped 
the legacy of the Boston schools and how they were originally designed and the school 
department way back then, in the early 1900s, late 1800s, and the early 1900s. These schools 
didn’t just appear. They had like whole pattern books that the school department had designed. 
They had a typical laboratories, typical classrooms, typical science labs that they had developed 
in the school department. And actually when I worked for Drummy Roseane Anderson, Drummy 
had worked in Boston, in the school department. So I met him a couple of times. He was quite 
old at that point when I worked there. But he came through the office once or twice so that his 
young people, so called young people, could show him that they were taking good care of his 
legacy. So that I—was really very interesting. Of course some of those schools in Boston they 
have torn down but a lot they have not. Some of them they have renovated further. Some they’ve 
added on to. Actually we did additions to some of them which is always sort of fun to do but I 
think that was a way of approaching designing schools, programming them and designing them, 
was a very important part that perhaps many people have lost now. Also, I might note that over 
the years Boston schools have become larger and larger and larger and now they are spending on 
one school maybe $54 million dollars. Are these kids learning more? I’m not sure. I remember 
going through one school with somebody from the school department. We both agreed, yeah you 
can renovate and rebuild but if you don’t do your homework (coughs)—if you don’t do your 
homework, you’re not going to learn. 
DC: 
Are there anymore questions? 
SF: 
I just have—is there anything that you wish you had known when you started that you 
know now if you had to go back and advise—give advice to a young architect? 
DC: 
Oh well, I think I would have been more direct, more aware of what I was doing I hope.  
For example, it’s really important what types of offices young architects work in.  
[01:55:00] 
For example, if you’re interested in medical facilities, it’s a good idea to work in a firm that does 
medical facilities. I happened to—well I worked at offices that did a variety of things but the 
largest projects or some of the important projects that DRA did—I was there a long time—were 
academic projects in schools, so I learned about that. Well, I had done public housing but I think 
I would have been more mindful about what I was doing. Would it have mattered? I don’t know. 
But you can’t always be mindful about what you are doing because the world doesn’t always let 
Doris Cole Interview, November 4, 2019

25
you be that way. Things come along— rocks are placed in your path, mountains you have to 
climb, etcetera, etcetera. Now if I was starting out today, I’m not sure I would go into 
architecture. I think very interesting the—and this would have come out of product design—the 
things that are being designed, and mechanical things like arms that move, and all of these kinds 
of contraptions. No, I would have had to have concentrated and really gotten more of a handle on 
mathematics because I have gone back and done some of these classes you can get on-line or at 
the library. And you know, they really lose me in the math so I don’t really know if I’d have done 
that. But looking back that was my path, wasn’t it. My father was in buildings. My mother—well 
I suppose I could have gone on the stage—but she was interested in things visual even though 
she was legally blind from birth. So that was sort of interesting and that was something 
interesting to grow up with. She said she thought it was always easier for her than other people 
that became legally blind because she was that way from birth so she had to learn how to get 
along with it. But that certainly made me see things differently so when I look back it was sort of 
a natural that I would become an architect or something to do with the built environment. So I’m 
glad I did. I’ve always found it interesting.  I’ve looked at it as a interest that was multi-faceted. 
So that was good for me because having gone to Radcliffe, I was a little bit academic. So writing 
books helped me in that respect and I have been able to at least expand in my life and in my 
mind and how I approached architecture. And that was good. One of the things that might have 
been quite different was because—I wrote books because people asked me questions and I had 
nobody to talk to. So even when I had my own office, I would go home and that’s partly why I 
wrote the books because these women were my mentors. And I would go home and talk to 
myself and essentially talk to them. First I had to find out what was architecture but then from 
Eleanor Raymond—she was a very good architect, very inventive—she did the first solar house 
and on and on. Amelia Peabody was her patron. So from Eleanor, I talked with her in my mind 
although I knew her personally. She was my mentor and my friend but she—and when we talked 
together, we only talked about architecture together—I learned about design.  
[02:00:00] 
And then I wrote the book about Howe, Manning and Almy. I learned from them how to run a 
practice—how to do that. So I could look at them, how they did this, not all their buildings I 
thought were so great. They were quite conservative in their design though Manning was less so. 
So I learned how to run an office from them. And then of course my School Treasures, which 
was not about women, I learned how—more about schools and education. And doing things in 
education probably also suited me too because my sister was a professor and she was obviously 
academic so I had sort of that along side me. Yeah, okay, so that was that.  
SF:  
Thank you. You have been so generous with your time. 
DC: 
Well, thank you for coming here, to come all the way to Cambridge.  
SF: 
Yes, Cambridge, not Boston.

Yes, across the river. And to let me do this with you. And of course it’s a great honor to 
think that this will be in the Library of Congress. That’s really quite special.
