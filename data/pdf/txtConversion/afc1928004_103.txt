THE GRECIAN BEND 
SaW my lovely Angelina, 
Going down Piccadilly to-day, 
When I 
saw her lovely features, 
How it set my heart a heating away ; 
She was dress d 
so neat, she looted so sweet, 
Walking with a 
lady friend, 
how I 
lathOted when I 
saw her 
Trying to do the Greciau bend. 
CLIOLIUS. 
The Grecian bend, tow go it, ladies, 
Shake yourself, and set us crazy, 
Double up and show the men, 
The style is now the Grecian bend. 
Her back it look'd just like a 
camel's, 
_tem_ was n 
Because her head 
her feet, 
Like a 
mail NVIIP11 he is hard up, 
Trying to make both ends meet ; 
Such pretty feet aid tassels neat, 
And of hair there was no end, 
I 
haul to laugh \\lien I 
saw her, 
Trying to do the Grecian Bend. 
The Greetaa Bend, & c.' 
I 
followed after Angelina, 
Not thinking what woula be the end, 
The boys they shouted as she passed them, 
" 
Miss, I'll have your Grecian bend I" 
When a 
fellow like me on a 
yeloclpede, 
s weight about twelve stone ten, 
Ran slap against my Angelina, 
And away went her Grecian Bend. 
The Grecian Bend, lac. 
I 
rushed to rescue Angelina, 
But not before it was too late, 
There she. lay upon the sidewalk, 
Oh ! in such a 
dre.olful state ; 
I 
said, " my dear, your lover's here I" 
She shouted out, " ! hang the men 
See, he's been and gone and done it, 
And I've lost my Grecian bend."

I NEVER SAY NO. 
W ords and Music by ERNEE CLARKE. 
Tb ore are many whose weakness I 
know, 
Oft leads them from ninny good things, 
But I'm of the contrftry sort, 
And I 
find a good turn it oft brings. 
I'm not over bashful you see, 
And I 
make it a point where I 
go, 
To let others refuse it if they please, 
But this child—he never says no ! 
Cuortus.—So T 
give you the hint, if you want to get on, 
Wherever you happen to go ; 
If others choose, why let them refuse, 
But with you, mind, never say no 
N ow it happeiH, perhaps, once in a 
life, 
That a iriend or relation may say 
Well, Charles, I 
can do you a 
turn, 
It happens to be in my sway. 
What a donkey, you all will adroit, 
A fellow would be now to go; 
And bash fitly beg to decline. 
I 
wouldn't— I 
never say no. [Sc I 
give, & e. 
I 
happened to drop in a 
Pub, 
A id dropped on a friend the same time ; 
-Who had dropped on another or two, 
And wished them to stay and take wine,. 
'Twas sickening to hear them refuse, 
'
Twit, chart , 
he prop _ii 
o, 
e to them, so 
I 
thought it high time, so I 
said. 
Here I 
never say no. [ So I 
give, & c. 
You mustn't be over particular. 
If von want to get on well thro' life, 
I 
studied the rule that I 
mention, 
When I 
was in search of a 
wife. 
I was first introduced to an heires, 
With heaps of the requisite ; so 
Tw ai a •ti L,:l it 
bet ween features and pocket, 
She was forty, bt I 
didn't say no. [ So I 
give, & c. 
Now I 
hope no one misunderstands me, 
Or thinks I do0 t mean what I 
say ; 
If such be the ease, for the moment, 
Undeceive yourselves quickly, I 
pray. 
You can try just by way of example, 
A cigar, or a 
stiff Lrandy go; 
Or anyt.,ing else I 
might fancy. 
And you'll find I never say no. [ So I 
give, &c.

Just what a 
soldier could be. 
While walking din; the park, I 
hear the girls remark, 
What a 
gentleman that officer must be, 
For while I 
cut a_dash, with may sword and silken sash, 
I 
feel that their remarks are upon me. 
I 
took may love's advice, & c. 
If a 
private I 
should meet while walking thro' the street, 
Of course I 
take good care that he sees ine. 
And knowing well his duty, of course he does salute me, 
Which is very gratifying to me. 
I 
took my love's advice, d:c. 
I 
am no carpet knight, I 
wear no feather white, 
A soldier brave alone you'll find in me, 
Should occasion but require my attendance under fire, 
You'll find me where a 
soldier should be. 
I 
took my love's advice, dic. 
At ball or fetes and routs, I 
know my way about, 
At each an ornament I 
be, 
must bid an revoir to- night for I 
am called to fight, 
Not with swords—but for muffins and for tea. 
I 
took my love's advice, &e. 
Let our country's daughters' beauty, 
Raise every man to duty. 
In action or wherever he may be. 
In these times of rumored wars, let them swell the rival corps, 
And be men and soldiers like me. 
I 
took my love's advice, dtc.

was passing the door so just dropped in, 
Having nothing my time to engage; 
And secin! , they Welty short of some one to sing, 
I've ma E(

You can see that there's nothing like pride about me, 
My clothes didn't cost many mags ; 
Who I 
am, what's my name, veil I 
haven't a 
card, 
So in visper, it's Timothy Baggs 
CHORUS. 
Then how do you do, and bow do yon don't 7 
Excuse iny tatters and rags ; 
Don't turn up your nose with disdain, 
At Timothy \Wain B.g,ti. 
The Prince of Wales he heard of me, 
He wrote and said '• (Ad pal; 
Be sure you come to my house to tea, 
And mind you bring the old Gal!' 
I 
took Mrs. Bag .s. and all the young Boggs, 
Like me they dress vell in rags ; 
The Prince and PrinCeSA WaS Ilelighted to tea, 
With Mistress and Mr. Baggs. 
Then how do you do, & c. 
Very soon you'll see the big ships sail, 
With thousands of working. men ; 
The limigratioa Scheme my friends, 
Pm working it all right for them. 
For I

Lord G--a 
few days ago, 
lie Sala, " set London Boating with flags ; 
Here's t 
N't3 postage stamps towards the expense, 
Put the rest to it, Timothy Boggs. 
Then how do you do, & c. 
The Casual Wards they don't suit me, 
To the per they are awfully severe; 
When I 
pays 'em a 
visit I 
eats and drinks, 
And sleeps with the Overseer. 
They find me in bacco, they find me in beer, 
And these are their left off rags; 
They never looked. well on them Guardians,_ 
But they do on Villiam Baggs. 
Then how do you do, &c. 
The ladies, the dears, are all fond of Baggs, 
And my Wif13 is jealous of me ; 
If ever I 
only goes (lilt for a 
stroll, 
My Missos she follows to see ; 
If I 
only acknowledge a 
few in the street, 
When I 
gets home she commences her nags ; 
I 
puts on my hat and my coat, and I 
says, 
Good evening, sweet Mistress Baggs! 
Then how do you do, & c. 
TOM BROWN'S DILEMMA. 
Toni Brown was a 
hatter, a 
regular brick, 
AV110 just for a 
trifle was ne'er known to stick ; 
lie was fond of a 
pipe and a 
good looking lass, • 
And if truth must be told, far too fond of a 
glass ; 
So in a 
short song I 
intend to relate 
How Tom catne to enter the conjugal state, 
And the moral is wrong I 
must certainly think, 
For Tom got a 
wife thro' exceeding his drink. 
Now, Thomas one night had been out on the loose, 
he'd taken the chair at the Gridiron and Goose, 
And about one o'clock he turned out in the street, 
'Well, not in a 
state for a 
lady to meet. 
For his gait was unsteady, his voice very thick, 
And he had to walk home far as Hackney Wick, 
Number 6 
in , Sun Terrace was Tom Brown's address, 
And he readied that locale in a 
plague of a 
mess. 
He arrived at the Terrace at a 
quarter to four, 
And saw No. 6 
phinly marked on the door, 
By a 
polished brass letter he'd ordered that day, 
So he opened the, door and went in right away. 
lie entered the bed-room and thinking all right, 
Began strikine• a 
match his candle to light; 
When a 
horrible scream raised the hair on his head, 
And on turning he noticed a 
lady in bed. 
Tom rushed from the room like a 
terrified mouse, 
Then into the street and looked up at the house ; 
When sobered by fright he said " Must be ! it is I" 
And saw for the first time the house wasn't 
Then just to make certain he thought that once more, 
he'd examine the brass fie•nre 6 
on the docr, 
When he saw— but there as I \\I:ill to be tersp, 
What he saw l'll relate in the forthcoming v'erse. 
Miss Jones lived at 9, just 3 
doors from Broun, 
But the 9 
had a 
screw loose and turned up side down, 
So it looked like a 
six, and you'll own this will make, 
A first class excuse for.Tom Brown's mistake. 
Tom thowtht so and saw her, explained and she cried, 
From the house he mistook he the miss took as bride ; 
Still the 9 
and the 6 
in the family runs, 
For they've 9 
blooming daughters, and 6 
grown up sons

THE HUNGRY ARMY. 
When I 
was young and in my prime, 
I 
thought I'd go and join the line, 
.And as a 
soldier cut it shine, 
In a 
lot called the Hungry Army. 
Said the sergeant you are just the chap, 
And placed a 
knapsack on my back, 
They sent me off to Ballarat, 
To fight in the Hungry Army. 
CHORUS. 
Sound the bugle, blow the horn, 
Fight for glory night and morn, 
Hungry soldiers, ragged and torn, 
Just returned from the army. 
March, boys, march, the way is on before us, 
Shout, boys, shout., and join us in the chorus, 
March, boys, march, the foe is still advancing, 
Cheer, boys, cheer, for the new and happy laud. 
I 
went to drill on one fine day. 
The wind was rather strong that way. 
It fact it blew its all away, 
This glorious hungry army. 
I've got a 
medal as you see, 
The workhouse presented it to me, 
For hanging to a 
rotten tree, 
When the wind took the hungry army. 
Then sound the bugle, &c. 
They cut my hair with a 
knife and fork, 
And curled it with a 
cabbage stalk, 
And fed inc on some cabbage broth, 
To figlit in the hungry army. 
They served it out in a 
large tin can, 
A teaspoonini to every nean, 
.rot so fai 
could'nt stand., 
1717o fight, in the hungry army 
Then sound the bugle, & c. 
They sent me out to drill recruits, 
But they kicked me with their hobnailed boots; 
Oh, take! oh, take away these brutes, 
Of this elorious hungry army. 
Nov kind friends I 
must be off. 
I 
think I 
smell the mutton broth, 
Here comes Generals Howl and Scoff, 
The heads of the hungry army. 
Then sound the bugle, dr.c. 
THE SEPARATION. 
Oh, love, they say that we must part, 
Since both are anxious to be free; 
And I 
will give von back 
our heart 
If you will give mine back to me. 
You know the day when we first met, 
Those promises that you made to me; 
While I 
those promises have kept, 
And you have proven false to me. 
And then the second day we met, 
You looked and smiled so sweet on me; 
That day I 
know I'll ne'er forget, 
When tlfat sweet kiss I 
gave to thee. 
Now, love, I'll bid you a 
farewell, 
Since both are anxious to be free; 
And now 
send you home your heart, 
if you will send mine back to me.

THE VOICE OF SPRING 
I 
come, I 
come, ye have called me long, 
I 
come o'er the mountain with light and song; 
Ye may trace my slops o'er the waking earth. 
By the winds which tell of the violets birth. 
The fisher is out on the sunny sea, 
And the reindeer bounds flirt; the pasture free; 
While the pine has a 
fringe of soltcr green, 
And the moss looks bright where my step has been. 
From the streams and founts I 
have loosed the chain; 
They are sweeping on to the silv'ry main, 
They are flashing from the mountain brow, 
They are flinging spray on the forest bough. 
Come forth, 0 Ye children of gladness come! 
-Where the violets lie may now be your home; 
-With the lyre and the wreath and the joyous lay, 
Come forth to the sunshine I 
may not stay. 
For me I 
depart to a 
brighter shore, 
Ye are marked w th care, ye are mine no more; 
I 
go where the loved who have left 
on dwell. 
And the fluw'rs are not Death's, fare ye well, farewell. 
THE WILLOW SONG. 
[Sung by the Great Tragedienne, Miss M ARY McVicKEtt, in "Othello," 
at Booth's Theatre.] 
The poor soul sat sighing by a 
sycamore tree, 
Sing all a 
green willow ; 
Her band on her bosom, her head on her knee, 
Sing willow, willow, willow, willow; 
The fresh streams ran by her and taut- inured her moans, 
Sing willow, willow, sing willow, willow ; 
Iler salt tears fell front her and r,•oitened the stones, 
Sing willow, willow, willow, willow ; 
Sing all the g-r 
en willow must be my garland, 
Let nobody blame him, his 6C.)111 I 
approve. 
SrOKEN.—Nay, that's not next. 
Bark ! who is it that knocks? 
It is the wind. 
I 
called my love false, but what said he then ? 
Sing willow, willow, willow, willow, sing willow, sing willow, 
willow. 
What will I 
do without thee, 
Whom I 
ever hold so dear, 
I 
will lead a 
life or sorrow, 
That is born of hope and fear. 
I 
have never learnel to doubt thee, 
I 
will trust thee, as of yore : 
But I 
know that some have parted, 
And have loved not as before. 
CHORUS. 
What will I 
do without thee, 
Whom I 
ever hold so dear ? 
I 
will lead, a 
life of sorrow, . 
That is born of hope and fear. 
What will I 
do without thee, 
In the holy summer eves, 
Or, when sweet and pensive autumn, 
Paints the sere upon the leaves. 
When the clouds of woe have gathered, 
And my grief's beyond control, 
Tell me :—who will prove as sun light, 
And as music to my soul. 
What will, tta. 
What will I 
do without thee, 
Thus I 
a,k me, day by day: 
Yet I 
know a 
gloom will gather, 
On my heart when ycu're away, 
But when other scenes and pleasures, 
Be tr their tender hearts from me, 
Oh ! recall that pure affection, 
Shave ever had for thee. 
What will, &e.

WHEN YOU'RE MARRIED YOU'LL FIND IT OUT. 
I 
am a married nin-compoop, 
You call tell by half a

A single man I 
ti Ii e

If I 
could get a 
chance. 
But when a 
man gets married, 
Its all U P with hint ; 
It's the sort of thing ladies like, 
To take us fellows in, 
CHORUS. 
Then, oh, dear, oh 
Lead a 
single MC ; 
A man he is a 
nin-com-poop, 
That takes himself a 
wife. 
Then, oh, dear, oh, 
Be F

Let ladies try, but pipe your eye, 
When you're married, you'll had it out. 
A 
fellow he gets spooney 
On a 
girl that looks a 
queen, 
If he don't propose in a 
fortnight, 
She asks him what he means; 
lull must quickly marry me; 
She knows her way about, 
lie don't— he's green— he marries her, 
And then he finds it out. 
Then, oh, dear, oh, &0. 
Ile takes his love down by the sea, 
To spend the honey 1110011 ; 
'What should be honey, 
Always turns to cream of tartar soon. 
It's dear, oh, dnekey ! oh, darling! 
For a 
week or thereabout ; 
And then she makes it warm for him ; 
When you're married, you'll find it out. 
Then, oh, dear, oh, &o. 
Ile once was stout and hearty, 
But now like mime he's thin ; 
Perhaps his wife is tolerable, 
Perhaps she's fond of gin. 
I 
won't say which, but somehow 
Ills money it dies about, 
Till his uncle has to help him ; 
It's then he finds it out. 
Then, oh, dear, oh! & c. 
Then in half a 
dozen years, 
Around your table there ; 
Ton count a 
dozen boys and girls, 
All yours— it makes you stare. 
If they ain't, you have to keep the lot, 
Perhaps you've got the gout; 
The boys won't work, the girls don't want, 
When you're married, you'll find it out.

IF I'D ONLY BEEN A FISHL 
One lovely morn I 
took a

ue'er can; 
It's been the cause of all my woe, 
My sorrow, grief and pain,

If I'd only been a

At the bottom of the deep blue sea—Oh ! lor I. 
The day was fine, I 
thought a 
sail, 
Would please my charming mate, 
So I 
hired a 
boat, and out we went, 
It proved, alas! her fate. 
She tried her hand at rowing, 
And her body forward bent, 
She gave a 
pull, but caught a

And overboard she went—Ohl lor! 
If I'd only been a

She first bobbed' down, and then bobbed up,

JUST AS WE PLEASE. 
Now, ladies, pray hear me, I 
come here to cheer me, 
So please pay attention and list to my lay; 
If the song I 
now sing does happen to bring 
To your faces a 
smile, ' twill my efforts repay. 
The subject I've chosen for your approbation,

lie's been head of the firm ever since the creation. 
We ladies can wheedle him just as we please.

Yet, oh! can't we tease, bring him on his knees, 
We can coax, vex, torment, perplex, just as we please: 
When first lid comes wooing, our hand and heart "tieing, 
His eye with truth beaming, shines out like a 
star; 
I 
fancy I 
hear him his suit meekly pleading, 
For, in love he's a 
lamb, tho' a 
lion in war. 
And should we say " yes," his delight's measure, 
Oh! the vows he will make, and your hand fondly seize; 
Should you ask for the moon, he would climb for the treasure, 
We ladies can wheedle him just as we please! 
Yet, eh I 
can't we tease, Jec, 
Too long you have tarried, he'll say, let's get married, 
And blushing you tell him he may name the day; 
Before perhaps, he sad is, but then he half mad is, 
To think that at last he has got his own way. 
And when to the church with biro you are going, 
He's radiant with smiles as your arm he will squeeze; 
lie thinks that for life, dear, you'll soon be my wife, dear,' 
And then, Madam, you can do just as you please. 
Yet, oh ! can't we tease, &c. 
Sometimes he will bluster, and make a 
great fluster, 
When boldly you ask for four or five pounds; 
The house he is storming, from night until morning, 
Why, a 
bankrupt, madam, I 
soon shall be found. 
But when after dinner, his sweet cigar smoking, 
You wait, and the first opportnnily seize; 
To kiss him and say: dear, I 
was only joking, 
He'll give as much money then as you please. 
Yet, oh! can't we tease, erz. 
We must not revile at, but pleasantly smile at 
The petty annoyances that may occur; 
Our duties never fearing, say all that's endearing, 
Bear patiently with him without a 
demur. 
And if he is snarling, just call hint a 
darling, 
And very soon it will his anger appease; 
Just pat his cheek kindly, he'll follow blindly, 
- in fact you can do with him just as you please. 
Yet, oh! Can't we tease. ka,

And in bad spirits, rather ; 
Boys, if you tell me where she is

Have you seen her chignon made of artificial hair;

She's up to all accomplishments,. 
To hops she likes to go, 
And, oh, my ? can't she trip 
Upon the light fantastic toe I 
She wears a 
mantle, dress, and shawl, 
That cost a 
dollar complete, 
And sports the new Flexura boot, 
They sell in Fulton street.. 
I

She borrowed fifty dollars from me, 
The last time that we met: 
It is'ut that I 
care about, 
I 
only want my pet. 
I'd throw myself into her arms, 
If her I

I 
am a 
sprightly .sort of chap, 
As you can plainly see, 
Though hopping, skipping all the day, 
It never tires me; 
For on the day that I 
was born, 
I 
made the people roar, 
Ijumped clean off the nurse's knee, 
And tumbled on the floor. 
CHORUS. 
I 
tumble up, I 
tumble down. 
A chap that never t

By all the boys throughout the town, 
called the Cove on wires. 
And as I 
grew advanced in years, 
At school I 
couldn't stop, 
Because my tumbling tricks would 
Always make me play the hop: 
But in all kinds of running games, 
l'd take them by surprise, 
At football. through my kicking powers, 
I 
always won the prize. 
I

At last I 
thought I'd married get, 
So tried to find a

And soon I

To jog along through life ;

could jump before I 
wed, 
As some of you have seen, 
But if you saw me sometimes now, 
You'd think I 
went by steam.

When we were wed, my wife and I, 
Stuck to our w, ,rk like In icks, 
And. now I

THE LEAP FOR LIFE: 
OR THE FLYING LADY 
Written by J. LLOYD. 
Sensations we find now are always the go, 
At least I've found so to my cost 
For all through the last one, you may as well know;. 
A once loving sweetheart lye lost. 
We once were as happy as happy could be, 
Had no cause for trouble or strife 
UntiII Mary Jones fancied she could perform, 
On the Trapeze the Leap for Life. 
Spoken.—Yes, ladies and gentlemen I 
can assure youthat— 
The leap for lire has caused this strife, 
And made my prospects shady, 
Far dearer than I 
loved my life 
I 
loved that flying lady.. 
We all went on right until fate interfered, 
And Mary Jones happened to meet 
A tumbler, whose real name was simply John Brown', 
While slanging one day in the street ; 
His form so attractive, his figure so neat, 
So unlike common buskers was he, 
So pleasing his tricks she enchanted became, 
Aud soon forgot all about me. 
The Leap for Life has caused, dr.c 
They thus got acquainted and to my dismay 
To his house she would often go round, 
And as this said acrobat soon got a 
shop, 
At the halt she could nightly be found. 
She of his performance \Nes doatingly fond,. 
And' promised to be his dear wiltr 
If he only would in return bring her out 
And teach her the Leap for Life. 
The Leap for Life has caused, cEc.,. 
Of course he consented. and soon after that 
I 
went to a 
hall but my rage 
I 
could scarcely co,itain when Mary and he 
Tofeether came on to the stage. 
He'd christened himself by some grand foreign name, 
And she who so cruel had been 
Instead of plain Miss Mary Jones now was called 
The beautiful Etnerahline.

TOM'S FATHER. 
OR, VIE YOUNG MAN OF TliF: PERIOD. 
The chaff about the Girls, of this 
Fast period, is past, 
In fact I 
thowsht the fun was 
Getting much too thick to last ! 
But now you'll find the subject changed 
If you the papers scan, 
Instead of taking off the Girls, 
They chaff our " Fast young Man." 
Cuostus.—The young men of the present day 
They go the pace—yes rather. 
But who the piper has to pay, 
You'd better ask Tom's father. 
They visit Music halls, of course, 
Casinos, balls as well, 
Wear patent leather boots, and tights, 
And come the heavy swell. 
In strong cigars of course indulge. 
At pool and billiards play, 
And drink like little fishes, 
Can these " Young Men of the day." 
The young men, dre. 
They stay indoors when they have drained 
Their pockets to the dregs, 
Beneath their Dad's " mahogrrny " 
Then often " kick their legs," 
They never take their sisters out 
It's such a 
bore they vow, 
One really cannot tell to what 
Young men are corning now. 
The young men, dr.c. 
Sometimes they do " the opera," 
And crone out rather grand, 
Of course an Omnibus is slow, 
A cab call from the stand; 
Young ladies are discarded, 
For they're too much trouble, they say, 
And marriarre ne'er is thought of 
By the '• Young Men of the day." 
The young men, ((Lc. 
But when a 
fellow's young, why 
He's of course on pleasure bent, 
And though he may be rather gay, 
No harm is really meant. 
Young folks must sow their wild oats, 
Or at least as people say, 
And we'll hope for reformation, 
In our " Young Men of the day.' (The young men, ttc. 
I've only just arrived in town, 
To see von all I've just come down, 
And now myself I'd best make known, 
Though who I 
am is clearly shown. 
My walk and figure understand, 
All show I'm some one rather grand; 
And all the people know me well, 
For I'm the dashing West End Swell. 
CHORUS. 
As gaily through the streets I 
roam, 
here'er I 
go I'm always known, 
The folks that see me know me well, 
For I'm the dashing West End Swell. 
At morning in my carriage fine, , 
Around the Park I 
cut a 
shine, 
And all will clear the way quite fast, 
To let my grand turn out go past; 
My pair of greys the folks astound, 
As I 
go driving round and round, 
And to each other people tell, 
That l'm the dashing West End Swell. 
As gaily through, &e. 
At Balls or Routs I'm all the go, 
For none come up to me you know, 
They say my dancing's quite A

In fact I'm excelled by none ; 
The best of partners I 
engage, 
in fact I'm always quite the rage, 
The ladies like my dancing well, 
For I'm the dashing West End Swell. 
As gaily through, &c. 
The Derby races I 
attend, 
'With four in hand my way I 
wend,' 
Postillions in my front and rear, 
To always keep a 
passage clear; 
To get a

I 
in the grand stand take my place, 
The winner I 
can always tell. 
For I'm the dashing West End Swell.

WHO WOULD BE A NUN? 
"Written by J. LLOYD. 
The interest of the public, now, 
Is turned on Convent life, 
Becau,e 
between the sisterhood, 
There's been a 
little strife ; 
And by this means their little tricks, 
Have all been brought to view, 
We've heard some strange reports of late, 
We now know what they do. 
CHORUS. 
We've found the Convent secrets out, 
To light thsy all have come, 
And after what we've lately heard, 
Pray who would be a 
Nun ? 
They musn't speak without consent, 
Too early musn't rise, 
Should never look for birds nests no, 
Nor eat gooseberry pies ; 
But have to live on mutton, 
When they get it though, I 
mean. 
They must not speak at meal times, 
Nor eat strawberries and cream.

Or trifles slight as these, 
She'll have to clean and scrub the floor,

No one must sew unless they've leave, 
And though there seems no harm. 
Must not attempt to mend their clothes, 
Or try and make them warm ; 
They must- not speak of sweethearts, 
That would scare the others wits, 
And if one thought of marriage. 
They would all go into fits. 
We've found, & c. 
The pantry's not the place to eat, 
If they're inclined to sup, 
And in their private dining room, 
They musn't have it up; 
The counting house nor kitchen, 
Though the fact seems rather funny, 
But in the parlor where it's proved, 
The Queen ate bread and honey, 
We've found, &c. 
And should we ask a 
Monk to sup, 
The charge would make you stare, 
It even proved a 
greater crime, 
Than sitting on a 
chair ; 
In fact their customs are so strange, 
They take you by surprise, 
This may be called religion, 
But I 
can't see where it lies.

That's the dashing little widow Sarah Brown.

No, let them have their way, no matter what they say, 
I'm the dashing little widow Sarah Brown. 
It was only last Friday as I 
went down to the park 
To witness the great ascension, 
I 
wore my Grecian bend, and while walking with a 
friend, 
I 
saw I 
attracted great attention. 
The girls stared, and men would smile. 
As we were strolling round, 
I'd plainly bear them say, as we pass'd them on the way, 
That's the dashing little widow Sarah Brown. 
Oh my, &e. 
And now I'm going to leave you, but I 
hope to meet again, 
And see your smiles once more, 
I'd love to sing for :von, but it's really getting late, 
I've left no one to close my little store. 
But one request More I 
go, 
Is let your hands resound, 
It always gives me pride, when I 
know your satisfied, 
With the dashing little widow Sarah Brown. 
Oh I

THE CHAP WOT PLAYS THE CORNET. 
A beauteous girl I 
once adored, was smitten by her grace, 
She was a 
screamer, on my word, :. nd lived in Ashland Place. 
For months and months I 
followed her, then mustered pluck to speak, 
And I 
didn't quite forget the smile she gave for many a 
week. 
CHO 
lt US-
I 
offered her my heart, but she to shreds has torn it, 
Because I 
couldn't tootle, tootle, too, upon the cornet. 
She told tee to a 
party she was going that very night, 
Near Union Square. 
I 
thereupon requested that I 
might 
Her escort be. 
To this she made excuses not a 
few, 
When I 
at once made up my mind to " Union Square" it too. 
I 
offered her, &e. 
I 
soon found out the mansion, and I 
heard there was a 
ball, 
And having bribed the servant, took a 
step into the hall. 
There was cat-gut scrapers going in, with fifes, and drums, and bases; 
But it's very strange how circumstances sometimes alter cases. 
I 
offered her, & c. 
The chap wot played the cornet came. and stopped outside the door, 
Until my charmer came—but he and she had met before. 
Then round the square they strolled ( such artfulness, I 
scorn it,) 
For presently I 
saw her kiss the chap wot played the cornet. 
I 
offered her, &c. 
Half frenzied with despair, I 
hurried from the spot, 
And beating hard my breast-es- es, bewailed my wretched lot. 
Next morning, fell of aches and pains, as if stung by a 
hornet, 
To Dodworth's straight I 
made my way, and bought a 
silver cornet. 
I 
offered her, &c. 
But cash and practice wasted are—her love I 
cannot gain, 
I 
cannot get a •• lip," and so I 
spend my breath in vain. 
She means to marry the cornet, so if I 
may be so bold, 
Why blow the cornet chap, I 
say; I'm bowed if I 
ain't sold. 
I 
offered her, Sze.

DA-DA, OR FIFTH AVENUE BELLE, 
Now I 
will tell of a 
charming belle, 
As sweet as muscatelle, 
And the truth I'll tell. 
This maiden's name was Nell, 
With her father she did dwell, 
It) a 
mansion in Fifth Avenue. 
We met one day in Central Park, 
She looked so neat and dressed so smart, 
She really looked up to the mark, 
And was along with Da-da. 
CLIORUS. 
Da-da, Da-da, Da-da, 
I 
cougli'd and smiled and sigh'd in vain, 
Some opportunity to gain, 
To speak to her, when her Pa came, 
And most insulted me. 
Said he, " Sir, I 
don't understand, 
Your conduct, I 
must reprimand." 
When Nelly pressed the old gent's baud, 
Saying " don't be cross, Da-da." 
Da-da, 
The old gent tottered in his shoes, 
Said she, " Now Pe, you won't refuse, 
You know you have this gent abused, 
Apologise to him." 
Said be, " I 
very sorry am, 
If I've insulted this young man. 
Invite him home to dine, you can," 
Said she, " dear Da-da." 
She then invited me to dine; 
We both shook hands and then took wino, 
Said I, " My pet, will you be mine?" 
Said she, " you ask Da-da." 
I 
gained her Pa's consent that day, 
The very next took her away. 
Now to our joy we've got a 
buy, 
Who calls me his Da-da.

DARLING LITTLE SOPHIE. 
Tripping through the wild wood. 
On a 
summer's city, 
Darling little Sophie 
Always pas:-ed. that way 
To school, homeward wending, 
O'er Lill and dale so bright, 
My heart was ever beating 
For this angel of light.

Blithsome little Sophie 
Lovely is and mild, 
My heart is ever with thee, 
Nature's happy chill 
Flowers of the morning, 
Petals open wide, 
Looking so resplendent, 
Sophie with them vied. 
Spring and summer bloom'd and past, 
Her heart was liht and free, 
And autumn with its dreary blast, 
IsTe'er made a 
change in thee. 
Dlithsome, cte.. 
Then at last came winter, 
Withered the sweet ilow'rs, 
With them little Sophie, 
Passed to heav'nly bowers. 
This earth is sad and lonely, 
Since thy bright spirit's gone, 
I 
think of thee—thee only, 
'Tis only thee I 
mourn.

DOMINO DICK. 
Pals all, I 
salutes yer, hopes I 
sees yer well, 
Yer wonders who I 
am perhaps, well that I'll quickly tell, 
I'm not togg'd up swellish, in course yer doesn't doubt, 
I'm Dommino Dick, the sharper, the rummiest pippin out. 
CHORUS. 
I'm Domino Dick, I'm Domino Dick, 
A sharp young brick, up to every trick'. 
I'm Domino Dick, I'm Domino Dick, 
The Downy Bar Room swell. 
Talk about yer skittles, yer bowls and box and bagatelle, 
Also yer cards and billiards, in course they're very well, 
But dominoes it lick's ern so easy, d'ye see? 
I'm a 
crack one at, 'tis the game that just suits me. 
I'm Domino Dick, (Lc. 
I'm known in every Bar Room, for my skill in dominoes, 
And don't I 
cop the brown ' uns, I 
rather think I 
does. 
I'm not at all partic'lar, for cheating's best I 
find, 
A five to six will do well if I 
gets a 
cove half blind. 
I'm Domino Dick, 
I've got so many dodges, I 
never gets found out, 
The coves all thinks I'm clever— I 
am, without a 
doubt; 
But I 
must really leave yer, I've promist for to go 
And have a 
game this evening, so I'll now say domino. 
I'm Domino Dick, cEe. 
DARE-DEVIL DICK. 
I'd have you know I 
am just of age, 
No more my mammy can me control, 
Expects me to be wise as a sage, 
Does mammy, the dear good natured soul, 
It's '
my son why will you dance and sing, 
Such foolish nonsense it makes me sick.' 
Then with my laugh I 
make the house ring 
When she calls me her dare-devil Dick. 
ClIORUS. 
Oh my, dear me, what funny motion, 
I'd have you know whether day or night, 
I'm always in the notion. 
My girl she is the oddest of girls. 
She sports a 
chignon, a 
bend, and such; 
She has blue eyes and carroty curls, 
She's freckled but it don't hurt her much. 
My mammy says I 
show a 
queer taste, 
To such an odd girl, for life to stick, 
And when I 
laugh says may time I 
waste, 
Then she calls me her dare-devil Dick.

DO NOT CRUSH THE ROSES. 
Your small white hands, sweet sister of ours, 
Pluck from their frail branches these flow'rs, 
Cruel's such beauties though, you find, 
You throw them carelessly to the wind. 
Ali think how, here below, their beauties are disclosed ; 
Then do not crush the roses, do not strip off their leaves. 
Then do not crush the roses, do not strip off their leaves. 
Their broken stems without fruit, sad sight. 
What will they say, • the dews of the night," 
What will •• the we, ping zephyrs say ?" 
When you tear off the flowers each day, 
Alt think how, here below, their beauties are disclosed ; 
Then do not crush the roses, do not strip off their leaves. 
Then do not crush the ruses, do not strip off their leaves. 
'You cause their inward bosom sorrow, 
What evil doers for their morrow, 
Don't let your hands again pick these flow'rs, 
That they saw blooming, sister of ours. 
See thou then, here below, their beauties are disclosed ; 
Let the roses die, do not strip off their leaves. 
Let the roses die, do not strip off their leaves.

PAR-MORE-SO. 
Music published by J. L. PETERS, New York. 
Now, boys, come listen to my song, 
A song of timely warning, 
I 
say beware of doing wrong, 
For you'll repent next morning; 
Beware of going on a 
spree, 
Of rolling on the floor—so, 
For if you do, you'll find like me, 
That soon you'll befar more sot 
Beware, dear boys, of fusil oil, 
Beware of social drinking. 
For Rum is im relief for toil, 
And headaches hinder thinking; 
Whoever asks you up to 
rink, 
Will help to make you poor so, 
When you get ragged all will think, 
You loaferish far more so! 
My warning now I 
hope you'll heed, 
And this I 
freely render, 
If you would not your pocket bleed, 
Go for no Grecian Bender. 
However fair you find her face, 
Or beautiful her trousseau, 
She'll lead you such a 
rattling pace, 
You'll find you're gone,far more so! 
Since drink and women ruin men, 
All in the way of pleasure, 
Shun as a 
pe4ilence each dert 
Where bad men spend their leisure. 
Live virtuous lives, for happiness 
Your life will charm, of course so, 
And now I 
hope you acquiesce,'" 
That I 
am right, far more.so
