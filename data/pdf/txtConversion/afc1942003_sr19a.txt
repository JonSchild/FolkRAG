J. T. Wagoner: J. T. Wagoner, Burlington, Route 4. In behalf of the national defense, I want to assure
you that in my personal feeling, my family, and my neighbors, and friends that we all are one
hundred percent with you. And we'll have to do something and are going to do something to win
the war and do it quickly. If it takes what we have, our property, to do it we're for it. We're a hundred
percent with you and anything that takes our boys even them can go. That we have to do this thing
and to save our country and our religion means so much. If we lose we have lost it all. And we will
stand a hundred percent with you at all times and when we have won the victory then we will have
something to be proud of.
