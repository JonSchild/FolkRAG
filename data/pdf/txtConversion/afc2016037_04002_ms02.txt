From the Desk of Samuetta V. Marshall — District Three Governor 
Greetings Members and Guests 
Congratulations on your 90*^ Annual Convention in the wonderful city of Greenville, North Carolina. 
Ninety years of existence suggests that North Carolina has embraced and built a rich history and 
legacy in the funeral profession. This legacy has continued through and into another century. 
Your theme: Make It Happen, Make It Matter, The Pathway to Success speaks volumes. First, one 
has to have a defined goal to make happen. Then action steps must be conceived, thought through, 
put in order and finally engaged. 
Secondly, in defining the goal, it must be relevant, it must achievable and it must make a difference 
in the lives of those we serve and our businesses. 
Once these steps are accomplished, the only result is success. 
North Carolina, District Three, The Tri-State of the National Funeral Directors and Morticians 
Association, Inc. salutes you on your chosen pathway to promoting success and positivity in our 
beloved funeral profession. Our craft is not one of hastiness, but one of being cognizant of the fact 
that families are entrusting the care of their loved ones to us. This should never be taken lightly. 
While you're here in Greenville, take advantage of the educational opportunities, networking with 
colleagues and some good ole down time that we ail need. 
Looking forward to seeing ail of you in Myrtle Beach next month! 
Kindest regards, 
SMuteCUir 'THani^KiM

Greetings Colleagues, Friends and Guests: 
It is an honor and a privilege to welcome all of you to the 90th Annual Convention of the Funeral 
Directors and Morticians Association of North Carolina, Inc., in Greenville, North Carolina. 
As President of the Funeral Directors and Morticians Association of N.C, I invite you to enjoy 
yourselves while you are here. Our ‘Mighty Eastern District’ leadership team and planning committee 
have developed a number of exciting activities for everyone. Also while you’re here, remember to take 
advantage of the CEU offerings. 
In case you’re not familiar with Greenville, here’s a little background. Greenville is the county seat of 
Pitt County, the principal city of the Greenville metropolitan area, and the 10th largest city in the state 
of North Carolina. Greenville is the health, entertainment, and educational hub of North Carolina's 
Tidewater and Coastal Plain. The city's official population is about 90,000 residents while the 
Greenville Metropolitan Area is about 175,000 people. 
In January 2008 and January 2010, Greenville was named one of the nation's ”100 Best Communities for 
Young People” by the America's Promise Alliance. In June 2012, Greenville was ranked in the top ten of 
the nation's "Best Small Places for Business and Careers" by Forbes Magazine. In 2010 Greenville was 
ranked twenty-fourth in mid-city business growth and development by Forbes Magazine. 
We’re excited to host our convention in the city of Greenville! I believe this city embodies the 
entrepreneurial spirit that we share as Funeral Directors and Morticians. I encourage each of you to 
bring a friend or colleague who is not a member of this great association. It’s our opportunity to share 
with them the many benefits of membership. 
One of the highlights of our time together will be the Awards Banquet and Presidents’ Gala ‘People, 
Purpose & Passion: The Pathway to Successes’. I hope you will come out as we celebrate 90 years of 
service to our communities. This event will be held on Wednesday, June 21, at 8 p.m., at the Greenville 
Hilton, our host hotel. 
Thanks for your faith, your confidence and support of me as your President over the past year. My goal 
remains to work with each of you to provide the best leadership that we can for our organization and 
for the families whom we serve. I hope you enjoy a week of fun, relaxation, and connecting with your 
professional colleagues, family and friends. I look forward to seeing you soon!

Greeting Colleagues and Guests: 
Once again it is an honor and a privilege to welcome you to the 
annual convention of the Funeral Directors & Morticians Association 
of North Carolina, Inc. As we celebrate this 90 year milestone of such 
a great association, we have been blessed. 
To our Exhibitors & Sponsors, we appreciate your continued support 
and your choosing to exhibit with us this year. We want you to know 
that your dedication will not go unnoticed. 
I am thankful for our faithful and supportive members who have 
been devoted to advancement of our association. We are proud of 
this 90 year legacy. The road may not have been easy and the 
sacrifices were great, but our association has continued to strive for excellence. As I look 
back at our history, our first president was Mr. C.W. Costner and our 2017 Souvenir Journal 
Recipient for this year is Albert Costner, Jr. the grandson of our first president. There are so 
many who made our association what it is today. Let’s continue to hold on to those morals 
and the foundation that has been laid so that we are able to pass the torch to the next 
generation. We will continue standing on the shoulders of present and past members as we 
embark on future endeavors. 
To my district -the Mighty Piedmont District-thank you for your continued support and lastly, 
but certainly not least, to the staff of Kelsey Funeral Home, Albemarle, I could not do any of 
this without your support and your help handling things when Fm on the road or in the office. 
You are a great bunch to have in my corner. I really do appreciate you all so much. 
Please enjoy your stay in Greenville. Take the time to take in the sites this week and I hope 
that you have a relaxing few days away from the office.

The black tear shaped Logo represents 
the tears the Black Woman had thru trials 
and tribulations, but could not shed- 
too strong, too Proud. 
The profile carved of Mahogany signifies 
the strength and Beauty of the Black Woman, 
in her eyes 1 cannot show the compassion 
They reflect for others. 
The delicate jewelry she wears was fashioned 
by hands that toiled the fields and nursed 
the ill. 
The broken chain represents the bondage 
She broke thru her faith in God 
The motto "Dictisfacta suppetant" in Latin 
The Mother of all Languages, as the Black 
Woman is the Mother of Mankind.
