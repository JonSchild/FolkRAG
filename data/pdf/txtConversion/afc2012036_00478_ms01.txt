Fletcher Powell, June 10, 2013, talking to Congressman Mike Pompeo in his 
office in east Wichita. 
 
Despite the fact that I just said who you are, tell us who you are. 
 
I’m Mike Pompeo, I’m the Congressman for the 4th District of Kansas. 
 
What year were you born, and where did you grow up? 
 
So, I was born in 1963 and grew up in Santa Ana, California, that’s, uh, my original 
home. My mother’s from Kansas, uh, but I grew up in southern California. 
 
Ok. And, while you were growing up, was there anyone in your family—or maybe even 
further back—who was involved in aviation in any way? 
 
Oh, yes. Uh, so, my father worked for a company called Standard Press Steel, they 
made, uh, fasteners, hardware, uh, for the aviation industry. And, in fact, the story 
goes, he actually met my mother—my mother’s from Wellington, Kansas, Wellington 
High Crusader, class of, I think it’s 1947—who, when she graduated from high 
school, came to work for The Boeing Company, uh, right after World War II. Uh, and 
so, worked for The Boeing Company for a whole bunch of years, uh, and that’s how 
my mother and father actually met. Uh, she was buying fasteners and she was selling 
fasteners. And they talked on the phone for a couple of years, and finally, my father 
said, ‘why don’t you come out and visit?’ And my mother, who I don’t think had ever 
been on an airplane before, uh, got in an airplane and flew to southern California. 
And they were engaged that weekend. 
 
Even though she worked for Boeing, she’d—no airplane? 
 
Yeah, exactly. And, so, yeah, The Boeing Company’s history runs deep in our family, 
a lot of my—a lot of her brothers and sisters worked for The Boeing Company, so 
my aunts and uncles, lots of family that was part of the aviation industry for an 
awfully long time. 
 
Wow, yeah. After—were you in California until you were finished with high school? 
 
Till high school, then I went to West Point and graduated from there and lived in 
the—I was in the Army, so lived a little bit of all over for half a dozen years, uh, and 
then moved to Kansas in the mid-1990s to start a company that was related to the 
aviation industry, a company that became Thayer Aerospace. 
 
And so you moved here probably because of how prominent the aviation industry is 
here. 
 
Absolutely, started—moved here with a couple of friends to start a company that 
ended up running what was, essentially, a machine shop, doing welding and 
fabricating components, selling to Lockheed and Gulfstream and Boeing and all the 
airframe manufacturers. 
 
Ok. How did that come about? How did you get involved in that? 
 
Ah, just two good old friends who decided we wanted to go out on our own and start 
a company, and we had lots of different ideas, but one that ultimately came to fit us 
was manufacturing. And I knew a little bit about this, I’m a mechanical engineer by 
training, uh, but didn’t know sic ‘em about lots of pieces of the aviation supply chain. 
Uh, but we ended up—there was a company on the north end of Wichita, at 7330 
North Broadway, uh, that we acquired, uh, and we started Thayer Aerospace out at 
that site, right across from the 81 Speedway. Would have been 1997 or 1998, I can’t 
recall. 
 
Ok. And then you had Thayer until… 
 
Until 2005, I left Thayer Aerospace, uh, 2005 or 2006. 
 
Ok. Talk a little bit about those seven or eight years, eight years or so, uh, while you 
were involved with Thayer. What did you guys—who did you deal with, did you deal 
with Boeing specifically? 
 
We did, we dealt with Boeing, they were Aero Machine Company’s largest 
customer—uh, the company that we purchased—far and away, Cessna would have 
been their second-biggest customer at the time. So we dealt with Boeing and the 
people out at Boeing all the time, their engineers, their purchasing group, their 
commercial practices folks as well. Uh, so met lots of great people out at The Boeing 
Company. Uh, we then lived through the change, where Boeing sold off the large 
manufacturing fabrication facility to Spirit Aerosystems, and they became, then, a 
very significant customer for Thayer Aerospace, we made lots of parts that went on 
the737 fuselage, uh, that then became components that Spirit was manufacturing, so 
we transitioned—uh, we still did some work for the Boeing defense side, what was 
left here in Wichita of Boeing. So we still did some work on the B52 and the like, uh, 
but frankly most of our business for Boeing, uh, after the Spirit acquisition was for 
Boeing in other parts of the country. We did work for Boeing out in Washington 
state, a great deal of work for Boeing out in St. Louis, the old McDonnell Douglas 
facility, uh, so we still had Boeing as a very significant customer, even after the 
transition to Spirit Aerosystems. 
 
So, you started your company probably around the time that Boeing merged with 
McDonnell Douglas, um, so I don’t know if you would have seen much of a change at 
that point, but could you see, sort of, changes through your business that Boeing might 
have been going through? Ups and downs or work cultural changes? 
 
4:40 
 
Sure, oh sure, there’s always change when there’s major structural corporate 
changes like with McDonnell Douglas or the change to Spirit Aerosystem, uh, some 
from a supplier’s perspective that are really welcome, others that are less so. You 
end up often dealing with the same human beings, which is great because that 
provides the transition—I think both good for the supplier and the customer to have 
that continuity at those times of change. But you do see companies change, and they 
always—the Boeing Company, on the commercial side, in particular—uh, look, 
would always benefit and suffer from cycles. We went from a time when Boeing was 
building a couple hundred airplanes a year—commercial, Boeing commercial built a 
couple hundred airplanes a year to times when they were building as many as 500. 
And it would cycle. And, uh, so your workload would move in that same direction, 
that piece of it was unavoidable, and so as a supplier you had to try and make sure 
that you had work in other places as well. Work that was on military aircraft—that 
had its own cycle—uh, work that was on general aviation aircraft, so we did 
business with Gulfstream, and Cessna, and Learjet as well, as well as some work for 
what was then Hawker Beech, now Beechcraft. And so you tried to create the right 
mix so you could sustain the right workload to keep you company going and keep, 
uh, keep employees on the payroll. 
 
So you were able to diversify enough that none of the downturns in any one area— 
 
As best you could. We were running Thayer Aerospace following 9/11 and there 
was no place to hide. Every one of the folks who was building airframes, uh, on the 
commercial side, in particular, uh, suffered greatly from demand. And so our 
business did as well. We shrunk from something in the order of 400 folks to just 
under 300 employees in the aftermath of 9/11. And it took us quite a time to get 
those folks back and rebuild the team, it was a very difficult time for Thayer 
Aerospace, but for The Boeing Company and all the airframers. Weren’t too many 
folks interested in buying too many airplanes when nobody’s flying. 
 
That’s interesting that you mention that, because, strangely enough, I don’t remember 
talking to anybody yet who’s mentioned the impact of 9/11 on Boeing. And as you just 
said, I imagine it must have been huge. 
 
It was a restart, in some sense. You know, the airframers all work off of enormous 
backlogs. And so today, the Boeing Company would know it has enough—pick an 
airframe, 747s, 787s—to build for the next two or three years. But you saw 
enormous order cancellations. I mean, the global demand for aircraft just (snaps 
fingers) shut down, uh, like that. And so we saw our backlog shrink by as much as 
half. And so you really had to say, ‘what are we gonna go do?’ when it creates that 
capacity, the supply base, you start to have customers demand lower prices as well, 
so all the challenges that come from a shrinking marketplace. And we felt them all, I 
know all of the supply base did. Um, but we knew our customer was going through 
that as well. They too had an enormous workforce that they had to try and reach in 
and convince their customers to renew their fleets and continue buying airplanes. 
So it was a very challenging time, uh, globally for aviation manufacturing, most 
especially in the commercial markets.  
 
You said you had Thayer until ’05 or ’06— 
 
Yes. 
 
What prompted you to leave? 
 
You know, my partner—there were two of us left in the business who had originally 
started it, and we at that point had been doing it for about a decade, and for a host of 
personal reasons we thought it made sense to begin the transition. So we started 
doing that, we hired our replacements, we ultimately sold our interests in the 
business to a private equity firm. And I think it was ultimately good for Thayer 
Aerospace to see that, too, after a decade all the good ideas we’d had, we’d applied 
them, and so I think it was the right time for both Brian and me, personally, as well 
as for the company to change and a new set of leadership come into place—it’s still 
out there on 119th Street west, the facility in St. Louis I understand is still out there, 
too, so we’re happy about that legacy, as well. 
 
And then so you ran and won a seat as a congressman in 2008? 
 
In 2010. 
 
In 2010, right. Ok, and obviously you’re still there now—talk a little bit about 
whatever your involvement might have been in the so-called Boeing “tanker deal.” 
 
Oh, sure. 
 
Talk a little bit about what it is, to begin with, and then what involvement you might 
have had. 
 
9:14 
 
Uh, sure. So, there had been a long-running procurement process to build the next 
generation of Air Force tanker refueling systems, uh, been going on maybe as much 
as a decade. The KC-135 is a great airplane, but it’s now older than the pilots that 
are flying it. And so the Air Force knew they needed to replace it, they had run a 
competition, there were two bidders, there was an Airbus airplane and a Boeing 
airplane that were both competing for this contract, it was a big deal contract, they 
were gonna build a hundred or 200 of these airplanes, so both companies wanted it 
very, very much and they fought like the dickens for an awfully long time. And it was 
absolutely a commercial fight, but it became a political battle as well. And so, I don’t 
remember the sequencing, it was before my time in Congress, but ultimately the 
Boeing Company was selected after a couple of awards and some protests, but The 
Boeing Company actually won the KC-46 tanker in my first two months in office. Uh, 
so I think I was sworn in on January 3rd and if I recall right the decision was 
announced in February, uh, so I had almost nothing to do with that. Uh, we certainly 
spend 60 days trying to encourage the Air Force to build the Boeing tanker, but the 
die, I’m sure, had been cast long before that. But it was a great thing for the 
community have The Boeing Company have won that contract, and then ultimately 
disappointing as they made a manufacturing decision to build that airplane 
someplace else. 
 
And, I remember, at the time, certainly you didn’t hide your feelings about that 
decision. 
 
Uh, no, you know, I, maybe this isn’t very politic, as a politician, but I seldom hide my 
feelings about much of anything. Uh, look, I was very disappointed, I was 
disappointed in that so many in this community, folks out at Boeing, suppliers, had 
worked awfully hard to help develop the proposal that ultimately proved to be the 
winning proposal. And The Boeing Company had committed to building that here, 
they told us, ‘if we are successful, we’re gonna build that airplane in Wichita, Kansas, 
out at that site.’ So when they ultimately concluded they weren’t gonna do that, I 
was very disappointed, um, I was upset that they were not gonna be able to honor 
the commitment that they’d made to the community. But, we’re now in the post, uh, 
post-decision process, phase, out at the site, and, like Wichita, Kansas always had, 
we’ll move on, we’ll continue to grow, we’ll find a good use for the resources out at 
that facility and we’ll continue to grow our aviation economy. The departure of The 
Boeing Company here, as personally disappointing as it is, I told you about my 
family having been involved, you can’t go talk to anyone who hasn’t had an aunt or 
an uncle or a cousin, or their teachers, that didn’t work at The Boeing Company, for 
literally generations now—so as disappointing as it is that banner is gonna leave 
south Oliver, for the community we’ll still be the Air Capital of the World, still build 
lots of airplanes. The Spirit side carries on the legacy from Boeing and has lots of 
Boeing product in there, so they’re incredibly important for our community even 
though we’re not going to have the Boeing sign up there on those buildings. 
 
You said Spirit will continue to carry on the legacy for Boeing, looking a few decades 
down the line, what do you think that legacy will be? And not necessarily with Spirit, 
but what do you think—when people think of Boeing in Wichita, what do you think 
their legacy will be? 
 
You can’t escape the history of how it’s shaped our community. Good jobs for, for 
folks like my mother, with a high school diploma, who found good work out at the 
place, was able to begin to build her life there. That’s, it’s so true for many of the 
institutions here, right? Wichita State is so deeply connected to aerospace because 
of the history, whether it was Stearman, and Boeing, and Beech, and Cessna and all 
those places. These things are just intrinsically part, now, of south central Kansas, in 
a way, culturally and, gosh, even spiritually, that the Boeing legacy will live on here 
for decades and decades. There’ll still be folks talking about The Boeing Company in 
Wichita long after I’ve departed this place.  
So maybe, um, it sounds like maybe some short-term disappointment and, um, hurt, 
will probably eventually give way to just a larger sense of all the contributions they’ve 
made? 
 
13:43 
 
Yeah, I don’t think there’s any doubt about that. Uh, look, we all recognize 
businesses make decisions that they have to make to continue to survive and to 
thrive, and I’m a deep—deeply committed to companies having the right to make 
those decisions, so I don’t fault The Boeing Company for that at all. I wish they’d 
been able to find a way to do it here, but we just weren’t able to, to, uh, make that 
happen and to see a way to that. And so, the legacy of The Boeing Company won’t be 
its departure, that won’t be the thing that folks remember, uh, 10, or 15, or 20 years 
from now. What people will remember is all the great things The Boeing Company 
did for this community and the great things this community did for The Boeing 
Company. Great workforce, talented engineers and welders and procurement 
people, sheet metal, uh, assembly people, I mean, just the talent and capacity of the 
human beings that, um, helped The Boeing Company succeed and become what it is 
today. It certainly won’t be forgotten by this community and I know, when you talk 
to the folks out at Boeing, they know, too, how important Wichita was to them for so 
long. And then they remind us they still have an enormous amount of their airplane 
built in this community as well. So I think the Boeing legacy has to be one that is a 
positive influence on so many lives here in Kansas. I hope we’ll all tell our kids and 
our grandkids about how great Boeing was to be part of south central Kansas.
