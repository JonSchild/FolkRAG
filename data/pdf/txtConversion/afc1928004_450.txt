Water on the Brain. 
Comk•csed by PETE CANNON, and presented to J. F. 
FIELDS. 
I've always been a 
drinker, 
Since the day that I 
was born ; 
I 
never could re.-,ist 
Though it can.e.cl me mItc.,h pain. 
My head is swelling lately, 
And I'm broken no completely, 
And all my friends imagine 
I 
have water on the brain, 
[Repeat last two lines. 
I 
went into a 
porter house 
To get a 
glass of porter, 
When a 
man came up to stab me, 
And. I 
thought he was insane ; 
He made at me some frightful blows, 
I 
knocked them off and broke his nose, 
Oh, to see me fight you'd not suppose 
I 
had water on the brain. 
[Repeat last two lines. 
My wife is home and in Ler bed, 
And sleeping very quietly, 
She says that I'm a 
drunken brute 
And that I 
treat her mean ; 
She calls me a 
loafer, 
And a 
good-for-nothing toper, 
Says it's whiskey, and not water, that 
I've got upon my brain. 
[ltepeat last two 
And now I 
must be going 
For to get a 
glass of liquor, 
My throat is in a 
fever, 
And I'm getting dry again ; 
A doctor told me I 
must take 
Some whiskey for my stomach's sake, 
For whiskey on the stomach 
Beats the water on the brain. 
[Repeat lastlines. 
My Grandfather's Hen. 
Composed by NED OLIVER. 
Dedicated to JOHN F. 
FIELDS. 
My grandfather Ben had an old Shanghai hen 
Who laid eggs the size of a 
keg; 
She stood six feet high, from her foot to her thigh, 
And she measured one yard around the leg. 
She had an old rooster, her company for to keep, 
But at last he was killed and served fried, 
And she stopped, short, never to lay again, 
When the Shanghai Rooster died. 
CHORUS. 
No more fresh eggs in the morning, chick, chick, chick, el/lick, 
The breakfast table adorning, chick, chick, chick, chick; 
But stopped, short, never to lay again, 
When the Shanghai Rooster died. 
In roaming around the farm the old hen took delight, 
And when evening's shades began to fall 
She'd hop up on the roof with the rest of the gang, 
Or stay out with her shanghai on the wall. 
But when daylight did appear, to the corn patch they 
would steer, 
And they would gobble up worms side by side: 
But she stopped, short. never to gobble again, 
When the Shanghai Rooster died 
No more fresh eggs, &c. 
Sting by PAT ROONEY. 
Presented to FIELDS and H ANSON. 
Give my boxing-gloves to brother, mammie, when I'm dead, 
When the sexton puts me under in my little bed ; 
If the job is like to throw him when the string he jerks, 
Get some little boy to show him how the old thing works. 
[Repeat last line. 
Mamma, buy me a 
bran new Ulster, hire a 
Pullman car, 
Give me a 
bath of Florida water, I 
see the gates ajar ; 
Give me a 
dose of paregoric—there's nothing about me mean, 
Give the sexton half a 
dollar to see that my grave's kept green. 
[Repeat last line. 
411 
Give my chewing gum to sister, I 
don't want it any more, 
On my lips it raised a 
blister that was awful sore ; 
Sing to me the Last Rose of Summer—mamma, don't you cry, 
For in the clouds I'll raise a 
racket, in the sweet by and by. 
[Repeat last line. 
Sprinkle my body with powdered sugar, smear me over with 
tar. 
Cover my form with peacock's feathers— I 
want to be an 
angel, ma; 
Let me bite the old torn cat's tail off, she can't ketch no mice, 
Let me go bathing with the girls— it's naughty, but it's nice, 
[Repeat last line. 
O'Hoolahan, What Dol . 1
7. )11 Say? 
Composed and sung with great success by CHARLES A. 
GREAR, America's 
Own Mimic, and kindly dedicated to my friend JouN F. FIELDS. 
Good evening to you, one and all, 
I'm glad to find you well, 
To listen to my tale of woes 
That Fin about to tell. 
I 
cannot take my daily walks, 
And I'll tell you the reason why, 
The gang all shout as I 
walk out, 
O'Hoolahan, what der you say ? 
CHORUS. 
They're setting me almost crazy now, 
12And I'll tell you the reason why, 
'or the gang all shout as I 
walk out, 
O'Hoolaban, what der you say ? 
I 
stepped into a 
restaurant 
To get a 
bite to eat, 
I 
thought I 
would enjoy myself, 
And none of the gang I'd meet 
The waiter looked at me and laughed , 
Say i give me a 
custard pie 
When through the halt he dia lowly bawl, 
O'Hoolahan, what der you ay. 
Falling Snow-Flakes. 
Softly, lightly, feathered snow-flakes, 
Fall upon my mother's tomb ; 
Add no more unto my sorrow, 
To my loneliness and gloom. 
Softly. lightly, white-wing'd snow- flakes, 
Fall upon the tear- stained mound, 
Where the sleeping form of mother 
Waits the resurrection sound. 
CHORUS. 
Snow- flakes, snow- flakes, in your falling 
On the hallow'd earth I 
love, 
Are there angel voices calling 
Mother's spirit up above ? 
Long beside her grave I 
lingered, 
Reading on the marble stone, 
Those dear loving words : `• Our Mother," 
Who to heaven s 
gate has flown. 
Far above the snow-drops falling 
Mother rests from worldly woe ; 
Snow- flakes only hide the mortal, 
Perishing beneath the snow. 
[CHORUS. 
And the white-winged flakes kept falling 
From the dark o'erhanging cloud, 
Till they wrapped the grave of mother 
In a 
white and spotless shroud ; 
Then anto my heart I 
whispered, 
As the tear- drops ceased to flow, 
" 
There could be no fitter mantle 
O'er her grave than spotless snow." 
[CHORUS

We're Going Home. 
Written and sung by Favoa and SHIELDS. 
Presented YO FIELDS and 
HANSON, the " American Musical Team." 
We came from dear old Ireland, 
Where the apple praties grow, 
Way over across the ocean 
In a 
town called Ballmasloe, 
We left our wives, God bless them, 
Which made our hearts feel sore ; 
But now we're tired roaming around, 
So we're going home once more. 
CHORUS. 
We're going home, we're going home, 
For now we're tired roaming around. 
So we're going home again. 
[Repeat Chorus.] 
Oh take us back to Ireland, 
Where we were bred and born 
Way out among the shamrocks, 
So early in the morn. 
We think we see the dear ones 
A coming down the lane, 
When we'll get back to Erin's Isle 
-We'll never roam again. 
We're going home, &e. 
Will I 
Always be Your Darling? 
Dedicated YO FRANK HANSON. 
Ily OSCAR R. 
BEERS. 
Will I 
always be your darling, 
As we journey down life's sea? 
Will the wife be just as precious 
As the sweetheart seems to be? 
There may be rough waves to weather, 
Over which our bark may sail, 
Do you think our hearts together 
Will ride smoothly through the gale? 
CIIORITS. 
Will I 
always be your darling? 
Tell me honest, tell me true, 
If forever and forever 
I 
will be as dear to you? 
When the silver hair shall mingle 
With the curly locks of gold, 
And my face, careworn and wrinkled, 
Tells you I 
am getting old ; 
Will I 
be the same dear darling, 
When shall come life's harvest days ? 
Will the love be then as ardent, 
And the lips as fondly praise ? 
Will I 
always, &c. 
9 
Composed by JoE A. BURGESS, and sung with immense success by Miss 
ANNIE BURGESS. 
Presented to FIELDS and H ANSON. 
In a 
little cottage neatly built 
Upon old Ireland's shore, 
Where the shamrock and the thistle grows so free, 
Lives a 
colleen dear so sweet and fair 
Upon that isle so green, 
And her dear face now I 
often long to see. 
CHORUS. 
But she's far away from me across the deep blue sea, 
Could I 
but see her bright sweet face once more. 
And when we met as strangers, 
Then I 
vowed we'd meet again ; 
She's my darling treasure, 
Pride of Ireland's shore. 
Oh, my love for her has grown stronger 
Since we met on Erin's shore, 
And I 
long to see the land where I 
was born, 
Anef'to tell the love that I 
have cherished 
All those years for her, 
And to hear her kind heart's answer in return. 
But she's far away, &c. 
I 
have seen the Isle so green, 
I've gained my fair colleen: 
Her love so pure is mine forevermore. 
And when we -met as strano:crs 
Then I 
vowed we'd rnect a;ain ; 
I've my darling treasure, pride of Ireland's shore. 
But she's far away, &c. 
Written by NED OLIVER, and sung by J. F. FIELDS. 
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, 
I'm glad to see you all ; 
I 
was just a 
passing by this way, 
I 
thought I'd give you a 
call, 
To tell you how the darkies 
Used to frolic one and all, 
In that little cabin home in South Caroline, 
CHORUS. 
Don't talk of ' mancipation proclamation unto me ; 
I 
was happier in slavery then I've been since I've been free. 
Oh ! we war so jolly, we war as happy as could be 
In that little cabin home in South Caroline. 
We used to get up in the morn, 
Before the break of day, 
And go off singing to our work 
In the cotton fields away. 
And when night came we'd sing and dance 
And on the banjo play, 
In that little cabin home in South Caroline, 
CHORUS. 
But these happy days are past and gone many years ago, 
My eyes are growing weak and dim, my steps are getting slow, 
And the time am drawing nearer now in which 
have to go 
From that little cabin home in South Caroline, 
The McGluggens. 
Composed by JoE BURGESS, and sung by the BURGESSES with immense 
success at the Olympic Theatre, Brooklyn. 
Presented to FIELDS and HANSON. 
So now we are here ! we bid good cheer 
To all our new-made friends, 
And sing a 
song, it won't be long, 
And we wish your kind amends. 
We've been here but a 
day or so 
From that Emerald Isle so grand, 
We are the two McGluggens 
From dear old Ireland. 
CliORIJS. 
Then sing it aloud and let the people know, 
Give us a 
hold of your hand; 
We are the two McG1u2gens 
From dear old Ireland. 
[Repeat.] 
And now, kind friends, we must away, 
For work now we must try, 
And should good luck fall in our way 
To the Green Isle we will fly 
It s 
the country true and noble, 
Where they'd shake us by the hand, 
And bid welcome to the McGlug:ens 
Back to old Ireland. 
Then sing it aloud, &O, 
The Fifth Avenue Fair. 
Written by BEN COLLINS, of TURNER & COLLINS and sung by TONY 
PASTOR, with great success. 
If you will listen awhile to the song I 
will sing, 
I 
will tell you some funny and curious things. 
It isn't Whoa, Emma! or Our Front Stoop, 
Nor My Mary Ann, for she has the croup. 
It ain't Where Was Moses, or the Isle De Blackwell, 
But I'm sure when you've heard it, your head it will swell, 
So list to the words and don't mind the air, 
And I'll tell you about the Fifth Avenue Fair. 
Susan B. Anthony, she had a 
stand, 
And was selling cheap tickets for the promised land; 
Mary Walker was there, but got full of I 
ooze, 
And they raffled her off with O'Leary's big shoes. 
Dennis Kearney was talking to Moody and Sank, 
Fixing a 
job on the Manhattan Bank, 
Owney Geoghehan came in with bear grease on his hair, 
And was too sweet to live at the Fifth Avenue Fair. 
There was bald-headed babies and lively mammas 
Ancient old maidens and half full papas, 
Two blushing young girls had a 
boxing glove fight, 
And said Francis Murphy was a 
little bit tight. 
Mrs. jinks she got up for a 
temperance speech, 
But she fell through the floor with a 
terrible screech; 
Harry Hill he rushed in with a 
rush-bottom chair, 
But they all rushed him out at the Fifth Avenue Fair. 
Hughes, the pedestrian, started to walk, 
All the widows sat down for a 
long-winded talk, 
Gallant Ben Butler got in on a 
check. 
Two song and dance men walked in on their neck. 
The hero of Baxter" street waltzed a 
quadrille, 
A 
deaf and dumb man was talking to handsome Tom Gill; 
Dr. Talma;e was sleeping in Washington Square, 
And nursed all the sin at the Fifth Avenue Fair. 
Written for TONY PASTOR by Jim J. NELSON, and sung by him with 
great success. 
Now you all have heard the news of late, 
Of a 
visit made to this, our State, 
By a 
great Celestial potentate, 
That embassy from China. 
When they first upon our shores did land, 
The bon- ton took them by the hand, 
And welcomed them in style so grand. 
As on the mail dock they did stand. 
Both rich and poor alike were there, 
The smell of opium filled the air, 
And the Anti- coolie men did swear, 
At the great Chinese Reception. 
There was Slippery Jake, he was hand-in-hand 
With the leader of a 
Chinese band, 
And Emperor Norton with his grand 
Display of bums and snoozers ; 
There was Buffalo Bill, and Captain Jack, 
With Red Head Sal from Kalamazak, 
They made a 
grand display, in fact, 
They carried the Joss upon their back. 
The free-lunch fiends were next in line, 
Oh, how their clothes with grease did shine, 
They were smoking butts preserved in lime, 
At the great Chinese Reception, 
The next in line was Susan B. 
She was trying to skip the tra-al-la-lee, 
With the undertaker, Jimmy McGee, 
At the great Chinese Reception. 
The next I 
saw was Jimmy Slack, 
Mike Reee and him had hired a 
hack, 
And just behind came Happy Jack, 
Who on the temperance cause went back, 
Most everything and everyone, 
Determined not to be outdone, 
They all did go to see the fun, 
At the great Chinese Reception. 
Parody OD Kiss Me Again. 
Sung by Andy Collum, 
I 
sat down one night on an old cellar door, 
Around the corner i 
i 
front of a 
Dutch grocer:: store, 
Thinking of honto, and my clothes all in hock, 
When suddenly I 
experienced a 
terrible shock, 
The door gave away and unlucky I 
fell, 
I 
bursted my pantaloons and undergarments as well, 
I 
struck on my head on the hard cellar floor, 
And the proprietor bounced me up through the door. 
CHOR U 
S. 
He kicked me again in the bosom of my pants, 
Which made my stomach feel queer, 
Be kicked me again and because I 
complained, 
Out on the sidewalk I 
walked on my ear. 
Kicks are a 
thing that all bummers can get, 
If they hang around saloons and cigar stores you bet, 
They are always given freely and don't cost a 
cent, 
And the place that you get them are sure to be bent, 
If once you get landed out into the street, 
You hardly would care the dose to repeat, 
Boot toes have nails in and makes you feel sore, 
And always are ready to kick you once more. 
CHORUS. 
He kicked me again, &c.

COMIC SKETCH . 
FOR TWO CHARACTERS. 
MALE AND FEMALE. 
BY SAUL SERTREW. 
SCENE.—A room containing- a screen, chairs, table, Kehoe 
clubs, boxing gloves, imitation music box on a 
stand, banjo 
or guitar on the wall. 
H ARRY (
outside, to 
servant)—Have the carriage ready 
by 4 
o'clock precisely. 
See that Dexter is taken the best of 
care of, for I've had a 
long drive this morning. 
Enter HARRY, in a 
jolly humor. 
H ARRY—By 
Jove! I've had a magnificent time on the 
road this morning! 
Now, there's nothing so bracing and 
exhilarating to the physique as a morning dash on the 
back of a mettled steed. 
Off you go on the wings of 
the wind! 
I think I can now enjoy my breakfast with 
a gusto. (Takes off gloves, hat, and lays down riding 
whip. 
Goes to table and discovers letters, which he opens 
and reads.) 
Hum, let me see. 
Invitations to balls, soirees, 
yacht club dinners, etcetera. 
Now, what pleasure 
these 
entertainments would afford some people; but I 
don't en-
joy them half as much as I should. 
Ah! how happy I 
ought to be, surrounded by every luxury a 
man could wish 
for, yet sometimes I 
feel as wretched as possible, simply 
because I 
have no one to share these pleasures with me. I 
long for a 
partner in my joys. 
Here I've been a 
bachelor for 
the past ten years, and have as yet met with no one whom I 
fancy, no one who is the woman of my choice. 
Some may 
say that I 
am hard to suit, but I 
don't think I 
am. My 
choice is a 
true woman. 
Not one of those hot-house plants 
that a 
draught from a 
key-hole could wither. 
No; my choice 
is a 
good-hearted, lively, spirited, noble woman, who is not 
afraid to meet the storms of life, but will be happy in its rain 
as well as its sunshine. (Excitedly.) 
One who can row a 
boat, ride a 
horse, shoot a 
bird on the wing, swim, sing, 
dance, and, if necessary, knock any man down who dares to 
insult her. 
Yes, that's my style ! 
But where am I 
going to 
find such a 
woman ? 
That's the conundrum. (Female voice 
heard without, singing.) " Ah, just hear that now. 
There's 
happiness, there's music for you. 
Listen to that canary. 
That's the female who does the housework, and she is as 
nice a 
young woman as you would wish to see. 
In conversa-
tion with her one day, I 
asked what made her so happy; she 
said, " because she was poor." 
And many times since I 
have 
wished that I 
was poor and contented. 
If I 
was I 
would set 
my cap for her, for she seems so full of spirits and hilarity that 
I 
am a 
little smitten with her, and I 
almost begin to think 
I 
am in love with her. 
Well, I 
suppose she wants to come in 
to dress the room, so I'll go down to my morning meal, and 
give the damsel a 
chance to fit up my bachelor's roost. 
Sings. 
Oh, I'm a 
jolly bachelor, 
My heart is free as air ; 
But I 
would like some pretty girl 
My life and love to share. 
My nature is the very best, 
I'll never prove unkind ; 
To live no more a 
single man 
I've just made up my mind. 
Oh, I'm a 
jolly bachelor, 
have money to command; 
And yet I'm not a 
happy 'Ban, 
Though all around is grand. 
I 
need some good and lovely sou' 
To cheer my onward way; 
So if there's one will have me here, 
Why, take me then to-day. [Exit. 
Enter BETsEY , duster and broom in hand. 
BETSEY (
slyly 
looking in)—Anybody here? ( Looking 
about.) No; he's gone out. I 
heard him singing as he went. 
18 
Ah, dear me; what a 
jolly fellow he is, indeed. 
Well, I've 
just made up his bed and swept up his sleeping apartment, 
and I 
thought I'd just dust about his smoking room, or his 
gymnasium, as he calls it. 
Well, he's the nicest gentleman 
in the house (dusts off chairs). 
And he is always so good-
natured and so happy. 
Ali, me ! Whenever I 
get the blues I 
go up to his door and listen to his singing or his playing on 
his musical instruments. 
And he's a 
bachelor, too. 
What a 
pity! 
Such a 
nice young man to be a 
bachelor, but I 
sup-
pose he'd rather be a 
bachelor. 
But I 
wouldn't if I 
were he ! 
I 
suppose he's got plenty of money, and has everything he 
wants (dusts music box). 
Now, here's his music box, and 
there's his banjo, his boxing gloves and his darling little kid 
gloves. (Goes to table where his hat and gloves are; picks 
up gloves and blows in them; tries them on.) 
Why, they 
almost fit me. ( Puts on hat.) 
Now, I 
wonder how I 
would 
look in such a 
hat ? (Goes to glass, admires herself, dancing, 
&c.) 
Oh, my, if he should catch me with his hat on he 
would think I 
1:vas very rude. ( Puts off hat and gloves, dusts 
the banjo.) 
And here is his banjo. 
What a 
funny looking 
thing it is ! ( Takes down and strikes the strings.) 
Oh, my, 
now I 
wonder if I 
could play on this frying pan ? (Takes chair 
and plays a 
solo.) 
While she is playing enters HARRY through bach 9
7oor; starts 
with surprise, and listens. 
HARRY (aside)—By the groat boots of Wellington and 
my forefather's ancestor, what have we here? 
By heavens, 
it's the chambermaid ! I 
must enjoy this fun, which I 
can do 
without her seeing me. 
I'll just hide behind the screen. 
(Goes behind screen, and peeps over the top ; makes gestures 
of delight at her playing.) 
BETSEY (after solo)-0h, my goodness! 
If ho should 
have beard me ! 
Making so familiar with his property ! 
I 
would get jessy-cats! (Runs and puts up banjo, and dusts 
about the room in a 
hurry and goes to the imitation music 
box, which has a 
crank at side.) 
Here's another one of his 
10 
playthings. 
Oh, how nice! 
I've heard this music box play 
some of the most beautiful airs you ever heard. 
All you've 
got to do is to turn this crank and that winds up this machine, 
and away she goes. (Turns crank, and some one behind the 
scenes plays a 
jig on a 
violin.) 
Oh, jimminy ! just listen to 
that! 
It's enough to make a 
butterfly dance! (Throws down 
duster, and dances a 
jig.) 
Harry, peeping over the screen, is perfectly delighted. 
I3ETsEv (after jig)-0h, my, what a noise 
I've been 
making! What will folks say in the house ? I 
can't help it-
I'm so fond of music. 
Sings. 
"I 
AM SO FOND OF MUSIC ." 
AIR: Chorus of " I'm So Fond of Dancing. n 
I'am so fond of music 
I 
never can be still! 
And when I 
hear the banjo,

CURTAIN. 
My Little One Waiting for Me, 
IN the dell where the brooklets gently flowing, 
On the bench ' neath the old willow tree, 
Where the birds their songs are sweetly singing, 
There my little one's waiting for me; 
And she knows well the sound of my footsteps, 
As I 
cross o'er the bridge by the lea, 
And I 
hasten with arms stretch'd to greet her, 
My little one waiting for me. 
And at night when daily toil is over, 
And I'm wending my way toward my home, 
My heart's always beating with pleasure, 
For my little one surely will come; 
As I 
pass o'er that clear rippling brooklet, 
There, watching, I 
always can see, 
On the bench ' neath the old weeping willow, 
My little one waiting for me. 
Sung by Miss IDA CoLLum. 
Gentlemen will you ROW take note, 
Of a 
young girl's heart that's broke, 
By a 
wiZ;ked minded man who carried a 
gun for Uncle Sam, 
He belongs to a 
regiment you all know well, 
To speak his name I 
am afraid to tell, 
For he looks so fair, with his light brown hair, 
And belongs to the National Guards. 
CIIORUS, 
He marched I 
am told in the National Guard so bold, 
girls all say oh don't lie look so gay, 
Tile boys look so bright, shout out with all their might, 
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah for the National Guard. 
He took me to a 
picnic one day, 
And left me there for a 
girl called May, 
And when I 
was on the ground, 
Neither of them could be found, 
I 
heard he served other girls the same, 
Now boys can you guess his name, 
And he looks so fair with his light brown hair, 
And he belongs to the National Guards.

MY MOTHER-IN-LAW 
Written and sung by BPS DODGE. 
I 
daily am growing depressed and disheartened, 
My griefs and my troubles to you 
relate; 
Dame Fortune upon me is certainly frowning, 
The cause of my sadness is my cruel fate. 
The whole of my life is o'ercast with a 
shadow, 
For all kinds of pleasure I 
don't care a 
straw; . 
It's simply because, like a 
fool, I 
got married, 
And I've got a 
bad case of a " mother-in-law." 
She comes twice every year to pay us a 
visit, 
And not stretching the truth the least mite, I 
can swear 
That each visit is fully of six months duration, 
And her presence completely fills me with despair. 
When she enters the house then my trouble commences, 
For the whole livelong day she does nothing but jaw; 
How often I've envied onr first father—Adam— 
For he wasn't cursed with a 
mother-in-law. 
Our servant girl, Sarah, is fresh from the country, 
An exceedingly good-natured and pretty young miss, 
One evening, while hugging her down in the kitchen, 
I 
thought I'd endeavor to steal a 
sly kiss. 
Said Sarsh, " Your wife would most surely be jealous, 
If she could but see us ;" I 
answered, " Oh, shaw !" 
When the door was burst open, and there stood before us 
That horrid old monster, my mother-in-law. 
The girl was discharged then and I 
soundly rated, 
For I 
couldn't lie out of the matter, of course, 
And my mother-in-law's tongue is constantly running, 
So my wife firmly vows site will have a 
divorce. 
Now our " Crack Rifle Team - 
does some nli.:tty l!ne Fitooti 
T11
,, remit of each match is always a 
draw; 
I'll give a- y

To take a

And see my friends once more, 
Things have changed a 
heap, my boy, 
Since I've been here before. 
I've traveled this wide world over and over, 
And many sights I've seen, 
But I

Better than any place I've seen.

You're never gwine to leave the old Kentucky shore, 
But stay with me and the little ones at home,

UNCLE PETER'S DREAM. 
BANJO Sow—Sung by Andy Collum. 
Old uncle Pete had a 
dream last night, 
Looking out the window he saw a 
sight, 
All about a 
story I 
am going to tell, 
Will make you all feel so well. 
Chicken in the hen-roost dancing juber, 
Monkey in the garden playing base, 
Ducks and the gander and old grey nag, 
Singing in the chorus rally round the flag. 
Owls in the tree winking, blinking, 
Cats in the pantry chasing mice, 
Bugs in the attic playing poker, 
Spider in the cobweb shaking dice. 
Chicken in the henroost drinking egg nog, 
Pig double shuffle in the sty, 
Massa swearing at the skeeters. 
Bald headed spiders coaxing flies. 
Behind the hen-house on my knees, 
I 
thought I 
heard a 
rooster sneeze, 
Sneezed so hard with the hooping cough, 
Sneezed his head and tail both off. 
Elephant up a 
gum-tree smoking his pipe, 
Bug in swimming bawling for life, 
Sally in the garden sifting peas, 
Come and kiss me if you please,

Written by R.

(A ir —" Lover's Telegraph.") 
In Baxter street there lived a 
man, 
A Chinaman, I 
mean, 
Who was dead in love with a 
black and tan. 
A coon named Susie Green ; 
This Chinaman, by name Ah Ling, 
Would fight all day for Suse, 
He went to see her every night, 
To drive away the blues. 
One night Ah Ling went to her house, 
To ask her if she'd go, 
With him unto the Chinese ball, 
But Susan answered no ; 
Says Ling " What is the reason, Sue, 
That you won't go with me ?" 
My husband said if I 
should go, 
He'd break my head," sobbed she. 
Poor Ling it almost broke his heart. 
To think that he should lose, 
The lovely one whom he adored— 
His own beloved Suse; 
Says he to her, " We'll lun away, 
And doss the sea so blue," 
They sailed away—the ship got lost, 
And that was the last of the two,"

Oh, I 
love a =him, she's fair as can be, 
Her hair is nut brown and her boot No. 3, 
-Her 2heeks are as red as the blossoming rose, 
Joy follows her footsteps wherever she goes, 
In her is all happiness earth can bestow, 
I 
can't understand why she teases me so. 
For when I 
would kiss her, this sly little puss, 
On ler lips puts her finger and answers me•thus— 
Cuonts. 
Oh, ain't you naughty, to talk to me so, 
No, I 
won't let you, now please let me go, 
I'll be " mad" and to you I'll never speak, 
You're " horrid," you're 
awful," ain't you got 
a 
cheek! 
It's awful, when for a 
caress you're inclined, 
A 
maiden should act so unjust and unkind, 
This motive alone she can have I 
am sure, 
The Dower received will be value(' the more, 
And thus they're so artful and cunning the elves, 
When we know they would " like to" as well as 
ourselves, 
And so I'm perplexed and the point 1 
can't see, 
When covered with blushes she cries out to me— 
Ciloufs.-011, ain't you naughty, to talk to me so, etc. 
Some day we'll be married, Oh, thrice happy day 
Then all affectation will be cast away, 
Then I 
shall enfold her in these loving arms, 
And shield her forever from earth's wild alarms, 
Joy, joy then shall reign in this bosom supreme, 
Life then will be real, not a 
delusive dream, 
I'll kiss her, caress her, do just as I 
please, 
And will not be amazed by such words as these—

Original by JonNsoisz & Bnuxo. 
It's now a 
hundred years ago, 
Since freedom first did dawn; 
And many a 
thought comes o'er us, 
As we hail the coming morn; 
So we'll make bold, the Scenes unfold, 
The changes from that day ; 
The battles won, the great things done, 
Since Freedom gained the day. 
We'll tell you, first, of Bunker Hill, 
There Warren met the foe 
Who wished to tax the people 
That the Tea did overthrow. 
He nobly tried, and br.tvely died, 
He well the battle won. 
And Washington, the finish gave 
To what he'd left undone. 
One hundred years since the days of Seventy-Six! 
One hundred years since we did the tyrants fix ! 
Then praise with joyful glee the banner of the free, 
And the men of Seventy-Six! (Repeat] 
Then Jackson! with his cotton bales, 
He made the red-coats fly ; 
Our banner, still triumphant, 
The invaders did defy ; 
And Lawrence fought, the lesson taught, 
Not to give up the Ship! 
And Winfield Scott, at Lundy's Lane! 
In the days of Seventy- Six!

I 
AM a 
true born Irishman, and I'll ne'er deny the same, 
I

notion to cross the ocean, to America I 
came. 
When I 
landed here, it was in the year 1862. 
I 
was willing to fight, both day and night, for the Red, White 
and the Blue, 
CHORUS. 
I 
am your Candidate for Alderman, so believe me what I 
say, 
Put on your coats, and east your votes, for me on Election day. 
When I 
started first in Polities, my friends they were but few, 
I 
can't forget, everyone I 
met, said that I 
was too "brand new." 
I 
worked the pipes on the Boulevard, along with Mickey Hart, 
He was foreman over the old sixth ward, and the owner of a 
big ash- cart. 
I 
am your candidate. Scc. 
So now my friends T 
must be off, I 
can no longer stay, 
I 
hope you wont forget to vote, for me on Election day. 
And if I 
am the lucky man, on me you may depend, 
If you want to borrow, I 
wont be sorry, for I 
am the poor- man's 
fricmd. 
I 
am your candidate, ,Icc.

N'Ve'll amuse you with a 
dance, 
And white folks tell us that in it, 
Youeau not find no harm. 
Then it's oh, my, wont we have a 
time there, 
Hands around, swing your partner, sashay, balance all, 
Oh, my, wont we cut a 
shine there, 
With Nancy Snow, and Dinah Crow, down at the husking 
The New York Lasses. 
Written and sung by HENRY CARNEY with great success. 
Oh, I'll sing in the praise of the New York young lasses— 
Such charming young creatures are they— 
For somehow or other, ' twixt one and another 
My heart has been stolen away. 
It's no use one sighing, tho' hard I 
am trying, 
I 
can't tell wherever it's gone ; 
For the great and the small ones, the short and the tall ones, 
I'm in love with them all, every one. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the New York lasses for me, 
With their hearts and their eyes full of glee ; 
I'm in love with them all, both the short and the tall, 
So the New York young lasses for me. 
Their sweet, smiling faces, as fresh as the daisies, 
Would captivate any man's heart. 
Tho' in beauty they're blooming, and quite unassuming, 
And act as they should woman's part; 
Their eyes glisten brightly, their ways are so sprightly, 
Their modesty none can surpass; 
Tho' it may perhaps look tiring, I 
can't help admiring 
Those pretty young girls as they pass. 
Oh, the New York young lasses, &c. 
They trip like the fairy, so graceful and airy, 
They look so enchanting and pure; 
• , 
At their darning and stitching they look so bewitching--
More like angels than mortals, I'm sure— 
They have such pretty features, these lovel) young creatures, 
That hearts made of stone they would break, 
If one would me marry no longer I,d tarry, 
And a 
good husband, too I 
would make. 
Oh, the New York young lasses, &e.

makes 
a 
show? 
To-morrow now they all turn out, as down Broadway they go, 
And when the Captain takes command, oh don't they make a 
show; 
With my darling on the end, with his eyes across the line, 
To keep them straight as he wheels them about, and never get 
behind. 
THEY ALL DO IT. 
Written and composed by Jonx READ. 
Arranged by H. W. FITCLIEri. 
Some folks will cry " Oh shame, Mrs. Jones, you are to blame, 
I 
never should have thought it, ma'am, of you," 
While, if they'd look at home before abroad they'd roam, 
I'm positive they'd have enough to do. 
Mrs. Brown says it's a 
sin, that Mrs. Smith drinks gin, 
And harbors " tally-men" from day to day; 
While Mrs. Green was caught doing what she hadn't ought, 
When she in self defencs was heard to say— 
CH0111.7s. 
"They all do it, they all do it, 
They all do it, though ofttimes they rue it; 
Yet they all do it, they all do it, 
And so it will continue to the end of the world!" 
For hours three or four, lovers spooning at the door, 
On any moonlight evening may be seen; 
Though if they want a 
lark, they have it in the dark, 
And they " do it," though they say " they didn't mean," 
When creeping down the stairs, comes the old man unaware; 
And kissing catch the couple in the act; 
The mother, from above, says " Don't interfere, my love, 
You can't dispute this most important fact—" 
They all do it, etc. j 
Old women do declare, girls should never dye their hair, 
And then again they say it's very wrong; 
Without the least restraint, their faces so to paint, 
And rob the easy chair for their chignon. 
Each girl a 
little puff, has inside a 
little muff, 
They are never seen without it, night or day; 
And her pretty nose she'll powder, if a 
moment is allowed her, 
When, if you laugh, she'll innocently say— 
They all do it, etc, 
tut what does most impress, is the style in which they dress, 
It's enough to make you laugh when them you see; 
They've a 
hat upon their heads, large enough to make up beds, 
For pussy cats with kittens two or three. 
In their panniers, too, behind, if examined you would find, 
The most important papers of the day; 
The Chronicle and Chimes, the Telegraph and Times, 
Or anything that chance puts in their way. 
They all do it, etc. 
There's my neighbor, Dinah Down, brught two lovely boy s 
to 
town, 
And her husband gets but one pound one per week; 
You often hear him say, " If things go on this way, 
We'll a 
lodging in the Union have to seek 
For the doctor and the nurse, will drain my scanty purse, 
With many more expenses to defray;" 
Then he gets into a 
passion, when they tell him " it's tho 
fashion," 
And they soothe him as they sing this truthful lay— 
They all do it, etc.

WHAT THE OLD COCK SPARROW SAID. 
As sung by FRANK LEWIS with immense applause. 
One day I 
took a 
walk, rambling thro' the Central Park, 
It was at the close of a 
bright Autumn day, 
To enjoy the evening breeze as it swift sped thro' the trees, 
And watch the fountain's water brightly play. 
After walking once around, a 
rustic bench I 
found, 
And sitting down a 
moment just to rest. 
When a 
voice I 
heard above, saying ' Soon to you I'll prove 
That honesty of purpose is the best.' 
As I 
looked up with surprise, a 
strange sight met my eyes, 
Some fifty sparrows gathered o'er my head; 
A big cock sparrow spoke, with age his feathers broke, 
And this was what the old cock sparrow said. 
`'Tis strange such things to hear, we are getting worse each 
year, 
The laboring man now cannot get a 
meal, 
About fifty cents a 
day is all they earn for pay, 
Its no wonder that the poor man has to steal. 
And our parsons do not preach, or longer virtue teach, 
At secret kissing they are most expert; 
And our politicians all for their living shout 
bawl, 
And talk of nothing but that bloody shirt. 
And our lecturers who roam, like naughty men from home, 
Through sleeping cars in dreams be blindly led, 
Like Tilton, sweet to furl his arms ' round some pretty girl!" 
This was part of what the old cock sparrow said. 
To the demagogues who dare talk again of civil war, 
On the Fourth of March ' twill be all right, I 
say , 
Boss Tweed is back again from that dirty land called Spain, 
And I 
hope that in confinement he'll not stay. 
For. supposing he did rob, no poor man wanted a 
job, 
He took it from the 'jell to give the poor! 
1 
1:49 
I'd rather run the risk, be ruled by men like him and Fisk, 
For then no b6ggars hungered at your door. 
Of such things soon well tire, look at the great Brooklyn fire; 
They condemned the theatres—when the folks were dead! 
Had they done it but before, we should not the fire deplore"— 
This was part of what the old cock sparrow said. 
"In the election long since gone, none knows which man has 
won, 
They did the " counting" just themselves to please; 
Let Returning Boards act fair, and do things on the square, 
And we care nof if it's Tilden or it's haves. 
But one thing we must see, in this land so great and free, 
That work in plenty shall be got for all; 
And the scoundrels who would lower the wages of the poor, 
Now quickly we will send them to the walll" 
At this a 
shout did rise, which ascended to the skies, 
From the sparrows that did flutter o'er my head ; 
They said his words were right, as they flew into the night, 
And they voted all the old cock sparrow said.

We march in style and the ladies all smile, 
And call us their littie dears, 
When we get out upon parade 
With the Isaac Musketeers. 
CHORUS. 
You should see us on Proadway when we do march so gay, 
The people shout and holler out we are queers ; 
But we don't care for that, for we are getting fat 
Since we joined the Solomon Isaac Musketeers. 
Now when the fighting time does come, 
We'll show what we can do ; 
We'll destroy a

And then we won't look queer;

With its brilliant, sparkling zest; 
And the days are fast approaching 
When our dearest joy is rest. 
We have tasted many pleasures, 
And their fragrance lingers yet, 
But I 
mark amid your tresses 
Snowy strands among the jet.

Roses in your dark hair set;

We have laughed, our mirth was gay; 
We have sung and danced and flirted 
As our youth fled fast away. 
But the dance must end, my darling, 
Let it pass without regret ; 
Time has placed his hand upon us, 
Snowy strands among the jet. 
You have worn, etc. 
Let us not for joys departed 
Grieve our souls with mournful thought; 
Truer pleasures are before us,

THE tivitLnm's OF IRttAND. 
As sung by W ILL H . 
Moreroiz, America's Coruique, at the Academy of 
Music, Chicago, Ill. 
I 
wear two lovely emblems, 
I 
wear them on my breast, 
The harp entwined with shamrock 
Is the emblem I 
love best, 
They're symbols of old Erin, 
The place that gave me birth, 
The sacred spot of Erin 
Is the dcarest spot on earth. 
CnoRns. 
The harp and the shamrock of Erin, 
The harp and the shamrock for me, 
When ' ere my voice I 
raise I'll always sing in praise 
Of the harp and shamrock of Erin. 
When I 
see a 
bunch of shamrocks 
I 
think of St. Patrick's day, 
And if I 
hear its tune struck up, 
It makes my heart feel gay, 
My spirit overcomes me, 
And on Erin sweet I 
call, 
Just touch the harp of Erin, 
And I'll sing Tara's Ilall. 
(Chorus). 
The old stone cross of Ireland, 
Is an emblem great and grand, 
With the wolf dog resting calmly 
Near the round towers of our land, 
Their relics dear to Irishmen, 
No matter where I 
roam, 
Good men are always firm and true 
To emblems of their own. 
(Chorus). 
In August last, on one fine day, 
A 
bobbing around, around, around, 
When Josh and I 
went to make hay, 
We went bobbing around, 
Says Josh to me let's take a 
walk, 
A 
bobbing around, around, around, 
Then we can have a 
talk, 
As we go bobbing around. 
We walked along to the mountain ridge, 
A 
bobbing around, around, around, 
Till we got near Squire Slipshop's bridge, 
As we went bobbing around. 
Then Josh and I 
went on a 
spree, 
A 
bobbing around, around, around, 
And I 
kiss'd Josh, and Josh kiss'd me, 
As we went bobbing around, 
Then Josh's pluck no longer tarried, 
A 
bobbing around, around, around, 
Says he dear Patience let's get married, 
Then we'll go bobbing around. 
Now I 
knew he lov'd another gal, 
A 
bobbing around, around, around, 
They call'd her long legg'd crook'd shin, curly 
tooth'd Sal, 
When he went bobbing around. 
So after we got into church, 
A 
bobbing around, aroun.., arottna, 
I 
cut and left Josh in the lurch, 
Then he went bobbing around. 
So all you chaps what's got a 
gal, 
A 
bobbing around, around, around, 
Do think of long legg'd crook'd shin, curly 
tooth'd Sal, 
When you go bobbing around. 
THE OLD HOME, 
As done by BILLY and M AGGIE RAY. 
I'VE wandered very far away, 
From the clime where I 
was born. 
And my al heart has grown so sad, 
Dejected and forlorn; 
No master kind to treat me well, 
To cheer me when in pain, 
I 
want to see the cotton fields, 
And the dear old home again, 
CHORUS. 
Oh I 
the good old times am past an0 gone, 
I 
sigh for them in vain, 
I 
want to Sr,2 the cotton fields, 
And the dear old home again. 
I'm left alone to wander now, 
When my days am very few, 
Both wife and children now am gone, 
I 
don't know what to do; 
Old master too, he may be dead, 
His hair was turning gray, 
Oh 
let me see that ear old horns, 
Before I 
pass away. 
Oh! the good old times, etc.

Oh, my name is Mike Duffy, I 
came from Galore, 
I 
have a 
large family so I 
opened a 
store. 
I 
hired the whole house and the gang knew me well, 
And the name that they gave it was the Bummer's Hotel. 
CHORUS. 
Cause it's one cent for coffee, it's two cents for Dread, 
It's three cents for a 
steak, and it's five for a 
bed, 
The breeze from the gutter brings a 
salt water smell 
To the political guests of the Bummer's Hotel. 
Oh, there is fat Kate O'Grady puts your name on the book, 
She is head chambermaid and chief pastry-cook, 
She make fine rat pies, like hot cakes they do sell. 
On the Europeon plan is the Bummer's Hotel. 
'Cause it's one cent, etc 
Oh, we ave ninety-one boarders, we are packed to the door, 
They pay five cents and then spit on the floor, 
They fetch in stale lager of murders they tell. 
Delmonico's Is no where near the Bummer's Hotel. 
'Cause it's one cent, etc.

Written expressly for P. H. CARMODY, and sung by him with auccoas. 
Through respect to her boarders ould Mrs. McGee

It was hailed with delight, and St. Patrick's night 
Was proposed and accepted to have the soiree. 
With arrangements perfected, the committee selected, 
Floor-manager fell to Sylvester McCann, 
And Archibald Cusick, the Mozart of Music, 
Who plays on the boarding-house organ so grand.

There was cobblers and tailors, kalsominers and grainer, 
Mechanics and tradesmen of no mean degree; 
There was grapers and trampers and pure red-eye samplers, 
At the boarding-house party of Mrs. McGee. 
Mr. J. H. O'Grady, the artistic grainer, 
Was asked for a 
song of the rale Irish stock; 
He 'd 
in red-eye been dinging, so in humor for singing, 
Requested a 
cane, and he d 
sing them the " Crock." 
You talk of canaries and birds of the prairie, 
His melodious strains they would envy the thrush. 
In antics and prantics he's quite elegantic; 
He's wasting his time with a 
paint pot and brush. 
Cnouus.—There was cobblers, etc. 
The next to respond was a 
tall son of Erin, 
Who recited a 
poem from Boliver Flood. 
His name it is Barry,—he the pitcher does carry,— 
And is president, pro-tern, of the " Bursting-Up Club." 
He fought like a 
hero at the battle of " Chronic," 
And escaped all its dangers without wound or scar. 
He's a

Method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
be meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Idany young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
Sedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of quostions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affection', which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
