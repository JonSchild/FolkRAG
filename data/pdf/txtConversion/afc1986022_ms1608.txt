INF: Well, one thing you're not crowded. And then another thing people's fairly honest they
haven't got the big city way of life yet. You have your friends. About twenty five percent of
them you can believe what they tell you. And in the big cities well they don't have time to
talk to you. Here you can get your shotgun, walk out the door and go hunting.
FW: Yeah.
INF: Big town you' got to drive fifty miles.
FW: Or further.
INF: Then shoot somebody's cow or something. Come back and say you killed a deer.
FW: Yeah, I guess you're right about that.
INF: Out in Tuckford County they were hunt one time and one of these city dudes was up
there with about a two-hundred dollar outfit on, about a five-hundred dollar rifle, and snow
on the ground. And he tracked a man's horse for two miles and shot it and thought he'd
killed

FW: Oh, no what ever happened to him? Did anything happen to him?
INF: No, nothing happened to him, he eat the horse.
FW: I know you guys is bad to tell some stories cause I've heard Bill sit around and tell
some stories. Tall tales or not.
INF: Then me and an other guy was hunt one time I think this guy had an old horse it was
about ready to die. And he told me that he'd let us hunt, I went to the house and talked to
him, and he says well, I'll let you hunt, he says I've got an old horse way back up yonder
in the field. And he says it's just like one of the family. It's too old to eat and too old to work
and I don't want to kill it. He says I'll let you hunt if you'll kill that old horse up there. A way
off from the house. So I went back and told that guy that I guess that fellow said he wasn't
to friendly about it but he said we could hunt. So we hunted a pretty good while and didn't
see nothing but that old horse. So I told him I said I just think I'll shoot that fellow's old
horse. and I just cracked down on it and killed it.
FW: What did your friend say?
INF: Oh, he liked to had a fit he said my God you done killed that man's horse. Don't you
tell nobody a beacuse...
FW: Oh, no. Didn't you ever feel bad about it? Did you ever tell him any different?

INF: Oh anybody can catch a mink But he's been wanting me to go down there on the
creek with him and help him trap. I don't know whether to waste my time on him or not. But
they're not hard to kill.
FW: Well it must have been something special about catching a mink.
INF2: You got to know what you're doing.
FW: Why, what do you do?
INF: Well they're just a little smarter than a muskrat. People catch
Tape no. 146 p. 11
'em and the mink are smarter. Smarter than the guy that's trapped for <unintelligible text>
usually.
FW: Well what do you have to do special?
INF: Well, follow them in the snow for about five years and see where they go to when
the snow's on the ground. And then you know how to set for them, where to set your trap.
Follow them for about five years, year in and year out, you know where they go.

FW: Don't they smell you?
INF2: Their habits.
INF: Their habits. To kill anything to be successful at killing any kind of game or trapping
anything you've got to know their habits. And once you learn their habits everything has a
weakness. Even humans. And once you learn their weakness well then you've got them
whipped.
INF2: You figure on the average what they're going to do.
INF: What they'll do nine times out of ten. What they'll do. They don't always do what you
figured they would.
FW: Well don't they smell you though when you set the trap?
INF: Well you die and wax your trap and you use rubber gloves. You wade the creek with
hip boots on, make the trap and then you wash everything off with water after you've set it
and there's no scent there for them to smell.
FW: Sounds like a lot of trouble for one mink.
INF: Well if you get enough of them though you've got enough to go turkey hunting on.
INF2: That's what he's doing now, trapping.
