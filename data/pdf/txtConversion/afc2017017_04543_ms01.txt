[00:00:51] (SM) No 
[00:00:54] (KS) What address shall we use for you, to contact you? 
[00:00:58] (SM) 23595 Winery Lane, Middleburg 20117 
[00:01:16] (KS) And email? 
[00:01:18] (SM) I will give you my personal email: sebxxx@xxx 
[00:01:30] (KS) And phone number? 
[00:01:32] (SM) 571-XXX-XXX 
[00:01:39] (KS) Your date of birth? 
[00:01:40] (SM) XXX, 1972 
[00:01:47] (KS) So then you are 
[00:01:48] (SM) 45 
[00:01:50] (KS) I’m 44, so that one I could figure out. And what would you say your different 
jobs are? Or job? 
[00:01:58] (SM) Well I’m winemaker and for Greenhill I’m also Chief Commercial Officer. 
[00:02:16] (KS) What does that entail? 
[00:02:18] (SM) Well I’m responsible for the direction of business. What I really do, I’m an 
expert in the wine industry because I’ve worked in it for more than 30 years. I’ve been producing 
wine since 1989. So what I really do it’s help wineries to establish their business, winery owners 
to found the right piece of land for them. Also help winery to select the best grape variety. So it’s 
a pretty wide range of service that I offer for the term of consulting. 
[00:03:25] (KS) Would you consider yourself sort of a consultant in that you go to different 
wineries and do this? 
[00:03:31] (SM) I have business consulting. Consulting since 2011. I also have a wine laboratory 
and I do all the chemical analysis for the wine industry to be able to produce better wine. And 
I’m also working full time for Greenhill Winery, since the new building, to help them to quick 
return on their business. 
[00:04:04] (KS) So, is there a title for your other company? 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

[00:04:08] (SM) Yes, Burgundy Style Consulting 
[00:04:17] (KS) But right now your focus is on Greenhill? 
[00:04:19] (SM) No, I also make wine for Doukenie Winery right now. I’m also making wine for 
another winery called Seven Oaks Farm. 
 
[00:04:38] (KS) Is that a newer one? 
 
[00:04:40] (SM) Yes, they are building their own building this year. They already own the 
property and the house and the vineyard there, so they will be building a production area there 
this year. Also I work with Bozzo Family Vineyard. It’s a new winery on Route 9. I planted their 
vineyard three years ago. We start producing wine just now because vineyards start to produce 
grapes. So it will be opening in the next six weeks. 
 
[00:05:33] (KS) So that’s the average for grapes when you go planting it takes about three years 
to get going? 
 
[00:05:38] (SM) Correct. Three to four years for the first crop. 
 
[00:05:46] (KS) So, do most vineyards then get off the ground with buying grapes to establish 
themselves or do they wait until their own grapes are grown? 
 
[00:06:00] (SM) You have different possibilities. Some people are patient enough and say okay, 
I’ll just wait until my grapes grow because I believe in them and I don’t want to outsource my 
product to another piece of land. So that point is possible. And some other winery want to start 
producing a little bit quicker, so they have to do a special demand to TB to use somebody else’s 
grapes before their own grapes produce to be able to produce wine before they open. So different 
possibilities depending on owner decision. Some people need a quicker return on investment, so 
they want to purchase grapes to be able to produce wine quicker and some others like to be 
patient and rather use only the grapes from their estate than produce wine from the next estate. 
By law, wineries can use 51%, if you have a farm winery license you must use 51% of the grapes 
from your estate. 
 
[00:07:08] (KS) From your estate, does that mean the single property or all of your holdings? 
[00:07:13] (SM) All of your properties. All of your holdings. That is federal law. 
[00:07:21] (KS) So is that part of when they had the lawsuit to allow direct to consumer sales in 
Virginia for wine? 
 
[00:07:30] (SM) So that is different. In America, since Prohibition we have a three-tier system. 
That means it’s not legal for a producer to sell wine directly to a retailer. So you have to have a 
middleman and a distributor. We need to carry the wine to the extremities of the market. So I 
think it was Swedenburg Winery - I don’t remember the first name now of who owned that 
Winery Workers in Virginia

property specifically – they went to court to fight that right, to the Supreme Court. And she won, 
so wineries were now able to sell wine and ship wine out of states directly to consumers. 
 
[00:08:32] (KS) And across state lines. 
 
[00:08:33] (SM) Correct. Under certain specifics. We have to respect states laws. So some states 
impose certain tax. 
 
[00:08:53] (KS) So it’s determined state by state. 
[00:08:55] (SM) Correct 
[00:08:56] (KS) I was recently at a conference and there were different distilleries and breweries 
and wineries that are popping up in other states and initially they had to overcome the issue of 
having to go through a distributor. Even just to sell their own product to the customer they would 
have to sell it wholesale and then buy it back. 
 
[00:09:17] (SM) Well in Maryland it was like that. Maryland was maybe the most specific 
because only Maryland state was the distributor. So only Maryland state was buying the wine 
from the producers and every retailer had to buy it from the state. It was a way for the state to 
produce some revenues, but it made farmers have a hard time to sell to a distributor. So we had a 
lot of conflict in terms of sales there. But now they are a little bit more flexible. So now we are 
finally able to ship our wine to Maryland customers directly, though we have to respect certain 
volume and pay some fees for that. 
 
[00:10:08] (KS) So it’s still not as open 
 
[00:10:08] (SM) It’s still not as easy, but it’s possible. So we’re working. Pennsylvania is also 
working for us to be able to sell to 
 
[00:10:19] (KS) They have very strange liquor laws in Pennsylvania. 
 
[00:10:23] (SM) Pennsylvania, Utah, Maryland, always difficult states to work with. And it 
impacts us a lot. We’re in Virginia, so we have a straight line between Maryland. So to be able to 
sell wine to our neighbors. Specifically we’re in Middleburg. Maryland is only 30 miles away or 
40 miles away. That is very restrictive in terms of business, because a lot of clients drive from 
Maryland to visit us. At this point they can buy the wine when they come on site, but by law it 
was not legal before to ship the wine to them. Now it is. So they can sign the wine club on site. 
 
[00:11:07] (KS) Yeah, my mother, when she first moved to Virginia in the 70s, 60s, the laws 
were so restrictive about alcohol, everyone would drive to DC to get alcohol and then they would 
stop on the Key Bridge to check cars to see if they were buying. That’s why there’s all those 
liquor stores right on the end of Key Bridge. Even it was illegal for a woman in DC to carry a 
drink in a bar for herself. So you’re in a bar and you’re having dinner and you want to take a 
drink to 
Winery Workers in Virginia

[00:11:40] (SM) It was not legal 
 
[00:11:42] (KS) You would be considered, I don’t know, a prostitute or something. Something 
crazy. And they would be like, no no no no no ma’am, let us put it on a tray and carry it for you. 
Isn’t that crazy? Anyway, so I know it’s been a long time coming for Virginia. 
 
[00:12:00] (SM) Yeah, it will be so wonderful for the wineries to be able to sell wine where they 
want without. You know, in France a winery can sell wine to a restaurant directly. And I think 
it’s a direct, normal way for the producer to generate a little bit more profit. Because the fact is, 
when we sign a deal with a distributor, when we sign or just touch hands, in Virginia when you 
touch hands with a distributor you agree to have them carry your wine, it’s a live contract. So if 
he doesn’t sell wine during that time, it’s almost impossible or very difficult to get your label 
back. That’s why it’s so difficult for a producer to sell wine and agree with a distributor, because 
they own your brand at that point. So they buy your wine 60% discount and they make more 
profit than yourself. The distributor is making more profit than the producer. 
 
[00:13:12] (KS) So then if you don’t like the way they’re handling your brand. 
 
[00:13:15] (SM) At this point it’s complicated. You have to get a release. Your brand has to be 
released from the distributor. 
 
[00:13:20] (KS) It sounds like almost how the music labels work. Like Prince trying to get out of 
Warner Brothers or something like that. That’s crazy. I didn’t know it was so 
 
[00:13:29] (SM) So you have to prove, you have to have a lawyer write a nice letter proving that 
he did not provide the service that you agreed to. So that means that you have to have a very 
good lawyer writing your letter asking them to release your wine, your brand. Like, I see that 
you’re only selling 20 cases a year, so I ask you to release my brand because you are not 
providing the service that you’re supposed to. At this point, if not, you can negotiate. They can 
say, no if you want your brand back you can sign me a check for $200,000 or $50,000 or 
whatever. You can negotiate the release of your brand. 
 
[00:14:13] (KS) Has this had a lot to do with the shaping of the Virginia wine industry? Because 
I think many of the wineries don’t even try to get distribution. 
 
[00:14:21] (SM) Well that is one of the reasons. First we don’t have a lot of wine. That is the 
first reason. We are able to sell direct, so many of the wineries don’t produce a lot. They have 
small size vineyards, so they’d rather focus on selling direct, with a producer-to-person profit 
margin, than to try to sell wine to distributor at 60% discount. So the demand is not, for wine is 
not very large. That is the first reason. The second reason is the difficulty to be released. If you 
sign with a distributor and want to take your brand back you have a lot of difficulties to get it 
back. So why not focus on selling direct instead to sell to a distributor. So that is the second 
reason why. 
 
[00:15:12] (KS) And then, because I think that’s what sets the Virginia wine industry apart from 
other wine industries in the US. Especially in California you see much bigger distribution 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

networks for those wine than you see for Virginia wines. And if they do have them carried in 
restaurants or stores it tends to be very limited relationships. Like specific places or specific 
stores. 
 
[00:15:40] (SM) Well, it’s also the volume. California I think it’s 85% of production in the 
United States. Virginia is less than 1%. 
 
[00:15:53] (KS) How do you think that’s going to be affected by, say the fires by Napa and 
Sonoma? 
 
[00:16:00] (SM) By Sonoma that brand represents only 5% of California production, the Central 
Valley. Sonoma and Napa seems to be a good, big sized production, but I think it’s only 5 or 7% 
of California production. So there it will be impacted. There’s no question about it. Because it 
really a higher end. It’s a high end product. They carry the flag with the quality of their product 
there. They will be impacted for sure. The fires started when 25% of the crop was still outside on 
the vine. 75% of the product was already harvested, so that is very protected. 25% was still on 
the vine, so the 2017 batch will be impacted. Now it’s how to rebuild this vineyard. There is no 
assessment that has been done yet. No one knows how many acres have been burned, what is the 
condition of the vines. How we will be able to save the vines to produce. We don’t have data yet. 
It’s too early. 
 
[00:17:13] (KS) Has there been situations where there’s been a big fire in a wine producing 
region and you could tell that the vintages that come after that are they better, are they worse? 
Does the fire help? 
 
[00:17:25] (SM) Not that I know. I don’t think it would be better because when the vine burns 
pretty deeply you have to trim back, retrain the vines, produce from scratch, so 
 
[00:17:45] (KS) But you know they say that fire is good for soil. We’ll see. Let me get back to 
some more specific things for you. With your work at Greenhill what are you doing? What’s 
your day to day work that you’re doing now? 
 
[00:18:12] (SM) Well first for the past two months the focus was to try to produce the best wine 
possible. So a lot of vineyard work focused to determine the date of harvest. Since mid-August I 
was going to a vineyard every week to try to test the grape’s sugar concentration, pH, and all the 
different characteristics to make sure that the grapes were ripening correctly. So that, since 
August, was really what I was focusing on. When you pick the grapes you decide to harvest the 
grapes because the data, the chemistry is balanced. You have the green, the brown seeds, the 
seeds turn brown from green. You know then the colors, the berries, the quality is here to be 
picked. At this point you send the picker to harvest the grapes by hand. Here, in the South, at 
Greenhill we have another property near Emmers County, between Lynchburg and 
Charlottesville. We have another 75 acres property there. So since the summer was pretty dry 
and the weather did break pretty early as well, we did harvest 15 days earlier there than usual. So 
that was I think wonderful for us, because we were able to pick all these grapes that were already 
ripe before the rain of mid-September. Always we have storms, but this year we did not have to 
deal with that from the grapes down south. What was very surprising, there was very cool nights 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

and warm days, so all the grapes almost ripened at the same time down South. So that was very 
easy, picking the grapes, lining up the crew, sending the trucks to pick up the grapes and bring 
the grapes back to the winery. At that time the wine making job really started, so we had to 
process all the grapes, select the best yeast for each lot. You know, for Merlot we use a different 
yeast than the Cabernet Sauvignon, than the Chardonnay. So we had to select a different yeast 
and start the process to produce the best wine possible. 
 
[00:21:05] (KS) So all the processing happens up here though, in this facility. How do you get 
your yeasts? 
 
[00:21:15] (SM) The yeasts we purchase, commercial yeast. You have a lot of different wine 
labs in the world who are producing different types of yeast with different specificities. So if you 
want some for Chardonnay, for instance. If you want some specific Chardonnay style, I use some 
yeast which are harvested from Burgundy. So they harvest yeast in Burgundy, select them, test 
them, multiply them, dehydrate them, and package them and sell them to us. 
 
[00:22:01] (KS) There’s a whole yeast farm. 
 
[00:22:02] (SM) Exactly, yeast farm is a saccharomyces type of yeast, but that gene comes from 
the Burgundy region. So that’s a very specific aspect that you will get in your wine. 
 
[00:22:17] (KS) So is that yeast a naturally occurring yeast from Burgundy? 
[00:22:20] (SM) Correct 
[00:22:21] (KS) Or could it also just be, I guess the yeast hangs around from past. 
 
[00:22:27] (SM) Correct. So this is what they do. They go around in Burgundy and scrape some 
old stone walls in the old wineries and they go in a microscope and separate them and test the 
genes and multiply them and at this point you as a young wine maker you can use hundreds of 
thousands of years of yeast that have been multiplied and selected and can be used. 
 
[00:22:50] (KS) That’s wild. I never thought about yeast farming as an actual business. 
[00:22:56] (SM) Yes it is. It’s a big business because they use that for bread as well. 
[00:22:59] (KS) Sure, cheeses. 
[00:23:02] (SM) Exactly, so for us we go with default lab and they send us their fancy magazine 
with fancy yeasts, their catalogue, and we pick the yeasts that we like and we purchase the yeast 
that we think will work the best with the desires and objectives. So each yeast has different 
alcohol resistance, so you have to follow the specifics and make sure that they are performing the 
best. 
 
[00:23:42] (KS) Is the climate quite similar to Burgundy? 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

[00:23:47] (SM) Burgundy is hot and dry summers, but can have some storms in there as well, 
but it’s pretty cold winters. I would say here it’s a bit more humid, except this year it was pretty 
dry in the summer. 
 
[00:24:04] (KS) Do you think that will be good for your wines? 
[00:24:06] (SM) Yes 
[00:24:09] (KS) Because it will be more concentrated sugars. 
 
[00:24:13] (SM) And aromatics. Color and also aromatics will be more concentrated as well. 
[00:24:22] (KS) So the humidity is the biggest challenge here in Virginia? 
[00:24:26] (SM) Yes. 
 
[00:24:30] (KS) So what do you do about that? It is just kind of the way it is here. 
 
[00:24:34] (SM) Well what we do is a lot of vineyard techniques we can put in place to reduce 
issues with grapes rotting. We spend a lot of time managing the canopy of the vineyard to try to 
open the canopy to try to make sure that we don’t have a cocoon of humidity inside the leaves. 
We also remove, so pruning in the winter. When we do all of the pruning in the winter we need 
to leave space between future shoots to have enough air between the clusters. 
 
[00:25:20] (KS) So you don’t want things laying on top of each other. 
 
[00:25:24] (SM) Correct. We have this tracing system, so we have this wire system we can attach 
the vine to it and the space between the next cluster will be not overlapping and getting too much 
humidity into it. That’s the first thing we do. The second thing is we remove also leaves from the 
cluster. So we send the workers in the vineyard to remove the leaves. We have a machine also 
that can cut the leaves from the cluster to try to expose the cluster to sunlight. So we start with 
the East side first. On the East side we remove the leaves from the clusters so when the sun rises 
it’s facing the sun in the morning and drying quicker, those clusters, so we have less humidity on 
the cluster in the morning. 
 
[00:26:16] (KS) So what time of year is that done usually? 
[00:26:19] (SM) We try to do that end of June and July. 
[00:26:25] (KS) When it’s starting to really heat up. 
[00:26:27] (SM) Yes. We don’t want to do it too late, because we expose our grapes to sunburn. 
We want to do it when the sun is not too strong and the berries can handle the sunlight, all the 
UV. I was looking at the data that I pooled for the year and July 2017 US wineries counted by 
states, Virginia is #6 in terms of wineries count. We have 270 wineries in Virginia. So we are #6 
in the nation in terms of wineries count.

[00:27:11] (KS) So who’s ahead of us? California 
[00:27:14] (SM) 4,240. Washington 753. 
[00:27:19] (KS) Oregon I would think. 
 
[00:27:20] (SM) 724. New York 380. Texas 294. And after us, just after us Pennsylvania with 
250. 
 
[00:27:31] (KS) Wow, I didn’t realize that they had that many. 
 
[00:27:36] (SM) All the Fingers Lakes. Oh, Pennsylvania, yeah I didn’t know either, but they 
seem to have a lot. 
 
[00:27:40] (KS) Yeah, well I know they’re doing it now, even in Michigan. It’s up there too. 
 
[00:27:45] (SM) Yeah, Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina, Missouri, Colorado, Illinois. And that is 
interesting, because we are #5 in terms of wineries. I think we are only #11 in terms of 
production. No, #9 sorry. 
 
[00:28:15] (KS) So do you see that there’s a possibility for much more wine production in 
Virginia, or do you think that this is probably as much 
 
[00:28:23] (SM) I think that it will grow. I believe that the wine industry will grow. First, 
because wine consumption increased every year for the past 30 years in America. If you compare 
with France, America, I believe today, annual consumption is 12 liters per year per person. In 
France it is 45. So French people were drinking 110 liters per year per person 30 years ago. They 
decreased their consumption to 45 liters per year per person. So they drink less, but they drink 
better. So before they were drinking 11% alcohol wine every day for lunch and dinner. Today 
they don’t drink alcohol during the week. It’s pretty rare. They drink a good bottle of wine 
during the weekend. So consumption really decreased drastically in France. In America I think 
we are still only at 12 liter per year per person and the consumption did not stop increasing for 
30 years. So I would say that an American will be drinking as much wine as France. I believe so. 
Yes. I cannot imagine why not. Will the French consumption decrease more in the future? I do 
not think so. I think it will be pretty stable in terms of consumption. So all the states of the 
United States that are producing good quality wine, that is really what will determine the fate of 
Virginia, is the quality of the product and the price To be able to satisfy the demand you need to 
be good first, consistently. You cannot have one good year and five bad. Most people need 
consistency. You can have one bad year from time to time, like that happened in Bordeaux or 
Burgundy, but you must be good consistently. You need to be competitive. Because today the 
world wine market is very competitive. You can buy wine from South America in America. You 
can buy French wine in America. You can buy any wine. 
 
[00:30:49] (KS) New Zealand, Australia 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

[00:30:50] (SM) Exactly, the competition is worldwide, so you have to be good and you have to 
be competitive in terms of price. In Virginia the challenge is the price. It costs more money to 
grow grapes in Virginia than it costs in California. I would say it costs three times more. 
 
[00:31:09] (KS) Do you think part of it is, it’s sort of bananas that this is the area where all the 
wineries are, because it’s so expensive here. This is really expensive, but it’s also within quick 
driving distance for tourists to come, but we could be producing a lot of wine in areas where they 
used to grow tobacco and all of these kinds of things. Do you think that that’s the push that will 
be more towards expanding acreage in maybe the southwest of Virginia? 
 
[00:31:45] (SM) I know the Shenandoah Woodland is cheaper. I know a lot of people are 
purchasing land there to plant vineyards. So I believe the location of wineries will be, yes, in this 
area, because you have more traffic. You have proximity with Washington DC. 
 
[00:32:01] (KS) The consumers are here. 
 
[00:32:03] (SM) The consumers are here. So I believe that a big percentage of wineries will be 
located in this area. Yes. And production can be located somewhere else. The land, the extreme 
high price of land here also will be limiting, you know the development of agriculture. 
 
[00:32:20] (KS) Definitely. I mean, it’s been interesting. Previous to this project I did a project 
with farmers who have pick your own apple farms and peaches. There’s quite a lot of similarity 
really, because they’re able to sell directly to consumers. They don’t have to worry about 
distribution networks as much, but they have some the complications of having a farm business 
with the customers coming to your property. For example, when your company here decided just 
this year to being 21 and over, I’m assuming that was impacted by the behavior of some of the 
customers. 
 
[00:33:04] (SM) Correct. I have a couple of reasons why we did that. Yes, that is a good subject 
because it is great for us to be in a very populated area, because that helps us to sell our product 
direct. But also, bother, certain people don’t like to have traffic in their neighborhood. I think 
that will be a challenge we’ll have in the future, and we already have a challenge with a couple 
of wineries who have been pushed back by neighbors, because it’s agricultural land, but people 
don’t want agriculture around them. Specifically wineries, because they bring people driving on 
the weekends and it’s true that some roads that are asphalt, or gravel still, so in the summer when 
it’s dusty and no rain, people are complaining that their roads which were quiet before have a lot 
of traffic on it. So, that impacts a little the peace that they had before. So we’ll see where the 
county wants to take us, or the state, where they want to take the agriculture and the product and 
winery industry. So that will be one of the challenge we will have, and the county will have also. 
You know, how do we balance it to make it more friendly for people and not impact the 
development of the wine industry. 
 
[00:34:36] (KS) Yeah, that’s a big thing and then it’s a bit of a privilege to have that farm 
business status for tax reasons and a lot of other reasons. One thing I know that the farmers that I 
worked with were concerned about, they didn’t want to seem to be in violation of the parameters 
of that license, but at the same time they want to take care of the people when they come to the 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

farm. They want to be able to have food and water and treats for the kids and maybe some games 
and things that they can do and then it starts to get blurry for what part of it is the agricultural 
business and what part of it is now just an entertainment venue. 
 
[00:35:26] (SM) This is also why being a winery we decided to be 21 and older. Some customers 
are treating our farm wineries like a public park. They come on our public land with their 
blanket, picnic, cooler, speaker, sports game, sometimes bring other alcohol other than our 
license permits us, so we have to police them. We cannot have any other alcohol on our winery 
license without special request, so we have to police people not to bring outside alcohol on our 
premises. And they are going to spend the full afternoon here drinking one or two bottles of 
wine, with kids running around, letting them loose, and we are a farm, so we have cattle, we 
have horses, we have bees, and we cannot have children, with no control, climbing trees, 
throwing rocks, and with parents who are drinking sometimes too much, so we have to police 
parents as well sometimes. So this is the reason why we decided to stop that and say no. We are 
selling alcohol. We want a peaceful environment. Our philosophy is to produce hand crafted, 
high end product, and we don’t want to impact the experience that other wine aficionados can 
have when they visit our wineries. So this is, I think, a difficult decision that we have to take. We 
still have some very terrible reviews on yelp. If you look we just had one thirty minutes ago. A 
lady who is really unhappy, because children cannot be part of the experience. It’s interesting 
that people judge us for a policy that we have to put in place more than about the quality we are 
offering in our wine. So, that shows that the vision of the wine industry is not just a wine 
industry, but it is also a service industry and people expect the best service possible and that 
changes a little bit with farm agriculture than what we used to, you know a farm with two person 
working and no public. So we are discovering a new way of doing business. I think it is new in 
Virginia for sure. 
 
[00:38:14] (KS) They definitely have very similar issue with people acting wrong, not watching 
their kids, even stealing. They have a lot of problems with stealing in the orchards with people, 
you know they bring their purse or something and they put all the fruit in there. Or a baby stroller 
and it’s all full of apples. 
 
[00:38:37] (SM) We had an article, I don’t remember what magazine, but Jennifer Brewer, 
Brewer winery was giving some examples of people stealing stuff in wineries. We’ve seen it 
here. People come to do a tasting, they purchase a bottle of wine, they go sit outside on the green 
space, and they leave with the glass. I put a basket outside. If I can save 10% of the glass that 
people are taking away from us it’s a victory. Because where do you go? Are you going to a 
restaurant and taking a glass when you leave? Are you to a bar and leave with your empty glass 
of beer? No, we don’t see that. But it’s become common in the wine industry. People come and 
drink wine and leave with the glass. 
 
[00:39:26] (KS) Do you think maybe it’s because they’re familiar with places where they want 
you to take the glass and they just assume? 
 
[00:39:33] (SM) But still they should ask. When people come at the tasting room to do a tasting 
we disclose to them the price, we disclose the volume of wine they will have, but we never tell 
them the glass is free. We also never tell them that they will get a refund on their tasting if they 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
11
purchase some wine. I know some wineries do, but we don’t and people maybe they assume, but 
I don’t think they assume. I think they like a glass with our logo on it and want to build a 
collection at home of glasses from different wine places they went. And when you increase the 
price of tasting just a little bit to cover the staff of the wine who are doing the tasting, plus the 
glass now, but for sure a tasting is not $10 anymore, it is $14, because I cannot just lose glasses 
all the time. 
 
[00:40:25] (KS) At Naked Mountain he was telling me that they have been taking the glasses so 
much. I think they actually stopped putting the logo on the glass, because they thought maybe 
they wouldn’t take them, but they’re still taking them, and even they’ve taken a lamp, from the 
tasting room that was sitting on a table. 
 
[00:444] (SM) Yeah we see that as well. They take wine, bottle of wine. We have some piece of 
furniture with wine, just to decorate our building. Sometimes the wine is not good, because it is 
here for a couple of years, in the sunlight, but people are taking the wine. People are taking stuff. 
We had soap from the toilet dispenser disappear. So this is a thing. I don’t know what else. So 
yes, we did remove the logo as well, at one point. But still we see people taking the glass. So I 
say, I would rather have them to have my logo at home. It’s advertising, than just take the glass 
with no logo on it. It’s crazy, it’s crazy, it’s crazy. 
 
[00:41:46] (KS) How long have you been working in Virginia total? 
[00:41:50] (SM) Ten years. 
[00:41:52] (KS) When you first came here you came and worked with Doukenie Winery. 
[00:42:00] (KS) Why did you decide to stay in Virginia. 
[00:42:05] (SM) A couple of reasons, the first reason is my son was in Martinique, in the 
Caribbean Islands, so it was the closest wine region to Martinique. 
 
[00:42:15] (KS) Oh yeah, I think you told me that before. 
 
[00:42:19] (SM) From Dulles airport you can fly to Martinique in three hours and a half and I 
was able to keep contact with my six years old son at that time. That was just wonderful, because 
I was in California for five years prior that and when I separated from his mother it was very 
hard for me. For one year I saw him once and it was impossible. I couldn’t live like that. So I 
moved to Virginia for that first reason. And the second reason is really the fact that it was a 
growing region. A lot of wineries popping up everywhere. And I came first to discover the place 
and I really found that the potential was here. So Doukenie winery was having a small vineyard 
established in place already and I know that I can bring them to the next level in terms of wine 
making. And I helped them to build the brand as well there. I became general manager for them 
and it was a good fit for me at that point, because Virginia needed a trained wine maker with 
knowledge of the industry, so it was a perfect time for me to come here. In 2009 I think my son 
decided to come back and live with me in Virginia. So he came to Virginia. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
12
[00:44:04] (KS) He was how old then? 
 
[00:44:06] (SM) He was 11. He decided to come live with me with Isabel Trouchout, my wife, 
and our son Anthony and it was a good family time, at that time. At that point I was thinking to 
go back to California, to a bigger wine industry, or a more established. Because Isabel, we met in 
California, so why not try to get relocated to California. But at the same time opportunities were 
here and there still are in Virginia. California is very competitive. You have a lot of wine makers 
on the market, a lot of people. I don’t have a network anymore there. It was a little bit 
complicated. We had to make a hard decision, are we going back to California or are we staying 
here. I saw that opportunities were here. Doukenie wineries was growing and in 2011 I did the 
consulting business. In 2012 I met David Greenhill. In 2013 he bought this property. In the same 
time I met other clients who needed help to produce their wine or plant vineyards. I was so busy 
with vineyard work and winery project that I say, why would you want me to go to California 
and work with a big winery just to go back to where I was before I came here. I think it’s nicer to 
work for small wineries and be involved with so many aspects of the wine industry than just to 
be a wine maker producing 200,000 cases in one label. At this point we decided to stay here. 
 
[00:46:03] (KS) I think also, part of what you were talking about was that you have so much 
more freedom here as a wine maker to experiment, to try things out. 
 
[00:46:15] (SM) Absolutely. And you have so many different grape varieties. Every winery has 
five, six, seven, eight different grape variety. Sauvignon blanc, chardonnay, hybrids, such a wide 
panel of grapes that you can experience to work with. The other thing is that winery owners 
don’t always know what they really want, because it’s new, a new industry for them as well. So 
they trust my own judgment very, very strongly and that is fantastic for wine maker to be able to 
have his confidence and trust from the owner to let you develop the wine however you want with 
no restrictions. 
 
[00:47:09] (KS) That’s extraordinary, really in any kind of work, to have that kind of freedom. 
 
[00:47:16] (SM) And as opposed to volume or even expenses, I’m careful about, because of 
pollution, because I want to make sure that it’s a return on investment for people who invest. I 
want some capital in their farm, but at the same time I’m not limited in terms of pricing either. 
So if I know that my cost of production is three times higher because I used some kind of 
techniques of barrel, I don’t have any hesitation to increase the price by three times if needed. So 
the freedom, yes, is very good. 
 
[00:47:56] (KS) Are there limiting factors that you find here? We talked about land and the cost 
of land and just the quantity of production being a bit of a limiting factor. Is labor an issue? 
 
[00:48:11] (SM) That would be a little bit political. Yes, labor became an issue since the new 
administration. For the past few years, first with Obama administration laws have been a little bit 
restrictive and I think a mandate. We saw some workers who were sent back to Mexico and since 
the new administration a lot of workers hide a little bit more or also get deported more, so we 
have a little bit of difficulties to hire less expensive labor. For the only reason is that there’s not 
enough on the market and landscaping companies are getting them with higher price point than 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
13
we can afford. So they go and work for specific industry like landscaping more than vineyard 
work. 
 
[00:49:27] (KS) That’s interesting, because I’ve heard the same thing from landscaping 
companies, that they’re losing guys because they’re getting poached to work in construction or 
something where they can be indoors, so there’s this tier. 
 
[00:49:39] (SM) Yes, and then it’s because there’s not enough people. When the workers have a 
choice to go where they pay more and they are more comfortable in terms of work conditions, of 
course they are going to do that. It’s also less and less crossing the border to work in America, so 
the pool becomes smaller and smaller. 
 
[00:50:02] (KS) Traditionally is it Mexican workers that pick in this area? 
[00:50:05] (SM) Yes, Mexican. 
[00:50:07] (KS) Because we don’t have a lot of Mexicans here usually. In Northern Virginia we 
tend to have more Salvadordians, or Bolivians, or Caribbeans. But it’s all Mexicans. Did they 
maybe start coming here because of the horse farms? 
 
[00:50:22] (SM) I don’t think so. I think they came here because of picking work. Any work they 
can get. 
 
[00:50:29] (KS) So they stay, or they tend to go back and forth? 
 
[00:50:33] (KS) Most of the time they stay. Because if they go back they have a hard time to go 
back. So a work visa can be possible to put in place. But some of the workers, they have worked 
here for 15 years, or ten years. You cannot just drop them. I feel a little bit responsible for them 
as well. You cannot just drop them to drop them when they are being participating in the 
development of your farm for ten years or fifteen years. You have an obligation, I believe, to try 
to give them a job. Some of them own houses, have kids in school, so you cannot just say, you 
know what, I do not need you anymore I’m going to get a work visa and get another Mexican 
worker. 
 
[00:51:29] (KS) That’s one of the things that activists have said. If it were easier to go back and 
forth, more people would go back and forth and not stay. 
 
[00:51:37] (SM) I agree. 
 
[00:51:38] (KS) And if the issue with people is that they stay and they’re using services or 
whatever, but if they could come back and forth easily. 
 
[00:51:45] (SM) Well, I think we should give them the choice. First, for two reasons. The first 
reason is, their condition of, their status is so insecure right now, they do not invest in America. 
So 90% of their money is sent back to Mexico, because they know they can be kicked out at any 
time. So all of the income they are doing, not benefits America, because everything goes back 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
14
there. So for me it’s so ridiculous that we do not give them the opportunity to invest in America, 
to build their houses and send their kids to school and go to the restaurant and consume and pay 
for insurance and all these things that would be so adding to our economy, instead to give them a 
very fragile status where they can be kicked out at any time, so they don’t want to buy a house 
here, they don’t want to invest. The only ones who does is married to an American person and at 
this point they have more chance to stay, their status is a little more secure, because they are 
married to an American person, but still, they can be kicked out. They are very scared to invest 
in anything, so now all their money goes back to Mexico. They all buy houses in Mexico and it’s 
okay, because when they’re kicked back they will retire there. They own a house. 
 
[00:53:12] (KS) It’s short-sighted. Did you become a naturalized citizen? 
 
[00:53:16] (SM) Not yet. I’m working on it. I would love to be an American. No question about 
it. For fifteen years I’ve been in America. I hold my green card now for more than four years. It 
was a long process. First to get my visa, HB1. I got my HB1 visa. I worked in California for five 
years, moved here to Virginia, got married with Isabel, so she sponsored my green card. So now 
I have my green card for the past four years. So I just sent an email to my lawyer saying maybe 
it’s time for me to become a citizen. First I pay a bunch of taxes in America and I would love to 
be able to vote. So that is my first desire. I feel deeply American, because I think I participate to 
our economy, I plant vineyard that will be here for thirty, forty, or fifty years. I’m a hard worker, 
so I think I could be a good American. 
 
[00:54:21] (KS) I think so too. 
 
[00:54:23] (SM) Not even, I don’t think to be an American is the color of your skin, or your 
philosophy. 
 
[00:54:29] (KS) Or your accent. 
 
[00:530] (SM) Or your accent, no I think it’s really more about what you can bring in to the 
country and be a part of. 
 
[00:54:38] (KS) I have friends right now, they’re Australian, and they’ve lived here 12 or 15 
years. They pay taxes, their children go to school here, but they always thought, you know, we 
can extend it, extend it, extend it, and then this current administration, so they’re having a hard 
time getting the paperwork processed, and I the mean time they can’t leave the country while it’s 
being processed and all of these different restrictions, so it’s tough. 
 
[00:55:06] (SM) It is tough. Now, with a green card it’s easier for me, because you can renew 
your green card every ten years. You just have to remember to renew it. But I think it’s really 
more freedom. But still, with my green card, I was talking with my neighbor over there and she 
was telling me, be careful Sebastien, don’t get any DUI, because with the new administration 
they are very restrictive with a green card holder, so if you get a DUI it’s an excuse for a judge, 
for immigration to kick you out. So she said in California now they are pressuring the green card 
holder as while, so buy a breathalyzer and test yourself before you drive, because you never 
know who can be on the road and, well first you should not drive with alcohol, when you’re 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

under the influence, but don’t take any chance, because that can be a big issue. And it is a big 
issue in California right now. 
 
[00:56:16] (KS) It’s crazy. Crazy days that we’re living in. Let’s get away from politics, because 
we could talk probably for a long time on that. What kind of training did you go through to be a 
wine maker? 
 
[00:56:24] (SM) When I was 13 years old I really enjoyed the life of my grandfather. He was a 
wine maker. He had a small vineyard in Burgundy and he was very inspiring to me, that you can 
grow grapes and make wine and by outdoors and have a good lifestyle. So at 14 years old I asked 
my dad if I could become a wine maker. So he did some research at that time and found a school 
in Burgundy called --- who were offering special training for young, motivated, and passionate 
individuals and at 14 years old I went to a facility to learn wine making, viticulture, chemistry, so 
it was a boarding school and I got all the viticulture training form that school, all the winemaking 
training from that school. So we had, for instance, five hours of wine tasting per week. And you 
were going out in the vineyard. The school had its own vineyard, so you were going to work in 
the vineyard, to learn the physical work in the field, hands on training as well. So for me, I was 
not the best student in the class before that school, but when I found that school it was very easy 
for me, because I was passionate about the wine, so all the math was easy, the history, the 
French, the English, and so I learned and found my passion there. On Sunday night when I was 
going back to school for boarding for the week I was pretty happy to be going. And after this 
school I got my degree in winemaking and viticulture and I decided to learn a little bit more in 
marketing and sales as well. So I went to another school to learn about sales and marketing in 
relation to the spirit industry as well. 
 
[00:58:44] (KS) How old were you when you finished? 
[00:58:51] (SM) 20 years old. 
[00:58:56] (KS) So it wasn’t like a high school as much as a training program and when you 
finished you were done. And what do you finished with? Is there a certificate? 
 
[00:59:03] (SM) Yeah, it’s like a bachelor’s of science. 
 
[00:59:09] (KS) That’s so cool. I want to go to a school like that. And then you did marketing 
and sales in a college setting? 
 
[00:59:16] (SM) Yes. 
 
[00:59:20] (KS) And then when did you first come to work at a winery? 
 
[00:59:28] (SM) At the same time as the school we had an internship. So every year we had a 
one, or two, or three month of internship. So this is really where you do your training. You learn 
in school, you’re hands on at the vineyard in winemaking school, but they send you every year to 
a different location to do your internship. So in 1986 I did my first internship in the village of 
Beaune, of Volnay, near Beaune, and I made all the practice vineyard work and in 1989 I did an 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
16
internship near the village of Volnay, a small winery named Cleauseaux Winery and I made my 
first wine. It was 1989. 
 
[01:00:23] (KS) What was the name of the village again? 
[01:00:25] (SM) Volnay. 
[01:00:30] (KS) And the other one before that was Beaune. 
 
[01:00:33] (SM) Yeah, it was Beaune. So Volnay, it was great, because the owner was great. 
That year was short in staff and he got sick, so the son was running the vineyard, so he was 
managing all the harvesters outside and the pickers. And because I was working with him 
already for a couple of years he was trusting me a lot. So he gave me the responsibility to 
produce his wine that year. So he was coming to see me once or twice a day, just to make sure 
everything was okay, but I was in charge of producing all of his wine in 1989. 
 
[01:01:29] (KS) And so how old were you then? 
[01:01:31] (SM) I was 16. 
[01:01:34] (KS) Holy shit. That’s pretty great. 
 
[01:01:39] (SM) And in 1990, same thing. He said, Sebastien you did such a good job, so he 
contacted my school and said I really want Sebastien again. And so every year since 1989 I made 
wine until 1993 for him. So 90, 91, 92,93. And that was a great experience for me, to be 
producing not only Volnay wine, but also ??? That is one of the best village in the Cote de 
Beaune region. They were producing Beaune. They were producing Marceau as well. So that 
was all of the big names in the wine industry in Burgundy. 
 
[01:02:28] (KS) So, from 16, I can’t believe. So then you were 19, about, when you finished 
working with him. And then you went where? 
 
[01:02:36] (SM) Yes. After that I was 19, 93. So I did one more harvest. The school was 
finished, so I worked with him for almost eight months. So it was the end of my internship with 
him. At that point, I think it was October or November. I went to the military. In French you 
have to do your time. Every young man has to do one year or ten months in the military. So I 
went for military for one year. 
 
[01:01:11] (KS) What kinds of things did you do in the military? 
 
[01:01:13] (SM) In the military I went, I was in the circulation. I don’t know what you call it. I 
did like an officer training. One year I went to a military school to get my grade of sergeant. It 
was six months of school for that and after my six months of school I became friends with a 
General, because he was friends with the owner of the winery in Volnay. So, he authorized me to 
make wine for Cleauseaux in 1994. Instead to be here, because I was not a military guy. I did 
what they asked me to do. It was not a good fit, but I said okay and instead to be in the military 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
17
for one year and cleaning my shoes or cleaning the toilet I wanted to do something, so I signed 
up for this program and after six months, eight months, the general, his name was General Bruce, 
he said, oh Sebastien if you need time off for the 1994 harvest I can give you some leave to make 
wine. Because he was friends with the owner of the winery in Volnay, Mr. Cleauseaux. And after 
one month he said, you can go if you want. So I got a release. 
 
[01:05:23] (KS) That’s pretty nice. Did you have to give him a lot of wine? 
 
[01:05:28] (SM) Yes. I was brining wine. It was part of the deal. And after that, I was free from 
the military. I did my time. It was a cool experience, a great experience. For me, pretty easy, 
because I was used to sleeping at the boarding school and being with all guys, so it was not too 
complicated. At that point I started looking for a job. You know, it’s time for me to go work. So I 
got a job in South France, in the region of Loungedoc. I went to work for Domain de Saint Louis, 
near the city of Montpellier. It was a great experience because Mediterranean weather is very 
different than Burgundy region. You have different grape varieties. In Burgundy you have Pinot 
Noir and Chardonnay, but here you have Syrah. We have some Chardonnay as well, but some 
Sauvignon blanc, some cabernet sauvignon, some Merlot. It was a brand new experience for me, 
working with types of grapes that I’d never worked with before. I stayed there for three years. I 
did three years with the Domain de Saint Louis and I did another year with Domain des Henri, so 
it’s another vineyard in that area as well. So I did four years in Loungedoc, total. After four years 
in Loungedoc I wanted to travel at that point. I said, I want to see something else. I met a 
gentleman named Monsieur Roux, Jean Louis Roux, who planted the first melon, fruit melon, the 
first melons in the Caribbean Islands. And he was telling me that it takes sixty days for a melon 
to grow in Martinique. 
 
[01:08:05] (KS) So this is how you ended up in Martinique. 
 
[01:08:07] (SM) Sixty days and it takes 120 days in France. He told me that he planted some 
vines there to do some experimentation and he could get fruit in one year there, instead of two or 
three years. So he was telling me, oh my god, in one year I’m able to get fruit. And I was pretty 
impressed by that. So I said why don’t we plant more? Why don’t we plant more vines there? 
And he said okay. So we went and we planted 21 acres. 
[01:08:43] (KS) And you get to be on a beautiful island. 
[01:08:45] (SM) Correct. 21 acres of vineyard. It was table grapes. I grew table grapes, for table 
and also for grapes to make wine. 
 
[01:09:05] (KS) They hadn’t tried grapes though? 
 
[01:09:08] (SM) They really, they said they had tried, but a long time ago. I think it was some 
monks who tried that in Guadalupe a long time ago. And also some of the Napoleon life time 
they tried to plant some. And if I understood, the French law prohibited any type of wine 
production in the colonies. So it was extremely difficult for me to get the rights to sell the wine. I 
got the rights to plant. I got the right to do some experimentation, but I didn’t have any rights to 
sell the wine. So I was financed by the European Union to do some experimentation. I was 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
18
financed by the French government as well to do some experimentations and some private funds 
as well. I did that for eight years. I stayed eight years in Martinique in the Caribbean island to 
grow those grapes. I was producing forty tons of grapes per year and I was selling them on the 
market. I was keeping maybe ten tons just to produce some wine just for experimentation. 
 
[01:10:27] (KS) What time period was these eight years? 
 
[01:10:31] (SM) 1996, I think, 97? Yeah, 97. It was a little bit later than that. Three years in the 
South of France, so that was… I need to look at my resume. 93 I did the military. 94 I did my 
last harvest. I left just after the harvest in Burgundy, 94, 95, 96. Yes, 93 last harvest, 94, 95, 96, 
97 in Loungedoc. 
 
[01:12:00] (KS) So 97 you went to Martinique? 
[01:12:01] (SM) Martinique. Correct. 
[01:12:02] (KS) And you were there for eight years, so 2005? 
 
[01:12:08] (SM) Yes. No, 2004. No, that’s not possible. Yes, 2002, because in 2003 I moved to 
California. Yes, because 2003 I did my first harvest in California. 
 
[01:12:41] (KS) So when was your son born? 
[01:12:43] (SM) 99. 
[01:13:03] (KS) Okay, so 2003 you moved to California and you had a job secured? Something 
lined up? 
 
[01:13:12] (SM) I think it was 96, when I arrived to the Caribbean Island. 
[01:13:14] (KS) Because you said, 95, 96, 97 was in the South of France. 
[01:13:19] (SM). 94 to 96. 97 to 2002, because in 2003. Something’s wrong here. 
[01:13:58] (KS) Oh, I’m counting wrong. I was saying five. 
[01:14:03] (SM) Well the math doesn’t work, because I arrived in 96. So that is six years, but I 
was travelling at that time already to Martinique to plant and establish the vineyards. So that is at 
the same time, overlap, as I was there. And after that I moved. In 2003 I moved to California. So 
this is what happened, in 2000, I think it was 2000, I met a professor Darcy Donan. He was a 
student doing his PhD from UC Davis. He was doing his research on agritourism. He had studied 
also, viticulture. So, one day I was on the radio, doing an interview on the local radio in 
Martinique, and Darcy Donan, with his girlfriend, were stuck in traffic and he heard the radio. I 
was telling on that interview that I was opening the vineyard to the public in Martinique. 
 
[01:15:33] (KS) So you finally did, you were able to.

[01:15:35] (SM) Open the vineyard to the public to just show them the techniques of growing 
grapes in the Caribbean Islands, but I was still not able to sell the wine. At that point he said, h 
my god it’s perfectly adapted to my research, agritourism, because I was inviting tourists to my 
property. So he contacted me and he came to visit the property and we became good friends. And 
I was explaining the difficulties that I have with the French government and how difficult it was 
for me to sell the wine and develop the label. So he offered me at that time, why don’t you go to 
America, because my god, you will be successful there. The people are looking for people like 
you and wineries are looking for people with experience like you and different visions of the 
wine industry, so you should definitely try to go there. So I said thank you, but my English was 
very poor at that time, so I said thanks, that great, but I don’t see myself there. My English is too 
poor. So for one year I didn’t really take his offer seriously. In 2001 I said, okay, I have a 
beautiful opportunity and I should take an airplane ticket to San Francisco and visit him and 
that’s what I did. I took a plane ticket, went to Miami. I was in America for the first time. From 
Miami I went to San Francisco. He picked me up from the airport and he was very good. His 
French was very good. So before I arrived he booked some interviews from some wineries in 
California, Sonoma and Napa Valley. So I went to this interview. One was Steve Ledson, from 
Ledson Winery. Steve Ledson had a good contact with me. He said, Sebastien, if you learn 
English and you’re motivated I would hire you as a winemaker, because you have an impressive 
resume. 
 
[01:18:19] (KS) Your friend was translating at the interviews? 
 
[01:18:20] (SM) Correct. So I went back to Martinique. I hired an English teacher. I tried to learn 
English every day and six months later I was at home alone, my phone ring, and it was Steve 
Ledson asking me if my English improved. I answered to him in English I didn’t have a 
translator at that point, so I didn’t have any choice. He asked me some basic questions. How 
many children I have, what I do. And I have some questions for him too at that point, so we had 
our first conversation together in English. He signed my visa at that point and I found a lawyer in 
San Francisco, Christen Troy and six month or eight months later I got my visa and went to 
America with my family to make my first wine in 2003. 
 
[01:19:40] (KS) For him, for Steve Ledson? 
[01:19:43] (SM) Correct. 
[01:19:50] (KS) I didn’t know where you were going when you started talking about melons and 
Martinique. That was a whole other direction. Let me ask you, before we leave Martinique. Was 
it good? You could make good wine? 
 
[01:19:04] (SM) Yes. Absolutely. It was just a fantastic experience. First, you have 2.5 harvests 
per year, because there’s no wintertime. So you can harvest 2.5 times per vine every year. So that 
goes very fast. You prune the vineyard, remove the leaves, and four months and a half later you 
have new grapes coming out. It’s just fabulous to see that you can really change the way of 
producing wine. So you can make a batch of wine every month. You prune, you rotate,

[01:20:40] (KS) So do they have someone there, are they still doing it? They never were able to 
figure it out? 
 
[01:20:45] (SM) No, I sold the vineyard to a company who was producing passion fruit, because 
it was a structure and the passion fruit needs to grow on the structure as well, so they were 
producing passion fruit to harvest the flower, because the flower has a very good smell, for the 
perfumery. So it was a fantastic opportunity in Martinique. You can make a batch. I learned so 
much about winemaking in Martinique, because you can make a batch every month, every other 
month. You don’t have to wait one year for the harvest to make experimentation, you can make 
it constantly. 
 
[01:21:43] (KS) That’s amazing though, because, for the experimentation, you get to try out all 
these different things. It seems like there should be a wine lab there. Somebody should set up 
some kind of research. 
 
[01:21:56] (SM) I know. I did that and it was more private than public, so I get some funds and 
then finance a lot my experimentation, but most of it was private funds, so I never really shared 
my research with anybody. At the end I shared some of it with an organization in the Caribbean 
Island, but it’s just fabulous, fabulous. 
 
[01:22:19] (KS) That’s wild. I’ve never even heard of anything like that. We got to California. 
It’s 2003. 
 
[01:22:40] (SM) I made my first wine in California in 2003. I remember that clearly. So I arrived 
there in June or July of 2003. 
 
[01:22:50] (KS) So you were there ahead of harvest? 
[01:22:53] (SM) Yes. 
[01:22:54] (KS) Well, I don’t know when they harvest. When do they harvest? 
[01:22:56] (SM) End of August, September. 
[01:22:58] (KS) So it’s similar to here. 
[01:23:00] (SM) So 2003, 4, 5 and I left in 2006. 
[01:23:10] (KS) To come to Virginia. 
 
[01:23:12] (SM) To Virginia. So I arrived in 2007 for Doukenie winery. And I’ve been here for 
ten years, so it’s good math. 
 
[01:23:30] (KS) Your big anniversary. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
21
[01:23:32] (SM) Yes, we celebrated it here and at Doukenie as well. So it was the four year 
anniversary of Greenhills and it was my ten year anniversary. We did that on the 25th of August. 
It was also my 45th anniversary, so it was big. 
 
[01:24:00] (KS) What do you see happening next for you? You’re going to be here for a while 
still? Getting it established? 
 
[01:24:13] (SM) I think so. I see it now, David Greenhill wants to purchase a winery in France. 
That’s our next step. Next month I’m going to France. 
 
[01:24:29] (KS) They’re going to think you talk funny when you go back there aren’t they? 
[01:24:31] (SM) Oh yeah, they will think that I’m American. 
[01:24:34] (KS) You’re so American now. We ruin people. 
 
[01:24:37] (SM) I’m going back there the second week of November to sign an offer for property 
that we found in Southwest France last May. And in December technically we should be closing 
on it. 
 
[01:24:59] (KS) So you’ve really go them convinced that this is a good way to go 
 
[01:25:02] (SM) Yeah, I think, yes. He is motivated. He really wants to focus with all the world. 
He doesn’t like the new world, California production. He really wants to make a difference on 
the east Coast and because I’m French, I have a French education and culture, he said, why not 
to purchase something in France. So this is the idea, the idea is to try to get something in France 
and develop our label. It would be a common label. It would be Greenhill Marquet label, so that 
will be the next step for me, to run both locations. And it’s great because I will have one foot in 
France and one foot still here. 
 
[01:25:50] (KS) Do you still have family in France? 
 
[01:25:54] (SM) Yes, my mom and dad, brother and sisters. Everybody’s there. 
[01:26:00] (KS) Where did you grow up? Did you tell me that? 
[01:26:03] (SM) Yeah, in Burgundy. 
[01:26:04] (KS) Is there a name of the town? 
[01:26:06] (SM) Yes, it’s Semur-en-Auxois. It’s an old medieval city. 
[01:26:20] (KS) That first part, do you know what it means? 
[01:26:30] (SM) No, I don’t know. Auxois is the region. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

[01:26:37] (KS) This doesn’t look at all like any French word I ever saw. 
 
[01:26:43] (SM) It’s older, medieval city, with a tower. They are saying that it was Hercules that 
built the town. It’s a magnificent town. 
 
[01:27:04] (KS) So you can go back and see family. 
 
[01:27:06] (SM) Yes, I will be going back there for a few days just to see everybody. 
[01:27:12] (KS) So it’s not too far from 
[01:27:14] (SM) It is far from the vineyard, yes, but when I land in Paris I will be driving down 
South and I will stop on my way. 
 
[01:27:25] (KS) Well, nothing’s so far in France compared to here. We’re much more spread out. 
He’s showing me a picture eon his phone. This is like a fairy tale place. Oh my god. Is this an old 
aqueduct? 
 
[01:27:45] (SM) Yes, an aqueduct. 
 
[01:27:47] (KS) My god. You expect to see the girl with her hair hanging out with window, 
looking for her prince or something. 
 
[01:27:55] (SM) We have all the river, down. Three sides of the town is surrounded by the river 
and we have fortification all around the town with towers and we have a beautiful cathedral in 
the heart of the village. It’s pretty impressive. 
 
[01:28:14] (KS) It’s beautiful. Wow, okay I’ll have to add that to my travel list. That’s gorgeous. 
I think that’s pretty much it. In the rest of your life, in your personal life, you’re married. You 
have a son, a stepson as well. 
 
[01:28:20] (SM) I was married separated from my first wife. I had my son Arthur in 1999 and 
met Isabel, my wife, who is a beautiful artist. She had two sons. One is named Justin and the 
second one Anthony who are very artistic as well, musician. So it’s a recomposed family. 
 
[01:29:01] (KS) Which is pretty common these days. So what other things do you do outside of 
the winemaking. Do you do any of the sports teams for the boys or anything like that? 
 
[01:29:13] (SM) Arthur’s sport is soccer, a player in high school and this is his last year in high 
school. I supported him in soccer for four years. It was almost a full time job. And it just finished 
yesterday. He lost his last game yesterday, last night. It was pretty sad. So now we are looking to 
focus on college for him. He seems to be interested by wine making as well. So I was 
considering to send him to the same school that I have been there. He’s 18 years old, so that 
would be the perfect school for him. He’s showing some motivation, so that would be the perfect 
experience for him, to go to France and study in French.

[01:30:00] (KS) Can he speak French as well? 
 
[01:30:04] (SM) Yes, fluently with no accent. He’s very, very good at his French and English, 
with no accent either. It would be a perfect education, a free education. He’s a French citizen, so 
all the school is free school in France, the public school, so you can get a $54,000 a year school 
at UC Davis or you can go to school in Burgundy. So I think the choice is quickly made. So I 
recommended him to do four or five years there and then do an extra year at Davis, to learn the 
technical words in English, then he could do the wine industry in America as well. 
 
[01:30:48] (KS) What is the full name of the school again? 
[01:30:50] (SM) L’eseau Vitcole de Beaune. 
[01:31:08] (KS) So like, Wine School 
[01:31:10] (SM) Correct. 
[01:31:18] (KS) Is there a time that I could maybe come back and watch when you are doing 
actual processing stuff? 
 
[01:31:28] (SM) Yes, we are done processing the grapes right now, but we are pumping the wine 
every day, putting the wine in barrels every day. Tomorrow we are pressing the tanks at 
Doukenie Winery, the last time for the winter tomorrow. But if not, you can come at any time. 
 
[01:31:50] (KS) I’d just like to get some pictures of the process and ask a little bit while it goes 
while you’re doing it. I’ll just follow you. 
 
[01:31:57] (SM) Yes we can do that any time. Just text me or send me an email. I’ll tell you what 
the schedule looks like. All year round we are packing, pumping, moving wine around. So grape 
processing are done at Greenhill winery now, because we picked everything, but we are racking 
barrels, pumping the wine, just that I think it is interesting to see. 
 
[01:32:31] (KS) Yeah, I would just like to get to see some of the different process that are going 
on. 
 
[01:32:45] (SM) I think you have it all, the dates all lined up. Because it’s vintages. Sometimes I 
do a vintage and move a half year later. 
 
[01:32:51] (KS) That’s the benefit of being a winemaker. You always have something to help 
remember it by.
