C-90 audiocassette recording made by Rusty Marshall 
Recorded August 18,1980 [log drafted November 18, 2019] 
Interview and conversation with John Farr on an introductory drive through the project 
area and other nearby sites, Summit and Grand Counties, Colorado 
SUMMARY 
SIDE A: Part 1 of 2-part recording made on introductory drive through segments of the Summit 
and Grand County CO region and parts of the (smaller) folklife project area, led by host-sponsor 
John Farr, accompanied by fieldworkers Rusty Marshall, Elke Dettmer, and Barbara Orbach, and 
Dettmer’s friend Eben Stronquist; recording begins at the Dillon Reservoir, Summit County CO, 
discussion of water issues, water supply for Denver, history and characteristics of Dillon Lake, 
mining and ranching in early days, regional transition in 1950s and 1960s as winter recreation 
grew; about growing and harvesting hay at high elevations, includes intermittent discussion of 
outdoor living history museums (the folklife project research intended to support Farr's planning 
for a museum in this region); about haying in the old days, haying had a social dimension as 
many came to work, a "Roman holiday"; passing the AMAX molybdenum mill (which processes 
ore from nearby mine), history of molybdenum in the region and in the U.S, role of tunnels to 
move ore, trucks and roads; regional history, cattle, sheep, and allusion to James Michener's 
novel Centennial and its description of regional demographics, about immigrant groups, 
including from Mexico, many moved successfully up the ladder, mention of Chinese immigrants 
(less local success), comments about the AMAX mill as the group drives past, about the mining 
company's service railroad; driving trip continues into Grand County, along the Williams Fork of 
the Colorado River. 
SIDE B: Part 2 of 2-part recording made on introductory drive through segments of the Summit 
and Grand County CO region and parts of the (smaller) folklife project area, led by host-sponsor 
John Farr, accompanied by fieldworkers Rusty Marshall, Elke Dettmer, and Barbara Orbach, 
Dettmer's friend Eben Stronquist; about early ski lifts built by AMAX for employees, skiiing 
caught more generally in the 1960s; about a Forest Service ranger station and the recent 
transition of forest and park rangers to more desk work; Farr tells story of a wilderness area set 
up by the US Forest Service in the 1930s, infested by beetles, regional old timers counseled the 
service to cut and burn trees to eliminate beetles. Forest Service could not, then in the mid-1940s 
tried to spray beetles, failed, eventually all trees were lost, roads cut into the area to cut trees, tale 
told as an example of government intransigence and poor planning; Farr tells another story, "not 
that the government makes all the mistakes," about a company that had built tunnels for AMAX, 
erected a big headquarters building in Denver but forgot to design in telephone service, costly 
retrofit was required; comments on the terrain and ranching in the general area where Williams 
Fork joins the Colorado River; discussion of haying methods and technology, recent methods 
employ mowers, swathers and/or rakes, and balers, in earlier days ranches used stackers (aka 
beavertails or overshots), but much hay is sold today and must be baled to truck it away, a 
haystack can only be used to feed cattle in the haymeadow; about balers and bale size and 
weight, how to get "strapping" high school boys to help with bigger bales, they are happy since 
fewer in number than small bales; comments about ditches and irrigation as the group passes 
examples; how there is more moisture on north slopes, drier on south slopes; comments on the

drive south along the Blue River, comments on desirable landscape features for living history 
museum. 
DETAILED OUTLINE WITH ELAPSED TIME 
SIDE A __ 
00:22 
At the Dillon Reservoir, sometimes referred to as Lake Dillon, John Farr explains 
about the site, freshwater reservoir located in Summit County, for the city of 
Denver, and its waters are under the control of Denver Water, Farr says half of 
Denver's water supply, don’t reprocess water, built about 15 years ago [Wikipedia 
reports 1963], 250,000 acre feet of water, about a tunnel 26 miles long, shafts and 
tunnels to move water, is a reservoir, few years ago down about 100 feet, water 
critical in the West, this is one of the highest lakes in country, many sailboats, 
highest sailing lake in world, 9000 feet elevation, they sail the storm fronts, sailboat 
racing, no swimming, surface temp is 46 or 47 degrees, hypothermia risk. 
03:00 
You store water as high as you can, can move it downhill_ 
Compare to the Thompson project [Colorado-Big Thompson Project aka C-BT), a 
federal water diversion project to collect West Slope mountain water from the 
headwaters of the Colorado River and divert it to Colorado's Front Range and 
plains.] Farr says that is around Granby, separate from this, done by the Bureau 
of Reclamation. 
04:00 
This is by the city of Denver, look at the spillway, "glory hole," at a narrow point, 
old town of Dillon was where the lake water filled in; about Eisenhower tunnel, 
highest auto tunnel in the world, on 1-70, venting to counteract risk of carbon 
monoxide, need fans to exhaust 
05 ?? 
Second voice: size of vents? 
Farr: there are some vou can't see, need to be oriented to avoid snow filling the vents 
Pause (silent segment) 
06:50 
Had been ranching, partly to support mining, Fremont had come thru here in 19* 
century; later, after miners arrived, high prices for things like food, not much game, 
so the ranches came in to provide meat, but mining was boom or bust, but about 100 
vrs ago, ranching started to pay off 
09:00 
About early ranches, some homesteaders, got caught by surprise at the severe 
weather, but livestock on grass made a lot of sense, hay meadows worked out, dug 
out sagebrush and put in water and hay, profitable to 1950s, but after that the 
mountain ranches failed at making money, in the 1960s winter recreation came in, 
drove up land prices. 
11:00 
Old hay fields now subdivided for second homes, changes the land value, has 
drastically changed land use in mountain country_ 
Once many people moved in, need for water treatment, need handling of sewage, 
about demand for water, now have had to put in sewer plants that more or less put 
our pure water, all built in the last few years, 4 plants above Lake Dillon_ 
13:22 
Treated water goes right in the river right in the lake; Kremmling, a lot of old timers 
had summer ranched in this high country, but now the opposite, more come to ski in 
winter___ 
14:20 
Hay fields, where they can get water, only 20 inches rain every year; flood irrigated, 
built vears ago; replaced the [desert terrain] and sagebrush; you see tall grass now.

support cattle grazing; then move cattle out, cheaper than trying to cut hay and move 
it to feed 
16:20 
[One year, recent drought] Lots of cattle come up from Texas, drought there, need to 
move them keep alive; comment on electric power 
Pause (silent segment) 
17:24 
About the Loveland pass, old main pass into this valley, [before the Eisenhower 
tunnel] kept open in winter starting in 1936; about narrow gauge railroads; in 1928, 
first auto came over the pass, not much transportation in this country, just wagon 
roads, only way out, via Kremmling, but still had to cross passes, this was an 
isolated area for a long time 
Pause 
19:20 
Hike asks where to get maps, discussion 
20:00 
Rustv: About how this is our main research area 
Rusty: a couple of ranches [we have seen] would be nice sites for museum; ideas 
about museum, set [interpretive] date as, say, the 1920s; the museum needs a few 
acres, comments on Jensen outdoor living history museum in Logan Utah, working 
buildings, but spoiled a little by how elose to traffic and power lines 
22:36 
Farr on the meadow on hillside [in view], can grow hay; the trip makes a stop at the 
McKee ranch, Farr comments, "that's Rich right there"; car stops 
Pause 
24:00 
Rusty: What creek 
Farr: right on the - 
Rustv nice place back here [for museum], but so much development, home sites 
25:15 
Recorder shut off 
Restart, Farr explains about haying: cut, windrow, bale; in the old days it took 11 
people, [cut with scythe]; Farr: Haying time was a Roman Holiday in the old days, 
lots of people came out; about ranch houses: at hay season, you need a long table, 
gals had to prep a lot of food, major production, city people came out, big social 
event; then equipment came along and changed that, but equipment is so expensive, 
now shared among ranchers or the work is contracted 
28:00 
About the major road [they are driving on], this is a big mining operation, 
molybdenum; discovered at Leadville some time ago, end of the Civil War, no 
commercial payoff until 1918 
At one point, Germans owned it, shipped the metal to Europe for armor plate, the 
US figured that out, US govt took over, business struggled, then WWII pushed it up 
again; found a big ore body and revived it, built a new mill. 
[paraphrase from other sources: In the 1870s and 1880s, samples of molybdenite 
(molybdenum disulfide) were identified in the Colorado Rockies. In 1918, the 
Climax Molybdenum Company was established to recover and process the metal. 
The metal's primary use was in the production of armor plating and large gun barrels 
during World War I. After the war, the market disappeared for a period, restarting 
during the 1920s with new uses for molybdenum in metallurgical and chemical 
applications. In 1957, Climax Molybdenum Company merged with The American 
Metal Company to form American Metal Climax, Ine., known as AMAX.] 
Rarr comments on an old road on a grade, trucks could gear up and make it; from 
here the ore is 15 miles underground, 10-mile tunnel, miners go in at Georgetown, 
Collection AFC 1991/031 
Log for AFS 22449 
Page 3 
the milling is done here, have to move a lot of ore to get much molybdenum, then 
shipped to Pennsylvania, molybdenum is one mineral we have lots of m the US, we 
export- the AMAX company is good, excellent safety, treat workers well - 
32:00 
1 like to drive up here, view spectacular, mill impressive. Hike asks question, f arr. 
about ranchers and sheep men, these were all livestock men, raised cattle mostly, too 
high for sheep, these are not farmers; sheep are labor intensive, more work than 
cattle; itinerant workers came thru to hay; meanwhile on the front range, there more 
agriculture, more people came in, many nationalities, refers to book Centennial 
(Michener), about how there was lots of migrant farm labor back then, and those 
that desired [could move up in society]; many Mexicans in the 1930s and during the 
war, some stayed here, many farms now run by Mexicans who stayed, an American 
ctnr\/- !i1<sn some from Jaoan. farmers -- 
36:00 
But Copper Mtn, Chinese, to build railroads, or to mine gold; Chinamen would pan 
pold all dav- at the Climax mine, many underground workers are Mexican 
37:00 
This is the big mill, 1,000 people work here around the clock, there is a dam in back, 
manage and recycle own water, they won a lot of awards, worked with Forest 
Service, a real model for others ____— 
38:20 
Another male voice — question; Farr: about the tram coming up to mill, stilhless 
steel cars; about another mine, lots of raw ore being removed, manage the water and 
by products; employs 4,500 people ----- 
39-45 
Recording stops_____—-- 
39:45 
Restart, looking at samples, molybdenum, some other minerals, ai me end ihc 
remainder is get marble dust, in tailing ponds, no one has found a good product use— 
41:10 
Farr: after mining, the rock is sized, goes underground, crushed to a given size, goes 
into mill, scale or operation is big, hundreds of thousands of tons (?) per day, 
molybdenum extends the life of the iron we've got 
43:00 
Railroad goes up the valley 5 miles, goes into the mountain; about the powdery 
fine" from the rock, not toxic ---- 
' This is Williams Fork of the Colorado River; Rusty: we are m Grand county, Farr, 
ves we crossed the pass --- 
44:45 
Farr on history of county formation, got subdivided. Summit County was bigger, 
now smaller, the remainder_________ 
45-30 
More tailings back there .... 
45:52 
End of side .......— 
00:25 
(audio starts) About early ski lifts, first on built by AMAX, then others m the early 
1960s, rope tow and T-bar that went up one of those ridges, employees all skied 
there, about level segment. -- 
01:15 
Hike Dettmer: is this mostly sagebrush? Farr: yes, a lot of grass and plants in these 
but the sagebrush is what holds the snow ___ 
01:30 
This is an old ranger station down here, but they [rangers] are all bookworms now, 
thev never let them out in the field, big central offices, mileage limits on their trucks 
02:23 
(pause) woman's voice: about Forest Service and reclamation contracts, animosity 
Farr: always some conflict, govt agencies, especially with make work projects in the 
1930s a lot of people who lived here took some of that land [public landlfor-

granted; 1 have mixed emotions, is having federal land in the West wise as 
compared to the East where there isn't any, or not? Some things done in the name of 
the govt are the biggest crimes that every happened, and the govt is never consistent 
03:20 
— we've got any area over by Glenwood Springs called the flattops, was a 
wilderness area in the 1930s, started to get beetles in there, some of the old-timers 
went in, let's kill these beetles, cut trees and burn them, they said, can't do that, 
wilderness. So the war broke out, people distracted, beetles really got going, this 
had been one of the most magnificent high altitude spruce forests in the world, 3-4 
feet [trunks], but stands, so dark like being in the night, and it just devastated this, 
govt spent millions in the mid-1940s just spraying, it's long gone, ended up 
harvesting the dead wood for pulp, cut roads all over the wilderness area, still there, 
you can get thru in a jeep, violated the wilderness concept, in the end could not 
harvest it because too difficult to reach, fallen trees, does not rot, takes 200-300 
vears to rot - we have more conflict from that sort of stupidity - 
05:50 
Pause, no talk 
06:00 
Rusty: nice meadows here, is this Ute Park? [Ute Pass?] Farr: yes. Rusty: along the 
Williams Fork River. 
Pause 
06:30 
Farr: not that the government makes all the mistakes, a company came in to drill this 
tunnel for AMAX, [Dravo? Sounds like], big international engineering company, 
built a building in downtown Denver, got ready to move in last fall, big company, 
major building, but no provision made for telephone or communication, delayed for 
a month. 
07:30 
They used to fly their people in and out here in jets when they were building this 
tunnel, very well run company 
07:40 
Rusty: that's a pretty place over there. Farr: the country opens up real wide here, we 
hit the Colorado River right here, it comes down [may be heading toward Parshall 
CO?], Wiliams Fork Reservoir is down here a little ways, a lot of little stock 
reservoirs [ranchers?] have built; I read that we are completing 5 dams a day in 
America, a lot of them are small dams, water control projects, a lot of dams 
08:35 
Rusty: they're not using that hay stacker there, are they? Just sitting there? Farr: just 
sitting there. Rusty: don't use them if you bale hay? Is that your term? Farr: can 
call them beavertails but I always call them an overshot [stacker], some call them 
stackers. 
(pause) 
09:10 
Rustv: it's too bad the Blue River Valley isn't this wide 
Pause 
09:35 
Rusty: this is a nice view. Farr: opens up here pretty good. You narrow down from 
Parshall to the canyon as you head for Hot Sulphur — the other side of Kremmling, 
there are a couple of valleys that come into the side, sort of like this, there is an 
immense amount of irrigated land, ranches — 
Pause 
10:30 
Rusty: we had a lovely view of Rabbit Ears from our cottage at Grand Lake; Farr: 
no it is a different place. Rabbit Ears is above Steamboat, [another Rabbit Ears?] by 
you-___

10:50 
Rusty: nice one there. I'd like to get someone to show us how hay staekers operate. 
Some people still using them? Farr: yes — but around here a lot of these people will 
sell this hay, they can get a good price for it, good, wild hay for horse feeding, [need 
baled hay to sell and move] - don't know anyone around here that uses them, but a 
few places you see - look like loaves of bread [hay staeks] - piek the hay up, make 
stacks, and they are going to fork it right back to them [cattle], big problem with 
baled hay, when you go to feed, you have to break it loose for them, cut the twine, 
use a fork to spread it out so the cattle can get at it. Rusty: easier to fork it out of a 
loose stack. Farr: may not plan to keep cattle there this winter - upwards of $100 a 
ton right there 
Pause 
12:30 
Farr: baler are set, you can get a given density and length, uniform for stacking, 
[recent past] if someone was not looking, you eould get a bale 5 feet long, bend in 
the middle, then you'd run out of hay, get a 2 foot bale, but they'll run anywhere 75 
to 80 pounds, if a rancher's got a bunch of big strapping kids, and you want to 
handle a minimum number of bales, adjust the length so it is little longer, twine is on 
a continuous spool, he may turn out a bale that's 100 pounds, always a marvelous 
thing you can do with kids, if they think there's less numbers, get something done 
faster although the same volume. About his dad and cement when Farr was young, 
high school crew, if done before 5, go home, so we went fast 
14:25 
Rusty: there's a log house. Farr: between this and that one - starting to get homes 
all over, not everyone wants to be in a ski area 
14:45 
Farr: this is the Williams Fork Reservoir, the river goes thru a notch in that ridge, 
also part of the Denver city water system; [out the window] yes, he is baling here 
and raking there, that's called a swather, 14 or 16 feet, cuts the hay and then brings it 
together, lays it out there and it dries that way, they don't have to handle it twice [as 
with a windrow rake], but it rained on it the other day, this guy's using this rake and 
he's rolling the windrow over to where it was on the ground, wet underneath, it’ll 
dry out, if wet when baled it will generate heat and spoil, even catch fire, normally 
would not turn it twice but it got wet on 'em 
15:55 
Rusty: wish that raneh was in the [project] area, it's a beautiful place [pause] 
16:15 
Farr: see the lines on these hills, where they pulled ditches to get water, various 
places, water rights, you get plaee you think are dry and you get on top and find 
water, have whole hayfield or even orchard, they run the water for miles to get it in 
there 
16:40 
Farr: ok we are going to go around the back side, this is where the ore trucks - they 
catch the highway 
17:01 
Rusty: I'm going to turn this [reeorder] off so we ean talk later - 
[? sound of recorder off then on] 
17:05 
Farr: most of this country is pretty dry, that is basically a north facing mountain that 
doesn't get too high, that's the only place they'll grow until you get real high, in the 
high mountains you hear "north slope" and "south slope" - eyerything is one or the 
other, south faces sun, relatively dry, north slope, not dry, grows your big timber 
and big aspen until you get to the point where you are high enough to get moisture 
year round, thaf s even true on the prairie, the north side of a hill will have more

growth than the south. If you hike a valley, you hike the south side because the 
veeetation is less dense _ 
18:15 
Rusty: [about passing lumbering?] Farr: for dimension lumber 
Farr: this is where they [trucks] come back in from the mine, bring the concentrate, 
railroad, and load it, main line of the Denver-Rio Grande RR, ship out the 
concentrate, over there, narrow deep canyon where the Colorado River goes down, 
no roads, you've got to go over the top to get back down, beautiful country back 
there, store back over there, about 60 miles, owned by the Bums family, general 
store with groceries and clothes and straw hats, everything from one store 
19:16 
Rusty: so we are going back toward Silverthorne there? Farr: Blue . . . Rusty: this is 
Colorado highway 9? Farr: yep 
19:30 
Farr: right here is one of the most beautiful views in the whole state, northern end ot 
the Eagle Nest Wilderness Area, [peaks] are right up under 14,000 feet, we follow 
here our countv [Summit] is that way, Vail is iust to the right here — 
Pause, recorder stopped and restarted 
20:15 
Rusty: OK, we are driving up the highway [highway 9 southbound?] and are just 
about at Ute Pass - Farr: the northern limit of the region [project study area?], south 
is uphill here, from interstate 1-70, you could more easily come 
pause - 
21:05 
Farr: this is Slate Creek, right over here, old school building and ranches, they are 
iust starting haying here, just across from this site 
Pause —-- 
21:50 
Farr: that's where we saw that guy haying last year - rock pile, big boulders, too big 
to move, but when they move rocks, use a stone sled, big winter sled on mnners, 
load the rock, because if you hit a rock with a sickle it breaks, then you gotta stop 
and renair vour sickle bar but some of these rocks are just too big to move 
22:34 
Farr: you will see in the, middle of a field, a little pile of rock, probably means there 
was one too big to move so they piled the rest around it 
22:45 
Rustv' [where we went last year] Farr: to the foot of that hill 
Pause ___ 
23:10 
Rustv: that's pretty over there - 
pause________ 
23:35 
Rusty: any particular spot or ranch you have your eye on [planning museum.''] farr. 
not really .... 
23:45 
Farr: don't want to be disappointed - this is where you turn m to mine, just across 
the river, vou turn in right here [pause] 
24:00 
Farr: 1 figure this is adaptable enough, the requirement is that we get enough water 
rights that we can irrigate some piece of it — the other thing that you mentioned, 
about the view, this road in the not too far distant future will be 4 lane, enough 
traffic that goes west to shale and ~ some goes straight west, some north, this road 
runs northwest and this is the fastest way to Steamboat now - 20 miles shorter than 
Granby - more traffic, being adjacent to it is fine, there is no side valley. I'd just as 
soon be a little further away from it [pause]
