Heritage 
X 
 
The year my mother was born 
in Fairfax, Oklahoma,  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
white men were marrying Osage 
 
 
 
 
women and killing them 
for their headrights. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
My mother was born a year after  
The Indian Citizenship Act was passed –  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Indians tied to the U.S. 
for or against their wills. 
 
 
Three years before her birth, her half sister 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Baby Ruth’s grave was dynamited  
with nitroglycerine by outlaws 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
scavenging for diamonds 
and gold buried inside the casket. 
 
In the Tallchief plot  
 
 
 
 
 
 
I wander through family history – 
the marble monuments, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
angelic statues – measuring 
 
 
 
 
each step on grass, 
 
memorizing photographs.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 This one of a striking 
 
 
 
 
beauty, my great grandmother 
 
Eliza Bigheart Tall Chief, 1870 -1962, 
surviving her husband  
by fifty years. The widow, the adored  
grandmother of my mother. Eliza. 
Only now do I see my name 
a permutation of hers. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At home in Chicago 
every day I pass   
family photographs framed 
 
 
 
 
on walls. My great grandfather’s 
 
oval sepia portrait  
of his boyish face 
replicated on the headstone. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Instead of the young bride, 
 
 
 
 
here is Eliza, a tribal elder,   
 
 
 
 
 
wrapped in a multi-colored 
 
 
 
 
 
blanket, standing outside  
her front porch, a photo 
taken after all those years 
 
 
 
 
she outlived him.
