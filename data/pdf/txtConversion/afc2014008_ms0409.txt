Re:  Application from Orinoco Dance Foundation for support of a presentation
 
entitled Aboriginal Arts of Australia to tour five cities (
$40,000 requested).
 
This application was reviewed among the late materials at our December (
1980)
 
panel meeting, and it was recommended for rejection by Folk Arts.  The panel
 
thought that this was an interesting and well-conceived project in its own
 
right, but that it would not be appropriate for Folk Arts because it does not
 
reflect our guidelines.  Folk Arts is essentially concerned with the preservation
 
and encouragement of artists and art forms indigenous to the United States.  We
 
have therefore rarely funded projects concerned with bringing exhibits and
 
performances from abroad to this country.  The only exceptions have been when
 
there was a related ethnic community that might benefit.
 
The panel emphasized that this is a well-planned and, worthy idea; their concern
 
was its degree of appropriateness for Folk Arts or general Endowment funding.

Over the past four vears, the Folk Arts Program has been accepted as a national
 
model for its pioneering work in making more visible the artistic excellence
 
in the arts forms of the many cultural communities making up our nation of
 
nations.  Central to this work has been the recognition of diverse cultural-
aesthetic systems, each with its own criteria for excellence.  From Sioux
 
teepee decoration, to Appalachian basketry, to Chinese Pekin Opera, each
 
cultural tradition and each art form has its own inherent criteria for excellence.
 
In incorporating the recognition of aesthetic diversity in its program, Folk
 
Arts has set a precedent now followed by a great number of arts organizations
 
and cultural programs throughout the United States and its territories.
 
Central to this work has been another successful major effort, the development
 
of regional and state folk arts coordinators.  This network of human cultural
 
resources assists governmental agencies, educational institutions, local
 
community groups, and others in bringing to the public the most outstanding
 
works of our country's diversified wealth of traditional artists.  It further
 
serves to decentralize the federal effort, combining the perspectives of local
 
and national authorities.  In more than twenty cases, these local positions
 
have grown into mature programs, nurtured exclusively by local fiscal resources.
 
Localized attention to traditional art forms, themselves usually rooted in
 
local cultural communities, has proven to be a most effective complement to
 
our own activities at the federal level.

My dear Mr. Abrahams,
 
Roger re*ninds me, to my shame, that I have not been  in  touch
 with
 you  s
ince
 
wy trip to Nevis in August.  I had called you twice the week that I got back
 
but managed to miss you both times; then I was sucked back into the maelstrom
 
of my day--to-day duties.  I an deeply embarrassed that I neglected to thank
 
you for so long.
 
Please know that I
, and my son, and my nice, had a glorious week at Morning
 
Star, even though we were literally blown back home by hurricane Allen.
 
?
f
1
1
orning Star looked gorgeous, and Hyacinth was, as usual, in calm control.
 
We arrived the week of the Gulturama, and Hyacinth, Rodolphe and Merit
 
concented to .
join us at a visit to the sports exhibition, a series of inter-
island races and athletic competitions at the cricket grounds that we all
 
enjoyed immensely.
 
We also called upon Mr. Hunkins, who was at the moment completing a beautiful
 
coffin in his workshop.  He seemed calm and not inclined to move precipitately.
 
When I mentioned to him your concern that the property he had bought should be
 
maintained in a fashion appropriate to the history and culture of the island,
 
he said that he hoped you were not concerned on that point.  My sense was
 
that he intended to renovate (
if at all) very slowly and with appropriate
 
consideration for t
he historical significance of the surround.
 
Mr. Abrahams, I am not sure that I have conveyed to you the personal gratification
 
I have received from your generous hospitality.  That all sounds a bit overblown,
 
but I can't think of any other way to put it.  The fact is that Morninx Star
 
now seems a home-sway from-home for s
ee.  If I never visit there again, I shall
 
forever remember the peace and tranquility of your garden, the sight of the
 
egrets flying home t
o their roosts across the misty mountain every evening, the
 
down--home cordiality of Hyacinth and the rest of the staff.  It has been an
 
extraordinary experience.

Mr. Cordon H
. Hills
 
Heritage Researcher
 
Shoalvater Bay Indian Tribe
 
Tokeland, WA  98590
 
Dear Hr. Hills,
 
Thank you for your letter enquiring about the Folk Arts Program and a
bout the
 
possibility of applying for a grant to acquire Shoalvater Bay language and
 
literary materials from the rational Anthropological Archives.
 
Technically speaking, such requests should more properly be funded t
hrough the
 
archives division of the rational Endowment for the t
iummities.  However, in
 
actual fact, few tribal archives can match the requirements s
et up by NF11, so ue
 
have occasionally stretched our own guidelines to help out.  You may also be
 
interested to know that during early December '
UM is sponsoring a conference
 
to discuss the archival problems of Native American tribes, and a new .
joint
 
P
I
SA
.INCH policy may emerge from that meeting.
 
however, as you have probably heard from Jeff Gamble, the Shoalvater Bay tribal
 
records do not seem to he complete.  The tribe, in fact, has yet to close out
 
a 1
970 grant from the Folk Arts Program (
a very small one) and I believe has
 
also not concluded a grant from the Humanities Padowment (
a very large one).
 
I do not, of course, have the full TER information, but I believe Jeff is
 
sending you all the material we have on the I
' M grant.
 
All this makes me feel a bit nervous about your new project idea, though of
 
course the Program continues to want to be as helpful as possible to the
 
Shoalvater Bay tribe.  I would suggest that you do what you can to clear up
 
all old grants business first.  Then, when you decide to apply to the Folk
 
Arts Program again, I think you should try in the body of the application to
 
assure our reviewing panel that there will be some continuity in t
he handling of
 
the proposed project.  For exaaple, has the Heritage Conmaittee begun to carry
 
out any of Jeff Titon's reco mendations for conserving and archiving the
 
materials already collected under our Prantl  If you could bring us up to date
 
on such matters and also describe the archival procedures you've adopted, i
t
 
would be properly cared for.
 
I shall enclose a copy of our program brochure, a leaflet announcing; our
 
apprenticeship program which you can post. and a copy of our guidelines for
 
your use in applying to us.  Jeff has expressed willingness to advise you by
 
phone, if you have further difficulties either with the old grant or the new
 
2
 
l
-
s
 
application; and of course I should be clad to help too.  Please feel free to
 
call me person to person collect at 202-636-4282, and I will return your call
 
on the federal line at no cost to you.  My associate, Richard Keeling, would
 
also be glad to help; he can be reached at the same number.

P.S.  Martha Euenhold, our program administrator, has just checked the Shoalwater
 
Bay grant with our grants office.  The original grant was made March, 1978 for
 
a sum of $1,810 for "support to record the verbal arts traditions of Shoalwater
 
tribal members".  It was amended in November of 1978 to add another $
2,000 to
 
the original grant.  No final report has been received.  Grant funds have been
 
paid in full, the final installment payment having left this office in November
 
of 1979.  Incidentally, the grant was made not to the tribe but to the Nampsch'sts
 
Community Foundation.  I hope this information helps.

Dear Doris:
 
I an enclosing a copy of the letter I wrote Ted Brooks in Los aneeles, a
s well
 
as a copy of the program brochure that P
lank put out for the Bireninghan Cospel
 
Puartet reunion.
 
The cast of characters say still be a bit contusing
;, so let me run through it
 
once more.  Ted Brooks is the quartet singer who recently reunited with his
 
brother, Reverend Robert B
. Brooks (
1147 hest 4th, Jacksonville); both of
 
the brothers were born and raised in Florida, and the quartet Ted B
. started
 
with began in Florida.  Ted Brooks appeared, during his recent visit to his
 
brother, on a local gospel radio program run by Ethel Bannister (
904-356-4003).
 
This is what started all the local excitement; lots of people called and wrote
 
in wanting copies of the records played on the show and urgings a reunion
 
concert in Jacksonville.  Ted is an extraordinary guy; though in his late
 
sixties, he could pass for 30 -- full of energy and drive and s superb musician.
 
If he were based in Florida, I think
. he could pull this off all by himself;
 
unfortunately, he's not.
 
I have spoken to Reverend Brooks; he turns out to be a lovely friendly old
 
gentlesan who says he would love to see the concert happen but that he is no
 
entrepreneur.  Apparently Mrs. Bannister's recovery i
s the essential ingredient,
 
but I have to s
ay that she was described to me by TeA Brooks as "ageable".
 
The Rev. Brooks took your name, and won't be surprised if you call.  re will
 
call either you or me as to Mrs. Bannister's recovery.
 
Finally, I think I should tell you that the bt mingham concert, though an
 
artistic success, was a fiscal flop.  The audience that ca m enjoyed itself
 
enormously and was about 99'" black.  However, the numbers were far too fewt
 
Indeed I suspect they were montly friends and relatives of the local performing
 
quartets.  The greater black community, I
've afraid, had decided it was another
 
white rip-off, since the wain concert organisers were both white.  I do believe
 
involving some segment of the black coam mity in presenting this kind of thing
 
in Jacksonville would be a key factor to arousing comwnity support.
 
So -
-- everything is pretty indefinite, but just saybe something nice can happen
 
here.  It's glorious  m
mu
us
si
ic
c,
, and I would be tickled to death if it could be
 
heard again.  Let me know if there is anything more the program or I can do
 
about Moving this vague possibility forward.

Dear Mr. Brooks,
 
I spoke today with your brother, and he t
ells m
e that Mrs. Bannister, who he
 
feels would have to spearhead the movement to hold a quartet reunion concert
 
in Jacksonville, is ill and in the hospital.  This may cause our plan to be
 
delayed a little, but we will hope for the best.
 
In the reanti m
e, I also called r
a
y friend, Doris Dyen, st the Florida Volklife
 
Center, and she will be very happy to drive over to Jacksonville and speak
 
with Reverend Brooks and Mrs. Bannister, wben she is well, about how to apply
 
for a grant.  Or else you could perhaps drive by and -
meet with her in White
 
Springs the next time you visit Florida.  She is a nice person, and I think
 
you would like to s

Pear Dale,
 
here is my tentative schedule for the Pacific.  I
'd really appreciate any
 
advice you might have on whether or not i
t is practicable and also on how I
 
might best use the times I will have available on all these farflung islands.
 
My only major sorrow is that I won't get to Yap where I imderstand traditional
 
arts are in the best condition of any place.  It was either Yap or Truk
., and
 
the schedule that included Truk was far more humane than the alternate.  Do
 
you think I
've decided wisely? It still could be changed to include Yap and
 
bypass Truk; there is no way to get to both of them in the time I have.
 
I have sent a copy of this to Roy Melees ,
 and I will call him in a few days
 
and see if he can arrange my visits to the various arts councils.  I shall
 
then begin corresponding with other people who have been recommended to me
 
and hope that they will get in touch with their arts council and pet into
 
my schedule . Does this wake sense as a way of operating ? I
'm not used to working
 
out such a complex tour.
 
Perhaps you could five we a call when you've had a moment to look all this over.

Dear Gus,
 
Thank you for your letter.  I think your project of teaching children correct
 
ceremonial regalia, dance steps and songs is an extremely nice idea, and I
'm
 
happy to hear the Oklahoma Arts Council has already made a contribution.  If
 
you s
hould decide to apply to us, You might want to talk about it in terms of
 
general cultural reinforcement rather than sim !
s
ly
_ as a Tiny Tot program, which
 
makes it sound at first like a sort of nursery school project, and one that Vould
 
be difficult, therefore, for the Arts Endowment to fund.  It probably sounds a
 
bit silly to you, but it makes a difference to us when a program is described as
 
supporting the elders in passing on their knowledge to the young, rather than
 
supporting young people in learning from their elders.  The first is more of
 
an Arts Endowment project; the second is more of an Office of Education project.
 
I
'm enclosing a few nf our new brochures for your use as well as a copy of our
 
guidelines in case you decide to apply.  Our next application deadline is
 
January 1
, for projects scheduled to start in July.  If the amount you need is
 
relatively small, we could possibly use sass administrative Procedures that
 
would get you funded (
if the panel recommends the project) as early as Arril.
 
When you begin to work on the application, don't hesitate to get in touch and
 
we can help advise you on such matters.  Just call me person-to-person collect at
 
202-694-4282, and I or another staff mer+ber will return your call on the federal
 
line at no cost to you.

Dear Vally,
 
Re-read our progran description, a copy of which I
'r enclosing.  Just the first
 
pages will do.  Folk Arts is dressing a dream that i
s wilder even than yours.
 
we are trying to filture out ways in which federal tax dollars can be used to
 
help keep folk and local artistic traditions alive and growing in the face of
 
an increasingly electronl
.fied society.
 
Folklorists -- and I include here myself and my nearest and 4eareast relatives --
used to ask for public funds in order to document and preserve artistic traditions
 
for the benefit of future generations.  But those future generations always, some-
how, turned out to be our own sons and our own daughters -- not the sons and
 
daughters of our very finest r
end noblest singers and musicians and craftevorkerss.
 
Their sons and daughters grew u
ps to reject and ftspis
+a as old-fashioned the
 
products of their own ancestors.  They heard the overwhelming message of our
 
televisions and of our schools.
 
We are now trying, in many clumsy and ill-suited ways, to redress this situation.
 
&
'e are trying to learn host people can maintain their own cultures, their own
 
artistic expressions, in the face of an enormously powerful communication system
 
that says that if you're not a rwober of the cast of Dallas, you're nobody.
 
FAlly,  try to turn things around in your own head.  Try, to thtnk about ghat your
 
Hempstead black church would love the very, best of all -
-- what would s
nake them
  
feel that their music was as fine as they know underneath that it is.  Maybe you
 
could help put out a record that they could sell to raise money for their
 
orphanage fund.  Maybe you could help them
, get on to a local radio prograr.
 
Maybe they'd like to invite other local choirs in for a sing-off or a song-feat.
 
FolV Arts could help you bet money to do any of the Above ideas, and any other
 
similar motions that might strike you and the folks as workable, and your own
 
research costs could be included in any such project.  If you want to go on as
 
an independent scholar, you'll have to go to Humanities.  The person to write
 
to there i

your outrage at the use of ASCAP of these files of copyrighted
 
tunes to extract funds from the Folk Festival,  I think that the
 
festivals themselves might get in more trouble than it would be
 
worth for them if they tried to fight these fees.
 It seems that
 
the size of the fees would be sufficiently small so that it would
 
not be worth anyone's while to fight them.
 However,  I think that
 
it would not be out of place for me to write a letter to ASCAP
 
seeking an explanation of why they have decided to descend on
 
promoters of folk music festivals at this point.
 I would be glad
 
to consider signing a letter which you would draft that might go
 
into questions of the impact of these fees on small music producers
 
Such a letter I would think would have to include some general
 
explanation of the normal or customary size of an audience, the
 
average ticket price if any, and the average number of performers
 
and the amount paid to these performers,  if any.
 
There is also here,  it seems to me, a second matter and that is
 
the question of copyright of music which is recorded.
 This one
 
seems to me an even more difficult case.
 If there are a number
 
of folk music producers who are issuing recordings or who wish
 
to become more active in the issuing of recordings, i
.
't would seem
 
to me that we are in a position of providing them with better
 
information on how to obtain speedy information on copyrights.
 
But we certainly are in no position to advise anyone interested
 
in recordings to not heed the copyright laws.
 Please, both of
 
you, give me your response to these hastily prepared remarks.
 
Thanks.

convinced of this position that they tend to look for the inclusion of such an

puts on a full-time position of this sort.  It makes funding local projects
 
infinitely easier for us, and it will ultimately save the state money as well,
 
assuming what I know to be true, that Oregon wants folk arts activities con-
tinued.
 
Please keep me informed of your discussions with the Governor's office.  I

Subject:  Fellows for Folk Arts
 
To follow up on our conversation, after conferring with Bess Hawes and Bob Teske
 
we concurred that the Summer term would be ideal as a regular time to have a
 
fellow.  Would it be possible to establish this as a time we may plan on to
 
have a fellow in order to systematically advertise the availability of fellow-
ships among the most promising potential applicants?  It would be a great help
 
to us in our program planning.
 
Also, if possible, we would like to request that a fellowship slot be made
 
available for the Fall term of 1981.
 
Thank you very much.

Subject:  Hispanic Funding by Folk Arts, 1975-7@
 
One grant on the attached print-out, the "Spanish Education Development" in
 
the District of Columbia, should not be credited to Folk Arts.  On the other
 
hand, the computer missed one:  to El Centro Campesino Cultural i
n S
an Juan
 
Bautista, California for a $5,000 grant in FY 1977.
 
I have attached also a list of Folk Arts grants concerning Hispanic arts,
 
that were also directed and staffed by Hispanics, but where the sponsoring
 
organization was not Hispanic.  I am not surprised that the computer did not
 
pick them up.  The 1
976 East Los Angeles Community Union grant, for example,
 
concerns Boyle Heights (
the barrio section of Los Angeles), the project was
 
directed by Alicia Gonzales, the results were published in Spanish, but the
 
word "
Eispanic" did not appear even in the grant description.  We now are
 
trying to describe projects so that their minority participation and impact
 
is clear in the project description itself, but going
; back through all those
 
old grants requires expert attention from program staff familiar with then.
 
I really think that we must be very careful in these statistical reports:
 
the difference between b grants (
from the computer) and 15 grants (
from program
 
records) i
s a significant variation.  All this assumes, as I commented at the
 
meeting, that you were not simply interested in economic Impact or something
 
of the kind.

Dear Mr. Ripley,
 
I Write in some concern following our brief interchange after your splendid
 
dinner party for the American Folklife Center Board.  If you recall, I
 
brought up the issue of bilingual education -- a not very appropriate topic,
 
it occurs to me now, for a well-filled and appreciative guest to raise on
 
the very doorstep.
 
'
q
ty only excuse i
s that the subject is of critical importance, and widely
 
misunderstood.  Let me propose a '
simple solution", one which would turn the
 
whole issue on i
ts head, and bring a nex perspective to bear on the problem.
 
Let us advocate boldly that now is the time when the educational system in
 
the United States should dedicate itself to the goal of making every child
 
in this nation -
-- majority and minority -- bilingual.  Almost every other
 
nation in the world requires of its children sore proficiency in two, and
 
sometimes more, languages.  Such an official poliev on our part would enable us
 
to join the world commmity on a r
wme equal footing.  It might even improve
 
our diplomacy.
 
V
ie have led the nations in the task of making every citizen literate.  Let us
 
now
* raise our sights even farther.  Every child in American schools can be
 
enabled to acquire a reasonable proficiency in English (
our national language)
 
and it one other language.  Thus, while
 Chippewa-speaking students are studying
 
English, rnglish-speaking children can be learning Spanish, French, or Chippewa.
 
as appropriate.
 
You are a scientist.  Let me give you two case histories.
 
Case A
.  Bess Lovax Hawes was taught to read at the age of four (
in English,
 
her native tongue), and instruction in Latin was begun at the age of six.  By
 
the t
ime I Was ten, I was half-way through Virgil's Aeneid in t
he original
 
Latin, had polished off Caesar's Gallic Wars, and had had six menthe instruction
 
in conversational French.  I was regarded as educationally advantaged, and I
 
concur with that opinion.  I was not exactly bilingual, but I was certainly
 
linguistically experienced.
 
a
 
2
 
Case B
.  "Maria ronzalez", a graduate student at the California college where
 
I taught, was born in the Los Angeles barrio and reached the age of six speaking
 
only Spanish.  She was put into s school where instruction was given only in
 
English and managed, by herculean efforts, to learn to read in a language that
 
she did not, at the time, understand.  I respected her enormously.  One day I
 
asked her casually what books she had read in Spanish while she was growing up.
 
She said, none.  I said, well, a newspaper, magazines?  She said, none: there
 
weren't any.  With increasing incredulity, I discovered that she had never known
 
that Don Ouixote had originally been written in Spanish; she had never heard of
 
Lorca's poetry, nor of the work of any Latin-American novelist.  I took her to
 
the Spanish literature section of the college library and left her there,
 
bemused and weeping
:.  She had never before realized that real books had actually
 
been written in her own language.  Marin had been classified as educationally
 
disadvantaged, and I concur with that verdict, too.  She was linguistically
 
far more sophisticated than I
, but she had received educational maltreatment of
 
the first order.
 
U%at irony.  What educational malpractices, what ethnocentric brutalities have
 
gone uncorrected under the guise of "AmericanizinÂ¢'  the foreign-born and their
 
children.  Of course, English is our national language.
 (
So it i
s in rhana and
 
in Nigeria, as far as that goes.)  Of course, every American citizen must learn
 
a reasonable competency in our national tongue.  But we could also require that
 
every Am
erican child learn that other languages exist, that these languages are
 
in every case noble attempts by different kinds of r
ten to communicate their own
 
especial view of reality and of man's destiny, that the study of these varying
 
tongues will enrich and refine our ability to express the ultimate human truths.
 
Within this context, our "foreign-speaking" students might eventually come to be
 
regarded as assets to our society, rather than deficits.
 
I speak with passion, because you are an important intellectual leader, and your
 
words are heeded.  This is a time when reaction i
s more seductive than action.  I
 
too am weary of the sometimes shrill and tendentious voices of the many, many
 
have-nots that surround us.  But this seems to me a moment when boldness just
 
might work, when a straightforward and clear call t
o the future might set us on
 
a new path, might re-shuffle the weary contending forces and unite us in a rew
 
cause with a new perspective.
 
Anyway, I
've tried.

MEMORANDUM

, 1980
 
To:  Livingston Biddle
 
Mary Ann Tighe
 
Donald Moore
 
From:  Hess Lomax Hawes/Folk Arts
 
Subject:  Attached Draft Agreement
 
You may recall that, at the request of t
he Hoard of Trustees of the American
 
Folklife Center, the Federal Council has been spearheading the development of
 
an inter-agency memorandum of understanding on matters connected with folk
 
culture.  Four representatives of the agencies involved -
-
-- Ralph Rinaler
 
(
Smithsonian), Alan Jabbour (
Libra r
y of Congress), the National Fndowment for
 
the Humanities (
Patricia HcFste and/or Sally Yerkovich) and Bess Hawes (
National
 
Fndowment for the Arts) have been working on this document for some time now.
 
Don Moore helped us get it started: Debbie Sales i
s responsible for achieving
 
this final draft.
 
We seem to be close to sign-off time.  I do not feel you will find this document
 
in any way objectionable, but I would appreciate your giving it a careful
 
review.  My only reservation is that the other agencies, especially the rational
 
Endowment for the Humanities, were a bit more prolix than we were.  I suppose
 
we could claim equal space and put in some tangential information, but I hesitate
 
to elongate an already hefty document.  Maybe it would be good politics, though.
 
I believe this is as far as I myself can go on this matter, and would appreciate
 
your tatting the problem over or giving me instructions an to what should be
 
c
lone next.

Dear Me. Staley:
 
Thank you for providing; the Folk Arts Pr "ram with t
he manuscript One Hundred
  
Years Old, Goin' on Two Fundred by Dr. Roy Edwin Thomas.  While the various
 
interviews included in the manuscript are extremely interesting and informative,
 
they do not include much of the traditional narrative material -- the Jack tales,
 
tall tales and local legends -- which would place thec
a within range of Folk Arts
 
Program support.
 
Since the primary focus of Dr. Thomas' collection is oral history, I would
 
recoumnd contacting the State Historical Society, the State Rumanities Council
 
or the history department of the state university regarding possible support for he
 
the project or archival resources which might be ra
ade available.
 
I an sorry that the Folk Arts Program cannot be of more direct assistance with
 
the dedicated work of Dr. Thomas, and I sincerely wish you the best of luck in
 
identifying other sources of support.

Dear Ms. Searles
 
Thank you for your interesting proposal.  I am enclosing Polk Arts guidelines
 
for your reference and use.
 
I do have so
 
s
ee concerns about how our advisory panel will react to your idea.
 
Normally, we do not f
â€¢M4 activities where the principal investigators are high
 
school students, feeling that such projects fall under the domain of the office
 
of Education.  As a matter of fact, we rarely fund school-based projects at all,
 
except in the specific category of "Artists-in-Schools" where we have occasionally
 
funded short-term residencies for important local traditional artists in both
 
elementary and high schools.  Finally, the Folk
. Arts panel has often been
 
hesitant to fund first-tireâœ“ festivals, feeling that federal funding i
s more
 
appropriate once an event has become established as of high quality and the
 
sponsoring agency has a "track record.
'.
 
I have mentioned your letter to Worth Long, who i
s a member of our advisory
 
panel, and suggested that he drop by to see you and discuss the entire project.
 
I
le said that he would be happy to visit With You -
-- indeed, he said that his
 
daughter attends the Boggs Academy[ -- when he finished his worn with
 the  Delta
 
Blues Festival in  Greenville.  Perhaps he's already stepped by, and discussed
 
the above issues.  I hope that he and you were able to work something out, since
 
I do feel the spirit of your proposed festival is entirely consonant with our
 
guidelines.
 
If you've not already not with North, or i
f he does not come by during the next
 
week or two, please get in touch with s
ae again by letter or by phone, mnd I will
 
try to find him for you.  Should you want to call me, you can phone person-to-

Dear Mr. Dauenhauer:
 
I was happy to hear that the Tlingit and Aleut liturgical music project i
s
 
going along well.  I have asked our program administrator, Martha Ru
+enhold,
 
to arrange a full year's time extension for you.  I realize you may complete
 
your work far before that, but in case you run into further problems, you now
 
have as much time as we will hope you could possibly need.  So that is one
 
worry out of the way.
 
Concerning your c
assette c
opying problem, you might pet in touch with Suzi Jones
 
at the Alaska Arts Council for suggestions on in-state facilities.  She is the
 
new Native American Arts Coordinator, and a person of great energy.  The two
 
of you should certainly be acquainted.
 
If you have to go out of state, Dr. Frederic Lieberman, who has just rotated
 
off the Folk Arts panel, might be able to be of help.  He is a professional
 
ethnomusicologist and in charge of the ethnomusicology prograan at t
he University
 
of Washington in Seattle.  They have an extensive archive and dubbing facilities
 
there and Fred has expressed interest in starting
; a cassette distribution
 
operation out of the University Ethnomusicology Archive.  In fact, he may already
 
be doing i
t.  You might want to drop him a line (
I believe he was on the panel
 
when your particular project was reco meaded, so he should be familiar with it).
 
if you choose to call him, he can be reached at his office at 246/543-0974.
 
I hope matters continue to go well.  Please keep in touch, and don't hesitate
 
to write again if we can provide any more information, or if neither of t

Dear Mr. MAchab
 
Thank
, you for your interesting proposal.  I an sorry to have taken so long
 
in responding.  In part i
t was because I do not really know quite how to
 
evaluate this project.  It is certainly well-planned; however. I am not
 
at all sure it fits the Folk Arts guidelines, s copy of which is enclosed
 
for your convenience.
 
In general, the Folk Arts advisory panel has not funded pond wows on the
 
grounds that the pow vow r
_ovemmt, as you point out, is in extremely healthy
 
condition, and most such events are already self-supporting.  The Panel has
 
made an occasional exception in areas such as Ohio where the pow wow custom
 
had died out or never caught on, but in general feel that federal support
 
might be almost harmful in the case of well-established events.
 
The Pacific Northwest situation i
s again different.  It appears to me
 
from your discussion that you are setting up a series of scheduled pow vo w
 
with more of an eye to the Angle than the Native American community.
 (
This,
 
of course, is a perfectly all right thing to do: I
'm just wrestling with the
 
problem of vhere your project might best fit within the Endowment.)
 
Another point to note is that the performers you mention, with the exception
 
of the Cape Pox Dancers, are interpreting the dances of many tribes, again,
 
(
the way I see it) for the benefit of the general public.  The primary
 
concern of the Folk Arts Program, however, is to get funds back to highly
 
traditional artists within the tribes.
 
All in all, I wonder if this is not a project that would better fit into
 
the P
.xpansion Arts guidelines than Folk Arts?  You can of course apply to
 
us anyway, this is sixmly staff opinion, and the ultimate decision is
 
not in our han0a but the responsibility of our panel.  If you do decide
 
to apply to us, since I
've been so slow is awwering, feel free to e
mail
 
the for d in any time during the first week of October, we won't hold
 
strictly to the October 1 deadline.

Dear Mr. Dilley,
 
I an sorry it's taken me so long to pet back to you.  U
le just completed an
 
out-of-town panel meeting the planning and execution
, of which absorbed far too
 
such staff time.  It's left us way behind in our day to day business.
 
I
'm enclosing the current Polk Arts guideines and will assume, unless I hear
 
otherwise, that you will be sending in an application for our October l
,deadline.
 
Don't go into a panic; we are not hard-nosed about deadlines.  Anytime the
 
first week of October is fine with us.
 
This morning I spoke
s with Jane Beck, the Folk Arts Coordinator at the Vermont
 
Arts Council
., and was delighted to hear that you may be working with her.  She
 
may be able to add the element that t felt to be missing in your application --
living traditional artists.  (
By the way, I was first alerted to their comrarative
 
absence by noting in your budget that you scheduled no artists' fees.  I really
 
think you should plan to use them and pay them at least an honorarium.)
 
And, speaking of the budget, it is really pretty substantial for our Program.
 
If there could be any way to scale 3t down, especially in terms of the federal
 
share, I believe the project would seem more feasible to the Folk Arts Panel.
 
You might consider thinking about reducing the number of programs; another
 
approach would be to try for additional outside funding.  For example, I should
 
think the Vermont Arts Council might be interested in supporting such a palpably
 
home-grown project.
 
I shall look forward with interest to seeing your completed application.  In

Dear Jim,
 
I
'm sorry to be so slow in Betting back to you, but we've had a deadline, a
 
panel meeting (
out of town), a conference, and, for all I know, a Council
 
meeting since you wrote about your friend who i
s interested in the eastern
 
North Carolina Indian tribes.  Things have been a bit blurry lately.
 
I
've called the '
forth Carolina Polk Arts Coordinator, an extremely bright,
 
competent, and deceptively baby-faced young man named George Holt.  He thinks
 
(with me) that this gentleman might be talking about the Lumbees and other
 
associated tribes that have lost so much of their tribal identity that they're
 
heainning to fight hard to maintain -- and in some cases get -
-- federal
 
recognition.  He seemed very interested in talking with your friend's brother,
 
and also commented that he might do well to get in touch with the Director of
.
 
North Carolina Humanities Council, a gentleman who shares this interest.
 
George himself can be reached at the North Carolina Department of Cultural
 
Resources, in Raleigh (
27611).  Telephones 919-733-4867.
 
I hope this begins to fill the bill.  Unless it's an optical illusion, things
 
nova faster and faster around here.  I oould, of course, be moving slower and
 
slower, but my staff loyally assures me it isn't true.  I do miss you.
 
Affectionately always,
 
Hess Lomax Hawes

P.S. I
'd be very interested in hearing what, if anything, happens with the above
 
project.

Dear Mr. Palmer,
 
Just a note to thank you once again for making my visit to the Kiowa headquarters
 
so extremely pleasant.  It was a high point on my whole southwestern trip,
 
and the extraordinary peace of the Kiowa brush a
rbor will long remain in my
 
mind.
 
The following day, Clydia and I visited the Kiowa t
ips exhibit in Oklahoma
 
City.  I thought it extremely impressive, and I also thought it was in t
he
 
wrong place.  It should have been set up close to Kiowa country.  (
Please
 
be assured I an not being critical: maybe this was the only place that could
 
have been agreed upon.)  Still and all, I an concerned that the Kiowas themselves
 
may not realize how extraordinary this exhibit is, and how important it is that
 
they see it for themselves.  Do you think that bus expeditions might be arranged,
 
at least for the elders and also for Kiowa schoolchildren?  If money is a major
 
factor, Folk Arts might be able to help out.  Please give me a call -- 202-634-4282,
 
and make your call person-to-person collect, and I will call you back on the
 
federal line at no cost to anybody.
 
Thanks again for your hospitality and kindness.  I am enclosing a copy of our
 
current brochure in case I forgot to leave one with you.  Please get in touch
 
if we can be of assistance in any of your future projects.  Often we are able
 
to help funnel things that don't fit our particular guidelines to the right
 
place, so don't be hesit r
it to send us new ideas.
 
Yours very sincerely,

Subject:  Chairman's Actions
 
You may notice an unusual number of Chairman's Actions from Folk Arts
 
during the next few days.  This s uns from the fact that we accepted only
 
emergency applications for review at the September policy panel meeting.
 
Out of 22 applications reviewed, 8 had special time problems requiring that
 
they be handled via a Chairman's Action.
 
Please note also that all the grant requests are out of 1981 funds.
 
These are normal routine requests -- Folk Arts' business-ae-usual --
rather than obligations of leftover 198Â© monies.

Dear Ms. Adams,
 
Thank you for your letter.  The f
laida basketmaking film sounds very interesting.
 
I am enclosing our current guidelines for your use along with some other Folk
 
Arts material that you might find helpful.  We are feeling pleased with our
 
new brochure; I
'll put in several copies so that you can give them out to
 
anyone interested.
 
Concerning your application, our next deadline for completed forms is October 1
.
 
V
ie will need a sample of the worts of your film makers by November 15; we will
 
return it in a month.  I must warn you that, because of the high costs of film
 
and video productions, the panel has gotten very choosy about funding in this
 
area.  They will only support technically first-class and culturally sensitive
 
f
ilm producers, so the selection of your sample film is very important.  The
 
panel generally only has time t
o look at about ten minutes of the sample films
 
shown, if you l
ike, you can let us know which part of a longer film or videotape
 
you would especially like them to s
e
re.  We have facilities for showing both
 
films and videotapes.
 
If you have any difficulty with the application, please don't hesitate t
o get
 
in touch with us by letter or phone.  As you probably know, you can call us
 
person to person collect at 202-634-4282 and a staff member will get back to
 
you on the federal l
ine.  Martha Kuenhold, our program administrator is the best
 
person to speak with on budgetary proble m
s.  Also, in a conversation with
 
Susai Jones at the Alaska Arts Council, she said she would be very happy to
 
discuss the project with you i

This is just a note to thank you for your hospitality of last week.  It was
 
a real joy to see the Kiowa tipi exhibit so beautifully mounted and so
 
respectfully presented.  It had been a very long negotiation, and there had
 
been times when I thought we shouldn't get it up at all.  So it was a triumphant
 
moment for me.
 
I have written the Kiova cultural folks suggesting that they should try to
 
set up bus tours for their seniors as well as their school children to copse see
 
this exceptionally fine exhibit.  I hope they follow through on the suggestion.
 
Please let me know if you think there is anything else I can do to let people
 
know what an ippressive job you have done.
 
I shall enclose a copy of our n
earest brochure in case there might be some other
 
way in which we can cooperate with the Kirkpatrick Center.  Please don't

I

You might wish to consider re-applying for our next deadline (

of the Library of Congress cyllinder project materials.  Another possibility
 
is to re-apply for our April 1 deadline by which time the Library of Congress

budget that you proposed for the application that was rejected.  I shall enclose
 
a copy of our new guidelines for your use in case you decide to reapply.
 
I am sure you understand that your application was rejected not because the
 
Folk Arts panel felt the project was not needed, but because it simply could
 
not be accomplished in the way you described and budgeted until the cyllinders
 
were copied and available for your use.  It was a problem of timing, not of lack

Dear Mr. Glasser,
 
I am sorry your letter of July 15 was not answered.  It had been my impression
 
that the sow telephone conversations between Folk Arts staff (
Bob Teske and
 
Dan Sheehy) and your office had covered your request adequately.
 
However, as they, I
'm sure, told you, the primary difficulty with your appli-
cation was money.  Our 1980 budget was actually slightly less than the moneys
 
we had available to grant in 1979, and we had almost twice as many highly
 
worthy applications.  The situation was thus extremely competitive.
 
Within that context, the panel tried to spread our small amount of money around
 
to cover as la me a constituency as possible.  Your application might quite
 
possibly have been recommended in a less competitive year.  However, they felt
 
that the Eisteddfod seemed to be a campus event; you also seem to employ a
 
significant number of so-called "revival" artists.  As our guidelines explain,
 
we feel our primary responsibility is to the artist that the revivalists learned
 
from, and, being a revivalist myself, I approve this position as both just and
 
fair.  Finally, the panel was concerned with the large increase in federal
 
funding that you were requesting.  Our panel has generally tried to work with
 
events t
hat showed the possibility of becoming
, self-sustaining, and tends t
o
 
resist applications that suggest an expanding need for federal dollars.
 
Please bear in mind that a rejection by the Folk Arts panel does not mean that
 
either the application or the event was disapproved of.  There are many worthy
 
projects that we are unable to fund every year.
 
May I extend my personal best wishes for the success of your program.
 
Sincerely,

My personal delight in Black quartet singing goes back to the late thirties
 
and the early forties.  Those were golden years in New York now that I think
 
back on theca.  My husband and I were young and we were broke, but, if we picked
 
the right night and fell into the hands of a friendly head-waiter, we could
 
stand in the back of any of S or 6 clubs in town and listen all evening long
 
to such fabled musicians as Sidney Bechet, Mildred Bailey, Mary Lou Williams,
 
Count Basie, Fete Johnson, and -- always my personal favorite -
-- the Golden
 
Gate Quartet.
 
Listening night after night to the Gates, I became fascinated with the range,
 
the brilliance, and the subtlety of the unaccompanied quartet fora as perfected
 
by Black singers.  It seemed to me a whole new musical style, and my husband
 
and I made many journeys up to Harlem's Apollo Theater where almost every
 
Sunday they would hold a day-long contest for gospel quartet singers.  Along
 
with other families, we would unpack our picnic lunches and sit in t
he old
 
Apollo listening; to one incredible group after another.  I have longs since
 
forgotten the names of the singers we heard there; I will never f
orgot the new
 
vistas their music opened for me.
 
Now almost fifty years later, i
t is both a
ny honor and my special personal
 
delight to participate in the sponsorship of a Black quartet reunion in the
 
city of Birmingham -- the seedbed from which such a remarkable musical style
 
grew and flowered.  May this concert signal a new renaissance of Black gospel
 
quartet singing, one of the unique gifts Black musicians have made to the
 
greater public joy and the spiritual harmony of this nation and the world.

Subject: Possible Conflict-of-Interest
 
Mr. Herman Martinez of Adams State College in Alamosa, Colorado, has requested
 
that I consult on a film project they are planning for 1981 in southern Colorado.
 
The subject of the film, Hispanic musical traditions indigenous to the area,
 
relates directly to my area of expertise as an ethnomusicologist -- Hispanic
 
music of the Americas.
 
The possible conflict-of-interest arises out of the fact that the filmmakers
 
plan to apply to the Colorado Council on the Arts and humanities for a humanities
  
grant in support of the project. They wish to pay me an honorarium f
or my
 
services, and I would be quite willing to take a leave of absence from  my
 
position at the Endowment to help them out -- specialists in this type of music
 
are practically non-existent.
 
To my knowledge, these folks have not received a grant from the Arts Endowment
 
and have no intention of applying in the forseeable future.

Dear Mr. Eels:
 
You may remember that during the cocktail party at the last National Council
 
meeting, we had a brief discussion about a Native American cultural project.
 
If I may refresh your memory, it concerns the old cyllinder recordings of
 
American Indian music made during the 1880-1920 period and stored since then
 
in various federal repositories including the Library of Congress, the s
tational
 
Archives, and the Smithsonian.  Copying these ancient cyllinders onto tape is
 
an urgent necessity; they are fragile and drying out with age, and, for an
 
extraordinary number of Indian tribes, they represent a storehouse of song and
 
r
ausics now almost entirely lost from h
:mman memory.
 
The American Folk Life Center at the Library of Congress has already begun the
 
task of re-recording these cyllinders; it will take another year or year and a
 
half of devoted effort and somewhere between $50,000 to $75,000 dollars to
 
complete the primary task
..  After that, the humanities Endowment will be able
 
to help various archives across the nation with funds to obtain copies of the
 
entire collection, while the Folk Arts Program may be able to assist specific
 
tribes to get copies of their own material for further dissemination.  Until
 
then, the Library needs to raise money for the basic copying effort.
 
Enclosed is a letter and background materials from Alan Jabbour, director of the
 
American Folklife Center who is charged with the responsibility of raising the
 
necessary funding for this effort.  I hope you will be able to give him some
 
assistance.  It's a really extraordinarily worthy cause -- an absolutely unique
 
resource not only for our Native American citizens but for scholars and musicians
 
of all peoples.
 
Yours sincerely,
 
Dess Lomax Hawes
 
Director
 
Folk Arts Program
 
P.S.  Please don't hesitate to call  me directly if there is any further
 
information I can provide.  My Endowment number is 2026634-4282.

Dear Hr. Costigliola,
 
Thank you for your letter.  I am enclosing a copy of the current Folk Arts
 
guidelines f
or your use.  Our next application deadline is October 1
.
 
In completing these forms, please give a summary of your project in the box
 
on the first page, but you should also feel quite free to attach any additional
 
information that would strengthen your application.  Our panel of advisors is
 
quite bard-working and will read through anything you s
end along.  I would
 
suggest that you be pretty detailed about the artistic forms you intend to
 
include in your  Pow Wow and their traditionality among the Narragansetts
 
and other invited tribes.  Names and brief vitas of participants and organizers
 
are helpful.  If you plan to use consultants such as anthropologists or
 
folklorists, modest fees can be included in the budget for their services.
 
I
'd also suggest you address the issue of the Pow Wow as a traditional form
 
of celebration among the Narragansetts.  Our advisory panel has tended to feel
 
that Plains--type competitive pew vows are and have been self-supporting for
 
so long that they probably should continue that way.  Our funds are to extermely
 
small that we tend to conserve them for projects where federal assistance is
 
absolutely essential.  Finally, our basic goal is to help sustain living
 
traditional art forms against the onslaught of popular western European culture.
 
We try to use our funds wisely, to build on what is there rather than start off
 
large projects that may eventually fail when the outside dollars are no longer
 
available.  k
'hat I
'm suggesting here is that starting
, small and building up
 
might be a good way to think about your project assuming this i
s a first-time-
in-a-long-time event.
 
I hope some of the above suggestions are helpful.  After reading the guidelines,
 
if you have further questions or if you need assistance in filling out the
 
application, please don't hesitate t
o write again or t
o call 202-634-4282,
 
person-to-person collect.  Your call will be returned on the federal line at
 
no cost to you.

To:  Adrian Ding
 
From:  Bess Lomax Hawes
 
Subject:  Grants from Folk Arts to Individual Women Artists
 
Attached is the data we could assemble.  Please note:
 
1
)  Apprenticeships are the only awards to individuals now offered
 
through Folk Arts.
 
2
)  that Folk Arts did not give apprenticeship awards until 1979;
 
we inherited the category with Folk/Ethnic Music which joined
 
us that year.
 
3
)  the Folk/Ethnic grant files (
which we also inherited along with the
 
program) are pretty much in chaos and it would take many, many
 
staff hours to extract what I firmly predict would be not especially
 
dazzling results.  As I recall, the Folk Music Program never awarded
 
more than eight or ten apprenticeships to anybody, male or female,
 
in any single fiscal year of its brief existence.

 Request from the Presiden
 
on the Status of Women
 
s Commission
 
A member of the staff of the President's Commission on the
 
Status of Women has requested that the Endowment provide
 
the Commission with information pertaining to grants to
 
individual women artists.
 
In talking with some of you, we find that most of the
 
programs which give grants in the form of fellowships,
 
internships,  etc. have kept records indicating the sex of
 
the recipients; however,  it doesn't seem that the information
 
has been pulled together to give an over-all Endowment
 
picture.
 
Could you please provide us that information by the end of
 
August,  showing  (as far back as your records show)  the total
 
number _of
_ grants to individual artists,  the number for
 
women,  the dollar amounts, on a year =by-year basis?
 
Thank you.

Dear Ms. Thomas/Sekatau,
 
You have probably totally forgotten writing; me by now.  I am awfully sorry to
 
have taken so long in anvaerinS your letter, but it somehow got lost between
 
me and the wrong office of the Humanities Endowment and only just now resurfaced.
 
it appears that you might be able to get support for a project on the history
 
of the Narragansett Indians from the General Research Program of the National
 
Endowment for the Humanities under a category called "State/Local/Regional
 
Studies".  I have just spoken to one of their program officers whose name is
 
Nadina Gardner, and she asked that your letter be forwarded directly to her.
 
She will herself get in touch with you and advise you how to proceed.  (
In
 
case anything goes wrong again, you can reach her by phone at 7
24-0276.)
 
I might also mention that I received an enquiry as to the possibility of Folk
 
Arts funding assistance for a Narragansett Pow Wow from a committee composed of
 
Narragansett Indians and cabers of the university of Rhode Island faculty-
ataff-student com = ity.  Apparently this event is being planned for May of
 
1981, and a
cme kind of historical arts presentation eight well fit into their
 
plans.  The gentleman who wrote me is Frank Costigliola, Chairperson, URI
 
Native American Committee
,, and he is apparently attached to the Department of
 
History.  I just thought you might be interested in case you didn't already
 
know of the effort.
 
I
 
Again, my  apologies f
or the unconscionable delay.  I hope all goes well with the
 
Humanities folksy they sounded very positive when I read them your letter over
 
the
. phone.

Dear Carole,
 
Your letter of May 9 has just washed once a
ttain to the surface of my cluttered
 
desk.  It's been a bad summer.
 
I discussed your application to the Dance/Film/Video category with some of the
 
Dance Program officers as well as with a few of their panel umbers.  I think
 
you have an extremely interesting idea there and want you to know I supported
 
i
t.  I don't really know ghat happened with it in the Dance Program, but you
 
might want to consider s
ebsitting it to Polk Arts as well.  Please bear in mind
 
this is only staff reaction, and I don't know how the panel will feel, but you
 
might want to take a chance.
 
Two points you might want to consider further.  It so me to me awfully low in
 
budget.  Do you think you can construct a coherent file dealing with these
 
extremely subtle points and still focus on two ethnic groups in one 20 minute
 
film?  I wonder i
f it might not be wiser to limit yourself to one, at least
 
to start with.

Assistant to the General Counsel
 
Implementation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
 
42 U.S.C.  2000d et seq. 
Livingston L. Biddle,  Jr.
 
Chairman
 
I.
 The Law
 
The National Endowment for the Arts is responsible for
 
carrying out its programs and activities in accordance
 
with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,  42 U.S.C.
 
2000d et seq. 
Title VI provides that "no person in the
 
United States shall,  on the grounds of race,  color,  or
 
national origin, be excluded from participation in, be
 
denied the benefits of,  or be subjected to discrimination
 
under any program or activity receiving Federal financial
 
assistance."
 
II.
 Agency Responsibility for Implementation
  
Responsibility for enforcing Title VI rests with Federal
 
agencies authorized to extend financial assistance.
 How-
ever,  Executive Order 11764,  promulgated January 21,  1974,
 
delegated to the Attorney General authority to coordinate
 
and assist agency enforcement efforts,  to prescribe
 
standards and procedures regarding enforcement,  and to
 
issue necessary regulations and orders.
 Based on this
 
Executive Order,  the Justice Department issued regula-
tions,  28 C.F.R. 42,  Subpart F,  setting forth minimum
 
requirements for implementation of Title VI by Federal
 
agencies with grantsmaking authority.
 As stated in the
 
regulations,  steps to be taken by Federal agencies in order
 
to ensure compliance with Title VI include:
 (
1)  submission
 
of proposed Title VI regulations and regulation amendments
 
to the Attorney General;  (
2) publication of guidelines
 
regarding the application of Title VI to assisted programs;
 
(
3)  public dissemination of Title VI information,  including
 
in appropriate situations material in languages other than

English;  (
4)  requiring recipients to maintain adequate records
 
and to submit data
, and information sufficient to permit effective
 
enforcement of Title VI;  (
5)  establishing procedures for pre-
grant and post-a
.pprova
.l reviews of compliance with Title VI
 
requirements;  (
6)  establishing procedures for prompt investiga-
tion and disposition of complaints;  (
7)  requiring recipients
 
and applicants to remedy existing discrimination;  (
8)  estab-
lishing procedures for promptly resolving noncompliance and
 
reducing to writing the remedial action agreed to be necessary;
 
and  (
9)  requiring Federal agencies subject to Title VI to
 
develop a Title VI enforcement plan.
 
III.
 Present Endowment Title VI Enforcement and Compliance System
  
The National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities issued
 
regulations under Title VI July 5
,  1973,  38 Fed. Reg. 17991
 
(
1973).
 These regulations recently have been revised to
 
reflect amendments suggested by the Office of Coordination
 
and Review  (OCR), U. S. Department of Justice.
 The proposed
 
amendments are under review by OCR,  and will be published in
 
the Federal Register for public comment in the near future.
 
To date,  the Endowment's efforts in connection with implemen-
tation of Title VI and Foundation regulations have consisted
 
of including language in program guidelines regarding the
 
necessity of complying with Title VI and requiring an assurance
 
of compliance form signed by an authorized official to be
 
submitted by all grantees.
 Also,  a statement recently has
 
been included in program guidelines requesting information
 
from applicant organizations regarding minority involvement
 
at the artistic,  administrative, board,  and audience/participant
 
level.
 Complaints against recipients alleging violations of
 
Title VI have been investigated by the General Counsel's Office
 
in accordance with procedures set forth in agency regulations.
 
So far,  all complaints received have been resolved through
 
informal negotiations.
 
IV.
 Proposed Enforcement and Compliance System
  
In the past,  although certain actions have been taken to
 
implement agency regulations under Title VI, no administrative
 
mechanism currently exists for determining Title VI compliance
 
Livingston L. Biddle,  Jr.
 -3-
 August 25,  1980
 
of applicants for and recipients of Endowment financial
 
assistance on a systematic agency-wide basis.
 Consequently,
 
it is recommended that the following steps be taken,  in
 
accordance with Department of Justice guidelines,  to improve
 
and strengthen the Endowment's Title VI enforcement activities.
 
A.
 Increased Public Dissemination of Title VI Information
  
The Endowment and its recipients through the use of
 
posters,  manuals,  pamphlets and other material,  should
 
make available to the public more information regarding
 
the non-discrimination requirements of Title VI.
 The
 
material could summarize Title VI requirements,  note the
 
availability of Title VI information from the Endowment
 
and recipients,  and explain briefly the procedures for
 
filing complaints.
 
B.
 Data Collection
  
In order to monitor civil rights compliance,  relevant data
 
and information should be collected from applicants for
 
and recipients of Federal assistance.
 In accordance with
 
Department of Justice regulations,  a Directive recently
 
issued by the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights,
 
and office of Management and Budget "Interim Guidelines
 
on the Collection of Characteristic Information on
 
Applicants for Benefits" the Endowment must begin requiring
 
recipients engaged in sub-granting activities,  e.g.,  state
 
arts agencies,  regional organizations,  and other grantees,
 
to implement procedures for determining the race and ethnic
 
background of persons applying to their programs.
 The
 
Department of Justice has been informed that an Endowment
 
Directive is being developed which will require recipients
 
engaged in sub-granting activities to request relevant
 
data from applicants applying to their programs.
 Preliminary
 
discussions between the General Counsel's Office and the
 
Director of State Programs regarding the Directive have
 
taken place.
 It is anticipated that a document outlining
 
data collection requirements and procedures will be drafted
 
by the General Counsel's Office in close coordination with
 
the Director of State Programs and representatives of the
 
National Assembly of State Arts Agencies.
 
Livingston L. Biddle,  Jr.
 
-4-
 August 25,  1980
 
C.
 Pre-Award Review of Applications for Civil Rights
  
Compliance
  
According to the Department of Justice,  agency civil rights
 
determinations are not adequately incorporated into the
 
grant approval process of many agencies.
 Certification of
 
civil rights compliance should take place prior to an
 
application's approval for funding.
 Consequently,  applicants
 
should be required to submit assurance of compliance forms
 
for review by the Endowment at the application,  rather than
 
the grant award letter stage.
 
Applications could be reviewed for Title VI compliance by
 
program specialists assigned Title VI responsibility,  and
 
trained in Title VI matters by Department of Justice
 
personnel.
 (A significant portion of the Department of
 
justice's coordination resources have been committed to
 
the provision of Title VI training to agency personnel.)
 
This recommendation is consistent with the following
 
position taken by the Comptroller General of the United
 
States in his April 15,  1980,  Report to Congress,  Agencies
  
When Providing Federal Financial Assistance Should Ensure
  
Compliance with Title VI:
 
"We believe that more program personnel
 
involvement in enforcing Title VI should
 
result in  (
1) better Title VI coverage
 
of assistance programs and  (
2)  increased
 
awareness of the significance of Title VI
 
requirements as an integral part of their
 
assistance programs."
 
In light of current demands on staff time,  pre-award
 
compliance reviews could take place on a sampling basis.
 
A review would consist of the assigned program specialist
 
checking for inclusion in the application of an assurance
 
of compliance form.
 Also,  on a periodic basis selected
 
applicants could be called and asked several civil rights
 
related questions that would flag potential problems,  e.g.,
 
have any complaints alleging discrimination been filed
 
against the applicant.
 In addition,  on a sampling basis,
 
a small number of applicants could be selected for on-site
 
reviews.
 Selection could be based on such factors as the
 
amount of money requested from the Endowment,  the community
 
Livingston L. Biddle,  Jr.
 
-5-
 August 25,  1980
 
served,  impact of the proposed project on the community,
 
the benefit to be received by the community,  or other
 
relevant factors.
 
Any compliance problem arising as a result of the review
 
would be required to be settled by negotiation between the
 
Endowment and the applicant prior to further review of the
 
application by the appropriate panel.
 
D.
 Post-Award Reviews
  
In accordance with Justice Department guidelines the
 
Endowment is required to establish and maintain an
 
effective program of post-approval compliance reviews
 
regarding approved new applications,  applications for
 
continuation or renewal of assistance,  and all other
 
federally assisted programs.
 Where appropriate,  such
 
reviews are to include on-site visits to a representative
 
number of major recipients.
 Reviews would be conducted
 
by designated staff according to established procedures
 
and standards of evaluation.
 Selection of recipients for
 
post-award on-site compliance reviews could be based on
 
(
1)  the number of Title VI complaints filed against a
 
recipient;  (
2)  the cost of the program administered by
 
the recipient;  (
3)  the racial and ethnic makeup of the
 
geographical area served by the program;  or  (
4)  any other
 
factor deemed appropriate by the Chairman or designated
 
official.
 
E.
 State Arts Agencies and Regional Organizations
  
State Arts Agencies and Regional Organizations,  as a
.
 
result of their sub-granting activities,  have special
 
roles in connection with the Endowment's civil rights
 
compliance and enforcement activities.
 As recipients
 
of Federal funds,  state arts agencies and regional
 
organizations must assure the Endowment of their non-
involvement in discriminatory activities.
 Also,  in
 
carrying out their own federally supported programs,
 
these recipients are required to assure that no funds
 
are sub-granted to organizations that discriminate.
 
Livingston L. Biddle,  Jr.
 
-6-
 August 25,  1980
 
In order to monitor Title VI compliance with respect to
 
continuing assistance programs  (
i.e.,  grants to state
 
arts agencies and regional organizations)  application
 
review could include an analysis of previous year's racial
 
and ethnic data as a condition precedent to continued
 
funding.
 
Finally,  to assist states in carrying out their civil
 
rights responsibilities,  model programs or guidelines
 
could be developed that can be utilized by states to
 
monitor civil rights compliance on the part of state
 
grantees.
 Several states have been extremely successful
 
in their efforts to comply with Section 504 of the
 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973.
 In view of the similarities
 
between 504 and Title VI,  it has been suggested that
 
certain states be selected for model projects in connection
 
with Title VI enforcement.
 This would be consistent with
 
the Department of Justice's recommendation that agencies
 
consider consolidating their various civil rights enforcement
 
responsibilities,  e.g.,  Title IX,  504,  into one administra-
tive structure.
 
V.
 Conclusion
  
Implementation of an adequate agency-wide Title VI enforcement
 
and compliance system will require careful thought,  vigorous
 
effort,  and effective utilization of available staff resources.
 
In our view,  no easy answer exists regarding the most efficient
 
administrative means for structuring a
. Title VI or civil rights
 
compliance program.
 However,  regardless of the structure
 
arrived at,  it should be kept in mind that the Endowment retains
 
wide discretion within the requirements of applicable law to
 
design and integrate within its programmatic structure a
. civil
 
rights component capable of exploring the relationship between
 
federal funding of the arts and civil rights and developing
 
innovative solutions and approaches to the new issues raised.

Subject:  Te^tporarq Clerical
. Help for Folk Arts
 
During the past two fiscal pears, Folk Arts' application load has almost
 
doubled.  A further drain on the Program is our heavy, correspondence load;
 
for example, during the past aontb we have received 75 written enquiries
 
concerning possible Polk Arts projects.  Bitter experience has shown us that
 
the eajority of these enquiries should be answered in writing, not by
 
telephone.
 
We're therefore requesting some clerical assistance.  Charles Mixon tells
 
as that we can get a temporary clerk-typist on by October 1 without
 
affecting our  number of slots or violating the presidendial freeze.  I
 
do hope this request can be approved, as does the entire staff.

Folk Arta i
s interested in having two searches run for us, i
f there is still
 
time during the present contract.  We'd be very interested to know if any private
 
foundations are involved in funding cultural activities of American Indians.
 
Secondly, we'd like to know the names of foundations that are interested in
 
historic preservation projects such as the preservation of old buildings or
 
local monuments.  That might turn out to be the same information as you gave
 
Linda Coe; perhaps you could just send us a copy.
 
The American Indian one is the more critical for us; we work with a number of
 
tribes who seem to have little access to private moneys.  The historic
 
preservation is out of Folk Arts' capacity to fund, but we'd l
ike to have a
 
few suggestions to pass on to people who enquire.

 Q
 ï¿½ 
FROM:

Arts Library/Information Center
 
SUBJECT:  Alternate sources of arts funding
 
During the past seven months the NEA Library/Information Center has been
 
supplying answers to requests for information on alternate sources of arts
 
'
fudding.
 In December, 1979, Linda Coe, a Design Arts contractor working
 
on an update of Funding Sources for Cultural Facilities, asked for the
 
names of foundations which had g iven  money
 to  construct, repair and reno-
v
ate arts buildings.***  In May, 1980, Rob Wilson/Challenge asked for the
 
names of the 15 largest foundation givers to the arts.  Later that month
 
Don Druker/ Media Arts wanted a list of foundations involved in funding
 
children's theater and media centers.
 
In order to answer these questions we arranged for computer searches of
 
the Grants data base, a group of 50,000 machine readable records of grants
 
made to non-profit organizations.  This data base, maintained at the head-
quarters office of the Foundation. Center, contains the grants records of
 
over 500 foundations.  We were able to arrange for these fee searches
 
through our participation in the Center's Associates Program; for an
 
annual fee of $
200 we have access to a number of special information
 
services which include telephone reference, duplicating, library research
 
service and data base searching.
 
The purpose of this memo is 1) to remind you that we belong to this program
 
which provides information on foundations 2
) to tell you about successful
 
computer searches we have done and 3
) to ask for feedback on the Program's
 
usefulness to you.  Since computer searches of the Grants data base are
 
subsidized (
with Administrative funds) through the end of the fiscal year,
 
you still have time to try out the service.  If you think it would help,
 
please call or return this memo with a note.  We need your views to help
 
us decide whether or not to renew the subscription.

Dear Steve,
 
go far, we have no printed form on which to nominate our Heritage Award grantees.
 
I had envisioned just a simple: letter detailing Just why you think this or that
 
person has made a significant contribution to the art fora and -- if the individual
 
is very obscure -- a sample or two of the work (
either photographs or tape).
 
We my have to get mores bureaucratic than that; actually I canft at all tell
 
whether we'll be swamped or not.  You're the first person who has even enquired.
 
You can be our guinea pig if you liket
 
Peter Hero says things seem to be moving along veil with Yo".  I
'll try to
 
reach you this afternoon about your new projects; we've been absolutely run
 
off our feet lately.

Fear Anna,
 
I didn't get anywhere with Artpark (
Joanne Allison, that is) just a repetition
 
of what she told you and the Italians.  I didn't want to press too hard in
 
case she turned ugly, but I expect I left her with a larger load of guilt than
 
she had had to begin with.  And serve her right.
 
We more or less left it that neither Artpark nor NFA would make any move until
 
the I
talians let us know what they have in mind.  Joanne feels the June date is
 
a good possibility; grounds-keeping and some similar services would be available,
 
and she believes she might be able to arrange to have the parking lot donated
 
so that the Italians could make a little money by charging for parking.  She
 
also offered the use of the theater in case they want to bring Papa Vanteo's
 
puppet show in.  She says that a modest fee could be charged for the latter and
 
that it would he a good source of income for s
natching
; purposes.  She also
 
offered office space, a desk and phone for a festival organizer, if one is to
 
be hired through grant monies.  She will personally help write up the grant,
 
when the Italians decide what they want to do.  T gather that it would not go
 
through Artpark, however, A
s
o another fiscal agent would have to be found.  She
 
might be movable on that point, but I doubt i
t.
 
The next grant deadline is October 1 for projects Rhheduled to begin in April.
 
This is what you or somebody should push for.
 
I
'm also enclosing a copy of a note from my friend Paul Asciolle.  He said
 
that when he enquired about the college with the Italian Studies Division
 
(
Fredonia Community College, I think it was) all his northern New York friends
 
referred him t
o SURY Buffalo.  Maybe the enclosed information will be of some use.
 
I
'm sorry all this has blown up this way, and that there seems so l
ittle t
o
 
be done a
bout i
t.  I can, of course, make a political stink, and I will i
f and
 
when i
t seems appropriate; I hesitated, however, to take a step that would
 
l
eave really bad feelings behind in case the June i
dea can still be pulled off.
 
Love to F
r
ill and to you, of course, always,
 
Affectionately,

Dear Mollie,
 
Thank you for your letter of June 1
, 1980  regarding the acquisition by the
 
University of California, Berkeley, of the unique collection of Philippine
 
folk arts of former C
,overnor Carmeling Crisologo.  What exciting no w for the
 
Philippine community, for the university, and for all students of folklife in
 
the United Statesl
 
I
'll now have to s
tet bureaucratic on you and any that while the Polk Arts
 
Program i
s prohibited under its guidelines from funding start-up costs for
 
institutes, museums, regional centers and similar service organizations, the
 
Program does fund exhibits, workshops, residencies and various forces of media
 
documentation.  Should your Museum wish to apply for project support in any
 
of these areas once it has been established, we would be happy to help in any
 
way we can.  Sally Yerkovich of the Division of Special Programs at the
. National
 
Endowment for the Humanities onyx their funding capabilities would be much the
 
same as ours, largely lini
.ted to protect support.  '
Wherefore, I recommend the
 
Institute for Museum Services as the most likely source of fiscal :
yelp during
 
the early stages of the museum's development.  Start-up money is always the
 
hardest to come by.
 
I a
nt sorry that we can't be of more immediate use in this exciting project and
 
I sincerely wish you the best of luck in finding t
he necessary initial support.
 
Please keep us in mind for future programming needs.  We would be most happy
 
to help when the right time comes around.
 
Thank you for letting us know the plan and again congratulationsl

â–º
 oor Don,
 
I an awfully sorry things turned out as they did for you this summer.  I wish
 
there was some way that I could convey to you the total problem that we're
 
dealing with -- trying to help t
he cultural aspirations of every Indian tribe
 
in the nation from the largest to the se
mllest, of every island in the Pacific
 
from Hawaii to Saipan, of every part of Alaska, of every ethnic group in
 
Cleveland and Denver and Pittsburg and San Diego, of the Virgin Islands, of
 
Puerto Rico, of the Rockies, of Appalachia, of the deep South -
-
-- everyone and
 
every part of them feeling neglected and demanding their rightful places i
n
 
the sun.  It's a bit like the early days of the New Deal, I expect.
 
The fact i
s, we haven't got the money to fit our constituency.  This last
 
panel meeting, we had to go back and turn down $250,000 worth of perfectly
 
good grants that we just didn't have the money to fund.  And that's when your
 
application fell t
hrough, not because it wasn't something t
hat we'd like to
 
see happen, but because there were too many other things that needed to happen
 
too.  Believe me, the staff and the panel suffers through every single one of
 
these decisions.  They are not automatic and they are not easy.  Your application
 
as wall as a request for funding of the very first recording of Montana folk
 
music finally want down but we did fund a reunion of all the old black gospel
 
quartet singers at a gala concert in Montgomery, Alabama, and the filming of
 
and by the '
"lingits of t
heir tri-centennial ceremonials in southern Alaska.
 
If Jane Ponde
r has any money left over after she helps you out, point her in
 
our direction.

or the comin? summer.  Weill

Bear Jim,
 
The enclosed exeept was extracted from a letter that reached me accidentally;
 
it had been forwarded to my brother Alan by ?
3arry Ancelet and actually was
 
addressed to several other issues not mentioned in the part I copied off for
 
you.  I opened the letter by mistake (
it had come to my horns) but it contained
 
such a clear reference to the concern that you and I have been worrying over
 
that I couldn't resist copying out at least this part.
 
Here we have, i
t seems to me, the central issue that the Folk Arts Program,
 
its advisory panel, and -- goodness '
knows -
-
- all the Palk
. Arts Coordinators
 
deal with minute by minute.  The fact is, we are one miniscule factor in the
 
overall cultural equation, and we have to recognise that and factor our
 
insignificance into a
ll our decisions.  This is why I get so unreasonably
 
angry when we not only muff
, our big chances (
as I still think NCTA did in its
 
selection of Cajun music at the 198(' festival) but we than add to the injury
 
by justifying our mistakes on impromptu theoretical bases.  It's awfully easy
 
to ,
justify anything theoretically.  It's a damn sight harder to try to fight
 
for genuine local auton my against all the forces of the media and the eternal
 
dollar--sign.
 
Honey, I don't know why I am pouring this out on you.  God knows, you have
 
done the most sensitive, and imaginative, and socially constructive job of
 
anybody I know.  I guess that's i
t, in a way.  In r
every sense of the word,
 
you are one of the purest men I know.  I respect your views; I respect your
 
honesty; I respect your eternal careful vigilance for the cultures you know
 
and honor.
 
But our self-assigned job is so hard, it is so hard.  We know just how to wipe
 
out local cultures -- we've been doing it for centuries -
-
- but bow to protect
 
them from our exploitive society is a totally new problem.  That's why these
 
dicussions are so Important.
 
I
'm enclosing a draft planning docul
sent for the folk Arts program.  It is a
 
draft, and I expect i
t to be changed; it is going to nobody (
outside of the Panel
 
and a few Endowment staff) except you, and Nick Spitzer and r
ay brother Alan.
 
Any Ideas you might have for amendments, additions, deletions, anything else
 
that crosses your fertile brain, would be deeply appreciated s
and immediately
 
utilized.

I am sorry to have delayed answering your letter for so long, but, frankly,
 
Z don't have any idea what kind of trandcription machine you are talking
 
about and neither does anvone else I have consulted.  The only kind of tape
 
recorder attachment I have ever worked with, while transcribing, was a
 
foot-step pedal, and I an sure you don't dean that.  Could you possibly
 
mean a device like Charles Seeger's mellograph at U
.C.L.A.?  I don't think it
 
would help in transcribing, though it provides useful information.
 
Pave you spoken with Dr. Gerard Eehague at the University of Texas?  Perhaps
 
;
he could give you advice.
 
With best wishes for the success of your NSF application.

Dear Nancy,
 
I ar
c sorry it's taken me so long to answer your kind and cordial letter.
 
The month of June was a perfect terror -- back to back meetings, many of
 
them lastiar three or four days, wort of them intensive, the others boring
 
but essential.  I find much of my meeting attendance is in order to be on
 
hand to stop somet h
ing bad happening rather than for any wore interesting
 
or constructive purpose.  I suppose that's the bureaucracy for you.
 
,
Anyway, the month of May wasn't all that relaxing either -- the month before
 
a panel meeting never is -- and you panelists had to deal with an extremely
 
tired staff.  I thought you were all r m
sarkably patient with us.  I apologize
 
for popping off (very unprofessional of me, according to Endowment standards
 
of panel-staff relations) and an happy to report t have recovered my usual
 
equanimity.
 
Thanks very much for the reinforcement about the circus grant.  Actually,
 
I didn't so much have a theoretical problem with it as a technical one, with
 
a slight tinge of rolitical concern creeping in there on the side.  I
 
don't approve of worrying too much about politics and an ashamed of myself
 
when I find it has influenced my thinking.
 
The whole interchange however has focussed me on a part of ny job that I
 
have paid disgracefully little attention to.  filling in panel members on the
 
overall structure, strategies, and fiscal situation of the Endowment so a
 
whole.  Many staff reactions are based on a sometimes inchoate and inspecific
 
feeling that somebody else ought to be doing this or that particular job,
 
not us: and I hope we can go into all this in some detail at the September
 
planning meeting.  I intend to produce a document for you called A Polk Arts
 
Eye View of the Endowment, explaining where we intersect with
h other programs
 
in the larger whole.  (
And how much money we have between us.)
 
I an beginning to get excited about the September meeting.  I
'd like us to
 
really lean in on same of the interesting problems:  the urbanized general
 
festivity that typically calls itself a folk festival but is not cultural,
 
in our terms; the urban Indian cultural problem; the pow wow as a cultural
 
form; a real look at the touring issue; several alternative strategies for
 
dealing with "world music" -- (
classical performing arts of no

u
r
o

a

)
-
t
he economic issues involved in the marketing of traditional crafts; the
 
situation in the Pacific Islands.  I
'll be writing you in more detail in a
 
week or so, before I run off for a brief vacation.

The Arts Endowment supports in the strongest terms the general aims and
 
purposes of this bill.  There can be no question that the arts and crafts of
 
our Native American citizens form treasure houses of beauty for which all
 
Americans, and indeed all humanity, must ever be grateful.  American Indian
 
art is known around the world and many t
imes serves to symbolize American's
 
contribution to the arts i
n the great museums of Europe and the far East.
 
As our primary indigenous cultural product, Native American arts and crafts
 
have blazed a trail of beauty down which all humankind can walk.  They are
 
among the proudest cultural gifts of our nation.
 
I
t is thus entirely appropriate for the Federal Government to concern
 
i
tself with the encouragement and the maintenance of Native American art
 
forms and the support and assistance of Native American artists.
 The National
 
Endowment for the Arts i
s proud to report that we have already made at least
 
a small contribution towards this end, by funding projects bringing financial
 
support to Native American tribal and cultural organizations as well as
 
i
ndividual artists through grants from its Folk Arts, Expansion Arts, Museum,
 
and Visual .
Arts Programs.
 (A report from the Folk Arts Program p f
tpared last
 
year for the Congress i
s appended as example.)
 
We are quite aware however that we have not, as a nation, done enough.
 
Support has been fragmentary and essentially disorganized.  We applaud the
 
work of the dative American Arts and Crafts Board and the Institut
.e for
 
American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, as well as the efforts by our sister agency,
 
T
lie National Endowment for the humanities.  We urge the Congress to consider
 
with care the various proposals before it to increase federal support for
 
k
 - 2 -
 
t
hese efforts.  This bill (
S. 2
166) stands as one example; the legislation
 
(
HR
 ) proposed by Congressman Yates as another.  Both should be
 
critically examined.
 
In considering the detail of S
. 2166, there are a f
ew i
ssues that we
 
Sc
- f
 vt,%
 n
i
t 2
.tca
 
recommend be
 with particular attention.  One concerns the location
 
of t
he proposed Institute within the federal structure.
 If conceived of as
 
an independent body, i
ts overhead and administrative costs will be heavy;
 
i
f conceived of as an adjunct within another federal body, congruence with
 
t
he a
ims, purposes, and capabilities of the host agency must be established.
 
This may be difficult in terms of the large variety of varied activities
 
p
roposed for the Institute.
 
A second concern of the Arts Endowment i
s the proposed composition of
 
the Institute's Board.
 I
f the seven federal board members do not vote, the
 
working body of twelve members seems a bit small "too provide an appropriate
 
regional and t
ribal representation".
 I
f the federal members are given voting
 
power,(an awkward responsibility for a representative of another agency) the
 
Board will probably be controlled by an Anglo majority since the twelve
 
Presidential appointees need only include seven Native Americans.  This would
 
seem inappropriate f
rom t
he point of view of the Arts Endowment.
 
Finally, we respectfully urge in considering any legislative remedy that
 
t
he Congress make every effort not to raise American Indian hopes once again
 
without making t
hem possible of accomplishment.
 Strong fiscal support is
 
especially i
mperative f
or t
he activities outlined in S
. 2
166.  The establish-
ment of an American Indian Arts and Craft Museum alone would more than eat
 
up the sum mentioned in the f
inal paragraph and we know that both the American
 
Indian Arts and Craft Board and t
he Institute for American Indian Arts have
 
been and are still underfunded.
 
However, a serious, purposeful, well-supported program to coordinate the
 
various federal efforts in support of American Indian arts and crafts has
 
long been needed.  We reiterate our support for this general goal and pledge
 
our cooperation i
n attempting t
o address these l
egitimate and long-neglected
 
needs.

Dear Clydia:
 
I thought you would be interested in seeing the enclosed report from Charlotte
 
on her visit with the Cherokee.  Charlotte is currently on vacation In
 
Alaska; I spoke with her just before she left and she sounded happy as a
 
girl.  She'll be back in another week, I believe, and the better f
or a rest,
 
I expect.
 
By the way, I have received an interesting proposal from an organization
 
called Indian Arta and Crafts Association in Albuquerque.  Do you know
 
these people?
 
Lastly, have you thought more about the CANA problem?  I think we should
 
talk during
, early August about whether or not you intend to revise the
 
application that vent to the June meeting.  (
By the Way,  Charlotte did not
 
get a copy at the panel meeting; she had gone back to her room sick and
 
I didn't notice that she had not received i
t.  I sent b
eer one in the mail
 
two weeks ago, and I expect she will call you on her return from Alaska.)
 
Anyway, i
f you do intend to revise t
he application, I should hear from you
 
before we put the panel book to bed.
 
I shall be on vacation from July 25 to August S
, but Dan and Bob will be
 
minding the store, so don't hesitate to call
..  I have given Dan all the
 
CATRA material, so he will
. be up on the situation.
 
Take care, and f

Dear Mr. Morgan;
 
Gerald Mess forwarded your letter to o
ne a
long with his response.  I have
 
delayed answering myself because, frankly, I don't quite know what to say.
 
I believe Mr. Ness enclosed a copy of our Informational booklet; if you
 
can frame up a proposal that fits our guidelines, we would, of course,
 
be happy to entertain it.
 
You might also wish t
o consult with George Rolt, Folk Arts Coordinator at
 
the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources in Raleigh, or with
 
his associate Glenn Hinson.  They might possibly know of state funding
 
resources that I ar not f elliar with.
 
I have one other possible suggestion.  You mention in your article that
 
there i
s a *
ark in the Vwharries.  Many national and state parts employ
 
people to word: at interpretive centers explaining the physical and cultural
 
ecology of the park area to visitors.  You might possibly enquire if such
 
a position would be open at t

very seriously and very well and are charmingly decorative in their national

wouldn't be expensive to invite them, and it would be nice to demonstrate
 
the Endowment's interest both in Asians and in recent refugees.

be more expensive (

these are virtuoso performers on harp and guitar, the music itself is stirring

not to say thrilling, and besides, it would fit in with one of our "favorite
 
success stories" to follow.
 
All the above are experienced Performers, visually and aurally appealing,
 
not too far out for a general audience, and could stand up well within an
 
atropphere of ballerinas and opera s

Al.  In 1478, Filk Arts awarded a grant of $20,167 to the Tennessee ?
?epsrtment
 
of Conservation, Division of Parks and Recreation.  This grant supported
 
the summer-long
.
, hiring of three energetic young folk arts experts to
 
establish a network of contacts with traditional artists resident in the
 
areas serviced by s
ix Tennessee state parks.  A series of mini-events
 
from local f
iddle contents to quilting bees were organized in each park,
 
displaying, neighbor-to-neighbor fashion, the extraordinarily high level
 
of artistic performance available within the local community i
tself.
 
Exhibits of folk art borrowed from local residents and displays of old
 
photographs and memorabilia loaned by c
emmmnity members were rvunted in
 
park museums and interpretive centers.  Documentary materials developed
 
during the project include 15{0 hours of audiotape â€ž
 1500 slides, and
 
2
204 black and white negatives, all of which have been deposited in the
 
State Library and Archives in Nashville for further community use.  A
 
second summer program
. In 6 different parks is now in progress.
 
The project was joyfully received by local residents as well as 1
j
y the
 
managers of the individual parks, who were enormously gratified at the
 
increased public use of their facilities f
or artistic purposes.  The
 
project received, additionally, the f
irst annual Award of Merit from the
 
Tennessee Association of Museums, an award created to recognize and
 
encourage high standards within the museum profession in t
he state.
 
Finally, i
t has received national recognition as anfinalist for the
 
J
.L. Flaherty award f
or Park Excellence, in competition with national
 
and state parks all
. across the country.  (We're specially pleased about
 
t
hat, because most of the finalists were for projects like multi-million
 
dollar buildings, huge parking facilities, and the like.)

This was written up by Dan Sheehy.  I thought his romantic California
 
style was so distinctive it's forwarded to you unedited.)
 
Jose Gutierrez is one of the most skilled exponents of music& Jarocha, a
 
style of traditional music considered by many to be the most upbeat and
 
exciting regional musics of Mexico.  Born and raised on a l
arge ranch south
 
of the port city of eerzcruz, Sr. Gutierrez is an excellent representative
 
of the rich mixture of Hispanic and Afro-Caribbean heritages that make
 
the local culture and muilc so unique, extroverted and intensely creative.
 
Under the critical eye of his father and grandfather, musicians of great
 
renown in the area, Sr. Outierrez developed into a master musician at
 
an early age.  He was soon recruited by Mexico's most famous Verzcruz
 
instruments -
-- erpa, requinto, and jarana (
diatonic harp and two unique
 
regional types of guitar) -- as well as a f
ine improvisor of spontaneously
 
composed verses and an expert insttatement maker.
 
-3-
The temptations of the heart eventually led him to the Los Angeles
 
area, where he married and took up residence.  Tragically, in Los
 
Angeles, he could not find sufficient employment withU his musical
 
skills and was forced to take employ mnt with a sauna bath company,
 
applying his abilities as an instrument maker to piece together wooden
 
bath structures, while occasionally performing for various social
 
occasions in the Mexican barrio.
 
Early this year, four prospective students of music& jarocha in the
 
Los Angeles area received grants from the Folk Arts '
Program to study
 
with Sr. Cutierrez.  The ewney received through these apprenticeship
 
grants has allowed him to relegate his sauna--making labors to a part-
time activity in favor of teaching his skills to young Mexican-Americans,
 
as well as making more insta ments.  Another grant reconnended by Folk
 
Arts and awaiting approval by the National Council on the Arts and the
 
Chairman to the American Society for pastern Arts in San Diego will
 
provide an institutional contact through which he will be able to augment
 
his musical activities to nearly a full-time occupation.  Hopefully,
 
in the fullness of time, Jose Gutierrez will become a #ajor cultural
 
resource in California's Mexican-American community.

Senate bill 2166 "To promote the development of Native
 
American culture and art"
 
Larry Chernikoff
 
1
.  The Arts Endowment should support the aims and purposes of this bill.  The
 
preamble is first-class and entirely in consonance with our own agency goals.
 
2
.  There are, however, a number of proble m with the bill as spelled out:
 
a
.  It has no institutional or agency base.  If conceived of as
 
a separate agency entirely on its own, it will need physical space
 
and overhead and administrative funds in quantity.  If i
t i
s conceived
 
of as an ad_1unct within the Smithsonian or the Library of Congress,
 
support costs might be less but congruence with the aims and purposes
 
of the host agency must then be established.
 
b
.  Section 4 (
b) was written in line with the pattern of the Board
 
of the American Folklife Center.  This was a mistake; the A?r Board
 
has been a disaster.  To extrapolate the problems onto this bill,
 
there are seven Board members from federal agencies:  Interior, Education,
 
Smithsonian, NFA, M . Library of Corgress and the President of the
 
Institute itself.  As a federal representative on the American Folklife
 
Center Board, I find i
t extremely awkward to be a voting board member
 
within another federal agency.  Representatives of other federal agencies
 
should sit on this Board in an advisory capacity only and should not vote.
 
I
 If this change is not made, I must point out that the Board will undoubtedly
 
be controlled by an Anglo majority, since the twelve Presidential appointees
 
need only include seven Native Americans, (
a majority of the Public
 
sector group).  I also query whether a working voting board of twelve is
 
big enough to "provide an appropriate regional and tribal representation
 
on the Board" (
p. 4
, lines 12 and 13).  I should think a group of fifteen
 
would be better (
assuming the federal representatives don't vote).
 
c
.  The list of potential activities on page 8 are nifty but seem
 
unrealistic in the light of the total funding suggested on p
. 10, line 2
4.
 
A
 American Indian Arts add Crafts Board (
now in Interior) and the Institute
 
for American Indian Arts in Santa Pe are scheduled, according to this
 
bill, to be t
ransferred into the Institute (
see P
. 9
, Sec. 6
).  Their
 
current combined budgets are in the neighborhood of $3,000,t10t?, leaving
 
only a million to start a Native American art museum, set up a center
 
for American Indian scholars, begin an inter-American Indian exchange
 
program and all the rest.

My general view is that we should be wary of getting Native American hopes
 
up yet another time, if the Congress is n
ot p
repared t
o support the Institute
 
appropriately from the begirming.  Other than the above, I think it's a great
 
idea, and most of my Indian friends and contacts do too.

Dear Bob:
 
WRSHInGTon
 
D
.C. 20506
 
A Federal agency advised by t
he
 
National COuncil on t
he Arts
 
Thank you f
or your gracious and cordial letter.
 I
'm always made happy when
 
other people share my view of the whole extraordinary picture these panel
 
meetings represent -- the simultaneously comical and inspiring sight of the
 
United S
tates government solemnly worrying away about what to do to preserve
 
basketry among t
he Klicketats (
about 35 of them left) or black childrens
 
street games (
millions of them), or elderly circus performers, for all of that.
 
When I feel sufficiently desperate or ignorant, or confused, I get fanciful.
 
We're trying t
o catch butterflies with cast-iron skillets.  We're building
 
hummingbirds nests with bulldozers.  We're trying to change the course of
 
t
he Mississippi River by carefully emplanting a single pebble in the center..
 
Any or all of the above...  Anyway, I
'm so glad you f
ind the experience
 
stimulating and interesting, and I am personally and professionally honored
 
that you have agreed to join us in our improbable enterprise.
 
Concerning our slight altercation, which shall not be forgotten but remembered
 
for the greater insights and the greater mutual esteem it will bring to our
 
joint endeavors, I guess there were two things that concerned me.  One,
 
I don't want any member of this truly remarkable group to feel that they have
 
been selected solely because they are from a minority population.
 I
've been
 
the token woman on too many committees not to feel the edge of that particular
 
sword.  I
t's both humiliating and frustrating, because it means you are not
 
being taken seriously.
 
The other i
s more complicated.  I have for some time been presenting the argument
 
within t
he Endowment that panel participation by minorities (
class and regional
 
as well as e
thnic) was crucial because of their important contributions to
 
understanding t
he social effects of what we do, but not necessarily the cultural
  
effects.  To put i
t crudely, the Endowment cannot "
take care of" Hispanic
 
culture (
however we may be defining i
t this year) by routinely requiring a
 
Spanish surname on every panel.  I have been trying hard to get the more alert
 
and concerned people in the Endowment to think seriously about Mexican and
 
Puerto Rican and Cuban art forms in the United States, not just about who is
 
"Hispanic" and can relieve t
he political heat.  That's too easy.  We mustn't
 
be allowed t
o get by with tokenism.
 
In bolstering this position, I have postulated the existence of "cultural
 
experts" who may or may not have been born into the culture but who have in

Just a quick note before I leave to tell you once again that the entire session
 
with the panel was again a stimulating and very rewarding experience.  Bob and
 
Dan certainly have much to do with the success of these sessions, and their
 
sensitivity to the whims as well as the areas of/ignorance of the pane
l mem
bers  
is superb.  Most of th e cre di t shou ld go to you, however.  Nobody understands
 
as well as you do the peculiar combination of talents and emotions represented
 
by that group, and I cannot imagine anyone who could keep the group in focus
 
as well as you have.
 
I am sorry that I pained you with my remark about the minority participants.
 
But remember that it was my remark and not yours.  While I agree entirely with
 
the position you stated,  it is really difficult to convince me entirely that
 
people like CharlotteyWorth and myself do not bring an important element to
 
the panel, which I think is vital.
 I think that Nancy and Council generally
 
tend to see things along the same lines.
 I do not mean to imply that there is
 
any fundamental kind of schism on the panel, but only that in the large mix
 
of attitudes and experiences in the panel, there is at least one set of these
 
that comes over a little stronger with some members of the panel than others.
 
It was probably inappropriate for me to put it the way I did, but I hope that
 
this will help to clarify what I meant at least a little.
 In the end, because
 
of a really healthy climate of discussion, I think everything turned out remark-
ably well, all of which is to the credit of both you and the members of the
 
panel.
 I am continually impressed at what a fine mix it really is, but also
 
concerned about maintaining this balance and about whom we suggest to join the
 
the panel next year.
 
I sent a short note to Don Moore with copies of some things I have written
 
which may have some bearing on the cultural pluralism issue and with a promise
 
to take a note pad with me on my trip to China.
 I was very much impressed
 
by Don.
 I hope his willingness to listen will result in some healthy develop-
ments for the Endowment.
 
All the best to you and the staff.

Subject:  American Folklife Center reauthorization
 
The attached memo was sent me by Alan Jabbour for comment.  Since it
 
pertains to reauthorization of the American Folk-life Center, I wondered
 
whether the Arts Endowment should not respond formally, and such a response,
 
i

Subject:  Computerized Rejection Letters
 
We haven't had much trouble with the salutations, as far as I recall, but I
 
have long taken strong exception to the look of the computerized letters.
 
The erratic spacing is a dead giveaway, it seems to me.  I wonder if there
 
is not some better machine we could afford?  The personalized advertising letters
 
I get in the t
rail look much better than ours, so there is clearly in existence
 
some sort of higher quality hardware than we possess.

To:  Marcia Sartwell
 
From:  Bess Lomax Hawes
 
Subject:  Attached newspaper stories
 
Should you, by any chance, be looking for another Folk Arts story in future,
 
perhaps the attached clippings and report would be helpful.  This is one of
 
our bigger projects (
funded last year for the first time, and being repeated
 
this summer).  We like i
t because it, a
. is good quality and b
. puts folk arts
 
in a nice summer-time setting - the network of state parks in Tennessee.
 
Another nice feature is that it represents a cooperative effort between the
 
feds (
in this case, us) and a whole consortium of state agencies.  Peaceful
 
collaboration i
s our motto.
 
Please return the clippings and report when you've used them.  And if you
 
don't like this i
dea and need others, don't hesitate to call.
 
Then, Marcia, I wanted to thank you specially and specifically for the
 
Apprenticeship flyer.  I think it turned out splendidly, an opinion that is
 
snared not only by all the Folk Arts staff but also the entire panel, who
 
asked me particularly to congratulate the publications office on how elegant
 
and professional i
t looks.  We are doing a mass mailing this week and will let
 
you know how many flies we catch with this dollop of honey.  Again, my personal
 
thanks for your editorial skills and for your pushing the whole thing through
 
in such fine style.

Subject : Panelist Replacement
 
Carl Petrick , Idaho Arts Agency chairman and SAA representative on the Folk
 
Arts panel, has informed me that he has resigned his state position to accept
 
a job with the Western Arts Alliance.  He has therefore submitted his resig-
nation from our panel as well.
 
With your concurrence , I should like to urge Carl to remain on the panel
 
until December 31, 1981 at which time three other Folk Arts panelists will
 
be rotating off anyway . He has been a hard-
-working and helpful panelist,
 
I
'd like to keep him on, and my strength fails me at the thought of trying
 
to find another SAA representative in mid-year.
 
Any problem with this?

Anna Chairetakis, whose address is:

I am sure she will answer you directly.
 
I wonder if Anna Chaves' interest has really waneedt  My impression is that she

her head.  Have you been in touch lately?
 
I look forward to seeing you in Pittsburgh,.

Dear Ms. Hawes,
 
I am writing to you about a set of papers which we presented under
 
the collective title of "Women as Mediators" at AFS last fall, which you
 
may remember attending.  At the time, we were all extremely grateful for
 
your favorable criticism and encouragement that we try to publish the papers.
 
Anna Chaves and I
, who had organized the panel, undertook to do so, with
 
Anna taking most of the
 r
esponsibility for the preliminary organization.
 
We were also interested in finding one or two other papers for inclusion,
 
if appropriate material could be found.  I believe Anna mentioned to me
 
that you had mentioned some similar work which- your niece(I believe) was
 
doing.  I am sorry this is so vague, but at the time Anna was handling
 
contacts and so I did not note the information down as I should have.  At
 
any rate, Anna has recently brought her paper out in JAF, as you may have
 
seen, and her interest in the project seems to have waned.  I am trying to
 
pick up the threads and would appreciate it if you could pass the word on
 
to your niece (
if indeed it was she) that we are trying to do something on
 
this subject, if she has anything appropriate she
. would like to submit for
 
possible inclusion.
 
We are hoping to have a prospectus to send out to publishers by the
.
 
end of the summer, and so I am asking people who were not panel members,
 
who might be interested in submitting a paper, to send me a draft (
need not
 
be final, but should be an accurate representation of main points and general
 
structure) by August 1
, or mid-August at the latest.  This is rather short
 
notice I know, but the effort has been in limbo all winter, and we would like
 
to get on with it.  If your niece is interested, and/
or if she needs more
 
information a
bout the general theme, could you please ask her to drop me a
 
note at the above address to let me know?  We had envisioned a maximum
 
finished length
- of about forty pages, but shorter papers would of course
 
be fine.  I would like to thank you again for your support and advice at the
.
 
meeting -- it was very heartening!
 
Sincerely yours,
 
Margaret Mills

Heritages Fasearcher
 
Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe
 
Tokeland. WA  98390
 
Dear Mr. Bills,
 
Thank you for your letter enquirin? about the Folk Arts Progras and about the
 
possibility of applying for a ^rant to acquire Shoalwater
 HDy languapes and
 
literary materials from the s
tational Antliropological Archives.
 
Technically speaking, such requests should more properly be funded t
hrough the
 
archives division of the National p
:ndoament for the Hum f
titieaes.  However, in
 
actual fact, fen tribal archives can match the requirements set up by H'
.FI, so we
 
have occasionally stretched our own guidelines to help out.  You may also be
 
interested t
o know that during early December s 
is sponsoring a conference
 
to discuss the archival problems of Native* Anericen tribes, and a r
_ev joint
 
P
3 WREH policy may emerge from that meetinpr.
 
However, as you have probably hearO from Jeff Gamble, the Shoalwater Bay tribal
 
records do not seem to be complete.  The tribe, in fact, has yet to close out
 
a 1
971 grant from the Folk Arts Program (
a very small one) and I believe has
 
also not concluded a grant from the Humanities Fudowment (
a vary large one).
 
I do not, of course, have the full M: information, but I believe Jeff is
 
sending you all the material we have on the W
. A grant.
 
All this makes we feel a bit nervous about your new project idea. though of
 
course the Fro3ram continues to want to be as helpful as possible is the
 
Shoalwater Bay tribe.  I would suggest that you do what you can to clear up
 
all old grants business first.  Then, when you decide to apply to the Folk
 
Arts FropTam again, I think you should try in the body of the application to
 
assure our reviewing panel that there will be some continuity in t
he handling of
 
the proposed project.  For example, has the Heritages Committee begun to carry
 
out any of Jeff Titon's rocos
aa
siendations for conserving and archiving the
 
materials already collected t
mider our grant?  If you could bring us up to date
 
on such matters and also describe the archival procedures you've adopted, it
 
mould be properly cared for.
 
I shall enclose a copy of our program brochure, a leaflet announcing
: our
 
apprenticeship program which you can post, and a copy of our Ruidelinees for
 
your use in applying to us.  Jeff has expressed %
rilliurness to advise you by
 
phone, if you have further difficulties either with the old p
â–ºrant or the new
 
.
.2 _
 
application; and of course I should be glad to helr
. too.  Please feel free to
 
call ne person to person collect at 202-634--4282, and I will return your call
 
on the federal line at no cost to you.  My associate, Richard Keeling, v m1d
 
also be glad to help: he can be reached at the same number.

Enclosures
 
P.S.  Martha Kueuhold, our progran administrator, has .
'
just checked the Shoalwater
 
Bay grant with our grants office.  The original grant was made March, 1973 for
 
a sum of $1,810 for "support to record the verbal sits traditions of Shoalwater
 
tribal umbers".  It was amended in November of 197â‚¬3 to add another 92 0000 to
 
the original grant.  No final report has been received.  Craut funds have been
 
paid in full, the final installment payment having left this office in November
 
of 1979.  Incidentally, the grant vas wade not to the tribe but to the Nampsch'ats
 
Commmity Foundation.  I hope this information helps.
