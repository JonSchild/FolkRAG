BEHIND THE SCENES, 
As sung by W ILL. MORTON. 
When but a 
little boy, oh, it really was my joy 
To visit the theatre, I'll admit, 
And how happy I 
would be, the performances to see 
While seated in the gallery or pit. 
I 
fancied all was real, that the curtain did reveal, 
But since that I 
have passed beyond my teens ; 
I 
begin to understand, though in front it may look grand 
It's very different just behind the scenes. 
So if if you will attend for a 
moment, now my friends, 
I'll do the best within my humble means, 
To show to you to-night., though in front it may look bright, 
It's very different just behind the scenes. 
The comedian is one, who, while causing lots of fun, 
His heart may yet hang heavy in his breast ; 
And he who plays the king, though it seems a 
curious thing, 
In private may be very poorly dressed. 
Then the ballet girl so fair, who goes floating through the air, 
And looks like little angels there instead ; 
Sometimes they have to roam, into a 
wretched home, 
And oftentimes go supperless to bed. 
And those who play the parts, of the men with stony hearts, 
And look as if their tempers were like fiends ; 
Could you see them while away, you certainly would say 
They're the mildest looking men behind the scenes. 
Now there's many a 
married pair, I've no doubt you are aware, 
Who in public are so tender and so kind; 
But could you only see them at home in privacy, 
A 
very different state of things you'd find. 
Sometimes it is the wife who causes all the strife, 
Sometimes it is the husband who's to blame ; 
,11,1111+
. 
4 
But be that as it may, who causes all the fray, 
Their quarreling continues just the same. 
And oft they try to hide from all the world outside, 
The snarls and jars with which their household teetn:. 
And often when you hear them call each other dear, 
They hate each other just behind the scenes. 
Now, its just the same in life, though what lots of care and 
strife. 
And suffering sonic folks will undergo 
Just to cut a 
shine, and to make themselves look line, 
They think of nothing else but outside show. 
Some fancy and suppose, that those who wear good clothes, 
Always are they richest and the best ; 
But an honest heart and mind, is respected most you'll timid, 
No matter whether rich or poorly dressed. 
Then no matter where we go, from the highest to the low, 
From peasantry ' way up to kings or queens. 
Whatever we enjoy, there's something to annoy, 
If we could only peep behind the scenes.

SOMETHING IN THE CITY. 
Sung with great success by W ILL H. 
MoRms, with Harrigan 
and Hart's Combination. 
I 
live up town in Harlem, 
Every morning out I 
crawl, 
Perhaps I 
come to town, 
Perhaps don't come at all. 
My movements are uncertain, 
And curious folks I 
pity, 
For they would like to know quite well, 
0 
What I 
do in the city. 
Spoken—My neighbors can't find out what I 
do for a 
living; 
they have all come to the conclusion, however, that I 
do— 
CHORUS. 
Something in the city, 
Something in the city, 
They don't know quite, they think they're right, 
Something in the city. 
(Repeat.) 
Some say that I'm a 
banker, 
Or deal in foreign wares, 
Some say that I'm a 
broker, 
Among the Bulls and Bears. 
Some say that I'm a 
lawyer, 
But all the maidens pretty, 
Think that I'm a 
preacher, or do 
Something in the city. 
Something, etc. 
Perhaps I 
meet with Smith, 
We talk about the weather, 
Up comes Brown (you all know Brown), 
We have a 
drink together. 
When I 
am gone, Brown says " who's he?" 
" 
That's Johnson, very witty," 
"What does h do?" " Bless me if I 
know, 
Spoken— Oh, yes! he does— 
Something in the city. 
Spoken—It's been remarked in my neghborhood that I 
was 
in the lottery business, and the young ladies they all say I'm 
on the press. 
But they are all wrong. 
Now I 
tel you confi-
dentially what I 
do for a 
living. 
Every time I 
go down town, 
I 
do—well— 
Something, etc.

GIVE THE WORKINGMAN A 
CHANCE. 
As originally sung by W ILL H. 
MORTON, at Howard Atheneum, 
Boston, Mass. 
Some boast of wealth and riches, but give me the hardy hand, 
Give me the honest workingman, the pride of every land; 
The man that earns his living by the sweat of labor's brow, 
That wields the axe, the pick, the spade, or stands behind the 
plough. 
I 
love the sons of manly toil, they built up our success, 
And made a 
mighty nation of this western wilderness; 
Unto our bright protecting stars they nobly did advance, 
For well they knew our flag would give each workingman a 
chance. 
They spanned the mighty prairie, they enriched the American 
soil, 
They built each railroad in the land, these sons of hardy toil; 
In vain did other climes compete, our vessels swept the sea, 
For labor was our bond of strength, bright labor, strong and 
free. 
I 
envy not the titled lord, nor yet the man of wealth, 
I'd rather have the sinews strong, that tinge of ruddy health, 
That labor gives to all her sons whose watchword is advance, 
What made our great success—we gave our workingman a 
chance. 
Let England send her hardy sons, to them we'll give the hand, 
We can't forget that Washington sprang from the motherland, 
Let Germany her thousands send, to leave their sunny Rhine, 
And Russia, from her icy plains, in countless thousands join. 
Let Ireland send each manly form, no tyrant here does stand, 
A welcome sweet we'll give to all in our bright Western land, 
Come from the home of Lafayette— the sunlit hills of France, 
For ' tis our greatest joy to -give each workingman a 
chance. 
DOWN AMONG THE DAISIES. 
Written by W. A. HUNTLEY, banjoist, for W ILL. H. 
MORTON. 
Down among the daisies, by the running stream, 
Where the waters ripple soft and low ; 
Sitting with my darling, in a 
happy dream, 
Heedless of the hours that come and go. 
There I 
meet my darling every Summer's day 
And the leaflets nodding up above 
Were the only ones that list to what we'd say, 
As we whispered o'er our tales of love. 
C 
HORUS. 
Down among the daisies, by the running strew, 
Where the waters ripple soft and low; 
Sitting by my darling, in a 
happy dream, 
Heedless of the hours that come and go. 
Down among the daisies we will ever dwell, 
In a 
little cottage by the stream ; 
Naught will ever come to break the happy spell, 
Break the happy glimmer of our dream. 
Days may come and go, like flowers that bloom and die, 
But as long as life is with us queen, 
We will dwell together, you and I, 
Down among the daisies by the stream. 
Down among the, etc. 
TWO ORPHANS, 
Composed and sung by P. J. DowNEv. 
Air.—" Over the hills to the Poor-House." 
The evening's bright stars they were shining, 
The moonbeams shone clear on our land, 
Our city was in peace and quietness, 
The hour of midnight near at hand. 
But hark! do you hear that cry? 
Fire ! 
How dismal those bells they do sound; 
Our Brooklyn Theatre is burning ! 
Alas, burning fast to the ground. 
CHORUS. 
We ne'er can forget the " Two Orphans," 
Bad luck seems to be in its wake, 
It seems it were brought to our city. 
The lives of our dear friends to take.3 
The doors they w-._Te open at seven, 
The curtain was rolled up at eight ; 
Them that had got seats they w( re happy, 
Outside they were mad that were late. 
The play it went on very smoothly, 
Till sparks from the scenes they did fly; 
It's then that men, women and children, 
"Oh, God, save our lives !" they did cry, 
Wc ne'er cRn, etc. 
Next morn in amongst those black ruins, 
Oh, God! what a 
sight met our eyes 
The dead they were lying in all shapes, 
Some there that none could recognize. 
Poor mothers there weeping and crying, 
For sons that were out all that night; 
Oh, God! let their souls rest in heaven, 
Amongst the innocent and bright. 
We ne'er can, etc. 
What means this large gathering of people, 
-Upon such a 
cold dreary day? 
Or what means this long line of hearses, 
With tops plumed in feathery array. 
Far out to the cemetery of Greenwood, 
' Where the wind makes the lone willow sigh, 
'Tis there where the funeral is going, 
The poor unknown dead there to lie. 
We ne'er can. etc.

GOD HELP OUR SUFFERING POOR. 
Written and sung by W ILL. H. 
MORTON with HARRIGAN & 
HART'S Combination. 
While the sad cry of hard times resound through our land 
Do we give enough thought to the poor; 
Are we one and all ready to lend helping hand, 
To drive the grim wolf from the door. 
The selfish may think that kind fortune has dealt, 
With them and theit own to secure 
The comforts and blessings that money can bring, 
But God help our suffering poor. 
There are plenty we meet who could help if they would, 
But the fact is their money's all spent; 
They're too poor themselves, or they ain't in the mood, 
Or some other excuse they'll invent. 
But ask yon rich banker how much in his vaults 
These men have placed there to secure; 
And he'll tell you, if honest, their assertions are false, 
They could help our suffering poor. 
Can any one tell why those seeking for aid 
Always pass millionaires with distrust? 
Can it be solemn truth, what I've often heard said, 
That the rich seldom give e'en a 
crust? 
But there's the mechanic and laboring man, 
Ever ready to share his small store, 
For nearly each one knows how ' tis himself, 
God bless these true friends to the poor.

MANY CAN HELP ONE. 
Sung nightly by W ILL. H. 
Mott-fox, with HARRIGAN ,S
.; HART'S 
Combination. 
Some very good sayings I've heard in my time, 
And some I 
believe to be true; 
The subject I'll mention to-night in my song 
Is one that is well known to you. 
Should you meet a 
man that is down in the world, 
And assistance you can't give him any, 
Rgmember that many can always help one, 
While one cannot always help many. 
A 
man may be wealthy one end of the year, 
The next one be wretched and poor, 
lie struggles his hardest to keep himself up, 
But has sunk down to poverty's door. 
To such worthy men, ' tis a 
terrible blow, 
So give it to those most in need, 
For you who've experienced poverty know 
'Tis a 
very hard battle indeed. 
I 
hope what I've mentioned to-night in my song, 
That nothing I've said out of place ; 
A man though he's poor may still honest be, 
For poverty is no disgrace. 
So give what you can with a 
generous heart, 
We don't know how soon things may turn; 
Give him a 
diance to rise up in the world, 
And your kindness he'll surely return.

DORKINS THE ACTOR. 
Written by BOBBY NEWCOMB, and sung with great success by 
W ILL. II . 
MoRroN, with HARRIGAN ,,K; 
HART's Combination. 
(New version.) 
The theatre was full, it was Dorkins' night— 
That is, Dorkins was going to play, 
A 
character new to himself and the stage 
That he'd trod for so many a 
day. 
By eight the theatre was perfectly jammed, 
All awaited a 
pleasant surprise, 
For they knew they would laugh till their sides would ache, 
And they longed for the curtain to rise. 
The play soon began, each neck was stretched forth, 
And eagerly watched each eye 
For Dorkins to make his first entrance, and then 
To give him a 
cheerful Hi, Ili! 
He soon appeared amidst loud applause, 
But something was wrong you could see : 
Why Dorkins is playing quite badly to- night, 
The people said sitting around me. 
A 
hiss? yes, it was 7 I 
saw Dorkins start, 
As though stu»g by a 
serpent's fang. 
Then he cast a 
beseeching look all around, 
And his head on his breast did hang. 
Some said he was drunk, and I 
thought so myself, 
For to me it was awful at times. 
To see how he'd struggle along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines. 
At last he the footlights then slowly approached, 
And ladies and gentlemen said, 
Believe me, if I 
cannot please you to- night, 
The faults not the heart but the head; 
Many a 
time I 
made you all laugh, 
When I 
was scarce able to stand, 
And every effort was pain to me then, 
Yes, if I'd raise but my hand. 
You hiss me to-night, and say that I'm drunk; 
From his breast came a 
sob and a 
moan, 
When I 
tell you the reason, I 
know yoll won't laugh, 
I've a 
little one dying at home.

YOUR POCKET-BOOK IS YOUR BEST 
FRIEND. 
Music Published by E. 11. HARDING, 229 Bowery, N. Y. 
Price 10 cents, 
Word:, by ARTHUR W . 
FRENCH. 
12 
Music by A. Cum.. 
There are friends you deem true, they will linger near you, 
In the flush of prosperity's hours. 
But in poverty's day, they will vanish away, 
Like the fading of summer's sA-eet flowers. 
As you journey along in life's turbulent throng, 
While the lull sides you climb or deseend. 
You will see it some day. I 
am right when I 
say 
That your pocketbook is your best friend; 
That your pocketbook is your best friend. 
CHORUS. 
'Tis a 
friend that you need, and a 
true friend indeed, 
Ever ready to give or to lend; 
For wherever you go, you will find it is so, 
That your pocketbook is your best friend; 
That your pocketbook is your best friend. 
Our political life is nothing but strife, 
Where all honor is swallowed in gain; 
But to hint such a 
thing to a 
man of the ring, 
Why of course they would call you insane. 
Many a 
man is in power at this very same hour 
That our honest votes never would send: 
And the way it is done is quite plain to each one, 
Why their pocketbook was their best friend, 
'Tis a 
friend, etc. 
There's a 
gay young cashier, with a 
thousand a 
year, 
And his horses and ladies and wine, 
Oh, he goes at a 
rate quite alarming to state, 
Though he draws on a 
very big mine. 
They discover, some day, he has gambled away 
Many thousands or more, and the end 
Is, they give him a 
year, after that he gets elear, 
For his pocketbook is his best friend. 
'Tis a 
friend, etc.

As sung by BILLY PASTOR. 
If you perceive my bosom heave, 
'Tis caused by proud delight, 
For I'm a 
very different man 
To what I 
was last night. 
For some time in my house a 
nurse 
Has aired her awkward charms, 
But, I'm glad to say, this morning 
I've found something in her arms. 
SPOKEN.—I 
said to the nurse in a 
very innocent sort of a 
manner : " Why, laws, missy, what have you got in your 
arms ?' 
She placed her finger on her lips and said, " 
CIIORES. 
Don't make a 
noise or else you'll wake the baby, 
Don't make a 
noise or else you'll wake the child; 
Don't kick up a 
row or else you'll disturb the infant," 
I 
feel so awfully awfully jolly, I 
think I 
shall go 
wild! 
As soon as e'er the news spread ' round, 
In every neighbor comes; 
Some said ' what a 
darling child!" 
And others " Bless its gums!" 
My feelings were so glorious, 
Describe them no one can, 
And the ladies seem to look on me 
As a 
very clever man. 
SPOKEN.—" Why," said they, " Hr. Snooks, Mr. Snooks, you 
ought to be a 
very happy man;" " I 
am, lam !" I 
replied, and 
I 
would have given away to my feelings and kicked up a 
row, only for the nurse, in her suggestive manner, said 
" 
h—s—h— 
To-day I 
married, so was Jones, 
Who said, quite on the sly— 
" 
Who'll be a 
happy father first, 
I 
wonder, you or I?" 
Jones always thinks he's No. 1, 
But to-day that bliss is mine, 
And when we meet, we'll have some fun, 
crack a 
case of wine. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, 
and I'll 
make Jones drink the darling's 
health, and while he's drinking I'll say, " Jonesey, old boy, 
h—s—h— 
Don't make a 
noise, Jec. 
With a 
parent's fond affection now, 
I 
feel all of a 
glow, 
But what to call the lovely babe, 
I 
don't exactly know. 
I'd like to call him something grand, 
And worthy of a 
Snooks, 
And when he's christened you must come 
And see how nice he looks. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, I'll invite you all to attend the christening, 
but remember, h—s—h— 
Don't make a 
noise, Sc.

ALWAYS ON TIME. 
GRANDFATHER'S CLOCK. 
I 
lead a 
quiet sort of life, 
But still am rather gay, 
And always ready with a 
song 
To pass the time away. 
I'll do my best to please you, 
With my little bit of rhyme, 
And prove for your amusement that 
I 
always am on time. 
fItionus. 
Always on time, always on time,1 
Exact to the minute, I'm always on time ; 
Always on time, always on time, 
Exact to the minute, I'm always on time. 
I 
had some business out of town, 
I 
could not well delay, 
And found there was but one more train, 
To take me there that day. 
I 
quickly rushed, I 
caught the train, 
And as the steps did climb, 
The conductor said, by Jove, young man, 
You're in luck, your just on time. 
Always on time, etc. 
The other aay I 
heard a 
voice, 
That whispered in my ear, 
You'd better take your money out 
That bank, it's very queer. 
That was enough, without delay 
I 
drew out every dime, 
They suspended before noon, 
Once more, I 
was on time. 
Always on time, etc.

My grandfather's clock was too large for the shelf, 
So it stood ninety years on the floor; 
It was taller by half than the old man himself, 
Though it weighed not a 
pennyweight more. 
It was bought on the morn of the day that he was born, 
And was always his treasure and pride ; 
But it stopped short—never to go again— 
When the old man died. 
CHORUS. 
Ninety years, without slumbering, tick, tick, tick, tick, 
His life- seconds numbering, tick, tick, tick, tick, 
It stopped short—never to go again— 
When the old man died. 
In watching its pendulun swing to and fro, 
Many hours had he spent while a 
boy ; 
And in childhood and manhood the clock seemed to know, 
And to share both his grief and his joy, 
For it struck twenty-four when he entered at the door 
With a 
blooming and beautiful bride; 
But it stopped short—never to go again 
When the old man died. 
Ninety years, etc.

I'M SUCH A 
MODEST YOUNG MAN. 
Air—'• Belle aj the Bali." 
THE darling of all the fair charmers, 
I 
am such a 
bashful young man, 
Too bashful I'm sure for to harm one, 
From danger like that I've oft ran: 
The night I 
was born, they told me, 
That my modesty could not be worse, 
would not let my mother behold me, 
And hid all my charms from the nurse. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, I 
was born bashful. 
Most babies generally 
cry when they make their first appearance. 
All I 
did was to 
blush, for— 
CHORUS. 
I'm such a 
modest young man, I 
am, 
I'm such a 
modest young man, I 
be, 
Don't look at me, for I 
blush, you see, 
I'm such a 
modest young man. 
Of course I 
can never get married, 
Too bashful to ask for a 
wife, 
My hopes—as a 
father— is buried, 
Condemned to live single thro' life; 
No helpmate to comfort and cherish, 
No baby to hold on my knee, 
With shame I 
should certainly perish, 
If the thing was suggested to me! 
SPOT:FN.— I 
was very near getting married once, but when I( 
commenced thinking of what would come after, you can bet 
my courage gave way! I 
don't know how these married folks 
manage; I'm sure if it should ever fall to my lot to—to—well, 
you know better than I 
do— I 
should certainly sink through 
the floor, for— 
I'm such a 
modest young man, etc. 
The first pull-back I 
saw made me dizzy, 
At an ankle I 
faint right away, 
A 
striped stocking it sets me crazy, 
And I'm fit for no more thro' the day; 
As ladies walk past when its raining, 
And lift up the skirt gliding by, 
If a 
view underneath I'm obtaining, 
I 
vow I 
am ready to die. 
SPOKEN.— And the more they show, the more palpitating I 
get! 
A dashing young feminine once fainted in my arms; she 
wore a 
low-necked dress! and the sight I 
then beheld so un-
nerved me, that I 
have never recovered my proper firmness 
since, for— 
I 
am such a 
modest young man, etc. 
I 
would die at the sight of a 
bustle, 
TImugh to some it is exquisite bliss, 
It would weaken the strength of my muscle. 
Should a 
female attempt me to kiss! 
So girls, I 
now give you warning, 
Don't you think that I 
ever would wed, 
I 
should leave you alone before morning,* 
With the pillow to grasp in my stead. 
SPOERN.—I never could overcome the sensation! 
To be a 
married man would " use me up" completely! 
I'm too bash-
ful, you know—in fact— 
I'm such a 
modest young man, etc.

OUR BOARDING HOUSE. 
Written and sting by SAM. DEVERE. 
Copyright, 1877, by A. .J. Fisumt, 98 Nassau Street, N. Y, 
I 
LIVE in a 
bang-up boarding house, 
Not very far away. 
Make no mistakes we're a 
healthy gang, 
We have three squares a 
day. 
And when we get home late at night. 
We never miss a 
trick. 
We skirmish around for what is left. 
And make the pantry sick. 
Cuoims. 
Don't the boarders make a 
dash, 
Every one as quick as flash, 
When the big bell rings for hash, 
Lp at our boarding house. 
There's Alonzo Tape, a 
dry-goods clerk, 
Tobias, with the pigeon toes, 
Tabitha Knowall, a 
nice old- maid, 
With curls, and a 
long red nose. 
There's Mr. Fresh, he talks you to death, 
And Smith as quiet as a 
mouse. 
Our appetites are photographed, 
Up•at our boarding house. 
Don't the boarders, kc. 
There's a 
pale young man in the attic room. 
His hair hangs down in curls. 
He writes nice poetry on the walls, 
He's a 
tough man with the girls. 
Our boarding mistress, bless her heart. 
She says I 
can't be shook. 
I'm into her now for seven weeks board. 
And II make it red hot for the cook. 
Don't the boarders, &c.:

Don't think by my dress that I've come here to beg, 
Though the sharp pangs of hunger I 
feel, 
The cup of misfortune I've drained to the dregs, 
But I'm proud if I'm shabby genteel. 
A time was wnen swells who met me would say, 
Ah ! Harry, my boy, come and cline," 
But now when they meet me they look the other way, 
My company now they decline.

One evening last week a., 
e 
other end of town, 
Whilst wandering sadly along, 
I 
picked up a 
purse which a 
lady had dropped ; 
The temptation to keep it was strong, 
My pockets were empty, but firmly I 
said, 
She shall have her own, come what will. 
She looked at my dress as I 
gave it and said, 
If you're poor you're a 
gentleman still! 
Though poverty, Sz,c. 
Last evening I 
rescued a 
poor homeless girl 
Whom a 
swell was insulting; I 
found 
My strength for the moment, was something immense, 
As I 
hurled the great brute to the ground. 
He cried out, you beggar, don't meddle with me, 
Or you'll very soon get a 
pill. 
I 
said, lay a 
hand on that girl and you'll find 
If I'm poor I'm a

0; this is the age of invention, 
Strange wonders turn up ev'ry day, 
All the sciences seem in convention, 
Where they'll stop at, no mortal can say; 
But the latest and greatest of mysteries, 
Which at other wonders surpass, 
To go down in posterities' hist'ries. 
Are these wonderful panes of blue glass. 
CHORUS. 
'Tis a 
science none others compare to, 
The philosopher's stone found at last, 
For ' twill cure all the ills flesh is heir to, 
These wonderful panes of blue glass. 
If a 
pane of blue glasE: you put over 
The head of your mother-in-law, 
She'll be tame as a 
lamb 
spring clover, 
And she can't even wag her own jaw; 
Your own wife won't dare ask where you've been to, 
If a 
night at your club you should pass, 
if you have in your own bed- room windows, 
These wonderful panes of blue glass. 
'Tis a 
science, etc. 
'Twould do well in the windows of churches, 
It might keep the preachers from sin. 
And in street cars ' mould make the conductors, 
Account for each fare they take in; 
And if you had a 
brick in your hat, sir, 
For a 
sober man wanted to pass, 
'Twould be easy for you to do that, sir, 
In your hat put a 
pane of blue glass. 
'Tis a 
science, et.o. 
A 
blue goblet full of good whiskey, 
Would be most tce tempting to pass, 
And no temperance mat will get frisky, 
If he drinks his rum from 
blue glass; 
All the boarding-house keepers will have them, 
And the boarders will get fat quite fast, 
f 
hey can't tell the shirt buttons from grizzle, 
When the hash is served up in blue glass. 
'Tis a 
science, etc. 
If we send up a 
dozen of glaziers, 
To the Capitol with this blue glass, 
Congressmen would be honest as blazes, 
And the days of their stealing be past; 
If we had blue glass ballot boxes, 
We'd have fair elections at last, 
And a 
President upright and honest, 
If the White House was glazed with blue glass. 
'Tis a 
science, etc.

THE WATER MILL. 
A Poem recited by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
Listen to the water- mill, all the livelong day, 
How the creaking of the wheel wears the hours away; 
Languidly the water glides—ceaseless on and still— 
Never coming back again to that water-mill. 
And the proverb haunts my mind, as the spell is cast— 
The mill will never grind again with the water that has passed. 
Take the lesson to yourself, loving hearts and true, 
Golden years are passing by, youth is passing, too; 
Try to make the most of life, losc no honest way, 
All that you can call your own lies in this—to- day. 
Power, intellect and strength may not, cannot last, 
The mill will never grind again with the wz-
Iter that has passed. 
Oh, the wasted hours of life that have fleeted by, 
Oh, the good we might have done, lost without a 
sigh; 
Love that once we might have saved with but a 
single word, 
Thoughts conceived, but not expressed—perishing unheard. 
Take the lesson to your heart, take, oh! hold it fast, 
The mill will never 2,-rind again with the water that has passed.

CHATHAM STREET SQUARE, 
Written by NED HARRIGAN. 
I 
landed from Ireland quite rosy and fat, 
In the ship Robert Walker, wid Mary and Pat: 
From swate Castle Garden to Broadway 1 
wint. 
To see the great city, I 
hadn't a 
cint. 
hin I 
got to the park, share I 
saw a 
big light, 
'Twas the clock in the steeple that lighted the night • 
Whin I 
crossed over the street, oh, great trouble wws there, 
'Twas Jews sellin' coats down in Chatham Street Sq,..etre. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the great trouble, oh, the great trouble, 
The trouble of passin' down Chatham Strec. Square. 
There was Yankees an' Frinclunin, an' Prussians an' Dutch, 
Was axing one question, an' that was " how much ?" 
Money was wanted for jackets an' coats, 
That the Jews warranted was from skins of the goats; 
Such bundles of clothes ' twas a 
sight for to see, 
Whin convaniently some one caught hold of me; 
I 
turned an' I 
looked—I 
was met with a 
stare— 
'Divas a 
Jew sellin' clothes down ill Chatham Street Square. 
Oh, t1.4 great trouble, etc. 
I 
wint in the store as green as new grass. 
For ould Nebacodnezzer himself couldn't pass ; 
Nothin' would do me but try on a 
suit, 
Wid a 
pair of suspinders and collars to boot. 
Thin I 
axed the Hebrew if he gave any trust, 
At the same time I 
stretched, all' the coat gave a 
bust, 
Thin he wanted tin dollars at once foe the tare, 
Which created a 
ruction in Chatham Street Square. 
Oh, the great trouble, etc. 
They called me a 
Paddy, an' mauy hard names, 
They brought in a 
crowd for to spill out my brains; 
'Twas thin I 
got mad, an' I 
soon did begin 
To put heads on the blaggards just as they came in, 
Whin all of a 
sudden such a 
whelt did I 
meet, 
I 
wint over their heads clear into the street; 
Wid a 
new suit on my back, sure what did I 
care, 
There's where I 
got even on Chatham Street Square. 
Oh, the great trouble, etc.

Some folks will cry " Oh! shame, Mrs. Jones, you are to blame, 
I 
never should have thought it, ma'am, of you," 
While, if they'd look at home before abroad they'd roam, 
I'm positive they'd have enough to do. 
Mrs. Brown says it's a 
sin, that Airs. Smith drinks gin, 
And harbors " tally- men from day to day; 
While Mrs. Green was caught doing what she hadn't ought, 
When she in self defencs was heard to say— 
" 
They all do it, they all do it, 
They all do it, though ofttimes they rue it; 
Yet they all do it, they all do it, 
And so it will continue to the end of the world!" 
For hours three or four, lovers Ppooning at the door, 
On any moonlight evening may be seen; 
Though if they want a 
lark, they have it in the dark, 
And they " do it," though they say " they didn't mean," 
When creeping down the stairs, comes the old man unawares, 
And kissing catch the couple in the act; 
The mother, from above, says " Don't interfere, my love, 
You can't dispute this most important fact—" 
They all do it, etc. 
Old women do declare, girls should never dye their hair, 
And then again they say it's very wrong; 
Without the least restraint, their faces so to paint, 
And rob the easy chair for their chignon. 
Each girl a 
little puff, has inside a 
little muff, 
They are never seen without it, night or day; 
And her pretty nose she'll powder, if a 
moment is allowed her, 
When, if you laugh, she'll innocently say— 
They all do it, etc, 
But what does most impress, is the style in which they dress, 
It's enough to make you laugh when them you see; 
They've a 
hat upon their heads, large enough to make up beds, 
For pussy cats with kittens two or three. 
In their panniers, too, behind, if examined you would find, 
The most important papers of the day; 
The Chronicle and Chimes, the Telegraph and Times, 
Or anything that chance puts in their way. 
They all do it, etc. 
There's my neighbor, Dinah Down, brught two lovely boys to 
town, 
And her husband gets but one pound one per week; 
You often hear him say, " If things go on this way, 
We'll a 
lodging in the Union have to seek I 
For the doctor and the nurse, will drain my scanty purse, 
With many more expenses to defray;" 
Then he gets into a 
passion, when they tell him "it's the 
fashion," 
And they soothe him as they sing this truthful lay 
They all do it, etc.

The Increase of Thirst. 
I'VE been drinking of late, I've been drinking— 
And the fact I 
can scarcely deny— 
I've been drinking hot gin and rum-punches, 
But now I'm obliged to go dry! 
Cries the man at the bar: " You're a 
bummer, 
You're something I 
can't understand; 
You've worked like a 
man all the summer, 
And still you've no scrip in your hand. 
It is true you are cheeky and bold, sir, 
All the rum I 
have got you could hold, sir; 
You could drink a 
whole barrel, I'm told, sir— 
Can you wonder the reason you're dry? 
It is true what you say, Mr. Landlord, 
I 
ought to have scrip laid away— 
A 
great plenty to go on a 
bust, sir, 
And drunk cocktails all night and all day: 
But you are like a 
dog in the manger, 
You might treat me, would you but try, 
But to bummers you act like a 
stranger— 
Can you wonder the reason I'm dry? 
For my thirst you don't care a 
thing, sir, 
For the rich man you'll make a 
gin-sling, sir, 
While I 
for my beverage must sing, sir— 
Can you wonder that sometimes I'm dry? 
'Tis true what you gay, Mr, Landlord, 
Good liquor is hard to resist; 
Just look at that poor, drunken rounder— 
Few drinks, God knows, he has missed. 
Can you wonder at his weak constitutign, 
When he drinks every time that he's asked? 
!I 
:r• 
Soon he'll go to that great Institution, 
To the State Farm he'll stagger at last? 
'There's his poor wife at home, God defend her ! 
With children whose years are quite tender, 
All the bread that they get kind friends send her— 
Can you wonder they':" hungry and dry! 
Can you wonder I'm dry, can you wonder 
When there's so many like me on the beat, 
So many poor thirsty creatures, 
Who would much rather drink than to eat? 
There's a 
rounder in the corner sits grinning 
In the broad open light of the night— 
In my pockets I've not got a 
shilling, 
Or we'd both be exceedingly tight; 
lie smiles with contempt and derision, 
A 
hot whiskey punch meets his vision, 
But the price of good liquor has risen, 
And still we are forced to go dry. 
Just think while you're drinking your wine, sir, 
That I'm not too proud to drink rum; 
While the drinks that you take can't be counted, 
'Tis a 
godsend for me to get one! 
Go visit the places that I 
take in; 
Such sights you will never behold. 
When a 
man's broke, his friends all forsake him, 
Though his heart may be made of pure gold I 
While one drink would soon break asunder 
The thirst this poor sufferer is under: 
Hear me plead with a 
voice loud as thunder; • 
Oh 1 
why will you let me go dry ?

HE'S A 
CORPORAL. 
Womds and Music by ANDY COLLOM, and sung by 
Miss IDA COLLOM. 
Behold a 
girl who's fond of life, 
My age is twenty-one ; 
am always fond of strife, 
And love to hear the drums ; 
My Charlie he's a 
Corporal Boy, 
So graceful and so ; 
The girls all cry as he marches away, 
Oh ! don't he put on style ! 
CHORUS. 
He's a 
Corporal, now, you see— 
A 
Sargeant soon will be ; 
A 
warrior bola—that I 
am told— 
And awful fond of me ; 
In the ranks he marches fine, 
And always keeps in time ; 
Front face---keep your plac— 
And never get behind. 
But now he's going to go away, 
My heart is filled with pain, 
For fear he never will come back 
To see his love again ; 
For if he does, him and me 
Will married, quickly, be. 
more a 
soldgering he will go, 
But stay at home w;th me.

"NEVER GIVE IN." 
As Sung by THE BRAFIAWS. 
Now, if you will listen a 
moment or two, 
I'll sing you a 
bit of a 
rhyme, 
And tell you what I 
think a 
man must do, 
To make the best use of his time ; 
He must keep up his pluck, and must laugh at bad tuck, 
And be brave if he means to win ; 
His eye must be bright, and. his heart must be right, 
And his motto be, " Never give in." 
CHORES. 
Then keep yourselves steadily moving, lads, 
For laziness never can win ; 
Let hand and heart each play a 
part, 
And your motto be " Never give in." 
Since the days of my youth I 
have traveled a 
bit, 
And sojourned in many a 
clime; 
And I 
think of the truth I've unravelled a 
bit, 
Although I 
am still in my prime ; 
And this I 
have found, in my journeying round 
The world, from the East to the West, 
That he who has gone most steadily on, 
Is a 
happier man than the rest. 
Then keep, &-, c. 
I'll help a 
poor brother whenever I 
can, 
But a 
thing most offensive to me, 
Is to see a 
great lubbering lump of a 
man, 
With a 
heart of the size of a 
pea ; 
So as long as I 
live, this maxim I 
give 
To youngsters about to begin ; 
Don't falter or shirk, but stick to your work, 
Be patient, and " Never give in." 
Then keep, &c. 
Then forward! my lads, and you're sure to be right, 
Don't wait ' till your chances are gone ; 
'Tis better to struggle and fall in the fight, 
Than stand an look slothfully on; 
And when in your grave, ' twill be said you were brave, 
And men will be proud of your kin ; 
They'll say that you tried, and you manfully died 
In your harness, but " Never gave in." 
Then keep, &c.

Down by the Old Mill Stream. 
Sung with great applause at the Howard Athentettra, 
Boston, Mass., by Miss ELLA W FANBIt. 
You must know that my Uncle is a 
farmer, 
Keeps a 
large farm in the West; 
While staying there I 
met a 
little charmer, 
And many's a 
time I 
caressed 
That gi* so fair, with nut brown hair— 
Her equal ne'et was seen ; 
And where I 
met this charming little pet, 
Was down by the old mill stream. 
CHOR176. 
Down by the old mill stream, 
There man happy hours I've seen ; 
Strolling day by day, we passed the time away. 
Down by the old mill stream. 
Her father was the owner of a 
dairy, 
Her brother worked the plow; 
And while I 
used to roam with little Mary, 
Her mother would milk the cow; 
But her father said, " We should not wed," 
Which I 
thought rather mean ;

A.s she could not be my wife, she said " She'd end her 
By drowning in the old mill stream."

Saying, " I 
don't believe a 
word that you say," 
But when he saw her struggling in the water, 
He exclaimed, " Do save her, pray ?" 
But it was too late, she Lad met her fate; 
Oh! what a 
terrible scene ! 
The old-man cried, as the neighbors tried 
To pull her out of the stream. 
Dawn by, &o. 
At last they got her out of the water, 
And some of the neighbors said, 
"Oh! Brown, you've been the ruin of your daughter, 
For the girl is really dead !" 
He tore his hair, gave way to dispair, 
Rau away, never more was seen; 
And now I'm told the dairy is sold, 
That stood by the old mill stream. 
CHORUS. 
Down by the old mill stream, 
There many hours I've seen ; 
Strolling day by day, we passed the time away, 
Down by the old mill stream.

THE BEAUTIFUL SNOW, 
The author found at last—ADD RY.maN's MOTRER•IN-LAW, 
OH ! the snow, the beautiful snow, 
Filling the sky and the earth below; 
over the house-tops, over the streets, 
Over the heads of the people you meet, 
Dancing, flirting, skimming along. 
Beautiful snow, it can do nothing wrong, 
Flying to kiss a 
fair lady's cheek; 
Clinging to lips in a 
frolicsome freak, 
Beautiful snow from heaven above. 
Pure as an angel, gentle as love. 
Oh ! the snow, the beautiful snow, 
flow the flakes gather and laugh as they go, 
Whirling about in their maddening, fun, 
It plays in its glee with every one— 
Chasing, laughing, hurrying by. 
It lights on the face and it sparkles the eye, 
And the dogs with a 
bark and a 
bound, 
Snap at the crystals that eddy around; 
The town is alive and its heart in aglow, 
To welcome the coming of the beautiful snow. 
how wildly the crowd goes swaying along, 
Hailing each other with humor and song; 
How the gay sledges like meteors flash by, 
Bright for a 
moment, then lost to the eye ! 
Ringing, swinging, dashing they go. 
Over the crust of the beautiful snow— 
Snow so pure when it falls from the sky, 
As to make one regret to see it lie, 
To be trampled and tracked by the thousands of Net, 
Till it blends with the filth in the horrible street. 
Once 7 
was as pure as the sno 
but 
fell; 
Fell like the snow- flakes from :leaven to hell, 
Fel_ to be trampled as :n 
the street, 
Fell to be scoffed, to be spit on and beat, 
Pleadi..r..„.4 .cursing, dreading to dia. 
"Nr., 
48 
Seliing my soul to whoever would buy, 
Dealing in shame for a 
morsel of bread, 
Hating the living and fearing the dead, 
Merciful God ! have I 
fallen so low ? 
And yet I 
was once like the beautiful snow! 
Once I 
was as fair as the beautiful snow, 
With an eye like a 
crystal a 
heart like its glow; 
Once I 
was loved for my innocent grace— 
Flattered and sought for the charms of my face. 
Father, mother, sister, all. 
God and myself I 
have lost by my fall, 
Th veriest wretch that goes shivering by, 
Will make a 
wide sweep lest I 
wander too nigh; 
For all that is on or above me I 
know, 
There's nothing as pure as the beautiful snow. 
How strange it should b& that this beautiful snow, 
Should fall on a 
sinner with nowhere to go ; 
Hovs strange should it be'when night comes again. 
If the snow and the ice struck my desperate brain. 
Fainting, freezing, dying alone. 
Too weak for prayer, too weak for a 
moan, 
To be heard in the streets of the c.aty town; 
Gone mad in the joy of the sno w 
coming down; 
To be and to die in my terrible woe, 
With a 
bed and a 
shroud of the beautiful snow. 
Helpless and foul as the trampled snow, 
Sinner, despair not ; Christ stoopeth low 
To rescue the soul that is lost in its sin, 
And raise it to life and enjoyment again, 
Groaning. bleeding, dying for thee 
The Crucified Hung on the accursed tree, 
His accents or mercy fell soft on thine ear— 
ls there mercy for me ? will he heed my prayer? 
Oh God ! in the stream that for .
.?.inners did flow, 
Wash me, atul I 
shall be whiter than the beautiful snow.

OOME AND JOIN THE BAND. 
REVIVAL SONG. 
Words and Music by J, P. SKELLY. As sung by JoinWY 
ROACH, with great success. 
COME, come and be converted, 
Come from wickedness and sin, 
Let the devil be deserted, 
Come and join the band within; 
Hear us preach, and hear us pray, 
Join us in each happy lay, 
While you're loose and led astray, 
Come and join the band. 
CHORUS. 
Come, come, ev'ry Yankee, 
Ev'ry sinner thro' the laid, 
Pray with Moody, sing with Sankey, 
Come, and join the band! 
Now the glory flows around us, 
Angels blow their bugles loud, 
Sinners bless the day they found net, 
See them creeping through the croille-
46 
All the world we come to heal, 
Into every berast we steal, 
We are for the nation's weal, 
Come and join the band. 
Come, come, every Yankee, (to. 
We have crossed the mighty ocean, 
Now we're back with glory crowned. 
We have gained the world's devotion, 
Such a 
wicked lot we found, 
From the aged and the wise, 
Severed from their sinful ties, 
We have heard repenting cries, 
When they joined the band. 
Come, come, every Yankee, Ac. 
"SW 
I'D DO IT, OR KNOW THE REASON WHYir 
Written and sung by BILLY PASTOR. 
Air.-- it's Wonderfol How Ire, Do A" 
Now I 
hope I 
don't intrude, and you mustn't think me rude. 
If a 
question I 
should offer to suggest; 
Some philosopers do say " every dog will haw, 
his day," 
And they tell us everything is for the best. 
But as I 
look around, so many things I've foaral 
Which seem to me quite wrong and all awry; 
I've noted down a 
few, which 
nt,w recount to Nou, 
I'd correct them—or I'd know the reason why. 
The papers all do state that at Washington, of late, 
Dishonesty in office has been found; 
There's crooked Whiskey Rings, and a 
heap of othor things, 
Where bribery and thievery abound. 
If I 
was only President, I'd settle that machine. 
To rob our Uncle Sam they shouldn't try; 
For every office-holder should show a 
record clean, 
And they'd do it—or I'd know the reason why. 
In time not long gone by, we the world could defy, 
On the ocean, just a$ well as on the land, 
But no navy now we've got, and our vessels go to rot, 
Yes, our National shipbuilding's at a 
stand. 
If I 
but had my say, I 
would start at them straightway, 
Our mechanics, who for work do daily cry, 
And each for honest labor should have his honest pay, 
Well, I'd do it—or I'd know the reason why. 
There's Justice figured blind, the reason you will find— 
For the rich and poor a 
different law we've got; 
If a 
rich man runs away with his thousands, they will say 
He's absconded simply—but a 
thief he's not 
But let a 
poor man steal but the buying of a 
meal, 
He's arrested, and his case at once they'll try; 
Now if I 
was but the judge, even justice I 
would deal, 
Yes, I'd do it— or I'd know the reason why. 
Another 'Milan war we have got to settle for, 
With the hostile Sioux we've trouble got on hand ; 
It each manly heart alarms, for the Redskins are in arms, 
They've slaughtered gallant Custer and his band. 
The only way, no doubt, the red devils to wipe out, 
And safety for our settlers there to buy, 
Is to send a 
thousand riflemen, and every one a 
scout! 
And they'll do it—or they'll know the reason why.

GLITTER. 
As sang by Miss ELLA W ERNER. 
They're not all gems that glitter, no ! 
Attractive though they seem, 
For tinsel has a 
spurious glow, 
A 
Lright but transient gleam 7 
The thoughtless oft ars: caught by this, 
And most men may be sold ; 
Be careful that you don't get dross, 
Instead of shining gold. 
CUORGS, 
I. 
Glitter and glare may make people stare, 
But howe'er dazzling bright it may be. 
Glitter and gloss are nothing but dross ; 
Pure gold. pure gold, the metal for me. 
Be ye as ( haste, as pure as snow, 
You'll not escape the touch 
Of slander's tongue— be guarded- -and 
It v.-. 11 not harm you much. 
Be uprigh', just, and always fair, 
Each debt o:"iindneas pay ; 
Let deeds, not words, rof'.ect yelir. worth, 
And bear the light of day. 
Glitter and glare, ,Sze. 
Pure gold with some is very scarce, 
But wealth's a 
heeting joy ; 
The wealthy, like the poor, oft have 
Their share of life's alloy. 
Let each look round, and if he can, 
Extend a 
helping hand ; 
The peasant thus may vie the peer— 
The richest in the land. 
Glitter and glAre, tte.

STROLLING ON THE SANDS. 
As sung by EDDY Nosmoon. 
OF course we all know Ramsgate well, 
That spot to thousands dein, 
-Where dashing belles and heavy swelig, 
Assemble ey'ry year: 
Some like to roam along the Pier, 
And view what that commands, 
But my delight from morn till night, 
Is strolling on the sands. 
CHORUS. 
Strolling on the sands, strolling on the sands, 
Watching all the bathers dip, list'ning to the band, 
Strolling on the sands, strolling on the sands, 
In cool or heat there's nought to beat, a 
stroll upon the sands. 
I'll ne'er forget last summer-tInse, 
I 
spent a 
fortnight there, 
And made the sweet acquaintance of 
A 
lovely lady fair 
She'd gone to bathe at Dumpton Gap, 
But, oh! the naughty queen, 
For once she thought she'd do without 
That vile bathing machine. 
Stmlling, &C. 
She placed her clothes noon the beach. 
And then in the water played, 
But when she tried to come on shore, 
Ohl wasn't she dismayed; 
The tide had turn'd, and all her clothes 
Were floating out to sea, 
She'd nothing blither bathing dress— 
In what a 
plight to be. 
Strolling 
I 
fetch'd her mother to her aid, 
And saved all further strife, 
The maiden said, " this great event 
I'll think of all my ire." 
We soon became the best of friends 
For all enjoy'd the fun; 
We're lovers now—and soon Wt3 two 
Are going to be one. 
Strolling, Am.

Englishman, Scotchman, and Irishman. 
AS 
sung by Titomas W INNETT. 
An Englishman, Scotehman and inshman were sentenced to death 
for stealing sheep, and his Honor the Judge informed them he would 
he vei y 
lenient with them, and give them their choice of dying, that is 
they could die according to their own nationality. 
So the first to 
take the floor was the EtcomSnNtatc, who sang as bllows: 
Let me die on the oak. 
The brave old oak, 
That stands in the greenwood lawn, 
Let me die on the oak, 
The dear old oak. 
With its hundred of arms so strong, 
The next was the Scorca MAN who sang as 10(MS: 
The moon's on the lake. 
And the mist on the g 
en; 
And the glen that was known 
That is nameless by day, 
If their robbers by night, 
And pursue us with beagles, 
Give the flood to the rocks, 
And the flesh to the sea-gulls. 
Then hollo ! hollo ! Iloilo I 
Then hollo ! hollo 
While there's rope in old Scotland, 
And a 
tree by the river, 
It's there let me die Judge, 
And hang there forever. 
Third and last was the litisnmAN, who sang as follows: 
There's the Englishman and Scotchman 
As you plainly see, 
have their own way of dying 
And that you'll agree, 
But I 
would be hung to a 
gooseberry tree, 
Before the daylight in the morning. 
But a 
goosebery tree says the iudge is too low 
To hang a 
man on it and that you all know, 
Then Pat gave a wink to the Jury below, 
Saying, I'm in no hurry, 
Pith, I'll wait till she grows. 
(And the tree never grew.) 
OUR COUNTRY'S PAST, 
Written and sung by BILLY PASTOR. 
One evening I 
was sitting by my fire, after tea, 
And in the dying embers there strange sLlits I 
seemed to see. 
Our country's great and glorious past, with alnts famous 
names, 
Seemed blazoned there upon my sight, amid the dancing flames. 
And first I 
saw old Putnam, with his noble hero band, 
Upon the.heights of Bunker Hill they made their gallant stand; 
And for their country, for their homes, for Freedom struck a 
blow, 
That told the world that we'd be free—one hundred years ago. 
And next I 
saw George Washington, brave Lafayette and Lee, 
And Marion, who forsook their all that we might freemen be. 
And then I 
heard the crashing ice, felt the cold and piercing 
air 
Of that wintry night when Washington crossed o'er the Dela-
ware. 
I 
saw them next at Valley Forge, so wretched and so wan, 
But spite of hunger and of want they nobly struggled on, 
Until, at last, at Yorktown, they laid the British low, 
And America at last was free— one hundred years ago. 
But British hate once more attacked the freedom of our land, 
At New Orleans and Lundy's Lane they made a 
bloody stand 
But Winfield Scott and Jackson led us on to victory, 
And drove the baffled British back again into the sea. 
" 
Don't give up the ship, my boys!" I 
heard brave Lawrence 
cry, 
And on Lake Erie saw our flag in triumph floating high ; 
While the British ensign once again to our conquering arms. 
bent low, 
And America was free still as— one hundred years ago. 
59 
Then Texas threw her shackles off, and called on us for aid, 
Our gallant sons flew quick to arms, and Texas free was made; 
But dear the victory that we bought with the noblest blood on 
earth, 
And let all patriots drop a 
tear to the memory of Worth. 
Then once again the cloud of War rained death upon our land, 
But 1W70 Friends are opposed to Friends, men 'gainst their broth-
ers stand: 
And on our fair Columbia the hands of traitors struck a 
blow, 
To break the Union that we formed—one hundred years ago. 
I 
saw Anderson at Sumpter stand, Phil Sheridan's bold ride. 
And Farragut, ' midst the battle's roar, up at his masthead 
tied. 
I 
saw Sherman boldly marching from Atlanta to the sea. 
And.old Abe Lincoln tell the slaves that they at last were free. 
And then, at last, the North and South in unity did dwell, 
And both tt common brother mourned when gallant Custer fell. 
In every corner of our land is heard work's busy hum, 
And we shall still be freemen— for on:: hundred years to come !

randpa's chair is vacant, 
Near the fire in the grate; 
Where he told his tales of boyhood, 
Kept the little ones awake. 
One eve, so worn and weary, 
Sleeping on his knee they lay, 
Death called that night, like the Are bright, 
Grandpa passed away. 
Ctionus. 
So let the room be cheerful, 
Place the old arm chair 
Where we talked to Grandpa, 
With his silvery snow white hair. 
How he'd watch the falling ashes, 
And sadly meditate, 
Gently 4gh, we all must die, 
Like the fire in the grate. 
One bitter night in winter, 
The snow fell fast and wild; 
A 
girl looked in the window, 
A 
careworn, hapless child; 
Then Grandpa whispered " baby," 
And toddled to the gate, 
To save from sin, he brought her in, 
Near the fire in the grate. 
So let the room, 
Keep the fire burning, 
'Tis charity's bright flame; 
Reminding of the evening 
The orphan Mary came, 
So ragged, cold and hungry, 
With Grandpa from the gate; 
For him she kneels, a 
prayer she yields, 
Near the tire in the grate.

Where years ago we met,

Meet me once again; 
Old love is waking, 
Shall it wake in vain ? 
Love once again, 
Meet me once again! 
Old love is waking. 
Shall it wake in vain? 
I 
ever yet my thoughts incline, 
And back my memory slips; 
I 
feel warm fingers locked in mine, 
I 
see those quivering lips 
Whose murmurs came like music thro', 
When mine had set them free. 
That all the world was naught to you. 
Who only wanted me. 
Ah! Love, etc. 
So let the room, etc.

gissmpty Duniply.—The areatest Trick Book of the Age 
It pleases both old and young. 
It is the Pao- simile of a 
trick practised 
by all the Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and id 
accompanied with directions so plainly written that, with a single pa-
rusal, any person may become an adept in an unfailing source of 
amusement. Read what a 
leading Journal says of it: 
en ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order, has been sent us, 
called Humrry Dunarry,' and bound in such a 
way as to give opportu• 
nity for a 
decidedly puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary air 
pearance of a 
child's picture book, gaily printed and colored, it is sr, 
bound that a 
practised manipulator taking it up and flirting the leaved 
over, can make it appear to be filled only with one picture, or with blank 
pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of figures. 
One minute the 
pamphlet, quickly thumbed, appears to contain nothing but the portrail 
of Harlequin, in his tesselated suit ; the next only Columbine, then 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Biding Hood, or Mephistophiles. A little 
practice, and the directicias printed with the book will make anybody 
at home in the handling of it."— Phil. Eve. Bull
