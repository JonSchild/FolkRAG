broadcast. I sow, sow mine this way, you know. I sow one corner that way and I'll sow one this way.
And when I went plant the corn, I drop the corn right in there and took that cultivator and put right
on, you know. After them put right on with that cultivator, then I hauled the manure and broadcast
them in there. And then let out corn come up throughthat manure. You see? And as long as that corn

it. And that manure will stay on that corn roots there and we would see crops. But guano, I wouldn't
