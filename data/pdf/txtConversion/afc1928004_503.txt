The Lads from Lancashire. 
Words by PAUL H AMLIN. 
Music by GEO. CAREY. 
Sung by CAREY and 
H AMLIN with great success in all the principle theatres South. 
Here we are two jovial lads from merry England shore, 
We never shall forget the time we crossed the ocean o'er, 
And landed in America, the place to us so dear, 
To show the people one and all the dance of Lancashire. 
CHORUS. 
So watch us while we execute the•time and you will hear, 
The music in the dancing of the lads from Lancashire. 
We took to dancing when we were two little baby boys, 
And though the years have past and gone ' tis still our only joy, 
We are just as happy as can be as on through life we jog, 
One greatest feat in dancing is the jig the reel, and clog. 
So watch us, & c. 
So now we've done our, best to please we'll bid you all adieu, 
And hope we'll meet some future time our friendship to renew, 
We've showed you all those little steps to Englishmen so dear, 
$o now we'll do thc champion seven that's done in Lancashire. 
St) watch us, 84.c, 
Lancashire Song and Dance. 
Written by JAMES RICHMOND, for CAREY and H AMLIN. 
You may think our style is rather odd, 
For it seldom is seen here, 
Our idea is to show you all, 
The way they dance in Lancashire. 
We can dance all day and never tire, 
How the boys and girls would smile, 
To see us rattle our wooden shoes, 
In our own original style. 
CHORUS. 
We left Lancashire and came over here, 
The style that we mention we'll now show to you, 
With execution and ease it will ne'er fail to please. 
So pass your opinion when us lads are through. 
We learned to dance when we were young, 
We would practice all the day, 
To learn the taps of the toe and heel, 
Now to us it's only play. 
Our parents would chastise then, 
For wearing out the floor, 
But we would keep on dancing just as merry, 
Vntil our ankles would be sore. 
We left Lancashire, ‘.3c. 
Neat Irish Song and Dance. 
Written and composed by GEO. CAREY, and sung by CAREY and H AMLIN 
with great success. 
Not long ago we came across the sea, 
And came out here to sing and dance for ye, 
Shure I 
thought it would break my heart 
When my from friends I 
had to part, 
And sail across the ocean far away. 
When we started it was in the glorious spring, 
Shure I 
thought it was a 
very curious thing, 
For to see the water splash and the ship and dash, 
I 
thought I 
never would see home again. (Dance.) 
There is a 
girl of mine upon the other side, 
When I 
go back I'll make her my dear bride 
'Tis then I'll jump with glee, 
And at night we'll have a 
spree, 
And we'll sing and dance until we do get tired. 
If the first one should happen for to be a 
boy 
'Tis then I'll sing and dance with joy 
For as shure as dogs are dogs, 
I'll make him put on the clogs, 
And we'll do a 
double act both him and I. 
(Dance.) 
Written by GEO. CAREY, expressly for JOHNNIE RAY, 
My name is Isaac Levi, 
I 
am an Irishman, 
I 
came from Jerusalum, 
I 
was born in Japan, 
My sister is an Italian, 
From the country of Mayo, 
And when she's in a 
walking match 
You'll find she is never slow. 
CHORUS, 
I 
am the man with the terrible gall, 
And a 
bartender I'll brace for a 
ball, 
If he don't give it I'll think he is small, 
For I 
am the man with the terrible gall. 
My father came from Syracuse, 
It's a 
town in Tipperary, 
He's a 
Chinaman by birth, 
And his maiden name was Carey. 
My partner's folks are dead and gone, 
They are living in some city, 
So ladies and gentlemen 
On Hamlin you'll take pity. 
I 
am the man, 
The Hatters. 
Sung by CAREY and HamtArr. 
We are here to-night with spirits light, 
Of music we are fond, 
We left the old dart years ago, 
To come across the pond. 
O'Shaughnessy the hatters, 
And if you want a 
tile, 
Come down to our establishment, 
And we'll fit you out in style. 
CHORUS. 
We are Pat and Mike O'Shaughnessy the hatters, 
We are here at your command, 
And if you want a 
tile, 
Shure we'll fit you out in style, 
We are the greatest in the land. 
You've all heard tell of that wonderful dize, 
The hat my father wore, 
And how we scirmished all about, 
And never could find no more. 
It was made by the O'Shaughnessy Brothers, 
It was made as stiff a-
s. starch, 
It carried the day it marched away, 
On the 17th of March. 
We are Pat and Mike, &c.

Parody on the Old Arm Chair. 
Written by GEO. CAREY. 
Dedicated to Jtm NAREY, the Irish Bull Frog. 
Not many years ago in Ireland you must know. 
That a 
cousin of mine he turned up his toes, 
And a 
funny thing he said before he went to bed, 
That he would will to me all of his old clothes. 
Says one of his aunts I 
want his vest and pants, 
And his cats and dogs, besides his billy goat, 
Says I 
take all he is worth, but leave him his old shirt, 
And let me have his old hat and his old coat. 
CHORUS. 
How his sisters and his aunts, 
How they wrestled for to get his pants. 
His mother-in-law made a 
race for the goat, 
I 
never thought that I 
would get his hat or coat. 
With the fright my cousin died, his hat and coat was all his pride 
And that night before my bed-side there he stood, 
The coat and hat was on the bed, oh my God I 
was in dread 
That he'd lay his hands upon me and I'd choke. 
But he kept so awful still, that he drove me in a 
chill, 
Oh ! heavens, shure I 
thought that I 
would croak, 
But he looked me in the eyes and he grabbed the coat and dize, 
Shure he walked off with me darling hat and coat. 
How his sisters, &c.

The tallow dips in beauty, 
Shine bright upon the scene 
Of pleasant gay commotion, 
As grand as ever seen; 
A 
kitchen full of dancers, 
In a 
famous frisky rout, 
Who lift the very roof itself, 
With this mysterious shout. 
CHORUS— 
Rise it, Reilly! all the jolly dancers sing out, 
Rise it, Reilly! show your power and motion, 
Looney now they fly about, lazy feet had better g-'
out, 
'When in the chorus wild they shout: Rise it, Reilly! 
'Tis they who never weaken, 
They'd scorn to lave the flure, 
Their feet have vowed that never 
They'd make a 
record poor; 
The " Rocky Road " is startin', 
A 
tune they love so well, 
'Tis now the ruction boomin' grows, 
As wildly still they yell. 
Chorus. 
A few nate words of blarney, 
To some bright buxom lass, 
A 
few clean swigs of poteen, 
Widout the aid of glass, 
And soon the shrieks of music, 
Their notes a 
warning ring, 
When up and at once again, 
They dance and wildly sing. 
Chorus.

HARRY MINER'S SPECIALTY TROUPE, 
By James Richmond. 
Air—Wedding Day. 
The Pat Rooney Combination, 
No company could be finer, 
Headed by the king of Irish stars, 
And the popular manager, Harry Miner. 
Billy Carter and his banjo, 
And Morris and Fields make you laugh till you 
grow fat, 
And Wood and Beasley's pretty music you enjoy, 
also their funny chat. 
CHORUS-
For Rooney makes everybody laugh, 
North, South, East and West; 
He'll make you burst your buttons 
Off your coat, your pants, your vest. 
Reynolds and Walling, well, there is none better, 
They please without a 
simple break; 
And for society sketches you all know, 
Jeppe and Fanny Delano take the cake. 
must not forget Miss Georgie Kaine, 
Miss Josie Granger likewise. 
If I 
was a 
judge of serio-comics, 
I 
should surely give them the prize. 
So don't think me impertinent, 
Whate'er may be my lot. 
Well, good evening, Lamont and Ducrow, 
You're each a 
happy hottentot.

BOB SLAVIN'S REMARKS, 
Sung, wiLn great success, by Bob Slavin. 
There are a 
great many sayings I've heard in my time, 
;• 
And half I 
believe to be lies, 
While the rich man is feasting on peanuts each day, 
The poor man is starving on pies. 
It's a 
shame in the land the Italians call free, 
We can't get money our eyebrows to dye, 
The poor working girl wears her gall out for a 
million a 
week, 
And takes weekly baths in six cent rock and rye. 
CHORUS-
Then remember my sayings, when you are insane, 
Counting the dimes by the penny, 
Remember you have a 
moustache of your own, 
While the poor working girl hasn't any. 
My name is Hart the walker, 
I 
used to wear two-cent paper collars, 
But since I 
made 565 miles, 
I 
am worth fourteen thousand dollars. 
1 
don't mix up with colored trash, 
I 
make a 
living by my legs, 
I 
eat Charlotte Russe and stewed ice cream, 
Custard pie and scrambled eggs.

FOOLISH DITTY. 
Sung with great success by Bob Slaven 
We've a 
bird in the garden 
Called Nelly, Nelly, Nelly, 
And she is always a- sticking her nose 
In the jelly, jelly, jelly, jam. 
We've a 
cow in the parlor 
Called Robber, Robber, Robber, 
And all over the neighbors 
He does slobber, slobber, spit. 
We've a 
pig on the piano • 
Named Willie, Willie, 'Willie, 
And to judge by his actions, 
He is silly, silly, silly.

A 
Flower From My angel Mother's Grave. 
Words and music by H ARRY KENNEDY, ventriloquist. 
Music copyrighted 1878, by Wm. H. KENNEDY, 728 Duffield street, 
Brooklyn, N. Y. 
Sung with great success by the German emperor, Gus W ILLIAMS. 
I've a 
casket at home that is filled with precious gems; 
I 
have pictures of friends dear to me, 
And I've trinkets so rare, that came many years ago. 
From my far distant home across the sea. 
But there's one sweet little treasure that I'll ever dearly priie, 
Better far than all the wealth beneath the wave ; 
Tho' a 
small faded flow'ret, that I 
placed in childhood's days, 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
CHORUS. 
Treasured in my mem'ry like a 
happy dream, 
Are the loving words she gave, 
And my heart fondly cleaves to the dry and withered leaves— 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
In the quiet country churchyard they laid her down to sleep; 
Close beside the old home she's at rest, 
And the low, sacred mound is enshrined within my heart, 
By the sweet ties of love forever blest. 
In the still and silent night I 
often dream of home again, 
And the visions ever tells me to be brave ; 
For the last link that binds me to the place I 
love so well, 
Is the flower from my angel mother's grave. 
Treasured in my mem'ry, &c. 
Sung with great success by EDWIN BARRY at the Theatre Comique, 
I 
loved a 
girl named Polly, and thought that she loved nw, 
So joined a 
ship to take a 
trip across the briny sea, 
And when the morning had arrived for me to sail away, 
I 
gave the lass a 
parting kiss, and then to her did say: 
CHORUS. 
Good bye Polly, I 
must leave you, 
Let us hope the parting will not grieve you, 
The ship it sails to-day, some thousand miles away; 
So think of me when I 
am on the sea. 
She vowed that she'd be true to me while I 
was away, 
And thinking what she said was right, I 
left her my half pay ; 
Then with a 
sigh bid her good-bye, and as they heaved the lead, 
I 
left her standing on the shore, then jumped aboard and said: 
Good bye, Polly, & c. 
I 
saw her in my dreams at night, I 
thought of her all day, 
Ilut did not think that she was false to me, when far away ; 
For I 
must own when I 
alone, was lying on my bed, 
I 
often woke up in a 
fright, and these words have said: 
Good bye, Polly, & c. 
Some years had passed when I 
returned, with lots of gold 
in store, 
And lust you fancy my surprise, when I 
knocked at the door. 
They told me Poll was married, she had been false to me, 
So now no more I'll stay on shore, I'm off again to sea. 
Good bye, Polly, &c. 
Written by Mr. W. J. Scanlan, and sung by him in Minnie Palmer's 
" 
Boarding School," at the San Francisco Minstrels' Opera House. 
Why do I 
smile ? well, I 
will tell, 
My heart is filled with joy, 
I'm a 
dandy copper on the Broadway Squad, 
And a 
brave one at that am I. 
If there's a 
murder or fight about, 
You'll always find me near, 
And as I 
pass the ladies say, 
Ah! isn't he a 
dear. 
CHORUS— 
I'm a 
darling, ain't I 
charming, 
And the ladies all say as I 
pass them by, 
Ain't he purty! ain't he lovely! 
Dan McCormack the copper am I. 
I 
visit all the collar shops, 
About three times a 
week, 
In one of them my sweetheart works, 
And of love I 
always speak. 
I 
acquaint her with all the acknowledgments, 
Which from the public I 
receive, 
And tell her how they'll sigh and sob, 
When the force I'd have to lave. 
I'm a 
darling, etc. 
My antecedents were high-toned, 
Respected everywhere ; 
My father could whip an elephant— 
My mother could whip a 
bear. 
My sister could toss a 
camel, 
My brother could fight a 
fly, 
They could stand a 
rhinoceros on his head, 
And sing the Swate By-and-By. 
I'm a 
darling, etc.

Little Cherry Blossom. 
BE AUTIFUL SONGS UNSUNG, 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Written, composed and sung by BOBBY N EWCOMBE. 
Published and copyrighted 1878 by E. H. H ARDING, 229 Bowery. 
Price 40 cents. 
Published by permission. 
Dedicated to H ARRY M INER, New York. 
The red, red rose that lovely grows, 
And blushes like a 
maiden, 
Keeps nodding to the gentle breeze, 
With rosy perfume laden ; 
To greet a 
little tiny elf, 
For her my heart is yearning; 
And lately I 
am scarce myself, 
My heart with love is blooming. 
CHORUS. 
Little Cherry Blossom, will you love me ? 
Little Cherry Blossom, will you wed me? 
While the stars are twinkling in the silent dell 
Such a 
tale of love I'll tell thee ! ( Repeat.) 
The lily all proclaim so fair, 
She is the queen of flowers; 
The rose, they say, conveys true love, 
'Mid Cupid's shining bowers; 
The Pansie says, " forget me not !" 
The Laurel crowns with glory, 
The one that's fairer than the lot, 
The subject of my story. 
Little Cherry Blossom, &c. 
The dew upon the rose is like 
The tears that she is shedding, 
Impatient for a 
day to come, 
For soon there'll be a 
wedding ; 
And from life's garden I 
shall cull 
A 
fair and fragrant flower, 
And keep it blooming all my life, 
Within love's happy bower. 
Little Cherry Blossom, &c. 
Sung by Miss Georgie Melnotte.

There are songs unsung in ey'ry heart, 
Some beautiful memory hidden, 
That nestles alone in its resting place, 
By sorrow and tear-drops hidden, 
Some sad, sad hope that once did bloom, 
When life was gay and young, 
But now it is faded, and withered, and dead. 
Oh ! beautiful songs unsung. 
CHORUS— 
Beautiful songs unsung, 
Sorrowful songs unsung, 
Oh ! nestle alone in thy secret place, 
Oh ! sorrowful songs unsung. 
There are songs unsung, there are tales untold, 
Whose memory never can perish, 
For the hearts that know them are hearts of gold, 
And they keep them to love and to cherish. 
Tho' some are sombre and sad and drear, 
To the lives of the saddened they're clung, 
They are set in tears and never can die, 
oh! sorrowful songs unsung, 
Beautiful songs unsung, &c. 
There are songs unsung, there are words of love. 
That in kindness and truth were spoken, 
But now are the links of a 
glad, wild dream, 
Cherished and loved, yet broken. 
And, oh! to the heart that knows them so well, 
They've the sweetest of thoughts among, 
For they seem like a 
life that was kissed by death, 
Oh ! sorrowful sungs unsung. 
Beautiful songs unsung, & e.

HARDING'S, 229 Bowery and

Now list ye to my classic lay, 
Politely hearken loudly, while 
I 
sing of Levi Kassiday, 
A 
blazing star of solid style ; 
From Coney Isle to Zululand, 
From sweet Cohohohoes to Newfoundlana, 
Roam where you will a 
man you'll never find 
Like Levi Kassiday. 
CHORUS. 
For he's a 
man, understan, wid a 
very fine eye for a 
nice 
young girl, 
And a 
primo judge of Dublin wine, 
And creamy cream of the style, do you mind, 
Wid a 
rose like his nose, 
Of a 
color as bright as the red blue say, 
Oh, it's on the street, there's few you'll meet 
Like Levi Kassiday. 
A.- down the street with stately tread, 
And style that dislocates them all, 
Meanders he, enveloped in 
A 
brand new fresh spring suit of gaul; 
Upon his arm hangs Julia Ann, 
Sweet lady bird of this daisy man, 
A. Don Juhannes in his mind is he, 
This Levi Kassiday. 
(Chorus.) 
When voices sweet were handed round, 
Levi was not behind the door, 
An over strung bass voice has he, 
He sang the " mast " in " Pinafore" 
From Asiah to Kalamazu, 
From Canadaw to San Franciscu, 
Another one of it :‘ ou'll seldom meet 
Like Levi Kassda , ( Chorus.)

My grandmother she at the age of eighty-
three, 
One day in May was taken ill and died, 
And after she was dead, the will of course was read, 
By a 
lawyer as we all stood by his side, 
To my brother, it was found, she had left a 
hundred pounds, 
The same unto rny sister I 
do declare, 
But when it came to me, the lawyer said I 
see, 
She has left to you her " Old arm- chair." 
CHORUS. 
And how they titter'd, how they chaff'd, 
How my brother and sister laugh'd, 
When they heard the lawyer declare 
Granny had only left to me her old arm chair. 
I 
thought it hardly fair, still I 
said I 
did not care, 
And in the ev'ning took the chair away, 
The neighbors they me chafid, my brother at me laugh'd 
And said it would be useful John, some day. 
When you settle down in life find some girl to be your wife, 
You'll find it very handy, I 
declare. 
On a 
cold and frosty night when the fire is burning bright, 
You can then sit in your old arm chair. 
.And how they titter'd, &c. 
What my brother said came true for in a 
year or two, 
Strange to say I 
settled down in married life, 
I 
first the girl did court, and then the ring I 
bought, 
Took her to church and when she was my wife, 
The old girl and me, were as happy as could be, 
For when my work was over I 
declare, 
I 
ne'er abroad would roam but each night would stay at home 
And be seated in my old arm chair. 
And how they titter'd, &c. 
One night the chair fell down, when I 
pick'd it up I 
found, 
The seat had fallen out upon the floor. 
And there to my surprise, I 
saw before my eyes, 
A lot of notes, two thousand pounds or more, 
When my brother heard of this, the fellow I 
confess, 
Went nearly mad with rage and tore his hair, 
But I 
only laugh'd at him, and said unto him, Jem, 
Don't you wish you had the old arm chair? 
And how they titter'd, &e.

Sons of Erin's Isle. 
Title and music composed by PADDY M URPHY. 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 1879. 
We've heard marshal songs and songs of the sea; 
Love songs and comic songs, but they don't suit me. 
We love to sing of Ireland—sweet land of our birth— 
I'm Paddy, her son, and she's my mother earth. 
Oh Erin, my country it grieves us to see 
Our enemies prosper. and yet we are not free. 
We fight for other countries as through life we roam, 
When half of our fighting would free our old home. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah for the sons of Erin's Isle! 
Hurrah for the daughters, who on us do smile! 
A 
fig for her foes, where-ever they may be ; 
Three cheers for old Ireland and sweet liberty. 
Then arise, sons of Erin, and prove to the world 
The sunburst of freedom is once more unfurled. 
Be united like brothers, and join hand in hand, 
Then you'll drive the proud Saxon from off of our land. 
Sure the land is the people's, and who dare to dispute 
The word of our maker—for he spoke the truth. 
Then desend from the hill, and arise from the glen, 
.And once more the battle of freedom begin. 
Then hurrah, 8ce. 
MURPHY, ANCHOR YER FEET, 
-
,V-
fitlen by Edwin Talbot, and sung by Murphy & Mack. 
An Irishman, as you can see, 
I'm known both far and wide. 
Since I've been in this country 
I 
have been the people's pride, 
When first I 
landed in New York 
It filled me with conceit, 
The kids say, 
Murph, for digging turf, 
You have the real elegant feet. 
CHORUS— 
For the other day I 
heard them say 
That me nose looked like a 
beet, 
Then all the gang with vulgar slang. 
Roared, Murphy, anchor yer feet. 
My Delia Clancy, that's the girl I 
love, 
Sure I 
called on her the other night, 
And swore by all the clouds above. 
For there was none out that night, 
Says I, " My darling charming Delia, 
My heart is yours complete." 
Says she, - I 
won't have any funny business, 
Oh, Murphy, anchor yer feet." 
Sure it's President they say I'd be, 
If it wasn't for this hullabaloo. 
If my head was only the size of my feet, 
And of course that's very true. 
You might know I'm a 
prominent man, 
For every one I 
meet as I 
stroll along, 
You'll hear the gang shout, " Holloa, 
Murphy, anchor yer feet."

Price 40 cents. 
There's a 
girl of high degree upon whom I 
am awfully stuck, 
She dances in the ballet, while her father drives a 
truck ; 
Her mother she peddles lemonade, her brother he slings hash, 
Yet the neighbors say most every day, Johanna's on the mash. 
CHORUS. 
Johanna Louisa McGuire 
Is a 
girl that you all could a.dmire 
She's a 
voice like a 
bell, 
Though I 
never could tell 
Where she got it or how, 
Yet you all do allow 
That Johanna Louisa McGuire 
Has something that you all would desire, 
For she's awfully gay on St. Patrick's day, 
Is Johanna Louisa McGuire. 
She inhabits a 
little sky parlor up an alley where everything's 
snug, 
Her furniture's very antique, a 
table, three chairs and a 
jug. 
I 
one evening at the window sat as her invited guest, 
From the alley below some young devil did throw a cud of 
, 
Jackson's best. 
SPOKEN.— It 
struck the girl bang in the eye, the old yellow 
jack molasses tobacco. 
I 
was about to sympathize with her, 
when one of those young devils yelled— 
Johanna Louisa McGuire, &c.

Kiss Me Good. Bye, Darling. 
As sung by .Totor O. LLACH, in San Francisco, Cal 
Gently the moon mounts the sky, 
Stars their nightwatch do keep, 
And why let those tears dim thine eye? 
Thine were not made, love, to weep. 
Look up and tell me you love me, 
Grief nearly breaks my poor heart, 
Smile once again in mine eye, 
Then kiss me, kis me, ere we part. 
CHORUS. 
Good bye, darling, goodbye, 
Do not grieve or miss me, 
I 
must go; I 
leave you weeping, 
So good by darling, kiss me. 
Farewell my loved one, my own, 
Oh, but be true unto me, 
Soon will my life bark be thrown 
Out on the tempest at sea. 
I'm going, my darling, I 
love thee, 
Lips speak the love of the heart, 
Smile once again ere I 
go, 
Then kiss me, kiss me, ere we part, 
(Chorus.)

Miss Nancy I

Pretty little Nancy will you love me? 
For you know I 
love you, Nancy Green, 
I 
will love you in the morning and the evening, 
If you will only wed me, Nancy Green. 
'Twas in among the sweet grape vine 
Where first I 
met Miss Nance, 
The little birds sang sweetly, 
My heart was in a 
trance.

asked her for to marry me, 
She did not answer no, 
And on next Sunday afternoon 
We both to the church will go.

for me, 
And so around we balance, and each daisy is crazy 
Wid great hilarity, all at the Twilight Coterie.

Fare thee well, for once I 
loved you, 
Even more than tongue can tell,

You are false but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may.

heart-ache as the moments come and go. 
Your love I 
know is truthful, but the truest love grows cold I

Down the stream of time together we are sailing side by side,

It is only this, my darling, that you'll love me when I'm

Why Did. My Josie Go ? 
Written by Wm. J. SCANLON, of SCANLON & CRONTN. 
I 
went up to Barnum's a 
short time ago, 
The circus of course there to see, 
The evening being fine and to spend a 
nice time, 
I 
brought my dear Josie with me. 
She seemed so delighted it made me feel good, 
My heart with joy it did beat, 
And when it was over we started to go 
From the circus out into the street. 
Cnoitus. 
Oh, my I 
wasn't it fine, 
Oh, how the riders did shine, 
The clown he was laughing, talking and chaffing, 
My little Josie she laughed all the time. 
Last night when we reached my dear Josie's home, 
She said, now don't think me a 
bore 
If I 
ask you to call here again to-morrow night, 
To the circus we'll go just once more. 
My answer was yes, of course, my dear Joe, 
What e'er your request it may be; 
I'll grant it, my love, if it lies in my power, 
For my love it is always with thee. 
Next evening again to the circus we went, 
My Josie she looked like a 
queen, 
When the riders came out they all looked at her, 
She very much embarassed did seem, 
But, alasl she cried out to the man in the ring, 
My darling, I'm waiting for thee, 
She jumped from my side to my great surprise, 
And every one there laughed at me. 
(Chorus.) 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my! why did she go ? 
Oh, why did she treat me so, 
She was my darling, always so charming, 
None in this iworld like my own little Joe.

Performed In his 
" 
Mystic Changes." 
Good evening to you all, 
I 
hope I 
don't intrude, 
Dress in this fashion, 
Pray don't think me rude; 
I'm leader of the style, 
That's plain enough to see, 
So if you want the fashion, 
Get pinned back just like Inc. 
CHORUS. 
All pinned back 
all pinned back! 
It's the style, you see; 
All pinned back I 
all pinned back! 
That's the style for me. 
Some people don't like it, 
And say you cannot walk, 
While dressed in a 
pinned-back, 
But that is foolish talk; 
They are only jealous, 
And to that you agree, 
So if you like the fashion, 
Get pinned back just like me. 
All pinned back, etc.

Tell Me Love, Will You Remember? 
Duet sung with great success by the WnrrNEY's, in their original 
sketch, " Rehearsal in the Parlor." 
Tell me love, will you remember 
When I'm far away from thee ? 
Will you still be true my darling, 
When I'm sailing o'er the sea, 
keep the vows of love we plighted 
When we bade our last farewell, 
That you'll keep me in remembrance, 
Tell me, darling, only tell ? 
CHORUS. 
Whisper softly, sweetly, darling, 
Say I 
will be true to thee, 
Though for years we may be parted, 
Promise to remember me. 
Tell me love, will you remember 
'When the roses cease to bloom? 
And December, bleak and dreary, 
Takes the place of gentle June. 
Though we may be parted, darling, 
By the cruel hand of time, 
Promise that you will be true, love, 
'Till I 
come to call you mine.

PADDY'S LANDS 
Composed by JOHNNY ROAM. 
COME all ye boys from Paddy's land, who are inclined to roam, 
To reap the English harvest so far away from home, . 
Be sure you're well provided with comrades bold and true, 
'or you have to fight both day and night 'gaiust John Bull and 
his crew. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah, my boys for Paddy's land, 
'Tis the land I 
do adore, 
May heaven smile on every child 
That loves that shamrock shore. 
When we left home for Dublin, the morning it being clear, 
And when we got on board the boat, we gave three hearty cheers, 
Saying: Good-bye, my boys, to that dear old land, we ne'ev 
may see it more, 
For we're going to light both day and night, all for that sham. 
rock shore. 
Then hurrah, S:c. 
We sailed away from Dublin quay, and ne'er received a 
shock, 
Until we landed in New York, long side of the dock, 
Where thousands of our countrymen that were all in that town 
And " Fagh a 
ballagh, clear the track 1" were the words that 
passed all round. 
Then hurrah, .S:c. 
Then away we went in merriment to drink bourbon and wine, 
Each lad he gave his favorite toast for the girl he left, behind; 
We sat and sang, made the ale-house ring, despising Erin's foes, 
Or any man that hates the land, where St. Patrick's shamrock 
grows. 
Then hurrah, & c.

As happy as a

Such a

A 
charming little maiden, and her name is Belle, 
She's just as sweet as honey, and she writes to me— 
You see that we are parted, she is far across the sea. 
If you've ever been in love, of course you'll understand 
The feelings of my heart, when loving letters reach your hand, 
How you'll stand and wonder what your sweetheart she has said, 
As I 
did, with the one that I 
have read. 
For on a

Of course I'm going to answer in a 
true love strain, 
And ask my little darling to return again, 
And soon a

Will bring me such a

Then when we are married, I 
will wrii:e you all the news, 
Tell you how we get along, and never have the blues, 
What a

got from o'er the sea, 
Our letters then will spell L-0-V- E.

THE IRISH BOY'S LAMENT. 
Written and sung by JOHNNY ROACH, the successful Irish Vocalist. 
FAREWELL, Ireltual, I 
can no longer dwell at home; I 
must 
cross the stormy main, 
Where crut 1 
strife may end my life, to see you ne'er again, 
It will break my heart from you to part, astore acushala machree. 
But I 
must go full of grief and woe, to the shores of America. 
CHORUS. 
So now farewell, f 
can no longer dwell 
Al home, acushala machree, 
But I 
must go, full of grief and woe, 
To the shores of America. 
On the Irish soil my fathers lived since the days of Erin Banoo, 
They paid their rent and lived content, convenient to Killdei,v, 
But a 
landlord cruel gave us the shuel, my poor old mother and 
me, 
We had to leave our home, far away to roam, and come to 
America. 
So now, &c. 
No more in the old churchyard, astore, on my father's grave 
shall I 
kneel, 
But the tyrant knows, but little of the woes, that a 
poor boy 
has to feel;

When I 
look around, on that little spot of ground, where the 
cabin used to be, 
I 
could curse the laws, that gave me cause to come to America. 
So now, ikc. 
Oh, where are the neighbors, kind and true, that was once our 
country's pride, 
No more they are seen, at the fair on the green, or the dance 
by the green hill side. 
'Tis a 
stranger's cow, that is grazing now, where the cabin 
used to be 
With notice they were served to be turned out and starved, or 
come to America. 
So now, &c. 
Oh, Erin Machree, must your children be exiled all over the 
earth, 
Must they think no more of you, astore, of the land that gave 
them birth, 
Must the Irish yield, like the beasts of the field; no, no, acush-
ala machree, 
They are going away in ships, with vengeance on their lips, to 
return to America.

My grandfather Ben had an old Shanghai hen 
Who laid eggs the size of a 
keg; 
She stood six feet high, from her foot to her thigh, 
And she measured one yard around the leg. 
She had an old rooster, her company for to keep, 
But at last he was killed and served fried, 
And she stopped, short, never to lay again, 
When the Shanghai Rooster died. 
CHORUS. 
00' 
No more fresh eggs in the morning, chick, chick, chick, ctnek. 
The breakfast table adorning, chick, chick, chick, chick ; 
But stopped, short, never to lay again, 
When the Shanghai Rooster died. 
In roaming around the farm the old hen took delight. 
And when evening's shades began to fall 
She'd hop up on the roof with the rest of the gang, 
Or stay out with her shanghai on the wall. 
But when daylight did appear, to the corn patch they 
would steer, 
And they would gobble up worms side by side: 
But she stopped, short. never to gobble again, 
When the Shanghai Rooster died 
No more fresh eggs, &c.

In a 
cosy cottage painted green, 
About three miles from here, 
There lives a 
pretty Irish queen, 
To me she does prove dear. 
Her mother takes in washing, 
And the girl helps at the trade, 
And when I've called upon her 
These words I've often said: 
CHORUS. 
Mary Ann McLaughlin, don't you cry, 
Take that apron from your eye ; 
Don't you let the neighbors hear you sigh, 
And we'll be married by-and-by. 
Now soon I'm going to married be, 
Of course I'll settle down ; 
I'll buy a 
house, also a 
farm, 
A 
short way out of town. 
Oh, then it will be joyful, 
When as cosy as a 
mouse; 
To see the young O'Malleys 
Play tag around the house.

In Scotland, France and Germany, 
Music you will hear, 
The Italian loves to play the harp, 
lie plays so soft and clear. 
Nveet music always charms my car, 
Wherever it may be, 
I 
love to hear Toni Moore's sweet songs, 
They have such harmony.

I 
love music, I 
love singing, 
I

The Irish songs are soft and sweet, 
They harmonize so well, 
The Meeting of the Waters, 
Or the Emigrant's Fareweh. 
There's Bobby Burns, the great Scotch poet, 
Whose memory shall reign 
In Scotland where he lived and died, 
And honored was his name.

In speaking of our poets great, 
There's one now whom I'll name, 
His praise is sung both far and near, 
He's well known for his fame. 
'Tis of William Cullen Bryant I 
speak, 
Who Americans will adore, 
His works are read throughout this world, 
From this to foreign shore.

Flow to Catch a 
Flea. 
As described by D AN COLLYER. 
Don't be in a

Watch your chances. 
Take a 
two-foot rule and measure the distance from your 
hand to the flea. 
Take your pencil and calculate the time it 
will take to pass your hand that distance, so you may be sure. 
Take a 
long breath. 
Aim to grab his hind leg. 
Nerve your-
self up, take a 
drink, make a 
ferocious grab, and if the flea 
strays off, continue the chase around the room until you 
tumble over the baby; then flee.

AT 
the theatre, one night, John Phcenix thought he saw an 
acquaintance sitting a 
few feet in front, and asked the gentle-
man between them to poke him with his cane. 
When he 
turned around John discovered his mistake. 
Fixing his at-
tention on the play, and affecting indifference of the whole 
affair, he left the man with the cane to settle tho disturbance, 
and he, being wholly without an excuse, there was, of course, 
a ludicrous and embarrassing scene, during all of which 
Plicenix was profoundly interested in the play. 
At last the 
man asked, indignantly : " Did you tell me to poke that man 
with my stick ?" " Yes." "And what did you want ?" " I 
wanted to see whether you would poke him or not." 
" 
YOU LIE !" 
The tone was deep and sincere, 
Yet scarce had the words been spoken 
Ere a 
bludgeon and cranium met and embraced, 
And the Sixth Commandment is broken.

Ev'ry loving deed and action

We are very soon forgotten

Oh, how soon we are forgotten

Though we aid our lame companions, 
Who are plunged in deepest strife.

To a

IT'S many years ago in Ireland, you must know, 
Since happiness looked down on our land, 
Our sons they then were free and the star of liberty, 
Shone gloriously on every Irishman. 
But let us bar the door on the:days that are nO more, 
There's a

If you liste, unto me I

CHORUS. 
Hurrah for Erin's Isle, though her sons you can beguile, 
Because they know the wolf is at the door, 
Yet may our flag be seen aloft in College Green, 
And a 
Home Rule in Ireland evermore. 
In England they may boast that our Parliament is lost, 
And say that we never should complain; 
Would you have my heart be light when I 
know for this veei 
right, 
My countrymen are wishing o'er the main. 
Gladstone he may rave but our country for to save, 
These words they should be heard from shore to shore.

Nor drive them to a

And a

would like the attention of the ladies all, 
And when I 
am through you will see. 
If the boys do not like it I 
don't care a 
cent, 
"k 
But ladies with me you'll agree, 
Should a 
man accost you while meandering the street, 
Don't laugh or giggle for shame; 
Don't notice such men, but pass on your way, 
If you don't you will be much to blame. 
CHORUS. 
For a 
man will invariably pass a 
remark 
On a 
lady passing him on the walk; 
Now just move along, no encouragement give, 
Then about you they never can talk. 
Go into a 
ball room, be happy and gay 
With a 
handsome young man by your side, 
There he tells you he loves you, and at some future day 
He would be happy to make you his bride. 
But if he should pinch you or hug you a 
bit, 
Give him to understand there and then, 
And just tell him plainly he had better behave, 
As you never encourage such men. 
For a 
man will, &c. 
Now 
if you have a 
sweetheart, and by chance he gets broke, 
He will not hesitate to tell you, 
Then he will say to you, " Darling, 
Will you be so good as to lend me a 
dollar or two ?" 
If you lend him a 
cent now to- day, just see 
If to-morrow he will not want ten. 
So hold fast to your money, and don't be a 
fool, 
For you can spend it on all just such men. 
For a 
man will, &c.

American Fortune-Telling Cards.-This is 
eat and 
and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We have 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arranged and printed in series-Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades-and each of these into K for King, Q 
for Queen, 
asd K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to direction. 
Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

Courting Cards.- This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people-a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a 
way as to be non-committal 
Many young ladies are visited by 
ntlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as th ei
r 
own, 
unl
ess i
t 
accords 
with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
farther explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
