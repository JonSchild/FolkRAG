Mrs. Sidney Robertson2850 - 19th AvenueSan Francisco, CaliforniaDear Mrs. Robertson: With the
approval of the Librarian of Congress, I am writing to tell you of our willingness to act as co-sponsor
of your project to record traditional music in California. In this connection we should agree to the
following:1. To guide the workers in indexing any material which they may accumulate. 2. To supply
200 acetate discs to be used in recording folk-songs. The finished records will become the property
of the Library. (Should additional discs be required, they will have to be applied for separately) 3. To
make these records available for duplication.4. To supply blank catalog cards for indexes which then
completed, will revert to the Library.
I should like to amplify the third point to the extent of saying that the Library cannot engage in any
record "publication" projects. Duplication of records will parallel the procedure now used in making
photostats. These are made on Library machines and by commercial firms at standard prices.Very
sincerely yours,Acting-Chief,Division of MusicHS/me

Dr. George HerzogColumbia UniversityNew York CityDear Dr. Herzog:A recent letter from Herbert
Halpert suggests you might be willing to act as one of the sponsors of the folksong collecting project
I am endeavoring to organize here. It would be invaluable if you were to feel like doing this. Would
you send a letter to this effect addressed to Dr. James B. Sharp, Coordinator, Statistical, Survey and
Research Projects, Works Progress Administration, 49 Fourth Street, San Francisco, Calif.? It would
help materially in getting the project under way.Albert Elkus ha offered some guidance, and my
project proposal includes an outline of the steps used in your melodic classification investigations,
with the idea that we will be able to cooperate with you in furthering this work. I hope to find funds
to enable the Music Department of the University of California to act as chief sponsor and keep a
set of the records made for research here; but so far I have not been successful in this.You will be
glad to hear that Elizabeth Ryan's eligibility for WPA has been finally arranged, and she is about to be
assigned to a Forestry Dept. project pending approval of this folksong project. For a while it seemed
AFCCC-COR3-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-2
doubtful that she could establish residence here properly. I'm looking forward to working with her.
I'm sure it can be arranged for her to finish her cowboy songs bibliography.Cordially yours,(Mrs.)

Dr. Albert ElkusDepartment of MusicUniversity of CaliforniaBerkeley, CaliforniaDear Dr. Elkus:
[Illegible page?]At our last conversation you will recall telling me that so far all that the Music
Department could provide as its sponsor's contribution to the folk music collecting project
was guidance and its coridal interest. I went to see Dr. Kroeber, as you suggested, but had just
left for Chicago, to be gone all summer.Since that conversation there have been the following
developments: 1) The Library of Congress has formally undertaken to act as co-sponsor and will
privde blank cards for indexing of disks and published collections of folk songs, plus a minimum of
200 acetate blanks, cards and records to revert to the Archives of American Folk Song at the Library.
2) An anonymous donor has given me $100 toward the establishment of Archives of California Folk
Music, to be turned over to the Music Department of the University to aid in its sponsrship of this
project, on condition that the Music Department match the amount. 3) Miss Eleanor Hague, who was
asked by the head of the South West Museum to transcribe the Lummis Spanish-American records,
has undertaken to act as intermediaty in arranging re-recording of this material. She found most of
it too scratchy for transcription but there is reason to believe much can be salvaged by skillful re-
recording. The equipment of the Museum of Anthropoligy is, I understand from Mr. Gifford, rather
antiquated; but the Mechanical Engineering people are better equipped. 4) Percy Grainger spent an
afternoon with me recently playing and replaying the material I collected in Arkansas and Missouri.
He offered to send me a set of Gramophone Company cylinders made in 1907 in Lincolnshire
which show interesting relationships with my Ozarks things. The cylinders were made at his request
from the singing of old people in the country and I have no doubt but they constitute the earliest
recordings of authentic English folk songs. If the University wants copies of these for comparative
purposes, I'm sure this could be arranged. 5) Henry Cowell sent a young man to me who has been
studying the music and dancing of foreign groups in this country for several years. He has an
amazing list ofsome 30-odd musical instruments from Central Europe, the Near East and the Orient
which are now in active use in San Francisco and near by. Only three or four of these are "revivals",
like the Irish harp. Recordings of these instruments, with tuning , measurements and photographs
should be extremely interesting.I have done rather more exploring of material around the Bay and
near Santa Barbara and Carmel that I had done when we first discussed recording here, and am
now able to forsee more definitely what can be expected here: A few white American singers who
know many songs, among the old people (this is the group I know least about at present;; some very
AFCCC-COR3-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-2
rare material, as among the Icelanders, which is scantyin amount but very interesting; a great deal
of music, songs and instrumental music, from central Eurpoe and the Near East -- Serbian, Greek,
Turkish, Armenian, Persian, Arab, Assyrian. The Serbian and Armenian groups, in particular, provide
a great deal of material affected in widely varying degrees by comtemporary influences; some if it is
old and [almost ?] Upon reflection I decided I could not approach Mr. Bender or Mrs. Stern for help,
asIdid n't see how this could be done without embarrassing the University, in view of their already
great generosity in so many ways. You see, since the Library of Congress is carrying its share of the
expense, I should have been asking for money to enable copies of the records to be placed in the
University. No matter how I might qualify the request, it was too likely to seem inspired by you. Since
the WPA is to my mind only the means to an end, the real point of any such request is the desirability
of establishing Archives of California Folk Music at the University of California. I could hardly ask for
money for such a purpose without somehow indicating that the University would welcome such a
collection of records! Three of the clubs I approached are, however, considering giving the project
some help and I think that if we can just get started, this will be forthcoming late in the summer.If
the music Department will promise us $100 after July 1st, we can start now by using the money
already pledged. The project is being written up for a period of six months, and I think we can keep
going that long on $200 for non-labor expense, since the Oakland school people can give us space
and equipment, if I keep my travel expense at the absolute minimum.I have today discussed the
present situation with Mr. Pomeroy and he will get in touch with you. I do hope we can work the
thingout and get it settled before you leave. It will require a letter from you stating definitely what
the contribution of the Music Department can be. I should think it would be legitimate to say that the
University will help toward the expense of publication (in mimeographed form) of the results of our
research if, in your estimation, such publication is justified. It is probable that Dr. Herzog's project in
New York will publish anything we do in the way of typological classification in cooperation with him.
I've already been asked to collet a group of western songs and edit them for the series published by
this project, so I feel we can obtain sufficient publication to satisfy Dr. Sharp if enough appropriate
material turns up as I fully expect it will.Cordially yours,
Fresno, CalifMay 15, 1938
Dear Henry:There seem to be so very many things to tell you, I don't know where to begin. My
last letter was about Jugo-Slavs, no? Since then Austin and I have been to Carmel, with our usual
phenomenal luck in finding singers and willing help of various kinds, and, if anything, a higher
incidence than usual of absurd jokes. Carmel performed very well -- we stayed at the Greenes', which
is always mad and amusing, and Tony throve in the midst of that hectic family, everybody talking
at once and nobody listening to anyone else -- he said it seemed just like home. On the Saturday
AFCCC-COR3-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-2
night we went to a Spanish benefit dance on Foam St. in New Monterey and found a surprising
number of Basques, one of whom invited us to a big Basque picnic at Saratoga the next day -- but
when it came to the point we all, including our Basque and his wife, were too tired to go. We were
amused because we'd been told so many times that Basques were unapproachable and farouche.
Originally we'd rounded up about a dozen people who were all to go in costume, just for fun; but
we spent so long arguing Anne Greene and her escort into their costumes that we somehow missed
the rest of the crowd, who never did turn up, so only the four of us arrived, in costume, among the
dignified un-costumed Spaniards. At first they all frowned, then the men thawed; and finally the
women, after we'd bought5¢ chances on dishes, candy, a box of groceries and a millinery order The
music was nothing ---- very bad accordion player --- but they did several varieties of the broom dance
designed to stimulate exchange of partners. This was a new wrinkle to Tony (it's pure American so
far as I know) and he created tremendous amusement by failing several times to get the point, and
the voluble efforts to set him right in three languages there were a few French Basques there too
nearly finished me off. Very late in the evening they played some jotas, etc., on the victrola -- records
provided by the Astec Studio Shop advt. in Carmel. Everybody without exception knew the jota and
several couples danced the jarabe and Anne and I had three or four men and women teaching us
the jarabe at once. Later Anne could n't get over the friendliness shown us, and the ease with which
the ice was broken. All we had done, Tony and I announced in unison, was have a good time! I was
worried once or twice because Annie and Adolph kept disappearing to take a drink of wine out in
the car and for the most part they sat and watched, to out disgust: I was afraid they'd emphasize
our character of outsiders..... just some more drunken smarty Americans ..... but finally they sobered
sufficiently and toward the end they really entered into the spirit of the thingSunday, we chased
cowboys----one odd specimen who used to work at Bettie Greene's stable; another great pal of
mine, one of the famous Radcliffe brothers from Salinas, Bill Radcliffe. He's sixty or so now, but in his
palmy days he and his brothers constitued a famous cattle-thieving gang. They were so well liked,
however, that when they were finally arrested, the townspeople rose to a man and delivered them
from jail leaving the Sheriff under the impression the crowd's intention was to hang 'em. Instead
they were 'admonished', says Bill, and turned loose. When Bill told me this story I inquired [how?]
come he'd reformed. Well, said Bill,[?] youknow they begun building fences all over this country and
it was n't what it had been by a long shot. One day I was coming along a draw and seen 40 steer
and without thinking much about it I run 'em off toward a private corral we had, without thinking
what I was doin'. Then all of a sudden I come to and I says to myself, what the hell are you doing,
Bill Radcliffe, 2 with a measly 40 head o' cattle, you what' run all of 400 head off all by yourself. I was
disgusted, it warn't worth it. So I quit. Bill has had an awful lot of bad luck the past few years, illness,
broken legs and so on, but he's acquired a nice new American wife, a nurse his first wife, if she was
his wife, was a Mexican woman and we had a grand visit with them, interrupted by cowboys from
neighboring ranches who came in to chat of 12-gallon cows, Mack's new fence, the palomino stallion
AFCCC-COR3-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-2
at Matthiot's, and so on ad infinitum Tony and I sitting by fascinated. Bill is going to introduce us to
his vaquero friend Buffalo Booooofallo, Gene Rodriguez, on the Laguna Seco ranch.The best bit of
Monterey County vaquero exploration we really did yesterday in San Francisco a really remarkable
piece of hunch-following.I was technically starting for my father's ranch at Fresno but Tony and I
got into one of our interminable conversations and he undertook to ride as far as Colma with me
(where I was nearly diverted for the fifteenth time by Tony's desire to explore the Serbian, Greek,
Chinese & amp; etc. cemeteries!) ... anyhow, we started over the shoulder of Twin Peaks and I cut
across a new way and found a surprising number of n ew houses, and one old-timer whose shingles
were being bricked over little by little This house stands on a huge corner lot with a superb view in 3
directions and the lots were piled high with second-hand brick - plainly somebody was having a good
time there. Tony announced he wanted to live in one of the buildings, which proved to be a two-story
shop building witha perfectly livable lower floor which, a/as, lacks all plumbing as yet because, says
the owner cheerfully, the depression ruined my credit! We just walked in and interrupted the sawing
and the Brahms Fourth playyed FFFFFF on the radio to chat with a quite unastonished, friendly man,
name of Garritt Moffett . It seems that he was one of the craftsmen that Mack gathered about him
in Monterey but the depression made it impossible for them to earn a livin there so the various
workers had to give up their lovely freehold homes and scatter. But: Songs? Says Garritt, sure and
he starts right off in Spanish. He plays the 5-stringed banjo, the guitar, and a one-stringed violin
invented he says by an acoustician from New York which turned out to be the good old rebec,
exactly. Better yet, he knows a dozen old timers who sing, and he reeled off their names. Finally we
cooked up an expedition to Monterey soon-- I said I'll furnish the beer! I still think that 's not doing
so badly -- we just felt that either we knew, or else ought to know, the people living in that house ....
Garritt Moffett went for years to the dances [?] at the Carmel Valley Center ? on the edge of the
Marble ranch... where they did (he says) the Varsvieenne to a special Carmel Valley tune.... also lots
of polkas, etc. You had to belong to the Farm Bueau to come that kept out Carmel. How the real
people thereabouts do hate Carmel! Tony was offered a job as guide at the Mission, $30-40 a month
for afternoon work, and two rooms at the Mission looking toward lobos, to live in.. for the summer.
He is intrigued but doubtful, he is n't sure why, and I'll be interested to see how he decides.Today
I wet to the Armenian Cathedral, and will write about that tomorrow I'm, getting, thank goodness,
sleepy. Also we did some pretty good hunch-following in Monterey our last day there, and found
a most wonderful old lady from the Asturias named Maria Garcia, who runs a modest Spanish
restaurant in tye "Oldest Brick House in California" and sings, my goodness! some so very Arabic
tunes, I nearly had a fit. We sat for four hours, she talking to Tony in a [Spanish?] so clear that I
understood almost every word and finally felt immerused in the language was sure I could speak
it too.... so I launched bravely forth only to find the words come out in Italian, to my disgust! Then
Tony unearthed some remnants of "old Spanish-Calif. Families" with songs. He automatically takes
on the ladies, I the gents, incidentally...very neat. May 16 Maria Garcia lived near Orviedo originally,
AFCCC-COR3-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-2
and she told a long nostalgic tale about the young ladies who used to come out from Madrid to
spend their vacations on her family's farm ...... the picnics, long rides, and walks they took....... The
Asturias region has not of course been fought over during the revolution but few people have any
money now anywhere in Spain, and even if you do have money there is no food to be had, so she
worries about her family. Some relatives from near Barcelona have come up to Orviedo because
their farm was in the way of the armies and was destroyed. Whether she sympathizes with Franco
or not, she gave no indication that I could catch. She spent 8 years in the Argentine before coming
to this country, and sang a number of Argentine songs, two of them very Moorish in style, I was
surprised. Her singing varies in style with the song surprisingly ---- and a good many of the songs
were very Oriental --- others cast in the naive La Paloma general style.This typewriter's margin dingus
is out of whack.Maria said she would record songs for us, but se wants her son to be present as
she sings better when singing to accompany his dancing .... so much the better of course!She is a
really remarkable woman. She has taught both her son and daughter to dance; she spent a week,
two years ago, teaching Spanish cooking in the cooking school at the Emporium, and she had very
shrewd notions for better team work among Italian fishermen of whose intelligence she is very
scornful. It seems that nowadays the commission houses post a notice: Wanted, 10, or 20, or 6, tons
of fish today. Then all the men go out, spend 40 or 50 dollars on gasoline, and each bring in the
required amount. Thus the price of the fishaccepted is forced down, and all but one or two of them
have had their trouble and expense for nothing. Let the union, says Maria, insist daily on a report of
their needs from the commission merchants; then let the men rotate, and on the days they make
nothing they at least will have no expenses. But, says Maria further, you can't teach them Italians
nothing. The canneries are closed now, until next month, so times are bitterly hard. Last season was
n't a good one, either. She mentioned that some Italian tenants in a house of hers have been unable
to pay their rent for 16 months, and they have so little food that she takes them the beans, etc., left
over from the restaurant. [How?] can I let those people go hungry, when here there are beans?, said
she. At least we others always eat, and what I make extra for the restaurant I have to do anyway
and often it is not eaten ...... excusing herself lest we think her 'soft'.The most interesting music I've
heard in this state was at the Armenian service yesterday, and the service itself was entirely new
to me and very intriguing in form. Did you know that one part of the very long service, which lasts
over 2 hours minus the sermon, is called the Rite of Peace? and that the congregation exchange the
kiss of peace along themselves.... the kiss goes from the celebrant of the mass to the deacon and
from him to he men and women the men sit on the right, the women on the left, each member of
the congregation nods right and left over the shoulder of his 2 or 3 nearest neighbors, saying "Christ
is risen," to which the reply is "Christ is risen indeed, my friend." This is part of the regular Sunday
service, and the celebrant and those prepared take communion every Sunday too. The service was
chanted and sung almost entirely ..... by the priest 4 according to the most ancient traditions or so
- was informed, I am not yet sure about this but it seems likely from what I could judge and by the
AFCCC-COR3-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-2
choir according to the dispensation of the choir master, a priest who seemed rather disliked by the
congreation, or those members I met. The music sung by the choir is a service composed by him,
and (I was told) he intends the music shall not go out of his hands during his lifetime. It is interesting
music in many ways but I am curious to show its basis .. as the organ is used with it (playing only
a chordal accompaniment, with far-from-ordinary harmonic progressions) it can hardly however
be of very ancient tradition. The choir doesn't know all of this music very well yet, but sings with
a will, and occasionally the leader seizes the melody and goes off with it himself at a great rate.
The tunes are repetitive and could easily be written down. A few of them were Gregorian but more
were not .. I mean the melodies were Gregorian--- but the style of singing was not, at all .... Then
there were two long tunes full of augmented seconds ..... The choir consisted of perhaps 15 girls
and women, and the voices were rather insistent and piercing. No Oriental richness of intonation ...
[even?] everybody sang every note right in the very middle, like Epaminondas with the pies.The
priest and deacon, on the other hand, chanted in intricate curves like rabic script, with great dynamic
variation, shadows and highlights, and the subtle pitch variation like Turkish music.... Oh, that
reminds me I forgot to tell you about my Turk in Carmel---- that will have to be for later.Twice during
the service the Host is carried clear around the altar, and at one point it is carried in procession,
followed by the choir and the catechumens, clear around the church from north to south. After
the benediction the congregation is given fragments of unleavened bread, like a thin bleached
tortilla --- bread blessed during the service and eaten, so the woman said who urged me to accept
a piece, in sign of fellowship.It seems the Armenian service is cast in a language much older than
the current spoken tongue, and because it is now so little understood, they have recently published
in (in French) a missal with an English translation on the right-hand page. This also contains about
20 of the melodies ordinarily but not in this Cathedral used for the service, taken? from a collection
made in India and Persia 20 years ago. The congregation is noticeably elderly, and the preface to
the missal comments on this as a general situation in Armenian churches everywhere, which the
English text and rather full explanation of the ritual will, it is hoped, tend to change.Twice during
the service the ministrant stood close to the altar and a red silk curtain with a great gold cross on
it was drawn across behind him, concealing him for 10 minutes or so while the choir continued
to sing. He is not apparently exposed to the gaze or the congregation while he blesses the bread
and wine nor while he partakes of the Eurcharist himself.Miss Kalusian, a Sunday school teacher,
from whom - borrowed her Missal to read during the long sermon in Armenian, had a pamphlet of
instructions for Sunday school lessons which included `blackboard talks' for which one lesson plan
lay open to my gaze during most of the service. The recommended [?] legend recommended for
insription on the blackboard read:>SELL --- GIVE(picture of money bags, with [suppilcating?] hands
below)Then a large cross, and one wordsFOLLOW ME 5 I could n't help thinking there was something
peculiarly Armenian about that! Miss Kalusian gave me her phone number and offered to take me
to meet the ladies' which sounds like an American Ladies Aid and in extra-ordinary contrast with
AFCCC-COR3-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-2
the sense one had of the Orient during the service. I gather she belongs to a different church and
that for her, coming to the Cathedral is an occasional form of extra religious exercise.The priests
were bearded men with bristling eyebrows, very terrifying to look at, and several of the old women
in the congregation looked at me so fiecely I was glad of the light of day. The service contains some
good round curses on unbelievers and I was formally told I might stay through the [entire?] service
--- apparently this is not usual (for non-communicantts) for at one point there is a brief ceremony for
the dismissal of non-communicants by the deacon. As I inquired about the chanting of the service
at the door, however, I was told to disregard this, though I had no idea what they were talking about
until I read the missal.The hours and hours of sitting through long harangues in Finnish, Serbian,
Japanese, and now Armenian, that I have done lately! dear me. You know, I really like it and am
never bored, no matter how incomprehensible it is.It was too bad that Tony stayed behind in S.F.
this trip. But I hope to bring him down here with me another time. We have designs on the [King?]
City Rodeo next Saturday, where we have a tentative date with one of my vaquero friends from
the Carmel Valley.Oh, about the Turk------knowing nothing about Turkey I am not very intelligible
about this,and must ask Tony again what he told me. Perhaps you remember Steve Patterson's chop
house, or grill, or whatever he calls it, a block north of Stanifrod's Staniford's drug store in Carmel?
Bassett used to take his crew there for breakfast regularly at dawn on Friday a.m., after we had been
up all night getting Pacfic Weekly out..... So Steve and I are old friends, and indeed, when I [came?]
back to Carmel he greeted me as warmly as anyody, I was touched. He is a Turk (a Greek, Tony says)
from Constantinople. His stories always fascinated me, but I never inquired about music and was
astonished, the other day, when I asked, to discover that Steve knows ( probably) hundreds of songs
in different styles, and that he comes of a small group of Greeks whose history is very interesting
but about which Tony will have to tell you as I've forgotten the details. Culturally apparently they are
of great interest. Steve sang us a few songs as we sat at the counter -- and they are so beautiful! He
doesn't think much of his voice anymore, of course; but his singing was so smooth and controlled,
and the melodic line so intricate..... so entirely un-Occidental. He plays the oude, the violin, etc., and
music-making was apparently the constant occupation of his entire family ....... and there he has
been right under my nose for six or eight years! His name is not, of course Patterson. He is a quite
remarkable individual in many ways. (Steve died before I could record him. This is my first visit to my
father's fig ranch near Fresno in 15 years. I am never going to find Fresno and exciting place to live,
but the ranch is extremely comfortable, and the vines and trees are thick around the big brick house,
and the lawns thick as mattresses, and the garden full of roses, and altogether it will be pleasant
to be here for a while and sun this cough away --- I still spend about 3 days out of 7 in bed with it.
Quite a lot of mone seems suddenly to be forthcoming for our project, through the University's kind
offices; but there are still forms Address here is Route 10, Box 424, Fresno..to fill out and people
to see, so I must still go back and forth. I have a swell 5-page letter from Herzog, dated May 8th, in
answer to one from me dated Feb. 15th! so I have ceased trying to hurry any thing! But Herzog is
AFCCC-COR3-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-2
very cordial and helpful. He saw Elkus last week and says they "agreed on the value of my planning."
I purr. I phoned Wolff and for once said everything I had to say in the order in which I wanted to say
it,--- he laughed very much at one or two things. Probably by this time you will have seen him.I keep
meaning to outline the project plans for you, as they now stand, and ask you for a letter endorsing
and criticizing, but I always get off on something else and then, suddenly, it is time to go to bed....
as now. I hope you can spare me a letter within the next two or three weeks....... [?] after I write a
real letter on the subject.Warmest regards, Henry --- the very best luck to you..... The more Tony an
I enjoy ourselves the more consciously we miss you. But our kind of expedition is never finished,
and I shall be greatly surprised if we don't manage to go about together, the 3 of us, before so very
long.As always, Phone: Pomeroy Greene Sharp Lomax - Edgar C.S. Beck Edgar mc EDGAR [-?] [Slam?]

Mrs. H. P. Van Sicklen, SecretaryThe Society of California Pioneers456 McAllister StreetSan Francisco,
CaliforniaDear Mrs. Van Sicklen:Some time ago I addressed the Society of California Pioneers, among
other groups, requesting financial and other aid in establishing a project to record folk music in
California. I am writing now to let you know that we have obtained the necessary money, and that
we would appreciate very much having the endorsement of the Society regardless of its ability to
provide any of the funds we need. There is probably no other single organization in the state which
could be as helpful in directing us to contacts with old-timers, and a letter giving assurance that we
may draw on your sources of information from time to time would be greatly appreciated.The Works
Progress Administration is undertaking to establish this project in California, under the sponsorship
of the University of California and the Library of Congress. Our chief purpose is the establishment
of Archives of California Folk Music at the University of California, and a set of all records made in
California will be put in the Archives of American Folk Song at the Library of Congress in Washington,
D.C.I hope further to do a certain amount of research in California source material --- chiefly the
published volumes which list of otherwise indicate songs which were current out here during a
period antedating the musical memory of anyone now living who might sing for my recording
machine. As it happens there is considerable material of this sort in volumes on California history
which are not particularly rare. I do not hope to be able to conduct a really exhaustive search for
mention of old songs, but rather to match the best-known songs with their tunes so that we may
issue a selection of early and authentic Califrnia songs for the use of schools and drama groups.
This should not necessitate burrowing into manuscript or perishable newspaper material. If by
AFCCC-COR3-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-2
good fortune we are able to pursue our research into such material later, I should expect to have
especially rare or unique material microphotographed to prevent damage through handling.If,
therefore, the Board of Directors of the Society of California Pioneers would indicate its willingness
to act as co-sponsor of this project for the establishment of an Archive of California Folk Music, I
feel such endorsement would help materially in what we are trying to do. The Society's contribution
as co-sponsor might then consist of permission to use certain of its library materials, in a modest
way, occasionally; and a further and invaluable contribution might be your help in running down
traditional performers for recording --- old time singers and fiddlers. It is a great saving of time
and travel expense if I can obtain advance information about people in various communities who
haveinformation or interests which parallel mine.I should of course expect in each instance to satisfy
you, or anyone the Board cares to designate, that our use of your materials may hope to be justified
by the results, and that we will treat them with proper care. If as I go about the state I can do any
small chores for the Society, I should be only too glad to 2 do whatever I can.With respect to your
present collection of music, about half of it will be of interest to a study of folk music in California
and the rest would certainly interest students of various aspects of California's musical history.
Anyone interested in the publication of music in San Francisco should find material of real value
among the old songs you have, for example. There is one item which was copyrighted in 1833, and a
numer of things from the years 1842-53. They do not relate to California history particularly, for the
most part, but as evidence of the reportoirs current among amateurs of music here in the Seventies
and Eighties, the collection is of real value. When my proposed project actually gets under way, we
can list this for you and perhaps obtain further information about certain items.Cordially yours,SR/
saP.S. The letter I request should be addressed to Dr. James B. Sharp, Coordinator ofStatiatical,

Dear Sidney - What the hell of a fine friend I am anyway! I certainly do deserve your censure for
such unpardonable delay. I cannot remember ever delaying so upon a matter of recommendation
- and it would seem to be the one I would most like to put through immediately. Well, here is the
stuff. The letter to Sharp goes with this - air-mail. To assure you I could give you a photograph of
my desk with the Sharp letter on it, sporting an old air-mail stamp I had to paste on.Apparently it is
no secret that the crafts side of the KL laboratory is going over to WPA on July 1st. Nick expects to
get on to the Recreation Division under Sally and I, into the Music Project at the same time, though
why not sooner no one seems to know. I feel that Sally is largely responsible for the whole thing,
though AJD has done a pretty [?] smart piece of work. I think I can ask you, therefore, to hold those
AFCCC-COR3-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-2
30 blanks in readiness to send to me PDQ when I can get AJD's formal permission.By the way, I think
you should know of a queer mix-up in the minds of the Rindlisbacher people. They thought that
old Garwick was Mr. Sidney Robertson and asked "who was the young woman if she wasn't ...etc."
We had the craziest conversation ntil I discovered that they thought you were a man. They said
you promised them all copies of the records you made of their playing, but that they have never
received any. Can you clarify that?I had a long talk about you with Herzog. I dont know what he wrote
of it, but I outlined a number of things that have occurred to me about recording since we worked
together.. He said he'd forward them - putting the mike close to each instrument or voice in turn in
an ensemble, taking the tuning of instruments on the record just before or after recording, pictures,
PICTURES, lots of documentation, including the pertinent folk-lore, more leisurely work, more talk
by the performers on the disk - before and after, checking of words with the performer, the same
performer singing interesting material at different times, different members of the family singing the
same song, recordings of play-party games and square dances with particular reference to getting
the calls, noise of action, etc. This is particularly important when foreign language minority groups
are being worked with - their relation with their environment. Yes - stories, conversations, riddles,
etc. You see I am getting more folk-conscious.I expect you will be getting a swell lot of material and
look forward to hearing it. As soon as I can after getting started on the Music Project, I am going
to propose a clearing house for music folklore. Botkin will back me up in the Writers' Project and I
know Evans will, and Cahill too. I think we'll get a system of coordination or at least exchange going
soon. Thus, we shall be able to swap copies of what we have. If my unltimate expectations develop
here (which they should by January) the whole business will [?] be in the way of being straightened
out. You're activity in California will be a factor of no little importance, for as far as I can see it is
the first large scale and compeent entry of WPA into the collection business.Alan has just made a
most interesting series of recordings - Old Lellyroll Martin, early jazz and swing player, has talked
played and sung onton about 50 disks and countless hours of talk have been taken down short-
hand. The bridge between folk and popular art is most interesting to trace. You, in California, have
a chance to contribute in a unique way, for our scant information tells us that San Francisco figured
along with New Orleans, St. Louis and Chicago in that early history from 1890 to 1915. It might pay
you to enquire into the survival (possible) of players and singers in the prewar dives of the Barbary
Coast and Chinatown. (The more disreputable the better!)Botkin is a new addition to our group. He
is really fine. Have you read any of his stuff on regionalism? You should play it up big in defining line
Californian field. He has a somewhat unwieldly but meaty article in the volume of papers published
by the Second American Writers' Congress.I have a paper coming out in the July number of the
Magazine of Art, published by the American Federation of Arts, Wash. I hope you will be able to see
it.Hamp blew in a few days ago. Nothing new. Same old game.I metaa man not long ago who had
attended a convention of the STFU in Oklahoma and heard the whole gathering of many hundreds
sing John Handcox's songs. JH was there and lead them. Must have been exciting. T e book of labor

songs gets a bit nearer publication every now and then. The addition of Alan's stuff is important. Do
you get anything of that sort out west? Send it on, if you can, andwwe'll prorate you in accordance
with the scheme I think I sent you once.Do forgive me a write soon CS
2850 etc.June 29, 1938
Dear Charlie:Thank you and thank you. Your letter to Sharp was overwhelmingly kind and I still
blush over it. Somany things crowd to my mind to say that I don't know whether I'll ever get caught
up --- the more so as half a dozen people lie in wait to snatch this typewriter from me, even when
I stand up to write ..... I'm home again and even went to a Swedish Party and danced the hambo
last Saturday at Neptune Beach in Alameda, which was taken over entirely by 11,000 Swedes and
Finns. The hambo is wonderful, a very hectic polka in which the lady is swooped around the room
at a mad rate. This was the first such party I've attended where the young people shouted as loudly
for the traditional group dances as their elders.. and the floor was too crowded to breathe during
hambos, polkas and schottisches, and half empty during fox trots.One young man said to his party
near me as they applauded for a continuation of hambo music That's the best dance of them all, ---
breathlessly. This was the Mid d summer celebration..... I've been in bed recuperating ever since, but
it was worth it and actually I'm not so badly off, I do get out and around whenever I'm sufficiently
determined.'My' project is now out of my hands and going on its way--- the University has approved
it and guaranteed the money (which it's getting from the State Relief Administration, incidentally,..)
and it should be on its way to Washington by this time. In maybe a month I'll be at work again,
imagine that! I have n't raised the question of my health, of course, because I fully intend to be quite
well by then! but even if I'm not, I expect to have quite surprisingly good assistants and propose
to wangle through. Halpert's old pal, Betty Ryan, suddenly proved to be a citizen of NYC and has
returned to his project. But Mr. Lawton unearthed an even sweller gal for me, Sivart Poladian, who
took her M.A. in at U.C. in music with a thesis on Armenian folk music (out of a book--- I mean, she
used a published collection) and the thesis is really a grand piece of work. Sh has had all kinds of
business experience working her way through U.C. as well, and is a delightful person, so I'm pleased.
Happily she is eligible for certification. She is as difficult as Dr. Brown of sainted memory ever was,
however, about getting the 'originals' of Armenian tunes and disregarding the present form here
now. But I trust she can be cured of that.Had a visit with Henry the other day and he said he'd
heard from you so I half expected that you were beginning to come to life. `I was so amused at
your difficulties over your job, and sympathetic: it has been too funny for words out here, and it is
just under 5 months since I started the organization of this project by talking to Giulio Silva of Fed.
Music (one of the few really intelligent musicians on the S.F. project. Old Hertz, with his genius for
nabbing good-paying jobs and doing nothing, is Cock of the Walk in the Bay Region.) Silva is S.F.
AFCCC-COR3-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-2
director. "All I do," he said to me with a smile, "is just try to make a leetle music." I enclose Randall
Thompson's Americana text, which Fed. Mus. did out here. I was more taken with text than music;
the performance was really very good, though I understand it was done even better, later, by the
UC chorus under Thompson.For two or three months I've seen only S.F. papers and practically no
magazines and during my last visit with Henry I kept saying: "Why, Idid n't know that!" about various
New York doings that he'd seen in the NY Times. Finally he said laughing: "Well, you just come over
here regularly and I'll be only too glad to keep you in touch with what goes on in the world!" which
for humor and courage takes the cake, it seems to me. Prospects of his release seem better than
they have been. Medical opinion is unvarying that he should be released but the prison board has
hitherto refused to except the opinion of any doctor paid by the patient. That eliminated Hery's very
swell psychiatrist, a well known Vienna refugee of five years ago, Dr. Wolff. Dr. Wolff then rustled
around and interested the famous Dr. Meyer, dean of psychiatrists in this country, when the latter
was in S.F. for the 'convention' of psyc iatrists which immediately preceded the A.M.A. convention
herelast month. Dr. M--- sent his assistant over to interview Henry. "I was too flustered," and Henry
candidly, "to ask to have his [name?] repeated when I did n't catch it." But it seems said assistant is
related to a young man whose name I've forgotten, though Henry told me.... someone you know
whose music you recently praised in a letter to Henry. Dickinson? Hutchinson? or something...
Anyway, the asst. was to report back to Drs. Meyer and Wolf, and Dr. Meyer proposed to interest the
convening psychiatrists and get a group statement from them on the subject, which should weigh
with the prison board if anything can. No publicity is to be given it at first, anyway .... so shshshshshs.
Henry did n't specifically ask me to write you this but I'm sure he'd be glad to have your mind and
Ruth's relieved to this extent. Then: It seems when his case came before the parole board their
refusal to consider his parole was based on a statement of unknown source to the effect that Henry
had been in prison before for the same offence. Therefore he was treated as a second offender
and the statement that he was a "dangerous criminal" was read into his record at San Quentin.
Doug Short, his attorney, was shown all this recently for the first time--- apparently they seem to be
relaxing just a little, as they were even willing to let Doug know that the prison physicians consider
him safe to be released. The problem now is how to persuade the prison board to save face and
yet go back on their oft-repeated statement that no sex offender will ever be released during their
jurisdiction. The statement that Henry had been arrested before is of course entirely erroneous,
it needs hardly besaid. You'll understand how extremely important it is to keep all this under your
hats for the moment...... The source of this mistaken information seems to have been a defamatory
letter which was written when Henry was first arrested ---- somebody going a little nuts among the
neighbors, probably.Lemme see, what else: Sally, bless her energetic heart, seems to have thought I
was asking her for a job and she set to work like mad apparently to arrange me one. But it is n't quite
like that..... for 'political' reasons connected with building up his job, Sharp likes to line up all possible
'cooperating agencies' --- at least I think that is it. Also it is only good sense, when I say material
AFCCC-COR3-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-2
useful in recreation can be found, to ask the recr. people if they agree. Zanzig wrote me a letter out
of the goodness of his heart despite his profound disapproval of the song sheets! and of the 'bad
singing' of folk singers. "Cooperation is our Aim" nearly slayed [md] slew him; apparently! both for
the reason that it 'sings badly' and because he pointed out that you don't achieve cooperation by
singing about it but by doing something together! Of course he is dead right on both points, and
I explained you would not have chosen that particular song except for pressure from the coop.
educ. people. Zanzig is a perfect darling, I've always been crazy about him, and I've never seen such
a perfect job of managing groups and producing beautiful singing with any group no matter how
awkward or reluctant or shy, the first shot, as he can do --- it is miraculous, really. But of course he
is thinking in such different terms..... He said: Look out, child, or you'll turn into a scholar! which,
considering that scholars seem to consider me a little tainted by recreation and prog. educ. notions,
tickled me. Zanzig disliked the records VERY much because, forsooth, they were so badly sung! even
Mr. Russell of Marion Va failed to charm him. After he had heard the record and expressed himself
I withdraw my request for a letter, but he insisted on writing one anyway. I told him if we published
any songs strictly for recr. groups we'd ask him to try them out with some of his groups first, which
he said he would do. He is a person-of-one-idear, like us, only the idear is different; but the one-
idearedness makes us kin anyhow. He is doing a superlative job in his line, ---- extension courses
for leaders, at universities through the country. He is a city worker, primarily.... disapproved of the
Dodger because it fails to help toward mutual appreciation or different kinds of people! and I told
him he was taking it too seriously, that it was playful, the sardonic middle west which somehow he
fails to sense. I thought his opinions worth repeating, as coming from one of the smartest of his
kind in the country. I would give a a nickel to know what he wrote --- what he found to say! I pointed
out that folk singers had a style of their own, etc..... not unlike the Oriental placing of the voice and
(with waggles or finger in air) Oriental melodic line, a continuous curve instead of the occidental
series of fixed points. But that does n't interest him, natrually enough, though his group got the
point and was interested. However..... it's all jammy..... the more points of view the better!I must
[wite?] Sally--- she said she was sending you copies on the two letters, [hers?] and mine, so you'll
know about my sweet Jugo-Slavs.... Her point about keeping the lines open for coop. with music and
recr. et all is excellent and something I have been congratulating myself about in our set-up, though
it is accidental, actually--- I did n't have sense enough in the beginning to figure it out for myself.
We are a research project, upart of a big 1100-man U.C. WPA project... and while research seems to
come under Mrs. Woodward, we don't stem directly from any of the ig Federal projects, so-called.
Hence we can coop. equally with music, recr., and drama... and anybody else interested. Elkus wants
to do some [typelological?] analysis a la Herzog, in cooperation with Herzog, for example..... and
we're going to do some library indexing, at the other end of the scale. I'm' looking forward to much
exchange of material ..... keep an ear to the ground for anything even remoted related to Calif. in
songs, will you? Thanks SO MUCH for the tip about ragtime people in S.F. NYC and New Orleans.....

(you should add Memphis). There must surely be some old boys out here....... An old minstrel
trouper changed a tire for me on Shattuck Avenue in Berkeley a few weeks ago! and he is priceless ---
but be should be 'movied', his elocutionary gestures are beyond words. People like that fall off trees
into my lap all the time, it is a kind of magic. Mother's garage man, I think I told you, turns out to be a
much-interested-in-folk-lore French Basque; and her houseman is a Spanish Basque, who exmplifies
all the things ever said about the Basque temperament, he is priceless.A letter from the hired-man-
of-the-undertaker, now in Redding, Calif., remarked apropos of the Louis-Schmeling fight the other
day: "Gee but the fight tonight lasted quick, did n't it!"I know of Botkin through Vance Randolph,
they are friends.... and of course I have Botkins Play Party in Okla. book, a grand piece of work. I'd
love to work for Botkin from all I hear of him, but feel I should work the thing put here for a few
months anyway, first. I want the experience of struggling with WPA research workers at the bottom
of the [ladder?] for one thing. The experience in organizing the thing has been priceless, but I want
to see if I can work it out and bring part at least of our plans to a head ... hitherto I've always been
a better starter than a continuer, but I expect that's something that can be remedied, with a little
determination. By the bye, I was much interesed to have you say that ours will probably be the first
large-scale competent entry of WPA into collecting..... and that's a statement I'd love to quote but
am afraid you are mistaken ...... I am not sure how or where but collecting has been done by WPA in
Oklahoma and New Mexico (under Campa of Univ. of NMex at Albuequerque) at least. Halpert went
into New Jersey and I believe New York.... and of course JAL's foray under Hist. [Reo?]. was not a small
undertaking. All of this was probably done by a single worker, however, except that I think the N.
Mex. one may have been bigger, but do not know. In all those instances recording has been done on
disks. There are undoubtedly other places where this has been done under WPA --- perhaps in Texas.
I saw an article clipped from a NYC paper saying that Fed. music had collected about 2500 American
folk songs. Was all of this on paper, for Pete's sake. Oh, there was also [Gellert?], who worked for
Halpert for a while.I've thought of 'my' project as a very small one --- it does not even technically
cover all of the state of California, due to administrative separation of this state into two.... a la North
and South Dakota. So theoretically I cannot go south of a line drawn just south of Bakersfield hitting
the coast just north of Santa Barbara. But my disappearance from the district for brief periods will
be winked at just so I don't ask WPA to pay mileage outside of N. Calif, I am told. The city of L.A. is
a real field in itself, and later I fully expect to raise a little Cain until arrangements for extending the
project can be made, because after all it is a little silly...... However I expect to be busy enough up
here for a while.I have a plaintive letter from Knott in which she says she feels this year's festival
was better than last; but she says she had the benefit of considerable advice from large numbers
of folklorists, no two bits of which were the sme usually, so it was scarcely very helpful. She said she
"sighed for understanding souls like you (SR) who take life seriously, but not too seriously." In view
of what you wrote this amused me vary much! Of course it is all very well to be folkloristically critical
but I'd like to see any of the nice old boys like for instance Gordan do as well! However perhaps the
AFCCC-COR3-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-2
morning sessions should be definitely curned over to a committee of experts, quite out of her hands,
to present the people who don't show up well on the big stage or who are too limited in their appeal.
It seems to me to be a shame to waste her experience and drive, and really, when you consider the
things she does n't know, the things she does know are quite surprising. It is awfully funny to think
of her teaching at the Univ. of Washington!! no, its Wash. Univ. at St. Louis---- dear me. Speaking of
middle western culture, I had an awfully funny letter from Vance Randolph in which he remarked
that when meeting time came he was ill and unable to present his paper before the Miss. Hist. Soc.
at Columbia, Mo., so lo and behold they gave it to May Kennedy McCord to road --- of all people!
You'd have to know Vance, and the long story about friend May's jealous gossip about him which
at one time seriously and perfectly unjustifiably upset Mrs. Randolph very much, a couple of years
before her death .... I suspect May's resentment resulted from Vance's lack of response to her coy
inveiglements... I don't know. Anyhow, Vance I imagine feels he wishes he lived in a period when
one could remove obnoxious people from one's path without fear of anything but congratulation!
and with cause, for really she is venomous. So his resigned amusement at the turn of events was
droll! (All this is confidential, Randolph apparently says nothing aloud.)Lemme see, what other gossip
do I know?By the bye, in writing Henry about prospective jobs, you know, don't you, that no ex-
prisoner can be paid from Federal funds? Occasionally one gets on WPA --- a manon the Writer's
Project in S.F. the other day gave his last place of employment as San Quentin! --- but not on non-
security wage basis, and not during parole period. He told me this and I imagine wanted it conveyed
to you, as he probably cannot write it....How swell that you plan to come out here! You can probably
arrange to see him more than once, having come from a long distance, if you plan to be here only a
short time. This is almost a routine request and all right to make, though Henry is very anxious no
special treatment or priveleges be requested for him --- so much protest was received by the prison
authorities at first that it created a little resentment and he wants not to call attention to himself
in any way. But when you go to see him the first time, you can make the request verbally as you
leave to see him again before the noraml [30?]-days between visits have elapsed. Conversations
are surprisingly confidential--- they occur in a room full of people and the one or two guards can't
possibly hear you......Oh: I ahppened to be in the phone office at Ventura, Calif., some months ago,
when the phone operator from La Jolla called up and inquired what C.I.O. stood for, nobody in La
Jolla knew. The phone operator did n't either, so just for fun I suggested she call the local newspaper.
When nobody there knew, I confessed I did and gave her what she called the "English" for it.The title
list looks very elegant but I see lots of small errors. In a day or two I will return with all the notations
I can think of .....[most?] of the errors are probably due to my handwriting; but the foreign titles are
surprisingly accur

July 2, 1938.
Mrs. Sidney Robertson,2850 19th Street,San Francisco, California.Dear Sidney: Your letters always
have a kind of tall tale quality about them [md] all the way from your Swedish evening in Austin to
this present exploit, viz: sittng up in a hospital bed and writing me a short article on folk songs in
Minnesota. I certainly appreciate your generosity to the Library and to myself, especially since it is so
much in contrast with the niggling parsimony of the rest of the world.
I have just finished writing to all of your contacts and am now devoting myself to prayer for a week,
hoping that the good lord will intercede and melt their stern academic hearts and dissolve their rigid
regionalism so that I can do some good work in the woods this summer.
I shall let you know from time to time how things are going and I should enjoy very much hearing
about your adventures and exploits on the West Coast. If there is anything that I can do to help,
please let me know.
Yours for more Turks, Assyrians and Portuguese,al/msAlan Lomax

Dear Henry:The project description, etc., has at last gone off --- to Washington, as I understand it.
Mr. Pomeroy, WPA a dministrator for the University, tells me he has signed it. I understand from
someone else that he [md] Pomeroy [md] considers we cannot possibly keep 20 workers busy for
a year on [folk?] songs. Dear me, he is in for a surprise. I have hopes that Miss Poladian's bad luck
in getting a teaching job --- she has tried in vein for 2 years and is very depressed about it because
all the people who have been graduated by the Music Dept in her year, last year, and half of those
who graduated this year, have been placed------ I rather expect that she will qualify for WPA and join
our project. This is of course swell from my point of [?] view, as she has some notion of musicological
research and in addition is trained office worker. She is a natural executive, always thinking for
everybody and one jump ahead of the procession all the time. This is a defect in the field I find but
a great asset to ave behind you among the files and books. She is a most charming person and if
we do manage to get her I shall feel much more secure[ / about the value of any musicological stuff
we may do..... She will be much better than the girl whom Herzog recommended (who has since
gone east) as head of the office, because she [md] Poladian [md] has musical training. She is a little
AFCCC-COR3-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-2
disapproving of her countrymen, or at least superior toward them, alas. I am told it takes 30 days
now for a University project to be approved. Ho!
Calif. Folk Song Project
Meanwhile, I have a long list of explorations with Tony Austin about which to write you. It has more
Armenians, Assyrians (including Joe Daniels, whom you know) Icelanders, Mr. Botica the Dalmatian
bagpipes player, the annual Swedish midsummer festival, more Jugo-Slavs, the Caledonian Society
and your friend Pat O'Neill with his Union pipes, the Nestorians at Turlock, the fiesta de San Antonio
at Mission San Antonio--- I think Itold you a little of that --- and various odds and ends of things. I
can hardly sit still at the typewriter because Tony tells me that almost next door to a Foster's where
we get coffee frequently someone has placed on display two kinds of strange fiddles which sound
like the two instruments variously described as the Hardanger fiddle.....You know I think we talked,
last time, without my mentioning the Icelanders at all, yet I had only the preceding week recorded
among them. Anna had arranged with a young couple who live on the shoulder of mount Davidson
over toward San Jose Avenue, named Phillips, to have a party whenever I should be ready, so I gave
the word, finally, and she [md] Mrs. Phillips--- gathered perhaps a dozen people, most of whom sang.
One very serious gent had a number of songs written out (words) and he paced about nervously
and begged me to hurry up so he could get his chore off his chest! He sang ten or twele songs
of which perhaps half were supposed to be rymur. But I have my doubts about some of them,
because the definitions they could give me of the rymur were so contradictory. One of them was a
'contemporary' song of 1902 or so. It seems that at the end of each Icelandic legislative session it
is customary for various people to write long songs, a verse for each act or the legislature. This bit
of song has survived because the Icelanders thought it so amusing that the legislature proposed to
appropriate money to teach each Icelandic girl to sew and cook. [?] The joke lay, as nearly as I could
make out, in the superfluity of such attempts on the part of the schools when every Icelandic mother
teaches her daughters these things as a point of pride. Among the guests on this night was a Mrs.
Benonys from Berkeley, who is a saleswoman at Roos Bros there, incidentally--- a pleasant white-
haired fine looking woman with a semi-trained voice. She has a brother in Iceland who is a composer
(I am beginning to think the remaining population in Iceland consists of composers exclusively,
this has been said to me so often!) and he has collected and published a volume of Icelandic folk
songs which she promised to request for me. This collection was made about 25 years ago. She
will be very helpful as time goes on I think, because she does n't care about recording herself and
knows in general what is valuable for my purpose, as Anna, bless [her?], is far from doing. Late in
the evening a silent man asked me whether I knew the Passiupsalmer (Passion psalms) and when I
said I did n't he burst forth [tunefully?] as if he were alone on a remote country farm. It seems there
are 50 of these (this is what I was told and I am sure it is not entirely accurate but it is interesting
anyway) and they were composed [md] the words--- by various men and gathered together by one
of them, very early in the Refomation period. They were intended to be sung to familiar folk tunes,
AFCCC-COR3-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-2
and the tunes and words seem to be more or less interchangeable, like the English ballad tunes,
on occasion. There is one of these psalms for each day of Lent, (excepting Sundays, for which there
were special services in church) and they were sung at family prayers in the farm houses all over
Iceland. Each one is a long story about one ofthe New Testament characters... I recorded bits of one
about Joseph of Arimathea and another about Pilate and still another whose title was translated for
me as "Peter on the High Chair." Everyone assured me over and over that this was authentic "15th
centurymusic"- (the 15 yahrhunderts, I suppose and therefore the 16th century, no?) I don't know
whether this is legend or fact,-but the tunes are remarkably like Bach's chorale tunes in form, scale,
rhythm... though, bawled lustily as they were without harmonization the resemblance is not at first
obvious.These people (excepting possibly two of the older men) are not the ones who sang in 5ths
for you..... and the only group singing they did was a dance song, in which Mrs. Benonys sang a line,
the chorus replied in unison, and after repeating all this everybody sang a sort of refrain in unison....
sea chanty or negro spiritual form. Either it was a very dignified dance indeed or their fatigue as
the hour grew late was responsible [md] but they sang it most decorously and slowly.They assured
me that was the way they sang it for dancing, but I really think they were too tired to know.Earlier in
the day Anna and I recorded Mrs. Sigurasson's songs at Laguna Honda, but the old lady did n't sing
as well as the first time I heard her and she mixed things up a good deal and for most of her songs
(she sang at least 20, in two 'shifts') it is impossible to be sure of the melody. However, those records
are obviously going to be useful in stimulating other Icelandic memories --- nothing seems to give a
[ shy?] (singer the [?] urge to perform like hearing a bad performance of something he knows. Mrs.
S---'s Icelandic speech is marvelously pure and clear, everyone said. I was struck by two things with
the Icelanders--- undoubtedly on insufficient evidence, but I'd like to know what you think---- first,
there seemed to be a number of melodies in two parts used for texts whose verses had four lines
instead of two, requiring the repetition of the short tune. As I understand the Eddas are in a two-
line verse form, and as the Kalevala certainly is although it seems to be sung habitually in a 3-line
form by repeating the 2nd line--- I wonder whether those particular tunes might not legitimately be
suspected of being much older than the words, survivals of very early days indeed? When the scale
tones are few and the range small, I can hardly resist this notion.... Second, no two people present
seemed to agree exactly upon text, tunes, or both, to familiar folk songs. Given what you told me
of frequent improvisation among Icelanders, and the narrative, ballad character of so many of their
songs, I wonder whether they don't provide a parallel to our stage of development in American folk
music. Talking with Zanzig the other day, who craves songs for group singing, I realized all over again
what individualists our singers are and what a small amount of folk singing in this country is group
singing (American folk singing, I mean, inthe sense of Ky. mt.. Ozarks, etc.) Group songs are almost
entirely dance songs, singing games and / their relatives... Also we have a bewildering number
of variants in this country, and from what Herzog says somewhere, that is conspicuously true of
American tunes (which he has been trying to classify) when compared with Finnish and Hungarian
AFCCC-COR3-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-2
tunes (where classification has been atempted by Ilmari Krohn and Bela Bartok.) This is conspicuous
when you think how settled in form most German and French tunes are ----, though as I think of it
this may be because there it islargely the dance tunes which have survived as songs...Later, when
the project starts and I ha ve more records, I am to meet with these and other Icelanders again. I
enjoyed them so much --- suche grand people. Thank you so much for the experience, Henry.... I had
an awful time getting the titles straight, everybody spelled Icelandic words at me, nineteen to the
dozen and all at once. On the way to record Mr. Botica's bagpipe playing the next day, we stopped
at Anna's to check these over and Anna insisted on calling up Caroline Cummings, despite our
insistence that we had an appointment and must go on. I did n't know she [had?] phoned and we
were absorbed in checking the Icelandic titles in Anna's little Oriental room, Anna, Barney, Tony and I,
when Mrs.... I forget her name [md] Caroline--- came in, full of conversation and anxious to show us
the pictures of her new house. I was quite honestly scarcely conscious she had come into the room,
as I was concentrating on Barney and Anna against the girls' conversation with Tony and the son-in-
law, and Tony reproached me afterwards for my rudeness. I' did speak to her and then I turned back
to what we were doing without 2 another word. Tony, who had never before seen me as intent on
one thing (Mr. Botica was waiting for us and we were going to be late) was appalled and considered
I had seriously hurt Caroline's feelings. I don't see how I can have, unless she is so accustomed to
the center of the stage that she cannot forego it when there's work to be done. It was a matter of
perhaps 6 or 7 minutes after her arrival..... It is too bad if she was offended as it was not her fault---
Anna should not have telephoned her to come [md] we thought we'd headed her off. Apparently
fate does n't intend C.C. and me to make acquaintance, for a couple of weeks later at a dance rectal
in the S.F. Museum of Art I looked right through her as she passed near me --- she had on a different
hat and I did n't have my glasses on and I really did n't recognize her at all. But Tony reproached
me indignantly again! It is too bad I had to be distraite with the same person twice like that, but I'm
afraid I can't worry about it as much as perhaps I should.I think I'd better conclude this and get it off,
as I can't possibly cover all the ground I want to today anyway----- and there are those instruments
which may be removed from the window any minute --- !You'll be glad to hear I finally had two
letters, a long list of stuff to check over, and an unbelievably cordial copy of a letter to Jim [ Sharpe
Sharp?], from Charlie. He writes that he goes on national staff of Fed. Music to supervise social music
(recreational music) and teaching... WPA. [ July 1st. He says it is n't what he wants but will do for the
moment and as, he says, it is understood [?] the folk music base is to be encouraged [?] it won't be
time and effort wasted. He was complimentary beyond words, both in his letter to Sharp andthe
ones to me, about our project plans [md] and says such elaborately enthusiastic things I was quite
floored, partly with astonishment and partly with embarrassed blushes. He [ says?] the reason he
delayed writing so long was that he lost my letter giving Sharp's title! which is exactly like Charlie ---
only he mentiones mentions casually that he 'gave Herzog a list of suggestions for the project to
forward to you' so I suspect his discovery that Herzog had agreed to act as one of our advisers and
AFCCC-COR3-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-2
his resurgence of interest in the project coincided.... But there, one must n't be fussy... and one can
never hold even his most obviously Yankee calculations against Charlie for long--- at least I neve can.
He writes me further that this will be "the first large-scale competent entry of WPA into the collecting
field" which would be very exciting if true. However Lomax collected for the Historical Records Survey
for about a year [md] result, lots of negro records, an [?] enormous bill for travel expense, and no
work for WPA-ers provided in connection or as a result. Then some woman, I never knew her name,
collected widely with a machine in Oklahoma; and Campa has been fathering a state-wide project
in New Mexico, at the Univ. of N. Mex. Also WPA has gone with a recording machine into New Jersey
and into Florida, to my certain knowledge.Anyhow, apparently Charlie is feeling pretty cheerful, as
you deduced from your letter! I am so relieved that he has a job, they must have had a bad time, as
his salary stopped in January and unless they have both changed enormously since last year, they
never had a cent of money saved. Of course this is largely because Charlie has sons in college and
was contributing loyally to a number of 'causes'; but their vague propensity for getting into elaborate
jams of one sort and another was expensive too. Once they heard that [?] some friends were closing
their NYC apartment for a week [md] friends who had once offered them said apartment, perhaps
a year before, and whom they had not seen nor heard from since. So they sallied forth to NYC
expecting to locate the key through some psychic process. Of course this failed them and when
they still had found no shelter at midnight on Saturday Charlie became very firm with Ruth (he told
me) and they went and registered at (I believe) the Ritz. If not the Ritz, it was a comparable hotel,
and Charlie showed me his $28-for-two-days bill not without some pride! They had to stay for two
days because they could n't find anyone to lend them the money to get themselves out of the hotel
until Monday. There are a good half dozen such stories, complications rainingfrom every direction
in a way one somehow feels could only happen to the Seegers. Once a member of the Special
Skills staff rescued the two children from a drunken farmer's wife with whom the Seegers [?] had
enthusiastically left them (farm life will do them so much good) while they--- the parents--- went on a
long field trip through the deep south and to Arkansas. Being helpless herself with a small son who
had typhoid, Judy persuaded one of the hospitals in Washington, with great difficulty, to take the
children until their mother could return ----- this after frantic attempts to make some less gruesome
arrangement ---- Washington is such a city of transients and of furnished rooms that nobody Judy
knew had room for two small children. Then Judy wired Ruth to come home, not unnaturally. Ruth
wired back pleasantly saying that as the emergency has now been met she saw no reason why she
should return, and thank you very much. The hospital bill was $120 dollars when I returned ahead of
Ruth 2 or 3 weeks later, and I then helpfully preceded to remove the two small tykes, to whom I was
a complete stranger and who were as limp as rags and afraid of their own shadows by that time---
and I took them out to a friend's farm in Maryland. The friends's little boy was visiting an aunt in the
city and came down with whooping cough after we had been there 24 hours, so I and the two small
Seegers had to depart hastily so he could be brought home. If I had had any money at all I would
AFCCC-COR3-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-2
have taken an apartment with them until Ruth returned, but I had only been working a month or so
after six months' [histus?] .... so I returned the poor mites to the hospital where this time they had
to stay ten days; and Ruth removed them as soon as she found a house and got moved. Judy can
rave furiously on this subject to this day; but happily it all seemed too ludicrous to be true, to me ----
except from the pointof view of the two poor waifs in the center of the storm. You see after Judy had
pain-stakingly talked the kids into the hospital then I had to talk them out again without paying the
bill; and then after 48 hours there was again having to back track on all my previous speeches......
Washington is such a city of [wanderess?] that there was no boarding school taking such small
children that had room for two more.....The woman who wrote about mission music is Anna Blanche
McGill, a great pal of mine, a nice white-haired maiden lady in mourning for her sister Josephine who
collected in the Ky. mts. She was a part of the 'folklore front' in the office of the National Folk Festival
people at Chicago --- expected to prevent bad breaks in that field on the part of Sarah Gertrude
Knott, the head of it,-and she managed to rearrange the grammar of the broadcasts slightly, and
so on. She belongs to the [Densmore-Rague school --- and as I seem to have a fatal fascination for
enthusiastic white-haired ladies she quite adopted me.Charlie's job will take him about the country
---- and, he hopes, out here......I have been in Fresno briefly again, surrounded by [Amerians?] two
deep, so have not seen C.S. Smith. I have to see Ed. Lindeman at U.C., too, I am told, though I do not
quite understand why. I had a hasty letter from his assistant in charge in Washington asking me to
get in touch with him -- no [explnation?]. However he's a man I've always wanted to meet, he knows
a lot of things I'd like to know.Like you and a few other people.Must stop, must stop. More soon---see
you soon -- --- all good things to you... Sidney

Dear Herbert:To let you know, hastily, that 'my' project was finally apprved out here after various
absurd vicissitudes; and included in the letter recommending approval by Washington, as a partial
basis for such recommendation, is included the statement that a unit of the Nat. Service Bureau has
[ ? ] asked to publish a volume of songs to be collected by this project.As it turns out we have enough
money to publish, more really than we need, so that we can include some microphotographing of
documents libraries would prefer we should not handle; also some photos of instruments........ Our
sponsor's funds come from the State Relief Administration via the University of California--- money
turned over to the University for use on this project at the rate of $7.50 per man month; ergo, $150
per month, about twice what I was requesting. SRA not unnaturally prefers this to paying $21 or so
per man month on relief; but the joker is that none of this money can be used for travel by someone
not on SRA staff. WPA is giving me a trifle of travel money by a comic process which consists of
AFCCC-COR3-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-2
adding $11 to my salary and then subtracting $30 for a travel allowance so I'll have to hunt up a
trifle more somewhere. Anyway it doesn't matter, there'll be plenty to do.....So, you don't need to
publish our stuff unless youwant to; but I am pleased to note, as establishing a happy precedent,
that you may if you like. We have two superb music copyists on NYA at the University at our disposal
and can prepare the sheets and send to you complete, ready for your photolith process.....As nearly
as I have any ideas about it at all now, I'd like to issue first a sort of combination of Wisconsin-Calif.
songs, a study of the Ford familyr epertoire. Two of the brothers are out here now; one of them in
Wis. continues sending me songs, among them, out of a clear sky last week, the 'Yorkshire Bite' if you
please. Alan Lomax is going up there this summer and will record the older men in the family whom
I missed --- and send me copies or I'll know the reason why;--- and the brothes out here know a lot of
amusing and interesting stuff ----- probably 75 [gon?] songs when boiled down. One of the brothers
who sang for me in Wis., my most fluent singer, is out here now, which establishes the bridge. The
first lot are thanks partly to Special Skills, FSA; the others will be pure unadulterated WPA --- except
for those I've got on my own time in addtion--roughly half. OK by you? Southern Folk Lore Quarterly
wants to see 'em--I thought they might print the 3 rare Child ballads and one or two others, first.... ?)
How are your publications coming along? Do let me hear from you. I've heard not a word from Tony
Ryan since she left; but I doubt whether she has my address. Please tell Herzog for me that we're
coming along, over all the highest hurdles, merely formal ones left now, and as soon as we formally
open I'll write him and get down to cases. Carleton Sprague Smith is out here and asked to see me--
we meet tomorrow.I was so tickled by Herzog's saying he would not go into details, when he last
wrote me, since undoubtedly my plans had changed since my original letter to him. There speaks
a man of experience!Best regards-- as ever... Sidney Tell Tony I'm practically well ---- only recently

This is urgent please - apologies for its length! 70 Avon Way, San Francisco(Please note new
address: samehouse, new P.O. arrangement.)August 5th, 1938
Dear Dr. Spivacke:Hastily --- am writing in dim light in my car on a ferry boat between Oakland ad S.F.
so please forgive errors...First: the WPA project you have been so helpful with has been approved
here and we are waiting for confirmation of that approval from Washington, which is I am informed
practically certain, within a few days.Second: Dr.Eduard Lindeman has been out here and he took
me up on a high hill to show me the cities of the world and I am afraid I succumbed. He offered me
a job in Washington, encouraging collection and engineering dissemination of American indigenous
material all through the country, for use in recreation in this country. A few former Special Skillets
have gone onto his staff and I am tremendously flattered to be included. (Recreation Division of
AFCCC-COR3-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-2
WPA). So many people I know would give their eye-teeth to work under Lindeman, he is absolutely
tops in his rather broad sociological field, in this country; and I really feel I would be an idiot to miss
the opportunity, although like a nit-wit I tried at first to argue him out of the idea on the graound
ground that I must first bring 'my' folk music collecting in Calif. project to birth,--- with my customary
one-track tact, I inquired whether I couldn't wait six months to come to Washington! Happily he just
laughed at me, and finally I agreed to come 'in the fall', whatever that means --- we had no time to
discuss details.Now: I suppose a strictly conscientious person would dash to Sharp, under whom the
proposed f.s. project comes, and tell him all this, particularly in view of his feeling that this project
is chiefly important as allowing me to collect in the field. But I ain't agonna do no such things if I
manage to unearth a possible successor for myself, as I believe I can. The University of Calif. music
dept. really wants the project and the staff is vitally interested in it -- good people there, too. We have
much more money for materials (though less than we need for travel) than we expected at first, so
plan photographs and other trimmings; and the removal of my recorder will not cripple the project
as it can, if put to it, purchase one of its own. The music dept. is contemplating buying one too.If
for any reason there is much further delay in putting the project into operation, however, may feel
obliged to confess to Dr. Sharp that I can't be counted on, whereupon the choleric Dr. Sharp (he is
singularly like JAL) will undoubtedly cancel the project in a rage. Unless I am sure I can play with the
thing long enough to get it in operating smoothly, it certainly would do more harm than good to let it
start. I think this is improbable, as I hope to convince Dr. Lindeman that I will be more useful to him
if I have the experience of the details of organization here first. But there is that possibility that we
may never get into operation at all.So: Here am I, with a car and a recorder and a list of 118 contacts
in this northern part of Calif. In particular I have an Icelander with 5 tunes to which the Eddas are
still chanted, my 32 or so performers on folk instruments in or near S.F., a few rare Calif.--Spanish,
early days-- bits, one good contact in the Robinson Jeffers country, a few lumbermen in the far north
mts. of Calif. and a few-migrants -- also odd bits of Armenian, Assyrian and Basque stuff that I can
get quickly. It is not sufficient--- I mean, I cannot hope to get sufficient material for research in any
one field, such as the University naturally wants; but I can get some good samples of what there is
here, enough to represent Calif. in the AAFS quite respectably, whether the project starts or not. Only
I want to get busy at once. I have only 3 blanks left and having been off a salary for so long cannot
afford to buy any more. Would you get 50 blanks (acetate) out here to me as fast as you can? If the
University will provide blanks they can be dubbed in Washington later, project or no project; but at
least the AAFS will have something from California -- really I should feel myself disgraced to be out
here a year without increasing the sum total of Calif. records by more than the 10 or 12 I hae made
so far --- mostly Icelandic.I shall certainly have requested blanks of the AAFS under every conceivable
type of arrangement before I'm through! But I am well enough to keep busy now and though I'm
poor, my long suffering parents will probably provide me with gas for a while yet!Of course if the
project goes through these 50 blanks I am now requesting will constitute a first installment of the
AFCCC-COR3-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-2
200 blanks you have proffered the project as co-sponsor.I am going to try to use my remaining [?]
blanks and if necessary some Farm Security Admin. aluminum blanks I still have, over the week end,
recording a Portuguese folk play for the festival of San Antonio at San Jose --- if I get confirmation
of the rumor that it is a traditional folk play not unlike the Pastores. I'm so glad to be feeling pretty
well again -- until the past month I had not been free of pain for almost six months --- I had a cracked
vertebra and, unbelievably, did n't know it.Thank you and thank you for all your helpfulness.Maybeso
on this new job I have plenty of week-ends in strange places and can go by car with room for my
companionable little Presto. Maybeso I go into New England, where Dorothy Thompson offered me
a letter to Mrs. Helen Flanders, long long ago. Maybeso a lot of interesting things.C.S. Smith of NY
Pub. Lib, has been out here and of course it would be just my phenomenal luck to be with him when
he made the only really exciting find of mission music that I know of --- he had been to 17 missions
unavailingly, and unearthed this really good stuff at --- of all places --- the Stanford Univ. museum
--- which I blush to admit I would never have dreamed of exploring. I trust it is all right for me to tell
you this! come to think of it I am not so sure he wants it broadcast yet .....My new job is confidential
as yet, please --- it is far from settled yet. But I wanted you to know why I'm requested requesting
blanks so fast, and personally instead of officially..... I hope this will seem legitimate to you.Always
cordially, Sidney Robertson

Mrs. Sidney Robertson, a folk-song collector who has in the past cooperated with Mr. John Lomax
in collecting folk-songs, is at present in northern California investigating folk-music. She has at her
disposal a recording machine and a car but lacks the necessary blank discs. If the Library will furnish
her with the discs, she is willing to record them for the Archive of American Folk-Song at her own
expense.
Since the Archive contains no records from California, I recommend that she be furnished with fifty
acetate discs (cost ca. $37.50).Chief, Division of Music
Please purchase the above records from Radioscriptions, Inc., 726 Eleventh Street, N.W., Washington,

Dr. Harold Spivacke, ChiefMusic DivisionLibrary of Congress, Washington, D.C.Dear Dr. Spivacke:I
was notified today that the project for folk music collecting in California has finally been approved
all around and can go into operation within a few days. We have to rent space and interview
prospective workers, etc., which takes four or five days. So some time next week we should begin to
need blanks blank records and also some blank cards, in accordance with our original arrangement
with you as sponsor. If you have aleady started same acetate blanks in my direction in accordance
with my request made a few days ago when it seemed approval of this project would drag on
indefinitely, so much the better. We'll need a supply of catalog cards, enough to keep 3 workers
busy for a while, also.Would you mind sending me a few sample cards made out to show the form
as finally determined for 1) Indexing of folk music disks; and2) Title index for contents of published
volumes of folk songs.I shall need these to serve as models, since I don't altogether trust my
memory for the details of library procedure. I can get some help from librarians here, of course;
but insofar as we are entering a specialized field, I'd like to provide for the problems that come up.
We'll have at least one person with some library training on the project, and perhaps more -- to
work on these indexes.If the Library has issued any bulletins on cataloguing procedure which might
be useful for my workers to read, would you either mail me copies or let me know how I can get
them? Incidentally, some time ago someone wrote me that you had published an article on indexing
of folksong records, without mentioning where. I'd like to send for that if you will tell me where it
appeared.I believe we did not discuss the problem of mailing expenses for cards and freight charges
on records. Would it seem fair to you if the Library met this cost from Washington to California and
we met the return expense? We have an very unwieldy set-up to meet non-labor costs, as our money
comes from the State Relief Administration to the University for WPA, all on requisition, and I don't
see how in the world we are going to manage some items like stamps.With, cordial regards, I amVery
truly yours, Sidney Robertson

Mrs. Sidney Rbertson70 Avon WaySan Francisco, CaliforniaDear Mrs. Robertson: The Acting-
Librarian, Mr. Roberts, has approved my recommendation that we place at your disposal fifty acerate
discs for use in recording folk songs in California. You understand, of course, that these discs are to
remain the property of the Library of Congress and are to be returned to us as soon as convenient
after the records have been made. For purposes of shipping you will find several franked labels
enclosed.
For the time being, at least, it seems advisable to keep this venture completely separate from the
WPA project in order to avoid any confusion. The Archives is prepared to cooperate in this manner
AFCCC-COR3-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-2
with individual collectors of standing.The material you describe is very interesting, but please do
not neglect any songs of Anglo-Saxon origin which may be available in that territory. Are there any
miner songs still being sung?The records will be shipped to you as soon as possible - twenty-five will
go out today. Will you need the others immediately and if so where shall we send them? Please do
not wait until all these are recorded before sending them to us. For many reasons this will be much
more profitable. After all they are safer here than stored in your car.Alan is now on a recording trip
which will take him through Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. You probably know about Charles
Seeger's new position with the Federal Music Project.With best wishes for a pleasant and successful

Enclosed you will find a photostat copy of my article on cataloging folk-songs and a few sample

Dr. Harold SpivackeMusic Division, Library of CongressWashington, D.C.Dear Dr. Spivacke:I am so
sorry to have confused things by requesting the blanks in two different ways. Enclosed are receipts
for disks and folders and cards. The latter I have not seen yet but I am assured that they are being
held for me at the University.It is too bad you had to wire me, the more so as the records had been
in my hands for 36 hours when your wire arrived. The confusion was occasioned by the fact that the
post office here changed the address of my mother's house to a number on a street that hitherto
had no residences on it and therefore was not in the city directory. Until your package miscarried we
had no way of knowing that; and I daresay the only reason your telegram arrived was that I had just
telephoned around to notify the various agencies likely to have to deliver to us.When the express
delivery people couldn't find the house, somebody had the idea of mailing a holding-till-called-for
card. This got mixed with other papers at the house unfortunately, and apparently by the time I
found it and telephoned the express company, they had notified you of non-delivery.Upon receipt of
your wire I called the express company again to make sure you had not sent me a second box of 25
disks; but they are not now holding anything for me, so the transaction should be complete now.To
add to the general confusion I was struck by a falling tree in a wind ten days ago -- casualties not
serious, just a series of sprains, all slight -- and on the same day my recording machine was stolen
from my car, standing in my mother's driveway. I had left a window open when I locked up at night.
Another is available temporarily, however; and I'll buy a second one if this one doesn't turn up soon.
The mike and other loose bits of gears, needles, etc., I still have, fortunately.Since I wrote you about
my conference with E. Lindeman, I should now explai that when he got back to Washington he found
the set-up there had changed during his weeks on the Pacific Coast and the work he hoped to have
me do doesn't now seem possible. While I very much regret losing the opportunity of working with
him, I am better satisfied to stay with what I've started out here until I feel I've learned what I need to
know about the problems on a small scale. Everybody out here, almost without exception, considers
that I've tackled something that can't be done. Either they feel there are no songs, or else that work
for 20 people cannot be provided. Henry Cowell and Albert Elkus are the single exceptions. I should
have hated to abandon the ship before proving them mistaken. 2 Thank you for the photostat copy
of your article. It is a real help. I will return it soon.

I was discussing the problems with Christine Fredericks, librarian of the music department of the
San Francisco Public Library, and it seems to me that in cataloging records made in the field here we
should leave the choice of the main title to you. But we will do cards for first lines and refrains on the
books we index, with pleasure, and for the records when possible.
Do you want us to type our cards before forwarding to you, or confine ourselves to plainly-written
cards done by hand, to be typed by you later? We won't type for a while, anyway, until we get settled
into our jobs.....
One more query: I don't suppose there is any way of persuading the Audio Devices people to ship
records in a square tin box so that disks and folders be kept together? The presto people who sold
me my records here provide such a box to every 25 or 30 records and they keep the disks clean
in the field and would be very handy for shipping. I certainly don't want to send records back to
yo separated from their folders, as this allows two more points at which errors can be made: [?]
marking them in duplicate, and replacing them at your end.
We are not yet settled in our quarters but will be in a few days.
Thank you so much for all your trouble. I mn looking forward to the time when my work, my
living quarters, my car and my dog will all be settled in the same town. There is certainly a star of
confusion over folk song collectors. I really have done a number of other jobs that ran smoothly
without perpetual explanation and correction and adjustment; but just let me touch folk songs and
immediately everything in connection begins to act as if it were possessed,-- including me.Cordially
yours, Sidney H. Robertson P.S. Enclosed receipts are personal. Now do I transfer them to WPA or the
University for the project, and send you official receipts? Or what?

Mrs. Sidney H. Robertson70 Avon Way,San FranciscoDear Mrs. Robertson: Thank you for the
receipts. We should prefer to have them on official stationary with your proper title under your
signature but these will do meanwhile.
I had already complained about the round boxes for the records. I sent you this rand because I had
heard that they were superior to all others.
Why don't you go to a phonograph store and ask for some of the cardboard boxes in which
they receive their shipments from Victor and other phonograph companies. If these prove
unsatisfactory, let me know and I shall try to get you some square metal boxes.Sincerely
yours,Harold SpiveckeChief, Division of MusicHSmbr

Dear Henry:I wrote the Reno Gazette people just after seeing you, and phoned the News today to
check on it. The girl I talked to could n't tell me whether or not the renewal of your subscription had
come through but said she would check back on it and write for the missing copies since Aug. 9th
also.Yesterday I spent the day with the Molekani on the Potrero hill. Their singing is really something
amazing, and they are the friendliest folk ever. I don't know how much you know about them, so I'd
better start from the beginning. The word Molokan means Milk-drinker; and they believe themselves
to be the first Russian Christian Church, according to the sign on their church building. One of their
members, however, told me that their forefathers were Russian Catholics who seceded --- I suppose
about the time of the Reformation. They are a kind of Russian Puritan, and their difficulties, musical
and otherwise, are so exactly like the history of the Pilgrims I could hardly believe my ears. There
is a small congregation of Molekani at Santa Rosa; and another quite large one in Los Angeles. The
latter call themselves something my friends here translated as "Holy Jumpers" and in general their
music is livelier. The San Francisco congregation seems to belong to an older and more conservative
tradition.The congregation is perhaps two-thirds man -- fine Russian types, blond mostly, short and
stocky; the old men with soft thick beards had beautiful faces, I loned for a camera. The women
all / wear a simple costume which in traditional, and was apparently designed much as the Quakers
evolved theirs -- for the sake of simplicity and avoidance of vanity. They seem to have achieved the
simplicity; but vanity is rampant: I hardly ever knew a group of women, elderly as these are mostly,
who were so fascinated by their own and others' clothes. They dress in white silk mostly for the
morning service, and in soft colors, lavender, pink, pale blues and greens, and delicate flowered silks,
for the evening one. They wear big lace scarves wrapped around their heads in a special way --- the
scarves made of lace, usually crocheted, but at any rate all made by hand, white or cream / colored.

Some of the younger women are beautiful, with straight brows and deep-set eyes. The older women
can't be called pretty; but they are smiling and pleasant-looking. Most of the women of this group
work in the Galland Laundry, day in, day out, and keep track of their enormous families too. Most
of them have 8 to 14 children; and as they marry at 14, 15 and 16 years of age there were several
grandmothers in their early thirties. Mr. Agapoff, who took me home to meet his wife, remarked
that the noticeably barrel-shaped figures of the older women were due to their frequent child-
bearing, a child a year for 10 years or so being considered normal. "Those ladies look so strong
and big and well because so many children has given their insides a good workout," Mr. A-- said
seriously, "These younger women around here are n't good for nothing, they look like cigarrettes
cigarettes." The women's costumes are made long and straight -- with a long overblouse on a square
yoke, high necked, long sleeves and long skirts; and they have embroidery on them, mostly machine
made -- delicately done, not like the characteristic Russian embroidery in cross- [?] stitch [?] or heavy
wool which we think of usually. I have an idea that every bit of decoration was fought for bitterly,
as the right to wear short sleeves to Mass has been in the Catholic Church. [?] During the service
the congregation is arranged in an odd fashion which is dictated by the kind of psalm singing they
do. The chief singers among the men sit on two long benches facing each other. At the far end is
a small table with a huge Bible on it, and the chief preacher and his two aides sit at that facing the
room. Across the near end of the two men's benches are two other benches on which two rows
of women sit facing the men and the table, with their backs to the door. Those four benches hold
the `singers'; the rest of the congregation [?] around the [?] walls, women to the right, men to the
left, and they act as 'helpers' singing with the others as they can. The 'singers' are self-elected. You
simply join the group on the singers' benches if you feel you want to sing -- and can. No is likely to
think he [?] can sing unless he really can, I was told. 2 The psalms sung in the morning are 'sad';
those in the evening, gayer, except for one 'sad' one which is the appropriate mood for preceding
the praying. When the praying is to begin the benches are picked up and sat against the walls and
the group sings standing up and then kneels on the bare floor, -- this three times-. That is, three
short psalms alternate with three rather short prayers. There is also a brief reading from the Bible
by the chief preacher, who looks exactly like Lenin, though the idea would horrify him. The chief part
of both services, and of the children's Sunday school also, is the singing. The difference is that the
children sing hymns taken from a reival hymnal published in Tennessee, in English, and within the
last three weeks an harmonium has been bought for the Sunday School, in the face of as stringent
criticism of ungodly new ways as was ever offered the progressive members of the early New
England congregations. I located the church, in the morning, by the cheerful singing of the children
audible all over the neighborhood; to my great amusement they were singing the revival hymn
"Revive Us Again", which was only familiar to me as 'Hallelujah I'm a Bum'. I knew it was originally
a hymn but I'd never 'met up with it' before.To return to the elders upstairs; I don't know whether
I can make clear what happens during the psalm-singing, although I listened for two hours in the
AFCCC-COR3-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-2
morning, another hour or so in the afternoon and two hours and a half in the evening, and sang with
the women part of the time. I don't understand what the cue is that brings in the second part ....As
nearly as I now know, however, what happens in this: One of the men, on a nod from the preacher
or perhaps just 'as his heart moves him', 'lines out' a line of the psalms, half chanted; another man
starts one of perhaps a hundred (they say) tunes, slowly, and by the time he has sung the first short
phrase of five or six notes others are joining him; as soon as the men get going the women come
in an octave higher; meanwhile the second bench of men starts in canon, sometimes the same
tune, other times a quite different one which gives an effect of antiphony, except that after the first
few notes everybody is singing at once. The front beach of women sings with the bench of men on
the right, all high voices; the second row of women sings with the lower voices among the men, on
the left. In general the women parallel the men in octaves except where the range obliges them to
move in opposite directions to their octave -- that is, they will sing a fourth up when the mentake
a fifth below, to reach the same note. The two melodic lines weave in and out with no concern for
hrmony; but occasionally two of the man with very low voices seemed to make harmonic parts of
their own during two or three long notes only so that momentarily the effect was of three parts
instead of two. Both of the two main parts move freely; measures of 8th notes in one part move
against half-notes and quarters in the other part for a phrase and then they switch around. The 8ve,
4th and 5th of the scale are very plainly what Cecil Sharp called 'strong' notes --- that is, the melody
seems formed around those tones chiefly; when the note values are shorter the passing tones are
embellishments around the others and are likely to be sung differently by different singers; but they
all arive with vigor on the 'strong' notes of the scale. Because they move mostly in conctrary motion
there were few parallel 4ths and fifths; but in only one psalm were consonant intervals noticeable --
one part of one psalm did move in parallel thirds and sixths. I would say their feeling for their psalms
was truly contrapuntal; they don't shout one another down, either, but apparently hear both their
own and the other part. As the singing becomes more and more intense, the singers don't wait for
the liner out -- they all know the psalms by heart anyway -- so his chant becomes momentarily a
third voice. At Christmas and Easter the church is crowded and the singing does n't stop all night
and gets very rhythmical and excited, I was told. But this congregation does n't go in for 'jumping'.
You can imagine how beautiful it was, however, with this average congregation of 90 people, of
which perhaps two-thirds were 'singers'.I forgot to mention that the part lined out is rarely more
than eight-ten syllables; and as many notes are sung to each long-drawn-out syllable, this brief
phrase may result in a musical phrase of thirty measures, though the average seems to be about
16 [measures?]. 3 Mr. Agapoff illustrated the extension of a short verse into a long musical phrase
for me in several ways later in the evening, and although of course I have n't an idea in the world
of the meaning of the Russian words, I was struck with the fact that extra syllables seemed to be
interpolated during the singing, about as if one sang the word 'milk' this way: "Mil-ee-ra-il-y-ka." The
only Russian example I remember is the ward Gospodoy, which I've probably misspelled; it means
AFCCC-COR3-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-2
'Lord'. Mr. Agapoff sang something like this: "Go-o-ro-ossi-po-ra-do-loy". More than one tone to a
syllable even then, of course.I listened outside all morning and then went searching through the
building for someone who spoke English. In the Sunday school room I ran into Mr. Agapoff, who
is the son-in-law of one of the chief preachers and the nephew of another. He was interested in
what I wanted to do (record the whole service, excepting the prayers, possibly and the reading at
the Bible, as I knew this would seem especially sacrilegious to them), and championed the cause
at the meeting later. I was introduced to a lot of people; among them the preacher to whom Mr.
A-- was not related, a pleasant man who said he could not of course decide such a thing alone,
but they would discuss the matter and determine the attitude of the congregation. Mr. A-- said
he would get a group together at someone's house if the congregation turned the idea down, so
at the meeting which followed the evening service I was not alarmed, but only a greatly-intrigued
spectator.Like the Quaker meetings, the church represents a community organisation in which every
man has a voice and a vote; and believe me, they exercised their voices! I did n't remain for the
voting, but am to be informed later. But they let me stay during the discussion, although some of
then were greatly embarrassed by a big man around seventy who shook ? his finger at me across th
big room and urged that the money-changers (me) be cast out of the temple. This was not with a lot
of 'nitchevos' around the room and probably did my cause good. Another man was worried for fear
the records would be put in circulation and be played in a saloon or a dance-hall! and a third man
made a dramatic speech to the effect that the Americans had a symphony ? orchestra, a civic chorus,
and songs of their own so why did n't we leave them in peace? It took them a long time to grasp the
historical idea, of course, although a good many of them had been plaintive about the impending
loss of the old way of singing. In general the younger group (men and women between 50 and 65)
were in favor of the idea; over 65, nothing doing. My friends seemed to feel that the proposal would
go through, however, and that these who disapproved would simply stay at home. It was the same
thing, they said, when they had a Christmas Tree in the church last year for the children. A lot of the
old people classed the tree among the forbidden 'idols'. I had a fine time! Such a spate of Russian;
and such a sense of democracy in the gathering -- men and women alike free to speak. I reassured
them about commercialization of the records, and spoke briefly about the great beauty of the music
they'd brought with them, which the U.S. gov't did n't want to have lost -- the first I ever spoke with
a translator at hand going into action between each sentence of mine. Afterwards half a dozen men
came up with cards and invitations to come home to tea with their families, which of course I shaIl
do --- they are sweet people. At the moment, however, I stuck to Mr. Agapoff and the sweet little
woman who translated for me.Mr. Agapoff has a neurotic wife whom he took me home to meet ---
leading me in the back door down the side of the hill and showing me his Russian steam bath he
has just built, the double bunk in the bedroom, and his wife -- in that order. She is recovering from
a nervous breakdown', due, sid Mr. A-- to 'too much experience we had in our family.' It seems that
when Mr. A-- and his wife were about 14, (they had been living in S.F. since they were 2), their parents
AFCCC-COR3-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-2
decided to return to the old country to escape the contamination of modern city life. But the part
of Russia they had lived in now belonged to Turkey, and their relatives were living along the Don
River in holes in the ground covered over with branches --- they emerged to [greet?] the repatriates
like moles from the ground. No food, no water fit to drink, no way of earning money or procuring
clothes. Finally my two friends married, after two years, and returned to S.F. For a few years all went
well; then the depression hit them, and until the last few months they were in debt and wretched.
"We had too much experience" seems to describe it pretty well. Except that the Molekani were '[led?]
here by God' I have been unable to discover when, where and why; but that will be for later
70 Avon Way, SFSept. 19, 1938
MondayDear Henry:I've been wearing my ring on the wrong hand for several days to remind me to
add, to my account of the Molekan music, the fact that half the time each successive verse of the
psalm is raised in pitch. This is deliberate; the reason one man gave me was that the psalms should
be sung fairly high (for the sake of the most desirable religious emotion), but that as they are very
long they begin low and work up gradually. The effect is exhilarating and exciting, of course, beyond
words, though each rise is no more than a half tone and sometimes barely that.Late Saturday
afternoon I got home from Berkeley and found a message to the effect that I would be expected
the next day -- yesterday -- in the evening, to record the Russian Church service. I had intended to
borrow a machine from the dealer here, with a better microphone which would enable me to sit
in an adoining room; but he had closed up, so I had to do what I could with what I had. The results
are surprisingly good, but the situation was not entirely natural because I had to sit in among the
singers. I was surprised to hear so promptly that the Molekani were willing to have the recording
done, after all the eruption of antagonism to modernity and machines at the meeting I attended the
first Sunday; and I was even more surprised to find that the people who had shouted loudest against
the idea, were the most prominent as psalmleaders when it came to the point. Score 1,100,101 for
democracy and free speech.As usual there were many touching or funny things. They had had a
mid-week meeting it seems, to go over the details, and a committee was appointed to assist me.
Chief on this committee was a man who achieved this eminence because he is working as a wood-
finisher at a new radio station and was therefore known to be on intimate terms with microphones,
etc. During a sort of intermission they had in the service, after I'd started recording, he inquired
whether the bare wooden walls were desirable acoustically, and when I said they were not, he got
up and made a speech about the sound-absorbent walls at his radio studio. This was acceptable
procedure, apparently, much as it might be in a class studying current events. This same gent started
and stopped both the psalms and me, which had the advantage of enabling me to got the psalms
on the record entire, without missing the rather random beginnings which ordinarily follow silent
AFCCC-COR3-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-2
prayer and usually come too suddenly to be anticipated. But of course my helper's care created the
atmosphere of a performance rather then a service, and as a result the psalms only once or twice
reached real [?] heights of fervor. The records, which last only 4 1/2-5 minutes, were too short for a
single psalms psalm, which goes on 10-15 minutes usually. He always stopped the group / when he
saw the record was coming to an end, and he spoke too little English for my whispered protests to
be effective except once. When it came to the preaching, which was included because they wanted
the service recorded as a whole, he insisted on each of 5 men filling a whole side of a disk, and once
or twice made a man get up and read some more verses after he had said Amen and sat down.
However, I made 8 double-sided 12-inch records, which means 11 sides of music --- 9 psalms in
all. I want to do it all again, and as they are talking about having a master-set made of the whole
performance, I shall certainly do it at least once more, and I would really like to do it several times, as
their singing last night was only once or twice of the interesting variety I described in my last letter.
Mostly it was sung in unison (men) with descant (women), or else it was rather ordinary Russian folk-
harmonization, a quite different style from the curious polyphonic singing they did before. It was
extremely beautiful, however, nonetheless. A different singer started the time each time, and two or
three of them had that curious Oriental quaver to each tone, like Arab or Indian music. All the work
of identifying the leaders, and discovering exactly where they each come from, 2 is yet ahead of me.
It is so nice to know that they and I will still be here days and weeks from now, so that I can go back
and get all the various kinds of information I can think of. You know Charlie was never reconciled
to the fact that when I was recording for Special Skills I was sampling, and always in a rush, partly
because there was so much ground to cover but chiefly because if the collecting was too long drawn
out so that the per-record cost hit the ceiling, the recording would be stopped. He was always
distressed ecause I did n't get the complete body of information about singers and instruments that
would constitute solid research material, and as he never had any conception of the limitations of
singers' strength, nor the comparatively short [?] span of their interest and their quick suspicion of
too prompt and definite questioning, I don't think he ever was convinced that I was anything but a
very sloppy worker. If you can hang around for days / or weeks you can gather a lot of information,
much of which you want; and if you can hang around even longer, you can check that information.
But you can never sit with pencil in hand gathering data after a long session of recording; and
it is only people who you've made personal friends whom you can ask questions about family
history, etc. I usually have no trouble getting information about the song the first shot; but you don't
even dare note down the approximate age of your singer until after leaving, since your notes are
invariably observed. I was always in a state of data-indigestion: I always had more information than
I had a chance to note down, and there was always a lot more information I wanted I had no chance
to get. Out here information about the miners and the Oklahomians is relatively simple; but these
minority groups require a great deal more digging than that, and it is great sport, I love it.To go back
to the Molekani: After the regular three psalms they added three more for good measure; and then
AFCCC-COR3-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-2
came the graver three preceding each of three prayers. After the benches are put back the group
stands and sings; then a prayer is begun, standing; at a fixed point all kneel and continue to pray to
themselves, the leader improvising a prayer aloud, and [?] at the end of each prayer, and sometimes
in the course of it, they bow their heads almost to the ground -- it is almost like the prostration
ofthe faithful in a mosque. The last of the 3 prayers is the Lord's Prayer, sung and then spoken, and
the last period of prayer, kneeling, is silent.One of the nice things was the crowded church on this
particular night; there must have been a hundred women, heads all covered with a shawl (mine
too) and more than that many men, some with brilliant long Russian blouses under vests and coats.
A smaller congregation would have been fatal to the recording; the crowd absorbed much of the
reverberation and on the whole the recording was surprisingly good, considering the limitations of
my carbon mike. After the [?] service I played bits of everything back to them -- and such pleased
smiles as there were.Even the crossest ancient who most distrusted me came and patted me on the
back and inquired sociably about my religious affiliations. He and a dozen others invited me to their
houses for tea, and one lady living on Mission Street is going to give a tea party for me. They are the
most engaging people! and much easier to deal with than my beloved Serbs, and more interesting
as individuals than the Icelanders. All Russians seem to be philosophers, and this particular group
has had a rare amount of experiences as basis for its reflections.The old fellow who asked me what
church I belonged to (for two cents I'd have claimed to be a Buddhist!) reminded me of one of my
grand colored lady friends at Henry Street. I used to sing with the colored chorus when William
Lawrence, (for 12 years Roland Hayes' accompanist,) led it, rocking back and forth with the best of
them. As the group broke up one evening one handsome old black gal put an arm around me and
murmured; "Honey, is you a Christian?" I absent-mindedly thought the alternative to Christian in
this instance was Jew, so I nodded. She gave me a great hug and said warmly: "Honey, I jest knowed
you was one of us!" When I was able to gather my hysterically scattered wits, I realized that Christian
to her meant the Christian Churh, a sort of revivalist organization, and I suppose my rhythmical
rocking with the group was some sort of key gesture indicative of salvation, or something. 3 This
recalls another story about a visit I paid to an old Jewish woman up 6 flights of tenement stairs. I
studied Yiddish for 3 months when I first got to the Settlement and was able after a little to chat with
the old people who had never learned any English. On this occasion my hostess inquired whether I
was Jewish; and when I said no, I was n't, she lectured me seriously, herself deeply moved by some
urgency: "You must n't deny your race; it's a good race, it's a fortunate thing to be a Jew." Thoroughly
as I agreed with her that did n't of course make me Jewish; but thereafter I never again 'denied' that I
was Jewish. The question came up so many times that, I asked one of the Jewish staff members what
made other Jews take me for one of themselves. "Oh," she said airily, "It's probably because you have
such a Jewish name!" It was true that I had to learn not to turn around in the street when Mammas
shrieked out their windows for "Sidney!" -- there were three or four Sidneys in our block alone. But
I was rather taken aback because both my names seem so entirely British to me. It seems there
AFCCC-COR3-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-2
are Jewish names which sound like each of mine. But as most of the old people who thought me
Jewish had never heard my name, that hardly explained it. I just gave the problem up after a while,
thankful for so much protective coloration on the Lower East side.Well: How'd I get off so far from
the Potrero hill? As a matter of fact that's about all I know at the moment, about Molekani.I don't
know whether I ever have explained to you that I go so into detail about my experiences recording
when I write you about them because I then keep a copy in my Journal and thus th letters serve as
notes hot off the griddle.... not that I'm apologizing for the details because I know you like 'em; but
as it seems more important to me to get everything in than to get everything in coherent order, I
sometimes stick bits in in odd places rather than let them be lost.Tony Austin tells me that in the
Russian orthodox Church the Credo is sung with gradually rising pitch.I have been studying Fox-
Strangways' book on the music of Hindostan. I suppose you know it. It seems a very important book
for anybody concerned with the development of melodic music, as in folksong. I had no idea of the
extent of the possibilities before, and it was amazing to me to realize all over again how some of
my mountain singers duplicated Indian conventions in singing --- I had never grasped the fact that
Indian musical systems had names for all the characteristics of vocal style in our folk song, along
with innumerable others. You had already made me familiar with the general scheme of rhythmic
development in the drum accompaniments --- dislocation of the rhythmic pattern to make a cross-
rhythm, etc., (so that for two or three years I've delighted more than ever in this side of Bach's music,
incidentally). But I got very excited over something quite new to me, "grace" as F. Stangways calls
on, on the drum. Did you know about this? Probably so, but I had never heard of the ? hour-glass-
shaped drum whose thongs are squeezed to vary the pitch after a tone is struck, and I think that's an
amazing idea.Speaking of amazing ideas, I had dinner with the Cages, and John told me about your
elastic composition notion for the dance, and I really think that 's one of the most exciting things
I've heard in a long time. It's as completely original an idea as if it were [?] pure revelation. If you've
been busy hatching such miracles no wonder you've looked brighter the last couple of mouths.
Don't fail t write Percy Grainger about it --- he'll be as pleased and excited as anyone could wish.
You know it seems to me a very good idea anyway, regardless of its convenience under the special
circumstances: It's high / time the dancer had a greater share in the composition of his music --- you
may have freed the dancer as well as the musician.More power to you, Henry, and a good blessing....
I keep forgetting to tell you: I have finally discovered what 'rymur' are. The name has nothing to do
with use, nor with music: It defines a verse-form, a four-line or five-line stanza with intricate internals
rhymes. There are innumerable patterns for such rhymes; and the rymur-composing contests have
always been a frequent form of social entertainment. The standards seem impossibly hard to us, for
such improvisation; but apparently the character of the language lends itself and even suggests [?]
this sort of thing. One of the most difficult verse-forms for improvisation is one in which each line
reads alike, syllable for syllable, both backwards and forwards. In general it is considered a stunt,
though almost anybody is able to do it --- like charades; and this explans the curious inconsequence
AFCCC-COR3-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-2
of ideas evident when these verses are translated. I don't know yet how many of these patterns are
included in the definition of rymur; but there are at least four I know of. Perhaps different varieties
have other names. They are sung to known tunes, hence the association with dance.

To Henry Cowell Sept 30 1938
The Aran Islanders film is in Berkeley this week, and I'm going to try to see it.I called on my Armenian
scholar frien in Sanger this last trip down the Valley. He was born in Ispahan, in Persia, and is
descended from a group of Armenians who were ordered by the Shah to leave their homes and
colonize in Ispahan.... the Armenian name of this colony is Jurfi, or Jurfe. Jurfi was established in 1610
or there-abouts by this arbitrary command of the Shah of Persia. Armenians don't marry into other
races much, so although they were born in Persia, Mr. Galoostian and his wife remain Armenian.
They moved to Calcutta after they grew up, and he taught in a famous Armenian school there for
many years. He speaks persian, Armenian,[?] Hindustai, Turkish and Arabian; all these fluently---
and he reads them plus three or four dialects as well. His library is full of beautifully hand-written
volumes, some of them illuminated --- Persian, Arabian, etc. It seems that Persian cannot be printed
because it is a form of shorthand which changes according to the syllabic context; but some of his
Persian books seem to have been mimeographeed by the gelatine-offset process --- which means
very small editions of course.Mr. Galoostian told me a number of interesting things -- among others,
he says only two Armenian families [?] have come to the U.S. from Persia in the past 30-40 years,
although a number of single men have come. He spells his Armenian name in the Persian fashion; a
Turkish Armenian would spell his Kalustian, and I know a family of that name in Fowler, incidentally.
They sound alike, of course...Speaking of mathematics, Mr. Galoostian told me that Hindus are
wonderfully gifted by nature in math.... He told me you can take any guttersnipe in the street and
ask him to multiply 1 3/7 by 11 6/13 and the youngster would give you the right answer at once,
as if the matter as immediate and direct a perception as our recognition of color or of 2 plus 2.
Moreover, the Hindu mathematical system has names for all these unusual fractions which include
implications about the chracter of each, --- just as we have a number of supplementary ideas about
the fraction 1/2 --- we understand immediately its relationships with related numbers - 1, 1/4, 1/8,
3/6, 4/8, etc. the Hindu carries all this much further, and grasp it for courious items like 7 3/22 and
168 8/11. Moreover he has a series of names, of work of memoria technica such as Fox-Strangways
mentions for raga, for all these fractions and innumerable others. Fox-Strangways rage a remark
that amused me, as it is so well illustrated by all the rather infrequent dealings I've had with Hindus:
He said the E Indian loves to classify and name all conceivable variations of rhythms, scale, mode,
etc.; but it bothered him not at all that only one out of 20 of the lot were ever put into actual use.
AFCCC-COR3-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-2
It is the Platonic notion of the existence of ideals in the abstract somewhere. The Hindu seems to
enjoy feeling that all these extra possibilities may be attained by reaching out his hand --- though
he never bothers to make the effect, actually.The last time I was at Sanger Mr. Galoostian showed
me reams and reams of 'literature --- poems in the Spencerian stanza; novelli of 55,000 words, vary
Oriental and long-drawn-out, and prodigiously unintersting, to me, as he had some English bits
about the Armenian ritual and Armenian folk music that I wanted to read. He is more intelligent than
the classic E. Indian 'Babu' immortalized by Rudyard Kipling; but has? he writes in rather the same
way --- glorious long words, used in almost?], but not quite, the right places. One line I remember
was about the nightingale. "Which snuggled all alert upon the limpid branch." This time when he
asked me if I liked poetry I said "Not much," because my time is too limited to get tangled up in his
efforts to find a published, which is what he showed signs of asking me to do, last time. He remarked
in another connection that his impulse, upon finding a friend, was to "turn himself inside out" ---
and although I enjoy the Galoosians, I find their interest in telling me all about themselves and
inquiring all about me a trifle wearing. Their chief use to me is in general Armenian information ---
they know nothing about music. I can't make out whether their complete lack of reserve is due to
normal Oriental manners or whether they are simply overwhelmed with pleasurable excitement at
making a `white' friend. 4 They got onto the subject of Armenian jokes, and showed me a collection
of jokes translated into English, all centered about the experiences of a single comic character as
our Little Audrey jokes are. The humor seems childishly obvious at first but there were usually subtle
ramifications. The ones I remember particularly ran like this:
Mr. X-- had occasion to borrow some cooking utensils, pots and pans, from a neighbor. When he
returned them, he sent along a lot of small ones of his own. "What is this?" said the neighbor. "These
small things are not mine." "Oh yes, [?] they belong to you," said Mr. X. "Your big kettles and pots,
thrown together here as they were, mated and bore young." "A funny thing!" grumbled the neighbor.
And he kept the small utensils along with his own.
Later on Mr. X.. borrowed even more pots and pans than before, and of course the neighbor was
only too glad to oblige him. When, however, after some weeks they had not been returned, the
neighbor, meeting Mr. X-- over the back fence, ventured to inquire about them. "Oh," said Mr. X. 'It's
a great shame, but I can't return them." "Whyever not?" said the neighbor, astonished at X--'s sad
mien. "Well, you see," said Mr. X-- with the air of a man breaking bad news, "They all died." "Died!"
said the owner of the utensils indignantly. "What nonsnse! How can tin saucepans and iron pots
die?" "If they can mate and bear young, they can be expected to die one day, assuredly." To the
neighbor's protests, Mr. X-- was only to glad to point out that since his neighbor had accepted the
idea of human characteristics for his metal utensils [?] when he accepted the small pieces of tinware
in the first place,[?] it was now too late to claim replacement on different grounds....

This is the one they all thought most hilariously funny: A man and his wife were distressed not to
be invited to the celebration attendant upon a wedding in a friend's house, since they too enjoyed
feasting and dancing "I'll tell you what," said the husband, "I'll pretend to beat you furiously, you
run off to our good neighbor and beg him to protect you; then I'll come running after. To create a
pleasant atmosphere and divert my attention, he can hardly refuse to invite us in to share in the
good things.... that's only good manners."
The joke here lies not in the obvious trick upon the neighbor, but in the use of bad manners -- (the
beating) to claim [?] an invitation which can be depended upon an inevitable because it is good
manners. Our western form of the same joke runs this way:
A gentleman in London was late for a dinner party, and arrived much fussed and all out of breath,
having mussed his tie, mislaid a cufflink, had difficulty finding a taxi, etc.,etc. He arrived, happily, in
time but breathless, and was pleased to find his partner at dinner an attractive and distinguished
person --- I believe this is a diplomatic corps story, as I remember --- It was some time before he
retrieved his lost poise, and as the butler offered him a large bowl of very gooey salad, his partner
was astonished to see him reach out, take a good fistful of the things in the dish and [?] put it on
his plate without benefit of serving fork an spoon. The glazed expression of this well-mannered
lady called his attention to what he'd done; and he laughed nervously and said apologetically: "How
absurd of me to be so absent minded. You knew, really, I thought he was offering me spinach!"It
seems that this book of jokes is so well known to every Armenian (It was printed in Turkish originally,
but the stories are very old, and are continually added too--) that when in a group of Armenians
you tell one, someone else caps that with another, and a third guest adds a third, and so on. The
frequency with which the stories are told, their wide familiarity,[?] is a recommendation, in the
Oriental view.Yes, I'll write Grainger but I should think he'd rather hear from you than from me. Chris
Fredericks arranged to go see you one morning last week, but she had to send a message breaking
the engagement because her aunt, with whom she lives, had a fainting spell" ---Do you remember
my suggesting to you, a long time ago, what you really ought to concoct a course in rhythm for
students? You had your book on rhythm in mind then and were n't interested; but I still think it
should be done and that you're the only person who could do it. I'll write more about this another
time.... As ever.
70 Avon Way, San FranciscoOctober 12, 1938
Dr. Harold SpivackeChief, Music DivisionLibrary of CongressWashington, D.C.Dear Dr. Spivacke:The
project here moves on snail-wise and has not formally opened  yet!  It is now almost 3 1/2 months
AFCCC-COR3-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-2
since it was okehed in Washington, and we are still " expecting to get to work any day. " Because our
non-labor funds come from the State Relief Administration, which offered $7.50 per man-month
to WPA projects having difficulty in raising th necessary non-labor funds to operate, our lease on
projects project quarters has had to go through a series of legal hands -- and the delays at this point
have been only one of several.However, I continue to pursue music, and as San Francisco and the
peninsula is full of it, I'm finding all sorts of things. The American singers I know, however, with
one exception, are all too far for me at present until travel funds are available. The one exception,
however, is a fine old boy whose letter addressed to "Gov't bueaua callecting songs" was forwarded
to me from Washington. He turns out to be something of a find in terms of quantity and variety,
though his singing voice leaves something to be desired. He knows ten or twelve Child ballads
anyway, several songs sung by the 49ers, a lot of amusing songs with the very British nonsense
refrains, and a lot of songs about local events of 20-50 years ago. He sang for us for 5 solid hours,
30-40 songs anyway, and showed me a lot of ms. he'd written out, in addition. His spelling is the
most consistently original I've ever come across, incidentally-- only by accident does he seem to get a
word right. He is the only singer of this type that I know who has spent almost all his life in California
--- he came here at the age of five or six. He knows a few fidd. fiddle tunes also.So: I propose working
away with him, a little at a time, and since as you can see he can fill 20-30 records easily, I would
appreciate your sending me some more records. The express company is warned now, so the above
address should work without difficulty.If you have some policy about "foreign" groups' music, I wish
you would define it for me. I don't know just how to plan , in recording for you before the project
start. From the point of view of the University of California, they seem to want material illustrative
of everything to be foun here as of the year 1938. This entails, to take just one example , mediocre
performances of mediocre Japanese music which can be better illustrated by records made in Japan
and on sale here now. Of course this is of interest, 2 but this music is influenced by Occidental music
without having much influence here in return, and it seems more likely to die out abruptly than to
be amalgamated, so to speak, and kept alive in an attenuated form here. There is no interchange
between Jap. & Am. folk music; popular, [?] Japan; [composers:?] A. [?] J. Assuming for the moment
that the project is suspended indefinitely, and that I record for you as I can, it seems to me that
your records should include  anything in the English language which can be shown to be related to
traditional music; but that foreign material should can only be recorded when it is of exceptional
quality and would otherwise be lost; or when it is somehow related to America. There are plenty of
Japanese commercial records showing the effect of jazz on folk and popular music in Japan, easily
availale in San Francisco. Also there are good records of very fine traditional Japanese music. So,
except from the historical point of view in the state here, I do not see much point in recording this
sort of thing, much as I enjoy doing it. What do you think?On the other hand, when it comes to things
like the records of the Kalevala that I made in Minnesota, or the chanting of the Eddas among the
AFCCC-COR3-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-2
Icelanders that I want to do here: If these have been recorded at all, it is by the Finnish or Icelandic
governments, andit would be extremely complicated to make the records available here.
They do not drink, smoke, dance ---- & speak almost no English. The men working in
shipyards, women in lanndries and have Russian steam baths in their yards, on the Potrero
hill south of mkt. Market St. with a marvelous view of the city! Fron thier baths.
In particular I have one most interesting group on my mind here: the Russians of the Molokan
Church. I recorded one of their services, 10 records or so, for you. Although the records are
interesting and impressive, it is hard to follow the parts, so, I persuaded two couples to record
another six records, which are stunning and several other small groups have offered to record
more if they may have copies. I don't usually do this, it is such a nuisance; but in this case the music
is so extraordinary that I've told them I will record for any who want records if they will pay for
the blanks. I could easily make another 20 records. They have been separate from the Russian
Orthodox Church for around 200 years, and they are rather like our Puritans, or the Quakers. They
sing unaccompanied, in a sort of free polyphony above a cantus firmus which results in parallel 7ths;
they think nothing of starting the second voice a 9th above the cantus. It sounds so like Stravinsky,
I cannot believe he has not heard music of this sort. The group came here in 1905 from a place that
sounds like Salyeem and is spelled Salem, near Mt. Ararat in what is now Soviet Armenia. Some
of them learned a little Armenian but they have never intermarried out of their Russian group. I
think they were sent south of the Caucausus by Catherine the Great; but it is difficult to make sure
because they can only tell me they were 'led by God', and they believe their tunes were composed
by Sts. Paul, Peter, and King David! They seem to have different tunes or all the familiar passages of
the Old and New Testaments, and they can tell you instantly the chapter and verse for any quotation
you can think of. Their service consists almost entirely of singing and reading, with brief comments
'from the heart', of passages from the Bible. They have special 'psalms' as they call them all, for
burials, weddings, Easter, Christmas; I've spent two hours Sunday morning ? almost as much Sunday
evening, with / them, for the past month. They will record anything I ask; but I have rather held back,
not knowing 3 how important this sort of thing is in your scheme of things.As soon as I've finished
up the 25 records you sent me, I'll send the whole batch in to you, and you can judge. Can you agree
to make copies there, however, for the University of California, if they want them and can provide
blanks? Otherwise I should have copies made here before returning them to you. I will try to fill up
the remainder of this first 25 with American songs.What with one thing and another, it is difficult
to avoid playing the records I make two or three times before returning them to you. Should I use
the Presto hardening liquid on the French records you sent?Charlie Seeger wrote the other day to
inquire whether I would come back onto his staff if he could arrange it -- to do much the same job
with folk music that Lindeman suggested --- stir up state projects everywhere. Rather dubiously, I
said Iw ould. I don't know how immediate this is, but it puts me back in the same unsettled state
I was a few weeks ago; at this rate the project here may never open, if the WPA insists on making
AFCCC-COR3-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-2
it depend upon my availability, since there is a chance the job in Washington will become definite
before this does. Of course this is confidential... it won't surprise me if this does n't materialize
either. I mention it to explain why I continue to request records instead of waiting for the California
project to start....What has become of Alan? My correspondents in Wisconsin had seen nothing
of him by the 10th or so of September. Of course he may yet arrive in Crandon. I asked him for a
forwarding address to which I could send some more definite names and addresses; but have not
heard from him.Please don't get the impression that there are no ' american American ' singers
in California; I have heard of several along the west slope of the Sierra, but have not been able to
get up there. My reports have been rather over-weighted with talk about my lovely 'racial minority
groups' because I am near the industrial and agricultural regions of the state. I'm perfectly sure there
are plenty of slightly younger Dusenberrys around. So far I only know of two singers of songs which
belong to the pre-American history of California, and I am going to have to spend two or three days
with each of them before we can get around to recording --- probably, They are perfectly willing to
sing me the songs, and to record; but getting around to doing it is something else again -- tomorrow
surely will do just as well? There is one's siesta to think about, one man said to me seriously.Did
you ever hear from Percy Grainger? He seems to be in Australia now. But his permanent home is
certainly White Plains, and he'll be back. There was a man named James Madison Carpenter at Yale
last year who has a collection of cylinders made in England. I don't know a thing about him -- he may
have been a Professor or a student but more likely just a visitor; and he was looking rather helplessly
for a place to deposit his records. This was told me by a friend who got into casual conversation
with Dr. Carpenter on the train. I don't know whether there is the slightest chance of tracing him.
I gathered he wa vaguely displeased by whatever proposal Yale made him about his records --
Cordially yours, Sidney Robertson

Mrs. Sidney Robertson70 Avon WaySan Francisco, CaliforniaDear Mrs. Robertson: I am glad that you
are making records and should appreciate your sending me some of the discs as soon as possible,
although it will be better to have all duplicates made in California beforehand thereby relieving us of
this part of the task. We have no objection to foreign language groups. In fact Alan Lomax has been
doing some of this work in Michigan. I shall send you twenty-five more discs in the near future but
please send me some of the recorded work as soon as possible.
Alan Lomax had so much to do in Michigan that he may not be able to record in Wisconsin on this
trip.
AFCCC-COR3-2 http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc1940001.afc1940001_cor3-2
I never heard from Percy Grainger.
I agree with you that you had better continue recording in California until something else
materializes. Do not forget the American songs because we have no such material from this state.
With kindest regards,Sincerely,Harold SpivackeChief, Division of MusicHSmr
