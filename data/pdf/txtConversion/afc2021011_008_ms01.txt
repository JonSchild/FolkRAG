SPEAKERS
Steve Marko, Jared Schmidt
Jared Schmidt 00:01
Great. All right, this is Jared Schmidt. It is Wednesday, December 22, 2021. And I am sitting
with Steve Marko, uh, I said your name, your last name, correct?
Steve Marko 00:14
That's correct.
Jared Schmidt 00:15
Great. And, Steve, I want to make sure we, before we begin that I have your consent to record
the interview.
Steve Marko 00:21
Yes, you do.
Jared Schmidt 00:22
Great. Well, thank you, Steve, for joining me this really rainy Wednesday morning via the
internet. I appreciate it.
Steve Marko 00:31
Welcome to the coast of Oregon, for sure.

Jared Schmidt 00:33
Right. It is almost Christmas and it does not look like it outside.
Steve Marko 00:37
[Laughs]
Jared Schmidt 00:39
I've not seen a white Christmas out here yet. Which is weird to me.
Steve Marko 00:45
All this green means lots of, plenty of water and plenty of fresh grass and everything else. So,
it's it's good for us.
Jared Schmidt 00:51
And plenty of cheese, then, after that, right?
Steve Marko 00:53
Absolutely. For sure.
Jared Schmidt 00:55
I like it. Well, Steve, I was wondering if you wouldn't mind introducing yourself. You know, what
year you were born, where you're from, educational background, and things of that nature.
Steve Marko 01:06
Sure thing. So, I'm Steve Marko. I was originally born in Elgin, Illinois, but my family moved to
Southern California. I was born in 1972. As I grew up in Southern California, all I really knew
was I, of course, wanted to go to college, but I had no idea of career where I'd go. I wanted to
stay at the coast and surf like most Southern Californians. I ended up and, at a agricultural
school called Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. And there, I thought, I just started to study pre-med,
biochemistry is my undergraduate degree. But we started a small smoothie chain when I was in
college, and I kind of just fell in love with food, abandoned the, abandoned the direction of
taking my MCATs. They asked me if I'd like to come aboard and build, they were going to turn
this into a corporation, and if I would head up R&D, I was the only person to do any kind of
science. I didn't know anything about food science.
S
S
S
S
Jared Schmidt 02:08
Hmm.
Steve Marko 02:08
I was biochemist. But, this little smoothie company grew into this company called Jamba Juice.
And so, I ended up running Research and Development for Jamba Juice for almost ten years.
And that's where I realized, "Oh, this is why people, maybe, go to school and learn this degree
called Food Science," which I didn't have. So, I went back and got my master's degrees at
Fresno State in California, and I got a, I got a master's in food science, as well as a master's in
viticulture, or not viticulture, but enology. So, really, the study of winemaking. I had a passion
for winemaking, but, I soon realized that the jumpstart of my career was probably going to pull
me back to food where I had more of an expertise. And so, I went back into the food career,
and eventually, found my way up to Portland, Oregon, area
Jared Schmidt 03:04
Mhm.
Steve Marko 03:04
where I got to know this brand, Tillamook and just fell in love with the brand Tillamook. And,
and slowly found my way in, knocked on the door every time, chance I got, and I'm now I'm the
Senior Director of R&D for Tillamook.
Jared Schmidt 03:18
That is a journey and a half.
Steve Marko 03:21
Yeah, it's been fun. I'm really lucky and blessed. And food is a lot of fun.
Jared Schmidt 03:26
Yeah. So wait. So, you said you, you worked for a smoothie chain that, what, became Jamba
Juice?
Steve Marko 03:32
That's correct. Yeah. Yeah, we started this little company, we created it called Juice Club. It
S
S
S
S
That's correct. Yeah. Yeah, we started this little company, we created it called Juice Club. It
happened on the campus just outside of the campus of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. And it was
about natural smoothies and juices. And we evolved into a franchise and built stores across the
country. And so, when I left, we were store one when I started and when we left we were about
400 stores. So, a pretty exciting career. Yeah, just lucky.
Jared Schmidt 03:58
That is amazing. I mean, I've, I have been to Jamba Juice in rural Minnesota, that's...
Steve Marko 04:04
Yeah, many of those smoothies I probably created for you.
Jared Schmidt 04:08
Oh, thank you for the peanut butter ones. [Both laugh]
Steve Marko 04:11
You're welcome.
Jared Schmidt 04:13
That's amazing. So, what year, then, did you, you move to Portland, and what year was it?
Steve Marko 04:20
So, we moved to Portland, I believe it was in 2006.
Jared Schmidt 04:24
Okay.
Steve Marko 04:25
Yeah. Summer of 2006. My, my wife, at that time, we both decided we fell in love with the
Portland area. We just wanted to live in the northwest. I was even willing to change my career if
I needed to just to, the draw to the northwest was just really within us. We both quit our jobs
and we moved, without work, came to the Northwest. Unfortunately I was hired right away and,
not at Tillamook yet, I'd started at another natural food brand. But uh, we're both thankfully
employed and we, we love the Northwester This is home.
S
S
S
S
Jared Schmidt 05:02
Yeah, I definitely understand that as it rains. So, what you said, you mentioned earlier that you
fell in love with the Tillamook brand. What about it made you fall in love with the brand? And it
was around that same time? Correct, around 2006?
Steve Marko 05:20
Yeah, yeah. So, I've always grown up with more natural brands, at least my career has taken
me towards natural foods, whether they have an organic label or not, just to, they're just not
artificially or synthetically made. And, because I don't belong in that career, that's just not
where I want to be. I want, I wanted, I like foods that are tied to the land and the agriculture.
We call it real food. And, so, I like to cook, I like to cook with those things. And, when I, when I
found the Tillamook cheese, the Tillamook ice cream, the Tillamook yogurt that's so prevalent
here in our local stores at that time, it was a brand that I knew that I'd like to work for, just
because of the, the quality and creaminess of the products. And the fact that they don't just
make one thing. They make multiple products across the entire dairy category, that excites me.
So, I like working on lots of different things.
Jared Schmidt 06:18
Okay, so, it's the fact that it's not just cheddar, it's the ice cream, the ice cream sandwiches,
the whole...
Steve Marko 06:25
Yogurt.
Jared Schmidt 06:26
Yogurt.
Steve Marko 06:26
And sour cream, now cream cheese. Yeah, a little bit of everything.
Jared Schmidt 06:32
Nice. And then you started knocking on Tillamook's door around that time. Could you talk about
how you got into the the position you are now? Mhm.
S
S
S
Steve Marko 06:40
And, unfortunately, my wife has a job in the urban Portland area. Yeah, I would say, you know,
for younger, for younger people starting their career, networks are everything, right? And so, I
have met so many people along the way. And, quite frankly, quite a few people from this small
company called Pacific Foods where I was working, had departed. And they, some of them, had
found their way into Tillamook. So, I'd kept in touch, and I had, I had talked to several people
that worked for Tillamook, and they used to work with me.
Jared Schmidt 06:54
Mhm.
Steve Marko 07:02
So, for me to move to the coast of Tillamook was not, was not really an option for my family.
When Tillamook decided they were going to build an outpost,
Jared Schmidt 07:23
Mhm.
Steve Marko 07:23
an office in downtown Portland. That's when my, my connections and network called and said,
"Hey, we're building something in downtown Portland. Would you want to come, come join us?"
And, absolutely, I jumped on board right away.
Jared Schmidt 07:37
Okay. So you're based in Portland, then?
Steve Marko 07:39
So I am based in Portland.
Jared Schmidt 07:40
Okay.
Steve Marko 07:40
S
S
S
S
S
Steve Marko 07:40
And I commute where I need to be. But most of my work can be done from the Portland area.
Jared Schmidt 07:45
Mhm.
Steve Marko 07:46
But I'm down in Tillamook quite often.
Jared Schmidt 07:48
Okay, so we might see you at the gift store every now and then?
Steve Marko 07:51
Absolutely. I love the gift store.
Jared Schmidt 07:52
I do, too. I like to go in and just meander. It's pretty fun.
Steve Marko 07:56
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 07:56
Okay. And then, so your position is currently Senior Director of Research and Development. Is
that correct?
Steve Marko 08:03
That's correct. Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 08:04
How would you explain your job to somebody who's not familiar with what you do?
S
S
S
S
Steve Marko 08:12
Yeah. I would say the job's, from a Tillamook standpoint, the job has evolved.
Jared Schmidt 08:18
Mhm.
Steve Marko 08:19
This might be a very ordinary, normal position for any other food company. Research and
development might be researching new technologies and finding new ways to create new foods
out of something that had never existed. At Tillamook, it's really about the idea of how do we
grow our brand and our products. And so, we're really a product development team. And so,
we're looking at how can we take this great resource of dairy
Jared Schmidt 08:48
Mhm.
Steve Marko 08:48
and evolve it into new products, and commercialize them, and make them stand for the
premium,and quality, and the things that we want. So really, I'm a product developer, so I
pretty much formulate new products. We also have a packaging component to our team that
creates the new structures, maybe looks at new architect designs of cups, and film, and
sustainability. So that all exists within our research and development team. So we're the
commercialization side of the new products.
Jared Schmidt 09:20
Oh, really? Okay. Do you have any particular products that, maybe you are, maybe most proud
of that you can talk about that you've been at the helm of, or?
Steve Marko 09:22
Yeah. I mean, I think right now, the most exciting thing we've done is cream cheese. There's
really been one dominant brand in the marketplace for so long of cream cheese, that, I think,
this new cream cheese that we brought, it's really not new and it's not that novel. It's just
better quality and the amount of real ingredients that we put into making what should have
been cream cheese all along. If you get the chance to try the difference, it will blow you away.
Jared Schmidt 10:03
S
S
S
S
Jared Schmidt 10:03
I have. I, I was on a bagel kick a couple months ago.
Steve Marko 10:07
[Laughs]
Jared Schmidt 10:07
And I did buy the Tillamook Cream Cheese. And, I must say, objectively, it was very good.
Steve Marko 10:14
Yeah, it's really fun to have people try it. Because, sometimes, you don't know what you're
missing. Sometimes in our food source, we don't know what we're missing until we, someone
has a chance to point it out. And, so, kind of being complacent with what's available in the
market, and trying something that should have been the type of cream cheese that could be
out there in the market today.
Jared Schmidt 10:36
Mkay.
Steve Marko 10:37
It's pretty exciting. It's fun to watch people's eyes light up.
Jared Schmidt 10:39
Would you say that's probably one of the best parts of your job then is, is that, that light up
their eyes and maybe finding new avenues, or?
Steve Marko 10:48
Quite honestly, I mean, the best part of my job is I get to eat great food every day.
Jared Schmidt 10:52
That's awesome. So, keep with that cream cheese aspect, how do you, or any other product,
how do you go about that stages of developing a new product and putting it out into the
market? What's the step by step of that like? [Laughs]
S
S
S
S
Steve Marko 10:52
I'm not gonna lie, it's, you know, I mean, it's just, I'm one of the luckiest people, I really am. I
get to taste just amazing products. But I really enjoy answering questions and running into
people at social gatherings that are just telling me how much they love Tillamook products. And
they want to know more about how it's made and what's in it and how it's done. And it's just,
it's, it's fun to have conversations about all that. Yeah, I'd say from the, from the brand and
marketing side of view. So we take, we take a very consumer centric position. So we really, we
listen to the consumers. We also listen to our customers, so our grocery outlet stores that
we're, that we need to market our products at. And we look for places where it really makes
sense. What are the pain points that consumers are saying? What are they looking for in their
food? What are they missing? And so we listen to that, and that drives the innovation of where
we would go. And so, then my team will then look at and say, let's take cream cheese, for
example, "We know we recognize that there is a place that people really want a better quality,
better tasting cream cheese. Can we do it?" And so then my team will set out and say, "Okay,
let's look at formulas, let's figure out, what would it take to make a better cream cheese? Is it,
is it really great proprietary cultures to, to culture, the milk? Is it increasing the fat because the
creaminess of cream cheese is missing? Is it removing all the gums and stabilizers that fill up in
our additives and having no preservatives and no artificial colors? Or flavors?" That's how my,
so my team would go on that. And then we would look at, "Well, how can we package that?
What's the right package for the consumer to have? And what do they want? And how is it good
for the environment? And what ways can we, what ways can we bring something just better to
the world in that way?"
Jared Schmidt 12:02
Mkay.
Steve Marko 12:02
So...
Jared Schmidt 12:02
Mkay. So, you do all of it [Laughs].
Steve Marko 12:08
We do, yeah, yea.
Jared Schmidt 12:10
So the long and short of it is all of it.
S
S
S
Steve Marko 12:16
And then, and then we have to figure out how to manufacture.
Jared Schmidt 13:11
Okay.
Steve Marko 13:12
And, you know, we can't own every technology and every piece of manufacturing equipment, it
would just be too expensive. So we have great partners, and we help facilitate and find ways to
manufacture. If it's not even in our own building, how do we oversee that? How do we maintain
the quality? And how do we control that? So that, that all rests within my department.
Jared Schmidt 13:32
Okay, so are you the one to thank, then, for the ice cream sandwiches as well?
Steve Marko 13:38
[Laughs] We are yes.
Jared Schmidt 13:38
Thank you. So the caramel ones are my favorite. So thank you again for that.
Steve Marko 13:44
So glad you found them. Yeah, those are hard to find in stock right now this time.
Jared Schmidt 13:49
There's a reason for that. Those are my Achilles' heel. So, that is why I have to go to the gym
[Laughs].
Steve Marko 13:56
We are working on some new novel ideas that I can't share with you, yet, but more to come.
S
S
S
S
S
Jared Schmidt 14:02
That'll be it for a follow up interview, right?
Steve Marko 14:04
[Laughs]
Jared Schmidt 14:06
So, you mentioned, Mark,several times, or Steve, the idea and concept of sustainability, right?
Steve Marko 14:13
Yes.
Jared Schmidt 14:13
How, how do you wrestle and negotiate that within a product like cheese, especially when
there's a lot of plastic involved, too.?
Steve Marko 14:25
It is, and it's, it's challenging. I think, um, making the right decisions sometimes makes, means
some hard choices.
Jared Schmidt 14:33
Mhm.
Steve Marko 14:34
We are always looking at, is there a better way? Is there a better solution? Is there something
more sustainable? We have, we have performed something called lifecycle analysis. So LCA,
shortened. For the first time in years, my, my company has done two LCAs
Jared Schmidt 14:53
Mhm.
S
S
S
S
Steve Marko 14:53
to look at our packaging and say, "If we made some trade offs, if we chose to look at, if we
could find some plastic packaging that was more compostable or was more recyclable, how
would that affect the environment and the overall lifecycle of the entire product?" Because it's
not just greenhouse gases, it actually is, there's so much more complexity that goes into
sustainability.
Jared Schmidt 15:16
Mhm.
Steve Marko 15:16
What we found is, some of the trade offs don't actually make the product more sustainable.
Jared Schmidt 15:21
Hmm.
Steve Marko 15:22
In fact, I mean, today, 40% of food goes to waste in our country. And so, mix it with a global,
that's a global number. But in the United States, it's much less because we have much better
supply chain and refrigeration and all the elements. But, protecting the food against food
waste, many would say is the number one sustainable decision you must make to start with.
Jared Schmidt 15:47
Really? Mkay.
Steve Marko 15:48
And so, finding those trade-offs. So we know that having the least amount of plastic that might
be necessary to preserve the product without added preservatives, and make sure our product
survives shelflife and doesn't go to waste, is kind of our most important decision to make to
start with.
Jared Schmidt 16:07
Okay, that makes a lot of sense. Yeah. That, how does, how do you not waste food, And then
also apply...That, that sounds like a really complicated dance.
S
S
S
S
Steve Marko 16:17
It is, it is for sure. But technology is improving, and we're always looking at new ways of
working with municipalities. We're working with National Sustainable Coalition's, like, how can
we find ways to close the loop and make things more circular?
Jared Schmidt 16:34
Mhm.
Steve Marko 16:34
And bring it back? So, we just announced this year, sustainability goals that we're going after,
within 2025, and then beyond on how we're trying to achieve those things.
Jared Schmidt 16:44
Mkay. What is the relationship, then with sustainability with the farmers? How do you balance
that as well? Or is that part of your job, too?
Steve Marko 16:52
You know, it's it, it doesn't quite cross to my job, as well. We do have a stewardship team that
did farm stewardship that works directly with the farms and correlates those seams together.
But I can tell you, for sure, that the farmers tell me all the time that they're, they're so excited
about the new technologies, and what we're looking at sustainability, I know means everything
to our farms. They've been doing this for generations, so, sustainability in their lifestyle is just,
is a given. It's just what they do.
Jared Schmidt 17:19
Yeah.
Steve Marko 17:19
So, they're always looking for less water use, and things that help preserve the land and
everything else. So, um, the mindset is just, it just, it's a match made in heaven. It works
perfectly.
Jared Schmidt 17:31
Nice. That's exciting, really exciting. Especially, like they said, that it's the things you think
S
S
S
S
about as you go to the grocery store, or might just be absent minded, but it's glad that you're,
you're working behind the scenes to help consumers and the climate at the same time.
Steve Marko 17:48
Absolutely. And we, and we listened back, we hear from them, they provide us insight of what
they're looking for, and questions they have. And, I think the best thing that we have found is
being transparent.
Jared Schmidt 18:01
Right.
Steve Marko 18:01
And being honest. Would I love to get rid of every single bit of single use plastic? For sure.
Jared Schmidt 18:08
Mhm.
Steve Marko 18:08
But I would rather be honest with the consumer and say, "Look, I really want to bring you the
best quality food that doesn't go to waste. And I'll continue working on this, but I'm going to tell
you, you know, it's it's still a single use plastic, but it's the minimal amount we can possibly
use." And I think they appreciate that.
Jared Schmidt 18:26
Yeah, I mean, I, I know I do. Now that you say it, because I always feel like "Oh, no, that's so
much plastic!" But yeah, especially living at the ocean, like you worry about worry about the
turtles and the seals.
Steve Marko 18:40
For sure. Right. Exactly.
Jared Schmidt 18:41
Yeah. So, you mentioned earlier that, part of your everyday, consists of eating good food. I was
wondering if you could explain more about what your everyday looks like within research and
S
S
S
S
wondering if you could explain more about what your everyday looks like within research and
development?
Steve Marko 18:54
Yeah, so what right now ice cream is really popular.
Jared Schmidt 18:59
[Laughs]
Steve Marko 19:00
Ice cream is growing at an exponential rate. So, quite frankly, I could probably walk into the lab
today and the team is working on five new ice cream flavors. I could walk in and they might
have a spoon set aside and say, "Steve, try this new one. What do you think?" And I'll be like,
"Ah, this is a great day," right? So I'm just, we're working on ice cream, we're working on new
flavors of cream cheese, we're working...Sometimes we might have the newest release of our
makers reserve which could be in up to 10 years aged cheddar cheese, and so, we're, I'm
always finding new food as I walk in lab. So that's what I mean by every single day at the office
is just amazing food.
Jared Schmidt 19:43
That sounds like the worst thing ever.
Steve Marko 19:45
Right, yea.
Jared Schmidt 19:45
I'm so, I feel so bad for you, Steve.
Steve Marko 19:48
I will tell you it's very popular to, uh, maybe gain a little weight when you come join the
company because you do eat some really great stuff, but that's okay.
Jared Schmidt 19:56
How do you go about, you mentioned, like there's several new flavors of ice cream that you're
working on, right? As I'm thinking, as I'm asking you this, I'm thinking about what my freezer
S
S
S
S
working on, right? As I'm thinking, as I'm asking you this, I'm thinking about what my freezer
currently looks like, and we're out of the vanilla bean right now.
Steve Marko 20:07
Okay.
Jared Schmidt 20:08
What, how do you go about designing and developing new flavors, right? Is it based on what
the market is saying, or is it trends, or just the whim?
Steve Marko 20:18
It's quite a, quite frankly, what we have found, is, many of the trends start with the culinary
chefs in our country.
Jared Schmidt 20:26
Hmm.
Steve Marko 20:26
The restaurants and the culinary chefs, they're ahead of the trends. So we watch those flavors
that are coming out from, at very nice dining restaurants and things like that
Jared Schmidt 20:38
Mhm.
Steve Marko 20:38
Many of the flavor partners out there are looking at where trends are going. And then we're
asking consumers and customers to see what's, what we think is missing. And then, quite
frankly, we also have this innate, innovative spirit within our own team that just loves to create
and come up with things that they really enjoy. So when you bring all those together, we
probably have a lot of choices to make.
Jared Schmidt 21:01
Yeah.
S
S
S
S
Steve Marko 21:01
And then we put, then we'll put those together. And then we will, we'll bring in cross functional,
bring in the people from finance and people from marketing and people from IT. They all get to
join in
Jared Schmidt 21:13
Yeah.
Steve Marko 21:13
and weigh in on their opinion of what they think, and...Is it creamy enough? Should it have
more pieces of cookies, should it? Is it the right color?
Jared Schmidt 21:23
Yeah.
Steve Marko 21:24
All those things weigh in, yeah.
Jared Schmidt 21:26
Do you have a particular flavor that you could talk about the journey of and how that worked?
Or ice cream, or anything or? That you've been a part of that, that's on the market? That's not
secret right now?
Steve Marko 21:39
Yeah. I'm trying to think of, there's a really good one that secret I wish I could tell you at the
moment. You'll see. I think it really, here's a fun one. Right now,in the marketplace, you I think
you grew up in Minnesota, correct?
Jared Schmidt 21:52
Yeah, yeah.
Steve Marko 21:52
S
S
S
S
S
So, are you familiar with custard? Frozen custard?
Jared Schmidt 21:55
Yeah, I went to school in Wisconsin.
Steve Marko 21:57
Okay, frozen custard is not that popular out here on the West Coast of the United States.
Jared Schmidt 22:01
Right.
Steve Marko 22:02
We wanted to create the first premium pint size frozen custard.
Jared Schmidt 22:07
Ooh.
Steve Marko 22:08
And so, what we did, was we said, well, that would probably belong in a pint size, because it will
be expensive.
Jared Schmidt 22:14
Mhm.
Steve Marko 22:14
So what we did was we created a 16% butterfat, very high egg content, which, of course, as
you know, that's what differentiates custard, frozen custard from ice cream is a higher egg
content. And we created a Tillamook version of frozen custard. And we made almost, what we
styled, a farm-to-table inspired flavors.
Jared Schmidt 22:27
Right. Mhm.
S
S
S
S
Right. Mhm.
Steve Marko 22:38
And so they have a, a really, Oregon strawberry cheesecake, or a, we have a blackberry
cobbler coming out real soon. We have coffee and cocoa brought together, and these are all
really premium natural flavors that are just, I think, will excite people with a really high
butterfat. And so, to create something that was that unique, was a, was a fun journey, because
I don't think most people out here were really familiar with what a frozen custard would taste
like
Jared Schmidt 23:09
Right. Yeah, 'cuz I've seen the custard on the market or in the store. And people ask me, like,
oh, it's custard, and I get excited. And people ask about it. And I have to remember, "Oh, not
everyone has a Culvers nearby."
Steve Marko 23:22
Yeah, exactly.
Jared Schmidt 23:23
I moved it from Wisconsin, where Culvers is king.
Steve Marko 23:25
Exactly, where that was a quite a popular chain out there. Yes.
Jared Schmidt 23:28
Yeah. You, you drive by and it tells you what flavors of custard are available in that moment.
Steve Marko 23:33
Right.
Jared Schmidt 23:34
Yeah. Oh, that's exciting.
S
S
S
S
Steve Marko 23:35
So, the whole journey is creating the product, the flavor, creating the experience. And, like you
said, now I have to create an explanation with a package, and language, and communication to
the consumer and market so that people understand it and they want to buy it and they want
to continue to, continue to consume really great dairy products from us. So that's, that's, that's
part of a journey when you launch a brand new product.
Jared Schmidt 24:02
Yeah. How does that relate then with maybe the more standard cheeses, right, that Tillamook
has, like, the medium sharp cheddars.
Steve Marko 24:10
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 24:11
How do, how do you keep that, like, alive, I guess? I'm not quite sure what word might be best
for that, but, how do you continue it's
Steve Marko 24:20
Yeah!
Jared Schmidt 24:20
Yeah.
Steve Marko 24:21
Well, I think, fortunately, cheese is just the dominant, dominant product for us [Jared laughs]
and people, people pull and draw that from us. So we, we find that we don't have to push so
many new products, I like say, in that way. But! I'm not going to say cheddar, cheddar is not
exciting. Because the cheddar, what's going on with the cheddar, is, we make hundreds of
thousands of pounds of cheddar every day.
Jared Schmidt 24:48
Yeah.
S
S
S
S
Steve Marko 24:49
And they are in 40 pound blocks and they go to age and they sit, naturally aged, for anywhere
from sixty days to almost ten years.
Jared Schmidt 25:02
Yeah.
Steve Marko 25:02
So, we have options to go after. So what we're constantly doing is pulling different age
statements out from our age inventory, which is unique. We're one of the few people that have
the capacity to naturally age cheese at that kind of volume. And so we'll pull those cheeses out.
And we might say, let's bring a brand new, no one's ever seen an extra sharp sliced naturally
aged cheese, both maybe white or yellow, or maybe bringing out our habanero Jack. And so
those things we're constantly looking at, would people like to see it sliced? Do people need
smaller packages? Do we want to maybe bring them, bring some cut, maybe the club stores
are really getting popular at say, a Costco or a Sam's Club, where they want larger chunk styles
in displays. And so, we're always innovating in that way. Which maybe doesn't sound like as
much innovation to most folks out there.
Jared Schmidt 25:18
Mhm. Mhm.
Steve Marko 26:02
But it's, it's always changing and evolving the way the consumer is using it. Maybe it's a little
tweak to the package so that we improve the zipper closure so that we don't have any food
waste at all.
Jared Schmidt 26:14
Mhm.
Steve Marko 26:14
So we're always looking at changing those things. And they happen, sometimes they happen,
sight unseen, quietly, and sometimes we make a big splash about it.
Jared Schmidt 26:21
S
S
S
S
Nice. You said the phrase "age statement" a second ago.
Steve Marko 26:26
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 26:26
What does that meanm an age statement?
Steve Marko 26:28
You know, what's fun, is, a lot of people maybe don't know this about cheddar cheese. We hear
terms like medium, mild, sharp, extra sharp.
Jared Schmidt 26:39
Mhm.
Steve Marko 26:39
What do those mean? Well, quite frankly, there is no standard.
Jared Schmidt 26:43
Hmm.
Steve Marko 26:44
So, anyone can define and say, "I think this is sharp" and decided to stamp sharp on it.
Jared Schmidt 26:50
Mkay.
Steve Marko 26:51
So, at Tillamook, we didn't like that. So what we said, was, we're going to put an age to each of
our cheeses to standardize it for who we are.
S
S
S
S
S
Jared Schmidt 27:01
Hmm.
Steve Marko 27:01
And so what we said, was, since we are not fully pasteurized cheddar, we must hold it for at
least 60 days, that's required by the USDA requirement.
Jared Schmidt 27:12
Mkay.
Steve Marko 27:13
So we hold it for 60 days, we then test every single batch we've ever made. And we make sure
that it meets our quality, and it's up to our brand standards that we want to sell. Then we
decide, should this be sold between 60 days and nine months?
Jared Schmidt 27:29
Mhm.
Steve Marko 27:29
Anything within that age range is called medium.
Jared Schmidt 27:33
Mkay.
Steve Marko 27:34
Anything older than nine months, but less than 15 months, it's sharp. And anything older than
15 months is extra sharp.
Jared Schmidt 27:45
Huh!
S
S
S
S
Steve Marko 27:45
And then we get into our Reserve Series, where we actually put the date when the cheese was
made.
Jared Schmidt 27:52
Mhm.
Steve Marko 27:52
Almost like, you maybe have heard of, like a born on date, right?
Jared Schmidt 27:55
Right.
Steve Marko 27:55
So, we have a Makers Reserve Program where we have cheeses that might be stamped 2012.
Well, this year is, is we're in 2021, soon to be 2022.
Jared Schmidt 28:06
Mhm.
Steve Marko 28:07
So that product, in 2022, the product that is stamped 2012 will be ten years old, it was made
ten years ago.
Jared Schmidt 28:14
Okay. And it's just been aging.
Steve Marko 28:16
And it has been aging, in the cellar, for ten years, before we cut it. And it's, it's like no other
cheese you've ever had.
S
S
S
S
S
Jared Schmidt 28:22
Okay. Well I'm ready for my, to add that to my Christmas list then.
Steve Marko 28:30
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 28:31
That's, I did not know that that was the the logic behind the medium, mild, sharp was aging.
Steve Marko 28:38
Yeah. And you can go to any other cheese maker in our country, and they all might have
different standards of what they think.
Jared Schmidt 28:44
Right.
Steve Marko 28:44
So, where you grew up, sharp might have a little different flavor profile, because that cheese
maker chose to, to qualify that chees's sharp versus something else.
Jared Schmidt 28:55
Okay, that makes more sense. Okay, that's interesting that there's no standard and you all set
this as your personal like...
Steve Marko 29:03
Yeah, this is our personal standard based on what we have, what we have found, given our
aging temperatures, our cellar conditions, the way we know our cheese performs, and how we
age that and what we believe we want that flavor to be.
Jared Schmidt 29:18
Okay. That's fascinating. That's super cool.
S
S
S
S
Steve Marko 29:21
Yeah!
Jared Schmidt 29:22
That makes my shopping a little bit more easier, too [Laughs], knowing that.
Steve Marko 29:25
It does, it does, just once you see exactly what you know, you like.
Jared Schmidt 29:28
Mhm.
Steve Marko 29:29
You know, and whether, and, the yellow and white myth, you know. There's yellow cheese, and
there's white cheese, and they are the same cheese, just without the annatto color.
Jared Schmidt 29:41
Really?
Steve Marko 29:43
Yeah, so annatto is just a colorant from a seed from the from the Achiote tree.
Jared Schmidt 29:49
Mkay.
Steve Marko 29:49
And so, it is, it's a natural seed and it creates a natural color dye, the yellow-orange.
Jared Schmidt 29:55
Mhm.
S
S
S
S
S
Steve Marko 29:56
And for centuries people have added it to cheese to make it yellow-orange.
Jared Schmidt 30:00
Hmm.
Steve Marko 30:02
Some consumers just feel cheddar should be yellow, and so they buy the yellow.
Jared Schmidt 30:05
Mhm.
Steve Marko 30:06
Some consumers like the white color cheese, for whatever reason, but they are the same
recipe. They could be the same age, the same flavor. The only difference is the color.
Jared Schmidt 30:17
I did not know that. That's...
Steve Marko 30:19
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 30:19
Okay. Because I've often wondered, what's the situation, especially coming from Madison,
Wisconsin, where there's cheese curds, more than, you know, than anything else
Steve Marko 30:29
Exactly.
Jared Schmidt 30:30
S
S
S
S
S
Jared Schmidt 30:30
how that works. That's interesting. Huh. I'm just kind of in the moment of revelry right here and
realization.
Steve Marko 30:37
Yeah. What do you find out here in Oregon and the Pacific Northwest is more of the palate
preference? And it tends to see what we find in different areas of the market. Maybe the East
Coast tends to be leaning more towards white cheese and the West Coast might be more
yellow, and, it's just sort of the nature of what you grew up with. I think, what we hear, and this
is just anecdotal stories from people is, they identify Tillamook as the yellow-orange. That is
like our, that is our brand color. They just, they know the Tillamook orange. But! They think we
reserved, older cheeses should always be white. Its just, it's just the way it's been. It's what
they think and I'll make it all for them.
Jared Schmidt 31:02
Right. I can't help but fall into the same...I can't help but think, "Yeah, that's exactly what I
would have said as well."
Steve Marko 31:28
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 31:28
White is aged and Tillamook is orange. I fell into the same trap [Laughs]. I will have to find
those. Well, that leads me into my next question, then, is what makes this Oregon's cheese,
maybe, and Tillamook's cheese, particularly, stand out amongst other cheese making cultures
around the country, and
Steve Marko 31:34
Yeah, and we make both. We make, we make both for all of those reasons and above. But we
have very old aged yellow cheeses the taste just outstanding. Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 32:03
profile and, you know, what makes it so, what makes it unique?
Steve Marko 32:07
Yeah, I think, I think the unique cheese, for us, is really. What started, because it started in
Tillamook with the terroir of the local of, just, the cows, the feed, the grass, and everything that
S
S
S
S
Tillamook with the terroir of the local of, just, the cows, the feed, the grass, and everything that
has to do with the area. The natural culture environment, the way cheeses made in the plant.
But what we've really standardized it, even as we've had to make cheese in other locations
other than Tillamook, is the way we make cheese. So, we have, we target the higher fat
content above the standard of identity that needs to be in cheese. There's also a standard, by
regulatory, of what, how much moisture can be in your cheese.
Jared Schmidt 32:32
Mhm. Mhm.
Steve Marko 32:44
People can make cheese up to 39% moisture, which makes the cheese a little heavier and you
get more poundage. We are drastically lower in moisture. So, I think when you taste our
cheese, it just tastes much more intense than most cheeses you find on the market. And that's
because it's more cheese, there's less moisture, there's higher fat, the care for the the cows,
the animal care that we spend taking care of our cows produces better quality milk, which
produces better quality cheese which just goes all the way down the line. And then we're one of
the few that naturally age. No artificial enzymes added to speed up the aging. It's just time.
Jared Schmidt 33:24
Right. Okay.
Steve Marko 33:25
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 33:26
That's super cool. So then, with the creamery, you mentioning a bit ago, you mentioned
sustainability earlier and the fact that is, you know, rooted here with the terroir aspect. Why, or
what impact do you think this Creamery has had on, on Tillamook the county and, you know,
now that you're in Portland as well, on, on the identity of this, this part of the area?
Steve Marko 33:50
Yeah, well, I mean, it definitely starts, I'm sure you've heard the history of...Tillamook County
was founded to be a dairy, dairy land and it's, and it's, it's landlocked by the mountains, the
coastal mountains. And so, the dairies that formed to, to milk their cows didn't have any place
to send their milk.
S
S
S
Jared Schmidt 34:10
Mkay.
Steve Marko 34:10
Because at that time, they couldn't get the milk over the roads, over the mountains to 2000
foot elevation to come over into Portland. So sailing around and up the Columbia they used,
what we call, the Morningstar, hence the reason we have the ship on our, on our logo. And so, I
think building the cheese plant for Tillamook has allowed the farming generation of the entire
Tillamook County to preserve their way of life, their farming land, and so for generations now,
they've been able to hand over the farm down to their next generation and their kids. And it is
completely sustained the entire town and, and community of Tillamook.
Jared Schmidt 34:49
Mhm.
Steve Marko 34:49
Moving to Portland, now, with Portland being such a draw of really smart, enthusiastic people
surrounded about premium food and quality and natural food. It was just an obvious choice to
build an outpost office for folks that really wanted to be a part of Tillamook and live in the
Portland area. So now we're finding, we thought we would fill that office in, in five years.
Jared Schmidt 35:01
Mhm. Mhm.
Steve Marko 35:15
And we filled, we overfilled the office in six months.
Jared Schmidt 35:18
Wow.
Steve Marko 35:20
Yeah. So, I mean, we've, we've built jobs. Since I've joined in three and a half years, we have
doubled the size of the workforce of the entire company.
S
S
S
S
Jared Schmidt 35:29
Of Tillamook, the creamery and...
Steve Marko 35:31
Of the entire Tillamook company. Yeah, both at the Tillamook area, as well as in Portland, as
well as, and other local areas around the country that maybe need to be there for supply chain
or sales or anything. So, it's just, it's grown so many jobs.
Jared Schmidt 35:47
Yeah. That's, that's super cool.
Steve Marko 35:50
Yeah, yeah.
Jared Schmidt 35:51
I't encouraging.
Steve Marko 35:52
It's, it's incredibly energizing, sometimes stressful, but a neat story that is fun to tell.
Jared Schmidt 35:59
Right. Well, and then you know, that idea of, a story to tell, when you see, when you're out of,
you know, Portland and Tillamook area when you're out traveling around, when you see, you
know, Tillamook Cheese, or the cream cheese, what comes to mind when you, when you see it,
the, the Tillamook product.
Steve Marko 36:20
I'm always proud, I, I...It's always fun to, not only see it in the stores, but then as, sometimes I'll
be walking in a grocery store, and, I might be shopping for something else. And I'll look over
and I see someone's hand reaching for a block of Tillamook cheese, or pulling one of our great,
you know, yogurts off the shelf and bringing it in. It's just, it's a pretty proud moment to know
that I had a small part in that and, and I know they're reaching for it, because they just, they
love the product.
S
S
S
S
Jared Schmidt 36:48
Yeah, that's super great. And my mom and dad will text me a picture every now and then back
in Minnesota if they see Tillamook cheese in a grocery store, and...
Steve Marko 36:57
Which is, which is something. It was very hard to get our cheese in that, that's a, that's cheese
making country there. And they don't like us to come in and compete. So they're, they've been
very gracious to now bring us in and accept who we are.
Jared Schmidt 37:01
Yeah, that is a hard market. So coming from the Upper Midwest, that is, I'm sure it is a very
difficult market to, to get into.
Steve Marko 37:17
Yeah. But we have great respect for what they do, and great respect for what we do. And it's
just, you know, we're all just trying to, it's really all for farmers. So together, we're helping to
make lives of farmers better. So it's, we're happy to help each other in any way we can.
Jared Schmidt 37:35
Right. With that real quick, then, do you, you mentioned, like, different regions have different
ideas of cheddar, color, or flavor profile. Do you, do you and your team make your design, or
research cheese to be broad, or you, broad profile to meet the whole country? Or do you make
different variations to be like, well, with Wisconsin people, or Sconnies like this, or Floridians
like that. And you change the cheese to be...?
Steve Marko 38:02
No.
Jared Schmidt 38:02
Never. Okay.
Steve Marko 38:03
Tillamook cheese is Tillamook cheese. It's the way, unfortunately, like it or not, it's the way we
like to make it. [Jared laughs] And then our job is to go out and say, "This is who we are. This is
what we do. I hope you like our cheese. But this is, this is Oregon. This is Tillamook cheese."
S
S
S
S
Yeah, it doesn't change. And it hasn't changed for 100 years.
Jared Schmidt 38:25
Mkay. What do you think the future for your department looks like as far as innovation or
anything exciting that you could, that you can share?
Steve Marko 38:36
Yeah, I, you know, I think, the fun part is, as we've grown as a farming manufacturer that
started 100 years ago, we've only had a research and development department for only about
the last eight years.
Jared Schmidt 38:50
Oh really?
Steve Marko 38:50
So it's really new. And so, in the last eight years, we have launched more products than that,
then the company has ever launched in its first, first eighty.
Jared Schmidt 39:03
Hmm.
Steve Marko 39:03
So it's an exciting time at Tillamook. So we are innovating all around new ice creams. We're
looking at all kinds of new, definitely new chesses. Those are happening. We're innovating and
looking at new sustainable packaging.
Jared Schmidt 39:21
Mhm.
Steve Marko 39:21
We are, we're bringing in culinary chefs, now, to look at how can, how, how is the performance
of our product? How does it change the way they're able to bring food and put food on the table
at home?
S
S
S
S
Jared Schmidt 39:33
Mhm.
Steve Marko 39:34
We're evolving the food service, how can we help restaurants achieve what they've never been
able to achieve before because those products didn't exist?
Jared Schmidt 39:43
Yeah.
Steve Marko 39:44
So we're, we're really branching out into new areas that isn't just about just the grocery store.
Jared Schmidt 39:52
Right. Not just, yeah, the more, the more inclusive, broader economics of food.
Steve Marko 39:59
Yeah. Yeah. And we're also bringing in a, like, most recently, I just hired a sensory scientist. She
has a master's degree in sensory. And we are building new ways to look at our foods and build
unbiased ways to benchmark what is the best tasting products we can produce. Because, you
know, sometimes, if I'm making it, I might think it's the best tasting and so I'm a little biased
there. [Jared laughs] So...
Jared Schmidt 40:25
Right.
Steve Marko 40:26
You know, food science and the way we look at it is, is evolving and it's really, really kind of fun.
Jared Schmidt 40:33
That's exciting. Well, one last question, I want to honor our time commitment here. Do you
have a favorite cheese and if so, what is it and why?
S
S
S
S
have a favorite cheese and if so, what is it and why?
Steve Marko 40:42
Oh, that's really, really easy.
Jared Schmidt 40:46
Oh! [Laughs]
Steve Marko 40:47
I got an opportunity to try the 2010 Makers Reserve. Now, this is probably pretty elite, but it's,
you know, it is almost, almost twelve-years-old now. And it is the finest cheddar cheese I've
ever had in my life. It is, it is crunchy with tyrosine crystals, it is, yeah, it brittle, it crumbles and
falls apart. It is very extra sharp, but not overpowering, it creams in your mouth and it just
leaves such a long lasting finish. And I'm, I'm both a Northwest beer lover and no and a wine
lover. So it pairs with so many, so many intense wines and beers and things together. So it's
just a, it's a pretty neat experience. I'll have to get you some to make sure you can try it.
Jared Schmidt 41:01
Mhm. I would love that! I would be more than excited. What, what beer and wine do you, would
you recommend to pair it with?
Steve Marko 41:48
Definitely kind of, a little more malty forward like a, like a stout, or even a heavy ale. I mean, it
can hold up really big.
Jared Schmidt 42:00
Mkay.
Steve Marko 42:00
And then you can go all the way and do the big Cabernets or the boldest Pinot Noirs that you
want to have with this one, with this cheese. It even, you know, there's a few folks might even
have paired it once or twice with a scotch. Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 42:16
If it's the cheese that can hold up to a scotch, that's at that's a strong cheese. That means good
S
S
S
S
If it's the cheese that can hold up to a scotch, that's at that's a strong cheese. That means good
things.
Steve Marko 42:21
Yeah, I wrote, you know what fun is I was asked to write a paper a couple months ago on
whiskey pairings with cheeses. And, I have to admit, I hadn't done that before. So I had to learn
myself.
Jared Schmidt 42:34
Hmmm.
Steve Marko 42:34
And what I found is really sweeter style, maybe wheat forward, whiskies, they pair really nicely
with your younger cheeses, your mild and mediums. You're sharp to extra sharp could start to
pair with a little more rhy forward, maybe bourbons and American whiskeys.
Jared Schmidt 42:50
Mhm.
Steve Marko 42:50
And then it's not until you get into the extra, extra sharp, three years and older, can they really
hold up to some of those bigger scotches and heavier, heavier bourbon and whiskies. So there's
your quick inside tour of whiskey and cheese.
Jared Schmidt 43:06
I like that. So when you got into this job, you probably didn't think you'd be ending up doing
scotch and cheddar pairings [Laughs].
Steve Marko 43:12
No, not at all. Not at all. But that's why I never know what's coming next. That's why I love my
job.
Jared Schmidt 43:18
That's excellent. Well, that's all I have for you today, Steve. Anything else you'd like to add
S
S
S
S
before we conclude, or?
Steve Marko 43:24
No, thank you for your time. I'm really excited for this, this project. It's, it's nice to share a little
bit of what we do in our lives and our careers and why we love what we do.
Jared Schmidt 43:37
Sounds good. Well, I'll stop the recording here. Thank you, Steve, very much.
S
