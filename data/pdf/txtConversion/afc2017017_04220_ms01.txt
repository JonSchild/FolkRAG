KS: Just set up these guys, this is Kim Stryker, today is the… 
MN: 19th of January 
KS: 19th of January, 2018. Um, and I’m here with Melanie Natoli. Am I pronouncing it right? 
MN: That is correct 
KS: The emphasis is on the right syllable? 
MN: Yup. 
KS: And we’re at Cana Vineyards and Winery in Middleburg, Virginia. And, we’re in actually 
the Bridal Suite—for where they do, when brides want to get ready for their weddings that they 
also host here. So we’ll go ahead and sit down and start going over questions. Um—it’s a 
beautiful sunny day. What time is it? It’s 1: 10 [p.m.].

(00:00:54) 
KS: So um, Melanie you’re the winemaker here? Right? 
MN: I am. 
KS: And so, what does being a winemaker entail? 
MN: What does it NOT entail? Um, Winemaker/Vineyard Manager/Shipping and Receiving 
Department, Warehouse, Inventory, etc., etc. It’s not unusual to have many hats as a winemaker 
in a small family-winery in Virginia. Most of us do that. 
KS: Mmmhmm… 
MN: In the vineyard, I’m in charge of running the vineyard. And making the decisions for 
everything we’re doing with our campaign management, our sprays, and when we pick our 
grapes, when we bring them in and processing—every, every step along…

(00:01:45) 
KS: Right? So maybe at a bigger operation you might have like someone who actually manages 
the crops? Like goes out and does all the field stuff. 
MN: You could have a lot of somebodies! You could have someone who’s like the manager or 
like a whole team running it, as well. 
KS: Right, right. 
MN: Then on the cellar side, you could have someone that just runs the lab work…that’s still 
me. 
KS: Right. 
MN: You would have someone that’s just doing the cleaning, you know? ... that’s still me. You 
would have someone writing the plan and making the decisions…which is also ME here! 
(00:02:24) 
KS: Is that actually part of the appeal for you here? That you do kind of have your hands in 
everything? 
MN: I love it! I do, I do. This is only winery kind of setting I’ve worked in. So, I haven’t been in 
an operation where my job would be fielded by ten different people. So, I’ve always done a good 
mix of things. But, even in wineries here in Virginia that are a little bit bigger, you still have 
some winemakers that are a little bit more removed. Big wineries in California, the winemaker 
could sit behind a desk and look at spreadsheets. And that’s horribly unappealing for me. So 
yeah, especially for my estate wines here, it’s really nice to know that there isn’t a single step 
along the life-cycle of that— wine that my hands aren’t physically on it. 
KS: Yeah, and I think, maybe, is…that’s pretty unique for, for Virginia wine…winemaker…I 
would say. What am I trying to say? It seems like more Virginia wineries are smaller and family 
run, so there’s more of that sort of experience of doing everything and seeing it from start to 
finish. And… 
MN: Absolutely, absolutely. 
KS: Yeah ---and to bottling. 
MN: But, I think even in some of the smaller ones, my neighbors that I talk to and we discuss 
things… I’ll still get looks like ‘You did that?’ Even in smaller ones, they’re still pretty surprised 
that I’m doing pretty much everything.

KS: Yeah, yeah. Um, so, previously. Where did you grow up? We’re in Middleburg right now. 
Do you live in Middleburg or near here? 
MN: No, I live north of Front Royal. So, I’m in in Warren County. I’m on the mountain, west 
from here. 
KS: So, it takes you about how long to get out here? 
MN: About 35 minutes. Which is my shortest winery commute ever, so I think it’s fabulous. 
KS: Right. 
MN: And there is NO traffic, I think I’ve had traffic twice since I’ve started working here about 
2 and a half years ago. And once, because there was a couple of loose goats. 
KS: OH, haha! 
MN: So, we all had to stop our cars and try to corral them into the right house. And then, when 
they have the horse and pony show on the road, they stop so the horses can cross. It’s nice traffic. 
It’s— 
KS: Yeah, that’s 
MN: —it’s pretty. 
(00:04:37) 
KS: — that’s cute traffic. Um, so, we were talking about. So, you live there. Is that where you 
grew up? 
MN: No, I’m originally from New Jersey. 
KS: Oh, okay! So when did you come to Virginia? 
MN: I came to Virginia in 2006. 
(00: 04:58) 
KS: And um, so, do you have any kind of wine background before you came out here? 
MN: Nope! 
KS: No? 
MN: Nope. 
KS: So, just, anything in your family? Like anybody? Did you drink wine at home or anything? 
MN: No, and I think that’s a big part of why I found this later as my second career because it’s 
not something that I was ever exposed to. And I think, that’s probably the case for a lot of us 
around here. You know, if you’re in Europe or a family with wine on the table, it’s a thought 
that…you can see it as a potential career. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
KS: Mmhm 
MN: For me, it’s never anything I was exposed to. I… did not taste wine until I was 21! 
KS: Okay 
MN: So no, no exposure to it any sooner. 
KS: Yeah, it’s funny. I mean, all over. We get all over the chart from people who like really had 
it as a normal part of their life to what you’re saying—like never having any experience with it 
until as an adult. 
MN: I mean, I had gone…tasting. I think, so the first wine taste I had gone to was in Newport, 
Rhode Island. And that was a long time ago. And I’d be really curious to go back there and see 
what I think of the wine now that I know so much more about wine…and see if I still like it. 
(00:06:14) 
KS: Do you still have family back in New Jersey? 
MN: Uhhh, a little bit of extended family. But, some of my family moved to the Eastern Shore of 
Virginia…whic h is a nicer place to visit. 
KS: Ah, yeah. Um, so you came to Virginia in 2006? What were you coming here for? 
MN: Oh, THAT’S irrelevant. 
KS: Oh, okay! 
MN: [laughter] Yeah, that’s irrelevant. I came here. I came here with someone else and kinda got 
stuck in Virginia. Because I was supporting us, I signed a contract for a sign-on bonus. It wasn’t 
my decision to move to this area. Um, I kinda got stuck here, but it was probably the best thing 
that ever happen to me because I wouldn’t be where I am right now if if all of that didn’t happen. 
(00:06:58) 
KS: Sometimes, yeah, serendipity. You were supposed to come here. You probably didn’t feel 
like that at the time. So you were working before, you said, as a physical therapist? 
MN: Yup! I got my Masters in Physical Therapy in 2003…and I worked in New Jersey, New 
Mexico, Maryland, West Virginia, and Virginia… 
KS: Wow 
MN: …as a physical therapist. And I was a PT [physical therapist] for 8 years. But, the last 2 
years is when I started in the wine industry. 
KS: Okay 
MN: So, I was lucky enough that my first career was in demand and paid me well enough so I 
could go per diem. And I worked 3 days a week as a PT, I met my expenses. And then, 3 other 
days of the weeks, I interned…in the cellars, in the vineyards. We did that for 2 years, until I…

#WineEducation #LuckettsVA 
(00:07:50) 
KS: When was that? 
MN: That was 2009. 2009-2011. 
KS: So that was kind of your education period? 
MN: Yup. 
KS: Okay, where was that first internship? 
MN: That was Fabbioli Cellars in Lucketts, Virginia. 
KS: So do they not grow there? Fabbioli Cellars. Do they have a vineyard as well? 
MN: They have a vineyard as well… 
KS: Some people just… 
MN: Some people call themselves vineyards, some people call themselves wineries, or cellars. It 
may or may not have something to do with what they do. 
(00:08: 30) 
KS: Okay, good to know. So they had an internship program? Or they just did it for you? 
MN: Uh, Doug has taken a few interns there before. And, I had met him somewhere before. We 
talked a couple times. I was actually originally planning to move to California and take an 
official program at one of the universities out there. And, I met him and he would say ‘No, you 
don’t really have to do that.’ I met another winemaker that said ‘Oh no, you better because 
without the paper I had a friend that never moved up and they kept telling him that he would. 
You have to go to school’. And that was coming from someone that did go to school. So, I was 
really close to moving out there. And I was like ‘You know what? Hold on. What do you mean, I 
don’t have to go to school?’ 
KS: Right 
MN: Because right now, I’m still paying off my first two college degrees that I’m NO longer 
really using so much. 
KS: Right 
MN: so I was like, okay, let’s see if we can be smart about this. 
KS: [laughter] yeah, let’s do this without all the loans, yeah… 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
MN: So, he actually had an intern at the time. And he said, ‘Well, see if you can find a spot. I’ll 
help you find a spot with someone, if you can’t’. I had been working at another winery, just in 
the tasting room… 
KS: Mmhmm 
MN: …on weekends just to try and get closer to the industry. I did a couple days with the 
winemaker there. Doug called me up and said ‘You know what, wanna come out tomorrow? 
We’re gonna pick and process merlot.’ [she replied to Doug] ‘Sure!’ So, I went out for the day. 
KS: Mmhmm 
MN: And, it was probably a 10 or 11 hour day. We were in the vineyard picking all day and 
processing. And, he was out there with us which was great. He has a lot of experience in the 
industry and I was just picking his brain-fine. Which is all…I have an opportunity. I’m gonna 
ask whatever I want! The end of a long day. We sat down, as most winemakers do, with a beer. 
It’s always in your hand at the end of the day, not wine during harvest. 
KS: Yeah, not when you’re doing sweaty… dirty fieldwork! Yeah, I know. 
MN: And he said, ‘So you still really want to do this?’ And I’m like ‘Absolutely!’ He’s like, 
‘Okay, I want you to stay and I want to pay you.’ And I’m like, ‘I’m here.’ So… 
KS: That worked out well 
MN: Yeah, he had an intern who ended up shifting more to the front-of-the-house side of the 
industry. She learned…she didn’t want to be in production. She’s like, “’You know, I really like 
food so I tried to be in the kitchen.’ Nope. ‘I really liked wine, tried to make wine…’ Nope, 
that’s not it.” And she found her calling more on the P.R. [public relations] side of things. He 
was kinda happy to have someone… 
(00:10:58) 
KS: …who could get in there and get their hands dirty a little bit. Yeah, so, he brought you in? 
So he was kind of your first introduction? And is his last name Fabbioli? 
MN: Correct. 
KS: Doug Fabbioli of Fabbioli Cellars and they’re out in… 
MN: Lucketts 
KS: Lucketts. 
MN: So they’re just north of us here in the county.

(00:11:15) 
KS: Right, right. And, so that was 2009? And you stayed with him the whole time until 2011? 
MN: Past that actually. So 2009-2011, I worked both jobs. 2011, I went full-time in the industry. 
It lined up well with his business growing as well, so that 2011 he brought me in full-time as the 
assistant winemaker. And I stayed there, 2011 through 2013? 2013 would have been my last 
harvest. So early in 2014 is when I left from there. So I was there for a little while. 
(00:11:58) 
KS: So that’s a great experience. It’s almost like a European-type of apprenticeship to be able to 
work there and work alongside him. Was he kind of guiding the process with you? 
MN: In the beginning! And then less, obviously, as time went on. You know, and there’s, also a 
lot of great resources for us in the state to learn as well. I had all my hands-on learning with 
Doug there, learning how he approaches wine making. Which is great to learn, but there’s a lots 
of different ways to do what we can do. So we want to get as much different experience as we 
can get. (Melanie elaborates on this discussing that Virginia is a 1.4 billion dollar industry that 
the state understands and supports by assigning an extension agent based out of Virginia Tech 
(one on the winery side and one on the vineyard side. 
(00:13:31) 
MN: (Melanie discusses how the winery/vineyard industry is close-knit and knows who she can 
talk to about certain industry-related questions.) We want our industry to succeed. We don’t 
want anyone making a really bad wine or putting Virginia on the label because it doesn’t do any 
of us good. (Melanie uses one of her own experiences as an example when she reached out for 
help to the folks in the industry over the phone after a hailstorm in her vineyard). 
(00:13:58) 
KS: Is it mostly like a get on the phone thing? Or do y ’all have any kind of listserv or group 
page or anything that you use as a resource? 
MN: (Melanie affirms that there is a little bit of both.) 
KS: But maybe you have more of a relationship with somebody, or maybe you know that 
somebody is particularly experienced with a certain type of grape or a certain type of issue.

#LoudounCountyWineries 
(00:14:36) 
MN: And also use our extension agents. So Tremain Hatch is our vineyard extension agent. 
(Kim comments on extension agent’s unique name and Melanie spells out his name. Melanie 
breaks down what Tremain Hatch does and also references that he has a personal interest in 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
Virginia Wine because his family owns Zephaniah Vineyards in Loudoun County. States that 
Tremain is based out of the Winchester office. Melanie also shares a story of her experience of 
him coming out to her vineyard.) 
(00:15:40) 
KS: (Kim asks questions for clarification of Tremain Hatch’s job as an Extension Agent). 
“They’re salary is paid by the state? Their job is to research issues that would affect your 
industry and to be on call and available to you guys?” (MN confirms that this is correct.) 
 
 
#CreeksEdgeWinery #LovettsvilleVA #2014 #GrapeTesting #Pick Dates 
(00:15:55) 
KS: So going back to our timeline, its early 2014. You left. And you went where? 
MN: I went to Creek’s Edge in Lovettsville. I did one harvest there. One season, one vintage. 
KS: Was that your? Were you a full-time winemaker? 
MN: Mmhmm 
KS: Did you have the same kind of role as here? Where you were kind of a jack of all trades? 
(00:16:31) 
MN: I came on board and they were just starting up. (Melanie describes her role at Creek’s Edge 
discussing that they had just opened that year and the vineyard was already in place and they had 
some wine that was produced by another winemaker off-site, so they had some inventory to sell. 
They still had some overlap from the winemaker running that vineyard that season. She states the 
vineyard was not really hers because it was still being managed by this other winemaker. She 
tested the grapes and called all the ‘pick dates’. Kim follows up on Melanie’s timeline. Melanie 
affirms that she was only at Creek’s Edge for 2014. She states that in early 2015, she came on 
board with Cana Vineyards.)

(00:17:15) 
KS: What appealed to you about this [Cana Vineyards] position? 
MN: Well, I know, I. I was quickly left without a job, so I needed to find a place to land. The 
previous winemaker was Brendan McMahon, who is a friend and colleague of mine in the 
industry. (Melanie describes that Brendan needed help and became his co-winemaker at Cana 
Vineyards, splitting the job with him as his schedule became busier. Melanie discusses what 
Brenden does now in the wine industry after he left Cana in 2016 doing mobile filtration.) 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
(00:19:08) 
KS: What is the filtration process doing? 
MN: It is sterilizing the wine. (Melanie goes into more detail on the process of filtering wine for 
consumption.) 
(00:19:28) 
KS: At that point, does it kind of fix the wine a bit? Like where it’s at in its development? Or 
will the wine continue to be developing? I mean, obviously you age bottles of wine. But, I guess 
it’s just preventing overgrowth of something you don’t want to be growing in there. (Melanie 
responds that is the easiest way of describing the filtration process. Kim follows up by asking 
what Brenden’s filtration business is called—‘Mid-Atlantic Cross Flow’. Kim reestablishes 
timeline by confirming that Brenden left Cana completely in 2016 and Melanie took over 
completely as the only winemaker for Cana.) 
#LessBell #KarenBell #MelanieAsCanaWinemaker 
(00:20:30) 
KS: Whereas some of these small family-owned wineries, maybe the owners are the ones doing 
the winemaking and figure out the whole thing and learn it from scratch…Less and Karen…how 
does Karen spell her name? (Melanie spells out Karen’s name and states their last name is Bell.) 
…so they’re the owners and they help and they have ideas. Did they at any point figure that out 
or have they always relied on the winemaker to make those major decisions? 
MN: They’ve always had someone to work for them that knew what they were doing. Which is 
good! Because you know, some of the smaller ones are people that really do make great wine 
and know what they’re doing. And sometimes, someone thinks it’s an easy thing to do and 
they’re just gonna try it…and it doesn’t always work as well. (Kim responds to this by telling 
Melanie about how people make bad wine in Saudi Arabia, Melanie briefly explains the 
fermentation and winemaking process.) 
(00:22:57) 
KS: So when Brandon was leaving, you felt comfortable here? Had a good relationship with 
them as the owners? So it was sort of like the natural progression of things? (Melanie affirms 
each question with a ‘Yup’.) What is your relationship like with them as far as making the calls 
and decisions and what to plan, and what to prune, and what to do? 
MN: It’s great because they trust me to do my job, which I think is the best that anyone doing 
anything could hope for. Right? Yeah, I’m given a lot of freedom. They trust that I’m doing what 
I need to for them and I work very hard to make them the best wine that I can…that their names 
on.

Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
(00:23:38) KS: What is the calendar year like for you? (Kim points out as an example that they 
had just gone through the process of bottling of some of the white wines from the 2017 harvest.) 
MN: January, we just bottled the white wines from the previous year’s harvest. (Melanie 
outlines her calendar year—mentions doing a second bottling sometime in March/April with red 
wines from the year before, April is bud-break [vineyards waking up starting to bloom], crop- 
maintenance starts and continues up-to harvest early-mid September and finish that up in 
November [bring in fruit, processing grapes, etc.], December to April is catch-up time to attend 
conferences and workshops, as well as other winery work). 
KS: Conferences? What kind of conferences do you go to? 
MN: Virginia Vineyards Association in Charlottesville (Melanie elaborates a little further 
on this discussing that a panel on the labor issues would be present this year.) 
(00:27:08) KS: That brings me to an interesting question with Cana here with the volunteer 
squads that come in? I participated in the harvest and a little bit of the bottling. Why is that the 
way you guys decided to go, instead of bringing in crews? 
MN: You have to be big enough to have a pretty sizeable crew to that you’re going to 
keep for the most part year round. If you want someone to do good work for you, you need to 
employ them most of the year. Especially for bottling, a lot of wineries use volunteers. (Melanie 
elaborates on volunteering as a solution for smaller operations to get work done like picking or 
bottling. Kim follows up about asking about hand-bottling and Melanie discusses how quickly 
hand-bottling can go wrong, i.e. contamination). 
(00:30:23) KS: (refers back to Kim’s experience with bottling at Cana) So the process for the 
bottling you had the boxes full of empty bottles, dump them on the conveyer belt, and then are 
they being sanitized? (Melanie affirms this.) So they go in, they get sanitized, they get filled, 
then they get capped, then they get labeled, and then packed into a case? 
MN: Yup, so our hands aren’t on them until they’re closed. (Melanie talks about the level 
of trust involved with each bottle). 
 
 
#FermentationBreakDown #WineMaking #WineMakingHazards #CO2 #BrixTest 
(00:31:38) KS: In the actual wine-making part of it, I mean obviously every part has a role in it. 
But in the actual after you harvested, what is the wine-making part of it? 
MN: That’s your fermentation time. (Melanie breaks down the fermentation process and 
how she monitors the fermentation process.) 
KS: Isn’t it something like the yeast eats the sugar? The sugar is the food? (Kim makes a 
joke and Melanie laughs and tells her that she has a great cartoon graphic downstairs to 
show Kim later about the process). 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
MN: Yeah, they’re eating the sugar and the byproducts are the CO2 [Carbon dioxide] and 
alcohol. 
(00:33:12) KS: So what do you do with the CO2? So you want fizzy in somethings…but… 
MN: The CO2 during fermentation is going to blow off. If you wanted a wine to be 
sparkling, you’re going to do something else to make that. It’s in the room, so you need 
to be careful during harvest time because because it’s in the room. So you need to know 
if it feels like there’s a lot of CO2 in the room, you need to get all the windows and doors 
open. (Kim follows up and asks if there are censors, Melanie tells Kim that there can be 
terrible harvest accidents that can happen every year.) 
(00:34:23) KS: So the CO2 is coming off, the fermentation is happening which is creating the 
alcohol…What are your meters? How are you detecting what the levels of the sugars are and 
everything? Is there a taste thing? Are there like little chemical things? 
MN: Neither. I’m pulling a sample every day. (She tests the temperature from each 
sample. And for testing the sugar, Melanie performs a Brix test.) 
#Fall2017Wines #Viognier #PetitManseng #StateGrapeDebate 
(00:35:06) KS: So what are you, for instance this fall, what were you working on? What wines? 
MN: So I made from our estate here, we have the petit manseng and a very small lot of 
the viognier. (Melanie comments that Kim didn’t see the viognier on bottling day, that she 
produced 32 cases of viognier. Historically, she has always incorporated the viognier grapes with 
the petit manseng because it’s harder for her to make small batches of wine because their 
operation is not set up for that, discusses creative control in winemaking). 
(00:36:26) KS: Do you think you’ll plant more Viognier? 
MN: I don’t know…I’ve been so against the idea, uh, initially because it doesn’t grow 
very well. 
KS: A lot of people seem to grow it though in Virginia, I feel like! 
MN: There’s a consumer demand. People like it. The marketing board decided to call it 
our state grape…it’s not official legislation. But, they did. And people like it…honestly, I 
don’t. It’s not my favorite. And, it’s difficult to work with. (Melanie elaborates on the 
difficulties of working with the viognier grapes and that maybe it’s not the best Virginia 
grape. She explains why she prefers planting petit manseng instead.) 
(00:38:17) KS: (Kim explains what the background noise is coming from a group of women 
possibly tasting in the other room.) 
 
 
#GrowingChallenges #GrowingPains #WineMakingObstacles #Viticulture 
(00:38:36) KS: What are some of the challenges that you find about your work? 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
MN: There are so many. There really are. And that’s not all bad. (Melanie elaborates on 
being a farmer and grape-grower, discusses how one bad storm can wipe out a crop, and 
discusses the weather from her first year as a full-time winemaker back in 2014). The 
challenge makes it exciting! 
(00:42:16) KS: What are some of the things that people don’t know about what you do? I’m sure 
because you do so many things! What are some of things that you think are the common 
misconceptions about what you do? 
MN: Hmmm…it’s a lot of hard work. It’s really fun and I love everything about it, but 
it’s not for everyone. You spend a lot of time freezing and soaking wet. (Melanie 
elaborates about how some people might have a romantic idea of what it is to be a 
winemaker. Kim and Melanie discuss the romantic ideal versus the reality of 
winemaking.) 
(00:43:37) KS: What are some of the biggest obstacles you find that you have to overcome? 
MN: It’s a blessing that I get to do everything and I appreciate that I’m so involved. But, 
gosh! There’s times were it would be nice to have a second set of hands. (Melanie 
discusses why.) 
(00:44:15) KS: Is there a particular aspect of your job, like of the many hats that you wear, what 
do you find to be the most challenging or difficult? 
MN: I mean, there’s dealing with, responding to, and anticipating the weather as a 
grower, of course. And then there’s…everyone else you have to work with. So I guess, 
you know, being by myself and doing everything so much that sometimes when you have 
to rely on an outside vendor to do their job…I think that’s the most stressful! (Melanie 
uses the previous bottling of this past harvest as a ‘really good’ example of it.) 
(00:45:25) KS: Do you have any plans to bring on somebody? Like to do something similar like 
what your experience was? To have an intern? Or to have an apprentice kind-of position? 
MN: It all depends on how the business here goes. For the most part, most of the time, we 
get everything done. (Melanie discusses why she might not have enough work to keep 
someone on in that capacity for long.) 
(00:46:00) KS: Do you get interest from people, like kids in the community or something that 
might want to look into doing something like this? 
MN: Um, sometimes…not a whole lot. 
KS: (Kim discusses a program in Madison County with a woman who has a program 
where high school kids can learn about viticulture.) Is there…Do you know of anything 
going on like that around here? 
MN: Not a whole lot. You’ll see some wineries pick up some kids during the summer.

(00:47:28) KS: What do you think is speaking more of the big picture Virginia wine? What are 
the changes you’ve seen since you entered the industry…like coming in around what was it 2005-
2006? (Melanie corrects timeline saying more like 2009 was when she entered.) 
KS:So since 2009, I mean, I think one thing everyone’s says has been astronomical 
growth in the number of wineries and people getting into the business. Um, what are 
some of the changes that you’ve seen? Good? Bad? Different? 
MN: I mean, it’s interesting. There’s there’s more and more and more. But, we’re starting 
to feel like that, oh, we might have enough...I think... And, I just hope that everyone can focus 
on… quality. You know, and that’s that’s what’s going to sustain us. And, there are lots of 
groups of winemakers working very hard to put us on the map as quality wine producers. But, it 
isn’t everybody. It’s interesting. You know when I think about other wine regions. The only 
thing that would interest me is that maybe I could be somewhere that I just really grow really 
good grapes and make really good wine and that’s all that has to be worried about. It’s it’s just 
done. And in Virginia, we’re still a tourism-based industry. 
(Melanie goes on to discuss the ups and downs of having a tourism-based industry vs. the focus 
on just the production of the product in other regions, discusses doing good on the front-of-the- 
house scene in creating a destination that people want to visit.)

(00:50:18) KS: I know you guys have won some awards for your wines…is that… how does that 
work? You sub-submit your wine for consideration? 
MN: Hmhmm…and pay them money… 
KS: Oh, good—and, there’s different kind of… Governor’s Cup is? 
MN: The big one for just us here in Virginia. 
KS: Do you also sometimes submit to national or international competitions? 
MN: Yeah, yeah! (Melanie begins to list the competitions she normally submits Cana 
wines for: Finger Lakes, San Francisco, and Women’s International Competition. Kim 
and Melanie joke about the number of wine competitions there are and why she chooses 
which competitions to submit their wines to.)

MN: This is typically how you’ll find me. 
KS: Is there anything special you have to where for different parts of the process? (Kim 
gives the example of scrubs, Melanie states that she doesn’t really have anything like that 
for her job.) 
(00:52:40) KS: Tools that you always have on hand? Things that you do to do your work? 
Different times of year, different things obviously— 
MN: (Melanie starts to list various tools that she uses: pruners, cell phone, calculator, 
juice pans, and conversion app for various measurement units.) 
(00:53:31) KS: Do you do the brix thermometer kind of thing that people take into the orchard 
when they’re testing the grapes? Is that something you squeeze the juice onto it or something? 
MN: So, I have a different refractometer that looks a little bit different that I keep here in 
the lab. (Melanie explains why she prefers to use her refractometer in her lab vs. the portable 
Brix Thermometer. She mentions that she pulls grapes from all over the tree into sample bags 
and takes over the tasting room to sample and test the grapes to get the most accurate reading as 
to whether or not the grapes are ready. Kim and Melanie joke that the work motto should be 
‘Sticky but Satisfying’. 
(00:55:06) KS: So who else do you have on staff here? 
MN: For me, on the back-of-the-house production side, I got one other guy. (Melanie 
explains that he’s full-time, it’s the two of them that manage everything in the vineyard, 
does a lot of the grounds maintenance, helps with the harvest, etc. Kim provides possible 
examples and Melanie affirms that these examples are accurate.) 
(00:55:59) KS: Um, okay. Well, it’s a little after two, so maybe we should wrap this portion? 
MN: Sure! 
(00:56:06) KS: If you have some time if you’d be able to show me around a little bit where you 
work? And we can talk about some of the stuff you use and what you use it for? (Melanie agrees 
throughout these questions that she would like to show Kim her work space.)

(00:56:18) MN: —We’re creating a new friend for him. (There is a buzzing sound in the 
background, voices are faded.) 
KS: What is the name of the yeast again so I can get that on here? 
MN: Saccharomyces Cerevisiae. 
KS: I will look that up! (Melanie and Kim laugh.) Oh my god, that’s a lot of wording! 
MN: Yup! 
(00:56:35) KS: So what is some of the other stuff that you play with in here? This is your 
playroom, really. Isn’t it? 
MN: It is! This is my lab— (Kim and Melanie move through the lab looking at various 
things, joking about the wine lab being Frankenstein’s lab.) 
KS: Um, what are these? 
MN: Yes, hiking boots! Very important. 
KS: I like thattt—So they don’t get confused… 
MN: Yeah, they go with my pink coat and my pink…. yeah, so part of it we started 
working off in cellars with other people and they’re not going to touch anything that’s 
pink. I have a pink flashlight! I had a electrician that had to borrow it one time and like 
“Oh, I’m not keeping this—” and I’m like “Exactlyyy, you’re not. You don’t want to.” 
So you get it all back, right? Um, and then, my favorite wine is rosé. So, I’m in love with 
the color pink now because its my favorite wine to make. (Kim jokes about pink being 
Melanie’s favorite color because she’s not a girly girl and states that it must be easy to 
spot Melanie out in the fields.) 
#Tartrate #Sulfites #WineHeadacheFalsehoods #Yeast #Fermentation 
#NaturalNativeMethod #CommericialStrains 
(00:57:43) KS: What’s this thing here do? 
MN: That’s my tartrator. So, I do a lot of my lab work with that. (Melanie discusses that 
there’s a bunch of different tests she runs with it, such as: the total acidity of the wine, 
Yeast assimilable nitrogen for fermenting [tells the fermentation for the yeast], etc. She 
explains that it helps her know the nutrition she needs for her yeast by giving her a 
number. The number will change every year and she uses it to check her sulfurs as well to 
help preserve the wine.) 
KS: People say the sulfites give me headaches or whatever, but— 
MN: They’re full of crap! Because sulfites don’t give you headaches because they’re 
more sulfites in a lot of other things you consume than there is wine… (Melanie provides 
examples such as eating from a salad bar, dried fruit. Melanie jokes that maybe people

Not 100% sure this is correct. Tried googling  
and found a similar word in winemaking—
Tartrate.

that complain about the sulfites in wine giving them headaches is just from them drinking 
too much alcohol. Kim jokes back that maybe they should just drink some water.) 
MN: It’s a bunch of nonsense! (Kim laughs.) And here’s the biggest part of that is if you 
have a cellar that has ever even once in the history of that building existing introduced a 
commercial yeast strain, its in there. But when you say, its natural. It’s not what came out 
of the vineyard. (Melanie goes into a deeper explanation of how these commercial strains 
work because they are engineered to be stronger). 
(1:00:37) KS: Especially, if you’re in a wine region, where there’s lots of other people growing 
wines I would think there’d be drift? — 
MN: Absolutely—and they’ve tried! They’ve done some tests where they built a brand 
new facility, did one harvest, and then tried to sterilize the heck out of everything, and they 
couldn’t get it out of there. (Melanie discusses how she knows some people that tried to do the 
‘Natural Native’ thing and no longer do so. She states that in order to make the best wine that 
they can you have to learn. She mentions about how sometimes fermentation will start naturally 
on its own without a yeast being introduced to it, but a lot of the times they stop. As a result, 
something bigger or stronger [yeast] has to be introduced to it for fermentation to complete). 
(1:01:53) KS: What are these big black boxes? — 
MN: Oh, it’s all the electrical stuff. (Melanie states that these hold all the technology for 
the security system, the recorders, the sound system. Kim clarifies the boxes as the AV 
cabinets.) 
#RandomGrapeSamples #LabTesting #OutsourcingSoilTests #Petiole #DriedWineStems 
#OutsourcePetioleTesting #CropNutrients 
(1:02:12) KS: So when you’re in here, this is where you would bring your random sampling…? 
This is where you would do what else? 
MN: Ummm, any kind any kind of lab testing I’m doing. My tool for testing my alcohol 
is in here. Soil testing, I don’t do. I’ll send them off to a lab. So, yeah, I’ll pull those and 
mail ‘em out. Or like um, we do petiole samples here in the vineyard. And, the petiole is 
the little leaf stem. So, you’ll pull the leaf off… the vine and take the blade off and throw 
it out. And, just collect a whole bunch of those little pieces, dry them out, and send them 
to the lab and you know looking at the nutrition. (Melanie explains why it’s important to 
do petiole testing to examine why the vine might not be pulling in certain nutrients from 
the soil.) 
(1:03:15) KS: I hadn’t heard of that and that’s called what? (Melanie clarifies that this testing is 
called petiole and it’s the little leaf stem coming off the vine.)

(1:03:23) KS: (Kim reads a sign in the lab, the beginning half aloud and the last half quietly and 
asks Melanie if she’s reading it correctly in regards to why/how wine is stored traditionally in 
glass and steel with corks. Kim asks Melanie if wine absolutely has to be stored in this manner.) 
You can put it in a lot of things and it would be okay—? 
MN: Depending on the wine, right? (Melanie uses boxed wine as an example because its 
stored in a plastic bag. She states that its not wine that you are going to want to drink later, but it 
keeps the wine better preserved. She also mentions the rise of canned wine. Kim and Melanie 
discuss the aesthetics of storing wine in terms of tradition and prestige.) 
(1:04:34) KS: Can I take your picture? (Melanie agrees. Kim snaps a picture.) 
(1:04:44) KS: Where do you want me to take a picture of you? (Melanie states that they can find 
a spot. Kim jokes about taking pictures. Melanie discusses how she’s just starting to get her 
working quarters back in order after the first bottling of the harvest. Kim mentions that it’s really 
tight in space. They walk outside to various spots and you can hear Kim snapping pictures.) 
(1:05:40) KS: And you even have a pink pallet jack?! (Kim laughs). I love it! 
MN: I was very excited to get it! 
KS: That. Is. Hilarious. (Kim discusses how she’s going to show the picture of the pink 
pallet jack to her husband who owns a vinyl manufacturing business. 
MN: (Kim and Melanie go into another room/building.) Sooo, this is my barrel room!

#WoodGrains #BarrelFermentation #CooperOutsourcing #FrenchVsAmericanCoopers 
(1:06:24) KS: Does everything go in a barrel? Or only some stuff? 
MN: All of my reds are in a barrel. None of my whites are. Um, and that’s mostly 
because of the varieties we do here. (She mentions that she would love to make a chardonnay 
one day, but for now she’s focused on her whites being crisp and aromatic.) This room currently 
has the ’16 and ’17 reds in it. The ‘16s will be coming out soon because they’ll go in the bottle in 
March. And, the ‘17s will stay in here another year. They will all have to flip. (Melanie laughs to 
herself.) I have a big barrel job ahead of me that I keep forgetting about. 
(1:07:16) MN: (Melanie discusses how the fermentation process works in the barrel for a red— 
taking the wine out of the barrels, filtering out the various things that grow in the wine; cleaning, 
sterilizing, and adding the sulfites into the barrel, putting the wine back in, and then placing the 
barrel back on the skein/stacking them.) 
(1:09:52) MN: Now Brendan had this room stacked up five high and not four high. (Melanie 
explains why having the barrels stacked that high is terrifying. She discusses how each barrel is 
25 cases of wine and how emotionally attached you get to the product that it would ‘break my 
heart if I spilled something’. She points out that moving barrels is probably the scariest part of 
her job as a winemaker.)

KS: (Kim relates by discussing her previous beekeeping and how she felt harvesting the 
honey.) But, this is that a million times bigger. So then? 
MN: The ones on this side I can get the forks in. It’s the other side in through there…So 
to get to the corners, I gotta pull the middle out first just so I can get to those ones in the back. 
(Kim mentions that it’s a lot of work.) 
(1:11:18) MN: It is. It is. So then, I think okay all I’m going to do today is lay my barrels out and 
I’ll pump ‘em out tomorrow. It’s only going to take a couple hours. And then like, four hours 
later on the fork lift… I’m like, “Yeah…” 
(1:11:33) KS: (Kim jokes to Melanie about underestimating how long a task will take.) So, um, I think 
Les was telling me? You get, I can see that on the actual barrels themselves I can see all the names 
of…different? 
MN: Different coopers. (Melanie discusses how there are different kinds of oak, stating 
that since she’s been at Cana the only new oak she has purchased is French. She points to 
a barrel stating that it was American oak and that you can tell. Discusses that American 
oak is cut in the United States and sent to France to be made. She prefers French coopers 
to American coopers because the barrels are better made. Kim asks about whiskey barrels 
and Melanie states that she does not like them because of how much they leak from her 
experiences making port. Kim asks about how much a French barrel costs and Melanie 
responds that they cost about $1,000.00.) 
(1:14:12) KS: So you don’t know anybody in the States that’s making wine barrels for American 
wine? (Melanie responds that she thinks there is a lady in New York somewhere. Mentions that 
there is a couple coopers in California. She states that there is Virginia Oaked barrels, but they’re 
still made in France and cracks a joke about how people think they’re practicing the ‘buying 
local’ concept.) 
(1:15:35) KS: So there’s all these difference between…? (Kim starts to read off the various 
grains printed on the barrels. Melanie explains that this indicates the toast levels of the wood in 
the barrels. The grain of the wood affects how wine ages differently.) 
MN: And then, I see that a lot with my French Oak, doing things like that saying the 
grain, instead of—They used to be real big on the forest… (Kim asks clarifying that she 
means where the oak is from. Melanie relates how she knows a cooper out in California 
that doesn’t put that on his barrels because they lie too much [wood distributors].) You 
can say that, but there was too much fudging. (Kim and Melanie laugh and make small 
jokes about the label ‘forest’.) 
(1:17:02) KS: Well, where do you want me to take a picture of you? (Melanie and Kim briefly 
discuss where would be best to take a picture and decide to take the pictures in front of the 
barrels, briefly making small talk about the interview as Kim snaps pictures.)
