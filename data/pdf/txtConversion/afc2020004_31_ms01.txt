Current, I 
The conventional symbol for current is I, (I) originating from the French intensité de courant, an 
intensity of electrical flow measured as a quantity per unit of time. 
 
 
 
Consider: we are made almost entirely of water and electricity. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
So our vernacular  
 
of emotion employs   
 
surge  
 
 
 
 
 
wave spark, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
impulse 
 
and 
current, 
the flood of salt 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
or rush of crackling 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 blue  pulse, of 
 
 
arcing  rivulet. 
 
 
A measurement of with and with 
out. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The ecstatic penetration of sperm 
 
 into egg— 
we have all seen  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the microscopic 
iconography. 
   
The wombless State 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
will ordain 
 this  
 
the electric moment  of life 
 
 
 
 
 
will brand each womb sanctified  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
property. 
 
My mother was conceived 
 
during a war waged on 
 
 brown bodies  
 
 
 
 
 
and birthed 
me under a moon obscured 
 
 
 
 
 
 
by flags. 
 
Electric layers of ocean 
 
 reveal 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 themselves as 
 
an ancestral coding  of me and her  
 and her and her  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
as the spear and the 
plunge, 
 
 
the cavern of handprints 
 
 
the caverns of decapitation.   
 
 
 
 
 
The lightning spark cannot be created because it was already there. 
 
 
In the gloam human nostalgia  
 
 
 
 
 
presses to know  
 
where 
  
 
when which   
 
 
 
 
 
 
gods’ touch 
 
(the first impulse of light into 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 darkness)  
 
first enacted a separation of shadow  into meaning, 
 
 
 
yet    I   
fork 
bead 
 
 
 
 
 
ribbon the  
 
 
light 
 
into existence  insistence 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with each  
sloughing 
 
of salt  water   
blood, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
each  recollection of  
 
current.

(I) 
 
I believe in reincarnation  
 
 
 
 
 
 
in so much  
 
 
as 
 
 
I know  
an ancestor 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
passed   
to  
 
 
me 
 
 
the memory of  
 
 
 
 
making  
  
 
 
oneself  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
into  
 
 
a universe. 
 
 
One.   
 
Self. 
(I) 
 
connected to, no— 
 
 
 
 
 
concurrent 
with 
 
 
 
 
every  
 
iteration 
 
 
 
of  
 
 
 
subatomic 
 
 
 
 
 
movement. 
 
 
How, then 
 
 
 
 
am I 
 
 
queer?  
 
 
 
 
Queer? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Queered? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
I am   
 
also 
 
 
 
only 
 
(queer)  
 
 
 
because  
 
 
there is  
 
 
a world 
 
 
 
 
outside of mine. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If  
 
 
the world were 
 
 
only me,  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
I would  
 
 
seem   
just so.  
 
 
 
A microcosmos 
 
 
 
 
of  
 
animal  
 
 
mineral 
 
 
plant 
 
 
 
light. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Electric, I. 
 
 
 
 
(I) 
 
 
Yet,  
 
 
the world. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Here is what I can say: 
 
I am 
 
 
 I.  
 
 
Warrior, I. 
 
 
 
Glacier, I. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Photon, I.

I. 
 
 
 
 
(I) 
 
Prism, I.  
 
 
And    
culture bending 
 
 
 
 
through 
 me. 
 
 
The world 
spits 
 
 
 
grapples 
 
 
 
 
tries   
 
 
to tie  me up in   
basements 
 
 
to rid   
themselves 
 
 
 
of my insistence. 
 
 
 
Ancestor 
 
 
wired me a path 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
within.  
 
 
 
Inside the brick spaces 
throughout and becoming 
 
the walls 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and 
clouds, I.  
 
 
 
 
Swallow bolts, I 
 
 
 
 
expand 
 
I  
 
empty  
 
 
 
I 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
carry  
within 
 
 
 
 
a hundred 
thousand 
 
 
 
wombs  
 
 
of  
spectacular  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
light.
