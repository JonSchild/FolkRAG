[Elizabeth Woody reads “Coquille”] 
 
Elizabeth Woody:  The canoe is considered a brother; the body and selves are the 
sovereign element of our nations since the beginning of time. Our intermingled 
bloodlines run in all directions. The compass is spirit internal and external of the land 
that guides us and provides the temerity of the Natural Laws of the Creator. What we 
lost in holocaust and in its suppression, taught secretively and practiced in our 
traditions, like the songs of Creation while holding the Cross to supplicate the crown, 
placated the newborn countries amongst us.  
 
Our people are returning the canoe to the waters of the Pacific, Salish Sea, the Rim of 
Fire, and the Great Rivers of the West. They are exerting their influences through 
ceremony and languages of our ancestors and the land. We are one with all life and all 
pasts, for the benefit of those to come.
