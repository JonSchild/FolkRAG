BRENT BJÖRKMAN: Okay, today is May 19, 2014, and this is Brent Björkman 
director of the Kentucky Folklife Program, continuing my work on the Ranger Lore 
project, about the working lives of rangers, mostly in and around the Mammoth 
Cave area. And today I’m with some special guests at their home. Could you tell me 
who you are, and if you’re not working at the park, or did, can you tell me what your 
most, the position that you left? 
 
JOY LYONS: I’m Joy Medley Lyons, and I worked at Mammoth Cave National Park 
from 1979 until recently, until 2013. Actually July of 2013, and I retired as the chief 
of program services in the division of interpretation. And what else do you want to 
know? 
 
BB: No, that’s good. I’ll [ ].  
 
JL: Okay. Yeah. Okay.  
 
BB: And who are you, sir? 
 
DAVID LYONS: My name is David Lyons, and I actually came kind of through a back 
door to the National Park Service. I’d spent some time in the early ‘70s working with 
the, the Corps of Engineers on several projects in Florida, and, especially in the 
Everglades and lower half of Florida. And you learn a lot about the environment 
through the Corps of Engineers. And it’s not always how things should be. So that’s 
really where I started going back to school I studied, studied plant science, but I 
studied, working summers there for quite some time. And then after the service, I 
came to Kentucky, and actually there was an opening for a seasonal interpreter, and 
that was in ’78, I guess, the winter of the blizzard. I think that was ’78.  
 
JL: Um-hm.  
 
DL: And I, I took that, basically took an intermittent job with the park service. It was 
an interpretive position, which wasn’t really what I knew about, but it, it was, it got 
me in the door, and I actually stayed with the park service until ’80— 
 
JL: Five.  
 
DL: Eighty-five. And when I finished, I’d worked both in resource management, but I 
finished as a, a law enforcement ranger. And there, there were a lot of issues with 
the park service that were hard to deal with in the, it was better that I parted under 
fairly good feelings.  
 
BB: Uh-huh.  
 
DL: So, I, I left that and went to the postal service.  
 
BB: Uh-huh.  
 
DL: And stayed there until 2000— 
 
JL: Until you hit 55, and you were out the door.  
 
DL: Four. Two thousand four I believe, I retired from the postal service.  
 
BB: And what do you do now?  
 
DL: Mostly I just take care of her. No, I do, when I can, a lot of historic preservation 
work, stone, wood, glass, you name it. Just, just about anything you do with old 
houses, we, we kind of do.  
 
BB: Um-hm. 
 
DL: And been, been very fortunate. I get to work in a lot of different places. Of course 
that also means you’re gone a lot, and, and now I can’t really do that.  
 
BB: Right. Joy, how did you come to the, the job in ’78, ’79? 
 
JL: In ’79. Well, let’s see. I was an Owensboro, Kentucky native, and I wound up 
going to Western Kentucky University in ’76, in the Bicentennial year. And the 
summer of ’70-, well, actually the winter of ’78-’79, my roommate, Terry Zurika, who 
was a graduate student in folk studies, actually, back then, under the jurisdiction of 
Lynwood Montell and Burt Finetuck and all that bunch, Cam Collins and all that 
bunch. She came home with an extra application that was, that looked like a census 
form. It was so full of pages and little circles to fill in and what have you. And she 
said, “I’ve got an extra one of these applications for the park service. Do you want 
one?” And I said, “What is it for?” And she said, “Well, this one is for the, a summer 
job at Mammoth Cave.” And I said, “Sure, okay.” So I filled it out. Duh, duh, duh, duh, 
duh.  Took forever. They wanted to know if I could use a chainsaw, they wanted to 
know if I could take, handle money, they wanted to know if I knew much about 
ornithology [0:05:00]. I mean, or-, it was just like everything. It was just, it covered 
every spectrum of the natural and cultural world around us. And I filled it out. And 
luckily I had had a lot of experience working with cash, with money, at previous 
jobs, and Terry unfortunately had not. She worked with museums, and that, really, 
things that had a lot to do with cultural studies, but I was selected to work in the 
ticket office at Mammoth Cave National Park. And poor Terry walked away empty-
handed. But she did get a job the next summer. She did get into the guide force the 
next summer, which was also my first summer in the guide force, in interpretation. 
So my first year on the rolls as a seasonal, I was actually working back in the ticket 
office and I think that was a really good experience because it helped me to have 
empathy, first of all, for the visitors and empathy for the questions they had, you 
know, the things that the guides didn’t necessarily experience. So that when I went 
into the guide force, I was able to show, I think, a little bit more empathy with, with 
the visitors than, than I would have otherwise.  
 
BB: Um-hm.  
 
JL:  Just with their age and concerns that they had, because they would tend to ask 
us the questions in the ticket office about their concerns, physically, and should I 
really take the baby with me on the tour, and I was always like, “Yeah, take that baby 
with you. Go for it.” Whereas the guides would be like, “No! Don’t bring the baby 
with you.”  (laughs) Because nine times out of ten, as soon as they had discovered 
the echo in the cave, they were ‘wah.’ They loved that echo.  
 
BB: What kind of training, what kind of training did you have, having that first 
position, not being interpreter. Did you have some introductory familiarization trips 
into the cave, and how did they work you into that? 
 
JL: We did. We actually had a week of training, which is now two weeks. But we 
went into a week of, the first couple of days were just orientation to the National 
Park Service and Mammoth Cave National Park. You know, where they talked about 
the importance of the uniform and eth-, and ethics. You know, just that type of thing, 
ethics are very, it’s a really big deal in the, in the government and esp-, and in the 
park service. And then, the last three days, they brought in re-hire employees to go 
along with us into the cave on cave tours. So I’m thinking that the ones that we saw 
that year were the Historic Tour, which was two hours, and they took us on the, at 
the time it was the Frozen Niagara tour, but it was an hour and fifteen minutes, and 
you walked in like a quarter of a mile, and back out a quarter of a mile through the 
formations. And the ha-, and at that time, it was the Half-day Tour, which is now 
called the Grand Avenue Tour, and heck, they may be changing that name again too, 
I don’t know. But that was a four and a half hour trip, four miles. And that, and then, 
I think the reason they took the re-hires with us is because they could share 
information with us along the way as we went on the tours, because they took us in 
with regular public. We didn’t do a separate training trip. We were actually in the 
cave with the general public, and at that time, the tours were really big.  
 
BB: So how did you, you two obviously met in the park.  
 
JL: Um-hm.  
 
BB: Or something like that. What’s that, what’s that origin story? Was it the, was it 
about the time you started when you met? 
 
JL: Yeah, the first week we were there.  
 
BB: The first week you were there? 
 
JL: The first week. Um-hm.  
 
BB: Um-hm.  
 
JL: Because he came in I guess on that Wednesday or Thursday, whatever day it was 
that they brought the re-hires back. And I remember I was sitting down in the guide 
lounge, on an old ratty orange sofa, and, that dated back to the 1960s, to Mission ’66. 
Anyway, I looked up as some of the new, some of the re-hires were coming in the 
door, and David was one of them coming in, and I remember looking at him and 
think-, thinking he’s really cute, but I also thought how can he wear his hair that 
long? They don’t let you wear your hair that long here in the uniform, but his hair is 
long. But, and then I remember thinking, I hope he’s not married. So, what’s your 
version? 
 
DL: I don’t remember the first year.  
 
BB: But then you got to know each other through socialization?  
 
JL: We did.  
 
BB: Uh-huh.  
 
JL: We did. Just through getting together at the, at some of the parties and get-
togethers they had at the park. But also the place you really get to know each other 
is in the guide lounge because in between cave tours, lunch time, [0:10:00] there’s 
just a lot of time and opportunity to just, to talk, especially if you’re working with 
somebody on the same schedule that day.  
 
BB: Um-hm.  
 
JL: Because you do all your tours together. You have all of the schedule, the whole 
schedule that day is between the two of you, so that’s what’s kind, one thing that’s 
kind of neat about the guide force is you have the opportunity, depending on who 
you work with, to get to know each other really pretty, I want to say, intimately, 
although that sounds kind of funny to say that about us, because we did get to know 
each other pretty intimately, but we had a lot in common and, and, as most people 
do in that kind of work, you know. And they’re all, we’ve talked before, you and I, 
about the fact that there have been a lot of married couples come out of the National 
Park Service, just because, first of all because of, of common interests, so, and that’s 
probably true in a lot of occupations.  
 
BB: How does that work with married couples? I mean, that, I think that’s one of the 
things that was intriguing about the application, this application, to the Library of 
Congress, because that was one of the things I talked about.  
 
JL: Uh-huh.  
 
DL: It’s very different now, than it was.  
 
BB: Tell me about how, how it was.  
 
DL: Before. Now, the, the interest is, is looking after the couple. They’re, they’re 
basically a team and, and everyone really works with them. Back when we were 
there that was not the case at all. And very typically, if it was a male and female both 
in the park service, it was not the female that was attended to. In fact, when she 
came on to the, the guide force, there were really very few women there at that, that 
time. And it was, it was real, made it really difficult for couples.  
 
BB: Um-hm. 
 
JL: Um-hm. One other things about couples too is just that a lot of our friends wound 
up having to work in different parks to be able to each stay in the National Park 
Service. So sometimes there was a great deal of difference, of distance between them 
geographically, and then, sadly, like, when other people are getting their vacations 
over holidays, park service people don’t tend to take vacations over holidays 
because they’re the ones who are having to work the holidays. That’s where the 
people are coming to. So, so they took atypical time off, you know, at times when, 
when they could get together with their spouses, and each of them would take turns 
moving, you know, going, visiting from one park to the other, and very rarely did 
they get a chance to take off at the same time and go somewhere as a couple or as a 
family. And sometimes it was families that were also separated. With us, you know, 
David and I, I think we had, we, we had some trying times there at the very 
beginning. And when I first started at the park as a woman, I’ll be honest, I think, 
you know, David was saying that, that it’s different now with couples. I truly think 
that part of the reason that it’s different and there’s more empathy and more 
willingness to work with couples is that women came up into the park service, and 
the, there’s just a, there’s a trait within women, who, especially people my age who 
did come up through the hard times in the park service to pay closer attention to 
family, and to pay closer attention to children’s needs, to couple’s needs, and back 
then, in the ‘70s, and certainly in the ‘60s, it was men calling the shots. Nothing 
against men, I like men, but, but they really had a different perspective. First of all, 
they thought women needed to be at home. And they had a hard time accepting 
women coming into the park service, especially in the uniform. And that shows up 
when you look at the early uniforms for women. Oh my gosh, the first women’s 
uniform, I mean, and you need to look for some photographs. Oh my gosh. The first 
women’s uniform looked like a 1960s-era airline stewardess.  
 
DL: Um-hm.  
 
JL: Seriously. With the boots, like, white, I want to say go-go boots. They were just 
boots, skirt, and a different kind of hat, not the Stetson. And then they went, they 
modified from there. And eventually they went into another style. And they finally 
got them into some pants. And then, finally, years, a number of years later, were in 
uniforms [0:15:00] similar to the men’s but with different, a different cut, obviously, 
for women. So, those first uniforms were, I think, I think they were actually an 
embarrassment to the park service. And can you imagine being on the Historic Tour 
on Mammoth Cave going up that tower with a skirt on? And I’m not ta-, and it wasn’t 
a long skirt. It was crazy. I mean, you know, like, above the knee kind of a skirt, well 
above the knee kind of a skirt. It was just ridiculous. And then that, and, and we’re 
talking Mammoth Cave. What if you worked at Yellowstone? What if you worked at 
Grand Canyon? I mean, and you’re out in the elements, and that’s what they’ve got 
you in? Just ridiculous.  
 
BB: When, when you started in the late ‘70s, what was the issue at that time? 
 
JL: At that time, the issue was pretty much what it is right now. We didn’t have 
pockets on the backside of the pants, then. We do now. I always remember saying to 
the girls at work, “The last thing I need on my butt is a, is two pockets to draw 
attention to it.” But, but we, we had pretty much the same uniform. And it’s not, it’s 
not changed that much in the last 30 years, truly. What’s changed is the producers 
or, you know, who, who creates the uniform, whereas before in the ‘70s, it was 
pretty much all American-made— 
 
DL: Um-hm.  
 
JL: Products and especially the boots, and the hiking gear, that kind of stuff, and now 
almost all of it is foreign-made. It’s, you know, internationally made, so, and that’s 
something that doesn’t sit well with a lot of the people who work for the park 
service. And, and the sizing is different than it used to be too, because, I think 
partially because things are made in other countries. The quality’s not as good as it 
used to be.  
 
BB: Um-hm.  
 
DL: The— 
 
JL: But they’re more expensive. 
 
DL: The attitude with, with women didn’t stop with co-workers and, you know, 
management. It was really a pub-, a, the, the same thing with a lot of the public. And 
I can’t tell you the number of times I’ve heard someone ask if, “Are you a member of 
the ranger auxiliary?”  
 
JL: Yeah.  
 
DL: Or “Are you the guide’s helper?” or you, you know.  
 
JL: Yeah, “I bet he’s taught you a lot over the years.” And then the guide, the guide up 
front, you know, like, you know, the, the lead guide and the trailing guide. Well, if it 
was your turn to trail the trip and not lead it, people would say, “I bet you’ve learned 
a lot from him over the years.” I’m like, “Well, no, not really, because he just started 
in May and I’m helping train him.” You know, that kind of stuff.  
 
DL: Yeah, it, it was, it’s a shock. It was a shock to— 
 
JL: They always assumed that the man had been here longer, had been there longer. 
And there was a time when, yeah, that was definitely true, and when they’d come to 
the information desk, it was usually the men that they’d come up to first. Even if you 
were there, like if there were two women and one man working the information 
desk, and the two women were standing there with no one there, they would stand 
in line and wait behind somebody to talk to the guys, instead of just going over to 
the ladies. So we would be assertive and, and say, “Can we help you with anything?” 
Well, no, well, they’ll look and, you know, just point at the guy. I’m like, “No, it’s okay. 
We, we can answer whatever questions you’ve got. It’s fine.” You know, you just, you 
just roll with the punches. You just got used to it, and, and took care of it. Amish. 
Mm. Now, those we just said, “”Phft. They’re going to wait.” Nobody, and sometimes 
the Mennonites too, because they wouldn’t come up and talk to the women. And the 
women in the group didn’t come up and talk to anybody. But they did enjoy the cave. 
They enjoyed the cave tours. If you went up and talked to them, if you approached 
them and spoke to them, they would respond. They were fine. But it was in that, in 
that setting, the men would come forward and get the information and that sort of 
thing. Which, I don’t know much about Amish. You probably would know more 
about the Amish than I do, or Mennonites, but that was kind of the trait, that was my 
experience with them.  
 
BB: Hm. So you did a lot of training yourself about gender, during the time.  
 
JL: Um-hm.  
 
BB: And teaching, teaching the public about— 
 
JL: Oh, yeah.  
 
BB: Changing roles in American working life.  
 
JL: Definitely. Yes. Yes. You know, now they have women’s studies. And there’s also, 
I’ve often thought I could have a good time going and doing some ta-, on-site talks 
with people, you know who teach women’s studies. I’ve just not done it yet. But 
that’s the kind of thing I’d like to do is just to get out, and I’ve always enjoyed the 
academic environment anyway. So maybe at some point that’s something that I can 
do.  
 
BB: Um-hm.  
 
JL: At least talk with them.  
 
BB: When you all met, I guess what, also I’m curious about the, you know, of course, 
the working lives. What was it like the, the places you lived in housing on site? Can 
you explain— 
 
JL: Um-hm.  
 
BB: Explain to me how that evolved over the years [0:20:00] and, or how you started 
and what was that environment like that, was that another piece of getting close to 
one another after hours, and was there, was it communal eating or was it communal 
socializing and— 
 
JL: That’s a good question. One thing that was really common because it was a 
national park, and it’s true in a lot of national parks that are even more isolated than 
Mammoth Cave, the NPS community would come together in the evenings 
sometimes to have pot lucks and celebrate birthdays or what-have-you, because a 
lot of times they were so far from towns, you know, that you, your, your community 
was like your own little small, small city. So that’s who you depended on for your 
socializing and your entertainment. Anyway, David and I, we, we participated in 
things like that over at the seasonal housing and the permanent housing, the 
housing circle at Mammoth Cave was built in the, by the CCC, so they’re historic 
structures, and we’ve got, one of the CCC houses was across the river, called Maple 
Springs, and then Mission ‘66 brought seasonal apartments to the mix. I guess 
before that, seasonals had to camp. I don’t know what they did. But, so we got three 
buildings over there with four apartments in each building. And one bedroom in 
each apartment. So you have two people of the same gender, unless they’re married, 
living over in those seasonal apartments. We lived, beginning, after we got married 
in September of ’81 over at the Mammoth Cave Baptist Church, in Mammoth Cave 
National Park, we wound up living at Maple Springs because David was in law 
enforcement, and he for all intents and purposes was the North side, North district 
ranger. And so we had au-, we had mandatory housing. He had to live in the park. 
And part of that we had lived outside the park in Cave City for just a few months 
before we got married, and then got married in September, moved into Maple 
Springs in October, and that’s where we lived from October of ’81 until January of 
’86. And I loved it. Loved living over there. It was very isolated, which was, but 
isolation is not necessarily a bad thing for a young married couple. We did have a 
campground down the road from us that sometimes caused us to have visitors at the 
place, well, you know, at the house. They, they would think it was a ranger station, 
like an office, so people would stop by there.  
 
DL: Our, our heat was a wood stove, and campers would come and steal our 
firewood.  
 
JL: (laughs) Yeah, quite frequently. And when you’re talking about a boy scout troop, 
they can haul off some wood. And we were having to basically pay for our firewood. 
You know we were buying it. We weren’t—we could go out and get some downed 
deadwood in the park, but good grief, you’d, that’d take forever, so we were buying 
ricks of wood for our fireplace. And we, that was our primary and only heat source 
really. I mean, we had fuel oil.  
 
DL: When it worked.  
 
JL: Right. But we didn’t really use it that much. But the house itself was, had an attic 
space, and two original bedrooms, a living room and a kitchen. And a basement, and 
then sometime in the ‘60s I think they added on another small bathroom and a little 
bedroom. And the garage, I think, might have been original, and then kind of became 
an attachment to the house— 
 
DL: Yeah. I think so, yeah.  
  
JL: When they added on. Lots of stonework, of course. The typical NPS architectural 
style. But David and I had really memorable years there. Our daughter, Becca, was 
born while we lived there. She was born in June of ’84, and so it’s one of my favorite 
places in the park. As a matter of fact, I can’t usually go over there and drive by 
without getting a little teary-eyed, because it’s like— 
 
DL: Doesn’t look the same anymore. 
 
JL: No, it doesn’t look the same at all anymore, especially the roadway. When we 
lived over there, the road was single lane, and should have really been one way, but 
it was a two-way road.  
 
BB: The North outer park road? 
 
JL: Yes. Well, not—yeah, actually, because the main road that you just drove in on 
this morning, across to the ferry when you were coming back from Paul, Paul Rich’s 
house? 
 
BB: Um-hm.  
 
JL: It was hard to pass. It was gravel. And then it went to, what do you call that hard-
packed stuff?  
 
DL: That would chip and seal? 
 
JL: Yeah, the chip and seal stuff. And then they finally, years later, widened it a little 
bit and, and paved it. But when we lived there, you were out in God’s country. And 
then when you took the left to go [0:25:00] where Maple Springs was, it was even 
narrower, kind of went along the edge of a big sinkhole and on back to Maple 
Springs campground, but where we lived, we had the h-, the house and a barn, and 
there was an old stone building back there. And other people have used it since. Not 
for, well, but some, a few people have used it since we moved out to live there. You 
know, a couple people like Eddie Wells, and two other people that I can think of, but 
who are no longer at the park. But we also had a dog that showed up like two days 
after we moved into the park. It was a lab mix. His name was Beau. We named him. 
We figured if he found us, we needed him. And so we had him there for about four 
years. Matter of fact, he died out in the barn in November, right before we moved in 
January. It was a horrendous experience.  
 
DL: Yes, it was.  
 
JL: It was. We, we loved that dog.  
 
BB: Hm.  
 
JL: David and I were just talking about it the other day. We were like, we’ve had two 
dogs in our lives that we will never forget. Beau was one, and then another one was 
Mickey, and I was like, and she was an Australian shepherd, and I was like, but we 
only had three dogs. That doesn’t make Lady sound very good. She was a Dalmatian. 
But we didn’t have her as long, and that dog was wild. But yeah, we’ve had some, we 
love pets, we love animals, obviously, so.  
 
BB: So that was kind of atypical—was that atypical of the, this, it seems like a good 
situation you two were in.  
 
JL: It was. We, but with the mandatory housing, we had some issues sometimes. Like 
they told us we had to have a telephone. Well, the phone line over there that ran 
over to Maple Springs only ran over there for Maple Springs. It was miles of phone 
line, blah, blah, blah. And the phone bill was $90 a month.  
 
DL: Back then— 
 
JL: We were like, yeah, and we’re talking 1980— 
 
BB: Nineteen-eighty-two dollars.  
 
JL: Yeah. Ninety dollars. We were like, “No, we don’t want a phone.” “You have to 
have a phone.” “No we don’t.” “You have to have a phone, dear. You know, David has 
to have a phone.” “If you’re saying he has to have a phone, then you pay for it, 
because we’re not going to.” We paid our rent. We’re talking, our rent was $300 a 
month.  
 
DL: Which was considerably higher than anything surrounding the park.  
 
JL: Right and, and was the highest—actually Maple Springs, other than the 
superintendent’s house, was the highest rated rent— 
 
DL: Yeah.  
 
JL: In the park because it was the second largest house in the park, other than the 
superintendent’s house, which was over on the, well, off the circle, but I, you’ve seen 
it, I think. You know which one I’m talking about. Yeah.  
 
DL: God, that’s a chunk when you’re making what, $17,000 a year.  
 
JL: Yeah, yeah, we were not making a lot of money. And I think that was a primary 
reason that David left the park service, too, is just the money issue. He left he park 
service and went straight to almost, what, three dollars an hour more at the post 
office? 
 
DL: Oh, I doubled my salary in the first few.  
 
JL: Crazy. And I was glad to have it, but we had to, when he left the park service 
though, we had to leave Maple Springs, so, because that was mandatory housing for 
the ranger, law enforcement ranger. I worked at the park, but I was not law 
enforcement. I was interpretation. So David, we came over here and bought this 
piece of property right here, and went and got a log house kit. Basically ordered a 
log house. They put up the shell, and then David built literally everything else in 
here over the years. Some things have not even actually been finished yet, but a lot 
of it we do as we can, you know, as we can afford it. It’s a work in progress. And, but 
we miss, I miss Maple Springs. It’s just, it was near and dear to my heart.  
 
BB: Um-hm.  
 
JL: I even asked Rebecca, and she doesn’t really remember it. She remembers Beau. 
And, and at the backdoor, because she would go to the back door and talk to him 
through the glass, you know, when she was little, but she, and she does, she says she 
remembers that. I guess she does, because I don’t remember ever telling her about 
it, so. Sometimes you have young memories.  
 
BB: Hm. So tell me a little bit about the working environment when you, I mean, 
you’ve seen a lot because you were there for quite a few years.  
 
JL: Um-hm.  
 
BB: And you know, David, certainly you can chime in about your experiences, but 
what about the, how does it go? How does work go in the park? How, how do people 
treat one another? How do they learn from one another? How do you pass things 
on? Is there a philosophy, either a personal or, or something that’s stated by the 
park service that, you know— 
 
JL: Well, yeah, obviously there are standard operating procedures, and each cave 
tour, for instance has standard operating procedures for what you’re supposed to 
do, how you do it, written up. Those are actually written by the staff. So at— 
[0:30:00] 
 
[INTERRUPTION—RECORDING STOPS] 
 
JL: Okay.  
 
BB: Go ahead.  
 
JL: So I would ask some of the staff, “Okay, you guys, you two, work on this SOP. 
Really look at it. Look at how we need to do this cave tour. Tell, look at things that 
have been issues for us. Give me what, let me see what you get, what you got.” And 
so a lot of things changed when we brought the staff into the mix for making 
decisions about what the tours are going to be named or how, what routes we’re 
going to, how the route needs to be changed, how many stops do we need to make. I 
mean, that was not the case years ago. Years ago, it was by the book, you don’t 
change the book, you don’t reinterpret the book. You do what it says. And everybody 
was worried about timing on cave tours. And nowadays, we just tell people, look, the 
tour’s two hours. We want to get in and we want to get out in two hours, but the 
problem, the thing is, that can’t be your driving force. If you have somebody on the 
tour that’s having difficulty, that’s your priority. You don’t push them and get them 
out in two hours, you know. So there were some things that over the years have 
become more visitor-focused, visitor-friendly I think. And also more, and more 
employee-focused and employee-friendly so that they have, I like to believe anyway, 
more voice in what’s decided and how things happen, because they’re the ones who 
live it, they’re the ones who, who have to deal with what’s going on, like with the 
white-nose syndrome at the park right now. It doesn’t make sense for people in 
management in another office to decide how that’s going to work, or decide what 
needs to be changed. You don’t know. They’re out there doing it. So they, the people 
who are doing the job can come to you and feel free to make suggestions. You may 
have another, you may have some insight that they don’t know, that you share with 
them and say, “You know, I would like to be able to do it that way, but if we do, then 
this is going to happen.” And so you just have this back and forth discussion. We 
were talking with, like Joel Gillespie, he was one of my favorite people to bounce 
things off of because Joel is very, he’s a thinker. And he’ll, he would say to me, “Let 
me think about that. I’ll come back to you.” And then he’d come, we’d talk about it. 
And I knew that he would. I knew that he would give it some thought. I knew he 
would come back. And he wasn’t the only one, certainly. There are many others who 
are the same way, Johnny Meredith, Chuck DuCroix, Leslie Price. She’s a real deep 
thinker. Sometimes, and, and Kathy, of course, Kathy Proffit, she’d be in my office. 
We all worked together. It was kind of like a think tank. But, but even though we 
were the higher graded, like I was a GS12, Kathy’s a GS11, and the other f-, the other 
ones I mentioned, they’re GS9s. Then you jump down to the guide force, to people 
who deal everyday with the stress and the emergency things, and even deaths in the 
cave, are GS5s, which is not high enough.  
 
DL: Uh-uhn.  
 
JL: The park service is a diffi-, has a real problem with under-graded staff. Too much 
responsibility for their pay. But they do it.  
 
DL: More so now. 
 
JL: You’re, you’re right. And they, but they do it. They get the job done regardless 
and some people will say, “Well, you government folks get paid in benefits.” And 
that’s partially true. I know you get, you know, you get your sick leave, and you get 
vacation time off, supposedly, but, but management can tell you, “No, you can’t take 
that time off because we’re busy that week. You’re going to have to wait until a 
slower week.” 
 
DL: I think it’s probably a little different now, but when, with me, from April through 
early November, there was no vacation. You didn’t do it. You didn’t even ask for it.  
 
JL: Back then, no. It’s not true now. But back then, that was definitely the case.  
 
DL: Yeah, but— 
 
JL: And partly it was because of staffing numbers, too, I think.  
 
DL: Well, yeah.  
 
JL: And sometimes, I think it was just because of orneriness on the supervisor’s part.  
 
DL: Could be.  
 
BB: What would you, maybe, maybe November, you were, you were on duty. Where 
would, where would somebody like, rangers like yourselves, where, where, where 
would you take time off? What would you do on time off? 
 
JL: What did we do? 
 
DL: I think one of the favorite things that, that we did was just drive, just get away.  
 
JL: From the park. And even if it wasn’t an overnight thing, we would, both David 
and I both have always enjoyed just driving and seeing the country. And visiting 
little po-dunk places. We never were, I’m not saying we didn’t go places like 
Charleston, South Carolina, we did. I love that place. We mentioned that earlier, off 
camera. But we would go to Red River Gorge, places like that, to camp. That’s where 
I felt, [0:35:00] realized that I was pregnant with Becca because we got down on a 
hiking trail, and we got down to the very bottom of this ravine, and I was like, I got 
to walk back up out of this ravine, and I was so wiped out. I said, “David, I’ve got to 
be pregnant. I have got no juice left in me at all.” And sure enough, I was. I was, that 
was kind of a strange situation, yeah, to realize my body’s not going to get me out of 
here very easily today, whereas before I would have had no trouble with it 
whatsoever. Where else did we travel to? We didn’t have a whole lot of money to 
travel much. We went to Michigan. We, we’d go to see family in Owensboro.  
 
DL: Went to East-, Eastern Kentucky a lot.  
 
JL: We did go to Eastern Kentucky a lot. Breaks Interstate Park. And then just all 
over Eastern Kentucky, honestly. Especially down in the lower Eastern part, 
Cumberland Gap Nation-, you know, Historic Site. And we went to Big South Fork, 
took the kids on the train.  
 
BB: But parks.  
 
JL: The parks. But not necessarily, yeah, and some state, oh, we, state parks. We 
went to a lot of Kentucky state parks.  
 
DL: We did. 
 
JL: And we would sometimes stay overnight at those. Actually, we usually did stay 
overnight at the state parks, like Cumberland Falls. Actually, that’s where David 
proposed to me was Cumberland Falls. And then the, we, yeah, we, the early days, 
that’s where we went really was Eastern Kentucky. You’re right. I never sat back and 
thought about it, but that’s where we tended to go to most.  
 
DL: We did.  
 
BB: Did you guide together? Guide cave tours together? 
 
JL: We went on cave tours, I think I can remember twice, and I wouldn’t guide either 
one of them. I made him guide and I trailed, because I was embarrassed to guide in 
front of him. I don’t know why, I just was. I didn’t want to do it. So he did. We had 
two very different styles of guiding. And it’s like David has got this very slow 
methodical, every sentence that comes out of his mouth, it sounds like he’s thinking 
about it. Whereas I was just the jabberwocky, duh-duh, duh-duh, duh-duh, duh-duh, 
you know, but, I mean, I had the information in my head, but I would just keep, I just, 
I felt like, I think really it was more I just wanted to hear him. I just wanted to see 
him in front of a group and listen to him because he’s usually more of a listener than 
a talker, and I didn’t get the opportunity much to see him in the cave. We, the off-, 
they really made a point of not pairing us together, and once they realized there was 
a relationship there, and then see, when he went into law enforcement, well, and 
that was really fairly so-, like, what, a year and a half later, something like that?  
 
DL: It wasn’t even that.  
 
JL: We didn’t have the opportunity to go in the cave together except for when, when 
I was in the cave on a tour and we had a carryout or something like that. And then 
law enforcement and maintenance guys got called in to help carry somebody out of 
the cave because they gave out or got sick or, heaven forbid, passed away, which did 
happen some. And I remember working one fatality with David, outside the cave.  
 
BB: Tell me about that.  
 
JL: A road accident. I’d rather he talk about that one.  
 
BB: Okay. That’s fine. Or not, yeah, right now. 
 
JL: No, you can talk about it, it’s [ ].  
 
BB: Can you tell me about law enforce-, you know you switched to law enforcement, 
and what that was like, and then maybe, I know you’ve been away for a while, but 
maybe how you perceive it to be today, or was there differences, or maybe share 
some stories about it.  
 
DL: No, there was, there was definitely a, a difference now. Now the park service 
actually admits they have law enforcement people.  
 
JL: Yeah.  
 
DL: And they pay them as such to work under hazardous duty pay and, and— 
 
JL: And buy them gear.  
 
DL: Yeah, and buy them gear. We had to buy our own gear. And if, if we were 
somewhere in the park and went into a public building, we had to strip all weapons. 
We could not carry a weapon into a public building.  
 
JL: The hotel, for instance.  
 
DL: Yeah, even the hotel to eat lunch. You couldn’t, couldn’t do it. And— 
 
JL: Locked them in the trunk, or wherever.  
 
DL: It was, well, very different time. Even the road patrols were restricted as to what 
you could do. And of course, it, it— 
 
JL: You could talk about some of those restrictions. Why not? 
 
DL: Unless somebody was, there were no speeding tickets written in the park then, 
unless somebody was running—I, I think probably maybe the two or three that I did 
write were, one was a Corvette that I clocked at, what was it, 98 miles an hour on 
the radar.  
 
JL: Gee.  
 
DL: And— 
 
JL: Look out deer, here I come.  
 
DL: And he did get a ticket, [0:40:00] and we got by with it. But a lot of them were 
written, would be thrown out by your supervisors. So it, it really got to the point that 
what’s the use in, in writing them? It’s not going to get past your immediate 
supervisor. And even other things like tremendous amount of poaching went on 
during winter. And— 
 
JL: Especially on the North side where we lived.  
 
DL: Very often they were known people. And we knew where they were taking the 
deer, where they were processing them. But our supervisors would never allow us 
to do anything about it. If you caught one in the act, or two, you could maybe get it to 
court. But not very often. I think the only time that we had that, two actually we got 
into court. One was the, we stopped the car just a few minutes after a shot, and the, 
and the rear of the car was covered in blood. I mean, all over it. And our direct 
supervisor called and said for one of us to stand there with the car and the other go 
get a search warrant. And we’re, what, 40 miles from a search warrant, in the middle 
of, two o’clock in the morning. But fortunately, at that time, another supervisor 
drove up, and he looked at the blood on it, and, and he said, “Open the trunk.” And 
we, we did. They had a trunk full of weapons, and a trunk full of deer. So, and 
honestly, the only reason they went to court is another supervisor had shown up, 
and we did damage to the car. That’s the only reason it went to, to, to court. And the 
other incident— 
 
JL: You did damage when you opened the trunk? 
 
DL: Yeah. And the other was we stopped a, what appeared to be a fellow going 
fishing but they had the tailgate was down in the back of the truck, and there was 
blood dripping off the tailgate, and there were two johnboats in the back of the, the 
truck, and anyway, we, I, I stopped the car, and went to the truck, and the fellow who 
was with me, that was actually in training at the time, went around to the other side 
of the truck and just as he got up close to the truck, someone moved under one of 
the boats, and there were two guys under the boats, both boats, with their deer that 
they had shot, holding guns pointed at, at both of us. And that one, because of the 
guns and the fact that they were pointing went to court. But very, very few went to 
court. Very often the poachers were people who worked for the park service.  
 
JL: Or had.  
 
DL: Or had.  
 
BB: So is that it, it’s saving image, or why do you think prosecution was— 
 
DL: It, it was— 
 
JL: Well, you’re talking about some early supervisors who actually grew up in the 
area, and a lot of the folks that David’s talking about— 
 
DL: They were family.  
 
JL: Some of them were. But, I mean, over, well, I don’t want to stereotype.  
 
DL: No.  
 
JL: But there are families, you know, that have gotten, just, you can wind up with a 
third cousin, you can wind up with whoever. And, and when you’re talking about a 
park where most of the original rangers started out from the area, you couldn’t 
throw a rock without hitting somebody that was kin to somebody at the park or who 
was, you know, dis-, at least distant, or an in-law, or an out-law, or whatever.  So that 
made a big difference. And you’re talking about from 1941, for a person to retire 
with 30 years, they’re going to go at least, you know, ’71. So, and, and usually longer. 
The guys would, tended to work longer than that. So you tended to get into the ‘70s 
with people who are still related to, you know, who are related to some of the very 
first rangers at Mammoth Cave. And they didn’t want to, you know, it wasn’t 
necessarily that they wanted to get their family in hot water, especially when, at that 
time, even if, still in the ‘70s, bad feelings were still running over the park being 
established, because you still had that memory, that generation, that first generation 
memory of being moved off the park. Not so much now. [0:45:00] Now we’re getting 
into, now we’re into second, and third, and fourth generation, and [ ]— 
 
DL: Very often— 
 
JL: And being told about it, but not necessarily living through it.  
 
DL: Very often then, promotions were not made because of anyone’s ability. They 
were made because, well, this, this is still my cousin over here, and this is where he 
needs to be, and, and that’s how you promoted, and, and sometimes those people 
were just— 
 
JL: Yeah.  
 
DL: What you couldn’t call sharp.  
 
JL: But not every ranger in the park had that local connection.  
 
DL: No, they didn’t. 
 
JL: And, and some, it was honestly the ones who came in without the local 
connection or with, I don’t want to say it, but with college education, who would 
come in, and were a little bit more worldly, handled things differently. They had a 
bigger perspective of life.  
 
DL: And it took a long time.  
 
JL: And the job. Yeah. And, I mean, you know, people think, oh, nothing ever happens 
out in Mammoth Cave. But they do. I mean, you have accidents. You have road 
accidents.  
 
DL: People also go to national parks to do things that they would never do anywhere 
else. They come to commit suicide. They, you know, they, they, they come to national 
parks to do things that just are not going to happen in other places.  
 
JL: Didn’t we had a guy up on top of the road or something one time, who committed 
suicide or was there to commit suicide and you were the one who found him? 
 
DL: No, that’s his wife was there to kill him.  
 
JL: Oh, I forgot. Got my, got my stories mixed up on that one. But we did have, we 
have road, you know, fatalities, and I do remember, right after Becca was born and I 
had just gone back to work at the campground. I was supervising the campground at 
the time, because I had a split position where I worked six months in the cave 
interpreting, and six months outside supervising the campground. And I enjoyed 
that position quite a bit, actually, especially, and then I had a two-month furlough, 
which I didn’t enjoy because I wasn’t getting paid, but it was nice to be off with the 
baby. Well, right after I got back to work in September, after she was born, there was 
a call that there’d been a, a motor vehicle accident on Flint Ridge Road. And all of the 
law enforcement guys were across the river, pan-, painting boundary. So they were 
all out in their snake gear, and their tick gear, and everything else, because you’re 
out in the woods painting trees and what have you. It was going to take a while for 
them to get there. The only ranger on duty on the South side was David. So they left 
one person over to handle everything that happened on, during the day. And so a 
girl named Barbara Montgomery and I got, got in our truck, because we were really 
the only responders was us and David, and he needed backup. Well, we were his 
back up, God bless him. So we get down there, and the truck, the car that was there 
was, I saw, I remember getting there and seeing a guy and a girl sitting over on the 
side, and both of them were obviously very distraught. And I was like, “Well, where’s 
David? I see his cruiser, but where is he?” And then about that time, I see him raise 
up out of the car, and he was basically in there verifying that the young lady who 
was in her early 20s was deceased. So— 
 
DL: It was sad, too, because just a, what, a couple of years before that, I had her in 
the YECC program.  
 
JL: YECC program, yeah. She was one of the, she worked in that YECC program. And 
her uncle worked at the park.  
 
DL: Yeah.  
 
JL: So he showed up, not knowing who was in the accident.  
 
BB: Um.  
 
JL: Yeah, so he showed up, and he looked at me, he said, “Joy,” you know, I was 
standing there holding traffic, but he walked up to me, and he said, “That’s my 
nephew over there,” and we had a blanket around him because he was in shock. And 
he said, [ ] “Who’s in there?” I said, “Well, his sister’s in there.” And he said, “Oh, 
that’s my niece.” I said, “I’m sorry, Morris, but she’s gone.” I mean, I had to tell, he 
wanted to know. He said, “Oh God, I got to, I need to get over to my sister.” So he 
went to get some information from other people, because I said, “I’m not the one you 
need to talk to.” And by the time he got there, though, to his sister’s house to tell her 
about her daughter, the chief ranger had called and told her, which is really not— 
 
DL: Not the way to do it.  
 
JL: Not the way to do it, I don’t think. It’s the way, it’s not the way to do it now, but at 
that time, it was easier for him just to make the phone call, even though the lady’s 
last name was the same as one of our maintenance foreman. He st-, I don’t think he 
made the connection. And in that, and in this, in your area, you should make the 
connection that there’s a chance they’re kin to each other.  
 
DL: At that time, he didn’t make a lot of connections. And he, yeah, [0:50:00] he, he 
kind of missed his retirement for about [ ] years.  
 
JL: Yeah, sometimes people go over a little bit young-, longer than they should. Yeah. 
So there’s, there are tragedies like that that, that happened. And they, you know, 
you, you go on with them. But we don’t, I know that there are other parks that have 
far more of them than we do.  
 
BB: That’s what I was going to ask. Is this a typical thing that Mammoth has so 
much— 
 
JL: No, but I’m not going to play down what the guys have to deal with every day.  
They deal with a lot more than what’s, that I know, than I know about, or anyone 
else ever knew about because when you’re investigating, or you’re running, you 
know, something, you don’t tell everybody about it. So those guys get out and they 
do their thing, and they talk about it amongst themselves, but, so they’re this little 
isolated community, that the rest of us look at like, they think they’re, but not really. 
And, and they, and some of them are better at breaking that barrier than others. But, 
and it, and it helped for me that I had worked out in resource management and law 
enforcement. That’s what I s-, that’s what I mean, like, when you spread yourself 
around in the park, which is what I did, but also it’s what helped me get up and not, 
get up in the ranks in one park. I didn’t, I didn’t just sit in one position all the time at 
one grade level. I was more than willing to try something new and get out and do 
that. So you know, you get people who are not so willing, and they get complacent, 
but yet, they’re griping about the fact that they’re not getting what they want. Well, 
you know what, do something. You do it. You be assertive, and you show people 
what you can do. We were talking about women earlier, you know, in, in the park 
service. And I don’t want, I think it would be unfair to leave this interview thinking 
that women all stuck together, and women always supported one another, because 
that’s not true. You know, we found, one thing that I had trouble with in the park 
service was cliques within the women, within the female group. And it tended to be 
between office women versus ranger women. Office staff versus the women in the 
uniform. And some of the office women were in uniform, but it was between, but it 
was different work classes. So the ladies who worked in the office tended to 
sometimes hold, have problems with those of us who had authority within the park. 
They liked to talk about, sometimes about us getting authority in the wrong way, 
and they talked about the fact that we are graded too high, and they needed to be 
graded higher. You know, it was about money.  
 
DL: Which is really odd, because most office workers were graded higher than 
rangers.  
 
JL: They are now. They weren’t before, but they are now. No, there are people in the 
office, the ladies who run, that work in the office with their Monday-Friday work 
schedules and their typing and that sort of stuff, and they do more than that, but, us-, 
most of them are GS7s, whereas my staff were GS5s and had to work weekends and 
holidays and—so there’s that issue. Not al-, the women are not always as supportive 
of each other. And it sounds like I’m s-, I’m sour grapes right now, too, just about 
that. I was, because I was, it was so regrettable. Why can’t everybody support each 
other? Why can’t you celebrate each other’s successes instead of looking down your 
nose at someone who got an upgrade or thinking that because they’re a supervisor 
they just don’t understand what we do anymore? You know, and some of these 
people I had been friends with since the beginning, but I moved up, and they had 
trouble with that, that there had to be some reason that I moved up. There was even 
one rumor, I don’t know if you knew this or not, George Gregory told me once that 
there was a rumor going around that I was having an affair with Ron Switzer.  
 
DL: Really? 
 
JL: Yeah. If I was going to have an affair, it sure wasn’t going to be with Ron Switzer. 
He was our superintendent. (laughs) I was like, “What?!” No. Like, look at David. 
Look at Ron Switzer. No. Not going to happen.  
 
BB: So it would be nice if everybody could celebrate, you know, [ ]— 
 
JL: Yeah, exactly, celebrate each other’s, each other’s successes. Why not? 
 
BB: What are some things that you, as, either as an interpreter or law enforcement 
that you really celebrate. You, maybe a story you felt good about, the way something 
turned out, or— 
 
JL: Oh.  
 
BB: Some advice you’ve given. [0:55:00] Somebody or a feedback you got, or, from a 
staff or from a public— 
 
JL: I, well, that big book right there, next to you, has a little bit of that. That’s from my 
retirement dinner. And it’s just some things that people wrote, you know, about 
ways that I helped them, and ways that I impacted their life. I have almost 200 cards 
that were sent to me for my birthday this year. And I’m, a lot of the, a lot of the staff 
would, wrote in them ways that I had made a difference in their lives. Things that I 
hadn’t even thought about, but I guess what I, the things that I take most pride in is 
the mentoring that I did with the staff. Breaking barriers between supervisors and 
the front line, making it more invisible, you know, like breaking, it’s not a glass 
ceiling, it was a glass wall, and getting, getting people where we could all be on the 
say wave-, wavelength and talking. But also, I think I’m proudest of, as far as, as far 
as my accomplishments, of research, you know just starting to do original research 
at the park. That was not happening much at all when I got there. There were a 
couple of people who did a little bit, and they happened to be guys who went to law 
enforcement later on, like Henry and you and David. And I started researching 
African-American history and other things as well, as, and things outside the park. I 
sort of pushed the history of the parks’ boundaries, and got involved with Bell’s 
Tavern out here at Park City and the connection between that and Mammoth Cave, 
which nobody knew, really, and nobody talked about. And then I got so excited 
about it, and telling stories to people, and David of course, was always involved in 
that too. They, it rubbed off on them. So now I’ve got staff who, well, they’re not my 
staff anymore, but I still consider them my staff. But they dig deep into everything. 
Everyone of them has decide-, you know, I’m like, “If you want to keep your job, if 
you want to make sure that you stay here, you’re not in a rift, if you want to make 
sure that you got a place here, that you get a job promotion, make yourself 
indispensible. Make yourself the go-to guy, the go-to girl for something, at least one 
thing, but preferably more than one. And that way, somebody’s going to go, ‘Well, 
oh, shoot though, if I put her over here, if I get her, if I give her a furlough, that 
means for one or two months, we’re not going to have this being done.’” So that was, 
that kind of guidance that I would give them. A lot of folks that I helped start in the 
park service have gone on into other places in the park service and gone up. One of 
them was Tim Cash. I don’t claim credit for Tim Cash. That actually goes more to Joe 
McGowan, who’s now deceased, but Tim started out as a student aid at Mammoth 
Cave, and he’s now a GS14 in, out of Washington, but he lives in Glasgow and travels 
back and forth. And that’s the, not something that would have happened before, but 
his family’s in Glasgow. So he lives in Glasgow three weeks of the y-, month, and he 
works from home, and then for a week of the month, he has to be in DC, so he does 
that travel back and forth. That would never have happened before, because that’s 
some money, you know. And Laura Peppers, she started out as a student aid, and I 
helped her through a lot of things, and now, she just came back to Mammoth Cave 
National Park from Eastern Parks, as the chief of, the chief ranger, the new chief 
ranger. And I don’t know if you’ve interviewed Laura yet, but you might want to 
think about Laura Peppers. She would be a good story.  
 
BB: She’s coming on as chief of— 
 
JL: Chief of law enforcement and visitor services, or whatever they’re calling it now.   
 
BB: I talked to the acting— 
 
JL: Visitor protection.  
 
BB: Chief a couple of weeks ago, so I knew that she was coming in, but I didn’t know 
her name.  
 
JL: Uh-huh. Yeah, Laura, Laura Peppers. Great girl.  
 
BB: That’s a big deal.  
 
JL: It’s a very big deal.  
 
BB: In our world here with— 
 
JL: Yeah. And of course our superintendent, Sarah Craighead, but she’s on detail 
right now in Atlanta. And she started at Mammoth Cave as well, but I didn’t, I had 
nothing to do with that. She did everything on that. That’s her. That’s all her.  
 
DL: No comment.  
 
JL: But the law enforcement, you know, people who, I didn’t have anything to help 
with, with those guys. They, they do their thing. But the thing is too, though, some of 
the people, like David Alexander, in law enforcement started in— 
 
[INTERRUPTION—RECORDING STOPS] 
 
JL: I think I can carry that one [1:00:00] into. Yeah, David Alexander we were 
speaking of before. He started so young at the park. And he started in interpretation. 
But he always wanted to do law enforcement. And he guided cave tours for a long, 
quite a while, but he was, most people who was local, who had a dream, who wanted 
to move forward, wanted to work at the park, he wanted to work for the National 
Park Service, and I’m not sure, but I think maybe at one time, he would have been 
happy to have worked somewhere else, but he’s made all of us so proud with being 
on the honor guard, the national honor—oh my gosh, that’s such honor. It’s, and, it’s 
such, it’s just so important, and it speaks so highly of David and Mammoth Cave 
National Park. I just can’t say enough about how special that is that he did that. But 
having said that, I also remember that David Alexander, who went into a cave tour 
on a trog tour with a sea-, another seasonal in training named Katina Buster. She’d 
been there for quite a while, but she was just learning to trog, the cave tour for the 
kids, and he lost her on the tour. (laughs) So I remember that David Alexander as 
well, as well. He had, you know, the kids with him. I don’t remember how many they 
had. But somehow or other, Katina didn’t stay up with him, and she wound up lost 
on the trog route. So he comes out, and we had to go back in and look—actually 
Henry Holman had to go in looking for her with David, and they found her. She was 
(gasps) blubbering, and then they brought her back up to the—I don’t think she was 
crying in the cave, but she started crying after they found her, from nerves. And 
anyway, so the next day, I remember watching him come in from the parking lot to 
work and he was carrying a red rose with the little water bubble thing at the end, 
you know. He was, he’d brought a rose in for Katina because he felt so bad that he’d 
lost her in the cave. Actually she lost herself.  
 
BB: Right.  
 
JL: But he’s a really good guy.  
 
BB: Yeah.  
 
JL: Um-hm.  
 
BB: So it’s been a good life.  
 
JL: It’s been a very good life. Met a lot of great people at the park, still, some of them 
are still there. David, you know, and you have your stories about those who are good 
at certain things, some who aren’t. And Rich Caldwell, with his fear of snakes. 
Everybody’s got, got their little thing that they don’t like or—I remember Rich 
Caldwell once jumped on the hood of a vehic-, of a vehicle because David, a sn-, a 
snake got loose outside the— 
 
DL: I let him go. He didn’t get loose.  
 
JL: True.  
 
DL: I, I thought Rich was in the truck.  
 
JL: And he was out, and David threw the snake out of the bag or whatever it was.  
 
DL: It was a timber rattler, and it was a pretty, pretty good-sized snake. But I 
thought Rich was, had stayed in the truck.  
 
JL: And [ ] got out, and lo-and-behold, his little Missouri bod-, long, lanky Missouri 
body wound up on top of the vehicle as soon as he saw it. He does not like snakes. 
He’s funny. He’s retired now too. Everyone that was there at the park when I started 
working has either retired or has passed on with the exception of Vicky and Bobby 
Carson, Joe Duvall, Kevin Neff. I think that’s it.  
 
DL: Prob-, probably.  
 
JL: Everybody else is, is gone.  
 
DL: Bob Stewart is still in it. 
 
JL: No, Bob’s not working anymore.  
 
DL: Oh, he’s not? 
 
JL: Uh-uhn.  
 
DL: [ ] 
 
JL: [ ] And Bob, Joe Duvall and Kevin were both seasonals for quite a long time, and 
now they’re permanent staff. And then, of course, Joe, as you know, is considering 
retirement this, this year. That man’s got more than 50 years under his, well, not 50 
total years, but 50 years his career spans the National Park Service in either full-
time, part-time, or intermittent status. And he grad—he graduated—he retired from 
teaching, but he’s going to have a full retirement from the National Park Service as 
well, because of all the years that he had in, and he was able to buy back his seasonal 
time. So he’s going to be doing, he and his wife are going to be doing pretty well, I 
think in retirement, I hope. It’s like, and I hope he has long health for a lot of years. 
And knowing Joe, I think he will. I think he’ll see his 90s and maybe even beyond. I’m 
not kidding.  
 
BB: Um-hm.  
 
JL: The man is like the Energizer Bunny. He just keeps going. I hope I keep going too, 
just like the Energizer Bunny.  
 
BB: I hope you will too.  
 
JL: Yeah.  
 
BB: What would you give as advice to somebody who wanted to think about the 
park [1:05:00] service, and you know, talk to you? You’ve had a pretty good career. 
What, you know, what would you say to somebody about advancing themselves?  
 
JL: I would say don’t, don’t allow yourself to think you’re too good to do something. 
Allow yourself to try things and work harder than the money. You know, you, and, 
and do what you can. Don’t feel like you have to have a paying job to get your foot in 
the door. Volunteer, when you can. Keep that resume full of activities and paying 
jobs. You know, I think young people worry that there are jobs that are beneath 
them, and that they’re going to look bad on their resume. Well, that may be true, but 
if they’re working, they may think that, that they look bad, like working at Taco Bell, 
which I did, you know, working, list those, because they do help. And they’ll tell you, 
go back at least 10 years. Well, yeah, you need to go back. But also, within your, 
when you’re talking about what your work has been, put in all that volunteer time. 
Anything like that that you’ve done that has made a difference for someone or some 
organization, that will get you just as much credit as paying jobs do. And the rest of 
it, we look it, any supervisor with some sense will say, “Wasn’t too good for the job, 
took the job, need-, needed a paycheck, worked at Taco Bell.” Nothing against Taco 
Bell, but just happens to be where I worked for a while in the 19-, 1979. You know, 
and work. You got to have, don’t have any down time where it looks like you were 
just sitting on your laurels, or living off mom and dad. Keep something going all the 
time. Don’t let there be a break in that. And then show that you’ve tried to get your 
own training, like CPR training, First, First Aid training somewhere else. Don’t wait 
for someone to give it to you. Go out and seek it so that you can come to the table 
with those skills already in hand. And don’t give up. Keep trying until you feel like 
you can’t try anymore.  
 
BB: So you’ve always been a seeker yourself.  
 
JL: Yeah. I think so. Think so. You’re right. Hadn’t thought about it that way. Isn’t 
there a seeker on some movie or storybook or something, where there’s somebody 
that’s called the seeker? 
 
DL: Is that a Harry Potter thing? I don’t know. [ ] could tell you.  
 
JL: I don’t know. (laughs) I don’t know. But yeah, I mean, I just, I, I, and I’ve taught 
my daughters, we’ve, David and I’ve both have taught our daughters to reach for 
whatever your dream is and, and don’t, and money’s not the begin all and end all. 
You find what you enjoy doing. It doesn’t matter what the money is as long as you 
can make your way, pay your bills, live within your means, but do what you love, 
because it is true, if you’re doing what you love, you don’t really work a day in your 
life. It’s true.  
 
DL: The only catch there is what you love very often has some very hard work 
involved.  
 
JL: That’s true. (laughs) It does have a lot of hard work, but the thing is you enjoy 
doing it. And when you enjoy it, you can go to sleep with a good, with nothing but 
the best feelings in your heart and your own self—and about yourself. You know, 
pride in what you do and being an honorable person, Mr. Mayor.  
 
DL: Hm.  
 
JL: Yeah.  
 
BB: Do you have any final thoughts? 
 
JL: I hope not. (laughs) 
 
BB: That was good. Thank you. Thank you both.  
 
JL: Thank you.
