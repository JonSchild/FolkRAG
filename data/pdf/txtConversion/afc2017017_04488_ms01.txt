[00:00:21] (KS) I’m going to ask you some basic questions first and then we’ll get into a more of 
a conversational. Okay. This is Kim Stryker. I’m here on January 10, 2018. The time is 1:13 pm 
and we are at Linden Vineyards. I am sitting here with Jim Law. Jim can you give me your full 
name? 
 
[00:00:48] (JL) Full name is James McConway Law. It’s very Scottish. 
[00:01:16] (KS) What do you describe this room as? Is it a tasting room? 
[00:01:18] (JL) We call it The Library.

[00:01:22] (KS) And you were telling me that this is a place that you come with staff to do 
sample testing of how things are coming along with the wines? 
 
[00:01:33] (JL) Yes, It's used primarily for tasting for very research, professional tasting. You 
want to make sure that you have under the same circumstances, you try to taste wine as 
objectively as possible. It’s not possible to be totally objective, but if you limit the environmental 
influences by having it in the same place where it’s quite and you have the same form, the same 
set up all the time it makes a difference. 
 
[00:02:14] (KS) What would you say that your job title is here? 
[00:02:20] (JL) I call myself the wine grower. 
[00:02:30] (KS) Any other titles that you might go by? Boss? 
[00:02:34] (JL) Nope. Owner, I guess. Proprietor. 
[00:02:38] (KS) Previously, what kind of work were you in? 
[00:02:42] (JL) I was a kid. 
[00:02:43] (KS) Oh, you’ve always done this? 
 
[00:02:46] (JL) Yeah. I was from college to this I was a Peace Corps volunteer for two years, 
doing agriculture. 
 
[00:02:55] (KS) Where did you serve? 
[00:02:57] (JL) Zaire, which is now Congo. 
[00:03:03] (KS) And that was an agricultural project that you were working on? 
[00:03:06] (JL) Yes, it was teaching in a vocational school, ag school. 
[00:03:13] (KS) What part of Zaire were you in? 
[00:03:15] (JL) Well, it’s kind of hard to describe unless you know anything about Zaire. It’s 
right on the equator. It was five day upstream, two, three day downstream boat ride. 
 
[00:03:27] (KS) Is there a town there now, or is it? 
 
[00:03:31] (JL) Oh yeah, there’s a town. It’s called Inongo in the province of Mandobe in the 
bigger province of Dandunde. Mandobe, Dandunde Zaire. 
 
[00:03:40] (KS) Have you ever been back?

afc2017/017

[00:03:44] (JL) No 
 
[00:03:46] (KS) Would you like to go back? 
 
[00:03:48] (JL) I would, but I realize the difficulty of it. At my age now, I’m not in my twenties 
anymore. It’s physically hard and mentally hard. While I could do that then with ease, it’s a lot 
more difficult now. 
 
[00:04:14] (KS) I know. I spent a little time in Uganda as a volunteer. Not in the Peace Corps, 
but with a conservation group and 
 
[00:04:23] (JL) My daughter just got back from Uganda. She was also a Peace Corps volunteer 
in Namibia. Now she’s sort of made it her career. She works with USAID on contracts, doing 
mostly women’s health issues and supply chain things, HIV. 
 
[00:04:48] (KS) So there’s no chance that she’s going to be going into the wine business? 
 
[00:04:52] (JL) There’s always that possibility, but right now she’s really enjoying what she’s 
doing. 
 
[00:05:00] (KS) So, father. That’s another role that you play. You have, how many children? 
[00:05:07] (JL) Just one. 
[00:05:13] (KS) So you said, this was it after college you went to Peace Corps, you did the 
teaching at an ag program and you came back here. How did you get started in wine? 
 
[00:05:26] (JL) Well I grew up with wine on the table and I love wine, but never saw it as a 
career thing and then I fell in love with farming and saw that as a career. I love being abroad and 
the excitement there, but I knew that if I really wanted to farm I needed to come back to the 
states. It was almost impossible to do it elsewhere for me, because I wasn’t a citizen of wherever 
else that would be. So I came back and decided to just jump right in and get a job working for a 
small family operation of wine growers and found I loved the work. 
 
[00:06:09] (KS) Where was this? 
 
[00:06:10] (JL) This was in Ohio. That’s where I’m from. 
[00:06:13] (KS) So where, you were born where? 
[00:06:16] (JL) I was born in Tokyo, Japan. My father was military, but he was an engineer, so I 
grew up in many different places, but we always came back to Ohio, because he was stationed in 
Cincinnati. 
 
[00:06:33] (KS) So there were, when do you think this was about when you came back from 
college, timeframe, that you began to work for that first group of wine growers?

[00:06:42] (JL) 1979. 
 
[00:06:44] (KS) So they were growing wine grapes in Ohio back then? 
 
[00:06:50] (JL) Oh yeah, up on Lake Erie it’s a big. It’s been 150 years of, but mostly Welches. 
Welches is a cooperative. They have growers up and down Lake Erie where they are growing 
mostly Concord. 
 
[00:07:07] (KS) Oh okay, so they were growing for different industries. Not necessarily for 
wine. 
 
[00:07:11] (JL) Right and in the 70s they started to make that transition to making wine. 
 
[00:07:20] (KS) So there was already an established group of farmers that was growing for 
Welches and maybe some other brands, but in the 70s they were starting to do wine production 
as well. Or grapes to sell to wine? 
 
[00:07:37] (JL) A little bit of both. But this family was one of the first to start converting some, 
they still grew for Welches, but they started growing some other wine grape varieties and making 
their own wine and they were very small at that time and they’ve grown a lot since then. 
 
[00:07:55] (KS) What was their name? 
 
[00:07:58] (JL) It was called Chalet Debonné. Their last name was Debevek, which was 
Croatian, or Slovenian, but Chalet Debevek didn’t appeal. So the Frenchified it. Former 
Yugoslavian, but I can’t remember. 
 
[00:08:58] (KS) Okay, so they had been in business for a while and during this and they were 
transitioning to making their own wine. How did you connect with them? 
 
[00:09:08] (JL) The old fashioned way of just getting in my truck and knocking on doors. Where 
did I meet Tony? I think at a growers meeting or something like that and I just shot gunned 
myself out there. Obviously this was before the internet and all of that. 
 
[00:09:28] (KS) Tony was the patriarch of the family? 
 
[00:09:32] (JL) No, he was the son who was interested in making that transition. It had been in 
the family for many generations, but just growing grapes and selling to Welches. He was the one 
who wanted to do more than that. So he started the winery. His goal was to make enough money 
to buy and airplane and put in a landing strip and a hangar, which he now has all of that. 
 
[00:10:01] (KS) I guess he was making the right choice. 
[00:10:06] (JL) Very successful.

[00:10:09] (KS) He was making some of his own wine, but was he also selling to other producers 
to make wine? 
 
[00:10:17] (JL) No, he pretty much, once he got going they needed all the grapes they could get 
and made the wine. 
 
[00:10:33] (KS) You came to work there and you chose grape production, you said you drank 
wine at the table, but what in particular? You could have gone into dairy, you could have gone 
into orcharding 
 
[00:10:45] (JL) When I was in Zaire I particularly was attracted to growing coffee and cocoa 
which are perennial crops, while not exactly fruit sort of along those lines, where you plant the 
young tree, you bring it up to fruition, you prune it every year. There’s just something that was 
very attractive to me about that. 
 
[00:11:08] (KS) And getting it established and it continues to produce. I can see the similarities 
between them. You came back to Ohio. Were you already familiar that there was such an 
industry? 
 
[00:11:23] (JL) I knew that there was an industry going on, but I remember as soon as I got back, 
my dad and I hopped in the car and started driving to any winery within driving distance to see 
what was going on. 
 
[00:11:37] (KS) So there was already an established network out there? 
 
[00:11:39] (JL) There was. It was much smaller and much more primitive, but it was out there. 
[00:11:47] (KS) Not all of these beautiful tasting rooms and everything, parking 
[00:11:52] (JL) No 
 
[00:11:54] (KS) You got into there, what was your initial role in the farm? 
 
[00:12:00] (JL) It’s what we lovingly call cellar rat. Cellar rat is somebody who does whatever 
they’re told to do. It usually involves cleaning. 
 
[00:12:14] (KS) So you’d be cleaning on the production floor or? 
 
[00:12:18] (JL) Cleaning barrels especially, but also pumping wine from one barrel to another, 
but bottling wines, but also doing a lot outside, pruning vines, tying vines, crop thinning. 
 
[00:12:33] (KS) There’s always something to do, isn’t there? Cellar rat. Is that a common phrase 
in the industry? And so that’s sort of the grunt level, coming in? 
 
[00:12:47] (JL) Yes. That’s the first level.

[00:12:51] (KS) How long did you, were you in the role of cellar rat? 
 
[00:12:55] (JL) Only about a year or a little more. Then I basically understood that Ohio wasn’t 
where I wanted to be and the reason was professional reasons. I grew up drinking European 
wines and that’s what I wanted to make. I realized that at that time Ohio was more making 
sweeter wines. I knew that I would struggle my entire life to try to sell the wines that I wanted to 
make. So I knew that I needed to go to one of the coasts, east coast or west coast. And long story 
short I had two job offers and I chose the one in Virginia. 
 
[00:13:47] (KS) But it must have been a bit of a stretch to imagine, I’m projecting too much. 
What were your thoughts of wine production in Virginia going out there? 
 
[00:13:58] (JL) I was influenced by the fact that there was two wineries, one called 
Barboursville, which I’m sure you know, and the other called Rappadam, which you may not 
know. Barboursville was Italian and Rappadam was German and simply the fact that an Italian 
and a German had established themselves in Virginia was almost enough for me right there. But 
then I did some research into the climate and the soils and it looked like there was a lot of 
promise in Virginia. 
 
[00:14:37] (KS) Do you know approximately how many wineries were there? 
[00:14:42] (JL) It was about eight. 
[00:14:45] (KS) And so what year was this? 
 
[00:14:47] (JL) 1981. March of 1981 was when I arrived. 
 
[00:14:59] (KS) So that’s changed. In a really relatively short period of time. That’s not a long 
time to have developed. 
 
[00:15:08] (JL) As soon as I got here in 81 you could see the changes already in the wineries it 
seemed every year almost doubling. 
 
[00:15:19] (KS) you came to work for which one? 
 
[00:15:23] (JL) Trimountain Winery. Remind me, I’ve got an old poster put out by wine 
marketing that has all the wineries. This was probably, Linden’s on it, so probably the late 80s. 
Most of those wineries don’t exist anymore. 
 
[00:15:45] (KS) Is Trimountain still in existence? 
[00:15:47] (JL) No 
[00:15:49] (KS) And who owned Trimountain? 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

[00:15:53] (JL) Joe Geraci. Second generation Italian. Ornery ---. Nobody liked him. He made a 
lot of money doing lots of different things. He had established a vineyard. He was selling his 
grapes to home wine makers mostly, a little bit to Shenandoah vineyards. He decided he wasn’t 
getting enough money or whatever, so he decided to establish a winery where he had his 
vineyard. He was looking for somebody to be his winemaker and I got the job. I still to this day 
think that he thought he was hiring somebody else. He was 72 years old. But I got the job and 
he put me up in the apartment that he used to live in, in back of Dinosaur Land. 
 
[00:17:05] (KS) Dinosaur Land is in? 
 
[00:17:07] (JL) It’s in the town of White Post around south. 
[00:17:14] (KS) It really was connected to Dinosaur Land? 
[00:17:16] (JL) He owned Dinosaur Land. It’s one of the ways he made money, the gift shop. It’s 
still there. 
 
[00:17:26] (KS) That must have been a very strange place to move to. 
 
[00:17:28] (JL) Very strange, but it’s the first real place I ever lived. Before I was living in 
dilapidated everything. For me it was luxury. 
 
[00:17:41] (KS) And how old were you about this time? 
[00:17:45] (JL) I would have been 26. 
[00:17:50] (KS) And no specific training in wine making? 
 
[00:17:56] (JL) Nope, just on the job and self-educated. Reading everything I could get, going to 
seminars, taking night classes in anything that was relevant. 
 
[00:18:08] (KS) Was there much to choose from? Did they have things like in the ag extension 
program? 
 
[00:18:14] (JL) They did. I could go to seminars specifically on grape diseases or that sort of 
things. I have a liberal arts education, so I went back and took courses in chemistry, soil science, 
welding, you name it. 
 
[00:18:34] (KS) I think that’s one of the things that people don’t understand about, when you 
own a vineyard you have to suddenly become good at a whole lot of things, at least passable at a 
whole lot of things. With any farm really. If you’re not good at math it’s not going to work. 
 
[00:18:53] (JL) While there’s truth to that, that’s one of the changes I’ve seen in my lifetime. It 
used to be a jack of all trades. When you came here we were looking at a frozen pipe that burst. 
I’ll have to go to the hardware store, get the fittings, and fix it. I can do that. I can weld 
something. I can work on equipment, tractors. You don’t see that as much anymore. You see

people coming in that, if something goes wrong you call, call somebody. Call the plumber. Call 
the mechanic. 
 
[00:19:26] (KS) Right, I’ve definitely heard that too with people who were doing, I don’t mean 
to sound condescending, but hobby farms, where they, maybe they had a really successful job in 
the city and then they were retiring and they were like, well I’m going to retire and farm, not 
realizing all the labors involved with that. 
 
[00:19:47] (JL) And then there’s some people who do that and actually are skilled and able and 
love it too. 
 
[00:19:55] (KS) It goes both ways. You’re 26 years old and you’re just grabbing books and 
taking seminars. It’s pre-internet times so you can’t do online classes. You’re just grabbing stuff 
where you can. 
 
[00:20:11] (JL) One is very naïve at 26 and it’s my naiveté that made me get to where I am now, 
because if I wasn’t naïve I wouldn’t have considered doing this. 
 
[00:20:33] (KS) I think that’s why people have children young too, because when you get older 
you’re like, this sounds like a lot of work. You’re 26. You’re making wine for Joe. And Joe’s a 
curmudgeon, but he started to make his own, he opened an actual winery for people to visit. Was 
he interested in distribution of wine? Or was he just about coming to the place? 
 
[00:21:00] (JL) No he was interested in, he didn’t have any idea, I didn’t have any idea, nobody 
really had any idea what that really involved. We were, again, naïve. He asked me, I know I went 
around a little bit and knocked on some doors. We got thrown out. He had a deal, because he 
knew somebody who owned a small chain of grocery stores, so we got some in there. 
 
[00:21:24] (KS) But it was really kind of a shot in the dark? 
 
[00:21:27] (JL) Yeah, it was more, I wasn’t too involved in the sales end, so I don’t know how 
he did in that regard. 
 
[00:21:34] (KS) The goal was to produce wine for a retail market to the customers? And he was 
trying to make European style blends? 
 
[00:21:44] (JL) Yes, although anything would go if you could sell it. So we did make some 
sweeter wines, some plum wine once, but most of it was dry table wine. 
 
[00:22:02] (KS) Was that unusual for the time, to do a more dry table wine. 
 
[00:22:07] (JL) Not necessarily. It depends on the operation and it depends on the market. 
There’s what we still call in the industry, there’s country wines and city wines. Country wines 
are more sweeter and fruit driven, usually less expensive and they tend to be those wineries that 
don’t have access to an urban market. Once you go out to the Shenandoah Valley you start 
seeing a little bit more. If you go up to Pennsylvania and North Carolina you see a lot. That’s

what one of the things that I realized in my youth, that I need to be near a good market and 
Washington DC was a great market to sell the wine I wanted to make. It has proven to be a very 
wise move. 
 
[00:23:00] (KS) Did you factor that into your calculations when you decided to come here? That 
you’re an hour outside of DC? In the 80s it was still a little bit sleepy, but there were always a lot 
of international people, people who had traveled a lot. Was that a factor at all? 
 
[00:23:23] (JL) Yes, that was definitely a factor. The main thing was what I call the viticultural 
potential here with the climate and the soils and the terrain, but second was the market. Because 
marketing is not my forte. It’s not what I want to do, but you have to do it if you’re in business. 
So the easier I could make that end of the business, the more time I could spend in the vineyard. 
 
[00:23:55] (KS) In your initial wine making, when was your first vintage? 
 
[00:24:00] (JL) My first vintage in Virginia was 1981 at Trimountain. I was at Trimountain for a 
couple years. Finally I had had enough of Joe Geraci and by that time I was already starting 
work, we’ll call it consulting, for other operations that were starting up. Also, I was teaching 
classes at the community colleges. 
 
[00:24:26] (KS) Teaching classes in what? 
 
[00:24:28] (JL) Grape growing, wine making. Lord Fairfax community college in 1981. It was 
again one of those chance things. I was looking at the local newspaper and they had an ad. This 
was two miles away from where I worked, saying that they were starting this program and 
looking for instructors in grape growing, wine making, and wine appreciation and I was the only 
one that applied who was qualified, so I was teaching the entire curriculum. 
 
[00:24:57] (KS) That plays into later when I get into, you do have a reputation for being the 
godfather of so many of these other vineyards, because so many people came to you for help,  
advice, mentoring over the years. After a couple years you left and you started Linden right off? 
 
[00:25:19] (JL) Yes and no. I bought the land in 1983, but I spent a year clearing it and prepping 
it and grafting vine and propagating. In 1985 I planted the first vines. And of course still for 
several years there’s no income. So that’s when I was doing a lot of consulting and teaching. 
 
[00:25:47] (KS) I think that’s the big barrier for a lot of people, isn’t it. You get into it, but how 
do you support yourself in those several years where you’re still doing stuff, but you’re not 
making money. 
 
[00:25:59] (JL) It is and it’s gotten a lot harder, because land prices are much higher. 
[00:26:05] (KS) How many acres did you buy in that initial? 
[00:26:08] (JL) 76. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

[00:26:10] (KS) Is that the same as what you have now? Do you remember what acres were 
going for then? 
 
[00:26:17] (JL) About $1,200 an acre. I was the first one in this area to spend more than $1,000 
an acre and everyone thought I was nuts. 
 
[00:26:27] (KS) He’s some kind of rock star throwing your money around. There’s still people 
who just can’t believe it, because they’ve lived here they’re whole lives. You paid this for? So 
you bought the land 1985, the first vines were planted. When did you start to be able to have a 
harvest? 
 
[00:26:47] (JL) 1987. 
 
[00:26:55] (KS) And did you bottle everything? 
 
[00:26:58] (JL) We made the equivalent of about 1,000 cases from the acreage, plus I did buy 
some fruit, some Riesling, from a grower in the valley and bottled it and opened in April of 1988 
with two wines. 
 
[00:27:22] (KS) So, you have a Riesling and? 
 
[00:27:25] (JL) It was a Riesling, Vidal Blanc and Cyvao. 
 
[00:27:39] (KS) Not much to offer, but at that point, was it enough of a novelty that people 
would still come? 
 
[00:27:46] (JL) Yes they would come. Not like they’re coming now. I remember mowing the 
grass with a push mower on a Saturday waiting for somebody to come and a car comes and you 
get down to the tasting room and say, okay, I’m ready. 
 
[00:28:03] (KS) Initially, were you married at this point? What was happening in your life? 
[00:28:09] (JL) Yes 
[00:28:10] (KS) When did you get married? 
 
[00:28:12] (JL) 82 and my, now ex-wife Peggy, was very helpful in getting started. She did a lot 
of the work too. 
 
[00:28:22] (KS) What was her maiden name? 
[00:28:24] (JL) Cohen. 
[00:28:38] (KS) She and you, did you have any children yet? 
[00:28:43] (JL) Not until 88.

[00:28:45] (KS) So you guys just threw everything in at the same time. Have your first child, 
make your first wine, go into the 
 
[00:28:53] (JL) Again, naiveté, like in Africa you just strap them to your back and keep going. 
[00:28:57] (KS) So is that what you were doing out in the vineyards? 
[00:28:59] (JL) That’s what was supposed to happen, but that’s not what happened. For some 
reason we couldn’t make that happen. 
 
[00:29:11] (KS) Your daughter was born, is it okay to include her name? 
[00:29:16] (JL) Sure, Samantha. 
[00:29:19] (KS) In 88 as well. Like you said, business was slow initially. 
 
[00:29:32] (JL) It was slow, but we could sell what we needed to sell. And we also, at that time, I 
hate to admit it, but we did a lot of festivals, because we had to, and that was very important 
early on for cash flow, sales. And also bringing people here. We also distributed to wine shops. 
We’d load up the van. We had a little mini van. We’d load that up once every two weeks 
 
[00:29:58] (KS) Mostly in Northern Virginia like in town more? 
[00:30:00] (JL) Mostly Northern Virginia, like Fairfax, Alexandria. 
[00:30:04] (KS) Do you recall any of the shops that you dealt with in those days? 
 
[00:30:08] (JL) Fern Street Gourmet was a huge fan of ours. They were in Alexandria. Sutton 
Place Gourmet. There was Arrow Wine. 
 
[00:30:26] (KS) Arrow Wine is still going strong. 
 
[00:30:29] (JL) Leesburg Vintner up in Leesburg. For a while we, when Total Wines started we 
did that. 
 
[00:30:40] (KS) And did you have any issue getting on the shelves? What was involved with 
doing that? 
 
[00:30:47] (JL) No not really. People were curious about Virginia wine. We’ve always enjoyed a 
good reputation, so usually if someone was going to try Virginia wine they’d get in touch with us 
and then eventually I took on a distributor, because it was getting to be more than what we could 
handle. 
 
[00:31:12] (KS) And do you still sell like that? Like wholesale to retail establishments? 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
11
[00:31:16] (JL) Yes. Mostly restaurants now. 
 
[00:31:37] (KS) How do you establish those relationships with restaurants? Do they come to you 
or do you pitch to them? 
 
[00:31:46] (JL) I don’t actively sell anything. We took on a distributor. We’ve gone through 
several distributors, but I saw it coming with the boom in locavore and with restaurants and 
specifically in DC. DC it was almost impossible to get into for many decades. There was a lot of 
resistance. 
 
[00:32:10] (KS) And they have weird laws about crossing state lines. 
 
[00:32:13] (JL) Yeah, but it wasn’t so much that. It was the mentality. Virginians were patriotic 
to Virginia wines, but once you crossed the Potomac, uh uh. I kind of knew that that was going 
to change. You could see it with the food and you knew that the wine wasn’t far behind. So I 
hired a distributor and their focus was DC restaurants. The timing was just right. With our 
reputation and the distributor’s reputation it’s worked out really well. 
 
[00:32:50] (KS) Going back to this period of time when you’re just getting started and you’re 
going to festivals and you’re going to wine shops, that was all in the late 80s early 90s? 
 
[00:33:03] (JL) Yeah. 
 
[00:33:09] (KS) When did that change, when you went to a distribution company and things 
started to get big? 
 
[00:33:15] (JL) Probably about mid 80s or mid 90s. 
[00:33:26] (KS) You saw more of an appetite for it. 
[00:33:28] (JL) Yeah, and it was also, I learned that while on the surface you make more money 
if you do things yourself, but then it starts stretching you thin and so, stick with what you do 
best. So I decided that distribution would go somewhere else. What I didn’t realize, what nobody 
realizes when they start this, is that they are distributors. They distribute your wine. They don’t 
sell your wine. It’s up to you to sell your wine. So you thought, okay they’re going to take care 
of it, but you still have to do your work. Eventually I found that with our reputation we didn’t 
need to be involved anymore, which was great. And if you have a good relationship with the 
right kind of people, who are your distributors, it’s great. 
 
[00:34:22] (KS) I think that’s another thing that maybe people don't take into account when they 
think about the myths of being a winemaker or wine grower. That you still have to have this 
business acumen and this talent of dealing with people. I know I’ve definitely met some people 
who are less gregarious or less than dealing with social interactions. 
 
[00:34:50] (JL) Yes and I find that I truly enjoy and am good at relating with people that are 
truly interested. Obviously professionals, but also consumers at a high level, educated 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
12
consumers. What I’m not good at is dealing with casual people. They’re just interested in having 
a good time. They don’t really care. The classic one was at a festival. The last festival I ever did. 
When you go to pour the wine you say, are you interested in a certain wine? Whatever’s coldest. 
I don’t care. Okay, I’m wasting my life with this. 
 
[00:35:27] (KS) It’s just an alcohol carrying system for them. When was the last festival that you 
think you did? 
 
[00:35:35] (JL) It was in the early to mid 90s. Somewhere in there. I remember it specifically, 
because not only were there a lot of drunk people, but there was also a huge hailstorm that took 
down the tent. It was just a flaming disaster. That’s when I, this is not what, no. 
 
[00:35:56] (KS) When did you start to feel, hey I’m pretty good at this? 
[00:36:08] (JL) I don’t know. 
[00:36:09] (KS) Have you yet? 
 
[00:36:10] (JL) Yeah, there’s a different, one of our mottos is, never content. You always, 
humility is one of the best attributes you can have to make great wine. Once you really think 
you’re the cat’s meow at making great wine, you’re probably not. 
 
[00:36:30] (KS) Or something catastrophic happens seasonally. What would you say was your 
hardest year in wine making? Or hardest experience? 
 
[00:36:41] (JL) Hardest vintage? Probably 2003 was the most difficult vintage we’ve ever faced. 
[00:36:48] (KS) What was the circumstances? 
[00:36:51] (JL) It just, it was cold and rainy and cloudy throughout the whole growing season. 
We had great crop reduction and the quality was not very good. 
 
[00:37:08] (KS) What do you when that happens? 
 
[00:37:13] (JL) That’s why one has inventory. That’s the nice thing about growing grapes and 
making wine. We have several years inventory. You’re going to have bad years. You know that’s 
going to happen, so 
 
[00:37:34] (KS) How much do you decide to set back? Does it depend on the yield that harvest? 
Or do you have a standard that you like to try to set aside? 
 
[00:37:41] (JL) There’s, wines evolve once they’re bottled and we taste them and we wouldn’t 
want to release something that’s going through what’s called bottle shock. I don’t know if you’ve 
heard that term. When any wine is bottled it shuts down. It goes into a shell. It’s not going to 
taste bad, it just doesn’t have much going on. That’s what we called closed down or disjointed. 
And then it slowly reemerges. It always does, but sometimes it can take a month or two. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
13
Sometimes it can take six months, sometimes a year. And then even after that it’s sort of back to 
where it was. And then it evolves even more in the bottle, gets more complexity and more 
harmony and that’s when it really starts getting good. So the question is how long can you wait. 
Because we can’t have four vintages of wine here. But we can do two, maybe three. So you taste 
and release according to when things are evolving. 
 
[00:38:52] (KS) And have you ever been in a situation where you’ve been, maybe you’ve had 
limited supply and you’ve been tempted to bring some of that stuff out, just because you need to 
fill the shelves, so to speak? 
 
[00:39:03] (JL) Yeah, there’s always something that we’ll have. It might not be the best 
selection, because they’re not ready. We’re facing that right now. Our top end reds are the 14s, 
which we should be releasing, are still pretty closed down. It was a vintage that requires more 
time, so we’re kind of out of those wines. Those are our prestige wines. So it makes it tough. The 
most valuable asset we have is reputation. So if you start fooling with your reputation you will 
hurt yourself in the long run. 
 
[00:39:45] (KS) In some ways, if you can look at it abstractly, I guess it would be nice to sell that 
case right now, but if you let it get better you’re going to create more sales down the line. 
Because people will taste that and say, oh that was great. I’d like to get some more. 
 
[00:40:03] (JL) And that’s one of the differences we found between thirty years ago and now. 
The average palate is much more experienced, sophisticated, and savvy than it was then. So you 
will be rewarded for your patience and good work, whereas before it wasn’t so much the case. 
 
[00:40:24] (KS) How many people does it take to run. You started out it was you and your wife 
and how many people, did you have staff? 
 
[00:40:33] (JL) No, we had occasional part time, but then after about three years or so we started 
hiring full time, just one person, maybe two people and built up from there. Now, including 
myself, there’s six of us full time. 
 
[00:41:01] (KS) An that’s year round work? 
[00:41:03] (JL) Yes 
[00:41:04] (KS) So does that mean everybody who works here does multiple things? 
 
[00:41:10] (JL) Yes, although there’s certain, Sherry, who greeted you, she’s our manager. She 
does all the human resources, accounting, scheduling, she also does lab work. During harvest she 
does the pressing and pumping over. Then she has her own five acre vineyard that she takes care 
of in the morning and she comes here in the afternoon. 
 
[00:41:51] (KS) That’s interesting. She’s like, I can’t get enough. Being in a vineyard. You have 
six, what are the different? You have you, Sherry 
Winery Workers in Virginia

[00:42:03] (JL) And then Jonathan Webber, who is the winemaker. He started as an apprentice 
seven years ago. He came to us with some experience as a cellar rat. We got along so well and I 
really liked his palate and his work, so he became cellar master, which is the next step and then I 
promoted him to wine maker two years ago. I’ve held that title since the beginning and now it’s 
time for me to start giving up things. 
 
[00:42:37] (KS) And letting someone else develop their career with it. I’m sure you still have a 
lot of input. And so you have, who else is here? 
 
[00:42:47] (JL) We have Heraro, Ricardo, Eloy, and Jesus. And obviously from their names 
they’re, Heraro Chavez, Eloy Chavez, Jesus, Chavez. And they’re all cousins. They’re all from 
the same village in Mexico, but now two of them are American citizens. They’ve been working 
for me almost thirty years. 
 
[00:42:20] (KS) And they’re from Mexico originally? 
[00:42:22] (JL) Yeah. 
[00:43:27] (KS) It’s interesting. Out here you get a lot of people from Mexico working, or who 
are originally from Mexico, but in town you almost never meet… 
 
[00:43:38] (JL) Yeah it’s more Salvadorian. 
 
[00:43:40] (KS) Yeah, Salvadorians, people from Peru or Bolivia. 
 
[00:43:45] (JL) Well it kind of makes sense. Somebody comes in as the pioneer and they get a 
job and then they bring 
 
[00:43:53] (KS) I think it's also because of the agricultural work. 
 
[00:43:57] (JL) It’s agricultural work. Some of them, when they first came to the US they were 
working in some factories and they hated it. They hated it. 
 
[00:44:05] (KS) I know also, because of the horse farms, a lot of people have hired Mexican 
workers to take care of the horses. I don’t know which came first. 
 
[00:44:17] (JL) These guys came first to the orchards. The orchards in this area were much 
bigger than they are now and much more of a source. They all came to one orchard that ended up 
going under. It was in Flint Hill. I can’t remember the name. It might have been Flint Hill 
Orchard. I don’t know. At the time I was managing a vineyard in Flint Hill and got to know 
them. They were helping out with the harvests and all and I was just so impressed with their 
work. It just worked out. I knew their situation was that they needed full time work. It’s really 
hard in agriculture. So I made it happen. 
 
[00:45:09] (KS) It paid off. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
15
[00:45:10] (JL) Yeah. 
 
[00:45:11] (KS) The biggest thing that I hear from people, especially who are newer to the 
industry of Virginia wine making is that you can’t get any help. And it’s like, well, you’re 
pioneering. You have to bring people up with you. 
 
[00:45:21] (JL) It’s not that you can’t find good help. I say it’s that you can’t find good bosses. 
It’s because people don’t want to put somebody full time on the payroll. They want to have 
people when they need them, but then they want them to go away. 
 
[00:45:43] (KS) And not have to pay them. 
 
[00:45:46] (JL) You’re not going to get skilled experienced workers that way. As I say, the way 
we can make great wine is by hand labeling, mending fences, butting firewood. There’s always 
something to do. Am I losing my shirt having somebody hand label and do firewood? Yes, but it 
worth it, because when it’s crunch time there’s somebody who knows exactly what to do and 
they’re skilled. They’re fast. It works. 
 
[00:46:18] (KS) It’s sort of a big picture thing. What are you seeing that’s different? We talked 
about a little, before we started recording, that the changes in Virginia winemaking. Yes, you had 
the people making what you called the country wine. Especially people who were a bit further 
out, but then you’ve had this explosion to where there’s about 280 wineries in the state of 
Virginia. There is obviously a big demand for that, but there’s also a lot more competition, so 
people have carved out niches for themselves. What are your reflections on what’s going on right 
now? 
 
[00:47:09] (JL) I’ll be the curmudgeon. I’m very disheartened as far as what’s happened with the 
entertainment, the virtual wineries. You say there’s 280 wineries. Well if you define a Virginia 
farm winery as something that grows most of their own grapes and makes their wine there’s 
about 60, maybe 100 at the most. The rest are smoke and mirrors. There’s people who don’t even 
grow grapes or make wine, but they’re wineries? How does that work? We call them rural tasting 
rooms. But I’ve gotten over that, even though it doesn’t sound like I’ve have. There’s certain 
producers that we get along really well. We learn a lot from each other and we’re all obviously 
growing our grapes and making our wine. That’s our community. It’s not organized in any way. 
We just get together and talk about things. We travel together. We taste together. 
 
[00:48:20] (KS) So who would be some of those people? 
 
[00:48:27] (JL) The three that get together most are Barboursville, RDV, and Linden. The three 
of us, even though we’re very different operations we have a lot of respect for one another. 
 
[00:48:42] (KS) You have a mutual respect and adoration society. Do you feel like you share a 
common worldview about your approach to wine and winemaking? 
 
[00:49:00] (JL) Yes. Even though, I mean Barboursville is huge. Luke is just amazing. You’ve 
probably talked to him. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
16
 
[00:49:06] (KS) I haven’t yet. What’s his full name? 
 
[00:49:08] (JL) Luca Paschina. If possible, you should also talk to Fernando. That’s 
Barboursville’s vineyard manager. Fernando is one of those great stories. He was a refugee from 
either El Salvador or Guatemala. Back in the 80s he was working in a vineyard and could hardly 
speak English. Now he’s one of the most respected vineyard managers in the United States. 
 
[00:50:23] (KS) I would love to talk to him. That would be amazing. Because, part of it is, yes 
while the vineyards are primarily owned by men for the most part, with some exceptions, and the 
tend to be white men, but what I think is really interesting about their work force is that there 
tends to be a lot of diversity in who they employ. There’s a lot women working in Virginia 
wineries. That’s been impressive. Wine makers as well, at all levels. I think that’s been a really 
interesting. One of the things that women have told me, that work in it. And people from Europe 
who come here, because they can do things here that they can’t do in Europe. I think that’s one 
of the really interesting things. That there is a freedom to making wine. 
 
[00:51:20] (JL) There’s a freedom and there’s a prestige. In Europe it’s quite amazing that, 
unless you’re an owner, if you’re a wine maker or vineyard manager it’s real blue collar work. 
There’s very little respect. I shouldn’t respect. There’s very little prestige. If you’re a wine 
maker, it’s like, yeah, so? You could be working at a dairy or anywhere else. It’s the same. And 
the pay is actually pretty low compared to here. Same with a chef in Europe. In most places it’s 
just considered a job, but here you have your own tv shows. 
 
[00:52:04] (KS) You’re a magician somehow. You made this magic thing happen. That’s 
interesting. I can see how, if you really do want to make a name for yourself fin an industry, the 
restrictions and the conformity that happens in a lot of the traditional wine growing regions could 
be very limiting. So you could get some really avant-garde or people who are a little more 
outside the box coming here. 
 
[00:52:36] (JL) Exactly. That’s what immigration is all about. That’s what’s made this country 
what it is. Those are the people with the extra kind of push. We tend to attract 
 
[00:52:54] (KS) With that entrepreneurial spirit. Which all of you have that in common. All of 
the Virginia wine makers, to some degree, have that push and that entrepreneurial, because it’s a 
risky business. There’s no guarantee that, this is not something that you do to get rich quick. 
Many, many of my interviews have said, what’s the quote? Want to make a small fortune? Put a 
big fortune into one. 
 
[00:53:23] (JL) I hate that quote, because it discourages people from getting in. This whole 
money thing is unfortunate. I think it’s hurting the industry. Not just in Virginia, but all over the 
United States. In order to get the price of entry is so high. It is high. It is possible. Another 
person that I highly recommend talking to is the couple who have Otero Winery. 
 
[00:53:53] (KS) I have talked to them. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
17
[00:53:55] (JL) They’re ones that, finally, somebody in the modern age has done it themselves. 
[00:54:05] (KS) But it’s tough on them. I think they’re really struggling to make a go of it. 
[00:54:10] (JL) Sure. That’s part of it. As I told Sandy. I said at one point I could see, I said 
that’s the thing, you can’t get out. You have to stay. There’s no other option. That’s why you’ll 
be successful. 
 
[00:54:34] (KS) Because you have to make it work, one way or another. And I know that they’re 
going for, they’re one of those wineries that is really going for quantity over quality and they 
have a very clear vision about what they’re trying to create there, which I think is the biggest 
advantage that they have on their side, that really particular. But it’s tough, they’ve got kids. 
They’re right next to my friend’s farm, Hollin Farms. Tom Davenport. Tom was my entry into 
this community, because he’s done so much work in folklore and he’s a folklorist. 
 
[00:55:11] (JL) I just ran into him when I was voting the last cycle. He gave me his, he did a 
documentary on a lynching that happened right here. 
 
[00:55:25] (KS) It’s a powerful film. It’s really well done and I know he’s a firebrand and a 
character and everything, but he’s been great, because he’s introduced me to this wild and wacky 
world. Where do you see this going for you, with Linden? 
 
[00:55:57] (JL) We’re just trying to have as much fun as we can, which might sound, we love 
what we do, but sometimes we take it too seriously and get all stressed out. We’re trying to let 
that go. And really the goal is to, how good of a wine can we make and along those lines, who 
are we as far as our tier goes. That’s all we’re trying to do. We’re making the same amount or 
even less wine quantity wise. The idea is to keep pushing quality up and try to reduce all of the 
stuff we don’t like to do. 
 
[00:56:45] (KS) What are your wines now? I saw that you have Chardonnay growing right here. 
 
[00:56:52] (JL) Our sort of flagship wines are the white chardonnay and to some degree 
sauvignon blanc, but mostly chardonnay. And then the red it’s what we call the Bordeaux blends, 
cabernet sauvignon, the best grape we grow, but it always needs some support, perhaps from 
merlot or cabernet franc. 
[00:57:17] (KS) And do you still grow Riesling? Or did you ever get into Riesling and all that? 
[00:57:22] (JL) Yes we’ve always grown Riesling. We still have it. We really like Riesling. 
Jonathan really likes Rielsing. I’m not sure it’s the most appropriate grape for our climate, but 
we keep playing with it. I’ve been encouraged. We might even plant a little bit more on a better 
site. The site that we have the Riesling at wasn’t the best site. 
 
[00:57:49] (KS) Is there any wines that you’ll never grow again that you had some real bombs 
with? 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
18
[00:57:55] (JL) Well, Seyval, which always made a really good wine, but we could never do any 
better than really good. It’s the nature of the grape grown at this place. That’s where I’d have to 
say climate change really took it’s toll. It was nearly ripening grape that became very early 
ripening grape. 
 
[00:58:17] (KS) We can get some crazy weather at the end of early summer sometimes. 
 
[00:58:20] (JL) It just pushed, it ripened so early, it ripened in the heat of August. If grapes ripen 
under heat they’ll never make great wine, or at least the wine that we’d like. 
 
[00:58:34] (KS) You were getting too much sugar concentration? 
 
[00:58:36] (JL) It was just that the wine lacked energy and minerality. You need to ripen under 
cool conditions for that. 
 
[00:58:45] (KS) It’s good for peaches. Good peaches in August. If they don’t pick them all. Any 
other wines that you’re growing? 
 
[00:58:59] (JL) We grow some petit manseng. You’re probably familiar with that. In fact that’s 
what I was pruning this morning. It’s a real easy grape to grow. It seems to like Virginia a lot. 
We’re still trying to figure out wine style with that one. It makes a great late harvest wine. That’s 
what we’ve done with it until recently, exclusively. The problem is there’s not much of a demand 
for sweet wines. 
 
[00:59:32] (KS) Also it maybe doesn’t have the name recognition of the other ones. 
 
[00:59:36] (JL) We sell most of it to restaurants. Sommeliers love it. But there’s only so much of 
it they can buy. That’s why we’re not planting more. 
 
[00:59:49] (KS) Anything that you really wish you could grow but has never been possible? 
 
[00:59:53] (JL) I love pinot noir, but I’m kind of glad that we can’t grow it here. Even under the 
best conditions it’s hard to grow. Nebbiolo. 
 
[1:00:09] (KS) I’ve asked other people and they’ve told me. I know the primary issues are the 
funguses and those kinds of things. What kind of, what are you seeing as the problems, the pests, 
the issues that wine growers are facing? 
 
[1:00:27] (JL) You mean in general? 
 
[1:00:30] (KS) Yeah, or just even if you’ve seen change over time. I know, for example, and 
some of the wineries have said this too, there never used to be any problem with deer, because 
rural people hunted and the populations were low. Now nobody really hunts as much and the 
populations are huge and you’re having, people are going to have to spend a lot more money on 
fencing and different way to 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
19
[1:00:54] (JL) That’s true about the hunting and the deer. I agree. We’ve always had to have a 
deer fence, starting in the early 80s. At least here there have always been a lot of deer. Bear have 
become more of a problem, but all these are, are they problems? Yes, but are they 
insurmountable? No. Probably the biggest problem we’re having is weather fluctuations. 
Farmers never like surprises. Or whether it’s hot, cold, hot, cold in the winter, which can be 
worse than just really, really, really cold, or if it’s dry, dry, dry and then a huge storm comes up, 
that’s one of our bigger problems. 
 
[1:001:43] (KS) You can’t put up a fence for 
[1:01:45] (JL) No. 
[1:01:47] (KS) To stop the weather from being crazy. Did you, I know some of the orchards last, 
was it just last spring when you had the crazy freeze, thaw when things were just about budding. 
Did you have to put any heat in the orchards or do anything like that? 
 
[1:02:05] (JL) No, we don’t do anything like that, but it was a nail biter. I thought for sure we 
were going to get nailed, but we didn’t. We got lucky. 
 
[1:02:17] (KS) So you’ve never done anything like that. You don't bring in? 
 
[1:02:20] (JL) No, the main thing is that site selection will take care of most of those kinds of 
problems. 
 
[1:02: 29] (KS) And you have a pretty good elevation here too. 
 
[1:02:30] (JL) We’re in a thermal area, so we basically don’t have late frost issues. We’ve been 
nipped in the lower part once or twice, but we’ve never had any crop loss from that. 
 
[1:02:49] (KS) You have a natural buffer. 
 
[1:02:53] (JL) This was all orchards for a reason, back in the turn of the last century. 
[1:02:58] (KS) Do you know who owned the land? 
[1:03:01] (JL) I do and I don’t. I don’t know who owned it during that time, but it was part of a 
bigger farm. I’m not sure. I think it was broken up in the late 1800s, because there’s common 
fence, stone walls. But this whole area, you can walk five miles any direction, ten miles any 
direction, it would be orchards, everywhere. I would die to see what that looked like. 
 
[1:03:32] (KS) Have you seen the picture, there’s a brochure that, you might not know him. He’s 
up on 688. I’m blanking. He does reprints of historical things that he finds. He has a brochure 
from the Leeds Manor Orchard that they would use for selling. They have a fold out panoramic 
picture that must have been taken from an airplane. I don’t know how they did it, a balloon. It’s 
shocking, amazing. Over every hillside, just apple trees, apple trees, apple trees.

[1:04:15] (JL) I have not seen that, but I can envision what it looked like. They had a cooperage 
there. A barrel making facility on site just to package all the apples. 
 
[1:04:25] (KS) We could use a cooperage now, with all these wine makers. It’s just very 
interesting to me. The continuation of the type of work. Even though it’s different, but it’s using 
the assets of the land in a very similar way, over time, repeatedly. Some part of that is very 
interesting. 
 
[1:04:49] (JL) That’s why I was asking you about Freezeland in a more historical sense. I’m 
trying to get a little more about history. I’m getting a little bit here and there, but I think there’s 
something else out there. The orchards in this area, Freezeland was actually started by former 
Confederate officers. That alone, and they all lived down in Richmond, but some, for whatever 
reason they all invested here. In the summers they’d bring their families here. That sort of thing 
is just amazing. 
 
[1:05:27] (KS) I’d be happy to share my thesis with you. I don’t think anyone’s actually ever 
read it. 
 
[1:05:34] (JL) Anything with history. The agricultural history of this area fascinates me. 
 
[1:05:37] (KS) I look at it through the lens of sort of continuation of a work culture over time 
and the changes that happen to that work over time. So the Striblings are the earliest example of 
that. Because they’ve been there for so long and had apple trees in that spot for so long. And then 
the Green across the street are their cousins. And then the Struthers. Charles Struther. The 
Struthers go back as far as the Striblings I think, almost. But they pop up in all the local, all the 
newspaper accounts and stuff. You can find some Struther getting in trouble somewhere. Every 
century there’s some new story of scandal in the Struther family. So they’re very entertaining to 
research. It’s a fascinating area. Is there any other things that we would like to clarify? Add? 
What’s the biggest challenge? For you it’s maintaining that standard of your reputation and 
trying to, as you say, never being content. 
 
[1:06:56] (JL) There’s the production, which is mostly trying to figure out a vineyard, but one 
way in that it’s pretty straightforward and easy, you can tweak things a little bit, but it’s more 
about the vineyard and making the short term and long term decisions. That’s the hard part. The 
business part is jut trying to figure out how to sell your wine with as little effort as possible. Let’s 
put it that way. We’re trying to see how far we can go with that before we get burned. 
 
[1:07:39] (KS) Before people forget that you exist. There’s a lot of inundation everywhere for 
every other product. Maybe that’s going to be your strategy. Maybe just do the opposite of what 
everyone else is doing. 
 
[1:07:57] (JL) That’s the way it has been. It’s worked out fairly well. 
 
[1:08:04] (KS) When I was talking to the sommelier he was saying that different wine makers, 
there's more, I forgot the way he phrased it, but taking about the work that you do on the vine 
versus the work that you do in the processing room. What is your, it sounds like you’re more

about site selection, the type of grapes, how you prune them, how you take care of them. How 
much do you find that you have to manipulate the wine, the juice after? 
 
[1:08:43] (JL) Manipulation is a four-letter word. We call ourselves boring wine makers. We do 
as little as we can get by with. No additions other than sulfur. We called ourselves palate based 
wine makers. We keep tasting and we make our decisions that way. We’re also lazy wine 
makers. We don’t do much of anything. 
 
[1:09:18] (KS) But not actually, because you’ve done all the work leading up to it. 
 
[1:09:19] (JL) Yeah, I mean, but wine doesn’t make it self and we have to get involved to some 
degree, but we try to reduce our involvement as much as we can. 
 
[1:09:29] (KS) Leave no trace, like the Park Service says. 
 
[1:09:33] (JL) Yeah, it’s about letting the wine express itself. As we say, it’s not our job, well we 
care, but it’s not our job to make flavor, or make aroma. That’s what comes from the vineyard. 
Our job is to make balance. And that’s what we’ll be doing soon with our blending trials. It’s all 
about textural, palate balance. It’s not about aroma and flavor. 
 
[1:10:05] (KS) I think we weren’t recording when you were explaining it to me, but in the room 
that we’re in you’re going to play host to other wine makers and they’ll be doing blending trials? 
 
[1:10:14] (JL) Today it will just be the three of us. I’m going to sit down and taste different 
blends blind. I’ll make up the blends based on yesterday's discussions. Hopefully, I don’t know if 
it will make that decision today, but we’ll come close. And then tomorrow we’re a tasting with 
an RDV staff and we’re doing, it’s called a first-second tasting. First wine, second wine. We 
taste wine and we have, these are wines from anywhere, from any kind, but you taste the same, 
same winery, same year, but two wines that they made from the same grape, same style. One is 
their prestigious wine and one is their entry level wine. First wine, second wine. We taste them 
blind and can you tell the difference? Yes, you can tell the difference, but which one? You’d be 
surprised by how sometimes it’s hard to tell. But then you also learn what are the aspects of the 
wine that they consider the first versus the second. 
 
[1:11:32] (KS) And you’re tasting other people’s wine? 
 
[1:11:35] (JL) Yeah. And we’ll often do, like last week we did 2011 vintage Bordeaux blend. 
Ten wines and we tasted them all blind. And we did throw in our wines, RDV’s wines, throw 
them into the mix. It’s not a contest. It’s just to try to understand how your wines show the other 
wines. 
 
[1:12:02] (KS) Is there a point where you’ll decide you don’t want to make wine anymore? Or 
you’ll hand it over to somebody? Or, what do you think?

[1:12:12] (JL) I’m sure making plans for that, but, like I say, it’s, my motto in that is death is my 
exit plan if I’m lucky. I realize that I might not be that lucky. If things happen and I can’t do, or 
I’ll do it until I can’t, but I’m already starting to make plans. 
 
[1:12:45] (KS) It has an amazing reputation, so yes it would be. Who are some of the people that 
you have mentored. I know that your name has come up a lot. 
 
[1:12:57] (JL) The folks at RDV have both, the owner and Josh Grainer, were here. That’s why 
we’re so close. And then there’s a fellow that started a vineyard. He hasn’t produced wine yet, 
because his vines aren’t old enough yet. He’s right here in Linden, named Dominic Feresie. 
They’ll be producing in a couple more years. He just has baby vines. There’s Jeff at Glen Manor. 
He worked here for 12 years. 
 
[1:13:41] (KS) I think both the folks at Chrysalis and Cana both said that you had been helpful to 
them. 
 
[1:13:52] (JL) Well, I taught classes for many years. If people want to come and talk and ask 
questions, set up an appointment. I don’t charge. If I have to go. I don’t do it much anymore, but 
if somebody really wants me to see a site I’ll take payment in wine. That way I also get an idea 
of what kind of wines they like and how much they value my service. I just say pay me in wine. 
 
[1:14:27] (KS) And see what they come up with. I think we’re good. Unless there’s anything that 
you wanted to add.
