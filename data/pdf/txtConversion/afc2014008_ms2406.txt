Dear Dr Manoney;
 
Your prescriptions arrived yesterday,  thank you for
 
sending theme
 since we were almost out oi  the pronestyl I had asked
 
Dr Koch to give me enough of them to get by, and he had done so.
 d
/e
 
were also completely out of the pavabid 150 mg tid from Dr Rivera,  so
 
Dr Koch gave me a refill on those also.
 
If this sounds as tho my brother is getting hit or miss
 
care,  I have had little time,  since  his arrival here around Thanks 
giVil
lg
 
to get into the complicate d structure of doctors.
 I started in on his
 
skin cancers,  and they were extensive and long overdue for attention.
 
He had the surgery on last Tuesday,  came through fine, and is home nov;.
 
Dr Koch did a large skin graft on his chin.
 We are to go back on Monday
 
for the stitches to be removed, and if cleared by Dr Koch he and I are
 
flying to California d
iednesday to spend the holidays with my younger

i

doctor,  so I feel secure in  taking John into strange medic al  territ
/
 
when I really do not know the score about hi-1.
 
I do not even know who Dr Rivera is, nor what this
 
medicine is supposed to correct but I bet I find out.
 Sad to say,  Joha':
 
two sons are lacking in concern for their father,  and with hargare t 
Loraax's long illness and death in the forefront of all their lives,
 
John has definately been neglected,  in all areas.
 
I have been talking with my brother, Alan, and with
 
our sister, and we will soon make a decision about how to alter this
 
situation.
 i
dar aret Lomax had made defin te her intention of brooking
 
no sug estiO-is from the Lomax family,  and I fear that th e son
 Joe, has
 
adopted this feeling.
 
Don't really know how to proceed, doctorwiSe.
 I an
 
sure that you could refer me to a good cardiologist in Luebock, but be-
fore I make a final decision about keeping John here with me there wi l
l
 
ork out.
 So unles s you advise me differently
 
so a lot of things to w
 
I shall continue with the medication
 schedule

JOHN A. LOMAX JR. MEMORIAL
 15 December 1974
 
AUTREY HOUSE, HOUSTON
 
BEN RAMEY:
 Dear Friends;  We have gathered today to put our
 
memories in order and to take joy from the fact that John Lomax
 
Jr., lived;
 
of the root
 
the windows
 
to celebrate the ways in which his life was a part
 
and branch of our own.
 His family have chosen that
 
here should be open to the traffic of a busy Houston
 
street and to rows of majestic live oaks, because John was so
 
much a part of all that was good and humane in the growth of the
 
city of Houston, and because he was wide-rooted, many-branched,
 
on
 
and ever/green as the oak; and we shall not, any of us, soon for-
get the cool, broad shelter he made for us in life, and his
 
vigorous view of Texas  origins.
 
CHISOLM TRAIL
 (Frank Davis on sound)
 
BR:
 John was not an antiquarian with a professional reverence
 
for the past; instead he had a wry appreciation of the way that
 
history makes itself felt in us; and he was a participant in the
 
history of our times who went after his part in it like a man
 
killing snakes.
 John was a little long in the tooth for active
 
service in World War Two; but nothing could have kept him out of
 
uniform in what he felt was a war for human decency.
 He rose,
 
in what was called the Muscle Buster program, to be a Lieutenant
 
in the Navy.
 He said once that his family had strong genes,
 
2
 
talking of his grandfather, James Avery Lomax, who got sixteen
 
children of two wives over a thirty-eight year span, and of his
 
grandmother, Susan Cooper Lomax, who bore eleven children and
 
raised ten more from various sources.
 Paying tribute to the
 
scholarly achievements of his father and his brother Alan, John
 
said of himself:  "My bit is mainly to sing our folk songs  .
 
my style is to sing them like they were originally sung or
 
collected .
 .
 •
 I alter all song versions  .
 .
 .
 to suit my style."
 
Here's one he altered a little more.
 Pete Wheeler.
 
PETE:
 RIVERS OF TEXAS
 
BR:
 Born in Austin June 14, 1907.  As John might have said, if
 
he could have been patient for five more days, he would have
 
made it in for a holiday.
 Raised in Austin for ten years and
 
taught by his mother, Bess Lomax, another remarkable woman, who
 
gave her children Latin to learn their ABC's by, John's first
 
experience of public school was to be admitted to the seventh
 
grade in Highland Park, Illinois, when the family moved to Chicago.
 
They came back to Austin and John went on through the University
 
of Texas and to the Harvard Business School.
 He joined the Re-
construction Finance Corporation in 1932, and then moved on to
 
a bank in Corpus Christi, and the bank folded up around his ears.
 
He's told me many times of that last day when the doors were
 
locked and the depositors were beating at the windows like bees
 
drawn back to a ruined hive.
 I think it gave him a permanent,
 
I
 
3
 
physical sense of the many ways that man's best efforts can be
 
brought to nothing.  His own business career, after experience
 
in numerous enterprises -
-
 he once managed a bowling palace
 
was succeSS.  His partner is here to talk to us about John Lomax
 
as a businessman and a builder.
 Earl Gilbert.
 
GILBERT
 
BR:  Many of us knew him as a sportsman and exemplar of the
 
healthy body with the sound mind.
 To help us remember him in
 
that light, Jerry Sampson.
 
SAMPSON
 
BR:
 Some of us had the good fortune to have the threads of our
 
life cross John's many times.  One of those fortunate ones is
 
going to talk to us of John as husband and father.
 John Henry
 
Faulk.
 
JOHN HENRY FAULK
 
John Pollock:
 MIDNIGHT SPECIAL
 
BR:
 That was John Pollock, and his version of "Midnight Special"
 
owes much to our friend.
 John found many ways to touch the lives
 
of others that transcend any categorization save that of friend-
ship.
 Dr. Frank Rivers.
 
FRANK RIVERS
 
BR:  When John Pollock was singing "Midnight Special", I remembered
 
that John Lomax was quietly determined, and we all know the force
 
of his quiet determination, that such songs, and the often namer-
4
 
less, mostly exploited, always enduring human beings who made
 
them, should have justice in the tally of folk lore, if nowhere
 
else.
 He was the most influential figure in the founding of the
 
Houston Folklore Society.
 In it, he was father and elder brother
 
to us all.
 I want to read a couple of things he wrote, to remind
 
us all how he could look back to misery and forward to hope.
 
At the dedication of the State Historical Marker at the
 
grave of Blind Lemon Jefferson -
-
 a marker that John had labored
 
long and hard to see built -
-
 he said:
 
I
'
 
Lemon Jefferson imagined, and perhaps secretly hoped
 
for a magnificent funeral.
 In view of this man's humble funeral
 
and of his grave before us, unattended, unkept and unmarked these
 
38 years past, his wish has been ironic.
 It is fitting that this
 
strong desire of Blind Lemon Jefferson, the front-runner of all
 
our great blues singers, be at last fulfilled.  .
 .  This monument
 
and marker locate the place he  returned, but his greatest memorial
 
lives on forever in the melodies he made."  And he sang Blind
 
Lemon's song with the verse:
 
"Well, there's one kind favor I
'll ask of you
 
Please see that my grave is kept clean .
 .
 
John's  involvement, his love affair, with the Blues was life-
long, just as was his entanglement with the songs of the cattle
 
trail and the prison camp.
 He was a major element in two movies
 
about celebrated blues singers of Texas -
-
 a major element up to
 
A -
 
5
 
and including the financing; and I don't doubt that Les Blank,
 
with whom he worked on those two films, could tell us how crucial
 
that element is.
 
Here's what he wrote about a prison song he made us all to
 
know:
 
I
  
Sixty years ago the Brazos bottom land around Sugarland
 
was a waving cane brake of hellish heat worked by convict labor,
 
hired privately at 50c per day, per head.
 The cruelty of this
 
inhuman system became apparent, was eliminated by law -
-
 the
 
cane fields are no more.
 But the taste of the sweat and blood,
 
the lash of the whip, and the overtones of savage emotion, still
 
linger in the slow sweep of the cane knives in "Ain't No More
 
Cane on This Brazis".
 
ALAN:  AIN'T NO MORE CANE...
 
BR:
 I spoke of two celebrated blues singers enshrined in film
 
by John Lomax's efforts.
 Both these men are here today. Mance
 
Lipscomb .
 
MANCE LIPS COMB:
 
BR:
 Nothing to say about this next man but to call his name:
 
Lightning Hopkins.
 
LIGHTNIN' HOPKINS:
 ONE KIND FAVOR
 
BR:
 John would have liked, and the family want, those of you
 
who want to remember in company for a little longer, to come by
 
6
 
the home place at 6428 Vanderbilt; and we remind you lovingly
 
that there is the
 
John A. Lomax Jr. Memorial Fund
 
to carry on some of John's activities, to which contributions
 
may be sent d o Camilla Hom e, 8146 River, Houston, Texas
 77017.
 
We're going to end our service in memory of our friend with
 
a coupld of the folk hymns he helped to give a longer life,  for
 
John, in his sturdy way, was a deeply-believing man.

Dear Brothel
' and LO.aieei
 
I an going to send this in an envelope that I addres. ad away
 
back In October when.! had a letter from Louise saying
 you  ad
 
met up your h0us h02
.d pods apa1n,
 K I i*a t to songratulate yo*.
 
And congratulations are still
. in Order,  I think;  for except to have
 
y
our children well and be av1n  the eo.t necessary thing is to have
 
a home.
 I know Lo is* will be sany times as han y, snd e v
en when
 
yo,2 are out of town it to nioe to look back to.
 
V. had an especially e eoe etu1 OhrI*t ae.
 We always have  ade
 
it a big celebration;  but this year Shirley' was at home and It
 
nearly takes c%trley to sake a Ohristmae
 AM t
*e  knowledge that
 
John was l*avihm at once, perhaos not  p&in really to live at home
 
ead• an all re lize how scarce the tiiee are  -
rowing when we can
 
o,eul
.t on bein
.fr. t
ogether.
 Shirley was hers a week, and Alan nearly
 
two weeks, and we had what Bess oalla a Ws0rumpeheo

 So far

NEXT MONTHS MEETING IS TUESDAY MAY 1
 
NOTICE FROM THE EXECUTIVE.
 
The HFS Executive has recently received the following proposal:-
"
 propose  that the John A. Loma x , Jr . Memor
ia l Fun d aut
hor
ise  the  
Executive of the Houston Folklore Society to purchase,  for the Society,  a
 
small, table model, printing press  (A.B.Dick 321 or similar). The press
 
would initially be used to print the Cotton Patch Rag.  Its cost could be
 
subsidised by doing small  printing jobs for other non-profit making groups
 
in the Houston area. A longer term use would be to publish books,  booklets
 
and pamphlets on items of folklore,  folksong and  folkcrafts.
 
The estimated  initial cost of this project is about $1000.00 with
 
expected monthly costs of about $25.00.  The expected income from the project
 
is about $50.00 per month.
 
The Lomax Fund was started with the intention of being used,"...in
 
his memory for the furtherance of the folklore which was one of his life-
long  interests and activities.". John was a founder member of the Houston
 
Folklore Society and the Society exists with the stated aim of furthering
 
the cause of folklore in Houston.  I can think of no more fitting tribute or
 
memorial to John than to have, on everything that the Society publishes,  the
 
legend, "Printed on the John A.  Lomax, Jr. Memorial  Printing Press". This
 
will act as a constant reminder to those who knew him and will bring his name
 
to the attention of those who did not."
 
The Lomax  Fund Committee is meeting this week to discuss the proposal.
 
Also there will be an open meeting on the subject on Thursday, April  19,  at
 
3804 Villanova. The meeting will open at 7.30 with business starting promptly
 
at 8.00. We urge all members of the Society to attend, especially past members
 
of the Executive and any other  interested parties.
 
EDITORIAL.
 
Throughout this year we have been plagued with printing problems of
 
one kind or another and  I made the above proposal  to the Lomax Fund Committee
 
in order to find a way that the Society could continue to publish the Rag
 
without further hinderance.
 
In order to refresh our minds a little about John A.  Lomax, Jr.  I have
 
put together this mini-Rag.  It consists of excerpts from articles that first
 
appeared in the special Memorial  Issue of the Rag published shortly after his
 
untimely death late  in 1974.
 
CALENDAR FOR APRIL.
 
There will be the usual Wednesday Singalongs at Rudyards,  crafts on
 
alternate Mondays  (
16 and 30)  and Men Of Houston/Yellow Rose Morris practices
 
every Sunday.  The weekend of 27/28/29 will be the Austin Friends of Tradition-
al Music Festival at Zilker Hillside Theatre. Also on April 28 there is the
 
Highland Games at Fort Bend County Fairground. Call HFS Exec.  for any details.
 
*  Men of Houston dance at Rudyards 9.00 p.m. April 21 for Easter/St. Georges *

JOHN A. LOMAX.  JR.
 JUNE 14.  1907 -
 DECEMBER 12,  1974.
 
"This special  issue of The Cotton Patch Rag  is our way of honoring  the
 
unique man who was one of the  founders of our  Houston Folklore Society and a
 
staunch friend of folklore collectors and preservers everywhere."
 
'Back in the early fifties I (Ed Badeauxi  was scrambling around
 
Houston hunting for audiences to regale with folksongs. Whenever I found one
 
I would hesitatingly call up John to see  if he would sing with me, always sure
 
that by then he would have tired of the game and turn me down. But he never
 
did.  In fact,  he started  in scrambling a little himself and calling on me to
 
help him out.  And we enlisted a whole string of others over the years: Howie
 
Porper, Grace Cresswell, Jim and Kyla Bynum, Jimmie Lee Grubbs,  Lightnln'
 
Hopkins, Mance Lipscomb,  Pete Rose, Jim McConnell, Frank Davis,  and on and
 
on."
 
"We have heard about John Lomax's death.  It is sad to see the passing
 
of an era."
 
"Though Margaret said we were putting  the cart before the horse, John,
 
Ed Badeaux, Chester Bower,  and  I [
Howard Belikoff]  started the Houston Folk-
lore Society around 1951-52 or so, because we wanted to catch onto all  the
 
folk things around us."
 
"John was a strong, honest man. None of us who knew him will  forget
 
hl*."
 
"John told her he was a Bank Examiner, which didn't make much of an
 
impression and remarked that he was on his way home to Austin. Her response
 
was that her only positive view of the place was that her father always said
 
that there was only one man at the University of Texas worth his salt, John
 
Avery Lomax. Her attitude suggested that this young man had probably never
 
heard of such a person. John drew himself up proudly and said,  "My name is
 
John Avery Lomax, Jr.". The young ladies name was Margret Marable, Mimi  to
 
her family and friends.  She eventually became Mrs. John A.  Lomax, Jr."
 
"I'll always be glad that I knew John and Mimi,  and I know that there
 
can never be anyone to fill  the gap.  But the songs help -
 a little."
 
 
 Sixty years ago the Brazos bottom land around Sugarland was a
 
waving cane brake of hellish heat worked by convict labor, hired privately at
 
SOc per day,  per head. The cruelty of this inhuman system became apparent, was
 
eliminated by law -
-
 the cane fields are no more.  But the taste of the sweat
 
and blood, the lash of the whip,  and the overtones of savage emotion, still
 
linger on in the slow sweep of the cane knives in 'Ain't No More Cane on This
 
Brazos'
.
"  
"He sang our own songs for us,  recreating the accuracy of pitch,  the
 
apparent simplicity,  the self-effacing absence of histrionics learned  first
 
in his family and then from many other singers.  Man and singer he was the real
 
thing -
-
 a living definition of American folksong."
 
"From the moment we left Houston, and for the length of the entire
 
trip, John would have a story about every town we passed. He knew about the
 
people who settled there,  where they came from, what they did,  and how they
 
contributed to the folklore of the area. This went on for the full  four hours
 
of the trip;  it was a detailed history of this area of Texas.  He told stories
 
and anecdotes that I am sure appear  in no history books.  Gregarious John got
 
these stories from the people he befriended. He loved this state and  its
 
people, and those who knew him loved him  in return V

"I remember once when a film crew was in Houston and wanted to talk to
 
John and myself. We met with the earnest young cinematographers, dispelling
 
their  fears and giving  them solid counsel  for the project they had in mind.
 
John then suggested that we  repair to the old second ward area where we could
 
take  in a show at Irene's Place that might interest all of us.
 
 
and then began the greatest game of pool  it has ever been my
 
fortune to observe. John would attempt and make  shots that would have driven
 
masters of the game to tears,  only to be topped by Sam Hopkins  in a kind of
 
imitation drunken grace and stumbling charm that was completely disarming..
 
All  the while the two men played the  'Dozens'  on each other with a mock
 
ferocity that terrified the handful  of movie men watching the game. As the
 
match neared  its completion the two men began to chuckle and snort a litt le.
 
When Lightnin'  made a final shot that brought the game to an end, John roared
 
with laughter.  'Old Lightnin'  and me shore had you guessing that time!'  was
 
John's closing remark made  through the gales of happy sounds that were
 
eminating  from our  film crew members.  John Lomax had effectively demonstrated
 
his own humanity and the humanity of people of every color,  in a short fun-
filled pool game  in a dive  in Houston's second ward."
 
"Sincerity and  integrity.  I believe those two virtues were the  things
 
that I admired  in John. When he sang a song, somehow one felt that that was
 
the way the song should be done.  He didn't change the beat or accent certain
 
phrases to simply please the crowd or because that was the way it was done on
 
a best selling  record.  Indeed,  I didn't care for many of his songs at all, but
 
I never doubted the honesty with which they were done. His songs were done
 
with a love for the songs and not to try to sell a million records.  It is
 
something that I think we would all do well to remember.
 
'And then there were my adventures with  'No Key'  (as I used to call
 
him)  Lomax.  It would go something  like this -
-
 During  rehearsals we would try
 
to play our  instruments  in accompaniment to John's singing. This proved to be
 
a rigorous exercise  in musical chairs,  with John up and us down, or vice
 
versa. To make  it short,  we very seldom,  if ever found each other!  And if we
 
did, John would  (
just to keep us honest)  change key in mid-song. So  it ended,
 
as it almost always did, with John going  it alone. And as I think about it
 
now,  it was the best i
4ay for John and  the rest of us  . . . .
 Just listen to his
 
tapes and  records,  and you will know what I mean.
 
"Ain't no more cane on de Brazos,  It's all  been ground  into molasses"
 
"After his heart attack, John complained that he couldn't remember his
 
songs,  and  it was painful  to see him resort to singing from a book.  But I
 
believe he had that licked. One night last year he was at my house with Pete
 
Wheeler. As they were leaving,  some mention was made of the classic oration
 
supposedly delivered  in the Arkansas Legislature on changing  the name of
 
Arkansas. There on our driveway,  he declaimed  the whole,  long speech.  If any
 
neighbors were listening,  I hope they enjoyed  it as much as I did."
 
"At his funeral, all of us singing:  'When my blood  runs chilly and
 
cold'  brought tears to all of our eyes,  including our older daughter who
 
remembered with nostalgia laughing so hard when John sang. John and his songs
 
stay with me strong and deep like the man he was."
 
"So long, John,  it's been good to know you"
 
All of the above was taken from the  'Special Memorial  Issue'  of the
 
Cotton Patch Rag, Volume 10,  Number 2,  February 1975,  edited by Camilla Hom e.

Listen, my Sweet, o

TO

 snr ke.
 
Since I received the wail from you first, I suppose it's
 
fair to let mine out.
 I am out some $200. direct expenEc,
 
plus my phone bill, plus
 for $25.00 (which phone
 
bills are supoosed to be
 the time comes) however),
 
plus the fact that I missed out on a pay check for missing
 
somuch time.
 I didn't think it was right for Auntie to
 
have to wait and so I paid hers.
 
For the record,  I was never told ah ut the famIly
 
flowers, who ordered, or who paid.
 After it was over I made
 
some inane remark that the red roses were surely beautiful
 
and who sent them ?
 Whomever I was s
teaking to looked at me
 
mighty funny and said:
 "Why that's the family blanket P
 
Here is the 20 bucks and kindly remit any dividends on the deal.
 
Margaret strug led with the walking flu for several
 
days after returning from  ouston and finally went to bed for
 
3 days and now has about reøovered, but her strength is not
 
back to par.
 I am fully over my cold and Johnny is about
 
over his.
 He never did really feel much effect from his
 
cold and runs us ragged over his 12 hour daily stint.
 
Deanie wrote us yesterday that she is to leRve
 
Stella in Denton the 29th after taking her there the 29th.
 
Deanie is to return to Dallas, and I hope Miss Allen comes u
 
the 1st to work on the papers as Deanie has invited.
 Stella
 
is to return to Dallas for another visit (duration not stated
 
by Deanie) and then return to Ark, via Chicago Visit).
 So,
 
evidently this will leave Deanie by herself in the not too
 
distant future.
 What should We plan ?
 It will bg typical
 
for her just not to tell us, let Stella leave and tough it
 
out.
 Let me have your views on this posthaste.
 
Uncle Allie and Aunt Mame have been planning to
 
make a trip to Florida.
 Were to go this week, but each day
 
she'd postpone a ying she didn't feel well, the weather was hod,  etc.
 
cuess the aspects have changed by now and my money says they
 
will never get away.
 
Surely hope
s you are feelin  better.
 
Love,

breaking out i
nto s
ong o
r t
elling a
 t
all
 
as he does f
requently t
o make a
 point.
 
Asked whether everyone could s
ing
 
t
he b

aid: "How
 
does t
he s
ong go? '
I
t t
akes a

even whites coming out o

ot

a

Today's r
ap i

 "another exa mple o

how b

ts another emer-
gence o
f t

Growing out o
f t

o
f b
lacks, i
t keeps and exaggerates
 
"
the basic t
rait o
f African music,
 
which  i

"On t
op o
f t
hat i
t
's extremely ag-
gressive, very l
oud, very f
orceful and
 
l
oud," Mr. Lomax said. "Forceful
 
music comes f
rom f

Even with t
he r
ap s
cene, Mr. Lo-
max s
aid, he i
s heartened by an ap-
parent  r
eawakening  o
f  i
nterest
 
among b

b
lack middle c

achieved t

oster a

hat i
s under
 
way i

Carolina.
 
"There's a f
olklore movement a
ll
 
over t

lace," he said. "When 1
 was
 
r
unning t
he r

t was me and
 
Burl I

That i

t
hough t
he "middle-class carriers o

i
terate culture have certainly con-
quered t
he p
lanet."
 
"The question now," Mr. Lomax
 
said, "
is whether t

W P
AcsioN FOR FOLK S

By Joseph F

My f
ather, John A. Lomax, J
r.,
 
had a
 deeply set passion f
or f

f l
i
felong s

and importance f

A. Lomax, S

igged up i

A Ford.
 
To my knowledge, my f
ather d
id
 
not g
ive a
 public concert before
 
1950. P
rior t
o t
hat t
ime, he had not
 
sung i
n public because he f
elt h
is
 
s
inging s
tyle would not be i

c-

rior t
o t
hat de-
but and c
onsistently a
fterwards, he
 
a
lways s
ang a

never what t
he public expected and

urprises people now when

But, c

Far more important t

im was
 
Lomax Memorial Concert
 
The Houston Folklore Society i

 and an o

Lomax, who d

ntroduce a
 
wider audience t

s
inging a

young f
olksingers and helping
 
underwrite p
rojects such as

Once he wrote an  explanation
 
o
f h
is s
inging s
tyle:
 
•  .  .  I
 esti mate some 95 % o
f r
eal f
olk
 
songs were made up as unaccompanied
 
songs and a
 l
arge p
roportion were l
ater
 
collected as such. Certainly t

he guarded t

ikewise t

is l
ine heaving; t
he penitentiary work
 
gangs, with o
r without a

improvised s

For my part I

JOHN A
. LOMAX JR. MEMORIAL SERVICE
 15 December 1974
 
AUTREY HOUSE, HOUSTON
 
Dear Friends;  We have gathered today to put our memories in
 
order and to take joy from the fact that John Lomax Jr., lived;
 
to celebrate the ways in which his life was a part of the root
 
and branch of our own.  His family has chosen that the windows
 
here should be open to the traffic of a busy Houston street
 
and to rows of  majestic live oaks, because John was so much
 
a part of all that was good and humane in the growth of the
 
city of Houston, and because he was wide-rooted, many-branched,
 
and evergreen as the oak; and we shall not, any of us, soon
 
forget the cool, broad shelter he made for us in life, and his
 
vigorous view of Texas origins.
 
John was not an antiquarian with a professional reverence for
 
the past; instead he had a wry appreciation of the way that
 
history makes itself felt in us; and he was a participant in
 
the history of our times who went after his part in it like
 
a man killing snakes.  John was a little long in the tooth for
 
active service in World War Two; but nothing could have kept
 
him out of uniform in what he felt was a war for human decency.
 
He rose, in what was called the Muscle Buster program, to be
 
a Lieutenant in the Navy.
 He said once that his family had
 
strong genes, talking of his grandfather, James Avery Lomax,
 
who got sixteen children of two wives over a thirty-eight year
 
span, and of his grandmother, Susan Cooper Lomax, who bore
 
eleven children and raised ten more from various sources.
 
Paying tribute to the scholarly achievements of his father and
 
his brother Alan, Jo h
n.said of himself:
 "My bit is mainly to
 
sing our folk songs .
 .
 .
 my style is to sing them like they
 
were originally sung or collected .
 .
 .
 I alter all song
 
versions .
 .
 .
 to suit my style."
 
Born in Austin, June 14, 1907.
 As John might have said, if
 
he could have been patient for five more days, he would have
 
made it in for a holiday.  Raised in Austin for ten years and
 
taught by his mother, Bess Lomax, another remarkable woman,
 
who gave her children Latin to learn their ABC's by, John's
 
first experience of public school was to be admitted to the
 
seventh grade in Highland Park, Illinois, when the family
 
moved to Chicago.
 They came back to Austin and John went on
 
through the University of Texas and to the Harvard Business
 
School.
 He joined the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in
 
1932, and then moved on to a bank in Corpus Christi, and the
 
bank folded up around his ears.  He's told me many times of
 
that last day when the doors were locked, and the depositors
 
were beating at the windows like bees drawn back to a ruined
 
hive.
 I think it gave him a permanent, physical sense of the
 
many ways that man's best efforts can be brought to nothing.
 
His own business career, after experience in numerous enter-
prises -
-
 he once managed a bowling palace -
-
 was a success.
 
Many of us knew him as a sportsman and exemplar of the
 
healthy body with the sound mind.
 
John Lomax was quietly determined, and we all know the force
 
of his quiet determination, that folksongs and the often
 
nameless, mostly exploited, always enduring human beings who
 
made them, should have justice in the tally of folklore, if
 
nowhere else.
 He was the most influential figure in the
 
founding of the Houston Folklore Society.
 In it, he was
 
Father and elder brother to us all.
 I want to read a couple
 
of things he wrote, to remind us all how he could look back
 
to misery and forward to hope.
 
At the dedication of the State Historical Marker at the
 
grave of Blind Lemon Jefferson -
-
 a marker that John had
 
labored long and hard to see built -
-
 he said:
 
4
 
"
.
 .
 .
 Lemon Jefferson imagined, and perhaps secretly hoped
 
for, a magnificent funeral.
 In view of this man's humble
 
funeral and of his grave before us, unattended, unkept and
 
unmarked these 38 years past, his wish has been ironic.
 It
 
is fitting that this strong desire of Blind Lemon Jefferson,
 
the front-runner of all our great blues singers, be at last
 
fulfilled.  .
 .
 This monument and marker locate the place he
 
returned, but his greatest memorial lives on forever in the
 
melodies he made."  And he sang Blind Lemon's song with the
 
verse:
 
"Well, there's one kind favor I'll ask of you
 
Please see that my grave is kept clean .
 .
 
John's involvement, his love affair, with the Blues was life-
long,  just as was his entanglement with the songs of the cattle
 
trail and the prison camp.
 He was a major element in two movies
 
about celebrated blues singers of Texas -
-
 a major element up to
 
and including the financing; and I don't doubt that Les Blank,
 
with whom he worked on those two films,  could tell us how crucial
 
that element is.
 
Here's what he wrote about a prison song he made us all to know:
 
Sixty years ago the Brazos bottom land around Sugarland
 
was a waving cane brake of hellish heat worked by convict labor,
 
hired privately at 500  per day, per head.
 The cruelty of this
 
inhuman system became apparent, was eliminated by law -
-
 the
 
cane fields are no more.
 But the taste of the sweat and blood,
 
the lash of the whip, and the overtones of savage emotion,  still
 
linger in the slow sweep of the cane knives in "Ain't No More
 
Cane on This Brazos".
 
John would have liked, and the family want, those of you who
 
want to remember in company for a little longer, to come by
 
the home place at 6428 Vanderbilt; and we remind you lovingly
 
that there is the
 
John A. Lomax Jr. Memorial Fund
 
to carry on some of John's activities, to which contributions
 
may be sent c/o Camilla Hom e,  8146 River, Houston, Texas
 77017.

The Texas Folklore Society deeply regrets and mourns the passing
 
of John Lomax, Jr.
 He was a strong and vital man who contributed
 
much in song and spirit to the Society's meetings.
 He will be
 
long remembered by Society members for the pleasure he has given.
 
The Lomax family has been associated with the Texas Folklore
 
Society since John Lomax, Sr., co-founded it in 1909.
 
The end
 
of a second generation of participation has come with the loss of
 
John and Mimi Lomax.
 The Society is saddened and will miss them
 
both very much.

John and I traveled many roads together and sang many songs
 
together.
 I remember one specific trip, when we were traveling
 
to Corpus Christi to do a program at Del Mar College.
 Dassia,
 
my wife, and Mimi Lomax were in the car with us.
 
From the moment we left Houston, and for the length of the
 
entire trip, John would have a story about every town we passed.
 
He knew about the people who settled there, where they came from,
 
what they did, and how they contributed to the folklore of the
 
area.
 
This went on for the full four hours of the trip;  it was a
 
detailed history of this area of Texas.
 He told stories and

antedotes that I am sure appear in no history books.

John got these stories from the people he befriended.
 He loved
 
this state and its people, and those who knew him loved him in
 
return!
 
And then there were my adventures with "No Key" (as I used to
 
call him) Lomax.
 It would go something like this
 
During rehearsals we would try to play our instruments in
 
accompaniment to John's singing.  This proved to be a rigorous
 
exercise in musical chairs, with John up and us down, or  J
isa
 
versa.  To make it short, we very seldom, if ever, found each
 
other!  And if we did, John would (
just to keep us honest)
 
change key in mid-song.
 
So it ended, as it almost always did, with John going it alone.
 
As I think about it now, it was the best way for John and the
 
rest of us  . .
.
.
 Just listen to his tapes and records, and you
 
will know what I mean.
 
HOWIE PORPER
 
1962 was a year of mixed blessing.
 I had come to Texas as a
 
bright young copywriter with the world as her oyster, but
 
when the oyster turned out less than good, I left San Antonio
 
and came to Houston with two little boys and the phone number
 
of John Lomax.
 
I had never even soken to John or Mimi before and only had
 
their number because Pete Seeger said I should look them up
 
if I ever got to Houston, but they greeted me like long lost
 
kin, took me to Folklore Society meetings in the park and in
 
general made life in this city tolerable.
 
John treated me as a real person.
 He'd ask me to sing when
 
my shyness prevented me from asking for myself.  He and Mimi
 
nursed me through more punctured romances than Tillie ever
 
dreamed possible.
 He took my sons hiking, and Mimi stuffed
 
them with goodies, accepting the roles of surrogate grand-
parents, giving love all the time.
 John was even responsible
 
for my meeting the man I eventually married -
 he had come to
 
the Folklore Society to meet John, not me.
 
I'll always be glad that I knew John and Mimi, and I know
 
that th re can never be anyone to fill the gap they left in
 
my life.
 But the songs help -
 a little.

John Lomax passed away from us the other day.
 
We marked his going with songs and words of

He touched all of us in some way -
 a room full
 
of friends and a family who loved him.
 
He was our big brother,
 
He taught us to sing.
 
His strength made us thrill when his voice
 
shook the room.
 
He was our big brother,
 
He taught us to sing.
 
He shared stories and songs of the past with us.
 
He was our big brother,

He and Mimi encouraged the young -

He was our big brother,

There is no good way that I know of to capture John Lomax on
 
paper.
 My words are weak and paint pictures in shades of black
 
and gray.
 Perhaps if alot of his friends write their memories,
 
something of substance will emerge.
 I would like to write down
 
my own memories for Joey and for Johnny III and also for myself
 
in appreciation of John and Margaret and all they both meant
 
for me over these years.
 
After they made Johnny L
.  they broke the mold, I keep hearing
 
myself saying and meaning it.  Here in the mid-seventies we are
 
in an identity flux.
 Both sexes dress alike, faded jeans, long
 
hair, men's shirts.
 And thanks to Freud we are all conscious of
 
both our maleness and femaleness (or vice versa).
 But John was
 
one of that vanishing breed, the All Man.
 You can still find
 
other ALL Man types out in the boondocks (particularly southern
 
and Texas boondocks.)  They work as county sheriffs, cops,
 
prison guards, as professional athletes, etc.
 But John was
 
atypical even of that breed.
 For he was All Man with passions.
 
At least two of them.
 John's passions were for handball and
 
for folksongs (and I've always felt, but have no proof, that
 
they should be listed in that order.)
 
John's passions were fused.
 He fondled a handball with the
 
same tenderness he sang a cowboy lullaby; he sand a worksong
 
with the strength he exhibited on the court.
 Back in the early
 
fifties I was scrambling around Houston hunting for audiences
 
to regale with folksongs.  Whenever I found one I would hesita-
tingly call up John to see if he would sing with me, always
 
sure that by then he would have tired of the game and turn me
 
down.
 But he never did.
 In fact, he started in scrambling a
 
little himself and calling on me to help him out.
 And we
 
enlisted a whole string of others over the years:
 Howie Porper,
 
Grace Cresswell, Jim and Kyla Bynum, Jimmie Lee Grubbs, Lightnin'
 
Hopkins, Marice Lipscomb, Pete Rose, Jim McConnell, Frank Davis,
 
and on and on.
 
The Houston Folklore Group was our main outlet (it is now
 
"
Society", but we were far too politically progressive back
 
8
 
then to have any truck with something called a "society"), and
 
it remained John's primary outlet as long as he lived.
 It kept
 
us honest and active, and I hope it is still serving a new gen-
eration of singers and pickers as well as it served us.
 
But I was trying to make some kind of a living back then.
 L
3o
 
for me our Alley Hootenanny in 1960 and the subsequent two
 
Hootenannies that played Cullen Auditorium (and previewed in
 
Corpus and Austin) and the folksong series at the Jewish Com-
munity Center were my primary interests.  Especially the second
 
Cullen Hoot, for by 1963 we were riding the crest of the national
 
folksong craze, and the audience poured in, filling the auditor-
ium, and we had a couple of thousand people hanging onto our
 
every note.
 I must admit that I was impressed by both the size
 
of the crowd and the fact that we were in the vanguard of what
 
was "happening".
 But John didn't look on that program as any-
thing special.
 As a matter of fact, I have always suspected
 
that if John ever had a high point through those years, it was
 
reached during the fifties, the year that the national handball
 
tournament was held in Houston, and John promoted several of us
 
to sing for their closing night banquet.
 That was the only time
 
I ever saw John's two passions truly joined.
 I believe (but
 
would not swear) that the banquet was held at Ye Olde College
 
Inn.
 I do remember being scared
. as hell at offering our rather
 
esoteric entertainment to that audience.
 But I also remember
 
John bouncing around the place happy as a kid in a toy factory,
 
or as a CIA agent who has just broken the Russian code.
 
For me John always personified folksinging as art and recreation.
 
His father had completely torpedoed the traditional boundaries
 
of the folklore of his day.
 (
John, Sr. had not given one damn
 
about version one over versions two, three, and four, but thought
 
that the songs were beautiful and meaningful and should be sung
 
and heard--so he and Alan would combine versions to produce the
 
most complete, singable one.  And so John, Jr.  cared not a rap
 
for academic recognition or monetary status.
 It was immaterial
 
to him whether or not an audience had paid to hear him sing.
 
And he cared not for their expertise.  John's loyalties were only
 
to the songs, and he was true to them always.
 And he breathed
 
life into them everytime he opened his mouth to sing.  John's
 
coarse, leathery voice and the strength of his personality fit
 
some of the songs as I have never heard anyone else fit them.
 
"The Gray Goose", "Take a Whiff on Me",  "Do Lord Remember Me",
 
"All the Baby Chickens", and "Ain't No More Cane on the Brazos"--
these were peculiarly and particularly John's turf.  And once
 
you heard his version,any subsequent performance--even by an
 
Ives or a Seeger--seemed superfluous.  And especially this was
 
true of "
John Henry".
 
I heard John sing "
John Henry" innumerable times over the years.
 
Yet I never heard him do it exactly the same way twice, nor did
 
it ever have the same emotional impact, although it was always
 
moving, always an experience to hear him sing it.
 But the most
 
memorable performance I remember was on a program at the Jewish
 
Community Center in the mid-fifties.
 Ben Ramey was on hand as
 
a fund raiser (we wanted to buy a Folklore Group tape recorder),
 
and we combined a live concert (
John, Howie, and myself) with
 
films of Josh White, Burl Ives, and Pete Seeger.
 At the height
 
of the live part of the program the houselights went down to
 
John's "
John Henry."  Howie was accompanying John on guitar, and
 
i on banjo.
 In the semi-darkness the little boy "no bigger than
 
the palm of your hand" suddenly began breathing, and before our
 
ears he grew to manhood and put his life and virility on the line
 
pitted against the white man's technology.
 I got so into the
 
thing that I had to think about tapping my foot.  When it ended
 
and the lights came up, there was no applause.
 I blinked the
 
tears from my eyes to see why.  Women were bawling openly,
 
men (who must, of course, project toughness at all times) were
 
sitting with averted eyes and were busy clearing several pounds
 
of phlegm from their bronchial passages.
 I have attended and
 
participated in a fair amount of performances before and since.

But personally I cannot remember another moment which approached
 
that one in emotional power.  John's version of "John Henry"
 
contained the word "nigger" in many places.
 Usually Ezra
 
Schacht and others would lecture John about using the word on
 
a public performance.
 But that night not a soul mentioned it.
 
John used to get alot of static about his use of the word
 
"nigger."  Well meaning static, true.
 But I never heard John
 
use the word in an insulting or belittling way.
 He used it
 
sociologically as Mark Twain had used it in Huckleberry Finn.
 
Blacks, especially country blacks, used to call each other
 
"nigger" all the time, in the same way whites call each other
 
motherfucker or sonuvabitch.
 I could never comfortably use
 
the word myself, although even then I felt that nigger was
 
kinder than the then socially acceptable equivalent,  "nig-ra."
 
(
That word sounded obscene everytime I ever heard it used,
 
even when Lyndon Johnson used it in presenting the case for
 
civil rights legislation.)  But I never minded John's use of
 
"nigger  never knew it to offend a black (though it offended
 
many a white liberal), and never joined in the pressure on John
 
to quit using it.
 John did gradually ease up on using the word,
 
I have heard.
 
Politically John was pretty conservative, I suspect, though
 
how conservative I am not exactly sure, for I was far too
 
fond of John to ever get him into a serious political discus-
sion.
 I respected John's opinions though, and I think he re-
spected mine.
 He used to delight in singing anti-Roosevelt
 
parodies, and it always amused me that these musical slanders
 
came not from rightwingers of the 1930's,
 but from the dedicated
 
left.
 Specifically from the Almanac Singers: Pete, Bess, Woody,
 
Lee, and others.
 The songs were written during that brief period
 
before Hitler broke his nonaggression pact with Stalin, when the
 
left was poignantly anti-war and needled Roosevelt for helping
 
Britain.  John seemed to be sincerely devoted to the idea of
 
peace though, no matter what his politics were.
 He took to
 
Ed McCurdy's "Last Night I Had the Strangest Dream" like the
 
proverbial duck to water.  And during Korea and during Vietnam,
 
and
. during the years between, John would have us end program af-
ter program with it.  And John would sing the lead with the full
 
force of his virile, WASP power, conducting the audience with
 
his waving arms, and the song in John's hands was indeed a mov-
ing end to an evening.
 
John's voice was a rather unique instrument, as coarse and
 
pock-marked and as strong and masculine as himself.
 I figured
 
that such a blunt, unaffected instrument just had to be a shock
 
to your average middleclass Houstonian of the fifties and sixties,
 
weaned as they all were on bel canto. 
And so, to help John
 
bridge this gap I always had him accompanied on the programs I
 
produced, even though I personally preferred to hear him a cape? -
10, and know he preferred to sing that way.
 I honestly believe
 
that it did help make our audiences accept John.
 Most of the
 
time he agreed graciously to our accompaniment, though once in a
 
while he would insist on singing alone.
 Needless to say, when
 
he insisted, he won.
 Over many years of accompanying John
 
I learned to appreciate his really unique musical sense.
 John
 
seemed to many to be constantly shifting keys in mid-performance.
 
But he only did this when he was nervous, or when one of us
 
tried to put him in a key that was comfortable for us rather than
 
right for him.
 Then John would very likely transpose midway
 
through, sliding into a more comfortable key.  When he was in his
 
usual form, and if you let him pick his own key, he would stay
 
in that key not only during that performance, but would choose
 
the same key months, even years later.  John sang "Do Lord Remem-
ber Me" in the key of G on the first occasion I met him, a party
 
Harold Belikoff gave for the Weavers on a Sunday in March, 195 0 .
 
And John was still singing the song in the key of G in 1964, on
 
his solo concert on our J.C.C. folksong series.
 
I don't want to go very far into John's family life, because
 
11
 
that was his and Margaret's private domain.
 But I do think it
 
is appropriate to say a few words about Margaret here.
 John
 
Seeger, Pete's older brother, once told me that Pete would not
 
have been what he was without Toshi, and knowing Toshi I believe
 
him.  And I believe that John would not have been possible with-
out Margaret.
 They were a real couple, such as you don't often
 
see these days.
 Margaret was indefatigable and created the home
 
and family environment which enabled John to go out and play his
 
handball and sing his folksongs.  And Margaret went to her fair
 
share of Folklore Group meetings and concerts, usually bringing
 
her knitting with her so as to fully utilize her time.
 Margaret
 
was the type that worked day and night, for John, for her kids,
 
for the rest of the family, for her alma mater, for her church,
 
and for numerous other causes she took to her breast.
 I was
 
stunned to hear of her death in June of 1973,
 and it is a testa-
ment to Joey and to the family and friends that John was able
 
to survive Margaret by a year and a half.
 
I missed the memorial service for John by one week.
 But I got
 
a vivid description of the proceedings from those who were there.
 
Mance spoke, Lightriin' sang, and so did Alan and Bess and Hally
 
Wood.  And they played a tape of John singing, and everyone
 
there sang along.  Those of us who were fortunate enough to have
 
heard John over the years will have our own favorite memories of
 
him.
 Some who never heard him will perhaps discover his Folkways
 
album, which, like these words, only shows John in shades of
 
black and gray, but that is far better than not knowing him at
 
all.  The vacuum at his death is still not fully apparent to me,
 
for in my view John was the folk equivalent of a national asset,
 
and his death is comparable to the sudden disappearance of the
 
Grand Canyon.
 In fact, I think I prefer not to admit our loss
 
at all, but to just go on pretending that John is still over
 
there in West University Place, waiting, should I ever want to
 
come back to Houston to start promoting folksong concerts again.
 
I think that is all I can accept at this particular moment of
 
my life.
 
ED BADEAUX
 
John was an unselfish pleasure-giver with his songs and an
 
inspiration to us all.
 And many an aspiring folksinger felt
 
that a word of praise from him was as encouraging as applause
 
from an auditorium.
 
After his heart attack, John complained that he couldn't remem-
ber his songs, and it was painful to see him resort to singing
 
from a book.  But I believe he had that licked.
 One night
 
last year he was at my house with Pete Wheeler.  As they were
 
leaving, some mention was made of the classic oration supposedly
 
delivered in the Arkansas Legislature on changing the name of
 
Arkansas.  There on our driveway, in good voice, with expression
 
and gestures, he declaimed the whole, long speech.
 If any
 
neighbors were listening, I hope they enjoyed it as much as I
 
did.
 
LANE GOLDSMITH
 
To this day, t
Boere have been two high points in my life.
 One was
 
the nearly three years I spent in Nashville, learning about myself,
 
and the other, the one year I spent serving the Lomax family,
 
helping John on the road to recovery.
 There will be many stories
 
in this tribute to John, about his kindness to people, his love
 
for Mimi, and other aspects, that make up John A. Lomax, Jr., so
 
I am going to talk about things that John liked.  What John liked
 
can be wrapped up in one word, and that is competition. John
 
thrived on competition--in his business and especially in his
 
sports.
 I never saw John play handball, but I have been told he
 
was murder on the court.
 But I can speak firsthand about John's
 
love for the game "Pounce," a card game sometimes called double
 
solitaire.
 "Pounce" is a card game that the Lomaxes played when
 
they were all young, and Shirley Lomax Mansell told me that
 
12
 
watching John A. Lomax and his four kids: Shirley, John, Alan,
 
and Bess  playing this game was a sight to behold.
 Laughing,
 
shouting, arguing, and it was all because each had the desire
 
to win, but to win and have fun doing it.
 My John used to
 
murder me at this game, and he was very nice about me losing.
 
But when I beat him, he became a friendly tiger, and he wanted
 
a chance to get it back.
 John taught me inner strength, and I
 
will be forever grateful that God gave me that year with John
 
A. Lomax, Jr.

THE CASE OF THE UNACCOMPANIED FOLK SINGER
 
By John A. Lomax
 
This article is in no way an apology for nor in defense of
 
unaccompanied singing, which is my style, but is more of an
 
explanation of it.
 
I estimate some 9
5% of real folksongs were made up as unaccom-
panied songs and a large proportion were later collected as such.
 
Certainly this is true of the work song category; the working
 
cowboy's hands were fully occupied as he guarded the herds,
 
likewise the sailor had no place for accompaniment during his
 
line heaving; the penitentiary work gangs, with or without a
 
song leader, improvised songs only with oral rhythm.
 For my
 
part I feel that these are among the best folksongs, the meat
 
and potatoes so to speak, and they can be resung truer and
 
better if done unaccompanied.
 
Accepting the premise that the song came first, is it not
 
important that it be kept foremost?  To me every word of a song
 
is essential to assure the full impact on the audience.
 The
 
emotional theme of a mood song or the powerful narrative of a
 
ballad are sufficient for my taste, and I wish them fully to
 
reach my listeners.
 Most of the great folksingers as Leadbelly,
 
Burl, Mance, Lightnin', Pete, and many others use accompaniment,
 
but artfully and usually subdued.
 On the other hand, I heartily
 
agree with the thought I recently heard on the radio:  "
If the
 
words of a song are not understandable, the singer would have
 
been better to have stayed in bed."  In retrospect, I recall
 
countless times, it seems, when I have unsuccessfully strained
 
to catch the words of a good song but due to the volume of the
 
accompaniment, could not.  And, Lord!  That interminable tuning!
 
It tests the patience of even the best audience;
 an unaccom-
panied singer would be going way down the road during the "tuning
.
 
gap."
 
A final point concerns numerous songs with unique melodies which
 
defy accompaniment.
 Often the singer will distort the melody,
 
to the song's detriment, in order to present the song.
 As an
 
example, accompaniment to a field holler is a burden, and I wish
 
to be untrammeled when I sing one.
 My sister, a trained musician,
 
learned,as I did,  "All the Chickens in the Garden" from the
 
oral rendition of our father; however, when she attempted to
 
capture the melody in written notes for use in her guitar class's,
 
she found that she was unable to do so.
 
John Lomax was a strong, honest man.
 None of us who knew him
 
will forget him.
 
PETE SEEGER
 
I really didn't know John Lomax, Jr. very well.
 Oh, I would see
 
him several times a year at the society meetings and maybe one
 
or two other times perhaps at a concert or at the store.  The
 
types of music we were interested in were not really alike.
 His
 
was mostly the southern work song,  cowboy ballad, or blues type
 
13
 
song.
 Mine was the southern mountain song or tear-jerker of
 
the 1890's.
 John expressed himself through the words of the
 
song;  I preferred to do it through the instruments used to
 
play the melody.  I believe John couldn't have cared less about
 
musical instruments, whereas that is my first love.
 So why
 
did I admire and respect the man so much?
 
Sincerity and integrity.
 I believe those two virtures were the
 
things that I admired in John.
 When he sang a song, somehow
 
one felt that that was the way the song should be done.
 He
 
didn't change the beat or accent certain phrases to simply
 
please the crowd or because that's the way it was done on a
 
bestselling record.
 Indeed,  I didn't care for many of his songs
 
at all, but I never doubted the honesty with which they were
 
done.
 His songs were done with a love for the songs and not to
 
try to sell a million records.
 It is something that I think
 
we would all do well to remember.

Even in the mid-1920's, one hesitated to speak of a teenaged
 
boy as a fine person, but John Lomax was the exception.
 In Austin
 
High School, Austin, Texas, John was known not only as a top
 
scholar, but as a young man of integrity and fine character.
 He
 
was admired by the student body and the faculty members alike
 
and was the outstanding favorite during his four year high school
 
career.

Opened a savings account four years ago with John

Within three years, this boy earned and saved $525.00,
 
of which he spent $200.00 to advertise his business.
 
By advertising, his savings after eight months more
 
amounted to a total of $1500.00, now on deposit in
 
the bank.
 
"In what business", do you ask, "could a boy not yet
 
through the High School earn and save $1500.00 in four
 
years?"  John Lomax, Jr., sells The Saturday Evening

Many lost a friend when John Lomax died.
 Many felt his going
 
as deeply as a family loss, so great was his capacity for
 
friendship.
 He had so many virtues that it might have been
 
embarrassing to know him but for the comfortable ease with which
 
he carried them all, so unself-consciously that they had the feel
 
of childlike innocence.
 Virtue in him was not merely dependable,
 
it was inevitable.  We might have taken it for granted except
 
that we were reminded just as inevitably that he was unique:
 
where else find good critical sense with tolerance, strength
 
with tenderness, generosity with acumen, cheerfully salty humor
 
with richly moral values.
 This is more than most of us will
 
leave in our friends' hearts, but John had still another gift.
 
He sang.
 He sang our own songs for us, recreating the accuracy
 
of pitch, the apparent simplicity, the self-effacing absence
 
of histrionics learned first in his family and then from many
 
other singers.
 Man and singer he was the real thing -
-
 a living
 
definition of American folksong.
 
HALLY WOOD
 
I remember John Lomax best in a series of flashbacks,  each one a
 
story in itself:
 
Meeting John for the first time, around 1951,
 at our house
 
when the Weavers came to visit.
 
When John sang our two older kids would burst with fun-
laughing, loving the singing but struck with the strange
 
voice and the fun gestures.
 
We pegged John for an arch conservative when he poked fun,
 
with zest, at FDR in song...
 
Until he, with more zest, sang:  "Last Night I Had the
 
Strangest Dream."
 
Though Margaret said we were putting the cart before the
 
horse, John, Ed Badeaux, Chester Bower, and I started the
 
Houston Folklore Society around 1951-2
 or so, because we
 
wanted to catch and hold onto all the folk things around
 
US.
 
Which led John to say to me:  "You ought to get back into
 
the Folklore Group, you were one of the ORIGINALS".
 
John, a macho on the handball court, urged me to give it
 
a try even after a 20-year layoff.
 
From performances at the Jewish Community Center:
 
John hammering away at a log with an ax to set the mood
 
for a worksong he was belting out.
 
Holding out his hand to show how John Henry's dad held
 
him in the palm of his hand.
 
And up came the gun that laid low the Gray Goose--Bim Bar
n.
 
Ezra Schact trying to persuade John not to use "nigger"
 
even if that was the way it was sung in the original.
 
And a
. booming:
 "
I went down Ellum and turned up Main
 
Looking for the man who sells cocaine"
 
John wearing his sandals, a symbol of his unpretentious
 
individualism.
 
A courageous John saying that he had a rough time with
 
the cancer that hit him but that he would lick it, and
 
he did.
 
Two weeks before he died, John sitting under and talking
 
about a painting of a younger, strapping, swimming John.
 
15
 
Wearing his farmer's straw hat and flannel shirt and
 
sporting a cane to help him walk after he was hit by
 
a car, John looked the picture of health.
 
At his funeral, all of us singing:
 "When my blood
 
runs chilly and cold" brought tears to all of our
 
eyes, including our older daughter who remembered
 
with nostalgia laughing so hard when John sang.
 
John and his songs stay with me strong and deep like the man
 
he was.
 
So long, John, it's been good to know you.
 
HAROLD V
. BELIKOFF
 
I welcome the privilege to-express my feelings of admiration
 
and profound respect for my departed friend and associate, John
 
Lomax.
 
It takes more than a short acquaintance to discover and fully
 
evaluate the finer points of a person's character, and over the
 
years that I knew him, John Lomax never deviated from his prin-
ciples of fairness and sincerity in all things, a determination
 
to accomplish, and a deep concern for the welfare of others.
 
He was a gentle man but forceful, devoted to his family and
 
considerate of all others.
 
MAX L
. ANTHONY
 
My earliest memories of John Lomax, Jr. date back to about
 
1912.  John then was five years old, his sister Shirley seven,
 
and I was nine.  My grandmother Brown's home was in Austin,
 
and nearby lived her daughter, Bess Brown Lomax (Mrs. John
 
Lomax, Sr.).  During my frequent grandparent visits, as much
 
of my time as possible was spent with my cousins Shirley and
 
John.
 Hence, I cherish memories which span a large part of
 
his lifetime.
 Since I had no brother or sister, Shirley and
 
John provided the next best substitute.
 
Compared with today, children's past-time activities were
 
simple.
 Trees were very important.  We climbed them prodigiously,
 
and even fell out of them, sometimes breaking bones.
 I have a
 
vivid memory of John being such a victim, and Shirley and I being
 
held accountable therefor.
 
Children's toys and possessions were sparse but adequate.  A bi-
cycle was about the ultimate.
 Next came a baseball and bat, and
 
maybe a glove.
 I don't recall our being interested in tracking
 
down Indians, but an air rifle was treasured for bird hunting.
 
A homemade sling shot was a must.
 
We children played games alot; marbles, tops, hop-scotch, base-
ball (
strictly no adults involved).
 We collected coupons and
 
baseball hero pictures which came in cigaret packages (
Camel,
 
Chesterfield, and 3 or 4 others completed the field).
 Since
 
"allowances" for children had not then been invented, money was
 
rarely one of our possessions.
 However, every boy always car-
ried in his pockets at least a few marbles and usually one or
 
more tops.
 Such items served as a medium of exchange among
 
the neighborhood children and effectively constituted our
 
wealth.
 Incidentally, such money was sound and not plagued by
 
inflation.
 
John's parents were remarkable, outstanding, and truly unique;
 
virtues which escaped me until some twenty years later.
 His
 
father was professor of English at the University of Texas,
 
and his mother was an equally ardent scholar.  Her cultural
 
interests guided the activities within the Lomax home--it is
 
no wonder that I was so attracted to such an atmosphere.
 Books
 
16
 
filled the Lomax home, and the children thus became avid
 
readers.
 
Reading was not confined to classics.
 A highlight each week
 
came when,  on Sunday morning,  "Uncle John" to me and "Father"
 
to Shirley and John, would take us to the University where he
 
had access to assorted newspapers.
 We children gleaned the
 
"funnies" from his papers, spread ourselves on the floor to
 
pursue our studies at university level.
 The "Katzenjammer
 
Kids" were the most sought "comics" those days; Mutt and Jeff
 
were close contenders.
 Thus began John's literary career.
 
In the Lomax home an upright piano was a prominent tool.
 
Aunt Bess used it effectively.
 I thought she was wonderful;
 
but I doubt now that she took prizes as a classical musician.
 
I was very impressed by another item about the size of an
 
oversize shoe box.
 It was an early portable Edison phonograph
 
which recorded on a wax cylinder and could play back at very
 
low level.
 I recall that Uncle John had used it to "collect"
 
cowboy songs.
 Thus John had the advantage of homegrown music
 
around him ever since he first learned to fall out of trees.
 
Fortunately for me, my contacts with John have been quite
 
frequent through all of his lifetime.
 He was very fond of
 
my father, his "Uncle Allie".
 That mutual fondship likely
 
partially influenced John to settle in Houston when he re-
turned from World War II.
 When my dad retired from railroad-
ing at age 70, he and John embarked in the real estate devel-
oping business in Houston.
 I participated with t
i
m to a
 
small degree.
 This wonderful relationship between John and
 
my father spanned twenty years.
 Certainly it extended my
 
father's life and contributed to his reaching age 91 and
 
enjoying every year of it.
 I am truly grateful to John.
 
HART BROWN
 
Jan. 20, 1975
 
John A. Lomax gave us all the idea that folksingers and folk-
singing were not really all that queer and then gave us a place
 
to ply our avocation among friends.
 For that alone there ought
 
to be a reward in the hereafter.
 
PETE WHEELER
 
"Ain't no more cane on de Brazos
 
It's all been ground into molasses"
 
Big John is gone, but his strong voice lingers in my mind as if
 
it were only yesterday that we walked through Memorial Park
 
along John's "ghost" trail talking about Leadbelly, John's
 
father, Woody Guthrie, and a host of other lively topics.
 John
 
had a kind of wisdom and wit that made his stories come alive
 
with the warmth of an early summer morning breeze and the zest
 
of a glass of Shiner Beer.
 We all will miss John Lomax, miss
 
him when we feel the need of a strong song sung from a deep
 
understanding and love.
 
John and I rode the same trail for about five years.
 It was a
 
good trail, well marked, brushed out and free of troublesome
 
entanglements.
 We collected Folkmusic and Lore together among
 
the Black people of Texas.
 John had a great love for the Black
 
man, he saw him through eyes that were wide open; honest eyes.
 
I remember once when a film crew was in Houston and wanted to
 
talk to John and myself.
 Actually they wanted to talk to John,
 
and John included me in the deal out of generosity and companion-
ship.
 We met with the earnest  young cinematographers, dispelling
 
their fears and giving solid counsel for the project they had in
 
mind.
 John then suggested that we repair to the old second ward
 
area where we could take in a show at Irene's Place that might
 
interest all of us.
 
I noticed a twinkle in John's eye and began to guess what he had
 
in wind.
 We traveled through the bug humming night to the second
 
ward, which at that time was badly in need of road repair and
 
garbage pickup.
 Irene's was heard before it was seen.
 Lightnin'
 
17
 
Hopkins was playing.
 The soft and soulful raging of Lightnin's
 
guitar transported the entire scene back to the early thirties;
 
it was the Blues.
 
We entered Irene's Place and saw im'
diately that we were the
 
only white people in the establishment.  John smiled that great
 
grin of his toward the little raised bandstand and hollered,
 
"Mr. Sam "Lightnin " Hopkins, I brought some friends to hear
 
the world's greatest Blues Man."  Lightnin' was quick to respond,
 
"Mr. John, folks, this is my main man, Mr. John Lomax, and any
 
friend of his is a friend of mine."  The joint returned to a pleas-.
 
ant hilarity, and we sat down at a table with several Black people
 
and proceeded to enjoy the very substantial talents of Sam Hopkins.
 
The evening wound down pleasantly until closing time; as the bar
 
began to empty, we hung on.  John had begun an animated conversa-
tion with one of the patrons on some obscure and totally irrevelent
 
subject.  As soon as this broke off, John and Lightnin' took it up
 
their conversation was in the light banter of old friends, there
 
was no black and white, no rich and poor, no barriers of any kind.
 
John asked politely after Lightnin's woman, and Lightnin' asked
 
about Margaret.
 Clearly they were pleased to be in each other's
 
company.
 
After listening for a moment, I noted a subtle change in Sam's
 
demeanor.
 "You think you're a good enough hand at pool to take
 
on a poor nigger?" Sam asked, playing to John with the broadest
 
of pathic comedy.  John didn't blink an eye.
 "Lightnin', that
 
day has come when this old boy is going to clean your clock!"
 
And then began the greatest game of pool it has ever been my
 
fortune to observe.
 John would attempt and make shots that
 
would have driven masters of the game to tears, only to be
 
topped by Sam Hopkins in a kind of immitation drunken grace
 
and stumbling charm that was completely disarming.  All the while
 
the two men played the "Dozens" on each other with a mock ferocity
 
that terrified the handful of movie men watching the game.
 As
 
the match neared its completion the two men began to chuckle and
 
snort a little.  When Lightnin' made a final shot that brought
 
the game to an end, John roared with laughter.
 "Old Lightnin'
 
and me shore had you guessing that time!" was John's closing
 
remark made through the gales of happy sounds that were eminating
 
from our film crew members.  John Lomax had effectively demon-
strated his own humanity and the humanity of people of every
 
color, in a short fun-filled pool game in a dive in Houston's
 
second ward.
 
I remember another walk on John's "Ghost Trail", in fact, it was
 
our first jaunt over this rough bit of real estate in Houston's
 
Memorial Park.  With us were my wife, our children, and Mike
 
Ledbetter, editor of the English publication "Blues Unlimited",
 
who was in the States researching the lives and work of Blues artists
 
The day was a ht one, one of those South Texas summer scorchers
 
when the heat and the humidity were rivaling each other for the
 
unpleasant honor of being the highest.  This did not bother john
 
who loped through the brush and brambles like a billy goat.
 
Mike was doing his best to keep up, and I was huffing and puffing,
 
being about fifty pounds heavier than at present.  John was com-
menting on the unusually large number of "mully-huggers" that were
 
said to inhabit the woods.
 My children immediately corrupted this
 
into "mother huggers" and were just a bit fearful why any beast
 
of the forest would want to hug their mother,who was the self-
proclaimed champion of all animals.
 Still John stalked on, talk-
ing of the days when Johnny and Joe were in Scouting, and he was
 
a Scout leader.
 
Suddenly an armadillo burst from its place of hiding and made a
 
breakaway from the strung-out group.  This was just the excitement
 
John was waiting for.
 He leaped in hot pursuit, "A Mully-hugger."
 
he proclaimed in his easy drawl and crashed through the under-
growth.
 '
A Mother-hugger!" cried my kids and charged after John
 
with the exurberance of 6 and 7 year olds, followed by their

then chubby father yelling,  "
It's an armadillo, careful, they
 
can scratch like hell!"  And finally by Mike Ledbetter wondering
 
outloud,  "What the bloody hell has gotten into you yanks?"  We
 
all ran the poor "Hoover Hog" around bushes and trees, up mud banks
 
and down creek draws, always with John's 60-year-old body in firm
 
and graceful lead.
 We ended our chase along the banks of the
 
Bayou.
 Talking of animals and incidents out of the past, a warm
 
feeling of closeness and pleasant exhaustion permeated us all.
 
I also remember the evening that John came to our house with a
 
large sack in his arms.
 He had bicycled over from his house.
 
After the briefest of conversation, John announced that he had
 
come to visit our children, not us, so thank you, man, where
 
were they?
 
The four Skoog children had gone to bed already, but a visit
 
from John Lomax was an important event, and we, or rather John,
 
roused them out of their beds and trooped them upstairs to our
 
attic room, leaving the sack with us.
 John's instructions were
 
simple,  "Put this in the refrigerator and bring it when I say."
 
Joan and I quickly did his bidding.
 
The sounds that proceeded to come from the upstairs kept us
 
chuckling and singing along .
for about an hour.
 Then a deep
 
voice sent out a cry from upstairs,  "Okay, we're ready for
 
our ice cream, and be quick about it!"  We quickly complied
 
filling bowls with rich,  smooth ice cream and joining the
 
play-party upstairs.
 
The evening ended with smiles all around and a kind of happy
 
grace that lasted far, far longer than the evening.
 John
 
Lomax had performed in front of the audience he loved best.

There exists in the garden behind the Lomax family home on
 
anderbilt Street a large octagonal patio, fashioned of pre-
cision-cut natural Texas stone, a fine relic of the stone
 
business John Lomax started when he and Mimi first moved
 
to Houston in the L0's.
 I have discovered that most every-
thing John Avery Lomax, Jr.  did was as solid and as endurable
 
as that natural Texas stone.. . including the indelible impres-
sion he left on me.
 
I met John in September,  1973,
 having become friends with his
 
son Joe, and soon learned that he had had a stroke which af-
fected mostly his ability to remember from day to day even the
 
simplest of events.
 That John was even alive was testimony to
 
his rock-like strength, for he had died no less than eight
 
times when the stroke occurred.
 In the beginning I questioned
 
John on how he felt and when he replied that he was awfully
 
miserable because he couldn't remember things too well, I
 
decided Joe and I would take John with us on our many outings
 
and perhaps through sheer enjoyment of the activities, make
 
him forget his forgetfulness.
 
Our first trip was one of many Sunday crabbing expeditions.
 
There were Joe and John and I, Lynda Herrera, Frank Davis,
 
Danny Schact, and Bob Novotny, all piled into Bob's pickup
 
truck with crab nets, bait, potato salad, sandwiches, and
 
beer.
 Although the weather was inclement and we caught no
 
crabs, John Lomax saved the day with his storytelling and
 
singing.
 We returned that evening tired and hoarse from
 
singing all the way back to Houston, but we were very happy.
 
The most notable of our excursions was a trip to the Big Bend
 
of Texas in late February of  '
7L,
 where we fashioned a raft out
 
of truck innertubes, wooden poles, and lashing and entering the
 
Rio Grande River, the international boundary between Texas and
 
Mexico, from the camp sight of Talley, rafted into Mariscal
 
Canyon where we stopped and camped for several days.

One of the greatest times I remember was when Hally Wood came
 
through Houston on her way to Denver.
 She has been a friend
 
of the Lomax family and musically associated with them for
 
years.
 Joe planned a file gumbo party and sing-in for the
 
benefit of John,and many people from the folklore society
 
came to the Lomax home for a day of singing and gaiety, the
 
likes of which I've never seen.
 It so happened that Sonny
 
Terry and Brownie McGee were in town that weekend, and it
 
proved to be a memorable meeting of old and respected friends
 
for John.

John Lomax was a tower of strength to the end, and it was the
 
result of an accident that brought him back to Houston to re-
cuperate.
 While in the state of Maine in late October, 1974,
 
John was hit by a truck while standing on a street corner.
 
He was thrown 40 feet and sustained only minor injuries, and
 
not a
. scratch could be found on him.
 He returned to Houston
 
in November and in the ensuing month before his death he was
 
able to visit with almost all of his friends including Mance
 
Lipscomb and many members of the Houston Folklore Society.
 
He was in his home on Vanderbilt when he died a very quick
 
and private death. 
I shall miss him.
 
The following was originally written as an article for the
 
Houston Folklore Society publication in May, 1967.
 We are
 
reprinting it here for the "behind-the-scenes" picture of
 
the birth of the first album in which John A. Lomax, Jr.
 
appeared.
 John subsequently participated in "Unexpurgated
 
Songs for Men" collected by Mack McCormick and also made a
 
solo album "John A. Lomax, Jr. Sings" for Folkways.
 
back a 
o
fl od of fond memories.
 The album itself, the arrange-
20
 
ments,  polishing and rehearsing, and actual recording covered a
 
period of about five months.
 After it was completed, we went
 
on for a couple of years singing the material on television
 
(
Channel ii) and at hootenannies.
 Of the record itself, I have
 
mixed feelings.
 It was a challenge and fun to make, but any
 
recording is but a shadow of what went into it.
 More important
 
to me were our other efforts, beginning with the founding of
 
the Houston Folklore Group in 1952,
 and running through the
 
course of the fifties and sixties with countless hootenannies,
 
parties, radio programs, and other lively attempts to enlighten
 
the happy, sleeping angel that is Houston as to the things that
 
are really worthwhile and important in this life of ours.
 These
 
attempts, I must admit,  in spite of our near Herculean efforts,
 
aroused only the most gentle of breezes, barely tickling the
 
fine down which grows on the sleeping angel's shoulderblades.
 
But to get back to the album, it, and for that matter the
 
hootenannies, were neither art nor scholarship.  We loved,
 
and still love, the songs and were interested in keeping
 
their spirit alive and growing.
 We began the project for
 
Audio/Fidelity records.
 They wanted an album of Te as songs
 
to sell the many expatriate and would-be Texans who abound in
 
the nation as a whole.
 Of course, they had in mind songs like
 
"Deep in the Heart of Texas" and "When It's Roundup Time in
 
Texas" and "The Bloom is on the Sage."  They knew nothing, and
 
cared less, for the many wonderful folksongs Texas has spawned.
 
They had originally gotten in touch with Alan Lomax through
 
Oscar Brand, who had sung many of his cleaned-up dirty songs
 
for A/F.
 Alan wasn't interested and sent them to brother John.
 
John had me visit them and work out the details as I passed
 
thro' gh New York, returning from camp in Vermont.
 I got an
 
advance of two-hundred from A/F to get things rolling, and I
 
got together the cream of the folk musicians around Houston
 
at that time: John, Howie Porper, Pete Rose, Jim McConnell,
 
and Ed Pyett.
 We decided to make the album half folk and half
 
popular, selected our songs, and began working out arrange-
ments.
 We began in September, and A/F was planning to come
 
down to Houston the first week in November to record.
 As per
 
their request I sent them up a tape of our progress in the
 
middle of October to let Them see how they were coming.
 '
Twas
 
rather bad, I'm afraid.
 Not being working professionals, we
 
weren't really that polished after five weeks of rehearsals,
 
two a week.
 Also our hearts were in only half the material,
 
and A/F was really only interested in the other half.
 A
 
hasty phone call from New York followed by seconds the arrival
 
of the tape there, and the project was cancelled.
 
The Tex-I-An Boys held a strategy meeting and decided to hell
 
with commercial recording companies; we would throw out most of
 
the commercial songs and replace them with real Texas folksongs
 
and try to get the album issued by Folkways.
 We cut down our
 
practice sessions to one per week, arranged to have the material
 
taped at the U of H FM station, and got down to work.  We kept
 
several of the popular songs ("San Antonio Rose",  "T for Texas",
 
"Remember the Alamo") because we felt that they reflected an
 
authentic feeling of a side of Texas life.
 But to "The Chisholm
 
Trail",  "The Boll Weevil Song", and "Streets of Laredo" we added
 
other lesser known Texas songs like "Cowboy's Dream",  "The
 
Galveston Flood", and "Long Summer Day".
 The songs themselves
 
were recorded on three successive Saturday mornings in late
 
December and January in 1961-62.  Ed Pyett had begun to lose
 
interest during December and had dropped out before the record-
ing began, and so our number had decreased to five.
 Pete Rose
 
played mostly mandolin, though he accompanied John Lomax on
 
"Ain't No More Cane on the Brazos" on guitar.
 Jim McConnell
 
played guitar on virtually all the group numbers, and I played
 
5-string banjo or autoharp on group numbers.
 On "T for Texas"
 
we had three guitars going; Pete playing a good, steady rhythm,
 
Jim improvising in the lower part of the keyboard, and I
 
improvising at the top of the neck.
 
I edited the album during the spring of  '62 and got Mack
 
21
 
1cCormick to write the notes.
 The record was issued the next
 
year, and though it was never a bestseller by any stretch of
 
the imagination, it did sell above the average Folkways album.
 
We used the album as the basis of the first Hootenanny we did
 
at Cullen Auditorium in the spring of 1963, and our group was
 
to perform together from then on.
 
Three of the Tex-I-An Boys, Pete, Jim, and I
, did a second
 
album, mostly bluegrass, for Folkways, but unfortunately
 
this album was never released.  This was unfortunate because
 
in many ways this album was better than the other one.
 For
 
one thing, we were much more experienced in playing together
 
when we recorded it in the late spring of 1964.  And also
 
the equipment used to record it was better, Ampex tape
 
recorders and a Telefunken microphone.
 Perhaps this will
 
someday be issued, but since bluegrass is now very pro-
fessionalized, this seems unlikely.
 
Perhaps the most significant thing about both the albums and
 
the many programs which we have given around Houston is this
 
attitude of ours about professionalism.  We naturally began
 
to acquire a certain amount of professional gloss after our
 
years of performing together.
 But we not only didn't try to
 
develop this, we consciously fought against it.
 For basic
 
in our philosophy is the feeling that folkmusic is an amateur
 
music, a music for recreation and a music to stir and touch
 
basic emotions.
 For this reason we fought against becoming
 
glib and slick.  Ed Pyett had musically juiced up quite a few
 
of our arrangements in early Tex-I-An Boy days, but when he
 
drQpped out, we returned to more basic chords for accompani-
ment.
 For the record we knew more chords than we played,
 
but though we would play a fancy chord when it seemed to be
 
called for, we tried to be very conscious of the fact that
 
the accompaniment should supplement, not supplant, the song.
 
But perhaps the most unique thing about the album, and all of
 
our activities at that time, was that five individualists such
 
as we are, could ever have gotten together and blended our
 
mutual efforts in the first place.
 Politically we were divided,
 
and many a rehearsal was ended in rousing argument.  These
 
arguments were mild, though, in the days of the album, but
 
were to bloom to epic proportions during the two Cullen Hoot-
enannies which were to follow.
 Yet, through it all, I believe
 
that we had a genuine feeling and respect for one another in
 
regards to individual abilities, and this was the key to
 
whatever success our endeavors enjoyed.  This feeling is still
 
present today, at least on my part, and I suspect with the
 
others, and were the occasion to arise, I for one would welcome
 
nothing more than to he able to resume the activities of the
 
Tex-I-An Boys.
 I miss the arguments, the crisises, the stormy
 
rehearsals, the excitement of working out arrangements and
 
putting together the programs, and most of all I miss the music.
 
It is not often in this world that you are able to really put a
 
great deal of yourself into an activity you love; and though
 
the material rewards from our efforts were always slight, the
 
spiritual rewards were very, very rich.
 It was a warm, fine
 
experience.
 The Tex-I-An Boys' album, the only tangible result
 
of our efforts, is a very pale record of it, at best.
 
We have heard about John Lomax's death.
 It is sad to see the
 
passing of an era.

Probably more boys have been connected with sales of the Saturday
 
Evening Post than any other publication.
 The advertisement above
 
speaks of one boy's enterprise as an inducement to others to join
 
their sales force, and is not concerned with the particular boy
 
except that he made a far better example for their purposes than
 
the average.
 
Taking the money to the bank to open his account posed a minor
 
logistics problem as this large sum was entirely in silver dollars.
 
Walking was considered, but why walk when you can ride, and John
 
owned a horse -
-
 well, half a horse.
 It was a real horse too and
 
and not a mule.
 Sister Shirley owned the other half.
 
They set out with Shirley "at the controls", John sitting behind
 
her, his shirt bloused out with the silver.
 This was the appro-
priate order too, for ownership was not just a matter of holding
 
an equal number of shares of stock or some other abstract, but
 
sensibly physical.
 Shirley, due to seniority, got the front
 
half.
 Each owner was fully responsible for his or her part of
 
the property and, on this day, there was no problem in getting
 
the horse polished up as befitted the occasion.
 
This whole affair was viewed with some apprehension by the family.
 
Suppose the horse were to rear or bolt?  Suppose a seam should
 
split on John's shirt or someone rob them?  All went well though
 
and the money was safely banked.

John was on his way home by train and his coach was all but empty.
 
There was one pretty girl looking out of the window and, as there
 
was a choice of seats, he chose one near her.
 They got to talking
 
and it turned out that she too was from Texas although now living
 
in New York where she worked for the Servel Company.
 At that time,
 
the Servel Company was a French firm which manufactured gas appli-
ances of excellent quality.
 Although it was not her title, she
 
was pretty much in charge of their advertising.
 Very creative,
 
she wrote copy for their ads and had a hand in selecting where
 
they would appear and, of course, followed up the never-ending
 
loose ends involved in production of an ad.
 All of the company
 
executives were French and even she had a rather French-sounding
 
name.
 
John told her he was a Bank Examiner, which didn't make much of an
 
impression and remarked that he was on his way home to Austin.
 Her
 
response was that her only positive view of that place was that her
 
father always said that there was only one man at the University of
 
Texas worth his salt, John Avery Lomax.
 Her attitude suggested that
 
this young man had probably never even heard of such a person.
 
John drew himself up proudly and said,  "My name i
s John Avery
 
Lomax, Jr.".
 
The young lady's name was Margaret Marable, called Mimi by her
 
family and friends.
 She eventually became Mrs. John Avery Lomax,
 
Jr.

Review of t
he Yonth
 
Instead of a book r
eview t
his month we t
hought i
t would be i
nteresting to review
 
t
he life of o
ur o
wn John A
. Lomax, Jr.  -  We would e
specially like for our n
ew members
 
t
o g
et to know him -
i
nd t
o k
now what he n
n  his f
amily have done t
o perserve t
he folk
 
music of our country.
 
The Life and Times of John A. Lomax, Jr.
 
Before and after War I -
 I had a happy boyhood in Austin.  My f
amily loved t
he charm
 
o
f t
hat community in t
hose d
ays; actually, we lived i
n Chicago f
or about 2 years and
 
e
specially t
he 4 children were happy that my father had t
he chance to return to Austin
 
i
n 1919.  I
 went t
hrough i
t's public s
chools and g
raduated f
rom the University of Texas
 
i
n 1928. In t
hose d
ays T
 was n
ot especially interested i
n folk s
ongs  (
which later became
 
my m
ain hobby).  Unconsciously, though, I began to learn and appreciate ballads from
 
t
he s
inging of my parents and f
rom dinner t
able conversations between t
hem and with guests,
 
s
cholars like Dr. Stith Thompson of Indiana University, Dr. George Lyman Kittredge of
 
Harvard and Carl Sandburg.  I appreciated quickly what folk s
ong knowledge and reputation
 
could mean when my Father took me with him on his first lecture tour to western colleges
 
i
n t
he Summer of 1920.
 This was i
ry f
irst trip West and a great adventure.  Py unueual
 
coincidence many years later i
n 1960 I performed for t
he first time in the West at the
 
University of California at the same age that my father had been on his first lecture
 
trip that way.
 
After a year i
n t
he Harvard Business School, I embarked in business life with
 
investment and banking jobs.  The latter came t
o a dramatic end with the failure of my
 
employer b
ank i
n Corpus Christi in 1931.  Most of the following year was most i
nteresting,
 
for I assisted my f
ather during his 25,000 mile folk s
ong lecture tour of the entire U.S.A.
 
The driving and upkeep of t
he faithful '
29 Model A Ford fell to my lot, the correspondence,
 
most of the c
amping out chores, plus the s
ale of f
ather's books after t
he lectures, f
ees
 
f
or which were m
ighty skimpy that deep repression year.  Witi his vital help in t
hat
 
Summer I
 was able to l
and a j
ob as auditor for the Reconstruction Finance Corporation  i
n
 
Washington.  In t
hat capacity for 7 -
 years I traveled the country f
rom coast t
o coast,
 
much to t
he pleasure of a f
ancy f
ree bachelor.  By 1939 my decision not only to get out
 
of the g
overnment s
ervice but t
o get back to Texas led me to Houston as the best s
pot to
 
s
ettle f
or opportunity.  In those  days the town was hard to crack, and I ended up
 
s
crounging up my s
mall capital to buy a f
lag s
tone business early i
n 1941 for a toe hold.
 
The b
ig milestone of that year was my courtship and marriage on May 10th of t
he lovely
 
Margaret Marable.  She was my faithful ever-loving c
amp-follower during my 3 -
 years of
 
Navy s
ervice in War I
I.
 
In 1
946 my maternal uncle, J.A. Brown, a high claseman, provided t
he opportunity to
 
learn the business of l
and and development i
nvestment here.  Our successful partnership
 
continued f
or many years.  Some 10 years ago in his declining years I g
radually began to
 
participate in home building ventures in a close association with !
'arl M. Gilbert,
 
continuing to t
he present.  We h
ave built more than 1
,000 homes in this ever-bourgeoning
 
community, retaining o
wnership of a considerable number of them f
or rental income along
 
with s
everal s
mall business centers we've erected on our land.
 
Secondary hobbies have played parts in my life.  I
 was a s
omewhat controverial
 
Boy Scoutmaster for 3  years but have kept a hand in Scout work for the past 17 years
 
as a troop committeeman, Patrol Advisor and Merit Badge Counsellor
  In my younger
 
years I attained proficiency in a
 number of sports, but Handball had emerged as a lasting
 
g
ame suitable for me.  Above the thrill of winning championships and many t
rophies, I
 
recommend this active masculine sport for conditioning, companionship, fun and for its
 
therapeutic v
alue of relaxation in these fast days of s
tress.  I have lived life over
 
with my s
ons -
 John (
24)  and Joe (
19)  and they have provided me much joy.
 
The Houston Folk Lore  Group', as originally named, was formed in May 1951 by
 
Harold Belikoff, Howie Porper, John A. Lomax, Jr. of Houston, !d Badeaux  (
now of
 
New York City), and Chester Bo
wer (
now in Minneapolis).  The founders had just become
 
acquainted during the s
essions o'  Miss Sarah Gertrude Knott's National Folk Festival
 
held in the Coliseum.  Shortly afterwards, the Group began to meet regularly at the
 
Jewish Community Center and thrived from the s
tart.  The early members were the founders,
 
wives, f
riends and g
eneral members of the Center who became interested.  As has been
 
the c
ase ever s
ince, t
he music would flow at these early meetings, and the word of
 
mouth advertising of the pleased audiences would bring in new members.  Through the
 
years I estimate that our total membership has exceeded 5
,000.  Porper, Badeaux and
 
Lomax c
arried t
he load of performance at the e
arly meetings, often on a formal program
 
basis.  Pete Seeger, here with the Weavers for a month at the Shamrock, g

Thank You Kingston Trio
 
During my childhood I learned many of our t
raditional American folk s
ongs in
 
our public s
chools.  I s
ang s
uch old favorites as  'Sweet Betsy f
rom Pike', and
 
"The Frie Canal", but I was not truly a lover of folk music.  Then in 1958 a trio
 
of young s
ingers c
ame t
o t
he University I was attending and sang many o
f these old
 
s
ongs in a unique s
tyle which I found to be both exciting and dynamic.  These boys
 
were remarkable s
howmen, and they literally captivated our audience of 20,000 e
nthusiastic
 
fans.  I promptly became a disciple of t
hese young men who called their group The Kingston
 
Trio.  I bought a guitar and a banjo and s
oon j
oined a t
rio which copied the s
tyle of
 
the Kingston Trio.  We played and s
ang together and s
pent many happy hours entertaining
 
at clubs, s
chools, b
anquets, parties, etc.
 
By 1959 t
he Kingston Trio was almost a household name, and t
heir record album s
ales
 
were f
antastic.  Their s
uccess encouraged the b?ginnlng of many other f
ine f
olk g
roups,
 
but the Kingston Trio was truly t
he King.
 
As the p
opularity of t
he Kingston Trio g
row a movement of resistance grew within
 
the r
anks of t
raditional folklorist who oppose this new s
tyle of s
inging t
raditional
 
fo11 usic.  The anti-Kingston f
eeling reached a p
eak during the e
arly 1960'e, and it
 
became almost blasphemy t
o s
peak their name or  s
ing t
heir s
ongs i
n the presence of s
ome
 
folk puritists.
 
Now the Kingston Trio i
s no more, but there i
s s
till much debate as t
o wheather o
r
 
not the effects i
t had on folk music were good o
r bad.  I for one feel that they added
 
a new dimension to f
olk music which awakened o
ur nations interest in t
he music of its
 
past and its present.  True t
he tide of public interest in folk music has receded.  Put
 
in the wake of t
he 'Kingston t
ide" which s
wept our nation t
here are many such as I who
 
not only retain our l
ove for their music but also have a new appreciation of all folk
 
music.  Before t
he rise of the Kingston Trio most of the folk music I had '
eard was
 
s
ung by g
ood p
eople, but r
ather poor musicians.  Much of t
his has not changed, but I
 
have.  I s
till p
refer t
he bcautr and blend of the voices of Peter, Paul, and Mary o
r
 
the r
ing of Pete Seeger's banjo t
o t
hose such as myself with f
ewer t
alents.  However,
 
I c
an now more fully aprreclate the beauty of folk music whether s
ung by professional
 
talents o
r by amateurs,  Fcr t
his new revelation I t
h.nk the Kingston Trio.
