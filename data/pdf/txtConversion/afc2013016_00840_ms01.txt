Interview introduction 
Lucy Long Memorial Day 
Interviewing Nailam Elkhechen (Lebanese woman living in Toledo for almost 20 years; She is 
completing a 
Masters in nutrition.) 
Thursday May 22nd 
She has been helping Lucy with this prcject and introducing her to Middle Eastern stores in the 
area as well as Detroit. Will be interviewing her as a 
customer of ethnic stores and about her 
family members that work in different ethnic grocery stores. 
00:01:58 
Shopping at ethnic stores vs regular ones. 
Do you do most of your shopping in the ethnic stores? 
Half but not most. Because of convenience. The Middle Eastern store is farther away. She may 
ask her sister to pick something up but sometimes she is too busy. If Kroger's has it she will get 
it there. Like to do more shopping at the ethnic store but doesn't because of time and 
convenience. 
Price is a 
consideration at timesparticularly for vegetables. 
Example--Parsley is cheaper and seems to be more fresh and larger than at a 
regular grocery 
store. Lemons are also cheaper and better. 
She buys arugula at a 
regular one because she doesn't see it at an ethnic grocery. 
00:03:50 
Comparison of produce at ethnic and regular stores. 
Do they have varieties of vegetable as the ethnic sores that are not available at a 
regular grocery 
store? 
Yes. We Use plain parsley, which you don't always see and they sell it in small quantities like 
for garnishing but she prefers to buy large amounts because they use it for eating. 
Fava beans, cucumbers, some fruits and vegetables-- figs green plums green almonds, small 
eggplants--can't be found in regular grocery store. And the prices are reasonable. 
Going from one grocery store to another other isn't easy; it's more convenient to buy everything 
at one store it's so much easier. 
00:06:11 
The social aspects of shopping at ethnic stores. 
When you are at a 
regular American store you are just a 
customer, a 
person, or number. But at 
an ethnic store I 
know everyone and they greet you, they ask about your family travel. You get 
individual attention. You get to see people you don't always see. You learn more about your 
community and members of your community by talking with the people. 
00:08:28 
Grocery stores as communities. Emotional impact of stores. 
It's a 
way to find community 
If traveling to a 
different city would you make appoint to go to a 
Middle Eastern grocery store? 
Yes. You go to look for foods there that may not be available at the local ethnic grocery. 
Do you think there is an emotional or psychological motivation to go to an ethnic grocery store? 
It's a 
different environment. People say when we go to Dearborn, MI. we feel like we are in 
Beirut. "When we miss Lebanon we go there. Because you feel like everyone around you ... is a 
member of your community... you can relate to people more because they are of the same 
background." 
"You don't feel isolated or alone." The images in the stores and the music reminds you of place 
in your past or wedding you had been to (via the music). 
00:11:44 
Money displays in stores. [Wall displays with money and coins are common in the 
groceries.] 
They collect money from different places, reminds of place you have been. 
Does the display of particular currencies cause political red flags among people? No. Usually 
people don't do that when they come here. They leave those behind. They try to assimilate into 
the American culture. Focus on business and making better life for themselves and families. 
May talk about politics during social gatherings but not bring it into their business. 
00:16:38 
Food as symbol of politics. 
Are there any names of food or foods that symbolize a 
political issue? 
No. Can't think of anything 
00:18:50 
Regional names of foods. 
There are different names for foods in different regions. Do you ever find that issue happening 
in the ethnic stores? No, they use the generic foods/names. i.e., Tabouli is a 
commonly used 
name. The confusion may happen with the dishes themselves. Some may be more involved 
foods to prepare or not attractive to the masses. Some foods are hard to sell because they are 
given slang names so there is no way to translate it. Asula = dandelion leaves for example. 
00:24:31 
Adaptations in the U.S. 
Do you see any changes for American customers? Like in the menus? 
Do the stereotypical foods become the home foods and the home foods die out? 
It can happen. If she doesn't cook the stuff at home her kids will never see it then it will become 
lost. 
It does seem to happen if it's a 
food that takes time. With both men and women working, it does 
happen especially if the women don't have the passion to cook it. 
00:27:18 
American awareness of Middle Eastern food. 
Have you seen a 
change in what Americans know of Middle Eastern food? 
I 
think so--because of all the media sources. 
00:29:50 
Pride in her food, and shame. Educating other people about it. 
Do have a 
sense of pride when seeing hummus promoted? Yes. 
Tell story of packing her son's lunch: He felt awkward because he had different food then the 
other kids. They would always ask him what he had. She talked to the teacher and spoke to the 
class about the health benefits and took food into the class to share. 
This is no longer a 
problem. Hummus can be found in many schools as well as some other 
Middle Eastern foods. 
00:32:15 
Stores and economic opportunity. Good work ethic more important than ethnic 
affiliation. 
Part of becoming an American is becoming financially established. These grocery stores are 
helping with that. It's easier for them to work in them because of the language. 
Do the owners feel it is part of their role in the community? No, they feel like they are just 
hardworking trust worthy people. 
Not all people are hard workers or fit for these jobs. She tells a 
story of how sister in laws son 
worked at the place she did (the mother) and the son ended up stop working there because he 
didn't fit in with the other employees. The parents didn't take offence at their employer because 
they knew it was their son being the problematic one. 
Sharing ethnicity means they know how to talk to each other and what to say without being 
offensive. They also understand expectations.

00:01:04 
Store owner and hospitality towards employees. 
Story about the guy at the middle Eastern Market. He wanted everyone to his wedding so he had 
to close the market early so him employees could make it. 
He did invite some customers. 
00:01:06 
Competition among stores and different tastes within ethnic groups. 
The foundation of capitalist system is competition. 
Dos that happen with the Middle Eastern 
stores? Are there loyalties expected? 
With some maybe. Some have different customer base. 
She personally looks for a 
welcoming environment. That's why she likes to go to them. Is 
Ethnic loyalty a 
factor? Yes there is, but there are also different sects of Muslims. Also their 
tastes are different. One market may have foods that taste a 
little different than others. 
00:03:30 
Dividing business between stores to keep unity in community. 
There is a 
balance between business and being part of an ethnic community. 
Example: the Mosque would order food during Ramadan, and they would always order from the 
Middle Eastern market. Another market complained about why they didn't order from them. So 
the Mosque began ordering from the other market every other time. 
00:06:30 
Fortunate to have so many stores in Toledo. 
So lucky in Toledo. We used to have to go to Dearborn to get food and now we have places to 
choose from in Toledo. 
00:06:40 
Differences between small ethnic groceries and new big international supermarkets. 
Did you feel a 
different from the large supermarket (the one in Dearborn, MI) compared to the 
smaller ones (ethnic grocery stores)? Yes, it felt more American. 
Do you think they (the big ones) have the same sense of community? No. Things on a 
smaller 
scale means that you can build a 
relationship.
