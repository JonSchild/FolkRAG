Dear Bess:
 
Got the edited interview today. Not only were your
 
edits helpful in terms of my punctuation and spelling,
 
but I agreed with you about everything else.  I can't
 
thank you enough for all this,  and I hope it wasn't a
 
bother.
 
I' ve enclosed a Xerox of your marked and edited
 
version with my initials,  as well as the check marks I
 
made as I instigated each edit.  I've enclosed,  as well,
 
a final copy with all the edits affected.
 
I added a "however"  in one place,  in the
 
Leadbelly section so there would be a smoother
 
transition  (P.5)  (". . .That's one of the reasons he was
 
able to stay alive in the pen,  I suspect.  Because his
 
music was rural,  however,  he couldn't play in the
 
uptown places....") .
 If that's not okay,  let me know.
 
Everything else is as you requested.  I don't think I
 
over looked anything.
 
My kindest regards,
 
I hope all is well with you,
 
P.S.  8/2/97--I apologize for being so late
 
with this reply,  as evidenced by the date
 
above,  when I began it. My house has been
 
under repair and this process has been
 
disconcerting,  along with everything else in
 
life.

Erik:
 
In and around Washington Square arguments would
 
ensue now and again about what is a folk song?
 
From a musicalogical point of view, what would you
 
say a folk song is?
 
Bess Lomax Hawes:
 
Well, you've got to distinguish between a folk song
 
and the performance. The song is the thing,  and
 
then the singer or the performer is the artist.  I
 
happen to feel that when Marion Anderson sang an
 
African American spiritual,  it was a totally
 
different thing than when Vera Hall sang it. When
 
Marion Anderson sang it,  it was a beautiful song,
 
but it had been taken completely out of its
 
original style and moved into the concert style.
 
And so,  to me,  it's not any more the same thing.
 
The song can be picked up,  the tune replicated,  and
 
the words replicated, but w
1en you hear someone
 o f
 
a truly different artistic ah  c
tural experience
 
attempt to sing it,  a part of it s essence is
 
completely changed. You can say of a song that it
 
has moved in and out of different areas. A folk
 
melody can have been used by Beethoven in one of
 
his symphonies,  and then it went back into the
 
common language and was sung throughout Austria in
 
rural areas,  and then,  later,  it got changed into
 
thus and so.  It becomes a different thing,
 
depending on how and where it's used.
 
A folk song performance, however,  isn't au th en ti c 
at all,  in terms\of its being a part of its roots,
 
if the song isn'l\ done by the people who or ig ina ll y 
produced it. Buty\authenticity\
per se,  isn't the
 
only
 e
J? A good example  7
is Maxine
 llivan
 
who bopped up
 _ lot of children's g
e
 
songs. And I think she was superb. She ha
 
beautiful voice,  and she did those songs
 
exquisitely.  She made them into somet ing quite
 
different than they origina lly were, hè ever. And
 
-
 They
 
weren't authentic children's game
\songs  they were

 jazz  tun
 F   me,
 
though,  over time , the most
 moving k rf rmances
 
have always been by the people who
ori

cultural property the music was. There's another

qualifier there, however. Those
 ginal peopl\
 
were not,  all of them,  always 1
-'art people
 \
,
 
within their own tradition. There's only one
 
Leadbelly, and there were a lot of black convicts
 
who sang their indigenous music. Leadbelly happened
 
to be one of the unique ones. For me, his
 
performances came across almost always as being the
 
finest of whatever it was he was singing.  It's a
 
combination of having a superb artist, who is also
 
doing the music of his own culture,  the stuff from
 
the culture he was raised in.
 
People tend to feel there's only one kind of thing
 
that's any good,  and I don't think that's true.  I
 
think there are lots of things that are any good.
 
They vary,  sometimes,  in their degree of goodness.
 
I use to go with father on some of his collecting
 
trips, and, boy,  it was a bore,  sometimes. As Alan
 
says,  "One of the reasons I started thinking about
 
style was that I had to have something to think
 
about as I was listening to the nine-thousandth
 
version of  'Barbary Allen' that I recorded in my
 
life."
 
What was your experience of folk music in
 
1940,  1941?
 
Bess Lomax Hawes:
 
I
'm a complicated case because my father  (John
 
Lomax), as you probably remember, was a folklorist.
 
My father and brother were great field men. My
 
brother still is. They had done an enormous amount
 
of recording in the field. Those two guys, plus
 
fifteen or twenty other major collectors of the
 
twenties,  thirties,  and forties had collected a lot
 
of material. The earliest published big collection
 
was Carl Sandberg's. But a lot of people had been
 
working in different sections of the country.
 
Father and my brother, Alan,  specialized mostly in
 
the Southwest and South, primarily in the South.
 
Other people,  as well,  in other places had done an
 
extensive job in collecting and making available
 
music in recorded form. For the first time,  not
 
just in books, you could hear the voices of the

sing
 
ç
s
 and how extraordinary their
,"
 music really
 
was. Th S gorgeous stuff was just 14ng around in
 
archives X
in the Library of Congress
and available
 
to people. I had participated with fat er and Alan
 
in some of their work.
 During vacations, while I
 
was in college,  I helped out on research projects,
 
worked with the Library of Congress,  and I
'd been
 
with father on a couple of recording sessions.  I
 
had talked with my brother, Alan,  a lot, and had
 
studied transcribing music with Ruth Seeger,
 
briefly. She lived in Washington,  also,  at the
 
time.  So,  in a sense,  I was sort of dropped into \it
 
all as a kid.
 
The United States, as my brother put it, w
 the
 
end-point of most of the major human migrations,
 
starting with the American Indians--probably coming
 
over the land bridges from Asia;  then there were
 
the European migrations; and the Africans were
 
brought here. They didn't want to come, b
tt they
 
wound up here in large num bers.

e -# ese art forms mingled in this
 
country,  they went into creative explosions of o
fe
 
kind or another,  so that there was a tremendous
 
amount of inventiveness. At that time,  father and
 
Alan were picking up on indigenous music th
- t--
being created here that had never been heard
 
anywhere else before. Chain gang songs or the black
 
work songs never had happened like this. Not to say
 
that work songs didn't exist, but those particular
 
kinds of songs were not part of the African
 
continental experience,  they were Afro-American.
 
Blues,  jazz, hillbilly, all of it boiling up here
 
as fast as it could boil.
 
At the same time,  there was a tremendous sense of
 
anomie, dissociation. Who am I? Where am I from?
 
One of the most vivid memories of my father, when I
 
was about eight or nine years old,  1929,  1930, he
 
had just come back from a car trip; we were living
 
in Dallas, Texas at the time. He came in the house
 
with the paper and said to my mother,  "I don't know
 
what's happening to this country!  I would driv
ce
 
along every day,  and every train that would pa s me
 
was covered with bodies of men hanging all over\it.
 
They can't even throw them off anym ore. They us  to
 
be able to throw them off, but now there's too many
 
of them.  I don't know where they think they're
 
going. There isn't any work anywhere." The

depression had disrupt
 people's, lives and it
 
moved people in huge num bers. And then you had
 
World War Two, another massive disruption. People
 
moving here to there to start working in new
 
industries,  or go to prepare for war. A t
'rrific
 
sense of un-rootedness swept the country.
 at same
 
thing certainly happened in other countrie
as
 
well, particularly those countries directly
 
involved in the war, but I think a lot of
 
intelligent and sensitive young people, here, were
 
looking desperately for something of solidity they
 
could cling on to,  and here was all this marvelous
 
music. The other nice thing about American folk
 
music of that period was that it didn't seem like
 
it was so hard.  It didn't seem like you were going
 
to have to spend the rest of your life being a
 
musician in order to play 'Tom Dooley",  for
 
example. Anybody could pick that up.
 
The so called "folk revival" was reall
an
 
adapta ion of the\e American songs being detached 
from thè people wh
riginally invented them and
 
sang t
 hem
and who
 original cultural property
 
they were. These songs got picked up by young
 
professionals like yourself,  and me,  as far as that
 
went.  I don't consider the Almanac Singers the
 
least bit different,  in these terms,  from the Lime
 
Lighters or The Kingston Trio,  or whoever else. The
 
Almanac Singers were singing in more political
 
circumstances and had a particular interest in
 
working with unions and things like that, but we
 
were doing the same things to the songs.  In fact,
 
when we sang to unions, union people would come up
 
to us afterword and say,  "What are you doin',  doin'
 
this stuff? You're not miners,  or garment workers,
 
what are you doin'? This i n't your stuff." And
 
they were right. We were university kids. We were
 
picking it up because we lik

What was your experience of Leadbelly?
 
Bess Lomax Hawes:
 
a
la
 
Being a black gentleman,  ar und a white woman
 
teenager, Leadbelly was very1 polite to me, very
 
cautious. Chances of us getting to be really good
 
friends were very small,  even though he stayed at
 
our house,  ate at our table,  and drove with father.

He was always reserved. And I think he was what you
 
could call institutionalized.  I think he had had
 
profound personality changes as a result of being
 
incarcerated most of his life,  and under extremely
 
tough conditions.  I think he had walled off most of
 
his insides and never showed them. I don't think
 
people understood that about Leadbelly.

best he could--hç had no other flay to make a

ho was feeding of
 
the passions of his 1±te. I d i't know if he ever
 
relaxed with anyone exc
Rt his wife,  and his niece,
 
Tiny. The only time I eve heard him laugh out loud
 
was at a party when John  en r Faulk  a radio man,
 
folklorist,  and story  el1er--was joking about the
 
prison guards at Sue-rland penitentiary, where
 
,, Leadbelly had been  Faulk had collected material

As a singer,  of course, he just flattened you. He
 
was, physically, a very strong man. One of my most
 
vivid memories of Leadbelly was going in a car with
 
him. There was Alan,  and father,  I don't remember
 
who else, but about six of us,  in a Ford. We were
 
driving out to Connecticut.  It was in the middle of
 
winter,  the roads were snowy,  and we got stuck in a
 
snow drift. We tried to drive out of it, back and
 
forth, but we couldn't. We all piled out. Leadbelly
 
walked to the front of the car, picked it up and
 
moved it over,  then walked to the back of the car,
 
picked it up and moved it over. Everybody got back
 
in the car and we drove off. He didn't even strain.

He was just an enormously powerful human being,  and
 
very fast.  If you look at his pictures in his
 
suits, he sort of bulged in them. That was all hard
 
muscle. That's one of the reasons he .-was able to
 
stay alive in the pen,  I suspect.

You couldn't capture what Leadbelly sounded like at

When I came to New York (
1949/1950)  there were kids
 
in Washington Square singing folk songs. How did
 
they happen to be there doing that? Was that only
 
because of your efforts, your brother's,  Pete
 
Seeger's and all that? Or was the music alive in
 
New York,  apart from that, as well?
 
Bess Lomax Hawes:
 
I don't know for sure, but I think you're thinking
 
of a period when folk music was hot,  and there were
 
a lot of people who liked it, and were also
 
performing it. Then, within a period of five or ten
 
years a lot of those people were also studying
 
Flamenco guitar, or deciding they wanted to write
 
the great American novel or something. And they
 
weren't out in Washington Square any longer.  It had
 
peaked and crested.  It was still there, but not in
 
the quantity that it was at one time.  I don't think
 
anything different happened in New York than
 
happened anywhere else,  though,  except,  there were
 
just a lot more people in New York.

Erik:
 
In and around Washington Square arguments would
 
ensue now and again about what is a folk song?
 
From a musicalogical point of view,  what would you
 
say a folk song is?
 
Bess Lomax Hawes:
 
Well,  you've got to distinguish between a folk song
 
and the performance.  The song is the thing,  and
 
then the singer or the performer is the artist.  I
 
happen to feel that when Marion Anderson sang an
 
African American spiritual,  it was a totally
 
different thing than when Vera Hall sang it. When
 
Marion Anderson sang it,  it was a beautiful song,
 
but it had been taken completely out of its
 
original style and moved into the concert style.
 
And so,  to me,  it's not any more the same thing.
 
The song can be picked up,  the tune replicated,  and
 
the words replicated,  but when you hear someone of
 
a truly different artistic and cultural experience
 
attempt to sing it,  a part of its essence is
 
completely changed.  You can say of a song that it
 
has moved in and out of different areas.  A folk
 
melody can have been used by Beethoven in one of
 
his symphonies,  and then it went back into the
 
common language and was sung throughout Austria in
 
rural areas,  and then,  later,  it got changed into
 
thus and so.  It becomes a different thing,
 
depending on how and where it's used.
 
A folk song performance,  however,  isn't authentic
 
at all,  in terms of its being a part of its roots,
 
if the song isn't done by the people who originally
 
produced it.  But authenticity,  per se,  isn't the
 
only criterion.  A good example is Maxine Sullivan
 
who bopped up a lot of children's game songs.  And I
 
think she was superb.  She had a beautiful voice,
 
and she did those songs exquisitely.  She made them
 
into something quite different than they originally
 
were,  however.  They weren't authentic children's
 
game songs any more,  they were authentic Maxine
 
Sullivan jazz tunes.  For me,  though,  over time,  the
 
most moving performances have always been by the
 
people whose original cultural property the music
 
was.  There's another

/4/97

qualifier there,  however.  Those original people
 
were not,  all of them,  always great art people
 
within their own tradition.  There's only one
 
Leadbelly,  and there were a lot of black convicts
 
who sang their indigenous music.  Leadbelly happened
 
to be one of the unique ones.  For me,  his
 
performances came across almost always as being the
 
finest of whatever it was he was singing.  It's a
 
combination of having a superb artist,  who is also
 
doing the music of his own culture,  the stuff from
 
the culture he was raised in.
 
People tend to feel there's only one kind of thing
 
that's any good,  and I don't think that's true.  I
 
think there are lots of things that are any good.
 
They vary,  sometimes,  in their degree of goodness.
 
I use to go with father on some of his collecting
 
trips,  and,  boy,  it was a bore,  sometimes. As Alan
 
says,  "One of the reasons I started thinking about
 
style was that I had to have something to think
 
about as I was listening to the nine-thousandth
 
version of  'Barbary Allen' that I recorded in my
 
life."
 
Erik:
 
What was your experience of folk music in
 
1940,  1941?
 
Bess Lomax Hawes:
 
I' m a complicated case because my father  (John
 
Lomax) ,
 as you probably remember,  was a folklorist.
 
My father and brother were great field men.  My
 
brother still is.  They had done an enormous amount
 
of recording in the field.  Those two guys,  plus
 
fifteen or twenty other major collectors of the
 
twenties,  thirties,  and forties had collected a lot
 
of material.  The earliest published big collection
 
was Carl Sandberg's.  But a lot of people had been
 
working in different sections of the country.
 
Father and my brother,  Alan,  specialized mostly in
 
the Southwest and South,  primarily in the South.
 
Other people,  as well,  in other places had done an
 
extensive job in collecting and making available
 
music in recorded form.  For the first time,  not
 
just in books,  you could hear the voices of the

singers and how extraordinary their music really
 
was.  This gorgeous stuff was just lying around in
 
archives in the Library of Congress and available
 
to people.  I had participated with father and Alan
 
in some of their work.
 During vacations,  while I
 
was in college,  I helped out on research projects,
 
worked with the Library of Congress,  and I' d been
 
with father on a couple of recording sessions.  I
 
had talked with my brother,  Alan,  a lot,  and had
 
studied transcribing music with Ruth Seeger,
 
briefly.  She lived in Washington,  also,  at the
 
time.  So,  in a sense,  I was sort of dropped into it
 
all as a kid.
 
The United States,  as my brother put it,  has been
 
the end-point of most of the major human
 
migrations,  starting with the American Indians--
probably coming over the land bridges from Asia;
 
then there were the European migrations;  and the
 
Africans were brought here.  They didn't want to
 
come,  but they wound up here in large numbers.  When
 
their art forms mingled in this country,  they went
 
into creative explosions of one kind or another,  so
 
that there was a tremendous amount of
 
inventiveness. At that time,  father and Alan were
 
picking up on indigenous music being created here
 
that had never been heard anywhere else before.
 
Chain gang songs or the black work songs never had
 
happened like this. Not to say that work songs
 
didn't exist,  but those particular kinds of songs
 
were not part of the African continental
 
experience,  they were Afro-American.
 Blues,  jazz,
 
hillbilly,  all of it boiling up here as fast as it
 
could boil.
 
At the same time,  there was a tremendous sense of
 
anomie,  dissociation. Who am I? Where am I from?
 
One of the most vivid memories of my father,  when I
 
was about eight or nine years old,  1929,  1930,  he
 
had just come back from a car trip; we were living
 
in Dallas,  Texas at the time.  He came in the house
 
with the paper and said to my mother,  "I don't know
 
what's happening to this country!  I would drive
 
along every day,  and every train that would pass me
 
was covered with bodies of men hanging all over it.
 
They can't even throw them off anymore.  They used
 
to be able to throw them off,  but now there's too
 
many of them.  I don't know where they think they're
 
going.  There isn't any work anywhere." The
 
depression had disrupted people's entire lives and

it moved people in huge numbers.  And then you had
 
World War Two,  another massive disruption.  People
 
moving here to there to start working in new
 
industries,  or go to prepare for war. A terrific
 
sense of un-rootedness swept the country.  That same
 
thing certainly happened in other countries as
 
well,  particularly those countries directly
 
involved in the war,  but I think a lot of
 
intelligent and sensitive young people,  here,  were
 
looking desperately for something of solidity they
 
could cling on to,  and here was all this marvelous
 
music.  The other nice thing about American folk
 
music of that period was that it didn't seem like
 
it was so hard.  It didn't seem like you were going
 
to have to spend the rest of your life being a
 
musician in order to play 'Tom Dooley",  for
 
example. Anybody could pick that up.
 
The so called "folk revival" was really an
 
adaptation of these American songs detached from
 
the people who originally invented them and sang
 
them and whose original cultural property they
 
were.  These songs got picked up by young
 
professionals like yourself,  and me,  as far as that
 
went.  I don't consider the Almanac Singers the
 
least bit different,  in these terms,  from the Lime
 
Lighters or The Kingston Trio,  or whoever else.  The
 
Almanac Singers were singing in more political
 
circumstances and had a particular interest in
 
working with unions and things like that,  but we
 
were doing the same things to the songs.  In fact,
 
when we sang to unions,  union people would come up
 
to us afterword and say,  "What are you doin',  doin'
 
this stuff? You're not miners,  or garment workers,
 
what are you doin'? This isn't your stuff." And
 
they were right. We were university kids. We were
 
picking it up because we liked the music and we
 
believed in the union cause.
 
Erik:
 
What was your experience of Leadbelly?
 
Bess Lomax Hawes:
 
Being a black gentleman,  around a white woman
 
teenager,  Leadbelly was very formal and polite to
 
me,  very cautious.  Chances of us getting to be
 
really good friends were very small,  even though he

stayed at our house,  ate at our table,  and drove
 
with father.
 
He was always reserved. And I think he was what you
 
could call institutionalized.  I think he had had
 
profound personality changes as a result of being
 
incarcerated most of his life,  and under extremely
 
tough conditions.  I think he had walled off most of
 
his insides and never showed them.  I don't think

be charged with first degree murder.  But it was
 
always a hot blooded fight.  Nobody ever said he got
 
up in the morning with the intention of going out
 
to kill so and so.  But there's no question,  he
 
killed three people.  It was kind of scary.  But

Enclosed you will find an earlier communication from me that
 
wandered vaguely overseas to Australia,  circled unhappily for
 
a bit  (
couldn't decide between 84 and 64)  and finally decided
 
to go back home,  only to find I had moved.  The US P.0 kept on
 
trying,  bless them -- it did take a lot of months though.  I
 
am so glad you kept your patience and sent me a Christmas
 
card or I wouldn't have known how to reach you.  I hasten to
 
state it
 was all my fault,  I had miscopied your address.
 
Anyway we are back in touch now,  and I have dutifully sent
 
all your kind messages on to Alan.  He is still with Anna at
 
her home at:
 
301 North Spring Boulevard
 
Tarpon Springs,  Florida,  34689
 
Ana tells me he loves to hear from his friends and wants to
 
know what they're doing.  He understands,  I suspect,  a lot
 
more than he can articulate even now.

Dear Mr.  Shurley:
 
I spoke with my brother,  Alan Lomax,  about your interest  in
 
"Utah Carroll".  I'll try to summarize the gist of our
 
conversation.
 
Both of us  feel that  it  is unlikely that additional written
 
information concerning Utah Carroll exists unless  it turns up
 
in holdings  in the Lomax mss.collection at the Barker
 
Memorial Library at the University of Texas or in the Austin
 
and Alta Fife reference room at Utah State University at
 
Logan,  Utah. (
I do not think I have either of these sources
 
correctly titled,  but the  local  librarians can set you
 
straight.)  The latter library,  though geographically distant,
 
is probably superior for your needs,  because the Fifes  spent
 
their latter years  systematically collecting every scrap of
 
information they could find concerning cowboy songs and
 
sorting it all out.  They copied every relevant document  in my
 
father's  files,  as well as everybody else's they could lay
 
their hands on,  so that their holdings are always the best
 
place to start.
 
Austin Fife  is  long dead and I believe Alta passed away
 
a few years ago;  I do not know who is  curating their room in
 
the Utah State  library,  but you could write
 
Dr.  Barre Toelken
 or Dr.  Steve  Siporin
 
Utah State University
 
Library l06A
 
Logan,  Utah 48322-3042-3032
 
and I am sure they would forward your request to the proper
 
person.  They may,  of course,  just say you'll have to come and
 
look it up for yourself;  if you have a chance to go,  you' d
 
find it an interesting place,  I think.
 
Both Alan and I agree with you that Utah Carroll was probably
 
at the time a more or less  recent compositition that changed
 
relatively little,  though I suspect that the process my
 
brother calls  "creative forgetting" had already started to
 
work in your mother's version,  which shortened the total
 
ballad from 17 verses to a tighter and more  interesting
 
11. (This happened to a number of the greatest  songs;  Alan
 
talks about  it  in Folksongs of North America.)  We do not know
 
just why our father decided to print the Thorne version,
 
though he may have simply thought more people might  find the
 
longer version more useful.  Neither one of us knows anything
 
about Mr.  Thorne;  he was most  likely one of father's
 
multitudinous western correspondents whose  letters didn't
 
survive.  Perhaps
 a reference to him may turn up  in the Fife
 
material.
 
If all this  sounds  impossibly careless,  you must think back a
 
little.  It was a different world.  Few people realize that
 
father at no time,  even when he was working at the Library of
 
Congress,  had so much as a secretary to help him,  much less
 
the trained archivist he needed.  He did it all himself with
 
the occasional help of his children and his  first and second
 
wives.  When I turned up from school over holidays,  I helped
 
type his  letters,  but most of them went out  in his own
 
beautiful Spencerian hand-writing and it took a long time to
 
write them.  No copies,  obviously,  were made.
 
Most of his cowboy material was either recorded on wax
 
cyllinders  (
the bulk of which melted during a terrible Texas
 
summer before father knew how to handle them,  the few
 
survivors  crumbling long ago);  or the texts were sent in via
 
letters  from people responding to the many communications
 
father addressed to the editors of county newspapers asking
 
for the rest of the verses to some particular song.  He' d get
 
bits and pieces  from many correspondents and then every once
 
in a while he would patch several versions together to try to
 
make it the way he thought  it might have been originally.
 
Nobody else that he could find knew what  its original form
 
was either,  so  I guess he felt his guess was as good as
 
anybody's.  And I suspect  it was probably better.  He may have
 
kept notes as to how he did this,  but we don't know where
 
they are,  and frankly I doubt he bothered.
 
For at that time,  few people thought any of this  stuff was
 
particularly important;  if you recall,  the first  cowboy song
 
books  father edited were completely un-annotated.  Nobody then
 
cared who had sung them;  it was only in the later editions
 
that he tried to recreate the specific information he had
 
known but hadn't been encouraged to include all those years
 
before.  He had thought,  I suspect,  that he was  simply
 
presenting the American people with samples,  common to all of
 
them,  of their own great creativity.It only got complicated
 
much much later.
 
I hope  I' m not  sounding defensive.  I don't  intend to;  it's
 
just difficult to explain quite how casual as well as how
 
intense the whole operation was.  Nowadays with copyrights and
 
million dollar recording contracts  in the balance,  everybody
 
is thinking intensely about the money  (which,  as always,  is
 
seldom seen)  and hardly anybody is casual at all.  I hope you
 
are.  I liked the last paragraph in your letter very much and
 
hope that  in your review of your own life this particular
 
curiosity can eventually be gratified.  If I can do any more
 
to help the cause,  please  let me know.
 
Cordially,

WE SPOKE AND I
NTRODUCED OURSELVES, AND YOU GAVE ME YOUR CARD I
N
 
AUSTIN (LA ZONA ROSA) AT THE TIME YOU SPOKE AND SANG AT THE "TEXAS
 
COUNTRY (MUSIC) ROOTS" FESTIVAL.  YOUR S
ISTER, SHIRLEY LOMAX DUGGAN
 
FROM LUBBOCK WAS ALSO THERE WITH YOU.
 I
 AM A BIG, TALL, TEXAN
 
FEDERAL RETIREE NOW LIVING I
N AUSTIN, AND I
 RECALL THESE FACTS AS AN
 
I
NTRODUCTION AND PRELUDE TO AN I
NITIATIVE I
 BEGAN THAT DAY TO UPDATE
 
AND GET A CURRENT "FIX" ON THE STATUS OF A COWBOY BALLAD THAT I
 
SANG AND PROVIDED WORDS FOR TO YOUR FATHER, JOHN A
. LOMAX,  I
N SAN
 
ANGELO TEXAS S
IXTY YEARS AGO. A
 LAD OF F
IFTEEN,  I
 WAS ENCOURAGED TO DO
 
THIS BY MY FATHER,IRA SHURLEY, WHO APPARENTLY HAD BECOME ACQUAINTED
 
WITH YOUR FATHER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN, DURING THE S
INGLE
 
YEAR,  1
911-12, WHEN MY FATHER ATTENDED SCHOOL THERE.
 
A
s THE ENCLOSED COPIES SHOW, MY BRIEF CONTACT WITH JOHN LOMAX
 
RESULTED I
N A FOOTNOTE I
N THE 1
945 EDITION OF COWBOY SONGS A
ND OTHER  
FRONTIER BALLADS, MACMILLAN,  N
.Y., PAGE 1
25  ABOUT MY SUGGESTION ABOUT
 
A POSSIBLE ORIGIN FOR THE BALLAD.
 I
 D
ID NOT SEE THE BOOK PROBABLY UNTIL
 
THE EARLY 1
970's1 AND THEN I
 TOOK NO ACTION REGARDING THE MATTER.
 
Now, SERENDIPITOUSLY, THE OPPORTUNITY SEEMS TO HAVE ARISEN TO
 
LEARN A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THE MATTER, AND TO CLARIFY IT FOR THE POSSIBLE
 
I
NTERESTS OF MY CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN.
 
YOUR FATHER CHOSE TO USE AND PRINT A VERSION OF "UTAH CARROLL" THAT
 
HE ATTRIBUTES TO AN F
.C. THORNE, OF F
T. WORTH, T
X  WHO I
S NOT FURTHER
 
I
DENTIFIED.  WAS HE A SONGWRITER,
 OR PERFORMER, WHO CLAIMED AUTHORSHIP
 
OR S
IMPLY FAMILIARITY AND USAGE?  WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SLIGHTLY D
IFFERENT
 
VERSION MY MOTHER HANDED DOWN TO ME, AND I
 GAVE A COPY TO YOUR FATHER?
 
I
 ENCLOSE A COPY HERE,  SO THAT YOU MAY KNOW, AND JUDGE FOR YOURSELF I
F
 
YOU PREFER ONE VERSION OVER THE OTHER,  -
 AS I
 DO;  NAMELY, MY MOTHER'S.
 
(
SHE DIED I
N 1
973).  I
 DO NOT RECALL THE NAME OF THE COWBOY POET TO WHOM
 
SHE ATTRIBUTED THE ORIGIN OF THE BALLADI AND IT I
S NO WHERE RECORDED.
 
A
S I
 UNDERSTAND IT, YOUR FATHER FOUND IT AS RARE AS IT WAS FRUSTRATING
 
TO BE ABLE TO TRACE THE ORIGIN OF ANY BALLAD TO A SPECIFIC SOURCE.  AND
 
IT I
S TOTALLY UNSURPRISING TO F
IND MANY VERSIONS OF THE SAME SONG.
 
"UTAH CARROLL" MAY S
IMPLY BE A CASE I
N POINT.  WHAT DO YOU KNOW,  AND WHAT
 
DO YOU THINK?
 
IF THE MATTER I
 HERE DISCUSS,  AND THE I
SSUES RAISED, ARE I

Dear  Bess  -
 
Ah,  the  post moves  in mysterious ways!  Thanks  so  very
 
much  for  your  letter,  which will  be a part of  the  "support"
 
for
 my/our permanent residency,  as well as  possibly  in
 
aid of  getting work.  The market here has  imploded recently
 
(good  timing!?!),  but I'll soon be in a position vis a vis
 
immigration to  generate my own work in many ways.  So far,  I've
 
given a seminar at  Sydney University,  and  I've gotten a few
 
things  published  (no  pay)  in music magazines.  Been asked to
 
do something  for Perfect Beat, the Pacific Journal of Research
  
into Contemporary Music & Popular Culture next  year,  so I'll
 
be able to  show my wares a bit.  Also,  there has been a two-part
 
interview with me  in Rhythms, a popular music journal..,  a
 
famous  first!  It ain't  easy being the world's  formost authority
 
on something  that  few give a damn about.
 
I have  sent Alan a post card  to  the FL address...  thanks.
 
You are  the master of tact  to say  that Alan  "wasn't exactly
 
restful even before all  this."
 Also  the master  of understate-
ment!  I do hope  that he  improves.
 
We have had a fine and  restful holiday  time here -
 no
 
obligations  save ourselves,  and no miserable weather to cope
 
with.  From what  I've heard  in the  press,  D.C.  hasn't been too
 
wonderful
 this winter..,  good move,  going  to CA.If you do
 
head  in this  general  direction,  by all means do come here and
 
stay with us.  I have a friend at Berkeley who may be going
 
to  the Philippines  in May,  and will  extend  to here.  NZ is  even
 
closer.
 
So  the Folk Arts Program is no more.  How economical and
 
short-sighted.  What  in the world are  they  thinking  (oops,  I
 
forgot,  "thinking"  is not  the operative word).  Joe Hickerson
 
& his  Impressive Stationery have  been contacted,  but his wheels
 
grind  exceeding  slow..,  nothing new there!
 
As  for  the  Rounder  project.  It's  too  bad  that  some sort
 
of combination of  the Prestige International  "Southern Jour-
ney" material with the Atlantic series couldn't be effected.
 
The were all  recorded during the same set  of  field-trips,  to
 
the best  of my knowledge..  Certainly a reunion would be a good
 
thing.  It's been  years since I've had any contact with Ahme
 
Ertegun,  but  I'll  try  if  that would  help.
 
The  "Black River of  Song"  series is very much of  inter-
est  to me,  and  I'd  be happy  to help  in any way possible.  My
 
being here  isn't  quite the  barrier  that  it once was -
 the mail
 
(for  tapes,  photos)  can be done in five days or  less,  while
 
my  phone is also a fax and that  is almost  instantaneous.  I
 
will
 write  to Anna in the next week or so and  see  if I can't
 
be  useful  in some  fashion.
 
Once again,  thanks  for  your support.  No need  to apologise
 
for any  glitches  in the system,  no matter whose system is  in-
volved!  Our  best  to  you.
 
You
