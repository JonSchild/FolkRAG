Hootenanny magazine is
 
proud to present excerpts of
 
a few letters from Mr. See-
ger, as received by Harold
 
Leventhal, his manager.
 A
 
forthcoming issue will have
 
a complete report on the
 
Seeger family's trip.)
 
New Delhi,  India, Dec. 6
 
I am going to do my best to
 
persuade more American art-
ists to try to come to India
 
they will want to come
 
here to study music for long
 
years, in the same way
 
Americans now spend years
 
studying opera in Italy
 
When I
 visited Santi-
niketan, and was shown
 
through his  (
Sir Rabindra-
nath Tagore, the noted Hindu
 
poet who lived from 1861 to
 
1941)  home and the museum,
 
I could see that he had been
 
practically deified, or at
 
least saintified.  This is a
 
hard fate for any great man.
 
Those who really love any
 
man or woman must actively
 
guard against it .
 .
 .  Cul-
tural works are never the
 
product  of any one person.
 
We are all the product of
 
thousands of hard-working
 
humans
 
New Delhi, India, Dec. 7
 
The traditional music
 
here is, I feel, in a lot
 
stronger position than in
 
Japan, because they have
 
such a strong tradition of
 
improvisation.  The old
 
music is continually being
 
made new.  Where the kotb-
player in Japan was often
 
trying in his mind to be as
 
great a musician as some
 
master of the 18th century,
 
the sitar-player builds a
 
personal new improvisation
 
upon the basis of the tune
 
given him by the ancient
 
master.
 
I
 feel .  .  . very optimistic
 
about the prospects for the
 
future of Indian music: they
 
have such a fabulous variety
 
of it, and such a deep love
 
for it throughout the en-
tire population .  .  . West-
ern music has not made too
 
much impression on Indians,
 
because their own music
 
is good
 
New Delhi, India Dec. 7
 
I was in Tokyo when the
 
terrible news of Kennedy's
 
murder came .  .  .  only a mad-
man would think that assas-
sination could help any
 
cause of any sort .  .  .  I
 won-
der if the lesson I draw
 
from it.all is felt by anyone
 
else?  That our whole world
 
is so armed to the teeth,
 
that it, too, could be as-
sassinated by one madman's
 
hand on the trigger?
 
Here we are absorbed
 
in learning something about
 
a huge and poverty-stricken
 
country.  Four hundred mil-
lion people!  Some people
 
with fairly good jobs get
 
paid two or three rupees a
 
day.  A rupee is about 27
 
cents.  But 50 per cent of the
 
country, according to a re-
cent debate in the Indian
 
Parliament,  receive about 4
 
or 5 cents a day.  Ten per
 
cent of Calcutta's 6
,000,000
 
sleep in the streets.
 
Bombay, India, Dec. 10
 
The trip has been an
 
education for all five of
 
us.  We have a sense of the
 
geography of the world we
 
never had: the immense dry-
ness of Australia, the moist
 
greenness of Java. Lotsa
 
hills in Japan. And now
 
India.
 
Bombay, India, Dec. 10
 
I sang for an hour to
 
about 100, mostly profes-
sors .  .  .  I asked if India
 
had new songs made up to old
 
tunes. .  . One man said yes,
 
but mainly of two types:
 
political songs, written
 
for this or that campaign,
 
and religious songs.
 The
 
latter would often consist
 
of religious words to a pop
 
tune from a current movie!
 
I asked, are there young
 
song-writers like Bob Dylan
 
from the city? No, he said,
 
it was mostly a rural tradi-
tion, and not as vigorous
 
All I know is that as I
 
look out of our plane win-
dow at the vast brown land-
scape below, I feel pity for
 
the millions there who have
 
so little chance in this
 
world.  There but for the
 
grace of God go we.  If you
 
or I
 had been born down there
 
--and had the good fortune
 
to survive the diseases
 
which decimate every family,
 
I guess we also would have
 
that lean and hungry look,
 
and faithfully tie our tur-
bans in the way our fore-
fathers had always done,

 I took Sassafrass to the swimmin'  hole,
 
I kissed her in the water and don't you know,
 
The steam rose high as a cloud in the sky
 
And the old swimmin'  hole went dry.

 Next day she kissed me in the city park,
 
Bells started ringin'  and it got dark,
 
Well the Army and the Navy couldn't keep folks calm,
 
They thought it was a hydrogen bomb.

 I

And feed '

2.
 Rain quit and the wind got high,
 
And a black old dust storm filled the sky,
 
And I swapped my farm for a Ford machine,
 
And I poured it full of gasoline.
 
I started rocking and rolling
 
Over the mountains out towards
 
The old Peach Bowl.
 
3.
 Way up yonder on the mountain road
 
I had a hot motor and a heavy load,
 
I was going pretty fast,
 
I wasn't even stopping.
 
A-bouncing up and down like a pop corn popping.
 
I had a breakdown,
 
Sort of nervous bustdown of some kind,
 
And was a fellow there,
 a mechanic fellow
 
Said it was engine trouble.
 
4.
 Way up yonder on a mountain curve,
 
It was way up yonder in the piney woods,
 
I gave that rolling Ford a shove,
 
And was going to coast as far as I could.
 
Commence coasting,
 
Picked up speed with a half-in turn.
 
I did not make  it.
 
5
.
 Man alive,
 I
'm telling you the fiddles
 
And the guitars really flew.
 
That Ford took off like a flying squirrel,
 
And it flew half way around the world.
 
Scattered wife and children all over
 
The sides of that mountain.
 
6.
 We got out to the West coast broke,
 
I was so hungry I thought I would croak.
 
I bummed up a spud or two,
 
My wife fixed up a I
tater stew.
 
Filled three of the kids full of it.
 
Mighty thin stew,
 though,
 you could read
 
A magazine right through it.
 
7.
 Always have figured that if it had been
 
Just a little bit thinner
 
Some of these politicians could have
 
Seen through it.

 When gracious Anne became our queen,

To these I do allegiance swear -

2.
 At about the age of sixteen
 
I joined this jolly band,
 
We marched from Western Texas
 
Down to the Rio Grande.
 
4.
 Oh I saw the Indians coming,
 
I heard them give a yell,
 
My feelings at that moment
 
My courage almost fell.
 
6
.
 There lay six as noble a rangers
 
As ever sought the west,
 
Besides all their comrades
 
With bullets in their breasts.
 
8.
 Oh then I thought that she was childish
 
And the best she did not know,
 
My mind was bent on rambling
 
And I was forced to go.
 
3.
 Our captain,
 he informed us
 
To what he thought was right,
 
Before we reached the station
 
Says:
 Boys,
 you'll have to fight.
 
5
.
 We fought them nine long hours
 
Before the fray was o'er,
 
The like of dead and wounded
 
I never saw before.
 
7
.
 I then thought of my dear mother,
 
In tears to me did say:
 
To you they are all strangers,
 
With me you'd better stay.
 
9
.
 Perhaps you all have mothers,
 
Likewise a sister,
 too,
 
Perhaps you all have sweethearts
 
To weep and mourn for you.
 
10.
 If this be your condition
 
And you are forced to roam,
 
I
'll tell you from experience
 
You had better stay at home.

 He's a Catholic,
 A Hindu,
 An Athiest,

A Buddhist and A Baptist and A Jew,

 and he knows he always will,
 
Kill you,

 and me for you.

 And he's fighting for Canada,
 he's fighting for France,
 
He's fighting for the U.  S. A.,
 
He's fighting for the Russians and he's fighting for Japan,
 
And he thinks we'll put an end to war that way.
 
4.
 And he's fighting for Democracy,
 he's fighting for the Reds,
 
He says it's for the peace of all.
 
He's the one who must decide who's to live and who's to die,
 
And he never sees the writing on the wall.
 
5
.
 But without him how could Hitler have condemned him at Dachau,
 
Without him Caesar would have stood alone,
 
He's the one who gives his body as a weapon of the war,
 
And without him all this killing can't go on.
 
6.
 He's the Universal Soldier and he really is to blame,
 
His orders come from far away no more,
 
They come from him and you and me,
 and
 
Brothers,
 can't you see
 
This is not the way we put an end to war.

So f

t c

and you c

You c

chieve a l
ot o
f variety
 
by p
laying both t
hese s

d

Here's how t
o do i
t
. I
n your mind,
 
d
ivide e
ach o
f t
he two beats o
f t
he
 
2
/4 s

nto two s
ub-beats. I
n
 
o
ther words you now have f
our
 
half-beats t
o a measure i
nstead o
f
 
two whole beats.
 
On t
he f
i
rst half-beat —pluck a
 
bass s
tring down with t
he t
humb.
 
On t
he s
econd half-beat —pluck
 
t
he t

On t
he t

On t
he f
ourth half-beat —pluck
 
t
he f

Don't r

ON BUYING GUITARS
 
In 1
951 I
 walked i
nto a
 j
unk s
hop
 
i
n San Francisco and purchased a
 
guitar f
or $
37.50. I
t d
idn't have any
 
l
abel on i
t and i
t had an e
xtremely
 
t
hick neck. When I
 put new s
trings
 
on i
t I
 was amazed a
t i
ts beautiful
 
r
ich t
one. I
 have been p
laying t
hat
 
guitar ever s
ince.
 
S
ince t
hen I
 have s
hown i
t t
o i
n-
numerable guitarists and r
epairmen
 
but no one c
ould g
ive me a c

t
. Other t
han t
he
 
opinion t
hat "
it l
ooks l
ike an I
talian
 
guitar." I
ts o
rigins a
re unknown. A
 
f
ew years a
fter I
 bought i
t I
 had a
 
s
tudent i
n a
 guitar c
lass i
n Berkeley
 
who had i
ts i
dentical twin, but he.
 
t
oo, was unable t
o t
ell  me where h
is
 
guitar c
ame f
rom.
 
With s
teel s
trings i
t s
ounds l
ike
 
an o
rgan, t
he t
ones a
re s
ustained
 
and r
ich e
specially on t

he  f
ingerboard.  With  nylon
 
s
trings i
ts t
one i

l
ike t
hat o
f a l
ute. I
t i
s t
he only
 
guitar I
 have ever owned e
xcept f
or
 
an f
-hole i
nstrument, on which I
 
s
tarted p
laying. I
 t
raded t
he f
-hole
 
f
or a
 l
i
ttle Dobson banjo. The Dob-
s
on had a l
ovely bell-like t
one, but
 
was t
oo small f
or me.
 
The best banjo I
 ever had was a
 
Fairbahks White  Lady,  which  I
 
p
layed f
or a
lmost 1
0 years. I got
 
t
hat i
nstrument f
or $
15 i
n a j
unk
 
s
hop i
n Kingston, N. Y., and I
 s
old

I

o t
urned a

old
 
i
t f
or $
150.00.) We c
an't g

unk
 
dealers and s
econd-hand s
tores a
re
 
a
ll a
cutely aware o
f t
he demand f
or
 
i
nstruments  and t
heir prices  a
re
 
v
ery h
igh.
 
My advice i
f you a
re r
eady t
o
 
buy a guitar i
s t
o s
ave your money
 
and buy  a new guitar o
f  good
 
quality. I
f you c
an s
pend a
round
 
$
200 you c
an g
et a guitar t
hat will
 
outlive you with proper c
are and i
t
 
will improve i
n t
one and value a
s
 
i
t ages.
 
But above a
ll, don't buy a very
 
f
ine guitar unless you a
re s
ure you
 
know e
xactly what you want. Then
 
make s
ure you a
re g
etting what
 
your cheap, i
nexpensive, borrowed
 
o
r s
tolen i
nstrument until you a
re
 
f
amilair  with  your  own  musical
 
c
apabilities and t
astes.
 
When you buy a new i
nstrument
 
f
or $
35 o
r $40, you a
re t
hrowing
 
your money away. I
t i
s possible t
o
 
g
et good s
econd-hand i
nstruments
 
f
or t
hat k
ind o
f money, but be s
ure
 
you have s
omeone with you who
 
knows  guitars.  Instruments  c

ook t
errible but be g

When Woody wrote "Bound f

one Narrator and a s

-
 or by two narrators and anywhere up t

The s

There are, as will be seen, no f

AN I
NTRODUCTORY NOTE
 
ABOUT THE MAN AND H
IS MUSIC
 
by Pete Seeger
 
Woodrow Wilson Guthrie, one o
f t
he great f
olk song balladmakers o
f t
his
 
century, wrote more t
han a
 t
housand songs between 1
932 and 1
952. Some
 
may never be worth s
inging. Others may s
tand t
he t
est o
f t
ime, and l
ike
 
"Auld Lang Syne" or "Go Tell Aunt Rhody", beco me world c
lassics. His
 
method o
f co mposition was t
o pound out verse a
fter verse on t
he t
ypewriter,
 
or i
n h
is precise, country s
tyle handwriting, and t
ry i
t out on h
is guitar
 
as he went a
long.  Later t
he song could be pruned down t
o usable s
ize.
 
He put h
is rhy mes t
o t
unes which were, more o
ften t
han not, s
lightly
 
amended versions o
f o
ld f
olk melodies. Thus "Philadelphia Lawyer" used
 
t
he t
une o
f "The J
ealous Lover Of Lone Green Valley".  "Pastures o
f
 
Plenty" used one o
f t
he many versions o
f "Pretty Polly", and "Roll On
 
Columbia" adapted "Goodnight I
rene". He was o
ften not exactly conscious
 
o
f where he got t
he t
une, until i
t was pointed out t
o h
i m.
 
"So Long" used t
he melody o
f
 "The Ballad o
f Billy The Kid" and "Reuben
 
J
ames" used "Wildwood Flower", a
 t
une recorded by t
he Carter Family,
 
well-known country recording artists o
f t
he 1
930's (
and f
rom whose
 
record Woody l
earned many songs, as well as h
is s
tyle o
f guitar p
laying).
 
To both o
f t
hese l
ast songs, however, he added a
 chorus worthy o
f any
 
good co mposer. He f
iddled around with t
he melody o
f t
he verse, until he
 
co mpounded and developed e
le ments o
f i
t i
nto a
 s
ingable refrain.
 
The songs were rarely written t
o order. Anything worth d
iscussing was
 
worth a
 song t
o h
im: news o
ff t
he f
ront page, s
ights and sounds o
f t
he
 
countrysides he t
raveled t
hrough, and t
houghts brought t
o mind by reading
 
anything f
ro m Rabelais t
o Will Rogers. Though some songs became t
op
 
sellers on t
he h
it parade, he never composed with t
he h
it parade i
n mind.
 
I
n f
act, he had a
 rather d
isparaging a
ttitude t
oward Tin Pan Alley and any
 
k
ind o
f com mercial success. Songs were co mposed f
or h
imself and f
riends
 
t
o s
ing, and he had f
aith t
hat a
 good song would get around i
n spite o
f t
he
 
music i
ndustry.
 
When we f
irst proposed i
n 1
956 t
o put on a
 whole evening o
f t
he songs o
f
 
Woody Guthrie, some said: "Oh no!  I
t can't be done successfully. All
 
t
he songs would sound a
like."
 
-
5-
I
t i
s t
rue t
hat most o
f t
he songs use t
he same major t
onic, do minant, and
 
subdominant har monies i
n f
amiliar sequence. Most are i
n a
 moderate 2/4
 
or 4/4 t
ime. But t
he l
yrics o
f t
he songs cover a
 wide range o
f subject
 
matter, and e
ight or t
en s
ingers with widely d
ifferent voices and t
e mpera-
ment shared t
he s
inging chores. I
n t
he perfor mance t
here was no l
ack o
f
 
musical variety whatsoever.
 
A mellifluous baritone t
ook 'Pastures o
f Plenty". Two t
eenage g
irls sang
 
'Do Re Mi" with sweet country-style har mony. Two rougher voiced men
 
swapped verses on "Hard Travelling"; t
hey t
ore o
ff t
he l
ast verse with
 
gusto. The entire audience j
oined i
n on t
he choruses o
f many songs.
 
Any group o
f s
ingers who l
ove American f
olk music can successfully
 
perfor m t
his cantata by s
i milarly d
istributing solos, duets, group numbers,
 
and audience songs so t
hat no one s
inger i
s overworked, i
f any o
f t
he
 
s
ingers are i
n doubt about how t
o perfor m a
 nu mber, have t
he m l
isten t
o
 
such recordings o
f American Folk Music as t
he Folkways LP Series
 
"Anthology o
f American Folk Music". This i
s t
he genre t
o which t
his
 
music belongs. Many o
f t
he songs have been recorded by Woody h
imself
 
(
see d
iscography on P
.44). But a
 caution here!  Beware o
f t
rying t
o
 
imitate Woody's s
inging t
oo c
losely -
-
 i
t will sound f
ake and phony.
 
1
. Don't t
ry and imitate h
is accent.
 
2
. Don't t
ry and imitate h
is f
lat vocal quality.
 
3
. I
n short, be yourself.
 
What any s
inger can l
earn f
rom Woody's method o
f perfor mance are such
 
t
hings as t
his:
 
1
. A matter-of-fact, un melodramatic, understate ment t
hroughout.
 
2
. S
i mplicity above a
ll -
-  and getting t
he words out c
learly. They are
 
t
he most important part o
f t
he song.
 
3
. I
rregularity.
 
This l
ast perhaps needs explanation: t
o avoid a
 s
ing-song e
ffect, f
rom
 
repeating t
he same s
imple melody many t
imes, Woody, l
ike a
ll American
 
ballad s
ingers, held out l
ong notes i
n unexpected p
laces, a
lthough h
is guitar
 
s
trum ming maintained an even t
e mpo. Thus no two verses sounded a
like.
 
Extra beats were o
ften added t
o measures. The melodies are usually changed
 
rhythmically f
ro m verse t
o verse, t
o f
it t
he words exactly. Rarely i
f ever
 
are r
itards used a
t t
he end o
f a
 song. When t
he l
ast verse i
s over, t
he song
 
usually s
tops. (
In t
his script t
he guitar s
trumming o
ften f
ades down under
 
t
he narration preceeding t
he next song.) Tempos o
f each song remain
 
constant f
ro m f
irst verse t
o l
ast. Sudden crescendoes and p
ianissi mos
 
are abjured.
 
Accompani ment should be guitar, or so me o
ther s
imple f
olk i
nstrument,
 
l
ike banjo, ukelele, or soft accordion. I
t would be best t
o s
teer c
lear o
f
 
p
ianos co mpletely, s
ince t
hey would continually d
istract t
he l
istener
 
f
rom t
he general f
olksinging a
t mosphere. The chords written above t
he
 
melody are purposely s
imple. Don't t
ry t
o pretty t
hem up or t
o embelish
 
t
he har mony t
oo much, or you will destroy t
he music. The exact keys,
 
o
f course, can be changed t
o suit t
he s
inger. A guitar capo will be a
 
useful device here. Woody had a
 voice o
f average range, and t
he songs
 
are, by and l
arge, easy t
o s
ing -
-  d
ifficult perhaps only i
n t
hat t
hey are
 
o
ften t

f s
implicity. I

 CHORUS I
S REPEATED, HU M MING,
 
FADING OFF ON THE LAST LINE.
 
NARRATOR
 
His na me i
s Woodrow Wilson Guthrie. . .
 a b
it o
f i
nfor mation
 
which may co me as k
ind o
f a surprise.  Most people don't know
 
he's got any o
ther name but j
ust Woody.
 
He s
tarted out f
ro m Oklahoma, and he t
raveled a
ll o
f t
he f
orty-
e
ight s
tates and most o
f t
he seven seas.  And wherever he went
 
he made music.  He sang and he whistled, he hu mmed and he
 
hooted, he p
layed t
he guitar, t
he mouth harp, t
he mountain f
iddle
 
and t
he mandolin.  I
f he couldn't l
ay h
is hands on a guitar, why
 
he could j
ust bang out a song with a couple o
f spoons.  Or t
ap out
 
a t
une with h
is bare hands on a t
in can.
 
Nobody does know j
ust how many songs he made up.  A collector
 
c
laims t
o have counted up over a t
housand.  But t
hat would j
ust be
 
t
he ones t
hat Woody t
ook t
he t
rouble t
o write down.  I
t wouldn't
 
i
nclude t
he ones t
hat s
lipped away i
n t
he dustry wind, t
he ones
 
t
hat vanished i
n t
he c
lank and rattle o
f a f
reight t
rain crossing
 
t
hrough t
he h
ills i
n t
he darkness.
 
All r
ight, l
et's say he made up a t
housand songs.  Songs with l
ove
 
i
n t

Dear Bess,
 
Thank you so n
uich for sending alone the
 
article and the tape.
 The latter I will
 
forward to Dick as soon as we get a chance
 
to listen to it (at the moment we have only
 
a cassette recorder an d w ill have  to borrow
 
a regular one), the former I find really
 
interesting.
 I'm a bit skeptical of the
 
long-range possibilities of gaining general
 
knowledge from such an approach;
 the
 
so-called behavioralists have been addine
 
things up in a somewhat similar manner for
 
a long time without producing very much
 
in the way of insight or theor7.
 At ,
a mini
-mum
 
however, it appears that your brothers vaste
 
folkloric/musical erudition has led to the
 
development of a truly useful set of catecorie
 
for cross-
u1tura1 comparisons.
 I do hope
 
ht gets past any a priori antipathies he
 
'
eight have, for I
'm sure we have much to lea rb
o 
from him, and in a number of resnects.
 
Again, I so enjoyed the afternoon we xmf
f
 
spent tocrether, and was so shocked when I
 
learned of Butch's death.
 I had hoped t
t
 
Jude would have the pleasure of meeting you
 
both, of L
iaving a chance to discuss our
 
ues
 and impressions of the early forti s
 
a
rid Woodywith You*
 Now we will be a smaller
 
company w
Lien next we meet -
 perhaps in June
 
when we are bac, briefly, or certaiuiy after
 
July, when we .ettle bacx into life in LA.
 
M- -
--while,
 L±t
 up -
-,ot of interest-
ing data in the SW -
 especially from Matt
 
Jennings, a terribly congenial butcher in
 
a
 
paso who, as it turns
 out,
 was  Woody's
 best
 
friend during those formative years in Pampa.
 
We also talked to his first wife just before
 
we left -
 who was a bit laconic but generally
 
cooperative.
 All in all, we r
1avt
 r
 
v vi
 (little bit of ribbon problem enters
 
and hopefully exits at this point) picture
 
of Woody, with detail to be filled in mainly
 
for the years he spent
t
 (more or tess)/\ 
Marjorie. 
 
-  
Think I'd best stop before this borrowed
 
typewriter and I lose all capacity for workir
 
together.
 Jude says to say that she looks
 
forward to meeting you.
 
Be well,  see you come summer.
 
All our best,

"Take I
t Easy, But Take It":  Woody Guthrie and American
 
Social Change
 
I
 
Simply put, the question is one of the relationship between a man and his
 
time.  This age-old conundrum, if posed as the idea of men making history versus
 
that of history making men, is in principle insoluble; but it has recently been
 
restated in a more investigable form.  In Young Man
 
Erik Erikson argues for a synthesis of life history
 
than the reduction of one to the other.
 
1
-
lere juxtaposition may, however, parade itself
 
Luther and his later works,
 
and social history rather
 
as synthesis; and a subtle
 
'
chological interpretation of an individual's life against a formless social
 
kground, then ipso facto social history has been reduced to a lower level
 
of epistemological significance:  the theoretical representation of the inaivi-
dual is accompanied by a purely descriptive representation of society.  Thus
 
a unifying method is needed if a covert one-sidedness is to be avoided.
 
It is exactly such an approach that Jean-Paul. Sartre suggests in Search  
for a Method. Arguing that dialectical materialism remains "
the philosophy
 
of our time" (without which our thoughts are "lost in the void or retrogress"),
 
he goes on to contend that psychoanalysis is "the one privileged mediation
 
which permits [Iarxism] to pass from general and abstract determinations to
 
particular traits of the single individual."  In other words, Sartre is attempt-
ing to fuse psychoanalysis and Marxism into a unified method for first analyzing
 
and then synthesizing the facts of individual and social history.  This fusion
 
results in what Sartre terms the "progressive-regressive method."  From i
ts
 
perspective men are viewed As behaving "both in relation to real and present
 
factors which condition [their actions] and in relation to a certain object,
 
within the present is the determining force of the past, so that men's
 
have a fully stated temporal location.  This location, or moment of act
 
must then be subjected to dialectical scrutiny, so that a rhythm of anal';
