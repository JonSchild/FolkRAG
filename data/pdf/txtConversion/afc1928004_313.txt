Congress in the year 1576, by A. J, 
FisnEa, in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington, 
STYLE OF THE DAY. 
As sung by JEl•TNIE LIND‘CRY. 
I'm a 
jolly young leader of fashion, 
A 
belle that's so festive and free ; 
Of course you will say I 
am dashing, 
For nothing but style snits me ; 
With young swells I 
often go driving. 
They call me so charming and gay, 
That I 
try to outdress all the others, 
And bring out the style of the day. 
( 
Then I 
laugh and I 
wink at the fellows, 
Who oft on their knees to me pray; 
Rut I 
think I 
will have to stay single. 
To bring out the style of the day. 
I 
have many rivals who try to 
Outshine my gay style so fine ; 
But then I 
always can beat them, 
For my Pa he owns a 
gold mine ; 
If I 
owe a 
V, X, or a 
And havn't got it, to pay. 
I 
just send my bill to my parient. 
And he pays for the style of the day. 
Then I 
laugh, and I 
wink. Sze.

THE MODEL OF A 
MAN, 
Words by the lovely Vocalist, JENNIE LINDSAY. 
1).-rdieated to my friend H ARRY BENNETT. 
You have all heard the song of Pull down the blind, 
But another I'll sing just as good, you will find : 
Now, Wipe off your chin, I 
believe is the last, 
But I 
have one still later, ' tis Turn down the gas ! 
Now, I 
loved a 
yomag man so charming and gay, 
Who came round to see me most every day ; 
When we'd kiss and embrace, to me he would say— 
Turn down the gas ! Turn it down right away ! 
SPOKEN.—Yes, he was a 
darling fellow ; whenever he 
came to my house to see me, it was always when Pa and 
Ma were gone to meeting : he would put his arm round 
my neck and say. Jennie. darling,— 
Turn down the gas ! Turn down the gas ! 
Darken the room, love, there's a 
dear lass : 
Though we love each other, remarks may be pass'd. 
So come kiss your Harry and—Turn down the gas ! 
My Harry's a 
darlin,, you etn see at a 
glance. 
And don't he look sweet in his new lavender pants : 
He sings like a 
bird, and oh! can't he dance! 
If you saw him waltzing why you'd go in a 
trance, 
For such style as his was never seen yet— 
He's King of the Fashion, now don't you forget. 
We are going to be married, and I'll never regret 
When I 
turned down the gas for my dear darling pet. 
SPOKEN.-- harry and I 
have been keeping company for 
over a 
year. and mother says it's time he proposed. 
I 
think so too. 
He says he will marry me before the Cen-
tennial is 'over. 
At any rate, I 
hope he loves me just as 
well as when he first courted me, and with a loving 
squeeze told me to please— 
Turn down the gas !" 
BY JENNIE LINDSAY. 
Dedicated to my little friend_ 
Eltux AmEs, Dutch Comedian. 
Of all the Gents I've ever seen,. 
Or in this world have met, 
The one that I 
now speak about 
Is the best of all, you bet ! 
Though in size he's not the greatest--
To his principle I 
allude : 
For in my dealings with him I 
see, 
He is little, but he's good ! 
He never tries an injury 
On friend or foe, to inflict ; 
He is never eager for argument, 
Nor wishes to contradict ; 
He knows not how to criticise, 
And troubles he never would brood 
For he is just the Gentlemen, right out-
He is little. but he's good ! 
The Ladies all admire him, 
And very often say : 
That little model of a 
man 
Steals all our hearts away. 
But this charming love of a 
fellow, 
To steal hearts never would; 
For he is too honest, you'll find him 
Though little, he's so good ! 
THE OPENING SOIREE. 
Words and Music by JENNLE LINDSAY. 
Dedicate 1 
to M R. H ARPY BENNETT, Dutch Comedian and Vocaliit. 
! 
I'm awful fond of dancing, 
To me it seems so sweet ; 
I 
think it's so delightful. 
It is pleasure—real—complete 
With a 
handsome, graceful partner. 
Whose style is gay and free. 
I 
long to hear the welcome news 
Of the Opening Soiree ! 
CHORT-S. 
For I 
dearly love to dance 
To music blithe and free ! 
And, in fact, I'm all impatience 
For the Opening Soiree ! 
Now, I 
own the Summer's pleasant, 
And boating I 
admire : 
I 
am often at the races, 
But of that I 
sometimes tire : 
And I'm longing for the season. 
With its mirth and harmony, 
When I 
can take my lady love 
To the Opening Soiree ! 
For I 
dearly love. & c. 
My Beau in the Stationery Store. 
Words by JENNIE LINDSAY, the Popular Vocalist. 
Good evening to you. one and all. 
I 
hope to find you well; 
Just pay attention for a-while, 
And to you I 
will tell 
I'm feeling happier to-night 
Than I 
ever felt before ; 
The reason is, I 
have a 
Beau. 
In a 
down town Stationery Store. 
CHORUS. 
And he says he loves no one but me! 
What on earth can a 
fellow say more! 
And married I 
am soon going to be, 
To my Beau in the Stationery Store! 
He comes to see me twice a 
week, 
And takes me out to walk; 
He puts his arm around my waist, 
And of the future he does talk : 
But I 
tell him he is foolish, 
And to wait a 
few years more : 
For the young men's wages are so small 
In a 
down town Stationery Store! 
CHORUS. 
Still he swears he loves no one but me! 
What on earth can a 
fellow say more? 
And married I 
am soon going to be, 
To my Beau in the Stationery Store. 
What I 
Heard an Old Maid Say. 
As Sung by JENNIE LINDSAY. 
You men are all deceivers, 
I 
heard an Old Maid say, 
You tell us girls you love us, 
Then steal our heart's away ; 
Each night as I 
lay sleeping 
*Upon my little bed, 
I 
dream, and often do I 
think 
'Tis true, what the Old Maid said. 
Yes, the men are all deceivers, 
So, girls, of them beware! 
They kiss you and caress you, 
Try to catch you in their snare ; 
There is nothing so sweet as loving, 
But of deceitful men I 
am in dread ! 
So girls, do have sense and don't forget 
The words the Old Maid said.

THOSE ROGUISH EYES. 
As Sung by JENNIE LINDSAY. 
Now I've just come out to sing about 
A 
charming girl I 
met, 
The other day, while walking out; 
Her smile I 
can't forget--
Her style was most surpassing, 
Her face beamed like the skies! 
And my heart it is completely won, 
By the girl with the roguish eyes! 
Cuonus. 
So I 
hastened to her side, 
And as the time so quickly flies, 
I 
told her I 
was deep in love 
With her lovely roguish eyes! 
f. 
Now, slowly we walked on, 
Until she reached the gate ; 
She said that she must go. 
As the hour was growing late ; 
I 
asked her if she would meet me, 
When the Moon sank in the skies ? 
She answered Yes! and by the old oak tree 
I 
watch for those roguish eyes! 
So I 
hastened, Ace. 
Norah, be True to Your Barney. 
Words and Music by JEN= LINDSAY. 
Come smile once again, e'er we part, love. 
Say that you'll ever be true, 
For o'er the seas I 
must go love ; 
Still my poor heart is with you, 
And though absent, I 
love 
fa? better, 
And I'll dream of you, evc2y day ; 
'Yes, each week I 
will send you a 
letter, 
And for its quick answer fll pray. 
Car‘hicts. 
Arrah ! won't you be true to your Barney ? 
Won't you love me all the same— 
For I'd die for your sake, Norah, darling— 
And soon, love. I 
will change your name. 
The stars in the heavens shine bright, love, 
The birds sing their sweet lullaby; 
The night is rast fading away, love, 
And clouds gather o'er the blue sky; 
So now dry your tears Norah, darling, 
Remember the hour's growing late. 
One year from to-night Norah, darling, 
I 
will call you my own, at this gate. 
CHORUS. 
Arrah 
won't you be true to your Barney? 
Won't you love me all the same ? 
For 
die for your sake Norah, darling— 
And soon I 
will change your name. 
By JENNIE LINDSAY. 
Dedicated to the FLY AWAY CLUB. 
When I'm walking down the street, 
Dressed in style, I 
look so neat, 
And in the pink of fashion, down to my feet, 
I 
cut an awful clash. 
Or, when riding in the Park, 
With a 
gay and jolly spark, 
And a 
team of fast horses, bound for a 
lark, 
0, don't we spend the cash. 
East or West, wherever you may be, 
Girls like us ou seldom see ; 
Always happy, gay and free,

SHE IS THE PET OF THE SWELLS. 
By FRANI{ LAWLER. 
Dedicated to M ISS JENNIE LINDSAY. 
There is a 
circle of fine gents, 
And don't they envy me, 
For I'm in love with the sweetest girl 
That ever you did see ! 
She dresses in the fashion, too. 
She's the finest of all Belles. 
With chestnut hair and eyes of blue, 
She is the Pet of the Swells ! 
CHORUS.. 
She is the fairest of Belles, 
I 
love the toss of her curls : 
She is the sweetest of girls, 
My fair one. my Pet of the Swells! 
She is haughty and proud they all say, 
But that's just what I 
like the best; 
For she knows she's the Belle of Broadway, 
When she is in her prettiest dress'd ; 
Gents say that she is a 
coquette, 
And flirting's the fashion with Belles, 
But I 
know that they often regret, 
They can't talk to the Pet of the Swells! 
She is the fairest, & c, 
SWEET NORAH MAHONE, 
Respectfully dedicated to Miss Jennie Lindsay, 
By HARRY BENNETT. 
WILT thou meet me at evening, sweet Norah Mahone, 
When Luna has brightened the dell? 
Ah! come with the old-loving light in thine eyes, 
And words of affection I'll tell. 
0 
keep me not waiting thy coming, my love, 
I'm longin4 thy dear face to see; 
The round, laughing moon shines in splendor above, 
As if she were welcoming thee. 
CHORUS. 
Then say thou wilt meet me when stars they are bright 
0 
meet me, my jewel—my own ! 
I'm loving thee fondly, though far from thy sight, 
My darling, sweet Nora.h Mahone. 
0 
hie to me, love, ere the moonbeams have flown, 
And darkness o'ershadows the night, 
l've something to tell thee, sweet Norah Mahone— 
'Twill fill thee with joy and delight. 
Then hasten adown to the old wicket-gate, 
And there I'll be waiting for thee; 
The night is enchanting-0 
tarry not late! 
But quicken thy footsteps to me. 
Chorus.—Then say, & c.

Her mother was his early love, 
Her sire his boyhood's friend, 
And when they pass'd away, their child, 
The old man vow'd to t 
nd. 
She was the sunshine of his home, 
A 
rose so bright and fair, 
With all her mother's loving ways, 
Her eyes and golden hair, 
Her eyes and golden hair. 
What wonder to his lonely heart 
Crept back the love:of old, 
But autumn may not wed with spring, 
He cherished it untold ; 
But autumn may not wed with spring, 
He cherished it untold. 
One day there came a 
seemly knight, 
To woo her from his side, 
The old man smiled upon him, 
For her sake, his joy an I 
pride, 
His joy and pride. 
But fickle was the knight and false, 
(A story threadbare old.) 
He woo'd Ler for a 
lit le while, 
Then wed for lands and gold. 
A 
blighted flower can bloom no more, 
The old man wept one day, 
As murmuring the name she lov'd. 
His darling pass'd away,i 
ks murmuring the name she lov'd, 
His darling, his darling, his darling, pass'd away. 
WISH MAMMA WAS HERE, 
sung with immense applause by Alma. DAVIE.

And Willie murmured in his sleep,

The angel death was near him then. 
At early dawn he died.

And Willie breathed his last fond sigh,

I 
WANDERED BY THE BROOKSIDE 
Music Published by FIRTH, POND & 
Co., 547 Broadway, New York. 
I 
wandered by the brook-sid, 
I 
wandered by the mill— 
I 
could not hear the brook flow, 
The noisy wheel was still. 
There was no soum, of grasshopper, 
No chirp of any bird-
-,nd the beating of my own heart 
Was all the sound I 
heard, 
I 
sat beneath the Elm tree, 
I 
watched the long, long shade, 
And as it grew still longer. 
I 
did not feel afraid— 
For I 
listened for a 
footfall. 
I 
listened for a 
word. 
But the beating of my own heart, 
Was all the sound I 
heard. 
He came not, no, he came not 
The moon came out alone ; 
The little stars sat, one by one. 
Each on its golden throne. 
The evening wind passed by thy cheek, 
The leayes above were stirred. 
But the beating of my own heart 
Was all the sound I 
heard. 
Fast, newt tears were 1:dling. 
When something stc:od behind, 
A 
hand was on my shoulder, 
I 
knew the touch was kind : 
It drew me nearer, nearer, 
We could not swak a word 
And the beating of own heart. 
Was -,ouncl we heard.

How the little spark is shining, 
From whomever can it he ? 
It gets brighter still and brighter, 
Like a

For it drives suspense away.

Shed your beams on me; 
And speed the loving message,

Hope and fear alike perplex me, 
Oh superstitious dread, 
How many idle fancies, 
You conjure in my head; 
When 'those we love are absent. 
How wantonly you play; 
Every shadow seems a 
substance, 
And drives suspense away,

Then the darling messenger,

If this is only from the same. 
How welcome it shall be.

crossed the great big ocean, the Yankee folks to see. 
I've heard of great big wonders, but very few I've seen now, 
So if you'll wait, why I'll relate, the wonders which I've seen. 
Of the hills and dales so grand. that's seen in Paddy's land. 
The boys and girls of our dear Isle, so beautiful to see, 
Driving on a 
jaunting car, with Paddy by my side, 
When the moon is shining brightly, along the road we glide. 
There's a 
pretty place called Dublin, 
What can equal that great city, 
For learning and for excellence ot Erin's gallant sons, 
To the memory of departed worth, I'll spake of Dan

There's the " Dan-de

THE BIRTHDAY OF WASHINGTON. 
WHEN the sun's golden rays woke the morn into birth. 
Crowning earth's fairest beauties with glory and mirth, 
Strains of music the rarest caine floating along. 
And the voice of the nation joined in the glad song.

CHORUS. 
Then awake sons of freedom, blend your voices in one, 
And join in the praise of our loved Washington. 
Oh gay broke the light and sweet breathed the morn, 
On that glorious day when our hero was horn.. 
Then the angels bade each broken heart ectae to bleed, 
For God gave to our country a 
hero indeed. 
But that morning bath passed and his soul winged its flight, 
To the land of the blest in the regions of light, 
Yet the undying memories of that golden day, 
Play around the heart's altars and chant freedom's lay.

MY LOVE SHE IS A 
FAIRY QUEEN 
Sung by Miss AI.IciA JouRDAN. 
NIy love she is a 
fairy queen— 
About her face no paint is seen : 
Her pretty foot is very small, 
But very large is her waterfall ; 
Her ankle, too, so plump and fat, 
It makes my heart go pit-a-pat ; 
Were I 
a 
bee upon her lip, 
I'd stay all day and sip, and sip. 
Caw:us. 
Oh. she never flirts—she's no coquette : 
She never scolds, nor does she fret ; 
She's Lome on style, and full of fun : 
•• You bet your life, - she's number one. 
I 
took her to a 
show one night. 
I 
almost knew 'twould please her quite ; 
And as we sat in the paronette, 
How nice I 
felt I 
scarce can say ; 
The bell it rang. the curtain rose ; 
A 
man came out in spangled clothes. 
Entrancing me with dashing style. 
While to my love he gave a 
smile. 
Oh, she never ilirta tte. 
To see my love, next day I 
went— 
To pop the question was my intent; 
Alas I 
poor me, I 
felt quite sore 
To hear she'd gone in a 
coach and four 
Her mother squealed and I 
did squall ; 
She'd took her trunk and waterfall ; 
I 
seized my hat—to the show I 
ran. 
But she'd eloped with a 
circus man. 
Oh, she never flirts, &c.

Soon shall I 
hear yotr voices in merry childish glee, 
Proclaim the joyous welcome welcome home. 
The moon looks mildly down the same as oft before, 
And bathes the earth in floods of mellow light, 
But its beams are not so bright upon this lonely shore, 
As they seemed at home one year ago to night. 
Sadly my heart still turns to thee, 
Wherever I 
may chance to roam, 
hear your voices ringing in merry childish glee; 
Oh! I 
long to see the little ones at home. 
The little ones at home, etc. 
May guardian angels still their vigils o'er thee keep, 
May heaven's choicest blessings on thee rest, 
Till I 
am safely borne across the stormy deep, 
And meet again with those I 
love the best. 
Soon, soon your faces I 
shall see, 
Never, never more from thee to roam, 
soon shall I 
hear your voices in merry childish glee 
Proclaim the joyous welcome welcome home.

Too rough to fan her cheek:

In strange and childish sorrow, 
And whisper to himself the words,

He'd whisper to himself the words,

The Day When You'll Forget Me. 
Words by " MoRGAN." 
Music by J. 
R. 
TEIOM1S. 
As sung br-JENNIE Monoss. 
Music to be had of OLIVER DITSON & 
Co., Boston, Mass., Priee 400tr. 
You call me sweet and tender names, 
And softly smooth my tresses, 
And all the while my happy heart 
Beats time to your caresses. 
You love me in your tender way, 
I 
answer as you let me ; 
But ah! there comes another day, 
The day when you'll forget me, 
The day when you'll forget me. 
I 
know that ev'ry fleeting hour 
Is marked by thoughts I 
bring you, 
I 
know there dwells a 
subtle pow'r 
In the sweet songs I 
sing you. 
I 
do not fear the darkest way, 
With those dear arms about me, 
Ah no, I 
only dread the day 
When you can live without me, 
When you can live without me. 
And still you call me tender names, 
And softly smooth my tresses ; 
And still my happy answ'ring heart 
Beats time to your caresses. 
Hush! let me put that touch away, 
And clasp your hands above me; 
So while I 
ask to die that day, 
The day you will not love me. 
The day you will not love me. 
You need not check the thoughts that rise 
With darkness wrapt about them, 
For gazing in your earnest eyes, 
My heart can almost doubt them. 
Yet hush my whispers as you may, 
Such chidings do not fret me; 
Ah ! no, I 
only fear that day, 
The day when you'll forget me, 
The day when you'll forget me. 
ONLY BE KIND, 
As sung by Al./C0-1., BENNETT. 
Why turn away when I 
draw near? 
Why cold to-day? once I 
was dear; 
Then thy heart stirred and flushed thy brow; 
Never a 
word comes to me now— 
Now thy hand lies listless in mine ; 
Once its replies spake love divine ; 
Cold as if we never had met ; 
Can it then be hearts can forget? 
Cnoans. 
Speak to me, speak— 
Be my heart heard, or it will break, 
For one kind word; 
No vows to bind, no pledge I 
seek, 
Only be kind—speak to me, speak. 
One idle day thou did'st deplore 
Some castaway, on desert shore ; 
'Twas but a 
tale, by poet feigned, 
Yet thou did'st pale, silent and pained, 
And thou did'st moan—sad, sad to be 
Utterly lone, by the bleak sea; 
My life is drear, I, cast away--
Give me the tear thou shed'st that day. 
Speak to me, 4te.

Summer groves may lose their gladness ;

Roses underneath the snow !

May be severed here on earth ;

Thro' the Winter's gloomy dearth ! 
Cheerful hearts around us beating, 
Wearing ever Summer's glow, 
Ah ! we know you're always meeting— 
Roses underneath the snow 1.

Can forever leave us here!

RIDING in a 
street car the other day, 
Reading in the Herald to pass the time away, 
A 
darling little creature dressed in latest style, 
Took the seat I 
offered her, and thanked me with a 
smile, 
Eyes of brightest lustre, hair of glossy hue, 
Form so fair and slender, and so graceful too; 
How my heart went pit pat, I 
shall ne'ver forget, 
And the dear emotion lingers with me yet, 
CHORUS. 
It was riding in the street car just the other day 
Some one that I 
saw there stole my heart away 
Handsome form and feature just the one for me 
And if our love is inutual,happy we shall be. 
She's the charming fair one coming down the street, 
I 
wonder if she'll know me when we chance to meet, 
flow my heart 18 throbbing, tho' I 
must appear 
As if chance alone had made me linger here. 
Oh there's the charming fellow that stole my heart away, 
That gave me up his seat in the car the other day; 
How I 
wish he'd ask me for to take a 
walk, 
It would be enchanting could I 
hear him talk. 
It was riding, etc. 
Darling little creature, pardon me, I 
pray, 
But won't you go a 
walking to pass the time away, 
Well, really sir, I 
thank you, I 
can hardly choose, 
Still you're so engaging I 
will not refuse. 
Won't it be so pleasant just to have a 
walk, 
Yes, and so delightful just to have a 
talk; 
-I've a 
little secret to whisper in yorx ear, 
I'll agree to treasure ev'ry word I

And together we grow old,

Side by side, through storm and strife, 
Still together, hand in hand, 
Seek we now another land.

WALKING OUT ON SUNDAY, 
Sung with great success, by Miss CARRIE DUNCAN, at Tony 
Pastor's Theatre. 
Walking out on Sunday I 
think very nice 
'What I 
would dispense with, not at any price; 
So whe.n the weather's proper, I'm ready in a 
thricci 
To take my usual walk out on Sunday. 
A 
drive out in a " trap" now some folks seem to prize, 
But the exercise of walking I 
would much advise, 
And oh, such funny sights, and oh such horrid guys 
You meet with when you're walking out on Sunday. 
CHORUS. 
Walking out on Sunday in the afternoon, 
Crawling out on Sunday in the afternoon, 
Driving out on Sunday in the afternoon, 
It's awful jolly walking out on Sunday. 
Now there's Augustus Tompkins, a 
very heavy swell, 
He manages to live somewhere on Murray Hill, 
You'd take him for a 
banker or a 
broker down on Wall street, 
'When he crawls out to do his walk on Sunday, 
With his silver-headed cane, and a 
glass stuck in one eye 
He twirls his fine moustache, which suspicions looks of dye, 
In fact you seldom see, sc elegant a 
guy, 
As Tompkins when he's crawling out on Sunday. 
Walking out on Sunday in the afternoon. 
Yes, we'll Write you a 
Letter from Home. 
We'll write you a 
letter from home, 
To tell bow we're longing to hear 
The footsteps that nevermore come, 
The voice that to us was so dear 
For, oh I 
you are still, still the same, 
Through dark raging seas may divide; 
We sigh, when we hear your dear name. 
To 
welcome you back to our side. 
CHORUS. 
We'll write you a 
letter from home, 
We dream of you, darling, each night. 
We love you wherever you roam, 
We'll kiss every word that we write. 
We'll write you a 
letter from home, 
To bear you our love o'er the sea. 
To gladden your heart as you roam, 
And cheer you wherever you be. 
'Tis lonely while you are away; 
For sweet was the joy that you gave 
Oh I 
sadly we pine while you stray;

Underneath the sweet magnolia, now, remember what I "tole yer,” 
That's the place I 
met Miss Kitty Allalee, 
Where the sweet magnolia blossom, shed its petals on her bosom. 
And I 
had to brush them off so tenderly. 
But she seemed to half decline when I 
asked her to be mine; 
Then I 
pressed her closer to my loving breast, 
Till she said you may relent it. hasty weddings are repented, 
That was all sh^ raid. but you can guess the rest.

'YOU AM I" 
As sung by ALICE BENNETT. 
Words and Music by CLAREBEL. 
Music to be had W M. A. 
POND & Co., 547 Broadway N. I.., price aids. 
We sat by the river, you and I! 
In the .sweet summer time long ago. 
So smoothly the water glided by, 
Making music in its tranquil flow; 
We threw two leaflets, you and I, 
To the river, as it wander'd on, 
And one was rent and left to die, 
And the other floated forward all alone, 
And oh! we were saddea'd, you and I! 
For we felt that our youth's golden dream 
Might fade, and our lives be sever'd. soon, 
As the two leaves were parted in the stream! 
'Tis years since we parted, you and I! 
In that sweet summer time, long ago. 
And I 
smile as I 
pass the river by, 
And I 
gaze into the shadow depths below. 
I 
look on the grass and bending reeds, 
And I 
listen to the soothing song, 
And I 
envy the calm and happy life 
Of the river, as it sings and flows along, 
For oh! how its song brings back to me 
The shade of our youth's golden dream! 
In the days ere we parted, you and I, 
As the two leaves were parted in the stream 
It's Naughty But It's Nice. 
59 
As sung by Mis Jennie Hughes. 
There's lots of things you know, 
Wherever you may go, 
That we should never undertake to do, 
Although it charms the eye, 
We ought to pass it by, 
It would be better if we only knew. 
My Mother used to say, unto me every day, 
When you see a 
pie don't always want a 
slice, 
I 
used to go up stairs and take it unawares, 
All the while I 
knew ' twas naughty but ' twas nice. 
CHORUS. 
Oh 1 
it's naughty but it's nice, and we like it so, 
'Tis sure fellows do wrong to entice, 
No matter what you see, you never can agree, 
All the while you know its naughty but it's nice, you bet 
We go to see our girls, with lots of pretty curls, 
To pq:ss the time so pleasantly away, 
We praise the little dears, and drive away their fears, 
And such lots of sweet nonsence to them say., 
And when it's late at night, 
The stars are shining bright, 
To kiss them, why it gives to life a 
spice, 
Our arms around their wais ts, del ightfully are placed 
All the while we know it's naughty but it's nice.

American Fortune- Telling Cards.—This is the old-
est and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We ha-re 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arringed and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each or these into K for King. Q for Queen, 
and K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but th e di recti ons have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. 
Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-cornmittal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged an d 
enj oyed 
in the 
happiness of matrimony. This Pack of CArds will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

The N. Y. Evening Mail writes. 
"A 
Little Book has lately appehred in print at Mr. A. 
J. 
FISHIER'S, 98 Nas-
sau street called the " Little Flirt." We cannot say that we recommen& 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining " how, when and 
where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting. ," 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a 
neat Jae 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. 
J. 
FISHER, No. 98 Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might af-
ford sonic innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recant-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."
