My Johanna lives up in Harlem, 
Sunday nights, boys, sure I

Three long years her I've been a-courting, 
She's a

There's a

Hold the fort, fur I'm left behind," 
" 
Eilleen Allanna went on a

" 
For heaven's sake now pull down the blind!"

Said her daughter had shaken me, 
Then her mother condescended 
To throw me into the street, you see; 
Then Johanna shouted " Papa!" 
He fell upon me like a

I'll keep away from sweet Johanna, 
Sunday night, when the parlor's full.

Of Adam bold, 
While dozing on the grasses, 
Good luck, says he,

You bonny Irish lasses.

THE BOY FROM COUNTY CLARE,—CoscLunED. 
2. 
A 
neat colleen and sweet potheen 
Bedad ! 
I 
love the two, 
And to the both I 
took an oath 
And mean to keep it true. 
For when away too long I 
stay 
I 
sigh to think of that, 
And take a 
drain to stay the pain 
And warm the heart of Pat. 
Cllo:— For, to turn a 
stick, S:.c. 
3. 
Nell O'Grady is a 
lady 
Sweet as buttermilk, 
Although she wears no quality airs 
Nor yet the gown of silk. 
She has no hat, but what of that! 
And though her arms are bare 
She is a 
jade to suit a 
blade 
Like Pat from County Clare. 
Cito:—For, to turn a 
stick, S:c. 
4. 
I 
told my love I'd weep above 
I 
teapot full of tears, 
Unless she'd say she'd come my way 
And comfort Paddy's years. 
" 
I 
will" said she, and smothered me 
With kisses on the nose, 
"I'm fond of that" said " she that's flat" 
From old shillelagh blows. 
CHO :— For, to turn a 
stick, & c. 
5. 
So Paddy's life and Padd'ys wife 
Are both as bright as day. 
Not anywhere in County Clare 
Are two so blithe as they. 
With dance and song they jog along 
In fair and stormy weather, 
And when they die they mean to try 
And do so both together. 
Cuo:—For, to turn a 
stick, & c. 
Written by EDWARD HARRIGAN, and sung by him in his beauti-
ful sketch of " The Blue and the Gray." 
On the banks of the Potomac, 
I 
am lonely here to-night, 
Sure I'm waiting for the enemy 
To come out here and fight; 
Arrah, when this war is over, 
Oh, I 
will bless the day, 
Let me be dead or living, 
I'd praise America. 
But sure I 
can't help thinking 
Of the girl I 
left behind, 
A 
rosy Irish lassie, 
So loving and so kind; 
My dear old grey-haired mother, 
I 
left there all alone, 
I'd feel like young Napoleon, 
When I 
go marching home 
Oh, a 
soldier's life is tedious, 
When he's laying loose in camp, 
We never have excitement 
Unless we're on a 
tramp; 
A 
short life and a 
merry one, 
Is generally our lot, 
Till we get our life-long furlough, 
From the enemy's heavy shot. 
If a 
soldier's never kilt, 
Oh, he's smothered up in luck, 
Should he lose an ear or finger, 
Or be wid a 
bagnet struck; 
Ile can get a 
pair of crutches, 
From the doctor, it's well known, 
And feel like the Ring of Persia, 
When he goes marching home. 
Its a 
pleasure to the soldier, 
To look up in the skies, 
And see the stars a-blinking, 
Like a 
pair of roguish eyes; 
A-winking and a-twinkling, 
Jnst as if they'd say— 
You may kiss me if you catch me, 
Before I 
get away. 
For to hear the wind a-howling 
And moaning through the trees, 
It's enough to make you shiver, 
And tremble in the knees; 
But I 
must do my duty, 
If I 
petrify to stone, 
I'll feel like Julius Cwsar, 
When I 
go marching home.

COLLEGE DAYS. 
Words by EDWARD HARRIGAN. 
Music by G. W. H. GRIFFIN. 
Sung in EnwAllo HARRIGAN'S great play of " Old Lavender.* 
Oh many moons have passed and gone, 
Since first I 
went to school. 
At Harvard, dear old Harvard, friends, 
learned the Golden Rule; 
Nly classmates scattered here and there, 
All trod their different ways, 
love to think and ponder o'er 
My youthful college days. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
I 
remember when a 
Freshman there, 
My age just twenty-four, 
In the Yale and Harvard race, my friends, 
I 
always rowed stroke oar& 
Our CIIors—handsome scarlet bright— 
First led the van always, 
Admired by the ladies all, 
Was I 
in college days. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
Oh, tin' day when I 
did graduate, 
I. was my parents pride, 
Fitted for the bar or bench, 
A 
linguist, too, beside; 
Socially I'd always meet 
My colleagues bright and gay, 
And toss a 
merry social glass, 
To our commencement day. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
Culture and intelligence, 
Are qualities quite fine, 
They help constitute the gentleman, 
In every worldly clime; 
You may crush them down unto the ground, 
With poverty's cold ways, 
They'll rise again, assert their 
As taught in college days.

But soon I

They said I'd too much cheek;

They made a

From that they made me president 
Of our new Home Rule league,

To satisfy the Home Rule League, 
Then every one will say—

MY OWN EILEEN BAWL 
IRISH BALLAD. 
As sung by F,D. HARRIGAN at the Theatre Comique. 
Music Published by C. M. 
TREMAINE, N. 
Y. 
Price, 30 cents. 
My dear little Eileen is sweeter to me 
Than the ordorous flowers of the maythorn tree, 
She has hair golden fair, she has skin like a 
swan, 
Awl what shall I 
say to my own Eileen Bawn, 
And what shall I 
say to my own Eileen Bawn. 
My dear little Eileen has a 
heart full of love, 
And I 
scarce think of earth or of heaven above; 
But the grace of her face from the night to the dawn, 
And what shall I 
say to my own Eileen Bawn, 
And what shall I 
say to my own Eileen Bawn. 
I 
think she's an angel that dropped on the earth, 
With her soft sunny smiles and her sweet laugh of mirth; 
And I've oft thoughts of fear that she'll sometimes be gone, 
And what shall I 
say to my own Eileen Bawn, 
And what shall I 
say to my own Eileen Bawn. 
I'll meet her next Sunday by fair Avondhu, 
When I'll ask her to love me and marry me, too; 
And rove in the grove till the twilight comes on, 
And that's what I'll say to my own Eileen Bawn, 
And that's what I'll say to my own Eileen Bawn, 
Written by J. T. TUTR. Sung by GRIFFIN, the double-back song 
and dance artist. 
Oh, I 
was young and handsome once, 
But now my youth has fled, 
Old age has almost turned quite grey 
The wool upon my head; 
But yet I 
laugh and dance and sing, 
Wherever I 
may go, 
To twirl these boots this child it suits, 
And they call me Old Black Snow. 
But yet I 
laugh and dance and sing, 
Wherever I 
may go; 
To twirl these boots this child it suits, 
And they call me Old Black Snow. 
(Dance.) 
I've got no home, I 
love to roam, 
I'm welcome everywhere, 
The girls they sigh as I 
go by, 
And don't the darkies stare; 
And when I 
cut my capers, 
On my light fantastic toe, 
They open their eyes in great surprise, 
To see this Old Black Snow, 
CHORUS. 
Awl when I 
cut my capers, 
On my light fantastic toe; 
They open their eyes in great surprise, 
To see this Old Black Snow. 
(Dance.) 
I 
never stop, I'm on the hop, 
I 
go from place to place, 
And as I'm told, both young and old, 
They're glad to see this face; 
For I 
laugh and sing both night and day, 
And twist my bluchers so, 
There's not a

THE RUSTIC "YOUNG DAMSEL. 
ig 
Written and composed by HARRY LISTON. 
Sung by W ILL 
MARTIN, of Harrigan & Hart's Theatre. 
A long time ago, I 
remember it well, 
In a 
beautiful village a 
damsel did dwell : 
Alone with her parents she lived all serene, 
Her age it was red, and her hair was nineteen. 
SPOKEN—Yes, she was a 
generous girl ; she supported plain 
needlework :by taking in her poor old father. 
She was called— 
CHORUS. 
A sweet rustic damsel with cheeks like the rose, 
A roman shaped eye, and a 
cast in her nose. 
Now she had a 
lovier who close by did dwell, 
A bandy backed rustic, and hump legged as well; 
Said he, " Fly with me, by the light of you star, 
For you are the eye of my apple, you are." 
SPOKEN—He was poor, but he was honest; and many an 
honest coat beats beneath a 
ragged heart, and he loved 
A sweet rustic damsel, etc. 
But this dutiful maiden said gently, " Be wise; 
My father would scratch out my nails with his eyes. 
If you love me you will not bring me to disgrace," 
Sobbed the maid as she buried her hands in her face. 
SPOKEN—It was an affecting scene, and the light of a 
cloud 
suddenly bursting from behind the moon, fully revealed the at-
titude of 
So, as she refused him, he knocked down the maid, 
Then silently opened the knife of his blade; 
Ho next cut the throat of this damsel so fair, 
Then dragged her along by the head of her hair, 
SPOKEN—It was all her own hair; she never descended to 
false chignons, but she was dead now. 
Yes, her throat was 
cut from mouth to mouth, and the water rushed forth from the 
wound like blood. 
A sweet rustic damsel, etc. 
Just then her old father came up, it appears, 
And looked on this sad sight with eyes in his tears; 
He knelt by her side and her sweet face lie kiss'd, 
Then rushed with his nose at the murderer's fist. 
SPOKEN— Poor old man 
He had put his head on his hat, 
and come out in search of his absent daughter. and had just 
stopped to strike his pipe against a 
match, when he saw the 
dead body of 
A charming little rustic, etc. 
With the knife the old man he an end to him put 
Then spurned with his body the murderer's foot; 
To commit suicide then his way he did wend. 
So that is the tale of a 
very sad end. 
SPOKEN—Poor old man! 
His was the fate to be lamented, 
cut off in the flower of his youth, 
In the bloom of womanhood 
• 
she plied. 
Her memory was short, but her life is still revered 
by those who knew 
A sweet rustic damsel, etc.

RAMBLING BY THE STREAMS 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Sung by G. W. GRIFFIN and MART. HANLEY, champion 
athletic song and dance artists. 
A 
ramble by the stream is so delightful, 
On a 
lovely summer's day, 
When the pretty birds are singing to their heightful, 
Ar421 flowers are blooming gay; 
Upon the banks reclining, 
Beside a 
maiden fair, 
And pretty posies twining, 
To deck her silken hair, 
And then a 
little ramble by the streamlet, 
Beneath the shady trees, 
So pleasantly refreshed by 
The summer's welcome breeze. 
CHORUS. 
When on the banks reclining, 
I'm pretty posies twining, 
To give while rambling with my little treasure. 
It's like a 
blissful dream. 
Oh, what could bring more pleasure, 
Than rambling by the stream. 
My pretty little treasure's name is Nora, 
She dwells beside the stream, 
And I 
shall ne'er forget when first I 
saw her, 
For I 
confused did seem, 
I 
As I 
strolled through the garden, 
I 
unto her did say— 
I 
humbly ask your pardon, 
For trespassing this way. 
She blushed beneath her pretty little sunshade, 
Where underneath was seen, 
A 
smile when I 
at at once said— 
Come ramble by the stream. 
When on the banks, etc. 
To stroll beside the streamlet she consented, 
'Twas then I 
did perceive 
A 
chance for me, so I 
at once presented 
My suit to her that eve ; 
For her reply I 
waited, 
As anxious as could be, 
And then she hesitated, 
And said don't bother me. 
But now for life she is my darling little treasure, 
So happy does she seem, 
Now what time we've at leisure, 
We're rambling by the stream. 
When on the banks, etc.

We are very often told, 
All that glitters is not gold;

Old ladies oft declares 
Girls should never wear false hair, 
The locks that once adorned another she, 
Or to use that lily-white; 
But they draw the curtains tight, 
And use it on the strict " Q. T." 
Oh, my! etc. 
With a

And you ask her to take wine, 
She says " I

Say " Mum's the word," make haste! 
And I

That " mum ' upon the strict " Q. T." 
Oh, my! etc. 
.Just take a 
pretty miss, 
And offer her a

When there's anybody standing by, to see. 
She'd say she'd rather die, 
But you may snatch it on the sly, 
And she'll like it on the strict " Q. T."

The Russians in the East,

Rine cannot do without it, all agree, 
And her pretty little nose she'll powder, 
When a

To do it on the strict " Q. T." 
Oh, my! etc. 
When Sunday comes you fear, 
You can not get your beer, 
It's forbidden in the city of the free, 
It's naughty, but its nice, 
But if you ask for " Weiss," 
You'll get, in on the strict " Q. T." 
Oh, my! etc. 
Now, there's the needy swell, 
Who calls a

Wears an Ulster quite a

Then comes the ancient beau, 
Upon whose cheek there is a 
glow, 
That we think is on the strict " Q. T." 
Oh, my 1

Will you love me when I'm old? 
It is this that I

Will you love me when fin old.

If you'll love me when I'll old ? 
Down the stream of time togetner, 
We are sailing side by side; 
Hoping some bright day to anchor. 
Safe beyond Lhe urging tide. 
'To-day our sky is cloudless, 
But the night may clouds unfold; 
And its storms may gather round us,— 
Will you love me when I'm old? 
And its storms may gather round us,— 
Will you love we when I'm old? 
Life's morn, Ice. 
When my hair shall shame the snow-drift, 
And mine eyes shall dimmer grow;

In the valley as I

promise, 
Worth to me a 
world of gold;

That you'll love me when I'm old?

Some folks will cry " Oh ! shame, Mrs. Jones, you are to blame, 
I 
never should have thought it, ma'am, of you," 
While, if they'd look at home before abroad they'd roam, 
I'm positive they'd have enough to do. 
Mrs. Brown says it's a 
sin, that Mrs. Smith drinks gin, 
And harbors " tally:men " from day to day; 
While Mrs. Green was caught doing what she hadn't ought, 
When she in self defencs was heard to say— 
CHORUS. 
" 
They all do it, they all do it, 
They all do it, though ofttimes they rue it; 
Yet they all do it, they all do it, 
And so it will continue to the end of the world!" 
For hours three or four, lovers 'pooling at the door, 
On any moonlight evening may be seen; 
Though if they want a 
lark, they have it in the dark, 
And they " do it," though they say " they didn't mean," 
When creeping down the stairs, comes the old man unawares, 
And kissing catch the couple in the act; 
The mother, from above, says " Don't interfere, my love, 
You can't dispute this most important fact—" 
They all do it, etc. 
Old women do declare, girls should never dye their hair, 
And then again they say it's very wrong; 
Without the least restraint, their faces so to paint, 
And rob the easy chair for their chignon. 
Each girl a 
little puff, has inside a 
little muff, 
They are never seen without it, night or day; 
And her pretty nose she'll powder, if a 
moment is allowed her, 
When, if you laugh, she'll innocently say— 
They all do it, etc, 
tut what does most impress, is the style in which they dress, 
It's enough to make you laugh when them you see; 
They've a 
hat upon their heads, large enough to make up beds, 
For pussy cats with kittens two or three. 
In their panniers, too, behind, if examined you would find, 
The most important papers of the day; 
The Chronicle and Chimes, the Telegraph and Times, 
Or anything that chance puts in their way. 
They all do it, etc. 
There's my neighbor, Dinah Down, brught two lovely boys to 
town, 
And her husband gets but one pound one per week; 
You often hear him say, " If things go on this way, 
We'll a 
lodging in the Union have to seek! 
For the doctor and the nurse, will drain my scanty purse, 
With many more expenses to defray;" 
Then he gets into a 
passion, when they tell him " it's the 
fashion," 
And they soothe him as they sing this truthful lay— 
They all do it, etc.

Sung by J. W. GRIFFEN, with fourteen encores. 
The white apple blossoms are falling in showers, 
The rose bushes bloom in the sweet summer air; 
Enjoying the calm of the bright sunny hours, 
Grandmothsr sits in her old easy-chair. 
She reads in her Bible of cities fair, 
Whose walls are of jasper and gold, 
And waits for the angels to carry her there— 
Don't leave poor Grandmother, now she is old 
CHORUS. 
Don't leave poor grandmother, now she's old, 
White silver locks now have displaced the gold. 
Don't leave poor grandmother, now she's old, 
White silvered locks have now displaced the gold. 
Alt! well we remember when poor mother (lied, 
They laid her to rest where the green willows wave, 
How grandmother comforted us when we cried, 
Tenderly led us away from the grave. 
How patient, and gentle, and kind she's been, 
Her love for us ne'er can be told ; 
Oh, may her life's evening be calm and serene, 
Don't leave poor grandmother, now she is old. 
Don't leave, etc. 
The old village school-house that stands on the hill, 
The quiet village churchyard where tall grasses grow; 
The swift running stream near the old water mill, 
Bring back the memiries of long, long ago. 
These may be forgotten, but grandmother's care, 
Her tenderness, richer than gold, 
Shall ne'er be forgotten, our home she shall share, 
We'll not leave grandmother, now she is old. 
Don't leave, etc.

With beaming smile our time beguile,

In the golden rays its shadow it will mock you,

And darkness claims her right, 
We'll go to rest, and the blest,

Good evening to you, gents and ladies, 
We've come here to make a 
call, 
Descendants of the great O'Gradys, 
The best you'll find in Donegal. 
A 
year ago we took the notion 
To sail across the briny deep. 
The sea was in a 
great commotion, 
We could not get a 
wink of sleep. 
CFIORUS. 
They call us now the great O'Gradys, 
We'll fight till we're pushed to the wall, 
The young folks they were all a 
crying, 
The day we left ould Donegal. 
We were known throughout the country; 
The devil the one with us could dance, 
We were the first in every motion, and drink 
Whenever we had the chance. 
We used to drive the girls all crazy, 
So nimbly we could shake our feet; 
They never found us slow or lazy, 
At dancing we could not be beat. 
They call us, etc.

Oh! one evening lately, I 
dressed up nately, 
I 
put on my Sunday clothes, plug- hat and all; 
And I 
started proudly, while whistling loudly, 
For Neal Brogan's raffle at Hibernia Hall. 
Going round a 
corner, a 
gang of rowdies 
Oh! I 
know they're rowdies for they never work, 
Says, let give this ould Tad a 
racket, 
We will have a 
pic-nic, boys, and toss the Turk. 
CHORUS. 
Now I'm not a 
fighter, nor yet a 
biter. 
But when duty calls me I 
never shirk; 
So I'll tell you plainly, tho' I 
look ungainly, 
That they had no pie-nic when they toss'd the Turk. 
Oh! the big ring-leader, a 
free lunch raider, 
Says, " O'Brien you had better paint the ' tile,' 
Put crape around it, get an axe and pound it 1" 
And he thought ' twas funny when the gang did smile. 
It was then my dander rose like a 
gander, 
For T 
heard one loafer say he'd flash a 
dirk; 
So I 
tapp'd him lightly, arid surprised him finitely, 
And they had no plc-nic when they tossd the Turk. 
Now I'm not, etc. 
Oh! they gather'd round me, and thought to pound me, 
But I 
put my back against a 
big brick wall; 
You can't go behind me, says I, now mind me, 
If you stand forenint me I 
can bate ye all. 
Ther-the gang did face me and thought to lace me, 
13 ,it I 
showed them tricks I 
learned at Donegal; 
Right and left I 
pounded, they were dumbfounded, 
And at last for mercy they began to bawl. 
Spoken after 3d verse.—' Well, they looked surprised, and 
'Red Handed Mike' says, ' Who are you? 
Well, says 1, my 
name is Cornelius Thomas Francis Meagher O'Brien, and,

My golden-hair'd darlings, disturb not their rest, 
Sweet Angels have lull'd them to sleep on my breast; 
O'er their calm slumbers a 
vigil they keep. 
My babes feel no hunger while buried in sleep. 
Whene'er they awake, my fond heart, in its dread, 
Grows sick in the fear that I 
cannot find bread 
To give to my dear ones, so please let thorn rest; 
While Angels are watching them, slumber is best, 
Citonus. 
Tread softly, speak lightly, disturb not their rest, 
While Angels are guarding them, slumber is best. 
Hunger is bitter, while slumber is sweet, 
Wake not my darlings, they've nothing to eat. 
Lull them to rest! lull them to rest! 
Lull them to rest! lull them to rest! 
They say there is plenty and peace in the land, 
And that charity gives with a 
lavishing hand; 
Notwithstanding that church spires point to the skies, 
Wealth fattens on plenty, while poverty dies! 
There's one, by whose aid the sparrows are fed, 
And I've prayed unto him for our daily bread; 
I 
feel that I'm going my Saviour to meet, 
Where I'll not see my darlings want something to eat! 
Tread softly, etc.

THE COAL HEAVERS,

As originally sung by the Inimitable " Bards of Tara," KELLY 
4; RYAN, at all the 
principal Theatres throughout tile 
country with tremendous applarse. 
We've shoveled coal since early mo7n, 
Now for our boarding house we're bent ; 
One dollar a 
day is what they pay, 
Troth that's divilish easy spent. 
In a 
great big ship down here in the dock, 
That's filled from top to boom RitIi coal, 
It's there every morning we do llock, 
And shovel all day down in the hole. 
OltUS. 
Shoveling coal now that's our business, 
Every night it's borne w,i stroll, 
We're full of fun, anal sometimes whiskey, 
Hurrah for the lads that shovel the coal. 
We wish the times would only get better, 
So all could work throug,liout, the land ; 
How many poor men now are starving, 
While the rich in luxury li%-es so grand. 
If we were rti!ers of the tTuited States, 
We'd take a 
very Cotrerent plan, 
We'd make all rich maid rascals work, 
And give their place to the laboring man.

We're a

We buy up what e're we can find, 
We work hard at on- occupation, 
In picking up junk ot all kind. 
From the Jou ould. green land of shamrock 
A few years ago we came out. 
As partners we started this business, 
And from morning ' till night we do shout 
CnoRus. 
Any old rags, 
(Symph.) 
Any old bottles, (Symph.) 
Any old rags to put in our bags, 
have ye any old rags or bottles to-day. 
When we landed with only two shillings. 
We was told by a 
loafer named Burke 
To go to it Bladder refinery, 
And the boss he would put us to work. 
Faith we soon found out all their queer tricks, 
There jokes, their stalls and their gags, 
So we put the two shillings together, 
And started at bottles and rags. 
Any old rags, 
Now before we leave we MIMI, tell you 
That we love to deal honestly. 
So if ye have old rags or bottles. 
We'll come buy them all do you see; 
For all kinds of rags whatsoever. 
We'll pay the best price that is out. 
We'll come with our cow-bells a 
ringing. 
And at the top of our voice we will shout— 
Any old rags,

We eat hot clams and fry's of lambs--

Across the Atlantic Sea, 
Had arguments—of consequence 
I'm all broke up to day. 
I

With 141baloney's brother Jack ;

When I'm laid away in my grave, 
When my spirit has gone to heaven above, 
To him who my soul will save. 
When you are happy and gay once more, 
Thinking of the days that have been, 
There's one little wish I 
ask of you, 
See that my grave's kept green. 
Oh, the days will come to you, darling, 
When on earth no more 
be seen, 
One sweet little wish, darling, grant me, 
See that my grave's kept green. 
Will you keep me, love in remembrance, 
When the voice of chiding is heard, 
When other's may speak in censure or blame, 
Speak not one unkindly word.

Then we march'd down to supper 
In 'ristocratic style,

Would reach an Irish mile; 
The company assembled 
Were the pride of our city, 
The solid men from ev'ry ward, 
Were at Higgins' Coterie. —Ref.

The '

Were paraded in the papers, 
From Higgins' Coterie.—Ref

There was Burns, the big distiller, 
M'c Bride, the alderman, 
And a

All the wealth was represented' 
At Higgin's Coterie.—Rej:

At six o'clock next morning, 
The band played " Patrick's day," 
In horse-cars and in stages, 
The crowd all went away;

And kill'd his 
lie's living on free lunches 
Since he gave the Coterie.—Ref

GOD HELP OUR SUFFERING POOR, 
Written and sung by W ILL. H. 
MORTON with HARRIG'AN St 
HART'S Combination. 
While the sad cry of hard times resound through our land 
Do we give enough thought to the poor; 
Are we one and all ready to lend helping hand, 
To drive the grim wolf from the door. 
The selfish may think that kind fortune has dealt, 
With them and their own to secure 
The comforts and blessings that money can bring, 
But God help our suffering poor. 
There are plenty we meet who could help if they would, 
But the fact is their money's all spent; 
They're too poor themselves, or they ain't in the mood, 
Or some other excuse they'll invent. 
But ask you rich banker how much in his vaults 
These men have placed there to secure; 
And he'll tell you, if honest, their assertions are false, 
They could help our suffering poor. 
Can any one tell why those seeking for aid 
Always pass millionaires with distrust? 
Can it be solemn truth, what I've often heard said, 
That the rich seldom give e'en a 
crust? 
But there's the mechanic and laboring man, 
Ever ready to share his small store, 
For nearly each one knows how ' tis himself, 
God bless these true friends to the poor.

THE WATER MILL. 
A Poem recited by Gus W LLIAMS. 
Listen to the water- mill, all the livelong day, 
How the creaking of the wheel wears the hours away; 
Languidly the water glides—ceaseless on and still— 
Never coming back again to that water-mill. 
And the proverb haunts my mind, as the speli is cast— 
The mill will never grind again with the water that has passed. 
6 
r 
Take the lesson to yourself, loving hearts and true, 
Golden years are passing by, youth is passing, too; 
Try to make the most of life, loso no honest way, 
All that you can call your own lies in this—to- day. 
Power, intellect and strength may not, cannot last, 
The mill will never grind again with Cie VzIer that has passed. 
Oh, the wasted hours of life that have fleeted by, 
Oh, the good we might have done, lo.t without a 
sigh; 
Love that once we might have saved with but a 
single word, 
Thoughts conceived, but not expressed—perishing unheard. 
Take the lesson to your heart, take, oh I 
hold it fast, 
The mill will never grind again with the water that has passed. 
As sung by ALICE BENNETT. 
(These were the last words of " Americus," the well-known child 
violinist, seven years of age, who expired very suddenly during the 
night of January 10th, 1874, in Boston. 
So quietly did his spirit 
take its flight that his father, who occupied the same room, although 
hearing his son make the foregoing exclamation, thought the boy 
-as talking in his sleep, and was horrified to find the little child 
cold iu death, in the morning.)

" 
Good-night, father !" said our darling, 
As he sank to sweet repose; 
Like a 
bird his gleeful music, 
Died away at twilight's close : 
And a 
smile came o'er his features, 
Radiant with holy joy, 
As if angels came to whisper 
Tidings to our little boy. 
"Good-night, father !" said our darling, 
As he sank to sweet repose ; 
Like a 
bird his gleeful music, 
Died away at twilight's close. 
CHORUS. 
a` Good-night, father r said our darling. 
As he sank to sweet repose; 
Like a 
bird his gleeful music, 
Died at, died at twilight's close 
When night draped hcr sable curtain, 
flanging folds upon each star, 
Came a 
halo soft and lustrous, 
Streaming e'er the window bar: 
And we heard our darling murmur, 
As the brightness lit his face, 
"Please God, make me room in Heaven, 
Make your little boy a 
place !" 
" 
Good-night, father !" said our darling, 
As he sank to sweet repose ; 
Like a 
bird, his gleeful music 
Died away at twilight's close. 
He was weary of the struggle, 
Discords jarred upon his soul; 
And his gentle spirit left RS, 
Wafted to the heavenly goal; 
He has room among the angels, 
He is freed from sin and care: 
God, who watcheth e'en the sparrow, 
Answer'd little Jimmie's prayer. 
'Good-night, father !" said our darling. 
As he sank to sweet repose; 
Like a 
bird, his gleeful music 
Died away at twilight's close.

I'm as happy as the day is long, 
My mind is never easy, 
No matter whether right or wrong, 
You must not think me rude. 
For love it is the burden of my song, 
With joy I'm almost crazy; 
And if perchance I 
sing or dance, 
You must not think me rude, 
And if I 
make one little break, 
I 
hope I 
don't intrude. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, dear, don't you wish that you was me, (sym.) 
I 
feel just as happy as a 
big bumble-bee, 
(

I 
was walking by her door, 
When I 
heard the music sweet. 
And my heart with joy filled over, 
I 
couldn't keep my feet. 
So keep the music ringing, 
For it makes me feel so good; 
And if, perchance, I 
sing or dance, 
You must not think me rude. 
And if I 
make one little break-, 
I 
hope I 
don't intrude. 
(Dance.) 
At a 
fancy ball the other night, 
Myself and little Daisy, 
We kept it up till broad daylight, 
We felt so awful good. 
Oh, Daisy looked so fair and bright, 
Shc set the men all crazy; 
And if they asked her tor to dance, 
She'd ask me ii she could, 
And then I'd say in a 
careleq:a way— 
I 
hope I 
uon't intrude. 
Oh, dear, etc.

II AT legions of friends always bless us, 
When golden success gilds our way, 
How they smile as they softly address us, 
So cordial, good humored and gay. 
But oh if the sun of prosperity 
Has set, then how quickly they frown, 
And cry out in tones of severity, 
Kick the man don't you see that he's down. 
Then let all your dealings be honest and true, 
And do unto others as you'd have them to do, 
Sickness and sorrow may yet come to you, 
So lift up a 
man when he's down. 
What then if you had not a 
sorrow, 
Your heart was as open as day, 
Your friends when they wanted to borrow, 
You'd oblige and ne'er ask them to pay, 
But when if a 
friend you ne'er slighted, 
You wander about through the town, 
This friend becomes very near sighted, 
And don't seem to kriow you when down. 
Then let all, 1Lc. 
Then give me the heart that forever, 
Is free from the worlds selfish rust, 
And the man whose high noble endeavor, 
Is to raise fallen men 
om the dust, 
And when in adversity's ocean, 
A victim is likely to drown, 
All hail to the man whose devotion, 
Will lift up this man when he's down. 
Then let all, kc.
