[Louise Erdrich reads “Advice to Myself”] 
 
Louise Erdrich:  I wrote this poem for myself as a single mother. After my children would go to 
school, I would need some sort of guidance in how to get past the folding of the laundry, the 
cleaning of the refrigerator, the dishes, the rolls of dust coming up under the surfaces—all of 
those things. I had to get past them. I had to sit down and focus. I didn’t have much time. 
 
So, this poem was written as a help—as a helper for myself. I offer it here for anyone who 
needs a similar sort of reference. Something that will get you past all the things that need to be 
done, that don’t really need to be done, right now. Get you past, get you to your real, true task 
in life, which is to be more aware. To be in touch with the great movements of the universe. To 
be in touch with the sacred. With the profound. With the idiotic. With the sensual. 
 
Here it is, “leave the dishes.”
