WDS #0026 <unintelligible text> Male 19 10th grade (R.F.) START 58 B(9)
FW Okay, do you remember what kind of games you used to play when you were a kid?
INF Yes. Hide and go seek, stuff like kick ball, baseball, football, eat the peg, let me see
now... that's a that's a game played with a sharp object such as a screw driver or a knife
and you would ah it was a sort of around the world game; <gap> You would start at one
point sticking the screw driver into the ground. If you failed to stick the screwdiver into the
ground then it was other person's turn and he would from his ah ... and throw it into the
ground. Throw it on the shoulder, knee, foot, head, chin, or what have you. The first one
who completed the game, well, the other one would eat the peg other words they would ah
stick the screw driver up -- as far down in the ground as it would go and he would try to get
it out with his teeth. And that way he would eat the peg.
FW How did you play hide and seek?
INF Hide and seek you would select a candidate he select a candidate to cover himself by
placing his forearms over his eyes and ah against a lamp post, up against a lamp post and
all the others would run and hide.
FW How did you pick the guy to be it?

INT It was a hot potato thing, you know. Yeah, you know you put your all your all everyone
in the game would put their hands together you know, one on top the other and they would
sing hot potato hot potato. I forget the lyrics behind it you know, it was this sort of thing.
The lastone out would be it and it be the candidate for you know covering his face.
FW How did you get out of it, how did a person get out of it.
INF Well ah it varied see. It was hot potato hot potato. I just can't get the rest of it. Anyway
it would go all the way around and wherever it stopped, he eliminated. All around each
candidate 'til you
#0026 p.2
get to the last one. The last one was it automatically.
FW How does it work when they find you?
INF When he findsyou right, when he finds one of them. Everyone is hiding. When he finds
one then he would try to make it back to the base which would be the lamp post, the tree,
what have you before the other guy touches the thing. He would try to touch the lamp post
or the base before the other kid did. Which one <gap> you know touch first if the other guy
touch first then he would be say free. But if the person who was it touched first then the
other person was a dandidate for being it.
FW Oh. What about kick ball?

INF Kick ball. You select a team-- we had very large teams, sometimes has much as
nine, ten, eleven guys. Most of the ti e, I was a pretty big kid, and most kids my age were
rather small and I use to take a few gyys against maybe twice the number of my team
when we played simply because they did say I was a little large <gap> little smaller, so the
opposite team would get the field you do this by flipping a coin most of the time you know
or selecting a candidate from each side to race another, the other, whoever would win
you know they would say who would be out in the field and who would be up you know.
Anyway, the opposing team would be in the field while the other team would be ready
to kick. We would form a semi-formal line, you know, one right behind the other. Okay
you had something like a pitcher, some one at first base, no no wait a minute. A pitcher,
everyone else was in the outfield to catch the ball. If the pitcher, if the pitcher pitched the
ball you had three chances to kick it, okay, you have three fouls and you're out. That's the
way we played it. We made up our own rules you know and if he pictched the ball and it
was kicked <unintelligible text> by the <unintelligible text> ball -- a fly pop and someone
caught it then you're out and if the other person had changed bases if by any chance he
was on a base --he didn't get back to the same base then he would be out because we
would throw the ball at him. And if it touchedhim he would be out. if it didn't he was safe.
As long as he got away
#0026 p. 3
from the ball. It was something like dodge ball.
FW Do you watch TV very much?
INF I used to when I was kid, I don't have too much time to watch TV any more.

that time. I just hated them you know. The commercials. The humorous humorous ones

Phyllis Dillwr you know. Well I used to watch Hawaiian Eye. Sky King. Humptey Dumpty.
Buster Brown.
FW Oldies.

FW Do you remember a TV program that you saw recently that youcould tell me the story
of?

INF Sure, it was about a a black teacher in France teaching predominantly white kids or
French kids you know, light complexion, and ah they gave him a rough time and he started
out being anice guy. Even staff, even staff memsbers gave him a rough time and he tried
to get along with his class because he had rough rough necks, even girls but he managed
to get through to them you know. Stop them from jabbing around, playing in class, to learn,
you know something. And he conducted some projects you know, strategy and he used
it. I think he did pretty well. At the end one of his students <unintelligible text> gave him a
very rough time I think
#0026 p.4
they had a boxing match. He was a rough guy you know. He was a white kid. Big for his
age like I said, you know. like I was. The rest of the class looked up to him as being. you
know, rough guy or leader and he would give him such a rough time so one day they
almost got into a pushing match and so the next period I think he had to teach in gym.
He had to take them to gym you know -- teach them some gymnastics. While he was in
gym they were boxing. Everyone wanted to box. He had to teach them how to box. These
guys already knew how to box. Most of them better than he. Anyway the biggest one said
well why don't you box me <unintelligible text> Everyone <unintelligible text> helped it
you know the situation you know by yeah come on see you all box and they were boxing
together and the guy gave him a rough time a really tough time as a matter of fact he
was almost at the point where I where Ithought he was going to lose you know until he
managed to slip a lucky onein. Hitting the kid in the stomach. Knocking his breath out you
know. He was gagging and gasping for <gap> air for about an hour even when they went
back to class and so then after that after he got through to him this girl, the leader of the
girls, everything cooled down and the kids really learned. He was <unintelligible text> by
the faculty, some members. Some were still predjudiced. I think he did a pretty good job
and the picture was very nice. As a matter of fact I recommend it.
