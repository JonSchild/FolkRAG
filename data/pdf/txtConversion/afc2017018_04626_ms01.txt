I: 
All right. Are you good? 
I2: 
Yeah. Oh, yeah. I’m good. Yup. 
I: 
All right. We’re gonna get started, M, and the first thing I want to do is say thank you to you for agreeing 
to this interview, and also thank you for the work that you do as a caregiver ‘cause we believe it’s really super 
valuable, and we’re hoping to let the world know how valuable it is through these stories and photographs. So, 
we’re going to start right at the beginning, and you bring a different perspective to this because you are a 
family caregiver. All of the other personal care workers that we’ve been interviewing, except for E, have not 
been family caregivers. And I know that being a family caregiver does bring a different perspective to it. So, 
we’re happy to be getting this perspective, but let’s start at the beginning and tell us a little bit about your 
history as a caregiver. I know that you’ve been doing that for a number of years for different people. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And, right now, you’re doing it for Ma, but also for your husband’s father who lives here with you. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, just tell us your story—your caregiving story? 
P: 
Okay. I began caring for my father-in-law after his wife passed away. He’d been living in Memphis for 
nearly 40 years, and we invited him to live with us. And he’s been here for 8 years, and it’s been going pretty 
well. [Laughing] I’m sure as well as can be expected. He is 87 years old, but he still gets around quite well. He 
drives and is pretty independent. We just make sure he comes home every night, and that he’s well fed 
[1.16.54]. And about 2 years ago I began helping my cousin take care of her elderly father, and he’s in his mid-
80s. And then about a year and a half ago my husband’s mother and her husband were unable to stay at their 
family home any longer, so we relocated then next door to us. 
I: 
So, they live next door now? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
--to this home? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And are you providing care as well? 
P: 
Yes. My mother-in-law is diagnosed with Alzheimer’s [cries]. 
I: 
That’s all right. 
P: 
[Crying] so, she needs 24-hour care. Her husband is 83. He gets around pretty good. He still drives, 
and he’ll take her out to dinner or breakfast occasionally, but I think because of his mobility he tends to get 
himself into trouble [laugh/cries]. For example, yesterday he was cutting the grass, and—had his riding lawn 
mower on cruise. He crashed. [Crying] thank, God, he’s okay. 
I: 
This is your mother-in-law’s husband? 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
That lives next door? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And he is okay?

P: 
Yeah. He’s okay. He doesn’t think I know [laugh/cries]. I wasn’t here when it happened, and apparently, 
he swore the family to secrecy, so I just pretend I don’t know and it works out better for him [1.14.38] 
[laugh/cries]. 
I: 
You know, one of the things about—I’m guessing, I’m making an assumption I shouldn’t do, but about 
being a family caregiver is that the relationships are much deeper. There aren’t the professional boundaries 
that a non-family member might have to establish. You have the history with each other, the emotions. Maybe 
you could talk about that for a few minutes. It’s really okay. For the people who aren’t seeing you, and they’re 
reading a transcript, this is an emotional period for you. 
P: 
[Pause] yeah, it is. [Pause – crying] I held—and I still hold a lotta respect for my father-in-law who lives 
with us, and it’s difficult [crying] to see his decline, and he’s still doing pretty well, but you know he’s not the 
man that he used to be. And to see that in his eyes, in his behavior, and to switch roles, and you know, that’s 
all—it’s all difficult. But we’re so glad that he’s here, and we don’t have to worry about him being, you know, so 
far away, and what’s happening with him, and you know, we’re glad that he is here. We’re glad that we’re able 
to help him in his final years. 
I: 
And you’re helping your cousins. You’re helping your cousin with her father as well. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Can you talk about that? When did that start, and what do you do for him? 
P: 
I think it’s getting close to 2 years that I’ve helped my cousin with my uncle, and I go there one evening 
a week and it’s scheduled, so that makes it a lot easier than just kinda bein’ on-call. So, I’m there usually 4 or 5 
hours when I go. Normally, I would arrive and make sure that he gets something to eat, and then we spend the 
rest of the time visiting. We play—he has many interests, and even though he has Alzheimer’s as well or 
maybe it’s just dementia, he still enjoys doing a lot of the things that he did when he was more capable 
[1.11.08], so we’ll play cards, usually poker with money or chips, and we have fun doing that. We play—I don’t 
know if craps is the right word, but dice, and he had to teach me how to do that, but we have fun playing that. 
He loves music, and even though he doesn’t play the guitar like he used to, he enjoys listening and seeing 
others. So, one evening we might just watch video after video of people playing the guitar and singing Mexican 
songs or other Spanish songs. I like music as well, so that’s an interest that we have together that we really 
enjoy. And then I will put him to bed that evening, so we’ll make sure that he gets cleaned up. Usually, means 
a change of a brief, make sure he’s safe in the bathroom. He doesn’t usually wanna change out of his street 
clothes, but it’s usually the same routine, you know, this is what we have to do. So, he’ll get into his pajamas 
and get cleaned up, and sometimes [pause] we pray [crying] before he goes to bed. Sometimes I’ll get our 
music books out from church and sing some church songs for him. [Crying] he enjoys that. Lately he’s been 
more alert and less tired, so even though he’s in bed the sleep isn’t coming, so he now has a TV in his 
bedroom that he can watch with Spanish movies. So, we’ll watch the Spanish movies together. 
I: 
So, you are providing help with getting ready for bed. Can you describe—well, you said a couple of 
times that you him get cleaned up and ready for bed. What does that entail specifically? 
P: 
Well, it first it’ll be a trip to the restroom, and he needs you pretty close. So, make sure that he uses the 
toilet, washes his hands, and then he uses a walker, and he walks pretty slowly, so make sure he gets safely 
from the bathroom to the bed. We put down a towel onto the bedding [1.07.27], and before he sits we’ll take 
down his pants and his brief, and I give him a washcloth or a disposable washcloth, and he’ll wipe his private 
parts, and then I’ll have him stand up, and I wipe his backside and make sure that he’s clean, and then we 
remove his pants and his soiled underwear and give him a fresh pair of underwear. And then get his pajamas 
on.

I: 
And you’re doing this partly to provide some caregiver respite, to help your cousin— 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
--so that she’s able to leave the house for a period of time. 
P: 
Yes. My cousin calls it her date night with her husband, and that is specifically why I’m there as respite 
for her because her father does need the 24-hour care as well. He cannot be left alone. He’s mobile enough 
that if he were to get a notion he could open the door, walk outside, and that wouldn’t be safe. So— 
I: 
He sounds like he’s also unsteady? 
P: 
Yes. He’s quite unsteady. He’s had a few falls that have required that he be hospitalized. He’s broken 
ribs, hurt his head, different things like that. 
I: 
So, he needs someone there really for safety reasons and to monitor his safety and then to help with 
meals, but also with bathing and— 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
And then it sounds like you offer so much companionship/-- 
P: 
Yeah. I’ve— 
I: 
--social interaction. 
P: 
Yeah. He was always the uncle everybody calls their favorite uncle. He came from a family of 10, so 
that’s saying quite a bit [laughing/crying] if he was the favorite, [crying] and it’s because he always took the 
time to greet you at family functions—call you by name, and when we were younger he always would pull the 
quarter out of our ear. You know, just tease us, and make us feel special [crying], so—and that’s saying a lot 
‘cause I think there are close to 70 of us cousins [laughs] and  yeah, so I’m sure everybody would tell ya he 
was their favorite uncle. So [crying], it’s not hard to be his companion. [Crying] he’s well loved and he still, like I 
said, he still has many of his interests, and he’s still the same person [crying]—personality—friendly and giving 
and caring. 
I: 
So, you obviously have a great deal of respect and affection for him? 
P: 
Yes. Yes, I do. 
I: 
And it sounds like you have a remarkably close family. 
P: 
Yeah. We’re pretty close. We’re spread out, but [1.03.06] we’re still close. 
I: 
You’ve mentioned several times that—was he born in Mexico? 
P: 
No. My mother’s family were migrant workers, and they were all born in Texas along the—they call it 
the Valley, and as the crops grew—I guess that would be north—then they would follow the crops. I believe he 
was born maybe in Corpus Cristi. My mother was born in San Antonio, and they’re kinda born—10 of them 
along that Valley. 
I: 
And then how much do you think your heritage—your Mexican heritage has influenced the way in which 
your family is dealing with the need for care? 
P: 
Oh, I think very much. I tell this story—I’ve told it many times that when I was a young girl we were 
going to the grocery store, and they were building a building next to the grocery store. That took a while, and 
every time we’d go to the store I’d ask my dad, what is that? He’d say, “Apartment building.” And I didn’t know 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Maria Cosper. 6.27.18 
 
3
what an apartment building was, so he’d explain it. And then as time went on, he told me that it was going to 
be a senior apartments. Well, what’s senior apartments? You know, “Well, that’s for the older people that don’t 
have anybody to take care of them.” I’m like, Well, why don’t they have anybody to take [crying] care of them? I 
just couldn’t—I couldn’t understand that why [crying] older people wouldn’t have anybody to take care of them 
because the example that I saw in my family and other Mexican families was that when the people got old—
grandma and grandpa and uncle, if they couldn’t take care of themselves then they just moved in with family. 
And it wasn’t just the older people, it was also as families were starting out, and as people came from Texas 
and didn’t have any place to stay, you know, they would just help each other [1.00.28] and live together until 
they could go out on their own. 
I: 
And this doesn’t sound like it’s just your family? 
P: 
No. 
I: 
This is typical of many Mexican families? 
P: 
Yes. I do. Yeah. 
I: 
It’s part of the culture? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. Yeah. I would see it in my neighborhood. It was a neighborhood where I grew up was 
made up of all different races—well, White, Black, and Mexican, but I would see that with the Mexican 
neighbors, but also a neighbor across the street was Black, and they had their big mamma living with them. 
You know, and that’s what I saw, so that’s why it was so hard for me to understand why they needed this huge 
apartment building for seniors that had [crying] nobody to take care of them. 
I: 
So, you helped take care of your father-in-law who lives here. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Your mother-in-law and her husband lives next door. Your cousin’s father. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
That’s a lot of people. Who helps you? 
P: 
Well, I have my husband. We’ve been married for—well, in a few days it’ll be 41 years, and we help 
each other. He’s very supportive and good and loving. I have my daughter, and my son, and their spouses. 
I: 
It sounds like everybody pitches in? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. For the most part. Yes. The children are busy raising their—they each have two children, 
so you know, they’re busy. They’re a young family [58.06], but in a pinch or if I have to or want to get away 
then I’ll schedule the children to come in and help with their—next door with their grandma and grandpa. My 
husband has a brother who lives in town. In past years if we were gonna go away for say a week, then he 
would take his dad. 
I: 
Do you identify yourself as a caregiver? I find that family members especially often don’t even identify 
as a caregiver. You’re say you’re a caregiver, and— 
P: 
Yeah. I would have to say that I do not identify myself as a caregiver. Just a daughter-in-law and niece. 
I: 
We have a couple more minutes, so what do you find most rewarding about what you’re doing for 
family members? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Maria Cosper. 6.27.18

P: 
I think the most rewarding is that there’s peace of mind to know that they’re safe and well taken care of 
that they’re eating right, and they won’t be harmed. 
I: 
What do you find most challenging? 
P: 
I think it’s the personalities. With my mother-in-law, she was kind of the classic mother-in-law that didn’t 
get along with her daughter-in-laws. And I don’t resent it, and even when it was  happening when we were 
younger, I just did my best to ignore it and not talk about it. I didn’t want it to affect the relationship with the 
children [55.17], and [pause] I honestly don’t resent it, but when it’s occurring as I’m trying to take care of her, 
then it’s difficult. She is a difficult woman [laugh/cries], and that’s challenging. 
I: 
We’ll take just a short break. I’m gonna let these continue, but K needs to swap out a couple of things. 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
And give you a chance to rest and gather your thoughts and think about the next set of questions. 
P: 
Okay.  
I: 
You’re doing great. Are you okay? 
P: 
Mmm  hmm. 
I: 
Okay. You know, don’t worry about expressing emotion. I know some of these questions are hard, and 
you know, we’re tapping into things that are—have a real emotional aspect to it, so. And I think that’s maybe a 
big difference between family caregivers and non-family caregivers. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Okay. 
I2: 
One second.  
P: 
The woman that lived there, I never got to know her, but about a year and a half ago the fire trucks 
were there, and they’d been cleaning out the house ever since. So, I think she might have been a hoarder, and 
so there’s usually a lotta workers there, and noisy vehicles and stuff like that. 
I: 
Fascinating isn’t it. 
P: 
And they’re not quiet [52.40], you know, when they’re working. It’s like, God. I had the grandkids out 
here once playing, and the workers were there, and they were—“Are they fighting?” [Laughs] no, they’re just 
using bad language. 
I: 
Oh. Very sensitive. You had some questions? 
I2: 
Yeah. I was just gonna say that when you think about your family members and how they have different 
needs at this stage in their life, can you just say—you don’t have to say even full sentences, but can you say 
what you think about? What verse comes to mind? What, yeah, I’m just gonna let you free-verse on that topic 
of your family members being in more need and losing some of their autonomy? Like if you could just talk more 
about that a little bit. I know it’s a big question, but I just kinda want to know more. How it makes you feel? 
What that makes you think about? 
P: 
[Pause]. 
I2: 
Let me know if you need help with that question?

P: 
Okay. I think I understand what you’re asking. Regarding my father-in-law that lives with us, he was 
always a very independent person [crying] and he still is, as much as he can be. You know, he was an 
insurance adjustor, and he traveled following national disasters or hurricanes or that sort of thing. And he 
enjoyed it because he was able to help people who were in trouble, and he made good money at it. He worked 
I think until he was in his early 70s, and so I guess what I’m trying to say is that he was very independent and 
had a lotta self-worth [49.51], and I think [crying], now that he’s older, he’s not earning an income I think that 
is—it gives him less self-worth, and that’s hard—[crying] that’s hard to see. But lately, in the last 2 years—he’s 
been with us 8 years, and in about the last 2 years, even though we had urged him on prior to get involved in 
the community, and he still drove—he still drives, and he finally got in touch with a senior volunteer group, and 
now he volunteers at three or four different locations. And he calls it his work. He does not call it volunteering. 
“I’m going to work.” It just made a difference in his [crying] outlook, and that’s been better for him, and it’s 
brought his spirits up, and I think even lately he’s been—he’s always cared about the way he looks, and he’s 
starting to get dressed up more, and just, you know, he walks taller. 
I2: 
Mmm hmm. 
P: 
And it—I try not to be on his case for the little things, you know, around the house that he might mess 
up, but sometimes I mess up, and I forget. I’m trying not to do that [laughs]. So, I try to be as kind as I can 
because there are things that you just don’t want to continue, so my husband and I, we’re both very conscious 
with him to not treat him like a child. That he is an adult, and so we don’t ask him where are you going? Where 
have you been? You know, if he wants to share that with us, that’s fine, but it’s also—it’s also hard not 
knowing, you know, when he leaves at 7 in the morning, and he doesn’t come home until 7 at night—don’t 
know where he’s been; don’t know what he’s been doin’, but we have to be okay with that. 
I2: 
So, your whole life you have known your elders, and you’ve known them a certain way, and all of a 
sudden in the last 8 years you see—or how many years each person you see—a major shift, and that is 
bothersome. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I2: 
Yeah. 
P: 
Yes. It is. With my mother-in-law that lives next door and her husband, he worked for I think 45 years 
for General Motors. So, you know his job was very important to him, and now if he talks to you—I mean when 
he talks to you, you are gonna hear stories about his job [45.10] and what he did, and he’s had two hip 
surgeries, so he doesn’t get around well. And after this last hip surgery, after the therapy and that sort of thing 
was over, he planned that he was gonna go golfing. So, for weeks, you know, he got his golf stuff out, and did 
whatever he had to do for that. He went and found golfing clubs—senior golfing club to join, and then finally the 
day came where he could go golfing. And he came home upset because he found out he couldn’t do it, and it 
took a while—I mean he tried different places to go. You know, maybe it was the place; maybe it wasn’t him, 
and you know, maybe it was different people that he should be golfing with sort of thing, but finally he came to 
the conclusion that he’s just not able to go golfing anymore. 
I: 
Physically? 
P: 
Yeah. He’s not able physically to do what it takes to golf. 
I: 
Hard to accept. 
P: 
Yeah. It was very hard for him to accept, and I’m sure it [pause]—how should I put it. I think it was really 
like, wham! You just can’t do this anymore, you know. I think that was hard for him. And then, he was cutting 
the grass yesterday, and I didn’t even know a riding lawnmower had cruise. It’s a bad idea, so apparently, he 
just lost control of the lawnmower, crashed into the fence. It flipped, and he couldn’t get up. And apparently, he 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Maria Cosper. 6.27.18 
 
6
was crying out for help and a neighbor heard him and came and helped him get up, and then soon thereafter, 
you know, the family was there to help him [42.18]. And so, now, he’s not going to be cutting grass anymore. 
So, I think— 
I: 
So, another loss? 
P: 
Yeah. I think for him it’s another realization that he’s not gonna be able to do things that he enjoyed. 
I: 
You said the family was sworn to secrecy which suggests that he’s embarrassed as well? 
P: 
Yeah. Yeah, I think it’s, yeah. For him, I should, yeah—for him I believe that I am his new mother. You 
know, I’m the one that makes sure he takes his medicine, makes sure that, you know, he’s doin’ the things that 
he needs to do for his health, anyway. Did you eat? What did you eat? Make sure you put the cold stuff back 
into the refrigerator [laughs[, you know, kinda like a mom. So, I think the way a child doesn’t want mom to know 
he got in trouble, I think that’s what it is, and I’m willing to go along with it. It’s okay. 
I: 
All these shifts in roles within the family. 
P: 
And with my mother-in-law, she seems—she has the Alzheimer’s disease, which she doesn’t think that 
she has. When we go to doctor’s appointments, of course, it comes up, and she always says, “I don’t have 
that.” You know, we don’t talk about it at home. There’s no reason for us to, but when we go to the doctor’s 
office she’ll say, “I don’t have that.” But because of her condition, it’s almost like she doesn’t realize what she’s 
lost, and it almost seems like she’s okay with the fact that she wears a brief and that she wets it. The other day 
she said, “Well, that’s why I wear it.” So, maybe in way the Alzheimer’s is—I mean she has her physical 
ailments, too, you know, where she uses a walker. Maybe the Alzheimer’s is a—I don’t know—a buffer, so that 
she doesn’t understand what she’s lost, physically, and mentally, and her autonomy [38.45]. 
I: 
She’s more able to handle it then with her husband. 
P: 
Yeah. She really seems okay with it. 
I: 
Are you okay? 
I2: 
Yeah. I’m fine. I think you can just keep going. 
I: 
In how long? 
I2: 
Eighteen minutes. 
I: 
Oh, good. All right. We’re gonna keep going. Have you received any training for the care that you 
provide all of these relatives? 
P; 
No. Not specifically for them. I work with school-age children to do that. I have had first-aid training, 
CPR training. Along the way, I’ve learned how to take blood pressure, use a little device to check oxygen level. 
Learned a lot by taking them to doctor’s appointments, asking questions to understand different things that are 
going on. 
I: 
And you’ve learned kind of on the job training. 
P: 
Yes. Definitely learned on the job. 
I: 
Do you worry at all about, well injuring yourself or how to handle a situation that might come up that 
you’re not prepared to handle? So, for example with your cousin’s father, you are there to protect him, make 
sure he’s safe ‘cause he’s unsteady on his feet. Has there ever been a situation where you were worried about 
how to handle it?

P: 
I’ve never been afraid of not knowing what to do to take care of my uncle, but with his dementia or 
Alzheimer’s, when I first started caring for him, he didn’t remember that his wife had passed away [35.57]. And 
it was more a matter of my not knowing how to either divert the conversation or somehow to relieve his anxiety 
that he was having that he hadn’t seen his wife. He didn’t know where she was, and my telling him that she 
had passed away really wasn’t helping. So, it was more a matter of my not knowing how to handle the situation 
so that his anxiety wasn’t elevated. That’s been more of a concern, but my cousin gave me a book to help me 
learn how to deal with that, and I’ve talked it over with her as well, and she gives me tips on how she handles 
situations like that. 
I: 
So, would some training in that area, in knowing a little bit more about the different kinds of dementia 
and what to expect? Would it have been helpful? 
P: 
Yes. Yes. Going into it definitely would have been helpful to know how to handle situations like that to 
alleviate that anxiety. 
I: 
Are there other types of trainings or resources that would be helpful for you? 
P: 
[Pause] well, for instance with my mother-in-law, because she has so many appointments that she 
goes to for different things or just taking her to get her hair done or out to eat, we got a wheelchair for her, and 
I’m not a very big or strong person, and having to handle the wheelchair—loading it, unloading it, and then 
actually pushing her in it was more of a—was harder than I expected it was gonna be, and I had to learn on the 
job how to do those sorts of things without hurting myself. 
I: 
So, some body mechanics, how to lift things and transfer and all of that? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
If you don’t mind talking a little bit about the financial end of things, my understanding is that with your 
cousin she pays you to come once a week for the date night. Can I ask how much you’re getting for that? 
P: 
Like I said, I’m usually there 4 or 5 hours, and she pays me $100 for the evening. 
I: 
So, about $25 an hour. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And you also mentioned that you have some friends who are paid caregivers as well? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
You mentioned this woman from Rwanda? 
P: 
Yeah. Mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, you know of other caregivers, some who are not family caregivers. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. Well, I have a friend who is a caregiver, and she relieves me in the afternoon [31.50] with 
my mother-in-law, and when she first started working for them she agreed to $11 an hour, and then after about 
6 or 7 months, and I saw how hard she worked, and she’s very dependable, I just said to my father-in-law, I 
said, you need to pay her more. So, I asked her what she thought would be fair, and she said, $13. So, I said, 
okay, $13. So, now, she get’s paid $13 an hour. But in my experience with my mother-in-law she’s had 
homecare givers come and they provide—in dealing with them I understood that if they were to come like to 
relieve me it would be $26 an hour. Now, that’s what the agency would charge. What the actual caregiver 
receives, I don’t know.

I: 
And this person that comes to relieve you, what kind of help does she give you? 
P: 
Well, initially what I asked her to do was to be the companion, similar to what I do with my uncle. But 
my mother-in-law likes to rest a lot, so when she—after the caregiver will feed her, you know, help her with the 
bathroom needs, a lotta times my mother-in-law will just rest. So, the caregiver is the type of a person that 
she’s not just gonna sit and do nothing while—so, she will do housework—laundry, mop the floors, do the 
dishes, and prepare meals. So, she does it all [29.12]. 
I: 
Can you talk a for a minute about what that means for you? The help that she’s providing for you? 
P: 
Oh, yeah. Without her, without my friend who’s providing the afternoon caregiver for my mother-in-law, 
I’d be overwhelmed [cries]. I mean I still have to do those things—the housekeeping type things on the 
weekends, but I’d be overwhelmed if I had to do it during the week. 
I: 
So, the possibility exists that you wouldn’t—this would not be sustainable? You wouldn’t be able to— 
P: 
Yeah. I don’t think— 
I: 
--to keep her at home? 
P: 
Right. If somebody weren’t there doing the things that she does for us, I don’t think she’d be able to 
stay there. I think we could get—hire other—from another agency or from an agency, but I don’t think we’d get 
the same service. 
I: 
So, your friend is not with an agency? You’re hiring her directly? 
P: 
No. Yes. 
I: 
Okay. This is an interesting situation because you’re getting paid to take care of one family member 
and paying somebody else to take care of another family member, and it’s all allowing all of these family 
members to stay at home. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. And that’s important. I think it’s so important for them to stay home. I’ve been in several 
nursing homes or what they call—what do they call ‘em—assisted living, sometimes rehab, and I don’t like the 
things I see there [27.08]. 
I: 
Like, for example? 
P: 
For example, I see elderly just in the hallways, usually in a wheelchair either just slumped over or just 
kind of wheeling around aimlessly. I see—well it’s not so much the seeing, you can hear people crying out for 
help; nobody responds. 
I: 
So, the value of staying at home is the immediate attention and the quality of life? We’re gonna stop 
there for just for a minute, and you can swap things out. And while we’re taking this little break, maybe you 
could think about all this caregiving you’re providing or receiving from this other person you were talking about, 
and you’ve been doing that for a number of years now, if there are certain stories or scenarios that standout in 
your memory, in your mind, maybe if somebody was to ask you, “Well, tell me a story about what it’s like to 
have somebody living here? You know, what kind of things have happened to you over the years?” Do some 
stories jump to mind? And I can ask that again if it’s not [inaudible]— 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Maybe think about that for a minute. You know, what are one of the best things that have happened or 
most rewarding things? Maybe what story that illustrates something difficult that has happened? If you’re 
comfortable sharing the stories.

I2: 
Almost ready. 
I: 
Say when? 
I2: 
Almost. Camera. 
I: 
I’m gonna repeat the question that I just asked because we’re on audio again. You’ve been providing 
care to different family members for a number of years now, and you’re now hiring people to help you provide 
care as well. Over the years can you think of some times, scenarios, stories that sort of are significant, jump 
out at you? Maybe a time that was—a situation that was particularly difficult and a time that was particularly 
rewarding. 
P: 
Well, I’ll start with a good time. With my father-in-law who’s lived with us for 8 years, it was a couple of 
thanksgiving’s ago. We’d been in this house for almost 4 years, so I would say it was maybe 3  years ago, 
while we were going through some things we found a letter that he wrote to his parents when he was [crying] 
serving in Korea [22.57], and we framed it, and at Thanksgiving when everybody was here for Thanksgiving 
dinner, we handed it to him, and asked him to read it as this is our Thanksgiving prayer. So, he read it, and it 
wasn’t until he got to the end where he saw that it was his signature with his rank that he was really amazed 
[crying], and he was thankful that we had done that for him, and that he was able to read it and it still meant so 
much [crying] to us that Thanksgiving Day, and we still have it framed on the wall with his service picture. So, it 
is a constant reminder. 
I: 
That’s a wonderful story. Thank you for sharing that. 
P: 
Something really nice. And just to hear him say, ‘cause we go to the same church, and to hear him say 
in front of my husband and I, he’ll say [crying] “They’re good people. They take care of me, and they take care 
of his mother and her husband.” He’ll say, “They’re good people, and [crying] that means a lot to me. The 
difficult times, when I think of them, they’re just so petty, and I feel [crying] ashamed, you know, about the 
dishes that he washes, and he puts them in the cupboard and they’re not clean. You know, and most of the 
time I can just take ‘em out and just forget about it, but every now and then depending on what’s goin’ on, I 
have to write him a note. And it, like I said before, it’s something that I don’t want to continue and perpetuate, 
but really, it’s so petty. I feel [crying] ashamed [19.57]. 
I: 
Well, I appreciate you sharing that with us, and I think to K’s point, with the changing roles, there are so 
many dynamics that you have to negotiate as you go, and within a family relationship versus a non-family 
member who, you know [inaudible] boundaries. And within family, boundaries may not be there. Can you talk—
a moment ago you were talking about the value of  your friend helping you, and that it makes all the difference 
in terms of whether or not your mother-in-law can stay at home or not. If you could share that, I think that’s 
important for people to know. For our government officials, our legislators, for the public to understand what a 
difference it makes to have a caregiver in the home that allows people to stay at home. If K was the President 
of the United States or the Governor and had some power to make a difference in terms of caregiver support, 
what would you like to say? 
P: 
Well, I would like the people who have the authority to make a difference to know that I think there are 
many families out there who would like to keep their elderly at home, in their own home for as long as possible, 
but that is very difficult without a lot of support, and I think that if there were more caregivers that were able to 
come into the homes and help the family the way that my friend helps us—I think there needs to be—honestly, 
I just think there needs to be a different mindset, and all I can talk about is America ‘cause that’s where I live. I 
think there needs to be a change in the mindset of what will our elderly be doing when they’re no longer 
working, no longer to take care of their own needs in their home. I think we need to have people that are able 
to—that are trained, willing, and able to help families keep the elderly in their home and able to do the things—
the cooking, the cleaning, and attending to personal needs at home. I’m not sure what—I’m not sure really

what that would take, whether it’s just a career for caregivers [15.21] or whether it would be something else. 
But there needs to be that help. 
I: 
Before we started we were talking about the caregiver shortage. We have a critical shortage right now 
of caregiver—paid caregivers, so part of the challenge is—or part of the reason for it is the lack of benefits, the 
low pay, the lack of guaranteed hours. You mentioned you’re paying your friend $11 and then $13, what do 
you think about the rate of pay for workers? 
P: 
Well, I think it should be more. I’m surprised that she didn’t ask for more. I told her, you name it, but 
that’s what she asked for. But if she were a younger person—I should say a younger person with a family 
whether it be male or female I think they would need the hours and the wages in order to be able to afford the 
housing and the food and everything it takes to raise the family. 
I: 
The average wage for a personal care worker is about $10 an hour, and most of them will tell you they 
can’t make ends meet on that, so it’s tough to go to young people, for example, and convince them that this 
would be a good career for them. But what would you tell people who are interested in doing this kind of work? 
Why they should get into it, and what it takes? 
P: 
Well, I think it’s important work, but I think that you have to have a—I’ll use a term I hear in church a lot, 
which is a servant’s heart. I think if you don’t have a [crying] servant’s heart that I don’t think you could really 
do it. I mean I can imagine that someone could go through the mechanics of it, but you have to have a warm, 
loving personality to do this kind of work. I think if you don’t have that, you won’t last because it is difficult, and 
there are things that you have to do in the course of the work that a lot of people—it’s not something they 
wanna do every day. 
I: 
Could you give several examples? 
P: 
Well, the first example I would give is something somebody wouldn’t wanna do is the toileting. The 
toileting requirements. There’s also with—I guess you would call it digestion [10.50], sometimes the food 
doesn’t stay down, and you have to be there helping them with that, too. You know, if they’re throwing up, 
you’re right there with the bucket, and you have to take care of all of that sort of thing. Then there’s the 
showering, the showering is—it’s difficult physically. It’s kinda scary because they could trip and fall, so you 
have to be careful that way. And then there’s just—you’re giving someone else a bath, and just the way you 
clean yourself, you have to do that for someone else. So, that can be very uncomfortable or gross for someone 
else, for some people to have to do. 
I: 
So, you need a servant’s heart. You need to be willing to do difficult work that’s physically difficult, but 
also might be a turnoff to most people. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Bodily functions. There’s some safety risks with the client but also the worker. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Other characteristics that you think a good caregiver should have? 
P: 
Well, you have to be very patient, and you have to be tolerant, understanding [pause], I think you have 
to be smart. There’s a lot of decision-making ‘cause you’re making decisions for someone—the welfare of 
someone else. 
I: 
So, some problem solving. 
P: 
Mmm hmm.

I: 
It’s not like you have a whole staff of people behind you or an RN you can call and say, what do we do? 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
So, you’re negotiating things right then and there on the spot. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, I have a young person in front of me that I’m tellin’ em, well, you’re not gonna make that much 
money— 
P: 
[Laughs] 
I: 
--you’re gonna have to clean up somebody’s bodily functions, it’s gonna be physically difficult, requires 
a lot of patience, why would they do it? What’s something more positive that might encourage them to go for it 
anyway despite all of those challenges? 
P: 
Well, it’s wonderful knowing that you’re helping someone [7.13], and it’s also wonderful knowing that 
you’re helping their final years be good. It’s good to know that you’re making someone happy. 
I: 
What would you say to somebody who describes this work as low-skilled or unskilled? 
P: 
Mmm. I don’t think it is unskilled or low-skilled. I would liken it to nursing, and that certainly is a high-
skilled job. 
I: 
What would you say to somebody who says, “Well, you’re just a glorified babysitter” What would you 
say to somebody like that? 
P: 
Well, that’s another thing that I—because I like to work with children as well, nursery school, school 
age, and I think there’s a correlation in that. That type of job is not given the credit that is due, and it’s like in 
America we don’t value the little ones like we should, and we don’t value our elderly like we should. So, if 
someone were to say that it’s just being a glorified babysitter in mind that’s [laughing] the best job to have. You 
know, what better thing to do than to take care of the little ones or to take [crying] care of our elderly. I don’t 
think there’s a better job. 
I: 
That’s such a lovely statement to end on, but I want to give you the chance to—do you have any final 
stories or thoughts that you want to share with the world? 
P: 
[Pause] as much as I would dream that there are many people out there that [crying] believe the way 
that I do, that we need to care for our elderly, I know that there are a lot of people who dismiss the 
responsibility or the value that taking care of elderly people [crying] provide to us, but I think that if we don’t 
take care of them then it’s—I don’t think we’ll be as good of a nation that we could be. 
I: 
That’s a good statement. Do you have any questions for M? So, I wanna thank you again, M, that you 
were wonderful in just sharing stories that I know were very difficult for you to share, so I appreciate your 
candor and your willingness to sort of let us in—a view of your world, and the only way is to let us share it with 
others. And again, thank you for the work that you’re doing because being a caregiver is such important work, 
so we value what you’re doing. Do you have any final questions? No? Well, we’ll stop it there then, and K’s 
gonna work his magic now. Do some beautiful photographs of you, and maybe you could explain to M? I told 
her how we might be using the films, but you will be able at some point in time to get copies of all the pieces. 
P: 
Okay.

I: 
So, we want to use similar to the refuge [?] party that I talked to you about. Our goal is to have like 
show around this project, and to bring people together that already care, but also to bring people together that 
don’t enough about your field.
