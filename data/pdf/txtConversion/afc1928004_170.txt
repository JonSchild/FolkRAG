CONUNDRUMS. 
Written by ROBBY -NEWCOMB expressly for BILLY WEST. 
I've often asked some funny things 
To please you for awhile, 
And many a 
time as my reward 
Received a 
pleasant smile. 
Fin going to sing a 
song to-night, 
I 
hope to please you well. 
A few Conundrums I 
will ask, 
And then the answer tell. 
The first one that Um going to ask, 
By way of table- talk, 
It's why is kissing a 
Pretty Girl— 
Like taking soup with a 
fork. 
Of course the answer I 
can give 
For I 
am up to snuff, 
Like eating soup with a 
fork it is 
'Cause its hard to get enough. 
The next one that I'm going to ask, 
And what it is about, 
Is what does a 
little ragged boy do 
When he wears his pants out. 
Why if he wears them out, of course, 
Time answer it is plain 
He does not worry himself at all 
But wears them Home again. 
Now here's one on the Ladies, 
And it's just a 
passing hit : 
Why is a 
soldier like a 
girl ? 
The answer what is it. 
The difference ' twixt a 
soldier 
And a 
girl so strange occurs. 
The soldier faces powder 
But the girl she powders her's.

OLD TIME'S ROCKS. 
• . Zlituju Sulu auug by Bn..Lx Wars. 
The way we travel now-a-days, 
Surprises us with its different ways. 
. 
In Chicago they go it by pitch and toss," 
You can jump off for ten minutes 
AndIret a 
Divorce. 
CHORUS. 
Then it's old Time's Rocks is number one, 
Oh how is that for high. 
The Telegraph workers are on a 
strike, 
The way things are working 
They don't seem to like. 
The last message thy sent I 
think was a 
stunner, 
To tight it out on one wire if it took all summer. 
Then it's, cte. 
011, Fisk, the Eric Prince, is pie, 
He's always exclaiming, ' How's that for high." 
I 
bear from Alaska he's buying up bears. 
But in Jersey they've snatched him 
For raising the fares. 
Then it's, &c. 
The Mormons they have had a 
flare, 
Each other's opinions to pieces they tear. 
Brigham Young still coos like an old turtle dove. 
Says he's coming on North, 
To go in for free love. 
Then it's, &c.

41: 
This evening it occurred to me, 
What curious sights sometimes we see, 
For things are not as they used to be 
In the days of Hickory Jackson. 
In every thing there's been a 
change, 
A wouderous change, a 
mighty change 
We have many notions rather strange 
Since the days of Hickory Jackson. 
For the people were ambitious then 
To honor none but honest men. 
I 
wish these times would come again— 
The days of Hickory Jackson. 
The ladies then quite different were, 
For diamond sets they did not care, 
Nor their husbands' fortunes did they wear 
In silks and shawls and satins, 
They'd no false hair nor waterfalls. 
Large waterfalls, large waterfalls, 
Nor spent their time at hops and balls. 
In the days of Hickory Jackson, 
For the ladies were more modest then. 
They didn't flirt with all the men, 
I 
wish those times would come again— 
The days of Hickory Jackson.

HICKORY JACRSON.—[CONCLUDED. 
The working man then had a 
chance 
his circumstances to advance, 
And everything he ate or drank, 
lie didn't have a 
tax on. 
No greenbacks they had on hand, 
They had on hand, they had on hand, 
But gold and silver throughout the land . 
In the days of Hickory Jackson. 
Oh everything was plenty then, 
What glorious times for working men, 
I 
wish those times would come again— 
The days of Hickory Jackson. 
For liberty they had speeches good, 
And side by side like brothers stoOd, 
Leave honor's path they never would 
In the days of Hickory Jackson. 
They had no internal revenue tax 
Revenue tax, Revenue tax. 
To raise old Harry on our backs, 
In the days of Hickory Jackson. 
But soon the time is coming when 
We'll pay our debts and once again 
The sun will shine on happy men, 
As it did on Hickory Jackson.

MOTHER SAYS I SHOULDN 'T. 
W ritten by G. 
L. 
STOUT. 
Sang by BILLY W EST. 
A nice young gal I 
used to court, 
With all my might and main, 
She was one of a 
very fascinating sort 
And her name was, Matilda Jane. 
I 
loved her long, I 
loved her strong, 
This beautiful, bewitching little miss, 
But one excuse she always used 
•Whene'er I 
asked -a 
kiss. 
Spoken :—Yes whenever I 
said Tilly ; you see I 
called her 
Tilly whenever I 
want to flatter her, Tilly I 
say if you'd 
only give me a smack of your ruby lips. I 
shall sink in 
rapture at your feet. 
Then she'd pout her lips and just 
when I 
thought 1 
was about to revel in ambrosial nectar ; 
Imagine my surprise when she'd exclaim 
CHORUS. 
No indeed I 
durstn't, 
Mother says I 
mustn't, 
Oh George, dear George, 
Not it I 
know myself. 
Mother says I 
shouldn't, 
If she was me she wouldn't 
Oh, George, yes, George, 
That thing's played. 
I 
called one day to see my Til, 
But I 
found the family out, 
And so to while away the time 
I 
thought I'd look about. 
[I] 
MOTHER SAYS I SHOULDN'T.—[CONCLUDED. 
I 
entered darling Tilly's room, 
Not thinking for to spy. 
And there upon the mantle shelf, 
I 
saw her teeth and eye. 
Spoken :—Yes if you'd believe me, there upon the man-
tle piece I 
saw a 
set of false teeth and a 
glass eye ; then I 
discovered the reason she wouldn't kiss Inc. 
She was 
afraid of swallowing her teeth, or her eye going back on 
her, and she thought to get out of it by saying 
No indeed, tte. 
I 
quickly in my pocket put, 
Poor Tilly's teeth and eye, 
And as I 
thought some one might come, 
deemed it best to fly, 
1 
called that night, she'd not be seen 
I 
know the reason why, 
She searched the house all o'er and o'er 
But couldn't find her teeth or eye. 
,`-poken :—Yes she went the next day and got measured 
for a 
new set of teeth and a new glass eye, and when I 
called she was all right again. 
She placed her head upon 
this manly bosom and said, 
Oh George, dear George 
when are we to wed : I 
dropped on myself and exclaimed 
CHORUS 
No indeed I 
dustn't, 
Mother says I 
mustn't, 
Oh George, dear George, 
Not if know myself. 
Mother says I 
shouldn't, 
If she was me she wouldn't, 
Oh, George, yes, George 
That thing's played.

BLACK AND TANNED. 
Written by J. F. Poole, expressly for BILLY WEST. 
Oh lam an unhappy melte. 
A more wretched one never was seen; 
111 tell you the cause, 
And you'll say what a 
victim I've been. 
For I 
loved a 
fair maid, 
As black 
toe Ace of Spades; 
She was chief engineer of a 
kitchen near here, 
And Boss of the Scullery maids. 
CHORUS. 
Oh my, what a 
shame, another galoot came about, 
lie was a 
black millionaire, and quickly he cot me out, 
My eye, what a 
shame, i 
f 
I 
only could catch that galoot, 
I'd send him a 
challenge to meet me to-night, 
And I'd bat him right in the snoot. 
Tier name you must know. 
Was Georgia Juliet Fan ; 
His name I've been told 
Was Alonzo Othello McCann. 
He was a 
linty() of Greece, 
A man in the soap fat line; 
And only she fell in love with his can, 
That kitchen maid might have been mine. 
Oh my, 
One night to the kitchen T 
went, 
And then what a 
sight did I 
see ; 
The soap fat man was there with his can, 
And she sitting right on his knee. 
In a 
rage I 
rushed at them both, 
Him to the ground I 
did fling; 
And there in the kitchen I 
knocked out his brains, 
With a 
stone from my Diamond ring. 
Oh my, Sze. 
She for a 
policeman did call, 
And quickly they rosbed to the stoop; 
They found the girl was smothered right there, 
With her head in a 
pot of clam soup. 
They dragged me off to the court. 
And there not a 
word could -I 
speak; 
They tried me her stealing the soap fat can, 
And hung me in less than a 
week. 
CHORUS. 
Oh my, what a 
shame, another galoot came about, 
He was a 
black millionaire and quickly be emit me out 
My eye, what a 
shame, that yaller gal might have been mine, 
And we'd all to alive if it wasn't for him, 
That man in the soap tat:line 
GLA SS PUT 
Sung by BILLY W EST. 
I'll sing you the truth of a 
gallant youth, 
And his name it was Johnny Glass; 
He was a 
Glazier by trade, and the stamps he made, 
As through the back streets he'd pass. 
He commenced in lite with his putty and balite 
And a 
box lull of glass to begin.; 
He was as fat as a 
cub, and fond of his grub, 
As he halloed out glass put in.. 
He would rise like a 
lark, from daylight to dark 
He'd trudge around through the wind and rain; 
By the light of the lamp, he would count out his stamps, 
Next morning he would be oft again. 
it was, jfa- t
o his soul, a 
pane with a 
hole, 
Or a 
window patched up NVitil till j 
Lie would turn up his eyes, and yelp like a 
purp, 
Do you want any glass put in. 
But a 
sad mishap befell- this chap, 
And the IttUlt wa'S nOt 
lliS OW11* 
. -

He was shot thro' the heart with a 
sly Cupid's dart, 
By a 
little Dutch gftl half grown, 
With her II 
ilge left paw, she'd smack him in the jaw, 
hen ‘voilld get too full ot gin ; 
As he'd roll in the dirt, says she where are you hurt, 
But his answer was glass put 
lie.maite. her his_frau,.hut I 
can't_teltyou how 
10, 
They passed their honey-tmion ; 
But. time -kratit was hot, a 
smoking in the pot, 
Every day, as he'd toddle home at noon. 
'As years rolled by, four babies would cry, 
Three boys and a -girl, what a 
sin ; 
He christened the lass. put . in glass. 
And the boys he called glass put in.

.A. HUNDRED YEARS AGO.—[CONCLUDED.] 
The gay and giddy crowd, 
Which every day we view, 
Both old and young have passions strong 
As those our grandsires knew ; 
In friendship and in truth, 
You'll find ' twas ever so, 
For fools believed, and knaves deceived, 
A 
hundred years ago. 
A 
hundred years ago, 
A 
hundred years ago, 
For fools believed, and knaves deceived, 
A 
hundred years ago. 
Let heroes talk of war, 
In ages passed away, 
The laurels won were proudly borne, 
As those they win to-day; 
What though our valiant arms 
Lay prostrate every foe, 
The men of old were quite as bold, 
A 
hundred years ago. 
A hundred years ago, 
A 
hundred years ago, 
The men of old were quite as bold, 
A 
hundred years ago. 
Then since 'twas ever so, 
Let pleasure be the theme, 
The song entwine with wit and wine, 
And women reign supreme; 
Why gather life's dark flowers, 
When bright ones around must grow, 
It was the same what e'er you name, 
A 
hundred years ago. 
A 
hundred years ago, 
A 
hundred years ago. 
It was the same what e'er you name, 
A 
hundred years ago.

THE FROG. 
Sung by 131-
1.LY W EST. 
Of all the funny things alive, 
In woodland, marsh or bog, 
That creeps the earth or flies the air, 
The tunniest is the frog. 
The frog, the scientific of nature's handiwork. 
Handiwork, handiwork, handiwork. 
The frog that does not fly the air, 
But goes it with a 
jerk. 
You see him dressed in bottle-green, 
And colored fancy vest. 
He plunges right into the mud, 
In all his Sunday best. 
When he stands up, he's sitting down, 
As Bryan O'Lynn once said. 
And, for convenience sake, he wears 
His eyes in the top of his head. 
You see him sitting on a 
log 
Above time vasty deep. 
You feel inclined to say, " old chap," 
U look B. 4 U leap! 
You raise your Cane to hit him 
On his nasty ugly mug. 
But before you get it half way up 
Away he goes Ka- chug! 
BANJO SOLO—" HOW IS THAT -E0B, HIGH." 
Written for and Sung by BILLY W EST. 
The prettiest girl I 
ever saw 
I 
met the other day. 
So gracefully she tripped along. 
The festive gay Broadway. 
A pretty little glove she dropped, 
As she went passing by 
I 
picked it up, she smiled and bowed, 
Oh how is that for high ? 
I 
took the hint, we walked along 
Together down the street. 
Unluckily for us just then 
IIer lover we did meet. 
He boldly walked right up to me 
With danger in his eye 
Saying walk off young man, 
He won't says she--
Oh how is that tor high ? 
We left him standing in the street 
We arm- in-arm did go, 
I 
ask'd her if she would be my wife, 
You bet she didn't say no. 
Next week we're going to married be 
If our home you should pass by, 
Drop in and see my little wife, 
I 
know you'll think she's high.

BANJO SOLO— " MY DARLING MARY JANE." 
Sung by BILLY W EST. 
Oh, white folks, now I'll sing a 
song. 
It's neither old nor new, 
But while I 
pick the banjo strings 
I'll vaunt it out for you. 
It's all about and just because 
I 
loved, but all ip vain, 
A girl that weighed three hundred pounds, 
And her name was Mary Jane. 
CHORUS 
She was the only girl I 
ever loved, 
My darling Mary Jane. 
She run oil with a 
Jersey man, 
Never to come back again. 
She was as handsome as a 
hollyhock, 
Her vanity I'll expose, 
She'd onion eyes and carrot hair, 
And such a 
turnip nose. 
She had a 
gtunboil on the end, 
That looked in shape and form 
Like a 
strawberry struck by lightning 
Just after a 
thunder storm. 
She was the only girl, &c. 
Her hair it was a 
lovely red 
You could not help admire. 
When she got mad it rose right up 
Just like a 
ball of fire. 
She dressed it in the latest style, 
A waterfall it's called. 
She wore it right on the top of her head 
To cover a 
spot that's bald. 
She was the only girl, &e. 
I 
would not care not half so much 
It my poor heart was slain. 
By any other feminine 
Except my Mary Jaue. 
Oh when I 
catch tat Jersey num 
hotthee hint , like a 
ball. 
I'll pin his ears to the back of his neck, 
And swallow him boots and all. 
She was the only girl, &c. 
BARBER AND BUTCHER. 
Banjo Solo by BILLY W EST. 
I'll sing of a 
darkie that lived in this city, 
lie was a 
melodious and sweet-scented coon ; 
His hair it was curly, his heels double-jointed, 
lie x'as chief engineer of' a 
barber saloon. 
To see him each morning a 
handling the razor, 
The people wo ill gather in crowds round the door; 
And all would exclaim as he slapped on the lather, 
Such a 
sweet-scented bather they ne'er saw before. 
There was a 
young maiden, her name was O'Brien, 
Provost Marshal was she in a 
kitchen close by ; 
She would pass by the shop on her way to the market, 
And in at the barber she'd ( brow a 
sheep's eye. 
The barber would wait till he saw her returning, 
And quietly then to the door he would come ; 
And a 
box of pomade he'd slip into her basket, 
And then drink her health in a 
pint of Bay Ruin. 
But a 
young butcher boy, by the name of Hans Schneider, 
He heard of the barber and jealous he grew ; 
Ile loaded a 
bladder with kidneys and doughnuts, 
And straight for the sweet-scented barber he flew. 
Then the battle commenced aud the slaughter was awful, 
They with murder intent on each other did rush ; 
Bat the barber he soon got the best of the butcher, 
Ile blew out his brains with a 
lathering brush. 
When Matilda O'Brien she heard of the slaughter, 
She made np her mind to commit suicide; 
She swallowed three gallons of brandy and water. 
And then she went down in the cellar and died. 
Then the barber went crazy and busted his business, 
At policy played and his money let fly ; 
lie melted and melted clear down to a 
shadow, 
'Filen poisoned himselt with a 
box of hair dye.

THE ANIMALS' FAIR. 
Sung by BILLY W EST. 
Just listen to my lay, 
I 
know its going to please you; 
The song l'm going to sing. 
Is just the style to suit you. 
I 
had a 
dream and it did seem 
To be most awful queer; 
For the Birds and Beasts they had a 
Fair, 
And I 
was Overseer. 
It was the Anima s' Fair, 
The Birds and Beasts were there ; 
The gay baboon by the light of the moon 
He combed his auburn hair. 
The monkey he got drunk, 
Fell down on the elephant's trunk, 
The elephant sneezed, 
Fell on his knees, 
And how was that for the monk. 
The jay- bird played the flute, 
The musk-rat played the fiddle; 
The tiger-cat and the mouse 
Danced up and down the middle 
The elephant hugged the bull dog's neck, 
And the bear got up his dander: 
The camel smashed the fox in the eyes, 
And bit oft' the ear of the gander. 
The bear ho wanted a 
drink, 
The crocodile he did wink, 
They tossed a 
cent, 
The goose was sent, 
But she got full with the mink ; 
The mosquito said to the flea 
This is no place for me ; 
The mosquito stung the lion's nose, 
And the wild-cat swallowed the bee. 
The squirrel he called for hash, 
And fish- balls made of mud; 
The cow she chewed tel.> cro, 
Then threw away her cod. 
Fresh green-peas from cinnamon trees, 
Grass-soups and wine was called : 
The pigs did cry, " root hog or die," 
And the cats in chorus maul( d. 
But it soon began to rain. 
The Fair to an end it came; 
The monkey - kissed 
The dohkey's wife, 
The mule he laughed quite plain ; 
The boll-do , lost his tail. 
The grasshopper he turned pale. 
The donkey stabbed the mule with his ear, 
And bung himself to a 
nail. 
"BANTY DAN." 
Banjo Solo by BILLY W EST, 
I 
come from a 
land far over the seas, 
Where oysters and clams grow on apple trees, 
I've gone for tett years without ally rest, 
Trying to find a 
little bird's nest. 
But L 
found only a 
couple of crabs in fits, 
Olt dear oh, Oh dear, oit. 
And a 
gray- headed cockle gone out of his wits, 
On dear oh, dear oh. 
CHORUS. 
So Batty Dan that is my name, 
Front Jersey Flats my Mammy came, 
My Daddy came from Grady's Hills, 
And made all his money by making pills. 
I 
saw an old woman and ugly was she, 
She lived upon matches and very strong tea, 
When I 
told her how wrong such a 
diet must be, 
She stuck up her nose and said let me be. 
She took it poor eat and shaved oil his tail, 
Oh dear oh, Oh my oh— 
For sticking its nose into the milk pail, 
Oa dear, Oh dear oh. 
So Banty Dan, &e. 
I 
saw an old woman who married a 
king, 
She had no finger to put on a 
ring, 
So they bored a 
hole through her nose instead, 
And she said it gave her a 
cold in the head. 
Soto please this fine king \limn she did tear, 
Ott dcar oh, Oh my oh— 
Sic picked herself up and slid off on her ear. 
Oh dear, oh dear oh— 
So Banty Dan, & e. 
I 
saw a 
codfish who could not. wink his eye. 
Though his 1110lail was so big he could not tell why, 
I 
up with my toot. with it kick on his hea I, 
I 
mule him so sick he went fill to his bed. 
They made hint some gruel, but that was enough, 
0.1, dear, olt, oh, my oh— 
It was made out of shoeblacking with plenty of snuff, 
Oa, dear, oh dear oh— 
So Banty Dan ; &e.

Come and kiss me, not for Joe, then I'll see you again. 
My pretty Jane we'll married be, love's secret thou hast.

With the wickedest titan in New York. 
Now this voting girl was just sixteen, 
As gentle as a

With eyes as I

And a

She looked so gay and dressed so neat, 
While walking down the street, 
With Bismark shoes as largo as mine, 
Oh wasn't she a

once used to court a 
nice young girl, 
I'll tell you it all if I 
can. 
She was a 
big rich farmer's daughter, 
And her name it was Mary, Mary Ann, 
treated her to oysters and cabbage. 
Ice Cream, Lemonade and Blanc Mange, 
And she says to me now you're my darling. 
This little girl with the hood on. 
CHORUS. 
For she was the girl for my money, 
She was handsome, genteel, straight and tall, 
She was so bewitchingly charming, 
This little girl with the hood on. 
One evening I_took her to supper, 
I 
placed her right in an arm- chair, 
When her cousin, a 
Frenchman from Limerick, 
Says Mary Ann what are you doing there. 
Says she to him, Oda is my lover, 
Says he, what? that hungry sardine. 
I'll smatch him right straight by the bugle, 
And skin him just like a 
mackareel. 
For she, &e. 
One day Mary Ann was a- milking, 
The cows and the ducks and the deer, 
When her cousin, this big Irish Frenchman, 
Kept pouring love tales hi her ear. 
I 
rushed to the house and I 
seized on 
A great big Dutch Butcher's cheese knife, 
And I 
stabbed him right straight in the wizzi-en 
And that put and end to his life. 
For she, &c.

But she drives my frown off with a

And says, " Father says I

Banjo Solo by BILLY W EST 
I'll sing you a 
song of a 
nice young gal, 
Who lived on Bowery near Canal. 
Her maiden-name was Emma Jane Lee, 
And her father sold clams in the cottage by the sea. 
She was the reigning Belle of this town, 
And she loved a 
Shoemaker named McGoWall, 
McGowan he swore he'd lose his life, 
Or he'd make Matilda Jane his wife. 
One night Matilda went to a 
ball, 
With a 
clam soup man at a 
big dance hall, 
She danced three sets and the fourth to begin, 
When all at once McGowan stepped in. 
He saw his love a—dancing there, 
He raved and swore and tore his hair, 
He oliellanged the clam soup man in the Hall, 
To fight next day with Cod-fish Balls. 
They fought next day 
Catnip Hill, 
McGowan got shot with a 
Mandrake Pill, 
lie rolled in the dirt and then said he. 
Shoo-fly dont you bottler me. 
When Matilda found her love had fell, 
She jumped in a, Barrel of Oyster shells, 
She scratched her shins till the skin came off, 
Then died next with hooping cough.

"EYE WORDS." 
Banjo Solo written by BOBBY NEWCOMB for BILLY W EST. 
Ohl the byewords that now go the rounds 
Are very funny in their way, 
Some they are to music set. 
Others they are heard in the play, 
Conversation is all changed 
Every day there's something new. 
For people talk now-a-days so strange 
And the way its done I'll show to you. 
" 
His Nibs is queer," " I'm fixed," " Get Back," 
•‘ That's where, I 
live," " 
my pie," 
" 
You're my oyster," Don't you drop," 
" 
Walk oft on your ear," " How is that for high," 
" 
There's no use Kicking against hard luck," 
"

THE FELLER IN TUE CIRCuS. 
Written by FRANK D UMONT. 
Sung by BILLY W EST. 
I'll sing of a 
dashing young feller, 
A young man ettitHowo to fame, 
lie threw flip- flaps under a 
canvas, 
Signor Muldoon was his natne. 
He traveled along with a 
cireus 
And played monkey in the side show, 
The most prominent gilt of Dame Nature 
Was his beautiful freckled pug- nose. 
CHORUS. 
And he'd skip o'er the sawdust so lightly 
And stand on the end of his toes. 
He'd climb on the trapeze away up 
And hang by his foreign pug- nose. 
Now there was in the country a 
damsel. 
Mary, Mary Ann was her natne. 
She said she'd love Muldoon forever 
And he said he'd love her the same. 
He'd play with the lions to amuse her, 
On the elephant's trunk he'd repose, 
And throw summersaults by the hundred, 
And jump through his own crimson nose. 
And he'd skip, &c. 
Now Mary Ann was false to her lover, 
For the fellow who tickets did take. 
She cast off Muldoon very shabby, 
And he never got over the shake. 
To die for her Muldoon intended, 
So he packed up all his circus tools. 
And committed suicide, being thrown from 
The back of the comical mules. 
And he'd skip, &c.

With the lythoon's little brother ; 
The skunk and fat mau got mixed so 
You couldn't tell one from tother.

With the turtle and the frog ; 
The hop-toad he got in a

And then chewed up the whale. 
The grasshopper laughed to see the fun 
Then stepped on the rabbit's tail.

Went out upon a

The alligator came rolling. home 
And fell in the bull- frog's bunk ;

The mosquito .got on his dignity, 
And pulverized the mule.

4 PUT ME IN FLY LITTLE BED." 
Words by JERRY COIIEN. 
Sung by BILLY W EST. 
Oh, Birdie, I 
am exceedingly fatigued at this moment, 
do not care for an exhibition of your vocal abilities, 
All day you've displayed them to satisfactory advantage, 
So put your head beneath it's usual feathered protector. 
Ini sleepy too, the approach of slumber is apparent, 
And, Birdie, when my habitual devotions have been dis-
posed of 
I 
want to prostrate my person in the arms of Morpheus. 
So put me in that soothing harbor designated as my vir-
tuous couch. 
CHORUS . 
Come afleetionate feminine relative approach, 
Kiss me with compliments of the hour. 
For I 
my evening devotion have tittered, 
I'm infinitely fatigued and fain would seek repose. 
So put Inc in that resting place designated by the usual 
appellation of my little bed. 
Oh, Birdie, repeat the ejaculations of our maternal pro-
tector, 
When she to the abode of eternal bliss was summoned 
She told me always to assume a 
disposition of amiability, 
And never, never stray from the paths of virtue and pru-
dence. 
ne'er forget the day her spirit departed from its mortal 
casket, 
She placed her digits upon my devoted cranium, 
And whispered softly, retain my obedient offspring. 
And then I 
received information to the effect that she had 
shuffled off this mortal coil. 
Come affectionate, &c. 
RUSTIC DAMSEL. 
Written by W ALTER HOWARD, sang by BILLY W EST. 
A long time to come, I 
remember it well, 
All alone in the workhouse this beauty did dwell. 
With her lather and mother she lived all serene ; 
Her age it was red and her hair was nineteen. 
Now she had a 
lover who close by did dwell, 
A bandy—backed Rustic and hump-backed as well ; 
He said " fly with me now by the light of you star 
For you are the eye of my apple you are." 
But this dutif to maiden said gently " be wise," 
My father should scratch out iny nails with his eyes. 
If you love me so you'll not bring me to disgrace 
Sobbed the maid as she buried her hand in his face. 
So, so she refused him. He knocked down this maid, 
She suddenly opened the knife with his blade, 
lie next cut the throat of this damsel so fair. 
Then dragged her along by the head of the hair. 
Now just at this moment the old man appears. 
And he gazed on the sight with eyes in his tears, 
He knelt down beside her and her cold face he kissed 
Then rushed with his throat at the murderer's fist.

PARODY ON 
FATHER, COME HOME ." 
Written by E. D. GOODING expressly for BILLY WEST. 
Oh Father, dear Father, pedestrianize with me to our domicile, 
The clock in the belfry of the neighboring court- house has just 
pealed out the hour of one. 
You emphatically promised my aged parent to return at once from 
the hash factory 
As soon as you had earned the regfflar sustenance required to sus-
tain the family gang assembled hare. 
The fire disappared just after you did, and kerosene oil is all 
played ; 
And the old dame has been anxious 
fish balls. 
And that little snoozer 
parezoric. 
And there's no one 
since she dished up the cod-
Be: jaruin has been 
to render any assistance 
CHORUS. 
squeeling for more 
but my royal nibs. 
Come home, sherry your nibs, oh daddy, oh head of the family 
Exercise your pedal extremities towards the attic for which 
we pay the rent. 
Oh, author of my being continue your meandering with me to the 
place of our present residence, 
For that mammoth time- piece with the aid of bell-metal has just 
belched out two. 
The shanty is colder than any skating rink and fat Benjamin has 
got the jim-jams. 
And he has expressed a 
desire to behold his aged parent as soon 
as convenient. 
I'm sure he's got the delirium triangles, and mother says he's go-
ing to peg out, 
And that before the bright Aurora again gilds the eastern horizon.

PARODY ON FATHER, &c.—CONCLUDED. 
And this is the verbal communication she wished me to convey to 
the author of her misfortunes, 
Oh daddy, turn your back on the door, and greet my mother with 
Sour detestable presence. 
CHORUS. 
Proceed thitherward, come to your roost, please papy, dear papy, 
On my bentled knees I 
implore kind Providence to aid you to 
reach your domicile. 
Oh Father, you old snoozer, can't you leave this lot of bummers 
and come with me to our tenement, 
That monitor that calls the eight hour men to their labor in the 
morning, has just sung out three, 
The house is as lonesoine as a 
Quaker meeting, the hours as long 
as the President's message. 
For the old woman with tears running down her cheeks ( since 
she eat the onions) and your humble servant. 
Yes we are in complete solitude, and that Benjamin has banded in 
his checks, 
And gone with that gang of little Ariel flutterers with wings on 
their shoulders. 
And this was the last remark escaped his lips ere he fell overboard, 
I 
want to kiss the old man and smell his breath once more before 
I'm folded in the embrace of Morpheus.

Come home, join your disconsolate family, oh Father, dear 
Father. 
They've tumbled to your racket and nobody will throw a 
ball 
in you, so you'd better come home. 
LAST cut:mt.:8. 
Hear the dulcet silver toned warblings of your precious kid, 
As they float on the breeze, and echo answers from the other side: 
of the alley way. 
Oh who can resist the plaintive and touching poetical effusions 
I've flung at you. 
Old snoozer, old roustabout, if you don't go, I'll call the cop and 
make him put a 
head on you.

The day it passed, the evening came, 
While sitting down to tea, 
A

And singing merrily.— Cho. 
It shines on man and woman, 
It shines on cattle too: 
But most I

It shines on all of you: 
It shines on houses, and on lands,

How pleasant of a 
sunny day, 
When the sky it looks so blue.— Co.

WOMAN'S RIGHTS. 
Banjo Solo sung by BILLY W EST. 
Good evening. folks, Pm glad to see you all, 
But please don't think me rude, 
But let me say, like finned Paul Pry, 
I 
hope I 
don't intrude. 
I 
just dropped in by accident, 
Like all the other nights 
To tell you all I 
know and think, 
About the woman's rights. 
Some women want to be President, 
Others Secretary of ilie State, 
But they all want to grab at the treasury 
That's a 
chance I'd like to take. 
They want to hold the Post Office 
The reason I'll unfurl. 
They want to catch those fellows writing notes 
To all the other girls. 
Now I 
go in for Woman's Rights, 
And what I 
say is true. 
I'd like the women to net. like men 
And the men as women do. 
For I 
think to give the women their rights 
Would give us no distress 
For the women then could do all the work 
And the men wear all the fine dress. 
The women scandalize the men, 
And make such a 
fuss `about them, 
But I'd like the women to tell me 
What they could do without them. 
Although the men will run around, 
Drink Lager and carouse, 
The women find them mighty handy things 
To have about the house.

WHAT RIGHT HAS A 
AN TO BE POOR. 
Written by J. F. POOLE. 
Sung by BILLY W EST. 
I'm going to sing a new ditty: 
You will say there is truth in my rhyme. 
Where ever you go through the city— 
That poverty's counted a 
crime, 
A man may be worthy and honest, 
Yet his conduct we cannot endure 
For while Riches alone People worship, 
What right has a man to be poor. 
One day as I 
went omit a- walking, 
" 
Stop thief I" I 
heard somebody cry_ 
Amongst the crowd that began to assemble 
Was a 
fop with a glass to his eye. 
At a 
poor workingman there he pointed, 
Saying that ruffian you'd better secure, 
That he is the thief I 
assure you 
He must be because he's so poor. 
Tother day on a 
steamboat excursion, 
A young lady fell over-board 
A poor man jumped atter to save her, 
While her parents in agony roared. 
When safe in his arms he brought. her, 
Say's her father, I 
thank you, Fin sure ; 
But you'll please to leave go of my daughter, 
To embrace her, young man, you're to poor. 
When war cast a 
cloud o'er our nation 
And liberty's call did resound; 
how many kid gloved wearing gentry 
In the ranks of our soldiers were found. 
The first 
to march off was the toiler, 
Our Union and rights to secure; 
When our Banner was saved from the spoiler 
The fighting men came from the poor.

Oh Willie, black-eyed William, do I 
once more cast my 
lamps on you sate, safe at home. 
They did not inform me correctly William, when they 
told me you would not appear in proper person. 
I 
heard you sliding on the cellar door, Billy, and it 
made my heart go bump- it-y 
bump. 
Fof I 
recognized the print of your No. 11 ill the sand, 
and your voice that sounds like filing saws, 
Making horrible discords on my— the only time the 
screech-owl belches forth his melody. 
Oh William we have a 
vacant chair at the hash board, 
and I'm glad you've come home to eat the stale 
[pieces of pie. 
We've waited for you anxiously since you ran away to 
Canada to get out of the draft. 
I 
used fifteen cents worth of coal the first four weeks 
you were gone. keeping fires for you nights. 
The kids sat up so late watching for you ' till Dickie fell 
asleep and fell in the fire-place. 
And the peepers of the other eleven young ones closed. 
and seven of 'em crawled under the bed to sleep. 
But I'm as happy as a Coney Island clam, for I was 
afraid you were mixed up with the Credit Mo-
[biller, and disgrace us figs. 
Oh William embrace me in those arms that've white-
washed many a 
ceiling, and welcome to our brown

"ONLY JOKING." 
Written by BOBBY NEWCOMB expressly for BILLY W EST. 
Some people they have funny ways 
In talking, walking, or in thinking; 
Some they like to Billiards play 
While others pass their time in drinking. 
But the man who is the worst of all. 
Who takes in life as nice as smoking, 
Helps himself to all he gets. 
Then tells you he was only joking. 
The other day I 
met a 
friend, 
And stopped to talk a 
little while; 
For I 
was dressed up in my best 
With a 
nice plug hat in the latest style. 
When all at once he mashed my hat. 
Down on my ears, I 
felt like choking. 
When I 
got mad the excuse he had 
Was, " Billy, I 
was only joking." 
A pretty girl I 
went to see. 
And really thought that I 
would wed her 
To all the theaters we did go 
On the best Ice Cream I 
always fed her, 
loaned to her my diamond ring, 
My friends their fun are at me poking. 
She ran away with a 
chap next day, 
"Iwas a 
way she had of only joking. 
The other day I 
took a 
stroll, 
Towards the river I 
did travel. 
When just as I 
stood on the wharf. 
Who should I 
meet but my friend " Farrell" 
Hallo. old boy, he slapped my back, 
In the river I 
fell and got a 
soaking, 
And when they pulled me out half drowned 
He said that he was only joking, 
A little fun is very well— 
They say laugking makes you fat. 
Therefore I 
mustn't mind my \vetting 
Or the diamond ring and my silk hat. 
So when you hear my little puns, 
Like Grant you must keep on a 
smoking 
And when you see me here again 
trust you'll find me '• only joking."

But she didn't care a 
rap for Pat, for she loved another

BUFFALO. 
Written by Ned Harrigan. 
Sung by BILLY W 
EST. 
From Buffalo I've just come down 
On the good boat Danger; 
A long, long trip on the Erie, boys, 
I 
feel just like a 
stranger. 
We'd heavy fogs, and awful storms, 
Forget ' em I 
never shall ; 
I'm every inch a 
sailor boy, 
On the E-ri-e 
We were loaded down with barley, 
When we Lid good bye : 
When a 
pirate bore upon its, 
With an awful wicked eye. 
I 
saw him through the spy-glass, 
I 
put lip a 
flag of truce ; 
I 
found it was the Three Sisters, 
Four days from Syracuse. 
Three days' out we struck a 
rock, 
Of Lackawana coal ; 
It gave the boat an awful shock, 
And stove in quite a 
hole. 
I 
halloed to the driver. 
On the tow -path's treaden dirt ; 
He came ab ,ard and sapped the leak, 
With his flannel undershirt. 
In two years we reached the Hudson, 
We hadn't slept a 
wink ; 
The crew mutinized 
Because I 
ref;Ned a 
drink. 
Keep up your courage. then I 
cried, 
I'll bring you safely in ; 
And when we strike a 
grocery store, 
We'll swim in barrels of gin. 
The storm went down, we went ashore, 
Me and Sal and Hank ; 
Greased ourselves with tallow- fat, 
And slid out on a 
plank. 
Sal is in the Poor House, toys, 
The crew are all in jail; 
I'm the only sole surviving mole, 
Left to tell the tale. 
Spoken.— So Haul in your bow- line, 
Stand by your sorrel mule, 
Low bridge, boys, dodge your heads; 
Don't act just like a 
fool. 
C110 RES. 
For the Erie is a 
rising, 
And the gin is getting low : 
I 
hardly think you'll get a 
drink, 
Till we go back to Buffalo.

POETICAL HASH . 
Banjo Solo. 
Sung by BILLY W EST. 
White folks, listen to me. while I 
sing to you a 
song, 
It isn't a 
very short one, nor it isn't very long. 
And when you've heard my story, I 
haven't any doubt, 
'Twill make you inelaneholy when you know what it's about. 
My father was a 
carpenter, for which I 
am not to blame, 
And when I 
think of mother dear, the tears fall like the rain 
From Greenland's Icy Mountains, to the Gulf of Mexico. 
Blow you Winds of Morning, blow, blow, blow. 
.koross the stormy, briny sea, along the sea-girt shore, 
Where many a 
gallant bark is lost, and the splashing waves do 
roar. 
An Indian Maiden on the Lake, she paddles her own canoe, 
With an Indian rubber overcoat,—a 
hoop de dooden doo. 
Young Henry was far out to sea, as you may understand, 
He took his pocket handkerchief and waved it in his hand. 
She gave three shrieks for Henry, and then began to cry. 
Will you walk into the garden, said the spider to the fly. 
At the foot of yonder mountain, there flows a 
limpid stream, 
'Mid the fairest of Palaces that ever yet was seen. 
Young Mary laid her down to rest, and loudly she did shout, 
Good morning, Mr. Jenkins, does your mother know you're out. 
With a 
Moral. 
Come all you men and maidens, wherever you may be, 
Never leave your humble cot to cross the raging sea. 
Think of the fate of Hoary, who from his love did lay, 
With a 
big- a-pig— a 
little pig—a 
root— a 
hog— or die.

BANJO SOLO—' COXING THRO' 
THE RYE," 
Sung by BILLY W EST. 
There once did live, as folks do now, 
A 
young girl sweet and pretty, 
And the maiden's name was Miss Sop Chow 
And dwelt in Changhai City. 
She had a 
lover fond and true 
With a 
goggle-eyed expression ; 
In the land of flowers was called Cluing Foo 
And a 
Cobbler by profession. 
CHORUS. 
With a 
Cluing, Cluing Cluing, and a 
Foo, Foo, Foo, 
And a 
Cobbler's kit together. 
And his motto was, I 
will be true 
To Miss Sop Chow and leather. 
Now Cluing Foo one day to Sop Chow said, 
roam this world all over, 
And when I'm rich we'll be warded 
And then we'll live in clover. 
Then to Massachusetts Cluing Foo did stray 
Where Adams makes progression, 
And in his Shoe Shop brought up one day 
A 
Cobbler by profession. 
With a 
Cluing, &c. 
:Nov the brave Ching Foo worked night and day 
Without regard to weather, 
Be-ddes he had no board to pay, 
For he lived on scraps of leather. 
He got choked one day on the sole of a 
shoe, 
And death stopped all progression— 
And that was the last of brave Cluing Foo, 
A Cobbler by profession. 
'With a 
Chiog. & c.

Old Mother Hubbard she went to the cupboard 
r10 save her poor dog's health, 
Mary said to her little lamb, 
You know how it is yourself. 
The boy that would a- wooing go 
Was in the cold ground laid. 
Oh, Johnny, I 
hardly knew you since 
You joined the free lunch Brigade. 
Champagne Charley is rny name, 
While rolling home ill the morn, 
Maggie sitting .by my side 
I 
tell you den I 
was gone. 
Oh put me in my little bed 
I 
just want forty winks, 
rm lonely since my mother died 
And so is Captain Jinks. 
The forty thieves have stolen my heart, 
Musquitos stung my ear, 
The soldier leaned upon his sword 
Then wiped away a 
tear, 
On the Beach at Long Branch 
I 
walked with bonny Jean 
They were hangiuq.u: frogs in Canada 
For the wearing of the green. 
Hark I 
hear an angel Si mug 
A-coming through the rye, 
Mother may I 
go to swim 
To root hog or die. 
The spider coaxed the little fly, 
His royal nibs felt queer, 
Trying to see the new Post Office. 
Then walked oft on his ear.

Wid needles, hooks and pin ;

PARODY ON " 
WHEN THE CORN IS WAVING, 
ANNIE DEAR." 
Written by Nn HA RRIGAN, for BILLY W EST. 
When the corn is ten cents a 
bushel, and the bunions is painful, 
Annie dear, 
I'll meet you in a 
beer garden, where the liquid is quoted finan-
cially at five cents a 
bowl. 
To hear thy voice in stentorian tones, articulate to the Teutonic 
proprietor to accept your contributions for beer, 
And sit contentedly until the still vapors of the beverage permit 
us in the gutter to roll. 
And when the moon in it's celestial hemisphere betokens individ-
ually that we're full, love, 
The stars with their metropolitan accoutrements, will signify 
their approbation by reques•ing us to git. 
Oh come and emigrate, or else my affection will diminish to that 
abbreviation of that coloquial syllable eloqutionized as quit. 
CRORUS. 
When the corn is waving, Annie dear, 
Oh meet me by the stile ; 
To hear thy gentle voice again, 
And greet thy willing smile. 
When the corn is dispensated by the sable daughter of Africa, 
spontaneous to her auditors, Annie dear, 
Our taies of love with exhilerating chin music we'll convey for per-
sonal aggrandizement to our aristocratic selves. 
Beside the pawnbroker's officially presided over by Mr. Simpson, 
whose cognomen is familiar to your aural appendage called 
[ear. 
Where both of us have garments which formerly protected us from 
the beautiful snow, now arranged alphabetically on the upper 
[shelves. 
To Blackwell's Island where flowers blush and bloom, we'll go, 
love, 
In a 
chariot christened Maria in close proximity to the horse's 
tail. 
Oh haste, Postilion, for my constitutional debility demonstrates 
the fact, I 
require a 
ten days' lay out in jail. 
CHORU S. 
When the corn is waving, Annie dgar 
Oh meet me by the stile ; 
To hear thy gentle voice again, 
And greet thy willing smile.

BANJO SOLO," FLYING TRAPEZE." 
Written by JERRY COHEN. 
Sung by BILLY W EST. 
Once I possessed happiness, but now I am infinitely 
wetched, 
Comparing favorably with an outer garment considerably 
dilapidated, 
Isolated in 
this merciless sphere must I 
drag out a 
mis-
erable existence, 
Betrayed by a 
virgin of youthful inexperience, 
The aforesaid damsel was exceedingly beautiful. 
displiyed every conceivable effort energetically, 
But my efforts were unrewarded as her affections were 
preoccupied. 
By an athletic youth of unquestionably gymnastic ability. 
CHORUS. 
Oh he precipitated his person through the atmosphere 
with apparent indifference 
This daring individual on his zampilacrostation 
His posende appolo were relished by his female admirers, 
And the object of my affections he purloined. 
Once during my perigrinations I 
presented myself at her 
residence 
And discovered her parents in greivons isolations, 
I was informed on inquiring as to the cause of their 
bereavemen t 
That their 
disobedient, yet 
beautiful 
offspring, 
had 
vamoosed. 
She collected her 
necessary apparel and departed in 
obscure darkness 
With him without the remotest hesitation. 
From an exceedingly lofty eminence he assisted her to 
descend her pe ,lal extremities, 
Alighting on Terra Firma with visions of aerial. 
CHORUS. 
I 
shall never see my love again for she has gone away, 
She's gone to B-Iackwell's island a 
couple of months for 
to stay, 
And when her time expires, how happy I 
shall be, 
For my poor Bet:=y Baker.

GET 4 UP AND GIT. 
Written by FRANK DnIONT, expressly for BILLY W EST. 
Air: " Old Knives to grind." 
Strange that our language should be butchered up so, 
You'll hear new expressions wherever you go. 
Ask a 
friend for a 
favor and he shows you his wit, 
By smiling and saying, Oh get up and git. 
Ask a 
friend for a 
favor and he'll show you his wit 
And tell you to get up and git. 
You'll go out some evening to see your true love, 
She whispers so gently, Old dad is above. 
You kiss her so often she don't mind it a 
bit. 
'Til her father's boot tells you to get up and git, 
He kicks you so hard you ain't able to sit, 
It's time then to get up and git. 
History tells us that John Bull came out here. 
He thought that Patriots would tremble with fear. 
At York' own and Bunker Hill, John had a 
bad fit, 
For Washington advised him to get up and git. 
They found that old Jackson had the right kind of grit 
For he nit:de them all get up and git. 
Spoken: " 1811" 
Some more I 
could tell you but some other night, 
I 
suppose you are tired so I'll get out of sight, 
If I've amused you I'll consider it a 
hit 
Take up the Banjo and get up and git. 
Take up the Banjo and the premises quit 
It's high time to get up and git.

C3RK ON THE BRAIN. 
Written by FRANK DEMONT expressly for BILLY W EST. 
Ant :—" Hail Columbia right side up side." 
I 
once did love a 
fickle damsel, 
And I 
thought that she loved me; 
But soon I 
found that it was folly, 
For both of us could not agree. 
The way I 
lost her, now I'll tell you, 
How I 
came to lose her hand ; 
I 
took her to see a 
minstrel concert, 
And she fell Move with one of the band. 
CHORUS. 
If she loved me I'd be happy, 
She might have been a 
lady grand ; 
But, she better loved the big bass singer, 
Who sat in the middle of a 
Minstrel Band. 
He'd give her tickets for the concert, 
And she'd sit in the front row ; 
And in a 
hnrry then he'd " wash up," 
And hasten out, then home they'd go. 
He'd sing the " Old Sexton " for to please her, 
And at the low notes she would stare ; 
While I 
distracted on the sidewalk, 
Raved and swore and tore my hair. 
If she loved me, &c. 
So back my pictures then she gave me, 
And told me ne'er to show my face ; 
Or dare to think that I 
could win her, 
Until I 
learned to warble bass. 
I 
left her and in the " Clipper " lately 
I 
read that she was shuffling sand ; 
And travelling as a 
lady cloggist, 
With a 
Female Minstrel Band. 
If she loved me, &e.

The doctors say we must not drink, 
And I 
suppose they know. 
The preachers tell us one and all 
To keep away from shows. 
I too will give you my advice, 
Although not fond of lip. 
Go where you will, drink what you like, 
But never lose your grip. 
It's about a 
hundred years ago 
Since first our Sires uprose, 
In ragged clothes they marched and fought 
Barefooted through the snows 
Their leader was George Washington 
Who made the English ship. 
No matter where he met the foe 
lie never lost his grip. 
And latter, in these times of ours, 
Another man was found 
Who in time rigging lashed himself 
When shot and shell 
flew ' round, 
You all know Admiral Farragut. 
The Hartford was his ship. 
And in the fight at Mobile Bay 
He never lost his grip. 
There's one thing more 
going to say 
Before I am quite get through. 
Success to old Ireland 
And little Cuba, too. 
And they will yet be free, my boys, 
From the oppressor's whip. 
For the people are the kind, my boys, 
Who never lose their grip.

THE RED-HEADED GAL 
Sung by BILLY W EST. 
I'll sing to you of a 
red-Ile:Wed gal who lived in this Town. 
She was the Boss Waiter in a 
big Hotel 
That was kept by a 
man named Brown. 
She had carrotty red eyes and pink blue hair, 
And th'ey called her Bungo Sal. 
And she tell in love with a 
Captain with the whiskers 
Who ran on the raging Canal. 
lie courted her with all his might and loved her full well 
And treated his darling every nip-,
ht. 
To pea- nuts on tie half shell. 
He took her out to ride one day, 
Ms darling Bungo Sal. 
When the mule got the toothache and pitched them in 
The middle of the raging Canal. 
But the Captain he proved false to 
her, his darling 
Bungo Sal. 
And she met him one day in his Sunday clothes. 
In company wish a 
tin- ware gal. 
When Sally found her love was false 
It nearly broke her heart, 
And she scabbed herself one very fine day 
With the shell of a Crab Apple Tart. 
Now the 
tin ware gal went crazy then 
Tore her hair and wrung her hands. 
And drowned herself in self defence 
In one of the large dish- pans, 
And the Captain with the whiskers distracted went 
And since has never been seen, 
So he cut off his whiskers and died with the croup, 
For the wearing of the green.

A TRIP TO CALIFORNIA. 
Sung by BILLY W EST. 
I've just got back from the land of gold, 
And 
tell you about my journey, 
I 
crossed the Plains as a 
traveller bold 
On the road to California. 
A Chinaman was the first I 
saw— 
Riding on a 
donkey, 
Then an Injin and a 
great big squaw 
With a 
pappoose like a 
monkey. 
CHORUS. 
I've just got back from the land of gold, 
And I'll tell you about my journey. 
I 
crossed the plains as a 
traveller bold 
On the road to California. 
I 
saw a 
man with a 
drum and fife, 
And an eye like Booth's jago, 
He was looking for his runaway wife, 
Who had left him in Chicago, 
Then came a 
woman most strange to see 
She was neither fair nor hearty, 
But she hailed she said from Milwankie, 
And belonged to the woman's right party. 
l've just &c. 
I 
saw a 
man with a 
foreign air, 
He said his name was Stingy, 
He had gooseberry eyes and short red hair 
And came from old New Jersey. 
Then an Empire boy just hove in sight 
A gallons chap anti pretty, 
I'm spoiling he said to have a 
fight, 
For I'm just from New York City. 
I've just, &c. 
But the strangest sight that I 
did see 
That filled me most with wonder, 
Besides it looked so queer to me 
It made me laugh like thunder. 
It was a 
Revenue man collecting tax 
With eyes like pickled onions. 
And his ears were like two big flat jacks, 
And nose all covered with bunions. 
I've just du'.

Sung by BILLY W EST. 
Oh, I'm lonely to-night, love, without you, 
And I 
sigh for one glance of your ear. 
Oh, sure there's a 
charm, love, about you, 
You never go back on your beer, 
I met you out walking last Sunday, 
Deny it you can't, Miss O'Neil, 
I 
loaned you a 
nice dollar Greenback, 
To get your stockings half soled and heeled. 
Oh ! the nightingale sings in the kitchen, 
But it can't sing a 
good song and dance. 
I'd sooner hear your sweet voice ringing 
Down at the Beach at Long Branch. 
My father Sold charcoal on Sunday— 
The Policeman he then took him in— 
My name it is Paddy McFadden 
And that's where the laugh comes in. 
Oh, Nora, sweet Nora O'Neil, 
You can't tell how sick I have been, 
I 
went out with Jenny McLaughlin, 
And got drunk as an owl on Benzine. 
I 
think, love, so often about you, 
But I 
dont think you love me a 
bit, 
So give me your gold watch and chain, love. 
And then I 
will get up and git.
