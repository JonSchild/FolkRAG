I 
have an old companion, Joint Riley from Tralee, 
In fair or cloudy weather, John Riley's seen with me; 
His heart is like a 
mountain, his honor ye can't bay, 
But elbow bending is his fault, John Riley's always dry. 
CuoRus. 
Bass' ale by the pail 
He would order Rosanna to go out and buy, 
Dublin Stout he would shout, 
Keep drinking and never say die. 
Whisky prime, gin and wine, 
He would hand down a 
bottle and merrily cry, 
My Rose Atm fill the can, 
For honest Joint Riley's dry. 
It's every morning early John Riley's out of bed, 
Sure never a 
feather bolster lies under Riley's head; 
It's when the sun is rising, so eager and so sly, 
lie slips out for his bitters, boys, John Riley's always dry. 
Bass' ale, etc. 
His father often told him when John was but a 
youth, 
That every mortal Riley all died front whisky drouth; 
Of course it is a 
failing, the poor man can't deny, 
'Tis but a 
freak of nature, boys, John Riley's always dry. 
Bass' ale, etc. 
What puzzles all the doctors John Riley's ever met, 
Is fresh or salty water can't make John Riley wet; 
Sure he must have the liquor, rum, brandy, gin or rye, 
And should he miss the bottle, boys, John Riley'd surely die. 
Bass' ale, etc.

'Twas shortly after marriage, full of love and joy, 
I 
bought a 
baby carriage for a 
dumpling of a 
boy; 
Oh, ev'ry Sunday morning my wife ' lid fret and pout, 
Till I'd put on my linen suit, and wheel the baby out. 
CHORUS. 
Then nobly, and proudly, happy as a 
lord, 
I 
wheel the baby round. the block, the envy of the 
ward; 
Stately and softly, merrily along, I'd push the baby 
-boys, and sing this little song: 
Oh, heigh, diddle, diddle, the cat's in the fiddle; 
flow are you, Mr. Mulligan? you hear the neighbors . 
shout! 
The little dog laugh'd for to see such funny sport, 
I 
always was a singing when I'd wheel the baby out. 
There's jealous Mister Higgins, just next door to me, 
Himself and Misses Higgins have no children, do ye 
see; 
He stands upon the doorstep, and turns his back 
about, 
He never had the luck, my boys, to wheel the baby 
out. 
Cnonus. 
Then nobly, and proudly, happy as a 
lord, 
I 
wheel the baby round' the block, the envy of the 
ward ; 
Stately and softly, merrily along, I'd push the baby 
carriage, boys, and sing this little song: 
Oh, goosey, goosey, gander, ' twas where shall I 
wander; 
How are you, Mister Mulligan? you hear the - neigh-
bors shout! 
It's up the stairs, and down stairs, all in the ladies' 
chamber, 
I 
always was a 
singing when I'd wheel the baby out. 
(Continued.) 
The old maiden spinster, just across the way, 
She tittivates her poodle, white, with ribbons bright 
and gay; 
-While looking from her window, she said she had a 
doubt, 
Oh, if it was the proper thing to wheel the baby out. 
CHORUS. 
Then nobly, and proudly, happy as a 
lord, 
I 
wheel the baby round the block, the envy of the 
ward; 
Stately and softly, merrily along, 
I'd push the baby carriage, boys, and sing this little 
song: 
There's old Mother Hubbard, she went to the cup-
board; 
How are you, Mister Mulligan? you hear the neigh-
bors shout! 
Oh, when she got there, the cupboard it was bare, 
I 
always was a 
singing when I'd wheel the baby out. 
Now, all ye merry bachlors, when your fortune's 
made. 
Oh, ft•et a 
wife and wagon, and go out upon parade; 
Now ornament the nation, when war it comes about, 
You've done your duty faithfully, to wheel a soldier 
out. 
CHORUS. 
Then nobly and proudly, happy as a 
lord, 
I 
wheel the baby round the block, the envy of the 
ward ; 
Stately and softly, merrily along. I'd push the baby 
carriage, boys, and sing this little song: 
There's poor Johnny Horner, that sat in the corner; 
How are you, Mister Mulligan? you hear the neigh-
bors shout! 
Put in his little thumb, and he pulled out a plum,. 
I 
always was a 
singing when I'd wheel the baby out.

I 
parted with my Susan Jane, 
I 
gave her substantial advice, 
She said, don't you think I 
am lovely? 
I 
answered. I 
thought she was nice; 
Just standing in front of the mirror, 
She said, I'm a 
sweet looking lass; 
If you wish to see what a 
beauty I 
be, 
Oh, please, come look in the glass. 
CHORUS. 
The mirror's the cause of it all, 
It hung in a 
frame on the wall, 
She'd stand up before it, and really adore it, 
Saying. Charley, now turn up the gas; 
'Twas awfully awkward for inc 
To court in the light, don't you see 
She said, ain't I 
tall, don't sit near the wall, 
But, com,
.. over and look in the glass. 
Whenever I 
called upon Jane, 
Quite full of ambition and hope, 
I 
seat myself down by her side, and 
At once she'd suddenly slope. 
To fix up her bangs by the mirror, 
She'd sigh, and she'd say, oh, alas! 
If you ‘vish to see the nice dimple in me, 
Oh, please, come look in the glass. 
The mirror's, etc. 
I 
took her one night to the play, 
She had on a 
beautiful hat. 
The curtain went up, and she went out, 
It caused me to look very fiat; 
Escorting her out through the audience, 
To the usher, she said, let me pass! 
Sit down, they hollered, but S1161111 I followed, 
To find a 
large looking glass. 
The inirror- , 
Superstition it crept upon time, 
I 
heard of an accident rare. 
It happened when my Susan Jane was 
A fuzzing and curling her hair. 
The mirror fell down, to lily horror 
It lay in a 
terrible mass; 
So now, I 
see, ' twas a 
warning- tc me, 
I 
shook my Sue and the glass.

On the good ship Polly 1)orkins, front London I 
set 
sail, 
All bound for the Indian Ocean, oh, hear my mourn-

In a 
hurricane of wind and rain, brave boys, we were

With a hay, hay, hay, and a 
ho, ho, ho! 
ne'er forget that day; 
When the whole ship's crew, and the captain too, 
Brave boys, we were east away. 
We'd a 
cask or two of water stowed in the old ship's 
boat; 
A box of old sea biscuits, by chance we found afloat; 
All tempest toss'd, with compass lost, we had no thrte 
to pray; 
Our flag of distress, was a

With a

Afloat on the Indian Ocean, through fair and foul 
and calm, 
I 
saw as the sun was rising, an island full of palm; 
Ho, land! I 
cried, I 
never lied, says Captain, where 
away? 
On our starboard bow, we're safe, lads, now, hip, 
hurrah, for the castaway ! 
Says the Captain, do your duty, all hands when you're

I'm going down to Rahway, 
Was the words I 
said to Nell, 
My beau she was, but, now, alas, 
I've bid my love farewell; 
Be careful, dear, she sweetly said, 
Then pressed her lips to mine; 
Just one embrace, then l'd to race, 
The train left sharp at nine. 
Ctionus. 
Don't you miss the train, love, 
Don't you miss the train! 
Of course I 
know that you mr.st got

Oh, don't you miss the train, love, 
Don't you miss the train! 
You cannot stay, so don't delay, 
Or else you'll miss the train. 
I 
started for the depot, 
But I 
missed the ferry boat, 
I 
ran against a negro man, 
Who whitewashed my new coat, 
We had a lengthy argument, 
upon the right of way; 
The whistle blew, I 
quickly flew, 
To me he then did say: 
Cnonus. 
Hope you miss the train, sir, 
Hope you miss the train! 
There goes the bell, I'll warm you Nxell 
When I 
see you again; 
I 
hope you miss the train, sir, 
hope you miss the train! 
You're too bran new, a 
man like you 
Am sure to miss the train. 
(Concluded.) 
I 
rushed into the depot, 
With one second left to spare, 
Oh, I 
was filled with rage and fright, 
No train or baggage there; 
I 
seized the agent by the arm, 
Said, ain't this very fine? 
You've made an alteration, sir, 
She left ahead of time! 
CHORUS. 
Now you've missed the train, sir, 
Now you've missed the train! 
Don't stay behind. you'll surely find, 
It goes against the grain; 
Oh, now you've missed the train, sir,

I 
moved my family, beds and board last year the first of May, 
From a 
very quiet neighborhood— sure Dan coaxed me away. 
Hypocrisy and scandal, they have caused me bitter woe, 
Vver since the morning I 
moved down to Gossip Row. 
CHORUS. 
Good- morning, Misses Dooley-, 
oh, have you heard the news? 
Mary Ann went to a 
ball and borrowed Peggy's shoes; 
There's a 
second-hand piano in twenty-two, below, 
Nnd lots of drunken boarders in that house in Gossip Row. 
Now listen, Misses Crowley, I've something for your ear— 
What is it 
oh, what is it? 
We are dying for to hear. 
The brunette, Julia Dempsey, I'm told she has a 
beau; 
.3he ran off wid a 
soldier from that house in Gossip Row. 
I 
wear my new-made bonnet, I 
walk along the block; 
They poke their heads from windows and whisper, " What a 
shock 
3he thinks she is a 
young school-girl; ain't she a 
horrid show?" 
You'd have to run a 
gantlet if you moved to Gossip Row. 
CUORCS. 
Good-morning, Misses Dooley, and did you have your tay? 
I 
drank a 
pint of lagerbeer just now wid Misses Fay, 
She wants to be a 
Yankee, I'll lei:. the neighbors know 
She lived in Mulligan Alley 'fore she moved to Gossip Row. 
Now listen, Misses Crowley, I 
never like to speak— 
Who throws out the garbage every Sunday in the week? 
Sure I 
could tell you easy, go on, we want to know. 
'Tis Mrs. Lynch, ah, ha, ah, ha i 
that lives in Gossip Row. 
They borrowed all my kindling wood, and dove into my- coal, 
They broke up all my crockery, 'cept one old sugar- bowl. 
Dan's overcoat, my sealskin sacque. I 
needed for the snow, 
Was stole from off the clothes line from the yard in Gossip .1.ton. 
Cnoaus. 
Now listen, Misses Crowley, I 
went to Coney Isle; 
Your old man wasn't home till six, you flirted there awhile. 
I 
met a 
German bugler, yes, yes, we want to know. 
He ate chains wid a 
lady that's well known in Gossip Row. 
Oh, dear mel Misses Crowley -, 
won't you take a 
chair? 
I'm told that Misses Coogan, she is dyeing up her hair. 
Her little daughter, Dalia, she sent off to Bor'do, 
To learn the parly-vov-vw for the French in Gossip Row.

As sung by TONY HART with great success at Harrigan & Hart's 
Theatre Comique, 514 Broadway, N. Y. 
Oh, the rose of Kentucky and me, 
Long ago old massa set us free; 
I'll tell you what did happen in her good old mother's 
cabin 
To the rose of Kentucky and me. 
On the banks of the Ohio River, 
Where the winters are so cold the darkies shiver; 
One night about eight, we joined the married state, 
The rose of Kentucky and me. 
CHORUS. 
On the banks of the river, that old muddy river, 
She lived on the banks of the river; 
And one nigltt about we joined the married state, 
The rose of Kentucky and inc. 
When they tried to win my rose away from me, 
My wife alone she said she'd be; 
Yet their vanity she flattered, and their hearts she al-
ways shattered, 
When they tried to play that game on me, you see. 
Her voice filled this (turkey full of glee, 
She's as merry and as busy as a 
bee; 
I 
love when I 
look at her, she's black, but that's no 
matter. 
She's just the shade I'd have my darling be. 
On the oanks, etc. 
Since T 
took Kentucky Rose for my wife, 
We have lived together, free from care or strife; 
And it's natural to suppose, we had a 
little Rose, 
For so sweetly flowed the summer of our life. 
Yet the winter of our days will conic, alas! 
-When spring, summer and autumn, too, will pass; 
Hand in hand we'll glide away, and 1'11 bless the hap-
py day 
When I 
took Kentucky Rose for my wife.

My name is O'Brien from Harlem, 
An Irishman as you can see. 
I 
can sing like a 
thrush or a 
star-ling, 
Or the little bird up in a 
tree. 
But the gang that stands there on the corner, 
Are trying the steps and the dance, 
And they shout out whenever I'm passing, 
There's O'Brien with his high water pants. 
CHORUS. 
They tell me to go over to England, 
And to pay a 
short visit to France, 
And there to bring out my new fashions, 
And call them the high water pants. 
Last week I 
went to the theatre, 
Along with my first cousin Dan, 
We hired a 
seat down in the parquette, 
Behind the big man in the band. 
-When a 
nager came out with a 
banjo, 
lie played up a 
high-land clog dance . 
And he gave out a 
gag and conuindrum, 
'Bout O'Brien with his high water pants. 
They tell me, etc. 
One night as I 
strolled down the Bowery, 
Along with a 
friend, Paddy Brock, 
We thot' we'd just drop into Geoghegan's, 
To try some of his rye arid rock. 
When the gang all cried there's Dan O'Leary, 
The bar-tender shot me a 
glance, 
"1-lowld your tongues," then said he to the loafers, 
That's O'Brien with his high water pants.

There's a

With her eyes of blue, so sweet and truer 
And heart so free; 
Many hours, and the flowers, 
Do I

If she's true to me? 
If I'm any, of the many— 
Will she constant tie? 
None completer, none is sweeter 
In this world of ours; 
Sallie Horner, round the corner, 
In her home of flowers. 
You'll discover how to love her 
If you only try; 
You'll be given gleams of heaven 
If you catch her eye; 
Like the stars that gleam and glisten 
In the azure sky, 
When she speaks the angels listen 
As they pass her by. 
Now I

She is very sly and merry • 
In her rogueish way; 
I

SARAH BARNYARD. 
By the DOCKSTADERS. 
She came here from Paree, 
Her first name is Saree, 
In this land I 
am told she's the rage; 
She has thousands entranced, 
Since she came here from France, 
'Deed you ought to see Sal on the stage; 
She can jabber in French, 
Talk a 
gate off a 
fence, 
When I 
saw her act I 
turned my head; 
It would a 
man steal, 
To see her play Camille, 
She's a 
darling but her hair is red. 
CHORITS 
Sarah, Miss Sarah, you might have been fairer. 
You've been to this city, you ain't a 
bit pretty; 
I'm tc.',1d you are tony, but goodness you're bony 
You've got the folks crazy, Miss Sarah. 
Miss Sarah ain't fat, 
But she wears a 
big hat, 
And long gloves pulled way up to her chin; 
She dresses in fashion, 
She's never seen mashin'. 
And goodness to gracious she's thin! 
She's about thirty-three, 
And this elegantee, 
Gets one thousand dollars a 
night; 
If "Jack Sheppard " she'd play, 
Twenty cents I 
would pay, 
And for Sarah I'd shout with delight. 
Oh, Sal, you're a 
daisey, 
My head you've turned crazy, 
how I 
wish I 
could parlez volts; 
I'd marry your sister, 
But each time I 
kissed her, 
I'd think of your red head and you; 
Your French eyes are bright, 
But, Sal, your form is light, 
Now be careful when you're out alone; 
Carry weights in each hand, 
Fill your shoes full of sand, 
Load your pockets with brick bats and stone.

The sad play of life is now past; 
Oce more is nearing the dark, unknown shore, 
The ni-uneuts are waning so fast! 
Far from the burden, the tumult and strife. 
While tears etimm'd e.-.tch sorrowing eye ; 
Sad was the whisper, the last words of life :

The sweet smile so kindly and true ; 
Dim are the eyes that once sparkled with glee,

The hopes that were bright as the dew. 
Dear is the vision that rnem'ry recalls, 
To hearts that forever must sigh ; 
Sad is the echo that lingering falls :

I 
love ta roam the bright green fields, 
I 
like to live at a 
farm, 
I 
love to stroll where the _ primroses grow, 
For a 
country life is a 
charm. 
I 
love to wander through the old farm-yard, 
Round by the old haystack, 
And listen to the chicks as they cackle, cackle, cackle, 
And the pretty little ducks, quack, quack. 
Ctionus. 
Quack, quack, goes the pretty little ducks, 
The hen's cackle is a 
warning, 
When the old rooster crows, everybody knows 
There's eggs for your breakfast in the morning. 
I 
love to gaze on the ripe yellow corn, 
I 
love to roll on the grass, 
I 
love to romp in the new mown hay 
Along with a 
pretty country lass. 
I 
love to wander by the old mill stream, 
And catch every breeze that blows, 
I 
love to see the lambs as the ramble in the fields, 
In the morning when the rocster crows. 
Quack, quack, etc. 
I 
love my home at the little white farm, 
Where the ivy entwines round the door, 
And I 
love to hear the lark as he soars on high, 
And I 
love to hear the old bull roar. 
I 
love to hear the milkmaid's song, 
And listen to the little busy bee; 
Well, you can have your cities and you can have your 
towns, 
But a 
country life for me. 
„AA, 
OH, FRED: TELL TilEI'd TO STOP. 
No doubt you have heard of the great fancy f-dr. 
That used to take place every day: 
Well. I 
thought for amusement I'd take my 
gir! there 
To pass a 
dull hour awalt% 
We went in you must know and :- aw Barnum' Ureat 
Show, 
Van 
mburgh's Menagerie as well; 
There were roundabouts, swings and all kind of 
things, 
Forget the day I 
never shall. 
SPoKEN.—Yes, when We got to the fair my girl 
wanted to have a 
ride on one of the swings. 
I said: 
All right, my darling," and we had a swing: but 
directly the swing went to and fro, she lustily called 
out: 
Cuorn -s. 
Oh, Fred! tell them to stop! 
That was the cry of Maria; 
But the more she said whoa! they said let it go, 
And the swing went a 
little bit higher. 
The people that stood romnl, of course they all laug.ltea 
But I 
only said stop the swiog; 
There were four or live others in the boats beside us, 
Saying. master, don't do such a.thing. 
'Twas then that some roughs caught hold of the ropes, 
Alaria fell down on her knee, 
And one of them said, the young man's turning red. 
But isn't he having a 
spree. 
Olt, Frt_d! etc. 
They soon stopped the swing and Maria got out. 
And quickly fell down on the floor; 
They brought. her some water, which soon brought 
her to, 
This girl whom I 
now do adore. 
Should you ever go there to the great fancy fair. 
Friends, take advice \while I 
sing. 
Of the great roundabout, it's the best fun that's out 
And finish the day with a 
swin...7. 
SPOKEN. — Mark now, before 
you get into the 
swing's boat, taake a 
bargain wit ii your young lady 
not to call out: 
Oh, Fred! etc. 
MARY ANN, I'LL TELL YOUR MA. 
Written and Composed by GEOFFREY Tuotts. 
Sung with great success by TONY PAsTott. 
The music of this song is published by E. H. Haaniso, 
Bowery, 
New York. 
Price 10 cents. 
I 
spoon a 
girl named Mary Ann, a 
tender little dove, 
Who costs me lots of half-pence, and a 
precious deal of love, 
She's living with her mother, as a maiden ought to do, 
And looks as straight and proper as a 
saint, or me or you. 
But somehow when I 
trot her round, no matter where we go, 
Pm struck with all the people that this maiden seems to know; 
For certain as Mary Ann I 
proudly take about, 
Some heads pop round the corner, and a 
vulgar voice will shout— 
CHORUS. 
Oh, very well, Mary Ann, I'll tell your ma, 
She little thought when you came out you'd go so far, 
I'm sure your mother doesn't know the girl you are, 
Mary Ann, fie: for shame, Yah yah yali! Ohl 3-alit 
We went last Whitsun Monday to the forest by the rail, 
We did the thing first class of course, at that I 
never fail; 
I 
tipp'd the guard a 
shilling, or what you might call a 
bob, 
To lock us in a 
carriage and preserve us from the mob. 
We sat on downy cushions and the curtains drew for fun, 
For Polly said her pretty eyes they could not bear the sun, 
But when we settled snugly and were just about to go 
A 
head came through the window and a 
fellow shouted— 
Oh, very well, etc. 
We wander'd through the forest glades as happy as could be. 
We thought front vulgar people there, we should at least be free, 
We sought a 
sweet secluded spot, where none our vows could hear, 
And whisper'd those soft, silly things, that lovers think so dear. 
We sat beneath a 
spreading oak, our loving arms entwined, 
While I 
was fond and foolish, she was gentle, sweet and kind; 
But just as I 
my passion told, and sealed it with a 
kiss, 
A 
chap birds-nesting up above, so rudely shouted this— 
Oh, very well, etc. 
We came away disguted, and we quickly made for home, 
For everywhe're we met the cry, no matter where we'd roam, 
My Mary Ann declared to me she knew those people not, 
In fact, she said she would not mix with such a 
vulgar lot. 
But on this precious mystery I 
have some little doubt, 
And almost think that Mary Ann must know-her way about, 
For when we parted at her door, or rather just inside, 
A voice came down the staircase, and her little brother cried— 
SPOKEN.—Oh: 011: oh! 
I'LL BET YOU TWO DOLLARS SHE DON'T,. 
CO'd right Secured, 1881. 
Original song, written and compo:-.ed by Wm. H. SI 
OWE. 
A 
girl will not marry a 
man she don't want, 
bet you two dollars she won't; 
A 
loafer she does not desire for a 
mate, 
1'11 bet you two dollars she don't; 
For her choice she will have, if the old man declares, 
That her judgment is stupid and blunt, 
And her mother insists she shall have one she don't 
want, 
I'll bet you two dollars she won't. 
Sometimes she'll declare, snap her eyes. Dull her hair, 
For her equal you'd long have to hunt; 
Coax her gently and easily, but don't try to drive her 
ni bet you two dollars she don't. 
A strong minded mother-in-law will never consent, 
I'll bet you two dollars she don't, 
To her son-in-law, spending an extra red cent, 
MI bet you two dollars she won't. 
All married men fools know the mother-in-law rules, 
And I'll tell it to young men that don't, 
'When married girls say, " I'll drive her away," 
I'll bet you two dollars you don't. 
To yourself you must say, how I 
long for the day, 
That my mother-in-law's spirit up will float, 
But when the time comes and you think she will go, 
I'll bet you two dollars she don't. 
(Continued.) 
Old man with young wife people call her a 
fool, 
I'll bet you two dollars he don't; 
Fglks think she has married the old man for his dust, 
I'll bet you two dollars he don't. 
Old men with great means feel like boys in their teens 
And with money they can have what they want, 
But without that great gem no girl would want them, 
I'll bet you two dollars they don't. 
Old maids, too, are sad, and some awfully mad, 
But they'll never teli, no, they wan't. 
When leap year has passed for a husband they've 
asked, 
He bets them two dollars he won't. 
No married man wants to dispute with his wife, 
1'11 bet you two dollars he don't; 
She's bound to be boss, still he thinks he can win, 
I'll bet you two dollars he won't. 
When the battle is o'er, and he's fiat on the floor, 
With the broom stick he gets a 
good thump, 
No more will he want of such warfare, not he, 
I'll bet you two dollars he don't. 
If they have but one child, and the husband wants 
more. 
And his wife she says " Ho, Sir, I 
won't," 
lie can try all he may, but I'll back all she'll say, 
And bet you, two dollars she don't,

The Sheenies will all meet together. 
In the synagogue to pass the time away, 
Saying prayers, no other cares,

FLYING SCUD. 
Written by LESTER & ALLEN. 
There was a 
young man 
Called the flying scud, 
His eyes they were false 
his name it was Mud. 
Cross-eyed in the teeth, 
And only one lung, 
When he'd open his mouth 
It would scare his tongue. 
CHORUS. 
So take my advice, go sit on the ice, 
And let it give rest to your brain; 
Remember if the manager ain't got no dust 
Seize on his wife's watch and chain. 
Je wore a 
doormat for a 
coat 
He never eat pie, 
He looked so entrancing 
With an umbrella for a 
necktie. -

To play flock of geese, 
And now he is wanted 
By the Jersey police.

The fisherman and his child are drowned!" 
Came ringing through the town; 
The father and child lay under the tide, 
And friends did mourn around.

For in yonder mist I 
see them still, 
Their milk- white sails I 
see." 
(Repeat last two lines.

'Twas the voice of their God that they heard, 
As they sank in the deep: 
Come to me, I

And thy precious soul I'll keep; 
Come to me, I

Thy precious soul I'll keep." 
rhe fisherman saw his boat was lost, 
He tried to save his child, 
He battlel the waves with all human power,. 
But the wind was howling wild; 
Then he spoke to his child, 
She answered not; he raised her tiny head, 
He cried in desnair: " Thy will be done:" 
The child he loved wa,! dead.

And when the storm ceased the sea went down, 
Brave men went cm the shore; 
The tide had gone out, they searched all about, 
From the sea two forms they bore. 
Their faces were calm, their hands were raised, 
As if in silent prayer,

A GRAND TIME AT CON EV ISLAND. 
By DENNIS F. 
Murtruy. 
l'm going to enjoy myself this summer, and hope 
you are too as well, 
I'm going to have a 
grand time if my winter clothes 
I 
have to sell, 
I'm going to Coney Island with me girl by the hand, 
And sit 
drink our lager with the music of the 
band. 
We'll ascend the elevator and have a 
view all round, 
And take in all that's to be seen from the ocean to 
the sound, 
We'll ate clam bakes and biled oyster stews and cut 
figures in the sand, 
And cut a 
dash just after hash as we step out so 
We'll hire a 
coach for tin cents each, no others in 
well take, 
And as we ride along the lanes our heads at friends 
we'll shake; 
A footman we'll have to hand us down at some big 
tine hotel, 
To cut it grand just understand, I 
mean to do it well. 
Peanuts I'll buy by the pint and peaches by the crate, 
And lemonade and nice champagne for me girl and I 
to ate. 
I'll buy McDonnell's eider and fresh milk from the 
cow, 
Just watch me if you see me there, you'll say to do it 
I 
know how. 
But the grandest time of all will be coming up the 
bay in a 
boat, 
After leaving Coney Island, just as full as a 
goat; 
Yes, I'll have a 
grand ould time if the divil was to 
pay, 
Or if for ever after I 
would have to chew salt hay. 
GIVE THE WORKING MAN A CHANCE. 
As originally sung by W ILL II. 
111onTos, at Howard Atheneum, 
Boston, Mass. 
Some boast of wealth and riches, but give me the 
hardy hand, 
Give me the honest workingman, the pride of every 
lane? 
Th man that earns his living by the sweat of labor's 
brew, 
That wields the axe, the pick, the spaue, or stands 
belling the plough. 
I 
love the sons of manly toil, they built up our success, 
And made a 
mighty nation of this western wilderness; 
Unto our bright protecting stars they nobly did 
advance, 
For well they knew our flag would give each working-
man a 
chance. 
They spanned the mighty prairie, they enriched the 
American soil, 
They built each railroad in the land, these sons of 
hardy toil: 
in vain did other climes compete, our vessels swept 
the sea, 
Fur labor was our bond of strength, bright labor, 
strong and free. 
I 
envy not the titled lord, nor yet the man of wealth, 
I'd rather have the sinews strong, that tinge of ruddy 
health, 
That labor gives to all her sons whose watchword is 
ad vance, 
What made our great success-- we gave our working. 
man a 
chance. 
53 
GIVE THE WORKING MAN A CHANCE. 
(Continued.) 
Let England send her hardy sons, to them we'll give 
the hand, 
We can't forget that Washington sprung from the 
motherbutd, 
Let Germany her thousands send, to leave their 
sunny Rhine, 
And Russia, from her icy plains, in countless thousands 
low, 
Let Ireland send each manly form, no tyrant here 
does stand, 
A welcome sweet we'll give to all in our bright 
Western land, 
Come from the home of Lafayette— the sunlit hills of 
France, 
For ' tis our greatest joy to give each workingman a 
chance. 
OFF FOR GEORGIA_ 
Way down in Georgia, upon the old plantation, 
There's where to live to be happy, light and free; 
And when our work was over, w€ had a 
new variation., 
And with the nigger wenches we had a 
jubilee. 
CHOP. us. 
Off for Georgia, so early in the morning; 
Off for Georgia before the break of day. 
Give our resp ,, cts to all the pretty 1%.-aller gals, 
For we're off for Georgia before the break of day. 
Way down in Georgia. upon the old plantation; 
Oh, how quick the day did pass, so lumpy, light and 
free, 
I 
wish that we were back again, and at our old voca-
tion ; 
Dancing on the green, by the double rule or three. 
Off for Georgia, etc.

HEART musINGs. 
Writ:ton by 7.Irz  T
. it. JOHNSON. 
Concealed within each human heart 
Are chambers vast and deep, 
Where eye of "stranger ne'er may rest— 
e'er may see what welcome guest 
Gladly there we keep. 
And memories too, of long ago 
Gather in each breast, 
Wiled lest the scornful world should know 
And smile because we love them so, 
sacred they and blest. 
For some who we've loved and trusted long 
Kindr,N1 to our souls, 
We lift the outer veil and they 
See something of our hearts that Jay

HEALTHY' DARLING. 
Composed and Sung by BOBBY Blum 
I 
got a 
healthy darling, and she weighs six hundr4 
pounds, 
She takes the cake in a 
big clam bake when she goes 
waltzing round ; 
I 
took her for an innocent darling, she's the devil in 
isgu ise, 
She locks me up in a 
Saratoga trunk with the cock-
roaches and dead flies. 
She caresses me with a 
broomstick, and combs my 
hair with a 
shoe, 
And leaves me home to mind the kid to skip the tra-
la-la-loo 
She's awful big and fat, so weak and yet so young, 
She talked until her teeth fell out and chewed up 
half her tongue. 
CHORUS. 
My Sally is a 
talker she's always chewing gum. 
Sleeping or waking she's always full of fun ; 
Rise and tally for my Sally, fill her with a 
chop, 
She will walk any man for a 
keg of beer away around 
the block. 
My married life was happy ' till after the honey moon, 
My wife she banged me in the jaw with a 
partly filled 
spittoon ; 
She is cross-eyed but she's pretty, got a foot like a 
Texas steer, 
She hits me with a 
billiard cue on my alabaster ear ; 
I 
haven't slept for a 
fortnight, my hair is turning 
grey, 
I 
take the Saint Vitas dance when the band begins to 
play ; 
I 
have to work on Sunday, she's atrocious cross and 
rude, 
I 
have to live on lunch,and sing " I 
Hope I 
Don't In-
trude." 
My Sally is a 
talker, etc.

HAVE BEEN TOO GOOD A FRIEND.. 
As sung by JOHNNY GIBBONS, with great sucess. 
I 
once could dress up in style, 
Had money at command; 
The ladies on me used to smile 
And take me by the hand. 
When anyone did money want. 
I 
had always some to lend; 
My clothes will show I 
acted rash, 
And been too good a 
friend. 
CHORUS. 
'Yes, they pass me by, 
None so poor as I, 
Yet never regretting, 
The past time forgetting, 
I'll take what fate may send. 
(Repeat Chorus.) 
The very men that I 
have lent 
Now pass me by with scorn; 
They never give me back a 
cent, 
Although I 
am forlorn. 
They used to laugh at all my jokes 
And humble to me bend; 
Not to myself, but other folks 
I've been too good a 
friend. 
Yes, they pass :
1,ks by, ete. 
I 
smile when thinking of the 
Amid my great mishaps; 
My clothes needs mending, and . o.v tile 
Would lil=e a 
little nap. 
To poverty I 
will not kneel, 
I'll take what fate may send; 
I 
smile to think, but then I 
feel 
I've been too good a 
friend. 
Yes, they pas.; me by, etc.

Oh, she loves me, and I

So happy we could be,

Oh, I 
have a 
son—his name it is Frank— 
He broke open a 
bank, 
Swallowed an oil tank. 
Like the whole family he is very rank, 
lie wears diamond rings in his ears, 
He has eight poor young girls now on a 
string, 
They all got a 
wedding-ring, 
To the altar them he won't bring; 
If Ile don't look out, Heavens, he'll go to Sing Sing, 
And marry the keeper for life.

Then if I 
catch Frankie I'll break his nose 
So he won't fit his clothes; 
I'll throw him in the fire where he'll never get froze, 
And then dance a 
reel on his lungs. 
He went down to the theatre looking like a 
saint, 
On his face he had paint, 
The man says, " You're Jack Sheppard," he Myst 
" 
You're a 
liar, it ain't," 
And he tires seven shots at Bud Granger. 
He went out for a 
drink in a 
Dutch beer saloon, 
Eat a 
cheese and a 
moon, 
Then stabbed the barkeeper and killed a 
big coon, 
And drank all the whiskey in the place.
