Tiimiaq, something carried, 
 
—for Joan Naviyuk Kane 
 
in a book 
    we read about these things  
    in a book  
                   carved figures 
aŋun, aġnaq, migiqłiq 
 
each word I know 
as a dictionary 
entry 
take this away 
and give paper  
in return 
 
my tongue against the ink 
is English 
naluaġmiut 
sucking in the flimsy fibers 
spewing out a stumbling word 
I teach them to Sinaġuk and Paniataaq 
all wrong 
they round the words in their small mouths 
small rivers, small stones 
don’t pity me, they are heavy stones  
but they are the small rivers 
I drop the stones into 
 
Classrooms stand between us, Aakaŋ 
but their language classes taught me 
how to learn from books. 
 
The years I spent away at college 
bring me back, Aakaŋ. 
This is how to learn a foreign tongue 
from books. 
 
still, from a leather pouch small figures 
tumble out—aŋun—perhaps aaŋauraq or iŋmi—his hood around his shoulders  
aġnak—perhaps nuliaq—how tenderly her brown atigi is distinguished  
 
atausiq qituġnaklu atausiq paniklu 
one and one 
tiimiaq in a small pouch, in a pocket or aġġinaq,  
like portraits on my phone 
in case of long separation 
the ice floe shakes loose and tumbles him south 
 
 
 
 
a village, elsewhere, all winter 
they are remembered 
just so, tenderly, the small figures, 
placeholders, bringing to mind his beloved. 
even now the residual tenderness 
travels across the sterile page 
the image of the images 
of the beloved 
love refracted through the making cannot be contained 
in the dry clinical photo, even now, 
the beloved tug patiently across the distant page 
at the thread strung between their hearts 
even the collection 
the price of the sale  
of the figures 
their storage in a catalogued archive (or disposal) 
cannot undo the stringing of that tenderness and memory 
it strums a note familiar, but unique, 
one reaching toward four 
the hands that carved them to remember 
and distance that memory traveled 
and tugged at his heart, remain. 
 
just so, I carry this memory with me, 
of Ugiuvak, of four women and a man climbing 
a steep ice cliff 
 
and a small gathering of poets  
each of us making, just so, our small figures 
to be carried  
what we are making cannot be undone
