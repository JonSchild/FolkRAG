So that's where you moved.  
 
EN  12:08   
We had to go there for visa reasons. It was the only domicile that I had. So we had to go there. But then, I was in 
school, and so we were using money, but not making much so, um, so yeah they were very kind to allow us to 
stay. 
 
HN  12:25   
and start. 
 
MM  12:26   
Sure. So how did, how did you end up in Japan? Why were you there when you met, if I may ask? 
 
EN  12:32   
And you want the truth right? 
 
MM  12:34   
Well, if I may ask... 
 
EN  12:36   
I'm kidding. But, I studied chemistry in school, and... thank you. And on camera, too! We're real people. There's 
more? Thank you. That's love. 
 
EN  12:52   
Yeah, I studied chemistry in college, but I didn't do very well at it. And so I thought, I can't get a job in this, I 
don't have any confidence in chemistry. So when my Japanese teacher said, Oh, you should go teach, you know, 
do JET Program in Japan. I said, All right. We'll do that. So I taught for three years. And then, he wasn't ready to 
go back, well, come to the states yet. So, I changed jobs and worked in Tokyo for four. So, we were, I was there 
seven years. 
 
HN  13:21   
Yeah.  
 
MM  13:22   
Okay.

Almost, yeah.  
 
MM  14:49   
That's a lot. 
 
EN  14:50   
Well his prices were low, too. I mean, our prices were low, because he didn't have the confidence to put them up. 
And we were still getting our mailing list, getting our fans. Little by little. 
 
HN  15:01   
Yeah.  
 
MM  15:01   
So was that all local or within a certain region?  
 
HN  15:05   
Started was local  
 
EN  15:06

You have to start somewhere. 
 
EN  16:10   
You do, you do. Thankfully we've, he's... 
 
MM  16:20   
So how are you firing? Is it electric or gas?

know, firing this glaze actually too. Is oxidation firing.  
 
MM  16:53

You know, this is teapot. Yeah. Make, you know. 
 
MM  20:17   
So you got a lot of feedback. 
 
HN  20:20   
Yeah, I changed. Size, and color, and, what can I say. Yeah, mainly size, color. 
 
MM  20:28   
Do you, do you think the forms that you make now are still influenced by what you learned in Japan?  
 
HN  20:35   
Yeah. Yeah. You know, I care the shape and the shade.  
 
MM  20:42   
Yeah, yeah. Absolutely.  
 
HN  20:43   
And texture actually. Yeah. Yeah. 
 
MM  20:48   
That's really fun. So, art fairs obviously, are a lot of work. You still do a lot of art fair. Or have you shifted?  
 
HN  20:58   
Yeah, still, still. And this year is, I think changed, you know. Has to change. After fourty, my energy is down. I 
feel tired, you know, so. And luckily, we got a good tour this, this spring, you know, at Cambridge. Somewhat 
chance, different chance, you know? Yeah. So... what's that? 
 
EN  21:31   
I was just gonna say, this is, these are all old and they're all seconds or thirds. But this is a very Japanese glaze. So 
that's definitely influenced by Japan. And then this shape, the turnip is a very popular shape for weddings in 
Japan. And so that's another thing he brings here. People don't usually make the spouts on bowls. So that's very 
influenced by Japan. And then just simple, but textural is very, very Japanese, I would say. 
 
HN  22:04   
...生活の中に 
 
EN  22:04   
たのしま? ふつうにあるて 
 
HN  22:06   
ある 
 
EN  22:07   
ふつうにある. なり, 綺麗な物? 
 
HN  22:08   
Yeah. 
 
EN  22:08   
Ok, so, he wants, 
 
HN  22:12   
...素朴な物... 
 
EN  22:14   
he wants people to enjoy... 
 
HN  22:16   
...I want, my favorite... 
 
EN  22:22   
Yeah, he wants people to enjoy every, everyday things. So when you drink your tea, you enjoy your tea better 
because of the feel. And because of the color that you see. 
 
HN  22:32   
People choose, ah, what's that? 
 
EN  22:34   
They can find a place that feels good in their hands. 
 
HN  22:37   
If you want to relax, I want to choose this one. That's I want, you know. 
 
EN  22:42   
This cup. 
 
MM  22:42   
Okay.  
 
HN  22:42   
Yeah, I tried to glaze, smooth glaze or simple shape. 
 
EN  22:48   
Or with tea you use a white cup so that you can see the green color and it relaxes you.  
 
HN  22:53   
Yeah. I don't want my piece is directly you, just... いい ある かい かんじ... ストレイトに くる かんじやない
やつ... 
 
EN  23:05   
Ok. So he wants it, he wants the energy of the cup to be somewhat blurred. So that you have a little bit of 
imaginative... 
 
HN  23:14   
like a feel, you know 
 
EN  23:15   
...like you are interacting with it. You have to imagine a little bit too. 
 
HN  23:19   
...like a relax time... 
 
EN  23:21   
It's really hard to... 
 
HN  23:24   
...oh, that's nice... 
 
MM  23:24   
That's ok, yeah. 
 
HN  23:25   
that's I want, my t... you know, my, my vision and target. That I want make. 
 
MM  23:32   
That makes sense.  
 
HN  23:34   
Yeah. 
 
MM  23:35   
Yeah. Okay. That's nice. So, do you find that the people who buy your work are familiar with Japanese ceramic 
sometimes or not very often?  
 
HN  23:52   
なん だろね 
 
EN  23:56   
全然 
 
HN  23:57   
ね. 
 
EN  23:57   
I don't think so at all.  
 
HN  23:59   
ね. 
 
EN  23:59   
In general. I mean, there are definitely people who are familiar, but in general, they're not. But they get the 
simplicity. And the say, "Oh, my life is so chaotic. This makes me feel calm and good." 
 
HN  24:11   
Yeah, calm. That word. 
 
EN  24:13   
Yeah, calm and peaceful.  
 
MM  24:14   
Okay.  
 
HN  24:15   
Yeah, that's the word. 
 
MM  24:18   
It takes a little... that's good. Okay. So, so people understand what you're trying to do.  
 
MM  24:25   
They might not know where it comes... 
 
HN  24:25   
Yeah. 
 
EN  24:27   
They feel the energy. They can see the aura, they can feel the energy.  
 
HN  24:29   
Yeah.  
 
EN  24:30   
It's funny. 
 
MM  24:32   
Interesting.  
 
HN  24:33   
Yeah. 
 
MM  24:33   
Ok. So you're still, you're still working full time and selling it art fairs. 
 
HN  24:42   
Yeah. 
 
MM  24:42   
Do you do gallery sales at all now, or?  
 
HN  24:45   
Just, just a few, just a few place. You know, I'm not good, what can I say, this much, this, what's that?  
 
EN  24:58   
You mean to... 
 
HN  24:59   
ひげ 
 
EN  25:01   
but are you trying to say, to give some to the gallery and some to the art fairs... 
 
HN  25:05   
This much amount... Yeah. 
 
EN  25:06   
Yeah, he's not good at separating that. 
 
HN  25:07   
Not good. I want to...  
 
EN  25:10   
He only... 
 
HN  25:11   
I want to see the people's face. 
 
MM  25:14   
Okay. Yeah.  
 
HN  25:15   
That's very important. 
 
EN  25:16   
And talk to them.  
 
HN  25:16   
Yeah. 
 
MM  25:17   
Yeah. That's a big part of it. 
 
HN  25:19   
Yeah, that's my fun, you know. My English is... Study, you know. 
 
MM  25:26   
Yeah. Yeah.  
 
HN  25:27   
...very well, you know. 
 
MM  25:29   
Well, and to make that connection. And  
 
HN  25:31   
Yeah. 
 
MM  25:31   
learn how they feel about your work, maybe?  
 
HN  25:34   
Yeah. Yeah. That's I feel, you know. 
 
MM  25:36   
Yeah, I think a lot of potters, well. I talk to people who are on both sides of it. Some people don't do any of their 
own sales. And I have to really ask, how does that work for you? It's different.  
 
HN  25:50   
Yeah.  
 
MM  25:51   
Okay. I'm going to... 
 
 
Video File #2 (afc2018030_05162_mv02.mp4) 
 
MM  0:02   
So, Elizabeth was just talking about some of the customer requests that you've gotten.  
 
HN  0:08   
Ok. 
 
MM  0:08   
And I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about, how is that challenging? Or what kinds of things have 
you been asked to make that you don't know about? Because they're American types of things. 
 
EN  0:22   
Do you understand, custom work?  
 
HN  0:24   
No. 
 
EN  0:25   
だから, 人はあなた の 作らない物, 作ってを しいて言う たら, あなた は まえ に ”yes” と うた いま  も
う やらないて 
 
HN  0:35   
Yeah, it's... 
 
EN  0:35   
So, what is difficult? 
 
HN  0:39   
I can't get imagination, you know, image from customer. Just extra, you know, this choice, this choice, I have to 
think about this choice, this choice, is too much for me. You know? but, uh 
 
EN  0:57   
It's not his imagination, it's their imagination.  
 
HN  1:00   
Yeah.  
 
EN  1:00   
And he worries that they are not going to like what he comes up with.  
 
HN  1:05   
Yeah. 
 
EN  1:06   
Right? 
 
HN  1:06   
Yeah. I think most potter don't like, you know. 
 
MM  1:10   
Yeah. 
 
HN  1:11   
but and, extra we have to make. 
 
MM  1:15   
Oh, yes. So you end up using a lot of materials, too. 
 
EN  1:20   
And trying to get rid of extra product, that isn't yours.  
 
MM  1:24   
Okay. I see, I see. Okay. So what kinds of, what kinds of things do you like to make the best? Like, what are your 
favorite? 
 
HN  1:36   
Um, for... I'm now making teapots. Especially downstairs, now. Here.  
 
MM  1:44   
Yeah.  
 
HN  1:45   
Because after show, you know, I feel my sensitivity is down. So I want to test my sensitivity, you know, sense, 
you know, skill. So I'm making teapot first, after I make big one, and bud vase, cups, you know. Yeah. In the 
winter, we can't firing, you know, so my image is down. What can I make? This shape, this glaze, you know. 
 
MM  2:22   
Oh, ok. 
 
HN  2:22   
Yeah. I have a sketchbook, you know, so I do that.  
 
MM  2:31   
Difficult. 
 
HN  2:32   
Yeah. So, but you know... I want to know the, now what can I, what, I have technique, skill, you know, so good 
challenge, you know, making tea pot, you know, lid, spout, body, you know, handle, strainer, is, need a technique. 
Yeah, so this is the hardest work, you know. 
 
MM  3:02   
Okay.  
 
HN  3:03   
Yeah. So I want to make hard one first, you know. 
 
MM  3:07   
Yeah. So do you. Do you often do something difficult or challenging in the winter?  
 
HN  3:13   
Yeah. Yeah. 
 
MM  3:15   
Okay. 
 
EN  3:16   
But every year, he starts with something different. It's hilarious. He'll say, "maybe it's better if I just make a ton of 
bud vases now." And he'll do that for months.  
 
HN  3:24   
Because bud vase is big sales, so. 
 
EN  3:28   
He's trying to figure out what works best. 
 
HN  3:30   
And fun, actually, you know, making the bud vase.  
 
EN  3:39   
And bud vases are, like a little, they're like a little test for bigger things. If he likes the shape or people like the 
shape he can make them bigger.  
 
MM  3:48   
Okay.  
 
HN  3:48   
This size vase. This is a second... Like simple Japanese, Asian technique, you know. The brushwork. I like this 
simplistic, you know, 
 
MM  4:02   
That's beautiful. 
 
HN  4:04   
Not flat. I changed a little, you know, degree, and I touched a little.  
 
MM  4:11   
Yeah.  
 
HN  4:12   
And I like this glaze. Very smooth glaze. You know, that's my, my uh, target. You know?  
 
MM  4:21   
Okay, yeah.  
 
HN  4:22   
Simple and clean, and good shape, good shade, you know. People touch, feel good, you know. 
 
MM  4:30   
Yeah. So then would you maybe make larger vases after this?  
 
HN  4:36   
Yeah, yeah. I lost this glaze, I am testing now.  
 
MM  4:39   
Oh, okay. 
 
HN  4:42   
Yeah, material changed, you know?  
 
MM  4:45   
Oh, that's difficult.  
 
HN  4:46   
Yeah. Yeah. 
 
MM  4:48   
Yeah. Okay. So when you, when you are able to work more in the summer and when it's, when it's warm. What 
kind of a schedule to you have? 
 
HN  5:02   
Schedule... 
 
MM  5:02   
Or do you have a schedule? 
 
HN  5:05   
Art fair is main. Between art fair, I tried two, two or, at least two firing.  
 
EN  5:15   
It's insane. Insane schedule. 
 
HN  5:18   
Yeah.  
 
MM  5:18   
Okay. 
 
HN  5:20   
Between, I try to make new things. 
 
EN  5:24   
So if they're one week apart, he will come home on Sunday night, and the next morning he'll try to fire. And that'll 
take a whole 24 hours. He'll open the kiln, you know 12, 15 hours later. 
 
HN  5:34   
before I go to the art fair... 
 
EN  5:36   
He'll fire again. And the morning we're leaving, we're supposed to leave at 10 am? He opens it at nine. Like, oh 
no, oh no, pack pack pack pack pack. Guess we'll price later! Yeah.  
 
HN  5:47   
Yeah.  
 
EN  5:48   
Every week.  
 
MM  5:49   
It's hard to make enough work. If you can't work in winter, I would guess that's a challenge, yeah. 
 
HN  5:55   
Yeah. 
 
EN  5:56   
Well, and we never know what's gonna sell at the show. So if we run out mugs, then uh oh, you gotta hurry up 
and make mugs.  
 
MM  6:03   
Make a lot more, yeah.  
 
EN  6:04   
But you never know if that's gonna sell. So.  
 
MM  6:06   
Yeah. Are there certain things that you feel like are usually more popular? Or does it, does it just vary with every 
single show? 
 
EN  6:18   
Well, definitely mugs and bud vases are probably number one.  
 
HN  6:21   
Different.  
 
EN  6:23   
But it depends. 
 
HN  6:23   
If we sell mug, sell out. And I try make, but next show is none. 
 
EN  6:30   
We sell none. 
 
MM  6:32   
Okay,  
 
HN  6:33   
Yeah, basically... 
 
EN  6:34   
I keep stats for each of the shows that we go to. So we know how many mugs sold, and so maybe this is a mug 
show, but then we have to do three times or so to say okay, it still is a mug show. So we know that one of the 
shows in May is always a bud vase show. Oh, my goodness. It's just bud vase, bud vase, bud vase.  
 
HN  6:51   
Yeah. But, uh 
 
MM  6:52   
Okay.  
 
EN  6:53   
So you kind of get to know.  
 
HN  6:54   
Yeah. But people come our booth for our, you know, people come our booth. People want variety. That's, I think, 
you know, so that's why I try to make, you know, as much as I can, you know. Yeah. 
 
MM  7:10   
Yeah. So do you have like a set list of shows that you do every year now? Or do they...  
 
HN  7:20   
Yeah. 
 
EN  7:21   
Kind of, yeah, pretty much. Pretty much. Yeah, we've whittled them down. And of course, it's changed over the 
years where we try, we wouldn't get into the better shows. And 
 
HN  7:32   
Yeah. 
 
EN  7:33   
we know pretty much. We're still trying to get to the next level of shows. 
 
MM  7:37   
Yeah, that's a challenge, that's difficult.  
 
EN  7:40   
Little by little. Yeah. 
 
HN  7:41   
We are, good show, between medium shows  
 
EN  7:47   
Between medium and excellent, right. And sometimes we get into the excellent ones. 
 
HN  7:52   
Yeah. 
 
MM  7:53   
It takes a while to build that business, I think. 
 
HN  7:56   
Yeah. 
 
MM  7:57   
To learn what fairs want sometimes. 
 
EN  8:00   
Right, and what jurors want. 
 
MM  8:02   
Yes. 
 
HN  8:04   
But luckily, we got the good, nice customer, nice people. 
 
EN  8:08   
Yeah, they follow you. 
 
HN  8:09   
Came back, you know.  
 
EN  8:10   
The mailing list has been huge. 
 
HN  8:12   
Our appreciation, yeah.  
 
MM  8:13   
That's great. So do, you have people that you see year after year? 
 
HN  8:18   
Yeah, we talk, yeah.  
 
EN  8:18   
Oh yeah. 
 
MM  8:20   
That's nice, that's really nice. How do you, how do you decide about the pricing of your work? Or how have you 
developed that? 
 
HN  8:31   
We fight. 
 
MM  8:34   
Okay. 
 
HN  8:35   
I'm lower, she is higher. 
 
EN  8:38   
We started out where his bud vases were eight to ten dollars. This was $10. He could sell, at one of our art fairs, 
three day art fairs. He sold 200 of them in one weekend.  
 
MM  8:52   
Wow. 
 
EN  8:53   
That was great. But he was so exhausted and had nothing for the next fair. And so you know, I raised them to 14, 
and then a little to 16. And then he started making such a variety. He realized that every year he needed a new, 
something new. And so he'd make maybe four new designs each year. And so I'd put those up a little bit. And so 
little by little, we would climb up. And every single year we, we raise the prices. Generally he always made new 
stuff and the old ones kind of faded away. And so people couldn't say, "Well, that was $10 before." Right?  
 
MM  9:29   
Ah, okay. 
 
EN  9:29   
Because he's not a production guy who makes the same thing every single year, every single year. He's always 
evolving. 
 
HN  9:36   
Yeah. 
 
EN  9:36   
And so those things do go away, and we can reprice as we go. Yeah. So that's kind of how it is. And I look at 
other people's work. 
 
MM  9:44   
I was wondering if that was maybe a guide. 
 
EN  9:47   
Right. 
 
MM  9:47   
If there are people who make similar... 
 
EN  9:49   
But then he pulls me back, so I might not go as far as I would, but then slowly, you know, you do it for a year, and 
then he's comfortable with it, and then raise it another dollar or two, so very slow.  
 
HN  9:59   
Yeah, I change size and  
 
EN  10:00   
But he also wanted to get a mailing list. So in the beginning, he wanted it low, get them kind of caught on his pots 
 
HN  10:01   
yeah  
 
EN  10:03   
get them coming back. And we realized, we watched people, they would buy a bud vase the first year, and then 
maybe a cup the next year or two cups 
 
HN  10:18   
Yeah. 
 
EN  10:18   
and then they'd buy a tea pot.  
 
HN  10:19   
tea pot, yeah.  
 
EN  10:20   
And so we were watching the trend. And if they really liked his work, they would, they would pay a bigger price. 
They would even tell us that we needed to charge more.  
 
MM  10:28   
Oh. That's kind.  
 
EN  10:31   
Well, so it has been kind of an adventure. 
 
HN  10:32   
Yeah, yeah. 
 
MM  10:34   
Yeah, it's a lot to navigate. 
 
HN  10:38   
...don't want to see... 
 
EN  10:39   
You would be half price. 
 
MM  10:40   
Aw. 
 
EN  10:42   
He's always saying that "I'm here, I want to be here. So I have a long way to go." And "I don't have the confidence 
of this pricing, I have the conference of this pricing." And so that's why I have to say, "No, no, no, look around 
you. You're here. Let's do this pricing." And he says no, and I do it anyway. We're a very good team. 
 
HN  11:01   
And I feel... 
 
EN  11:04   
We need to survive. 
 
HN  11:04   
Yeah, I feel my, what's that, skill is to here, so I don't want to, you know, people pay a lot. 
 
MM  11:13   
Yeah, yeah.  
 
HN  11:14   
You know, yeah, so. 
 
MM  11:15   
Okay. 
 
HN  11:17   
Yeah, I want more skill and... 
 
MM  11:29   
How do you, how do you balance the workload between the two of you? Do you do mostly the pottery or do you 
do some of the business, the paperwork?  
 
HN  11:40   
She does paperwork, all. I do the, yeah, making. 
 
MM  11:45   
Do you both do sales at the show? 
 
HN  11:47   
Yeah. Yeah, and the kids, too. 
 
MM  11:50   
Well, yes. So they travel with you.  
 
HN  11:53   
Yeah, yeah. 
 
MM  11:54   
That's great.  
 
HN  11:55   
Yeah.  
 
EN  11:56   
Most of the time. 
 
HN  11:57   
Yeah, most of the time, yeah. They like it. They can know, they will know, you know. The sales, you know. 
 
MM  12:06   
They'll be good salespeople. 
 
HN  12:08   
Yeah. Hey. You have a good smile. 
 
HN  12:12   
Yeah, and our customer miss, I mean you know, they didn't there, you know. They're not there. You know, our 
customer miss, "Oh Yuri, where's Yuri, and Emi?" 
 
MM  12:26   
That's sweet. 
 
HN  12:26   
Yeah.  
 
MM  12:27   
They're part of it. 
 
HN  12:28   
Yeah.  
 
MM  12:29   
Do they like to make, do they like to make things? I'm guessing, from the artwork. But do they ever make things 
in clay? 
 
HN  12:36   
She's just starting, you know, Yuri just start.  
 
EN  12:39   
She never wanted to, she didn't want to get her hands dirty.  
 
MM  12:43   
Oh! 
 
EN  12:45   
Oh boy, you're a potter's daughter, girl. 
 
HN  12:48   
She does do the drawing, maybe future, she, I made glaze and she you know, draw.  
 
MM  12:54   
Yeah. That'd be nice. 
 
HN  12:58   
Maybe good, good sales, better than me. Yeah. People likes, you know, kids. Both. 
 
MM  13:07   
Yeah, they do. 
 
HN  13:08   
Yeah.  
 
MM  13:08   
Yeah, that's nice. Well, it's nice that you have that ongoing relationship with people.  
 
HN  13:14   
Yeah. Yeah.  
 
MM  13:15   
They get to know you.  
 
EN  13:16   
It's an energy. For sales you have to have, you have to give them a story. We were just talking to another potter 
from Cambridge, who was saying, "I used to think I could let my pottery sell itself." And we said, "Uh uh, you 
have to sell it." Gently. And that approach has helped us so much. So much, because he, he's not way outgoing. 
But he will say to people, "Let me know if you have questions," just to break the ice and make sure that they 
understand that he's approachable. Or he'll talk about his glaze a little bit and be done, and see what they say. He's 
a good listener. 
 
HN  13:53   
Yeah.  
 
EN  13:54   
And a good teacher of your culture, which really helps the story. 
 
MM  14:00   
So is it mostly, is it mostly speaking with people? Do you have, do you have signs or brochures or... 
 
HN  14:08   
A brochure? Yeah. And what I when I make you know, we talk and the people's history, you know. Yeah, they 
come sometime, you know, they went to Japan and how was everything. I like this one, I like this one, you know. 
Did you try that one? Small conversation, start, you know. 
 
MM  14:33   
Yeah. 
 
HN  14:33   
It's fun, you know. Yeah.  
 
MM  14:34   
That's good, it's great.  
 
HN  14:36   
And people like Japan, you know. 
 
MM  14:38   
Do you get, do you get questions about Japanese culture, and things... 
 
HN  14:42   
Yeah, yeah, yeah. What, next time, where do you want to go? You know? 
 
MM  14:47   
Oh, ok, yeah. 
 
HN  14:49   
I recommend this is good. You know, this food is tasty. This culture is nice. Yeah. 
 
MM  14:56   
That's great. Do you have, do you have friends in this area who are also from Japan? Have you been able to... 
 
HN  15:06   
Ah, Japanese are some, in this town, you know. Yeah. Ah, Japan interested? Few, you know, yeah, we have a 
Japanese garden.  
 
MM  15:22   
Oh nice. Okay, yeah. 
 
HN  15:23   
Yeah, we talk sometime, you know? What's that, gardening guy? Helper, you know?  
 
MM  15:31   
That's nice. 
 
HN  15:31   
Yeah. Yeah. 
 
MM  15:33   
Do you get to go back to Japan very often to visit? 
 
HN  15:37   
We tried, every two years, you know, but not this year, you know, this spring. Very busy. So I'd like stay here 
making. Yeah. 
 
MM  15:50   
It's a big trip. 
 
HN  15:51   
Big trip. Yeah. 
 
MM  15:52   
With kids, too, I think. 
 
HN  15:54   
Yeah, yeah. And the ticket is expensive, you know.  
 
MM  15:58   
Yes. 
 
HN  15:59   
Yeah. Yeah. I'd like to go and spend, you know, one month, two months, be apprentice, other, different area's 
potter. Making different, you know, tasting... This is different taste. I start, started stamp and slip work first. Yeah. 
So I'd like to know more, different technique. Yeah. 
 
MM  16:30   
Do you have, are there specific people who you want to go and learn from, or? 
 
HN  16:34   
Two, two people, two studio I'd like to contact.

MM  16:58   
Do you, do you follow them online? or?  
 
HN  17:01   
Yeah.  
 
MM  17:03   
It's a good resource.  
 
HN  17:04   
Yeah, yeah. Some influence, you know, yeah. 
 
MM  17:06   
Yeah. Yeah, that's great. 
 
HN  17:09   
One guy use the mold plus wheel throwing, it's more different shape. So, I can't do that. But imagination. Yeah. 
 
MM  17:19   
Yeah. So everything, everything you make is thrown on the wheel. Is that? 
 
HN  17:23   
Yeah. Yeah. Basically. Yeah. Just a couple few, the plate. Long plate, you know. 
 
MM  17:30   
Do you roll those out with a slab roller? 
 
HN  17:33   
This, this one is, the stone I use. Stone texture.  
 
HN  17:33   
Yeah, slab roller. Yeah, yeah. And I use the, what's that, stone. You know? 
 
MM  17:52   
I see, oh wow. So it's got... 
 
HN  17:56   
Especially I use this glaze summertime. Because it looks, feel cool, you know. 
 
MM  18:05   
May I?  
 
HN  18:05   
Yeah. 
 
MM  18:07   
It's beautiful. 
 
HN  18:07   
It's cracking. That's why we use.  
 
MM  18:09   
Oh. You keep all of those for yourself.  
 
HN  18:12   
Yeah. 
 
MM  18:12   
Oh, it's beautiful.  
 
HN  18:13   
Yeah. Small, just one technique but, you know, I'd like to people feel and touch. 
 
MM  18:21   
Do you, do you press this into a mold?  
 
HN  18:25   
Ah, no.  
 
MM  18:25   
Or you just, you just bring it up with your hand? 
 
HN  18:27   
I use, you know, use the, what's that, slab roller, and the cut. And you know, edges up. 
 
MM  18:36   
With your hand?  
 
HN  18:36   
Yeah. 
 
EN  18:37   
Roll of clay. You roll clay underneath, right.  
 
EN  18:39   
Yeah. 
 
HN  18:39   
And dry very slow.  
 
MM  18:40   
Oh, ok. Yeah. That's nice. 
 
HN  18:42   
Yeah. Very simple technique. Yeah. I don't need many glazes together, just one glaze.  
 
MM  18:55   
Yeah.  
 
HN  18:56   
At least, maybe two glazes. 
 
MM  19:00   
You brush a little bit.  
 
HN  19:02   
Yeah. Brush. Yeah.  
 
MM  19:03   
But not much. Ok. 
 
HN  19:05   
Yeah. Point, you know. What can I say. I'd like, ポイント を きたい.  
 
EN  19:13   
どう に ポイント を きたい. 
 
HN  19:17   
Face. 
 
EN  19:19   
You want a front? 
 
HN  19:20   
Front, means this is not straight, which is front, you know. 
 
MM  19:27   
Ok, I see. So it's not quite  
 
HN  19:29   
Yeah. There is point. 
 
MM  19:31   
It's not flat, or there's a... Okay. 
 
HN  19:33   
And people think... "Oh." You know. I want. 
 
EN  19:39   
So it's perfectly imperfect.  
 
EN  19:41   
Imperfect. 
 
EN  19:42   
In fact, he'll add, add a step to his pieces where he could just put the neck on it and be done, and it would be nice 
and perfect. But he'd rather add clay later and make it a little imperfect. Because it means someone made it and 
something to look at. 
 
HN  19:59   
Yeah. Yeah. 
 
MM  20:00   
Yeah.  
 
EN  20:00   
Imagination. 
 
MM  20:01   
It's a little bit of interest.  
 
HN  20:03   
Yeah. 
 
MM  20:03   
To have something to look for, or to see?  
 
HN  20:08   
Yeah, yeah. Sorry, they... 
 
MM  20:17   
Oh, that's okay. So you're a member of the clay workers guild?  
 
HN  20:22   
Yeah, okay.  
 
MM  20:23   
When did you become a member? 
 
HN  20:26   
2009?  
 
EN  20:28   
Probably. 
 
HN  20:28   
I think, yeah. 
 
MM  20:30   
How did you, how did you learn about that? 
 
HN  20:34   
How did you learn? 
 
EN  20:35   
Was that Sean? 
 
MM  20:36   
Did you meet someone, or? 
 
EN  20:37   
It was probably Sean, wasn't it? ... No, someone told us. I think it was Sean. 
 
HN  20:44   
Oh, okay, yeah.  
 
EN  20:45   
A potter in town.  
 
HN  20:46   
Yeah, maybe, yeah, in town. 
 
EN  20:47   
He's not a part of it, but. Not a member. 
 
MM  20:51   
Okay, yeah. Do you know, do you know lots of potters in the area now? Or? 
 
HN  20:57   
Some amateurs you know, some professionals. Yes. Yeah. 
 
MM  21:02   
That's, is that helpful?  
 
HN  21:05   
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Next, next winter, we'd like to start the Christmas sale together.  
 
MM  21:18   
Yeah, that's exciting. 
 
HN  21:20   
Maybe tour this area. 
 
MM  21:21   
Oh, is that with the people from the guild? Or is that just like Rockford area? 
 
HN  21:31   
Mainly guild people are Woodstock area. 
 
MM  21:34   
Oh, ok. 
 
HN  21:34   
It's, uh, 45 minutes far, you know, or a little more. So if I do the tour, Rockford, it's a little far. 
 
MM  21:45   
Yeah, it's a long drive.  
 
HN  21:47   
So only Rockford area. Yeah. 
 
MM  21:52   
What kinds of things do you do with the guild? Do you go to, go to meetings or? 
 
HN  21:57   
We are not good, so.  
 
MM  22:00   
Oh 
 
HN  22:00   
Just a Christmas sale. And sometimes, what's that, demonstration? I want to go. 
 
MM  22:06   
Oh, ok. They have people come and teach... 
 
HN  22:10   
Study  
 
EN  22:11   
Workshops.  
 
HN  22:11   
Workshop, yeah.  
 
MM  22:12   
Okay. Yeah. That's a that's a good resource to have, I think. 
 
HN  22:17   
Yeah.  
 
EN  22:17   
Except they like very decorated pots. And so they always invite people who do decorated stuff, which is great, but 
it's not his style. So he doesn't.  
 
HN  22:28   
Yeah. 
 
MM  22:29   
Interesting. Yeah, I met Bob and Susan.  
 
HN  22:36   
Oh okay.  
 
MM  22:37   
And so they were talking about establishing the guild 
 
HN  22:40   
Oh, yeah. 
 
MM  22:41   
The sort of things... So yeah, okay. It sounds like there are a lot of people who do different things there. 
 
HN  22:47   
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I went to the, that Christmas sale. 
 
MM  22:57   
I learned about it, but I am traveling so much right now it's really difficult, so  
 
HN  23:02   
Ah, I see. 
 
MM  23:03   
maybe someday.  
 
HN  23:04   
Yeah.  
 
MM  23:06   
Yeah. Okay. So but you're thinking about doing a tour here in Rockford?  
 
HN  23:10   
Yeah.  
 
MM  23:11   
What, do you know what time of year maybe? Or?  
 
HN  23:13   
I am not sure, we will know the Minnesota tour. Do you have pamphlet? 
 
MM  23:17   
Minnesota, St. Croix. 
 
HN  23:22   
St. Croix. Yeah. So this year, we are in.  
 
MM  23:27   
Wonderful.  
 
HN  23:28   
Yeah. So, you know, we'd like to know, you know, very successful, you know? 
 
MM  23:34   
Yeah, I hear that it's a very good, very good tour for people.  
 
HN  23:39   
So, you know, I'd like to know detail. We already talked. 
 
EN  23:45   
How much pottery you'll have left. The thing is, we have an open house at his studio in November. And so it 
would be nice if we could do a tour earlier in the year, you know, to make them five months apart or something.  
 
MM  23:58   
Enough time to make lots of work.  
 
EN  24:00   
And people come at different times. 
 
HN  24:02   
And how many art fair have to cut 
 
EN  24:06   
Sure. 
 
MM  24:06   
Yeah. Okay. 
 
HN  24:09   
Yeah. So this year is, you know, changing.  
 
MM  24:11   
Yeah. And learning.  
 
HN  24:13   
Learning, yeah. 
 
MM  24:14   
That's good. That's good. How many, how many people do you think might be involved in the tour? Do you know 
yet? Or do you have a group of people for the tour? 
 
HN  24:25   
For this tour? 
 
MM  24:26   
For the one that you might start? 
 
HN  24:29   
Invite our guests, or? 
 
MM  24:32   
Um, how many Rockford potters? 
 
EN  24:34   
Hosts? 
 
HN  24:35   
Hosts...  
 
EN  24:46   
Four, maybe five. 
 
HN  24:47   
Maybe five. 
 
EN  24:49   
And then hopefully we can invite guests, over time.  
 
HN  24:53   
Yeah. 
 
MM  24:53   
Yeah, okay.  
 
EN  24:55   
Kinda the thought.  
 
HN  24:56   
Well, maybe plus somewhere...  
 
MM  25:00   
A little further away? 
 
HN  25:02   
Yeah. We don't know which potter, close here, yeah. 
 
MM  25:08   
Well, I hope you'll tell me about it if it starts. I'd like to know about it.  
 
HN  25:13   
Yeah. Yeah. 
 
EN  25:13   
You'll be on it, right? 
 
MM  25:15   
I'll come and, I'll come and see if I can... See what I can learn, yeah. 
 
EN  25:22   
Learn? You've got to be on the pottery tour. 
 
MM  25:25   
I'll be touring, going around all the stops.  
 
HN  25:27   
Galena starts how many years ago? Ten? 
 
EN  25:30   
Twenty some? I don't know. 
 
HN  25:34   
Oh really, it's so old?  
 
EN  25:36   
It might be 16 
 
HN  25:36   
Cambridge is six years? seven years?  
 
EN  25:39   
The may tour is six or seven.  
 
HN  25:41   
Yeah,  
 
EN  25:41   
But the fall tour is like 25 or something.  
 
MM  25:44   
Yeah, I think Mark said it was 20 to 25 years.  
 
EN  25:47   
Right. 
 
MM  25:48   
He didn't remember, I think, the date.  
 
EN  25:50   
Right.  
 
MM  25:50   
So yeah. 
 
HN  25:50   
Yeah. Yeah. So this is a good place for the you know, go to, come to, Chicago you know, Madison. Maybe, 
Milwaukee, maybe, maybe not. 
 
EN  25:51   
Yeah, that's not that far. 
 
MM  26:04   
Yeah, well that's exciting. I hope it works.  
 
EN  26:07   
We'll see, we'll see. 
 
MM  26:08   
Have you, have you been to the tour in Galena?  
 
HN  26:12   
Yeah.  
 
MM  26:13   
Okay. Tha's a good group, too. 
 
HN  26:14   
Yeah, we enjoyed it. You? 
 
MM  26:17   
I haven't been to the tour, but I've met some of the people who participate. So yeah, I get to, I get to have better 
conversations if I go, not during the tour. 
 
HN  26:28   
Okay. 
 
MM  26:29   
But I want to go to the tour too. So you know, yeah.  
 
EN  26:32   
When the kids are grown up. 
 
MM  26:34   
Right? 
 
EN  26:34   
At least a little bit. 
 
MM  26:36   
So, no, I've been I've been working with the, the Michiana pottery tour.  
 
EN  26:42   
Yes. 
 
MM  26:42   
Since about 2012. I've been going up and just working very closely with them, documenting their work. 
 
EN  26:48   
Where is that? I can't remember which area. 
 
MM  26:49   
Mostly Goshen, Indiana.  
 
EN  26:51   
Okay. 
 
MM  26:52   
But it's also like, some have been in Elkhart, or closer to South Bend area, or in Michigan. 
 
EN  26:58   
Great, and how long, you said this is 2012 they started? 
 
MM  27:01   
They started in 2012. And that's when I met them. 
 
EN  27:04   
Great.  
 
MM  27:05   
Yeah. So you might ask them, too, because they started recently. Just about their experience, I don't know.  
 
EN  27:12   
And we're learning a lot from St. Croix people, too.  
 
MM  27:14   
I bet. That's a good place to learn from. 
 
EN  27:16   
Tough shoes to jump into. But really good. 
 
MM  27:20   
Yeah, yeah. Now, it's really fascinating that that tour has influenced a lot of the tours in the Midwest. I think a lot 
of people have learned from them.  
 
EN  27:30   
They do such an amazing job. And they're very, very open about how they do things. And it's "Yeah, do it. Do it." 
Very encouraging. 
 
MM  27:38   
Yeah, that's great. 
 
HN  27:38   
Yeah. 
 
MM  27:40   
That's exciting. Let me check my camera real quick. 
 
 
Video File #3 (afc2018030_05162_mv03.mp4) 
MM  0:00   
Just a couple more questions. As far as, I mean, the tour could be very exciting or Christmas sale. Do you have 
other plans for the future? Like how you want to grow or change your business? 
 
HN  0:15   
Ah, I think that's enough, right? Maybe, maybe in Japan future, right. Maybe use the gallery and exhibition with 
my friend. My classmate, you know. 
 
MM  0:33   
Yeah.  
 
HN  0:34   
When I study start learning pottery. He's very good. His piece is very nice. He's very, he love pottery. What's that, 
オタク. 
 
EN  0:49   
Ah, pottery nerd. 
 
HN  0:51   
Nerd. 
 
MM  0:53   
Okay.  
 
HN  0:53   
Yeah. Yeah. So, good. You know, he's older than me, but you know, good, good competition. What can I say, 
rival. 
 
EN  1:03   
Like you feed off of each other.  
 
HN  1:04   
Yeah. Yeah. Grow up, you know. 
 
EN  1:06   
Excites each other.  
 
MM  1:09   
What area does he work in?  
 
HN  1:10   
Kagoshima. 
 
MM  1:11   
Okay, yeah. 
 
HN  1:12   
Yeah, maybe local area. 
 
MM  1:13   
Yeah, yeah, that's great. Do you do get to visit?  
 
HN  1:17   
Yeah, yeah, we visit two years ago. 
 
EN  1:19   
We did once.  
 
HN  1:20   
Yeah. 
 
EN  1:21   
Hopefully we'll go again. 
 
HN  1:28   
Good food. 
 
EN  1:28   
They have two kids now. 
 
MM  1:29   
That's good, good. Well, I'm trying to think through, what are, for the two of you working together as a business, 
what are, or well, and running, you know, trying to run a business together. What are? What are some of the good 
things or the bad things about trying to, to coordinate that between two people? 
 
EN  2:01   
Do you have an answer? 
 
HN  2:04   
もんだい が あった 
 
EN  2:05   
私たち は 一緒 に 働いて いる でしょう、 いい ところ は それ それ の いい ところ わ なに? 
 
EN  2:16   
It depends on how you look at it. Yeah, because, I want to say, "Oh, this is a difficult part." But it's also a good 
part. If you're ready to grow as a person, then it is a really amazing opportunity to actually listen to your partner. 
And, and really try to understand what they're either saying or how they're doing their work. I, I used to nag. A 
lot. About "So when are you going to fire? So what are you making? So, so, so, so." And a few years ago, 
someone said, try not to say anything, just let him do whatever he needs to do, blah blah blah. And I did, it was 
really hard. But, he then had less stress. And, and he's an artist, he needs to do it on his own schedule. He knows 
what he has to do. You know, so it's my type A personality that had to pull back and say, "Okay, go ahead. I trust 
you. Hope it works out. Yay." So it's a really, way for us to grow as people. Really hard.  
 
MM  3:27   
Yeah.  
 
EN  3:28   
Really good. It's kind of like having children. 
 
MM  3:31   
Yeah, there's a lot you have to coordinate and... 
 
EN  3:34   
Yeah.  
 
MM  3:34   
Do you also have another job? Or is this your...  
 
EN  3:37   
Not really. I do a little bit of work for a company in Japan, just online. But I mean, I get an hour or two after they 
go to bed. And it's not, yeah, and it's only a couple times a year. But... if he would listen to me, 
 
HN  3:55   
What? 
 
EN  3:57   
it's really hard to work with an artist because they don't work on a schedule. And so I am not okay with last 
minute packing of pieces. And pricing at the fair when people are trying to buy and, you know, that's really hard 
too, but that's an artist. 
 
HN  4:13   
Yeah, but... but the new one can sell. 
 
EN  4:14   
What? New ones can sell, yeah. 
 
MM  4:17   
You've got different priorities. 
 
HN  4:20   
Yeah, I want to keep, yeah, 
 
EN  4:20   
Right. 
 
HN  4:20   
We do the same art fair every year. So people, you know, want, I feel, new one, you know, so that's why I make 
new stuff... 
 
EN  4:36   
But the other thing is, with him doing all the pottery. And with me doing all of the other stuff, it's very helpful, 
that I can do those things. He doesn't have to worry about the applications  
 
HN  4:49   
Yeah.  
 
EN  4:49   
Or the mailing list, or website, talking to customers, and the driving. 
 
HN  4:54   
Yeah, I can sleep. 
 
EN  4:56   
Well, right, so he will stay up all night the night before. And then open the kiln. He can't drive. So then I'm 
driving. But I mean, I know that a lot of artists don't have the second half, the other half. So they have to do half 
their time making pottery, half the time doing mailing lists, etc. If I do all that it really helps him to do, you know, 
24 hours of work. That's kind of how it is with you.  
 
HN  5:20   
Yeah. So next time, maybe we need apprentice or... they grow... 
 
MM  5:29   
Put them to work. Yeah, yeah. Do you think someday that you would like to have an apprentice? Maybe in the 
future?  
 
HN  5:36   
It depends, depends people. Yeah. 
 
EN  5:39   
Kinda unlikely. 
 
HN  5:41   
I want you know, my clone.  
 
EN  5:45   
And what I always say is, he wouldn't trust his clone. He always says, I need a clone. And I say you don't trust 
anyone, you wouldn't even trust your clone. 
 
HN  5:54   
Because, it's hard to tell the, what's that, the, what I want, you know. And sometimes changed, you know. 
Quickly. 
 
MM  6:06   
Yeah. 
 
HN  6:07   
Yeah. You, you will feel annoyed. This one. I want this way. 
 
EN  6:15   
I know, I know.  
 
MM  6:17   
It might be difficult to to try to teach someone. 
 
HN  6:20   
Yeah, and explain, you know.  
 
MM  6:23   
Do you, do you ever teach workshops or?  
 
HN  6:26   
I did once. I hate that. 
 
MM  6:30   
Okay, yeah, it's not for everyone. It's not for everyone.  
 
HN  6:33   
Yeah. 
 
MM  6:35   
Yeah 
 
EN  6:36   
Americans like to go from zero to teapots immediately. In Japan,  
 
HN  6:43   
And fun, you know.  
 
EN  6:44   
in his intensive course, he wedged clay only for an entire week, eight hours a day. And then he tested glazes only, 
you know, he centered only, for a week. 
 
HN  6:54   
I don't want that strict, you know. 
 
EN  6:58   
Well, I know. But the point is to you learned the basics well. 
 
HN  7:02   
Yeah, basics, yeah. 
 
EN  7:02   
And then you were able to move on. And so because the, the students weren't into that, he didn't like it. 
 
HN  7:09   
Oh, it means, mainly it means, I, we told them, you know, you guys know basics, right? They know. They said, 
they know, so. 
 
MM  7:23   
They think they know?  
 
HN  7:24   
Yeah, so, I'd like to do this. But you know, they can't. 
 
MM  7:30   
I see. Yeah. So and then you have to, you have to teach them other things. 
 
HN  7:34   
Yeah. And that is my first class, you know? Yeah. So I said, I'm not a teacher.  
 
MM  7:43   
Well, and not everyone is a teacher. So yeah. 
 
HN  7:48   
Yeah. I am maker. 
 
MM  7:51   
Sure, yeah. 
 
MM  7:54   
Well, thank you for making time for this. I really appreciate it.  
 
HN  8:00   
Yeah.  
 
MM  8:00   
I loved learning about your work, and all of this. I think that's all the questions I have right now. But I, I'd love to 
see the studio too, if there's time? 
 
HN  8:09   
Yeah. The basement is okay? Just...
