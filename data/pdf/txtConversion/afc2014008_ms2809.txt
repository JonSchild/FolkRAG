Congressman Frank Wolf

Washington,  D.C.

Dear Congressman Wolf,
 
3800 North Fairfax Dr.  #410
 
Arlington,  Va.  22203
 
June 21,  1995
 
I have been informed that an amendment was yesterday placed
 
on the portion of the House Appropriations Bill that deals
 
with the budget  for the Library of Congress requiring that
 
the annual  funds  for the American Folklife Center be
 
expropriated to pay for a Congressional study of the practice
 
of mandating legislation without  funding.
 
The American Folklife Center is a very small  section within
 
the Library of Congress;  it operates the Archives of American
 
Folk Song and the national Folk Archives.  These are
 
invaluable collections of the nation's historic patrimony;
 
the  former having been established as early as  1928.  Many
 
eminent Americans,  including my father,  John A.  Lomax,  and my
 
brother,  Alan Lomax,  have had the honor of being archivists
 
of these  important collections.
 
Eliminating the Center and its  irreplacable archives  for the
 
sake of a one-time activity such as a study of governmental
 
operations  seems absolutely bizarre,  and I urge you in the
 
strongest terms to remove this  ill-conceived amendment  from
 
the Appropriations bill.
 
Bess  Lomax Hawes
