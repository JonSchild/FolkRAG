CELEBRATED SPEECH OF ROBERT ENNET, 
Esq 
LEADER OF TIIE IRISH INSURRECTION OF 1803. 
My Lords,--I 
sin asked, what have I 
to say why sentence of 
death should not be pronounced on me, according to law ? I 
have nothing to say that can alter your predetermination, nor 
that it will become me to say, with any view to the mitigation 
of that sentence which you are to pronounce on me, and I 
must 
abide by. 
But I 
have that to say which interests me more than 
life, and which you have labored (as was necessarily your office 
in thepresent circumstances of this oppressed country) to destroy 
—I have much to say, why my reputation should be rescued 
from the load of false accusations and calumny which has been 
heaped on it. 
I 
do not imagine that seated where you are, your 
minds can be so free from impurity, as to receive the least im-
pression from what I 
am going to utter. 
I 
have no hope that I 
can anchor my character in the breast of a 
Court constituted 
and trammelled as this is. 
I 
only wish, and it is the utmost I 
expect, that your Lordships may suffer it to float down your 
memories untainted by the foul breath of prejudice, until it finds 
some more hospitable harbor to shelter it from the storm by 
which it is at present buffeted. 
Were I 
only to suffer death, after being adjudged guilty by 
your tribunal I 
should bow in silence, and meet the fate that 
awaits me without a 
murmur; but the sentence of the law which 
delivers my body to the executioner, will, through the ministry 
of that law, labor in its own vindication, to consign my charact-
er to obloquy; for there must be guilt somewhere ; whether in 
the sentence of Court or in the catastrophe, posterity must deter. 
mine. A man in my situation, my Lords, has not only to en-
counter the difficulties of fortune, and the force of power over 
minds which it has corrupted or subjugated,but the difficulties of 
established prejudice ; the man dies, hut his memory lives ; that 
mine may not perish—that it may live in the respect of my 
countrymen—I 
seize upon this opportunity to vindicate myself 
from some of the charges alleged against me. 
When my spirit 
shall be m 
afted to a 
more friendly port—when my shade shall 
have joined the bands of those martyred heroes who have shed 
11]

ROBERT EMMET'S SPEECH.— [CoxTiNuED. 
their blood on the scaffold and in the field, in defence of their 
country and of virtue, this is my hope— I 
wish that my memory 
and name may animate those who survive me, while I 
look down 
with complacency on the destruction of that perfidious govern-
ment, which upholds its dominion by blasphemy of the Most 
High; which displays its power over man as over the beasts of 
the forest; which sets man upon his brother, and lifts his hand 
in the name of God against the throat of his fellow, who be-
lieves or doubts a 
little more than the Government standard— 
s 
government steeled to barbarity by the cries of the orphans 
and the tears of the widows which it has made. 
(Here Lord Norbury interrupted Mr. Emmet— saying, that 
the mean and wicked enthusiasts who felt as he did, were not 
equal to the accomplishment of their wild design.) 
I 
appeal to the immacu'ate God—I 
swear by the throne of 
Heaven, before which I 
must shortly appear—by the blood of 
the mur&red patriots who have gone before me, that my con-
duct has been, throu2;11 all this peril and through all my pur-
poses, governed only by the convictions which I 
have uttered, 
and by no other view than that of their cure, and the emanci-
pation of my country from the superinhuman oppression under 
which she has so long and too patiently travailed ; an I 
I confi-
dently and assuredly hope that, wild and chimerical as it may 
appear, there is still union and strength in Ireland to accom-
plish this noblest enterprise. 
Of this I 
speak with the confidence of intimate knowledge, and , 
with the consolation that appertains to that confidence. 
Think 
not, my Lords. I 
say this for the petty gratification of giving 
you a 
transitory uneasiness ; a man who never yet raised his 
voice to assert a 
lie, will not hazard his character with posterity 
by asserting a 
falsehood on a 
subject so important to his coun-
try, and on an occasion like this. 
Yes, my Lords, a man that 
does not wish to have his epitaph written until his country is 
liberated, will not leave a 
weapon in the power of envy nor pre-
tence to impeach the probity which he means to preserve even 
in the grave to which tyranny consigns him. 
ROBERT EMMET'S SPEECH.—[CommTED. 
(Here he was again interrupted by the court.) 
Again I 
say, that what I 
have spoken was not intended for 
your Lordships, whose situations I 
commiserate rather than envy 
—my expressions were for my countrymen—if there is a 
true 
Irishman present, let my last words cheer him in the hour of af-
fliction. 
(Here he was again interrupted; Lord Norbury said he did 
not sit there to hear treason.) 
I 
have always understood it to be the duty of a 
judge, when 
a 
prisoner has been convicted, to pronounce the sentence of the 
law ; I 
have also understood that judges sometimes think it their 
duty to hear with patience, and to speak with humanity; to ex-
hort the victims of the laws and to offer, with tender benignity, 
his opinion of the motives by which he was actuated in the crime 
of which he was adjudged guilty. 
That a 
judge has thought it 
his duty so to have done, I 
have no doubt ; but where is the 
boasted freedom of yoar institutions 
where is the vaunted im-
partiality, clemency, and mildness of your courts of justice, if 
an unfortunate prisoner, whom your policy, and not your justice, 
is about to deriver into the hands of the executioner, is not suf-
fered to explain his motives sincerely and truly, and to vindicate 
the principles by which he was actuated. 
My Lords, it may be a 
part of the system of angry ;* stice to 
bow a 
man's mind by humiliation to the purposed ignominy of 
the scaffold—but worse to me than the proposed shame, or the 
scaffold's terrors, would be the shame of such foul and unfounded 
imputations as have been laid against me in this mut. 
You, my 
Lord, are a 
Judge ; I 
am the supposed culprit; I 
am a man; 
you are a 
man also; by a 
revolution of power, we 11 ight change 
places, though we never could change characters. 
If I 
stand at 
the bar of this court, and dare not vindicate my character, 
what a 
farce is yr ur justice. If I 
stand at this bar and dare not 
vindicate my character how dare you calumniate it ? 
Does the 
sentence of death, which your unhallowed policy inflicts upon 
my body, condemn my tongue to your silence, and my reputation

to reproach? 
Your executioner may abridge the period of my 
existence, but while I 
exist I 
shall not forbear tf- vindicate my 
character and my motives from your aspersions; and as a 
man, 
to whom fame is dearer than life, I 
will make the last use of that 
life in doing justice to that reputation which is.to live after me, 
and which is the on:y legacy I 
can leave to those I 
honor and 
love, and for whom I 
am proud to perish. 
Ns men, my Lords, we must appear on the great day at one 
common tribunal, and it will then remain for the Searcher of all 
Hearts to show a 
collective universe, who was engaged in the 
most virtuous actions or actuated by the purest motive—my 
country's oppressors, or 
(Here he was again interrupted, and told to listen to the sentence 
of the law.) 
My Lords, will a 
dying man be denied the legal privilege or 
exculpating himself, in the eyes of the community, of an unde-
served reproach thrchin upon him during the trial by chargiT , 
him with ambition, and attempting to cast away, for a 
paltry 
consideration, the liberties of his country? Why did your 
Lordship insult me ? or rather, why insult justice, in demanding: 
of me why sentence of death should not be pronounced against 
me? I 
know, my Lord, that form prescribes that you should asl. 
the question— the form also implies the right of answering. 
This, no dont'', may be dispensed with, and so might the whole 
ceremony of the trial, since sentence was already pronounced at 
the Castle, before your jury was empannelled. 
Your Lordships 
are but the priests of the Oracle, and I 
submit—but I 
insist jn 
the whole of the farms. 
(Here Mr. Emmet paused, and the Court desired him to pro-
ceed.) 
I 
am charged with being- an emissary of France. 
An emis-
sary of France t 
and for what end ? 
It is alleged that I 
wish to 
sell the independence of my country ! and for what end ? 
Was 
this the object of my ambition ? and is this the mode by which 
[

ROBERT EMMET'S SPERO11.— [CowTtNum 
tribunal of justice reconciles contradictions? No! I 
am no 
tmissary ; and my ambition was to hold a 
place among the deliv-
erers of my country—not in power, nor in profit, but in the glory 
of the achievement. 
Sell my country's independence to Franc3 
and for what ? Was it for a 
,,
hange of masters? 
No, but for 
ambition I Oh, my country! was it penonal ambiticn that 
could influence me? Had it been the soul of my actions, could I 
not, by my education and fortune — by the rank and considera-
tion of my family, have placed myself amongst the proudest of 
my country's oppressors? My country was my idol; to it I 
sac-
rificed every selfish, every endearing sentiment—and for it I 
now 
offer up my life. 
Oh, God I 
No my Lord: I 
acted as an Irish-
man, determined on delivering my country from the yoke of a 
foreign and unrelenting tyranny, and the more galling yoke of a 
domestic faction, which is its joint partner and perpetrator in the 
parricide, for the ignominy of existing with an exterior 
of 
splendor and a 
conscious depravity; it was the wish of my 
heart to ext ricate my country from this doubly-riveted despotism. 
I 
wished to place her independence beyond the reach of any 
power on earth—I 
wished to exalt her to that proud station in 
the world. 
Connection with France was, indeed, intended—but only as 
far as mutual interest would sanction or require. 
Were they to 
assume any authority inconsistent with the purest independence, 
it would be the signal for their destruction ; we sought rid, and 
we sought it as we had assurance we should obtain it—as auxili-
aries in war, and allies in peace. 
Were the French to come as invaders or enemies uninvited 
by the wishes of the people, I 
should oppose them to the utmost 
of my strength. 
Yes, my countrymen, I 
would meet them on 
the beach, with a 
sword in one hand, and a 
torch in the other; 
I 
would meet them with all the destructive fnry of war, and I 
would animate my countrymen to immolate them in their boats, 
before they had contaminated the soil of my country. 
If they 
succeeded in landing, and if forced to retire before superior dis-
cipline, I 
would dispute every inch of ground, burn every blade 
of grass beforo them, and the last entrenchment of liberty should 
[5]

ROBERT EMMET'S SPEECH.—(CorrixtraD. 
be my grave. 
What I 
could not do myself, if I 
should fall, I 
would leave as a 
last charge to my countrymen to accomplish, 
because I 
should feel conscious that life, anymore than death, is 
profitable 'when a 
foreign nation holds my country in subjection. 
But it was not as an enemy that the succors' of France were 
to land. 
I 
looked, indeed for the assistatiee of France; but I 
wished to prove to France and to all the world, that Irishmen 
deserved to be assisted ; that they were indignant at slavery, 
and ready to assert the independence and liberty of their 
country. 
I i 
ished to procure for my country the guarantee which 
Washington procured for America. 
To procnre an aid which, 
by its example, would be as important as its valor—disciplined, 
gallant, pregnant with science and experience, who would pre-
serve the good, and polish the rough points of our character; 
they would come to us as strangers and leave us as friends, after 
sharing our perils and elevating our destiny. 
These were my 
objects—not to receive new 
task-makers, but to expel old 
tyrants; these were my views, and these only became Irishmen. 
It was for these ends I 
sought aid from France, for France, 
even as an enemy, could not be more implacable than the enemy 
alrea 'y 
in the bosom of my country. 
(Here he was interrupted by the Court.) 
I have been charged with that importance in the efforts to 
emancipate my country, as to be considered the keystone of the 
combination of Irishmen, or as your lordship expressed it " the 
life and blood of the conspiracy." 
You do me honor over much 
you have given to the subaltern all the credit of a 
superior. 
There are engaged in this conspiracy, who are not only superior 
to me, but even to your own conception of yourself, my Lord. 
before the splendor of whose genius and virtues I 
should bow 
with respectful deference, and who would think themselves 
dishonored to be called your friend, and who would not disgrace 
themselves by shaking your blood-stained hand, 
(here he was again interrupted.)

What, my Lord I 
shall you tel me on the passage to that 
scaffold, which that tyranny (of which you are only the inter-
mediary executioner) has erected for my murder, that I 
am ac-
countable for all the blood that has an.I will be shed in this 
struggle of the oppressed against the oppressor— shall you tell 
me this, and shall I 
be so very a 
slave as not to repel it ?

do not fear to approach the Omnipotent Judge, to answer 
for the conduct of my whole lite, and am I 
to be appalled and 
falsified by a 
mere remnant of mortality here!

great reservoir, your Lordship might swim in it, 
(Here the judge interfered.) 
Let no man dare, when I 
am dead, to charge me with dis-
honor. 
Let no man attaint my memory, by believing that 
could have engaged in any cause but of my country, liberty and 
independence, or that I 
became the pliant minion of power, in 
the oppression or the miseries of my countrymen. 
The pro-
clamation of the Provisional Government speaks for our views, 
no inrerence can be tortured from it to countenance barbarity 
or debasement at home or subjection, humiliation, or treachery 
from abroad; I 
would not have submitted to a 
foreign oppressor, 
for the same reason that I 
would resist the present domestic op-
pressor. 
In the dignity of freedom, I 
would have fought on the 
threshold of my country, and its enemy should only enter by 
passing over my lifeless corpse 
And am r, who lived but for 
my court; ry, an 1

the jealous and watchful oppressor, and the bondaze of the grave,

to resent or repel it ? 
No, God forbid !

ROBERT EMMET'S SPEECH.—(CoNcLuDED. 
down with scrutiny upon the conduct of your suffering son, and 
see if I 
have, ever for a 
moment, deviated from those principles 
-of morality and patriotism which it was your care to instil into 
my youthful mind, and for which I 
am now to offer up my life. 
My Lord, you are impatient for the saciifice—the blood 
which you seek is not congealed by the artificial terrors that sur-
round your victim; it circulates warmly and unruffled through 
the channels which God created for a 
nobler purpose, but which 
you are bent to destroy for purposes so grievous that they cry to 
heaven I Be ye patient! 
I 
have but a 
few more words to say. 
I 
am going to my cold and silent grave: my lamp of life is 
nearly extinguished my race is run: the grave opens to receive 
me, and I 
sink into its bosom! I 
have but one request to ask at 
my departure from this world ; it is the charity of its silence 
Let no man writo my epitaph, for as no man who knows my 
motives dare now vindicate them, let not prejudice or ignorance 
asperse them. 
Let them and me repose in obscurity and peace, 
and my tomb remain unir:scribed, until other times, and other 
men can do justice to my character. 
When my country takes 
her place among the nations of the earth— then and not till 
then—let my epitaph be written. 
I 
HAVE nos. 
One day, previous to Emmet's trial, as the governor was going his 
rounds, he entered Emmet's r00111 rather abruptly, and observing a 
remarkabe expression in his countenance, he apologized for the in-
terruption. He had a 
fork fixed to his little deal table and appended 
to it there was a 
tress of hair, " You see." said he to the keeper, '• bow 
innocently I 
have been occupied; this little tress has long been dear 
to me, and I 
am plaiting it to wear in my bosom on the day of my ex-
ecution." On the day of that fatal event, there was found, sketched 
by his own hand with a 
pen and ink, upon that very table, an admi-
rable likeness of himself, the head severed from the body which lay 
near it, surrounded by the scaffold, the axe and all the pharapherba-
lia of a 
high treason execution. 
What a 
strange union of tenderness, 
enthusiasm and fortitude, do not the above traits of character exhib-
it ! 
his fortitude, indeed, never forsook him ; on the night previous 
to h 
s 
death, he slept as soundly as ever 
and when the fatal morning 
dawned, he arose. knelt down and prayed, ordered some milk, which 
im drank, wrote two letters, and then desired the sheriffe to he in-
formed that be was ready. 
When they came to his room, h said he 
had two requests to make ; one that his arms might be left as loose 
as possible, which was humunely acceded to. " I 
make the other," 
said he. " not under any idea that it can be granted, but that it may 
be held in remembrance that I 
have made it; it is, that I 
may lie per-
mitted to die in my green uniform." '
rids, of course, was not allowed 
him—and the request seemed to have no other object than to show 
that he gloried in the cause for which he had to suffer.

EllfEBIET'S DEATH. 
" 
He dies to-day," said the heartless judge, 
Whilst he sat him down to the feast, 
And a 
smile was upon his ashy lip 
As he uttered a 
ribald jest; 
For a 
demon dwelt were his heart should be, 
That lived upon blood and sin, 
And oft as that vile judge gave him food, 
The demon throbbed within. 
" 
He dies to-ray," said the gaoler grim, 
Whilst a 
tear was in his eye, 
" 
But why should I 
feel so grieved for him I 
Sure, I've seen many die! 
Last night I 
went to his stony cell, 
With the scanty prison fare— 
He was sitting at a 
table rude, 
Plaiting a 
lock ef hair I 
And he looled so mild, with his pale, pale face, 
And he spoke in so kind a 
way, 
'That my old breast heav'd with a 
smothering feel,' 
And I 
knew not what to say I" 
" 
He dies to-day,' thought a 
fair, sweet girl— 
She lacked the life to speak, 
For sorrow had almost frozen her blood, 
And white were her lip and cheek— 
Despair had drank up her last wild tear, 
And her brow was damp and chill, 
And they often felt at her heart with fear, 
For its ebb was all but still.

EMME 
C'S GRAVE. 
Ant :—" Wolfe Tone'. Grave." 
"Pray, tell me," I 
said. to an old man who staid, 
Drooping over the graves which his own Lands had made, 
"Pray, tell roe the name of the tenant that'sleeirs 
'Neath yonder lone shade. where the sad willow weeps? 
Every stone is engraved with the name °film dead, 
But you black slab declares not whose spirit is fled !" 
In silence be bowed, and then beckoned me nigh, 
'Till we stood o'er the grave—then he said with a sigh, 
" 
Yes, they dare not to trace e'en a 
word on this stone, 
To the memory of him who sleeps coldly and lone; 
He told them, commanded, the lines o'er his grave, 
Should never be traced by the band of a 
slave! 
•`He bade them to shade e'en his name in the gloom, 
Till the morning of freedom should shine on his tomb, 
' 
When the flag of my country at liberty flies, 
Then, then, let my name and my monument rise!' 
You see they obeyed him —' tis sixty-one years, 
And they still come to moisten his grave -with tl•eir tears! 
" 
He was young, like yourself, and aspired to o'erthrow 
The tyrants, who filled his loved island with woe ; 
They crushed him—this earth was too base, too confined, 
Too gross for the range of his luminous mind,"— 
The old man then paused, and went slowly away, 
And I 
felt, as he left me, an impulse to pray :— 
" 
Grant, Heaven ! I 
may see, ere my own nays are done, 
A monument rise o'er my country's lost son! 
And oh ! proudest task, be it mine to indite, 
The long delayed tribute a 
freeman must write; 
Till then shall its theme in my heart deeply dwell, 
So peace to thy slumbers !—dear Emmet, farewell! 
SONG OF THE IRISH-AMERICAN BRIGADE. 
Sung on St. Patrick's Day, 1863. 
We've never swerved from our old green flag 
Upborne o'er many a 
bloody plain ; 
'Tis now a 
torn and tattered rag. 
But we will bear it proudly oft again. 
We'll raise it high, this dear old flag, 
From Liffey's banks to Shannon's stream, 
Till victory o'er the pirate rag 
Upon our sacred cause shall beam. 
CHORUS. 
Hurrah! hurrah ! for ott r 
dear old flag, 
Hurrah for our gallant leader too ; 
Though ' tis a 
torn and tattered rag, 
We would not change it tor the new. 
We've borne it with the Stripes and Stars, 
From Fair Oaks to Frederick's bloody plain ; 
And see, my boys. our wounds and scars 
Can tell how well we did the same. 
But sure, our chieftain, of his race • 
Was ever foremost 'mid the brave, 
Where death met heroes lace to lace, 
And gathered harvests for the grave. 
Hurrah I 
hurrah ! &c. 
We miss full many a 
comrade's smile, 
The grasp of many a 
friendly hand, 
We mourn their loss, and grieve the while, 
They had not died for fatherland. 
But o'er their fresh and gory graves— 
We swear it now, and evermore--
To free green Erin, land of slaves, 
And banish tyrants from her shore. 
Hurrah ! Ii urrah I 
Now we're pledged to free this land, 
So long the exile's resting-place; 
To crush tor aye a 
traitorous band, 
And wipe out treason's deep disgrace. 
Then let us pledge Columbia's cause, 
God prosper poor old Ireland too I 
We'll trample on all tyrant laws: 
Hurrah tor the old land and the new. 
Hurrah! hurrah ! & c.

THE IIOUR THAT GOES BEFORE T il E DAWN'S 
THE DARKEST HOULL OF NIGHT . 
By JAMES O'BRIEN. 
Ale:—" Wearing of the Green." 
The gloom of seven centuries is hanging like a 
pall 
O'er the hearts of true and stalwart meu, in Irish lint and hall ; 
But iemember when the Tempest has his blackest flag unfurled, 
A radiant still is nearest, to intone a 
darkened wimbi ! 
Then arouse, 0111 Laud, take courage, keep this motto e'er in sight, 
The hour that goes before the dawn's the darkest hour of night! 
(Repeat two last lines.) 
When the love that thrills the gentle babe, forgets the mother's 
breast, 
And when the sailor, etorm-tossed, avoids a 
port of rest, 
When the captive on the galley chained, refuses to be free 
Then, Erin, of the Withered Brow, will we prove false to thee. 
'We'll not forget, when fortune frowns, and menaces the right, 
The hour that goes before the dawn's the darkest hour of night! 
(Repeat two last lines.) 
God bles'ed Owen Roe's Green Banner, when he smote Queen 
Bess's men, 
And He'll bless, when we assail the foe, that proud old Flag :' gain ! 
The law may call us THA1TOHS can banish us and kill. 
The bolt that strikes the Fenian down can't reach old Ireland's 
will; 
Then remember, when the battle's smoke conceals the foe from 
sight. 
The hour that goes before the dawn's the darkest hour of night! 
(Repeat two last lines.) 
The Saxon hordes may char our homes, and crimson Shannon's 
flood, 
A nobler train of peerless men shall spring from martyr's blood ! 
Be but prepared, and watch your chance. for CHANCES CONE and no, 
And when your master least expects, then strike him home the 
blow ! 
The gloom of death your vengeance spreads, shall prove the legend 
right. 
The hour that goes before the dawn's the darkest hour of night ! 
(Repeat two last lines.) 
To-mot row's work which must be done, should well be learne 
to. 
For they who fight, -when unprepared, hitt barter life away: 
When the troops are drilled, and fortune smiles, march ' neat Ii this 
stern decree, 
Our Flag we'll lower. ou sea or shore, to none, Great God, but Thee! 
Then shoulder arms, brothers all, f

When they might sleep in freemen's graves, 
Oh, who to alien yoke would bend, 
When battles' shock, that yoke might end ? 
Come, form, boys, form ! ' twere better rest 
In mother Erin's sheltering breast ; 
Than live to be, like serfs, oppress'd 
With countless wrongs all unredressed. 
Too long we've wept—our sighs and tears 
But met with laughter, scoffs, and jeers ; 
Our prayers were spurned, and tyrant lords 
Forbade our hopes, and banned our cause. 
But form, boys, form! we'll crouch no more, 
Our servile sleep, thank God 1 
is o'er, 
And soldiers now in freedom's corps, 
We stand to guard our native shore! 
Though cowards still in slavery whine, 
And traitors 'gainst the right combine; 
And hell scarce beat enough contains 
To punish those who'd break our chains. 
Still form, boys, form I

With all its demons, foul and fell, 
Our burning hopes and hearts can quell. 
Or keep us bound in thrarldorn: .s

From Antrim's cliffs to Shannon's banks,

In crushing us no clan doth know, 
All, all, alike, have known his frown, 
All, all, alike, must strike him down !

And down to earth forever drag 
The hated tyrant's crimson rag.

With rifle bright and glinting blade;

The cheering news has crossed the seas—it fills our soul; 
with joy— 
The croppy boys are in the field repeating " Fontenoy.' 
With the good old pike and sabre, to the rifle's ringing tune, 
They're slashing down the red-coats" ' tis the rising ot 
the Moon "— 
The campfires on the hills are lit, the " sunburst" is unfurled, 
And 'gainst the bloodstained pirate rag, their bold defiance 
hurled ; 
Right gallantly they meet the foe wherever he is seen, 
For Ireland, and for liberty— the Boys that wear the Green. 
They're mustering in silence 'mong the wilds of Innis-
howen ; 
And the Limerick boys are coming too, a-lilting Garryowen; 
Like the wintry blast careering o'er the heights of Sliev-

The men of Tipperary are madly rushing on. 
From Gorey to Berehaven's shore is heard time \wild hurra

Old Tara's hills have caught time shout, and the Galtees

And soon our old decrepit foe his countless crimes can rue. 
Throughout the land in solemn mass the dazzling sight is

Old Ireland up for Freedom, with the Boys that wear the

Her dear old voice is heard again, in thunder tones it speaks 
From old Ben Hedar's stormy heights, and Kerry's lofty 
Reeks; 
Time South is up, time West's awake, and trom the glorious 
North, 
As torrents sweep the mountain's side, her sons are coming

A Song ox Ninety-Eight. 
By D OIRE. 
From Howth away to famed Dunboy, 
By Kerry's beetling coasts, 
With lightning speed to summons flew 
To marshal Freedom's hosts; 
From Limerick's old, historic walls 
To Boyne's ill-omened tide, 
The long-watched signal swelled the hearts, 
With vengeance, hope, and pride. 
We ask, in vain, the right to live 
Here in our Native Land— 
The robber hordes oppress us more, 
And mock our just demand : 
Our sense of manhood must be dead, 
Our hearts turned into stone— 
That we thus crouch, while hearths and fanes 
Are round in ruins strewn. 
Then filly, out the Emerald Banner, 
Let the Orient kiss its hue, 
Beneath its fold we'll take our stand, 
To Erin, firm and true. 
The viper foes that wrought our woes, 
We'll meet them now with steel, 
And may the 11511(15 be shrivelled up 
That blow for blow won't deal. 
Hurrah ? God wills the time at last, 
Our galling chains to break, 
And in the cruel tyrant's blood 
Our thirsting swords to slake— 
Just heaven ! endow our arms with might, 
To strike down tyranny, 
And make the land we love so dear 
A Nation—great and free. 
They're must'ring fast. see Slievenamon 
Its serried lines displays. 
Mark how their burnished weapons gleam 
In morning's ruddy blaze : 
And proudly waves the flashing green, 
Where purl Maig and Lee— 
Hurrah my boys, we've lived, thank God, 
To make our Ireland free. 
We've sworn fealty to that cause 
Our martyrs sanctified ; 
To guard the Flag above our heads, 
We pledge our hearts' red tide. 
No more as craven slaves we'll bend 
To despot king or queen, 
God shield the Right—strike sure and fast, 
'Tis for our Native Green.

For there, in each encounter, the Eagle took the prize.

Whether tyrant, or coward, or knave. 
Great spirits who battled in old time 
For the freedom of Athens, descend 
As low to the shadow of Brian

From those that in far Alpine passes 
Saw Daithi struck down in his mail, 
To the last of our chiefs' galloghlasses, 
The saffron-clad foes of the Pale. 
Let us drink to the patriot brave— 
Ifurrah for the patriot brave 
But a 
curse and a 
blow be to liberty's foe, 
And more chains for the satisfied slave. 
Oh. Liberty I 
hearts that adore thee 
Pour of their best blood at. thy shrine, 
As freely as gushes before thee 
This purple libation of wine. 
For us, whether destined to triumph 
Or bleed as Leonidas bled, 
Crushed down by a 
forest of lances, 
On mountains of foreigner dead, 
May we sleep with the patriot bravo ! 
God prosper the patriot brave ! 
But may battle and woe hurry 1:berty's foe 
To a 
bloody and honorless grave!

By T. O'D. O'CALLAGHAN. 
Am :—" The Wearing of the Green." 
God bless the Green forever, 
Through the cycle of the years! 
Though dimmed its sheeny splendor is 
And stained with blood and tears ; 
'Tis the banner of dear Ireland--
The flag our fathers bore. 
When the Roman foe from sireland 
They chased in days of yore. 
God bless the Green forever! 
When brave Daithi led his men 
To victory 'mid Alpine snows. 
They proudly bore it then ; 
And when he sank a 
corpse before 
The lightning's fiery breath, 
They wrapped him in that banner, 
For he loved it unto death. 
And later still, how proud it waved 
On Clontart's bloody plain, 
When Brian smote the Danish horde, 
And burst the pirate chains; 
And when Malachi, the Valiant, flung 
That banner on the breeze, 
The robber Northman reeled and fled 
In terror o'er the seas. 
Once more how glorionFly it streamed 
O'er Luimneodes battle-towers, 
When Sarsfield slew the Saxon host, 
And Limerick was ours; 
Ere o'er the main the .* Wild Geese" flew, 
Far, far from land and all, 
To turn the scale on foreign fields, 
And curse the Saxon thrall. 
Again in days more nigh our own. 
At Fnntenoy ' twas spread, 
Where high in Heaven's light it waved 
O'r England's blood-stained Red;

it was a 
glorious sight— 
That cursed rag to see 
Sink down before Old Ireland's Green, 
And France's Fieur-de-lis 
And oh ! how thrilling lwas to hear 
Their clear ring out arnain, 
When rushing on the Briisth ranks, 
O'er trampled heaps of slain ; 
All honor to those exiles brave, 
May their menory never die, 
Who bore the Green to victory 
That day at Fontenoy. 
Hurall! the Green forever I 
Let it echo, let it roll, 
Till the clarion call of freedom 
Ring again from pole to pole, 
And Erin calls her exiles 
From the far land o'er the main 
To strike once more for native Right-
To beard the foe again. 
God bless the Green forever! 
'Tis the flag ot Ninety-eight— 
The flag McHugh O'Byrne bore 
To Dublin's Castle-gate ; 
'Es the banner of the Geraldines— 
Of O'Donnell— of O'Neill— 
Of martyred Emmet, Bourke, and Tone, 
True chieftains of the Gael. 
That flag defile ? Oi ! never ; 
Throte ,lt victory and defeat 
To the honor of that banner old 
Our lives we consecrate.

Ana our vows are not in vain— 
To raise the Green full high again 
On mountain, tower and plain.

DIED FOR THE GREEN—ELLEN HIGGINS. 
She died for the Green ! ere the rosebud 
Of childhood had fled from her cheek— 
Ere the heart that had loved Erin's emblem, 
That love in its fulness could speak; 
She ( lied for the Green ! by the angels 
Borne up trout the dull English earth 
Site was crowned with the smile of St. Brigid, 
And awoke to a 
heavenly birth. 
Oh, cold is the dark English city, 
No sunlight. en I 
iVeliS' the St reet, 
And the false, cheerless eye ot the Saxon 
At each winding and turning you meet ; 
Oh, Heavens! it once back in Ireland, 
To rest in its smile for a (lay— 
Alas ! from the smoke to the sunshine, 
We send forth the children to play. 
So out from the choke and the darkness, 
Three child-maidens merrily went, 
To see what. the bright sun was doing— 
To see what the summer had sent ; 
And they wore in th(*.ir hats the Green ribbon, 
For love of the tar away land— 
For love of the homestead forsaken. 
The mountain, the valley, and strand. 
And they smiled when they saw the dear sunshine, 
In Ireland it shines brighter still— 
" 
How pleasant it danced, Kate and Mary, 
In the river by Carrawe's Mill ;" 
So the 
caroled along, dreaming strangely 
Of beauty on Ireland's shore, 
When the cubs of the Saxon (lain marked them, 
With their throats thirsting madly for gore. 
No— never the Green would they lower, 
And two fly away like the wind ; 
But the stroke ot the slayer has smitten 
The truest and bravest behind; 
With the Green in her hat she has fallen, 
No foul haml shall sully its hue— 
! 
would that the strong men of Ireland, 
Were, as young Ellen Higgins, as true. 
She died for the Green ! all is over— 
The last martyr golte to the clay— 
With a 
feeling of sadness and vengeance 
We sing the proud story to-day. 
Oh ! mothers of Ireland, when bending 
Above your young darlings with pride, 
Remember how deep in black England 
For the Green this brave child-exile died.

THE IRISH-AMERICAN. 
Colnmbia the free is the land of my birth, 
And tuy paths have been all on American earth ; 
But my blood is as Irish as any can be. 
And my heart is with Erin afar o'er the sea. 
My father, and mother, and friends all around, 
Are daug ters and sons of the sainted old ground— 
Thoy rambled i 
ts ; tight plains and in 
among, 
And filled its fair valleys with laugh and with song. 
Bnt I 
sing their sweet music, and often they own 
It. is true to old Ireland in style and in tone ; 
I 
dance their gay dances, and hear them with glee 
Say each touch tells of Erin afar o'er the sea. 
I 
have tufts of greel shamrock in sods they brought o'er, 
I 
have shells they picked up ere they stepp'd from the shore., 
I 
have books that are treasures ; the fondest I 
hold 
Is ‘• Th ; Melodies," clasped and nigh covered with gold. 
My pictures are pictures of scenes that are dear, 
For the beauties they are, or the glories they were. 
And of good men and, great men whose met its shall be 
Long the pride of green Erin afar o'er the sea. 
If I 
were in beautiful Dublin to•day. 
To the spots I 
hold sacred I'd soon find my way, 
For I 
know where O'Connell and Cturran are laid, 
And where loved Robert Emmet :--leeps cold ". in the shade." 
And if I 
were in Wexford—bow fondly l'd trace 
Each field I 
have marked tot my maps of the place, 
wh ere th e brave Ninety-Eight men poured hotly and free 
Tueir blood for dear Erin afar o'er the sea. 
Dear home of my fathers ! I'd bold theo to blame, 
And my cheeks would at times take the crimson of shame, 
Did thy sad tale not show, in each Sorrow- stained line, 
That the might of thy tyrant was greater than thine. 
But her soldiers are many, abroad and at home, 
Iler ships on all oceans are ploughing the foam. 
And her wealth is untold— sure no equal was she 
For my poor plundered Erin afar o'er the sea, 
Yet they tell me the strife is not yet given o'er— 
That the gaPant old Island will try it mu.° more ; 
And will (- all, with her harp, when her flag s 
tinforl'd, 
Her sons, anti their sons, from the ends of the world. 
If so. I've a 
rifle, that's true to a 
hair. 
A 
brain that can plan and a 
band that can dare; 
And the summons will scarce have died out, when I'll be 
'Mid the green fields of Erin afar o'er the sea.

THE BATTLE EVE OF THE BRIGADE. 
The mess-tent is full, and the glasses are set, 
And the gallant Count Thomand is president yet, 
The verran aroie, like an uplifted lance, 
Crying—" Comrades, a 
health to the mo arch of France ! 
With bumpers and cheers they have done as he bade, 
For King Louis is lov'd by the Irish Brigade. 
" 
A health to King James," and they bent as they quafrd, 
Here's to George the Elector," and fiercely they laugh'd. 
"Good luck to the girls we wood long ago, 
Where Shannon, and Barrow, and Blackwater flow ;" 
" 
God prosper Old Ireland," you'd think them afraid, 
So pale grew the chiefs of the Irish Brigade. 
64 But surely that light cannot come from our lamp? 
And that noise—are they all getting drunk in the camp r 
"Hurrah ! boys, the morning of battle is come, 
And the generale's beating on many a 
drum." 
So they rush from the revel to join the parade, 
For the van is the right of the Irish Brigade. 
They fought Ps they revell'd, fast, fiery, and true, 
Anti, though victors, they left on the field not a 
few; 
And they who surviv'd, fought and drank as of yore, 
But the land of their heart's hope they never saw more, 
For in far foreign fields, from Dunkirk to Belgrade, 
Lie the soldiers and chiefs of the Irish Brigade.

About the•-• 1

Not British seas nor B' it

Can match the matt of Tippetary. 
Tall in his form, his heart is warm, 
His spirit light as any ( airy— 
Ills

That sweeps the 11 ills of Tipperary. 
Lead him to fight for waive land, 
His is no courage cold and wary ; 
The troops live not on eat th would stand 
The headlong charge of Tipperary. 
Yet meet him in his cabin rude, 
Or dancing with his dark-hair'd Mary, 
You'd swear they knew no other mood, 
But mirth and love in Tipperary. 
You're free to share his scanty meal, 
His plighted word he'll never vary— 
In vain they tried with gold and steel, 
To shake the faith of Tipperary. 
Soft is his cuilin's sunny eye, 
Her mien is mild. her step is airy, 
Her heart is fond, her soul is high— 
Oh 
she's the pride of Tipperary. 
Let Britian, too, her banner brag, 
We'll lift the Green more proud and airy ; 
Be mine the lot to bear that flag, 
And head the men of Tipperary. 
Though Britain boasts her British hosts, 
About them all right little care we— 
Give us to guard our native coasts, 
The matchless men of Tipperary.

Then let us raise to Grattan's praise, 
A proud and joyous anthem ; 
And weahh, and grace, and length of days 
May God in mercy grant him.

APRIL 20TH, 1864. 
There years ago to-day 
We raised our hands to Heaven, 
And 03 the rolls of muster 
Out names were thirty-seven: 
There were just a 
thousand bayonets, 
And the swords were thirty- even, 
And we took oath of service 
With our right hands raised to Heaven. 
Oh 'twas a 
gallant day, 
In memory still adored, 
That day of our sun-bright nuptials 
With the musket and the sword 1 
Shrill rang the fifes, the bugles blared, 
And beneath a 
cloudless Heaven 
Twinkled a 
thousand bayonets, 
An,t the swords were thirty-seven. 
Of the thousand stalwart bayonets 
Two hundred marched to-day 
Hundreds lie in Virginia await ps, 
And hundreds in 11lar land clay; 
And other hundreds, less happy, drag 
Their shattered limbs arth.nd. 
And envy the deep, long, b'essed sleep 
Of the battle-field's holy ground. 
For the swords—one night, a 
week ago, 
The remnant, just eleven, 
Gathered around a 
banqueting board 
With seats for thirty-seven. 
There were two limped in on crutches, 
And two bad each but a 
hand 
To pour the wine and raise the cup, 
As we toasted " Our flag and land." 
And the room seemed filled with ‘‘ bispers 
As we looked at the vacant sears. 
And, with clio,:ing throats, we pushed aside 
The rich but untasted meats ; 
Then in silence we brimmed our glasses, 
As we rose up—just eleven, 
And bowed as we drank to the loved and the dead 
Who had made us TUIRTY-SEVEN

THE MARTYR. 
On the dread tempest-wing over the stormy sea, 
And fearful paths tintrod. 
Past ships and fleets, whose pride and chivalry, 
Bowed to the might of God. 
From the far jewelled " Eldorado " of the west— 
To a 
dethroned queen's poor hopeless breast, 
Came news that darkly bode. 
The tale to her bleeding heart is quickly told— 
Her exiled son is dead— 
Deep, in the starry land of corn and gold, 
They've pdlowed his weary head ; 
There 'neath the hickory trees and waving lime% 
And hemlocks dark, where creeping ivy climbs, 
Is made his dreamless bed. 
He sunk to rest, with hopeful, trusting prayer, 
For his queen mother-land— 
She, for whose weal his fiery love did dare 
Fetters and felon brand ; 
In his proud youth his hopes were round her wreathed 
And his last sigh of ebbing life was breathed— 
For her, proscribed and banned. 
Now, from her bruised heart the poor horn queen, 
Over the wild sea's surge, 
Pours out, with pallid lips, the dismal caoine— 
Her dead son's dirge; 
List! 0 
ye thronged heavens, to her song of woe, 
Pity her anguished soul—her tears that flow— 
Avert thy scourge. 
" 
My son is dead !—my beautiful, my brave, 
Gone to his peaceful sleep ; 
And strangers laid my darling in his grave ; 
Therefore, I 
moan and weep. 
Oh! how he loved me—oh ! but his heart was true, 
And his words were balm, soft as the blessed dew 
On the harebells deep.

DEATH OF SAILSFIELD. 
Sarsfield has sailed from Limerick town— 
He held it long for country and crown, 
And ere he ielded the Saxon swore 
To spoil our homes and our shrines no more. 
Sarsfield and all his chivalry 
Are fighting for France in the Low Country— 
At Iris fiery charge the Saxon reel ; 
They learnt at Limerick to dread the steel. 
Sarsfield is dying on Landen's plain, 
His corslet bath met the ball in vain— 
As his life-blood gushes into his hand, 
He says, " Oh, that this was for Fatherland." 
Sarsfield is dead, yet no tears shed we— 
He died in the arms of victory. 
And his dying words shall edge the brand 
When we chase the foe from our native land. 
THE EMERALD ISLE. 
Alas! border minstrel, the summons is vain, 
For unstrung is the harp, and forgotten the strain 
Which Erin once snug in her pride; 
And now, robbed of the glories that circled her reign, 
To the heartrending clank of a 
conqueror's chain, 
All tuneless she wanders the desolate plain, 
With the blood of her patriots dyed ! 
Gone, gone are the days when the western gala 
Awoke every voice of the lake and the vale, 
With the harp, and the lute, and the lyre! 
When justice uplifted her adamant shield, 
While valor and freedom illumin'd the field, 
And thy free-born sous made the foemen to yield, 
With a 
sword and a 
plumage of fire! 
And now, border minstrel, the bigot and slave 
Pollute the pure land of the free-born brave, 
The land of the sigh and the smile!— 
Then accurs'd be the recreant heart that. could sing, 
And withered the hand that would waken a 
string, 
Till the angel of Liberty waves her wild wing' 
Again o'er the Emerald Isle!

THE BATTLE OF BEAL-AN-AT 
iffA-BUIDHE. 
By O'Neil close beleagur'd the spirits mighty droop 
Of the Saxon—three hundred shut up in their coop, 
Till Bag,enal drew forth his Toledo, and swore 
On the sword of a 
soldier, to succor Port Mor. 
His veteran troops in the foreign wars tried— 
Their features how bronz'd, and how haughty their stride— 
Stept steadily on ; it was thrilling to see 
That thunder-cloud brooding o'er Beal-an-atha-buidhe. 
The flash of their armor, inlaid with fine gold— 
Gleaming matchlocks and cannon that mutteringly roll'd— 
With the tramp and the clank of those stern cuirassiers, 
Died in blood of the Flemish and French cavaliers. 
And are the mere Irish with pikes and with darts— 
With but glibb-cevered heads, and but rib-guarded hearts— 
Half-naked, half- fed, with few muskets; no guns— 
The battle to dare against England's proud sons! 
Poor Bonnachts, and wild Gallowglasses, and Kern— 
Let them war with rude brambles, shard furze, and dry fern 
Wirrastrue for their wives— for their babes ochanie, 
If they wait for the Saxon at Beal-an-atha-buidhe. 
Yet O'Neil atandeth firm—few and brief his eommanda— 
" 
Ye have hearts in your bosoms, and pikes in your hands; 
Try how far you can push them, my children, at once; 
Fag an Bealach—and down with horse, foot, and great guns. 
They have gold and gay arms—they have biscuit and bread; 
Now, sons of my soul, we'll be found and be fed ;"

THE FORLORN HOPE. 
Let us lift the green flag high 
Underneath this foreign sly, 
1Throl the verdant volume to the wind. 
As we hasten to the fight 
Let us drink a 
last good night 
To the beauty which we leave, boy, behind, behind, behind; 
To the beauty which we leave, boy, behind. 
Plant it high upon the breach, 
And within the tlag-staft's reach; 
We'll offer it the tribute of our gore, 
Yes! on that altar high, 
'Spite ot tyrants we can die, 
And our spirits to the saints above may sear, soar, soar, 
And our spirits to the saints above may soar. 
Liberty is gone, 
Now ' tis glory leads us on, 
And spangles gloomy slavery's night; 
If freedom's shattered bark 
Has not foundered i' the dark, 
Her wreck must see this beacon bright, bright, bright; 
Her wreck will see this beacon bright, 
Yes; glory's shining light 
Must irradiate the night, 
And renew the flaming splendour of the day 
And freedom's sinking crew 
Shall recover hope anew. 
And hail the blazing splendour of this ray, ray, ray. 
And hail the blazing splendour of this ray. 
The green flag on the air, 
Sons of Erin ne'er despair, 
To the breach in serried column quick advance. 
On the summit we may fall; 
Hand and hand, my comrades all, 
Let us drink a 
last adieu to merry France, France, France 
Let us drink a 
last adieu to merry France. 
To Erin, comrades, too. 
And her sunny skies of blue, 
A goblet commingled with tears!

But the Ancient see the Sunburst rears, rears, rears;

IRISH ARE NO LONGER SLAVES. 
When Britain first at bell's command, 
Prepar'd to cross the Irish main,

prophet in our land. 
'Mid traitors' scoff an ,I

"If Brit-nnia, Britannia cross the waves,

Shall bruise your heart, and sere our brain 
Lost Isle ! with matchless beauty crown'd, 
But wanting strength to break your chain, 
If Britannia, Britannia cross the waves, 
Irish ever shall be slaves." 
In vain the warning patriot spoke, 
In treach'rous guise Britannia came— 
Divided, bent us to her yoke. 
Till Ireland rose, in Freedom's name, 
And Britannia, Britannia boldly braves. 
Irish are no longer slaves I 
THE VOW OF TIPPERARY. 
From Caerick streets to Shannon shore, 
From Slievenamon to Ballindeary, 
From Longford Pass to Gaillte Mor,

Too long we fought for Britain's cause, 
And of our blood were never chary;

And thinned the homes of Tipperary. 
Too long with rash and single arm, 
The peasant strove to guard his eyrie,

MACKENNA'S DREAM. 
One night of late I 
chanced to stray, 
When all the green in slumber lay, 
The moon sunk in the deep; 
I 
sat upon a 
ruined mound, 
And while the wild wind whistled round, 
The ocean, with a 
solemn sound, 
Lull'd.me fast asleep. 
I 
dreamt I 
saw that hero true, 
Who did the Danish force subdue, 
ills sabre bright, with wrath he drew, 
These words he said to me; 
The Harp, with rapture, yet shall sound, 
My children's chains shall be unboun3, 
And they shall gather safe around 
The blooming laurel tree." 
I 
thought brave Sarsfield drew up nigh 
And to my question made reply ; 
" 
For Erin's cause I'll live and die 
As thousands did before. 
My sword again on Aughrim's plain 
Old Erin's rights shall well maintain, 
Through millions in the battle slain, 
And thousands in their gore." 
I 
thought Saint Ruth stood on the ground. 
And said, " I'll be your monarch crowned, 
Encompassed by the French around 
All marching to the field ;" 
He raised a 
Cross, and thus did say, 
" 
Brave boys, we'll show them gallant pity ; 
Let no man dare disgrace the day, 
We'd die before we yield." 
The brave OTyrne, he was there, 
From Ballymanus, bright and fair, 
Brought Wicklow, Carlow, and Kildare, 
To march at his command; 
[1] 
MACKENNA'S DREAM.—[CONTINUED. 
Westmeath and Caven too did join, 
The county Louth men crossed the Boyne, 
Slane, Trim, and Naval' too did join 
With Dublin to a 
man. 
O'Reilly, on tile hill of Screene, 
lie drew his sword, both bright and keen, 
And swore by all his eyes had seen, 
He would avenge the fall 
Of Erin's sons and daughters brave, 
Who nobly filled a 
martyr's grave, 
And died, rather than live a 
slave, 
And still for vengeance call. 
Then Father Murphy came to say, 
'• Behold my lord rI41 here to-day, 
With eighteen thousand pikemen gay, 
From Wexford's hills mid caves; 
Our country's fate, it sure depends 
On us, and on our gallant friends, 
And heaven will their cause defend, 
Who ne'er were willing slaves." 
I 
thought the band played " Patrick's Day," 
To marshal all in grand array ; 
With cap and feather, white and gay 
They marched in warlike glow. 
With drums and trumpets loud and shrill, 
And cannon upon every hill, 
And pikemen, who, with valor thrill 
To strike the fatal blow. 
When all at once appeared in sight 
An army clad in armor bright, 
Both front, and rear, and left, and right, 
Marched Paddies evermore.

MACKENNA'S DREAM.—[CONCLUDED. 
The chieftains pitched their camps wtth skill, 
Determined tyrants' blood to spill, 
Beneath us ran a 
mountain rill, 
As rapid as the Nore. 
A Frenchman brave rose hp and said, 
"Let Erin's sons be not dismayed, 
To glory I'll the vanguard lead, 
r1() honor and renown. 
Come, bravely draw your swords with me, 
And let each tyrant bigot see 
Dear Erin's daughters must be free 
Before the sun goes down." 
Along the line they raised a 
shout, 
Crying, " Quick march, right about; 
With bayonets fixed they :di marched out. 
To thee the deadly foe. 
The enemy were no ways shy, 
With thundering cannon planted nigh ; 
Now thousands in death-struggle lie, 
And streams of crimson flow. 
The enemy made such a 
square, 
As drove our cavalry to despair; 
Who were nigh routed, rank and rear, 
But yet not forced to yield. 
The Wexford boys that ne'er were slack, 
Came with the brave Tips at their back, 
With Longford joined, who in a 
crack, 
Soon sent them off the field. 
They gave three cheers for liberty, 
As the enemy all broken flee; 
I 
looked around but could not see, 
One foeman on the plain, 
Except the men who wounded lay. 
When I 
awoke ' twas break of day, 
So ends Mat:Kelm:CS dream.

THE MYRTLE AND SHAMROCK. 
By PATRIC( us (P. 
J.. 
O'KENNEDY.) 
The Myrtle blooms in foreign bowers, 
It gives its perfume to the air 
Beneath Sicilia's balmy showers, 
And by Sorrento fair ; 
It waves above the martial slain, 
fly gentle breezes fanned, 
In blue Ansonia's c!inte, and Spain— 
The minstrel's favored land. • 
The virgins meet beneath its shade, 
The lovers tell their tale, 
NVIten moonlight lends its genial aid, 
To make its force prevail; 
And many a 
lay of olden rhyme 
Have bards beneath it sung, 
In sweet Italia's sunny clime, 
In Tasso's native tongue. 
Yet more I 
prize the shamrock green, 
That springs from Irish sod; 
For in its triple leaves :re seen 
An emblem of the God 
Who reigns in triune majesty 
On his supernal throne; 
Where radiant seraphs bend the knee, 
And all his glories own. 
For Erin's saint, as legends tell, 
Its triple blossoms chose, 
To prove this truth. still chershed well 
Through Erin's countless woes; 
And hence we prize the emblem fair, 
And love its emerald green ; 
And Ireland's sons its leaves shall wear 
In every clime and scene. 
'Tis Spring— and blithe from spray to spray 
The winged musicians hop, 
Uniting in a 
roundelay, 
As if they all were UP. 
Each plant erects its pendent head, 
Each flower expands its cup; 
The very weeds in every bed 
Set impudently UP. 
There's not a 
tree in wood or grove 
That waves its branchy top, 
Which does not hi,ist the badge of love 
And union boldly UP. 
The brambles on the Lighway side, 
A numerou4, hardy crop. 
So long kept down by winter's pride, 
Spring amicably UP. 
The tenants of the crystal stream 
Their heads above it pop! 
As if they wanted to exclaim, 
"See, Neighbours, we are UP." 
Each bill now cocks its crest on high 
As any martial fop, 
While every valey seems to cry, 
" 
Come down, and help us UP." 
The progress of this rising age, 
No human power can stop— 
Then, Tyrant, cease your war to wage ; 
for NATURE WILL BE UP.

THE GREEN ABOVE TILE BED 
BY TII0MAS DAVI& 
Am: " Irish Molly 0 
l" 
Full often when our fathers saw the Red above the Green. 
They rose in rude- 
but fierce array, with sabre, pike, and sei 
Arid over many a 
noble town, and many atofield of dead, 
They proudly set tke Irish Green above the English Red. 
But in the end, throughout the land, the shameful sight was 
seen— 
The English Red in triumph high above the Irish Green; 
But well they died in breach and field, who, as their spirits fled, 
Still saw the Green maintain its place above the English Red. 
And they who saw, in after times, the Red above the Green, 
Were withered as the grass that dies beneath the forest screen; 
Yet often by this healthy hope their sinking hearts were fed, 
That, in some day to come, the Green should flutter o'er the Red. 
Sure it was for this Lord Edward died, and Wolfe Tone sunk 
serene— 
Because they could not bear to leave the Red above the Green; 
And 'twas for this that Owen fought, and Sarsfield nobly bled— 
Because their eyes were hut to see the Green above the Red. 
So, when the strife began, our darling Irish Green 
Was down upon the earth, while high the English Red was seen ; 
Yet still we hold our fearless course for something in us said, 
"Before the strife is o'er you'll see the Green above the Red." 
And 'tis for this we think and toil, and knowledge strive to glean, 
That we may pull the English Red below the Irish Green. 
And leave our sons sweet Liberty, and smiling plenty spread 
Above the land once dark with blood—the Green above the Red/ 
The jealous English tyrant now has banned the Irish Green, 
And forced u -4 
to conceal it like a 
something ford and mean ; 
But yet, by Heavens! he'll sooner raise his victims from the dead 
Than force our hearts to leave the Green and cotton to the Red.

Paddy dear, and did you hear the news ,that's going round 
The shamrock is forbid, by law, to grow on Irish ground I 
No more St. Patrick's day we'll keep, his color last be seen; 
For, there's a 
bloody law agin the Wearing of the Green 1 
Oh! I 
met with Napper Tandy, and he took me by the hand, 
And he says: How is Ould Ireland, and how does she stand ? 
She's the most distressed Country that ever I 
have seen: 
For, they are hanging men and women for the Wearing of the 
Green! 
And since the color we must wear, is England's cruel red, 
Ould Ireland's sons will ne'er forget the blood that they have 
have shed. 
Then take the shamrock from your hat, and cast it on the sod: 
It will take root and flourish still, tho' under foot 'tis trod. 
When the law can stop the blades of grass from growing as 
they grow. 
And when the leaves, in summ6-. time, their verdure does not 
show. 
Then, I 
will change the color I 
wear in my cabbeen: 
But, till that day, plaze God! I'll stick to the Wearing of the 
Green I 
But if at last, her colors should be torn from frelayadie heart 
Her sons, with shame and sorrow, from the dear old soil will 
part; 
I've heard whispers of a 
Country that lies far beyond the say. 
Where rich and poor stand equal, in the light of Freedom's.
