PROBABLY few performers have met with as great suc-
cess as the object of our short sketch. 
He was born in 
London, England, in the year 1844; he came to this 
country and opened at Carr's Melodeon, Buffalo, N. Y., 
where for two months he was a 
great favorite; he then 
joined Carter's Zottave troupe, remained a 
season, then 
opened at Fox's, Philadelphia, and then at Barnum's 
Museum, N. Y., where his engagement proved a very 
successful one, remaining there for two months. 
From 
there he went to the Seventh Street Opera House, where, as 
before, the public of Philadelphia turned out to greet their 
favorite. 
From there, harry joined Charley Pettengill's 
Ministrels, and through the Eastern States was a 
great 
favorite. 
Harry has a 
specialty in the Instrumental 
act, playing sixteen instruments, and in the act, the 
press pronounce him unequalled. • His original act, " the 
Flying Scud," was the fruit of long months of study, 
bringing out the great mechanical donkey. 
As an author 
and poet, few have composed more ditties and ballads fol.' 
the public. 
He also does the act of playing on eight in-
struments all at once. 
In deportment, Mr. Robinson is a 
gentleman, and a 
warm friend. 
He is always on the alert 
for novelty, and we vouch for him the greatest success 
ever accorded to one of his profession.

HARRY ROBINSON'S 
SONGSTER. 
OH, DON'T YOU WISH YOU WAS MR 
A comic. Song and Dance, composed by H ARRY ROBINSON, 
of 
CHARLIE PETENGILL'S Minstrels. 
011, don't you think I 
am looking quite nice, 
I 
feel so jolly and free; 
I 
come before you to make you laugh 
And scream, so look at me. 
I 
am not the handsomest you ever saw, 
-But my figure is rather grand; 
I 
can do as I 
like and go where I 
please, 
And live on the fat of the laud. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, me, oh, my, I 
feel so jolly and free, 
Oh, me, oh, my, don't you wish you was me 
This hump you all see upon my back, 
Was caused one day by a 
fall; 
My eye is black as you can see, 
Yet I 
am happy after all. 
My collars are made of thick card board, 
My clothes how nice they fit ; 
10 
THE SOAP 
AT SERGEANT. 
My feet are small, but my shoes large, 
They feel so nice when they slip. 
Oh, me, oh, my, etc. 
My cap is one of the latest fashion—. 
It's a 
good one for the sum; 
I 
hope my song will please you all, 
For I 
have nearly done. 
Now, here's my gloves, how nice they fit, 
They look rather empty; 
There was a 
time I 
could wear fives, 
But these are number twenty. 
Oh, me, oh, my, etc. 
THE SOAP FAT SERGEANT. 
A Banjo Solo, written by HAnur Roancsorr, and sung by him with 
great success. 
Now I'll sing to you a 
doleful tale, 
If you'll listen to this ditty ; 
It's about an oyster peddualer 
That lived in this ere city. 
He fell in love with a 
nice young girl, 
Her ways were rather queer; 
She used to call out soap fat, 
And peddle lager beer. 
Her parents, they were wealthy, 
So I 
tell it, the truth must be ; 
Her father was orderly sergeant, 
In a 
soap fat factory; 
Her mother she sold hot corn all night, 
And drank hot gin all day; 
And the brother was shot in the back 
At Bull's Run trying to run away. 
THE RETURNED SOLDIER. 
11 
When the father came to hear of this, 
It gave him a 
terrible shock; 
Be bought him a 
musket for sixteen cents, 
Without any barrel or lock; 
He loaded it up with green peas, 
Determined to serve him a 
trick ; 
The very next day he blew out his brains, 
And killed himself dead with a 
brick. 
When the mother came to hear of this, 
She went in a 
fit of stereen, 
And poisoned herself the next day 
With a 
gallon of kerosene; 
When the daughter came to hear of it, 
She went right out of her head, 
She took a 
dose of croton oil 
And with it she died-i-ed. 
THE RETURNED SOLDIER. 
Written and sung by H ARRY ROBINSON. 
Now I'm a 
true soldier I 
want you to know, 
'When the war first broke out I 
was willing to go, 
To fight for my country like other brave men. 
If there was a 
war to-morrow I'd go out again; 
I 
lost my left arm, as you can all see, 
Fighting in defence of our great country; 
Our roof was the sky, our bed a 
hard stone, 
And oft I 
have lain and heard my comrades groan. 
ClIORLTS. 
Now I'm a 
soldier true I 
want you all to know, 
If there was a 
war again, of course I 
would go. 
Our leaders were good men, and good in their art, 
There's Grant and Phil. Sheridan both did their part; 
12 
THAT'S THE WAY WE GO. 
How could they fail in such a 
glorious cause, 
They will stick for the Union and obey all the laws ; 
When the bugle would sound we would luickly turn out, 
And fall in a 
line and to the " right about; " 
And what was our comfort, and what was our life'? 
We fought for the Union, our children and wife. 
Now, I'm a, etc. • 
THAT'S THE WAY WE GO. 
As sung by CHARLIE PETENGILL and HARRY ROBINSON, with 
great success. 
SOME folks go crazy after dollars, 
Tight pants and Shakspeare collars; 
And after all the pretty girls follows 
As they go marching by. 
" 
Under the gaslight" some are talking, 
"Nobody's daughter" out a- walking, 
Mazeppa's horse in the Bowery baulking 
And that's the way we go. 
CHORUS. 
Hands across, down the middle, 
To the music of the fiddle ; 
Surely life is but a 
riddle, 
That's the way we go. 
The excise law, it ain't at all pleasing, 
Setting all the Dutchmen sneezing, 
The policemen, they get plenty of fee- sing, 
As on blind they go. 
In politics there's something stranging, 
Andy says he's only arranging, 
Secretary Seward says he don't like changing, 
That's the way we go. 
Hands across, etc. 
ANN ELIZ.:\ JANE. 
13 
Waterfalls are elevated, 
And short skirts are celebrated, 
if you ain't in the style you're surely hated, 
That's the way we go. 
Old Ben Butler, he's a 
hero, 
Horace Greeley, he's a 
shero; 
Oh, Willie, is it you, dear, safe, safe at home, 
That's the way we go. 
Hands across, etc. 
ENCORE VERSE. 
The monkey married the baboon's sister, 
They greased the griddle with the baboon's sister, 
And oh, it raised an awful blister, 
And his name was Pat Ilalloy; 
in comes Johnny with a 
domino, 
Hit him with a 
stuffed club and stood just so, 
And they're hanging men and women here, 
For chewing slippery elm. 
Hands across, etc. 
ANN ELIZA JANE. 
As sung by HARRY ROBINSON. 
The first time I 
met my love T 
never will forget, 
For I 
was going down Broadway, the fashions to get; 
And as I 
gazed upon her, she turned her head and 
laughed, 
I 
would give five dollars then, to have her photograph. 
CHORUS. 
Then Ann Eliza Jane is sweet as sugar cane r 
I 
love you to distraction and I've got you on the brain. 
If Anna Jane would marry me, how happy we would be, 
When we had the little Janes creeping round our knee. 
14 
THE FORTUNE TELLERS. 
15 
And when they'd call me daddy, that would make us 
laugh, 
I'd take them to the picture man, and get their photo-
graph. 
Then Ann Eliza Jane, etc. 
THE FORTUNE TELLERS. 
Written and sung by Dien WEAvr.n. 
.Mn—" The Captain and his Whiskers." 
As the paper I 
was reading the other afternoon. 
I 
spied an advertisement, which took my eye quite soon; 
It was calling the attention of those who wished to know 
Of the present, past and future ; how it read I'll quickly 
show 
It commenced in great big letters, Madame Ferigo tho 
wise, 
Can correctly tell your fortune, by the stars that's in the 
skies ; 
She can tell of absent loved ones, how a fortune you 
can make, 
And she can tell you truly what trade to undertake. 
She can cure all kinds of sickness, tell lucky numbers 
too, 
And correctly she can tell you, how your sweetheart you 
should woo ; 
She can give you information, on most anything you 
wish, 
From telling how to win at cards, to peddling clams and 
fish; 
She reveals to you the secrets no mortals ever knew. 
It is perfectly astonishing to see all she can do ; 
She causes speedy marriages, with those whom we love 
best, 
And makes IT lavers' quart-.1P, along with all the rest. 
THE DASIIING POLICEMAN. 
Then it said young men and ladies, who your better 
halves would see, 
I 
can quickly send their pictures, one dollar is the fee ; 
By sending me your birth and height, and a 
small lock 
of your hair, 
I 
can tell the day you'll marry, which I 
thought was very 
fair; 
So I 
straightway wrote a 
letter, which I 
sent to Madame 
P., 
And I 
told her I 
was anxious my future wife too see ; 
And I 
told her answer quickly, not keep me in suspense ; 
Enclosed I 
sent a 
dollar bill to cover the expense. 
Then patiently I 
waited, for I 
thought she would not 
fail 
To send an answer to me, by the next return of mail ; 
But days and weeks have glided by, and still I 
look in 
vain, 
I 
will never hear of madame or my dollar bill again ; 
But I've learn't a 
lesson that will last me all my life, 
For 1 
vow I'll never try again to see my future wife ; 
And of fortune telling madames, I 
want no more to see, 
For they're all a set of. first-class beats the same as 
Madame P. 
THE DASHING POLICEMAN. 
Written and sung by Ilanny noun:sox. 
On, I'm a 
policeman, as you can plainly see, 
For as I 
walk upon the street, the boys all fear me; 
And I 
think it quite gay to be dressed up in blue, 
For every word a 
policeman says why of course it's true. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, if I 
see a 
row, I 
walk the other way, 
And in a 
grocery store I 
go, and there, you bet, I 
stay.

DARLING MINNIE LEE. 
And when on night duty, that's what I 
like to be, 
Meeting men that's going home, and some that cannot 
see ; 
If a. man does get so drunk and will stay out at night, 
And if he loses all he's got, why, don't it serve him 
right '1 
Oh, if I 
see, etc. 
DARLING MINNIE LEE. 
As sung by FRANK DUMONT. 
Where the 
olets are blooming, smiling in the gentle 
breeze, 
And the zephyrs sing sweet carols, as they flit among the 
trees, 
Where the merry songsters warble, from early morn till 
close of night, 
There we laid our darling Minnie, evermore from mortal 
sight. 
CHORUS. 
Where the merry songsters warble, from early morn till 
night, 
There we laid our darling Minnie, evermore from mortal 
sight. 
Death has robbed us of our treasure, and the angels have 
her now, 
Where no shade of pain or sorrow comes to cloud our 
darling's brow ; 
O'er her grave the birds are singing, in the sunlight 
sweet and free, 
But they cannot bring our loved one back to us, sweet 
Minnie Lee.

FAMILY RECIPES. 
A 
conic song, written by H ARRY ROBINSON. 
IN 
a 
few short rhymes I 
am going to show 
How everything you eat, 
And if you knew one-half you swallow, 
You'd throw it in the street. 
There's " mystery " I 
often eat, 
Some folks call it trash; 
I've no doubt you wonder what it is, 
But mystery, why that's hash. 
Oh, my, yes, ' tis wonderful how we live, 
Oh, my, yes, these tecipes to you I'll give. 
There's no knowing what ' tis made of, 
And how ' tis cooked that's true; 
I've often seen my landlady 
Flavor it with glue. 
To make sponge cake, she takes a 
sponge, 
Whatever size it may be, 
And sprinkles it with Squingum meal, 
Then it's red hot, don't you see. 
Oh, my, yes, etc. 
To make family soup, take an iron pot, 
Either half a 
gallon or one, 
Scour it with yellow soap, 
And set it in the sun ; 
Put in two ham bones, a 
pair of boots, 
A scrubbing brush and chalk, 
And one who eats a 
bowl of this 
Again Will never walk. 
Oh, my, yes, etc.

COBBLER'S WARE. 
For beefsteak-pie you take a 
dish 
And grease it with some fat, 
Put in a 
pair of rubber shoes, 
And the whiskers of a 
cat. 
Mix your crust with Epsom salts, 
Or else some lager beer, 
Send it to the bakery, 
And freeze it for a 
year. 
Oh, my, yes, etc. 
COBBLER'S WAKE. 
As 
sung by JOHNNY BRASSIL. 
IN 
Publin, that city of riches and .fame, 
A cobbler he died, Jerry Flynn was his name ; 
The neighbors they all grieved him, rich, poor, high and 
low, 
And to the wake of poor Jerry they rise all to go. 
SPOKEN.—
Poor Jerry, he often half-soled shoes, but he 
was a 
whole-souled man himself; he mended Con. Casey's 
shoes, put a patch on 
Mrs. McCarty's uppers, and 
charged the pair of thin) sixpence, so no wonder they all 
assembled at his wake. Mulleahy went for a 
coach for the 
ladies; lie put the fine soft straw feather bed in the bot-
tom of Con. Donohoe's wheel-barrow, and he smoothed 
down the long feathers for fear they might stick in the 
ladies and hurt their feelings as he banded in— 
CHORUS . 
Miss Casey and Miss 0.Glaney, 
Kate Nolan and the widow Delaney; 
And the elegant Judy McShaney, 
To go to the cobbler's wake. 
- 
All dressed out so grand in their best Sunday clothes, 
With Dougherty showing his jolly red nose; 
COBBLER'S WAKE. 
19 
And another boy party about twenty score, 
All met them a 
knocking at Mr. Flynn's door. 
SroKEN.—" Mrs. Flynn, why the Blazes don't you open 
the door 7 
don't you see all the qualities coming to Jerry's 
wake 3 
stick him up purpendicular in bed, put a 
clay pipe 
in his mouth and a 
night cap on him that he might look 
some way decent ; 
tidy shake some clean straw in the 
corner for the company to sit on. 
Now you're seated as 
snug as a 
bug on a rug. 
Peter Mullcalty, will you tip 
us a 
verse of a 
song'?" " Well, I 
cant sing, but I'll try to 
give you a 
verse of ' Go to the Divil, and Shake yourself.'" 
" 
Ha, ha, silence Pat Doyle, or I'll run a 
sod of turf in your 
eye ; don't you see Peter Mullcahy is going to sing— 
Oh, once I 
never thought I'd be in this dejected state, 
0 
poor fin Iorn refugee borne down by hardship's fate ; 
The birds that flutter on you tree, with terror strike my 
heart, 
Each star 1 
see alarms me, oh why did I 
desart. 
SPOKEN.—" Oh, whin a 
woroh ! 
It's too distressing to 
me nerves to sing any more; maybe Mrs. McNulty will 
tip us a 
verse." " Troth I 
will, darling," 
One evening for divarsion sake, as I 
walked out alone, 
I 
met a 
fair maid making her pitious tones, 
She wrung her hands and tore her hair, and to herself did 
Cry, 
Oh, Johnny dear don't murder me, for if you do I'll die. 
SPOKEN.—God spare you health, oh, here comes Judy 
with the punch ; now hand it round to 
Miss Casey, etc. 
The whiskey went round till they couldn't agree 
Who was of the best rank and best famil-ee ; 
For words came the blows and then fists didn't spare, 
And in handfuls they pulled out each others hair.

I'M A COLONEL IN TIIE ARMY. 
SPOKEN.—Arrah, ladies ! ain't yiz ashamed of your-
selves to act like that 7 
Blood an 'onus,. they've got the 
corpse in bethune thim; ' pon mv soul, but they're trying to 
give the poor fellow a 
black eye. 
Arrah, you ought to 
be ashamed of yourselves to try and murder a 
poor dead 
man that way ; faith he'll never get over it. 
Mrs. Flynn, 
come hither and help me get him out of the skirmish, and 
hand me the bellows and I'll blow them all out, not except-
ing— 
Miss Casey, etc. 
I'M A 
COLONEL IN THE ARMY, 
Written and sung by H ARRY ROBINSON, in his Comic Sketches. 
OH 
! 
I'm a 
Colonel young and bold, 
I'm very handsome, I've been told; 
And by the girls I'm often sold, 
Tho' a 
Colonel in the Army. 
I 
think it's gay, and so you'll say, 
It is not work, it's more like play ; 
And you take it easy all the day, 
When a 
Colonel in the Army. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! Pnta Colonel as you see, 
The girls they think a 
deal of me; 
Because with them I 
make so free, 
Tho' a 
Colonel in the Army 
When on the street the people say, 
" 
Why, there's the Colonel out to-day •" 
They want to go, yes, right away, 
To dine with me in the Army. 
I 
take them there, sometimes the mayor, 
It makes him stare, to see what's there; 
Oh! don't I 
live on the best .of fare, 
'Cause I'm a 
Colonel in the Army. 
Oh ! I'm a, etc.

THE DANDY HOOP-SIUBT MAKER. 
As sung by Dim "W EAVER. 
Now kind friends all pray lend an ear, 
And listen to my ditty; 
tell you all what did to me befall 
When I 
came to New York city. 
The first night that I 
came to town, 
I 
went to the theatre, 
And there I 
lost my heart upon 
The dandy hoop-skirt maker. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, yes, sir-ee, 
She was a 
pretty girl, 
Oh, yes, sir-ee. 
I 
sat beside her all the time, 
Until the play was ended; 
Then I 
asked her how she liked the piece. 
Says she, " I 
think it's splendid 
She kindly asked me then if I 
To her lodging place would take her; 
Says I, " I'll take you anywhere, 
My dandy hoop-skirt maker." 
Oh, yes, sir-ee, etc. 
So then she put her arm in mine, 
And off' we trudged so gayly, 
Her troubles then she told to me, 
how she was working daily; 
Says she, " my name is Sarah Jane, 
My other name is Laker, 
I 
belong to the crinoline brigade, 
I'm a 
dandy hoop-skirt maker. 
Oh, yes, sir-ee, etc. 
22 
THE DANDY HOOP-SKIRT MAKER . 
Before her lodging place we reached, 
She had all of my affections; 
I 
asked her if I 
could call again, 
She said she'd no objections ; 
Then she kiss'd her hand, and said good- night, 
As meek as any quaker, 
And up the stairs did go in haste, 
My dandy hoop-skirt maker. 
Oh, yes, sir-ee, etc. 
I 
often called to see her then, 
At last I 
popped the question ; 
She simpered, smiled, and blushing said, 
" 
Well, I've got no objection 
Rich presents then I 
made to her, 
And everywhere I'd take her, 
For nothing was too good you know, 
For my dandy hoop- skirt maker. 
Oh, yes, sir-ee, etc. 
I 
gave her money then to buy 
An outfit for the wedding, 
And a 
house I 
furnished nice and neat, 
With furniture and bedding ; 
And the minister was then engaged, 
Who said my wife he'd make her, 
And the wedding day was settled too, 
By my dandy hoop- skirt maker. 
Oh, yes, sir-ee, etc. 
But just before the day came round, 
She falsely did deceive me ; 
She broke her vow and broke my heart, 
The day that she did leave me ; 
For all my furniture she sold, 
Then run off with a 
baker ; 
And that's the last I 
ever seen 
Of my dandy hoop-skirt maker. 
Oh, yes, sir-ee, etc. 
THE JOURNEYMAN BARBER. 
23 
THE JOURNEYMAN BARBER WITH NICE CtlitLY HAIR. 
A comic ditty, composed by D ICK W EAVER. 
THE subject I've got now I 
think it will please you, 
l'm going to sing of a 
flashy young gent, 
Who once lived in this city, but now he has left it 
To go to a 
place where he don't pay any rent. 
Now this flashy young gent always wore a 
gold watch, 
sir; 
And a 
nice diamond ring, and a 
pin, I 
declare, 
Tho' his wages were small, for by trade he was only 
A journeyman barber with nice curly hair. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, he was admired wherever he went, 
With him all the gills fell in love, I 
declare; 
But to marry he didn't at all feel inclined, sir, 
Did this journeyman barber with nice curly hair. 
This journeyman barber played Keno and Faro, 
And visited all the flash places in town; 
Of cash he had plenty, and freely he'd spend it, 
lie was voted by all the best fellow around. 
On the corner he'd stand when the day it was fine, sir; 
As the girls would pass by, then at them he would 
stare, 
For he was a 
killer among the young ladies, 
Was this journeyman barber with nice curly hair. 
Oh, he was admired, etc. 
Now, this journeyman barber he owned a 
light wagon, 
And a 
mare that could go at a 
two- forty pace; 
At the race- course you'd always be sure to find him 
Whenever there happened to be any race. 
He'd then bet his money on this horse at that, sir, 
But he'd lay all he had on his favorite mare. 
24 
THE CHARMING LAGER BEER . 
Oh, he was a 
sport that few could get over, 
Was this journeyman barber with nice curly hair. 
Oh, he was admired, etc. 
This journeyman barber at last he got tired 
Of cutting men's hair and shaving their chins; 
He concluded to leave, for the trade did not suit him, 
And six dollars a 
week would not keep him in pins; 
So he then left his place, but he still was a 
sport, sir, 
For of money he yet always had a 
good share; 
And his nice horse and wagon be yet would ride out in, 
Would this journeyman barber with nice curly hair. 
Oh, he was admired. etc. 
This journeyman barber to all was a 
puzzler, 
For no one could tell how his money he made, 
Till one day he was nabbed dead to rights shoving queer, 
When all his bright hopes for the future did fade. 
He begged for release, but the Judge couldn't see it, 
So to Sing Sing he went for a 
little fresh air; 
And now he is there breaking stones in the quarry, 
Is this journeyman barber with nice curly hair. 
Oh, he was admired, etc.

Sketches. 
THE words I'm about to sing to you, 
Is some, that's very clear, 
And all of you will quickly say, 
Sometimes it gives you cheer; 
For brandy, wine and whiskey too, 
They all are very dear, 
There's nothing like a 
five-cent glass 
Of sparkling lager beer.

OH, YOU MUST LET ME DRIVE . 
25 
CHORUS. 
Whiskey's bad and gin, 
And that I 
safely say, 
Each of them I 
dread and fear; 
There's nothing like a 
charming drink, 
Of sparkling lager beer. 
And as we stand with glass in band, 
You'll see each of us smile; 
And don't a 
glass of it" go good" 
After a 
long, long day of toil I 
So when you meet me in the street, 
Remember I'm sincere ; 
We'll go and take a 
sparkling drink 
Of delicious lager beer. 
Whiskey's bad, etc. 
OH, YOU MUST LET MEE DRIVE. 
Written by HARRY ROBINSON, and sung by him at his Comical 
Sketches. 
IT'S gay to live at home and drive out all the day, 
And go just where you please, no one dare say nay 
Papa has got a 
horse, and it is to be mine, 
Comic 
And I'll drive him every day till he makes the fastest 
time. 
SPOKEN.—Indeed, if anyone can train a 
horse, I'm sure 
I 
can—papa and I 
drove out the other day and we went 
through Central Park. 
Oh, wasn't the park crowded ; 
there was Adolphus Simpkins with his bran new butter-
fly and eye glasses ; oh, how he did stare at me, and just 
then papa said, " Matilda, let me take these reins." 
But 
I 
said, " papa-

" 
Oh, you must let me drive, 
Oh, you must let me drive, 
The only favor I 
ask of you 
It is to let me drive." 
Oh, I 
am full of fun, as young girls in their teens, 
I 
go it while I'm young and live beyond my means ; 
Oh, how I'd like a 
beau, if a 
good one I 
could find, 
And how I'd love him too, if he would treat me kind. 
SPOKEN.—I 
won't have one that does not keep a 
horse 
and carriage. 
Adolphus Simpkins has a 
horse, he says 
he goes in 2.40; I 
think he means two hours and forty 
minutes, but I'm too fast for that slow time. 
Yes, ' Dol-
phus, dear, I 
will have you, but oh— 
You must let, etc. 
MY NANCY GREY. 
Song and Dance, as sung by JOHNNY Brussm. 
I 
FELL in love with Nancy Grey 
The first time that I 
met her, 
She looked so loving at me 
That I 
never can forget her; 
I 
said I'd try to win her love, 
Not minding the expense. 
I 
treated her to ginger snaps 
Till it cost me fifty cents. 
CHORUS . 
Alas, oh dear, she stole my heart away, 
Then left me here alone to die, deceitful Nancy Grey. 
I 
met her going down the street 
an-Ther moke 
VALICINO DOWN BROADWAY . 
27 
And turned and hastened up behind 
And overheard their talking. 
He told her that he loved her, 
And she said she loved him. 
I 
felt as if I 
had sat down 
On a 
cushion full of pins. 
Alas, oh dear, etc. 
I 
must have satisfaction, 
So 
have to fight a 
duel; 
I'll send a 
challenge to this moke 
That cut me out so cruel ; 
I'll kill him dead as chowder, then, 
Without a 
word of pity ; 
I'll leave this sad country 
And go to—Jersey City. 
Alas, oh dear, etc.

In golden dreams you hover near, 
Yes, I'm wishing love for thee. 
CHORUS. 
Wishing, longing, unhappy as can be, 
Waiting, watching still for thee. 
We are parted—gentle zephyrs, 
Bear the tale across the sea;

To a 
fond heart, back to me. 
I 
am watching by the road-side, 
Where I 
hope your form to see; 
CAPTAIN JENKS.

Coming with a 
loving kiss, 
Darling, I'm wishing love for thee.

CAPTAIN JENKS OF THE HORSE-MARINES. 
As sung by Luret.4.nD in his Soirees. 
I 
AM Captain Jenks of the Horse- Marines, 
I 
often live beyond my means. 
I 
sport young ladies in their teens, 
To cut a 
swell in the army. 
I 
teach the ladies how to dance, how to dance, how to 
dance. 
I 
teach the ladies how to dance, for I'm their pet in the 
army. 
CHORTJS. 
I'm captain Jenks of the Horse-Marines, 
I 
give my horse good corn and beans; 
Of course it is beyond my means, 
Although a 
captain in the army. 
I 
joined my corps when twenty-one, 
Of course I 
thought it capital fun, 
When the enemy came then off I 
run, 
I 
wasn't cut out for the army. 
When I 
left home, mamma she cried, mamma she cried, 
When I 
left home, mamma she cried, " he ain't cut out 
for the army." 
SPOKEN.—But my dear mamma, you know, perhaps 
you don't know 
I'm Captain Jenks, etc. - 
The first day I 
went out to drill, 
The bugle sound made me quite ill; 
At the balance step my hat it fell, 
That wouldn't do for the army. 
30 
SHE IS DEAR TO ME. 
The officers they all did shout, they all cried out, 
They did shout, the officers all did shout, oh, that's the 
curse of the army. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, but they didn't Shout long, for I 
turned 
to them and said, don't you know— 
I'm Captain Jenks, etc. 
My tailor's bills came in so fast, 
Forced me one day to leave at last; 
And ladies too no more did cast 
Sheep's eyes at me in the army. 
My creditors at me did shout, at me did shout, 
At me did shout, my creditors at me did shout, why kick 
him out of the army. 
SPOKEN.—Kick me out of the army! Well, gentlemen, 
that's a 
good joke, not kick me out, but I'll resign for— 
I'm Captain Jenks, etc. 
SHE IS DEAR TO ME. 
Words and Music by FRANK DUMONT. 
MEMORY now calls back to mind, when I 
a wayward 
boy, 
Gazed fondly on a 
loving form, my pride, my only joy; 
How side by side each hour passed, our hearts were 
light and free ; 
In yonder churchyard now she lies, yet she is dear to me. 
CHORUS. 
And by her side in death I'll lie 
Together then we'll be; 
I 
long to go and join her there, 
For she is dear to me. 
aow bitter fell the scalding tears, when I 
found she was 
no more, 
But her spirit seems to hover near, to call me beyond 
the shore; 
THE OYSTER TAMER. 
31 
The grief has broke my sorrowed heart, which always 
turned to thee, 
I 
long to go and join her there, for she is dear to me. 
And by her side, etc. 
THE OYSTER TAMER. 
As sung by HARRY ROBINSON. 
WHITE folks give me your attention, while I 
sing you a 
ditt-i-e; 
It's all about a 
nice young man, what lived in this ere 
city; 
He was a 
carpenter by trade, and always acted on the 
square, 
lie found his way to Washington, and gouged himself in 
a 
chair right there. 
CHORUS. 
So fare you well, my old Mary Ann, 
Pm going to leave you, my honey; 
I'm going down to Washington, 
To circulate the money. 
His father was an oyster tamer, of Saddle Rock Oysterie, 
He used to catch them in the Sound, and sell then in the 
Bowerie; 
His mother was an invalid, and they thought she was go-
ing to die; 
his brother Bill got mad one day, and run a 
knot hole in 
his eye. 
So fare you. well, etc. 
His sister, Sal, got marr-i-ed, they gave a 
fancy ball and 
a 
sup ; 
There was cream of tartar and tarty tarts. and chestnut 
burrs in a 
cup; 
32 
ON THE BEACH AT LONG BRANCH. 
There was E. Flat bugle jelly soup, and butter strong 
enough to talk; 
They bought it off an emigrant ship, that came over there 
by the way of Cork. 
So fare you well, etc. 
ON THE BEACH AT LONG BRANCH. 
As sung by the GREAT LINGARD and HARRY ROBINSON. 
ON 
the beach at Long Branch, one fine summer's day, 
I 
had a 
novel reading to pass the time away, 
And so interested was I 
in the plot, 
A 
gent stood there, beside me, still I 
saw him not; 
Till at last, by chance, my eye-lids I 
did raise, 
I 
found him on me looking with enraptured gaze; 
Bright blue eyes so sparkling, handsome Grecian nose, 
Teeth of pearly whiteness, quite the pink of beaux. 
CHORUS. 
'Twas on the beach at Long Branch, one fine summer's 
day, 
I 
met this handsome man who stole my heart away; 
Now I 
feel so happy as the blissful moments glide, 
The day is quickly coming when I 
shall be his bride! 
As like one awaking from some happy dream, 
We glances did exchange; his eyes with love did beam ; 
Ere much time was over, we began to chat, 
And hours passed away, still he beside me_sat ; 
And with his ways so winning he did love impart, 
My spirits rose as high as the early morning lark. 
lie told me that he loved me, vowed that all his life 
Would be to him worthless unless I'd be his wife. 
'Twas on the beach, etc. 
He said that if I'd marry, all troubles we would drown, 
And live in blissful ignorance of all the cares of town. 
THE BIRDS WILL COME AGAIN. 
33 
With soft persuasive power he told me of his love, 
Vowing to be true by all the powers above! 
He asked me if I'd marry, pressed me then to say, 
Till to his wishes yielding, I 
named the happy day. 
He said his cup of bliss was filled quite to the brim, 
he'd live alone for me, and I 
alone tor him ! 
SPOKEN.—And I 
can assure you, ladies and gentlemen, 
he is one of those dear, delightful fellows that no girl 
could resist, and I'm happy and proud to say, up to the 
present moment, I've DO cause to regret that— 
'Twas on the beach, etc. 
THE BIRDS WILL COME AGAIN. 
Words by GEO. COOPER, Music by J. R. THOMAS, and sung by 
CHAS. HENRY. 
DEAD leaves were falling, lone birds were calling, 
Thro' sighing valley, a 
gentle, sad farewell ; 
Somebody straying long was delaying, 
Fond lips were meeting, but whose I'll never tell ; 
" 
Good-bye, my own love, for you alone, love, 
My soul is pining.
- 
in sunlight and in rain, 
Though we are parted, don't be sad hearted, 
Winter will pass, love, and the birds will come again, 
Winter will pass, love, and the birds will come again." 
Sunlight and shadow fell on the meadow, 
Dewdrops were gleaming, the skies were bringing May, 
Soft winds were playing, somebody straying, 
Seein'd very careless of beauties on the way: 
Once more my darling, robin and starling, 
Sing down the valley, forgetting all their pain, 
Now by your side, love, now will I 
bide, love, 
Sigh not, for birds, love, will always come again, 
Sigh not, for birds, love, will always come again.

THE INSTRUMENTAL ACT. 
lizth INSTRUMENTAL ACT. 
Written and performed by HARRY ROBINSON, throughout the 
States, with immense stueess. 
Now I've some instruments I 
will play, 
If you will list to what I 
say ; 
And to please you and have some fun, 
For my name is Harry Robinson. 
I've a 
penny trumpet in my clothes, 
But where it is, Lord only knows ; 
Oh, here it is, plain to be seen, 
I'll play you the " Wearing of the Green." 
(plays:) 
CHORUS. 
Thus it is day after day, 
All sorts of instruments I 
play ; 
Always lively and full of fun, 
For my name is Harry Robinson. 
This little trumpet I 
have got, 
I 
bought one day in a 
toy shop, 
Five dollars for it I 
had to pay, 
So the " Last Rose of Summer " I 
will play. 
(Plays ) 
Thus it is, etc. 
'Here's an old pair of bellows, as you all know, 
And I'm the boy can make them blow ; 
I 
run the scale up to the moon, 
Now list and I 
will play you a 
tune. 
(Plays.) 
Thus it is, etc. 
This little mousetrap I 
found one day, 
And on it a 
tune I 
will play 
35 
OH, WOULD I 
wi.RE A FISH. 
Just listen while I 
make it hum, 
We'll have the imitation of a 
drum. 
Thus it is, etc. 
But here's the best of all the lot, • 
A 
fiddle such as'all have got; 
You've seen one like it all your days, 
But I 
can play it all sorts of ways. 
Thus it is, etc. 
Oh, here's the very thing after all, 
To imitate a 
baby's squall ; 
Just look out sharp now, mind your eye, 
And hear ir 
make the baby cry. 
Thus it is, etc. 
But after all, since I 
was born 
No instrument suits me like a 
horn ; 
I 
play on one but imitate two, 
Now list while I 
do it now for you 
Thus it is, etc. 
OH, WOULD I 
WERE A FISH. 
As sung by HARRY ROBINSON. 
On, would I 
were a 
fish, how happy I 
would be, 
If I 
could live upon the land as well as in the sea ; 
in a 
bird-cage I'd be useful like a 
preacher in a 
church, 
For when the bird would ' light on me, why I 
would be a 
perch, 
CHORITS. 
Oh, would I 
were a 
fish, 
how happy I 
would be, 
If I 
could live upon land. 
As well as in the sea.

QUEEN OF THE NIGHT. 
Oh, would I 
were a 
fish, I'd like to be a 
whale, 
Oh, then I'd be useful ; yes from head to tail; 
If some poor honest man, that had to work and toil, 
Would bore a hole right in my back, why, then he 
would " strike oil." 
Oh, would I 
were, etc. 
Oh, if I 
was a 
fish wouldn't that be sweet, 
Stuck into a 
bouquet, thrown at some lady's feet; 
And then she'd pick me up, if so inclined she felt, 
And when the lady smelt me. why, then I 
would be a 
smelt. 
Oh, would I 
were, etc. 
QUEEN OF THE NIGHT. 
Music by J. R. 
THOMAS. 
Serenade, sung by FRANK CAMPBELL. 
QUEEN of the night, hours of delight, 
Wake for us darling, oh ! linger not long, 
Voices of day, die far away, 
Zephyrs no more sing their murmuring song. 
Wake from thy dreams, fair silver beams, 
Weave thee a 
throne that is beautiful and bright, 
Lonely I 
wait down by the gate, 
-Come in thy splendor thou queen of the night; 
Lonely I 
wait down by the gate, 
Come in thy splendor thou queen of the night, 
Queen, queen, queen of the night. 
Parted from thee life's weary sea 
Bears me along in my sorrow and gloom 
Sunny rays fade, night's deep'ning shade 
Finds me. once more near blest islands of bloom. 
Fast fly the hours, rose clustered bowers 
Wait for thy coming, in dew gleaming light; 
THAT'S THE TROUBLE WITH ME NOW. 
-
37 
Dawn on my heart, never to part, 
Come in thy splendor thou queen of the night; 
Dawn on my heart, never to part. 
Come in thy splendor thou queen of the night, 
Queen, queen, queen of the night. 
THAT'S THE TROUBLE WITH ME NOW. 
Song and Dance, written and sung by JOHNNY BnAssm. 
I 
AM the unhappiest moke that e'er came from ole Vir-
ginny ; 
There I 
used for massa dig and hoe, 
But when Secesh was routed, and his things was confis-
cated, 
And then I 
didn't know whar the debbil to go. 
I 
aint got no clothes and my feet is almost froze, 
Cold winter you know has come on, 
But I 
never died yet, so 1'11 get up and git, 
I'll sing and dance to keep myself warm, 
For I 
tell you that's the trouble with me now; 
Before the rebellion broke out I 
had always peace and 
plenty, 
I 
had nothing to trouble my poor head ; 
But now I 
feel so old and my age is only twenty, 
Lord, I 
often I 
have wished I 
was dead; 
But it's 110 use to grieve. I'd just as soon live, 
And that you can see at a 
glance ; 
So keep your eyes on me and I'll soon let you see, 
how this unhappy moke can sing and dance, 
For that's the trouble with me now. 
I 
love a 
little yellow girl way down in ole Virginny, 
And I 
love her as I 
love my life ; 
She squints with both eyes, and she's got a 
picanniny, 
Some day I 
hope to make that gal my wife;

THE PAIR WITH THE LONG ARMS. 
STATION D. 
39 
Long the war is over and we ought to live in clover, 
The thought of it makes my heart feel bigger ; 
Away with emancipation, I'd rather be on the old plan-
tation; 
It's the best place in the world for de nigger, 
And that's the trouble with me now. 
THE PAIR WITH IRE LONG ARMS. 
A 
comic Song and Dance by H ARRY ROBINSON. 
On here we are both so happy and free, 
To make you all laugh and so jolly be; 
My sister and me are so lively and calm, 
We both dress alike and we've got a 
long arm. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my, don't we look jolly, 
Oh, my, don't we look calm, 
Oh, my, aint we both lively, 
Oh, my, what a 
long arm. 
If there is any man that does want a 
wife, 
I'll make him happy all the days of his life; 
When I 
get married. I 
must have my own way, 
I'm a 
good one to talk, for I 
talk all the day. 
Oh, my, etc. 
I'll be an old maid so happy and free, 
Not a man in this world can captivate me ; 
To marry a 
man I 
would feel afraid, 
So I'll just, live single and die an old maid. 
Oh, my, etc. 
If a 
man marries me I 
will be his best friend, 
I'll do all his washing and all his clothes mend; 
He must be good and his temper real calm, . 
If not, he'll feel the weight of my long arm. 
Oh, my, etc. 
STATION D. 
Comic Song, sung by HARRY ROBINsoN. 
THERE'S every sort of station—station high and station 
low, 
And it would puzzle calculation, if I'd mention all I 
know; 
But I'll tell you of the queerest, in the papers oft you'll 
see 
" 
There's a letter for you, dearest, please call at Sta-
tion D." 
CHORUS. 
It really is peculiar, 
And in this you'll all agree; 
Every girl from Jane to Julia 
Has heard of Station D. 
'Twas an afternoon in summer, as I 
strolled upon Broad-
way, 
Oh, I 
glanced at every corner, for my love was out that 
day; 
Very soon of course I 
met her, but.she gayly said to me, 
" 
Harry, go and you'll find a 
letter, don't forget, at Sta-

Ladies when they cross the ferry look so charming and 
so sweet, 
Oft they see a 
chap quite merry on the boat or on the 
street; 
40 
I'M HAPPY BY YOUR SIDE. 
Don't they take morning papers, that their pretty eyes 
may see, 
" 
Jockey hat and arm so taper, there's a 
letter at Sta-
tion D." 
It really is, etc. 
That's where broken hearts are mended, if walls could 
only speak, 
Here you meet your dear intended any day in the'week ; 
If you lose your dog, poor noodle, while out upon a 
spree, 
Recollect that many a poodle may be found thro' sta-
tion D. 
It really is, etc. 
Now I'll end my little ditty, all about this funny place, 
Every love match in the city, I'm sure that here you'll 
trace; 
So believe me at your opinion, for it makes no odds to 
me, 
Even " babies for adoption," may be had at Station D. 
It really is, etc. 
I'M HAPPY BY YOUR SIDE. 
Words and Music by FRANK DUMONT. 
I'm happy by your side, love, when your gentle form is 
hi g 
it, 
Your blue eye fondly beaming, like stars beyond the sky; 
0, I 
must leave you, loved one, to roam across the sea, 
If I 
am spared I'll hasten back, my own sweet love, to 
thee. 
CHORUS. 
Years roll by, and hand in hand, 
On life's sea we glide ; 
Afar or near, no joy is known, 
Until I'm by your side. 
I'LL THROW MYSELF AWAY. 
41 
I'm happy by your side, love, no more from thee I'll roam, 
But by your side forevermore with thee remain at home ;

kiss me good night, loved one, the stars in heaven pale, 
They shine sweet on you and me, as in life's bark we sail. 
Years roll by, etc.. 
I'LL THROW MYSELF AWAY. 
Original Song and Dance, by JOEINIsTY Bna,ssm. 
On, give me your attention, 
l've got a 
song that's new ; 
I 
guess I 
just will mention it, 
I 
intended it for you ; 
But when I 
see those ruby lips 
And bright eyes turned this way, 
High golly, I 
just feel so good 
I 
could throw myself away. 
CLIOEUS. 
Oh, yes, I 
love the white folks so, 
I'll serve them night and day; 
And if I 
can but please you, 
I'll throw myself away. 
I've seen the gals in the South, 
Likewise the East and West, 
And all throughout this happy land, 
With such bright angels blest ; 
But when I 
saw the Broadway gals, 
They dressed so neat and gay, 
I 
think if one will marry me, 
I'll throw myself away. 
Oh, yes, I 
love, etc. 
Oh, gentlemen, I've a 
word for you, 
You bucks, of course I 
mean,

MEET ME AT TWILIGHT TO-MORROW. 
I 
think you are the luckiest chaps 
That ever I 
have seen, 
With such bright charmers by your side 
To steal your heart away ; 
I 
think if I 
was one of you 
I'd throw myself away. 
Oh, yes, I 
love, etc.

Words by GEORGE COOPER. 
Music by J. B. 
D ONNIRER. 
M EET me, my dearest, at twilight to- morrow, 
Down where the river in melody flows ; 
While we are parted, oh, sad is my sorrow, 
Bring to my bosom love's sweetest repose; 
Come, I 
am weary from sighing, 
Why should I 
ever be severed from thee; 
Come, for the roses are dying, 
Rose of my heart, come again unto me. 
Client]. S. 
Meet me, my love, meet me, my love 
Meet me at twilight to- morrow. 
Meet me, my dearest, at twilight to-morrow, 
Weary's the time till I 
see thee again ; 
Darling, Pd perish to shield thee from sorrow, 
Die but to save thee one moment's pain ; 
Come, for the leaves they are waiting, 
Sweet are the words I 
would whisper to thee 
Come, for the birds they are mating, 
Star of my heart, come again unto me. 
Meet me, etc.

PULLING HARD AGAINST THE STREAM. 
W ords by CLIFTON, sung by H ARRY RODINSON. 
IN 
the world I've gained my knowledge, 
And for it I've had to pay, 
Though I 
never went to college, 
Yet I've heard that poets say 
" 
Life is like a 
mighty river, 
Rolling on from day to day, 
Men are vessels launched upon it, 
Sometimes wrecked and cast away." 
CHORUS . 
So then do your best for one another, 
Making life a 
pleasant dream; 
Help a 
worn and weary brother, 
Pulling bard against the stream. 
Many a 
bright and good-hearted fellow, 
Many a 
noble-minded man, 
Finds himself in water shallow, 
Then assist him if you can. 
Some succeed at every turning, 
Fortune favors every scheme, 
Others, too, though more deserving, 
Have to pull against the stream. 
So then, etc. 
If the wind is in your favor, 
And you've weathered every squall, 
Think of those whose luckless labor 
Never gets fair winds at all ; 
Working hard, contented, willing, 
Struggling thro' life's ocean wide, 
Not a 
friend; and not a 
shilling, 
Pulling hard against the stream. 
So then, et.

BEAR IT LIKE A MAN. 
Don't give way to foolish sorrow', 
Let this keep you in good cheer ; 
Brighter days may conic to-morrow, 
If you try and persevere. 
Darkest nights must have a 
morning, 
Tho' the sky be overcast, 
Longest lanes must have a 
turning, 
And the tide will turn at last. • 
So then, etc. 
BEAR IT LIKE A MAN. 
Sung by CHARLES vivimi. 
I 
GAYLY sing from day to day, 
A 
careless man am I, 
As long as I 
can pay my way, 
Misfortune I 
defy. 
And then with spirit ever gay, 
I 
do the best I 
can, 
When troubles dome upon my way, 
To bear it like a 
man. 
ClIORITS. 
I 
gayly sing from day to day, 
And do the best I 
can, 
When troubles come upon my way 
To bear it like a 
man. 
We're told that since the world began, 
That's many years ago, 
If money did not make the man, 
It made the " mare to go ; " 
Of comforts, I 
have quite enough, 
Although my wealth is small, 
I 
know that I 
am better off 
Than folks with none at all. 
MY SOUL IS DARK .. 
45 
If fortune on a 
friend doth shine, 
I 
love him none the less, 
I 
never grieve, I 
never pine, 
For wealth I 
don't possess; 
A happy home, a 
loving wife, 
Of worldly goods a 
store, 
Contented with my lot in life, 
A king can be no more. 
I 
gayly sing, etc. 
And one thing too I 
hold it good, 
Wherever I 
may be, 
To do to others as I 
would 
That they should do to me; 
This world would ne'er be dark and drear, 
If each would try the plan, 
Of giving when they had to spare, 
To help their fellow-man. 
I 
gayly sing, etc. 
KY SOUL IS DARK. 
Words by Lord BYRON. 
M Y 
800 is dark, oh, quickly string 
Tile harp I 
yet can brook to hear, 
Let thy gentle fingers fling 
Its melting murmurs o'er mine ear; 
If in this heart a 
hope be dear, 
That sound shall charm it forth again; 
If in these eyes there lurk a 
tear, 
'Twill flow and cease to burn my brain-,— 
'Twill flow and cease to burn my brain. 
But bid the strains be wild and deep, 
Nor let thy notes of joy be first; 
46 
THE FLOWERS ARE ON THY GRAVE. 
I 
tell thee, minstrel, I 
must weep, 
Or else this heavy`heart will burst; 
For it bath been by sorrow nurst, 
And ached in sleepless sorrow long, 
And now ' tis doomed to know the worst 
And break at once or yield to song— 
And break at once or yield to song. 
THE FLOWERS ARE ON THY GRAVE. 
Words by Smut, Music arranged by FRANK DUMONT. 
Tam flowers are on thy grave, Mary, 
Where thou in youth were laid; 
A 
pleasant and a 
sweet perfume 
They lend the quiet shade; 
And there the pensive birds, Mary, 
Are warbling all day long, 
With mournfulness in every tone, 
And grief in every song. 
Thy plaYmates think of thee, Mary, 
Within thy early grave; 
Though far away and scattered wide, 
Upon the land and wave; 
They heave for thee a 
sigh, Mary, 
And breathe for thee a 
prayer, 
And think they see thy smiling face, 
And bless thee everywhere. 
The mourners now are few, Mary, 
And fewer soon will be ; 
Till not a 
tear shall flow or fall, 
From sorrow's eyes for thee ; 
But when they shall lie down, Mary, 
Like thee in endless sleep, 
I AIN'T A GOING TO TELL. 
Oh may they leave a 
fame behind 
As dear as thine to keep. 
The months are many now, Mary, 
Since thou were softly laid, 
All in thy youth and loveliness, 
Within the grave- yard's shade • 
And light they press the sod, Mary, 
Who tread where thou dost sleep, 
And musing on life's beauty gone, 
Look sadly down and weep. 
I .AINT A 
GOING TO TELL. 
New Version, sung by JOHNNY BRASSIL. 
W HERE'ER I 
go my heart is light, 
I 
can't tell the reason why; 
I 
al way think of the darling girl, 
With her " dark and rolling eye." 
She is dear to me as life itself, 
And she knows that full well; 
But who she is and where she lives, 
I 
ain't a 
going to tell. 
cnoxuS. 
She is sweeter than the sweetest, 
And neater than the neatest; 
You talk about your fashions 
But she's sure to cut a 
swell, 
But who she is—and where she lives, 
I 
ain't a 
going to tell. 
The other day I 
walked around, 
To see my love at home; 
The old folks both were out, 
And we were left alone.

THE BAICY SHOW. 
I 
thought I 
would the question pop, 
For it suited me quite well; 
But, judge of my surprise when she said— 
I 
ain't a 
going to tell. 
She is, etc. 
She promised 'ere the month went round, 
That she would be my bride; 
I 
was so happy and content, 
That I 
scarcely left her side. 
At all the hops my wife and I, 
Are sure to cut a 
swell; 
Our little family numbers but— 
I 
ain't a ' going to tell. 
She is, etc. 
THE BABY SHOW. 
Comic Song, sung by BILLY Moneis. 
I'm a 
darkey from the country, oh, 
Come down to see the baby show; 
At Barnum's Museum I 
did see 
Babies 011 their mammy's knee ; 
The fattest babe I 
ever saw, 
Was one that came from Arkensaw; 
He was fat and black as a 
Thomas cat, 
Crying for his daddy, oh • 
CHORUS . 
Clap your hands till daddy comes holm*, 
Clap your hands till daddy comes home;

It's the truth I 
tell you, oh; 
AS THROUGH THE riitic I GO .

He fought the wars of Mexico, 
To buy the baby a 
jumper, oh; 
Then she placed it on her knee, 
Weighed it by the rule of three; 
Gave it some paragoric, oh, 
And sent it up to glory, oh! 
Clap your hands, etc.

My age is twenty-one,

But very fond of fun ; 
And though to vice I'm not inclined,

And always like to speak my Mind, 
Alike to every one. 
CHORUS. 
For as through the Park I

The gents all want to know, 
Who is that darling girl that drives so fast, 
They'd like to know. 
I

And do just as I 
will, 
While lovers come from near and far, 
And me with nonsense fill ;

But then they say I'm only in fan,

Death came and stole her from my heart where she was

She kissed me, then into my arms she laid in silent death. 
A

lies, 
Mary, darling, now looks down from beyond the azure 
skies ;

The first case before the court is what, sir 7 
Bones. A pickpocket—a

very lowz in the fingers, often makes a 
mistake by put-

Judge. Well, my dear fellow, what is the charge

I

To keep her in prison all night ; 
To keep her locked up without a

A 
Beautiful Ballad. 
Music by W HITTEMORE, sung by FRANK DUMONT. 
[These beautiful lines were found pencilled on the wall by a 
con-
vict in the Penitentiary, Kingston, C. W.] 
F ITE wandered far away, mother, far from my happy 
home, 
And left the land that crave me birth in other climes to 
roam; 
And time since then has rolled his years, and marked 
them on my brow, 
Yet still I 
think of thee, mother, still I 
think of thee,. 
Yet still I 
think of thee, mother, I'm thinking of thee 
now. 
CHORUS. 
Roll back again those bygone years, when I, a 
wayward 
boy, 
'Was shielded in my mother's arms, her pride, her only 
joy ; 
Waft swiftly on ye winged winds, that fan my fevered 
brow, 
And tell her that her absent child is thinking of her now. 
When kneeling by thy side, mother, you watched my 
dawning youth, 
And taught my boyish lips to read the sacred words of 
truth ; 
But they are all forgotten now, and broken every vow, 
THE DONKEY CART. 
53 
Yet still I 
think of thee, mother, still I 
think of thee, 
Yet still I 
think of thee, mother, I'm thinking of thee 
now. 
Roll back again, etc. 
I'm lonely and forsaken, mother, no friend is near me 
now, 
To soothe me with a 
tender word or cool my burning 
• 
brow; 
The dearest ties affection wove, are all torn from me 
noW,

Yet still I 
think of thee, mother, still I

THE DONKEY CART. 
As sung by JOHNNY BRASIL. 
IN 
a 
pleasant valley, near the foot of Saffron Hill, 
Where the odor of Fleet ditch did my nose with perfume 
fill; 
'Twas there I 
met by accident, oh, but the other (lay, 
A 
lovely little creature whose name was Lucy Gray. 
CHORUS. 
But Lucy Gray she ran away, 
She nearly broke my heart; 
She left me for a 
cove that drives 
An ugly donkey cart. 
She kept a 
large emporium of potatoes and fried fish, 
And every day I'd go there and partake of that same 
dish ; 
While she the fish was frying she stole my heart away, 
And I 
was head in heels in love with charming Lucy 
Gray. 
But Lucy Gray, etc. 
56 
CROWNED WITH THE TEMPEST. 
I 
went down on my marrow bones one day in Lucy's 
shop, 
My heart was nearly bursting the question for to pop; 
Says I, " dear Lucy, I 
want a 
wife," says she, " is that 
the case" 
She took a 
bowl of butter and slapped it in my face. 
But Lucy Gray etc. 
On Sunday they went to • church, on Monday cut their 
sticks, 
I 
never thought that she would serve me such a 
trick; 
But this is a 
cutting story, so I 
must cut away, 
And try to find a 
girl more kind than sassy Lucy Gray. 
But Lucy Gray, etc. 
CROWNED WITH ai TEMPEST. 
Solo and Chorus—from Eawarn, arranged for this work by 
FRANK DUMONT. 
Crowned with the tempest, robed in the forest, 
Monarch of mountains, thro' air thou soarest, 
Piercing the azure and kissed by the sunbeams, 
Storms are thy pleasure, proud mount of clouds ; 
Piercing the azure, kissed by the sunbeams, 
Storms are thy pleasure, proud mount of clouds, 
Proud mount of clouds. 
CHORUS. 
We joy in thy thunders and storm-bringing clouds, 
Grandly thou rearest thyself to heaven; 
Storm- clouds thou wearest—firmly thou standest, 
Thou bearest enthroned on thy brow. 
'Tis joy to list to the tramp of the night winds, 
Loud where it peals for the march of the storm, 
THE UMBRELLA COURTSHIP . 
57 
The storm that sweeps thy hoary form ; 
Loud when it peals for the march of the storm, 
The storm that sweeps thy hoary form ; 
Wild sweeps the storm—o'er thy hoary form, 
O'er thy hoary form. 
We joy in thy thunders, etc. 
THE UMBRELLA COURTSHIP. 
A Comical Song. 
As sung by H ARRY ROBINSON. 
A 
BELLE and beau did walking go, 
In love they both were pining ; 
The winds in gentle gales did blow, 
And April sun was shining. 
Tho' Simon long bad courted miss, 
lie knew he'd acted wrong in 
Not having dared to steal a 
kiss, 
Which set him quite a-longing. 
It so occurred as they did walk, 
And viewed each dale so flowery ; 
As Simon by her side did stalk, 
Declared the sky looked showery. 
The rain to her came like a 
drug, 
When loudly he did bellow, 
" 
Look here, my love, we can he snug, 
For I've brought my umbrella." 
Swift flew the shelter over miss, 
Now Simon was a 
droll one; 
lie thought this was the time to kiss, 
So from her lips he stole one. 
She blushed, the rain left off and he, 
The umbrella closed for drainino. ; 
" 
Oh, don't," says she, " I 
plainly see 
it hasn't left off raining." 
STAY, 
MY LOVE, 
STAY. 
Simon when he found the plan, 
The umbrella righted ; 
He grew quite bold, talked like a 
man, 
And she seemed quite delighted. 
Their lips ran chimes full fifty times, 
Like simple lovers training ; 
Says she, " these are but lover's crimes, 
I 
hope it won't leave off raining." 
lie kissed her out of her consent 
That she'd become his bride, hence, 
To buy the ring was his intnet, 
And then to get the license ; 
At parting then he took much pains, 
To ask when next he d 
meet her, 
Says she, " I 
meet when next it rains, 
So bring your umbrella ! " 
The wedding morn, no time to waste, 
lie rose before it was yet day, 
And just as if to please her taste, 
It was a 
shocking wet day. 
They married and had children dear, 
Eight round-faced little fellows, 
But strange to state, the whole of the eight 
Were marked with umbrellas. 
STAY, MY LOVE, STAY! 
As sung by HARRY ROBINSON. 
THE Eastern waves are red with the coming of the sun, 
And from the sky the timid stars are fading one by one; 
I 
grieve to see them go, for we dare not meet by day, 
It cannot yet be time to part, oh, stay, my own love, stay, 
Stay, stay, oh, stay, my own love, stay.

The deer has left his rest, the bird is on the spray,

Stay, stay, stay, my own love, stay. 
THE DRUNKARD'S 
CHILD. 
W ords by HARRY ROBINSON, Music by FRANK DUMONT. 
Sung with great success by FRANK DUMONT. 
On father, stop drinking and leave it alone, 
Or we shall soon lose our nice little home ; 
You have grown so unkind, and cruel to mother, 
It frets me to death as well as dear brother. 
The landlord came here to-day for his rent, 
And says if you don't pay it he will make you repent; 
Oh say you will stop drinking from this very day, 
And for you, dear father, each night I 
will pray. 
CHORUS. 
It is better a 
child should never be born, 
Than to suffer such cruelty, shame and scorn. 
Dear mother has sat up for three nights or more, 
And you have come home and lain drunk on the floor, 
And so you sit there in such misery and shame, 
Dear father, dear father, don't do so again. 
My dear little child, you have opened my heart, 
I 
feel that from you I 
never can part; 
I 
promise to give up drinking ' my dear little Bliss. 
There, from you, dear father, I 
must have a 
kiss. 
It is better, etc.

NOTHING ELSE TO DO. 
NOTHING ELSE TO DO. 
New Version—Sung by JOHNNY BRASSIL. 
OH, kind friends, come and listen, 
And give me your attention, 
Unto a 
song I'm going to sing, 
And in it I 
will mention 
How I 
went into a 
bar-room once, 
To hear of something new, 
There I 
saw two men fighting, 
For they'd nothing else to do. 
I 
tried to separate them, 
But it only was in vain, 
For when I 
got one from the other, 
They went at it right again; 
The landlord said I 
was in fault 
To interfere between the two, 
So he kicked me out into the street, 
For he'd nothing else to do. 
I 
next went up to Niblo's, 
To pass away the time, 
There I 
saw a 
maiden fair, 
In capacious crinoline; 
She asked me if l'd see her home, 
For she lived at number two, 
Says I, " of course my love I 
will, 
For I've nothing else to do." 
She turned upon her heel and left, 
And to my great surprise, 
I 
found my watch and chain was gone, 
I 
could scarce believe my eyes; 
I 
turned around to look for her, 
She was nearly lost to view, 
I 
cried " come back "—says she, " I 
will, 
When I've nothing else to do."

GENTLE WORDS-
Ballad—Words by S. S. ADAMS, M IMIC 
by FRANK DUMONT. 
A GENTLE rose in summer time is beautiful to me, 
And glorious are the many stars that glimmer o'er the 
sea ; 
But gentle words and loving hearts, with hands to clasp 
my own, 
Are better than the fairest flower or stars that ever shone. 
The sun may warm the grass to life, the dew the droop-
ing dower, 
And eyes grow bright to see the light of autumn's open-
ing hour; 
Bless Um' every tear that falls, in its midst of sorrow tell, 
And make a 
fond meeting feel, like a 
most dear farewell. 
As far away from you I 
roam, I'll always think of thee, 
Your beaming eyes, my soul do thrill, speaking gentle 
words to me; 
Then in this life I'll joyous be whenever thou art near, 
But by the gate when twilight dawns, I'll haste to meet 
thee, dear. 
THE GAL WITH THE BLUE DRESS. 
As sung by JOHNNY BRASIL. 
OH, white folks I 
will sing to you, 
About my lovely Dinah; 
She is the aal that broke my heart, 
Way down in Alabama. 
She was tall and slender round the waist, 
And as purty as a 
Veneus ; 
GENTLE ADELAIDE . 
Of all the gals you ever saw, 
She was the greatest genius. 
cuourrS. 
So give me the gal with the blue dress on, 
The white folks call her Dinah ; 
She stole my heart and away she ran, 
'Way down in Alabama. 
I 
took my love to a 
ball last night, 
And when we went to supper 
She fainted and over the table did fell, 
And suck her nose in the butler. 
They tried champagne to fetch her to, 
But it was a 
little later, 
For a 
turkey leg ran in her eye, 
And she choked to death with a ' tater. 
Give me, etc. 
GENTLE ADELAIDE. 
Words by EUGENE STUART, Music by Fnmix DumoNT. 
Wu met, ' twas in the autumn, where the leaves did scat-
tered lie, • 
And to7ether roamed the wildwood, sweet Adelaide 
and I; 
Through the orchards and the meadows; and the wood-
land tinged with gold, 
Free from every care, we wandered in those happy days 
of old. 
CHORUS. 
'Twas in the autumn when golden was the sky, 
Together roamed the wildwood, sweet Adelaide and I. 
FLOATING DOWN THE STREAM. 
63 
How my heart did bound with pleasure when her fairy 
form I 
pressed, 
While her rosy cheeks lay nestled lovingly upon my 
breast ; 
And her eyes so soft and radiant thrilled my inmost soul 
with joy, 
For I 
loved this gentle maiden so delicate and coy. 
'Twas in the autumn, etc. 
But those halcyon days are ended, they will never come 
again, 
And no more with gentle Addle will I 
roam adown the 
glen ; 
Another's wooed and wc n 
hir, death claims her as his 
bride, 
Can ever I 
forget those hc urs 
hen she was by my side !

And loving lips would meet, while fondly we would

And life was honey sweet, when floating down the stream, 
Oh, life was honey sweet, when floating down the stream. 
The days that are no more, your echoes faintly fall, 
How pure, how pure, the hopes you bore, now gone be-

Till we in dreamless night, go floating down the stream, 
Till we in dreamless night, go floating down the stream.

And asked me for one glass of bier; 
He drinked it and said it was bully, another, 
And he rubbed his belly right here ; 
Ile called for more lager, tin Switzer kase, too, 
And he said that was first rate ; 
When axed for dose money, he says 
So mit eye, says, " put that down on de slate."

Since I, a 
baby, entered life; 
It's fifty years on Monday next, 
Since I 
got married and took a 
wife; 
My wife is living and so am I, 
Since then we never had cause to weep, 
So we're resolved in real old style 
Our " golden wedding" we're going to keep.

Then we shall laugh and sing away, 
We'll dance and have such lots of fun; 
And all the merry old folks I 
know, 
To our " golden Ivedding 
are going to come. 
We've fourteen daughters, fifteen sons, 
Grandchildren we've got sixty-three, 
And yet it seems scarce a 
year 
Since our first little boy climbed on my knee ; 
And once a 
year we all do meet, 
The neighbors say what a 
splendid lot.

Maria Jane and myself, they say; it's no wonder the

boys and girls are such fine ones, because they come of 
a 
splendid stock. 
Then we shall laugh, etc. 
My wife and I 
each evening sit 
Together and joke and sing our song; 
And we drink our jorum of whiskey punch, 
I 
make it myself and I 
make it strong; 
But sometimes it will happen to be 
A 
little too much we take by chance; 
Then my old wife will say, " look out old man," 
And off together we both do dance. 
Then we shall laugh, etc.

As lively as a

'We're often told that when we're old, 
We all should hold our tongue ; 
And it is right, both day and night, 
To go it while you're young. 
I'm eighty-five, yet I'm alive; 
When I 
shall reach five score, 
It's very plain I 
will be young again, 
And go it all the more.

THERE is a

In a 
girl that I 
have seen ; 
And my heart beats fast as she goes past, 
In a 
dark dress trimmed with green; 
Her eyes are bright as twinkling stars, 
So loving and so shy; 
And people turn and look at her, 
Whenever she goes by. 
CHORUS. 
And I 
feel just as happy as a 
big sunflower, 
That nods and bends in the breezes ; 
And my heart's as light as the summer winds, 
That blows all the leaves from the trees-es. 
As time passed on and we became, 
Like friends of olden times, 
I 
thought the question I 
would pop, 
And asked her to be mine. 
The-answer I 
received next day, 
How could she treat me so 7 
When I 
ask her to be mine, 
She only answered no. 
And I 
feel, etc. 
I 
went next day dressed in my best, 
This young girl for to see, 
And asked her if she would explain 
Why she had shaken me. • 
She said, " I 
really feel quite sad, 
To cause you such distress ;" 
And when I 
asked her, " do be mine," 
She simply answered, " yes."

And after him I
