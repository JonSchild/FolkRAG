TO THE PUBLIC. 
DELEHANTY and FIENGLER'S "Oh, My jennie! Oh, 
Sweet Jennie," Songster, contains more popular songs 
than any song book as yet published. 
A 
perusal of the 
contents will justify that statement ; being a 
compilation 
of all the most beautiful ballads of the day, the choicest 
and most popular songs and dances, the greatest serio-
comic hits, the sweetest sentimental songs and recitations ; 
comprising as it does, character sketches, viz., English 
swell songs and humor, Irish tales, songs and dances, 
German songs, jokes and sketches, and the sweetest of 
plantation songs and melodies. 
Messrs. Delehanty and Hengler lay claim to have writ-
ten and composed more songs and dances, ballads and 
sketches, than any other two men in the profession, or 
out of it, according to their ages. 
They claim to have 
performed in public the first double clog dance, the first 
double song and dance, and are the originators of all the 
different styles ; first to originate, compose and perform 
" 
Shoo Fly, Don't Bodder 'Me ; " " home and Kiss Me ;" 
"Apple of My Eye ; " " Love Among the Roses ; " " Sweet 
Camilla May ; " " Where the 
Woodbine Twineth 
" 
Where Flowers Blush and Bloom ; " " The Lily of the 
Valley ; " " The One I 
Dearly Love ;" " Martha Jane 
Berne ; " " Little Prairie Flower ; " " I 
couldn't Stay 
away ; " " The Happy Hottentots ; " " Violets Dipped in 
Dew ; " " Beautiful Blue-bells ; " " Walking in the Star-
light ; " " Dancing in the Moonlight ; " " Pretty Little 
Jessie ; " " I 
Hope I 
Don't Intrude ;" " Love Among the 
Flowers ; " " Aoy, -What de' ye' saoy ; " " The Fascin-
ating Fellow ; " " Strawberries and Cream ;" " She's a 
Darling, She's a 
Daisy ; " " I 
Trust You Will Excuse ;" 
" 
O'Brien, Keep Off the Grass ; " " To Bless the Old 
Man's Heart ; " " Beautiful Pink and White Roses 
" 
Take Away the One I 
Hate and Bring the One I 
love to 
Me ;" and their " Silver Dancing Apollo ; " " Oh, My 
Jennie ! Oh, Sweet Jennie." 
The great gift that these 
gentlemen possess is the power of writing both words and 
music, and adapting them so correctly to suitable and 
appropriate action. 
They seldom, if ever, sing or dance 
any music that is not their own. 
Most every songster 
contains some of these gentlemen's songs. 
But this book 
contains a 
choice collection of their most beautiful and 
popular songs of the day. 
PUBLISHER. 
OH! MY JENNIE! OH! SWEET JENNIE!. 
Partly written and composed by W . 
H. 
DELEHANTY. 
OH 
! 
my Jennie ! Oh! my Jennie, 
Time flies quickly by; 
Sure the lanes will have their turnings, 
Tho' the travellers die. 
Mark the swallow's flight, oh, Jennie, ' 
Pointing to the sky— 
Waiting as my love waits, Jennie, 
Till the clouds go by, 
Looking like my love looks, Jennie, 
Till the clouds of care go by. 
Oh ! my Jennie ! 
Oh, sweet Jennie, 
Time flies quickly by; 
Bear with me in patience, Jennie, 
Till (he clouds go by, 
Bear with nie in patience, Jennie, 
Till the clouds of care go by. 
As the dew is to the flowers, 
E'er the sun at morn 
Kisses off its magic power, 
And leaves the rose forlorn, 
So am I 
without thee, Jennie. 
Heavy comes the sigh, 
But prayer will lighten sorrow, Jennie, 
Till the clouds go by ; 
Joy will come to-morrow, Jennie, 
When the clouds of care go by. 
Oh! my Jennie, etc. 
TWO IN ONE. 
Words and music composed by W. IL DELEIIANTY. 
OH 
I 
listen to me—no, listen to us he moans, 
Because we are a 
we! 
I, myself and me! And 0, we us are one. 
And we are friends; yes, we are friends of course, 
As you can plainly see. 
I, myself and me ! And 0, we us in fun. 
CTIOMJS. 
And we sing and dance quite merrily, 
For to pass the time right cheerily ; 
While we may chaff, yes, and we laugh, ha, ha! 
From morning until night; 
And although we're two, we rank A. No. 1. 
There is a 
gal—yes, there's a 
gal loves me I 
No, me !—No, me !—Us both— 
That's the easiest way to settle all disputes. 
And we are off—yes, we are going now— 
This yellow gal to see; 
For to find out which of us her fancy suits. 
CHORUS. 
There we'll tell our love tales over, 
And find out which may love her; 
And if it's me—Or if it's me—of course 
We'll bow to fate's decree, 
And we'll greet you still with smiles and chaste salutes.

SWEET HAPPY DAYS. 
Words and music written by W. H. 
DELEHANTY. 
Oir ! I 
never shall forget the happy days, 
Happy days! Happy days ! 
When upon the old plantation. 
All the darkeys took vacation, 
And they left their heavy work 
And went to play. 
Then we took the banjo, fiddle and the bones, 
And the bones 
And the bones ! 
And you ought to hear the ringing, 
Of the merry voices singing, 
In the chorus of the dulcimatic tones. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! happy days I 
sweet happy days I 
When we took the banjo, fiddle and the bones, 
And the bones I And the bones I 
Yes, you ought to hear the ringing, 
Of the merry voices singing, 
In the chorus of the dulcimatic tones. 
Oh ! I 
never shell forget Miss Susie Brown, 
Susie Brown ! 
Susie Brown I 
Yes, the beauty of her mouth, 
Was a 
picture of the South, 
And they say she was " the Belle of the town." 
We used to be together all the while, 
All the while ! 
All the while I 
And she looked so very charming, 
That I 
couldn't see the harm, in 
A 
kissing her until I 
made her smile. 
Oh ! happy days, etc. 
CHARMING LITTLE KITTY. 
Words and music by W. H . 
DELETLINTY. 
THERE'S a 
maiden in this city. 
Twice as fair and twice as pretty 
As the early, smiling, dew-besprinkled rose, 
Or the lily, or the mignonettes, 
The heliotrope or violets ! 
There's none of them such beauty can disclose. 
Her eyes are blue and bright, 
Her teeth are pearly white ; 
And nature painted roses in her cheeks. 
She js roguish, and she's witty, 
Is my pretty little Kitty ! 
And you hear a 
choir of angels when she speaks. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, yes I 
love my Kitty so. (Symph.) 
And she loves me, yes, that I 
know. (Symph.) 
Oh ! you ought to hear me talking, 
When I'm out with Kitty walking, 
And she leans so gracefully upon my arm. 
Then to see me throw the style on, 
With my gallus little tile on, 
And you bet a 
pile on, like a 
charm. 
Underneath the sweet magnolia— 
Now, remember what I 
told yer— 
, That's the place I 
met Miss Kitty Allilee. 
Where the sweet magnolia blossom 
Sheds its petals on her bosom ; 
And I 
had to brush them off so lovingly ; 
But she seemed to half decline 
When I 
said, " Will you be mine ? " 
And I 
pressed her closer to my loving breast. 
Then she said, " You may repent it— 
Hasty weddings are relented! " 
That was all she said, but you can guess the rest.

If ever I 
7o to the races I'm sure 
To come home with far less than I 
start, 
For even if I 
back the horse that has won;

I'm a 
pretty good player at billiards. I'm told, 
I 
can handle the cards pretty well: 
But I'm hound to be done if I 
play for much gold, 
The reason I 
really can't tell. 
For perhaps just a 
game or two I 
may win, 
That is, if the stakes are but small, 
But when at the finish, I 
lose all my tin, 
I'm forced to admit after alk—that— 
Cno:—They're a

With the fair sex I'm no better off, I 
declare, 
I 
can't get on that way at all; 
Except the girl turns out more turly than fair, 
Or her fortune--'tis wretchedly small. 
Tho' the wealthy and 5.tly are awfully fond 
Of flirting just in a 
mild way; 
But as for the ladies !,oing beyond, 
From experience I'm bound to say,—that— 
Cuo:—They're a 
little too old for iie, 4q.

THE FAIR UNKNOWN. 
Written by W. H. 
DELEHANrY. 
I 
s.ily the crowd was gatheeing round 
A 
something prostrate on the ground, 
And thought, what can it be ? 
While moving nearer to the spot, 
Like others, anxious to know what 
Was there so great to see. 
When lo ! a 
maiden, young and fair, 
With violet eyes and golden hair, 
A 
face serene and sweet, 
Unsheltered from the summer's sun, 
Lay prostrate there upon the stone, 
In garment plain but neat. 
Ah ! pity awed, I 
viewed her there 
Coldly sweet and deadly fair— 
Somebody's darling daughter. 
And musing—was it fit or faint ? 
Dead was she to all complaint. 
They bathed her head with water, 
At last, and now the Doctor came. 
One look he gave and muttered shame. 
My heart with pity sank--
And wistfully he turned away. 
I 
guessed it all—he need not say, 
She's dead .1— said he—dead drunk 
MORAL. 
" 
The sweet spirit heard her prayer." 
HANNAH! HANNAH! WON'T YOU BE MY 
BRIDE ? 
Written and composed by W. H. 
DELEIIANTY. 
BOY.—DON'T you see my little love, 
Isn't she a 
turtle dove ? 
Smiling, beguiling, happy all the day ; 
You can see the sunny South 
In her great big codfish mouth ; 
Hannah, Hannah, don't you run away. 
Gnu,—No, indeed, goody John, 
I 
will stick when all are gone 
You can bet your life upon 
Every word I 
say. 
Boy. -=-Hannah makes me feel so queer, 
I 
could dance upon my ear, 
When I 
know she's standing by my side ; 
Come and kiss me ere I 
die, 
Hit me with a 
custard pie, 
Hannah, Hannah, won't you be my bride ? 
CHORUS. — Duet. 
Take me where the sunbeams linger, 
Near the Mississippi tide ; 
Place the ring upon my linger, 
Hannah, Hannah, then will be your bride. 
BOY.—Oh, give me wings and let me fly, 
Let me go up in the sky. 
Hannah, oh, Hannah, you stole my heart away ; 
Oh, come and take ane out of pain. 
Give me back my heart again, 
Hannah, Oil, Hannah, hear me what I 
say. 
would, dear John, that's if I 
could, 
Because I 
know I 
really should ; 
A man with a 
heart's no good, 
Now this is understood. 
Boy.----01), keep it, Hannah, all your life, 
. Say you'll be my darling wife, 
Then I'll be happy as the world is wide 
When I 
know I've got your heart, 
We shall never, never part ; 
Hannah, Hannah, won't you be my bride ? 
Take me, etc. 
A LAWDY DAWDY FELLOW. 
Characteristic, of a 
Lady Killer. 
Words and music by T. M. HENGLER. 
Copyright, 1877, A. 
J. 
FISHER, 98 Nassau Street. 
I'Aar a 
charming, captivating, fascinating fellow. 
Where ere I 
stray, the ladies say, 
Oh, isn't he a 
swell, O. 
They pet, and treat me tenderly, 
And call me lady killer, 
They laugh, they sigh as I 
pass by, 
I'm so awfully deuced clever. 
By jingo, I'm so charming, and their darling. 
CHORUS. 
I'm the ladies' choice, by Jove, 
A 
handsome, charming swell, 0 ; 
By jingo, how the ladies sigh, 
For this Lawdy Dawdy Fellow. 
I'm known at Saratoga, 
Long Branch oft I 
visit, 
The ladies fair at me stare, 
And say, isn't he exquisite. 
I'm lady-like in fancy, 
In form and style a 
stunner, 
In the mazy waltz, the polka too, 
They sigh to be my partner. 
I'm the ladies, etc. 
MAGGIE IS DEAD. 
Written by W. H. DELEHANTY, and respectfully inscribed to .1, 
A. 
DELEHANTY, Albany, N. Y. 
AND this was a • beautiful Sabbath morning, 
When all the land was calm and bright, 
The birds and flowers gave quiet warning, 
Behold ! God's holy day of light. 
Bells in church spires solemnly pealing 
Echoes resounding censure and blame, 
Touching the infidel's inner heart feeling, 
Causing his conscience to tremble with shame. 
After the service of prayer and devotion, 
The Christians arise from their prayers, and retreat 
Homeward, more pleased and glad with the notion, 
They answered God's calling and acted discreet; 
So felt we all that bright Sunday morning, 
Hearts warm and light with love's holy flame, 
Till a 
knock on the door loud and sharp, gave us warning, 
A 
messenger boy with a 
telegram came. 
Silence ! we opened the envelope's sealing— 
Listened we all to hear what it said, 
Trembled the voice (while sad tears were stealing), 
Uttered these words, " Our Maggie is dead." 
Ali I 
light, too slight, too bright a 
package, 
For the woeful burthen of death it had ; 
Four little words made a 
sorrowful message, 
That one short line—" Our Maggie is dead." 
Our primrose plucked in the prime of life, 
Our Maggie, so good, so pure and so fair, 
When scarcely mother, and scarcely Avife, 
Generous, gentle, benign and rare, 
Perhaps too good and fair for earth, 
Or else—oh ! why did the angels come 
And take our darling, our prize of worth, 
Our dear sweet comfort and joy of home. 
Oh! Maggie, God sent thee an offspring, 
Fruit of thy marriage and bond of love, 
Like as an angel (gracious offering), 
To bear thy soul to heaven above. 
• 
Sweet child—it came, it- smiled, it vanished, 
Then tears from your sad heart swelled in your eyes, 
You followed soon after your babe to heaven, 
To meet him again in paradise. 
THE ELEGANT EBONY GUARDS. 
Words and music by W. II. DELEHANTY. 
SOLDIERS, gallant and gay, 
Gallant and gay, gallant and gay, 
Dressed in a 
grand array. 
Dressed in a 
grand array. 
Oh ! how the ladies smile, 
The ladies smile, the ladies smile 
At our elegant style, 
Elegant style and way. 
When we are out on the march, 
Out on the march, yes, out on the march, 
Officers stiffened as starch, 
In the elegant Ebony Guards. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, we look grand, 
As we march along the street, 
The ladies smile, 
And wave their handkerchiefs. 
The men admire, 
And say we look so neat, 
Colonel and major, 
Of the elegant Ebony Guards. 
Soldiers, gallant and grand, 
Gallant and grand, gallant and grand, 
Fit to obey and command, 
Fit to obey and command, 
Men with a 
heart and a 
hand, 
A 
heart and a 
band, a 
heart and a 
hand, 
True to a 
nation's demand, 
True to a 
nation's demand, 
Those who are willing to fight, 
Yes, willing to fight, yes, willing to fight, 
Nobly with courage and might, 
In the elegant Ebony Guards. 
Yes, we look grand, etc. 
BEAUTIFUL PINK AND WHITE ROSES. 
Words and music written by W. H. DELEHASTY. 
As the merry birds that warble in the trees, 
Or the wild flowers that scent the summer breeze, 
As I 
wander here and there, without a 
thought of care, 
My happiness does every hour increase. 
How sweet to love and be loved in return. 
When modest maiden cheeks begin to burn, 
And eyes of diamond light outshine the glare at night, 
To wake from blissful dreams at early dawn. 
Oh dear ! the tender passion love, 
How beautiful bewildering you seem! 
Like a 
boon descending from above, 
Elysium the rapture of a 
dream. 
Oh ! bright and merry pass the hours away, 
And time but makes the moments glad and gay, 
As I 
wander through the grove to sing of her I 
love, 
And like the birds I 
carol forth my lay. 
CHORUS. 
Beautiful pink and white roses, (
Symph.) 
Culled from a 
garden of posies. 
Lovely verdant gem so rich and rare, 
flow sweetly you deck my darling's hair; 
You linger in my mind as something good and kind, 
Because you make my darling twice as fair. 
There's an ivy-covered cottage in the lane 
With its rustic little portico so plain ; 
A 
charming little spot, a 
lovely garden plot 
Where every kind of flower blooms amain ; 
But the pride of all the garden is the rose 
Which here and there in great profusion grows ; 
The lovely violet and fragrant mignonette, 
There is none of them such beauty can disclose; 
But fairer far is Flora's face to see, 
It pierced me into my very soul 
The day she pulled those pretty flowers for me 
And pinned them in my button-hole. 
Oh I 
since that time I 
placed them in ray book, 
Where now and then my eyes with rapture look; 
They make my heart rejoice to know they were her choice, 
The roses pink and white from her I 
took. 
Beautiful pink and wit roses, etc.

THE LAND OF DREAMS. 
As sung by T. M. HENGLER. 
IN 
the pleasant summer evening, 
I 
lie beneath the shade, 
Watching the shadows 
That dance on the meadows, 
When the day begins to fade; 
When the sweet remembrance comes to me 
Like a 
long forgotten strain 
Of music, awaking 
And freshly breaking 
Over my heart again. 
In visions of the past, 
I 
see my love arise. 
And in my dreaming 
I 
feel the beaming 
Of her soft, compassionate eyes. 
Ah! thus may saddened hearts renew 
Their life's pure morning beams, 
On the past to ponder, 
And softly wander, 
Into—The Laud of Dreams. 
I 
TRUST YOU WILL EXCUSE. 
(Companion to " I 
Hope I 
don't Intrude.") 
Words and music by the same author—W. H. DELEHANTY. 
You will please to give me your attention, 
For just a 
little while ; 
Until I 
with pleasure mention her, 
" 
The Belle of Amberisle." 
She's the neatest and the sweetest maiden 
My heart could ever choose, 
And if I 
now sing and dance with joy 
I 
trust you will excuse. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, when I 
hear the music play (
Sym.) 
I 
feel so happy I 
could throw myself away ; (
Sym.) 
Yes, I 
feel so good I 
can't keep from singing, 
My joy it is profuse, 
And the heeltaps will keep ringing, but, 
I 
trust you will excuse. 
I 
shall never forget the moonlight picnic 
They gave at " Amberisle 
How the pleasures were ecstatic for 
The best of " bon ton " style. 
It was there 1 
met my heart's best treasure, 
" 
Sweet idol of my muse," 
And when I: asked to see her home 
She said, " I 
can't refuse." 
Oh, when I 
hear, etc. 
Just the other day I 
popped the question, 
She said, " I 
can't decline." 
So a 
cottage on the Hudson banks 
Will be her home and mine. 
We invite you all to call and see us, 
And hope you won't refuse; 
And if kindness fails to greet you there, 
I 
trust you will excuse. 
Oh, when I 
hear, eta. 
MY BEAU IDEAL. 
Words and music written by W. H. DELEHANTT. 
W HILE leisurely meandering, 
In dreamy, pensive thought, 
I 
chanced to meet a 
maiden 
Who fairly won my heart; 
A 
perfect little beauty, 
Which caused my heart to feel 
With pleasure rife, to be my wife— 
She was my beau ideal. 
CHORUS. 
First a 
blush, and then a 
smile, 
Winning my poor heart all the while. 
The love that swelled my bosom 
Was ardent, pure and real; 
This sweet magnolia blossom, oh ! 
She is my beau ideal. 
Allow me now to mention 
The way we came to speak : 
'Twas by my own invention 
Which caused a 
little cheek. 
I 
walked up close beside her, 
My feelings did reveal ; 
She only smiled, but so beguiled 
My heart ! my beau ideal. 
First a 
blush, etc. 
Said I, fair maid, I'm lonely, 
The hours so slowly glide 
For want of some companion 
In . whom I 
may confide. 
She blushed and smiled and uttered, 
That's just the way I 
feel ; 
And thus it ends, we're now fast friends, 
And sliQ's my beau ideal.

BRING THE ONE I 
LOVE TO ME. 
Words and music by W. II. DELEUANTY (a 
characteristic dizzy blonde). 
HAPPY be thy dreams, dear Charley, 
When you're out at sea •, 
While you're on the raging ocean 
I'll be true to thee. 
Yet dearly as I 
love thee, Charley, 
Or as you love me, 
Some other one may take my italic' 
While you are off to sea. 
Father wants me for to marry 
Some one that I 
hate ; 
Hurry, Charley, do not tarry, 
Save me from that fate, oh ! 
Powers above, do guide my Charley 
Safe across the sea, 
And take away the one I 
hate, 
But bring my love to me. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, yes, I 
will be true to Charley, 
While he's out at sea. 
Oh, take away the one I 
hate, 
And bring my love to me. 
Charley's eyes are bright as diamonds, 
Laughing all the while, 
And he is so brave and noble, 
I 
should rather smile ; 
You should hear him play his fiddle, 
As round the room I'd go, 
To chassez up and down again, 
And then he'd rosin his bow. 
But oh, the gawk that comes to see me 
Every night at eight— 
And I'm compelled to go and meet him 
At the garden gate. 
Oh ! burry, Charley, hurry, darling, 
It's you I 
long to see. 
Oh ! take away the one I 
hate, 
And bring my love to me. 
Oh, yes, etc.

LOVELY LINDA LANE. 
Worns and music written by W. II. DELEUANTY, expressly for Mn. Jonikt 
STANLEY. 
I DEARLY love a 
maiden, 
Whose eyes are bright and blue, 
With ruby lips love-laden, 
Like violets dipped in dew. 
Her sunny smile of brightness 
Would pierce you thro' and thro', 
Her heart is glad with lightness, 
Because she's good and true. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! 
Malinda ! 
Sweet Malinda, 
Soon she'll be my bride, 
Hoping to always linger near her, 
Caring for naught beside, 
Oh, Linda, (
Symph.) sweet Linda do, 
My own sweet Linda Lane. 
I 
did not mean to mention 
The secrets of my heart ; 
It was not my intention 
Such secrets to impart. 
But music sets me crazy, 
I 
know not what to do, 
For Linda is a 
daisy, 
So fair and pure and true. 
Oh! Malinda, etc. 
There's none so fair as Linda 
In all this world so wide, 
The ring is on her finger, 
And soon she'll be my bride. 
But please excuse my freedom, 
My heart is full of glee, 
And all for love of Linda, 
Who's all the world to me. 
Oh! Malinda, etc.

TO BLESS THE OLD MAN'S HEART. 
Words and music composed by T. M. 
DENGLER. 
W HEN a 
boy at school, I 
improved each hour, 
And wrought and strove from morn till night, 
So little by little increased my store, 
And found my prospects getting quite bright. (Sym.) 
At last I 
bought a 
stock and farm, 
Successful was, got a 
wife and home, 
Then I 
began to feel home's charm, 
And vowed no more again I'd roam. (
Synz.) 
CHORUS. 
My wants are small, my farm is large, 
I 
bid my cares depart. 
I've a 
happy wife and children three. 
To bless the old man's heart. 
(Repeat chorus.) 
Youth, they say, will have its fling, 
And social joys we love to share ; 
But let prudence always be the thing 
To keep the morrow free from care. (Sym.) 
And to be healthy, wealthy and wise, 
Remember, if translated right, 
Is early to bed and early to rise, 
And don't stay out too late at night. (
Sym.) 
My wants are small, etc. 
Of trouble each man gets his share, 
And to avoid it we should try_ 
Endeavor to make the least of care, 
And lose no time in such employ. (
Sin.) 
Now you young folks keep this in mind, 
Aim for success and noble ends, 
And when you're old, then both combined 
Will bring you bliss and faithful friends. (Sym.) 
My wants are small, etc. 
ERIN'S EMBLEMS. 
Written and composed by W. H. 
DELEUANTY. 
I 
wEAR two lovely emblems, 
United on my breast, 
The honored " Harp of Erin," 
That land I 
love the best. 
A 
darling treasured ";slauarock," 
So modest to be seen. 
That harp that shines with glory, 
The shamrock so lair and green. 
CHOln-S. 
My blessings on those emblems 
Of Erin across the sea. 
May they adorn the banners 
Proclaiming Ireland free. 
The reason why I 
wear them, 
So closely to my heart, 
Those gems of priceless treasure, 
United never to part, 
Because that little shamrock 
Was fair and pure to see, 
The harp was like the utterings 
Of mother love to me. 
My blessing on those, etc. 
My mother wrought that gold harp 
With tresses of her hair ; 
Green threads of father's jacket, 
Did make a 
Shamrock fair. 
Mv firther kissed and blessed me 
Before I 
crossed the sea. 
And bade me wear those emblems, 
" 
For mother dear and me." 
My blessings on those, etc. 
I'M GOING TO MEET MY SISTER. 
Words and music by W . 
H. 
DELEIIANTY. 
W HEN I 
landed in New York, 
All the way from Cushaloch, 
Where the black birds sung their notes of lamentation 
In every little lay, 
Sure I 
thought I 
heard them say 
May good luck attend you, Pat, in every station. 
When I 
landed in New York 
Sure I 
thought that I'd get work, 
But I 
found that was a 
matter rather hard, so 
I 
must emigrate out West ; 
There I 
think I'll do the best 
When I 
meet my sister Katie in Chicago. 
CHORUS. 
In Chicago, in the State of Illinois; 
But before I 
say adieu 
I 
will take a 
step or two 
Just as graceful as a 
little lustiardo. 
So blaze away and tear, 
Now the divil a 
hair I 
care, 
For I'm going to meet my sister in Chicago. 
Down at Castle Garden gate, 
Sure it's there I 
had to wait, 
Now I 
know ye's all will say it was a 
pity; 
The divil a 
one I 
found 
Who would show a 
Paddy round, 
So you see I'm led astray now in your city. 
And no matter where I 
be, 
All the boys make game of me, 
And they holler pipe the tarrier Bernardo; 
With their cry, " What d'ye saoy ? " 
Faith me heart knows little joy, 
Till S. ?Acet my sister Katie in Chicago, 
In Chicago, etc. 
GLIDING DOWN LIFE'S STREAM, 
Words and music by W . 
H. 
DELEHANTY. 
BRTTOLD! my love, my life, my pet, 
We're gliding slowly down life's stream? 
Without one murmur of regret; 
For all is love's sweet joy supreme, 
Heaven-born love, the only theme 
The heart reveres, but can't forget ; 
Ah ! may we ne'er wake from this dream 
Of holy bliss, but slumber yet. 
CITOEIJS. 
'Twere sweet to always slumber thus,' 
To know no waking from this dream 
That holds the boon of love to us, 
While gliding slowly down life's stream. 
We've sealed our fates, and side by side 
We wander in the way of love, 
With God our Father for our guide, 
We needs must land in heaven above. 
Dear wife, as onward we now rove, 
As it-hen there comes the turn of tide, 
Be sure our acts and deeds do prove 
Us both —a

PLORALINE. 
Words and music by W . 
H. 
DELEHANTY. 
W HEN the daylight darkened into dusk, 
And the stars peeped out above, 
While the moon showered down its silver light, 
I 
wandered with my love. 
The wild flowers breathed a 
scent of love, 
As if to greet their queen, oh! 
And the goldfinch sang an evening hymn, 
To welcome Floraline. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! my, there's such a 
charm about her, (Sym.) 
And. I 
cannot live without her, (
Sym.) 
Oh ! her presence makes life one long day 
Of happiness serene ; 
And I 
could not say too much in praise 
Of my sweet Flora. 
Oh ! they say there is no romance now, 
That love is growing old, 
That pleasure has a 
business face, 
And joy is made of gold. 
But I 
must say in simple faith, 
No matter what has been, oh 
I 
only know I 
live for love 
Of my sweet Floraline. 
Oh my, etc. 
Oh, the days will come, the days will 
But hope will hold its power, 
And righteousness will guide a 
way, 
To bless each passing hoar. 
And I'll love her while she loves me ; 
And when she's sweet sixteen, oh, 
I 
will place the gold ring on the hand 
Of my sweet Floraline. 
Oh ! my, etc. 
LEFT OUT IN THE COLD. 
Written by Wm. H. DELEHANTY. 
ALL alone and sad hearted, 
A 
waif on the street, 
With no one to pity me, 
No friend to meet, 
I 
think of my playmates, 
And stories they told— 
Of poor, homeless orphans, 
Left out in the cold. 
CHORUS. 
Out in the cold, out in the cold, 
Motherless, fatherless, out in the cold. 
I 
note the smile sadden, 
O'er-burdened by grief, 
They only look pity, 
But give no relief. 
Oh ! why can't the passers-by— 
Goodness unfold. 
The gift of one penny 
Saves many from cold. 
Out in the cold, etc. 
Tho' life may be lovely, 
And happiness dear, 
Grim dAth cold and lonely, 
Dark, dismal and drear. 
My poor heart is breaking, 
With sorrows untold, 
And death holds a 
sweetness. 
I'm out in the cold. 
Out in the cold, etc.

Written and composed by JERRY D . 
McCATITur. 
Sung with great success by Dick LITTLE 
CALLENDER'S Georgia Min-
strels. 
On, the old home is sad now and dreary, 
The darkeys sing about the place no more, 
They have all gone from the old plantation, 
The banjo now hangs silent on the door. 
Oh, it's all that remains of the children, 
Of the ones that have cherished me so dear, 
And no more will I 
hear their voices singing 
The good old songs my heart rejoiced to hear. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the old home is sad now and dreary, 
(Bass alone) Sad and dreary, for 
The darkeys sing about the place no more, 
They have all gone from the old plantation, 
(Bass alone) And the banjo, 
The banjo now hangs silent on the door. 
Oh, but time makes me fondly remember, 
At evening when the toiling day was done, 
How the folks used. to sing and play the banjo, 
For trouble in those good times we had none 
But their forms in the grave now lie sleeping, 
So dear to me in happy days of yore, 
And I'm left here alone all day weeping, 
The banjo now hangs silent on the door. 
Oh, the old home, etc. 
Now old age has come on, and I'm weary, 
The few locks that are left me are quite gray; 
Round the farm ev'ry day I'm wandering, 
Yes, wandering, for I 
soon must pass away. 
So you'll please listen now and remember, 
When the poor colored man shall be no more, 
Take good care, kind friends, and part with never 
The banjo hanging on the cabin door. 
Oh, the old home, etc.

BEAUTIFUL BLUE BELLS. 
Words and music by W. H. D ELEIIANTY. 
BEAUTIFUL blue bells, wet with morning dew, 
Emblems of you, dear, fair and pure and true— 
Proofs of affection which I 
feel for you— 
Beautiful blue bells, wet with morning dew. 
That's the sweet epistle which I 
sent to-day 
To my little sweetheart, Annie, over the way. 
Then there came an answer, loving, kind and true— 
Thanks for those sweet posies, blue bells wet with dew. 
CHORUS. 
That's the way I 
won her, (
Syniph.) 
It is, upon my honor. (Symph.) 
My life is blissful since I 
sent, to-day, 
Those pretty flowers to Annie, o'er the way. 
But she is sweeter, fairer far than you, 
Beautiful blue bells, wet with morning dew. 
Now, every evening you can find me there, 
In that little cottage with my love so fair, 
Wooing and cooing like two little doves— 
Pleasure pursuing, while exchanging loves. 
Then if you had seen her sitting by my side, 
When I 
asked the question, " Will you be my bride ?" 
How she blushed and trembled, and her eyes so blue, 
t_Looked just like those flowers, blue bells wet with dew. 
That's the way, eto.

CHARLEY. 
THERE'S a 
lovely little maiden, 
Living down in yonder lane, 
Who has promised that she'd see me here to-night; 
And my heart with love is laden. 
Oh ! the sweet, delicious pain, 
That enraptured hearts experience with delight I 
And oh I 
she is charming 
As the flowers in May; 
Or as lovely as a 
peach in the fall I 
And I 
couldn't see the harm in 
Giving her my love to-day, 
For I 
think she's sweetest of them all 
CHORUS. 
She's my own—my heart's desire— 
Is my dark-eyed sweet Maria 
Oh! tell me why you wink your eye, 
You roguish little butterfly ! 
As if you know the reason I 
am here. 
And merrily from every tree, 
The pretty warblers sing to me 
Because they know Maria loves me, dear 
Now I 
wonder, where's Charley ? 
Surely, this is where he said 
That he'd meet me when the evening's shadows fell. 
Maybe I 
have come too early;

Or perhaps he has delayed,

And now, I

Never ask me, Charley, darling 
Long as you may ever live;

W E'RE in love with two fair sisters, 
Violet and Rosalee ; 
His is all the world to him, 
And mine is all the world to me. 
In a 
little rustic cottage, 
Living happy as can be, 
There we go to see these sisters, 
Violet and Rosalee. 
CHORUS. 
We are called the merry-makors, 
Happy, nobby, gay and free ; 
And we dearly love those sisters, 
Violet and Rosalee. 
We are called the dancing statuettes, 
Apollo Belvideres; 
We win the hearts of pretty girls, 
Who call us darling dears. 
We love the girls with glossy curls, 
The roguish little pets ; 
We also love the Rosalees, 
And lovely Violets. 
CHORUS 
Oh, we laugh and sing. 
The heeltaps ring; 
The music sweetly plays. 
For love keeps sorrow 
From our hearts, 
And drives dull care away.

TaErtE is a

I 
meet her every day, 
She has a 
cunning, winning smile, 
And such a 
charming way ; 
Each time I 
chance to pass her by, 
She always smiles the same ; 
She dresses neat and so complete, 
I 
wonder what's her name. 
'CHORUS. 
Oh, she is so neat and so complete, 
She always smiles the same, 
I'd give the world if I 
knew, 
I 
wonder what's her name. 
(Repeat.) 
Last eve her elbow mine did touch, 
While standing in a 
throng, 
But quickly I 
apologized, 
And said, I 
mean no wrong; 
No harm, she said, for accidents, 
Like that are very tame. 
And then she left with a 
pretty smile, 
I 
wonder what's her name. 
Oh, she, etc. 
Perhaps to-night she's in the crowd, 
That has assembled here, 
With all my friends please look around,', 
And find this pretty dear; 
If here, whoever points her out 
I'll not the slightest blame; 
Oh, tell me where this darling is,

wonder what's her name. 
Oh, she, etc. 
LED ASTRAY. 
Written and composed by W . 
H. 
DELEHANTY. 
On, let me speak, departing soul, 
E'er gone to ne'er return ; 
That I 
may tell my wicked life 
To whom it may concern. 
It may, perchance, do some one good, 
And no one any harm ; 
But block the road that leads to ruin, 
Wrought by fair woman's charm. 
The maiden, pure in innocence, 
Unknown to care and strife, 
May learn what comes of ignorance, 
To blast an holy life, 
And find a 
moral in this tale ; 
For I 
was once as pure 
As snow, that scarce of heaven fell ; 
But I 
am pure no more. 
I 
never knew a 
mother's love, 
Nor felt her tender care ; 
For she did give her life for me— 
Ne'er blest me with a 
prayer. 
Though I 
was reared religiously, 
Was educated well, 
And moved in high society, 
Of which I 
blush to tell. 
LED ASTRAY.—Concludod. 
Blush, said I ? not blush, oh, no 
I 
lost that with my name ; 
And now but feel a 
justly throe 
As one deluged in shame. 
I 
heard him promise faith and love, 
To share my life as well. 
In ignorance I 
sealed my fate, 
And so, alas. I 
fell. 
My father turned me from his door, 
And cruel words he said; 
My sisters dared not speak to me, 
So from the right I 
fled. 
Oh, curses on the promises 
That brightened all the way; 
And palsied be that honeyed tongue 
That sweetened me astray. 
MORAL. 
Oh, innocence! oh, ignorance 
Oh, youth 
beware, beware I 
The path of love is beautiful, 
But ever hath a 
snare. 
E'en though ' tis decked with roses, 
The light of love adorns; 
Remember, where the flowers are, 
There's sure to be some thorns.

Now I'm going to tell you all a 
little story, 
But I 
promise you I'll not detain you long; 
It's about a 
darling, charming, little sweet one, 
She's the captivating subject of my song. 
But I'll tell you how we talked and how we flirted, 
When I 
met this belle: 
And ' twas then I 
called her little Dew D'Andies, 
For her name she would not tell. 
CHORUS. 
She's so sweet 
and so neat 
Oh I 
love the charming little Dew D'Andies, 
She's the sweetest girl that ever you did see, 
And she often sings me love among the roses. 
Now boys, she's just the girl for rue. 
When I 
met her first 'twas out upon a 
pic-nic, 
And I 
shall never forget her winning smile, 
For she danced and made the changes in the music, 
With her graceful pretty fascinating smile. 
Then I 
asked her for her name and her directions, 
For I'd like to cAll, 
Then she turned around and whispered Dew D'Andies, 
And she smiling said 'twos all. 
She's so sweet, ttc.„

LIKE A BEAUTIFUL DREAM. 
Written by W. H. DELEICANTY. 
ONE bright summer's night, when the pale moon was 
beaming, 
And gilding the earth with its rich, golden glow, 
The sweet scented flowers all dew-crystaled gleaming, 
Were hushed in deep sleep, clustered lovingly low. 
Then he came with his heart full of love to her window, 
And softly and sweetly he touched his guitar, • 
And sweetly and softly in accents like sorrow, 
He sang to his choice, to his love's guiding star. 
Awake ! darling mine, ' tis thy true lover calling, 
And well do I 
know thou'rt dreaming of me ; 
Look down from thy window, the dewdrops are falling, 
And chilling the love- words I 
send up to thee. 
There's no one but me, the moonlight is gleaming, 
And no gloomy clouds are afloat in the skies ; 
Awake ! oh, my darling, on soft pillow dreaming, 
And bless me with love—the light of your eyes. 
While thus the fond minstrel with love teeming over, 
Pours out his heart's thoughts on the chilly night air 
Watching her window, the true-hearted lover, 
With soul full of hope, her sweet face to shine there. 
But low fell his voice, his heart 'gan to flutter, 
Sharp words of her father rang out from above, 
" 
She is gone like a 
beautiful dream to Calcutta, 
Eloped.—now, for my sake, go sing to your love." 
nib, MOON IS OUT TO-NIGHT, LOVE. 
Sung by DELEHANTT and EtENGLEn. 
TnE moon is out to-night, love, floating through the sky, 
The little stars are laughing as she passes by, 
All the little songsters sing their pretty tune, 
Happy as they can be singing to the moon. 
Clquds of silver lining waiting in the sky, 
For the moon to pass them; Jessie, so am I. 
For I've come to meet you with a 
happy smile, 
To tell you how I 
love you, sitting on the stile. 
cnonus. 
The moon is out to-night, love, meet me with a 
smile, 
I've something sweet to tell you, sitting on the stile; 
Kiss me when you meet me, Jessie of the Glen, 
And when I 
go to leave you I'll give it back again. 
The moon is out to-night, love, all the roses blush, 
When the gentle night winds tell the birds to hush, 
For I 
want to listen for a 
merry voice, 
Whose every note is music, and makes my heart rejoice; 
Jessie, I 
am watching to see if I 
can see 
Some one like a 
fairy coming towards me; 
Ali: the little angel coming once again, 
I've a 
kiss of true love for Jessie of ti.e Glen. 
The moon is out, etc. 
THROUGH THE WOODS WE WANDERED. 
Written and composed by W. H. DELEHANTY. 
THRO' the woods we wandered, 
Little Maud and I; 
Leisurely meandered, 
Giving sigh for sigh. 
Blithe and merry-hearted, 
Arm-in-arm we went; 
All our loves imparted, 
Blest with sweet content. 
Thro' the woods we wandered, 
Lovely Maud and me; 
But a 
while we pondered, 
Near a 
shady tree. 
There she turned and faced me, 
Something sweet to say ; 
Trustingly embraced me, 
In her tender way. 
Thro' the woods we wandered, 
Maud and I 
alone; 
Where a 
brook ran onward, 
Making gentle moan. 
We had pulled two posies, 
Bound them side by side ; 
When we made proposes, 
Threw them in the tide. 
Thro' the woods we wandered, 
While the little stream 
Bore, these pledges onward, 
Bonds of our love dream. 
Secret vows we plighted, 
Sacred love and faith ; 
Like those flowers united, 
Ever until death. 
Now everybody wonders I'm so happy— 
They criticize my gay and airy style, 
But if they knew the- pretty little beauty 
That threw at me the sweetness of her mil; 
Frri sure they wouldn't. wonder I 
was airy, 
Nor think that I'm in any way to blame, 
When I 
say I 
gave my heart up to a 
fairy— 
Yes, " Little Fairy Dew Drop" is her name. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! yes, she's like a 
fairy, 
Blithesome and airy— 
outing lips of cherry, 
Smiling when we meet. 
Bright eyes when they view me, 
Piercing thro' and thro' me, 
Perfectly under me, 
Dow Drop is so sweet. 
One summer's day we went a- picking berries, 
So ripe and running wild upon the hill, 
how carelessly we trod upon the daisies, 
So anxious were we then the pail to fill ; 
And when the pail was full we sat and rested, 
'Twas just because I 
said she needed rest— 
And oh ! how very sweet the betries tasted 
With little Dew Drop leaning on my breast. 
Oh ! yes, etc. 
I 
told her then my life was very lonesome, 
And bluntly asked her would she be my wife, 
And tho . I 
said, I 
knew I 
wasn't handsome, 
Still, I 
hoped with love to bless her all her life ; 
She answered " yes," when we were homeward turning, 
Thro' fields where corn was waving high above, 
While I 
think to hug or kiss we were a- learning, 
I
t And no one heard our gentle tale of love. 
Oh yr's, etc.

how I 
love a 
pretty little girl 
Who lives in yonder lane, 
As sweet as sugar cane, 
Who's name is Ida Vane. 
Oh ! how she set ray brain to whirl 
When she said—" call again "— 
Down ill yonder lane—to-night— 
My pretty Ida Vane. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! charming little precious dear, (Symph.) 
How I 
wish that she was here. (Symph.) 
Oh ! then we'd take a 
quite little walk 
Adown the woodland grove, 
So leisurely we'll rove, 
And softly whisper love. 
Birds will listen for to hear us talk, 
And when they sing again, 
Their song shall be a 
song of love 
And pretty Ida Vane. 
Oh ! charming little, etc. 
Oh ! if you could only see her eyes, 
They shine like stars at night, 
So beautiful and bright, 
With a 
dazzling diamond light. 
Whoever gets her gets a 
prize ; 
He shall not woo in vain, 
For she's a " Flower of Paradise," 
My pretty Ida Vane. 
Oh ! charming little, etc. 
Oh ! see, the moon is shining clear, 
The stars are out at play— 
And sweetly did she say, 
" 
We'll meet at close of day !" 
Oh ! come and tell me, pretty little dear, 
And ease my heart of pain, 
Why keep me longer waiting here, 
My pretty Ida Vane. 
Oh ! charming little, etc.

ANESTACIA. 
Written by W . 
H. 
BELE HANTY. 
A 
TT ! muffle the harp—touch not a 
cord, 
Lest thou disturb her slumber sound--
Who sleeps the everlasting sleep ; ono word 
Would mar the holiness, profound! 
Poor Anestaeia lies silently there, 
Beneath that little new-made mound. 
Not her—but all that's left of her ; 
Her soul sweet Heaven has now enthron'd. 
"Dear mourners "—pray list to the story, 
Of an earthly angelic flight. 
\Tho vanished away in the glory 
Of Heaven's most radiant light! 
How, for years she had dwelt among us, 
And we learned to love her so ; 
But she left her soul's cold raiment 
To be buried beneath the snow. 
Anestacia ! We knew her an orphan, 
So fair, so pare and so mild; 
And the cares of nineteen summers 
Still left her but a 
child, 
Ethereal—sweet—angelic ! 
So tender, benign and good; 
With something divine about her, 
Which none of us understood. 
( 
1 ) 
ANESTACIA.—Concluded. 
When I 
saw the sad expression 
Her black eyes used to wear, 
It made me think of heaven, 
And sometimes say a 
prayer ; 
She seemed not ill, nor healthy— 
Not joyous, and yet content; 
Like a 
fair but drooping lily, 
When its bloom is nearly spent 
We loved her in our household, 
And hoped she'd always stay, 
But one bright summer morning, 
It seemed she flew away. 
Then we heard of how an angel 
Took flight to God above ; 
How she passed in perfect glory, 
To realms of bliss and love. 
She looked so fair in the coffin, 
With a 
smile so sweet and bland; 
Her beauty far outrivalled 
The lilies in her hand. 
Her dear friends gathered round her 
And tears of sorrow fell; 
And prayers were sent to heaven, 
Where she with God cloth dwell

BESSY DOON, THE SWEETEST OF THEM ALL. 
Written and Composed by Wm. 11 DELEHANTL 
On 1 I 
know a 
little maiden, 
By the name of " Bessy Peon," 
And by invitation I 
am going to call; 
And my heart with love is laden, 
Since we met this afternoon, 
When she blushed and said she loved me best of al 
And she looked just as charming— 
As the flowers in May, 
Or a 
peach ripe, ready for to fall. 
Oh ! I 
couldn't see the harm in— 
Giving her my heart to- day, 
For I 
really thiek she's the sweetest of them all. 
CHORUS . 
Oh! tell me why—you wink your eye, 
You roguish little butterfly, 
Or do you know on whom I'm going to call. 
While merrily on every tree 
The little birdies sing to me— 
Bessie is the sweetest girl of all. 
Now I 
was one of them who thought 
That love was all a 
myth, 
And I 
never gave it any heed at all! 
Cupid's quiver struck my heart and 
Wrote a 
verse be ,, inning with— 
Oh ! Bossy is t 
I 
le sweetest girl of all ; 
Then I 
felt just as happy 
As a 
bin' sunflower, 
Nodding in the breezes high and tall. 
Then I 
saw entrancing beauty, 
And I 
felt its tender power, 
For I 
love Miss Bossy Donn the best of all. 
Oh ! tell me why, etc. 
Ah ! I 
can no longer linger, 
For my time is growing short, 
But I 
hope to meet you all some day again; 
And if Bessie is a 
singer, 
Just to have a 
little sport 
I'll bring her here to sing a 
sad refrain. 
She will sing a 
sad farewell 
To the 'lobby little chaps— 
That dance in attendance to her call; 
Say adieu to every belle, 
For I'll marry soon perhaps, 
Miss Bossy Boon, the sweetest of them all. 
Oh ! tell me why, etc.

ROGUISH EISIALINE. 
Written by Wm. IL DELEnerrrY. 
I'm happy as the birds in Spring- time, 
That warble in the air, 
While they hop about from limb to limb, 
For the troubles of the world they little care. 
So 
that's the very way I'm feeling, 
The reason I 
will tell, 
I'm in love as you can plainly see, 
With a 
captivating roguish little belle, 
CHORUS. 
We first met in the Summer, 
Down by a 
running stream, 
And upon my sacred honor, 
It seems to be a 
dream. 
But I 
love her as you may suppose, 
She's one of sweet sixteen, 
And as pretty as the red, red rose, 
Is the roguish little beauty, Emaline. 
Now of all the pretty girls I 
know of, 
There's none so sweet and fair. 
For her eyes are like a 
bright sun-boatn, 
And a 
light brown is the color of her hair. 
I 
received a 
billet-doux this morning 
From one in love, I 
ween, 
Which has made we happy all day lona-, 
'rwas from the little beauty, Emaline! 
We first met, eba, 
In her note she said she wished to see me, 
If the weather it be fine, 
So, this night I'm going to meet my love, 
As I 
live in hopes to make this beauty mint,. 
She's the darling of my heart, and dearer 
Than all on earth beside, 
And my happiness will be complete, 
When I 
take this little beauty for my bride. 
We first met, etc.

She's here and then she's there, 
She conies but will not stay,

I 
find she's far away. 
First she'll please me, 
Then she'll tease me, 
Then she'll say some loving word, ' 
Singing, smiling— winning, wiling, 
Flitting here and there— 
My love is like a

All in the summer time 
When flowers are blooming gay, 
And merry birds do chime 
Their sweet notes all the day ; 
We wander through the dell, 
Or in the shady grove, 
And when my love I 
tell— 
She only laughs at love. 
First she'll please me, eta. 
My love is like a

For in the winter time 
Her voice is never heard 
About this chilly clime 
But to a

She flies' away to rest, 
Her home is in my heart, 
That's where she built her nest. 
First she'll please me, etc. 
FAIR ELLENORE.

M Y 
heart is light by day and night, 
With hope and love and joy in store, 
Since I 
have seen the lovely queen— 
The modest maiden, Ellenore. 
She's good and kind, and so refined, 
She has no fear the wide world o'er, 
Her sweetest smile is free of guile, 
A 
flower of love is Ellenore. 
CTIORITS. 
Sweet Ellenore, fair Ellenore, 
Thou hast my heart forever more, 
'Tis full of love pure from above, 
For thee, for thee, fair Ellenore! 
The joys of spring, the birds that sing! 
The woodbine twining round thy door, 
The sweet perfurne of flowers in bloom 
Are loves of thee which I 
adore; 
I'll ne'er forget when last we met, 
The kindly tear yonr eye tilled o'er; 
And mine were blind by feelings kind, 
The day we parted, Ellenore. 
Sweet Ellenore, etc. 
I 
hope and pray that come it may, 
The end of sorrow's weary chain, 
When I 
once more on native shore, 
May tread the dear paths o'er again; 
And may it come across the foam, 
The sweet news touching my heart's core, 
That Ellenore waits at the doer, 
• , 
meet me as in days before.

THE LILY OF THE VALLEY. 
Written and composed by -Wm. II. DELKHANTY. 
W ILL you take a 
little ramble in the country, 
It's only just a 
little way from town, 
To an ivy-covered cottage in the valley, 
Where dwells a 
lovely maiden of renown 
And she's the sweetest girl by far, 
That ever you did see, 
Amon ,' 
the other girls a 
star, 
She ever seems to be; 
And should you like to see this flow'r, 
Just take a 
walk with me, 
And from her little garden bower, 
I'm sure she'll smile on thee.

She's the lily of the valley, 
And the girl I 
intend to marry, 
But come and take a 
ramble in the country, 
'Tis where the scent of roses fill the air, 
It's there you'll see the lily of the valley, 
All in her golden beauty, fresh and fair ! 
Oh, if you could only see her in the morning, 
it's when she goes for water to the spring, 
And see the lovely smile her face adorning, 
Or hear the pretty song I 
heard her sing; 
You surely never could forget, 
And when in lonely hours— 
You'd think with joy of when you met 
My love among the flowers ; 
Then, if you envy me my lot, 
You cannot be to blame; 
For if some other won her heart, 
I 
know I'd feel the same. 
She's the lily, etc. 
Oh, lovely was the day when last T 
met her, 
And charming was the secret told to site, 
'Twas that she'd write me a 
letter, 
And place it in the hollow of a 
tree. 
That I 
should imitate her style 
She meekly did infer, 
While dim' her blush) there came a 
smile— 
With—leave one there for her, 
The one you love the best in life— 
Make a 
messenger of me, 
I'll soon have power to call her wife, 
Then I 
will happy be.

health and money, as their timely use will avert attacks 
of Bilious Fever and Ilia/aria/ Fever, and will so fortify

FE VER. 
Bewarc the first approaches of this stealthy foe, that cometh 
like a 
thief in the night. 
A change of drinking- water, unripe 
fruit, a 
debauch, a 
slight cold may be the first clutch of Fever. 
It can be guarded against and repelled by a 
timely use of 
Merlin's Health Granules. A person shou!d never 
travel to the mountains, to the sea- shore, or on the ocean with-
out a 
supply. 
Doctors admit this fact, and they don't speak 
well of any medicine unless its merits are very great. 
DYSPEPSIA, the arch-fiend of misery and decay, can 
be cured effectually by a 
persistent use of Mer;in's Health 
Granules. Why ? 
Because these Granules go to the 
very root of the complaint. 
They not only drive out the fecu-
lent matter that clogs the avenue's of the body, but they in-
vigorate and give tone to the digestive apparatus, and make 
healthful blood flow through every petty artery ; then comes 
a 
good appetite, and good food insures a 
lasting cure. 
In the Cholera Years it was found that the first 
thing needed was to drive out of the stomach and bowels the 
noxious germs of the destroyer. 
Nothing is so effectual for 
this purpose as Merlin's Healih Granules, for while 
they are very powerful for good they are harmless for evil. 
A child may take them in moderation, while they can be 
made to operate upon the strongest man. 
" 
I 
DON 'T 
KNOW WHAT AILS ME !" 
How often do we hear this remark. 
A man or woman grows 
weak, feeble, irresolute. 
As Hamlet says, " Man delights not 
toe, nor woman either." 
This feeling arises from many causes. 
Lack of exercise, loss of appetite, deep grief— all these tend to 
render the fluids of the body heavy, thick, sluggish. 
There 
was a 
health-lesson taught by the angel stirring the pool be-
fore the sick got any benefit from its waters. 
It needed action, 
vitalizing with pure air. 
This is precisely the effect produced 
by Merlin's Health Granules. The sluices are cleaned, 
and the nutriment finds its way where it is wanted and can du 
most good.

MALARIAL FEVER. 
However doctors may differ as to the exact cause of this 
fearful disease, they all agree upon one thing, that poisonous 
atoms have found their way into the system. 
Common sense 
tells us that the way to cure this disease is to expel these 
poisonous atoms. 
This is effectually done by a 
free use of 
Merlin's Health Granules. . Not only do they cleanse 
the bowels of the perilous stuff that to retain is fatal, but they 
restore the blood to activity, and make it pay frequent visits to 
the lungs, where it becomes aerated and full of health. This is 
purifying at the fountain head. 
Where the source is clean the 
stream cannot be foul. 
Good health and chills and fever of 
course cannot exist together. 
THE GOUT CAN BE BELIEVED., 
if not entirely banished from the system, by using Merlin's 
Health Granules at the first intimation of an approach-
ing attack. 
The Granules prevent the formation of the 
chalky deposits which, if allowed to become at all fixed, ren-
der the joints stiff, and make them work with difficulty. 
The 
Granules have exactly the same effect upon the jo:nts that 
grease has upon axles and wheels— lubricates the grating 
parts, then the joints work smooth and easy and without any 
pain. 
Try Merlin's Health Grantileii occasionally if 
you want to bid defiance to that old hereditary foe, the Gout. 
WAUEFULNESS AND SOMNAMBULISM, 
though so different in many of their features, are children of 
the same parents— Indigestion and Torpidity of Blood. 
Both 
of these complaints can be cured in the same way, simply by 
producing a 
healthy, natural digestion. 
It is no use trying 
local remedies. 
You may swathe and bathe and bandage the 
head till you are tired. 
It will not alter the condition of the 
blood. 
You might as well expect to make a 
house healthy by 
whitewashing the outside and cleaning the windows while the 
cellar was reeking with sewer gas. No ! the blood must be puri-
fied, or disease will ride rampant. 
Use Merilin's Health 
Granules and Wakefulness will subside into calm slumber, 
and the open-eyed sleep-walker will remain with his eyes closed 
upon the unruffled pillow.

NERVOUS DEMIL-ILT-E. 
is the curse of civilization. 
Luckily it can be cured. 
It pro-
ceeds from intense mental strain ; from violating physical laws, 
throwing the reins on the neck of Passion. The body becomes 
impaired, the mind follows suit, then the weak body and the 
irresolute mind plague each other, and drive the poor wretch 
to mental imbecility ; but, as we have said, Nervous DAllity 
can be cared; the diseased humors can be driven from the 
blood ; the stomach becomes strong and active, the heart 
bounds to its work, the mind follows suit, black despair flies, 
health returns, not by any miracle, but simply by using the 
great remedy, Merlin's Health Granules. One box 
has been known to bring a 
poor wretch from the edge of the 
grave. 
Do your bones ache 1 You are either filled with Malarial 
Poison or there lingers in your system the dire effects of an-
cestral indiscretions and the Mercurial Poisons never driven 
out. 
But do not despair. 
By judiciously using the never-
failing remedy, Merlin's Health Granules, the poison-
ous atoms are expelled to give place to pure, strength- giving 
blood. 
THE PRESENT DAY 
is the time to try and get well. 
The ounce of prevention is 
the thing. 
Don't wait till you have to get the pound of cure. 
Stop the first small leak. 
Don't wait till the ship is water-
logged.

"COME AND LET US REASON TOGETHER." 
It has been well said that he that cannot reason is a 
fool ; he 
that dare not reason is a 
slave; he that will not reason is a 
bigot. 
We do not believe, good reader, that you belong to either of 
these three classes, and therefore address ourselves to you. 
You will have noticed that every Doctor, after feeling the 
pulse, looking at the tongue, and ascertaining the temperature 
of the body, pauses for a 
moment's thought. 
Then he quickly 
asks, " Are your bowels regular? " 
This you will therefore 
notice is 
the very key-note by which he seeks to know 
whether you are healthy or diseased. 
By further questions in 
the same direction he learns the particular nature of the dis-
ease. 
But no odds how many different points he may wander 
to, he soon returns 10 the digestive organs. 
The disease may be most apparent in the lungs, the kidneys, 
the heart, the liver, the head; but it is always the bowels he 
treats as the salient point of disease that has to be first treated, 
hence the first medicine prescribed is a 
dose to act upon the 
organs of digestion. 
This is wisdom. 
The doctor knows that 
without thorough digestion half the food taken is 
worse than useless. 
As certain things strewn around become 
incorporated with the soil and nourish it (left in a 
compact 
heap they breed disease), so without an active digestion food is 
hurtful. 
These are truths that no sane man will attempt to 
gainsay. 
What is the remedy ? 
Surely a 
medicine powerful 
enough to carry off all injurious matter, and at the same time 
having such balsamic qualities as will heal any inflammations 
that may have arisen in the lining of the different ducts. 
Now 
the very best thing that can be used to do what all doctors 
recommend is Merlin's Health Granules. 
Pleasant 
to take, easy in operation, and leaving lasting good effects after 
their use. 
This is homely, sound doctrine. 
Try, and be con-
vinced. 
Merlin's Health Granules do not compete 
with any other aperient medicine; they simply extinguish 
them. 
The sun don't fight with a 
penny dip, it merely out-
shines it.
