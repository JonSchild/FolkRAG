Now as we lay off Monterey,The boys began to frisk-O!And some did swear, if wind was fair,We'd
soon be at Francisco.Drops large and small, in many a squall,And now and then a spray too,O'er
head and feet were sure to meetAnd that both night and day too.From various hands the pots
and pansDisperse in every quarter,Some salt junk eat, while others treat,And [md] never mind the
water.One thing we know, that we can show,And that too without boasting,We've all enough of this
'ere stuffCalled California coasting.And thus we talk and act, but then'Tis useless so to hanker,These
things we'll bear, 'till all is fair,And then run in and anchor.
