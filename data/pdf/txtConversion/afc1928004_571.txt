'Twits many years ago, 
Before the war that made me free, 
Dis ole man's heart was happy den, 
Yes, happy as could be. 
Ole massa he was good to me, 
De folks were all so kind, 
A. batter home I 
ne'er shall see, 
And kinder friends will never find. 
CHORUS. 
For I 
long to see the South once more, 
To walk among de sugar cane, 
Before de angel comes a 
knocking at de door, 
I 
long to see the South again. 
I 
wonder is ole Dinna dead, 
And where de children are; 
Have dey forgot dere poor old dad, 
Who wanders now from home so far. 
Perhaps dis ole man ne'er shall see 
De nigs he called his own; 
May be dat death has set dem free, 
And took dem to a 
shore unknown.

Down South in Dixey, Ruben, 
Dent was hopy times, 
For it's just before emancipation, 
Done destroyed onr Yankee nation, 
And we had to leave our sunny clime. 
Oh ! Ruben list to me, 
And so happy we will be, 
As around de ole plantation we do roam, 
And while we're here on earth, 
The dear place of our birth, 
Let us think of our dear old hapry home. 
Let us think of Roxanna, 
You children, Pete and Hanna, 
And de many good ole days of long ago, 
Let us offer up our praise, 
And our shouts of glory raise, 
Till old Gabriel on his trumpet he does blow.

Oh! my name is Paddy Carmer, 
From the county of Tralee; 
There's a 
little girl that wears spit curls, 
She's crazy gone on me. 
She sells butter-milk on Sundays, 
On the beach at Coney Isle; 
There's not a 
girl in all creation, 
Can compete with her for style. 
CHORUS. 
She's a 
darling, she's a 
dumpling, 
She's the divil on the mash; 
She's Mary Kelly's cousin, 
And her brother juggles hash. 
Her father grinds an organ, 
The old woman drives a 
dray, 
And Berdelia's on the making 
Mashes all the day. 
Oh! her hair is red, nangs down her head, 
Like the tail of an old dead mule; 
She speaks seventeen different languages, 
Though she never went to school. 
She sleeps out all night gets boiling tight, 
Ned Leary is her pard, 
And she sleeps upon a 
clothes line, 
That hangs out in our back yard.

Four little boys and girls all min,

But old massa went off to de war, 
Neber to come back again. 
And de children all were happy when 
We heard dat he was slain.

Four-leben-forty-four, 
So now I'se broke, I'se going back, 
To Alabam once more.

OLD POMPEY'S GETTING BAREFOOT 
ON THE TOP OF HIS HEAD 
BY T. D. C. MILLER. 
MUSIC BY JOS. SaFIWEISECIL 
Copyright issi by Mrs. Pauline Lkder. 
All rig ts reserved. 
The wool was growing longer and Pompey 
getting stronger, 
Before that morn of sunshine when rnassa set him free; 
He used to sing with pleasure, and play the 
songs we'd treasure, 
When we were all so happy before the jubilee. 
It breakdown and at party, old Pomp was 
hale and hearty, 
And none could dance so nicely, the colored 
maidens said; 
But time has brought him sadness, and gone 
is all his gladness, 
Old Pompey's gettin' barefoot on the top of his head I 
CHORUS. 
The wool no more is growing, and Pompey's 
heart is knowing, 
Those joys he fondly cherished in bygone days have fled; 
The past he will remember, tho' bleak is chill December, 
Old Pompey's getting barefoot on the top of his head. 
All day he worked for muse., and at night would 
court some lassie, 
Beneath magnolia blossoms that gleamed 80 fair 
and whites 
Or play the banjo sweetly, while darkies danc'd 
so fleetly, 
Whoa fell the southern moonbeans in floods 
of mellow light; 
But those fond ties are broken, and gone each 
tender token, 
That made his heart so happy, ere bliss of life had fled, 
Now days of joy are over, for maiden and for lover, 
Old Pompey's getting barefoot on the top of his head. 
The cabin too, is lonely, for cats and owls live only 
Where Pompey once was happy before they set him free; 
The honey-suckle clambers above his silent chambers, 
But no kind hand has trained them since 
dawned the jubilee. 
'Neath southern suns the brightest, old 
Pocnpey's heart beat lightest, 
And sweeter was the fragrance these blooming roses shed 
But now he wanders lonely N:ith dreams to 
cheer him only, 
old Pompey's gettin' barefoot m the top of his head.

Last winter was a 
hard one, Mrs. Reilv did you say, 
Well, ' tis myself that knows it, for its many's the day, 
Your husband wasn't the only man sat behind the wall, 
There's inv old man McGuiness didn t 
get no job at all. 
The pi)liticians promised him work on the Boulevard, 
o 
handle a 
pick and shovel and throw dirt on the cart. 
Ah! six months ago they promised him work he'd shortly get 
But believe me, my good woman, they are promising him yet. 
CHORUS 
Then cheer up, Mrs. Reily and cl 
n't give way to the blues, 
You and I 
will cut a 
shine, with new bonnets and new bhoest 
As for me I'm done crying, no more will I 
sigh or sob, 
I'll wait till times get better, when McGuinness gets a 
jab. 
The Italians, divil take them, why didn't they stay at home, 
Shure we had plenty of our own class to ate up all our own; 
They come out like beet,in summer time and sworn for to stay; 
The contractors they have hundreds for forty ctuts a 
day, 
They work upon the railroad they shovel snow and slush, 
But there's one thing in their favor, Italians they 
never do get lush, 
No, they always bring tie ir money home, taste no gin or win,. 
And that one thing I'd like to say of your old man and mine 
Chorus. 
Ali! the spring time now is coming we'll all have plenty wok 
McGruiness will go back to hie trade, shure he's a 
handsome clerk.

I

When de Link= sojers come,

And drives massa from his home.

On de lubly Ohio; 
And den ole massa heeled it, 
From de mighty Northern foe.

I 
lived in old Kentucky, 
When our massa ran away, 
And left his darkies lonely, 
On de mancipation day. 
I 
see de soldiers comin', 
And they told me I 
was free, 
I 
blessed the flag they carried, 
On that morn of jubilee. 
I 
felt a 
heap ob sadness, 
For old massa good and kind, 
Who ran away and left his 
Poor old darkeys all behind. 
Chorus. 
The times are getting shakey, 
And my poor old heart is sore; 
While in de cotton pickings, 
These old hands will work no more. 
When massa left me lonely, 
As de Linkum gunboats come, 
I 
moved from old Kentucky, 
But I 
find no place like home.

One day in the street, I 
just happened to meet, 
An old friend whom I'd not seen for years, 
The old man was sad tho' to meet me was glad, 
And his eyes as we spoke filled with tears. 
I 
said, John, be brief, what's the cause of your grief? 
To me your misfortunes unfold; 
Said he, in poor me, you a 
sample may see, 
Of how a 
man gets served when he's old. 
'CHORUS. 
Each day growing older, I 
get the cold shoulder, 
By youngsters thrust out in the cold, 
Who jeeringly say, that I'm in the way, 
That's how you get served when you're old. 
When young I 
was praised, and my wages was raised, 
No labor then I 
ever did shirk; 
And my master would then point me out to the men, 
As the one who best stuck to his work. 
Now I'm feeble and weak, he'll to me hardly speak, 
Unless it's to grumble or scold; 
They simply make fun of what I 
have done, 
That's how you get served when you'ae old. 
Chorus. 
My wife poor soul she is nearly seventy-three, 
How to keep her from want I 
don't know; 
If I 
beg, I 
intrude, and by police are pursued, 
' And if to the Commissioners of Charities we go, 
ETo seek for relief they but add to our grief, 
You must go to the Island we are told, 
'art husband from wife, to be paupers for life, 
at's how you get served when you're old.

It will break my heart in two, which I

And no other one so loving kind and true.

Then come to my arms, Norah darling, 
Bid your friends in dear Ireland good-bye; 
And its happy we will be in that dear land ot the free, 
Living happy with your Barney McCoy. 
I 
would go with you, Barney darling, 
But the reason why I 
told you oft before; 
It would break my poor mother's heart if 
from her I 
had to part, 
And go roaming with you, Barney McCoy. 
Then come to my arms, Ste. 
I 
am going far away, Norah darling, 
Just as sure as there's a 
God I 
adore; 
But remember what I 
say; that until the 
judgement day, 
You will never see your Barney McCoy. 
Then come to my arms, &c. 
I 
would go•with you, Barney darling, 
If my mother and the rest of them were there, 
For I 
know we wo..ld be blest in that dear land

Living happy with your Barney McCoy. 
Then come to my arms, &a 
I 
am going far away, Norah Darling, 
And the ship is now anchored in the bay, 
And before to-morrow you will hear the signal gun, 
So be ready, it will carry us away.

This day one year ago. 
tender bud so beautiful,

My precious darling lay;

My little one away. 
As cold and ligid in my arms, 
His lifeless form was placed, 
Such agony of soul then felt, 
Can never be effaced.

Oh! love it is such a 
very funny thing, 
It catches the young and the old, 
It's just like a 
plate of boarding-house hash, 
For many's the man's been sold. 
It will make you feel like a 
fresh-water eel, 
It will cause your heart for to swell, 
You may love your wife as you do your life, 
But 'twill empty your pocket-book as well. 
So boys, keep away from the girls, I 
say, 
And give them plenty of room, 
You will find when you're wed, they'll bang 
you till you're dead, 
With the bawld-headed end of a 
broom. 
When a 
man's in love with a 
pretty little girl, 
He talks as gentle as a 
dove, 
Ile calls her his honey, and he spends lots of money, 
For to show her he's solid in love. 
When his money's all gone, and his clothes up 
the spout, 
He will find the old saying true, 
That a 
bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, 
What the deuce is a 
fellow going to do. 
With a 
wife and fourteen half-starved kids, 
And tell you it ain't no fun, 
When the butcher comes around to collect his bills, 
With a 
dog and a 
double barrelled gun. 
So boys, keep away from the girls, I 
say, 
And give them plenty of room, 
You'll think you are in clover, till the honey-
moon is oyer, 
And then you will wish you were dead. 
With a 
cross-eyed baby on each knee, 
With a 
wife with a 
wart on her nose, 
You will find that love don't run so smooth, 
When you have to wear your second-hand clothes, 
When the rents are high the kids will cry, 
Kase they ain't got nothing for to chaw, 
You'll holler for your son to load up the gun, 
For to vaccinate your mother-in-law.

AN OLD MAN SONG. 
IS SUNG BY FRANK LINEL 
I 
have just come out to see you, and tell you who I 
am; 
I 
am growing old and feeble, you can see; 
My name is Reuben Johnson, I 
came from old Caroline, 
Where the sugar cane is sweet as sweet can be, 
Since the war things they have changed—that 
you know as well as me, 
But I 
thought I'd let you know it in my song— 
And my good old wife and I 
am located in this town; 
I'm selling kindling-wood to get along. 
CHORUS. 
If you want to help the old man, just buy a 
load of wood— 
try my best to please you in my song; 
Just buy a 
load and try, you will find it am dry— 
I'm selling kindling wood to get along. 
They passed the civil rights bill to try and heal 
the wounds 
That caused this poor old man's hair to turn gray, 
When they took him from his home, where 
he used to love to roam, 
With old massa, in the cotton fields to stray. 
Yes, I'd rather love to be down in the good old south, 
Where all the darkies do belong. 
For I 
was better off by far, down there before the war, 
Than selling kindling wood to get along. 
Chorus. 
The time it soon will come when you no longer hear, 
The voice of poor old Reuben Johnson cry: 
Though I 
may pass away, you will think of me 
some day— 
Then I'll be a 
colored angel in the sky. 
I_know the blessed Lord won't no objections make, 
To a 
black man as long as he does right; 
For when I 
goes into dat land, and joins His holy band, 
I 
kiaow right well He's gwilae to turn me white. 
Chorus.

TIRM2 is McNamara. I 
came from County Clare, 
In the 
arling little isle across the sea ; 
Where the mountains and the hills, the lakes and 
ripplirg rag 
Are :. inging sweetest music all the day. 
Our little hum was swan, it would not support us all, 
So one of us was forced away from home ;  
r. bid them all good-bye, with a 
t,ar-drop in my eye. 
And I 
sailed for Castle Garden all alone.

When I 
landed in New Vcrk, I 
tried hard to get work 
And I 
traveled I

I 
went from place to place, with starvation in my face, 
But every place they want no help, they say.

Ther'es a 
dear spot of land far out on the oeean, 
The prettiest island that ever was seen; 
There's no place on earth that sc well suits 
my notion, 
It's the Emerald isle where the shamrock is green, 
Alas ! the bold tyrant has taken possession. 
And driven our daughters and sons to exile, 
For no one could stand their tyranic aggression. 
And banished are we from the Emerald Isle. 
CHORUS. 
Then its God speed the day that will dawn with 
our freedom, 
When the stars and the harp shall be blended as one, 
Then the poor of ould Ireland will need no help 
to feed them, 
They'll belong to the country of brave Washington. 
When I 
left my dear home my poor heart was 
breaking, 
Oh ! tis a 
sad moment the parting of friends, 
The tear-be-dimed eyes, and. the honest 
hand-shaking, 
Oh ! that causes the stoutest of hearts to unbend, 
But t1;.ere are occasions when partings a 
pleasure, 
And one is in crossing the beautiful sea; 
Where toil is rewarded by friendship and treasure, 
In the home of the brave and the land of the free.

SOMEBODY'S MOTHER. 
RECITED BY GCS WILLIAMS. 
The woman was old and raged and gray, 
And bent with the chill of a 
winter's day; 
The streets were white with recent snow, 
And the woman's feet were aged and slow. 
At the crowded crossing she waited long, 
Jostled aside by the careless throng 
Of human beings who passed her by, 
Unheeding the glance of her anxious eye. 
Down the street with laughter and shout, 
Glad in the freedom of ' school let out," 
Come happy boys, like a 
flock of sheep, 
flailing the snow piled white and deep, 
Past the woman so old and gray, 
Hastened the children on their way. 
None offered a 
helping hand to her, 
So weak and timid afraid to stir, 
Lest the carriage wheels or the horses feet 
Should trample her down in the slippery stred. 
At last came out of the merry troop, 
The gayest boy of all the group; 
He paused beside her, and whispered low, 
" 
I'll help you across if you wish to go ?" 
Her aged hand on his strong young arm 
She placed, and so without hurt or harm, 
He guided the trembling feet along, 
Proud that his own were young and strong; 
Then back again to his friends he went, 
His young heart happy and well content, 
" 
She's somebody's mother, boys, you know, 
For all she's aged, and poor and slow; 
And someone, sometime, may lend a 
hand 
To help my mother—you understand 1 
If ever she's poor and old and gray, 
And her own dear boy is far away." 
" 
Somebody's mother." bowed low her head, 
In her home that night, and the prayer she an14, 
Was; " God be kind to that noble boy, 
Who is somebody's son and pride and joy." 
Faint was the voice, and worn and weak, 
But Heaven lists when its chosen speak; 
Angels caught the faltering word, 
And " Somebody's mother's" prayer was kw&

In Scotland's fair lands o'er mountains and rills. 
That's where I 
roamed for many a 
day. 
looking at the lads and lassies on the green ; 
In the fair old land of scotland far away. 
I 
have waited for her coining, but she hasn't come as psi; 
I 
he until seems to dawn upon me plain— 
They say she is false, but I 
still believe lr r 
true, 
She's my darling blue-eyed Scotch Lassie Jean. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! Jean, my bonnie Jean, come to your laddie 
once again! 
They say you were false, but I 
still believe you mine, 
You are my bonnie blue-eyed Scotch lassie Jean. 
She said you would meet me, hut I've waited long in vain—. 
In lands far away she does roam ; 
her promise she will keep— oh ! break it not my Jean 
We'll be happy in our bonnie little home. 
Oh ! then let Die long not wait, let me meet the 
soon, my Jess. 
And the ileaveils will smile on our love 
And when life is dead, we will leave this earthly scene, 
And our hearts will dwell in joy and bliss above. 
Chorusl 
CORRECT EDITION. 
Let cowardly slanderers say what they will, 
Against the dear land of my birth, 
But I 
will maintain she always will be, 
The grandest old spot on the earth. 
Some say with a 
sneer, we are cowards at heart, 
Fit for nothing but drinking potheen, 
But I 
throw back the villainous lie in their teeth, 
They're as brave as the shamrock is green. 
CHORUS. 
Pat he may be foolish and very often wrong, 
Pat's got a 
temper that don't last very long, 
Pat is fond of jollity, as everybody knows, 
There never was a 
coward where the shamrock grow0. 
If ever he weeps at the voice of distress, 
Don't blame him, his heart is too warm, 
His family over the ocean, perhaps, 
Must weather black poverty's storm. 
Don't sneer at his sorrows, or laugh at his tears, 
Assist, at least, if you can, 
Remember that Pat on many a 
field, 
Has proved that he is a 
true man. 
Chorus. 
Rermtmber the Celts and the Saxons are bound, 
By the ties of pure brotherly love; 
Come test him again, and you'll find him as tr ue 
As the stars in the heavens above. 
And always give honor where honor is due, 
Let hands join.'d in friendship be seen, 
For he who despises a 
man for his name, 
Is not fit for a 
country or queen. — 
Chorus, 
BRIGHT EMERALD ISLE OF THE SEAN 
Erin, dear Erin, no Isle so enchanting, 
Was ever yet seen in the frame of the sea; 
A 
bright emerald gem in which nothing is wanting, 
To show what a 
jewel of earth ought to be. 
Wherever we wander thy memory we cherish, 
Whene'er from our vision thy shores may depart, 
There is not a 
tint of thy verdure can perish, 
So deeply each hue is engraved in our heart. 
Oh ? Erin, dear Erin, a'midst gladness and sorrow, 
For thee have we mingled the smile and the tear. 
When darkest the night, we have known 
that the morrow, 
With rays that were brightest was sure to be near. 
Thy welfare. dear Erin, forever we'll cherish, 
Tho' absent from thee, thou'rt dear to the heart, 
There is not a 
tint of thy verdure can perish, 
So deeply each hue is engraved in our hearts.

Give me back my dear old home that I 
used to love so welt, 
In the dear old sunny south so far away, 
Where the breeze is softly sighing thro' the trees every night, 
And the mocking- bird sings sweet the livelong day. 
Take inc back, oh! take me back to that old familiar spot, 
And thro' the cotton fields, oh! let Inc roam; 
For, I'm old and feeble and before I 
leave this land, 
Let me see once more my dear old Southern home.

When at nig-ht we would play the old banjo; 
I 
was a

But the days tho' short they seem, are lung ago. 
I've traveled the wide world o'er and in distant lands

PEBBLES IN THE SEA, 
BY ANNIE HERMIT. 
RECITED BY ADA BURNETT. 
COPYRIGHT 1881, BY MRS. PAULINE LIEDER. 
Who shall judge a 
man from nature, 
Who shall know him by his dress; 
Paupers may be fit for princes, 
Princes fit for something less. 
Crumpled shirt, and dirty jacket, 
May beclothe both you and me, 
So with your lot try be contented, 
As the Pebbles in the sea. 
There are springs of crystal nectar, 
Ever swelling out of stone, 
There are purple buds and golden, 
Hidden, crushed, and overgrown; 
God who counts by souls, not dresses, 
Loves and prospers you and me; 
While He values thrones the highest, 
But as Pebbles in the sea. 
There are foam embroidered oceans, 
There are little weed clad rills, 
There are feeble inch high saplings, 
There are cedars on the hills. 
God who counts by souls, not stations, 
Loves and prospers you and me, 
For to Him all vain distinctions 
Are as Pebbles in the sea. 
Truth and justice, are eternal, 
Born with loveliness and light; 
Secret wrong shall never prosper, 
While there is a 
starry night. 
God whose world-heard voice is singing, 
Boundless love to you and me, 
sinks oppression with its titles, 
As the Pebbles in the sea,

I 
used to run on de ribber, 
In de year of seventy-three, 
And sawed wood for de kitchen 
Of de steamer Robert Lee. 
Some figs war tapping whiskey 
On de quiet whar I 
stood, 
And when I 
told, de cook remarked; 
" 
Jest you keep a-sawing wood." 
CHORUS. 
Oh! ba'r it in mind, 
It's a 
motto you'll find, 
'Twill sarve you a 
deal of good; 
For when you -see a 
man 
Spill anoder man's can, 
"Jest you keep a-sawing wood." 
Well, gemmen, dat's de wisest t'ing 
flat ebber was said to me, 
For I 
was soon promoted by 
De cap'n of de Robert Lee. 
be roustabouts got to like me, 
And helped me when dey could; 
For, no matter what dem niggers did, 
" 
I 
jest kept a-sawing wood." 
Oh I 
tattling is an awful thing, 
And scandal's a 
heap sight worse; 
Jest see how folks get all broke up 
By its biting venomous curse. 
When I 
hear de sarpint coming round, 
To scandal and intrude, 
I 
jest clap both hands to my ears, 
And go on a-sawing wood.

No doubt you've heard of stolen kisses, 
But that is not of what I 
sing, 
And if you give me your bright glances, 
I'll show 'tis not the pigeon wing. 
My song is of a 
lovely littl,) maiden, 
A 
charming captivating little miss; 
And the first thing that I 
noticed, 
Was her pretty little rosy lips. 
CHORUS. 
She is the sweetest flower, (Break.) 
I 
could see her every hour, (Break.) 
When first I 
did beheld her, ( Break.) 
She caught ray heart right from the start, 
With her pretty little rosy lips. 
I 
often meet this little maiden, 
While strolling down beside the sea; 
And soon I'll ask her if she'll haee me 
And then so happy I 
will be. 
So now adieu, for soon I 
Taust be leaving, 
I 
never shall forget this hour -of bliss, 
And whene'er you kiss your sweetheart, 
Think of pretty little rosy lips.

There's a 
happy little cot down in southern Tennessee, 
Where the ivy blossoms twine round the door, 
And forever fresh and green in my memory it will be, 
Enough I 
know I'll never see it any more; 
But I 
never can forget the old home I 
love so well, 
And the many good old tunes that I 
have sung, 
And the tears they fill my eyes every time I 
try to tell 
Of the times I 
used to have when I 
was young.

And the times I 
used to have when I 
was young. 
When the autumn days had come, I 
would 
husk the yellow corn, 
In the fields I 
was singing all the day, 
And before they made me free I 
had never cause 
to mourn; 
And around the old place everything was gay; 
And many and many a 
time when the work of 
day was over, 
With my melody the old plantation rung, 
And my heart does often long for the happy 
days of yore, 
And the times I

It's of a 
social party that I 
will sing to yen, 
They're going for to give a 
fancy ball; 
Sure we got invitations and of course we must attend, 
'Twill be held down here Swallerholla 
There'll be singing there'll be dancing, and 
all such lots of fun. 
When the music's playing sweetly in the hall; 
The O'Leary's, O'Cleary's, O'Brien's and Donohoe's 
Will be spoiling at McCarthy's Fancy Ball. 
CHORUS. 
We waltzed away to music so gay, 
Up and down the hall, 
With great delight, we danced all night, 
At McCarthy's Fancy Ball. 
When they play a 
polka. a 
schottische, or a 
waltz, 
Then you take your girl out for to dance; 
Come on, Mary Grogan, let us have some fun, 
Enjoy yourself now while you got the chance, 
All the servant girls, sure, they'll be there, 
Dressed in their clothes so fine, 
With money that they saved up all the fall, 
Arrah won't they spend it freely we'll have 
a 
jolly time, 
When we're down at McCarthy's Fancy Ball. 
When the ball is over and you are going home, 
With your little darling by your side, 
It's a 
Mary, Kate, or Nellie that you are waltzing 
with, 
Hoping some day that she will be your bride, 
It's then you pop the question of course she 
answers yes, 
And tells you not to mention it at all. 
'You go home quite light-hearted and blessing 
the night, 
That you were at McCarthy's Ball.

I 
am thinking of the day when but a 
little child, 
I 
wandered o'er the meadows to the hill, 
Where the sweet flowers grew, and forever 
growing wild, 
And the stream e'er flowed by the mill. 
But the old mill house has gone to decay, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
And the miller he lies sleeping where the 
gentle breezes blow 
And we played ' neath the turnpike gate. 
CHORUS. 
' 
For the turnpike gate is the pride of ray heart, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
When she sits beside me now, there's a 
smile 
upon her brow, 
That reminds me of the turnpike gate. 
And the old school house has gone to decay, 
Where the schoolmaster heard us recite, 
And those happy, happy days have faded 
from our view, 
When our little hearts were filled with delight 
And when school was out we would wander to 
the spring, 
Where I 
drew for you pictures on your slate; 
And those happy childhood days they'll come 
again no more, 
When we played on the turnpike gate.

We're both growing aged together, 
And Jennie has left the old farm ; 
To walk by the side of another, 
As on in life's journey they roam, 
And John who was tender and loving, 
Has gone in the pathwhy to harm: 
And lefi his old parents in sorrow, 
To suffer or mortg:iv;e the : arm. 
CHORW5. 
It's sad to be axed and feeble, 
And know that this life has no charms, 
But when in old age we are childless, 
How painful to mortgage the farm, 
But when in old age we are childles
s. 
how painful to mortgage the farm. 
We thought dohn would he our protection, 
For he waq so kind when a 
boy ; 
And Betsey so gentle aid loving. 
Would call him a mother's fond joy. 
But he was led off by companions. 
In ways that bring evil and harm ; 
And left Iris old parents in sorrow. 
To suffer or mortgage the farm. 
It's hard to he luveless and childless, 
When wrinkles are deep on the brow; 
And hair has grown aged arid whitened, 
With footsteps so tottering now. 
But when we are feeble and helpless, 
t% it Ii none to protect us from harm 
We only can suffer in silence. 
Or tearfully mortgage the farm.
