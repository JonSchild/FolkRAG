JACK O' DIAMONDS
Jack o' Diamonds, Jack o' Diamonds is a hard card to play; You can play it in the summer,
play it in the fall; But Jack o' Diamonds was the poor man's friend. I plays the deuce 'gainst
the tres, 'Cause the deuce has been winnin' all the day. My pardner, Low, plays the Jack
'gainst the fo', He'll win that bet in the dough.
I begged my pardner, Low, don't gamble no mo', 'Cause he would win that bet right in the
dough. Yes, Mother, I know you told me so; Don't play dice an' cards any mo'. I received a
letter which you reckon it said, That my pardner, was Low, was dead. I though I heared the
big bell tone; I knowed by that my pardner, Low, was dead an' gone.
