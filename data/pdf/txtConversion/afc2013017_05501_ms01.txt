Robert Wiesner: Interview Index 
00:00:02 
July 20, 2014. Mark Wagler talking with Bob Wiesner. Ethnic background is Irish and 
German. B.S. in Education in 1990 or ‘91. Masters in Curriculum and Instruction, around 2002. 
B.S. is through University of Wisconsin, and the Masters through National Lewis University. Bob 
first substitute-taught in Madison for two years, starting in 1991. Then spent 18 years at John 
Muir in Madison, where he taught 2-3, 3-4, 4-5 levels (between 2nd and 5th grades). Then 
taught one year at Hawthorne Elementary in Madison, then took a year’s leave, and now is going 
back to Hawthorne. During leave, he taught a year in Brazil, 3rd grade. 
00:02:50  
Bob did not intend to be a teacher. When he went to college, he majored in 
Anthropology which he really enjoyed. As he neared the end of that major, he began to think “now 
what?” As much as he enjoyed Anthropology, he didn’t want to pursue a post-graduate degree and 
wasn’t aware of a lot of anthropology-related jobs at the time, so began to look into teaching, 
thinking high school social studies. Found that no matter what he wanted to do, it would be the 
same amount of time, and knew that he had always enjoyed being with kids; even when he was 
young, he liked playing with younger kids because he enjoyed the way they were. So, he thought, if 
I am going to be teaching, I may as well be with people I like to be around, so started in elementary 
education. His earlier experience was with neighbor kids; he babysat. He also always entertained 
his younger sister and her friends. In middle school, he made his money through babysitting. 
00:05:00  
A typical day at work for Bob has changed over time. As the years have gone on, there 
has been a harder push to impose a daily routine, that wouldn’t have been of Bob’s choosing. But in 
general, day-to-day, he likes a pretty relaxed start. He never really went in with a firm idea of what 
was going to happen. He would have things up on the board, as far as a schedule goes, but they were 
just suggestions. He thinks some kids liked to see that, but especially early in his teaching, the match 
between the day and what was on the board was probably 50-50. He thinks that he would have 
some things that were kind of traditional; they would have math time, which would be separate from 
everything else. And at least at the beginning of the year, he would have specific things up there, 
such as ways to get questions going about specific topics—scientific questions, reading questions—
they started with a lot of that. Then, as things started to get rolling, if they had a class project or 
individual projects, Bob would just name the project they were working on.  
Especially early on, there was always something to do with an outside or environmental thing, so he 
would have “Pond” up on the board, or “Living Machine.” What they actually did with that would 
change from day to day. He did a lot of Read Aloud, always a half hour at least when Bob would read 
out loud, usually following lunch, sometimes it would stretch into an hour or more if they were really 
into it. The routine was: come in, look at the day, they always had some kind of talking about how 
the kids were, then moving toward them being more in charge of what they were doing within 
certain parameters. 
00:08:00 
The rhythm of the year: how does it change during the year? The beginning of the year 
has always been, to get the point across that the purpose they have in being together is to figure

out things that they were curious about. It takes a long time, especially up in 4th and 5th grade— 
because kids come in with the expectation of being told what to do—there is a certain amount of 
time it takes to convince kids that Bob is actually open to doing something they might find 
interesting. “So there is a lot of, I guess, it seems to be boring time. I have to wait a long time before 
kids buy in. And I’ve had to do very different things, depending on what kids I have, how old they are 
and who they are in particular, to kind of get a community going, where somebody has to take the 
lead as one of the students to actually light a fire, and then I hope to kind of build something out of 
it. So I depend on the kids a lot, to create that environment.”  
It took a while to figure this out, but one of the things that helps the kids build the environment is 
for Bob to do something himself, something he is interested in, or something to refer to at least, to 
tell the kids what he is figuring out, something he is curious about. “Even simple things in the 
classroom: ‘I’m wondering how this will work. Let’s try this, and let’s pay close attention’ to just kind 
of get that idea that this is a place where we try things, we do things; if they don’t work, we do 
something else. And we look closely, we don’t stick with something just because we thought it 
would work. If it doesn’t work, we change it. And I think that’s kind of a model for just about any 
kind of learning you can think of that matters. And, depending on the group, some kids have taken 
off with it and I can very quickly have them—I can ask them, ‘what are you really into, what are you 
curious about, what would you like to learn about’ and they can kind of pick up and move on, and 
I’ve been able to just follow along and help them out. But other times I’ve had to carry more of the 
load, and as the year goes on, it seems sometimes like maybe I’m leaving kids behind, maybe they’re 
not parti—they prefer to check out and watch—it’s always a dilemma. 
Ideally, as kids have kind of realized that I’m willing to support something that they want to do, 
they do more and more on their own, and I do less and less, with the idea that early, for the first 
half of my career, there was a model in place to support that—the Heron Network…” 
00:11:50  
The idea of the Heron Network was that it was inquiry based—it was asking questions, 
identifying interests, addressing real problems and trying to figure out an answer. Bob would model 
that, sometimes with the class project and sometimes on his own. As the year went on, there was 
sharing of the project with kids in the room but also with other classrooms, working with other 
teachers, with a lot of support from other people, community support, people that were connected 
to the network. They went to different places, they got outside, went to natural places close to the 
schools, and then the classrooms would meet together in conferences, with the idea that eventually 
they all would share the results from their work, at the end of the year publishing a journal.  
The journal started out as “I Wonder” and “It Figures” for science and math, and then eventually 
became “Great Blue” which was all encompassing. That whole framework gave Bob something to 
talk about with the kids, so as the year went on they knew what to expect, and they had a reason, 
they had an audience, a model from past years to show what this was all about, and then as the year 
progressed, at the end of the year it was ‘Let’s look back on our work, let’s write it up, let’s share it 
and let’s celebrate what we’ve been able to achieve.’ 
00:14:00 
What has changed over the years? The thing that Bob enjoys most about teaching 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017 
2
really hasn’t changed; “It has to do with learning but it’s deeper than that. It’s the relationship that 
you can build with kids, who I think are typically more open, more curious, I think funnier—humor 
is a huge part of it for me. I think it’s the honesty and the quality of the relationships is really what 
it’s been about for me. What I would change now would be, I would like to be supported in that, 
primarily. Because I really honestly believe that that’s more important than any of the academics. I 
think kids—I mean, I’m not saying they don’t need to learn any of the skills that we look at closely 
now, but I think they learn those better and they come out—I think they have a chance to be really 
different people if they are allowed to connect on a human level.” 
00:15:50  
The ideas that Mark Wagler and others were kicking around when Bob got started 
were hugely influential in his teaching. He was leaning toward ‘let kids be kids, let them be involved 
in things that matter’ and had a certain amount of disdain toward the textbook mentality, so 
working with the Heron Network by far was the most influential effect on Bob’s teaching. It 
confirmed a lot of what he believed about learning, but it provided a framework that Bob would 
have been struggling without. He is not someone who puts a lot of forethought into structure before 
things happen. He is more in the moment, ‘let’s see where this goes,’ thriving on chaos. While that 
works in some situations, year in and year out, with 20 kids in the room, it helps to have something 
in place that gives a structure and makes it possible to talk with kids and work with other people. 
00:18:15  
Bob looks at a rigidly structured classroom as a poor representation of the world in 
general. If you want kids to function in the world, you ought to let the world be part of the picture. 
Things happen in the world that are unpredictable; discoveries are made, events take place, 
patterns emerge, that don’t need to be created or managed. They present themselves as they are, 
and really, to learn, is to make sense of what is happening. “The more you narrow the focus on 
what you want kids to pay attention to and learn about, I think it actually harms them more than 
helps them.” They get certain notions that become very common. “Kids get the idea that learning is 
a matter of guessing the answer. They want to know when they’re finished with their learning. They 
want to know ‘am I good enough, am I not good enough.’ They depend someone else’s evaluation 
of not just whether they know enough but actually they start to lean on other people to decide if 
they are a worthy human being. And I think that’s where the harm comes in.” [Bob chokes up.]  
Mark: “This is stuff that is really important to you.” Bob: “It is, and it’s been hard to see it fade.” 
00:20:35  
What is causing it to fade? “Expectations about the job. A general consensus that we 
can measure how kids are doing, and we can see that they are failing—is always the message— and 
they are getting it.” Bob thinks the thrust of this is coming from a capitalist system that wants 
people to fulfill certain roles, and there is a general buy-in from people who have filled those roles. 
As much as it has been a good thing to gather and analyze data, Bob doesn’t think we have ever had 
the conversation about what we want kids to get out of school.  
He thinks there is a huge disconnect between people who generally know something about kids and 
how they grow up, and people who just want to show good results. If you have people in 
government who can make the decisions about how and to what extent things will be taught, that 
makes a big difference. There’s pressure from the top, and pressure on principals, and eventuall y it 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017

becomes pressure on teachers in the classroom to produce certain results that Bob doesn’t buy 
into. 
00:23:25  
How has the real world impacted Bob’s classroom? The easiest metaphor for Bob is the 
natural environment, because you could study it forever and not know everything about it; that’s 
just something you have to accept from the start. Bob doesn’t think kids get that message very often. 
You can identify and classify and look more and more closely at the tiny bits of everything, and what 
you learn from all that, if you do it enough, is it’s huge, it’s wonderful, there will always be a mystery 
because we aren’t ever going to figure everything out. “There was a pond, which is about two miles 
down the road, which is an unthinkable hike now to many teachers, but we would go there regularly. 
And it wasn’t that wild, it was an urban pond, but it had some wetland leading up to it; it had birds, 
trees, migrating birds, it had stuff living in the water. And we went—I don’t think we even really had 
much of a question—we went to look at this place, ‘let’s explore it.’ What lives there, how do they 
live, what’s going to happen from time to time and over the seasons.  
And really, the easiest way to start was just to dip a bucket of water into the pond, bring it back and 
start looking at it with scopes and magnifying glasses, and most kids had no idea that it’s teeming 
with life, even just the bucket of water that you thought was dirty muddy pond water is actually 
thousands of living things….” First, they thought they saw baby frogs, then they started to recognize 
that there were different things, and maybe those things eat these things. With books and 
information, they began to put together how everything in the pond lives. Very shortly, Bob’s room 
became designed to work that way. At Edgewood College, they had something that was designed by 
someone from Massachusetts, the Living Machine, which put nature to work to purify or clean 
human-used water.  
It was a different idea in Bob’s class, they used the idea to model the different parts of a wetland 
with different tanks, bathtubs, containers, with different plants, cycling through it. Seeing where 
things lived, how they lived, what survived and what didn’t. So they didn’t have to go to the pond 
every day for kids to figure out what was happening. They had cat tails growing in the room, 
minnows, crayfish, different animals [sound of camera throughout] that they had found. At one 
point, they had bullheads kids had caught, swimming around in the bathtub. Grew tomatoes in a 
bucket of gravel that that marsh water was flowing through. So they called that the Living Machine 
and that was their science time, because that was how they learned about an ecosystem, which 
allowed them to start looking at other places, like a woods down the road, a lawn that was part of 
the playground, asking the same questions: what depends on what, how do these things live, what 
do they eat, what works, what doesn’t work, why do they disappear; all these questions that happen. 
00:28:50  
Did Bob use this kind of methodology to study the cultural world with his students? 
Eventually, yes. [sound of camera throughout] Bob was lucky enough to work in classrooms every 
year that were essentially international. He always had kids from several different places, there were 
always several different languages, and so the class could ask questions about how families live, and 
the answers could be found at home, just by observing and asking questions of parents, 
grandparents, uncles or just saying what you know about your family. That gets much more to the 
human side of things.

Bob was always interested in having families participate in the classroom; the first couple of years, he 
had one kid a week be the VIP, and their families were invited on the Friday of their VIP week to 
answer questions. For the Kid-to-Kid section of the Great Blue Journal, the cultural section, the next 
part of the inquiry projects was to look at culture. Bob doesn’t remember exactly when that started, 
maybe the third or fourth year in. But it allowed kids to talk about what made them and their 
families unique, or what was special to them. And gave the whole class a way to talk about 
differences that were attached to real people. It led to a lot of conversations about whatever one 
assumes to be normal, which is what Bob’s anthropology training was, trying to get away from 
hierarchical thinking and ethnocentric thinking, that allow people to brush others aside, which Bob 
thinks is the tendency. 
00:32:00  
Bob’s colleagues cover a huge range. The people he has felt effective with have been 
curious, adventurous, challenging to each other, struggling to set limits on where the teaching stops 
and where does the rest of life continue. There is another camp—there are many camps, but Bob is 
trying to simplify things—where it’s ‘tell me what to do and I’ll do it so I can do a good job.’ So Bob 
had to look outside his school building to find enough people who were like- minded, that’s why the 
Heron Network was so important. He tried to involve some people from his own school, with some 
success, to pursue something off the beaten path.  
Early in his career, there was curiosity if not commitment to those kinds of things. With a lot of 
pressure, a lot of begging, pleading and digging, they got enough support from administrators and 
people outside the school community to make things work. That has changed. Almost all professional 
development comes top down now. Someone looks at numbers and decides what will make the 
numbers better, and there is rarely a choice. The attitude is not exciting. “The challenge is more 
avoiding failure than it is to pursue something that could be described as passionate. So I guess the 
professional atmosphere has changed a lot. There are still people who can find a way, and I’m hoping 
to remain one of them, to kind of do things in a way that are humane and actually beneficial, but I 
don’t think—again, professionally, I don’t think teachers are often now asked ‘do you think this is 
worthwhile?’ But that is the question that we started with, early on.” 
00:36:00 
Culture of the adults within the school building? Most days in the teachers’ lounge, an 
awful lot of complaints are heard. Sometimes it was, ‘this child is getting in the way of my teaching 
day.’ In the lounge, where wasn’t a lot of advice, ‘have you tried this’—it was very much ‘let’s have 
our regular complaint session. Let’s complain about the kids, what I’m expected to do, how I don’t 
have any time.’  
There were some exceptions. If Bob wanted to have conversations about moving in a positive 
direction, there were people he would visit in their rooms. That happened a lot, whether there were 
kids hanging out in the rooms or not. There were clusters, cliques—those who were in, those who 
were out, those who removed themselves completely. Not very kind, at times. Things got personal. 
Bob’s impression is that there is a difficulty talking about ideas without being personally attached to 
the ideas, that someone with different ideas is a threat to someone’s personhood. Sometimes Bob 
gets sucked into that, and he always feels rotten when that happens. He tries to find one or two 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017 
5
people—his own clique.  
 
Sometimes he or other people who have talked to him have explicitly said that they are not going to 
talk that way. You have to actually have that conversation; we’re not going to sit and complain about 
this person or that person. Professionally, the culture has not been one of trust. And that becomes 
magnified as demands are ratcheted up. 
 
00:41:00  
Bob remembers early in his career that he and his colleagues found ways to laugh and 
have fun. They had end-of-year parties, joke award ceremonies, poked fun sometimes in a challenging 
way. There was a general sense that they were in it together, despite differences in how they were in 
it. As time passed—Bob was 18 years in the same building—it became less that way, it didn’t even feel 
like a group. Meetings were contentious. 
 
There seemed to be more and more ‘I spend my time in my classroom, and anything that takes me 
out of my classroom, I resent it.’ There were far less social interactions outside of school. There was a 
time when it wasn’t uncommon to find 6-12 teachers at a bar on a Friday afternoon, talking and 
laughing, kind of doing reflection. That’s deteriorating. “I think it has become more of a chore to 
teach. I think it’s—there’s less to talk about. Because you’re not trying. I can’t speak for everyone, but 
I think there’s less innovation, there’s less coming from teachers, there’s much more directive kind of 
thing.  
 
So if people get together, they find themselves talking about all the things that they don’t enjoy, and 
who wants to do that?” People tend to have a stricter division between ‘this is my job, and this is the 
rest of my life.’ So when people leave work, they are done with work. Bob does more of that now; of 
course, he has a family now so has other demands. But part of it is, it’s not as rewarding or fulfilling, 
not as open, he doesn’t have as much input, so he leaves it at work. He can still kind of tell, if he is 
out in a restaurant and hears someone talking, he can tell if that is a teacher. “So there is something 
about how teachers behave that can be identified.” They talk louder in groups. They tend to mock 
kids’ voices, not necessarily in a hurtful way, imitate is a better word.  
 
This morning, Bob heard three mothers talking and one talked about the 4-K program in a certain 
way and he thought ‘she sounds like an insider’ and sure enough, she started complaining about her 
class size. So, something about teachers’ behavior identifies them. But they only interact within their 
grade levels. Professionally, Bob can only talk about K through 5; the rest are different animals. 
 
00:45:35  
Back when Bob felt more sense of collaboration, there was more sense that they were 
working together on something, because they were. They were inventing what they did. Even 
though there were differences, they had discussions or arguments about why or how or what did 
they want to achieve. But he never felt that someone else was deciding for him, and he doesn’t 
think the people he worked with felt that way either. Even people he didn’t network with, he thinks 
felt more in charge of what they were doing. Even if you didn’t agree, even among the cliques, the 
conversations were professional; people talked about ideas—why do you do it that way? I think it 
needs this….there were those discussions. The biggest change has been that the decisions have 
been taken away. “So when you’re told, ‘this is what you need to do’, there’s not that much to 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017 
6
discuss.” 
00:47:40  
What happens to teachers who are out of the mainstream? Bob knows of quite a few 
who are not teaching any more. They find something else to do. If you feel like ‘now it’s just a job’ 
there are other jobs that may have more open space for pushing one direction or another. “I mean, 
myself personally, I’ve let it become less important. Although maybe I’ve fooled myself, because I 
was in tears about it a moment ago. [laughs] I guess what I mean by that is, I have accepted certain 
limits, and I have to remind myself, ‘okay, you can be a certain way even if you’re not doing exactly 
the things you’d like to do.’ 
 So really, that is what it’s become for me, I just try to, as much as I can, and it’s more of a 
challenge, is to still have the relationships that I think are important, even if the kids aren’t learning 
in the way that I hoped they would. So I guess you either—you make compromises, or if you—I 
think if you—you have to have tremendous energy to push against the stream. And you have to 
have some support from people above you.” Bob thinks the parents appreciated the more 
alternative approach. With very few exceptions, parents have always been supportive in the ways 
that they can be. He had enthusiastic support—‘I’m so glad my child is in this classroom’—when 
they were doing inquiry-based projects. 
00:50:30 
“I think attitudes change, when you start asking about what should public education be 
and what should my child be allowed to do at school, I think there’s two different ideas. Because 
when you start talking—thinking about your own kid, who you know, you don’t think that they have 
to do everything at this particular level; you’re hoping that they find things that they love to so, and 
you’re hoping that they get a chance to pursue it. But for some reason, when it comes to public 
policy, it’s ‘everyone needs to be able to do these things.’” It’s not hard to get parent support if you 
are interested in finding out what kids are able to do. 
00:51:35  
“The best stories are the ways that kids figure things out. You know, by horrible 
mistakes, and you know, talking behavioral, academic, whatever. How kids grow, how kids figure 
things out, attempts that they make that are totally predictable. You know, here’s the situation and 
here’s the kid, and because you know the kid, you know what’s going to happen. And it’s usual ly 
the extraordinary. The extraordinary difficulties, or the successes or the—you know, just the 
personalities. There used to be a lot of ‘oh my god, I tried this and it totally failed.’  
One of my favorite stories was one that a friend of ours told about going to the marsh with a class 
full of kids, and it was prairie grass and cattails, and they turned the kids loose, two teachers did, 
and they immediately realized ‘Our kids are four feet tall and the grass is 8 feet tall. And we can’t—
they’re gone.’ [laughs] It’s like—it’s a funny thing. I left kids in the woods; I went back to my 
classroom and left two kids sitting on a trail, saying ‘don’t you move until I come and get you,’ and I 
had to get a ride back to the woods to go and get them, and there they were sitting. So those are 
stories that again depend upon the chaotic nature of the world. I mean, that’s what makes it 
interesting.”

When Bob isn’t talking with teachers, he is more selective in the stories he tells, because he realizes 
that he is no longer preaching to the choir. He chooses to tell things that demonstrate how kids 
learn, that challenges the conventional way of things. He does that with his family, with friends that 
aren’t in education. He has to do a lot of explaining, or used to; he’s really not in that kind of 
environment any more. He still tells stories about how kids figure things out in spite of what we’re 
trying to do. Teachers are willing to share things with each other that you don’t necessarily share 
with the neighbor. 
00:55:55  
There has been a change in Bob as a teacher; he doesn’t know how much is related to 
external changes. Maybe it just has to do with getting older. Early on, he put a lot more pressure on 
himself, and while that was helpful in some ways, it felt like he was driven and it was harder for him 
to enjoy what was accomplished. He was always a little unsatisfied. Today, he is not as driven to 
pushing everything, fighting. Mark: “Accepting the limits more.” Bob [laughing]: “I don’t know that I 
want to say accepting the limits!” Mark [laughing]: “You’re accommodating them better?” Bob: “I 
guess it is accepting. I mean, ugh, it makes me feel like a failure! [laughing] I mean, you have to—
they have to be accepted.  
And I guess really what it is, I made a decision that I’m not going to dedicate the level of time and 
energy, you know—I have other parts of my life that are rewarding. I have accepted that I’m not 
going to get as much out of teaching as I used to. I still enjoy it, and if I don’t, I’ll do something else. 
But I guess I just don’t think of myself as, ‘I’m a teacher.’ I am, but it’s not—I guess, I’m a person 
who teaches, and that person is no longer defined by myself as ‘I’m the teacher.’” 
00:58:50  
For good teaching, beyond any methodology, the most important thing is kindness. If 
there isn’t an interest or awareness of how kids are experiencing where they’re at, it doesn’t 
matter what you’re trying to do. That’s the most clear difference between good and bad teaching 
for Bob. “There are teachers who stick to curriculum that I would say is a waste of time but because 
they are people who are present with kids, I would say they are doing good work.” Bob feels okay 
not clinging to methodology and curriculum alone, because there is room for that. 
And that is what good teaching does. “It’s best done when there are real risks available to take, where 
kids are allowed to opt out/opt in, try something new. So I think it really has more to do with how you 
treat kids, on a personal level, more than anything else.” If you have those things, then there is 
another level that makes teaching good. Certainly you can grow into a good teacher. Bob sees that 
growth as a mission in life.  
Something that Bob has had to make an effort to grow in: patience. “I’ve had to make a huge effort to 
allow kids to struggle with just accepting the limits of the classroom. I think that the model that we 
have, from my view, is flawed from the start. So we’re asking kids to function in a kind of a fake 
environment, where you have one authority person, you have 20 that are supposed to be submitting 
to the authority, and it’s 8 hours a day, 180 days a year. It’s a huge imposition on a child’s life. And so, 
it’s easy as the teacher to begin to see the child as an obstacle, and I think I do that less than some, 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017

but that’s the daily challenge, that’s the thing that I continue to struggle with.” It’s easy to forget that 
you’re working with 8 year olds, because all of the ideas that you’re working with are not 8-year-old 
concepts. 
01:02:50  
How much did your undergraduate and graduate degrees help you with the things that 
you now think are important? Almost none. There were certain dilemmas highlighted that he found 
helpful, that set up opposing ideas that shed light on things to think about. Bob was part of the 
public system, so it’s taken for granted that this is the way school is. The university studies didn’t 
push much outside of that. Bob’s ideas about teaching and how kids learn were formed in the 
classroom, almost totally. A few exceptions: perception, number sense, ideas that are important. But 
college classes never really addressed how to get kids to try things, how to interact, what school is, 
what learning is.  
Bob’s classroom is maybe the only place he has ever learned anything. All the personal growth he 
has done has been hugely aided by the classroom. You can be open and honest in the work 
environment called teaching, with the kids, in a way that you don’t get in the rest of the world. Bob 
is proudest when he makes a kid feel differently about themselves, and when they feel like there is 
room for them in the world because of what happens to them in the classroom. Kids that maybe had 
the idea that this wasn’t the place for them, that found something different. Bob isn’t sure he can 
say he is proud of it—“Yeah, I did that!”—but that is the biggest reward.

Bob has tried different things to keep himself going, to refresh his teaching.  There 
have been years that have not been good, where he has just said, “So what,” had to sleep more, 
meditation, exercise. Really, when things get hard, the only thing that works for Bob is to take better 
care of himself. But that took a long time to learn. What advice would Bob have for a young teacher? 
Bob would have to know why he/she wanted to teach. “I would say first, if you really are into 
learning, how kids learn, watching them learn, I would say, don’t go for the public system. I would 
say, look for an alternative. Go to Waldorf, go to Montesorri, do something that’s outside the 
mainstream. Because I really don’t see things changing. Or, if I thought that it was relationships, you 
know, kind of like the reason I wanted to go into it, I wouldn’t discourage them but I would 
encourage them to think about other positions that might work for that, without the downside.  
I mean, really, I’d have a hard time saying to—you know, I’ve worked with a lot—especially recently, 
I’ve worked with a lot of younger teachers that come out of college. And I don’t know what colleges 
but--totally signed in on the, ‘let’s look at the numbers, let’s look at what do these kids not know’—a 
total deficit model. And I don’t think that good for anybody. I don’t think it’s good for the teachers 
or the kids.”

How did Bob’s experience in Brazil modify his teaching here? It was a private school, 
very high income. The parents had different expectations and the school catered to their 
expectations. You didn’t have the question about what was expected of the children; that was very 
clear. Bob didn’t necessarily agree with it, but he made the decision upfront that he was

going to teach the way they wanted him to teach. It was painful because it was text book approach. 
It taught him two things: he can function in that system, and the kids present the same challenges in 
a little bit different ways. Bob still got to build a culture of ‘we listen to each other.’ They did all the 
things that made them all part of a group. But coming back, there are so many similarities: testing, 
graphs about the students, red flags about kids who are likely to need intensive support. So it didn’t 
change a lot, it made him realize that this problem is bigger than the United States.  
In the Heron Network, Bob had a reputation for having a lively sense of humor with his students, 
very playful interaction with kids. [sound of doorbell; text message from Bob’s wife; recording 
placed on hold]. Sometimes Bob would do sheer trickery just because he liked to do it. One time he 
fooled the 2nd and 3rd grade class by coming to school dressed as a woman, with his cheeks stuffed 
with cotton, a wig and make-up. He called himself Miss Grunt. “I think that 2nd and 3rd graders like to 
let themselves believe things, and I think some were totally unaware that it was me. Some had 
enough of a suspicion that they smiled a little bit, but they weren’t so sure that they were going to 
challenge Miss Grunt, and say you are Mr. Weisner. And that was really, really interesting. I actually 
broke character right before lunch when two kids almost got in a fight. And then I spoke with my 
regular voice. And then one of them—he was one who was totally unaware, and he [snaps finger]—I 
mean, he forgot what was—the nature of the conflict was gone. He was looking at me, like, ‘what’—
I mean for the rest of the day, the class was telling me stories about what Miss Grunt had said and I 
had to keep reminding them, ‘I know. I was there.’ [laughs]”  
Bob has done all kinds of things like that, not as involved. He has learned all kinds of things about 
what kids can comprehend, and when they get along, seeming to get a joke but they don’t. He has 
made some mistakes with that. One child told him that his dad had helped him with his math, and 
Bob said, “And I suppose he has a teaching license.” And the kid said, “No, he doesn’t.” And Bob 
went over the top, he raised his voice and said “I will report you to the Department of Public 
Instruction!” And the kid was laughing along with Bob, and Bob thought he got it. But the kid went 
home that night, and Bob got a phone call from his mother saying “John has told me something that 
I’m sure you didn’t say…” and Bob raced back in his mind trying to remember what he said. “He said 
that his father is not allowed to help him…” and the mother was upset about it.  
Bob is sure there have been many conversations at the dinner table about things that Mr. Weisner 
has said in the classroom, that either parents have decided to let go or told their kids ‘oh no, he’s 
joking.’ In general, humor for Bob is a way to develop intimacy, a way you invite someone to share a 
silly thing or a challenging thing in a way that they can brush off or giggle, whatever they want to do. 
When he discovers he has gone overboard, he apologizes. It is worth the risk to sometimes need to 
apologize, to go ahead and be playful. It’s the same kind of mistake you might make by speaking out 
of excitement and sounding angry. Or be angry and say something that is a little too harsh; that’s 
the openness of being a human being, being allowed to say ‘I shouldn’t have done that, next time I’ll  
check with you.’

He did the same thing in Brazil—you would think he’d learn after 20 years in the classroom—he 
said, ‘we are starting something today called Standardized Rigor [laughs] and he scared one of the 
students. He could see the student getting anxious, so he broke it off right then. It was April Fool’s 
Day; she was very angry with Bob, tears in her eyes: ‘you shouldn’t have done that, you scared me!’ 
It taught Bob two things: he still doesn’t know when to quit and the pressure that these kids feel  is 
real.
