[Cowboy's?] Lament"Let sixteen gamblers come handle my coffin,Let sixteen cowboys come sing
me a song,Take me to the graveyard and lay the sod o'er me,For I'm a poor cowboy and I know I've
[done?] wrong.We beat the drum slowly and played the fife slowly,And bitterly wept as we bore him
along;For we all loved our [comrade?], so brave, young and handsome,We all loved our comrade
although he'd [done?] wrong."
