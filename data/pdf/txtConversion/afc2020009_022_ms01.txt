LENORE GUSTEN, Ceramic restoration 
Katy Clune  00:00 
It is Friday, June 11 2021. Katy Clune here with Julia Gartrell in Bethea?, North Carolina— 
 
Lenore Gusten  00:10 
Pfafftown. 
 
KC  00:10 
Pfafftown [NC].And we're here with—if you would introduce yourself and what you do for a living? 
 
LG  00:18 
I am Lenore Gusten, and I am a ceramic restoration artist. 
 
KC  00:27 
Tell us a little bit about your business and—Actually, we're going to, we're going to back up. Tell me 
where you were born and a little bit about how you grew up and what your parents did.  
 
LG  00:39 
I was born in Buffalo, New York. My dad was a truck driver. My mom was a homemaker until my 
parents divorced. And then she worked in retail and became a manager at a little store. And she did well 
for her, considering that women weren't always afforded the same opportunities. [laughs] 
 
LG  01:06 
I then moved to Madison, Wisconsin, to finish my degree. [crackling noises in background, chair 
creaking] Which I didn't, because I decided that public administration was not following an art path. 
And I followed their most famous dropout, John Muir, and moved to California.  
 
LG  01:23 
And I was there for about 20 years. That's when I met Joe [Gusten, her husband]. And we, after we got 
married, we decided we wanted to start a business that we could be at home, didn't have to travel a lot, 
afc2020009_022—Lenore Gusten interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell

only if we wanted to, and use our art backgrounds. Because we both had art backgrounds. He was 
working for a high-end furniture manufacturer, and he did all their custom color before the computers 
took over doing it. So he he would do it by eye.  
 
LG  01:54 
I worked for computer software company. I was a design manager. But I always wanted to do my art 
stuff. So we saw an ad for this. And we we were antique dealers at the time, part time and we just 
couldn't fathom you could fix pottery or porcelain, and intrigued us. So he took the class—we figured 
we didn't both need to take the class. And he brought home all the information, and we started 
practicing, and I started doing a lot of r&d [research and development] on materials, and reading more 
about conservators and conservation and what that was, what were museum requirements, and tried to 
incorporate that into what our vision for our business was.  
 
LG  02:47 
And we didn't want to just be mending pots as best we could and it didn't look good. We created our 
own standard and—months of r&d. So we came up with the materials, pretty much I mean, I keep 
upgrading materials, but the materials I use today are pretty much what we've done all our research on. 
 
KC  03:10 
What was the ad that you saw? 
 
LG  03:12 
[3:12] It just said, "Class for Pottery and Porcelain Restoration."  
 
KC  03:32 
You were in California? 
 
LG  03:38 
We were in the Bay Area in San Jose.  
 
KC  03:41 
afc2020009_022—Lenore Gusten interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell

Nice. I used to live in Berkeley.  
 
LG  03:41 
Its nice in Berkeley. I used to live in San Francisco too.  
 
KC  03:48 
So what year was this, that you saw the ad, and Joe took the class? 
 
LG  03:54 
[19]'93. And then we we put together our business and started in '94. 
 
KC  04:03 
And what were your art—you said you were always doing your art stuff—introduce that to us. 
 
LG  04:12 
I grew up always drawing and probably designing things in my head. And then I went, got interested in 
fiber arts. And I did all sorts of things in fiber arts. When I was going through grad school, I made a line 
of stuffed toys that were personalized for whoever you were giving them to.  
 
LG  04:40 
So I made, like, punk elephants that had, you know, red mohawks, and lots of earrings, torn sweatshirts 
and—but whatever it would be. I think the funniest thing I made is somebody's friend had a heart attack 
and he could go bowling with him but he couldn't have the reuben sandwich they always had so they 
asked me to make a stuffed reuben sandwich.  
 
LG  05:01 
I was like, okay, what's on a reuben? I didn't know. And I went out got a bunch of different kinds of 
fabrics and made a stuffed reuben. And then I did some quiltmaking. That's a lot of design, probably 
more design that actually finishing them, but did lots of work on that.  
 
LG  05:22 
afc2020009_022—Lenore Gusten interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell

And when we, we started this business, its the same thing, it's using colors. To me, it's like every skill 
you have just builds for the next project, whatever you do. And mine was seeing color, working with 
color, because you have to do that with fabrics, so worked with color. And so that part was pretty easy.  
 
LG  05:45 
I used to buy and sell old furniture. Another way to go through grad school was, I would buy it during 
the year, and then once a year, I'd have a blowout sale. That's how I could not take on student debt for at 
least one semester. 
 
KC  06:02 
Because you'd restored a little—? 
 
LG  06:04 
I'd restore it. So I already knew about doing furniture restoration. Little bit. Joe had done it for a lot of 
years. So. Each of those skills works with what we're doing. 
 
Julia Gartrell  06:19 
So what is—so, it put your skills together in this nice way. Were you surprised to be kind of swept down 
this path of ceramic repair? It's so it's so different, really, in some ways from what you were doing, 
artistically. 
 
LG  06:40 
Probably. I think, even the whole path to get here to have to go into software, and all of that. And I 
mean, it was all, "Okay." But I guess I looked at it all is like, "Well, you know, I can use this, this is a 
great, I'll learn something." 
 
LG  06:55 
I think that's what I liked the most. And in, in doing the ceramic repair, I got a taste for, "Maybe I want 
to make pottery." Because I look at this stuff. And I did a lot of research to know, How was it made?," 
so that I could understand the glaze. And when I'm replicating it, if I know how it was made, then I got a 
better chance of replicating it.  
afc2020009_022—Lenore Gusten interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell

LG  07:17 
So then I started taking pottery classes about 20 years ago. And I like it. I do slab-built work because 
like textiles, you roll out a slab, you got a flat, two dimensional thing that you can make into something 
three dimensional. It's like—I understood that part of it. I'm really understood that. So I think they all 
kind of fold into each other. They just—I wasn't the person that woke up and said, "This is what I want 
to be for the rest of my life." That never was me. I was okay with, "Eh, we'll see what happens." 
 
KC  07:56 
What is your graduate degree in? 
 
LG  07:59 
It's an almost degree, I was a few credits short of public administration. My undergraduate was political 
science, emphasis in Middle Eastern Studies, far afield from whatever I have done. 
 
KC  08:13 
That's a-okay. How did you and Joe, kind of, get the sense that you were good at this, and it was a viable 
business.? 
 
LG  08:26 
We had done some furniture restoration together. So we understood that. So, it's like, we knew the 
basics, just looking at it's like, "Well, it's broken. So you have to glue it, you got to do that, and the other 
one. You're gonna have to fill it. See, all you have to know is what materials do they actually use? And 
then you have to paint it to match the surrounding areas, like, "Oh, I kind of get that."  
 
LG  08:48 
So we thought, "Yeah, this is something we could be good at." At the time, there was a need for it. 
Because, the antiques markets, the collection—people were collecting arts and crafts pottery. And I'm 
saying "arts and crafts" is from the turn of the last century. It was an American phenomenon that was 
extremely popular.  
 
afc2020009_022—Lenore Gusten interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
6 
LG  09:13 
In fact, as soon as we told some of our antique dealer friends that we were going to do this. They said, 
"Well, let us know when you're ready, and they made us an instant cue of pottery to be fixed. So it 
probably was a good time to do it.  
 
JG  09:30 
Has that changed? Is it still busy, busy?  
 
LG  09:34 
Um, we're busy enough for us. But the collector's market has fallen off. I think the average age of the 
collectors is up there, that they've collected all they wanted. And you can see the antique shows, they've 
been diminishing over time. So the collection of the sort of things that we were fixing is disappearing for 
now. I mean, you know, probably another 50 years, it'll all come back and it'll be the rage again. But it's 
it's dwindling down. 
 
JG  10:11 
So what sorts of things do you find yourself working on now? 
 
LG  10:15 
I would say this is where the clientele has changed. It would be a super collector, somebody that is 
incredibly knowledgeable, they will have us fix a very rare piece, you know. If they can't find it whole, 
they will get it fixed. Most of our clientele is aging out. So sometimes they're fixing things so that their 
heirs don't throw it out. Because they're really afraid that nothing will be saved, that they'll either pitch it 
in the garbage, or send it off to Goodwill. So we fix things that way. That's kind of a sad thing to do, 
that, you know, your kids don't get it. But that's reality. 
 
KC  11:05 
Sometimes they're probably fixing it also,  to like gift it to their kids? Or is it more like the kids are 
totally uninterested? [crosstalk] 
 
LG  11:13 
afc2020009_022—Lenore Gusten interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
7 
They're gifting it, they're gifting it. But they know that if it has something wrong with it, it won't be 
accepted. They could accept it with something wrong all these years, but they know their kids or 
grandkids want it perfect. Rarely, I hear that it's just a gift. 
 
JG  11:36 
Could you describe the process of receiving a broken object? Let's say this plate (that's behind us) or the 
cup? What steps do you take to get it back to being perfect? 
 
LG  11:50 
Yes. So the first thing we do is assess what the materials actually are. Because ceramics, lots of different 
textures involved. So we have to make sure that whatever appears to be the glaze is stable, like the plate 
you're focusing on over there, that's been painted with acrylic paints, by whoever did it. So I already 
knew when I looked at it that that's not stable, so we have to take extra care.  
 
LG  12:21 
Then we glue it together. If there's some glue on it, we got to remove all traces of the old glue. Glue it 
together. And then we make our own fill materials out of epoxy and fillers. And then I would tint it with 
powder pigments. You sand that back, till it's smooth, it has to be ultra smooth.  
 
LG  12:45 
And then paint those areas where the crack lines are—not the whole plate. If you know, it's not 
damaged, no sense since painting it. And we paint all those areas, and we match the original finish and 
colors, any of the design. If the design is missing, we'll do the best we can to make sure that it connects 
in a way that looks like it was—that's the way it originally looked like. If we can get a picture, we'll 
make it look exactly like the picture. 
 
KC  13:18 
How do you match the finish? 
 
LG  13:23 
afc2020009_022—Lenore Gusten interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
8 
We use a spray finish on top that we manipulate how much flattening agent is in it. So some things you 
see, well in this room, you see a bright and shiny? That would get the the gloss finish. And there are 
some things that are matte or medium matte, then we just add some matting agent to just tone down the 
sheen.  
 
KC  13:48 
And you do—? 
 
LG  13:50 
Just the area. Just the area and a little bit beyond the area. And then there's some products that can be 
used to kind of blend it out from there. But we, the last thing we want to do is coat the whole thing. 
 
KC  14:05 
So in addition to your skills in color matching, and you know, painting, and the hand skills—would you 
say the materials you've developed over the years to do this are your biggest asset? Because it sounds 
very—potentially like you wouldn't necessarily tell others how you know what exactly goes into your 
fillers because you've cracked the code and— 
 
LG  14:31 
Actually I share that freely. I mean the thing that sets us apart is making the colors match. That is the 
toughest thing. I really liked doing studio glazes which is this piece over here. That's a studio glaze. 
That's a difficult thing to paint because it's not one color. It's not a, it's not a definite pattern that you can 
see, you have to paint in the randomness and that—even if you knew how to make the proprietary fill 
you still need to paint. 
 
JG  15:08 
There's a certain skill that's not really teachable.  
 
LG  15:14 
That's true. And we have, we have taught. And if you have an art background, and you can see color, 
you could learn this. Painters sometimes have a hard time because they don't have to match. Whatever 
afc2020009_022—Lenore Gusten interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
9 
it's in your head, you can just squeeze it out of the tube or, you can just paint. Its not matching anything 
except what's in your mind. Matching is is difficult. 
 
KC  15:40 
I imagine these lights help. [her studio lights] 
 
LG  15:43 
They do. They're a combination of a couple of different tones of light so that we can approximate most 
of the kind of lighting things will be seen under. They can be seen under fluorescence, they can be seen 
outside, and inside your house.  
 
LG  16:01 
So sometimes I might even bring in a third light to light something. Like blues. Blues don't—blues just 
defy explanation. They turn different colors, they can turn purple-ish, they can turn green-ish. So I use 
the varying lights to help me get some tone right in the middle so that when the person who receives it 
looks at it, it's going to look right. 
 
JG  16:28 
Do you find yourself noticing colors in the world trying to figure out how they're put together? 
 
LG  16:36 
Yes. I've also done oil painting. And so that, noticing the color, and noticing the layers of color, that 
even when I look at stuff out in the world, and just I'm always drawn to, there's layers of color. But there 
isn't one color. Nothing's made of one color. 
 
KC  16:56 
Looking at your book [portfolio book of past work in her studio], there's some pieces that you're 
completely rebuilding parts that weren't there. Is that material, explain the difference between that 
process versus filling a crack. 
 
LG  17:05 
afc2020009_022—Lenore Gusten interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
10 
I'm using the same material. And I tint it. But, if I'm making a handle, I might use a wire armature to put 
the fill around, or I just wait for it to set up a little more. Because the fill the fill is thick. Filling a crack, 
I don't need it very thick, you know, just enough to fill the crack. 
 
LG  17:42 
But to say, fill like a, chunk of a rim that's missing, I need it to stiffen up a little bit. So I can fill it in 
there. Sometimes I'll need to prop, like hold the back of it with a piece of tape or something, so that it 
doesn't sink totally. And it always helps that I've determined a long time ago: Be prepared to do it twice. 
You know, add more to it, because something will go wrong. 
 
KC  18:11 
Are there things you can't accept? 
 
LG  18:16 
That I can't accept? [laughter] 
 
KC  18:17 
Well, not in life in general! [laughter]  
 
KC  18:17 
Are there ceramics that are beyond your repair that you have to disappoint people with that news. And 
what is it that makes it unfixable? 
 
LG  18:25 
Well yeah, but [laughs] 
 
LG  18:28 
Occasionally—well, if it's too smashed, personally, yeah, we could do it. But I really don't think there's a 
whole lot of value in recreating the whole thing. I will go find replacements for people if it's possible, 
because it's just not worth it.  
 
afc2020009_022—Lenore Gusten interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
11 
LG  19:00 
Sometimes the bisque pieces, some of the Native American pieces, if they're very badly smashed, that is 
hard to put back together. The bisque, because of the way they color their pieces, is sometimes a little bit 
harder to make it look exact. And it's probably, what I do is probably passable. But it doesn't feel that to 
me. Because I can't make it look just like it's supposed to. I can't make the texture exactly what it's 
supposed to. I kinda, I kind of would pass on those. 
 
KC  19:39 
And clarify bisque? 
 
LG  19:41 
Bisque is when you run it through the kiln the first time—I don't think I have anything in here that's 
bisque—when you run it through the first time, it has no glaze. They might have color, but it has no 
glaze. And depending on how you fired it, it's got a texture that's hard to replicate.  
 
JG  20:05 
Do you ever have to fire pieces that you're working on?  
 
LG  20:08 
Can't fire them because. . . Well, you have no idea what they were fired at first time. So you run the risk 
of them exploding in the kiln because there may be a hidden crack. Melting. I've, I've seen old Meissen 
dinnerware that someone was very proud that they fired. And they turned a cobalt blue decoration to 
pink. Because they're firing it at too hot a temperature, the glaze changed.  
 
LG  20:37 
And then they bring out, if it's at the wrong temperature, it'll bring out the impurities—that were there to 
begin with—but because they fired at a different temperature, it all of a sudden blooms, and that's 
permanent. It's just, to me, permanently damaged. That is—part what we do is we will do no more 
damage. So we don't fire. 
 
JG  21:01 
afc2020009_022—Lenore Gusten interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
12 
That seems like a good promise [laughter]. So, you mentioned Meissen, how do you—how do you learn 
about the history of the pieces? And at what point does that become important? Or is it important? 
 
LG  21:25 
Well, we were antique dealers before. I've always had an interest in old stuff. So I had a little bit of 
knowledge. I mean, real little bit of knowledge. And as people brought us stuff, especially in the early 
days, when it's mostly antique dealers, they brought the story. What was it? Is it important? I learned 
about all sorts of potters I'd never heard of. Or movements. Because people would inform me.  
 
LG  21:53 
And then I'd go do some research. And where it becomes important is—say its a Meissen. I know 
Meissen, after time, it's a certain, it's a certain batch of colors and kind of know what it's going to be. 
The white's going to be a certain white. The Chinese porcelains, the old porcelains—I know what their 
pink is now. I mean, to begin with, I wouldn't have figured it out at all.  
 
LG  22:20 
But you kind of get a feel for it. And it helps with the restoration. Because you kind of know the glazes, 
how they did it. What to expect if it's missing. I could say, if something's missing, that, "Now I know 
who made that, I would expect this or that to be in this spot." 
 
JG  22:40 
Does the internet help with any of that?  
 
LG  22:42 
Oh, a lot. I do a lot of my research that way. In the first days, there was some internet, not too much. 
But—I relied mostly on books, which was, there's so many things not in books. With the internet, I don't 
know, people post all sorts of pictures of things. And all I need is a picture. And I have found pictures of 
some unbelievable Meissen, so I can tell people what they're missing. So then they could decide if they 
want to fix it, because there's a lot missing. Or I could tell them—they said "Oh, it's just a finger" and 
"No, that piece has a basket attached to it, or any piece looks like that, she had flowers in her hand. It's 
just what I would expect. And then I can go on the internet and very often I can find something like that. 
afc2020009_022—Lenore Gusten interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
13 
 
KC  23:33 
And you and Joe were partners in the business, are partners? 
 
LG  23:37 
Yes. 
 
KC  23:38 
So, do you have different things you specialize in? Or how would you divide the work? 
 
LG  23:47 
He really could do the airbrush and the base colors on things. That's what he did. I had done all the detail 
painting. I also do the sculpting. And then you know, we crosstrain, you have to crosstrain. So we could 
do most anything the other one does. And then a few years ago he decided that he was retiring. 
 
KC  24:14 
You're not ready it?  
 
LG  24:16 
Oh no, there's no such thing as retirement. You're just onto something new.  
 
KC  24:23 
Tell us about a job or two that you'll were particularly proud of. 
 
LG  24:30 
Probably the most interesting one was—the museum, MESDA, its the Museum of Early Southern 
Decorative Arts. And they were having an exhibit that they were sending around the country. And they 
had a porringer, or it's—it's a bowl that had a little handle. And the handle was missing. The piece was 
on loan to them. They wanted a handle on it and the owner did not want to handle put on it. And I 
reached out to the other restorers I know that are in Europe, that deal with more museum stuff, and stuff 
afc2020009_022—Lenore Gusten interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
14 
the age of this—we're talking pottery made in the 1700s. And they never heard of doing a removable 
handle. But I figured, "Well?" 
 
LG  25:19 
I did it. I mean, I did a—you know, put some saran wrap on and attached it that way. So my glaze would 
look like it was right. And then I just, there's this stuff called Plasti-Tak that you hang posters up with, 
and I decided, "Well, I'll try that." Just a little bit in there and stick it on. And it looked good. It looked 
real good. So it made its tour before, I don't know, at this point, they've probably retired the little handle 
[laughs]. But it did its job. And it was something very different. 
 
KC  25:51 
It's kind of a good way of setting up a question: How like, how do you like—What are your strengths 
and weaknesses versus a ceramics conservator in a museum? 
 
LG  26:08 
I think the conservator in the museum . . . they do a lot of testing and documentation. And I'm probably 
a little freer to not do as much documentation, although I will do it. But I have to on a regular basis do 
that. Uh, I don't—the ceramics conservationist, they're doing pretty much what I'm doing. You're 
cleaning. The materials may be a little different. But as long as you highlight what they are, it's okay. So 
we do the same cleaning.  
 
LG  26:52 
When I do the restoration, sometimes it—actually it depends on where, what museum it's at. Some want 
to see it. So museum restoration, where everybody says they do "museum quality," that doesn't mean 
you can't see it. That means you're doing some sort of a fill, a color fill, and you can see it. Well, I can 
do that. I don't like doing it. They're accustomed to it. And they're, they're happy with it. But I can do it.  
 
LG  27:25 
So we use the same steps, we use a lot of the same materials. Actually, that was part of my research, is 
to find out what materials they were using, to make sure I was using appropriate materials. And not use 
what somebody—that maybe does YouTube videos to teach you how to do it—that I was using 
afc2020009_022—Lenore Gusten interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
15 
appropriate materials. So that down the road, should it go to a museum, and they don't like the 
restoration, they don't want it with the restoration, that they could remove everything I've done, and it 
would be fine. 
 
KC  28:00 
I can see kind of seeing yourself as a steward of these objects.  
 
LG  28:05 
I have probably grown up feeling like a steward of everything that comes in your life. So it's hard for me 
to throw things out. So yeah, I think we can we can say that about them. 
 
KC  28:19 
Do you have to deal with emotions, or less so if you're with, if it's mostly—I think you said now your 
business is kind of super-advanced collectors? But do you deal with the emotions of people when they 
come to you with a piece—? 
 
LG  28:40 
All the time. Because there's usually some story attached to every piece. For them to want to spend 
money on restoring it, there has to be something in it. Very few dispassionate people. Some people get 
really upset they can't afford to do it.  
 
LG  28:57 
And you know, the piece doesn't have the monetary value. And it's like, well, I can't help that. I mean, 
you know. 
 
KC  29:07 
How do you price your services? 
 
LG  29:09 
afc2020009_022—Lenore Gusten interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
16 
I price my services according to how much work it takes. So the 99-cent thing that you found at 
Goodwill will be priced same as $100,000 thing that has the same damage, because that's really all the 
difference is.  
 
JG  29:25 
That's very equitable. Do you have an example of a really moving, or funny, or strange story of 
something that someone brought in? 
 
LG  29:40 
I've got two stories that are—one is funny and the other one is touching. She came to us with a cocoa 
pot. She was in her late 80s. [crosstalk] A cocoa pot? They were made, like, in the 1880s—all these 80s 
together—but. It was an old Limoges cocoa pot. So it's like a coffee pot, only taller. And it was broken. 
And she said she broke it when she was like 10 years old. And her grand—it was her grandmother's, and 
her grandmother said, "So this is all you're going to inherit." And I'm thinking, "What a mean grandma!" 
But anyways, she's in her 80s. This has bothered her since she was 10 years old! And yes, she did inherit 
it.  
 
LG  30:26 
So we fixed it up and I got a phone call from her she was in tears, because she hadn't seen it whole since 
before she broke it. And we just thought, we made her day. She was just so, so moved that she finally 
fixed what she broke.  
 
LG  30:45 
The other one was a single plate that—This woman said she didn't have the set, because, from the 
time—From the ancestor that got it, there's a lot of cousins. And so everybody's got maybe one or two 
pieces. And the story was, it was her great,-great—As was the custom in the 1800s, late 1800s, young 
women, women might be sent over to England to work in, I guess, work with the Royals. Anyways, her 
great-great went over, she got caught in a compromising position with one of the Royals. And she was 
given a one way ticket, paid ticket, all the way back to Colorado with a set of Victoria's old used china. 
And this was one of them. And that cracked me up, because it was really much older than Victoria's 
afc2020009_022—Lenore Gusten interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
17 
rule, so we know that it was her used stuff. She packed her off. No severance pay. A set of china and a 
one way ticket. That was th funniest story. 
 
JG  31:57 
Hilarious. When you fix something, when you fix the plate, is it usable in the way it used to be used? 
 
LG  32:05 
No. I mean, you can, but I would, I would suggest not. Because all the fixes are on top of what's there. 
And I don't know, you—it doesn't go through the dishwasher. It won't go through lots of wear. It'll last a 
while. But it will eventually start to fall apart. So we will usually hook people up with replacements, or 
I'll go online and find it for them.  
 
LG  32:38 
Because sometimes they're so upset about it. And it's like, its really easy to look up. You know, just— 
 
JG  32:45 
Do you have a relationship with Replacements Limited, or—? 
 
LG  32:48 
Yes, before we even started doing this business, we had met Bob Page a long time ago in California. He 
used to come out for annual buying trips. And when we moved here, we just call to say "Hi," you know. 
Actually, we never even told him what we were doing, we were bringing our friends, when they come to 
visit. You know, we're from earthquake country. And so we would take them there, "You got to see how 
high they pile this china!" [laughter] And we'd go in there and say, "God, one little shake and this is 
going to all come down."  
 
LG  33:24 
So we went, and as we were going through, it was a light tour, where there was only us. And she said, 
"Well, what do you all do?" And our friends said, what we did. "Oh, we got to take you on a special tour 
to come back to our restoration department." And so it just started a, you know, a relationship with 
them. That they give out our name. And we know that they do some glass repair that we don't do, so I 
afc2020009_022—Lenore Gusten interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
18 
always give their names ou. And replace, you know. I've made some customers really happy by just 
hooking them up. They have exactly what you broke. 
 
KC  34:03 
We interviewed Horace McKee, who works at Replacements in ceramic restoration, and says that he 
developed a way to re-fire bone china that the manufacturers had a hard time believing. 
 
LG  34:22 
Well I know they've been working on re-firing for years. We haven't talked with them in a year or so 
about that. But I know when they got their front loader kilns. They changed managers since then, but 
yeah, they were working on it. They blew up and broke and destroyed a whole bunch of dishes. So it 
was something, they said, "Don't tell anybody we do it, because we don't do it for the general public." 
They just do it for themselves. So like, they could get rid of crazing, so the piece is sellable.  
 
JG  34:54 
And can you define crazing? 
 
LG  34:55 
Pardon? 
 
JG  34:58 
Can you define crazing? 
 
LG  35:01 
Oh you know, the little cracking you dishes? That—it just means the glaze is, over time, becoming 
compatible with the body. And it'll just, you know, food can get in there and it can be unsanitary and . . .  
 
KC  35:21 
Are there pieces that you enjoy working on more than others?  
 
LG  35:25 
afc2020009_022—Lenore Gusten interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
19 
I enjoy studio pieces. I enjoy the challenge of that.  
 
KC  35:30 
Do you get a fair amount of, like, North Carolina studio pieces? 
 
LG  35:35 
Oh, it depends on whoever is the hot old maker from that time. So this, this particular—[looking at large 
green studio ceramic vase next to her] it's could be a Cole, it could be a Royal Crown [North Carolina 
Royal Crown Pottery and Porcelain Company]. But that glaze. The modern folks call it malachite, but 
the family calls it double-dip green. [laughter] 
 
LG  35:57 
It's also my favorite glaze too. So the guy that brought this to me, I was like, "That's my favorite glaze." 
But yes, we've done some of the, some of the red ones—and some of the, that are mottled, they call it 
chrome red—and just gorgeous glazes. 
 
KC  36:14 
What about the old salt glaze? 
 
LG  36:17 
We do those too.  
 
KC  36:19 
That almost has iridescence. 
 
LG  36:24 
We do that—I'm trying to think, the iridescence—I've done some that they call gunmetal. Has a little bit 
of sheen to it. Most of the salt glazed, or the North Carolina salt glazed—Oh, Albany slip has that [type 
of glaze]. I don't think the collectors are collecting it as much because I haven't seen any in years. But I 
still see Catawba Valley stuff that, like Daniel Seagle, and they have these great glazes. And people love 
their drips, they put glass on it, and they'd have these wonderful drips down it. So we remake handles for 
afc2020009_022—Lenore Gusten interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
20 
those kinds of pieces. I think I have some, some in the queue, that need to be done pretty soon, that I 
need to make new handles for. 
 
KC  37:05 
I told an acquaintance I was working on this project and he said, "If you find anyone that can repair an 
old Ben Owen candlestick let me know." 
 
LG  37:15 
Oh, okay. I can do Ben Owen. [crosstalk, laughter] No, we've done Ben Owen candlesticks. We've done 
a lot of Ben Owens. We've done some of his grandson's work to— 
 
KC  37:34 
Trevor? 
 
LG  37:35 
Ben. He was surprised that somebody, I said, "Well, you wouldn't believe it, you ground off a glaze drip, 
and they wanted it back on!" [laughs]  
 
JG  37:50 
Is there anything you would prefer to never see again? 
 
LG  37:54 
I have a personal belief that when you say that you draw it close you. [laughter] Because every time—
for years—I always said I hated yadro [glaze]. It's just a funky color. And every time I said that, I'd get a 
rash and now there'd be you know, the phone would be ringing.  
 
JG  38:18 
Okay we won't test that.  
 
LG  38:22 
afc2020009_022—Lenore Gusten interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
21 
Every once in a while, I'll get through a piece and say, "Never again." And then comes the next one. 
Probably the, people say, "Oh no, I know you can do it." Even though it's outside my scope. Yes, I do 
work on, you can see there's some plaster stuff there. Oh, I'll repair plaster and stone. But when they get 
into lacquer boxes, that was one thing I'd never do. Again. It was a lacquer, a mid-century lacquered 
cube.  
 
LG  38:55 
And they had put it in a place that the finish started coming off. That was insanely difficult and insanely 
impossible to get it to match exactly. And he didn't care, it had a finish on it, for me, I worked so long to 
try to get that exactly right. And no, I'm not doing that again. You can find a woodworker for that, 
 
KC  39:23 
Talk about the satisfaction you find in this work. 
 
LG  39:27 
I enjoy stuffs not going to the trash heap. I enjoy making people happy. Because there's a lot of people 
just so happy to see, something as mundane is their cookie jar that belonged to mom, put back together 
because they had a bad day and they broke the lid. It's just, it's just nice. And there's the personal 
satisfaction of getting a studio glaze right. 
 
KC  40:03 
Is this a good field to go into, when you could step back and consider the overall collector's market? 
 
LG  40:12 
You mean to now to do it? There will always be a need for somebody to repair broken stuff. Because 
we're, we're humans. We're breaking stuff all the time. I have found the people that have asked me about 
learning it, they want something that they can take very little time, and just do it.  
 
LG  40:39 
They don't realize that there's more to it than just gluing it together and slapping paint on it. There's a 
little more than that. So it's hard because they're not going to make a million bucks doing it. And it takes 
afc2020009_022—Lenore Gusten interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
22 
time. I mean, we're still learning it. There's stuff comes in, and you learn something else, like, "Oh, man, 
I could have been doing this all along. This is the best one I've ever done!" 
 
JG  41:06 
Do you have someone to take over your business, when you do? I mean, you're not retired, but? 
 
LG  41:12 
No. By the time I decided to do something else? No. We've tried. We've had a couple of apprentices. 
The last apprentice, after two years, was still afraid to handle a piece that might have had monetary 
value. I mean, I would always tell him, just say, "It has no value when it's broken." I mean [shrugs], so 
that you don't have to think about the money. It has no value. Even if it is old, that doesn't mean 
anything. But he just couldn't get past that. And it's just not the job for him.  
 
LG  41:51 
And then we had others, we had another one that just, she just really wasn't interested in being, she 
thought it could be a part-time gig, so she only had to show up part-time. And it's like, "well, no, that's 
not—" It could be a part-time gig after you put your shingle out and you know what you're doing, but 
before then have to put your time and to, to learn it. [crosstalk] 
 
KC  42:22 
Any advice for like a young person going into this field? 
 
LG  42:27 
If they'd really like to go into it? They should be prepared to put the time in. I also see, I get stuff from 
my alma mater in Buffalo. It's State University College of Buffalo. They actually have a conservation 
program. They never had that when I went to school. I mean, I probably would have signed up for it. But 
they do have them. I think it's something that universities are starting to teach. And they should by all 
means, go that route to learn it. Because you can once you have that knowledge, you can always spin it 
off any way you want to.  
 
LG  43:06 
afc2020009_022—Lenore Gusten interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
23 
Yes, if they're interested, they should they should pursue it. They probably pursued it for, this is private 
practice. You're not going to make a million bucks doing it. They should know that. That it's not 
extremely lucrative. Museums are, their funding—I don't know, you've probably heard this from 
others—their fundings have been cut back a lot. So I don't know. They'll just have to research it at the 
time and see if maybe if the museums get more funding, they'll be more willing to hire people. They 
should look at that. 
 
KC  43:50 
This is a question way back to the beginning of your interview. But what made you leave California for 
North Carolina?  
 
LG  43:57 
Well, we were doing this for several years back there. And although we had a lot of business—we had a 
year's backlog of stuff. People would come, would commonly say, "Huh, look at this. What do you do 
for your day job? You can't tell me you make money doing this." 
 
LG  44:22 
And we started looking around and I have a painting in the house, its where my dream ranch is. And I 
would go out there, I couldn't afford my dream ranch. There was no way I was going to afford my dream 
ranch. Even if I went back into software. It wasn't going to happen.  
 
LG  44:41 
So we just thought, "Well, let's just put a finger on the map and choose someplace else." And we chose 
here. I'd looked at North Carolina quite a few years before and it kind of was, we have relatives in 
Atlanta. We have relatives up in Buffalo. And we looked at the weather and Atlanta is just too hot and 
up north is just too cold.  
 
LG  45:09 
So we figured this was, this looked pretty good here. So we decided to move here. And the most 
wonderful thing is the people that came to the shop were, "We are so glad you're here. Nobody has said, 
afc2020009_022—Lenore Gusten interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
24 
"What do you do for a day job?" We were just so bowled over by how accepting and welcoming they 
were to this different way of making a living. 
 
KC  45:34 
How's your shop always been in your home? 
 
LG  45:37 
Yes. Yeah, well, you know, kind of like outside the home [studio is in a small detached building behind 
their home.] The very first one, we had, we lived in an old house, and we have an extremely large 
laundry room. So we put our tables we sat back to back for the first year, year or so, before we took over 
half the garage and built a a real studio.  
 
LG  46:00 
And coming here, we told them that if, we had this convoluted, "Well, if the price doesn't include, if 
they do't have this, then subtract so much from what we're willing to spend, because we need to build a 
space for us to do this." And our real estate agent found this place with a whole building, so— 
 
KC  46:21 
Did it ever get touchy, being in business with your husband?  
 
LG  46:25 
Oh, yeah. [laughter] 
 
LG  46:31 
Yeah. Yeah. [laughter] 
 
JG  46:42 
No comment for the record?  
 
LG  46:44 
No comment for the record. I have one step son, he is 38. And he's recently moved to Arizona.  
afc2020009_022—Lenore Gusten interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
25 
 
JG  46:55 
So he, you didn't bring him up in the business?   
 
LG  46:58 
He, I mean, he knows it. It wasn't anything he was interested in. His artwork went a different direction. 
And I guess we wouldn't, we wouldn't push on that. He is a tattoo artist. Had his own shop until recently, 
because he moved. And he's just, he excels at what he does. He's found a way to incorporate all his 
artwork into a business. And that's all we ask is that he had to be true to who he was. He was always a 
little artist, when he was little, never stopped drawing. So if he could find a way for himself that he 
incorporates his art, we were happy. 
 
JG  47:36 
Thinking about this job in the time of the COVID pandemic, have you seen the types of things people 
bring in change as they go through their attics, or you know, has there been any difference in this past 
year and a half? 
 
LG  47:55 
Well, obviously, there was a little bit less until people kind of figured out what they could and couldn't 
do. And then, I also, more than half of my business, three quarters of our business comes from the 
Raleigh area. And I shut down going to Raleigh,. And, you know, that kind of held up things. But I don't 
know. It's the same stuff. Whether COVID caused them to clean out the attic, or figuring they had to 
downsize, did it? It really didn't. It didn't make as big a difference as I thought it would. 
 
JG  48:33 
That's interesting. It seems like different industries have been affected, at least people we've talked to. 
Some folks were like, "Oh, we were slammed." Some people had nothing, as you say, more or less 
steady, once you got back in.  
 
LG  48:46 
afc2020009_022—Lenore Gusten interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
26 
Yeah, I mean, I got people before, they'd call me, they didn't care that COVID was going on, they need 
to get it fixed. We, of course, always have the mail-in stuff from all over. So you know those folks are 
like "Perfect, I'm home I can mail a package. " So we really didn't. We just didn't feel under the gun to 
feel pressured. So we used that opportunity to revamp the studio since people weren't coming in.  
 
JG  49:16 
It's great. We should describe for the tape this beautiful studio with its painted koi pond floor. 
 
KC  49:24 
I love my colors in here. That turquoise with a real breaky red is one of my favorite combinations a 
mind to a question that we've been asking everybody because the variety of answers is so fun. Do you 
have a favorite tool to work with? 
 
LG  49:46 
You know, I saw that was one of your questions, and I think, because I have so many different steps, it 
would probably be per step. When I go to smooth out, we use a glass sand paper thats not easy to find, 
you definitely don't go down to the hardware store and find it, it's something we have to order. And it 
doesn't scratch the ceramic. And we've been using it for, gosh, more than 20 years. And we're just 
always amazed. It doesn't scratch the ceramic, it just, it's go to. We'd be lost if they ever gave up 
producing it. Other than that? My paint. My very small liner brushes, I can do almost anything with. 
 
KC  50:33 
Do you have a favorite brand of brush, or type of hair in the brush, or just? 
 
LG  50:38 
No, I'm just, you know, if it's the right size, I'll use it. Because I'm a bad brush parent, I guess. Because I 
just wear them right out. So I'm always buying new brushes. I use them the way they're not supposed to 
be used. I mash them, I cut them up, so.  
 
JG  50:59 
Is there anything else you'd like to share about your business or your experiences? 
afc2020009_022—Lenore Gusten interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
27 
 
KC  51:04 
Or questions you thought we would ask and we haven't yet? I forgot that we shared our list earlier. 
[laughs] 
 
LG  51:11 
Did what? 
 
KC  51:12 
I forgot that we shared our question list. Were there things you were expecting to discuss that we haven't 
covered, that you'd like to—? 
 
LG  51:20 
I think we covered everything, because I did do my prep. So I made sure that whatever I was saying, 
Yeah, they asked that question. They asked that question. I think I've answered almost all the questions 
you had on your list. 
 
KC  51:34 
Well, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us. 
 
LG  51:37 
Well, you're welcome. Thanks for inviting me to do this. It's a interesting project.  
 
KC  51:44 
Yes, I'll turn off the tape.
