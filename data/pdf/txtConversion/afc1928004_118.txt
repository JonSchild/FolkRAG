ADOLPIIOUS 1110.117.;IN GLORY 
I 
was born down in Virgi
,ny, 
Way down om de ole plantation; 
I 
blo ngs, 
00 :iee, 
Ti, tie cone] Utl population. 
I'm happy as de day is long, 
bull find I 
tell no story, 
And my name it is 
Adolphous Morninglory. 
As long as I 
possess my health, 
I 
always alit contented; 
Though often on my misfortunes 
lye commented. 
De wind might blow, de snow may fall, 
Make oder people worry— 
But it cannot hurt 
Adulphuus Morninglory. 
Before us niggers knew 
De meaning of Emancipation, 
We felt just twice as happy 
As creation. 
De bully times we'd ' fore de war, 
Now has gone to glory— 
Still I'm happy 
Adolphous Morninglory. 
SUNNY SIDE. 
I 
am one of those easy belles 
Well-known about, and so 
A fig for every petty wrong, 
For every petty woe. 
I 
laugh at witat the world calls Care, 
Am always gay and free; 
Look always on the brighter side, 
That is the style for me! 
CHORUS. 
Always gay and free girls, happy- as can be girls, 
That's the style for ute girls, always gay and free. 
When e'er I 
take my walks abroad, 
The gent's do at me stare; 
And whisper to each other: 
What eyes! and 1,11. what hair. 
What a 
jolly smile there's on her face, 
Whoever can she be, 
That looks so bewitching and 
Su frank, and yet so free. 
Always gay and free, &C.

DEW D'ANDIES. 
Wort.
Is by W M. IL DELEHANTY. 
Music by T. 
BRIGHAM BISHOP. 
Notir 
gaing to tell you all a 
little story, 
But I 
promise you I'll not detain you long; 
It's about a 
darling, charming, little sweet one, 
She's the captivating subject of my song. 
But. I'll tell you how we talked and how we flirted, 
When I 
met this belle; 
And ' twas then I 
called her little Dew D'Andies, 
For her name she would not tell. 
CHORUS. 
She's so sweet 
and so neat 
Oh I 
love the charming little Dew D'Andies, 
She's the sweetest girl that ever you did see, 
And she often sings me love among the roses. 
Now boys, she's just the girl for me. 
When I 
met her first ' mils out upon a 
pic-nic, 
And I 
shall never forget her winning smile, 
For she danced and made the changes in the music, 
With her graceful pretty fascinating smile. 
Then I 
asked her for her name and her directions, 
For I'd like to call, 
Then site turned around and whispered Dew D'Andies, 
And she smiling said 'twas all. 
She's so sweet, & c. 
So, now listen to the sequel of my story, 
For as time rolled on we dearer friends became ; 
And though yet I 
call her little Dew D'Andies, 
I 
am sure she's got another pretty name. 
I 
have placed a 
ring upon her taper finger, 
So we're one, life for life; 
A 
rid Rosy May my little Dew D'Andies, 
is my darling, charming wife. 
She's so sweet, <Lc.

MASSA'S IN THE COLD catourrn 
Round the meadows am a-ringing 
The darkies' mournful song, 
While the mocking-bird is singing, 
Happy as the day is long. 
Where the ivy is a- creeping 
O'er the grassy mound, 
There old m.issa is a 
sleeping, 
Sleeping in the cold, cold. ground. 
CHORUS. 
Down in the corn-field, 
Hear that mournful sound; 
All the darkies are a-weeping— 
Massa's in the cold, cold ground.. 
When the Autumn leaves were falling, 
When. the days were cold, 
iTwas hard to hear old massa calling, 
'Cause he was so weak and old. 
Now the orange tree is blooming 
On the sandy shore; 
Now the Summer days are coming, 
Massa never calls no more 
Down in the corn-field, &c-
Massa made the darkies love him, 
He always was so kind, 
Now, they sadly weep above him, 
Mourning: for, he leave them behind. 
I 
cannot work before to-morrow, 
So many tear- drops flow; 
I 
try to drive away my sorrow, 
ricking on the old banjo.

Down on the Mississippi floating, 
Long time I

All night de cotton wood a

Sing for my true lub all de way. 
Now I'm unhappy and I'm weeping, 
Can't tote de cotton wood no more: 
Last night, while Nelly was a-sleeping, 
Death came a-knocking at de door. 
When I 
saw my Nelly in de morning, 
Smile till she opened up her eyes, 
Seemed like de light of day a 
dawning, 
Jist ' fore de sun begin to rise. 
Close by de margin of de water, 
Whar de lone weeping willow grows, 
Dar libh'd Virginny's lubly daughter, 
Dar she in death may find repose. 
Down in de meadow 'mong de clober, 
Walk wid my Nelly by my side, 
Now all dem happy days am ober,

ADOLIDHUS BLUE JAY. 
They call me Dolly Blue Jay, 
I 
sing and dance the whole day, 
And never seem to tire while in the motion; 
The people often say 
I'd make clear a 
cloudy day, 
With my song and dance, when I'm in the notion. 
CHORUS. 
And I'm now as happy as happy can be, 
I'm going to remain so all the day; 
Now wait just a 
moment, and the motion you shall see, 
Of happy, Adolphus Blue Jay. 
My spirit is as light as the air, 
I 
give no thought to care, 
'Cause " neither rich nor poor" is Dolly Blue Jay; 
Bliss Simmons gave a 
bow 
As I 
passed by her just now, 
And she whispered to her friend that's Dolly Blue Jay. 
And I'm now as happy, ctc. 
With the girls I'm quite a 
swell, 
'Cause I 
dress both neat and well, 
And I 
think of making some one Mrs. Blue Jay; 
I'll go to Simmons, house to-night, 
And I 
think you'll say I'm right, 
, 
In asking " 011ie" to be mistress Blue Jay. 
And I'm now as happy, drc.

sat myself down on the seat by her side, 
She blushed, and endeavored her sweet face to hide ; 
She a 
course, left off singing, and tried all she could 
To keep the dear child quiet, but it would not be goed 
I 
thought this a 
first rate excuse just to speak, 
And my doing so brought a 
fresh blush to each cheek, 
As I 
begged she'd repeat -what I'd just heard her sing. 
For the dear little babe's sake : and it proved just the thing. 
Spoken.---1Tor, strange to tell, the little darling was soothed di-
rectly it heard her silvery voice sing— Pat- a-cake, ez..e. 
We soon became friendly, as you may suppose, 
I 
fell plump on my knees. and there did propose, 
That we should be wed, for on that I 
was bent : 
She replied she'd be willing if " Papa would consent 1' 
So I 
called on her papa, a 
baker by trade, 
Who had not long retired with the money he'd made; 
He gave his consent and his blessing beside, 
And in a 
month from that day I 
made her my bride. 
Spoken.—And why dayou think he consented ? 
Because he dis-
covered I 
was musical, and was tlkerefore just the youth to become 
his son-in-law—son-ir-law ti a 
baker I 
ecstatic idra! 
A musical 
baker, with a 
voice of exactly ono octave register from Do to Do I 
and didn't he rub his hands with delight when he heard me sing— 
Pat-a-cake, &c. 
I 
have been married a 
year and a 
week or two more, 
I 
feel—oh, so hap y I 
nc'er felt before! 
I 
feel I 
could fly if I 
only had wings, 
For I've lately been blessed with a 
pair of odd twins. 
A 
boy like his papa, and a 
girl like her mamma, 
And they'll both soon be able to sing out loud tatta, 
And I'm going to teach them, all in good time, 
This very old-fashioned nursery rhyme. 
Spoken.—Fancy ale a 
patient of a 
little male cherub on this 
side, and a 
wee female cherub on this side— fat:cy six in the morn-
ing,! this one aa-akes, pats my face, tiekles my nose, and says with 
its little childish treble, " pap, pa-a-a;" the ono on this side repeats 
the operation, varying it only by saying. " dad, (la-a-a," I 
open my 
eyes and say—" W 
hat, my pretties ;" they reply by placing their tiny 
little hands together in this fashion, and singing— Pat-a-cake, &c.

ANGEL'S WHISPER. 
A. baby was sleeping, 
Its mother was weeping, 
For her husband was far o'er the wide raging 
And the tempest was swelling, 
• 
Round the fisherman's dwelling, 
And she cried: " Dermot darling, oh! come back to not* 
Her beads while she numbered, 
The baby still slumber'd, 
And smiled in her face while she bended her knee; ' 
Oh! blessed be that warning, 
My child, thy sleep adorning; 
For I 
know that the angels are whispering to thee. 
And while they are keeping 
Bright watch o'er thy sleeping, 
Oh! pray to them safely, my babe, with me, 
And say thou would rather 
They'd watch o'er thy father! 
For I 
know that the angels are whispering to thee. 
The morn of the morning 
Saw Dermot returning, 
And the wife wept with joy the babe's father to see, 
And closely caressing 
The child with a 
blessing, 
Said: I 
knew that the angels were whispering to there 
AGGIE ASHTORE. 
Oh! blessings forever on Aggie Ashtore / 
She's good as she's lovely and twenty times more; 
With her sparkling blue eyes and her eloquent smile, 
Oh! the hearts of the hardest tis she can beguile. 
Aggie dear, 
Aggie dear, 
Oh! blessings forever on her I 
adore! 
For she's good as she's lovely, my Aggie Ashtere. 
The first time we met ' twas at our village fair,. 
And the prettiest girls of the country were there 
But ne'er did I 
see, either sinee or before, 
One fit to compare with Aggie Asht,oro; ' 
Aggie dear, 
Aggie deer, 
Then blessings forever on her I 
adore 
Fer she's as good as s'ho'e kively, my Agee A,ebtore.

CLAR. DE ri.iTCHEIN. 
In old Kentuck, in de arteriloon, 
We sweep de lb

And arter dat we form a

And dis de snag dat we do sing. 
Chonus.—O, dare de ki tchen, old folks, young folks, 
Clare th, kitchen. old folks, young folks, 
Old Virginity never tire. 
I

couldn't get across, 
I'd nobody wid nie but an old blind horse; 
But Old Jim Crow came riding by, 
Says he, - Old fellow, your horse will die." 
Its ciare de kitchen, Sze. 
My horse fell down upon de spot, 
Says he, •• Unit you see his eyes is sot ?" 
So I 
took out my knife, and off wid his s,in, 
And when he comes to hie 
ride hint agin. 
So elsre de kitchen, & c. 
A 
jayliird sot on a 
hickory limb— 
Ile wink'd at me, and I 
wink'd at him; 
I 
pick'd up a 
stone and I 
hit his shin— 
Says he, " You better not do dat agin." 
So dare de kitchen, &c. 
A bull- frog dress'd in soger's close, 
Went in do field to shoot some crows; 
De crows smell powder and fly away— 
De bull-frog mighty mad dat day. 
So dare de kitchen, &c. 
Den down I 
went wid Cato Moore 
To see de steamboat come ashore; 
Every man for himself, so I

" 
Let off," said de captain, " or I 
burn you w

And dare de kitchen, & c.

She wears a

And when she walks de streets in °and, 
De hollow of her foot wake a

Now clare de kitchen, & o. 
Dis love is a 
ticklish ting. you know,

lubly flat nose. 
So clare de kitchen, &c. 
"Go way." says she, " wid your cowcumber shin,

DIS AN WHAT I DID 
White folks, you attention 
I 
ask a 
while of you: 
I 
feel so loose and careless, 
That. I 
don't no what to do; 
I 
felt so g•ood this morning, 
Down the stairs 1 
slid. 
Wh en t 
hey 
11 ,,,k ed 
the wlmt the matter was? 
Why, dis atit what I 
did. 
When I 
first came to this city, 
The folks they dressed so neat, 
All in the height of fashion, 
From their head down to their feet; 
I 
went into an auction store, 
And for dese shoes did bid ; 
When dey told me to lay down de cash, 
Why, dis am what I 
did. 
BRIGHT EYES FOR DIE. 
My pretty little daisy, 
She nearly drivt.s me crazy, 
Well briglit blue eyes all men surprise, 
Like dew drops on a 
daisy ; 
By a 
Queen I 
in lov'd as you know, 
Her name it is Queen Juno, 
My little heart fr,on her won't part 
She's such a 
lovely girl. 
CHORUS. 
Oh a 
pair of bright eyes are the thing for me, 
And we know they are such pretty things to see, 
When we are married oh how happy we shall be, 
Among the upper ten how envied I 
shall be. 
Reposing on the fib xers, 
Near the celestial bowers, 
I 
was made to start by Cupid's dart 
And thro' a 
golden shower, 
While feigning to be sleeping 
I 
saw my Juno peeping, 
'Mid the sunlit skies her bright blue eyes 
Said mortal I 
love you. 
Oh a 
pair. tkc. 
NELLY IS WAITING FOR THEE. 
The voice of the birds singing sweetly, 
The gent,e breeze whispering low, 
Seem anxious to tell, oh, bow fondly, 
Some one is expectin
, you now; 
Some one is patiently watching, 
Under the trystiug, tree, 
Wondering when you are coming, 
Some one is waiting for thee. 
CHORUS. 
Down in the meadow she's waiting, under the trysting tree, 
Down in the meadow she's waiting, Nelly is waiting for thee. 
Why do you thus keep delaying, 
Surely you seem to forget, 
Some one is waiting to see you, 
\\There you s') often have met. 
Wearily watching and waiting, 
Anxiously wishing to see 
The form of her lover approaching, 
Some one is waiting for thee. 
Down in the meadow, dre.

DEAR KITTY GRAY. 
One morn through a 
village church yard I 
did stray, 
I 
met a 
fair creature, she looked so gay, 
Her eyes shone like diamonds, her teeth white as pearl, 
Her cheeks were like roses, her hair hung in curls ; 
I 
stepped up to her and stood by her side, 
I 
said, " My sweet maiden, will you be my bride I" 
She said, " Come to my mother if you mean what you say." 
She looked like an angel, my own Kitty Gray. 
She looked like an angel, altho' she was poor, 
That sweet charming creature I 
ne .er shall see more; 
From her poor mother I 
led her astray, 
She is gone, she is dead, now my poor Kitty Gray. 
To her mother's poor cottage, I 
then did repair, 
Their sweet morning meal with me they did share, 
Her father was dead, in the wars he was slain, 
When they told me their sad tale, it caused them much pain. 
I 
said I 
would befriend her poor mother through life, 
And make her sweet charming daughter my wife, 
Her mother consented to what I 
did say. 
1 
deceived and degraded my poor Kitty Gray. 
She looked like an angel, & c. 
To London I 
brought her in a 
carriage and pair, 
I 
dressed her in jewels and satins as rare, 
She found I 
deceived her and left her alone, 
With her babe at her breast in the wild world to roam. 
I 
took her p, 
or heart and cast her aside, 
The babe and its mother they both sunk and died. 
Like many poor girls that has been led astray, 
By a 
flattering deceiver, like poor Kitty Gray. 
She looked like an angel, & e.

CLARA SANE. 
I 
knew a 
nook by the river's brink, 
Where the sunlight loved to stray, 
And the waters laughed as they hurried on, 
To their rest in the quiet bay. 
'Twas there I 
spent such happy hours. 
As ne'er will come again, 
And there my timid heart confessed, 
Its love for Clara Kane. 
CHORUS. 
But now the sun shines cheerless there, 
The river laughs no more, 
For darling Clara sleeps in death, 
Upon its leafy shore. 
One summer's eve she whispered low 
" 
Oh ! draw the curtains by, 
And let me see our cherished bower. 
Again before I 
die I" 
And then her gentle spirit fled, 
For ever freed from pain ; 
But still I 
love that river nook, 
For the sake of Clara Kane. 
And though in mournful silence bound 
The river laughs no more, 
I 
sit and weep by Clara's grave, 
Upon its leafy shore.

And he never had his bealth, -

Ile was suhject to all sorts of ills,

And tonight a 
box of vegetable pills. 
Oh, he took twenty four, and then he went to bed, 
And soon was fast asleep;

Very much to his surprise, 
lie was turned into a 
great big beet. 
The old woman was tackled 
With a 
pain in her head, 
Anil she sent for her darling son, 
Said she, " Go get me that very box of pills, 
I 
think that I 
will take some; 
And then she get worse, 
So they sent for the nurse, 
For she'd taken a 
very big number. 
When she looked in the glass, 
She was just as green as grass, 
She had turned into a 
big cucumber. 
One night the old man, 
R e got -very tight. 
And he felt so VOI'y (
peer, 
lie thought he would try 
A small dose of pills, 
In a 
pint of lager beer.

Then about a 
dozen more, 
Which made him feel forlorn, 
When lie sat right down, 
And his head flopped around, 
He had turned into a 
big car of corn. 
The little pussy, kitten cat, 
Was looking fer a 
rat, 
And site spied I 
he box of pills 
She looked all areend, 
Then she gf,oblileil them down, 
Sht' thought ' t 
would cure her ills. 
Then the fun begun. 
When the cat began to run. 
From the cellar clear up into the garret, 
Her body was turned right into sour kraut, 
And her tail into a 
great big carrot! 
MORAL, 
For if yon do. 
You anrelv it will me, 
And think bow strange it seems, 
How funny yon would look, 
All strung up on a 
hook. 
And turued tight into beans.

WHERE'S MY DOLLY GONE.—NcNcLuDED.1 
Now fust we elinil)el the Monvement, 
(Them stairs be'atit there a 
load!) 
Then we went to the Cristial Palace, 
What's down in the Whitt:chapel Road; 
And then tlio British Museum too, 
What stands on nitnrose Hill, 
And then we seed some waxworks : 
Of sights we had our fill. 
Spoken-Aye. did'ot Dolly like them there waxworks. all alive, opened 
their eyes quite natural. There was dir. Richard the Third talking to 
Tropnum, and Lord John Briyht walking arm in arm with Guy Fawkes, 
and there was lack .S7upphard a-taking tea with Q2 
W17. Elizabeth, and Ma-
bel Gray a-playity4 dolaillOeti Wi 11 the Prince qf Wales; didn't we laugh I 
but now I'm molloncholly for- Clio. 
Next we seed the Buckingham Pallis, 
And there we seed the Queen 
A-sitting at the winder, yes, 
And looking all serene ; 
And next we took a 
Blackwall boat 
And went to see the 
Zoo," 
The animiles, the erockcydiles, 
And the roaring cockatoo. 
Spoken-Yes, the roaring cockatoo's a 
feroshus animile, wears his tail 
under his tat ear and eats two men and a 
boy for breakfast every morn-
ing; then we seed the giraffe with a 
neck about three yards long-mum't 
mffer when Al has a 
sore throae if 
How we did Larf, but now rna 
wretched for-Cuo. 
Next we went to see " Formosa," 
Up in the gal-le-ry, 
My Dolly said 'twits " touching," 
And soon begins to cry; 
When we come out the crowd it squeezed, 
Forget it I 
ne'er shall, 
And when I 
comes to look around, 
I 
couldn't find my gal. 
S'poken-Couldn't see her nowheres. T 
cl1ed " Dolly," then another chap 
eallod " Dolly," nal num everyhely celled -• 
Doily;" one chap said she'd 
been taken up for stealing pigeon's milk, another chap said she'd eloped 
with a 
horse marine. nub a 
rrliceman said he could swear he saw my 
Daly hanging outsitk a 
rag shop.—Cuo. 
I 
know my Dolly's faithful, 
I 
know Inv Dolly's true ; 
If I 
don't find my Dolly soon, 
Whatever shall I 
do 
When I 
gets back to Devonshire, 
I'll end my miseree, 
I'll hang myself for Dolly's loss, 
Upon a 
gooseberry tree.—GioRus.

NIP UP. 
As I 
walked out one morning, ' twas in the afternoon, 
The snow was falling very fast, ' twas in the month of June; 
I 
overheard a 
damsel, and unto inc (lid say : 
Fare you well my Nicky, it's I'm a 
going away. 
CHORUS. 
Nip up, nip up, come along with me, nip up, nip up, come along 
with me, 
Nip up, 
ip up, come along with me, I'll take you down the river 
on the K. Y. K. 
Jackson was a 
general, commanded a 
hundred thousand million of 
Men, 
He marched them up the bill my boys, and he marched them down 
again ; 
When they were up, they were up, my boys, and when they were 
down, they were down, 
And when they were half ways up, my boys, they were neither up 
nor down. 
Nip up, & c. 
I 
wish I 
was a 
sea pig, I'd roam this world o'er and o'er, 
I'd go in search of my true love, I 
wonder where he is ? I 
don't know; 
Or if I 
was an eagle, I'd fly this world through and through, 
I'd go and find my own true love, that was killed in the battle of Bull 
Run. 
Nip up, & c. 
HANNAH MARIA. 
Good eve, white folks, one and all, come listen to my rhyme, 
I 
hope it will please you, if you can spare the time; 
It's all about a 
nice young girl, her hair was red as fire, 
She rail away, a 
month to-day, aid her name was Hannah Maria. 
CHORUS. 
She ran away, a 
month to-day, I 
don't know where to find her, 
She is left handed iu both feet and her name is Hannah Maria. 
I 
went to her lmose one afternoon about the hour of two, 
What I 
saw there, I 
do declare, I 
sin ashamed to tell to you; 
There WAS a man all in the mom a 
sitting by the tire, 
lic had his arms around her waist a- squeezing Hannah Maria. 
She ran awa, &c. 
My 
p • ssion then I 
could not hold, in that you'll say I 
was right, 
But to my disrrost, it's I 
found out that he was on the ti 
lit ; 
I 
seized the wretch right by the throat to throw him in the fire, 
lie knocked me down and black'd my eyes— ran off with Hannah 
Maria. 
She ran away, &c.

Oh where, oh where, 
Can all the music be, 
Falling on my ear, 
Floating in the air ? 
Or, are the angels 
Singing love to me, 
'Bout Miss Susie Dean, 
The apple of my eye.

When no one else was nigh,

The apple of my eye. 
It fills my soul 
With joy and ecstacy; 
The memory is so sweet, 
Of when we first did meet. 
The sweetest fruit, 
That ripens on a

With Susie can't compete, 
The apple of my eye.

"THE RIVAL MUSICIANS." 
Ill tell you of a 
loving youth, 
Who deep in love did fall, 
With a 
gushing maid of forty-five, 
Who was wrinkled, spare and tall. 
He used to play the double bass, 
And he was mad, you bet I 
When he found he had a 
rival 
Who played the clarionet. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, they were a 
pretty pair, 
As ever yet was seen ; 
He'd play her gentle music 
On his double bass machine. 
They'd walk out in the moonlight, 
And love stories he'd relate, 
And serenade at evening, 
Or ' neath her window wait, 
But the clarionet man was crafty, 
His hair was fiery red, 
He made this damsel promis 
That only he she'd wed 
When the " Double

will that evening, 
he did decide, 
led into his double bass, 
there he calmly died. 
Yes, they were, (tc 
he clarionet man was very elad, 
For now he'd claim his bride, 
He blowed so hard that evening 
He Wowed himself cross-eyed. 
Every night a 
form is seen 
With spectacles on his face, 
Playing funeral marches 
On his ghostly double bass, 
Yes, they were, & c, 
"ALABAMA JOE." 
Oh, I 
once aid know a 
lovely girl, 
ALd I 
thought that she loved me, 
Her name was Liz°, she'd coal black eyes, 
And none could dance like she. 
I 
courted her for seven long years, 
And fi,und it was no go, 
When I 
found out she'd ran away 
With Alabama Joe. 
cnont.TS. 
But in spite of that I 
often think about her. 
My heart is sad since she has gone away, 
But what's the use to grieve, for in that I 
don't believe, 
I'm a 
happy darkey bound to be gay. 
I 
used to take her to all the balls, 
And all the sights in town, 
And everything that she did want 
Of course I 
handed it down ; 
But when the ball was over, 
And the folks began to go, 
She left me standing like a 
stick, 
And away she went with Joe. 
But in spite of that, & c. 
Now my Lize bas left me, 
And she's gone far away, 
And when she did skedaddle 
She took my heart away; 
But if ever she comes back again, 
Oh, married we will be, 
And then I'd like to see some " Nig." 
Take that gal from me. 
But in spite of that, & c,

Oh I 
you may talk of Lizzie Ann, 
And the charming gay quadroon ; 
They cannot beat the girl I 
met, 
The other afternoon. 
Her roguish eyes threw such a 
glance, 
And she gave a 
killing smile; 
Her jockey hat tipp'd on her nose, 
Oh ! golly, ain't she style. 
CHORUS. 
She's dashing when she walks the streets, 
And then her killing smile; 
The jockey hat tipp'd on her nose, 
Oh I 
golly, ain't she style. 
Her cheeks are red as any rose, 
And her lucious lips are sweet ; 
You'll know her by that saucy smile, 
Whene'er you chance to meet. 
You'll not find such another girl, 
If you go many a 
mile; 
Her dress it is surpassed by none, 
Ohl golly, ain't she style. 
She's dashing, etc. 
Last night I 
told her of my love, 
And I 
said, " will you be mine 7' 
I 
told her I'd be at the church, 
Just, as the clock struck nine. 
I 
met her, she was oressed to kill, 
And she wore that saucy smile;

heard them say, 
Oh I

And he will no longer wait, 
And we'll come and see you all another day.

NEVER (31-0 BACK ON YOUR WORD, 
Oh, white folks, 
sing you a 
ditty-. 
If you will listen to my little song, 
And if it don't please it's a 
pity, 
And I 
promise to not keep you long, 
The subject of my song it is wholesome, 
The music no doubt you have heard, 
And I 
promised to sing you a 
new one, 
And I'll never go back on my word,-
There was Old Hickory Jackson, 
At the battle of New Orleans, 
It was there be gave General Packenhara 
The best of his good Yankee beans, 
lie says now boys we must whip them, 
And he looked at his trusty old sword,. 
He gave them gunpowder and cotton, 
And Ile did not go back on his word 
In the days of the old revolution, 
Or in the days of old seventy-six-, 
Our country was in a 
commotion, 
And the British were playing dirty tricks, 
W e sent for a 
man for to help us, 
To drive off that tyrannical horde, 
George Washington said be would do it, 
And he never went back on his word. 
ELLA IS MY STYLE.

And gaze upon the fashion,

They greet me with a 
smile, 
But non o among them pleases me, 
For Ella is my style.

She is so gayly dressed, 
She's my sweetness, she's my peach, 
When on me she throws a 
smile ; 
There is no one to match her, 
For Ella is my style. 
The first time that I 
met her, 
It was at a 
promenade, 
Th4- moon was shining brightly, 
Twas then I 
made a 
raid. 
I 
asked her quite politely 
If I 
night see her home ; 
She smiled on me and took my arm. 
And then we walked along. 
To see her, tte. 
I 
told her that I 
loved her, 
And married we would be ; 
S. in our best we quickly dressed, 
lire parson quick to see; 
And now she's my darling little 
Sine greets ore with a 
smile; 
There is no One to match her, 
For Ella is my style, 
To see her, Aic.

SOME EIGHTY YEARS AGO. 
White folks your attention now, I'm going to sing a 
song, 
I 
hope it will please you, and I 
won't detain you long; 
Everything was on the square, it's then we made no show, 
We had no Grecian bends, my boys, some eighty years ago. 
We had no fast horses then for to make them fly, 
And men that had a 
red moustache, they did not use hair dye ; 
We had Champagne then, no cider stuff, for ilutobug all the 
go, 
We had no molasses whisky, boys, some eighty years ago. 
We had no hundred dollar shawls, no bonnets trimmed with 
lace, 
Nor twenty different kinds of paint to make a 
pretty face ; 
We had no brass watch chains then, for gold was all the go, 
We had no dollar jewelry some eighty years ago. 
Some eighty years ago the country it was right, 
The Union then was not dissolved by a 
general fight ; 
But let us all unite again, we will let the world all know, 
That Uncle Sam is just as good as some eighty years ago.

DARLING NARY JANE. 
White folks rn sing a 
song, it's neither old or new, 
But while I 
pick the Banj ,) 
strings I'll bawl it out to you, 
Its all about and just because I 
love, but all in vain, 
A 
gal that weighed three hundred pounds and her name was 
Mary Jane. 
She was as handsome as a 
hollyhock, her beauty I'll expose, 
She had onion eyes, and carroty hair and a 
lovely, turn up 
nose, 
Ch had a 
gumbile on the end, it looked in shape mid form 
Like a 
strawberry struck with lightning just after a 
thunder 
storm. 
Her hair it was a 
lovely red, you couldn't help admire, 
When she gut mad it rose right up just like a 
blaze of fire, 
She dressed it in the latest style, the waterfall it's called, 
She wears it on the top of her head to cover a 
place that's 
bald. 
I 
would not care not half so much now if my love was slain, 
By any other feminine except my Mary Jane; 
But if ever I 
catch the cllat soup man 
bounce him like a 
ball, 
I'll pin his ears to the back of his Leek aud swadow him bouts 
and all. 
DOWN BY THE RIVER SIDE I 
STRAY. 
Down by the river side I 
stray, 
As twilight shadows close, 
And the soft music of the spray, 
Lulls nature to repose. 
Beside the stream a 
maiden dwells, 
My star of even-tide, 
Pure as the water lilly bells, 
Down by the river side. 
CHORUS. 
Pure as the water lilly bells 
Pure as the water lilly bel 
Pure as the waters lilly bells, 
Down by the river side. 
Down by the river side I 
own, 
A 
treasure worth the sea, 
A 
one to all the world unknown, 
Who's all the world to me. 
Soon in her early bloom and glow, 
She is to be my bride, 
Pere as the water Idly bells, 
Down by the river side. 
Pure as the water lilly bells, 
Pure as the water lilly bells, 
Pure as the water idly bells, 
Down by the river side.

HIGH TIMES IN THE KITCHEN. 
Oh, the Yankees played the debil way down in Dixy, 
Old Masssa took the gals and run away, 
And they played the very dickens 
around in that vicinity, 
Old massa gave the darkies holiday. 
CHORUS. 
High times, good times, down in massa's Kitchen, 
The darkies they gain seven pounds a 
day, 
Filakey, hihtkey, bilakey, hoo, I 
am bound to be. a 
general, 
At least so all the Yankee soldiers say. 
Like Daniel in the lion's den, you will see them in the menage-
rie, 
And the darkies there encompassed all around, 
And when the bugle sounded w 
by high, low, jack for liberty, 
And the wenches to the frolic they were bound. 
High times, good times, down in massa's Kitchen, 
The darkies they gain seven p(nnds a 
clay, 
hilakey, bilakey, hoc), I 
am bound to be a 
general, 
At least .so all the Yankee soldiers say. 
Now the war is over and there is peace down in Dixy, 
The ni ,ger he is better than before, 
But he will hoe the corn and bake the cake, 
And wait for angel Gabriel to sound him to Canaan's happy 
shore. 
High times, good times., ttc. 
FLY LITTLE BUNCH OF ROSES. 
Words and Music by Wm. U. DELEHANTY. 
I 
am waiting here to meet my darling 
And my heart 
i
s n a 
flutter of delight; 
For we kissed last night when we were parting, 
And this is where she bid inc come to- night. 
When away from her I 
am so lonely, 
I 
know not what to do ; 
lint her bright, sweet smile can ever cheer me, 
Her heart is warm and true. 
Oh I 
When we kissed then I 
saw her pretty blushes, 
She turned her lace away the blush to bide; 
I 
was happy with my bunch of roses. 
My little bunch of roses by my side. 
CHORUS. 
There is something that I 
mnst not tell, 
And that is where this maid does dwell, 
In her hair she wears a 
white cairn:Ha, 
And a 
dark blue is the color of her eyes. 
And I 
call her toy little bunch of roses, 
My darling, charming, captivating prize. 
It was in those happy days of childhood, 
When first I 
met this roguish little belle ; 
I3y a 
streamlet running through the wild wood, 
Though but a 
boy, in love with her I 
fell. 
She is now the pride of all the city, 
Of Summers sweet sixteen, 
And is called by all a 
perfect beauty, 
A fawn- like, fairy queen. 
Oh ! 
Now I 
meet her almost every evening, 
And I 
think it is the sweetest thing in life; 
For to walk with the dower of my affection, 
Especially when she's soon to be thy wife. 
There is something, ezc, 
'Twas an evening when the moon was shining 
The little stars were twinkling far above ; 
Arm -
in-arm we were walking in the garden, 
'Twas there and then we both revealed our love. 
So I 
asked her then if she wou:d take me, 
For better or for worse; 
When she smiled on me so very swe, fly, 
And answered, ' Yes, of course.' Ohl 
I 
confess that I 
never was so happy, 
Nor do I 
think that ever I 
could be; 
Till I've married my little bunch of ruses, 
With a 
little bunch of restos on my kneel 
There is something, Ace. 
GET ALONG OLD MULE. 
0, the time's done gone when massa used to say: 
Turn out, Pompey, at the break of .day— 
flurry down the hoe-cake and shoulder the hoe, 
And over the creek to the cane field go. 
For now I'm free as the bird in the air. 
This corn-patch is mine. 'and the little cabin there; 
And Chloe and the children all belong to me, 
And this child's happy as happy can be. 
Get along, old mule; touch him up, John— 
Corn is in the crib and chicken's in the. stew. 
Get along, old mule, get along on, 
Plowing in the field where the sugar cane grew. 
Old driver came one night to my cabin door, 
Hungry and weary, faint and sore ; 
Jenny brought him water while Kitty got a 
chair, 
And Chloe brought a 
corn-cake and gave it to him there 
And old massa's s 
rroa s 
have whi ened o'er his head, 
All his loved ones are gone to the valley of the dead; 
They sleep where the honey- flower feeds the wild bee, 
Under the shade of the cotton-wood tree 
Get along, itc. 
0, sad times are gone—may they never come again, 
For heavy was the trouble or the poor slave then ; 
Now I've money in the pocket, and plenty in the store, 
And what can a 
happy man ask for more? 
The days pass a 
aqty full of peace and delight, 
In the labors of the field or the dreams of the night. 
And sweets thoughts wander through my ev ning prayer. 
As the children kneel around the old man's chair. 
Get along, & c. 
MISSISSIPPI BOAT SONG. 
Some boats are fast and others slow, 
Stern-wheet boats on the Ohio. 
'With five feet scant on all the bars, 
This boat can beat the railroad cars. 
Now is the time for a 
bully trip, 
So shake her up and let her rip I 
CHORUS. 
Now is the time for a 
bully trip, 
Hudah, hutlah, hudah hay, 
So, shake her up an' let her rip 
Hudak, hudalt, hudah hay— 
With five feet scant on all the bars, 
This boat, can beat the railroad cars. 
Our boys they all do like this fun, 
'Tis not the first time that we've run. 
Our captain bets on every race, 
And when he drinks he runs his face. 
I 
saw him bet ten thousand down 
With Captain Joe, in Orleans town. 
Now is the time, & C. 
So crowd her hard with pitch and pine. 
The other boat's ten miles behind, 
Telegraph wires are mighty slow, 
And our safety valves are tied below. 
I 
bet my mo..ey, and I'm bound to win, 
And fill thy pockets full of tin. 
Now is the time, Ltc.

Music by Rows Ilowano. 
The sweetest one in all the world, 
I 
chanced (Inc day to meet ; 
My heart went with this little " Belle," 
The Queen of Chestnut street. 
A dainty glove by chance she droppd, 
It seemed all done by fate; 
pick'd it tip, " meet me," she said, 
On Sunday eve at eight 
CHORUS. 
Oh 1 
how my heart did palpitate, 
As I 
lingered near the gate, 
She's the fairest one in all the town, 
Some day she'll be my bride, 
I 
never can forget the day, 
I 
first walked by her side. 
Then Sunday evening came and I 
On the corner did wait; 
Where soon she met me and we walk'd, 
Thro' the park until quite late. 
We whisper'd words so low and sweet, 
For she's my darling " Kate," 
We said good night to meet again, 
On Sunday eve at eight. 
Oh! how, & e. 
At a 
ball we went and by my side, 
Was my dariin,g fond and true ; 
We danced and spoke of the future bright, 
Site said, " I 
love but you." 
I 
asked her to become my bride, 
As I 
lingered near the gate ; 
She whispered, .` Yes, when will it be e 
"Next Sunday eve at eight." 
Oh how, & e.

I 
once did lob a

And I

But such a

But she has proved incosistant, 
And left me here to tell, 
The sorrows (lot my heart do feel 
For deceitful Sarah Bell.

Cheer up, Sam, 
And don't let your spirits go down, 
Dere's many a

I 
had no gold to give her, 
And all I 
had I 
gave, 
For wealth or riches don't belong 
To one dot's born a 
slave. 
The white man came and took her, 
She went with him to dwell, 
And broke the vows and promises, 
Of perjured Sarah Bell. 
Cheer up, Sam, tic. 
One day as I 
was working, 
And hoeing down the corn, 
I 
sighed and wished within me, 
I 
neber had been born. 
Perhaps she's gay and happy, 
Whereher she may dwell, 
While dis poor heart lies breaking, 
For de loss of Sarah Bell.

And those who always wrote, now write the more."
