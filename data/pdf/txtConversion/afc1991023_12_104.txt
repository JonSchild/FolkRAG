TXO1: These photographs were taken at the annual decoy festival 
in G—Tuckerton; 47GT on the afternoon of Saturday, October 9. 
The 
festival consisted of a variety of display tables, all types of 
which are represented in the photographs. 
For more information 
on the festival, refer to PFP83—FTC1009. 
More photographs from 
the festival can be found on PFP83—CTC002. 
The artifacts in the 
photographs on this log may be grouped into three distinct 
categories: 
1) 
Old—style working decoys, carved by New Jersey, 
Barnegat Bay area—carvers between 1880 and 1950. 
These are 
represented in photographs 1-8; 2) 
Contemporary decorative 
wildfowl carvings, intended primarily for display, more self— 
concious artistic intent on the part of the carver. 
These are 
represented in photographs 9-14; 
3) 
Miscellaneous items of a 
popular nature bearing motifs derived from a maritime 
environment. 
These are represented in photographs 15-16.

Unfinished duck carving, showing pencil 
lines indicating 
where carver will 
incise feathers. 
In rear are two finished 
carvings mounted on wall plaques. 
10: 
Detail of #09, showing decoratively carved mallard mounted 
on plaque 
11: 
Canada Goose, carved from cork and hand painted. 
This could 
be used as a working decoy, but this one was carved as a display 
item 
12: 
Decoy with cork body and pine head, unfinished. 
As with the 
goose in photograph #11, this 
is referred to as a working decoy, 
but decoys of this type are primarily sold as decorative items. 
However, both this decoy and the goose in #11 can be grouped with 
photographs 01-08. 
13: 
Decorative decoys. 
Note that they are more naturalistic and

more brightly colored than the decoys in #s 1-8. 
The retention 
of the descriptive term "decoy" for this kind of carving is 
interesting, but not especially appropriate. 
14: 
Another view of the table depicted in #13, this time 
incorporating wall—plaque carvings. 
15: 
Painted brick door stoppers. 
Note the predominance of 
maritime motifs and the introduction of a farmscape in winter. 
Also, painted sand dollars

TXO1: These photographs continue the documentation of the 
Tuckerton Decoy Festival as begun in PFP83—CTCOOI. 
As with the 
first group, these too may be analyzed into several distinct 
categories. 
Slides 1-2 represent display tables set up for 
information purposes primarily; slides 3-17 are old working 
decoys carved in the Barnegat Bay area; slides 18-21 depict 
decoys that may be employed in duck hunting, but will probably be 
sold to people who wish to display them in their homes, or 
perhaps on their lawns; slides 22-24 represent more decorative 
decoys intended for display purposes only, and models of 
sneakboxes, also intended for display; 
slides 25-27 depict full— 
size artifacts intended for use. 
01: 
The New Jersey Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife display 
stand. 
There were photographs and literature pertaining to the 
mission of the Division, and someone was on hand all day to 
answer questions. 
02: 
The Pinelands Cultural Society display stand. 
Note the 
bumper stickers, the pins, and the cookbook, "Chicken Foot Soup", 
all 
of which are for sale. 
The Society was formed to preserve 
and promulgate Pinelands culture, and an 
important part of their 
activity as a group centers around fund raising.

Parker.

of decoy, by which the stool was attached to the duck hunter's 
gunning rig. 
15: 
Canada Goose, a working decoy carved by Willis Johnson, a 
Barnegat Bay area carver. 
This decoy has aroused some interest 
because of the carved tail feathers, which is a style usually 
employed in the Delaware River region further south, but is not 
found in Barnegat Bay decoys. 
16: 
Detail of #15, showing carved tail feathers 
17: 
Front view of #15 
18: 
Unpainted shore birds for sale. 
Although these carvings 
could be stuck in the sand to 
lure passing birds, they will 
probably be used for decorative purposes. 
Note that all of these 
carvings are mounted on stands, which signals "display." 
19: 
Painted cork decoys for sale. 
As with the carvings depicted 
in #18, these decoys will probably not be put to work, although 
note the keels on bottom, a sure sign that they could be 
functional. 
20: 
Another view of table depicted in #19 
21: 
Decorative wildfowl carvings. 
The sign classifies them as 
"Stool Duck", indicating that they are potential decoys, but 
these are intended strictly for display purposes. 
22: 
More decorative wildfowl carvings. 
Note the model 
sneakboxes at extreme left, and the knife racks in rear. 
23: 
Another view of the table depicted in #22, showing more 
model sneakboxes. 
The small figures in the rear of the boats are 
miniature decoys. 
24: 
Sneakbox models made by Bill Rutter of West Creek, near 
Tuckerton. 
These are made of cedar, and sell for about $250.00 
each.

TXO1: Cf. PFP83—FTC1007 and PFP83—FTC1117. G—Forked River; 43GT 
G—Barnegat Bay; 42GT Clamming with Kenny Oliver. 
01: The "Mud Duck" at dockside. This garvey was built by Joe 
Reid of G—Waretown; 53GT. The owner is Kenny Oliver, who is a part— 
time clammer and bayman, and full—time employee of the State of 
New Jersey. Although this garvey is built with a cabin, the 
traditional work garvey did not have such a convenience. It 
is 
possible for Kenny to have a cabin because of the method of 
clamming that he employs. Termed "rakin", this involves dropping 
a rake over the stern of the boat and raking clams into the rake 
heads as the boats drifts slowly with the tide. 
In other methods, 
such as tonging, the clammer walks up and down the length of the 
boat, and often switches sides. A cabin is a definite 
disadvantage when this method is employed, because it 
inhibits 
the mobility of the clammer. The "Mud Duck" 
is docked at the 
Riveria South Winds marina in Lacey Township just off of Route 9. 
02: This photograph was taken as Kenny steered the boat onto 
the clamming grounds. Note the other work garvey in the 
background. Its owner was also clamming by the raking method. 
03: When this photograph was taken, we had arrived at a 
suitable spot for clamming, and Kenny was making preparations to 
do so. Here he 
is preparing to drop an "anchor." Actually, the 
function of this device is to dig 
in the soft bay bottom and slow 
the movement of the boat caused by the tides. The raking method 
of clamming, however, 
is dependent upon some movement of the 
boat. 
04: The clam rake head in the bottom of the boat. 
05: When not in use, the rake handle and the head, or basket, 
are separated. Here Kenny 
is joining them in preparation for 
clamming. 
06: Kenny is about to drop the rake into the water. 
07: Kenny is shown raking for clams. For a fuller description 
of this activity see PFP83—FTC1117. 
08: Pulling the rake out of the water, with clams visible in 
the rake head. Kenny says that he can count the clams as they 
enter the rake head by paying attention to the vibrations 
transmitted through the rake handle. 
09: Depositing clams on the deck. 
Carroll--83 Color photo logs 
page 5 
10: Clams on the deck of the garvey. When a sufficient number 
have been deposited there, the clammer sorts them, throws debris, 
such as dirt and stones and empty shells, back into the water, 
and bags the clams. The clams are sorted by size, and generally 
fall 
into three categories. The rake handle is visible in the 
background.

TX01: Living room of Ed Hazelton of G—Manahawkin; 56GT. Ed recently 
retired from the building trades. He 
is a long—time duck hunter 
and avid local historian. He carves decoys and builds model 
sneakboxes, as well as other local craft. 
01: Ed's collection of old glass bottles. 
02: A portion of his bookcase. His collection includes books 
on 
local history, sports such as hunting and fishing, and decoys. 
The books reflect his major interests. 
03: Two model sneakboxes made by Ed. The setting is 
appropriate. Note the shore bird decoy on the right and the duck 
decoy (a mallard hen?) on the left. 
04: A boat model built by Ed, of the type that was used to 
ferry visiting sportsmen from the mainland to hotels on the bay. 
05: 
Another boat model built by Ed. 
06: Two bufflehead duck decoys carved by Ed. The living room 
was filled with decoys that he himself had carved. Ed owns decoys 
that were carved by other men, some of them old working decoys, 
but these are not on display in his living room. Rather, the 
occupy a table and shelves in a room off the living room, which I 
believe to be a converted garage. 
07: A group of decoys carved by Ed occupies one of the end 
tables in the living room. 
08: Ed holding a hissing Canada goose that he carved one or 
two years ago for his grandson, 
09: Ed and Nora Rubinstein looking at a history of Stafford 
Township that was produced in celebration of the American 
Bicentennial. Ed was a contributor to the volume. 
10: One of Ed's fowling pieces. 
11: One of Ed's father's fowling pieces, dating back to the 
turn of the century. 
12: Ed examining a U. S. Geologic 
Survey map of the 
Manahawkin area in order to point out his favorite ducking 
grounds and the locations of some of the old gun clubs 
in the 
area.

TX01: See PFP83—FTC1116. Joe Reid's workshop G—Waretown; 53GT as he 
works on some clamming equipment. 
01: A pair of wood—head clamming handles and rakes. This type 
of handle had been used by clammers on the bay at one time, but 
had been superceded by metal heads. Joe made these and put them 
out in his yard, where they are currently "on display." 
02: Close—up of wood heads. 
03: Small garveys awaiting repairs in Joe's yard. Joe says 
that he always has new orders to fill and old garveys to repair, 
as well 
as a backlog of orders for tonging handles. 
04: Some white cedar, which Joe uses for building garveys, 
"seasoning out" 
in the yard outside the shop. 
05: The entrance to the workshop. Joe erects a frame to the 
south side of his shop, to which he attaches plastic sheeting. 
The result is a kind of greenhouse effect, which is useful 
in 
winter when the shop 
is cold. The plastic helps capture heat in 
the front of the shop, and Joe can go there to warm up as he 
works. On cloudy days, Joe uses a space heater to keep warm. 
06: Mahogany boards, from which Joe shapes tonging handles. 
07: Joe planing a tonging handle. 
08: A close—up of an identification plate that Joe attaches 
to every pair of handles that he produces. Joe says that they are 
useful 
in telling him if he made a particular pair of tongs, and 
when. The identification number is the date of manufacture, or 
rather that the tongs are completed. Joe will replace or repair a 
pair of tongs that break or prove defective within a certain 
period of time after they are made. 
09: Joe numbering an identification plate with hammer and 
chisel. 
10: Chiseling slot in tong handle to accommodate 
identification plate. 
11: Shaping the end of a tong handle in order to enable 
insertion into rake. 
12: Fitting rake head onto handle. 
13: Securing the heads onto the handles. 
14: Joe takes a measurement before attaching the two tong 
handles together with a brass pin. 
15: 
Insertion of pin into tong handles.
