Dear Mr.  Lloyd,
 
I like it!
 I like it!
 Porterfield's Last
; Cavalier  is everything
 
I look for in a biography:  readable,  fascinating,  poignant,
 
informative.
 Porterfield's writing style  just gets better and
 
better.
 Grab it while you can,  because if you don't -
_
-
_
_
_
_
_
 and
 Press will be after it  (if they
 
aren't already).
 
As we Texans know probably- better than anybody else,  Lomax was
 
pompous and highly controversial,  perhaps even "tragically
 
flawed," as they say in drama.
 What amazes me is that
 
Porterfield can write about him without revealing any animosity
 
or negative bias.
 After reading these chapters,  for the first
 
time I feel like I have some understanding of the two aspects of
 
Lomax's career which have perplexed me the most:
 his sojourn
 
(AKA exile)  at A&M and the stint at Harvard which gave birth to
 
Cowboy Songs.
 Both of these episodes are so imbedded in Texas
 
folklore that the truth apparently has been overpowered.
 I'm
 
pleased that this biography clears up so much.
 The Dobie-ized
 
Good Ole Boys in what passes for Texas folklore scholarship these
 
days are in for a jolt when this biography is published.
 
1 hesitate to try to answer your "Reader's Report Guide"  item by
 
item on this excellent partial manuscript.
 Let me briefly
 
summarize instead.
 This book will  fill a definite void in the
 
intellectual history of folklore scholarship as well as American
 
culture studies in general and should,  therefore,  appeal to a
 
national audience  (and not  just to a regional audience).
 The
 
overall scholarship,  documentation,  organization,  and development
 
of the biography are so well done that this manuscript could
 
practically be published "as is."
 
Thank you for letting me take a look at the manuscript.
 
I am returning the manuscript to you under separate cover.
