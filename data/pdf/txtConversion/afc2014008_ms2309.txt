Dear Dr Kielmani
 
v
hen  I called lour office week before
 
last and the assistant said 1 you were ill I asked her
 
to tell you that I am still awaiting your answer to my
 
letter of several months ago.
 Hope that you are well
 
and sassy agin by now.
 
Every one in the family is in agreement
 
about the papers in the general realm of two things a
 
7hat the personal and extraneous matetial that is inclu-
id (beacause the family did not sort through them before
 
they were taken to Austin) should be sifted out and
 
that I em the one who gets the booby prize.  I read and
 
reread many of the letters beteen myslef and my father
 
after mother's death concdrnig various problems with
 
the two younger members of our family because I was the
 
one concerned;and there is no possible histormical sig-
nificance in those, nor would I like Alan nor Bess to
 
read them.
 hhen I talked with Alan he was outraged that
 
his letters to his father about his  roblems should at
 
any time be open to outsiders.  We all feel most strongly
 
about this and I am ready to make plans to attack the
 
mess.
 
I was told at the southwest Collection
 
that I should find out what the original agreement was
 
before proceeding.
 Please let me have this information
 
as soon as it is possible so that I may know how to pro-
ceed.
 
Sincerely

Dear Mr.  Billings:
 
TELEPHONE
 
806-763-7385
 
We represent Shirley L. Mansell,  one of  the daughters of John A. Lomax,
 
as well as other heirs of Mr. Lomax.
 
Joseph F. Lomax has tried to contact you,  and perhaps others have
 
contacted you but have not received the information that they desire
 
with regard to  the Lomax Archives which are housed at  the University
 
of Texas.
 
It would be appreciated if you would respond to  the following questions
 
at your earliest convenience:
 
Under what conditions does the University continue to hold
 
the papers of  the late John A. Lomax?
 Please furnish us
 
copies of instruments,  if any,  which would purport to
 
convey such papers to  the University.
 
From the University's standpoint,  do  the heirs of  the late
 
John A. Lomax have the right to remove materials contained
 
in the archives which were a part of  the papers of the
 
late John A. Lomax?
 You may know that some of  these
 
materials are highly person-1 in nature and Mrs. Mansell
 
feels that these personal  items should be removed and not
 
left there for possible public  scrutiny.
 
In the event there is no document conveying  these papers
 
to the University,  we would like to know the correct
 
procedure for so doing in the event the heirs desire to
 
confirm the gift.
 
In the event the heirs would not be  interested in making
 
a gift of  the papers,  would  the University or  the Humanities
 
Research Center be interested in purchasing  the papers?
 
At the present time who currently has access to  these papers?
 
Mr.  Harold Billings

Dear Mr.  Baker:
 
June 4,  1979
 
I have been called in from my personal vacation to respond to your
 
letter of May 30,  1979,  relating to the John A.  Lomax Papers.
 I have
 
had a draft of a letter to Mr.  Joseph Lomax on my desk pending comple-
tion the past three weeks much of which time I was out of town.
 This
 
letter was in response to several discussions I had with Mr.  Lomax
 
by  telephone regarding this gift made to The University in 1948.
 
I first talked to Mr.  Lomax on March 9,  1979,  after I understood he
 
had not had any response to earlier inquiries directed to the Barker
 
Texas History Center.
 At that time I asked Dr.  Chester Kielman,  Li-
brarian/Archivist of the Barker Center to search the Center's files
 
for information relating to the Lomax gift.
 His response to me is
 
attached.
 Since this information apparently did not provide the facts
 
needed to resolve Mr.  Lomax's questions I called Mr.  Lomax on April  11
 
and told him we would look further among the old gift files to see
 
what additional  information might be found.
 This search resulted in
 
the location of copies of the attached documents which I was preparing
 
to send Mr.  Lomax.
 I cannot  find the original  letters and presume
 
they are probably in the Board of Regents'  office or possibly in the
 
Development Office.
 
In any event,  it  is clear that the John A.  Lomax Papers were given
 
to The University by John A.  Lomax and Ruby Terrill Lomax in 1947-48.
 
Mr.  Lomax's letter of 7/1 7 /1947 to Miss Winnie Allen,  University Ar-
chivist,  reads:
 
"We've grown tired looking for you to come back.
 Through
 
August no one will be at home,  so only you and Henry will
 
be around if you have planned to come then.
 
"I have decided to give The University of Texas all my
 
papers except those referring to the Ballads.
 But they
 
need the arranging that you were giving them.
 
"I hope you are well  and happy.
 
"Yours always,  John A.  Lomax."
 
You will see Miss Allen's response of July 22,  1947,  and her acknow-
ledgement of the gift to Mrs. Lomax dated March 25,  1948,  in which
 
she says,  "It is agreed that these papers be used for biographical
 
purposes only with the authorization of the heirs," and the heirs
 
are then listed.
 These letters tie directly to the Archives records
 
dated March 18,  1948,  and March 22,  1948,  also attached.
 
Thus,  it appears to me that these papers have been university prop-
erty since 1948,  and as state property none can be returned to any
 
heir.
 As  I understand it,  the practice in the University Archives
 
has been to restrict acco-ss to the biographical documents to only
 
those persons given permission by  the heirs,  and that has only been
 
one or two persons  in the past  twenty years.
 
The University has long benefited by a cordial relations h i p

From:

Subject:
 John A. Lomax Papers
 
The correspondence in the Archives relating to the acquisition of
 
the John A. Lomax Papers is quite meager.
 The first letters, written
 
in the summer of 1942, are an exchange between Miss Allen and Mrs.
 
Lomax relating to a poem and having nothing to do with Mr. Lomax'
 
papers.
 The next exchanges, four letters between Miss Allen and Mr.
 
Lomax written in October and November of 1944, contain Miss Allen's
 
invitation for him to consider giving his papers to the Archives
 
and his response.  Miss Allen was invited, to study the collection
 
with Mr. Lomax and did visit in March, 1945, according to Mr. Lomax'
 
letter to her dated March 18, 1945.
 He invited her to come back to
 
complete the work.  Apparently, according to a letter of July 7
,
 
1945, Miss Allen did return to Dallas later but the Lomaxds were
 
not at home.
 Although there are no letters to document the fact,
 
Miss Allen seems to have revisited the Lomaxes during the next year.
 
According to a letter dated February 12, 1947, Miss Allen submitted
 
her report on the collection to Mr. Lomax at that time.
 In two
 
letters written in August and September, 1947, Mr. Lomax urges
 
Miss Allen to come back and finish the work.
 
The holding record, in addition to the letters noted above, also
 
contains a manuscript receipt memorandum dated March 18, 1948,
 
a copy of which is attached.
 The only other record of this type
 
is an inventory sheet dated March 22, 1948.  A copy of this is
 
also attached.
 
Among the later letters in the holding record only one seems to
 
be relevant to the present questions.
 Dated October 4, 1949, from
 
Miss Allen to Mrs. Lomax, this letter states that the collection
 
is ready for microfilming.
 There are no other records relating
 
to microfilming.

Dear Mr.  Billings:
 
TELEPHONE
 
806-763-7385
 
Thank you for your letter of June 4,  1979 regarding the John A. Lomax
 
papers.
 
I have talked with Shirley Mansell who is the oldest daughter of
 
Mr. Lomax and she advises that this was the first
. time that she had
 
seen the information that you sent me with your letter.
 
Mrs. Mansell advises that the family would like to have the personal
 
letters written by Mr. Lomax to them and vice versa,
, old checkbooks
 
that are in the Lomax papers, along with other similar personal items.
 
We do not contemplate any legal problem involved in this and would
 
appreciate your advising if the above request is satisfactory.
 
Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
 
Very truly yours,
