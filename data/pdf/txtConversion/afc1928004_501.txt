In martial array we see each day 
Our soldiers on parade, 
With mu.;ic sweet and tramping feet, 
Bright uniforms arrayed. 
But I know a 
soldier fair, 
Who is handsome, brave and gay, 
The ladies faint with love's complaint 
When he gets in their way. 
TI C) Itvs. 
Major Majolica, he is a 
roillicker, 
Brave and handsome, clashing and gay, 
Ile is a 
stiller, and such a 
trifler. 
The major is mashing the ladies all day. 
[Repeat Chorusl 
When cannons go off he gives a laugh, 
Says, " Load ' em and go it again I" 
When bullets are thick he always is quick 
To escape any danger or pain. 
Ile draws his sword, rays " Onward, boys!" 
And then goes to the rear. 
The girls would die, or else they'd sigh, 
If they lost the major dear.

Published by permission. - 
We've oft sung of the major, 
And of the captain too, 
But now I've chosen for my rhyme 
A 
subject new to you. 
'Tis of our gallant soldier boys, 
All honor them the while, 
Our boys in blue and sailors true, 
Who belong to the Rank and File. 
CHORUS. 
Eyes right! Steady, boys! 
Merrily we cheer, 
Under the starry flag, 
That ever we hold dear. 
Gaily the music plays, 
The ladies love to smile 
Upon the throng a 
thousand strong, 
Who belong to the Rank and File. 
In the tented field of honor 
We hold our lives but small, 
And bravely clan together 
At the bugle's martial call. 
We greet the shouts of victory 
With cheers and saddened smile, 
And sigh for slaughtered comrades 
Who belonged to the Rank and File. 
Eyes right, &c. 
When in the days of Seventy-six 
Our country plunged in war, 
And peril ev'rywhere beset 
Our foe invaded shore; 
Bold, sturdy men were needed then, 
To win proud vict'ry's smile, 
So while we're here let's give a 
cheer 
For America's Rank and File. 
Eyes right, &c.

On a 
bright summer morning I 
pursued my way, 
As happy as a 
robin when he trills his lay, 
That morning such a 
letter from my true love came, 
Commencing with " My Dearest," and concluding with her 
name. 
Such a 
pretty letter, with its perfume sweet, 
Cupid's with their arrows loving hearts to meet, 
Lots of blots for kisses, and a 
seal of blue, 
Meaning that my love is true to you. 
CHORUS. 
For on a 
bright summer morning I 
pursued my way, 
As happy as a 
robin when he trills his lay, 
That morning such a 
letter from my true love came, 
Commencing with " My Dearest," and concluding with her 
name. 
Nov who the letter came from I 
of course must tell, 
A charming little maiden, and her name is Belle, 
She's just as sweet as honey, and she writes to me— 
You see that we are parted, she is far across the sea. 
If you've ever been in love, of course you'll understand 
The feelings of my heart, when loving letters reach your hand, - 
How 
you'll stand and wonder what your sweetheart she has said, 
As I 
did, with the one that I 
have read. 
For on a 
bright summer, &c. 
Of course I'm going to answer in a 
true love strain, 
And ask my little darling to return again, 
And soon a 
ship that's sailing o'er the dark blue sea, 
Will bring me such a 
letter, from my sweetheart it will be. 
Then when we are married, I 
will write you all the news, 
Tell you how we get along, and never have the blues, 
What a 
little treasure wife I 
got from o'er the sea, 
Our letters then will spell L-O-V- E. 
For on a 
bright summer, &c.

When the summer breeze \--
as blowing-
O'er the land and far across the sea; 
I 
met a 
little blue-eyed stranger, 
As pretty as can be, 
Her dress the pink of neatness, 
Her walk the height of grice, 
Her smile the mould of sweetness, 
And such a 
handsome face. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! when the summer breeze was blowing, 
O'er the 1-nd and far across the sea, 
I 
met a 
little blue-eved stranger, 
As pretty as can be. 
Wavy golden ringlets flowing 
To the breeze so merry, light and free, 
That kissed the little blue-eyed stranger, 
As pretty as can be. 
Towards her I 
walked gaily, 
While waves rolled cn the shore, 
I 
tried to speak, but vainly, 
I 
ne'er felt so before. 
Oh ! when the summer, & c. 
The sequel to the story knowing, 
The end of course you'd like to hear from me ; 
I've wed this little blue-eyed stranger, 
As pretty as can be. 
We're living in contentment 
Just down by the shore, 
And another little stranger 
Now plays around the door. 
Oh ! when the summer, & c.

whispered—

You'll forget me not!"

We met—I 
really don't know where— 
But still ' tis all the same— 
Por love walks in the busy streets 
As well as in the lane: 
I 
gently pressed her tiny hand: 
She glanced at me a 
shot— 
She dropped a 
flower, I 
picked it up— 
A sweet forget-me-not

At last there came a 
happy day 
And something that I 
said 
Just caused her lips to murmur " yes I" 
And shortly we were wed.

And a 
tiny garden spot 
Where grows a 
little flower called—

DORKINS THE ACTOR, 
Written by BOBBY NEWCOMB, and sung with great scccss by 
W ILL. II. 
MORTON, With HARRIGAN it HART'S Corphin7,t16.1, 
(Yew version) 
The theatre was full, it was Dorkins' night— 
That is. Dorkins was going to play, 
A 
character new to himself and the stage 
That he'd trod for so many a 
day. 
By eight the theatre was perfectly jammed, 
All awaited a 
pleasant surprise, 
For they knew they would laugh till their sides would ache, 
Anil they longed for the curtain to rise. 
The play soon began, each neck was stretched forth, 
And eagerly watched each eye 
For Dorkins to make his first entrance, and then 
To give him a 
cheerful Hi, Hi! 
He soon appeared amidst loud applause, 
But something was wrong you could see : 
Why Dorkins is playing quite badly to- night, 
The people said sitting around me. 
A 
yes, it was I 
saw Dorkins start, 
As though stumg by a 
serpent's fang, 
Then he cast a 
beseeching look all around, 
And his head on his breast did hang. 
Some said he was drunk, and I 
thought so myself, 
For to me it was awful at times. 
To see how he'd struggle along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines. 
At last he the footlights then slowly approached, 
And ladies and gentlemen said, 
Believe me, if I 
cannot please on to- night, 
The faults not the heart but the head; 
Many a 
time I 
made you all laugh, 
When I 
was scarce able to stand, 
And every effort was pain to me then, 
Yes, if I'd raise but my hand. 
You hiss me to- night, and say that I'm drunk; 
From his breast came a 
sob and a 
moan, 
When I 
tell you the reason, I 
know you won't laugh, 
I've a 
little one dying at home, 
WHEN I 
BEAT THE BIG BA.SS DRUM.

DON'T PUT THE POOR WORKINGMAN 
DOWN. 
Words and Music by BOBBY NEWCOMB. 
Copyrighted,. 1877, by F. W. HELMICK, No. 50 West Fourth 
Street, Cincinnati, Ohio. 
Price 35 cents. 
How oft when we hear of misfortune, 
Befalling a 
friend or a 
foe, 
If n 
joy or regrets we express it, 
That's the way of the world you all know; 
I 
thought I 
would speak of a 
subject, 
Interesting each village and town, 
That is iron- heeled capital striving 
To put the poor workingman down. 
CHORUS. 
Let capital shake hands with labor, 
Let the poor have the bread that they earn, 
For surely they. need every penny, 
Is a 
lesson qii!te easy to learn; 
Remember the poor love their children, 
So give them a 
smile, not a 
frown, 
Live, and let live, be your motto, 
Oh! don't put the poor workingman down. 
That money is the root of all evil, 
Why all of us likely's found out, 
The richer class think that the poorer, 
Should of pleasure know nothing about; 
The honest poor always will labor, 
They don't ask a 
title or crown, 
Why begrudge them sufficient to live on, 
Don't put the poor workingman down. 
Let capital, etc. 
So now in conclusion 
mention, 
That life being dear to us all, 
The poorer class must have existence, 
So   
don't push them close to the wall 
Now hope that in future, the richer 
On the poorer will smile and not frown, 
Who ask but enough just to live on, 
Don't put the poor workingman down. 
Let capital, etc

AS I 
strolled out by chance one day, 
'Twas in the summer time, 
I 
first bc held a 
fairy form, 
And since I've called her mine; 
Some flowers she was bending o'er— 
I 
begged of her a 
few; 
The glance exchanged was one of love, 
Down where the pansies grow. — Dance 
CHORUS. 
And we whispered and we lart bed so free, 
And of course we were as happy as cou!d be, 
Oh her smiles they are as bright as the rays 
Of the sun that loves the dew ; 
Two hearts were moulded into one, 
Down where the pansies grew. 
The favor asked was but a 
bud, 
A 
rose t at she posessed ; 
The little flower love implied, 
And that I'd half confess'd ; 
Her cheeks were blushing : ike the leaf, 
In all its rosy hue; 
That even ng I 
exchanged a 
kiss, 
Down where the pansies grw. 
And we whispered, &c. 
The flowers faded, but her love 
Remains as bright and green; 
And since the day I've called 11( r 
mine, 
how ha!py we have been; 
So now the story I 
have told,

can give 
For I

The next one that I'm going to ask,

Is vhat does a

When he wears his pants out. 
Why, if he Wear,i them out, of course, 
The answer it is plain, 
Ile does not worry himself at all 
But wears them home again.

In the Central Park, the other day, 
I 
met my charmer fair, 
Her pretty face and beaming smiles— 
And she had such lovely hair— 
While from beneath her jockey hat 
Those curly tresses fell ; 
And when I 
smiled she blushed, and look'd 
Like the roses in the dell.

And it's Oh, My ! she looked divine. 
How I 
wished that she was mine. 
She's the fairest little flower I've ever seen ; 
In the Park she is the Belle ! 
Wheneer we meet, her blush is just 
Like the roses in the dell. 
We sat awhile beneath the tree, 
The time flew swiftly by ; 
She said she felt so happy then, 
But could not tell me why ; 
I 
asked her, then, if she'd be mine t 
Into my arms she fell, 
And answered " Yes I" and crimson blushed, 
Like the roses in the dell. 
And it's Oh, My ! kc.

While strolling out upon the beach, 
One Summer day in May, 
I 
met a 
charming little maid, 
Who chanced to pass my way; 
Such lovely eyes bewitching me, 
I 
never saw more fair, 
But what won me completely 
Was, her golden flowing hair. 
CHORUS. 
She's such a 
little beauty, 
To love her is my duty. 
Such lovely eyes bewitching me, 
You'd surely at her stare; 
.And what won me completely 
Was, her golden flowing hair. 
(Dance.) 
We chatted like two friends of yore, 
And leisurely strolled along, 
I 
praised her beauty more and more, 
She said that I 
was wrong; 
And when I 
reached her home, 
Where roses scent the air, 
She seemed like an angel grand, 
With her golden flowing hair. 
She's such, etc.

When she began tc. sigh, 
Your refusal, Hetty, dear, 
Will cause nr:i for to die, 
She threw her arms around my neck, 
And kissed my lace all over, 
She said your mine through life or death, 
My own devoted lover.

OUR FAVORITE SONG AND DANCE. 
Composed by JAMES R. 
W ALSH. 
Sung by W ALSH and KING. 
'Twas an evening in midsummer, 
When the stars did gently peep, 
Reclining in the meadow, 
I 
tried to doze asleep ; 
When a 
vision of surpassing beauty, 
Then passed me by too soon, 
With form so slight and step so light, 
Where the little roses bloom. 
CIIORUS. 
Her name she would not tell me, (Break.) 
'Twas love then that befell me, 
For the sweetest girl I 
knew ; 
Arm in arm we wandered gaily, 
By the light of the silvery moon; 
She said I'll meet you love again 
Where the little roses bloom. 
(Dance.) 
I 
was there on time next evening 
Ere the stars had shown their light; 
When tripping down the pathway 
She came with footstep slight; 
Said s1 
D 
let us wander 
Al) ..11-.ough the flowery dell; 
Said . 1... your wish is dear to me, 
(Pr: tales of love let's tell. 
Her name, &e. 
Wc talked and chatted happy, 
The hours flew nimbly by; 
But when the hour of parting came, 
A 
tear was in her eye; 
I 
said it grieves me sorely) 
My love to part with thee; 
Just then I 
saw her handkerchief 
Marked A-N-N- I- E.

CnoNnt 
Above all the pretty sights to see 
In the Park, some afternoon ; 
When all the pretty girls are out, 
Like roses in full bloom. 
'Twas at the Park I 
lost my heart, 
While there the other day, 
I 
sat beside a 
charming girl, 
When the Band began to play. 
Cnonus. 
Oh ! those sweet strains they linger yet. [Break. 
Reminds me of the time we met. [ Break. 
Oh! how I 
loved this little beauty, 
And blessed that happy day 
That fate led us to the Central Park, 
When the Band begin to play. 
Next evening, as I 
passed her house, 
I 
called, my love to see ; 
We wandered on, side by side— 
'Twas hours of bliss to me; 
We spoke about the sweet music, 
As the moments passed away. 
Oh ! how I 
felt, I'll ne'er forget, 
When the Band began to play.

WHEN WE WERE LITTLE BOYS, 
Written by CHAS. SEAMON. 
Song and Dance. 
ONE day, while musing quietly, 
Not knowing what to do, 
Our thoughts did wander Lack again 
To times of long ago; 
When father appeared just like a 
Loy, 
Would caper around and prance 
To the banjo's sweetest melodies 
In merry song and dance. 
Music is so very sweet, 
It always makes us move our feet. 
Oh, don't we love this dancing! 
It fills our hearts with joy; 
We caught it from our good old dad 
When we were little boys. 
(SYm.) 
(Sym.) 
The longer that we live 
We learn some new things good or bad ; 
We always took the new things in 
We learnt from our old dad. 
This style of dancing now is new, 
Not like those days gone by, 
So watch us, and you soon will see 
How we make these old shoes fly. 
Music is so very sweet, etc.

KNEW a

Her hair was like the raven, her lips were like the rose, 
Of many thousand beauties, she was the one to choose.

We met close by a 
streamlet, we wandered through a

Her hair was like the raven, her lips were like the rose, 
Of many thousand beauties, she was the one to chose. 
Oh! Stella how I 
love you, no mortal tongue can tell, 
Your eyes like brightest diamonds, worth million pounds to sell, 
Your form is like the graces, to endorse bewildered man, 
It is honor for to love you, 
win you if I 
can. 
Oh! Stella, 3,:c. 
The world would be a

We'll wander o'er the lea, 
And we'll sing and dance

We feel so merrily. 
With her I 
stroll out evenings 
To ramble through the dell, 
And pick the pretty violets 
I 
know she loves so well. 
But though we'll never marry 
With her I 
shall not part, 
For still I 
feel the cruel force 
Of Cupid's tiny dart. 
But still with Annie Dee, 8cc.

We're happy as two clams ; 
We'll sing and do a

At home in Alabam.

But soon he passed away ; 
And silence reigns around the place, 
Where things were once so gay. 
The darkies they have all gone North, 
And scarcely left a

To play upon the old banjo, 
At home in Alabam. 
The good old times, &c. 
Oh! white folks all, we'll say good-bye,

We hail from dear old Ireland, that little isle so green, 
The birthplace of O'Connell, and the land of pure potheen. 
We couldn't easy rest at home, contented wouldn't be, 
But left the boys and girls behind, America to see. 
We landed here upon your shores, our prospects looked quite 
blue, 
We had but little money, and we had no work to do. 
We started in with courage, and we're known now everywhere, 
By all the people far and near, this Dancing Irish Pair. 
CHORUS. 
Play up the music while we dance, we'll make the welkin ring, 
For dancing is a 
pastime, and we're happy while we *sing, 
We never borrow trouble for we're gay and free from care, 
And known by people everywhere this Dancing Irish Pair. 
The colleens dear we've left behind are sighing every day, 
They long to see this Irish pair, from whom they're far away, 
The day we left we bade good bye and pledged our heart and 
hand— 
They'll welcome us when we return again to Paddy's land. 
Then come what will, whate'er betide, we'll dance the livelong 
day, 
So give us your applause kind friends to cheer us on our way, 
And when we do return again to America to see, 
We hope that in your kindness, we will not forgotten be.

And if you come some other evening, 
We'll be happy to see 
All your smiling races— 
It will fill us full of glee. 
We're as lively, &c. 
Duck-Foot Sue. 
DUTCH SONG AND DANCE. 
Sung by LARRY TOOLEY. 
Oh, keep your seats a 
while, and I 
will sing to you 
The love I 
feel for a 
girl, they call ter duck-foot Sue. 
She is gentle and divine, long-waisted in the feet, 
Her heels stick out behind like a 
13-karat beat. 
But now I 
sing to you of the girl I 
love so well, 
She is second-handed maid in a 
Chinese laundry away out 
in Kalarnozan. 
Her beauty was all she had, she was sailed like the author 
of a 
shad; 
She had an India rubber lip, like the rudder of a 
ship ; with 
the razor she was bad. 
She wasn't very fat nor was she very thin, 
She looked when she was dressed like a 
straw in a 
barrel of gin. 
I 
took her to a 
ball to the Hordelyobel Club, 
It cost me a 
ten cent stamp for to fill her up with grub. 
Her eyes were indigo blue, she'd a 
voice like a 
kangaroo. 
She could chin for an hour with a 
forty horse power, and 
whistle like a 
steamboat, too. 
She'd ears like a 
Tapanese fan, and a 
voice likea catamaran. 
She was chief crq;ineer in a 
bash factory ( jig) away out in 
Kalanzozan. 
Lily of the Valley. 
As sung by the FRENCH TWIN SISTERS. 
Will you take a 
little ramble in the country? 
'Tis only just a 
little way from town, 
To an ivy-covered cottage in the valley, 
Where dwells a 
lovely maiden of renown. 
And sh.:'s the sweetest girl by far 
That ever I 
did see, 
Among the pretty girls a 
star 
She always seems to me. j 
CHORUS. 
She's the lily of the valley, (Break.) 
And the maid I 
hope to marry. (Break.) 
Then come and take a 
ramble in the country, 
To where the scent of roses fills the air. 
Oh come and see the lily of the valley, 
All in her golden beauty sweet and fair. 
Oh, you should see her early in the morning, 
That's when she goes for water at the vpring, 
And see the smile her lovely face adorning, 
And hear the charming songs I 
heard her sing. 
Her smile you never could forget, 
It would haunt your lonely hours 
With happy thoughts of when you met 
My love among the flowers. 
She's the lily &c. 
Lively Mokes. 
ECCENTRIC SONG AND DANCE. 
Composed by JAmEs R. 
W ALSH. 
Performed by W ALSH and KING. 
Here we are two lively mokes, 
Two genuine southern mokes, 
We came from way down south in Tennessee 
It was there we worked all day 
In the cotton fields so gay, 
'Till old massa went and set us darkies free. 
CHORUS. 
Oh the high times on the old plantation 
We will not forget where'er we go, 
As our hearts are feeling light, 
We have come out here to night, 
On purpose for to let you white folks know. 
When our work was o'er at night 
And the moon was shining bright, 
We'd sit beneath the porch above the door, 
With the bones and tambourine; 
Then we darkies could be seen, 
While we'd break it down upon the kitchen floor.

(1st Rival)—I 
wonder what can keep that girl, 
She's generally on time, 
I 
mean the charming octoroon, 
The subject of this rhyme; 
She passes here at half past eight, 
I'm always here to see, 
But there's so many other coons, 
See never looks at me. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! how I'd dance, 
If I 
could get a 
chance 
To meet this charmer fair; 
I'd quick propose 
To lovely Rose 
This girl with the jet black hair. 
There'e other rivals waiting now, 
And one rigat hero I 
see, 
[Enter 2cl Rival] 
I'll let him know that I'm the boss, 
If he interferes with me; 
(2c1 Rival)—You can have accommodations, 
If what you mean is tight, 
I 
want to have no quarrel, 
But still I'll do what's right. 
(Both)-0h, how you'd dance, etc. 
(lst)—Upon due consideration. 
I 
don't want to fight, 
(2d)—Let s 
shake hands and be good friends, 
Though rivals from to- night; 
(1st)—With all my heart, but first agree 
To put her to the test, 
(2d)—We'll make her say before we part, 
Which one that she loves best.

Arrah, Biddy, now hold your tongue, 
While I 
praise the girls, both old and young; 
It is my only thought, both night and day, 
Since I 
met her at Galway. 
She can tread as light as any pearl, 
My own, my sweet Galway girl; 
For she's as lovely as a 
flower, 
And she's all the world to me. 
CHORUS. 
She's as handsome as a 
rose. (Break.) 
That in the garden grows; (Break.) 
You should see her on St. Patrick's Day, 
A making whiskey for the tay, 
With her hair tied in ribbons green, 
I 
tell you she's supreme. 
(Dance.) 
It was on the mossy banks of Galway 
That I 
met my true love, 
And I 
promised that I 
would wed her, 
By the little stars that shine above. 
Oh, soon she's coming to America, 
And then so happy I 
will be ; 
For she's as lovely as a 
flower, 
And she's all the world to me. 
She's as handsome, &c.

We both to the church will go.

SONG AND DANCE. 
Written and composed by TONI HARPER, the original ONE LEGGED 
SONG AND DANCE M AN. 
On the banks of the river Ohio, 
In a 
quiet flowing glade, 
Where the soft and gentle river flows 
In sunshine and in shade; 
It was there I 
saw a 
maiden fair, 
Eyes jet and breast like snow, 
And in meeting her has caused me great despair— 
Down by the Ohio. 
Beneath the trees she lay rec'ining ( Break.) 
Her two bright eyes like stars were shining (Break.) 
CHORUS. 
And as I 
gazed upon her form, 
I 
lost my heart, you know; 
I 
won't forget the girl I 
met 
Down by the Ohio. 
I 
took courage to kiss her little hand, 
When she started like a 
fawn, 
And blushed like the rose of early morn 
That spreads all o'er the dawn. 
I 
said and would she be mine, 
She slowly answered, " No," 
And left me standing all alone 
Down by the Ohio. 
And as I 
gazed, &c.

But with a

We meet at night, when stars shine brigh), 
Down by the garden gate ; 
Then fond lips meet, in kisses sweet, 
Until the hours grow late.

SUNNY LAND. 
ORIGINAL SONG AND PINCE. 
By COTTON & BIEDUE. 
When we were together, in that sunny land, 
Where all's Eternal Spring, 
We'd wander through the cotton fields, 
And hear the Jay-bird sing. 
We'd hunt the Old Raccoon, 
By the glimmer of the Moon, 
Whene'er we had a 
chance. 
At evening, when the boys were on the greet, 
We'd join them in the festive dance! 
Cnonus. 
Gay and smiling! 
Hours beguiling! 
Oh, give us back the home we used to have, 
Down in that sunny land! 
When we were a 
courting Poll and Bess, 
Down in that sunny land; 
We'd take them rowing on the Lake, 
Or strolling on the strand; 
We'd take the old Banjo, 
And together we would go 
And stay until the break of day ! 
We wish those happy, happy days 
Had never passed away. 
CHORUS. 
Gay and smiling! 
Hours beguiling! 
Oh, give us back the home we used to have, 
Down in our sunny land

Oh, we just came in from Washington this morning, (Crash.)

Oh, we stopped here for refreshments, 
And to talk politics out of existence, 
We're Representatives from the White House in Washington. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, we sport around the town, 
Our equals can't be found, 
The Mayor and Aldermen they want us then 
For to come and sup and dine, 
Though we scarcely have the time— 
We Representatives from the White House in Wash-
ington. (Dance.) 
Now we must leave, for we can no longer stay, (Crash.) 
For if we do you know ' twill never pay. (Crash.)

When the flowers bloom so gay, 
Now mind, don't give us away, 
Hey, what do you say ?

And I 
quickly did discover 
That she was not now afraid, 
When I 
acted as a

Soon great progress then I 
made. 
Married life she raid she'd like it, 
And she'd gladly marry me: 
So a 
bargain we did strik 
it, 
And my wife she'll shortly be, 
And when arrives the happy day 
When I 
squeeze her she won't say—

Georgie now you frighten me; 
We'll spend our future days at Dove; 
But I 
won't give over or let her be.

How my heart goes bump when I 
think of the day 
That we both first met in the new mown hay, 
She looked like a 
rose with a 
delicate blush, 
Or a 
sweet water lily all among the rush. 
I 
sighed. " Pretty Polly, what a 
witch you are 
And she said, get along, or I'll tell Grandpa." 
She's just like an angel that sweetly sings, 
I 
should really think she is, but she's got no wings.

Then we march'd down to supper 
In 'ristocratic style, 
The coaches on the outside 
Would reach an Irish mile; 
The company assembled 
Were the pride of our city, 
The solid men from ev'ry ward, 
Were at Higgins' Coterie. —Ref.

Reporters from the " Herald," 
The " Tribune," and the " Sun," 
Took the names of all the ladies, 
Just when the ball begun; 
The Haleys and the Daleys, 
Myself, and Nell Mc' Gee, 
Were paraded in the papers, 
From Higgins' Coterie. —Ref.

There was Burns, the big distiller, 
M'c Bride, the alderman, 
And a: wealthy Cuban lady, 
With diamonds on her hand; 
She walk'd around the ball-room 
Like a 
queen of high degree, 
All the wealth was represented 
At Higgin's Coterie. — Ref

At six o'clock next morning, 
The band played " Patrick's day," 
In horse-cars and in stages, 
The crowd all went away; 
It pulverized poor Higgins, 
And kill'd his family, 
He's living on free lunches 
Since he gave the Coterie.—Ref

courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such PI way as to be non-co,nmittaL 
Many young ladies are visited by 
riflemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
, 
tnent. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which misilt have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. 
The pla,ring of these Cards is mot restricted to two fdarers, 
but may 'be enjoyed by evening parties

Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
" 
Ali ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order 
has been sent us, called HUMPTY DUMPTY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear-
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit ; the next, only Columbine ; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. 
A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at home in the hand-
ling of it."—Phila. Evening Bulletin.'
