State. 
It was down in de meadow I 
used. to make de

dear May. 
Oh dearest May, your lovelier dan de day, 
Your eyes so bright they chine at night, 
When de moon am gone away.

To de cottage of my lovely May, I 
longed so 
much to see. 
Oh, dearest May, Sze. 
On de bank ob de ribber where de trees dey 
hang so low, 
When de coon among de branches play, and 
de mink he keeps below, 
Oh, dere is de spot, and May she looks so 
sweet, 
her eyes dey sparkle like de stars and her 
lips am red as beet. 
Oh, dearest May, &c. 
Beneath de shady old oak tree I 
sot for many 
an hour, 
As happy as de buzzard bird dat sports 
among de flowers. 
But dearest May I 
left her, and she cried 
when both we parted, 
I 
gave her a 
long and farewell kiss, and back 
to massa started.

And watch the nigger's fingers while he picks
