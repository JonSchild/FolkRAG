The RoseNo beautiful palace have I on the hill;No pictures to hang in my hall,But there is no painter
can match with the skillOf the roses that bloom on my wall.Chorus:Then sing me a song of the
rose,A song that is tender and true.She wears a red rose like the daintiest queenAll gleaming in
jewels of dew.As roses of Sharon sweet perfume the air,Your beauty and fragrance you charm
away care.When in noonday zephyrs your petals unfold,I would not exchange for a chalis of gold.
*Chorus: [md] Then sing me a song of the rose, &c.Down in a green valley all purple and gold,The
morning came dewy and bright.I looked from my window to see them unfoldTheir buds at the kiss
of the light.Chorus: [md] Then sing me a song of the rose, &c.And when in the evening my labors are
o'er,The shadows grow long o'er the lee,The breath of the roses comes in at the doorAs if they were
talking to me.Chorus: [md] Then sing me a song of the rose, &c.

The breath of the roles comes in at the doorAs if they were talking to me [.?] Then sing me a song of

The title of this song is THE ROSE. It's a very ancient song [md] perhapsabout five hundred years old
at least.
No beautiful palace have I on the hill ; No pictures to hang in my hall , But there is no painter can
match with the skillOf the roses that bloom on my wall . Then sing me a song of the rose , A song
that is tender and true . She wears a red rose like the daintiest queenAll gleaming in jewels of dew.
