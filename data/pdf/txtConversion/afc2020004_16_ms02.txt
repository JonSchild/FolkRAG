START OF RECORDING 
 
Heather Cahoon:  My name is Heather Cahoon and I’m from the Flathead Reservation in 
western Montana and I’m a member of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes. 
 
[Heather Cahoon reads “Baby Out of Cut-Open Woman”] 
 
HC:  So, this poem relates a portion of a really, really old Séliš-Qĺispé story about a young 
weather being called Baby Out of Cut-Open Woman. His actions triggered the end of the last Ice 
Age about 12,000 years ago. 
 
So, this story, and all other American Indian and indigenous tribal stories, originated on this 
continent—or as I write in the poem, they “pushed up through this soil.” Unlike the stories in 
the bible or any other sacred text that serves as the basis for any historic religion now present 
in America, these tribal stories were not imported; they were not brought here from 
somewhere else. They were given to people right here and they are intertwined with and 
directly tied to this particular landscape. 
 
Part of the power of settler colonialism is that the concerted attempt by the invasive settler 
society to eliminate or replace indigenous peoples and their languages, their spiritual beliefs 
and virtually, cultures with settler ones, has been successful to a certain degree. 
 
However, despite that, you know, the concerted effort by the American government and 
citizenry to displace and destroy indigenous cultures, indigenous people and stories like the one 
in this poem have survived. And these stories have incredible things to teach all of us about 
living here in this place and also, you know, about how to be human.   
 
So, in the poem I write that although we can struggle to hear them, these stories and the places 
to which they are tied are very relevant and powerful and they are still here if we only listen for 
them.   
 
I end the poem by speaking directly to my own tribal community and reference my own 
personal experiences with the power of these stories. I write, “the crispness of Snlaq̓éy of 
Kʷĺncutn like fire / crackle the flick of sound a body remembers.”
