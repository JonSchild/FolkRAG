Delia on the Trapeze. 
IRISH SONG. 
'Written by Win. J. Scanlon. 
I 
have a 
charmer, she's my alarmer, 
Oh, what a 
pleasure to have such a 
treasure, 
I 
call her baby, she calls me deary, 
We p:u s 
all our time in a 
most pleasant way. 
When we're out for a 
walk the young men do say 
As we pass them by in thn street, 
Look at Lynch and his mils'', don't they cut a 
dash, 
Don't his darling look charming and sweet. 
Cnonus. 
But you should see Delia 
When on the trapeze, 
She'll stand on her head 
And she'll fall on her knees, 
She is a 
daisy, sets them all crazy, 
They lam_di and they shout ' till you'd think they 
would burst. 
Rept at. 
I 
brought my brother, his wife, and her mother, 
To the theatre, s-) they could mate her. 
When site came Out you'd think they would ate her, 
They shouted and yelled in a 
horrible way. 
When poor Delia heard it she looked with surprise, 
From the trapeze I 
thought she would fall, 
She turned a 
hip- flap, bounceu around on her hack, 
Ali, my how the people did hawi

If I 
Catch The Man Who Taught 
Her to Dance. 
Written, composed and sung 
W 
NI. J. 
SCANLON, 111 SCANLON & Cnoran's 
famous sketch, entitled 
Life in a 
Tenement House." 
I've got a 
daughter I 
talk to all day, 
But the devil a 
word will she mind what I 
say, 
In spite of advice she'll go far away, 
Sometimes she cannot be found. 
If I 
say stay at home, begorra shell get mad, 
She'll call me an mild tad, say I've got them bad, 
Inside of an oyster I 
ought to be clad, 
To a 
nannie goat I 
ought to be bound. 
Criouus. 
Ali, but if I 
catch the man 
That taught her to dance 
The la-de-da dance, the tr.:I-le-la dance, 
On the top of his nose I'll make my fist prance, 
And twist off the both of his legs, ha, ha ! 
(Repeat.) 
At night she'll put on her f&-de-loldols, 
Then she'll skip off to her picnics and balls, 
Then on the neighbors she'll make her grand calls, 
Borrow all the clothes that she can. 
For a 
bustle she'll wear my coderie pants, 
My chin- chilly vest, or anything by chance, 
But if I 
catch the laddie-buck that taught her to dance, 
twist. off the both of his legs. 
(Clurrus.) 
Written and composed by Win. J. Scanlon. 
You say you're going to leave me, love 
Farewell if we must part ; 
To see my darling go from me, 
I 
know twill break my heart. 
Goa knows I 
loved you better than life, 
For what i; life to me 
When you are gone and I'm alone, 
A poor outcast I'll be. 
Do not leave me, darling, 
Do not leave me here, 
We've happy been, we'll happy be, 
So do not leave me here. 
When I 
fail to see your face, 
My heart will ache with pain, 
From mine eyes the tears wi.1 drop 
Like the heavy falling rain. 
And when you cease to thing of those 
Whose love for you did burn, 
There will come a 
day that you'll repent, 
Then to me you'll return. 
(('horus.) 
I LOVE JAKEY. 
DUTCH SONG. 
Written tor Watson & Ellis by Wm. J. &anion. 
I'll sing of a 
Deitcher boy, 
A boy who loves me, 
You peoples must all know him well, 
He sells sausages in all the saloons, 
lie's the owner of a 
sausage hotel, 
lie can sing, he can dance, he can play the trombone. 
The finest you ever did see, 
Ile drinks lager beer to make himself fat, 
And he loves to eat good bologne. 
CHORUS. 
I 
love Jakey, I 
love ,Jakey, 
And Jakey he loves me, 
We eat pretzels, drink lager beer, 
Verc ever we may be. 
(Repeat.) 
To- night he is coining here to see me, 
Ve're going to a masquerade ball . 
Veit I 
am dressed up in my fancy clothet;, 
You bet I'm the belle of them all. 
And VelleVer my .Takey is by my side. 
how happy I 
always do feel, 
We sing the sweet songs of our faderland, 
Then around on this floor we do spiel.

1 went up to Barnum's a 
short time ago, 
The ei:cus of course there to see, 
The evening being tine and to spend a 
nice time, 
I 
brought my dear Josie with me. 
She seemed so delight«1 it made me feel good, 
My heart with joy it did beat, 
And when it was te. -er we started to go 
From the circus out into the street. 
Oh, my! wasn't it line, 
Oh. how the riders did shine, 
The clown lie was laughing, talking and chaffing, 
My little Josie she laughed all the time. 
Last night when we reached my dear ,Tosie's home, 
She said, now don't think me a 
bore 
If I 
ask you to call here again to morrow night, 
r1'0 the circus well go just once more. 
My answer was yes. of course, my dear Joe, 
What e'er your request it may be, 
1'11 grant it, my love, if it lies in my power. 
For my love it is always with thee. 
Next evening again to the circus we went, 
My Joste she looked like a 
queen, 
When the riders came out they all looked at her, 
She very much embarassed did seem, 
But, alas! she cried out to the man in the ring, 
My darling, I'm waiting for thee, 
She limped from my side to my great surprise, 
And every one there laughed at me. 
Cnottus. 
(Chorus.) 
Oh, my! why did she go ? 
Oh, why did she treat me so, 
She was my darling, always so charming, 
None in this world like my own little Joe. 
Wr4tteu by Wm. J. 
SCANLON. 
When e'er I 
thn:K of bygone days, 
And the happy times we had 
At home in dear ould Ireland, 
It makes my heart feel glad. 
When I 
think of my poor ould mother, 
And my father, all! how dear 
That sweet recollection is to mc, 
how I 
wish they were here. 
Cnottus. 
But now I 
am old, my life is quickly passing, 
Soon I'll he laid away o;(l in my grave, 
And my mother awl father's blessing I'll remember, 
That blessing to me which they joyfully gave. 
‘N as but a 
boy fifteen years old 
When I 
was left alone, 
To wander through this wild world 
Without a 
friend or home. 
I 
had to caul my living, 
And that. I 
did quite well, 
So when I 
meet with good old friends, 
Those things I 
love to tell. 
(Chorus.), 
Only to see you, darling, 
Only to hear your voice, 
Even it's faintest whisper 
Would make my heart rejoice. 
Vain'y I 
crave the sunshine 
Thy love would e'er impart , 
Longing once more to sue thee, 
Once more before we part. 
Crionus. 
Only to see you, darling, 
Only to hear your voice, 
Even Is 
1:11111( .51 whisper 
Would make my heart rejoice. 
Gone is the sunlit future, 
Vision of joy Si) bright, 
Now every gleam hath faded, 
Vanished in darkest night. 
Too late, alas! I 
knew thee, 
Ah ! could my poor heart tell, 
Breathe out it's bitter anguish 
In that sal word, farewell.

Tho' we often, etc. 
Oh, how soon we ale lug ft ten 
When the form I: cold cuid

Some, perhaps, will have a

When the Reaper calls min, 
But, alas! ' I

In this thankless world o: sin. 
As sung by R. II uNTING. 
Is there any one here that has got a 
desire 
To wed with a 
trimblesome wife? 
If they have, they had better put their head in the fire, 
And at () nett put an end to their life. 
When I 
marriel my love, I 
thought her a 
dove, 
But when marrid I 
wished myself dead, 
For in less than a 
week she got tired of love, 
And pulled all the hair out of my head. 
Oh. dear, &c. 
The first mishap, to my eyes did appear, 
She brought me home children two, 
And says, " you must father these two pretty dears 
Says I, " 
be blowed if I 
do !" 
Then she says, with a 
sneer, " how dare you presume 
To think of your case being hard ?" 
She knocked me down two pair., of stairs with a 
broom, 
And bolted me out in the yard. 
Now, before my song is done, I'll rub out as I 
run— 
I 
don't 
vi:5 11 the dear creatures to vex ; 
Every weld that I 
sp:tke, it was only a 
joke ; 
God bless them ! I 
love the NV1101 C sex. 
Boys, take my advice—gel spliced in a 
trice, 
And don't be of wedlock afraid ; 
And girls, do the same, go and alter your name. 
For ' tis shocking to die an old maid. 
Oh, dear, &c.

One summer's night ten years ago, 
The gang and brother Jim, 
Brought me down to the dock you know, 
To learn me how to swim. 
They tied a 
rope around my waigt, 
And then they heaved me in, 
To tell the truth, I 
was nearly drowned, 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
Swim out says Pete, arrali kick your feet, 
Go over- hand says brother Jim, 
The gang did shout as they dragged me out, 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
Oh ! ' chaw roast- beef, the beef is tough," 
The gang sung out to me ; 
They daubed my face with lumps of tar, 
I 
looked like a 
Chinee. 
I 
made back ,dives and somersaults, 
Along with Shorty Tim ; 
Both my feet were cut with copper nails, 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
(Chorus.) 
I 
was chock full of salt water, 
Brought to a 
liquor store, 
There they rolled me on a 
barrel, 
For two long hours or more. 
Sure they made me drink some brandy, 
I 
had the jim-jam-jams, 
I'll neer forget, as long as I 
live, 
The night I 
learned to swim.

Alasl death has entered that home, love, 
And robbed it of all that can cheer. 
I

And while I

I'll cherish thee to my heart.

Where death ne'er again can destroy.

No doubt you will wcnder why I 
dress so gay, 
Always in fashion this swell of the day. 
My clothes they are cut in the latest of style, 
And the darling young ladies on me fondly smile. 
My way is so winning, full of exquisite grace, 
Why they really do laugh when we meet face to face. 
The gents they all look with derision at me, 
Because I 
am always dressed up to a

Oh 
the darling young ladies say I

Why none's half so charming as Clarence Lavere. 
Dn a 
nice afternoon if the weather is fair, 
To my barber's Igo to curl up my hair, 
Brush off my clothes fix myself all serene, 
For I

I

I

I'LL sing of a 
band that used to play 
Music in the street, 
And if you heard it you would say 
It was anything but sweet. 
They all played different instruments, 
The music was the same, 
They were all one family, 
And Morgan was their name. 
CHORUS. 
Johnny Morgan played the organ, 
The father beat the drum, 
The sister played the tambourine, 
The brother went porn, porn, porn—porn, porn, porn, 
All alone on an old trombone; 
The music was so sweet 
They often got a 
penny 
To go into another street. 
They used to say that Johnny was 
The smartest of them all, 
And round the area windows 
lie would often make a 
call. 
His music was so lively, 
All the latest airs from France, 
The servant girls could not keep still, 
The music made them dance. 
John Morgan played the, etc. 
Now one day John he chanced to play 
Outside a 
lady's door, 
And the lady said she never heard 
Such music played before ; 
It pleased her so, that you must know, 
She heavy sums would pay 
To John, to stand outside the house. 
And play to her all day. 
John Morgan played the, etc. 
John played upon his instrument, 
And pleased the lady so, 
That when the time arrived to leave, 
She would not let him 
She asked if he would marry her, 
Which John did very soon, 
Now on the organ Johnny Morgan 
Plays her many a 
tune.

THE DAY I

My name it is McGinty, yes, 
I 
live on ham and flour, 
With O'Leary, the walker, I 
came here, 
For to walk a 
mile an hour, 
Abwit hall past twelve o'clock last night 
A 
gang gave me a 
terrible fright, 
They woke me up and set me tight, 
For to walk against O'Leary. 
They took me to a 
great big fluid, 
And with alcohol set me crazy, 
They stripped me clothes off to the skin, 
And it made me feel so lazy; 
Tt, was then the gang commenced to talk, 
Saying who is the terrier going to walk. 
Awl they said they would hang me if I'd bank 
When I 
walked against O'Leary. 
The first mile I 
walked my legs were weak, 
And the gang commenced to holler, 
They spiinkled salt upon the track 
And hit me with an iron dollar. 
All the other walkers were ahead, 
Eating sponge cake, pie and bread, 
0 
heavens, I 
wish that I 
was detal, 
When I 
walked against O'Leary. 
I 
walked until I 
catched the cramps, 
Around and around the track, 
All the ladies threw bouquets at me, 
There was a 
corn upon my back 
The judge told me it was time to stop 
As around the track like a 
chicken I'd flop, 
For the want of a 
whiskey I 
fnongli I'd drop. 
The day I 
walked against O'Leary.

Fifth Avenue George is a 
charmer, 
And every dear creature will swear, 
Of fashion he's always the leader, 
No gent with his style can compare. 
He leads an exislence of pleasure, 
While blest with a 
fortune so large; 
And every one gives the opinion, 
There's none like Fifth Avenue George. 
CrIORUS. 
Fifth Avenue George, Fifth Avenue George, 
Upon him the girls fondly smile. 
For fun and good cheer to the boys he is dear, 
He's the leader of fashion and style. 
He wears a " Knox " hat made to order, 
And his diamond can vie with the sun: 
A 
gold-headed cane he keeps twirling— 
As a 
swell he is " A No. I 
I" 
He can waltz like a 
girl in the ballet, 
And sing like a 
signor from Rome; 
In ev'ry grand parlor or ball-room, 
Fifth Avenue George is at home. 
Fifth Avenue, etc. 
He thinks every business is vulgar, 
Tie can't comprehend the hard times; 
His manner is very romantic, 
And he talks about poets and rhymes. 
He plays " philopene" with the ladies, 
And flirts with the belles all around; 
Each day on Broadway promenading, 
Fifth Avenue George can be found.

There was a 
man whose name was Dan, 
And a 
traveller gay was he, 
And every day he was away, „ 
But he always came home to tea. 
And the people knew, that whatever he might do, 
And wherever he might be, 
In India, or China, or in South Carolina, 
Ile always came home to tea. 
CHORUS. 
He always eitme home to Net. 
Wherever he might be, 
This man call'd Dan, 
This regular man, 
lie always came home to tea. 
He went ashore on the coast of Labrador, 
An he sailed to a 
city on the spree, 
And he caught a 
shiver, on the river Guadelquiver, 
But he always came back to tea. 
The next day Dan went off to Japan. 
Around by Tar-ta-ree; 
Oh, didn't he spoon, in the mountains of the moon, 
But he always came home to tea. 
He always, etc. 
A 
boat he took from " Tubbie Hook," 
To the Falls of Nia-ga-ree ; 
He walked the ridge of Brooklyn Bridge, 
But he always came home to tea. 
Ile would take the train, and cross the raging main, 
To that savage coast, Jer-see, 
Ills wife remark'd with pleasure, \ ht a 
family treasure,' 
lie always comes home to tea. 
He always, etc. 
To Tim-buc-too, with a 
very jolly crew, 
Ile would dine with a 
mis-sion-a-ree; 
Then in Tipperary, he would trip it like a 
fairy, 
But he always came home to tea! 
Then, up Broadway, he'd stop on his way, 
To far-off Flor-a-dee, 
Oh, there he would smile, with a 
festive crocodile, 
qui, he always came home to tea!

'Twas at a 
ball I 
first met my girl, 
The fairest in the land ; 
She had pearly teeth and a 
dimpled chin, 
And a 
little slender hand. 
She skipped around in mazy waltz 
As graceful as a 
fawn ; 
When the dance was o'er I 
asked Irene 
To walk out on the lawn. 
CHORUS. 
We sat by the brook and the stars shone bright, 
And we whispered words of love on that summer night. 
So we walked and talked till it grew quite late, 
But I 
know she has my heart ; 
Then I'll bless the day when we get wed, 
And from her I'll never part. 
Next eve we met, near a 
running stream, 
And I 
walked close by her side •, 
I 
told her then how I 
loved her so, 
And she said she'd be my bride. 
How happy I'll be all the while 
When Irene is my wife. 
We will have a 
cot by a 
babbling brook, 
And we'll settle down for life. 
How to Catch a 
Flea. 
As desdribed by DAN COLLYER. 
Don't be in a 
hurry and get frantic. 
Watch your chances. 
Take a 
two-foot rule and mea.sure the distance from your 
hand to the flea. 
Take your pencil and calculate the time it 
will take to pass your hand that distance, so you may be sure. 
Take a 
long breath. 
Aim to grab his hind leg. 
Nerve your-
self up, take a 
drink, make a 
ferocious grab, and if the flea 
strays off, continue the chase around the room until you 
tumble over the baby; then flee. 
Coolness. 
AT 
the theatre, one night, John Phcenix thought he saw an 
acquaintance sitting a 
few feet in front, and asked the gentle-
man between them to poke him with his cane. 
When he 
turned around John discovered his mistake. 
Fixing his at-
tention on the play, and affecting indifference of the vhole 
affair, he left the man with the cane to settle tho disturbance, 
and he, being wholly without an excuse, there was, of course, 
a ludicrous and embarrassing scene, during all of which 
Plu-enix was profoundly interested in the play. 
At last the 
man asked, indignantly : ' Did you tell me to poke that man 
with my stick ?" " Yes." " And what did you want ?" " I 
wanted to see whether you would poke him or not." 
"You LIE !" 
The tone was deep and sincere, 
Yet scarce had the words been spoken 
Ere a 
bludgeon and cranium met and embraced, 
And the Sixth Commandment is broken.

And I 
tell you what it's a

Beyant in Sensible Park. 
Oh, Sensible Park, &c. 
There's the eagle and the elephants, 
The tiger and giraffe, 
And to sec the tricks in the monkeys' cage, 
Begorra it would make you laugh. 
They have animals there from everywhere, 
And all the ropes and chains they tear; 
And that's the place to see the bears,

°TALLER 
AN, THE BRAVE POLICEMAN. 
A 
new a 
original song., 
written and sung by W ILLIAM SCANLAN, 
ill his new and ori ,rinal sketch entitled, " Wanted a 
Lod-
ger; or the Life of a 
Mulberry Street Policeman." 
My name is O'Halloran, and fro • 1 
Ireland I 
came, 
And since I 
came here I've gained great fame; 
The'captains and aldermen all know me well, 
And iii, herosim and bravery they can e;.fily tell; 
If at night on my beat I 
walk to and fro. 
The 1)1A-Itards they see me, arrah from me they'll go, 
To an alleyway or bar- room they'd run if they can, 
unoaus. 
For they all know well 
a 
brave policeman. 
Under the rose-bush, under the rose- bush, 
Picking the clover and picking the way, 
Under the rose- bush, under the rose- bush, 
lie asked Inc to kiss him, I 
did not say nay. 
Of modesty heedless, in fact it was needless, 
We sat by the side of that May- bedecked hedge, 
heard his confession of love and depression, 
lie asked for a 
kiss in exchange for the pledge, 
I 
never denied it, but then and there tried it, 
Beneath that brigltt-rose bush full I 
litrdei tell with bloom 
S') like the May flowers, which served as a 
bower, 
It seemed quite as sweet as the lovely perfume. • 
Under the rose- bush, 
e. 
At im's early dawning, I 
went there each morning 
To meet my romantic and strangely met swain, 
All mystery was banished, all secrecy vanished 
• 
Dear Ned vowed he'd love me again and again. 
We do not like walking, we much prefer talking 
Bon:sath that bright rose- bush, full nit-Ilene(' with wool..., 
So when to the altar I 
went without falter 
I 
had my dear Neil for a 
happy bridegrown. 
CHORUS. 
For as I 
promenade my heat at night through the street, 
; 
Pm admired by every young lady I 
meet 
You'll hear them all sigh as hard as they can, 
For they're all deep in love with this brave policeman. 
When I 
first catne from Ireland I 
was rather green, of course, 
But I 
very soon got smart when I 
went on the force; 
'Twas then I 
picked up, and my count* did show, 
And was greeted 110 matter where'er I 
did go; 
As we led the parade on Saint Patrick's day, 
You can bet we looked grand as we all marched away; 
My countrymen would shout " Hurrah for OTIalleran, 
lie's the pet of the force, and a 
brave policerran. 
For as I 
promenade, .tc. 
I 
was very slop promoted to a 
roundsman you see, 
And respected no matter whereeer 
be; 
They put sthripes on my arms to look solid and grand, 
I'r they knew I 
was a 
hero from dear Paddy's land; 
But it's very strange, my friends, if J
-don't soon be mayor, 
For there's not a 
man more able or fit for that chair, 
And providing they will, I'll do everything I 
can, 
To hould my reputation as a 
true Irishman. 
For as I 
promenade, Acc.

Then hi! lii ! clear the way, 
Here comes Captain Cuff. 
Sometimes a 
common fellow 
Of the lower order class, 
Will dare make some rude remark, 
Or mock me when I

And lots of vulgar little boys, 
They know ine well enough, 
And oft salute me as I 
pass, 
'With what cheer, Captain Cuff. 
Captain Cuff, etc. 
With darling eyes upon me, 
Through life I 
gaily march. 
My style shall be the stiffest; 
My motto shall be starch. 
Should my cuff and collar glory, 
Be ever gone and fled, 
You'll know that Captain Cuff's gone wrong, 
And his washerwoman's dead.

As sung by WILLIAM SCANLAN. 
(Air—" Pat Won't Go Home Till Morning.") 
It was only on the tenth of last November, 
That we heard the news we ever shall remember 
That the lire-king had east its burning embers 
O'er another fateil city in our land. 
As the woeful tidings flashed along the wire,

Fire! fire

In every breeze that passed us by, 
And all the world did heave a

Fervent prayers to heaven to aid, 
Before the fire in ruins laid, 
Fair Boston, beauteous city. 
And all through the terrible commotion, 
The wind blew a 
gale from on' the ocean, 
The brave firemen worked with all devoliin, 
To laugh at vaiir efforts yet it seemed; 
Anti soared with liery prayer still higher, 
O'er chimney top, steeple and church spire, 
Till ad was one vast name of fire, 
And the light around the horizon gleamed. 
Fire ! fire ! was heard, etc 
But who saved the city from a 
panic, 
From the rule of a 
fire-king too !yrannie, 
But the brave- hearted firemen anti medranic, 
The best and the noblest in the land ; 
Far brighter than t

Are the natures or those who live in song or story, 
Who rebuild the city to its former glory, 
And build her up, if possible, more grand.

DRAW IT MILD, 
Written and sung by W ILLIAM SCANLAN. 
Let's learn to temper our wishes, 
For there's many a 
thing we desire, 
Which on the morrow is worthless, 
And makes nature a 
vivid satire. 
Young men whose fathers are wealthy, 
In dissipation their hours do beguile; 
Get all you can from the old man, 
But remember draw it mild. 
llortt-s. 
For those who wish to be much in life 
My advice, to man, woman or child, 
Is, go it strong while you are young, 
But remember, draw it mild. 
To the blushing maid of sweet sixteen, 
At whom Cupid flings his dart, 
Love at first sight's not always right, 
And leads to an aching heart. 
To all who believe in passion divine, 
And out whom the fates have smiled; 
Love's filter use, but don't abuse, 
And remember, draw it mild. 
To all who would an evil shun, 
Be he defaulter or politician ; 
Honor or duty can't be bouglit, 
So give up sordid ambition. 
Or else like evil doers, 
Upon whom riches are piled; 
A day of recovery soon will come. 
Unless you draw it mild.

My name is Pat Delaney, I 
came from Tralee, 
I 
live in a 
great big tenement house, way up in Avenue C; 
There's a 
family lives next to me that keeps up a 
terrible roar, 
About Eileen Alanna and their aligns asthore. 
First their youngest boy, and then their eldest brother, 
All join in the chorus with the sister and his mother; 
When I 
get home at night, boys, I 
hear that terrible roar 
Of Eileen Alanna and their augus asthore. 
CHORUS. 
Working hard all day, I 
think it mighty hard, 
Climbing up a 
forty foot ladder, carrying a 
great big hod, 
When I 
get home at night, boys, to hear that terrible roar, 
Of Eileen Alanna and their aligns asthore. 
Early in the morning, before I 
do get up, 
Before I 
ate a 
mouthful, or before I 
drink a 
sup; 
They be singing in the hallway ' till my heart it is quite sore, 
About Eileen Manna and their augus asthore. 
If I 
had influence in the ward I 
do belong, 
I'd go and see the judge, and have him push their case quite 
rl mug. 
I'd have them all arrested, and that would stop their roar, 
Of Eileen Alanna and their molls asthore.

Written by W ILLIAM SCANLAN, and sung by SCANLAN &

Farewell, dear home, farewell to all 
The comforts of this world. 
We're ould, we're helpless and forlorn. 
In the street from our home we are hurled. 
A 
time was when joy ne'er left our home, 
Oh, ' twas then our poor hearts beat with glen, 
But now to the poor house we must go, 
The cause is poverty. 
CHORUS. 
May Heaven protect us day and night, 
Where ever we may he ; 
So to the poor house we must go; 
The CaltSe is poverty. 
I've looked for work, but all in vain— 
They say that I'm too ould, 
I've gone and begged from door to door 
To keep out the hunger and cold; 
But Mary, dear, when we are dead. 
And they ask what became of you and me, 
They can never say we robbed or stole, 
But died from poverty.

Don't think by my dress that I've come here to beg, 
Though the sharp pangs of hunger I 
feel, 
The cup of misfortune I've drained to the dregs, 
But I'm proud if I'm shabby genteel. 
A time was when swells who met me would say, 
Aim ! 
Harry, my boy, come and dine," 
But how when they meet me they look the other way, 
My company now they decline.

Oh, Willie, dear Willie, our mother is dead, 
Our mother whom we loved so dear; 
She's sleeping to- night in her cold, cold grave, 
No more will she be with us here. 
How happy we were when by the fireside. 
With mother we'd sit all alone; 
And what stories she'd tell to both you and I,

13ut now she has left our dear home. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, mother has gone to Heaven above, 
And there's one thing of you I 
would crave; 
As children should do for a 
mother so true— 
Put a 
headstone o'er her beloved grave. 
How often, when sickness kept us in our beds, 
Not a 
friend in the world could we find 
Half so good as our mother, who'd sit by our side, 
And to us be so gentle and kind. 
Yes, morning and night, she'd watch our sick brows, 
Never thinking of rest; 
But now she has left us alone hero to weep, 
And gone to the land of the blest. 
Yes, mother has gone, etc

I'm twenty long years in this land, 
For politicians I

Good evening to ye's, one and all. 
I

I 
suppose ye all will be surprised 
At what I'm going to tell. 
I've been travelling about the Ward all day, 
Not a 
pound of rags can I 
buy, 
Because that blackguard, " Paddy Welsh." 
Has been there on the sly-. 
But I'll take my oath that I'm a 
bloat. 
If I 
don't make him sick. 
The first time I 
clap my eyes on him 
I'll paralyze him with a 
brick; 
I'll twist his nose till the blood it flown, 
And me he'll remember, well. 
To come no more in the Sixth Ward, hollering 
Any ould rags or ould bottles to sell 
Now what's the use of all this fusSt 
Our reputation I'm sure we'd spoil 
To see le,; 
quarreling here like dogs, 
Two sons of the Emerald Isle; 
So let us shake hands and be good friends, 
This rivalry let us stop, and to bind the bargain 
Let us go and of whisky take a 
drop. 
But there's one thing we must bear in mind, 
That our rules are sobriety. 
Sure if they found out we drank ruin 
We'd be kicked out of the Society. 
So say no more but on we'll go, 
Or some one they might till; 
And we'll go about our business, hollering. [What l]

Over which our bark may sail, 
Do you think our hearts together 
Will ride smoothly through the gale?

Will I 
always be your darling ? 
Tell me honest, tell me true, 
If forever and forever 
I 
will be as dear to you? 
When the silver hair shall mingle 
With the curly locks of gold, 
And my face, careworn and Nvrinklcd,

When shall come life's harvest days ? 
Will the love be then as ardent, 
And the lips as fondly praise ?

One summer day, long, long ago, 
When I 
was a 
li tie fellow, 
A piper wandered to our door, 
Grey- headed, blind and yellow. 
And all how gla I 
was my young heart, 
Though the sky an t 
titan looked dreary, 
When I 
saw the stranger and his dog, 
Poor Pinch and Keoch O'Leary. 
And when he stowed away his bags, 
Crossed barred, green and yellow, 
I 
thought and said in all Ireland's ground, 
There's not so tine a 
fellow— 
Aml Fenian Burke and Shaun McGee, 
And Eily, Kate ithd Mary, 
Rushed in with panting heart to see, 
And Welcome Keoch O'Leary. 
Well, Keoch and Pinch slept well that night; 
And in the morning early 
lie woke me up to hear lint play, 
The wind that break the barley. 
Then he stroked my flaxen lair, 
And murmured Mack you deary, 
And how I 
wept when he said farewell, 
And think of Keoch O'Leary. 
Well, twenty Bummers have gone past, 
And June's rtd sun was sinking, 
When, a 
man, stood by my door, 
Of twenty sad things thinking. 
A

And at his tail a

American Fortanc-Ttiling Clzrds.—This im the k 
old-
est and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards: We have 
published It for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arranged and printed in series— Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each of these into K for King, g, for Queen, 
sad K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an-
Ewers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. 
Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

courting Cards.— This Serieb of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such e 
way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by 
--Heinen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which iniaht have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. 
The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties  -

The N. Y. Evening Hail writes 
" 
A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. Fisnnit's, 98 Nits 
sau street, %ailed the " Little Flirt." We 
cannot say that we recommend 
it to our youn g 
lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining " how, when and 
where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called 
flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: ' We have lately seen a 
neat tittle 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, call4d the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. J. FISHER, No. 98 Nassau SWet. It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the mean-
ing of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As 
there is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents 
might afford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to 
recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."
