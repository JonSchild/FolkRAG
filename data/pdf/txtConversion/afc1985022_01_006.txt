TEXT: 
IPs What I was sayin about the Yugoslavians, during the 1927 
(?) that was in ' 23 -- a lot of people left from down here 
because the high water stayed on the land and in the houses for 
so long, so they went to work across the river in the oyster 
factories and some of em drudgin oysters and they got to know 
these people real close -- the Marsellaires (?) and the 
Juritiches, in fact some of the Juritiches come on back with em. 
And they in turn settled on the island, and they raised families, 
and the (?) and the Juritiches, they got quite a few different 
families up there. 
MH: Do any of them live over here? 
IP: Yeah, they have the Juritiches moved over here. They 
married a girl from New Orleans, and his sister married a dentist 
from down the island and they raised a family down here 
LP: Juritiches is Yugoslav? 
IP: Juritiches is from overseas, yeah -- they were mixed 
with the Yugoslays, yeah 
MH: Have you ever done oystering? 
IP: Oysters? Some, but not that much. , We normally did a lot 
of trappin, and naturally fishin and what have you. I did some, 
but not that much. Normally, you had, some people owned trappin 
land, 
like we had 200 acres, so naturally we did trappin, and one 
time when you did catch oysters it was durin trappin season, so 
the people that was oysterin weren't trappin, and the people that 
was trappin weren't oysterin, so you had two different ways of 
makin a livin. Most of the Yugoslays and the people from (?) used 
to do a lot of drudgin, and some from the island 
MH: Did you ever trap in camps? 
IP: I've stayed in camps, but not to do any trappin. We had 
our trappin land just a little too close for that. But all our 
families did, yeah. They would camp for the winter. 
Uncle Joe 
and my aunt used to go every year to their camp for the winter, 
go and stay maybe a month at a time. 
MH: Did the different camps have names tb them?
, 
IP: Not in particular. They'd have the name of the area, 
like " Spanish Lake," and " Oak River." Oak River had quite a few 
camps. That's a pretty good settlement. They'd even raise crops 
and,everything. The ground was high enough -- that's why they 
called it Oak River -- they had a lot of oak trees and behind the 
oak trees they used to plough and they'd raise whatever you could 
raise during the wintertime. And then sometimes if they got in 
there early enough to pick moss fcir a livin they went ahead and 
raised a summer crop -- tomatoes and string beans and peppers and 
everything else. 
St. Bernard Parish 
;s 
MH: Did -,you ever trap' on the Barataria ^marshes? 
IP:.No, sure didn't. Very few of us trapped the Baratari&g`. 
Marshes. Most of our trappin was done on our own private land, 
but a lot of times if we had a big storm that would destr 
the 
animals then we'd trap in Conarva (?) bac k here. 
MH: How often was there a big storm? 
IP: Sometimes you might pass six, seven, eight, ten years 
without a big storm. Your fur-bearin animals would multiply and 
you'd have good trappin seasons. We'd have seasons where to catch a 
hundred rats a night was nothin. You'd catch a hundred animals 
just about every night if the weather was like it is now. And a 
good trapper will skin about two, two and a half pelts a minute. 
With a knife, you cut from back leg to back leg and then you 
turn it and cut over the tail and then you turn it inside out, 
just like you take a jacket off, and you pull both front legs out 
the fur, you pull, you cut both ears, you pull again, you cut 
both eyes, then you pull it and turn it. By that time you got the 
fur all the way up your hand so you just pull it and turn it 
inside out. Yeah, we had seasons where a man -- an individual'd 
catch maybe 3,000 animals in about a three months period. That 
would be the season. You can only catch em when they're in their 
prime. They mostly travel underground when it's hot. You've got 
to have the cold weather for the pelt to be in prime, and for 
you to be able to catch em. 
They build their houses like hills. You've seen the pictures 
at the museum 11slenol. You seen the little muskrat hill? Well 
they'd have a hill maybe 3 - 4 feet high. And then each nest 
would have approximately -- when you go check your land, a good 
trapper can tell more or less what he's gonna catch. You can 
catch -- you're figurin on catchin approximately 8 rats out of 
every nest. 
I'm talkin about prime rats. 
MH: How many rats live in each nest? 
IP: Approximately 8 -- you see, you've got these things have 
a lot of big litters -- not necessarily big, 
but it'll be every 
three months they'll have a litter when the conditions are right, 
and you'll have about four to a litter, so, and then in another 
three and a half, four months, the ones that were small will 
reproduce again, so you can see that when everything's right, 
when the weather conditions are right, you've got a lot of three 
corner grass, which is the best feed for the rats, then the 
trapper can never catch enough rats to where they won't multiply 
and double the following year 
We count the nests -- you cannot see the animals in the 
daytime. You can walk the marshes all you want, but you can never 
see a muskrat. 
MH: What about tools? 
IP: Well, you bQy the best knife you can buy, -- the case 
was the best knife they had, but now the case doesn't make'the 
number one red anymore. I still have a case knife here. 
In fact 
I've got some of the knives that used to belong to my 
grandfather, and ray father, I've still got their knives. 
MH: Are they pretty worn down? 
IP: some of em -- they'd wear em down to where they couldn't 
use em -- then you had the wringer. Once you skinned the rat, 
in 
order to take whatever remainin meat and what have you out ofrit 
2 
LFPAMH005 
-- that used to be her job -- you'd pass it through a wringer.•_So 
by the time you get home, if you catch a hundred rats, you've 
already skint em , -- that used to be a sun- up to sundown, 
basically. 
LP: People used to say, " Oh how can you do that?" I'd say, 
"When you're lookin at it, you don't think of it as a rat, you 
think of it as a dollar." That was our livin you know. 
IP: Well the three winter months governed what you was gonna 
make the rest of the year. 
MH: Is that wringer used any where-else in the country for 
that? 
IP: It used to be the old-time clothes wringer, and then 
they made them all to pass muskrats, because they went to a 
washing machine -- I still got a couple of em back there. You'd 
tighten the machine. You could overtighten it too, and you'd make 
the pelts too light, and then they lose value. 
MH: And that was so you wouldn't have to scrape them? 
IP: You don't scrape muskrats. You scrape nutrias, but the 
nutria's an animal that came here later. We never had any nutrias 
to begin with. We had the mink, the otter, the muskrat, the 
coon, and the possum, and that was about it. 
MH: What kind of sets did you use for muskrat? 
IP: That was what they called a victoria number 1. 
Then they 
got number 3 that was used for nutrias later. Then they had what 
they called an oyster trap they used to catch otters, which is a 
very strong trap because an otter's a strong animal, they're 
short but they're very powerful. So you had to trap the otter 
with a different kind of trap -- what we called the oyster trap„ 
a double spring job. 
You set the traps, what you're lookin for is runs. When 
you're trappin, the trappFA that traps and tries to take care of 
his land, he never sets his traps too close to the nest. He 
doesn't want to catch the mother nest where the mother has little 
ones. They avoid that to begin with. She's what they call a flat 
-- she don't have much pelt on her, much fur. One reason is she's   
nursin the little ones. So you'd keep away from the nests, and 
you don't catch her -- and the little ones they don't get too far 
away from the nests, and then you set the traps with a certain 
amount of tension, so that the little one will not fall in the 
trap. Oh, now and then you can't help it, 
but you avoid catching 
d  
the little ones if you can. 
A good trapper can tell just by lookin at the hole or the 
run whether it's little rats or big rats, not necessarily by the 
V 
footprint, but by the way they ate. The little ones, just like 
kids, are mischievous, they'll tear up everything, and turn it 
upside down, where the big rat'll get out the holes, and go 
apiece and eat and then come back. So when you see it all tore,up 
around the hole you know it's a small rat and you leave it alone 
-- but the joke is that the big rat doesn't run where the little 
one does, as a rule, and the little one doesn't necessarily 
travel where the big rat travels. I guess it's their way of 
surviv in. The little ones'll stay close to the nest, and the 
mother rat' 11=- stay with em. 
And you see, when it's gonna rain, a trapper can tell about 
12,hours before that it's gonna rain. 
If you go that mornii and 
3 
1 
LFPAMH005 
you see these nests that's all worked, covered with mud and new 
grass, you can rest assured that come night it's gonna rain. 
MH: Are there other ways to tell, 
like with birds or 
something? 
r 
IP: Well, 
if we're gonna have a heavy storm, somethin that's 
gonna give us trouble, the birds don't stop in the woods and rest 
down by the island. Hurricane Betsy, the morning before it hit 
us, we went out fishing, in fact we caught,a pile of fish, and 
when we come in, the old man Torres said " You all crazy or 
somethin? We got a hurricane starin us in the face" But the 
birds, what they were doin, they were comin in, 
but they wasn't 
stayin on the island woods, for some reason they knew that it was 
too strong for them to survive. They would pick up and come on 
further up until they got to real high ground. 
Yeah, the birds know. Same thing with shrimp when you're 
trawlin, 
if it's your last drag in the evenin, somewhere around 
3:30, 4:00, 
if you catch the shrimp and they're red, red just 
like fire red, well you know, the old timers, the old captains, 
would tell us, well let's go look for a harbor, cause we're gonna 
have a storm blow tonight. 
It could be just like now. 
I've seen 
it many times. Not leaf or a blade of grass is movin. They said, 
"Well, tonight we've gotta find a harbor, because we're gonna 
have a storm blowin sure enough. Latta times they say, well, 
maybe tomorrow we won't be able to work because they'll be too 
much wind. You look at the sky, you say, well that's impossible, 
you know. But then you look at the shrimp, now when you catch em, 
after a while they turn back to the original color, 
in other 
words it'll turn just like any other shrimp that's been dead for 
a while. When you first catch ern they'll be cherry red, when 
they're cherry red look for harbor, because there's gonna be a 
st orm. 
MH: Are there any sayings about that? 
IP: Not any sayings that I can remember, about the shrimp. 
(passing food around) Yeah, we catch -- you can tell by the 
animals most of the time what's gonna happen, most of the time. 
The old timers did. That was the only method they had of keepin 
track of the weather -- 
what was gonna happen. A lot of times 
you see the fish will do the same thing. A lot of times, 
if you 
predicted a cold coming, a front, and they'll tell you, well 
it'll be here tomorrow. If you go fishin and the fish don't bite 
today, they'll be no cold tomorrow. It's bein delayed somewheres. 
the fish'll feed the day before a northwester -- the day before 
cold weather, they'll feed like crazy, cause they know that they 
won't be able to eat for a couple of days, on account of the 
weather conditions. But if you go up and listelh'to the radio, a 
lot of times we listen to the radio, or the television, and we'll 
go up, well tomorrow -the nor' wester's comin, today the fish" ll 
feed. You get out there and the fish don't bite, forget it. 
There's no nor wester comin. the next day you go and they'll tell , 
you, well the nor' wester's delayed, may not get here, and the 
fish start bitin, I mean bitin like crazy. You can come on in and 
wait. The nor' wester' s comin in. 
They don't miss.  See, before the 
(7) we went huntin, and the fish were feedin like crazy, and ._ 
actually, we should have had our rods and reels instead of our. 
guns, because the gnats were so bad -- we killed four or fivej 
U 
4 
I 
LFPAMH005 
ducks, I took my grandson to let- him shoot. 
If I'da been by 
myself I coulda killed that in a little while, ,but lettin him 
hunt was the reason I went. 
MH: and he got some? 
IP: He got three I believe. 
MH: Is that pretty good for him 
IP: 
It is in a way, because I'm just tryin to teach him the 
safety aspects 
of it. 
I'd rather have him,on the safe side than 
necessarily -- I don't want him to shoot out of gunning range. So 
you try to teach him- when to shoot and when not to shoot. When 
they pass out of gunnin range, leave em go 
MH: Will he be a good hunter? 
IP: I think he will. See, the first duck he killed was last 
year, when he was eight. And I mounted it for him. I hung in on 
the wall with a plaque " The first duck killed by Scott Noonez, at 
the age of eight" Blue Winged Teal. And he shot it with a full 
ten on the fly so that was a lucky shot in a sense because the 
kid wasn't used to huntin. 
MH: The miniature camp in the museum, what time period is 
that from 
IP: The time period from around the twenties to about the 
fifties, I guess, or sixties. See the reason they would be 
campin g there weren't any fast boats. So in the family, 
if they 
wanted to be in the marshes at daybreak, they had to leave the 
house too early. 
In other words, 
if you had to leave home say 
12:30, 
1:00 at night in order to get over there at daybreak, 
it 
was too much. Too big of a hassle, and then when you'd finish 
trappin it would be at sundown or even later. 
I've seen times 
when, sunup, when I could barely see the cane, 
I'd start runnin 
my traps, then the last trap would be just' about time for the sun 
to be already set. So actually if you wanted to do that every day 
you just couldn't survive. So they'd build their camp. 
We build many camps, or helped people build them. See my 
father had a fairly good sized boat, so we used to take -- get 
the lumber for ern, 
like M 
Perez and some of the Thibodaux's 
and what have you, and then we'd help em build a camp 
MH: So what did a camp usually have in it? 
IP: 
It would have a kitchen, a -- normally it would be one 
big room to sleep in. 
Just a regular camp, that's all. The 
outhouse would be in the back. 
It would be made out of, nothin 
real fancy -- tarpaper and wood, and a window -- they'd take 
regular windows and take em out there. Doors -- lot of times 
they'd make their own doors 
LP: Wooden stoves? 
IP: The heaters were mostly wooden stoves'.' Later`on they 
were petroleum. See I got a first cousih•that -- there was nothin 
impossible for her. In other words, she used to run her traps --
she'd run the traps with her husband, when it came time to 
trawlin g she'd make the nets for him, and she took a regular 
washin machine, took it out there, put it on the wall, hooked 
what they call an air cool motor on it, and used it to where she 
could wash with it. Which was very unusual because she got this 
motor to work. She rigged up her own washing machine with a 
gasoline motor and a washing machine. 
You do the best you could. She had seven sons. 
LFPAMH005 
•.-MH; The camp had bread baking, cooling in the window 
IP: They used to bake their own bread, cook whatever you -
brought up, so that 's the reason they 'd come in once a month --
to bring the pelts and sell em, and to stack all the provisions, 
and sometimes you'ftd furbuyers that would go out there to buy 
the rats, see, to buy the hides, well they in turn would take out 
provisions, fresh bread and what have you, and give it to the 
trappers so that they would sell their rats to em. 
It was nice 
because each family had a fur buyer that they catered to, or 
catered to them. And they sold to this particular man, they= 
wouldn't sell to nobody else as long as this man was payin the 
same price as the rest of em, see? 
We used to have a fellow by the name of Joe Srob (?) used to 
buy all our rats. And a lot of times he'd come home and he'd say, 
well how many rats you got? My father would name a figure -- the 
old man would say, well, I got eleven hundred and some rats, 
which would be two of us, and Joe would say, well, just throw em 
in the sack, and give you a dollar sixty, seventy five or 
whatever they were worth. And the old man would say, well you 
gonna count ern? He said " no" and the old man said " Oh yeah, you 
gonna count em. I won't sell em to you unless you count em." he 
said " Put I know you honest." He said " That ain't the case. 
If I 
leave you go from here without countin the rats and somebody 
hooks you somewhere down the line, you gonna be wondering. You 
count em." He says, " Old man, 
if I count your rats I might lose 
somewhere down the line." the old man says " I don't care. 
If you 
gonna buy em, you gonna count em." He felt like his name was 
worth more than the rats, you know. That's the way people felt 
down there. They were proud of bein able to pay their A- 1-4-
not to owe anybody. Pretty independent. 
MH: So people would do everything out there in the camp, 
even their wash. 
IP: (hat's why we used to laugh, because they used to have 
what they called a scrubbing board, and we used to say that one 
a 
time they never had no fat women, cause that extra side on the 
scrubbin board was keepin them in shape." And, yeah, People used 
to wash with the scrubbin board, hang em out on the line, 
if a 
wind came along and knocked em down they had to rewash ern again. 
(laughs) 
MH: All that mud 
IP: Oh yeah. You take a trapper, a trapper'd go out there. I 
was one of the ones that didn't get too dirty. when I was young. 
But some of those trappers looked like a chunk of mud when they 
come out the prairie. 
Well I don't go out there to rub myself With fish and put em 
on my lap and all that kind of -- but you can do -- trappin was 
fun. 
I'd rather trapr-than eat in the wintertime. We used to every 
winter. You look at somewheres around three or four thousand 
animals that you would catch in a three month period, and that 
would have to last you. That's why they considered fishin crabs 
one of the lowest Jobs you could do. They had a bad winter -- the 
winter we had a storm that year, and they had to fish crab in 
order to feed their families, and- that 'was a rough job. They used 
to put out a line, 
it would be maybe a mile 'or so or a little 
less, and then you had to run it, 
Pullin by hand, in a ikiff, ;,you 
6 
LFPAMH005 
had to scoop up the crabs -- that 's an art in.4f—I 
because 
when you scoop up a crab, you got three choices -- you got to 
tell if it's a skinny one, and it goes in one basket; if°it's a 
fat one it goes in another one; and if it's ready to shed;_:zor if 
it's a buster, 
it goes in another basket. You got three baskets, 
see, and it's about that fast. When you hit the crab like a 
tennis racket -- you want it as shallow as you can use it withou 
having that crab get away from you. 
SIDE TWO 
IP: You need to solve this in conservation in many ways with 
you shrimp, your crabs, your fish, your muskrat, and especially 
your ducks . The limit is not what hurt. Course the limit is five. 
Hut what hurts is shootin outa gunning range. Same thing with the 
mosquito control. See we need to take that out completely . That's 
our biggest enemy. 
MH: Tell me more about that. 
IP: Well, the mosquito control, they use this oil- base spray 
-- these melothyoline (?) or whatever else they use , well it's 
bad for the ecology. You spray it out in the marshes , they been 
sprayin the marshes with it, with the planes , they spray it over 
the highways , and it got to the point where not even the farmers 
are bein able to raise their crops without havin problems. The 
shrimp -- you lose your first crop of shrimp every year. 
LP: And you know who to blame for that? 
MH: Who? 
LP: The city folks. Every time one mosquito bite ern they go 
and complain so they go to the mosquito control -- and they spray 
the countryside . And the countryside is where the people make 
their natural livin 
IP: That's right 
11 
LP: And they're destroyin the countryside 
IP: We had to pass a petition, her and I, 
and we stopped 
for about eight or ten years. 
MH: And did the marshes start coming back? 
IP: Well, 
in a year's time, believe it or not, 
in a year's•"• 
time we had the marshes almost back to what they were . And they 
stayed this way for years, and now all of a sudden they started 
sprayin again - sprayin with these planes, out of r.11 aquemines, 
out of St. Bernard. I complained to the head of the police jury a 
few months back. They stopped it for a while, but I'm sure 
they're gonna start it back up. And this is what hurts . It got to 
the paint where you couldn't even make what we call makin soft-
shelled crabs -- you put the soft -shelled crabs in the boxes on 
the canal and you get coupla heavy rains and all your
rcrabs would 
die. All this pollution, all this trash would be floatin down the 
canal, you see. And . she can tell you, before Juan 
-- okay, the 
hurricane, hurt -- but, the animals were already on 'a decline 
when that happened because of the mosquito control. You could go 
back there and I could show you, you walk the marshes and the 
grasshoppers would be all over you , and right before this 
hurricane, her and I went to try to catch minnows and I walked 
part of the marshes, and I come back to the boat , and I told her, 
I said, " You won't see a grasshopper nowheres . Someth 
i 
n' 
s wrong. 
Something 's killing these things ." And if it's killin that it's 
LFPAMH005 
killin everything else. Never had any minnows, hard to catch,a5 
minnow. Never had any grasshoppers, could hardly see any birds. 
All this was bein hurt. 
LP: They got the idea that mosquitos are going to spread 
'
-disease and stuff -- I remember a time we lived with the 
mosquitos that were so thick that you couldn't get out in the 
yard, you couldn't breathe. It's gotten to the point -- I think 
they can destroy by over - emphasizing on some of these things. 
Because they do spray the marshes, and they go by plane. And you 
can see the fur industry decline every year, every year. And 
before this storm came there were none. 
IP: The storm didn't destroy animals. 
It was already 
destroyed. They destroyed it with the mosquito control. 
LP: and what happened, the little people, you don't have no 
say so. You complain to the police ,jury. Your police ,jury they 
listen with a deaf ear. They're fightin one another for power 
more than what they're  fighting  for people. They're actually 
fighting for power. 
IP: They're fighting for the almighty dollar -- right now 
you've got a war gain on in a sense. It's not a war but it's a 
controversy that's pretty big. 
It's between the sports fishermen 
and the regular fishermen. Believe me, the regular fisherman is 
not hurtin the sports business. 
But what's really hurtin it is 
the purse seines -- the ones comin out of Florida. These are the 
ones that are destroyin everything. the regular^ fishermen, 
they've got a three-inch mesh, or four and a half, whatever it is 
right now. This mesh, the only thing it can catch is the redfish 
and the drum and the sheephead. They don't catch but maybe 7S-100 
pounds a day. So they're not hurtin -- this is very small. You 
can take a line on a given day and you can catch that. Most of 
the days anyway. But you take these purse seines comin out of 
Florida, they come into these waters here, and they in turn use 
spotter planes to spot the schools of big fish -- redfish and 
drum, and these are the fish that are gettin ready to spawn. 
They'll go and close ern in, they're usin what they call a purse 
seine, which is also a mullet seine, and the mesh is real small. 
Well they kill everything. Nothin goes through the mesh, whereas 
the regular small fisherman, the meshes are big enough to where 
all your undersized -- a trout has got to be over five pounds 
LP: They bought the guys that made the laws -- so then they 
made the laws to fit the guys 
IP: It's a big business, they got their lobbyists. I'm sure 
that directly or indirectly they're payin our senators and 
representatives to pass these laws. So what they did they passed 
a law that yo u cou ld n 't leave nothin unattended:' Now these small 
seines -- these smal 1, gi l 
l nets, you've got to Xeave there 
overnight. But in order to make it look good for the.public 
you couldn't leave no seine unattended, or no nets. 
It didn't 
hurt.the purse seiner any because they don't leave nothin 
unattended anyway. But when they close in, they kill everything 
that's in that given area. And they use spotter planes 
LP: Remember that bl ack redf ish at the market, that recipe? 
This guy that made that recipe famous, what they call a black and 
red fish -- there's a'recipe, it's big all over the country. So 
that's why they're down here with these big purse seines catchin 
NA 
•• 
LFPAMH005 
every redfish. And we,:had our police jury to tell- us- that these 
spotter planes that spot these fish before the boats put these 
purse seines out --- and he said he knew it to be a fact •that they 
caught so much fish that he had to call,4n two other big boats to 
load up these redfish, and then he said they left ern stacked up 
on the shoreline . He said it was unbelievable 
IP: In other words they had too much. 
LP: The bull reds 
IP: That's your breeding stock -- if you killed every woman 
that's pregnant you wouldn't have any kids. 
(more on the black and redfish recipe hype) 
IP: Well they destroyed Florida. they left Florida fishless. 
I was told that this particular man that's the head of this 
outfit, he said, "Give us four years and we'll leave Louisiana in 
the same condition that we left Florida: fishless." Now that's a 
hell of a statement to make. 
In olden times , when I'm talkin to 
you fifty years ago, these people couldn't have survived down 
here because these people would have made sure they didn't. 
They'd have taken the law in their own hands, which is wrong in a 
way, but it's the only law they knew then. 
LP: It was the law of survival 
IP: Would you believe that I can remember down on the island 
when you never had no law but the law of the few men that 
controlled it, 
in other words they took the heads of the smartest 
individuals, or the people that were energetic and they made them 
into leaders. And they controlled what was good for the people 
and what was bad. And she can tell you that her daddy would say 
"Don't go down on the island cause the island people are rough, 
you know." But it wasn't that they was rough. They managed things 
the way they saw fit. 
In other words, 
if you went down there you 
was a stranger. My grandfather was one individual that would give 
you the shirt off his back. My poor grandma never knew who he was 
going to bring home to . eat, because if he seen somebody along the 
bayou, he'd invite em in to sit at his table and eat. 
If somebody , 
fell overboard or somethin, he carne home and got clothes to give 
them. But what they didn't understand was these people had to 
make a livin -- all able bodied men would leave the island, say 
for instance at 12:30, 
1:00 at night, so if a stranger came in 
there at sundown or during the day, there would be a group of men 
would come to meet him . If he was roamin around the island, 
like 
if he didn't know anybody, he didn't belong there. They would 
come down to meet him: " Well, who are,you with?" If he couldn't 
give the right answers, they'd tell him, " Weil, leave , leave now 
before sundown." But only because the women and children stayed 
there by themselves . We didn't know what a locked door was. 
If 
they had a front key ,for the door, I didn't know about it, 
because we never did"close it. And if you knew anybody down there 
and"you went down there you was welcome as long as you wanted to 
stay.. But they didn 't want stragglers that were apt to do harm to , 
the women and children 
LP: You had vagabonds, you had street people. 
If they would 
see'someone like that they would be in fear of that
.person 
IP: They'd put em on a shrimp truck -- they wouldn't hurt 
him -- I've never known em to hurt anybody. But they've got a, 
reputation for this ,, see. They'd put em on a shrimp truck and.

LFPAMH0054 
they'd bring em up here and maybe bring em to the French M 
or 
something and turn em loose. Don't go down there. 
LP: What would happen is hoboes would get down there and 
they would actually be lost, and they would get down there and 
that would be the end. 
IP: Yeah, 
a had a sign down there " The end of the world." 
You couldn't get any 
ur _ ;­ho£ by car anyway. You had to go by 
boat. 
You could go to Cuba if you wanted to, 
but you had to go 
by boat. 
M 
they helped each other. Anything that's needed, even 
to this day, 
if a person dies, they'll pass what they call a 
"limon" (?) a collection -- to help this individual. 
If a person 
got sick, when I was a kid, the neighborhood, the whole island, 
would pitch in so much -- in order to go to town when I was a 
baby, 
it was a two-d a y tr ip. One day to go,' and one day to come 
back. 
I'll tell you how we had highways down there. As a kid we 
used to set bird traps, you know these little red bird traps, 
we'd set em on the highway. 
MH: What were they like? 
IP: Well you had two different -- what they call a " trivise" 
(?) was, they had one made with wings and you put a bird in it --
that was to catch the pops, the red pops, and you could catch a 
red bird with that too, and the other would come flyin in, you 
put a bird in it 
(his aunt Leontina comes in) 
but what you did was you put a ground trap out, but what we 
used to do as kids, -- there was nothin else to do really -- so 
we used to make what they called a ground trap. You'd burn a 
little given area, and you feed it, 
while you set on the highway, 
the birds used to get on the highway like crazy, and you'd set 
this ground trap with a string and a trigger, and when a bird got 
in it, 
he'd touch the string and the trigger would trip, and the 
trap would fall and we'd catch him. Then we'd take that bird and 
keep him, 
for a while, and then we'd put him in what they called 
a " trivesil" M 
or cage with wings on it, 
and put triggers on 
the wings, and then you'd go set it out there, and after a while 
this bird got to the point where he would sing, and when he 
called the other ones in -- the male would come to fight him, and 
held fall in the trap. 
MH: And they were good to eat? 
IP: Not necessarily. We used to catch ern as kids and turn em 
loose and keep em for a while, and feed ern, 
what have you. Just 
kidstuff, you know. But I've seer, traps set out there after you 
pass the last grocer's store, you could set traps and they would 
stay there for fiv e or s ix days a week and nothing would run ove r 
em, because they wouldn't have no traffic. 
So, 
it was a good life. Mosquitos, they had mosquitos like 
you wouldn't think about. 
MH: Do martins help keep the mosquitos under control? 
Ip: I'll tell you what keeps the mosquitos under control is 
your mosquito hawk -- you know what a mosquito hawk is? No? It's 
a --- dragon flies is what they call -- we call a mosquito hark. 
You see the marshes too, they'd have plenty of rnasquitos one day 
and all of a sudden, every blade of grass would have a dragon fly 
on it. And in a day or" so they wouldn't have any more mosquitos. 
Hut here's something else that the mosquito control does, 
it"",

came up .they 
have an open field. 
LP: They're ruining the cycle of everything that takes care 
of one another. 
IP: Yeah, well,"-'when you kill a mosquito you kill 
the 
larva of the mosquito feeds your minnows. The minnows feed your 
fish. The fish in turn feed your people. Look, the day that ocean 
is dead, we're dead. Cause the land's dead.. The land'll be just 
on the verge of not bein able to produce. That's why we need laws 
to stop em from what's goin on now. Sometimes you need people-= 
that'll fight for what they're thinkin, and when they do that, 
they're looked down on, really. 
f 
MH: What kind of vegetation is on that miniature trapper's-
camp? 
IP: Outside you had what they call " Pyphine" (?) grass, you'd 
have what they call the Mango bush, which is where your birds 
nest and what have you, then you got what they call the three-
corner grass. 
camp) 
(Louise poin. ts out that his aunt s pent a lot of time at the 
LP: I'll tell you how hard some of these people used to 
trap: The wife would put a lantern on the window or on top the 
camP for the husband to find his way back, that's how late it 
was. 
MH: He'd be that far away? 
IP: He'd be maybe a mile or two, and he couldn't see out 
there. 
It used to be total dark. 
MH: How did they get the wood to build the camp? 
IP: You bought it, you'd have a truck bring it on the 
island, and then you'd put it on a boat. Ahd everything would be 
done by hand out there, everything would be done by saw, --
they'd have their families to help them, then you had to move 
everything into the camp; and at the end of the season you'd take 
everything out the camp, except maybe your beds, you left that 
there. You brought your provisions, your little woodstove -- your 
molds to hang the rats -- you seen that at that [ miniature camp] 
-- each trapper would have five or six hundred of em, maybe to a 
thousand. If he were a big family he'd have a lot more. 
In other 
words, 
if you caught a hundred rats a day, and you ran into a 
cycle with bad weather, for instance, you might get rain for two 
or three days. Now these rats have got to be dried in the sun, 
and in order to dry ' em in the sun it.takes about a day and a 
half, two days, so you gotta have enought stretchers and molds to 
last you for maybe four days or a'week_.-- in case it rains. 
If 
you let em, they'll go bad on you, 
if you didntt take care of em, 
the hides would go bad on you. You'd lose'your catch. You could 
lose three or four days work. That's why, you seen it on the wall 
there, they had em strung up, the pelts after they were dry, they 
strung em up'and hung em on the wall? That's to air em out. Well 
you go through ern, 
every so often, 
if You're gonna keep em a week 
fo- instance -- sometimes you keep em a whole month -- accordin 
to the prices. So me ti mes you waitin for, like for instance, they 
used to trap, 
in the beginnin of the season -- they weren't worth 
much, the pelts. And then the competition ,lust started goin 
between the fur buyers. Most of your fur buyers were from,-.r 
LEPAMHOO5 
different places in the parish, or even ' the state, and they in 
turn bought for different houses, so the competition would get a 
little vicious, and they'd keep -goin up on the muskrat. 
So you'd try to keep em maybe sometimes for six or eight 
weeks, and what you did, you'd buy a little brush, and you'd run 
your hand through em, every three or four days, five days, a 
week, you'd run your hand through em to see if they was mildewed 
-- and you took that brush, you passed the-
brush to clean em, and 
it made the fur stand out, you see. And you'd take a little rag 
with some kerosene or something, and you took all the mildew off. 
So that's somethin else that you had to watch. The reason you see 
em hangin up on the camp walls is to air em out, to keep em from 
gettin mildewed. 
Last year we trapped, I got some Pelts there that I forgot 
to sell, we set aside. 
MHz Are they still good? 
IP: Yeah, they're good. I don't think you'd want to buy ern. 
We were going to throw them away, I said, naw, 
leave em, we'll 
give em to the museum or someplace -- a few muskrats, and a 
couple of nutrias. They're a little overdry. 
I used to love to trap because it kept your weight down. 
You'd lose twenty or thirty pounds in a season 
MHz Do you eat muskrats? 
IP: I don't, but a lot of people do. 
MHz How do they prepare them? 
IP: You stew ern down, or you fry the legs, naturally 
you 
got to 
LP: You have to smother ern down like you do a pot roast 
IP: That was somethin else that the trapper did. We had one 
season for fishin nets that we used muskrats for bait to fish 
crabs. 
It was the season right after trappin season, when it 
started gettin warm. We used to take barrels and salt the rats 
down. You'd put all your rats in the barrel. You'd take ern and 
Just gut ern, 
and put ern a 
l 
l in layers and salt em down, t 
i 
t you 
got a barrelfull of rats. You'd bring your rats in instead of 
throwin em away. You didn't want to pollute your land anyway with 
rotten rats, dead rats. So what you did, you brought ern in. N 
sometimes we used to br ing em in and give em to different peoopw 
le 
wanted to eat em . 
LP: The black people used to eat ern. 
We couldn't give enough 
to black people 
IP: No, they're still crazy about ern. 
But there's a lot of 
white people too. 
LP: but mostly black people 
MHz Do black people do any trapping? 
IP: Not too much. Over here you had a couple of families. 
Down the island they -had Harold Robinson used to trap for my 
uncle, my great uncle. 
. 
MHz There's a group of people living down on the tip of 
Plaquemines Parish, they're supposed to be all trappers. 
IP: I don't know any more. Down the island they was all 
trappers. The drudgin wasn't done by the trapper. You had an 
oyster season too. See, the oysters breed too, they go into milk."'. 
When they net - i l l- y, 
they' re not edible. We don't eat ern. 
Now 
they'll take and dress em up and sell ern to outsiders. They'll 
LFPAMH005 . 
get a milky, gritty taste. We don't fool with em. 
If there+ ,s an: 
r 
in the season, we' 11 eat em then. See in May, and June, and July, 
and August, we don't fool with em. When they get back in 
September then they're past the cycle, see. 
"" ( more on this) 
LP: There was very few people down there that didn't own the 
marshland, but that was the people that did the drudgin, and they 
were well-equipped for it -- the guy that did the trapping, he 
didn't bother gettin equipped like that, because everything was 
expense. 
IP: The seasons 
LP: The seasons fell together, see? 
LP: It was four seasons -- in other words, you had trappin 
season, then you had maybe a little bit of crab season, but not 
much. 
If you had to do crabbin in the winter time, you was in 
trouble, cause that's when the crabs don't bite that much anyway. 
And then you had a little crabbin season, we used to fish with 
what we called " caler" (?) which is nets. Now if you had to go 
into the line business then again you would have problems, 
because you'd never have enough money to survive, really.

TEXT: 
MH: So after the crabbing, then you had shrimping? 
IP: Between crabbing you had fishing, and then from fishing, 
you went to trawling, and then from trawling, or shrimpin, then 
you went back to your trappin. But if you did real well during 
trapping season, then you could skip crabbing season, then you 
could do trawling, and you didn't do too much fishing. 
MH: When 
would you maintain your equipment? 
IP: Well, first thing you had to do, you took your traps up. 
You bought traps every second year, but the first year you would 
take these traps -- you'd take this tallow and you'd take a big 
washtub and you'd boil this tallow in water and you'd dip your 
traps in it. 
That would keep ern from one year to the other. And 
then, what you'd do, you'd put ern in dozens, and you'd hang em on 
the wall. You'd hang em in the shed. 
If you never had room for 
that, then you'd drop ern in water. 
In fact I've got a hundred 
traps in water now. See, we use ern for two years and then the 
spring gets weak on it, and 
MH: Doesn't it get rusty in the water? 
IP: You've already got tallow in that water, and it would 
hold em without gettin rusty, so it makes it easier to keep --
and the following season when it was time for trappin again, you 
had to take these things and you'd scrub ern with the scrubbing 
brush, and get all the tallow out of it -- try to get all the 
smell of the barrel out, cause, believe it or not, 
it would take 
you about two weeks to get these traps to where they could catch 
rats unless you scrubbed them and let them lay in the marsh, 
because the smell of the barrel would keep the rats away from the 
traps. 
Trappin was, 
like  I'm tel l 
in you, our main season down here. 
For us.anyway. Huntin, by the time I got, I started foolin with 
decoys when I was a kid, 
but what really started me off was the 
idea -- my dad and them used to hunt for a livin and then would 
turn around and he'd raise these English callers -- I don't know 
if you've ever seen an English caller -- it's just a duck, a 
little smaller th an a French duck -- and they love to call. They 
used to raise these to hunt with -- at one time it was legal to 
use them ar decays. 
MH: What are they again? 
IP: English callers. It's a make of a duck. 
It's a French 
duck that's about 12 inches instead of bein a fourteen, fifteen 
inch duck, it'd be just ._ about 12 inches. And they get to the 
point where they love to hunt, they're just like dogs, you take 
LFPAMHOO6 
m out ': there 
MH: Do you have one? 
IPa No, I don't have any -- we had thirty some or more --
when I was a kid, that was my job, to take care of em. But he'd 
guide these people on Saturdays and Sundays. But my job was to 
make sure these ducks were fed , plus whatever other jobs I had. 
So, take care of these ducks , and it's nice because when it comes 
trainin time, just like you'd train a retriever, that's the way 
you'd train these English callers. You'd take the male, and the 
female out huntin, cause they always pair off. You'd take the 
male and the female out early in the season, and they'd take the 
male and keep im in a pi rogue, in a little box, and you'd take 
the female and you'd put her out and you'd make a little 
Platform. You'd sit her on top of that and you'd tie her so she 
can't leave, and she'd be sittin right on top of the water. And 
then, every time a duck' d go by, you'd hit the box on the male, 
and the male'd squawk and the female'd answer. And naturally, 
that brought the ducks in. Well you did that about two or three 
times, after that you didn't have to bring the male no more, 
cause she got the hang of it. And they wanted to go huntin as bad 
as the huntin dogs. 
It was nice, because you went out there with 
a flashlight in the middle of the night, and a box, and the 
female'd be comin. Wherever they was at, the female'd break for a 
run, they wanted to go huntin. They 'd come straight and get in 
the box and start callin right then. They'd be callin in the 
middle of the night. 
MH: Is that where the expression stool pigeon comes from? 
IP: Well, that's a `Judas Duck, they use to call them. They 
used to call the se Judas ducks, because what they were doin, they 
were cheatin on their own type, you know. They were double-
crossin their own ducks. They went a cycle of that, and then, 
naturally, they outlawed this. 
MH: Did the ducks get smart to that? 
IP: That's against the law completely. You can't do that 
anymore. 
MH: Are ducks getting smarter? 
IP: Ducks are smart now. Ducks are smart to the point where 
-- that's the only way they can survive -- they'll stick to the 
open waters at daytime and come in and feed at night, you see. 
When the hunters aren't botherin' em. 
MH: By the time they get down here, they've probably alrea 
been shot at 
IP: Ooh -- they're just as smart as they can be. They are 
smart. By the time they hit here, they're real smart. 
MH: Do you think that has something to do with it? 
at. 
IP: Oh, of cou rse -- every state they hit they're bein shot 
MH: So you got the toughest job on the whole coast. 
IP: When.you try to lure those, you better not be off much 
I'll tell you. They're lookin for the environment 
well hidden if , 
you gotta be 
you're gonna call them you better know what 
you're doin. You try to call em when they can't hear you too 
good. What you do is, 
if you call a duck, you call em, the wind's 
blowin from your back most of the t 
if you don't watch it 
ime, and they'll sme ll ya too;

V  
MU a I didn't know ducks could smell. 
IP: Certain varieties of ducks -- your teal, your widgeons, 
your gray„ ducks, they' 11, smel-1 you. So what you got to do, you 
gotta blind so that the wind doesn't travel over open waters, 
what we call (?) where you got the wind on your left shoulder=, or 
your right shoulder. Cause if the duck makes that turn, 
it's gust 
like somebody shot at him. He'll flare up if he can get a whiff 
of you. So actually, what you're tryin to do is, 
in order to fool 
im, 
you got the blind to where he don't see ya, he don't smell 
ya. You put your decoys out -- there's certain ways of puttin em 
out -- you put em out too far, they'll get to recognize em before 
they -- that's why we use mostly teals to hunt, because the 
bigger the duck, the bigger your decoy, the further they'll 
recognize them. So we cut down on what theyicall -- we use teals 
and we don't use anything that's too bright: By the time they 
recognize em, they're right next to the gun. They're under the 
gun already. So, yes, by the time we get the ducks, they're 
pretty smart. They light in the middle on you -- of course some 
of em'll make a mistake, naturally, but it's not easy to get the 
limit by the time they get here. See, right now, on our land they 
probably got a coupla thousand ducks, but you're not gonna get 
the limit that easily, unless the wind's blowin and the 
conditions are right. 
My grandsons don't trap, 
I'll take Mike hunting now and 
then, but he's going to be a doctor. 
MH: No one would ever trap for sport would they? 
IP: No -- the last few years I trapped I used to look at it 
not necessarily cause I needed the dollar, but because of the 
health end of it. 
Just like you go somewhere, and you jog -- in 
other words, why jog if you can go trappin? If you made a few 
extra dollars, why complain. She used to complain -- " If somethin 
happens to you out there, there's nobody around you." She wanted 
to buy me a walkie-talkie. I'd be the only guy out there walking 
around with an antenna. 
MH: Do you have songs about trapping? 
(There's one in the film Andy Kulker made, called 
"Mosquitoes and High Water") 
IP: See it's the trapper that has another problem if we 
have a bad winter with no cold weather, and high tide, and plent 
mosquitos. You don't catch nothin. Warm weather, high tide and 
mosquitos go together. So that's what the song was made about, 
"Mosqui y ello alta" ( sp. ?) My uncle was the one composed that 
song. " 
0 . 
(Andy Kulker and Luis Al varez were there doing the film, and 
Nick and Paige used to come aroundi learning decimas) 
Yeah, 
it used to be a good life. 
LP: We kind of get the blues when we see this kind of 
weather 
IP: Trapping weather 
MH: Are there any smells that remind you of trapping? 
IP: Yeah. We used to burn the marshes, you see, 
in the 
beginning of the winter 
LPs You'd come here and you'd see the marshland burning 
IP: So you could trap. In order to trap, 
it would be 
practically impossible to run three or four hundred traps with

the grasses .too high,  
-
M. 
g , you'd have to fight through a1'•.• this, to 
look for holes. The rats have a tendency of hidin em anyway. So 
what you do is you set fire and it goes through the marshes, but 
it won't burn the rats, 
it might burn a few dead rats from last 
year. 
If a rat nest is in good condition, it won't burn, because 
tte rats already ate all the way around it. They used this to 
build a nest. Just like if you used a sickle, they cut the grass 
and they mixed it with mud and they build a nest. Some nest's ° 11 
be built five feet high, well, you see a nest like that, all the 
way around the grass is cut. But as soon as you set fire to it, 
the rats'll hit the holes. No danger of burning those. 
LP: You burn in October 
IP: but you burn early, right. You try to burn early before 
they start breedin, give em a chance to rebuild their nests, see. 
Then if you got it burnt, very seldom will it burn level. You got 
a patch of grass here, another patch over there, and then it 
starts comin back green. Well, they go crazy over that, it's a 
feedin grass. It's a tender grass and everything else, and then 
when you put your traps out it makes it easy. 
MH: It's almost like a farm. 
IP: You cultivate it. You see, that's one reason, again, I 
say that -- see, one time we used to get a lot of geese --
geese'll plow land just like a tractor, or hogs -- they'll just 
turn it over. Maybe three or four hundred geese'll get in a given 
area and they'll work, they'll keep turning it. 
They'll eat the 
three-cornered grass, 
but in other words, they're cultivating 
this property. And the following year the grass grows green again 
because they'll cultivate and fertilize at the same time. So this 
in turn'll make your grass grow green the following year, but 
when the geese quit comin down here we started losin the land. 
That's somethin else that hurt us. 
MH: Why did the geese quit coming? 
IP: Well, various reasons. See, when we lived down on the 
island, you have three or four thousand geese just --
LP: They're short stoppin em somewhere up the line 
IP: They started feedin em -- and they don't come this far 
anymore. 
state 
LP: It's illegal to  feed, but they got someplaces in some 
IP: Well, you got reservations, and they'll feed ern, 
and 
they'll keep these -- I believe Arkansas has one of em. 
LP: It's what they call a flyway, 
isn't it? 
IP: Well, the flyway is the same path they follow every 
year. But they got given areas that they use steam through the 
pipes, they keep it-open, and they feed em corn to stay there. 
Well after you've fed em for a period of time, ,they already 
changed their habits .
:,
 -- they know no other way of survivin but to 
go to that given area. So they lost the desire or the reason for 
comin down here. You have very few geese. 
But the geese is one, he's the primary one that cultivates 
the land, cause we have no hogs in this area here. And als^

LP: I used to go out trappin --
IP: And trappin, too --
LP: I'd walk a -- certain distance and if I'd get tired I could 
lie across a 
IP: A rat hill 
r 
LP: a rat bed 
IP: and sleep there till I got back 
LP: I'd sleep right on that rat nest -- I'd put my back to 
the sun, 
let the sun hit my back, 
it felt so good. 
IP: I'd be runnin my traps and, at first she'd start with a 
lot of enthusiasm -- she'd say, " They got one, they got one here 
-- this trap's got a rat!" She'd go on to the next one " That one 
over there's got a rat! That one don't have one! That one's got 
one!" Till finally she'd wear out, she says, " Well, 
look, 
I' m 
gonna sit down on this rat nest and I'll wait for you. When you 
complete your circle, 
let me know and I'll walk back with you.
,, 
I'd look back, 
I'd be maybe from here to those trees over there, 
I'd look back, and she'd be sound asleep. I said, " Well that's 
nice. " 
LP: My daughter would say, " Rut Morn, 
aren't you afraid of 
snakes?" 
IP: They had no snakes. Very seldom will you see a bad snake 
in the salt water. 
LP: You might find a little green snake --
IP: If you get close to a woods -- They tell me Tiger Ridge 
and those places back of Point A La Hache, they had a lot of 
snakes -- but where we trapped there, well, you burned to begin 
with -- it gets rid of whatever poisonous snakes you had. Now 
water snakes'll go down too, but like your.moccasins, your 
rattlesnakes, or what have you, you'll get rid of that too. 
In 
the wintertime they have a tendency to hibernate anyway. 
In some 
areas like Tiger Ridge, -- I never trapped there though-- they 
tell me that if you had a hot spell, about a week, three or four 
days you couldn't even run your traps, they had so many cotton 
mouths and rattlers. 
Well this year the storm brought a lot of snakes into the 
island -- we went and cleaned Rudy's -- we killed five out of one 
house 
LP: rattlesnakes. I don't know where those snakes could have 
come from --
IP: The snakes came from the woods. See it's two years we 
haven't burned. 
y 
LP: We found a piece of cypress after the hurricane 
there's no.known cypress nowhere around there 
and we went out 
fishin one day and there was this big beautiful piece of cypress 
there's no cypress to be found down there. 
IP: In fact I got it in the shed now. 
I'll use- it eventually 
to make a decoy 
(talk about Gerry Parson's upcoming visit and their time at 
the Smithsonian Festival last summer) 
4P: You should have been down here for that big orange 
festival they had down there two weeks ago 
IP: We went and stayed overnight with friends 
LP: It was at Fort Jackson. The interesting part, you would 
5 
i 
LFPAMH006 
have seen a fort where the soldiers were all staying -- they wer 
fighting the English. This fort amazed me -- the way it was bui 
and everything else, and all the displays was in the fart. 
IP: We went over there to display decoys. We weren't, 
prepared for no contest, and we come in second, without even 
tryin. We didn 't bring any flyin ducks, or anything else. We just 
brought a display 
LP: They were just judgin on displays 
(discussion of the orange festival) 
They went fishing the other day and caught 67 fish, and gave 
away to friends , grandchildren . They have sometimes had as 
as 47 people eating in their home on a Sunday afternoon. 
IP: I used to work at night, and come home and sleep til 
10:30, 
11:00 and then go
-- out and run traps til dark. Trawling, 
the same way 
we'd go trawling, we'd catch five, six hampers of 
shrimp, maybe 3 or 4 hundred pounds of shrimp, we'd sell them, 
and rest a little while, then go to work. So actually I've held 
two jobs all my life. She loves to trawl, I love to trap. I love 
to hunt, but huntin doesn't have the same pull that it had on me 
one time. I like to see the grandkids -- little Scotty there, he 
loves to hunt. He loves to kill -- the other day we went and we 
killed only one -- but he enjoyed that. Course I could caught the 
limit many times if I'da done the shootin, but lettin him shoot 
and tryin to correct him and don't take any extra chances --
like I told him, I said, " There's nothin out here you have to 
kill." 
MH: How old were you when you got your first duck? 
IP: About eight, I guess. 
MH: And did your father take you out? 
IP: when I first started huntin, when , I first started gain 
out with ern, 
they used to take me, and I must have been about 
four ' or five years o ld, Grandpa said I'd bother em so much, that 
N 
they 'd take me. Of cour se , th ey p icked a day when it wasn't too 
cold. But th e y wou ld n 't let me shoot. I just had to watch. Then 
later on when they bought me an Ivan Johnson when a 
about ten 
I guess, then th e y le t me shoot. But the old man 
about four, 
five, ten decoys, maybe sixt 
Put me out, put 
like it. 
And he 
y, goin wherever he felt 
put me out without a pirogue, see. He let me make 
a blind and stay there till he come back. Most of the times he 
was guidin, he wa s takin other people out, for pay, 
na tura ll y, 
y • 
and I was just a burden to h 
i 
rn 
in a sense, I guess, so he' d put 
me out at a point and he'd leave me. 
I always killed my share. 
Even with a single shot I'd kill seven, eight, ten ducks. And I 
got to be a pretty good shot. I don't want to brag, but one time, 
I coul d hold my own w ith just a bout everybody. •,Course, ,'
now it 
doesn t make a difference. 
MH: Could you practice on anything besides ducks? 
IP: You could practice on anything. We used CO practice on 
blackbirds, with a . B2 rifle. They used to cross by the thousands 
in the afternoons, we'd buy maybe a couple of boxes of . BE slugs, 
and sit on the edge of the canal and shoot at em . You'd get 
pretty good, but you ain't gonna hit too many with a rifle, but 
it gets to where you're hittin close, and you're kiilin some, 
if 
you're shootin with a shot gun you ain't gonna miss. And, your 
reflexes, naturally when you're young your reflexes are better --

you know."-
He doesn't hunt squirrels. Rabbits, maybe if he wants to 'eat 
one. Never got into hunting dogs, tried to train a retriever 
once, for two weeks, but he had to fight with it so much that his 
father made him get rid of it. 
More discussion of the old days, the authority of old 
people, the law maintained by people themselves. Courtship and 
travel over the bad roads when cars first came around. More on 
respect for the elders in the old days. He is 62 himself. 
IP: A lot of times we talk about the old people, but we're 
getting older now. 
They are curious about my impressions of their part of the 
country, and I tell them I'm amazed and excited to be there.

MH: Do you like that miniature trapper's camp? 
IP: It's pretty close to it. 
It was thought up with a lot of 
thinkin. 
MH: Would you change or add anything? 
r: 
IP: Well, they 've got about everything you could add. Maybe 
I'd put a few flying birds over it -- to add a little more to it. 
I'd put a couple of seagulls and ducks to it. Maybe a crane or a 
few birds . They' ve got a pirogue on it -- they've even got decoys 
on it, and then they got the rats on the wharf, then you've got 
your wringer, and they got the rats on the hangers, and they got 
one of ern skinning rats. I think they got an old washing machine 
on the porch. They should have a washtub with a wash board if it 
would be in olden times. 
MHz The clothes hangin on the line like they're blowin in 
the wind 
IP: Bluejeans, shirt, hat -- I wore a cap with a button on 
it, 
all my life. 
Discussion of the grass huts, the palmetto shacks , and what 
they tell the kids about in the museum; the pirogue making. 
IP: You see, the structure of a fish itself, 
if you ever 
looked at the structure of a fish -- you take a catfish, for 
instance, 
it's got the cross, Jesus on the cross, you can see 
where the hands are. And you got the crab that's got the picture 
of a lady. You didn't know that? Right in the shell, 
if you look 
at it, 
it's the face and the bust of a lady. 
MH: On the inside or the outside? 
IP: Outside --
MH: What else is like that? 
IP: The gallfish has a sword, 
like -- and there's quite a 
few. Offhand I can't remember all of them. 
I get ready to leave. He offers to take me out in a boat 
the next time I go there. 
Talking about seeing an alligator -- drifting around in the 
water, watching them. Six or seven feet long. 
IP: We had an experience with one quite a few years back. We 
had that 26- foot Lafitte skiff, which I finally sold, 
but anyh ow 
I had to have it -- I was going out and scraping it before we 
pick it up so we 'd have it ready for copper paint ina. 
I'd get in 
the water -- water up to your waist and shoulders, and I'd scrape 
the bottom of it, 
to get all the barnacles and things off of it. 
We'd pick it up once a year, clean it up, 
paint it, do whatever 
you gotta do with it s and throw it back. But anyway, she was 
sittin on the deck -- I took it across the canal in one of them 
dead -end canals we got, and she was sittin on deck and she was 
watchin. And we was talkie and I was scrapin. And I scraped one 
side and I had four feet to go to finish, she says, " You know, 
it's funny , I see a log over there sometimes I see it all, 
sometimes I see the end of it, 
the top of it --" I said, " Yeah? 
Where it's at?" She says, " Over there ." I said, "Yeah , that's a 
log alright, that's an alligator. It's a pretty g ood sued 
one, • vu .++ 
A' 
said, " Well, yo u kee p an eye on it ." Cause I knew he 
smelled these barnacles -- I'm scrapin these barnacles, and he 
could smell them , you know. And they'll eat barnacles. I said, 
Well , look, you keep an eye on him, and if he goes under, you 
8 
LFRAMHOO6 
let me know, cause I'm gonnaAin' t`

get out of here.  
no`sense in 
tangling with an alli gator unless you got to. So, sure enough, 
there was about a coupl e o f feet to go, and she said, " He went 
under." So I jumped on the boat and he passed right under me -
shhhhhhew! He disappeared and we didn't see it no more. 
(laughing) Course I didn't go back and finish scrapin the boat. I 
was just about finished. But they don't bother you. Maybe one out 
of a dozen will bother you, 
but I didn't want that one to be that 
one, because if an alligator grabs you. 
Remember Ducky? Poor fellow, he's gone now too. We used to 
live down in Delacroix (?) and it rained and the ditches got 
full. Well, way in the back, that's when the geese used to come 
there 
lot, they had two ponds they used to hunt now and then, 
and they had alligators in them. I knew they had alligators in 
them, and every so often after a heavy rain, young ones would 
come out, and this was about two and a half, three feet long. And 
he come out in the yard, so one of my cousins -- they were two 
twins -- they come rennin over -- " Uncle (?) they got an 
alligator in the yard." Their daddy said, " Get away, you seen a 
lizard." I said, " Come on, you didn't see no alligator." They 
said, " Yeah, we got an alligator in th e front yard. " I said, 
"Well let s go see. 
So we went, and sure enough, they had an 
alligator in the front yard. So I said, " Look, do what I tell 
You. Go back, get yourself a piece of twine, and a little can, 
and we'll catch him." Cause there was a fellow had an alligator 
farm, he was raisin alligators. Joe Czerny (?) So here comes the 
paperboy. Ducky, he was an overgrown kid, that's- all he was. He 
come there with shoes on and no socks, pants rolled up, he says 
"Whatcha all lookin at?" I said, " We got an alligator here, we're 
waitin for one of the twins to bring a piece of twine or somethin 
so we can catch im. " " Sure, 
I' l 
l catch him!" I said, " Ducky, you 
better leave that alligator alone." He said, " No!" he said, " I'm 
gonna step on his head," he said, " And I'll grab him." I said, 
"you do what you want, but be careful." So, 
boy, he stepped on 
that alligator and that alligator twisted, and turned around and 
grabbed and took his shoe clean off him. Didn't hurt him, 
but if 
he had grabbed him by the ankle he probably would have held him. 
I said, " Ducky! You gonna catch him?" He says, " N000! I ain't 
getting back in that water!" ( laughing) So we caught him and tied 
him up, 
and brought him down the road.
