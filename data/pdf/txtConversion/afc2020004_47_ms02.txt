START OF RECORDING 
 
Tiffany Midge:  This is Tiffany Midge coming to you from my home office in Moscow, Idaho. 
 
[Tiffany Midge reads “Antiquing with Indians”] 
 
TM:  I chose "Antiquing with Indians" because it touches upon aspects of place and 
displacement and also visibility, persistence, resistance and acknowledgment. “Antiquing with 
Indians” is a favorite poem of mine for its ironical humor and its response to mid-twentieth 
century kitsch with regards to race and ethnic commodification and the appropriation of Native 
American culture in particular. With the recent retirement of the Land O’Lakes butter maiden 
and Aunt Jemima syrup, and Uncle Ben's rice logos—also sports mascots and merchandising—
this poem seems especially timely and appropriate. Thank you for inviting me to be a part of 
this project.
