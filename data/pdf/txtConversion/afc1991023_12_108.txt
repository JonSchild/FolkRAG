(engine noise) 
The family has been here G—Chatsworth; 27GT 
about 15 years. 
Both houses were here, but only part of what 
ours 
is now was here then. 
They added on. 
Henry does his own 
work. 
Christine places wind screen on mike, but there is a loud 
hissing or wind noise.) 
He did the rock work--wind can't get 
through it. 
He's doing it on our house at night now. 
He's not 
finished yet. 
My husband Harvey (Henry's son) works on 
it with 
him. 
He (who?) raises the garden--likes raspberries. 
They get 
the rocks for the house from where my husband works. 
At the top 
he tries to end 
it off with a brick. 
(Traffic noise) 
We have 
some daffodils. 
The couple of cold nights got rid of some of our 
flowers. 
I don't like moving. 
This shed here was supposed to be a 
dollhouse, but it's full of junk and parts. 
The only animals we 
have are rabbits and a dog. 
We sell rabbits--lots of people 
around here like to eat them. 
The hutch 
is about two by three 
feet. 
We take the pregnant females out so the males won't kill 
the babies. 
The only female that had a litter got away and dug a 
hole here 
in the yard. 
Harvey feeds them at night, and 1 feed 
them during the day. 
You have to keep them off the ground so 
Cartwright--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 1 
worms don't get in them. 
We've lost one that way. 
120 
We sell them to pet dealers. 
When people buy them for meat, 
they just stop by and buy one. 
That's our cat--she's a stray. 
I like to take in strays, 
and 
if anyone asks for it 
I'll 
give it to them. 
I have a Persian 
in the house that I saw someone actually dump out of a car. 
Then 
they get hit. 
Dumped dogs end up going after chickens and the 
rabbits--we have to shoot them. 
A wild dog can destroy a mess of 
rabbits in one night. 
They don't kill to eat--just to kill. 
That's another reason why we got the pen pretty high. 
Kittens 
and puppies get hit before you can find them. 
That boat over there 
is Harvey's. 
He goes fishing now and 
then down around New Gretna. 
He catches perch and catfish. 
We 
don't like to eat catfish--they're too hard to clean--you have to 
skin them. 
Harvey found that doll house. 
200 
That shed 
is made of cedar or maybe pine. 
You can't really 
tell. 
It's really sturdy. 
Here's a big walking stick (insect). 
They get big around here. 
Here's what used to be a hothouse. 
We turned it 
into a 
woodshed. 
They grew flowers and vegetables in 
it. 
A hothouse is 
mainly for the winter. 
(Child and traffic noise. 
Tape off for a 
few seconds.) 
There's no name for this boat except 16—foot or 14—foot. 
It's fiberglass. 
(Discussion with Carl Fleischhauer about 
picture—taking.) 
This is a peach tree. 
We bought it from a 
local place. 
It takes them a long time to grow. 
I hope it bears 
fruit--some over there don't. 
This 
is the truck Harvey uses to collect things 
in the 
woods. 
People dump junk 
in the woods. 
They shouldn't do 
it, but 
they do. 
Harvey's working on the back part of the body of the 
truck--putting in a new floor. 
300 
You can sell everything out of this junk. 
"You get the 
motors out, strip them down, and then, uh, take the outside part, 
the metal and stuff, and they 'II 
crush it." 
It's night work--
they do 
it after work. 
That building is their workshop. 
They 
tear the motors apart--use a table. 
That yellow truck belongs to 
the company Harvey works for. 
He keeps it here so people don't 
get it (vandalize). 
Old vegetable sign. 
Drums from washers and 
dryers. 
Old mixer (cement). 
This straw here 
is cattail trimmings. 
A guy named 
Richardson (?) buys the cattails from them (the family). 
He 
comes around and picks them up. 
Last year they went for $9.00 a 
Cartwright--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 2 
thousand (items). 
You can cut between 10,000 and 20,000 per day. 
420 
The name on the truck is the name of the guy Harvey bought 
the truck from. 
He used 
it for collecting junk, too. 
He also 
had blueberries and stuff. 
He was getting old, so sold the 
truck. 
(Discussion of fleas on animals.) 
We got the rabbits 
mainly for our oldest daughter. 
We don't tell her when people 
buy them for meat. 
END OF SIDE ONE 
SIDE TWO 
000 
(Picture—taking by Carl) 
Discussion of the cement mixer 
mentioned on side one. 
Martins and swallows nest in that bird house. 
They were 
there this year (some question of the bird house being empty 
now). "Harvey's mom's gotten to where she likes lots of flowers, 
which is good. 
It makes a good appearance to the house." 
Christine asks 
if that lawnmower is the one Harvey got hurt 
on when he was a kid--reference to a story heard earlier, not on 
this tape. 
(Tape skips a few times.) 
Henry's had this garden 
since 
it got warm enough. 
This is September--he started it 
in 
March or April. 
I was still carrying the baby when he started 
it. 
Harvey plans to sell some vegetables for extra income when 
he retires. (static on tape.) 
He used chicken manure, and his 
garden did better than mine. 
This ground needs a rich 
fertilizer. 
Horse manure 
is just as good, though. 
He doesn't 
compost. 
They turned the hothouse into a woodshed about 4 or 5 years 
ago. 
they needed to keep the wood dryer. 
Maybe they didn't have 
the time to put up another shed. 
Mrs. Webb just did the flowers 
this year for the first time. 
Most of them are annuals. 
I like 
flowers, but they're hard to keep going. 
As soon as they get the 
brick work done, I'm going to get some climbing flowers. 
I had 
some purple and red ones last year that I liked. 
She has some 
over here. 
100 
(Discussion of the chickens.) 
That chicken is molting. 
The 
brown ones are a mixture--red. 
The speckled ones are Dominic, 
and the white ones are leghorn. 
The black ones are the mixed 
breed. 
"Tina, quit feeding the grapes to the chickens." 
(Later, 
a child's voice says, "Would anyone care for a grape?") 
"Oh, 
it's Jeremy throwin' them in. 
Jeremy, your papa's gonna beat 
your behind!" 
"I'm just throwin' 
in the peelin's." 
The 
grapevines were here before the chickens were. 
We use them for 
jelly. 
They're supposed to turn purple, but they may not this 
year. 
They're not fully ripe. 
Usually someone will come along 
and ask for the grapes to make jelly. 
(Implying that the Webbs 
don't get any.) 
(Interchange with Jeremy about eating green 
grapes.) 
The zinnias are just for decoration--sometimes she cuts 
some and takes them inside. 
(Tomatoes, beans, cucumber.) 
He's 
got stuff growing here that I never knew could grow around here. 
(Cabbage. 
Lima beans.) 
Cartwright--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 3 
200 
(Potatoes.) 
Two rows of potatoes. 
These are sweet 
potatoes. 
They grow on a long vine, and 
it will go into the 
ground and root and make a potato. 
(Harvey arrives, they greet 
him.) 
(Blip 
in tape--maybe turned off briefly.) (Harvey 
describes his junk and some of the operations he will perform on 
it.) 
Harvey: 
I tear my junk apart. 
I don't sell 
it whole no 
more. 
I get more money for it that way. This was a stove. 
What's in the bucket over there, I dump that in there, and 
it 
gives me more weight. 
That handle goes for a different kind of 
metal. 
The smaller stuff, I can just fit right down 
in there. 
I 
gotta take this all 
the way to Camden. 
I collect aluminum 
cans,too. 
You get paid by the pound for all 
this stuff. 
I even 
started collecting newspapers and glass bottles, too. 
(Tape 
off.)

Jeremy telling Christine about the beehive. 
Blend of 
honeybees and warrior bees. 
The queen bee has to be out of the 
nest so the honeybees can do their work. 
When the queen is out 
of the nest, then the honeybees go out of the nest. 
It depends 
on which 
is the boss. 
I'll show you where we butcher the chickens. 
(Jeremy 
continued.) 
We take chicken poop and my grandfather uses a big 
shovel to put it 
in the wheelbarrow (for manure on the garden.) 
See these ropes, we keep them up 
in the tree, and when he 
(Henry) wants to hang the chickens, he makes a big loop and then 
he waits until they get tired enough and he holds their heads and 
takes a very sharp knife. 
He stabs it right here 
in the side of 
the shed so it will 
be safe. 
Then he picks out a chicken and 
hangs them up (by one foot) and pulls out the knife, and cuts off 
the head. 
This is regular rope (maybe nylon?) which hangs from a 
sapling to about Henry's shoulder height. 
400 
(Jeremy continued) 
See how those tomatoes are rotting? 
That's cause of the acid 
in the sand. 
The One up above puts the 
acid 
in there. 
All that sand 
is acid. 
Would you care for a 
grape? 
(Concord grapes) 
You suck the inside out and throw the 
outside to the chickens. 
(Christine encourages him not to pick 
more grapes.) 
Here's the shovel for the chicken manure. 
When 
you're ready, you can come back over here and I'll pick some 
grapes and you can take them home in this can. 
(Christine 
discourages him.) 
Dee Dee and Harvey talk about the beehive again. 
Henry got 
stung just once. 
It took three or four guys to put the hive 
in 
my pickup. 
We took a feed bag and put a piece of string around 
one end, and put a string around the other end during cold 
weather, so the bees didn't move much, and put it 
in my truck.

Harvey: 
People shouldn't throw stuff away 
in the woods. 
G—Chatsworth; 27GT wouldn't be so bad 
if 
it was just washers and 
dryers, and I came along and picked them up, but they dump bags 
of trash and stuff. 
See this, this 
is a piece of aluminum wire, 
but it has a piece of metal wire with it. 
You have to uncoil the 
whole thing to get the aluminum wire out. 
Here's the ground 
wire. 
This metal 
is $.32 per pound. 
Aluminum cans are worth a 
penny apiece. 
See this bottle, I have to take the paper labels 
off, and I break the glass. 
I keep the colors of glass 
separated: 
green, brown, white. 
I sell 
it to whoever buys 
it. 
I'd try at Berlin first. 
I got into this business through my 
dad. 
Here's a duck pen. 
We had them for pets. 
Dee Dee loves 
animals. 
I ain't got enough time for that. 
Now my work hours 
just give me enough time to work 
in the yard a little while it's 
light. 
I need to work 
in my yard. 
You can see that. 
I like to 
have as much as I can stack on my truck. 
This is cast iron. 
I 
even save inner tubes--they pay about two cents a pound. 
(He 
shows her several pieces of junk and describes how he would 
process them so he could get more onto his truck.) 
100 
I couldn't do this kind of work in the city. 
I would miss 
it. 
It's like a hobby for me--I 
love doing it. 
It's gettin' so 
Cartwright--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 5 
rough anymore, that sometimes you feel 
like packin' up and 
leaving and forgettin' about all 
this kind of stuff 'cause 
there's so many bills and taxes around here. 
I pay taxes to 
live 
in this house. 
I guess they're going up because there are so 
many new people moving in. 
They're trying to keep people from 
moving in. 
Here's a leaf grinder. 
My brother—in—law didn't 
finish putting siding on the house, so I had to finish it. 
That 
was the first time I ever did 
it. 
Here are some of the rocks I 
use on the house. 
(He talks about getting the rocks and hoisting 
them up to put into the wall.) 
See my property line there? 
That's the first time you'll ever see grass there. 
I planted it 
because I love grass in a yard. 
When my dad and I get the rock 
work done on the house, I'll cut down this little area and put in 
some topsoil for my 
lawn. 
Then I'll make a flower bed along this 
wall. 
I'll probably put a flower box up here on the front of the 
house with a pole. 
The old siding will come off, and I'll 
put 
red bricks up here. 
You can't do anything with concrete when the 
weather's cold. 
200 
Here's a pear tree. 
(Tape off and on again. 
Sounds like indoors now. 
Harvey is 
talking about copper wire in storage for electrical work.) 
I 
save bolts and nuts there. 
This was a cow pen, and it was 
partitioned off, but we took the partition out. 
We made the 
garage bigger. 
I shingled the roof with shingles from my brother 
who's a carpenter. 
I had some other shingles that weren't the 
same, but who cares, as 
long as it don't leak. 
The cedar boards 
came from my brother for fireplace wood. 
I burned the badder 
stuff, and I used the gooder stuff to box this in so 
it wouldn't 
be so cold. 
I don't think the cedar came from around here. 
The 
sawmill was at Manahawkin. 
It's pretty rough—cut cedar. 
I have 
a pile of cedar slabs and two—by—fours stacked back there 
in the 
woods. 
There's a dump 
in Chatsworth. 
They used to bury 
it, but now 
they're getting so strict about it. 
They're putting it 
in 
dumpsters (pronounced "dumpters) and they're trucking it out. 
It's like a big truck body. 
300 
(Christine asks how he decides where he's going to go when 
looking for junk.) 
I have a friend who has a load of washers for 
me. 
He gives me junk. 
Mostly I find it when we're riding around 
on the weekend. 
And I have friends who tell me where it is. 
I 
know this area pretty well: 
Browns Mills, Pemberton, Mt. Holly, 
Moorestown, (unintelligible), Atsion Lake, Hammonton, New Gretna, 
Tuckerton, Warren Grove, out through there, Long Beach Island. 
If I had the time and the gas money saved up, 
I'd ride around 
through these housing projects where they go out and buy new 
washers, and they throw their old ones out in the street. 
But 
it's a 50-50 chance that you'd run into anything, because some 
projects, they wouldn't have anything. 
I see this stuff, but I 
won't pick anything up when I'm in the company truck. 
I know of 
several 
iceboxes and a freezer right now. 
It's always out 
in the 
Cartwright--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 6 
woods. 
Sometimes people come to a spot where stuff has been 
dumped, and a cop follows them, and they get blamed for it. 
You 
have to watch that kind of stuff. 
(He talks about an old window 
that wasn't suitable for the house that he put into the shed.) 
400 
Directions for finding things in the woods: 
if people tell 
me the exact places to turn and all, I can find 
it. 
If my boss 
told me 4 or 5 things to do, I may remember the first three, but 
might have to ask him again about the last two. 
I don't go on 
real sandy roads--I don't want to get stuck. 
461 
(Tape off 
in middle of sentence--did batteries die?) 
END OF SIDE ONE 
SIDE TWO 
(Side Two begins at about 036) 
036 
If you have dual wheels, usually you can take a log and put 
it between the duals and walk right out. 
(Is he talking about 
sand roads?) 
See this little stove--there's supposed to be a grate up 
there where you put your wood 
in, 
and the ashes are supposed to 
drop down. 
He (Henry) burns copper wire in here to burn off the 
insulation. 
It was sitting in the weather, and we thought we'd 
get some use out of 
it. 
(He points out a Volkswagon motor--a 
source of 
lighter metal 
1?1). 
100 
Here's a starter from a truck--you tear them apart like 
this. 
See all 
that copper? (static--Christine and Carl talk 
about it.) 
We put it in that stove until 
it gets cherry red, and 
the copper will come out easier. 
(He gets a sample of burnt 
wire) 
See how that's been burnt? 
That's an alternator from a 
car there. 
You don't recognize it because the housing is off of 
it. 
Or 
it could be a motor. 
I take the housing and put it with 
the heavy metal. 
See all 
those bolts 
in a pile on the floor? 
I'll 
dump those in the washers and dryers to be sold with them. 
There's nothing in there that's good. 
See all this junk on the 
table here, I'll save about half of this. 
This one has a good 
head on 
it--I'll save it. 
I won't save this screw driver head--I 
don't save that kind of thing. 
200 
I have a cassette and radio here, but the radio quit 
working. 
I put all 
new pipe 
in my house, and I saved all 
the 
old. 
I save big pieces of cardboard to 
lie on under cars when 
I'm working on them. 
(He demonstrates sorting of a few items 
into heavy metal, block, car bodies, and other categories.) 
I 
have this magnet all 
the time so I can test the metal. 
See, this 
will magnet--this won't. 
I junk car bodies. 
I take all the 
copper out of the dash. 
I take the gas tank out--they won't buy 
them. 
I strip telephone wire with a knife. 
300 
There's two types of copper--clean copper and burnt copper. 
Copper cleaned with a knife 
is brighter. 
This here is 
light 
metal because it magnets. 
Then there's aluminum--it doesn't 
Cartwright--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 7 
magnet, and it has to be clean. 
After I take the copper out of 
the dash and take off the gas tank, I have to break the glass on 
a car. 
I put oil pans and stuff like that into the car--you get 
more weight that way. 
I put stuff into the trunk, too. 
You 
can't get enough for just a car. 
Last time I went it was $1.10 
or $1.20 per hundred pounds. 
(At Joe's 
in Egg Harbor?) 
Here's a 
gear--it's heavy metal, along with housings for starters and 
alternators. 
There are two categories of heavy metal that 
determine the rate you're paid. 
400 
(Christine asks how much he gets for an average load.) 
I 
took a load to Camden, and I brought home like, $140. 
At Camden, 
they take light metal and heavy metal. 
I take copper to Red 
Lion--a place on Rt. 70. 
He also buys aluminum and brass. 
He 
crushes the aluminum. 
I've got about $1000 worth of junk here, 
but I ain't in no hurry to get rid of 
it. 
I'll 
do this 
if I ever 
get laid off.

007: Harry Dilkes Jr. describes location of two log cabins 
with a spring well, built about 40 years ago. The spring is boxed 
in about a foot, 18" square. Perhaps 200 people know of the 
location. His directions to get there: "You know where Jenkins 
is 
outside of Chatsworth? It's called Jenkins Community. Go past 
there -- you know where Harrisville is? Go over that bridge at 
Harrisville; make the first left on a dirt road. Follow that dirt 
road right on around. Keep on going, keep on going, straight 
across a little reservoir, and take the second left. Right. 
Follow it right on around, you come right to 
it. The other one, 
you go back to Harrisville, and keep on straight. Go across . . . 
Cathy, what's that lake? Where you lost your keys. Timber Lake. 
Timber Lake campground, past there make the first left." 
008: Discussion of recording and photographing problems 
between CC and SS. 
010: They have 
having learned 
Webbs when the 
been doing woods work about seventeen years, 
it from their father Harry Sr. They taught the 
Webbs moved in 
15 years ago. 
TX02: 012: Harry and Cathy were pointing out other "Pineys" for 
me to talk to, because they have been visited several times by 
reporters wanting to know how the Pineys live, and assumed that 
was what we were interested in too. I went over at their 
suggestion to talk to a woman helping to serve meal tickets to 
the guests. She sat down to eat and talked a little about her 
mother, Mrs. Cramer of Pemberton, who 
is a member of Tru—Blu 
Cooperative and runs her blueberry farm since her husband died; 
she 
is 79. This woman got involved with the pig roast through 
being a member of the Ladies' Auxiliary of the VFW. 
CC: 
IS it mostly veterans and their families that belong to 
the VFW? 
Informant: Only veterans and their families. 
CC: So it's kind of a closed club then, huh? 
Cartwright--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 10 
Informant: Yeah, really. But if we have an affair, we sell 
tickets to outsiders . . . to my friends . . . in the Moose Lodge 
Ladies' Auxiliary. 
CC: What kinds of activities do they have here? You say you 
tend bar a couple of nights a week, so they'd be open then . . . 
Informant: 
. We have beef and beer nights, . 
CC: Are they raising money for something special? I'm sorry, 
I'm keeping you from eating. 
Informant: Well, just to keep things going, really, you know 
you always need extra money. 
At this point she wanted to get on with her dinner, so I 
backed off. Cathy was kind and articulate and seemed to know 
right away what we would be 
interested in -- she only told me 
later about all 
the reporters. I returned to her. G—Browns Mills; 
21GT 
TX03: 015: Clamming techniques G—Chatsworth; 27GT: Henry 
Jr. 
Catches two varieties: white clams are 100 for $10. You search 
around with your toes on the seabed, reach down with your hand 
and grab it, 
put it 
in your basket. You get an inner tube and set 
a bushel basket in 
it to hold the clams. 
018: Cranberrying (inaudible). They go from one field to 
another, working at Haines's, DeMarco's, and other places. 
019: Cathy: I could pretty well make it on my own (making a 
living at woods work) 
if I had to. My first and my best . . . 
would be the cattails. . . . As far as I'm concerned, 
it's the 
easiest job for a girl, or a guy. And it's the fastest money: you 
can't get better money than working in the woods. I mean, you 
could work on any other job you want to, 
as a secretary or 
whatever, you could make better money working in the woods. 
. 
Between me and him [Harry], I'd say 
it must be about . . . a 
thousand a week, I would average. It's not skill; 
it depends on 
what you do and how much you can do. 
020: Harry: Now pine cones G—Chatsworth; 27GT, you carry a 
cover on your back. And you get to a tree, pick all the 
pinecones, you fill them up with your right hand, you throw them 
on the truck. And when you fill the cover up, you've got a 
thousand. 
021: Cathy: I did just as good as him, me being a girl, him 
being a guy, . . . and I held a bucket in front of me instead of 
throwing them in a basket on my back [demonstrates the long 
swinging throw necessary, and the bent stance of having the 
basket on one's back). . . . We was averaging forty, forty—five 
Cartwright--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 11 
dollars a day. 
021: Harry: Now Hazy made about fifty dollars a day. (Cathy: 
By himself. Hazy's a good woodsman G—Chatsworth; 27GT. He's about 
the best I've ever seen. Knocking blueberries, cattailing, 
everything, . . . when he's out to work, he's out to work: he's 
not out to play. That's the best way to be when you're out there 
to work in the woods. You're out there to work; you're not out 
there to play around. Harry: (to CC): Can you make a living off 
the woods? CC: I probably couldn't, no. Harry: Sure you could. 
Cathy: Yes, you could. Do you think you could? You'd probably do 
a lot better than you'd think you could, though. You'd probably 
make more money than at any other job. 
022: Harry: You know them toadstools? Mushroom gathering; 
G—Chatsworth; 27GT. A friend of mine gathers them, boils them, and 
he cooks them and he heats them. You can eat them, 
long as you 
boil them first. 
CC: Any kind of toadstool? 
Harry: Oh yeah. Yeah. Then he puts them in a jar, and maybe two 
days later, 
it's just like eating -- like eating mushrooms off a 
pizza. Boil them, 
let it cool, then he puts em in a jar slice em 
up, 
and ah, you add something to 
it -- vinegar or salt water, I 
can't remember what it 
is. . . . It's really good. Big Al 
Cis the 
name of the friend who does this]. It's like blueberry wine. You 
like blueberry wine G—Chatsworth; 27GT? You never had blueberry 
wine? I'll 
tell you, . . . Cathy: It's a wine you make to your 
own strength, to what you desire. It's about the best you can 
have. (general directions follow.) Hazy 
is apparently the 
winemaker for the family. Cathy says he 
is the best woodsman 
also. 
026: Cathy: Most people think with the "Piney" G—Chatsworth; 
27GT, he's the most ignorant person, and they can be, 
if they want 
to be. But they can be the most polite people 
in 
the world too. 
Yes ma'am, no ma'am. Harry: I'm sorry to be talking this way 
(e.g., a lot of off—color humor) but we've been drinking all 
night and we're having a lot of fun. CC: I understand; you don't 
mean any harm by 
it. 
END OF SIDE ONE. 
As this side of the tape opens, Cathy was continuing to tell 
me about her three children (she 
is 22; she had her first child 
when she was 17), and some of the difficult illnesses she has 
experienced: she was supposed to be unable to have children, and 
was close to death once or twice. She comes from Pennsylvania, 
and 
is not altogether sure she wants to remain with Harry: some 
recent problems have caused her some doubts. At the same time, 
Hazy, who had brought me a plate of steamed clams and venison, 
was helping himself to a clam from the plate, and Harry and he 
Cartwright--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 12 
were laughing and making jokes about his eating my clam -- which, 
like tomato and "checking your mailbox," 
is apparently rich 
in 
pornographic innuendo for them. I ignored this and continued to 
listen to Cathy. 
003: Woods work begins early in the morning, about 5 a.m., 
and continues for four or five hours or until they want to stop. 
004: Harry did the gutting of the pig being roasted outside. 
Description of the gutting process: the pig 
is dipped in boiling 
water to 
loosen the bristles. 
If the water is too hot, the 
bristles won't come and then you dip it again. If 
it's doesn't 
come then, you have to skin it. Pig roasts are "very rare around 
here." Venison dinners are more common at organizations' dinners 
like this one. 
005: The only important piece of clothing necessary for 
cattailing and pineconing or "pineballing" G—Chatsworth; 27GT is 
really old clothes. For cattails, you're barefoot anyway so shoes 
don't matter, though "you're taking a chance with snakes out 
there. You're taking a chance." 
006: Edie's husband (who was too far down the table for the 
mike to pick up, and not interested 
in taping) is a deep sea 
clammer. He works with big dredge nets on a scow boat 
G—Chatsworth; 27GT.. You have to go to your own location each time, 
located with compass and radar. This section very difficult to 
hear. 
009: Cathy gives directions for making fried tomatoes, 
dredged in flour with a little sugar and a little syrup, and 
served with sandwiches for lunch. This, 
like snapping turtle 
G—Chatsworth; 27GT was something she never ate before she came 
here. Harry offers to show me some snapper traps: there 
is a sign 
up 
in front of the family's home advertising firewood and 
snappers for sale. 
010: Researchers from Penn State have come down and asked 
Harry how you make a living off the land, but there's a lot they 
don't know. He suggests he could show me things they don't know, 
and I could write a book and make a fortune. He points out that I 
could do 
it because I have a good education: I know how to read 
and write. He and his brothers don't. 
013: CC asks what the important things are that the 
researchers don't know. Harry :L Do you believe 
in the Jersey 
Devil G—Chatsworth; 27GT? 
You ever see him? (Edie: My mom has seen him.) Can I tell 
you something? Go way, way 
in the swamp. Stay there a month. They 
say the seventh day of the month, you'll see him. He can turn 
himself into a rat, fox, squirrel, chipmunk, a human being, pig, 
cow, 
it don't matter. But you'll see him, and you'll know what he 
Cartwright--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 13 
turned into. 
CC: Do you see him turn? 
HD: Well, my mom, she told me about it, 
and ah, she heard 
bells ring, like cows' bells. All 
she seen was a snake's tongue, 
horns, and hoofs like a pig. And his tail came to a point. (Hard 
to hear) 
CC: Once it's turned, did she say how you know it's the 
Jersey Devil and not just an ordinary animal? 
HD: Well, she seen it. She looked out the window, heard the 
bells. And when she ran to the door, the dog had the bells, 
running down the road. (inaudible sentence). Chased him down the 
road a little. . . . You know where Fred Brown [of McPhee's book] 
lived down 
in Chatsworth? He died ten, twelve years ago. If you 
get a chance, 
look 
in the records. . . . He's the head guy. He's 
seen 
it, my mother's seen 
it . . . I never have. 
CC: 
Is the Jersey Devil supposed to hurt anybody? 
HD: Scares. Scares them. 
CC: Does he have a body like a human being? 
HD: Well, I'll 
tell 
you how it first started out. A lady, 
she was 
in the hospital, had a baby boy. And she named him the 
Jersey Devil.And ah, 
she had him about, six months or a year, and 
he took off, came back, (inaudible) And he's been the Jersey 
Devil ever since. He comes back every seven years. 
CC: Comes back to where -- Leeds Point (where McMahon's Pine 
Barrens Legends, Lore, and Lies 
lists his birth)? 
D: 
(possibly confused by this reference to Leeds Point): 
Well, wherever he's from: Medford, 
like some people have seen him 
in Medford, some people in Mount Laurel (outside Pinelands a few 
miles west of Vincentown); or 
in New Jersey -- it depends. If you 
stay 
in the woods for three weeks (you'll see him). . . . I can 
show you places where he's been, where he's hide out. I could not 
tell 
you what he eats, how long he goes; I could not tell you. 
Only way to find out would be an old—timer. And ask him. 
CC: Can you think of anybody? 
HD: Only one I know would be my mom. She can tell you what 
he eats, how long he goes for, and -- do you believe in ghosts? 
Have you ever seen shoes walk by theirselves? 
My mom has. . . 
It was a ghost. 
CC: Did she know why they were there? 
Cartwright--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 14 
HD: Only thing I know, she said the house was haunted. It's 
like, 
if 
you have somebody, 
if you're in 
love with somebody, and 
you wanta haunt'em,there's a way to do 
it. Say if you still 
love 
your (ex) husband, right? Say 
if you still do. And you just want 
to haunt him. 
In other words, you take your shoes off, and you 
just take the shoes and walk them across the floor to scare him, 
you know? Like that. 
CC: So you can do 
it by putting a curse or a spell 
on 
somebody? That kind of a way? (HD: Uh huh.) Would that be 
like 
sending a spirit to haunt the house? 
HD: That depends. Ah, 
if 
you have arguments all 
the time, or 
stuff like that, Sometimes if you're mean, you know, 
inside, and 
you don't tell nobody, you can come back out and try to scare 
somebody after death?). Really it's up to the person, what he 
does. 
CC: How do you do 
it, 
if you decide you want to scare 
somebody? 
HD: I don't know. 
CC: Did your mother think somebody was trying to do that to 
her? 
HD: Yeah; there was a witch. You believe in witches? There 
was a witch about two blocks down the road. What's going to 
happen, what time it's going to happen, (she'll tell you) the 
whole works. A Gypsy lady. 
CC: Like with dark hair and dark skin and dark eyes? 
HD (nodding): She'd read the palms of your hands, . . 
that's one lady I've seen . . . last time I seen her was about 
four years ago. 
CC: What did she tell your mom about the ghost? 
HD: She just said 
it was going to keep haunting her. Like 
her mother's hair, kept it for seven years. I don't even know 
where she put it. 
(inaudible) So 
it could be a curse on the hair, 
it could be a curse on (inaudible). 
CC: Did she try to find out what was going on, or try to 
make 
it stop? (HD shakes his head no). Did anybody else see the 
shoes? 
HD: My mom and dad can tell 
you about it. . . . 
CC: Was that in the house where you grew up? (no, 
it was in 
Medford, where his parents lived before he was born.) 
Cartwright--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 15 
HD has seen a ghost also: 
it 
looked like an ordinary man in 
a white shirt leaning over the bed or couch saying "How you 
doing?" He thought it was an ordinary person until 
it 
disappeared; now he doesn't know whether it was a ghost, or his 
imagination, or what. 
029: HD has a picture of the Devil's face tattooed on his 
right upper arm (I think he considers it Satan, but it might be 
the Jersey Devil). He was showing it to me and expressing some 
tension, fear, perhaps, about it as the tape ran out. 
"I was 
drunk when I got it," he said. 
"I don't know why I got it. 
I'm 
trying to find a way to change it. I should never have gotten 
it." I asked if he thought it was maybe dangerous to have it, but 
he said no 
I didn't get his reasoning clearly.

This tape was logged on a Marantz Superscope C-202LP by 
Elaine Thatcher on February 22, 1984. 
This tape 
is correlated 
with notes made by Christine Cartwright on USGS Quadrangle maps--
Mt. Holly and Medford Lakes Quads. 
The tape gets progressively 
quieter and harder to hear (dying batteries?). 
Counter Numbers 
000 
(Interview does not start until 011.) (Looking at quad maps. 
Mt. Holly Quadrangle.) 
G—Medford; 18GT is characterized by 
agricultural farmland, 
lake communities, and woodland 
communities. 
Ag. 
lands are mostly north of Himmelein Road. 
They 
surround the village of Medford. 
Richest ag. 
lands are north of 
Rt. 70. (Blip 
in tape--some speech lost) 
Most of the natives, or 
original settlers, 
live 
in that agricultural area in the upper 
third of the township. The middle third of the township consists 
of areas which were first settled as summer areas--the lake 
communities--Taunton Lakes, Lake Pine, Medford Lakes, Deerbrook, 
etc. 
They were settled later than the area north of Rt. 70. 
They've been there maybe 25 years. 
The third area is surrounding 
and below the borough of Medford Lakes--a woods area. 
This area 
consists of larger lots, higher priced housing, and more of the 
newer residents who have come from urban areas nearby--Cherry 
Hill, Philadelphia. 
Housing here 
is about ten years old. 
I 
can't think of one particular ethnic community in the area, 
unless you consider Quakers an ethnic group. 
Most of that is 
Cartwright--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 18 
around the village and north of the highway (70). 
There's a good 
mix of other groups--Polish, Italian, Jews--they don't live 
in 
any one community. 
They blend in. 
Ethnic, age, and income 
groups seem to be generally mixed in--although there are two or 
three higher income areas: 
Centennial Lake, Braddock's Mill. 
More inherited wealth there. 
New rich are more over in Shamong 
Twp. 
100 
The Centennial Lake and Braddock's Mill people are seen 
less than others at community events, 
in stores, at athletic 
events, etc. 
They don't have country clubs, either. 
But they 
each have common (?)clubs made up of the people who live there, 
where they have their own beach and lake, etc. 
In the Medford area, many of the activities are geared to 
children--especially sports. 
There are other organizations, 
too--playhouses, churches. 
There are no gun clubs 
in Medford 
that I know of. 
There are some further south into the Pinelands. 
There's one in Shamong--all the way down on Stokes Road. 
There's 
a large agricultural entity between Jackson Road and Medford 
village. 
Few people live there--it's environmentally sensitive, 
and 
is a great production area for cranberries and blueberries. 
The Brick family owns a lot of the bogs there. 
The area between 
Shade Road, Tabernacle Road, Tuckerton Road, and Squaw Lake is a 
bog area owned by Sharpless. 
The Quaker tradition is not as strong as other church groups 
now--especially Roman Catholic. 
There's everything here except 
Jewish and Unitarian congregations. 
But the Protestant Community 
Church, Cathedral of the Woods, takes 
in everybody. 
They bought 
the building from the Catholics, and the Catholics went and built 
a bigger church. 
200 
No Jewish and no Black people here. 
Maybe 12 Black families 
in the twp. 
There are some Korean and Japanese. 
I haven't seen 
any Puerto Ricans. 
I think the Orientals are probably 2nd 
generation or later. 
Occupations: 
Many of the people that live 
in Medford work 
in Medford. 
Own businesses, manufacturers' reps, etc. 
The other 
50% travels to other places 
in Burlington Co., Camden Co., 
Philadelphia, and New York. 
There's a dairy farm right across 
the street from us here. 
A couple of 
large horse farms--one 
thoroughbred, another is 
like English riding. 
The Sorino pig 
farm. 
All 
near the village of Medford. 
(Discussion of soil 
types 
in the twp.--see quad. maps.) 
As the land gets a little 
higher in the south, 
it's all 
sandy and dry--pine barrens. 
Of 
course, 
it has a very rich aquifer. 
300 
Medford does have a master plan. 
It's very well—regarded--
had national acclaim. 
Based on environmental resource inventory. 
It's based on areas of growth, non—growth, and moderate growth. 
It 
is 
implemented by a land development ordinance. 
I've done 
Cartwright--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 19 
three revisions. 
Pinelands affected our master plan, and we had 
to change some of our growth areas to coincide with theirs. 
We 
had to do some swaps 
in order to maintain the balance we had had 
in the last ten years. 
Then we had to revise our ordinance. 
The 
more stringent standards, whether theirs or ours, were the ones 
that were adopted in the final plan. (Tape off for phone call and 
on again.) 
Shamong township would have continued to develop at a 
very moderate pace had the Pinelands Plan not been 
in existence. 
They had a lot of development applications approved in the last 
five or six years. 
They did 
it with little regard for the 
carrying capacity of their municipality. 
Now they have to catch 
services up to that growth, but they have no new money coming in 
from development to pay for it. 
Planning helps to avoid such 
situations. 
Pinelands now won't approve a new school site that 
we're trying to establish. 
Pinelands has to prove to themselves 
that there is a compelling public need to approve the school 
site. 
400 
They have to be absolutely sure that they can eliminate any 
other school site that is available to the school board. 
If they 
don't, they might get public pressure from those property owners 
who also might want to sell 
land to the schools. 
(Christine asks for local contacts she might follow up.) 
I 
don't know of any ethnic leaders. 
END OF SIDE ONE 
000 
The pastor of the Catholic church has just been transferred 
here and 
is really too young to know any of the leaders or what 
goes on. 
The Rev. Richard Fay (sp?), the pastor of the 
protestant church at Medford Lakes may know some people. 
A good 
sports contact would be Eileen James, the recreation director 
here. 
(Tape off and on again during phone call.) 
Harry Sutton, 
the man who does all 
the landscaping for the town, 654-2601 (?) 
would be a good contact. 
(Tape off)

BEGINNING OF INTERVIEW WITH EILEEN JAMES, RECREATION 
DIRECTOR FOR G—MEDFORD; 18GT TWP. 
033 
The biggest program we have for the Pinelands is a 
Wilderness Ways (?) program. 
It 
is two weeks, and consists of a 
bike ride for kids 9-15 years of age. 
They go to our little 
airport, they take a two—mile walk 
in the pine barrens to Pakim 
Pond. 
They pack their lunch and canteens and other supplies. 
They might go swimming. 
They also take an overnight camping trip 
on which the parents can come. 
The kids prepare their own meal 
on equipment provided by the Dept. of Recreation, which also 
provides the tents. 
They take a canoe trip in the morning. 
Not 
all 
children in the program go on the campout. 
We start that in 
June and 
it goes through Labor Day. 
The Junior Women's Club also 
runs a camp in the summer. 
Three sessions. 
We provide the 
Cartwright--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 20 
money, the place, and the paperwork. 
They do the hiring and run 
the program. 
They have arts and crafts, nature, music, and 
games. 
They also do storytelling. 
100 
That program covers first through fifth or sixth grade. 
They do 
it 
in Medford Park. 
We have a preschool program which is not really a camp. 
We 
had 180 children in 
it this year. Each teacher writes their own 
schedule for the day. 
It 
is done in the school classroom, 
gymnasium, or cafeteria. 
They have playtime, arts and crafts, 
and special events on Thursdays, 
like a Fourth of July parade. 
The parade was publicized in our local newspaper. 
The second 
week last year was fire prevention--learning about fire 
prevention--memorizing the phone number of the fire dept., and 
the Thursday activity was having the firemen bring a truck over. 
200 
The next week was centered around the volunteer rescue 
squad. 
They make up first aid kits 
in Big Mac boxes. 
Last year 
we also had the trash truck come, but this year the system has 
changed, so we couldn't get a truck. 
We did the same thing with 
police. 
On Wednesday nights, we have movies 
in the park. 
They're 
all family G—rated movies. 
We haven't done anything with 
teaching kids about farms--we can't transport children. 
We also 
don't take any children except Medford Twp. children. 
Medford 
Lakes has its own recreation program--phone 654-1453. 
Joe 
Macleer is 
in charge of that. 
300 
Outside programs for children: 
sandlot baseball. 
It's 
typical of the old fashioned way of playing baseball where kids 
just get together and choose up sides and play. 
It's not 
structured at all. 
There are structured baseball clubs and camps 
in Medford. 
We also had a soccer program designed not be very 
competitive. 
We had tennis instructions from a professional 
tennis instructor. 
We geared it to the ability of each child and 
made 
it non—competitive. 
We had adult tennis in the spring. 
We have an art program. 
We have water coloring. 
Since the 
children can't be transported, we do it 
in the park. 
Medford 
is a sports—oriented area. 
Parents volunteer their 
time to run the sports programs for kids--they might coach a 
team. 
There's also a youth organization from age 8 to 14. 
It 
covers soccer, football, girls' cheerleading, girls' softball, 
boys' baseball. 
In the winter we have basketball. 
Those are all 
run by the township. 
Girl's volleyball. 
(The remaining few feet of this tape are so quiet that it 
is 
next to 
impossible to hear.)

Alvin Brick: 
When they opened the Ben Franklin Bridge 
in 
1926, 
land speculators got options on all the open ground they 
could from Camden to Medford. 
they bought my grandfather's place 
near G—Medford; 18GT 
When the Depression hit, my grandfather had 
gotten most of the money for his farm, and the investors came and 
gave the farm back to him. 
It wasn't worth anything. 
It wasn't 
going to be developed like they thought, and they didn't know how 
to farm it, 
so they couldn't get enough out of 
it to make the 
taxes, so they asked 
if he'd take 
it back--he didn't have to give 
the money back, either. 
That farm is still being farmed, 
it's 
owned by Deetz and ? now. 
It was sold again 
in about 1953 to 
them. 
It could be a truck farm, a dairy farm. 
My grandfather 
raised tomatoes, beef, potatoes, hay, I guess. 
I guess in 1927 
it went for $300 an acre or so. 
Rt. 70 was built to Medford in 
1931. 
Medford Lakes was just getting started at that time. 
Then 
things stood still until after the war. 
Essentially no 
development took place between 1928-48. 
I was here--I watched all this. 
I didn't live on the farm, 
though. 
I lived in town. 
My father left the farm and ran farms 
for other owners for a while, then went to work for his father— 
in—law, who had some cranberry interests. 
He also had an 
interest in West Jersey Bogs. 
That's how my father got into the 
cranberry business. 
Cartwright--83 Audiocassette logs

When I was growing up, most of the houses in Medford needed 
paint on them. 
It hasn't changed that much, only being fixed up. 
The central business district has changed some. 
The police 
stations used to be the railroad station. 
Rt. 70 came through 
and the circle was put in 
in 1930-31. 
Not too many changes. 
No homes have been built on Medford Main Street in my 
memory, except for a few. 
'Course, I watched all 
the lake 
communities being built. 
But there hasn't been much change in 
Medford village. 
I live out on Stokes Road. 
There are a couple 
of houses here and there. 
Rt. 70 isn't built up too much yet, 
between Marlton and Medford. 
But it's built up to Marlton now. 
I hauled cranberries this time of year into Philadelphia 
market. 
My father hauled them into Camden on a wagon. 
There 
used to be only one traffic light between here and Camden. 
This 
was about 1940-41. 
I guess they call 
it Cherry Hill 
all through 
there now. 
Not much happened between the Depression and WWII. 
It was all farmland. 
In the teens (1912-1919), my father used to 
haul produce to Camden with a horse and wagon. 
We also used to 
produce milk and put it on the train here. 
I just barely 
remember that. 
200 
My father was Quaker. 
My mother, I guess, was a Methodist. 
but when she married, she became active 
in the Quaker meeting. 
I'm not too active, though I'm a Quaker by birth. 
The church 
hasn't changed much. 
There are two 
in Medford. 
They're joined 
now, but before there were a few differences--so—called liberal 
and conservative, I suppose. 
When I was real 
small, some of the 
older Quakers probably had more conservative dress than the 
general public, but now you can't tell a Quaker from a non— 
Quaker. 
There are still a few people who use the old Quaker 
speech -- like Ed Haines, who lives here 
in Medford. 
My family 
never did. 
The 
influx of Italians and Poles 
is more recent. 
There were 
a few Italians in school with me. 
There was never any Catholic 
church here when I was growing up. 
When the area began to grow, 
those groups came in. 
300 
The Polish immigrated to the cities. 
Lots of Italians were 
farmers--they got onto little tracts of ground in Hammonton and 
did well. 
We always had a lot of Italian help from Philadelphia 
picking cranberries. 
Italian families would come at this time of 
year and stay a month or six weeks in the pickers' quarters. 
We 
built a new pickers' shanty 
in 
1938 out of concrete block with 
so—called motelroom layout. 
The old buildings were of all 
descriptions. 
Some cooking utensils were furnished, with a 
regular cookhouse affair. 
They did their own cooking. 
Brick 
ovens with iron tops--four or five of them the size of this table 
that could be fired four ways (sides?). 
The older people could 
only speak Italian. 
All 
of that (Italian workers' presence) 
ended about 1941 -- as far as I was concerned. 
Cartwright--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 23 
400 
The men scooped berries. 
The women and children hand— 
picked. 
We used to get quite a few pickers from Waterford and 
Atco areas. 
Some of them had their own farms. 
It added to their 
income. 
Not many of the Waterford people lived on our property 
during picking.

erto Ricans are generally faster.

We dry harvest cranberries. 
A lot of people in Chatsworth can give you more folklore 
than I can, as far as pinelands is concerned. 
Things like 
charcoal making, picking wild huckleberries, picking cranberries 
and greens, working in the swamps, cutting the cedar. 
I've 
harvested a lot of cedar for our own use.

This tape logged from a Marantz Superscope C-202LP by 
Elaine Thatcher on February 23, 1984. 
This tape has three 
components: 
Side one is a continuation of an 
interview with 
Eileen James, continued from side two of PFP83—ACC005. 
This part 
of the tape is almost totally lost due to battery failure. 
The 
speed of the tape 
is maintained, but the sound fades to nothing 
very soon after the beginning of the tape. 
Side two has some 
taped comments from Christine while she was driving in her car 
after she realized the batteries had died on the tape recorder 
and replaced them. 
After that is 
an interview with Mrs. X, 
an 
organizer of the Medford Apple Festival, who gives a tour of the 
grounds at Kirby's Mill, where the festival will be held.

Eileen James: 
If 
it weren't for lots of parents 
volunteering their time to help with our children's programs, we 
couldn't run them with the degree of efficiency that we do. 
That 
is for camping, sports, etc. 
Lots of families go to the park to 
see our movies. 
Some families reserve the park for reunions and 
picnics. 
We 
lend equipment for them to use--volleyball, 
badminton, etc. 
G—Medford; 18GT 
(Tape fades beyond understanding at this point, unless the 
listener is 
in a very quiet room.) 
SIDE TWO 
000 
Christine Cartwright: 
I'm going along the main drag of 
Cartwright--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 25 
Medford toward Kirby's Mill. 
I'm passing an Assembly of God New 
Life Center on the 
left side. 
I took some pictures of a man 
mowing his lawn--he was very willing. 
He pointed out some 
gingerbread trim under the gables of his house and said that most 
people wouldn't bother with that, but there's a twp. ordinance 
that they have to 
leave 
it on--they want Medford to stay old— 
Iooking. 
On the tape of Eileen James that was lost through battery 
failure, was a description of the Memorial Day Parade and the 
Halloween Parade which are G—Medford; 18GT (celebration) traditions. 
Anyone who wants to be 
in the Halloween parade can be. 
Most wear 
traditional Halloween costumes--they judge a costume contest. 
Held in evening. 
Halloween--floats from outlying communities and 
high schools. 
Prize for best float. 
Boy, Girl and Cub Scout 
troops march, and emergency units (fire, police, ambulance). 
The 
Memorial Day Parade hands out ice cream after the parade. 
This 
parade only involves people from Medford proper, and 
it goes to 
all 
the cemeteries and they say a prayer at each cemetery. 
They 
try to get 3 or 4 clergymen for this, but they're hard to find on 
Memorial Day because of competing activities. 
Memorial Day 
parade involves lots of patriotic themes. 
Twp. recreation 
programs will have been making things and talking about patriotic 
themes all week before the parade. 
TX02: (Christine stops at G—Kirby's Mill; 18GT to take pictures 
before the Apple Festival. 
The tape picks up with Mrs. X talking 
about the site.) 
This is the old carriage shop. 
The building 
was built the same time as the blacksmith shop here. 
There are 
big double doors on the second floor, because they used to have a 
ramp and they would push the carriages up there to the second 
floor to work on them. 
Around 1300, the Kirby brothers built 
this other end on, because with the coming of the car, they 
needed more space. 
One of the times that it was roofed together 
as one building was during World War II, and the story goes that 
Mr. Bunning (sp?) was up doing the roofing when the train whistle 
came from Mt. Holly. 
He took his horse and wagon and beat the 
train to Medford--he wondered what had happened, because the 
whistle blew continually. 
They found out the armistice had been 
signed. 
That's one way we can remember when our building was 
roofed together. 
The other part was called the storage building. 
They used 
to run their block and tackle up there so they could move grain 
bags (between the parts of the building?). 
The Kirby family 
still has the feed store 
in town. 
The mill was built during the 
Revolution. 
Can you imagine constructing this by man power, 
lifting those beams? 
100 
In our carpenter shop we have an old drill with a bit that 
will fit that peg hole. 
(Discussion of the mortise and pin 
construction--a man joins in the conversation briefly.) 
A lot of 
our chutes here--some are pillars to hold the building up, and 
Cartwright--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 26 
others are hollow to accommodate the belts and cups that lift 
grain up to the second floor and third floor. 
Some of the old 
belts are still 
up on the fourth floor. 
On the third floor, 
there's a worm, or thing like a wooden screw--a threaded shaft--
that pushes the grain horizontally. 
We call this part the "new 
addition," but it was built around 1860. 
That is where we chose 
to make our kitchens and lavatories. 
We have a lovely quilt show 
here 
in June, and both floors are hung with handmade quilts. 
We 
have more things--our museum --on the second floor. 
One thing 
we're doing-- one of our prominent members passed away a couple 
of years ago, and we have a water wheel fund, so that one day we 
will put a water wheel out here in his memory. 
He was 
instrumental 
in getting the building, and he put the kitchens and 
bathrooms on, 
he did the wiring, put in the speakers. 
His name 
was Clyde Levan. 
Here's our chart--we've only gotten $4000 so 
far. 
(Tape off while Christine looks around, then on again with 
Mrs. X.) 
The Apple Festival started about five years ago after our 
quilt show. 
I told them we should do an apple festival and 
feature apples, and they made me the chairman. 
We decided we 
weren't going to be a fall festival, because there are lots of 
fall festivals, we were going to be an apple festival. 
We 
decided to feature early American crafts and everything to do 
with apples. 
We also have some Victorian crafts. 
We have the 
blacksmith set up, and the whole area is filled with crafts. 
We 
don't want things that aren't hand made, and we don't want things 
that wouldn't have been around at that time, and we'll ask people 
to 
leave 
if they don't meet those criteria. 
We have two big 
apple butter tubs cooking with apple butter, and a cider press 
(ca. 1865). 
Cols (sp?) Roberts gives us the press, because he's 
our local apple man. 
200 
Tom Chavis oversees the apple squeezer--the children love 
it. 
We can't squeeze it fast enough. 
My husband oversees the 
apple butter tubs and the fire. 
It takes about six to eight 
hours to make apple butter. 
We sell apples, candied apples, 
dried apples, apple ciders. 
In the morning we have a bake—off. 
It started out with apple dessert, but we've added a category for 
other kinds of apple recipes--potatoes and apples, meat and 
apples, etc. 
At noon we have a function for the school children 
--one year we told them to write a story about apples. 
We've 
asked them off the cuff to write an apple recipe--they're really 
fun. 
(She makes an aside to Tom Chavis--the man who has been 
talking here and there-- about a recipe where a child said to get 
a bushel of African apples. 
He suggests that it might have been 
a Black child that wrote the recipe. 
Then he says one child 
submitted a riddle-- "What's big on the sides, has a dell 
in 
the 
middle, rugged hills on the edges, burned to a crisp, and the 
bottom is 
like mush? --My mother's apple pie." 
And in the poem 
he had the instructions for doing it. 
Another man comes in and 
talks about setting his broom corn outside -- he makes brooms. 
He asks about Christine's tape recorder. 
He says he has fifteen 
Cartwright--83 Audiocassette logs 
page 27 
different styles, and this year he has two genuine old pieces of 
equipment that he has acquired. 
He says he'll eventually move 
out of Medford Lakes onto a farm somewhere in Pemberton Township. 
300 
Mrs. X says she hopes that the Apple Festival people have 
helped the broom man's business grow. 
He says they have. 
Tom 
says he's the only Ph.D. broommaker he knows. 
The broommaker 
says there's another one, who 
is a geneticist working on the 
raising of broom corn. 
Discussion of broom supplies and their 
problems and advantages. 
The broommaker is going to work with 
this geneticist at Burlington County College. He talks about 
figuring out which people who come by will buy a broom. 
400 
Mrs. X: A policeman told me that last year they had 10,000 
people at the Apple Festival. 
The police are helping with crowd 
control. 
Ella Corn 
is 
in charge of the craft people, and she has 
fifty craft people here, but it has gone from colonial 
to 
colonial and Victorian. 
I've been very selective--no balloons, 
cotton candy, etc. 
I had a very upsetting time with a man who 
wanted to do funnel 
(?) cakes once. 
We sell the food--that is 
our moneymaker, except for the booth rental. 
We don't take a 
percentage of the profit.
