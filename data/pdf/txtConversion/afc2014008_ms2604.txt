The Homogeneity of African-New World Negro Musical Style*
 
Alan Lomax
 
This paper is all prologue--all Africa and very little New World.
 
It addresses itself to the old question of the survival of Negro culture
 
patterns in the Americas, rather than to the new regional adaptations of
 
that pattern.  Afro-American song style, so much in dispute among scholars,
 
is seen, in the perspective of world song style study, as no more than
 
a typical member of one African style family, one of the many outcomes of
 
African style, which is perhaps the most ancient, consistent and fertile
 
of world musical families.
 
These conclusions were reached through the use of a system for rating
 
song performance called Cantonietrics, which is the jo it invention of
 
Victor Grauer and myself.  The C
.tntometric rating s
)
t enables trained
 
judges to score a seri es  of recor
ded  song perform
s on the relative
 
presence or absence of a numbe r of pre
-defi ned  c
 acteristics.
 (For
 
further explication ofiCantometric s, the reader
 referred to 4arlier
 
sources--Loma
,x:1962, 1967; Lomax et al:1968, in press.)  This empirical
 
rating scheme was applied to 2500-plus songs from 233 cultures, for which
 
information on social structure was available in George Murdock's
 
Ethnographic Atlas (
Ethnology, 1962-
 )
. The cultures were assigned
 
to culture areas  in accordance with the Murdock culture area -system.  The
 
layout of the African sample appears in Figure 1
.  The three-digit figures
 
are area cue numbers; the number  by each culture name refers to the nur
it'.r of
 
songs per culture coded.
 
When each batch of songs has been punched and compute    
the
 
computer assembl s areal profiles.  These profiles are assumed to be
 
statements about the most frequent musical behaviors likely to be
 
encountered per area.  The following display shows two modal song
 
performance profiles as rated for Cntometrics- -one for African Hunters
 
and one for Sahara (
see Figures 2 and
. 3
).
 
A second program computed the similarities between 5
6 such style
 
profiles for areas covered by the Cantometric survey.  Thereupon a factor
 
analysis of the table of similarities between each of the 5
6 areas and
 
all others produced clusters of the most closely linked areas.
 (For
 
further exp T
h
.nwtion of the statistical considerations involved, see
 
Appendices 1 and 2
, Lomax et al: 1968.)  The results of the factor
 
analysis are displayed in Fi g
ure J, where the coÃ±trjhutj n

to the set of six geographical factors found by the computer is set forth.
 
In effect, this is a computer map of world song style regions, where all
 
the 5
6 areas are rank ordered in terms of the weight of their contribution
 
to the regional factor.  It will be noted that  above the 50% level, each
 
cluster of cultures outlines a grand culture region of continental
 
dimensions.  The least homogeneous of these are South America and the
 
Pacific, while North America, the Orient and Africa show up on these
 
lists as highly homogeneous--that is, most of the areas within the
 
region appear over the 50% level and many much higher than that.  If
 
this regional factor geography is ordered in the rank of descending
 
homogeneity, Africa, centering round the style of Equatorial Africa,
 
is seen to be the most homogeneous song style area in
 
world.
 The upper third of the African factor includes all of
 
Nigritic Africa plus Madagascar and Afro-America.  Half the spread of
 
similarity includes all African areas South of the Sahara and only one
 
out-of-Africa area, West Polynesia.  Further down the list, below the
 
level of in-region factor loading, we find Tribal India in its only
 
similarity occurrence in this comparison.  All Cintometric style
 
comparisons keep asserting and reasserting the strong trans-Indian Ocean
 
links between the East Coast of Africa, Tribal India and non-Malaysian
 
Oceania.  At the level of 3
5%, the Sahara (which includes Nubia and the
 
Shiuh) shows a weak relation to the African pattern.
 
The next regional factor in order of importance and homogen ity is
 
an enormous area stretching right round the globe from Japan to Mauritania,
 
and including all those areas formed or touched by the development of
 
classical civilization.  This region, which we have called Old High Culture,
 
embraces the urban-peasant cultures of the Mediterranean and thus includes
 
North Africa and the Sahara above the 50% similarity level.  N.E. Bantu,  
which encompasses the interlacustrine kingdom of the. Watutsi and the
 
Bahima, also shows its attachment to this region.  Thus the African
 
song style area from the regional point-of-view seems to be laid out
 
as follows:
 
1
.  A Negro heartland, including Madagascar and Afro-America.
 
2.  A transition area between the Sahara and
. the Bantu
' heartland,.
 
including Western Sudan and N.E. Bantu, Upper Nile, Moslem
 
Sudan and
. Ethiopia (
above 5
5%).
 
3
.  The African hunter-gatherer cultures--Pygmy and Bushman (
above 50%).
 
.
 The Saharan fringe to the North, strongly influencing N.E. Bantu (
35%).
 
The cantometric system looks at song performance as a specialized
 
act of communication whose principal function is to organize the response
 
of human collectives in ritual or ritualized situations.
 It views
 
all song performances in terms of three basic models:

.  Well-integrated and highly cohesive group performance in
 
which the participants conform to an agreed upon communication
 
plan in a highly disciplined an&orderly manner.
 
2
.  Moderately or poorly coordinated group performances, in which
 
the participants follow the agreed upon plan but show a
 
relative degree of independence from it.
 
3  Solo performance in which a skilled virtuoso dominates the
 
co m
munication space for a period, thus imposing his communication
 
upon his more or less silent and passive listeners.
 
The extraordinary homogeneity of African song style is the result of
 
the a
lmost universal importance among Africans of the first of these
 
models--the highly cohesive, complexly integrated song model.  It
 
is, of course, a truism that Negro Africans have the ability to
 
synchronize their motor and their vocal act more readily than the people
 
of most other culture regions.  The set of Cantometric style traits that
 
contribute to the cohesiveness of a style are shown in what follows to
 
knit all the African areas together into a tight stylistic cluster.  The
 
vertical bars on the chart in Figure 5 stand for the full spread of
 
these groupy song traits in the whole world sample.  Each horizontal
 
line marks the position of an African culture area on one of these style
 
definers, and inspection of the chart indicates that African areas tend to
 
form one set in relation to them.  Reading from left to right, one
 
notes that when most Africans sing they:
 
are non-tense, vocally
 
quite repetitious, textually
 
rather slurred in enunciation
 
lacking in embellishment and free rhythm
 
low on exclusive leadership
 
high on antiphony, chorally
 
especially high on overlapped antiphony
 
high on one-phrase melodies, on litany form
 
very cohesive, tonally and rhythmically in chorus
 
high on choral integration or part-singing
 
high on relaxed vocalizing
 
highest on polyrhythmic (
or hot) accompaniments.
 
This relaxed, cohesive, multi-leveled, yet leader-oriented style,
 
which dominates African song from the Cape of Good Hope to the Straits
 
of Gibraltar and West into the American colonies, is the source and
 
symbol of African cultural homogeneity.  Further study of the distributions
 
on Figure-5 points to another important fact--that the African center
 
lies between the two historic poles of African cultural history--
Egypt and
. Mediterranean Civilization to the North, and the culture of
 
the ancient African hunters in the South.  These appositions can be
 
traced all across the chart in Figure 5 when it is realized that North Africa

NOTE:  The vertical lines represent percent scales of 13 Cantometric Traits from 0 to 100.  The
 
position of each African culture area is represented on each s
cale by a symbol--sce legend--
showing the importance of a trait in that particular area.  By fo1lo;ing the cross-hatched
 
arrows one can see that African Hunters are low on all complexity scales and high on all
 
integration scales.  The oDposite condition holds true for  North Africa, vhich is high on
 
all complexity scales and low on all but two integration scales--litany and polyr'nr he,
 
which are basic traits of African song.  The dots and bars standing for the rest of Africa
 
generally fall in bct een these two extremes wi t

established between level of productive and social complexity
 
and degree of wordiness in song texts, precision of enunciation,

S
everal conclusions are indicated:
 
1)  That Negro song style is somehow the product of two influences:
 
a)  leadership, dominance oriented, information-heavy Old
 
High Culture to the North;  b) acephalous, groupy, non-specifying
 
African Hunter culture at the Center and in the South.
 
2)  That the majority of Negro song styles are oriented more strongly
 
toward
 groupiness, integration and non-specificity than
 
in the opposite direction.  In other words, Negro song seems
 
to be African Hunter or Pygmoid in type.

-9
 
All integrative traits reach their peak of frequency among the
 
Pygmy-Bushman remnants in Africa.
 Since the ancestors of these
 
African gatherer-hunters have inhabited most of the African continent
 
since Paleolithic times, it seems logical to attribute this style trace
 
to them.  Considered in this way, African hunter song style is the
 
most extreme form of the African groupy model.  It lends a strongly
 
African color to the polyrhytbziic music of the North African desert.
 
It has more and more come to dominate the style of the Negro population
 
to the South.  The recent history of the African continent--the last
 
2000 years--is of its gradual occupation by Negro gardeners and
. pastoralists.
 
As Negro tribes moved
. East and South into the jungle, they displaced,
 
often absorbed or established symbiotic relationships with the African
 
Hunters, at the same time apparently acquiring their musical style.
 
Evidence is everywhere at hand to support this idea:
 
i)  many tribes sing in the hocketing, yodeling, contrapuntal
 
Pygmy style.  In all cases these are folk who have only recently
 
replaced or still live in conjunction with the hunters.
 
2)  These Pygmoid songs are usually the most conservative in type--
funeral songs, secret ritual songs.
 
3
)  The tribes whose general style is most Pygmoid are close
 
neighbors or show strong hunter culture influence--notably the
 
South African Zulus, Xhosa, etc., who intermarried with the
 
Bushmen and have Khoisan clicks in their language as well as
 
Bushman traces in their music.
 
4
)  Pygmoid style fades out and disappears among Nilotes, Berbers,
 
Arabs, Cushites and other peoples to the North and East.
 
The common stylistic thread which unites all Africa is repetitious,
 
cohesive, overlapping or interlocked, multi-leveled
., and
.  hot.
 This
 
style is primal in Africa for our evidence points to the African
 
gatherers as the inventors of counterpoint and hot rhythm; certainly they
 
are the most skillful practitioners of these arts among all primitive
 
people.
 
The ancient Pygmy-Bushman strain touches even the solo song styles of
 
Africa.  The female bards of the Tuareg, the poets along the Nile, the
 
singing historians of the Watutsi, the praise singers of the Hausa,
 
the court poets of the Zulu, the blues men and Calypsonians of the
 
Americas--all practice a model of solo singing somewhat different from
 
that of the rest of the world.  In African solo singing voices tend to
 
be more relaxed and
. playful--there is more verbal repetition and more
 
slurred enunciation; orchestras are more frequently polyphonic and hot.
 
Most of all the Pygmy-Bushman signatures, interlock and overlap--cross
 
talk between members of the orchestra, between the instruments and the
 
singer and sometim es even between a singer and a supporting solo voice-
-
give African solo-accompanied style its distinctive flavor.
 
-
 10 - 
 
'
I
 
African stylistic unity may then be explained, at a first level,
 
as the result of a unique and
. universal African experience--encounter
 
with and absorption of the rhythmic traditions (
song and dance) of the
 
little people of Africa, already famed for their abilities as dancers in
 
the time of the Pharoahs.  The principal finding of Cntometrics,
 
however, is that song style functions as a suitable symbol for and
 
reinforcement of social norms.  We should, therefore, expect to find
 
that the integrative hunter style is suitable to the life style of
 
African g
irdeners.  In terms of correlations, established at the P  .
 .
001
 
level, African hunter style signals:
 
1)  high complementarity between males and females
 
2)  social cohesiveness and
. solidarity
 
3
)  delight in repetition
 
an atmosphere of pleasurable eroticism
 
5
)  part interchangeability--multi-leveled integration.
 
(For details of these correlations see Lomax:1968,
 as well
 
as note on correlations at end of article.)
 
If more specificity (
wordy-precise) and an emphasis on clearcut
 
leader roles (antiphony and solo) are added to this complex, the resulting
 
combination is African Negro song and life style.  Furthermore, this Negro
 
adaptation of Pygmy communication style seems perfectly suited to the
 
recent history of the African people.
 
About 1500
 years ago, as Murdock tells the story, Negro tribes
 
received the Malaysian crop complex, suitable for tropical agriculture,
 
and could expand South and East into the African forest, displacing the
 
hunter-
therer peoples who had held this territory for thousands of
 
years.  Key components in this tropical gardening complex were the
 
yam and the banana--crops which generally involve teams of males clearing
 
and breaking the land and teams of females performing subsequent
 
operations.  The African yam gardening behavior not only depends heavily
 
on the involvement of women in agriculture, but also upon large, highly
 
coordinated teams, synchronously performing simple, monotonous tasks
 
such as hoeing, weeding, paddling, transporting, hauling logs, using
 
the mortar and pestle, etc.  In our finding, song style varies with sub-
sistence type and work team organization, cross-culturally (
see Lomax:1968 )
.
 
African hunter style evolved in a society primarily dependent on a
 
feminine work team--the group of gathering women.  It was, therefore,
 
feminized, cohesive, playfully erotic, and the most tightly and complexly
 
synchronized of styles--in these respects perfectly suited to the needs
 
of African gardeners.  In Negro choruses, acephalous, interlocked Pgymy
 
choral organization was largely replaced by antiphonal overlap or alterna-
tion in which a dominant leader is singled out, but which also reflects
 
the most universal of African political institutions, the yea-saying,
 
responsorial, not-to-be-silenced council of village elders.
 
The erotic content of Pygmy song was of service to an expanding
 
economy, that needed manpower for its growing lineages.  Fertility and
 
sexual prowess are central values in African life.
 Students of African
 
dance testify that many dances are designed to educate boys and girls
 
for their adult sexual roles in a polygynous world.  Our world survey of
 
dance shows that African cultures lead all the rest in the use of bodily
 
polyrhrthxn, in which the trunk and the pelvis of the dancer and the hands
 
and sticks of drummers steadily maintain two separate and conflicting
 
meters.  This twisting pelvic
 ..
 -
 style (and its reflection in hot
 
rhythm) infus  African work and play with a steady feed of pleasurable
 
erotic stimn i, and thus these polyrhythms, and acoustics, and kinesics
 
transform monotonous tasks into group amusements.
 
The non-complex structure of text and tune and the multi-leveled
 
structure of Pygmy-Negro performance style afford added incentives for
 
group participation, opening the door for anyone to make a contrastive
 
and complimentary personal contribution to the whole sound.  Where
 
the whole society is needed to accomplish heavy, monotonous hand
 
labor in intense heat, we find a communication style maximally
 
inviting, encouraging and eroticizing participation by all present.
 
This style was continued under slavery and now forms the baseline for
 
the entire Afro-American tradition.
 
4hen the computer compares the similarities of the cultures in the
 
African set analyzed by Cantometrics, the regional system previously
 
presented is confirmed and somewhat refined
..  A seven area classification
 
of African song style emerges that reflects in a surprising measure the
 
broad currents of African ethnography.  Two criteria are brought to bear
 
successively on each culture in order to find which cluster it is
 
most closely related to:
 
J
 
1)  The world regional criterion.  We rank order all the similarities
 
of the 6
6 cultures in the sample that lie within the African
 
continent, and cut this rank order at the quartile.  In
 
order for a culture to be considered African, a larger percent
 
of its inter-cultural affiliations must lie above the quartile
 
than its similarities with any other of the six world areas.
 
All but nine of the 6
6 African cultures passed this test, and
 
eight of these came from Ethiopia, Sahara, North Africa, the
 
areas which had shown stronger areal affiliations to Old
 
High Culture than to Africa.
 
2)  The areal criterion.  In the same way, we look above the quartile
 
in the search for the area that is most similar to each culture.
 
The first named area is considered the main areal classifier of
 
each culture.  In case two adjoining areas seem to alternate
 
at the peak of similarity for adjacent cultures that are
 
similar in other ways, either or both of these areas act as
 
areal classifiers.  All the cultures in groups V
, VI and VII
 
proclaimed their strong inter-similarity to most of the
 
others in this way, but were classified into sets because
 
of moderate tendencies in one direction or another.  The
 
cultures in group V were most similar to Central or Equatorial
 
Bantu or to one of the other areas that included
, the cultures
 
in this set.
 
In the classification that follows, the main criterion for each group
 
is presented briefly beneath the areal title.  The digit before each
 
name represents the percent importance of animal husbandry in the
 
subsistence activities of that culture, as given in the Ethnographic
 
Atlas.  The letter code after the name gives the main subsistence type,
 
according to a typology developed by Arensberg and Lomax out of
 
Murdock (Lomax:1968).
 It will be noted that the cultures in both the
 
North African and Cushitic groups are more complex in subsistence
 
practices and depend more upon animal husbandry than most members of
 
the other five areal groups.  The Nilotes and the South African sets
 
(
III and v
i) practice more animal husbandry than other African simple
 
cultivators.  The style of the simplest of African producers, the
 
African Hunters, has survived most vividly among the Eastern Sudanics,
 
subsistence-wise the least complex of all remaining African cultivators.
 
The relevancy of this scheme of classification to the cultural
 
and historical geography of Africa becomes more apparent when it
 
is presented on a map of African cultures (adapted from Murdock).

still is lower on complementarity and cohesiveness and higher on
 
dominance and specificity than the Gardener types.

.  Gardener. The diffusion of the yam gardener complex is traced
 
east into the forests of Nigeria, Equatorial, Lacustrine and
. Central
 
Africa, to the Indian Ocean and
. the Cape of Good Hope.  A Central
 
African style (notably Lala, Luba, Luvale) stands at the center of
 
the cluster.
 It comes from a relatively open plain and forest area,
 
where Murdock points out that the yam gardener had to re-acquire an
 
economic pattern from the North and East.  This set is so tightly
 
linked that it is impossible to divide it further.
 It includes
 
most of West and Equatorial Africa, along with Madagascar and
 
Afro-America.  There is a general drop in the importance of animal
 
husbandry.  The American cultures form a subgroup with a more
 
complex subsistence pattern.  Merina shows a strong link with
 
Polynesian song style; it is highly specific, precise, well-blended,
 
polyphonic, and has a simple choral organization--all standout
 
traits of Maritime Pacific.

.  South African. This style is closely tied with style 5
.
 
However, increased frequency of solo indicates complexity, while
 
higher frequency of integration factors indicates absorption of
 
Bushman influence.
 
7
.  East Sudanic. This style is tied to style 6
.  Use of
 
specific African hunter traits such as hocketing, yodeling, interlock,
 
rhythmic counterpoint '
show these cultures are feedlines for persistent
 
hunter influence.
 
8.  African Hunter. This style is found in pockets all across Africa.
 
Everything that we have learned from looking at clusters of
 
African song styles confirm s the areal findings.
 Africa is an
 
extremely homogeneous musical region,  split along the southern
 
Saharan border.  This border land looks in two directions: 1) to
 
the complex or pastoral and irrigation cultures of the North;
 
2) to the simpler gardening cultures with their African hunter
 
center in the South.  In this border area, among the Nilotes and the
 
Nubians too, there are hints of an old level of African Negro
 
singing in which no African hunter influence is perceptible.  This
 
style--which has so much in common with the present-day singing
 
of the Ethiopian pastoralists, of the Arabian Bedouins, of the
 
tribes of India, and even of the people of far-distant Oceania-
-
remains the African mystery.
 
Meantime, we can perceive that the principal African musical
 
style developed out of the melting pot of the West Sudan and West Africa,
 
was touched with bardic influences from the North and acquired more'
 
and more African hunter elements as the Negro tribes ranged east and
 
south through the whole Continent.
 Seen from this broad perspective, the
 
song styles of Afro-America are, first and foremost, extensions of
 
the cohesive tradition of African gardeners in the Western Hemisphere.

A line-by-line Cantometric analysis, however, points to one strong
 
influence upon Negro singing in the West--that of European folk style.
 
The most distinctive feature of West European song is the. st
ightf r ard
 
presentation of content-loaded,  simple strophes.  The Afro-American
 
profile varies markedly from that with Africa only in relation to this
 
West European feature.
 Afro-America is:  1) the only African area
 
in the first quartile for four-phrase strophes, where Europe leads
 
the world; 2) the only African area below the median for complex litany
 
(all African Bantu areas are in the first quartile here); 3
) the only
 
African area above the median on medium length phrases (here West
 
Europe leads the world); L
i
.) the only area of African heartland in the
 
first quartile for normal accent and above the median on wordiness, where
 
Europe is in both respects outstanding; 5
) the only African
 
area below the median on fast tempo besides the Guinea Coast, which
 
it strongly resembles; 6
) the highest of all African areas in employ-
ment of sim ple meter, an important trait of both West Europe and
 
Africa.
 
In all other respects, Afro-American style is virtually identical
 
with that of the African heartland.
 Its two closest cogeners are
 
Equatorial Bantu, at 8
5% similarity, and Guinea Coast, at 8
1t-
%
 
similarity.  This conclusion contrasts strongly with that of many
 
other recent studies of the subject.  These analyses compare printed
  
versions of the melodies and the poetic texts of Negro and white
 
spirituals.  If these two features are examined out of the context
 
of performance, available on recordings, many American Negro songs seem
 
to be adaptations of white hymns or folk spirituals.  Because of the
 
pile-up of such evidence, George Pullen Jackson, who devoted a major
 
part of his career to the comparison of printed versions of white and
 
Negro sacred songs, concluded that there was not one shred of
 
originality in the American Negro spirituals, that all were derived from
 
white models.
 In one of his last publications, he said defiantly:
 
"
If there's a Nigger in this woodpile, I haven't found him yet."
 
Cantometric analysis points conclusively in another direction--that
 
the main traditions of Afro-American song, especially those of the old-
time congregational spiritual, are
 
derived from the main African song style model.  European song style
 
did influence the African tradition in America in regard to melodic
 
form and, of course, textual content.  But in most other respects,
 
Afro-American song has hewed to the main dynamic line of the principal
 
African tradition.  As we have shown, this tradition is perhaps the
 
most stable and the most ancient and in many ways the most highly
 
developed of the musical languages of mankind.

AN APPEAL FOR CULTURALEEQUITY
 Alan Lomax
 
How can we maintain the varied artistic styles which help to
 
make this nation an agreeable place to live? One senses on
 
every hand the oppressive dullness and the psychic distress
 
of those areas where centralized music industries, exploiting
 
the star system and controlling the communication networks,
 
have put the local musician out of work and silenced folk
 
song, tribal ritual,  local popular festivities and regional
 
culture.
 
Scientific study of cultures, notably of their languages and
 
their musics, shows that all are equally valuable:  first,
 
because they enrich the lives of the people who use them and
 
whose very morale is threatened when they are impoverished or
 
destroyed; second, because each communicative system (whether
 
verbal, visual, musical, or even culinary) holds important
 
discoveries about the natural and human environment; third,
 
because each is a treasure of unknown potential, a collective
 
creation in which some branch of the human species invested
 
its genius across the centuries.
 
The only way to halt the loss of our national cultural heritage
 
is to commit ourselves to the principle of cultural equity, as
 
we have committed ourselves to the principles of political
 
and social equity. Thomas Jefferson was certainly thinking of
 
cultural equity when he wrote in the Declaration of Independence
 
"that all men are created equal and endowed with the inalienable
 
right to life,  liberty and the pursuit of happiness." We now
 
understand that Jefferson's luminous phrase means more than the
 
right of the individual to "do his thing." It means the right
 
of every community or ethnic group to its own way of life,
 
its own culture -
 that group heritage, customs, art and
 
language that gives every human group its sense of identity,
 
continuity and satisfaction. The importance given to national
 
unity and quick communication have caused this nation to forget
 
or devalue these all-important cultural differences, which
 
Jefferson defines as inalienable human rights. The rich
 
variety of accent, of posture, of song, and of local custom
 
have been sacrificed to mainstream conformity. Our ethnic
 
heritage has not been melted down, but it has been degraded.
 
Indeed, the pace of reduction of cultural differences has
 
so accelerated that many assume the total disappearance.
 
Yet there is another trend afoot. Culture pattern is tough,
 
because it is both invisible and omnipresent. We can retain
 
our varied ways of pursuing happiness if we take pains now.
 
A first move against cultural pollution is to give all
 
cultures a) a fair share of time on the airwaves and b) time
 
in the classroom. When country folk, urban ethnics, or
 
tribal peoples hear or view their own traditions, projected
 
with the authority generally reserved for the output of
 
Madison Avenue, and when they hear their traditions taught
 
to their own children in school, something magical occurs.
 
They see that their expressive styles are as good as that
 
of others and, if they are permitted, they will continue
 
them.
 
During the 1920's a few southern radio stations began to
 
broadcast the music of the Appalachian mountains. Local
 
audiences bought the products advertised on the programs,
 
so that other southern stations followed suit, and today
 
we have a vigorous modern southern rural musical tradition
 
with several indigenous forms of orchestration that match
 
in virtuosity the storied orchestras of Spain and central
 
Europe. This occured because talented carriers of a folk
 
tradition were allowed to have their share of broadcast
 
time.
 
Another instance -
-
 the flowering of Black orchestral music
 
in New Orleans -
-
 came about because Black musicians found
 
steady, high-paying jobs and prestige in the amusement dis-
trict, and they had time to reorchestrate and then record
 
this local music for export to the whole world.
 
The Festival of American Folklife marks a further step
 
forward. Our folk artists and craftsmen -
 the fiddlers,
 
the blues guitarists, the blanket weavers, the cooks, the
 
Mariachi musicians, the telephone linemen -
 brought from
 
all over the United States and set down in the midst of
 
the most powerful national symbols, step out onto the
 
middle of the stage to receive the attention they deserve.
 
They return home, stronger in their own eyes and more
 
respected in their own communities. The principle effect
 
of the Festival seems to be in this validation of local
 
culture and of local folk artists.
 
By giving every culture its equal access to audiences,  its
 
equal time on the air, and its equal weight in education,
 
we can come closer to the realization of the principles of
 
Jefferson's declaration. Twentieth-century communications
 
systems and recording devices,  in fact, make it possible
 
for the oral traditions to reach their audiences, to
 
establish their libraries and museums, to preserve and
 
record their songs, tales, and dramas directly in sound
 
and vision without weiting and printing them in another
 
media. So today we see native American tribes recording
 
for their own archives their own sacred literature,
 
broadcasting age-old sacred rituals over their own local
 
,radio stations for the spiritual refreshment and education
 
of their youth.
 
Thus, neither universal education nor communication need
 
necessarily destroy local traditionB, provided that the many
 
customs and the many media channels we possess are shared
 
so as to provide support for a multiple heritage. But the
 
cultural myopia of the past must be put aside 80  that the
 
unwritten, non-verbal traditions may be endowed with the
 
status and the space they deserve.
 
The next hundred years should put the principle of cultural
 
equity on a par with the principles of political liberty
 
'
 and social justice on which our national life was founded,
 
il
 so that every region and every group may find't4 â€”

A FUTURE FOR ANTHROPOLOGY:
 
Aesthetic Anthropology
 
by Alan Lomax
 
Now that we have studied culture in all its
 
variations,  now that we understand its importance in human
 
evolution, we should,  it seems to me,  become its proponents
 
in world planning.
 Our central concern becomes the quality
 
of human life.
 Our focus becomes diversity rather than
 
unity.
 During the rise of nations,  of industry, of science,
 
the emphasis of intellectuals was necessarily upon standar-
dization.
 We can now see that standardization has a negative
 
effect upon many aspects of life--upon the community,  upon
 
education,  upon the arts.
 The Systems concept has shown us
 
that living systems depend upon a profusion of interlocked
 
but often dissimilar and semi-independent parts and processes.
 
Human culture is such a macro-system  -
of ecologies,
 
life-styles,  and expressive patterns,  dependent for its
 
flowering on cultural cross-fertilization and thus on diver-
sity.
 Anthropology,  as the discoverer of culture,  should now
 
take the responsibility of maintaining and transforming this
 
essential cultural diversity into the planetary multi-civili-
zation which mankind requires for a healthy future.  At
 
present our activity tends to enrich only one stream of
 
culture-- that of western civilization.
 
-1-
s  LOMAX
 
This century has witnessed a dramatic shrinking of
 
the range and number of human cultures under the pressure
 
of the Euro-American mainstr n tradition of mass marketing,
 
centralized communication and universal education.  Anthropology's
 
discovery of the enormous variation in cultures, of their
 
intrinsic and diverse values,  their ecological and adaptive
 
importance and of their fundamental contribution to the morale
 
of individuals and communities becomes ironic as we see the
 
vast universe of cultures being wiped out or brought into
 
conformity with a few models.
 
This process can no longer
 
be defended because it is essential to the future of indus-
trilization or nationhood,  for now we know that neither of
 
these institutions provides adequate solutions for our human
 
problems.
 
Our self-assigned t -
 has been to know and document
 
and understand the small non-mainstream cultures of the planet.
 
It is now our responsibility to come to their defense,  to
 
mediate for them,  to take a hand in their developrrental prob-
lems,  above all,  to make sure that the special achievements
 
of each group find avenues for continued dynamic growth,
 
both as a contribution to planetary culture and as a core
 
of morale-giving life-style for the descendants of that group.
 
Here we put the culture concept to work for the future of
 
mankind.
 
-2-  LOMAX
 
All humans need grandparents and ancestors whom they
 
can respect; our first job is to make sure this essential
 
need is met.  This means that we must turn our specialized
 
knowledge around and put it at the service of the people from
 
whom we derive the information for our field reports and books.
 
They need documents,  libraries,  tape archives,  film deposi-
tories,  schools to reinforce their own great and small tra-
ditions,  just as we have needed a huge complex of scholarly
 
and educational institutions to feedDack and reinforce our
 
western civilization in the Euro-American zone.  The quin-
tessence of this "civilizing" feedback system has been a high
 
standard of critical values,  essential to the maintenance of
 
quality,  authenticity, harmony and truth in our high culture.
 
Here we can make an important input; our training as critical
 
observers and conservators gives us a nose for the fake and
 
a keen sense of the genuine and the authentic.
 These insights,
 
which arise from our training as comparative scholars, can
 
be put to the service of small cultures everywhere, because
 
the process of cultural attrition is due as much to the
 
gradual corruption of cultures,  as to their total disappearance.
 
In every case we can uphold the genuine as against the cultur-
ally spurious.
 
Many anthropologists have been made to feel a distaste
 
for activism,  for the very idea of applied anthropology.
 Levi-
Strauss,  for one, has argued persuasively that when the
 
-3- LOMAX
 
anthropologist takes up the cudgels for a culture, he loses
 
his usefulness as an objective scientist.  However,  the new
 
findings of Systems Theory bring such views into question.
 
We now realize that human culture is an enormously complex
 
system of systems (economic, political,  sexual,  nurturant,
 
expressive, communicative, biological, etc 4
 
and of one of. its sub-systems, we must, of necessity, parti-
cipate in system development, whatever  course we take.
 Here,
 
the line between passive and active is meaningless.  However,
 
there remains the all-important distinction between the
 
knowledgeable and involved,  as against the ignorant and un-
involved.  Anthropologists know the importance and the dynamic
 
structure of cultural systems.  They might not be able to do
 
t
ill thoy might wish 
*in order to insure their continued growth,
 
but ovary considered stop they take is likely to be positive
 
rather than negative.
 The high standards of our profession
 
insure that.
 
Since our goal is the maintenance of the widest range
 
of human values in all the present contextaof cultures,  the
 
line between research and action actually disappears,  as it

did for American anthropologists in their participation in the
 
-4- LOMAX
 
fight against Nazism -
 a frank enemy of human variety.
 
Now we face another threat to the human cultural future
 
located at the very center of our society -
-
 the advertizers,
 
the merchandizers,  the administrators of centralized enter-
tainment and communication,  the administrators of centralized
 
education and the captains of the multi-nationals and of in-
dustrializing nations.  Here, as teachers,  as molders of pub-
lic opinion and as the knowledgeable experts in the field of
 
culture, we can oppose tendencies which lower the quality of
 
life  with our professional concern for the genuine and authen-
tic in culture  as opposed to the fake and the spurious.  We
 
function not as economists or social workers, but as aesthetic
 
engineers, concerned with the transmission of culture's core values,
 
with its informational and expressive communication systems,
 
in a word, with feedback.
 
One essential direction must concern the twin problem
  
of the destruction of tribal people and their removal from
  
traditional land. This is a continuing and horrifying aspect
 
of life in the 20th century,  and a very unpopular cause:
 the
 
general public seems
 happy to hear that the "

 Indeed, very few anthropologists have intervened
 
here,  i

p i
t e
 o
f
 t
h
e
 fact that they owe their careers and much
 
of their personal distinction to the people who have generously
 
and hospitably entertained and educated them in the field.
 Now
 
that such field work - is sharply reduced ,
 there is certainly less
 
reason for our profession not to become engaged as friends of
 
-5-  LONAX
 
the oppressed and neglected small cultures of the planet.
 
Here a program of research and advocacy may be combined.
 
1
)
 The Black Book of Culture -
 Our profession should
 
propose a large-scale and detailed account of the destruction
 
and removal of cultures during the last two centuries -
-
 es-
pecially in recent years -
-
 a report,  like a roll-call of
 
humanity,  that will put the whole story before the human tri-
bunal in the clearest terms.
 
2
)
 The state of all presentlY threatened cultures must
  
be reported on and, where suitable, made part of public and
 
administrative concern.  Here,  field anthropology must now
 
become a continuing report on the present situation of all
 
tribal and folk culture.
 
3
)
 A series of world conferences must be called to
  
assess the situation of threatened cultures and a policy must
 
be developed to meet the threat of the disappearance of cultural
 
variety.
 
4
)
 The cases of the most threatef
lend cultures must
  
be brought to the attention of the administrators concerned,
 
together with suggested solutions and, where necessary, each
 
of these problems must be brought into the public forum and
 
fought through, backed by the unity of our profession and a
 
humanistic concern for justice.
 Our professional knowledge
 
will lend great weight to our defense of the rights of the
 
tribes to life,  to culture,  and to their land.
 
-6-
 LOMAX
 
However, because ours is a scholarly,  literary, essen-
tially aesthetic profession, we are best prepared to work in the
 
neglected but important areas of communication,  education and the
 
arts.
 
5
)
 Feedback of the fruits of anthropological research must
 
be made suitably available in tribal cultures and sub-cultures and
 
through the media which are most effective--tape, photographs,  films
 
and handbooks.  This will involve continuing and practical research
 
into the structure of human communication systems-and a large,
 
specialized writing job.
 
6
)
 Multi-cultural education systems.
 
Every culture
 
needs classroom time in its own locality and region  -
-
 where
 
its language,  customs and arts are taught.  Here the bards,
 
the artists,  the wisemen,  the musicians,  the orators,  the
 
elders of the culture can function as teachers -
-
 to give
 
every young person a firm basis in his own tradition,  as he
 
learns to read,  to figure and to acquire global and scien-
tific information.
 Such parallel systems of education are now
 
needed everywhere,  including ,o ur  own country; but they will
 
not develop maturely without the guidance and active partici-
pation of anthropologists,  linguists and ethnomusicolOgiSt5.
 
Bi- or tn -lingual educational programs are very feasible,
 
if they are introduced early in childhood.  We must also ad-
vocate the general teaching of the international phonetic
 
system,  so that one of the educational activities in every
 
school,  engaging both teachers and pupils, could consist in
 
recording the oral traditions of the world in written form.
 
-7-  LOMAX
 
In this way,  standards and methods of anthropology might become
 
a part of the intellectual and social equipment of all human
 
beings,  since all would have participated, to one degree or
 
another,  in the task of documenting and evaluating some as-
pects of their own cultural heritage.
 
7
)  Multi-channeled, multi-directional communication
  
systems must be substituted for the single-channeled uni-
directional systems that now funnel information out from a
 
central point into the peripheries of nations.  These uni-
directional, centralized systems are swiftly becoming so
 
large that they control culture,  rather than the other way
 
round.  The recent entrance of the mafia into the global
 
entertainment industry is bringing about a further lowering
 
of standards -
-
 in film,  in TV,  in popular song,  in magazines.
 
Local,  regional,  ethnic,  special-group broadcasting,  recording
 
and publishing offer the ultimate answer to theSe problems,
 
for here the community acts as brake on excesses of every
 
kind.
 The anthropologists and his folklore colleagues can
 
know their human environments better than anyone else; they
 
can carry out cultural demographieS and creatively assess
 
the tastes and the needs of local groups in relation to their
 
inherited lifestyles.  As researchers, program advisors,  and
 
program makers in the regions where they live and work,  they
 
can have a tremendous long-term effect on broadcasting content,
 
_8_LOMAX
 
by developing and supporting feedback of local cultures
 
over the media'
 
TV,  film radio and records -
-
 the quick media -
-
are rapidly usurping most of the feedback functions once per-
formed by local creators and their audiences.
 The result is
 
that life in localities is losing its savor.
 The anthropologist
 
can have his most profound effect here -
-
 by redirecting the
 
media so that every local culture gets its due share of airtime,
 
thus providing feedback for local and regional culture patterns.
 
The most vital forces and the most effective carriers of local
 
cultures must be located and supported; various indigenous
 
models must be tried out and adjusted; the effect of broad-
casting policy must be evaluated and revised  in a continuing
 
collaboration between the anthropologist,  the local culture
 
and the media.
 Here again,  the anthropologist must play
 
multiple roles -
-
 as researcher, critic, mediator,  cultural
 
diplomat.
 
9
)
 Ethnographic Film. Videotape and portable sync-
sound movie cameras make it possible to film at length anywhere
 
on earth.  No other form of data-gathering can compare with an
 
extended film recrod of human events.
 The profession must ad-
vocate and carry out a number of large-scale projects:
 
a
)
 To film,  in depth,  a sample of the sixty to eighty
 
main types of human culture still extant.
 Each of these films
 
-
 8A-
 LOMAX
 
would be a total ethnography, done in detail in accordance
 
with a pre-formulated ethnographic plan that would make most
 
aspects of each film record comparable.  This must be an inte-
grated effort,  and it will cost millions of dollars--but if
 
our profession actively supports it as it has done in a number
 
of paper resolutions,  the funds will certainly become available.
 
All these filmed ethnographies must be the cooperative work of
 
filmmakers and ethnographers.  The footage will be a vast store-
house of information for a generation of researchers in human
 
behavior, on the one hand; and on the other,  it will be a
 
record of culture essential to its members and their descendants.
 
b
)
 To film threatened cultures and institutions --
here  I am in support of the plans of others reporting to this
 
panel.  To what they nave said,  I add this suggestion--that
 
that technically good documents of culture can now be made all
 
over the world, with the aid of local TV crews,  if the anthro-
pologist$ will take the responsibility of selling the projects
 
and then supervisir
iy them,  to make sure that serious cultural
 
values are realized.
 
c
)
 The film as feedback. The work of Kammerling
 
in Alaska,  and others,  provides convincing evidence that when
 
ethnographic filmmakers work in collaboration with culture
 
members,  they provide the most powerful support for culture
 
itself.  As Rouch says,  film is one of the things that the
 
ethnographer can give back to his friends in the field.
 
-9- LOMAX
 
Cheap, portable film and tape equipment make this kind of
 
research and research-cum-cultural feedback a viable process
 
for the future of anthropology.
 
c
i
)
 Orqanizinq Ethnoqraphic Filminq. 
Both urgent
 
filming and the creation of a world filmed ethnography would
 
have more fruitful outcomes if they were part of a concerted
 
international effort where costs and responsibilities could
 
be shared.
 At present, considering the urgency of the task
 
of recording mankind's life styles and the paucity of funds,
 
there is wasteful overlapping of effort that should be eliminated.
 
We need one or two international coordinators to keep all the
 
projects in contact and in some sort of sync,  to help maintain
 
standards and goals,  and to act as fund-raisers.
 
e
)
 Preservation and study of visual records.
 
The Smithsonian Film Center and other national archives are
 
looking after the most important treasures of ethnographic
 
film but there is a vast amount of footage which national
 
archives cannot possibly house and more is accumulating every
 
day in TV stations.  The visual anthropologists of every region
 
should be concerned about the preservation, care, documentation
 
and study of this material.
 It's life can be vastly prolonged
 
by keeping it in standard optimum conditions even though
 
specialized storage is not available.  Above all,  it needs to
 
be documented and studied.
 Its use in regional, cultural
 
feedback systems is, of course, obvious.
 
-10 - LOMAX
 
f
)
 Film Analysis. This line of study, begun in
 
America by mead and Birdwhistell, has lately languished for want
 
of serious support from our discipline.  The work itself is
 
arduous and the training long; most students have taken short-
cuts and the field is thus in decline.
 Our profession ought
 
to adopt a supportive program,  for example, by helping set up
 
an institute where Birdwhistell,  Schefflen and others could
 
train new expert observers.
 The research goals of anthropology
 
can certainly never be realized until we understand non-verbal
 
communication,  for it is on this channel,  in all likelihood,
 
that a major part of the information about culture is carried.
 
10.
 Ethnographic Recording. Today we simply assume that
 
everyone uses a tape machine well, but in fact the advent
 
of the cassette has probably lowered the quality of field
 
recordings, because they are now so easy to make.  Metraux,
 
among others, has discovered how sensitive tribals are to
 
high fidelity recordings of their culture.
 Fieldworkers must
 
be trained to produce extended, high fidelity recordings of
 
the audible culture of societies; and we must explore ways of
 
using this powerful material in culture support.  No message
 
of mainstream culture is more potent than the pound of mainstream
 
music coming over the radio and the jukebox.  We can establish
 
countervailing systems by making field tape libraries and bush
 
radio networks to feed back native msuical culture.  Above all,
 
-11 - LOMAX
 
we must study the effects of this process in the field.
 
Here,  conversation,  story, oratory,  drama, ritual, work cries,
 
and environmental sounds must all be taken into account.

 Ethnicity. My reading of the literature in this
 
field and my attendance at its meetings convince me that the
 
majority of its personnel are trying to practice anthropology
 
without training and are operating in the culture field without
 
understanding the culture concept.  Yet Ethnicity is becoming
 
so popular 'a field, because its practitioners do broach the
 
problems of urban minority groups,  that it may overshadow
 
us in our own field.
 
In my view our profession should make a serious commitment
 
to work in the so-called ethnicity field to enrich it with our
 
background knowledge of European and other ethnology.  We should,
 
above all,  send some senior people and students into the field,
 
in order to bring light where there is at present much confusion
 
and, on the part of the communities involved,  an increasing
 
feeling of dissillusionment.
 
12.
 From Community Studies to Community Enqineering.
 
The community or single culture study, one of our classic
 
research models,  should now become concerned with on-going
 
community morale,  especially about the developmental possibilities
 
of Otngle cultures and of their espressive communication systems.
 
Cultural continuities can be maintained in symbolic forms alone,
 
in periods of transition and stress.
 Future studies should,
 
-12 - LOMAX
 
therefore, pay special attention to folkways,  to communication
 
techniques, to expressive styles- to all the community's
 
special resources for satisfaction, cultural reinforcement and
 
creative development--so that the anthropologist may be
 
prepared to foster and support the morale of the community
 
through the media and through various sorts of institutions.
 
Here one thinks of the revival of carnival in Trinidad, which
 
due to the help of anthropologists resumed its place as the
 
main focus of community life.  Today every community has such
 
problems and knowledge in depth and informed cultural diplomacy
 
such as the best anthropologists can provide are required for
 
their solution.
 
In a world concerned about the quality of life, one
 
might envisage culturologists as an essential part of the
 
growth facility of every human community.  At present,  it
 
seems to me, our basic training and concern v
iell equips us
 
for taking up these roles and beginning these investigations,
 
but a combination of diffidence and snobbery prevent us from
 
taking a hand.  That we have not done so, when a threatening
 
situation clearly beacons to us, may explain the declining
 
morale in our still young profession.  We need to enter the
 
next stage of the development of our profession, which
 
to become advocates and shapers of human culture.
 In the
 
-13 - LONAX
 
midst of these difficult tasks, we will not only forget our
 
fears, we will,  as scientists, have an opportunity to test
 
our hypotheses in practice.

13.  Cultural Demoqraphy. 
In opposition to the stan-
dardized and unfruitful half-truths of the rating systems and
 
the marketing surveys,  the anthropologist must present his
 
richer view of the demography of culture.
 There the advertizer
 
sees a region as one market to be hit with one slogan, we see
 
it as a pattern of diverse neighborhoods and cultural traditions,
 
each with quite different tastes and interests,  at present
 
unperceived and thus largely neglected.  The need is to
 
develops quick and reliable techniques of cultural demography
 
that can assess the multi-cultural layout of communities
 
and regions and their directions of growth.
 
In a modest way this is what I have been trying do
 
in developing the Cantometric, Choreometric,  and Parlametric
 
systems for cross-cultural analysis of performance style.
 
They have resulted in usable world regional and areal taxonomies
 
of style pattern; with some further work they could be made
 
operable at the community level and in urban settings.
 Today,
 
movement,  song,  and conversation pattern, quickly assessed and
 
quantified, can provide reliable locators of zones of cultural
 
preference.  A teaching system for Cantometrics exists,  so
 
that others may try it out.
 I plan to develop similar measures
 
-14--  LOMAX
 
for visual symbols and for story.
 The aim is to have a
 
way of locating the boundaries of style traditions and
 
of defining them so that anthropologists may employ the
 
dynamics of systems in their defense of culture and in the
 
development of cultural pluralism and of a multi-civilization.

Dear Dr. Feintuch.
 March 23, 1980.
 
Forgive me for not responding sooner. It;  been a period of
 
a lot of illness here in the east and one had energy only to keep up
 
with the essentials of daily work and living.
 
I have a radical suggestion, but one which would yield rich rewards.

the artists and communities
 
which folklore (
the classic traditions) are still alive and might
 
be ehcouraged to flouish.
 
The new groundswell in antgropology, folklore and the humanities
 
is concern about the RETURN of tapes, photographs, informatio )of all sorts to
 
its soiirces 
--- 
the tribes and villages of the planet from which our centers
 
of learning have enriched th
.&jnselves. I myself am working on a plan to send
 
ethnomusicologists al over the world to return the tapes and films we have
 
made in various thrird world countries, to set- up rec rding and filming centers
 
and then to work with all sorts of media amd living event modes to feedback
 
the collectanea to th  cultures from whici
.- it came, in order to give them

at'wil,, enable them to face the

of the artists and communities most concerned.  This, by the way, was the way
 
that the Kennedys operated in Britain----the result is that the oldest
 
folk rites in Britain are all still flourishing.  Our folklore trafition, stemming
 
from German scholarship, has P

our na g

There is an old Finnish saying ---He who scorns the people will wither
 
like a rootless tree---and that applies to folklorists, and centers that go about
 
things in the wrong way.

chic
 
gallimaufry of good things from everywhere  -
 this  fantactic
 
Americana wingding -
 was not shared as widely as possible,
 
using every media technique to make it come alive at the
 
far ends of our country as  it happens,  and to keec it
 
echoing after the event as  long as  possible.
 
One of the central problems of our culture,  a source of
 
sickness and of anomie in our culture and in all the world,
 
is that everything these days happens at the  center and is
 
broadcast out from the  center to the periphery,  to the  small
 
places.  This makes everyone who  is not from megalopolis a
 
hick by inference;  he  is always  cocking his eye on the tube
 
or his ear on the  speaker to  stay in touch. We have to make
 
culture again grow at the  periphery -
 where  culture has
 
always grown. Now that we have artificially brought  in th
 
whole American periphery to a national festival,  we must
 
show the whole country that our biggest festival was
 
created by the  folk from the periphery. Otherwise  we can do
 
damage with the  festival,  instead of using it to right the
 
imbalance that centralized communication and education
 
systems  continually bring about.
 
We have a national radio network and a national television
 
network. Minimally,  these  should report the whole Festival,
 
as  it happens,  if possible,  day by day.  If a daily report
 
is not  possible,  then it  should be the most important
 
weekly event in the government-financed media in the  summer
'
 
of 1
976. I cannot feel that  it  is reasonable that an event
 
which has cost ten years in oveparation,  in dollars two to
 
five million in oubLic money,  shoo'' benefit only Washington
 
and its visitors.
 
This  is the day when the media dominate
 more  than they
 
should,  but they dominate. By giving our folk culture this
 
platform as  it occurs,  they can do a great good.
 
The Festival can be  fed back to the whole country in other
 
ways.  If the  programs are well-taped and well-filmed,  shows
 
can be packaged for states,  for communities,  for special
 
groups,  for children,  for schools,  for colleges,  that can
 
be fed out into the whole  country,  and abroad as  well,  for
 
months after the Festival  is over.  This aspect of the presen-
tation i,  I believe,  even more  important than the Festival,
 
itself.  Above all,  what  is  desperately
 needed
 are

entertainments of local origin presented over local and regional
 
media.  The Festival will bring together and brilliantly present
 
this  local,  regional,  and ethnic talent.  These presentations
 
must be  captured and programmed for local consumption. Our
 
folk traditions,  our folk artists need recognition in their
 
own localities and regions,  so they can re-start their word
 
and renew the rich variety of American culture.
 
The key element  in this operation is to film the Festival
 
as  it happens -
 onstage,  offstage,  and backstage,  so that
 
all the great performers,  all the great performances are
 
eloquently and sympathetically recorded.  This  is a film job
 
that can be done either by the master cameramen of the great
 
films  (
whom this project could not possibly afford) or by
 
specially trained ethnograohic filmmakers,  used to landing
 
on their feet at the head of the river,  shooting from the
 
hip with a minimum crew,  and sensing the pattern of new cul-
ture as it unfolds before their camera eye.
 
There have been justified complaints  in the past about hoe
 
the Smithsonian Festival and other folk festivals have been
 
shot:  What has been lacking has been the  sensitivity and
 
the expertise that our best ethnographic filmmakers possess.
 
They are used to dealing with people who speak a different
 
kind of body language and who phrase their human interactions
 
if
l a different way than the Euro-American mainstream person
 
does.  If this Festival and its assemblage of important folk
 
artists with patterns of style that represent the very best
 
in the folk tradition can be  filmed by skilled ethnographic
 
filmmakers who understand such patterns,  the result would be a  l
 
sal delight.  America has  some of the greatest of such filmmakers.
 
The  folk and ethnographic filmmaker must know where the action
 
is moving by instinct,  much as the great sports  cameraman does.
 
With modern portable  16 mm cameras and the new synch sound
 
equipment,
 such a
 cameraman can record an event entirely on
 
his own. Many of the musical events,  however,  will have to
 
be covered from two angles
 and there will have to be a bit
 
of lighting.  Thus,  a four man crew is essential.  However,  
 
such four man crew can begin with the rehearsals  in the
 
dormitories on Sunday and Monday,  follow the cycle of choice
 
events as they occur on the mall through Tuesday,  Wednesday,
 
and Thursday,  and, by the end of that time,  have  filmed the
 
choicest things of soc wet
-k at
. the Festiial.
 
There has been a question within the Folklife staff about
 
the difficulty of controlling the  scholarly aspects of the
 
filmed renresentations of the Festival. I believe the

It is perfectly practical to have  the  film developed,  printed,
 
and work-printed as  shot,  so that by Thursday night the  ca n

oraman-director of the week can sit down with the productic
 
staff and pick out the material  for the Sunday afternoon or
 
evening report on the Festival.  There  is no way in the worls
 
that the  four days'  shooting cannot give rise to enough
 
material to produce  a brilliant one hour,  a variety shc
 
with the  feeling of the  feeling of the American patchwork,  yet
 
narrated in such a way as to give maximal understanding to
 
the  social,  cultural,  and historical significance of the

cameraman and producer of the famous film on the African

classics,  "Titticut Follies," a person with an incredible
 
feel for the immediate human situation and an enormous
 
talent for filming  dance and music,  as his many smaller
 
Bushmen films have shown.
 
.
 Robert Young, whose background in ethnographic Filming
 
ranges from black Africa to Morocco,  to the Eskimos, to the
 
United States. His film on the Netsalic is one of the
 
classics and created a storm of enthusiasm when it was
 
presented on CBS.
 
.
 Pierre Gaisseau, the adventurer-explorer-cameraman of
 
"The Sky Above the Mud Below," whose unconventional films on
 
Africa, New Guinea, Vietnam, Japan, New York, South America,
 
and Central America have an unmatched and vivid humanity.
 
5
. Timothy Asch, the author of the nationally famous serb s
 
on the Yanomamo Indians,  the cameraman on the equally
 
important series on Afghanistan, one of the maf
for figures
 
in the ethnographic film world, both as a cameraman and a
 
producer.
 
6
. The sixth filmmaker has not yet been decided upon.  Several
 
names are still under consideration. But I will only take
 
the trouble to finish the casting if there appears to be
 
genuine interest among the funding agencies as well as th
 
Smithsonian in the furtherance of reports to making the
 
Festival come alive.
 
At this point, I can only offer the beginning of
f th
 uf
fget
 
having to do with the filming of the Festival, the creation
 
of a master copy,  of a workprint, of the transfer of all the
 
sound onto 16 mm stock, and the edge numbering of the entire
 
corpus. This is the first and most important step in the
 
plan that I have outlined. The approximate total is
 
OO,OOO. If this group, which we might call American
 
Ethnographic Films, Inc., were, as it perhaps might ccli Ic,
 
employed to produce the footage and co-produce the televis Qn
 
series,  this cost would be within the
 limits
 
of this figure. No budget is submitted for the editing and
 
production stages,  since here the costs  will  vary,  depending
 
on whether this had to be done in an independent studio b
Ig
 
one of the PBS stations. The budget is a sketch, but was
 
worked out in collaboration pith Robeet Gardner,  an expert in

these matters.  The further  staffiny of i
Thts rrodust on mitht
 
be  conceived of in this way:
 
1.  An asoistant  producer,  who should 1J
  emctoyed at as sar ,
 
a date  as possible, both as the coordinating figure,  and
 
the packager and distributer of the various nrcgrarss that
 
will come  out of this cultural operation.
 
2.  An artistic director,  who would work with each of the
 
cameramen during the  summer on the problems of choosing
 
the material,  setting up the  filming,  and supervising the
 
folkloric asnect of the Sunday afternoon programs.  This
 
is the  od e I see  fsr myself in the whole matter.
 
3
. Dun n: the  summer,  If the report series  comes into being,
 
there will need to be a coordinator-producer,  perhaps
 
different from staff member number 1,  who would link the
 
work on the grounds with the producing organization and see
 
to the  processing of all the  film and the actual airinf of
 
the twelve  programs.
 
6
. A production secretary and girl Friday wilt  r

needed.
 
.
 One  liaison person should be delegated in the Smithsonian
 
staff to work with other staff members  in order to make
 
sure of the accuracy of the  script and the  film interpretation
 
of all the material and to help in liaison work with the
 
groups and with their leaders.
 
I think no  larger,  and perhans even a smaller staff world
 
be able to do this  job,
 since
 the production should be
 
handled as  simply and unobtrusively as  possible.  It might
 
very well be that each cameraman-director would come in
 
only with his assistant  cameraman,  and would work with an
 
a lightâ€”_-
- and grips person and a sound man who would be em-
ployed for the duration of the Festival.  This pair,  along
 
with the girl Friday,  and/'or the  assistant producer could
 
certainly handle most of the  working problems that
 
would come up. Here,  I have  sketched the  largest possible
 
staff,  but  it would be great to keep the whole thin, down

I simply wanted to record my sincerity regarding the hope that you
 
can realize the Folk Life documentation/Presentation in the manner
 
we discussed Tuesday in your office.
 
Surely it is an opportunity not to be missed through mis-application
 
of dollars and energy to merely package high gloss TV programming.
 
You should somehow insist that film be used so as to make weekly or
 
biweekly compilations during the summer and then have at hand a body
 
of editable footage for later wide distribution and feedback to sources.
 
I would be delighted to undertake a two week assignment as Director!
 
Cameraman.
 
I think the budget we discussed has validity as long as space and
 
editing facilities are supplied.
 
Have written Dr. Bronte about your application for a publication grant.
 
All best wishes,
 
fondly,

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM ALAN LOMAX SUâ€¢BSEQUENT TO
 
HIS OBSERVATIONS OF THE  '
75 FESTIVAL AND HIS CONTINUING
 
RELATION AS FOLKLORE CONSULTANT
 
Since all my readers are certainly aware of my belief in
 
the festival, which I believe is the best thing of its kind,
 
they will forgive me if I confine myself to recommendations
 
for aposk
ijF
, improvements.
 
The big social and cultural problem for which the Festival
 
can provide the remedy. is the serious cultural loss which
 
I
s
 
affect
 the lives of Americans,  certainly causing social
 
and psychological maladjustments, and tz threaten
 the
 
whole of world culture. This threat comes from the control of
 
all the main cultural channels -
 public communications systems
 
and education -
 by two
, dominant systems of culture which do
 
not realize that they have cultural forms, and that these
 
cultural forms,  if they are too frequently displayed,  can
 
kill, off all the others. Almost everyone growing up in the
 
United States has experienced the pain and humiliation in public
 
school and in college in learning that his culture was not
 
"
f
ture." The Smithsonian Festival declares the opposite to
 
be true, that all the cultural traditions in this country are
 
excellent and worthy of continuance.
 
Our obligation,  in consequence,  is clear. Since we have
 
little time, and since the presentation of these diverse cultural
 
events occurs with the imprimatur  of the national government
 
in a patriotic setting, the presentations must be of themselves
 
of the highest order of excellence. Contemporary communications
 
theory teaches us that the principle function of the lively
 
arts is to reinforce the main identification systems within
 
a cultural tradition, making the people feel at home with
 
themselves and linking them to their parents. This is a
 
dynamic tendency, but it is also conservative. I believe,
 
therefore,  that we should adopt a somewhat conservative stance.
 
The success of the humanists, scholars, and critics who
 
have made Western European civilization into a permanent
 
world force, was critically conservative,--that is, they chose
 
the best models for presentation. They put. them forth in the
 
best possible setting,  in the most authentic and carefully
 
eidted editions and exhibitions, and they transmitted their
 
critical appreciation of these masterpieces to the whole world.
 
This is our task as folklorists.
 
There is a tendency in contemporary folklore and anthropology
 
to feel that Vf
t evanescent fad cultures, many of which owe
 
their origin to the influence of the advertising media,  should
 
have an equal and uncritical presentation alongside of the
 
older aspects of tradition. I strongly take issue with this,
 
since this urban lore has not yet been critically evaluated,
 
its authenticity has not been vouched for, and its importance
 
to the people, themselves,  has not been attested by the only
 
test we know for art, up till now,  time. It seems to me that

gets a hearing
 aTis losing out
 
against the pressure of advertising is the root stuff. I
 
think,  from what I read, these roots are being torn up and
 
thrown away in America and in the whole world with a simply
 
incredible energy. In 1976, the Festival should look at the
 
roots and the trunks of the American tradition, and -
i
rr jlrt--
leave some of the branches out. Our first message is the
 
variety, the health, the solidity, the dynamism of the
 
traditions that opened up the country and gave it a whole
 
series of civilizations,  from the cultures of the American
 
Indian to the cultures that opened up the West and, most
 
recently, the middle South.
 
I feel very strongly that the Festival has been poorly
 
staffed, in the sense that many of the people who have been
 
choosing the participants and designing the Festival did not
 
have a sufficient grounding and experience in folklore to
 
make the wisest choices.
 
Folklore,  in its field sense,  is
 
still considerably more of an art than a science; and it takes
 
a long while to ripen a harvest. This is not to say that there
 
are not some ripened young folklorists, but I think that the
 
guidance of the best field musicologists,  field anthropologists,
 
and field folklorists should be continually sought in the
 
construction of this particular and crucial  '
76 Festival.
 
I know that this tendency has already begun, but it cannÃ t
 
be pursued with enough ardor. This is the turning point for
 
the folklore movement in America. If the  '
76 Festival is the
 
,
6
 L
rb
 
brilliant presentation which the -
4
' 
 
 
 mil1io Ã§
Tlars
 - 
can make it, the folklore movement will have
 
mounted a plateau and can move forward toward new successes.
 
If the Festival is mediocre, and there are many signs from
 
1975 that it might well be,  the whole movement will suffer
 
damage Tor years to come.
 
A1 hough there were many things about the  '
75 Festival that
 
were fine and rewarding, my overall impression was that the
 
basic Smithsonian staff was tired, bored, and that the Festival
 
I
'
 
itself was,  in many respects,  rather mediocre. One sign of
 
this was that on stage after stage the miking was
 badly
 
done. No one who has put on a concert, and all the staff
 
members have put o
ra concerts,  could fail to know how to do
 
reasonable miking. But I saw no great effort expended in this
 
direction.
 
As a part-time presenter, I often as
aff members for
 
extra things, which would have helped people who were struggling
 
to reach their audiences across cultural barriers.  and I was
 
universally put off with '
comments that this . sn't my job,
 
this is the sort of thing we never do, and so on. A lot of the
 
staff were simply wandering around the grounds in a state of
 
shock, apparently bewildered by weariness and by what they had
 
wrought. The period of the presentation, however,  is the time
 
when the staff should be at its peak. Nothing is too much to
 
be done,  it seems to me,  for the performers and
 audience
 
when that particular situation has been set up. Every person in
 
theatre knows and feels this, and somewhoW the Smithsonian staff
 
must be animated with this kind of spirit for, next year.
 
In particular, there need to be people making certain
 
that the miking is correct. This will involve two stages:
 
a rehearsal with each group in the auditorium before they
 
make their presentation,  so that they themselves can handle
 
the miking, and making sure that the people who are handling
 
the control boards understand their controls and know how
 
to use them and are possibly on the qui vive. Those who
 
are not should be simply kicked off the staff on the spot
 
if they are caught not concentrating on their task. There
 
should be one or two technical supervisors, who are
 
experienced in field recording, to control the whole
 
Festival in relationship to its sound presentation.
 
On the whole,  those parts of the Festival   
 
effectively presented by people who knew something about
 
,
 A--
the lore and who made sure that the audience knew what they
 
were hearing were successful presentations. Those 
,,
where
 
there was no explanation and the performers were left to
 
fend for themselves were not so successful. I think it is
 
completely absurd and sentimental to suppose that
 
coming from an office with his family can suddensly catch
 
the spirit of
 music and &eif
i  peopl
m
r u) th-
These people and their music must be carefully presented
 
with thoughtfully prepared introductions.
 
It seems to me that the ideal solution for all the problems
 
thus far mentioned is to have one person with two devoted
 
assistants -
 one experienced folklorist, anthropologist or
 
amateur related to each of the main segments of the Festival.
 
This person should be basically in charge of the field work,
 
the selection,  the arrangements for transport,  the comfort,
 
the presentation planning, the miking, the tour of the
 
people in his segment. It is a big, but unitary,.job, and
 
I am absolutely confident that if there were ten or fifteen
 
such really first-rate,  competent field-folklorist presenters
 
on the grounds per week, half of the problems of the
 
Festival would disappear. The excellence of performance
 
would be unquestioned, their identification with the public
 
would be cleared up, and their comfort and self-reali zation
 
would be assured in Washington and on the tour.
 
Where this pertained in the  '
75 Festival, you had
 
excellent shows with good public rapport; where it did not,
 
you did not have such a  ituation
 
There were other asnects of the Festival which seemed to
 
i
nc to mark a decline in staff attention which must be arrested
 
and changed for this great 1976 show. The first of these
 
relates to the decor. What was on view last year were the same
 
tents,  the same signs, and the same shopworn ideas that I have
 
seen in the past. I have some recommendations. The best
 
setting on the grounds was for the Italian show. There you had
 
a formal theatre backdrop made from a local Sicilian image,
 
and the people  looked great against it. I think it ought to be
 
possible for all the cultural events to happen against some
 
similar backdrop of quite formal design, which could be made
 
by your artist and his scene-painting assistants to relate to
 
the presentations of the forty or fifty groups that
 
are coming through town. I think the flat paintings
 
are something

.. Under the direc-
tion of one good design artist,  these flats,  it
 
seems to me,  could be painted and repainted for eight
 
or ten of the various stages, using themes and ele-
ments from the traditional folk designs that are known
 
and available in books,  so that the people will be
 
playing in a stimulating visual setting. We know from
 
study of expressive systems that they all fit together.
 
The true design will match the forms presented in the
 
dance and the song.
 
This brings me to cooking. It seems to me that the
 
great disappointment of the  festival is that the cook-
ing

I cannot see any possible excuse for  
 
commercial hamburgers and spaghetti to this festival. It
 
would be better not to have so much food,  so long as we

had folk food

professionals who know how to manage these matters. We
 
have incredible and talented cooks  in every one of the
 
groups who visit the festival,  who can arran e
 e mas
 
production of the food. It seems to me these two members
 
of th  orchestra can begin to play together, and the
 
festival can become a culinary, as well as a musical,
 
event of the first order. Certainly,  one
, person who really knows
 
this field should' be put entirely in charge of organizing it. It
 
should not be left to some member of the staff who happens to be
 
interested in cooking. This requites a top-flight,  international
 
connousseUr and kitchen manager, maybe two people. r
imt ,
 f you
 
do it, you'll make history;  if you don't, you'll certainly be
 
missing one of the great opportunities that the  festival has.
 
There has been talk about building buildings on the Festival,
 
about bringing great numbers of objects to the Festival,
, but I
 
think that snending money this way is ridiculous when, with
 
paint brushes,  cooking pots, and careful stage managing,
 
cultures can be reconstructed in the eyes, dancing feet, and
 
palates of the audience.
 
One suggestion I strongly urge  is that the  introducers of
 
each of the segments speak with the accent of the people being , 
introduced, especially
 
be a conscious attempt
 
speakers who speak the

invisibLe traits of culture, which should be orchestra ted  to  
match the authenticity of the impact of the other non-verbal
 
one of the
 
patterns that are being presented. Accent and dialect should
 
be made a point of in the presentations. Wherever the singers
 
can talk or tell a story and dance a step,  this should occur.
 
One of the things that is needed, and has not been done at
 
the Festival,  is to work with the  people before and between
 
their presentatipf
ls. Usually, the  people who come to these
 
festivals are multi-talented and can do many things. But
 
side of their
 
they often go away having presented only
 
one
 
multi-faceted personalities. If you have some of your
 
presentation staff begin working with the groups as soon as
 
they arrive, you can help them to enrich their presentations,
 
vary them and bring out people who, because they are a little
 
modest, may be obscured by the front-runners.
 
I do not thi.nk that the staff of the Festival is ready to
 
present whole communities and whole community events. This
 
requires an order of sophistication and good luck and work
 
which is out of the question for most of the events at the
 
Festival. In some cases where the Festival forms are such
 
things as weddings, or tradit ional ways of worship or work,
 
such events can he, to sonic extent, replicated on the Festival
 
grounds and rehearsed beforehand for successful presentation.
 
P
iost such attempts, hoviever, are going to fall on their face
 
because the  p
eople will simply not have the time to get them
 
ready for presentation on the  formal stage,  stepping over mike
 
wires and with an immovable audience staring at them. Thank

If we don't feel that we have to
 
we will avoid attempting to do
 
something in relation to American material which is pretty nearly
 
impossible. The fact is,  in America we have relatively few folk
 
events in whi t
h whole communities are  involved. The rodeo, the
 
charo ring, the baptism -
 truly well-elaborated institutions
 
of this kind are a rarity in America. This is because of our
 
anti-pagan history, and because most of our communities have
 
been in flux since their very inception. The development of
 
forms of interaction that involve whole communities takes a
 
very l
ong time. I therefore am absolutely solidly opposed to
 
putting on the sorts of mocked-up street fairs that minority
 
groups have established in our cities and most of the rather
 
inconsequential and silly events which go very well at country
 
picnics, but actually aren't worth staging, unless you have
 
a master stage manager. The fact i

1 cannot see anything wrong, with a whole series' of
 
solo performers. These people are the real entertainers in the
 
c

should not try to present anything else. There are..a few big
 
and v
zonderful things,  like the Sacred Harp singing conventions.
 
Here we should soertd extra money. But,  for Heaven's sake,
 
l
et's not try to match the world with rituals when we have so
 
few that are really very rich and interesting. We do have an
 
incredibly varied and exciting group of musical and dance forms,
 
and these we should try to bring out.
 
One of the big failures of the Festival has been in its Ã§
f
 
present
.
 of the American dance tradition, whtch has fas-
cinated the world. Most of our dances had folk roots. Most
 
of them can still be recon truCted. I think the th ng that
 
should be worked on is
 
U.S., especially black
 
that we're going to be
 
to show all the dance styles of the
 
dancing and that part of Latin America
 
able ta include. A special effort
 
should be made to get dancers in every group. The Mexican
 
couple last year was an outstanding feature. The Italians, who
 
had a couole of good dancers and many enthusiasts, built up a
 
big head of steam with their audience. But all field workers
 
should think carefully about dance.
 
In relation to dance, i continually find the black diaspora
 
presentations extremely disappointing. It's. as if the people
 
in charge were limiting us,  the audience, to the things that
 
they themselves,
 approve of and l
eaving out all the rest of it.
 
Wc don't have the dancers, we don't have the hollers, we don't
 
have the
, work songs, we don't have the choral spirituals, we
 
don't have the folk tales, we don't have the street corner
 
conversations,, we don't have the genuine rituals. When you get
 
through saying all that, what we don't have is the greatest of
 
all American  musical. traditions, which is the Afro-American
 
creation here. Instead of splendor, we have some bits and
 
pieces. Instead of a program which reaches out and involves
 
the audience in a spirit of passionate joy and outbursts of
 
great emotion, both tragic and life-giving, we have a rather
 
timid and in-turned overall presentation. It's as if the blacks
 
A
 
had their backs to us, and that's not African culture. African
 
culture  is outgoing and grou
p_involving. There seems to be a
 
wall of censorship here which must be broken down.
 
It's notorious that,  in many black communities, there's a
 
deep feeling of shame attached to the ways of parents and
 
randParef

and social tension now between blacks and whites  is no possible

to land in all kinds of silly and time-wasting politics. If
 
yo u  go directly as a folklorist and with friends already on
 
the  island, you will have absolutely no problem in getting
 
the best material on a plane and into Washington. I can
 
tell you how to do most of that. But it's ridiculous that
 
the West Indian material that we've so far had, except with
 
the

ragtag and bobtail.
 
By the way, I thought that some of the African segments
 
of the Festival were superb and extremely beautiful. Even so,

I come finally to the American Indian presentation. As I
 
understand it, there has been a decision for political reasons
 
to work through the most viable tribal organizations in ar-
ranging the presentations. May I say that if the Smithsof
ll,an
 
were doing an exhibit of Indian crafts,  the wouldn't work
 
this way. They would go to the best informants and the best
 
exoerts and build up a show. I can't see for the  life of me
 
why this can't be continued, despite the fact that there have
 
been some  problems between the Department of the Interior and
 
Indians on oolitical grounds. There is a whole generation of
 
anthropological field workers who have an enormous rapport
 
right this minute with Indians, political or non-political.
 
These people are known. All you have to do is call Bill St
e
 
-
drV
-and some other anthropologists to get a group of working
 
advisors, and it seems to me they can make sure that whatever
 
co me s  t o  the Smithsonian is, agin, of the very highest calibre.
 
A
 
I loved the Iroquois show last summer, but, once the people
 
had stopped singing and dancing, there was nothing else to
 
it. The people who were presenting traditions were talking
 
mostly out of half-informed ignorance. The
 s were
 
ex 
poor. The Indian food, which is magnificent, was
 
not served. There was no feeling of continuity. The Plains
 
material was simply dreadful.
 
Here, again, we're allowing some kind of middle class
 
culture conflict to get in the way of what is essentially a
 
scientific matter and a matter of insoired showmanship. You
 
have
 million to spend, and the backing of Congress and of
 
the whole United States to present American culture and its
 
roots. It is inexcusable that you l
et yourself get into a
 
political box where a few people who do not have very much
 
influence, but whose opinions may wear heavily within your
 
own organization and have been allowed to cut down on the
 
projection of the antique and beautiful
, models of Indian
 
life style in the Smithsonian setting. In the past I've seen
 
sone beautiful things -
 the Lu tteS, the Pomos, and others.
 
But next year, the while world and America should vibrate to
 
the  incredible splendors and glories of Indian culture,  culture
 
that i
s still alive and still developing.
 
Here you can get,  it seems to me, great help from Mexico.

make an everlasting statement about the everlasting culture of
 
the American Indians. It should be the best thing in the Festival.
 
It is certainly the thing that most non -
-Americans would cross
 
the ocean to see.
 
The talks I've had with staff members about
 leave me
 
absolutely bewildered. They always end up in reference to
 
personalities or to low-level difficulties, but never relate
 
to the
 
actual si ze of the Festival or the cultural dimensions
 
which the Festival and its  i
rnpressarioS have obligated them-
selves,  publicly,  to deliver. I feel,  frankly, very much
 
inclined to go to the Secretary or even to the public with
 
my complaint about this matter. American Indian is known. All
 
sorts of devoted scholard have snent their lives studying it.
 
Every good carrier of culture  is someone who is a known per-
sonality, and there are many many Americans, red,  white, and
 
purple, who know how to handle the really rather low-level
 
problems that are standing in your way. If you don't have
 
these people helping yo u,  well, you're not doing your jobs,
 
and I think that 6Dniebody else ought to be doing them.
 
The end of this memo is
. quarrelsome, but I am convinced that
 
what we '
ye been able to do with Old Ways in the New World
 
should be guidance  for the reforms that can now be made with the
 
t r
ne and money you have at your disposal in the other three
 
big sectors of the Festival.
 
I want to come to one  last point. I feel that  It is absolutely
 
wrong, morally and aesthetically and politically,  for the
 
Festival to be in any way identified as an event paid for by a
 
commercial corporation. The
 b
4t'C
 of General Foods and
 
American Airlines should not go up again. There's no reason
 
that  they shouldn't get a credit on the program, and a nice
 
credit. But their particular commercial image should be set
 
up on the Festival grounds and be attached to its tours and
 
its art extensions  is, I think,  in the very worst of taste,
 
and is li
robably illegal.
 It's caused trouble already in
 
England, and I think it should cause more trouble  if it's
 
not stopped. When you start in that direction, you get the
 
J)  O R
Lk A
 
disaster you had in your glass bubble  0
 last summer,
 
witi big pieces of the material culture of trucking companies
 
of American Airlines occupying more space altogether than
 
any other aspect of American traditional culture. Here,
 
again, you were  imposed on because you are,  it seems to me,
 
simply very nice guys. Here,  it seems to me, you should be-
come ferocious impressarion,  like the people who run the Met
 
and Lincoln Center,  perfectly capable of throwing anyone out
 
of your offices and downstairs who proposes that you do any-
thing that violateS the sacred purpone of your Festival and
 
W
)  is willing to impose upon you anything less than the best,
 
finest, and most authentic of that tradition.
 
There must be no compromises. In cultural things,  there
 
simply cannot be. Life,  itself,  is full of them; but the pro-
fessional must live and behave and present according to the
 
critical standards. Otherwise,  the whole thing goes down the
 
river,  joining the stream of dreck that the advertisers and
 
television are trying to impose on the planet. Let's hold the
 
line. If we do, we'll J
