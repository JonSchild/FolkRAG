Introductions 
0.00.35 
From east central part of the state. Lived there for high school. Went to UW-
Platteville for undergraduate. Anticipated being pre-med. But changed to 
nursing—“which had always been a passion”—due to not wanting to be in school 
too long. “But I ended up in school for 17 years anyway after the fact!” 
0.01.23 
On early interest in nursing: “Yes, I can [remember developing the interest]. I 
actually have a picture of myself for Hallowe’en, maybe in first or second grade, 
as a nurse. And the joke in my family was that I was always the one who took 
care of my grandma, who had pretty bad diabetes, and she always had struggles 
with her feet. And so, I would wash her feet and dry her feet, and just helped to 
take care of her. And that was just always something I was interested in doing, 
and just something I always took with me.” 
0.02.03 
On psychiatric nursing interest: “That actually was one of the areas that was kind 
of feared. You know, you just didn’t know that much about it. I had always 
wanted to be a baby nurse. I found out after my rotation that that was just as 
terrifying. I decided after an ER rotation that I really liked the ER—and actually I 
still work in an ER to this day.” Has worked in an ER for past 17 years. 
0.02.48 
Loved the variation of the ER. “I don’t want to say monotony because nursing is 
not monotony, but there was not that expectation of what your day is going to 
look like every day. It was constantly different. You never knew.” 
0.03.12 
UW-Platteville doesn’t have nursing program. Original plan was to get general 
bachelor’s degree in science of some sort. Ended up with a focus in psychology. 
Waitlist for nursing program could be 3-5 years long. Had transferred to Oshkosh, 
hoping to get into nursing program, but again a long waitlist. Later, transferred 
back to Southwest Technical College, and learned that had been accepted to 
program there.  
0.04.18 
At Southwest Tech, took an Associate’s degree in nursing. Still take same Boards 
and are licensed as registered nurse, and licensed as a nurse, but don’t yet have a 
bachelor’s in nursing. 
0.04.39 
On nursing school: “I felt I had always been a really good student. It hadn’t been 
a struggle for me. Obviously, I still had to do my readings and study and I do 
Page 2 of 9 
 
what I needed to do. But school had come pretty easy to me. But then I started 
nursing school, and I was in my first semester and I almost failed out of my 
med/surg class, which would have then kicked me out of the program. And it was 
really a wake-up call of ‘I really need to focus and be on top of the tasks and 
really dedicate myself to finish my courses so that I could be a nurse, because 
that’s what I really wanted to do.” 
0.05.33 
Med/surg is a general nursing course. 
0.05.48 
Worked while went to school, at UW hospital, as a telemetry tech; did this for 
entire school career. “It was a really good weekend job, earning a little extra 
money but also just being embedded in a medical facility and seeing how that 
worked.” 
0.06.19 
Associate’s degree supposed to be a two-year degree. “But quite honestly it takes 
longer than two years to finish it. By the time you get all your prereqs in, the 
actual nursing courses take two years.” 
0.06.42 
After this, did both more academic studies and worked. “I knew I wasn’t going to 
stop with being an RN. Not that that would have been a bad thing in any way 
whatsoever. That’s a very good career. But I knew I wanted to do more.” Had 
decided that did not want to work in traditional facility, with a regular schedule. 
Took a job as a “kid nurse.”  
0.07.26 
This position had two camps. One, a respite camp, was a camp for people whose 
children have severe mental or physical disabilities, requiring 24/7 care always. 
The respite program provides opportunity to drop off loved one, with the usual 
camp experience, while the caregiver has a break. There’s also a Wawbeek  
program, designed for people with more abilities, able to function relatively 
independently, but requiring some extra support—e.g., help with bathing or 
toileting. Again, the camp gives these people a traditional experience, but with 
people caring for them. 
0.09.11 
On this first job: “I had graduated from nursing school with my mom giving me 
the pressure of ‘Get a job’. The difficulty was I didn’t want to work in a 
traditional setting. I knew I was entering my career, 30-50 years of work. But I 
want to do something fun that somewhere and that’s why I found that camp—I 
love the outdoors. And that time there was a nursing excess, and RN jobs were 
very competitive.” 
0.10.04 
On first impressions of nursing career: “It was definitely not by the book. That 
summer, I was placed at the respite camp. There were two other graduate nurses 
who were working at the Wawbeek camp. And even though it was on the same 
property, it wasn’t like I could just walk down the hall and go collaborate with 
them. And so, I was placed in the care of these 20 campers, who have G-tubes , 
multiple medicate seizures, a variety of disabilities, some of them are non-verbal, 
some have no ability to share what’s going on with them. So, you have to use 
nursing assessments, and figure out how you’re going to do it, and just make it 
work.”  
0.11.14 
“The first day that I had a med error. I went into that summer thinking I’m an 
organized person, I can keep it together. But I had a camper who was getting a 
medication that was considered somewhat off-label. They were getting it ordered 
in from Canada. It was very expensive. The mom had shared that they were 
Page 3 of 9 
 
paying $1200 a month to get this medicine so that her son could have treatment 
for his seizures. And the way it works is you have a blue sheet and that blue sheet 
is essentially our order sheet that the parent fills out. I go through the blue sheet 
with the parent, verifying that everything is correct, and signed off on it. 
Unfortunately, she had written to give the patient two tablets instead of one. So, at 
the end of the week, they didn’t have enough medicine.” The mother was angry. 
“It was just this devastating realization that I was just human … And it caused a 
significant problem for the patient, in trying to get more medicine, trying to pay 
for it. It changed my whole perspective for the rest of the summer. I no longer 
took for granted that just because it was written down, that’s what it was. We 
double and triple checked and now I looked at the bottles too.” 
0.13.10 
After summer, took job working in surgery at Fort Atkinson working in surgery, a 
field had never worked in before, while also starting BSN program. This was 
working in a bigger hospital. 
0.14.12 
Had never considered surgery as a job option, so “that in and of itself was 
terrifying, and then each individual surgeon had his/her own process, their own 
way of counting. So, it wasn’t so much learning how to do the job; it was learning 
to read the surgeon, and knowing what they wanted or expected, so I could always 
anticipate ahead of time what was to come next.” 
0.14.53 
“[That skill] was definitely something that developed over time. I can tell you that 
I started that job in September, and then the first time I felt truly comfortable was 
in April. That was when I did my first solo surgery without anything missing or 
anything that was overlooked. And it was just this amazing day of ‘I got it! I 
figured it out!’” 
0.15.32 
On mentoring: “There was always a nurse that was with me for the first four 
months. But it was always the techs—the surgical techs that were with you. They 
were almost like frontline and could whisper under their breath … You really had 
to be on your toes and just continue to watch. Especially if I had to go [from one 
kind of surgery to the other], every single one of them was completely different.” 
Also had to have several surgeries in one day—starting at 7am and running until 3 
or 4pm. 
0.16.31 
A typical day at this hospital: “In surgery, typically we would get there and be 
assigned to our room, and so we would be with a particular service for the entire 
day, which was nice. And then you would find out who your tech was, and meet 
your patient who was in pre-op, and sometimes you would have to start an IV. 
And you would meet with your anesthetist and find out if you had to do anything 
special. And then counting … And the surgery part was—I hate to say it—boring 
at times. You’re waiting there for something to happen, and you’re always on 
edge anticipating it. But if everything’s going well, you’re in the background, 
taking notes, doing your charting. But then you’re just waiting, waiting for 
something to happen.” 
0.17.50 
“I remember sitting in a surgical procedure that took 4-5 hours, and you don’t 
leave to go the bathroom. You just sit there waiting for something to happen and 
pray that it doesn’t.” 
0.18.21 
On dealing with stress: “It was just getting through it. Getting done with it and 
going home to bed.” Could be many emergency procedures that would delay your 
Page 4 of 9 
 
departure until 1 or 2 am. At that point—with a 1.5-hour commute and having to 
return at 7am—you would ask the house supervisor for an empty room and take a 
nap for a couple of hours. This would depend on whether beds were available; if 
not, you’d find a place to take a nap. 
0.19.33 
Shifts were usually eight hours—7am to 3pm. But the on-call person could have a 
36-hour shift.  
0.19.50 
Worked at this job from September to May. Returned to Easter Seals as summer 
nurse. Felt that might be making a bad decision and would be sensible career-wise 
to keep job. “But I know that Easter Seals had kids that I needed to take care of.” 
Felt that this was a decision out of passion. There is turnover at this job, but not 
because of job quality—the staff is made up typically of college students, most of 
whom are intermittent. 
0.21.14 
Finished BSN in December of ’98, at UW-Madison. Loved the ‘BSN at home’ 
program, or the collaborative nursing program (as it was then). This was 
interviewee’s first experience of ‘online’ coursework; packages were mailed with 
videotapes that students would watch and coursework, and return assignments by 
mail, with occasional meetings with a course group. This was much less intensive 
than coming to campus constantly. Also had a fulltime job at this time and was 
able to do this while taking courses. 
0.23.32 
Worked at Divine Savior in surgery: felt that was “finally comfortable” here and 
had “an awesome group of people that I was working with”. Vividly remembers 
Alison, the manager, who “just was so confident.” “And there is this kind of 
stigma, rumor, bad opinion of orthopedics and how orthopedic surgeons in 
particular can be hard to work with. And I remember her standing up to one of the 
orthopedic surgeons who had a reputation of being difficult to work with. And I 
remember looking at her and thinking ‘Wow! Look at her go.’ She knew what her 
role was—she was advocating for the patient—and she made it happen.” 
0.24.37 
On the tension between nursing and surgeons: “[Encountered this] all the time. 
It’s very real. Very, very real. And I can’t say it’s specific only to orthopedics. 
And I can’t say that it’s across the board either. There have been a number of 
doctors I’ve worked who have been phenomenal—who have been very team-
oriented, very into collaboration. But there is a hierarchy within the surgical 
community. And also, again I have to look at it from the standpoint of ‘We are 
taking care of the patient.’ And so, every time something happened it usually had 
to do with impacting patient care specifically. It is what it is. I personally think 
that there is a different approach to dealing with people: you don’t have to use 
swear words, yell, stomp your feet, and jump all over. And I’ve seen that happen 
twice. And both times just thought, ‘What is wrong with you?’ But then at the 
same time, one time was because I screwed up. I openly acknowledge that I 
screwed up. I had taken an instrument he needed again and put it in the dirty 
bowl, and so it couldn’t be used, and it took thirty minutes to re-sterilize it. And 
that meant half an hour of downtime for the whole ER … I was standing in front 
of the sterilizer because I was too scared to go back in there and hearing what he 
was saying.” 
Page 5 of 9 
 
0.26.31 
On dealing with it: “I took ownership of it and took responsibility, because it was 
my fault.” In other scenarios: “By redirecting towards patient care, because we’re 
there to take care of the patient.” 
0.27.03 
Worked at this job from September 1998 until starting master’s program in 2000. 
Left the job because master’s program required daytime coursework.  
0.27.49 
Master’s at UW-Madison; knew that would go for Adult Health specialty. At that 
time, no psychiatric program (interviewee thinks). Came back to academia 
because of meeting amazing mentor at Easter Seals; felt this reinforced what was 
meant to be. 
0.28.57 
Found this program “very intense, much more rigorous—a lot of coursework and 
clinical work.” Again, realized that there was a gap between previous experience 
and new expectations. Did rural health clinicals, including a 6-8 away-from-
campus clinical during January. Did a six-week rotation at Hayward at a hospital 
and clinic. Did this because of having grown up in a small town and knowing that 
did not want to work in a big city. Felt had seen these people struggle to access 
healthcare—starting with own grandmother—and the delays in accessing care. 
0.31.05 
Felt that had to adapt to what you had in this clinical setting: “you use the 
resources available to you, and you make it work.” 
0.31.48 
Had worked at ER in Baraboo during school time as RNs. Signed on as nurse 
practitioner at that same hospital—a role change. Change from nursing 
assessment and direct patient care, taking orders from doctor (as RN), were now 
in the role of provider, assessing the patient, order tests and treatment and make 
diagnosis (as practitioner). 
0.33.11 
There were six nurse practitioners total in the hospital. Nurse practitioners would 
handle walk-in patients typically—the traditional, common things that could be 
treated easily. 
0.33.53 
On the new role and responsibilities: “Baraboo was wonderful, because one of the 
nurse practitioners there had been one of my preceptors … And she was very 
encouraging and would sometimes come and see ‘You need to look at this, you 
need to see this.’ It was really seamless—she did a phenomenal job.” 
0.34.48 
Graduated from UW-Madison with certification in adult health, so took a one-
semester stint at University of Kentucky to get experience necessary to get 
pediatric certification, and so have family-practice certification. 
0.35.42 
Then took a position at a very rural clinic in Adams, Wisconsin. But the area and 
lack of financial resources meant that interviewee couldn’t be kept on. Decided to 
transition to a more stable job. 
0.36.38 
On the difference between this job: “Holy cow. Surgery in the hospital, once you 
learned the routine, it was the same every single day, unless something happened. 
And I remember turning up at the clinic, thinking I would get used to the routine. 
And I met the manager, who was very nice, and said ‘Your first patient is ready.’ 
And I thought, ‘How is my first patient ready? I don’t know the routine here.’” 
Had to learn on the job the routines of this clinic. Again, had a “phenomenal” 
mentor who—even though only educated to a bachelor’s level—really knew the 
ropes and helped interviewee get up to speed on clinic’s procedures. 
Page 6 of 9 
 
0.38.43 
On the clinic atmosphere: male doctors were paternalistic, but not in way that 
wasn’t supportive or helpful. They had realized atmosphere had changed in 
medicine and they needed female providers to have a larger patient base. 
0.39.46 
On the change from surplus to shortage of nurses: the mid-2000s is when started 
to see a lot of different postings. “There was some animosity among other nurse 
practitioners” when people found they could make more money working in 
specialty as RNs rather than nurse practitioners.  
0.41.11 
After this, took fulltime position in 2002 with State of Wisconsin at a treatment 
center for people convicted for sexually violent crimes. Applied because wanted 
to have consistent job—days, no weekends, and holidays. Worked at this job for 
six years. 
0.42.31 
On the experience: was again very different from prior jobs. Had to learn the 
psychological aspects of the job: there was a lot of manipulation, game-playing—
it was its own community, and you had to understand the community. Again, a 
hierarchy of who was in charge both from a staff and patient perspective. 
0.43.19 
On the patient hierarchy: since medical was viewed as a safe ground, patients 
could sometimes harm themselves, in order to get out of the security hierarchy. 
But security trumped medical, for safety purposes.  
0.44.24 
Interviewee was primary care provider for entire facility, with an MD—again 
very collaborative—and various nurses. About 200 people in the facility 
population, but great variation in the degree to which each requested medical 
services. 
0.45.28 
Interviewee again felt that there was a gap between prior experience and this 
facility. But a “huge glaring difference”: people at the camp did not have control 
over their disability, but people at Sandridge did. “There was always an agenda 
for people there.” Goal of facility was for people to receive treatment. 
0.46.58 
On the mental health aspect: a psychiatrist worked there, with whom interviewee 
collaborated, and prompted her to return for mental health certification. 
0.47.26 
Was prompted to do this by trying to understand different aspects of mental 
health. Was interested in difference between apparent behavioral condition and, 
say, mania. So, needed to have better assessment to provide better care for these 
patients. 
0.48.15 
Feels that there was a stigma about mental health nursing. “I remember getting an 
email, from the continuing education department at UW-Madison, asking whether 
I had any interest in mental health study … and that there was possibly a 
scholarship available … There was a more recognized need at that time; that was 
around the time that the program started.” Began the program in January 2007, 
while still working at Sandridge, getting a post-Master’s certificate. 
0.50.21 
But the ‘flow’ at this position was new. Had been used to write SOAP notes—the 
‘subjective/objective assessment’ plan. But teacher ‘kicked back’ first psychiatric 
notes: didn’t include a ‘mental status’ exam. Tried to write a more physiological, 
but again rejected: finally discovered it was more an assessment of the person as a 
“whole being.” Felt that this required an important adjustment in perspective.  
0.51.55 
Learning to do psychiatric assessments changed nature of engagement with 
patients at Sandridge. Felt that this was “much more in-depth.” Example: one 
difficult patient at Sandridge presented with symptoms that suggested a heart 
Page 7 of 9 
 
attack to interviewee. “When he came back, he said something profound to me. 
He said, ‘Thank you for taking the time to care about me.’” Interviewee felt that 
she had caught symptoms only because of mental-health training and realizing 
that this was not a patient likely to complain needlessly about physical symptoms; 
this led to the heart-attack diagnosis that saved patient’s life. So even though not a 
mental health episode, mental health training was crucial to giving care. 
0.54.26 
Two to three years program, continuing to work at Sandridge. Concealed a 
pregnancy at the time at Sandridge—because it could cause difficult patient 
interactions with patients. But shortly after giving birth, turned in resignation 
because of qualms about having to explain work to children. 
0.55.34 
After this, took a job at a clinic in Minnesota, focused on family health but with 
understanding that would also work in mental health. This was an unusual 
combination of specialties. A small town with very limited access to healthcare. 
0.56.31 
On approaching this job: Felt that “now had whole patient to take care of”. No 
longer just treating diabetes, etc.; asked about depression and other psychiatric 
conditions. Had patient who was diagnosed with psychotic break: previously, 
would have sent patient to ER, thinking that he/she was “just having a ‘crazy’ 
episode—I say ‘crazy’ now sarcastically;” but was instead able to provide better 
care. 
0.58.08 
On relationships with other staff: “It became a common sentence to hear: ‘This is 
one of Jen’s patients. And I take it to be a bit stigmatizing too, that sentence.” But 
felt that this meant interviewee was able to provide better and more individualized 
care. Could consult with others from afar in this job; but again, couldn’t consult 
with anyone ‘down the hall.’ 
0.59.21 
While still at this job, again went back to school at UW-Madison—the DNP 
program—in 2010. Motivation: “If I can be completely honest—there was more 
education to get! Why would I miss that?” Also wanted to stay up to date for 
purposes of being a preceptor—giving on-the-job direct supervision person who 
helps someone going through clinicals. The preceptor is someone educated to the 
appropriate level who is willing to serve the university. Also, a huge shortage of 
preceptors, related to general shortage in nursing: especially because a six-month 
preceptorship is time-intensive and usually requires reducing patient load, which 
can cause tension with facility’s tend. A delicate balance between training people 
to do the job and having enough time to do the job. Especially in rural facilities, 
the limited resources make this tension sharper. But rural clinics often understand 
the service-oriented nature of the profession and encourage people to be 
preceptors but ask that it be limited to once a year. There’s also some 
prioritization of people from the local area, who are then a resource who can be 
later hired. 
1.04.56 
On first experiences of being a preceptor: did this first during the Minnesota job 
(with one earlier student at Sandridge). Felt that these were almost like a 
friendship. They had most of her coursework done, and interviewee simply had to 
keep asking ‘What would you do next?’ Not so much ‘lecturing’ or direct 
teaching at this level of advancement of the student. These students had found 
about interviewee through word of mouth and directly asked if interviewee would 
be willing to take a student. Those who do it more consistently are entered into a 
Page 8 of 9 
 
database at UW-Madison, that can often be drawn on again. Students often are 
tried to be placed in a geographical area that’s conducive to learning—a local area 
to reduce travel—but not often with specific persons. 
1.07.49 
Felt that DNP program was again very exciting—and “trailblazing; we were the 
first cohort, the psychiatric cohort”. Program had come out of discussions in mid-
2000s about the transition to a terminal nursing program. This in general not a 
psychiatric-focused program: could specialize in different areas. Psych/mental 
health is just one specialty—but three of first cohort happened to be interested in 
mental health. This was 2 years plus 2 summers, when done as a post-Master’s 
option; when coming straight out of BSN, it’s a five-year program. Had to 
complete a clinical project (instead of a thesis) expanding knowledge and 
leadership. Interviewee’s project was on incorporating mental health into family 
clinics. Although this sounds simple, it’s complicated and full of ‘red tape’ and 
stigma obstacles, including billing issues and certification for clinic as out-patient 
mental-health center and paperwork issues (new questions that needed to be 
asked, and dealing with patients who objected to these questions). 
1.12.23 
Feels that patients’ reaction to having a mental-health worker in the clinic is 
mixed: some will refuse to take appointments with a mental-health worker, even 
when it’s a referral within a clinic. Some patients claim that it’s “against their 
belief system—and just can’t see themselves ever taking the medication.” Others 
react with relief. Feels that Affordable Care Act helped: allowed people to self-
refer, and increased coverage for this kind of care. But at same time, “we still 
don’t have enough providers. There’s decreased access because we just don’t 
have enough people doing the job”—feels that this extends to mental health 
overall. Milwaukee took an initiative to train more mental-health workers. But 
there are a lot of steps, and it takes time and effort.  
1.15.20 
Feels that people now much more want to go into field. Have large group of 
family practice providers in own regional areas but then realizing that there is 
literally no one to refer to, and someone has to step up, and a lot of them will 
apply with that as their goal—there’s no one else in their area, and they’re taking 
on that role now. 
1.16.24 
After DNP, kept working at previous job, implementing DNP work at this clinic. 
“I still consider that my baby.” In 2014, took first psychiatric mental health DNP 
student as preceptor. Then interviewee’s influential mentor convinced interviewee 
to begin teaching, and so began teaching at School of Nursing. Students who do 
longer clinicals ‘touch base’ with interviewee; interviewee also teaches two 
classes. Five people currently in first year of program; six in second—this a 
typical size. UW-Milwaukee and Oshkosh and Eau Claire also have similar DNP 
programs, and Marquette and perhaps one more. But not all have psychiatric 
specialties. Each school tries to have its own unique specialty, to reduce 
competition between schools. But with UW-Madison starting its own post-
master’s psych program, there is a worry about this. 
1.20.21 
On what ‘stigma’ means to interviewee: “What I see stigma as is a decrease in the 
value of what the patient is. That somehow the symptoms they’re experiencing 
and exhibiting makes them less of a person, not then worthy of the same level of 
Page 9 of 9 
 
care. Which is so completely contradictory to what the concept of nursing is. And 
I really feel that every patient deserves the same level of care.” 
1.21.22 
Feels that is still tackling this in system where interviewee works, e.g., when a 
patient presents with intellectual disabilities. Because of mental health diagnoses, 
provider said “I don’t see any services I can provide for this patient. So, it was 
back to square one, advocating for this patient to be seen.” 
1.22.37 
Often talks about example of a patient who had symptoms as result of a car 
accident—this patient would not be turned away—so why would you turn away a 
patient where it’s “wrapped differently”? Feels that part of the stigma results from 
sensationalized media coverage of people who have sought mental health care and 
then ‘shot up a movie theater.’ “But you can’t base your care on a ‘what-if’ when 
the ‘what-if’ is sitting there in front of you.” Feels that because each person has a 
capacity for violence, doesn’t make sense to limit or not provide care based on a 
vague worry about some patient later being violent—most people, across different 
kinds of health problems, simply will not be violent. 
1.24.29 
On what a psych nurse is: “Caring, empathetic, holistic, comprehensive, 
accepting.” Feels that these are skills that are innate to nursing, but become more 
refined depending on what area you work in. In order to become interested in 
nursing, have to have some level of these. 
1.25.34 
On what would change about psychiatric services in Wisconsin: “We need more 
providers.” Some patients have to drive 2-3 hours to see a provider; feels that this 
is partly the rural nature of large parts of the state coupled with the lack of 
providers. Initiatives and incentives work to try to keep people in more rural 
areas, but interviewee feels this is a short-term fix, limited to meeting a service 
commitment, for a problem that requires a deeper solution. Feels that 
collaboration over phone is not a substitute for in-person care. 
1.28.18 
Feels that psychiatric nursing is an art: “It’s understanding that person and how 
they have been molded by their past … and then working with that. Not being 
able necessarily to change those things, but working with the patient where they 
are … And you really have to fully embrace and accept that the past is part of the 
present.”
