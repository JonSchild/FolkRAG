So help me gracious efery day,

Dot funny little baby.

Und gorrybarric he must ead,

In every neighbor comes;

Others, " Bless its gums I" 
My feelings were so glorious, 
Describe them no one can; 
And the ladies seem to look on me 
As a 
very clever man. 
Srosc_EN.— They said, " Mister Snooks, you ought to feel thankful, Sir! 
I 
said, " I 
do, I

said, "I

On the day I 
married, so was Jones; 
Who said, quite on the sly, 
Who'll be a 
happy father first 
I 
wonder, you or I? 
Jones always thinks he's number one; 
To-day, that bliss is mine; 
So, when we meet, I'll have some fun, 
And crack a 
bottle of wine. 
SPOKEN.— Anti drink the darling's health, and, with a 
look full of 
meaning, I 
shall observe to Jones, Bush !— CHORUS. 
4 With a 
parent's fond affection, now, 
I 
feel all of a 
glow; 
But, what to name the lovely babe, 
I 
don't exactly know: 
I'd like to call him something grand, 
And worthy of a " Snooks." 
And when Ae's christened, you must come 
And see how nice he luoks.

With fifes and drums a- playing martial airs. 
From Ulster, Munster, Connamara, you see we are on hand, 
To march with the music to the tune of the Branigan's Baud;

we march so gayly down the street, 
And eery one we meet says, don't they step it neat 
We smile on all the girls we meet, 
While marching down behind the famous Branigan's Band.

Mark time, keep step, forward, march away ! 
With eyes out, tees in, march in grand array! 
Shoulder arms, with head erect, togethet• hand in hand, 
Like heroes bold : he young and old will march with the Brant-
gala's Band. 
The chambermaids in the big hotels, try raise the windeys 
high, 
Far handkerchiefs they're waving towels to catch our soldiers' 
eyes ;
  
They've eft their hash to come out and fraash when the mar-
shal gives command; 
Then we all raise our hats to the tune of the Branigan's Band ; 
Oh ! don't their hearts go pit- a-pat, 
As each one lifts his hat, the lean as well as fat, 
Says, there's my Dan, there goes my Pat, 
He's the Daisy swell that's with the famous Branigan's Band. 
Mark time, ete. 
Oh, we had a 
ball in Emerald Hall, and an illegant ,opner, too; 
There was beans and peas and frigazees, and oysters tat for you, 
With pickled stews, and hullaboloos, and Irish quaii so geand ; 
Beets, and cheese, and some potheen for the boys of the Brani-
gan's Band. 
Oh! it's then we snug, and danc'd fP reel, 
And oh ! how good we feel, we make the ladies squeal, 
So when morning comes it's home we steal, 
With the boys all drunk as lords, with the Braniaan's Band.

LET'S sing a 
song as we march along 
For the land where the grass grows green, 
Our Em'rald Isle, where lassies smile 
Like g. bright May morn sunbeam. 
For fighting, or for pleasure, 
We are the ladies' joy, 
For fun beyond all measure, 
Call the bold Hibernian boys. 
ClIORIT.S. 
We're sons of Erin's Isle, free-hearted all the while, 
Happy Irish lads are we who never fear no noise, 
Loyally we stand for dear old Ireland, 
Hip, hip, hip, hip, hurrah 
for the bold Hibernianboys. 
You may search this wide world all around, 
From France to Hindostan, 
Where'er you roam, its a 
truth well known, 
You'll find an Irishman. 
Quick witted, always ready 
To welcome you with joy, 
It's Sack, Dan, Mike or Teddy, 
Each bold Hibernian boy. 
We're sons, etc. 
'Then cheer, boys, cheer for Erin dear, 
The home of Thomas Moore,

Such heroes by the score. 
Our country's persecutions

justice the resolution, 
Of each bold Hibernian boy.

THE LOST CHILD. 
Words by HOOD. 
Music by SNIP. 
The Music of this song is published by Ouvsn DrrsoN & Co., 277 Wash-
ington street, Boston, Mass. 
Price 30 cents. 
ONE day, as I 
was going by that part of Holborn christen'd High, 
I 
heard a 
wild and sudden cry that chill'd my very blood; 
Out from a 
court like one possess'd, a 
woman ran with heaving 
breast; 
She turned her East, turn'd her West, and then bounced thro' 
the mud. 
At length her pent-up fury ' gan to reach that boiling point, just 
capable of speech, 
And with a 
cry as wild as ocean birds with wild exclaim, she 
gave her sorrow words. 
Cs, Lord 
0, dear I 
my heart will break—I 
shalt go stick, 
staring, stark wild! 
Has over a 
one seen anything like a 
lost- looking crying child ? 
Lawk help me! I 
don't know where to look or run! 
If I 
only 
knew whicll way, 
But a 
child as is lost in the " Seven Dials " is like a 
needle in 
a 
bottle of hay. 
Oh, will no one tell me where he's gone? 
With bursting grief 
my heart is torn ; 
I 
wish I 
never had been born—I've lost, I've bast my child. 
Do, good people, move on, and don't be staring like a 
parcel of 
stupid young pigs; 
Saints forbid ! perhaps he's been inveigled up a 
court, for the 
sake of his clothes, by the prigs 
He'd got on nearly all his best, and they wasn't so very much 
tore; 
His jacket and pants cost eighteen pence—but I 
shan't see him 
nor them any more. 
Oh, will no one tell me where he's gone'? 
With bursting grief 
my heart is torn ; 
/ 
wish I 
never had been born—I've lost, I've lost my child. 
He'd got on a 
very good pinafore, with two slits and a 
burn on 
the breast.; 
But his shirt, it's lucky I'd in the washtub, or it might have 
gone with the rest ; 
He'd a 
goodish sort of a 
hat, if the crown was left in, and not 
so much jagged at the brim, 
With one shoe off—and the shoe's a 
boot, and not a 
tit, and 
you'll know him by that, if it's him. 
Oh, trill no one tell me where he's gone ? 
With bursting grief 
my heart is torn ; 
I 
wish I 
never had been born— I've lost, I've lost my child.

THE LOST CHILD.—Concluded. 
The last time as I 
ever seed him was with my own two blessed 
motherly eyes, 
Sittin' as good as goold in the gutter, a- making of little dirt-
pies ; 
Why should he leave the court, where he %vas better off than 
all the other boys 7 
With two bricks. an old shoe, nine oyster- shells, and a 
dead 
kitten, by way of toys ? 
Oh, will no one tell me where he's gone 1 With bursting grief 
my heart is torn; 
I 
wish I 
never had been born—I've lost, I've lost my child. 
And if I 
call him a 
beauty, it's no lie, but only as a 
mother 
ought to speak— 
I 
never set eyes on a 
handsomer face—only it ain't been washed 
for a 
week; 
As for his hair, tho' it's red, it's the nicest red, when I've time 
just to show it the comb— 
I'll owe him five pounds, and a 
blessing besides, as will bring 
him safe and sound home ! 
Oh, will no one tell me where he's gone 7 With bursting grief 
my heart is torn ; 
I 
wish I 
never had been born—I've lost, I've lost my child. 
He's blue eyes and not to be call'd a 
squint, the' a 
little cast 
he has got. 
And his nose is still a good ' un, tho' the bridge is broken by 
falling over a 
pewter pint-pot; 
Ph, Billy, I'm as hoarse as a 
crow, thro' calling after you, you 
young sorrow, 
find I 
shan't have half a 
voice left for crying " red- herrings," 
to-morrow! 
Oh, will no one tell me where he's gone? 
Vfltli bursting grief 
my heart is torn ; 
I 
wish I 
never had been horn—I've lost, I've lost my child. 
I 
only wish l'd got him safe in these arms—oh, wouldn't I 
hug 
and kiss him ! 
I 
never thought how precious 116 was—but a 
child don't feel like 
a 
child till you miss him ; 
Why, there he is, Punch and Judy hunting—it's that young 
wretch, Billy, as certain as sin ; 
But—just let me get him by the scruff of the neck, and I 
won't leave a 
whole bone in his skin! 
Oh, you little varmint! ain't I 
riled I 
but saints be praised, I've 
found my child! 
With joy I 
shall go almost wild I 
I've found, I've found my 
child.

W ITT. 
CHARACTER. 
SPAM? SL7BOOTS. A 
well-to-do, old fashioned business man of the present 
day. Jolly and comfortable. 
[SCENE. —A 
parlor in 1st E. 
htsic for opening. 
Enter SLY-
BOOTS (during music), chuckling.] 
! 
well! well! Egad; I 
think the world is coming 
to an end. 
Have I 
toiled all these years of my life— and built 
up this splendid business out of a 
mere song as I 
may say— 
to be told by my own children that I 
know nothing of the 
world, and am but a mere fool in all business transactions? 
By all that's funny! 
It makes me laugh! (Thinks.) If I was 
of a 
different temperament, it might make me cry! 
But I'm 
not made of such stuff as that! 
Why—I 
suppose— if I 
was to 
let them have their own way, we should soon see the sign of 
the old firm changed from " Slyboots and Sons" to " Slyboots 
and Father!" " Slyboots and Father ?" (Chuckling.) 
Well, 
well! 
Boys will be/boys—and I 
suppose I 
was one of them 
myself once. 
Though it's a 
good many years ago. 
But no! 
(Reflecting.) In those days it was not the fashion for boys to 
advise fathers—but for fathers to teach and control sons. 
Young America hadn't been invented then. 
And there was 
less smoking cheap cigars and standing at street corners. Ah! 
times have changed since then. 
But not with me. 
No— no! 
Not with me! FM the same jolly old fellow I 
ever was. And 
if things do go a 
little askew sometimes— as they will with 
every one—few worry themselves less about the matter than I 
do. 
I 
look upou everything that happens as ALL LNT THE W AY 
OF A

Cella voce. 
As age approached—I 
felt more wise, 
' And took to myself a 
wife! 
But experience proved me still quite green;— 
For she caused me sorrow and strife. 
'Gainst my opinion,— right or not! 
She'd e'er have her last say; 
And like all women -- large or small— 
She'd surely have her way. REFRAIN. -Ha, ha, &o.

THE LADS OF THE VILLAGE. 
While the Lads of the Village shall merrily, ah! 
Sound their tabors, I'll hand thee along: 
And I 
say unto thee, that verily, ah ! 
Thou and I 
will be first in the throng. 
Just then when the swain who last year won the dow'r, 
With his mates shall the sports have begun, 
When the gay voice of gladness resounds from each bower, 
And thou lonoist in thy heart to make one. 
Those joys which are harmless what mortal can blame! 
Ms my maxim that youth should be free; 
And to prove that my words and my deeds are the same, 
Believe -me, thou'lt presently see.

Of •• Father dear, come home," 
fate of hungry little Ben, 
Who sent for him to come; 
How the old man used to " smile," 
And cause the family pain, 
But Ile let up for a 
little while, 
And then got drunk again. 
CHORUS. 
We've given him up for gone. 
He's lying in the lane, 
And almost every body knows, 
The old man's drunk again. 
He takes his morning nip, 
And loafs about the door; 
He told his family more than once, 
That he won

But then be would forget 
From " benzine" to abstain, 
The police, they would come and say. 
"The old man's drunk again." 
We've given him up for gone, kte. 
He'd smash poor mother's nose, 
And upset brother Ned, 
Atli drive us all into the street, 
Then tumble into bed ; 
And when he'd be asleep, 
We'd go back and remain, 
Until he woke and left the house, 
To come home drunk again. 
We've given him up for gone, &c.

Stop drinking like a

Or we'll rebel and " go for you,"

WHEN SAMMY COMES HOMX . 
Words and Music by G. W. HCIIT. 
I 
love a 
valiant soldier bold, 
Nineteen years old, with plenty of gold 
On his dress, and if the truth he's told 
He's awful fond of me. 
The one that I 
love his name is Sam, 
Such a 
darling is Sam, without any cram; 
I 
like him far better than raspberry jam, 
For his like yet I 
never did see. 
CHORUS. 
0 sha'n't I 
be glad when Sammy comes home, 
When Sammy comes home, when Sammy comes home, 
Oh sha'n't I 
be glad when Sammy comes home, 
When Sammy comes home in the morning. 
He wears a 
red coat and a 
sword by his side, 
With spurs on his heels and long whiskers beside, 
And sometimes has a 
big horse tor to ride, 
0 
don't he look martial and grand. 
On the top of his hat a 
feather there grows, 
Put there I 
Fun ose to show how the wind blows, 
His hair is Mageni a, and so is his nose; 
With the handsomest form in the land. 
0, sha'n't I 
be glad, itc. 
My Sammy has travelled to many a 
shore, 
Where the elephants fly and the crocodiles roar, 
And, oh, should he never come back any more, 
For my Sammy rd die in despair. 
No one could imagine what he has gone tbro', 
He can talk foreign languages until all is blue; 
French, Dutch, Spanish, Persian, and Irish, too, 
To hear him would make you all stare, 
0 
sha'n't I 
be glad, &a. 
I 
shall never forget when he told me his love, 
And vowed by n11 the stars above, 
And squeezed my poor fingers as well as my glove, 
I 
believed every word. that be said 
But, oh, when he said that abroad he must hie, 
And wished me good-bye, I 
thought I 
should die, 
Bo I 
sat myself down and had a 
good cry • 
For without him I'd surely be dead. 
sha'n't I 
be glad, d&e. 
PRETTY LITTLE HOOP SKIRT MAKER. 
I've fallen in love with a 
pretty young girl, 
My wife I 
think I'll make her, 
I 
met her first on Baltimore street, 
She's a 
pretty little hoop skirt maker, 
Such charming feet, for I 
watched her heels, 
As I 
came up behind her, 
There may be a 
fairer in the land, 
But I 
don't know where to find her. 
CHORUS, 
For she's just about the age and all the rage, 
Is my Matilda Baker, 
She looks so fair, with her yellow, curly hair, 
She's a pretty little hoop skirt maker. 
I 
introduced myself as soon, 
As I 
could overtake her, 
By saying, " will you my umbrella share," 
To her home I 
said I'd take her, 
Yes certainly, she spoke so nice, 
And chatted on so gaily ; 
Oh I 
don't I 
love that handsome girl, 
And so, I 
meet her daily. 
For she's, f&e. 
To the dancing rooms about the town, 
On Saturday nights I'd take her, 
There's not another pair can cut and shuffle there, 
Like me and Matilda Baker, 
Sometimes we to the theatre go, 
And don't she look so fine oh 
And as soon as I've saved cash enough, 
I 
mean to make her mine oh I 
or she's, cke.

When first I 
met the firm of Green, 
'Twas on my journey down 
To spend a 
day at Rosherville, 
" 
Just like a 
swell from town." 
The Widow loved romantic scenes, 
And a 
squeeze on the sly: 
But when my arm went round her waist, 
The boy began to cry! 
SPOKEN.—He declared I 
was hurting his Mamma, and woult. 
insist upon sitting between vs. on ly fancy making love to a 
girl with a 
boy in the way, but, she saul to him in a 
voice so sweez: 
Cao.—Tonamy, make room for your Uncle, & a. 
3 
The mother told her loving on 
To watch the passing tiain, 
" 
But no," he said, " my Uncle Fred" 
Will kiss your hand again 
The Widow blushed, a 
maiden blush, 
And I 
was not myself; 
For who could make love on a 
seat, 
In front of that young Elf? 
SPOKEN.— Yes, it would never do to make love before the boy, and 
the Widow said—"Xot before the boy. Fred. not before the boy; just 
then we went under a tunnel, and she said: 
CHO .— Tommy, make room for you Uncle, &e. 
4 
In a 
snug retreat at Rosherville, 
I 
went down on my knees, 
And asked if she would fly with me 
Across the bright blue seas. 
She sighed, and said " You wicked man, 
But how about the child ? " 
And clasped him fondly to her breast, 
While I 
the agony piled! 
SPOKEN.—I said," My lovely of all lovely beings, let us fly to some 
fol eion clime. where I 
will protect you and your boy." 
She answered, 
'and said, " How about my Itttle pie shop in Seven Dials? " " Oh 
Bloomsbury 
do you keep a 
pie shop ?" 
Cno.—Tommy, make room for your Uncle, &c.

TOMMY, MAKE ROOM FOR YOUR AUNTIE. 
Ant. —" Tommy, Make Room for Your Uncle." 
As sung by Miss JENNIE H UGHES. 
Now Miss Fitzwilliam of Union Square 
Presents herself to you, 
And you may guess, when she is dressed, 
Of gents she knows a 
few ; 
A 
widower fell in love with me 
While riding hi a 
train ; 
He had his little boy with him, 
Who caused us both much pain. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, the confounded young urchin caused me a 
great 
deal of pain and sorrow, and the widower, his father, introduced 
me to the little boy as his auntie, and during the whole of the jour-
ney the father had to say— 
CHORUS. 
Tommy, make room for your auntie, 
There's a 
little dear ; 
Tommy, make room for your auntie, 
I 
want her to sit here ; 
You know papa has got a 
cake, 
And that he'll give to you ; 
So don't annoy, there's a 
good boy, 
Make room for your auntie, do. 
When first I 
met this widower, 
'Twos on the journey down 
To spend a 
day at Long Branch, 
Just like a 
swell from town; 
The widower loved romantic scenes, 
And a 
squeeze on the sly; 
But when his arm went round my waist 
The boy began to cry. 
SPOKEN.— He declared his papa was hurting me, and would in-
sist upon sitting between us; only fancy making love to a 
girl 
with a 
little boy in the way; but his father said to him in a 
voice 
BO sweet— 
Tommy, make room, etc. 
The father told his loving son 
To watch the passing train ; 
But no, he said, my dear papa, 
You'll kiss that lady again • 
Of course I 
blushed a 
maiden blush, 
And he was not himself; 
For who could make love in a 
car, 
In front of that young elf? 
SPOKEN, —
Yes, it would never do to make love before the boy, 
and when the widower pressed me I 
said " Not before the boy, sir 
.-not before the boy "— just then we went under a 
tunnel, and— 
Tommy, make room, etc. 
OUR SERVANT'S SECRET BALL. 
Last week our servant's ball took place, 
So grand a 
rout I 
ne'er did trace ; 
Being masters flunky I 
had my say, 
And placed things in a 
proper way. 
The party came, some short, some long, 
We mustered twenty-seven strong; 
We all looked large though we were small, 
At our servant's secret ball. 
CHORUS. 
The bones and banjo so did play, 
In turn we all did dance away; 
I 
never shall forget the noise and squall, 
We 
had at our servant's secret ball. 
John dressed himself in Betty's frock, 
And so amused the blessed stock ; 
Our Sally wore the butler's coat, 
And put on a 
false Billy•goat. 
Miss Jane put on master's smalls, 
The nurse wore Harry's overalls ; 
The Bobbies to their sweethearts did stall, 
Yes—to keep order at our servant's Ball. 
The bones, &o. 
Some came as niggers brown and black, 
And the girls lips they did smack ; 
All their designs appeared quite dark, 
For with every kiss they left a 
mark. 
Our cook's chap the whole bog did go, 
He sang and danced Bob Ridley 0 ; 
He upset chairs and tables all, 
At our servant's secret Ball. 
The bones, &e 
The butler kept its in a 
roar, 
For he snug and looked just like the Cure; 
And master Thomas he got tight, 
And nearly set the crib alight. 
The chaps hugged the girls upon the sly, 
They got kissed to death, or very nigh; 
When a 
double-knoc:: surprised us all, 
At our servant's secret Ball. 
The bones, &o. 
It's master's knock, exclaimed young Fan, 
In all directions off we ran; 
Some in the dust hole there did roll, 
Others rushed amongst the coal. 
With to band we knew not what to do, 
So we sent them up the flue; 
And down Caine master amidst it all, 
To finish up our secret Ball. 
The bones, &o. 
He then called lots of Bobbies in, 
0, such a 
row, 0 such a 
din ; 
Such mangled forms there met my eyes, 
We all looked like a 
set of guys. 
The Police made us make our retreat 
And turned the whole lot in the street; 
So we lost our places one and all. 
All thro' our servant's secret Ball. 
The bones, & e.

THE OLD BACHELOR. 
AIR :•'-" The Old Maid." 
When I 
was a 
schoolboy aged ten, 
Oh mighty little Greek I 
knew; 
With my short strip'd trousers, and now and then 
With stripes upon my jacket too 
When I 
saw other boys to the play ground run, 
I 
threw my old Gradus by, 
And I ! eft the task I 
had scarce begun— 
" 
There'll be time enough for that,' said I. 
When I 
was at college my pride was—dress, 
And my groom, and my bit of blood; 
13 at as for my study, I 
must confess 
That I 
was content with my stud. 
I 
-was deep in my tradesmen's books, I'm afraid, 
Tito' not in my own, by the bye; 
An !):.svlien rascally tailors came to be paid— 
" 
There'll be time enough for that,' said I. 
I 
was just nineteen when I 
first fell in love, 
And I 
scribbl'd a 
deal of rhyme ; 
AD ] 1 
tailed to myself in a 
shady grove, 
And I 
thought I 
was quite sublim 
I 
was torn from my love I 'twas a 
dreadfnl blow, 
And the lady she wiped her eye ; 
But I 
didn't die of grief, oh dear me, no— 
" 
There'll be time enough for that," said I. 
The next was a 
lady of rank, a 
dame, 
With blood in her veins, you see; 
With the leaves of the peerage she fann'd the flame, 
That new was consuming. me. 
But tho' of her gr at descent she spoke, 
I 
found she was still very high, 
And I 
thought looking up to a 
wife no 
" 
There'll be lime enough for that," said I. 
My next penchant was for one whose face 
Was her fortune, she was so fair 1 
Ohl she spoke with an air of enchanting grace, 
But B. man caanot live uron air.

THE OLD BAOHELOR.—[CoNcLuDED.] 
And when poverty enters the door, young Love 
\Yid out of the casement fly; 
The truth of the proverb l'd no wish to prove— 
" 
There'll be time enough for that," said I. 
My next was a 
lady who loy'd romance, 
And wrote very splendid things; 
And she said with a 
sneer when I 
asked her to dance, 
"Sir, I 
ride upon a 
horse with wings." 
There was ink on h, r 
thumb when I 
kiss'd her hand, 
And she whisper'd, " If you should die 
I, will write you an epitaph gloomy and grand"— 
" 
There'll be time enough for that," said I. 
left her, and sported my figure and face, 
At opera, party, and ball; 
I 
met pretty girls at ev'ry place, 
But I 
found a 
defect in all. 
The first did not suit me. I 
cannot tell how, 
The second I 
cannot say why; 
And the third, bless me, I 
will not marry now— 
" 
There'll be time enough for that," said I. 
I 
looled in the glass, and I 
thought I 
could trace, 
A 
sort of a 
wrinkle or two ; 
So I 
ma e 
up my mind that I'd make up my face. 
And come out as good as new. 
To my hair i 
imparted a 
little more jet, 
And I 
scarce could suppress a 
sigh; 
But I 
cannot be quite an old bachelor yet— 
No, " there's time enough for that," said I. 
I 
was now fifty-one, yet I 
still did adopt 
All the airs of a 
juvenile beau; 
But somehow whenever the question I 
popp'd, 
The girls with a 
laugh said " No." 
I 
am sixty to-day, not a 
v( ry young man, 
And a 
bachelor dooni'd to die, 
So youths be advised and wed while you can— 
" 
There's no thee to be lost," say I.

Now maybe you will not believe 
How happy I 
did feel; 
That day I (dear) lost some thousands, 
But then I 
didn't squeal; 
My mind was occupied that day 
With only one idea, 
'Twas baby's got a 
tooth—oh ! joy 
The precious little dear! 
SPOICEN.--WS true I 
had to walk the floor with it half the 
night, and beat the paragoric over the gas, and nearly froze; 
but then imagine a 
father's vmother's) joy as he ( she) thought 
of— 
Dada (mamma), come see, etc. 
I'd let it bite my finger, 
And then 'Would chew my thumb; 
It seemed to please it really, 
With joy I 
was quite dumb. 
The day ' twas born I 
felt so glad— 
'Twas nothing unto this! 
Our baby's got a 
tooth, I 
know, 
Excuse a 
father's ( mother's bliss. 
SPOREN. — Why, really I 
had to avoid all my intimate acquain-
tances that day, for I 
felt so happy that I'd have given my 
last cent away I 
actually believe. 
Why, itraminta Flapjack 
came in with tears in her eyes and said, " Have you heard the 
news 1" 
I 
said, " Why of course ! 
our baby's got a 
tooth." 
" 
Oh ! no," she cried. with an additional burst of grief; " my 
mother is dead !" 
Well, then, you can imagine my ecstasy, 
when I 
could not see her grief without being told. 
I 
said, 
" 
My dear, I 
sympathise with your grief, but Pm so overjoyed, 
for this morning dada (mamma) said "— 
Dada (mamma), come see, etc.

Reverses in business brought me to a 
stand: 
I 
found very soon I 
should smash: 
My friends advised me to fly from the land, 
And seize upon all my loose cash: 
But my reputation was dearer to me 
Than all the bright gold in my till, 
So I 
paid what I 
owed and proudly I 
said, 
If I'm poor, I'm a 
gentleman still. — Cho. 
3. 
One evening last week, the other end of the town, 
Whilst wandering sadly along, 
I 
picked up a 
purse that a 
lady had dropped, 
The temptation to keep it was strong. 
My pockets were empty, but firmly I 
said, 
She shall have her own come what will; 
She looked at my dress as I 
gave it and said, 
"If you're poor, you're a 
gentleman still."— Cho. 
4. 
Last evening I 
rescued a 
poor homeless girl 
Whom a 
swell was insulting: I 
found 
My strength for the moment was something immense, 
As I 
hurled the great brute to the ground. 
He cried out, " you beggar, don't meddle with me 
Or very soon you'll get a 
pill." 
But I 
said, " lay a 
hand on that girl and you'll find 
If I'm poor, I'm a 
gentleman

you for better or worse.

If you are fond of policy and want a

Inform your humble servant by allowing hint the extatic bliss of

cured ham. 
I 
am reluctantly compelled to take my departure, Mollie Darling. 
I've got to buy some buttons for the keno -Gail, s, and I'd rather

" SONG OP THE HERALD PERSONALS." 
Written and sung by HARRY STANWOOD. 
On, for a 
few minutes pray grant your attention, 
As I 
wish some most comical facts just to mention, 
Though perchance you may think my good sense may be peril-
led 
By trying to make any fun from the Herald; 
At what I 
shall state, some folks may look solemn ; 
The part I 
shall read you will be the first column ; 
But explaining the subject is wasting your time, 
So here goes the Personals done up in rhyme. 
" 
Frank, come—I'm in trouble—or addreRs Station D." 
"Now, John, mind the dog ; I 
am dreaming of thee." 
" 
If this should by chance catch the eye of Miss Jane; 
She may learn what on paper we cannot.explain." 
" 
I'm delighted to hear all passed off so merry, 
Dear Sally. 
Come up to the Hamilton Ferry." 
"Jones has come back—be is a 
bully good fellow." 
"Mr. Smith, please return Mrs. Brown's umbrella." 
" 
Will the lady in black state her name and her age 
To the gent who sat next her in the Fifth avenue stage?" 
"Jerry X., won't you please send me word of some sort 1" 
",Friends may call in on Sunday should their whiskey run short." 
" 
Young man dressed in gray may return the cigars 
He removed by mistake from Third avenue cars." 
" 
Phoebe, meet me at Kelly & Leon's to-night, 
To see Neise Seymour kick his leg high as a 
kite." 
" 
For adoption—a 
sweet little girl and her brother, 
Two orphans without any father or mother." 
" 
George is spending his money, I 
think, rather freely." 
" 
Jell Davis sends love to his friend Horace Greeley." 
Kind friends, I 
leave off for fear I 
should offend, 
For the Personals never will come to an end; 
I 
must go, as these lines have fulfilled my ambition, 
And write something myself for to-morrow's edition.

MRS. CASEY'S RAFFLE. 
Written and sung by 11minx KEYNELL. 
Ir. you listen to me for awhile 
l'il tell you a 
tale ; 
You all know Mrs. Casey, down 
The street, that sells the ale. 
She gave a 
raffle for a 
stove, 
And to have a 
dance as well; 
And I 
being the floor manager, 
Had tickets for to sell. 
SPOKEN.—Mrs. Casey is a 
particular friend of John McSwe-
gan, and a 
full cousin of William Waterhouse ; and her husband 
Sam O'Casey, alias Gas House Sam—( he was once employed in 
the Gas House at sixty dollars a 
month, wheeling smoke out in 
a 
push- cart)—he went to the war as a 
soldier, and never re-
turned, and Mrs. Casey raffled off the old stove. 
cuonus. 
But oh, what a 
row ! I 
will tell it to you now I 
Breaking heads, wIth slats of the beds ; 
McGutlin fainted, I 
thought he was dead, 
O'Brien lost his hat, what do you think of that 7 
Mrs. O'Leary lost her hoops at Casey's raffle I 
Now, in came John McIntee, 
Along with Rohrer Dunbar • 
When up jumped O'Brien, the 'fiddler, 
And says, this is going too far. 
But before he had time to open his month, 
He was lying on the floor ; 
And I 
like a 
fighting man, 
Busted through the door. 
SPOREN.—Begorra, I 
never saw such a 
fracas in my born 
days before. Whin they knocked O'Brien down, he bawled out 
for Nixey, and cheese it ; and they came in with billy-jacks, and 
knocked every body down that came in reach of them. 
And 
Nancy McGowan got excited and jumped clear out of a 
pull-
back dress. 
But oh! what a 
row, etc. 
The raffling then did commence, 
As you may understand; 
McGuffin threw forty-four, 
And O'Donnell called his hand. 
But, Mrs. Casey (rot vexed then, 
And ordered thim all out; 
When the fiddler played Patrick's day, 
Then you had ought to hear them shout. 
(I) 
MRS. CASEY'S RAFFLE.—Concluded. 
SPOKEN.—Such shouting you never heard in your life; but 
when the supper was announced, everything became Tliet. 
They had a 
splendid supper. 
There was mackerel and 
cream, and molasses and oysters. 
John Bradley went to vait 
on the ladies. 
He asked one girl what she would have'? 
8:i y 
she, " I 
will have quail.' Says John, " You will have lean 
soup, or you will give your seat to Biddy Doyle." 
Another 
young girl wanted an egg dropped on toast; says John, " You 
will get some old hen to drop it, or you will not get it here to-
night." 
Then Bermidas Conklin wanted to make a 
speech. 
Says he, " Would I 
were an eagle, that I 
might fly over the sea 
and spread the liberty of my country !" 
Says Jim Kelly, " Sit 
down; you would be shot for a 
goose before you got half way." 
But it was— 
But oh! what a 
row, etc. 
Tak'RE'S A BOTTLE ON THE MANTLE. 
Am.—" Letter in the Candle." 
THERE'S a 
bottle on the mantle, 
But it don't belong to me ; 
If 1 
could only smell the flavor, 
How happy I 
would be. 
But I 
dare not approach it, 
For fear some one would come in; 
But I 
would like to take a 
snifter, 
For I 
know it's full of gin. 
CHORUS. 
Small drop of gin, 
To wet my fiery tongue; 
I 
loved you since my childhood, 
Many songs of you I 
have sung. 
Oh! how sadly I 
remember, 
It was two short months ago; 
I 
had a 
bully lunch route, 
But they took me down below. 
They said I 
was a 
vagarant— 
And I 
think it was a 
sin 
To lock me in a 
dungeon, 
And deprive me of my gin. 
Small drop of gin, etc.

THE BLIGHTED GARDENER, 
OR, 
CABBAGES AND TURNIPTOPS.' 
Sung by H ARRY RICKARDS. 
once kept a 
garden where the vegetables did grow, 
But my fate is a 
hard 'un, you'll say when you know 
How I 
loved a 
fair damsel, whose like I 
ne'er saw, 
So graceful and so beautiful, that I 
loved her far more that 
all— 
CHORUS. 
My cabbages and my turniptops. 
My celery and my brokelo,

I'll never love, no, I'll never love 
None but sweet Mary Jones. 
Her parents kept a 
beer shop, Mary served at the bar, 
And used to draw custom from ever so far, 
With her eves bright as diamonds, and hair black as jet, 
She made me feel so fuuniiied, and entirely forget all about--
My cabbages, Etc. 
When I 
stood at the bar, I 
would heave a 
deep sigh, 
And when she looked at me, I'd wink one eye; 
I 
one day plucled up courage, look'd as wretched as could be, 
Said ' I 
love you, sweet Mary 0 ! will you have me ?' and all— 
My cabbages, dm 
Out of the Bar-Parlor rushed a 
sailor pell mell, 
Turned me out of the house, and shook me as well I 
The naughty boys jeer'd me, with mud I 
got splashed, 
Then they followed me home, yes, and smashed all— 
My cabbages, ite. 
Well she married that sailor, she's now a 
gay wife, 
She's left this poor gardener all wretched for life, 
My sufferings and misery there'sno one can tell,

melancholy Horticulturist, and here bids farewell to all—

THE CHARMING YOUNG WIDOW 
I MET ON THE TRAIN. 
Whilst in New-Jersey, a 
letter was sent to me 
From Boston, which bid me quickly repair 
To an uncle; it stated: fast he was dying' 
The wish had expressed to make me his heir. 
So, hurriedly packing a 
few things together, 
Wishing that Boston quickly might gain, 
By a 
first-class express went; in the same carriage. 
A charming young widow I 
met on the train. 
An infant she had, so fondly caressing; 
I 
ventured to ask, if that was her own? 
She answered in words appearing distressing— 
Yes; and its Papa is dead and gone! 
When the question I 
asked, in my face looking— 
That look I 
shall ne'er be forgetting again! 
In fact, fast my heart to herself was hooking, 
Was the charming young widow I 
met on the trri 
As the train it was stopping, the engine to water, 
She asked in a 
hurry—Would I 
be so kind 
Iler infant to take it, the darling so quiet ? 
Of course, I 
replied, I 
don't mind. 
To the refreshment room she went into 
The signal for starting I 
heard but in vain, 
Not a 
glimpse could I 
see of her; the train withou+.

The charming young widow I 
met on the train. 
Loud I 
was shouting, the train to be stopping, 
Out of the window putting my head; 
No answer receiving, the infant I 
took it, 
Discovered, 0 
horror I 
it was dead! 
On its bosom was sewn a 
note—which on reading, 
Found I 
was taken in, done for, quite plain— 
It begged me bury the child for the sake of 
The charming young widow I 
met on the train. 
It was strange to myself that I 
was remarking 
flow quiet a 
child, not hearing a 
sound— 
The sweet little creature asleep was, she told me; 
Quite dead asleep—so, in truth I 
found_ 
I 
took it, and buried the poor little creature, 
Its age or its name I 
could not explain; 
On a 
stone was inscribed—Underneath we-, berneathed in*

GOOD-BYE---ILL SEE YOU LATER, 
'Sung with great success by TONY PASTOR. 
To what I 
hear about the town 
I 
give my close attention; 
The sayings that I 
hear about, 
To you I 
often mention. 
How great the rage for by- words now, 
It couldn't well be greater, 
But the latest one that's come out is, 
Good-bye— I'll see you later. 
Each little boy upon the street, 
Of men an imitator, 
Will holler to a 
boy he'll meet, 
Good-bye— I'll see you later. 
The other evening out I 
walked, 
My leisure time beguiling, 
When into a 
saloon I 
dropped, 
And found the boys a " smiling." 
" 
Come. Tony, j'in us, have a 
drink r 
Cried one wild dissipator. 
Says I, " You'll just excuse me now, 
Good-bye— I'll see you later." 
They held me fast. 
I 
had to drink 
Till my spirits grew elator, 
And very soon I 
staggered out, 
With •' Good-bye—I'll see you later? 
A 
pretty girl I 
met, her eyes 
A 
glance of love shot through me, 
And soon for supper we were bound, 
I 
thouslit, of course, she knew me, 
She drank so much, it really seemed 
'Iwould soon intoxicate her;

GOOD-BYE—I'LL SEE YOU LATEE.—(Comunneo. 
Thinks 1 
she'll break my pocket-book 
Before it gets much later. 
To my dismay I 
caught her soon, 
A-winking at the waiter, 
Saying, " Here's a 
flat !" Says I, " Enough, 
Good-bye--I'll see you later." 
They called on me to pay the bill, 
Which I'd no inclination, 
A policeman, then, they soon brought in 
To take me to the station; 
He called me, saying, " Come along, 
My swindling operator, 
And soon I'll have you in a 
cell, 
Then, good-bye— I'll see you later." 
But I 
tripped him up, and off I 
went 
As swift as any skater, 
And to the peeler hollered out, 
" 
Good-bye—I'll see you later." 
I 
wandered home, and there my wife 
Commenced a 
curtain lecture, 
Says she, a 
nice hour you've come home, 
And what a 
looking picture. 
Of course I 
didn't have the heart 
To scold or irritate her, 
So says I. " Old woman, go to sleep, 
Good-bye— I'll see you later." 
So now Ill finish up my song, 
To you I've come to cater, 
And if I've gained your kind applause.; 
Good- bye—I'll see you later.

MRS. JONES' PARTY. 
Mistress Jones gave a 
musical party, 
And friends she invited them all, 
There was old Mister Bonner so hearty, 
And young Mister Jenkins so tall; 
And singing young ladies they came by the dozen, 
With De Witt's Half-Dime Music tied up in a 
roll. 
Handsome Miss Johnson, her brother and cousin, 
And Bunker who prates of his musical soul. 
And very queer songs they were singing, 
If I 
can remember a 
few, 
As they are in my ears ringing, 
I'll try and repeat them to you. 
After a 
deal of persuasion, 
Miss Johnson consented to sing 
A piece of her vocalization. 
Which doubtless she thought quite the thing. 
She simpered and whimpered is such a 
queer wanner,, 
And down on the instrument. came with a 
swing. 
And thumping five minutes upon the piano, 
For symphony, this, is the song she sang— 
" Oh I 
would I 
were a 
bird." 
Now was not that absurd, 
To hear a 
lady singing, 
She would like to be a 
bird? 
How very strange to see 
Her perched upon a 
tree, 
And screwing up her mouth, 
To whistle some new melody; 
Could she get any rest, 
Tucked up in a 
nest, 
And feeding on canary seed 
And chickweed of the best ? 
So, I 
thouslit it so absurd. 
To wish she m 
as a 
bird, 
But this was net the only very funny song I 
heard. 
A tall, sentimental voting lady, 
Was pressed very bard for a 
song ; 
Did I 
say she was young ? on the shady 
Side of forty, perhaps I 
am wrong. 
She twisted her moutb in a 
curious fashions

MRS. JONES' PARTY.—CONCLUDED. 
Her bands on the instrument came with a 
bang, 
Went over the keys in a 
style she thought dashing, 
And this was the style of the song that she sang— 
" 
0 ! if I 
had some one to love me ?" 
I 
thought it would be a 
hard case, 
If ever she found some one to love her, 
She made such a 
tunny grimace. 
She wanted some one to share her trouble, 
Then care to the winds she would fling, 
And change her from single to double, 
So she continued to sing; 
" 
Oh I 
if I 
had some one to love me I" 
I 
thought, tho' it may be too bad, 
If ' twould put an end to her singing, 
We'd be satisfied if she had. 
Of their singing and shouting quite tired, 
I 
was, when a 
gentleman cried— 
I've a 
song that is always admired, 
Whenever to sing it I 
ve tried ; 
It certainly was not a 
drawing-room ditty, 
I'll try and remember a 
verse if I 
can. 
He claimed our indulgence as well as our pity, 
And clearing his throat, " hem,' in this style began— 
" 
When Johnny comes marching home again, 
Hurrah 1 
Hurrah 1 
We'll give him a 
hearty welcome then, 
Hurrah ! Hurrah! 
The girls will sing and the boys will shout, 
Aud neighbors say, we'll all turn out, 
And we'll all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home, 
And we'll all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home." 
They shouted out till they all were hoarse, 
" 
Hurrah 1 
hurrah 1" 
Discordant voices loud and coarse, 
" 
Hurrah I 
hurran 1" 
So, unobserved, I 
slipped away, 
Well satisfied with ev'ry lay, 
Though I 
didn't feel gay till I 
was safe at home. 
Though I 
didn't feel gay till I 
was safe at home.

I'D CROOSE TO BE A BABY. 
ORIGINAL VERSION. 
rd choose to be a 
baby, 
A darling little flower, 
Without a 
care or sorrow, 
As I 
was in childhood's hour. 
When ladies, Heaven bless them! 
They'd kiss rae, and they'd vow 
That they could almost eat me--'

CIIORI:S. 
I'd choose to be a 
baby, 
A darling little flower, 
For the girls to kiss and cuddle me, 
As they did in childhood's hour. 
'When I 
used to be a 
baby, 
They'd to my cradle creep; 
They'd kiss and hug and cuddle me, 
Till I 
fell off to sleep. 
Yes, they'd kiss and squeeze me, too, 
Till I 
felt anyhow, 
They'd even wash and dress me— 
W

I'd choose to be a 
baby, dic. 
For pleased they were to nurse me, 
They would take me on their lap, 
And would stuff my little belly full 
Of lollipop and pap. 
They would chew me tops and bottoms, 
And if I 
made a 
row, 
They'd press me to their bosoms— 
Why don't they do it now ? 
I'd choose to be a 
baby, /Sze. 
When the ladies used to love me, 
They would make me such nice clothes; 
They would make me nice morocco shoes, 
And wipe my little nose. 
And when the shades of evening came, 
And sleep came o'er my brow, 
They said: It's time to go to bed— 
But they never say so now. 
I'd choose to bo a

Billingsgate wouldn't hold ' em. 
And as fi»r them there Octobers,

Mrs. J. ranted to know what such an animal as that knowed about

When Master Tommy came to where 
The lobsters crawl about; 
He stood and looked some time as if 
lie couldn't make them out:

Them's lobsters, Tom," said Mr. Jones, 
But Tommy shook his head, 
" 
Them ain't lobsters, yah, go on, 
Why, isn't lobsters red ? " 
SroKts —  
Bless his little hennwrcent ' art, said Mrs. Jones, He 
doesn't know as they oilers bile 'em. 
Then when Tommy was shown 
the herrings, he wanted to see some red herrings swimming about. 
But, 
as the man said, the Red Sea was so far ojf, it would be such an ex-
pense to bring them, so he must be saC.vied with

Then Mr. Jones took Master Tom, 
And, much against his wish, 
Give him little lectures 
All about the different fish.

There's real turtle, Tommy— see 1"

do, 
But, I 
say father, I 
should like 
To see mock turtle, too."

soup. 
But Mr. Jones thought he'd conclude his lecture by getting 
Master Tommy to say

And Mrs. J. says she wa; told 
That next year, without 
They'll have in the Aquarium

DOROTHY DREW, 
OR THE CALICO-PRINTER'S 
CLERK. 
AIR I—The Irish Volunteer. 
In Manchester, that cit . of cotton, twist, and twills, 
Lived the subject of my ditty, and the cause of all my ills. 
She was handsome, young, and twenty; her eyes were azure 
blue; 
admirers she had plenty; and her name was Dorothy Drew. 
CHORUS. 
She was very fond of dancing, 
But allow me to remark 
That, one fine day, she danced away, 
With a 
Calico- Printer's Clerk. 
At a 
private ball I 
met her, in Eighteen-Sixty Three: 
I 
never can forget her, tho' she was unkind to me; 
I 
was dressed in the pink of fashion, my lavender gloves w 
new : 
I 
danced the valse Circassian with charming Dorothy Drew. 
She was very fond of dancing, (4:c. 
We Schottisch'd and we Polka'd, to the strains the band did 
play; 
We Valsed and we Mazotirkfid, till she valsed my heart away 
I 
whispered, in this manner, as round the room we flew, 
Doing Var-so-vi-a-na: I 
love you, Dorothy Drew. 
She was vciy fond of dancing, &c.; 
For months and months, attention unto her I 
did pay, 
Till with her condescension she led me quite astray ; 
The money I 
expended, I'm ashamed to tell to you; 
I'll inform you how it ended with myself and Dorothy Drew. 
She was very fond of dancing, tt c. 
I 
received an intimation she a 
visit meant to pay, 
l'nto a 
near relal ion, who lived some miles away; 
In a 
month she'd be returning, I 
must take a 
short Adieu, 
lint her love for me was burning, deceitful Dorothy Drew. 
She was very fond of dancing, dm 
At nine o'clock next morning, to breakfast I 
sat down; 
The smile, my face adorning, was soon changed to a 
frown 
For, in a 
morning paper, a 
paragraph met my view; 
That Jones, a 
Calico-Printer's Clerk, had married Miss Dorothy 
Drew. 
She was very fond 'of dancing, &e.

HAPPY MAN, OR IT CAN'T LAST. 
I'm the happiest man ' neath the sun, 
Altho' I 
am chin deep in trouble; 
I 
contrive to he fuj of my fun, 
To give the blue devils the double. 
I'm blest with the gout and rheumatic, 
I'm mostly a 
martyr of pain; 
I'm lodged in a 
very queer attic, 
But I 
know it's no use to complain. 
Spokes—No. it can't last. 
Now what bad judges we are of our own 
happiness, by scorning the warnings of the good old proverbs. For 
Instance, they teach us to leave well enough alone. Now I 
must try 
to make well bettlF and make bad worse. They say, look before you 
leap ; .1 
jumped out of the frying pan into the fire. 
They say, halt a 
loaf is better than none at all; but I 
wanted a 
whole loaf, so I 
threw 
away dirty water before I 
got clean. 
They say, two heads are better 
than one. so I 
took a 
wife, and caught a 
tartar, and found two of a 
trade could never agree, and proved the proverb, that marry in haste, 
repent at leisure. 
They say beauty is but skin deep, but ugliness is 
deeper. 
If beauty is but skin deep, what a 
fool a 
man must be to 
skim all the cream off the milk and leave nothing but the curd to sour 
in his own. stomach. But I'm not unhappy, oh no! for I 
know it can't 
last. 
CITORus. 
For I 
never meet troubles half way, 
Or fret after things that are passsed; 
If bad luck comes in the way, 
I'm happy, because it can't last. 
I've got neither houses nor land, 
Nor money in funds or in purse; 
3iy furniture's not very grand, 
Some think my posii.on a 
curse. 
I'm threadbare, I'm hamperr.-! with strife, 
On every toe I've got corns 
I've a 
devil that law calls a 
wife, 
And the neighbors all say I've got horn

HAPPY MAN, OR IT CAN'T LAST.—CoNcLuDED. 
Spoken—Yes, I've a 
wife, my wife's got a 
tomfue, well I 
know it, it 
is a 
tongue. 
It's a 
night tongue, a 
day tongue, in fact it's a 
perpetual 
tongue; it hangs on a 
swivel, wags at both ends ; then she keeps a 
jackdaw and poll parrot to help her out with it, and when she's hard 
pushed she'll tread 011 the cat's tail to raise an extra squall, and knock 
down the fireirons by way of an accompaniment. Then there's my 
home, it is a home. My home resembles a 
battle of confusion. A 
hundred schoolboys playing in a 
court; in fact it's like a dustman's 
bell on one side of my ear, and a 
postman's on tie other, 
But I 
am 
aot unhappy, for it can't last. 
For I 
never, ex. 
Now if I 
speak but a 
word of my mind, 
By way of concluding my song ; 
I 
hope you will all be so Lind, 
As to think that I 
don't instance wrong. 
To see you all round me so gay, 
Is the happiest moment I've passed; 
But when you are all gone away, 
I 
shall be happy, because it can't last. 
Spoken—ITh,.t different creatures women are before marriage to what 
they are after it. 
Now, my wife before marriage was as sweet and as 
welcome to me as the first flower in spring, but as soon as the sun of 
matrimony shines on her, she became as changeable as tulips, proud 
as the poppy, thorny as a 
briar, stony as a 
plum, sour as a 
grub. sting-
ing as a 
nettle, hot as a 
horseradish, deadly as night shade, as wanton 
as the ivy, and as destructive as slugs. 
hero was .no pleasing her, 
nor no hoeing her. I 
couldn't lop her, the law wouldn't wop her, then 
she'd run to seed every year, and the little seedlings were as wild as 
the parent stem. 
They'd neither 
transplant or cultivate them. 
There's my home, it is a 
home. My home resembles an hospital. Poor 
little Tommy has been bit by a 
mad dog, poor little harry, he's broke 
his leg, poor little Fanny, she's got the scarlatina, poor little Polly, 
she's got the whooping cough, and the blessed baby's got the measles, 
and I 
expects myself to have the small pox shortly, and through my 
wife's ways we are reduced to one room, and that smokes, but where 
there's a 
will there's a 
way. If the room smokes, put the fire out, if 
the children begin to squall, put them out, and if your wife begins to 
blow you up, put on your hat and go out yourself, it can't last.

THE HAPPY FATHER OF THREE. 
A 
PATHETIC EPISODE. 
Words by F. LANGBIIIDGE. 
Composed and sung by G. II. MACDEEMOTT. 
COME, hush- a- by, dearest of dears ! 
Alit what's to become of poor me 
I've only been married two years, 
And this little chap's number three. 
If at such an astonishing rate 
Our family's always increased, 
It's clearly our terrible fate 
To have twenty-seven at least. 
CHORUS. 
Come, old fellow, mayhaps, if you'll swallow your pap, 
Your mind less excited may be; 
And, my dear little chap, if you won't take a 
nap, 
Whatever's to happen to me 
He's a 
fine little fellow, of course— 
Now, don't begin kicking, I 
beg— 
Such lungs, and as strong as a 
horse— 
There, that's pretty well for a 
leg. 
Beef, bread and potatoes are dear, 
But babies uncommonly cheap; 
The worst of this little one here 
Is somehow, he won't go to sleep. 
Come, old fellow, etc. 
Jane's snoring—just listen to that— 
While I 
shiver out in the cold ; 
I'll wake her, and give her the brat— 
But no! she might happen to scold. 
(11 
57 
TIM HAPPY FATHER OF THREE.—Concluded. 
Come, hush-a-by, baby, kiss, kiss 
He only gets wider awake; 
I 
think after going through this, 
That marriage is quite a 
mistake. 
Come, old fellow, etc. 
Come, hush- a-by, there's a 
good child, 
The clock's striking three, what a 
fix ! 
I'm getting uncommonly wild— 
They're going to call me at six ! 
Of getting the ghost of a 
nap 
My chances appear rather blue ; 
Mild measures have failed, so, old chap, 
I'll try what a 
slapping will do. 
Come, old fellow, etc. 
Stop howling—be quiet, you wretch I 
The neighbors are sure to complain; 
Shut up, or a 
bobby I'll fetch— 
Thieves—murder—fire—pick- pockets—Jane! 
I 
tell you Pm losing my head ; 
I'm chilled to the marrow right through, 
And now, ma'am, I'm going to bed— 
Here take him, and sit on him, do! 
CUOIZUS. 
Oh! he won't drink his pap, and he won't take a 
nap, 
And the clock's struck a 
quarter-past- three, 
And I 
don't care a 
rap if you throttle the chap, 
So long as you take him from me. 
(Throws baby of, and exit frantically.)

THE FEMALE AUCTIONEER 
Well, here I 
am, and what of that 
Methinks I 
hear you cry 
I 
am come, and that is pat. 
To see if you will buy ! 
A female auctioneer I 
stand 
But not to seek for pelf; 
For the only lot I've now on hand, 
Is just to sell myself. 
CHORUS. 
And I'm going, going, going, going. 
Who bids who bids for me ? 
For I'm going, going, going, going, 
Who bids, who bids for me? 
Though some may deem me pert or so, 
They deal in idle strife, 
For where's the girl I'd like to know, 
Would not become a 
wife; 
Indeed, I 
really think I 
should, 
In spite of all alarms, 
So, bachelors, pray be so good 
As just to take me to your arms, 
For I'm going, die. 
Ye bachelors my way tow'rds you, 
Should not your thoughts mislead, 
I've never yet, been called a 
flirt, 
Or coquette—no indeed ! 
My heart and hand I 
offer fair, 
And if you buy the lot, 
I'll vow all Candling I 
will spare, 
When hymen ties the knot 
For I'm going, &c.

TT-119 LADIES' DARLING. 
Sung by Miss KITTY BRO088. 
OF 
all young beaux who the girls most esteem, 
Sure riflemen now in their hearts reign supreme, 
But throughout the band whether youthful or old, 
There's no one like Charley, so gallant and bold, 
For when he's in uniform ( gaiters and all), 
With his rifle and cap, with a 
little round ball, 
To see him march by, the girls they all cry, " Oh, 
Is he not charming, so handsome and tall'?" 
clones. 
For Charley's a 
gallant and gay volunteer; 
As the pride of his comrades he's fam'd far and near, 
And so handsome and brave, oh, he is such a 
dear, 
They call him the ladies' darling. 
As straight as a 
ramrod he marches about, 
With his elbows turn'd in and his toes pointing out, 
While his waist-belt around him so tightly doth twine, 
He looks like a 
wash in a 
rapid decline ; 
His hair up the middle so straightly cloth part, 
And his loves of long whiskaws comb out, oh, so smart, 
That when he draws nigh with glass in his eye, 
No foeman to hurt him could e'er have the heart. 
For Charley, etc. 
He's bold as a 
lion, and makes no pretence 
When he says how he'll fight for his country's defence, 
For he curls his mustache with an aspect so grim, 
I 
tremble to think what may happen to him; 
lie says should an army once venture to land, 
If none of his comrades beside him will stand, 
He'll go out alone, our wrongs to atone, 
And woe to the foeman who comes 'neath his hand, 
For Charley, etc. 
To be a 
crack shot he esteems the first thing, 
And he declares he can bring down a 
fly ( on the wing); 
So he goes every night on the roof- tiles and flats 
To keep up his practice by shooting the cats; 
Should therefore invasion its terrors impend, 
With confidence all may rely on the end, 
Nor tremble, nor chafe, but deem ourselves safe, 
With sweetheart like Charley our homes to defend. 
For Charley, etc. 
S'
ESSIE, 
THE BELLE AT THE BAR. 
fiwas at a 
rail road station, in pursuit of my vocatien, 
I 
saw a 
tall and handsome girl, who stood behind the bar. 
beard some one call her Jessi,?, perhaps, ' twas Mr. Pond, the lessee, 
And her diamond eyes were twinkling, just like the evening star. 
I 
found this pretty dame made love to all that came, 
In a 
quiet sort of way, with her eyes so soft and bright. 
She had lovers half a 
score, al ways some one to adore, 
From the first train in the morning, till the last train out at night. 
SPOSEN.—Yes, tier admirers were, 
cnonrs. 
A tinker and a 
tailor, and a 
soldier and a 
sailor. 
And a 
swell who used to talk about his pa and hie raa, 
A butcher and a 
baker, and a 
quiet looking quaker, 
Al! courted pretty Jsioat the rail-road bar, 
''ow tlii darling littie creatm c. with a 
smile on every feature, 
Was serving all the eustorm.rs, with cakes and bitter beer, 
tind this was on a 
Monday; so, I 
asked her it on Sunday 
She would meet me at the Park gate, xviien she gave me such a 
leer, 
And then she said to me, " most happy I 
should be, 
But I'm sorry to inform you that it's not my Sunday out; 
One Sunday out of nine is the only day that's mine;" 
And then ehe had to leave me just to serve a 
glass of stout. 
SPOKEN.— Yes, but she never informed me that she had on previous 
Sundays walked out with— 
A tinker, etc. 
Well, better late than never, and I 
thought that I 
was clever, 
To get Jessie dear to meet me, when it was her Sune ay out, 
With my hair curled and anointed, at the time and place appointed, 
I 
was there to the minute, and began to look about— 
And when my Jessie came, my heart was in a 
flame, 
When I 
saw her water- fall and her bonnet trimmed so gay. 
She politely took my 
arm, I 
admired her every charm— 
. But judge of my surprise, when I 
heard some urchins say. 
SPOKEN.—I 
say, Bill, if there ain't Jessie, along with another swetti 
Why, I've seen her with— 
A 
tinker, etc. 
Now nay confidence was shaken, but I 
thought the boys rmstaken, 
And my modesty would not permit to ask if it was true. 
I 
proposed, and she accepted, in a 
manner unaffected, 
And the tears she shed completely hid from me her eyes so blue. 
Then I 
sent her a 
wedding dress, fit for an Empress. 
And saw the porter give it her, while serving at the bar, 
But on our wedding- day, Miss Jessie ran away 
And got married to a 
man who sold the HERALD and the STAR! 
SPOREN.—Yes, and the only consolation I 
had was, she had taken tia 
besides Pv"if,
