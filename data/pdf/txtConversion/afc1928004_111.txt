INTRODUCTION. 
A 
To THE PUBLIC. 
I 
was led to compile the following volume, 
from a 
feeling which has long predominated 
within me, that a 
combination of songs of 
the kind, (songs which have separately ob-
tained the favor of the mirth-loving com-
munity during the past year), would receive 
a 
full share of public patronage. 
Selected • 
with care as regards their freedom from every-
thing that would shock the taste qf the most 
fastidious, the compiler hopes this little vol-
ume will meet with the cordial approbation of 
his patrons. 
I 
am well aware that hundreds 
of song books have flooded the country late-
ly, but all have emanated from the Eastern 
cities. 
This is the first which has been essen-
tially 'Western both in composition and sub-
ject. 
Written in the West! sung in the 
West and arranged to suit the Western taste; 
the author of many, and original singer of 
all! the songs the book contains, I 
can only

INTRODUCTION. 
hope will be read with half the pleasure 
I 
took in their compilation; and if they only 
succeed in raising a 
smile on the face of one 
reader, the purpose of the undersigned will 
have been 
effected. 
Nine-tenths 
of the 
songs within this little volume have been 
written expressly for (or by) me; they have 
never before been published; therefore, I 
at 
least can take the credit of originality for my 
work. 
Leaving the merits or demerits of 
my book to the unbiassed judgment of the 
people, I 
shall conclude by saying—my prin-
cipal aim ever will be, to obtain a 
share of 
their applause and approbation.

TOM RUSSEL'S 
COMIC SONGS. 
THE CHARMING YOUNG WIDOW I 
MET 
IN THE TRAIN. 
AS SUNG BY TOM RUSSEL. 
Air—Grandfather's Days. 
I LIVE in the country, and one morning last sum-
mer, 
A 
letter informed me my uncle was dead, 
Requesting that I 
should go quick to the city, 
He had left me a 
large sum of money, it said; 
Of course I 
determined on making the journey, 
And to go by the very first cars I 
was fain, 
Though had I 
stayed over I 
should not have en-
countered 
That charming young widow I 
met on the 
train 
The widow and I 
side by side sat together, 
The seat it containing just two and no more; 
The silence was broken by my fair companion, 
Who inquired the time by the watch which I 
wore; 
I 
of course satisfied her, and then conversation 
Was freely indulged in by both, till my brain 
Fairly reeled with excitement, I 
got so enchanted 
With the charming young widow I 
met on the 
train. 
(

TOM RUSSEL'S COMIC SONGS. 
We got so familiar I 
ventured to ask her 
how old was the baby she held at her breast? 
" 
Ali ! sir," she responded,—then into tears 
bursted,— 
And the infant still closer convulsively pressed; 
" 
When I 
think of my child I 
am nearly dis-
tracted, 
Its father! my husband! my heart breaks with 
pain." 
Then choking with sobs, leaned her head on my 
shoulder, 
This charming young widow I 
met on the 
train. 
By this time the train had arrived at the station, 
Within a 
few miles of the great bustling 
town, 
My fair one exclaimed, as she looked through the 
window, 
"Good gracious alive 1 
why, there goes Mr. 
Brown— 
Ire's my late husband's brother; dear sir, would 
you kindly 
My sweet darling child for a 
moment sus-
tain ?" 
Of course I 
complied ; then off on the platform 
Tripped the charming young widow I 
met on 
the train. 
Three minutes elapsed, when the signal-bell 
sounded, 
The cars began moving—no widow appeared; 
I 
cried out " Stop ! stop!" but they paid no at-
tention, 
But with a 
snort and a 
jerk, started off, as I 
feared; 
'Midst this horrid dilemma, I 
sought for the 
hour; 
My watch, it had vanished, and where was 
my chain ? 
TOM RUSSEL'S COMIC SONGS.

My purse, with my ticket, and gold pencil-case 
gone, sirs, 
And so was the widow I 
met on the train. 
While I 
my misfortune was deeply bewailing, 
The cars again stopped, and I " tickets please!" 
heard, 
I 
told the conductor, while dangling the infant, 
The loss I'd sustained, but he doubted my 
word ; 
He called more officials, the lot gathered round 
me; 
They uncovered the child, and how shall I 
explain, 
For behold 'twas no child, it was only a 
dummy; 
Oh! that swindling young widow I 
met on the 
train I 
Satisfied I'd been robbed, they allowed my de-
parture, 
'though of course I'd to settle my fare the 
next day. 
I 
now wish to counsel you men from the country, 
Mind you never get caught in a 
similar way; 
Beware of young widows you meet on the rail-
way, 
Who lean on your shoulder while tears fall 
like rain; 
Look out for your pockets, for fear they resemble 
That charming young widow I 
met on the 
train.

HIBERNIA'S FAMILY NAMES. 
ORIGINALLY WRITTEN FOR AND SUNG DT TOM RUSSEL WITH rN-
BOIJNDRD APPLAUSE. 
Air—Nell Flaherty's Drake. 
I RAVE heard some strange names, when through-
out the world roaming, 
For instance, the Foxes, the Lions, and Twigs, 
But Ould Ireland's the spot, where they lick all 
their neighbors, 
In witty effusions and comical rigs.. 
And their family names I 
will now give to you, 
I 
will trace them all back to old Brian Boru ; 
I 
will try to pronounce them, if you'll not de-
nounce them, 
Though ' twill give my small mouth a 
most 
terrible screw. 
Chorus. — There's the O'Farleys, O'Malleys, 
MeDermots, "MeNallys, 
The O'Briens, MeFaddens, the great 
Donohue, 
The O'Shan`nons, O'Lennins, O'Learys, 
0 ' Brennans, 
And the blackguards from Munster, 
which I 
belong to. 
There's the Brophys, the Murphys, the Lynches, 
the Clinches, 
The INIurdochs, the Burdochs, the Tyrones, 
the Sheils, 
The Meaghers, the Cahers, the Cahnls, the 
Clearys, 
The O'Shaunesees and the princely 0'.Neils, 
The Terenees, Barneys, the Bridgets, the Kear-
ney; 
The Pats, and the Larry; all of the right 
sort;

And, by jabers! I

Chorus.—There's the O'Farleys, &e. 
There's the Ilannans, the Gannans, the IIagans,

The Flagans, the Cragans, the Dillons, and 
Doyles,

And you may bet your sweet life, if you join in 
the strife, 
Their shillaleghs will split your thick heads 
quick in two.

TIIE SHAMROCK GREEN. 
COMPOSED FOR AND SUNG BY TOM RUSSEL. 
Air—Ivy Green. 
A 
BEAUTIFUL plant is the shamrock green, 
Which grows in the Isle of the West, 
Where its daughters are lovely, its sons they are 
brave, • 
And its pigs and potatoes the best; 
Where St. Patrick he landed and drove out the 
frogs, 
As charming as ever was seen, 
Where Brian Boru was the king of its bogs,* 
As he raised up his banner of green. 
Springing out of the ground ' tis seen,— 
A 
beautiful plant is the shamrock green. 
12 
TOM RUSSEL'S COMIC SONGS. 
''Tis the land where O'Connell and Emmett did 
live, 
Its history never shall fade; 
Though its sons o'er the waters are roaming 
afar, 
Yet its glory will never be dead : 
They'll always remember the land of their birth, 
Which once so powerful has been, 
Where Sarsfield he fought, and O'Brien he died 
In defence of the shamrock green. 
Springing out of the ground ' tis seen,— 
A beautiful plant is the shamroqk green. 
But soon the day of their freedom will come, 
When throughout the wide world it be said, 
To the sons of Old Erin, arise! in your might, 
And swift to the battle be led: 
Then her people shall gather from every clime, 
Where hiding in exile they've been, 
And raise in its glory the flag of the free, 
And fight for the shamrock green. 
Springing out of the ground ' tis seen,— 
A beautiful plant is the shamrock green.

GOOD folks, now attention pay to me, 
And I'll sing you a

In fact, as large as they ever was_made;

Now this is all truth that I 
tell you, 
For I'm one of the Horseshoe Brigade. 
Oh yes, you may believe my story, 
For through it I've made many a 
raid ; 
With the young ladies there I'm the darling, 
The pet of the Horseshoe Brigade. 
The ladies, the dear charming creatures, 
Are trying which most they can sell, 
And Rebecca does stand there so funny, 
A 
selling spruce pop from a 
well ; 
There's the temple of Solomon's mother! 
The petticoat Jeff Davis wore I 
The club with which Cain killed his brother, 
And a 
baby the ' What is it" bore. 
Oh yes, you may believe my story, &c. 
There's some Indians wild from the prairie, 
They're as drunk as can be every day, 
There's a 
lady with a 
wheel of fortune, 
Ten cents for three turns you must pay ; 
Which is cheap, as the times they are running, 
I 
never could get them for less, 
And this fair in Chicago, reducing 
The price, why, I 
ever shall bless. 
Oh yes, you may believe my story, &c. 
There's some brimstone was given by Satan, 
Who buys it with them ' twill go hard, 
There's a 
sermon by Henry Ward Beecher, 
The toe-nail of old Beauregard ; 
There's the egg by old Mother Goose laid, sirs, 
And that I 
should the queer story tell, 
Some feminines peddling some posies, 
And asking five cents for a 
smell. 
Oh yes, you may believe my story, & c. 
There's a 
letter by Washington written, 
The words are engraved on my heart, 
There's the banner was torn from Fort Sumter, 
Which a 
thrill to your soul will impart; 
14 
TOM RUSSEL'S COMIC SONGS. 
There's two ladies, God bless them for ever, 
To help the good cause here they came, 
May misfortune ne'er dawn on them, never, 
For Douglas and Sherman's the names. 
Oh yes, you may believe my story, & c. 
OH! IF I 
IIAD SOME ONE TO RUB ME. 
AS SUNG BF TOM RUSSEL. 
Air—Oh! If I 
had some one to love me. 
On! If I 
bad some one to rub me, 
These rheumatic pains to dispel, 
To warm with their exquisite friction, 
I 
think I 
in time should get well; 
Some lovely and blooming young creature, 
With heart just as soft as her hand, 
With a 
heavenly smile in each feature, 
And power and will at command. • 
Oh! If I 
had, & c. 
Oh! If I 
had some one to rub me, 
Ye fair ones, now what do you say? 
Depend upon it when I 
am better 
Your kindness and toil I'll repay; 
I'll dance any caper to measure, 
Each difficult step hasten through, 
And—really, my sweet fascinator, 
I 
cannot say what I 
would do. 
Oh! If I

GRANT'S STRATEGY. 
A 
Patriotic Sony. 
Air—No Irish need apply. 
WRITTEN FOR AND SUNG BY TOM RUSSET., WITH UNBOUNDED 
APPLAUSE. 
'TB of a 
noble soldier that now Pm going to 
sing, 
Let all the people join me, and his good praises 
ring ; 
For late he conquered Richmond, and loud the 
shout ascends, 
That Grant is our preserver, who the Union 
cause defends. 
Then run aloft the starry flag, let freedom be 
our cry, 
The man we want is General Grant, when 
once he does apply. 
He formed a 
circle round them, when he did 
march away, 
From Fredericksburg he went himself, 'twas an 
auspicious day; 
At Spottsylvania Court House, and through the 
Wilderness, 
lie boldly fought and conquered, let us all that 
hero bless. 
And run aloft the starry flag! till freedom be 
our cry, 
For he brought gold down to 30, when for 
Richmond he did try. 
He sent Sherman down to Georgia, a 
part of his 
great plan, 
Phil Sheridan to Shenandoah, how well he knew 
the man, 
16 
TOM RUSSEL'S COMIC. SONGS. 
Sent K 
ilpatrick off to skirmish, to make the 
nation free, 
Ben Butler home to Lowell, and Thomas to 
Tennessee. 
And the people all were satisfied, fur well 
they knew he'd try, 
And when a 
President we want, I'll bet he 
may apply. 
He made Lord Russell change his mind, Napo-
leon cease to blow, 
Made Maximilian tremble way down in •Mexico, 
For he said that we must conquer, and showed 
the reason why, 
And but late he did save Richmond, when ,to 
burn it they did try. 
But since the fighting's over, we'll once more 
peaceful be, 
Throw down the sword, take up the plough, 
and live for ever free. 
Let mercy reign within us, now the struggle it 
is o'er, 
And let us say to Johnny Reb, Go home and sin 
no more, 
We know you've battled bravely, but conquered 
now you be, 
Destroy your bars—embrace our stars, the em-
blem of the free. 
And raise the good old banner in triumph to 
the sky, 
And if other nations want to fight, we'll be 
there when they apply.

ALABAMA AND KRARSARGE. 
Air—Ragged Coat. 
COMPOSED EXPRESSLY FOR TOM RUSSEL, AND SUNG BY HIM FOR 
FIFTY NIGHTS. 
HATE you not heard the story of a 
great and 
glorious battle, 
Between two noble vessels one merry morn in 
June; 
When the Kearsarge at anchor lay down in the 
English Channel, 
With shotted guns, and men prepared to fight 
and meet their doom ? 
For in the harbor near by was the Alabama 
lying, 
And it was whispered 'mongst the crew she'd 
come out and tight to-day, 
So hoisted was the Stars and Stripes, our glorious 
banner flying 
To sink or win, but ne'er be struck, through-
out the coming fray. 
Come bravely out, bold Captain Semmes, come 
forth and give us battle, 
No more can you plunder the seas, or sink a 
weaker ship ; 
Come forth and show your colors, man, and let 
your cannon rattle, 
A Yankee boat and Yankee crew are here for 
you to whip: 
Just at this moment steaming came a 
vessel 
from the harbor, 
The Alabama! Winslow cried, now, boys, pre-
pare to fight, 
Think of your starry banner and dear Colum-
bia's glory, 
Shot well your guns, and silent be, and may 
God defend the right.

TOM RUSSEL'S COMIC SONGS. 
In circles nearer came the ships—' us soon you'll 
cease your vaunting, 
A noble boat, with crew as brave, are now 
your track upon, 
That pirate flag you'll have to lower—that flag 
so proudly flaunting, 
The Alabama's fate is sealed, her base career 
now done; 
And as a 
broadside struck the foe, a 
cheer to 
heaven ascending, 
Proclaimed that Freedom's cause had won, for 
sinking on our lea, 
The pirate vessel went below, a 
wretched cause 
defending, 
And Uncle Sam, as in days of yore, wa* 
monarch of the sea. 
NEVER LOOSE YOUR GRIP. 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY TOM RUSSEL. 
Air—Can't help that. 
NEW bywords you are sure to hear 
As through the streets you trip, 
The latest one that has come out, 
Is, Never loose your grip ; 
How strange it sounds, when it you hear, 
Yet ' tis what all are doing, 
When once a 
man lets go his hold, 
lie is sure to go to ruin. 
Chorus.—And now to all I 
wish to say, 
As through this world you trip, 
Be just to every one you meet, 
But never loose your grip. 
Long years ago, when we were young, 
John Bull he tried to come it, 
By sending tea here to our land, 
And putting taxes on it; 
TOM RUSSEL'S COMIC SONGS.

He soon found out it would not do, 
We wouldn't let it slip, 
We threw it overboard, that is, 
When John he lost his grip. 
Chorus. 
Napoleon thought our hands were tied, 
And nothing could we do, 
A 
first-rate chance, he thought, to build 
A throne in Mexico; 
But now our troubles settled, 
'We'll skirmish round a 
bit, 
I 
think, that very shortly Nap 
Will " kind a" loose his grip. 
Chorus. 
This war produced a 
host of men, 
Whose conduct was a 
shame, 
But some have done their duty, 
And have won a 
glorious name; 
When some they had it in their hands, 
They let the chances slip, 
But Grant has kept right straight ahead, 
lie never lost his grip. 
Chorus. 
Jeff Davis thought it mighty fine 
To be a 
president; 
He tried it, found it wouldn't pay, 
And now he does repent; 
We'll punish him, as you're alive, 
We ne'er can let him slip; 
If once a 
rope gets round his neck, 
'Twill never loose its grip. 
Chorus. 
As time goes on, we journey through 
This life with spirits gay, 
Old age comes creeping after us, 
And steals our strength away;

THE GOAT. 
AS SUNG BY TOM RUSSEL. 
Air—Old Gray Mare. 
Coon evening, my friends, I'm going to relate. 
And if you'll pay attention, you've not long to 
wait ; 
My father he lived at a 
place called Gramote, 
he'd a 
sow, and a 
pig, and a 
fine billy goat. 
Now this goat he had a 
most curious way, 
he'd go out in the morning and stay out all day; 
Then he'd come home at night, and like a 
bull 
he would roar, 
Till my father'd get up to open the door. 
One day we sat down and was going to eat, 
The goat jumped on the table and stole all the 
meat, 
And without saying a word, the big dirty 
" 
Gornach," 
Drove his two horns into my poor father's sto-
mach. 
Says my mother to me, " Tom?" Yes, ma'am, 
says I ; 
" 
Take the goat to the market, to sell him now 
try :" 
But the words she'd scarce spoke, when the goat 
gave a 
jump, 
Struck my mother behind a most murderous 
thump. 
Then all in the house beat a 
hasty retreat, 
But the goat bucked away at the devil's own 
rate, 
lie spied my father's coat hanging up in the 
hall, 
lie charged on the tail, and drove his head 
through the wall. 
Some time after that we went to look for the 
goat, 
We searched all around till we came to the coat; 
All of him that was left on the very next day, 
Was the stump of a 
tail, and he bucking away. 
TIIE PRESIDENT'S BALL. 
AS SUNG BY TOM RUSSEL. 
Air—Lanigan's Ball. 
A CURIOUS story I'm now going to tell you, 
If but for a 
moment you'll listen to me, 
Concerning a 
hop down in Washington City, 
Which was visited lately by Greeley and me; 
'Twas a 
dance that was given by swate Andy 
Johnson, 
At which Charley Sumner the figures did call, 
While me, Garibaldi, and Barnum's What is it ? 
Did form the first set at the President's Ball. 
There was " Jigadier Brinerals" and shoddy 
contractors, 
There was senators, nobles, to count by the 
score, 
But not a 
brave private with medal upon him, 
Amongst the gay crowd could be seen on the 
floor; 
There was Mr. Lord Lyons, and old Maximilian 
A-trying to steal Mrs. Johnson's new shawl, 
22 
TOM RUSSEL'S COMIC SONGS. 
While Chase with his greenbacks, what do you 
think he was " arter" ? 
Inventing a 
tax at the President's Ball. 
Long John and Toni Thumb, the tall and the 
short of it, 
A-telling big yarns at the back of the door, 
While Stanton was studying, a 
map of this city, 
To find could he draft it a 
few thousands more; 
There was Welles and the devil, designing a 
gunboat, 
To be built in a 
week, which would not float 
at all, 
While Blair in a 
side room was doing a 
big 
thing, 
Confiscating the spoons at the President's Ball. 
There was old Beauregard and his friend Wen-
dell Phillips, 
Discussing a 
dodge for to bring about peace, 
While Miles O'Reilly, a 
Frenchman and poet, 
Was trying at poker the ladies to fleece; 
There was Edwin Forrest, the great Bull of 
Bashful, 
At least it is so him the papers do call, 
lie was shaking his fist at Jimmy Buchanan , 
For talking divorce case at the President's 
B 
all. 
But soon we found out the morning was breaking, 
The policeman on duty for Fremont did call, 
For Greeley's white hat he had put in his pocket, 
They were all on the make at the President's 
Ball ; 
A 
general rumpus it finished the evening, 
The provost-marshal came in and he kicked 
out us all, 
They carried me dead drunk home on a 
stretcher, 
And that put an end to the President's Ball!

Parody, 
COMPOSED EXPRESSLY FOR AND SUNG BY TOM RUSSEL, WITH IM-
MENSE APPLAUSE. 
Air—The Old Sexton. 
NIGH to a 
grave, what was newly made, 
Stood a 
sexton drinking, he made it a 
trade, 
His bottle was empty, and he paused to wait 
The funeral train at the churchyard gate; 
A 
relic of mean, bad liquor was he, 
For bloated he was, as bloated could be, 
Still these words came from his lips so thin, 
A 
little more gin! a

Gin! Gin! a

When the funeral came, the sexton swore 
They might die and be , 
but he'd bury no 
more. 
Then he struck all the mourners that stood 
around, 
Till a 
Donnybrook fair seemed the burial ground; 
And off he tottered to get a 
drop, 
To a 
Dutchman's basement, where cheap stuff 
could be got, 
And these words came from his lips so thin, 
A

THE IRISII 
AS SUNG BY TOM RUSSEL, IVITII GREAT APPLAUSE. 
I'm a 
joiner by trade, and O'Chisel's my name, 
From the sod, to make shavings and money I 
came,

TOM RUSSEL'S COMIC SONGS. 
But myself I 
was never concerning, 
About the lessons of sehools, 
For my own chest of tools 
And my shop were a 
college of learning. 
Ciorus.—For by cutting, contriving, and boring. 
and driving, 
Each learned profession gets bread ; 
And they're sure ta succeed, if they 
only take heed 
To strike the right nail on the head. 
The lawyers, like carpenters, work on a " bench," 
And their trade's just the same as my own to an 
inch, 
For clients whenever they dive in it, 
Soon find their cash fail, 
For the law's a 
big " nail," 
And the attorneys the hammers for driving it. 
Chorus.—For by cutting, &c. 
The doctor a 
big chest of tools carries out. 
And cuts, saws, and hacks his poor patients 
about, 
Just as I 
would a 
plank or a 
scantling; 
And it's all one to him, 
If he lops off a 
limb, 
Or takes out a 
young tooth or young bantling. 
Citorus.—For by cutting, & c. 
Then each Sunday at church by the parson 
we're told, 
By line, square, and compass, our actions to 
mould." 
And at joining" himself the right sort is ; 
For he 
pins" man and wife 
Together for life, 
Just as firm as a 
tenon and mortice. 
Chorus.—For by cutting, & c. 
TOM RUSSEL'S COMIC SONGS. 
25 
And the heroes that serve in our armies and 
ships, 
When they're fighting our battles, are all brother 
" 
chips," 
So entirely our trades are according; 
For with tools of sharp steel, 
Soldiers cut a 
good " deal," 
And the tars are neat workmen at " boarding." 
Chorus.—For by cutting, &c. 
Then our statesmen and merchants, and stock-
jobbing lads, 
Like joiners, work best when they've plenty of 
" 
brads," 
Each projector's a 
great " undertaker ;" 
And to " clinch" up the whole, 
Andy, bless his soul, 
is an elegant " cabinet maker." 
Chorus.—For by cutting, &c. 
TIIE FIGIITING IRISII BOY. 
Air—Finnegan's Wake. 
I'm a 
ranting Irish boy, 
Fond of whiskey, love, and fun, 
To box and fight is my delight, 
And from a 
foe I'll never run; 
And, when the war broke out one day, 
For a 
soldier bold I 
did enlist, 
And marched away in grand array, 
With a 
blunderbuss stuck in my fist. 
Chorus. 
lloroo! for the fighting Irish boy! 
The tearing, swearing, Irish boy! 
The ranting, roaring, screaming, boring, 
Thumping, lump of an Irish boy!

TOM RUSSEL'S COMIC SONGS. 
And when we reached the seat of war, 
The enemy did us attack, 
But I " slapt" at them left and right, 
And " stopt" their army in a 
crack; 
The commander gave the word to charge, 
And on the foe we made a 
rush, 
And thousands fell each side pellmell, 
From the fire of my terrible blunderbuss. 
Chorus. 
Sound retreat, we are surely beat, 
Says Beauregard to his brigadiers, 
It is no use, he said, of fighting 
With the Irish volunteers: 
They threw away their arms and fled, 
While in their rear I 
close did push; 
Run, run, ye devils, every one, 
Here comes wild Pat with his blunderbuss 
Chorus. 
THE FEMALE CONTRABAND.

Air—The Cure. 
Ou golly! Oh dear! I 
feel so queer, 
I 
don't know what to do, 
Ise just come out to sing a 
song, 
And I 
hope it will please you; 
The abolitionists raised a 
fuss, 
And yet they aint content, 
Although they know as well as I, 
Free Niggers aint worth a 
cent. 
Chorus. 
Now white folks all, both great and small, 
I 
want you to understand, 
Ise Phebianna Brown, 
The female contraband.

As Massa Douglas said one day, 
In Denmark something's rotten, 
No wonder when they try to take 
The wool away from cotton; 
If ould Nick he had Ward Beecher, 
Horace Greeley and such men, 
It's the opinion of this Nigger Wench, 
Times would soon be good again. 
Chorus. 
White folks, I 
wish you all good-bye, 
I 
guess I've said enough, 
They talk about their black brigade, 
And all that kind of stuff; 
When freedom comes, I 
hope they'll work, 
If to only till the land, 
More kicks than half-pence they will get, 
The happy contraband. 
Chorus. 
THE MIRACULOUS TONGUE. 
Air—Cork Leg. 
A 
VERY notorious piece of work, 
A wonderful leg that was made of cork, 
But now you will see by the song I 
have planned, 
It isn't a 
leg I 
have got in my hand. 
Chorus.—Right tural lu, & c. 
One Jonathan Glib had a 
scolding wife, 
Whose termagant tongue was the pest of his 
life, 
lie consulted a 
conjuror how to allay her. 
But she couldn't be soothed, even by a 
sooth-
sayer. 
Chorus.—Right tural lu, &c. 
28 
TOM RussEr:s COMIC SONGS. 
Said the sage, your misfortunes must not be en-
dured, 
For a 
scolding wife can never be cured, 
But if you are inclined her steps to follow, 
I'll give you a 
tongue that shall beat her all 
hollow. 
Chorus.—Right tural lu, &c. 
This tongue it answered remarkably well, 
This man got a 
clapper that silenced his belle, 
But soon to his cost, the unfortunate elf, 
Found out that he never could silence himself. 
Chorus.—Right tural lu, &c. 
Upon any subject he ne'er found a 
lack, 
For, all about nothing for hours would clack, 
It was just like a 
river whose banks couldn't 
prop it, 
For tho' you might dam it, you never could stop 
it. 
Chorus.—Right tural lu, Scc. 
To him was talking both meat and drink, 
Of his latter days he had no time to think, 
But he wore out his lungs, and grew so ill, 
That he died, and his tongue kept wagging still. 
Chorus.—Right tural lu, &c. 
his friends attended his grave in a 
throng, 
In hopes that death had silenced his tongue, 
But he swore, as the mutes were asking for pelf, 
He be 
if ever he'd be mute himself. 
Chorus.—Bight tural lu, & e. 
He talked to' the sexton, he talked to the clerk, 
lie talked to the mourners, as gay as a 
lark, 
And the parson by whom he should be interred, 
Gave it up, for he couldn't get in a 
word. 
Chorus.—Right tural lu, & c. 
TOM RUSSEL'S COMIC SONGS.

In the midst of his story, as nothing could stop 
him, 
Snug under the turf they managed to pop him, 
But tho' on his head they piled a 
mound, 
lie went on with his tale while under the ground. 
Chorus.—Right tural lu, & c. 
How long he kept talking ' tis hard to say, 
But the grave was opened the other day, 
And the skull was all that remained of the dead, 
But the teeth kept chattering yet in his head. 
Chorus.—Right tural lu, 
TOM'S TRIP TO BARNUM'S RIG SHOW. 
Air—Nora Creina. 
AS WRITTEN FOR AND SUNG BY TOM RUSSEL. 
ONE day I 
thought I'd have a 
spree, 
To Barnum's I 
would pay a 
visit, 
To see the wonders of the place, 
The Fat Boy and the great What Is it! 
And if you'll listen to my song, 
I 
will describe what I 
saw in it, 
That is, just as the showman said, 
And this is the way he did begin it— 
Chorus.—Oh ! 
I'm the boy for joke and fun, 
Ever gay, and ever frisky, 
I 
scorn the man dislikes a 
pun, 
And would not live on love and 
whiskey. 
Now, that is John the Baptist's nose, 
And that's the ghost of hamlet's mother, 
That's the pillow which Othello used, 
When he did Desdemona smother; 
3* 
30 
TOM RUSSEL'S COMIC SONGS. 
That's the dagger which Macbeth thought he 
saw, 
When he the king was going to slaughter, 
And when here, the Prince of Wales did wash, 
And that's a 
bottle of his water. 
Chorus. 
Now, that's a 
tear from Tommy's eye, 
The pet of the Japanese embassy, 
A 
drop of blood from IIeenan's nose, 
The eye tooth of old Jemmy Massey. 
That's the coat-tail of old Beauregard, 
Who has proved himself a 
perfect ninny, 
And that's the skull of Governor Wise, 
The " darndest" fool in all Virginny. 
Chorus. 
There's some rotten pork from Libby jail, 
A 
ball and chain from Castle Thunder, 
The petticoat Jeff Davis wore, 
When he committed his last blunder; 
A peck of dust from Sherman's march, 
When he through Georgia fast was going, 
The bright sword of Phil Sheridan, 
With which he stopped the Rebels' blowing. 
Chorus; 
Now, Barnum's got the rummiest things 
Which ever you did clap your eyes on, 
lie has Mrs. Tom Thumb's baby there, 
As its mammy's lap the sweet thing lies on ; 
But the funniest thing in all the lot, 
Excepting perhaps the " Quaker" cannon, 
He has got perched up there, in a 
cage, 
That nondescript, old Jim Buchanan! 
Chorus.

UNLIKELY THINGS. 
Air—Dicky Birds. 
ARRANGED EXPRESSLY FOR AND SUNG BY TOM RUSSEL. 
WnAr curious occasions happen every day, 
Fresh wonders spring up every hour, and old 
ones pass away, 
But the most unlikely things are those, and let 
them prate who will, 
My aim is now a 
song of things that's more un-
likely still. 
Fol de dol, &c. 
Now, is it likely any man will act just like a 
pup, 
By tumbling o'er a 
greenback, and refuse to 
pick it up ? 
Or is it likely at a 
fair—it matters not how gay, 
A 
thief would steal your watch, and then forget 
to get away? 
Fol de dol, &c. 
Now, is it likely any maid will act like those of 
yore, 
And take her bustle from behind, and wear it 
down before ? 
Or is it likely you will see a 
new policeman shy, 
Or say he would not have a 
game at a 
good 
thing on the sly ? 
Fol de dol, &c. 
Now, is it likely you will see Andy Johnson 
driving hogs, 
Or poor old sleepy Gideon Welles do a 
dance 
with wooden clogs ? 
Or is it likely you will see a 
mackerel kiss a 
salmon, 
Or ever see a 
codfish dance a 
jig with Jim 
Buchanan ? 
Fol de dol, &c. 
32 
TOM RUSSEL'S COMIC SONGS. 
Now, is it likely any man would think it proper 
or right 
To see his dear and lawful wife with another 
man at night ? 
And is it likely, if he found her out, she would 
not have to run, 
Or say it was her mother's, brother's, sister's, 
cousin's son ? 
Fol de do!, &c. 
Now, is it likely friends come here with nothing 
to admire, 
Or is it likely I 
can sing all night, and never 
tire? 
But if it's likely you are pleased, it's likely I 
am 
right, 
And it's likely I 
will sing on likely things some 
other night. 
Fol de dol, 86c. 
RUSSEL'S VISIT TO THE CHICAGO MU-
SEUM. 
COMPOSED EXPRESSLY FOR TOM RUSSET., AND SUNG LT RIM WITH 
GREAT APPLAUSE. 
Air—Marching on. 
ONE day I 
went to Wood's to see each comic 
sight, 
I 
wandered through the building from morning 
until night, 
And the funny things which I 
saw there, they 
gave me much delight, 
As I 
went walking round. 
TOM RUSSEL'S COMIC SONGS. 
33 
They charged me a 
quarter when I 
did enter in, 
They told me the performance was a-going to 
begin, 
And if I 
wished to be in time I'd better then 
walk in, 
And pay my money down. 
Chorus.—Oh but Wood he is a 
rum one, 
Oh! the Colonel is a 
queer one, 
Oh! but Wood he is a 
rum one, 
And keeps a 
great big show. 
The first thing which struck me as being rather 
queer, 
Was a 
fortune-telling lady drinking down a 
• quart of beer, 
With a 
man with whiskers five feet long, cover-
ing him both front and rear, 
As I 
went walking round. 
And then a 
big fat woman was the next thing I 
did see, 
Winking her eye at Green the dwarf—a 
comio 
sight for me; 
But Wood says the show is moral, and with him 
we must agree, 
As he goes walking round. 
Chorus. 
A drama in the lecture-room to morality does 
tend, 
With two murders and a 
suicide it generally 
does end; 
But, then, Colonel Wood's religious, and to vir-
tue is a 
friend, 
As he goes walking round. 
The Temple of old Solomon, some men who 
glass will blow, 
34 
TOM RUSSET'S COMIC SONGS. 
Some monkeys in a 
big cage, where ladies fine 
will go, 
To see old Jock° sport himself, and show what 
we all know, 
As we go marching round. 
Chorus. 
The figure of Pontius Pilate, with a 
face just 
like a 
Mick 
The mummy of old Moses, enough to turn you 
sick, 
A Chicago beauty made of wax, from Ireland 
dear avick, 
As you go walking round. 
Some large stuffed birds within a 
box, a 
glass 
case full of stones, 
A 
lot of snakes with dirty skins, a 
coffin full of 
bones, 
An empty treasury on wet days, at which the 
Colonel groans, 
As he goes marching round. 
Chorus. 
When I 
thought I'd got my money's worth, I 
turned to the right about, 
The lady what's invisible I 
think she had gone 
out, 
And the million curiosities looked as though 
they'd just come down the spout, 
As I 
went walking round. 
They say Barnum is a 
humbug, but I 
wish it 
understood 
Our western showman's cleverness I 
think is 
just as good; 
And he's a 
fit match for old Satan who can 
swindle Colonel Wood, 
When he goes walking round. 
Chorus.

STAMP ACT. 
BUNG BY TOM RUSSEL, WITH UNBOUNDED ENTHUSIASM. 
Air—Bow, wow, wow. 
KIND gentlemen, just list to me, 
A 
song I'm going to sing to you, 
And if you will attention pay, 
The truth I'll try and bring to you; 
'Tis of an act that's all the rage 
In this part of creation, 
For they put a 
stamp on everything 
They get in this great nation. 
Chorus.—Oh! yes indeed tis so, 
The stamp act now is all the go, 
And that you'll find is so. 
There's stamps on drugs and groceries, 
On tin pans, pots, and kettles, 
On jewelry and crockery ware, 
And even on your victuals; 
There's stamps as well on hardware too, 
On door knobs, bells, and latches, 
And they even put a 
penny stamp 
On every box of matches. 
Chorus. 
There's stamps on liquors and cigars, 
And things that make life happy, 
And all your children must be stamped, 
Ere they can call you pappy; 
There's stamps upon your cake and pie, 
On pitcher, pan, and bowl, sirs, 
And if a 
man should chance to die, 
They want to stamp his soul, sirs. 
Chorus. 
36 
TOM RUSSEL'S COMIC SONGS. 
There's stamps on lumber, bricks, and nails, 
On dry goods, and on laces, 
There's stamps on Southern cotton bales, 
And on the ladies' faces; 
There's stamps on little children's dolls, 
That scarce can whisper mamma, 
And Sherman went and put a 
stamp 
On a 
place they call Savannah. 
Chorus. 
There's stamps on all we eat and drink, 
On coal oil and on shoddy, 
And 'twixt you and me I 
really think 
The next they'll stamp our body; 
This war has stamped this nation 
As the greatest in the world, sirs, 
And our banner will respected be, 
Whene'er it is unfurled, sirs. 
Chorus.

Some new one you will hear; 
Now, the latest, on my word,

Is the one you all have heard, 
You talk too much with your mouth.

A 
fellow goes to see 
The girl he does admire, 
lie sets her on his knee, 
Close by the kitchen fire ; 
Ile calls her his duck and dear, 
And tells her she's no sloth, 
But kind sir, says she, I 
fear 
You talk too much with your mouth. 
Chorus. 
There was old Beauregard, 
With all his traitor crew, 
They tried so mighty hard 
To put our soldiers through ; 
They swore we ne'er should plant 
Our starry flag down South, 
But since they met brave Grant, 
They don't talk so much with their mouth. 
Chorus. 
I 
went one night to hear 
The great George Francis Train, 
I 
hope I 
may be kicked 
If ever I 
go again; 
I 
thought he would ne'er get through, 
And let the people out, 
George Francis is a 
lightning train, 
But he talks too much with his mouth. 
Chorus. 
Now, one brave man I'll name, 
Whom all of you do know, 
Bold Grant, so full of game, 
Who has struck the latest blow ; 
For, without loud talk or noise, 
lie took Richmond from the South, 
Now Grant is one of the boys, 
And he talks with the cannon's mouth. 
Chorus.

AS SUNG BY TOM RUSSEL. 
AT

We passed the hours with a

For each person sung in novel style; 
The brandy warm and cold without, 
Went pretty freely round about, 
The Chairmaker kindly took the chair, 
And then the Blacksmith took his beer ;

But with a

The Bellringer sang " The Evening Chimes," 
And the Editor " Rhymes upon the Times," 
The Joiner sang " The Old Arm Chair," 
But, being hoarse, failed in the air; 
The Turner turned " Upon the Hill," 
And the Fighting man he sang the " Mill," 
The Undertilker sang " The Mute," 
And the lawyer sang " The Faded Suit," 
The Printer pressed the times, and gave 
A song he called " The Galley Slave,"

He gave a

And " The Snob's Confession" gave us too,

The Gardener sang " The Cabbage Green," 
And the Company all, " We've happy been."

The Concert opened at set of sun; 
So off to bed we all did roam, 
And after supper sang " Home, sweet Home."

HER LAST DODGE HAUNTS ME STILL. 
AS WRITTEN FOR AND SUNG BY TOM RUSSEL. 
Air—Her bright smile haunts me still. 
GOOD folks, attention pay 
To the story of my wrung, 
It was once tried on me, 
What I'll mention in my song; 
The gal I'm married to, 
She has proved a 
bitter pill, 
Every fancy game she tries,. 
But her last dodge haunts me still. 
For she got me once to go, 
-Where they put me thro' the mill, 
And she snapped the bounty all, 
That last dodge haunts me still. 
Of course I 
jumped away, 
And I 
boldly made a 
dash 
To the charming gal at home, 
With my little bit of cash; 
But joy from me is fled, 
There she was with cousin Bill, 
Of course I 
punched his head, 
But her last dodge haunts me still. 
I 
could stand even that, 
But she ran me up a 
bill, 
And she pawned my clothes and hat, 
Her last dodge haunts me still. 
Now I 
can't enlist again, 
For our boys the rebs did kill, 
So I 
must start a 
bank, 
Or else go rob a 
till; 
For here I''am dead broke, 
She's off again with Bill, 
Can I 
not break the yoke, 
For her last dodge haunts me still.

If I

The false one I 
will kill, 
By knocking out her brains, 
For her last dodge haunts me still. 
SHAKSPEARE'S CELEBRATED TRAGE-
DIES. 
AS EXPRESSLY WRITTEN FOR AND SUNG BY TOM RUSSEL. 
Now, good folks, attention pay, 
While a 
story I'll begin it, 
Mr. William Shakspeare told it me, 
As I 
will tell you in a 
minute; 
lie murders kings and queens, 
Every night upon the stage, sirs, 
And I'll describe the plays 
Which now are all the rage, sirs. 
[Spoken.] Ladies and Gentlemen*: If you will 
go upon a 
voyage of discovery with me and Mr. 
William Shakspeare, in a 
few minutes we will 
make the tour of Europe and America, picking 
up our little plots upon the way. 
We will start 
from the home of lager beer and Switzer cheese 
—Denmark. 
Now, Mr. Hamlet was a 
Dutch prince, 
He sparked the chamberlain's daughter, 
She fell into a 
ditch, 
And went to heaven by water; 
His father poisoned was, 
By his uncle and his mother, 
Which caused his daddy's ghost 
To kick up such a 
bother. 
Fol did lol dol la, &c., &c.

We will now proceed on our journey, and 
make our next stopping-place at the British 
Isles, or, at least, at one peculiar portion of them 
called Scotland, of which this is said to be the 
national emblem—" God bless the Duke of Ar-
gyle." 
Now, Mr. Macbeth was a 
Scotch king, 
Into Duncan's room did stagger, 
Where he cut off his nose 
With the sharp point of his dagger; 
But one night in a 
cave 
lie was frightened by three witches, 
They showed him Banquo's sons; 
And he called them—( you know what). 
Fol did lol dol la, &c., &c., 
We will again continue our perambulations— 
his time stopping for a 
few moments in Italy, 
the land of poetry and song. 
This is said to be 
Mr. Shakspeare's original conception of the love 
business. 
Now, Mr. Romeo was an Italian fool, 
Miss Juliet he did love her, 
But her papa and ma 
Into a 
tomb did shove her; 
Where she did poison take ( in front), 
And laid her down and died, sirs, ' 
While Romeo stabbed himself ( behind)

THE BASHFUL YOUTH. 
AS SUNG BY TOM RUSSEL, 
Air—The Quilting Party. 
M Y 
friends', I'll tell you here to-night 
A 
plain, unvarnished story ; 
It's not about my real estate, 
My health, or martial glory: 
Some people brag about their sense, 
Altho' their heads with trash full ; 
But I'll confess my weakness is, 
In beinr, so very bashful. 
- 
Cho
rus .— So pity me my miseries, 
All caused by being bashful. 
In childhood's days I 
got along, 
Like most all other babies ; 
My figure, face, and all I'd got, 
• Was worshipped by the ladies ; 
But when I 
had the measles then, 
My form was all with rash full, 
They examined all my hidden charms ; 
From that hour I 
was bashful. 
Chorus.—Believe me, ' twas those lady friends 
That just made me so bashful. 
In my youth, at school, I 
wasn't smart, 
I 
couldn't come the grammar, 
For verbs, and nouns, and adjectives, 
Would always make me stammer ; 
The master was a 
cross old chap, 
His head was with the lash full, 
he'd wallop me with my breeches down, 
Though he knew that I 
was bashful. 
Chonts.—By Jove! I 
think you'd felt like me, 
Not only hurt, but bashful. 
As I 
grew up, the girls came round, 
And tried to give me boldness, 
Their kisses, winks, and naughty looks, 
Showed anything but coldness ; 
They'd ask me for ice-cream and pop, 
They thought I 
was with cash full. 
They'd stuff their precious bellies full; 
Pm ' darned" if they were bashful. 
Chorus.—Andifyou'd have known that lot of 
girls,  
You'd have sworn they were not bash-
ful.

Oh, fie ! you're not so bashful."

Excuse me ' cause I'm bashful. 
SOLDIER AND SAILOR. 
AS WRITTEN FOR AND SUNG BY TOM RUSSEL. 
Air— Cruelty to Johnny. 
A 
SOLDIER and a 
sailor in Washington did meet, 
To discuss the Nation's troubles while standing 
on the street; 
They had not met before since the war it first 
began, 
So the soldier thought he'd take a 
drink—said 
the sailor, Amen. 
They refreshed themselves with lager, and then 
began to chat ; 
Said the soldier to the sailor, " What can the 
folks be at ? 
Why don't they summon Grant, my boy, he's 
worth of generals ten ? 
And the devil can knock out of Jeff"— said the 
sailor, Amen. 
When this cruel war is over, another one you'll 
see, 
A million Fenians they will sail, to make a 
nation free ;

And those who don't wish them success, and 
wave the green flag then, 
May they be starved by tyrants too 
said the 
sailor, Amen. 
There's a 
prison down in Richmond we must 
have in our grasp, 
The hand of some brave soldiers there I'd give 
my life to clasp, 
The cruelties they practise are loathed by every 
man; 
But— well, we'll pay them back some day—said 
the sailor, Amen. 
They have started a 
new doctrine, to do the 
country good, 
They call it Miscegenation; or, a 
mixing of the 
blood ; 
But coffee-colored children, or my wife a 
black-

Don't suit the taste of this here child—said the 
sailor, Amen.

But, if you'll give attention, I 
will tell without 
delay . 
How a 
buxom little damsel my affections led 
astray, 
And promised for to marry me upon the first of 
May, 
And left me with a 
bunch of water-cresses. 
'Twas on the first of April when I 
arrived in 
town, 
And, being quite a 
stranger, I 
wandered up and 
down, 
Until I 
lost myself entirely—I 
cannot tell you 
where— 
But ' twas in a 
very quiet street, the corner of a 
square; 
A neatly-dressed young woman came walking 
down the way ; 
As long as I 
remember, I 
shall ne'er forget the 
day, 
For she promised for to marry me upon the first 
of May, 
And she left me with a 
bunch of water-cresses. 
Politely I 
addressed her, and thus to her did 
say: 
" 
I 
wish to find the post-office; can you direct 
the way ?" 
" 
Oh. yes, sir! oh, yes, sir!" she speedily replied, 
-"fake the turning on the left, then go down 
.the other side." 
Her voice it was the sweetest I 
ever yet did 
hear 
In her hand, which, like the lily, was so very 
white and clear, 
She'd a 
bunch of early onions and a 
glass of 
lager- beer, 
Some pickles, and a 
bunch of water-cresses.

I 
bowed and I 
thanked her, and walked by her 
side, 
I 
thought how well she'd look as a 'Western 
farmer's bride; 
I 
gathered resolution, half in earnest, half in 
joke, 
I 
went up to the damsel, and thus to her I 
spoke : 
" 
I've a 
farm of sixty acres, I've horses, euws, 
and geese, 
Besides, I 
have a 
dairy filled with butter, milk, 
and cheese ; 
Will you marry me and mistress be, fair lady, 
of all these, 
And we'll pass our days on love and water-
crosses ?" 
She replied, with a 
smile, or a 
leer, if you choose. 
" 
You are so very generous, I 
cannot well refuse, 
S,) give me your direction, and I 
will without 
delay 
Prepare for matrimony, to love, honor, and obey: 
I've a 
wedding-dress to buy, and some little 
bills to pay." 
I 
handed her a 
sovereign, expenses to defray, 
And she promised for to marry me upon the first 
of May, 
'When she left me with a 
bunch of water-crosses. 
Next day a 
letter I 
received, and read there with 
surprise: 
•• Dear sir, for disappointing you, I

ANGELINA BROWN. 
AS SUNG BY TOM RUSSEL. 
I'm, tell you what befell me once, 
If yon will list awhile ; 
And when you've heard my tale, no doubt, 
At my troubles you will smile : 
I 
once went down to the Lake shore, 
Left my wife up in town, 
And fell in love with such a 
dove, 
Miss Angelina Brown. 
I 
so often to the Lake shore went, 
My wife began to stare, 
So I 
told her that the doctor 
Advised me change of air; 
She said I 
was quite well enough, 
Began to pout and frown, 
But little thought that I 
should meet 
With Angelina Brown. 
One day, while walking by the shore, 
This girl I 
there did meet— 
Oh, such a 
duck! and when I 
spoke, 
She answered me so sweet ; 
And when I 
asked her for her name, 
She did not give a 
frown, 
But answered, Well, sir, if you please, 
It's Angelina Brown. 
Now, with this dove I'd fell in love, 
For I 
met her every day ; 
When tired of strolling near the lake, 
We'd commence to fool and play; 
I 
had nought to fear from Sarah Jane, 
Who was minding shop in town, 
So, by Jove, I 
led a 
jolly life 
With Angelina Brown. 
Now, along the shore, one morning, 
I 
proposed to take a 
walk; 
And as we strolled along the beach, 
Conversed in loving talk; 
But on coming back the same way, 
To my horror I 
soon found 
The waters gathering round me 
And Miss Angelina Brown. 
The waves soon overtook us— 
Oh, crikey-1 such a 
mess, 
I 
seized a 
parasol, and waved 
A 
signal of distress ; 
But ere a 
boat could reach us, 
I 
feared that we should drown, 
For I 
couldn't keep my legs—no more 
Could Angelina Brown. 
Up rose the water faster, 
Poor Angelina cried, 
When, to my joy unbounded, 
A 
little boat I 
spied ; 
I 
waved my signal wildly, 
The boat on us bore down, 
But just in time to save myself 
And Angelina Brown. 
Half-drowned, they dragged us in the boat, 
Near frightened out of life, 
And landed us on shore, where, 
To my horror, stood my wife ; 
She looked fit to burst with passion, 
And I 
looked such a 
clown 
So I 
bolted off and left her 
With Angelina Brown. 
P,A1

TOM RUSSEL'S COMIC SONGS. 
So you see I 
got a 
damper, 
As well as nearly drowned ; 
Since then, to purchase quietness, 
It's cost me many a 
pound; 
My wife, she now is sinister, 
- 
And if I 
dare but frown, 
I'm crushed if she but mentions 
" 
Miss Angelina Brown." 
So, married men, take my advice, 
And mind what you're about, 
You'll find it true, whate'er you do, 
Your wife will find you out ;. 
Remember how I've suffered, 
And if to Lake walks you go down, 
Just mind you're not bowled out like me 
With Angelina Brown.

With sister Jane they tucked me up 
All snugly every night, 
A

I 
almost died with fright. 
And when I 
grew a 
bigger boy, 
My heart dwelt in my throat, 
For little boys would pull my nose, 
And call me petticoat; 
And when I 
whimpered, said I 
was 
(Laughing with all their might), 
A 
coward, and a 
poltroon too, 
Who didn't dare to fight. 
I 
always hated soldier men, 
And could not bear to see 
Them marching round with sword and gun', 
As grand as grand could he; 
And when they fired their cannons off, 
I 
almost died with fright, 
I 
was a 
coward and poltroon, 
And couldn't think of fight. 
And now I've grown to man's estate, 
At least I 
have in size, 
I'm very weak, and never let 
My angry passions rise; 
My wife she scolds, and cuffs my ears, 
But I 
don't mind one mite, 
For I'm a 
coward and poltroon, 
While she is full of fight. 
If drafted I 
should chance to be, 
I 
wouldn't fight—I 
couldn't run, 
But, like a 
lump of misery, 
I'd die and make no sign ; 
The thought would scare me half to death, 
The noise would kill me quite 
For I'm a 
coward and poltroon, 
And do not want to fight.

Of the boys who fought for Uncle Sam ?

Our banner is unfurled, 
I 
will bear it through the world, 
And plant it firmly on the Rio Grande. 
IIIS FATIIER WAS A CONGRESSMAN IN 
MILWAUKEE. 
Air—Gingham Umbrella. 
W HEN you hear my version 
Of a 
trip by cheap excursion, • 
Going to Milwaukee to spend the day; 
In the car where I 
did ride, 
A gent sat by my side, 
Who was very sweet upon me the whole of the 
day; 
Pardon me, said he, your name, pray, miss, 
I 
told him mine, and he told me his 
'Twas Augustus Albert Harry! 
An eye-glass he did carry, 
And his father was a 
congressman from Mil-
waukee. 
We talked about the weather, 
And one thing or the other, 
The time passed away so very pleasantly; 
A 
biscuit and some wine 
I 
thought I'd not decline, 
Which he so very kindly did offer to me; 
He told me his father was a 
congressman, 
his uncle was a 
general, a 
very popular man. 
Then Augustus Albert Harry 
Asked me if I 
would marry, 
And live upon his country-seat in Milwaukee. 
I 
blushed, I 
must confess, 
My hand he so did press, 
• 
I 
scarcely could tell what to do or say; 
TOM RUSSEL'S COMIC SONGS. 
63 
With his arm around my waist, 
In a 
whisper I 
said, Yes! 
We then agreed and settled upon the wedding-
day. 
Then a 
station we did near and when the cars 
did stop, 
I 
felt all over funny as the question he did pop; 
To think that I 
should marry 
Augustus Albert Harry! 
And live upon his country-seat in Milwaukee. 
We had scarcely left the station, 
When guess my consternation, 
I 
missed my brooch, my gold watch and chain; 
I 
searched everywhere, 
When Albert said, My dear, 
I'm sure you must have left it behind in the 
train; 
A man then came up, saying, How do you do ? 
Tapped him on the shoulder—A moment, 
please, with you; 
Not longer did he tarry, 
But handcuffed Augustus Harry, 
For being a 
bounty-jumper from Milwaukee! 
ON TO MEXICO. 
WRITTEN EXPRESSLY FOR AND SUNG BY TOM RUSSEL. 
Air — J 
eannette and Jeannot. 
W E 
are marching boldly onward, we are march-
ing,swift along, 
The gallant Union army, some fifty thousand 
strong, 
To defend a 
nation's freedom, and defeat a f
o-
reign foe, 
To preserve the Monroe doctrine on the plains 
of Mexico; 
64 
Tom RUSSEL'S COMIC SONGS. 
With our bayonets brightly gleaming, with our 
sabres by our side, 
Each man has battled bravely, and secession's 
cause defied ; 
And as we beat the traitors in the late Confede-
rate war, 
We'll prevent old Maximilian from dimming a 
single star. 
If Sherman will but lead us, the fight will soon 
be o'er, 
And we'll hear no more of Frenchmen on Co-
lumbia's sea-girt shore ; 
And let Grant but give the order, and Napo-
leon's hounds shall fly 
Like stricken deer the moment they the stars 
and stripes espy; 
For under those gallant generals we have con-
quered east and west, 
Against a 
braver foeman than of Europe's troops 
the best, 
And the time is not far distant when the world 
with gaze intent, 
Shall see our nation's banner float o'er this wide 
continent. 
Then as onward we are marching, brave sons 
of liberty, 
All rally ' neath our standard, ' tis the emblem 
of the free, 
Let our motto be " Excelsior," and we to that 
motto true, 
And they'll find the race is well nigth 
run of 
poor " Johnny Crapeau.", 
Then hurrah ! for sunny quarters, and hurrah ! 
for western steel, 
The prowess of our soldiers shall the French 
guerillas feel, 
TOM RUSSEL'S COMIC SONGS. 
65 
For we are marching on to glory! ' gainst a 
proud, invading foe, 
And we'll place old Uncle Sammy on the throne 
of Mexico. 
GOT IT ON TIIE BRAIN. 
Air—Goose hangs high. 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY TOM RUSSEL. 
How strange a 
thing a 
byword is, 
how easy to pick up; 
And when once you get to using them, 
You never can them drop: 
The latest one that has come out, 
From using it I 
can't refrain, 
No doubt you all have heard it, 
'Tis you've " Got it on the Brain." 
A 
person gets an idea, 
It sticks to him like wax, 
lie to further out that notion, 
All his energies will tax ; 
Grant ! he got one fastened to him, 
lie was not much to blame, 
For his, it was a 
good one, 
It was Richmond on the brain. 
Songs that are published now-a-days, 
IIave curious subjects for their rhymes, 
And if you'll pay attention, 
I 
will sing you a 
few lines: 
Mother, is the Battle Over ? 
Mother, I'll Come Home Again ! 
Song writers now throughout the land. 
Have got mother on the brain!

Our troubles now are settled, 
And peace restored once more, 
We'll allow no petty monarchy 
To blot our happy shore; 
Maximilian had better pack his trunk, 
And start for home again; 
For we've got the Monroe doctrine 
Rather heavy on the brain. 
WHAT'S THE DARKIES GOING TO DO? 
WRITTEN BY TOM RUSSEL. 
Air—Rip Rap. 
I'm only a 
poor nigger, 
That hasn't got much sense, 
But what I'm going to say 
I 
hope will give you no offence; 
I'm going to ask a 
question, 
And I 
hope you'll answer true— 
Now this cruel war is over, 
What's the darkies going to do ? 
Cliorus.—White folks, listen, 
And answer me quite true,— 
Now this cruel war is over, 
What's the darkies going to do ? 
Now this cruel war is over, 
Say what you going to do ? 
With the heaps of niggers floating round 
This country, through and through! 
They can't get a 
situation, 
As good as though they're white; 
I 
think the box the nigger's in 
Is getting kind of tight. 
Chorus.—White folks, listen, &e. 
TOM RUSSEL'S COMIC SONGS. 
67 
The " Injin" race is getting scarce, 
They're kind of run to seed; 
If the nigger he gets served that way, 
It will be hard indeed; 
He's caused a 
heap of trouble, 
But they doesn't show much sense, 
In punishing the niggers 
For other folks' offence. 
eltorus.—White folks, listen, &c. 
ALL TO ASTONISH TIIE BROWNS. 
AS SUNG BY TOM RUSSEL. 
THERE lived, and may be living still, 
In one of the streets of the town, 
A 
remarkable man who was called 
By the neighborhood, " Gentleman Brown ;" 
Very grand parties he gave, 
At which in champagne you might drown— 
Now he cut such a 
dash, all the street 
Were jealous of Gentleman Brown. 
Chorus.—Jokery, jeering, quiz— 
To the story I'm telling oh, list! 
How happy we mortals might be 
If jealousy did not exist. 
The Caggs, who resided next door, 
Were ever in sneers and in frowns, 
And bursting with spleen when they saw 
Such fine goings out at the Browns. 
One night Mrs. C. said to Caggs, 
Some husbands are such stingy clowns, 
Or they would give dinners and balls, 
And show off as well as the Browns. 
Chonts.—Jokery, jeering quiz, &e. 
In the course of your life find you may 
That a 
man has no power when his wife 
Is determined to have her own way. 
68 
TOM RUSSEL'S COMIC SONGS. 
Consider my income! said Caggs— 
Don't talk in that way, Mr. C., 
I 
warrant I'd make it suffice, 
If you would but leave it to me. 
Last Monday I 
saw well enough, 
When the tradesmen were going their rounds, 
Although they had money from us, 
I 
am sure they got none from the Browns. 
Chorus.—Jokery, jeering, quiz— 
It's one of the greatest of ills, 
When tradesmen send in their ac-
counts, 
And will have nothing else but their 
bills. 
Caggs submitted to his better half, 
Or rather two-thirds, I 
should say, 
And she soon sent her orders about, 
Determined to have a 
display. 
Her daughters were full of delight, 
On Sunday they sported new gowns, 
And exchtimed as they went to the church, 
how we shall astonish the Browns ! 
Chorus.—Jokery. jeering, quiz— 
What pleasures arise in the breast, 
When we, as we walk through the 
streets, 
Are conscious of being well dressed 
Preparations were made for a 
feast: 
Tinted cards, highly glazed and embossed, 
Invited the neighbors who came, 
And many in wonder were lost. 
Champagne, claret, ices, milk-punch, 
And cakes ornamented with crowns, 
Soups, jellies, and scented pastilles, 
And all to astonish the Browns I

69 
Chorus.—Jokery, jeering, quiz— 
Most people are fond of a 
feast, 
And they love those who give ' em the 
most, 
More than those folks who give 'em 
the least. 
One party soon drew on another, 
And then to continue the game, 
As the Browns were a-going to the races, 
The Caggs must of course do the same. 
Lauk I 
how surprised they will be, 
When they see us appear on the Downs— 
We will go in a 
carriage and four, 
And we shall so astonish the Browns! 
Chorus.—Jokery, jeering, quiz— 
The neighbors 
said, Caggs 
w,p.s 
clever; 
But as sure as eggs be but eggs, 
Such things won't continue for ever. 
Whatever was done by the B.'s, 
The C.'s tried to do more than equal; 
But as they had not the same means, 
They failed, as you'll see by the sequel. 
They were forced to run off from the street, 
For fortunes looked on ' em with frowns, 
And what was more galling than all, 
It did not astonish the Browns. 
Citorus.—Jokery, jeering, quiz— 
Many folks, in this world's ups and 
downs, 
Very often astonish themselves, 
When they try to astonish 
the 
Browns. 
My tale I'll conclude with a 
proverb, 
In which there's a 
good deal of sense— 
Your pounds may be left to themselves, 
If you will take care of the pence.

TOM RUSSEL'S COMIC SONGS. 
In this you'll discover my moral, 
A 
moral worth mitres and crowns ; 
If you would save silver and gold, 
You must always beware of the Browns. 
Chorus.—Jokery, jeering, quiz— 
Be cautious in every big town, 
Or in trying to do you'll get done, 
And not only done, but done brown 
LAKE SHORE ON A SUNDAY NIGIIT. 
WRITTEN FOR AND SUNG BY TOM RUSSEL. 
IT 
is a 
comic scene to see, 
I 
think with me you will agree, 
Just go for once, and take a 
sight 
Of the Lake Shore on a 
Sunday night; 
If the moon is brightly shining 
O'er the waters clear, 
Then the boys and girls combining, 
That way their course will steer. 
Chorus.-011 ! ' tis funny as I 
tell you, 
It has satisfied me quite; 
There is no such place in all Chicago, 
As the Lake Shore on a 
Sunday night. 
Farmers' daughters from the prairie, 
From the city every swell ; 
Dandy niggers, cattle-buyers— 
Lady waiters from each hotel; 
Waterfalls in every fashion, 
Dangling round you left and right, 
You feel " all over " they're so dashing_ 
In fact it is a 
curious sight. 
Chorus.—Oh 'tis funny as I 
tell you, &e. 
TOM RUSSEL'S COMIC SONGS.

Gals with bustles, and without, sirs, 
All in crinoline do show, 
Dressed to kill, they all come out, sirs, 
Looking round for a 
nice beau. 
But young men a 
warning take, sirs, 
Don't you on the grass go play, 
The Mayor he lately passed a 
law, sirs, 
If caught, you fifty dollars pay. 
Chorus.—Oh I ' tis funny as I 
tell you, &e. 
Once a 
charming maid I 
met, sirs, 
She was pretty, on my life, 
But like them all she would not talk, sirs, 
Unless the subject was a 
wife. 
Yes, the western girls together, 
To young men they do give pain, 
You cannot talk a " Snap" unto them— 
They've all got marriage on the brain. 
Chorus.—Oh I ' tis funny as I 
tell you, &C. 
I 
have caught them, big and little, 
Walking out upon the shore, 
But a " mutton pedlar" dished me, 
I 
can never catch them more. 
Wide awake, they'll draw you onward, 
And when you think the matter's right, 
Nail you quick upon the spot, sirs, 
For Lake Shore fun on a 
Sunday night. 
Chorus.—Oh I ' tis funny as I 
tell you, &c. 
THE RIGHT MEN IN THE RIGHT PLACE. 
WRITTEN FOR AND SUNG BY TOM RUSSEL. 
Air—Up, up with the flag. 
Ourt nation has been in a 
very bad way, 
But the darkness has fled ' fore the brightness 
of day;

TOM RUSSEL'S COMIC SONGS. 
No more can a 
trhitor our banner deface, 
For we've got the right men in the right place. 
Ben Butler a 
good provost-marshal did make, 
But to give him command, why, it was a 
mis-
take, 
So homeward they sent him law-papers to trace, 
lie was not the right man in the right place. 
When Grant, as a 
colonel, from Illinois went, 
With the brave Twenty First, on sure victory 
. 
bent, 
how soon we found out he'd be first in the race; 
That he was the right man in the right place. 
When Sheridan quick to the valley did go, 
his cavalry havoc soon made with the foe— 
The blood of old Ireland it beams in his face, 
And he was the right man in the right place. 
When Sherman his march through Georgia did 
take, 
Quick time to their homes all the rebels did 
make; 
He swore he'd kill those who our flag did deface, 
For he was the right man in the right place. . 
The last scene of all was decidedly rich, 
Jeff Davis in petticoats! in the last ditch; 
When the rope's round his neck, and wiped out 
our disgrace, • 
Why then the right man willbe in the right 
place.
