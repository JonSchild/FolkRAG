 Basques don't celebrate birth-

Company,  1963.
 
p
. 6  We read in the Bible that King Pharoah celebrated his bw birthday
 
by making a feast for his court followers.
 That was over 4,000 years ago.
 
The story of wicked King Herod tells that on his I
va birthday he "made a
 
supper to his lords, high captains", and other special friends in Galilee.
 
At this feast Herod provided dancing girls to entertain his guests.
 
Christmas
 
p
. 7  Early birthday observances were held only to honor pro-
i
ninent men in a country.
 Little attention was paid to the birthdays of
 
common people, and practically none was given to those of children.
 
p
.  9  The custom of gigingparties on birthdays goes back to
 
the days when people believed that good and evil spirits, sometimes known
 
as good and bad fairies, appeared at the time of a child's birth and in-
fluenced him all through life.
 These early people also believed that any
 
kind of change in a person's life was  a dangerous thing, because then evil
 
spirits were rhtought to be especially active.
 Birthdays were believed to
 
be filled with unknown dangers because they marked a time change from one
 
year to another.
 In order to keep the evil spirits from working their
 
harmful black magiv at these birthday changes, people tried to think of ways
 
o protect the one who was having a birthday. They then began the custom
 
'
f giving a birthday party to which they invited friends and members of the
 
a
rnily of the birthday person.
 They believed that by surrounding him with
 
o
od friends and showering him with good wishes,  they wouèd scare away the
 
ui sprits.... p
. ii  The Germans are given credit for starting celebrations
 
children's birthdays.
 R These celebrations are called kinderfeste.
 
r
le  word kinderfest comes from the two German words x  .
... children and party.
 
1
1. and 12  The custom of decorating the birthday cake with lighted
 
ndles seems to have been started by the Germans.
 
17  Even though some countries may have their own traditional birthday
 
ngs, the one birthday song that is becoming most popular all round the
 
r1d is the American favorite:
 Happy birthday to you etc.
 
This song was written many years ago by Mildred J. and Patty
 .
 
Hill.
 No one seems to know exactly when it was written, but it is probably
 
more than 60 years agoxx old.

 (
after Joseph interprets the
 
orvants' dreams while in prison)
 
20:
 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's
 
birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he
 
if ted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker
 
among his servants.
 
21.
 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership anain;
 
and he gave the cup into Pharoah's hand;
 
22 But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to t
iv n.
 
r
att ew Chapter 14.
 
I At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus.
 
2 And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is
 
risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do show forth
 
themselves in him.
 
3
.
 For Herod had laid hold on John and bound him, and put him i
 
prison for Herodias'  sake, his brother Philip's wife.
 
4  For John said unto him,  It is not lawful for thee to have her,
 
5  And when he would have put him to death, he feared the mu1t1rnd ,
 
because they counted him as a prophet.
 
6  But when Herod's birthday was kept,  the daughter of Herodias
 
danced before them, and pleased Herod.
 
7  Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she
 
would ask.
 
a  And she,  being before instructed of her mother,  said, Give i
ie
 
here goxkx John Baptist's head in a charger.
 
9
.
 And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and
 
them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be do given her.
 
10  And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.

But it was in the custom of New Year's gifts that the duke and Duchesc
 
(Louis of Orleans) displayed the truly vor royal magnificance, as we
 
find described in the accounts of their expenses.
 For instance, in 1388
 
they paid 400 francs of gold for sheets of silk to give to those who
 
received the New Year's gifts from the King and Queen.
 In 1402, 100
 
pounds (tournois) were given to Jehan Tatenne, goldsmith, for six silver
 
cups presented to Jacques do Paschin,  the Duke' s squire.

The Sundays and the fete days which the people of Paris devoted especially
 
to their amusements represented in reality a third of the whole year,
 
for the holy days which the Church authorized or tolerated the observance,
 
added to those which were obligatory were so frequent that the economists
 
and philosophers might plausibly argue that the ecclesiastical authorities
 
should be called upon to reduce the number.
 In his circular to all the
 
magistrates of the kingdom, Voltaire.... stated (
1756) "Twenty fete days
 
too many in the country condemn to inactivity and expose to dissipation
 
twenty times a year ten millions of working-men each of whom would earn
 
five pence a day, and this gives a total of 180,000,000 livres  (
7,200,000

 A 14-year-old Kirkcasdy gir .
 
says:  "Nip the person concerned, kick her with your knee,
 
pull her hair according to age.
 Sometimes several girls lift
 
her up and bang her on the floor."
 A group of  wansoa girl
 
confess that their salutation,  likewise,  is to p
rm  tug thr ,
 
of her whose special day it is, or pinch her once for eac
 
of her years, and then they turn her round and push her in
 
the back,  "once for luck".
 A teacher in London, & E

reports that both boys and girls there bump the person who
 
celebrating his birthday.
 "They take hold of arms and le,-,
,
 
lift him as high as they can and b mp him on the ground,  .

respectively.

 To ensure a long life the Chinese have recourse to certain coi-
licated charms, which concentrate in themselves the magical essenee emana
 
,on homeopathic principles, from times and seasons, from persons and fr
 
things.
 The vehicles employed to transmit these happy influences are r
1c
.
 
other than grave-clothes.
 These are provided by many Chinese in their
 
lifetime, and most people have them cut out and sewn by an unmarried gir
 
or a very young woman, wisely calculating that, since such a person is
 
likely to live a great many years to come, a part of her capacity to live
 
long must surely pass into the clothes, and thus stave off for many yearn
 
the time when they shall be put to their proper use.
 Further,  the gar-
n
ents are made by preference in a year which has an intercalary month;
 
for to the Chinese mind it seems plain t
Iat grave-clothes made tha a ye:r
 
which is unusually long will possess the
-capacity of prolonging life in
 
an unusually high degree.
 Amongst the clothes ehtere is one robe in pr
 
ticular on which special pains have been lavished to imbue it with thir
 
priceless quality.
 It is a long silken gown of the deepest blue colour,
 
with the word "longevity" e
mnbriodered all over it in thread of gold.
 i
 
present an aged parent with one of these costly and splendid mantles, 1
 
as
 "longevity garments" is esteemed by the Chinese an act of filial piet
 
and a delicate mark of attention.  As the garment purports to prolong the
 
life of its owner, he often wears it, especially on festive occasions,
 
order to allow the influence of longevity, created by the many golden
 
letters witb which it is bespangled, w to work their full effect upon
 
person.
 On his birthday, above all, he hardly ever fails to do it, for jr
 
China common sense bids a man lay in a large stock of vital energy on hi
 
h
jrrhr!av,  ro he expended in the form of health and gi our during the
 
i
 of 1

CerIL iy  the con - 
ratuiations of friends and relations, who warmly express their admirat
 
of these magnificent cerer
nents, and of the filial po piety which prompted
 
the children to bestow so beautiful and useful a present on the author
 
of their being.

 In Madagascar this mode of cheating the fates is reduced to
 
regular system.
 Here every man's fortune is determined by the day or hour
 
of his birth, and if that happens to be an unlucky one his fate is sealed,
 
unless the mischief can be extracted, as the phrase goes, by means of a
 
substitute.
 The ways of extracting the mischief are various.
 For exampiru
 
if a man is born of the first day of the second month (February), his hons
 
will be burnt down when he comes of age.
 To take time by the forelock and
 
avoid this catastrophe,  the friends of the infant will set up a shed ma
 
field or in the cattle-fold and burn it.
 If the ceremony is to be really
 
effective,  the child and his mother should be placed in the shed and on.y
 
i plucked, like brands, from the burning hut before it is too late.
 
Again, dripping November is the month of tears, and he who is born in i
t-
is 
 born to sorrow.
 But in order to disperse the clouds that thus gather
 
over his future, he has nothing to do but to take the lid off a boiling
 
pot and wave it about.
 The drops that fall from it will accomplish his
 
destiny and so prevent the tears from trickling from his eyes.... Footuot:e

s t

o
f A
l. de Rochas, one o
f our chief authorities, who
 
pointed out i
n 1

hat t
he Briton word c

meant '

hat t
his word would easily
 
a
ssume both t

g
eneral popular belief may s
till be t
he more
 
c

hat t
he Cagots a
re descended f
rom
 
s
ome Visigoths o

eft b
ehind
 
i
n t
he Pyrenees when t
hese barbaric hordes pushed
 
t
hrough i
nto Spain and Africa i
n t

Thus would be explained t
i
me above-mentioned
 
b
lue eyes and l
ight hair, t
he word Cagot i
tself
 
(
canes Gothi =
 '

f Goths '
), and t

 For i

t

 Hence Gnilheau, quoted
 
by Tuke, may m os

t

or o
f s
eeds kneaded with the b
lood o

carried i

therwise r
everenced.  The heart was
 
then cut out, as i

acrif

was d
istributed among the people and eaten r
itually.  The
 
most marked i

f the g
od Huitzilopochtli,
 
whose image was r
itually s
lain, while the cere monial eating
 
was called t
en
 queslo, 'god i

and c

s n
ot
,
 
a

o s
ee the patient.  As a youngster I
 
a

that he had been s

le Was assuir(cl
 
that t
he patient had never taken i

i
e p
ersisted.
 
After te patient's death, a cupboard was f

empty bottles o

hud
 
extremely valuable d

These exceptions r

The celebration of a child's birthday may be simple o
 
borate.  It may be held for the family only, with a special dinner that

1ad
.es all the child's favorite foods and is followed by a birthday cake with
 
lighted candles.  Or there may be a party, with other children invited as
 
aests.  They usually bring presents, too.  There are games and refreshments,
 
unny paper hats to wear and snappers to pull with a loud bang, so that then
 
pen up to show the prize inside.
 
The high point of the birthday celebration comes aftea
 
inner or toward the end of the party.  It is themoment when the lights are
 
atned off and the birthday cake, ablaze with candles, is carried in.  As it
 
comes, everybody sings, "Happy birthday to you!"
 
The cake is covered with decorations -
- sugar flowers a
i
 
L
eaves and scrolls and usually a greeting written in icing.
 It holds tiny
 
colored candles, the same number of candles as the child is years of age.  Th_
 
cake is Olaced in front of the birthday child.  He makes a wish and hiows cet
 
the candles.
 If he succeeds in blowing them all out in one breath, his wiEL
 
ill come true.
 
Then the cake is cut and pieces are given to everybody.

I

Square. where I
 l
ive. I
t
's a
 
short walk, but I
 l
ove using
 
my bus pass and saving
 
money. The driver was a
 
handsome woman  who
 
smiled a
t me, and said,
 
"Good morning."
 
At e
ach s
top, she g
reeted
 
t
he people who got on, and
 
then, after about three
 
s
tops, she announced, "
I
 
hope I
 s
aid g
ood morning t
o
 
e
verybody, but I
f I
 missed
 
anyone, I
'm s
orry. Let's hear
 
i
t
 now. A
ll t
ogether!"
 
A
ll on t
he bus shouted
 
back, "Good morning!" Ev-
e
rybody l
aughed. and my
 
s
eat-mate s
aid, "Wouldn't I
t
 
be wonderful i
f we could
 
s
tart every day t
his way."
 
As I
 was g
etting o
ff t
he bus, I
 
:
told the driver, "
it's my
 
b
irthday, and that's the
 
n
icest p
resent I
've gotten s
o
 
f
ar, Thank you."
 
"Good heavens," she
 
s
aid. "We've got a b
irthday
 
person on t
his bus. Let's
 
hear i
t now. A
ll t
ogether.
 
Happy b
irthday t
o you, hap- i
 
py b

whole bus j
oined i

I
 got o
ff and went across
 
the s
treet t

Society Some 25 years ago.  But the whole bi rthd ay

and the t. v.  interviewer asked each his name and age.  One
 
said,  "My name is -

 and I'm 20 years old today."  "Oh,  the
 
announcer said,  "well,  happy birthday".  The pri soner said,
 
"Thank you,,  and the interview went on.  No one seemed to find
 
the exchange at all ironic.
 
The universality of wishing someone a "happy birthday"
 
had actually become apparent to me first in quite another
 
context.  I was lecturing on folksong to an audience of
 
Southern Californians and had run down the usual 
so ng characteristics :

abstraction,  to my
 
audience.  What I called "folk songs"  (

they-
clearly connected with memories of elementary classrooms in
 
which these songs had been Offici ally taught them from
 
rinted school books by a teacher who scolded them if they
 
id not sing them the right way.

Methodologically,  this struck me as a neat and elegant
 
little problem;  in practice it led me into a kind of Golden
 
Bough exploration,  winding up some hundred pages later with
 
vast quantities of material still uncovered. Don't worry -
-
 I
 
will only give you a few of the critical points isn this
 
report.
 
I began by investigating the history of the song itself.
 
Having never been attracted to the theory of "gesunkenes
 
kulturgut" -
-
 the 19th century notion that folksongs are
 
simply lower class versions of upper class artistic products
 
-
-
 it is annoying to admit that "Happy Birthday to You" is an
 
excellent example of this concept.  The second blow to my
 
morale was the clear evidence that our song was not archaic,
 
not anonymous,  and not even particularly old,  all of which I
 
had somewhat patronizingly assumed.
 
It first appeared in 1898 in the form of a parent song,
 
"Good Morning to All"  (a song still known in kindergarten
 
circles)  in a volume titled "Song Stories for the
 
Kindergarten and Nursery School" prepared by two maiden
 
school teachers,  one of whom was so distinguished that her
 
death,  in 1936,  was noted by a full column obituary in the
 
New York Times.
 
Miss Mildred J.  Hill,  composer of the team,  is listed in
 
the ASCAP biographical Dictionary as a "church organist,
 
concert pianist and authority on Negro spirituals". Further
 
she worked with her younger sister,  Miss Patty,  as a music
 
teacher in the latter's experimental kindergarten training
 
school.
 
Patty Smith Hill,  lyricist,  was perhaps a mnore vigorous
 
woman,  clearly possessed of daring,  determination and
 
intellectual ability.  Her formal education ended with her
 
graduation from high school in 1887,  at which time she began
 
her life as a kindergarten teacher. A dedicated and
 
unregenate Deweyite,  her radical and successful innovations
 
in both curriculum and methodology were so impressive that
 
-
 , Columbia,
 
which also awarded her the honorary degree of Doctor of
 
Letters.
 
"Miss Patty" was a president of the Association for
 
Childhood Education and the first Chair of the National
 
Association for Nursery Education.  Her literary output
 
includes "Experimental Studies in Kindergarten Theory and
 
Practice" and,  with Vera Fedievsky,  "Nursery School and
 
Parent Education in Soviet Russia," published in 1936.  But
 
despite her undoubted professional achievements,  her most
 
influential literary productions will probably prove to be
 
the two brief songs for which she provided the lyrics,  "Good
 
Morning to All" and "Happy Birthday to You".
 
It has proven curiously difficult,  in fact,  impossible
 
to determine at  just what point after the 1893 publication of
 
Song Stories for the Kindergarten and Primary Schools,  Miss
 
Patty set the lyric lines now known as "Happy Birthday to
 
You" to the melody of "Good Morning to All".  Since it all
 
happened so relatively recently,  it is frustrating to find
 
that apparently nobody ever asked her,  or if they did,  she
 
didn't say.  Given her profession and overall educational
 
philosophy,  it seems likely that the parody lines simply
 
evolved in some kindergarten classroom under her general
 
aegis.  In any event,  the first publication record is not
 
until 1934 when "The Happy Birthday March" by Mildred H.  and
 
Patty S.  Hill was printed in sheet music form,  without
 
lyrics,  by the Summy Publishing Company,  then of Chicago,
 
which followed it in 1935,  by the publication of a sheet
 
music edition with lyrics.
 
There followed immediately a whole rash of litigations
 
instigated by the Summy Company over the problem of copyright
 
infringement,  the most prominent being against Irving Berlin
 
who had,  in all innocence,  apparently,  used "Happy Birthday
 
to You" in a skit in his Broadway review,  "As Thousands
 
Cheer".  The authors of "Panama Hattie" and "The Male Animal"
 
also paid up handsomely,  and it is to be assumed that the
 
Misses Hill's retirement years were comfortable indeed.
 
The point is that even as early as  1935 most people
 
simply assumed  (as I certainly would have)  that  "Happy
 
Birthday to You" was a folk song or at least,  old enough to
 
be in the public domain.  Even the telegraph companies thought
 
so.  The singing telegram service was inaugurated in 1936 and
 
"Happy Birthday to You:  became widely known throughout
 
Western Union as  "the cake taker",  and by 1941 it was
 
estimated that it had been sung at least a million and a half
 
times by the telegraph minstrels.
 
One of the striking features of the story just outlined
 
concerns the overall speed of events.In the area of folklore
 
one grows accustomed to thinking in terms of the majestic
 
procession on centuries.  "Happy Birthday to You" became
 
firmly established as a "folk song" within the popular mind
 
within a period of forty years at the absolute outside limit.
 
And if one considers that the "happy birthday" lyric was
 
written some time after 1893 and that the song wass fully
 
accepted as a folk song some time before 1933,  ten or even
 
twenty years could be shaved off at a consservative estimate.
 
I suspect that the historical biases of most folklorists
 
lead us to think of the tradition-establishing process as far
 
more lengthy and cumbersome than it actually is.  One of the
 
many things I learned when my children were small was that
 
only by the most agile footwork on my part was I able to
 
avoid establishing traditions onan almost hourly basis.
(***)
 
Human beings -
 the "pattern-makers and the pattern-
perceivers" start work at their basic job from the moment of
 
birth.
 
The critical element,  then,  is not the initiation of a
 
tradition but its dissemination and its acceptance.  The
 
question of dissemination,  or spread,  it seems to me,  has
 
already been taken care of.It is difficult even to
 
hypothesize two more speedy and effective agents of mass
 
circulation than what the Opies call the "schoolchild
 
underground" and the entire wireless telegraph industry.
(***)
 
But a song not only has to move;  it has also,  in a sense,  to
 
stay still.  It must be remembered.  It has to fit.
 
In tackling the problem of mass acceptance,  it seems
 
appropriate,  first,  to scrutinize closely the item being
 
disseminated.  I started with the music,  and should like to
 
report only briefly here that,  when Miss Mildred composed her
 
brief tune,  she hit in the center of a large cluster of
 
American musical norms.  For example out of twelve of the
 
pertinent charactereistics listed by Jan Philip Schinhan in
 
"The Music of the Songs and Balids in the Frank C. Brown
 
collection",  Miss Milldred's tune conforms to nine exactly
 
and well within range on three.  In other words,  she was
 
successful in writing a melody which most Americans can feel
 
comfortable singing,  since it falls well within the
 
dimensions of our overall opinions as to what a tune "ought"
 
to be.
 
The same thing cannot be said,  exactly,  of the lyrics,
 
which are not only rudimentary but which make the same
 
statement four times hand-running with only one slight
 
variation.  Some degree of repetition,  of course,
 
characterizes all oral literature,  but some genres and some
 
societies seem to feel it more important than others.Overall,
 
redundancy does not seem to be a stressed characterizer of
 
American song style -
-
 the very existence of the narrative
 
ballad as an important song form indicates otherwise.  The
 
extent of the redundancy in the lyric of "Happy Birthday to
 
You" may then indicate either that the Misses Hill were
 
playing about with the non-normal -
-
 as all creative people
 
must do to some extent -
-
 or else that the redundant
 
statement is simply so important that it can stand being
 
repeated four times.
 
If one stops laughing and really takes a hard look at
 
the verbal content of the statement  "Happy birthday to you",
 
one is struck by what a limited remark it is.  It contains no
 
whisper of past deeds nor future prospects;  no
 
congratulations;  no good wishes beyond the day.  Yesterday,
 
you could have done something hateful or magnificent,
 
cowardly or great-hearted;  tomorrow I may wish you either
 
well or 111.  Today -
-
 and today only -
-
 you get a happy
 
birthday.
 
This highly restricted statement is also directed
 
towards only one individual,  by virtue of the song's
 
isnclusion,  as the only departure from almost total
 
redundancy,  of the name of the particular birthday celebrant
 
Indeed,  on occasions when the song is sung by a group,  each
 
person singing tends to use the name by which he normally
 
addresses the individual in direct conversation.  The
 
resultant cacapohony:  "Happy birthday,  dear daddy,  Mister
 
Jones,  John,  Grandpa,  Uncle John" makes even more explicit
 
the essential function of the lyric line:  to convey a
 
rigorously limited statement from a single individual to
 
another single individual.
 
But,  paradoxically,  the song as a whole is admirably
 
adapted to group singing and indeed is most frequently sung
 
by groups.  The repetitive text,  the absence of difficult
 
articulations,  the single not overly difficult vocal leap,
 
ther restricted melodic range,  the four-squasre metric
 
construction stand in sharp contrast to the individualistic
 
content of the lyric's message.  I have considered then ther
 
possibility that one of the reasons for the song's remarkable
 
attractiveness of Americans is that it presents a paradigm of
 
one of the principal ways that we often think of groups -
-
 as
 
temporary assemblages of discrete units,  co-incidental
 
collections of separate and distinct individuals,  rather like
 
the group we're enjoying ourselves in today.
 
In passing it is instructive to see what happens to our
 
song when it is translated into other languages,  for "Happy
 
Birthday to You"  is on the way to becoming an international
 
favorite.  I have no evidence as to how widely it is sung or
 
how popular it is,  and I suspect that some of its
 
translations are the work of missionaries and the like;  still
 
Happy Birthday does exist in tongues as improbable as Tagalog
 
and Yoruba.
 
In more than one Spanish-speaking country,  one sings
 
"Feliz cumpleanos para ti" and it is significant that the
 
temr "cumpleanos", .
 isn contrast to "aniversario" or
 
"natividad",  is translatable as "completion of many years" -
-
a clear suggestion of past and future.  In Holland one sings
 
forthrightly,  "Long may he live,  long may he live,  long may
 
he live in prosperity,  hip hip hooray!".  In Ewe,  the song
 
goes  "May birthday's blessings be yours,  may many more years
 
be yours,  one year after another,  may God bless you."
 
Throughout the 25 or so translations I have casually
 
accumulated,  one invariably observes more linguistic content
 
than thr original.  They are more complex,  less redundant,  and
 
all contain references to past or future or both. None speak
 
of the birthday in the same isolated way that the A merican
 
version does,  as though the birthday were a frozen chunk of
 
time,  a spatially separate twenty-four hour unit.
 
The restricted nature of the American message,  on the
 
other hand -
-
 "I  (
independently)  wish you  (
individually)  a
 
rigorously limited time period  (
24 hours,  no more,  no less)
 
of happiness without reference to what you have accomplished
 
in the past nor what you may do in future" -
-
 explains how
 
Amnericans can with perfect aplomb and a complete absence of
 
irony,  wish a prisoner in chains a "happy birthday".  It is
 
also why we can sit in a restaurant and sing "Happy Birthday
 
to You" to some total stranger we can't even see across the
 
room.  There's nothing personal about it at all.  To Americans,
 
every dog has his day,  and every human being gets a birthday,
 
once a year. All you have to do is to be alive at the right
 
time.
 
Is that what we're celebrating? Is that -
-
 as has been
 
said in another connection -
-
 all there is? Well,  that's what
 
the song says -
-
 that stupid little folksong that everybody
 
knows -
-
 and I think it's right on the money. Many people
 
have spoken of the birthday under the general anthropological
 
c 1 r
' r y  of a  it
 nt  p as sage,
 ar
. d  pe rh a ps  i
t

 a  ir, some
 
ocie(
/ties or on some special occasions -
-
 but in general,  I
 
believe this categorization to be in error.  Certainly the
 
overall form of the celebration suggests a passing rite;
 
however,  several distnctive features of the American birthday
 
concept suggest otherwise.  The birthday celebrant is not
 
expected to he himself altered by the experience for one
 
thing nor is his social condition any different than before.
 
Besides,  the condition of having a birthday is neither
 
achieved by the individual nor conferred by the culture.It
 
simply occurs annually throughout the life span.
 
Thus the American birthday appears to function as a
 
ceremonial of individual social recognition.  Once a year,
 
Americans seem to feel a social compulsion to say to each
 
person separately:  you are alive;  I greet you;  I hope you're
 
happy about it all.
 
The limitations,  the "lack" of content of the birthday
 
message become,  therefore,  very i
iimportant.
the simple condition of being alive rather  th

 is
 
what is being celebrated,  then you can't qualify it.  Great
 
deeds and noble accomplishments have nothing to do with it.
 
It is the very impersonality of the American birthday wish
 
that makes its fundamental h umanism possible.
 
You neither have to know nor like the individual to be
 
able to honor the fact that he exists,  if that's all you're
 
doing;  nor do you have to feel y ou must wish him well in
 
future.  The day after his birthday,  he can fall and break a
 
leg,  or you can do him down in a business deal,  or completely
 
ignore his existence.  But on his birthday,  he is there,
 
simply there,  and attention must be paid.
 
I have to admit that I started out this project not
 
liking birthdays very much.  They seemed to me trivial,  f
1
 
gO greed and commercialism,  featuring
 a kind of "Queen for a
 
Day" shallownes
nd glitch.  But as I' ve grown older,  I've
 
sa  
 
A
 
gained much more respect for the
 delicacy of the  I
 
cultural fabric that holds us all together.  It is a fabric
 
made up of subtly interwoven and complex cultural
 
compromises,  and it has begun to seem to me that where the
 
birthday fits in is as a mediating influence between two very
 
contradictory aspects of American society:  our fundamental
 
and very deep-seated egalitarianism  (
still,  I believe,  a
 
strong force in American thought)  and our insistence on
 
unrestrained competitive individualism.
 
The two don't fit together very comfortably,  as the
 
history of the United States over the past two hundred years
 
has shown.  But the birthday ceremonial and its associated
 
song says:  every year,  every citizen,  good,  bad or
 
indifferent,  must be honored by his society for the fact of
 
his simple existence as a social unit.  There is,  it seems to
 
me,  a kind of reluctant nobility of concept here.  I hope it
 
survives.
 
And so,  this seems to me to be why all Americans know
 
and sing "Happy Birthday to You".  It is brief and undemanding
 
-
-
 as a "ceremonial" song,  it's a joke -
-
 but it is one of
 
our few songs constructed for a group to sing to an
 
individual,  which is what we want to do on a birthday.  It is
 
not sentimental nor poetically conceived,  and we would be
 
publicly embarrassed if it were,  and a lot of people,\wouldntt
 
sing it.  It is as tight-lipped and as flatly democratic as
 
the millions of Americans who do sing it each year. And above
 
all,  it says,  exactly and precisely-- no more,  no less -
-
just what we want to say. For if it said any more,  it could
 
not say as much -
-
 happy birthday to you.
