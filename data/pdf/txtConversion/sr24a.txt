I Owed Ten Dollars to O'Grady
AFS 1613 A1
Once I had a neighbor seemed sweet as honey, And whatever he possessed he said was
mine. I had sickness for a time and short of money, So I called on him, which seemed so
super fine.
Oh, I owed ten dollars to O'Grady, And you'd think he had a mortgage on my life. Every
morning he would call around to see me, And at night he would send around his wife.
When I'd get back to work he would ask for payday, I told him “Man said they'd held
two weeks back.” And he said “There must be something very rotten, When they hold a
fellow's money back like that.”
But still he called see me every morning, My every action he did seem to know. And his
other friends all seemed to smile about it, And I said “There's nothing but O'Grady's slow.”
Oh, I owed ten dollars to O'Grady, And you'd think he had a mortgage on my life. Every
morning he would call around to see me, And at night he would send around his wife.
Well at last my payday come, 'twas full and blooming, For I worked all overtime that I
could. As I never cared to see O'Grady's funeral, So I paid him back in full with interest
good.
Oh, I owed ten dollars to O'Grady, And you'd think he had a mortgage on my life. Every
morning he would call around to see me, And at night he would send around his wife.

Love it is a very funny thing, it catches the young and the old, It makes you feel like a fresh
water eel, and causes your head to swell. Your heart it will flutter and many things you'll
utter, for you think that everything is going well, But you're deaf, dumb, and blind, ??? until
you are delivered from her spell.
“So boys keep away from the girls,” I say, “And give them lot's of room. For mind when you
wed they will bang you till your dead, With a ball headed end of the broom.”
When the man falls in love with a little turtle dove, everything is new, He will kiss her for
her mother, sister, brother, till her father comes in view. A gun from his pocket, a trembling
hand to cock it to blow away his giddy little brains, It's loaded so it doesn't and his darling
says, “He mustn't.” They are kissing one another once again.
When she gets in your powers and you are busy all the while, You will linger all around her
hungry jaw with such a silly smile. She winks, laughs, and giggles like a kangaroo wiggles,
for she always likes to have you come her way, She will sing she will dance, yes, and take
a trip to France. Then you'll come along some rainy day.
“So boys keep away from the girls,” I say, “And give them lot's of room. For mind when you
wed they will bang you till your dead, With a ball headed end of the broom.”
Oh, when you are sixteen half starved kids, and must wear second handed cloths, And
where to turn for the next meal, and wearing your [plasters?] on your nose. The butcher
comes along with a gun [dog and song?] to collect his bills, you don't know where to turn,
You have little honey but you haven't any money and your face red as fire sure does burn.

Say just watch them when they go down street for you will say that I am right, For they see
everyone that passes whether morning, noon, or night. They are out for a walk and oh, my,
my how they talk, Yes, their tongues run like a [fanning mill?] you know. How they flirt, how
they tease and they're very ill at ease, Watch your step my boy and near them never go.

wed they'll bang you till your dead, With a ball headed end of the broom.”
