Now I

Central Park, just near dark, 
And I 
ventured to make a

That it was a

BOOTLE-TEM TOOTLE-TUM 
Sarah Jane was a 
frisky young maid, 
And good wages was paid, 
And at the fine house where she stayed 
I 
call'd on her most ey'ry day. 
But one evening she. 
drove me quite mad, 
Yes, quite mad, 'twas too bad; 
A 
Dutch barber beside her she had, 
Rootle-tum, tootle-turn tay. 
Tho' I 
Towed, etc. 
Mister Dutchman," says I, " this looks queer, 
Swilling here lager beer; 
But you ain't got no biz'ness down here, 
So listen to what I 
now say. 
If I 
catch you again here, forsooth, 
It's the truth, (though uncouth), 
I 
will darken your eyes, my sweet youth, 
Rootle-tum, tootle-turn tay." 
Tho' I 
vowed, etc. 
" 
Now," said he, " yy to you interfere, 
Mit us here, o'er our peer ; 
I've as much right as you to pe here, 
Und I'll leave it to Sarar to say." 
" 
Now, then, miss, your affections I'll test— 
Do not jest, I 
protest," 
And the barber she vow'd she lov'd best, 
Rootle-tum, tootle-turn tay. 
Tho' I 
vowed, etc. 
That she lov'd me I 
firmly believed, 
But how soon was deceived; 
Tho' it's no use me now being grieved, 
For he married and took her away. 
I 
wish him much joy of this belle, 
What a 
sell, I 
must tell ; 
I 
hear that she lathers him well, 
Lathers and bastes him each day!

Atn—" The Dutch Barber." 
As sung by HARRY RICHMOND. 
PRAY look on this warrior bold, 
And behold I've been sold, 
And I 
think when my story is told, 
Badly treated I've been you'll say, 
By- a 
girl who is named Susan Jane. 
Susan Jane was her name, 
But I 
ne'er wish to see her again, 
Dooble-dum, dooble-dum day. 
CHORUS. 
vow'd I 
never would leave her, 
She's proved a 
cruel deceiver, 
Doodle-dum, doodle-dum, doodle-drim, 
Doodle-dum, doodle-dum day. 
I 
met her first in Central Park, 
Yes, the Park, for a 
lark, 
And I 
ventured to make a 
remark, 
That it was a 
very cold day. 
Her answer was not at all bold, 
That it was far from cold— 
Her name and address she then told, 
Dooble-dtun, doodle-dum clay. 
I 
vow'd, etc. 
Susan Jane was a 
scullery maid, 
And ' twas said was well paid 
At a 
mansion up town where she stayed, 
And I 
saw her there every day. 
But one night I 
was drove nearly mad I 
0 
'
twas sad, far too bad, 
For a 
copper beside her she had, 
Doodle-dum, doodle-dunt day. 
I 
vow'd, etc. 
Said I, Policeman, this looks very queer, 
Very queer, drinking beer, 
You can't do your duty down here, 
So listen to what I 
do say: 
If I 
catch you in this house again, 
Once again, I'll complain 
To your governor, John Kennedy, 
Doodle-dum, doodle-dum day. 
I 
vow'd, etc. 
Said he, "Why do you interfere 
With me or my beer 
I've as much right as you to be here, 
And I'll leave it to Susan to say. 
Then she, false like the rest of her sex, 
That sex, made to vex, 
Said, I

Doodle-dum, doodle-dum day. 
I 
vow'd, etc. 
She loved me, I 
firmly believed, 
But how soon was deceived 
But there's no use of my being grieved, 
For I 
found they were wed yesterday. 
But I 
hope all the children they gets, 
The dear pets, of the male sex, 
Will be marked with a 
926, 
Doodle-dam, doodle-dum day.

THE EAST SIDE OP THE TOWN . 
THE FAMOUS EAST SIDE OF THE TOWN. 
As 
sung by TONY PASTOR at his Opera H ouse, 201 Bowery. 
ALL you who reside in the city, 
Now just give an ear to my ditty, 
And in verses quite witty 
I'll endeavor to do it up brown. 
Broadway may be famous for fashion, 
There Fifth Avenue belles dress so dashing, 
But as for myself, I've a 
passion 
For the famous East side of the town. 
Yes, the East side, etc. 
• 
If out in the morning you're slipping, 
See the working girls daintily tripping, 
As down to their shops they are tripping, 
With their eyes cast so modestly down. 
In their neat muslin dresses, none neater, 
Little gipsey hats set off each feature, 
Little waterfalls too, the dear creatures, 
On the famous East side of the town. 
Yes, the East side, etc. 
And now this advice I'll deliver' 
Just take a 
walk by th e East River, 
Of attention if there you're a 
giver, 
You'll see something worth noting down. 
There the ship-yards are always in motion, 
Building vessels to bridge o'er the ocean, 
Yankee models are found, I've a 
notion, 
On the famous East side of the town. 
Yes, the East side, etc. 
There are factories in operation, 
Our noble mechanics' creation, 
The sinew and strength of the nation, 
Who add to her fame and renown; 
WHAT I DON 'T SUPPOSE . 
To assist a 
poor friend they are willing, 
And with you they'll share their last shilling, 
But insult them, you're sure of a " milling," 
On the plucky East side of the town. 
Yes, the East side, etc. 
As relief to their daily exertions, 
They go in for all sorts of diversions, 
And they're great upon target excursions, 
Preferring a 
smile to a 
frown. 
At a 
raffle they're all in their glory, 
Like a 
good comic song or a 
story, 
And a 
shindig or hop's " hunky dory " 
On the jolly East side of the town. 
Yes, the East side, etc, 
Then on Saturday night see them steering, 
To the various saloons, lager biering, 
Where, no Excise Commissioners fearing, 
They pour it so rapidly down. 
They never look gloomy or lowry, 
But they've plenty of merriment hourly, 
On a 
Saturday night in the Bowery, 
On the famous East side of the town. 
Yes, the East side, etc.

WHAT I 
DON'T SUPPOSE. 
As 
sung by TONY PASTOR., at his Opera H ouse, N o. 201 flowery. 
A IR—" M erry M onth of M ay." 
OF 
course I'm here to sing to you, 
Myself the subject only knows, 
Suppose I 
sing you something new, 
And tell you the things I 
don't suppose; 
16 
wirAT I DON 'T SUPPOSE. 
For instance now I 
don't suppose 
That Gideon Welles on hay is fed, 
Or Andy Johnson could be hired 
To dance a 
hornpipe on his head, 
CHORUS. 
I 
don't suppose my song will fail • 
To cause a 
laugh where'er it goes; 
I 
don't suppose ' twill make you. rail 
To tell the things I 
don't suppose. 
I 
don't suppose that Brigham Young 
Will ever chance to die an old maid; 
I 
don't suppose that ducks and geese, 
Of a 
shower of rain are ever afraid; 
I 
don't suppose that General Grant 
Would travel about in an iron cage, 
And Queen Victoria, I 
don't suppose, 
Sings comic songs upon the stage. 
I.don't suppose, etc. 
I 
don't suppose that Greeley's black, 
Or Louis Napoleon has horns and tail, 
And the Freedman's Bureau, I 
don't suppose, 
In a 
furniture store is found for sale ; 
I 
don't suppose that railway trains 
From accident are ever secure, 
And Wendell Phillips, I 
don't suppose : 
For a 
dollar a 
night would dance the cure. 
I 
don't suppose, etc. 
I 
don't suppose that lager bier 
Is made of old hats and boots and shoes, 
And a 
politician, I 
don't suppose, 
A good fat -office would ever refuse; 
I 
don't suppose Lucy Stone goes round, 
With a 
German flute playing funny tunes, 
NOT FOR jOSEPIT. 
17 
And General Butler, I 
don't suppose, 
Would object to a 
dozen silver spoons, 
I 
don't suppose, etc. 
I 
don't suppose Thad Stevens could 
As a 
clown in a 
circus be hired to sing, 
And a 
pretty young lady, I 
don't suppose, 
Would ever object to a 
wedding ring; 
I 
don't suppose a 
nigger is white, 
Or a 
Dutchman goes by the name of Pat, 
And I 
don't suppose Fernando Wood 
Wears skeleton skirts and a 
gipsey hat. 
I 
don't suppose, etc. 
I 
don't suppose that Barnum's whale 
Wears any kid gloves upon its hand, 
And Maximilian, I 
don't suppose, 
Would like to be clerk to a 
peanut stand; 
There's Edwin Forrest, I 
don't suppose, 
As Hamlet on his head has stood, 
If I 
asked you to lend me a 
thousand dollars, 
I 
don't suppose there's one of you would. 
I 
don't suppose, etc. 
NOT FOR JOSEPH. 
As sung by HAroar RICHMOND. 
I'VE seen a 
bit of gayety throughout my short career, 
I 
once was foolish with my tin, but I 
have paid most dear. 
If folks would seek to take me in, they find it is no go, 
I'm up to almost every thing—you can't get over Joe. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, dear, no! not for Joe, if he knows it—not for Joseph. 
Oh, no, no! not for Joe—not for Joseph; oh, dear! no.

ANGELINA MINNIE MAY. 
The other day I 
met a 
friend, we passed the time of day, 
And chatted gayly down the street, but e'er I 
went away, 
I 
kindly asked this learned swell to take a 
parting drain. 
Oh, yes! said he, I 
think I 
will, then let it be champagne. 
SPOKEN.—" No, you don't, my dear fellow, you don't 
get champagne out of Joseph "— 
Oh! no! no; no, etc. 
Some time ago a 
friend of mine, he asked me out to dine, 
And there he introduced me to one he called divine '•  
He said she'd make a 
charming wife, and had such lots 
of tin, 
A widow only forty-two, my boy, go in and win. 
SPOKEN.—" Matrimony and lots of money, and a 
widow only forty-two; well, the money is very good, but 
then the widow "— 
Oh, dear! no, etc. 
And now, perhaps, I've sung my song, you might be in 
the cue. 
To show your kind acknowledgment, but that with me 
won't do, 
As for to-night I've done my best, and that you ought to 
know, 
So if you want a 
song again, don't try it on with Joe. 
Oh, dear! not for Joe, etc. 
ANGELINA MINNIE MAY. 
Song and Dance, as sung by DAVE REED. 
On, I 
never shall forget the happy day 
That I 
met my Angelina Minnie May; 
Her complexion it was sooty, 
You can bet she was a 
beauty,

For she stole-my heart and gizzard all away. 
This colored maid the darkeys did admire, 
When she smiled on me I 
thought I 
would expire; - 
But I 
could no longer tarry, 
For she said she wouldn't marry, 
But she stole my heart and gizzard all away. 
CHORUS. 
This color'd maid the darkeys did admire, 
When she smiled on me I 
thought I 
would expire; 
But I 
could no longer tarry, 
For she said she wouldn't marry, 
But she stole my heart and gizzard all away. 
In the sparkling of the silver shiny moon, 
This throbbing heart I 
offer'd as a 
boon ; 
She began to sigh and mutter, 
And she called me bread and butter ; 
I 
was sailing in Professor Low's balloon, 
You ought to see her promenade the street 
With her little gaiters on her fairy feet. 
Oh, the way she wears a 
gipsey, 
It would make a 
darkey tipsey, 
I 
declare I 
think she's good enough to eat. 
This color'd maid, etc. 
Now, this color'd maid you never see no more, 
She is sleeping on the Coney Island shore; 
Her spirit now is gliding, 
And with the little fishes hiding, 
I'm afraid I'll have to faint upon the floor. 
Now ladies, I 
must bid you all adieu, 
But I 
hope you don't believe my story true; 
So if you'll excuse my capers, 
I 
will print it in the papers, 
And I'll have it set to music just for you. 
This color'd maid, etc.

THE YELLOW ROSE OF TEXAS. 
THE YELLOW ROSE OF TEXAS. 
THERE'S a 
yellow rose in Texas that I'm agwine to see, 
No other darkey knows her, no darkey only me; 
She cried so when I 
left her, it like to broke my heart, 
And if I 
ever find her, we never more will part. 
CHORUS. 
She's the sweetest rose of color 
This darkey ever knew, 
Her eyes are bright as diamonds, 
They sparkle like the dew; 
You may talk about your dearest May, 
And sing of Rosa Lee, 
But the yellow Rose of Texas 
Beats the belles of Tennessee. 
When the Rio Grande is flowing, and the starry skies are 
bright, 
She walks along the river in the quiet summer night, 
She thinks, if I 
remember, when we parted long ago, 
I 
promised to come back again, and not to leave her so. 
She's the sweetest, etc. 
And now I'm gwine to find* her, for my heart is full of 
woe, 
And we'll sing the song together, that we sung so long 
ago, 
And we'll play the banjo gayly, and we'll sing the songs of 
yore, 
And the yellow Rose of Texas shall be mine for ever 
more. 
She's the sweetest, etc.

So off they scampered all that night, 
Like fairies bright in Connemara, 
But soon the party all got tight, 
And kicked up such a

Not one of the party has got sober.

JESSIE AT THE RAILWAY BAR 
One good turn deserves another, 
We'll be free and easy still, 
And have you seen my sister 
With the sword of Bunker Hill, 
At the Yankee quilting party, 
With old Joe of Tennessee ? 
We were boys and girls together 
In the cottage by the sea; 
The ship's on fire, so man the life-boat 
In the cottage by the sea. 
In the days when I 
was hard up, 
On the raging canawl, 
At the wake of Teddy the tiler 
Let me like a 
soldier fall. 
Mother, is the battle over, 
Do you ever think of me, 
And the girl I 
left behind me 
In the cottage by the sea 
She was sister to the angels, 
in the cottage by the sea. 
YEssrE AT Tku RAILWAY BAR. 
As 
sung by HARRY RICHMOND. 
'TWAS at the Harlem Station, in pursuit of my vocation, 
I 
saw a 
tall and handsome girl behind the railway bar. 
I 
heard some one call her Jessie, perhaps 'twas Mr. Smith, 
the lessee, 
And her diamond eyes were twinkling just like the 
evening star. 
I 
found this pretty dame made love to all who came, 
In a 
quiet sort of way with her eyes so soft and bright; 
She had lovers half a 
score, always some one to adore, 
From the first train in the morning till the last train out 
at night. 
JESSIE AT THE RAILWAY BAR . 
25 
SPOKEN.—Yes, her admirers were— 
A 
tinker and a 
tailor, and a 
soldier and a 
sailor, 
And a 
swell who used to talk about his pa and ma, 
A butcher and a 
baker, and a 
quiet-looking Quaker, 
All sparking little Jessie at the railway bar. 
This darling creature, with a 
smile on every feature, 
Was serving all her customers with wine and lager 
beer, 
And this was on a 
Monday, so I 
asked her if on Sunday 
She'd meet me in the park, when she gave me such a 
leer, 
And then she said to me, " Most happy I 
should be, 
But Fm sorry to inform you ' tis not my Sunday out ; 
One Sunday out of nine is the only one that's mine.' 
And then she had to leave me, to serve a 
glass of stout, 
SPOKEN.—Yes, but she didn't inform me that on pre-
vious Sundays she had walked out with 
A 
tinker and a 
tailor, etc. 
We're better late than never, and I 
thought that I 
was 
clever 
To get Jessie -dear to meet me when it was her Sunday 
out; 
With my hair curled and anointed, at the time and place 
appointed 
I 
was there to the moment, and began to look about, 
And when my Jessie catne, my heart was in a 
flame 
To see her waterfall and her bonnet trimmed so gay. 
She politely took my arm—I 
admired her every charm; 
But judge of my surprise when I 
heard some- urchins 
say— 
SPOKEN.—" Why, I 
say, Bill, if there ain't Jessie along 
with another chap! 
Why, I 
have seen her with—" 
A 
tinker and a 
tailor, etc. 
THE DUTCHMAN'S SLATE . 
Now, my confindence was shaken, but I 
thought the boys 
mistaken, 
And my modesty would not permit to ask if it was true ; 
I 
proposed, and she accepted, in a 
manner unaffected, 
The tears she shed completely hid from me her eyes of 
blue. 
1 
sent her a 
wedding dress, fit for an empress, • 
And I 
saw the porter give it her, 0, wasn't it jolly fun 7 
But on our wedding day Miss Jessie ran away, 
And married a 
chap who sold the herald and the sun. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, and the only consolation I 
had was that 
she had taken in, beside myself— 
A 
tinker and a 
tailor, etc. 
THE DUTCHMAN'S SLATE. 
As 
sung by H ARRY RICIIMOND. 
Am—" Enoch Arden." 
KIND friends, you was listen, I 
told you one story 
What happened to me here one day; 
I 
keep of this city a 
lager-bier saloon, 
And I 
tink of that business will pay. 
But my lager run out, and my Switzer-kase too, 
And I 
found out when it has been too late, 
Of you want to make money in this kind of business, 
By dam, you must not keep a 
slate. 
My friend Gasper Huntz, he called on me one day, 
And asked me for em n 
glass of bier; 
Ile drink that and said it was bully, a'nudder, 
And then rubs his belly right here. 
IIe called for more lager, and Switzer-kase too, 
And then he said that was first-rate; 
When I 
ask him for pay, he do so mit his eye, 
And told me put that on the slate. 
LIVELY AS A JAY LIED . 
Now I 
don't like that business, and so I 
was told him 
One day when he come mit my store: 
And there I 
saw Gasper a-drinking mine lager, 
And huggin' my wife mit the door. 
I 
take him shust so, mit the slack of his breeches, 
And pitch him right out on his head; 
I 
take down that slate and I 
break up that business, 
And den, shust you bet, I 
was mad.

SUNDAY. 
Sung by To 
PASTOR at his Opera House, No. 201 Bowery. 
Ant--" Rally Round the Flag." 
On, I 
never shall forget, no, as long as I'm alive, 
The damsel that won my affection. 
She was slim about the waist, and her age was twenty-
five. 
She'd light hair and a 
carrotty complexion. 
She wore high-heeled gaiters and a 
showy balmoral, 
And a 
little gipsey hat. 
She was such a 
pretty gal, 
And she gave me such a 
look that she stole away my 
heart, 
When I 
met her at Hoboken on a 
Sunday. 
Then I 
offered her my arm, and she took it with a 
smile, 
As I 
hoped my assurance she would pardon; 
And we walked along together, and we chatted for awhile, 
Then we strolled into a 
lager beer garden., 
Oh, hadn't she an appetite for drinking lager beer! 
She swallowed thirty glasses full at least, or very near, 
For the gal was very thirsty, and the day was very warm, 
When I 
met her at Hoboken on a 
Sunday. 
When I 
asked to see her home, she my offer did accept, 
And together for the ferry-boat we started. 
Then I bought a 
dollar bouquet, which she promised 
should be kept 
To remember me long after we had parted. 
We were seated in the cabin, and a 
sudden glance she 
threw 
At the diamond ring I 
wore, ' twas a 
pure first-water, 
too. 
Then she took it off my finger, and she put it on her 
own, 
And we coming from Hoboken on a 
Sunday. 
30 
I MET HER IT "HOBOKEN • 
ON A SUNDAY. 
Soon we landed in New York, and she said in tones so 
sweet, 
4-
4 
This pretty little ring I'm going to borrow, 
I'll be sure to give it back to you the first time that we 
meet 
For, of course, you'll come and see me on to-morrow. 
Then I 
had to let her keep it, for I 
thought 'twould be 
absurd 
To tell the pretty creature I 
was doubtful of her word ; 
But I 
felt like half an idiot, and the other half a 
fool, 
Fr I 
met her at Hoboken on a 
Sunday. 
We very soon were met by a 
fellow, big and stout, 
Who suddenly began for to abuse me. 
He hit me on the nose, and " Police!" I,hollered out; 
But the scoundrel did continue to ill use me. 
A 
policeman came, he charged me with assault and bat-
teree, 
He swore that I 
assaulted him, though. he assaulted 
me 
Then they took me to a 
station-house, and locked me in a 
cell, 
Through going to Hoboken on a 
Sunday. 
Next morning I 
was brought to court, I 
saw my damsel 
there, 
And then I 
thought iny prospects growing brighter; 
But that I 
Struck her husband first she solemnly did swear, 
And then the judge condetimed me as a 
fighter. 
They fined me twenty dollars, and then they let me go, 
But where my diarhond ring went to I'm sure I 
doesn't 
know, 
But I 
purchased my experience, and never, never more 
Will I 
travel to Hoboken on a 
Sunday.

Aix—" Spider and the Fly." 
THE other day I 
landed in the City of New York, 
I'd just got off the steamboat, and I 
started for a 
walk, 
When an ugly saffron-colored dog came barking at my 
feet. 
It wouldn't stop, I 
got enraged and kicked it in the 
street. • 
SPOKEN.—I 
had scarcely done so, when a 
tall man, 
dressed in black, with a 
white cravat, a 
red nose and long 
hair, tapped me on the shoulder, and, " Sir," says he, 
" 
I've a 
good mind to have you arrested. 
Do you know, 
sir, that we have a 
society for the prevention of cruelty 
to animals l 
But," said I, " that cur might have bitten 
me." 
Said he, " that's nothing; you shouldn't ill-treat 
the dog, for— 
" 
I'm one of the Commissioners, and this I 
tell you now, 
It's cruelty to animals, and that we emit allow." 
Next day I 
thought I'd take a 
drive, the Central Park to 
see. 
I 
hired a 
horse and wagon, and I 
started off with glee; 
But coming back the horse it baulked, the whip I 
gently 
used, 
When up another fellow came, and thus I 
was abused: 
'
SPOKEN.—" Ain't you ashamed of yourself'? 
How 
dare you attempt to horsewhip a 
horse'? 
If there was 
only a policeman in sight, I'd have you arrested im-
mediately." 
But luckily) as usual, there was no police-
man in sight. " Why," says I, " who are your " Me 1"

Next day, being fond of fishing, why, I 
bought a 
hook 
and line. 
And strolled down to the river just to pass away my time. 
I 
fixed my hook, put on the bait, the line was good and 
strong, 
And in half an hour I 
caught a 
fish about two inches 
long. 
SPOKEN.—I 
had just hauled it up, and was about trans-
ferring it to my basket—I 
had a 
very large basket— when 
a man came up to me, seized me by the collar, and 
exclaimed, in thunder tones, " Are you aware, sir, what 
you are doing, lacerating the mouth of that unf

sir, I 
shall instantly have you incarcerated in prison, for

I now resolved that I 
no more would through the city 
roan), 
So I 
bought some things I 
needed, and I 
started to go 
home. 
Among the rest a mouse-trap, which I 
carried in my 
hand, 
When a gentleman comes up to me and says in accents 
bland— 
SPOKEN.—" Might I 
inquire what is that you've got 
there?" " Certainly," says I; " it's a mouse- trap." 
"What!" says he, " would you choke the animals to 
death ? 
No! you shall do nothing of the kind. 
It's 
cruelty, sir, cruelty, and I 
shall confiscate this diabolical 
engine of torture." " But," said I, " it's my property !" 
" 
No matter for that," says he— 
" 
I'm one of the Commissioners, and this I 
tell you now, 
it's cruelty to animals, and that we don't allow,''

Just as I 
got down to the pier the steamboat went away, 
So I 
started back to my hotel another night to stay. 
I 
couldn't get a 
wink of sleep, but lay awake all night, 
For the cruel bed-bugs all around were biting left and 
right. 
SPOKEN.—When I 
arose in the morning there was one 
fellow as big as a 
turtle, sitting on the bolster grinning at 
me. I 
made a 
dart for . him, but he ran away up the wall 
and hid in a 
crevice. 
As I 
couldn't coax him out, I 
just 
transfixed him there with a 
pin. 
A boarder in the house 
passing by the door saw me at it, and presently entered 
the room, accompanied by two policemen. 
Ile gave me 
in charge, and I was arrested for cruelty to animals. 
They took me before the magistrate. 
I 
was locked up 
for two days and fined thirty dollars. 
As I 
paid it, the 
judge says to me, " Young man, let this be a 
warning to 
you in future, and remember that— 
" 
I'm one of the Commissioners, and this I 
tell you now, 
It's cruelty to animals, and that we don't allow."

Have gone to the sausage-machine with a 
growl. 
Nothing but petroleum can cheer me to-day, 
For a 
kerosene sour I 
would fervently pray; 
With none to console me, no kind friends near, 
Mother would wollop me if she were here. 
CHORUS. 
Gently her foot o'er my forehead she'd press, 
Trying to sober me when tight and in distress, 
Gently she'd say; " As I've got you so near, 
Mother will wollop you now you are here." 
THE TRIALS IN CANADA.

Cheerfully, faithfully mother would stay 
Always around me, by night and by day; 
If I 
would grumble or wish to complain, 
A 
slight touch of the poker would calm me again. 
Sweetly a 
mother's love shines from afar, 
Darkens and brightens like a 
policeman's star; 
In moonshine or sunshine, in snow or in rain, 
Mother's fantastics were always the same.

Am— " No Irish need apply." 
Sung by TONY PASTOR at his Opera House, No. 201 Bowery. 
ABOUT that news from Canada I'm feeling mighty quare, 
The blaggards are convicting all the Fenians over there. 
In cruel haste they tried them, and the cruel sentence 
passed ; 
But though their raid was but the first it will not be the 
last. 
For one that falls a 
thousand more will unto arms fly, 
For our cause, it, is the cause of right, a 
cause will never 
die. 
Old England boasts of mercy, aye, such as she oft 
employs, 
As blowing from the cannon's mouth the mutinous Sepoys. 
If other nations punish wrong, of cruelty she'll prate, 
But now they're trying on the game they tried in Ninety-
eight. 
But if she hangs her prisoners, another dose 
try, 
For our cause it is the cause of right, a 
cause will never 
die.

And if you do, their martyr names will be our battle- cry,

They boldly sought on British soil to strike a

Ant--" The Happy Land of Erin." 
LIST to me and I 
will tell 
Of the woes that me befell, 
Who I 
think should have better been respected. 
But fortune frowns on me 
As you all will plainly see, 
For I 
happen to be Molly Hill's rejected. 
CHORUS. 
0, dear, 0 ! I'm pining in grief and woe, 
To think the girl I 
loved could deceive me; 
MOLLY, 
HILL'S REJECTED . 
43 
And I 
groan beneath the smart of a 
broken heart. 
And ther&s :none, barring Molly, ca relieve me, 
I 
courted Molly long, 
And our love was firm and strong, 
If I 
entertained a 
doubt she would scold me; 
For she vowed she would be true, 
And stick to me like patent glue, 
And a 
host of other little fibs she told me. 
o, dear, 0, etc. 
And as all things have an end, 
So her love that way did tend, 
And she left me to wallow in dejection; 
For a 
filthy-looking snob, 
0, I 
long to squeeze his nob, 
Came and robbed me of Molly Hill's affection. 
0, dear, 6, etc. 
Now I 
don't incline to fight, 
Or in war at all delight, 
But this knocks my dander up completely; 
And I 
wish that I 
were stout, 
I 
would turn him inside out, 
Which only-WOUld be7Serving him 
discreetly. 
0, dear, 0, etc. 
I 
took her out to balls, 
And to first-class concert halls, 
And naught I 
should have done was neglected; 
I 
also gave her cash, 
Which indeed was rather rash, 
When now for all my kindness l'm rejected. 
0, dear, 0, etc. 
But she's not so much to blame 
As the snob, confound his name,

Which I 
never yet could utter without snarling, 
With his sweet and oily news, 
And his gifts of boots and shoes, 
lie has swindled me entirely of my darling. 
0, dear, 0, etc. 
Now some may think it strange, 
That I 
talk not of revenge, 
But fear is just the reason why I've halted; 
For the brute is seven feet three, 
Nearly twice the size of me, 
And could not very safely be assaulted. 
0, dear, 0, etc. 
So I 
must submit to fate, 
And with hope and patience wait, 
That other ways and means may be effected ; 
Which will with blessing tend, 
Set to rights again and mend 
The broken heart of Molly Hill's rejected. 
0, dear, 0, etc.

HARRY RICHMOND'S VERSION. 
Sung by M R. M ELVILLE. 
Air—" Ballet Girl." 
I'LL relate to you public the source of my woes, 
They're worse than hard blows, for nobody knows 
When with love the young heart like a 
cauliflower grows, 
And the girl don't care two-pence for you. 
The case it is mine, I am sorry to say, 
Through a 
girl—when I 
think my heart heaves— 
Whom I 
taught to dance in an exquisite way, 
And sing twice as well as Sim Reeves. 
SHE DANCED LIKE A FAIRY. 
enonus. 
She danced like a 
fairy, and sang like a 
bird, 
She did, on my word, but rather absurd, 
She doted on Pastor, a 
man that you've heard, 
And so she skedaddled from me. 
Then her father sold goods on a 
second-hand 'plan, 
lie had when he began_no meat in the pan, 
But from little to big he became a 
great man, 
And he now has a " hand-me-down" shop ; 
Coats, trousers and waistcoats for him she'd turn, 
And convert.the old shirts into new; 
When business was done, then her steps she'd learn, 
And dance in a 
suit of light blue. 
She danced like a 
fairy, etc. 
The first time that I 
met her, ' twas at her pa's shop, 
I 
outside (h(1 stop, then inside did poy, 
A twenty-dollar bill in her palm did drop,. 
Saying, " have you got a 
suit to fit me 7" 
She showed an assortment, hats, coats, boots as well, 
At last I 
chose these like a 
man, 
She said I 
looked handsome, in love with me fell, 
And from that time our courtship began. 
She danced like a 
fairy, etc. 
On each Saturday night I 
my clothes would redeem, 
It's just like a 
dream, so strange does it seem ; 
Just to think, we on Sundays look'd king and queen, 
When from Simpson's I'd borrow'd my clothes; 
He'd lend me my Chesterfield just for the day, 
And on Mondays I'd take him them back; 
The money spend on her, but to my dismay, 
One morning she gave me the sack. 
She danced like a 
fairy, etc.

MILK CAR. 
But Tony bought clothes at the same shop as me, 
And soon I 
could see with me ' twas all U—P ; 
He made friends with her father, and with them took tea, 
And he sang them his last comic songs. 
His soft winning ways her affections did win, 
And he thus took her feelings by storm; 
lie then brought her out, and he thus took me in, 
With him she's now learning to perform. 
31-ILIC CAR. 
As sung by HARRY RICHMOND. 
Air—" Railroad Car." • 
0, POLLY Basinet was a 
factory girl, 
And lived in Manchester, 
There she met young Bill, the milkman's son, 
Riding in the old milk car. 
Now Bill hp lived at the bottom of the hill, 
And Polly she lived with her ma ; 
'Twas going to the mill when she met young Bill, 
Riding in the old milk car. 
'Twas going, etc. 
They met every morn for about six months, 
Which clearly proved this ' ere, 
That Polly Basinet was dearly beloved 
By the chap in the old milk car. 
So one fine morn Bill made up his mind 
The question to pop to his dear; 
And the very next day he did that same, 
While riding in the old milk car. 
While riding, etc. 
Polly smiled and said, " My dearest Bill, 
If you will but prove true, 
SHELLING GREEN PEAS. 
I'll not say nay, but some fine day, 
Of course I'll marry you." 
So Bill and Polly they've got wed, 
And happy now they are, 
And Polly now a 
wife, is often to be seen 
While- riding in the old milk car. 
And Polly now, etc. 
SHELLING GREEN PEAS. 
As sung by IIAHRY RICHMOND. 
I 
SING you a 
ditty, of a 
damsel so pretty, 
Who liv'd from a 
city some seventeen miles; 
Her name is Maria, her worthy old sire 
Was clerk and town crier—his name was John Styles. 
With lips like the cherry, a 
smile, too, so merry, 
I 
thought her the very one suited to please, 
And when I 
first met her, and tried hard to get her, 
For worse or for better, she was shelling green peas. 
CHORUS. 
Under the trees, a_bowl on her knees, 
Maria sat silently shelling green peas. 
I'd long lov'd her dearly, truly, sincerely, 
At length I 
thought, really, I'd settle in life; 
Although aged fifty, I'd been very thrifty, 
And thought ' twas high time to be taking a 
wife. 
With bosom on fire in search of Maria, 
Thro' lanes of wild briar, o'ershadow'd by frees, 
I 
stroll'd to the spot where outside her cot there, 
She was sitting so patiently shelling green peas. 
Under the trees, etc. 
SHELLING GREEN PEAS. 
I 
stepp'd up unto her, commencing to woo her, 
I 
said, " That no truer fond heart could be found 
Than mine, if she'd take me some morning, and make me 
The happiest mortal for twenty miles round." 
I 
said, " Our life might be one round of delight." 
Like the little birds singing upon the green trees, 
To a 
whisper then dropped my voice without stopping, 
The question was popping as she popped the peas. 
Under the trees, etc. 
No answer she made, and I 
was much afraid 
That this beautiful maid had not heard all I 
said; 
At her feet kneeling, I 
tried to be stealing 
A kiss—when came reeling her hand on my head. 
" 
Do you think I'd engage," she cried out in'a rage, 
" 
With a 
man twice my age, so clear out if you please." 
In a 
terrible passion at me she sent crashing, 
On my head smashing the bowl of green peas. 
Under the trees, etc. 
By way of addenda, she said, " Sir, remember, 
That May and December can never unite. 
Your leave, sir, be taking." 
My neck nearly breaking, 
I 
made my escape in a 
terrible fright. 
I 
never will marry, but single will tarry, 
Tho' friends and acquaintances do nothing but tease. 
Whenever they meet me, in this style they greet me, 
" 
Old boy, what's the price of lamb and green peas ?" 
Yes how they tease, whenever th ey 
pl ease, 
I& shouting out after me, " Lamb and green peas." 
Under the trees, etc. 
Wily' is a 
lady harder on dresses than gentlemen'? 
Because, when she gets a 
new dress, she generally wears 
it out on the first day.

Sung by CHRISTY'S MINSTRELS. 
BEIIOLD a 
poor deluded man, 
A 
victim to deception; 
Forget my woes I 
never can, 
And I 
wander in dejection. 
I 
married once a 
nice young girl, 
ne'er forget the morn ; 
For, ever since how oft I've wished 
That I 
had ne'er been born. 
CHORUS. 
I 
loved her, and she might have been 
The happiest in the land ; 
But she fancied a 
foreigner who plays the flageolet, 
in the middle of a 
German band. 
She was all my fancy painted her, 
Her name was sweet Susannah, 
She could sing, she could dance, she could parley vous 
France, 
And could play upon the grand pianner. 
What a 
blissful honeymoon we spent ; 
To her none could have been kinder, 
For I 
made the bed, black-leaded the stove, 
While she played the " organ grinder." 
I 
loved her, etc. 
She'd play all the day, whilst I 
was away 
A 
slaving for the cash in the city ; 
And if any musicianers came down the street, 
On them she would take pity. 
So fond of the " food of love" was she, 
That she made them quite her hobbies, 
TUE GERMAN BAND. 
She'd often fill the street with German brass bands, 
'Till they were bundled off by the bobbies. 
I 
loved her, etc. 
Now there was a 
German band, three boys and a 
man, 
Who played every afternoon, 
They'd a " flageolet" in C, a " cornopean " in D, 
With a " sackbut " and a " trombone " out of tune ; 
They made an awful row, but still anyhow, 
They quite charmed the heart of Susannah; 
For she'd sit at the window whilst the German flageolet 
Used to wink in a 
most improper manner. 
I 
loved her, etc. 
Such goings on were not quite right, 
And so I 
gently told, her ; 
And tho' with rage my buzzom burned, 
I'd not the heart to scold her ; 
The very next day when I 
reached home, 
You might .have knocked me down with a 
brick, sirs, 
She'd bolted away with the German flageolet, 
And sold every blessed stick, sirs. 
I 
loved her, etc. 
Now this happy loving. 
couple did not love long, 
For ere they \
verb a 
fortnight older, 
They had a 
jolly row when the German flageolet, 
Went and listed for a 
Yankee soldier ; 
On the field of gl ory 
he got shot i
n the back ! 
But why should I 
now be caring, 
For the foreign ragamuffin he's a 
clay- cold corpus, 
And Susannah has to go out a 
charing. 
CHORUS. 
I 
loved her and she might have been, 
The happiest in the land, 
But now she goes a 
charing for eighteen pence a 
day, 
Thro' a 
fellow in a 
German band.

PRINCE THADY CORNELIUS McMURROUGH O'
TOOLE. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Air—" Darling Ould Stick." 
'Twits just at the moment I 
chanced to be born, 
Our dog lost his wits and our cow broke her horn, 
And ' mongst other omens the neighbors observed, 
Our cat was locked up in the cupboard and starved. 
My grandmother was a 
great lady, 
And she said to (mid Father O'Brady, 
Pray christen the beauty Prince Thady 
Cornelius McMurrough O'Toole. . 
From the Kings of ould Ireland descended am I, 
Though low my employment my lineage is high; 
My silks are all worsted, of frieze is my robe, 
A spade is my sceptre, a 
football my globe. 
My mother's a 
great McNamara, 
My cousin King David O'Hara, 
And my forefathers flourished in Tara 
'In the days of King Turlough O'Toole. 
Dame Fortune looks black and I 
bask in her frown, 
The son of a 
king, I'm scarce worth half a 
crown; 
Our jewels of state are lost amid strife, 
But Judy's the jewel and crown of my life. 
Stern poverty's self cannot bate us, 
Though fortune continues to chate us, 
And make all our bread and potatoes, 
Hard fare for the house of O'Toole. 
Of donkeys my dad kept an illigant stud, 
But I 
was the favorite prince of the blood; 
I 
don't mane myself with the donkeys to class, 
Who makes such a 
bull is himself but an ass. 
O'TOOLES IN A FIGHT . 
For the folks who are troubled with phthisic, 
The milk of the donkey's for physic, 
A 
mighty good thing when one is sick, 
Was amid by my daddy O'Toole. 
Great Shela NaGuira and ould Granerwile, 
Though females, fought each in a 
strong coat of mail, 
And some say the breeches were tacked to the coat, 
While they made smithereens of the spalpeens they 
smote. 
My grandmothers great grand-aunt's sisthers, 
They were as you'd read in registhers, 
As swordsmen renowned and as fisthers, 
Unmatched but by King Turlough O'Toole. 
O'TOOLES IN A 
FIGHT. 
As 
sung by TONY PASTOR as encore verses. 
LAST Donnybrook fair was the day of all days, 
When the clan of O'Toole met the Spalpeen O'Sheas; 
O'er the wide tented field both our armies were spread, 
The peace was soon broken and many a 
head. 
The O'Farrells, the Foys and OTagans, 
O'Flannagans, Rourkes and O'Regans, 
All scampered like so many pagans, 
From the friends of Prince Thady O'Toole. 
Great Murty McManus, NillOM few could resist 
Made a 
mighty good hand of his foot and his fist, 
And Barney O'Brien and Brian O'Flynn, 
Gave black eyes apiece to O'Quigley and Quinn: 
The .Murphy's, O'Moores and O'Maleys, 
Most gallantly twirled their shillalehs, 
And backed by the Hog,ans and Haley; 
Supported Prince Thady O'Toole. 
FAST MORSE. 
The scrimmage thus ended, away we all went 
To make ourselves merry in Ratfertey's tent, 
Where friends and relations fell out short and 
But peace I 
restored, for I 
walloped them all. 
With hearts then as light as a 
feather, 
They each seized a 
full flowing measure, 
And all drank in bumpers together, 
Long life to Prince Thady O'Toole. 
FAST HORSE. 
M R. PEABODY, did you see dat horse a , mine de oder

Yes, Clem; he looked to me rather a

Oh ! yes, Mr. Peabody; I

What do you mean, sir, by building him'? 
Why, making a 
horse! 
I've got de frame up already, 
Mr. Peabody; he's a 
fast horse. 
How fast can he go, Clem ? 
Thirty miles an hour. 
Gracious I 
thirty miles an hour? 
Why, sir, that is at 
the rate of a 
mile in two minutes. 
I 
know it, Mr. Peabody. 
Where did your horse make this extraordinary time 
Last week on de Erie Railroad; de horse was in de 
ladies' car. 
Clem, does your horse trot I 
Spot ? Yes, he's got a 
white spot near his left eye. 
I 
mean, sir, does he canter'? 
No, be don't drink out ob a 
decanter, he drinks out oh

You stupid nigger; I 
mean if you should sit in a 
wagon 
and pull on the reins. 
Why dat would kill de horse. 
MY SWEET KILKENNY GIRL. 
What would kill the horse, sir'? 
To sit in de wagon and pull on his brains. 
Clem, does your horse relish oats '1 
Oats'? why dat's a

How in the world do you manage to make a

Axe—" The Lazy Club." 
IT'S a 
pleasure thus to have a

'Bout which a

Love mostly occupies the mind, 
We all boast something of the kind. 
Nor freedom to the patriot, 
Nor liquor to the drunken sot, 
Nor nuts unto a

Are dear as my Kilkenny girl. 
CHORUS. 
She's the darling holds my heart, 
And never gave it cause to smart; 
Though she's not worth a

I'd marry her in Kilkenny, oh. 
Just look at her! and you can trace 
The smoke-brown hue upon her face. -

I'd prouder be than duke or earl, 
While praising my Kilkenny girl. 
She's the darling, etc. 
Each poet to describe his love, 
Has robbed the earth and heavens above, 
For rosy cheeks, and lips and eyes, 
The diamond stars and azure skies. 
I'll leave untold so you may guess. 
The beauty and the loveliness, 
When dressed in home-made neat appar'1, 
Of Kate my sweet Kilkenny girl. 
She's the darling, etc. 
We've often rambled in the shade, 
That hawthorn and sweet-brier made, 
And I 
felt proud when we'd pass by 
Jim Shea with vengeance in his eye, 
For if with fraud he'd cross love's course 
I 
fear I'd break through moral force 
With caubeen cock'd, my stick I'd twirl, 
And fight for my Kilkenny girl. 
She's the darling, etc. 
I've no big house nor spreading land, 
Nor man or horse at my command; 
My castle is icy cabin poor, 
Content and labor guard the door; 
To one thing more my love lays claim, 
And in return I 
ask the same, 
This rough frieze heart contains the pearl, 
An Irish heart, for an Irish girl.

And where's the drink so mild and cool

For whiskey good they've never seen,

RANTING, 
ROVING BLADE. 
As 
sung by TONY PASTOR. 
W HO° Pm a 
ranting, roving blade, 
Of never a 
thing was I 
ever afraid ; 
I'm a 
gintleman born, I'd scorn a 
trade, 
An' rd be a 
rich man if my debts were paid. 
But my debts are worth something—this tiuth they instil, 
That pride makes us fall all against our will ; 
For ' twas pride that broke me. I 
was happy until 
I 
was ruined all out by my tailor's bill. 
I'm the finest guide you ever did see, 
I 
know every place of curiosity, 
From Ballenafad to Donaghadee, 
An' if you're for sport, come along with me. 
I'll lead you sporting round about, 
We've wild ducks and widgeon, and snipe and trout, 
And I 
know where they are, and what they're about ; 
If they're not at home, then they're surely out. 
The miles in this country much longer be, 
But that is a 
saving of time, d'ye see 7 
For two of our miles is equal to three, 
Which shortens the road in a 
great degree. 
And the roads in this place are so plenty, we say 
That you've nothing to do but to find your way. 
If your hurry's not great and you've time to delay, 
You can go the short cut, that's the longest way. 
And I'll show you lots of good drinking, too, 
For I 
know the place where the whiskey grew, 
A 
bottle is good when it's not too new, 
And I'm fond of one, but I 
doat on two.

Truth is scarce when liars arc near, 
But squealing is plenty when pigs you shear, 
And mutton is high when cows are dear, 
And rint it is scarce four times a,year. 
Such a 
country for growing you'll never behould; 
We grow rich when we're poor, we grow hot when we're 
could, 
And the girls through bashfulness makes us grow bould, 
We grow young when we like, but we never grow ould. 
And the sivin small sinses grows natural here, 
For praties has eyes, and can see quite clear, 
And the kitties is singing with scalding tears, 
And the corn is listening with all its ears. 
But along with sivin sinses we have one more, 
Of which I 
forgot for to tell you before, 
'Tis nonsense spontaneously gracing our shore, 
And I'll tell you the rest when I 
think of more. 
A NICE LOT OF SIGHTS FOR A

As

Wtr AT a 
pleasure it is to have a.good wife, 
Now one who is able and willing, 
To cheer and to comfort a 
man through his life, 
One who knows how to eke out a 
stifling. 
Of my own little wife I 
can't grumble at all, 
But my family run enough, rather, 
Thirteen boys and girls. I 
have got, great and small, 
And that's a 
nice sight for a 
father. 
Fol de rol lol, etc. 
There's Anna Maria, a 
young woman grown, 
The Lord knows I 
wish she would marry, 
64 
A NICE LOT OF SIGHTS FOR A FATHER . 
She goes out every night (I 
can't keep her at home), 
With a 
young chap who calls himself Harry, • 
In the street, Vother evening, I 
bolted her tight, 
Upon the door I 
put a 
bar there, 
When she said, " Let me in, or I'll stop out all night." 
Now there was a 
sight for a 
father. 
For de rol lol, etc. 
Our Torn is so proud that he vowed he would be 
Either a 
Squire or a 
Knight, sirs, 
So to better his fortune he bolted from me, 
And for many years kept out o' sight, sirs. 
I 
went in a 
shop to get shaved. Vother day, 
My chin was soon covered with lather; 
When I 
found it was Toni a- scraping away. 
Now there was a 
sight for a 
lather. 
Fol do rol lol, etc. 
There's my daughter Bet, the worst of them yet, 
She might have married a 
rich man, 
But she seemed taken up with a 
queer looking chap, 
Whose profession, I 
think, was a 
fish-man. 
In the street fother day, sirs, Lord, how I 
did stare, 
'Twas an awkward predicament, rather, 
She was crying out, ' Catfish !—a 
shilling a 
pair." 
Oh, there was a 
sight for a 
father. 
Fol de rol lol, etc. 
Now all married men, just take my advice, 
And if you would keep your homes right, sirs, 
Don't let your daughters dress up over nice, 
Nor your sons run about after night, sirs. 
Keep your girls at their needles, your boys at their pens. 
Now I've brought my experience dear, rather, 
By all means keep the girls away from the men, 
Or they'll soon be sights for a 
father.

FATHER MALLOY.

FATHER MALLOY . 
Sung by CHRISTY'S M INSTRELS. 
PADDY McCabe was dying one day, 
And Father Malloy he came to confess him ; 
Paddy pray'd hard he would make no delay, 
But forgive him his sins, and make haste for to bless 
him. 
" 
First tell me your sins," says Father Malloy, 
" 
For I'm thQing you've not been a 
very good boy ;" 
" 
Oh", says Paddy, " so late in the even' I 
fear, 
'Twould trouble you such a 
long story to hear ; 
For you've ten long miles o'er the mountain to go, 
While the road _
eve to travel's much longer you know ; 
So give us your blessin' and get in the saddle, 
To tell all my sins my poor brain it would addle, 
And the docthor gave orders to keep me so quiet, 
'Twould disturb me to tell all my sins if I'd thry it, 
And your riv'rence has towld us unless we tell a//, 
It is worse than not makin' confession at all ; 
So I'll say in a 
word, I'm no very good boy, 
And therefore your blessin'. sweet Father Malloy. 
Father Malloy, Father Malloy; 
And therefore your blessin', sweet Father Malloy." 
" 
Well, I'll read from a 
book," says Father Malloy, 
" 
The manifold sins humanity's heir to, 
And when you hear those your conscience annoy, 
You'll just squeeze my hand as acknowledging thereto." 
Then the Father began the dark veil of iniquity. 
And Paddy thereat felt his conscience grow rickety; 
And he gave such a 
squeeze that the priest gave a 
roar, 
" 
Oh ! murdher," says Paddy " don't read any more ; 
For if you keep readin' by all that is thrue, 
Your rev'rence's fist will be soon black and blue; 
Besides, to be throubled my conscience begins, 
That your rev'renco should have any hand in my sins. 
66 
IPATrf ER MALLOY. 
So you'd better suppose I 
committed them all, 
For whether they're great ones or ' whether they're small, 
Or if they're a .dozen or if they're four score, 
It's your rev'rence knows how to absolve them asthore; 
And therefore your blessin' sweet Father Malloy. 
Father Malloy, Father Malloy; . 
And therefore your blessin' sweet Father Malloy." 
" 
Well," says Father Malloy, " if your sins I 
forgive, 
So you must forgive all your enemies truly; 
And promise me also, that if you should lite, 
You'll leave off your old tricks and begin to live newly." 
" 
I 
forgive everybody," says Pat, with a 
groan, 
" 
Except that big vaaabone, Mickey Malone, 
And him I 
will murdher if ever I 
can." 
" 
Tut, tut," says the priest, " you're a 
very had man, 
For without your forgiveness and also repentance, 
You'll ne'er go to heaven, and that is my sentence." 
" 
Pooh," says Paddy McCabe, " that's a 
very hard case, 
With your rev'rence and heaven I'm content to make 
peace; 
But with heav'n and your rev'rence I 
wonder, och hone! 
You would think of comparin' that blackguard Malone; 
But since I'm hard pressed and that I 
must forgive, 
I 
forgive—if I 
die—but, as sure as I 
live, 
That ugly blackguard I 
will surely destroy, 
And now for your blessin', sweet Father Malloy. 
Father Malloy, Father Malloy; 
And now for your blessin', sweet Father Malloy." 
JENKS says husbands who habitually leave their wives 
alone to attend clubs, have club on the brain, and ought 
to have it on the skull.

67, 
THE JOCKEY HAT AND FEATHER.: 
AS 
sung by W. N. 
SMITH, the great bone-player of aULET'S Circus. 
As I 
was walking out one day, 
Thinking of the weather, 
I 
saw a 
pair of roguish eyes 
'Neath a 
hat and feather. 
She looked at me, I 
looked at her, 
It made my heart pit-pat; 
Then, turning round, she said to me, 
How do you like my hat 
CHORUS. 
Oh! I 
said, it's gay, and pretty, too. 
They look well together, 
Those glossy curls and jockey hat, 
With a 
rooster's feather. 
She wore a 
handsome broad-cloth basque, 
Cut in the latest fashion, 
And flounces all around her dress 
Made her look quite dashing. 
Her high-heeled boets, as she walked on 
The pavement, went pit-pat. 
I'll ne'er forget the smile I 
saw, 
Beneath that jockey hat ! 
Oh, I 
said, it's gay, etc. 
She kissed her hand, said, Au revoir ! 
Then I 
was a 
goner; 
Before I'd time to say, Good-bye, 
She was round the corner. 
I 
tried that night, but could not sleep, 
So, up in bed I 
sat, 
And right before my face I 
thought 
I 
saw that jockey hat! 
Oh, I 
said, it's gay, etc.

A IR—" She had such a 
Delicate Way." 
I COURTE D a 
nice young girl; I'll tell you, if I 
can, 
The whole affair as it occurred with me and Mary Ann. 
She was a 
blooming girl, as charming as could .be, 
And these words she always said, She loved no one like 
me. 
CHORUS . 
Do you really think she did, she did 1 
do you really 
think she (lid 1 
Oh, tell me, if you'll be so kind, do you really think she 
did? 
I 
used to take my Mary Ann to every ball and rout, 
In fact, I 
spent all the cash I 
had in taking"her about. 
She was very fond of oysters, she'd eat till all was blue ; 
She said, It's not the fish I 
like, my dear, ' tis only you. 
Do you really think she did ? etc. 
This charming girl told me that on a 
sick friend she 
would call, 
I 
thought I'd have a 
jolly spree, so went to a 
fancy ball. 
The first I 
saw was Mary Ann upon a 
young man's knee, 
And when I asked her what it meant, she said, she 
thought ' twas me. 
Do you really think she did 
etc. 
At last, I 
was persuaded this fair girl to Nired ; 
And, for the first month a 
pleasant life was led ; 
When, strange to say, but it is a 
fact, ere the close of the 
honey-moon. 
My Mary Ann said she'd have her own way which I 
thought was rather soon. 
Don't you really think it was ? etc. 
69 
IF YOUR FOOT IS FltETTY, SHOW IT . 
I 
went home rather soon, one night, when such a 
sight 
was seen ; 
There sat my spouse with her arm round the neck of a 
horse- marine ! 
Says I 
to her, I 
won't stand that, your conduct is not 
right. 
Says Mary Ann, Don't be a 
fool, it's my cousin, Sergeant 
White. 
Do you really think it was ? etc. 
At last, one morning, off she went; I 
shall De'er forget 
the day; 
She'd sold every stick I 
had, and left me the bills to pay; 
A 
note she left behind, in which she said, ' Tis all serene, 
She could not live with such a 
flat, I 
was so very green ! 
Do you really think I 
was 1 
etc. 
IF YOUR FOOT IS PRETTY, SHOW IT. 
As sung by W. N. SMITH, the great bone-player of BAILEY'S Circus. 
IF 
your foot is pretty, show it, 
No matter where, or when ; 
Let all fair maidens know it, 
The foot takes all the men.: 
The face, so fair and lovely, 
May charm the gazer's eye, 
But if the foot is homely, 
he'll quickly pass you by, 
He'll quickly, he'll quickly, 
he'll quickly pass you.by. 
If your foot is pretty, show it, 
If you wish to catch a 
beau ; 
No longer hide the tell- tale charm, 
Beneath so many clothes; 
PADDLE YOUR OWN CANOE. 
The figure may deceive you, 
All hooped and padded o'er; 
But let me but survey the foot, 
I'll ask to see no more, 
I'll ask, I'll ask— 
I'll ask to see no more. 
If your foot is pretty, show it, 
When you trip along the street; 
For it will catch the eager eyes 
Of every man you meet; 
Don't toss your glossy ringlets, 
Nor pout your lips so sweet, 
But gently lift your petticoats, 
And show your handsome feet, 
And show, and show— 
And show your handsome feet. 
PADDLE YOUR OWN CANOE. 
I'VE travell'd about a 
bit in my time, 
And of troubles I've seen. a 
few, 
But found it better, in ev'ry clime, 
To paddle my own canoe; 
My wants are small, I 
care not at all, 
If my debts are paid when due ; 
I 
drive away strife, in the ocean of life, 
While I 
paddle my own canoe. 
CHORUS. 
Then love your neighbor as yourself, 
As the world you go travelling through, 
And never sit down with a 
tear or a 
frown, 
But paddle your own canoe. 
LINDA'S GONE TO BALTIMORE. 
71 
I 
have no wife to bother my life, 
No lover to prove untrue; 
But the whole day long, with a 
laugh and a 
song, 
I 
paddle my own canoe. 
I 
rise with the lark, and from daylight till dark, 
I 
do what I 
have to do; 
1 
I'm careless of wealth, if I've only the health 
To paddle my own canoe. 
Then love your, etc. 
It's all very well to depend on a 
friend, 
That is, if you've proved him true ; 
But you'll find it better by far in the end, 
To paddle your own canoe. ` 
To BORROW is dearer by far than to BUY, 
A maxim tho' old, still true ; 
You never will sigh if you only will try, 
To paddle your own canoe. 
Then love your, etc. 
If a 
hurricane rise in the mid-day skies, 
And the sun is lost to view, 
Move steadily by, with a 
steadfast eye, 
And paddle your own canoe. 
The daisies that grow in the bright green fields, 
Are blooming so sweet for you; 
So never sit down, with a 
tear or a 
frown, 
But paddle your own canoe. 
Then love your, etc.
