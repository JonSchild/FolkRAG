DEAR LITTLE SHAMROCK 
SONGSTER. 
THE DEAR LITTLE SHAMROCK. 
Sung by MISS JENNIE ENGEL, in PASTOR'S TOUT Around The 
World. 
THERE'S a 
dear little plant that grows in our Isle, 
'Twas St. Patrick himself sure, that set it; 
And the sun on his labor with pleasure did smile, 
And with dews from his eyes often wet it. 
It thrives through the bog, through the brake, through 
. 
the mireland, 
And they call it the dear little shamrock of Ireland. 
'Tis the dear little shamrock, 
The green little shamrock, 
The sweet little, dear little 
Shamrock of Ireland. 
That dear little plant still grows in our land, 
Fresh and fair as the daughters of Erin; 
Whose smiles can bewitch, whose eyes can command, 
In each climate that each shall appear in. 
NORA. 
O'NEAL. 
7 
C 
HE VOWED HE NEVER WOULD LEAVE M r, 
It thrives through the bog, through the brake, through 
the mireland, 
Just like the dear little shamrock of Ireland. 
'Tis the dear little shamrock, 
The sweet little shamrock, 
The dear little, green little 
Shamrock of Ireland. 
HE VOWED HE NEVER WOULD LEAVE ME. 
As 
sung by JENNIE EN'OEL 
PLEASE to look on me, say am I 
bold? 
Yet behold I've been sold; 
And in sure when my story I've told, 
Badly treated I've been, you will say, 
By a 
chap who was called Thomas James; 
Thomas James was his name. 
And I 
hope I'll not meet him again, 
Toodle tum,toodle turn tay. 
Chorus. 
Though he vowed he never would leave me, 
Yet I'm sure he meant to deceive me; 
Toodle turn, toodle turn, toodle turn, 
Toodle turn, toodle turn, toodle turn tay. 
I 
first met this chap in the park, 
In the park, what a 
lark! 
He ventured to make a 
remark 
That it was a 
very cold day. 
To which I 
replied, not too bold, 
That it was very cold; 
His name and address then he told, 
Toodle turn, toodle turn tay. 
Though he vowed, etc. 
Says he, " Charming girl, name the day, 
Only say when the day;" 
So I 
spoke up, and said, " Right away, 
I'll marry you now, Thomas James." 
But the very next day on the street, 
I 
did meet, I 
did meet, 
This chap, with a 
girl, talking sweet, 
Toodle turn, toodle turn tay. 
Though he vowed, etc. 
Says I, " Thomas James, this looks queer, 
Very queer, talking here;" 
When he turned round and said, " Wifey dear, 
Send this crazy woman away." 
Then / spoke up, and said, " Cruel man, 
Look at me if you can ;" 
But he took to his heels, and he ran, 
Toodle turn, toodle turn tay. 
Though he vowed, etc. 
NORA O'NEAL. 
As sung originally at PASTOR'S Opera House, by Miss JENNIE 
ENGEL. 
Oh! I'm lonely to-night love, without you, 
And I 
sigh for one glance of your eye; 
For, sure there's a 
charm, love, about you, 
Whenever I 
know you are nigh. 
Like the beam of the star when 'tis smiling, 
Is the glance which your eye can't conceal. 
And your voice is so sweet and beguiling 
That I 
love you, sweet Nora O'Neal 
Chorus. 
Oh! don't think that ever I'll doubt you, 
My love I 
will never conceal, 
Oh! I'm lonely to-night, love without you, 
3Iy darling, sweet Nora O'Neal! 
8 
CONSTANTEcOPLE. 
Oh! the nightingale sings in the wildwood, 
As if every note that he knew 
Was learned from your sweet voice in childhood, 
To remind me, sweet Nora, of you. 
But I 
think, love, so often about you, 
And You don't know how happy I 
feel, 
But I'm lonely to-night, love, without you, 
My darling, sweet Nora O'Neal! 
Oh! don't think, etc. 
Oh! why should I 
weep tears of SOITOW 
Oh! why to let hope lose its place ? 
Won't I 
meet you, my darling, to-morrow, 
And smile on your beautiful face ? 
Will you meet me ? 
Oh! say you will meet me 
With a 
kiss at the foot of the lane, 
And 
promise whenever you greet me 
That I'll never be lonely again. 
Oh! don't think, etc. 
CONSTANTINOPLE. 
As 
sung by M iss JENNIE ENGEL. 
KIND friends, your pity now bestow, 
On one who stands before you; 
And listen to ray tale of woe, 
Though I 
promise not to bore you. 
I 
longed to be a 
soldier's bride, 
In my heart there burnt ambition's flame, 
For I 
loved a 
gay young colonel, who 
From Constantinople came, 
Constantinople, Constantinople, 
Constantinople the colonel came. 
Chorus. 
C-0-N, with a 
con, S-T-A-N, with a 
stan, 
With a 
constan, T-I 
ti, with a 
constanti, 
N-0 no, with a 
no, with a 
constantino, 
-L-E, with a 
pull, Constantinople. 
CAN'T COME TO TIME. 
9 
I 
met the colonel at the ball, 
To me he was presented; 
Upon his knees the youth did fall, 
And lots of stuff invented. 
He said he was a 
Turkish Prince, 
And begged that I 
would bear his name 
So I 
accepted the young colonel, 
Who from Constantinople came; 
Constantinople, Constantinople, 
Constantinople the colonel came. 
CON, with the con, etc. 
One evening while we sat at tea, 
We'd a 
visit quite informal; 
The police came, and gracious me, 
They took away my colonel! 
I 
soon found he a 
swindler was, 
And long had carried on that game; 
So I 
lost the gay young colonel, 
Who. from Constantinople came; 
Constantinople, Constantinople, 
Constantinople the colonel came. 
CON, with a 
con, etc. 
CAN'T COME TO TIME. 
As sung by Miss JENNIE ENGEL. 
Am—" 
Grandfather's Days." 
NEW sayings come up every day, as you will hear. 
By the young and the old, by the gay and the queer; 
All the last ones you'll hear, both here and abroad; 
Like " I 
can't stand the press," or, " Get out, you're a 
fraud." 
But there is a 
new one, my attention does call, 
I 
think it's the best, it lays over them all; 
To prove I 
am right, I 
have placed it in rhyme, 
The subject I've got, is, I 
can't come to time. 
10 
CAN'T COMM TO TIME. 
The polititian so bold, who for office does seek, 
He addresses the humble, the rich, and the meek; 
He boasts what he'll do, when for office selected, 
Says he'll bring down the tax, when he is elected. 
But the people know well to blow he's inclined, 
That to fill up his pockets are the thoughts of his mind; 
And when in the rear, he sees he's behind, 
He says, " I'm a 
flat, and I 
can't come to time." 
A 
young man so gay starts to cut quite a 
dash, 
Finds his pockets are low, for he's run out of cash; 
As he's on the mash, and wants a 
young girl to catch, 
He's forced to a 
broker's, to shove up his watch. 
The time it expires, for which the loan's sought, 
The pockets are empty again of the sport. 
He goes for the watch, but the broker is prime, 
Says, " I 
can't see the point, for you can't come to 
time." 
A 
lady so fair, who looks meek as a 
dove, 
Sends a 
thrill through your heart, and you fall deep in 
love; 
Faint heart never won, so you take a 
bold stand, 
You call at her house, and ask for her hand; 
You offer to take her for better or worse. 
She instantly asks you the length of your purse, 
You say you are poor, " No fortune is mine ;" 
When she says with a 
sneer, " You can't come to time." 
Our yachts are the fleetest the world ever saw, 
Our horses the fastest that lay upon straw; 
The ladies, the dear ones, beat all the world through, 
With ankle-boots, bahnorals, tilting-hoops too. 
Our city a 
fair one by night or by day; 
If you doubt what I 
say, take a 
walk down Broadway, 
And there you will see the new City Hall fine, 
"us not completed, for it can't come to time. 
We'll soon have a 
tunnel to Brooklyn, you know, 
Then no more on the ice you'll be found for to go. 
BEAT YOUR IsTEIGHBOE. 
11 
And also a 
railway beneath our Broadway, 
And likewise horse-cars over head, so they say. 
In improvement and war we are top of the heap, 
In stating the fact, don't consider me steep; 
For if foreign nations try with us for to shine, 
They'll find they're played out, and can't come to time. 
BEAT YOUR NEIGHBOR. 
Written by W. B. CAVANAGH, and sung by Miss JENNIE ENGEL. 
—" 
Paddle your own Canoe.” 
No doubt you all have heard about, 
A 
song that is quite new; 
A 
popular bye-word, now the rage, 
Called, " Paddle your own Canoe." 
It speaks of loving every one, 
And of right that we should do; 
But the motto is for every one, 
To paddle his own canoe. 
Chorus. 
Then beat your neighbor all you can, 
No matter what you do; 
For they all look out for number one. 
And paddle their own canoe. 
The politician, when elected, 
As governor of a 
State, 
Receives a 
bribe at any time, 
Of which he does not prate. 
He pockets the fee, unlocks the cell, 
And sets a 
criminal free; 
For what cares he for crime or sin, 
When greenbacks he can see. 
Then beat, etc. 
12 
BELLY GILIXES. 
A 
policeman, too, while taking his rounds, 
Sees a 
thief with plenty of swag, 
Stealing away from a 
jeweller's store, 
With the contents of a 
large bag. 
He seizes the thief, and says, " My lad, 
Comes halves, or I 
will blow; 
They share the spoils, the M. P. chuckles, 
He paddles his own canoe. 
Then beat, etc. 
The newspapers, too, oft change their tunes, 
When they are required to write;. 
Their politics change in one short year, 
By the weight of golden might. 
The editor smokes in his arm-chair, 
And reads his paper through; 
He counts the lies which gain the prize, 
To paddle his own canoe. 
Then beat, etc. 
The alderman, too, receives a 
bribe, 
The judge, the preacher too; 
They all look out for number one, 
And paddle their own canoe. 
For the rich are great, the poor despised, 
No matter what you do, 
Make money, you'll find it's your best friend, 
To paddle your own canoe. 
Then beat, etc. 
SA414   
BILLY GRIMES. 
As sung by Miss JENNIE ENGEL. 
TO-MOIlltOW morn I'm sweet sixteen, 
And Billy Grimes the drover, 
Has popped the question to my ma, 
And wants to be my lover. 
To-morrow morn, he says mamma, 
He's coming here quite early, 
To take a 
pleasant walk with me, 
Across the fields of barley. 
You must not go, my daughter dear, 
There' s 
no use now in talking, 
You shall not go across the field, 
With Billy Grimes a-walking. 
To think of his presumption, too, 
The dirty, ugly drover. 
I 
wonder -where your pride has gone, 
To think of such a 
rover. 
Old Grimes is dead, you know mamma, 
And Billy is so lonely; 
Besides they say, of Grimes' estate, 
That Billy is the only 
Surviving heir to all that's left, 
And that they say is nearly 
A 
good ten thousand dollars, ma, 
Besides six hundred yearly. 
I 
did not hear, my daughter dear, 
Your last remark quite clearly; 
For Billy is a 
clever chap, 
And no doubt loves you dearly. 
Then don't forget, to-morrow morn, 
To be up bright and early, 
And take a 
pleasant walk with him, 
Across the fields of barley. 
CHAMPAGNE CHARLEY. 
As sung by Miss JENNIE ENGEL. 
SomErnuE ago I 
had a 
beau, 
And Charley was his name, 
A. smart young fellow, fond of show, 
Who wished my hand to claim; 
But from my feet, I 
spurned this swell, 
Ks I 
will now explain. 
Although he loved me very well, 
He better loved champagne. 
Chorus. 
Ohampag,ne Charley was his name, 
Champagne Charley was his name; 
Always kicking up a 
frightful noise, 
Always kicking up a 
frightful noise. 
Champagne Charley was his name, 
Champagne Charley was his name; 
Kicking up a 
row at night, boys, 
Always ready for a 
spree. 
One moment still he couldn't rest, 
He passed whole nights and days 
In drinking Madame Clicquot's best, 
And smoking Henry Clay's. 
And then when home to bed he'd go, 
With wild disordered brain, 
He'd lay it to his studies, 
Though I 
know it was champagne. 
Champagne Charley, etc. 
His cash did quickly disappear; 
Which did not well suit me; 
For champagne's dear—had he drank beer, 
Things different now had been. 
I 
might have been his slave for life, 
But now 'tis all in vain, 
For how can he require a 
wife, 
When wedded to champagne? 
Champagne Charley, etc. 
Which is the most powerful, the earth or the sea? 
• 
The sea, of course, it has such heaps of mussels, 
I WANT A. 
BEAU. 
15 
I'LL TELL NOBODY. 
As 
sung by MISS JENNIE ENGEL. g 
OH, I 
am in love, but I 
won't tell with who, 
For I 
know very well what the fair ones would do; 
They chatter and clatter, and make themselves fine. 
And poor little some one would have a 
sad time. 
Chorus.. 
So I'll tell nobody, I'll tell nobody, 
Nobody, nobody, nobody, no. 
I'll tell nobody, 
tell nobody; 
Nobody, nobody, nobody no, 
If I 
tell it to one, she will tell it to two. 
And the next cups of tea, they would plot what to do 
And as men have no constancy in their own mind, 
He'd seek a 
new face, and leave some one behind. 
So I'll tell, etc. 
There's one thing I'll tell you, he's not over tall. 
Unless you should see him, he's not very small; 
I 
met him last night, and he pulled off my glove, 
So I 
think you can guess who is somebody's love. 
So I'll tell, etc. 
I 
WANT A 
BEAU. 
As sung by Miss JENZ,IIE ENGEL. 
I

To waltz or walk, or sail or row,

And oft I

She oft replies, " Oh no, no, no, 
You are too young to marry."

Within whose bosom coldly flows 
The stream of love, to belles and beaux, 
Who have a

I

I

This very night to tell his flame; 
He called me every pretty name, 
And asked me if I'd marry. 
I 
blushed, as every modest maid, 
On such occasions will, and said, 
" 
Ohl dear, I

I

Song or Duett, as sung in THE BLACK Cnoon, also sung by Miss 
JENNIE ENGEL. 
Am—" 
Pretty Little Sarah." 
EARLY in the morning, at the break of day, 
When the balmy breezes blow, 
• 
IT'S WONDERFUL HOW WE DO IT, BUT WE DO. 
17 
I 
went a-roaming through the fields away, 
Early in the morning, merrily 0! 
'Twas then I 
met you, Caroline, coming towards me; 
Oh! such 
pretty girl you seemed to me, 
My heart began to beat as it never beat before, 
Oh! I 
would give the world if we ne'er part forever more. 
Chorus, 
For early in the morning at the break of day, 
When the balmy breezes blow, 
We will go a-roaming through the fields away, 
Early in the morning, merrily 0! 
Early in the morning, at the break of day, 
When the balmy breezes blow, 
You go roaming through the fields away, 
Early every morning, merrily 0! 
But at every turning, and every place I 
pass, 
With hope my heart is burning to meet you, pretty lass. 
And when I 
do meet you, I'm resolved without delay, 
To take a 
kiss from those sweet lips, that named the 
wedding day. 
For early, etc.

And what he's done in every land, I'll soon make you 
understand, 
It's wonderful how we do it, but we do. 
Mexico has gone to grass, John Bull is o'er the seas, 
Napoleon has played out his little game; 
Our yachts have gained the day, o'er old ocean got the 
sway, 
And made the British sailors blush with shame. 
We 
first made the telegraph, at which ignorant folks did 
laugh, 
And we did away with gold to help us through; 
We feed the folks of every clime, and knock all nations 
out of time, 
It's wonderful how we do it, but we do, 
We made greenbacks to suit the times, when deficient 
of the dimes. 
Brought the bonds of the Fenians up to par; 
Gave Kossaith all his cash, did away with whip and lash, 
And o'er the mighty nigger went to war. 
With one Monitor we frightened all the nations of the 
world, 
'Twas a 
lesson to John Bull, and French Crapeau; 
And they trembled at the sight of our starry flag un-
furled, 
It's wonderful how we do it, but we do. 
Opera singers we import, give the niggers chance to vote, 
IVe've a 
country from the tropics to the pole; 
Where the Union banner flies, and all the world defies, 
Of progress tis the very life and soul. 
All foreign nations soon, will go up in a 
balloon, 
We'll destroy them with our doctrine of Monroe; 
Lord how quick they will be beat, if we give them 
naught to eat, 
It's wonderful how we do it, but we do.

THE SNEEZING SONG. 
As sung by Miss JENNIE ENGEL. 
YE 
gentlemen and ladies fair, 
On my affliction pity take; 
For when I 
show the greatest care, 
A 
perfect sound I 
cannot make. 
I 
stammer when I 
try to sing 
The more I 
strive, the worse it grows, 
Oh! it is like a 
little sting, 
This tickling in my nose. 
Chorus. 
Tra in la, tra la la la, train lid lal ah, 
Tra In lal lal ah, tra in in, tra la In, 
lira in lal, lal lal lal ah. 
[Sneeze. 
I 
try the malady to cure, 
With drugs and potions day by day, 
And still the evil I 
endure, 
Although a 
year has rolled away, 
The drinks I 
take disturb my heart, 
And if I 
snuff, oh! horrid woes, 
It seems my senses will depart, 
This tickling in my nose. 
Tra, in In, etc. 
If I 
to a 
soiree dare to go, 
With a 
gentleman of manners fine, 
And they should ask a 
sweet moreeau, 
I 
could not sing a 
single line, 
My voice it then begins to fail, 
The company impatient grows, 
They say it is of no avail, 
This tickling in my nose. 
Tra in in, ete.

And one across the ocean wide, his name is Pat Malloy. 
His mother keeps a 
huckster shop, well known for miles 
around, 
And search the country through and through, her 
equal can't be found; 
But ala,s! the times came very hard, the landlord raised 
the rent, 
And Pat to live in idleness could no longer be content. 
He came and asked a 
question, and I 
answered, " Yes; 
I 
will," 
He kissed me. many times, as if he'd never get his fill; 
Oh! God will surely bless him, and protect my darling 
Joy, 
Till he comes back to Ireland, and his Mary of Fermoy. 
He left Fermoy for England, and there across the sea 
For good Columbia's happy shores, blest land of lib:.

Where Erin's sons are not the slaves of landlord or of 
queen, 
And where they can' without offence wear their coun-

For he has promised me his heart, and I 
know that he 
has mine; 
And now he's coming home again, to visit dear Fernley, 
Then Father Boyce will change my name, to Mistress

For my Billy Jones, the butcher. 
The first time that he saw this gal, 
'Twas in a 
pouring rain; 
She sought the. shelter of his stand, 
And he was not to blame. 
She ogled and she winked at him, 
Till she won his heart away, 
She coaxed him to elope with her, 
To Jersey the next day. 
But he's gone away, etc. 
Next morning as aftmg Broadway, 
I 
was walking quite serene, 
I 
saw this gal and Billy Jones, 
Driving a

Who bleated out good-bye; 
And the peanut gal who is now his bride, 
At me she winked one eye.

THE GIRL THAT LOOKED LIKE ME.

Tan ladies now are bard to read,

And well the young men here do know , 
How they will plague and tease. 
'Tis not for me to tell their faults, 
But all my beaux agree, 
How difficult it is to find 
A 
gal that looks like me. 
Chorus. 
I'm sorry I 
did meet her, 
And with me you'll agree, 
The greatest trouble ere I 
met, 
Was the girl that looked like me. 
But my attractions once did cause, 
Some trouble to befall, 
And if you'll list a moment, 
Why, I 
will tell you all. 
I 
saw a 
female passing by, 
With myself you would agree, 
That in dress, in face, in everything, 
This girl, she looked like me, 
I'm sorry, etc.

"Kind sir, do you know Mrs. Smith,

Then good gracious! I

This girl that looked like me. 
I'm sorry, etc. 
I 
could not move from where I 
stood, 
I 
knew not what to do; 
I 
saw the gentleman come back, 
To me he came up too. 
He rudely took me by the arm, 
Saying, " I've got you fast, you see." 
I 
fell upon my knees and said, 
"Twas the girl that looked like me." 
I'm sorry, etc. 
In vain I 
told my story, 
But no one would believe; 
They said my countenance was ono 
Just made for to deceive. 
A 
policeman took me by the arm, 
Till, good gracious! what did I 
see, 
Coming out of Simpson's, the woman with 
the watch, 
The girl that looked like me. 
I'm sorry, etc. 
Of course they soon released me, 
And away with her they went, 
‘Before Judge Dowling at the Tombs, 
Who her to prison sent. 
'Tis now she's serving out her time, 
In two years she'll be free, • 
But never once will I 
forget,

His mother's dear joy, quite a

Does she know you are out, now, Augustus do tell ? 
He is proud of' his name, has earned great fame, 
Of money and houses, he's got quite a 
lot; 
He sends Inc bouquets on all holidays, 
But it's only a 
way Augustus has got. 
Now here is another that is known to me too, 
Now don't look so sheepish, I 
really mean you; 
Sweet William the saint, I 
think you use paint, 
For your face looks just now most horribly blue. 
Ho is very attentive, has nice winning ways, 
But e. shoe-brush right under his nose he has got; 
To improve his figure. they say he wears stays, 
But it's only a 
way that sweet William has got. 
Now there is John Smith, he sits on the left, 
lie's got his wife's shawl on, quite plain to our sight; 
But when he goes home, he'll pick a

We trust most sincerely to see you again; 
I

But it's meant as a

The boys in the gallery so oft loudly yell, 
And call us out, whether we will or not; 
They think it great fun, but mean us no harm; 
For it's only a

On the 5th of December, they had a 
large meeting, 
In Dublin's big city, I'm sure I 
don't brag; 
And across the wide waters they sent us this greeting, 
Old Ireland is true to the American flag. 
At that meeting the chairman passed these resolutions, 
Resolving our people, when forced for to roam, 
On America's soil met a 
free institution, 
With the right hand of friendship, they there found a 
home. 
A 
home with the rights of a 
citizen gifted, 
Free from all tyrants as ever can be, 
And the hand of old Ireland shall never be lifted, 
To strike a 
foul blow 'gainst the flag of the free.

And her troubles an Irishman always will share; 
For in the late war they marched on to defend her, 
In an Irish brigade, led by brave Francis Meagher. 
Then here's to the fair land of freedom, God bless her 
And here's to the might of our arm which dwells; 
Too long we have fought to uphold the oppressor, 
The time has now come, we must fight for ourselves. 
Then off with the chain with which the tyrant hath

And liberty ever our watchword shall be; 
But the sword in the scabbard shall never be sheathed, 
Till old Ireland Jpecomes like AMERICA, free.

He joined the boys so merry, 
And fought against the red coats, 
And the sneaking peelers too. 
By superior force surrounded, 
Bamboozled and confounded, 
And lodged into the county jail, 
Was my poor Paudeen Rhue. 
To Van Dieman's land they sent him,

No five hundred dollar shawls were worn, 
Nor diamonds made of paste;

Our grandmothers used no paddings then, 
I;or short skirts their feet to show; 
They had no tilting hoops, no waterfalls, 
A

And each young man that you would meet, 
Never went upon the ear; 
Nor stood for hours before the glass, 
To curl and fix their hair. 
They never dyed their moustaches. 
Nor in tight pants made a 
show; 
And they had no paper collars then, 
A 
hundred years ago. 
No watch chains made of brass were worn, 
No handkerchiefs of lace; 
And no young fellows then wore stays, 
To make a 
pretty waist. 
No patent- leather boots were worn, 
To force a 
corn to grow, 
And they had no dollar jewelry, 
A 
hundred years ago. 
Gift enterprises then were scarce, 
To take away your dimes; 
They cider drank, and not champagne, 
Oh ! those were happy times. 
Nor every foreign murder read, 
Ere out of bed you'd go; 
But they had no Atlantic telegraph,

OH; LONG BRANCH IS THE PLACE TO RURALIZE. 
As stung by Miss JENSIIFENGEL. 
OH 
Long Branch is the place to ruralize, 
Ritituralize, extramuralize ; 
Long Branch is the place to ruralize, 
Upon a 
summer's day. 
There you can take a 
ramble, 
Away from smoke and fogs, 
Across the heath you scramble, 
Being mindful of the frogs. 
Oh! Long Branch is the place to ruralize,

Long Branch is the place to ruralize,

party of thirty-eight or more, 
Covered vans and four, case the rain should pour, 
With hampers of nice cold meat a

For a 
dry and peckish day. 
While after us caine tearing, 
Perambulators small, 
Containing babes to share in 
Our pleasures by a 
squall. 
Oh! Long Branch, etc. 
At the " Load of Hay " we stop'd to bait a 
bit; 
Snack to take a 
bit, thirst to slake a 
bit; 
But horse and vans for us wouldn't wait a 
bit, 
Back down hill made way. 
Perambulators smashing, 
Lucky the babies, not a 
few, 
Were removed before the crashing, 
To have their little drops too.

Long Branch, etc. 
At length the hill we mounted, the crest of it, 
Walking the rest of it—that's not the best of it; 
Many who hadn't come out all dressed for it, 
Had to carry a 
little baby, 
The donkeys next we tried them, 
But scarce such animal stirs; 
Then those who flied to ride them, 
Were kicked off among the furze. 
Oh! Long Branch, etc. 
In the " Vale of Health" we soon were mustering, 
Round the table flustering, some began blustering; 
To find tadpoles in our teacups clustering, 
Some had down our throats made way. 
The teapot to put fresh tea in, 
Finding tea-leaves such a 
load, 
Ye gods! what did we see in 
The dregs but a 
monster toad. 
Oh! Long Branch, etc. 
From the table I 
was soon slipping it, 
From toad-tea sipping it, o'er the hills tripping it, 
Something more to my humor was hitting it, 
'Twas a 
sweetheart young and gay. 
For the party no more caring, 
We homeward then did steer, 
How the others they were faring, 
We didn't stay to hear. 
Oh! Long Branch, etc, 
Should any here now wish to ruralize, 
Ritituralize, extramuralize, 
Think how tadpoles in teacups pluralize, 
Upon a 
summer's day. 
Beware of donkeys kicking, 
Or babies on your knees ! 
Or toads in teapots sitting, 
Come to grief in cold tea-leaves. 
?

SONG OP ALL SONGS. 
New Edition, written by FEED SHAW, sung by Miss JENNIE ENGEL. 
As you walk through the streets, you will see as you go, 
In music store windows lots of ballads in a 
row. 
I 
saw some the other day as I 
went along, 
So I've put them together to make up my song. 
There was sweet Annie Lisle and Billy Barlow, 
Going to Limerick, where kissing's all the go. 
Give us back our old Commander, with the Sword of 
Bunker Hill, 
Kissing goes by favor with the lass of Pattie's Mill. 
When this cruel war is over, no niggers need apply, 
For sour krout and sausages is our battle cry. 
We're marching along to answer freedom's call, 
Or jump Jim Crow at Lannigan's ball. 
Then rock me to sleep in my gum- tree canoe, 
The Captlin with his whisker., and his Hoop de dooden 
do. 
John Bull, do you remember the grave of Lillie Dale ? 
St. Patrick was a 
gentleman, a-riding on a 
rail.• 
There's whiskey in the jar, on the banks of Allenwater; 
The brave Sixth Corps after Scroggius's daughter. 
Where's the Spondulix? 
I'm a 
bachelor forlorn, 
In the days when I 
was hard up, where's all the money 
gone ? 
How are you, Greenbacks, in the home of the free. 
With old Robert Ridley in the cottage by the sea. 
I'm a 
single young man; what are the girls about ? 
How are you, Horace Greeley; does your mother know 
you're out ? 
At the battle of Bull Run, where our soldiers brave did 
Give me a 
gallant bark with Sally in our alley; 
Let me kiss him for his mother; he's a 
bold privateer; 
We'll cross the deep blue sea in bully lager beer.

KATIALZEN MAVOURNEEN. 
I'm going to fight mit Sigel, away down in Maine; 
I'm going to be married with my Mary Blanc. 
But there's Wendell Phillips, way down in Dixie land, 
A-courting in the kitchen a 
female contraband. 
I'd like to be a 
soldier, my country's battles fight, 
A-courting Mary Jane, or a-siiarliing Sunday night. 
Indeed I 
am so bashful my love for you must excuse, 
If a 
young gal should propose, I 
don't think I'd refuse. 
Where's all the liquor, our bacon and greens, 
Our starry flag shall wave from Maine to New Orleans. 
But there's noble Washington, his name you can't 
erase, 
.For he was the right man in the right place. 
KATHLEEN MAVOURNEEN, 
As sung by M ISS JENNIE ENGEL. 
KATHLEEN MAVOURNEEN! the grey dawn is breaking, 
The horn of the hunter is heard on the hill, 
The lark from her light wing the bright dew is shaking, 
Kathleen Mavourneen! what slumbering still? 
! 
hast thou forgotten how soon we must sever ? 
Oh! hast thou forgotten this day we must part? 
It may be for years, and it may be forever, 
Oh! why art thou silent, thou voice of my heart ? 
It may be for years, and it may be forever, 
Then why art thou silent, Kathleen Mavourn.een ? 
Kathleen Mavourneen, awake from thy slumbers, 
The blue mountains glow in the sun's golden light; 
Ah! where is the spell that once hung on my numbers, 
Arise in thy beauty, thou star of my night, 
Arise in thy beauty, thou star of my night. 
Mavourneen, Mavourneen, my sad tears are falling, 
To think that from Erin and thee I 
must part; 
BARNEY O'llEA.

It may be for years, and it may be forever,

DERMOT ASTORE. 
As sung by M KS JENNIE ENGEL. 
On! Dermot Astore ! between waking and sleeping, 
I 
heard thy dear voice, and I 
wept to its lay; 
Every pulse of my heart, the sweet measure was keeping, 
Till Killarney's wild echoes had borne it away. 
Oh ! tell me my own love, is this our last meeting, 
Shall we wander no more in Killarney's green bow'rs, 
ro watch the bright sun o'er the dim hills retreating, 
And the wild stag at rest in his bed of- spring flow'rs ? 
Oh! Dermot Astore! between waking and sleeping 
I 
heard thy dear voice, and I 
wept to its lay; 
Ey'ry pulse of my heart the sweet measure was keeping, 
Till Killarney's wild echoes had borne it away. 
Oh ! Dermot Astore! how this fond heart would flutter 
When I 
met thee by night in the shady boreen, 
And heard thine own voice in a 
soft whisper utter 
Those words of endearment, " Mayourneen Colleen," 
I 
know we most part, but 0 ! say not forever, 
That it may be for years, adds enough to my pain ; 
But I'll cling to the hopo that though we must sever, 
In some blessed hour I 
shall meet thee again. 
THE LOVING POSTMAN I 
Or, his Heart went Pit-a-pat. 
As sung by Miss JENNIE ENGEL. 
I TELL Of a 
lass named Mary Day, 
A 
servant up in Broadway, 
Who loved a 
postman I've beard say, 
Who brought the letters to the door. 
How speedily upstairs she strode, 
When she saw him coming down the road, 
Her countenance such joy it showed 
When she answered him at the door. 
Chorus. 
His heart always went pit-a-pat, 
And hers, too, at his loud rat-tat, 
His heart went always pit-a- pat, 
Whenever he knocked at the door. 
Job ,Jenkins was the postman's name, 
With Mary he in love became, 
To win her was his little game, 
Each day he loved her more. 
Though he called forty times a 
day, 
He couldn't muster pluck to say 
"I love you dearly, Mary Day ;" 
He only pressed her hand at the door. 
His heart always, etc. 
Now, Job was anything but a 
fool, 
And said when he thought of it cool, 
" 
Why I 
should not write there's no 'rule 
At once to .Mary Day, 
And say I 
pining am away." 
So he did, and posted the note straightway. 
And delivered it himself that day 
With other letters to Miss Day. 
His heart always, etc. 
And when that letter Mary read, 
If she stood on her heels or head 
She hardly knew, but upstairs sped, 
And read it times a 
score. 
She almost fainted right away, 
For the postman he went on to say, 
He hoped she'd speak the following day, 
When he came with letters to the door. 
His heart always, etc. 
The very next day when he called there, 
He saw he had no cause to despair, 
And said, " I 
love you true, my 
fair, 
And shall always you adore." 
Then answered blushing Mary Day, 
"I've only got this much to say, 
I 
love you, and will name the day 
Next time you come to our door." 
His heart always, etc, 
And so they settled it then and there, 
They constancy to each did swear, 
She smoothed her crinoline and back hair, 
When he went from the door. 
And they were wedded, I've heard so, 
Though that may be some years ago, 
Still he causes her no grief or woe, 
They both cach other do adore. 
His heart always, etc. 
THE COLLEEN BAWN, 
As sung by Miss JENNIE ENiiEL. 
OCH ! 
Patrick darlin', would you lave me 
To sail across the big salt st.a ? 
I 
never thought you'd thus decave me; 
It's not the truth you're tellin' me ! 
TEDDY O'NELLE. 
Though Dublin is a 
mighty city, 
It's there I 
should be quite forlorn, 
For, poor and friendless, who would pity— 
Left lonely there—your Colleen Bawn? 
You tell me that your friends are leaving 
The dear green Isle, to cross the main. 
But don't you think they'll soon be grieving 
For dear ould. Ireland once again ? 
Can they forget each far-famed river ? 
• 
Each hill a 
thousand songs adorn? 
Can you depart from them forever— 
Could you forget your Colleen Bawn? 
Sure, Patrick, me you've been beguiling, 
It's not my heart you mane to break-, 
Though fortune may not now be smiling, 
Your Colleen Bawn you'll not forsake ; 
I'll go with you across the sea, dear, 
If' brighter days for us won't dawn; 
No matter where our home mAy be, dear, 
I 
still will be your Colleen Bawn. 
TEDDY O'NEALE. 
As sung by MIliS JENNIE ENGEL. 
I'VE come to the cabin he danced his wild jigs in, 
As neat a 
mud palace as ever was seen; 
And, consid'ring it served to keep pultry and pigs in, 
I'm sure it was always most elegant clean. 
But now all about it seems lonely and dreary, 
All sad, and all silent, no piper, no reel; 
Not even the sun, through the casement, is cheery, 
Since I 
miss the dear, darling boy, Teddy O'Neale, 
Since I 
miss the dear, darling boy, Teddy O'Neale. 
I 
dreamt but last night, Oh! bad luck to my dreaming, 
I'd die if I 
thought 'twould come truly to pass, 
44 
AUI.D ROBIN GRAY. 
But I 
dreamt, while the tears down my pillow were 
streaming, 
That Teddy was courting another fair lass ; 
0 ! didn't I 
wake with weeping and wailing, 
The grief of that thought was too deep to conceal ; 
My mother cried, " Norah, child, what is your ailing?" 
And all I 
could utter was " Teddy O'Neale," 
And all I 
could utter was " Teddy O'Neale," 
Shall I 
ever forget when the big ship was ready, 
And the moment must come when my love must de-
Tart; 
flow I 
sobbed like a spalpeen, " Good-bye to you 
Teddy,!' 
With drops on my cheek, and a 
stone at my heart, 
He says 'tic to better his fortune he's roving; 
But what would be gold to the joy I 
should feel, 
If I 
saw him come back to me honest and loving, 
Still poor, but my own darling Teddy O'Neale, 
Still poor, but my own darling Teddy O'Neale. 
AULD ROBIN GRAY. 
As sung by Miss JENNIE ENGEL. 
W HEN the sheep are in the fauld, and the kye at hame, 
And a' the wand to sleeP are gane; 
The waes o' my heart fa' in show'rs frae my e'e, 
When my gudeman lies sound by me. 
Young Jamie 10'ed me wee!, and sought me for his 
bride; 
But saving a 
crown, he had naething else beside. 
'Co make that crown a 
pound, my Jamie gaed to sea, 
And the crown and the pound were baith for me. 
He had na, been gone a 
week but only twa, 
When my father brake his arm, and our cow was stowu 
awa'; 
My mither she fell sick, and Jamie at the sea, 
And auld Robin Gray came a-courting me. 
My father couldna, work, and my mither col-
11(111a spin; 
I 
toiled day and night, but their bread I 
couldna win. 
Auld Rob maintained them baith, and wi' tears in 
his e'e, 
Said, " Jeanie, for their sakes, 0 
marry me." 
My heart it said nay—I 
looked for Jamie back; 
But the wind it blew high, and the ship it was a 
wrack. 
The ship it was a 
wrack, why didna, Jeanie dee ? 
And why do I 
live to say, wae's me. 
My father urged me sair, my mither cliclua speak, 
But she looked in my face till my heart was like to 
break. 
So they gi'ed him my hand, though my heart was at the 
sea, 
And Auld Robin gray is gudeman to me. 
I 
hadna been a 
wife a 
week but only four, 
When sitting sae mournfully ae night, at the door, 
I 
saw my Jamie's wraith, for I 
couldna think it he, 
Till he said, I'm come back for to marry thee! 
0 
sair did we greet, and meikle did we say, 
We took but no kiss, and we tore ourselves away; 
I 
wish I 
were dead, but I'm no like to dee; 
Oh! why do I 
live to say, wae's me? 
I 
gang like a 
ghaist and I 
carena to spin, 
I 
darena think o' Jamie, for that wad be a 
sin; 
But I'll do my best a 
glide wife to be, 
For Auld Robin Gray is a 
kind man to me.

He wanted a 
wife, his braw house to keep; 
But favor wi' wooin' was fashous to seek. 
Doun by the dyke-side a 
lady did dwell, 
At his table-head he thought she'd look well 
M'Cleish's ae daughter o' Claverse-ha' Lee, 
A 
penniless lass wi' a 
mug pedigree. . 
His wig was weel pouther'd, an' as gude as new, 
His waistcoat was white, his coat it was blue; 
He put on a 
ring, a 
sword, an' coded hat, 
An' wha could refuse the auld Laird wi' a' that ? 
He took the gray mare, an' rade cannilie, 
An' rapp'd at the yett o' Claverse-ha' Lee; 
" 
Gae tell mistress Jean to come speedily ben, 
She's wanted to speak wi' the Laird o' Cockpen." 
Mistress Jean she was makin' the elder-flower wine; 
" 
An' what brings the Laird at sic a 
like time ?" 
She put off her apron, an' on her silk goun, 
Her mutch wi' red ribbons, an' gaed awn' doun. 
An' when she cam' ben, he bowed fu' low; 
Au' what was his errand, he soon let her know, 
Amazed with the Laird when the Lady said, " Na !" 
Au' wi' a 
laigh curtsie, she turned awn'. 
Dumbfoundered was he, but nae sigh did he gi'e; 
He mounted his mare, and he rade cannilie; 
An' aften he thought, as he gaed through the glen, 
She's daft to refuse the Laird o' Cockpen. 
An' now that the Laird his exit had made, 
Mistress Jean she reflected on what she had said; 
"Oh! for ane I'll get better, it's waur I'll get ten— 
I 
was daft to refuse the Laird o' Cockpen!"

Neist time that the Laird and the Lady were seen, 
They were gaun arm an' arm to the kirk on the green; 
Now she sits in the ha' like a

But as yet there's nae chickens appear'd at Cockpen.

PERHAPS you don't know there's a

Far down in a

A

And och, such a 
jewel is shining inside,— 
I 
don't mean a 
jewel that money can buy,— 
But a 
warm-hearted creature, with love in her eye; 
You'll not find a

Her name is O'Brien. they christened her Kate; 
There's many a

But never a

So lovely, so trim, as my bright-eyed Colleen; 
Her face is a 
picture for limners to paint; 
Her figure might serve for a 
heart-winning saint; 
0, you'll not find a 
beauty so beauteous as she, 
From Ballinacrasy to Donaghadee. 
Her hair, it is smooth as the raven's own back, 
But the bonniest bird has not tresses so black; 
And they curl round a 
neck that might rival the snow, 
With the grace of the swan on the waters below. 
Her mouth— oh, what music I've heard from that samel 
Her breath, it might put the sweet roses to shame. 
Oh! you'll not find a

From Coleraine to Killarney's waters, 
Each lovely .haunt bath had its song, 
Of gallant sons and charming daughters! 
But 0 ! there is one sunny spot, 
To me more dear, more prized than any, 
Where first in loveliness sprung up . 
The rose that blossoms in Killarney, 
The rose that blossoms in Killarney,

My peace, my heart, were 6o

I 
did not dare to sp eak 
of 
love, 
For fear a 
breath the charm should sever; 
Her cheeks are like the rose of May, 
Her voice lath banished care from many, 
No thought can wrong my bonny flower, 
The rose that blossoms in Killarney, 
The rose that blossoms in Killarney, 
Blossoms in Killarney, 
The rose that blossoms in Killarney, 
Blossoms in Killarney.

Oh! steer my bark to Erin's Isle, 
For Erin is my home, 
Oh! steer my bark to Erin's Isle,

I 
MUST GO OUT ON SUNDAYS, 
As sung by M ISS JENNIE ENGEL. 
AIR—" Ilokee Pokes." 
I'm Jenny Jenks, the kitchen maid, 
Of hard work not at all afraid, 
Nor yet partic'lar to a 
shade, 
But I 
must go out on Sundays. 
Six days I'll work with all my might, 
To keep the pots and kettles bright, 
And put the cobwebs out of sight— 
But I 
must go out on Sundays! 
When first I 
went to take a 
place, 
The lady looked me in the face, 
And said, " Young girl, now state your case, 
And what about your Sundays?" 
" 
Mann, I 
can bake, and I 
can brew, 
And I 
can cook an Irish stew, 
And wash a 
shirt, and iron it too, 
But I 
must go out on Sundays!" 
"Indeed! why then ' tis plain," said she, 
"That you will never do for me !" 
I MUST GO OUT ON SUNDAYS. 
I took my leave with a 
curtsey, 
Resolved to have my Sundays. 
A 
dozen places more I 
tried, 
Throughout great New York City wide, 
But everywhere the ladies cried, 
" 
We don't give 
outs' on Sundays !" 
At last to bring the fates to book, 
Sly counsel with myself I 
took, 
And got a 
place with Doctor Hook, 
Who never mentioned Sunday. 
But when came round of days the best, 
In pink and green myself I 
dressed, 
And sailed off gaily to the West, 
Like other girls on Sundays! 
My bean he did me much amuse,. 
So handsome—six foot in his shoes— 
I 
spent the day, did what I 
chose, 
And planned for future Sundays. 
But fancy ! when I 
homeward sped, 
The family was all in bed, 
Save one, who through the keyhole said, 
"That's going out on Sundays !" 
Now, wasn't this a 
pretty plight ? 
No friends at hand, locked out all night, 
And told it only served me right, 
For going out on Sundays! 
But worse, because I 
kicked the door, 
"Police" was called, there came up four, 
Who took me to—I'll say no more, 
But it wasn't a 
place for Sundays. 
So here I 
am again, you see, 
A 
girl of famous industry, 
But one who loves her liberty, 
And most of all on Sundays! 
BONNIE DUNDEE. 
Who wants a 
servant ? 
Sir, do you? 
I'll cook, clean, bake, wait, scrub and brew; 
Darn, stitch, wash, starch and iron, too— 
But I 
must go out on Sundays! 
One word before you answer, pray— , 
This much about myself I'll say 
To reconcile you to my way 
Of going out on Sundays: 
I'll not waste aught that's worth a 
pin, 
Nor ever let a 
policeman in,

As

To the Lords of Convention ' twas Claverhouse spoke, 
'Ere the King's crown go down there are heads to be 
broke; 
Then each Cavalier who loves honor and me, 
Let him follow the bonnets of bonnie Dundee. 
Come fill up my cup, come fill up my can, 
Come saddle my horses, and call out my men; 
Unhook the west port, and let us go free, 
For its up with the bonnets of bonnie Dundee. 
Dundee he is mounted, he rides up the street, 
The bells they ring backward, the drums they are beat; 
But the Provost ( deuce man) said. " Just e'en let it be, 
For the toun is weel rid o' that

There are hills beyond Portland, and lands beyond 
Forth,

Ye ha'e nae seen the last o' my bonnets and me.

As 
sung by Miss JENNIE ENGEL. 
'Twas within a 
mile of Edinburgh town, 
In the rosy time of the year; 
Sweet flowers bloom'd, and the grass was down, 
And each shepherd woo'd his dear. 
Bonnie Jockie blythe and gay, 
Kissed young Jenny making hay; 
The lassie blushed, and frowning cried, " Na, na, it 
winna do; 
I 
canna, canna, winna, winna, maunna buckle to." 
Young Jockie was a 
wag that never wad wed, 
Though lang he had followed the lass; 
Contented she earn'd and eat her brown bread. 
And merrily turned up the grass. 
Bonnie Jockie, blythe and free, 
Won her heart right merrily: 
Yet still she blushed, and frowning cried, " Na, na, it 
winna. do; 
I 
canna, canna, winna, winna, maunna buckle to." 
But when he Toyed he wad make her his bride, 
Though his flocks and herds were not few,

She gi'ed him her hand and a

And vow'd she'd forever be true.

But Katie was the fairest flow'r

In you green field beside the shaw; 
I'll mak' you lady o' them a', 
The brawest wife in Gowrie."

That to swear by I'm loath 
To the heart of a

But be poison my drink, 
If I

Once forgetting to think 
Of your lying alone. 
Oak ! it's how I'm in love, 
Like a 
beautiful dove 
That sits cooing above 
On the bough of a

For myself I'll soon smother, 
In something or other, 
Unless I 
can bother 
Your heart to love me, 
Sweet Molly, sweet Molly Malone, 
Sweet Molly, sweet Molly Malone. 
I 
can see if you smile, 
Though I'm off half a 
mile 
For my eyes all, the while, 
Keep along with my head ; 
And my head you must know, 
When from Molly I 
go, 
Takes its leave with a 
bow, 
And remains in my stead. 
Och ! its how, etc. 
Like a

could sing, 
In the month of the spring, 
But it's now no such thing; 
I'm quite bothered and dead.

And asleep in yonr bed.

As 
sung by Miss JENNIE ENGEL. 
DEAR Erin. how sweetly thy green bosom rises, 
An emerald set in the ring of the sea; 
Each blade of thy meadows my faithful heart prizes, 
Thou queen of the west, the world's Cushlamachree. 
Thy gates open wide to the poor and the stranger; 
There smiles hospitality, hearty and free; 
Thy friendship is seen in the moment of danger, 
And the wand'rer is welcom'd with " Cushlamachree." 
Thy sons they are brave, but the battle once over, 
In brotherly peace with their foes they agreo; 
And the roseate cheeks of thy daughters discover 
The soul-speaking blush, that says, " Cushlama-
chree." 
Then flourish forever, my dear native Erin, 
While sadly I 
wander, an exile from thee! 
And firm as thy- mountains, no injury fearing, 
Hay heaven defend its own Cushlamachree. 
DEAR 114RP OF MY COUTRY, 
As sung by MISS JENNIE ENGEL. 
DEAR Harp of my country! in darkness I 
found thee, 
The cold chain of silence had hung o'er thee long, 
When proudly, my own Island Harp, I 
unbound thee, 
And gave all thy chords to light, freedom and song! 
The warm lay of love and the light note of gladness, 
Have walzen'd thy fondest, thy liveliest thrill, 
But so oft hast thou echo'd the deep sigh of sadness, 
That even in thy mirth it will steal from thee still. 
Dear harp of my country! farewell to thy numbers, 
This sweet wreath of song is the last we shall twine; 
UL ERIN. 
61 
Go, sleep with the sunshine of fame on thy slum1)3r, 
Till touched by some hand less unworthy than mine. 
If the pulse of the patriot, soldier or lover, 
Have throbb'd at our lay, ' tis thy glory alone; 
I 
was but as the wind, passing heedlessly over, 
And all the wild sweetness I 
waked was thine own 
BEAUTIFUL ERIN, 
As sung by Miss JENNIE EXCEL. 
BEAUTIFUL Erin! I 
leave thy shore, 
For a 
home far over the sea; 
But where Niagara's waters roar, 
This heart still will beat for thee. 
In fancy I'll roam the mountain side, 
Where the homes of my fathers stand; 
And I'll sing amid the dark woods wide, 
The songs of my own green land, 
I'll sing, I'll sing the songs of my own green land, 
I'll sing, I'll sing the songs of my own green land. 
Breaking the bough with weary toil, 
In that land where plenty flows, 
I'll sigh for my own dear verdant soil, 
Where my native shamrock grows. 
Oh! beautiful Erin, then fare-thee-well, 
Dear home of my childhood's hours! 
No more 'mid thy fond bright scenes I 
dwell, 
Farewell to thy fields and flowers, 
Farewell! farewell! farewell to thy fields and flow-rs 
Farewell! loved Erin, oh fare- thee-well.

That's found near the banks of Killarney, 
Believe it from me, 
No girl's heart is free, 
Once she hears the sweet sound of the " Blarney," 
The blarney's so great a 
deceiver, 
That a 
girl thinks you there though you leave her, 
And never finds out 
All•the tricks you're about, 
Till she's quite gone, herself, with your blarney. 
Oh ! say, would you find this same blarney? 
There's a 
castle not far from Killarney, 
On the top of its wall, 
(But take care you don't fall,) 
There's a 
stone that contains all this blarney; 
Like a 
magnet its influence such is, 
That attraction it gives all it touches, 
If you kiss it, they say, 
That froruthat blessed day,

You may kiss whom you please with your blarney.

That such a 
misfortune should give her such pain, 
A 
kiss then I 
gave her, and before I 
did leave her, 
She vow'd for such pleasure she'd break it again. 
'Twas hay-making season, I 
can't tell the reason, 
Misfortunes will never come single, 'tis plain, 
For very soon after poor Kitty's disaster,

For then, through your groves, by your waters I

While calm as the moonlight that siiver'd your charms,

leave me, and to-morrow, 
Dark shadows may pass away. 
There's a 
time when all that grieves us 
Is felt with a 
deeper gloom; 
There's a

And we dream of bright days to come. 
In winter from the mountain, 
The stream like a 
torrent flows, 
In summer the same fountain 
Is calm as a 
child's repose. 
Thus in grief the first pang wounds us, 
And tears of despair gush on, 
Time brings forth new flowers around us, 
And the tide of our grief is gone. 
Then heed not my pensive hours, 
Nor bid me be cheerful now; 
Can sunshine raise the flowers 
That droop on a 
blighted bough ? 
The lake in the tempest wears not 
The brightness its slumbers wore, 
The heart of the mourner cares not 
For joys that were dear before.

They've left their bonnie highland hills, 
Their wives and bairnies dear, 
To draw their sword for Scotland's lord, 
And the young Chevalier. 
01 Charlie, etc. 
0! there were mony beating hearts, 
And mony hopes and fears, 
And mony were the pray'rs put up' 
For the young Chevalier.

And down you craggy glen, 
We dare nae gae a

For Charlie and his men,
