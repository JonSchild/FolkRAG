Paul Vance interviewed by Jaime Lopez, Barrie Cline, and Seta re Arashloo 
My name is Paul Vance, and I am currently an MU. I'm rounding the last bit of that. I 
have my A test Saturday, and then six weeks after that, I think, I should get a card or 
something like that. I don't know actually, because it's kind of intense. [00:00:30] I'm 
feeling very all sorts of things about it. Yeah, and I've been doing this for, I guess, five 
some odd years, five and a little bit of change. 
Great. What kind of work are you doing now? 
The work that I'm doing now, for the majority of my apprenticeship I have been doing a 
lot of, in the city [00:01:00] right now, there's just a lot of renovation work, like office 
renovation work, adding offices, ta king away offices, changing offices into conference 
rooms, changing offices into Iittler offices. Lots of offices right now, so renovation work 
mostly. 
Where isthat jobthatyou are now? 
This one that I've been at [00:01:30] is 42nd between 3rd and Lex, a law firm. I forget 
what the name of the law firm is, but yeah. This particular building, they've been 
working on for the past two or three yea rs with this specific company. 
Can you tell us a little bit about how you became an electrician? 
How I became an electrician? It was kind of like [00:02:00] a shotgun. Right after high 
school, I was supposed to actually send in my application, but I forgot to pay something. 
There was like a fee that I neglected to write a check for or something like that, and that 
got squashed. Then it came up right after I finished college. [00:02:30] When did I finish 
college? Oh, God. I'm not going to try this calculate right now because that would be 
boring. I finished college and my mom was like, "They're doing a roll call for who wants 
to be in the local again, local three, and do you want me to fill out the forms and stuff?" 
I was just like, "Kind of no," because I didn't want to go through another [00:03:00] four 
or five year experience, but I was like, whatever, so I sent out the form. 
Then I started working at a film and photo studio, slash art studio with my sculpting 
teacher. It was for, like, two years. Then I was hitting a ceiling there and I didn't know 
what to do, and they sent me a letter back [00:03:30] that I would be able to get an 
interview or something like that. Take a test, get an interview, yada yada yada. I kind of 
just went through the motions and it just happened, I feel like. It doesn't seem like it just 
happened now that I look back at it. I guess I was gearing myself towards it eventually, 
[00:04:00] but it kind of felt like it just happened. I'm just going to pretend it just 
happened.

Paul Vance: 
How did you know about the profession? Did you have a family ... 
Prior? I didn't. I now have a family member in it, my sister married an electrician who 
was my mom's best friend's son. I only kind of heard ... My mom was like, "Oh, you 
should be an electrician, [inaudible 00:04:31] [00:04:30] . Look at Matt, he's traveling all 
over the place and he's living in the city. Don't you want to live in the city?" She was 
kind of tempting me into this profession that I had no desire that I wanted to be in, with 
total surface level superficial things. I'm like, "Yeah, I'm [inaudible 00:04:54] just 
because Matt became an electrician. [00:05:00] That's exactly how my life's going to 
be." Yeah, so I only knew that I could travel, but not really, and what else? She was like, 
"He's set, so you should think about doingthis." 
Awesome. Do you remember your first day on the job? 
Do I remember my first day on the job? 
Or your first [00:05:30] job? 
Yeah. I was actually thinking about all the jobs that I've been on. Because I've only been 
in it for five and a half years, I can kind of pace myself and actually remember every 
damn job I've been on. Well, the first day, I feel like, going through the apprenticeship is 
that damn 10-hour OSHA class where they [00:06:00] just sit you down and tell you 
terrible things. Not terrible things, but just prepare you for what's to come. I just 
remember sitting in that class and just being like, "Oh my God, what have I gotten 
myself into?" Yeah, they'd tell you the first day, "Just think of yourself as the lowest of 
the low. Don't expect to know anything. You're just whale [00:06:30] poop right now. 
Just think of yourself at the bottom of the sea." This entire apprenticeship I've been just 
floating up to the surface, but yeah. 
First day, I got sent to the Javits Center, which was kind of horrifying, I feel like, for the 
first day. It's such a huge spot. There's cherry pickers and things you have [00:07:00] to 
drive and stuff. Not coming from any experience in construction, I was just like, "Wow, 
what the hell did I get myself into?" Apparently, the guy that I was going to see was kind 
of like a tool bag. The foreman, he was just not a friendly guy you want to be meeting on 
your first day. [00:07:30] Yeah, that was just a hiccup.They had nowhere else to put me 
so I ended up there for day one, and then the next day, I was sent to another job where 
I met actually, he turned out to be a really great foreman and person to work for. I never 
watched "Sopranos", but [00:08:00] the guy that I met the first day might as well have 
been cut out of a scene from "The Sopranos". His name was like Tony, it was so 
stereotypical. He was sitting in front of this big wooden desk, he might as well have 
been smoking a cigar. He wasn't, but he should've. Yeah. He was really sweet, but he 
was kind of like this dry sense of humor. I didn't know if he was making fun of me half 
the day or whatever, but [00:08:30] as an apprentice, you're constantly called a kid. 
That's the role that you kind of play, like, "Oh, I don't know. What's this? What's that?"

How did you learn? How did you know what to do? 
Paul Vance: 
Jaime: 
Paul Vance: 
Jaime: 
Paul Vance: 
Barrie: 
Paul Vance: 
It was kind of like, you get your journeyman that you work under the first day. I knew 
nothing. I just knew that I had to ask questions and just do things, because that's 
[00:09:00] how I, in life, learn things. I just have to do it. I never pretended I knew what I 
was doing. I feel like that's super important. Never assume that you know something 
that you can't. There's some things that are just common sense, but [00:09:30] you're 
not going to know how to bend a pipe without having bent a pipe before. You're not 
going to know how to touch a wire. You do it, I guess, changing fixtures and stuff, but 
you're not quite sure what you're doing. I just followed my journeyman and asked a 
million stupid questions that I didn'tthink were stupid, but they probably were, just 
[00:10:00] kept doing stuff. You work overtime so you could see things that you 
wouldn't normally see on a normal work week and stuff like that. Some things aren't 
done, then you just pace yourself, little baby steps. 
When you work overtime, where would you go? Were there any special projects that 
caught [00:10:30] your eye? 
I worked mostly in renovations. My favorite job was probably when I did do a deck for a 
quick stint. Well, it felt like a quick stint. It probably is not a quick stint in some people's 
eyes, but from the winter to the end of the summer I did a deck job, and that was 
beautiful. I actually felt like- 
Can you describe it? 
A construction worker. [00:11:00] Can I describe the ... 
What the work is actually? 
What I was doing was basically ... That was a crazy job because I was stuck with this guy 
who I did not respect whatsoever, but I was stuck with him and I don't think anyone 
respected him at this job site. It was really frustrating. I got paired with him because I 
can work with anyone, [00:11:30] and they just stuck me with this guy. There were a lot 
of awesome journeymen that came through to help us out throughout the process, but I 
was doing the data portion, the infrastructure, the data part of this building. It was a 
Parson's new school, new dormitory slash teaching school for the grad program 
[00:12:00] I think. 
We basically watched the building just grow out of the ground from the third floor up to 
... It wasn't that tall of a building, but it was really cool. It was right when the World 
Trade Center was popping up. It was not the World Trade Center, but we had that 
pipeline view right down the street. It was pretty unique. You wake [00:12:30] up, you 
see the exoskeleton of a building, you're going to be working on top of it, and you got 
the craziest views, and pretty awesome sunsets and stuff. The type of work, it was a 
bitch. It was a lot of heavy work, you're hoisting stuff up really narrow staircases, super 
dangerous. It was intense. That was still my first year. [00:13:00] When they told me, 
they were like, "Dress warm, kid, for your next job." I was like, "God dammit, I'm not

ready for the outdoors yet." I was not ready for that, but I was. You just kind of have to. 
The guy that they stuck me with was super dependent on me, which was hilarious 
because I'm a first year apprentice. I don't even know if I was initiated yet. I might've 
been. Six months, right, it takes? 
Something like that, right? 
Yeah. [00:13:30] I think I might've just gotten initiated, and I was basically laying out a 
new building in New York with six months of experience. It was kind of crazy, and yeah, I 
learned really fast that part of it, which is such a tiny little piece of the puzzle. There's so 
many other things that I feel like [00:14:00] you can do and stuff like that. 
How did you start connecting with him? Generally when you go to a job site ... 
Connect with who? 
With the foreman you were working with on that job. Or generally, like your coworkers, 
how is your relationship with them? I know it's different. 
It definitely, every job is super different. It's kind of amazing, the [00:14:30] colorful 
personalities you meet on these jobs. For me, in general in life, I'm always a better 
listener than lama talker. That gets you really far, I feel like. Just shut your mouth, 
listen, see what you can pick up, and just [00:15:00] go. For him, that very unique 
experience with that guy, you're just stuck with these people for a really long time, so 
little bits and pieces just start to crumble. I was doing a lot of overtime with him so I was 
literally stuck with this guy for way too much time. 
I had just [00:15:30] weird conversations. He ended up being this person who loved 
painting landscapes and stuff like that, and I was like, "Oh, I just graduated Pratt," and 
you just find these weird little ... Then sometimes, like for this pe rson in particular, there 
was a little bit too much information we were sharing together, and I was just like, "This 
is making me uncomfortable." Yeah, you just peel these people [00:16:00] apart like a 
fruit, right down into the seeds. He was hard because no one really liked this guy. It was 
really funny. This guy, no one really respected, so I guess because I was his underling, he 
felt like he could lean on me for whatever. It was weird. 
[00:16:30] Have you found other people on other jobs that were that type of person? 
Did that repeat again, like, people that were un-liked and that would [crosstalk 
00:16:38]? 
I mean, this guy was just a really unique, because I think he was family. Yeah, not 
everyone gets along. You're with 40 dudes. It's like the craziest environment ever. It's 
nicer, like when I first started, I [00:17:00] was getting more of a mix for some reason. 
There was women, it was a bigger shop, so I guess it was a more diverse crowd. I mean, 
not that it's never diverse. I don't know. Yeah, have I ever met another person that 
wasn't liked? Of course, but this particular person, he was severely disliked. I don't know 
if it was because of [00:17:30] this job in particular. I met amazing people that balance

him out within the people that I meet, but he just sticks out like a sore thumb because I 
was with him for, I think probably one of the longer jobs I've been on, because it's a 
deck job, so it's just like you're literally withthis person way too much. 
Could you tell me about some of these skills you developed throughout the years, or 
special skills that you've learned, orthings [00:18:00] that you didn't think you had 
before and now you're like, "Look at me now"? 
I kind of joined this little thing in hopes that I would learn a million ... Yeah, there's a 
million things I've learned how to do, problem solving being my strongest at this point, I 
think. Just using whatever you have to get a job done. God, pipe [00:18:30] bending, 
layout, what else have I done? You're basically building the infrastructure of a building, 
which feels like you're building a person. Yeah, I don't know ... Do you want my hour 
sheet? I could give you my hour sheet of... 
No, no. [crosstalk 00:18:56] 
[crosstalk 00:18:56] what stands out for you? 
Stands out, [00:19:00] what I learned. Gosh. I could give you the easy answer. I've 
learned how to pipe bend, I learned how to make a light flick on and off. I guess I 
learned that I could work in this industry. 
You could do it, right. 
I never saw myself [00:19:30] working in construction ever, so yeah. I think after this 
whole five year, like, I can do this. There's like a million things I've learned, but that's 
probably the thing that stands out the most after this whole apprenticeship. 
Does any of it feel creative in nature? Any [00:20:00] of the things? 
No. I mean, yes and no. You're given a print, you follow the print, you follow the rules 
for the most part. You get creative on smaller jobs, I guess, because you have to design 
where this pipe is going to go. Someone's not necessarily being like, they're giving you a, 
[00:20:30] "A, B, fill in the middle," kind of situation. 
Right. Some jobs are very detailed. 
Yeah. Some jobs, if you like mess a measurement up, you're getting yelled at because 
someone else's vent or water pipe is supposed to go in there. Have I seen beautiful work 
done that looks like art? Yeah. These guys [00:21:00] are like mathematicians who run 
pipe. That's beautiful and lovely to think how they figure that out, but at this point, it's 
pretty cut and dry. It's not like I'm designing light fixtures or something like that. Little 
things could be creative, like how you figure out how to get an outlet from falling into 
the wall or something. You can get creative [00:21:30] with stuff like that, like 
MacGuyver type stuff, little tools you invent throughout the day to get a job done, but 
I'm not painting the Mona Lisa. I'm given a print and it's like, "Do it." Actually, it's like, 
Paul Vance 111716

"Don't get too creative, kid. Just get it done. Don't think outside the box. Figure 
[00:22:00] it out."

Do you have a favorite tool? 
Do I have a favorite tool? I use my pliers for everything. It's like a hammer, a screw 
trimmer, bang this thing in, twist wires [inaudible 00:22:22] with it. I guess I love my 
little level. [00:22:30] It makes everything look pretty. 
When you say pretty, what do you mean? 
I mean, just, not like an eyesore. Something that goes so unnoticed in life, just straight 
lines. People function well with them, they need them. When things are crooked and 
stuff, it messes everything up. 
[00:23:00] Do you have a story about your tools? 
Do I have a story about my tools? I mean, how I drop them down holes all the time and 
it's lucky that no one gets hurt? No..just kidding. Do I have a specific story? 
Do you have a story? 
I mean, my pliers now have a chip in it because I bit into something live, and it haunts 
me for the rest of my life when I try to splice something. 
What ? Tell the story. 
How did that [00:23:30] happen? How did you [crosstalk 00:23:30]? 
How did that happen? All right, so I was working with this really senile old man, and he 
was like, "Oh, everything's dead." Me, being the gullible apprentice, was like, "Oh, of 
course, everything's dead." Whatever, Seymour said it is. I just caught two phases , and 
it just was like a little explosion in my face, but it was low voltage, so it wasn't anything 
besides [00:24:00] a " oops "That happens. That happens when those two things 
happen." 
[crosstalk 00:24:03] use your pliers as a wire stripper. 
Yes, which is so annoying, because it does not cut things easily ever, at all, anymore. 
The guy told you to go cut the wire. 
No. It was like a demo job. What a shame. It was at the Park Palace Hotel, we were 
renovating all the floors. It was kind of like this job [00:24:30] we were given, go to 
every floor, take out X amount of these lights. You kind of fall into a habit like, "All right, 
floor's dead. Go." I just got a little too comfortable and was like, "All right, everything's 
Paul Vance 111716 
Page 6 of 12 
dead," twisted the two things together, and you're not supposed to put two phases 
together, and it was a little [00:25:00] explosion.

Were you knocked back?[ 00:25:01] 
No. It was low voltage, it was more like a, "Oops," and just check to see. I have been hit 
with high voltage, that's not fun, which is kind of scary that it only took five years for me 
to feel that. 
[inaudible 00:25:19] It got a little scary, what, after you heard the stories about what it 
could do? Or scary just because of what it felt like [crosstalk 00:25:27]? 
No, I mean, what it felt like getting thrown off a ladder. [00:25:30] I mean, I jumped off 
the ladder because it felt like I should. Yeah, it's weird. Electricity's weird. It can do so 
many fun things that you'll never be able to prepare yourself for. It's quite a beast. Yeah, 
so I don't have any fun stories about my tools. I haven't named any of my tools. 
How about a coffee story? 
A coffee [00:26:00] story? 
When you went out for coffee for the guys. Do you have any stories about coffee orders 
with... 
I have an amazing one but I didn't do it. I try to be very good with my coffee. Coffee is 
such a funny, intense, dreaded thing as an apprentice, because you're required to take 
everyone's order. You have to remember it, you have to give them back change, who 
wants exact change, who wants pennies. It can become such a damn mess. There 
[00:26:30] was this one apprentice at my recent shop who ...this guy ordered two 
separate sandwiches. It was like a bacon, egg, and cheese, and a peanut butter and jelly. 
Somehow these two sandwiches combined themselves in the deli, and when this kid 
brought that back, it was just like, "Holy bejesus. All right, something happened, 
[00:27:00] miscommunication, go back and fix this." The kid went, came back, and 
brought back the same exact sandwich twice. It was like, "So this is just your problem 
here. You don't realize these two things don't make sense." 
That's funny, but yeah, coffee can be super intense. You have to space [00:27:30] out 
your timing. It's like this whole formula it becomes, like how you do it, because it's such 
a sensitive time in the day. 
What time is that? When do you usually go? 
Everyone is so sensitive by that time. What time is that? 9 o'clock is like the bewitching 
hour when you're supposed to be back for break [00:28:00] typically. You get so much 
crap if you're back too early, you get so much crap if you're back late, but there's a rush 
of people ordering at this same time, at the deli. Then you have all the people that just 
are getting to work for the day, all accumulating in the deli, and you have, like, three deli

guys. I mean, their job is so intense. I could not imagine being a deli [00:28:30] guy. 
There's just so many orders, and you've got to make sure you got your order, you got all 
the right stuff, and then it's like a really sensitive time. Guys can be very annoying about 
their coffee. I've heard some horror stories, but I've never gotten myself involved in any 
of that. I've dodged all those bullets. 
That's amazing. 
Somehow, I don't know how. I guess I got lucky because I didn't work on crazy jobs, but 
you [00:29:00] hear stories about guys taking orders for an entire building, using a 
wagon that they had to pick up to deliver. 
Insulate them, too. 
Yeah. Literally as an apprentice, a lot of your morning goes into thinking about avoiding 
being the person that has to go for coffee. 
[crosstalk 00:29:22] 
It's like, "I'm so busy, I can't possibly go for coffee. You really have to do it this week. I'm 
sorry. We've got all this work [00:29:30] that I have to do, all this staring that I have to 
accomplish." 
You negotiate with the other apprentices, what days you would go for coffee? Or did 
you ever get out of going for coffee completely? 
I mean, I definitely try to position myself in the person that doesn't have to go for 
coffee. I mean, I would do it. Like, I didn't mind doing it, because I just liked the idea that 
everyone got their coffee and can continue on with their [00:30:00] day. It was so gut 
wrenching to see an apprentice mess up a coffee order. 
Yeah, I agree. It hurts. 
It's so painful to watch. It's like, "Oh God, get over it. It's coffee." Yeah, it's really 
intense. Coffee is a big deal in the construction industry. 
Why? 
I know why I get a little twitchy when I don't have mine. I just get a little like, whatever, 
but it's that morning break. These [00:30:30] guys need it. You do a lot in the morning, 
and it helps pace out your day, I guess. 
When do you usually start in the morning? 
Seven. Most jobs start at seven. I was on a job that the building didn't allow us in at 8 
o'clock. Like, we negotiated 8 o'clock. They wanted to let us in at 9, and that was like, 
Paul Vance 111716 
Page 8 of 12 
"No, it can't possibly. Get me off this job immediately." [00:31:00] It's nice to start at 7. I 
don't like starting at 8.

What do you like about your job, and what would you change about it if you could 
change anything? 
What do I like about my job? I like things. I guess, why I like working in the construction 
industry in [00:31:30] general is that it doesn't feel like a superficial type of job. I feel 
like "making a difference in the world". No. I mean, I feel like I'm actually contributing to 
a bigger piece of the puzzle. I like naturally making things, building. I like putting two 
and [00:32:00] two togetherand it makes four. I like the sensation of finishing 
something and seeing it work. I hate the sensation of finishing something and seeing it 
not work, but I like figuring out why it didn't work. It's problem solving, you get into 
routines but you're quickly jolted [00:32:30] out of them. There's always something, 
some little hiccup that you have to accomplish or get over or hurdle to cross. I mean, 
electricity's cool. I didn't sign up to be a plumber or a mason or something like that, or 
an ironworker. [00:33:00] I feel like there's a lot of things you could do with it, and it's 
cool. 
Paul, I know you're taking your ATest on Saturday, and you went [00:33:15] through 
this whole process. You're going to be in a situation where you're going to be a 
journeyman and possibly have your own apprentice. You have any advice? Have you 
thought about what that's going to feel like, or what kind of things you're going to do 
with your apprentice? 
[00:33:30] I've had an apprentice, being an M worker and working with other guys. You 
just go throughout your day step by step. I wasn't like jotting down notes with my M 
[inaudible 00:33:54]. Whomever I work with, [00:34:00] I go throughout my day, even 
when I work with journeymen and stuff like that. Not when I first start, but now you've 
learned a trick in the past and this is how I might approach this, or how would you 
approach it? "Tell me why," I guess would be my way to approach [00:34:30] whomever 
I work with, or something like that. 
Sometimes you find yourself in a situation where you're tradingtricks. 
You're trading tricks, or yeah, or someone asks you, "Do you see anything that I don't 
see?" Because you're a new set of eyes, so you obviously might see like a cornerthat 
you were in and this could be troublesome. "I wouldn't [00:35:00] go that way." Yeah, I 
can't say I know everything. You'll never know everything, so I'll tell you what I know 
and see if it works out. That's how I would approach that situation. I mean, it's so crazy 
because you're working with people who are your senior in age and [00:35:30] possibly 
experience elsewhere. Just because you're an apprentice doesn't necessarily mean ... 
It's so weird, the apprenticeship in general. 
Kind of don't want to ask you, but I'm going to ask anyway. Do you feel that the 
apprenticeship should change in a certain way?

Everything needs to naturally grow. [00:36:00] There's a reason why it's worked for so 
long, but there's definitely reasons it doesn't work for everybody. I don't know if that's 
intentional. I mean, it is. You're doing a very specific job. They set up guidelines to do 
this very sensitive special job, but we're in [00:36:30] such a place right now where 
technology is exploding. There's new stuff, you can't keep up with any of this stuff. 
Yeah, I definitely think there's better ways to teach people, especially for the most part, 
this is a very specific group of person that takes this on as a job or a career. 
There's [00:37:00] definitely other ways I would approach it. Definitely more hands-on 
because I feel like the theory class, that time is kind of wasted in the books. For the 
most part, I feel like there might be some people that are heady book people, but a lot 
of these guys are not into that type of learning in general. That's why they didn't go to 
college, that's why they jumped into [00:37:30] it, why they're in that ship. I feel like a 
more hands-on type of approach would work with training, because you're not 
necessarily going to be doing that on the job site, like, the things that they expect you to 
know. Like, what's a paper test when on the job site, you're not filling in multiple choice 
Scantron things. You're building a [00:38:00] damn building that has to work for a lot of 
people. It's super important. I don't know. 
Okay. Can you say more about how technology has affected the job for you? 
I mean, hence why we're knocking down offices we built six months ago, because 
there's a new TV or there's a new way to run this wire, or there's a new lighting system 
that [00:38:30] you have to install to keep up with the updates of how these things 
work. There's a million reasons why technology is ... The pace of the job, just because 
you can get things done faster. It's kind of annoying, the pace that a lot of these jobs are 
started and accomplished. Also, [00:39:00] it's changing the pace of the job so much 
that certain formulas that you normally start and finish a job with are getting 
disrupted.People aren't that familiar with a lot of this technology, so there's a lot of 
hiccups and stuff they have to go back and forth with. Plans are constantly changing 
because you can just print out [00:39:30] a new one, or you could just send an email. It's 
just like, "Oh, all right, I guess that update just happened today and you want it finished 
in an hour. Okay, sure." Everything is so rushed and materials are cheaper I guess now, 
so everything wants stuff on the dime. Yeah, technology isn't ruining things, but it's 
[00:40:00] definitely shaken things up a lot in the construction industry. 
I mean, it should shake up things more. New York is so outdated compared to so many 
other places you travel to and see. I mean, freaking take our subway system. What is 
that, still a switchboard? Isn't it something like crazy archaic? It's something 
nauseatingly [00:40:30] old. Yeah. 
Yeah, it's super outdated. It's being renovated constantly, but I don't think [crosstalk 
00:40:39]. 
Not the core of it. Like, Thailand built their brand new sparkling fresh subway system in, 
what, like two years or three years or something like that. We're just spoiled [00:41:00]

here. We're just so set in our ways, which is funny but, yeah, a city that constantly is 
changing. 
Have you ever... think that there is risk involved in your job, including finding a job, 
being at a job site? Anything that make you feel like you have to be careful about how 
you do[00:41:21] your job? 
Do you want me to answer the [00:41:30] broad way you asked it? Yeah, the industry is 
super wavy right now, in terms of employment. Every day at the job site, I could lose an 
eye. It's super dangerous in that sense. Yeah, it's not a comfortable, [00:42:00] cozy, 
cushy job. It's gritty. There's tons of stuff that is risky. There's a lot of things that are 
risky about my job. I mean, most jobs right now, but yeah, risk is part of getting up in 
the morning for everyone, I feel. Yeah, it's definitely [00:42:30] a high percentage of that 
stuff. 
Do you have any [inaudible 00:42:37]? I feel good. I feel like, Paul, you said some 
amazing things. There's really deep, reflective things you said too. 
I'm in a deep reflective space because five and a half years, and then I take this test, and 
I've been reflecting for a while. I don't [00:43:00] know what to do next. 
What are you feeling like? [inaudible 00:43:03] 
I just want to run as far as I can possibly run. I'm feeli ng a whole bunch of things. The 
apprenticeship is, for me, I guess school in general, you just feel like you're caught in a 
little cage. [00:43:30] Then you get an inch of that door that's open and you just want to 
fly the freak out, but that place is so comfortable and safe that it's like, "Where a m I 
going to go?" I don't know. I learned a lot, I'm obviously going to continue doing it, see 
where it takes me. Yeah, I [00:44:00] don't know. 
Do you have anything else for Paul? I think we pushed him to the limits. 
Yeah, right. 
I'm proud of you, man. I'm proud of you and everything you've done. 
Thank you. 
I want to see you continue. 
I'm proud of myself. There's this one dude in a class my first year, he's like, "I don't think 
you're going to make it, man." 
They told [00:44:30] you that [crosstalk 00:44:27]? 
Was he trying to bait you?

No, he definitely wasn't. He's this Caribbean guy, older dude, probably like 40s with two 
kids. I would be doodling in the corner not paying attention, and he's like, "I don't think 
you're going to make it. I don't think this is for you." I was like, "We'll see." I made it. 
[00:45:00] You did. 
What else? Anything? 
I don't have anything else for you, Paul. 
Okay. 
I'm happy you came down and you agreed to it. I'm happy to have you a part of our 
team, too. 
Yeah, it's awesome. 
I have one question. 
Shoot. 
Where do you usually get coffee, and do they have [crosstalk 00:45:22]? 
I don't know if I usually get coffee anywhere. It's normally a coffee cart [00:45:30] if I 
have time in the morning. 
If you have a choice between [crosstalk 00:45:35] ... 
This place is good, Starbucks, I mean, I drink anything. I'm not a coffee snob. 
Thank you. 
Yeah, for sure. 
Thanks for helping us out. 
How many have you done so far?
