and so may go into more background than needed for y
 
understanding.
 This will relate to your exrreased wi'
 
that the Dresent portion (
-) of Father's estate now wi
 
to us 4 children be distributed just as soon rs the tr
 
department of the bank could do so.
 (Y u recall
. that
 
the estate tax must be paid in 15 months after the den
 
i
nd that the valuation of the estate determIning that
 
ust be established x1lax on the date of dhe death, or
 
the valuation on the date one year after the death.
 '
 
the tax on an estate valued at $150,000.00 would a;l m
 
at least to  15,000.00 with an added 20  tax on exec
 
value of an additional  50,000, both Mr. Waggener a
r
t
 
r. MacBean felt we would be wine to wait until one
 
after to determine whether on not that valuation (
late
 
-
rould not mean a substantial saving in tax--in other wor c
'
 
if the market value of
 stocks shou á have gone dc
'
 
v next Jan. 26th, that oonditionoould be taken to our benef t ,
 
However, I stated your views to Mr. MacBean.
 He
 
d thit except in unusual trusts the bank alwayg
r  waits until
 
t least a year before settlement for this reason:
 lega'lv
 
creditor has a full year to establish his claim against
 
the estate4 hut, if the bank had settled the estate before
 
�
 year any creditor could establish a just debt
.t wo l
 
be the responsibility of the bakk to take care of the Cl
 
:
!r. MacBean begs for more time before even estimating just
 
t
hen it would be possible to settle the estate under a
 
if that is what we wish.
 As for r
.e,I am inclined to ws :
:
 
year out.
 
The biggest moot ooint in establishing the value
 
te estate rroin the bank's stand'oint is determtnation c
 
he value of Father's books and oo yrightn.
 Keep this
 
mind when you are making the rounds in New York and mour
 
"ut  i
hat opinions you can about this and for
' ard on to

acBean.
 Any basis we can ferret out to keep such valu
Y :is
 
low would help out much.
 
A rough estimate of Mr. MoBean shows that reguln:r
 
i
ncome from stocks, etc, at present is $6
,000.00 annua'
.
 
This means that Deanie's 1/2 of the estate to be held
 
trust for her would amount to a3,OOO.O0F t
1 for her. 
In addition she is specifically willed aTr, ncome from

Dear John:
 
We have had considerable correspondence with The Machillan
 
Company in regard to ownership of the bookrights in your father's
 
estate,
 
We had assumed that this question had been finally settled,
 
but the publishers have now requested us to have all of the children
 
and Mrs. Lomax join in an agreement supplementing the agreement
 
previously signed, in regard to division of the estate.  We are, there-
fore, enclosing this agreement in sextuplet and if it meets with your
 
approval, we shall appreciate your signing each copy of the agreement
 
and then forwarding all copies to Mrs. Mansell requesting her and her
 
husband to sign and forward to the next in line.
 
We regret that we have to trouble you again with this
 
matter, but the publishers seem to think it is necessary to have
 
this additional agreement.

Dear F
rater e
t sororeas
 
Having forgotten the detailed history of the
 
handling of the eatate,  hen I first read the opposite letter and euppl mental
 
agreement  was inclined not to sign.
 But I dug out and waded thru nr file
 
(now quite bulky) and freshened my memory so as to be satisfied.
 
Codicil 2 to father's will s
tatess
 "all book rights, etc.,
 
shall revert to my children, upon the death of Ruby T. Lomax .
 However, Mr. Mac-
Bean laboriously expl ined to me by letter before I signed the agreement that
 
of the book rights legally belonged to Deanie and that they would have to
 
go to her, in order for our interpretation of his intent (as evidenced by the
 
agreement we £igR E chose--and later signed--to stand).
 Deanie was visiting
 
us when that agreement came to me and fully agreed that i
t was definitely not
 
father's intent for the book rights to pass out of the Lomax family.
 As soon
 
as she returned to Dallas, she xxmta ma of tk±z gazt zxt tk t put the above in
 
writing, stating that should  he die before preparing a will that her letter
 
was to stand for the assignment of her
 interest in the book rights back to the
 
c
hildren.
 I trust the good, kind lady has prepared a will.
 But this is no
 
time to raise a (ueetion.
 
Recently, Mr. MacBean forwarded to me a deed to ftil 8170 
San Benito Way along with abstract of title made in favor of us 4 children.
 
I have placed same in my bank box.
 If any of you wish to examine or to keep,
 
j
ust whistle.
 
We are all chugging along very well.
 The boys both have
 
the same cold brought home from school by Johhny, but we  can't say they are
 
sick or even s
lowed down.
 Both were judged aneamic by the Doc. about Oct let
 
had have been on vitamins since and are so full of energy that they j
ust about
 
wear us out.
 Johnny now weighs 55 and Joey 28.
 Although we have a hugs aand
 
:ile, what with a horde of neighbor children who play in i
t, continually runs
 
dry.
 Periodically, about every 3 months, then, we go an a sand hauling trip to
 
Buffalo Bayou and"borrow" a few tubs from the c
ounty right of way.
 Today was
 
the day, and we make an excursion by taking neighbor c
hildren, the dogs and
 
exploring the Park nearby, its woods, caves, grape-vine s
winga,log bridges, etcetry.
 
Actually, Margared passed on today's jaunt--just c
ouldn't stand the "costrazestra",
 
a word Johnny has coined to signify a grand c
elebration.
 She is very well, thank
 
you, and now busily is a knitting on some Xmas stockings.
 Says she married into
 
an interesting family, but they j
ust never visit, or even s
eldom write letters.
 
As some know, we went to Dllaa for the Fair, enjoyed the
 
Okla. T
exas game and had good times with Deanie.
 She i
s in good health and
 
spirits, heiag bolstered by a good report by her Doctor on a check-up.
 Her otLy
 
sign  of advancing years i
s absent-mindedness.
 She has a big batch of reviews
 
of Jelly Roll Morton, and both Margaret and I are impressed by the z
w en-
c
omiums heaped and he ped.
 Sure makes me proud of my brother.

You will note that exteision of the aboee, and a value of

. new:
 
-
 trong1y opining that '
there should be litti
 
tax on the estate.
 This premise baseE
 
c
i fact that the
 of the estate willed to us children

tually ours as Iwtherrs half as soon a s she died.
 How ev ,
 
h she and Father willed all their property to the survlv
 
long as the survivor lived.
 Thus, it '

ever since 1931 (which -
fact is mentioned in his papers).

' this interpretatlon,thie much of their comriiunity prope:.

 at which time it w

 Yr. MacBean Is prer
 
LLie view to the Federal Tax authorities this week, and he sa
 
hat
 he feels sure it be accepted by themç, but that you neve'
 
ean be sure how they will react;
 if not, he says they will b
 
fight on their hands.
 Next, if all this goes through as h€
 
&iticipatee,  it means that our
 can be disbursed to us in th
 
.
car future,  rather than to wait for the year-out pro osition,
 
r ich we all prefer.
 Another importa t factor at stake is t
 
fact that, if this is rul&f

 So, we have a big plum at et

 Deani

and I will pass along the tidings.
 Shirley was to contac
 
both Mr. MacBean (again) and Mr. Waggener yesterday morni

before returning to Lubbock regarding the loan from the B

that Bess and

sure that Deanie has written you the developments.
 The ba
 
;ay not want to go to the trouble to make such a c mp icate;
 
loan (whi h M z type Mr. MacBean told us they seldom, if ev
 
make) if they feel that the children's property is to be
 
in the near future, which wonid liquidate the loan after

ill and  Ihave decided to
 
:ive valuation 1 yar from now (and possible saving in inheritance tax) oid
 
ress the Bonk to settle this estate as soon as possible.
 There are man;
 
rri1ls and us named so that any saving wouldn't amount  to much per indi\
'i oal
 
involved.
 The will features several bequests,  the only one involving us is a
 
nice one to Bess,  in which the fine Spenserian hands of Shirley and Margaret
 
nore ± x ±x i the guides.
 The residue goes
 to the 8 Terrill nieces and nephews
 
cnd  ; to the 4 of us.

 He has taken excellent care of the house so far, would like _
tM k w for
 
is Mission to buy it for his occupancy and their future use and has written
 
is headquarters for its druthers •
 Such a sale wo ld have advantages to us:
 
l prompt action, 2) Cash, rather than extended payments likely from a nuwal
 
cuyer, and

 no sales commission to an agent.
 In this case we would teraiiccts
 
is lease by mutaual agreement, the 4 us execute the deed,  leaving only the prcLi-
of the furnishings to be disposed of. -
 If not sld to the Mission, Bill's lease

ith reference to the 4 shares of W. F. Hall Printing Coupany
 
Stock, we have not yet received this back from the Tr a
nsfer Agent
 
and of c
ourse cannot s
ell the s
ame until we receive the s
ame from
 
the Transfer Agent.  As soon as we receive this stock from the
 
Transfer Agent, we will s
ell the same and forward you a check for
 
the oroceeds.  harl:et on this stock i

i
th reference t
o your enquiry as to whether there will be any
 
tax due on this transaction, it is our opinion that there will be
 
no estate tax due but there may possibly be a capital gains tax
 
due on the difference between the value of the stocks at the date
 
of your l
iother' s death, Hay 8
, 1931, and the amount of money that
 
you received through the sale of these s
ecurities.  This capital
 
gains t
ax, of c
ourse, will not be due until Harch 15 next year
 
when you make out your income tax return and would be limited on
 
long term capital gains to 25% of the profit.  I am not at all
 
c
ertain that such a tax would be due under all the circumstances
 
and would suggest that you talk to your income tax advisor about
 
this matter.
 
In order that you night have s
oric figr es t
c l
:ok at, I have at-
tempted to get the value of the various stocks s
old as of the date
 
of your Hother's death, and as well as I can determine from an
 
investigation here in Dallas, the following schedule will show you
 
such value and the amount that you received for the stocks s
old:

Mr. Alan Lomax

Dear Mr. Lomax:
 
Re:  John A. Lomax Estate
 
We wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of June 7 with reference
 
to the matter of book rights and royalties.
 
We wish to advise you that the will of your father and the agreement
 
referred to in your letter only covers the interest that your father had in the
 
books published under his name and
. yours.
 
I am enclosing a copy of a letter from Mrs. Lomax, whicL I think you
.
 
have Dreviously received a copy of, which sets out her recollection of the division
 
of these book rights and royalties.  In view of this letter and the conversation
 
had with you while in the bank, our records at present indicate the division of
 
royalties and book rights to be made as follows:
 
Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads -
 all to John A. Lomax
 
Songs of the Cattle Trail and the Cow Camp -
 all to John A. Lomax
 
American Ballads and Polk Songs -
 One-hplf to John A. Lomax and one-half
 
to Alan Lomax
 
Negro Songs as Sung by Lead
. Belly -
 One-half to John A. Lomax and one-half
 
to Alan Lomax
 
Our Singing Country -
 one-third to John A. Lomax, one-third to Alan Lomax
 
and one-third to Ruth Crawford Seeger
 
Folk Songs USA -
 One third to John A. Lomax, one-third to Alan Lomax and
 
one third to Charles and Ruth Seeger.
 
I have gone over the Seeger correspondence which you forwarded to me
 
recently with reference to royalty and '
book rights on Polk Songs USA and find it
 
to be inconclusive as to their interest and feel that the bank will have to be
 
governed by what the Lomax family agrees to.
 
After you have reviewed the above division, if it i
s in accordance
 
with your knowledge of the same, please s
ign the attached copy of this letter
 
and return it to us in the enclosed envelope.
 
Kindest personal regards.
 
Yours very truly,

 If any undivided money dribble, into

ve been given tae job of rasseling with the folk lore material in ths
 
our old house hero in Dallas, and find that the main job is with the books.  Most
 
of fath e
r '
s manuscript has already been sent to Harvard (apparently when he wr te
 
his will he was s
till s
ore at the Univers i
t y of Texas and he therefore sent his
 
material to Harvard).  The U. of T
. has micro-filmed a great deal so far as I can
 
ther, however.
 
Anyway, there are quite a few books on folklore and eong s
till araini th e
 
I
:ouse  coodn e
es knows how many Alan hasix or how manr people have j
ust walked off
 
;
vith. we really don't quite know what should be done with them.  My brother John
 
could keep them in his big house in Houston; I could keep them. I am sure that,
 
if Alan really gets here, he will want to take th em.,-" However, I have s
ome feelins;
 
th
at so
me of the material should be in libraries, or at least offered for micro-
filming.  Perhaps we should offer the entire collection to a lilrary -
 in that
 
case, I should suppose it wild be Harvard since that i
s were Father willed  his

rt of broke d'n at the a

 r mu cn L
p preci to it if you would
 
look over the list and l
et me know immed i
ately if there are any books of real ix
 
value, either to book iii1eezti co l
lectors or scholars.  Some of the autogr  tad
 
first editions might have more value to book c
 oi
l e
ctore than they do to us - -
f
 o
r example sane of the Dobie books possibly*  O
thers might be s
D rare that 'e
 
should really turn them over to apxbika an institution for scholarly use.
 
Our idea is that, armed with this infcvmation,we will be better able to cane to z
 
sensible decision as to disposing of the books. I suspect that what will happen
 
is that we will just divvy them up an ng us;
 with the list we will at is s
t
 
k P who has what.  My sense of the fitness of things, however, wcti't let me
 
Luth,rize any one of us going off with s
omething that might have real value for
 
at least without knowing ill
 
I'm s
orry for the incoherence of all the a
bove; I have been interrupted ii
 
least forty times per paragraph and also am pretty well pie-eyedfroni the enormous
 
piles of st uff we have all been digging th roug
h.  We hope tQ finish and be out of
 
here by next Monday morning at the latest (August 20th). ,
So after you look at tti e
 
enclosed list, would you call me collect -
-  DAvis 7-795& if ti re is anything e
s-
'
-'
ecially to be watched out for?  Then would you return the list Air Mail Speci.1
 
to me at 8170 San Bonito Way, Dallas Texas
; put our  Palm Court .
r&&wlreturn address
 
on it in case it misses us.  I'll enclose a self-addressed envelope s
o you won't
 
s
a 
to do any at wo
rk except to glance through the list and mark any items of
 
interest.  We will all be very grateful; and in terms of a !azx
wk retu r

Dear Mr. Lomax:
 
I am g
lad now t
o s
end you a c
umulative report on the
 
reprint edition of FOLIC SONG U S A
.
 This reprint edition
 
was lone, a
s you know, in 19 3 by Grosset O
t T
)
unlop under t
he
 
t
itle, "
Best Loved American Folk S
ongs; it was
 made t
hrough
 
the agency of Little Brown which was at that time authorized
 
to license reprint editions for Duel-I,, Sloan a
nd Pearce.
 
The statement is in two parts •
 Part two covers a group
 
of checks issued by Little Brown which never c
leared t
heir a
c-
count and a s
econd group which were drawn incorrectly and had
 
t
o be returned for correction.  L
ittle Brown has issued re!].ace-
ment checks covering all amounts due and these we enclose.
 
Part one consists of an a
ccount of sales and payments made
 
for the e
arlier period of the reprint and is a
ccompanied by copies
 
of t
he s
upporting royalty statements.  I have not been a
ble to
 
pinpoint the amounts marked A and B
, but will either confirm pay-
ment on these within the next ten days or reimbursement will be
 
made.
 
I am sending the statements and checks for Mrs. Mansell and
 
Mrs. Haves a
long w
ith your own a
nd request your rood offices in
 
sending t
hem on in the attached, stamped envelopes.  I
 wanted t
o
 
be s
ure the addresses were current.
 
We shall very much appreciate it if the enclosed checks are
 
presented for payment at your earliest convenience s
o t
hat this pro-
tracted matter can be cleared up.  Needless t
o say you have our s
in-
cere apologies.
 
Sincerely,
 
Mr. John A

At the request of The University of Texas, I
 have examined the
 
collection of l
etters and research materials which you have re-
cently donated to the University.
 
The collection consists of approximately 1
,000 l
etters between
 
John A. and Ruby Lomax, 1
910-1948, on personal matters and
 
on the collecting of American folklore, and a small collection
 
of original photographs, c
lippings, reviews, folklore research
 
notes, and miscellaneous material, a
ll in s
ix f
ile boxes.
 
The collection has, i
n my opinion, a retail value -
of $4,000.00.

How are you?  G
lad you l
iked the t
ape.
 I don't expect I
'll  b
e
 
doing a lot of producing as it r
eally bores me to be cooped up i
n a
 
studio for hours at a t
ime.
 I w
ill  probably do more a
lbums w

D
avid t
hough, s
ince I have fun working w
ith h
im.
 
Our l
ittle l
abel  has managed to s
ign up a young, b
lack s
inger
 
n
amed Bob Bailey who has had a gospel  background.
 He wanted to change
 
over to secular music about the t
ime we c
ame a
long so he became our
 
f
irst artist.
 He's truly sensational, a
s f
ine a s
inger as I
've heard
 
i
n the soul/R&B/gospel  vein.
 Can't wait to get the f
inal m
ixes a
nd
 
send up a tape.
 
And,  I
'm sure t
hat you've heard of M
ickey Newbury.
 The l
abel
 
seems to be starting out r
ight -
-
 two of our acts are Texans, one i
s
 
from A
laska and Bob Bailey i
s from Ohio and Washington state.
 
A
lan, this b
usiness about Shirley and t
he furniture has gone far
 
enough.
 I ask you t
o p
lease consider t
he facts of the matter before
 
you bombard me further w
ith entreaties on her b
ehalf.
 The saddest part
 
i
s that I don't believe any of the furniture i
n question (
for which I
 
h
ave never been furnished a l
ist) remained at Joe's.
 I left the house
 
i
n Houston i
n 1
968 and never l
ived t
here again, save for v
isits.
 Joe
 
d
id specifically w
ill  the brass bed t

s a c
hild's
 
rocker at Jeannie's.
 Beyond that t

 Believe me, if
 
t

I have spoken t

 When I called Aunt Shirley t
o tell  her about it she wasn't even
 
sure if she wanted it.
 She c
alled back to request that it be shipped
 
d
irectly i

 We have done so, at considerable expense (
borne
 
by t

Quiet and Different L
ife Today
 
T
HE usual r
esponse of those asked t
o s
ing was enthusiastic:
 
"Let me g
it on t
hat machine!"
 
Mrs. Lomax went among t
hese people without hesitancy or
 
f
ear. Only once was she denied entrance t
o a dangerous prison
 
ward f
or f
ear she might be used as a hostage.
 
She became well acquainted with two c
onvicts I
n particular —
 
Lead Belly, l
ater a s
inger o
f national r
eputation, and a
 character
 
known as I
ron Head. Both were paroled t
o Mr. Lomax and both a
t
 
various t
imes occupied t
he s
ervant house behind t
he f
a mily's
 
Austin home.
 
Once the Lo maxes r
eturned f
ro m a t
rip t
o f
ind I
ron Head i
n
 
jail again. He o
ffered a succinct explanation: "
I du mb a
 porch."
 
Mrs. Lo max l
eads a quiet and very d
ifferent l
ife t
oday. Much
 
of her t
ime I
s devoted t
o the First Baptist Church's Bethanian
 
Bible c
lass, which she has t
aught f
