There's a

At,d it's known as fair Erin's green isle ; 
Sure it's there I 
was born on is bright summer's morn. 
And with joy my relations did smile. 
My father and mother. my sister and brother, 
Were pleased, to- be- sure, all the while. 
rhey shed tears of joy, for their bright Irish boy, 
That was horn on fair Erin's green i!4e. 
You may talk about France, or England or Spain, 
Of their beautiful maids and g,reut men ; 
But the whole world does know that fair Erin can show, 
Nobler sons, truer daughters, than them. 
Such names as O'Connell and Moore I 
will mention, 
And brave Duke of Wellington, while 
King Brian lioroghue, and our bold Emmett to, 
tlaw the light on fair Erin's Green Isle. 
There's the Killarney lakes on Erin's Green fele, 
They're so lovely enchanting and fine 
Sure the valley's and muuntain's are mooed to aAIL 
For their beauty is really sublime 
There grows in profusion the dear little 
Encouraged by Nature's sweet :

So I

REGAN'S PARTY, 
WORDS AND MUSIC BY wM CARROLL. SUNG BY THE =RPM. 
MUSIC PUB. & COPYRIGHT, 1881 BY WM. J. A. LLEDER. 
It was over at old Regan's house, we had a 
jolly time, 
There was lots of dancing, I 
tell you it was line, 
Oh ! the boys and girls enjoyed themselves, for 
they came far and near, 
And all the lads assembled there, to try old 
Regan's beer. 
Old Regan he felt lively for a 
time, 
And a 
happier man I 
don't think could be found, 
Ile told us that the house was ours, tp do just as 
we liked., 
So then we had a 
drink of bear all round, 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! such singing, and such dancing pon my 
word 'twas really grand, 
And the music sounded just as well as if it was a 
band, 
While Murphy played the fiddle, they danced 
up and down the middle, 
And we never left old Regah till the morn. 
'There was Mary Jones and Jerry Flynn got up 
to dance a 
jig, 
Along with Michael Cronin's wife, who looked 
like Murphy's pig, 
The floor they welted beautiful, and went round 
hand in hand, 
But Cronin's wife she danced so much that she 
could hardly stand, 
Then James O'Brien he got up to sing a 
song, 
But they did not seem to relish it one bit, 
They yanked him out so gently that he thought 
his time had come, 
And the poor old fellow fell into a 
fit. 
Chorus. 
They danced away till broad daylight, the sun 
broke in the sky, 
But McCarthy's wife was so fatigued, she thought 
she'd really die, 
M'Guinuess got overpowered on wine and lager beer, 
He felt so good he tried to do a 
pirouette on his ear, 
And poor old Jerry_ Dolan was found sleeping 
With a 
vice like grip upon a 
china cup, 
And when they danced the last quadrille the 
fiddler fell asleep, 
And that's what wound old Regan's party up.

MAN 'YOU, DON'T 'MEET

I've a

In the beautiful County Kildare, 
I've got acres of land, and men at command, 
And I 
have always a 
shilling to spare. 
Och! I 
didn't come here, boys, in search of a

But just a

There's the man you don't meet every day.

Then call for your glasses, just have what you want, 
And whatever the damage I'll pay; 
Bhoys be airy and free when you're drinking wid me, 
For I'm the man you de,n't meet every day. 
When I 
landed in Glasgow, what a 
sight met 
my eyes, 
As I 
first put ray foot on the shore; 
There was Felix O'Donough, blind Barney McGurk, 
And a 
round two or three dozen more. 
Och tuurther! you ought to have seen them 
all stare, 
And then they did all run away; 
Says I, •‘ my spalpeens, do you think I'm a 
ghost, 
Because I'm a 
man you don't meet every day. 
Chorus. 
I'm in love with a 
nice little girl in town, 
And we're going to be married to-day. 
And if you come over a 
twelvemonth from now, 
A 
right welcome to all I 
will pay. 
And I 
think I 
can show you a

Who then will be able to say---
To my friends round about, while yointing me out',

Where bounteous nature her best doth appear in; 
And choicest of gifts scatters free.

Fair and as fresh as the morn, 
Ever in battle thy sons they are fearless,' 
Death do they hold but in scoan.

Those in distress never turned from the door, 
And for our country we'll brave every danger, 
The home of the shamrock, old Ireland asthore. 
Chorus. 
I 
love the bright green, and I'm proud boys to wear it 
To it I'll ever be true, 
All Loyal Irishmen that feeling share it, 
Deeply indeed as I 
do. 
Distance or climate that bond cannot sevea, 
Firm in our hearts all the wide world 
The land of St. Patrick, forget it no never; 
The home of the shamrock, ould Ireland asthore.

Ther'es a 
dear spot of land far out on the ocean. 
The prettiest island that ever was seen; 
There's no place on earth that so well suits 
my notion. 
It's the Emerald isle where the shamrock is green. 
Alas I 
the bold tyrant has taken possession. 
And driven our daughters and sons to exile, 
For no one could stand their tyranic aggression, 
And banished are we from the Emerald Isle. 
CHORUS. 
Then its God speed the day that will dawn with 
our freedom, 
When the stars and the harp shall be blended as one, 
Then the poor of ould Ireland will need no help 
to feed them, 
They'll belong to the country c ?
nave Washington. 
When I 
left my dear home n 
c) /Icor heart was 
breaking, 
Oh ! 'tis a 
sad moment the parting of friends, 
The tear-be-dimed eyes, and the honest 
hand-shaking. 
Oh I 
that causes the stoutel of hearts to unbend, 
But. there are occasions when 
..rdings a 
pleasure, 
And one is in crossing the beautiful sea; 
Where toil is rewarded by friendship and treasure, 
In the home of the brave and the land of the free.

TO THE CITIZENS OF CLEVELAND, OHIO. 
-With steady step, and muffled drum, 
The cortege passed along; 
And dreaded silence reigned supreme 
Amid the mighty throng. 
The scenber tolling of the bells, 
Reminded us in time we must 
Just like our President, 
Return from dust to dust. 
Men with heads uncovered, 
Would mutter Guitaa's name; 
And the wishes of each one, 
I 
am certain were the same. 
And if from jail he once were free, 
No power on earth could save 
The man that sent mir President 
To his untimely grave. 
We saw the streets in mourning, 
Which ever way you would go; 
And every one their sympathy 
In some way tried to show. 
Many a 
wife and mother, 
A 
fervent prayer has said, 
And taught it to their little ones 
Before they went to bed. 
And when the sufferer was laid 
In his last resting place, 
'Then came an aged colored man, 
With the tears running down his face.' 
He bought a 
little bouquet, 
With a 
card marked Uncle Dave, 
Be said it was all he had to give 
For Master Gartield's grave. 
Bow sad it is, indeed, to see 
His patient hopeful wife, 
And and gray haired mother, 
For him she would give her life, 
How different their feelings were, 
While about him they did stand; 
When honored with the highest place, 
There is in our free land. 
Let us hope that his successor, 
Will be as fit to rule, and be a 
man 
That can't be made the politician's tool, 
Bo peaceful rest the ashes of our soldier, 
'True and brave, and our nation's tears 
Will moist the earth on James A Garfield's-GraW,

In eighteen linndred and sixty one, 
The war it first broke out; 
The poor unfortunate Irishmen 
Were scattered all about. 
The rich man would not go and fight. 
But for the poor ones they did hunt; 
Then hand in hand to Dixie's land, 
Went the Irishmen to the front. 
CHORUS. 
Then give a 
cheer for we Yankee boys 
For the enemy we must hunt, 
So hand in hand to Dixie's Land, 
Went the Irishmen to the front. 
When we got on board the train, 
We had not been long gone; 
Until we found our enemy; 
Were about ten thousand strong. 
We sent back telegraph despatches, 
And such time was never made, 
When Gen McClellan our little Mac, 
Led on the Irish Brigade. 
So now me Yankee comrades, 
Don't harm an Irishman, 
For,Paddies door is open for you.

I 
have a 
daughter of great renown, 
in the ballet she dances in a 
theatre up tows; 
She's a 
darling to me, and so pretty you see, 
Is this girl of mine, Biddy McGee. 
She wears tarletan skirts all covered with tin,. 
She's as an angel a 
soul without sin; 
She's a 
dancer, you see, in the tra-la-la-lee, 
Is this girl of mine, Biddy McGee. 
( ; HoRus. 
She waltzes and pivots so neat en her toes, 
(gym) 
As 'round and 'round and ' round she goes; (77a%) 
Now there's one thing sure I 
can't understand, 
Why her name on the bills should read 
Madam Du Itnri, 
She high-tened wants to be, but she's Irish you see. 
And her right name is Biddy McGee. 
I 
taught lur tile skip, the hop, and the dip, 
To the tune of a 
fiddle around she would tripi. 
She's of high degree, and takes after me, 
Doe's this girl of mine, Biddy McGee. 
She's a 
voice like a 
bell, though I 
never could tell. 
Where she got it, or how, 'tis a 
mystery as well; 
l'or she's so full of glee, when dancing you see, 
Is this girl of mine, Biddy McGee.

O'er the waves ‘Ne swiftly go, 
Heedless of the sailor's warning.

And the charms within our reach 
Make our hearts with joy elated, 
Off fur Coney Island Beach

Some may sail across the ocean, 
Which is far beyond our reaok, 
While we find enough commotion, 
Down on Coney Island Beach. 
Many pleasures now surround us, 
On this breezy summer day, 
And with charming friends around us, 
O'er the waves we speed away, 
Till we reach that isle of gladness, 
Which is just within our teach, 
Where we banish an our sadness, 
Down on Coney Island Beach. 
In the chilling surf we shiver, 
But o .r 
hearts are light and free. 
While the wavelets dance and quiver. 
Rolling in from depths of sea. 
And the breeze is softly blowing,

LAKE SHORE ON SUNDAY NIGHT, 
WRITTEN AND SUNG Dr FRANK LUM. 
I 
am going to sing a 
funny song, 
And the subject is not very long, 
It's all about the funny sights, 
On the lake shore on a 
Sunday night, 
Such droves of people I 
declare. 
From five till ten, are walking there, 
All other streets deserted quite, 
For the Lake Shore on a 
Sunday night. 
Cuonus. 
Oh ! if you doubt then what I 
say, 
Go yourself most any day, 
to yourself and see the sights, 
On the lake shore on Sunday night. 
There are bachelors gay sporting away, 
Laughing and talking with maidens gay, 
And old maids you will often find 
With little poodle dogs behind, 
ks. ! 
don't they one another squeeze, 
It's when they feel the evening breeze, 
If the stars could speak tell tales they might, 
Of Lake View Park on Sunday night. 
Chorus. 
I'll tell you what me most annoys, 
It is to see so many naughty boys, 
Running around with common cigars, 
When they should be home with their 
pa's and mak 
• 
And young girls scarce sixteen years old, 
Running around them so bold, 
And doing things that isn't right, 
On the Lake Shore on Sunday night, 
Chorus, 
Young widows tired of single life, 
Wishing to become again a 
wife, 
Are trying with mally a 
wicked leer, 
To catch a 
stylish husband dear. 
And gay young sports a 
strolling along, 
Singing " Maggie Gordon" or some love sem 
With sweethearts under their arm so tight, 
On the Lake Shore on Sunday night.

Let cowardly slanderers say what they will, 
Against the dear land of my birth, 
But I 
will maintain she always will be, 
The grandest old spot on the earth. 
Some say with a 
sneer, we are cowards at heart, 
Fit for nothing but drinking potheen, 
But I 
throw back the villainous lie in their teeth, 
They're as brave as the shamrock is green.

Assist, at least, if you can, 
Remember that Pat on many a

Has proved that he is a 
true man: 
Remember the Celts and the Saxons are bound, 
By the ties of pure brotherly love; 
Come test him again, and you'll find him as true 
As the stars in the heavens above. 
And always give honor where honor is due, 
Let hands join'd in friendship be seen, 
For he who despises a

Is not fit for a

When she sits beside me now, there's a

As a 
soft and gentle hint, 
And soon upon my lips my love 
A 
greeting did impriot; 
But while intoxicated 
With its measure deep of bliss, 
Alas! my mamma witness was,, 
Of our delicious kiss. 
"Au explanation I

And in such trembling accents that. 
I 
ventured this to say.

I 
couldn't sky his kisses, ma. 
And didn't care to try. 
Of kisses of all sorts and kinds., 
I've surely had Inv share, 
From f,rinal kiss of friendship, 
To love s 
salutation rare; 
But of them all I'm free to own,

Was the first kiss of love which oped

I 
think I've the right to tell you about

A 
day cannot pass but I 
get a 
new name, 
You numbskull, you fool, dunce, and such, 
For me to talk thus you might say 'tis a 
shame, 
But really, my wife talks too much. 
CHORUS. 
Now John, come and kiss me, oh! do have a 
care, 
One'cl think you were kissing a 
mule; 
Why John, youv'e been drinking to-day, I 
declare! 
You're leading the life of a 
fool, 
Before we were married, you promised you know. 
We'd lead a 
most happy gay life; 
_But since we are married I 
find 'tisn't so, 
I'm only your talkative wife. 
One evening while kissing she said have a 
care, 
Oue'd think you were kissing a 
mule, 
I 
said as a 
joke, I 
just kissed one, my dear, 
I 
know not that I 
was a 
fool. 
She scratched me, she pinched me, she wept and she said 
You're mean, you're a 
brute, so you are, 
And she cried as she tore some nice locks from my head, 
rm going right back to my ma. Chorus. 
Now here at- election I 
bet a 
new hat, 
Of course ' twas a 
very small cost, 
But she keeps saying why did you do that? 
Whr bet on the men that have lost. 
There s 
Jenkins next door, whose as cute as a 
horse, 
Has several new suits while you've none; 
Itow when did he get them, he won them of course,

ISIING WITH IMMENSE SUCCESS BY PALMS & CUSIOR: 
Kind friends pay attention, and to you we will menticu. 
Some thoughts that of late have come into our minds; 
The first is of Ireland our poor bleeding country, 
To speak of her wrongs now I 
do feel inclined. 
To praise up her heroes, who ne'er knew what fear was, 
Who fight well in battle, as everyone knows; 
The back bone of England is her Irish army, 
The boys that are reared where the green 
shamrock gran, 
Now where is the nation can equal old Ireland, 
Go search o'er this world you cannot but find; 
That her sons are as brave as the lion in the forest, 
If you meet them in battle they prove they're no fiat. 
In peace or in war they are full of good humor, 
When called for to fight they are ready to go; 
Now those are the boys that are reared in old Ireland, 
The place where the beautiful shamrock does grow... 
Then many more great men to you I 
could mention, 
Who die in exile from their dear country; 
I 
mean those orators who are in English prisons 
It's when they are dying they let them go free, 
They're forced for to roam into far distant climates. 
To sink or to swim they are bound for to go; 
Now this is the way that our great men are treated, 
That belong to the land whore the green 
shamrock grove. _

And invited all the young ft Iks gay and hearty, 
There was handsome Paddy Grace, 
Sure he's now on the police,

party. 
He came from ( 70umy Cork, 
To the City of New York, 
He joked and sang and made us all feel hearty.

A 
h ! the charming, Widow Clancy, 
She was any man's fancy, 
She wAs a 
fluent talker, and a 
rattling six-day walke-i, 
And a 
Venus is the charming Widow Clancy. 
McGinn sang Pin- a- fore. 
I 
ill his throat was very sore, 
And " Little Dudeen. — sang by Smith so sweetly, 
Crosby saw , a 
liti le ditty, 
The girl.. all eaFetl him witty, 
And MeGuffio done an Irish jig so neatly. 
Flynn sang. " Dancing on the green," 
Also •• She's a 
fairy queen." 
Fkod sang " Held the fort for we're the 
strongest party,* 
And Murphy and 'I

Down at the charming Widow Clancy's party, Cho. 
As it was growint.; late, 
Sure we tho't was bime to ate, 
We went in two by two's down to the supper, 
We were hardly seated right, 
When there was a 
fearful fight, 
For IleGuinne,:s swore the whiskey was all water, 
All around ' twas hand to hand, 
And they nearly killed the band, 
When iu stepped the famous boxer Mike McCarthy. 
He swore by the powers above, 
That he'd just put on the gloves, 
And clear out every sucker in the party.

Oh I 
we're the brother's Dobkili and we doesn't 
care by jovel. 
So long as we get three meals each day, 
We're called two blarsted Englishmen, two 
regular crooked an" 
It makes no odds what people think or say. 
We Were born in Lancashire, our accent does 
prove queer. 
To think of those days they always make us smile; 
How the lads would dance and sing and make 
the old clogs ring. 
For they're the chaps could do it up in style. 
CHORUS. 
So to-night we took a 
notion to put our feet in motiott, 
Sit up straight and listen for awhile; 
We'll endeavor to show to you, in a 
style 
that's somewhat new, 
Some clog steps in good old English style. 
Ah at sparring we're two good ones, at cards 
we take the cake. 
At billiards we were never beat a 
game; 
We can row a 
boat or swim, no matter what's 
the stake. 
We're bound to win the money just the same. 
But of all the games we play to carry us away, 
And cheer our spirits up when we're feeling blue, 
Is whenever we get a 
chance for to try a 
little dance, 
And rattle off an English step or two.

When the birds are singing in the glittering Banal** 
There's none so fair as this pretty girl of mine, 
I

My pretty little beau, 
One summers night when the moon shone bright, 
Where pretty lilacs grow. (Dimes.) 
There is a 
happy day to come, 
A 
day I'll never dread, 
When together to the church we go, 
And this pretty little maid I 
wed. 
Where the little birds are singing in the tree, 
We'll ramble to and fro, 
And na'er forget where first we met, 
Whore pretty lilacs grow.

I 
thought I 
would confess; 
I 
asked my love to be my bride, 
She softly whispered " yes,"

It made me glad and gay, 
To know that she would be my wits,

Now in a

One painted white and gray, 
I

Here we are two factory lads, 
From Lancashire we came, 
Our parents in the cotton mill 
Are working now at home. 
But trade was slack, and pay is bad, 
So they sent us here 
To try and show you all the way 
They dance in Lancashire, 
CHORUS. 
We will make the wooden clogs go tap, bap, imp. 
If you'll but give a 
cheer, 
And 'twill give us great delight, 
To show you here to-night. 
How they dance in Lancashire. 
When at night our work is done, 
We dance out on the green, 
The lads and lassies all are there, 
With smiling faces seen. 
Now we've told you all our history, 
If you think us sincere, 
Bestow your kind applause upon 
These lads from Lancashire.

DON'T GO TO YOUR RELATIONS. 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY FRANK 
We all have our shares of ups and downs 
In every rank and station; 
We are sure to get more kicks and. frowns, 
If we depend ott kind relations. 
It's all very well once or twice to drop in, 
And ask for a 
lit,le in favor, 
But if by chance you go a 
third time, 
They'll construe it to your bad behavior 
CHORUS. 
So ray advice take one and all, 
In every rank and station, 
And if you want a 
favor done, 
Don't go to your relations. 
I 
speak from experience, and some you'll fist 
How often they'll invite you. 
But when poverty comes close behind, 
They will soon begin to slight you. 
It's clear away, there's a 
knock at the door, 
Don't open the door too wide John, 
I'm afraid it's that hungry brother of mine' 
Say I'm gone out for a 
ride, John. 
Chores 
I 
thought my sister would prove a 
friend, 
But soon she did deceive me, 
She said these times were not times to lend, 
She would if she could relieve me, 
A 
trifle sister, would keep me afloat. 
I 
shall sink if you don't arrange it. 
She said she'd no less than a 
five dollar not.4646no 
And she hadn't time to change it. 
I 
lost my goods but found that day, 
Though against me they had sinned all; 
Death called 'a 
rich old friend of mine, 
Who left me a 
handsome wind-fall. 
But how they altered what they said, 
Their ways were so provoking, 
To hear them say as they hung their heads, 
Why Frank we were only joking. 
Chomp 
There is none in this world so blessed as I, 
With so many kind relations, 
I 
am invited to breakfast, dinner, and tea, 
I've a 
hundred invitations. 
I 
refuse them all though my heart it burns, 
Their friendship I 
don't heed it, 
ilor I 
hate the cold heart that in poverty spurns, 
And only gives to thosA that don't need iCis*

7s. 
With the dawn of the morning from far and from near, 
The columns are marehing, and soon they appear, 
You see them approaching o'er hill and o'er dale, 
And each one is armed with a 
bright dinner pail. 
They may not seem warlike, thus simply arrayed, 
But they are the heroes of toil, the tin bucket brigade. 
'Neath the lid of the bucket. tho' humble it seems, 
Are rarest of dainties invitingly clean; 
Filled up to the brim with provident care, 
That the eater might have both enough and to share. 
Don't think it demeaning nor (loth it degrade, 
To carry the right of the bucket brigade. 
Hide not your position and be not afraid, 
To carry the right of the bucket brigade. 
To you my fine fellows, with scorn in your eyes, 
With disdain on your lips as you see them pass by, 
Consoling yourselves, you are not like those 
Poor greasy mechanics, in labor soiled clothes. 
Just think of the time when your own father made 
Your wealth, when he marched with the bucket brigadek 
And to all those rich fellows who once carried a 
pail, 
And think that the item's forgotten aid stale; 
Though they are worth thousands and carry no more, 
The old dinner bucket they carried of yore, 
Just think of the time when their own fathers made 
Their wealth vhen they marched with the 
bucket brigade.

A 
GOD AFTER ALL; 
AT THE BOARD OF EXAMINERS FOR PRIZE DECLAMATIONS, 
. MISS AMELIA. DEAN, WAS AWARDED THE FIRST PRIZE 07' 
$100,00 FOR THE RECITATION OF THE FOLLOWING.. 
We laid in a 
cold cell Mr. Judge, all night long, 
Jimmie and me, waitin' and wishin' for the 
morning's dawn, 
Cause we couldn't sleep, Mister Judge, in 
that cold damp place. 
And Jimmie was most scared to death, by the 
wild, mad race 
That the rats kept runnin' all through the:dark night; 
That's why we're glad, Mr. Judge, to see the daylight, 
Please, Mr. Judge, we are not very bad little beys, 
And the policeman what took us said we're 
some mother's joys, 
He was wrong, Mr. Judge, and should only have said 
That we are two little outcasts, and our mother is dead, 
And there's no one to care for us, at least here below. 
And no roof that shelters us from the rain and 
the snow.. 
A 
preacher once told us that way up in the bIue. 
There was a 
God that was watching all that 
little boys dc.-
And that He loved little children, and His love 
was freo; 
CONTINUED. 
But I 
guess, Mr. Judge, He don't love Jimmie or me; 
For I 
prayed, and I 
prayed till I 
was most out 
of breath, 
For something to ea t, and 
t
o keep Jimmie from death. 
And that's why we're here, Mister Judge; for 
you know, 
There was no help from above, I 
must find it below; 
sTwas no use beggin' and be told in God I 
must trust. 
For I'd begged all the day and got never a 
crust; 
And there was pcor Jimmie, holdin' his 
cold little feet, 
And cryin' and moanin' for somethin to eat. 
Bo I 
went to a 
house that was not very far, 
And saw, Mr. Judge, that the back door was ajar: 
And a 
table was settin' right close to the door, 
Just loaded with pies, about twenty or more. 
So quickly I 
slipped in and grabbed one to my breast— 
The policeman then caught us, and you know the rest. 
Discharged, did you say, Mister Judge ? 
both Jimmie and I 
And—we ain't got to be jailed 'cause I 
took a 
pie ? 
And we can eat what we want?—how funny twill seeni. 
Say, Jimmie, pinch me, for I - I 
think it's a 
dream, 
And you'll give us work, summer, winter and fall-
-Say, Jimmie ! I 
think there's a 
God after all.
