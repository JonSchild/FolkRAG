Bryan Wassel interviewed by Vyta Pivo on May 25, 2021 at the Lehigh Cement Company 
Plant in Nazareth, Pennsylvania. The interview transcript has been edited for clarity.  
 
[00:00:00] 
 
Vyta Pivo: 
Today is Tuesday, May 25th, 2021. This is an interview for the occupational 
history archive, which is part of the Folklife Center at the Library of Congress, funded by the 
Archie Green Fellowship. As part of this project, I'm interviewing cement workers in the 
Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania, the birthplace of the modern cement industry in the United 
States. The recording and transcript will become part of the permanent collection at the 
Library of Congress. I’m Vyta Pivo and today I am speaking with Brayan Wassel at the 
Lehigh Cement Company Nazareth Plant in Nazareth, Pennsylvania. And just to confirm, you 
give me your permission to record the interview, is that right?  
 
Bryan Wassel:      Yes. 
 
VP: 
Thank you. So, could you tell me your full name, your year of birth, and where you 
were born?  
 
BW: 
Brian Joseph Wassel, 1981 and born in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania.  
 
VP: 
And is that where you grew up?  
 
BW: 
Yeah, that's where I was born, yes, until ninth grade, when we moved to Easton.  
 
VP: 
And that’s in the area of the Lehigh Valley? 
 
BW: 
Yes, just about.   
 
VP: 
And so, when did you first learn about of cement as a material and an industry?  
 
[00:01:14] 
 
BW: 
Oh, when I was younger, I knew about it, but I didn't start working in it until six years 
ago.  
 
VP: 
And what were you doing before then?  
 
BW: 
I worked as a melter at Victaulic for nine years, the one in Forks Township and the 
one in Albertus.  
 
VP: 
And what did that job involve doing?  
 
BW: 
Well, the iron turning into casting, stuff like that, making pipe.   
 
VP: 
Making pipe, you said? 
 
BW: 
Mhm.  
2 
 
 
VP: 
And when did you start working in that field?  
 
BW: 
2007. I think it was 2006, because I was laid off from the Forks facility in 2008 when 
the market crashed and then I went to the Albertus one 2016 or 2015.  
 
VP: 
And so, why did you choose to shift to cement work?  
 
BW: 
It was closer to home, I only live 10 minutes away from here. It's basically the same 
thing I do, but I'm outdoors half of the time instead of locked up inside.   
 
VP: 
So what's your position at the plant?  
 
BW: 
Millwright.   
 
VP: 
And what do you do for your job?  
 
BW: 
Basically fix anything that's broken, patching holes, rebuilding equipment.  
 
VP: 
And so, can you tell me a little bit about, like, how your day goes?  
 
[00:02:50] 
 
BW: 
I’ll come in, morning we’ll have our safety meeting, they’ll give us jobs for the day, 
where we're going and what we're doing. We're just doing it, like what they call PM, 
preventative maintenance until something breaks down and get called. We try to get running 
as quick as possible, unless it’s catastrophic.  
 
VP: 
So, when do you typically start your day? 
 
BW: 
7 o'clock, 7-3:30 is our normal day.   
 
VP: 
Do you get a lunch break?  
 
BW: 
Yeah, noon.  
 
VP: 
And so how many people work on your team? Do you work alone?  
 
BW: 
I'm with four other guys at our plant, three, but in our department there is 18 of us 
total.  
 
VP: 
And is everyone doing different types of work?  
 
BW: 
They're always all over the place doing different things, unless they, typically we'll 
have like a down day so everybody will be somewhere in that area working on different 
equipment. So, like, if they have a [unclear] meltdown, somebody, basically the whole 
department’s all over that area there because the equipment is down for the day.  
 
VP: 
So, do you work in one specific plant or do you travel?  
 
3 
 
BW: 
I work here. I work in our plant 3, the quarry, and the pack house. And it’s all within 
five miles. So, it's all in town, in Nazareth.  
 
VP: 
And so do you have a company car?  
 
BW: 
Yes, a truck.  
 
VP: 
And so do you, like, focus on one plant at a time, or is it kind of varied?  
 
BW: 
Well, like yesterday they call over, it wasn't much for us over there. So, they pulled 
two of us to come over here and give a hand with these guys and their workload so that they 
didn't get behind.  
 
VP: 
So, what type of work are were you working on yesterday?  
 
[00:04:52] 
 
BW: 
Well, we were working on the belt line for the finish mill because the finish mill was 
down all day. And then they had a breakdown at the pack house, and the guy I was partnered 
up for the day, we have to go over there and take care of that to get them back running.  
 
VP: 
Do you sometimes just walk around the plant to see what’s wrong?  
 
BW: 
Yeah, well, that's what they'll give it, that's what our PMs are doing. All right, this is 
your area for your PM, do your inspections and you just go take a walk, see if you can find 
something that they can schedule for another down day or if it's something that needs to be 
taken care of right away to figure out how we take the equipment down and fix it.  
 
VP: 
So, you don't really know what you'd be doing for the day.  
 
BW: 
No 
 
VP: 
Is that exciting? 
 
BW: 
I like that better. When I worked in the steel mill, it was the same thing every single 
day for eight, nine years. Got tedious at times. But here it's different every day, you never 
know.  
 
VP: 
Do you feel like there are some skills that you brought from the steel plant to the 
cement plant?  
 
BW: 
Yes.  
 
VP: 
Like what? 
 
BW: 
All the welding, fixing stuff, we used to tear all my stuff apart and put it back 
together, rebuilding some of the equipment, and they do a lot of that here with certain parts 
that they have here, so.  
 
VP: 
Do you do some welding yourself as well?  
4 
 
 
BW: 
Yeah, I like welding.  
 
VP: 
And there is a machine shop, too?  
 
BW: 
No, we used a machine shop years ago. We don't have it anymore. But it used to be 
right outside the window here.  
 
VP: 
What do you think is the most challenging part of your work?  
 
[00:06:34] 
 
BW: 
I don’t know, it's not really too challenging. Some of the hours start to get to you after 
a while, like when we go through our outrage, towards the end of it, it starts to drag your 
[unclear]. Basically, from the 1st of January, all the way to March almost every day, 10-12 
hours. But that's because we rebuild the whole plant to go for our campaign from March until 
Christmas, the next year. I hope not to have anything major happen.  
 
VP: 
Are there some jobs that are sort of more dangerous or that …  
 
BW: 
There could be if you're not paying attention or if you don't know what you're doing.  
 
VP: 
Are there particular jobs that you're most excited about or look forward to working 
on?  
 
[00:07:27] 
 
BW: 
Like do, I came in at 3:00 in the morning today to do a huge bearing job on one of our 
elevators at plant 3. I like doing it. So, that's the only reason I came in at 3:00 in the morning. 
Otherwise, I would be here at 7.  
 
VP: 
That’s very early. 
 
BW: 
Yeah.  
 
VP: 
What do you like about that work? 
 
BW: 
Just trying to figure out how to do it. We had to lift up the whole elevator and take the 
old one off. What we actually, we burn it off, melt the whole thing away and put the new one 
on.  
 
VP: 
Wow, how do you burn it off? 
 
BW: 
With oxygen acetylene, it’s a torch and you just melt the whole thing off, so.  
 
VP: 
How many people did it take to do that? 
 
BW: 
There’s me and three other guys that came out this morning. It's pretty heavy. 
 
VP: 
And it seems pretty dangerous if you’re melting things.  
5 
 
 
BW: 
Yeah, it can be.  
 
VP: 
So, you do have to kind of build trust with your coworkers.  
 
BW: 
Yeah, absolutely. You can't have somebody doing the wrong thing that you're not 
paying attention.  
 
VP: 
So, do you sometimes critique each other's work?  
 
BW: 
We try to help each other as much as we can, rather get it done safely and be done for 
the day. 
 
VP: 
When you have new workers come in, do you participate in training them? 
 
[00:18:42] 
 
BW: 
Yeah, we all do. Usually put the newer guys, take the ones that are green like that, 
never did it before. They'll put them with the older guys that have been here like 20-30 years. 
And some of the other guys that come from the plants, they’ll put them with the more senior 
guys till they get off their probation and get used to the facility here.  
 
VP: 
Do you remember doing that yourself when you were training to join the plant?  
 
BW: 
Oh, yeah, I as actually with Jack. I don't know if you met Jack.  
 
VP: 
Yeah! 
 
BW: 
That’s who I was with until I got off my probation when I came here.  
 
VP: 
How did you how did that go?  
 
BW: 
It was alright. It’s weird now that he's my boss. But yeah, it was good. He had thirty-
something years at the time that I was training with him.  
 
VP: 
Do you ever sort of feel bossed around at all?  
 
BW: 
No, not really.  
 
VP: 
And he’s training so many people? 
 
BW: 
He’s been here 47 years this month, I think. 
 
VP: 
That’s a long time! 
 
BW: 
Yeah. 
 
VP: 
What’s most challenging about training other people to do this work?  
 
6 
 
BW: 
Because there's not always one way to do it. There's different ways. So, you just got to 
keep an open mind because the way that you do it might not be the easiest way to do it, so.  
 
VP: 
Do you feel like there's also kind of a lot of room to come up with new ways?  
 
[00:10:20] 
 
BW: 
Oh, absolutely. There's stuff that they were doing for 30 years that the younger guys 
came in and were like, you guys have been doing this wrong for how long now? And now 
here’s an easier way to do it.  
 
VP: 
Have you had that experience yourself?  
 
BW: 
Yeah, a couple of times. Yeah, it's neat, so.  
 
VP: 
Do you have an example?  
 
BW: 
Just what the elevator today, we lifted it up. They normally jack it up, they lift the 
counter weight. We lifted the whole thing up, one shot, we slid everything off, put it back on. 
And usually takes all day to do what we did, but we're right there wrapping it up now as I’m 
here, so. 
 
VP: 
So, what types of tools did you need to do that work? 
 
BW: 
Pry bar, hammers, wedges. That’s about it, there’s not much to it. You just got to 
[unclear] to get it to where you need it.  
 
VP: 
Are there other particular tools that you use on a regular basis?  
 
BW: 
Yeah, I have like a bag that normally they just say your basic tools and then there's 
other jobs where you'll need to bring other stuff. But mostly like when you're with a group of 
guys between the two or the four of you, you got everything you need to do. It’s what it is.  
 
VP: 
And does the company provide the tools?  
 
BW: 
They provide most of them and then whenever we break them, they replace whatever 
we broke or become defective. They replace.  
 
VP: 
Do sometimes alter tools?  
 
BW: 
No, we're not allowed to. You’d get in trouble. 
 
VP: 
And do they inspect the tools, or how …  
 
BW: 
I've never had that happen, but we run by MSHA’s guidelines here and they’re 
government, so. You can't modify anything yet or use whatever it is for the purpose that it is. 
I've never seen them check anything, but they have the right to do, so.  
 
VP: 
And in general, how do managers supervise the work that you do? Is there supervision 
involved?   
7 
 
 
BW: 
There is, they a pop up on jobs to call say, hey, this is what's going on, we need this, 
this and this, and don't make the calls to get us the stuff that we need. Or wait ‘till a later date 
‘till we can get the stuff that we need to do it safely.  
 
VP: 
Is there … I know some people have like a favorite tool, so do you …  
 
BW: 
No, I don’t have a favorite tool.  
 
VP: 
Do you have a favorite car that you drive or … 
 
BW: 
You mean personal vehicle?  
 
VP: 
No, like a company truck.  
 
BW: 
Oh, no, no. Just whatever they give me, that can get me across Nazareth.  
 
VP: 
Are there particular jobs that you are not excited about?  
 
BW: 
Yeah, anything with higher reach. I don’t like heights, so. But they’re good with that. 
They know that.  
 
VP: 
Are there a lot of jobs with high …  
 
BW: 
Not really. And there's always guys who like to it anyway, so. But not me, I get a little 
goofy there.  
 
VP: 
They’re daredevils.  
 
BW: 
Yeah. There's a couple of them in our department. Not, I'm not one of them. Not at all.  
 
VP: 
So, they just like to be high up? 
 
BW: 
I guess, maybe they like going up in the lifts. I don't.  
 
VP: 
Is that maybe like a slightly more dangerous job you feel? 
 
BW: 
It is, it is.  
 
VP: 
Have people fallen?  
 
BW: 
No, not that I know of here.  
 
VP: 
So, what's it like to work outside all the time in the elements?  
 
[00:14:02] 
 
BW: 
It’s half outside, half and half? So, most days it's nice being outside, but when it’s 
raining it’s not.  
 
8 
 
VP: 
Do you have a special gear or … 
 
BW: 
Yeah, they provide us with rain jackets, stuff like that, for outside, and they try to 
keep us out of it unless it's something that needs to be done. But we have all the stuff we need 
for it.   
 
VP: 
And so do you feel like there's a kind of community here of coworkers?  
 
BW: 
Yeah, absolutely.  
 
VP: 
Do you do something to kind of foster that over time, to create community?  
 
[00:14:41] 
 
BW: 
Well, we go out a lot. Last year we were at Eagles games together. A lot of guys go to 
the dirt track racing together and a lot of guys motorcycle together in the summer. There’s a 
group like 10 or 12 of them that go out on weekends that they have off. Baseball games, stuff 
like that.  
 
VP: 
Are they part of a team or they just watch sports?  
 
BW: 
No, we go down to Philadelphia or something like that, watch Phillies games, Eagles 
games.   
 
VP: 
And do the families hang out as well?  
 
BW: 
Yeah, a lot of them do. A lot of the people in here, they went to, they went to school 
together. They grew up together.  
 
VP: 
And do you talk about cement after work? 
 
BW: 
No, no. As soon as you punch out, it’d one. At least for me, it is. I don't like to bring 
any of it home. 
 
VP: 
And do you have any relatives that have joined the cement industry? 
 
BW: 
Yeah, my brother. Well, about four months ago. Four or five months ago.  
 
VP: 
Where? 
 
BW: 
He's actually with me, I'm training him. He's my trainee right now, so.  
 
VP: 
Oh, wow. How did you decide to go into the industry?  
 
BW: 
Me. Because he was actually doing the same thing I was, but he was driving 45 
minutes the opposite direction in New Jersey. And they were looking for guys, I said, put in 
for an interview and see what happens, who knows? And they ended up hiring him. So, he 
loves it now.  
 
VP: 
So, what is he doing? He’s working with you …  
9 
 
 
BW: 
As maintenance.  
 
VP: 
Is that what he wants to do career-wise?  
 
BW: 
Well, that's what he was doing for eight years before coming here, too. And he kind of 
worked in a semi-steel mill, but almost doing the same thing. But they didn't make any of the 
cast, so.  
 
VP: 
What is it like to work with your brother?  
 
BW:  I don't know, it's only been four months, so we’ll see.  
 
VP: 
Has training been challenging? 
 
BW: 
No, not at all.  
 
VP: 
He doesn’t complain, or … 
 
BW: 
No, I joke with him. He’s younger, so I say you got no seniority at work and you got 
no seniority at home, so.  
 
VP: 
That’s amazing. Is that pretty common for folks to bring their siblings?  
 
[00:17:07] 
 
BW: 
There's a couple here. The other guy that I'm over with, at plant 3, his son works here. 
There's another father and son that are electricians. And there’s a couple of brothers that work 
here.  
 
VP: 
It's a kind of family business.  
 
BW: 
Mhm.  
 
VP: 
And so besides hanging out with your coworkers at the ballpark, what do you do to 
relax after work?  
 
[00:17:07] 
 
BW: 
I like to fish during free time. And then right now, it's baseball season. So, with my 
son almost every day for practice or games after work, so.  
 
VP: 
Is he in the Konkrete Kids team?  
 
BW: 
No, no, he plays for lower Nazareth, he's only seven.  
 
VP: 
That's nice. Have you brought your kids over to the plant?  
 
BW: 
Only in the wash house, can’t really take them through the plant, but we've driven 
through when they had the big cranes here. Stuff like this, he likes the cranes, so.   
10 
 
 
VP: 
How about the museum, the Atlas Cement?  
 
BW: 
No, I haven't been there yet. I do have to get there to check it out.  
 
VP: 
Is there something else that I haven't asked that you might want to comment on?  
 
BW: 
No.  
 
VP: 
Well, thank you so much for your time. It's really nice to learn about what you do.  
 
BW: 
Thank you, I appreciate it.
