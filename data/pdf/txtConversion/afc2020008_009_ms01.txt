Amr El Hakim interviewed by Vyta Pivo on May 25, 2021 at the Lehigh Cement Company 
Plant in Nazareth, Pennsylvania. The interview transcript has been edited for clarity.  
 
[00:00:00] 
 
Vyta Pivo: 
Today is Tuesday, May 25th, 2021. This is an interview for the Occupational 
History Archive, which is part of the Folklife Center at the Library of Congress, funded by 
the Archie Green Fellowship. As part of this project, I am interviewing cement workers in the 
Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania, the birthplace of the modern cement industry and the United 
States. The recording and transcript will become part of the permanent collection at the 
Library of Congress. My name is Vyta Pivo and today I'm speaking with Amr El Hakim at 
the Lehigh Cement Company Nazareth Plant in Nazareth, Pennsylvania. And just to confirm, 
you, give me your permission to record the interview, is that right?  
 
Amr El Hakim: That is correct.  
 
VP: 
Thank you so much. Could you tell me your full name, your year of birth, and where 
you were born?  
 
AEH: OK, my name is Amr El Hakim. I was born in Egypt. And what was the last question?  
 
VP: 
Your year of birth? 
 
AEH: My year of birth is 1984.  
 
VP: 
So where did you grow up?  
 
AEH: I grew up in Egypt. I lived my whole life in Egypt, in Cairo. And I came to the U.S. in 
2013.  
 
VP: 
And did you come here for school or for work?  
 
AEH: I came here because I married my wife. She's a U.S. citizen, so she wanted to move to 
the U.S.  
 
VP: 
And you came to the Lehigh Valley? 
 
AEH: I came, I started work and I spent six months in Florida. And then I spent two years in 
upstate New York in our Lehigh planting Glens Falls. And then I moved to Evansville, which 
is close to the Lehigh Valley, and then finally came here to Nazareth for the last five years.  
 
VP: 
And so, what is your job here at this plant?  
 
[00:01:48] 
 
AEH: My job here at the plant is a project engineer, so I take care of all capital projects.  
 
VP: 
Could you tell me a little bit like when you first learned about cement and concrete?  
 
AEH: Yes. So, my dad is a cement worker. He kind of did cement his whole life. So, I was 
always inspired by my dad to work in the cement industry. And once I graduated as a 
mechanical engineer, I decided to take the same route. I started out as a kiln operator and then 
moved on to do a lot of commissioning work. So, I traveled to a lot of countries in the Middle 
East. I traveled to Libya, Algeria, Syria, commissioned a lot of plants there and worked, 
commissioned a lot of plants in Egypt also.  
 
VP: 
So you have experience working. Did you start working in Egypt in the cement 
industry?  
 
AEH: Yes, this is all in Egypt. I only came to the U.S., like I said, 2013 as a process 
engineer. So, I worked in the production department for about five years. And then I moved 
on here as a project engineer.  
 
VP: 
So. And in school, you studied engineering as well?  
 
AEH: Yes, I'm a mechanical engineer from Cairo University.  
 
VP: 
And did you was your education specialized for the cement industry?  
 
AEH: No, it wasn't.  
 
VP: 
But you had an easier way because your dad was involved?  
 
[00:03:12] 
 
AEH: Yes, I did have an easier way because, but I started from the bottom, which is a kiln 
operator, which is kind of an entry level to cement in in Egypt. As an engineer, you start as a 
kiln operator and then you work your way up.  
 
VP: 
What was involved in doing that work?  
 
AEH: So, I had to run the kiln. I had a, um, a just my responsibility was running the kiln 
section of the plant, which is like the heart of the cement industry is the kiln. So, I was trained 
to be a kiln operator. I was able to run the kiln and moving on from there. 
 
VP: 
What types of, like, what's the actual work? Is it mostly (…)  
 
AEH:  Operator. So, you sit on a computer, you monitor the operation and you make changes 
to make sure the operation is steady. So yeah. So, kiln monitoring. And, yeah, that’s it.  
 
VP: 
Are you involved in maintaining it or is that a different department? 
 
AEH: Production. We were in production, so we're operational. So, making sure the kiln is 
running. So, we had, we'd communicate to the guys on site to make sure, you know, the 
process is working properly.  
 
VP: 
And what kind of other jobs did you have in the industry after you finished working 
with a company?  
[00:04:26] 
 
AEH: I worked as a commissioning engineer. So, I would new cement plants or new portion 
of the cement plant is getting built and I would help in startup and, uh, and achieving 
performance guarantees. And yeah, that's … I did that for like three or four years, yeah.  
 
VP: 
So, through that, you learned all the different parts of the plant.  
 
AEH: Yes. And what it takes to build a plant and get everybody together, the electrical and 
mechanical 
to 
test 
equipment, 
equipment 
testing 
and 
achieving 
guarantees 
and 
troubleshooting good design issues at the beginning and it was very interesting, yeah.  
 
VP: 
And can you talk a little bit about what it was like to work with local people in the 
different locations?  
 
[00:05:15] 
 
AEH: Oh, yeah, absolutely. I mean, we had a lot of different backgrounds. Like, in Egypt, 
it's the workforce is a lot bigger. So, you have a lot of, uh, manpower. And then also, when I 
worked in Libya, they actually had people from India to run the plant. So that was a very 
interesting experience dealing with people from completely … some of them don't even 
speak English and to coordinate between them and try to understand their schedule, their 
mentality. The work ethics was a bit interesting. And then Algeria also, we got people, uh, 
Algerians are also completely different mentalities than Egyptians or Indians, which was 
quite, quite interesting. You know, they have the French mentality a little bit. So, and then 
they don't even speak Arabic or English. They speak French. So, it was a very challenging, 
but it was worthwhile for sure. And it's a beautiful country.  
 
VP: 
Was it difficult to live there as well?  
 
AEH: In Libya, it was like in the middle of a desert, so it was difficult. So, it was like in the 
middle of nowhere. We had our own camp and next to the plant. So, we were just living 
there. Didn't see anybody except the workforce for like six months there. So, it was a very 
harsh environment. But in Algeria, no, I lived in a place called Auron, I think in English. And 
it's a beautiful city right across from Marseilles, France. And it was it was actually called 
petit [Paris]. So, it's a small mimic of Paris. So, it was a beautiful country, was you know, it 
was the middle of town, it was and it was pretty lovely, actually, to live that experience. So, it 
wasn't difficult. But in Egypt, I've lived in, I’ve commissioned plants like in the middle of the 
desert also. It's a pretty harsh environment to live there for a while. So, yeah.  
 
VP: 
How did the local people receive the cement industry as a new kind of employer as a 
new incoming …  
 
AEH: So, in Libya, it was a new industry. So, we were presenting that kind of training to 
people. I can't understand the people. They had a lot of appreciation for the technology and 
they see the results. And the work ethic was pretty interesting to see the feedback from the 
locals. They would appreciate the industry and, uh, the work that we were doing. And in 
Algeria, there was already multiple cement plants there. So, it wasn't something new, but 
there was something they were used to. And they were, uh, you know, they liked the industry 
and they had no problems with it.  
 
VP: 
How did this international experience shape your work here in the Lehigh Valley?   
 
[00:08:17] 
 
AEH: Oh, absolutely because you kind of learn how to deal with different people from 
different backgrounds. So, you kind of know how everybody thinks and you have to adapt to 
their mentalities. And that was pretty easy for me. And people appreciate that about 
personnel, especially when you work in the cement industry where you have to really 
understand the mentality. And when people see that you know, that you can adapt to, uh, to 
their mentality, they really appreciate that. 
 
VP: 
Was it challenging for you to come in as an international person in a very American 
industry that is rooted in this region? 
 
AEH:  So, Evansville and Nazareth was like that, but also Glens Falls. Glens Falls I think is 
the first cement plant, the longest still running plant in the US. So, there's a lot culture there. 
And but people were very nice, do they? Very welcoming. And it wasn't I wouldn't say it was 
very challenging. No, I was it was a good experience overall. I mean, I still have I still talk to 
these people and we had a very good experience. So, no, I wasn't, I didn't see it any very 
challenging. No, it was pretty OK to adapt to it.  
 
VP: 
Could you tell me about the work you do at the plant in your current job?  
 
[00:09:46] 
 
AEH: So, I do a capital project which means new equipment, replace equipment, any project 
above one hundred thousand dollars, I'm responsible to implement that at the plant. So, every 
year we have a budget we replace broken. Or we add new equipment to the plant.  
 
VP: 
So, what does a typical day at work for you look like?  
 
AEH: So, a typical day is … we start by the morning meaning, I get to know a little bit about 
what's going on at the plant. Give me an idea, you know, to help you plan future projects and 
kind of intervene a little bit with the daily day to day stuff. But and then I have my meeting. I 
typically either have a project going on so have contractors on site, I manage them. And at 
the same time, I have some projects that are still starting, maybe reviewing some drawings, 
reviewing engineering drawings. Right. To initial reports about problems that we have so that 
we can get authorization for new projects. And yeah, that's kind of my day depends on where 
I'm at the year or so in the wintertime and how to type. So, this is most my project gets 
implemented. So, I have a lot of contractors on site. I have to supervise them, you know, go 
there in the morning, talk to them and make sure everybody's working safe and following the 
procedures, make sure we're on schedule and then follow up on the schedule. Make sure that 
we're still within the budget and within the time schedule that we originally had. And if 
there's sometimes there's problems with the plan and then we have to sit down and kind of 
come up with solutions of how to get back on schedule.  
 
VP: 
Do you walk around the plant a lot, do you spend a lot of time out? 
 
AEH: Depends, like I said, I spend a lot of time out there and when we have a lot of 
contractors, I would spend most of my time, 90 percent of my time outside, but most 
otherwise I would be mostly in the office preparing for the for the next job coming or the job 
that is already getting started. So, it depends. I would say 50/50 outside and inside.  
 
VP: 
So, would you say your job is more kind of autonomous or do you work as part of the 
team pretty regularly?  
 
AEH: I was part of a team pretty regularly because I kind of try to help everybody else 
because I have a little bit of production experience, a bit of mechanical experience. So, I deal 
with the Maintenance Department a lot, dealing with production and trying to help out 
sometimes outside of my job, but my job, I'm responsible to implement every single aspect of 
it. But I need a lot of people's help. So, I have to interact with a lot of portions of the plant, 
from environmental to safety to maintenance to production. So, every single project affects 
multiple departments. So, I have to really interact with all the departments and get everybody 
on the same page, because if I just focus on my job, my job is not going to be implemented 
properly because my customer is … the plant operation. So, I have to make sure that they are 
involved in the process. And they I meet their demands with every project. So, I really have 
to interact on a day-to-day basis with them.  
 
VP: 
Do you also keep up with kind of new technologies that come out that I can go to?  
 
[00:13:05] 
 
AEH: And yes, yes. Very crucial and important to deal with that from new technologies and 
the cement to also project management skills and changes in the project management skills. 
So, I have to really keep up with that. And I have to … I'm also doing an MBA. So that also 
keeps me a little bit up to date with the with what's going on and I minor in project 
management. So, yeah, and we have seminars, I sit with vendors like two or three times a 
month just to get what's new and will help the plant. I get magazines, I read magazines and 
things like that. So yeah.  
 
VP: 
So, you said you're doing an MBA, so you're getting additional training and that's 
provided, that's paid for by the company?  
 
AEH: Yes, the company pays for that.  
 
VP: 
You can kind of kind of get more kind of like management skills, correct.  
 
AEH: Yeah.  
 
VP: 
It's … do you feel like since you've been in the industry for some time, how has there 
been a shift in kind of a focus on management?  
 
[00:14:15] 
 
AEH: No, I think it's been there for a long time, actually. One of my professors at Lehigh 
University, he used to, uh, do a tailored program, financial program, for Lehigh. So, they had 
a three year program where they teach. He taught it. They have selected group of people from 
the Lehigh Company. They sat there for three months every year and went through a class, a 
three year class every summer, they would say for three months and go through the class. 
And that was like, I don't know, twenty years ago. So, it's always been there. I don't think it's 
a shift. I think it has been there. The education I would say actually in the past, maybe 
probably more rigorously than now. I don't believe there's a lot of a lot of people that think 
about an MBA or a master’s degree now in cement, but I believe we're trying to bring that a 
little bit back. Krzysztof is also doing an MBA. So, we're trying to get that back like it used 
to be. I would say so, yeah.  
 
VP: 
Why do you think that's important?  
 
AEH: I think there is a little bit of separation between plant and top management. I think it 
gives you a lot of perspective of why the top management are thinking the way they're 
thinking. And it gives you understanding of what way is the proper implementation of top 
management strategies. And it helps a lot with, you know, eliminating that confusion of why 
we're doing things.  
 
VP: 
Is it helpful for you to also think about the relationship between labor unions, since 
they are such a big part of the industry?  
 
[00:16:14] 
 
AEH: Absolutely. I mean, it helps me explain what's going on to the to the to the hourly. I 
mean, right now, I'm not very involved as a project engineer with the hourly force, but when I 
was in process and production, I was very much involved with them. And I was always very 
keen on explaining to them why we're doing things that we were doing it now, because if you 
look back 20 years ago, the amount of labor force on site is has been almost cut to half. So, 
they a lot of people struggle a lot with understanding why we're changed, why that changed. 
And it's a lot to do with cost cutting, but also new technologies. So, it's very difficult to have 
them change their ways, especially people with a lot of experience. So, step by step, day by 
day, you get to help them understand the big changes coming their way.  
 
VP: 
Yeah. So, what are some of the big changes and identify some of the things that are 
coming up in the industry that are going to be important?  
 
AEH: Well, it's a very old industry, right? So, it's the only … every company wants to grow. 
Right. And the only way to grow in the cement is to either buy other companies, so it's 
mergers and acquisitions or cutting costs. So, and our companies doing both. So, people have 
to understand that cutting costs is one of the big reasons cement will survive in this country. 
So, we have, this is this is a daily challenge that we go through. And sometimes cutting costs 
means you have to spend more money, but we have to as management, this is a bit of a 
challenge to make those decisions on what needs to be cut costs, but sometimes where to 
spend the money also.  
 
VP: 
Also, what would you say is the most challenging part of your job?  
 
AEH: The most challenging part of my job. I mean, I think it's getting people together on the 
same page because, like I said, I deal with different stakeholders, like, you know, getting 
maintenance, electrical and production and hourly to work together to achieve a job. And 
that's something I enjoy, but it's some days it can be pretty challenging. You have to 
understand how people think and what they go through on their own, because everybody's 
busy, everybody's overwhelmed. And once you understand that about their daily job, it's you 
can, if they feel you understand they're there, what they go through, they will take the extra 
step to help you out.  
 
VP: 
Are there kind of particular challenges with personnel that you're talking about, or, 
because of the long hours, long shifts?  
 
[00:19:22] 
 
AEH: Yeah, it is. There's long hours, long shifts, and people are overwhelmed because we're 
short of people, but the people can sometimes get frustrated with and you have to know when 
to ask for a job and when to, you know, who to approach and how to approach it. It is very 
challenging from that perspective for sure, because everybody's overwhelmed, like I said.  
 
VP: 
And how about the best part of your job?  
 
AEH: The best part of my job is, you know, seeing the impact of a project completed that 
helps the plant, you know. If I see a problem that's happening every day and people are fed 
up with it and tired of it and work on a project, fix the problem and the problem goes away, 
that's just the best part of my job. And yeah, I enjoy it a lot.  
 
VP: 
How long does it take to complete a project with lots of things? What’s the range? 
 
AEH: It depends on the project: some projects take two years, some projects take three 
months. So, it's we do a lot of different types of projects, you know, from small, you know, 
easy, easy projects to [unclear] with quick implementation within two or three months to long 
term projects that could take two or three years.  
 
VP: 
Are there any particular favorites that you have that you're excited about a particular 
project?  
 
[00:20:50] 
 
AEH: Yeah, I'm working on a on a project to transport the spray tower dust to the silo. So, 
every day the dust from the spray tower gets dumped on the floor and the loader operator has 
to do maybe 100 buckets a shift. So, I'm working on getting that dust transferred 
automatically to the silo and give time for the operator to do something else. So, that's 
exciting. And I feel that this will help the loader operator and also help dust emission from 
the plant. So, that's a very important project for me and dear to my heart.  
 
VP: 
How regularly do you do this project, this particular one?  
 
AEH: This particular one. Well, this particular one is, I mean, everyone project is different, 
there are no projects that are the same. Everybody has different objectives and different 
criteria. So, there are a lot of projects that, all my projects have an impact on the plant and 
that's the beauty of my project. So yeah, I didn't do a project that is similar to another project. 
Every project is different. 
VP: 
But removing the dust seems like something you would do regularly.  
 
AEH: Oh, how did as long as the kill is running, dust is dumping on the floor.  
 
VP: 
Is he removing it every day? Or every week? 
 
AEH: Every day. Like I said, 100, 100, 150 times a shift, 150 buckets a shift.  
 
VP: 
Is there an especially memorable project that you were really proud?   
 
[00:22:16] 
 
AEH: Especially memorable. Yeah, there was a project here. I mean, it's more cost with the 
bucket elevator. We were we were having two or three times it was feel it's a big, big bucket 
elevator. It's like one hundred and fifty feet tall. And it's like in the heart of the cement plant, 
the transport, the material. And we that year we kept failing, that bucket kept failing two or 
three times a month. And every time it fails, we have to get a contractor, pay thousands of 
dollars just to repair it and had to put a plan together to get to get a replacement done within 
three months. We got that. Take the whole thing out, put a new one in. And, uh, the plan was 
up and running and never didn't take us down for it for a while. So, it was pretty quick and 
challenging project, but I'm proud of it. I see it every day coming into work. Look at it and 
see I did that.  
 
VP: 
What was involved in the process? 
 
AEH: Trying to get an understanding of what is the problem is pretty challenging, because 
when things are failing, everybody is just rushing and trying to just fix it, just fix it. But I had 
to slow everybody down. So, I kind of let's try to understand what is the issue. Do a little 
history on the failures and trying to get people together to sit down and understand the root 
causes of the problem and then get defenders and trying to do the proper engineering and that 
with the very short time limit is pretty challenging to do so. Yeah, that was, uh, pretty 
difficult. 
 
VP: 
Because some of these problems seem complicated or there’s not necessarily one 
source, so it sort of takes both knowledge of the technology, but also some intuition to know. 
Do you feel like that's a component of your job where you sort of have to use your 
knowledge but also just have a kind of feeling for some of these technologies?  
 
AEH: Well, experience and I think you cannot just rely on your knowledge that there would 
be a mistake. If I do that, I think you got to get everybody, because there is a lot of 
experience in the plant that you can utilize and see from the history of the interaction with it. 
But you also have to involve, you know, engineers and consultants and, you know, our 
technology center. You know, people get a lot of stakeholders together to focus on the 
problem and come up with a solution. That's how I like to do it. And that's kind of project 
management is getting people together. It's not relying on you, it's not about your experience. 
I have some experience. I can do some judgments just and I use it just to do the proper 
selection of stakeholders to make sure they come up with the right solution.  
 
VP: 
And so how about the kind of the culture of working here, like do people gather 
together? Is there a kind of community of cement workers?  
 
 
[00:25:18] 
AEH: Yeah, I think people are very close here together. The, uh, the management especially 
that they're very close together. And I think a lot of our management team come from the 
hourly side also. So, there is a lot of interaction between management and hourly. So, yeah, I 
believe you mean people go out every week to play golf together and. Yeah, yeah. It's just 
pretty close, tight community and Nazareth's especially it's, everybody knows the Nazareth 
plant. The cement plant is kind of everybody in town has at one point in his life was impacted 
by the plant and has a relative or a brother or a father that work there. So, yeah.  
 
VP: 
Do you do you have friends who are kind of in the industry as well?  
 
AEH: I mean, I came from outside, so all my friends in the industry came from working in 
the industry. I did not have prior friends from the industry, I would say so. Because I'm from 
Egypt, like I told you, yeah.   
 
VP: 
So, you and your coworkers didn't hang out after work. Do you go play golf with 
them now?  
 
AEH: Yeah, I sometimes go out, but I live a pretty busy life with the MBA and the kids. 
And also it's very difficult when I get a chance. Yeah. We go out sometime.  
 
VP: 
Do you talk about cement at all?  
 
AEH: Oh no, no we keep that in the plant, we don’t talk about cement.  
 
VP: 
What do you do to relax when you’re not working here?   
 
AEH: What to do I kitesurfing. So, I uh that's my hobby. I like to go surfing. It's very 
difficult to find the time to do it. But when I find time I go travel and do that.  
 
VP: 
That's awesome.  
 
AEH: Yeah.  
 
VP: 
So, in closing this interview, is there something that you'd like to say that we that we 
haven't talked about or is there a question that I haven't asked that would be important for you 
to mention?  
 
AEH: Uh, that would be. Um, not really. I think you covered everything,  
 
VP: 
So, thank you so much for your time.  
 
AEH: Yep. Thank you.
