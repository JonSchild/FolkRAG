watched her up the stairs, 
Where we to supper went, 
Upon those tassels on the boms, 
My soul was so intent; 
They asked me to propose a

Said 1 
here's one that suits, 
So fill your glasses up and drink, 
To the tassels on the boots.

Of very bitter -

"Oh no," I

3 I 
met shooting stars who were bent upon sport, 
But who " shot" in a 
very strange manner I 
thought; 
And one thing beat all by chalks I 
must say, 
That was when I 
got into the Milky Way; 
I 
counted the stars, till at last I 
thought, 
I'd found out how much they were worth by the quart, 
Au unpolite "Aerolite" who ran 'gainst my car, 
Wouldn't give "e'er a 
light," to light my cigar. _ Whilst up, tte. 
4 Next a 
comet went by 'midst fire like hail, 
To give me a 
lift, I 
seized hold of his tail, 
To where he was going I 
didn't enquire, 
We'd gone past the moon, till we couldn't get higher; 
Yes, we'd got to the furthermost I 
I 
don't think I 
joke, 
When somehow I 
felt a 
great shock—I 
awoke 
When instead of balloon, moon and planets, I 
saw, 
I'd tumbled from off of my bed to the floor. 
orus.—And there was no balloon,—there was no balloon, 
There were not any planets, and there wasn't any moon, 
So never sup too heavy, or by jingo very soon, 
You're like to fancy you are going up in a 
balloon.

CAPTAIN *TIMM OF THE HORSE MARINES. 
As 
sung by the GREAT LINGARD. 
I 
am Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines, 
I 
of-ten live beyond my means, 
I 
sport young ladies in their teens, 
To cut a 
swell in the army. 
I 
teach the La-dies how to dance, 
How to dance, how to dance, 
I 
teach the La-dies how to dance, 
For I'm their pet in the army. 
SPOKEN.-11a! ha! ha! 
CHORUS. 
I'm Cap-Lain Jinks of the Horse Marilies, 
I 
give my horse good corn and beans ; 
Of course its quite beyond my moans, 
Tho' a 
Captain in the ar-my. • 
I 
joined my corps when twenty-one, 
Of coarse I 
thought it capital fun. 
When the enemy came then off I 
run, 
I 
was'nt cut out for the army, 
When I 
left home mama she cried, 
Mama she cried, mama she cried, 
When I 
left home mama she cried, 
" 
He aiut cut out for the army." 
SPOKEN—N-1, she thought I 
was too young, but then, ) said, 
ah! mama, 
I'm Captain Jinks of the Horse Muines, 
The first day I 
went out to drill, 
The bugle sound made me quite ill, 
At the Balance step my hat it fell, 
And that wouldn't do for the army. 
The officers they all did shout. 
They all cried out, they all did shout, 
The officers they all did shout, 
" 
Oh that's the curse of the army." 
SPoKEN.—Of course my hat did fall off, but ah 
nevertliPless, 
I'm Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines,,k4z. 
My Tailor's bills came in so fast, 
Forced me one day to leave at last.. 
ITALIAN GUINEA PIG BOY. 
And ladies too no more did cast, 
Sheep's eyes at me in the army. 
My creditors at me did shout, 
At me did shout, at me did shout, 
My creditors at me did shout, 
" 
Why kick him out of the army." 
SPOEN—I 
said, alt! gentlemen, ah! kick me out of the army ? 
Perhaps you are not aware, that, 
I'm Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines, &c. 
ITALIAN GUINEA PIG )0Y. 
As sung by the GREAT LINGARD. 
I'm a 
poor Italian Guinea pig boy, 
Straight from Florence I

My parents say, " Joseph, what for you roam," 
And. mine little sister cry, when I. leavee my home.

PVLLING HARD AGAINST THE STREAM. 
[CONCLUDED.] 
Many a 
bright, good-hearted fellow, 
Many a 
noble-minded man, 
Finds himself in water shallow ; 
Then, assist him, if you can. 
Some succeed at every turning, 
Fortune favors every , elleme, 
Others, too—tho' more deserving, 
have to pull against the stream. 
So then, do your best, &c. 
If the wind is in your favor, 
And you've weathered every squall, 
Think of those who luckless labor, 
Never get fair winds at all: 
'Working hard, contented, willing, 
Struggling thro' life's ocean wide; 
Not a 
friend, and not a 
shilling, 
Pulling hard against the tide. 
So then, do your best, &c. 
Don't give way to foolish sorrow, 
Let this keep von in good cheer; 
Brighter days may come to-morrow, 
Tf„you try and persevere; 
Darkest nights will have a 
morning, 
Tho' the sky be overcast; 
tonc.res4- lanes must have a 
turning, 
And the tide will turn at last. 
So then, do your best,

ON THE BEACH AT LONG EL. reCH. 
As sung by the GREAT LINGARD. 
On the Beach at Long Branch, one fine Summer's day, 
I 
had a 
novel reading to pass the time away, 
And so interested was I 
in the plot— 
A Gent stood there bedside me—still I 
saw him not— 
at last, by chance, my eyelids I 
did raise--
I 
found him on me looking with enraptured. gaze— 
Bright blue eyes so sparkling, handsome Grecian nose, 
Teeth of pearly whiteness—quite the pink of beaux. 
Twas on the beach at Long Branch, one fine Summer's day, 
I 
met this handsome man who stole my heart away; 
Now I 
feel so happy as blissful moments glide, 
The day is quickly coming when I 
shall be his bride! 
-As like one awaking from some happy dream, 
'We glances did exchange—his eyes with love did. beam— 
Ere much time was over, we began to chat— 
And hours passed away—still he beside me sat— 
And with ways so winning he did. love impart— 
My spirits rose as high as the early morning lark. 
He told Inc that he loved me, vowed that an his life 
Would ho to him worthless, unless I'd be his wife. 
'Tw,as on the beach, &c. 
He said, that if I'd marry, all troubles we would drown, 
Ana live in blissful ignoranee of all the cares of Town. 
With soft persuasive power he told me of his love, 
Vowing to be true, by all the Powers above ! 
Ile asked me if I'd. marry, pressed me then to say— 
Till, to his wishes yielding, I 
named the happy day. 
He said his cup of bliss was filled quite to the brim, 
He'd live alone for me, and I 
alone for him I . 
Spoken.— And I en assure you, Ladies and Gentlemen, he 
Is one of those dear deliglaul fellows that no young girl could 
resist, and I'm very happy and. proud to say: Up to the pres-
ent moment I've no oikase to regret that

OLD HATS AND RAGS. 
As sung by the GREAT LINGARD. 
Ord hats! old rags! my trouble is great, 
Could I 
be in a 
more wretched state, 
I 
feel indeed my heart it will break; 
List, and I 
will tell you of my wrongs, 
hark and I 
will my woes unfold; 
By a 
girl I 
have been cruelly sold, 
And through her I've lost all my nice gala, 
My heart and my gold is both gone. 
cnc:aus 
Old hats, old rags, my cry is old rags: . 
This bag on my back, the streets I 
drag, 
And Ruth, mine Ruth, I 
did love her so, 
But Slotchzein, I 
find I've been sold. 
Sha lived down an area in Union Square, 
And every day I 
did pass me by there, • 
She was possess'd of beauty most rare, 
And one day she beckoned me to come, 
She had some old hats to exchange for nem 
She incited the heart of this poor Jew, 
And how I 
loved her! A 
h, just a 
few, 
But Slotchzein, I 
find I've been sold. 
Old. hats, old rags, az. 
I 
used to call on her most every day, 
Down on my knees I 
implored her to say 
She'd be my dear wife and not to say nay, 
And then she agreed to be mine ; 
But, oh my heart, I 
must have been cream, 
For in my old coat I 
opened a 
scam, 
And gave ten dollar to my heart's queen, 
To buy her some things for the time. 
Old hats, old rags, &c. 
She said, Now, dear Slotchzein, soon you'll.be mine, 
Drink my good health in a 
glass of old wine, 
It must have been poisonA, for I 
slept such a 
time, 
Which she turned it to profit it seems; 
For when I 
awoke, I 
thought I 
must choke, 
I 
was tied by the arras and legs with a 
rope, 
And Ruth had hooked it with mine coat, 
With a 
thousand dollars sewed in the seam. 
Old hats, old rags, Sat. 
BITTER BEER. 
As sung by the GREAT LINGARD 
The subject of my little song, 
Is one I 
hold most dear, 
It supports our Constitution, 
And it will for many a 
year; 
John il-111 would surely be defunct, 
Or 
ne look rather queer, 
If Bass & Co. should cease to brew 
Their glorious " Bitter Beer."' 
CHORUS. 
Allsop, Bass & Uo., they each deserve a monument, so give 
them whib we're here, 
Three cheers for 3ass and Allsop, and their glorious " Bitter 
Beer." 
I've tasted " Hock " and Claret too, 
Madeira and Moselle, 
Not one of those boshy wines 
Revives this languid swell; 
Of all complaints from " A 
to Z," 
The fact is very clear, 
There's no disease but what's been cured 
'Py- 
Bass's " Bitter Beer." 
Allsop, Bass & Co., &c. 
I've lived in Scotland many years, 
And drank its mountain dew, 
I 
don't deny but what it's good, 
And a 
stimulant, it's true. 
I'm far from being prejudiced, 
As many think, I 
fear, 
But give to me a 
cooling draught, 
Of Bass's " Bitter Beer." 
Allsop, Bass & Co., &c., 
*Pronounced " Bit tali Bee-ah."

My life beats the couple to smash, 
You can get a

That is if you've got but the cash;

And afterwards left me a " plum."

THE GRECIAN BEND. 
As sung by the GREAT LINGARD. 
Good evening to you one and all, 
I 
hope I 
don't intrude, 
Dressed in this quiet fashion, 
Pray do not think me rude. 
I 
always study " Le Follet," 
The fashion to amend; 
So I 
introduce you, ladies, too, 
This graceful Grecian Bend. 
CHORUS. 
The Grecian Bend, as I 
now show, 
You must admit is all the go. 
The head well forward, and the body you extend, 
To be perfect in the Grecian Bend. 
'Twos raining hard the other day, 
So I 
got into a 
stage, 
Some little boys began to shout, 
Which put me in a 
rage. 
The driver, too, said, " Really, Miss, 
You've room enough for ten," 
And actually charged me double, 
On account of my Grecian Bend. 
SPOKEN 
wouldn't mind it so much only there was Ann 
Jenkins, who lives next door to me, in the same stage, she began 
to laugh at me, she's been practicing the Grecian Bend for 
three weeks, but she can't do it, she's jealous of me because I 
took her young man away. 
One gent had the audacity to tell 
me that the Greei n Bend was nothing more or less than a 
spasmodic movement of the third rib in connection with the 
left shoulder. 
In fact I 
need not tell you that—

NOT FOR JOSEPH. 
I've seen a 
bit of gaiety throughout my short career, 
once, was foolish with my tin, but I've paid most dear, 
if folks would seek to take me in, they find it is no go; 
I'm up to almost every thing: You can't get over Joe. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! dear, no 1 
not for Joe—if he knows it—not for Joseph. 
Oh! no, no! not for Joe—not for Joseph—oh I 
dear, no I 
The other day, I-met a 
friend, we passed the time of day, 
And chatted gaily down Broadway: but ere T 
went away, 
I 
kindly asked the learned swell to take a 
parting drain, 
Oh! yes, said he, I 
think I 
will: then let it be champagne. 
Spoken.—No, you don't, my dear fellow, you don't get 
champagne out of Joseph. 
Oh I 
dear, no, not 1 &c. 
Some time ago, a 
friend of mine, he asked me out to dine, 
And there he introduced me to one be called divine: 
He said she'd make a 
charming wife, and had such lots of tin: 
A widow only forty-two: go in, my boy, and win. 
Spoken.—Matrimony and lots of money, and a 
widow only 
forty-two----well, the money is very good, but then—the widow. 
Oh I 
dear, no, not 1 &c. 
Of late, in town, there was a 
fuss about the Japs so grand: 
And, also, of the Russians who visited our land, 
And the country-companies we greeted with hearty cheers, 
We know they have been received well by the New York 
Volunteers. 
Spoken.--What a 
glorious thing it is to fight and die for 
your country I What can be more glorious than a 
bullet in 
your eye ? 
What can be more painful than a 
bullet in the 
eye ? 
Nothing I 
should think— 
Oh 1 
dear, no, not! &c. 
And now, perhaps, I've snug my song, you might be in the 
cue, 
To show you kind acknowledgement, but that with me won't 
do, 
As for to-night rye done my best, and that you ought to know: 
So, if you want a 
song again, don't try it on with Joe I 
Oh! dear, no, not! &c,

She's bare-footed and pretty, she's lively and witty, 
She sings her wild songs to the murmuring sea, 
She'll dance on the sand where the fisherman stands, 
And loin in the music of a 
wild swelling glee. 
She sits in her boat and sings o'er th billow, 
And flirts with the spray like a 
sea skimming gull ; 
She laughs at the winds whose revels are music, 
And beats to the time with the stroke of her scull— Clio.

The bells they shall ring, and the sa:lors shall sing 
V- heave ho, y-heave ho, boys, for time's on the wing, 
To see pretty Sarah, the pride of the sea, 
Who's going to be married next Sunday to me; 
Her hair I 
will deck with a 
wreath of bright sea weed 
I'll plant in her bosom a 
blooming moss rose : 
She shall go like a 
lay with sweet tinkling music ; 
With rings on her fingers a::.1 bells ea her toes.-- Cho.

THE FLYING TRAPEZE. 
Once I 
wts happy, but now I'm forlorn, 
Like an old coat that is tattered and torn, 
Left in this wide world to fret and to mourn— 
Betrayed by a 
maid in her teens. 
The girl that I 
loved, she was handsome— 
I 
tried all I 
knew her to please; 
But I 
could not please her one quarter so well 
Like that man upon the Trapeze. 
CTIOliTJS. 
He'd fly through the air with the greatest of ease, 
A daring young man on the flying Trapeze— 
His movements were graceful: all girls he could please, 
And my love he purloined away. 
This young man by name was Signor Bona Slang; 
Tall, big and handsome, as well made as Chang; 
Where'er he appeared, the hail loudly rang— 
With ovation from all people there. 
He'd smile from the bar on the people below; 
And, one night, he smiled on my love, 
She winked back at him, and he shouted: Bravo 
As he hung by his nose up above. [Cllonus. 
Her father and mother were both on my side, 
And very hard tried to make her my own bride. 
Her father he sighed, and her mother she cried, 
To see her throw herself away. 
'Twas all no avail: she went there every night,' 
And, would throw him bouquets on the stage, 
Which caused him to meet her : how he rim me dnwn, 
To tell you would take a 
whole page. [Citonus. 
One night, I, as usual, went to her dear home, 
Found there her mother and father alone; 
I 
asked for my love: and soon they made known, 
To my horror, that she'd run away ! 
She'd packed up her box and eloped, in the night, 
With him, with the greatest of ease 
Front two stories high, he had lowered her down, 
To the ground on his flying Trapeze 
LCnoutls. 
Some months after this, I 
went to a 
Nall, 
Was greatly surprised to see, on the wall, 
A 
bill in red letters, which did my heart gall, 
That he was appearing with him I

you've no idea the run of luck, 
Which I 
have found the rule, 
Attends you if you go in " hot," 
Of course remaining " cool," 
A 
purse is just in case of need, 
For you can ride rough shod, 
And live like any fighting cock, 
If you're oti)in "

A friend of mine three daughters had, 
He asked me home to tea,

play'd and sung when by and bye, 
They all spoon'd on to me.

WALKING IN THE ZOO. 
Air :—" Walking Down Broadway." 
The Stilton, sir, the cheese, the 0. K. thing to do, 
On Sunday afternoon, is to toddle in the Zoo, 
Week days may do for Cads, but not for me and you, 
So dress'd right down the road, we show them who is who. 
CHORUS. 
The walking in the Zoo, walking in the Zoo, 
The 0. K thing on Sunday is the walking in the Zoo, 
Walking in the Zoo, walking in the Zoo, 
The 0. K. thing on Sunday is the walking in the Zoo. 
So when there came to town, my pretty cousin Loo, 
I 
took her off to spend a 
Sunday at the Zoo. 
I 
show'd her the aquarium, the Tiger, the Zebu, 
The Elephant, the Eland, that cuss the Kangaroo. 
CHORUS. 
That Sunday in the Zoo, that Sunday in the Zoo, 
It's jolly with a 
pretT girl walking in the Zoo, 
Walking in the Zoo, walking in the Zoo, 
The 0. K. thing on Sunday is the walking in the Zoo. 
I 
show'd her the sw,Allesses, and all the fashions new, 
Girls with golden locks, girls with black hair too, 
(Walnut gives the black, champagne the golden hue) 
All the beautiful for ever that Madame Rachel knew. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! the walking in the Zoo, walking in the Zoo, 
The mon ; eys put us to the blush on Sunday at the Zoo, 
Walking in the Zoo, walking in the Zoo, 
The U. K. thing on Sunday is the walking in the Zoo. 
So in the monkey house our going in to woo, 
Piling up the agony, swearing to be true, 
krony indeed for the cheerful Cockatoo, 
Caught my ear a 
nip and bit it through and through. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! that cheerful Cockatoo, that awful Cockatoo, 
The horror and the agony that Sunday at the Zoo, 
UPON DIY SAMED HONOR. 
Walking in the Zoo, walking in the Zoo, 
The 0. K. thing on Sunday is the walking in the Zoo. 
My cousin bolted off without any more ado, 
And I 
skedaddled also, looking very blue, 
So sympathising friends I 
bid you all adieu, 
(It's a 
secret, mind, so don't pretend you know.) 
CHORUS. 
If you meet me at the Zoo, you meet me at the Zoo, 
I'm as great a 
swell as ever on Sunday at the Zoo, 
Walking in the Zoo, walking in the Zoo, 
The 0. K. thing on Sunday is walking in the Zoo. 
UPON MY SACWED HONOR. 
A s 
sung by the GREAT LINGARD. 
I 
am wealy a 
lovely swell, but that I 
need net tell, 
For by my cut you see right well, and my name it is young 
Bonner, 
I'm the favorite of the fair and by me they always swear, 
They say I've such a 
finished air, upon my saewed. honor. 
CHORUS. 
My polish'd manners, form complete, 
My rival with me can't compete, 
Upon my sacwed honor. 
Oh! I 
know I'm a 
dashing beau, with the ladies I'm all the go, 
The gentlemen envy me I 
know, the ladies' favorite Bonner, 
As I 
walk along the stweet, the ladies I'm sure to meet, 
To see me is to them a 
tweat, upon my sacwed honor. 
My polish'd, er.e. 
They love my whiskers fine. I 
smile to make them mine, 
I 
kiss them all one at a 
time, they can't wesist young Bonner, 
Yet some have wocls in pickle, they say I'm werry fickle, 
Yet they can't wesist my pleasant tickle, upon my sacwed 
honor. 
My polish'd,

THE UPPER TEN. 
Written, Composed and Sung by W. II. Lisomen,, 
Like famous Jack Brag, that dashing blade, 
Who lived in be-gone days, 
Disgusted with my father's trade, 
Myself I 
sought to raise 
high in this fashionable world; 
So when my father died, then 
I 
spent the cash I'd earned by work, 
Amongst the upper ten. 
Spoken—Yes, the gov'nor kept an oil and color store in 
Fulton street, but, of course, I 
never talked shop— 
CHORUS. 
When I 
belonged, to the upper ten, 
The upper ten, the upper ten, 
Such handsome women and jolly men, 
We swells of the upper ten thousand. 
My style of dress, as you may see! 
Is always quite correct, 
Park loungers stop to look at me, 
My costume to inspect; 
" 
Whose that man's tailor ?" I 
oft hear 
Remarked by envious men; 
ThPy took me for " ten thousand a 
year" 
Amongst the upper ten. 
When I 
belonged, &e. 
Bat running short of cash I 
tried 
My fortune to recruit, 
By looking round me for a 
wife, 
And soon found one to suit; 
THE UPPER TEN.—[coNcLuDED.] 
A lovely young Fifth Avenue belle, 
Rich, idolized by men, 
Oh, lucky chance by which I 
fell 
Amongst the upper ten. 
And she belonged, lte 
She spoke about my family, 
'Twas rather awkward ground, 
For in Debrett my pedigree, 
Can not be be plainly found; 
But told her mine was Norman blood, 
And satisfied, she then 
Said she'd be mine, and with me shine 
Amongst the upper ten. 
And we both belonged, &e. 
One day, as we both down Broadway strolled, 
By chance I 
met a 
friend, 
Who'd known me and my dad of old, 
his hand lie did extend. 
"How's business, what's the price of oils ?" 
He shouted out, and then 
I 
felt it was all up with me, 
Amongst the upper ten. 
4i)oken —It ruined me; and you should have seen her, as, 
she looked into my face, her eyes flashing fire,and all that sort 
of thing, she said— 
I 
thought you belonged, &c.

THE BELL GOES A RINGING FOR SAI-RAH. 
W RITTEN and COMPOSED by C. W. Htncr • 
If you please, you see I'm a 
domestic, 
Or what some would call 'servant gal; 
My raissis she calls me Sairah, 
But father for short calls me " Sal;" 
I'm general slave round the corner, 
My wages a 
hundred a 
year; 
I'm slaving from morning till midnight, 
And I 
finds my own sugar and beer.. 
SPOITEN—And if I 
only sits down a 
minute to take breath, 
CHORUS 
The bell goes a 
ringing for Sairaii, 
Sairah, Sairah. 
The bell goes a ringing for Sairah, 
From morning until night. 
My master's, a 
clerk in the City, 
At a 
thousand dollars a 
year: 
They comes out like a 
Dook and a 
Duchess, 
How they does it to some's not quite clear; 
They give parties and hold up their heads, 
As though they was first of the land; 
Sometimes I've to wait for my wages, 
Whilst they get a 
doing the Grand. 
SPOKEN.—But people as do the Grand very often " Do " 
sombody else at the same time, the Butcher's ask'd for his bill 
for the last six months and if Me hears me a 
talking to him 
01 you should hear, 
The bell go, & c. 
My Missis talks of her c,mnection, 
Says her Grandfather's Pa was a 
Judge; 
Lady Muff and Lord Puff are her cousins, 
THE BELL GOES A. 
RINGING, &o. 
[CONCLUDED.] 
But 'tween us and the bed-post its " fudge," 
She says her blood's " Haristocratic," 
(About that I 
can't speak to be sure,) 
But folks for their money come knocking: 
And vow they won't come any more. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, first I've to go to the door, then I've to go up 
four pair to make the beds, and of course, just as I'm in the 
middle of 'era— 
The bell goes, &c. 
There's but one day I've five minutes quiet, 
That's Sunday, for then, when I 
can, 
I 
goes out after tea for an hour, 
And 'scorted by my young man; 
You must know, if you please, he's a 
sojer, 
And he vows he's entirely mine: 
I 
often wish there was four Sundays a 
week, 
For I 
has to be in at nine. 
Sl'OKEN.—Yes, and if I 
don't shew myself as the c'ock 
strikes, 0! 
The bell goes, ctc. 
I'm lady's-maid, housemaid and cook, 
I 
de everything, honor, no joking, 
I 
scarcely have time to draw breath, 
For she'll ring if the fire wants poking. 
With a 
book out of " Mudie's," she'll loll, 
On the couch in an indolent manner; 
Or else for a 
change she'll sit down, 
And thump away on the Planner. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, we've got a 
Planner, it's a " Broadwood;" 
'tisn't paid for, I 
wonder it hasn't been " Collard and Collard" 
before this: but I 
must be off, for if she fancies I'm here 
u 
talking to you--
The bell will go, cke.

THE RUSTIC YOUNG BEAUTY. 
A IR— Poly Perking. 
IF 
you'll list I 
will sing you a 
S 
0 N 
G, song, 
It's not very short nor L 0 N 
G. long, 
It's about a 
young damsel named F A N, Fan, 
And her LOVIER a 
very nice young NI A N, man. 
Spoken.—The damsel was 
CI10111,1S. 
A 
rustic young beauty as fresh and as fair, 
As the daisies and buttercups that grow in the air. 
She was milking the cow one fine D A 
Y, day, 
When the Squire's youngest son passed that W A Y 
way, 
And he asked this young damsel her N A 
NI, nani ,., 
For his bosom was all in aF L AM, flame, 
Spoken.—With this delightful, this 
Rustic young beauty, &c. 
Fan blushed and she hung her II E D, head, 
When the gallant to her these words S E D, said, 
Says he you're the fairest I've C E 
N, seen, 
Oh say will you be my Q 
1.1 W N, queen ? 
Spoken. — Such an unlooked-for offer quite astonished. 
This rustic young beauty, &c. 
Says he you shall lilve all your K 0 W S, cows, 
And live in a 
very tine H 0 NV 5, house, 
With servants in livery at, your A N D, hand, 
And you shall dress in a 
style quite CI B N D, grand. 
Spoken.— And then he winked at this 
Rustic young beauty, &c. 
To his pa for consent he did then G 
0, go, 
But his pa in a 
rage answered K N 0, no. 
If you wed that there gal ' twill 13 ,t 
S Y N 
N, sin. 
And you shan't have one cent of my 
Y N N; tin. 
Spoken.— This quite destroyed the hopes of this 
Rustic young beauty, &c. 
When this news unto Fan he did T E 
L, tell, 
She threw herself right down a 
W E 
14, well, 
Then the LoVIER cut his jugler with a 
S

R, saw, 
That's the end, so I 
can't tell you 31 0 R, more, 
Spoken.— About this 
Rustic young beauty, &c.

A

THE BIG SUN-FLOWER. 
There is a 
charm I 
can't explain 
About a 
girl I've seen, 
And my heart beats fast when she goes past 
In a 
dark dress trimmed with green. 
Her eyes are bright as evening stars, 
So lovely and so shy, 
And the folks all stop and look around 
Whenever she goes by. 
CHORUS. 
And I 
feel just as happy as a 
big Suit-flower 
That nods and bends in the breezes, 
And my heart is as light as the wind that blows 
The leaves from off the treeses. 
As time passed on and we became 
Like friends of olden time, 
I 
thought the question I 
v;ould pop 
And ask her to be mine. 
But the answer I 
received next day, 
flow could she treat me so, 
For instead of being mine for life, 
She simply answered No! 
And I 
feel, &o. 
I 
called next day dressed in my best, 
My fair one for to see, 
And asked her if she would explain 
Why she had jilted me. 
She said she really felt quite sad, 
To cause me such distress, 
And when I 
said, now do be mine, 
Why of course she answered, yes. 
And I

THE CAPTAIN AL"D HIS WHISYLERS. 
Words and Music by T. II. 13.irLy. 
As they marched Virough the town, with their banners so gay. 
I 
ran to the window to hear the band play; 
I 
peeped through 
the blinds very cautiously then, 
Let the neighbors should say I 
was looking at the men. 
Oh I 
heard the drums beat, and the music so sweet, 
But my eyes at the time caught a 
much greater treat, 
Tile troop was the finest that I 
ever did see, 
And the Captain with his whiskers took a 
sly glance at me. 
When we met at the ball I 
of course thought it right, 
To pretend that we never had met till that night; 
But he knew me at once I 
perceived by his glance, 
And I 
hung down my head when he asked me to dance; 
Oh I 
he sat by my side at the end of the set, 
Ani the sweet words he said I 
never shall forget; 
My heart was enlisted and could not get free, 
As the Captain with his whiskegs took a 
sly glance at me. 
But he marched from the town and I 
saw him no more, 
Yet I 
think of him still and the. whiskers be wore; 
I 
dream all the night, and I 
talk all the day, 
Of the love of a 
Captain who has gone far away; 
I 
remember with superabundant deIzlit, 
When we met in the street aud we danced all the night; 
And I 
keep in my mind how my heart jumped with glee, 
As the Captain with his whiskers took a 
sly glance at me.

When first we met I 
soon could see, 
That with his chance 'twas all U. P. 
And so I 
asked her if she'd have me, 
This beautiful Lancashire Lass. 
My Lancashire Lass, &a 
She said " she'd be mine" and she swore to be true 
We've since been like doves, billing and cooing! 
We never fall out as some lovers do, 
And she has some money, betwixt me and you; 
She bought this watch which now I 
wear, 
If she don't mind, well I 
don't care, 
She says " that her fortune I 
shall share;" 
My beautiful Lancashire Lass. 
My Lancashire Lass, ckte. 
She's published the banns, were going to be wed. 
I leave those matters for her to settle, 
To-morrow, for time so quickly has fled, 
The Lancashire Lass to the church will be led; 
I 
need not work whilst there's a 
purse, 
To the idea I'm not averse, 
And p'rhaps one day I 
may have to nurse, 
A 
sweet little Lancashire Lass.

CHICKABIDDY; OR, GOOD-BYE, JOHN. 
'Twas on a 
Friday morning I— 
Bid New York town, good bye. 
The wind it blow d 
great guns, my boys. 
And the waters ran sky high, 
As I 
waved my new bandana to 
My Nancy on the shore, 
She scbb d 
and sigh'd, and wept and cried— 
When I 
sailed for Singapore. 
Spoken — Aye, lads, and weepingly she cried, 
C110ItliS. 
Good bye. John, now don't stop long, 
But come back soon to your own Chiekahiddy, 
For my heart beats so, when the winds do blow 
That takes away my sailor. 
Sweet Nancy was a 
lass, my boys, 
Of fifteen stone full weight. 
Her face—it was a 
face, my boys, 
Like a 
good sized dinner plate; 
She kept a 
candy-shop, my boys, 
'Twould your eyes do good to see, 
Sold lollypops, and Tom Thumb's drops, 
But nought so sweet as she. 
Spoken,—And her last words were 
Good bye, John, &c. 
When I 
sail d 
for foreign parts I'd bring, 
Back presents to my love, 
Such as Injin hats and Turkish mats, 
Or a 
Chinese turtle dove ; 
Sweet Nance would write me billet doos, 
Which took away my breath, 
And said as how she " by d 
he John, 
With kind tegareLs till death"—so 
CHICKABIDDY -[ CONCLUDED 
Spoken.—And at the bottom of the billey she used to 
put P. S. 
Good bye, John, &e. 
One night I 
had a 
dream, my boys. 
That Nance appeared to me, 
She look'd like a 
mermaid, boys, 
That floats about the sea; 
She wagg'cl her tail at me, my boys I 
And then she shook her bead, 
Then seemed to speak in fishy tones 
And this is what she said, 
Good bye, John, &c. 
Our gallant craft reacli'd home, my boys. 
Next day to come on board, 
My Nance put off in a 
boat to meet 
Her John whom she ador'd. 
When, messmates—hard the tale to tell 
She swerved ! the boat capsized! 
Down, down to the bottom went sweet Nance, 
The girl I 
dearly priz'a— 
Spoken.—Aye, lads, there struggling in the embrace of the 
briny Hudson I 
beheld my own sweet Nance—and was I, a 
Yankee sailor, to stand by and see a 
Yankee female—and that 
female a 
woman in distress? 
No! to shiver my timbers, take 
a 
reef out of my slacks, and the quid out of my mouth was 
but the work of three quarters of an hour, and ,overboard I 
dived—when huzza! just as she was sinking for the thirtieth 
time I 
grasped her by the hair—the locks I 
loved so dear— 
saved ! saved I 
I 
cried, when horror 1 
her hair come off! 
She 
never told me that she wore a 
wig—and down she went gurg-
ling the words I 
hear the very wind that blows, 
Good bye, John, &c.

THE MABEL WALTZ. 
As 
Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
I 
once did know a 
pretty girl, 
She dressed so very neat; 
She used to run a 
sewing-machine, 
Down in Chatham Street. 
Her eyes were bright, complexion light, 
Her cheeks were like the rose; 
She'd a 
dimpled chin, and pouting lips, 
And a 
beautiful turn-up nose. 
I 
never can forget the night 
I 
met her at a 
ball: 
'Twas a 
fancy hop, a 
dollar a 
head, 
tip at Irving Hall. 
She looked so neat, I 
never thought she ever would prove false; 
Her step was light as the bounding fawn, dancing the Mabel 
Waltz. 
I 
often met her after that, 
Of tender things we talked; 
And, every Sunday out of two, 
I'd take her out to walk. 
I 
bought her lots of diamonds, 
At a-dollar-jewelry store, 
And also bought her a 
new silk-dress, 
Which every day she wore. 
In buying presents for that girl, 
I 
all my money spent, 
Until I 
found myself dead broke, 
And I 
hadn't got a 
cent. 
[CHORUS. 
And, then, I 
thought 'twas getting time 
The question for to pop. 
I 
went one day dressed in my best, 
Straight down to the shop: 
She didn't come; I 
asked the cause, 
And learned from one Miss Brown 
My charmer had, that very day, 
Just gone out of town. 
Judge my feelings when M iss Brown 
These cruel words let slip: 
It's my opinion she s 
gone off 
Upon her wedding trip.

" 
WALKING DOWN BROADWAY.". 
And when a 
year had passed away, 
At a 
window I 
did see 
My fair, but false one, sitting 
With a 
baby on her knee. 
I 
quickly marched into tbe house, 
And, there, what met my view! 
'Twas a 
tall Policeman, six feet high, 
lie was her husband, too! 
He collared me, and then commenced 
A 
series of assaults, 
I 
never chassez'd it so fast before, 
While dancing the Mabel Waltz. 
[CHORUS. 
" 
WALKING- DOWN BROADWAY." 
Sung by the GREAT LINGARD. 
The sweeteet thing in life 
And no one dare say nay, 
On a 
Saturday afternoon, 
Is walking down Broadway. 
My sisters, thro' the Park 
And at Long Branch wish to stay, 
But / prefer to walk 
Down the festive, gay Broadway. 
Walking Jowl\ Broadway— walking down Broadway— 
The 0. K. thing on Saturday is walking down Broadway. 
Walking down Broadway—the festive, gay Broadway; 
The 0 K thing on Saturday, is walking down Broadway. 
Last Wednesday afternoon 
My cmusin Will did say, 
"Nellie, come along with me, 
I'll take you down Broadway, 
To the Theatre Comiqi.e, - 
To see Captain Jinks so gay; 
Then we'll dine at Delmonieo's, 
'Fore returning down Broadway." 
DIALOGUE.—And I 
must say ladies and gentlemen, with all 
due deference to other pleasures in life, there's nothing so 
charming as— 
Walking down Broadway, &c.

WINKING AT ME. 
Kind friends, your attention I'll ask for a 
while, 
And I'll try to amuse you in my simple style, 
To sing to you nightly it's a 
pleasure, I 
see : 
For the gents in the house all keep winking at me. 
ettottus. 
Winking at me, winking at me, 
Now, how can I 
sing while you're winking at me? 
There's a 
gentleman sitting down there at the right, 
He came here to-day in a 
terrible plight, 
He's lately been jilted by a 
fair one you see, 
And now he comes here and keeps winking at me. 
Winking at me, &c. 
Mr. , 
our leader, as every one knows, 
Has lately contrived to let his mustache grow, 
He's got a 
nice wife, and big children three, 
Now, how can he play, while he's winking at me ? 
Winking at me, &c. 
There's a 
gentleman there now, who should be at kome, 
Rocking the cradle of babes he does own, 
Spoken.— Yes, that gentleman there who wears the blue 
cravat and has a 
rose in his buttonhole. 
No wonder you blush, sir, married man as you be, 
To sit there all night and keep winking at me. 
Winking at me, &c. 
There's a 
gent, sitting there, dressed with elegant taste. 
By the side of a 
lady, his arm round her waist, 
Au artful deceiver I 
fear he must be, 
For, while he makes love to her, be keeps winking at me. 
Winking at me, Sic. 
And now to conclude wiTh my silly rhymes, 
I 
hope I've not oill-nded or wasted my time, 
'Twas meant in a 
jest ; for, you plainly c . 0 
see, 
There's a 
boy in the gallery keeps winking at me. 
Winkhigat we, &c. 
CROSSING ON THE FERRY. 
Oh I 
please don't laugh when I 
relate 
, To you a 
story sweet: 
It's all about a 
charming girl 
That 1 
by chance did meet. 
'Twas love at first sight when we met, 
Those lips so red and cherry. 
Oh I 
what a 
stunning; girl it was, 
That I 
met on the ferry. 
CHORUS. 
Walking through the cabin, passing all the style, 
Smiling on the fair sex, hours to beguile, 
Nothing yet can cheer me ; for, I 
can't be merry, 
Since I 
met that little dear crossing on the ferry. 
I 
scarcely knew which way to look; 
For, she a 
magnet seemed ; 
Eiectric sparks I 
thought 1 
felt, 
S bright her eyes they beamed ; 
For, every glance was Lke a 
lance, 
As in my heart they'd bury : 
Until I 
felt, I 
scarce know bow, 
While crossing on the ferry. 
Walking througk the cabin, &c. 
Our journey's end at last approached, 
My heart beat slow and fast, 
While passengers ran here and there, 
My love among them passed. 
She turned her head and spoke to me. 
In a 
voice so soft and worry, 
Saying : Write a 
note to Station D. 
6ign, Crossing on the ferry. 
Walking through the uabin, &c.

WAITING FOR A BROADWAY STAGE. 
As up Broadway I 
strolled, one day, 
To see ibe styles pass by, 
A pretty iittle girl 1 
very soon met, 
And she had such a 
roguish eye. 
Her little short skirts in points hung down, 
ilia- styles all the rage 
She was looking up and down with a 
pretty little frown, 
Waiting for a 
Broadway-stage, oh 1 
She was just about the girl that's all the rage; 
Sweet sixteen was just her age 
1 
met her on the corner. it was there that first 
Waiting for a 
Broadway-stage. 
I 
saw her, 
She saw that I 
was looking at her, 
When a 
sweet little smile, like a 
beam, 
Just played round her face and, with such ease and grace 
Wily ince a 
little Angel she did seem. 
Bu: I 
kept getting like any one in fear, 
Ior, my he rt felt like a 
bird that's in a

How I 
wished I'd never seen that handsome little queen,

One day upon the street, 
I 
met a

The folks they stopped and stared-
Policemen holloed after, 
But not a

Her lovely curls were dancing, 
And faster went her steed 
I 
lost my hat and coat tails 
On my gay velocipede! 
Whiz ! Bang! Piz! Clang ! &c. 
I 
tried to " rein " my " racer," 
But faster went instead ; 
Another mile we blustered, 
Which found us both " ahead !" 
A peanut stand before Us, 
We neither one could heed— 
We struck it, 0, and busted up 
Our gay velocipede! 
Whiz ! Bang ! Fiz! Clang! &e. 
But there came a 
fellow, 
stylish sort of chap, 
He winked at my dulcinea ; 
To me a 
dire mishap; 
They dashed away together— 
He calmly smoked 
is weed--
And left me toddling after,

In the red brick'd hall, with moss covered wall, 
Where my father he lived and died, 
I 
live at my ease, and do as I 
please. 
Caring nought for the world so wide— 
The pluck of a 
lion, a 
muscle of iron, 
And a 
heart that is honest and true, 
Yet a 
heart that can always for others feel 
Altho' I'm Seventy-Two. 
Then cheer, boys, cheer, &o. 
No sluggard am I, in my bed to lie, 
I 
rise at early dawn. 
Thro' meadows I 
jog, with my gun and my dog, 
Or mount at the sound of the born. 
A 
seat in the saddle I 
still can keep, 
With a 
heigh, Tally ho, halloo! 
For my limbs are strong, and my wind is long, 
Altho' I 
am Seventy-Two. 
Then cheer, boys, cheer, &c. 
At Christmas time, IN lien the bells they chime, 
I've a 
welcome as well as a 
smile, 
And hearty good cheer for peasant or peer, 
In a 
jolly old English style. 
I'm fond of good sport, yet, nevertheless, 
My passions I 
always subdue, 
For it's only a 
fool that loves excess, 
And will never reach Seventy-Two. 
Then cheer, boys, cheer, &c. 
YES OR NO. 
A smile now gathers round thy lip, 
But not a 
word or sigh 
Escapes to tell if IM beloved, 
Or bid sad doubts to fly. 
I 
sue to thee, 110 crimson cheek, 
Reveals love's burning glow, 
Have pity on my throbbing heart, 
Say Yes, my love, or No.

HARD TIMES COME AGAIN NO MORR 
Let us pause in life's pleasure and count its many tears 
While we all grip sorrow with the poor ; 
There's a 
song that will linger for ever in our ears— 
" 
Oh I 
Hard Tunes come again no more." 
‘' 
CHORDS. 
'Tis the sang, the sigh of the weary; 
" 
Hard Times, Hard Times come again, no more ; 
Many days you have lingered around my cabin door, 
Oh, Hard Times come again no more." 
"While we seek mirth and music, and music light and gay, 
There are frail forms fainting at the door ; 
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say, 
" 
Oh, Hard. Times come again no more." 
'Tis the song, etc. 
There's a 
pale, drooping maiden, who toils her life away, 
With a 
worn heart whose better days are o'er ; 
Though her voice would be merry, ' tis sighing all the day— 
" 
Oh, Hard Times come again no more." 
'Tis the song, etc.

1* aROUGH THE PARK I 
GO. 
As sung by the GREAT 'ASGARD. 
Oh! I'm a 
girl that's fond of life, 
My age is twenty-one, 
I 
am averse to noise and strife, 
But very fond of fun; 
And though to vice I'm not inelia'd, 
like the flattery of nialakind, 
And always like to speak my mind, 
Alike to every one. 
CHORUS. 
1'41)r as through the park I 
go, 
The gents all want to know, 
" 
Who is that darling girl that drives so fg,' 
They'd like to know. 
I 
live at home with dear mam ma, 
And do just as I 
will, 
While lovers come from near and far, 
And me with nonsense fill; 
But I 
tell them all, I'll be a 
n-an, 
And beg they will at once have done, 
Bit then they say, I'm only in fun, 
As I 
laugh bcshind my fan. 
Spoken.—Well, of course I 
am in fun sometimes. 'Twas 
only the other evening, mum-ma took me to a 
ball, and bought 
me this new dress from Madame Wintle for the occasion, for 
mam-ma said, I 
must put on my best smiles and graces, for I 
was getting rather- old and it was quite time I 
was *off her 
hands. 
Poor mam-ma! she always has my interest at heart. 
So after the 13a11 was over one dear young fellow began to ad-
dress me, and I 
really thought he was going to propose, but 
another gent came in and spoiled it all, and I've many times 
heard them both remark— 
" 
As through the park I 
go, tte."

THE VAT•LER GAL THAT WINKED AT NE. 
Music by M . 
A . 
H ERIIANDEZ. 
Your attention I 
ask for a 
while, 
To a 
song I'm going to sing you, 
It's about a 
pretty yaller gal I 
met while I 
was walking, 
And she threw such a 
glance at me— 
She was pretty and as sweet as a 
flower, 
Such clothes you never did see— 
She'd a 
darling little bonnet with a 
flower-garden on it, 
Had the yaller gal that winked at me. 
CHORUS. 
Oh my! she looked so sweet and she dressed so neat, 
With her tilting-hoops and pretty little feet, 
As she went skipping along. 
Pretty little yaller gal I 
met while I 
was walking, 
As she skipped across the gutter, my heart went in a 
flutter, 
For the yaller gal that winked at me. 
I 
immediately asked her name, 
And she said it was Lucinda 
She said I 
was a 
stunner, and for life that I 
had won her, 
And married we should be. 
So, I'd dress up, and I'd walk by her house, 
Every afternoon, about three, 
And I'd glance up at the window for to see my dear Lucinda, 
She's the yaller gal that winked me. 
Oh my she looked, &c. 
Oh! you should have seen her, on her wedding day— 
She was handsome as a 
Venus— 
When the Parson made us one, ah then 1 
the thing was done, 
And I 
never felt so happy in my life. 
So, I've bought a 
little place out of town— 
If you go by, stop in and see— 
You'll be welcomed by a 
wife that's as dear to me as life, 
She's the yaller gal that winked at me. 
Oh my I 
she looked, &c.

THE CHARNING YOUNG WIDOW 
I MET ON THE TRAIN. 
Whilst in New-Jersey, a 
letter was sent to me 
From Boston, which bid me quickly repair 
To an uncle ; it stated: fast he was dying, 
The wish had expressed to make me his heir. 
So, hurriedly packing a 
f3w things together, 
Wishing that Boston quickly might gain, 
By a 
first-class express went; in the same carriage, 
A charming young widow I 
met on the train. 
An infant she had, so fondly caressing; 
I 
ventured to ask, if that was her own ? 
She answered in words a?pearing distressing— 
Yes; and its Papa is dead and gone! 
When the question I 
asked, in my face looking— 
That look I 
shall ne'er be forgetting again! 
In fact, fast my heart to herself was hooking, ' 
Was the charming young widow I 
met on the train, 
As the train it was stopping, the engine to water, 
She asked in a 
hurry—Would I 
be so kind 
Her infant to take it, the darling so quiet ? 
Of course, I 
replied, I 
don't mind. 
To the refreshment room she went into 
The signal for starting I 
heard but in vain, 
Not a 
glimpse could I 
see of her; the train without started 
The charming young widow I 
met on the train. 
Loud I 
was shouting, the train to be stopping, 
Out of the window putting my head ; 
No answer receiving, the infant I 
took it, 
Discovered, 0 
horror ! it was dead 
On its bosom was sewn a 
note—which on reading, 
Found I 
was taken in, done for, quite plain— 
It begged. me bury the child for the sake el 
The charming young widow I 
met on the train.. 
It was strange to myself that I 
was remarking 
flow quiet a 
child, not hearing a 
sound— 
The sweet little creature csleep was, she told me; 
Quite dead, asleep—so, in truth I 
found. 
I 
took it, and buried the poor little creature, 
Its age or its name I 
could not explain; 
On a 
stone was inscribed—Underneath was bequeathed me 
By a 
charming youug widow I 
met on the train.
