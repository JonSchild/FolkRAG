ant a 
valiant Irishman, 
My name is Jack O'Hare; 
I 
was born in Tipperary, 
There's no place that's so fair; 
I 
came to New York City, 
And it was my settled plan; 
To try and get elected, 
To be be an Alderman. 
Down the street with bead erect, 
All the ladies gaze on me; 
Smiling as I 
pass them by, 
I 
always look so neat you see; 
Happy hearted, light and gay, 
Arid I'm always free from care; 
The joliest chap in all the town, 
Is gallant Jack O'Hare. 
When I 
lived home, my mother said 
Jack, asthore, machree; 
Don't ere forget old Ireland, 
Wherever you may be; 
The land that gave O'Connell birth, 
Emmet and Wolfetone; 
Jack, my son, don't ere forget, 
Your dear old Irish home.

(Chorus). 
soon became a 
voter, 
And worker, too, as well; 
Around the Polls on Election Day, 
Oh would'ut I 
cut a 
swell; 
My friends they waited on me, 
Saying come and join the gang; 
And in spite of the very Devil, 
We'll make you an Alderman. (Chorus). 
THE CANDIDATE. 
Recited by 31R. .T. 
F. 
SULLIVAN, of CRONIN & SULU-VAN. 
.----
" 
Father, who travels the road so late?" 
"Hush, my child; 'tis the candidate." 
Fit example of human woes— 
Early he comes and late he goes; 
He greets the women with courtly grace, 
He kisses the baby's dirty face, 
He calls to the fence the farmer at work, 
He bores the merchant, he bores the clerk, 
The blacksmith, while his anvil rings, 
He greets, and this is the song he sings: 
" 
Howdy, howdy, howdy do? 
How is your wife, and how are you? 
All! it fits my fist as no other can, 
The horny hand of the workingman." 
" 
Husband, who is that man at the gate?" 
"Hush, my love; ' tis the candidate." 
"Husband, why can't he work like you! 
Has he nothing at home to do?" 
My dear, whenever a 
man is down, 
No cash at home, no money in town, 
Too stupid to preach, too proud to beg, 
Too timid to rob, and too lazy to dig, 
Then over his horse his legs he flings, 
And to the dear people this song he sings: 
Howdy, howdy, howdy do? 
how is you; wife, and how are you? 
Aut! it fits my fist as no other can, 
The horny hand of the workingman." 
Brothers, who labor early and late, 
Ask these things of the candidate: 
What's his record? How does he stand 
At home? No matter about his hand, 
Be it hard or soft, so it be not prone 
To close over money not his own. 
Has he in view no thieving plan? 
Is he honest and capable?—he is our man. 
Cheer such a 
one till the welkin rings, 
Join in the chorus when thus he sings: 
"Howdy, howdy, howdy do? 
How is your wife, and how are you? 
Ah! it fits my fist as no other can, 
The horny hand of the workingman."

TERRY McGOON. 
Sung by M. CRONIN with immense success at N IBLO'S THEATRE, 
N. Y„ in the great Irish Drama, " The Hearts of Steel." 
Oh I 
have loved often, and I 
have loved many, 
But theres none in this wide world like sweet little 
Terry; 
His eyes are as bright as the stars in the sky, 
And my heart it is thumping whenever he's nigh; 
If there was an island way over the sea, 
And only room on it for Terry and me; 
Oh, I'd live there alone from December till June, 
Along with my darling, sweet Terry McGoon. 
CHORUS: 
Terry! Terry! Terry McGoon, 
Hoist up your window and look at the moon; 
Oh I'd knock any man to the middle of June, 
That dared to make love to you, Terry McGoon. 
It I'M; only last Sunday, says Terry to me, 
Just make up your mind, girl, and married we'll be; 
But my mother she told me, and here's what she said, 
Don't ever get married, but live an old maid; 
But my mother's advice I 
put out of my head, 
I 
won't be an old maid; I 
wish they were dead! 
Oh! he promised to meet me by the light of the moon, 
For he is my darling, sweet Terry MeGoon.

LARRY McHALE. 
Words and Music by M R, J. 
P. 
SULLIVAN, of CRONIN & SULLIVAN, and 
Sung by him with great success. 
Larry MclIale he had nothing to fcar; 
Oh, he never could want; if the crops didn't fail. 
He'd a 
house and domain and five hundred a 
year, 
And the heart for to spend it had Larry Mcliale; 
The life of a 
party, the sowl of a 
feast, 
An illigant song he could sing, I'll be bail; 
lie would ride with Rector, or drink with Priest, 
For the broth of a 
boy was bold Larry McHale. 
Oh its little he cared for the Judge or Recorder, 
His house was as big and as strong as a 
Jail; 
With a 
cruel Four Pounder, that kept all in order, 
He would murder the parish, would Larry Mc Hale; 
A Blunderbuss, too, of Horse Pistols a 
pair, 
But his favorite weapon was always a 
Flail; 
Oh, you'd laugh to see how he'd empty a 
fair, 
For he handled it neatly, did Larry McHale. 
With his larder well supplied, and his cellar well 
stored, 
None lived half so well from Fairhead to Kinsale; 
As he piously said. I've a 
plentiful Board, and 
The Lord he is good to old Larry MclIale; 
So fill up your glasses, a 
high bumper give him, 
Its little we'd eve for the Tithes or Repeal, 
And old Ireland would be a 
fine country to live in, 
If the people were all there like Larry Mcliale. 
THE BRADY'S FROM TRA-LEE. 
Written by Ma. J. P. SULLIVAN, and sung with unbounded applause 
by CRONIN S: 
SULLIVAN in their original and laughable Sketch, 
Entitled, " Just Landed." 
We're an honest Irish couple, 
As you can plainly see; 
We left our native land behind, 
So far across the sea; 
We're just landed in America, 
The Home of Liberty; 
We are Dan and Nancy Brady, 
From the town of sweet Tra-lee. 
CHORUS: 
Then give us both a 
welcome, 
To the birth- place of the free; 
We're an honest Irish couple, 
Our hearts are filled with glee; 
We will treasure up your kindness, 
Wherever we may be; 
We're Dan and Nancy Brady, 
From the town of sweet Tra-lee. 
We left our homes in Ireland, 
And it grieved our -hearts full sore; 
But the famine it was raging, 
People dying by the score; 
The landlords had no pity, 
So we were forced to flee; 
And seek a 
home in America, 
Far, far from sweet Tr-lee. 
(Chorus). 
Now, we'll pray God bless poor Ireland, 
Wherever we may go; 
God bless the land that sent us aid, 
To help us in our woe; 
The griping hand of famine, 
May your people never see; 
Is the prayer of every Irishman, 
And the Brady's from Tra-lee. ( Chorus).

MORNING ON THE IRISH COAST, 
By JOHN LOCKE. 
Recited by Mr. J. F. SULLIVAN, Of CRONIN & SULLIVAN, at HARRY 
M INERS'S THEATRE, N. 
Y ., and throughout the country. 
Th' anam an Dhia! but there it is, 
The dawn on the hills of Ireland! 
God's angels lifting the night's black veil 
From the fair, sweet face of my sireland! 
Oh, Ireland, isn't it grand you look, 
Like a 
bride in her rich adornin', 
And with all the pent up love of my heart, 
I 
bid you the top o' the mornin'. 
This one short hour pays lavishly back 
For many a 
year of mourning; 
I'd almost venture another night, 
There's so much joy in returning— 
Watching out for the hallowed shore, 
All other attractions scornin'; 
Oh, Ireland, don't you hear me shout? 
I 
bid you the top o' the mornin'. 
Ho— ho! upon Cleena's shelving strand, 
The surges are grandly beating, 
And Kerry is pushing her headlands out 
To give us the kindly greeting; 
Into the shore the sea-birds fly 
On pinions that know no drooping; 
And out from the cliffs, with welcomes charged,' 
A million of waves come trooping. 
Oh, kindly, generous Irish land, 
So leal and fair and loving, 
No wonder the wandering Celt should think 
And dream of you in his roving! 
The alien home may have gems and gold— 
Shadows may never have gloomed it; 
But the heart will sigh for the absent land, 
Where the love- light first Mimed it. 
11. 
MORNING ON THE IRISH COAST—CONTINUED. 
And doesn't old Cove look charming there, 
Watching the wild waves' motion, 
Leaning her back up ag dnst the hills, 
And the tip of her toes on the ocean? 
I 
wonder I 
don't hear Shandon's bells, 
Ah, may be their chiming's over, 
For it's many a 
year since I 
began 
The life of a 
Western rover. 
For thirty summers, astore machree, 
Those hills I 
now feast my eyes on, 
Ne'er met my vision, save when they rose 
Over Memory's dim horizon. 
E'en so, '
twas grand and fair they seemed 
In the landscape spread before me; 
But dreams are dreams, and my eyes would ope 
To see Texas' sky still o'er me. 
Ah! oft upon the Texan plains, 
When the day and the chase were over, 
My thoughts would fly o'er the weary wave, 
And around this coast-line hover; 
And the prayer would rise, that some future day 
- 
All danger and doubtings scornin' , 
.I'd help to win my native land 
The light of young liberty's mornin'. 
Now fuller and truer the shore-line shows— 
Was ever a 
scene so splendid! 
I 
feel the breath of the Munster breeze, 
Thank God that my exile's ended. 
Old scenes, old songs, old friends again, 
The vale and cot I 
was born in! 
Oh, Ireland, up from my heart of hearts, 
I 
bid you the top of the morain'.

Parody on Full Moons. 
Written by Edwin Talbot, and sang with great suecc.ss by 
Billy Carter. 
The noble order of Ancient Bums, 
That ain't got any stamps, 
Are trying to form a 
No-work Club 
With the always-idle tramps. 
They sit in overy public park, 
Or lay upon the grass, 
And beg a 
chew of tobacco, boys, 
From any one who'l pass. 
The first to eat, the first to drink, 
Then march down Broadway, 
They pick up stumps and work the pumps, 
They're the terrors of the day. 
CHORUS. 
When the little tramps are begging, 
They say they never begged before, 
They'll sleep in a 
cart or some alley, 
And beg at every basement, basement door. 
They take the road the 1st of may, 
Put lightning on their heels, 
And steal the farmers chickens and corn 
If they don't get three square meals; 
Beat every freight train in the land, 
When they're catched they make ' ern sick, 
And when snow falls upon the around 
To the city double quick. 
The first to eat, the first to drink, 
They're as quiet as a 
mouse when asking 
The Captain of Police fcr to sleep in the Station House.

Chorus.

Paddle Your Boat Along. 
Sung with great success by EDWIN BARRY. 
This world we live in is just like the sea, 
Travelers over its waters are we ; 
Try to be happy where'er you may be, 
If the wind should blow steady and strong. 
It's no use to grumble, to growl or complain, 
You can't stop the wind nor you can't stop the rain, 
After a 
storm we have sunshine again— 
So paddle your boat along. 
CHORUS. 
Always try to be happy and gay, 
Let this world jog on as it may ; 
Always do right and never do wrong, 
As you paddle your boat along. 
There are people we meet who always seem glad, 
Others who always seem solemn and sad. 
They want all the good but won't share the had ; 
Now I 
think that decidedly wrong. 
There are good things enough in this world for us all . 
If we be content with a 
share of the small, 
Tho' little our lot, some have nothing at all, 
So paddle your own boat along. 
Always try to be happy, &c. 
Don't be down-hearted, though breakers may roar, 
Or if your boat be cast on the shore; 
You are sure to get into smooth water once more 
If you pull steady and strong. 
Don't pull too slow nor yet pull too fast, 
But always make way for a 
friend to get past. 
The harbor of safety you'll reach well at last, 
If you paddle your boat along. 
Always try to be happy, 8ze.

Parody on the Old Arm Chair, 
Written by GEO. CAREY. 
Dedicated to JIM :
1\T
AREy the Irish Bull Frog. 
Not many years ago in Ireland you must know, 
That a 
cousin of mine he turned up his toes, 
And a 
funny thing he said before he went to bed, 
That he would will to me all of his old clothes. 
Says one of his aunts I 
want his vest and pants, 
And his cats and dogs, besides his billy goat, 
Says I 
take all he is worth, but leave him his old shirt, 
And let me have his old hat and his old coat. 
CHORUS. 
How his sisters and his aunts, 
How they wrestled for to get his pants, 
His mother-in-law made a 
race for the goat, 
I 
never thought that I 
would get his hat or coat. 
With the fright my cousin died, his hat and coat was all his pride, 
And that night before my bed-side there he stood, 
The coat and hat was on the bed, oh my God I 
was in dread 
That he'd lay his hands upon me and I'd choke. 
But he kept so awful still, that he drove me in a 
chill, 
Oh ! heavens, shure I 
thought that I 
would croak, 
But he looked me in the eyes and he grabbed the coat and dize, 
Shure he walked off with me darling hat and coat. 
How his sisters, &c.

Air.—" Pretty Red Nose." 
I'm a 
man who has seen better days, 
And wore the finest of clothes, 
But to drinking I 
took pretty hard, 
And the result is my runt-eolored nose. 
In the parks I 
do sleep in the night time, 
On the ground where the green grass grows. 
But wherever I 
go all the people say no, 
When they look at my rum- colored nose. 
Cnonus. 
My rum-
colored nose. oh, my rum-
colored nose, 
The boys all tell me it's as red as a 
rose, 
And when I 
look in the glass, it blooms pretty fast, 
Then 1 
feel for my rum- colored nose. 
The other morning I 
got up at five, 
For a 
drink to a 
ginmill I 
went, 
When the bartender wanted his pay 
I 
told him I 
hadn't a 
cent, 
Then he hit me right square in the face, 
And my eyes then commenced for to close, 
But the worst of all when the gang did bawl, - 
" 
Get on to his rum-colored nose." 
Cnouus. 
My rum-colored nose; my rum- colored nose, 
I'll have it pulled like a 
tooth, my rum- colored nose, 
I'll take a 
lobster's claw, and steal my mother- in law, 
If she speaks of my rum- colored nose.

Arrah, my name is Isaac Murphy, 
And 
have ye all to know 
That I 
was born in China, 
Near the county of Mayo. 
I 
can walk six months and never stop, 
I 
can run faster than a 
train ; 
Faith, I 
am soon going over to England, 
To bring thc belt Rowell took back again. 
CHORUS. 
I'll walk the first hundikd miles on my head, 
The second on my toes; 
The third I'll walk on my eye-brows, 
And the fourth upon my nose. 
The fifth and last I'll walk on my ear, 
Then the Atlantic I 
walk across, 
Sure the Philadelphia Bladder says, 
Of all walkers I 
am the boss. 
I 
can walk from here to Australia and back 
In about three days and a 
half, 
Or around the world in a 
hundred hours— 
When I 
told O'Leary he gave me the laugh. 
I 
can walk for a 
year without any sleep, 
And keep waltzing around on the track; 
It would take me ninety minutes, just, 
To walk from here to Germany and back. 
I'll walk the first hundred, & c. 
Murphy's Dream. 
Written by GEORGE MURPHY, and performed by GEORGE and JOHN 
MURPHY. 
George and John Murphy stayed out a 
whole night, 
And the truth is they drank too Much beer, 
And when they got home they both were so tight, 
That both of their heads felt quite queer. 
Let's sit down and rest ourselves," George said to John ; 
" 
Let's try and recollect where we've been ;" 
So they sat down, but, oh, in a 
minute or two, 
They were asleep and beginning to dream. 
Now dreaming is funny-.—your mind wanders away— 
Some dream they are a 
king, some a 
goat, 
Why, I 
dreamt Cother night, peculiar to say, 
I 
was an engine on the elevated railroad. 
But the AIurphys they dreamed that in Paris they were, 
Looking for a 
first-class hotel, 
In their valises was gold, but how it got there 
Neither of the Murphys could tell. 
They dreamt George was a Dutchman, and that his name 
was Jake, 
With his clothes tore, and bald-headed at that, 
That John was an Irishman, and from jail he did break, 
That his name wasn't John, kit was Pat ; 
Among lunatics surely they thought that they were, 
Who they tried to kill, strange it did seem ; 
That they were arrested and caught in a 
snare, 
This the Mnrphys all saw in their dream. 
They dreamt .to the gallows they both had to go, as their 
sentence was they had to die ; 
That they mounted the scaffold, John quickly, George slow, 
and that neither a 
t,m .,ted to cry. 
They dreamt that hanging them wasn't severe, 
But imagined that it would cause lots of fun •, 
That the soldiers and sheriffs all stood quite near, 
To make sure that the murderers were hung; 
They dreamt that the trap fell and that they were dead, how 
strange the sensation did seem, 
But the truth was the beer had got into their heads and 
caused such a 
ridiculous dream.

MURPHY, ANCHOR YER FEET. 
'Sr7it,ten by Edwin Talbot, and sung by Murphy & Mack 
An Irishman, as you can see, 
I'm known both far and wide. 
Since I've been in this country 
I 
have been the people's pride, 
When first I 
landed in New York 
It filled me with conceit, 
The kids say, " Murph, for digging turf, 
You have the real elegant feet. 
CHORUS—' 
For the other day I 
heard them say 
That me nose looked like a 
beet, 
Then all the gang with vulgar slang. 
Roared, Murphy, anchor yer feet. 
My Delia Clancy, that's the girl I 
love, 
Sure I 
called on her the other night, 
And swore by all the clouds above. 
For there was none out that night, 
Says I, " My darling charming Delia, 
My heart is yours complete." 
Says she, - I 
won't have any funny business, 
Oh, Murphy, anchor yer feet." 
Chorus 
Sure it's President they say I'd be, 
If it wasn't for this hullabaloo. 
If my head was only the size of my feet, 
And of course that's very true. 
You might know I'm a 
prominent man, 
For every one I 
meet as I 
stroll along. 
You'll hear the gang shout, " Holloa, 
— 
Murphy, anchor yer feet."

With banners proudly floating o'er the gallant Irishmen.

At night we're ready to join the fun and take a

do.

Good evening to you, one and all, 
Here we are, your honor, 
Here sir, there sir! 
Every one is calling; 
We left the shop just now, to get 
A 
drink aro an' t 
the corner! 
Some tonic here, bay rum there! 
Everybody's bawling ; (Sym.) 
They looked so cross, when we came out, 
And wondered what we were about, 
We went to drink a 
bottle of stout 
We're the Irish dancing barbers. 
Dance, Irish Jig. 
The boss, he leaves town twice a 
week, 
He makes us watch each other; 
Good morning, your'e next, 
Every one is shouting; 
(Sym.) 
Saturday night we shave so quick, 
That some with lather smother; 
hurry up, comb my hair ! 
Faith some deserve a 
clouting ; 
We scent them up and curl their hair, 
With elegance we make them stare, 
We sometimes get double fare; 
We're the Irish dancing barbers. 
Dance, Red. 
All strange customers we shave, 
We know just how to treat them; 
Lather ' ern up, brush 'em up I 
The shop is quickly filling ; 
(Sym.) 
We never make no extra charge, 
Nor do we ever beat them; 
Curl 'em up, oil your hair! 
You'll owe us just a 
shilling ; 
(

We told you what we had to say, 
So when you ever come our way, 
Step inside, and the,re you'll see 
The Irish dancing barber.

My name is Paddy McCoy, 
I'm a 
true- born Irishman ; 
I 
love my adopted country, 
And do for her all I 
can. 
I've not very long been over, 
But I'm smart enough at that, 
Though whenever I 
go to take a 
walk 
The boys will holler " Pat." 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Paddy McCoy, from where did you come, 
You're a 
regular Irish mick ; 
Look at the flannel-mouth son- of-a-gun, 
And gaze on his blackthorn stick. 
In politics I'm a 
leading man, 
In the Fourth Ward I 
reside; 
I 
elect my men again and again, 
And with the boys the sugar divide. 
When any man wants an office, 
To me he is certain to come, 
I 
will send him there as sure as fate, 
If he planks down a 
good round sum. 
Oh, Paddy McCoy, & c. 
So, if any of you wants to be Governor, 
Come and have a 
chat with me, 
And if we can come to arrangements 
Why, Governor you surely will be ; 
For the boys I 
must treat to lager, 
And cigars and whiskey too; 
Now, what wealth do you think you'll stand': 
Just say a 
thousand or two. 
Oh, Paddy McCoy, &c.

with great success at all the principal theatres in the 15. S. 
We're two jolly Irish lads and from Ireland came o'er, 
In a 
big steamship across the deep blue sea, 
We left behind us there a 
darling young and fair, 
And I 
know that she'll prove true to me. 
She is fairer than the flowers that are blooming in the 
spring, 
And soon she'll take a 
trip across the sea, 
And when we're sideby side we will trip it off in style, 
When together then how happy we wit be. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, don't I 
love my Mollie, she's now in Ireland, 
Tier eyes would captivate you at a 
glance, 
And when we're side by side we will trip it off in style. 
And do for you our Irish song and dance. 
When we were leaving Ireland, across the sea to roam, 
From her we found it very hard to part, 
And the treasure hat she gave me when I 
was going 
away, 
Was a 
lock of hhir which I 
wear next my heart. 
Although the sea divides us lam dreaming night and day 
Of the colleen whom we left across the sea, 
But soon she'll take a 
trip o'er the water in a 
ship, 
When together then how happy we will be.

Written by Edwin Talbot. 
Music by Dick Devlin. 
sung by Devlin & Tracy with great success in their great 
specialty acts and sketches. 
I 
heard the Nightingale's voice the woodland's tufts 
among, 
Yet sweeter were the tender notes of Miss Kelly's song, 
So soft into the ear they steal, so soft into the soul. 
The deep'ning pain of love they soothe and sorrow's pang 
control. 
CHORUS— 
Singing- merrily, soft and cheerily, 
Meadly, cheerily, soft and merrily, 
Singing- cheerily, merrily, cheerily, 
Through the woodlands all day long. [ Repeat. 
I 
look upon the pure brook that murmured through the 
glade, 
And mingled in the melody that my Miss Kelly made, 
Yet purer \'as the residence of Miss Kelly's heart, 
Above the reach of pride and guile above the reach of art,

I've got a 
daughter I 
talk to all day, 
But the devil a 
word will she mind what I 
say, 
In spite of advice she'd go far away, 
Sometimes she cannot be found. 
If I 
say stay at home, begorra she'll get mad, 
She'll call me an mid tad, say I've got them bae 
Inside of an oyster I 
ought to be clad, 
To a 
nannie goat I 
ought to be bound. 
CHORUS. 
Ah, but if I 
catch the man 
That taugizt her to dance 
The la-de-da dance, the tra-le-la dance. 
On the top of his nose I'll make my fist prance, 
And twist off the both of his legs, ha, ha! 
At night she'll put on her fol-de-lol-lols, 
Then she'll skip off to her picnics and baits, 
Then on the neighbors she'll make her grand cans, 
Borrow all the clothes that she can. 
For a 
bustle she'll wear my coderie pants, 
My chin-chilly vest, or anything by chance. 
But if I 
catch the laddie-buck that taught her to danec, 
/11 twist off the both of his legs.

INIy name is O'Brien from Harlem, 
An Irishman as you can see; 
I 
can sing like a 
thrush or a 
starling, 
Or the little bird up in a 
tree. 
But the gang that stands there on the corner, 
Are trying the steps and the dance; 
And they shout out whenever I'm passing, 
There's O'Brien with his high-water pants. 
CHORUS: 
They tell me to go over to England, 
And pay a 
short visit to France; 
And there to bring out my new fashions, 
And call them the high-water pants. 
Last week I 
went to the theatre, 
Along with my first cousin Dan; 
We hired a 
seat down in the parquette, 
Behind the big man in the band. 
When a 
pager came out with a 
banjo, 
lie played up a 
high-land clog dance; 
And he gave out a 
gag and a 
con-nun-drum, 
'Bout O'Brien and his high-water pants. 
Chorus. 
One night as I 
strolled down the Bowery, 
Along with a 
friend, Paddy Brock. 
We tho't we'd just drop into Geoglian's, 
To try some of his rye and rock. 
When the gang all cried there's Dan O'Leary, 
The bar-keeper shot me a 
glance; 
" 
Howld your tongues " then said he to the loafers 
That's O'Brien with his high-water pants.

You Were False, But I'll Forgive You. 
Sung with immense success by _ Miss Georgie MeInoue, 
the Queen Serio-Comique. 
Fare thee well, for once I 
loved you, 
Even more than tongue can tell, 
Little did I 
think you'd leave me, 
Now I 
bid you all farewell. 
You have wrecked the heart I 
cherished, 
You have doomed me day by day, 
You are false but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may. 
[Repeat last two lines. 
When I 
saw your eyes in virtue, 
I 
could scarce believe my own, 
When I 
heard your voice in anger, 
It was death to every tone. 
They have told you some false stories, 
And you believed them all they say, 
You are false but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may. 
[Repeat last two lines.1 
One more word and all is over, 
Why are you unkind to me? 
Tell me why you do not love me, 
Turn aside how can it be ? 
No word not one word of pleasure, 
You believe them all they say, 
You are false but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may.

On Scotland's fair hills, or the mountains and rills, 
I've \vandered there many a 
happy day; 
In looking at the lads and the lasses on the green, 
'Neath the tine old hills of Scotland far away. 
I've looked for her coming, but she's not come as yet, 
The truth seems to dawn on me plain; 
They say she is false but I'll still believe her mine, 
She's my darling blue-eyed Scotch lassie Jean. 
0 Jean, my dearest Jean! 
Come to your laddie once again ; 
They say you are false, but I'll still believe you mine, 
You're my darling blue-eyed Scotch lassie Jean. 
She said she soon would meet me, but I've waited long in 
vain, 
In lands far away she doth roam ; 
Her promise she will keep, 0 ! break it not, my Jean, 
We'll be happy in our bonnie little home. 
Then let me not long wait, let me meet you soon, Inv Jean, 
And Heav'n will then smile on our love ; 
And when life is ended, we'll leave this earthly scene, 
When our hearts will dwell in joy and bliss above.

I 
came to tell you I 
am in love, 
With a 
girl lives on a 
farm, 
She feeds the pigs, does Irish jigs, 
And possesses a 
lovely charm. 
Her teeth are like the snow so wHte, 
She is the prettiest girl for miles, 
Her hair it hangs, she wears no bangs, 
And her face is covered with smiles. 
CHORUS. 
For she is the maid that I 
adore, 
I 
am sure I'd call her mine, 
For I 
know that I 
would surely die, 
Without little Nellie O'Brien. 
She is as pure and innocent as a 
lamb, 
Her face I 
can't forget, 
She is her mother's only joy, 
And her father's little pet. 
I've proposed and she has accepted, 
Soon I 
will take her hand, 
The twelfth of May is our weclaing- day, 
Then we'll join the matrimonial band.

Here I 
am, an Irishman, I'd have you for to know, 
I 
always make myself at home no matter where I 
go. 
I 
know all the blackguards stand on the corner here below, 
And insult decent people as they pass to and fro. 
Every night when I 
go out, oh at me they will shout: 
Will you stag the old flannel-mouth! 
Go shoot that hat quick, you old coffin-back Mick ! 
Yes, this is what those blackguards say to me. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, yes, bye bye Mick will hit you with a 
brick, 
Some druggist ought to hire you to make people sick, 
I'll meet you on the corner some Sunday when you're out! 
Yes, that's the way these rowdies at me shout. 
(Repeat.) 
At night now, when my work is done, and to walk I 
feel 
inclined, 
It's down on the corner these boys I'm sure to find, 
With their Piccadilly collars and their skinny tight light pants, 
They look like dancing masters just imported here from France. 
Every night when I 
go out, why at me they will shout: 
Oh, stag the old flannel-mouth ! 
Go shoot that hat quick, you old coffin-back Mick ! 
Yes, that is what these blackguards say to me.

We play the concertina, likewise the sweet banjo, 
The Murplays and O'Neils come up to see the weather, 
We're highly elevated until we go below. 
Now up comes Mistress Hoolahan, 
With the baby in her arms, 
With pleasant conversation then,

Last Winter was a 
hard one, Mrs. Reilly, did you say? 
Well, ' tis myself that knows it, for it's many's the day 
Your husb .ind wasn't the only man sat behind the wall; 
There's my old man McGuiness didn't get no job at all; 
The Politicians promised him work on the Boulevard, 
To handle a 
pick and shovel, and throw dirt on the cart. 
Ali, six months ago they promised him work he'd shortly 
get, 
But believe me, my good woman, they are promising him 
yet. 
Cuouus: 
Then cheer up, Mrs. Reilly, 
Don't give away to the blues, 
You and I 
will cut a 
shine, 
New bonnets and new shoes; 
As for me, I'm done a 
crying, 
No more will I 
sigh or sob, 
I'll wait till times gets better, 
When McGuiness gets a 
job. 
The Italians, the devil take them, why didn't they stay at 
home, 
Sure we had plenty of our own class to ate up all our own; 
They come out like bees in Summer time and sworn for to 
stay; 
The contractors they have hundreds for forty cents a 
day, 
WHEN McGUINESS GETS A JOB.—CoynNuED. 
They work upon the railroad, they shovel snow and slush, 
But there's one thing in their favor, Italians they never do 
get lush; 
No, they always bring their money home, taste no gin or 
wine, 
And that's one thing I'd like to say of your old man aud 
mine. 
Then cheer up, Mrs. Reilly, etc. 
Ali! the Spring time now is coming we'll all have plenty 
work, 
McOldness will go back to his trade, shure he's a 
hand 
some clerk. 
fon should sae him climb the ladder as nimble as a 
fox, 
Faith he's the boy can handle the ould three- cornered box, 
The boss is always bawling, Iii! there, don't you stop, 
Keep your eyes upward, don't let no mortar drop;

She is the dead picture of her ma, 
She has a 
foot as big as a 
telegraph pole, 
Her features are like her pa. 
She has all the swells near crazy, 
An engagement for life she has signed, 
She is hitched to a 
man named Freddie AIcCan, 
He has a 
million dollars in his mind,

Grandmother's Chair.

My grandmother she at the age of eighty-three, 
One day in May was taken ill and died, 
And after she was dead, the will of course was read, 
By a 
lawyer as we all stood by his side, 
To my brother, it was found, she had left a 
hundred pounds. 
The same unto my sister I 
do declare, 
But when it came to me, the lawyer said I 
see, 
She has left to you her " Old arm-chair." 
CHORUS. 
And how they titter'd, how they chaff'd, 
How my brother and sister laugh'd, 
When they heard the lawyer declare 
Granny had only left to me her old arm chair. 
I 
thought it hardly fair, still I 
said I 
did not care, 
And in the ev'ning took the chair away, 
The neighbors they me chaff'd, my brother at me laugh'd 
And said it would be useful John, some day. 
When you settle down in life find some girl to be your wife, 
You'll find it very handy, I 
declare. 
On a 
cold and frosty night when the fire is burning bright, 
You can then sit in your old arm chair. 
And how they titter'd, &c. 
What my brother said came true for in a 
year or two, 
Strange to say I 
settled down in married life, 
I 
first the girl did court, and then the ring I 
bought, 
Took her to church and when she was my wife, 
The old girl and me, were as happy as could be, 
For when my work was over I 
declare, 
I 
ne'er abroad would roam but each night would stay at hornt, 
And be seated in my old arm chair. 
And how they titter'd, & c. 
One night the chair fell down, when I 
pick'd it up I 
found 
The seat had fallen out upon the floor. 
And there to my surprise, I 
saw before my eyes, 
A 
lot of notes, two thousand pounds or more, 
When my brother heard of this, the fellow I 
confess, 
Went nearly mad with rage and tore his hair, 
But I 
only laugh'd at him, and said unto him, Jem, 
Don't you wish you had the old arm chair? 
And how they titter'd, &v,

O'REILLY vs. McDERMOTT. 
Written by PATRICK NEESON for SAM RICKEY, and originally recited 
by EDWARD HALEY, of " The 2 HALEYS. 
Not one hundred yards from where I 
stand, 
In this, our glorious Union land, 
Was kept a 
first-class whisky stand 
By a 
man, and his name was O'Connor. 
A man that's known both near and far, 
Attends to Mike O'Connor's bar, 
He, in our late war, received no scar, 
And his name i 
O'Reilly. 
Beneath our starry banners wave, 
There was not a 
man fought half so brave, 
Or more greenbacks for whisky gave, 
Than McDermott. 
O'Connor's gin- mill blazed with light, 
On that eventful and bloody night, 
-When McDermott had the fearful fight 
With O'Reilly. 
With frowning brow and flashing eye, 
O'Reilly drank a 
glass of rye, 
1Vhich he demolished without a 
sigh; 
Then turning to McDermott, he said, 
You alcoholic vat! 
you drunken loon! 
You've no more brains than a 
wee gossoon; 
Begorra, I'll make you change your tune, 
Says McDermott. 
With sleeves rolled up, O'Reilly stood 
And swore he'd die, before he would 
Take back a 
single word that could 
In any manner be construed 
Into an apology to McDermott. 
McDermott went for O'Reilly's nose, 
And on it planted fearful blows, 
Till on his eye a 
shanty arose, 
Erected by McDermott. 
O'Reilly fell into a 
swoon, 
And his head rested on a 
big spittoon; 
Then he dreamt of Ballwin's big Balloon, 
While McDermott quietly put on his 
Coat, and went home about his business.

A 
Flower From My Angel Mother's Grave 
Words and music by HARRY KENNEDY, ventriloquist. 
Music copyrighted 1878, by W M. H. 
KENNEDY, 128 Duffield street, 
Brooklyn, N. V. 
Sung with great success by the German emperor, Gus '
WILLIAMS. 
I've a 
casket at home that is filled with precious gems ; 
I 
have pictures of friends dear to me, 
And I've trinkets so rare, that came many years ago. 
From my far distant home across the sea. 
But there's one sweet little treasure that I'll ever dearly prize, 
Better far than all the wealth beneath the wave ; 
Tho' a 
small faded flow'ret, that I 
placed in childhood's days. 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
CHORUS. 
'Treasured in my mem'ry like a 
happy dream, 
Are the loving words she gave, 
And my heart fondly cleaves to the dry and withered leaves— 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
In the quiet country churchyard they laid her down to sleep 
Close beside the old home she's at rest, 
And the low, sacred mound is enshrined within my heart, 
By the sweet ties of love forever blest. 
In the still and silent night I 
often dream of home again, 
And the visions ever tells me to be brave ; 
For the last link that binds me to the place I 
love so well, 
Is the flower from my angel mother's grave. 
Treasured in my mem'ry, & c.

Don't his darling look charming and sweet.

Just cast your eyes upon us, 
We're dressed up in the style, 
We are two nobby coachmen, 
And we're from ould Erin's Isle; 
Arrah 
it's many a 
happy day we seen 
In that Isle so far away, 
And the same we spint ever since we eft' 'e 
To swate America. 
When first we landed in New York, 
We wint to Union Square, 
Where we were engaged to drive 
A coach by a 
man named Dare; 
He brought us to his residence, 
Which was in Fourteenth Street, 
And the way we dressed and turned out, 
With us nothing could compete. 
CHORUS. 
Then give three hearty cheers, 
For the land of America, 
The same for dear ould Erin's Isle, 
Although she's far away; 
And whin ye meet us in the street, 
Yer hats to us just rise, 
And ye'll find we're just what ye may call— 
Two noble Irish boys. 
was engaged as footman, 
0.—And I 
was engaged to drive, 
And the way we turned out you'd think 
We were the happiest men alive; 
As we'd drive along through Broadway, 
The people all would say— 
" 
There goes two noble Irish boys, 
Oh, my! don't they look gay 1" 
Our boots and buttons shining bright, 
Our clothes so nice and clean, 
Such nobby Irish boys, my friends, 
Ne'er before was seen; 
And though we're now in America. 
And every thing is serene, 
We'll ne'er forget the land of our birth— 
That Emerald Isle so green. 
Then give three hearty cheers, etc.

Written by JERRY COHAN for W ALLY PRICE M OTTO SiNnER, 
Of all the great levers that move this world, 
The principal ones are but three; 
And when my strange argument I 
unfold, 
Wise people with me will agree. 
The Newspaper ball keeps rolling on, 
While the Pulpit controls the mind; 
The theories that these powers expound, 
Are moving ones you'll find. 
The Theatre, too, does not fail to improve, 
The wisdom of every age; 
So the principal levers that make the woi Id 
Are the Pulpit, the Press, and the Stage. 
Conviction is carried to every one, 
That this life's but a 
fleeting show; 
So Religion is the lever strong, 
To remind us of this, we know. 
Why the veriest hypocrite that can talk, 
And wear sanctimonious ways, 
Let him enter the Pulpit, we listen, and oft 
are persuaded to believe all he says. 
The Christian, the Infidel, no matter what, 
The wicked, good, weak and strong, 
Must acknowledge the Pulpit a 
lever of power, 
And it moves this world along. 
THE PULPIT, 
THE PRESS, 
AND THE STAGE. 
CONTINUED. 
Next comes the Press, a 
most wonderful power, 
That we love, we fear and admire; 
It tells us the doings of every hour, 
And of all events as they transpire. 
Its reviewed by all classes, all nations and men, 
Propounding the wrong and right; 
Observe how the Press has improved the world, 
And brought us from darkness to light. 
It brings closer together all countries apart, 
Of all races of men tis the voice; 
The Press moves the world with unerring power, 
'Tis a 
lever in which we rejoice. 
Next comes the Stage, nature's mirror so true, 
'Tis both criticised, praised and condemned; 
But the Pulpit and Press has abuses, too, 
And the Stage has so much to commend. 
The grandest of minds were its patron's, I'll prove, 
Even those who have worshipped the Press; 
And spoke from the Pulpit the doctrine we love, 
Its Charities cannot grow less. 
So the Stage moves the world with the Pulpit and 
Press, 
In one how ' twill portray a 
whole age; 
And the principal levers that move the world, 
Are the Pulpit, the Press and the Stage.

When you are gone and I'm alone, 
A

We've happy been, we'll happy be,

My heart will ache with pain, 
From mine eyes the tears will drop

There will come a

Then to me you'll return.

I'm not happy, but I'm vexed. 
I 
have ninety-nine relations, 
And they nearly drive me wild, 
Both one and all, both great and small, 
They want to name the child. 
My wife she said it'll be Michael, 
Her sister said it'll be Matt, 
Her brother said it'll be Charlie, 
Whilst her aunt said no, it'll be Pat. 
Whilst my mother wants him Shamus'

By heavens sure I 
don't know what 
I'll call the child at all.

My brother came from Troy, 
He swore by this, he swore by that, 
That he would name the boy. 
Says my wife's brother Darby, 
He be hanged if that would do, 
And they jumped together on the floor, 
And had a 
bold set-too. 
Next Sunday is the Christening, 
And I 
tell you by the way, 
I'll have none of their connivings, 
I'm bound to have my say. 
They may call him this, and call him that, 
I 
don't give that, for their call, 
I'm bound to call him Dennis, 
Or he'll have no name at all.

FISHER, 98 Nassau Street, New Yor!: 
Cornelius Duffy, the people's choice, 
A 
substantial, solid man, 
Will represent our government. 
And surely lead the van ; 
His head is full of learning, 
his constituents all agree, 
He'll hold the chair and rule it there, 
Far up in Albany. 
Then rise your voices every one, 
The enemy we will hunt, 
We'll rule New York, alt that's the talk, 
When Dully's to the front. 
You can drink your lager on Sunday then, 
And speak your mind at will, 
You can light all night, till broad day-light, 
The police can't keep you still; 
Your influence will be powerful, 
Led by a 
man of ability, 
When Cornelius Dufly's to the front, 
Far up in Albany.

THE SPORTING MAN. 
Written by HARRY BENNETT expressly for JAMES O'NEIL, of O'NEIL 
CoNnoY, Irish Comedians, Vocalists and Sketch Artists. 
I'm something of a 
sporting man, I 
often make a 
bet, 
I 
stand a 
chance of loosing, but I 
have not done it yet; 
I'm something of a 
wrestler, I 
often take it in, 
But when I 
take a 
thoroughbred, my chances are but slim; 
A 
little bit of pleasantry occurred the other night, 
I 
went to see a 
wrestling match which ended in a 
fight; 
A Dutchman, a 
Scotehman, a 
Frenchman and a 
Mick, 
And poor Johnny Reilly got plugged with a 
brick. 
Cllohus: 
Nobody knows what trouble was there, 
Nobody knows I 
do declare; 
Nobody knows what fun I 
did see; 
Nobody knows indeed but me. 
Now the cause of all the trouble I 
couldn't keep it mum, 
Some one called Jerry McIntyre a 
bum; 
Jerry jumped up, struck out with his hand, 
And swore lie could whip any cripple in the land; 
Big John Monahan standing in the door, 
Ile caught hold of McIntyre, and threw him on the floor; 
lie went for little Brady, and hit him such a 
whack, 
That he busted his undershirt plum off of his back. 
Oh when Brady he got up, he was a 
terrible looking sight, 
lie looked as if he slept -with the pigs all night; 
I 
le looked at his undershirt and then he dropped a 
tear, 
A 
ad then lie flew for Monahan and chewed off his ear; 
lie made one brace and landed at the bar, 
lie called for a 
hummer, and they crave him a 
cigar; 
He took a 
match to light it, and what do you suppose, 
it was chock full of powder, and it blew off his nose. 
Then they fought in the hallway, they fought in a 
room, 
And the things they used for boxing gloves was the bat 
room spittoons; 
They couldn't see each other they welted so hard, 
They set fire to the house and fought out in the yard. 
The police all came down in big platoons, 
And quick gathered up every fighting gossoon; 
Six months on the Island sure they all have to stay, 
For setting fire to the house on St. Patrick's Day.

You've heard of the heroes of far famed old England, 
That fought for their country on land and on wave, 
And bards of famed Scotland have sung songs and praises, 
And many brave sons that are laid in the grave; 
But I 
as an Irishman now sing in praise 
Of Erin's bold sons whose fame ever will last; 
From the days of bold Byron, the king of old Ireland, 
We have had many brave Irishmen of the past. 
There's Curran the lawyer, a 
son of old Erin, 
Whose sayings and doings are known far and wide, 
His wit and his elegant manner of speaking 
Won many foes over as friends, to his side; 
There's Tom Moore the poet, all Irishmen love him. 
His work with the greatest on earth might be classed; 
Whilst an Irishman lives those two names they'll re-
member, 
As two of the great Irishmen of the past. 
There are scores of great speakers whom I 
could now 
mention. 
But foremost ig Burke, who is well known to fame. 
His great nine days' speech was more than nine days'

THE GREAT IRISHMEN OF THE PAST.—CoNnNuED. 
All men should respect that great Irishman's name. 
There is Goldsmith, well known as an elegant writer, 
And Dean Swift, the great wit, though they call the 
style fast; 
And bold Isaac Butt, who has lately passed from us, 
All these have proved great Irishmen of the past. 
Lord Wellington he was a 
son of old Erin, 
And a 
credit I'm sure to the land of his birth, 
As a 
true-hearted man and a 
prince of all soldiers, 
All England knows well that great Irishman's worth; 
It was him that first conquered the mighty Napoleon, 
lie feared not the foe nor the winter's cold blast, 
And as things stand at present old England could do with 
Some more like the great Irishmen of the past. 
The greatest of Irishmen now I 
will mention; 
O'Connell the patriot it is that I 
mean, 
ills life he spent struggling for old Ireland's freedom, 
And the good of the dear little Island of green; 
For wit and for eloquence none could approach him, 
His name and his fame through all ages will last. 
Every true Irish heart loves the name of O'Connell, 
The greatest of great Irishmen of the past.

Sells evening papers, 
On the Bowery for a 
Ball. 
The gang upon the corner, 
Not many days ago; 
Introduced me ye's can bet, 
As Patsy Kelly's Beau. 
Cnottus: 
Dandy Patsy Kelly, a 
Handy Andy lad, 
When I'm strolling with him the mashers get it had; 
Its naughty, but nicey, I'm still a 
friend to you, 
Go tell it to your Fairies, I 
am Patsy Kelly's Beau. 
He lives in Mulligan's building, 
Just up nine flights of stairs; 
He keeps his Father and Mother, 
And Silks and Satins wears. 
He takes care of his Brother, 
His Sister to Jail did go; 
Oh swell the story all around, 
I'm Patsy Kelly's Beau. 
Down around the bloody Fourth, 
He's a 
Politician tart; 
And after Election day, 
To Congress he will start. 
I 
live upon 5th Avenue, 
Wear a 
Gold Ring on my toe; 
The spellers tells the Daisies, 
I'm Patsiv Kelly's Beau,

RECOLLECTION. 
Written by Wm. J. SCANLON. 
When e'er I 
think. of bygone days, 
And the happy times we had 
At home in dear ould Ireland, 
It makes m3,- heart feel glad. 
When I 
think of my poor mild mother, 
And my father, ah ! how dear 
That sweet recollection is to me, 
how I 
wish they were here. 
But now I 
am old, my life is quickly passing, 
Soon I'll be laid away cold in my grave, 
And my mother and father's blessing 
remember. 
That blessing to me which they joyfully gave. 
I 
was but a 
boy fifteen years old 
When I 
was left alone, 
To wander through this wild world 
Without a 
friend or home. 
I 
had to earn my living, 
And that I 
did quite yell, 
So when I 
meet with good old friends, 
Those things I 
love to tell, 
(Chorus.)

panied with directions so plainly written, that, with

An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order

in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear-
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap -
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
cO'ne minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine ; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Biding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles.

with the book will make anybody at home in the hand-
