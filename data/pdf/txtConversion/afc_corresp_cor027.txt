[Internal memo from Alan Lomax to Harold Spivacke,
August 31, 1939]
To the Chief of the Music Division August 31, 1939
Music
I have read Dr. Corse's report on the works of the Florida W.P.A. in field recording with
much interest. Their approach seems sound and the technique described valid. I suggest
that all background material be recorded on good recording areas of the disc. It would be
worth-while: to ask singers of different types, ages, etc. to recite the words of a song or so
for the records; to question them before the mike about their own opinion of their songs,
of the factual or moral content of the song; to obtain biographies of singers with large or
extensive repertoires. In other words the more complete the documentation, the better I
feel sure, however, that if Mr. Morris has helped in the work, he has already made these
and other suggestions.
