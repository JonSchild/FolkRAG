Interview 
Sarah Filkins: This is Sarah Filkins, Interviewer, speaking with Laura Sanden Cabo, AIA, on 
Friday, July 10,  2020. Ms. Cabo and I were originally scheduled to meet at the offices of Walt 
Disney Imagineering in Glendale, California. Due to the covid pandemic we are now recording 
remotely. Today Laura Cabo is in her home office in Studio City, California and I am in my 
home office in Washington, DC. Good morning, Laura. Thank you for agreeing to share your 
story with us as part of the Library of Congress — American Folklife Center — Occupation 
Folklife Project funded by an Archie Green Fellowship. 
  
SF: So Laura if you could please tell us your full name and year of birth for archival reference.  
Laura Cabo: 
Laura Sanden Cabo and my year of birth is 1957. 
SF: And if you could please describe your current job and responsibilities. 
LC:  I am a Creative Portfolio Executive with The Walt Disney Imagineering which is part of 
The Walt Disney Company and my responsibilities are three-fold.  I am one of the creative 
leaders in Imagineering so I have responsibility for helping to lead and mentor people across the 
company. I am also a member of the leadership team in Design + Planning which is a studio 
within Imagineering which is comprised of a lot of the architects, and interior designers, and 
landscape architects, graphic designers. And then third-fold my position includes leading the 
creative design of our three new cruise ships. 
SF: And so we’ll get back to talking a little bit about or some more about Disney,  but let’s look 
back to growing up. When did you first become aware of architecture or the built environment? 
LC: Well, I don’t think it was something I knew the term architect. I think it was something 
more subliminal. My Dad was a career military officer who traveled all around the country 
actually and the world and so consequently we moved many times. I remember making a poster 
to celebrate his seventieth birthday which chronicled sort of with all of these dots across the US,                      
all of the places that we had lived and so I often tell people that I’ve moved at least eighteen 
times. I’ve kind of stopped counting. And I think that was key for me to really fall in love with 
the culture of a place. We were always moving to somewhere new and I always was excited 
about that. I mean I was of course sad to leave my schools and my friends but I knew there 
would always be new friends and there were new places to explore. And you know, whether we 
lived in San Francisco, or we lived in Charleston, South Carolina or in Boston, you know, each 
place was a different character and palette in history and future. So I think I just really became 
enamored with the fabric of the built environment within the natural landscape—all of that 
together just sort of creates the singular environment that you find when you go to a place.

SF: Did you know any women architects when you were in high school or college and what 
were you planning to study when you left high school? 
LC: Well I had always thought I would do something in the arts. As a little kid I remember 
being in second grade and my Mom took me to a Saturday class. It was some class that I think 
they had picked like a handful of kids who had artistic interests to go to this Saturday class. And 
I remember vividly we did an art project and it was about a four inch by eight inch piece of wood 
and I remember we had paint and we had some sort of maybe spray paint and I painted this sort 
of group of flowers and leaves 
[00:05:00] 
and my Mom still has it today and I remember thinking, Gosh, somebody thought that I had like 
artistic talent or something. And it made me feel good and it actually sort of opened up my mind 
to this is something that I enjoy and so it was something I always did. But particularly my uncle 
when I was in high school was quite a—and he’s still living today, he’s in his late eighties. He’s a 
fairly renowned portrait painter [John Howard Sanden], in fact, I think very renowned and he 
actually painted the official portrait that hangs in the White House of President and Laura Bush. 
But when he was in his, I guess he must have been in his forties, his wife who’s my aunt passed 
away suddenly and we were in Virginia and he was in Manhattan and he had a one year old 
daughter. And my Mom had a one-year old child too—so I have a very, very young brother. So 
they swapped me—they sent me to New York and they sent little Pammy down to Virginia to 
live with my parents. And I lived for the summer with my uncle, the portrait painter. So he took 
me all around that summer and I was sent there to keep him company after the loss of his wife 
and I did everything for him that he asked me to do. You know, I helped him get ready for his 
client’s sittings, the clients he was going to paint. I would go pick up the paints; I’d go get the 
frames; I’d go do all this stuff. And then I was only fifteen and he sent me to the Art Students 
League, which he was a member of, and so at age fifteen he sent me over there by myself with 
some paint and some canvas. And I walked into an art studio and saw the first naked body I’d 
ever seen (laughs) and painted—began to paint people. And I remember it was like also the year 
of the Watergate hearings and so I would come home at night and he would have the television 
on listening—it was the Watergate hearings on in the background—that was sort of our 
excitement. And then otherwise I would show him the painting I did that day and he would like 
give me all sorts of crits on how to do the fingers better, how to do the hand better, how to get the 
expression better but I was only fifteen. And it was quite amazing to have this like immersion 
into the art world. So when I went off to college I thought, Well you know, I love art, I really 
want to do something with it. But I wasn’t sure that I could be that life changing artist. I also 
loved travel, I loved culture, right—that was built into me from moving around my whole life. 
So I thought about maybe being a foreign diplomat. So I started studying all that kind of stuff 
like political science and then I thought maybe I should go to law school. And then when I was a 
junior and I was getting ready to graduate from college, I thought, Oh my gosh, I don’t think this 
is me. I don’t think I actually am a lawyer. And it was really hard. And it started eating away at 
me. And I went home and told my parents that I couldn’t do what I thought I was going to do and

my Dad said, “Well, what are you going to do?” (laughs) And I said, “I think, you know, I’ve 
always loved design, urban design, painting. I think maybe architecture.” And I don’t think I’d 
ever met an architect, ever, but I had read those books, Atlas Shrugged, you know all the Ayn 
Rand books, which were very much the fashion. I’m sure you read them. 
SF: Oh, yes! 
LC: And it sort of represented the fact that design was so important in people’s lives, you know, 
that design matters which is actually one of the jargons of the American Institute of Architects. 
But I’ve always thought that design does matter. It does matter. And so I just sort of decided then 
that, Okay - architecture. So it was quite late so I went to grad school where I had to get all of 
that architectural training. So that was a long road. 
[00:10:00] 
SF: But you—and you studied—and so your degree was in homebuilding? Is that right? 
LC: Yeah, so I had been pursuing political science and french with a minor in art and it was sort 
of the last two semesters of school. So I was at school at Trinity University in San Antonio, 
Texas and it’s a small school, two thousand students, it was—the closest thing I could find was 
homebuilding. And so I did as much as I could in that program and it was actually really 
interesting because it’s actually very different than architecture—very, very much about the sort 
of more practical side of how you become almost like a contractor and you build homes. So I had 
courses like surveying, which actually was super interesting that you’d get out there with the 
tripod and you’d survey things and you’d have your hard hat on and it just taught me sort of this 
whole different thing and I don’t know, maybe it made me interesting to a program of 
architecture. Here’s this sort of woman who has no background in architecture but you know, 
she’s had this home building training and she wants to draw and I don’t know—very much a 
generalist. And actually I think that that kind of thinking is really good for architecture. 
SF: That’s what a number of people I’ve interviewed have suggested—that undergraduates do a 
broad liberal arts education as opposed to focusing early on, so you kind of did a combination of 
both. 
LC: Yeah, and I think and there’s certainly—I mean any way that you get schooled in it is valid, 
right? There’s so many different ways to get there but the traditional way is that you know that 
you want to be an architect and you apply to a school of architecture and you get that five year 
degree. But I have to say, I do have a sentiment towards getting—sort of like learn about 
everything in the world because architecture is such a broad thing because when you become a 
practicing architect you’re really in charge of listening to people who probably know nothing 
about architecture. And you need to find a way to listen to what it is they want to achieve through 
design and how you can help bring that to life. And you need to be a good listener and I think the 
more you can be a broad thinker—that you can just sort of understand everything as much as you 
Laura Sanden Cabo Interview, July 10, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031

can from medicine to landscape to being a metal worker to whatever it is, I think it makes you a 
better listener. And it makes you more empathetic and I think the more empathetic you are as a 
designer, the better the design will be. 
SF: And you had—that provided you also with a basic foundation in construction to so you 
were maybe a little ahead of the game too. 
LC: Well it certainly gave me a respect for the practicalities of things. I mean, don’t know that 
people who know me really well would think that I’m the most practical person in the world. 
They may think that I sort of focus in that out-of-the-box sort of creative world. But actually at 
Imagineering now, at Walt Disney Imagineering, I feel like this traditional background where I 
became an architect in sort of the traditional architectural way and practiced designing buildings 
and things like that, gave me a really good foundation in the practicality of how we approach and 
how we execute these really incredible out-of-the-box projects at Imagineering. So and I think 
this kind of also—the generalist background that I had in my education I think also gives me the 
ability to work across the so many different parts of our company now here at Imagineering. 
SF: Well when you were then graduating from undergraduate and then looking at architecture 
schools, what were you thinking? Were you applying all over the country? 
LC: I was applying—it’s hard to remember back (laughs) then but I was applying all over the 
country and I remember I had to put a portfolio together and I remember it was—you know this 
was back before people  
[00:15:00] 
were even, like in architecture school, working on computers, right. Everything was done by 
hand and I remember having to photograph my blueprints myself and I think the things I 
submitted were pretty primitive and pretty raw and actually when I think about it, I think it’s 
actually a miracle that I got accepted anywhere. You know, the things were pretty raw. But I 
ended up going to the University of Minnesota which at the time was run by a man, Ralph 
Rapson, who was really quite a leader in the modern movement. He had been trained, I believe, 
at MIT, he worked at the Architect’s Collaborative which is one of the sort of famous iconic 
firms from the 50s and the 60s and he came back to teach and he ran the program at Minnesota. 
So he was quite iconic and it really was a privilege to be able to learn in that program. But you 
know, it was eye-opening to me because coming out of sort of the homebuilding program which 
really had a certain way of looking at things and then going into architecture, where it was, I 
would say, much more like—the problems given to you, the challenges, the props, you know an 
architect from the day one is just sort of taught to be heroic, to look at things at a vast scale, to 
not sort of box yourself in. 
SF: At that point what did you love about architecture when you were finishing that program? 
Was it design, was it construction, detailing, more urban design? What was really your passion at 
Laura Sanden Cabo Interview, July 10, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031

that point as you were launching your career and looking for a job? 
LC: Well, I think one of the main things was working with a group, being part of a group. You 
know, you were with your class and you worked together. It was almost like a design salon, 
right? You just lived and breathed architecture and design and creativity and you just you know 
had an insatiable appetite for everything design and that sort of esprit de corps that is so much 
part of architectural training, wherever you are, is really a wonderful thing because I think it—
you’re one-hundred and fifty percent in. You can’t be just seventy-five percent in. And I think 
there is that kind of way of working—you know, you stay up all night, you know, everyone talks 
about their all-nighters, you know because every project you have to work so you have nothing 
left. It is very emotional. It’s actually physically grueling and you do it together and I think that 
that’s something that sets you up for life to just have this kind of work ethic. And I think also, 
having a tough skin—you get very emotionally involved. I mean every artist does with what 
you’re doing, right? Art is a subjective thing, architecture is a subjective thing. You’re creating 
this beautiful but also functional thing, right, that hopefully brings other people’s goals and 
aspirations alive. And yours are in there too of course but I think that esprit de corps is something 
that travels with you the rest of your life as an architect. And what did you ask me? I tend to just 
keep going on and on. You asked me sort of what I, well I loved that so. But I love the creative 
aspect of it. The technical aspect of it—that doesn’t naturally comes to me. Like my husband 
who’s also an architect—like I always say if we put the two of us together, we’d make like the 
world’s best architect. It would cover both sides of it, you know. So he can figure out how the 
most beautiful detail, that flashing detail, for that building’s facade will just absolutely shine so I 
can do that but I’m not that person. So I’m more the front end thinker, the sort of—I love the sort 
of big  
[00:20:00] 
thinking. You know how—and I love the storytelling. I love how you link everything through 
story. And I really prided myself in a lot of the firms that I worked for—and I didn’t work for 
that many—I worked a long time at a couple of firms which prided themselves deeply in telling 
stories and I think that really helped me also once I got to Imagineering because that’s core to 
everything we do. 
SF: Yes, I imagine. Did you—were you drawing on computer when you were in school or were 
you still… 
LC: No 
SF: Okay, so that didn’t happen until you were out in the workplace. 
LC: Oh, exactly. There were in school, you drew everything by hand, and which is also 
probably why we had to stay up all night all the time because these drawings took forever. And 
you know, we had those electric erasers which of course you thought were state of the art. And I

just remember you know you have to lift the eraser and then you turn it on and it erases the mylar 
and you get all of that you know—it’s just—yeah it was a different world—and then when I 
started work at RTKL once I graduated. So RTKL in Baltimore—that was where all of the 
sudden like we didn’t really—I think we had computer classes at school and you took them if 
you were really like into that but there was no sort of feeling of—oh, that was the way of the 
future like that just wasn’t in the academic program at that time. So when I started working, there 
was literally a separate part of the floor that was all—it was a raised floor and it had walls all 
around it and that’s where the computer people sat. And there was just this special elite group of 
people that just translated all of our hand-drawn drawings at RTKL into computer drawings. So 
that was a very different time from now where now designs start even on all of these platforms 
on the computer, you know. And so learning how to navigate all those programs and lead people 
who are all working in this way, I mean, that—there’s just been such a transformational change 
in terms of how you create a design and push it through the pipeline and then build something. 
You know, I think of like my favorite building in the whole world—at least where I’ve been to is 
the Sagrada Familia, the cathedral by Antonio Gaudi in Spain. And you know, that was drawn by 
hand and it’s one of the most fantastical buildings that anyone could ever see. And when you see 
it and it’s so organic and the engineering of it is just unbelievable and yet there are many, many 
unbelievable buildings that were figured out without the benefit of the computer but the 
computer allows us to do just so much more. Like from the get-go to imagine things three-
dimensionally so it’s just astounding how it’s changed.  
SF: So did you then learn the computer and then you used it while you were at RTKL or at 
Gund? 
LC: You know, I was probably that group of architects where you either made that shift or you 
didn’t. So my husband, Gary, he—I remember we were working actually in Boston—it was after 
that—all of us at RTKL, I think most of the people that came out of school with me and we were 
working there really drew by hand. It was sort of a hand process and then there was this separate 
process of people who executed it into computer drawings. So it was sort of after that in the mid-
eighties when we went up to Boston to work, my husband and I. We got married and we went to 
Boston, that was his home town, and that’s really where you kind of had to make that decision to 
either learn the computer programs or not. And I never really had the opportunity because I was 
always pushing the project, like on the front end of the project, or leading the project, setting up 
the brainstorm,  
[00:25:00] 
desk critting, pushing the design through with the team, so I never actually did. It’s actually kind 
of astounding but where like my husband is now sitting twenty feet away from me working safe 
at home in the pandemic and he has the full Revit models going on right now. And I spend my 
day now in the pandemic talking to people all day long and looking at drawings and looking at 3-
D models and collaborating across many different entities. So we have very different paths in a 
way.

SF: When you were just out of school and you started out at RTKL, and I think you were there 
for three years, what projects did you work on there and what was your role? 
LC: Wow, well that was pretty heavy times you know, to come out of architecture school. 
Typically I feel like, Oh my gosh, as late, so many people have come out of architecture school 
and it’s some huge recession and nobody gets a job. But when I graduated, I think it was in 83, 
we actually had interviews where people flew us to interviews. It just wasn’t something that 
normally happened or that we were trained for and then you know, offered a job. And I recall 
because I had a masters degree, I was awarded five hundred dollars more than the person who 
didn’t have a masters degree. And so that was a big deal. That was a really big deal. And then 
starting at RTKL, coming right out of school and sort of being given like big, big, like leading 
design projects to work on, it was quite surprising. And maybe it’s because they were such a big 
firm and there was so much work to do that they very readily would give you a wide, wide berth 
to do things. So one of the first projects I worked on was a hotel in the Caribbean and that was 
amazing to get right out of school—you know you come from a world of living off of bread and 
apples and peanut butter and you’re able to get on airplanes and go down to the Caribbean and 
work on the design of a major hotel. And then go to Chicago to meet with the hotel developer 
and then the other arm of the developers you know, with offices in Canada and London. So that 
was pretty amazing to be able to work on projects like that. And a lot of them were also mixed-
use and certainly retail oriented. You know RTKL was—has always been well known for their 
retail expertise. And I always found that very interesting to be able to look at such large-scale 
projects that impact lots of people. I think actually my husband and I worked together on a very 
large shopping mall in New Orleans and so it was a normal thing that we worked on projects all 
around the country. 
SF: You were getting to travel, you were getting involved in different cultures, you were 
getting to draw so… 
LC: Yeah, it was pretty amazing. Yeah, I feel very lucky. I don’t know. Yeah, it feels like maybe 
I’ve had the luck of maybe being in places at the right time. 
SF: And then you decided to move to Boston—so did you have jobs before you went there or 
this was something you were just moving to a place and then you would see what happened? 
LC: Yeah well so when you’re young that’s in everybody’s DNA, right, that you’re probably 
going to move around? You’re going to try different things. And my husband was—is from 
Boston and Boston is a great architect’s town. Well, it’s beautiful architecturally. It’s got so much 
history. It also has the advantage of youth. They’re so many institutions of higher ed there so the 
place is just infused with college kids. So there’s this kind of freshness that also comes with 
everything, this kind of vitality,  
[00:30:00]

so I thought that would be great. Let’s move up there. His family’s there. My family was always 
someplace else and you could never quite count on, you know, they were never going to be there 
for a long time. So we would go up to Boston. So after a lifetime of moving around, we went to 
Boston and we were there for at least twenty-five years which was very different for me—
someone who had moved every couple of years. And we interviewed—I think we made some 
trips up there. We interviewed with a number of firms and we got jobs and then we decided—we 
let RTKL know and we moved up there and then embarked on our new life in Boston. 
SF: And what intrigued you about Gund [Partnership]? 
LC: Well I actually had wanted to work with Graham Gund for a long time. I being in school 
you—every time “Architectural Record” or any of those magazines came out—you just couldn’t 
wait to get them and you just completely consumed them. And Graham at the time was you 
know, emerging in his career and I remember he had the Shapleigh House—was on the cover of 
one of the [Architectural] Record issues when I was in grad school and I thought, Oh! I just 
absolutely sort of fell in love with it. It was this sort of very playful dynamic assemblage of 
buildings which was a house and it was set in Cape Cod and it was modern but also playful and 
warm. And I just sort of loved his approach to architecture and I remember I wrote his office 
when I was in grad school about maybe working for him in the summer or maybe when I was 
going to graduate and I got that very sort of nice form letter back that you know, “Sorry we’re 
not interested. We don’t have anything with your skills set at this time.” So eventually when I 
went to Boston I worked for Kallmann McKinnell & Wood [Architects, Inc.] when I first got 
there who—a brilliant, a brilliant firm run by Gerhard Kallmann and Michael McKinnell and 
Michael McKinnell just recently passed away. And I was there for a very short time but they’re 
very iconic and well known for the design of the Boston, the Government Center and you know 
it is very kind of  Brutalist modern piece of work. It’s beautiful but it’s one of those buildings 
architects love it and probably the general public doesn’t. And anyway so I was there for about 
nine months but I still had this—and it was you know very sort of a cerebral place to work and I 
still felt this sort of—this pull to Gund. The work was a bit different and I think just more in my 
kind of mindset and so I did—I was able to get into Gund and had an interview and was given a 
position there so that actually turned into something that was so comfortable and then for over 
twenty-five years. Graham—I mean he ended up being one of my most influential mentors in my 
career and life. And he taught me so much but we really were like, sort of, had a kinship over the 
way that we approached life. He loves art; he’s an art collector. He sees things emotionally and 
sort of in color and sort of through intuition which is really how I like to approach life. 
SF: He also approaches things very collaboratively doesn’t he as well? And that’s sort of your
—one of your… 
LC: Yes, and he was always very empowering, I mean very respectful, very—you would have 
design crits—the thing he loved more than anything was just sitting down at a desk and 
scribbling with you and he just, he loved—

[00:35:00] 
I remember the first project I worked on. So this was the funny thing is I had been enamored 
with this house that was on the cover of the magazine when I was in school, the Shapleigh 
House. And when I started there which must have been, I don’t know maybe a decade later after 
seeing that house, I actually worked on the second house for that same client, for the Shapleigh’s 
in St. Louis and that was an incredible way to start. I mean working on a single family house is 
such an intimate thing. But literally making little clay models and I remember the house that we 
were designing for them in St. Louis was like their year-round residence and it was actually for 
them as they were retiring and so it was a house that was really important to them. And we had 
this idea of all of these sort of wings and sort of little towers that were—I remember I had a 
picture ripped out of a magazine of St. Basils. And of course the end product didn’t look like a 
Russian basilica but it just shows how far out there that you can think and then how you derive 
inspiration from things and bring them into a design. But that was wonderful and I would fly out 
to St. Louis and we would have design meetings in their house and then during construction I 
would spend the night in their house. I’d spend a few days with them. We’d have dinner together. 
We’d go to the site together. It was really a very different way of working on something probably 
that a lot of people don’t experience. 
SF: What a great first project and introduction to a firm and to that firm’s culture. Were there 
other mentors in addition to Graham Gund? Or were there any women architects that you were 
admiring at that point? 
LC: Well, yeah, when I think about that there have been—I mean obviously because 
architecture traditionally has been more of a male centered profession. Typically, I’ve always 
been one of the few women in the room or the only woman in the room or the only woman on 
the team. But that’s changed a lot over the past few years. And working with Graham, you know 
Graham was someone who actually worked very well with women. And I think it’s because of 
that sort of emotional place that a lot of women come from. I don’t mean to say there’s a sort of 
— that we all come from the same cloth. We don’t at all. We’re all totally different. But he—to 
him, he completely would give you the reins, you know, that you can go lead the project. You 
can figure out how to bring everybody together and how to get at what are the goals for the 
project, what is the vision? And then he also though is very strong, looking at it critically himself 
and working with you. So don’t make any mistake of that but I think that he—I always felt that 
he—it didn’t matter woman, man, ethnicity, whatever. He just wanted the best ideas and so I 
think he was very supportive that way. And I would have some hard, some very, very hard clients 
cuz as I got more expert at being an architect and sort of with my subject matter expertise, the 
projects would get bigger. And certainly, I think at Gund being sort of a generalist firm—you 
know, we’re not a firm that did like one type of market sector. There’s a lot of firms that do that. 
But Gund was very much a generalist firm, or is a generalist firm. So we often would get a 
project because we had never done that type before and the client wanted us to bring something 
fresh to it. So I always felt every project I worked on, was a little bit scary because I might not 
have worked on that type of project before. So it was always a big challenge but that’s something

I love about architecture is that every project that you work on, you don’t have to be an expert in 
that thing. You just have to be expert at how you pull sort of the goals and things out  
[00:40:00] 
of people so that you can design to their needs. And it’s exciting because you learn all about 
whatever that environment is about, you know, whether it’s—I’m thinking, I’ve done a senior 
living community that was lauded as one of the most progressive in the country at the time which 
was for the Judson Corporation, Chagrin Falls, Ohio. We were hired to do that. We’d never done 
that before. I remember we were hired to do the National Association of Realtors Headquarters 
building in Washington, DC and I’d never worked on a headquarters building before and it was a 
twelve story tall building. I’d never done that before. And it was also the first “green” building in 
Washington, DC and I certainly had never done that before because that was right on the leading 
edge of all of that. So I guess, I find all of that to be really exciting and I think that comes out of 
like my itch to move and like having lived all over the place. I love that kind of newness that 
comes with a new project and you can throw yourself into it and just sort of consume it. 
SF: And also that you know that you have the capabilities to find the appropriate resources and 
fit in and I mean just coming from your being a “Navy brat” and having to move so often you are 
really able to tackle new projects as if, I guess, it was like another move and you knew you could 
do it, just different criteria. 
LC: Well, I mean I certainly like everybody get that angst, you know, where I wonder like, Oh 
my gosh, how can I do this? I’m going to fail. How can I do this? Am I—people are going to find 
out I don’t know everything. But I don’t know, I think in life, if you’re excited about things or 
you’re curious and you ask other people to help. And you know, “Help me figure this out.” You 
can solve anything. I think when I first started out on this creative journey as like a high school 
kid who just like painted all the time, like painted by myself and contemplated that world. I think 
I’m better suited to the collaborative world of design you know because it’s to me, there’s so 
much context to respond to and you have a mission, like you’re trying to solve some challenges 
and I’ve always loved that. I love how design can help change the world, you know like even 
thinking at Gund where I became really expert in performing arts and arts buildings of all kinds. 
So I loved it technically like understanding all of the ventilation you need for the lithography 
process verses painting and all of that. But what I really loved was the fact that when I was really 
in the midst of  a lot of different arts projects on campuses around the country, that it was the 
local academia, the colleges, the universities, were recognizing how these creative parts of their 
program were something that could really help their entire student body have a more open mind 
towards problem solving. And so you were’t just doing an art building, you were doing a 
building that you hoped you could somehow through urban design get everybody on campus to 
walk through, to be part of, and then to maybe have that spark of, “Oh, you know I’m trying to 
solve this mechanical engineering problem of how I get someone to the moon but you know I—
talking to my friend over here in the lithography lab…” Anyway, I think that is super exciting. To 
the whole world, like we don’t know right now during the pandemic, we don’t know the answers

to tomorrow.  So you’ve got to be nimble. You’ve got to be able to think on your feet of how to 
solve things. And so that’s what I love about architecture sort of  
[00:45:00] 
as what you study. It teaches you to think creatively and problem solve and I think in the world, 
no matter what you do, whether you’re my son who’s in computer science or my other son who 
is a first year resident, in a pandemic by the way, that the more you can think on your feet and 
creatively think, the better you’re going to be able to react to all of these things that get thrown 
our way, because we don’t know what’s coming our way. 
SF: What were some of the other projects you were working on while you were with Gund.  
LC: Well, so a lot of those arts projects which I just dearly loved and of course every once in a 
while there’d be that house, you know, like a house a year—I wouldn’t work on a house every  
year but every once in a while you’d work on a house and that was just such, such fun. And we 
also had a client that came to us around 1991 which was Disney. And we were one of a couple of 
firms that sort of entered a competition for a resort and we got the job. And that sort of led us 
through many decades of working with Disney on the design of some of their mixed-use 
properties and resorts around the world and it was really eye-opening and exciting. There was a 
gentleman at the time who I still keep in contact with. His name is Wing Chao and he had come 
from Harvard, the design school there, and was an architect. And he started working with Disney 
and he really led their program where they went from their theme park to the creation of these 
resorts. There had been—obviously there had been resorts and the hotels that had been there that 
predated Wing, but Wing within this period, which I think is affectionately called the “Disney 
Decade” where there was this real interest particularly with Michael Eisner at the time who was 
at the helm of The Walt Disney Company, in leveraging design to really create these sort of 
really immersive resorts—to just push them in even a more immersive way. So that you’re in the 
theme park but you’re in a hotel and it’s all breathing Disney and Wing was really at the helm                        
of a lot of that. And so it was amazing to work with him and he is also sort of the largest 
influence/mentor in my life in addition to Graham. I worked with him at Graham Gund on many 
projects, probably about nine projects and traveled the world with him and he taught me so 
much. I mean the idea of how Disney obviously is all about storytelling and so I think he really 
actually infused that in Gund. Everyone at Gund—we would work on these projects for Disney 
and we would literally like almost dress it, like dress it and we’d decorate the conference room 
like you would live and breathe it and the rest of the firm could see that. And I think the rest of 
the firm also picked up on all of these things that we learned from working on the Disney 
projects. I mean being able to apply the meaningful storytelling where it matters. Their projects 
are huge, and now I say our projects because I am now there. But our projects are immense and 
so you have to look at very smartly sort of placing the storytelling so that it’s guest facing and 
has the most impact. And then you have to find ways to be extremely efficient, extremely smart 
with how you execute the balance of it. And you have to be extremely innovative. So all of those 
things wrapped together, we began to live and breathe that, through the eyes of Wing Chou and 
Laura Sanden Cabo Interview, July 10, 2020

Wing is retired now and he was recognized as a Disney Legend which is an amazing recognition 
of all of his 
[00:50:00] 
incredible leadership. 
SF: How would you describe—how was it different working with say Disney as a client 
opposed to your more traditional architecture clients? 
LC:  It is very different because The Walt Disney Company and particularly Imagineering, 
which is the part—The Walt Disney Imagineering is the part that I’m in—is made up of such 
world-class experts in everything—everything. We always say that as sort of our intro. We’re 
made up of over a hundred and forty disciplines and we like to stay within a five minute walk on 
our campus—you can find—you can go into R&D [Research and Development] and you can 
find robotics engineers and aerospace engineers and you can walk over into our Scene Paint and 
find the most incredible painters and colorists and we’ve got architects and interior designers and 
creative designers. And I mean you just name it, we have it. Storytellers, I mean we have an 
entire department of storytellers and every project has a story—someone from Story 
Development is on your project anthem is all—it’s pretty rich, it’s just—I always say, “It’s a 
banquet.” You know, you have to go to the banquet and you just need to make sure you try 
everything and it’s involved in every project. So how is it different? Most clients come to you 
and they don’t really understand design perhaps or the built environment but Disney does and 
they’re as much designing it as you are. So if you’re an external firm working with them, you’re 
partners, together. 
SF: Did you ever envision yourself working for Disney when you were at Gund because you 
had been at Gund for a long time, and you were a partner and loving Boston so what took you to 
California and making that transition to actually working with only Disney? 
LC:  Well, I always sort of envisioned myself continuing to work at Gund and it was something 
very important to me—the firm—I always—it really sort of met all of my dreams and 
aspirations. Really the culture—it always roughly was around fifty people, that was our sweet 
spot. We got up to a hundred at one point but it was really this family of designers and it was all 
about design and art and emotion and it was perfect for me. So I really had no intention to leave. 
And actually learning about Imagineering, I only knew so much because we were busy working 
with Wing and with Imagineering but it is an organization for many, many reasons that has to 
retain a huge amount of a kind of secrecy about it. And now that I’m at Imagineering that is 
something that we do talk a lot about. So there are a lot of people out there that don’t know about 
Imagineering as a career option and I think particularly within the world of architecture and how 
architecture is practiced. I think a lot of people don’t know about it so I think that’s something 
that we talk about at Imagineering—is how to sort of open up a bit of that curtain so that people 
can see this amazing process, this amazing opportunity to design and to tell stories through 
Laura Sanden Cabo Interview, July 10, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031
15
design. So I think if you grow up in California or in Florida you know a lot about Imagineering 
and if you’re a heavy-duty fan you probably do cuz you’ve gone out and you’ve sort of sought 
out like—who does this? Who designs these things? How do these things get designed? But I 
think there’s a lot of people who don’t so I certainly  
[00:55:00] 
didn’t grow up with it and I learned a certain amount working with Wing and what I did learn, I 
loved. And I got a phone call at one point where the question was, “Would I be interested in a 
position at Imagineering?” And I had never thought of that and I was really intrigued and it kind 
of stopped me in my tracks. And I went out there to see it and I went out there a couple of times 
and I was really struck. I was able to, sort of, see more behind the curtain and I—it’s this vastly 
larger organization, thousands of people and then also it’s embedded within The Walt Disney 
Company which is even thousands of more people. And amazing that this just, sort of, the level 
of expertise that you could collaborate with and sort of the scale of impact you could have. I just 
thought, Wow, if I’m ever going to try anything like that—to just change sort of my life and the 
other thing was this is a huge change like going from sort of a traditional way of practicing 
architecture within an architecture firm, right? To this, being in the entertainment business and 
within The Walt Disney Company was a huge change but I felt so drawn to it—it’s even hard 
now to even imagine like how I made that change but I’m happy I did. I would never give back 
all of those years at Gund, those were amazing. And now to have this other opportunity in just 
sort of a very different way to do what I’m doing now is—is—I don’t know. Well, I feel like it 
took—I felt like it was jumping off a diving board—it was scary but it was exciting. 
SF: What was your first project at Disney? 
LC: Well, I came into Walt Disney Imagineering to lead their Global Architecture and Interiors 
Group within the Design + Planning Group. So we have many, many groups but we’re all 
Imagineers is what we like to say—this sort of—this group of almost Navy Seal like folks with 
all of these different expertises that come together. And it is really wonderful that we get to be in 
a way in this bubble. It is the first and only think tank founded by Walt Disney. He started the 
studios and the film business and he had this amazing impact and then he had that idea to create 
this place for families to go spend their free time together, which became the resorts. And to do 
that he almost had to sort of set up this thing on the side which became Imagineering where he 
brought together this diverse group of people to work on this sort of—what people thought this 
crazy vision was. And that has stayed true, to Imagineering all these years now and it is fantastic. 
You come in brainstorming, thinking outside the lines is something we revere and treasure and 
it’s—so you work on projects but you work on collaborative things within the company and 
outside the company. I love that. So getting back to your first question, I came in to lead 
architecture and interiors within the Design + Planning Group. And then that was a great 
foundation for me. I was responsible for bringing in talent from the outside and I feel very proud 
about the people I was able to find and bring in from traditional architecture and interiors 
backgrounds. And but it was also a great foundation to really learn for a couple of years, before I 
Laura Sanden Cabo Interview, July 10, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031
16
was asked to do my current role, to really learn about how you navigate such a large company 
and understand how you work with intellectual property and what is a project process because it 
is so very different. I mean there’s show sets, there’s show lighting, there’s just— 
[01:00:00] 
when you look at engineering on a project. Like our engineering of what the—the engineering 
must be behind the scenes which makes it—there’s a need for it to be even more innovative and 
creative almost in some ways because you’ve got to have a way to have things stand up but you 
don’t want to see it because you’re telling a story. The story is everything. So I think that was 
really good training because I was able to get to know all of these different disciplines and get to 
understand and listen. I think that was the most important thing, to just listen. You know I always 
wondered, Why at Disney don’t they use real materials? How come they don’t use stone and how 
come they don’t use—you know we have all of these scenic painters that come in. Well, it’s 
because of the narrative. If you just use like stone from a quarry and put that in on your Main 
Street or on your, let’s say, your Galaxy’s Edge, which is our newly opened Star Wars attraction. 
Well, that would not tell the level of story and emotion that you need your guests to feel. We 
don’t have the luxury of recreating like the entirety of Venice, right. If we’re going to recreate 
Venice in our park, it’s going to be for a hundred feet and you’ve gotta have this heightened 
emotion and this sort of—this Cliff Notes of it but it has to have authenticity and it’s got to be 
beautiful and it’s gotta be emotional. So scene painting is something where we come in with 
crafts and material. So the crafts—like there is so much craft in that—the execution of our three-
dimensional storytelling. It’s amazing. 
SF: So do you start out with a basic task of we are going to build this exhibit or this particular 
area of a theme park and then the story has already been developed and then it’s up to you to 
execute it or are you involved with the story right from the beginning? How does it work? 
LC: Yeah, so all of out teams led by Portfolio Executives like myself are all tasked with 
creating this story. And we are so collaborative. And so of course you know, I think there’s a 
word out there “blue-sky” which I’m sure it’s coined by many people but it’s something intrinsic 
within The Walt Disney Company and certainly within Walt Disney Imagineering which 
connotes this sort of brainstorm mode on a project. And so that is so important. So there of 
course is always a business need for a project and then there are strategic needs and within that is 
also the stories, looking at the stories that we’re telling within our park. Are they balanced? Is 
there a story that’s more relevant today? And of course all of that applies to our cruise ships too. 
The thing that makes our cruise ship stand out from all the other cruise lines out there—that 
we’re really chiefly the main cruise line for families. And then Disney Cruise Line obviously, 
we’re taking our wealth of stories and we’re bringing them alive on our ship. So that is definitely 
part of the process—you start with the story first, you think about and you work with writers and 
designers and people who can draw things and then people who are innovating and thinking 
technically about things. It’s just a broad spectrum so I think we’re very famous for that and it’s 
something that we do as a part of every project and brainstorms all along the way. And you take 
Laura Sanden Cabo Interview, July 10, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031
17
you projects and the process that you created and you involve lots and lots of people because The 
Walt Disney brand—it’s very important to our success that we take care of it. And I think that’s 
why we have lasted over all of this time. We’re an evergreen firm and it’s amazing how we’ve 
been able to sort of transcend time and transcend how the world has actually changed but there’s 
still this emotional connection 
[01:05:00] 
to our brand and so we are sort of the protectors of the brand and so we’re both a client and a 
design firm. We’re an owner and an operator. I think that’s another way that we’re very different. 
When you’re an outside architecture firm working for a typical client—well Disney is all of 
those complex things. So we’re an owner operator; we’re a designer and so that makes us 
extremely passionate about everything that we do. 
SF: You were then given the opportunity to be the Portfolio Creative Executive for the three 
new class ships for Disney Cruise Lines—so launching in 2021, 2022 and 2023. So designing a 
cruise ship is that—are you essentially given a blank canvas and then you take it from there and 
it’s up to you all to just brainstorm and develop your own storyline? Is each ship different? How 
do you begin on a project that large where they’re actually—I guess the ships are under 
construction now? 
LC: Yeah, so well, that was also certainly nothing that was ever in my brain. If you asked me 
when I arrived at Imagineering or maybe asked me when I was in graduate school, “Will you be 
designing cruise ships?” I mean that was something that never entered my brain. And again it’s 
something that I really find amazing, like being an architect. I just feel that that background of 
design—just makes—it can make you prepared to sort of take on any kind of challenge. So and 
again it’s all about finding the right people and the right experts and working with them and 
certainly we have them in spades. And I certainly didn’t come on to the cruise ship project at 
ground zero. I mean we, although we’re a small cruise ship company compared to others that 
have thirty ships or sixty ships or whatever. Within the scheme of things there might be around 
three hundred and forty cruise ships in the world. And of course there are many different 
definitions of what makes a cruise ship but it’s sort of on that larger scale and we have four. We 
have only four but we’re very recognized providing just these amazing family fun experiences 
and I think people are always surprised when they come on board, or maybe not surprised. I 
think they do expect this—that we deliver at a very high level. It’s not a—it’s one of our 
premium products. I think the first time I walked on board when I joined the team about two and 
a half years ago, I was astounded by the permanence of it, by the size of the vessel and by the 
elegance of it. And of course my mentor, Wing Chou had actually worked on our four, first cruise 
ships and so it’s actually again another source of astounding thing that I followed in his footsteps 
in a way. So that is also quite a privilege and it’s a huge, huge thing. I don’t want to ruin what 
he’s done. He did an amazing thing and the team that I work with is amazing and I believe we’re 
doing incredible things. So we’re taking this—what is already an incredible  product  within  our 
company and I really hope, I do believe, that we’re doing something as equally special with it in 
Laura Sanden Cabo Interview, July 10, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031
18
a different way. So it’s quite a privilege and it’s also quite a surprise that I’ve ended up now 
leading the design of cruise ships. And you know, I had never been on a cruise prior to taking 
this on and the Disney Cruise Line Company has been taking care of their cruise ships for all of 
these years and they’ve had all of these thoughts and wonderful brainstorms on what to do with 
the next three ships. So I’m just lucky I came on at a point where I could still help in that regard 
and that’s been an amazing journey. So I think I’m really proud of everything that we’re doing. 
[01:10:00] 
SF: Did you get to take your family on a cruise when you first were looking at this project? 
LC: Oh, sure, yeah and that’s something that our team misses so much because whenever the 
cruise ships are in port, it’s just—it was so easy—if you’re in Florida you go over to Cape 
Canaveral and you can go on board while the ship has just stopped in. It’s letting our guests off 
and it’s cleaning up before the next guests come on board and then of course one of our cruise 
ships was often in San Diego so I’m in California and I have a—there’s a small portion of our 
team is here and we have a larger portion of the team in Florida and then of course our ships are 
built elsewhere in the world and we have a team embedded in Europe as well. And so it’s quite a 
global enterprise which is again something that was of interest to me. Coming from Gund to 
Disney—that opportunity to sort of work at that global level—that was—that is also an amazing 
opportunity as well. So working across all these time zones is exhausting but it is—to be able to 
work with such a diverse group of people not only from their backgrounds but also from their 
cultures. That has been a true gift too.  
SF: Yes, I heard you jumped into what was it—the North Sea with your team at some point. 
LC: Yeah as part of working on cruise we engage firms from all over the world working with 
us, amazingly talented firms, expert in design and particularly expert in the design of cruise ships 
because it’s—their floating in the ocean—and the weather takes quite a beating on everything so 
there’s only certain materials you can use and the details have to be very different so anyway it 
takes us oftentimes to places that I had never thought that I would have the opportunity in the 
course of doing business to go to. So we were in Oslo for some meetings and as a sort of team 
building exercise we decided at the end of a really long day that it would be great—we all had 
our sort of gym clothes on because we didn’t anticipate any of this—that we would just all hold 
hand and jump into the North Sea. That was really great. And hopefully, we’ll do it again 
sometime when we get past this pandemic. 
SF: Well that takes real leadership to get your team to jump into the North Sea. 
LC: Yeah, so but that is—that truly—being able to work across all of these cultures and with 
people from all over the world—I mean there’s just—when you work on a Disney project there’s 
just so many people involved and it really is—it’s just mind-boggling. There’s never a dull 
moment. 
Laura Sanden Cabo Interview, July 10, 2020

SF: What have been some of your greatest challenges and what have you learned whether it 
was at Disney or Gund or architecture school or RTKL? 
LC: Well, I think it’s having enough confidence in yourself that no matter what you’re faced 
with that you’re just as smart as the next person and that you can figure it out and I think 
particularly being a woman working in a man’s—traditionally a man’s field—that that, I think 
that a lot of women struggle with that and you know also raising a family as well and making 
sure that you’re being a good mom but also balancing sort of really tough assignments. I think 
that that has been hard for sure and there’s been some moments where I really needed to be home 
but I also had to be at work and then moments when I was home but I needed to be at work. I 
feel like you’re always caught in the middle. 
SF: How did you balance that? 
LC: Well, I would say again 
[01:15:00] 
it was sort of confidence also that you can’t be consumed with guilt. I know I hear a lot of 
women say, “I feel guilty being at work," or “I feel guilty being at home.” It’s like you’re caught 
within the crosshairs. I think you have to be confident that if you’re a happy person in life that 
your family will be happy, your family will see you happy, your family will see what you do and 
hopefully be inspired by that so I made choices, right, and they may have been different than 
others. Everyone has to make their own choices. I think also having a workplace that’s always 
been appreciative of these things. I think that’s certainly something that’s so important in today’s 
workplace particularly like even pre-pandemic—the fact that we are a more global society and 
that you’re often called upon to work at very odd hours just because of that and that being to able 
work from home, being able to juggle things that are important. Your family’s important so if 
you’ve got happier employees, you’re going to get better work so I think that’s very important. 
SF: Have you experienced gender equity challenges whether in architecture school, or on the 
construction site or working with different clients or employers? 
LC: Sure, I mean I think, yes, of course. I also like to think that I have also—I’ve had a lot of 
great opportunities so I think in the end it hasn’t mattered if I’ve been a woman or not or been 
young or not. You know I think in the end it’s what you do, right, that allows you these 
opportunities but certainly I would say so—I have stories that I’m sure you have as well. I have 
vivid memories of being with a boss and driving the rental car and having him say, “Hey, back 
up,” and sort of looking at the back end of this woman or being in a meeting with contractors and 
having them call you “Honey” just because they have nothing, they don’t know what else to call 
you maybe. But all of the sudden it just sort of lets the air out of all of your sails. You know, 
you’re a smart young woman and you know what you’re talking about. So certainly that’s been 
Laura Sanden Cabo Interview, July 10, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031
20
tough and often negotiating having a family and being able to be sort of a symbol within your 
firm that, “Hey you can lead a firm and you can also have kids and you can go home and see 
their soccer game but yet you can still perform at a high level.” You know, I think at Walt Disney 
Imagineering when I got here one of our major executive leaders also was a Dad in my son’s 
school and his son and my son played basketball together. And so I’m brand new to California, 
I’m brand new to Imagineering and of course my son is brand new—I’ve sort of lifted him out of 
his place of birth and his sort of, his whole health and well-being and so I really felt that first 
year in particular I needed to be there at his games or whatever he was doing. And so I remember 
I left work early one day and I went to the basketball game and there also was this amazing 
executive leader and it made me think even more of him. Like he left to go watch his son play 
basketball and I’m sure he went back to work and he’d probably gotten up at 4 a.m. but that was 
great. I mean he was a Dad—he’s a Dad. 
SF: Yes, yes.  What about architecture brings you the most joy?  What are some of the most 
rewarding aspects? 
LC: Well, I mean, I think as a person  
[01:20:00] 
who travels around the world and experiences cities, I really am just impacted visually by this 
beautiful world that we live in and sort of seeing the beauty of Paris [France] verses Oslo 
[Norway] verses downtown LA [Los Angeles] verses my neighborhood—I mean wherever you 
go it’s a beautiful world and I think that is one of the most impactful things to me is just—we 
live in a world that’s made naturally and is unbelievably beautiful. Flying over that—flying over 
it that’s one of my sort of pet things that I love to do is take photographs from airplanes of the 
landscape. I think the patterns, the landscape that nature makes below are incredible. I’m just 
fascinated by them but I guess visually—I just am a visual person and I am just always 
awestruck by my environment whether it’s natural or built. And then I think the other thing that 
maybe, because there’s a lot of people of the world that don’t maybe haven’t even heard the 
word architect, you know, and what does it mean? And I think—you know, sometimes I’ve run 
into people that think architects are people who just sort of make these boxes, you know like 
maybe designed the dentist office and the grocery store and they don’t understand that 
architecture is sort of about being this generalist that can sort of understand you, understand 
everybody, put it all together and then design something that makes a place more special than 
you could every imagine. That’s the thing that I’ve loved over the years—is when you’ve worked 
on a project and then it opens and then someone says, “Oh my goodness this is way more than I 
ever thought," or way more than I ever dreamed.  And I feel like that’s what designers can do, 
that’s what design does. Design can actually add magic. It’s about making magic. 
SF: What do you see as your legacy? I know, it’s a little early to be talking about legacy but if 
you were thinking about what your legacy would be.

LC: Well I would hope that on all of the projects that I’ve worked on you know whether I was 
the emerging designer or the leader—that I just would hope everybody would look back on that 
and think, “That was fun working with her.” You know, that that was a fun experience. I tend to
—I like to hug people. That’s not quite PC [politically correct] these days or in the pandemic. 
But I really feel like my teams are my family too, my extended family. So I really—I really care 
about them and I care about what they think and I care about what they do. And I hope, I hope 
that I’ve helped make people that are designers—I hope that I’ve helped highlight to others their 
talent. I hope that I’ve empowered them. Anyway, I hope that I’ve been a great mentor. And then 
on the design side it’s sort of what I said earlier, I just hope that whatever the project was, or the 
assignment was, that we’ve been able to give people that Ah-ha moment, that sort of emotional 
inspiration. I mean life is really—I don’t know, I feel like I want to go from exhilarating 
experience to exhilarating experience and that’s what I love about sort of collaboration and 
design is that you have an idea but the minute you start talking to someone else about it, it’s all 
of the sudden this, “Oh, my goodness. That’s a great idea. Oh my gosh, this is so much better. 
Oh, I’m so excited.” That is—that’s wonderful so whether you’re out to dinner with someone or 
whether you’re working on this project for five years. I mean life is all about  
[01:25:00] 
being excited about it—about being—and it doesn’t have to be in a big explosive way, it’s—it 
can just be looking out the window. I’m looking our the window now of my California hillside 
and I see the plants that my husband and I have worked hard to plant and they’re California 
succulents and they’re so beautiful and they look like they landed here from Mars and it gives 
me such joy. They’re so beautiful and I want to go paint them and they’re beautiful. 
SF: So will you start painting when you retire way down the road or… 
LC: Oh, I’ll always do that and I guess I have to say, I painted all of the time as a kid as I told 
you and I painted in my garage and then like my neighbors would buy my paintings and hang 
them up in their living room or whatever. And then when I went to architecture school I didn’t 
traditionally do that anymore. There wasn’t time. So that kind of like drawing and that kind of 
creative relief of creating something beautiful like that turned into architecture, right? And of 
course you would do watercolor drawings and you would hand paint them and then others would 
do that as you sort of grew up in the ranks. But when I came to Walt Disney Imagineering, they 
have this sort of option where you can choose something. They want you to do something 
inspiring and you get a little bit of money to do it. And it’s supposed to be something that 
inspires you so that literally finally compelled me, after so many years of not actually picking up 
a paint brush, to do that and ever since I did that seven years ago, I’ve continued to paint so I 
actually have all sorts of paintings around my house and probably most of them are bad but they 
are—yeah, yeah so I do paint. 
SF: That’s amazing. So they expect you to take time out of your normal work week to do 
something that really inspires you?

LC: Yeah, absolutely, and there are so many people at Imagineering that do things like that, like 
paint, or do photography, but it could be even just going to other theme parks or going to the 
theatre or just something that inspires you. And that is—I mean that’s the key to creativity is you 
need to get up, you need to see new things, you need to see different things, you need to—I think 
it’s pushing yourself to do something different. Like if you never went bowling, go bowling, like 
do something different. 
AD: What stands out to you as your greatest achievement. 
LC: For me personally, just having the bravery to change my career kind of late in life, I feel. 
And to follow a path of always sort of finding the place that inspires me the most. And I’ve been 
so lucky to land in a few of these places and I’ve been at each of them for a long time because 
they have been so amazing and to—that was a huge change for me to be able to move from 
Boston to LA to go from the absolutely incredible family of Gund Partnership and Graham and 
to enter sort of this big corporate landscape and then to find that within that obviously that can be 
scary coming to this huge corporation but finding all of the opportunity within it and I’m still 
finding it. It still amazes me. There’s still just so much to learn and I love that day to day 
inspiration. It’s just every day coming to work or now getting on bluejeans or whatever it is and 
still having those Ah-ha moments with everybody because everyone is interested in how what 
we’re designing—how we’re going to tell these stories that will connect with all of our guests 
and fans around the world.  
[01:30:00] 
And it’s not just even just enjoying that day. I mean I feel it really—if a person is looking for 
some inspiration I think we have so many stories that model that and we’re always looking at 
making them more relevant. And currently, of course in these current times where we’re lookin 
at  Black Lives Matter around the world—the idea of relevancy and how we tell stories that are 
authentic has been something that has been first and foremost in our design minds here at 
Imagineering and it’s something we remind ourselves everyday. 
SF : Where are you now in your career? What do you see ahead? 
LC: Well right now it’s hard to look beyond the three ships coming. 
SF: You’ve got your work… 
LC: Yeah, yeah I think for now I can’t even contemplate it. There’s so much going on with this 
but I think on all of the levels of being a part of Imagineering—which is this incredible think 
tank where you work across so many different projects and initiatives and working within the 
Walt Disney Company. It’s just so rewarding. I think also because of our brand, we’re positioned 
in a way where there are many external companies that come to us and we’re able to collaborate 
with them as well and so to learn from each other. And that is also another incredible opportunity 
Laura Sanden Cabo Interview, July 10, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031
23
to just engage with expertise around the world. And then of course on your project at hand. I 
mean its—and so I think for me over the next couple of years I mean, I can’t even see beyond 
that right now we have so much going on. 
SF: What advice would you give to a young person contemplating a career in architecture?  
LC: I think the advice I would give is to not just think about it in the traditional way. I mean, 
the whole landscape of how we work, period—architecture or whatever it is has completely 
changed the last decade and I would say certainly in the last couple of months. So I would think 
bigger than just—there are certainly many incredible opportunities for a traditional AE 
[architecture engineering] firm but I think when you’re coming out of architecture school you 
might not be aware of the vast opportunities out there for someone who’s been trained with such 
creative thought processes. I think architects are trained to do many, many different things except 
you just don’t know about it when you’re in school so that’s what I would say. You can take your 
creativity I think to almost anywhere. 
SF: Are there any stories or projects that you would like to talk about or add at this point as we 
wrap up? 
LC: Well I guess I would say, I mean boy there’s been so many—every project to me has been 
like birthing a child and I think that that’s important. That every challenge that you’re given, I 
think no matter how small or how large or how inconsequential you might think it is at first, that 
it will be a better project because you have been there. And what each and every person can 
bring to that project in the end makes it different because DNA. So I think you need to throw 
yourself into projects. I think you also need to be strong enough to say when you think the design 
is going in a wrong way and in collaborative projects there’s lots of voices and I think sort of one 
of the hardest things to learn is to stand up and say, “I think differently.” That is a hard thing to 
do and even though it might not make for a smooth process, like sometimes you have to rethink 
things. And that’s what—design is not necessarily a linear process which is actually what makes 
the end results fantastic. It’s okay to fail. You know like you need to look at something and, “Oh, 
that doesn’t work.” Look at another thing, “You know that’s not quite right.” But that’s okay so I 
think that the design world because it is such a personal thing—you’re designing something 
that’s subjective  
[01:35:00] 
that sometimes you don’t develop that thick skin. You need to develop that thick skin and be able 
to walk away from things too. So as much as I feel you should be passionate and throw yourself 
into it you’ve got to be smart about being able to say, “You know what, maybe I was wrong. 
You’re right.”  
SF: Also it empowers I would think, other people by you standing up and saying, “I think 
differently.” It also, my guess is, would empower everyone else on that team to feel that they can 
Laura Sanden Cabo Interview, July 10, 2020

24
be honest. 
LC: Yeah, but I also think that anything you’re given—I remember one time I had a sign to 
design and I don’t—you know, I’m trained as an architect, how do you design a sign? And it was 
really interesting. Like you need to go find out everything about it and it all of the sudden 
becomes interesting and it becomes impactful. Or I’m thinking about the Cleveland Botanical 
Garden, you had asked me about, were there any key women who mentored me and influenced 
me. And there were two women—the name of the company was Rhodes Dahl, it was Vicky Dahl 
and Linda Rhodes and they had a project management firm. Linda was an architect and Vicky 
came from more of the execution world and they managed this project on behalf of the client, the 
Cleveland Botanical Garden. And they were tough—they were tough women but they pushed the 
team, they pushed me to repeatedly think outside-the-box and I worked with them for over a 
decade on sort of the transformation of the Cleveland Botanical Garden from sort of a sleepy 
little garden to this leading edge glass-house that had the biomes of—it’s still there today—that 
has the biomes of Madagascar and Costa Rica. And in a way it had a lot of ties to sort of the 
things we do here at Imagineering, in fact there were even consultants who worked with Disney 
on the project because we had to recreate Madagascar and Costa Rica. So recreating the sort of a 
cloud effect as you walked around and having birds and butterflies and animals but one thing that 
I loved about that was we had a meeting with the building department in Cleveland. And I think 
normally when you approach a meeting like that you think, Well I’m going to the building 
department. They’re only going to care about sort of, kind of, the schedule and technical things 
and what are we doing to meet all of the local requirements. And as part of what Graham Gund at 
the time was having us do—we were taking lessons in giving presentations—which is really like 
telling stories and sort of all of this sort of merges into my current life with Imagineering, being a 
storyteller. So he realized that being an architect, being a great architect—you had to tell great 
stories. And that’s life, right? Like everyone’s fascinated with the TED Talks you know, because 
you watch someone talk for twelve minutes about anything and the way that they do it is 
fascinating because they’re telling a story. 
SF: Yes. 
LC: So we were doing that and they said, “Okay, so you have to take your project and the next 
meeting you have you need to tell a story.” So I went to the building department in Cleveland 
and I made them close their eyes and I’m sure they sat there like “What! Like no one has ever 
asked us to do that. Why is anybody doing this?” And I don’t even remember exactly but it was 
something about, “Imagine the heat on your arms and your hair beginning to prickle up on your 
arms and the sway of the bridge, the rope bridge that you’re crossing, and that you feel a little 
tickle of the butterflies and blah, blah, blah and you open your eyes and you’re in the middle of 
Costa Rica but no there’s a raging snowstorm on top of the glass house in Cleveland. You know, 
anyways so, they looked at me and afterwards they said,  
[01:40:00] 
Laura Sanden Cabo Interview, July 10, 2020

“Nobody ever made us do that before. That was—they said no one’s ever cared enough.” 
SF: Bravo, bravo. 
LC: And so anyway, it was really scary to do that. I felt silly but they actually very much 
appreciated it and they loved being drawn into a story. 
SF: Great lesson, right? 
LC: Yeah. 
SF: Well anything else? 
LC: You know, I think this has been so kind of you to talk to me for all this time and I really do 
appreciate being part of this group to sort of showcase women architects and I guess I feel the 
breadth of what I’ve been privileged to do is not something I ever actually could have foreseen. 
And I guess my message would be that there are so many opportunities out there to do something 
special and impactful and I just hope that—I know there are many more young girls and women 
contemplating the field of design and I think architecture just prepares you to just be an amazing 
partner on any team in terms of solving the world’s problems and making the world a better 
place. 
SF: Well thank you. We are so fortunate that you agreed to share your story.  And it seems like 
you had almost the perfect preparation for where you are now, when everything sort of comes 
together, but a lot of it is your attitude about creativity and life and being a storyteller. Thank you 
so much for sharing. 
LC: You’re welcome Sallee, it’s my absolute pleasure.
