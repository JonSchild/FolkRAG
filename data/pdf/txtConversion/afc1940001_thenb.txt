Then blow, bullies, blowFor Cali-for-ni-o!There's plenty o' goldAs I've been toldOn the banks of
Sacramento!Oh, blow, bullies, blowFor Cali-for-ni-o!There's plenty o' grassTo break your fastOn the
banks of Sacramento!Blow, my bullies, blowFor Call-for-ni-o!There's plenty o' stonesAnd - dead -
men's - bonesOn the banks of Sacramento!
