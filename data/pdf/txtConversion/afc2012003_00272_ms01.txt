About Popcorn the Circus Comic… 
 
Popcorn was born ‘somewhere in the east’ and as a youngster became interested in magic 
which eventually lead to his career as a circus clown. Over the course of more than thirty 
years, Popcorn has entertained people, young and old. He recalls days of working in Clown 
Alley, of keeping a jar full of dimes for payphones, of occasionally ‘blowing the arrows’, 
and the rush he would get when the audience applauded for him.  
 
Popcorn has traveled around the country working for various circuses and is now retired to 
“Cornville,” in Mead, Oklahoma.

My name is Tanya Finchum along with Juliana Nykolaiszyn. We’re with 
the Oklahoma State University Library, part of the Oklahoma Oral 
History Research Program. We’re in Mead, Oklahoma today. It is July 
2, 2011, and we’re with Popcorn the Clown. Thank for inviting us into 
your home today. 
 
I’m glad you came in, because I hope I give you a little part of the 
history of clowning. 
 
Well, let’s start by having you tell us a little bit about your childhood, 
when you were born, where, and… 
 
I was born at a very early age somewhere in the east, and I wanted to be 
a magician. I always hung out at the magic house, but then I saw you 
had to carry all these props. (Laughs) So then I lucked in. I used to do 
spook shows. Do you know what spook shows are? 
 
I have no idea. 
 
At Halloween, when the theater would show Frankenstein and 
Batman—or no, who was that guy? The vampire. (Laughs) 
 
Count Dracula? 
 
Thank you. What was his real name? 
 
Vladimir… 
 
No, no, that’s the other one. That’s the updated one. (Laughs) Anyway, I 
started out on spook shows where the theater would bring in the horror 
movies in black and white, and then magicians and the hunchback and

the head-chopper and all that. I started on spook shows with Phil 
Chandler. Number one in clowning: you need a good announcer, yes. 
 
And where was this? 
 
Somewhere in the east. (Laughter) I played a lot of places.  
 
What do you consider your hometown? 
 
Mead, Oklahoma.  
 
Okay.  
 
The rest of it disappeared. I became Popcorn and if you ask anybody 
within six miles, they don’t know my name. 
 
How did you come up with the name Popcorn?  
 
I stole it. (Laughs) Yes, from a guy named Popcorn, and he was not a 
clown. And it’s a catchy name. They’ll always hear it, yes. 
 
And from the spook show, what next? 
 
Shrine circuses and birthday parties and stage shows and corporate 
things in Jersey. I’ve had an interesting life. 
 
We want you to tell us about it. (Laughter) 
 
What drew you to clowning? What made you want to become a clown? 
 
Never, never, never. I never thought I’d end up in the business, and I 
spent thirty-some years there. I had a knack, that’s all I can tell you. 
Even Bob’s father [Harry Rawls] said, “You’ve got a knack.” 
 
How did you hook up with Bob’s father? 
 
Not until I moved here. (Laughs) I’ve seen him here and there. His 
father was a showman, and I was always with old clowns. I consider 
myself the last of the old-timers. We did the same gags, we did the same 
stuff, but you’ve got to switch it. “When are we going to rehearse?” The 
first show we rehearsed. “You do this, you do that.” Sometimes there 
were thirty clowns, then it became ten, then it became eight, seven, six, 
five, two… (Laughs) There are no clown alleys anymore. 
 
I haven’t noticed any either.

No, there are no clown alleys. They just run in and do their stuff and… 
Yes, I remember even working with old-timers. I’m an old-timer! 
(Laughs) 
 
So thirty-seven years, when did you retire? 
 
Whenever I came here, and none of us can remember. (Laughs) I think 
one night I was doing a three hundred mile jump and fell asleep, and if it 
wasn’t for a trucker, I would have hit a tree. It was time to go find a 
home. I think all circus people want a home. Bob [Rawls] hated the 
business, and he grew up in it. (Laughs) 
 
You get tired of being on the road? 
 
Too old. “I’ve fallen down and can’t get up!” (Laughs) Seriously, I used 
to tell them before I retired that if I drop dead in the ring, make it funny 
and get me out of there. (Laughs) 
 
How would you come up with your costume? 
 
Oh, here and there, and here and there. The violin is me, the camera is 
me (gesturing to photographs). Bob [Rawls] painted that picture—that’s 
me—and complained about the pin I put on it. I always said, “No 
autographs,” and there are certain kids you can give an autograph to. I 
remember seeing grandfathers come who have never been to the circus. 
“Let me get you a seat.” I used to do ‘meet and greet’ on the way in.  
 
So Popcorn, could you tell us the first time you met D.R. Miller? 
 
I can’t answer that. 
 
I mean, what you thought about him or… 
 
Nobody liked him. (Laughs) He was a showman. He liked me, don’t ask 
me. I don’t know. 
 
You made him laugh? 
 
I have no idea. [But I was always welcome at his home.] See if you can 
find me (gestures to route book), but that’s my clowns on Carson and 
Barnes—English, Spanish… (Laughs) 
 
Could you run me through, maybe, a typical act during your Carson and 
Barnes years? 
 
Hurry up, change, and wait. (Laughs) [Just in case there was an accident

or an act was late,] you had to be ready. So you had to hurry and change 
and run back and wait. It was called “hurry up and wait.” “Oh, God! We 
didn’t have to go in this time.” 
 
You said you used different props? 
 
Oh, yes. I made them out of junk. 
 
Like what, one or two? 
 
That camera, I made out of old film boxes and an old tripod from a 
surveyor and took pictures of jackasses. 
 
Pretended to? 
 
No, I took pictures of jackasses. (Laughs) It’s entertainment, [I literally 
took pictures of jackasses. I got the idea from Hee Haw.] 
 
Well, during one show, about how many times would you change 
costumes? 
 
Maybe three. Yes, maybe three because you kind of wore the same 
costume for each thing, but you had to change. You’d change a hat, 
you’d change a vest. 
 
Just a little different. 
 
They don’t see it. (Laughs) And the tacky, beat up, old props in the 
spotlight they look pretty. (Laughs) 
 
And the kids loved you? 
 
I have no idea. I entertained both sides, adults and children. David Rawls 
used to say, “You’re a little too tacky.” (Laughs) But I had done that for 
twelve years!  
 
And you had a dog act? 
 
I had a dog act, a chimp act, the lions, several ladies. (Laughs) Oh, they 
all thought it was a fantasy. I said, “No, it is not a fantasy. It’s mud and 
rain, snow, sleet, wrecks…” Yes. If you can survive in the circus, you 
can survive anywhere. Yes. You’re independent. Sometimes you don’t 
have water, sometimes you don’t have electricity. You pay your own 
insurance, which you didn’t hear from David. (Laughs) Yes. No, you 
paid everything. You got a salary, maybe gas, cookhouse, but you were 
responsible for everything else—independent contractor. I’m losing time

here.  
 
And did you have a trailer or camper trailer or… 
 
I’ve always had a camper or a trailer or a vehicle, yes—independent, 
independent. No, I don’t live in a sleeper. Have you looked in any 
sleepers yet? 
 
Not on this trip. (Laughter) 
 
I did that one season just to save money because I knew that sooner or 
later I had to quit. But those sleepers are atrocious. You didn’t hear that, 
did you Dad? (Laughter) Yes, you’ve got to go there when it’s all in and 
take a look at everything. 
 
Yes. 
 
Well, when you’re performing, are you paying attention to the crowd? 
 
I pay attention to everything. The crowd, how they’re moving, if it’s not 
going over, we’re going to cut it short. Get in and get out. 
 
So you’re responding to the crowd and everything. 
 
Yes, I have no idea, I just had it. Oh, yes. I had an outline of everything I 
did, but never rehearsed. The first show was a rehearsal. After that, then 
we’ll figure it out. I’ve been in the Kennedy Center, the old Cincinnati 
Gardens, Tom Snyder, Captain Kangaroo, and Bozo. Almost made the 
Kiss tour, almost.  
 
Did you have any showbiz idols that you look up to, any clown idols?  
 
No. Lou Jacobs was good. Felix Adler was good. Otto Griebling, 
Emmett Kelly—eh. No, I just tried to copy all of them. (Laughs) That’s 
what Bob’s dad said, “You remind me of all the old ones.” I’m the last 
one left, I think. 
 
How would you come up with your new material? 
 
I just rehashed the old stuff. (Laughs) Yes. I remember on Carson and 
Barnes all these clowns I just showed you, blah, blah, blah. They hadn’t 
seen a clown gag in years. It was all mostly Hispanic people. I did the 
Reducer where you put the fat lady in and (makes buzzing noise) and 
boom! Out comes… (Laughs) And it actually got an applause at 
rehearsal from circus performers. I told Jennifer, I said, “You’ll never 
hear that again.” See, there are rushes, there are rushes. There is nothing

better than a standing ovation, which you don’t ever expect.  
 
But you got a few? 
 
What? 
 
But you got a few standing ovations? 
 
Oh, yes. They bring goose bumps yet. (Laughs) I don’t know. I had a 
very interesting life. I met a lot of interesting people. I traveled, too. I 
tried to see everything and hit the flea markets on my way. 
 
On the circus lot, did you have to do other things or did you just have to 
worry about clowning? 
 
[I was told a long time ago by Albert White that I am a performer not a 
worker so I never did but many others did.] No, I was a performer and 
clowns in the old days, there used to be thirty, forty clowns on some of 
these shows and then the shows got less. When I started, there were 
around a hundred and fifty shows on the road. I think now, there might 
be ten, fifteen at the most. And all of a sudden, you had nowhere to go. 
The clown alleys got less and less. In the old days, every clown had a 
character, like the cop and the buffoon and the pretty one. But that all 
disappeared. 
 
Beatty—Clyde Beatty, that doesn’t exist. It’s Cole Brothers now. They 
used to have a tent for the clowns called Clown Alley. Most performers 
didn’t want to dress with the clowns, so we had our own place. (Laughs) 
I have no idea. Cookhouse, management, performers, working men, 
clowns (indicating a caste system with clowns at the bottom)—but that 
disappeared. Do you want to sit next to somebody that kind of smells? 
(Laughs) It’s a neat life. You either like it or you don’t. Some joined the 
circus and lasted three, four days. Some of them might have made it 
three weeks. They come and go, and I have no idea why I ended up there 
in the circus. I think I felt—I loved the audience. It was a challenge. 
(Laughs) 
 
Talk a little bit about your makeup, what you were saying before. 
 
Oh, no. Remember Ringling Clown College? 
 
Yes. 
 
Okay, they all painted their stuff on. Mine was put on with fingers. 
(Laughs) And it slowly went from white face pretty to corn. What I 
wanted to finally do was eliminate the makeup. On some shows I used to

take if off the last gag, and go out and do the gag, [and get the same 
laughs.] (Laughs) But then I retired. I didn’t want to die on the road. I’d 
rather die right here in Cornville.  
 
And would you have to make your own wardrobe? 
 
I usually went to thrift shops and bought ugly shirts [and ties and suits]. 
(Laughs) 
 
I always look at the shoes for clowns. You had to order those from 
somewhere didn’t you? 
 
I’ve got my last pair, but it’s in the archives. They were made by Griffin, 
Griffin Theatrical Shoes. They don’t exist anymore. Handmade, shoe 
size inside, shoes. They’re in the archives out there, but that’s what they 
look like. 
 
And what are you referring to as archives? 
 
I have so much stuff! 
 
Here?  
 
Your personal archives? 
 
Well, plus what people—I don’t collect, I just acquire. (Laughs) Look 
around the house. 
 
But not at the circus museum that they’re trying to start? 
 
That’s what I’m waiting on. They better get in gear because my stuff’s 
getting dry rot. (Laughs) Are they still going to put it downtown? 
 
Yes, across from the library. Well, did you have a favorite costume, 
which one you liked the best? 
 
No, it didn’t matter. I tried to fit it to the gag. 
 
It changed each season? 
 
No, winter, fall, summer clothes. (Laughs) Wardrobe, I always did have 
one of those, even the big tweed top coat, tweed. Remember those? 
Earmuffs and gloves, it used to get cold. I’ve seen it sleet. Did they 
mention Gainesville, Texas? They used to have a community circus. 
You know all about that?

I heard about it.  
 
And did you perform with it some? 
 
No, no, no. That was before my time.  
 
Well, would you ever take new clowns under your wing? 
 
Oh, too many. “I’m from Ringling! I can’t do that!” (Laughs) I’ve had a 
lot, including Spanish, which I couldn’t communicate with. “No! We 
work big top, putting up the top.” “No, you’re clowning! Mr. Miller said 
you’re clowning!” I don’t think I’ve got a picture of them. They ended 
up being funny, finally. (Laughs) 
 
Is it hard to teach somebody how to clown? 
 
Yes, they’ve either got it or they don’t. I’ve been shot with a blank in the 
head, in the posterior area, because you made those things out of shells, 
explosions, firecrackers. That’s why I don’t hear well. I was small. I 
always got stuck in the box. I started out as a pointer.  I said, “This 
sucks.” (Laughs) Then I became a producing clown, then I ran out of 
clowns, and then I did single things, and an announcer helps.   
 
Would you work with the announcer on the script? 
 
No! (Laughs) I just play it by ear. “Play it again, Sam.” (Laughs) No, 
yes. Jim Royal was a good announcer, a friend of mine. Most of my 
friends aren’t around anymore—Phil Chandler, yes. He was kind of my 
agent because he didn’t want to work with another clown unless it was 
me. But, we clicked. Albert White—I’m just running through names—
Albert White, Ringling clown under the big top. When the clown college 
started, they wanted him to go to the college and he said, “I’ve done 
forty years and they want me to go to college?” (Laughs) It’s a neat 
history. I enjoyed it. It was the weather, the mud, the rain. My parents 
used to go, “Why do you live like this?” I’m kind of free, really, as long 
as you did your job and caused no hassle. I never had anybody up my 
whatever, really.  
 
Would you have a signature piece that you brought to your act? 
 
Well, sometimes I’d bring the camera, the violin. That was more stage 
than anything. I’ve worked stage shows, festivals, fairs—good food at 
fairs, by the way—and always the lady auxiliary had good home 
cooking. A lot of that stuff is gone now. 
 
It is. How would you learn of those gigs, or how would you get them

lined up? 
 
People would call me.  
 
You had a reputation then. 
 
I guess. (Laughs) I guess. No, I don’t know. The easiest part was that it 
was easy. (Laughs) Bob hates it. He clowned. You’ve got to remember, 
he grew up in the circus. Everybody says, “That clowning is 
humiliating.” Hey, it’s not if you get a laugh. If you don’t get a laugh, 
you might get it the second show or the third show. 
 
Every audience is a little different. 
 
Yes, you can’t tell. I used to like to do ‘meet and greet.’ Bring them in 
and try to calm them down, and you’re coming to the circus, or blah, 
blah, blah. 
 
When you did that, did you speak or was it all pantomime? 
 
Oh, no, no. [I did both.] I’d pantomime [and speak], but that was, “Step 
right this way. Have your ticket ready.” They already turned their ticket 
in. (Laughs) I loved the audience. I liked the smell of the big top. Shrine 
dates are like playing Ringling [dates but miniature]. I’ve done the 
Maine dates in the snow, the Jimmy Cole show in the snow. I’ve been 
coast to coast; California, east coast, Texas, Canada. I got to see more 
than people I graduated with, and I haven’t been to a class reunion in 
fifty-five years. I wonder how many are left. (Laughs)  
 
Did you have brothers and sisters? 
 
No. I should have. 
 
And you said you were a towner? 
 
Yes, and I got accepted in a very hard business and did it for thirty-some 
years. 
 
Did your parents come and watch a couple of times? 
 
Finally. (Laughs) No, yes, finally. Boy, I’m glad they took Dad’s 
driver’s license away because he was a terrible driver! 
 
Do you remember your last show? 
 
Yes, kind of. Somewhere in Bloomington, Illinois, and I said, “That’s

it.” That was after I almost wrecked. I drove from Bloomington, Illinois, 
or Indiana—there are two of those—all the way here and I said, “Is that 
property on the hill still for sale?”  
 
Why Oklahoma? 
 
I have no idea! (Laughs) 
 
I mean, you’ve seen everywhere. 
 
I liked it here. Look how laid back it is here. I knew Bob from a long 
time ago. The circus is sixty-five miles of a boring highway. I’m a 
member of the Showmen’s Club. I think number forty-nine. I don’t 
know, I’ve got to look. All I can say is it happened a long time ago and 
all of a sudden it was over. Yes, it was over!  
 
Do you miss it? 
 
Oh, yes. Yes. See, here it comes. (Laughs) There’s nothing better than 
the smell, the roar of the crowd—if you can get them to roar. 
 
Well, describe the smell. 
 
What? 
 
Describe the smell. 
 
Cotton candy, elephant dung, thoroughly dried and cured. I gave D.R. 
Miller one of those for Christmas. He liked it—I don’t know why.  
 
Just a combination of all those smells together? 
 
Yes, the smell of corn, cotton candy (makes sniffing sounds]… It’s 
much preferable to step in elephant dung than dog dung. (Laughs) 
You’ve got to wash your shoes off. Chimps, chimps are like having 
three Hell’s Angels. They’re a hassle. When you have animals, you can’t 
leave, you can’t get a babysitter, you can’t leave them in the truck 
without a fan or air conditioning. And lions, the same thing. They can’t 
exist in the snow, I found out. I’ve just had a lot of—look at all the scars, 
okay?  (Laughs) 
 
Did you ever get injured? 
 
Only by stupidity or over confidence.  
 
Shot out of a canon?

I slid down the barrel one time and I said, “No! No! No!” “Make 
yourself stiff and straight.”  (Laughs) “No, no!” I thought I wanted to be 
a flying trapeze artist because I was very athletic. You see it on whatever 
you’ve seen them. That platform looks about like this. (Gestures big) 
No—it’s like this!  (Gestures tiny) And the bar must weigh ninety 
pounds to pull you out of the loft. No, I didn’t want to be a flyer after 
that. My back was sore from landing in the—“Let go, Popcorn!” “Oh!” 
(Laughs) It’s different. The people risk their lives, not only during the 
performance, but traveling, the weather. Yes. I’ve seen the rain coming 
in my trailer. I’ve been in two or three tornados, a hurricane. Surviving.  
 
The most important thing is lights and water. Everybody says, “You’ve 
got everything in here.” I’m paying for it, and I’ve got lights, water, and 
not five gallons of hot water! (Laughs) Yes, mud, waiting for the 
elephants to pull you off. Clowning is basically a lost art, but they all 
become high-line singles. That’s the muddy lot in Greeneville, Ohio. 
(Gesturing to a photograph) 
 
Boy, it is muddy. 
 
Boots, three pair, sometimes in a season, boots. I’ve worked muddy lots 
and gotten stuck in the mud during the clown gag, and they’d have to 
come out and pull me out of my boots. I said, “Get my boots.” Mud 
shows, that’s why they’re called mud shows. 
 
And the crowd probably thought that was planned? 
 
No, they were all muddy. (Laughs) Yes, mud show. A friend of mine’s 
got a book after him, and I don’t have a copy, called Mud Show. I don’t 
know what else. 
 
What would do you during off season? Like November, December, 
January? 
 
Save money, save change. I still save change and cash it in, in the 
winter. (Laughs) Seriously, and I save change from ’90, back.  
 
The year? 
 
Yes, ’90, back. I don’t know, it’s just a thing, but I still cash in all the 
other change at the end of November. It’s just a thing. 
 
But would you work? Do other jobs between the end of the circus and 
when it started back up?

Whatever I could find. Usually the easiest job to get was a custodian, 
which then, they called janitors. No, I’m a custodian of the school. 
 
And where would you usually winter? 
 
Hugo. 
 
…in Hugo. 
 
And what did you think of Hugo? 
 
Hug-o, hug-o. (Laughs) The streets need fixed. The only ones that are 
smooth now is the one from Kelly Miller all the way out to Carson and 
Barnes. (Laughs) It used to be that way.  
 
Did you ever live in the Modern Trailer Park? 
 
You mean a trailer trash joint? (Laughs) No, I always look for a state 
park or a nice campground when I had time off, just to get away from it. 
No, no trailer parks. Who’s got that on there? Jerry! Jerry! Episodes in 
trailer parks. I don’t sleep good so sometimes I’m up at three, four, five 
in the morning, and I think its old age. I kind of like watching daylight 
break.  
 
I guess you got to do a lot of that when you were on the road? 
 
Oh, no, it was dark. Honk, honk, honk! (Imitates knocking) “We’re 
going to move!” And then you’d go off in the darkness, and then you’d 
see the sun come up and then there’d be thunder and lightning. “Oh God, 
another muddy lot!”  
 
And how would you know where you were going? 
 
See that arrow and that sign? (Gesturing to photograph on wall) That’s 
slow down, you’re going to make a left. Then you would get a little 
route slip, for those that could read, but you followed the arrows. A lot 
of times, you didn’t have to think because they led you right to the lot. 
So you lost some of the thought, but I can read a road map, yes. Slow 
down, you’re going to make a left.  
 
Would you ever get lost? 
 
Oh, yes. Other shows would change the arrows. (Laughs) The old days, 
it was hit and run, hit and run.  
 
Each show had their own color?

Yes, or their own insignia. I think that’s—the old one, Clyde Beatty-
Cole Brothers, but those [arrows] are old Cole Brothers. Some of them, 
you couldn’t see at night or in the early morning. I’ve seen them on 
paper plates. They draw the arrow out. (Laughs) I’ve seen them on top 
of bridges just for somebody they wanted to agitate. Follow the arrows. I 
don’t have all this stuff. I didn’t know what you wanted, but I’ve got 
archives. I hope the museum opens. 
 
Did you use particular music for your act? 
 
Oh, just the violin. That was from Clockwork Orange. It was a good… 
(Imitates music) And then I added a Michael Jackson glove, that the 
high pitched—blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But I’d do the fingers. 
(Laughs) Don’t ask me, I just did it! It was being accepted and for a 
towner going into the circus, I—if I was a gun shooter, I’d put a notch. 
(Laughs) 
 
Well, what was payday like? 
 
Wait in line, wait in line, and wait in line! (Laughs) 
 
Would they pay you cash or check? 
 
No, they’d give you—well, in the old days, you got cash. That’s why I 
don’t make a lot on Social Security. Oh, and they’d cash it at the 
window, but you had to wait and wait, and the line would be real long.  
 
And would you ever get fined? 
 
I never did.  
 
And what were some of the things you could get fined for? 
 
Not showing up for a clown gag, not showing up for the Spec that went 
around the tent, bringing the law. (Laughs) 
 
Would you do it all over again? 
 
Yes, but I can’t. “I’ve fallen down and can’t get up!” (Laughs) 
 
Well, you mentioned the last time you put on your makeup was for 
D.R.’s funeral. Could you tell me about D.R.’s funeral? 
 
The best funeral I was ever at. It was under a big top in Hugo, out at that 
complex out there. His casket was sitting on two elephant tubs. It was

candy apple red with gold handles. It was a whole thing, and then I was 
honored to do makeup. That’s the last time. Hugo closed down. There 
was a big parade from the horse blah, blah, blah, blah, all the way to the 
cemetery. They bused people in. After the funeral, they fed everybody. 
D.R. was on ice for months until the show came in. Wherever he died—
I’ve got that back there—was the first time he ever saw a circus. That’s 
where he died. And he was on ice until the show came in and then they 
shipped him out here. There was an old funeral carriage pulled by two, 
four, six black horses, I think. I can’t remember. An antique bandwagon 
from Baraboo, Wisconsin, a parade. The best funeral I was ever at. I felt 
funny posing at the funeral in clown makeup, but that was an honor and 
that’s the last time I put it on. I’d have to go back and look at the articles 
to give you the date. 
 
Did they ask you to put on the makeup? Or did you think, “I’m putting it 
on.” 
 
No, no. I was asked to do it.  
 
And how did that make you feel? 
 
The last time I had to put that crap on. (Laughs) 
 
Do you remember what you wore? What particular outfit you wore? 
 
Probably a ruffled shirt, a vest and pant. I don’t know. I can’t remember 
that.  
 
That’s okay. 
 
But the article went around the world. Yes. No, why he liked me, I have 
no idea. Not many people liked him. (Laughs) 
 
I’m sure you made him laugh, though. 
 
I have no idea. 
 
Well, when people think back to Popcorn the Clown in his heyday, what 
do you want people to remember? 
 
He was kind of funny. (Laughs) Really! I don’t know what Bob said, but 
he always said, “You’re funny!” I said, “It’s tacky clowning. What do 
you mean?” David Rawls called me sick. (Laughter) I tried to play off of 
what was going on. If it was the Titanic movie, I’d be in a captain’s 
thing and a hat and, “Welcome to the Titanic. I can get you on the top 
deck. Have a pleasant journey.” (Laughs)

One time, they rebuilt the Cincinnati Gardens and I was playing there 
with the show and it was atrocious, whatever they did to it, the tent. I 
said, “Welcome to the Cincinnati Gardens. Come on in. Yes, it looks 
just like it!” (Laughs) I tried to entertain everybody. “Welcome to 
Wright Patterson Air Force Base, hanger eighteen.” Do you know 
what’s in hanger eighteen? The one from—where was that where the 
aliens supposedly landed? 
 
Oh, Area 51, yes. (Laughter) Do you think clowns get a bad rap? 
 
Yes, yes, yes, yes. I was told, “You’re a necessary evil.” Like I said for 
years, you couldn’t dress with the performers.  
 
But they needed you to fill in the gaps. 
 
Yes, but it was kind of nice having your own joint. (Laughs) I remember 
working with—who was the sergeant from Gomer Pile, in Harrisburg, 
Pennsylvania. I lost that picture of me and him together, but he always 
had ice cold beer in his dressing room. Stars get… 
 
Special treatment? 
 
Yes. It would’ve been nice. The best I got was a private dressing room 
with a shower and towels and a limo to the restaurant. (Laughs) 
 
Well, that was pretty good. 
 
Well, yes. Where was that? Pine Knob, Michigan, somewhere, a big 
resort. 
 
Did you have a favorite town or venue that you played? 
 
No, no. There were some shows you would play the same towns over 
and over, like three, four years in a row, and you would meet people 
from [all over]—“Popcorn, do you want to come out and have lunch?” 
“Well, yes!” (Laughs) Yes, you meet friends. You met a lot of 
interesting people. Yes, the people, the people. I liked the public and 
circus fans. We have circus fans, or we used to. I don’t know. Like 
baseball fans and football fans. They’d come out and they’d bring a 
lunch and go pick your mail up. You had to tell in advance what town 
they’re going to pick it up. [My opinion of circus fans is they always 
wanted to run away with the circus and never could. They were always a 
friend to the circus!] 
 
Payphones, they don’t exist anymore! You used to have to carry a jar of

change along for the payphone and sometimes you’d forget it. Then 
along came the AT&T credit card, and now I have one outside 
communication, that’s it. [referring to his cell phone] And the TV with 
six channels because of that box the government made us buy. (Laughs) 
Payphones, I see them maybe at Wal-Mart, maybe at Lowe’s. 
 
How is clowning different today versus your time? 
 
They’ve become more elite. They’ve become more elite, that’s all I can 
say. 
 
Is that a good thing or a bad thing? 
 
It depends. It just depends.  
 
How could you break into the business today? Do you have to go 
through Clown College to do it? 
 
No, that’s obsolete now. It’s called experience. No, if anybody says, 
“Oh, I want to get [in the business]”—I say, “Don’t even think about it!” 
It’s tough and in the beginning, you were kind of the low rung. Below us 
were the working people, above that was cookhouse, above that was 
owners, above that was performers. I went from there to here, okay? 
(Gestures from low to high) Because I remember, you’re a performer. 
Clown, that says thirty-five bucks [back in the day]. 
 
Thirty-five bucks for… 
 
And a cookhouse and sleeper. (Laughs) 
 
Thirty-five per week or per show? 
 
Per week [is where I started and progressed quickly]. I told you, the 
clowns that I’ve had—$125 a week, plus cookhouse, plus a beautiful 
sleeper. 
 
That they provided or you bought, the sleeper? 
 
No, they provided it. You might get electric, you might not. The shower 
might work at the end, communal shower. Air conditioning might work. 
I stayed one season just to save money and wear and tear. And the next 
season, I took my van on the road. I said, “That’s enough of this!” I paid 
somebody for a shower. The fairgrounds, that has got cold water if 
you’re going to shower! (Gestures shivering) Yes, see? You got lights, 
water, sewer… (Laughs)

That’s probably a good feeling. 
 
I did my job and got no harassment.  
 
And applause.

Yes, yes. Corn, I made it somewhere where you don’t make it much. 
And why, I have no idea. The mud, the rain, the snow, the sleet, the hail, 
the wrecks. “Did we blow the arrows? Damn! Got to turn around!”
