Introduction 
0.00.30 
Mark relays that he grew up outside of Boston, went to college in Vermont, and 
studied writing. He says his first inspiration for nursing was at a state school for 
intellectually disabled individuals. He also worked for a nursing home. He had 
other jobs around the country before a friend of his went to nursing school and he 
also went to nursing school; he decided on psych due to prior experience.  
0.01:53 
He went to MATC  (Madison Area Technical College). He talks a bit about how 
he ended up in Madison; his family had moved here in the 1960s (before he did). 
He graduated from MATC in 1981-82.  
0.02.51 
He describes learning on the job; there was a rotation in school (for clinicals) in 
psych, which he did at Mendota Mental Health Institute. Felt that psych, seemed 
like the most interesting aspect. He talks about interacting with other nurses.  
0.04.34 
“More than any courses that I could cite, the main thing is exposure to the people, 
to the patients. You learn a lot.” He states he enjoyed working with the mental 
health population, but it could be difficult; for example, found that personality 
disorders were difficult. He describes working with patients with psychotic 
disorders.  
0.06.01 
His first job out of MATC was at Mendota. He describes his early impressions of 
the hospital (which is a state psychiatric hospital): industrial tile and steel. “It 
wasn’t trying to be a posh atmosphere like St. Mary’s or Meriter. It was plain.” 
The patients were all committed (involuntary rather than voluntary). He worked 
there for two years; he always worked the p.m. shift (from 3pm to 12am). He 
describes a general day at Mendota: do admissions, communicate with patients, 
“putting out fires.” “There was a fair degree of violence on that unit; it was the 
admissions unit.”  
0.07.46 
He talks about switching jobs to Meriter Hospital (a private hospital). A friend 
recommended to him a job on an eating disorder unit. He describes the patients 
having a lot of personality disorders compared to Mendota; it wasn’t as violent. 
“It was much more middle-class, upper middle-class environment whereas 
Mendota was a little more rough and tumble.” Meriter patients more often had

insurance. He clarifies that he didn’t have to do much with insurance but was 
aware of that aspects of the job. 
0.09.37 
He states he worked 2-3 years in eating disorders until there was a merger 
between different hospitals in the area. After the merger, he describes various 
changes, “It was a slightly different culture.”  
0.12.08 
He stayed with Meriter after merger and worked in the psych unit still. He 
describes some of the patients he worked with. He stayed for 28 years.  
0.13.47 
Mark talks about why he stayed at Meriter: liked his coworkers, “that’s a big part 
of it,” and also the patient population was interesting. He talks about a memorable 
day there; for example, with people self-harming, which was hard “because you 
have to interrupt.” “Realistically, they did do a processing thing, or were 
supposed to, but I don’t think anyone felt it came to much of anything. It’s a big 
thing. I think the person who was his nurse had a little PTSD from that. It was 
very upsetting for her. But we all went out afterwards to the Crystal, shot some 
pinball, had some beer. That was our processing. And it was an effective way to 
do it, rather than just sit in a little group like this and try to think of something.”  
0.15.43 
He talks a bit about mentoring and learning from coworkers and being on the job.  
0.16.46 
He describes working a “weekender program” which was a shift arrangement 
where he worked “two twelves” (12-hour shifts) on Saturday and Sunday then off 
the rest of the week. He did this for 8 years. He states it was tiring, including his 
commute to Madison, but was a good arrangement because it left him time to 
write.  
0.17.58 
He talks about his career as a writer; he currently writes poetry, which he got 
more interested in after nursing school. He describes how nursing influences his 
writing. “What I got from nursing was the variety of ways that people think, and 
that has certainly come into a lot of poems.” He talks about a specific example 
from nursing that directly influenced a poem of his.  
0.20.00 
Charitie asks about relationships between staff members (nurses and other 
disciplines). Mark talks about working with mental health specialists. The nurses 
handled medical issues and various assessments. Relays that there weren’t broad 
differences between the different groups working in mental health. “There’s 
always politics who are a little less able or willing to get along with.” But for the 
most part it was a congenial atmosphere.  
0.21.25 
He describes some changes in mental health during his career. For instance, the 
stays became shorter, especially compared to Mendota or the state school he 
worked at. This did not affect nursing practice; nurses still needed to assess 
patients. 
0.22.26 
He describes important characteristics of nurses in mental health: empathy, 
compassion, be insightful, be non-judgmental. He states he had to learn to get 
along with a wide variety of “types” amongst staff.  
0.23.26 
“It was a nice feeling at the end of the day to feel as if somebody’s best interests 
were served. It felt really good to feel as if you made a difference. That’s all of 
nursing.”  
0.24.02 
He talks about running groups for patients and showing other new nurses how to 
do this and other tasks. Sometimes worked with student nurses.

0.24.55 
He describes formal training in psych; he took psych in college, rotation at 
MATC. “For the most part, for the hospital in-patient staff, you learn on the job. I 
think it was a great learning experience.” Learned from watching other nurses, but 
mostly from watching patients and talking with them. He describes his 
experiences working with the eating disorder patients; felt that the groups did not 
necessarily benefit these patients; they should have been treated more for medical 
needs with therapy occurring after discharge. Patients were often readmitted after 
discharge.  
0.27.50 
He had 30 years of nursing experience. He describes retirement after Meriter; 
writing, bicycling, etc. He also volunteers at the My Life, My Story program at 
the Veteran’s Hospital. He has done 170 interviews with veterans through the 
program. He talks about how he found out about the program and started 
volunteering there.  
0.29.40 
Charitie: Do you have any advice for new nurses? “It really is, and I think to a 
large degree on all the units, a lot of it is learning as you go. Certainly, a lot of 
procedures you may do in nursing school, but you don’t really do them until 
you’re on the floors.” States he had good training at MATC; students got 
introduced to a variety of types of nursing, ICU, NICU, etc.  
0.31.12 
He describes working in the “float pool” for a while, where he worked at different 
units as needed; the units are very different. “Different sorts of people would go 
into those areas. They were way different.” For example, psych had a different set 
of medical needs. “It’s a much different crew on ICU and NICU and OR. Their 
duties are way different as you can imagine. You’re not handing anyone 
instruments; you’re not gowned up all day.”  
0.33.25 
Mark briefly talks about balancing medical needs and psychiatric needs.  
0.34.02 
He describes some changes in mental health; for example, medication updates and 
changes. Suggests some changes that he would like to see: longer stays if needed. 
He relates that there was some conflict when he worked about length of stay for 
some patients; nurses might disagree with psychiatrists. “Some of them [the 
psychiatrists] seemed particularly insightful and others not so much.” He felt for 
the most part that nurses could communicate their opinions to doctors but relates 
sometimes there were “awkward” interactions between the groups.  
0.37.44 
He talks about times when patients were a danger to themselves or others; there 
was a locked side of the Meriter unit. Patients might need more careful 
monitoring. If people were too dangerous, they might be discharged to a different 
hospital such as Mendota.  
0.39.02 
Charitie asks him to explain some terms he used: 15-minute checks and 1:1. On 
15-minute checks, you have a flow sheet and check in on patient every 15 
minutes. “One to one would mean somebody would have to be sitting within 
eyesight of the patient all the time, around the clock.” Typically, 1:1 checks 
would be on the locked side rather than on the general population side of the 
psychiatric unit at Meriter. He talks about the levels of checks when patients are 
admitted. 15 minutes was for patients who were “risky.”  
0.41.35 
He talks about the most common diagnosis he saw at Meriter: depression and 
borderline personality. At Mendota, more schizophrenia and bipolar.

0.42.20 
He states that psychiatric nursing could be stressful, “It’s not unbearable.” He 
describes how the days can vary; initially calm, next minute a lot going on. 
Compares this in a similar way to the E.R., a lot of down time, then being very 
busy. “I think just given the amount of time I’d been dealing with that population; 
you triage these things the best you can.” “The most stressful occasion was a 
suicide on the unit. That was stressful because the guy was dead. We had to try to 
revive him; you can’t pronounce anybody ‘dead’ unless you’re a doctor or a 
coroner. We were still trying to bring him to life. Meantime all these patients had 
to be dealt with. The police dropped by; they came over. That was a pretty 
stressful evening. Lesser degrees of that, people self-abusing is not fun to see. 
There would be people coming in who were super manipulative.” He describes a 
story about a specific “chronic” (repeat) patient with substance abuse issues and 
other patients who kept coming back.  
0.45.22 
Regarding the hospital’s position on chronic patients, “They’re in a super 
awkward position. For all their failings, that’s a tough one. Somebody comes into 
the ER and says they’re suicidal, what are you gonna do? It puts them in a tough 
position because in many cases they don’t think the person probably is, but just 
wants to be in the hospital. Then they make they wrong call, and it’s the wrong 
call.”  
0.46.13 
Lists other psychiatric inpatient hospitals in Madison. He talks about an old 
hospital, Parkway, that was only open short time; it was a for profit hospital. He 
talks about interactions he had with other hospitals on his shift. He would go to 
the “charge meetings” where charge nurses give the overview of the shift. He 
talks about how the electronic record changed communication between hospitals 
and between staff. Talks about his personal experience of the change to electronic 
health records. “I don’t think it was great. I think people had to spend more time 
fussing with the computers. You couldn’t avoid it; it wasn’t that you didn’t know 
the program. You had to log in and do all this preparation before you even started. 
They wanted suicide checks, 15-minute checks in real time, which meant you’d 
have to log in every 15 minutes. I’m not sure how that got resolved. Used to be, 
you would have a clipboard and you’d do all the checks then make a note, a 
narrative after that.” (Laughs about not being able to think of any benefits). 
Problems doing admissions and interviews with patients, nurses would be sitting 
at the computer, “That is a loss of communication. You might turn and make eye 
contact as needs must, but for the most part there you are clicking on and asking 
these questions. I think it undermined the rapport.” Face to face interviews better 
in his opinion.  
0.51.12 
Wrapping up interview. Chatting. He talks briefly about working on the child and 
adolescent unit at Meriter. “No one wanted to go over there.” He describes the 
number of patients on each unit and a few characteristics of them, broadly.  
0.54.22 
Mark “I wish I could think of a story.”  
 
Charitie “That’s just what we do; we press people for stories.”  
 
Mark “Oh, me to. Me too.”  
0.54.53 
“What was really interesting and that would stick with me are the people who 
would have OCD for instance. It was sort of heart breaking, but it was pretty 
Page 5 of 5 
 
interesting.” He gives an example of a patient with OCD that he remembers. 
“People with secret lives were really interesting.”
