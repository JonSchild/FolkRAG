And on the seventeenth of March, 
The Irish concentrate ; 
A. bran new hat on each man's head, 
And a

The left foot first then lightly tread, 
In the Patrick's day parade ; 
Then two by two away we go, 
Up Broadway through rain and snow, 
We'd face the divil, friend or foe, 
In the Patrick's day Parade. 
CHORUS. 
We shout Imrrah for Erin-go-bragh, 
And all the Yankee nation, 
Stars and stripes and shamrock bright arrayed, 
The Irish shout, the girls turn out, 
To see the celebration, 
We march still as starch, 
In the Patrick's day parade.«

OH ! Itam a 
rale descindent of McMullin from Glenda11, 
For beauty and education the McMuliin's bate thtm all, 
The name is handed down from the days of Adam's time, 
Wid the greatest admiration, I 
claim the name as mine. 
CHORUS. 
For I 
walk wid stately tread, I 
keep up my noble head, 
I'm a 
cred:t to my country, Erin's Isle, 
McMullin is my name, without any fear or shame, 
I'd stand out here foruinst you in the rale McMullin style. 
My father often tould me to never tell a 
lie, 
I 
always help a 
beg.ar if I 
saw him pasiing by, 
Be free and iudepend-nt as a 
bird that fli:ts the air, 
Let my he irt be like a 
dove and my spirit like a 
bear. 
For I 
walk wid stately tread, etc. 
Shakespere's brain said there's nothing in a 
name, 
But he was a 
total stranger to McMullin all the while, 
For if he'd lived to-city, one thing he'd surely say, 
There's nothing can compare, my boys, to rale McMullin style. 
For I 
walk wid stately tread, etc. 
My father's blood is in my veins, and McMullin is my name, 
It's known from Ireland unto the river Nile, 
And when you have bad luck, don't cry out like a 
duck, 
But put your shoulder to it in the ride McMullin style. 
For I 
walk wid stately tread, etc.

Ned Harrigan's Vcrision of The Flags, 
Written by hint for JAmns 
• 
EACH nation has its heroes and monuments of fame, 
Every country ret.r(s1J1 el 1,y u 
thtg, 
The highest i 
oini of 1. em . 1
. they all try to attain, 
On the:r Nictory thcy're cert..in sure to brag; 
We had a 
bit of troubl in our grandfatlit.fs (lays, 
When we with our moil( r 
comnry went to Nvar, 
We teat their flag at Le:Mgt , a!so at Ifunker Hill, 
And drove the English re.dcf.ats from or clover, 
CIE ORT:S. 
Then here's to the flag of England, 
It's now a 
w,1;.'ome guest, 
It brings p€ace and good will to all men, 
North, south, cast and west. 
No doubt youv'e heard of Thomas Moore, and his poetry so 
grand, 
Dan O'Conned and Robert Emmett true, 
They nevi r 
lost affection to dear old Paddy's land, 
They did all mortal men could do, 
To throw off the chains of slavery, and set old Ireland free. 
They'd sacrifice the blood in their veins. 
They spoke for independence, and i 
eset liberty 
And the green where the red now reigns. 
Then here's the flag of Ireland, 
The harp and shamrock green, 
10 
'Twill wave yet over old Erin, 
Withont a 
king or queen. 
In Europe there's a 
nation made of niuscle end of brain, 
There to school the ch]dren have to go, 
And are taught to love their country, and keep its gloriorts 
name, 
An example to the world they show; 
They are an energttic and kind-hearted race, 
So we'll %s 
eicome the generous to our shore, 
Our libel ty my friends, they nie solid to the brave, 
And as citizens they'd obey the law. 
CIIOLUS. 
liwn here's the flag of Germany, 
May it alway3 shine, 
And wave aloft o'er helmet bright, 
That keep the Wacht am Rhein. 
The greatest nation on the ; firth that e'er the sun shone on, 
To ther countries it's a 
gliding star, 
It's our American Rs-pnUie, from Maine to Oregon, 
Where very stranger's welcomed jcyfully from afar; 
It's here the oppr sed and down-trodden come, 
To enjoy our institution with us iii' , 
It's the laLd of freedom, the home of Washington, 
And grant that she may never fall. 
CHORUS. 
Then here's the flag of America, 
Our bonny red, white, and blue, 
To the cause of freedom and rigb4

ALL AMONG THE ROSES, 
Poetry and Melody by W. II. DELEtiANTTe.. 
IN an Ivy-covered cottage, 
Hidden back of oaken trees, 
Lives a

Every summer's eventide, 
I 
sit amid the flowers fair 
Camilla by my side.

Making sweet proposes— 
Lovely, laughing, soul newitclibim 
Sweet Camila May; 
Captivating, aggravating, 
Never tired of play— 
Flitting like a

Happy, light and gay; 
Kill me or I'll die with love 
For sweet, Camillia May,

When in love you chance to be, 
Try and keep in all your feelings 
Not act foolishly like me; 
For I

Of a

When Fli make of one Camillia 
Such a

THE DUBLIN DANCING MASTER. 
Sung by Master BARNEY. 
IN Dublin city once there lived, 
A craythur gay an' hearty, oh ! 
A 
dancin' master he by tbrade, 
ills name was Teddy M'Carthx, oh 
Ile taught the girls and boys to dance, 
And none could do so faster— 
He always danced so nate and nice; 
Did this Dublin Danein' master. 
CHORUS. 
With his down the middle ! hands across! 
Go a 
little faster, oh, 
In an' out and round about 
The Dublin Danche niasther, oh ! 
t(")RES.-Mr. M'Carthy, allow me to inthroduce to yer notice 
dr. Cornelius Fitzpeithers Fltzfoozle O'Shaughnessy, a 
new pu-
pil. 
Oct), how do you do, sir, you're a 
pupill've had in my 
eye for many a 
day, and I 
assure you, sir, you could not put 
yourself in better hands for the practice of 3 
our feet. 
This is 
something of your style of dancin' I 
presume sir? (Dances a 
Spanish waltz.) Now, Sir, just thry that. (Imitates an awkward 
pupil.) 
Ali, sir, I'm afeard you'll nivir make a 
dancer; you? 
legs are not fellows; however, 
see if I 
can't cure you in time. 
Now TeUdy taught both reels and jigs, 
And all the other dances, 
From Highland fling to plain quadrille, 
To pleasc the ladies' fancies. 
Patsey Whelan, Mickey Flynn, 
And a 
boy called Kit McAsthor, 
Rem to learn a 
Highland fling 
From the Dublin dancin' mastber.

Mr. Patsey Whelan—Miss Ilonoria Wheelbarrow. Now, leediei 
and gintlemin, plase to teek yer places for a 
S..otch reel. (Dances 
Highland fling.) 
Thus Teddy got the boys and girls, 
Proficient in their dances— 
Polkas, jigs and schottisches, 
Mazourkas, reels and lancers, 
No matter what the dance he taught, 
None could ,.() it faster, 
And none could done an Irish jig, 
Liko tie Dtt an dancin' masther. 
Down the middle, ‘te. 
SPOKEN.---NOW leedies and gintiemin, teek your places for the 
ttextdance; you see how tine you're gettin on. 
Our family 
were always celebrated for their dancin' propinsities; my young-

jig before he was able to walk; and now fo? the next dance. 
(Dances Irish jig.)

As sung with immense success by Master GEORGE:A. 
M URRAY, 
the rising Young Comic. 
TO an evening party once I 
went and met such a 
nice young 
girl, 
Dressed oh, so fine and smothered in scent, my heart soon fell 
in a 
whirl, 
I 
asked her if she'd dance with me, she looked at me and smiled, 
She wouldn't say yes, she wouldn't say no, she'd quite a 
pee'. 
liar style,

First she would and then she wouldn't, 
Then she smiled and said she couldn't, 
Then she said, oh George, you shouldn't, 
You're a

But Ohl she wouldn't listen,

Oh! Love, ohl love, why don't you heed me,

COMING HOME FROM THE BALL. 
Written and Composed by Josarn P. S ELL.

THERE is no place so gay as the ball-room, 
When we're (lancing in dreamy delight, 
When the cares of the day never La.,1, us, 
In the flush cf the beautiful night, 
But the dawn puts an end to our glory, 
And the pleasure we dearly adore, 
We iiiu t 
part from the scene so enchanting, 
And go home 1 : oking slee: ,y 
and sore. 
SroxtN.—Yes we all know there 13 nothing more delightful 
than to go to a 
ball, and dance :111 night with a 
pretty girl, and 
eat expensive suppers, and flirt a 
1:ttle ia a

One will say, " Oh,

Some body else will yawn out very loud, 
"Dear me, I 
wish I 
was home." 
Another will complain of 
being chilly, and so on. 
And when we contemplate all this we 
naturally say to ourselves, 
Oh it's all very well to be waltzing, etc. 
All around us the music is floating, 
Light and gay as the bird's happy song, 
And we sigh when the last note is over, 
Tho' we know we've been dancing too long; 
We are lost in the gladness around us, 
And we heed not the hours as they fly, 
Till the light peeping in thro' the window, 
Makes us all bid each other good-bye. 
SPOKEN.— Yes, we must all say good-bye at last, while we 
eympothize with each other in our misery: and go home shiver-

On the way we all join together and 
give vent to our feelings thus— 
Oh it's all qery well to go waltzing, etc.

SOME ladies are not happy, 
When a

But wish that they were single, 
And grumble at their lot; 
I

And I

But there, I'll keep my spirits uf,

And see me to the play. 
And, perhaps, if he was very good, 
I'd let him stay a 
bit; 
While I 
was in the boxes 
lie might go in the pit.

TAKE IT, BOB. 
Written and composed by AliTIIUR LLOTD. 
\I 
PM a 
jolly old miller, Bob Bell is my name, 
And in my own village I'm well known to fame; 
I've a 
wifa and a 
daughter, a 
dear little ttss, 
I'm fond of them both, and Fin fond oft'a ;:; luss. 
Some say Pm too fond, well perhyps that may be. 
I 
try to be steady, and am as you see; 
:Int if I 
attempt to refuse a 
drink-a-day. 
I 
fancy the wheel of the mill seems to say,-
Criortus. 
Take It Bob, take it Bob. take it Bah, take it Bob, 
That's what I 
fancy the mill says to me. 
Take it Bob, take it Bob, take it Bob, take it Bob, 
Take it Bob. take it, its better than tea. 
I've tried very oft a 
tee-totler to be. 
But my mill i 
quite right, brandy's l)etter than tea; 
And attho' what I 
say, you may all rtink absurd; 
I 
believe \-- hat the mill says is right. ' Don my word, 
I 
called on Al Jon?,s, ' bout some te...iness -you know, 
And be aii. 
Rob, a 
pine and a ittss ' fore ye go; 
Now I 
didn't require it, believe what I 
sa.7, 
But altho' a 
mile off, I 
could 
‘
A  mill say,— 
', -„Ite it Bob, ctc.. 
43 
Now I 
dreamt t'other night that Bob Bell was no more,' 
That he'd died at the age of p'rhaps forty or more; 
And I 
heard people round me say, drinks done it's worst, 
But altho' I 
was dead, I 
was dying with thirst. 
A 
bottle of brandy close by I 
could see, 
It was meant for the mourners, it wasn't for me; 
But as on my lied, still and silent I 
lay, 
In the distance, distinctly I 
beard the mill say.— 
Take it Bob, lkc; 
I'm only up here for a 
bit of a 
spree, 
My wife thinks it -s 
business between you and me; 
And you know the old saying, that never deceives, 
What the heart doesn't see, why the eye doesn't grieve. 
I 
must toddle at once, so good bye to ye all, 
Next seasen I 
hope I 
shall give ye a 
call; 
Don't ask me to drink when I'm going away, 
Or I'm certain to fancy I 
hear the mill say, 
Take it Bob.

Many men like me, as you will say, 
Tho' not so bad as stated. 
About the little village T

Tho' a

Of the present, of the present day.

Tho' I'm not so bad as some people say; 
If I

I'm not such a

Now and then at Billiards I've a

In a

At Music- Mils' sometimes I

Or else at the Casino. 
A

By the fast young men of the present day; 
Of the present, of the present day. 
For I

find myself in togs and tiles, 
My ties and crabs providin', 
A.nd if I 
have to go two miles— 
A 
handsome cab I 
ride in; 
The cost of washing linen I 
of course defray, 
For a 
nobby-
looking shirt, I 
take pride in,

WEDDING OF BIDDY M'GRANE. 
As sung by MILES MORRIS. 
I'LL sing yon a 
song if yeu'll listen awhile, 
Of a 
damsel so pretty, so charming, and witty, 
Who liv'd from tho City of Dublin a 
mile. 
On the road to Clondalk, in the Emerald Isle; 
Don't think for a 
moment Pin tipping the blarney, 
But search near and far and you might, search in vain, 
Front Donaghadee, to the banks of Killarney, 
And not find the equal of Biddy "M'Grane. 
A 
fine hearted genuine son of the soil, 
One Larry Molloy, a 
broth of a 
boy, 
Who knew what it was for his living to toil, 
On a 
neat bit of land of his own at Babloyle; 
And Larry for marriage felt no inclination, 
But love is a 
thing that ye cannot explain, 
And enters your heart without hesitation, 
So Larry was smitten with Biddy M'Grane. 
Now Larry was fond of a 
jig, the spaipeen, 
lie went to the fair and Biddy was there, 
And strolling up to the pretty Colleen, 
Soon led her out for a 
dance on the green; 
The blink ol her eye was near driving him crazy, 
lie axed her consent hut she look'd with disdain, 
But when the bold Larry, he trampled the daisy, 
It melted the heart of Biddy M'Grane. 
The day of the wedding the girls and the boys, 
And friends were invited, and highly delighted, 
The Lannigans, the Brannans, the Burkes, and Molloys, 
Were all in there glory, with fun and with noise; 
51 
Miss Morgan she came along with Dan Brady, 
In a 
new suit lid bought from old Petticoat Lane, 
And larry M'Guiness arrived with Miss Grady, 
To dance at the wedding of Biddy M'Grane. 
The feasting indeed it was mighty fine, 
There-was bacon and cheese, potatoes and peas, 
And lashings of Patheen, in place of the wine, 
Biddy she look'd like a 
goddess divine; 
Attired as she was in her gorgeous apparel, 
In a 
new yellow kirtle of Muslin de laine, 
Ould Barney the fiddler on top of a 
barrel, 
Struck up " Garryowen" for Biddy M'Grane. 
The feasting concluded the dancing began, 
The Cairns, and the Gilligans, and the O'Howlag,ans, 
An of them leaped to there feet, to a 
man. 
And jigged it as only Irishman can; 
But when bould Jemmy Howlagan leaped on the table, 
I 
suppose 'twas the whiskey that fired his brain 
And roared " Cead mule Faltaigh " long as he was ablo,, 
Good luck and more power to Biddy MGrane. 
AN ILIS MAN'S WANT. 
As sung by M ILES Mourzs. 
ALL the way from Paddy's land. 
I've jist travell'd down, Sirs, 
To see the English quality 
It was I 
came to town, Sirs. 
To see the Queen I 
meant, 
Likewise the sweet princesses, 
All smother'd up with gold 
And jewels and fine dresses. 
Cnottus. 
For sure the Royal folk 
Poor Paddy wants to know, Sirs; 
To Erin's verdant Isle, 
He wishes they would go, Sirs. 
When I 
was on the Packet, faith, 
1 
wish'd I 
was on shore; 
For sure the ugly blackguards 
Had'nt fastened down the floor. 
But I 
came safe at last, 
And went out for an airing; 
But not a 
soul I 
saw 
Though I 
hurt my eyes with staring. 
For sure, ae. 
At last I 
met a 
Peeler 
By himself a 
struttin', 
With his ugly mouth brim full 
Of impudence and mutton. 
Says I, " My noble blue 
Where is all the people gone to ? 
But he only shouted out 
Now Irishman! move on do 1" 
For sure, &e. 
When I 
tipped him half a 
pint, 
He began to grin, sir, 
And told me that all the world 
Had travelled down to Windsor; 
To see a 
Princess wed 
To it noble Scottish Peer. 
Says I, " Such news, bedad, 
" 
Aint worth half a 
pint of beer," 
For sure, &e. 
" 
Now if you'd only told me 
" 
That an Irishman she'd wed, 
"At my expense my hearty 
"You might drink till you were dead. 
"I have no fear," says Bobby 
" 
That I 
still shall get my bread, 
For to marry Paddy 
" 
There's one remaining yet."

TO 
those who have never perused the sad story of CUA.Eft 
LOTTE TEMPLE, j 
oyed with her in her early pleashres, sym-
pathized and wept with her in her sorrows, and glowed 
with indignation at the wrongs which she suffered from 
base, calculating villains, an opportunity is afforded of 
reading one of the most absorbing works ever written, 
proving " truth stranger than fiction." 
The poet's lines are but a 
just description of the unfor 
ttmate Charlotte Temple: • 
Her form was faultless, and her mind, 
Untainted yet by art, 
Was noble, just, humane and kind, 
And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, all! the cruel spider came—" 
This book, in the language of Mrs. Rowsou, " affords a 
Itriking example that vice, however prosperous in the be-
ginning, in the end leads only to misery and shame."

THE DAUGHTER OF CHARLOTTE TERPLE. 
No one who has read the touching account of the 
misfortunes of Charlotte Temple, with that absorb-
ing interest which is inseparable irom Mrs. Row-
son's writings, can rest satisfied while denying them-
selves a 
perusal. cf the life of Charlotte Temple's 
Daughter, Lucy TE‘.mpli.-
,. 
It is a 
sequel possessed of all the thrilling in-
terest that characterizes the life of the unfortunate 
mother, while it exemplifies in a 
wonderful manner 
" 
the visitation of the sine of the parents upon the 
children." 
It depicts sorrows that refuse the balm of syni-
pathy, and consolations which those arcund us 
" 
can neither give nor take away." 
It contrasts in 
living colors the ri-lest fruits of virtue and. happi-
ness on the one hand, f4ncl the bitter end, blighting 
disappointmenis md rair resulting from once yidd-
ing to the seductive influence of passion. 
It points a 
moral that commends it to the atten-
tion of all, and is pervaded by an. interest that will 
hold the reader in rapt attention to the end.

A little book has I 
tely ,appeared in print at Messrs. Paler &

say that we recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen reader 
PS We think it would only encourage the bad habit of "flirting.. 
'Unfortunately there is enough of it done without any 2urther nec: 
sity of explaining 'how, when and where to do it," and this little 
rolume would advise and initiate the uncorrupted in piaetising what 
Is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: 
We have lately seen a 
neat little book, bound in morocco, costing 
25 cents, ca lod " The Little Flirt," published by _Messrs. Fisher & 
Denison, 98 Nassau street. 
It eives information of the mod us oper-
andi co: flirting, and of the meaning of every motion of the hand-
kerphief, fan, glove and parasol. As there is nothing at all chjec-
tionahle in the volume., and its contents might afford .-orne hInocent 
amusement to many, we do not hositat,: to recommend it to out 
young lady and gentlemen readers.

THE APPRENTICE, 
on 
First Book for Mechanics, Machinists & Engineers 
By OLIVER BYRNE. 
12mo., cloth. $ 1.50. 
ENDORSEMENTS OF THE PRESS. 
The highest praise which can be given to this excellent 
elementary work on practical mechanics, consists in the fol-
lowing simple statement of facts : The editor of this journal, 
while teaching natural philosophy- and chemistry in the 
Cooper Institute from 1859 to 1864, was in need of a 
text-
boo ., 
of practical mechanics, adapted to the advanced classes 
who had been trained in mathematics ; in his search among 
the many mechanical text- books, there was not one which so 
fully answered his requirements as the above work. 
It was 
theref ire adopted and used with perfect satisfaction, and it 
is with pleasure that he receives it now as an old friend from 
the publishers, gives it his most ea.-nest recommendation, 
an'. wishes it in the hands of all who are still in the fog about 
the units of work, calculation of the power of machinery, 
resistance to motion, strain on material, etc.—.11anttfacturer 
and Builder, July, 1874. 
ne author of this work is well known as an extensive 
wiiter who has made some valuable additions to American 
technical literature, enumerated above in detail. 
The work 
we are now noticing is a 
theoretical treatise on practical me-
chanics, designed to supply a 
recognized deficiency. 
Most 
of the works on mechanics treat the subject in a manner 
which is not avai1able to young men commencing as appren-
tices in shops. 
Any young mail with a 
fair know.e,Ige of 
arithmetic may, however, use this work to great advantage ; 
it is not only suitable for a 
text- hook, but also as a wink 
of reference. 
Most ambitious young men will make them-
selves so familiar with its contents as to be able to rtier 
readily to any portion of the book-. The author has adopted 
a 
new notation to di-tingui,h units of work from other units, 
which is not without value, and might be advantageously 
intro laced into more ambitious works. 
The book is well 
printed on good white paper, and bound in -t 
.
:t1 cloth covers.
