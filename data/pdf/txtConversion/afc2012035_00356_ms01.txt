Dougie Freeman - West End Salon.   Provincetown, MA

Provincetown is located about an hour from Cape Cod. It’s a small, remote 
seaside town that has been a mecca for gay people for many decades. It’s a 
festive town with throngs of tourists walking the streets. West End Salon is 
located right on the main street with restaurants and retail shops. It was so 
congested it was difficult to drive down the street because there were people 
walking right in the middle of the street with the cars. Traffic moved at a 
walking pace. There was no street parking so we parked behind the salon, but 
had to get permission from the tenants upstairs before we left the car.  
 
We walked into the West End Salon at noon. Dougie found a quiet place 
across the street where we could conduct the interview. We walked our 
equipment and a few chairs from the salon across the street and down a 
driveway into what appeared to be an empty apartment with a loft.  
 
Interviewing Dougie was unlike other experience I have had. When he spoke 
he closed his eyes and talked in a rhythmic cadence with such eloquence and 
concentration it was almost as though he was channeling the words. It was 
heartbreaking to hear about his struggles of being a young gay teen living on 
the streets in Boston.  
 
After the interview we walked back to the West End Salon and I took photos of 
the washroom where there were many signed photographs of celebrities on the 
walls. During that time Dougie’s model, who is also a drag queen, arrived. She 
signed the consent forms and Dougie recommended that we do the photo 
shoot downstairs. His client was very tan and wore large fake feather eyelashes. 
Dougie styled her wig while she talked about the parade that she was 
performing in the following day. The photography session lasted less than an 
hour. We left around 3:00pm.
