Mr B A Botkin The Library of Congress Washington, D C
Dear Mr Botkin:
I am glad you liked the records by Bus Ezell. He has recently composed two new War
songs, in which he uses the same tune, but has different words as compared to “Strange
Things are Happening in this Land.” Mr James will hardly be available for carrying on more
of this recording until the opening of our Summer School here on June 7th.
We have people here who might make good recordings if the work must be finished by
May 30th. Bus Ezell lives out in the country near us, but Buster Brown, when last heard
from, was in Cordele, and it may be difficult to locate him before Mr James arrives on the
scene.
Please let me hear from you.
Sincerely yours, H. M. Bond H M Bond
