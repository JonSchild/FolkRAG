NOTICES OF THE.PRESS. 
TITE NEW IhnEmucox.—By general and universal consent the exhi-
bition now in this city and showing nightly at Frank's Hall is conceded 
to be the best moral and instructive entertainment ever seen in the West. 
To those who do not understand what the Hibernicon really is, we would 
say it is a 
new and first-class panorama of all the principal places of 
interest in the Emerald Isle. 
The panorama itself is worth double the 
price of admission to see, in addition to which there is presented with 
nearly every picture a 
laughable comedy or an amusing scene depicting 
Irish domestic character, interspersed with songs and dances. 
The panorama, which is entirely new, is divided into three parts ; 
first, a 
Tour of Dnblin and Tour of Wicklow, Tour of Cork and Killar-
ney, and a 
Tour of the North and West of Ireland. 
It is an entertainment which none should fail to attend. 
It is in-
structive, amusing, and worth ten times the price of admission. 
Every 
one in Kansas city should see the new Hibernicon.—Kansas City Times, 
Feb. 23, 1880. 
MacEvoy's Hibernicon opened for a two weeks' exhibition at the 
Temple last night. 
Since its last presentation here many improvements 
have been added. 
The excellence of the panoramic views has noticeably 
increased, and while these of themselves for scenic effect possess a 
pecu-
liar interest to all lovers of painting, not speaking of the enthusiasm 
which such an exhibition must excite in the hearts of those who still 
love to travel back and be once more among the green hills and fertile 
valleys of the Emerald isle, the introduction of eminent characters and 
vocal artists between the views relieves the monotony, if such possibly 
exists, and constitutes in all a 
very excellent and pleasing entertainment, 
—0. Louis Times, Jan. 15, 1SSO. 
MACEVOY'S IIIBERNICON TO-NIGHT.—This pictorial, musical and na-
tional entertainment will be exhibited to-night in the Opera House. 
It 
is not the panorama which was presented here several years ago, but ( the 
proprietor says) is entirely distinct from the former one, being fuller and 
much handsomer. The series of paintings represent a 
Tour in Ireland, 
or Ireland in America. We learn from our exchanges from New Orleans, 
Mobile, and Montgomery that it was witnessed by large houses in those 
cities, and received with much pleasure.— Columbus, Ga 7 Enquirer, Dec. 
20, 1879. 
The largest audience we have ever seen congregated in the Opera ' 
House gathered last evening to witness the performance of MacEvoy's 
Hibernicon Troupe. 
The crowd was immense. 
hundreds went away 
for want of even standing room. A more delighted audience is not 
readily met with. 
The performance consists of a 
very fine panoramic 
display of historic scenes in Ireland. 
Many of them are familiar to the 
cis-Atlantic sons of " Ould Erin." There is a 
wide versatility in the char-
acter of the scenes which adds much to the general interest of the enter-
tainment. The scenery was explained to the audience by MacEvoy 
himself in a 
pleasant and intelligible manner.—Xadison( Wis.)Dernocrat.

IRISH SONG.

LEO (3NO. K.

Ant:— ' I 
remember, I 
remember.'

Eva! when the gentle moon is watching from on 
high, 
And when the stars, like golden gems, are sparkling in 
the sky, 
I 
will meet thee, I 
will meet thee, in the lonely sham-
rock dell, 
And I'll sing to thee, ma colleen Lawn, the song you love 
so well. 
The love I 
bear you in my breast is faithful still, and 
true, 
As when my lips unfolded first the secret unto you— 
But, oh 1 
its deep intensity, n o 
words of mine can tell ; 
So, darling, then 
breathe it in the song you love so 
well. 
Oh ! many a 
moon has filled and waned since I 
met thee 
before, 
Still in my bosom thou'rt enshrined, as in those dalcs of 
yore, 
When the zephyr sighed so softly, and the evening 
shadows fell, 
' 
And first I 
woke for thee, astliore, the song you love so 
well. 
And years may fill the tide of life tEl youth appears a 
dream ; 
Yet I 
will cling to thee, my love, with fondness just the 
same 
As in that summer evening, in the lonely shamrock 
dell, 
When first my vows I 
whispered in the song you love 
so well.

So far away from old Ireland and Katie, from you, 
The winter is on but I 
heed not its cold, dear, 
The spring will bring flow'rs and joy to my heart, 
Oh! for it's nearing the time when ill bring my love out here, 
Then in this free emuitry our new lives we'll start. 
She's the dear, cf;:c. 
The fields here, are green as they are in old Ireland, 
And all have their freedom to do what is right ; 
Ali! Katie, I've seen pretty girls, by the thousand, 
And I'm thinking of none but you, darling, to- night. 
When the bright summer comes, I 
will hasten, sure, back again 
Take your soft tender hands gently in mine.

Pat O'Brien it is my name, I'll tell you, boys, from whence 1

Ould Ireland is the place I

No country is so dear to me as the litola Isle stands near the 
sea, 
Where all the boys are blithe and free, deny it if you can. 
Ould Ireland is the place where they're famed for fun and 
mirth, 
It's equal can't be found if you search all o'er the earth; 
Good natured boys and girls are there, with none of them you 
can compare. 
Where every heart is free from care, that makes an Irish boy.

Dim O'Connell, ould Ireland's friend, lie struggled hard for to 
defend, 
Gainst all invaders who did' intend to claim poor Paddy's land. 
lie advocated Ireland's right with all his main and all his 
might, 
And he was poorly recompensed for all his toil and pains, 
In high courts of justice he caused them all to stare, 
With his knowledge, wit, and humor, to hear him it was rare; 
Ile always proved poor Paddy's friend when to his trial he did 
attend, 
lie caused the noblest back to bend to the honest Irishman. 
Pat O'Brien, d:c. 
In eighteen forty-four gone by, our countrymen they had to fly, 
For famine stared in every eye along ould Ireland's shore; 
They to America did sail, leaving their wives and babies to 
wail; 
They were determined not to fail, but their hardships endure. 
The harp that once through Tara's Halls, shall strike each chord 
again, 
To welcome back those called from across the raging main, 
May peace and plenty ever be to our little Isle that stands near 
the sea, 
And all our toasts be, 'Ireland free t 
and you'll be happy then.

TEDDY'S SPRIG OF SHILLELAU. 
:I'm a 
comical fellow,' tell you no fib, 
And I 
come from the bogs of Killaley; 
You may see I'm the thing, by the cut of my jib, 
And they christened me Teddy O'Rielly; 
I 
asked dad for a 
fortune, he answered so smart. 
He'd got none for himself, so none could he part. 
Spoken. — And so, d'ye see, I 
began the *world with an 
Irish estate—that's a 
true honest heart. 
And a 
snug little sprig of shillelah. 
Dad's blessing along with me, off then I 
goes; 
Success to the bogs of Killaley; 
And Erin go bragh was the motto I 
chose, 
Like a 
sound hearted Teddy O'Rielly ; 
For if she did not flourish, what good could I 
do ? 
Och ! 
and then for her friends, I've a 
heart warm and true 
Spoken.— And, as for her enemies, och! to be sure now, 
and I 
wouldn't give them a 
hand ! Och 1 
yes, but I 
would, 
and along with it, too 
A nate little sprig of shillelah. 
Then 1 
came to this town. where the world's all alive, 
Success to the bogs of Killaley; 
And soon I 
learnt how many beans go to five, 
What a 
wonderful Teddy O'Rielly ; 
My pockets were empty, my heart full of glee, 
Och I 
that was meat, drink, washing, lodging to me. 
Spoken.— And then the young vargins ! och ! to be sure, 
and 1 
didn't make a tew conquestesses. and the laurels, 
my dear jewels, the laurels ; arrah ! and is it the laurels 
you're alter meaning now ? 
Och! the laurel that bangs a1, creation for me, 
Is 
a 
tight little sprig of shillelah.

PADDY IS THE BOX" 
It's some years ago, I 
very well know, 
Since I 
first saw day-light with my two blessed eyes; 
I 
was born, so they say, when my Dad was away, 
On St. Patrick's day, in the morning. 
How they nursed me with joy; said : what a 
fine boy! 
Put a 
stick in my fist, by the way of a 
toy ; 
Faith ! there's no mistake, they admired my make, 
And said some day I'd give the girls a 
warming. 
For, Paddy is the 
Paddy is the boy 
Dear Old Dublin 
And Donnybrook 
boy that's fond of a 
glass, 
that's fond of a 
lass! 
is the place for me, 
is the place to go for a 
spree. 
At 2. wake or a 
fair, poor Paddy is there; 
He will fight foe or friend, if they do him offend; 
Let the piper strike up, he will rise from his cup, 
With a 
smile on his face adorning. 
With his little Colleen, he'll dance on the green, 
Sure, an Irishman, there, in his glory was seen 
Play a 
reel or jig, he don't care a 
fig 
But he'll dance till day-light, in the morning. 
For, Paddy is the boy, (
ko 
Now boys, do you mind; you never will find, 
Such a 
dear little place as the Emerald Isle; 
Long, long, maw it stand, and good luck to the land, 
That dear Old St. Patrick was born in! 
May the girls, young and old, may the boys, brave aaLI 'wad. 
unite, heart and hand, to protect the dear Isle! 
And, morn. noon and night, may joy and delight 
Banc on them, like a 
fine Summer's morning.

Who'd scorn to wear a

While I 
relate the matchless fate of bold Jack Donohoe.

From Ireland was transported, and deprived of his liberty. 
There was McNamara., and. Underwood, Bill Colbe and Wins-

With me hele kern hale, &c. 
The likes of Bold Jack Donohoe was not in this country, 
From maintaining of the people's laws, he fought so man.

Shall submit to British slavery, or ever be a

(Recitation; 
Written for the Original " Ilibernicon" by Hum' 7tonnieobr, SaP 4rwani• 
cbico, 
Up from a 
valley where beauty's smile, 
In that gem of the ocean, the Emerald Isle, 
The clustered spires of Conamara stand, 
Green- walled by the hills of Ireland. 
Fields of grain o'er the valley sweep. 
And honest toilers everywhere you meet ; 
it was years ago, in ninety-eight. 
"When the world wept for poor Emmett's fate. 
'When guilty Morbury from vengeance fled, 
Fitzgerald fought and glorious Wolfe Tone bled; 
When an aged hand struck for Ireland's weal, 
And flashed in defiance her native steel. 
Kate O'Connor four- score years and ten, 
Waved the Emerald banner hi the lion's den ; 
Bravest of all when the Red Coats came, 
And the imn stood back with a 
blush of shame. 
She nobly stood in her cottage door ; 
Write on her tomb ' true to the core ;" 
Up the street came the soldiers' tread. 
With a 
scion of Britain riding at their head. 
From under his plume of red and white. 
Ile glanced, and the flag of Erin met his sight ; 
Halt! Each one holds his 'breath, 
And awaits the order that sends withering death 
To the noble soul in the cottage door, 
With the waving gem at the shamrock shore. 
00, 
KATE O'CONNOR,—[CONCLUDED. 
Fire—ontblazed the leaden blast, 
It rent the banner from her feeb:e grasp. 
But ere it reached its native soil 
Kate O'Connor, who did not recoil, 
Raised it up with a 
loyal will, 
And spoke in tones that were clear and shrill, 
"Shoot if you will this old grey head; 
This flag don't fall until I 
am dead." 
A shade of sadness and a 
blush of shame, 
Over the face of the Briton came. 
The very soldiers gave a 
heartfelt sigh, 
When they saw their bullets had passed her by. 
The leader turned and in a 
quiet tone 
Bade his soldiers to go marching on. - 
The soldiers passed, and that green flag tossed, 
Over the head of King George's host. 
And ever it's green folds rose and fell 
Over The head of her who loved it well. 
Kate O'Connor's work is o'er, 
And Britain's leader is no more. 
Honor to her: and o'er her grave 
That flag triumphant yet shall wave. 
When the cry " to arms." comes for Erin's ‘veal, 
Midst the thunder of cannon and clash of steel. 
Her spirit will hover o'er the fight. 
Blessing those who strike for Ireland's right. 
And when Erin's struggle is at hand 
Thousands will flock from every land. 
Heroes will rise on every shore, 
And swear Erin's Isle free for evermore.

Weaving spells around my numbers, 
From the music of thy streams.

In that spacious azure dome, 
Only knows how much I

My own queenly island home, 
Only knows how much I

My own queenly island home. 
Through the veil that shrouds thy story, 
In my visions I 
can see 
Fairy gleamings of the glory 
That so long o'er-shadowed thee; 
Still its rays come flashing o'er me, 
For no matter where I 
roam 
Thou art evermore before me, 
My own queenly island home, 
Thou art evermore before me, 
My own queenly island home. 
Pure and lovely I 
behold thee, 
As thou wert in days of yore, 
Ere the traitor knaves had sold thee, 
And thy fruitful vales mastore, 
When the sun-burst flashed above thee, 
On each castle tow. t. and dome, 
When it was no crime to love thee, 
My own queenly island home, 
When it was no crime to love thee.

THE BRIGADE AT FONTEN01. 
11th May, 1745.) (By BARTHOLOMEW Duly-ton 
By our camp-fires rose a 
murmur 
At the dawning of the day, 
And the tread of many footsteps 
Spoke the advent of the fray; 
And as we took our places, 
Few and stern were our words, 
While some were tightening horse-girths, 
And others girding swords. 
The trumpet blast has sounded 
Our footmen to array — 
The willing steed has bounded, 
Impatient for the fray— 
The green flag is unfolded, 
While rose the cry of joy : 
" 
Heaven speed dear Ireland's banner, 
To-day at Fontenov!' 
'We looked upon that banner, 
And the memory arose. 
Of our homes and perished kindred, 
Where the Lee or Shannon flows; 
We looked upon that banner, 
And we swore to God on high, 
To smite to-day the Saxons' might, 
To conquer or to die! 
Loud swells the charging trumpet..., 
'Tis a 
voice from our nan land— 
God of battles—God of vengeance, 
Guide to day the patriot's brand; 
There are stains to wash away— 
There are memories to destroy. 
In the best blood of the Briton, 
To-day at Fontenoy. 
Plunge deep the fiery rowels, 
In a 
thousand reeking flanks-, 
Down chiva'ry of Ireland, 
Down on the British ranks—. 
BRIGADE AT FONTENOY. [CoxcLunap. 
Now shall their serried columns 
Beneath our sabres reel— 
Through their ranks, then, with the war-horse, 
Through their bosoms with the steel. 
With one shout for good King Louis, 
And the fair land of the vine, 
Like the wrathful Alpine tempest, 
We swept upon their line— 
Then ran along the battle- field, 
Triumphant our hurrah ! 
And we smote them down, still cheering: 
" 
ERIN, SLANTIIAGAL GO BRAWL 
As prized as is the blessing 
From an aged father's hp— - 
As welcome as the haven 
To the tempest- driven ship— 
As dear as to the lover, 
The smile of gentle maid— 
Is this day of long sought vengeance 
To the swords of the Brigade. 
See their shattered forces flying, 
A 
broken, routed line— 
See England, what brave laurels 
For Your brow to- day we twine! 
Oh! thrice b!essed the hour that witnessed 
The Briton turned to flee 
From the chivalry of Erin, 
And France's " 
FLEUR DE LIS!" 
As we lay beside our carnr-fires, 
When the sun had passed away, 
And thought upon our bre,thren 
Who had perished in the fray— 
We prayed to God to grant us, 
And then we'd die with joy, 
One day upon our own dear land 
Like this of Fun tenoy!

Well, the green curtain drew up and a

"

When in comes Pizzaro with a 
grunt like a

For the audience came down with showers of applause.

Each day we break our bread, 
Good-bye, Daniel dear, eto. 
So now I

I'll be soon sending home 
The money for my brother Dan, 
To come across the foam. 
Good-bye, Daniel dear, etc.

To watch the scenes below:

Where first the daisies sprung: 
The creaking old mill is still, Maggie. 
Since you and I

And now we are aged and gray, Maggie. 
And the trials of life nearly done: 
Let us sing of the days that are gone, Maggie, 
When you and I 
were young! 
A 
city so silent and lone, Maggie, 
Where the young and the gay and the best, 
In polished white mansions of stone, Maggie, 
have each found a 
place of rest, 
Is built where the birds used to play, Maggie, 
And join in the songs that were sung. 
For, we sang as gay as they, Maggie, 
When you and I 
were young! 
And now we are aged, &a. 
They say I 
am feeble with age, Maggie, 
My steps are less sp:ightly than then: 
My face is a

But time alone was the pen!

THE HARP 
THAT ONCE THRO' TARA'S HALLS. 
The harp that once thro' Tara's halls 
The soul of music shed, 
Now hangs as mute on Tara's walls 
As if that soul had fled. 
So sleeps the pride of former days, 
So glory's thrill is o'er, 
And hearts that once beat high for praie., 
Now feel that pulse no more. 
No more to chiefs and ladies bright 
The harp of Tara swells ; 
The chord alone, that breaks at night, 
Its tale of ruin tells. 
Thus freedom now seldom wakes; 
The only throb it gives

Lesbia bath a 
beaming eye, 
But no one knows for whom it beameth ; 
Right and left its arrows fly, 
But what they aim at no one dreameth. 
Sweeter ' tis to gaze upon 
My Nora's lid that seldom rises; 
Few it looks, but every one, 
Like unexpected light, surprises. 
Oh, my Nora Creina, dear, 
My gentle, bashful Nora Creina, 
Beauty lies 
In many eyes, 
But love in yours, my Nora Creina 
Lesbia wears a 
robe of gold, 
But all so close the nymph bath lac'd it, 
Not a 
charm of beauty's mould 
Presumes to stay where nature plac'd 
Oh, my Nora's gown for me, 
That floats as wild as mountain breezes, 
Leaving every beauty tree 
To sink or swell as heaven pleases. 
Yes, my Nora Creina, dear, 
My simple, graceful Nora Creina, 
Nature's dress 
Is loveliness— 
The dress you wear, may Nora Creina, 
Lesbia had a 
wit refined, 
But when its points ar gleaming round us, 
Who can tell if they're desig,n .d 
To dazzle merely, or to wound us ? 
Pillowed on my Nora's heart 
In safer slumber Love reposes— 
Bed of peace ! whose rou ,hest part 
Is but the crumpling of the roses. 
Oh, my Nora Craina, dear, 
My mild, my artless Nora Creina, 
Wit, tho' bright. 
Hath no such light 
A warms your eyes, my Nora Creina. 
SWEET KATE O'SHANE. 
There's a 
lass of beauty rare, 
With blue eyes and golden hair, 
One who meets me often in the shady lane; 
And she l'Ives me well, I 
know, 
Though she never told IT e 
so, 
And I 
know I 
dearly love sweet Kate O'Shane. 
There's a 
charm about the girl, 
More than dainty eye or curl, 
More than all that lover's fancies may beguile; 
"f is a 
good and loving heart, 
That from me will never part: 
can read it in her happy, truthful smile. 
CHORUS

Come then sadness, or come :, oy, 
There's a

For the hearts that ever trust each other so. 
Those blue eyes may gently fade, 
As we go down earth's fair glade. 
And the soft hair lose its tint of brightest gold, 
Yet along life's varied strand, 
As we wander hand in hand, 
We shall never, never let our hearts grow old.

WHAT WILL YOU DO, LOVE I° 
What would yon do, love, when I 
am going, 
With white sails flowing tilt: seas beyond, - 
What will you do, love, when waves divide Ix, 
And friends may chide us for being fond ? 
Tho' waves divide us and friends bt. chiding, 
In faith abiding I'll still be true, 
And I'll pray for thee on the sto 
locum, 
In deep devotion—that's what VI! do. 
What would you do, love, if distant tidings, 
Thy fond confidings should undermine, 
And I 
abiding 'neath sultry skies, 
Should think other eyes were as bright as thine? 
Oh! name it not !—tho' guilt and shame 
Were on thy name—I'd still be true I 
But that heart of thine should another share it, 
I 
could not bear it—what would I 
do ? 
What would you do, love, when home returning, 
With hopes high burning, with wealth for you, 
If my bark which bounded o'er foreign foam, 
Should be lost near home—ah! what would yoa do ? 
So thou wert spared, I'd bless the morrow, 
In want and sorrow, that left me you 
And I'd welcome thee from the wasting billow, 
This heart thy pillow—that's what I'd do 1

Respectfully dedicated to Hon. Timothy McCarthy of San PT-amigo*, 
by his friend Dan Bryant. 
In Ballinahack there resides an ould man, 
That can handle a

spade or a 
pan, 
For his tinkering trade he's a 
beautiful plan, 
And his name is ould Paddy McCarthy. 
He rises at seven his work to begin, 
And he wallops away wid his sodder an tin, 
The girls wid their tay pots and kitties come in 
To be mended by Paddy McCarthy. 
On Fridays he goes to the market at Clare, 
Wid fresh lard on his brogues, and the same on his 
hair. 
He gets drunk and throws his hat in the air, 
Who wants to fight says old Paddy Mc earthy. 
One Shaun 0' Meaney a 
piper by trade, 
Who can chanter a

Swore a

Could wrastle ould Paddy McCarthy. 
One Dennis Gillomr,hly, a 
comical card, 
Wid a 
noddle as bald as a 
bladder of lard, 
Got jealous of Paddy from the way that he spar'd, 
So he challenged ould Paddy McCarthy 
They fought for two hours, but he murdered poor Mao, 
Wid a 
left handed skelp on the broad of his back. 
Paddy lay on the fioor like a 
coal porter's sack, 
God be good to ould Paddy McCarthy.

Every boy in the village will lay 9. bugrougue, 
Wid sorrow for Paddy McCarthy. .

Wid his budget and soddar in glory he lay,

TEDDY O'NEAL, 
I 
dreamt but last night, oh, bad luck to my dreaming! 
I'd die if I 
thought 't 
would come truly to pass— 
I 
dreamt, as the tears down my pillow were stealing, 
That Teddy was courting another fair lass. 
Oh. didn't I 
wake with a 
weeping and wailing / 
The thought of the grief was too deep to conceal. 
Ny mother cried, " Norah. child, what is your ailing?* 
But all I 
could utter was" Teddy O'Neal." 
I've been to the cabin he danced his wild jigs in, 
As love a 
mud palace as ever was seen ; 
Although it did serve to keep poultry and pigs in 
I'm sure it was always most iflegant clean. 
But now all about seems lonely and dreary; 
All sad, and all lonely, no piper, no reel, 
Not even the sun thro' the casement is cheery, 
Since 1 
left that dear darling, oh, Teddy O'Neal. 
Shall I 
ever forget when the big ship was ready ? 
The moment had come when my love must depart) 
I 
cried like a 
spalpeen, " Good-bye to you, Teddy I " 
With drops on my cheek, and a 
stone at my heart 
He said 'twas to better his fortune he's roaming, 
But what would be gold to the joy I 
should feel, 
If he'd only come back to me, honest and loving, 
Still poor, but my own dear Teddy O'Neal. 
SHAMUS O'BRIEN. 
As sung by Miss ANNIE hunt. 
Oh I 
sweet is the smile of the beautiful morn, 
As it peeps through the curtain of night, 
And the voice of the nightingale singing his tune. 
While the stars seem to smile with delight. 
Old nattr., ,ow lingers in silent repose, 
And tue sweet breath of summer is calm, 
While I 
sit and wonder if Shamus e'er knows 
How Bad and unhappy I 
am ! 
CHORUS. 
Oh I 
Shamus O'Brien, why don't you come home, 
You don't how know happy I'll be; 
I've but one darling wish, and that is that you'd come 
And for ever be happy with me] 
I'll smile when you smile, and I'll weep when you weep, 
I'll give you a 
kiss for a 
kiss, 
And all the fond vows that I've made you, I'll keep— 
What more can I 
promise than this ? 
Does the sea have such bright and such beautiful charms 
That your heart will not leave it for me 
! 
why did I 
let you go out of my arms, 
Like a 
bird that was caged and is free! 
Oh I hamus O'Brien, dre., 
Oh! Shamus O'Brien, I'm loving you yet, 
And my heart is still trusting and kind; 
It was you who first took it, and can you forget, 
That love for another you'd find? 
No! no! if you break it with sorrow and pain, 
I'll then have a 
duty to do; 
If you'll bring it to me, I'll mend it again, 
And trust it, dear Shamus, to you. 
Oh I 
Shamus O'Brien.

THE TIPPERARY MEN. 
OR, THE ROLLICKING IRISHMAN. 
Sung by Joirst-rr Roacn. 
So, boys, I'm here once more you see, and a 
story I'm going to 
tell; 
It's something new between, me and you, which an Irishman 
befell ; 
'Twas in the town of Liverpool, in a 
street I 
forget the name, 
But to pass the time in the chorus join, just while I 
sing the 
same. 
CHOIICS. 
His name was Pat—just think of that! and beat it if you can ; 
There's none so gay, both night and day, as a 
rollicking Irish-
man; 
Whack, whack, whack, hurroo, tiddy I 
dow de dow, 
Whack, whack, whack, hurroo, tiddy I 
dow de dow ; 
Oh, at a 
wake or a 
fair Nve'ro always there, the Tipperary men. 
Now the weather was cold, and this hero bold about for work 
did seek; 
He got a 
job to carry bricks at eighteen shillings a 
week ; 
He bouorht a 
hod for half a 
crown from a 
man named Mickey 
Burke, 
And Pat so gay the very next day at six o'clock went to work. 
Ws name was Pat, etc. 
They were building a 
house—*twas very high, but Pat didn't 
care a 
jot ; 
To his work got drilled, when his hod was filled, how quick up 
the ladder he'd trot ; 
He was going to the top about twelve o'clock, but whether ' twas 
frost or the rum. 
This hero bold he misted his hold, and down he came by the 
run. 
His name was Pat, etc. 
Now, as Pat down did go, he put his hand so, and; 
then a 
loud 
yell he gave ; 
He cried, " Och hone!" as down he came; " may the Lord my 
poor soul save!" 
He turned o'er and o'er when he reached the first floor, on his 
feet he then tried to jump, 
But his head first came down, and when near the ground he 
cried, " Now for a 
thundering bump I" 
His name was rat, eta 
THE IRISH STRANGEM. 
O. pity the fate of a 
poor Irish str anger, 
That's wandered thus far from his home 
I 
sigh for protection from want, woe and danger, 
But know not which way to roam. 
I 
ne'er shall return to ilihernia's bowers, 
For bigotry lath trampled her sweetest of flowers. 
That gave comfort to me in my loneliest hours, 
They are gone and I'll ne'er see them more. 
With wonder I 
gazed on von lofty building, 
As in grandeur it rose tor its lord ; 
With sorrow I 
beheld my own garden soon yielding, 
Its choicest of fruits for its board : 
But where is my father's low cottage of clay, 
Wherein I 
did spend many a 
long, happy day, 
Alas! has his lordship removed it away I 
Yes, it has gone, and I'll ne'er see it more. 
When nature was seen on the sloe- bush and bramble, 
Sit smiling in beautiful bloom— 
O'er field without danger I 
need to ramble, 
And lavish amidst her perfume ; 
Or range thro' the woods where the gay feather'd thamg, 
Did joyfully sing their loud-echoing; 
The days, then, of summer passed sweetly along, 
Now they are gone, and I'll ne'er see them more, 
When the sloes and the berries hung ripe on the bushes, 
I've gathered them on' without harm ; 
And gone to the fields where rye shorn the green — ...k
3setra 
Preparing for winter's cold storm. 
Or I've sat by the tiro tri a 
cold winter's night. 
Along with my friends tolling tales of delight, 
Those tales gave me pleasure, I 
could them invite, 
Now they are gone, shall I 
ne'er see them more l 
Bat Erin, sad Erin. it grieves Inc to ponder, 
On the wrongs of thy injured Isle ; 
Thy sons, many thousands deploring to wander, 
On shores off far away in exile. 
But give me the power to cross o'er the main, 
America might yield me some shelter from pain, 
I'm only lamenting whilst here I 
remain, 
For the joys that I'll rt.wer see more. 
Farewell then, Erin, and those I 
left weeping 
Upon her disconsolate shore; 
Farewell to the grave where my father lies sleeping, 
That ground I 
still dearly adore, 
Farewell to each pleasure t 
once had at home. 
Farewell, now a 
stranger in England I 
roam. 
Oz)ve my past joys. or give me a 
tomb; 
Yea, iz pity I

THE LADS WHO LIVE IN IRELAND: 
OR, WHERE THE APPLE PRATIES GROW. 
/fly name is Ned O'Manney, I

can plough, reap or mow; 
And, if I 
met a 
pretty girl, I

I've something more alluring, which perhaps you'd like to know: 
I'm none of your Bulgrudderies, nor other shabby families, 
But can unto my pedigree a 
pretty title show: 
Ohl I'm of the O's and Mac's, and likewise the sturdy Whacks, 
CHORUS. 
That live and toil in Ireland, where the Apple Praties grow; 
That live and toil in Ireland, where the Apple Praties grow. 
I

My Mother was a 
Hogan, but my Father I 
don't know; 
I've ninety-nine relations in a 
place they call Roscarberry, 
And each unto their name has a 
Mac or an 0; 
My Uncle was a 
Brallaghan, my Aunt she was a 
Qallaghan: 
And as to my character, why, I 
can plainly show : 
I'm a 
rantin' rovin' blade, and I 
never was afraid 
For, I 
was born in Ireland, dz-e. 
May Heaven still protect our hospitable Country. 
Where first I 
drew my living breath, and heard its cocks to crow° 
Adieu to its green hills and its lovely bay of Bantry ! 
Where many a 
pleasant evening, my love and I 
did go. 
Where shoals of fish, so pleasantly, did sport about so merrily, 
Beneath its glassy surface, their wanton tricks to show. 
Oh ! those scenes I 
did enjoy, like a 
gay, unthinking boy, 
With the lads who live in Ireland, & e. 
St. Patrick was our Saint, and a 
blessed man in truth, was he; 
Great gifts unto our Country he freely did bestow; 
He banished all the frogs and toads that sheltered in our Country 
And unto other regions it's they were forced to go : 
There is one fact undoubtedly, that cannot contradicted be: 
For, trace the Irish history, and it will plainly show; 
Search the universe all round, tighter fellows can't be found.

To wander alone by the wind- beaten hill. 
But the day-star attracted his eyes's sad devotion: 
For, it rose on his own native isle of the ocean, 
Where once, in the flow of his youthful emotion, 
He sang the bold Anthem of Erin go bragh. 
Oh! sad is my fate, said the heart-broken stranger,. 
The wild deer and wolf to a 
covert can flee, 
But I

'When I

I 
thought I'd go and join the line, 
And as a 
soldier cut a 
shine, 
In a 
lot called the Hungry Army. 
Said the sergeant you are just the chap. 
And placed a 
knapsack on my back, 
They sent me off to Ballarat, 
To fight in the Hungry Army. 
CHORUS. 
Sound the bugle, blow the horn, 
Fight for glory night and morn, 
Hungry soldiers, ragged and torn, 
Just returned from the army. 
March, boys, march, the way is on before us, 
Shout, boys, shout, and join us in the chorus, 
March, boys, march, the foe is still advancing, 
Cheer, boys, cheer, for the new and happy land. 
I 
went to drill on one fine day. 
The wind was rather strong that way. 
It fact it blew us all away, 
This glorious hungry army. 
I've got a 
medal as you see, 
The workhouse presented it to me, 
For hanging to a 
rotten tree, 
When the wind took the hungry army. 
Then sound the bugle, & C. 
They cut my hair with a 
knife and fork, 
And curled it with a 
cabbage stalk, 
And fed we on some cabbage broth, 
To fight in the hungry army. 
They served it out in a 
large tin can, 
A 
teaspoonful to every man, 
I 
got so fat I could'nt stand, 
To fight in the hungry army

They sent me out to drill recruits,

BECAUSE WE WERE POOR. 
Sung by GEORGE HUNTER. 
TKERE'S a 
dear spot in Ireland I 
long to see; 
It's my own native birth-place, and it's heaven to me. 
Sure my poor widowed mother lies there all alone, 
With my brothers and sisters. 
T'was- a 
bright, happy 
home. 
Sure, we hadn't much money, but my own mother dear-
To me gave her blessing, bade me heart be good cheer, 
Then the shadow of poverty darkened my door, 
And I 
left mother and Ireland, because we were poor. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my thought i 
oft go back to that dear little spot— 
To na,y brothers and sisters, and that thatched cot— 
To my poor widowed mother—I'll ne'r see he more. 
'Twas a 
shame 1 
but I 
left her because we were poor. 
I 
will never forget on that bright, rosy morn 
When old Ireland I 
left how my poor heart did mourn, 
When my blessed old mother said, " Be of good cheer 1 
Good-bye, Michael darling!" Farewell, mother, dear! 
Then my brothers and sisters took me by the hand 
And bade me do right when I 
left Ireland; 
Then I 
bade them good-bye at our cottage door, 
And left Ireland and mother because we were poor. 
Oh, my thoughts, etc. 
Since leaving old Ireland my poor mother's dead. 
" 
God bless and protect him !" were the last words she 
said, 
And the ring that my father gave she sent to me. 
'Tis a 
far dearer prize than bright gems could e'er be. 
And my bothers and sisters, I 
wish they were here, 
For I'm longing to see them; but they'll come, never 
fear. 
I've a 
neat little cot on America's shore 
Where happy we'll live, although we are poor. 
Oh, my thuoghts, eta.

OLD IRELAND, OUR COUNTRY. 
AIR:—" Wearing of the Green." 
Old Ireland, our country, shall soon her freedom gain, 
And from her weeping face shall wipe away the cruel stain, 
That England long has placed upon her once bright emerald brow, 
To strike the tyrant's shackles off—the time is coming now. 
Her homes have been torn from her, and her hearths are desolate, 
Her sons are in a 
dungeon, and her dangivers mourn their fate, 
But yet she'll rise triumphant, and smile again once more, 
And drive all foreign tyranny away from Erin's shore. 
For years the noble-hearted have mourned their country's wrongs, 
And vowed they would possess that land which to Irishmen belongs 
They nave gone across the ocean-wave to the country of the fr e, 
Though crushed their hearts, they still are brave and true will °vet 
DC. 
The love of their dear island-home is planted in each breast, 
And till they have it once again her patriots will not rest.— 
They have waited long and suffered much, and will not suffer more, 
But drive all foreign tyranny away from Erin's shore. 
/Then arise, unfurl your banner, and spread it to the breeze, 
Each son of Erin's isle, and all who've come across the seas! 
Strike, strike for liberty I 
that word to Irishmen so dear, 
And soon our country shall be free—the time is drawing near, 
Oh I 
Erin! dry your weeping eyes, your sons have drawn the sword, 
Which never Elia I 
be sheathed wzain till freedom is the word! 
For yet trinniphant yen shall rise and smile again once more, 
A.nd drive all foreign tyranny away from Erisee shore.

THE IRISH CUPID. 
Music by J. G. WARDER. 
Oh. Cupid is a 
native god, 
Erin is his mother, 
And Ireland is his own abode, 
lie never had another. 
In Blarney's groves the boy was bred, 
And buttermilk his pap was. 
Until with whiskey he was fed. 
Which raither a 
mishap was; 
For it made him so warm and hold, 
That still it is no wonder 
All great and small, and young and old, 
To Irish love knocks under. 
Och, love's an Irishinan's employ, 
And at it he's a 
genius, 
For Cupid is an Irish boy, 
Each Irish girl's a 
Venus. 
Love's blind and bare, I 
do declare, 
And lives upon pataties. 
Why he is so, if you would know, 
Why faith 
tell you gratis. 
Love made each Irish boy so bright, 
They soon found beauty's prize out, 
For which, poor urchin, out of spite 
The heathens tore his eyes out, 
And to be sure he'd never roam, 
And so deserve our loathing. 
Co keep love with us always at home, 
He took away his clothing. 
For love's an Irishman's employ, 
And at it lie's a 
genius, 
For Cupid is an Irish boy, 
Lath Irish girl's a 
Venus.

You're knocked about and called a

CHORUS. 
I

And the' richer land's I've seen. 
Yet I 
can't forget Ould Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
Poor Pat is often painted 
With a 
ragged coat and hat; 
His heart and hospitality. 
Has much to do with that. 
Let slanderers say what they will, 
They cannot, call him mean; 
Sure, a 
stranger's always welcome 
Where the grass grows green.

He's foolish, but not vicious, 
His faults I 
won't defend; 
His purse to help the orphan, 
His life to serve a 
fr!_end, 
He'll give. without a 
murmur— 
So, his follies try and screen; 
For, there's noble hearts in Erin, 
'Where the grass grows green. 
I 
love my, &O. 
'Tis true he has a 
weakness 
For a 
drop of something pure, 
But that's a 
slight debility 
That many more endure. 
He's fond ot fun, he's witty, 
Though his wit ' tis not too keen; 
For, there's feeling hearts in Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
I 
love my, &O. 
There's not a 
true-born Irishman, 
-Wherever he may be, 
But loves the little Emerald 
That sparkles on the sea. 
May the sun of bright prosperity 
Shine peaceful and serene, 
And bring, better days to Erin. 
Where the grass grows green! 
For I 
love my, &0.7.

THE RISING OF THE MOON. 
This song, which is the production of John B. Casey. " thE 
Galtee Boy," who was an inmate of an English dungeon, is 
immensely popular here, especially in the \Vest, where it is 
often made the marching tune of bodies of men eager to 
emulate the patriot example of the men of "OS. 
It is sung to 
the Air of: " Wearing of the Green ;" 
Oh! then, tell rue, Shane if Farrel, tell mewhere you hurry so? 
Hush, ma bouchal! husn and listen, and his cheeks were all 
aglow, 
I 
bear orders from the Captain : get you ready quick and soon 
For the pikes must be together by the risin' of the Moon. 
CHORUS. 
I3y the rising of the Moon, by the rising of the moon: 
For the pikes must be together by the risin' of the Moon, 
I 
bear orders from the Captain: get you ready quick and soon, 
For, the pikes must be together by the risin' of the Moon. 
Oh! then, tell me, Shane 0' Farrell, where the gatherin' is to be ? 
In the ould spot, by the river, right well-known to you and me. 
One word more: for signal- token. whistle up the marchin' tune, 
With your pike upon your shoulder, by the risin' of the Moon. 
By the rising of the Moon, &c. 
Out from many a mud-wall cabin, eyes were watching thro' 
the night, 
Many a manly heart was throbbing for that blessed warning-
light; 
Murmurs passed along the valley, like the banshee's lonely 
croon, 
And a 
thousand pikes were flashing by the rising of the Moon. 
By the rising of the Moon, ite. 
Down along yon singing river, that dark mass of men was seen, 
High above their shining weapons floats their own beloved green, 
Death to every foe and traitor! forward ! strike the marchin' 
tune! 
And hurrah, my boys, for Freedom! ' tis the rising of the Moon. 
'Tis the rising of the Moon, &c. 
Well they fought for poor Ould Ireland, and full bitter was 
their fate; 
Oh I 
what- glorious pride and sorrow fill the name of Ninety-
Eight!

Who will follow in their footsteps by the rising of the Moon.

CARAT YOUR FRIEND IN YOUR POCKET. 
I 
don't say it's right, but there's a 
saying quite true, 
If you've goodness at least 'twill shock it. 
It's that seitish expression " Mind number one, 
And carry your friend in your pocket." 
'Tis a 
palpable fact, and requiring great tact, 
Grim poverty's inroad to block it; 
For friendship's all fudge, and that you may judge, 
If you hav'ut a 
rap in your pocket. 
Whilst you're young and in health, by indua:N.y gain wealth. 
Your coffer you'll very soon stock it; 
After that yoa can go and be set aped and bowed to, 
As they know you've a 
friend in your packet. 
When * tis known you bare cash, why the veriest 
You utter, goes off' like a 
rocket ; 
You're a • brick' tho' a 
stick, and are liatter'd till sick. 
Thro' the friend that you've got in your pocket, 
But be poor and in want, and just ask for a 
loan. 
The need yon set forth they oft mock it. 
And say, • Ito sh.short,' or ' really I 
can't,' 
Or, ' I 
havn't as much in my pocket.' 
They say ' tis no sin, to be wanting in tin, 
The nerve of those needy, ' twill shock it, 
So wher'er you may roam, abroad or at home, 
Put our wily true friend iu your pocket. 
THE BIRTH OF SAINT PATRICK. 
On the eighth day of March it was, some people say 
That St. Patrick at midnight he first saw the day; 
While others declare ' twas the ninth he was born, 
And ' twas all a 
mistake between midnight and morn, 
For mistakes will occur in a 
hurry and shock, 
And some blamed the baby—and some blamed the cloak-
'Till with all their cross questions sore no one could know 
If the child was too fast—or the clock was too slow. 
Now the first faction fight in owld Ireland, they say, 
"Was all on account of 
t. Patrick's birth-day; 
Some fought for the eighth— for the ninth more woulcrdic 
And who wouldn't see right, sure they Idaeken'd his eye I 
At last both the factions as positive grew. 
That kept each a 
birth-day—soyat then had two, 
'Till Father Mulcahy, who showed them their sins, 
Said no one could have two birthda;„'s but a 
pair of twins: 
Says he, boys, don't be fighting for eight or for nine, 
flout be always dividing—but sometimes combine ; 
Combine eight with mime, and seventeen is the mark, 
So let that be his birthday,' 
Amen,' says the clerk. 
' 
If he wasn't a 
twin, sure our hisCry vlll show— 
That at last° he is worth two saints that we know!' 
Then thy all gut blind drunk—which completed their bliss, 
And we kept up the practice front that day to thio.

No:ie can lead a 
jollier life than Barney the Driver Lad. 
My father was a 
carrier, many years ere I 
was born, 
He used tc rise at day-break, and go his rounds each morn; 
And then he'd take me with him. especially in the Spring, 
l'd love to sit upon the car and hear my father sing.

I 
think I

To see your smiling faces, it makes my heart feel glad, 
So, drivers, treat your horses kind, like Barney the Dlivel

PADDY BLAKE'S ECHO. 
In the gap of Dunlo,

If you civilly spake 
how d'ye do. Paddy Blake,

One day Teddy Keogh 
With Kate Connor did go,. 
To hear from the echo this wandarful talk, air, 
But the echo they say 
Was conthrairy that day, 
Or, perhaps, Paddy Blake had gone out for a 
walk, sir. 
Now, says Teddy to Kate, 
Tis too hard to be bate 
By this deaf and dumb baste of an echo so lazy, 
But if we both shout 
To each other no doubt 
We'll make up an echo beween us, my daisy. 
Now Kitty says Teddy, 
To answer be ready, 
Oh, very well thank you, crivs out Kitty then, sir, 
Would you like to be wed: 
Kitty darling, says Ted, 
Oh, ver_c well thank you, says Kitty again, sr 
Do you like me, says Teddy, 
And Kitty quite ready, 
Cried, very well thank you, with laughter beguiling. 
I 
think you'll confess 
Teddy could not do less 
Than pay his resp cts to the lips that were smiling 
Oh, dear Paddy Blake, 
May you never f . rsake 
Those hills that return us such echoes endearing; 
And may girls all translate 
Their answers like Kate, 
No faithfulness doubting, no treachery fearing. 
And boys be you ready 
Like frolicsome Teddy, 
Be earnest in loving, though given to joking, 
And thus when inclined 
May all true lovers find 
Sweet echoes to answer fro hearts they're invoking,

Thady O'Flynn agin and agin, 
You said you loved me dearly, 
And sorra a 
bit I 
doubted it, 
I 
thought you loved sincerely; 
You said when we should married be, 
You'd make me quite a 
lady, 
But now I 
find you've changed your mind, 
It's ugly Norah Grady. 
At Phelim's wake I 
saw ye take 
Her hand with glances tinder, 
Tho' sorra a 
bit ye fancied it— 
I 
saw ye through the winder; 
Your arm you placed around her waist, 
Its little she did mind ye— 
You called her ' dear' right in her ear, 
I 
wish I'd been behind ye. 
Thady O'Flinn you vowed it thin, 
You'd make me quite a 
lady, 
But now I 
find you've changed your mind, 
It's ugly Norah Grady. 
THADY O'FLYNN—[CONCLUDED.] 
At Goolah fair, I 
saw ye there, 
Along with Norah Grady; 
It's sorra a 
bit ye fancied it, 
But I 
per6aived ye, Thady ; 
I 
pity your taste your love to waste 
On Norah so consaited, 
Why I 
declare your'e muttherin' there— 
As if you'd been ill-trated. 
There, go your ways, yourself to plaze, 
You only need be throublin', 
Ye think there's few as fine as you 
From here away to Dublin. 
There's Pat Malone at least you'll own, 
And Mike, and Clanty Brady, 
And Barney Bourke, and Terry O'Rourke., 
I'm not in earnest, Thady. 
Now, Thady dear, come sit ye here, 
And listen awhile to razin, 
It's sorra a 
bit I 
mind the chit, 
Sure I 
was only tazin. 
It's you're the one to throw your fun 
At ugly Norah Grady. 
Now don't begin and do it agin, 
Now thera's a 
darlio' Thady.

REST, DARLING, REST. 
Beside the streamlet in the vale, 
In dreamless sleep my Alaggie lies, 
Her warblii:g voice is bushed and still, 
And closed in death her azure eyes; 
Yes, hero we oftentimes tha meet, _ 
And sit beside the purling stream, 
But now she slumbers ' neat 11 my feet, 
And vanished is my happy dream.

Rest darling, rest, sleep dear one. sleep, 
Front care and sorrow thou art free. 
Though at thy grave, I 
grieve and weep, 
'T s

With broken heart I 
stand alone, 
And list to nature's plaintive slrain, 
And in each sad and plaintive tone, 
I 
seem to hear her voice again ; 
Though I 
be spared till out and gray, 
My Maggie I 
shall not forget. 
Supreme 1+ty love shall reign always, 
Until life's ruling sun shall set. 
Rest darling, ,ket.

Hurrah for the farm and plough!

Who dances best on the thire? 
If prizes were given for beauty, 
You'd take the best I 
am sure. 
Whose song is the best when the turn 
Comes to my Noralt to sing ; 
Jewel, you'd bate the bould robin, 
When he first welcomes the Spring. 
ffpoken.—Oeh, but you did cot the dash among them last nights 
That villain, Tim Ke7an, looked at me all as one as if he could ate me 
without a 
grain of salt, well, sure it's not my fault that you could not 
mar. y 
half a 
dozen of us, it's better, Norah, as it is, darlint. 
Norah. 
Dear Barney come, my darling., 
Our trials are over now; 
We've got my mother's blessing, 
How sweet is our p!ie-hted vow; 
I'll spin while you guide the plough I 
But promise never to go 
Away front Norah for long; 
For then I 
no more would spin, 
Nor think of a 
single song. 
With yon beside me ever, 
I'll face-a 
wito`e world of care; 
Preferring home where you are, 
To empty joys elsewhere? 
Spoken.—Yes Barney! AensIda! I 
feel I'm ready for anything. 
Fortune, or misfortune, while your strong arm is at ray side, and 
I your kind voice to cheer me. 
Together.

I'm dreaming of thee, Norah, rtn dreaming still of thee, 
Thy spirit haunts me ever, like fairy melody ; 
When in loneliness I 
wander, or in halls of mirth and glee, 
Ah I 
my heart to thine is turning, I'm dreaming still of thee. 
I'm dreaming of thee, Norah, 
I'm dreaming still of thee. 
I'm dreaming of thee, dearest, I 
dream of thee alone, 
I 
think how well I 
love thee, and feel we shall be one ; 
For I 
know there is no other, e'er can be so dear to me, 
ih 1 
when e'er I 
dream of Angels, I'm dreaming still of thee.. 
I'm dreaming of thee, Norah, 
I'm dreaming still of thee. 
'When the pure Fense of honor shall cease to inspire thee, 
And kind hospitality leaves thy gay shore ; 
When tlAe nations that know thee, no longer admire thee— 
Then, Eriu mavourueen, I'll love thee no more. 
When the trumpet of fame shall cease to proclaim thee. 
Of waPriors the nurse, in the ages of yore ; 
When ti:e muse, and the record of genius disclaim thee, 
Then, Erin mavourneen, I'll love thee no inure. 
When thy brave sons no longer are generous and witty. 
And cease to be loved by the fair they adore; 
When thy daughters no longer are virtuous and pretty—. 
Ti)e12. Erin mavourneen, I'll love thee po roore.
