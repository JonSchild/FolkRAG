Joseph's and my introductory visit with Father Konstantin 
Federov at Rova Farms' St. Vladimir's Russian Orthodox Church 
Outside of Russia became lengthy as Fr. Konstantin warmed to the 
task of 
introducing us to Russian—American culture, particularly 
from the perspective of religious affiliation. 
G—Rova Farms; 48GT 
Fr. Konstantin is the rector at St. Vladimir's. 
St. Mary's 
Orthodox Church of America in G—Rova Farms; 48GT also has a Russian 
congregation. 
It split from St. Vladimir's in 1947 over the 
issue of relationship with the Russian Orthodox Church in Russia. 
Fr. Konstantin's group regards that church as 
in complicity with 
or at least tolerant of the Communist government. 
This 
relationship shows up in specific events like the raising to 
sainthood of the Czar Nicholas and his family, who were 
assassinated. 
The Orthodox Church of America would not do this 
because of the church in Russia and 
its relationship to the 
government. 
The new saints are, conversely, highly important to 
the Russian Church Outside of Russia, and are depicted on a new 
and much lauded icon of the church. 
ethnicity 
We got a good view of how entwined religion and politics can 
be with community life. 
St. Vladimir's celebrates St. Vladimir's 
Day 
in commemoration of the Baptism of Russia, an important 
traditional festival. 
In Rova Farms on that day, St. Mary's 
recently began observing a day for Blessing of the Graves. 
In 
Fr. Federov's view, this was a sort of counter move to the 
significance and attraction of the traditional festival. 
Fr. 
said that the Blessing of the Graves is not traditional; I wonder 
if 
he meant that the observance of 
it on that day 
is not 
traditional. 
(celebration) 
It may be 
important, from several perspectives, to visit St. 
Mary's. 
Father described that congregation as being of the older 
families of the Rova Farms community, and explained their 
tolerance of the Soviets as attributable to their not having 
lived with Soviet persecution, as did the post—WWII refugee 
families, 
like his own. 
It seems to be Father's own mission to

and revival of traditional religious arts.

When we asked Father about taping and photographing a 
religious ceremony, he told us that they are trying to finish the 
church for the celebration of the millennium of Christianity in 
Russia. 
While the church has been 
in use for many years, the 
interior will not be complete until 1988 (?). 
An iconographer, 
Father Dimitri, has been contracted with to complete an 
iconostasis -- the screen separating the altar from the church. 
This will be the largest iconostasis in the country, and it wil 
include over one hundred icons. 
Father Konstantin and his son 
have also worked on the screen, painting icons as well as carving 
and doing gold leaf work. 
Until the screen is finished, the 
Bishop has not allowed pictures to be taken of the interior of 
the church. 
Father Konstantin is going to ask permission for 
to photograph the congregation and tape a ceremony, 
if the 
will not allow us to photograph the altar. 
The church was 
entirely by congregation members. 
Joseph took pictures of 
exterior. 
The motive for not having pictures taken before 
millennium in 1988 is to avoid upstaging what they hope to 
grand event. 
The most important community event is the celebration of 
Vladimir's Day on July 27. 
Father said that it has been 
proclaimed a legal holiday for Russian—Americans by the governors 
of New Jersey and New York. 
On that day they celebrate the 
baptism of Russia with vespers and matins the night before and 
the blessing of water the next morning in the church. 
After the 
Divine Liturgy, the congregation proceeds to the lake carrying 
icons and banners. 
Afterwards, there are festivities on the 
grounds, 
including a Russian dinner prepared by the members of

The church compound includes an Information Center which 
Father has arranged and furnished to represent a 200 year old 
Russian room. 
It contains many religious artifacts -- icons, 
prints, and icon towels, the embroidered cloth used ceremonially 
with the icon 
in the home. 
Father has made many of the icons 
there himself. 
There is an adjoining gift shop which has 
numerous other religious materials -- cards, calendars, books, 
and cast silver crosses which Father says are not available 
anywhere else outside of Russia. 
He and his son and a helper, 
Andrew, make these items. 
There are also available embroidered 
items, painted wooden and ceramic eggs, and literature about the 
Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia. 
On display were 
several paintings -- copies of classical Russian works -- done by 
his students. 
Joseph commented on the mushrooms hanging to dry

and crafts, gathering. 
There used to be a youth camp at Rova Farms. 
During his 
tenure there, Father has tried to 
involve the youth in the arts 
and crafts, and has sponsored many classes and programs. 
He has 
attempted to 
incorporate the study of Russian crafts into the 
regional school's continuing education program curriculum. 
He 
wants Rova Farms to be a place where the arts of Russia are 
preserved and created. 
Father came to the States in the 50s, after many years with 
his family in a displaced persons camp in Germany. 
There he 
watched iconographers at work. 
He has studied commercial art in 
the U.S. and worked in the field before becoming a priest fifteen 
years ago. 
He has always done religious art, as an avocation 
before his priestly vocation.

Valia Petrenko, G—Allentown, Upper Freehold TownshipGT, NJ 
(no municipality code), (609) 758-2098. 
Allentown is not in the survey area. 
Visually it 
is not 
Pinelands. 
Mrs. Petrenko's home is 
in an area of hills, winding 
roads, heavy deciduous woodlands, horse farms. 
As she explains, 
however, she 
is part of the community of St. Vladimir's in Rova 
Farms, and she gathers mushrooms in the "woods," 
in her words, at 
Browns Mills. 
Rova Farms 
is not too many miles from her home, 
perhaps ten or fifteen. 
Father Federov's wife suggested I talk 
to Mrs. Petrenko when I asked of her the name of a woman who 
belonged to the parish women's organization, St. Olga's 
Sisterhood. 
I wanted to talk about the preparations for St. 
Vladimir's Day Festival, a major event, as well as about the home 
arts of the Russian women 
in the area. 
Mrs. Petrenko is active 
in this group and talks readily and enthusiastically about both 
her own experiences and the parish activities.

Mrs. Petrenko greeted us outside the house. 
Perhaps she was 
watching for us, because we were quite late, having gotten quite 
lost! 
Her home 
is on a large piece of property, set back from 
the road, and surrounded by hilly, wooded terrain. 
The houses on 
that road are not close together. 
Each seems "independent," so 
to speak, rather than "neighborly." 
Behind the house they have a 
large garden which she describes somewhat near the end of the 
tape. 
The property appears well—used and lived in, as does the 
interior of the home. 
There were, 
in addition to the garden, a 
woodpile, discarded objects, and 
many kittens around the yard. 
(animal) 
As soon as we went into the house, we were also greeted by 
Mrs. Petrenko's mother, who wore a babushka or kerchief 
in a 
manner traditional for Eastern Europeans. 
While Mary got the 
equipment out of the car, Mrs. 
Petrenko showed me the ritual 
cloth or towel draped around a picture of the Last Supper hanging 
over the kitchen table. 
This 
is the room we entered the house 
Moonsammy--83 Fieldnotes

by, and 
it appears that they do not use the front door. 
(That's 
where Mary and I were standing when Mrs. Petrenko came around the 
side of the house to greet us and lead us into the kitchen.) 
So 
this artifact occupies a prominent place 
in the public space of 
their house. 
Her mother attempted to explain to me in Russian 
with a few words of English that her cousins had made the cloth 
out of which the towel 
is made, and that she had done the 
embroidery. 
family, religion, house interiors, arts and crafts 
Mrs. Petrenko then took me into her bedroom to show me the 
icons which she and her husband had received at their wedding. 
They were placed on shelves over their respective sides of the 
bed. Other religious and family items, mostly pictures, were on 
nearby furniture. 
Each icon had draped on 
it a ritual cloth. 
She also had an 
icon that a monk at a monastery had given her 
family. 
It is a very special one to them, but she told the story 
of 
it before the tape was set up, and I do not remember it. 
But 
its significance was not in the detail; 
rather I think 
it was 
in 
the importance and meaning that the icons have for this group of 
people. 
This subject was also immediately selected by Father 
Federov. 
While he 
is a clergyman and we therefore might be 
inclined to assume that he has a special 
interest in 
icons, Mrs. 
Petrenko also selected the subject very readily. 
Icons are 
emblems of 
identity, and our view of them as expressive forms 
should be 
informed by this 
function. 
Mrs. Petrenko introduced us to a teenaged daughter before the 
interview, and to a younger daughter at the conclusion of 
it. 
During the interview, her father wandered in. 
Mrs. Petrenko's 
mother told Mary that the father has become senile.
