I LIKE TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY
Well, I likesfor to live in de country, An' I likes for to dwell on a farm. An' I likes for to
wander where de green grass grows, For de outdoor life has a charm.
I likes for to wander in de garden, Down by de ol' hay stack Where de pretty li'l chickens
go “Kick, kack, cackle” An' de pretty li'l ducks go “Quack, quack, quack.”
Quack, quack de pretty little ducks, An' a Kick, kack cackle in de mawning, De rooster
crows an' everybody knows Dat dere'll be eggs for you' breakfast in de mawning.
Sung by Mrs. Grace Lungino, Huntsville, Texas, May, 1939.
