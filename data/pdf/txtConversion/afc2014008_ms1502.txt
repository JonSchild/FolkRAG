Dear bess,
 
I was very happy to hear from you.
 i forgot to ask:
 
Naomi thought before she left for Nepal that rhododendrons
 
were po ISuf
lOUS,  ana then found that primates live where
 
nothing but rhododendrons grow.  Did she ever solve the
 
mystery 01 whether primates eat rhododendrons, or, ii not,
 
what they do eat?
 
I think you
 right that I should concentrate on
 
the role of the guitar here 101  a folklore paper.  My attempted
 
research in music is terribly frustrating.
 If obody at the
 
Institut National des Arts seems to know anything except one
 
renchman wao is researching a particular aspect 01  Senoufo
 
music.
 The Ministere d'InformatiOr
) has a well-stocked
 
phonotheqUe and has let me copy some of its tapes, but nouody
 
thei e can give me any jnformat of
l.  A lot of Ivorian and other
 
African music is played On  the radio, but they hardly ever
 
announce what it is.
 The musicians themselves,  those I have
 
managed to speak to, tell me nothing, not because they me
 
secretive or hostile,  out because they don't see what I 4
144
 
find interesting auout their music.  Anyway, few o  them
 
speak Crench t and my Dioula is even mor  
,limited that their
 
.rench.  My only hope is that I am accomplishing something
 
simply by collecting this stuff.  Nobody else seems to be
 
doing anything with it.
 Even h the irenchman was not aware
 
that it existed.  I seem to be the only researcher livin
 in
 
an African quarter.
 
bUt 1 think I can make an interesting paper by showing
 
the two completely unconnected things efiected by the guitar
 
in Africa: its use in traditio al music as a substitute for
 
the balofon, with absolutely no efiect, as far as I can see
 
on the music; and its use in High Life and other pop music,
 
where it came along with other instruments _
_
;
n(i with the
 
music associated with them.
 IL shows how some elements of
 
culture can be imported and blend with traditional èe - elements,
 
while others are c
jletely subjugated to the  raditional
 
culture.
 
I agree with you that the U.S. situation is so diiferent
 
that there is no comparison.  But do you have melodies
 
played wit
 just the thumb and jna
.ex finger'

I plan to return to Canada at the beginning of August.
 
If I stay longer than a year i run into difficulties with
 
immigration, as I am still a British citizen.  Harry and I
 
may come to California at the ena of August or early September;
 
v
ie want to settle an escrow problem on the  plot we still have
 
in Topanga.
 I could stay a couple oi weeks and work tth you.
 
but if this doesn't fit in with s our plans, do say so.
 
Anyway, I
'll write or phone as soon as I get back.
 (But I
'a
 
still like to hear from you before then.)  Perhaps you might
 
fit in a visit to us with your trip to Chicago.
 It is only
 
an hour by air, and the country will be beautiful after the
 
hassle of meetings.
 
Oh, yeaw 0 yes, there was also a Hausa group  laying one-
String gourd fidd
 
fiddles, held against the left ribs, stopped with the thumb
 
and bowed with a short bow with what seemed to b
. a leather
 
bowstring.
 The Rhythm was inverted hafl—calabashes beaten
 
with sticks and lifted and thumped down again with the toes,
 
the player sitting  n the ground with the calabash
 
between his feet.
 
But they didn't speak French, so I haven't the faintest
 
idea what it was all about, except that the Moslem rel gion
 
came int  it.
 
Harry is in Ethiopia, where he ha.. bought a lot o
 
stuff, includ:ng twelf—th—century crosses.
 
I feel excited and  rustrated at the same time  and
 
would love to get back and talk to people.
 So please
