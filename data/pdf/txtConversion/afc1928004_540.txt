Life's winter now is on my heart, 
And all to me seems dark and cold, 
Since we must sadly drift apart, 
To wakJ, to wake from that sweet dream of old. 
Now bitter are the years to me. 
That bring no calm or sweet repose; 
But while I 
roam life's restless sea, 
No time can st..al affection's rose 
CHORUS. 
The world to me is dark and cold, 
With but one dream as on I 
go, 
Yet in life's, winter dreary fold 
That rose, that rose will blossom in the summer. 
The spell you cast about my way, 
Will ever with me surely last , 
But hope once bright now must decay, 
And all, yes, all that on love's shrine we east, 
Tho' I 
may roam from you afar, 
_ ' Mid summer flower's or winter's snows, 
Thy name shall be my guiding star, 
No time can steal affection's rose. 
Chorus. 
No day so bright but has its night, 
'1 be night is near, the day must go; 
The birds of song may lake their flight, 
That rose still blossom. in the snow. 
The buds of friendship may be dead, 
Yet sadly will its tendrills close,; 
While other joys I 
prized, have fled, 
No time can steal affection's rose.

My name is O'Brien from Harlem, 
An Irishman as you can see, 
I 
can sing like a 
thrush or a 
starling, 
Or the little bird up in a 
tree. 
But the gang that stands there on the corner 
Are trying the steps and the dance, 
And they shout out whenever I'm passing. 
There's O'brien with his high water pants, 
CHORUS. 
They tell me to go over to England, 
And pay a 
short visit to France, 
And there to bring out, my new fashions, 
And call them the high water pants, 
Last week I 
went to the theatre, 
Along with my first cousin Dan, 
We hired a 
seat down in the parquette, 
Behind the big man in the band. 
When a 
nager came out with a 
banjo. 
He played up a 
highland clog dance, 
And he gave out a 
gag and con-nun-drum, 
'Bout O'Brien with his high-water pants. 
Oho. 
One night I 
strolled down the Bowery, 
Along with a 
friend Paddy Brock, 
We tho t 
we'd just drop into Geoghan's. 
to try some of his rye and rock. 
When Lire gang all cried, there's Dan O'Leary, 
The bar-tender shot me a 
glance, 
Howld your tongues," then said he to the loafers. 
That's O'Brien with his high•water pants.

Last winter was a 
hard one, Mrs. Reily did you say, 
Well, ' tis myself that knows it, for it's loan V's the day, 
Your husband wasn't the only man sat behind the wall, 
There's my old man McGuiness didn t 
get no job at. all. 
The politicians promised him work on the Uoulevard, 
To handle a 
pick and shovel sod throw dirt on the cart. 
Ah! six months ago they promised him work he'd shortly get 
But believe me, my good woman, they are promising hint yet. 
CHORUS 
Then cheer up, Mrs. Reily and dtn't give way to the blues, 
You and I 
will cut a 
shine, with new bonnets and new bhoes; 
As for me I'm done crying, no more will I 
sigh or sob, 
I'll wait till times get better, when McGuinness gets a 
job. 
The It—lians, divil take them, why didn't they stay at home, 
Shure we had plenty of our own class to ate up all our own; 
They come out, like bees in summer time and sworn for to stay; 
The contractors they have hundreds for forty cents a 
day, 
They work upon the railroad, they shovel snow and slush. 
But there's one thing in their favor, Italians they 
never do get lush, 
No, they always bring their money home, taste no gill or wine, 
And that one thing I'd like to say of your old man and mine. 
Chorus. 
Alt! the spring time now is coming we'll all have plenty work, 
McGuiness will go back to his trade, shure he's a 
handsome clerk. 
*You Eoould see him clindothe ladder as nimble as a 
fox, 
Faith he's the boy can handle the ould three cornered box. 
The boss is always bawling, hi! there, don't you stop, 
Beep your eyes turned upward, don't let no mortar drop, 
Ah ! the old man he is alwa‘s careful, nothing, he lets fall, 
The divil a 
word you'd hear hiu say to my old iii. ii at all.

The winter has come on, the summer's past and gone, 
The streets and squares are covered with ice and snow, 
The people am wearing heavy woolen clothes, 
To keep themselves %' arm us the walk to and fro. 
It )s 
easy for the rich that can afford it. 
To keep a 
warm carpet on their floor, 
In a 
soft, cushioned chair by a 
bright fire they sit, 
And never once think of the penniless and po‘r. 
CHORUS. 
So every wealthy man, give charity when you can, 
And never turn a 
poor beggar from your door. 
But give him a 
piece of b;ead, arid a 
place to lay his head, 
A 
blessing tou'll receive from the penniless and poor. 
There's the poor working- man who works hard all the day, 
And supports his family bv the sweat of his brow, 
lie tries to save a 
few shilline-s front his pay, 
To 
lay in " coal and flour if his means will allow 
Bright and early each morn to his work he does go, 
Toils with a 
will to keep the wolf from the door 
Stout-hearted he trudges along thro' the rain and sn;w, 
For he knows what it is to be penniless and poor, 
Chorus. 
And there's a 
poor widow who lives in a 
garret, 
Who goes ont poor thing to wash and scrub all the week, 
With her small basket she visits the market. 
o 
buy food cheap for the little ones she boy's. 
She toils early and late to make up the month's rent, 
So the landlord will not turn her out of the door, 
For that is what he'd do if she owed him one cent 
No feeling has he for the penniless and jar ; r.

The trysting place where you and I 
Have passed such happy hours.

Deep sadness fills my aching heart, 
And tears unbidden flow, 
For on this day my infant died, 
This day one year ago. 
A tender bud so beautiful, 
So fragile, pure and fair, 
Its fragrance far too sweet to waste 
On earth's sin- tainted air. 
Through many sad long hours of pain, 
My precious darling lay; 
Then God in sweJt compassion took, 
My little one away. 
As cold and figid in my arms, 
His lifeless form was placed, 
Such agony of soul then felt, 
Can never be effaced.

Baby died one year ago, to-day, 
Baby died one year ago, to-day, 
Baby died, baby died, 
Baby died one year ago, to-day. 
In meek submission how I 
bowed, 
To God's all- wise decree, 
He only took unto Himself 
The one He gave to me. 
And yet I 
never see a 
babe, 
But sca'ding tears will start, 
And longlif I 
crave to clasp 
My lost one to my heart. 
if I 
my fature home could choose, 
In realms where glory reigns, 
l'd ask to dwell with angel babes, 
Ever singing heavenly strains; 
For sadness fills my aching heart,

Peron this day my h9hy died,

For starved and oppressed. they're stricken with awe, 
They're driven from Ireland, and Erin ge Bragh.

Then farewell.to Ireland. the place I

Farewell to Erin, the fairest of earth,

They're singing for freedom which to them belong. 
And the heroes of Irehted whose name I 
will mention, 
Whose fame in Irish hisery is merited very strong, 
There was Daniel O'CoNnell a

And brave Robert Emmett. we're always been told,

How are yous one and all, 
Sure we thot' we'd make a 
call, 
And tell you all about the widow's party, 
at Paythogoras Hall, _ 
We gave a 
break-down ball, 
And invited all the young fdlis gay and hearty. 
There was handsome Paddy Grace, 
Sure he's now on the police, 
He was put there by a 
p'1-i-tic-al party. 
He came from County Cork, 
To the City of New York, 
He joked and sang and made us all feel hearty, 
CHORUS. 
Ah! the charming Widow Clancy, 
She was any man's fancy, 
She was a 
fluent talker, and a 
rattling six-day walke.; 
And a 
Venus is the charming Widow Clancy. 
McGinn sang Pin- a- fore, 
Till his throat was very sore, 
And " Little Dudeen," sang by Smith so sweetly, 
Crosby sang a 
little ditty, 
The girls all called him witty, 
And McOuffin done an Irish jig so neatly. 
Fl )nn sang, " Dancing on the green," 
Also " She's a 
fairy queen." 
Flt-od sang " Hold the fort for we're the 
strongest party,' 
And Murphy and Tim Lang, 
Done the Lack-a-wan-na Gang, 
Down at the charming Widow Clancy's party. Oho. 
As it was growing late, 
Sure we tho't was time to ate, 
We went in two by two's down to the supper, 
We were hardly seated right, 
When there was a 
fearful fight, 
For McGuieness swore the whiskey was all water, 
All around 'twas hand to hand, 
And they nearly killed the band, 
When in stepped the famous boxer Mike MoOartby, 
He swore by the powers above, 
That he'd just put on the gloves, 
And clear out every sucker in the party.

I 
met some time ago. 
And with this darling little girl, 
My heart did quickly go. 
I

It was so trim and neat, 
For then I 
called her all the while, 
My captivating, sweet ; Evaline, fairy queen. 
CHORUS. 
She's my captivating sweet, 
No damsel with her can compete, 
Oh ! she's the only girl I 
love,

So captivating sweet. 
I 
meet this darling every eve, 
Beneath the greenwood tree, 
And if I'd tell, you'd not believe, 
How sweet. she is to roe. 
I 
never loved in all my life, 
And kind friends I 
entreat, 
I

My captivating sweet ; Evaline, fairy queen. Oho. 
I 
went with her the other night, 
Down to her home to dine, 
And while the stars were shining bright, 
She promised to be mine; 
'Twas then to her I

"Forever now we greet," 
And soon kind friends I

Sure it's there I 
was born on a 
bright. summer's morn, 
And with joy my relations did smile. 
My father and mother, my sister and brother, 
Were pleased, to- be-sure, all the while. 
They shed tears of joy, for their bright Irish boy, 
That was born on fair Erin's green isle, 
You may talk about France, or England or Spain, 
Of their beautiful maids and greut men ; 
lint the whole world does know that fair Erin can show, 
Nobler sons, truer daughters, than them. 
Such names as O'Connell and Moore I 
will mention, 
And brave Duke of Wellington, while 
King Brian Boroglitie, and our bold Emmett too, 
Saw the light on fair Erin's Green Isle, 
There's the Killarney lakes on Erin's Green Isle, 
They're so lovely enchanting and fine. 
Sure the valley's and mountain's are eecoed to none. 
For their beauty is really sublime. 
There grows in profusion the dear little shamrock, 
Encouraged by Nature's sweet smile, 
Dear laud of-my birth, garden spot of the earth, 
You're my idol fair Erin's Green Isle,

We've heard martial songs and songs of the sea, 
Comic songs, and love songs, but they don't suit me, 
We love to sing of Ireland sweet land of our birth, 
I'm Paddy her son, and she's my mother earth. 
Oh! Erin, my country. it grieves us to see, 
Our enemies prosper, and yet we're not free, 
We fight for other countries as through life we roam, 
When half of our fighting would free our old home. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah for the son's of Erin's Isle, 
Hurrah for the daughters who on us do smile, 
A 
fig for her foes wherever they may be, 
Three cheers for old Ireland and sweet liberty. 
Arise eons of Erin, sad prove to the world 
The sunburst of freedom is once more unfurled, 
United all like brothers we'll join hand in baud, 
We'll drive the proud Saxon away from our land. 
The land is the people's and who dare dispute, 
The word of our Maker, for He spoke the truth, 
Then descend from the hill and arise from the glen, 
And once more the battle of freedom begin.

Give me back my dear old home that I 
used to love so well, 
In the dear old sunny south so far away, 
Where the breeze is softly sighing thro' the trees every night, 
And the mocking- bird sings sweet the livelong day. 
Take me back, oh! take me back to that old familiar spot, 
And Biro' the cotton fields, oh! let me roam; 
For, I'm old and feeble, and before I 
leave this land, 
Let me see once more my dear old Southern home. 
CHORUS. 
Take me back, take me back, 
Take me back to my dear old southern home! 
Take me hick, take me back, 
Take me back to my dear old southern home. 
They were happy, happy times, at the old plantation home, 
When at nir,Itt we would play the old banjo; 
I 
was a 
picaninny and my heart is light and gay, 
But the days tho' short they seem, are long ago. 
I've traveled the wide world o'er and in distant lands 
have roamed. 
But the dear old sunny south I 
love the best, 
Take me back and leave me there in my dear old 
southern home, 
In the dear sweet sunny south lay me to rest. 
Churns. 
We may never meet again for my time is drawing near, 
When III have to leave this world tor evermore ; 
So then take me back to die in the dear old sunny south, 
Where my wife and children have been laid before. 
Old ina=sa and old 
they w 
re always kind to ma, 
But they've both gone to the better land I 
know, 
13T6w_rw^“, were, no grief, nor pain, comes to cloud 
their aged brow, 
To that bright and happy land 
long to go.

Where the softest breezes rustle, 
Through the fields of nodding rye, 
And the brightest sunbeams glimmer, 
In the azure- tinted sky ; 
Dwells a 
maiden pure and lovely, 
As she gleans the golden grain ; 
One as blooming as the roses, 
Bright and winsome Winnie Wane. 
CHORUS. 
At the bright dawn of the morning, 
Or when t 
wilight shades the plain, 
You may see our queen of roses, 
Bright and winsome Winnia Wane. 
Hearts were made for joy and sorrow, 
For life's sunshine and its gloom, 
And sweet Winnie in her gladness 
Rivals all that's bright in blown. 
She is kind to those that suffer, 
And they never ask in vain, 
For the words of love and pity, 
From the lips of Wiunie Wane. 
Would you know our fondest treasury, 
Who is fairest of the fair, 
Go ainon0; the poor and lowly, 
You will ever find her there. 
Touching brightly brows of sorrow, 
Soothing hearts that throb with pain, 
While the sunbeams fall in beauty, 
O'er our wirsome, Winnie Wane.

Ve're both growing Aged together, 
And Jennie has left the old farm ; 
'To walk by the side of another, 
As on in life's journey they roam, 
And John who was tender and loving, 
Has gone in the pathvilly to harm; 
And left his old parents in sorrow, 
To suffer or mortgage the iarta, 
; 
It's sad to be aged and feeble, 
And know that this life has no charms, 
But when in old age we are childless, 
How painful to mortgage the farm, 
But when in old age we are childless, 
How painful to mortgage the farm.

We thought John would be our protection, 
For he was so kind when a 
boy; 
And Betsey so gentle and loving, 
Would call him a mother's fond joy. 
But he was led off by companions, 
In ways that bring evil and harm; 
And left his old parents in sorrow, 
To suffer or mortgage the farm. 
It's hard to be kveless and childless, 
When wrinkles are deep on the brow; 
And hair has grown aged and whitened, 
With footsteps so tottering now. 
But when we are feeble and lielplese, 
With none to protect us from harm; 
We only ean snffer in silence. 
Or tearfully mortgage the farm.

Once upon a 
time there lived a 
maiden, 
in a 
little cottage by the sea ; 
Twining round about it heavy laden, 
Grew a 
honey-suckle fair to ree; 
And the maiden watched the blossoms daily, 
heard the bees about it as it grew, 
Bent above it singing ever gaily, 
Every bud and every blossom knew, 
When the wind a 
leaf blew down, 
Caine a 
sudden dainty frown; 
Jealems was the maid I 
trow. 
Greater love she did not know, 
Igo! greater love she did nut know, 
Know, know, know, know. 
To the maiden came one day a 
lover, 
Tall and brave, and full of manly gruel 
Whispering tender words he bent above her, 
Stooped and kissed her sunny smiling face. 
Underneath the honey- suckle walked they, 
But her eese were cast demurely down; 
Seeing not as softly, sweetly talked they, 
how its leaves were turning sere and brows 
Withered now is tendrils twine, 
Bird and bee have left the vine. 
Careless is the maid I 
trow. 
Greater love lath learned to know, 
No! greater love liath learned to know, 
Know, know, know, know.

Joys of my childhood are now gone forever, 
Bright hours of the past I 
snail never more See, 
Flowers of the wildwood and home by the river, 
Yes gone are the joys that were once dear to me. 
Rocks that I 
loved in the days of my childhood, 
And brooklets by whose peaceful waters I'd play, 
While watching the sunbeams which brightened the wildwoed, 
Live ouly in memories chambers to- day.

Joys of my childhood are now gone forever, 
Bright hours of the past I

Flowers in the wild wood and home by the nY^r, 
Yes, gone are the joys that were once dear to ma. 
Hours of my childhood come back in my dreaming, 
Once more in my fancy I 
see vale and hill, 
That flowing atreandet whose waters were gleaming, 
While leaping o'er cascades to run the old mill. 
Forest o: oaks where the sweet birds were singing, 
And roses abloom ' neath the fair summer sky, 
In dreams of the past sweet remembrance is bringing, 
Of days I 
once cherished forever gone by.

Sweetly in the twilight dancing, 
Fairy-like with form entrancing, 
Cunning elf with mischief glancing, 
Little roguish eyes ; 
O'er the dew with lightness creeping, 
While the glow-worm soft is sleeping, 
And the bright stare forth are peeping, 
Peeping with surprise. • 
As she wanders through the dell, 
l 
tr.hed is every birdie's song, 
For each songster knows full well, 
She rules the warbling throng. 
Brighter seems the day declining, 
As with sunlight still combining, 
Where her gleam o'er all is shining, 
Little roguish eyes. 
(W M:44 
Blithely in the eariy morning, 
Summer day i. gently dawning, 
Lifting night's be-darkened awning, 
Little roguish eyes ; 
As she wades the brooklet flowing, 
Moves amid the violets growing, 
Not a thought on one bes t
owi ng, 
Which around her lies. 
May her future life be pure, 
May her sweetness never fade, 
May grim sorrow ne'er secure, 
My own dear mountain maid. 
Joy o'er all ray darling flinging, 
Hear the lark her praises singing, 
For to all sweet mirth she's bringing. 
Little roguish e3es.

You may think that I 
am mad, 
But I 
only feel so sad, 
The reason I 
will tell you every one; 
I 
courted a 
nice young girl, 
Whose name was Peggy Doyle, 
And I 
brought her to Coney Isle to have some fins. 
She is from the County Down, 
And she weighed two hundred pound, 
And I 
thought that she'd be true to me all the while. 
But if I 
had to do it again, 
She would never go to swim 
Along with me down to Coney Isle. 
CHORUS. 
She had salt water sure, galore, 
And she swallowed a 
quart or more, 
And the gang upon the beach began to smile. 
They all did wave their hats, 
And shouted " float her pat," 
The day 1 
brought my Peg to Coney Isle. 
Now its when we reached the pier, 
We went and had some beer, 
And after that we went and had a 
bathe, 
You may talk about your fat woman 
That traveled with Barnum's show, 
But you ought to see my Peg upon the waved, 
The gang commenced to guy us, 
lily bosom was on fire. 
When the gang gave to me a 
grand hurray, 
W hen a 
lad with a 
crooked mouth, 
•
4 
Behoove us" shouted out,  
(Chortle. 
There's one of the sea lions that escaped the other day, 
Of course I 
did feel mad, after listening to that lad, , 
Of course he thought that he was awful smart, 
But if I 
had him in New York 
Up near the Central Park, 
You can bet your life tha“ would break his heart, 
I 
don't say I'm a 
fight4 a 
cutter or a 
biter, 
But I 
can taka my own part all the while. 
Arrah-muslia bad luck to Peg, she will stand 
upon her head, 
Beiara I 
bring her again to Coney Isle.
