Informant/Event: Tour of Pueblo 
Coworker: 
Site: 6 
I arrived in Pueblo yesterday, and this morning I decided to 
take 
a tour 
of 
the 
city 
to 
familiarize 
myself 
with 
the 
neighborhoods John and I had seen when we were here in March. 
After stopping in at the Chamber of Commerce to pick up city maps 
for our fieldworkers, I took a rambling drive through the city and 
then headed out to the Mesa (as St. 
Charles Mesa is known) 
and 
drove through Blende, Vineland, 
and Avondale. 
On the Mesa, 
I 
noticed Italian surnames on mailboxes and on business signs. 
Business signs included those for DeLucca's Grocery 
and Tucchi's 
Garage in Blende, and Dionisio's turf and Pisciotta's cattle and 
vegetables in Vineland. 
I also passed a farmstand in Vineland with 
the name Thomas which caused me to recalled that Bessie Ingo had 
told me that members of the DiTomaso family had changed their name 
to Thomas (perhaps this was one of these families). 
When I returned to Pueblo, I drove along Northern Avenue and 
located the Bessemer neighborhood Kerry Kramer had shown us in 
March. 
I spotted Gus's Tavern and LaTronicas's Restaurant in this 
area. 
While driving around today I considered the major themes to 
0be investigated while we're 
Pueblo. 
These themes appear to be: 
V truck gardening o  
the Mesa;(O he St. Joseph's table tradition; the 
conection betwee n( 
a cans and 
plant; the Columbus 
Day celebration; an 
family businesses. 
I'll discuss this with 
John and Doug when t ey arrive-tomorrow.

Informant/Event: St.Joseph's Church Service 
Coworker: Williams, John; Tavarelli, Paola; Manini, Paula 
Site: 6 
At 11 a.m. this morning, John Williams, Paola Tavarelli, Paula 
Manini and I drove out to the Mesa to attend at church service at 
St.Joseph's Church, located at 1145 South Aspen Road in Blende. 
We wanted to attend a service at this Catholic church because it 
has a large number of 
Italian-Americans 
in 
its congregation. 
Specifically, we wanted to see if there were references to this in 
the service, 
the church calendar, 
on 
in some aspects of the 
church's design (stained glass windows, etc.). 
In any event, we arrived a few minutes before the start of the 
service and took seats together near the back of the church. 
People trickled in and the service began at a little past 11. 
For 
the most part, members of the congregation were dressed quite 
casually. 
Women wore skirts, pants, and dresses. 
Men wore pants 
with polo shirts or dress shirts open at the neck. 
I spotted one 
fellow in this 20s who wore shorts. 
I would guess there were about 
150 
people 
present. 
Judging 
from 
physical 
characteristics, 
Italians and Hispanics made up the majority of the congregation; 
there seemed to be equal numbers of each. 
Apart from a statue of St. Joseph at the back of the church, 
there were no visible indicators of Italian culture, and even the 
statue is not overtly Italian. 
And the service itself was totally 
bereft of any connections. 
The church program (calendar) indicated 
that none of the clergy is Italian-American or Hispanic. The mass 
schedule in the calendar noted masses to be dedicated to persons 
with both Italian (Tucci, Caricato) and Hispanic (Montoya, Sanchez, 
Gonzales) surnames. 
The today's service was quite standard in every respect, it 
seemed to me, 
and John, Paola, and Paula all concurred on this 
point. 
The service concluded at a few minutes before 12 and we 
departed. 
John took us on a short tour of the Hispanic area known as 
Salt Flats, located in the area between the Mesa and the CF & I 
plant. 
John explained that this area was originally settled by 
squatters who built dwellings on land owned by CF & I. 
We noted 
that 
a number 
of 
the 
older homes 
appeared 
to 
be 
of 
adobe 
construction. 
The steel mill is clearly visible from most spots 
in this area. 
From here we drove on to Gus' Tavern on Elm Street 
were we hoped to meet Russell and have lunch. 
This is described 
in IAW-DT-F02490.b.

Informant/Event: Lunch at Gus's Tavern 
Coworker : Williams , John ; Tavarelli , Paola; Manini, Paula 
Site: 6 
At about noon today , following our attendance at a service at 
St.Joseph 's Church, John, Paola, Paula , and I went to Gus's Tavern 
on Elm Street in Pueblo . Russell visited this old neighborhood bar 
yesterday in order to make contact with steel workers and had been 
impressed by the place and its customers. 
He had gone back there 
this morning to talk with the owner about the possibility of an 
interview . We decided to stop in and see if he (Russell) was still 
around. 
Russell 's car was out front when we drove up and he happened 
to be coming out as we approached the place . He said he'd been 
inside since 10 a.m . and was now going to his car to fetch his 
camera. 
He went back inside with us and we ordered up a round of 
drinks and a "dutch lunch," the specialty of the house and the only 
food served , I believe. 
I was very impressed by the homey feel and decor of the place. 
The bar runs along one wall and high-backed booths run along the 
opposite wall. 
A number of tables and chairs fill the area in 
between. 
The place has very high ceilings , and the walls are 
filled with all sorts of artifacts pertinent to the bar, including 
photos of the bar's founder , waitresses , the owner's dogs. 
There 
is much more , but I did not take notes and I cannot recall it all. 
(No doubt Russell will make an inventory and Ken will photograph 
the place extensively.) 
within a very few minutes our drinks and food arrived. 
John 
and I had beer in large , heavy schooner glasses, Paola and Paula 
had cokes , and Russell had a beer in a normal-size bar glass. 
The 
dutch lunch arrived and this turned out to be the makings of meat 
and cheese sandwiches : 
slices of bread, provolone cheese, ham, 
salami, tomatoes , and onion, accompanied by a dish of hot peppers. 
As we consumed our lunch, Russell told us about contacts he 
has been making . Apparently, he has been warmly received by the 
owner and his customers and this is evidenced by the fact that they 
have been buying him drinks. 
Since Paola and Paula had an interview scheduled for 2 p.m., 
we decided to leave the bar at about 1:00 . 
However, before we 
could depart , our waitress came over and told us that Freddy, the 
owner, wanted to buy us a round of drinks . With the exception of 
Russell (who has already had several beers and at least one shot 
of whiskey ), we all ordered fernet, an Italian liqueur that is the 
D•ScR 
••vy 
IAW-DT-F062490.B - 
2 
favored drink of the owner's 94-year-old father , Uncle Mike. 
The 
waitress also informed us that Freddy was "starting a tab for us" 
which meant, Russell figured , that he had bought us lunch. 
On the 
way out , Russell struck up a conversation with three men in their 
60s at the bar whom he had met earlier . I came over and introduced 
myself and 
asked how they had been treating Russell. 
They 
responded in a very cordial manner and we chatted for a few 
minutes. 
They names were Dominic , Lou, and Dominic (I didn 't catch 
the last names ). 
The two Dominics are Italian but Lou is not. 
I 
introduced them to John , Paola , and Paula . Finally, we left at 
about 1:10 and returned to the hotel.

Informant/Event: Interview with Charlie Musso 
Coworker: Williams, John 
Site: 6 
These notes concern an interview with Charlie Musso of 918 
Morrison Avenue, 
Pueblo, 
Colorado, 
by 
David Taylor 
and John 
Williams. 
A number of people have informed us that Charlie Musso is the 
key person to talk with about Pueblo's Columbus na_y activities. 
I believe Kerry Kramer 
(a resident of Pueblo who has provided 
advice to the project) was the first to recommend him. 
I also 
talked with Bessie Ingo of Blende, who is Musso's sister. 
John 
is 
particularly 
interested 
in 
the 
Columbus 
Day 
phenomenon, and has conducted some research into the observance 
here in Pueblo. 
His perusal of materials on the subject at the 
Pueblo Public Library helped shape this interview and allowed us 
to 
glean material 
that we probably would 
not 
have 
acquired 
otherwise. 
At any rate, I first called Musso last Saturday and broached 
the subject of an interview. 
He seemed very happy to be asked and 
we agreed to get together at his house at 3 p.m. this afternoon. 
John and I arrived precisely at 3 and rang the bell at the 
front door. 
Musso, a stout man in his late seventies, greeted us 
at the door. 
We had our bags of recording equipment and I 
explained that we wanted to tape an interview. 
He said this would 
be fine and asked what location would be appropriate. 
We were 
standing in a large and ornately decorated living room at this 
moment, but the kitchen was adjacent, with a small table and chair 
and this appeared to be the best location. 
I said the kitchen 
would be fine and he ushered us in. 
As I set up the tape recorder 
and other gear, John made small talk with Charlie. 
Among other 
things, they talked about some of the many organizations Charlie 
belongs 
to, 
including 
the 
T.P.A. 
or 
Travellers' 
Protective 
Association. 
After five or ten minutes, I had the equipment set 
up and we began the interview. 
For the record, Charlie sat at one 
end of the table and I sat at the other, with John in between. 
We 
were all quite close together; I'd say Charlie was no more than 
three feet away from me. 
I set up a single Sennheiser microphone 
with cardioid tip on a boom positioned above Charlie's head. 
I ran 
the Nagra tape recorder (in the MONO setting) and monitored the 
tape from time to time. 
I should note that ambient noise resulted 
from ceiling fans in the living room and a sticking doorbell that 
ran throughout the interview (Charlie attempted to unstick the 
doorbell, but it defied his efforts.) 
IAW-DT-F062590.A - 
2 
While Charlie's wife could be heard attending to chores and 
answering the phone in another part of the house, but she never 
emerged and, 
consequently, 
we did not meet her. 
During the 
interview, Charlie mentioned that they have been married for 55 
years. 
The 
interview 
began 
with 
a review 
of 
Charlie's 
family 
background and occupational history. 
Born in 1912, he grew up on 
the Mesa on his family's farm and, in addition to farming, took an 
active part in marketing the family's produce to grocers in Pueblo. 
As Charlie reflected on more than one occasion, he has been a 
salesman all his life. 
Later on, in 1935 I believe, Charlie got 
a job at CF & I. 
He explained that he was able to secure the job 
because of his political connections in the Republican party. 
He 
could not recall instances of Italian labor recruitment or any 
particular cohesion of Italians in the plant. 
After leaving the 
plant in 1942 
(I think), he went into other ventures, including 
running 
several 
bars, 
working 
as 
a liquor 
salesman, 
selling 
gravestones, and running a car wash. 
The majority of the interview focused on Charlie's involvement 
with the Columbus Day celebration in Pueblo. 
A sub-theme to this 
was his membership in the Columbus Lodge and the relationship of 
this lodge to the other lodges in Pueblo. 
Towards the end of the interview, I pulled out my camera and 
took a few black and white shots of John and Charlie as they 
talked. 
During the interview, I noticed that Charlie employed the old-
timer's pronunciation of Pueblo. 
Instead of rendering it as Puh-
WEB-lo, as I would pronounce it, he says Pee-EBB-lo. 
We concluded the interview at about 4:45. 
Altogether we 
recorded three reel-to-reel tapes. 
Before we departed, we chatted 
with Charlie for 5-10 minutes on his front porch. 
There are a 
couple of signs with Charlie's name on them on his porch and these 
might make a nice background for a portrait of Charlie by Ken.

Informant/Event: John Pagano (Pass Key Restaurant) 
Coworker : Williams, John 
Site: 6 
This morning at 9:00 John Williams and I drove to 518 E. 
Abriendo Avenue in Pueblo to interview John Pagano about the 
restaurant that he and his brother Frank Pagano have run since 
1952 . (Pagano and I had agreed to meet today after I spoke with 
him at the restaurant yesterday . The first time I met him was on 
June 20 when Doug DeNatale and I had lunch at the branch of 
restaurant that's located on Route 50 East.) 
There are a number of reasons why we wished to interview John 
Pagano about the restaurant . One reason is that it is a 
 well-known 
local restaurant run by an Italian-Amerman family. Another reason 
is that the food served in the restaurant is a synthesis of Italian 
cuisine and standard American cuisine . And the third key reason 
is that the restaurant is 
clearly considered to be a Pueblo 
tradition by local residents . The third point is made explicit in 
a 4-page newspaper-like handout that' s available at the restaurant. 
One of the "stories" in the handout is titled "Pass Key's . . . A 
 
Pueblo Tradition " and begins : "Playing softball at St auter fi e ld , 
fishing at Runyon Lake, "one on one" at the "slab, " going to the 
"Bell 
Game ," 
and 
eating a Pass 
Key 
Special 
are 
all 
Pueblo 
traditions ." 
Later on in the story , the writer notes: 
"In four 
generations , many Peubloans have left the city, 
but when they 
return, one of the things they must do before they leave is to stop 
and have a "special " and a bottle of Pepsi. 
School reunions are 
often planned and attended at the restaurant as part of the 
festivities . A former Puebloan ordered fifty Pass Key's and had 
them shipped frozen to Alaska while he was in the service. 
During 
the Vietnam War, Pass Keys were sent to soldiers stationed all over 
the world 
including the war 
zone . 
Families 
visiting their 
relatives will stop at the restaurant first and then call their 
family - 'We just into town . We're at Pass Key's eating , we'll be 
by in a while."' 
'S?reQAL 
Since this handout contained much 
information 
about the •i 
restaurant -- its founding , its menu , and its significance to the t4-4Nb OUT 
community -- it served as a very useful guide to topics to be pursued 
in the interview. 
By the way , the reason the restaurant is called Pass Key's (my 
first question about the place when Doug and I ate there) 
is 
because the original owner, 
who had the place before Sam and 
Terresa Pagano (John and Frank's uncle and aunt from whom their 
acquired the restaurant ) was an Italian named Pasquale . According 
to John, he was known as "Passkey" because most people could not T-0 PpzSKeY 
aE 1 
FCda,G 
IAW—DT—F062790.A — 
2 
pronounce Pasquale. 
Since John and I would have only an hour for the interview 
(John Pagano said he 'd talk with us before the restaurant opened 
at 10:00) , I decided to record the interview on one of the cassette 
machine instead of the Nagra because less time would be required 
to set up equipment. 
At any rate , the interview was conducted in one of the 
restaurant 's booths . I sat opposite John Pagano and operated the 
recording equipment and John Williams sat next to John Pagano. 
The 
interview was recorded in the MONO mode with a clip-on microphone 
attached to Pagano's shirt. 
The interview went well , I thought , and covered all the areas 
we had intended to cover. 
John Williams and I participated equally 
in the questioning of Pagano. 
Pagano had brouaht along his 
✓ sgraplz 
about the r•urant (containing newspaper stories, 
copies of old menus, and a few other items ) and we talked about its 
contents at the end of the interview. 
We concluded the interview at about 9:55. 
Before we left, 
Pagano mentioned that his aunt (whose name I do not recall at the 
moment) would be a good informant, and that he would be willing to 
set something up for us if we wished. 
I said I'd have to get back 
to him about this . 
I asked if we could come back to take 
photographs 
in the restaurant 
(including coverage of sausage-
making ), 
and he said that would be fine with him. 
I told him I 
would make a copy of the tape we made today, and I'll try to bring 
this 
to 
him when 
I come 
by 
to 
ask 
about 
arrangements 
for 
photography.

Informant/Event: Merlino's Restaurant 
Coworker: Williams, John 
Site: 6 
These notes concern an interview at Merlino's Restaurant in 
Canon City, Colorado, with the restaurant's proprietor, Michael, 
and his aunts, Elizabeth Merlino Varney and Carmella Merlino Sauer. 
When John Williams and I conducted fieldwork preliminary to 
the selection of the Colorado fieldsite, Canon City was one of the 
potential sites we visited. 
During that brief visit in March of 
this year, we had dinner at Merlino's Restaurant and talked with 
Michael Merlino about the history of this family-run restaurant. 
John, in particular, was fascinated by the restaurant. 
In addition 
to the obvious fact that it is a multi-qeneration, 
family-run 
enterprise, the main things that captivated him about the place 
were the contrast between family recipes and pan-Italian red sauce 
recipes on the menu, and the degree to which the local population 
(the majority being non-Italian) had supported the restaurant over 
the years. 
At any rate, even though it is outside of Pueblo, the 
site we ultimately selected for our field research, 
John was? 
sufficiently intrigued by Merlino's to schedule an appointment to 
o 
vwfl 
conduct an 
interview with Michael Merlino and his Uncle Joe 
Merlino, one of the original founders of the restaurant along with 
Michael's father. 
Last week, John, Doug DeNatale, and I had dinner 
at the restaurant and John spoke with Michael Merlino to confirm 
that he and I would return for an interview at noon today. 
After our interview with John Pagano earlier today, John and 
I returned to the hotel to pick up the Nagra and associated 
recording gear and hit the road for Canon City. 
We arrived at the 
restaurant at noon and went to the office in an adjacent building 
to ask for Michael. 
His secretary paged him and he joined us 
momentarily. 
After we exchanged the usual pleasantries, Michael 
explained that Uncle Joe would not be joining us today because his 
wife had died a few days ago. 
As an alternative, Michael had 
invited his aunt, Elizabeth Varney of Colorado Springs to join us. 
We then followed him into the restaurant through the subterranean 
kitchen and went into the central dining area. 
When we arrived, 
we met Michael's wife Kathy (Cathy?) and his aunt, who were sitting 
at a banquette in the corner of the floor. 
We introduced ourselves 
and explained the purpose of our visit and the general goals of the 
project. 
Mrs. Varney, who is in her 70s, appeared very pleased to 
meet two representatives of the Library of Congress and remarked 
that she had a book at the Library. 
When we queried her about 
this, she said she had written a novel about Italians in Colorado 
before 1940, and that she had retained a literary agent to sell her 
IAW-DT-F062790.B - 
2 
book to a publisher. 
(When she said her book is at the Library she 
meant that the manuscript had been sent in to register it in the 
Copyright Office .) 
She further explained that her book was titled 
"Dialects ," 
a title chosen as a metaphor for the diversity of 
Italian-American culture , I believe. 
At any rate , the fact that Mrs. Varney announced her literary 
endeavors at the outset served to alert us that she considered us 
kindred spirits of a sort ; that, 
like us, 
she was a cultural 
observer. 
She also said that her novel contained family stories 
she would share with us today and asked that we not publish them 
in anything we might produce . In this connection, several times 
during the interview she would enthusiastically launch into a 
stories and then, recalling her own project, announce that this or 
that story was in her book and that we wouldn 't want us to use it. 
Despite these cautions , however, she was quite a good story-teller 
and provided many finely drawn descriptions of growing up in 
Brookside (just outside of Canon City) and, later, Canon City. 
Before we began to tape record the interview , Michael asked 
we would have lunch with them. 
We said we would and ordered steaks 
and salads , as did Mrs. Varney . Michael ordered a salad. 
Kathy 
relayed the orders to a cook and stayed away from us until the 
conclusion of the interview even though I told her she was welcome 
to join us. 
Before our food arrived , I set up the recording equipment 
while John chatted with Michael and his aunt. 
I positioned a 
Sennheiser cardiod microphone on a mic stand and boom over several 
feet over the table and aimed downward in the general direction of 
Michael and his aunt, who sat in the middle of the banquette. 
John 
sat to their right and I sat to their left. 
Kathy and a member of 
the restaurant staff sat about ten feet away in booth and had lunch 
and talked softly . Upstairs , in another dining room , the local 
Rotary Club holding its weekly luncheon meeting. 
The restaurant 
was closed to all other business. 
The interview began and moved along smartly with John doing 
nearly all 
of 
the questioning. 
Mrs. 
Varney replied to his 
questions with enthusiasm and, as noted earlier, often provided 
lengthy and finely-drawn descriptions. 
Michael joined in too, but 
tended to defer to his aunt on most matters. 
After, perhaps , 45 minutes, a phone call came in for Michael. 
It was another aunt, Carmella Sauer, and apparently she was free 
to join us too. 
Within a few minutes she arrived, and sat down 
with us for the remainder of the interview . She is Mrs. Varney 
younger sister and lives in Florence . Her presence was definitely 
a plus and the discussion of family stories became more animated 
with the addition of another point of view. 
Michael talked a 
little less now, 
and appeared fascinated to hear the stories, 
especially those that related to the founding and development of 
DID l' cZS

the restaurant. 
Other topics discussed included: 
foods eaten by the Merlino 
family at home, life in Brookside where Ubaldo 
Merlino worked as 
a coal miner, the purchase of a fruit orchard outside of Canon City 
and the move from Brookside, the establishment of the restaurant 
as a roadhouse, the gradual expansion of the restaurant, contacts 
with and stories about a local 
family reputed to have Mafia 
connections, 
prejudice 
against 
Italian, 
and 
the 
restaurant's 
current menu. 
The interview finally wound down at about 2:30 and we packed 
up to leave. 
Back outside in the parking lot, we chatted with

minutes or so.

Informant/Event: Visit with Al and JoAnna Collette 
Coworker: Williams, John; Manini, Paula 
Site: 6 
At about 12:45 this afternoon, John Williams, Paula Manini and 
I went to Collette's Caterinq at 1614 Northern Avenue in Pueblo to 
talk with Al and JoAnna Collette. 
(John and I met the Collette's 
when we were in Pueblo in March; Paula conducted an interview with 
them a few days ago concerning St. Joseph's table.) 
The purpose 
of today's visit was to talk with them about their family's 4th of 
July celebration and, for John and me, to make contact with them 
again. 
When we arrived, Al, JoAnna, and their son Tim and daughters 
Stephanie and Teresa were all working in the small kitchen area of 
their shop. 
Some were making lunches for the noon walk-in trade, 
and others were preparing a large catering order for a function to 
be held this evening. 
JoAnna was making spiced meatballs for the 
catering order and I chatted with her and took several photos as 
she worked. 
Another of Al and JoAnna's sons, Tim, also came into 
the restaurant for a few minutes and then left to attend to a 
tennis game or some other non-restaurant matter. 
Within a few minutes, we were asked what we wanted for lunch 
and orders were taken. 
I continued to chat with JoAnna and, at 
the same time, John and Paula were talking with other members of 
the family as they bustled about with their chores and cracked 
jokes about each other. 
Our lunches were soon ready and Al ushered 
us into the rear kitchen and asked us to take seats around a large 
stainless steel food preparation table. 
No work was taking place 
in this area of the shop, so it was a good place for us to dine. 
As we sat down to eat, Al joined us and, not long after, so 
did JoAnna. 
We all talked easily about a variety of topics, 
including the state of our research, Stephanie's upcoming wedding 
(it will be in November--a slow time for the family's business and, 
therefore, fore convenient), Al's brief employment at CF & I and 
his hitch in the Navy as a radioman, JoAnna's parents Frank and 
Rose Nigro (whom Paula and Paola have interviewed), and the 4th of 
July. 
With regard to the 4th of July, Al and JoAnna have invited all 
of us to come to their home and join in their family celebration 
with other relatives. 
Although things will be going on at their 
home throughout the day, 
they suggested that we arrive in the 
middle of the afternoon (3:30-4:00) and stay on to eat, drink, and 
watch fireworks that they'll set off after dark. 
Covering at least 
one 
family's 
4th 
of July activities was high on my list of 
IAW-DT-F062890.A - 
2 
priorities, 
so I am pleased that we can get together with the 
Collette's. 
As we talked, I pulled out my camera and took photos of Al and 
JoAnna talking with John and Paula. 
Paula took a few shots, too. 
After about an hour and 45 minutes (not to mention a large 
lunch) we departed and went back to the hotel. 
The Collette's will 
be joining us for dinner this evening at a local Italian restaurant 
so that all members of our team can meet them prior to the 4th.

Informant/Event: Gene Mattarocci (LaTronica's Restaurant) 
Coworker: Williams, John 
Site: 6 
Two evenings ago, 
the fieldwork team (John, 
Paola, 
Paula, 
Russell and me) had dinner at La Tronica's Restaurant, located at 
1143 E. Abriendo in Pueblo, where, in addition to having a fine 
meal, we spoke with the owner and bartender, Gene (he sometimes 
goes by "Geno") Mattarocci. 
Gene joined us at our table and spoke 
with us at some length about our project and provided information 
about his family background and about the restaurant, a family-
owned enterprise and one of the oldest in the city. 
John and I 
were particularly impressed by Gene's insightful comments and we 
decided to see if we could schedule an interview with him. 
To this 
end, John phoned him yesterday and Gene agreed to be interviewed 
at the restaurant at 9 a.m. this morning. 
John and I arrived on time and entered the restaurant where 
we 
found Gene 
seated 
at 
one 
of 
the back tables 
engaged 
in 
conversation with a friend, a Mr. Oswald. 
(The restaurant is not 
open for business this early in the day; it opens at about 5 p.m., 
I believe.) 
Gene greeted us warmly and Oswald left within a couple 
of minutes. 
I set up the recording equipment while John chatted 
with Gene. 
For this interview, I used the Nagra stereo machine set in the 
Mono mode, 
with a single Sennheiser microphone 
(cardioid tip) 
mounted on a mic stand with boom. 
I sat at one end of the table, 
Gene sat at my left and John sat at my right. 
The restaurant was dark and cool, a sharp contrast to the 
bright sunshine and the high temperature ( 
it would rise to over 
100 in the afternoon) outside. 
In the kitchen and behind the bar, 
two women who have worked in the restaurant for many years busied 
themselves with chores required to prepare the restaurant for 
another day of business. 
From time to time, they created sounds 
that will be heard on the tape, sounds such as the movement of ice 
in the machine behind the bar, and the moving around of dishes and 
other objects. 
Also, two delivery men entered while the recording 
was underway and the sounds they made will also be apparent. 
On 
at least two occasions the telephone rang and, 
as Gene went to 
answer the phone, I switched off the machine for 30 seconds or so. 
Gene is a gregarious, friendly fellow and John and I took to 
him quickly. 
He was dressed informally in a liquor company T-shirt 
("Mount Royal Whisky"), jeans, and a "Coors Light" baseball-style 
cap. 
IAW-DT-F062990.A -

The interview covered a great deal of ground including life 
in Gene's family as he grew up on a farm on the Mesa, working on 
the farm, taking produce to a vegetable market in Denver, working 
in the restaurant as a young man, going to college in Denver, and 
getting a job teaching math in Pueblo public schools. 
After three 
years of teaching, Gene quit and went into business with his uncle 
at the restaurant where he has worked ever since. 
As he observed 
during the interview, perhaps there is something in his Italian 
genes that made him want to operate his own business. 
A good deal of the second half of the interview dealt with the 
establishment of LaTronica's Restaurant and its menu and clientele. 
The interview went very smoothly, I think, and it is probably 
the most enjoyable I have participated in to date. 
Gene seemed to 
enjoy the discussion, 
too, 
and remarked, 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
interview, that he had had a good time and said "you guys are good" 
(meaning that he thought we were able interviewers). 
After we had used up three reels of tape, Gene asked us if 
we'd like a beer. 
We said "sure," and he took bottles out of the 
cooler behind the bar and brought them to the table. 
He had a 
beer, too. 
Consequently, sounds of our bottles being moved around 
on top of the formica-covered table will be heard rather loudly. 
Incidentally, when we asked Gene about his children, he noted 
that his son, Frank, in addition to working in the restaurant on 
weekends, is also a rodeo cowboy and a horse-shoer (farrier). 
When I asked Gene about bringing Ken Light around to take 
photos inside the restaurant he said that it would be alright with 
him. 
We concluded the interview, packed up and left the restaurant 
at about 11:45. 
Gene's home address is: 
2238 Highway 50 East, 
Pueblo, Co 
81006. 
The address at the restaurant is:

Informant/Event: ricotta cheese-making with Joe Vasile 
Coworker: Tavarelli, Paola 
Site: 6 
This entry concerns the documentation of ricotta cheese-making 
by Joe Vasile, who has a small cheese-making facility on Daniel 
Road in Vineland, one of the three small communities on St. Charles 
Mesa outside of Pueblo. 
(Vasile's home address is: 
2829 Cheyenne, 
Pueblo, CO 
81003). 
At a little before 9 a.m. this morning, I accompanied Paola 
Tavarelli to the home of Frank Nigro on Routt Street in Pueblo. 
A few days ago, Paola and Paula Manini interviewed Frank and his 
wife Rose (who are the parents of JoAnna Collette) and, during the 
course of that interview, learned from the Nigro's that the son of 
Frank's first cousin makes ricotta cheese. 
The cheese-maker is Joe 
Vasile and he learned about making cheese from Frank when he worked 
for him on his farm in Walsenberg some years ago. 
In any event, 
Frank had volunteered to take us to meet Joe and Paola had taken 
him up on this. 
Within the last couple of days, Paola has spoken 
with Frank and Joe to confirmed the time that we should get 
together. 
For 
this 
trip, 
I'm 
going 
along 
mainly 
to 
take 
photographs as serve as an extra observer. 
Paola will be the 
primary interviewer since she has developed these contacts. 
Anyhow, we arrived at the Nigro's and picked up Frank, who is 
87 and walks rather stiffly with the aid of a cane. 
He is a warm 
and open man and was soon calling me by my first name and telling 
story after story about his life as we drove out to the Mesa. 
Among other things, he said that he had worked as a barber on the 
former army air force base in Pueblo that was located in the 
vicinity of the present airport, his birthplace in Italy, and his 
early years in the United States. 
At about 20 minutes past 9, we arrived at Vasile's cheese-
making facility in Vineland. 
We pulled off the road and parked in 
front of a small (about 40 ft. x 12 ft.) 
cinderblock building. 
Save for its street number, the building was unadorned; there was 
no sign identifying it was a cheese shop. 
As we emerged from the 
car, Joe Vasile (pronounced VA-SILLY, by the way) came to the door 
and said something like: 
"Where have you been? 
I started at 7 
o'clock." 
I interpreted this to mean that, somehow, we had been 
told to arrive at the wrong time and had missed the entire cheese 
making process. 
However, after a while I realized that what Vasile 
had meant was that we had missed the first stage of the process, 
namely the making of three cylinder-shaped hard goat cheese. 
Fortunately, we had not missed the making of the softer ricotta 
cheese. 
IAW-DT-F063090.A - 
2 
We entered the building through the front door and found 
ourselves in a small room with a counter that I took to be a sales 
counter of sorts. 
Two smaller rooms, not much bigger than closets, 
were off this room, along the back wall of the building. 
Vasile 
led us through this room and into a larger room that was the area 
where he makes cheese. 
Windows were set in the east and west 
walls, and a back room was set into the western wall. 
Along most 
of the length of the eastern wall ran a stainless steel sink and 
drainer which were 
loaded with a number 
of 
stainless 
steel 
implements including a strainer or colander of some kind. 
Along 
the north wall was another stainless steel sink and counter, and 
three perforated cylindrical containers (one of stainless steel and 
two of plastic) held cheese that Vasile that made earlier today. 
In the northwest corner of the room, just a few inches away from 
the sink and counter just noted, stood a large kettle-drum shaped 
stainless steel vessel that was mounted in a metal frame. 
The 
vessel was about three feet in diameter. 
Opposite the vessel, in 
the southwest corner of the room was a large walk-in cooler. 
I'd 
say the entire room was about 12x12. 
Joe seemed fully aware of the reason for our visit (I believe 
Paola had spoken with him at the Nigro's house a few days ago) and 
so there was no need to deliver a lengthy explanation about the 
project. 
As soon as Paola had set up her tape recorder 
(the 
portable Marantz machine) Joe said something to the effect of: 
Well, you ask the questions and I'll answer them the best I can. 
In short, he was ready to begin an explanation of the cheese-making 
process. 
Paola turned on the recorder and, after a minute or so had 
elapsed, I provided the opening announcement and then asked Joe to 
tell us his birthdate, birthplace, and a few detailed about his 
personal history. 
Having dispense with these preliminaries, we 
then got into the details of making ricotta cheese. 
Joe explained 
this rather clearly as he began to actually make the cheese. 
Basically, 
the procedure is to heat goats' 
milk in the large 
stainless steel bowl until it reaches a temperature of about 190 
degrees, add a small amount of salt (he put in about two small 
handfuls of Kosher salt from a box), then stir gently with a long 
wooden stirring device the resembled a broom handle with two wooden 
disks attached near one end. 
I should note that as the milk was 
being heated a two-piece stainless steel cover was in place over 
the top of the bowl; he pulled one half of the cover a few inches 
away from the other half in order to insert the stirring device. 
When he wasn't stirring the milk, 
Joe continued with his 
description of the process. 
Frank Nigro, who was standing a few 
feet away at one side of the room offered comments from time to 
time, including specific instructions to Joe such as "Stir it slow" 
or "Don't put in too much salt." 
Joe didn't seem to mind these 
comments. 
After all, Frank had been his teacher. 
IAW-DT-F063090.A - 
3 
As the milk was continuing to heat up, Joe took Paola and I 
outside and opened a door to a small basement area below the cheese 
house. 
He then pointed out a kind of a heating device or "boiler" 
which supplies heat for the large stainless steel bowl directly 
above it. 
I'm not clear on how this works, but my guess it that 
it provides steam heat to the area between the two layers of metal 
that make up the bowl. 
An on-off switch was mounted on the wall 
in the cheese-making room directly behind the big bowl. 
We then returned to the cheese-making room and Joe checked the 
milk. 
We could see that more small bubbles were forming of the 
surface. 
Joe explained that more bubbles had to form and solidify 
to a certain extent. 
This substance would then be skimmed off and 
drained to form the ricotta. 
Gradually, this state was achieved 
and Joe removed one half of the cover and began to remove the 
ricotta with a small stainless steel dipper (he said he had a more 
efficient tool of this stage of the operation but couldn't locate 
it). 
In this manner the ricotta was transferred from the bowl to 
a number of small perforated plastic containers (about 1-2 pint 
capacity) that Joe had set out on the drainer of the sink nearest 
to the bowl. 
The ricotta was placed in these containers in order 
to allow liquid to drain off. 
I photographed all this in color and black and white. 
Frank requested some fresh ricotta and Joe gave him a couple 
of dippers-full in a small china bowl. 
Frank broke up pieces of 
Italian bread that he had brought along and move back into the 
first room of the cheese house to eat it. 
At about this point, 
Paola followed him and began to record his comments. 
And also at 
about this time Joe's nephew, Charlie Vasile came. 
Charlie is in 
his mid-twenties and assists Joe with the cheese-making and the 
care of the goats. 
Charlie's address is 28088 Hilldare Rd., 
Pueblo, CO 
81006. 
(Later on, Paola told me that one reason she 
moved to the other room was because the temperature in the cheese-
making room was becoming unbearable. 
The milk was being heated to 
190 degrees in a small, closed room, after all.) 
I stayed with Joe and continued to photograph his activities. 
When he had finished transferring all the ricotta to the small 
containers we began to talk about Joe's experiences in the Pacific 
during World War II. 
At about this point, Paola rejoined us and 
then we returned to the subject of cheese-making. 
We then went outside to see other buildings associated with 
the cheese-making. 
First, we walked about 25 yards behind the 
cheese house to a smaller building. 
We climbed a short flight of 
stairs and entered a small equipment room that Joe called his "junk 
room." 
There we saw a number of tools and other items scattered 
around. 
Joe rummaged around for a moment and then came up with a 
small hand-made basket that had been made in Italy. 
The basket was 
IAW-DT-F063090.A - 
4 
8 inches in diameter and 4 inches deep. 
Joe explained that this 
is the type of basket Italian cheese-makers use to drain off their 
ricotta, not perforated metal or plastic containers like the ones 
he uses. 
He explained that he had used the basket for this 
purpose, but a health inspector had seen him so this and threatened 
to close down his operation if he persisted in doing this. 
I took 
a couple of photos of Joe holding the basket. 
We then left this small room and went out, opening a second 
door and descended stairs into a surprisingly deep cement cellar 
beneath the building. 
There, spread out on a 4x8 ft. 
sheet of 
plywood, were a large number of hardened rounds of goat cheese. 
Joe explained that these cheese had been treated in a brine 
solution (the solution was inside two plastic trask barrels with 
lids), then salted with dry salt (Kosher salt again) and allowed 
to cure. 
Joe then went upstairs to fetch a knife and returned to 
cut us each a small slice from one of the rounds. 
Though we were 
a little reluctant to leave the cool cellar, after a few minutes 
we climbed back to ground level and walked further back on the 
property to his goat pens. 
Before we arrived at the pens, Joe pointed our a mechanical 
device for cracking corn to be feed to the goats. 
He also showed 
us a small building which was used to store the cracked corn. 
We 
then entered the low shed that contained the apparatus for milking 
the goats, consisting on metal stocks into which the animals could 
be held while being milked as well as pneumatic milking equipment. 
From this small, rectangular room, we proceeded through a door and 
into the barn. 
A large number of curious goats observed us, some 
shyly backed away while the tamer ones rushed up to meet Joe. 
After a moment or two, more of the goats crowded up against us. 
We moved outside through a large opening and into the goat pen 
where Joe pointed out the gravity feeder. 
Walking to the far end 
of the pen, he showed up an adjacent pig pen with several smallish 
pigs that scurried about when they spotted us. 
This completed our 
tour and we walked back to the cheese house. 
We chatted with Joe, 
Frank, 
and Charlie for a few more 
minutes. 
I asked for a few of the labels Joe buts on the cheese 
containers, and he gave them to me. 
(The labels have been added 
to the project's collection.) 
Finally, at about 11:30, we thanked 
Joe for his help and departed. 
We drove Frank back to his house 
and visited with him and his wife Rose in their shady garden at the 
back of the house. 
After a couple of hours in the hot cheese room, 
I was more than happy to sit in the shade with the Nigros. 
Paola 
took a seat near Rose and I sat close to Frank. 
Paola began to 
talk to Rose and Frank began to tell me stories about his life in 
Walsenberg, where he farmed, 
including funny tales about wild 
animals that threatened his livestock. 
He also told me about the 
fruit trees and vegetables he now grows in his backyard garden. 
We started talking about wine making and Frank insists that I have 
a drink of some of his homemade wine. 
I said "OK" and a bottle was 
IAW-DT-F063090.A - 
5 
produced. 
The wine was very strong, almost a brandy, but not bad. 
Frank and Rose asked us to stay for lunch, but since Paola and I 
are a little tired and have other appointments later on, 
we 
declined. 
We left the Nigros at about 1:30.

Informant/Event: Bouchard, Father Norman 
Coworker: Manini, Paula 
Site: 6 
This morning at about 9:30 Paula Manini and I arrived at 
St.Joseph's Church in Blende for an interview Paula had set up with 
one 
of 
the 
priests, 
Father Norman 
Bouchard. 
We 
introduced 
ourselves to the church secretary. 
She phoned Fr. Bouchard, who 
was elsewhere in the building. 
Within a few minutes, Bouchard 
joined us and then escorted us upstairs to a small room, sort of 
a counseling room it seemed like to me. 
Since we were going to interview Bouchard about the St. Joseph 
Day tradition, Paula and I had previously agreed that she would 
take the lead in the interview while I operated the recording 
equipment. 
I miked Bouchard with a lavaliere mike, checked the 
recording level on the Marantz cassette recorder, and then the 
interview began. 
Bouchard ("Father Norm")is a young guy, in his mid thirties, 
and he is extremely friendly and outgoing. 
As it turns out, he 
grew up in Vermont and has been in Pueblo for only a couple of 
years. 
(The specific details will be on the recording.) 
The interview dealt principally with his knowledge of the St. 
Joseph Day devotion as observed in the Pueblo area and elsewhere. 
He has had a parish in upstate New York, and remembered that St. 
Joseph's Day was observed there too. 
Paula and I asked him to talk 
about his role in the devotion and the church's current attitude 
toward what is essentially a vernacular observance. 
Although 
Bouchard acknowledged that the 
church's 
attitude toward 
folk 
traditions may not have been particularly enlightened in the past, 
he said that today there is a good deal of openness. 
He said that 
he personally welcomes the opportunity to use St. Joseph's day 
devotions to celebrate the beauty of Christian charity. 
The interview also contained Bouchard's descriptions of St. 
Joseph's Day "tables" in the Pueblo area that he has been invited 
to bless. 
(Photographs shown to us by other informants have shown 
him at their "tables. ") 
This is an agricultural area, 
I also asked if there were 
particular blessings that were given to ensure the success of 
crops. 
Bouchard said that he is sometimes asked to come into the 
fields at the beginning of the year to bless the crops. 
As I 
recall, he said he is asked to do this mainly by parishioners of 
Italian and Mexican descent. 
IAW-DT-F070290.A -

Since Bouchard had another appointment, 
we concluded the 
interview at a little after 10 
o'clock. 
Before we left, 
he 
supplied us with photo-copies of prayers that he and other priests 
deliver on St. 
Joseph's Day, 
as well as a copy of the church 
calendar (program) from this year's St. Joseph's Day service at his 
church. 
We left the church at 10:15.

Informant/Event: Ingo, Bessie 
Coworker: Manini, Paula 
Site: 6 
After we concluded our interview with Father Norm Bouchard at 
St. Joseph's Church, Paula Manini and I drove down route 50 to the 
home of Mrs. Bessie Ingo, located at 27881 Highway 50 East. 
I had 
met Mrs. Ingo when John Williams and I visited the community back 
in March. 
At that time I had talked with her at some length about 
her involvement with St. Joseph's Day devotions. 
At that time, it 
was my feeling (later confirmed by informant JoAnna Collette) that 
Mrs. Inao is an outstanding cook and an exemplar of the tradition 
of preparing St. 
Joseph's tables. 
She knows the "rules" 
for 
pre 
s. 
Bessie grew up "on the Mesa, " as this agricultural part of 
Pueblo is called, married a farmer (the late Tony Ingo), and helped 
her husband run a small truck farming operation that produced a 
large variety of crops. 
In many ways, her experience is typical 
of Italian-American women of her generation who live in this area. 
In addition to working on the family farm, Bessie worked as 
a cook in the local school system for many years and also earned 
additional money by baking and decorating cakes for weddings, 
anniversaries, and other special occasions. 
It's also worth noting that Bessie is a sister of Charlie 
Musso, an informant whom John Williams and I interviewed. 
I'll note that Paula (whose particular assignment for the 
project is to investigate St. 
Joseph's Day traditions) 
phoned 
Bessie a few times in order to set up interviews, but each time 
Bessie demurred, saying that she wasn't feeling up to par. 
Since 
I knew that Mrs. Ingo can be a bit shy, I spoke with her the last 
time Paula phoned, and this seemed to do the trick. 
In other 
words, she remembered me, and this was reassuring to her. 
I told 
her I'd come with Paula. 
When we knocked at her front door at about 10:30, 
Bessie 
greeted us very warmly and showed us into her large kitchen. 
We 
sat down around her round wooden table and chatted awhile to break 
the ice. 
We explained that we wanted to record an interview about 
her St.Joseph Day activities, and she said that would be fine. 
I 
set up the recording equipment (stereo Marantz cassette recorder 
with lavaliere microphone) and we began the interview, with Paula 
asking most of the questions. 
After covering background information about Bessie's family 
IAW-DT-F070290.B - 
2 
background, 
date of birth, 
marriage, 
etc., 
we asked her many 
questions about St. Joseph's day, especially her motivations for 
sponsoring tables, and the  structure of the ritual, including the 
symbolic meaning of food, the selection of "saints," the naming of 
saints, and 
Bessie brought out an 
album of photos and newspaper clippings that document her past St. 
Josep 's 
t-ames. 
She also showed us a book about saints that she 
uses when she needs to select the names of saints. 
After we finished the recording session (about 12:20), Bessie 
showed us a number of artifacts in her living room and bedroom. 
These included a number of family photos (especially a large tinted 
photo of her late husband's parents) , crocheted items she has made, 
a color print (lithograph?) of St. Joseph, and religious statues. 
She also showed us a large wooden steamer trunk that was given to 
her (by her parents?) when she got married. 
Originally, the trunk 
/contained a large number of linens and other textile items that the 
,.,/contained 
 
would need in her new home. 
She said the trunk still contains some 
of these things_. 
We recorded until 12:20 and departed about 45 minutes later. 
I took a few black and white and color photos during the 
interview session, and later on Paula took a few shots in the 
living room and the bed room. 
We borrowed a number of photos and newspaper clippings that 
I will copy and return later. 
Let me also note that when I visited Bessie in March I 
borrowed a Videotape of her last St. Joseph's table, a tape made 
by her daughter-in-law. 
A copy of the tape has been accessioned 
as: 
IAW-DT-V001.

Informant/Event: Fourth of July Parade at Pueblo West 
Coworker: Light, Ken; Hardin, Jim 
Site: 6 
At about 11 this morning Ken Light, Jim Hardin and I drove 
from our motel to the community of Pueblo West in order to document 
the annual Fourth of July Parade. 
Ken had spotted a notice about 
the parade in a small shoppers' magazine he'd picked up. 
The 
Pueblo Chieftain, the local daily newspaper, hadn't mentioned it, 
nor any other parade in the area. 
At any rate, since we didn't 
have anything scheduled until our visit with the Collette family 
this afternoon, the three of us decided to check out the parade. 
Pueblo West is a newer part of greater Pueblo and appears to 
consist mainly of single story brick homes on large lots. 
Many of 
these houses are situated on a large slope that overlooks the 
Sangre de Cristo mountain range to the west. 
We pulled into a parking lot behind a strip of shops where the 
parade was being organized, 
got out of the car and began to 
investigate what was going on. 
We saw a variety of groups taking 
their places in the line of the parade and waiting around until the 
parade commenced. 
In many ways the components of the parade 
resembled what one might expect to find in small town parades 
elsewhere in the country. 
Groups included: 
a small marching band 
("The Pride City Band"), decorated fire trucks and other municipal 
vehicles, kids on decorated bikes, baton twirlers, vintage autos, 
and floats sponsored by local civic organizations. 
A Native 
American man carrying an American flag and accompanied by two 
children stood at the head of the parade. 
This small group caught 
Ken's attention and he went over to take a number of photos. 
Ken 
told me that he man said he is a Tiwa Indian, originally from New 
Mexico. 
His name is Frank Goodhunt and he lives at 892 S. Dante 
Drive, Pueblo West, CO 
81007. 
A couple of political candidates also matched along the parade 
route to shake hands and boost their campaigns for office. 
One of 
the candidates attracted our particular attention: 
Dan Corsentino, 
an Italian-America running for sheriff. 
While we waited for the parade to get underway, Ken and I took 
photos of some of the participants. 
When the parade finally 
started up, Ken, Jim, and I walked along with it. 
I took photos 
of parade participants and spectators, and Ken did the same. 
I 
alerted Ken to candidate Corsentino and he made a point of getting 
a lot of shots of Corsentino as he walked along the route shaking 
hands. 
At one point, Ken jumped up on the back of the pick-up 
truck accompanying Corsentino (he first obtained permission to do 
IAW-DT-F070490.A - 
2 
so) . 
I'll guess that we walked along with the parade for about an 
hour before deciding we had seen about all that could be seen and 
headed back to the car. 
I'll add that the sun was blazing hot and 
the temperature must have been close to 100 degrees. 
Before we got 
back to the car the parade obviously ended since everyone was 
heading back to the start of the route. 
We spotted Dan Corsentino 
and waved him over. 
I gave him one of our project booklets, said 
a few words about what we were doing, and asked if we could get 
together with him for an interview. 
He said "sure," gave us one 
of his business cards (he is the current county undersheriff), and 
said to call him at his office in order to set something up. 
He 
drove off and Ken, Jim, and I got into our car and drove back to 
the motel.

Informant/Event: 4th of July at the Collettes

Site: 6 
The entire field team has been invited for come to the home 
of Al and JoAnna Collette for their annual family celebration of 
the 4th of July. 
(I'll 
note that the documentation of the 
observance of the 4th of July by one or more Italian-American 
families was one of the tasks I hoped to accomplish during our stay 
in Pueblo. 
In fact, during the initial planning for this phase of 
our research, I took this into account.) 
Al and JoAnna Collette are among our first contacts in Pueblo; 
John Williams and I met them during our first visit to the city in 
March, 1990. 
During the first couple of days that our field team 
was in Pueblo (in June), I'd instructed them to be on the look-out 
for opportunities to document family celebrations on the 4th, and 
mentioned to 
Paola Tavarelli and Paula Manini 
(who would be 
interviewing Al and JoAnna about their St. Joseph's day traditions) 
that the Collettes might be willing to accommodate us. 
In any 
event, it came to pass that Al and JoAnna invited us to join them 
on the 4th, when, as part of their family's tradition, they'd be 
hosting a large 
number 
of 
relatives 
at 
their 
home 
to 
eat, 
socialize, and shoot off fireworks. 
A couple of days ago, when we spoke to Al and JoAnna about the 
appropriate time for us to drop by on the 4th, they'd said that the 
middle of the afternoon would be best. 
Therefore, at about 3:30, 
Russell Frank, Ken Light, Jim Hardin and I drove to the Collette 
home at 1 Encino Place in Pueblo. 
Since they had a couple of 
errands to run, Paola Tavarelli and Paula Manini planned to join 
us a couple of hours later. 
Al and JoAnna live in a large two-story brick house on a 
corner lot in a relatively new development in the southwestern part 
of town. 
Their home is similar to others in the area; it seems to 
be a rather prosperous neighborhood. 
We parked along the street, 
and Russell, 
Ken, 
Jim and I 
entered a gate that led into the Collette's back yard. 
There we 
were met by Al, who introduced us to his mother, his two sons (Tim 
and John), and two daughters (Stephanie and Teresa). 
JoAnna was 
working in the kitchen, but she soon came out and greeted us as 
well. 
Incidentally, we brought along a couple of cases of beer and 
a couple of bottles of wine. 
Not much seemed to be going on outside. 
However, Al, with 
IAW-DT-F070490.B - 
2 
help from Teresa, was finishing the cooking of a batch of chicken 
on his big brick barbecue. 
His mother was sitting in the patio, 
so I pulled up a chair and had a chat with her. 
Al encouraged us 
to have drinks and eat snacks and we readily complied. 
Meanwhile, 
JoAnna went back inside the house where, 
I believe, 
she was 
whipping up more food for the meal to come. 
For the next couple of hours we mingled with members of the 
Collette family. 
And during this period more members of the family 
arrived carrying food and fireworks. 
Al's sister and her husband 
were among those who joined the gathering. 
As far as I could 
determine all the relatives who came live in Pueblo or nearby. 
By 
the time the whole crowd had arrived there were 35-40 in all. 
Paola and Paula showed up at about 5 p.m. and joined the multitude. 
Because there were so many people around, it was difficult to 
get a full sense of everything that was going on. 
In the backyard, 
where I spent most of my time, people were having drinks and eating 
snacks, and some of the boys were igniting firecrackers, bottle 
rockets and smoke bombs. 
John Collette (Al's son), who's in his 
late twenties or early thirties, 
appeared to be particularly 
captivated with fireworks. 
He took me out into the garage and 
showed me the huge quantity of fireworks that had been purchased 
for today's celebration. 
There were at least three big mesh bags 
(each nearly three feet long and 10 inches through the middle) 
crammed with a wide variety of explosives. 
He also showed me a 
quantity of three foot-long sparklers, 
and some lethal-looking 
rockets that would be part of his fireworks display later on. 
We went back outside and John, along with some of the younger 
boys, began to shoot off some of the fireworks: 
firecrackers, 
bottle rockets, 
flaming spinners, and smoke bombs. 
The bottle 
rockets (fired out of bottles or tubes) whizzed up into the air and 
some descended into the yards of neighbors. 
There seemed to be an 
almost limitless supply of two inch-long firecrackers, and everyone 
(kids and adults) seemed to think it was a great joke to toss them 
at each other so as to either surprise someone when they exploded, 
or force the other person to jump out of the way. 
In any case, the 
air was soon thick with blue smoke and the acrid smell of gun 
powder. 
Eventually, the call went out that it was time to eat, and 
everyone fell into a line that wound around a large quantity of 
food laid out for us on the kitchen counters. 
There was a great 
variety of food (including chicken, burgers, hot dogs, 
salads, 
vegetables, bread, and several desserts), but I do not recall any 
dishes that were particularly Italian. 
Nonetheless, the whole 
atmosphere was Italian: a huge family eating and talking together 
with great joviality. 
Some of us ate around tables set up outside 
on the patio, others ate indoors at a large dining table. 
After everyone ate, 
it was suggested that games be played. 
IAW-DT-F070490.B - 
3 
And just about everyone fell into the spirit of things, including 
the members of our research team. 
The first game (and one that 
included 
nearly 
everyone) 
was 
called 
"Where's 
the 
bear?" 
Basically, this game involved everyone assembling into a single 
line and then repeating a tongue-twister in turn until the end of 
the game, 
when the ring-leader 
(who knows the trick or catch 
ending) causes everyone to fall to the ground. 
(Confusing? 
Well, 
you had to have been there.) 
As daylight began to fade, more and more fireworks began to 
be shot off. 
Even the smallest kids participated in this, although 
they were only allowed to handle sparklers. 
(Apparently, sparklers 
are considered to be relatively safe for kids, even though they 
possess a white-hot flame when lit.) 
At one point a large number 
of sparklers were inserted in the ground and then lit, forming a 
striking pattern. 
A cloudburst put somewhat of a damper on the festivities, and 
some folks moved indoors for a while. 
However, when it was fully 
dark, around 8:30, it was announced that the fireworks display was 
about to commence and everyone trooped to the front of the house. 
Some--the 
"spectators"--took up 
seats 
along the 
front porch. 
Others--the pyrotechnicians--assembled the various rockets and 
other devices; John Collette seemed to play the most active role 
in this. 
As the spectators watched, a large number of fireworks 
were shot off from an area near the sidewalk in front of the house. 
Some of the fireworks went straight up and burst into brilliant 
colors, others jumped or hopped a few feet into the air before 
exploding or spinning off in surprising ways. 
A few errant rockets 
took off at frighteningly low angles. 
One such shot took off at 
about 45 degrees, streaked across the street, and smacked into a 
house, setting off its burglar alarm. 
After a moment of shocked 
silence, everyone reacted with amusement. 
Apparently, no one was 
at home in the house, 
since the burglar alarm rang and rang. 
Eventually a police car showed up and, as I recall, an officer 
figured out how to turn off the alarm. 
In any event, the fireworks display went on for some time, 
gradually building to a crescendo in the fashion of large municipal 
fireworks shows. 
Before the finale, one of the young guys (Tim 
Collette, I think) took out a cassette player, inserted a cassette 
tape and, as the final rockets were exploding, turned on the music. 
At this, everyone on the porch stood up and sang along to the 
music: 
"Proud to be an American" sung by Lee Greenwood. 
Quite a 
moment. 
It was clear that the family had done things in this 
fashion in the past since everyone seemed to know what was going 
to happen and what his or her role should be. 
The end of the 
fireworks also signalled the end of the 
celebration and gradually people began to pack up and prepare to 
leave. 
At about 10 p.m., we thanked the Collettes and headed back 
to the hotel. 
Though we had enjoyed being with the Collette 
IAW-DT-F070490.B -

family, 
it had been a very long session 
(nearly 7 hours for 
Russell, Ken, Jim, and me) and we were all rather bushed.

Informant/Event: Caputo, Silvio 
Coworker: 
Site: 6 
The article in the local newspaper about our project generated 
a few telephone calls. 
One caller was Silvio J. Caputo, Jr., an 
Italian-American who lives in Pueblo but grew up in the coal mining 
town of Trinidad, Colorado, another important community with regard 
to Italian settlement. 
In any case, he expressed interest in our 
project and offered his assistance. 
(I had previously heard of 
Caputo from Kerry Kramer. 
Kerry told me that he had written a book 
about Italians in Trinidad called The Death of Spring. 
I had been 
under the impression that Caputo lived in Trinidad, not Pueblo.) 
Caputo explained about his Trindad background and said he could 
recommend potential informants there if we wished to do research 
in that community. 
He said he has lived in Pueblo for 16 years, 
but isn't sure how much he could tell me about Pueblo's Italian 
community. 
We agreed that I would come over to his home this 
afternoon so that I could tell him more about our research and he 
would make whatever suggestions seemed appropriate. 
Silvio and his wife Rosalie live at 42 Posada Street, in a 
large, new home that's not far from Al and JoAnna Collette 
I s house. 
Silvio greeted me warmly and ushered me into his large living room. 
He introduced me to his wife Rosalie and their two small daughters. 
Silvio and Rosalie are in their early forties. 
Both teach in the 
Pueblo school system. 
Silvio teaches English and history and 
Rosalie teaches history, English, and Italian. 
As I understand it, 
Rosalie is one of two teachers in the entire school system who 
offer classes in Italian language and culture. 
The courses were 
established about thirteen years ago, largely through the efforts 
of respected school principal Victoria Cristiano Marion (another 
of our IAW informants) and members of the local chapter of the 
Dante Alighieri Society. 
Rosalie grew up in Los Angeles. 
After I discussed the goals of our project, Silvio asked if 
I was familiar with his book, The Death of Spring (Port Washington, 
N.Y.: Ashley Books, 1984). 
I said I had heard of it but hadn't yet 
obtained a copy. 
He then produced a copy, which he autographed and 
gave me. 
The book is a historical novel set in Trinidad and nearby 
mining camps that focuses on the experiences of immigrant Italian 
coal miners. 
If we wish to conduct research in the Trinidad area, Silvio 
suggested that the following men would be good contacts: 
IAW-DT-F070590.A - 
2 
(1) Joe Bonacquista, 833 Park Street, Trinidad; phone 
846-3667. 
He was a coal miner and worked for Wyoming Fuel 
Company for eight years. 
(2) 
Joe Tarabino, 
who works 
at the Visitors' 
Center 
in 
downtown Trinidad; phone 846-7324. 
Silvio 
also 
suggested 
that 
the 
community 
of 
Cokedale 
represented a good example of a small mining community which still 
has residents of Italian descent. 
He said a helpful book about the 
community is: 
Cokedale: 
1907-1947, Anatomoy of a Model Mining 
Community (N.p.: N.P., 1976) by Holly Barton. 
When I asked about potential informants in Pueblo, Silvio and 
Rosalie didn't have too many ideas. 
They mentioned Victorian 
Cristiano Marion (who I plan to interview) as well as a few fairly 
recent emigrants from Italy: 
(1) Anna and Anthony Costanza, 33 Drake Street, Pueblo; phone 
564-5485. 
(2) Philip Costanza (Anthony's brother), 127 Fordham Circle, 
Pueblo; phone 564-3782. 
Before I left the Caputo home, Silvio and Rosalie gave me a 
tour of their small garden. 
It contained plum trees, grape vines, 
garlic, and oregano.

Coworker:

U 
Since an article about our project has appeared in the local 
newspaper, a few keenly interested people have tracked us down by 
phoning the reporter who wrote the story. 
Knowing that any 
publicity would likely lead to many calls and requests to be 
interviewed, I purposed decided not to ask the reporter to include 
our 
address 
and 
phone 
number 
in 
the 
article. 
(When 
this 
information was included in an article run 
in the San Pedro 
newspaper we were deluged with requests.) 
In any case, because all 
of our fieldworkers appeared to be fully occupied with leads that 
they'd developed, I decided that I would handle any calls that came 
in response to the newspaper story. 
In my experience unsolicited 
calls are usually a mixed bag and include valuable informants and 
leads as well as crack-pots and know-it-alls. 
However, I believe 
all calls should be handled courteously and this sometimes means 
that non-essential interviews must be scheduled. 
At any rate, 
one of the calls I received was from Frank 
Sruscella. 
In a challenging tone, he asked: 
"Are you only going 
to cover one side of the story of Italian-Americans in Pueblo?" 
I asked him to explain, and he said that our project should not 
focus 
attention 
only 
on 
prominent 
Italian-Americans 
in 
the 
community. 
I assured him that we sought to talk with Italian-
Americans from all walks of life. 
He said that, in that case, I 
should talk with him, since he had grown up in Pueblo and had been 
through a lot. 
He hinted that he had information that others would 
not tell me. 
It was clear that he wanted to talk with me, so we 
arranged an interview for 11:00 this morning. 
He didn't want me 
to come to his home, so we agreed that he would come to the motel. 
At 10:30 my phone rang and the motel receptionist told me that 
my someone had arrived to be interviewed. 
Since it was 30 minutes 
before the agreed 
upon time, I was rather irritated, but I went 
down to the office to meet Sruscella. 
I introduced myself and then 
led him back to my room for an interview. 
I was surprised that he 
offered no 
explanation 
or 
apology 
for 
arriving 
earlier than 
planned. 
Sruscella is a 69 years-old. 
He's a short man and he was 
wearing a blue suit and a snap-brim hat. 
I had tape recording equipment set up in my room, and when 
IAW-DT-F070690.A - 
2 
Sruscella saw it he asked if we could do an interview without 
recording it on tape. 
I said that would be fine. 
What followed 
was a rambling diatribe from Sruscella that lasted for about an 
hour and a half. 
Much of what he had to say (and he repeated 
himself incessantly) had to do either with discrimination against 
all Italian-Americans (especially by filmmakers) or discrimination 
against himself. 
He also explained that he commonly goes by the name Joseph 
DeShell. 
Apparently, this was the name given to his father when 
the 
emigrated 
from 
Italy 
and 
immigration 
officials 
couldn't 
pronounce his name. 
His parents came to the U.S. from Calabria in 1910 or 1912. 
His mother and father met in Pueblo. 
His father worked for CF & 
I for over 40 
years. 
There were 6 children in the family, 
including Frank. 
The family home was on Box Elder Street in the 
neighborhood near CF & I. 
After graduating from high school, Frank worked at CF & I and 
was then drafted into the air force during World War II. 
After his 
release, he completed a B.A. (1950), then went to get a better job 
at CF & I. 
He was shocked that, despite his college degree, the 
only job he was offered was a laborer's job. 
He felt he was being 
discriminated 
against 
because 
he 
is 
Italian. 
He 
filed 
discrimination charges against CF & I, but lost the case. 
Frank is a realtor by profession. 
He studied law but did not 
receive a degree. 
He believes that the annual Columbus Day banquet should be a 
forum for speaking out about discrimination against Italians. 
In 
particular, he is appalled by the stereotype of Italians as Mafia 
figures that is often portrayed in films and television programs. 
"Why can't the networks and film makers show us as we really are?", 
he asked. 
"Why can't they show families? 
Why can't they show the 
Toscaninis?" 
When he has written 
letters 
of protest to 
TV 
networks, he has received form letters in reply. 
Concerning the Columbus Day banquet, 
he said he has told 
Charlie Musso (event organizer): 
"Let me speak at Columbus Day. 
Lock the doors and let me speak. 
It won't be another Uncle Tom 
speech." 
He said he has urged Musso to "get rid of the phony 
politicians." 
He has appeared on local TV commentary programs to speak about 
negative stereotyping of Italians. 
He thinks that local Italian-
Americans want to be silent about negative stereotypes, they don't 
want to rock the boat. 
He said he has been threatened verbally and 
in writing because he spoke out. 
He remarked: 
"I don't like ethnic jokes. 
I don't like 'WOP.' 
IAW-DT-F070690.A - 
3 
I don't like 'Mafia staff car' on bumper stickers." 
He related that his brother was unfairly fired from his job 
with the city as a result of a "conspiracy to get rid of him." 
He 
implied that the fact that he was Italian had something to do with 
it and observed, "If he had been a black or a hispanic, they would 
have been picketing. 
But here in Pueblo, they don't want to make 
waves." 
While he characterizes himself as a fighter for Italian-
American civil rights, he does not belong to any organizations. 
He believes that many organizations have lost their focus. 
"I make 
people uneasy," he said, "but I like my role. 
I've lived this life 
and I know discrimination." 
He asked rhetorically: 
"Who is Frank Sruscella? 
I'm a person 
who isn't afraid to speak up." 
He also spoke about the development of Pueblo and observed 
that he disagreed with the city's recent policy of offering large 
incentives to businesses in order to persuade them to settle in the 
city. 
He said: 
"Entrepreneurs come in and they don't pay any 
taxes. 
They don't come when times are good, they come when times 
are bad, and they are subsidized by the city. 
Alot of these people 
didn't come out of the goodness of their hearts, they came for free 
stuff like utilities and roads." 
Our interview concluded at about 12:15 and Frank went on his 
way. 
We parted cordially and I think he appreciated having the 
opportunity to blow off a little steam. 
Frank's address is: 
2116 Vinewood Lane, Pueblo, CO 
81005. 
(In the telephone book it's 
listed under the name Joseph F. 
DeShell.)

Informant/Event: Corsentino, Dan 
Coworker: Light, Ken 
Site: 6 
At a little after 1 p.m., Ken Light and I drove to the Pueblo 
County Sheriff's office, at 909 Court Street, for the purpose of 
talking with Undersheriff Dan Corsentino. 
Ken and I met Corsentino 
at the Pueblo West Fourth of July parade when we spotted him 
campaigning for the office of county sheriff. 
I phoned him 
yesterday to set up our meeting today. 
Ken and I reported to the receptionist at the sheriff's office 
and were "buzzed in." 
We met Corsentino's secretary who escorted 
us to his office. 
There Dan greeted us and asked us to take seats 
neat his desk. 
I began to explain about our project but was 
interrupted several times by phone calls that came in for Dan. 
He 
seemed to respond to the calls as if we were not there, and I 
sensed that he enjoyed playing the role of tough and efficient law 
enforcement officer with Ken and me as an audience. 
Eventually, 
I was able to finish my description of the project and then told 
Dan that we wanted to talk with him because he is an Italian-
American and a life-long resident of Pueblo. 
I added that we were 
also interested in learning about his job and the perspective on 
the city it provided him. 
With barely a pause, Dan immediately launched into a brief 
personal history, followed by a detailed explanation of the current 
state of the sheriff's department. 
Apparently, the last three 
sheriff's, including the incumbent, have been involved in all sorts 
of illegal or shady activities and have been forced out of office. 
According to Dan, the current sheriff got involved in some sort of 
illegal arms deal and, after this was made public, has stopped 
coming to the office. 
As a result, Dan is the acting sheriff. 
Dan is about 39 years old. 
He grew up on Abriendo Avenue in 
Pueblo in a house behind the candy store 
("Sambo's") 
that his 
father ran. 
He has a B.A. from the University of Colorado. 
In the 
past, he worked as an administrative aide to Congressman Evans of 
Colorado, and later worked for Congressman Tunney of California. 
He worked for Gary Hart's 1988 presidential campaign. 
He presently 
lives in the area of Pueblo known as University Park. 
Before I could ask about setting up my tape recorder and doing 
an interview, Dan suggested that he give Ken and me a tour of his 
domain. 
We agreed and for the next 45 minutes or so, Dan lead us 
through the many floors and corridors of the county jail. 
He 
showed us various cell blocks and exercise areas and glimpse a 
number of prisoners 
in 
orange overalls who regarded us with 
IAW-DT-F070690.B - 
2 
considerable curiosity. 
As usual, Ken was festooned with his many 
cameras. 
Dan's attractive secretary accompanied us, 
and her 
presence generated a great number of whistles, 
catcalls, 
and 
lascivious smacking of lips. 
Dan kidded her about the commotion, 
but she seemed to take it all in stride. 
Incidentally, a large 
majority of the prisoners were of Hispanic descent. 
Of course, we also met quite a few police officers as we 
toured the jail, especially when we passed through locked control 
points. 
Dan proudly introduced us to everyone, noting loudly: 
"these guys are visiting from Washington." 
Some of the officers 
greeted 
Dan 
with 
enthusiasm, 
others 
greeted 
him 
coolly 
and 
perfunctorily. 
One reason for this difference, as Dan explained 
later, was that some members of the department are backers of his 
republican opponent in the race for the sheriff's office who is 
also a current member of the department 
(Perko, 
by name, 
a 
"Bojohn"). 
After we'd gone through many of the key areas of the large, 
multi-story jail, Dan led us outside and took us to the "old jail" 
that's located in the basement of the county courthouse. 
He 
explained that this facility is now used mainly to house "work-
release" convicts. 
After we entered through a large and heavy 
steel door Ken and I were immediately struck by the oppressive and 
gloomy atmosphere of the place. 
As we walked along a narrow 
corridor illuminated by low florescent lights we passed cells with 
heavy doors and one narrow slit each. 
At the end of the corridor, 
Dan rapped on a door, identified himself and the door was pulled 
open by a convict. 
Before the door was opened very far, 
Dan 
shouted "Stand back" and the convict jumped back about three feet. 
(I gathered that this was a standard command intended to keep 
prisoners a safe distance from officers.) 
We entered a large room 
with a number of bunkbeds at the back and, in a low voice, Dan 
explained that they were occupied by sleeping prisoners who had 
just returned from their work-release jobs. 
We took a quick look 
around and then turned to leave. 
As we were about to go back out 
through the door, I happened to glance at a small dining table and 
was surprised to see a copy of the local newspaper opened to the 
article about our project. 
We then went upstairs into the courthouse and Dan showed us 
a couple of courtrooms and introduced us to lawyers, judges and 
other staff members we encountered along the way. 
Dan seemed to 
know everyone and everyone knew Dan, and he was clearly enjoyed 
this opportunity to show off as he showed us around. 
Finally, we left the courthouse and returned to Dan's office. 
I figured that we'd now get around to recording an interview, 
provided Dan had the time, or we'd arrange to get together for an 
interview later on. 
In any case, we'd start taken our seats in his 
office when an officer came in and told Dan that a call was coming 
in from an officer "in trouble" and that Dan should listen to it. 
IAW-DT-F070690.B -

Dan then flipped on some sort of speaker that amplified a radio 
call into the room. 
I couldn't hear the call too clearly but the 
officer seemed to be saying that there had been an accident and 
that he needed assistance. 
He said this in a very halting manner. 
Dan asked him a couple of questions, got replies that I couldn't 
make out, and then jumped up out of his chair. 
Turning to us, he 
said: 
"I've got to go. 
You guys can stay here or come with me." 
We said we'd come along and followed him out of the building at a 
brisk pace and jumped into his car. 
I sat in the back and Ken sat 
up front. 
As he peeled out of the parking lot with his red patrol 
light flashing, 
Dan explained that there had been an accident 
outside 
of 
town on 
Highway 
25 
and 
that 
an 
officer 
needed 
assistance. 
He turned onto the highway heading north and floored 
it, cursing that the Ford cruiser didn't have much power. 
Within 
a couple or minutes, we were blasting down the highway at 90-95 
mph. 
When we were a few miles north of Pueblo, I caught sight of 
a tall, black column of smoke billowing up from the roadway. 
This 
looked chillingly serious. 
Up to this point I had no idea of the 
nature of the accident we were rushing to investigate. 
As we came 
closer to the source of the smoke we saw that traffic in both the 
northbound and southbound lanes had been halted by police officers. 
Dan pulled the car over to the shoulder and parked and we jumped 
out and crossed over to the southbound lane. 
There were observed 
the source of the smoke: 
a police cruiser and a compact car were 
crumpled together and engulfed in flames and thick, black smoke. 
A few hundred yards down the road a van with a speedboat hitched 
behind had gone off the road. 
Dan trotted across the median strip to confer with other 
policemen and Ken and I followed. 
An ambulance pulled up just we 
be arrived at the southbound land and medics went over to tend to 
the police officer who'd been injured in the crash. 
He was 
stretched out in the back on patrol car and the medics carefully 
strapped him onto a board and transferred him to the ambulance. 
As he was being strapped down, Dan spoke to him and told him that 
he'd inform the officer's father that he had been injured. 
Apparently, the had happened was the following: 
a woman in 
a small car had a flat tire and pulled over on the left should of 
the highway to change it. 
The police officer spotted her and 
pulled over behind her car and got out to offer assistance. 
As he 
was walking to the woman's car, the van with the boat came along 
and crashed into the police car, which ploughed into the woman's 
car. 
Both cars burst into flames. 
The van and the boat veered off 
the road to the right. 
Apparently, the policeman was knocked into 
the car by the impact and may have broken a leg. 
Except for a 
minor cut, the woman was uninjured. 
While the officer was being placed in the ambulance and 
firefighters arrived to put out the fire, Ken and I photographed 
the scene. 
Within a few minutes reporters from the local newspaper 
and TV station arrived and began to document the accident, too. 
IAW-DT-F070690.B - 
4 
I remember thinking that Ken and I (the Library of Congress news 
team) 
were the first documenters of the scene. 
I think the 
newspeople were curious about who we were, but I suppose the red 
Sheriff's Department I. D. cards clipped to our shirts imbued us 
with some sort of official status. 
After Dan submitted to brief interview by the reporters, the 
three of us, along with a detective, got into Dan's car and drove 
to St. Mary-Corwin Hospital in Pueblo where the injured officer had 
been taken. 
After we arrived, Ken and I waited around for a half an hour 
or so as Dan and other officers checked on the injured officer, 
whose name is Mario Maccaluso. 
(He's an Italian-American native 
of Pueblo, and his father works at the CF and I mill.) 
Later, Dan 
informed us that it appeared that Maccaluso did not suffer broken 
bones after all, but as badly shaken up and would stay in the 
hospital for observation. 
Eventually, we got back in Dan's car and he gave us a brief 
tour of his old neighborhood on Abriendo Avenue. 
We then drove 
over to his mother's house so he could ask her to pick up his 
daughter at school. 
We returned to Dan office and chatted for a few minutes more. 
He recommended that we contact a few other prominent Italian-
Americans in connection with our study. 
Those he named were: 
--Dan DeRose, a former professional football player who now 
coaches the city's minor league pro team, the Pueblo Crusaders. 
--Tony Fortino, semi-retired owner of Fortino-Jackson Ford 
(auto dealership). 
--Sollie Raso, retired school principal and football coach who 
is now the head of the county's board of commissioners. 
Dan picked up the phone and tried to called DeRose, but he was 
not at his office. 
He then called Raso, who was in. 
Dan told him 
about our project and said he should talk with us. 
Apparently, 
Raso was willing to cooperate and asked when I wanted to see him. 
I told Dan "4 p.m. on Tuesday" and he proceeded to confirm the 
appointment with Raso. 
(Obviously, I didn't have much choice in 
the matter of scheduling an appointment with Raso. 
I hoped it 
would turn out to be worthwhile.) 
By this time, it was a few minutes past 5 p.m. and Dan said 
he had to leave. 
He told us where he and his wife would be going 
for drink later on and invited us to join them after 7 p.m. 
We 
said we might see them later. 
As to the matter of setting up a recording session with Dan, 
IAW-DT-F070690.B -

we agreed that we'd try to get together before I left Pueblo.

Informant/Event: Interview with Dionisio Family 
Coworker: Tavarelli, Paola 
Site: 6 
Paola Tavarelli and I drove out to Vineland for an interview 
Paola had arranged with members of the Dionisio fam_i1_y_, a far_7Di,ng 
family that has been located in the area for some time. 
Paola had 
previousl-y— m
—e
-t some members of the family, includ gn 
Patt_y_Th4lnas 
Dionisio 
(wife 
of 
Charles 
"Chuck" 
Dionisio"). 
Pat_tv_iz--the 
daughter of Esther and Tony Thomas (originally: DiTomaso) who live 
a short distance down the road. 
At 2 p.m. we arrived at the home of Russell Dionisio, Jr., 
located at 
1207 
39th Lane and knocked on the door. 
No one 
answered, but, since cars and trucks were parked nearby, we figured 
someone was around. 
We walked around to the back of the large 
barn-like structure that serves as a storage area for the farm's 
produce, a loading dock, and an office. 
Entering the building, we 
made our way to the small office where we found several members of 
the family. 
Since I hadn't met any of these folks before, I let 
Paola take the lead. 
She introduced me around and then we got 
ready to do a tape recorded interview. 
The people present were: 
Russell ("Big Russell") Dionisio, Jr., Charles ("Chuck") Dionisio 
(Russell's brother), Patty Thomas Dionisio (Chuck's wife), Charles 
Thomas ("C.T.") Dionisio (Chuck and Patty's son), and Bob Bragg (a 
nephew of the Dionisios). 
Someone phoned the family patriarch, 
Russell Dionisio, Sr. 
(Russell and Chuck's father) and he joined 
us in the office within ten minutes or so. 
While we waited for Russell, 
Sr., 
I set up the recording 
equipment. 
This consisted of a Nagra reel-to-reel tape recorder 
and a Sennheiser mike with cardioid tip mounted on a mike stand. 
Since an air conditioner was making quite a racket, I asked that 
it be turned off doing the interview and this was done. 
When Russell, Sr., arrived Paola and I explained the purpose 
of our visit and mentioned some of the topics we were interested 
in exploring during the interview. 
I got Russell, Sr., and his two 
sons to sit close together to permit a good sound level. 
Patty, 
who seemed content to let the men do most of the talking, 
sat 
behind a desk off to my left. 
Bob Bragg, the teen-aged nephew, sat 
near her and didn't have much to say during the interview. 
Young 
C.T. 
(Patty and Chuck's son) 
sat near me during most of the 
interview and seemed fascinated by my recording equipment. 
I let 
him monitor the recording through the headphones from time to time. 
Paola sat 5 or 6 feet away on my left and took photos from time to 
time. 
As things turned out, I asked most of the questions during 
the interview. 
IAW-DT-F070790.A - 
2 
I began the interview by asking everyone to introduce himself 
or herself and tell his or her birthdate. 
I then focussed 
attention on Russell, Sr., and got him to talk about his family 
background and his career as a farmer and a trucker of farm 
produce. 
He explained that his father came 
 to the United States 
from 
—
Sicily and obtained a job  at the zinc smelting_oper-ation-.down 
the___xoad 
-i 
 
n—Blende . 
He saved money and bought some land in 
Vineland then grew vegetables to feed his family and to sell in 
Pueblo. 
Russell, Sr., used to help his father peddle produce. 
Eventually, Russell, Sr., decided that more money could be made by 
purchasing produce from other local farmers and trucking it to 
distant cities in Kansas and California. 
Witchita, Kansas, was an 
important market for his vegetables. 
My sense is that Russell, 
Sr., liked this kind of work more than he liked farming. 
When Russell, Jr., and his younger brother Chuck (they are two 
years apart in age) were in high school, they decided that they 
would give farming a try. 
So, they leased some land, grew a crop 
and managed to make some money. 
Their knowledge of farming grew 
gradually and they began to lease more land. 
Eventually, they were 
able to purchase land. 
They explained that, 
at 
first, 
they 
encountered some difficulty in leasing and buying land because 
local land owners were reluctant to conduct business with Italians. 
Consequently, the first plots of land they were able to lease were 
of marginal quality. 
And, when they were prepared to purchase 
land, they were able to obtain some only because a non-Italian 
friend (a respected local farmer) purchased it from the bigoted 
owner and then resold it to them. 
Russell, Jr., and Chuck are very 
proud of their success---success borne of persistence and bard 
work. 
Much of the interview dealt with the details o _the operation 
of the family business and  covered such topics,as: 
crops drawn, 
annual cycle of activities, water rights, 
 and marketin g. 
I found 
the topic of water rights to be especially interesting and got 
Russell, Jr., and Chuck to describe the structure of the local 
water cooperative that regulates irrigation. 
Near the end of the interview, 
Paola asked a number of 
questions about family celebrations. 
As it happens it was Russell, 
Sr.'s 80th birthday on the 4th of July, and there was a big family 
gathering to celebrate it. 
(This would have been a great event to 
document, but, unfortunately, we didn't know about it in advance.) 
The interview finally concluded at about 4:45 and Paola and 
I chatted with the Dionisios for a few more minutes. 
Patty is a 
school teacher and she talked about the importance of getting 
students to recognize their own cultural traditions. 
We asked if it would be possible to return another day with 
Ken Light so he could take photos of typical activities around the 
IAW-DT-F070790.A -

farm. 
They said this would be fine. 
I enjoyed this interview and think we collected much good data 
about farming in this area.

p.m., 
Ken 
Light 
and 
I took 
photographs from the top of the Thatcher Building, located at 50 
Main Street in downtown Pueblo. 
This building is one of the 
tallest in the city and it's a good vantage point for shots of the 
city, including the CF & I plant at the south end of town. 
Ken had 
been up on the building a couple of days ago when a friendly 
custodian had let him up on the roof. 
Ken had been quite impressed with the view from the building 
and talked me into renting a special lens that would allow him to 
capture .just the shot he is after. 
In any case, armed with our 
camera gear 
(including the 
special 
lens), 
we arrived at the 
building and attempted to find the custodian who had let Ken in 
previously. 
Unfortunately, however, the building was locked up and 
no one was in sight. 
Ken and I cased the place, but couldn't see 
anyone. 
Reluctant to give up since we would have the lens for only 
24 hours, we waited around until Clyde the custodian was finally 
spotted. 
After phoning the building 
supervisor we 
obtained 
permission to go up on the roof. 
We took many shots in black and white and in color and then 
departed. 
Ken took a couple of shots of Clyde, whose name and 
address is: 
Clyde Hayes, 126 W. Pitkin, Pueblo, CO

I said 
I'd send him a print.

Informant/Event: Victoria Cristiano Marion 
Coworker: 
Site: 6 
As I've noted earlier, one of the tasks I've assigned myself 
as field director is to handle calls for interviews and to conduct 
interviews 
that would distract other 
fieldworkers 
from their 
assignments. 
Accordingly, some of the interviews I've done in 
Pueblo have been with prominent members of the Italian-American 
community. 
One such individual is Victoria Cristiano Marion, a 
retired 
school 
principal who 
is 
greatly 
respected by 
fellow 
Italian-Americans not only for her contributions to the city's 
educational system, but for her role in establishing courses in 
Italian language and culture as part of the curriculum, and in 
establishing the Pueblo chapter of the Dante Alighieri Society. 
Several people had mentioned that Mrs. 
Marion should be 
interviewed, and so I was not especially surprised when she phoned 
me to 
let me 
know she 
had 
information to 
share. 
And the 
implication was that if we were doing a serious study we had to 
speak with her. 
And, as I discovered later, she was quite right. 
(Like many successful people who are passionate about something, 
she 
was 
not 
timid 
about 
phoning 
me 
directly 
to 
offer 
her 
assistance. 
After all, she and many other prominent individuals 
owe their success to their ability to take the bull by the horns.) 
In any case, during our phone conversation a couple of days ago we 
agreed that I would come to her home 
for an interview this 
afternoon. 
Mrs. Marion lives in a tidy single story home at 730 Westacres 
Avenue in Pueblo. 
She greeted me at the door when I knocked and 
led me through the living room and into a small alcove that held 
a dining room table, chairs and a china cabinet. 
We sat down 
around the table and I began my usual explanation of the project. 
In anticipation of my visit, Mrs. Marion had assembled a lot of 
material for my inspection, 
including family photos, 
newspaper 
clippings, Dante Alighieri Society publications, and a short essay 
about Pueblo's Italian community that she had written. 
She wanted 
to show me these materials first and launched into descriptions of 
the individual items right away. 
After a few minutes, I was able 
to explain that I wanted to tape record this and other information 
and asked if this would be alright with her. 
She gave her consent, 
so I set up the Nagra and began the recording. 
I'll note that Mrs. Marion is a thin woman in her late sixties 
or early seventies. 
She had clearly dressed up for my visit; she 
was wearing a stylish red dress and had applied make-up. 
The interview was lengthy and detailed and included much 
IAW-DT-F070890.A - 
2 
information 
about 
Mrs. 
Marion's 
family 
background, 
and 
her 
experiences as a school teacher and later a principal. 
She was a 
school teacher at the Danforth School, located at 900 Elm Street 
in the Bessemer neighborhood near the steel mill. 
Accordingly, she 
had a large number of students of Italian descent in her classes. 
She 
also 
talked 
about 
her 
involvement with 
Italian 
cultural 
organizations, and attitudes towards Italians during World War II. 
She explained that during the war a contingent of Italian prisoners 
of war was stationed in Pueblo. 
Apparently this group was somewhat 
unique in that they volunteered to waive their rights under the 
Geneva Convention and contribute labor towards the allied war 
effort. 
In any case, Mrs. Marion discussed her contact with the 
prisoners, which came about because she could speak Italian with 
them and helped make them feel more comfortable in the strange 
environment of Pueblo. 
Her family and other Italian-American 
families in Pueblo invited some of the prisoners to their homes for 
Thanksgiving and other holidays. 
She developed lasting friendships 
with some of these men. 
For example, she stayed in contact with 
the commander of the contingent, Captain Roberto Marini, and even 
visited him in Italy after the war. 
In 1981, Mrs. Marion was instrumental in establishing a class 
for instruction in the Italian language at East High School. This 
development was discussed extensively in our interview. 
Toward the end of the interview, Mrs. Marion's husband Vincent 
came into the house through the back door. 
He had been working in 
the garden out back. 
He greeted me warmly but soon made himself 
scarce. 
I gathered that he didn't want to intrude on his wife's 
interview. 
Mrs. Marion later told me that Vincent was born in 
Italy (Palermo, Sicily) and had moved to the United States in the 
1950s. 
(He had been in the Italian army during the war.) 
He 
courted Victoria vigorously (I believe he had been a student in an 
adult-ed English class she taught) and they were married in Pueblo. 
When the interview came to a close, I asked to borrow some of 
the items Mrs. Marion had shown me in order to make copies, and 
she permitted me to take them. 
These items included: 
several 
black and white photos, an arm patch worn by one of the Italian 
prisoners of war (the patch reads: "Italy"), a 10-page essay by 
Mrs. 
Marion titled 
"The Italians 
in the Pueblo Area," a old 
membership roster from the Pueblo chapter of the Dante Alighieri 
Society, and a program from the Dante Aligieri Society's annual 
"carnevale" (a costume ball held in February, after Epiphany).

Informant/Event: Gathering at the Home of Ken and Susan Cuchiara 
Coworker: Tavarelli, Paola; Light, Ken 
Site: 6 
A few days ago I received a call from another person who had 
read the article about our project in the local newspaper and 
wished to offer assistance. 
Her name is Susan Cuchiara, and she 
began the conversation by saying that she and her husband have a 
large collection of family photos that they have been given by 
various members of the extended family. 
As I understand it, Susan 
and her husband Ken are so interested in the history of their 
families that other family members have passed on their photos for 
them to look after. 
Susan asked if I'd like to see the photos. 
I said that I would, and asked if it might also be possible to meet 
some members of the family and perhaps record an interview. 
Susan 
said this sounded like a good idea and that she would see what she 
could do arrange for a few relatives to be present when I come 
over. 
We agreed that I would come to her home at 5:30 p.m. today. 
She noted in passing that she and her husband had recently moved 
back to Pueblo from Las Vegas, so the household was in a bit of an 
uproar. 
Early this afternoon, I received a call from Susan. 
She 
called to confirm our interview later today. 
I asked how many 
people might be present and was surprised when she said that more 
than a dozen members of her extended family would be there to meet 
me. 
I said "great" and told her I'd be over at the time we'd 
agreed. 
I then asked Paola Tavarelli to accompany me to the 
interview since I was sure I'd feel rather overwhelmed by all the 
people. 
Paola and I arrived at Ken and Susan Cuchiara's house at 5:30. 
Their home is a large and fairly new ranch-style brick house 
located at 55 Fordham Circle in Pueblo. 
Susan greeted us at the 
door and led us in the living room. 
A number of her relatives were 
there and she introduced us around; more relatives arrived within 
the next few minutes. 
In front of a large fireplace, Susan had 
arranged a many old and new family photos of family members. 
Some 
of the photos were wedding pictures, 
others were portraits of 
individuals or couples. 
Some of the older photos were mounted in 
gold oval frames. 
Arranged in this manner, the images were quite 
powerful. 
Susan remarked that they represented five generations 
of the extended family. 
Impressed by the photos as well as the size of the gathering 
of people in the living room, I decided to phone our photographer, 
Ken Light, and ask him to come over to take pictures of the scene. 
I reached Ken and he said he'd be over in a few minutes. 
IAW-DT-F070890.B - 
2 
Within about 20 minutes of our arrival, Susan told me that 
everyone she had invited had arrived. 
Everyone took seats in the 
living room and I then explained why Paola and I had come to see 
them. 
Paola and I sat in folding chairs in front of the fireplace, 
and Susan sat beside me. 
Everyone else sat in front of us, either 
on one of the two couches or on a chair. 
The sheer size of the 
gathering was impressive--I counted nineteen people--and I wondered 
what strategy would be best to interview this many people at once. 
In 
addition 
to 
Paola 
and me 
(and 
later 
Ken) 
those 
in 
attendance were: 
Ken and Susan Cuchiara and their son Anthony, 
Marianne Cuchiara Everett 
(Ken's sister) 
and her son Spencer, 
Anthony "Spud" Ferraro and his wife Palma DeLuca Ferraro (Susan's 
parents), Charles Cuchiara and Carmella Moroney Cuchiara (Ken's 
parents), Tony Fortino, Barbara Moroney Fortino, Stacey Fortino, 
Joe Ferraro, 
Ann Ferraro, 
Marie Cuchiara Fabian, 
Mary Louise 
Moroney, Ann Cuchiara, Francis DeLuca, Charles DeLuca. 
After I finished my explanation, I turned on the tape recorder 
(the Marantz cassette recorder) and began the recording. 
I started 
out by going around the room, from my left to my right, and asked 
everyone to introduce himself or herself. 
Susan, sitting beside 
me, helped me keep the various relationships straight. 
When the 
introduction were over, I then asked everyone to tell me the story 
of how their family first came to the United States (or to Pueblo) . 
(This seemed to be a reasonable question to kick things off. 
And 
it occurred to me that, given the size of the group, it might be 
the only question I'd get to ask.) 
This seemed to work out fairly 
well and the stories rolled out. 
Ken arrived while this was going 
on and, after I quickly introduced him, he began to take photos of 
the interview session. 
After about 45 minutes of interviewing, I decided to call a 
temporary halt so that Ken to take a group photo. 
Since there was 
still a fair amount of light outdoors, Ken decided that it would 
be good to take everyone out into the backyard for the photo. 
Everyone was agreeable, so they trooped outside and lined up in 
rows according to Ken directions. 
We asked some to carry photos 
from Ken and Susan's collection and to hold them when Ken took the 
portrait. 
The photos they held were of persons related to them. 
A step-ladder was found for Ken and he stood on it in order 
to take photos of the group from the height he desired. 
While he 
was in the process of taking photos, I took a few photos of him in 
action. 
The photo session lasted about 20 minutes or so. 
After 
this, we all returned to the house where Susan served everyone 
refreshments, consisting of coffee, 
cakes, 
and cookies. 
After 
this, a few people had to leave. 
A core of other family members remained and, after 20 minutes 
or so, we all returned to the living room to resume the interview. 
IAW-DT-F070890.B - 
3 
Beginning at about 
8 p.m., this lasted for another hour or so. 
This portion of the interview explored other topics, 
including 
marriage practices (I segued into this because of the large number 
of wedding photos that surrounded us). 
Several informants provided 
personal experience narratives about their own weddings. 
Paola 
took the lead through most of this discussion since this is one of 
her areas of specialization. 
Since others had to leave, 
Paola and I (Ken had departed 
earlier) decided to call it a night, too. 
It had been a delightful 
evening, 
and 
I felt 
very 
good 
about 
the 
information 
we'd 
collected. 
As we were 
leaving, 
Susan told a story about a belief 
associated with St. Joseph. 
Apparently, it's a common belief that 
if you want to change your luck you should bury a statue of St. 
Joseph. 
She had buried a statue of the saint in the yard of their 
home in Las Vegas. 
Subsequently, their luck changed for the better 
and they decided to move back to Pueblo. 
Before they moved out of 
the old house she had to go back and dig up St. Joseph.

This morning at a little after 6 a.m., Ken Light and I drove 
to the Dionisio farm in Vineland in order to commence photographic 
coverage of typical daily activities there. 
I went along to 
introduce Ken to the Dionisios. 
Paola will join us at the Thomas's

Russell" Dionisio would be up and around soon after our arrival, 
but, aside from a couple of dogs in a pen behind his house, nothing 
seemed to be stirring. 
(When I spoke to him the other day, Russell 
said that work usually begins at about 6:30 on his farm.) 
So, we 
waited. 
At about 7, a van carrying 3-4 Mexican workers pulled into 
the drive, drove by us and parked at the edge of a field. 
This 
seemed to be a good sign, since we figured they were reporting for 
work. 
But since no one came out of the house. 
At 7:40 Russell 
Dionisio finally emerged from his house and went over to speak to 
the workers. 
After a few minutes, Ken and I walked over to them 
and waited for Russell to finish his conversation (which he carried 
on haltingly in Spanish.) 
Russell greeted me in a friendly manner, 
and I introduced him to Ken. 
Then I asked what sort of work would 
be going on at the farm today, 
he said "Not much." 
He then 
explained that, since it had rained heavily last night, the ground 
was too wet to cultivate. 
I remarked that, not being a farmer, 
this possibility hadn't occurred to me. 
He said there might be 
some activity around the farm later on in the day, but he wasn't 
sure. 
I said that Ken and perhaps Paola would drop back later. 
This was disappointing. 
I'd hoped that Ken would be able to 
spend a whole day with the Dionisios recording images of typical 
activities. 
Ken and I drove down the road to the Thomas's farm stand. 
Esther and Tony Thomas, who run the operation, were in the large 
storage building behind the farm stand and we went in to talk with 
them. 
Tony was 
supervising 
the 
loading 
of 
large 
boxes 
of 
watermelons (grown elsewhere) onto a truck. 
Three Mexican who work 
for the Thomases were packing zucchini squash (grown on the farm) 
into cardboard boxes. 
Ken photographed both of these activities. 
Paola showed up at 9, 
and we talked together for about 20 
minutes 
and 
I explained 
about 
the 
lack 
of 
activity 
at 
the 
Dionisios. 
I asked Paola and Ken to return to Vineland this 
IAW-DT-F070990.A - 
2 
afternoon to see what's going on at that time and photograph 
appropriate scenes. 
At 9:20 I drove back to Pueblo.

Coworker: Manini, Paula 
Site: 6 
Not long after I returned to our office after my early morning 
trip to Vineland, a woman by the name of Carolyn Cirullo Tollefson 
phoned to say she had read the newspaper article about our project 
and asked if we were interested in information she has about the 
celebration of St. Joseph's day in her family. 
I said we would be 
interested. 
She said she'd drop over in a few minutes if that 
would be convenient. 
I told her to come ahead. 
At 10 a.m. I met Ms. Tollefson at the hotel's front desk and 
escorted her to our office. 
She's a woman in the early forties who 
grew up in the Pueblo area. 
As a young woman she moved away to 
take a job in California. 
A few years ago she and her husband 
decided to come back to Pueblo when he was offered at job here as 
a hospital administrator. 
Since she wanted to talk about the observance of St. Joseph's 
day in her family, I let Paula take the lead in questioning her. 
Ms. Tollefson showed us black and white photos of St. Joseph's 
tables prepared by her grandmothers: Flora Cirullo and Josephine 
Barzileri. 
She also gave us a hand-written reminiscence she had 
composed for us titled "My Memories of St. Joseph's Day Tables." 
(A copy is in the project's files.) 
She agreed to let us keep the 
photos for a couple of days so we couple make copies. 
She stayed with us until 10:30, at which time she departed to 
attend to other chores. 
For the record, she can be reached at her husband's office:

Informant/Event: Tony and Joe Bacino 
Coworker: 
Site: 6 
Another person who phoned me in response to the article in the 
local newspaper about our project is Tony Bacino. 
He told me that 
he knew a lot about Italian-Americans in Pueblo and that we made 
wine, which I was welcome to sample. 
I told him I had heard of him 
from others in the community and that I had intended to call him. 
(Bacino had been described to other fieldworkers as "the Mayor of 
Goat Hill," Goat Hill being a neighborhood where many Italians 
moved after the big flood in the 1920s.) 
In any event, we agreed 
that I would come to his home for an interview at 2 p.m. today. 
After a few wrong turns, I arrived at Tony Bacino's house at 
218 S. Bradford Street about ten minutes late. 
(Bradford Street 
is interrupted by another street and continues in an unexpected 
location.) 
Goat Hill is 
indeed a pronounced hill that rises 
sharply above the rest of the community. 
It's located east of the 
center of the downtown area on the opposite side of Highway 25. 
The houses in the neighborhood are clustered closely together on 
streets that corkscrew up the hill. 
I parked in front of Bacino's house and lugged by recording 
gear to his side door. 
After a few knocks, Bacino came to the door 
and let me in. 
He is a short, solid fellow with white hair. 
I'd 
say he's in his mid-sixties (he gives his exact age on the tape 
recording). 
He projects a great deal of youthful energy and good 
humor, and throughout my visit he cracked jokes and make plenty of 
comments 
about 
Italians 
and 
others 
who 
take 
themselves 
too 
seriously. 
He has his own driver education school (established in 
1963, according to his business card) and, until he turned down the 
bell on his phone as we were about to begin the tape recorded 
interview, he received several calls from prospective students. 
He took me down into the basement of his house and showed me 
his large bar/lounge and, in another room, his wine cellar. 
The 
bar is decorated in red and black and there's a neon sign over the 
bar that reads: 
Bacino's Goat Hillton. 
A large refrigerator 
behind the bar holds many bottles of wine that Tony has made. 
The 
wine cellar contains several large barrels of wine (approximately 
12), a few dozen bottles of wine, wine-making accoutrements, and 
plastic grapes and old advertizing signs hanging from the walls. 
In one corner of the wine cellar several artifacts were mounted, 
artifacts that visually underscore Tony's penchant for spoofing 
negative stereotypes of Italians. 
These artifacts include: 
three 
large color photos depicting scenes from the film The Godfather, 
and a replica of a Thompson submachine gun. 
Tony remarked that he 
IAW-DT-F070990.0 - 
2 
thinks it's wrong for people to get worked up about negative 
stereotyping, and he thinks Italians would be better off if they 
made light of it like he does. 
We went back to the bar and Tony asked if I'd like him to 
bring over his older brother Joe, who lives across the street. 
He 
said that Joe has vivid memories of the flood that caused the 
family to move from "the Grove" (a Pueblo neighborhood in the path 
of the flood) to the higher ground of Goat Hill. 
I said "sure," 
and Tony went across the street to fetch his brother. 
During the 
15 minutes or so he was away I set up my recording equipment near 
the couch at one end of the bar. 
Tony returned with Joe and introduced me to him. 
Though 
getting on in years (his exact age is noted on the tape), Joe is 
extremely sharp of mind. 
Within a couple of minutes we were off 
on a long and fascinating interview. 
Both Joe and Tony are 
excellent raconteurs and their stories are among the best I've 
heard in Pueblo. 
Of particular interest were their stories about 
the flood, 
life on Goat Hill, working for a bootlegger (Joe's 
experience), running a bar, dice games that Italians gambled on, 
and wine-making. 
The two brothers seem very close and I'm sure the 
fact that they were together during this interview improved the 
quality of their narratives. 
With regard to Tony's wine-making, I was surprised to learn 
that he's been "on the wagon" since 1945. 
In other words, he makes 
wine but he doesn't drink it. 
When I asked him about this, he said 
he enjoys making wine for his friends to enjoy and he relies on 
them to tell him if it's any good. 
He said he regularly has 
parties in his bar for friends and he uses these occasions to bring 
out his various kinds of wine for them to sample. 
Before I left, Tony gave me a ceramic ash tray with the words 
"Bacino's Goat Hillton" on it, several color snapshots of him in 
his wine cellar, a bottle of his wine, and several wine labels that 
he 
designed. 
The wine 
labels 
read 
"Dago Red/Bacino's 
Goat 
Hillton/Pueblo, Colorado" and feature a photo of his parents with 
their names and dates of birth and death. 
His father was Vincenzo 
Bacino (1872-1944) and his mother was Calogera Bacino (1879-1948). 
He also gave a copy of a short article about Goat Hill (apparently 
copied from a popular history of Pueblo), and a copy of an essay 
titled "The Joy of Growing Up Italian." 
I'll note that the essay 
appears to be in wide circulation among Italian-Americans in Pueblo 
(other fieldworkers have turned up copies). 
I also sampled some of Tony's wine, which I found to be rough 
and strong. 
Some of it tasted like brandy. 
Tony walked outside with me and I took a few photos of him as 
he posed with a bottle of his "Dago Red." 
I departed at 5:10 p.m.

Informant/Event: Interview with Sollie Raso 
Coworker: 
Site: 6 
As I've noted earlier, a few days ago when Ken Light and I 
visited Undersheriff Dan Corsentino, Corsentino recommended that 
I 
interview 
Sollie 
Raso, 
chairman 
of 
the 
Pueblo 
County 
Commissioners. 
In fact, Corsentino proceeded to phone Raso and set 
up an interview for me. 
In any case, the interview was held today 
in Raso's office, from 4 p.m. until 5:20 p.m. 
I met Sollie Raso at his office at 10th and Main Streets. 
A 
powerfully built man of medium height, 
Raso is 
in his early 
sixties. 
He is a retired high school principal and football coach 
and is very well known in Pueblo. 
Corsentino told me that when 
Raso ran for office he garnered more votes than anyone else in the 
history of Pueblo politics. 
Raso is very affable and he soon put me at ease. 
I set up the 
cassette recorder, 
put a lapel mike on Raso and we began the 
interview. 
He sat beside his large, oak roll-top desk, and I sat 
in a chair opposite him. 
The beginning of the interview deals with Raso's early years. 
He grew up in Denver and went to public school and university 
there. 
He played college football, then moved to Pueblo to take 
a teaching job. 
He explained that when he and his wife were 
searching 
for 
their 
first 
home 
in 
one 
of 
Pueblo's 
newer 
neighborhoods the property owner was reluctant to sell to Raso 
because he was Italian. 
Other segments of the interview dealt with such topics as the 
role of high school athletics in mediating cultural and class 
differences, local politics, and challenges presently confronting 
the city. 
Toward the end of the interview we talked about the Italian 
Open, 
an annual golf tournament that will be held this coming 
weekend. 
Raso is one of the tournament founders. 
He told me about 
the philosophy behind the tournament and the rules by which it is 
run. 
When I asked whether there were any Italian Open caps, shirts 
or other apparel, he said he thought he said a spare Italian Open 
golf cap that he could give me. 
(I returned the following day to 
pick it up. 
It's a white golf cap with a patch that reads "Pueblo 
Italian Invitational," and has small map of Italy. 
The cap is in 
the project's collection.) 
We finished up at 5:20 since Raso was already late for supper

Informant/Event: Emma and Frank Marascola 
Coworker: Tavarelli, Paola 
Site: 6 
At 12:30 p.m. today I accompanied Paola Tavarelli to the home 
of Frank and Emma Marascola, who live at 78 Purdue Street in 
Pueblo. 
Paola previously met the Marascola's at a family reunion 
at Grace Giadone's home in Blende a couple of nights ago. 
At that 
time she had been invited to come to the Marascola's for lunch 
today. 
(As we've observed elsewhere, Paola--the girl from the old 
country--is consistently greeted with great warmth by the Italian-
Americans.) 
In any case, she asked me to tag along today to help 
out if an opportunity for an interview materialized. 
She didn't 
really know what to expect at the Marascolas, and neither did I. 
One reason for our visit was to return copies of printed dialect 
versions of common children's stories (e.g., Three Little Bears) 
rendered in broken English by a narrator whose first language is 
Italian. 
Paola had borrowed these stories from Louis Daurio, whom 
she had been at the family reunion. 
(Copies of the stories are 
included in the project's collection.) 
At any rate, what we observed when we entered the Marascola's 
home was another large family gathering that included many of the 
people Paola had met at the family reunion. 
By my count there were 
thirteen people present: Frank and Emma, including Frank's mother 
Mary Scalese, 
his daughter Julie, 
his friends Louis and Helen 
Daurio, his sister Grace Giadone, and his cousins Jim and Rose 
Russo, Frank and Louise Rocco, and Jim and Fern Rocco. 
The cousins 
are 
from 
Fresno, 
California, 
and 
Pittsburgh, 
California. 
Apparently the main reason for the cousins' visit is the annual 
Italian Open golf tournament that begins tomorrow. 
Frank is one 
of the tournament organizers. 
Some of his cousins are going to 
play in the tournament. 
Paola had met everyone before, but I felt a little out of it 
since I haven't. 
But everyone was very friendly and I was soon 
chatting with Grace Giadone and some of the California cousins. 
Meanwhile, Paola talked with Louis Daurio and was laughing heartily 
as Louis recited some of the dialect stories to her. 
Paola asked 
about the origin of the stories, but no one could say for sure. 
Frank, whose nickname is "Marscie," told her that he used to have 
copies at the liquor store he used to run and he recited the 
stories to his customers. 
As we are talking, some of the ladies were rustling up lunch 
in the kitchen. 
Soon they emerged and called everyone to a large 
table. 
There was a large hand-lettered banner hanging from the top 
of the window at the end of the table that reads: 
Emma and 
IAW-DT-F071190.A - 
2 
Marscie's Ristorante. 
We all took our seats around the table and 
began to 
dig 
into a gargantuan meal: 
dishes and dishes of 
wonderful Italian food. 
With the exception of some great small 
sausages and prosciutto, I can't remember the names of all the 
dishes. 
(Perhaps Paola was more observant.) 
The conversation around the table was very lively and there 
were many funny stories about growing up on the Mesa. 
As I 
understand it, 
all the California cousins grew up in Blende or 
Pueblo. 
Throughout the convivial meal "Marscie" was very much the 
host. 
He told a number of jokes and generally clowned around. 
At 
one point he left the room then returned wearing a cowboy hat with 
a big "L.A. Raiders" patch on the front. 
Then he told a story 
about wearing it to Mile High Stadium in Denver for a game between 
the Denver Broncos and the Raiders, and pretending he was from 
California. 
To say the least, he took a lot of abuse from Broncos' 
fans. 
Later on, Marscie left the room again and returned with the 
duds he wears at the Italian Open, including a golf cap with an 
"Pueblo Italian Open" patch, and a red, white, and green shirt with 
"Italian Open" and "Marscie" on the front. 
The meal concluded with coffee and strawberry shortcake. 
Stuffed to the gills, Paola and I departed at about 2:30.

Informant/Event: Rose & Joe Cortese (Bessemer Mercantile) 
Coworker: Tavarelli, Paola 
Site: 6 
At 2:30 this afternoon, 
I accompanied Paola Tavarelli to 
Bessemer Mercantile a s 
d at 1220 Elm 
S ree 
Pueblo. 
Paola had scheduled an 
interview with Rose 
C 
 r ese, 
a woman 
in 
her 
early 
sixties  who 
runs 
the 
small 
neighborhood store with her husband Joe. 
Mercedes Tonnes, 
a 
student from Colorado College in Colorado Springs who is a resident 
of 
Pueblo, 
also 
joined us. 
She 
is 
doing a course project 
concerning the CF & I mill and its connection to ethnicity. 
She'd 
arranged to come with us today and videotape the interview with her 
own equipment. 
Project fieldworkers Russell Frank and Ken Light have already 
visited the store (a few days ago) 
in order  to document sausage 
making, an activity that occurs regularly. 
Accordingly, Rose and 
Joe knew all about our project and we didn't have to provide the 
usual explanatory preamble to the interview. 
When Paola set up today's interview and she and Rose had 
agreed that she would interview Rose primarily, but might also 
engage Joe, as well as Rose's 95 year-old mother Marie Carmella 
Gagliano 
(who 
lives 
in a back bedroom of 
the grocery store 
building). 
Bessemer Mercantile is an old family-rim grncery store. 
It 
was formerly owned by Rose's father, Joseph Gagliano. 
(Some people 
still refer to the store by tis old nickname: 
J_oP Gag's".) 
When 
Joe married Rose he entered the family business. 
Eventually the 
old man passed the store over to Rose and Joe. 
As many people have 
told us, there used to be a lot of small neighborhood stores like 
this one around Pueblo, but few remain today. 
Bessemer Mercantile 
is well known by Pueblo residents, especially by those who grew up 
in the genera 
neigghborhood, and it is frequently described as a 
fixture of the neighborhood along with Gus's Restaurant. 
In other 
w rds, 
people 
(Italian-Americans 
in 
particular] 
have 
a very 
sitive attitude about the place as a tangible link with the 
past. 
The store looks like it hasn't changed since the day it 
opened. 
Outside, 
here's a big awning with the words "Bessemer 
Mercantile." 
Inside, the contents of the store are in one large 
rectangular room. 
There's a meat counter along the back wall, a 
cash register on a counter in the center, and floor-to-ceiling 
wooden shelves along the two side walls. 
The floor is covered with 
large black and white linoleum squares. 
Many of the products are 
IAW-DT-F071190.B - 
2 
what one would expect to find in an Italian grocery, including 
Italian meats (sausages, prosciutto , etc.) and cheeses, several 
kinds of pasta 
can 
almonds 
salted chick peas, o•3ve 
of 
an 
pizzelle irons.  
After we all trooped into the store and met Rose and Joe, Rose 
showed us into a small kitchen that we entered through a door 
behind the meat counter area. 
Joe stayed in the store to attend 
to any customers who might come in. 
Rose , a very talkative and outgoing person, immediately urged 
us to sit down , 
relax, and help ourselves to Coke and cookies she'd 
laid out for us. 
She was talking a mile a minute about herself, 
the store , her mother, the neighborhood , and Russell and Ken's 
visit the other day. 
And she wanted to know all about each of us. 
While Paola engaged her in conversation, I began to set up the tape 
recording equipment and Mercedes set up her video camera on a 
tripod . Soon, we were ready to start the interview and I indicated 
to Paola that it was alright to begin. 
And, 
since Paola had 
initiated the interview , I let her take the lead. 
Rose sat at one end of a large table and Paola sat at the 
other. 
I sat off to one side and Mercedes was about five feet 
away. 
Checking 
to 
be 
sure 
that 
the 
recording 
equipment 
was 
functioning properly , I excused myself and left the store to run 
an errand (I had to pick up video tapes that I'd had copied, and 
it was essential that I pick them up today ) 
. When I returned about 
45 minutes later , the interview was still in progress . Another 
person had joined the session : Josephine Gagliano, apparently one 
of Rose 's cousins. 
Josephine participated in the interview and I 
learned that she worked in the store on a part-time basis and found 
great enjoyment in this . I gathered that she was born in Italy. 
I believe Paula Manini has already interviewed her about her St. 
Joseph 's Day traditions . I pulled out my camera and took several 
photos of the interview session. 
Joe Cortese joined us for a few minutes and was asked a 
questions about his personal history as well as the past and 
present operation of the store. 
Joe, Rose, 
and Josephine all 
commented on the enjoyment they derive from working in the store. 
Th•ecc 
ally enjoy -talkinq 
with_custome

Rose invited each of us to meet her mother, who was reclining 
on her bed in the back bedroom . Mrs. Gagliano was very subdued 
and uncommunicative . She doesn 't speak English , so perhaps this 
is a contributing factor, but Paola, who spoke to her in Italian, 
remarked that she was very quiet and seemed not to understand her. 
Rose later told me that her mother "wasn't herself today." 
IAW-DT-F071190.B -

While Paola stayed in the kitchen talking with Rose and 
Josephine, Mercedes and I went out into the store to talk with Joe. 
Mercedes wanted to do some taping, so I asked Joe to give us a tour 
of the store and describe some of the products that he carries. 
This seemed to go well and Mercedes taped until she ran out of 
battery power. 
We finally wound things down at 5:30, but we couldn't leave 
without taking a big bag of home-made cookies and other goodies 
from Rose.

Informant/Event: Victoria Cristiano Marion 
Coworker: 
Site: 6 
This morning at about 10 a.m. I went to Victoria Marion's home 
for the purpose of 
returning photos 
and other materials 
I'd 
borrowed from her the other day in order to make copies. 
Since 
then, we'd spoken on the phone and Mrs. Marion indicated that she 
had more information to pass along to me, especially information 
about the Dante Alighieri Society. 
She seemed very concerned that 
I get enough information from her to tell the story of Pueblo's 
Italian-Americans properly. 
In any event, I arrived at her home and sat down with her at 
the dining table as before. 
I'd assumed that my visit would be a 
brief one today, 
since I mainly wanted to obtain additional 
information about the photos she'd lent me, 
but she had other 
ideas. 
As I mentioned above, she wanted to tell me more about the 
founding of the local chapter of the Dante Alighieri Society. 
Mrs. Marion explained that Father Cristoforo Tomatis, a native 
of Torino and former priest at Pueblo's Holy Family Catholic 
Church, 
had been instrumental in reviving interest in Italian 
language and culture. 
(She showed me an article about Tomatis's 
efforts in this regard that appeared in the June 29, 1978, issue 
of the Pueblo Star-Journal). 
A very charismatic person, Tomatis 
drew a large number of people to his Italian language classes. 
"His classes were crowded," Mrs. Marion recalled. 
Mrs. Marion 
assisted with the teaching of these classes. 
Local interest in learning to speak Italian led to a desire 
to acquire more books written in Italian. 
This in turn, led to 
the formation of a Pueblo chapter of the Dante Alighieri Society 
(in 1978) since the Society supports training in Italian language 
in culture through the donation of books. 
With much help from 
Father 
Tomatis, 
the 
local 
chapter 
was 
established 
and, 
subsequently, a set of Italian books was sent by the Society's 
headquarters in Rome. 
As Mrs. Marion was explaining the beginnings of the society 
chapter, 
the 
chapter's 
historian, 
Rose 
Pullaro, 
arrived. 
Apparently, Mrs. Marion has arranged for her to come by to meet me. 
The 
three 
of 
then 
looked 
through 
several 
of 
the 
chapter's 
scrapbooks as Mrs. Marion and Mrs. Pullaro described the chapter's 
activities over the years. 
The scrapbooks contained mostly color 
photos taken at chapter events, but programs and other documents 
were also included. 
Many photos depicted regular meetings as well 
as 
special events, 
such as the annual costume ball known as 
IAW-DT-F071290.A - 
2 
"carnavale," and a trip to Italy. 
They had much to show me and, 
I suppose, we looked through the scrapbooks for about an hour. 
Mrs. Pullro had to leave, but I stayed to talk with Mrs. Marion a 
while longer. 
She provided details about the photos and other items I'd 
borrowed (these are included in my photo logs). 
Presently, Mrs. Marion's husband Vincent joined us and we 
talked some about his background. 
He is from Palermo and came to 
the U.S. in the 1950s. 
As I recall, his surname was originally 
"Marioni" which he anglicized to "Marion" when moved to the States. 
When I asked about post-war emigration, they told me that 
there had been a few Italian war brides who came to Pueblo, as well 
as immigrants who came when members of their families, who were 
already living in Pueblo, 
sent for them. 
They mentioned that 
members of the Costanza and Giannetta families came during this 
period. 
The Costanzas are among the most recent immigrants. 
Since I knew Vincent had been working in his garden, I asked 
if he would show it to me. 
He seemed delighted that I'd asked, 
and he took me out back to see his small but very prosperous 
garden. 
Among the plants growing there were tomatoes, beans, 
radicchio, and artichokes. 
Vincent had just harvested his garlic 
crop and he showed me a long braid of garlic he made up. 
I asked 
Mr. and Mrs. Marion to pose for photos in the garden and I took a 
few shots of them. 
We returned to the house where Vincent pulled out a couple of 
photo books with many images of Sicily and he showed them to me 
with great pride. 
He then went into the kitchen and got a bowl of 
fried artichoke hearts and offered them to me. 
I ate a couple and 
offered him my compliments. 
Mrs. Marion told me that Vincent is 
a fine cook and often puts on demonstrations of traditional Italian 
cooking for the Dante Alighieri Society. 
Finally, after a visit of nearly three hours, I thanked the 
Marions and drove back to the hotel.

Informant/Event: Preparations for Our Lady of Mt. Carmel Festival 
Coworker: Frank, Russell 
Site: 6 
This morning I accompanied Russell Frank to Mt. Carmel Church 
(421 Clark Street, 
Pueblo) 
to take photos of Italian-American 
ladies preparing food for the annual Our Lady of Mt. 
Carmel 
Festival. 
Two days ago, Russell and Ken Light had gone down to the 
church to take photos of saints' statues and other artifacts of 
significance and had happened upon a group of ladies preparing food 
in the basement kitchen of the church. 
The ladies explained why 
they were preparing food and invited Russell and Ken to come back 
today when more activities of this kind would be taking place. 
Since Ken has finished his stint with the project and gone home, 
I came with Russell to take photos and observe the scene. 
The basement of the church is divided into two rooms: 
a large 
dining area and a kitchen. 
In the dining room a number of men and 
women of Mexican descent were preparing tortillas and menudo, and 
in the kitchen about a dozen women, most of them Italian-Americans, 
and one man (the son of one of the women) were preparing spiced 
meatballs and red sauce. 
Russell headed for the kitchen and I 
followed 
along. 
The 
ladies 
recognized 
him 
and 
called 
out 
greetings. 
Russell then introduced me. 
Most of the women were 
crowded together shoulder-to-shoulder around a large table. 
They 
were rolling hamburger meat into large meatballs and talking 
together jovially. 
A couple of others were tending two large pots 
of red tomato sauce that were on the stove. 
The work seemed to be 
going along in smooth, assembly line fashion, and it was clear that 
they'd all worked on this project in the past. 
Their output was 
very 
impressive; 
there must have been 
several 
hundred 
large 
meatballs arranged neatly on stainless steel pans. 
Russell chatted with several of the woman about what they were 
doing, and recorded some of their names. 
Among other things, they 
explained that the meatballs they're making will be sold in the 
form of meatball sandwiches during the festival. 
As Russell 
continued to interview the ladies and write notes in his reporter's 
notebook, I walked around them and took photos. 
We stayed there 
about an hour and then returned to the hotel. 
Before we left the 
ladies invited us to come back for the festival, which will begin 
on Saturday and go through Sunday. 
I said I'd try to come (Russell 
will have left town by then.) 
An interesting aspect of the congregation of Mt. Carmel Church 
is that while it was heavily Italian in the past, in recent years 
more and more members are of Mexican descent. 
As I understand it, 
this shift is due to the fact that, over the years, Italians moved 
IAW-DT-F071390.A - 
2 
to other parts of the city as they became more affluent and began 
to attend other, newer Catholic churches. 
(Mt. Carmel Church is 
located in "The Grove" neighborhood, the part of town that was 
heavily 
Italian 
before 
the 
big 
flood.) 
Mexican-Americans, 
representing Pueblo's largest and most recent wave of immigration, 
have moved into areas vacated by Italians and others, and have 
joined the congregation of Mt. Carmel. 
The melding of the old and 
new segments of congregation results in interesting negotiations 
for ethnic presentation within church activities such as the Our 
Lady of Mt. Carmel Festival: 
the Mexicans making tortillas and 
menudo in one area of the basement, 
and the Italians making 
meatballs and red sauce in another.

Informant/Event: Italian Open Golf Tournament 
Coworker: 
Site: 6 
I got up early this morning and drove out to the City Park 
Golf Course (Pueblo's municipal golf course) 
to take photos of 
activities associated with the annual Italian Open Golf Tournament, 
which begins today. 
The establishment of the tournament (which was inspired by a 
similar Italian Open in another city) is discussed in my interview 
with Sollie Raso, one of the tournament founders. 
An article in 
the local newspaper, 
the Pueblo Chieftain, provides additional 
information. 
That article is included in the project's collection. 
The tournament is seen by its organizers as a way to celebrate 
Italian ethnicity in modern and popular way: 
through friendly 
competition in a golf tournament. 
The two-day contest matches 
four-man teams (there were no women involved as far as I could 
determine) selected at random from four categories based on golfing 
skill. 
In other words, each team consists of four men with four 
different skill levels. 
The scoring is based on "best ball" play. 
The 
atmosphere 
of 
the 
tournament 
is 
one 
of 
relaxation 
and 
conviviality; good golf is valued, but fierce competition is not 
part of the scene. 
Although the majority of the golfers are of 
Italian descent, a good many are not, since the organizers do not 
wish to be exclusionary. 
Indeed, I believe one of the subtexts of 
the 
event 
is 
introducing 
non-Italians 
to 
positive 
images 
of 
Italians through interaction with Italian-Americans in a "for fun" 
contest. 
The tournament is always held over a weekend, with a big 
banquet on Saturday night. 
The Italian Open has become a very popular event in Pueblo 
and, because tournament slots are limited, people send in entry 
forms many months in advance. 
The tournament also serves to 
attract former residents of Pueblo back to the community to visit 
friends and relatives. 
Thus, family reunions are often scheduled 
to coincide with the tournament. 
For example, relatives of Frank 
"Marscie" Marascola have come from California to participate in the 
tournament and to get together with family and friends. 
At any rate, I arrived at the golf course at about 7:30, 
parked the car, and headed for the first tee with my camera gear. 
The tournament was already underway, and I saw a number of golfers 
making their way around the course. 
An announcer used a public 
address system to broadcast tee times and the names of team 
IAW-DT-F071490.A - 
2 
members. 
This was rather amusing since the announcer's many 
stumbling mispronunciations of Italian surnames indicated that he 
was not Italian himself. 
Aside from that, the litany of Italian 
names being read off every fifteen minutes or so was impressive; 
there was no doubt that this was an ITALIAN open. 
I made my way to the first tee, where I was delighted to see 
Frank "Marscie" Marascola, whom I'd met with Paola Tavarelli the 
other day. 
As one of the tournament's organizers, one of Marscie 
I s 
jobs this year is to serve as the "starter" at the first tee. 
That 
is, he collects entry fees ($10 a person) from each entrant and 
makes sure the teams tee off at the proper times until all the 
teams have started out on the course. 
(Teams began play at 6:30 
and will continue to tee off throughout the morning.) 
Marscie was sitting in a deck chair beside a patio table with 
umbrella. 
He had a list of tournament entrants and a cigar box 
for entry fees. 
Under the table he had a bottle of booze in a 
paper bag and offered nips to his friends when they came by. 
He 
was dressed in full Italian Open regalia: 
white golf shoes; green 
pants; a white, green, and red shirt with "Marscie" embroidered on 
the front; and a golf cap with the tournament logo. 
Marscie recognized me, and we chatted comfortably for a few 
minutes. 
I decided to stay with him for a while and take photos 
of players starting their rounds. 
Marscie seemed to know almost 
everyone and joked with one and all. 
Some of the men he knew 
especially well, and these he called over and introduced them to 
me. 
On a number of occasions, he asked me to take pictures of him 
with these men. 
He particularly wanted me to meet some of the 
tournament organizers he has worked with. 
Among others, 
he 
introduced me to John Califano (vice president of the Pueblo City 
Council) 
and Johnny Johnson 
(one 
of the tournament committee 
members). 
Some of his relatives came by (the men from California 
I'd met with Paola) and they all remembered me. 
I hung out with Marscie for over an hour and, in addition to 
taking photos of Marscie and his pals, I took a few shots of men 
teeing off, and shots of golf bags with the "Pueblo Italian Open" 
logo. 
I then walked over to another tee to check out the action. 
There I spotted Sollie Raso and went over to say "hello" and thank 
him for the golf cap he'd given me. 
He introduced me to his 
playing partners. 
At about 10 a.m. , 
having seen about all there was to see short 
of walking the course with one of the foursomes, I left the golf 
course and drove back to the hotel.

Informant/Event: Our Lady of Mt. Carmel Festival 
Coworker: 
Site: 6 
This afternoon, after returning videos tapes to Esther Thomas 
that Paola Tavarelli had borrowed, I drove to Mt. Carmel Church, 
at 421 Clark Street, in order to investigate the annual Our Lady 
of Mt. Carmel Festival. 
I especially wanted to see the ladies 
Russell and I had met yesterday as they prepared meatballs and red 
sauce that they would be selling at the festival. 
I'd been told that the festival wouldn't official begin until 
after afternoon mass today (which will end around 3 p.m.). 
I'd 
also been told that the festival is very popular and attracts large 
crowds. 
Accordingly, I drove to the church a little early--the 
time was about 2:30--in order to find a parking space. 
Mass was 
still in session at the church, so I walked around the small space 
used for the outdoor festival. 
The space used was a parking lot 
on the corner directly across from the church. 
A number of booths, 
most with tent-like roofs overhead, were set up there. 
These 
booths consisted of food and drink concessions, games of chance, 
and sales areas for hand-made craft items and religious artifacts. 
A low plywood stage was in one corner of the area, and a sound 
system was being set up when I arrived. 
The majority of the people 
in attendance--those who manned the booths as well as festival 
visitors--were Hispanic. 
One large concession area that sold 
tacos, tortillas and other Mexican foods was adorned with a big 
banner that said "Our Lady of Mt. Carmel" in Spanish. 
I spotted some of the ladies I'd met yesterday at their sales 
area. 
They were getting ready to open and were preparing the 
ingredients for the meatball sandwiches they were going to sell 
(Italian cookies, soft drinks and burgers were also available). 
I took a few pictures of them, but the lighting was rather poor 
since they were under a dark blue tent that filtered out a lot of 
light. 
I then walked up to the church and went in to observe the last 
20 minutes of the Mass. 
The church was packed with people and I 
stood near the back of the church. 
Eventually, the service ended 
and people (included a fair number of children) streamed out of the 
church and went across the street to the festival site. 
Most 
headed for the various food concessions. 
At about this time, other 
people from the community began to arrive. 
I walked around and took a few more photos, then bought a 
meatball sandwich from the Italian ladies and sat down and down to 
eat it. 
Next, I took a few more photos and briefly spoke to the 
IAW-DT-F071490.B - 
2 
Italian ladies 
at their booth. 
They were getting a lot 
of 
customers for their sandwiches and couldn't spare more than a 
moment or two to speak with me. 
At about 5 p.m. I packed up my 
cameras and left. 
My guess is that there were about 300 people at 
the festival site. 
The festival will continue tomorrow and will include a saints 
procession. 
Unfortunately, I'll have to miss it since I'm leaving 
Pueblo tomorrow and heading back to Washington.
