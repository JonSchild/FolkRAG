ROOKERIES 
 
All men knew a secret of the northern part  
of an old world, a less perfect 
 
idea. For the bicornuate woman,  
it is an island. If there, the birds  
 
lose our trust, we might learn  
 
their language. After all, we have  
been taught  
to read and write,  
 
to remove our hands  
from other work  
as we watch water twist into rock: 
 
to cover our wounds, 
staying alive light after light. 
 
For something, I worry.  
The moon pronounced with clarity  
 
its known topography. Our letters  
and lists, reconstructed grammars:  
 
they replace the ways in which we were  
grabbed, then pushed and shoved.  
 
A fine wife and her children 
set to rove with indefinite orders:  
 
lineal migration on a small scale, 
a purpose was not nautical, 
 
but conflictual. Of those men,  
 
we knew I could never do  
them any good. In this way 
 
I forget, and let the wind 
(river). It gales and tears  
at my shoulders and wrists.
