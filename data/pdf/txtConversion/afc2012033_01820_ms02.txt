JB: This is Jill Breit speaking and today is Monday March 18, 2013 and I’m at the Stauffer, is that how you 
say your name? 
BS: Stauffer. 
JB: Stauffer is how you say your last name. I’m at the Stauffer farm in North Lawrence and I am here to 
interview Ben about his family farm and that is for the Archie Green Dairy Farm Project. So Ben could 
you just start by telling me a little bit about the history of the farm here. 
BS: Okay. My father started the farm in 1977. He started with 60 cows. It was not at this side, it was 
around the corner at another farm site. I started with 60 cows in 1985. There was a barn fire, the barn 
burned down and he built for a 100 cows after he had the barn fire, so he expanded by 40 cows then. In 
1995 we decided to have an expansion to 300 cows. That involved staying at the same site but building a 
free stall barn behind and adding on that many cows. All the while as we are building for more cows, 
we’re buying more farms that come up for sale around here, you know there is a lot of farms going out 
of business during that time. So we bought some of the neighbors’ farms that went out of business and 
got to 300 cows in 1995 and I believe in 2002 we made an agreement to buy another 300 cow farm, so 
we doubled in size just by buying from a guy that wanted to retire from the dairy farming business. We 
bought his farm and all the land and the cows and you know all that came along with that. So we were 
at 600 cows in 2002, and 2010 we put the 2 herds together at this farm here and expanded to 1300 
cows at the time. So we brought them all together here and in 2011, the next year, we added another 
200 cows to get to 1500 to get to where we are now. We milk the cows; we take care of the cows, the 
milking and feeding them. We also grow all the crops for forage that we feed the cows. We don’t grow a 
lot of our own grain. We do a little bit of corn for grain to try to reduce feed costs, but most of the work 
we do is associated with taking care of the cows and making sure there is enough feed for the cows and 
making sure that we are doing a good job with what we do. We place a high priority on the high quality 
milk. We bed our cows with sand so the cows really like that. It is really comfortable, but also it’s 
inorganic so the bacterium doesn’t grow in the sand beds and you have less mastitis in your cows and 
higher quality milk because of that. So we do our best to take care of our cows, take care of our 
employees and take care of the land that we farm, too.

JB: Do you anticipate that 1500 is about how big it will get or do you have plans to make it even bigger? 
BS: We don’t have plans currently to make it any bigger. We are not going to rule out that possibility 
though. 
(0:03:40) 
JB: Describe the way the farm developed. It almost seems like your essentially consolidated what a 
number of other farmers were doing in the area and brought it under the umbrella of your family farm. 
BS: It was either sees those farms grow up in brush or use them ourselves. We were in a position where 
we could use the land to feed more cows, so we did. A lot of the farmers were more of the retirement 
age that went out of business, but some of them weren’t. Some of them were well within their working 
years. We definitely bought up the land that came available though. 
(0:04:24) 
JB: How many acres is the farm 
BS: We farm; it is 2700 acres tillable, so that is not all owned, we rent about 800 of that probably. We 
own about 1900 acres ourselves. It’s about 1700 acres of corn and 1000 acres of hay total. 
(0:04:44) 
JB: What about woodlots? 
BS: Woodlots, I don’t have a real good number on that, I would say it’s at least 500 acres of woodlots. It 
could be 6 or 700; I don’t have real good hand on that right now. 
(0:05:00) 
JB: How many family members work the farm? 
BS: Working, it’s my mom and dad, my brother and I, and my wife does the books here at the farm. My 
brother’s wife doesn’t really do any real steady work on the farm. She’ll help out occasionally. 
(0:05:22) 
JB: Your dad is Sandy is that correct? 
BS: Yes, Sanford, but he goes by Sandy because people can’t pronounce his name. 
JB: And your mother’s name is? 
BS: Ruth. My wife’s name is Karen and my brother’s name is Aaron and his wife is Renee. 
JB: Do you have children who are working here with you’re too?

BS: No. My kids are 2 years old and a new born and my brother’s kids are I believe his older daughter is 
10 or 11 and his other kids are 7 and 3 I think. 
(0:06:00) 
JB: How many other employees do you have? 
BS: Full time is probably about 20 others and there are some part timers, especially in the summer. 
There are 5 or 6 truck drivers we get to help out, too. 
(0:06:18) 
JB: On the farms we have visited so far there has been a mix of the labor force; some farms are only 
working with North Country residents, some are working the migrants working, some are working with 
Amish farmers, what is the mix on your farm? 
BS: I don’t know if that is something I really want to talk about I guess. We have a really good work force 
and everybody works hard on it. I rather not go into detail about where they come from and where they 
are. 
(0:06:56) 
JB: Knowing that I only have a little bit of time to talk to you today, I guess I will get right to the point 
and say, a lot of people think that dairy farming is declining and not a good way to make a living, and yet 
your family has consistently grown and invested more in. So what is your answer to people who say you 
can’t make a living dairy farming? 
BS: It’s definitely a changing business, if you are not willing to change how you do things, it’s not for you. 
Definitely we make a good living doing this and at the size we are now, it’s not the hard living that it 
used to be at 60, 100 cows that Dad used to have. I think it is a great way to make a living and I am really 
excited about the future of it. I’m happy to be doing what I am doing and I would encourage people to 
get into the business, but you have to have the right mindset, too. You have to do things right to make it 
a viable way of business. You can’t just go into it halfway. 
(0:08:04) 
JB: So tell me about some of that. What do you think are some of the keys that have made your family 
successful and do it right? 
BS: Well, you have to evaluate all the sales people that come on the farm. You have to evaluate is this 
product or machine really going to be profitable, or is it just going to be something that I end up 
spending a lot of money on and then it doesn’t really improve the bottom line. When we looked at 
setting up this operation here, we looked at ways we could be labor efficient, but also take care of the 
cows in a way that the cows are very comfortable out there in the sand beds. Take care of your 
employees, make their work fairly easy because if it’s not easy or at least reasonably easy, the guys are 
not going to do it right; you have to make it pretty much fool proof if you want things to get done right.

You have to have a good system, that’s what we found. When we designed the milking parlor here, we 
looked for ways to improve the efficiency of cow flow and ways to reduce labor there. There is a lot of 
automation, but there are things that we didn’t go to the highest extreme of automation either because 
if you get into some of that, the pay back for each incremental improvement in technology tends to get 
less and less as you go for more and more. It’s complicated to keep all this stuff running, too.  We have a 
nice set up, but sometimes you can’t keep the computer programs working right to get all the data out 
that you want and then you are on the phone with people in Wisconsin with Bomatic and you are back 
and forth trying to make sure things work, and it would be so much worse if we went to that upper level 
of automation. Things are efficient, but they are fairly simple. Another thing that really made us pretty 
successful at this stage is we had all the old barns that we were milking cows in, well the 2 main ones 
and a few smaller heifer barns. So when we moved here we were able to convert those fairly cheaply 
into heifer raising barns, so we didn’t have to go out and spend all the money to build a facility here and 
then also for heifers. It’s not like we just started up from nothing. Here we did, and that was good 
because we could do everything in a system that would work, but the other places we were able to 
retrofit the barns and save quite a bit of money. 
(0:11:00) 
JB: Are the farms that you have put together of the years contiguous or in different locations. 
BS: There are some that are contiguous. We were actually able to put across the road here from the 
main farm we were able to put some farms together. It is at least 5 farms together to make one big 
block, its 500 acres in one field now, so we are really proud of that. We are trying to drain it and improve 
that land you know because it is right across the road; it’s the perfect spot for us. Then there are some 
farms. There is a farm off 5 miles away and we don’t own any land around it, but we own that farm you 
know. 
 (0:11:52) 
JB: With all these new systems, is your job mostly now management? 
BS: It is a lot more management. The phone is ringing a fair bit. 
JB: You were on the phone when I walked in. 
BS: I was on the phone when you walked in. Another guy called me since you’ve been sitting here. It’s a 
lot management. I still as a manager I like to get involved in the nitty-gritty of the work, too. In between 
going and helping people that I am managing today, I am trying to work on a frame of a truck to mount a 
fork lift on. So I’m welding it and doing all the basic things, too, but I’m also trying to keep everybody 
moving in the right direction, too. It can be a frustrating day when people keep calling you in the middle 
of a project, but you end up getting more done. You have people working for you. I don’t like to put my 
employees in a position where I’m not willing to do a job that I’m making them do. It probably won’t 
happen anymore today, but later on there is a plugged manure pipe that I have to go work on. You can 
imagine it gets to be not a very rosy smelling day when you are doing that.

(0:13:20) 
JB: So do you work 7 days a week on the farm? 
BS: I don’t really work 7 days a week, I work 6 days a week and take most of Sunday off. I do come out 
and check the barns on Sunday, make sure everything is going okay, but it’s about an hour usually on 
Sunday. 
(0:13:37) 
JB: What are the roles of your family members on the farm, like your dad? 
BS: That’s kind of hard with Dad. He does what he wants, when he wants, but he will also come around 
asking Aaron or I about what he wants us to do, or what we want him to do. He’ll come around, “What 
do you want me to do today?” Sometimes I will have something for him and other times he will say, “If 
you don’t have anything for me I’m going to go do this.” He does what he wants, but he is definitely very 
helpful to have around and he takes care of a lot of details that other people wouldn’t. He has stepped 
back from management mostly. He’ll give us direction when he thinks we need it, my brother and me, 
Aaron and me. I don’t think he thinks we need it very often. If we have a question or something, we 
bounce it off of him. My mom had been doing the books; she had done the books up until a few years 
ago when my wife Karen took it over. Now she takes care of our kids while my wife is doing the books. 
She helps out with some of the tax forms at the end of the year because she is still move familiar with 
the end of the year process because it’s quite a lot of paperwork to deal with all the employee papers 
and all that, especially for taxes. That is Mom’s responsibilities. My brother Aaron is more the herd’s 
person. He keeps track of the cows and he is very involved with all of that. I would say he has a better 
handle on the business numbers then I do, so when the bankers comes to have our yearly meeting, he’ll 
talk a lot to him and I’ll just add a few things here and there. He is kind of the business manager and 
herd’s person and I do the field work. I manage the guys that are doing the field work and take care of 
equipment in the barn, too. If there is any barn equipment that breaks down, that is usually my 
responsibility to fix if I can fix it myself.  My wife Karen as I mentioned before does the books. It is 2 half 
days a week in general that she spends doing that, so it is not really that much. 
(0:16:14) 
JB: Do you think that it’s necessary for a farm operation to be successful for it to really be a family 
project, is that a critical piece? 
BS: I’m not sure if I could go at it alone with my wife and have a successful farm. I really enjoy the family 
aspect of it. I think it is possible for certain people. I think my brother could make it work as just a 
manager and having employees under him, but we complement each other very well. I often say, my 
brother and I are 2 years apart, he is 2 years older. We grew up together and we had all these chores we 
had to do as kids. We would sometimes sit around and debate for an hour or 2 on who did what before 
we actually got to do the work, which was usually only half an hour. I like to say we got our differences 
hammered out and learned to work together as we were kids. Now we work together really well.

JB: That’s great. Did you spend a lot of time in the barn with the cows when you were a kid? 
BS: Yes, I don’t remember what age I started having chores so to speak, but it was definitely from 12 
years old or more and I had set chores that I had to do every day and it was anywhere from half an hour 
to an hour, maybe 2 hours as soon as I got older. It wasn’t optional, it was chores, and we had to do it. I 
had a sense of ownership even then that I wanted to contribute to the family business and I really 
enjoyed it. There was never any pressure from Dad or Mom to come back to the farm. They always said 
go do what you want to do. If you want to come back to the farm we hope it’s something that you can 
make work, it was never any push like that. They definitely didn’t discourage it, but they didn’t say 
whether or not they wanted us to come back either. 
(0:18:26) 
JB: So you left to go to college? 
BS: I grew up here on the farm and after high school I went to college in Virginia to Eastern Mennonite 
University, and that was a 4 year degree in business and economics, I double majored in those two. 
After that for 3 years I worked in Brazil with the Mennonite Central Committee, it’s a mission’s 
organization. I was building water cisterns to catch rainwater there. It was a really really good 
experience and really shaped the person I am today. I met my wife there actually, too. She’s Canadian. 
She was doing a 1 year term there and that is how we got together, so worth it in many ways for me. 
(0:19:21) 
JB: Then you decided you would come home? 
BS: Then I decided after that I would come home. My wife and I weren’t really dating when I got done 
with my term in Brazil. When she came home we started dating and it wasn’t until we decided to get 
married and that we wanted to settle down together here that we will get into ownership here on the 
farm. That was 2006 I believe that I decided to get into ownership here. 
(0:19:55) 
JB: Is your brother’s story a similar story? 
BS: He went to college, he came back. He was dating his wife all through college and they got married 
after college and decided to come back right away after college. That was in 1999, I guess. He’s been 
here 6 or 7 years more than I have.  
(0:20:22) 
JB: As far as the household economies here, nobody has a job off the farm? 
BS: None of our family has a job off the farm. My wife actually, until we had our kid, worked off the farm 
as a school teacher. Since having the kids she doesn’t want to go back when they are young anyways.

JB: I promised you I would let you go at 2:30, let me ask you this today, what kind of work is going on 
right now, the end of March getting into April? 
BS: Obviously the milking goes on all the time. That is almost 24 hours a day we milk here. Feeding has 
to get down every day. Right now as far as the fields go, we are taking care of equipment and trying to 
get things maintained and ready to go. As an owner-manager I’ve been going around and buying some 
equipment that we are going to need for this year. I think I got just about everything on the list now. The 
capital purchases are mostly done for this year, for the equipment side anyways. 
JB: Is that every year? 
BS: Every year I try to get things because I am more free in the winter to be able to do that. I’ll go out to 
Ohio or Michigan or somewhere looking at tractors and equipment. I like to get stuff slightly used. You 
can save some money by doing it that way. Today we are spreading manure because it is good weather, 
frozen ground to get out and spread manure, so they are hauling manure today and just getting ready 
for spring. Last year this time the ground was thawed and I think we were picking stones almost this 
time. I had all my seeding in by the end of March last year, but it doesn’t look like it’s going to happen 
this year. 
(0:22:26) 
JB: You have so many acres; do you actually go through and pick stones out of all of those acres? 
BS: Not all of them need to be picked usually, but all of the seeding acres do. All of the hay seeding we 
hand pick and the bigger rocks we pick with the skid steer or loader. All those acres have to be picked. I 
seed about 300 areas a year. But the corn acres, most fields do need picking, but that consists of driving 
a skid steer back and forth and picking off the big ones. There is not a whole crew of guys going out by 
hand. Not doing it the hold fashion way of the horse with a sled behind it tossing the rocks. 
JB: That would be the whole year. 
BS: For 2700 acres, for sure. When I get one picking stones in the spring, for the 300 acres I usually have 
2 crews of 4 or 5 guys and find what every neighbor kids I can find and out we go. 
(0:23:30) 
JB: Is there anything else you want to say today before I turn off the tape recorder? 
BS: I guess not really, no. You already touched on most of the things. I’m not really sure what you are 
interested knowing. I want to reiterate that I am excited about it and I love doing it and I’m excited 
about this new year of planting and hoping to improve the crops the way they are and hopefully we get 
a little bit more rain than we did last year and so I’m really excited.

JB: The larger the farm, the more reluctant they are to talk to us and I think it is because they feel like 
people are critical of them somehow, do you think that is why that is? Really small farms are the ones 
that are most eager to talk to us, the bigger the farm gets the less they want to talk to us. 
BS: Our neighbors are great and we don’t have any problems with any of our neighbors. We get along 
really well. WE have a great relationship with the community here. I don’t really have any problem 
talking about our farm to you at all, but there has been a perception of large farms, that the larger you 
are, the more people look at you and the more of a target you might be if someone wanted to accuse 
you of doing something wrong. It’s like you are the big guy on the block I guess. Maybe it’s because you 
have more to lose. If someone were to accuse you of doing something wrong or say mistreating and 
animal or polluting the environment, you have a lot to lose. IF you got a guy with 30 cows or something 
and somebody comes and says you spread the manure too near the ditch and it is running of, he is 
basically immune by the law. That size farmer doesn’t even fall under the category of the DEC being able 
to regulate them. 
JB: So you actually live with a different level of scrutiny and regulations than somebody with a much 
smaller farm. What is the cutoff point where you have enough cows that you are treated like big 
business? 
BS: Its either 200 or 300. There was some sort of letter put out recently from the governor saying that 
they were going to raise that from 200 to 300 to encourage milk production in the state. That is not 
really going to do anything; we are way over that anyways. We are a Concentrated Animal Feeding 
Operation, CAFO farm, so we follow a lot of regulations. This whole facility was designed by an engineer, 
the waste water, the storm water and run off and everything has to be kept separate from waste 
manure. All the manure storage is inspected and approved by engineers. The manure pits that are out 
back, they are lined with 2 feet of clay that was approved. The permeability index of that clay is that it 
just doesn’t go through it. It is designed and tested. A smaller farm under that level doesn’t have to 
worry about that stuff. I will often see, you drive by a smaller farm, and no they are not doing it quite 
the right way, but I’m not going to turn anybody in, but it’s definitely they are playing by a different set 
of rules, which is fine. They have done it that way forever and everyone is still getting along, but they are 
not as efficient. It is being unwilling to change or unable to change I guess. 
(0:28:00) 
 
JB: It isn’t enough to just love the animals; you have to be a good business person. 
BS: Loving the animals is a big part of it, but there a lot of people that love the animals and don’t have a 
handle on the numbers at all; a lot of them that I am still trying to buy their land from and I can’t talk 
business sense with them. Its well, I might need it for getting back into farming at sometime, which is 
fine if they want to try to get back into farming that is great, but sometimes I look at it and say that is a 
long way from happening. To be at a size where they can be efficient, it is a long way from happening.

JB: do you feel like they are being impractical? 
BS: I kind of feel like they are being impractical, definitely. But hey, it’s their land and their decision to 
make, which is fine. I hope it remains their decision to make. A lot of land we’ve gotten has either been 
through a farm actually going broke and being forced into that situation. You really hate to see it when it 
goes that way. Especially if it is something that somebody has worked their whole life on. I hate to see it 
when it goes that way; some people don’t know when to pull the plug on it. 
JB: Thank you Ben, I appreciate you taking the time to talk to me today. 
BS: No problem, thank you.
