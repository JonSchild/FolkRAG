LIFT UP A 
MAN WHEN HE'S DOWN. 
As sung by FRANK LEWIS. 
WHAT legions of friends always bless 
When golden success gilds our way, 
How they smile as they softly address its, 
So cordial, good humored and gay. 
But oh if the sun of prosperity 
Has set, then how quickly they frown, 
And cry out in tones of severity, 
Kick the man don't you see that he's down. 
CitoRus. 
Then let all your dealings be honest and true. 
And do unto others as you'd have them to do, 
Sickness and sorrow may yet come to you, 
So lift up a 
man when he's down. 
What then if you had not a 
sorrow, 
Your heart was as open as day, 
Your friends when they wanted to borrow. 
You'd oblige and ricer ask them to pay, 
But when if a 
friend you ne'er slighted, 
You wander about through the town, 
This friend becomes very near sighted, 
And don't seem to know you when down. 
Then let all, .te. 
Then give me the heart that forever, 
Is free from the worlds selfish rust, 
And the man whose high noble endeavor, 
Is to raise fallen men ± om the dust, 
And when in adversity's ocean, 
A victim is likely to drown, 
All hail to the man whose devotion, 
Will lift up this new when I

cnte day I 
took a 
walk. rambling thro the Central Park. 
It was at the close of a 
bright Autumn day, 
To enjoy the evening: breeze as it -,
.\\-ift sped thro the trees. 
And watch the fountain's water brightly play. 
After walking once around, a 
rustic bench I 
found, 
And sitting down a 
moment just to rest. 
When a 
voice I 
lie,ird a1s ye. saying"• Soon to you Iii prove 
unit honesty of purpose is the best. -
As I 
looked up with s.Irprise. a 
strange sight met my eyes. 
Some fifty sparrows trathered o'er my head: 
A big cock sparrow sp..ke. with age his feathers brok e, 
And this was Vhat the old cook ,: parrow said.

And I 
hope that in confinement he'll not stay.

He took it from the rich to 4ive the poor! 
I'd rather run the risk. be ruled by men like him and Fisk, 
For then no beggars hungered at your door. 
Of such things soon we'll tire, look at the great Brooklyn fire; 
They condemned the theatres—when the folks were dead! 
Had they done it but before. we should not the fire deplore"— 
This was part of what the old cock sparrow said. 
•• In the election long since gone, none knows which man has 
Won. 
They did the 
counting' just themselves to please: 
Let Returning Boards act fair, and do things on the square, 
And we care not if it's Tilden or it's Hayes. 
But one thing 'we must see, in this land so great and free. 
That work in plenty shall be got for all: 
And the scoundrels who would lower the wages of the poor, 
How quickly we will send them to the wall!" 
At this a 
shout did rise, which ascended to the skies, 
From the sparrows that did dutter o'er my head; 
They said his word , were right, as they flew into th4 night, 
And they voted all the old cock sparrow said.

SOMETHING THAT OUGHT TO BE DONE. 
Motto Song. 
Sung by FRANK LEWIS with great success. 
This world is advancing each moment and hour, 
And startling improvements are made, 
Each nation is striving to gain greater power, 
All others to throw in the shade. 
And each individual struggles along, 
For he knows that when life is begun, 
To gain great distinction, he really must try 
To do something that's never been done. 
This city has many attractions, I 
own, 
But still there is something amiss, 
The streets and the parks should be kept neat and clean, 
My idea for improvement is this. 
There are plenty of good honest men out of work, 
With hunger and debt overrun, 
They are willing to toil, let us give them the chance, 
It is something that ought to be done. 
Our country is burdened with debt and distress, 
Its people are suffering, too. 
Our finances are in a 
terrible mess, 
And the prospect at present looks blue. 
- 
There is only one way to prosperity now, 
For corruption has had a 
long run, 
We should have the right man at the head of our land, 
It is something that ought to be done. 
Frank Lewis's Great Local Statue Song. 
As sung by him it the different Theatres with success. 
WE are erecting many statues to great people in our land, 
And well I 
love to honor them, a 
noble gallant band. 
In Union Square stands Washington, the chief who made ow: 
name, 
And honest Abraham Lincoln, almost of an equal fame. 
And in the centre Lafayette beholds the noble work, 
And fifty others proudly stand, in the City of New York. 
So I 
myself have made a 
list of men who fame have won, 
That should have statues made for them, for things which they 
have done. 
So now I'll open out my list, and tell you in my song, 
The position that each statue holds, as best to him belongs. 
I'd have Belknap cheating soldiers out of rations every day, 
And Mr. Schenck slipping the cut, when poker he did play. 
I'd have a 
crucible fast tied on the back of Oakey Hall, 
And Grant a 
smoking a 
cheap segar, with two bull- dogs great 
and small. 
I'd have Harriet Beecher Stowe, fast tied on the back of Byron' 
Ghost, 
And Sankey's hundred sheep, served up in one big mutton roast. 
I'd have an Alderman in great surprise, putting on a 
nice clean 
shirt, 
A Policeman seeking danger, where there's no chance to be hurt. 
A 
Ballet Girl with nothing on, whirling round upon her toes, 
Each Politician safe in jail, playing chequers with his nose. 
I'd have Peter Cooper's Greenbacks, spread around like the 
Suns' ray 
And every workingman should earn, lot: of them every day. 
I'd have Ben. Butler with his larboard cyc, out upon a 
tare, 
And Hues as he took his seat, in the Presidential chair.

GOD BLESS OUR DEAR OLD FLAG. 
Dedicated to my esteemed friend Miss C. E. 
DE 
SIIEPPARD. 
with best wishes. 
Original song, as sung by FRANK LEWIS, at 
the New National Theatre, Philadelphia. 
IN this glorious land of freedom, exciting times have been, 
I 
often picture in my mind, each great and stirring scene. 
I 
never looked upon the place, where our starry flag did fly, 
But the great events of by-gone days, to picture them id try. 
'Twas a 
noble sight at Yorktown, when Washington did stand, 
And took the sword from that great lord, who did invade our 
native land. 
He tried his best to win the tight, and low our banner drag. 
But the Yankee boys rose in their might, and saved our dear 
old flag. 
Again when shot and shell they flew, like hailstones tluck and 
fast, 
A 
gallant youth he braved them all,. as lie clung to the mast. 
He seized our country's emblem, which had been shot away, 
And waved it in the foeman's face, way down in Mobile bay, 
A Yankee cheer it then went up, in triumph from our fleet, 
And soon the enemy gave way, defeated, cowed and beat, 
The boy descended to the deck. of Parragut we brag, 
And every brave tar with joy cried out, •' God bless our dear 
own old flag." 
Again when trouble came us o'er, and darkest was the hem.. 
A noble general staunch and brave, he proved his mighty power. 
He stood upon the battle plain, as thousands did him fight. 
His emblem was our Stars and Stripes Ids motto " Truth and 
Right." 
Though treated bad by friemrs at home, he scorned the fight to 
yield, 
He swore he'd win the victory, or perish on the field. 
He led his columns manfully, repelled each tierce attack. 
The battle was Antietam boys. the hero, Little Mae. 
And when the great Centennial came, each nation in this world. 
Did bless our glittering emblem, when its Inintiir/r was -
trikfurDi. 
They came from Asia's sandy plains, from Africa burnin!-, 
clime, 
From far Australia's lonely wilds, from Europe's sunny Rhine. 
They came to see the poor man's home. where the Sun sinks in 
the West, 
Where every wanderer finds a 
bed, and is with plenty blest. 
And when our banner bright went up, no tyrants flaunting rag, 
The nations all with joy they cried, God bless that dear old flag!

WE WANT A 
PRESIDENT, 
As sung by FRANK. LEWIS, throughout the Country during 
the late exciting election. 
EXCITEMENT now is all the rage in these United States, 
The people want to know who'll be the lucky candidates. 
Now I 
show ill t 
partiality, while my rhymes I 
do present, 
But I 
hope we'll get an honest man for our next President. 
We want no present- taking man, who thinks of naught but gain 
We want a 
roan who'll bring us back, the good old- times again. 
When peace and plenty rules the land, and funds more rightly 
spent, 
We want a 
man like honest Abe, for our next, President. 
tfur Country is a 
gliirieus ( ate, the finest on the earth, 
We've just passed the Centennial of this great nation's birth. 
As marksmen we were champions, last September at Creedmoor 
But to a 
take ,ur rulers we must show a 
clearer score. 
We want no men in () Mee who will violate their trust. 
By shielding, '• Crooked Whiskey Rings, - 
or doing things unjust 
We care not for their polities, if they're on honest purpose bent, 
We 'Want a true and worthy statesman, for our next President. 
We want Jo, 
who try to make of politics a 
trade, 
And tried to throw our honest mune forever in the shade. 
We've had enough of Useless Grant, and his relations too, 
We want a 
man who'll keep his oath and the constitution too. 
We do not NVallt. a 
wooden man, WO do not want a 
fool, 
We want a 
man with :N-)ninton sense, who can't be made a 
tool. 
We want a 
man like Washington, who never stole a 
cent, 
Ane. ;hen this Country will be blest with an honczt President.

IT IS SUE TO PAY IN THE END. 
Orig,nal Motto Song, Sung by FRANK LEWIS. 
Adelphi Theatre, Buffalo, N. V. 
SOME hundreds of mottoes to you have been sung, 
But this I 
can greatly defend, 
it teaches you all to act upright and square, 
It is sure to pay in the end. 
Wherever your pathway may lead you through life, 
Unto this great maxim attend, 
Do unto others as you would be done by, 
And it is sure to pay in the end. 
CHORUS. 
I'll stand by my motto, while life it shall last, 
And the true workingman re defend, 
Stand firm by the Anvil, the Axmand the Plough, 
It is sure to pay in the end. 
Let the nobleman boas l 
of his wealth and his name, 
Of the honor'.. his ancestors won, 
Let the general who gains, on thc battle-field fame, 
Proclaim thc great deeds he has done, 
Let the miser count over his thousands in gold, 
To th3 dollars he': saved close attend, 
I 
would rather thc workingman' z 
blessing secure, 
is sure to pay in the end. 
Our great politicians, the people do cheat, 
Our congressmen, draw their back pay, 
Wnen their pockets are full, and they get all they can, 
erom the country they quickly away. 
But the laboring man is our safeguard and hope, 
The nation must on him depend, 
Though his troubles are great, anti his life it is hard, 
It is sure. to pay in the ena. 
I'll stand by my, 8:c. 
, 
The men who wear broad-cloth, and in diamonds do shine, 
And at poverty they look with scorn, 
They had better the wages of fraud decline, 
Or better by far ne'er been born. 
'Tis better the dry loaf of honesty eat, 
When a 
dollar well earned you can spend, 
Live truthful and honest, and you will find at last, 
It is sure to pay in the end. 
I'll stand by my, &c.

Give Me the Man with an Honest Heart. 
An origninal song. sting 
by FRANK LEWIS, at the Theatre 
Comique, St. I.4-ntis. .Mo.. with rounds of applimse. 
In the century now gtall', there has heel' many battles Iron 
And upon this subject I 
will take my text; 
From things that are absurd, this idea to me ol.eurred— 
T 
wonder what they're going to do next? 
When this world it first began, Father Adam was the man, 
Ile lived alone— which made him much perplexed: 
So a 
rib he gave away, a 
nice wife to make, they say. 
I 
wonder what they're going to do next ? 
Mr. Moody lost a 
sheep when the shepherd was asleep, 
And Sankey counted onlrninety-nine ; 
Anna Dickinson wrote a 
play on the topics of the day, 
Cordon Bennett's roaming in a 
foreign elime. 
The ladies in our land, -they have formed a 
temperance band. 
But their husbands only stronger cocktails mixed; 
Theodore Tilton, it is said, has been gel ting. in the wrong bed. 
wonder what he's going 14, do next ? 
They've made a 
saint of Brigham Voting, so many babes to him 
belong, 
Sent Quakers to tight the Indian foe; 
They let Custer lose his life, in the battle's deadly strife. 
Because they had no soldiers there to go. 
They have lowered the poor man's pay—he but a 
dollar gets 
a 
day! 
While the heads of each department are well fixed; 
When their swindles are found out, they laugh at us and shout, 
I 
wonder what they're going to do next? 
As snug by FRANK LEms. 
Give me the man with an honest heart, 
I 
care not what he be, 
He may be rich, he may be poor, 
It matters not to me: 
He may not wear a 
silken vest. 
Or boast of high degree, 
But if he owns an honest heart, 
His nature's all to me. 
All praise then be to him 
Who acts a 
noble part, 
For a 
right good man is he, 
Who owns an honest heart. 
What if a 
man can learning boast, 
And wealth of golden ore, 
Yet, if he lacks an honest heart, 
I 
call him still but poor ; 
Speak not to me of wealth and rank. 
They are bubbles on the sea, 
And man may dwell in gilded halls. 
But may not honest he. 
All praise then, etc. 
Now if he owns an honest heart. 
So gentle, true and kind, 
We need not search the wide world o'er, 
A better man to find. 
Then give to every man his due, 
Who acts an honest plan, 
It is the heart and not the coat 
That makes the honest man. 
All praise then, etc. 
Respectfully dedicated to Mr. W. IL MORTON, 
Theatre Comique, Washington, D. C. 
A 
companion song to the Minstrel Band,. an original song, 
as sung by FRANK LEWIS, 
at the Howard Athenmum, Boston, Mass. 
I 
HAVE sung of the minstrels who have all passed away, 
Whose names I 
love to recall, 
Of Bryant, Seymour and Unsworth, 
And Epb. Horn, the last of them all. 
But now as a 
token of sorrow I'll sing, 
Of our actors and actresses that are fled, 
Of the bright mimic heroes who have stood on these boards, 
But whose memorY shall never be dead. 
CHORUS. 
Then success to the stage, and the people who win, 
Upon it a 
record and name, 
Who gain for themselves while our memory shall last, 
A 
seat in the temple of fame. 
There's an actress now gone to the land of the blest, 
The foot-lights will see her no more, 
As a 
true artist, she well stood the test, 
But the day of her triumph is o'er. 
Meg Merrilles now is a 
thing of the past, 
For the queen of the stage, she is gone, 
And none is left to wear the gold crown, 
Charlotte Cushman so often has worn. 
There's America's tragedian, who so nobly has worked, 
To win on the stage a 
great name, 
The late Edwin Forrest deservedly has gained, 
A 
seat in the temple of fame. 
Lucille Western has gone, but her name ne'er forgot, 
Shall be written in letters of gold. 
Mrs. Conway, Brooklyn's favorite actress also, 
But in song shall her triumph be told. 
Claude Burroughs was found when the day-light appeared, 
As he lay by the side of his friend, 
harry Murdoch he died, as the flames he defied, 
And his drama of life was at end. 
There is also another, may his name ever be, 
As his own native island kept green, 
Our favorite Irish Comedian, Barney Williams now holds, 
A 
seat in the temple of fame.

THE BLOODLESS DUEL. 
FRANK LEWIS'S Great Song. 
'TWAS a 
cold winter's night, when King Frost held the sway, 
And darkness it reined all around, 
A 
mysterious man with revenge in his mind. 
Did wait till his victim was found. 
Waiting, he'd sworn he would wait till the dawn, 
For the man who had promised to wed 
The sister he loved, and he vowed in his wrath, 
lie would ' punch' the young editor's head. 
At last a 
tall figure appeared on the steps, 
As down to his sleigh he did hie, 
But he scarcely. had gained the sidewalk, ere a 
blow 
Caused him in the glitter to lie. 
The mysterious man cried " Revenge I 
will have 
And the wrongs of my 'sister efface." 
And " May" to " December," he quickly did turn 
In a 
map on the editor's face. 
.
-Fighting, they fought, as young heroes did fight, 
In the glorious days of old Greece. 
When to part them, alas, not a " cop" was in sight, 
Nor a 
blue-coated squad of police. 
The poor man was lifted up by his friends, 
They his story of wrong tried to draw, 
He muttered, " The girl T 
did love as my life 
But could not stand that old mother-in-law." 
The scene it is changed to a 
bleak turnip field, 
And grim death, hovered high in the air. 
Not knowing which State, human blood would be shed, 
Maryland, or the great. Delaware. 
Slaughter, yes that was the name of the town, 
Where the foemen were ready to fight, 
i3nt, they stood such a 
distance, where the seconds them placed 
That they seemed for to be out of sight. 
Blood-thirsty, you bet, for red blood it was shed, 
The fueman they can't explain how. 
At the worth, quick they fired, but a 
strange thing to say, 
The only man shot was a 
cow. 
Gordon Bennett he winked, Fred Ni ay blew his nose, 
Their hearts with forgiveness did swell, 
They threw down their pistols, ran quick o'er the snow, 
into each others arms quick they fell. 
Dr. Phelps then his surgical instrument drew, 
Not a 
ball from the men to pull back, 
But to put it by far, to a 
much better use, 
A cork from a 
bottle extract. 
They all did shake bands, ana soon started for home, 
With blood-thirsty duels content,

THINGS THAT OUGHT NEVER TO BE. 
An original 
ong, swig by FRANK LEWIS with great sucTess 
THERE'S a 
great ninny things have been done in this world, 
You will find it so hard to believe, 
A 
great many born are quite good of their kind, 
While some seem but made to deceive. 
So your attention I'll ask for a 
moment or more, 
And the theme of my song you will see, 
My subject I'm sure will please one and all, 
Of things that ought not to be. 
From beginning of time, until this very day, 
From swindles we've never been tree, 
And. I'll try to describe as I 
go thro' my song, 
Some things that ought never to be. 
Our young- ladies How wear a 
comical dress, 
Blown up like a 
bladder behind, 
Madam fashion ordains it should set tight in front, 
With a 
baloon and a 
clothes- prop combined. 
On the top of their heads a 
long steeple they wear, 
'Tis,a mountain of back-hair to see; 
Should they ever•fall over, they'd never get up. 
Its a 
thing that ought never to be. 
From beginning of, &e. 
I 
have known a 
poor girl trudging home from her work, 
As by some rich fop she would run, 
Proclaim the attention of some passer by 
From Ws ape in the form of a 
man 
I 
have seen gallant sailors and soldiers also, 
Who were wounded by land and sea, 
Turning round a 
hand-organ the picture of woe, 
Ifs a 
thing that ought never to be. 
From beginning of, ke. 
When a 
poor man is arrested for stealing a 
loaf, 
His pale starving family to save, 
He will go for a 
year. with hard labor I'm told, 
While his children may go to the grave. 
But let a 
swell steal by millions, or, else rob a 
bank. 
With the money he soon will be free, 
They'll imprison the poor man while the rich live at ease, 
It's a 
thing that ought never to be.

THE HONEST WORKING CLASSES 
An Original Song by Mr. FRANE LEWIS. 
How the world has wrote the pi aises of our politicans of fame, Sir— 
And balls and suppers given them in honor of their name, Sir. 
The Poets, too, have sung of them, and such kind favor passes ; 
But none have sung in praise of our honest working classes. 
There's many a 
battle has been won by those who get no thanks Sir; 
The tide of victory oft been turned by the solid poor man's rank Sir: 
Where would they be, these nabobs and dictators of the masses, 
If it was not for the solid votes of our honest working classes. 
The honest, brown face working man, with his hands so tough and 
hard, Sir, 
A 
trudging to his daily toil, is the noblest work of God, Sir. 
No Duke's or Earl's fine silver plate, e'er equals or surpasses 
The homely, plain tin dinner pails of our honest working classes. 
Now, I 
think it would be about as well, for those high up in office, 
To try and help the poor man. and feed his empty coffers— 
Take the money that they spend for w!ne, big suppers and fine 
dashes, 
And feed the starving children of our honest working classes. 
There's the newsboys and the bootblacks, often sick, poor and for-
lorn, Sir, 
They meet the ignorant snob's contempt, the haughty rich man's 
scorn Sir; 
But some may go to Congress, and there control the masses— 
A 
noble representative of our honest working classes. 
Now, there are good men, brave and true, who represent our nation 
And who will not be offended at any insinuations : 
There are some, by deeds have earned their names, not by gold or 
clink of glasses, 
But have nobly risen, step by step, frun nnt• honest working classes!

DON'T GET WEARY CHILDREN, 
Sung with great success by JOHN ROACH. 
Olt Johnny you've been a 
bad boy, 
For to treat your true love so, 
And if you don't behave yourself; 
I'll let the old folks know. 
CHORUS, first. 
(Repeat.) 
Don't get weary, don't get weary children, 
Don't get weary, for l's a

Don't get weary, don't get weary children, 
Don't get weary, for I's a 
going home. 
CHORUS, second. 
When the sun rise in the morning, 
Down by the yellow corn, 
There we darkies all take warning, 
When Dina blows the horn. 
CHORUS, third. 
(Repeat.) 
When I'm gone you will miss me, I 
When I'm gone you will miss me, 
There is one kind heart will miss me when 
I'm gone, yes when I'm gone. (Repeat.) 
Oh Susie I've been a 
bad boy, 
But I 
wont do so any more, 
And if you give me your heart and hand, 
We'll go to the old Virginia shore. (Repeat.)

Now a

I 
thought of the present. I

I 
thought of the strange things we're is ers day meeting, 
And to tell you my meaning shall now be my task. 
We have not Patrick Henry, who spoke for our freedom ; 
We have tot Lafayette, who iron, France came to light— 
But we have Mr. Grant and his many relations, 
Who would like a 
third t. ,rm, just to set niLtters right. 
We have not General Geo. Mead, Gettysburgh's Hero, 
But we have the brave Shernmn, wno marched to the Sea. 
We have not Geo. Peabody, the poor man's true friend— 
But his name in our memory ever shall be. 
We have lost poor Jim Fisk, who sent food to Chicago, 
When the fire fiend upon thon made such a 
great raid; 
But we have Moody and Sankey, who set weak people cranky, 
And send 3 
on to Glory, all stamped and prepaid. 
We have lost Mr. Lincoln, who gave the slaves Freedom! 
But we have Jay Cooke, who took from the bank all the tin; 
And we have our gallant Phil Sheriden, Winchester's great Hero, 
He strove for his conntr: bright laurels to win. 
We have lost our Great Father, our pride and our glory, 
Our Washington, who from our hearts shall ne'er fade: 
But we have gt.11ant Little Mac, who at Antietam lighting. 
Quite proved that in battle he was not afraid. 
Ben Franklin has left us. and Henry Clay also ;

IT'S ONLY A 
QUESTION OF TIME. 
An Original Song by FRANK LEWIs. 
In the batt]e of life, if you would win in the strife, 
Should you fail at the start, try again: 
Keep a 
stiff upper lip, never give up the ship , 
Sunshine always comes after Jain. 
Whatever you do, strive to push your way through. 
And keep this sound maxim in mind, 
Fortune favors the brave, she'll yet come to your aid— 
It is only a 
question of time, 
CHORUS. 
So, if for a 
fortune or fame you may strive 
Or a 
wife suited just to your mind : 
Go in with a 
will, your time will come still— 
It is only a 
question of time. 
Our Conductors are fond of milk punches, they say: 
But the Bell Punches, they made them sick. 
For the Spotters discovered their secret machines, 
They rang under their arms with a 
click. 
Now, the secret is out, and their pickings they miss : 
Knocking down's almost ceased on our lines: 
But somo Yankee will invent an improvement on this— 
It is only a 
question of time. 
Cnours. 
Directors are sharp. but Conductors are dy, 
They have gat these things down pretty fine; 
They will soon punch this Bell Punch, and semi it sky high! 
It is only a 
quest 'on of time. 
My friend Jones has been married flue years now or so, 
He's the father of five—so they say— 
But what's strange to relate and curious to know, 
I 
have not one, though I 
pray. 
But my mother-in-law says, now don't you despair, 
Fight it out, my boy, on that same line! 
Dame Nature will be good to you never fear— 
It is only a 
question of time. 
Caortus. 
Now I 
give this advice as it was given to me, 
If your family affairs are like mine': 
It your house has no heir, why never despair— 
It is only a 
question of time.

LATE TELEGRAM SONG. 
As Sung Originally by Mr. FRANK LEWIS. 
I 
am going to sing a 
little song, if you'll listen unto me, 
I 
have all the late dispatches that have come o'er land and sea: 
There are some will make you sob and cry, and others make you laugh 
The many funny messages sent through my telegraph. 
The Fenians have conquered Holland, old Turkey's taken sick; 
They've made an Indian Princess of our good old friend Queen Vie. 
They're impeaching gr. Belknap, because his Agents tried 
To find how long 'twould take to starve a 
soldier, ere he died. 
Dom Pedto's caught the measles from off the Prince of Wales ; 
Ward Beecher has joined the Mormons, so quietness prevails. 
Fred Grant has killed old Sitting Bull, he's earned his monthly pay: 
He left his Pop in Washington, he couldn't stay away: 
The Italian nation have come o'er, they would rather work than beg; 
They spend their time in emptying out each Dutchman's lager keg. 
BOSS Tweed has been discovered, a 
strange thing you will say; 
He was shoveling garbage from the scows to fill up New York Bay, 
The working men are still crushed down beneath reformer's power; 
They manage just to starve themselves on 20 cents an hour. 
Prince Bismark has a 
Baby, he's now left in the lurch; 
The ladies sweet of Boston town, have bought the old South Church, 
Billy Wickham shaved his whiskers off, Dan Drew his debts has paid. 
Dr. Dix has learned the Can-Can along with Whitelaw Reid. 
Ben Butler's lost his larboard eye, so he can see no more; 
'Twas found in Mike Norton's chowder pot, on Coney Island shore. 
Harry Hill has joined the T. A. B.'s, along with Peter Dwyer; 
The cow has broken loose again that caused the Chicago fire. 
Count Johannes and Doctor Landis have got into a 
fight; 
As to sec which of the two can play the ghost of Hamlet right. 
Sammy Tilden soon will married be and have some babies born; 
He proposed to Susan Anthony, Tennie Claflin and Kate Thorn. 
Mr. Belzebub's arrived in town to visit Uncle Sam; 
And what his busitess is I'll tell in my next Telegram.

SCENES ON THE BOWERY. 
Dedicated to M R. HARRY M INER, of Volk's Garden. 
An Original Song, as Sung by FRANK LEWIS, with im-
mense success. 
I 
have been thro' the streets in each City 
In Germany, Englatm and Borne ; 
But the street on which I've made this ditty, 
Is the pride of them all here at home. 
From the pole to the great fiery regions, 
Where the sun in its fierceness is seen, 
There is nought like the Bowery for pleasure, 
And in all the great places I've been. 
CHORUS. 
They may talk of the pleasures of Paris, 
The buildings you see in Berlin ; 
The remains of Solomon's Gre..it Temple. 
But the Bowery I 
would rather live in. 
Of course we don't do the Grand Opera, 
With gloves aud a 
spy-glass to peep; 
Nor our gents part their hair in the middle, 
And appear like Sankey's lost sheep, 
But you bring your dear wife or your sweetheart, 
Your sister or mother—with glee, 
You enjoy a 
good song and some lager, 
The Bowery's the place, boys, for me. 
They may talk, & c, 
Is the homestead of mighty Frank Duffy, 
And our great Harry Howard, so brave ; 
The place where he risked his life boldly, 
When the child from the fire he did save. 
'Tis the home of Ton. Hamblin and Kirby, 
The triumph of Fox as a 
clown; 
The place Tony Po stor coined money, 
And made his big 11.t in the town. 
They may talk, &c. 
• 
'Tis the spot Barney Williams appeared in, 
Our Lingard, and many of the rest; 
And our New York's Great favorite, Gus Williams, 
"i4 hose efforts were crowned with success. 
We have not the Swells as Or Broadway, 
Nor the damsels of fashion you'd see ; 
But for bright eyes and sons of hard labor, 
They can't beat the Old Bowery. 
They may talk, Sce, 
As Sung by him with Great Success. 
A stands for alphabet, which we learned in school. 
B stands for Beecher and old Sitting Bull ! 
And for Belknap, who lately they tried to impeach. 
C stands for Custar ! he :±arged on the foe, 
And died where the Big Horn's dark waters flow : 
And D is the the Dutferin ! the Yacht that we beat. 
And E is old England, which we did always defeat. 
The e )untry which Miss Emma Mine went to cheat. 
Now F is Young Farragut ! who nailed to the mast, 
The Flag of his country, so firm and so fast. 
And Fox the great clown. we have lost evermore. 
And G stands for Garner ! who gave up his life 
On board the Mohawk, for to save his dear wife. 
And II stands for Horace. the gratest and best ! 
Who told all the people they'd better go West ! 
And I 
for old Ireland ! that gem of the sea. 
.11 is John Morrissey, the workingman's friend : 
And K is King Pedro ! who home we did send. 
And L is Liberty ! for which we fought. 
M is a 
Morman, who ten wives can stand ! 
71i is Napoleon, who found his Sedan ! 
0 is Old Brigham ! not lone and forlorn 
For to him eaeh morn o 
baby is born ! 
And P the Prince of Wales, who went Tigers to shoot. 
Q is Queen Victoria! an Empress now made. 
It is bold Reno ! of the foe not afraid; 
Ho fought the red demons as a 
soldier should fight. 
And S 
is the Surplus there never will be, 
'Till the poor man on Sunday the big show can see. 
T is Tom Scott ! he's of Railroads the King. 
U is Ulysses ! the Chief of the Ring ! 
But he'll soon leave the White House, which will be a 
big 
thing. 
V that is Virtue, a 
thing now forgot ; 
Go search the world over and you'll find it not ; 
Our Congressmen, certain, did out the name blot. 
But W stands for a 
man with a 
name, 
The greatest of all, in the Temple of Fame !— 
He braved every tyrant, our freedom he won--
God bless him, forever, our CIWII Washington ! 
The bravest of all since the world it begun. 
"ti stands for example, it' you leave out the E. 
And V the Young Ladies, who around me I 
see— 
At the bottom of most trouble they are always the cause. 
And Z is the Zenith of all things—the end— 
Which a 
man surely feels if lie has not a 
friend. 
And 110W that I've sung my Alphabet through, 
I, for your kind attention, respectfully thank you, 
And I 
hope I've deserved your kind applause.

Man3T' Things that Ought not to Be: 
An Original Song by FRANK LEWIS. 
As suug by him 
at Fox's Theatre, Philadelphia. 
There is not a 
de y 
as we pass thro' this life, 
And I 
think you will with me agree, 
There are many mistakes in this world we do meet, 
And things that ought not to be. 
Is it right that a 
soldier who fought in the war, 
And lost, perhaps an arm or a 
leg, 
Should grind a 
hand-organ to please passers by, 
And for food, on our charity beg ? 
CHORUS. 
These thin s 
should be stopped in this great land of ours* 
Where every man boasts he is free; 
So I 
thought I'd tell you, by words in my song, 
Many things that ought not to be. 
Is it right that each Savings Dank always should break, 
And the depositors receive not a 
dime ; 
Is it right, the ladies, striped stockings should wear, 
And knock us poor men out of time. 
Is it right a 
poor workman should wear out his life, 
And earn but one sixty a 
day, 
While some roll in riches, big sinecures hold ? 
These are things that ought not to be. 
Them things should be, & c. 
Is it right that our army it should be cut down 
To save but a 
dollar or two; 
Was it right to send Custer and a 
few hundred men, 
To be killed by the wild Indian foe; 
Is it right to mix silver with copper and brass, 
And give it to us to make change; 
Is it right to let Spain still give us the laugh. 
When the Virginius we've yet to revenge ? 
These things should be, &c. 
Is it right that the White House should bear the name 
Of Headquarters! where swindles are done; 
Where they steal all they can from a 
poor soldier's food, 
To a 
barrel of whiskey or rum; 
Is it right, when we've millions of acres to spare. 
And all the whole world we could feed, 
That a 
man should be poor, in this great laud of ours, 
For which our brave fathers did bleed ? 
Thes.! t'ilegs should be, &c, 
31 
I'll Laugh! And that's Always the 
Last of It. 
Original Music by Paor. JAS. KENNEDY. 
Sung by M R. 
FRANI{ LEWIS, at Fox's Theatre, Philadelphia. 
'Tis my maxim in life to aoid care and strife, 
And to walk through this world with a 
smile; 
How I 
pity the man, who to laugh never can, 
Has no joy his sad hours to beguile. 
Let us live by the way, think how short is our stay. 
Do not waste time with foolish repining, 
You will act a 
wise part if you take to your heart, 
Every bright ray of light that is hining,. 
CHORCS. 
So a 
fig for despair, I 
will drive away care, 
I 
regret not my life what is past A it; 
If sorrow draws nigh, to defeat it I'll try; 
I'll laugh! and that's the last ot it. 
If the girl that I 
love, she should false to me prove, 
Do you think I 
would sit down and cry— 
No I 
would start out anew, other dear ones pursue, 
And to live out my trouble, would try. 
I'd keep a 
stiff upper lip ; never give up the ship, 
The sad wrinkles of woe ever scorning; 
Though dense be the shroud of a 
darkening cl oud, 
'Tis dispelled by the sunlight of morning. 
So a 
fig for desair, & c. 
Did I 
once trust a 
friend and was wronged in the end, 
Still the sweet cup of joy I 
would quaff ; 
And if trouble it came, not a 
soul would I 
blame, 
Bet my manhoud I'd rouse wi ii a 
laugh ; 
Not a 
tear would I 
shed, but be jolly instead, 
For sorrow I 
never could borrow; 
I'd with patience abide, ' till the turn of fhe tide, 
And the bright sun it shone on the morrow. 
So a 
fig for despair, & c.

THE BUSY B'S. 
An Original Song, as Sung by FRANK LEWIS, with im-
mense success. 
A 
strange name for my song I've selected, 
But still I 
will try yon to please ; 
They are men of bad deeds been suspected, 
And I'll call them the great Busy B's. 
Now it's simply because that same letter, 
Is the one that commences their name ; 
So I 
took it for want of a 
better— 
They are men of renown and great fame. 
Clio tuts. 
Now Belzebub was the first B, 
He made Eve steal the fruit from the tree, sir; 
Caused mankind its shame first to see sir, 
He was the most wonderful B. 
Belshazzar one.day gave a 
dinner, 
And invited his Senators, all ; 
But he found he was scarcely a 
winner, 
When the writing appeared on the wall. 
Brigham Young gets his wives by the hundred, 
He's babies, I'm told, by the score ; 
But not satisfied, the old rascal, 
He is constantly wishing for more. 
CHORUS. 
Ben Butler with one eye does see sir— 
He goes that same eye on a 
fee sir— 
He is a 
most comical B, sir, 
That ever this nation did see. 
Mr. Beecher, to the people still preaches. 
Giving sly winks at each pretty Miss ; 
Henry Bowen says bad things he teaches • 
He is best at a 
sweet fragrant kiss. 
Spain speaks of apologies given--
Will that bring the dead back to life ? 
Will that aid the wives and the children 
Of the victims who fell in the strife? 
33 
Cimitus. 
We want Burril, the butcher, on high, sir, 
On a 
gibbet that shall reach the sky, sir 
Like the men he has murdered, to die, sir; 
Not till then will we listen to Spain. 
Mr. Blaine is a 
B 
that was Speaker, 
He hails from away down in iNlaine; 
For the chair in the White House, a 
seeker, 
No fool of a 
B, was old Blaine. 
Mr. Babcock, the gay and the frisky, 
Is a 
B 
that went in for the tin; 
He made his small pile out of whiskey— 
But stealing by law is no sin. 
CHORUS. 
Boss Tweed and Boss Shephard, so great, sir, 
Made cash at a 
tremendous rate, sir; 
Our currency went to inflate, sir— 
These men were such Busy B's. 
But the worst B 
of all in the nation, 
Who late did his pockets well fin— 
is the one from the poor soldier's ration 
Did steal what he could at Fort Sill. 
Aaron Burr, we are told, was a 
Traitor--
For his country he did not care a 
rap; 
Though, peihaps his proud soul did hate her— 
Was he worse than our General Belknap? 
CHORUS. 
Such men you'll agree with me, sir, 
Are a 
disgrace to the land of the free, sir ; 
'Tis in prison they all ought to be, sir, 
These wonderful great Busy B's,

THE PATRIOT'S DREAM. 
Copyrighted 1876, and Music Pub. E. 
H. 
HARDING, 229 Bowery, N. 
Written and adapted by FRANK LEWIS, 
One morn when thinking o'er events, 
In our Central Park so great, 
On a 
rustic bench I 
sat, 
O'er things to ruminate ; 
When sleep o'ercame me for a 
time, 
A 
dense mist did arise ; 
A 
panorama of strange forms 
Did pass before my eyes! 
I 
raised aloft my wond'ring gaze, 
It seemed to pierce the clouds. 
As by me pass'd, in strange army, 
A 
great and bustling crowd. 
I 
notic'd each familiar face, 
And marked each stirring scene, 
The record of a 
hundred years— 
I 
saw them in my dream. 
The fog to me it cleared away, 
There came a 
brilliant light, 
And as a 
Keystone to the Arch 
Theie shone a 
rainbow bright! 
And in the centre Freedom stood, 
Aloft— she rais'd her hand— 
And pointed, as they pass'd me by, 
Unto the patriot band! 
I 
saw the men of Boston march, 
So noiseless to the Sea, 
To strike the Keynote of our fame, 
And overthrow the tea; 
And then I 
saw them swiftly go 
To Concord's distant town, 
Where low the Union Jack did droop, 
By Freedom's sons cast down. 
I 
next saw Lafayette embark 
To cross the raging main • 
Saw Warren lying stark and stiff, 
When in the battle slain ; 
35 
Saw Putnam ride his gallant steel 
Way down those stairs, so swift, 
And Washington upon the ice 
Of Delaware, adrift ! 
T 
next did see our gallant boT; , 
In Valley Forge, forlorn; 
And still their hearts with patriot fin. 
Defied the wintry storm; 
Then came upon my vision 
A 
dark cloud in the sky— 
it was the traitor, Arnold, 
That in shame was passing by. 
A 
ray of light the cloud dispelled, 
As Paulding glided by 
With Major Andre in his grasp, 
As he went forth to die ! 
Saw Jefferson the paper write, 
Which made us slaves no more! 
Our glorious Constitution, bo3 s 
As wrote in days of yore: 
Saw Lincoln sign the Freedom 
Of all men throughout the land! 
And Ethan Allen take the Fort, 
By Lake Champlaine does stand; 
Saw Jackson with his cotton bales, 
Defy the invading foe ; 
And Taylor hold our banner up 
Way down in Mexico. 
But at this moment I 
awoke, 
As loud a 
bell did ring, 
And saw unto the breeze our Flag 
Its graceful emblem fiing! 
I 
saw old Independence Hall. 
So bright in the sun's ray, 
As Hancock to the people spoke, 
" 'Tis our Centennial Day !" 
And all the spirits of my dream 
Did join in joyful cry— 
This is the year of Seventy-Six--
The Fourth day of July! 
And sweet Columbia, far above, 
She pointed down with pride 
Unto our Flag, and proudly said— 
" 
It has the world defied !"

THE BROOKLYN FIRE. 
Written by THF. MURRAYS, ED. and ALICE, and sung by GE(). MERRA1% 
Oh 
sad and dismal is the tale 
I 
will relate to you : 
'Tis of the Brooklyn Fire, and 
The souls that perished, too. 
You all have heard their awful fate, 
The old, the young, and gay; 
That ill-starred band, by heaven's commard, 
Are dead and passed away. 
They left their homes so gay and free, 
With joy on every lip, 
And in their blithest moment, ah, 
There came that fatal slip. 
The demon fire raged around, 
Not one to check its sway; 
All fear and strife once full of life, 
Are dead and passed away. 
But blame to none, it was Heaven's shaft 
That struck that happy throng ; 
The king of terrors wakened where 
He slept so deep and long. 
The poor souls in the gallery, who 
Enjoyed that fatal play, 
They little thought their lives were sought— 
They are dead and passed away. 
There are some of those departed ones 
Are well known to you all: 
Harry Murdock and his partner 
Met death within those halls, 
In years to come we'll not forget, 
Though feeble, old, and gray, 
Their souls bereft they would have left, 
They are dead and passed away. 
I 
am a 
girl of style you see, 
And everywhere I 
go, 
Some fellows always follow me 
If I 
walk fast or slow. 
Perhaps they think my heart is true, 
Or I 
have lots of cash, 
Or its cardinal red or navy blue 
I 
wear with such a

strolled out one evening. 
The Sun had just gone dowh, 
While leisurely meandering 
A

I 
there beheld a 
damsel 
With eyes the brightest blub, 
Beneath her dark eye-lashes, 
Like Violets dipped in dew. 
CHORUS. 
A 
smile,was all she gave me, ( Symph.) 
But how it did enslave me, 
'Twas love, the first I 
knew : 
There's some sweet charm entrancing 
Within her eyes so blue, 
A 
dreamy, soft expression, 
Like Violets dipped in dcw. 
I 
followed on behind her, 
I 
think she knew it well, 
And as a 
sweet reminder, 
Her handkerchief it fell ; 
I 
raised the scented linen 
From off the grassy ground; 
Her name, in letters crimson, 
, On one corner there I 
found. 
Cnours. 
She deigned to smile upon me, (Symph.) 
That moment she had won me, 
My heart it pierced me through ; 
There's some sweet charm entrancing, 
Within her eyes so blue ; 
A 
dreamy soft expression. 
Like Violets dipped in dew. 
At length I 
did approach her, 
And ventured into talk, 
By asking her permission 
To join her lonely walk ; 
She blushing, frowning, smiling, 
Said, " Oh ! I 
think you're rude ;" 
But those blue eyes, beguiling, 
Seemed to say, I 
wish you would. 
Cuonus. 
So arm in arm we wandered, ( Symph.) 
'es, side by side meandered, 
And told our love tales too. 
Vhere's some sweet charm entrancing,

DORKINS' NIGHT. 
Written by BOBBY NEwcomn, and sung with great success by 
, 
W ILLIem SCANLAN, at the Olympic Theatre, Broadway, N. Y. 
Music published by JOHN PERRY, Washington St., opposite Boston 
Theatre, Boston, Mass. 
The theatre was full—it was Dorkins' night— 
That is, Dorkins was going to appear 
At night, in a 
favorite comedy part, 
For he was comedian here. 
Funny! why, he'd make you laugh, till the tears 
Ran down your face like rain; 
And every time he came on the stage, 
You'd try to stop laughing in vain. 
A 
family? Yes, he'd a 
family, 
And he lov'd them as dear as his life; 
And you'd scarcely find a 
happier lot 
Than Dorkins' child' P14 and wife. 
And you'd scarcely find a 
happlor lot 
Than Dorkins' children and wife, 
There came one night, and I 
was in front, 
And Dorkins was going to play 
A 
character new to himself and the stage, 
Which he'd trod for many a 
day. 
By eight the theatre was perfectly jammed, 
All awaited a 
pleasant surprise; 
For they knew they'd laugh 'till their sides would ache 
And they long'd for the curtain to rise. 
The play soon began—each neck was stretched forth, 
And eagerly watched each eye, 
For Dorkins to make his first entrance, and then 
To give him a 
cheerful hi! hi! 
For Dorkins to make his first entrance, and then 
To irive him a 
cheerful hi I 
hi 
.kt last he appeared, amid loud applause, 
But something was wrong you could see; 
"Why, Dorkins is playing quite badly to-night!" 
The people said, sitting ' round me. 
A 
hiss! yes, it was; I 
saw Dorkins start 
As if stung by a 
serpent's fang; 
And he'd cast a 
beseeching look all 'round, 
While his head on his breast he would hang. 
' 
He's drunk!" some one said, and I 
thought so myself, 
For, to me, it was awful at times, 
To see how he'd struggle along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines, 
To see how he'd struggle along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines. 
The footlights, at last, he approached very slow, 
And, " Ladies and gentlemen," said— 
"If I 
cannot please you to- night, 
The fault's not the heart, but the head. 
There's many a 
night I've made you all laugh, 
When so ill I 
could scarcely well stand; 
And every effort was pain to me then— 
Yes, if even Id raise but my hand. 
You hiss me to-night, and say that I'm drunk," 
From his heart came a 
sob and a 
moan; 
"I'll tell you the reason—I 
know you won't laugh— 
I've a 
little one dying at home! 
I'll tell you the reason—I 
know you won't laugh— 
I've a 
little one dying at home!"

There are friends you deem true, they will linger near you, 
In the flush of prosperity's hours, 
But in poverty's day, they will vanish away, 
Like the fading of summer's sweet flowers. 
As you journey along in life's turbulent throng, 
While the hill sides you climb or descend, 
You will see it some day. I 
am right when I 
say 
That your pocketbook is your best friend; 
That your pocketbook is your best friend. 
CuoRus. 
'Tis a 
friend that you need, zunl a 
true friend indeed, 
Ever ready to give or to lend; 
For wherever you go, you will find it is so, 
That your pocketbook is your best friend; 
That your pocketbook is your best friend. 
Our political life is nothing hut strife, 
Where all honor is swallowed in gain; 
But to hint such a 
thing to a 
man of the ring, 
Why of course they would call you insane. 
Many a 
man is in power at this very same hour 
That our honest votes never would send : 
And the way is done is quite plain to each one, 
Why their pocketbook was their best friend. 
'Tis a 
friend, 
There's a 
gay young cashier, with a 
thousand a 
year, 
And his horses and ladies and wine, 
Oh, he goes at a 
rate quite alarming to state. 
Though he draws on a 
very big mine. 
They discover, some day, he has gambled away 
Many thousands or more, and the end 
Is, they give him a 
year, after that he gets clear. 
For his pocketbook is his best friend.

THE ACTOR'S GREAT BALL. 
An Original Song by FRANK LEWIS. 
As sung by bird 
with Great Success. 
A 
comical story I'm going to tell you, 
I 
wrote it to please both the great and the small; 
It's about some good fun I 
had in this City, 
One night at the Actor's Professional Ball. 
The first set of Quadrilles was danced bi Tony Pastor, 
Of which Clara Morris the figures did call. 
Mr. Daly and Pique waltzed round faster and faster— 
There was fun, you can bet at the Actor's 
reat Ball! 
Josh Hart brought his Eagle to fly at the party, 
John Brougham a 
kiss from Miss Neilson lie took! 
Lester Wallack, he shaved off his whiskers, and gave them 
Unto the two Orphans of Sheridan Shook. 
Mr. Levy, he played on his Cornet, a 
Solo, 
As he sat in the Crucible of Oakey Hall! 
Pat Rooney and Harry Bennett, to enliven the meeting, 
Danced the Tra-la-loo, at the Actor's Great Ball. 
Jennie Engle appeared with her flys used in singing, 
And Sol Smith Russell commenced for to blow. 
Harry Hill's Female Bosers wentin to fling him. 
To the place underneath, where all Actors do go. 
Then Kelly and Leon went in rough and tumble, 
Tore Leon's new dress, which cost thousands, he'll say. 
Gus Williams got his steam up and bursted his lynler, 
And John Hart, the skeleton, he fainted away. 
Billy Pastor then tried to waltz with Miss Markham, 
But his body was ler_ e 
and his legs they were small— 
So he got the two Brahams to drop all their H's, 
They tripped up Jennie Hughes, her sweet vocals and all. 
Anna Dickinson then danced, her crown of thorns wearing. 
Which gave to the critics an unmerciful shock. 
While Jarrett S
T., Palmer made Tooker keep swearing— 
There was no boat afloat like the great Plymouth Rock! 
As daylight approached, the fun kept increasing; 
Mr. Theodore Moss called his Jockey a 
f001 
Then Boucicault came in with a 
play he had stolen, 
And closed up the daylights of friend John F. Poole. 
.4 Just then occurred what you would call a 
commotion; 
sate Claxton had Fannie Davenport Pinned ,gainst the wall. 
Jlarrigan R.; Hart then appeared in their unequalled effusions, 
...1And that put an end to the Actors Great Ball!

Written by W ILLIAM BRYANT for MISS LIZZIE RICHMOND. 
While sitting by the fire one day, 
A subject came to me, 
How people get along so nice, 
And how I 
can not see. 
Some people have just what they want, 
Believe me, I 
am true; 
You needn't take my word for that, 
I'll leave it all to you. 
Now has it e'er occurred to you, 
(How strange it seems to me 0 
These girls they glide along the streets— 
Much less than twenty-three. 
Their pa's are poor, but still they dress 
In silks and satins, too, 
Now how they get all these good clothes— 
I'll leave it all to you. 
A man and wife that I 
know well, 
Don't agree, I 
must confess; 
Because they have no children 1.4 
Complete their happiness. 
The father wants a 
little girl, 
And ma a 
boy, that's two; 
Now how they're going to get them— 
I'll leave it all to you. 
So now I've sung my rhymes to you, 
I 
hope I've pleased you all; 
Some other night 
be all right 
To make another call. 
And when I 
come back here to sing, 
bring you something new; 
But that is not for me to say— 
So I'll leave it all to you_

BOSTON FIRE, 
As sung by W ILLIAM SCANLAN. 
(Air—" Pat Won't Go Home Till Morning.") 
It was only on the tenth of last November, 
That we heard the news we ever shall remember, 
That the tire- king had cast its burning embers 
O'er another fated city in our land. 
As the woeful tidings flashed along the wire, 
Of this other sail catastrophe so dire, 
That Boston, beauteous city, was on lire, 
And sinking ,neath the fiend's relentless hand, 
Cliours. 
Fire ! fire ! was heard the cry, 
In every breeze that passed us by, 
And all the world did heave a 
sigh of pity; 
Fervent prayers to Heaven to aid, 
Before the fire in ruins laid, 
Fair Boston, beauteous city. 
And all through the terrible commotion, 
The wind blew a 
gale from off the ocean, 
The brave firemen worked with all devotion, 
To laugh at their efforts yet it seemed; 
And soared with fiery prayer still higher, 
O'er chimney top, steeple and church spire, 
Till all was one vast flame of fire, 
And the light around the horizon gleamed. 
Cot 
Fire ! fire ! was heard, etc. 
But who saved the city from a 
panic, 
From the rule of a 
fire-king too vrannie, 
lint the brave-hearted firemen and mechanic, 
The best and the noblest in the land ; 
Far brighter than tile soldier's record of glory, 
Are the names of those who live in song or story, 
Who rebuild the city to its former glory, 
And build her up, if possible, more grand. 
Cnours. 
And soon will no trace remain, 
Of this vast sea of flame, 
Boston will rise again remember; 
Brave men will be found, 
Who will build a 
fairer town. 
Like Chicago, from the ground. 
Before the next November.

As Sung by the Fox SISTERS. 
As we pass, day by day, thro' life's busy highway. 
There are many strange people we see ; 
And the worst, I 
conclude, are the ones who intrude 
On our charity, be it so free. 
For they seem to depend upon what we will lend, 
Not a 
dollar they honestly earn ; 
Yet they prosper and thrive, and the way survive 
Is, to borrow and never return 
CHORUS. 
Yes, they borrow but never return, 
So of course it is easy to learn, 
There are some folks that live, not to spend or to give, 
But to borrow and never return 
If you lay up in store a 
few dollars or more, 
Upon this you can truly depend, 
They will sure find it out, and they'll chase you about, 
Till they force you your money to lend. 
If you doubtingly say, 
I'm afraid you won't pay," 
Such ideas of course they will spurn ; 
And you'll find out some day, I 
am right when I 
say, 
That they borrow, but never return 
Yes, they borrow, &c. 
In the fashion they dress, and their manners express 
They have plenty to eat and to wear ; 
But they'd be in the shade if their bills were all poi() 
And the poor-house would have them in care. 
'Tis no wonder they smile when they pass you in sty14,3
- — 
It is better to beg than to earn ; 
While it's true, as a 
rule, they will deem you a 
fool, 
Whe::: they borrow, to never return

An original song of the escape of the Fenians' from Australia 
as written and sung by the great Irish Comedian and Vocalist. 
JAMES O'NEIL. 
NOW boys if you will listen, to the story I'll relate, 
I'll tell you of the noble men, who from the foe escaped. 
Though bound with Saxon fetters, in the dark Australian jail, 
They struck a 
blow for freedom, and for Yankee land set sail. 
On the lith of April last, the stars and stripes did fly, 
On board the bark Catalpa, waving proudly to the sky. 
She showed the green above the red, as she did calmly lay, 
Prepared to take the Fenian boys, in safety o'er the sea. 
When Breslin and brave Desmond, brought the prisoners to the 
shore, 
They gave one shout for freedom, soon to bless them ever more 
And manned by gallant hearts they pulled towards the Yankee 
For well they knew from its proud folds, no tryant could them 
drag. 
They have nearly reached in safety the Catalpa, taut and trim, 
When fast approaching them they saw a 
vision dark and dim. 
It was the steamer " Georgette," and on her deck there stood, 
One hundred hired assassins, to shed each patriot's blood. 
The steamer reached the bounding bark, and fired across he 
bow, 
They in loud voice commanded. that the vessel should " lieave 
to." 
tint noble Captain Anthony, in thunder tones did cry. 
You dare not tire a 
shot at that bright tlag. that floats on high. 
My ship is sailing peacefully beneath that flag of stars. 
I'm manned by Irish hearts of oak, and manly Yankee tars. 
And that dear emblem at the fore, so plain now to be seen. 
'Tis the banner I'll protect, old Ireland's flag of green. 
The Britisher he sailed away, from the stars and stripes he ran' 
He knew his chance was slim to tight. the boys of Tnele Sam' 
So Hogan, Wilson, Harrington. with Darragh off did go. 
With liassett and bold Cranston, soon to whip the Saxon foe. 
ii ere's luck to that noble captain. who well these men did 
lie dared the English-mau-of-war, to light him on the sea. 
And here's to that dear enil dent. whit+ in triumph shall be seen 
The flag for which those patriots fought. dear I 'nouns' flag of

Where they'll stop at, no mortal can say ; 
But the latest and greatest of mysteries, 
Which all other wonders surpass, 
To go down in posterities' hisfries, 
Are these wonderful panes of blue glass. 
'Tis a 
science none others compare to, 
The philosopher's stone found at last, 
For ' twill cure all the ills flesh is heir to, 
These wonderful panes of blue glass. 
If a 
pane of blue glasF., you put over 
The head of your mother-in-law, 
She'll be tame as a 
laint 
spring clover, 
And she cant even wag her own jaw; 
Your own wife w+)nt dare ask where you've been to, 
If a 
night at your club you should pass, 
if you have in your own bed- room windows, 
These wonderful panes of blue glass. 
'Tisa science, etc. 
'Twould do well in the windows of churches, 
It might keep the preachers from sin. 
And in street cars ' mould make the conductors, 
Account for each fare they takc ; 
And if you had a 
brick in your hat, sir, 
For a 
sober man wanted to pass, 
'Twould be easy for you to do that, sir, 
In your hat put a 
pane of blue glass. 
'Tis a 
science, eto. 
A 
blue goblet full of good whiskey, 
Would be most toe tempting to pass, 
And no temperance mat will get frisky, 
If he drinks his rum from a 
bluc glass; 
All the boarding-house keepers will have them, 
And the boarders will get fat quite fast, 
They can't tell the shirt buttons from grizzle, 
When the hash is served up in blue glass. 
'Tis a 
science, etc. 
If we send up a 
dozen of glaziers, 
To the Capitol with this blue glass, 
Congressmen would be honest as blazes, 
And the days of their stealing be past; 
If we had blue glass ballot boxes, 
We'd have fair elections at last, 
And a 
President upright and honest, 
If the White House was glazed with blue glass. 
'Tis a 
science, ete.

Am:—Don't put your foot or. a 
man when he's down, 
In this world of sorrow, of t 
a 
and regret, 
There are scenes I 
would gladly pass o'er, 
But stern truth compels that each fact must be told, 
That thro' life we may check them the more. 
Is it right that a 
man who has well earned his pay 
On the pipes by the sweat of his brow, 
Should wait like a 
beggar on Green day by day, 
Or else home in hunger to go? 
CHORUA. 
If a 
man is in trouble, remember this song, 
Go drive the grim wolf from his doer, 
Assist him in need. you will seldom be wrong, 
If you never go back on the poor. 
From the wild waste of waters a 
death-cry came, 
As dashed on the iron- bound shore, 
A 
noble ship struck in the darkness of night, 
And sank 'mid the tempest's loud roar. 
The captain asleep and the men off their posts, 
With the coal and provisions run short, 
While the doomed ones they hoped for that bright western 
land, 
Which in joyous sweet dreams they had sought. 
Cnortus. 
Can it he such neglect shall by us be forgot, 
Or that money shall triumph once more, 
N. good willing hand, a 
stout branch and a 
rope, 
Vor those who go back on the poor. 
When the divers went down 'neath the wreck to search 
For the victims that lay far below, 
"'Tis only a 
steerage" Was oft the remark, 
As the ghastly form came up to view. 
As if only a 
steerage could shut out a 
soul, 
Because poverty claimed him her own. 
As if dollars and dimes are the standard of worth. 
And the pass to all good that is known. 
CHORCS. 
But the White Star must change its emblem aloft, 
To blood-red, a-float and ashore, 
Till the steamer Atlantic's forgotten by time, 
With its cargo of unburied poor. 
At the stands on the corner of every street, 
The aged and the blind used to be, 
Xnd work out a 
living to save them from want, 
From the poor-house that they might be free. 
But now stout Italians, healthy and strong, 
Each old grandmother's driven away, 
don't think the people will stand the base wrong, 
Of these people who work under pay. 
CHORUS. 
A 
al the newsboy or bootblack that toils morn and night, 
1'0 keep hunger and pain from the door, 
Have been pushed to the wall by these great organ men, 
t 
us never go back on the poor.

OUR BOYS." 
An American Patriotic and Humorous Song, written and 
Sung by JOLLY NASH. 
Copyrighted 1S75, byW. PoNo 'Az. Co. Music Pub., 547 B'way. N. Y. 
Uncle Sam he was once at a 
festive affair, 
And they called upon Sam for a 
strain, 
So he put out his weed, and toss'd off his glasl, 
And then he commenced this refrain : 
I'll sing of " Our Boys" who have made a 
great name 
Their is Captain Bogardus, said he, 
In Europe he -showed them how well we could shoot, 
His equal you will seldom see. 
Cnoaus. 
He is one of " Our Boys," he is ; 
And we are proud of " Our Boys," we are ; 
If he is honest and true, we give him his due ; 
We are proud of " Our Boys," Hurrah! 
We have got a 
very good Rifle Team, 
They cross'd the wide ocean, you know, 
And defeated the Dollymount marksmen witn ease, 
And won all the prizes, that's so ! 
They've defeated, since th3n, the Canadian Team, 
And although they don't make a 
great noise, 
They could easily beat any marksmen on earth— 
Gildersleeve and his bonny brave boys. 
They belong to " Our Boys," they do, & e. 
When Old Johnny Bull had Livingstone lost, 
And given him up in despair, 
It was one of " Our Boys ,"—Jim Bennett, who sal— 
'or the Doctor I'll now have a 
care. 
It was one of " Our Boys," and a 
plucky one, too, 
Who went out and Livingstone found; 
All honor to Stanley ! may courage like his 
Be always successfully crowned. 
He is one of " Our Boys," &e. 
But chief on the blazing scroll of fame, 
Is one we must never forget ; 
He founded this nation, the pride of creation, 
And astonished the world you may bet! 
George Washington's name by all is revered, 
So fill up each cup and each can, 
And we'll make the roof ring, as we shout and we sing, 
For George was a 
mighty good man. 
Cnoaus. 
He was chief of " Our Boys," he was; 
And we are proud of " Our Boys," we are ; 
ge was honest and true, so give him his due ; 
We are proud of " Our Boys," we are.

FRIEND TO YOU.

You've Been a 
Friend to Me.") 
As Sung by ED. ScuLL7. 
Ah! years have come and gone. dear /fun, 
The past seems like a 
dream, 
When you and I 
together met 
By the winding stream. 
When hand in band we promised, Tom. 
To each we would be true ; 
Old time has made no change in me, 
I'm still a 
friend to you. 
CHORES. 
I'm still a 
friend to you, dear Tow. 
Alas! there are but few 
Have ever been as kind and true, 
As I 
have been to you. 
How often have I 
wept, dear Tern, 
When thinking o'er the joys 
The happy scenes of long ago, 
When you and I 
were boys ; 
But now I'm told, you're very poor, 
Your days in life are few ; 
It gives me joy to meet you, Tom, 
I'm still a 
friend to you. 
I'm still a 
friend, (Ve 
Old friendship often withers, Tom, 
Wbene'er a 
man grows poor; 
The rich and proud forget old friends, 
And know them then no more; 
But k3ep that honest heart of yours, 
We'll make old friendship new ; 
I 
care not what the world may say, 
I'm still a 
friend to you.
