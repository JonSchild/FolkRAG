TO ME PUBLIC, 
BILLY PASTOR 
was born in the City of New York in 1840; at the age of four 
years he was placed under instructions in the circus profes-
sion, where he became an expert tumbler and acrobat, and 
travelled with all the first-class circuses in the United States 
until 1860. 
He then visited Europe as " America's Champion 
Tumbler." In 1862 he made his first appearance in Copen-
hagen as clown. 
Mr. Pastor speaks French, German, Spanish 
and Italian, which enabled him to play the jester in any of 
these languages. 
Signor Scherini, hearing of Mr. 
Pastor's 
accomplishments and qualifications as a 
tumbler, acrobat and 
clown, secured him to appear at his circus in Havana, where 
he made a 
great success. 
After returning to America, he was 
engaged by Spaulding 
Rogers, and travelled one season 
with their circus. 
David Bidwell, of the Academy of Music at 
New Orleans, hearing Mr. Pastor sing, persuaded him to ac-
cept an engagement at his theatre as a 
comic vocalist. 
Since 
that time Mr. Pastor has appeared in every first-class theatre 
of the United States, always being engaged at an enormous 
salary. 
In fact, it is believed that Mr. Pastor has received the 
largest salary of any comic singer playing on an engagement 
in the profession. 
His style is easy and natural, his pronun-
ciation most distinct and intelligent, and the simplest song as 
rendered by him is always agreeable to his audience. 
Mr. 
Pastor never sings old songs. 
His Ivertoire is composed of 
the latest, best and most popular productions. 
In fact, Mr. 
Pastor is the vocalist of " The People," the Singer of the Na-
tion. 
This book will be found very interesting. 
It contains a 
choice collection of co ic, motto and serio-comic songs, as 
sung by Mr. Pastor, and written by the most celebrated song 
writers of tile present day, 
A perusal of the contents will 
couvince the reader of this fact.

OUR COUNTRY'S PAST, 
Written and sung by BILLY PASTOR. 
One evening I 
was sitting by my tire, after tea, 
And in the dying embers there strange si hts I 
seemed to see. 
Our country's great and glorious past, with alllts famous 
names, 
Seemed blazoned there upon my sight, amid the dancing flames. 
And first I 
saw old Putnam, with his noble hero band, 
Upon the heights of Bunker Hill they made their gallant stand; 
And for their country, for their homes, for Freedom struck a 
blow, 
That told the world that we'd be free—one hundred years ago. 
And next I 
saw George Washington, brave Lafayette and Lee, 
And Marion, who forsook their all that we might freemen be. 
And then I 
heard the crashing ice, felt the cold and piercing 
air 
Of that wintry night when Washington crossed o'er the Dela-
ware 
I 
saw them next at Valley Forge, so wretched and so wan, 
But spite of hunger and of want they nobly struggled on, 
Until, at last, at Yorktown, they laid the British low, 
And America at last was free— one hundred years ago. 
But British hate once more attacked the freedom of our land, 
At New Orleans and Lundy's Lane they made a 
bloody stand 
But Winfield Scott and Jackson led us on to victory, 
And drove the baffled British back again into the sea. 
" 
Don't give up the ship, my boys !" I 
heard brave Lawrence 
cry, 
And on Lake Erie saw our hag in triumph floating high ; 
While the British ensign once again to our conquering arms 
bent low, 
And America was free still as--- one hundred years ago, 
• 
F. 
5 
Then Texas threw her shackles off, and called on us for aid, 
Our gallant sons flew quick to arms, and Texas free was made; 
But dear the victory that we bought with the noblest blood on 
earth, 
And let all patriots drop a 
tear to the memory of Worth. 
Then once again the cloud of War rained death upon our land, 
But now Friends are opposed to Friends., men 'gainst their broth-
ers stand: 
And on our fair Columbia the trawls of traitor 
struck a 
blow, 
To break the Union that we formed—one hundred years ago. 
I 
saw Anderson at Sumpter stand, Phil Sheridan's bold ride. 
And Farragut, 'midst the battle's roar, up at his masthead 
tied. 
I 
saw Sherman boldly marching from Atlanta to the sea. 
And.old Abe Lincoln tell the slaves that they at last were free. 
And then, at last, the North and South in unity did dwell, 
And both a 
common brother mourned when gallant C'et8ter fell. 
In every corner of our land is heard work's busy hum, 
And we shall still be freemen— for one hundred years to come! 
.416te, 
If you perceive my bosom heave, 
'Tis caused by prcud delight, 
For I'm a 
very different man 
To what I 
was last night. 
For some time in my house a 
nurse 
Has aired her awkward charms, 
But, I'm glad to say, this morning 
I've found something in her arms. 
SPOKEN.—I 
said to the nurse in a 
very innocent sort of a 
manner : " Why, laws, missy, what have you got in your 
arms?" She placed her finger on her lips and said, " h—s—h— 
CHORUS. 
Don't make a 
noise or else you'll wake the baby, 
Don't make a 
noise or else you'll wake the child; 
Don't kick up a 
row or else you'll disturb the infant," 
I 
feel so awfully aufully jolly, I 
think I 
shall go 
wild 
As soon as e'er the news spread 'round, 
In every neighbor comes; 
Some said " what a 
darling child l" 
And others - Bless its gums:" 
My feelings were so glorious, 
Describe them no one can, 
And the ladies seem to look on we 
As a 
very deTcr man. 
SPOKEN.—‘' Why,' said they, " JP. SI-
cooks, Mr. Snooks, you 
ought to be a 
very happy man ;" " I 
am, lain!" I 
replied, and 
I 
would have given away to my feelings and kicked up a 
row, only for the nurse, in her suggestive manner, said 
"h—s—h— 
•a• •• 
•••••••0 
To-day I 
married, so was Jones, 
Who said, quite on the sly— 
" 
Who'll be a 
happy father first. 
I 
wonder, you or I?" 
Jones always thinks he's No. 1, 
But to-day that bliss is mine, 
And when we meet, we'll have some fun, 
I'll crack a 
case of wine. 
SPOREN.—Yes, and I'll 
make Jones drink the darling's 
health, and while he's drinking I'll say, " Jonesey, old boy, 
Don't make a 
noise, S6c. 
With a 
parent's fond affection now, 
I 
feel all of a 
glow, 
But what to call the lovely babe, 
I 
don't exactly know. 
I'd like to call him something grand, 
And worthy of a 
Snooks. 
And when he's christened you must come 
And see how nice he looks. 
SPOREN.—Yes, I'll invite you all to attend the christening, 
but remember, 
Don't make a 
noise, &c.

BILLS PASTOR'S VERSION Or 
THE WORLD TURNED UPSIDE DOWN, 
Through eating too much supper before I 
went to bed, 
Strange dreams came o'er my slumbers, 
strange thoughts 
danced through my head; 
The world seemed topsy-turvy, and people of renown 
Were doing the nio.-‘7 
peculiar things— in the world turned 
upside down. 
Beech-'r 
was running a 
faro bank, while Tilton " capped - his 
game, 
Moulton was spendinz all his cash, trying the " Tiger" to 
tame; 
Edwin Booth went oil with Barnum to take the place of clown, 
While Talmadge played in - Led Astray" in the world turned 
upside down. 
The Prince of Wales he was elected Emperor of France, 
Moody and Sankey travelled round doing double song and 
dance; 
Susan B. threw off her pants and wore a 
woman's gown, 
And Henry ;7..tanley found Bill Tweed— in the world turned up-
side down. 
Brigham Younr, became a 
monk, Vic. Woodhull was a 
nun, 
Tom Thumb he joined the Fat Men's Club, and nearly weighed 
a 
ton; 
Henry Bergh he kept the biggest rat- pit in the town, 
And Don Carlos peddled peanuts—in the world turned upside 
down. 
Belknap joined the navy, on a 
gun-boat, as the cook, 
Conklin2; went to ti ,rht the Sioux along with General Crook 
In that dreamland of wonders poor Charley Ross was found, 
And Grant he 2;ot his third term--in the world turned upside 
down.

Gus_Williams_ played " Dundreary," while Sothern sang Dutch 
Hymns, 
Jay Gould took out a 
patent for making wooden limbs 
Carl Shurz was an ItaliAn, and a 
wheezy organ ground. 
And Rignold played the jewsharp—in the world turned upside 
down. 
The Democrats were voting all for Wheeler and for Hayes, 
And Bristow he went " starring" with one of Shakespea.re's 
Plays; 
Commodore Nutt fought Morrissey., 
and whipped him in a 
round , 
And John B. Gough got rolling drunk—in the world turned 
upside down, 
Clara Morris walked the t.ght rope across Niagara Falls, 
Sunset Cox he was a 
broker, and dealt in ‘• Pats" awl • Calls ;" 
In all our broad and happy land no misery could be foun d, 
For the rich divided with the poor—in the world turned up-
side down. 
Domestic life was overset, the woman rowed the boat. 
And husbands nursed the banies while the wives went out to 
vote; 
The men had all their manly forms in fancy pull- backs bound, 
While the women wore the breeches— in the world turned up-
sidle down. 
The old maids never wore false hair, nor the bachelo s false 
teeth, 
No one was known to paint to hide her yellow skin beneath ; 
No maiden ever flirted, no young men ‘• travelled round," 
For every one was virtuous—in the world turned upside down. 
Cuban hearts at last were glad, for Cuba she was free. 
And Uncle Sam and she shook hands across the briny se 
And freedom's cry shook every head that trembled ' neath 
crown, 
For every man on earth was free—in the world turned upside 
down,

Written and sung by BILLY PASTOR. 
Air.- - 
It's ll'iwkiful How We Do IC 
Now I 
hope I 
don't intrude, and you mustn't think me rude, 
If a 
question I 
should offer to suggest; 
Some philosopers do say ‘• every dog will have his day," 
And they tell us everything is for the best. 
But as I 
look around, so many things I've found 
Which seem to me quite wrong and all .. wry; 
I've noted down a 
few, which I'll ilL,w recount to you, 
I'd correct them—or I'd know the reason why. 
The papers all do state that at Washington, of late, 
Dishonesty in oflice has been found; 
There's crooked Whiskey Rings, and a 
heap of other things, 
Where bribery and thievery abound. 
If I 
was only President, I'd settle that machine. 
To rob our Uncle Sam they shouldn't try; 
For every office-holder should show a 
record clean, 
And they'd do it—or I'd know the reason why. 
In time not long gone by, we the world could defy, 
On the ocean, just us well as on the land, 
But no navy now we've got, and our vessels go to rot, 
Yes, our National shipbuilding's at a 
stand. 
If I 
but had my say, I 
would start at them straightway, 
Our mechanics, who for work do daily cry, 
And each for honest labor should have his honest pay, 
Well, I'd do it—or I'd know the reason why. 
There's Justice figured blind, the reason you will find— 
For the rich and poor a 
different law we've got; 
if a 
rich man runs away with his thousands, they will say— 
Se's absconded simply— but a 
thief lie's not I 
But let a 
poor man steal but the buying of a 
meal, 
lie's arrested, and his case at once they'll try; 
Now if I 
was but the judge, even justice I 
would deal, 
Yes, I'd do it— or I'd know the reason why. 
Another Indian war we have got to settle for, 
With the hostile Sioux we've trouble got on hand ; 
:Ft each manly heart alarms, for time Redskins are in arms, 
They've slaughtered gallant Custer and his band. 
The only way, no doubt, the red devils to wipe out, 
And safety for our settlers there to buy, 
Is to send a 
thousand riflemen, and every one a 
scout! 
And they'll do it—or they'll know the reason why.

The Girl With the Broad-Brimmed Hat, 
'Written and sung by BILLY PASTOR. 
Don't laugh—this ain't a 
comic song, 
But a 
story full of truth, 
And now, before you, you behold 
An infatuated youth. 
One evening, just like one of you, 
In a 
theatre I 
sat. 
And I 
met going out I 
tell you true, 
A 
girl with a 
broad-brimmed lint. 
I 
helped her passing through the crowd, 
She gently squeezed my arm, 
To ask her then to have ice cream 
I 
thought ' twould be no harm. 
We creamed, she told me that her pa 
Was worth a 
million fiat; 
Then I 
pitched in strong, a- making love 
To the girl with the broad-brimmed hat. 
We'd not been long together, 
When a 
stranger happened in, 
lie spoke—she introduced him 
As her gallant ' t 
Cousin Jim." 
He's related to the President, 
And I 
must tell you that 
He's a 
lostmaster away out West, 
Says the girl with the broad- brimmed hat. 
Her " cousin" ordered wine at once, 
To \\ hiichi / did not say nay, 
Cntil he handed me the bill, 
Which of course I 
had to pay. 
But when the waiter winked at me, 
As if saying " You're a 
flat !" 
I 
kind of got suspicious of 
The girl with the broad-brimmed hat. 
A 
gent, who sat at a 
table near, 
Then instantly arose, 
Says he, " I've been a-looking for you, 
To prison now you goes!" 
You burglarized the Cam town Bank, 
And now I've got you pat, 
It's Skeleton Bill, and you're his pals— 
Both you and the broad-brimmed hat. 
Next day before the magistrate 
We were all three arrayed, 
But I 
very soon convinced him 
That a 
victim I'd been made. 
Ten years in prison each they got, 
And ever after that— 
I've steered clear of all " Cousin Jims," 
And girls with a 
broad-brimmed hat.

Whin I

S:ire the divil's own crew on the dock did stand, 
And shoutin' and yellin' on every hand, 
" 
Would ye ever go home ?" Arrah whin did e

And me name in big goold letters on a

Whin there's any mild pans or kettles to mind, 
If ye have an odd job I

Words from the " Clipper,” Composed and Sung by II. A. SELINGTON. 
The people have gone crazy,

Hurrah for seventy-six, hurrah, and Yankee Doodledoo! 
Then beat the drums and ring the bells and blow the

Oh! we are mad I 
Yes, got it bad—" Centennial on the

We h-ar it gossip'd over 
In all that people say, 
While children howl ;

We get it for our dinner, 
And supper too again ; 
In fact were almost crazy,

If things don't reach a

With one big crash, we'll go to smash, 
And leave this troubled sphere.

cry, New York. 
Price 10 cents. 
I 
like to satisfy my friends. 
In everything I 
do, boys ; 
There's nothing small in me, at all, 
As a 
friend, you'll find me true, boys. 
Good nature is my only fault, 
But that you must excuse : 
Whatever you ask me, I 
shall do, 
M ., 
motto is, " never refuse I " 
CHORUS. 
I 
never refuse, I 
never refuse! 
Invite me to nine, or pour out the wine; 
Suggest what you like, or ask what you choose, 
My motto thro' life is, " never refuse ?" 
One night when coining from the play, 
My throat was feeling dry, boys : 
So I" dropped in " and a 
cork " dropped out," 
The drink was real " old rye," boys! 
Just then, came in a 
dear old friend, 
Notseen in years before; 
Our hands we entwined in a 
friendly grasp, 
And he begged me to take " just one more!" 
Spoken.—Well it would have been against my principles to 
say no, so I 
just told him plainly that— 
I 
never refuse, &c. 
I 
used to sing " My pretty Jane," 
When love's deep draught I 
swallowed ; 
And gave my sweetheart strawberry cream. 
To make myself more " solid." 
So. when I 
asked her for a 
kiss, 
She did not faint, or cry ; 
No gentle rebuke, hut a 
whisper sweet, 
And this was her charming reply : 
CHORUS. 
I 
never refuse, I 
never refuse, 
Such love and delight, how could I 
refuse! 
You may say what you like, or ask what you choose, 
My motto through life is, " never refuse ! " 
UNDER THE ROSE BUSH. 
17 
Sung with great success by Miss CARRIE DUNCAN, at Tony Pas-
tor's theatre. 
WREN eighteen years old, all(' just growing bold 
Of me cupid made quite a 
happy young bride 
By shooting his dart through, and sending my heart to 
A gentleman stranger, whom I 
had espied 
Reclining at leisure, enjoying his pleasure 
Beneath the light rose-bush full burdened with bloom 
So -kindly- he pressed me, and gently addresed me 
Remarking, look here, miss, there's plenty of room. 
CHORUS. 
Under the rose- hush. wider the rose-bush, 
Picking the clover and picking the way, 
Under the rose- hush, under the rose-bush., 
He asked me to kiss him. I 
did not say nay. 
Of modesty heedless, in fact it was needless, 
We sat by the side of that May- bedecked hedge, 
heard his confession of love and depression, 
lie asked for a 
kiss in exchange for the pledge, 
I 
never denied it, but then and there tried it. 
Beneath that bright- rose bush full burdened - it lm bloom, 
So like the May flowers, which served as a 
b(iwer, 
It seemed quite as sweet as the lovely perfume. 
Under the rose- hush. 
At sun's early dawning. I 
went there each morning. 
To meet my romantic. and strangely met swain, 
All mystery was banished, all seereev vanished 
Dear Ned vowed he'd love me again and agai
n. 
We do not like walking, we much prefer talking 
Beneath that bright rose- I , imsh,. full burdened wit I 
bloom, 
So when to the altar I 
went without falter 
I 
bad cic iit•ar Ned for a 
happy hridpwroom. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
THE other night I 
went to bed, 
In fact, I 
often do, 
And in my sleep, went down to the deep, 
Where a 
strange world met my view ; 
This world was called Concordia, 
Its people gay and free, 
I 
wished that I 
were one of them, 
Fifty miles under the sea, 
ClioRus. 
This is what I 
saw when dreaming, 
As plain, as plain could be, 
They were oh so content, they never paid rent., 
Fifty miles under the sea. 
Their food and drink wa, pure, and not 
A.dUlteratcd stuff; 
They'd no Good Templars, for they knew 
When they'd just had enough. 
They'd no  ' blues," partial to running in, 
No Divorce Court had they got, 
And they never read 
The Englishman,' 
they were a 
happy lot. 
CEO Br S. 
This is what I 
saw when dreaming, 
As plain, as plain could e 
They'd ne'er had an '• Odger," no claiman t" Sir Roger,'; 
Fifty miles unuer the sea, 
They'd never had a 
national debt, 
They never were troubled with wars, 
They never had a 
man for the rates 
Come knock, knock, knock at their doors; 
The toothache, income tax, and corns 
They knew not—happy souls! 
Of railway smashes they'd ne'er heard, 
Nor the price of a 
ton of coals.

MY PRETTY LITTLE KITTIE. 
[Copyrighted, 1875, by A. J. FISHER.] 
An Original Serenade, with Songs and Dances. 
and Composed by T. M. RENGLER. 
! 
Riffle, you're so lovely 
To night, I 
came to see 
Your face, divinely pretty, 
A 
smiling down on Inc ; 
In visions, dear, you cheer me, 
Where'er I 
chance to stray ; 
If sleeping, dream of me, love, 
Before I 
go away. 
CHORUS. 
Good Night! Good Night! 
Sweet dreams, my love! 
Good Night! 
Good Night! Good Night! 
Sweet dreams, my love! 
Good Night! 
Written 
My pretty little Kittle, the dearest one to me, 
The fairest and the only one I 
love ; 
Every Eve we sit together, 
'Neath the Sycamore tree, 
'Neath the nest of a 
pretty little dove, 
She sings to me so sweetly. 
The songs I 
love to hear, 
The music and the words. I 
know them well; 
She charms me so completely, 
When she finishes each verse 
I 
kiss her, and tell her not to tell. 
Good Night & G. 
She's ray pretty little Kitths,. 
And my little flower of joy. 
I'm as joyful as the birds 
That warble in the trees ; 
My bliss, like theirs, without alloy ; 
When our wedding-day is over, 
I'll live among the clover, 
With this pretty little flower of joy. 
Away with all your Belles, 
None with mine can compare; 
My Kittie—my love—my life— 
The Queen of all the fair! 
Away with all your Belles, 
None with mine can compare; 
My Kittie—my love—my life— 
The Queen of all the fair !

LsYmpl 
It fills me with delight, on a 
full moon starry night, 
To walk with my pretty Kittle dear ; 
And vow to her such love as only lover's might, 
To the one whom they dearly revere. 
Last evening we were walking 
Where the moon did brightly shine. 
I 
asked her, there, to be my own dear wife ; 
She answered, yes, so sweetly, 
'Neath blushes fair and rosy— 
Our happiness shall ever be most rife.

DON'T YOU DARE TO DO IT GEORGE, 
A:, sung by ToNY PASTOR. 
I 
COURTED once a 
lovely girl. 
A beauty young and fair, 
She'd cherry red lips, and teeth like pearl, 
And golden was her hair, 
Her eyes were like the evening stars, 
That shine in heaven above, 
And with this lovely beauty 
I 
was overhead in love. 
SPOKEN.—I 
shall never forget the first time I 
met that girl— 
never—no never, and when the time came to bid her good 
bye, you know that time ahvays collies, although it comes 
rather late with some, and rater early with others. 
We were 
early lards that ti:ne - early in the morning you know. 
So, 
I'd gone through all the preliminary ceremonies, such as good 
bye, darling, and pleasant dreams, and I'd just slided may arm 
around her waist and was going to give her one good kiss 
right square on the mouth, when she boxed my ears and said : 
cnoit us, 
•• Don't you dare to do it, George, 
Don't you dare to do it, George, 
"If ' twas found out, what would my mother say!' " 
Don't you dare to do it, George, 
Don't you dare to do it, George 
Ain't you a 
very, very, naughty man 
I 
took her for a 
walk one night, 
'Twas in a 
flowery dell, 
And while there, to my fair one, 
I 
tales of love did tell, 
She sat down in a 
shaded spot, 
I 
sat down by her side, 
And with my arm around her waist 
I 
said, ' darling, be my bride," 
mokAirmigAlisi. 
81 
SPOKEN. —" 
I 
says tcr her, says I— " Susan," says I 
— says I— " Susan," says I—. 
Darned if I know what I 
“id say now ; but I know I 
said it, yes I 
did, and when I 
showed her the ring, and asked her for her answer, she said: 
"get away George, you're always saying something," that 
means yes, yes it does, so I 
says to her, says I. I'll go and have 
our names put in the morning papers, and then I'll go to the 
minister and have our names called in church next Sunday, 
George so-and-so. and Miss Susan so-and-so, to be joined to-
gether in holy wedlock, any one having any objections will 
please state them or forever after hold their peace, and my 
Susan actually swooned over in my arms, yes she did ; and 
when she came to herself the very first words she uttered were: 
Don't you dare to do it, George, etc. 
Well I 
need not tell you more about 
Those happy nights we met, 
For soon we put olIcourting, boys, 
And married we did get, 
And now I 
feel so happy, 
Oh my heart is filled with joy ; 
For yesterday my Susan dear 
Brought forth a 
little boy. 
SPOKEN. — Yes, its the prettiest little baby you ever saw. 
Oh 
girls do come and see it ! all the girls in the neighborhood have 
been to see it, and they sly its the handsomest child they ever 
saw— the very picture of its father. 
I'm its father; yes I 
am. 
By the by, boys. before I 
go I'll let you into a 
little secret, on 
the quiet you know. When you take your sweetheart out for an 
evening's promenade and you want to kiss her good bye at the 
door, and she says. " don't you dare to do it," that's the time you 
must. 
They only pretend to be a 
little shy, why bless your 
souls after they're married their shyness and bashfulness all 
vanish just as quickly as a glass of lager in the hands of a 
thirsty Dutchman. Why, since I've been married, I 
don't remem-
ber, not even once, my Susan ever saying : 
Don't you dare to do it. George, etc. 
(ANSWER TO " 
You've Been a 
Friend to Me.") 
As Sung by ED. SCULLY. 
Ah years have come and gone, dear Tom, 
The past seems like a 
dream, 
When you and I 
together met 
By the winding stream. 
When hand in hand we promised, Tom, 
To each we would be true ; 
Old time has made no change in me, 
I'm still a 
friend to you. 
Cmmus. 
I'm still a 
friend to you, dear Tom, 
Alas! there are but few 
Have ever been as kind and true, 
As I 
have been to you. 
How often have I 
wept, dear Tom, 
When thinking o'er the joys 
The happy scenes of long ago, 
When you and I 
were boys; 
But now I'm told, you're very poor, 
Your days in life are few ; 
It gives me joy to meet you, TOM. 
I'm still a 
friend, ctc. 
Old friendship often withers, Tom, 
Whene'er a 
man grows poor; 
The rich and proud forget old friends, 
And know them then no more; 
But keep that honest heart of yours, 
We'll make old friendship new; 
I 
care not what the world may say, 
I'm still a 
friend to you.

To my darling I 
will always prove true, 
And look on her with a 
smile of love; 
Like a 
sunbeam she's beautiful and bright, 
With eyes like the little stars above. 
She's the fairest in all creation, 
Pretty Peggy, charming creature, 
Pretty Peggy, darling loved one, 
Ah ! she's like a 
little bird in the spring. 
When you're in her company for a 
while, 
Just look at her curly jet black hair! 
Her face is always brightened with a 
smile, 
Faith, none with my jewel can compare. 
She's the fairest, Sre. 
The day is coming when I'll wed this pearl, 
The thought of it cheers me on my way; 
The bells will ring, and the colleens will sing. 
When she names the happy wedding day.

THE HAPPY PAST. 
Words and Music .by Cniunn. DE HAVEN. 
Sung with 
Great Applause, by CHARLES HOWARD. 
The months are quickly passing by, 
Old love returns anew ; 
The scenes of youth bring back a 
sigh, 
For friends that once were true. 
Long years have passed since first we met, 
Old age is creeping on; 
But the happy past we'll ne'er forget, 
While memory holds its throne. 
Chorus.—Long years have passed, &a. 
In youthful days the Sun shone bright, 
And stars like silver fell : 
To be with thee ' twas my delight, 
Thy image kept the spell. 
Thy gentle words and loving smile, 
Like incense on the air, 
Were Heaven to me, for all the while 
Thy image breathed a 
prayer. 
Long years have passed, dm. 
In trials dark, and midnight gloom, 
When sorrow rends the breast, 
One thought of thee will cheer me on, 
And lull my soul to rest. 
I 
ask but this as years go by, 
Be true as in days of yore ; 
4nd when life's task shall end with us, 
We'll reach a 
brighter shore. 
Long years have passed, &e. 
THE ACTOR'S GREAT BALL. 
An Original Song by FRANK Lnwrs. 
As snug by him 
with Great Success. 
A 
comical story I'm going to tell you. 
I 
wrote it to please both tee great and, the small; 
It's about some good fun I 
had in this City, 
One night at the Actor's Professional Ball. 
The first set of Quadrilles was danced bj Tony Pastor, 
Of which Clara Morris the figures did call. 
Mr. Daly and Pique waltzed round faster and faster— 
There was fun, you can bet at the Actor's ,':re tt Ball! 
Josh Hart brought his Eagle to 11v at the party, 
John Brougham a 
kiss from Miss Neilson he t
ook 
Lester Wallack, he shaved off ids whiskers, and gave them 
Unto the two Orphans ot Sheridan Shook. 
Mr. Levy, he played on his Corn , 
t, a 
Solo, 
As he sat in the Crucible of Oakey Hall! 
Pat Rooney and Harry Bennett, to enliven the meeting, 
Danced the Trada-loo, at the Actor's Great Ball. 
Jennie Engle appeared with her fligs used in singing, 
And Sol Smith Russell commenced 1w to blow. 
Harry Hill's Female Boxers went in to fling him. 
To the place underneath, where all Actors do go. 
Then Kclly and Leon went in rough and tumble, 
Tore Leon's new dress, which cost thousands, he'll say. 
Gus Williams got his steam up and bursted his b 
Toler, 
And John Hart, the skeleton, he fainted away. 
Billy Pastor then tried to waltz with Miss Markham, 
But his body was lar e 
and his legs they were small— 
So he got the two Brahams to drop all their H's, 
They tripped up Jennie Hughes, her sweet vocals and all. 
Anna Dickinson then danced, her crown of thorns wearing. 
Which gave to the critics an unmerciful shock. 
While Jarrett & Palmer made Tooker keep swearing— 
There was no boat afloat like the great Plymouth Rock! 
As daylight approached, the fun kept increasing; 
Mr. Theodore Moss called his Jockey a 
fool— 
Then Boucicault came in with a 
play he had stolen, 
And closed up the da'; lights of friend John F. Poole. 
Just then occurred what you would call a 
commotion; 
Kate Claxton had Fannie Davenport Pinned ,gainst the wall. 
Harrigan Ft Hart then appeared in their unequalled effusions, 
,And that put an and to tho Actors Graat Ball!

THE MUSEUM IN THE PARK. 
Entered according to the Act of Congres7g, in the year 1874, by A - J. 
FisliErt, in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
IN the Central Park you may see ' em, 
The wonders I'll describe to you, 
For New York's got the finest museum, 
If you search the wide world thro' and thro'. 
There's the nose of the cavalry horse, 
Which a 
Dutch soldier took great delight in, 
And thqtail of the Kilkenny cat, 
The only part that was saved from his fighting. 
CHORUS. 
Then a 
tig! for each foreign museum! 
If you want just to enjoy a 
lark, 
Why ! the zreatest of wonders you'll see ' em, 
In the building that stands in the Park. 
There's the memory of Dowlimr, the Judge, 
The snout of the great Count Johannes, 
The sword of brave Sarsfield, who fought 
'Neath the fold of old Ireland's green banners. 
There's the cent that old Vanderbilt gave, 
The first in his life to a 
beggar, 
There's a 
drop from a 
new made perfume, 
More powerful in scent than a 
nagur, 
Then a 
fig, & c, 
There's a 
conductor that never could cheat. 
A 
driver that refused his whack, 
A 
waiter girl, not on the beat, 
And a 
poet with a 
coat on his back, 
There's a 
model of Nelse Seymour's Leg, 
A 
garter from Barnum's fat lady, 
A 
German could not drink a 
keg, 
And a 
wife that did not wish a 
baby. 
Then a 
fig, &c. 
There's a 
laboring man got his pay, 
From Green, when his day's work was over, 
And a

In return for his great Alabama.

Sung by HARPER 
STANEIL. 
I 
MET the maiden that I 
loved 
One even on the ea, 
And, save a 
peeping star or two 
All by ourselves were we. 
While ' round abou', the merry mothst 
Were dancing in the air, 
Yet softer on my shoulder fell 
The flutter of her hair. 
And so we walked an hour or more, 
How swift the moments sped, 
And then we parted—sad the day, 
What might I 
not have said. 
Cuoans. 
To the maiden that I 
loved, 
In rapture was I 
led, 
My heart was all aflame for her, 
What might I 
not have said. 
I 
met the maiden that I 
loved 
Once more in after years, 
And as I 
passed her in the street 
She. 
scarce could speak for tears, 
For by her side a 
stranger walked 
And she might be his bride 
But ohl she looked not as of yore 
While yet the village pride. 
Her eyes were swollen— very red, 
She staggered on her way, 
'Twas a " Fly Cop" had her, so they said, 
Taking her to quay, 
CHORUS. 
So now I 
think of her I 
loved, 
In rapture was I 
led, 
lly heart was all aflame for her, 
What might I 
not have said.

A 
fair little creature who by the by. 
At coaxing and teasing had such a 
nice way; 
Now every night to her house 1 
went, 
In harmless delight our evenings were spent, 
But she had a 
queer saying, whatever it meant, 
For whenever I 
entered her house she would say 
8.poken—Charley, dear, before you take a seat, won't you 
please• go and.

Though we're alone, hear this in mind,

One night, for a 
change, to the theatre we went, 
And when we got home she was very content, 
She saw them make love, and so learned the way, 
The piece was - Claude Melnotte," and suited her fine ! 
She called me her rose-bud, her duck and her dear, 
She threw her arms round me, while fast fell each tear; 
She cried, oh, don't leave me, for sadly I

You don't love me truly, say, will you be mine?

THE SLIGO MUSKETEERS. 
Words and Music by HARRY BENNETT. 
Written expressly 
for TIERNEY tt CRONIN. 
Oh, let ye stand from under now and open wide your ears, 
While we relate the story of the Sligo Musketeers ; 
Sure, whin we landed on this soil out West thay made us go 
And we worked at canalling in the State of Oh-ho-ho. 
But when the war it did break out it took our job away, 
We organized a 
Company and what into the fray ; 
We fought the ragged rebels, boys, for many a 
weary day, 
But they could'ut bate the Sligo Musketeers. 
CHORUS. 
With our ha, ha, ha, ha, hayfoot, straw, we marched across 
the plain. 
And many's the time we thought we'd thought we'd never 
see our homes again ; 
The rebels fought like devils, but their fighting was in vain, 
For they could'ut bate the Sligo Musteteers., 
We fought wid Banks and Burnside, and wid Grant wt 
took a 
hack, 
But the best of all, though he was small, our gallant little 
Mac ; 
Faith I 
if they'd let him have his way, he'd surely drive 
thim back. 
If assisted by the Sligo Musketeers. 
Sur:), he knew how to Engineer, likewise to command; 
No matter what your station was he'd take you by the hand. 
He looked so noble on his horse when he was in command 
Of us fighting boys, the Sligo Musketeers. 
With our ha, ha, &c. 
But now our lave of absence, boys, is very nearly spint, 
We'd ax you all to take a 
ball, but we're without a 
cint; 
On Erie shares, and all such snares, our money it is lint— 
It completely broke the Sligo Musketeers. 
We'll say Good Evening, one and all, your pardon, too, 
we crave, 
We did our duty, manfully, this country for to save; 
May the Shamrock and the Stars and Stripes in triumph 
ever wave, 
O'er the fortunes of the Sligo Musketeers.

rare amusement for young ladies and gentlemen. 
Read what two 
leading New York papers say of it: 
The N. Y. Evening Ilail writes: 
" 
A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. FISHER'S, 98 Nas-
sau street ca led the • Little Flirt." We cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady ;obi gentlemen readers. as we think it would only 
encoarage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining " how. when and 
where to do it.' and this little volume would advise and initiate the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. _sf. Eeeaing Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a neat little 
book, bound in Morocco leather, emtimg twenty-fivo cents, called the 
" 
Little Flirt," published by A. J. [ mama, No. ea Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the modus op , randi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
is nothing at all objectimabla in the volume, and its contents might af-
fol d 
some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recom-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."

Co 
tir1 int; Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want f: equently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be nen-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, n 
hint: might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and beieg in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
