Buttercups and Daisies. 
Recited by DAISY REMINGTON. 
When a 
little boy I 
wandered, ' twas a 
pleasant summer's 
day, 
My heart was like a 
feather, as I 
journeyed on my wayii 
To my eager footsteps soft the green grass laid, 
With a 
little playmate, such a 
tiny maid. 
Playing I 
was poor man, playing she was rich, 
How her merry laughter reached the highest pitch ; 
Pointing to the daisies' silver wealth untold, 
Buttercups unnumbered—these, she said, were gold. 
With the time departing, soon the air was chilled,' 
Out upon the crisp wind loud the robin thrilled ; 
Once again I 
wandered, with my little maid, 
To our treasure garden, vast in wealth arrayed. 
Soon we knew a 
robber, Jack Frost was his name, 
had been there before us and taken all our gain ; 
\Vith his icy fingers, and a 
grasp so cold, 
Stole our silver daisies and buttercups of gold. 
Man's estate I 
reached then, but I 
ne'er forgot 
My little maid companion and our treasure spot ; 
For there was a 
lesson in our strange belief— 
Summer was our banker, winter was our thief. 
So it is with friends, then, sometimes so with all, 
They're true to us in sunshine, but leave us in the fall .P 
'When a 
warm friend slights me, or he treats me cold, -
I 
think of silver daisies and buttercups of gold. 
The Apology to O'Reilly. 
Not a 
hundred yards from where I 
stand, 
In this our glorious Union land, 
Is kept a 
first-class whisky stand 
By a 
man whose name's O'Connor. 
There's a 
man who's known both near and far 
Who tends to Mike O'Connor's bar ; 
Who in our late war received no scar— 
[is name it is O'Reilly. 
Beneath our starry banner's wave 
There's not a 
man fought half so brave, 
Or half the money for whisky gave 
As did Mr. McDermott. 
O'Connors bar-room blazed with light 
On that eventful bloody night 
That McDermott had a 
fearful fight 
With O'Reilly. 
With sleeves rolled up McDermott stood, 
And vowed he'd die before he would 
Say the slightest word that could in any manner be 
misconstrued 
Into an apology to O'Reilly. 
With a 
frowing brow and flashing eye 
O'Reilly collared a 
glass of rye, 
Which he devoured without a 
sigh ; 
Then turning to McDermott, said : 
" 
You alcoholic vat, you drunken loon, 
You've no more brains than a 
gossoon." 
" 
Be heavens, I'll make you change your tune !" 
Says McDermott. 
McDermott went for O'Reilly's nose, 
And on it planted fearful blows 
Till o'er his eyes a 
shanty rose, 
Erected by McDermott. 
O'Reilly fell into a 
swoon, 
With his head jammed in a 
big spittoon, 
nd dreaming of Barnum's big balloon, 
i'he police came in and collared the gang. 
Written by DAISY REMINGTON, and dedicated to H INES and BLOSSOM 
I'll sing of a 
blonde I 
met one day, 
While walking on the street, 
She was dressed in the very latest style, 
And what darling little feet ! 
As 
tripped along she shyly glanced 
At me with her lovely eyes ; 
I 
made my mind up then and there 
That she should be my prize. 
CHORUS. 
She's sweeter than the violets in the spring time, 
Or the lilies as they bloom so pure and white ; 
No rose can compare with her in beauty, 
She is more to me than heaven's own sunlight. 
I 
called on her, at her request, 
She met me at•the gate, 
We talked about so many things, 
Ere I 
lefi itswas growing late. 
But I 
had mustered courage up, 
And asked her for her hand ; 
She says she has loved me from the first, 
I'm the happiest man in the land. 
She's sweeter, &c.

Old Uncle John. 
Words by Ell. FERRIS, expressly for, and sung by, DAVE Wit.sox. 
Oh, good evening, white folks all, 
I 
thought I'd make a 
call, 
And tell you how the old man he gets on. 
I 
will try and please you all, 
Both fat, short, lean, and tall, 
\Vhile there is dancing in old uncle John. 
Though I've often been told, 
This nigger's getting old, 
And soon will go into the happy land; 
But as long as I 
do live, 
And got a 
step to give, 
There'll be dancing yet in old uncle John. 
That's what the old man wants to do. 
When I 
was in my prime 
I 
had many a 
happy time 
With the colored boys down on the old plantation. 
And when our work was done 
Oh, we all went in for fun, 
I 
tell you ' twas a 
happy population. 
But my bones are getting sore, 
And I 
cannot work much more, 
And soon this poor old nigger will be gone. 
But as long as I 
do live, 
And got a 
step to give, 
There'll be dancing left in old uncle john. 
That's what the old man wants to do. 
Now white folks, I'll take my leave, 
And I 
hope you will not grieve, 
For the old man will come back some other night; 
And he'll tell you something new, 
And show what he can do 
In the way of getting a 
dance up right. 
So, good-by, all my friends, 
For this nigger now intends 
To go off to his home and be gone. 
And if I 
gain your applause, 
I'm sure ' twill be the cause 
Of real happiness to old uncle John ; 
That's what I 
want you all to do. 
Out of Employment. • 
RECITATION . 
W ritten by DAN SULLY for Miss DAISY REMINGTON, and recited by her 
with great success in the principal theatres. 
Out of employment, starvation in view, 
Now what has a 
poor man in my place to do ? 
Weary I 
wander, careworn and sad, 
I'm looking for work, and there's none to be had. 
Choosing rather to die than to beg or to steal, 
The sharp pangs of hunger I 
try to conceal; 
Weary I. 
wander, sadly I 
roam, 
To earn food for the little ones starving at home. 
Vain, vain are those tears, but still they will flow, 
To yield to despair is womanly, I 
know; 
I 
must choke down the lump which will rise in my throat, 
And strive to live on, though I 
have not a 
groat. 
Yes, I'll strive to live on, though again and again 
Does the mad thought of suicide flash through my brain ; 
Dinnerless, supperless, still I 
must roam, 
To earn food for the little ones starving at home. 
Now, why should a 
man, be he Christian or Turk, 
Be. 
doomed to such hardships while he's willing to work ? 
For months I've been wandering half crazed through 
your town, 
Till my strength is nigh gone and I'm quite broken down. 
Oh, God ! it were better, perhaps, to be dead, 
For they won't give me work, and I 
can't beg my bread, 
No money, no work, sadly I 
roam, 
There's no help for lie little ones starving at twine. 
Johnson's Little Whirl. 
Written and song with great success by DAISY REMINGTON. 
There was a 
bang-up party 
held the other night, 
Down at Jimmy Johnson's, 
The boys they all got tight. 
Each ticket gave a 
gentleman 
Admittance with his girl, 
To have a 
little racket 
At Johnson's little whirl. 
CHORUS. 
There was Curly Jim, the barber, 
And Charley New, the " mash," 
And all the colored waiters 
Got off from slinging hash. 
There was ginger beer and whiskey, 
Arid gin too " straight " to curl ; 
And all the gang got paralyzed 
At Johnson's little whirl. 
The old man he got " cranky," 
And tried so hard to talk, 
lie got exasperated, 
And was told to take a 
walk. 
Ben Blake he drew a 
razor, 
And tried to " carve " his girl, 
But he got floored by another coon 
At Johnson's little whirl. 
'There was Curly Jim, &c. 
Darling Isabel. 
As sung with immense success by the original PARKER SISTERS, Liam 
and GEORGIE. 
I 
feel as happy as a 
lark flying through the air, 
The reason why, I'm deep in love with a 
maiden fair, 
With laughing eyes and cheeks like rubies, lips of rosy hue ; 
The dearest girl I 
ever saw, a 
violet dipped in dew. 
I 
love her, and I 
promised her her name I'd never tell, 
I 
will not, but I've christene&her my darling Isabel. 
CHORUS. 
She's the only one I 
love, (Sym.) 
Like a 
twinkling star, above. ( Sym.) 
The fairest flower I 
ever knew in a 
sunny dell, 
Its beauty sweet could ne'er compete 
With my darling Isabel. 
Now 
it seems to the that I 
have seen that young man here before, 
I 
think I 
saw him talking to the girl that I 
adore. 
But she is dead in love xvith me, this fairy queen divine, 
This beauty fair with golden hair, with face and form divine. 
Oh a 
favor she has asked of me, her sweet name not to tell, 
So 
content with calling her my darling Isabel. 
She's the only one, & c. 
FIRST— 
Now there's a 
young man that's in love with Isabel, my beau, 
But she, I 
know, don't care for him, so I 
think you'd better go. 
SECOND— 
Young man, I 
called on her to- day. and found my love at home, 
I 
asked her if she would be mine, thro' life with me to roam. 
Ft RST— 
And she told you no, for we're engaged, though I 
promised 
I'd not tell. 
SECOND— 
Well, then, my boy, I 
wish you joy with darling Isabel. 
A Parody written and sung by DAISY REMINGTON. 
I've a 
letter from your pappy, 
Baby mine, baby mine ; 
He has treated us quite shabby, 
Baby mine, baby mine. 
Ile has gone to old Kentuck, 
lie has left us in hard luck, 
And our trunks for board are stuck, 
Baby mine, baby mine, 
Oh, what shall we do for chuck,baby mine? 
He has gone to old Kentucky, 
Baby mine, baby mine ; 
But we ought to feel quite lucky. 
Baby mine, baby mine. 
Ile has left his last year's coat, 
We will put it into soak, 
And not be entirely broke, 
Baby mine, baby mine, 
And we'll catch another bloke, baby mine. 
We will buy him no more beer, 
Baby mine, baby mine ; 
Ile has skipped off on his ear, 
Baby mine, baby mine. 
lot won t 
we make him cry, 
If to find us he does try ? 
We will give him a 
black eye, 
Baby mine, baby mine, 
We, will starve him on custard pie, baby mine. 
The Boxing Match. 
Written by DAISY REMINGTON. 
There was a 
boxing match, 
Was held the other evening 
At Pat and Mike O'Callahan's, 
At number sixty-four. 
The gang they all were there, 
To see a 
friendly set-to ; 
They took me in and played me for 
-A dozen rounds or more. 
CHORUS. 
'Yes, they played me for a 
sucker, 
I 
came out with a 
black eye ; 
They hit me in the smeller 
And knocked me in the cellar, 
And I 
thought I 
was in the 
Sweet bye and bye. 
There was Bill McGann, the tough, 
And O'Donovan, the bruiser, 
Put on the gloves and started out 
To pulverize the gang. 
I 
thought I'd take a 
hand, 
So I 
chasseed up between them; 
Be heavens, I 
thought, I 
never see 
The light of day again. 
Yes, they played me, &c.

Monday Night at the Show Shebang. 
AIR : " Sunday Night, when the Palor is Full." 
Words by DAISY 
REMINGTON. 
My Johanna is a 
masher, 
And she acts out every night ; 
Oh, the smiles she casts among you 
Will make your head feel awful light. 
serio-comic singer, 
And she tries to catch the gang ; 
She wears a 
short dress, and flirts a 
fan, sure, 
Monday night at the show shebang. 
CHORUS. 
She gets one hundred dollars weekly, 
In every place she ever sang ; 
She buys tickets for all the gallery, 
Monday night at the show shebang. 
My Johanna sings so charming 
" 
Captain Cuff" and " My Mary Ann," 
On the Isle of Blackwell she's been farming 
With " Muldoon, the Solid Man." 
She can eat six " dozen raw," sure, 
And drink Heidsick without a 
pang ; 
Sleep all day, and the next night, boys, 
She'll make up all new for the show shebang. 
She gets, &c. 
Kissing in the Moonlight. 
As sung by Miss GRACE GARLAND. 
There are many pleasures spoken of 
fly all, both young and old ; 
There are fishing, boating, parties, too, 
And picnics, I 
am told. 
But of all the pleasures there is none— 
I'm sure you'll say I'm right— 
As to place your arm round her you love 
And kiss her in the moonlight. 
CHORUS. 
She's as ehandsome as a 
lily in the summer, ( Sym.) 
I'm proud to tell you all that I 
have won her. 
Of all the pleasures spoken of— 
I'm sure you'll say I'm right— 
Is to place your arm round her you love 
And kiss her in the moonlight. 
I 
met her first one summer's eve, 
I 
raised my hat and. said : 
•' I 
pray, dear miss, may I 
beg leave 
To ask you if you'll wed?" 
She raised her eyes, and sweetly smiled, 
It filled me with delight ; 
So I 
placed my arm around her waist 
And kissed her in the moonlight. 
(sym.) 
She's as handsome, &c.

Hurrah for the man with a 
shilling a 
day, 
And hurrah for the man with two; 
Hurrah for the man with a 
thousand a 
year, 
And who's got no work to do. 
Hurrah for the man with five hmsdred thousand pounds, 
Whoever he may be, 
And hurrah for that man if he makes his will, 
And leaves it all to me. 
Ono. 
For he is the man for me, my boys, 
He is the man for me, 
If he left me every dollar, I'd ne'er be out of a 
collar, 
So he'd be the man for me. 
Hurrah for the coon who never feels queer 
When he goes upon the sea; 
hurrah for the party, with a 
heap of poor relations, 
But who never a 
one does see. 
Hurrah for the l 
mnpecked husband, who 
Don't wish he'd single tarried, 
And hurrah, hurrah for the jolly old maid 
Who doesn't wish she'd been married. 
Cnonus. 
For she's the old maid for me, my boys, 
That's the old moid for me, 
Who don't want man to cheer her, or to come a 
little neure:, 
Then that's the old maid for me. 
Hurrah for the man who never kicke,1 
A 
poor unlucky Nvight when he's down; 
Hurrah for the man with a 
cheerful heart 
Who hasn't got a 
cheerful crowr. 
Hurrah for the man who never backs 
A 
horse but what ho wins; 
And hurrah for the honest working man 
Who's the father of a 
half dozen twins. 
Cnonns. 
For he is the man for me, ray boys, 
lie's the man for me, 
The ffiend of emigration and a 
surplus population, 
So Ike is the man for me. 
IInah for the wife who has always a 
smile, 
And who's not always wanting a 
new bonnet; 
Hurrah for the man with a 
jovial face, 
And a 
jolly good nose upon it. 
Hurrah, hurrah for the dear, dear girls, 
May their charms be never less; 
And hurrah for the man who lends a 
helping hand 
To another in distress. 
CHOLUS. 
For he is the man for me, my boys, 
He is the man for me, 
And if you like this lay, then I 
am bound to say 
That you are the men for me.

Well there. now 
lid you ever ? 
Ma says Bin dreadful bold 
Because when men come ccurtmg, 
liii _ ot resery'd '
Jr cold. 
Now, gents, pray tell me, would you have me 
Make a 
face that's wry ? 
Or when you ask Inc once to kiss you, 
Like a 
fool to cry ? 
SPOKEN.—No, no! I'm sure you would rather I'd say — 
Cnouns. 
Keep on kissing me, keep on kissing me, 
Bless me, Bob, don't be so shy; 
Keep 011 kissing me, keep on kissing mu, 
Once more only love to try ; 
Keep on kissing me, keep on kissing me, 
'Tis the height of true love's bliss ; 
Keep on kissing me, keep on kissing me, 
No joy equals love's fond kiss. 
Bob says not to mind mother, 
When she was young like me 
She ne'er tho't men a 
bother, 
Or married would not be ; 
And so I 
thought if men would follow, 
I'd not say them nay. 
Nor for my mother, or any other, 
Bid them turn away. 
SPOKEN.—But I've made up my mind that when the right one 
comes along, 111 say — 
.414i 
think that Bob means business, 
Tho' not much yet he's said, 
But truly, from his actions, 
I 
think he means to wed. 
Now should he ask inc if I'll have him, 
I'll not bid him wait, 
And say the sea holds plenty fishes, 
For oft we lose our bait. 
SPOKEN.-011, yes, I 
tell you, these giddy girls who keep 
flaying, " There's just as good fish in the sea as ever were 
caught!" they forget that sometimes they lose their bait. 
Not 
for me! 
Oh, no! 
I'll continue saying  
Keep on kissing me, etc.

THE young men's social club 
They gave a

They had a

From Manahan, 
Two barges and a

The lads were titivated; 
Yes, lit for sweet diversion.

She played the concertina 
As through the wood we'd rove 
I 
was all alone with Kitty MeChun 
Up at Dudley Grove. 
I 
danced in every set; 
Ta the waltz how gay I'd wheel her, 
No pi voter could equal her, 
A 
darling and a 
dear; 
And as we'd spin around 
They'd say, ' Ain't she a

Then I'd ta-ta up to the bar 
For a

She'd reach the upper C.

Like my own, my bonny Mary, 
She's a

She's the lass that captured me.

VIE ONE THAT I 
LOVE BEST, 
Written by J. J. MCDERMOTT, for T. M. ITENCILER. 
know a 
110o maiden, fair and sweet, 
With an eye of gentle blue; 
Her golden tressses, like waves and sunshine, 
And a 
cheek of rosy hue. 
Down in a 
little cottage, where roses bloom, 
And the robin builds his nest, 
Their dwells this little mAiden, fair and sweg— 
She's the one that I 
love best. 
Clionus. 
Down in the meadow by the stile, 
When the Sun goos down the West., 
She always meets me with a 
smile, 
She's the one that I 
love best. 
Her name T 
need not tell to you 
This little maid, with eyes so blue, 
For I'm as happy as a 
King; 
With her my life is blest ! 
She is my only guiding star— 
The one that I 
love best. 
When the little stars twinkle from slymi, 
And the Moon pePps o'er the hill, 
We wander ' neath the old oak trees, listening 
To the music of the rill ; 
Or stroll amid violet's sweet perfume. 
When the birds have gone to rest : 
And watch the fading twilight gently fall, 
With the one that I 
love best. 
Down in the meadow, .141. 
Oh ! Often I 
have told her I 
loved her, 
And she's told the same to me ; 
And we have often promised each other 
That we will constant be. 
While sitting at the door last Sunday Eve, 
Ikr head upon my breast ; 
In sweet and loving words, I 
got the hand, 
Of the one that I 
love best.

PARODY ON GRANDFATTIER'S CLOCK. 
Composed and sung with great success by Andy Collura. 
My grandfather's nose was as red as a 
beet, 
And lo• used to hang around in the yard, 
Get chuck 1„11 of gin around t.) l'atsey Flynn's, 
With the gang he was always playing earths, 
They stuck him every game and tiny called for the same, 
So the old guy got chuck full of booze, 
They would lay htimmi on the chairs, stick feathers in his cars. 
While the old butts was taking a 
snooze. 
CIIORUS. 
Thirty years he's been living on gin, gin, gin, gin, 
The neighbors around the corner say it 
a 
d sin,sin,sin,sin. 
But he stopped, quick, never to get drunk again, 
When his mother-in-law fired him out the door. 
Cuonus. 
! 
My grandfather's watch was too large for 
his pockets, 
Never, Ah 
never again shall I 
see 
them, 
Over the wild world, an Outcast I 
roam, 
Never, Alt ! never again shall I 
see them, 
Over tit 
wide world an Outcast I 
roam. 
Once I 
had father, and mother, and sister, 
Once I 
had all that a 
man's heart could crave; 
But they have gone now, and deep is my sorrow, 
Quiet they rest in the cold, silent grave; 
What care I 
now— friendless ant I. 
Cheerless my heart— deserted my home, 
Never again shall I 
know aught of gladness 
Over the wide world, an Outcast I 
roam, 
Never again shall I 
know aught of gladness, 
Over the wide w,r1d, an Outcast I 
roam. 
Never, Alt! never again, etc. 
So he used to bang it up on the wall, 
Whenever he got broke of course he would go, 
And give rncle Simpson a 
call, 
lie would ask five or ten, or whetever they would lend, 
To the rum shop he would steer right away, 
Get full as a 
brick, next morning he was sick, 
While the super in the pawn shop it did lay,

I:tumorous Recitation by ED, ItAinirodil 
CHEESE pards, I'll give it out straight 
flow I 
dropped down to a 
bum, 
Don't lay it altogether, rocks, 
On whisky, gin and rum. 
Put some of it to good nature, 
I

did, 
They said I 
was a 
good feller 
have a

his't no more this year, 
Go in and get your load, 
But don't say 1 
gave you a 
steer. 
I'm agin ' cm shure, bet on me, 
On the avenue or in a 
cellar, 
I've drank enough to swim a 
ship, 
That's when I 
was a 
good fellow. 
You're young, fresh, full of chin, 
You've got to keep up your lick, 
There's a 
way to get out of it soon, 
There amt much need of a 
kick 
Stay home and study figures, 
I 
t's an old thing for me to bellow, 
studying Hoyle was solid for me, 
That's wnen .t 
was a 
good fellow, 
gother's sick, au, that's tough. 
You say you're her only kid, 
Don't use the old woman rough, 
Might get a 
stepmother instead. 
If you amt flowing I'm lying. 
You start like a 
steam propeller, 
Boy, you'll (to a 
heap of that crying, 
if you stick to being a

It conic from being a

Save money, you'll get a

What, Inc ? I'll get long, don't worry.

A 
Contradiction. 
" 
The mill will never grind again 
With the water that has past." 
A maxim of the olden time 
That will forever last. 
This theme, in verses written, 
Preaches a 
sermon to all ; 
But critically weighed with wisdom, 
How does the lesson fall ? 
The m:11 upon a 
slope cloth stand, 
It bears an antique shape ; 
Waters from the mountain-land 
Seem happy to escape, 
And, rushing by the old mill's wheel, 
Causing it to grind, 
Bound madly on the vale beyond, 
A 
level there to find. 
The race now o'er, with calmness 
Into a 
lake the water flows, 
And, mingling with the tranquil flood, 
Seeks peace in sweet repose. 
The bright sunbeams then visiting 
This realm to Somnus given, 
The tiny globes in vapors rise 
To space above in heaven. 
Once in air, they congregate, 
Fantastic clouds to be, 
And, wafted by the summer breeze, 
Float off most gracefully. 
Soon the mountain tops are reached, 
Ere they cling for rest ; 
Each rued peak is hid from view, 
Each in vapor dressed. 
At morn the clouds would fain ascend, 
And leave this dreary plain ; 
But, chilled through by the frigid air, 
Condensed, they fall in rain. 
As the pearly drops alight, 
They dance about with glee, 
For are they not of earth again, 
Just as they used to be ? 
They prance, they skip, and race along, 
O'er pebbled brook and rill— 
When lo! they reach familiar ground, 
And pass the same old mill. 
In doing so they turn the wheel, 
With sparkling spray o'ercast, 
Thus proving that the mill does grind 
With water that has past. 
Philosophically the lesson's taught, 
Bidding us beware, 
Although a 
chance unheeded pass, 
Not to incite despair. 
Labor on with redoubled zeal, 
Lost hours to redeem, 
And teach your conscience thus to feel, 
That things are what they seem. 
Opportunities appearing lost, 
And numbered with the slain, 
By providential agencies 
Will surely come again. 
Now bear in mind, although the Fates 
Your hopes continually blast, 
Kind Nature's mill will grind again 
With watet that has past,

Reep your eyeballs moving, 
And watch the time of day, 
The Skidmore Guards have joined together, 
To give a 
ball on West Broadway! 
But I

And takes a

THE OLD VILLAGE SCHOOL ON THE 
GREEN, 
Written by FRANK VAN HESS for ED. BURTON, and sung by him 
with great success. 
Oh ! I 
love the bright days of my youth to review, 
And fancy t!gain I'm a 
boy, 
With my merry companions so faithful and true, 
And friendship that knows no alloy. 
Oh ! the thoughts I 
review as I 
ponder the past, 
Recalling each dear youthful scene ; 
The one I 
most prize, and will love to the last, 
Is the old village school on the green. 
(Repeat two last lines.) 
Near the old village school the cottage still stantis, 
Where I 
first saw the dawn of light; 
And now over its porch in rich clustering bands, 
The roses are blooming as bright 
As ' twas when with garlands and wreaths of will flowers, 
We joyously crowned our May Queen, 
And told childish love tales in neat little bowers, 
Near the old village school on the green. 
(Repeat two last linos.) 
I 
have left many dear and some loved ones behind 
To rest as I've journeyed along; 
There are others remain just as faithful and kind, 
To join in the laugh and the SODIr; 
And when I 
am called by grim death to prepare, 
I. will answer with spirit serene, 
)7 they'll lay me to rest when I 
breathe my last prayer, 
Near the old village school on the green.

Her mother was his early love, 
her sire his boyhood's friend, 
And when they pass'd away, their child, 
The old man vow'd to tend. 
She was the sunshine of his home, 
A 
rose so bright and fair, 
With all her mother's loving ways, 
Her eyes and golden hair, 
Her eyes and golden hair. 
What wonder to his lonely heart 
Crept back the loveof old, 
But autumn may not wed with spring, 
lie cherished it untold ; 
But autumn may not wed with spring, 
lie cherished it untold. 
One day there came a seemly knight, 
To woo her from his side, 
The old man smiled upon him, 
For her sake, his joy an , pride, 
His joy and pride. 
But fickle was the knight and falm,

Doing something for other folk's pleasure, 
To trouble and care I'm a

They will have me there if they can, 
I'm always secure of a

I'm such an agreeable man.

Oh , he's such an agreeable man. 
I 
can sing a 
good song, so they tell me, 
And sometimes I 
play on the horn, 
Play poker and whist like an artist, 
Tho' oft of my cash I 
get shorn. 
At the table my health's ne'er forgotten, 
But, the boys shout as loud as they can, 
Oh, ain't lie a 
jolly good fellow, 
And such an agreeable man. 
I

dance, Sc 
When I 
fall in with nice, pleasant people, 
Like those I

I 
strain ey'ry nerve to amuse them, 
And my task is both happy and light; 
Then each one can copy my maxim, 
And make it your eY'ry da',' plan, 
As you toddle through I 
fe avoid care and strife, 
And be an agreeable 111an.

To the sway of happiest dreams, 
Back to scenes of beauty glances,

When Mont Blanc foretells the day ;

My golden-hair'd darlings, disturb not their rest, 
Sweet Angels have lull'd them to sleep on my breast; 
O'er their calm slumbers a 
vigil they keep, 
My babes feel no hunger while buried in sleep. 
Whene'er they awake, my fond heart, in its dread, 
Grows sick in the fear that I 
cannot find bread 
To give to my dear ones, so please let them rest; 
While Angels are watching them, slumber is best. 
CHORUS. 
Tread softly, speak lightly, disturb not their rest, 
While Angels are guarding them, slumber is best 
hunger is bitter, while slumber is sweet, 
Wake not my darlings, they've nothing to eat. 
Lull them to rest! lull them to rest! 
Lull them to rest! lull them to rest! 
They say there is plenty and peace in the land, 
And that charity gives with a 
lavishing hand; 
Notwithstanding that church spires point to the skies, 
Wealth fattens on plenty, while poverty dies! 
There's one, by whose aid the sparrows are fed, 
And I've prayed unto him for our daily bread; 
I 
feel that I'm going my Saviour to meet, 
Where I'll not see my darlings want something to eat! 
Tread softly, ete, 
DISSOLVING VIEWS. 
Composed and sung by GEORGE /TARRTEL 
Ara. — Castles in the Air. 
While thinking of some past events at home tho other night, 
-;cated .at my cheerful fire, which then was burning bright, 
At list the fire began to fade—a 
shadow o'er it grew ; 
I 
fancied I 
was looking at some great dissolving view ; 
Soule views there were that gave me joy, while others gave 
me pain ; 
Oh ! may 1 
never see them in reality again ; 
So give me your attention, and I'll quickly tell to you 
Sonic pictures that I 
witnessed in my great dissolving view. 
The first view was of sad distress, a 
truly wretched case ; 
The family of a 
workingman hunger stared them in the face 
The mother and their children gather'd round a 
scanty fire, 
The last sparks even threatening every moment to expire; 
At last the father enters, and hangs his honest head, 
And silently he shares wIth them his last loaf of bread, 
'Iltough honest, he is forced to steal and into jail he's threw ; 
'('his sad and truthful picture is my second dissolving view. 
The next was a. 
police court ; two prisoners in were led ; 
( 
Me, a 
well-dressed swindler, and the other a 
boy ill- fed ; 
The boy had stolen, and confessed his guilt, and for pardon 
did entreat. 
Ile said, " I 
am an orphan boy, and nothing had to eat; 
Three months hard labor was his doom—the tears ran 
down his face; 
While he who swindled many a 
man walked out with P. 
good grace; 
Ho paid for counsel with his spoil—his money put him 
through— 
That ends the case, and he gets free in this dissolving view. 
'I he third it was a 
murder cold a 
tragic one, I'm sure ; 
It was a 
man of manly heart, and a 
good friend to the poor, 
Shot down by an assassin, dastardly and cold ! 
But shooting men quite unawares is the fashion now, I'm 
told; 
The murder of Jim Fisk, I 
mean. a 
man known to you all. 
In this wide world he played his part. and rolling kept the 
' 
ball ; 
I 
hope his spirit's gone aloft, I 
most sincerely do, 
Ever more .to rest in peace. in this dissolving view. 
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG 
As sung by LIZZIE BRAIIAX. 
Just list to my song, and I'll not keep you long. 
For I've only a 
few words to say ; 
For from what I 
can see, most things scent to mo 
To be going in a 
very strange way. 
Just point out, I 
might, the way to tle right, 
lint I 
then should be jeered by the throng; 
So, go on your own way, you'll find out some day, 
When toe late, that that's where you're wrong, 
Yes I 
I 
tell you all, that's where you're wrong. 
Of the girls of the day, I 
most first have a 
say, 
You don't mean to tell me it's right 
They should dress as they do, for excepting a 
few, 
Each one to my mind looks a 
fright. 
That vile Grecian bend, does me much offend, 
Then again, there's that nasty chignon; 
I 
think they look vile, but if you like the style 
I 
tell you all, that's where you're wrong, 
les! I 
tell you all that's whole you're VVrang. 
With the girls I've not done, now just find me one 
'Who would make a 
young man a 
good wife, 
And not gad about, and be always going out, 
Thus causing him oother and strife 
I 
tell you you can't for a 
good one there arn't, 
To be picked out among the whole throng; 
I'm right, I'll be bound, there's not one to be found, 
If you think there is, that's where you're wrong, 
Yes I 
tell you all, that's where ytu're wrong. 
Sung by the Fox SISTERS. 
Ant.—All Among the hay. 
The first years of our matrimonial life, 
considered extremely delicious. 
But lately my charming and dutiful wife, 
You appear to ho very suspicious ; 
I 
cannot walk out by myself half a 
mile, 
Or cline with a 
few hearty fellows, 
But a 
frown on your face takes the place of a 
slink, 
You've grown so excessively jealous. 
SPOKEN. — And why, Sir ? 
You go out with the boys, Sir ! 
You go out with the boys. 
Drinking champagne all the night, 
And kicking up a 
noise. 
You go out with the boys, Sir, 
You go out with the boys! 
Instead of being home with me, 
You go out with the boys! 
AIR.— Up in a 
Balloon. 
Suspicious you say, no wonder indeed, 
Your conduct's outrageous. 
[HE.] 
Go on Ma'm, proceed, 
Your manners are charming and lady-like, quite. 
SITE. 
You may sneer qs you please, Sir, but you know I'm right, 
It's lucky my temper is even and mild, 
Remarkably so, quite the style of a 
child, 
A 
temper like yours, when your tongue is unfurl'd, 
Would make a 
man wish himself out of the world. 
Up in a 
balloon, Ma'am, up in a 
balloon, 
There's where I 
shall wish myself, 
Believe me, very soon. 
Up in a 
balloon, Ma'am, 
Up in a 
balloon! 
I 
should get a 
little peace, 
If I 
was up in a 
balloon! 
AIR. — I'll meet thee in the Lane. 
[SHE.] 
You promised to be at home Sir, at six to dine, 
Instead of that you come at half past nine. 
[HE.] 
Allow me to explain love, 
And then you'll not complain, love ; 
Business detain'd love, 
'Till the clock struck nine! 
[SHE.] 
Not business, Sir, but pleasure. 
The home you once did treasure, 
You come to at your leisure, 
And wish me to believe 
That business could detain you 
'Till half past nine. 
If that is your excuse, Sir, I 
must decline 
To hear another word Sir, 
Such quibbles are absurd, Sir. 
Why cannot I 
convince this wife of mine?

We are very often told, 
All that glitters is not gold, 
And we're not as we all ought to be; 
And you'd quite believe it true,

When I

Oh, my I 
what a 
pious world tins is, 
And how very good we all seem to be ; 
What a 
duffing lot you find, 
If you only raise the blind, 
And see us on the strict " Q. T." 
Old ladies oft declare, 
Girls should never wear false hair, 
The locks that once adorned another she, 
Or to use that lily-white; 
But they draw the curtains tight, 
And use it on the strict " Q. T." 
Oh, my etc. 
With a 
lady when you dine, 
And you ask her to take wine, 
She says " I 
couldn't touch it," not for me ! 
Say " Mum's the word," make haste! 
And I 
think you'll find she'll taste, 
That " mum " upon the strict " Q. T." 
Oh, my! etc. 
Just take a 
pretty miss, 
And offer her a 
kiss, 
When there's anybody standing by, to see, 
She'd say she'd rather die, 
But you may snatch it on the sly, 
And she'll like it on the strict " Q. T." 
Oh, my etr, 
The Itussians in the Rast, 
Were preparing for a 
feast, 
They meant to carve the Turkey, don't you see? 
They said, " It's peace were on," 
But their little game was Con-
Stantinople on the strict " Q. T." 
Oh, my I

Each girl a 
little puff, 
Will in her pocket stuff, 
She cannot do without it, all agree, 
And her pretty little nose she'll powder, 
When a 
moment is allowed her, 
To do it on the strict " Q. T." 
Oh, my! etc. 
When Sunday comes you fear, 
You can not get your beer, 
It's forbidden in the city of the free, 
It's naughty, but its nice, 
But if you ask for " Weiss," 
You'll get, in on the strict " Q. T." 
Oh, my! etc. 
Now, there's the needy swell, 
Who calls a 
girl'gel!," 
Wears an Ulster quite a 
yard below his knee. 
Then comes the ancient beau, 
Upon whose cheek there is a 
glow, 
That we think is on the strict " Q. T." 
Oh, my! etc. 
Composed ny HARRY BENNETT, and sung with success by BILLY 
CARTER. 
Oh, love is such a 
very funny thing, 
And it catches the young and the old, 
Hs just like a 
plate of boarding-house hash, 
And many a 
man it has sold. ---
It makes you feel like a 
fresh water eel, 
And causes your head to swell. 
You lose your mind, for love is blind, 
And it empties your pocket-book as well. 
CHOWN. 
Boys keep away from the gals, I 
say, 
Give them lots of room, 
Or you'll find when you're wed, 
They will bang you till you're dead, 
With bald-headed end of a 
broom. 
When man is gone on a 
pretty little gal, 
lie talks just as gentle as a 
dove; 
He spends all his money, and calls her his honey, 
For to show her he is solid on his love. 
When his money is gone and his clothes in hock, 
'Ho finds the old saying it is true, 
That a 
mole on the arm is worth two on the leg, 
But what is ho going for to do. 
Voys keep away, ell% 
When married folks have lots of cash, 
Their love is firm and strong, 
But when they have to feed on hash 
Their love don't last so long.

When your butcher comes around to collect his bill, 
With .a

Boys keep away, etc. 
Voting fellows just take my advice, 
Don't be in a 
hurry for to wed, 
Nrolt think you're in clover till the honey- moon's over, 
And then you'll think you're dead. 
With a 
cross-eyed baby on each knee, 
And a 
wife with a 
plaster on her nose, 
Vo l 
had true love don't run so very smooth, 
When you have to weal: your second-hand clothes. 
Boys keep away, etc. 
When the rent is high, and the kids all cry 
Because there's no grub to chaw, 
You'll holler for your son 
To load up your gun, 
While you vaccinate mother-in-law. 
WHY AM I 
LEFT SINGLE? 
NvritteD by C. Ii. W1TT.

Sling by miss JENNIE ENGEL. 
011 ! why Mil I 
left single at the age of twenty-two, 
A proposal I 
have never had, oh ! dear what shall I 
do, 
My bashfulness the better of my judgment I'm afraid 
lye allowed to get, and fate seems bent on calling me old maid; 
It's not because I 
have not tried, of that I 
feel assur'd, 
And aware I 
am that, sweethearts cannot always he procured; 
But when I 
see companions, some, too, plainer than myself,. 
All going or it seems a 
shame to leave me on the shelf. 
C1IORUS. 
Yes, here I 
am left single, 
In this cold NVOI*1(1 to mingle 
Without the smile or warmth of love divine. 
At 
1(1 any gent who lonely, 
A true heart searching only, 
Would very much oh ii 
oh lige by trying mine. 
For every Jack there is a 
Jill, at least so poets say, 
I 
sometimes think the poets wrong, in their peculiar way; 
I 
think it likely that the Jack's more wide awake may be, 
Anil yet there seems a 
blindness in their overlooking tne; 
sing, I 
dance, I 
play, I 
draw, to which I 
can annex, 
Accomplishments most usual appertahling to my sex; 
And thanks to schools .of cookery, where lessons I 
could take, 
I'm sufficiently domestic now, to cook or pastry make. 
Then why am I 
left single, 3,7.c. 
Oh ! is it that I 
cannot boast of wedding portion great, 
Or riches, such a 
bye-road to the matrimonial state; 
If so, let inoney-hunters go, for I 
am very sure, 
That men who marry but for cash their love must be impure; 
No, hetter far be as I 
am, than link'd in hymen's chain, 
With one NVI10 selfish pleasures take and will not share the pain; 
I 
hit wity sing thus pathetic, when our life is but a 
trance, 
In truth I 
want to change my name, but have not had the 
chance. 
TAKE back the heart that thou gayest, 
What is my anguish to thee ? 
Take back the freedom thou cravest, 
Leaving the fetters to Inc. 
'rake back the vows thou hast spoken, 
Fling them aside and be free, 
Smile o'er each pitiful token, 
Leaving the sorrow to me. 
Drink deep of life's fond illusion, 
Gaze on the storm cloud, and flee 
Swiftly thro' strife and confusion, 
Leaving the burden to me. 
Then when at last overtaken, 
Time flings its fetters o'er thee, 
Come, with a 
trust still unshaken, 
Come back it captive to me, 
Come back in sadness or sorrow, 
Once more my darling to be, 
Come, as of old, love- to borrow 
Glimpses of sunlight lrom in 
Love sbP11 resume its dominion, 
Striving no more to be free, 
When on the world's weary pinion 
Flies back my lost love to me. 
TAKE IT BOB, 
Sung with immense success by MISS ALECIA JOURDAN. 
ni a

I've a

nice little lass, 
I'm fowl of her too, and l'm fond of my glass. 
Perhaps I'm too fond they say, that may be, 
I 
try to be merry, awl am as you see; 
But if I

Take it Bob, take it Bob, take it Bob, take it Bob, 
That's what I 
fancy my mill seems to say; 
Take it Bob, take it Boll, take it Bob, take it, 
'fake it Bob, take it, its better than tea. 
I 
dreamt tother night that Bob Bull was no more, 
I 
I

And I 
heard the folks ' round me say, " drinks done its 
worst.' 
..1nd although Fwas was dead, I 
was dying with thirst. 
A lii le of brandy close by I 
could see, 
"fwas meant for the mourners, It was'nt for inc, 
Awl as on my bed still and silent I 
lay, 
In the distance distinctly I 
heard my mill say— 
Take it Bob, ,Ve. 
Now I'm only up here for a 
bit of a 
spree, 
My Pa thinks its business between you and m 
e, 
But you know the old saying that never deceives— 
What the eye does'nt see, the heart never grieves. 
I 
must toddle at once, so good- by to you all, 
Perhaps soon again I'll give you a 
call; 
Now don't ask inc to drink before I 
go away, 
Or I'm certain to fancy I 
hear my mill say— 
Take it Bob, a:t.

DAN COLLYER'S GREAT ACT. 
One of the first prisoners under examination was a 
youth, 
who had been arrested at the instance of a 
respectable negro 
man of family, for having " rocked " his house and severely 
injured his daughter with a 
stone thrown through the window. 
At the examination Old Pompey was put upon the stand, and 
proved the charge in such undeniable terms that it would 
have gone bard with the prisoner had it not been for the fol-
lowing cross-examination : 
LAWYER—You say one gton 4 
came into the room where 
you were sitting with your family, and struck your daughter ? 
POMP— Yes, boss. 
LAWYER—Where did it strike her? 
POMP (
silent for awhile)--I 
don't like to tell, boss. 
LAWYER—But you must tell. 
I 
tlemand again, Where did 
it strike her ? 
POMP—Dat all foolishness, boss. 
I 
tell you it hit her. 
I 
don't like to tell where ' fore dese people in court. 
LAWYER— But you must answer. 
Where did it hit her ? 
POMP (slowly)—On the buzzum, boss. 
LAWYER—Well, how severely did it injure her? 
POMP—Oh, quit dis foolishness. I 
ain't gwine to tell. 
LAWYER—Again I 
must insist upon my question being 
answered. 
Did it injure her ? 
POMP tin despair)—No, sah ! 
It did not injure her, but it 
broke three lingers of a 
uentleman that was payin' ' tendon 
to her. 
COMMON kerosene, Collyer says, is a 
sovereign cure for 
rheumatism. 
If the rheumatism is in your leg, all you have 
to do is 
t ) rub on the kerosene, and then light it with a 
match. 
Add Ilyman's Celebrated 4th of July Oration, 
It is useless and more than foolish to enter into prefatory 
remarks explanatory of the origin, growth and pedigree of the 
Fourth of July. 
That it was born of poor and honest parents, 
is a 
fact known iJ.). us all. 
That it's birth gave us freedom there 
can be no doubt. 
That that freedom inspired us with enter-
prise and industry make no blooming error. 
That industry 
and enterprise has made us the greatest nation the sun ever silotv 
on, you can bet your bottom dollar. 
And in how short it time? 
How rapid have been the strides of improvement. 
Rivers that 
but yesterday rolled from the icy north to the tropicA 1 
south, 
whose surfaces were only disturbed by the Indian's canoe, to-
day are full of Ilat-boats and stern- wheel-steamers. 
In the lan-
guage ol the Poet— 
Behind the redman's bark canoe, 
The steamboat puffs and raves, 
And city lots are advertised for side, 
Above old Indians' graves. 
Hey! 
Where was triis city two hundred years ago? 
Where was it ? 
Was it where she now stands ? No, my hearers, it was not. 
pit, 
on this spot the war-whoop of the Indian chief might have been 
heard to echo and reecho Irom Woodbine Cottage to the Jersey 
Ferry. 
But where is the war-whoop now ? 
It has passed into 
the dim distance, and to-day as you walk down Broadway 
instead of being greeted with the war- whoop of the Indian 
chief, all you hear is: 
How is the old thing working? 
But 
we know how it is ourselves. 
We know that as a 
people 
we are huge. 
We have everything to be proud of. 
We have 
a 
President that can smoke more cigars, make longer excur-
sions and shorter speeches, catch more trout and allow the 
American Flag to ask more apologies than any other ruler on 
the face of the earth. 
We have men in our Halls of Congress 
who would sacrifice their lives rather thav rob the government of 
anything,—They couldn't get away with, and if we keep on 
progressing as Nve have been in the last few years, there will be 
nothing left of the Old Constitution but the Freedmen's Bureau, 
Woman's Suffrage and the 15th Amendment. 
Ain't we huge? 
I 
tell you we're business. We're the most peaceful when abused 
and the most warlike when let alone of any people on the earth. 
We had a 
standing challenge in the Clipper for years and years. 
No nation took it up, so we took it up ourselves. 
We had a 
light in our own family just to show outsiders how we could 
make the fur fly. 
But the cruel was is over and how our hearts 
beat with joy, our bosoms heaved with emotion to see our 
brothers and friends after their long, tedious marches and hard 
fought battles, returning home—from Canada. 
Yes, my friends, the war is over and the Star Spangled Banner 
still floats triumphant. 
We still celebrate the Anniversary of 
the Declaration of Independence. 
And the bald-headed etede 
his perched himself on the snow-capped stumnits of the Mocky 
Rountains, flapping his wings, spreading his tail feathers, bid-
ding defiance to the world and spiting for a 
muss. 
But he'll 
never sidle, he's not long to wait. 
We are on the eve of a 
great war, which if not stopped will cause rivers of blood to 
flow. 
I 
fancy I 
hear you asking yourselves, what will cause 
this war ? 
1 
will tell you. 
During the last three years there 
has been more emigration to this country than there has been 
during the last three years. 
Scarcely a ship arrives but that 
brings from twenty-five to one hundred Italian organ- grinders, 
sent to this country by Italy to make harmony between the two 
great nations, but how are they treated, how are Italians treat-
ed in this country ? Calumniously. Have we commissioners ap-
pointed to show them around, to take them by the hand and 
guard them against the pitfalls and allurements that beset their 
path to lead them astray ? 
No, in Italic, No 
Why it was only 
two days, three weeks and four months ago that an Italian 
friend of mine, an organ-g,Thaler by profession, landed in this 
your beautiful city of New York. How was he received ? Who 
was there to take hini by the hand and show him round among

What

tie stood grinding his organ three 
days and three nights, in front of a 
Deaf and Dumb Asylum. Its 
enough to bust up any business. 
And it is likely to cause war 
be,tween this country and Italy. 
Let us prevent it, " Let us 
have peace," for, as Gen. Grant says, the country is in no con-
dition to fight and he wouldn't say so unless he Wit,3 paid for 
it.

American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is the old-
est and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We have 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arranged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each of these into K for King, Q 
for Queen, 
sad K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an, 
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S. 
Enclosed in handsome case 
Price 25 Cents. 
Courting Cards.— This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such 
way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by 
-_, tlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
, 
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

Read what two 
leading New York Papers say of it: 
The N. Y. Evening Mail writes 
" 
A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. Fisnan's, 98 Nas 
sau street, called the " Little Flirt." We 
cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of" flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any furthernecessity of explaining "how, when and 
where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the...un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a 
neat-rale 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
" 
Little Flirt," published by A. J. 
FISHER, No. OS Nassau Street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the mean-
ing of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As 
there is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents 
might afford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to 
recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."

abided by, or been ruled by the answers of this Oracle. No further lib-
erties have been taken in the translation, than merely to adapt it. the 
usages of this coun,try. 
The questions being more numerous, and the 
answers more divIrszfled than any edition ever before published in
