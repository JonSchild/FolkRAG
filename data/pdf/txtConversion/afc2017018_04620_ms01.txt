I: 
All right. Ready? 
P: 
Ready. 
I: 
All right. The first thing I want to do is say thank you for agreeing to this interview. 
P: 
You’re welcome. 
I: 
And thank you for the work that you do ‘cause we think it’s very important work, and we want to let the 
rest of the world know how important it is through your stories. So, we’re going to start with your story about 
how you got into this kind of work, when, why, and I also want to hear about the miracle child. 
P: 
Okay. That, well, that’s sort of a pretty good segue [1.18.22]. I am a Miracle Network Child from 1989. I 
was born with a bone disorder that like 1 in 10,000 people have. I have a fairly mild case of it. It’s called 
Hemihypertrophy, which basically my right side grew—when I was growing—my right side of my skeleton grew 
faster than my left side, and in order to fix that they broke the bones in my calf and inserted pins and a halo 
and stretched me out basically. And I was kind of a guinea pig because they were not sure if my brain would 
catch onto the fact that it needed to speed up the growth on the left of my body or if they’d have to come back 
and break my femur when I was older. So, but it did catch on, luckily. I never had to go back, and the Miracle 
Network Foundation paid for my surgery, basically, which would have been a lot for my family to bear 
otherwise, and the nurses that inspired me to want to become a healthcare worker during my time in the 
hospital, they kinda made my stay. Like my family was there for the majority of the time, but occasionally I’d be 
left alone and the nurses that were friendly and helpful with me made me not feel like I was alone. So, that had 
an impact. 
I: 
You want to become a nurse? You’re already in the process? 
P: 
Yes. I’m in the process of being a nurse. I have one semester left. 
I: 
And the work that you do now is helping to— 
P: 
Yes. Definitely. Preparing you for working with people. I mean there’s definitely—you’re working with all 
varied ages when you’re a nurse but working with the elderly that’s also a very common part of nursing, and I 
think caregiving is hand-in-hand with nursing. 
I: 
How long have you been doing the personal care work? 
P: 
Mmm. I have been caring for M for a couple of months, and before that I cared for my cousin’s 
grandmother here and there, and I have also worked in a long-term care setting [1.15.39] with Alzheimer’s and 
dementia patients. 
I: 
Okay. And, right now, you have the one client. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
You have M. 
P: 
M. Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And what is it you are doing for him? 
P: 
Well, when I go over there I am helping to take care of him with his activities of daily living. I’m, you 
know, we’re waking up and getting changed and brushing his hair and making sure he’s brushing his teeth and 
feeding him and all that good stuff, but also, I think a big part of it is I try to be their friend. I mean I think that 
the way that you approach people in the caregiver type role really—you could have a good day or a bad day

just based on what you’re bringing to the table, and if you develop that relationship with them where you are 
bringing good things to the table, they’re gonna be happier to see you, and more willing to get up and exercise 
when they need to, and more willing to cooperate rather than want to be grumpy and stay in bed, and it’s 
important that you get along with the people that you’re caring for [1.14.01]. 
I: 
So, how do you go about developing that relationship? 
P: 
With M? I know that he is a lover of Spanish music, and so I’ve got on my phone—I’ve created a 
Pandora channel that’s M, and I watch as the songs come on, and if I see his lips moving along with, you 
know, the words to the song, I know that that’s a song that he recognizes, and I thumbs up rather than thumbs 
down, and [laughs] it’s—I don’t know. I don’t particularly know that much Spanish music, but it’s definitely 
something I’ve enjoyed listening to with him, and just, you know, coming with a positive attitude and saying 
good morning with a smile rather than, it’s time to get outta bed, like, [snaps her fingers]. I don’t know. 
I: 
So, there’s more to it than just the technical skills. 
P: 
Oh, yeah. You’ve got to be personable otherwise you can run into a lot more trouble than you would 
otherwise. 
I: 
Have you ever had that experience? Can you illustrate? 
P: 
Well, I—I mean sometimes you can’t help but have that experience. Some days the person you’re 
caring for is in a bad mood or they’re under the weather and you get snipped at, and you just kinda gotta give 
‘em their space for a minute and then come back and try to turn it around I guess. You don’t hold on to—like, 
try not to bare grudges against people [1.12.20] that you’re caring for, obviously, ‘cause that would be not a 
smart path [laughing], I guess. For example, last week I went over there, and M was in bed, and I tried to get 
him outta bed, and he was kinda fightin’ me about it. He was still wantin’ to sleep for a little while longer and I 
tried to swing his legs towards the side of the bed just to get him to like—motivated to get up, and when I 
swung his legs he was like—feeling like I was being too controlling or something of his actions, and he kinda 
was like, “Hey!” And got after me and kinda kicked his legs back up on the bed, and I was like all right. I’m 
sorry. I shouldn’t have tried to move you when you weren’t movin’ on your own. I’ll give you like 20 minutes and 
I’ll be back. And he’s like, “Eye yi yi.” And he says, “All right.” And I leave him, and I go back 20 minutes later, 
and now I’ve brewed his coffee so he can smell the coffee coming from the other room, and got a little 
something ready for him for breakfast, and then I come back, and then I can tell him, you know, now, I’ve got 
your coffee on the table, and it’s got—you wanna catch it while it’s still warm, and give him some little 
motivation to get out of bed rather than just come and say, get! It’s time, type thing. 
I: 
Did that work? 
P: 
It did work. Yes. He got up and he enjoyed his coffee, and actually was like, “Ey it’s too hot!” So, it took 
a little. We added some cream I think that day, even though he doesn’t normally drink it with cream [1.10.41]. 
I: 
So, there’s a lot of sort of figuring out what situation is gonna work best? 
P: 
Right. And it’s getting to know the person that you’re taking care of because everybody’s got their 
personal preferences, and as much as you can provide to, like, allow for their personal preference, you know, 
that’s something that they’re gonna appreciate. 
I: 
Does he speak Spanish with you? 
P: 
I do not speak very much Spanish, so he will—I mean I speak pieces, so I can sorta understand when 
he does choose to speak Spanish to me. I sorta—but sometimes I have to be like, what is that word? And then 
he’ll just laugh at me and tell me the English word for it, so he’s pretty good about translating for me when he 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Rachel Esch. 6.27.18

does—‘cause sometimes he does just naturally slip into Spanish, and when that happens I gotta be like hold 
on. You’re talkin’ to me now - who you think you’re talkin’ to [1.09.40] ‘cause I would need a translator [laughs]. 
I: 
So, my understanding is that he does have some dementia? 
P: 
Yes. He [pause], he is aware of who he is, and for the majority of the time the people that are around 
him right now, but he’s not real consistent with when it is. And the days that he remembers his wife is gone are 
especially sad. 
I: 
Can you explain that or tell a story around that? 
P: 
Yes. There was one day that we were listening to music, and there’s this band that he was—Mexican 
trio—which is fairly popular Los Poncho’s, and they sing a song called Sinte, which means without you, and I 
guess it was a song—C was tellin’ me—C, which is his daughter, was tellin’ me that when her mother was very 
near to passing away that he had sung that song to her, and it was basically like without you, how do I go on 
type song, which is, you know, that’s super sad. And so, we were listening to that song, and he was like—
mentioned his wife, H, is her name, and he’s like, “Where is she?” And I didn’t really know what to say to that, 
and—‘cause I was not sure if it would be helpful to reorient him and just cause him a painful day or whatever. 
But C was there, and she, you know, replied to him honestly, ‘cause she tried to be honest with him [1.07.41] 
as much as she can. So, she reminded him that she had passed several years ago, and he just got this 
stunned—“My wife, you know, my H has passed?” And it was like he would recall, and then like a little bit a 
time would go by and he’d see this little crinkle come across his brow and he’d come back to it. “H’s dead?” 
And that was just so—it’s a kinda double-edged thing. Like it’s painful for him to remember, and it’s painful that 
he doesn’t remember at the same time, but that was a sad day ‘cause he was pretty—he was pretty emotional. 
He would—like when they were confirming, yes, that she’s passed, he’d have his little cry for a couple minutes, 
and it was all you could do to just kinda, you know, I’m sorry. It’s terrible. You don’t know what to tell ‘em 
because she’s been gone for years, but it’s like it’s fresh for him. 
I: 
So, that begs the question about training, and have you had any training in terms of different kinds of 
dementia and what to expect? 
P: 
Yup. I took a CNA program, and I’ve had my long-term care rotation in the nursing program, and that is 
a lot to deal with, you know, dealing with the elderly population that has Alzheimer’s and dementia, and, yeah. 
But you know, there’s also, like with her, like—okay. Let me find my thought here [laughs]. The reorienting 
thing, they say it’s not—when I was trained about it, they say it’s not really the best thing to do. That older 
people that have the Alzheimer’s and dementia don’t necessarily always need to be reoriented to reality 
because it’s just painful for them, and confusing, and causes them, you know, stress and anxiety and things 
that are just generally not good for ya to be stressed for no reason. But then you’ve got personal preferences. I 
mean that’s his family, and you know, a little choice that they made there, which is, you know, I understand it. 
It’s fine. You don’t wanna—I don’t know—almost feels like not answering him truthfully is like denying 
something of their mom, and that’s, you know. I don’t know. It’s complicated, and I feel like I got on a tangent 
there and maybe didn’t answer your question [laughs] directly, but— 
I: 
You did. 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
You did. The training that—you have had - CNA training. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
So, you’ve learned how to do all of the technical skills and— 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Rachel Esch. 6.27.18 
 
3
P: 
Right. The transferring. 
I: 
Transferring. 
P: 
Just—I don’t know. I guess it’s kinda stuff I take for granted like if they’ve got dentures, cleaning the 
dentures, and providing, you know, giving their medication and all that fun stuff. 
I: 
So, you just said it’s stuff I take for granted, which is interesting because some of the PCAs that we 
have interviewed, I ask them to just describe what they do for somebody. “Oh, you know, we just get ‘em ready 
for the day.” When really if you break it down— 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
--there’s a lot more to it than just you and I getting ready for the day, right? 
P: 
Oh, yeah. 
I: 
If you could give us a little bit more detail? Like, you’re getting them ready for the day. What does that 
actually mean? 
P: 
Well, like I said I’ve kind of learned about getting stuff prepared for him on the table so that he’s got 
some little motivation to get up out of bed because that also seems to smooth things over a little bit. Usually 
when I get there I go in and I, you know, he’s most of the time asleep, so when I get there at about 10, and I’ll 
just come up and kinda touch his leg or his foot or something and be like, M? And then he sees me, and this 
morning he gave me a big ole smile, and he’s like, “Oh, how you doing? It’s nice to see you,” and I’m like, hi! 
I’m gonna hang out with you today. Like it’s time to get up for breakfast if that’s all right with you, and we 
usually head to the bathroom first, and I’ll get him—depending on how he feels, I will either take him to the 
table first for breakfast or get him changed into his day clothes. Sometimes he wants to change into his day 
clothes after or before breakfast, and I usually just go with whatever he’s feeling like [1.02.22]. And, yeah, and I 
help him to the bathroom, and then once we’ve eaten breakfast I usually get him to brush his teeth, and make 
sure, you know, his hair’s all combed and everything, and after breakfast I usually try to get him to do some 
kind of exercise. If I can get him up and walking around the kitchen or the living room that’s kind of—that’s 
good. I prefer to get him up and walking, but sometimes he doesn’t feel like that much energy, so they got 
this—it’s like a bike but not. It’s just the pedals, and he can use that on the ground, and we’ll go sit in the living 
room and watch—I’ll put a show on and I’ll put his feet in the pedals and he’ll just—he’ll pedal for a good, you 
know, 15, 20 minutes or then I’ll put it up so he can do it with his arms, because it’s important to keep that arm 
strength, you know, you don’t want him to lose really any of his strength so that he can keep as much of his 
independence as possible, and then sometimes we’ll play poker, which he constantly beats me at or checkers, 
which he pretty much always beats me at too. I’m not very good [laughing] at some of the games that he likes 
to play, but I still enjoy playing them with him. And we’ve got other little things that we’ll do for his legs—
dexterity. She had a balloon at one time, that we would just kinda set at the kitchen table and like tap back and 
forth to each other, just gets his arms up and movin’ around, and it’s kind of like a little bit of exercise for him, 
but also, you know, just good hand-eye stuff. And you know, making him lunch. He gets lunch somewhere 
between noon and 2, which I just kinda depends on where his hunger’s at for the day, and makin’ sure that he 
gets his pills in the morning and the afternoon. And he usually takes a nap for about an hour somewhere in the 
afternoon time, and that’s when I’m usually doing like dishes and whatever, cleaning up the mess that we’ve 
managed to make in her house so that I don’t feel terrible about leaving her a mess. And usually I try to feed 
him dinner before I go, sometime we are going out on the porch, get some sun and enjoy the weather ‘cause 
he does enjoy being outside [59.39]. That’s usually kinda about it. 
I: 
I’m still struck by you’re so nonchalant about, oh, yeah, I get ‘em some breakfast, and then I get him 
dinner [laughs].

P: 
Yeah. He’s gotta eat. It’s convincin’ him to eat that’s a little bit a work sometimes. It seems like— 
I: 
I mean what would you say to somebody who said, well, how hard can it be to fix somebody dinner? 
P: 
I mean. Okay. So, fixin’ dinner means that I’ve gotta get him stationed somewhere where I’m not 
worried about him because M needs someone to be around when he’s up and walking because he has—I 
mean he’s not probably gonna fall on himself, but he is unsteady, so safety first. You wanna be near him when 
he’s up and walking around, so when you’re going to cook dinner or really any of the meals, they have a nice 
little—I don’t even know what you call ‘em. Those like cams that they put in the baby’s room or whatever that 
you can point. So, I take my little planner camera and I stick it on him wherever he happens to be sitting, and I 
have to take the video part of it, so I can watch him when I am in the other room cooking or putting stuff 
together, and then even once you’ve made it you’ve gotta make sure that he’s actually gonna eat it, like, he’s 
got a relatively picky pallet, and I mean calories are important. They need to get their protein and all the good 
vitamins and stuff in order to stay strong and healthy. I mean, yeah, cooking is not that hard but being safe and 
providing the right, like, variety of food so that he’s getting nutrients he needs and stuff, and then actually 
getting him to eat the food. I mean there there’s more to it than just goin’ to the kitchen and puttin’ together a 
peanut butter and jelly or somethin’ [57.24]. 
I: 
You said he has a picky pallet, do you have a— 
P: 
He does. Oh, my, goodness. If I could just get that man to say, “This is good,” or like, “that was 
delicious one time, just one time—I hand him stuff, and he’ll—if he’s hungry—he’ll gobble up half of it, and then 
but once he’s like through the I’m starved part of his eating—I’m like, how is it? Does it taste all right? He’s like, 
“Mela.” [Laughing] I’m like just kind of in this little groany sound, like I’ve had better. One time, actually, I won’t 
lie. One time I got him to say that it was very good. My family just recently—my cousin was in from out of town, 
and we got together and made enchiladas, and I had asked him previous to this, like, what would be the dish 
that I could bring you that you would be like, “Yes! I’m happy with this meal.” And he said, “I love enchiladas.” 
And I’m like, all right, so when my family got together, and we made enchiladas there were leftovers, so I made 
him a plate, and brought it, and he actually—he gave me a very good. I said how is it? He says, “Very good.” 
And I felt like victorious about that very good, because normally I get this, like, half sneer [laughs’. 
I: 
Is it hard to get him to eat even if he likes food? 
P: 
No—if he likes it, he eats pretty good, but if its like, I don’t know, yeah. It’s a little bit like come on, finish 
this. You’ve got to at least Boost, you know, like that’s— 
I: 
So, you mentioned your family [55.43] made enchiladas, is your heritage Mexican as well? 
P: 
I’m half, yeah, Mexican/German. 
I: 
Okay. And do you feel like that cultural heritage influences your— 
P: 
It probably helps. It probably helps because he is very—mmm—involved in his culture, I think even 
more so than my family is, but that little bridge helps to be able to, you know—he’s got the tamale stories, and 
we’ve got the tamale stories, and it, yeah. And he asks about my grandma and stuff, and then I tell him Casteo. 
He’s like, “Oh, Casteo, yeah.” [Laughing] I’m like—I don’t know. It helps I think. 
I: 
We’re gonna take a small break. 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
He’s gonna swap out some batteries. I’m actually gonna leave this running, if it’s okay with you? 
P: 
Yeah. Yeah.

I2: 
I’ll be quick. 
I: 
So, we’ll move into some questions about the job conditions themselves, and what I’d like to do is just 
throw out some scenarios at you and see if you’ve experienced these, and if you have how you handled them. 
And I know that you have done a little bit of homecare work, but you’ve also done the nursing home work or 
long-term care, and so you’re at a position to be able to compare the two. 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
And draw on some experiences you’ve had from either one, so we’ll talk a little bit about the labor 
conditions, if that’s okay. 
P: 
All right. 
I: 
So, you see this as a—well, I’ll wait on that question, but. 
I2: 
One second. I’m almost done. 
I: 
All right. No worries. So, you have one semester left of nursing school. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And then you’re planning to get a job as a nurse here in this area? 
P: 
Yup. I hope to. Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Do you have a special—right now, you’re working with elders.  
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Is that a special population that you would like to work with? 
P: 
I do enjoy my work with the elderly. I don’t [53.21] honestly know. I don’t honestly know where I plan on 
landing. At one time I thought surgical sounded very interesting, but we’ll see. I don’t know. 
I: 
But you’re not driven to work with the elderly? It’s just— 
P: 
I do very much enjoy it. I think that— 
I2: 
I’m ready. 
I: 
Good. I’m sorry about that car noise. 
I2: 
Oh, no. It’s okay. I barely hear it in this. 
I: 
I mean every once in a while, we’ll get a big huge farm equipment [going by]. 
I2: 
Oh, that’s fine. The light in here is just worth everything. 
I: 
All right. So, we’re back on. 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
And I’m going to move into a little bit of a different line of questioning. I wanna hear about the job 
conditions. You were talking about what you do for people, and it sounds like it’s the technical skills, but also 
the people skills, and now I’d like to hear more about just what it’s like financially, for example. May I ask what 
you’re getting paid from C? 
I: 
$12.50. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Rachel Esch. 6.27.18 
 
6
I: 
$12.50. Okay. And, you’ve done other personal care work in the home, and what would you say is your 
average wage. 
P: 
Well, the last person that I cared for in the home, I was only here and there never even got paid. It was 
more of a volunteering kind of—‘cause it was nearly a family member, basically. Family adjacent [laughing]. 
I: 
Family adjacent. I’ve never heard that [laughing] expression. That’s a good one. So, $12.50, and 
approximately how many hours a week do you do that? 
P: 
I am, mmm, like, 3 days a week, pretty much. Three days a week. 
I: 
Three days a week. 
P: 
Yeah. Eight-hour days. 
I: 
Okay. 
P: 
So, 24 hours. 
I: 
Twenty-four hours. And I don’t know what your living situation is, if you’re on your own or? 
P: 
I’m living with my boyfriend. 
I: 
And is that wage, that number of hours—are you able to make ends meet? 
P: 
I mean if it was just me, no, but he has a pretty good job, so I’m lucky in that he takes care of me, I 
guess [laughs] a little bit [50.43]. 
I: 
And you’re not doing any work through an agency at all? 
P: 
Mmp mmm. 
I: 
It’s all— 
P: 
Yup. 
I: 
--contract, and you worked out the conditions with C?  
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Who’s the daughter? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
So, you worked out the pay rate, the number of hours, and I’m assuming no benefits? 
P: 
No. 
I: 
Okay. But it’s a set number of hours that you can count on, and it’s the same hours every week? 
P: 
Right. And I, honestly, if I wanted more hours she would give me more hours. It’s just a matter of I’m 
getting stuff done—we’re remodeling a bit at my home, and also studying for tests and things like that. 
I: 
So, you have other things going on. 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
So, what’s the most challenging thing about this line of work? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Rachel Esch. 6.27.18

P: 
You know, I honestly don’t find one-on-one caregiving to be that hard on me [49.4] because I’ve been 
fortunate in that I think I’ve worked with families that are also very present for the person that I’m caring for. I 
think that in certain situations it could be much more difficult because of, you know, they’re relying more, I 
guess, on the caregiver. But I’ve also had, like, kinda support with the people that I’m caring for. 
I: 
The family. 
P: 
Yeah. From the family. 
I: 
And that support is important? 
P; 
Oh, yes. 
I: 
In what way? 
P: 
The fact that they provide the things that are necessary for the person that you’re caring for. Like, 
you’ve got briefs and toothpaste and, you know, the necessities of daily living available for that person rather 
than having to scramble for anything or not having the thing that you need when you need it, and you’re trying 
to care for somebody and I don’t know, things could be worse, basically. I mean the houses that are prepared, 
I guess, is what I mean to say. 
I: 
So, the houses you’ve been in have been decent physically speaking? 
P: 
Right. And I’m sure even you could say they’re financially stable houses. Like, not everybody that has 
somebody that’s part of the elderly population has the money maybe to pay for all the stuff that they do need. 
It’s expensive. 
I: 
It’s expensive for— 
P: 
Yeah. Well, to—I mean—I guess I don’t really know what I mean [laughs]. There’s cost involved in 
keeping somebody healthy. I don’t know. I’ve been lucky that I’ve been in places where they’re willing to pay 
that cost, I guess [47.36]. 
I: 
So, earlier you were talking a little bit about the differences between nursing homes and home care, 
can you expand on that a little bit? 
P: 
I guess that’s where I’m—mmm—yeah, I was already kind of comparing in my mind I guess because 
where I’ve been in some of the long-term care facilities, it’s kind of unfortunate the state of affairs. Like, you’ll 
have 20 odd residents and 2 and 3 caregivers on to take care of all of those residents at the same time, and 
that’s, you know, 6 or 7 people to one caregiver, and you don’t really have the time to spend with people like 
you should. They just kinda get, I don’t know, a little bit neglected, I guess. Not, neglect like the kind you could 
charge somebody with, but, it’s like just they’re not being engaged as much as you would hope in the long-term 
care settings that I’ve been in. 
I: 
This might seem like an obviously silly question, but why is the one-on-one so much better? 
P: 
‘Cause you’ve got opportunity to, you know, develop that relationship with that person, and they 
become comfortable with you, and that really does make everything so much easier. And also, you’re not 
working with one of the other six people when one of them decides to get up and start walking somewhere, 
and then have the fall accident where they get injured and—I don’t know. There’s a lot more time to just, you 
know, spend and focus on the person that you’re caring for when it’s one-on-one ratio to one-on-six [45.23]. 
I: 
Well, you’ve mentioned safety.

P: 
Right. Safety and you’ve gotta, you know, there’s a lot of things to pay attention to. Like, you ‘ve gotta 
pay attention to their skin when you’re changing their clothes, and make sure that they’ve not got any wounds 
or anything that you’re overlooking or—you’ve got make, you know, get their teeth as clean as possible, and 
it’s just noticing little things, and having the opportunity to notice the little things with how much time you can 
spend with them. 
I: 
And the value of noticing the little things? 
P: 
Oh, you can prevent so much terrible big things if you can notice some of the little things early. It’s a 
preventative. 
I: 
Like what? 
P: 
Like if you notice the little red spot on their tailbone, it could turn into a pressure ulcer, and you know, 
those can go deep as your bone, and they’re terrible and take a long time to heal and [44.27] can lead to all 
sorts of other problems like you’ve got a bad enough pressure ulcer you could end up bed-bound, and then 
you’ve got pneumonia to worry about, and on and on it goes. And I think really anytime with the elderly 
population when you lose any kind of mobility you’re asking for things to cascade into a bad direction, and if 
you can notice the little thing you can stop it—the cascade before it even gets started because the little thing is 
easy to fix. It’s the big thing that turns into like this giant boulder that gets it’s speed goin’ and you can’t stop 
the big thing sometimes after it gets goin’. 
I: 
So, it sounds like you need some good observation skills? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
And at a nursing home, if you observe something, you tell the nurse? 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
What do you do when you’re in a home situation? 
P: 
Not everybody tells the nurse even. Well, in this situation I’ll definitely—C would be my first place to 
touch base if I notice anything strange with M. I would tell her immediately, but if it was anything that I thought 
was dire, I mean she’s got hospital information that she would prefer what hospital to contact and everything to 
send him out to if it’s something that’s like, right now, and she’s not at the house. I’m totally comfortable 
making a call to medical professional to come and see him versus letting something get worse while she’s 
away. But you know, for the most part, it’s not gonna be an emergent situation, and I can wait and talk to her 
about it, and if it’s something that she’s already aware of then, great. If it’s not, then, you know, she’s proactive 
enough that she’s—I trust her to get him the help that he would need. Basically, see a doctor or go to the 
hospital depending on the severity. 
I: 
So, what do you think about the fact that the work that you’re doing is often referred to as non-skilled or 
low skilled? 
P: 
I think that it can definitely be those things if you’ve got a caregiver that’s maybe not—I mean there’s 
different levels of caregiver. Not all caregivers are cut from the same cloth. Some of ‘em do just show up and 
stick somebody in a chair and bare minimum and call it good, and that’s really sad and unfortunate. But the 
ones that are doin’ a good job that are watching out for that, you know, little snowflake before it becomes an 
avalanche, that’s [snaps fingers]—and you know, those things matter. I mean, ultimately, it’s a life you’ve got 
resting on your shoulders when you’re taking care of someone, and you know, it’s important to be observant 
and aware and accept your responsibility I guess for that piece of things [40.54].

I: 
So, the example you used was a little red spot on the tailbone. I’m guessing that there are many, many 
moments during the day that could go either way. 
P: 
Oh, yeah.  
I: 
When you’re giving someone a shower or taking them to the bathroom and their unstable on their 
feet— 
P: 
Right. I mean if they’re an unsteady person, for sure, every time they get up is a potential for—and all it 
would take is, you know, M wears a gait belt, and I follow behind it him pretty much everywhere he goes. All it 
would take is being lazy, like, one time and not being behind him, and then what’s he do, except topple over? 
And you know, for an elderly person that’s probably possible—not probably—well, yeah, broken bones, and 
you know—and then there’s your mobility [39.55]. 
I: 
So, you mentioned a few minutes ago, I think your words were, you basically have somebody’s life on 
your hands. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Can you expand on that a little bit? 
P: 
Well, I mean if you do decide to stick with somebody that’s unsteady—if you do decide to go and do 
something else while somebody that is unsteady is up and walking around and they do fall, I mean that’s—I 
keep on coming back to this fall situation because that’s my worry for M most of the time. But if he was to, you 
know, fall and he breaks his hip and then you’ve gotta deal with being bed-bound for however long it takes to 
heal his—well, they usually get you up, actually, pretty quick after a hip, but that example may be for a bump 
[laughing], but you know, and then an elderly person with pneumonia. Pneumonia kills a lot of elderly people. 
That is literally a straight-line to you weren’t walking with them, they broke something, they gotta be stuck in 
bed for a while, now, they end up with pneumonia, and the pneumonia has a pretty high fatality rate in elderly 
populous. It’s not a good thing to get. Or just, you know, a bed sore that turns into an infection that turns into 
sepsis, like, anything small has the potential to turn into something big and awful. And you’ve gotta stop that 
small thing if you’re being a good caregiver. 
I: 
That’s the person on the ground that’s present that can— 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
--make that difference. 
P: 
Right. You’re the one, either being behind every time or not. I mean that’s— 
I: 
So, back to this description of that this is an unskilled/low-skilled/non-skilled job [37.56], if you’re talking 
about, and you said, well, if the person doesn’t have any skills and they just go in and they sit there, fine— 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
But let’s talk about a good direct care worker [laughs], you know, an ideal care worker, what kinda 
skills—what skills are there? 
P: 
I mean a lot of it to me does have—with the social aspect. You’ve gotta be somebody that’s personable 
and learning to come into work, and actually, engage rather than come in and bein’ a grump, ‘cause that sets a 
tone. But also, you know, there’s just the regular caregiving skills, like if you’re wanting to—like, just changing a 
person. Like, with M he’s had a stoke and he’s got some slight mobility issues with one of his arms, and just 
bein’ aware that that’s the side that you dress first, or that’s the side that you, you know, just how—getting 
them dressed, and makin’ sure which side he approaches the chair from, so that he’s not getting his one foot 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Rachel Esch. 6.27.18

stuck and tripping on himself type thing or like even, like, cleaning dentures [36.31] or that kinda thing. Like, so 
you don’t break somebody’s dentures. There’s, I don’t know. A lotta things that seem simple, there’s little 
pieces to remember, and if you don’t remember those little pieces, then you’re not necessarily doing what you 
ought to be doing, I guess, for the person that you’re caring for. 
I: 
And how did you learn to do all of those things? 
P: 
School [laughs], and sometimes just my own watchin’ videos and stuff online, educating myself on my 
own time, but mostly school—LCC. 
I: 
Okay. Because I noticed that you have—I mean you talked about the gait belt, for example. Most 
people don’t even know what a gait belt is. 
P: 
Oh, yeah. It’s—you don’t need explaining—other’s—oh, you do wanna know? 
I: 
Mmm hmm. 
P: 
It’s just a belt that you’re basically meant to put around their ribcage, so that when they’re up and 
walking around you can put your hand underneath the belt, like, on their back, and then if they were to start to 
teeter on you, you’d kinda pull ‘em back and have ‘em set on your knee so that rather than them falling to the 
ground they’re leaning on you for a second, and if you can get them to regain their balance, then great. If not, 
then you’ve got a guided to the ground rather than a falling to the ground, which is obviously gonna be a lot 
safer. [Laughs] I was about to make up a word—and not cause injury. Their you go. That’s the way to say it 
[34.48] [laughs]. 
I: 
So, there’s some skill in even knowing how to use that gait belt? 
P: 
Right. Yeah, which is funny ‘cause C didn’t know that that was the point of that. That you were 
supposed to pull them back onto you. She was like, “Oh. I woulda just—I don’t know what [laughs].” So, I 
spread that little piece of knowledge to her. 
I: 
Which raises another point. Some people feel like the paid non-family caregivers should get training, 
but not necessarily the family caregivers. 
P: 
She’s actually taking a class right now. 
I: 
Is she? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. So, I mean, yeah. I would think some form of training would be good for the non-paid 
family caregiver just so that they can, you know, prevent injury on their watch. But, yeah, you’re right, probably 
that doesn’t always happen. 
I: 
So, you’re not just—you’ve been talking about the whole context. 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
So, it’s not just—you’re not just taking care of a client, you’re taking— 
P: 
Oh, yeah. You gotta be open communication with the family for sure ‘cause they obviously need to 
know like if he suddenly sounded more confused or a little off his balance or more tired or he didn’t eat very 
much or any of that stuff that’s important for you to communicate with them as being the rest of his caregiving 
team, I mean. 
I: 
So, the caregiving team—it seems like you’re also providing support services for the whole family and 
for C, not just for M.

P: 
To some degree, yeah [33.02].  
I: 
In terms of like respite. 
P: 
Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah. I know what you’re saying. For sure. Yeah. It’s definitely—I mean what do they 
call that—caregiver role strain—that’s a thing. And having him living at home with her and being around, you 
know, 24-7, it’s definitely, you know, good for her to be able to have some time where she doesn’t have to be 
his caregiver. Like, she might not always leave when I’m there, but she’s being able to get some of the stuff 
that she needs to get done, and that’s, you know, I understand that. It’s important to be able to have some time 
to get her own life’s cares out of the way I guess, spend some time with her grandkids in a one-on-one kinda 
way rather than havin’ to worry about what dad’s doin’ every, you know. Make sure dad’s not fallin’ and all that 
stuff. 
I: 
So, you mentioned—I asked you about the most challenging things. What are the most rewarding 
things? 
P: 
Havin’ them smilin’ and laughin’ at you, and [sigh]—I don’t know. I feel like a lotta the times people 
undervalue the elderly community, and I just find they’ve had so many experiences, and most of the time 
they’re so darn funny. Like— 
I: 
Can you tell a story that made you laugh? 
P: 
[Laughs] yeah. Mi made me laugh or M. Mi, sorry, that’s his grandson. M made me laugh the other day. 
His physical therapist was comin’ over, and he was like not really feelin’ like he wanted to exercise with the 
physical therapist. He’s like, “Let me go just take a nap.” I’m like he’s gonna be here in like 10 minutes. You 
can take a nap, you know, after you’re done exercisin’. I’m like you wasted away your morning nap by this time 
you’ve gotta stay up because they’re gonna be here anytime. He’s like mmm. He’s like, “What if we just tell ‘em 
I’m sick?” I’m like, I am not about to start makin’ stories up for you to your physical therapist, so you don’t have 
to exercise [30.26]. We’ve gotta keep you—all these muscles that you got. He’s like, “Oh.” He’s like, “I see 
who’s side you’re now. I got your number. Tellin’ me you won’t make up stories.” And just that—I don’t know. I 
found that quite amusing that he was like, “See who’s side you’re on.”  
I: 
So, just that little exchange? 
P: 
Yeah. He’s funny. Or like he’ll start singin’ a sad Spanish song, and he gets this like—and he looks like 
crocodile tears. Like he mocks like he’s having a real emotional breakdown. One time he started doin’ it while 
we were up and walkin’ around, and I’m like, [laughing] are you okay? And he’s like “Boo hoo.” And he’s just 
faking crying with these big ole—just looked like I stubbed his toe into somethin’ and I was all concerned, and 
then he just started laughing at me like, “Ah, ha, ha. I got you.” Like what? But, now, I know, and I’ll watch out 
for that. 
I: 
You’re on to him [laughs]. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
So, that’s what you value are those moments? 
P: 
Yes. The moments—and like—I don’t know. I think that if you do get that friendship/caregiver thing 
going on, like, his granddaughter was jealous not too long ago because I got him to play me some guitar. He 
spent the afternoon just plinking away and playin’, singing, and they came back from the movies or something, 
I think they were, and I showed ‘em a picture. I’m like look at this, and she’s like, “Oh.” She’s like, “I asked him 
to play for me not a week ago, and what did he tell me?” “Ah, meha, no.” [Laughs] but you know, I don’t know. 
I: 
So that felt like a victory for you? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Rachel Esch. 6.27.18 
 
12
P: 
Yeah. Well, I don’t know, I like spendin’ time—that’s good times. I like havin’ them laughin’ and—I don’t 
know. I enjoy engaging. 
I: 
It sounds like you got—it’s a two-way. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
You’re there to provide supportive services and help, but— 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
--you’re getting a lot in return as well. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. It feels good to help somebody else [28.13].  
I: 
Okay. We’re gonna pause. 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
So, we’re gonna move, now, into a set of questions about—this is the last section—about the social, 
political, economic context in which this direct care work is situated, so think about what you might want to tell 
a legislator about the work you do, and how this work could be supported. What’s the value in it, and how’s it 
supported? So, just think about that for a second. 
I2: 
It’s ready. 
P: 
I guess I don’t really know.  
I: 
Pretend he’s the President—well, maybe not the president. [Laughs] pretend he’s Governor Snyder or 
something. 
P: 
I don’t really know what the governors are capable of? 
I: 
Or any decisionmaker, anybody that has some power over wages or training. All right. We’re back on. 
And we’re going to move into just a few more questions about this shortage, I mentioned earlier, and how are 
we going to get 32,000 more PCAs? How are we going to inspire people to go into this field, and how do we 
educate policymakers about the value of the work that you do, and why it’s important to support wages? You 
mentioned training a couple of times. So, first of all what would you say to let’s say a group of young people 
about—who are trying to figure out what to do. 
P: 
For instance, you’re talking about inspiring a group of young people [25.18] as far as caregiving? 
I: 
Yeah. You’re gonna talk to ‘em. Let’s say it’s a job fair. It’s at the high school. They’ve got a table set 
up, you know, different kinds of career choices, and you’re there to talk about direct care work? You wanna tell 
‘em what it is you do? You know, some of the hard things that they should be prepared for, but what are the 
rewards, and why might they consider going into this line of work? 
P: 
It’s kind of a hard sell isn’t it? ‘Cause there’s not much glamour [laughing] in it, and there’s definitely, 
you know, you’re in a chance to encounter some bodily fluids and [laughs] yucky things. [Sighs] I don’t know. I 
guess to me the—these are people that, you know, have done their time and contributed their piece to makin’ 
our society what it is, and they’ve, you know, they deserve to be taken care of in the best way that we can 
provide for them. And it seems like people will say that it’s easy work, but you’ve definitely gotta come in and 
have that positive mindset because, especially if you’re working with somebody that’s Alzheimer’s, and you’re 
gonna have to repeat yourself and be okay with repeating yourself and not get frustrated because it’s not, you 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Rachel Esch. 6.27.18 
 
13
know, it’s not something that they’re aware that they’re doin’ or doing to be irritating. It’s just a symptom of their 
condition. It’s very rewarding, in my opinion. I, ooh, I don’t know. I’m talkin’ in circle, now. 
I2: 
Let me ask a question. 
P: 
Yes. 
I2: 
You’ve chosen a career direction.  
P: 
Yes. 
I2: 
Can you talk a little bit about how PCA work is helping your ultimate career destination, and how that 
could be—would you or would you not recommend this? 
P: 
Oh, yeah. I would recommend it. I think—I mean there’s obviously a very large elderly population that 
nurses deal with. A lot of the places that you can go after you become a nurse deals directly with elderly 
people [22.31] and in hospitals and stuff, obviously, older people get sick just as often as young people if not 
more. And being comfortable working with the elderly populace is gonna do nothing but make you a stronger 
nurse or really anything in the healthcare field I think you should, you know, work towards that level of comfort. 
I don’t know. 
I: 
Some people are afraid to work with older adults, you know, the elders. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Everybody wants to work with kids, be in sports medicine or this or that, but— 
P: 
Yeah. It’s maybe flashier. 
I: 
But the advantages of working with the elders are? 
P: 
They’re, you know, they’ve had their whole lives, and they’ve got such a rich—in my experience they’ve 
got so many rich experiences that they’re—my experience, experience—they’ve got so much that if you sit and 
engage with them that they’re willing to share with you, and I think that it’s kind of like a font of knowledge that 
sometimes nobody bother’s tappin’ into, and that’s unfortunate. And, you know, even these people that have 
the Alzheimer’s and the dementia, they still have things to offer lots of times. I mean they’ve got their own, you 
know experiences and stories, and I don’t know. I think that hearing some of those can do—can’t do anything 
but make your life richer for having been a part of theirs. 
I: 
So, let’s talk about the public. I mean that was—we’re talking about trying to get people to join—to 
make this a career. The general public, what would you like to say to them about the value of the work that you 
do? 
P: 
[Sigh] 
I: 
Why is it important to you? 
P: 
I mean [sigh] I think it’s important just because these—like I said before, these people have lived their 
lives, and they’ve paid their dues, and they’ve—they deserve—they deserve to be cared for and not just be like 
ignored or shoved off onto the side of society like they don’t matter anymore after a certain age. Like, people—
there’s definitely—ageism is a true thing, and I think it’s—I don’t know— 
I: 
Can you expand on that a little bit? Why do you think ageism is a true thing? 
P: 
Oh, well, I mean come on. [Laughing] you can almost see it in everything. People are quick to dismiss 
the opinions of [18.50]—well, maybe not—okay. That’s a generalization. Not everyone, but lots of people are 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Rachel Esch. 6.27.18 
 
14
quick to dismiss opinions that just don’t conform with there’s a guess maybe, and oftentimes when you’re 
coming from different age groups you’re coming from a different set of circumstances that you’re brought up in, 
and so your beliefs tend to be varied and—I don’t know. Now, I’m rambling off on this side topic, but people 
tend to treat older people like they are almost [inaudible – 18.12] sometimes. Like—and I sorta understand 
because sometimes that’s when they’re extremely Alzheimer’s patients that sometimes they don’ have the 
words even. But they still shouldn’t be talked down to. I don’t know. 
I: 
So, what I’m hearing you say is that you think we need to show more respect? 
P: 
Right. Yeah. I think they’ve earned it. 
I: 
And they’ve earned it, and they have these long rich lives that we can learn from. All of that aside 
though, what would happen to these people if there were no PCAs? 
P: 
Oh, God. I don’t know. They’d probably get sick and die earlier than they [laughing] need to. I mean 
that’s a pretty direct answer, I guess, but—or you just have family that never gets to go and do anything I 
guess, watchin’ them. I don’t know. But that seems like even a sort of positive scenario if you’re sayin’ there’s 
no PCAs. 
I: 
What would happen to C if she didn’t have help? 
P: 
She would be real stressed out all the time, and she wouldn’t be able to enjoy her life as much because 
like she does, you know, choir and stuff that she needs somebody there to take care of dad so that she can got 
practice, and so… 
I: 
And what would happen to someone like M if he didn’t have family? I mean there are a number of—
quite a lot of elders who have no family? 
P: 
Oh, my goodness. Yes. That’s true. I honestly don’t know. Probably some state-run something. 
I: 
Would they be able to stay at home? 
P: 
Would he be able to stay at home on his own? No. No. He’s not—he can’t do his own meals, and he 
relies pretty heavily on somebody. Whoever happens to be providing his care at the time I guess, but he needs 
somebody around. And even just—he needs somebody to be able to kinda talk to, I guess, ‘cause if you leave 
it to his discretion every time he sees his bed, he’d be takin’ a nap. I mean, and you know, obviously that’s not 
a good place to be. If you’re in bed all the time, you’re just gonna deteriorate [15.34]. 
I: 
So, if somebody with no family or even people like C had no PCA, these people might go to a state-run 
institution. They might go to a nursing home. They might just get sick earlier and die, so it seems like the PCA 
worker is kind of important. 
P: 
Oh, yeah. Yeah. [Laughs] they might just get sick earlier and die, I mean that [laughs] in itself I think, 
yeah. The PCA’s providing relief for the family, and allowing these people to stay in their homes, and I mean 
that—that is really important to a lot of elderly folks out there is they would like as much as possible to be able 
to maintain that homelife, and they don’t wanna be stuck in a nursing home let alone some institution beyond 
that. 
I: 
Yeah. I think that’s important to not just the elders, but all of us. 
P: 
Right. Yeah. 
I: 
So, let’s talk about—we just talked about general public—let’s talk about the decision makers who have 
some power to, you know, trying to fix this situation. The PCAs are important. It allows people to stay at home. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Rachel Esch. 6.27.18 
 
15
It’s better care, quality of life, all of that, but we have this situation where we don’t have enough of them, and as 
you said, it’s a hard sell [laughs]. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
--to get people into this line of work. What recommendations would you have for policymakers in terms 
of how do we make this a more appealing career choice, and support this workforce? 
P: 
Um, well, some kinda benefits [13.30] available for PCAs would be nice. 
I: 
Benefits? 
P: 
Benefits. Yeah. Like, healthcare for [laughing] one. You know, that’s important. Also, yeah, some kind 
of a wage—I mean I’m not complaining about my situation. I feel like with M that’s relatively fair. He’s not a 
terrible hassle and like from—okay. So, for example at the long-term care place—I know this doesn’t exactly 
apply, but it’s still pretty close, they were $9.50 an hour, and that was with, you know, 20 odd people to care 
for, and that’s pretty hard to wanna work and do a good job caring for somebody when you can go down the 
street and see Taco Bell’s hiring people for like $13 an hour at the drive through. Like we care more about 
frickin’ Gordita’s than we do our grandpas and grandmas of the world [claps]. Like, that doesn’t seem 
[laughing] right. I don’t know. And yeah, you know, if the family caregivers had some sort of educational 
program in place that they could, you know, sign up for just some kinda class so they could know more about 
what it’s gonna mean to take care of their elderly loved one, and keepin’ them in the best health that you can 
and all that. I mean there’s a need for education, and yeah, the wages. Wages is sort of an important part of it. 
I: 
Wages? 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Benefits? 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Education for family caregivers? Training for the direct care workers? 
P: 
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Really, education for anybody that’s gonna be involved in the care of, you know, 
somebody that needs it. There’s a lotta ways that you can accidentally hurt somebody [11.11], and that would 
be just a terrible—I can’t even imagine. That’d be a terrible feeling to accidently hurt somebody that you care 
about or even just for. 
I: 
Does that worry you at all that you might--? 
P: 
I stick pretty dang close to [laughing] my people when I’m carin’ for ‘em. That’s exactly. It’s in the back 
of my mind for sure as something that I wanna prevent, but yeah. 
I: 
Do you ever worry about injuring yourself? 
P: 
I have in the past. Not so much with M ‘cause he’s not a very big guy, and I’m not a very small girl, but 
I’ve cared for, like, in the long-term care facility there was a man that was—God, what was he, like, 6’ 5” and 
like 300 and some pounds probably, and I mean, you can throw two people even my size, which normally my 
partner or buddy was not my size. They’re a smaller person, and if he decided to try and fall on us, you know, 
we’re gonna try to slow it down, but, shoot, there’s not really much you can do. So, yeah, there’s times when 
you worry about gettin’ injured but— 
I: 
Did you get injured?

P: 
Um, eeehoo, not really. Not really. I had one lady once try to throw a coat rack at me, but [laughs] she 
sorta missed [laughing]. 
I: 
I was gonna ask you about that earlier how you did with combative behavior? 
P: 
Yeah. You just gotta be the calm one. 
I: 
Yeah. You gotta be the calm one [laughs]. Somebody’s gotta stay calm. 
P: 
Yup. And definitely some people react partly to that when they get aggressive towards—somebody gets 
aggressive toward them, they get that aggressive, like it’s like reflex. You can’t do that. That’s not a good way 
[9.13]. 
I: 
So, I’m thinking when you’re trying to appeal to young people, you can sorta flip it all. You could say, 
Yeah, you gotta deal with aggressive people who might be combative or you’ve gotta say the same thing 20 
times over, but you know, you could make that sound bad, like, are you kidding? I gotta do that, and bodily 
fluids too? 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Or you could flip it and say, it takes an extraordinary person to deal with those things. Somebody has to 
stay calm, you know. Somebody has to think on their feet. You’re responsible for somebody’s life. 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
You know, you could turn it and make it a more positive appeal.  
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Like, it takes a really extraordinary person to do this kinda work. You have to have some real special 
skills. 
P: 
See. Look at that. You’re great at the spin. 
I: 
And not everybody has—[inaudible] should be filming this part, well, I am. 
P: 
[Laughs]. 
I: 
But I say that in part because one thing we have found is that the direct care worker—the personal care 
aides down play what they do. It’s like, “Yeah. I just take ‘em to the bathroom. You know, somebody’s gotta 
stay calm,” and you kind of down play all of that when really not everybody could do that. 
P: 
Oh, yeah. And not everybody that does, does it great either. I mean I wish that they were all great, but 
I’ve had to, you know, not and—and see I keep coming back ‘cause I’ve had really good experiences with my 
direct care people. It was more the long-term care facilities that kinda make you go, ooohh. I had to call co-
workers out before for the way that they’ve decided to treat somebody in my presence. I see them being awful, 
I’m not gonna just set and let them be awful and not say anything, type thing [7.10]. 
I: 
That has to be hard. 
P: 
It is hard. It’s hard to have to even say it. Like, the fact that it has to be said is [sigh], like, I don’t know. 
It’s like your stress shouldn’t erase your acknowledgement of their humanity. These are people, and just 
because they can’t do for themselves like they used to, doesn’t mean you should treat ‘em any less. 
I: 
That was such a great quote. 
P: 
Oh, thanks [laughs].

I: 
Your stress should not—whatever it was that you said. 
P: 
[Laughing]. 
I: 
Thankfully we have it on tape. Yeah, and then you have to keep working with that person— 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
--after you’ve called them out. That’s kind of like awkward [6.21]. 
P: 
Yes. It has been, but it’s not been a thing I’ve had to do more than one with anybody. I think maybe just 
because they don’t do it around me doesn’t necessarily mean that I believe that they stopped being kind of a 
jerk, but at least they didn’t do it around me, I guess. And I often brought it to the attention of my supervisors 
anyway, so that, you know, it wasn’t something that just kinda got under the rug. It was official—like, this 
happened. Yeah. 
I: 
Good for you. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
So, we only have a few minutes left. Do you have any final words for Governor Snyder over here or you 
know, what do you want to tell the world? Any final thoughts you want to tell the world about the work that you 
do? 
P: 
I don’t know. Caregiving—I think anytime that you’re taking care of somebody, be it an adult or a child 
or just anybody that it’s kind of in turn something that’s good for your part. I don’t know. I don’t how to say that 
any better. It feels like personal growth when they do something that’s—like, when they go from walking 8 
minutes to walkin’ 10 minutes. It feels like you did something. And I mean they did it, but you helped them get 
there, and that’s—that’s a good feeling to be able to help somebody. And, yeah, definitely, definitely 
educational programs in place and the, you know, benefits and providing some support for the families that are 
trying to get caregivers, and I don’t really know how all that would go about happening, but that would be great 
if it did. 
I: 
And we started out by saying we’re trying to put a human face to the caregivers, and so want to 
acknowledge that there is more to you than just being a PCA? 
P: 
Oh, yeah, sure. 
I: 
You’re a whole person. So, if you don’t mind, would you feel comfortable just sharing a little bit about 
who you are as a person, you know, what do you do when you’re not doing PCA work? 
P: 
What do I do when I’m not a PCA? My family’s very close knit, so I spend a lot of time with my family. I 
have three God Children, and they’re a heck of a good time—9, 7, and 6. I’m an artist. 
I: 
An artist. What kind of artist? 
P: 
Whichever kind you want me to be. I can pretty much make all sorts of things. I sculpt. I carve. I’ve 
done several murals that I’ve gotten paid hundreds of dollars for. I have a German Shepard. She takes a lotta 
time. They require attention [laughs]. I don’t know. I do lots of stuff [laughing]. 
I: 
So, what’s your favorite pastime? 
P: 
Mmm, I’m a reader. I do love me some fantasy and sci-fi. If you’ve never heard of him, Patrick Rothfust 
is a fabulous author. 
I: 
Never have.

P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And if somebody said, just describe yourself to me, how would you describe yourself? 
P: 
I don’t know [laughs]. I feel like whenever people ask that, like, if I say anything good I’m feelin’ braggy, 
but I’m pretty cool [laughs]. 
I: 
Say somethin’ good.  
P: 
I [sigh], well, okay. So, when I was 12 my dad told me that I collect needy people, and I don’t know if 
that is the nicest [laughing] thing, but I’m definitely the person that my friends and family come to when they 
want an honest opinion.  I wouldn’t say that I—I don’t know. I’m sort of a life-coach to some [laughing], and I’m 
fine with that. Enjoy it. I’m an only child, so my parents are pretty important. I see them relatively frequently. I 
don’t know. I’m a giver. There you go. That’s a good word [1.16]. 
I: 
That is a good word. K, do you have anything to add? Okay. I’m gonna bring this to a close— 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
--by saying what I started out with, which is thank you. Thank you so much for— 
P: 
You’re welcome. 
I: 
--this interview and thank you for the work that you do because it’s really, really valuable. I’m glad 
you’re a good PCA, and I’m glad you’re— 
P: 
Oh, thanks. 
I: 
--doing it, so thanks. And now, we’re gonna stop and turn it over to K who’s going to take some 
wonderful pictures. 
P: 
Oh, pictures. 
I: 
Pictures! And just so you know, did I tell you what we’re doin’ with these pictures? 
P: 
Mmm? 
I: 
Did I tell you the refugee story? 
P: 
Nope. 
I: 
Oh, that’s his story. 
I2: 
Well, yeah. Let’s walk and talk [laughing]. 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
Because we got the idea for this project because of an earlier project he did similar to this with refugees 
in the Lansing area.
