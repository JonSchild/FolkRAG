Dear Dr. Botkin:
I wish to thank you belatedly for the very interesting copy of “75 Years of Progress.” I have
enjoyed reading it very much and I assure you I treasure it very highly.
I am sending you the records which I have made this summer. I hope you will find them
interesting. I am sorry that I did not have the equipment which would have aided me in
getting a larger amount of material. Dr.Bond and I made efforts to get the Fisk University
recording machine but it was reported, out of order, by Dr.Bond.
You will note that I have sent all of the discs which I telegraphed for. Since I was not able
to get the Fisk machine I could not use them. I noted too that you asked about some
records that were left here by Lewis Jones. I found none of these records when I returned
here in June. These records were never in my charge. You might write to Dr.Bond about
them. However, may I say we have purchased records and used several of same in
making recordings for you this summer. I am returning also the two needles which you
sent to me directly.
I expect to leave tomorrow for Atlanta. Please address me at 39 Chestnut Street, S.W.,
Atlanta, Georgia.

It occurs to me that it would be a good thing to have some music transcribed from some
of the recording material so that it could be used for singers, choirs, etc. Also may I say I
have some very remarkable songs from the water fronts of the country which I gathered
twenty years ago. These are all in manuscript. Anyway I should like to know your reaction
to such a proposal. I would like to be entrusted with such a project. Finally, I say again I
hope you will like the records. I did the best I could with practically no equipment. The part
of the Festival which you will find was made by the broadcasting company which was kind
enough to record for us the part of the Festival which was broadcast; otherwise, I would
not have been able to provide you with anything from the Festival.
Very sincerely yours, W. L. James Willis Laurence James Visiting Professor of Music
