Her Sweet Sailor Boy Far away on a bleak New England shore, The storm king rules, and the
tempests roar. A maiden waited all forlorn A-watching sails from night till morn. * Those weary days
she'd pass no more. Then pushing off her boat from shore, Her sail she set as down the bay She
spoke some vessel every day. * As she was passing down the main, She met three vessels coming
from Spain. She hailed the captain as he passed by, And then inquired for her sweet sailor boy. "Oh'
captain, captain, tell me true, Does my love William sail with you?" "Oh, no, fair lady, he's not here;
He's drownded in the sea, my dear." It grieved the captain's heart to tell, "Love William in the ocean
fell ** Near rocky isle as we passed by, There we lost your sweet sailor boy." She wrung her hands,
she tore her hair, Just like a lady in despair. She rowed her boat against a rock, And then we knew
her heart was broke. "Go dig my grave both wide and deep; Place a marble stone at my head and
feet, And on my breast place a turtle dove To let the world know I died for love." She wrung her
hands, she tore her hair, Just like a lady in despair. She rowed her boat against a rock, And then we
knew her heart was broke.

Page 2 HER SWEET SAILOR BOY. She wrung her hands, she tore her hair , Just like a lady in despair.
She rowed her boat against a rock , And then we knew her heart was broke. " Go dig my grave both
wide and deep ; Place a marble stone at my head and feet , And on my breast place a turtle dove To
let the world know I died for love. "

She wrung her hands, she tore her hair , Just like a lady in despair. She rowed her boat against a
rock , And then we knew her heart was broke.
This is a old song that was sung by the settlers of Sutters Fort in the early days of Californy and sung
by George Graham of San Jose.
I learned this song from my mother when I was about seven years old [md] in Iowa.
