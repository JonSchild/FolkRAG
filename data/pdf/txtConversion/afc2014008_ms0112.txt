enquiring first at the Folklore Department at the University
 
of Pennsylvania where Henry Glassie  (our Folk Arts panelist:),
 
gave her the name of Patricia Averill,  a folklorist at Douglas
 
College.
 The two met,  engaged in a brisk debate as to the
 
nature of  "quality"  in folk arts,  arrived at a mutually satis-
factory understanding,  and worked thenceforth as a team
 
Linda acting as mediator with the educational community and
 
Pat with the traditional comm unity.
 Both now say they could
 
not have done the job without the support of the other.
 
They selected the south New Jersey area as their point of
 
concentration;  after a quick survey by Pat,  two groups worn
 
agreed upon as representative:  the Ukranian ethnic population,
 
and the people from the Pine Barrens and the adjacent bay area
 
where traditional lore centers largely upon occupations.
 T
\ftnr
 
Pat discovered that most of the folks could not spare time
 
from their  jobs for prolonged appearances,  a complex pattern
 
of short-term residencies was developed within the many schools
 
of the district.
 Twenty-five folk artists are included,  appearing
 
during a six-week period in a variety of contexts:  classroom
 
visitation for lectures,  demonstration or actual instruction In
 
craft techniques;  assembly programs;  and field trips.
 
I visited two schools and watched four traditional artists at
 
work:  a Ukranian egg painter,  a Pine Barrens story t
 n
il or aol
 
singer,
 Pier Parrons farmer,  and T
i hay area clam di gger.

 Pat
 
persuad e

one participant pointed out that his tribe had not don. the
 
Squa s

around who ka., it.  He suggested that all, tribes should con
-
sider what, if any, of their abandoned cuatcms they wished
 
to revive as part of any overall cultural program. (2) Th*
 
vital point was made that, although we typically work up
 
projects in t.
 of trib e
s, the real ection in traditional
 
arts actau l
ly occurs first on the family level and then on
 
the coi aanity level.  All project., thus, should be carEfully
 
scrutinized to make sure that they do not do violence to
 
these crucial underlying b6bactures.  T*ts is a hard one and
 
wi l
l take m
iseb thinking about.  (3) Finally
 •  throughout the
 
confer e
nce, it was made perfectly, (and occaatcna f
ly pain-
fully) clear that Indians want to be in contral of their v n
 
ture and cultural apparatus.

by cct

were really saying was that they need technical assistance
 
rather than progr. a
matic diatatton  and the fact that they
 
could came out and may that in public struCk me as a very
 
favorable sign.  (Another inv a
lu bl. tip from Sarre Tosl k
sn
 
had been that Indiana just don't a ay at a meeting if they
 
don't like it; they s
lip out quietly for a drink of water
 
or so m
ething and simply never return.  And these folks stayed.)
 
Three days afterward, I got confirmation for my optiaiani.

I referred the issues embodied in this grant (
 
bad to the Yolk Arts Panel, and they continued to be
 
strongly supportive of it.  Their discussion was recorded
 
and can be transcribed, if you feel it im
portant.
 
The following paints embody my somewhat dawn-h o
ne analysis.
 
* 'l(pUl*tif
lg the yo-'yo. as Kr. Co u
c.pciom does, is as much
 
of an art as is juggling, high-wire walking or b Mmn-twirling,
 
or -
 to extend it & bit -
 kind of acrobatics or tumbling.
 
It is a skill, a feat, performed to v
am me and astonish and
 
anaze audience..
 It is not a g e
ne (
in the sense of a contest).
 
It is street* or popular, theatre.
 
Baton twirling and juggling plate& and yo-yoing do not now
 
to ae to be bich art, but they all clearly demand discipline,
 
traditional1 W expr..sivity (
though limited in nature), improvi-
sation, and skill.  It would be very difficult for ae to
 
distinguish Kr. Concepcion' * perfor

and for t

Pers o
nally, I would Not pay out a nickel to hear the seashells
 
slash (
though maybe the Music Progr e
e would), nor would I
 
venture fax to watch Mr. Concepcion' s performance.  B

 the child c

which the Phi Ujpiene-
