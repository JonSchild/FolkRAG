TX02: Visit to Leo & Hazel Landy G-Nesco; 12GT. 
Elaine Thatcher and I arrived at Leo Landy, Sr., house circa 
3 p.m. after some misdirection. 
Twice stopped to ask directions 
to the house. 
Both people knew Landy; one neighbor first 
clarified by enquiring, "the old man with the stuff (i.e., 
flowers)," as distinct from his son. 
Leo at first slightly put 
off, having expected us the day before, but admitted fault for 
having gotten the date mixed up. 
A wry old guy with a gray 
stubble of beard, slender, wiry. 
He was working on grape vine 
baskets of various sizes for florist customers. 
Base of basket a 
wreath of vines about 1 cm thick, donut shaped, with an arched 
handle of vine about 1.5x the diameter of the base. 
Sizes ranged 
from about 5-12 inches across. 
Behind house was a shed where 
most of his work was done heated by a barrel wood stove fired 
with scrap fiberboard obtained free from a local mill. 
Power 
tools included a table saw and a new power staple gun. 
Large 
shallow cardboard boxes cum trays lines one side of the shed, 
each containing measured bundles of a particular plant. 
On 
opposite wall were examples of each plant labeled and prepared by 
son. 
Also in yard were a smoke house for drying pitch pine 
cones, again fired by wood scraps, which was maybe 150 degrees 
inside. Hazel commented that the heat had broken their 
thermometer. 
Also a greenhouse about 30 ft long, an arch about 7 
feet high covered with plastic. 
Heat of sun here made it about 
120 dearees inside. 
Inside were several types of plants hung up 
to cure plus more pine cones, this latter application apparently 
a recent innovation. 
Elaine and I first conversed briefly with their daughter-in-
law, who proclaimed her sentimental attachment to the area. 
Several teenage grandchildren and their friends were on hand, 
tending a pet baby ferret and engaged in constructing a cage for 
it. 
Hazel came out of the house, equally well preserved and 
neater than her husband, and Elaine went to speak with her. 
No 
taping yet. 
I began questioning Leo by asking about seasonality 
of harvesting. 
He said timing was essential as plants matured 
quickly from green to red to rotten. 
In early October only a few 
"weeds" 
left, these are baby oats and sea grass. 
Baby oats are 
found in ditches with plenty of water, hard to harvest without 
boat. 
Sea grass grows in tidal areas in the water. 
Again should 
use boat. 
Pepper grass examples were being prepared nearby; 
however are "now shot," had to be harvested in June and July. 
All 
plants must be cut, then cleaned, then the moisture taken 
out. 
Sea lavender harvested in 
late September, must get when in 
Hunn--83 Fieldnotes 
page 2 
bloom; a week later it 
is shot. 
Grape vines harvested all 
winter; he makes 100 baskets of them and they're sold 
immediately. 
I asked when he started the business. 
He said he cut his 
1st cattail 
in 1939, 
learned the business from a Mr. Bassett (see 
below). 
He was born 
in Philly, worked there during World War II, 
moved out because it's now "nigger haven." 
"You can make a 
living (in the dried flower business)." 
Pepper grass sells for 
40-50 cents/lb. 
Used to sell pine seed; 
important not to mix 
"echinata" with "rigida." 
They got out of the pine seed business 
after New York customer refused to pay them for all they sent, 
claiming that not all the seeds they sent had germinated. 
Landy's skeptical; subsequently use only for feeding birds in 
yard. 
Used to sell okra pods also, but went out of that 
business; very hard to cure okra, 
it's too moist. 
I enquired of 
lotus pods Leo had 
in a box 
in his shed. 
He named them as "lotus 
pods," have big white flower, 
like penny (i.e., peony). 
He has 
permission of owner of a pond where it grows,probably planted by 
the pond owner. 
He has to ask permission each time he goes to 
pick 
it as the owner of the pond has had problems with 
trespassing fishermen, as the pond 
is stocked with bass. 
Every evening he tells his wife where he'll be going the 
next morning. 
Plants shipped via UPS; they pick up at his back 
door. 
He'll deliver himself if people live close by. 
A guy 
in 
Camden Co. expects him, because he's a "piney," to deliver for 
nothing. 
Leo comments, "No way is he going to deliver to that 
guy for nothing." 
Leo says he's the only one who handles the Joe-Pye; it's 
hard to cure as the whole flower goes "to pot" in just a few 
days. 
I ask about samples of "cycas" (looks like a palm frond) 
which he says are from Florida; he'd bought a large batch some 
years ago for a good price; still selling from that batch. 
Immortelle is the only plant he sells that has odor, 
in response 
to my query about the importance of smell 
in his plant business. 
He notes that the immortelle sample he's working on was collected 
too 
late; 
it 
is shedding seeds (dandelion like); 
in such cases 
the plants need to be shaken out to get rid of the fluff. 
Joe-
pye poses similar problems. 
I ask how far he ships flowers. 
He had earlier noted that 
he ships to a customer in Australia. 
He cited Minnesota, 
Maryland, Boston, etc. 
He advertises in florist magazines and 
they put out their catalog. 
He believes his success is due 
mainly to the grapevine, friend to friend recommendations, word 
of mouth. 
I ask about a plant drying in the shed: he says it's "marsh 
grass, "at least, that's what we call 
it," a kind of sedge, he 
adds by way of clarification (it does appear to be Cyperaceae: 
EH7) 
A bad year for this "marsh grass," the dry weather did 
it 
Hunn--$3 Fieldnotes 
page 3 
in, 
it only grew about 1/2 as tall 
as normal, as 
last year. 
Leo 
considers this past summer's drought the worst dry spell 
in a 
Ion  time. 
(An aside about England from Leo, where he served during the 
war: "you could cut loose the dirigibles and let 
it sink for what 
it's worth" (roughly quoted: EH).) 
All four of thus then walked over to their greenhouse and 
went in. 
Temperature in the afternoon sun about 120 degrees (my 
estimate). 
Leo described the heat inside in mid summer: so hot 
you couldn't walk barefoot inside. 
Pine cones being heated, 
covering an area of floor about 4x8 feet (rough estimate), 
several deep. 
He turns them over and talks about how he'll get 
out tomorrow at dawn to pick the open ones out so the rest will 
open quicker. 
Apparently he had never before tried opening his 
pine cones 
in the greenhouse, rather had used the heating shed 
with wood burning barrel stove heat. 
The cones cured 
in the 
greenhouse don't turn as dark as the ones cured by the stove 
heat. 
Peppergrass (Lepidium sp., I think) hung up to dry: Leo 
says it's so called because it tasted hot, 
like pepper, when the 
plant is green. 
Hazel comments on drying plants in the sun 
versus in the dark; do 
it 
in the dark (of the heating shed?) 
if 
you don't want to bleach the plants. 
Leo notes that some of the 
cones being dried are from last year (when picked?); says you can 
"pink even those old enough to vote." 
Pine cones sold by the 
500, approximately 13 lbs.; he goes by the weight; customers have 
not complained (i.e., that there are fewer than 500 in a bag). 
He gets $10 or so, 
it varies, per bag; he says we should consult 
the catalog or ask Hazel about pricing, as "that's her 
department." 
On cutting bayberry: he sells both seed and sprays; due to 
dry spell, the "red aronia" berries gone ("red aronia"?). 
He 
describes two varieties of "aronia" berries, red and black, 
called in vernacular "red chokeberry" and "black chokeberry." 
Query about feeding birds: They buy birdseed by the 100 lb. 
sack; also feed birds pine seeds and bayberry seeds of their own. 
Birds also like to feed on the dogwood fruits on the trees 
in the 
yard. 
Hazel continues, listing the birds that she's seen at her 
feeders (3 feeding sites in the yard, 2 feeders and the third 
just on the ground): first she notes an unfamiliar bird she saw 
just once recently, 
like a sparrow but with a "moss green back" 
(no telling what: EH). 
Purple finch came once, special; lots of 
cardinals, blue jays, chickadees (with prompt from Leo) catbirds, 
"brown thrush" (?: EH), "ground robin," 3-4 kinds of sparrows, 
she doesn't know what kinds, says she wants to get a good pair of 
binoculars and a bird book. 
Also has had Baltimore oriole and a 
largish yellow backed bird that feeds on the ground, one that 
just appears sporadically, possible (Evening) grosbeak. 
Blue jay 
but not cardinals at feeder in summer. 
She suggests I come at 3 
P. 
M. 
if I want to see the birds, as that's when Leo puts out the 
Hunn--83 Fieldnotes 
page 4 
food, and the birds know when it's feeding time. 
Especially good 
in winter. 
Mockingbirds in the spring, she later identified a 
mockingbird that flew up onto her TV antennae. 
Also they put out 
suet for the downy (or "little red—headed") woodpecker (she uses 
both terms) and for the titmice. 
Hazel says she was born and raised 
in the Pinelands (though 
Leo born in Philly he now looks just like a local). 
Hazel then 
reminisced about the first years of their marriage, when Leo was 
stationed in the panhandle of Texas. 
She went down to visit him 
there, had a hard time with the local people. They were mostly 
Germans and asked too many questions of her, as about when and 
where Leo was to be sent (Germans were the enemy!). 
Hazel pointed out dogwood tree 
in her yard; not used 
in the 
business, just nice to 
look at 
in the spring, when it blooms. 
She also identified the sycamores in the yard, aka "buttonwood." 
One of their sycamores is now dead, killed by the dog, which was 
chained next to 
it; 
rubbed through the bark, killing the tree, 
chain. 
Later she spoke of problems with her son; getting him to 
help around the house. He has drinking problem and she doesn't 
trust him to be able to climb the tree with the chain saw to cut 
it down. 
It poses a danger if a hurricane should blow through. 
Also 
in yard: white pine. 
Hazel and Leo married 1942. 
Leo was 
then working for the Bassett Nursery, had been working there 
during the depression. 
Murray Bassett, Sr., founded the 
business, a self—taught botanist. His son, Murray, Jr., and 
grandson Bill, carried on. 
Bill Barrett shifted into frozen food 
business during WWII and lost everything. 
Leo started his own 
floral business. Hazel worried they lived too close, 
it wouldn't 
have been right to compete, but Bill had changed his business, so 
ok. 
On seasonality, Hazel: no work late December to July now. 
Used to harvest something in spring but no 
longer (I didn't catch 
what). 
Leo identified "foxtail millet," a grass growing by the 
heating shed 
in his back yard; also "bittersweet," a vine he used 
to sell 
but it's (government) controlled now. 
It has orange 
seeds that pop open; used now in wreaths. 
Hazel adds that 
bittersweet has separate male and female plants, 
like holly, 
in 
response to Elaine's prod. 
She says the bittersweet grows wild 
(is native to?) the Allegheny Mtns. 
Leo identified a packet of 
dried Cruciferae as "dago broccoli," aka "Italian broccoli," or 
"rape" (pronounced "rap"). 
He bought his supply off a farmer 
after the broccoli harvest. 
Hazel and Leo discuss Leo's uncanny close resemblance to 
Jack Richardson, a piney also 
in the flower/weed business. 
Richardson apparently looks exactly like Leo's brother (now 
deceased). 
This despite the fact that Leo born 
in Philly, not in 
the Pines. 
Hunn--83 Fieldnotes 
page 5 
(Immortelle?), according to Hazel, the only "funeral flower" 
in her Grandmother's time. 
Points to another plant called 
"coffee grass"; she doesn't know why it's called that. 
"Reed 
plume" (Phragmites in flower) grows at edge of water. 
Another 
plant is "hardhack," 
it has a pink flower (Spiraea: EH). 
Another 
is 
"sand grass," which grows all 
up and down the coast on the 
sand dunes (Leo joining in here). 
Leo quips, "What they (the 
government people who prohibit harvest of "sand grass" from beach 
dunes) don't know about that plant'd fill five bibles," this 
passed off with superb elan. 
Bulldozers of the big Atlantic City 
developers are the real problem; the government does nothing 
about them. 
Another plant is "yarrow": 
it comes in white, pink, 
and yellow, as here. 
You could call 
it "yellow yarrow," in 
response to query. 
Leo seems amused by the alliteration. 
The 
yellow variety is cultivated. 
Another plant, "horse oats" they 
call 
it, 
is also a cultivated plant. 
Another plant in the shed: 
"nut grass," they don't get it anymore (Looks like Scirpus: EH). 
This (or another) "orange grass" grows in ditches, has purple 
flowers, but doesn't sell well. 
They identify milkweed pods 
in a 
box 
in the shed. 
Hazel talks of a book she bought at the store at Batsto (at 
the State Forest Interpretive Center there) about weeds, she 
recommends it. 
It 
is, 
"All About Weeds" by Edwin Rollin Spencer, 
a Dover Nature book. 
Their shed 
is full 
of round grape vine 
basket bases (with grape vine handles) for wholesale to florists. 
They did sell dried ferns one year (but not usually). 
"Squirrel— 
tail grass" (?). 
"Goose grass" grows at New Gretna shore. 
Never 
get enough of 
it. 
Consulting the weed book we find that their 
"Yellow foxtail/foxtail millet" is "Wild Millet" or Setaria, 
according to the book. 
Also fide the book: "peppergrass".is 
Lepidium virginicum. 
They pioneered acorn sprays in the market; all sold out. 
No 
use for plantain; they no 
longer sell mullein, except the "moth 
mullein," which they call 
"cherry bell" (i.e., Verbascum 
blattaria), or "verbiscum," fide Leo. 
Hazel comments on the 
beauty of Jimsonweed; but it grows more in North Jersey, it's 
poisonous, but they had one 
in their yard at one time. 
I ask about coming back 
in December to watch the birds at 
their feeder and to continue plant discussions; Hazel says fine. 
Hazel notes that the "brown thrush" (brown thrasher or wood 
thrush?: EH) eats berries in their yard, of pokeweed (Phytolacca 
americana:EH); though the vegetation is poisonous the berries are 
ok. 
Hazel shows us two birds nests they have saved with the 
branches, one 
in a bayberry, the other unfinished, that of a red— 
winged blackbird in a cattail. 
Leo says they have red—winged 
blackbirds in the area. 
Leo explains their cattail situation: 
they sell four sizes, the "mini cat," "small miniature cat," 
large miniature cat," and "jumbo cat." 
The first three are just 
three sizes of the "narrow—leaved cattail," depending on its age, 
Hunn--83 Fieldnotes 
page 6 
the jumbo is the broad—leaved rattail. 
Leo notes that the broad— 
leaved cat grows in fresh water, the other in brackish. 
They 
also have some "melaleuca," ada "eucalyptus," that they bought 
from Florida. 
Hazel shows two other books of hers, purchased at the same 
Batsto store: How to Know Wild Fruits, by Maude Gridley Peterson 
(Dover), and How to Know the Ferns, by Frances Theodora Parsons 
(Dover). 
She suggests we 
look up Annie Carter, a botanist, 
scotch, who works at the Batsto store and post office. 
She's is 
apparently some sort of naturalist there, does guided tours, may 
take us on one. 
We should use Hazel's name by way of 
introduction. 
Other plants displayed on wall but not in the collection 
Hazel prepared for us: "turkey beard" (Xerophyllus 
asphodeloides), "cornettes" (apparently the tassels of corn, Zea 
mays), "Jersey statice" aka "sea lavender," and "dock" (Rumex 
sp.). 
They then talked of problems with fire, with local kids 
setting fires; they lost their whole stock in 1974 when somebody 
set Johnson's barn afire. 
They had a small fire in Leo's drying 
shed, but Leo says it was not a problem; he put it out. 
Leo 
is 
an "exempt volunteer fireman," he's put in 
all his required (?> 
years. 
No 
it's not "required," Hazel clarifies. 
They compare "German statice," which is commercially grown 
(they had some 
in a box), and "Jersey statice," which grows in 
meadows where there's lots of water (=sea lavender). 
100 Ibs of 
cattail dries to 10 
Ibs, says Leo 
in stressing importance of 
drying operation. 
His barrel stove, 
in the work shed, was 
purchased for $50 including a kit with door, 
legs, and pipe 
outlet. 
Bought from a man in Ohio who sells kits. 
Leo says they also get "blackbirds," aka "just blackbird," 
i.e., not red—winged blackbirds. (Note contrast of red—winged 
blackbird versus "just blackbird," probably the rusty blackbird: 
EH). 
Hazel says they made "grave blankets" last christmas. 
Hazel relieved to have us visit, provided diversion from problems 
with son and daughter—in—law regarding drinking. 
I asked Hazel about a strong scented yellow composite 
growing in her fallow garden. 
"Just a wild flower." 
(Later 
identified by EH as camphorweed.) 
I asked Hazel for a definition 
of weed, as that's the term Leo uses to describe the plants they 
collect, process, and se►I, collectively. 
She dodged saying, "I 
don't know."

TX04: Conversation with Brad Thompson at headquarters after 
dinner. 
Brad dropped by headquarters about 7:30 P.M. 
looking for 
either Christine or Mary. 
As we expected Mary back soon we 
invited him to sit in the kitchen with me and (off and on) Joe 
and Elaine. 
The first hour of our conversation was not recorded 
in my notes, which is unfortunate as Brad was speaking eagerly 
and with clarity and 
in detail about his perception of his life 
as a born and raised Pinelands person. 
He 
is now working toward 
a Master's degree in Environmental Design (?) at the U of Penn 
while working half time for the National Park Service/Pinelands 
Commission as some sort of consultant. 
He spoke of long standing 
conflicts among local families, 
in particular, conflict between 
his family and his neighbor (and perhaps back 200-300 years, 
relative) Mary-Ann Thompson. 
He takes considerable pride, he 
evens an old score, by having achieved the status of Penn grad, 
thus no 
longer need feel 
inferior to the more wealthy local 
families, such as Haines, or to upper middle class city folks. 
Brad strongly advised me to contact Mary-Ann Thompson's aunt 
(but don't mention Mary-Ann's name, just Brad's), Marie Coville 
Thompson (now Ortner). 
She 
is 62 years old and lives 
in Roxbury, 
NY (phone 607-326-7902). 
She 
is Frederick Coville's 
granddaughter (He 
is the famous botanist.) and holds still many 
of his papers and some original plant specimens. 
She would like 
to find an appropriate repository for them. 
Perhaps the Library 
of Congress, Brad suggests. 
Brad 
is concerned about the possible health effects of 
spraying of chemicals in their blueberry fields by his father. 
He notes with some concern that Marie Coville Thompson's husband, 
Vinton Thompson, and Brad's father, Jack Thompson, both had 
kidney tumors, which Brad's father survived. 
He wondered whether 
perhaps now blueberry farmers may even be using Paraquat, but he 
wasn't sure. 
He worries because the Tru-Blu Coop stores 
pesticides where they could get into the watershed if there were 
a disaster. 
Brad also has recently suffered from allergies. 
Chemicals in use include "Captan," perhaps a fungicide, and 
Malathion, used against "stunt," a disease which stunts the 
plants, caused by some insect. 
The Tru-Blu Coop was founded by Stanley Coville, Frederick 
Coville's son. 
Little known fart: this coop pioneered the use of 
cellophane in this country, ca 1920, introduced idea from Europe. 
Brad's family is #46 of over 200 in the coop, thus joined early 
on. 
We talked about the blueberry farming business. 
Brad's 
Hunn--83 Fieldnotes 
page 8 
father hopes that Brad and his brother (both unmarried; Brad 27, 
his brother John Wesley Thompson III 37) will take on the 
business. 
As 
it 
is now, their father works hard all winter, 
pruning, etc., while the brothers do most of the work of 
harvesting in summer. 
Major pests of blueberries include deer; 
they can make short work of a field, so blueberry farmers near 
G—Vincentown; 23GT (his home area) must fence their fields. 
His 
family 
works 37 acres intensively. 
Other pests include dodder 
(?) and greenbriar (Smilax) which climb on the blueberry plants. 
These controlled by hand application of chemicals. 
The harvest is over for this year. 
They plant 6 varieties. 
Primarily in order to control the harvest timing. For example, 
they don't plant late maturing berries because they like a 
vacation in August. 
Varieties vary 
in size, taste, color; some 
are sweet, others bland, others pithy. 
Beekeepers essential for 
pollination. 
His family pays beekeepers $500 per year to bring 
their bees to their fields, and, he wryly notes, they don't even 
get a complementary jar of honey anymore, times have changed. 
Brad suggested I ask Marie for the name of a bee person, on the 
mount in Mt. Holly (?), connected with Rutgers in some way. 
This 
bee person worked with holly trees to develop more productive 
holly crop, that is, bigger berries and shinier leaves. 
This 
man, Brad forgot his name. died just last year. 
Discussing difference between blueberries and huckleberries: 
apparently huckleberries have just 6-7 seeds while blueberries 
have many more small seeds, thus huckleberries seedier? 
Old 
blueberry strains named "cabots," "Covilles," "catherines" after 
Marie's aunt Cathering and her uncles Cabot and Coville. 
Middle 
aged varieties include Herbert, Wolcott, and Weymouth, again 
named after people. 
New varieties are like #287, "whites," 
"June," "Blue Crop," "Berkeley," "Blue—gray." (More mundane:EH) 
Coop controls what varieties are planted by member families 
through their quality control. 
Earliest maturing varieties may 
be picked as early as June 15. 
This past year they lost about 
2000 flats (of how many? 20,000?) due to drought, though Brad did 
not consider this a serious loss. 
He claimed that other farmers, 
those less careful to prune, etc., 
lost much more. 
Worse than 
drought, 
in Brad's opinion, 
is too much rain, as blueberries mold 
easily. 
Ironically, plants that are adapted to growing 
in damper 
soils suffer most from drought, because their root systems are 
shallower. 
Bushes lost this past drought were a few growing on 
wettest soils. 
Blueberry bushes may set some fruit after 4 years but don't 
hit their stride until at least 8 years old. 
For several years 
thereafter plants may double yields each successive year until 
they level out, but only 
if carefully pruned. 
Business decisions 
in Brad's family shared: Brad's father knows pruning best, his 
mother knows diseases best. She always carefully checks plants to 
discover first signs of disease. 
Brad's brother is a school 
Hunn--83 Fieldnotes 
page 9 
teacher in Chatsworth; blueberry harvest dovetails perfectly with 
school year. 
During frosts this past year they lost 2 acres of 
plants on a slope. 
Can't really control effects of frost; 
irrigation possible but not feasible since vandals destroyed 
their irrigation system. 
During Great Depression his family subsisted well enough on 
their farm. 
Now they are not threatened by developers. 
His 
parents have 14 acres on Retreat Rd. they would like to be able 
to develop (in part) for retirement income, but commission won't 
allow it. 
Real estate: 
lots around Vincentown sell for 6-10,000 
dollars per lots of 1 to 1.5 acres. 
He and his brother would 
rather live 
in Vincentown than outside of town. 
Comment on Bill Wasowich: not native, a Ukrainian wood 
carver, came here from Trenton some years ago. 
Brad said that living in the Pines gave him respect for 
blacks; he recalls the strong characters, both male and female, 
of black people who worked on his family's farm; perhaps they may 
occasionally "double—dip" social security, but at bottom they are 
hard working people. 
He spoke very critically of the Pinelands Commission, 
especially its outsider bias, 
lack of knowledge firsthand of 
farming, etc. 
His life's goals now include helping reconstruct 
the depressed urban cores of Camden and Philly; he believes it 
can and should be done, with federal seed money for starters.

TX02: Visit to Bill (spelled "Willian" on his truck) Wasowich. 
G-Woodmansie; 27GT 
Bill 
lives 
in a about 1920's house owned by the Electric 
Company. 
He pays about $1000/yr for house and about 1.5 acres of 
land. 
The house is next to the old Conrail track; a hunting club 
lodge 
is 
on the other side of the tracks. 
Hunters partying there 
during our 7 A.M.-9 A.M. visit. 
The turn off to his house is 
from State Rte 72 at 5.8 mi 
east of headquarters. 
We woke him up 
as he doesn't work on Sundays. 
Bill 
had just "pulled" a truck load of (sphagnum) moss 
yesterday, so didn't plan to go anywhere today. 
Joseph 
introduced us and spoke of their common acquaintance, Chris. 
Bill allowed as how he recollected Chris, laconically, with a 
near painful shyness, eyes downcast, battered unlaced boots 
toeing the dust of his porch. 
We asked if he'd mind showing us 
the shed he'd built of cast off railroad ties, an imposing 
edifice which may never fall down. 
Why did he build 
it with air 
alternating with each tie? Joe asked. 
It was easier, he replied. 
Also, he didn't mind (or care?) showing us his place. 
Inside he had a power lathe which he had used to do some 
woodcarving which didn't amount to much, by Bill's estimation. 
He doesn't carve much anymore as he couldn't sell them. 
One set 
of carved large chessmen, also turned on the lathe, sit on a post 
in front of his door. 
Also in the shed: a rather new blueberry 
cleaning & sorting machine which he'd picked up for $600. 
Why? 
I never did figure out, as he didn't seem to be 
in that business, 
though he used to do work 
in cranberry fields. 
The remains of 
dried moss from his last load on the floor. 
Also 
in the shed were several bundles of narrow-leaf 
cattails, bound up much as I'd seen yesterday at Landy's. 
He has 
cut as many as 14,000 in 3 days work; find at shore; cut with 
regular knife; pull off 
leaves; cut to size. 
Gets about $8/100 
for cattails. 
Sells mostly to Allen, 9 miles up the road at 
Whiting; Allen buys most of the cones, cattails, etc., around 
Hunn--83 Fieldnotes 
page 12 
here according to Bill. 
Knows of Landy but doesn't believe he 
does that much business. 
We noted also about 12 cedar poles, barked and trimmed and 
cut into 5-6 foot lengths. 
Average diameter about 2 inches. 
Warren Grove best area for picking pine cones. 
Most 
people--of the few who do 
it--pick on the Navy target range, 
target for parachute drop practice, not bombing! 
Bill picks 
cones along Rte. 72 (also?). 
Says he's heard of state buying a 
piece of 
land there, prohibiting cone harvest. 
He just sold 150 bales of moss to the state (forest); they 
need 
it for shipping pines, spruce, etc. 
Paid $1 a bushel = $5 a 
bale. 
Uses same bushel bucket carried by a canvas strap wired to 
the bucket/wash tub's handles for pine cones and for moss. 
Also 
in the shed were bundles of "sugar huck(leberry)" which he sells 
to Allen for $7/bundle. 
You cut sugar huck bushes in the winter, 
when the leaves have fallen. 
Just outside of the shed 
is another tool 
he made, this used 
as a vise to hold cedar poles for debarking, etc. 
Made of a 
plank of thick wood about 8 feet long supported by four wooded 
legs each about 2 feet long. 
A rectangular wood frame fit 
vertically around the plank which could be wedged in place over a 
smaller plank to hold the object being worked on. 
The small cattails are best because they must be small to 
dry properly. 
1.5 bushels to a bag of pine cones; can pick 10 bags 
in a 
day. 
Cone harvests are good year after year, though you have to 
look for good spots. 
Bill was born in Trenton; has been picking pine cones, etc., 
for about 12 years. 
Most other people who do this kind of work 
are drunks, bums, who want to earn just enough for a drink. 
Some 
people now cut birch but not him. 
Sold for decorations. 
You can pick moss in fall and 
it will keep well wet over the 
winter, until May, because of 
low temperatures. 
Rots after that. 
Moss often used for grave blankets. 
Croshaw (has nursery at ?) 
mixes moss with sawdust,, wraps around plant roots. 
Bill has sold 
Croshaw as much as 800 bushels @ 50 bushels/truckload. 
You may 
have to pick cranberry vines, etc., out of the moss; 
it depends 
on where you pull 
it. 
Bill clearly described the ecological successional 
situation; he noted that moss will grow back 
in 3-4 years 
if 
in 
full sunlight; moss particularly abundant following cutting of 
cedar from bog. 
We discussed problems he encounters with 
landowners; he prefers to "pull moss" close to home, where he 
knows everybody; as at Chatsworth, on Haines property he can pull 
Hunn--83 Fieldnotes 
page 13 
it without hassle. 
This past year "a bad year," as he pulled 
only 150 bales, rather than say 500. 
Why a bad year? 
Drought? 
No, he just didn't get any more. 
Now is cranberry harvest season. 
Workers are paid hourly + 
a bonus 
if they stick on the job to the season's end. 
Many don't 
like to. 
Length of season depends on size of place; can keep 
picking until freeze-up. 
Bill's house previously used as the office for a clay mining 
operation nearby. 
Now defunct. 
Wild huckleberries good to eat; he eats some. 
Wild grapes 
(identified near yard from leaf sample) no good for eating. 
He 
doesn't collect grape vines because "it's not worth it." 
Bill 
says, "There's hardly anything in the woods that somebody doesn't 
use" (rough quote). 
Birch now collected around Browns Mills. 
20-30 people 
(often bums, drunks) involved in birch collecting. 
To "pull moss" one needs a bushel (wash)tub, a rake (he had 
a seemingly homemade wooden rake, with 14 wooden tines about 2 
inches long, handle about 5 feet long wlmetal joint), 
wheelbarrow, pitchfork, and a pickup truck. 
He usually has to 
lay some planks to get the truck in close enough. 
Pinelands has stopped big development, but didn't stop small 
developments, 
like people putting up houses. 
This he doesn't 
like to see. 
Suggests government may have to buy up the land to 
stop 
it 
Use for "bull briar": people make wreaths of 
it, 
but not of 
the small briar growing on the tree near his shed (Smilax sp.). 
Allen's (Allyn's Manufactury?:SS) business not open Sunday. 
Bill also used to sell 
to Jack Richardson, maybe he lives near 
Whitestown. 
For Rubus hispidus growing at his feet: "just wild 
blackberries," not eaten. 
Bill burns railroad ties for fuel 
in 
his house rather than cut firewood. 
We ask about a seeming 
antique wagon, with 4 ft metal wheels; he says he bought it at an 
antique store; refitted it. 
Bill allows as how he has some 
bottles he's collected about old foundations; pulls out a box 
quick as anything; which Joe buys for $10! 
Bill had had trouble 
selling them. 
He thought the antique stores had too many 
already. 
For "a change of pace" he sometimes goes bottle hunting 
still. 
Poison ivy doesn't bother him. 
Sand ticks however are a 
bother during real hot weather. 
As for birds, bugs, etc., Bill 
says he "doesn't pay any attention to 
'em." 
Just goes about his 
Hunn--83 Fieldnotes 
page 14 
business. 
Does he recall John McPhee? 
Yes, he's from Princeton, but 
he's not been back since writing the book. 
He's read it; doesn't 
think much of the writing (apparently critical of McPhee's craft 
or style, not of the content). 
I asked if he'd ever thought of 
writing himself. 
He said no. 
"Picking cones": 
He goes out to get a load; 
if he needs 10 
bags, he'll pick 10 bags, @ $5 bag; 1.5 bags/bushel; 1.5 bags/hr. 
He wears leather gloves to protect hands from pitch, prickles on 
cones. 
Just get cones on the Plains, don't know what kind they 
are (of pine tree). 
Picks cones in winter; when it snows he 
works 
in his cellar rather than go out. 
He's thinking of planting a garden, maybe he'll grow corn, 
but deer and "groundhogs" are pests; need to bury fence 3 feet 
deep to keep out groundhogs--agrees with Joe on this point. 
Joe 
reports seeing groundhogs, big and fat, nearby a short while ago. 
Otherwise not many around. 
Bill figures they like 
it here 
because there are lots of old houses. 
No, he hasn't tried to eat 
groundhogs, though Bill says they're ok, taste like pork. 
They 
hibernate. 
Agreed to take us out to pick pine cones Tuesday, 11 Oct., 
about 9 A.M. 
Warming to our questions and chit chat by now. 
He 
mentions the "colored guy, Paine, used to make charcoal," have we 
looked him up? 
I enquired about an odd wooded sawhorse, also 
homemade. 
Not much to say about it. 
Wondered if we'd studied or 
run 
into anybody cutting "salt hay." 
Were we writing a book 
about this? 
Joe explained and gave him our card.

TXO1: Tom Brown, Trapper, of Millville/Cumberland G—Maurice River; 
38GT 
Joe Czarnecki and I left headquarters about 7:15 A.M. en 
route via Hwy 206 & 54. 
Stopped briefly 
in G—Buena; 02GT 
(pronounced b—yu'na) looking for yard sculpture at CB Auto there. 
Noted location for return trip. 
Tom & Muriel Brown live 200 
yards south of Rte 49, 
1.7 miles east 
of the Rte 55 overpass 
east of Millville town center. 
He lives on 10 acres left him by 
his father; his daughter and son—in—law live 100 yards east. 
Tom 
& Muriel very warm, energetic, engaged, 
loquacious, both talking 
at once at full speed non—stop. 
Four hours recorded on cassette 
and many rolls of film. 
What folklorists must dream of. 
Tom & Muriel have been married 52 years; he celebrates 
important life events with clever and heart—felt rhyme, many of 
which he will 
recall with little encouragement and without 
hesitation. 
Several examples are on tape. 
After an hour's 
discussion around the kitchen table with them both, about family 
and trapping, etc., he gave us a guided tour of his two museums 
(!), trappers' 
lodge, garden, etc. He 
is an 
inveterate collector 
of memorabilia, including numerous Civil War mementoes of 
considerable value. 
His home seems to be an informal headquarters 
for the South Jersey Fur—takers Association Chapter 14A. 
For 
details see PFP83—AEH001-004. 
Plants noted 
in his yard and associated woods include a lone 
Pitch Pine (all that's left of original pines), white oak, black 
oak, chestnut oak, scrub oak, "laurel," hickory, plus planted 
"upland cedar" (red cedar), sycamore, willow, black walnut, etc. 
His daughter's family has planted a field in scots pine for 
christmas tree sales. 
Shrubs and herbs include "teaberry" 
(Gaultheria procumbens, 
in fruit) (good for teas), wild 
blackberries (Rubus spp.), "cow huckleberry" (seedy, not so 
good), (trailing) arbutus; garden crops include "sugar corn," 
tomatoes, bell peppers, gooseberry, watermelon (didn't do well 
this year due to drought), zuchini and summer squash, pumpkin, 
lima beans, etc.; weeds include "morning glory" (Ipomeoea 
purpurea), "ragweed" (Amaranthus sp.), etc. 
Hunn--83 Fieldnotes 
page 16 
After taping ended: Tom and Muriel told story of Tom's 
broken neck, from 1963 auto accident; broadsided by a reckless 
kid; got minimal compensation despite long hospital stay & near 
death of paralysis. 
Muriel "taught Tom how to walk again" during 
recuperation. 
Doctors criticized implicitly for misdiagnosis and 
overuse of drugs to control pain. 
First said he had arthritis; 
Tom worked for several months with broken neck! 
Finally realized 
it was broken and had operation. 
Muriel described her homemade (and grown) luncheon stew as 
"poor man's soup." 
Tom suffered from Tic Doloreau, "worst pain 
known to man," and several times on the verge of suicide because 
of 
it. 
Doctors have controlled it fairly well during past few 
years. 
Cold weather used to bring 
it on. 
So he wears a 
(balaclava?) face mask when trapping in winter and grew his beard 
for protection. 
Tom would not have survived these troubles 
(including loss at 3 years of one daughter) 
if not for his Indian 
blood. 
Tom's mother's father a Delaware (Lenni—Lenape) Indian; used 
to make baskets of white oak roots. 
Tom has no examples in his 
collection, though he does have some stone pestles, etc., found 
locally. 
Tom & Muriel great admirers of Indians but this respect 
not extended in general to "colored people." 
Believes Martin 
Luther King to be a communist, etc. 
Some related commentary off— 
the—record at their request. 
Tom's daughter is an RN, "knows 
more than doctors." 
Muriel had all 
but her last child at home; sister—in—law 
served as midwife, for $10 per delivery (Tom has check stubs to 
prove it). 
Youngest born 1943 in hospital--10 days 
hospitalization and all 
fees totaled $46. 
Tom showed off a carving set with antler handles he'd 
attached. 
He makes numerous useful 
items of deer antler; the 
antlers often picked up after they've been shed. 
Muriel asked us about "Pineys." 
Are they really "rough"? 
Tom says, No, they're just like us, 
living off the land; "really 
tough ones are 
in North Jersey, descended from Hessians, killed a 
game warden up there." 
Talked of religion; Tom expressed liberal sentiments; his 
niece and her husband (living in Florida) are atheists; "some of 
nicest people I know are atheists," though professed not to 
understand how one could not believe after witnessing wonder of 
nature (Muriel) or horror of war (Tom). 
Tom says he hates motorcycles, calls them "Japanese's 
revenge" as they've killed more than in the war. 
Told story of a 
local 
12 yr old kid killed when he ran 
into a gravel truck, the 
kid not watching where he was going. 
Incredulous that the father 
Hunn--83 Fieldnotes 
page 17 
said (at the funeral?) the boy had "lived a full 
life"; Tom did 
not think so, though it criminal to 
let (or encourage) kids to 
ride motorcycles. 
This boy had run a trap line for muskrat; his 
dog missed him so he went out and brought back one of the boy's 
traps with a muskrat in 
it (after he was killed). 
Tom complains of "sand holes," end product of sand mining 
operations in his area. 
Says they are lowering the water table, 
polluting. 
Muriel asked 
if we had been to Port Norris; mostly "colored" 
live there, 
in poor unkempt shacks; known for their work songs 
and spirituals; oyster shuckers. music 
Told joke about family from Delmont/Eldora (?); couple with 
16 kids 
in a two room shack. 
Put kids to bed two by two; moved 
them out onto the floor as soon as they went to sleep, then put 
two more down, until finally they were all 
asleep on the floor, 
they got 
in bed themselves. 
Told joke about dog that was so smart, when its owner would 
carve a (coon hide) stretcher (of wood), he'd run out and come 
back with a noon just the right size; the man would carve a 
larger one and the dog would come back with a bigger coon. 
Then 
one day the man decided to go to town so he got out his ironing 
board; the dog ran out and they haven't seen him since! 
Tom mostly traps at G—Corbin City; 04GT state lands, 9000 
acres of brackish marsh there; plus he may set traps en route 
from Miliville, though often these areas set by others early. 
A 
good day for him is 25-26 rats; the retired state trooper he 
spoke of earlier could bring in up to 68 in a day, but he covered 
lots of country. 
A man he'd heard of, with hired help, brought 
in 367 rats in one day. 
Critical of some trappers who go out on the opening day and 
just set out stakes, no traps, to keep out other trappers. 
Tom 
doesn't do that. 
Tom discussed problem with freezing weather; 
your traps might be frozen in on the first day and you may not 
get them out until after the season closes March 15th. 
So 
trapper needs to keep extra traps on hand. 
"State hoppers" are trappers that travel from state to state 
trapping. 
They must be careful of changeable state laws or they 
could be fined and have their skins and license confiscated, as 
in a case he cited. 
Spraying and pollution have reduced furbearers in his 
area, have harmed the "meadows." 
Tom told stories of hauling coal 
in his truck from mines 
west of Reading, Pa., losing brakes on mtn roads, etc. 
This but 
one of the jobs he worked at during his life, 
in addition to 
Hunn--83 Fieldnotes 
page 18 
trapping, which can bring 
in only about $10,000/yr. 
"Your woman must go along with your trapping (i.e., put up 
with it at least) or you can't do 
it." 
Query: Do women ever 
trap? 
Yes, 
indeed; he cited case of a woman in Georgia that was 
expert. 
Muriel says she doesn't like snakes, spiders, or lizards; 
Tom liked to tease her by scaring her with snakes (he 
let a pine 
snake--6.5 ft long--loose 
in the house one time; 
it bit him, 
leaving minute scar) or rubber spiders from novelty shops! 
Says 
he doesn't do 
it anymore, doesn't want to give her a heart 
attack. 
Tom & Muriel now like to travel; have been 
in 40 states, 
mostly on bus tours 
in their later years (since retirement from 
wage work 
in 1972). 
Son lives 
in Sausalito, Ca., with his 
Chinese—American wife; they've visited him there & loved it. 
Have visited Colorado ski 
areas in summer; Tom recalled seeing 
his first hummingbird nest there (subsequently found one near his 
home). 
Stories of gambling in Reno and Atlantic City; many jackpots 
on slot machines. 
Muriel allows as how she doesn't like to 
gamble, doesn't believe it's right, but loves to win! Their 
daughter met her husband in Atlantic City. 
He's from a wealthy 
family and was first aghast at how Tom & Muriel 
lived (in the 
"wilderness"), but now they get along fine; he loves her cooking 
and she doesn't feel shy about his breeding anymore. 
Now he 
"fits right in" at their house. 
Tom will describe the tanning process on another visit. 
Tom shows slides of George Fisher, a "snapperer" 43-44 yrs 
old, but a loner (he won't talk to us); a perfectionist who runs 
a very clean and efficient operation; gets $0.45/lb now for 
snappers sold to restaurants. 
Ed Meredith, now of Tumwater, Wa., supplies trapping gear; a 
friend of Tom's. 
We noticed a hard bound copy of The Tracker on Tom's book 
shelf (also a copy of McPhee, etc.) and so enquired as to what he 
thought of the "other Tom Brown." 
He smiled and said he took 
most of 
it with a grain of salt; believed the part about the wild 
dogs though, as he'd had similar experiences himself; not so sure 
anybody could track a person through the woods like in the book 
however; also skeptical about the Indian; but enjoyed the book 
apparently. 
His daughter bought the book for him and suggested 
he read 
it. 
Showed us the patio and chimney he'd built of stone out 
back. 
He brought stone back from different parts of the country. 
Hunn--$3 Fieldnotes 
page 19 
Also included indigenous Jersey sandstone, called "iron stone" 
because of high iron content (I took a sample.). 
Stone measured 
by the "perch," which he understood to be about the same as a 
"cord" for wood. 
Stone cutters sounded for it with a metal bar. 
Cumberland Pond near Tuckahoe remains from iron mining operation; 
you can still find slag there. 
Tom pointed out a Red Fox track in a patch of smooth sand 
along his drive way; says you can tell 
it's not a gray fox 
because of the shape of the track; not cat-like. 
Also showed us 
deer tracks in the garden; bucks' tracks have more spread toes. 
Unusual weather this year; flowers still blooming as there 
was no frost this September during full moon as 
is typical; but 
he expects it will frost this coming full moon. 
Both red and gray foxes sound alike, but gray foxes can 
climb trees well, not the reds. 
He 
labeled a 1 foot tall 
black/scarlet oak "scrub oak" without hesitation when I asked 
what kind it was. 
We are enthusiastically invited to return; even to sleep 
over in the deer hunters' cabin out back and to use their shower.

TX02: William D. Clark, G-Buena; 02GT junk sculptor 
On hot tip we located the CB Auto Parts place (phone 561-
4463) about 5 miles north of Buena on Rte. 54, east side. 
Mr. 
Clark, who works at CB auto, had on display about 10 sculptures 
of humanoid and bird forms, made by welding old car and motor 
parts in amusing and life-like poses reminiscent of "Star Wars" 
and "ET". Mr. Clark reports that quite a few people have asked 
him to make them similar pieces (he has apparently sold a few). 
Clark studied art 
in high school and at Trenton State College and 
had done quite a lot of drawing for his own amusement before 
trying his hand at this sculpture beginning 7 months ago. 
TX03: Miscellaneous plant notes. 
Collected at Brown's G-Millville; 
GT place: trailing arbutus 
(Epigaea repens); an upright Rubus sp. with 5 palmately arranged 
leaflets and coarse sharp spines; called just "blackberry" by Tom 
Brown. 
The black and red "chokeberry" that Leo Landy mentioned 
as producing very little fruit this year due to the drought are 
apparently Pyrus melanocarpa and Pyrus arbutifolia, according to 
"chokeberry" 
in the Peterson field guide series volume on 
edibles.

TX01: We visited Bill Wasiowich's G-Woodmansie; 27GT house this 
morning around 9:00, arriving in time to find him working on his 
pick-up truck 
in preparation for the day's outing. 
Joseph 
Czarnecki, the project photographer, and I had been invited at 
the end of our visit several days ago to return with him on a 
pineballing and moss gathering excursion. 
He had taken off a 
fire that was incredibly bald, an eight ply tire that was through 
at least three plies and had no tread on 
it whatsoever. 
He was 
worried about the rim of one of his other tires and was checking 
his equipment before going out onto the highway. 
While he was 
working on the truck and getting some other things ready, Joe and 
I explored around his yard, and up on the railroad tracks that 
run right in front of his place. I have drawn a little sketch map 
showing the arrangement of his house and the shed that he's built 
out of railroad ties that is about 100 ft away from the house. 
We had noticed his carvings before. He turns the wood on a lathe 
and then cuts designs on them that have a rather Ukrainian feel 
to them, though Bill disclaims any knowledge of any intent to 
make them look Ukrainian, he 
is of Ukrainian ancestry on his 
mother's side. 
The one set that looked vaguely like giant 
chessmen is perched up on a high platform in front of his porch, 
and I had been puzzled the Sunday before as to why he had set it 
there. 
It turns out that it 
is perched on top of a birdfeeder. 
I asked him about that, he said, yeah, he feeds the birds, but 
all 
he gets is mostly blue jays. 
There were certainly a lot of 
jays migrating past, through the yard during our visit. 
The 
feeder is set right under a red cedar, a good sized red cedar 
that may well have been planted there. 
Along the railroad there 
were scrub oaks and blackjack oaks and a few dwarf chestnut oaks. 
A black cherry 
in the front yard that he said was a wild cherry, 
and wasn't any good for producing fruit. It 
looked like genus (?) 
serrata. 
Joe and Bill talked at some length about old bottles, he 
showed us the rest of his collection and also showed a couple of 
catalogs, the latest being the fourth edition of Cobell's 
bottle price list, so 
it turned out that Bill had been trying to 
market the bottles but had given up 
in disgust because the 
dealers had been unwilling to give the prices shown in the book, 
Hunn--83 Fieldnotes 
page 22 
though Joe said he could make a good profit at the right flea 
market. 
The inside of Bill's house is rather dark and austere. 
His 
dinner consisted of a bottle of pickles and a few other odds and 
ends on the table. But he does have a number of books on the 
shelf, including the Nuremburg Trials, so no doubt he does some 
reading. 
He said the best place to get pine cones 
is 
in a 
pulpwood cutting area, near the west plain. I'm still not clear 
as to whether this 
is because the pulpwood operation has cut down 
the trees, and therefore the cones are readily picked up off of 
the loose branches left over from the cutting operation, or 
whether the pulpwood operation is 
really working out in the 
plains where the trees are very short anyway, and the cutting has 
somehow improved the growth of cones. 
I asked him whether he 
preferred to pick the cones opened or closed, he said he hardly 
ever finds a cone opened. 
He doesn't recognize the distinction 
between pineballing and pineconing that Christine had mentioned 
to me the night before. 
He says he doesn't know what you call 
it 
when you go out picking cones. 
His truck is a Chevy, 3/4 ton, 
1966, 
brown, with the headlights wired off (?), but it still 
runs. 
His mother is Ukrainian, some of the family still 
lives 
in 
Trenton. 
His parents had split up when he was young. 
He goes 
near the Wells Mills area when he goes to pull moss. 
I'll 
describe the location of a place later. His truck handles 60 
bushels worth of wet moss quite well, with 16 inch tires, but the 
tires are worn and the rims bent. 
He used to make his own cider 
from apples, and this topic came up because he had a book on the 
table, the state agricultural handbook, describing how to make 
your own beer, wine, and juices. 
foodways. He brought up from 
the basement another one of his carvings. 
He says he makes them 
of oak. 
Again that Ukrainian style. 
A big red, nameless cat 
curled up under the table. 
Then we started up talking about 
picking wild huckleberries, and he said he collects them in big 
shipping cans that would hold, I believe he said, 20 pounds of 
berries, but that doesn't seem like very many. 
He got $8 a can 
three years ago, and hasn't done much of that recently. 
Says 
there's some around Haines' place, because there's some big wet 
swamps in the area that inhibit frost. 
Presently there aren't 
any of these wild huckleberries worth picking as a result of 
frost, except the so—called swamp huckleberries. 
He says the 
price is the same as for commercial blueberries, and they are 
used mostly for juice. 
Wild hucks are selling for $1/pint in the 
stores this year, but if we need more info, ask a grower. 
Wild 
hucks taste better. 
He doesn't like spraying, and wild hucks are 
popular for this reason, he supposes. 
He lost his appetite for 
bluberries after seeing all 
the spraying that went on there when 
he worked there. 
He said it doesn't bother him to eat them, as 
long as he hasn't seen what they do to them. 
Apparently the 
blueberry growers tried to discourage people from buying 
huckleberries, saying that they were full of worms, etc. 
Hunn--83 Fieldnotes 
page 23 
Presumably they didn't like the competition. 
Bill described a variety of wild hucks he called a pill 
berry. 
He says it's real sweet but it has lots of seeds, and it 
grows 
in the woods. 
As he drove down the road I rode with Bill 
in his truck, and the noise of the truck all 
but drowned out his 
speech. 
We headed east on highway 72 from the railroad bridge at 
the turnoff to his house, and soon came to the east plains area 
and turned into the coil airfield to do some pine cone picking. 
The scrub oaks (blackjack oaks) there he just called them scrub 
oaks, which are the same as regular oaks 
in his opinion. 
He 
apparently was doing this more or less to humor us, because he 
didn't seem to intend to do much picking, but was more interested 
in pulling more moss. Raining spoils it because your gloves get 
wet (worn for picking) . We turned off to the north at coil 
airfield and soon came to an area, a nice productive area, one 
with lots of cones. 
He said that's the name of the game, finding 
a good area. 
He grabbed his metal washtub which he slings over 
his shoulder on a canvas strap, both for pine cone and moss 
pulling operations. For moss pulling he just dumps it from the 
washtub into the wheelbarrow and then into the truck. 
In pine 
cone picking he carries it around with him from one tree to 
another. 
He works very quickly, using both hands. The pitch 
pines are about six to eight feet tall 
at the maximum. 
He took 
both closed and open cones, both this year's and last year's. The 
latter, he says, are gray. 
Later he described a third year cone, 
all 
gray, 
in distinction from more recent cones which have some 
brown on them, where they are folded over against the trunk, and 
the third year cones are no good because they get full 
of worms 
holes so when they're heated they fall apart. 
They're still 
closed, even though they're three years old. 
He says it used to 
be they'd only take this year's cones, but now they'll take 
last 
year's cones because there aren't as many people out pineconing 
as there used to be, and therefore the buyers can't be as 
particular. 
You could tell someone else had been at this spot already 
not too long ago. 
We suspected they'd only stopped briefly to 
check 
it and then went on. 
I presume he noticed the few broken 
stems of the cones near the edge of the grove and much denser 
concentration of cones a IittIe bit inside. 
He thinks there are 
quite a few still picking cones. 
The area with a concentration 
of 
larger cones 
is the most desirable. 
Areas with small, 
scattered cones are not worth the trouble. 
Large cones are about 
three inches long. 
Don't come much longer. They grow in amongst 
the blackjack oak and pitch pine where some, what he identified 
as rhododendron, not sure what .species, shrubby bushes about three 
feet tall. 
He has sold these trees to a neighbor lady 
apparently, and also the longer limbs of the rhododendron. 
$8 
for pinkish white in the spring. 
He says that Allyn doesn't buy 
rhododendron very much anymore. 
He fills up twice as fast where 
the cones are real thick, and of good size. 
Allyn of Whiting 
gets most of the pine cones. 
At least fifty people were picking 
Hunn--83 Fieldnotes 
page 24 
around twelve years ago 
in Chatsworth, though many of those were 
drunks and bums that used to pick enough so they could get a 
drink. 
Most of these drunks and bums, he says, have moved up 
towards Brown's Mills now, to do their picking, so he doesn't see 
them much anymore. 
Moss pulling 
is not as popular with the 
drunks and bums because it requires more of a set up and a place 
where you can dry out the moss, and the turn around's not as 
quick. 
He found a cone with a worm hole and he said the cone would 
fall apart if heated up. 
Saw sugar hucks growing, don't know 
what it 
is exactly, no berries there. Saw some third year cones; 
he said "They're done," the same phrase he used to describe his 
old buddy Fred Brown, who's done "Long done," he said. 
In other 
words, he died some years ago. 
The Warren Grove cones are of higher quality, not so ragged 
as those on the East Plain. Ragged refers to smallness of cones, 
and cones with wormholes in them. 
Pineconing is preferred by 
drunks and bums because you can just sell them and go straight to 
the bar. 
Picking cones makes them come back better, Bill said. 
Without picking, cones get ragged, wormy and small. 
It also 
seems like moss comes back better where people have 
been picking 
it. 
He's not so sure the same principal applies with hunting, as 
I suggested it might. 
Some areas, such as the one we were 
passing through, and we're now driving down the highway further 
east were to brushy and hard to get around in, and he doesn't 
like to pink 
in areas of that sort. 
I asked him about getting 
lost 
in the Pines when out picking cones and he said, yeah it can 
happen on a cloudy day or at high noon, because you can't see 
your shadow, and it's really not very pleasant to be 
lost in a 
swamp with a heavy bagload, so 
it's hard to get your bearings. 
He goes by his shadow and the wind direction, on a windy day, to 
keep his orientation. 
Warren Grove 
is the best place because of the pulping 
operation. 
The east plains are better because it's easier to get 
around in that area. 
Last year a lady from the Inquirer had come 
out to take pictures of him pineconing last year, but never sent 
a copy of the article to him. 
He talked about another place 
called Spring Hill where there had been a forest fire, some cones 
there but not that many. Mostly the west and east plains are 
where to go. 
We then turned onto New Jersey Highway 532 to the north, the 
left hand turn (toward Joe Albert's and Cliff Frazee's tree 
farm). 
We proceeded for a few miles on 532, to be described in 
more detail 
later. 
He talked about the Forked River Mountains, 
where there are supposedly some short pines worth picking. 
He 
went up there, having heard about this, but didn't see any, 
though he gets sugar huckleberries there. 
They grow to about 1 
1/2 to 2 feet high, real short. 
Pick 
in July, from first or 
second week, through August. 
They have to be dead right he says, 
Hunn--83 Fieldnotes 
page 25 
or they're not worth anything. 
Some you can pick right into 
September, but it's mostly July and August. 
A good man who's 
willing to work can make a good hundred dollars a day 
in 
blueberry and wild huckleberry season. 
Moss, 50-75 dollars a 
day. 
His maximum was 200 bushels in one.day, which was (?) 
(sounds like $7200!? Must be $200) 
He's heard people are cutting 
birch limbs now, and some claim to have made $150 in a day, but 
he's not sure about that. 
Sugar huck brush, which he also 
collects in the winter time after the leaves have fallen, brings 
in about $30 a day. 
Moss is the steadiest activity. He knows 
where to go. 
It's not the same with birch. He can waste a lot of 
time looking for birch. 
Bill heard that Allyn had told a newspaper that he bought 
from a 150 pineconers, but he doesn't know of that many himself, 
perhaps a 150 if you count the whole region. 
He identified a 
post oak as a white oak. 
Bill plans to work here at the stake. 
We came to the place he had been working before and he backed the 
truck onto an old track that had been made by cedar cutters. 
He 
planned to work until dark, but I had to go back and catch a 
plane. 
We 
identified some plants in this bog. 
There was a nice 
stand of white cedar and sphagnum moss, and he laid some wood 
planks onto the ground, and pulled his wheelbarrow, bucket and 
pitchfork out of the truck, and he headed out along his plank 
road into the bog to the place where he'd left off working 
previously, about 50 feet into the bog. 
We found some myrica, 
some bayberry. 
He says it's good for making tea out of the 
leaves, attributing this to the old timers. 
There was some 
eriophorum growing, he said he thought it was cotton something, 
maybe cotton grass, said they sell them to make flower 
arrangements. 
That's in fact the case, because I saw some at the 
Landies a few days before (called cat's paw by them) 
Saw some 
cranberry plants with some very large fruits which I collected 
(vaccinium macrocarpon). 
He said, that's the wild cranberry, not 
worth picking, but it's edible. 
I asked about another shrub, an 
evergreen, and he replied, "That's a good question. 
I wish I 
knew." 
He doesn't seem to be curious to know about the names of 
things. 
He said, "yeah that's white cedar. 
There are white 
cedars and reds, and white oaks and reds, but the red oaks grow 
elsewhere, he said. 
This bog was located just off of highway 532, 
it's the road 
to Waretown. 
Beginning at 25.2 on the odometer it measured 26.7 
to the Brookville campground turnoff. 
28.0 at the future home of 
Albert Music Hall sign. 
28.9 at the junction of highway 72, 
so 
we were two and 7 tenths miles down highway 532 and from there 
it 
was 2.3 miles to the whiting junction, highway 539 heading west, 
and another 6.9 miles to the railroad crossing where we turned 
into Bill's place and drove 1.7 miles to his house. 
Another 
plant that we had collected back 
in the west plains was 
arctostaphylos uva ursi, kinnick kinnick (bearberry). I asked 
Bill 
the name and he didn't know, but thought it began with a k. 
I suggested kinnick kinnick and he thought it was right. 
Says 
Hunn--83 Fieldnotes 
page 26 
the old timers used 
it for tea, as he had said on several 
occasions. 
The distance from Bill's house to the swamp where he 
was pulling moss was 14.5 miles. 
He says he doesn't care that there are fewer people picking 
now than before. 
I thought he might be happy to have less 
competition, but he almost seems to miss them, and perhaps it's 
because they made the picking more productive. 
Bill said 
in the 
future feel free to come by, early in the a.m. or p.m. 
It was a very interesting conversation. 
You can see just 
how rational Bill 
is 
as he proceeds to decide what to harvest. 
He's a very hard working guy. 
He gets out there and puts 
in a 
full day's work most of the week. 
In his off—hand way, critical 
of those who just work at 
it piecemeal, the bums and drunks. 
At 
Bill's house that morning I finished my second roll of film and 
started my third. (color slides). 
This concludes my notes for my October 11 trip with Joe 
Czarnecki and Bill Wasiowich. (plant), (animal)

I am to meet Howard Boyd at 7 A.M. at jet Rtes 
206 and 30 at MacDonalds. 
I may meet Betty at 4:45 A.M. at her 
plane for owling. 
She says she has Great Horned Owls and 
sometimes Screech. 
Her home phone number is 609-983-3329 and her 
home 
is 
in G—Medford Lakes; 17GT off Tuckerton Rd. 1 mile southeast 
of Camp Lenape, Boy Scouts. 
I found the building at the forest headquarters in 
good shape but with the front door unlocked. 
Howard Spendelow is the compiler of the Pinelands CBC (609-
983-06855) while Betty 
is the founder and organizer. 
According 
to Betty the count was started about 12-13 years ago and named 
Pinelands over the protests of National Audubon Society editors 
who prescribe a CBC name based on some prominent town or feature 
within the circle. 
She successfully insisted, however. 
My 
contact person for the CBC was Miss Lois Morris, the aunt of 
Leslie Morris, a graduate student in Anthropology at the Univ. of 
Washington who was my TA this past quarter. 
Lois Morris is an 
avid birder who has lived 
in this area for 7 years (she thus 
defers to Betty Woodford). 
Lois's phone is 201-350-0911 and her 
address 
is Box 173, G—Whiting; 52GT, NJ 08759. 
She will be glad to 
talk to me and to refer me to other relevant parties. 
I also called Ed Hazelton, the sneakbox bird gunner from 
G—Manahawkin; 56GT to see about photographing him in action. 
He 
was very willing but said he hadn't been gunnin' all 
year since 
the wildlife refuge people took away his pond. 
They took his 
pond away last year also, but replaced it. 
This year they took 
away the replacement pond with no option, however he says they 
have promised to fix him up for next year. 
We agreed to put him 
in touch with Dennis McDonald, 
local photographer (609-871-

in case something comes 
up

TXO1: Today I participated in the Pinelands Christmas Bird Count 
(CBC). 
I was to meet Betty Woodford, count organizer, at 4:45 
A.M. at her back gate for owling but arrived 10 minutes late and 
couldn't find her drive (as we had prepared for this contingency 
the night before she was not inconvenienced). 
So I went owling 
by myself driving south from Medford to G-Atsion; 23GT on a back 
road, then exploring a short stretch of the Quaker Bridge Rd. and 
Hammond Rd. from U3206 at Atsion. 
Beautifully clear moon and 
cold (about 20 degrees F); heard a pair of Great Horned Owls. 
Then proceeded at dawn to jct of US206 & 30 where I met Howard 
Spendelow, count compiler and group leader and a Jim Stasz, an 
expert younger birding enthusiast from Audubon (!), NJ. 
We 
covered our area, the SW segment of the CBC circle (a 15 mile 
diameter circle with a center 1.5 m east of the jct of US206 and 
rte 541. 
The area included considerable relatively wild 
pinelands & cranberry bog plus orchards, fields, suburban housing 
developments about small ponds, etc. 
This variety of 
microhabitats was productive of 61 species (of 83 total, a 
record, recorded in the circle by the 20-30 observers). 
Howard 
Spendelow has compiled (i.e., collected the bird species lists 
and total 
individuals counted of each from each group 
representative, added them up, gathered other needed statistics, 
and submitted the forms to National Audubon Society for 
subsequent publication in American Birds, a journal published by 
NAS summarizing bird sightings nationwide) the Pinelands CBC 
since about 1976 when he took over that duty from Jim Woodford, 
who founded the count in 
1968. 
Howard provided me with a neat 
typed summary of the count results from 1968-1982. 
He 
is a 
knowledgeable if 
lowkey birder who retired to a rural homesite 
with 4 acres on Braddocks Mill Lake, Marlton (609-983-0685). 
He 
is a bird-bander also, trapping and banding small birds attracted 
to feeders 
in his yard. 
The US Fish & Wildlife Service licenses 
his banding operation, one of eight such 
in south Jersey 
(according to Jim Stasz, who with Betty Woodford are the second 
and third of that number). 
Their banding efforts are not 
carefully planned research projects, but activities each pursues 
for enjoyment. 
Jim and Howard discussed banding issues, such as 
return rates and longevity of birds. Howard has captured a junco 
that was banded 10 years before. 
Bird banders share a fund of 
Hunn--83 Fieldnotes 
page 23 
common vocabulary and a perspective on bird identification based 
on 
in-hand features. 
Howard's son, Peter Spendelow, 
is a 
graduate student in biology at the University of Washington, 
seattIe. 
Jim Stasz, 179 Edgewood Ave., Audubon, NJ, 609-547-1749, 
is 
a professional botanist/ecologist who recently completed a year-
long research project surveying a tract in southern Maryland for 
the Nature Conservancy. 
He claimed that he and his father, 
Clarence Stasz, now dead, are the most knowledgeable experts on 
Pine Barrens birds, 
largely by default, as few birders or 
ornithologists have devoted much attention to Pine Barrens birds 
He was born in Audubon, NJ, 
in 
1948, and grew up birding, 
herping, and plant watching within a 100 mile radius of his home, 
spending many long weekends with his father exploring every 
corner of the Pine Barrens. 
Neither he nor his father kept 
careful written notes of their observations. 
I made an 
appointment to interview him at his home at 2 P.M. on the 19th of 
December (see PFP83-FEH1219 and AEHO05-006). 
Clearly, he 
is a 
top-flight birder, as well as all-round naturalist, with a strong 
attachment to South Jersey, his home place. 
We arrived for the potluck dinner/compilation party at Betty 
Woodford's about 6 P.M. 
Betty was little in evidence, as she was 
tending her pet deer, which was on the "critical 
list" due to an 
overdose of tranquilizer (it had gotten loose and had had to be 
recaptured?). 
Howard Spendelow proceeded to compile records, our 
rarities and others were whispered about in the usual CBC post-
mortem style (half the fun of the count is comparing notes 
afterwards and magnifying the significance of one's 
accomplishments). 
At the compilation I introduced myself to Carl 
Anderson, director of the Rancocas Nature Center, a person I had 
been advised to contact. 
He has a wry sense of humor, a graying 
beard, and a laid-bank attitude. 
We had a pleasant discussion of 
my plans in regards to talking to 
local natural history buffs and 
setting up an herbarium collection. 
On the latter, he suggested 
I contact Dr. Alfred "Ernie" Schuyler, director of the 
Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences, where much of Whitford 
Stone's original collections are housed. 
The Chrysler Herbarium 
at Rutgers was his second choice. 
Carl works as a volunteer once 
a week (Mondays, when the Rancocas center is closed) at the 
Philadelphia Academy herbarium. 
Carl also recommended I contact 
Ted Gordon (Rose Mill Rd., Vincentown, 859-3566), a botanist and 
local historian. 
Jim Stasz recommended contacting Lou Hand, old 
hand, most knowledgeable of all on Pine Barrens botany, and 
Eugene Vivian (at Whitesbog Environmental Center). 
I then met Betty Woodford. 
I requested an 
interview and 
tour of her "Cedar Run Nature Preserve," set for 10 A.M. 
Wednesday, December 21. 
She expressed interest in my Pineland 
Interpretive Ethnobiology idea. 
She then volunteered an 
explanation of the reservations she and some of her friends have 
about the PFP, as per presentations she has heard: basically, she 
is upset that PFP researchers are failing to distinguish between 
Hunn--83 Fieldnotes 
page 30 
traditions "that will 
last" and those she judges are ephemeral, 
and thus inconsequential. 
P.M. and crashed early.

TX01: First stop was the Pinelands Commission Office at G-New 
Lisbon; 21GT. 
I checked in with Bobby Zampella, Commission 
biologist, about 9 A.M. 
I asked about herbarium arrangements and 
collecting permits: he suggested I contact Dr. David 
Fairbrothers, director of the Chrysler Herbarium at Rutgers (609-
932-2843), saying that he had a strong interest in the Pine 
Barrens and has published some on the subject. 
I contacted Dr. 
Fairbrothers and he readily agreed to curate our specimens, 
lend 
plant presses, and identify plants we can't figure out. 
As he 
planned to be on leave 
in the winter, he advised contacting 
Janice Meyer, an assistant, c/o the Nelson Biological 
Laboratories at Rutgers if he were unavailable. 
Both he and Zampella advised that a state permit was 
required to collect on state lands--though land owners permission 
was adequate on private lands, 
if endangered, etc., species not 
involved. 
Contact Chris Bethmann, Superintendent, Lebanon State 
Forest, New Lisbon 08064, for permit application. 
I tried, but 
he 
is on vacation until January: contact by mail after holidays. 
(Eugene Vivian thought it might not be necessary, however.) 
Zampella introduced me to Barry Brady, archaeologist and 
Commission Cultural Resources person, who is to be my contact 
person at the Commission. 
Brady showed me to a phone 
in his 
office I may use and introduced me to Lisa Rosenberger, 
Commission economist (Brady & Rosenberger are the only two social 
scientists on the staff), his office mate. 
Brady also suggested 
I contact Ted Gordon (Burrs Mill Rd., Vincentown, 859-3566): 
"unmatched knowledge of biological and cultural 
info on plants; a 
local high school teacher"). 
He also suggested we might look at the native wine industry 
centered at Egg Harbor area, 
in particularly the Renault Winery, 
which is on the historic sites list. 
The wine, however, 
is 
terrible, "very foxy," as they say of New York wine, probably due 
to soils, etc. 
Also recommended for botanical history: Mary 
Treat, who has written many articles in Home & Garden (?) and a 
Gilbert Cavalier, old time naturalist. 
I then called Jack Richardson (not in, 
call back later 
Hunn--83 Fieldnotes 
page 32 
today), Dennis McDonald, the 
local photog (meet this P.M. at 
Moorestown to give him film--done, will be 
in touch if photo 
sessions can be arranged); Hazel Landy (Leo now working on grave 
blankets, come by at 3 
P.M. to 
look at birds, etc.--missed it 
today, will go tomorrow); Helen & George Zimmer and Ted Gordon 
did not answer. 
Dick Regensburg was in the Commission office 
that A.M. for a conference, but I did not meet him, though Brady 
gave me his address & phone number. 
Departed at 10:30 A.M. 
TX02: Stopped at the G—Whitesbog; 21GT Conservation and 
Environmental Science Center east of Browns Mills about 11 A.M. 
Sign on headquarters door: Conservation & Environmental Studies 
Center, Inc. has been designated a National Environmental 
Education Landmark; This site possesses distinctive values in 
revealing significant natural and cultural processes through 
effective environmental education programs; 1972; National Park 
Service; United States Department of the Interior. 
I found my 
way 
in to 
inquire as to their set up only to find myself 
immediately ushered into the director's office, Eugene Vivian 
himself. 
We had an enjoyable, affable one hour talk. 
I 
explained my 
interest in putting together an 
interpretive volume 
on plants, animals, and people in the Pine Barrens, which he 
thought a good idea. 
He mentioned a Rita Moonsammy, Arts Council 
representative, and a meeting he had had with her and the 
PINELANDS INTERPRETIVE COMMITTEE, a group convened last spring to 
develop a catalog of 
interpretive materials on Pine Barrens 
natural history: what educational materials are available and 
where they are, 
is the task. (Seems our project could fit in here 
very well.) 
Vivian explained his organization, CESC for short; 
he gave me a 1983 catalog of their available curricular 
materials, with those of interest to us marked: Conservation and 
Environmental Studies Center, Inc., Box 75596, RD 7, Browns 
Mills, NJ 08015, William D. Michalsky, Director, Dr. V. Eugene 
Vivian, Director Emeritus. Is self supporting on fees charged 
their clientele, mostly schools, youth groups, and some adult 
groups and private students. 
His effort is 
like that of Carl 
Anderson at Rancocas Nature Center, though Rancocas gets an 
Audubon Society subsidy; also like Betty Woodford's project, but 
more stress on longer term classes, as 
in his "Pine Barrens 
through the year" class. 
Vivian used to teach similar material 
at Glassboro State College. 
We discussed my 
interest in cultural ecology of such 
activities as moss pulling, pine cone harvesting, etc. 
He 
mentioned a Mr. Corliss of Tuckerton, now dead, who was one of 
the best "mossers": his son Shorty Corliss may be reached at 296-
2556. 
Another "mosser" 
is Jack Cervetto of Warren Grove (his 
house is on Rte 539 just east of 
luncheonette and Cervetto St., 
698-4293). 
I mentioned importance of Plains for pine cone 
collectors, and Vivian agreed that that's where he gets his also. 
He told story of Silas Little, old time silviculturalist, who 
hired some Pineys to bring him some pine cones for him to plant 
and study. 
Of course, they went straight to the Plains; which 
Hunn--83 Fieldnotes 
page 33 
led to Silas's discovery of the genetic distinctiveness of Plains 
dwarf pines! 
Vivian requested Leo Landy's phone number, as he 
is 
interested in his plant collecting activities. 
He identified the 
"sand grass" Landy collects as probably Ammophila breviligulata 
American Beach Grass. 
We discussed possible effects of pulling 
moss, etc.., on resource & ecology. 
He noted that Phragmites and 
cattail seem more common now than before, which he attributes to 
road building, etc., creating shallow empoundments, etc. 
He 
stresses positive effect of "turfing," stripping of moss, etc., 
cover down to bare sand, as 
in harvesting of moss layer 
to use 
to seal charcoal furnaces in old charcoaling operations, as well 
as 
in diking, etc., for cranberry bogs. 
This creates ideal 
environment for such rare plants as orchids, curly grass fern, 
pitcher plant, etc. 
He describes himself as something of a 
"crusader" for managed disturbance; notes that the Division of 
Fish and Gamer of the Department of Natural Resources seems to 
understand such "management" concept better that the Forest & 
Park people. 
Vivian reported having twice tried to get 
appointments to talk to the Allyn Manufacturing people but they 
put him off. 
He figures they don't want him to know how much 
stuff they're taking. 
He just looks over their fence, as they 
have no retail operation he could readily observe. 
He says they 
ship a lot of birch twigs now; he doesn't think it hurts the 
birch populations, however, as they replace their twigs. 
He 
notes that Lou Hand 
is 
living at Leisure -town; Silas Little, now 
retired in Moorestown on Creek Rd., 235-3615. 
TX03: On my way to headquarters to get film to take to Dennis 
McDonald in Moorestown, I drove in G—Mt. Misery; 27GT Rd., south 
from Rte 70 and found Freeman Taylor working in his front yard 
(0.7 mi 
south of route 70). 
He was friendly and invited me to 
come back to visit him anytime tomorrow. 
He expressed his 
concern for the apparent decline of the 
local deer population, 
attributing it to the legal doe hunting and to illegal "jacking." 
He now keeps only one rattlesnake, as 
it's illegal. 
He says his 
sister (?) knows local plants better than he does. 
Also 
mentioned a Ms. Pittman (?), now dead a few years, who knew all 
the plants. 
TX04: Proceeded to Moorestown, gave McDonald 20 rolls of each of 
the three types of film and all 30 36x mailers from Carl. 
He 
reported having just talked to Carl about it. 
I told him about 
Ed Hazelton conversation and gave him Ed's phone number. 
I said 
I'd call tomorrow if I could arrange something with Tom Brown the 
trapper or with Leo Landy (that won't work as according to Hazel 
in 4:30 P.M. phone call Leo just used spruce boughs collected 
near their house for the grave blankets). 
I then dashed over to 
Jim Stasz's house in Audubon for our scheduled interview. 
Noted 
his native weed & pine barrens garden out front of his house with 
the native prickly pear and yucca. 
I taped two hours of his 
reminiscences on Pine Barrens natural history, etc. (for which 
see PFP83—AEHO05-006). 
We agreed to consider a field trip 
together in March orJune (especially) as he averred he could talk 
Hunn--83 Fieldnotes 
page 34 
on this subject for many hours more, even better if 
in context of 
a field excursion. 
He also noted his photographic abilities; he 
might be a good source for natural history illustrative 
materials. 
Stayed so 
long at Stasz's that I had to call Hazel Landy to 
put off my visit to them until tomorrow; she said OK, at 3P.M. 
Returned to office after some shopping and rush hour traffic by 6 
P.M.

TX01: From 7 to 10 A.M. I explored Island Beach and vicinity for 
plants and birds, etc. 
Very cold and windy. 
En route to New 
Lisbon I stopped at Freeman Taylor's house for a visit. 
For 
details consult PFP83—AEH007 G—Mt. Misery; 27GT. 
Took photos of 
him holding his timber rattler and feeding birds at his feeders. 
Also pictures of his hounds, both fox and rabbit (small & short 
legged). 
He seems very pleased for the company and had no 
hesitation about cameras or tape recorders. 
He's a life—time 
local 
resident who loves to have animals, wild and barnyard type 
all 
around him "for company." 
He used to run fox hounds and 
talked a bit about it after I had turned off the tape 
(unfortunately). 
He said a dog that can only run for 3-4 hours 
isn't "a dog at all." 
They should be able to run a fox from 6 
A.M. till 6 P.M. and be getting stronger. 
They never let the 
dogs catch the fox. 
Put pipes around for the fox to shelter in. 
Doesn't do 
it anymore; says it's no fun to go along and listen to 
someone else's hounds. 
He knows some people, however, who still 
run foxes. 
He also talked a bit of wild fruit picking; he prefers them 
to the grown varieties in some cases; they taste better, he says. 
Examples include "dewberry," a trailing plant, probably Rubus 
hispidus, "bilberry," a tall, swamp plant with largish seeds, 
apparently Gaylussacia, and "sugarberry" or "sugar huck," a low 
bush of uplands with no or small seeds, probably Vaccinium sp.. 
He then listed a number of domestic cranberry and blueberry 
varieties, many of which he attributed to Mrs. White (of 
"whitesbog"): one of her boys now runs the operation, Tommy 
Darlington (?). 
Cranberry varieties he cited include "Jersies," 
"champions," "Hows (SPELLING?)," now preferred because the don't 
rot so easy, "blacks," which mature early, 
in September, and a 
blue cranberry. 
Obviously, there's more to be pursued with 
Freeman on this issue. 
I was at Freeman's from 10:30 until after 12:00 noon; I then 
dashed over to the Pinelands Commission office and made a few 
calls; set up a Thursday morning session with Tom Brown, the 
trapper, and Dennis McDonald, the photographer. 
According to 
Hunn--83 Fieldnotes 
page 36 
Muriel Brown, Tom is depressed about success of anti—trapping 
legislation in state and about his health, but does have a few 
traps out near the house (for fox?) we can check after sharing 
breakfast Thursday A.M. 
TX03: Then to Al Martis's to meet Lois Morris of Whiting for 
lunch. 
She is now retired; was warden (?) of a (the?) New Jersey 
women's prison. 
Now retired at G—Crestwood; 52GT, the huge (pop 
12000) development on Mike Kochs's land. 
Not bad for a local 
chicken farmer, though he's made enemies as a result. 
Lois 
thought we might want to get his opinions, but not to use her 
name. 
Lois is avid birder and naturalist now; started the 
"Crestwood strolls," informal very local nature walks now 
extremely popular in Crestwood (with up to 100 in attendance). 
Seems a great demand for this type of 
interpretation. 
She noted 
the "territoriality, jealously" among pine barrens "experts." 
Tries to steer clear of 
it. 
She 
is not opposed to trapping if 
done conscientiously (I had spoken of my 
interview with Tom 
Brown, the trapper), but was concerned that it 
is difficult to 
control those who are not conscientious in checking their traps 
frequently, etc. 
She says we might look up a Chester Hurley, a 
trapper friend of hers who traps in Manchester Twp. 
Hurley 
is 
angry about the Crestwood development spoiling his trapping area. 
Bud Hopkins is another G—Whiting; 52GT contact, a naturalist type 
also I think. 
She has participated in the Lakehurst CBC for the 
last 7 years, doesn't know when it was started or by whom. 
Her 
contact person is one of the compilers, Morton Cooper, who she 
describes as "Mr. Environmentalist" of Ocean Co. 
Also important 
locally 
is Maurice Chaillet of Tom's River, a past president of 
New Jersey Audubon. 
She notes having heard that a Dr. Albert 
Liszt has a book in the works of Pinelands plants, mosses on up, 
to be published in February (but probably not) by Johns Hopkins 
U. Press. 
Liszt teaches at Drexel Institute in Philadelphia. 
Lois looks forward to our proposed "Pinelands Ethnobiology" 
volume. 
She also recommended a wild flower guide by Newcomb as 
having more of Pine Barrens flora than the Peterson guide. 
Lou 
Hand a good contact; he knows Batsto very well; also we should 
talk to Annie Carter soon, 
if we can, as she 
is very ill. 
She 
also noted a "snake survey" of Berkeley Twp. conducted by a Bob 
Zapalorti, of a Staten Island, Herpetological Association. 
Zapalorti was hired by Ocean county to do the survey to help 
evaluate a proposed "Holiday City" development by Junior Dawes, 
local builder, wishing to expand. 
The county stopped it 
(temporarily?) on the strength (partly?) of the "snake survey." 
Strong feelings locally on that one. 
Ocean County apparently a 
stronghold of pine and corn snakes. 
Lois Morris is fairly new 
here but very helpful and interested (phone is 201-350-0911, 
address is Box 173, Whiting, NJ 08759). 
TX04: I then dashed to G—Nesco; 12GT to keep a 3 P.M. appt. with 
Leo and Hazel Landy (arriving at 3:30 after a long detour around 
a washed out bridge between Tuckerton and Batsto). 
Hazel was 
entertaining visitors from Maine, so Leo and I admired the birds 
Hunn--83 Fieldnotes 
page 37 
at their feeding station and talked about his business, etc., 
with his colorful commentary on world politics, etc., 
unfortunately not tape recorded (or fortunately, perhaps!). 
Attending their feeding station (stocked sparingly with sunflower 
seeds, to prevent the birds from becoming like welfare types, but 
mostly pine seeds, etc.) were about 10 titmice (also nest locally 
he reports), 6 chickadees (these little guys are very tough in 
the coldest weather), 15 "snowbirds" (=juncos, but he didn't 
recognize the "official" name), 5 doves (quiet, they just slip 
in, 
aptly named), 10 (white—throated) sparrows (sparrows are the 
working men of the bird world, scratching hard all 
the time; 
lots 
of different kinds, some with bright head stripes, etc., but 
types not named), 4 cardinals (lazy birds, they won't scratch, 
rather stand around as 
if they expect the sparrows to scratch for 
them!), and 4 blue jays (they just pick out the sunflower seeds, 
then fly off and wait for him to put out more; aggressive, but the 
mockingbird will send them off). 
On pine cones: Leo said he'd got some Piney collecting cones 
for him for next years stock. 
He pays the collector $7 per 
thousand (a bushel as measured by a basket he has) which he then 
sells, after heating to open them, for $20 per 1000. 
He told the 
piney he only wanted new ones, not those "old enough to vote," 
which he says are recognized by their overall gray color: they 
fall apart when heated, are no good. 
He thought the collectors 
tend to exaggerate the amounts collected (he wanted 9000, got 
about 7000 by his estimation). 
He says, "they don't lie, 
the 
just exaggerate!" 
He says the Piney was working only because he 
needed the cash for Christmas. 
Leo thought that Jack Richardson 
"didn't do anything" with his cones, just buys them up and 
resells them (to Allyn?). 
Allyns he thought heated them to open 
them. 
He doesn't have anything to do with Allyns. 
They once 
wanted to buy some stuff from him but they wouldn't agree to his 
price, so he says "the heck with them." 
He doesn't like they way 
they paint things up, which he doesn't like to do. 
On grave blankets and pillows. 
He doesn't like to make them 
much but has orders for three or four due by the weekend. 
He 
will make them, but not on any guaranteed schedule (thus hard for 
me to schedule a photography session to document the process). 
He had shipped out the last of those he made the day before. 
He 
did have three "pillows" which he had made for Muriel who put 
them on the graves of their three dogs which died suddenly (and 
perhaps two by poisoning, the third was dying of cancer anyway). 
I photographed the dog's graves with grave pillows in place and 
Leo holding one up to show how he uses a two—by—four about a foot 
long covered with sphagnum moss (in lieu of the styrofoam 
employed in more commercial operations) as a backing to hold 
it 
together. 
It 
is basically an 18 
inch diameter or so circle of 
spruce boughs (collected locally) with a spray of plastic flowers 
in the 
center, featuring poinsettias. 
A "grave blanket" 
is 
simply a larger (about 2 foot by 3) rectangular version of this, 
also backed the same way. 
I photographed several 
in a cemetery 
Hunn--83 Fieldnotes 
page 38 
along the road at the county line just west of Batsto late that 
afternoon in failing light. 
He also showed me some scotch broom 
branches he had spray painted silver to use on a grave blanket 
with the plastic flowers. 
He says each customer specifies their 
own requirements in design of grave blankets. 
He charges $8, 
take 
it or leave it. 
He says most of those you see for sale 
in 
stands, etc., are very poorly done, will fall apart. 
I asked about "sand grass" as I had collected some Ammophila 
sp. that AM at Island Beach. 
He showed me his collections, which 
certainly look like Ammophila and described how they grow, with 
sand blowing around the base of their stems. 
Instead of being 
choked as other grasses would be they just keep on growing as the 
sand piles up. 
He claims that if you dig down to the roots you 
might go down 2.0 feet to where the plant was growing when 
it 
first got started. 
He complained again of those (unnamed) who 
denied him access to a collecting area (for "sand grass" and 
"bayberry"); this may have been on "golden nugget casino" 
property? 
He said they then turned around and bulldozed all 
the 
sand grass, etc., 
into a big pile and burned in a big 
development. 
He noted that the sample I had just collected would 
fall apart (he was right) because I had picked it too late. 
Leo seemed very affable this afternoon and welcomed me to 
return on my next trip. 
I purchased a 12 inch grape vine wreath, 
just like the smaller grapevine basket bases, for $3. 
He said he 
planned to go cut some firewood to feed his stoves soon. 
He and 
Hazel seemed well and were swapping amusing anecdotes, stories, 
and opinions with their friends, a couple of their age who had 
retired in Maine and were back 
in town visiting. 
Next time I 
visit I want to have some prints for them of this and earlier 
photo sessions. 
Visit lasted from 3:30 to 4:30. 
I then returned 
directly and spent the evening logging all 
this stuff. 
Over and 
out at 11:30 P.M.; 
it is 6 degrees above now and going down. 
Full moon and first day of winter.

TXO1: I spent the early A.M. photographing tree bark patterns and 
tree shapes to document what Freeman Taylor had told me yesterday 
about oak and pine identification in winter or by bark. 
I then 
attempted to call 
the Zimmers from the Pinelands office but 
without success. 
I did get a copy of a draft by David Glassboro 
of "Cultural Management and Interpretation" from Barry Brady. 
I 
then proceeded to Medford for my 10 A.M. appointment with 
Elizabeth "Betty" Woodford at G—Cedar Run: 17GT, her home wildlife 
sanctuary and rehabilitation center, located very near the 
historic site of Braddock's Mill. 
I planned to tape our 
discussion of the history of her involvement in Pine Barrens 
natural history interpretation and conservation as well as her 
views on the current situation, but found it more congenial to 
just chat as she guided me around the property. 
I did get some 
photos of her animals and her in action. 
"Cedar Run" is about 120 acres that she and her husband, 
Jim, purchased in 
1938. 
The property includes a 7 acre lake 
impounded behind a small earthen dam they constructed. 
It drains 
west into the Rancocas, but their property straddles the divide 
between than stream and the Mullica. 
They have a daughter and 
two sons. 
The daughter is "heir apparent" to her animal rehab 
operation as she has nursing training and is 
interested 
in 
carrying on the work (i.e., the daughter). 
This animal 
rehabilitation work 
is a major focus of her efforts. 
She houses 
a constant stream of sick and injured animals which she avoids 
holding, etc., to prevent their becoming imprinted on humans or 
unwary of same which are released to the wild upon their 
successful treatment. 
A few animals, such as a congenitally 
blind red fox and a deer abandoned in 
infancy and flightless 
hawks and owls, victims of local malice, which cannot be 
rehabilitated, will 
remain 
permanently. 
The animals are kept in 
large enclosures built by Jim and are regularly checked by state 
authorities in conjunction with permit renewals, etc. 
I observed 
two red foxes, four raccoons, about 6+ white—tailed deer, two 
red—tailed hawks, one rough—legged hawk, one kestrel, on barn 
owl, three great—horned owls, a screech owl, a pheasant, a 
pigeon, etc. 
The rehabilitation operation is supported by 
Hunn--83 Fieldnotes 
page 40 
donations of both money and volunteer labor, which she rewards by 
recognition in an annual newsletter/report called "Our Fur and 
Feathers Review" (copy of 1983 Review to ephemera file). 
She 
receives injured and sick animals from all 
over New Jersey and 
works in collaboration with two local veterinarians, who advise 
her on treatments and deal with hopeless cases. 
She 
is not 
overly sentimental about her effort, but is obviously strongly 
committed to 
it. 
She then took me on the nature trail walk around the lake, a 
mile long excursion over which she has 
led innumerable groups of 
school kids as well 
as adults. 
She said, "if anything I've done 
is worthwhile it 
is to have led some children to appreciate 
nature" (approximately). 
The walk has numbered points of natural 
interest and includes (indigenous) examples of both common and 
characteristic as well 
as rare and characteristic Pine Barrens 
plants, the latter represented by Corema conradii, pyxie moss, 
turkey beard, pitcher plants, orchids, etc. 
We saw examples of 
pitch, short—leaf, and white (introduced) pine; black, white, 
chestnut, blackjack, and bear oaks; sour gum; sweet bay; white 
cedar; and a great variety of characteristic shrubs. 
Very 
educational for me. 
At the conclusion of the visit she gave me a 
Pine Barrens plant list (of about 125 species, certainly not 
exhaustive, and sold me a copy of Witmer Stones "Plants of South 
Jersey," a 1972 reprinting for which she wrote the introduction, 
for $25, a real 
steal! 
I also observed her bird feeding 
operations and some of the ground traps she uses in her banding 
operations, not currently in action due to press of other work. 
Her office contains a large library of natura► history books and 
books on the Pine Barrens. 
I asked 
if she had taught 
professionally as she seemed concerned to describe her teaching 
techniques used with visiting children, such as making the nature 
trail fun and telling stories. 
She said, no, that she had never 
obtained a college education. 
She 
is nevertheless very well 
informed on such topics as botany, ornithology, veterinary 
practice, etc. 
She writes a column regularly for a local 
newspaper on a variety of topics related to her interests. We 
should get copies, 
if relevant. 
We discussed the definition of "Pine Barrens," and what 
constituted authentic "Pine Barrens folklife." 
This apparently a 
source of concern 
in regard to their view of the PFP effort. 
I 
explained that the PFP was concerned with the entire "Pinelands 
Reserve," and that the broader context was necessary to 
appreciate the nature of the Pine Barrens. 
She seemed to see the 
point, noting that Witmer Stone also found it 
impossible to 
confine his botanical investigations to the "Barrens," but ended 
up describing the entire south Jersey flora. 
While we were examining her recuperating fauna, a woman 
arrived who had read about the sanctuary in the newspaper. 
She 
just wanted to 
look around. 
Betty greeted her graciously and we 
went the rounds together. 
After the woman left Betty commented 
Hunn--83 Fieldnotes 
page 41 
that she had been surprised at how well spoken and dressed the 
woman was, as the note she had first received from her seemed to 
indicate a less well educated & appointed individual. 
Clearly, 
Betty has strong opinions as to proper conduct and standards, and 
is quick to judge people thereby. 
Nevertheless she is open to 
reconsidering her views on closer inspection.

I asked her if much had been written on the history of 
botanical research in the area. 
She said alas no, just on the

She described Lou Hand as very knowledgeable, 
though largely self taught as a botanist, now living at 
Leisuretown. 
She then confided as to a good location for finding 
curly grass fern (sterile fronds are evergreen), at MacDonald 
Branch in the Lebanon State Forest near where I'm staying. (I 
subsequently tried to find it but without success, I don't yet 
have the search pattern down!)

to support the sanctuary work. 
I asked

She said that she

Incidental observations: 
I described my visit of the day 
before to Freeman Taylor (she had advised seeing him) and we 
exchanged impressions; she said "he wouldn't kill a flea" 
(approximately), but cautioned about accepting his names for 
things as proper names. 
The Mr. Davis, bird expert, he had 
referred to she explained was a Mr. Pete Davis, and not really an 
expert; now resident in Santa Barbara, CA. 
With reference to a 
photograph in the Stone reprinted volume frontispiece; taken by 
Stone; she noted it could have been taken today; that is, 
certain 
areas of the Pines are just as they were at the turn of the 
century; some cause for satisfaction at their efforts. 
TX02: As 
it was then too late to try again to contact the Zimmers 
I decided to take the Landy plant collection over to Whitesbog 
for Dr. Eugene Vivian to 
look at, 
as he seemed interested in 
Landy's operation in our last conversation and I figured he might 
be able to

On my return from Medford I photographed a roadside stand 
selling plant materials, grave blankets and pillows, etc. 
The 
name of the stand was "Jersey Roots" located next to NJ's Piano 
and Organ Co., and 0.6 miles w of Old G—Red Lion; 23GT Rd., on SR70 
(north side). 
A young man was nearby splitting wood, but he was 
just working for the owner, a man named Don, according to the 
wood splitter, Don 
is from West Virginia ("Jersey Roots"! ?). 
However, I was unable to 
locate him and a closed sign was up. 
However, I did note one very nicely laid out wreath/grave pillow 
which used the following plants: black spruce boughs, sweet bay 
leaves, white pine cones, Eriophorum virginianum, narrow—leaved 
cattail, Thlaspi, holly with fruits, two grasses (Setaria? and 
Hordeum?), club moss with fruiting bodies, gold crest, and sea 
lavender. 
Also for sale there were cedar poles, reed, broadleaf 
cattail, Johnson grass (?), Setaria, birch logs, cedar bird 
houses, and grape wreaths, white pine boughs, squashes, and oak 
firewood. 
Another stand a half mile east advertised grave 
blankets and pillows, $5.95 and up.

TX01: Yesterday, Friday, March 16th, I arrived at Washington 
National Airport about 10 A.M., picked up the rental car, and 
drove to the Library of Congress where I discussed plans, etc., 
with Mary, Sue, Elaine, and Alan Jabbour. 
Talked with Joe 
Czarnecki by phone and arranged to meet him at George Campbell's 
house at 8 A.M. Saturday, the 17th. 
Packed the Kaypro, cameras, 
and tape recorder in the car and blasted off for South Jersey 
about 1 P.M. 
I drove the long way round after crossing the 
Delaware Memorial bridge to see some countryside I hadn't seen 
before. 
I took SR49 to Salem and then to Quinton, then northeast 
through Alloway and Shirley to Elmer, then through Willow Grove 
to Buena, then up SR54 to US30 and the new Hammonton Motor 
Hotel. 
Left the motel at 7:10 A. M. today and just beat Joe Cz. to 
the Campbell place by a minute or two at 8:05. 
They live at the 
end of Stipson I. 
Rd., about 2 miles south of G-Eldora; 34GT, just 
across the line 
in Cape May County from Cumberland County. 
George Campbell, Sr., and his youngest son (George, Jr.?) were on 
their back porch talking with a pheasant gunner who was about to 
go out after the birds. 
When they learned I hadn't brought boots 
they had a good laugh, but I was able to borrow one of the son's 
extra pairs. 
George, Sr., Joe, and I then drove around to where 
George was working to repair a dike protecting one of his salt 
haying fields. 
This one now on State land after the State 
purchased the land from the estate of the past owner (who 
apparently let George work it for hay?). 
Most of George's haying 
fields, however, are apparently his own property. The State 
is 
not likely to allow him to continue diking the land in future. 
As explained in 
the tape transcript (PFP84-AEH001), the diking is 
done with a 68,000 pound crane/bank hoe. 
Springtime being 
devoted to maintaining his some 15 miles of dike. 
The diking has 
only become necessary subsequent to the bad winter storm of 1950 
and because of an apparent rise in sea levels on the Delaware Bay 
shore (and worldwide?) of what George estimates is 
at least two 
feet. 
Jim Stasz confirms that, indeed, sea levels have risen 
(and/or lands have sunk) at least several 
inches since then, as 
one can find old colonial foundations of houses under several 
feet of water. 
Noteworthy is the relationship between the 
Hunn--84 Fieldnotes 
page 45 
sensitivity of high salt marsh species such as Spartina patens 
(yellow salt (hay) 
in George's terminology) to just a few inches 
difference in elevation, thus allowing someone who has worked 
with such marshlands for a generation or two to perceive long 
term ecological changes. 
George clearly described the zonation 
of salt marsh vegetation, with sedges lowest (just water beyond), 
then yellow salt (Spartina patens), the "rosemary" (Distichlis 
spicata), then "black grass" (Juncus girardi, a rush, according 
to pg 233 of Witmer Stone's The Plants of Southern New Jersey), 
then the taller, coarser variety of "yellow salt" at the edges 
(this may be Spartina glabra) and mixed with the widespread and 
invasive weed, Phragmites communis; then the "upland" vegetation 
of "elder brush" (id uncertain), etc. 
Note a major 
ethnoecological distinction in George's terms between "meadow" 
and "upland." 
He frequently contrasted the two, as 
in the 
contrast between "fresh hay" of the uplands and "salt hay" of the 
marshes. 
Though he didn't say so 
in so many words, he seems to 
identify himself as a "salt marsh person" in contrast to "upland 
people." 
He continues with this hard and "dirty" work not so 
much for the money--as he doesn't make that much--but because he 
enjoys it: being outdoors, doing a variety of tasks changing with 
the seasons, etc., yet he 
is clearly open to innovative money 
making occupations, as 
in his pheasant and crab "farming" 
operations and the campground he hopes to build on a piece of his 
river from property (if he can overcome the objections of 
environmentalists and/or rich and influential neighbors). 
I won't go 
into more detail as Jens has good stuff on 
George's operation(s) already and the tape transcript is 
detailed. 
But I was impressed by George's "conservation 
awareness," developed in spite of objections to "extreme" 
protectionism (exemplified by his commentary on the 
environmentalist who testified about the seven endangered grasses 
on his property, but who only knew the Latin names, thus didn't 
really know the plants he was so concerned about--a fine example 
of 
local persipcacity) which must be an axiom of 
local 
lore. 
His 
comments on DDT, mosquito control, gypsy moth spraying, and the 
"army worms" 
in his hay crop illustrate this well. 
On the other 
hand, he clearly perceives certain "wildlife" as competitive with 
his own interests, as when Snow Geese turn sedge marsh (duck 
habitat) into mud flat (allegedly, perhaps true?), or when 
muskrat and horseshoe crab break down his hard won dikes. 
The 
interview also provided some fine examples of "untutored" 
ecological awareness, as 
in the seagull/horseshoe crab egg 
connection and the "adaptive" success of pestiferous species such 
as Phragmites and mosquitos. 
TX02: After concluding our visit (ca 10:30 A.M.), Joe CZ and I 
conversed over coffee in Port Maurice, then I went on my way, to 
explore bayshore and back roads of this part of the Pinelands, as 
yet new to me. 
I found the flock of several hundred Snow geese that the 
Hunn--84 Fieldnotes 
page 46 
pheasant hunter had reported on G—Moore's Beach; 34GT Rd. They were 
very tame. 
Ran out to East Point light, and poked my nose into 
G—Belleplains State Forest; 34GT, which looks rather like Lebanon & 
Wharton State Forests, except perhaps more Ilex opaca, replaced 
in the central Pinelands by Ilex glabra. 
I then drove back roads through Woodbine to Tuckahoe, Corbin 
City, to Mays Landing, then out to Brigantine and a brush with 
Monopolyville (Atlantic City). Such a contrast with the bucolic 
pace of the pinelands. 
As yet no real convincing signs of spring 
among bird or plant life.

very tall, equal the height of pitch pines, 50+ feet and 16" 
diameter. 
Road comes abruptly to Mullica R. shore, river high, 
seems a bit higher than in past visits, though level varies 
little. 
Opposite is fancy new residential development on river 
shore. 
Passing G—Crowley Landing;26GT (Crowleytown) picnic area where 
I took photos and collected some plants on previous visits but 
failed to note precise name of 
location. 
Crossing at BelleHaven 
Lake. Bridge over Wading River still out requiring detour to 
north towards Jenkins Neck on SR563. 
At mile 26 are Interboro 
Gun Club and Bryant Club. 
Lack of Ilex opaca in these woods very 
noticeable after yesterday. 
Ground cover here a very low 
Gaylusaccia; Williamstown Buck Hunters of Maxwell, NJ , near mile 
29. 
At mile 30 crossed west branch of Wading River, water 
definitely high; another good white cedar stand at jct to Bodine 
Field and Godfrey Bridge. 
Then Pinelands Residential Group 
Center at detour turn southeast. 
We will continue north to take 
shortcut from Jenkins Neck to Warren Grove via Lake Oswego 
(ultimately unsuccessful). 
Passing Wading Pines Campground, Godfrey's Bridge, Hawkins 
Point campsite, Jenkins Chapel, Mt. Royal Gun Club, Mick's Canoe 
Rental, all 
in G—Jenkins Neck; 26GT. 
Turn and 3 miles east to Lake 
Oswego, nearly pure pitch pine forest here. 
Nice little bog at 1 
mile on 
left, posted by a Joel Mick, owner, against trapping, 
hunting, & trespassing (note: Mick's canoe rental). 
Few white 
cedars here. 
Low shrub growing in water is Chamaedaphne 
calyculata (leatherleaf), also Kalmia angustifolia here, Azalea 
sp., bright red twigged tall wild blueberry, Clethra, no sound of 
bird or frog. 
Rutgers State University blueberry—cranberry 
research center further along road here. 
Extensive cranberry 
ponds here, all flooded to prevent frost damage. 
2 miles in. 
Pines here just 20-30 feet tall, some 10-15 feet only. 
Road 
blocked by bridge out at Lake Oswego. 
Blue Jays and N. Harrier 
at cranberry ponds. 
What causes "soap suds" effect on outlet

stream at Lake Oswego and elsewhere? 
Back on main road north toward G—Chatsworth; 27GT (SR563). 
Microwave tower, Pine Barrens canoe rental, cranberry bogs and 
blueberry fields. 
Sooey name on mail box. 
More of same. 
Kestrel and belted kingfisher seen. 
Cranberry & blueberry 
openings seem to attract such birds. 
Blueberry fields: some red 
twigged, some more yellow, different varieties?? 
All cranberry 
fields flooded apparently. 
Big operation with warehouses, 
mailboxes say Zapata, Colon?? 
All before mile post 35. 
More of 
blueberry and cranberry fields, bird houses, more white cedar at 
crick crossing. 
Then sycamores and riparian hardwoods, then more 
pines, more cranberries, more kestrels; tall oaks now with lower 
pine understory; interesting layering patterns seen. 
Another 
with scattered tall pines with 10-12 foot tall oak understory. 
Just had possible red squirrel or chipmunk running across road 
with tail 
up. 
An abandoned, overgrown blueberry field. 
Stand of 
white cedar, well tended blueberry field on right; abandoned blue 
berry field with 5 foot pines growing up 
in 
it just before mile 
33. 
Road on right from Duke's bridge, cemetery on 
left, 
Chatsworth, ict. opposite Buzby's general store and restaurant on 
SR532 cut off. 
Passed Demarco Cranberry Co. enterprises. 
Some 
low shrubs at Agamom nursery, certified blueberry place. 
These 
shrubs pruned to a low root crown a few inches high? 
Now passing 
through approximation of pine plains low forest but trees 10-12 
feet tall, some 15-20. 
Snow remaining on south side of road 
here: perhaps colder at this higher elevation in central pines? 
True pine plains on 
left; trees 3 feet tall with scrub oak; could 
just be a recent burn not grown back yet. 
Note also curious 
strip of taller pines along roadside only. 
Jct SR72. 
Passing 
lake inlet with gray birch at road side: white cedar stand. 
Now 
true pine plains on right at mile post 10, Coyle Field airstrip, 
just before mile post 11; crossing into Barnegat Twp., Ocean Co. 
Still 
in midst of plains... 
TX02: Three hour visit with Jack Cervetto (see PFP84—AEH002 and 
written notes in section 4 below), 11 A.M. to 2 P.M. G—Warren 
Grove; 56GT 
Any time you want to talk about the woods, I'll 
be 
there, Jack said, so I plan another visit this trip. 
Very 
knowledgeable guy. 
Different kinds of bottoms, of berries: 
grouse berry, bilberry, tall swamp blue(berry), upland 
blue(berry), all kinds of huckleberries. 
For him a huckleberry 
is by definition wild: "blueberries" are found only in 
cultivation, derived by efforts of Ms. White and others since 
turn of century from tall swamp blue(berry)/huckleberry. 
This 
usage, of course, 
is at odds with the "official" distinction 
between blueberry (Vaccinium in part) and huckleberry 
(Gaylusaccia). 
Jack does note that some huckleberries have large 
seeds, presumably species of Gaylusaccia, others don't, presumably 
Vacccinium species. 
Big seeded ones less choice. 
Big seeded 
ones include bilberry and upland blue(berry), while tall swamp 
blue(berry) and grouse berry sound like Vacciniums. 
Each has its 
own flavor. 
Jack related how they used to harvest grouse berries 
Hunn--84 Fieldnotes 
page 50 
in 
"clay bottom" habitats. 
Very scarce now, for some reason. 
Used a scoop to hit bushes and simultaneously catch the berries. 
A favorite kind. 
In clay bottoms, grouseberry mixed with 
"savannah grass," a sedge (collected:EH1639). 
"Turkey oak" _ 
Chestnut oak, this his favorite burning wood after swamp maple 
("the hottest wood"). 
Also got sample he identified as black oak 
(seems to be Q. 
velutinus). 
"Pin oak" (=scarlet oak?) said to 
have paler, smoother bark than black oak. 
"Lump moss" 
is a kind 
of moss, collected and sold to window dressers in cities. 
He 
then called a ground lichen (like reindeer lichen?) just dead 
lump moss. 
"Sheet moss" found 
in 
"oak bottoms," just roll 
it up 
like turf. 
Then of course there's prototypical moss = sphagnum 
moss, of moss pulling fame. 
I don't know if he uses the term 
sphagnum. 
Talked to two men who had paid Jack to cut firewood on his 
land. 
They were nutting white or chestnut oak, 
it 
looked like. 
The younger man (in his twenties) cut ca 12 
inch diameter logs to 
the length of his pick—up truck bed, for later cutting and 
splitting to order for his customers--Jack says he sells the 
right to cut on his land for $30/cord, while a ready out & cured 
cord of fireplace wood (larger size) may sell for $100-120 cord, 
of smaller "stove wood" for $90/cord. 
Thus middleman 
cutter/hauler earns a good bit. 
Discussion of permit hassles 
Jack had recently with the Pinelands commission/twp./state. 
His 
permit (assigned for life unless violations noted) was pulled 
because someone reported that the woodcutters on his land just 
took the big stuff, 
leaving the branches, etc., and he had not 
flagged the required roadside buffer of ca 30 feet (my estimate). 
He complained that the inspectors may know the woods but they 
don't know the business, as the small stuff had not been left to 
rot but was to be hauled out by someone else for "stove wood." 
He has now flagged the roadside buffer area and has his permit 
back, but it took 3 months' hassle and loss of income. 
In his 
younger days, he notes, that delay and loss of winter wood 
cutting income would have really hurt, though he's not so 
in need 
nowadays. 
The older wood cutter (in 30's,40's?) cut smaller pieces 16" 
to 3' 
ca 6" diameter "stove wood." 
One truck load = about 1/2 
cord. 
If cut now, 
it'll 
be ready to burn next winter. Cutting 
clam stakes and men cutting firewood is just north of milepost 11 
on SR539 north of Warren Grove. 
Jack's ecotypes of pitch pine, bull pine which grows in 
swamps, upland (regular?) pine, and dwarf pine of pine plains, 
seem more salient than species distinctions, as between pitch 
pine (constituting maybe 99.9% of all pines nearby) and short— 
leaf/two—needle pines. 
Unclear to me 
if he intended those two 
latter terms to refer to P. echinata and P. 
virginiana or used 
them as synonyms for P. 
echinata. 
Unmarked, prototypical pitch 
pine not called "pitch pine" by him, at least spontaneously in 
our conversations today. 
Question to pursue. 
Sense here 
in that 
Hunn--84 Fieldnotes 
page 51 
rarer pines not likely to have much utility while ecotypes, being 
each widespread, would be useful to distinguish. 
Intriguing that 
"bull pine" not distinguishable by external morphology, according 
to Jack, but identified by habitat alone. 
Only when cut do 
its 
critical, distinguishing features, 
i.e., tighter grain, become 
visible. 
Also noteworthy, his ability to distinguish cedars that 
are rotten at the core by the fact that they don't "grow right," 
e.g., crooked, etc. 
This a useful talent, saving the labor of 
cutting bad trees down. 
"Pine bottom" versus "oak bottom": sandy soil favors pine, 
better soils the oak. 
Note how first settlers always chose to 
build and farm on oak bottoms. 
Now you see a patch of pine 
in 
oak bottom, you know it's where the land had been cleared; only 
if oak stumps removed will pine take over, otherwise oak 
rejuvenates from stumps. 
But "pine bottom" different from these 
anthropogenic pine patches in "oak bottom." 
Oak bottom soils 
richer. 
Partly due to oakleaf humus contribution. 
Jct SR539 north of SR72, going through pure pine 30-50 feet 
tall with scrub (blackjack) oak understory, 5-6 feet high. 
Now 
pines getting shorter, perhaps just second growth after fire? 
Now just 10-15 feet tall. 
Passed 4-5 3-wheel dirt bikers out for 
sunday run. 
Along 539 stop found a nice post oak with 
distinctive, deeply-cut, blank seamed bark, unlike white oak. 
Photo #16 here of "sheep's sorrel," that Jack described as 
poisonous (collected: EH1636). 
Also blackjack oak understory 
here. 
Inkberry. 
Just crested a high hill, almost a mountain, 
just south of milepost 20, then dropped down a couple of stepped 
slopes ca 100 feet of elevation to a small cedar bog/crick/run. 
TX03: Jack Cervetto's "wire grass" 
is apparently Hudsonia 
ericoides. 
Two more dirt bikers. 
Now past Wynnwood at G-Whiting; 
52GT residential development, then Timber Green development. 
At 
milepost 23 running into more black oak mixed with pines, but 
still predominantly pines. 
Passed Exstrom Rd. & McMahon rd. and 
RR tracks. 
Now mixed deciduous stand at Crestwood village. 
Just 
spotted Allyn Manufacturing Co. on right. 
Seems obscurely marked 
and a bit run down. 
Sizeable parking lot in front; property has 
half a dozen or more barracks-like warehouse buildings; yard 
holds about half-dozen semi-truck trailers with North Penn label. 
In windows of one warehouse I can see what looks like big stacks 
of perhaps cattails, cut and bundled and maybe Pampas grass 
heads? 
In yard are stacks eighth-round cut cedar boards (bark 
attached), .some new, some weathered, tied in bundles. 
Manchester Twp. just s. 
of jcts. with SR530 & SR70. 
Another 
nice martin house at road maintenance shed. 
Passing burned area 
along SR70 noted in December, opposite Buckingham Picnic Area; 
note some pines are already sprouting new needle clusters from 
the bark of trunk. 
Stopped at nice extensive swamp, with 
towering cedar forest across ca 1/4 mile from road. 
Lot of 
Jack's "heff brush", that is, 
leatherleaf, 
lot of wild cranberry, 
Hunn--84 Fieldnotes 
page 52 
sphagnum moss, azaleas along edges, stand of birch along highway. 
Collected white cedar, 
leatherleaf, and "sheep's laurel" here 
(EH1638,1637, and 1636, respectively). 
Mile 35 just west of this big swamp. 
Beyond mile 34 is 
junction to White's bog. 
At mile 33 is flooded cranberry bog. 
Cross rr tracks past G—Country Lakes; 21GT development. 
Extensive 
stands along here of riparian hardwoods. 
Now at G—Mt. Misery; 27GT turnoff. 
Talked with Freeman 
Taylor's friend--young man who owns the livestock Freeman tends. 
Freeman will return in ca 30 minutes. 
Noted that Freeman had 
received certificate of appreciation from PFP and that someone 
had been calling about taking photos, but that Freeman is shy 
about talking on phone, hard to pin down on phone, not averse to 
photos. 
His sister is Ada Court who lives west of Pemberton. 
Crescent Heights area. 
There most days. 
Now found some turkey beard stands near McDonald's Branch 
and South Branch south of Mt. Misery. 
Jack Cervetto commented that red squirrel's often steal his 
corncob pipes to gnaw on. 
At MacDonald's branch there's sweet 
bay and birch. 
Maple, cedar, etc. 
Tulips starting to come up 
in 
Freeman Taylors' yard. 
Wild turkeys in yard not wild. 
Freeman 
was slopping the pigs, has 8 from a litter two weeks old. 
Freeman recounted how his sister Ada had saved a young bog, 
ca 5 years old, a relative?, who had been very badly burned, and 
who was being botched worse by the doctors. 
She took him out of 
the hospital and treated him with "curly fern," same term Jack 
Cervetto used for the famous "curly grass fern" presumably. 
Boy 
still has "web" under arm from burns. 
Doctors want to cut it, 
but Ada won't let them. 
Freeman also noted there's a great horned owl 
nesting in a 
cedar grove near his place (perhaps cedar groves favored by 
them?). 
Then spotted a considerable roadside grove of Pinus 
virginiana, perhaps planted, perhaps not. 
along SR70 between Mt. 
Misery and Four Mile. 
Also some white pines near here. 
Just 
east of Presidential Lakes turnoff. 
Snakes won't be out, 
according to Freeman, until warm days of early May. 
Took photo 
in Chatsworth of old Whitehorse Inn, #17. 
South 
of G—Chatsworth; 27GT some "savannah bottoms". 
At G—Speedwell; 27GT, historical marker. 
Sycamores about, 
hardwood patch. 
Heading west from Speedwell toward Friendship. 
Passed small area of pines—oaks cleared of underbrush by fire. 
Another nice example of "savannah bottom": phot #18, at 
bridge at G—Friendship; 26GT. 
Hunn--84 Fieldnotes 
page 53 
Photo #19 of abandoned Central New Jersey Railroad tracks 
near G—Carranza Memorial; 25GT, Phots #20 & 21 of the memorial 
itself. 
Just opposite a nice little stand of Pinus echinata, 
sample allowed direct comparison with P. 
virginiana. 
Bark 
blackish on P. echinata. 
More cedar bogs near Wharton Tract Unit, satellite of 
G—Yardville; 25GT Youth Correction and Reception center, a 
formidable prison, 
it appears from a distance. 
Road to Hampton 
Furnace and Atsion impassable due to deep puddles in 
road. 
Saw a 
poached deer skeleton here, got splashed by giant 4—wheel drive 
pickup out for a romp on back roads. 
Abandoned, overgrown cranberry & blueberry patches south of 
Tabernacle. 
Turning on Bozarthtown Rd. 
More P. virginiana. 
Grange Gund Club at jct Tuckerton & Dingletown Rds. 
The farm 
country begins along Dingletown Rd. as we seem to be 
leaving the 
west edge of the pines. 
Mostly hardwood woodlots among fields 
here. 
Passed residential development. 
Then south on US206 and 
back into some pine—oak. 
Extensive recent burn on east side of 
206 south of G—Atsion; 23GT on Burlington—Atlantic Co. 
line. 
Some 
blueberry fields in pure pine woods, then SR536, G—Waterford; 32GT 
juct, paradise lakes campground, mile 4, 
then mile 2 suddenly 
into orchard and farm country. 
TX04: WRITTEN NOTES; JACK CERVETTO VISIT G—Warren Grove; 56GT 
Jack recently the subject of a Turner Broadcasting Co. Cable 
TV special (he has a videotape of 
it) about his working in the 
woods, Atlanta based. 
Firewood distinctions: "fireplace wood" versus "stove wood." 
Former is 
larger, more expensive. 
Maple: two varieties here; 
upland and swamp, of which the swamp maple is the "hottest wood 
around," and his preference for home heating (but can't burn 
it 
now because his wife, Pearl Rita, now somewhat asthmatic). 
But 
few people use 
it because it's hard to get out. 
Grows to 10-11" 
diameter. 
Next best is "turkey oak" (=chestnut oak?), but any 
oak will 
do, all are good and all 
are sold indiscriminately for 
firewood. 
There are 8 varieties of oaks about (he read that in 
Harshberger, pronounced Hershberger, book). 
He recalls white, 
pin, turkey, black, rock (very little of this one here), and 
forgets the local name of the dwarf oak of the plains (not 
"blackjack oak"). 
Jack owns now 600-700 acres of woods and uses it all 
in his 
living. 
Told story about a George Cranmer, Warren Grove old 
timer who would be ca 100 now 
if 
living, who had never left the 
area. 
Was invited to go to Philadelphia by some younger friends 
one time. 
When he got back, was quizzed closely by assembled 
neighbors. 
What did he think of 
it? 
Why, 
in Philly "people live 
on top of one another out there!" 
How were the mosquitos in 
Philly? 
"Why, a mosquito couldn't live 
in Philadelphia. 
Hunn--84 Fieldnotes 
page 54 
(Implication of 
last, that it was therefore no place to 
live?) 
About pine cone business, he was 
in 
it when it was big 
in 
1930's and 1940's. 
Bought then from pickers, forced them open, 
then sold to nurseries for decorative brush. 
Jack grew some 
(from the plains) from seed 
in his yard and though it grew 
twisted like plains pines 
it grew taller, so partly soil, he 
concludes. 
He says the people just "bled" those trees till they 
wouldn't produce; now they're producing better. 
A "Jersey cone" 
is famous as the best, the hardest known, small, but they open up 
just like a rose. 
Now however, florists have to get cones from a 
hard—coned pine from Italy! due to 
lack of supply from here. 
Jack asked 
if I knew "Dr. Rubinstein." I said no. 
Turns out 
it's Dr. Nora! Rubinstein he meant. 
She's talked a lot with him. 
She says 
in woods work he (Jack) 
is the doctor! 
This week he needs to out 100 bean poles (for "pole beans," 
limas) for a farmer down 
in south Jersey. (When a friend found 
out where the farmer was getting his cedar poles he called to 
order some too.) 
Cedar is best because it 
lasts almost forever. 
He out 25 28 footers last week for Marina pilings in Waretown. 
Joe Czarnecki commented that cedar doesn't grow bank 
if cut. 
Jack says no way, just have to 
leave the poor trees that grow 
along the sloughs (pronounced sl—ow—s, 
like 
in "ow" 
it hurts), 
these not good to cut but produce lots of seeds. 
It'll come 
back, though it takes about 100 years. 
The place he's cutting 
now has been cut three times, first in 1745, then 
in mid-1800, 
and now. 
Good lumber produced in 
100 years. 
Find it then with 
almost clean boles 10-12" diameter with lower branches worn off 
from rubbing together in wind or from growing so close together. 
If any tree fails to keep pace growing it'll 
be crowded out and 
die, so all tops tend to be equal, though diameters may vary a 
great deal 
all mixed in together, from 4" to 12". 
Trees with 
many low branches will 
be full of knots, thus these tall clean 
trunks are prime. 
Was a fire that burned tops of some cedar 
swamp he was overseeing for another man (he now owns 
it) 
in 
1936. 
It's just now coming back, with trees they call 
"brassy," that 
is, a young tree with lots of 
low branches, full of knots. 
He cuts clam stakes (2" by 16-18'), channel markers (3" by 
25'), cause channels are deeper than clamming areas. 
On the upland, cedar swamp boundary: "you can almost slice 
it" 
it's so clear cut. 
Other trees around here include birch, maple, sassafras, and 
gum. 
Birch cut up for decorative use, all 
different sizes, use 
whole tree except smallest branches. 
Maple best firewood, gum no 
good as wood, rots away 
in six months, got no grain, but makes up 
for it by being prettiest flowering in spring, first bright color 
in fall. 
Jack dealt with a guy in Tappan, New York, who did all 
Hunn--84 Fieldnotes 
page 55 
sorts of decorative work, colored all 
kinds of grasses, and sold 
them to window dressers, 
including the "curly fern," just what he 
wanted! 
Joe Czarnecki asked about carnivorous pitcher plants. 
Jack 
apparently misunderstood as he called them "whippoorwill shoes" 
and later "pine orchids," the Cypripedium acaule orchid. 
Told 
story of how when pulling moss they'd stack it on the hussocks in 
the marsh where the cedars grew (without these hussocks the 
cedars would drown, as can be seen when beavers dam up a swamp) 
to dry out 2-3 days, then come back to haul and bale it. 
When 
you picked up a load of this dry moss you got wet because the 
"whippoorwill shoes" growing in the moss held the water in the 
lips of their flowers. 
On sphagnum moss in a bog, "there's no 
rug prettier, with its golden fringe around it." 
On sphagnum 
moss: a bushel wet weighs ca 200 Ibs, dry only 15 lbs. 
A bale of 
dry sphagnum moss is 2' 
by 2' 
by 34" and weighs ea 32 pounds. 
But it will be heavier on a day with high humidity. 
Moss 
business was big 1850-1950, they hauled it out by the railroad 
car full. 
Used everywhere by florists because of water retention 
qualities, to hold moisture for floral displays, shipping of 
plants, etc. 
Now use styrofoam because moss hard to get. 
Many 
moss pullers have quit, taken jobs that pay better and are less 
work, as 
in 
local defense industries. 
Notes that moss keeps 
coming back when you pull 
it because "moss is not a plant, 
it's a 
fungus"! 
Takes four years to come back good; they used to pull 
it after three when demand was high. 
If you didn't pull 
it 
it'd 
rot anyway. 
On whippoorwill shoe: grows best in "springy bottom," that 
is, a swamp area with an active spring coming up under the moss. 
Even pine cones respond to the humidity in the air, close up 
when its damper, like it 
is today. 
Fire season is from first of April to June, before leaves 
come out; but pitch pine'll burn anytime it can get started. 
Pines survive fire, but oak 
is killed, because oak sap right 
under bark (?). 
His wife is Pearl Rita Cervetto, four generation Warren 
Grove family, ancestors worked the Marthas Furnace in colonial 
times. 
Jack was born in Clifton, N.J., and moved to Warren Grove 
with his father and family at 7 years of age, went to the one— 
room school here. 
Then the family returned for a time to the 
city, but Jack came back to Warren Grove when he turned 21. 
He 
kept smelling the pine pitch and had to come back!

TX01: Jim Stasz and his friend Ed Boyd met me at Hammonton for 
our transect of the pinelands habitats. 
Ed 
is a flight 
controller by profession, working at the Philadelphia airport, 
but a birder and natural history buff originally from the DC 
area, having lived at Sicklerville, NJ, for less than two years. 
As we drove along Jim described the natural history points of 
interest from his point of view. 
We also discussed the general 
issue of how the pinelands (a new term, Jim noted, that he rarely 
uses) 
is defined vis a vis other South Jersey regions. 
That 
commentary is detailed in PFP84—AEHO03/004. 
We began at 8 A. M. 
route was as follow

At Chatswor 
West Plain. 
We tur 
station for 1.1 mil

Pine Barrens plant, 
obscure, but of sufficient botanical interest that Harshberger 
named the Plains forest type the Coremal. 
Also found evergreen 
foliage here of pyxie, sand myrtle, bearberry, Hudsonia, and 
trailing arbutus. 
Then further east on 70 to Barnegat light, for 
contrast. 
Returning south via route 9 through G—Tuckerton; 47GT to 
Brigantine National Wildlife Refuge. 
Then west past the 
Oceanville bog, a favorite and convenient site for many Pine 
Barrens bog species, 
including curly grass fern, etc. 
Then past 
G—Camp Kilmer; 12GT's ruins--favored site for Pine Snake and skink 
of herpetological enthusiasts, and to Hammonton. 
and returned around 4:30 P.

TX01: Continuation of pinelands transect with Jim Stasz, this 
morning going west from Hammonton to the mouth of Old Mans Creek 
on the Delaware River. 
First stop was at New Brooklyn Lake, 
headwaters of the Great Egg Harbor River, a Pine Barrens stream, 
but now in the midst of a rather heavily built-up area with lots 
of early morning commuter traffic. 
A patch of woods across 
(downstream) from the lake (a millrace pond?) was a wildlife 
management area. 
From here we proceeded through Williamstown to 
Clayton and the "Glassboro Woods," an outlier patch of Pineland 
forest with some interesting transitional floral and faunal 
elements (detailed in PFP84-AEHO05) Upland woods are strongly 
reminiscent of core Pine Barrens pine/oak stands, but the swampy 
woods have just a few white cedars, the forest dominated instead 
by a southern swamp hardwood forest with such species as sweet 
gum, sour gum/tupelo, tulip tree (a fine straight trunk on this 
one), etc., rare in the central pine swamp forests. 
Glassboro woods are at the headwaters of the Mullica River, 
another (and the southwesternmost) Pine Barrens river system. 
From Glassboro we proceeded across the divide into west Jersey 
drainage systems (into the Delaware River) at Aura, then through 
Harrisonville to the Pedricktown marshes following the course of 
Oldmans Creek, one of the few streams on this side of the divide 
not polluted by industrial activities. 
We could trace the course 
of the stream by the mature forest corridor left along the 
streamcourse by the steeply incised nature of the drainage 
pattern. 
Here the uplands are more rolling than in the pine 
barrens and are all 
in cultivation or woodlot. 
The streamside 
forest include huge silvery American beeches plus pignut hickory, 
walnut, etc., with the variety of oaks. 
Pedricktown marsh is a 
productive estuary full of wintering swans and other waterfowl. 
It contrasts in this regard with neighboring estuaries such as 
that of the Raccoon Creek, a more polluted stream nearly devoid 
of such wildlife. 
From Pedricktown we drove northeast to 
Thorooughfare to examine a piece of a narrow strip of Delaware River 
margin Virginia (or scrub) pine (Pinus virginiana) woods. 
This 
long narrow strip (only a few hundred feet wide here) 
is pure 
scrub pine (except for planted eastern white pines) and preferred 
winter habitat for saw-whet owls. 
It may represent the ancient 
Hunn--84 Fieldnotes 
page 59 
Atlantic shoreline. 
Also noticeable here and generally west of 
the Jersey/Pine Barrens divide 
is the abundance of weedy species 
noticeably lacking in the pinelands, even on disturbed soils 
there. 
We also noted a number of 
local place names indicative of 
the more nutritious soils of west Jersey (derivative of the 
greensand substrate), such as Marltown, "marl" referring to the 
greensand itself, once mined for use as a mineral fertilizer. 
Thence returned to Hammonton. 
At several sites between 
Hammonton and Glassboro choruses of frogs were in full throat on 
this balmy first day of spring. 
Jim was not sure of their 
identity and we never could sneak up on one to get a look at it. 
However, 
it seems most likely the choruses included both s.pring 
peepers (Hyla crucifer) and New Jersey Chorus frogs (Pseudacris 
triseriata kalmi). 
I also located two Eastern Red—backed 
Salamanders (Plethodon cinerea) by turning over bark. 
This 
is 
the common salamander species throughout south Jersey. 
TX02: I napped that afternoon due to Kaypro late night 
exhaustion, but explored the section of Route 542 closed by the 
bridge out at G—Wading River; 26GT. 
Found a 6-8 foot tall species 
of Spartina growing at the water's edge here, perhaps S. 
michauxiana? 
Then returned via G—Lower Bank; 26GT, G—Weekstown; 
12GT, and the G—Sweetwater; 12GT developments. 
I also visited 
Batsto to try to speak with Annie Carter, but she was apparently 
resting. 
Listened there at dusk for courting woodcocks but heard 
nothing but spring peepers.

These notes were keystroked from handwritten notes. 
It 
is hoped that all 
the spellings and words are correct. 
Lou and Allen (Allyn?) Golin of Allyn Manufacturing Co., 
Whiting, NJ. 
Both father and son have a very definite concept of 
the true "Piney," a vanishing breed they believe -- all 
the real 
Pineys have died, often of self-inflicted gunshot wounds to the 
head -- according to Lou. 
Pineys work when they need to but not 
"rationally" according to profit motive. 
Lou provided me a 
detailed example of how raising the price paid for a product by 
50% leads to a 30% reduction in supply rather than an 
increase! 
<cf. Winans on African natives> 
Fixed need motive <But lower the 
price and they go elsewhere for better returns according to 
Allen>. 
Pineys are leathery and brown at an early age, don't 
bathe, they are naturally repellent to mosquitoes and sand fleas 
that would keep regular people from the woods work such as 
cattail cutting. 
(Lou stopped short of saying they smelled bad, 
just distinctive!) 
Debated whether Harry Payne was a Piney 
because he's black, though he's lived here all his life. 
Allen's 
classic Piney and first supplier was Roy Romans (shot himself 
because jilted by Helen Ridgway -- who 
is still 
living and 
in her 
70s). 
Recommended real Piney types or contacts: 
1. 
Jack Richardson (84 years old, 
609-723-8250), 
competitor and supplier, of Wrightstown. 
2. 
George Mick (87 years old) of Roosevelt City. 
Another "clan" of Pineys are those who "manipulate" the true 
Pineys or the situation. 
They would never pick cones themselves 
but buy cones off of others. 
They are smart (thus not real 
Pineys!). 
e.g. Jack Richardson? 
Bill Wasiowich not a real Piney, (Lou doesn't really know 
how, 
implied, but not explicated). 
"Even Bill" now passing off 
old, gray (dark) cones with young ones. 
Stone family. 
Pineys also never get sick and keep working 
until 80 or 90! 
e.g. Jack Richardson's mother, packing sacks of 
Hunn--84 Fieldnotes 
page 61 
cones (30-40 Ibs) at age 90+. 
Betty Wright. -- originally a Bowker <Elwood Bowker another 
true Piney> -- introduced as one of original Whiting families 
(Pineys): 
she 
is about 45 perhaps with a carrot red permanent 
(but young body). 
Works in the factory. 
She seemed proud of 
it. 
According to Allen interbreeding characteristic of the Piney 
families. 
We discussed Bill Wasiowich, how shy he 
is; 
"he'll never 
look you 
in the eye" or explain why he wasn't bringing in so many 
cones. 
But when offered $7 instead of $6/ 1000 <figures?> he 
started bringing in 25,000 cones a week! 
Company sold 6-7 million cones a year before (1970?). 
Now a 
few hundred thousand <yes, do 
import them from Italy>. 
Cost of 
labor the critical factor: 
now most of their business is with 
foreign stock. 
Company now employs 40 inside employees in fall, 20 minimum 
rest of year (as now) plus outside suppliers (Lou). 
Once (max 
1978-79) employed 80, 50 by day shift, 30 at night (Lou). 
Or 50-
60 outside and 50-60 inside (Allen). 
Grossed $2,000,000 1978-79, 
now down to $1,500,000, but profit margin small. 
Lou gave me a tour of plant: 
cedar slabs (from Jack 
Cervetto?), cone curing shed (two heaters with fan, 135-140 
degree temperature): 
old cones may not open, thus not choice. 
But now they are less selective. 
They used to use a grader to 
sort sizes, but no 
longer worth the effort. 
German statice dyed 
whitish; pampas grass from Brazil; potpourri: mixed rose and 
flower pieces that smelled fantastic; "fern frond"= sensitive 
fern <local product>; grape wreaths <three sizes>, this product 
invented by Allen, now found all 
over! 
bean weed = moth mullens 
imported from Europe! 
Sweet huck, birch poles and branches, 
carved branches -- these colored or dipped in glue and coated 
with glitter. 
"Swans" formed by birch twigs. 
Note: 
leaves of 
sweet huck (sugar huck) described by Lou as "When that junk 
starts to come out." 
Photos in b&w 2-8 --grape vines and Allen Golin. 
Wayne Pittman is approximately 25 years old <been collecting 
for about 6 years for Allyn and Jack Richardson, etc.> 
brought 
in 
164 @ 50 cents and 11 @ $1.00 grape wreaths (45 seconds to tie 
one!). 
But are many people out collecting (!)so you have to 
look 
hard sometimes to find a good supply. 
He also collects (as do all 
his brothers and other friends) 
birch, sugar huck <found best on burned over area>, fern frond. 
They don't do cones or cattails: 
less money for effort. 
Wayne 
is grandson of Asa Pittman, famous snake man (book 
Hunn--84 Fieldnotes

written about him). 
House is just North of SR 70 just west of 
Conrail bridge (Upton Station Bridge), 
little white house off 
fire lane.

Mother stuck her head out the door briefly to 
yell 
at Brother #2 (the one with Wayne yesterday -- apparently a

truck wouldn't start. 
The third brother was working with the

Visit John Sinton (4:30 pm-8:30 pm) at his home, 135 Old New 
York Road, Port Republic. 
A pleasing wooden house with solar 
(southern exposure) green house . . . and apple orchard on a 
woodsy acre of 
land. 
He was just celebrating M 
-- reading 
about it 
in the Atlantic City paper -- his resignation from the 
Pinelands Commission (as Atlantic County's representative -- a 
post he's held for two years or so) citing pressure of work or 
other time commitments. 
His appointed replacement -- I forget 
the name -- is a local builder who had 
been active in the South 
Jersey secessionist campaign, and an altogether bad choice in 
John's opinion. 
John's current assessment of the (at least 
partial) failure of the Commission to avoid the trap of 
bureaucratic rigidity <a self-protective, live by the rules 
response to cases> is expressed in the final version of his book, 
due out in November (Johns Hopkins Press). 
Small world: 
John's a Stanford grad (1960) 
in History 
(barely, he says; he didn't appreciate the place), then to U. 
Mass (?) for graduate work in Environmental Policy Management. 
Hunn--84 Fieldnotes 
page 65 
He has been at Stockton since 1971 (?) when it was opened, as he 
had the chance then to get in on the building of a new 
interdisciplinary program in Environmental Sciences, one of the 
few such programs still alive at Stockton SC. 
But he sees his intense involvement in Pinelands research as 
over and he's now more heavily involved in "meaning of place" 
research. 
Ditto his coauthor, Berger. 
He 
is 
an "obsessive" fly 
fisherman -- used to be an obsessive birder (!) but, he notes, 
you can only support one obsession at a time. 
His (2nd) wife, 
Wendy, a social worker was due home later. 
The family includes 
five boys, of both original families. 
He 
is a committed "house 
husband"/ family person, clearly. 
He believes the Pinelands cultural—ecological field guide 
idea 
is excellent. 
Apparently Johns Hopkins Press contracted 
with a botanist expert to write a natural history field guide to 
the Pinelands but got a historical monograph instead which they 
refused to publish. 
This seems the most productive direction to 
pursue, realistic product wise. 
He would like to see us get 
something together by mid 1985. 
But it would require more 
fieldwork, to follow up many points raised. 
He 
intends to 
consult an editor at Johns Hopkins Press about it. 
Poor quality of Jersey wines, he says, 
is due to the 
necessity of substituting Vitis labrusca or hybrid grapes for 
European V. vinifera due to climate (too wet), limited growth of 
V. 
vinifera. 
Altogether an enjoyable and informative evening.

Interesting fallow field patterns on this Pine forest 
margin. 
Grain fields (in wheat or rye? see specimen) 
in fallow 
are mostly covered in wooly vetch (Vicia villosa) now in full 
blue bloom. 
Cherry orchards and blueberry fields also go fallow. 
Blueberry fields here almost ripe, first hint of blue color. 
Creeks here dominated by red maple (Acer rubrum). 
Catbirds very 
conspicuous here. 
Conspicuous roadside orange lily is apparently 
the exotic day lily, Hemerocallis fulva. 
Milkweed and "Indian 
hemp" (Apocynum cannabinum) 
in flower, a key plant for Plateau 
indians but just a weed here? 
Wild garlic conspicuous along 
roadsides (Allium vineale)--escaped from cultivation. 
Tomatoes 
coming out green; squash or pumpkin fields also. 
Bobwhites 
particularly like the edges of fallow fields and orchards and 
adjacent woodlots. 
Ponds with Nuphar and Nymphaea in bloom. 
Local markets advertisin "Jersey corn," etc., "jersey" an 
important modifier. 
Pick—your—own strawberries advertised. 
Abandoned cherry orchard (see specimen) dominated by sweet 
vernal grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum) and clover (Trifolium 
arvense) with a few scattered invasive pitch pine (Virginia pine 
along adjacent road) and eastern red cedar. 
Opposite this field 
is a woodlot with some exotics such as red mulberry (Morus 
rubra). 
Japanese honeysuckle conspicuously in flower (Lonicera 
Japonica). 
A field sparrow nest in the abandoned orchard.

below for bear oak; rusty beneath for blackjack; clear green 
below for black and scarlet oaks. 
Note blueish cast to white oak 
and coarser, rough texture of post oak. 
Post oak bark 
is only 
slightly more heavily ridged than that of white oak. 
Found 
bigtoothed aspen (Populus grandidentata) scattered about.

Made 
appointment for a visit Tuesday for breakfast and then a tour of

Found them home; Leo 
working on a new crop of cattails (all Narrow—leaved cats, Typha

He had 50,000 set out in baskets

This the product of 5

If cut at just the

is possible to due 
it by eye 
in the field. 
Then leaned outward all 
around the basket in a rather delicate 
balance--care exerted to make sure baskets don't tip over. 
He 
also had a few "mini" cattails brought in by someone else. 
Leo 
said they were no good. 
These were already mostly dry, of 
shorter lengths. 
A recurring theme of Leo's conversations is the 
preferability of doing 
it yourself--correctly and efficiently, 
without complaining--rather than paying somebody else to do 
it. 
In any case, always pay piece work rates, never by the hour! 
I had noticed a small mill just down the road from Landy's 
toward the highway. 
He said 
it was Jack Abbott's cedar mill. 
He 
likes the way Abbott works; uses every bit of the cedar including 
the saw dust, which is trucked off (for some use I didn't catch). 
The yard was piled with cedar logs about 8 feet long and 12+ 
inches in diameter. 
He makes lumber, not just shakes, etc. 
Also seasonal 
is dock (apparently Rumex crispus), of which 
he has recently collected 5000, which are hanging in bundles up 
to dry. 
The goal 
is 
to pick them not too green, but not too far 
gone. 
If too green they won't turn the bright russet color 
preferred (photos taken to show this) but rather just a dull 
brown. 
If too far gone they will 
"shed" their seeds and are 
worthless. 
Tied in bundles of 25. 
Also drying is broccoli and 
the slightly smaller podded mustard. 
He recently drove all 
around Millville, Vineland, Richland, etc., with Hazel 
looking 
for a field of 
it. 
When you find it, 
ask permission, normally 
granted as they're "just weeds" to the farmer--though mustard 
Hunn--84 Fieldnotes 
page 70 
grown by some Italians as a potherb--and to be plowed under. 
Also drying was "fluffy grass" (obviously a Brumus, possibly B. 
tectorum) and pepper grass (Lepidium virginicum M). 
We 
discussed names: they often make up their own 
if they don't know 
it otherwise. 
Figure they are justified in that common and 
scientific names highly variable. 
Examples: their "brown burs" 
they were told si 
"bush clover" or "rabbit foot." 
(It 
is 
Lespedeza in the clover family.) 
Their "feather grass," they 
were told 
is Japanese knotwood (knotweed ?). 
Hazel showed me some German statice (actually I picked it up 
off the floor). 
Whe said 
it was being thrown away (by someone 
else) because the stems were brown rather than the preferred 
grayish green (as shown on other plants in a floral display she 
had made up for a customer (photographed). 
But Leo avers the 
brown 
is just as good. 
Also the flowers (actually persistent 
sepals) looked different. 
I got a sample. 
Though German statice 
originated in Germany, 
it 
is now grown in California and New 
Jersey, etc. 
This display contained some of just about all 
of 
their materials: German statice, sea grass, sand grass, Indian 
grass, narrowleaf cat, foxtail millet, dock, baby oats, fern 
seed, marsh grass, foxtails, brown burrs, heather, wild wheat, 
reed, and reed plume. 
Leo gets the "baby oats" (Manisurus sp., fide E. Vivian, a 
grass) in ditches near Lower Bank. 
Orchard grass drying there 
is 
Dactylis glomerata, with a couple of timothy inadvertently mixed 
in (Phleum pratense). 
Another new grass was drying there. 
As 
yet he hasn't named it (Agrostis sp.? or Holcus lanatus??). 
He 
says 
it feels like velvet (the inflorescence. 
Another Leo theme: 
leave the business end of 
it to Hazel. 
He wants nothing to do with that nor with growing stuff: he only 
likes the wild plants. 
Odds and ends of plants on his work 
bench: "blackberry lily" seeds: "almost extinct" he says. 
Soft 
brome (Bromus mollis, 
it seems, he doesn't have name for it). 
He 
picked some one year. 
Doesn't believe it 
is cultivated. 
Heather, yarrow not yet ready to pick. 
Leo on the Pinelands Commission: they're worthless, bugging 
ordinary people about building outbuildings on their property but 
letting the fat cats get away with putting in a landfill dump 
right next door. 
This refers to the current cause celebre 
locally: known by the bumper sticker "Mullica Citizens say Dump 
the Dump." 
Why doesn't the Pinelands Commission do something to 
stop that? 
Cause there's big money behind; Atlantic City 
garbage. 
Supposedly they will 
incinerate it first, but Leo 
is 
suspicious that'll be the wedge. 
The proposed site is just 4 
miles away. 
A republican county commissioner (?) candidate is 
running on an anti—dump ticket (signs posted widely). 
Tuesday 
night is a last gasp local hearing in Atlantic City (I was 
leafletted about it by a passing lady while birdwatching later 
that day: "she commented I looked like a nature lover so should 
Hunn--$4 Fieldnotes 
page 71 
be interested in coming to the meeting.) 
Leo cuts cattails all along the Mullica, at low tide you can 
walk 
in, find a good area (which you can't do just by driving the 
roads, as so many free lance cattail cutters try to do), and pack 
it out. 
You have to get out of the truck and walk to find the 
good cats, he says. 
Possibly we'll 
go this afternoon (later 
ruled out as his partner didn't show, maybe Tuesday morning, will 
call). 
Don't wear boots,they'II just fill 
up with mud (though he 
once say a 75+ year old cattail cutter out in full hip waders). 
He prefers old sneakers and pants. 
You just got to expect to get 
mud up to your eye brows. 
We discussed my visit to Allyn's and Jack Richardson's 
health (none too good, apparently). 
Leo doesn't think of them as 
competition. 
He doesn't go 
in for the paint and sparkle the 
Allyn's do and apparently the market is not saturated, rather a 
shortage of willing workers. 
So they have to 
import cheaper 
Italian or German pine cones, etc.! 
Hazel notes also tendency 
for traditional customers to stay will them, some since they 
began in 
1946 (others have died, gone out of business, etc.) 
Leo told story: some years ago a shipment of light brown 
Italian cattails came in and people were predicting that would be 
the end of his business (a sidewise comment on my report that the 
Allyn's were pessimistic about the business in future). 
Didn't 
turn out that way, he says, as nowadays everybody wants the dark 
brown native cattails. 
There's an art to cutting the cattails; use a sickle, but 
don't swing it. 
Rather grab a bunch, then cut, estimating proper 
length. 
Leo claims to be able to cut 5 bundles in time it takes 
a piece work cutter to cut one, and he doesn't trust such workers 
to do 
it right anyway. 
Further complaints about Pinelands Commission: referring to 
the Green Acres (program or company??), on road out of Winslow 
toward Black Horse Pike, to Piney Hollow. 
A friend had a 
blueberry patch out there, but Green Acres wanted it so forced 
him to sell, an at their price. 
His friend grew holly for 
nurseries between the rows of blueberries. 
Now it's just sitting 
there, doing nothing. 
By contrast the CC camps were good, the 
people earned their dollar. 
Even during the war he would run 
into CC guys who'd been at the Green Bank camp. 
They built Lake 
Oswego and Absegami. 
Those that built Lake Oswego were "all 
colored." 
There were 200 men at each (2?) camp. 
They worked for 
their bunk, not like today. 
Hazel on 
importance of timing 
in cutting: some now (as noted 
above), some 
in August, some after first frosts; some need to be 
cured properly to bring out colors, etc, such as dock, others 
need to be cured "by God," e.g., fern seed (sensitive fern, 
Onoclea), to bring out best color.

Left Landy's after lunch, ca 1:15 PM. 
Drove east to Wading 
River, north to Harrisville ruin, then back, surveying the 
country. 
(Also, Leo sometimes uses boat to get to otherwise 
inaccessible cattails.) 
AT Pleasant Mills: Vaccinium atrococcum,

Lots of fishermen, black and white 
on Wading River bridge. 
One young black man who came up with his 
fishing pole just after I arrived, commented on the beauty of the 
view, fact that it might not last given the pace of building/ 
development. 
Narrowleaf cattails here (collected). 
Spartina 
cynosuroides (to 8 feet high) here also, but last years stalks: 
no sign of this years growth. 
Exotic trees at Harrisville ruin: red mulberry, catalpa, 
etc. 
Blue—gray Gnatcatchers here, the only place. 
Found 
Vaccinium vacillans here. 
Lots of gypsy moths in oak forest just 
south of the Wading River bridge on the Chatsworth road. 
Some 
trees nearly defoliated (photos). 
Birds varied however including 
a Scarlet Tanager. 
Undergrowth of Gaylussacia frondosa,

Tom 
fe; noted deer seen nearby recently. 
I borrowed a wooden handled sickle and joined Leo cutting at 
a spot a quarter mile down the road from Tom's site. 
Leo joked 
that Tom was 'hoggin' the cattails" there, didn't want us cutting 
in; 
apparently with no hostility intended. 
We cut here from 8:30 
until about 11:30 within 100 yards of the road. 
I cut two

Tom Suddard (last name uncertain). 
Tom has been doing 
it 
for 20 years (he appears to be about 35-40 years old, missing 
only three seasons in that time, though he's been 
in the service 
and to college. The work 
is highly seasonal, lasting about three 
weeks in June, just like the strawberry season, as both Tom and 
Leo remarked. 
He clearly does it 
in 
large part for the pleasure 
of working outdoors without a boss (though Leo is technically his 
employer, paying not only piece work but a bit more for Tom's 
help 
in hauling and preparing the materials). 
Their relationship 
seems very congenial, based on mutual respect. 
Tom refers to 
Hazel 
as "Aunt." 
Hunn--84 Fieldnotes 
page 75 
Vegetation with narrow—leaved cat (the only species out in 
these (brackish?) tide flats--the broad—leaved species in fresh 
water only and with a leaf as broad as the Phragmites, ca. 1 inch 
wide): Phragmites communis, which Landy calls "cut grass" because 
its razor—edged leaves--on growing culms at this season 5-7 feet 
high but without fresh flower plumes, though some remain from 
last year--cut your hands as you reach for the cattails. 
I can 
attest to that myself through participant observation and about a 
dozen minor lacerations on my hands. 
Landy seems not quite sure 
that "cut grass" 
is the same as what he sells as "plume grass" 
and "fluffy plume" which he harvests for their plume like 
infloresences in the fall. (This grass 
is commonly called "fox 
tail" by Delaware Bay people such as George Thompson, Sr., or 
also "phragmites": EH) 
Leo didn't think "cut grass" was invading 
the meadows as he recalls it being here when he first started 
(ca. 
1946) the business, but he does think the "plume" 
is 
invading. 
Also growing here 
is "three square" (Scirpus olneyi 
and or S. americana) and a smaller version of what he markets as 
"nut grass" (Juncus gerardi, which 
is the "black grass" of the 
salt hay business; he may market Juncus dichotomous?); 
also 
present are last year's culms and scattered dried inflorescences 
of Spartina cynosuroides, 6-8 feet tall 
or more, which he markets 
as "sea grass." 
"Salt hay" also present, but no flowers yet (no 
doubt Spartina patens or some such). 
Dominant birds here are marsh wrens (abundant) and red— 
winged blackbirds. 
We found two nests (wren or blackbird) which 
Leo identified as blackbird nests (though he wasn't sure what the 
wren's nest looked like). 
He carefully cuts around these nests, 
even though he believes they have already fledged this years crop 
of young. 
Leo says you can tell this years nests from last 
year's by the color. 
Lots of fiddler crabs (photo); "mushrat 
holes" identified as a danger underfoot. 
A good cutter can cut 2000/hour. 
Tom commented on relative 
weight of his bundles (heavier) and Leo's, as he helped me carry 
Leo's to the truck (I suspect Leo, at 71 years of age, relies on 
Tom for this part of the job). 
The trick to hauling bundles out 
is 
to 
load them up butt end back and right straight over ones 
head (photo of Tom illustrating this technique); also stay on the 
salt hay en route back to avoid the worst of the mushrat holes 
and ditches--though the going was still 
rather rough. 
Tide has 
been way out and bugs not at all 
bad. 
Few mosquitos and a few 
more "green—headed flies" (deer flies?). 
Leo says the "gnats" 
(biting, blood suckers, perhaps black flies) are the worst, but 
none out today. 
A nice breeze and a bit cool, at least early on 
Leo also mentioned black flies, but without details. 
Preferred technique 
is 
to cut 5-6 at a time, using the 
sickle to hook the ones desired; then slide the blade down the 
stalks to the desired length (I was cutting them too long; 
they'll be cut to proper length back at the green house anyway, 
but it goes quicker and one hauls less weight if they're cut 
Hunn--84 Fieldnotes 
page 76 
right from the beginning). 
This 
is rather tricky, as the 
fruiting cattails are mixed with sterile plants. 
Leo suspects 
they are "two—year plants" (i.e., requiring two years to mature) 
though he claims never to have read such 
in any botanical book. 
Also mixed 
in are "cut grass" stalks. 
Though the cutting goes 
quickest where the cattails are pure and dense, Leo likes to 
clean up an area, cutting any strays missed or scattered. 
One 
can feel the tension on the cattail grasped by the left hand, and 
the sickle may cut only (or primarily) the fronds selected. 
Leo 
identified the top segment of the infloresence as "male," which 
is botanically correct and distinctive of the narrow—leaved cat 
(The broad—leaved cattail has male segment of the infloresence 
directly above the female, rather than separated by a section of 
stalk, as here). 
The finished cattail product has this male 
segment broken off and the basal 
leaves stripped. 
Different sized and different colored (for example, we found 
a population with yellower infloresences and subtly different 
leaves--which I could not perceive--which Leo considered worth 
investigating for future marketing as a distinct type). 
Leo says 
the "minis" and other size categories represent distinct 
populations growing at distinct localities rather than 
differences in maturity (as I had assumed), as cattails of 
whatever size must be harvested at precisely the right time; thus 
the brief, 
intense season. 
Working here within 200 yards of the road; probably the 
normal maximal distance they go from a road to cut the cattails, 
though may go further with a boat--a technique sometimes 
employed, but which I did not witness. 
Independents bring in 
loads, 
if no good, Leo just won't buy 
it: 
"see what else they can do with it," Leo commented. 
From top of 
truck bed here we can see the bridge across to New Gretna and 
also a tower up the Wading River. 
Traffic on the bridge heard 
here as a dull 
rumble. 
Leo self—taught, by "trial and error," 
not apprenticed as Tom has been to him. 
Leo started out working 
for the man he refers to as "the botanist," who established the 
company Leo and Hazel now own, cutting flowers such as laurel, 
azalea, sweet bay, rhododendron, etc. 
Nowadays people get after 
you 
if you tried to cut them (I think I understood his meaning 
here), so he doesn't do that anymore. 
"the botanist" apparently 
was not a field man, so Leo learned by trial and error where and 
how to harvest such plants as cattail. 
It 
is obvious that to be 
successful at this you must have an 
intimate knowledge of not 
just the plants and their harvest schedules and habitats, but 
also of the places, the bark roads, the land owners, the other 
people out there working the woods or the bay. 
Theft a bit of a problem in their perception. 
I believe Tom 
remarked that he made his bundles big enough so nobody could 
easily haul them away if he was away from the truck for a time. 
"Hogging it" seems two edged term; Tom was hogging it this 
morning, getting an early, vigorous start because of the tide, 
in 
Hunn--84 Fieldnotes 
page 77 
a positive sense of being an aggressive worker; but Tom was 
hogging the cattails at his preferred cutting spot, suggesting 
that he was being exclusive, possessive, perhaps with a hint of 
approbation. 
Leo also commented on three guys encountered out 
cutting cattails one day who abandoned there area (though plenty 
of cattails still there to come over and cut near them (these men 
from Chatsworth): apparently they were hogging Leo's cattails. 
Two turtles encountered on road back (photos): a diamondback 
in 
the road at the marsh edge and a box turtle on the asphalt 
road, another of the same squashed. 
Salt hay not harvested in 
this area as marsh has to be just right, ground solid to allow 
use of heavy equipment for cutting and hauling, too much work for 
most people, though strawberry growers use 
it, getting it from 
Delaware Bay salt hay farmers. 
Lower Bank road bridge closed for 
maintenance: typical of government, according to Leo, to wait 
until summer's heavy traffic to do maintenance work. 
Cattail cutting procedure: have sickle, sharpened at start of 
season only but will touch it up soon, as sickle, 
like an axe, 
will hold an edge 
if sharpened properly. 
Then baling twine; Leo 
has a large box 
in the cab of his truck and cuts an appropriate 
length before going out to cut (to avoid unnecessary extra trips: 
which I had to make as he had not figured my two bales in). 
A 
loop tied 
in one end, the twine laid out flat, then bundles 
brought into central 
location from where cut, picked up--clean 
out sterile shoots, etc., turn tops all 
one way--and tamped even 
on butt end. 
This repeated 3-4 times until full bundle laid out. 
This then cinched up and tied. 
The the whole bundle lifted, 
tamped and laid back down. 
Leo likes to finish a bundle, then 
sit down on 
it and have a cigarette. 
No trouble selling all 
he 
can cut, as orders come 
in all year. 
Only a few people insist on 
this years cattails, so they keep. 
After an area is cut over or 
enough has been cut, 
all 
the bundles are hauled back to the road 
and dumped 
in the truck bed. 
A water bottle at the truck for 
refreshment, though a few hours or a half day 
is usually enough 
as 
it takes at least as much time to clean and set out for drying 
the cattails, as 
it does to cut them, maybe a bit more. 
Lunch with the Landy's, talk mostly of the dump issue, as 
noted above. 
Hazel expressed concern that we not published 
photos of their drying operation in any book we might publish; 
trade secrets. 
Both noted that Joe Mick, now about 81, of 
Jenkins Neck, 
is an "honest" supplier of pine cones; Hazel visits 
him now and again as a cataract has left him blind 
in one eye. 
She 
is solicitous of him; thinks he needs help finding adequate 
medical assistance for an operation--they didn't use the term 
"piney," but I suspect he would typify most locals definition of 
same. 
Joe Mick always kept his pine cone supply carefully locked 
behind two doors! 
Leo once asked him why and he said if he 
didn't somebody steal them for sure.

"black grass" a kind of salt 
hay, 
identified by Leo Landy as "salt hay" and a relative of the 
"nut grass" he markets, and identified next day by George 
Thompson, Sr., as "black grass," one of three salt hay species, 
the others being "yellow hay" (presumably Spartina patens) and 
"rosemary" (presumably Distichlis spicata). 
#1671 (two sets) Scirpus olneyi. 
"three square": identified here 
by Leo Landy and later by Tom Brown as the same, a species Tom 
Brown says 
is preferred duck food. 
Wildlife people spray salt 
meadows to kill Phragmites and cattail (good for muskrats) to 
encourage growth of three square for duck hunters, which drives 
out the muskrats. 
Leo's cattail spot is private property, part of a large 
property of a man whose name I didn't catch. 
The federal govern— 
ment had leased it to build a communications installation, ruins 
of which are still apparent. 
Leo refers to this as "government 
pollution," being highly critical of how the government came in, 
built, then left it all 
to rot 
in the marsh. 
Tom lives 
in 
Sweetwater. 
Phone conversation with Tom Brown to arrange interview for 
Thursday, 21 June. 
He commented on cattails: 
you can almost 
subsist off them, grind up the roots for flour, use the fluff for 
pillow stuffing; primary resource for muskrats, food and shelter. 
Plants collected on 18 June: 
identified: Thalictrum polygamum, a 
rather showy flower growing at Wading River bridge; Stone notes, 
"one of the old friends we find again in 
rich swamps where 
interior country meets the great salt meadows of the coast." 
Exactly. 
Smilax and Vitis specimens indeterminate. 
Scirpus 
olneyi (mine) and S. americana apparently quite similar, the 
latter perhaps more common and noted by Stone as "three square." 
I suspect the name "three square" applies indifferently to both. 
Northern Diamondback Terrapin is Malaclemys terrapin; 
Eastern Box Turtle is Terrapene carolina. 
Common weedy milkweed is apparently Asclepias syriaca. 
Carex albolutescens, Juncus dichotomous two plants found growing 
at a pond edge near Hammonton. 
On my way to the SWAC meeting I stopped at the Amatol site 
to 
look around (photos). 
It had been described in the con— 
sultants report as "highly disturbed." 
It 
is bisected by occa— 
sional sand roads running north from Rte. 561 which appear little 
used and the area appears to have been logged within the past 20 
years, maybe less, though some impressively large trees remain

page 79 
scattered about. 
Though it was a hot late afternoon, many birds 
were evident. 
In fact I recorded 6 singing warbler species and 
got a fine look at a Yellow—billed Cuckoo. 
The place had as 
great a diversity of oaks (7-8 species) as I've seen anywhere. 
The consultants report also noted that an endangered species was 
on the site, but did not identify the species. 
Interestingly, 
none of the opponents nor their literature attacked the choice of 
Amato) on the grounds that it 
is 
an ecologically valuable site, 
though it seems to me such a claim might well 
be made. 
Its 
botanical and ornithological diversity is 
in part due to 
its 
disturbed condition, but the disturbance is not aesthetically 
unpleasant, on the contrary. 
Though it 
is noted as of historic 
value: a blue marker on the road tells the story (photo), there 
is 
little evidence of that historic use, at least to my quick 
reconnaissance.

No one had posted any notice of this

The organizers of the meeting might well 
be accused of 
trying to minimize the crowd by this unannounced change of 
location. 
Some 200+ people were in attendance, I suspect all 
opposed, judging by the audience responses (see AEHO15l016), with 
ca. 24 people sitting on the stage, representing the 15+ members 
of the SWAC, several representatives of the consulting firm of ?, 
Golden, and Halpern, the committee chair (who was valiantly 
trying to suppress his impatience at the opposition), and an 
official stenographer recording the proceedings.

TXOI: Event #1: hiked the Batona Trail from Batsto to near Quaker 
Bridge and back, 7:30—Noon. 
Event #2: 
photographed salt hay harvesting 
operations of George Campbell, Sr., and family, at Delford and 
Heislerville. 
Birds noted along the trail and at Batsto: Bobwhite, 
Laughing Gull, Mourning Dove, Yellow—billed Cuckoo, Chimney 
Swift, Common Flicker, Hairy or Downy Woodpecker, young 
in nest, 
Great Crested Flycatcher, Eastern Wood Pewee, Purple Martin, Blue 
Jay, Fish Crow, Carolina Chickadee, House Wren, Robin, Gray 
Catbird, Brown Thrasher, Cedar Waxwing, Blue—winged Warbler, Pine 
Warbler, Prairie Warbler, Black—and—White Warbler, Ovenbird 
feeding young, Common Yellowthroat, Scarlet Tanager, and Rufous— 
sided Towhee. 
Also noted Eastern Box Turtle, Eastern Gray 
Squirrel, Peromyscus ►eucopus, Eastern Cottontail, and raccoon on 
the trail. 
And no people! 
Heard one vehicle on the adjacent 
sand road on one occasion only. 
Nor were there any fresh human 
tracks on the trail 
(since the rains of two days past) but lots 
of deer, etc., tracks. 
Plants of special note were Gaylussacia 
dumosa (grouseberry) along the shore of Batsto Lake, 
in flower 
(collected). 
The bugs were moderate, mostly the bothersome "pine 
fly" (a species of deer fly with black patterned wings. 
I began by hiking a poorly maintained side trail which 
follows the shore of Batsto Lake, eventually crossing a sand road 
from Batsto, which in turn crosses the Batona Trail as 
it comes 
down to the Batsto River from the fire tower (see the Batona 
Trail guide in the 
incidental file). 
The stretch of trail along 
the lake shore reminded me strongly of hikes I've enjoyed in the 
Cascade Mountains of western Washington state, especially the 
think Vaccinium brush and the cedar margined lake (it would be 
fir and hemlock out west). 
It was cool 
and damp with dew. 
But 
shortly I left the lake shore and entered the now warm and dry 
oak—pine woodland: I was transported to oak—pine belt of south— 
eastern Arizona's "Mexican mountains," a favorite habitat con— 
figuration for the dedicated birder. 
White sandy flats

area sported flowering Pine Barrens Sandwort (Arenaria carolinia 
na) 
in conjunction with past—flowering "heather" (Hudsonia). 
The 
Batona Trail 
is marked with pink blazes on the trees and 
is broad 
and easy to follow. 
The trail passes close by one or two sub— 
stantial cedar swamp as 
it margins Batsto River. 
At one such 
border zone I had six warbler species singing at once, but found 
virtually no birds actually within the swamp itself. 
The river 
is strongly tea colored and icy/refreshing on a hot midday. 
Where side creeks come down to the Batsto (one such named Goodwater 
Run--the end of the line for my trek this morning) they are 
bordered by swamp maple (Acer rubrum) and black gum (Nyssa 
sylvatica) and harbor catbirds. 
The dominant oaks along this stretch are shrubby Blackjack 
Oak and tree—sized Post Oaks. 
Undergrowth includes lots of 
Gaylussacia frondosa, some still 
in flower, Gaylussacia baccata, 
with green fruits, Vaccinium corymbosum with a few ripe fruits 
along the lake shore, and Vaccinium vacillans. 
Photographed 
Azalea viscosa. 
Lyonia mariana--staggerbush--more conspicuous 
than Lyonia ligustrina--maleberry. 
At the river's edge 
is 
Clethra alnifolia and Ilex glabra. 
Kalmia angustifolia. 
Quiet most impressive here. 
More on habitat contrasts: 
maple—gum swamp 
in hot muggy weather almost Amazonian, tropical; 
cedar bogs reminiscent of boreal Alaska black spruce bogs. 
Thus 
north, south, northwest and southwest all represented here. 
Ovenbirds very conspicuous, feeding young along the trail. 
Noted a possible blackjack X black oak hybrid. 
En route to Heislerville: found a painted turtle in the road 
near Elwood, photographed. 
Thompson Beach Road salt hay baling operation. 
I arrived at 
2 PM as per schedule to find one worker, a young man named Scott, 
just returning from the meadow driving the John Deere tractor. 
He had just finished turning the hay that had been cut two—three 
days before. 
Turning is necessary--using a rotating rake type 
tractor attachment--if it rains on the cut hay, otherwise it 
is 
not. 
Shortly Stuart Campbell, one of George Sr.'s two sons, 
drove up. 
We talked while we waited for George Sr. to arrive 
with the second hand, a prison farm work release from Leesburg 
State Prison Farm. 
Stuart explained about the business. 
Salt 
hay 
is used by strawberry farmers, especially the Chinese 
in 
Freehold and nearby areas, chopped after curing, used as mulch. 
Salt hay shipped to Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, west 
Jersey (mostly to these Chinese strawberry farmers), even 
Maryland. 
Nobody doing salt hay harvesting on the Delaware side 
anymore, as far as he knows. 
They use no pesticides: only pest 
of the crop is something called an "army worm," but Stuart has 
never seen it as there hasn't been a recent infestation. 
Stuart went to college, then started a real estate, sub— 
Hunn--84 Fieldnotes 
page 83 
division business, building maybe 25 homes a year, but the 
Pinelands Commission/regulations have put them out of business. 
So he's returned to the family salt hay operation. 
The operation 
employs five people, George, Sr., George Jr.--who's currently 
cutting hay on other meadows south of Eldora (photographed later 
that day)--Stuart, and two hands, Scott, and the work release 
inmate, a black guy from Philadelphia doing 13 years for bank 
robbery. 
This man can't stand bugs; wears heavy clothing no 
matter how hot it gets, 
including a wool cap pulled down over his 
ears. 
Says he'd rather be 
in Philly where the smog has killed 
everything but human beings! 
Salt hay work begins in mid—June with the first cutting, 
including a lot of "black grass" (Juncos gerardi), which 
cure as well 
as the "yellow hay" (Spartina patens). 
It c

Cutting continues

w not otherwise accessible, especially tidal 
soft substrate. 
When frozen you can cut it on 
Then there's little work until end of May 
ikes, etc.). 
They also do not work on Sundays 
It takes 2-3 days after a rain for the fields 
to dry out enough for cutting. 
Thus salt hay farmers benefit 
from droughts that harm upland farmers. 
A guy named Johnson 
still cuts hay on the Mullica, as do two Barry's at Cedarville 
and Coombsa. 
All 
these other salt hay operations depend on tidal 
marshes rather than diked marshes, which limits the time the hay 
can be harvested. 
The Campbell's operation is 80-90% on diked 
meadows and a much larger operation than that of the others. 
After three years at $3.50 a bale they've raised their price 
this year to $4.50. 
They also have a fresh hay operation, 
selling fresh hay at $2.00 "out of the field," but $2.50 if 
it 
has to be stored. 
Fresh hay 
is either alfalfa or mixed orchard 
grass (Dactylis glomerata) and timothy (Phleum pratense). 
Sometimes mixed with clover. 
I photographed their hay sign out 
on Rte. 47 and one of their fresh hay fields with orchard grass 
and timothy mixed. 
Salt hay 
is heavier than fresh hay per bale. 
Salt hay remains the mainstay of their operation as it's a 
special commodity. 
So far they've been able to sell 
all the salt 
hay they can cut. 
Tools used 
in the operation include a baler (photographed in 
action) which is towed behind the tractor and which rakes up the 
dried hay and bales it, pushing the wired bales up a ramp behind 
where the two hands, using baling hooks, reach out and haul 
the 
bale onto the bed of the wagon, towed behind the baler. 
As the 
bales come out they are stacked in a special pattern so that the 
fork lift back at the road can pick up ten bales at once, 
transfering them to the special flat—bed trailer. 
This trailer 
can hold 420 bales and has a specially constructed (by Ezra Cox, 
who's good at that sort of mechanical 
invention) so that the 
Hunn--84 Fieldnotes 
page 84 
bales can be pushed off the end by a sliding metal frame that 
forms the front end of the flat—bed trailer (photos). 
A second 
tractor is operated by George Jr. and pulls the mower (photos). 
This familial division of 
labor is traditional (George Sr. runs 
the baling operation, Stuart does transport, etc., George Jr. 
mows, the hands help stack the bales). 
Hands are paid $4-5/hr. 
Black grass not usually intermingled with yellow hay, but 
rather predominates in certain areas, so can be cut earlier if 
desired. 
It's cut first as 
it doesn't cure well; 
it 
is not sent 
to the (discriminating) Chinese strawberry farmers as 
it jams 
their chopping machines. 
Other customers (e.g., cement workers) 
don't care which kind the get, even some with Phragmites mixed in 
(Phragmites also called locally "foxtail. ") 
Best salt hay 
is 
laid over, 
indicating a thick, tall growth. 
If too thin, they'll 
leave 
it until a second year. 
I asked about problem of cutting up birds nests, especially 
ducks. 
Stuart said they rarely have a problem with that as the 
ducks are hatched and gone by mid June or else nest elsewhere. 
Stuart is about 28-29 years old. 
At about 3:00 George Sr. arrived with the work release 
inmate, angry at having been made to wait 45 minutes at the 
prison (not clear if the fault of prison officials or of the 
inmate not being ready). 
Apparently it 
is not easy to get 
workers, though George and Stuart seemed to approve of the worker 
release program, delays excepted. 
The advantage of using such a 
source of labor is that he needn't employ the man every day, only 
when needed, day by day. 
Bill Lee, now living with his daughter and son—in—law in 
Millville, 
is an old time snapperer who'd be happy to talk to us 
about, even if he's not doing 
it now. 
Suggested we look him up 
(see FEHO621). 
Eelers did well this year. 
Scott is an agriculture student at a college in New York 
state. 
The convict is a writer and disclaims any desire to go 
into farming as a result of his work experience here. 
He says he 
will have a book published by Princeton Seminary press on the 
topic of "negation." 
He's apparently been pursuing a course of 
study while in prison (13 years so far, soon to be released) 
through the Princeton seminary. 
He's intelligent and articulate, 
even 
if alienated to bugs and rural 
life. 
The wagon 
is stacked 3 rows high and will hold about 50 at 
that height. 
The small field we baled this afternoon yielded 
about 40 bales, each weighing about 75 pounds. 
Each bale 
is 
clearly a substantial 
load for the hands to handle. 
The baling 
operation went smoothly and took less than an hour, with a couple 
of brief stops for George Sr. to adjust the height of the rakes. 
Grackles moved in to feed after the baler passed. 
I noticed that 
a variety of plants get mixed together in baling, including 
Hunn--84 Fieldnotes 
page 85 
Spartina patens, Juncus gerardi, bits and pieces of Phragmites, a 
carex, Distichlis ("rosemary"), etc., but it's predominantly 
Spartina here. 
Mosquito stories entertained us while waiting. 
Salt marsh 
mosquito hatches in great quantities a short while after an area 
has been flooded by a break 
in the dike with poor subsequent 
drainage. 
The eggs may have lain dormant for years until this 
happens. 
On one occasion George Sr. recalls walking across the 
meadow just after a big hatch when the mosquitos all hovered 
about a foot above the ground so thick you couldn't seen your 
feet! 
If they rise 
it you just have to give up and go home. 
Stuart reports that they ship about 100 truck loads, at 420 
bales per, each year, which at this year's price should produce 
about $200,000 gross income. 
Stuart reports an 
income of ca. 
$15,000 per year for each of the three families involved, enough 
to pay the bills but not enough to "get ahead" or to "build 
anything." 
No profit in the salt hay business, usually runs at a 
loss, but pays the bills. 
Only really profitable business he's 
been involved with is real estate. 
Birds conspicuous during the operation: Red-winged 
Blackbirds on the edges of the fields, Laughing Gulls passing 
overhead, also lots of Glossy Ibis, an Eastern Kingbird, Snowy 
Egrets, Green-backed Heron over, yellowthroats, grackles, 
catbird. 
I then went back to Eldora to photograph the cutting 
operation of George Jr. 
Green-headed flies vicious, but not so 
much 
in the closed cab of his tractor. 
George Jr. considered the 
hay growth this year to be stunted and he thought that the large 
flock of gulls following the mower might be feeding on something 
like the "army worm" that sometimes infests the fields. 
I also 
noted grackles, red-winged blackbirds, and cattle egrets in the 
fields, attracted by the mowing, and heard eastern meadowlarks, 
etc. 
All three main kinds of salt hay clearly evident in this 
field (as indicated by the different colors: dark green for 
"black grass" (Juncus gerardi), gray green for "rosemary" 
(Distichlis spicata), and bright gold green for "yellow hay" 
(Spartina patens). 
The combined effect is quite beautiful. 
No narrow-leaved cattails seen down here. 
In fact, George 
Sr. considered cattails to be excluded by salt water, thus 
cattails pose no problems for the salt hay operation, unlike the 
Phragmites which does seem able to tolerate salt. 
(Actually, the 
narrow-leaved cattails on the Mullica are in FRESH water, but in 
an area affected by the tides, an 
interesting situation.) 
George 
Sr. also did not seem to know the name "three square" for Scirpus 
americana/S. olneyi, a "grass" Tom Brown discussed as being prime 
duck food and 
in competition with cattails, though I suspect 
these may constitute the "sedge" fields GC Sr. pointed out to me 
beyond his dikes last March.

TX01: Event #1:Visit and environment tour with Tom Brown, 
Millville, NJ, trapper, and Muriel Brown, his wife (see AEHO09). 
Nine AM to ca. 3PM. 
Drove east on Rte. 47 and side roads to 
Corbin City marshes where Tom sets for muskrats. 
Visited his 
cousin's cedar log cabin home (newly constructed) 
in Estelle 
Manor, then returned to the oak woodland near his house where he 
sets traps for fox. 
After lunch Tom took me to Bill Lee's house 
and we discussed snappering and fishing with Bill Lee until about 
4 PM. 
Tom then had to 
leave. 
Event #2 Visit with Bill Lee, 81 year old fisherman, 
snapperer, and general bay person (see AEHO10). 
Bill and his 
wife Josephine live 
in a trailer on their property on Moore's 
Beach Rd. (east side) just south of Delmont, Maurice River TWP, 
Cumberland Co. (#38). 
However, after several 
incidents of 
vandalism/theft from their trailer, Bill and Josephine have moved 
in with Bill's daughter and her husband, Milton C. Corson, 300 
Union Lake Rd., Millville. 
Bill commutes twice daily, every day, 
to check his gill net set up just off Moore's Beach, where the 
wrecked trailer is on the dunes. 
Since they won't let him go out 
in a boat (according to John Bailey, the fish buyer in Port 
Elizabeth--see FEH0624--for his own safety, as he's got a bad 
heart and 
is getting along in years), he wades (using hip boots) 
out to his net at low tide, day and night. 
His father/Bill 
himself used to own most of the land on the east side of Moore's 
Beach Rd., but he's sold most of 
it off, some to a cousin, 
keeping only the land on which his trailer now sits. 
Before beginning the tape (AEHO10) Bill discussed the 
destruction of the Delaware fisheries with Tom Brown and myself. 
He described the annual migration of the vast school of striped 
bass (called "rock" locally) from Cape Cod down to past Hatteras. 
In spring migration they would come into the Bay 
in vast numbers. 
But last time 
it happened (year?) 
local officials wouldn't let 
local fishermen touch them. 
This was a big school that took 50-
100 years to build up to 
its size at that time. 
So (for some 
reason) the "rock" moved offshore (beyond the then effective 12 
mile offshore limit) and the Russians got them all. 
Hunn--84 Fieldnotes 
page 87 
Bill talked of "bunkers" (menhaden). 
He used to catch 50 
bushels a day, 50-60 fish per bushel, got $1.25 per bushel. 
Caught with 4" mesh (pronounced "mash") net. 
Until about 1930 
from the turn of the century. 
When he would catch a weakfish 
there might be 40-50 little bunkers 
in 
its stomach. 
So bunkers 
the key element in the food chain (my term:EH) supporting the 
entire local fishery. 
Bunkers spawned/hatched in the marshes 
along the Delaware Bay shore. 
Little (2-3") bunkers would be 
there by the trillions. 
Then the Cape May County Mosquito 
Commission, on the basis of aerial photographs, decided these 
millions of bunkers they could see on the photographs were 
mosquitos! 
They sprayed and killed them all off. 
Sprayed a 
powder, 
like lime, that took the oxygen out of the water. 
Destroyed the fishery, put many out of work, all 
in one year. 
Bill 
later (FEH0624) described seeing these fish by the trillions 
alive one day, all 
dead, floating on the water, that night, after 
a spraying. 
Bill 
loves to talk about his fishing experiences. 
I 
arranged to return Sunday morning (24 June 1984), to meet him at 
Moore's Beach just before low water (11 AM, 
low water 12—IPM) to 
photograph him checking his net for weakfish (and a few bunkers). 
He sells all 
his fish to Bailey's in Port Elizabeth (see also 
FEH0624 for interview with John Bailey, proprietor). 
Bill Lee's 
full name 
is William Charles Lee, Charles being his mother's 
dad's name, but his father neglected to 
list it on the birth 
certificate, so he's officially just William Lee, William being 
also his father's name. 
During winter he traps mushrats, claims 
to have taken 1000 a year for 50 years out of 
local marshes. 
Could take 2000 a year teamed with his wife. 
Striped bass used to occur in migration by the millions in 
February or March, "thick as bunkers." 
No longer (see above for 
reason). 
Yesterday he caught 66 pounds of weakfish plus 10 
pounds of bunkers; weakfish sold for 80 cents/pound, but now for 
only 35 cents. 
Tides are critical for a fisherman. 
There's the 
"pe'rigee" and the "po'gee" (both "g"'s "soft) (derived from 
perigee and apogee); there's a perigee first and last of July, 
that's when the tides come up high and fast, go out likewise; 
"pogee" tides come up slow and not high, etc. 
He has 3 nets set 
just off Moore's Beach, 80 fathoms long, raised off the bottom to 
let the "king crabs" (i.e., horseshoe crabs) pass under, they're 
there by the thousands, attracting gulls likewise. 
Bill jokes 
that his only boat now 
is a washtub (the washtub he keeps his 
nets 
in 
in the back of his pickup/keeps his fish when he's got 
lots). 
I told him about seeing 15 pelicans off Reed's Beach and 
he was sure I had confused them with ibis (as 
in fact that's what 
I first thought they were: pelicans are very rare this far north, 
and only 
in the past three years have they been seen regularly at 
Cape May), as he'd never seen them before here. 
EVENT #l: 
I arrived at Tom & Muriel Brown's house (east of 
Hunn--84 Fieldnotes 
page 88 
Millville just south of Rte. 49) at 9 AM. 
After breakfast Tom 
and I drove in his pickup eat on 49 to Head of the River (the 
Tuckahoe River, that is), thence down on the north side of the 
river to Corbin City, then out into the marshes between the 
Tuckahoe and the Great Egg Harbor estuaries. 
We then visited his 
cousin's place in Estelle Manor, just off Rte. 557; a recently 
constructed, owner built cedar log cabin and talked there with 
his cousin's wife. 
She has a nice native shrub garden in her 
front yard, including flowering native prickly pear. 
We returned 
on Rte. 49, but toured the Atlantic Power and Light property--and 
site of a now defunct sand mining operation--and quarry ponds, 
also oak woodland where he sets traps for fox, right behind his 
house. 
A large tract originally planned for a coal fired plant, 
but Tom hopes it'll never be built, as 
it would literally be 
in 
his own back yard. 
The quarry ponds now support record sized 
bass, and are favored by 
local fishermen; they are on state land. 
After sharing lunch, Tom took me 
into town to 
introduce me to 
Bill Lee, and old friend and fellow mushrat trapper. 
The three 
of us visited at Bill Lee's daughter's home 
in Millville for 
nearly an hour--Bill Lee 
is even more of a talker than Tom!--
until Tom had to go. 
The following is from hand written notes taken during the 
tour. 
Identifications of plants, etc., by Tom. 
"Blackberry" for 
Rubus cf. cuneifolius, berries edible. 
Great and Snowy Egrets 
common in the fresh water empoundments on the Corbin City 
marshes; he called them "ay'rets," large and small, and described 
how he'd watched the large one catch an eel. 
Contrasted with 
"blue heron." 
Used to eat eel; Tom's cousin still does, but Tom 
doesn't like to eat them, ever since he ate some (cooked) that 
had gotten cold. 
They tasted raw. 
It didn't seem right for 
something that was cooked to turn raw like that. 
"Pokeweed" seen 
in flower (but not collected: Phytolacca decandra, EH); Tom eats 
greens in spring. 
Elderberry (Sambucus canadensis, EH, though 
Tom misidentified Viburnum dentatum as this), used to make wine. 
On muskrat trapping: Lester Lee feels for muskrat runs 
in 
winter with his feet, sets conibear traps. (Conibear traps 
normally not useful 
in tidal areas.) 
"Pin oak" for an example of 
Quercus falcata (EH) growing on the dikes, though normally, I 
believe, Tom applies "pin oak" to Quercus coccinea. 
We visited 
Griosman Landing where ammunition was loaded onto barges during 
the war (WWI?) for shipment overseas. 
Just ruins left now of the 
settlement. 
"Wild cherry" for Prunus serotina (EH), fruit good 
to eat. 
I asked Tom for the name of an example of Quercus 
phellos growing on the marsh dike. 
He said he didn't know what 
it was called. 
Both Q. phellos and Q. falcata are scarce within 
the boundaries of the Pinelands, though quite common on the 
fringes. 
Tom seems otherwise well versed on the distinctions 
among the eight Pinelands oaks. 
A catbird called "catbird." 
Ditto "red—winged blackbird." 
Ditto "marsh wren." 
"I 
like 
them," he noted. 
On the passage of time and the absorption of 
Hunn--84 Fieldnotes 
page 89 
Grisman Landing by the forest: 
people hauled off the old stones 
for their yards; "65-70 years and nature takes it back." 
On 
collecting wild upland blueberries: 
it was hard work; you got $1 
per bucket and might collect 2 buckets in a long day. 
Swamp 
forest vegetation: "gum" (Nyssa sylvatica, EH), magnolia 
(Magnolia virginiana, EH), "holly" (Ilex opaca, EH), mostly 
"maple" (Acer rubrum, EH). 
On pines: "bull pine" (apparently 
Pinus rigida, EH), good for box boards, not good for lumber as 
the "smooth bark pine" (P. echinata apparently, EH) because has 
more limbs, 
is 
"too limby." 
Distinguished by rougher bark and 
more limby trunk from "smoothbark pine." 
Tom knows because he 
used to work 
in a sawmill when he was ca 14 years old). 
"Spruce 
pine" (apparently Pinus virginiana, EH) also has good lumber, 
if 
you can find any without too many limbs. 
He identified a nice 
large P. virginiana as such and noted how "limby" 
it was. 
"Swamp 
cedar" 
is Chamaecyparis thyoides (EH), versus "upland cedar" 
(Juniperus virginiana, EH). 
You can tell the gum (Nyssa 
sylvatica) by 
its bark. 
People still collect "laurel" (Kalmia 
latifolia) foliage in the winter for the florist market. 
We crossed the remains of Honest John Road, an old stage 
coach road from Mays Landing down through Belcoville and Corbin 
City. 
We then passed a "feed patch" created by the state, 
bulldozed to clear the ground, then sewed with "rye"I"ryegrass" 
(Tom seemed to use the two names synonymously) for the deer. 
"Hog huckleberry" (Gaylussacia baccata?, EH), 
low growing, seedy, 
may eat if out in the woods and thirsty; used to scoop them where 
they grew thick to feed to the hogs. 
Hence the name. 
"Chicken 
grapes" versus "fox grapes": 
Chicken grapes are smaller, never 
larger than a small blueberry, upland. 
Fox grapes grow in 
swamps, giant sized, best for jelly. (Vitis labrusca for the fox 
grape?, EH, versus several other Vitis species as residual 
"chicken grape"??,EH). 
Gum (Nyssa sylvatica) good wood used to 
make baskets; cut the logs real thin. 
Oaks: "turkey oak" = Quercus stellata, "white oak" = Q.alba, 
"scrub oak" focally is Q. 
ilicifolia, the one with the little 
acorns the deer feed on, but Q. marilandica called "just scrub 
oak," "red oak" = Q. coccinea, "hard to tell from the black oak," 
"black oak" = Q. velutina, "chestnut oak" = Q. prinus, "found 
only on higher ground. 
Tom's cousin 
in Everett Lloyd, 
lives in Estelle Manord, 
built his own 
log cabin home using cedar logs cut from a friend's 
swamp. 
Logs were grooved at the mills--seams sealed by a narrow 
strip of wood that fits into grooves cut in adjacent logs of 
house walls. 
His house 
is just off Rte. 50 half way between Mays 
Landing and Tuckahoe, just south of Lester MacNamara WMA, just 
east of Rte.557N junction. 
Garden of many native plants. 
"Hickory" (Carya sp. perhaps C. glabra, EH, widespread in 
woods near Millville), eat the nuts. 
"Rye" growing in field (I 
think true rye, EH) grown for chicken feed. 
"Tulip tree" = 
Hunn--84 Fieldnotes 
page 90 
Liquidamber styraciflua (EH, note bene). 
We then encountered a 
small snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina), known locally as 
"loggerhead" which I photographed. 
Tom at first glance thought 
it was a "stink pot" (presumably Stenotherus odoratus, EH). 
A 
"stink pot" is so called, Tom says, because the "wet on you" when 
you pick them up, just like the "red—bellied turtle" (Chrysemys 
rubiventris, EH, Tom identified a number of these at the Corgbin 
City dikes, laying eggs in scrapes--as do loggerheads and 
"diamondbacks," that is, Malaclemys terrapin, EH, 
id by Tom). 
The books, however, attribute the name "stink pot" to "a strong— 
smelling musk produced from glands located near the edges of the 
plastron" (Karl Anderson article on Turtles of New Jersey 
in New 
Jersey Outdoors). 
On gypsy moths spraying: they didn't use to spray anything, 
except arsenic and lea d on potatoes . At Hea d of the River he 
pointed out the 1790 Baptist cemetery, where a sign advertises 
annual services, 2nd Sunday of October. 
Head of the river refers 
to the head of tidewater on the Tuckahoe. 
On snappers: the cut—off head will still bite the next day, 
so they cut the head 
in two with an axe as a precaution. 
The Peaslee Tract along Rte. 49: 
All 
state, Green Acres 
property, note sign at Estelle Manor Rd. 
Tom distinguished 
"hardwoods" from "softwoods." 
Oak, a hardwood, not so good for 
timber because when get to size good for lumber there are ants 
and termites all through 
it. 
We passed the Cumberland Methodist Church and cemetery; here 
many of his relatives are buried and here is his own plot. 
On sand company mining: 
lowered water table, ruined 
thousands of acres of south Jersey. 
Atlantic City Electric Co. 
ought land from Tom Brown to build coal fired power plant, but 
building plans have been shelved, hopefully forever (reasons 
unclear). 
The sand company was Monanaco (?) Sand Co., started 
digging here 
in 
1917. 
Later said 
it was the Old Tavern Rock Sand 
Co. train that ran on a track, the remains of which he pointed 
out to me 
in the woods near his house. 
This train ran from 1922 
until 1938. 
I photographed one of his fox trap sets 
in the oak 
woodland near the old stage coach road, Philadelphia to Cape May. 
The sand quarries have now filled with water; excellent fishing; 
a record 10 lb. bass caught here (now state land). 
Quercus prinoides: Tom thought it might be a stunted or 
young "chestnut oak." 
"Sassafras," big ones used for boat 
building, for the bowsprit (Sassafras albidum, EH). 
"Dogwood" 
(Corpus florida, EH, also rather common in the woods about 
Millville, though very scarce 
or adventitious in the core 
Pinelands), used to make handles on oyster boats. 
"Grease bush 
of some kind" for an unidentified shrub. 
Tom noted there were 
four beaver dams in the ponds area of the sand quarries, all 
Hunn--84 Fieldnotes 
page 91 
presumably made by a single family of beavers. 
Quercus 
ilicifolia: true "scrub oak," kind with small acorns, good for 
deer and for wood ducks (Aix sponsa presumable, EH) to eat. 
Hickory nuts no 
longer gathered; too much trouble and he has 
walnuts--with bigger nut--in his yard. 
"Chestnut oak" has a very 
large acorn; as kids he made pipe bowls of them. 
"Poplar" (id uncertain, EH, maybe Liquidamber?) logs used 
for basket lids. 
Basket making business used to be big: Rol 
Mason's mill 
in Belle Plain and Barley's Basket Factory, 
Millville, but no 
longer in operation. 
"Tall swamp blueberries" (presumably Vaccinium corymbosum/V. 
caesariense, EH) pointed out. 
Tom has named a number of favorite 
spots in the woods he used to own (sold to Atlantic City Power, 
now overseen by a black man, watchman, who lets Tom use the 
property) including a patch of swamp he calls "The maple swamp" 
and an old black oak with a large oddly shaped burl he calls "The 
buffalo oak," because he fancies a resemblance of the burl to the 
head of a bison. 
Its an old oak, rotted out at the base and full 
of bees. 
I reached to sample a sumac shrub growing beside the 
road and he sharply warned me not to ever touch that plant; to 
wash 
in hard soap as soon as we got back to the house. 
It may 
well have been poison sumac, Rhus vernix, though I couldn't say 
for sure. 
He called 
it "swamp poison sumac," and Rhus vernix is 
a swamp—loving species, characteristically so (W. Stone, G. 
Petrides). 
Tom says "upland sumac" (Rhus copallina?) 
is also 
poisonous, but not so bad. 
Especially bad 
if you burn it and 
inhale the smoke. 
He pronounced it "shumac." 
He spotted a "puffball," later revised to "toadstool," a 
large mushroom, Amanita like to me, which proved to have a small 
"box turtle" (Terrapene carolina, photo) sitting under it. 
Tom 
says of the "puff ball" that it's not good for anything, but 
if 
you step on 
it the spores puff out like dust. 
He showed me the 
remains of a deer stand (photographed); you use telephone pole 
spikes to get up the tree into the stand. 
Tom then showed me the 
evidence, roundish depressions and couple of feet deep, 
in the 
woodland, where his dad used to dig cellar stone. 
People wood 
dig this soft sandstone and sell 
it by the "perch," a measure 
something like a cord of wood. 
His dad made mortar from burned 
oyster shell/lime. 
"Laurel" blooms in early June. 
"Fox grapes" are found more 
around swamps; the grapes 
in the woods behind his house were just 
"chicken grapes." A 
"mulberry" tree (Morus rubra, EH) was 
growing beside his house: ate the fruits when kids. 
He doesn't 
consider it worth the trouble to pick wild blueberries as you get 
full 
of "jiggers" (that is, chiggers, aka "sand fleas"). 
Concerning Bill Lee's wife (who Muriel believes doesn't like 
her): "she's prickly, dyed in the wool." (I'm not sure I got the 
meaning, but "touchy" might be close, EH.) 
Tom identified ticks 
Hunn--84 Fieldnotes 
page 92 
as 
including the ones with the white spots (common medium to 
large) and the tiny ones, called "deer lice." 
Plants identified by EH that evening: Scirpus fluviatilis for 
a large robust "three—square—like" plant found on salt marsh side 
of Corbin City dike. 
Tom Brown thought it atypical of "three 
square, 
but similar. 
Danthonia sericea, a native grass growing 
along the Batona trail 
in a dry pine—oak area near Batsto (but 
Jim Stasz thought it might more likely be some other Danthonia). 
Cornus florida, for dogwood 
in woods near Millville, 
id by Tom 
Brown as "dogwood." 
Quercus falcata? growing along dike near 
Corbin city, at marsh edge. 
Quercus phellos (willow oak) growing 
along road between Elwood and Weymouth and also on Corbin City 
dike.

Event #1:Blueberry harvest grand tour with Brad Thompson 
(see AEH019,020,021). 
We began at 9 AM at Buzby's General Store 
in Chatsworth by visiting one of Brad's family's fields just 
south of Chatsworth, not yet ready to pick. 
Photos of different 
varieties including Blue Crop, Weymouth, Berkeley, etc., and of 
the packing house. 
Then drove to Retreat to visit Bob Reeves at 
Sheep Run Hill, whose field here 
is heavily infested with Sheep 
Run Hill disease, still mysterious. 
Plants infested look just 
about normal but have little or no fruit. 
They have to be torn 
out (see AEH020). 
Then to the Tru—Blu Coop headquarters where 
Denny Doyle, manager, gave us a tour. 
Just getting set up for 
the big harvest push. 
Denny and Brad discussed the intricacies 
of the blueberry business, especially marketing, competition, 
North Carolina and Michigan operations, grading of fruit, 
spraying, etc. (see AEH0621). 
Then we visited Grace and "Posh" 
(William) ********'s U—Pick operation already beginning to 
process the first berries. 
Photos of packing, picking, etc. 
Finally a brief run through historic Vincentown with Brad 
detailing histories of houses and families. 
Done by 2:30 at 
Brad's house. 
Event #5. 
Short environment tour with Jack Cervetto round 
about Warren Grove (AEH022,023).

TX01: Event #1: 
Visit Jim Stasz, summer forest naturalist, at 
Batsto Nature Center, Batsto: attend his morning (9:30-10:30) 
nature walk to the boggy area where the old mill once stood. 
Event #2: 
Visit with Jo Anne van Istendal, Marlton, NJ, 
with Mary Hufford (see FMH0623). 
EVENT #1: Jim has been at this job for a few weeks now--how 
he got the job and other commentary will be found in PFP84— 
AEHO17)--and this 
is the first time he's had an audience for his 
9:30 AM nature hike, so his itinerary was somewhat spontaneous. 
A couple interested 
in photographing orchids (also affiliated 
with the Dump the Dump group somehow) led him to focus on a small 
sunny bog just below the dam forming Batsto Lake, where the old 
iron works was. 
Also on the morning walk was a couple with two 
young boys. 
First he took them down to the lake shore near the 
nature center where he had located a twayblade, Liparis loeselii, 
at the end of 
its blooming cycle. 
He explained that though not 
planted here, 
it was not a typical pine barrens orchid. 
He 
suspected its presence was due to the human activities associated 
with the 
iron forging, that slag had been dumped on the hillside 
above, where the nature center was now located. 
This had added 
calcium to the soil, a limiting factor for this particular 
orchid. 
On the way to the boggy spot he described how old 
settlements in the Pine Barrens could be 
identified by the 
presence of exotic Catalpa trees, now in full bloom all 
over the 
Batsto grounds. 
In the boggy spot there were lots of rose 
pogonias in bloom (Pogonia ophioglossoides). 
The latin species 
name refers to the plant's resemblance to "adder's tongue," a 
fern relative (Ophioglossum vulgatum). 
Also present was the 
common orchid Calopogon tuberosum, or "grass—pink." 
Jim's interpretation was excellent, not only for natural 
history but for details of culture and history related to the 
plants and animals of the area. 
The little bog had flowering 
cranberry. 
The visitors were surprised to 
learn that cranberry 
has such a flower. 
Jim recounted the virtues of sphagnum moss, 
its ability to sterilize (pronounced Jersey fashion as stir— 
Hunn--84 Fieldnotes 
page 97 
ilize) the water it absorbs (I missed something of this point), 
and that local people contributed to the war effort during WWI by 
harvesting sphagnum moss to be shipped to the European front for 
use as sterile dressings for burns and wounds. 
That was before 
the invention of sterilization procedures for cotton, etc. 
Old 
materia medica list sphagnum as an important item. 
Either the 
moss is sterilized by the acid bogs 
in which it grows or it has 
the power somehow to sterilize. 
He also mentioned present uses 
as floral decoration in green condition. 
He explained why "male berry" (Lyonia ligustrina) was so 
called. 
Early people confused it with huckleberry/blueberry, but 
explained the woody capsules as the "male berry" of the 
huckleberry, on the model 
of dioiceous hollies. 
He identified 
(first time for me) a number of ferns including sensitive fern 
(Onoclea sensibilis), royal fern (Osmunda regalis), cinnamon fern 
(Osmunda cinnamomea) (the last two with odd fruiting bodies that 
look 
like brown ropes 
half hidden by the sterile fronds), and 
marsh fern (Thelypteris sp.), distinguished by y—branched lateral 
veins (versus bog fern). 
He pointed out orange glands on 
leaves 
of Myrica (same as those on Gaylussacia, which he noted as 
definitive of "huckleberry" versus "blueberry"), and noted the 
smell: "bay leaf," of the bayberry. 
Jim was uncertain of 
identity of Vaccinium atrococcum growing here, as 
it did not seem 
mature enough 
in his estimation (thus V. atrococcum does fruit 
earlier than V. corymbosum). 
He thought it might be a hybrid. 
Also Jim does not bother to distinguish V. caesariense from V. 
corymbosum, with good reason, 
in my opinion. 
Jim well versed on sedges, pointing out Eleocharis sp., 
Scirpus americanus ("three square"), which he said was sometimes 
called "chair—maker's sedge" (?) and/or "spear grass," explaining 
its use 
in chair manufacture (or 
in basket making). 
(This S. 
americanus clearly different from the S. olneyi I had keyed out 
the other day--from the Mullica flats--in having a longer 
involucral bract, etc..) 
Jim then showed us a patch of disturbed dry ground almost 
completely covered by 
low growing, exotic weedy plants. 
He 
explained that Batsto at one time was like Baltimore harbor, a 
major industrial center, manufacturing cannon, etc., for the 
revolutionary war effort, with heavy foreign traffic. 
Thus all 
the exotic plants brought in 
inadvertently. 
One of the ladies 
wanted to know why anyone would introduce weeds. 
His answer was 
a graphic account of how those seeds might have smuggled 
themselves in 
in burlap bags, on the dirt on the boot soles of 
immigrants, etc. 
He also mentioned the glass manufacturing, the 
first mason jars made here. 
Some included daisy fleabane, 
Erigeron sp., 
Dianthus sp., Plantago aristata, "rabbit—foot 
clover"--lucky to find a four—leaved one, 
Opuntia vulgaris in 
flower (photograph), Bromus tectorum (Leo Landy's "fluffy 
grass"). 
Jim explained such details as the fact that the Chinese 
elms growing at Batsto might reflect a Maryland tradition that 
Hunn--84 Fieldnotes 
page 98 
only ship's captains could have such elms growing in their yards. 
Also 
in the bog: a bladderwort, Utricularia sp., of 
carnivorous habits, 
like the sundews and the pitcher plant: 
nitrogen poor environment of these bogs encourages carnivorous 
adaptations. 
Bladderworts have no roots. 
Jim described his job as a political one. 
To get it his 
mother had to put 
in a call 
to the past Republican governor, a 
friend. 
It is a summer work slot financed by the state, and 
these are generally political plums. 
No one could be better 
qualified than Jim for this position, but that appeared not 
sufficient cause to grant him the position without political 
intervention. 
EVENT #2: 
Jo Anne van Istendal of Marlton is a 40+ divorcee 
raising her four kids in a ranch style home set on her fathers 
acreage along a branch feeding Taunton Lakes/once Taunton Mill, 
thence draining into the Rancocas. 
She 
is a neighbor of 
Elizabeth Woodford and sometimes an unwilling beneficiary of her 
neighbors animal rehab efforts (e.g., marauding raccoons 
accustomed to human handouts). 
She herself is an animal 
rehabilitator, having nursed back a doe with fawn, and currently 
an adolescent gray squirrel and a large fledgling kestrel 
("sparrow hawk"). 
She raises a variety of other animals for the 
love of 
it, 
including a herd of goats (she's attempting to breed 
a dwarf variety, and they're shrinking at the rate of about an 
inch a year; she's careful to castrate the males 
in an effort to 
prevent someone usurping her breeding efforts--presumably she 
hopes to market these someday). 
She also raises peacocks: they 
are now nearly done displaying and will drop their magnificent 
tail feathers (actually upper tail coverts?) on or very nearly on 
the fourth of July. 
She presented Mary with a bundle to take 
home. 
Mary's conure "Harry" 
is one of Jo Anne's birds; she also 
has half a dozen cockatiels, a double—yellow headed Amazon, 
another smaller Amazon, and a blue and gold macaw, as well as a 
variety of pigeons and chickens and exotic pheasants. 
Also a cow 
and a horse in a nearby field. 
She told a humorous tale of how 
her twin daughters and their friends were camped in the pasture 
when the cow lay down on the tent with a variety of horrifying 
and, to the tenters, inexplicable, noises. 
They ran home fearing 
the Jersey Devil was upon them. 
Jo Anne discussed the foul reputation of the local animal 
auction house--though she may at times buy or sell 
an animal 
through them. 
Status among local 
animal breeder people demands 
that one not be known to do business there. 
Their animals are 
thought to be often diseased, poorly cared for, etc. 
Jo Anne 
is a refreshingly open, warm, natural person. 
Her 
language 
is uncultivated Philly/s. Jersey. 
Her children--teen— 
agers--seeming very positive in attitude (most unusual of teens). 
Her front yard 
is a personal statement, the many meanings of 
Hunn--84 Fieldnotes 
page 99 
which will be detailed by Mary's notes. 
Behind her house are the 
woods through which the stream meanders. 
Here she has been 
constructing nature trails, mostly just following the existing 
deer trails and clearing the brush to create a more open aspect--
appealing to her aesthetic sense. 
She 
is very upset by a law 
suit brought against her by a consortium of 13 lawyers who intend 
to develop the property downstream and who want to rebuild a dam 
on her stream that was washed out in 1940. 
That would flood the 
valley back on to her property, destroying some of her favorite 
spots, streamside meanders where she watched the turtles swim as 
a kid. 
These lawyers are pursuing nuisance suits against her and 
generally playing big money, 
legal hardball. 
She 
is a believer in the need to manage wild areas, 
in 
particular by thinning the forest to encourage better tree 
growth. 
She points to a thicket of "swamp maple" as 
indicative 
of the distorted growth pattern due here to a series of human 
alterations (which 
in and of themselves she considers a "natural 
cycle"), from harvesting cedar swamp, to bog iron mining, which 
prepares the way for cranberry cultivation, which when abandoned 
led here to an even growth stand of stunted, too dense maple. 
A 
similar phenomenon was noted in an even aged stand of pitch pine, 
all 20 years old following the last fire, and all 
stunted by 
crowding. 
Proper woods management involved culls such stands. 
Woods management is also good insurance against wild fires. 
Controlled burning would be the ideal means, she notes, but is 
now impossible in such a built up area, as 
if the fire were to 
get out of control, all 
the neighbors would sue. 
She plans no 
trail signs or other "artificial" elements. 
She just wants a 
peaceful place where she and her kids can watch the dog 
investigate weasel holes, chase the scent of deer, etc. 
A note on environmental perception. 
Jo Anne's yard is 
dotted with chestnut oak (Quercus prinus) "rings." (my term). 
Jo 
Anne explains these as due to the effects of fire killing the 
original tree, which then sprouts around the bole, producing a 
ring of 5-6 small, outward curved trunks with a bowl-like 
depression in the center. 
Fire may again kill this first 
generation ring producing a second generation ring, wider and 
more numerous. 
She uses these bowls as 
1) a watering trough for 
her birds, 2) a planter for daffodils (the bulbs of which 
otherwise would be "swallowed up" by the Pine Barrens sands, and 
3) a frame for her kids elaborate tree house. 
It seems possible 
that this pattern of post-fire sprouting 
is characteristic of the 
chestnut oak, as no other species there (including post oak, 
black oak, scarlet, blackjack, and scrub (Q. 
ilicifolia) appeared 
to do the same. 
This might possibly have some relation to the 
tale of the "jail house oak" (cf. McPhee?). 
Jo Anne confirmed the poisonous properties of "stagger-bush" 
(Lyonia mariana, EH, called "calf kill" by Jack Cervetto, as well 
as other locals apparently), producing a difficult lingering (2-3 
days) death. 
"Sheep laurel" (Kalmia angustifolia, EH) killed her 
Hunn--84 Fieldnotes 
page 100 
llama, and local vets had no antidote for it. 
Their property is 
registered as a tree farm, to avoid the 
ruinous residential tax rates on a large acreage (bought when 
cheap). 
So the state forester comes out from time to time to 
advise them on how to grow such preferred pulp wood species as 
white pine (Pinus strobus, EH), all planted in neat rows, of 
course. 
She commented how she and her father agreed to such an 
unnatural planting at their urging, so 
long as 
it was screened 
from sight from their house. 
Lots of ticks in the brush. 
She's 
rather accustomed to them, but noted the little tiny ones are new 
to the area, she doesn't know why. 
She also had much to say of the history of her property and 
vicinity, of the old road that the Pineland's Commission 
Archaeologist failed to mention in his inventory, etc. 
See 
PFP84—FMH0623, for more detail. 
I left Marlton about 5:30 and paid a late visit to Glassboro 
Fish and Wildlife Management Area at Clayton on my way home. 
It 
was quiet with an approaching thunder storm, so added no new 
birds, but did collected a couple of plants (see above).

TXO1:Event #1: 
Brief visit with Jim Stasz at Batsto Nature 
Center ca 8:30 AM. 
Met Mary Hufford there, discussed the history 
of the center, Annie Carter's role, etc. 
Left ca 10:30 AM to 
meet Bill Lee at Moore s Beach 
Jim said the so—called "puff adder" of the locals was the 
hog—nosed snake (Heterodon platyrhinos, EH, which, says Conant, 
is characterized by "hissing, head— and neck—spreading, and 
playing 'possum." 
Conant describes its favored habitat as sandy 
areas, not in keeping with Cervettos description of swamp habitat 
of "whomper" and ? "puff adder"). 
"Whomper„" if short and fat, 
could also refer to Heterodon, Jim suggests, but he has never 
heard the term. 
A study of the distribution of breeding birds 
in New Jersey 
Pine Barrens cedar swamps was published ca 1979-1980 in New 
Jersey Audubon magazine. 
This reported finding about 50 Glack— 
throated Green Warblers, a population disjunct from the highlands 
populations. 
The nature center at Batsto history goes back to ca 1962-
1963 when the Pinelands Conservationists got started. 
Jim's 
mother was the secretary, his father a founding member, with 
Annie Carter, Ruth Patrick, Dave Fables, etc. 
(see PFP83—AEHOO) 
The nature trail was constructed along the south side of 
Batsto Lake, funded by the Federation of Garden Clubs of New 
Jersey. It has now been totally vandalized and destroyed by 
neglect. 
People used to come from all 
over the region to see it. 
Four—wheel drive vehicle types have torn it up. 
The nature 
center was funded by the New Jersey Federated Women's Clubs, 
its 
library, named the Dave Fables library, was donated by Pinelands 
Conservationist members. 
Jim recommends Lawrence Newcomb's wildflower field guide, 
published in 
1978 by Little & Brown, at $8.95 hardback. 
He 
describes it as an abridged, 
illustrated "Gray's" (i.e., Gray's 
Manual...) 
Lou Hand helped illustrate the Pine Barrens 
endemics/specialities. 
An original of Witmer Stone's Plants of 
Southern New Jersey (not the reprinted edition) sells now for 
Hunn--84 Fieldnotes 
page 102 
$1000-2000. 
Jim has two copies. 
From a display of Annie's: the huge nest of the bald—faced 
hornet, Vespa maculata. 
EVENT #2: 
We arrived too late at Moore's beach, as a local 
young man informed us he had left not 10 minutes before we 
arrived. 
We could see his net in place (photos). 
Also windrows 
of dead horseshoe crabs (which Bill Lee calls "king crabs," he 
sets his gill net high enough off the bottom so they can crawl 
under it.) 
So we headed for Port Elizabeth hoping to catch him 
with his fish haul 
at Bailey's, the fish buyer. 
Instead we 
caught John Bailey, proprietor of that enterprise. 
No, Bill had 
not come in that morning. 
John was most gracious and willing to 
talk all 
about the fishing business, crabbing business, health of 
the bay, etc. 
We photographed his operation, as he'd just 
received a small 
load of menhaden ("bunkers"), most about 6-8 
inches long. 
He sells them for crab bait. 
He also had a few 
weakfish and a blue fish which, having been caught with the 
bunkers smelled of bunkers, and thus were not marketable. 
Both 
are excellent food fish. 
He also had some "butter fish," ditto. 
He sells a cardboard flat (with plastic liner) of menhaden, 
weighing 50 Ibs, for $9.00, or ca 19 cents a pound, direct to 
crabbers. 
So his business in this fish depends on what the crabs 
are doing. 
This led to a long discussion of crab. 
Mary asked 
if 
he dealt in 
"soft—shell crab," he said yes. 
All 
crabs shed. 
They gain 2X or more in size each time. 
That's 
the only way they can grow. 
A crab 
is called a "peeler" just 
before he sheds, then a "shedder." 
The soft—shell season/the 
time of shedding progresses up the coast. 
Within 1 and 1/2 hours 
the crab's new skin gets like paper, so timing is critical. 
Crabs are then known as "white crabs" or "poor crabs" (since they 
use up their reserves of "meat" in building their new skin?EH) 
for the next 2-3 weeks, then "they're back to blue crab again." 
The crab have been poor here since 1976 (hurricane Agnes? EH). 
He believes the cold winters have killed them off. 
"Wind's got a 
lot to do with crab," as 
'they move on a south wind, squat on a 
north wind." 
That affects how easy they are to catch. 
When the 
crabs gave out "it made a big change." 
Many people were out of 
work, many switched to fishing then. 
The operation 
fish on 
ice, 
metal trough, 
into what loo 
liners on the 
left several 
fish or bait. 
we photographed involved taking a barrel 
of 
tipping it up, dumping the fish out onto a sheet 
hosing the blood, etc., off the fish, dumping them 
ked like plastic milk crates, then into the plastic 
cardboard 50 pound trays, ready to sell. 
As we 
carloads of people had come up, apparently to buy 
John described Bill Lee with patient affection. 
He noted 
that "they" don't let him go out 
in a boat anymore, due to his 
bad heart and advanced years. 
He'll buy whatever Bill brings in, 
Hunn--84 Fieldnotes 
page 103 
"even eel," in part to humor him, but not at all 
in a patronizing 
way. 
Bailey seemed to hold Bill 
in high regard and said they all 
take rare of him. 
John asserted that Jersey crabs were superior to 
Maryland/Chesapeake crabs, not that they taste any better, but 
because they are hardier, don't die off on you so readily, thus 
are more profitably marketed (?). 
He described some complex 
exchanges between Jersey and Maryland crab fishermen and buyers, 
the crabs going both ways at one time or another. 
(Reasons 
unclear to us.) 
EVENT #3: 
We found Bill Lee at home at his daughter's house 
in Millville, his nets rolled up 
in a washtub in the back of his 
old pickup. 
He had the old snapperer fyke ready for us that he 
said he give us. 
Said he hadn't caught anything this morning, 
but had just a few to show: so we photographed a bunker, blue 
fish, and weakfish, not worth selling. 
He cleaned them for us, 
taking about a minute for each one (photographed). 
We recorded 
an hour's worth of reminiscences (see PFP84—AEHO16). 
He 
demonstrated how to mend a net (photos), a skill he picked up 
from an old timer. 
Apparently it 
is a skill not everyone has a 
talent for, as he was the only one 
in his family to develop it. 
We talked of the demise of the bunkers, of snappering (he caught 
them and ate them but never cleaned them; he delivers them 
nowadays to Bailey's, as with his fish). 
Also described the 
birds of the bay shore. 
Blue and white heron (never used to say 
"egret"), 
ibis, white poke (Snowy Egret, "white heron" 
is 
the 
Great Egret, apparently), blue poke (either green—backed heron, 
or perhaps the set of Little Blue Heron, Louisiana Heron, etc.), 
and the "squawk" (Black—crowned Night Heron). 
Great Horned Owls 
he considers very destructive; they steal his muskrats from 
traps; but ospreys or seahawks he 
likes. 
He has seen eagles 
(bald eagle) steal their fish, but if the fish drops and sinks, 
the eagle will 
let 
it be. 
Only the osprey dives, actually under 
the water. 
Mary and I left about 3PM for Batsto. 
I arrived in time for 
the 
last half of Jim Stasz's afternoon meadow nature walk before 
he got off work. 
We then headed for Martha's Bog, the "best bog 
in 
the Pine Barrens," as rain threatened. 
We needed Jim's 4— 
wheel drive Subaru to get in from Harrisville due to the wanton 
destruction of the 4—wheel drive people, who tear up the roads 
just to make them more of a challenge, to the point where the 
Forest Services fire trucks can't even get through many places. 
But it's too expensive to fix them. 
A running account of our 
conversation and exploration of the bog 
is 
on PFP84—AEHO17. 
The 
bog lived up to expectations and more. 
Strongly reminiscent of 
interior Alaskan black spruce bogs, an effect accentuated by the 
dark low clouds and cool 
rain and mosquitos. 
The white cedar has 
much the same gestalt as the black spruce, characteristic conifer 
of boreal bogs. 
It 
is a dark, somber green, and an often dwarfed 
spire—like tree, growing tightly clumped 
in and fringing the 
Hunn--84 Fieldnotes 
page 104 
northern bogs. 
(Contrast this to the tropical rain 
forest/Amazonian gestalt of the swamp hardwoods at Glassboro 
woods on a steamy late morning (just the next day!). 
Jim introduced me to such rare and characteristic plants of 
the Pine Barrens as bog asphodel (Narthecium americanum), which 
reaches its northern limit here, to 
lots more rose pogonia and 
grass—pink, showy bog orchids, to a few virtually invisible curly 
grass ferns (Schizaea pusilla). 
He pointed out three (of nine) 
species of bladderworts, numerous pitcher plants, the odd gray— 
and gold Lophiola americana (gold—crest), and all three species 
of sundews. 
He named perhaps two dozen species of sedges, 
rushes, and grasses, the plants that best test the mettle of the 
botanist. 
Off and on a pine—barrens tree frog would honk at us, 
but we were never able to spot the little devil crouched on a 
cedar branch. 
We mucked our way for nearly a mile up the margin 
of the Oswego branch and Jim pointed out geological, botanical, 
and sociological phenomena of the area. 
He described the worst ravages of plant collectors, 
in one 
notorious case a wealthy New Englander hired professional 
botanists to mark all the unusual plants, then sent a team of 
workers down to dig up every one. 
He was trying to recreate the 
bog on his Connecticut grounds. 
He noted a spot where the sedges 
had been trampled down as a sign of a recently botanical field 
trip. 
Still, he felt the bog had great resilience, our footsteps 
only temporarily ruffling its surface. 
At the Harrisville Ruin Jim showed me one individual of the 
extremely rare Pine Barrens plant (at the southern limit of 
its 
range), the Sickle—leaved Golden Aster (Chrysopsis falcata), 
which I photographed in flower. 
Jim says only some three sites 
are known in New Jersey, all 
in the Pine Barrens. 
W. Stone notes 
the plant's preference for dry sands, especially around "the 
sites of former forges or wayside inns," typical of the disturbed 
ground preferences of most rare Pine Barrens plants.

TX01: Event #1: 
Birding and botanizing with Jim Stasz at 
Glassboro WMA, near Clayton, NJ, and en route to Parvin State 
Park. 
I met Jim at New Brooklyn Lake at 7:30 AM. 
He was busy 
when I arrived keying out the new rush he'd found at Martha's Bog 
the previous evening, using the latest edition of Britton and 
Brown, author Gleason, 
in three volumes. 
He's not perfectly 
satisfied with Gleason, as he's too much a "lumper" for Jim's 
taste, 
in particular he doesn't always note varietal distinctions 
important for understanding the local flora. 
Britton and Brown, 
as well as Newcomb's wildflower guide, follow Gray's Manual 
in 
defining the limits of their treatment by the southern border of 
Virginia/Kentucky (west to the Mississippi River, North to 
where?). 
Even so, several hundred plants are added by the 
inclusion 
of the southeastern corner of Virginia, plants of sub— 
tropical derivation. 
We proceeded to the Glassboro woods after leaving my car at 
Ed Boyd's house 
in New Brooklyn--Ed couldn't come along as he'd 
had to work late the night before and needed sleep. 
Last 
evening's thunderstorms had passed, 
leaving the woods cool 
and 
fresh, the side roads puddled. 
Many birds singing, but not as 
response to Jim's eastern screech owl tape as would be the case 
two or three weeks previously. 
Many were now preoccupied feeding 
young. 
As before, we traversed the woods from north to south. 
Quickly found hooded , kentucky, and worm—eating warblers, the 
latter rare, but it came 
in for a brief view besides singing. 
The Kentucky Warbler is even less common, Glassboro woods being 
one of very few spots for it 
in south Jersey. 
Jim noted the 
association of Hooded Warblers and Prothonotary Warblers--which 
we called in a bit further into the woods where there was a 
flowing stream. 
Also had a Louisiana waterthrush here. 
All 
three of these warblers may be found in the Pine Barrens, but 
only by canoeing the rivers. 
They'll be some where the rivers 
pass through maple—gum swamp. 
Black—throated Greens, however, 
are 
in the cedars, an isolated lowland population (as noted 
previously). 
At the pond crossing we heard what were probably 
Green frogs (Rana clamitans) and certainly carpenter frogs (Rana 
virgatipes, at the northern limit of 
its 
limited range here). 
Jim noted the carpenter frog as a Pine Barrens indicator species, 
Hunn--84 Fieldnotes 
page 106 
another example of the Pine Barrens affiliation of the Glassboro 
woods outlier (though beyond the political 
limits).

TX01:Event #l: Conversation with Gerald Parsons, Library of 
Congress reference librarian about rail birding. 
Jerry 
is very 
interested 
in 
rail birding and other forms of water fowl hunting, 
on the Chesapeake as well 
as on the Delaware R./bay and 
elsewhere. 
He's planning a field trip there in which he joins an 
expert rail birding enthusiast from the Chesapeake, such as Jim 
Owings, or from up the Delaware River, such as Frank Astemborski 
of Delanco, NJ, with a local Maurice River "pusher." 
They would 
then compare notes about rail birding traditions, boats, 
ecological conditions, etc., 
in these various places. 
Another 
excellent resource he recommended to me are the popular writings 
of Tom Marshall (who died last year), especially a chapter 
published in Raymond Camp's "Duckboats, Blinds, etc..." 
Railbirding has historically attracted famous and upper 
class gunners, 
into fond and sometimes lasting association with 
the 
local 
"pushers." 
A sport of presidents such as Theodore 
Roosevelt and Harry Truman, and of Washington elite, who could 
take off a couple of hours--just before the tide peaks is 
ideal--
squeeze in some rail birding into their busy schedules. 
Thomas 
Aikens, famous watercolor painter of landscapes, did a number of 
watercolors illustration impressions of rail birding on the 
Cohansey R. 
in sw Jersey. Now, they say, there's no more rail 
birding on the Cohansey, Jerry doesn't know why. 
The railbird 
hunting club, "The Sora Club," 
is now closed down there. 
Railbirding season lasts 5-6 weeks, from the first of September 
through early October, with peak conditions the 2nd to 3rd week 
of September. 
The Sora is the 
preferred species, found in fresh 
to brackish, tidally influenced marshes, with tall wild rice 
(Zizania palustris, presumably) or cattail (Typha sp.), but 
increasingly (unfortunately) of "foxtail" (as 
it 
is everywhere 
called, Phragmites communis). 
"Pushers" must be expert and 
strong. 
Strength is needed to push the boat into the tall marsh 
vegetation to flush the rails for the gunner, and to push the 
boats right up to the shallowest margin of the marsh, where the 
"butterfly weed" grows. 
Jerry didn't know the identity of this 
plant, but said 
it had yellow flowers, grew at the very edges of 
the marshes, and was best cover for the Sora rails. 
I believe it 
Hunn--84 Fieldnotes 
page 108 
is a milkweed, Asclepias lanceolata, about which W. Stone 
reports, "Found only along the coastal strip, where the salt 
meadows join the mainland; somewhat locally distributed and not 
detected north of Pt. Pleasant, which is therefore, the most 
northern station for the species, as 
it does not range north of 
New Jersey. 
... It's flowers are larger than those of any other 
species and the brilliant red and orange coloring makes 
it 
especially conspicuous among the many showy flowers of the marsh 
edge. 
... 
It 
is, 
so far as New Jersey 
is concerned, strictly 
confined to the edge of the salt marshes, where they join the 
upland" (pg. 650). 
Other relevant plants include "nut sedge," which grows in 
the tidal zone. 
Jerry noted that a "yellow nut sedge" had been 
introduced from Africa in 
an early attempt to find a new food 
with appeal to Black people, but it had not succeeded, but the 
plant became well established adventitiously. 
"Wigeon grass" is 
a subaquatic grass; grew in the marshes of Delaware Bay when the 
water was crystal clear (!). 
This 
is different from the "eel 
grass 
that Snow Geese favor (Zostera sp., presumably). 
Another 
marsh plant is "wild celery." (ID uncertain, EH). 
Wild rice 
is 
being pushed out be a Japanese runner grass (ID uncertain, EH). 
I noted the limited distribution of Zizania in south Jersey, 
perhaps a limiting factor on rail birding? 
Jerry says rails are delicious, very fat. 
I noted that is 
to be expected in a long distance migrant bird, fattening itself 
(fueling up, 
in effect) for a long, perhaps non—stop, flight of 
thousands of miles. 
This same pattern underlay the commercial 
exploitation of shorebirds such as the Eskimo Curlew (Numenius 
sp.). driven virtually to extinction by gunners in the late 
1800's. 
Rail birding differs, however, 
in never having 
commercial potential due to the fact that rails flush singly, and 
pushing 
is hard work. 
Pushers must also be able to read very subtle features of a 
marsh. 
For example, differences in "elevation," and areas of 
"floating marsh," where the aquatic vegetation has come loose 
from the bottom. 
Areas such as this are like "peanut butter," 
in 
Jerry's terms. 
Pushers must learn to stay out of such areas. 
Marshes have "high" and "low" places, 
in the eyes of the pushers. 
Set of tide and of wind very important to sense. 
The rails 
themselves are somehow able to sense the moment the tide turns, 
even though, at the peak of the tidal sine curve everything is 
in 
slow motion. 
Soras will flush readily until the tide turns, then 
they run rather than flush. 
So rail birding must be done just 
before high tide. 
Clapper rails are salt marsh rails. 
Sometimes King and 
Virginia Rails are flushed by rail birders. 
Jerry's first rail 
was a King, 
in fact. 
Yellow and Black rails are too small. 
The 
focus 
is clearly on the Sora, as an abundant migrant (only an 
uncommon or rare breeder) with very high fat reserves. 
What do 
Hunn--84 Fieldnotes 
page 109 
rails eat? 
Neither of us was sure, but probably mud dwelling 
crustaceans, or insects and other invertebrates on the marsh 
vegetation rather than seeds, as of the wild rice. 
On the ravages of Phragmites: In Maryland it 
is 
illegal 
to 
cut Phragmites to use to disguise one's boat or to build a blind, 
for fear this will spread it. 
A still common belief 
is that 
rails turn into frogs. 
One day the marsh will be full 
of rails, 
the next day, no rails, but lots of frogs! 
(Perhaps the rails 
migrated?) 
Rai Ibird skiffs are different from sneak boxes and 
vary a great deal 
regionally. 
Mary Hufford said that PFP had 
some pictures of Maurice River skiffs, they have runners on the 
bottom, an unusual feature. 
Edna Greenwell, of Pig Point on the 
Patuxent, knows all 
the local pushers there. 
I requested that 
Jerry bring back some plant samples from his planned September 
field trip to Maurice River. 
LIST OF PLANT SPECIES OF 
ETHNOBOTANICAL INTEREST IN THE PINELANDS OF SOUTHERN NEW JERSEY, 
compiled by E. Hunn. 
Scizaeceae: 
Schizaea pusilla Pursh. 
Curly grass. 
A rare species at its 
southern limit here; known for New Jersey from Pine Barrens bog 
sites only. 
Of 
interest to students of plant life and a species 
characterizing the unique Pine Barrens bog landscape. 
Grows best 
on big sites disturbed by cedar logging or bog mining. 
Listed as 
"threatened" on national 
list. 
First described from a specimen 
collected in 1805 at Quaker Bridge. 
See also S. Little, 
in New 
Jersey Outdoors 1:16-18 (1974). 
Jim Stasz. 
Polypodiaceae: 
Asp lenium pIatyneuron. 
Ebony fern. 
An uncommon, evergreen 
fern characteristic of old settlements. 
Found at Harrisville 
ruins, for example. 
Disjunct from montane populations; wind 
distributed; requires mineral nutrients such as provided by 
lime 
in mortar of old stone constructions. 
Jim Stasz. 
Onoclea sensibilis. 
Sensitive fern. 
Common in damp areas, 
widespread. 
Marketed by Hazel and Leo Landy as "fern seed," at 
$3/100. 
Lycopodiaceae: 
Lycopodium carolinianum. 
Carolina club—moss. 
A characteristic 
associate of curly grass 
in Pine Barrens bogs. 
Here 
is 
at the 
northern limit of 
its range. 
Jim Stasz. 
Pinaceae: 
Pinus strobus L. 
Eastern white pine. 
Not native to the Pine 
Hunn--84 Fieldnotes 
page 110 
Barrens, but a valued ornamental planting (of. NR). 
Grown for 
pulp wood on properties designated tree farms for tax incentives, 
as at J. 
A. van Istendal's in Marlton. 
See MH, EH. 
Pinus virginiana Mill. 
Scrub pine. 
Called "spruce pine" by 
Tom Brown, Millville. 
Wood is good for lumber if 
you can find a 
large tree that is not "limby," a characteristic of the species. 
An uncommon pine in the Pinelands, typical of "old field" 
situations, in succession. 
Pinus echinata Mill. 
Short—leaved or two—needle pine. 
Called 
"two—leaved pine" (Freeman Taylor), "smooth—bark pine" (by Tom 
Brown), or just "echinata" (by Leo Landy). 
Most readily 
distinguished from Pinus rigida by bark and lack of limbs on 
lower trunks of 
larger trees (T. Brown, F. Taylor). 
Jack 
Cervetto of Warren Grove does not include it 
in his pine 
classification, perhaps because it 
is not frequently seen 
in his 
immediate vicinity. 
This pine 
is 
less successful after fire than 
P. 
rigida, and 
is absent from the Plains entirely, thus perhaps 
scarce in the Warren Grove region. 
Most abundant in an 
association with scarlet oak (J. McCormick, 
in R. Forman, p. 
239). 
Pinus rigida Mill. 
Pitch pine. 
Called "bull pine" by Tom 
Brown and distinguished from "smooth—bark" and "spruce" pines by 
roughbark, limby—ness, etc. 
Differentiated into "bull pine"--a 
swamp ecotype with particularly hard and durable wood--"pitch 
pine" or "upland pine"--the typical form, and "scrub pine"--the 
dwarf P. 
rigida of the Plains--in Jack Cervetto's classification. 
The dwarfed populations of the Plains are thought to have 
resulted from natural selection for frequent, hot wild fires over 
centuries. 
Such trees have a much higher frequency of serotinous 
cones--i.e., opening only after a fire--produce cones at an 
earlier age and 
in greater quantity than standard P. 
rigida, and 
have a genetic tendency to be multi—stemmed. 
J. Cervetto has a 
tree 
in his front yard he grew from seed brought home 
incidentally to collecting pine cones for sale which 
is tall--
thus 
in Jack's view demonstrating the importance of soils--but 
multi—stemmed. 
This dwarf growth form and tendency to produce 
abundant, closed cones is the key to the development of "pine 
coning," collection of closed cones, forced open in hot houses, 
for sale 
in the decorative plant markets of the region. 
The 
Plains, of course, 
is the ideal setting for efficient cone 
collection. 
Bill Wasiowich and Jack Cervetto collect or have 
collected cones. 
Hazel and Leo Landy and Allyn's of Whiting cure 
and market the cones. 
P. 
rigida also valuable once for lumber; 
now for pulp wood, as part of a major local 
industry (cf. P. 
Wacker and J. 
E. Applegate, S. Little, and P. E. Marucci, 
in R. 
Forman). 
P. 
rigida is an earlier successional species on upland 
sites, eventually replaced by oaks 
if not burned. 
J. Cervetto 
considers the presence of a dense, tall stand of "upland pine" 
in 
a stretch of "oak bottom" a sure sign of previous human 
occupation in which the oaks had been pulled out. 
This 
is a sort 
Hunn--84 Fieldnotes 
page 111 
of "cidious bottom" (from "deciduous") found on uplands. 
See R. 
E. Good, N. F. Good, and J. 
W. Andresen, 
in R. Forman. 
P. 
taeda L. 
Loblolly pine. 
Not native to the Pinelands but 
introduced by S. Little, especially in the hybrid P. 
taeda X P. 
rigida, as a promising timber tree combining the high growth 
potential of P. 
taeda with the cold tolerance of P. rigida. 
Such 
a hybrid is successfully grown in Korea for reforestation (see F. 
T. Ledig and S. Little, 
in R. Forman, pg. 367). 
Chamaecyparis thyoides (L). 
Atlantic white cedar. 
Characteristic tree of Pine Barrens bogs. 
Local populations are 
known as "Jersey cedar" or "swamp cedar" (the latter term 
contrasting with "upland cedar," Juniperus virginiana) and the 
basis of an industry pre—dating European settlement. (As a book 
can and will be written on this tree, I will 
leave 
it this for 
now.) 
JL, MH, EH, etc. 
Juniperus virginiana L. 
Eastern red cedar. 
Locally known as 
"upland cedar," as distinct from "swamp cedar," Chamaecyparis 
thyoides. 
A species marginal to the Pine Barrens, rather charac 
teristic of the border zone of the coastal and Delaware Valley 
margins of the Pine Barrens. 
Typhaceae: 
Typha latifolia L. 
Broad—leaved cattail. 
Less abundant than 
the next and more restricted to fresh water pond margins. 
Cut 
and dried for the decorative plant market by Hazel and Leo Landy, 
but not as 
important as "miniature cats," the variously sized 
populations of the next. The broad—leaved cattails are advertised 
by the Landy's as "jumbo cats" and sold for 25 cents each. 
Cat 
tails generally are considered very important food for muskrats 
and an important material used by muskrats in constructing their 
houses (T. Brown, B. Lee). 
State fish and Wildlife managers may 
use herbicide spraying to favor growth of "three—square" (Scirpus 
olneyi, S. americana)--a favorite duck food--at the expense of 
the taller cattails and similar marsh plants (T. Brown). 
Typha angustifolia L. 
Narrow—leaved or coast cat—tail. 
More 
abundant than the preceding and especially numerous in 
tidal/brackish marshes, as on the Mullica—Wading estuary. 
Here 
L. Landy collects up to 10,000 a day during a three week season 
in June when the plants are 
in 
ideal condition for curing. 
He 
collects three sizes of "miniature cats," the "small miniatures" 
selling for $3.50/100, the "large miniatures" for $4.25/100.
