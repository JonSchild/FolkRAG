ALONZO THE BRAVE AND MS FAIR IMOGENE 
Chant. 
AIR—" Fine Old English Gentleman." 
I'LL relate to you a 
story I 
suppose you all do know, 
At least 'twas told to me a 
very long time ago; 
It is all about a 
friend of mine named Alonzo, 
Who among the female population was quite the beau. 
ALE—" Promised a 
Lover." 
Now this young swell a 
sweetheart had, as fair as e'or 
was seen--
She had light-blue eyes and flaxen hair, and was only sev-
. 
enteen; 
And he was just turned twenty-one, and what you might 
call green, 
To place his young affections on the faithless Imogene— 
This foolish, soft young countryman, the subject of my 
theme. 
AIR—" Norma." 
Alonzo the brave and his fair Imogene conversed as they 
sat aide by side, 
And, squeezing her hand—you all know how I 
mean— 
Said, " Dearest, dearest, wilt thou be my bride—wilt Um 
be my bride?" 
I* 
6 
ALONZO THE BRAVE. 
AIR—" Sprig of Shillalagh." 
Sounds so joyful, blest, revealing 
Chloroform-like, o'er his senses stealing, 
So she answers him in tones of feeling, 
" 
You must ask my respectable pa-paw!" 
Then went Alonzo to seek the old man, 
And to gain his consent tried to hit on a 
plan, 
By which he could marry his fair Imogene; 
The wars they were on, the Baron was bold— 
He had once been a 
soldier, but now's rather old. 
Said he to Alonzo, " If you will but go there, 
And join our brave army, I 
do not much care.", 
Ata—" My Lodging is on the Cold Ground." 
"But ah," said the youth, ft since to-morrow I 
go 
To fight in a 
foreign land, 
Some other may court you, and you may bestow 
On some wealthier suitor your hand." 
" 
Oh cease those suspicions," fair Imogene cried, 
Ere for another my heart should decide, 
Forgetting Alonzo the brave—" 
Aia—" Lord Lovel." 
He had not been gone but a 
year and a 
day, 
To fight in a 
foreign countree, 
When a 
Baron, all covered with jewels and gold, 
Came and asked 'her his spouse to be, be, be, 
Came and asked if she'd marry he. 
The Baron he certainly bothered her so, oh oh, oh oh, 
That to the church she consented to go, 
Which was very wrong of her; you know. 
The guests were invited, and every thing done; 
The moments flew by with " uproarious fun," 
Till the bells in the castle at length sounded one, 
Bow wow, wow wow-,—oh oh, oh oh! 
The guests in a 
fright from the table did run— 
The reason you shortly shall know. 
ALONZO THE BRAVE. 
'7 
AIR—" Mistletoe-Bough." 
A 
figure unearthly the hall up did glide, 
And seated himself at fair Imogene's side; 
His air was terrific—he uttered no sound; 
He moved not, he spoke not, he gazed not around; 
His visor was down, in black armor he shone, 
And Imogene's features grew ghastly and wan; 
The lights burned blue, and the ladies, they say, 
As is usual in such cases, fainted away: 
Oh, for poor Imogene's vow—poor Jimmy, you're in for it 
now! 
(Spoken.) This is what the ghost said (his air was tor-
rifle): 
AIR—" Lucrezia Borgia." 
"Behold me! you told me you'd be true, but you've sold 
me— 
List to your own broken vow: 
You said that, to punish your -falsehood and pride, 
My ghost at your wedding should sit by your side, 
Charge you with perjury, claim you as bride, 
And bear you away to the grave beside! 
Since you did your oath forego, 
Down amongst the dead men, down amongst the dead men 
you must go!" 
(Rollicking randy dancly 01) 
Now, ladies all, pray take a 
moral 
From my delightful history: 
When your lover fights for a 
warrior's laurels, 
Never give way to perjury. 
Tel de rol de rol, etc. 
For in these days of tabM-turning, 
They may be turned on you; 
Don't think ghosts can't be returning, 
For we showed you that they do. 
Tol de rol de rol, etc. 
If doubt on this tale you're throwiu', 
The original parties can be seen: 
Just call on Robert Owen, 
And he'll fetch up Alonzo and Imogene. 
Tot de rol de rol, etc. 
BRUDDER BONES'S LAMENT. 
As sung by RODEY MA-atria& 
I'VE wandered around Yorkville, 
I 
have wandered to the shop, 
And listened for your footfall, 
And yet you corneth not. 
There was no sound of fire-bells, 
No sound of engines near, 
But the tinkling of the old bones 
Was all, that I 
could hear. 
Chorus---,But the tizkling, etc. 
I 
sat down in the stable, 
And gazed upon the trees— 
And as it grew still darker, 
I 
thought I 
heard you near; 
When I 
think I 
hear your footfall, 
I 
listened for a 
word, 
Butple tinkling of the old bones 
Was all the sound I 
heard. 
But the tinkling, etc. 
You did not come, and r 
was sad, 
The night even darket: grew fast; 
The police eyed me surprised, 
And even dogs howled as I 
passed. 
I 
once again struck up that tune— 
You thought I 
sang so like a 
birdl 
But the tinkling of the old bones 
Was all the sound I 
heard. 
But the tinkling, etc. 
THE COUNTRYMAN'S VISIT TO LINDENMULLER'S. 
Written and sung by RODEY M AGUIRE. 
AIR—" Sprig of ShIllalah." 
A COUNTRYMAN coming to New York one day, 
Determined at night to go see the play. 
(Symphony.) 
So he asked a 
stranger, he chanced to meet, 
If he'd show him the Bowery, and he'd stand treat; 
He had heard that the show of the city was there— 
The performers the best, and the girls charming fair 
(SYmPla.) 
The man answered " Yes," and up Spring street they went, 
To the famed Lindenmuller's their course it was bent. 
(Symph.) 
The newly- made friends then quickly walked in, 
Just as the performance was about to begin. 
The countryman stared, and with mouth opened wide— 
" 
This place must be heaven, and no spot beside." 
(Symph.) 
Now the girl whom *an angel the countryman thought, 
Had just from the waiter a 
brandy-punch sought. 
(Symph.) 
He gazed on tier figure so plump and so round, 
While she, feeling bashful, but looked on ,the ground. 
But he, growing bolder, aside modesty flings— 
Commenced touching her stocking, to find had she wings. 
' (Symph.) 
The girl I'm alluding to I 
can now see— 
She's winking and blinking-and nodding to me. 
(Symph.) 
I 
would tell you her name, but she's bashful I 
know, 
And indeed it might get me just into a 
row; 
But she told him the mad- house was his just deserves, 
If he thought to find wings growing out of her calves. 
(Symph)

THE STAGE-STRUCK SCHOOLBOY. 
Now, all you young fellows, take warning by me— 
Do not think all is heaven where angels you see. 
(SYmPh-) 
There is so much beauty now visits this halls 
'Tis likely each night into love you will fall; 
But mind what you're after, if they you inspire— 
If you want to know more, come to Rodey Msguire. 
(Symph.)

As

left behind me."

My true-lub's gone a-minin'; 
He ran away wid a 
yaller gal, 
And left me here repinint.

THE STAGE-STRUCK SCHOOLBOY, 
As sung by RODEY MAGUIRE. 
W HEN I 
was a 
boy, I 
went to school gayly— 
I 
did not care for the birch, though I 
tasted it daily; 
At school-times I 
ranted, and whirled my shillalah, 
For I 
was always playing the fool. 
THE STAGE-STRUCK SCHOOLBOY. 
11. 
Chorus—Oh dear, what's to become of me? 
Oh dear, what's to become of me ? 
Oh dear, what's to become of me? 
I 
am quite a 
disgrace to his school. 
(Spoken.) " Come up," says the master to me one day, 
"anespake that piece I 
taught you to get off." 
Divil a 
mind did I 
mind the ould master, but gave him what come 
first. 
(Spouts.) My name is Norval. 
On the Grampian Hills 
My father fed his flock on frugal swine. 
He was a 
man take him for all in all, 
I 
ne'er will look 
his like again! 
What says 
The fool of Hoburst's offspring? I 
do remember 
An apothecary lived here somewhere about, 
But no more like my father than I 
to 
Hercules. 
0 
my prophetic soul! my uncle, 
Give me a 
horse—bind up my wounds. 
o.be or 
Not to be, that is the question. 
I 
am weary 
Of conjectures, and this must end them !— 
"It must!" quoth the master, with rage his head tossing; 
"Is this any place to give me your saucing? 
Instead of a 
horse, I 
will give you a 
horseingl" 
And he tied me quite fast to a 
stool. 
Oh dear, etc. 
(Spoken.) " Since there is no more of the birch left, I'll 
bate you no more at present."—" Thank you, sir,"- says L 
I 
thought I 
would give the master a 
piece of my mind. 
I 
, 
mounted a 
form, with shillalah in hand, and held it forth 
thus: 
(Spouts.) Most potent, grave,' and reverend seignior, my 
very novel and approved good master, thou haat wronged 
me by a 
vile blow; I 
have been your faithful slave too 
long. 
I'll set my life upon a

of the die. 
Hence, babbling dreams! thou threaten here 
ix vain.

VERY POLITE OF ITER. 
VERY POLITE OF HER. 
Written and sung by RODEY Meavras. 
OWE night to a 
concert I 
went, 
I 
was dressed in my best from top to toe; 
As merry an evening I 
spent— 
Among the ladies, dear creatures, I 
love to go. 
I 
walked up the room in good style— 
There sat a 
sweet girl, I 
caught sight of her; 
She said, " Take a 
chair"—gave a 
smile— 
Now wasn't that very polite of her?" 
Chorus—Fol lob, etc. 
As we sat side by side on the chair, 
My very heart-strings seeped to crack again; 
I 
threw a 
sheep's-eye at the dear, 
And she in return threw it back again. 
I 
called for two glasses of lager-bier, 
Which very much gladdened the sight of her; 
She finished her glass and mine— oh, dear I 
Now wasn't that ver,T polite of her? 
' 
Fol lol, etc. 
Says I, " Miss, take something to eat ?" 
I 
thought she would like a 
nice taste, so I 
Went into a 
shop down the street, 
And bought half a 
dollar's worth of pastry. 
A 
puff, tart, or gooseberry-pie, 
She said it was quite the delight of her; 
They were gone in the wink of an eye-
- Now wasn't that very polite of her? 
Fol lol, etc. 
To drink brandy-smashes T 
gained her consent, 
Forgetting my landlord had called that day; 
When every shilling I 
had spent— 
My God! then thinks I, " There's the rent to pay!"

VERY POLITE OP HER. 
I 
did not expect her abuse, 
Which you must all know was not right of her; 
She says, " 1 
am married, you goose I" 
Now wasn't that very polite of her? 
• 
Fol lol, etc, 
With rage I 
began for to stamp, 
When she came in and bounced about, 
And said if I 
did not decamp, 
My head she would quickly trounce about. 
She hit me a 
box on the head, 
And knocked me down on to 
of her • 
Says She, " You are down, stay all night"— 
Now that was very polite of her. 
Fol lol, etc. 
There was 'somebody about smelt the rat, 
Through the key-hole he todk sight of us; 
It was her husband—who would have thought that, 
That beheld the beautiful sight of us? 
He stood outside in amaze— 
He thought it not right at all of us; 
So he got himself very near crazed. 
For he thought it very impolite of us. 
Fol lol, etc. 
At length the police he called in, 
And all over the room they did follow me; 
Not knowing the mule I 
fell in, 
Two metropolitans did collar me. 
For assistance and mercy I 
prayed— 
She said I 
intruded, in spite of her; 
To the watch-house they had me conveyed— 
Now wasn't that very polite of her ? 
Fol lol, etc. 
Next morning the fine was twenty dollars, 
To give this sweet damsel to quiet her; 
No money nor friend could be found— 
To prison they sent me as a 
seducer.

My landlord a

He had seized on my sticks every mite of them, 
'Cause I 
owed ten dollars for rent— 
Now wasn't that very polite of him?

I 
have now got out of the jail, 
Wherein I've shown my agility; 
Folks say I'm wonderful pale,

Yet have the look of respectability. 
If I 
could see a

GOOD gentlefolks, give ear, I

The truth I'll tell you, one and all,

One shoe was little, the other *as big; 
He made a 
hit, and the boys did call 
To do it agaih in the concert-hall. 
Chorus—Tol de rol de riddle la, etc. 
Then the orchestra began to fill 
Their instruments for a 
quadrille: 
A chap with a 
cornet loud did play 
" 
We won't go home till the break of day." 
Then the waiter-girls, dressed neat and gay, 
Like full-blown flowers in the month of May, 
Some were short and others tall, 
But the lager flew about in that concert-hall. 
Tel de rol, etc. 
Then Out came a 
girrto dance a 
fling, 
The men to her did bouquets fling; 
The boys cried out, " She's a 
bully egg," 
Because she showed a 
handsome—foot. 
But what pleased me most of all that night 
Wat4 the burlesque international fight; 
They fought in a 
ring, and each other did maul, 
And both won the fight in that concert-hall. 
Tol de rol, etc. 
Then came a 
fellow to sing a 
song, 
A very old one—Lord knows how long; 
And every verse sung by. that scrub 
Was something about the " Lazy- Club ;"

My head was so full of lager-bier; 
So for a

did call, 
To steady my nerves in that concert-hall.

Then a

And by my side she took a

So, to cut a

For a

had to call. 
Then I 
asked if I 
could see her home, 
Where we could sit and chat alone; 
Said she, putting her hand to her nose so small, 
"You can't buzz me in the concert-hall."

CELTIC AND TEUTONIC; 
Or, Lager- Bier and Irish Whiskey. 
Written expressly for and sung by RODES MAGUIRE. 
NOW, boys, if you'll listen, I'll sing you a 
good song, 
And its merit you'll find is, it's not very long; 
It's of this and of that, of the country and times, 
Secession and Union, and them kind of rhymes. 
Chorus—For there's nothing but trouble about now, 
. Though Secession is almost played out now; • 
For the lovers of " praties" and " kraut" now 
Shake hands for the Union and laws. 
When first from old Sumter the smoke of the fray, 
With a 
thundering echo, rolled out on the say, 
And the Yankees awoke from their dreaming and rest, 
And found out they'd stirred up a 
young hornet's nest— 
Oh, then was hoping and fearing, 
Oh, then was the cinick volunteering, 
And in rushed the sons of Old Erin, 
To fight for the Union and laws. 
But bedad it's not me that's going to brag— 
For along wid the boys of the Emerald flag, 
Wid a 
fire in their eye and a 
smile on their face, 
Bent the red- whiskered sons of the Teutonic race. 
Oh, ' twas whiskey and lager combined then, 
While the oht-Yankee blue intertwined then; 
Ah, sure by the gods ' twas designed then 
To save the Union and laws. 
It was then that Secession grew pale with affri'ght, 
As the GERMANS and Ittisirmarch firm ha the fight; 
And with Mealier to lead them, and Sigel to save, 
Sure ' twas many a 
rebel went down to his grave. 
Oh, twos then that ould Jifferson Davis 
Swore Secession was all gone to blazes, 
And in that same on dit he gave us , 
In saving the Union and laws. 
Now the war is ' most over;and bloody ould Mars 
Smiles continuedly down on the Stripes and Stars; 
And the boys to their homes will soon be marching back, 
Their good lager to quail aud their whiskey to smack. 
And if France takes a 
notion to growl then, 
"Or Johnny Bull round us should prowl then, 
They'll find we are cheek by jowl then, 
To light for the Union and laws. 
SAM, where does Neptune stable his horses? 
Why, in the sea-mews, of course.

SITTING in a

Going with a

Tallest kind of music 
Singing in your phiz I 
Hear the breaks a- squeaking 
When she gives a

Bless me! ain't it awful, 
Travelling by steam? 
Dust and smoke are flying, 
And fill your pretty hair; 
Fat old lady fahiting, 
Because she wants fresh air; 
Lovesick miss a- reading 
From a

Dear me! ain't it funny, 
Travelling by steam? 
Milestones past are flying— 
Lord, what an awful speed! 
Lots of babies crying 
For their precious feed; 
Country bumpkins chewing, 
"Guess she is a

Gracious! ain't it charming, 
Travelling by steam? 
Gray old chap is nudging 
Miss slyly with his knee, 
The Frenchman is a-snoozing 
Over his rapparee;

Eyes with rapture beam—

Jolly newsboy screaming, 
Cries the morning papers, 
With his rags a-streaming, 
And cuts all sorts of capers. 
Creation! hear the squealing, 
When we go to cross a

Now there's a 
precious lot of fun, 
Travelling by steam. 
Hungry sharpers eyeing 
The crowd with eager look; 
Gouty gent is trying 
To hide his pocket-book.

And, thinking you are green, •

HO ONE TO DRINK—NO ONE TO SMOKE. , 
Written for RODBY M AGITIRE7 by J. R. RAYMOND. 
No one to drink—no one to smoke, 
Except an old bummer, or else an old moke; 
And if you get drunk, you must Elia it alone, 
For in your drowsiness you're as snug as a 
bone; 
No watchman's voice (or cod-liver oil) 
Makes you rejoice, or your cares beguile. 
No one to drink—no one to smoke, 
Except an old bummer, or else an old moke. 
No one to dance with, or to theatre go,. 
Except that old bum who sticks to you so; 
And if you feel sick, and go there a.lone, 
You feel just as if you'd have sooner stayed home. 
No gentle voice, no loving Smile, 
Make you rejoice, except you have a " pile." 
No one to drink—no one to smoke, 
Except that old bum,- or slumbering moke. 
A BAG OF NAILS, 
As sung by RODEY MAGUIRE. 
Am—" 
Bow, wow, wow." 
MY 
merry, gentle people, pray 
Come listen to me a 
minute: 
AlthotIgh my song it is not long, 
There is something comic in it. 
To sing of nails, if you'll permit, 
My sport it must intend, sir— 
A 
subject that I 
now have got 
Here at my fingers' end, sir. 
Chorus—Bow, wow, wow, etc. 
The women are a 
bag of nails, 
And some are mighty queer, sir; • 
And some are tall and some are small, 
And some are plaguy dear, sir; 
Some like nails with monstrous heads, 
And some have none at all, sir I 
Some do simper out their words, 
And some give a 
loud squall, sir I 
Bow, wow, wow, etc. 
Now an ofd man he's a 
hob-nail, 
He'll rust for want of use, sir; 
A miser is no nail at all, 
He's but a 
rusty screw, sir. 
An enemy would get some " clouts" 
If to Washington they'd roam, sir; 
For our volunteers, like hammers, would 
Be sure to drive them home, sir I 
Bow, wow, wow, eta. 
The doctor nails you with his bill, 
Which oft times proves a 
sore nail, sir; 
The undertaker wishes you as dead 
As any door-nail, sir I 
THE BOW-WOW-ER-AY. 
You'll often see each agent 
Nailing his employer; 
The lawyer nails his client, 
But the devil nails the lawyer! 
Bow, wow, wow, etc. 
Dame Fortune is a 
brad-awl, 
And oft times does contrive it 
To make each nail go easy 
Where'er she choose to drive it. 
So if I've gained your kind applause, 
For what I've sung or said, sir, 
Then you'll admit that I 
have hit 
The right nail on the head, sir I 
Bow, wow, wow, etc.

Now, kind friends, I 
pray you all draw near--
A song I'll sing to you, I 
want you all to hear; 
So give me your attention for a 
little while, I 
pray, 
While I 
sing you something new about the Bow-wotv-er-ay 
If you're coining up the Bowery at ten o'clock at night 
(Perhaps you have been drinking, and got a 
little tight), 
You may chance to knock agin a 
man—when not a 
word 
he'll say, 
But he'll send you flat upon your back, up the Bow-wvw-
er-ay I 
Then, as you are proceeding towards your home,, 
A-
humming to yourself some familiar little tune, 
Some young lady will step up to you, and so nicely say, 
"You, George ?—would you like to take a 
walk with me, 
up the Bow-wow-er-ay ?"

QUIET LODGINGS. 
But then, on rainy days, whatTretty sights you see I 
The streets they are so nasty, you'll get mud up to knee; 
The gals all like to promenade upon a 
rainy day, 
For they Can show their pretty ankles on the Bow-wow-
er-ay, 
Joe Coburn sends a 
challenge all on to Jamie Mace, 
Saying, money and man are rea-ay- to fight him any place: 
If these gladiators meet, and Joe should win the day, 
What a 
bully time the boys will have on the Bow-wow-
er-ay I 
Now if you want good lager-bier, to Lindenmuller's go, 
Where you can hear good singing, and see a 
great show; 
I 
will do my best to please you, when on me you call, 
So three cheers for brave Sigel, and Lindenmulier's Hall I 
Now, kind friends, my song it is done, 
And with these few remarks hope I've offended none; 
So, if you'll call to-morrow night, all I've got to say 
Is, that I'll have a 
new edition of the Bow-wow-er-ay. 
QUIET I 
ODGINGS. 
As 
sung by RODEY M AGUIRE. 
ALL you who love retirement free, 
I'm very sure you'll pity me, 
Who all my life have been used, you see, 
To a 
very quiet lodging. 
You must know that word was sent me down, 
That my good old Uncle Brown 
Had died, and left me every crown, 
So I 
must go and live in town. 
I 
wrote to my cousin, Jemmy Wood, 
To ask him if he'd be so good 
As to find me, in his neighborhood, 
A very quiet lodging 
QULET LODGINGS. 
All right—in town I 
arrived next day, 
And to my lodging went straightway; 
And I 
found it really was au fait— 
A very quiet lodging: 
'Twas in a 
street without any thoroughfare, 
Close to the Dry Dock, I 
declare, 
Where the river runs at the end so clear, 
And sends up such refreshing air I 
Says my landlady, with looks, demure, 
"You'll find them clean and very pare;" 
So I 
took them for a twelvemonth sure, 
Those very quiet lodgings. 
Next morning, just before I 
rose, 
Or poked my head from out the clothes, 
I 
heard a 
brute chanting, " Off she goes I" 
In front of my quiet lodging; 
And he had hardly moved away, 
And I 
hoped to be quiet all the day, 
When a 
barrel organ began to play 
Nix, my dolly pals, fake away!" 
And he had hardly left the place, 
When there came two fifes and a 
double bass, 
,A-blowing away in my very face, 
In front of my quiet lodging. 
To rave and curse I 
did begin, 
To find how I'd been taken in, 
When another infernal musical din 
Saluted my quiet lodging: 
A man with bagpipes now had come, 
And blowed out of his bag such a 
rum-to-turn, 
'Twas enough t
o st
rik e the old one dumb; 
Just lik9 an owl it screeched, by gum! 
And not content with number four, 
He kept the street in a 
wild uproar, 
And played five tunes at every door, 
As well as np- quiet lodgings. 
My dinner I 
hoped to get in peace, 
But, Lord! the nuisance wouldn't cease-

LOVE AND BACON. 
It seemed rather more to increase, 
Around my quiet lodgings. 
A Gellnan brass band now hove in view. 
With drums, trombones, and cornet too 
And they kicked up such a 
phillaloo, 
I 
wished they'd split their throats in two 
And just when they had hardly fled, 
Two chaps, as if by instinct led, 
Began punching each other's head, 
In front of my quiet lodging! 
With rage I 
then did puff and swell, 
Out bx the roots I 
jerked the bell; 
My landlady rushed up pell-mell, 
In my very quiet lodging. 
" 
Are these your quiet lodgings, pray ? 
I'll leave your house this very day!" 
" 
Ah, sir I 
but before you go away, 
A twelvemonth's rent you've got to pay !" 
I 
paid the cash with a 
sad grimace, 
And rushed out of the cursed place; 
I 
slammed the door in the old hag's face, 
And I 
cursed her quiet lodgings. 
LOVE AND BACON. 
As 
sung by RODEY 
THE spruce Mister Clark was a 
young Essex spark, 
A farmer uxorious and rich; 
He loved, dearly as his life, fried bacon and his wife, 
And says be," My duck, we'll claim the flitch." 
Mistress Clark ('twas in bed) loved bacon, she said, 
But she vowed she'd no more see it spoiled; 
Crying, " Clark, you're quite mistaken if you think to fry 
that bacon, 
I 
insist that every bit shall be boiled." 
ACTING MAD. 
29 
Mister Clark, though ' twas night, jumped in bed bolt up-
right, 
Quite enraged at his rib by his side; 
And says he, " Now, madam, mark! though I 
love you, 
Mistress Clark, 
I'm d—d 
if it shan't all be fried!" 
The dispute ran so high, 'twist a 
boil and a 
fry, 
That Clark, though he argued it roundly, 
Put an end to all turmoiling, as to frying and to boiling, 
By basting Mistress C. very soundly. 
The turtles, no doubt, very soon found out 
That their claim to the flitch must be shaken; 
They had children blithe as larks, but all the little Clarks 
Were marked with a 
rasher of bacon!

Tiddy dol lol lol lay, tiddy dol lol lol lay, 
Phillelu, subbaboo, drimandu, mushagrah! — 
When singing and spaking was such a 
sort of undertaking 
as was executed according to nature, 
He or she who attempted to execute either was something 
like a 
rationable creature; 
And your stage- players of old ( to be sure we are told they 
would strut like a 
turkey or bustard), 
But they knew no more about grinning and grunting, and 
making faces at one another, than they did about 
making of mustard.

TIIE IRISHMAN'S THEATRICAL DESCRIPTION. 
The great Turk, in a 
pet—I 
mean Bajazet—when by Tam-
erlane he was taken in battle, 
Like a 
bear with head sore, blood and turf, how he'd roar, 
While his chains did melodiously rattle! 
And old Shylock the Jew, his long knife he drew, to be 
sticking in the poor merchant's beef; 
But divil a 
Christi in soul but what said to him in their 
hearts, " Bad luck to yez, ye butchering old thief !" 
Tiddy dol lol lol lay, etc. 
Then thick-lipped Othello, that sooty-faced fellow, that 
choked his poor wife in her bed, sir, 
Would have made all the blood in your body run cold, and 
the hair almost stand on end on your head, sir; 
And when crooked King Dick bid his kingdom for a 
horse 
—it's true, upon my life, it's no fable—, 
The divil a 
one in the whole place would lend him a 
jack-
ass. though they'd half a 
score in the stable. 
Tiddy dol lol lol lay, etc. 
Then Macbeth stuck the poor king in his sleep, with a 
pair of 
French-looKing daggers, 
Struck the folk with his guilt, and the blood that he spilt, 
Like a 
horse whey' he's struck with the staggers; 
And Macbeth sung, when he was going to be hung—a 
man can die bolder by brandy— 
And the ladies in the boxes, from the duchess to the dox-
les, would be saying, " To be sure, he's quite the 
tippy and the dandy." 
Tiddy dol lol lol lay, etc. 
Now, to make an end of my song—to be sure, it's rather 
long—but then, as to the words and the tune, 
\ 
You're not only welcome as the flowers in May, but wel-
come as the roses in June; 
Now, don't take it in your noddle to say it is all twaddle, 
nor let any of it put you in a 
passion; 
Because, upon my conscience, a 
little bit of nonsense, 
now-a-days, is the tippy and pink of all fashion.

WOMAN. 
As sung by ROPEY MAGmat. • 
(By transposing the second and third lines of each verse of this song, 
the sentiment will be reversed. As it now stands, it is any thing 
but flattering to the merits of the fair sex; while, with the trans-
position suggested, it will be found to contain a 
high and just 
encomium on woman.) 
HAPPY a 
man may pass his life, 
While free from matrimonial chains; 
When he's governed by a 
wife, 
He's sure to suffer for his pains. 
What tongue is able to declare 
The feelings that in woman dwell? 
The worth that falls to woman's share, 
Can scarce be called perceptible. 
In all the female race appear 
Hypocrisy, deceit, and pride; 
Truth, darling of a 
heart sincere, 
In women seldom can abide. 
They're always studying to employ 
Their time in vanity and prate; 
Their leisure hours in social joy 
To spend, is what all women hate. 
Destruction take the men, I 
say,- • 
Who make of women their delight! 
Those who contempt to women pay, 
Keep prudence always in their sight.

He sent to me a 
letter, 
And in it did say 
That if I 
did not marry him, 
He'd throw himself away! 
But you know the blessed Bible says 
It is a 
sin to kill; 
So I 
thought the matter over, 
And—I 
rather think I

BEAUTIFUL SLIGO. 
As sung by RODEY MAGUIRE. 
MY 
father and mother was gintlefolks true, 
But all their affairs did awry go, 
Because they could not make their whiskey-shop do 
In the nate little city of Sligo. 
Trade went on badly, they both fretted sadly, 
My father looked down, and let many a 
sigh go*; 
Sure mver a 
man's luck, he swore, went so madly 
Ill in all the county of Sligo. 
(Spoken.) No; bad luck to the likes of as ever you saw! 
We was a 
dacint family, so we was. 
Now there was me 
and my sister Jimmy and my brother Judy, my father 
and my mother, the brindled cow, the cat and dog, an old 
BEAUTIFUL SLIGO. 
35 
sow and thirteen little pigs, all sitting round the floor and 
waiting to be served with their praties and butthermilk. 
" 
Silence!" says my father, " bad luck to yez I 
not a 
word 
out of one o' yez but Irish, and dam little o' that I"— 
" 
Who'll say grace ?" says my mother. " I 
will," says my 
sister, and so she did; and she said, " May we not bust 
our bellies with *hat we eat!"—" Amen !" says the pigs. 
"Arrah," says my brother Phelim, " the pig's run away 
wid my praties 1"—" There, niver mind, acushla," says my 
mother, " niver mind, he'll drop it as soon as it burns his 
mouth. 
There, he's dropped it already."—" Bad luck to 
ye!" says my faffer, " why can't you be like your mother 
there, contented with the peelings?" 
Chorus. 
And thus day after day the time passed away, 
And all our affairs did awry go; 
Though by poverty bent, we were all content, 
In the beautiful city of Sligo. 
Soon I 
grew up a 
big man, do ye see, 
And to learn all my letters did I 
go 
To Father Fogarty's, for faith it was he 
Kept the very best college in Sligo. 
All sorts of laming quickly disearning, 
The rest of the scholars I 
soon gave the by-go; 
For reading or writing, jumping or fighting, 
• 
I 
was the best scholar in Sligo. 
(Spoken.) So I 
was, so I 
was, and Father Fogarty him-
self tould me so. " Pat," says he. " Sir," says I. " You're 
a 
cane and dacint youth," says he, " so you are, and I'll 
make you my head teacher, so I 
will."—" Thank you, sir," 
says I. 
And he did make me the head teacher—and I 
teached all the boys and the girls, 
Now, thin, there was 
one girl named Biddy McGee. 
Och, beautiful Biddy I—I 
used to tache Biddy, and Biddy used to tache me, and the - 
divil a 
bit of taching did either one of us want. 
All at 
wunst I 
got pale in the face, and could not drink my pra-
ties or eat my butthermilk. " What's the matter wid ye?" 
says my mother. " Faith, mam," says I, " 1 
dunno. Whin

I 
goes to bed at night and gets asleep. I 
lays awake al the 
time."—" How do you feel?" says my father. " Faith, 
sir," says I, " I'm in a 
feeling from the sole of my head to 
the crown of my feet."—" Fire and turf!" says my father, 
" 
the boy's in love." 
And so I 
was, up to ray armpits. 
Thus day after day, etc. 
My father he took me directly from school, 
And bid me to clean the pig- sty so; 
He said that such hot work would make my love cool, 
And I'd bring no disgrace upon Sligo. 
My pride it was hurted to be so diverted, ' 
To dame the pig- sty divil a 
bit would I 
go; 
And so wid my parients I 
got quite at variance, 
So I 
resolved to bid good-by to Sligo. 
(Spoken.) Yes, I 
made up my mind to lave home, because 
I 
found out my father was only my uncle. • My mother, 
God bless her, gave me a 
handful of tin pennies for a 
bless-
ing, and she says to me—" 
Pat, my son, behave yourself 
nate and clone and dacent, wherever you go, and the divil 
a 
father will you want as long as your mother'
s ali
ve."—  
" _Thank you, says I. 
So I 
packed up ray Sunday clothes 
in a 
bundle. 
All I 
had was a 
pair of stockings and a 
cot-
ton handkerchief. I 
threw them on my shillalah, and took 
a 
dutiful lave of the poultry, such as the pigs and the cow.. 
And I 
thought, " Before I 
dig, I'll go and see Biddy." 
So 
I 
wint down to the beautiful clabin where she lived by the 
side of the bog; so I 
took up a 
handful of pebbles and 
threw 'ern at the window—not at the window, but inside 
for divil a 
window was th ere i
n the 
whole house! "SO 
come out, Biddy," says I. " Is that yourself; Pat?" says 
she. - " Divil the one else," says I. " Where are yez go-
ing?" says she. " On a 
tramp," says I. " Where to?" 
says she. " Oh, a 
low, way from here," says I. " Will

,7ye write -me a 
letter when ye get there?" says she. " The

•there is no mail runs," says I. " Och, worm, worm., what

I 
do at all at all?" says she. " Begad," says I, " the 
iloiCye can do is to come wid me."—" Will yez marry me,. 
THE WIDOW MAHONEY. 
It 
if I 
do?" says she. " I 
will," says I. " An' faith. then," 
says Biddy, " I'll go wid ye, even if it is to the other end 
of the world."—" Bad luck to yez I" says I, " for ye have 
just hit the nail on the head, for that is the very place I 
am going to." 
Thus day after day, etc. 
So we packed up our trifles and away we wint, 
Our relations gave all the by- go; 
And we are married, and though we are poor, we're con-
tint, 
Far away from the city of Sligo. 
THE WIDOW MAHONEY. 
As sung by RODRY M AGURRE. 
OCil! love it is inurther. T 
wish it was further, 
For faith I'm inclined to get rid of my life; 
I'm out of my senses. arrah 1 
beside the expenses, 
And only because I'm in want of a 
wife. 
The Widow Mahoney, she was my crony, 
Only her heart was so hard and so stony; 
" 
Och, widow," says I, " stop my bachelor's trade, 
Or as sure as I 
live, I 
shall die an old maid!" 
Chorus—Och, WidoW Mahoney! 
The Widow Mahoney was tall, stout, and bony, 
Her husband had left her to plough the salt seas— 
He'd gone to the bottom, his guineas she got ern, 
So without any labor she lived at her ease; 
A 
beautiful cratur as any in nature, 
And just like -myself, too, in every feature. 
"Och, widow," says I, etc. 
I 
scorned to be scaly, so I 
treated her daily, 
As sure as the night came, to whiskey and tea; 
And there in a 
noddy, her beautiful body 
Would sit cheek by jowl o' one side behind•ine.

ROWNSON MUMS. 
SO, to finish the matter, Mr. Rooney was fatter, 
And then with his blarney he throwed his eye at her. 
"Och, widow," says I, etc. 
Ere long they had tarried, they 'greed to be married; 
So lovingly went to the priest to be wed, 
When who should be stalking to stop their sweet walking, 
But the widow's live husband, the man that was dead! 
Mr. Mike was confounded, the widow she swounded, " 
The man picked her up, and.the neighbors surrounded; 
So there I 
was left to my bachelor's trade, 
And through Widow Mahoney must die an old maid. 
Och, Widow Mahoney! 
THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON 01W.. 
SOB, 
As sung by RODBY Meutriun. 
'
W REN I 
was a 
lad, 
I 
had cause to be sad, 
My grandfather I 
did lose, oh! 
I'll bet you a 
can, 
You have heard of the man, 
His name it was Robinson Crusoe I 
Perhaps you have read in a 
book, 
Of a 
voyage that he took, 
4nd how the raging whirlwind blew so, 
That the ship with a 
shock 
Drove plump on a 
rock, 
Near drowning poor Robinson Crusoe. 
Poor sooll nonekbut he 
Remained on the sea— 
Ah, Fate, Fate! how could you do so? 
ashore he was thrown, 
On an island unknown, 
0 
poor Robinson Crusoe I 
He wanted something to eat, 
And he sought for some meat, 
But the cattle away from him fle4 so— 
That, lytit for his gun, 
He'd been surely undone, 
0 
my poor Robinson Crusoe I 
But he saved from aboard 
An old gun and a 
sword, 
And another odd matter or two, 
That by dint of his thrift, 
He managed to shift— 
Well done, Robinson Crusoe! 
And he happened to save, 
From the merciless wave. 
A poor parrot—I 
assure you'tis true so; 
That when he'd come home 
From a 
wearisome roam, 
She'd cry out, " Poor Robinson Crusoe l" 
He got all the wood 
That ever he could, 
And stuck it together with glue so, 
That he made him a 
hut, 
which he might. put 
The carcass of Robinson Crusoe. 
He used to wear an old cap, 
And a 
coat with'long nap, 
With a 
beard as loeg as a 
Jew, so— 
That by all that is civil, 
He looked like a 
divil 
More than like Robinson Crusoe! 
And then his man Friday 
Kept the house neat and tidy— 
To be sure ' twas his duty to do so; 
They lived friendly together, 
Less like servant than neighbor— 
Lived Friday and Robinson Crusoe.

PURTY MOLLY BRALLAGHAN. 
At last an English sail 
Came near within hail— 
Oh, then he took to his little canoe, so— 
That on reaching the ship, 
The captain gave him a 
trip 
Back to the country of Robinson Crusoo. 
PIIRTY MOLLY BRALLAGHAN, 
As 
sung by RODEY M AGUIRE. 
An, then, mam dear, did you never hear of purty Molly 
Brallaghan?* 
Troth, dear, I've lost her, and I'll never be a 
man again, 
Not a 
spot on mykhide will another summer tan again, 
Since Molly she has left me all alone for to die. 
The place where my heart was, you might easy rowl a 
turnip in, 
It's the size of all Dublin, and from Dublin to the Divil's 
Win; 
If she chose to take another, sure she might have sent 
mine back again, 
And not to leave me here all alone for to die. 
Maul dear, I 
remember, when the milking-time was past 
and gone, 
.We went into the meadows, where she swore I 
was the 
only man 
That ever she could love—yet, oh! the base, the cruel 
one, 
After all that, to leave me here alone for to die! 
Main dear, I 
remember as we came home the rain be-
gan; 
I 
rowled her in. my frieze coat, though divil a 
waistcoat I 
had on, 
And my shirt was rather fine-drawn; yet, oh 
the base 
and cruel one, 
After all that, she left me here alone for to die.

PATRICK.

I 
went and tepid my tale to Father McDonnell, mam, 
And thin I 
went and axed advice of Gounsellor O'Connell, 
mam— 
He tould me promise-breaches had been ever since the 
world began. 
Now, I 
have only one pair, raam, and they are corduroy! 
Arrah, what could he mean, mann ?—or what would you 
advise me to? 
Must my corduroys to Molly_go?—in troth, I'm bothered 
what to do; 
I can't afford to lose both my heart and my breeches too; 
Yet what need I 
care, when I've only to die ? 
Oh, the left side of my carcass is as weak as water-gruel 
mam— 
The divil a 
bit npon my bones, since Molly's proved so 
cruel, mam; 
I 
wish I 
had a 
carabine, I'd go and fight a 
duel, mam— 
Sure, it's better far to kill myself, than stay here to die. 
I'm hot and detarrninwl as a 
live salamander, mam I 
Won't you come to ray' wake, when 1 
go iny long mean-
der, mam? 
Oh, I'll feel myself as valiant as the famous Alexander, 
mam,. 
When I 
hear yez crying round me, " Arrah, why did ye 
die?" 
THE BIRTH OF ST, PATRICK, 
AS 
sung by RODET MAGUIRE. 
ON 
the eighth day of March it was, some people say, 
That St. Patrick at midnight he first saw the day; 
While others declare 'twas the ninth he was born, 
And ' twas all a 
mistake between midnight and morn; 
For mistakes WILL ,
occur in a 
hurry and shock, 
And some blamed the babby, and some blamed the clock— 
Till with all their cross-questions, sure no one could know 
If the child was too fast, or the clock was too slow.

THE BREAM. 
Now the first faction-fight in Ould Ireland, they say, 
Was all on account of St. Patrick's birthday: 
Some fought for the eighth—for the ninth more would die, 
And who wouldn't see right, sure they blackened his eye I 
At last, both the factions so positive grew, 
That each kept a 
birthday—so Pat then had two; 
Till Father Mulcaley, who showed them their sins, 
Said, " No one could have two birthdays but a 
TWINS!" 
Says he, " Boys, don't be fighting for eight or for nine, 
Don't be always dividing—but sometimes combine: 
Combine eight with nine, and seventeen is the mark, 
So let that be his birthday."—" Amen," says the clerk. 
"If he wasn't a 
twins, sure our hist'ry will show 
That, at least, he's worth any two saints that we know!" 
Then they all got blind drunk, which completed their bliss, 
And we keep up the practice from that day to this.

THE WEDDING OF BALLYPOREEN. 
AS 
sung by RODRY M AGUIRE. 
DESCEND, ye claaste nine, to a 
true Irish bard, 
You're old maids, to'be sure, but he sends you a 
card, 
To beg you'll assist a 
poor musical elf , 
With a 
song ready made—he'll compose it himself— 
About maids, boys, a 
priest, and a 
wedding, 
With a 
crowd you could scarce thrust your head in, 
A 
supper, good cheer, and a 
bedding, 
Which happened at Ballyporeen. 
'Twas a 
fine summer's morn, about twelve in the day, 
All the birds .fell to sing, all the asses to bray, 
When Patrick the bridegroom and Oonagh the bride, 
In their best bibs and tuckers, set off side by side: 
Oh, the piper played first in the rear, sir, 
The maids blushed, the bridesrnen did swear, siri, 
Ohl Lord, how the spalpeens did stare, sir, 
At this wedding of Ballyporeen I 
They were soon tacked together, and home did return, 
To make merry the day at the sign of the Churn; 
-When they sat down together, a 
frolicsome troop, 
Oh, the banks of old Shannon ne'er saw such a 
group! 
There were turf-cutters, thrashers, and tailors, 
'With harpers, and pipers, and nailors, 
And peddlers, and smugglers, and sailors, 
Assembled at Ballyporeen. 
THE WEIDigNia OF 13ALLYPOREEN.

There was Bryan McDermot, and Shaughnessy's brat, 
With Terence, and Triscol, and platter-faced Pat; 
There was Norah McCormick, and Bryan O'Lynn, 
And the fat, red-haired cook-maid who lives at the inn; 
There was Sheelah, and Larpy the genius 
With Pat's uncle, old Darby Dennis, 
Black Thady, and crooked McGennis, 
Assembled at Ballyporeen. 
Now the bridegroom sat down to make an oration, 
And 113 charmed all their souls with his kind botheration: 
They were welcome, he said, and he swore and he cursed 
They might eat till they swelled, and might drink till they 
burst! 
"The first christening I 
have, if I 
thrive sirs, 
Here again I 
do hope you'll all drive, sirs; 
You'll be welcome all, dead or alive, sirs, 
To a 
christening at Ballyporeen." 
Then the bride she got up to make a 
low bow, 
But she twittered and felt so—sue could not tell how— 
She blushed and she stammered—the few words she let 
fall, 
She whispered so low, that she bothered them all; 
But her mother cried, 
Whatl are you dead, child? 
Oh, for shame of you! hold up your head. child; 
Though I'm sixty, I 
wish I 
was wed, child— 
Oh, I'd rattle at Ballyporuenl" 
Now they sat down to meat, Father Murphy said grace; 
Smoking- hot were the dishes, and eager each face; 
The knives and forks rattled, spoons and platters did play, 
,And they elbowed and jostled, and walloped away; 
Rumps, chines, and fat sirloins did groan, sirs; 
Whole mountains of beef were cut down, sirs; 
They demolished all to the bare bone, sirs, 
At this wedding of Ballyporeen. 
There was bacon and greens, but the turkey was spoiled, 
Potatoes dressed both ways, both roasted and boiled

Hogs' puddings, red herrings—the priest got the snipe— 
Culcannon, pies, dumplings, cod, cow-heels, and tripe! 
Then they ate till they could eat no more, sirs, 
And the whiskey came pouring galore, sirs; 
Oh, how Terry McManus did roar, sirs !— 
Oh, he bothered all Ballyporeen.

Now the wtiskey went round, and the songsters did roar, 
Tim sung g
i'll'add4 O'Kelly," Nell sung " Molly Astore;" 
Till a 
motion was made that their songs they'd forsake, 
Arid each lad take his sweetheart their trotters .to shake: 
Then the piper and couples advancing, 
Pumps, brogues, and bare feet fell a-prancing; 
Such piping, such figuring, and dancing, 
Was ne'er known at Ballyporeen. 
Now to Patrick the bridegroom, and Oonagh the bride, 
Let the harp of Old Ireland be sounded with pride, 
And to all the brave guests, young or old, gay or green. 
Drunk or sober, that jigged it at Ballyporeen I 
And when Cupid shall lend you his wherry, 
To trip o'er the conjugal ferry, 
I 
wish you may be half so merry

each

BETSEY BAKES. 
At church I 
met her, dressed so neat, one Sunday in hot 
weather, 
With love I 
found my heart did beat, as we sung psalms 
together: 
So piously she lung her head, and while her voice did 
shake—ah 
I thought if ever I 
did wed, ' twould be with Betsey 
Baker. 
From her side I 
could not budge, and sure I 
thought no 
harm on't, 
My elbow then she gave a 
nudge, and bade me mind the 
garment; 
When church Was over on she walked, but I 
did overtake 
her; 
Determined I 
would not be baulked, I 
spoke to Betsey 
Baker. 
Her manners were genteel and cool; I 
found, on conver-
sation,• 
She'd just come from boarding-school, and finished her 
• education: 
But love made me speak out quite free—says I, " I've 
many an acre, 
Will you give me your company?"—" I shan't!" said 
Betsey Baker. 
All my entreaties she did slight, and I 
was forced to leave 
her; 
I 
got no sleep all that there night, for love had brought a 
fever. 
The doctor came, he smelt his cane, with long face like a 
Quaker; 
Said he, " Young man, pray where's thy pain?" 
Said I, 
"Sir, Betsey Baker." 
Because I 
was not bad enough, he bolused and he pilled 
me. 
And if I 
had taken all his stuff; I 
think it must ha' killed

But meantime she got acquainted wi' a

If she would have him, he did say, a 
lady he would make 
her; 
He gammoned her to run away, and I 
lost Betsey Baker. 
I 
fretted very much to find my hopes of love so undone, 
And mother thought 'twould ease my mind if I 
came up 
to London; 
But though I 
strive another way, in'y thoughts will ne'er

yellow one, the second was blue, 
And the third was a 
green one to the view: 
So off they set with their merry hums, 
In search of sugar and of plums. 
But they too saucy were, by half— 
I 
can't sing if you do laugh; 
So shut your mouths, and list to me, 
Tiddle liddle lol, and tiddle fiddle lee, 
And take a 
lesson from a 
fly— 
Don't give way to lux-u-ry. 
They had not got far when the yellow one cries, 
"Look down, my boys! a 
dinner I 
spies." 
But the bluebottle answered, " Upon my word, 
I 
see nothing but a 
large dead bird." 
" 
A dead bird? well, there's good in that--
I'm sure it looks moustracious fat;

If I

But the others too dainty were by half—

Away then flew the other two, 
Jacky Green and Tommy Blue; 
They flowed on fast, and did not stop • 
Till they came opposite to a 
butcher's shop. 
"Oh, oh," says the bluebottle, " here's a 
treat! 
I'm particularly fond of butcher's meat." 
Says t'other, says he, " Then off I 
go, 
For I 
don't care for meat, you know." 
But he too dainty was by half— 
, 
I 
can't sing, etc. 
Far off then by himself he flowed, 
- 
And into a 
grocer's shop he goed; 
And there he played some saucy rigs, 
For he danced among the sugar, and the plums, and 
the figs. 
The day being hot, he took a 
whim, 
And thought in some treacle he should like to swim; 
So, without considering consequences. in he goes, 
And didn't even stop to take off his clothes! 
But the treacle he found too thick by half--
I 
can't sing, etc. 
The other two passed by the door, 
And heard a 
voice they'd heard before; 
So nearer to the sound they got, 
Till they 'lighted on the treacle-pot. 
There they saw him almost dead, 
And thus to him the bluebottle said: 
"0 Greeny, all our powers can't save ye, 
You'd better have had our beef and gravy; 
But you too dainty were by half"— 
I 
can't sing, etc.

Her brother Ted was standing by, 
Who nately blacked her father's eye, 
For he was bold and frisky; 
Yet through the bogs this was the cry: 
"Ireland expects you won't be shy, 
But die for love and whiskey!" 
The whiskey now went round, 
While hundreds decked the ground, 
With many a 
broken crown; 
Then Judy, danger mocking,

To knock the divils down: 
She beat Tim Connor o'er the sconce, 
Floored Dirty Dick and Joe at once,

Two gamecocks lived in Westminster, one black, the other

So every morning to her roost these rivals went to woo, - 
And roused her from her pleasant dreams with i`

Little hens love little cocks, because they're bold and 
tough, ' 
But for one little tender hen one little cock's enough; 
So, though she liked the brown cock's shape, his manners, 
*and his hue, 
The black cock was her favorite, with his cock-a- doodle 
doo. 
Doodle, doodle, etc. 
No wonder that the black cock and brown cock used to 
fight— 
Miss Hen looked BLACK at the brown cock, though she.was 
lily white; 
At last the jealous brown cock cried, " Black cock, I 
chal-
lenge you, 
To battle for the white hen—death or cock-a- doodle doo I" 
Doodle, doodle, etc. 
The black cock and the brown cock met, the white hen 
stood to view: 
The rival cocks fought furiously, and out their feathers 
flew— 
They pecked and spurred; and spurred and pecked, and 
blood like butchers drew; 
Till the brown cock killed the black cock, and crowed,

And died, while loud the dunghill cock crowed, " Cock-a-

Now, cocks and hens, remember, when you together flock

As sung by ROUES! M AGUIRE. 
A 
IR—" Lord Cathcart." 
'TN a 
very queer thing I'm going to sing, 
As you'll find ere I 
come to a 
close; 
Whether mankind, all thOse who are blind, 
Are the better or worse for a 
nose. 
I've bothered my brains, and taken great pains, 
To grapple each thought as it rose; 
And now, as you'll find, I 
have made up my mind, 
A man is a 
gainer by losing his nose. 
A good reason is here—it makes him see clear, 
At least so I 
think and suppose, 
As, if he is wise, he'll go by his eyes, 
For he never can follow his nose. 
4 
CHAPTilili ON NOUS. 
He bears without rout the loss of his snout, 
It does not exempt him from woes, 
But into the cares of his neighbors' affairs 
He ne'er can be poking his nose; 
And though in his dress he cannot do less 
Than wear, just like other folks, clothes, 
Pocket-handkerchiefs he does without, and we see 
There's a 
saving in soap, for he O'er blows his nose; 
And to say it I'm bold, if he catches a 
cold, 
By winds, by rains, or by snows, , 
He may' make his heart 
glad, for thoitgli ever so bad, 
He's never stuffed up in the nose. 
He smokes well enough, though he cannot take snuff, 
And when he's inclined for a 
doze, 
He sits in his chair, goes to sleep without care, 
For no one can tickle his nose. 
And further, now, mark, if he runs in the dark, 
Though darkness will many folks pose, 
He may by surprise knock out both his eyes, 
But you know very well that he ean't break his nose. 
Should be drink day and night, and in liquor delight, 
Till he cannot stand up on his toes--
Though his neighbors may say whatever they may, 
They can't say'he's got a 
red nose. 
If he gets a 
nickname, he comes off the same— 
They can't call him " Nosey," he knows; 
And though he is vexed, and by trouble perplexed, 
lie never can bite off his nose! 
And though his false friends, for their own private ends, 
His suspicions may lull to repose, 
Disappointment they'll gain, and find it in vain 
And useless to try to lead him by the nose. 
Nay, more—this is sure, if he's rich or he's poor, 
When ficrhting with five or six foes, 
5). 
He'll bear off the bell, for proud I'm to tell, 
Not one can take him by the nose. 
Perhaps you'd surmise he'll be weak in the eyes, 
But ere blind he entirely goes,

I'VE NOT A SINGLI3 CHANCE. 
Think with what grace he bedecks his odd face, 
With a 
bran span new famous false nose! 
With spectacles on, he looks quite like a 
Don, 
And his head up he tosses and throws; 
His mind to amuse, reads over the news, 
• While all folks admire his astonishing nose. 
He smiles at each scoff, takes his spectacles oft; 
Not minding the " ahs" nor the " ohs;" 
But firmly does stand, puts up his right hand, 
And silently pockets his nose!

He'd load his gun without dread or fear, 
AlthOugh his barrel might be his bier; 
Some ' bacco in the muzzle he'd poke it, 
For his enemies' pipe, and tell 'em to smoke it I 
'T was in, etc. 
Says the parson, " Here's an empty church," 
So closed his book, and out did come; 
He swore he'd ne'er be left in the lurch, 
He'd follow his flock, and follow the drum. 
Like priests of old, in the Holy Land, 
The Saracens beat till they couldn't stand; 
"Our foes," says he, " I'll soon caphoozle 'em— 
I'll beat 'em from Jericho to Jerusalem." 
etc. 
GOING A-SHOOTING, 
As sung by 110TEY M AGUIRE. 
AIR—" King of the Cannibal Islands." 
COME listen to me, one and all, 
I'll tell you what did to me befall, 
Vhen I 
left ray shop in Leadenhall, 
And toddled out a- shooting. 
I 
called upon a 
friend or two, 
To go in style, as gem'men do, 
Our shooting-jackets all vere new, 
Vith pockets made to hold a 
few. 
Our dogs they vere of different kind— 
Spaniels—bulldogs I—never mind, 
Ve'd got one pointer, though 'twas blind, , - 
It had been out a-shooting. 
So valking, talking, all the day, 
And roving o'er the fields so gay, 
I'm sure ve Cockneys have a 
Tay 
Of going out a-shooting. 
So valking, etc. 
Ve valked as fast as ve could tear, 
Until ve got to Brixton—there, 
Oh, crikey!—I saw sich an 'are, 
Vhen ve vent out a-shooting. 
"Just vait a 
bit, my chick," said I; 
"I'll prime my gun, so mind your eye I" 
Vhen, just as I 
vas letting fly, 
I 
fired my ramrod in a 
sty! 
The pigs they all began to roar— 
I 
thought the sow a 
horrid bore, 
For they made me pay a 
pound or more, 
Though ye licensed vere for Shooting. 
So valking, etc. 
Now as ye cursed our awk,ward lucks, 
Old Muggins spied a 
lot of ducks; 
Says he, " I'll clip your'wings, my chucks, 
Now ve've come out a-shooting. 
Those ducks are geese—of vits without, 
In shooting-time to swim about— 
They'll be made game of, not a 
doubt, 
So let us pick a 
good ' un out." ' 
Beneath a 
hedge ye quickly shrank,• 
The ducks into the water sank, 
And ye shot a 
donkey on the bank, 
Vhen ve vent out a-shooting! 
So valking, etc.

MEG OF WAPPING. 
Now getting farther doWn the road, 
Our guns again ye 'b
oan to load, 
For sich a 
lot of birds—I'm blowed, 
Ye came down there for shooting! , 
Our dogs they vere so blamed perwerse, 
Ye vopped ' em, but it made 'em vorse, 
They vouldn't in the voods disperse, 
But vent as slow as any hearse. 
Ye fired a 
random shot or two, 
To see what damage ve could do, 
And ye shot our pointer through and through, 
Vhen ve vent out a-shooting. 
So valking, etc. 
Ye didn't take a 
bit of game, 
Although ve valked till nearly lame, 
So ye thought as how ve'd been to blame, 
By going out a-shooting. 
Just then a 
sportsman coming past— 
A bag was o'er his shoulders cast— 
Ye bought the lot and held 'em fast, 
O'erjoyed to liave some game at last: 
Ye vowed ve'd shot 'em, every one, 
And then to ope the bag begun— 
'Twas filled vith cats l—so ye vere done, 
By going out a-shooting. 
So valking, etc. 
MEG OF WAPPING. 
As sung by RODEY M AGUIRE. 
'TWAS Landlady Meg that made such rare sip, 
Pull away, pull away, my hearties I 
At Wapping she lived, at the sign of the Ship, 
Where tars met in•such jolly parties; 
She'd shine at the play, and she'd jig at the ball, 
All rigged out so gay and so topping; 
For she married six husbands and buried them all, 
Pull away, pull away, pull away, I 
say— 
What d'ye think of my Meg of Wapping? 
MEG OF WAPPING. 
69 
The first was old Bluff, with a 
swinging purse, 
Pull away, pull away, jolly boys! 
He was cast away; says Meg, " Who cares a 
curse? 
As for grieving, why, Lud, that's a 
folly, boys!" 
The second in command was blear-eyed Ned: 
While the surgeon his limb was a-lopping, 
A 
nine-pounder came, and smacked off his head, 
Pull away, pull away, pull away, I 
say— 
Rare news for my Meg of Wapping! 
Then she married to Sam, and Sam loved a 
sup; 
Pull away, pull away, brother 
gToggy Sam got, and the ship it blew up, 
ad Meg had to look for another. 
Th '')urth was bold Ben, who at danger would smile, 
Ti. his courage a 
crocodile stopping, 
Made Lis breakfast on Ben, on the banks of the Nile; 
Pull away, pull away, pull away, I 
say— 
What a 
fortunate Meg of Wapping! 
Stay, who was the fifth? 
Oh, ' twas Dick, so neat; 
Pull away, pull away, so merry I 
And the savages Dick both killed and eat, 
And poor Meg she was forced to take Jerry: 
Death again stood her friend, for, killed in a 
fray, 
He also the grave chanced to pop in. 
So now with my song I 
shall soon do away— 
Pull away, pull away, pull away, belay, 
The sit husband's of Meg of Wapping! 
• 
But I 
did not tell you how she married seven; 
Pull away, pull away, so neatly! 
'Twas honest Tom Trip, and he sent her to heaven, 
And her strong box he rummaged sweetly; 
For Meg growing old, a 
fond dotard she proved, 
And must after a 
boy needs be hopping: 
So she popped off; and Tom, with the girl he loved— 
Pull away, pull away, pull away, I 
say— 
Spent the shiners of Meg of Wapping.

THE CORK LEO. 
THE CORK LEG. 
As sung by EODET MAdLTIEE. 
I'LL tell you a 
tale, without any flam 
In Holland dwelt Mynheer Von Clam, 
Who every morning said, " I 
am 
The richest merchant in Rotterdam." • 
Chorus—Ri too ral loo ral, etc. 
One day he'd stuffed him as full as an egg, 
When a 
poor relation came to beg; • 
But he kicked him out without broaching a 
keg, 
And in kicking him out he broke his own leg. 
Ri too ral loo ma - 
ete. 
A surgeon—the first in his vocation—: 
Came and made a 
long oration; 
He wanted a 
limb for anatomization, 
So finished his jaw by amputation. • 
Ri too ral be ral, etc. 
Said Mynheer, says he, when he'd done his work, 
"By your sharp knife, I 
lose one fork; 
But on two crutches I'll never stalk, 
For I'll have a 
beautiful leg of cork." 
Ri too ral be ral, etc, 
An artist in Rotterdam, 'twould seem, 
Had made cork legs his study and the- 
me; 
Each joint was as strong as an iron beam, 
The springs a 
compound of clockwork and steam. 
Ri too ral loo ral, etc. 
The leg was made and fitted tight, 
Inspection the artist did invite; 
The fine shape gave Mynheer delight, 
As he fixed it on, and screwed it tight. 
Ri too ral loo ral, etc. 
TILLIKINS ANM, HIS DINA. 
He walked through squares, and past each shop, 
Of speed he went to the utmost top; 
Each step he took with a 
bound and a 
hop, 
Till he found his leg he could not stop. 
Ri too ral loo ral, etc. 
Horror and fright were in his face, 
The neighbors thought he was running a 
race! 
He clung to a 
post to stay his pace, 
But the leg remorseless kept up the chase. 
Ri too ral loo ral, etc. 
He called to some men with all his might, 
"Oh, stop me, or I'm murdered quite l" 
But though they heard him aid invite. 
He in less than a 
minute was out of sight. 
Ri too ral be ral, etc. 
He ran o'er 'hill, and dale, and plain; 
To ease his weary bones, he fain 
Did throw himself down, but all in vain— 
The leg got up, and was off again 
Ri too ral loo ral, etc. 
He walked of days and nights a 
score, 
Qf Europe he had made the tour; 
Ite died—but, though he was no more, 
The leg walked on the same as before! 
Ri too ral loo ral, etc. 
In Holland sometimes he comes in sight, 
A 
skeleton on a 
cork leg tight!— 
No cash did the artist's skill requite, 
He never was paid—and it sarved him right. 
Ri too ml loo ral, etc. 
VILLIKINS AND HIS DINA, 
IN 
London's fair city a 
merchant did dwell, 
He had but one daughter, an unkimmon nice young gal: 
Her name it were Dina—just sixteen years old— 
With a 
very large portion of silver at d 
gold. 
Chorus—Singing, Too r 
d 
la loo ral, etc.

VILLIKINS AND HIS DWA., 
• 
As Dina vas a-valkin,g in the gardin one day, 
Her papa he came to her, and thus he did say: 
"Go, dress yourself, Dina, in gorgeous array, 
For I've got you an ' usband, both gallant and gay." 
Singing, Too ral la loo ral, etc. 
"0 papa, 0 
papa 1 
I've not made up my mind, 
And to marry just yet I'm not quite inclined; 
And all my la..ro-e fortin I'll gladly give o'er, 
If you'll,let mer'be single just one year or more." 
Singing, Too ral is loo ra1, etc. 
"Go, go, boldest daughter," the parient replied, 
"If you won't consent for to be this man's bride, 
I'll give all your fortin to the nearest of kin, 
And you shan't reap the benefit of one single pin!" 
Singing, Too ral.la loO ral, etc. 
As Villikins vas a-valking in the gardin one day, 
He spied his dear Dina lying dead on the clear— 
And a 
cup of cold pison was a-15ring by her side, • 
And a 
billet-dux to say that for Villikins she- died. 
Singing, Too ral la be ral, etc. 
He kissed her cold corpis a 
thousand times o'er; 
lie called her his Dina, though she were no more: 
And swallowed the pison like a 
lovier so brave, 
And Villikins and his Dina were bu-ri-ed in one grave. 
Singing, Too ral la loo ral, etc. 
110KIALE. 
Now all ye young ladies, take heed to what I 
say, 
And never, not by no means, your guv'nors disobey; 
Now all ye young men, mind whom ye cast your eyes on, 
Think of Villikins and his Dina, and the cup of cold 
pison. 
Singing, Too ral la loo ral, etc.
