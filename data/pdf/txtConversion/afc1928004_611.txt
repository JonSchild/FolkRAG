DAN McCARTY'S PARTY. 
Words and music by.J. E. M URPHY, of MURPHY & MAGIC. 
Dan McCarty he's a 
man, 
Front dear old Paddy's land, 
A fellow that's full of jollity; 
And wii2re he does reside, 
is over on the east side, 
In a 
tenement house, 
Away up in Avenue C. 
One night he took a 
notion. 
His ideas he put in motion, 
Say's he, I'll have a 
jolly spec, 
His friends he invited all, 
To shake a 
leg at Dan McCarty's party. 
CHonus. 
McCarty, so hearty, 
Jumped onto the floor, 
He excited all the tenants, 
in the tenement with a 
roar; 
Then O'Grady lvith his lady, 
He got up to sing, 
McCarty lept upon his neck, 
And done a 
highland fling. 
• 
When the table it was set, 
'Young Lacey made a 
bet. 
That he could fall upon it, 
And not disturb a 
thing. 
No sooner said than done, 
Oh, you never saw such fun, . _ _ 
To see him fall and make the dishes ring; 
McCarty got so excited, 
And young Dasey he invited, 
To come outside and have a 
round or two; 
Some fellow shouted Mick Dasey threw a 
brick, 
Which laid McCarty out upon the floor.

Words and -Music by J. 
E. 
MURPHY, of MURPHY & MACK. 
I 
love a 
pretty little maiden, 
She's the beauty of all I 
know, 
And she'll be mine forever more 
To-day she told me so. 
She's as pretty as a 
rose 
That just begins to bloom, 
About six months from this very day 
I 
will be a 
groom. 
CIIORUS. 
She's as pretty as a 
gooseberry blossom 
That in the garden does grow, 
And she'll be mine forever more, 
To-day she told me so. 
Then we will be married, 
So happy we will be, 
We'll have a 
farm and horses 
And babies on our knee; 
And when my daily toil is over 
To my home I'll run, 
For there with joy and happiness, 
Pure and innocent fun. 
She's as pretty, etc.

Words and Music by J. E. MURPHY, of MURPHY & MACK. 
One pleasant moonlight evening, 
'Some lady friends of mine 
Gave a

You could fill your glasses up, 
If you made a 
call you were welcome all 
At the moonlight picnic.

And plead illy pants; 
He was there with the lovely Mary, 
Who on his arm did hang, 
Vhe dressed so neat and looked so sweet 
At the moonlight picnic.

When we derides used to gather round de door, 
: - 
When dey used to dance and sing and play do old ban)°, 
But, alas, I 
can not play it any more. 
De hinges dey got rusty, and de chimney has fallen down, 
And de roof lets in de sunshine and de rain; 
But de only friend dat's left me is dat good old wife of mine,1 
in dat little old log cabin in de lane. 
(Both sing chorus as before.) 
(Both sing.) 
De foot path now is covered on dat road round de hill, 
And de fences am all going to decay; 
And de creek is all dried up where we used to go to mill, 
De time has turned its course de other way. 
But we ain't got time to stay, and what little time we get 
And we'll try and be contented while we remain, 
Till death shall call my wife and me to find a 
better home, , 
Than the little old log cabin in de lane.

You may talk about your picnics, 
That go so far away; 
Off to Coney Island, 
Or else to Rockaway. 
There is nothing suits me better, 
When the breeze would do you good, 
As to spend a 
moonlight evening, 
Up at Jones' Wood. 
CHORUS. 
It's there the pretty girls you'll see, 
Waltzing all around; 
Oh, my lovely Sally, 
I'll never leave this town. 
I'll take you in the evening, 
When the breeze would do you good, 
And 
hug you and I'll kiss you, 
Up at Jones' Wood. 
I'll ask you, lovely Sally, 
If you will be my bride; 
We will wander arm-in-arni, love, 
By the lone East River side. 
It's then I'll await your answer, 
And be it bad or good, 
And I'll hug you and I'll kiss you, 
Up at Jones' Wood.

THE DANCE AT BATTERY PARK.

"The Wedding Day." 
filloac and words copyright, 1879, and published by E. H. IfeaDINO, 
229 Bowery, N. Y. 
For fun, for sport and merriment, 
After working hard all day, 
Go down to the Battery, that's the place 
To drive dull care away. 
They have a 
band of music there, 
Where the boys and girls have a 
lark, 
It's better than Newport or Long Branch, 
The dance at Battery Park. 
Cuonus. 
You'd split your sides a 
laughing 
To hear Crook's Concert Band, 
The boys play concertinas, 
And the girls they look so grand; 
They dance around like fairies, 
And then commence to spark, 
It's better than Newport or Long Branch, 
The dance at Battery Park. 
You never saw such a 
happier lot 
In the course of all your life, 
Young men of twenty with their girls, 
The workingman and his wife. 
They're happy as if they were kings and queens, 
They're bound to have a 
lark, 
Would set you wild, the music would, 
The dance at Battery Park. 
All classes are represented there 
Every Tuesday and Friday nights, 
The best of order is maintained 
And not a 
single fight. 
It is always crowded, yes, 
From six till after dark, 
The pivoters and spielers are always there, 
To dance at Battery Park. 
MARY THE WALKER. 
Written expressly for Warily and 31AcK by FRANK E. 31cNisti. 
Ant,—Biddy the Ballet Girl. 
I 
am in love with a 
bouncing fat girl, 
Who is known all over creation; 
She beats the life out of Harrigan's Mary Ann, 
Or Dr. Landis for a 
good education; 
A masher she is called on the street, 
In the " Black Crook" she does the statues; 
But lately she has canceled all date's, 
And is off her nut on walking matches. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, her front name she says it is Mary, 
And she is a 
bouncing fat fairy, 
It is no use to talk, she's a 
daisy to walk, 
She has the score- board all marked with long streaks 
of chalk. 
As around on the track she goes creeping, 
And time to the music keeps beating, 
The men they all shout, " Give it up, you're too 
stout!" 
But Mary sticks out to the finis. 
Next Monday night she starts out 
To try and beat Ilarriman and Ennis, 
And if they don't do better than before, 
I'm sure that their names will be Dennis. 
Next season she goes out with me, 
Then I'll be as proud as a 
lord, 
No danger of my trunk's getting stuck, 
For Mary'll wulk off with the board. 
Oh, her front name, etc.

We hope you won't get offended, 
For what we say and do that day

And before its night we are kicked out

And the rosy Irish lasses so enchanting, 
And the merry happy dances we had upon the floor,

There's a 
land that's in this "world, my boys, 
We're praying bard to see, 
And we hope it won't be very long 
Before that she is free. 
For her rivers, her hills and her valleys 
Are so beautiful and grand, 
We would like to go back home again 
To our own dear native land.

In all the festive glory 
Of gay flags and banners bright, 
The merry picnic barge is drifting, 
Thro' the starry night; 
And borne across the waters 
Come sounds of music sweet, 
And merry laugh, and joyous shout, 
And pat of tripping feet, oh! 
Cnonus. 
On the picnic barge they dance, 
In.the moonlight soft they dance, 
Down the river gliding free, 
To rich music's melody; 
'Round the deck the merry feet, 
In a 
jolly measure beat, 
Whirl and glide, a4 down with the tide, 
On the barge they lightly dance. 
A 
vision of rare beauty, 
Floating gently down the stream, 
Thro' plashing waters silvered 
By each brilliant moonlight beam. 
A time for joy and pleasure, 
For merry dance and song, 
A time to tell love's sweetest story, 
While we drift along: 
On the picnic barge, et-

Original by MURPHY and MAca. 
We've just come down here for to sing you a 
song, 
And we tell you we're not going to keep you too long; 
If you think that we are, you'll see that's where you

All over Cork county. to Limerick and back, 
We're known as the wild lrizth rovers. 
We traveled to Connaught, from that to Tyrcine, 
And we walked all the way to the bridge of Athlone, 
Through Dublin and Kerry and Wexfod alone, 
We roamed all around through the clover. 
We sailed over to Prance, from that into Spain, 
And we're going to America by the next train: 
So we'll bid you good-bye, but we'll comeback apP' 
And well still be the wild Irish rovers.

THE WILD IRISH ROVERS. 
Original by 3IttaPHY and 31.4.ca. 
We've just come down here for to sing you a on 
And we tell you we're not going to keep you too long; 
If you think that we are, you'll see that's where you 
are wrong, 
For we have to go home in the morning. 
My name is Tim Doolan—and my name is Pat, 
If you want to see dancing, just stand out of that. 
We're both 
boys, from the crowns of our hats, 
And old Ireland is the land we were born in.

For we're the boys ti-se shillelah to whack, (
Break) 
All over Cork county. to Limerick and back, 
We're known as the wild 11.1.AI rovers. 
We traveled to Connaught, from that to Ty roue, 
And we walked all the way to the bridge of Athlone, 
Through Dublin and Kerry and Wexicrd alone, 
We roamed all around through the clover. 
We sailed over to France, from that into Spain, 
And we're going to Aulrica by the next train: 
So we'll bid you good-bye, but we'll comeback again, 
And well still be the wild Irish rovers. 
For we're the boys, eta.

I 
know you'll have pity 
When you bear what I 
say, 
The way I've been treated 
By the blackguards each day, 
Who stand around the corners 
As I 
pass them by; 
You can hear them say plainly, 
Arrah, stag the old guy. 
CHORUS. 
For they yell out, you terrier, 
Go shoot that hat quick, 
Por they call me a 
chaw 
And a 
flannel mouth Mick. 
The other day, while out walking, 
I 
went down the street, 
A charming young damsel 
I 
did chance to meet. 
Says I, you look charming, 
A cushla ma vick; 
Says she, go drop on yourself, • 
You ould flannel mouth Mick. 
For they yell out, etc. 
When election day comes 
Shure I 
know what they'll say, 
It will be, Mr. McGinnis, 
How are you to-day? 
They'll hand me a

Say, go vote, it now, quick; 
I'm a 
gentleman then, 
And no flitmel. mouth Mick.

That go where`er I

So many queer remarks I

About me ev'ry day;

Does it live, do you know? or is it a

Did it blow out, or did it grow out? 
Oh! for heaven's sake, what is it? 
'Twas in the park, a 
lively mob 
At me did talk and stare, 
"I wonder if it's loaded, 
And if that's all its own hair." 
" 
It lives, it breathes," one chap did say, 
"It's pulse is all serene,"

They ask how lone I 
walked alone, 
And say " when were you canned?" 
And hint I'd look much better, 
If upon my head I'd stand;

OHN MURPHY. 
George and John Murphy stayed out a 
whole night, 
And the truth is they drank too much beer 
Arid when they got home they both were so tight, 
That both of their heads felt quite queer. 
"Let's sit down and rest ourselves," George said to 
John 
"
,Let's try and recollect where we've been ;" 
So they sat down, but, oh, in a 
minute or two, 
They were asleep and beginning to dream. 
Plow dreaming is funny—your mind wanders away— 
Some dream they are a 
king, some a 
goat; 
Why I 
dreamt Cother night, peculiar to say, 
I 
was an engine on the elevated railroad. 
But the Murphys they dreamed that in Paris they 
were, 
Looking for a 
first-class hotel, 
In their valises was gold, but how it got there 
Neither of the Murphys could tell. 
Continued. 
They dreamt George was a Dutchman, and that hi:, 
name was Jake, 
With his clothes tore, and bald-headed at that, 
nit John was an Irishman, and from jail he di4 
break, 
That his hatn - wasn't John, but was Pat; 
Among lunatics surely they thought that they were, 
Who they tried to kill, strange it did seem 
That they were arrested and caught in a 
snare, 
This the Murphys all saw in a 
dream. 
They dreamt to the gallows they both had to go, a..! 
their sentence was they had to die ; 
That 
they mounted the 
scafflid, John quickly. 
George slow, and that neither attempted to cry. 
They dr,-aait that hanging them wasn't vevere, 
Bat imagined that it would cause I 
,ts of fun ; 
Thit the spldiers and sherin all stood ouite near, 
To maic.e sure that the murderers were hung ; 
They dr3aiht that the trap !'ell 
and that they wer€ 
de•td, how str.tuge the s - usation dill seem, 
But the truth was the beer had pot into their heads, 
and caused such a 
ridiculous dream.

TALMAGE'S VISIT TO ENGLAND.

my ditty, 
I'll sing to you of " Brother Tahnage" leaving this 
great city. 
[Symphony.] 
He went across the briny sea to convert those Eng-
lish sinners, 
To eat plum pudding and fat roast beef at Johnny 
Bull's big dinners. 
Oh, I 
went down to see him off, the day that he went 
sailing, 
He looked like the captain of a clamsoup-boat, a-
going out a- whaling. 
[Symphony.] 
Says he "Good-bye, now, Jim, old boy, don't drink 
too much cold water, 
I'll show the ' Dark Side of New York,' to Johnny-
Bull for a ' corker.' " 
He spouted like a big sperm whale to the sailors, 
while crossing the ocean, 
And when he arrived in London town he set it in 
commotion. 
[Symphony.] 
When he oprmied his mouth and began to yell with 
a " forty horse-power" praying, 
lie drowned the noise of the big church-bell, and the 
donkeys all stopped braying. 
(Co !zeta d 
Oh, he twisted his legs around his neck, and he yelled 
like a 
wild hyena, 
Says he " the country's full of sin, and, you bet, I'm 
bound to clean her." 
[Symphony. I 
He rolled up his eyes like a 
dying calf, screwed his 
mout h 
up like a 
button, 
And he says, " You bet, I 
ain't no slouch though I 
eat green peas and mutton." 
He stood in the pulpit on his head, throw'd a 
nip-
flap over the organ, 
And he played a 
tune with his two big t 
oes would 
astonish " Johnny Morgan ;" 
[Symphony.] 
He roared like a lion broke loose from his cage, at 
the sinners there before him, 
And he done a " break- neck " song and dance, and 
the deacons all encored him. 
Oh, when he comes back to .New York town, to see 
him we'll be " b'ilin'," 
We'll take him a trip in a 
Government ship way 
down to Coney Island. 
[Symphony.] 
We'll let him preach to the clams on the beach, and 
;3et the fish in motion, 
And we'll take him up in the " big balloon," and 
drop him into the ocean.

Now let ye stand from under, and open wide your

rs;•elate the history of the Sligo liusker(-ers. 
When first we landed on this soil, out West we had 
to go, 
For to work vivin canaling in the state of Oln•bo; 
And when the war it did break out, they to( 
k our 
jobs a 
way, 
So we organized a 
company, mid :Anted for the fray. 
We fous2:!it the wild red Indian braves for many a 
weary day: 
But they couldn't beat the Sligo Musketeers. 
Ch oitus. 
With me ha, ha, 
the plain, 
And Inany it Aveary day we thought we'd never see 
home again; 
The Indian 
fought like blazes, but their fighting 
WaS hi 
For they couldn't down the Sligo Musketeers. 
ha, foot straw, we marched across 
We fought with Banks and Burnside, with Grant 
we. took a 
hack; 
But best of all though he was small, was gallant lit-
tle Mae; 
And if they'd let him have his way, the enemy he'd 
drive back. 
With the assistance of the Sligo Musketeers, 
For he knew how to engineer, and likewise take 
command, 
No matter what your station was, ho'd fake you by 
the hand. 
He li. ,oked so noble on his horse when he was in com-
mand, 
Of us fighting boys, the Sligo Musketeers. 
With me ha, ha, ha, etc. 
As sung with treat success by 'roily Pastor. 
Mrs Crown she had a 
daughter whose age was seventeen or 
Two young men they came to court her, one was rich the 
ether poor. 
The s, oung girl seemed to love the latter, the mother knew 
this would not pay, 
Sc. 
said, I'll end the matter, and to the daughter she did 
toty : 
E...cruN.—Now, my 
girl, I 
want you to think the matter over 
Fvviou.; to marrying either of these young gentlemen. I 
want yoa to imagine these two purses to be your two lovers. 
One is cvton, the other wool—one is empty, the other full. 
esnd holdn.g a 
purse in either hand she said: 
CHORUS. 
Think of thi.J, kink of that, which one will you have, my 
honey? 
One, you see, is suite empty; the other one is full of money. 
Think of this, tUnIc of that; one is cotton the other wool— 
If I 
were you, thitween the two, I 
should have the one that's

V^ THINK OF THAT.—(Concluded.i 
With this you can liar\ lots of pleasure, a 
carriage waiting

To ride about, is, at sseur leisure. 
With this you will be 
always poor. 
Love's a 
thing you canno,. live on; that \yin not last long, I'm 
sure— 
When povarts comes in at the window love it flies out at the 
door.

But he, of course, must be fc.otten, if the other you should 
have me wed. 
Though poor, I'm sure, wa slOd hr happy; but you, of

The mother said, " Don't bE a

girl did say: 
Think of tbie, think of that, obl. 
On the morning the daughter was to marry the wealthy man 
a 
note was found, 
The mother read it, did not tarry, arid when she searched the 
country round,

SAID THE POT TO THE KETTLE. 
Sung with grt:at aee 
7,y 
You have heard of the pot aml the kettle, 
how each called the other one black, 
Though both wore so sooty, of grace and of beauty 
Each thought that it nwhing did lack. 
When the light was put out in the kitchen, 
And all the good folks were in bed, 
The pot and t1i 
kettle wer. put on their "' nettle, 
And these are SOjUC things that they said: 
Said the pot: " There's a 
new style of bonnet . 
That looks like the side of a 
hill; 
Behind one ' tis certain you can't see the curtain 
When ladies the theatre fill." 
Said the kettle: " You men are not perfect, 
For after each act you sneak out 
For sherry and bitters, and leave us poor ' critters' 
For sale, while for cocktails you shout!" 
Said the kettle: " They make big collection3 
in churches, each Sunday, I 
hear: 
While poor folks are sighing, in wretchedness dying, 
Now, where these stamps go. it is queer." 
Said the pot : " They are sent to the heathen 
To purchase theta toothpicks and citke; 
And the well-preserved preachers, can't see the poor 
creatures 
That throu,;l1 our streets shiver and shake!" 
&ill the pot: " Now the mistress is wearing 
That wonderful thing called a bang;' 
The girk in the kitchen, nil look quite bewitching, 
For wearine- 
it thoy've got the hang.'' 
Said the •• 
-You're right, 't 
was but latelg 
I 
heard of alt :1

--eident rash— 
At table. a 
boarder created disorder 
By aiding a • bang in his ha:ill" 
(Concluded.) 
Said the kettle; " Some clubs where a 
lady 
May lounge in, the same as a 
swell, 
Are getting in use, now, what's ' same for the goose, 
TIOW, 
Is sause for the gander as well.'" 
Said the pot: " Who will now nurse the babies 
If women to clubs off will roam? 
Now, with my best respects for the delicate fie.; 
A 
woman's best club is her home." 
Said the pot: " Noodle Snooks met a 
widow, 
'Twas at a 
grand ball of the 
ton;' 
Iler bust was perfection, likewise her complexion, 
A 
bushel of gems she had on 
Said the kettle: '' I 
heard that her figure 
And diamonds were 
snide,' nothing real. 
She snatched Snooks bald-headed, and now they are 
wedded, 
She looks like the ghost of an eel!" 
Said the kettle: " In Central Park lately 
The sport was delightfully fine, 
While lovers were skating, the ice they were bzeakinz, 
And. spooned in a 
manner divine!" 
Said the pot: " It's no wonder the ladies 
Don't scream, now, whenever they fall, 
That new patent bustle— it don't even rustle— 
Bat bounces them up like a 
ball!"

SHUCKING OF THE CORN. 
Written and sung by DAN O'BRIEN, Banjoist. 
Oh pity the fate of a 
poor old colored man, 
Whose heart is so sad and forlorn ; 
For I've wandered far away frau good old Alabam, 
And the fittle brown cot where I 
was born. 
011 I 
never can forget the old plantation, 
Nor the folks in the big house on the lawn ; 
Nor the darkies joyous tones, the fiddle and the bones 
And our frolics at the shucking of the corn. 
Cnoitus. 
Is you gwine to the shucking, gwine to the shucking, 
Is you gwine to the shucking of the corn. 
(Repeat.) 
Oh but times they have altered in good old Alabani, 
Tiw darkies now am scattered far and wide 
And strangers have come to the old plantation now, 
That once was our joy and pride. 
Never more will we hear the darkies singing, 
Cuing to their labor in the morn ; 
No more will we hear the banjo and the Bones, 
Making music at the shucking of the corn. 
Old Massa and old 141issus dey both am dead and 
gone, • 
To that bright and huppy home beyond the sky ; 
Ansl this poor old colored man he soon will follow 
them, 
Ti meet them in the sweet by-and-by. 
-
flut still ill struggle on with resignation 
And wait till old Gabriel so aids his horn 
Then I'll bid good-bye to the dear old o-intly South, 
tine: they'll miss me at the shucking of the corn. 
Is you gwine, etc.

STRIKE WHITT '
PRE 
ON IS HOT. 
Words and music by DAN Driscor..L. 
My subject I 
take from a 
maxim well known, 
From which all a 
lesson can learn, 
To waste not a 
chance one may have to do right, 
Nor let opportunities turn; 
Although there are many in this world to-day 
Who wealthy might be, were it not 
That each chance they'd receive they always would fall 
To strike while the iron was hot. 
CHORUS. 
So, boys, don't forget it, and heed what I 
say, 
No matter whate'er be your lot, 
Make hay while the sun shines, you'll find it will pay, 
And strike while the iron is hot. 
We'll say there's a 
young man in love with a 
girl, 
He frequently calls at her Ironic; 
He swears that lie worships the ground that she treads 
Wherever, perchance, she may roam; 
He's bashful, perhap-;, and he fails to propose, 
Lets chances slip out of his hold: 
At last he discoveri, although it's too late, 
That he's letting the iron grow cold. 
You've heard of those men who are now dead and gone, 
Jim Fisk, A. T. Stewart, Bill Tweed, 
And Vanderbilt, John Jacob Astor, and more, 
Though mention them hardly I 
need. 
As boys they began at the foot of the steps, 
And gradually higher they got; 
They ascended from poverty to great wealth, 
For they struck while the iron was hot. 
Again, there's Napoleon and Frederick the Great, 
And, most of all, George Washington, 
Vho conqtnered great nations, and showed to the 
world 
What true, noble courage laid done. 
By strong p.‘rseveeanee and knowledge combined, 
They scattered the foe like a 
shot; 
„Whey proved themselves heroes, and simply because 
... 'They szruck while the iron was hot.

SOLD, SOLD EVERYWHERE. 
Written by H ARRY KkaNri.I., anti sung by 1.)::NNts K EARNEY, 
24 nights at the St. Carlei Theatre, Nw Orleans, with 
geat success. 
Oh, I 
am an Irishman, 
From Ireland I 
came ; 
I 
landed in America 
And here 1 
will remain. 
I 
had to struggle hard at first, 
But I 
don't think that was fair ; 
No matter what I 
tried to do, 
I 
get sold everywhere. 
SPOKSN.—A man can't tell now whetti he goes out if 
he'll ever get home. 
I 
was walking down the street 
the other afternoon, and as I 
leaned up against a tele-
graph pole, someone started the machine, and in ten 
minutes I 
was in Syracuse. 
I 
stayed there until I 
got 
fresh enough to get away, and, then left. 
There is no 
use of anyone taking anything they can't get away 
with, but if you can get sugar for it, take at whether 
you can get away with it or not. 
But wherever I go 
for it, a 
sure thing I 
am 
Cnouns. 
Sold, sold everywhere, alas,. I've bean sold, 
Sold right, sold left, it aie't no use to try ; 
No matter what I 
try to do, 
I 
get sold everywhere. 
I 
went out to the circiP once, 
To see the elephant :jump, 
When a 
monkey bounced out of a 
eagsk

Attention, please, while I 
relate to you, 
Of how I 
met my love ; 
'Twa's in a 
lane, as I 
was walking through, . 
The moon shone bright above. 
A 
lovely maiden, all alone, 
Was walking leis.lrely, 
When I 
made bal to ask this little one 
If she would walk with me. 
Sally Mackenally, 
That is my charmer's name ; 
And she lives up in our alley, 
With her sister Susan Jane. 
CHonts. 
Yes, 'deed I 
do, I 
love Miss Sally — 
(Umpi.), Lots of fun up in our alley, 
Oh, yes she is a 
pretty Itttle girl, 
As ever you did see ; 
Her e-
yes are bright, h.sr teeth are hike the pearl 
That is found down in the sea. 
IdDA'ITCE.) 
I 
took my darling to a 
fancy ball, 
And danced all night mid day ; 
And Sal she was the glyest of them all 
And I 
was just as gay. 
Continued. 
The music played then I 
cut loose, 
The darkies all did bawl, 
They laughed and shouted, give that nigger room, 
And they near broke down the hall. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, she is a 
pretty little girl, 
As ever you did see ; 
Her eyes are bright, her teeth are like the pearl 
That's found down in the sea. 
I 
jut saw Sal. 
011, my 
She's my gal. 
Is that so ? 
She loves me. 
You bet, 
yes, incleedy, honey, and we're gwine to meet to-night. 
DUET. — Down upon the flowery meadow, 
When the moon shines bright ; 
Rambling in the twilight shadows, 
With my love to- night. 
(Repeat.) 
Sal loves me. 
Oh, my ! 
She's all mine. 
Give us room, 
She's my pie. 
Oh, 1211 die, 
Yes, indeedy honey, and we're gwine to meet te-night.

The stars were twinkling o'er the lake 
One lovely summer night; 
I 
heard the wavelets gently break 
In music sweet and light. 
But fairer than each silver star, 
The eyes that sought my own! 
Oh, meeting there was sweeter far. 
Than rowing all alone! 
Cnonus. 
Dip, dip, our oars we bent amid the spray so bright; 
O'er the tide how sweet to glide rowing in the starlight. 
!Jip, dip, our oars we bent amid the spray so bright. 
Eeopilig time to musie's chime rowing in the starlight. 
'Twas like a 
lovely fairy dream; , 
We fondly lingered there; 
Until that hour I 
did not deem, 
That earth held scenes so fair. 
The stars were watching us we knew, 
But would never tell; 
Sweet words were spoken kind and true, 
By lips I 
loved so Nvell! 
Dip, dip, etor 
Ths night was fading fast away, 
The parting hour drew near; 
How sweet could we forever stay, 
'Mid scenes so bright and dear! 
But, oh, my heart shall never tell, 
What loving lips replied, 
When asked that we thro' life might sail, 
Forever side by side! 
Dip, dip, et. 
OUR SCOTCH LASSIE JEAN. 
Presented to JOILS FIELDS. 
Sting by G. W ILSON. 
On Chatham Street's fair shores, where the sheenys 
keep their stores, 
Bad clothes hangs out when it rains. 
inside the little store, nuntlier fifty -four, 
There lives my girl, they call her Sarah Jane. 
She's been waiting for my coining, you can bet I'll 
make her wait, 
When she sees me won't she raise Cain! 
They say her teeth is false, well. I 
won't argue that, 
So I 
guess I 
will steer of Sarah Jane. 
CHoRus. 
Jane, Jane, Red-headed Jane, 
Give me back my watch and chain, 
They say that your face would unlock a 
door, 
You're my bonny, crop- eyed, big- mouthed Sarah 
Jane. 
One year ago I 
left her, she was Soho Emma's sister, 
She was always singing a 
song called ' Baby Mine." 
She was driving me to drink, so I 
then began to 
think 
I'd leave my sweet .Jane far, far behind. 
She wrote me postal-cards, putting me upon my 
guard, 
That her father intended to kill me, 
So I 
sent her a 
bar of soap and it cut her father's 
throat, 
Now, he's spitting suds for Chinese laundries-ee.

OUR VALIANT KNIGHT PARNELL. 
By PHILIP NORBERT GAFINEY, 
Ohl tell me, brothers, did ye hear, 
The news from o'er the say? 
The landlords all have raised their rint, 
And tinants will not pay. 
Sure brave Parnell is striving hard 
To crush those cruel laws; 
We'll soon be rid of every tax, 
For he upholds our cause. 
CHORUS. 
Then shout hurrah! for the valiant knight, 
Who fights for ips at home: 
May God always direct Min right, 
Wherever he may roam. 
Oh, why does England's noble queen, 
Those tortured peasants crush? 
The thought of such unchristian deeds, 
Should surely make her blush. 
And why does she refuse to hear, 
Their piteous tales of woe? 
Ab surely ' Os her government, 
That makes her treat us so. 
Then shout hurrah, eta. 
If those sassenachs imagine, 
That they can heat us down, 
We'll fight to death; our native flag 
Well plant in ever town; 
As, in days of old, we'll teach them 
That Erin's sons, though few, 
Have pluck enough to stand their ground 
And make their foemen rue!

TIIE PRETTY LITTLE DUCKS. 
Written by HENRY CARNEY. 
Sung by JOHNNY PATTER. 
Z. love ta, roam the bright green fields, 
I 
like to live at a 
farm, 
love to stroll where the primroses grow, 
For a 
country life is a 
charm. 
I 
love to wander through the old farm-yard, 
Round by the old haystack, 
/Ind lis 4-en to the chicks as they cackle, cackle, cackle. 
And the pretty little ducks, quack, quack. 
CHORUS. 
Quack, ouqck, goes the pretty little ducks, 
The h'i's cockle is a 
warning. 
When the old rooster crows. everybody knows 
There's eggs for your breakfast in the morning. 
I 
love to gaze on the r.pe yellow corn, 
I 
love to roll on t! -
-:e 
grass, 
I 
love to romp in the .new mown hay 
Along with a 
pretty country lass. 
I 
love to wander by the old in;11 stream, 
And catch every breeze that blows, 
I 
love to see the lambs as the ramble in the fields, 
In the morning when the rocster crows. 
Qtrielt, quack, eto-
I 
love my home at the little white farm, 
Where the ivy entwines round the door, 
And I 
love to hear the lark as he soars on high, 
And I 
love to hear the old bull roar. 
I 
love to hear the milkmaid's song, 
And listen to the little busy bee; 
Well, you can have your cities and you can have you 
towns, 
But a 
country life for me.
