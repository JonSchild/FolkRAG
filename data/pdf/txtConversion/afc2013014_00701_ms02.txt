Brent Björkman: Today is August 12th—July 12th 2013 and I am with Joy Lyons at her house. 
This is Brent Björkman with the Kentucky Folklife Program and we’re going to talk a little bit 
today about the Library of Congress Park Ranger Occupational Folk Culture project that I am 
about to start. It’s a fellowship—It’s going to be funded through a fellowship from the Library of 
Congress and I was thinking about what type of occupational group I was going to apply for and I 
thought you know what are some of the things in Kentucky that we would like to take a look at. 
Everything really pointed at taking a look at park rangers cause it was nearby; it was something 
that I didn’t think had been talked about too much. When I was trying to conceive of that I asked 
you Joy about what you thought of it and asked for your help in conceiving it and some of the 
elements that would be important to cover when we talked about working in the park. So maybe 
we could begin by talking a little bit about that process and some of the things you think are 
important. 
 
Joy Lyons: Sure. I know that when you first approached me with that topic I was extremely 
excited about it. Especially, since I have been thinking lots of thoughts over the last year or two. 
We’ve got several very important anniversaries coming up within the National Park Service and 
at Mammoth Cave National Park where I have worked for more than 30 years. We’ve got the 
100th anniversary of the National Park Service. One-hundred years in 2016. We’ve got two-
hundred years of guiding cave tours at Mammoth Cave. Of course that pre park service days as 
well. Then we have the 75th anniversary of Mammoth Cave National Park. All of that comes in 
the year 2016. So, it’s a little serendipitous that you came up with this idea right before we really 
got into discussing plans for these anniversaries at Mammoth Cave at the National Park. So, when 
you mentioned it I thought park rangers yes definitely. I am biased. I’ve been one for a long time, 
but I also know that there are so many people out in the United States and other countries who 
don’t understand the role that national park rangers play and how that function can change from 
location to location from region to region and even within a park depending on what district you 
might be in a national park. Mammoth Cave is one of four national park service sites in the state 
of Kentucky. That’s actually quite a few for a state that’s pretty much—I’ll say a medium sized 
state. There are other states that have many more and others that have fewer. So yeah, I was really 
excited to have the whole process aimed toward National Park, National Park rangers and I kind 
of liked it that it would maybe happen before I decided to retire which will be soon.  
 
[00:03:30] 
 
BB: What are the other parks? You mentioned when we were first talking. Mammoth Cave. 
 
JL: Mammoth Cave National Park. There’s Cumberland Gap National Historic Site. Big South 
Fork which is a National Recreation Area. It’s actually Big South Fork National Scenic River I 
think, and then Abraham Lincoln’s birthplace up in Hodgenville. So, those four; two pretty much 
in this part of the state and the other two are in the eastern part of the state, and definitely part of 
what was called the eastern parks movement. All four really were. 
 
[00:04:11] 
 
BB: That means they were created at the same time or? 
 
JL: Well, they all came to—roughly close to each other. I would have to look this up, but I’d 
have to look this up. I think though that Abraham Lincoln’s birthplace was the first one of the 
four. I wouldn’t want to swear to that but I think it was the first of the four to be accepted by 
congress. Yeah.

[00:04:40] 
 
BB: You know coming here to study folklore and being a folklorist in the state you’ve always 
been like a very interesting friend because I was introduced to you as—I guess I was introduced 
to you in the park context but even before then I was (unintelligible) sort of she’s a folklorist as 
well. So, it’s always been…to see how you’ve…the conversations I’ve had with you about how 
folklore and ethnography, and just in your interpretive—the way that you interpret—this may be 
somewhat like a park service person, maybe not, but I’ve always like looked to you like what an 
implacable kind of way to use all of the skills that you have as a folklorist—that you see things 
like a folklorist. Before we maybe talk about the rangering thing can I talk to you a little about 
how you went into the folk studies program? Was it at the same time—were you doing seasonal 
work at the park and then you were? What was your aha moment to be a folklorist? 
 
JL: My aha moment to be—wow. It was actually as an undergraduate. My first folklore class was 
urban folklore with Cam Collins at Western. It was just an eclectic group of people in the class 
and I’m not sure how to describe Camilla Collins, but I’ll say that she grabbed my attention really 
quickly in class. She wound up being a mentor to me and I met a young lady named Teresa or 
Terry Darika who was in the master’s program. She was in that urban folklore class with me and 
we all hit it off. Myself and Terry and a guy named Danny Flex, and another fella named Michael 
Hendrix. We all became really good friends in that class and started socializing. Then we signed 
up for the next class the next semester. I really fell in love with the topic because I wasn’t sure if I 
wanted to major or minor in English or History and I found that the folk studies classes that I was 
taking were hitting on both, but in a more cultural way that I espoused. I like the interworking’s 
of how does a group interact with each other, how do they share things with each other, what’s 
important, how they pass on traditions. So, I really like history, but it wasn’t so much the political 
history as it was the communal history and what made families tick, what made larger groups of 
families tick, and how do they all work together to create a sense of place. I knew in my gut what 
I was interested in. I knew it intuitively. I didn’t know what to call it. Then when I got there into 
the class it was very quick. I realized quickly that I had accidentally fallen into just what I was 
looking for by taking that class. I mean, I found myself learning about ballads and of course 
moonshine. I mean, every genre of things that I’ve ever been interested in was all of a suden 
coming up in class. There are things that you know you want to learn more about, but you do the 
traditionally you tended to learn those things from individuals. You know, how to do something, 
how to make something, how to build I don’t know a dog house. Whatever, but I found out that 
that was the discipline that grabbed me. I continued to take the English class and the American 
history classes and I wound up actually majoring in English with a double minor in history and 
folk studies and it wasn’t until years later that I went back and took some masters classes. That 
was after I was married and had the girls. I had children. It was something that I had put on the 
backburner because my career started and I decided, you know, it’s time to get back into that 
academic realm of folk studies because I was seeing ways I could use it at work and ways I could 
share it with other people on my staff. By then I was already a supervisor. I was supervising other 
people and trying to give them those investigative skills and the research skills. So, I decided that 
it was time for me to go back and pick up a few more classes. 
 
[00:10:05] 
 
BB: How many years was it after you graduated, you and David were together and had the girls, 
and then what was the period of time between undergrad and your graduate? 
 
JL: Eleven years—ten or eleven years later. I had both the girls already. I was in my early thirties 
when I went back. I have to say, I knew at the time that I was going to stick with the National 
	  
4	  
Park Service and I did not go intending not to finish the degree but I wound up deciding not to 
because it just got to the point where I was so busy at work and had risen up the latter at work and 
had the kids. I wound up saying, you know, I’ve already got my career, i'm already doing well, I 
don’t need the master’s degree for money—to make more money, I’m making what I’m making 
and that’s all its gonna be. So, I laid off. I stopped the class work at that time. I did maintain 
friendships and working relationships with pretty much everybody up in the department and 
Lynwood Montel. He was actually...  
 
[00:11:24] 
 
BB: What was your connection with Lynwood? 
 
JL: Well, when I was at Western Lynwood was the department head. The folk studies department 
head. His son Brad and I both were at Western at the same time attending classes. I also worked 
for the department at that time. Charles Guthry, who was an English professor at Western. 
Charley Guthry had been the editor of the Kentucky folklore record. My first year at Western, I 
was his student assistant so I helped him with the Kentucky folklore record. Actually, the fact that 
that little booklet—the professional booklet existed is what caused me to look in the catalog and 
select a folk studies class, because I had been talking to Dr. Guthry. He was editing as a member 
of the English department and I decided I would like to see what that was all about. At that time 
he was really having to scrape to get people to write articles, to submit music or whatever for 
review—anything for review actually. I did all of his correspondence and mail outs and bulk 
mailings and all that sort of thing. That was part of what intrigued me to get over to the building 
next door and take classes up in Gordon Wilson. I hated that staircase by the way. That back 
staircase. After coming up that hill it was adding insult to injury in the summer time. Oh, you 
walk all the way up that hill and then you had those glassed in windows with heat just reflecting 
off of everything. I cussed those stairs many a day. Definitely cussed those stairs. Did you know 
Charles Guthry?  
 
[00:13:28] 
 
BB: I did not. 
 
JL: Yeah, he was married to Vera Guthry who was—I think she was department—but she was—
she was the department head in the library science. They lived on normal drive about were the 
brand new building is right now.  
 
BB: The Gary Randsell building? 
 
JL: Yeah, the Gary Randsell building. That’s exactly were their house used to sit. Yeah, it was a 
nice house. I lived there with them for about a year. They were good people. 
 
[00:14:02] 
 
BB: So, when you were an undergrad had your seasonal or employment started with the park 
service? Did you grow up here? 
 
JL: No, I grew up in Owensboro north of here about 100 miles. So I was a flat lander up on the 
Ohio River. I didn’t actually start working for the park service…I said a few minutes ago that 
Terry Durika and I became—we became roommates and we actually lived over at the—with the 
Guthries at their house. Had a bedroom upstairs that they rented to us and Terry came home one 
	  
5	  
day in 78—end of 1978 with a couple of applications. She said, “I’m applying for a summer 
position with the Park Service”. She said, “I’ve got an extra application you want it”?  I 
remember sitting there thinking “well where is the closest national park to here”? She said with 
total disdain, “Mammoth Cave, of course.” I was like, “oh yeah, I went to Mammoth Cave in the 
seventh grade when we had a field trip from Davis County”. So, I said, “Sure I’ll fill it out”. 
Those applications were horrendous. Those were the days of multiple pages very similar to 
census bureau forms were you had the little bubbles you have to fill in. So you had to—
everything was—or taking your GED. Remember those test pages were you had those little 
bubbles you had to ink it in completely or whatever. Well that’s what we had to fill out. Pages 
and pages were you had to rate yourself on everything from ability to use a chainsaw to 
swimming fifty yards to speaking in front of  a group of one-hundred people. So you had this 
really widespread listing of ever possible task you could think to do for the park service and then 
some. You had to go through and rate yourself as either being completely a moron with it on up 
to being able to teach somebody how to do it, how to instruct. So, of course I was pretty honest 
on my—but I really was. I tried not to make myself look like a moron too much, but a lot of it I’d 
never done before. Then surprisingly quite a bit of it I had. One of the ones that I had done I dealt 
with money a good deal with my previous work. So, I wound up getting a job offer from 
Mammoth Cave National Park to work in the ticket office selling tickets for cave tours my first 
summer. Terry did not get an offer at all which did not set well, because she of course had more 
education. She was working with her master’s degree—or was finishing her master’s degree and 
didn’t get a job offer but I did. So, 1979 that was the year that I went to work for the park service 
in the uniform selling tickets at the mission sixty-six visitor center that we had for fifty years. 
That’s where it all started for me, as a seasonal GS3, now a GS3 ticket seller. It was a great 
summer. Loved it!  It was one of the best summers—probably the best summer of my life 
actually. 
 
BB: Why’s that? 
 
JL: Because of the friendships I made and the connections I made to Kentucky itself. To my own 
home state, the fact that I became an adult realizing that the place where I came from was special 
and was an important place in the country. So, I was just really alive that summer. Made really 
really—some of my friendships were—some of them still last today. Fell in love with the cave, 
met my husband that summer. David was working at Mammoth Cave that summer as a guide and 
we carpooled. Actually there was about ten of us that carpooled form Bowling Green that summer 
and that’s the year I fell in love with him.   
  
[00:19:06] 
 
BB: I was going to ask you. What characters and personalities did you meet that summer? 
David’s one… 
 
JL: I met David. I met obviously the people who hired me. Louis Hutliff, who is still kickin 
today. He’s been retired for about twenty years, but Louis lives here in Park City. I met Rachel 
Wilson who was one of the first women ever to work at Mammoth Cave in the Park Ranger 
series, and oh golly so many people! There were about—I think there were about thirty new 
seasonals that summer and we all went through a week of training together. So, I met people like 
Pam Underwood and Denise Bowls, or Denise Bower excuse me, Kenny Eso, Dan Skeen, and 
Ray Henderson, whose nickname was Rock Henderson. He was a Western Kentucky University 
football player back in the day. (Phone Rings) So there were quite a few people actually that 
remain my friends today, pretty much all of them. With Facebook I reconnected with to most of 
them and that’s been great. We have an annual guide’s picnic that sometimes the old guides will 
	  
6	  
come too and their always invited to it and welcome there, but we also every five years have a 
guide reunion, so a bigger guide’s reunion in the fall and folks will come back from like the early 
sixties, the early fifties. Yeah, it’s amazing the camaraderie that exists within the guide force at 
Mammoth Cave, which of course are park rangers. They continue even across the decades. It’s 
like once a Mammoth Cave guide always a Mammoth Cave guide. 
 
[00:21:20] 
 
BB: So it’s like a small town high school reunion. You know… 
 
JL: It is! 
 
BB: How intimate they are. 
 
JL: Very much so. All the same stories get told over and over again. And you know they’re going 
to tell the story. You know might as well not even ask them not to tell the story. It’s going to 
come out. Everybody has their special story about a special person and do you remember when. 
Everyone knows the story but a specific person has to tell that story cause that’s their story to tell. 
All that goes on as well with reunions and then just acknowledging—it’s kind of our own 
backslapping sort of a party. It’s been going on for two-hundred years you know and one-hundred 
twenty-five years of it was before it was even a national park of guiding and that was all men. 
Matter of fact it was mostly men on up to the nineteen sixties I think. So you have that kind of 
brotherhood that was then infiltrated by women in the nineteen sixties and seventies. By the time 
I came on the picture in 1979 the guys had pretty much accepted the fact that women were there, 
but it was still a testing ground. I was actually pretty quiet, subdued and didn’t cuss at all when I 
started working there. I didn’t stay that way cause I found myself compelled to prove that I could 
stick with them in all things right or wrong. I did it and so it worked out ok for me though. 
 
[23:15] 
 
BB: So these early cohorts you gave a list of the people and working during the day and then you 
would be…at night would you drive back to Bowling Green and do social things together? It 
became a… 
 
JL: Yes it became a very close knit group and what’s really kinda funny about is we would 
sometimes drive all the way back to Bowling Green after work, change clothes real quick, turn 
around and drive all the back to the park for a party at Seasonals. That’s what it’s called 
Seasonals with a capital S because there are three buildings over there that are apartment 
buildings. Each of the three buildings has four apartments in it and that’s were seasonal staff 
would stay. You had two people to each apartment. So basically eight people in each building and 
that was party central for the summer. So you got your usual talkings too about beer bottles left 
out on the stoops and all that good stuff. They had big parties over there, really big parties, 
drunken brawls actually sometimes. Then we would get talked too because quiet hours in the park 
are at ten O’clock and people at the camp ground could actually hear us at Seasonals if we 
weren’t quiet so we had to be really cautious about that sort of thing. 
 
BB: Big bonfires too then or… 
 
JL: At that point no we didn’t. We didn’t have anything over there in the seventies and early 
eighties. We do now at Seasonals. They’ve got were they have a campfire over there now, and 
they’ll gather around the fire and talk about their day—crazy things that happened on tours and 
	  
7	  
crazy things definitely happen on tours. They’ll share stories with each other about visitors and 
just funny things that each other says cause sometimes people will just do something silly or 
funny at work and they sit around and share it at night around the campfire. So then everybody on 
the frontline staff knows everything that goes on but the supervisors don’t really know much of 
anything that goes on because they’re not sitting there around the campfire at night with the other 
folks too much. 
 
[00:25:40] 
 
BB: The supervisors know to keep a way or they are never really invited? 
 
JL: Well, it’s not that we were not invited. We are actually pretty much always invited it’s just 
that well in the past there were a few supervisors who did go over and kinda join in the fun. 
Depending on what the activity was. You know like if you have a potluck meal yeah that’s kind 
of a fun thing to do. You come over, you eat, talk a while, then you leave and then you let them 
have their time afterwards, because my thought as a supervisor, and having been in the front line 
like I was for so long; I know that they need their space, they need the time to vent sometimes. 
You know, just to say out loud, this is what happened, do ya’ll think this was right? Do you think 
that she should really make me do this? Do you think it really matter if I have my hat on walking 
back and forth between my car and the visitor center? Is it really that big a deal? I mean, it’s that 
kind of stuff and it’s the sort of thing that they need to have, an opportunity to get off their chest. 
They do it with each other and plus some of them have their roles that they play within 
conversations like that. I’ll say some of the older seasonals who are retirees and who are role 
models you know gives them the opportunity to step in and maybe explain things to them and 
they do. It’s one thing that works for us rather than—I don’t have to be that heavy all the time. 
Sometimes all I have to do is tell them it would be a better choice for them to change their 
behavior and I’d appreciate it, and then ask someone else to explain to them why so that they 
don’t feel like they are getting undue attention from me. I also tend to—I’m one of those that 
corrects behavior kind of slyly. It tend to introduce things in a joking manner at first and then I’ll 
turn to them   and say I’m joking around this time, but next time you’re going to be going home 
and change your uniform shirt, you know, no wrinkles. We joke and we tease each other and we 
are all pretty laid back, but they’ve learned to tell when I’m serious about something. I learned to 
tell when my supervisors were serious about something. You learn the difference like how far to 
push it. We do have a really strong family atmosphere, very strong family atmosphere. It comes 
into play at the park just as it comes into play within someone’s nuclear family. We each have 
taken on a roll within the group. You know when to be serious and you know when you can just 
kind of goof around with something. It’s a challenge supervising creative people and they are 
very creative people.  
 
[00:29:18] 
 
BB: So, you kind of explained your supervisor style. Do you have a certain person that you’re 
kind of basing that? Was there a supervisor in your past? Was it an amalgamation of maybe like 
several different people you worked with or it’s an organic thing? Is there somebody that you can 
tell me about that was, like yeah that’s where I got that kind of style from? Was there an instance 
where you had a wrinkle in your uniform and you know what I mean? 
 
JL: Actually no, I would say that I am kind of a combination of different people, but not just 
supervisors though, probably family members as well like my own real family members. As far 
as my style I think that I tend to give what I’m comfortable taking myself and I’m more of a 
direct person. I get pretty direct. I’m not real suttle about certain things. I don’t want to hurt 
	  
8	  
people’s feelings, but I’m also not a push over. I take pride, I think in the fact that I’ve always 
been good at reading people and knowing who’s solid and who isn’t quite ready for prime time. 
That has taught me that you can’t treat everyone the same. You have too, at least I had to take the 
time and the trouble to get to know each of them as an individual and interact with each of them 
in a way that works for that person. It takes time to do that. I know that I have a reputation at the 
park for being that way; for taking time with the staff and not just doing across the board rules 
and regs just to say…I’ve had supervisors myself who were like that and they treated everyone 
the same. If they gave one person a day off then they felt that they would have to give everyone a 
day off, and so no one got a day off. You know a requested day off. If they made an allowance for 
special treatment then no one got special treatment. I don’t look at it that way. I look at it as 
building a team of people each of whom has their own skills and talents and each of them has 
their own nitch within our team. In doing that they all have a roll to be proud of because they 
know that they bring a strength to our bunch of people that others don’t bring. So, I tend to take 
those individuals and their skills and give them opportunities to beef those things up. Then I make 
it a point of using them, and I do mean using them, but of allowing them and using them in 
special ways on the job. So if I have certain people who are type a personalities for instance and 
there are a lot of them. You know if they were all vying to be top notch interpreter, top notch cave 
guide and they wanted to be seen as the best cave guide I would have hell to work with. If that’s 
all they could strive toward they would all be wanting the same opportunities. They would all be 
wanting to go to the same courses. They would all be wanting to get the same training were as if I 
got them all doing, you know, like for instance I don’t think everyone on my staff has to be god’s 
gift to interpretation. I want them to all be good, I want them to all be comfortable with it, but I 
want each one of them to have their special place on our staff were they fill a roll that has to be 
done, were they can shine and they can be known as that go to person. So, you know you asked 
me about my past supervisors. I learned that from them that a team is varied and I learned it not 
because of how they did, but because of how they didn’t do it. There wasn’t a lot of creativity or 
thought given to what staff members were going to be allowed to do, instructed to do or just 
groomed for. People talk about the government that people get groomed and their preselected and 
that’s not necessarily true. You don’t have to be a genius to hone in on what people’s strengths 
are. When you see them as a supervisor, at least I felt like that was my job as their supervisor to 
help them first of all recognize their own strengths and second of all see if they were interested in 
pursuing those in their own special way and then finding opportunities for them to do that and 
then celebrating that with when I got a chance. For instance, the other day Dave Spence who is 
one of the permanent guides on staff—Dave can put anything together. He’s so mechanical and 
he’s good with his hands. He’s the guy that can think things through, fix anything and you know 
he’s a cave guide. Is that important for me? Yes, because we have tools of the trade. Dave is one 
of those people who can fix any lantern you put in front of him. We found that out. He was 
comfortable with lanterns; lighting them, taking them apart, putting them back together, telling 
me when we need to buy more, ordering new parts and what have you. I always have called him 
my lantern man for several years now. The other day on eBay, no it was etsy online, I saw a 
couple of old Avon decanters. Small ones, but one was a kerosene lantern like a Deets lantern and 
the other one was a Coleman lantern. They were just empty Avon men’s cologne bottles, but they 
were older they were vintage and I saw them on there and I ordered them. Dave Spence came by 
to see me the other day and gave them to him. I said, “I’ve had these for you for a while. I was 
going to bring them to work to you, but here I thought I wanted to get these for my lantern man 
just to remind you that I appreciate what you do”. It tickled him. I mean it was just nothing big it 
was just something that let him know I was thinking about him and that I appreciate the work that 
he does at the park. There are a lot of stories about the staff like that. People that have their own 
strengths and places within the staff that we can take advantage of and build a really strong unit, a 
strong cadre of employees who don’t feel threatened by each other but depend on each to make it 
work.

[00:38:05] 
 
BB: So other than Dave do you have other examples of people with strengths or who you 
celebrate? 
 
JL: Oh yeah. Oh gosh! Chuck Decroy. Chuck is—he’s my I’ll say A/V guru. He deals with all 
kinds of things when it comes to copying old music or you know like the old cassette tapes. Hard 
to believe I’m saying old cassette tapes, but remember the little cassette tapes were we would 
record each other back in the day. We have a lot of things like that in our collection. In our library 
at work. So Chuck takes old interviews and old documentaries and transfers them to DVD for me 
and things of that nature. He saved a lot of those by doing that for us. VHS I mean all the old 
formats. What’s kind of fun, is he takes—we’ve got some old interviews that were done. The 
CCC boys for instance, people who worked in the CCC at Mammoth Cave. Kelly Lowy Malloy 
did those back in the eighties I think it was. We’ve had all of those copied to DVD—well to CD 
because they were on cassette, but what’s also fun about is Chuck, without being asked, will take 
them and make extra copies and distribute them to family members of those fellas, people who 
are still living or their descendants and made sure they have copies of them. [takes a drink] Sorry, 
I have to take a drink here. 
 
[00:40:00] 
 
BB: Without them having to come forward and ask for them? 
 
JL: Right. They don’t come forward and ask for them. Mostly because they don’t even know 
they exist. So, you may have someone like Mary Jo Veezat who lives in Cave City. Her father 
was Joe Caleeza and he was actually the superintendent at Mammoth Cave many years ago. She 
didn’t realize we had a interview tape with Joe, and Chuck gave her one as a gift, which her 
father’s been gone a long time. So, it meant a tremendous amount to Mary Jo to get that and hear 
her dad’s voice. That was true for many other people as well. To be able to hear your 
grandfather’s voice for the first time and we’re still talking the men. They were the Civilian 
Conservation Corps. We get a lot of satisfaction in doing things like that for our neighbors and 
you know just the park’s constituents. I’m sure we will continue to do that kind of thing over 
there. It’s important to all the guide staff, especially the park ranger to reach out to the 
descendants of the families who lived at Mammoth Cave back before the park service came along 
and also to reach out to descendants of the park service employees. Its 2013, it’s not 1945 
anymore. Time has passed and the National Park Service has been here for a long time. I don’t 
think it’s going to go anywhere and we need the trust and love of the people in the area. I think 
we have it now more than we’ve ever had it before. The trust… 
 
[00:42:00] 
 
BB: How has that changed since you’ve came on the…Can you speak to that a little bit? I mean 
that will be a part of the story I want to get especially about this particular location. When did it 
expand into what it…taking over extra land and is that a history that I can ask you about? 
 
JL: Well you—sure you can ask me about it. You can ask me about it. I mean ill answer. You 
know some things I have not had much experience with because that wasn’t my role at the park. I 
wasn’t one of the people who helped trade property or bring land into the park service, but my 
role as a park ranger was to make overtures we’ll say to the locals and to build relationships and 
to do that through interpretation and through my own behavior. You know, you want to treat 
	  
10	  
people the way you want to be treated at least that’s what I think. So, when I started in 79—at that 
time none of the National Parks were doing a lot of reaching outside of their park boundaries. I 
think science helped us to do that because we started learning more about, for instance in this 
area, karst topography with the limestone caves and what we could learn from the cave system 
here and extrapolate from here to other karst regions in the United States and other countries. So, 
I think that we started making overtures nationally through like UNESCO, which of course, got a 
little political, well was very political, but when you talk about world heritage sites and the fact 
that Mammoth Cave National Park was selected as a world heritage site, and the fact that 
Mammoth Cave National Park became a man in the biosphere site, which gave us national and 
world status as basically a scientific laboratory that the world can learn from. Once that started 
happening we started realizing that we weren’t encapsulated; that we actually are interconnected 
outside the boundaries. Then we wound up needing to educate the public about those 
interconnections and how what they did outside of the parks impacted inside the parks, but also 
what we did inside the park could impact outside the park. We started making friends. We started 
being nice to each other going to meetings and public meetings and not hiding behind I guess the 
green and grey uniform as someone in the area thought we did and actually creating a dialogue. 
That’s what was happening in the 80’s and continued to happen through the 90’s. As 
superintendents came and went at the park you know you see different ideologies and different 
ways of approaching the public and the local communities. Some did better than others. Some 
superintendents—you know there’s always a rumor that each superintendent comes with some 
marching orders that their given some audio tape that self-destructs or something before they 
actually hit the park boundary. I don’t think that that’s quite true, but they have all been very 
different in their demeanor and how they approach local constituencies and the staff for that 
matter how they do that. We right now have our first female superintendent ever. Sarah 
Craighead just came in last November and that’s a new one for us. It’s taken a while but I’ve seen 
quite a few superintendents and I’ve seen some strong superintendents. I’ve seen a few that were 
not so strong. What’s interesting though is I’ve always watched the team of people, the leadership 
team at Mammoth Cave pull together regardless of who the superintendent was because they and 
their staffs new what needed to be done and how it needed to be done and how soon it needed to 
be done. So we would find ways to balance the happiness of the superintendent against or with 
our ability to keep the staff and locals satisfied. I’ll put it that way. Superintendents are powerful 
people within our realm so you wanna keep them happy, but we also have our own knowledge 
that we’ve learned over the years of what works with especially local communities and you don’t 
want to bury—you don’t want to lose ground. You don’t want to lose ground from going from a 
strong superintendent to one that’s maybe not as strong in those areas and wind up having to 
make up ten years later. You want to keep that momentum going even if it means that you may or 
may not be staying on the boss’ good side. 
 
 
[00:47:50] 
 
BB: Well, you’ve seen a pretty much better mentor and projector that’s… 
 
JL: Oh yeah I have. I’ve seen our relationship with all kinds of people improve over the years 
and we don’t want to lose that we want to keep that going. For instance, now there are different 
genres even. It’s not just that you encounter constituents face to face on tours or that you seem 
them at meetings or at meetings at the park. Now you have groups of people who are meeting on 
the internet. I mean now we’re using the internet to share information with each other, 
myfamily.com, there’s several sites that deal with Mammoth Cave descendants and Barren 
County and Edmonson County. There’s a Mammoth Cave guide site and people become 
members on there and they share their thoughts about anything and everything. They post 
	  
11	  
photographs, they share information and they learn so much about each other and we have honed 
friendships online, and then I think that I’ve by my presence on some of those sites I think that 
I’ve raised the trust level of a lot of folks out there between local families and decisions that are 
being made at the park. So all you have to do is be honest with people. Tell them the truth. Tell 
them how you came to a decision, why you came to a decision and welcome their feedback. 
That’s a lot of what we’re doing these days. A lot of our decisions are being put up for public 
response. Sometimes they jump on the bandwagon and sometimes they don’t. We’re a lot more, I 
guess you could say we’re a lot more open about how we do things than we used to be so that’s 
changed through all the superintendents, and when we make a mistake we own up to it. That 
never would have happened four years ago. You know, we look back and we know the park 
service made some major screw ups over the years and we’re sorry for them. I could sit here and 
say, “It wasn’t me, I didn’t do it”, but I still represents the agency that did do it. Even though 
people were thinking differently back then I still feel a responsibility for their actions because I’m 
still a part of that group. I’m proud to be in the National Park Service 
 
[00:50:47] 
 
BB: I think you’re going back to your honesty is the best policy isn’t it? 
 
JL: Yeah it is. I mean, why not? Honesty is a lot easier to cover your tracks when you’re honest. 
Just tell the truth. You don’t have to worry about it so much.  
 
[00:51:04] 
 
BB: So at the reunions that you have sometimes different people attend [?] reunions. Then there’s 
always people that you know are going to tell that story or this story and that sort of thing. What’s 
the story that Joy Lyons tells at these kinds of things? What do people say? Here it comes, or… 
 
JL: Oh, the story that I tell? 
 
BB: Yeah. 
 
JL:  That people [Thinking] The story that people want me to tell is usually one about—is one 
that happened in the cave, huh a long time ago. It happened in the winter of [recalling] the mid 
1980’s. Actually ok, it was like the late 1980’s. I was in the cave with a historic tour group and it 
didn’t trail, and by that I mean that it didn’t have enough people on it for a second ranger to go 
with me. So, that was a good thing because it wasn’t witnessed. When we got into the cave—
when we got into the rotunda, which is where the salt peter works are at the boxes, and then we’d 
go on down to the church, which at that point, some people called it the Methodist church, at that 
point is where we would typically do cave lighting demonstration. We would turn the lights out, 
light a lantern, an old replica of a grease lantern and we’d throw torches, which we hadn’t done 
since 1991. Actually, I take that back, we stopped throwing torches December 31st 1990. That 
was the last day that anyone threw a torch in Mammoth Cave. It was a fella named David 
Alexander who threw the last torch in Mammoth Cave. But um… 
 
BB: And that means that you light a… 
 
JL: Yeah. Well what we would do is we had a long stick usually made out of hickory and it’s 
about three feet long. At the tip of it is, if you can picture a nail with no head to it sort of jammed 
into the end of it. It was a little bit like a pick up stick that you pick up trash with a poke point on 
the end of it. They were always handmade by the local guides. They would always make them 
	  
12	  
themselves (phone rings). I was at the church getting ready to make my lighting demonstration 
and I leaned over in the dirt—I leaned over to pick up a couple of torches. Well, I had the torch 
stick in my hand and when I leaned over—these torches were made out of rag material that we 
used to get from Union Und—well from Fruit of a Loom in Bowling Green. All those scrap t-
shirts, well we would take them and cut them into one inch strips and twist them around like a 
twist of chewing tobacco and you’d wrap the end of it, tie it off and it would look like—well to 
be honest with you it looked like a tampon, kind of just like a plug of chewing tobacco. We 
would soak those in some kind of fuel—kerosene in our days, and each of us was limited to two 
torches that we would stand in the church and throw up high into the darker recesses of the room, 
maybe towards a ledge like the ‘rat’s ledge’ or the ‘eagle’s nest’. So these torch shots had special 
names because, they got names because the guides competed with each other for who could hit 
which torch shot and they were basically rated by difficulty. It was something that the guides did 
for their own pleasure and to outdo each other. So, I got in there that day and I leaned over, was 
talking to the visitors—I had about twenty people with me and as I leaned over I leaned down to 
pick up the torch stick and somehow or other when I leaned with the torch stick and grabbed the 
torch I hooked the nail on the torch stick through the buckle, actually, the underwire on my bra. I 
had somehow it stuck threw the front of my shirt and into a hole I had on my bra where the 
underwire was. So, when I did that and I put the torch on I went to raise up and I couldn’t. I was 
literally like a ninety degree angle to the floor jerking really hard trying to stand up not realizing 
that the torch stick was stuck through my shirt and into the underwire of my bra, and I had this 
nasty kerosene torch stuck to me. So, finally I got that jerked free, stood up, put the torch back on 
the torch stick and threw it. Luckily it hadn’t been lit yet. That would have been pretty bad. It 
would have been rough. So anyway, one of the visitors on the tour came up to me as we were 
walking out of the church on the trail and she said, “did you get that all figured out ok?”. I didn’t 
realize that they had all see what I had done that I was stuck with the torch stick. You kinda had 
to be there, but everybody on staff just thought that was hilarious because the lady who came out 
of the cave decided that she would tell somebody about it. So, I had to describe all that and I had 
to go change my shirt cause I had kerosene all over the front—actually, I had to get rid of the 
shirt cause just wouldn’t come clean. So, that was my big torch stick story. That’s what 
everybody always wanted me to tell was that one, that I tried to light myself up one day on a non-
trailing historic tour with underwire in a bra. 
 
[00:57:28] 
 
BB: I was going to ask you. Wouldn’t you have just not told anybody, but… 
 
JL: I didn’t 
 
BB: the visitor 
 
JL: I wasn’t gonna tell nobody no not at all. Then there’s just lots of funny things that happens to 
people on tours. The first time David ever kissed me was in the cave.  
 
BB: Tell me about that. 
 
JL: It was actually the summer that I was working in the ticket office and the first summer—no 
actually it was in the fall. It was in October cause I was kept on until the fall to work on 
weekends. We were having a slow day and I asked if I could go on a historic tour just to get back 
in the cave and kinda see what was going on as part of my training cause as ticket sellers you 
didn’t get in the cave as much as the guides obviously. The tour that I wanted to go on happened 
to be the one with David Lyons on it of course. That was the one that was the handiest for me to 
	  
13	  
go on. The time worked and actually I just wanted to go because David was gonna be there. He 
was trailing the tour and a fella named Red Langley was guiding it, and at the church, the same 
spot where we do the lighting demonstration, I was walking in the back of the tour with David 
actually and we got up to the light switch where he would turn the lights out so that Red could 
then light his lantern up front and start his lighting demonstration. Red always left the lights out 
for a little while, while he talked to people in the dark, and visitors liked that. They liked to see 
the total darkness. I remember David hit the switch when Red asked him too and we’re standing 
there really close to each other and I sort of sent my elbow over to the left and it hit his arm and 
he said I can’t find you. I remember we both had our flat hats on and he leaned over and kissed 
me at the light switch at the Methodist church in Mammoth Cave October 1979. That was the first 
kiss ever. Yep, and then we walked out the rest of the way behind the tour group all the way out 
of the cave. [giggles] It was sweet. 
 
[00:59:52] 
[End of track 1] 
 
[00:00:00] 
[Track 2]  
 
BB: That’s very sweet. 
 
JL: I was a lot thinner back then. I remember we were coming up the tower on the historic tour 
on that trip and he was walking behind me and telling me that he was calling it the amen corner 
because I was up in front of him going up the steps. He said, I think I like this amen corner back 
here pretty well. Yeah, I was a lot thinner back then.  
 
BB: So do a lot of people—one of the things we talked about in the stories of being in well any 
park—this park because it’s your experience this park—is um relationships that are created and 
marriages resolved and long term relationships resulted and what’s that like for your life, your 
working career and your life in general. 
 
JL: Oh yeah. Well obviously I mean David and I met at Mammoth Cave and we married. I think 
party it’s because shared interests. You know, you go to work in a national park because you do 
tend to have similar ideologies, similar value systems and often similar backgrounds as far as 
education goes. So, that happened with us and oh golly I could name all kinds of people who’ve 
gotten married at—or becoming couples at Mammoth Cave National Park just about the same 
time we did. There was Rich Caldwell and his wife Amy, Amy Gates. They met each other at 
Mammoth Cave in 1980. Vicky Carson, Vicky Thompson and Bobby Carson, Gib Backland and 
Connie Hudson, Brad McDougal and Patty Rochester got married, and Golly, so many since then 
too. Sharon Gantsy and Joe Gantsy, Gary Tally and his wife Martha. There’s just dozens of 
people who either met when they were working for the National Park Service or one was working 
for the park service and the other was working for National Parks Concessions, it’s the hotel, 
which is not the same as the park service, but concessional over there. A number of them recently 
even. So, it’s every decade there have been several weddings come about because they met at 
Mammoth Cave. Maria Scott and Brett Powell, I mean just a lot. Brett Painter sorry, I said Brett 
Powell. Brett Painter and Maria Scott where recent ones. Lots, lots of them. It’s not just at this 
park, I mean that’s true at lots of national parks and then you have the challenge of both working 
for the National Park Service needing to be employed and having a dual career situation. The 
park service, there for a while, was really big on promoting dual careers in the national parks. I 
don’t think it’s quite so much so now and that’s largely because we’ve just lost so many positions 
across the nations in the parks themselves. Our staffs are at a minimal now. A lot of the positions 
	  
14	  
that have been vacated or people have retired or people moved on to another park they’ve just not 
been filled so they’re [?] vacant.  
[00:03:51] 
 
BB: How about the two of you? When you, you know, started your relationship and got married. 
Was it in due time for this promotion of dual people? Did you have a…can you tell me what 
positions you had at the time and how did they morph into what they morphed into? 
 
JL: Sure. I started out as I said a seasonal position. David started out as a seasonal as well. He’s a 
veteran of the Vietnam War, and David was given a permanent—he was awarded I guess a 
permanent position in the fall of 79. It was a GS3 split position which meant that he was a park 
ranger split between interpretation and law enforcement and resources management. At that time 
in the late 70’s all of our resources management, our science was done by the ranger division. So 
the law enforcement rangers also took care of studies, cave protection, all of that sort of thing. 
Truthfully, there wasn’t a lot of it going on. We really at that point, by the late 70’s Mammoth 
Cave had not gotten into what I would consider the science of national parks, and then by the 80’s 
it started moving that way. 
 
[00:05:14] 
 
BB: What do you mean the science of the parks? 
 
JL: Well, by that I mean actually beginning to study specific types of animals, mammals, plants, 
aquatic life, cave entrances, archaeology. There was not much documentation and ongoing 
research going on at the park at all. It had been being done almost completely by outside groups 
like the Cave Research Foundation, CRF or the National Speleological Society, NSS or by 
colleges, local colleges for instance. One that comes to mind, it wasn’t science so much, but 
Gordon Wilson at Western Kentucky University, you know, he came to Mammoth Cave and his 
studies had to do with folk studies, with folklore. 
 
[00:06:15] 
 
BB: So what did he do? Did he interview the local cultural groups? 
 
JL: Right. He was interviewing the local people who had their traditions, their various traditions 
in folkways, food ways, folk medicine, and all sorts of things like that. He was interviewing we’ll 
say, what I would consider first generation people off the park and the last generation on the park. 
So, he was dealing with change you know where people were coming—being —I’ll say just 
being forced out of the park—out of the park land where they were having to move to other areas. 
He was seeing that there was a need to try to save part of their culture because it was being 
dismantled in front of their own eyes basically. So, he was doing that kind of research. Probably 
until the 1960’s no one was doing much real original research, by that I mean academic research 
related to anything on Mammoth Cave. There were people who were interested and they would 
write letters of inquiry wanting to find out if the park had information on Floyd Collins or some 
other Mammoth Cave topic, but no one was really doing what I would consider cutting edge 
research, not natural history, not cultural history really. 
 
[00:07:57] 
 
BB: So the rangers at that time were they just maintaining the status [?]? Making it a safe place 
for visitors?  
	  
15	  
 
JL: Exactly. The park rangers were doing law enforcement, they were writing tickets, they were 
making sure—they were dealing with poaching. They were dealing with lingering habits from 
people who had grown up hunting here in this area, and were still wanting to hunt. They were 
talking with people who were still wanting to dig seng, you know, dig ginseng, and they were 
dealing with people who were frog gigging, taking trees down in the park or whatever. They were 
still dealing with just the basics of law enforcement and making sure people didn’t break into 
caves and scar anything or vandalize or write graffiti. They were doing all those sorts of basic law 
enforcement tasks and working accidents and road kills, accidental dear hits and that sort of thing. 
The guides were guiding. I mean, you were a cave guide, a law enforcement officer or a naturalist 
back then. The naturalists were the ones who led surface hikes and they didn’t necessarily give 
cave tours. As a matter of fact, they saw themselves as being different. The naturalists were 
surface people; the cave guides were underground. They learned the repertoire from each other. 
The naturalists taught each other about the trees, the plants, the mints, the flowers, the wildlife 
and the guides shared information with each other about the cave tour routes, what looked like a 
cat on the wall, what looked like a witch on the wall, here’s how you throw a torch and  here’s 
how you make a torch. That’s how they shared their information with each other. You learned 
your tour by listening to other people’s tours and you took it for granted that everything they were 
saying was accurate, was correct and was true. You gave people a good time. The more they 
laughed, the better a time they had, the more they enjoyed the cave. They were showmen and the 
guides all the way through 19th century and in through most of the 20th century were that. They 
were showmen and did learn some things of a scientific nature. They didn’t want to lie to people 
but they didn’t always know the true story of how things formed or how the cave got to be the 
way it was, but they often felt that they were telling the truth. They felt that they had it right and 
sometimes they did. When I started working there sometimes it was a far cry from the truth what 
I was hearing on tours. 
 
[00:11:17] 
 
BB: So in your early career in the mid 80’s could we call it like a professionalization or an 
academicization? 
 
JL: Well, when I started working there we had just begun a few years before that to get more 
college graduated people on staff. There were a number of folks who were coming to work who 
were retirees from teaching and of course they were also college graduates. Then students started 
to come in for work as part of the seasonal way of doing things at that time. 
 
[00:12:02] 
 
BB: Was there more money? 
 
JL: Actually yeah. That year in 79 they did get more money because I’m not sure why, and I 
wasn’t in a position to know at that time, but it was primarily because of the year before and the 
couple years before that we had had higher visitation. They were having trouble handling all the 
people coming to the park. Tour limits were a lot higher then too. So, they were taking more than 
two-hundred people at a time on cave tours. Yeah, like two-hundred forty people at once to go 
into the cave. 
 
[00:12:42] 
 
BB: What is it now? 
	  
16	  
 
JL: Now on the historic tour its one-hundred twenty, which is still a lot of people but it’s much 
more manageable than have two-forty or even higher. I once accidentally had a tour that was sold 
twice, a historic tour. It had three-hundred fifty-seven people on it. Basically we were able to stop 
like once in the cave and the rest of the time just walking through the cave, just getting them 
through it at a safe pace and then back out. We’ve tried over the years to get the tour capacity on 
each tour down, and our visitation has dropped over the years. It’s coming back up some now, but 
it did drop over for a few years. That’s helped—actually for about ten years it’s dropped. That’s 
helped us kinda make it more manageable. We’re not really turning people away so much, and we 
didn’t really turn anybody away back then we just had huge cave tours. 
 
[00:13:55] 
 
BB:  So we started this thread by talking about you two being married and you started out as a 
seasonal and he started was a seasonal. Then we talked about couples and careers and how that 
has gone and you were using yourselves as an example. He in 79 had gotten… 
 
JL: Yeah, in 79 David got basically got that three way split position, and I got the next summer 
in 80 I got a seasonal position on the guide force. By then we were pretty much seeing each other. 
1981 in January I was still working seasonally. I was offered a permanent position with the 
personal office at Mammoth Cave because I had taken a clerk typist test down in Nash—I think it 
was down in Nashville, I had to go take it, and it—maybe in Bowling Green, I cant remember. 
Anyway, I took the test and I scored really high on it. That English major came into play I guess. 
I was offered a permanent position as a clerk typist in the Mammoth Cave personnel office. With 
that I wound up staying for about eight months and another position came up working as 
supervisor in the ticket office so I took that in August. David and I got married in September of 
1981. We got married at the Mammoth Cave Baptist Church September 5th 1981. At that time he 
was still working but he was law enforcement only by then and resource management. We lived 
across the river in the park at maple springs which was the Northside—north district ranger 
station. At that point it wasn’t really a working ranger station it was our house. That’s where we 
lived from September of 81 until January of 86 and we moved here to Park City in 86. We moved 
here yeah because David in 1985 decided to leave the National Park Service, our dual career, and 
go to work for the Postal Service and he immediately made more money an hour. That’s kinda 
were that went. I stayed with the park and he went to work for the Post Office. 
 
[00:16:54] 
 
BB: So you talk about dual careers, your experience seeing it, I’m sure it goes many different 
ways…some people they meet in the park. Can you talk to about some rise through the ranks, and 
informally you’re talking to the current superintendent how her life had to be with her [?] as they 
grew in the ranks. That’s interesting to me also—children following in footsteps or not. Are 
you—are you tired?  
 
JL: I’m fine. I’m fine. A number of times in the park service children will follow in the footsteps 
because they move from park to park. That’s the lifestyle that the kids know, and not everybody 
moves from park to park, obviously we didn’t, but parent’s interests and their own values tend to 
rub off on the kids. Then a lot of children growing up with park service parents know that 
lifestyle and they like it or enjoy it. So, some of them choose to follow in their parents footsteps 
or they get the same interests like our daughters are both interested in historic preservation and 
folk studies/folklore. Our older daughter just recently got her master’s degree at Western 
Kentucky University in folk studies, and our younger daughter is interested in—well anything 
	  
17	  
with animals pretty much, but she’s really interested in antiquarian things especially books. So 
she’s interested in studying vintage books and protecting the written word I guess. Yeah. That 
does happen where the kids fall in their footsteps. Another thing that happens too is employees of 
the National Park Service have kids who know about opportunities with the National Park 
Service, like if you’re in college you know how to apply for the jobs because your parents know 
how to apply for the jobs. It’s just like if you have family members who are union members, like 
the mill wrights, plumbers local or whatever, they know what you have to do or who you have to 
talk too to get into something like that so the same thing happens with the park service. We just 
know. You don’t have to beat the bushes and go try to find out how to get hired. You already 
know what papers to fill out and where to find them and who to talk too.  So that helps to some 
degree, but you also run into the fact that nepotism is not allowed in the park service. You know, 
you can’t supervise your family members so that can come back to bite you too. A lot of times 
people that are second or third generation park service will be working in another park. They just 
got to work somewhere else in the park service or as a seasonal somewhere.  
 
[00:20:25] 
 
BB: And then they have to do the long distance? 
 
JL: Right. Well from their parents or—they don’t seem to mind. Part of it is I think that it’s nice 
to be out on your own away from the folks at your own national park working, having your own 
life, start up, meeting your own friends and your own circle of support in the park service. 
 
BB: Yet you probably have got that common park language that you use 
 
JL: Oh yeah. The language doesn’t change much from park to park, not at all. 
 
[00:21:07] 
 
BB: I suppose maybe a parent might have a long-time colleague friend who works at another park 
and could they say, “hey can you help little Johnny… 
 
JL: Well you can ask but most of us don’t tend to do that. We don’t like to do that.  
 
BB: That would be [?]? 
 
JL: Well it’s—you don’t want to put your child or your friend in that position to have to say yes 
or no to it, and then especially you want your child to take care of themselves and learn how to do 
it on their own. Plus, you want them to do a good job. That would be embarrassing if you asked 
someone to give your child a job and they just didn’t show up, just didn’t make it work. Although 
I’m not going to say that people haven’t done that. People—some people have I’m sure. We don’t 
tend to do it much around…there are some of the family members working over at the park right 
now. Their kids, but they’re good applicants. They tend to know what it’s all about. Get the job 
done.

[Track 3] 
 
BB: So you’re talking about the ologist’s and professionalization or science taking maybe more 
of a role rather than simply just cave tours and that sort of thing. What scientific disciplines were 
kind of the first ones and where’s it going today I mean is it? 
 
JL: Well for one thing… 
 
BB: Climate change? 
 
JL: Yeah. Yeah. with climate change and everything else… One thing that started happening in 
the 80’s was they started giving these special emphasis years like one was ‘year of the child’, I 
think another one was ‘year of iriquality’ [I believe she meant ‘year of inequality’] or whatever—
reality special emphasis—things coming down the pike. It was becoming more and more apparent 
that at this park and others that there was not enough base line information being brought to the 
forefront to be able to tell what sort of changes were happening within parks. What is the health 
report card for this national park? So, what started happening was at Mammoth Cave for instance, 
we started—the superintendent started taking vacant positions, maybe an office position or maybe 
a guide position and turning that into a position that would be used for a science specialist like a 
hydrologist, a botanist or an air quality specialist. Gradually what was happening was when Dave 
Mahallock came in as our superintendent in the late 1980’s, one of the things he did was, he 
started putting together a totally new department, a new division within the park and pulling the 
resources management tasks away from law enforcement and putting it into a specialty group of 
educated scientists. Gradually over the years that group built and now we have a division of 
sciences and resource management. They go out study, collect, document and record anything on 
the surface of the park, with the river and in the cave. Now we’re much more ready to tell tax 
payers and our government leaders just what the health of the park is and what it isn’t. That’s 
something that changed twenty something years ago when they started bringing in folks that were 
actually educated in those tasks and in that type of research and we got credibility in the field. 
Now we have a number of people in the park who are specialists whether with the cave like a—
we actually have one who’s a cave specialist. We have someone else who deals—who really 
knows aquatic life, someone who deals with forestry, you know, trees and reintroducing different 
types of species. We have people that deal with exotic species trying to get rid of exotics in the 
park. I can’t begin to tell you all the things that they do now. We also have someone who, part 
time I guess you would say, archivist which we didn’t have before—Terry Langford who actually 
comes to us from Western Kentucky University in a partnership with them. She takes care of our 
collection which is housed at the resource management offices. So that’s kind of where that’s 
gone, and then in the mean time we had a cultural resources specialist, Bob Ward, who worked at 
the park for many years. Bob recently retired about three years ago. Maybe two years ago. 
Anyway, Bob’s position is vacant now. He went on to be the division chief for sciences and 
resources management. That’s what he was before he retired. Now we don’t really have a cultural 
resources specialist at the park. So, some of us at the park were kind of throwing in together to try 
and make that continue to happen with the park and with some of our partnerships that we have 
with other cultural—you know, other people like the SHPO and State Historic Preservation 
Office and other groups within the state of Kentucky and the park service—cultural groups like 
that. The guides started in the 80’s, and honestly I was one of the first probably.  The guides 
started conducting our own research which tended to be mostly related to the cave, past tours, 
past visitors, past guides, the old hotel, saltpeter, African American history all those sorts of 
things because we were looking for answers that we weren’t finding on tours or from each other 
and realized that those answers had to be out there somewhere. I for instance started heading off 
	  
19	  
to courthouses like the Edmonson County Courthouse looking up information specific to guides 
from the 19th century—looking at their old marriage licenses, anything in newspapers, anything in 
obituaries and anything that would give me any information on any of the names that I was 
familiar with, like Mike Bransford, Steven Bishop, Nick Bransford, others and Will Garvin, Will 
Bransford—just all these names that I was seeing in the cave on the cave walls. They were graffiti 
from early guides. I didn’t know who they were. I knew a little bit about some of them, but I 
wanted to know more about them. Once I started doing that they became real flesh and blood to 
me. I started finding photographs, identifying them and learning more about their family 
connections, their own family trees basically. I was just really-really caught up in trying to tell 
their story—putting them in context with the time period and with the visitors who were coming 
to the cave back in the 19th century. There were a lot of wealthy folks coming and they were 
writing all these travel journals, travel logs, all these letters home about what they saw at 
Mammoth Cave and how bad the roads were, what the rooms were like and they were describing 
the cave tours in great detail. Some things I was finding had to deal with Civil War and soldiers 
who had been at Mammoth Cave or who were camped close by. So there was just so many more 
stories that had never been told that we were picking up and finding and sharing on our tours. We 
wound up finding out that we started listening to each other more on tours. Each of us wanted to 
be that person who brought something new to the cave that week who found something new. It 
wasn’t about the same old same old stories anymore. It was about people, detail, being able to tell 
stories in a more personal way and making connections with the visitors in a more personal way 
than with just jokes and silliness that so many of the guides carried on with that we learned from. 
I’m not saying that people don’t sometimes make silly jokes, they do, but it’s not the begin-all 
end-all like it once was. Now they try to make people care about the park, about the cave and try 
to make them share our own sense of stewardship and our own feelings that the cave and the park 
are important, worth saving, worth caring about and worth our tax dollars. 
 
[00:10:11] 
 
BB: I was thinking about you talking about early guides and well the hole… 
 
JL: Oh, my bra incident? 
 
BB: but, also just being able I got it up there, I got it up there. I can see what you were just 
speaking about being involved in telling these little bit more complex cultural stories and maybe 
trying to one up each other—‘I got a new tidbit’. It’s almost the same kind of competitiveness  
 
JL: It is. It is, but we’re eager to share with each other. Everybody shares their news. Now with 
email and all that we can send—share with each other so easily. You can type something up or 
share a photograph and all of a sudden fifty people have it now instead of just yourself and it’s 
great. It happens all the time. People wind up kind of picking their own topic of favor like one 
person might be studying or looking into the whole possibility of the John Houchins story and the 
bear legacy/legend, which I see as just a legend, but others think it’s possible. It’s not a 
competition that way. It’s not I’m right, you’re wrong, it’s about bringing the information to the 
table and being able to have an intelligent discussion about it, and there are a lot of discussions 
about such things. 
 
[00:11:53] 
 
BB: And they happen? 
	  
20	  
 
JL: In the guide lounge, at dinner, around the fire at Seasonals. They can come up anywhere or 
anytime—the discussions—anywhere—bathroom. 
 
BB: Cause their so [?] for it. 
 
JL: Really. Seriously, that’s exactly right. They really care about and its funny the new seasonals 
coming in they know what their job is and they know they only get so much time for a break. 
They aren’t so willing to push their break time as some of the older ones are. You can tell when 
they’re in the guides lounge and their breaks about over. A couple guys are—people are telling 
stories or sharing information about some new research and you can just see them slowly grab 
their hat and then they’ll stand there for a while holding the hat knowing they need to be out to 
get to the information desk or whatever. Then they’ll take a couple steps away. They’ll still stand 
there and listen. Then they’ll take another step because they don’t want to leave the conversation. 
People love sharing that information with each other and learning. They all want to know it and 
they want to know it all. They’re working hard at it. I’m proud of them. I’m really proud of where 
we are now.  
 
[00:13:23] 
 
BB: And you helped to make it happen. 
 
JL: I hope so. I like to think that I had a little bit to do with it. 
 
BB: Absolutely. It’s gotta be satisfying. I mean really! 
 
JL: It is. It has been very satisfying working with some of the best people I could have ever asked 
to work with. Of course I hired most of them—a lot of them—not all of them, but a lot of them. 
They’re really good people. That’s one thing I’ve been blessed with, a wonderful place to work 
and a wonderful group of people to work with. I couldn’t have asked for better.  
 
[00:14:08] 
 
BB: That’s good. What else you want to tell me about? 
 
JL: I think that’s about it for now. 
 
BB: Ok. Thanks 
 
JL: Your welcome.
