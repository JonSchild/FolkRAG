Ladies and gentlemen:
 
"Melting Pots and Mosaics: Changing I

most o
f you k
now,the t
erm "melting pot" r
efers t
o a,
,t
heory t
hat was
 
w
idely accepted i
n t
he United S

he l
a
te 1
9th and early
 
20th centuries I
t held t

ind o
f gently
 
seething  c
rucible i
n
to which a
l
l peoples who i
mmigrated t
o t
he U
.S.
 
would t
umble t
o be melted i
nto a generic s
ort o
f s
tandard-issue
 
American. The early automobile magnate, Henry Ford, who a
lways
 
yearned f
or a mythic past, once p
roduced a d
ramatic p
resentation o
f
 
t
he melting pot t
heory i
n which a parade o
f  automobile workers o
f
 
a
l
l s
hapes, s

orth d

r

lags.
 
As you can see i
t
 was a c
heerful and i
n many a
reas a very popular
 
concept -
 t
he melting pot. The p
rincipal p
roblem w
ith i
t was t
hat i
t
 
d
idn't work. I
t t
urned out t
hat a
lthough certain i
ndividuals chose t
o
 
"melt", l
arger numbers declined t
he honor,and k
ind o
f f
loated a
round
 
t
ogether i
n l
umps .
 I
ndeed t
his was when t
he s
o-called h
yphenated-
Americans came i
n
to being, and we began r
eferring t
o Greek-
Americans, Japanese-Americans and s
o on. T
simpIy hadn't
 
melted nor d
id t
hey s
how much l
i
kelihood o
f doing s
o. Speech makers
 
and wordsmiths t
hen  began coming up w
ith  new i
mages ) 
s
ubstituting f
or t
he melting pot: s
tews, and s
oups, and t
ossed
 
salads, but a
l
l t
hese d
ietary a
l
lusions were not t
hat appropriate o
r
 
appealing. And so nowadays r et people t
end t
o s
peak o
f t
he United
 
S
tates as a mosaic -
-
 an overall design made up o
f many smaller
 
p
ieces o
f varying colors and t
extures. I
t
's a v
isually a
ttractive b
it
 
o

magery  t

There i
s a barren quality t
o sameness, i
sn't t
here?  Perhaps t
hat's
 
what doomed t
he notion o
f t
he melting pot.

Western Europeans a
re g
reat marketing people and we have been f
or
 
a very l
ong t
ime.  Mr. Columbus was a merchant basically -
-
 a very
 
b
right one,well educated f
or h

was not only l
ooking f

t was,after a

And even before Columbus, V
ikings f
rom northern Europe had sailed
 
a
l
l over t
he map setting up l
ocal markets, bartering t
h
is f
or t
hat,
 
c
reating new consumer demands among l

a f
amous advertising executive centuries l
ater would say, "
emptying
 
t
he barrel o

hat people would become ever l
ess
 
satisfied w
ith t
heir home-grown p

And nowadays t
he mercantile e
xplorers o
f our own t

go back home. They keep on hanging a

What makes a p

Ladies and gentlemen:
 
"Melting Pots and Mosaics: Changing I
mages o
f T
radition".  I
 s
elected
 
t
h
is t
i
t
le some months ago when i
nvited t
o address t
h
is
 
d
istinguished company l
ong before (
as s
o o
ften happens) I
 had t
ime
 
t
o actually t
h
ink what I
 m
ight want t
o say. I
t seemed t
o me t
hen a
 
r
elatively generous t
i
tular umbrella,essentially harmless and
 
s
ufficiently a
l
l-purpose t
o t
ake care o
f most eventualities. For, as
 
most o
f you k
now,the t
erm "melting pot" r
efers t
o a t
heory t
hat was
 
w
idely accepted i
n t
he United S
tates during t
he l
ate 1
9th and early
 
20th centuries '
,
I
t held t
hat t
he nation i
t
self was a k
ind o
f gently
 
s
eething  c
rucible i
nto which a
l
l peoples who i
mmigrated t
o t
he U
.S.
 
would t
umble t
o be melted i
n
to a generic s
ort o
f s
tandard-issue
 
American. The early automobile magnate, Henry Ford, who a
lways
 
yearned f
or a mythic past, once p
roduced a d
ramatic p
resentation o
f
 
t
he melting pot t
heory i
n which a parade o
f  automobile workers o
f
 
a
l
l s
hapes, s
izes and colors marched f
orth d
ressed i
n variegated
 
national costumes t
o parade i
n
to a k

l
l d
ressed i
n
 
r

lue and waving American f
lags.
 
As y
ou can see i
t
 was a cheerful and i
n many a
reas a v
ery popular
 
c
oncept -
 t
he melting pot. The p
rincipal p
roblem w
ith i
t was t
hat i
t
 
d
idn't work. I
t t
urned out t
hat a
lthough certain i
ndividuals c
hose t
o
 
"melt", l
arger numbers declined t
he honor,and k
ind o
f f
loated a
round
 
t
ogether i
n l
umps .
 I
ndeed t
his was when t
he so-called h
yphenated-
Americans came i
n
to being, and we began r
eferring t
o Greek-
Americans, Japanese-Americans and s
o on. They s
imply hadn't
 
melted nor d
id t
hey show much l
i
kelihood o
f doing s
o. Speech makers
 
and wordsmiths t
hen  began coming up w
ith  new i
mages ) 
s
ubstituting f
or t
he melting pot: s
tews, and s
oups, and t
ossed
 
salads, but a
l
l t
hese d
ietary a
l
lusions were n
ot t
hat appropriate o
r
 
appealing. And s
o nowadays r et people t
end t
o s
peak o
f t
he United
 
S
tates as a mosaic -
-
 an overall design made up o
f many smaller
 
p
ieces o
f varying colors and t
extures. I
t
's a v
isually a
ttractive b
it
 
o
f i
magery  t
hat could actually be extended t
o t

-
 i
t a
lways
 
makes me r
emember t

he
 
astronauts saw i

t back t

s i

-
 varied and
 
f
u
ll o
f color and somehow suggestive o
f a
l
l k
inds o
f possibilities.
 
There i
s a barren quality t
o sameness, i
sn't t
here?  Perhaps t
hat's
 
what doomed t
he notion o
f t
he melting pot.
 
But our beautiful b
right world-wide mosaic i
s i
n g
reat danger t
hese
 
days, g
rowing d
immer, f
ading i
nto s

been t
ermed by A
lan Lomax  "
the cultural g
rey-out" -
-
 a condition
 
t
hat r

abored t

-
s
ubstituting f
or t

f ever-
g

I
t a
l
l has t
o do w
ith t
he corrupting nature o
f t
rade goods, o
f course.
 
Western Europeans a
re g
reat marketing people and we have been f
or
 
a very l
ong t
ime.  Mr. Columbus was a merchant basically -
-
 a very
 
b
right one,well educated f
or h
is day,-- but when he v
oyaged out he
 
was not only l
ooking f
or t
he l
ands o
f t
he l
ndies,he was l
ooking f
or a
 
p
rofit. I
t was,after a
l
l, a mercantile t
ime he l
i
ved i
n
.
 
And even before Columbus, V
ikings f
rom northern Europe had sailed
 
a
l
l over t
he map setting up l
ocal markets, bartering t
h
is f
or t
hat,
 
c
reating new consumer demands among l
ocal people, "
emptying", as
 
a f
amous advertising executive centuries l
ater would say, "
emptying
 
t
he barrel o
f content  so t
hat people would become ever l
ess
 
satisfied w
ith t
heir home-grown p
roducts.
 
And nowadays t
he mercantile e
xplorers o
f our own t
ime don't ever
 
go back home. They keep on hanging a
round, a
t l
east b
y p
roxy, t
aking
 
up a
l
l t
he a
ir-time on t
he communication c
hannels, continuously
 
sending t
heir messages o
f desire t
hrough t
heir well-established
 
world-wide communication s
ystem. And t
hose messages mostly r
ead
 
i
n one way o
r another, "

 and t
here a

Only a f

 was s

was t

as s

She had

 but you s

f v

t
herefore i
t

 t
hey're

You k
now, i

ate t
hey a

Pretty s

 and no particular r

hat f
or a f

What makes a p
lace "worth v

ome
 
worth going back t

 The g
