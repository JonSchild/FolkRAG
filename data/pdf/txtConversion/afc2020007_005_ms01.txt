[00:00:00] 
 
EK: We have to do the formality of it. It's April 29, 2021. And it is, - I don't know what time it is. 
10:43 and we are talking to David. David, I don't know your last name. 
DE: Edwards, David Edwards.  
EK: And we are at the Lexington airport in Lexington, Missouri, with dogs. [Laughs.] So you don't 
fly so much anymore? jack said you had somebody who flies for you? 
 
DE: Yeah, I, I still fly some. My pilot Brett Dance is, lives in Carthage. So of course, the three hour 
drive right in the beginning of the season, and towards the end of the season, when it's just 
something that I can get in and go do, it’s not really worth his time to come up here. Then I go do it. 
So it got to a point where we were busy enough that I was dealing with farmers, co-ops, fuel guys. 
And still trying to fly at the same time. 
EK: Trying to do all the business and everybody? 
DE: Yeah. Still doing all the invoicing and, and I did all the bills, sent the bills out. And actually my 
wife come up to me and said, You're either gonna let me help, or I'm gone. Or you're gonna kill 
yourself. 
EK: That seems to be kind of a common thing that it's a partnership like a husband-wife sort of 
partnership. So you didn't want her to do it? 
DE: No, I guess I'm in this, most pilots are kind of a control freak. Yeah. So I needed my hands in it. 
And what was going on all the time and  
EK: Right.  
DE: But it wasn't worth losing my wife over so, she, she then she come in and she took over the 
office part of it. Rarmers in my opinion are uh… they want to deal with one person. And they want 
to deal with that person every time, you know, so the first couple of years, I was the only one there 
to talk to you. So when she came in and took over, it was a struggle to get them to start placing 
orders through her. 
EK: Really. 
DE: Yeah. 
EK: Even though they knew her anyway?  
DE: Yeah. So that was a difficult transition, you know, as much for her, you know. And, but it still, 
you know, to this day, I still have farmers that will call and… I tried the deal of setting my phone up 
and talking in the airplane and learn pretty quickly that that wasn't… 
EK: Like trying to drive and… 
DE: I've got too many things going on, you know, too fast. So kind of forced them into talking with 
her, you know, ‘cause I just turned my phone off, you know. But it still got, there's still a lot going 
on, you know, I'd come in, I'd land and get another load and, my ground help comin’ in and saying 
you need to move the plane, we got other planes behind you, you know, you're loaded, ready to go. 
But I was talking with this person, that person and I just and some older guys been doing it longer 
than I have finally just said, Look, you'll make more money if you put somebody in it.  
EK: Yeah,  
DE: You know. 
EK: How long have you been doing it?  
DE: Uh… (pause). This will be 16 years.  
EK: Yeah 
DE: Yeah. Yeah. 
EK: You can, I guess you can be about as busy as you want to be, huh? 
DE: Yeah. When we first started, I chased it everywhere I went to Lebanon, I'd go down, I had 
some guys we’d done stuff for and they liked as well enough that I used to go down there every 
year, and I'd go clear up to Kirksville. I used to chase it everywhere. 
EK: Right?  
DE: And again, just the way I looked at it, I can go and get all that. And I don't know that I make any 
more money. Because I'm chasing it so much. But um, my biggest concern was I'm not taking care 
of my regular customers here as well.  
EK: Yeah.  
DE: So I kind of quit chasing it, you know, I would, they would call still and I would help them find 
somebody else, you know, but I just wouldn't able to take care of my customers local here. Like I 
should have. 
EK: Right. 
DE:  You know. 
EK: So is it, is it competitive? Like, okay, so when we were in Harrisonville, apparently there are 
some people that come in from somewhere else that don't really know the culture of that specific 
area or the rules, the unwritten rules. And there was some resentment. And but on the other hand, 
Dusty said that there's enough work to keep everybody busy,  
DE: That’s true. 
EK: And that you don't really need to trespass on other people's area. Is that true for you, too? 
[00.05:35] 
DE: Yeah. I'm kind of in a unique position, because I own this airport. So it's public use, privately 
owned. Now, other aerial applicators can land here.  
EK: If you let them? 
DE: No, it's a public use, they can land, okay, you know, anybody can land. Warrensburg, the school 
down there, they come up here and practice, soft field landings and all that. I’ve got two grass 
runways. So the public can land here. But if another applicator comes in and wants to bring a load 
truck or something, I don't let them on.  
ED: Right.  
DE: So I'm kind of in a unique position because I,  
EK: Yeah, you are. 
DE: But there's other guys around that come and do it. And I don't get in, I don't get in conflict with 
them, you know, they're gonna do what they're gonna do if they do a good job. I don't have no 
qualms, you know, when they start cutting prices. Ridiculous.  
EK: That was I think the issue. 
DE: And I start doing bad jobs, given our industry bad press, so to speak. That's when I have issues 
with it, you know. I've got all the work I can do. You know. 
EK: This is amazing land up here. It's just like, huge compared to, what we like. 
DE: Yeah. 
EK: We live around the Nevada area. So they're like, I don't know how much what's the acreage of 
the average field? 
JK: Oh, your average fields gonna be 80 acres. 
DE: Yeah. 
JK: Maybe cut up with hedgerows, we got lots of wires, down there. And they, they you know, 
that's why surprising, you know, to me at least, knowing academically that there is an 802 you 
couldn't really get an 802 around, 
DE: Um-hm. 
JK: Down there in this fields. Even a 502, Dusty says a 502 is sometimes hard to work in some of 
the smaller fields. So, 
EK: And in south of us, we haven't seen them. I think they're on my list. But there are some guys 
that fly helicopters. With those really chopped up fields. 
JK: Yeah, they spray like 20 acres at a time, they fly Robinson 4466. And, you know, the further 
south you get, the smaller the fields get, and there'll be sprayin’ 20-30 acre patches. And it's just 
it's a little different, you know, up here its, 
EK: What are these? What is like, as we were driving?  
DE: Uh, it's not uncommon for me to uh… I mean, I still have them, you know, 40s and 60s, I went 
‘n’ done a 77 acre this morning. Three different fields. I mean, it's all one field, but it's cut up my 
trees, you know, so it's three patches. I still have that. But I've got some 150 to 250 acre fields. I'm 
fortunate enough that a lot of the growers around here work this together. So, I can put multiple 
fields together. Different customers, but I can put multiple fields together.  
EK: Yeah.  
DE: You know, if they were planting and everything went good, you know, I've done that before, 
you know. 
EK: So they just coordinate.  
DE: They don't so much. I promote it a lot. You know, one guy will come and say I gotta have this 
sprayed, you know, by tomorrow. And so I've called his neighbor you know, like, When is yours 
gonna be ready? Well, mine will be ready, three days from now. Well, how about we just work it 
together? You know, I'm on a, you want yours done tomorrow. I'll do it the next day, you want 
yours done two, three days from now. I'll do it a day early and, 
EK: Right.  
DE: And I’m fortunate, like I said, fortunate enough that they trust me. 
EK: Yeah. Well, they are the people you've known all your life.  
DE: No. 
EK: No? 
DE: No. Me and my wife moved down here in 2008. I had flown down here in 2007 for another 
company. I'd come down here and picked up some work for them. And thought that it was time to 
go out on my own. And we can, we moved down here. But I’d come and talk to the people, the co-
op really, I'd done worked a way if I moved down here and start my own, 
EK: From where?  
DE: I grew up Savannah, Missouri. 
EK: Oh, okay. Which is right by Mound City. 
DE: Mm-hm, not far, you bet. But I run heavy equipment for 45 years.  
EK: So why’d you decide to do the spraying? 
DE: I've always wanted to fly. I grew up, there was a guy I went to school with, his dad was a crop 
duster. So I grew up, I would hear him. I'd get on my bicycle and take off crosstown and then by 
the time I get there, he'd be done, and be gone, but I chased him over town.  
EK: What is it about that sound? (Laughs.) 
DE: Oh, I don’t know.  
[00:11:01] 
JK: Was it an old radial? 
DE: No, it was a, he flew Cessna, ag wagon, ag truck. Yeah.  
JK: Something about those 50s that sound good. Yeah. I appreciate the fact that [garbled] six, that 
you increase your productivity and you save money, but there's something about like, either 
continental or Lycoming or big Pratt radial that just sounds right. 
DE: Yeah. 
EK: So anyways, planes when you were a kid, 
DE: Yeah. And then my granddad had the heavy equipment. So I just fell into that, you know, and I 
don't know why 22 in the 25 years, I was all over the country. Just burnt out I guess. I always 
wanted to fly. So I went to ag flight Bainbridge, Georgia to learn to fly do exactly what I'm doing. I 
don't want to fly charter I don't want to, I don’t even have an interest. That doesn’t interest me. 
EK: Too that's pretty typical. I think Kevin is an exception. The other guys say the same thing, 
they’re not interested. 
DE: I love what I do. It’s a job, You know, just like anything else, it’s a job. But I look forward to it, 
ever day. You sit in it 8, 9, 10 hours a day, you know it… But it's one of the few jobs I've ever done 
where I, it don't matter. I get up every morning ready to get back in. But now… Like I said, we're 
fortunate to be as successful as we are. To bring Brett Dance in. And he's an exceptional pilot.  
EK: And he’s in Carthage. 
DE: Lives in Carthage.  
EK: So how do you know Kevin?  
DE: Just from doing what we do. You know, he's come through here. Landed, tried to get fuel. But 
I've always had turbines, I've never had any AV gas here, so… I actually went down and talked to 
his brother, Kimin. When I first got into my job. Didn't happen, ended up in south Texas. Then 
Kevin went out on his own and we just, I don't know.  
EK: Kevin’s pretty serious about it.  
DE: Yeah. You know, when he’s got questions, or I have questions, you know, we'll call them if he 
needs help, or if I need help. 
EK: Seems like that's pretty common too. That, you've got that, that everybody has like, a go-to 
person to help them solve, solve problems. 
DE: And there's five other operators around here within 50 miles of me. And we all get along. Four 
of us get along really well. I don't, you know, like if I have somebody from their area calls and says, 
Hey, I got some sprayin’ I want done, I will call Blake Alred (?). I'll call Blake, hey, why is this guy 
calling me? First, I don't I'm not gonna go step on Blake’s toes. I don't want him owin’ Blake a 
bunch of money. Then trying to get in on me. So I just checked, you know, I'll do that to all the guys 
around me. You know, he may say David I told him call you I'm sorry. I can't get in there and get it 
you know sometimes that’s the case. 
EK: So is that person that you don't get along with… 
DE: I get along with him. 
EK: Like he doesn't call? 
DE: No. I get along with him it's a struggle. I’ve been told that he is a genius he has that IQ that he 
qualified as a dean but he really struggles to communicate people very well. We get along but I 
think it's because I refused to fight with him you know. We got our moments, we’ll have discussion 
you know, I let him do what he does all I ask is the same in return. 
[00:15:57] 
EK: It’s a really small world all you guys belong. I kinda think of it as a million club. 
DE: Right, yeah. 
EK: Not that you guys mix, but it seems like, you know, as widespread as you are, and you know, 
like, in these nice little (garbled) you know, I mean, you all know each other. 
DE: Yeah, cuz July is when I really start. So July and August is my two busiest months. And I've got 
guys out of Louisiana, Arkansas. And they're pretty much the same guys. Now I've gone through 
some that come help me every year. You know? So some of my best friends are in Louisiana and 
this is how we met is through this occupation. 
EK: Do you do retraining at all? Like in a year and some people practice this great batteries and do 
training. 
DE: We did this year because I just acquired this plane this year. So I know the guy that had it and I 
know there wasn’t gonna be any issues with it, but for our satisfaction, we'll, we'll pattern test it. 
Guy’s name, I’ll think of it here in a minute. But he used to go all over the country doing pattern 
tests. And he's retired now but I could still call him tonight they'll send me a string out, run acrost 
it, send the string in and they'll analyze it, send it back, give me my effective swath width and give 
the cards, easy to find. So we still do it ourselves, you know. They can go other places, they do it. 
EK: Do you always fly an 802? 
DE: No I started with a 5. And I run a 5 until 2017. I bought a 6, and in 2018 I bought an 8. So I had 
a 6 and an 8. 
EK: At the same time? 
DE: Yeah.  And actually Brett Dance father flew for me. I had a father and son flying for me. And a 
couple of bad years, or not as good a years, you know 17 and 18 was pretty rough. So I had an 
opportunity to sell the 602. I sold it and kept the 8 and then I just traded this year.  
EK: So Brett, he drives up from Carthage? 
DE: Most of the times he'll fly up sometimes. He’s got his own plane. Got a 170. 
JK: Hm. That’s a neat little plane. 
DE: Got a J-3 Cub, that’s the plane that he learned to fly in come for sale. He really originally from 
Atlanta. And the guy that taught him how to fly put that Cub up for sale. And he went and bought it. 
JK: That's cool. Yeah. 
EK: Kevin’s teaching him (JK)  
JK: Yeah. He's trying. Mostly Kevin keeps me from killing us both. (Garbled.) He always smacks me 
on the shoulder and told me loosen up and keep my eyes up because I like the instruments. I like 
the science part of it, as opposed to the stick and rudder stuff. So my stick and rudder work kinda... 
I'm pretty tense, right? But he's uh you know, Kevin is such an instinctive pilot that I feel like I gain 
a lot more learning from him as opposed to more traditional flight instructor who would sit me 
down in the classroom. I don't need help with the books. It's about the classroom right? So yeah, 
Kevin, he's a he's a damn good pilot though. 
DE: Yeah, he has to be. I've seen some of the junk he’s flown in here. [Laughing.] I have to wonder. I 
made absolutely no sense how it even flew. He flew it in and flew it out. That was all I was glad to 
see and go, much as I like him. 
[00:20:46] 
JK: Has he flown his Luscom (?) in here? 
DE: Um-um. 
JK: He’s got a Luscum, and I asked him, I said, how's that fly. He said hard. [Laughing.]  
DE: Yeah. Yeah, they come in, him and somebody else come in here one time when a couple of 
Pawnees. And I swear to God I don’t know how them things made it. They’d been up into Iowa. On 
the corner of it and they were coming back through. Yeah, I have no idea how they flew in and not 
sure how they got out. But… 
JK: He can you know, he can fly. I've seen him land the plane was hand on the center of the yoke. 
You know, you just kinda, you know, does this and I go. I mean, it doesn't compute for me, but he 
can. He can yank that thing around this guy. Pretty easy. 
DE: Sam Dyer was a crop duster over in Marshall.  
JK: We've heard that name. Yes.. 
DE: And crop dusted for either 53 or 56 years.  
EK: Oh, my God.  
DE: Actual crop dusted. He flew longer than that.  But he crop dusted, I think it was 53 years. 
EK: Is that, that’s the guy that Sam Styron was talking about.  
JK: Yes. Styron mentioned Sam Dyer. 
DE: Yeah.. And he was an instructor. And he was also uh, examiner for the FAA., He’d give you your 
flight test. 
JK: That seems pretty rare that ag pilots are, you know, they jump up to the CFI and then become 
an examiner. I don't… 
DE: But families…. 
EK: Well I think there’s’ a guy that lives around us, his name was Eddie Hamersly, and I think he 
was in his 70s. 
JK: Yeah, when he quit. 
EK: And didn’t Dusty buy his plane? 
JK: Uh, he didn’t buy his plane. He flew in Ag Cat and when Dusty first got started., well he started 
with a Pawnee, of course, and he got an Ag Cat and Eddie Hamersley had a bunch of spare parts, 
like still in the can for that Pratt radial. And so he bought a bunch of stuff. And I, Eddie kinda, I 
mean Eddie is a crusty old guy. So he kind of mentored Dusty a little bit. But you know that he said 
it was hard because he said Eddie Hamersly didn't have time for anybody else. Yeah, he uh, I think 
that probably... I don't know when he started. My grandma knew Eddie Hamersly, so he'd been 
flying for at least 40 years. maybe longer than that. Yeah.  
EK: Yeah. He’d be like a hundred now. 
JK: He probably flew for 50 years.  
EK: He flew a long time. Used to wake me up when I first got married and moved to the farm. Wake 
me up at seven in the morning. [Laughter.] 
DE: So I started in ‘93. With Sam. I actually stopped taking lessons from him because of the 911 
deal. That wasn’t in ‘93.  
EK: That was 2001. 
DR: So that's when I, 2001. Started taking a lesson from Sam in 2001 because we got shut down. 
They shut general aviation down.  
EK: And so that cut off your lessons. 
DE: From Sam, yeah. I could already solo, Sam soloed me in three hours. Three hours of 
instruction. 
EK: So was this before or after you went to Georgia? 
DE: Oh, this was before. I went down there in ’05. 
EK: Oh, okay. So you started learning to fly before you decided… while you were in Georgia. 
DE: Yeah. So when they shut it down because of that 911 deal, in that time I had taken a job out in 
Utah, and quit flying. Quit flying until ’04, and I said, I'm done. I want to go fly. Learn to do what 
I'm doing right now. 
Come back and I asked him I said, well I found a plane, Could I come help you? He said, You need to 
find a plane to start your own business. He said, You need to set up about 30 to 50 miles away 
from me, he said, ‘cause I’m going to retire one of these days. And you just need to be here and 
catch these customers as I start to slow down. So that’s how I ended up here. 
Now I think there’s four maybe five operators flying off that Marshall airport, which is where Sam 
was. I don't know, they don't have a control tower there. They're complete chaos. In July, it's 
complete chaos.  
EK: What did Dusty call it, July d August? 
SK: Seventy-five days of hell. [Laughing.] 
Yeah. And I mean, you're…, in my experience with ag pilots, you're not exactly known for kind of 
keeping to the strict radio discipline that the FAA?  
DE: Don’t have to.  
JK: No, no, you know, flying low altitude, 
DE: It's changed now. You know, all this, all this ADSB stuff, you know. And I didn't have radios in 
my planes for a long time. In Kansas City’s airspace starts their mode C bail starts six miles west of 
here.  
JK: Oh. 
DE: That's how close I am to Kansas City. airspace, you know. But I've even gone up and flew right 
in between downtown Kansas City and KCI. Parkville came up there. I go up there. There's 2,700 
acres that I go spray every year up there. Even without a radio, I would call them on the phone, 
Downtown, KCI and I'd call them and say I'm coming through. That's what I'm doing, and this is 
how many times I'll be through there. And this is when I should be done. That's okay. Call us when 
you're done.  
EK: So when you do that, come back here to reload? 
DE: Um-hm. Yeah, they used to go up there to Noah's Ark, an old strip up in there. But it changed 
hands and the guy that bought it didn't want this heavy of aircraft on it. He owned it, it's his rule 
so… So yeah, we just started and that was really one of the things, one of the eggs in the basket 
that pushed me towards a bigger plane than a 502. 
EK: Yes, because bigger capacity.  
JK: Fewer ferries. 
DE: Yeah, yeah. 
EK: So one of one of our guys shared like a bad crash that he’d done. Really lucky but I thought it… 
he had some pictures of it. Clipped some wires at the very end of the day. Said he had like 10 
gallons on Like Ken downs on and he really shouldn't leave it in the tank. He’d just fly it on and  
just go back. You know, but he just unloaded and clipped it and then flipped the Air Tractor and 
everything was mangled except the cockpit. Which was pretty amazing. Have you ever had a bad 
wreck? Or any kind of close call? 
DE: Well I have a close call every day. [Laughter.] No, uh,  I've run out of fuel three times from 
being in a hurry, you know. I've been fortunate enough that I made, I never tore anything up when 
it landed.  
EK: Where’d you have to land? 
DE: One time it was right here. I was on my way back here and made it. My wheels touched down 
six feet inside my property, that’s how close it was [laughs]. And, but I knew before that I was 
close, I was over on the other side of the river down by Higginsville 30 miles from here. And one of 
them deals I had 200 acres to go do, it's going to take me an hour, so I didn't load up with fuel. But 
it was 200 acres in eight different fields. And I couldn't tie any of them together. So I was over 
there a lot longer. And I was done. And when I turned to come home the argument that I used to 
talk myself into to continue to come on home instead of landing at Higginsville Airport was the 
needles are still bouncing. So there's still enough fuel to slosh in there. So I'll come back and I flew 
to the Bluff, the river bluff this side of the river is all this flatland. That side of the rivers all Hill 
Country. So I flew to the Bluff, knowing, and then I turn and come straight towards my airport. 
Knowing that if it quit, all I had to do was cross the river and land out in the bottoms. Yeah. 
EK: So you had a plan. 
DE: Yeah, as bad as it was. [Laughter.]  
 
[00:31:31] 
JK: Yeah, you always have a plan. You always need to have a plan. Even if you know you're making 
kind of a sketchy decision. 
DE: Oh yeah, it was a bad decision from the minute that I took off. 
EK: Is that when you first started or was that like, after…? 
DE: Oh, no, no, I was well started and I was, had some time, I had enough time to know better. Uh, I 
run out over in Kansas one time. We were over in… (pause). Name escapes me right now. 
Burlington.  
EK: Oh, yeah. That’s central 
DE: We were over there spraying, I was helping. I work for Floyd McElwain out of St. Joe and we're 
over there spraying and it was Fourth of July and it happened to fall on a weekend and we were 
over there spraying. And all of this that I'm about to tell you is exactly why I do not fly on the 
Fourth of July and the weekend that people celebrate the Fourth of July. Because we were over 
there working and everybody's outside having picnics and you know having a good time. And the 
sheriff department had been out three times to talk to us. People are calling in. We're not doing 
anything wrong other than aggravating. Well the fourth time that deputy showed up the same day, 
I may or may not have lost my calmness. Got in an argument with him. We usually pulled up and 
fueled up and then pulled around and loaded. Well when I come in there were somebody fueling 
so I pulled over to get loaded the guy loaded me and I was arguing with this deputy, got back in 
airplane and took off. Never went and got fueled up. So I landed. Fortunate I landed in a waterway. 
Didn't do anything to the airplane but when we got to finally got ahold of somebody that was the 
next challenge was getting hold of somebody on the Fourth of July that wouldn't celebrating. 
EK: Wasn’t mad at you. 
DE: Or drunk. You know two o'clock in the afternoon on the Fourth of July it was tough to find a 
sober person would speak to me. Anyway, we got out of there and they bent two boom brackets 
pulling it out of the field with the tractor. Anyway, I made it through it. But that's the reason I don't 
fly on the Fourth of July or the weekend of. 
JK: Do you get a lot of you know, you're talking about all those people calling you in and stuff. Do 
you get a lot of that when you're flying? I know Dusty has been a been you know, complained 
about to the FAA because… 
DE: Oh yeah. Yeah, and it's gotten worse.  
EK: Really? What are you doing that’s offensive? To them? 
DE: Well, this is gonna be a long drawn out answer. One of the reasons is people moving out of the 
city, moving into the rural areas. You know, they got a five acre lot now they think they're rural. 
But they've either built a house or bought a house that's right in the middle of the field that we 
spray. And they don't like it.  
[00:35.18] 
JK: They don't like the spraying, or they don't like the noise? 
DE: They don’t like any of it. But it's also my belief that this whole social media has made a lot of 
cowards very vocal. It's easy to sit behind a computer screen and talk crap on somebody. Where if 
you had, before this if you had a problem, you about had to walk through that door, and we would 
figure something out. You know? I will try to oblige anybody that has concerns if at all possible. I 
will. If I can I try to explain to them why I can't. Sometimes it's just as simple as giving them a call 
and they go to town and get a cup of coffee while I'm doing, you know. But this whole social media 
deal is made a lot of cowards very vocal. And, yeah, it's awful. 
JK: Yeah, Dusty, was pretty upset about a Roundup commercial, like it was if you have cancer its 
from Roundup. And so the main, the main video clip they played on his commercial was an Air 
Tractor spraying. So he was really upset about that, because and that's something Sam Styron 
talked about, too. The work you do is really visible because everybody can hear and see the Air 
Tractor. And so it doesn't matter if you know, the main culprit’s the drift or, you know, ground 
rigs. You're the guy that get the heat. Do you feel like that? That's the case? 
DE: Oh, absolutely. Yeah. I went to the, I used to do a lot of spraying for the University of Missouri. 
And I was down there one time, at a convention like deal, and they were talking, this guy had come 
in and talked about chemicals, you know. And I'll never forget this. I always wished I'd have 
recorded it. But he stood up there. And first thing he said was, how many people, how many of you 
all have gotten complaints that whatever you're spraying is making them sick. And everybody in 
the room raised their hand. He said all right, he's, I’m gonna give you some help. He said, have a 
bottle of Clorox have a label a bottle of Clorox in your house, or any stout cleaning agent like that. 
Have that it's your place of business. And when somebody comes in, we'll pull the label for 
whatever product you're using. And have that Clorox label and put them both down in front of ‘em. 
Clorox is way more toxic than anything you're putting out through an airplane or a ground rig. To 
people. Way more toxic. 
JK: Well the quantities you're spraying, I mean you’re not spraying that much… 
DE: Yeah, we put out point six four ounces to the acre.  
EK: Yeah, Sam Styron was talking about how little per acre there actually is. 
DE: You know, even an insecticide, you know, which, for years is always the you know, the dark 
horse in the group, you know. Which it was back in the day it was wasn't near regulated like it is 
now. But even now we're looking four ounces to the acre or less out, you know, 
JK: Even today Mustang has kind of a bad rap. You know, Mustang and fast track, is that what it is?  
DE: Fastak. But yeah, I just think it's insecticide very, you know, we've noticed a lot as I'm sure 
everybody else has to. Vineyards, you know, organic. Bees. Everybody's got either a grapevine a 
beehive or two fruit bearing trees in their yard. Luckily, there’s been a group field watch that in 
the state, terribly encourages people to register it. So that way we know about it. 
EK: Register that there’s an organic…? 
DE: Yeah, it can be an organic crop, be a beehive,, orchards, apple trees, peach trees, whatever it 
may be, if they're registered through this field box deal, then we can see it. The software that I use 
to do our mapping stuff they incorporate that into it. So we set up boundaries from the field. And it 
tells us anything and everything that's around it that's registered. But if it's not registered, and you 
don't know that it's there. You know, it's, it can be devastating, you know?  
JK: Well, if you haven't, I mean if you don't know about it, then I don't see the whole, the whole 
pilot mentality is identify a problem, fix the problem. And so if people are getting upset about 
something that you don't know about, you can't fix that problem if you don't know about it. 
DE: Yeah. 
EK: How, like, how much of a problem is it actually? Like, I know that around us, if it’s even slightly 
windy, they won't spray. They are trying to control the drift. And, and the only time that I've ever 
noticed, because we like,we live right in the middle of cropland that is like, our farm. The only time 
I've ever noticed anything is like spray rigs, the ground rigs. I've never, I've never known anything 
from the aerial spraying at all.  
[00:41:37] 
JK: You'll get out and spray though when it's you know, 10 to 15 mile an hour. But… 
DE: And it depends. I mean, the label, there's there are some fungicide right now that's labeled up 
to 15 miles an hour. But 90 percent of the time I have an insecticide in there with it. And it's 10. 
Label-wise, you can't find anything over 10. 
JK: Do you, uh, do you typically go by the label? Or do you kind of go by your experience more so? 
DE: It depends. You know, if I got to go up next to the city, in the potential and they don't even 
have to get on ‘em, all they have to do is smell it. Yeah. And they'll freak out. So it depends on 
where I'm going, if I'm going out here in the middle of nowhere, you know, or there’s nobody 
around to affect. I mean, a lot of what we do is Kentucky windage. You know, yeah, we've got GPS, 
you know, fly by the light bars and precision ag that way. But, you know, if you've got to, you're 
flying east and west, and you got to 10 mile an hour south wind. You know, if you fly right at the 
edge of that field, you know that that's going to go over to the next field and so there's little 
Kentucky windage of where to start at that you are pretty certain and that's where it stopped and 
when it hits the ground. 
JK: It kind of kind of falls in with that that whole, you know, stick and rudder philosophy rather 
than the instrument. 
EK: So, we’re gonna wind this up, because I know you've got another thing that you do. Final 
words like if someone's sitting in a research room listening to you, what do you want to say to 
them? About what you do?  
DE: My, probably my biggest complaint about what we do is rules. I don't mind following rules I 
have absolutely no trouble with it. And I'm not gonna, I'm not throwing the FAA under the bus.,I'm 
just going to use them as an example. If you ever sit down and read the way a rule is written. It is 
so vague. It is so up to interpretation. How I interpret it to be correct and is correct. may be 
different than the way that you interpret it to be correct. And is also correct. Now I get it. It's wrote 
by attorneys. Attorneys love to argue and you're going to be in court letting him argue and paying 
him a lot of money. You know, I get it. That's my biggest hang up probably. It let's make the rules 
that are more specific. I think they'll find that the biggest majority of us that do what we do, don't 
have a problem with following rules. But when your rules are in such a gray area that we think 
we're doing the right thing, and then now all of a sudden because somebody made a phone call, 
and now we're up to our neck and trouble. We're, and honestly thought we were not doing 
anything wrong, we flew it according to how we interpret it. That's probably my biggest hang up 
was what we do, it's actually starting to become not fun.  
EK: There's a misunderstanding between what you're actually doing and what people are… 
DE: A quick, a quick scenario: congested area. We, aviation, has to fly a certain distance away from 
congested areas. Whether you're, do what we do, or whether you're a general aviation pilot or 
whatever, you got to be a certain height, distance away from… Our 137 that we operate under 
gives us some leeway to that. But congested area, I have been told, and I believe it to be his 
interpretation of this rule, could be two houses. Or it can be a park where they're having a picnic of 
more than two people. So again, it's interpretation. Let's let's make it clear, listen, let's give us a 
line. You know, that way we know, we see this. That's why rules is and I feel more comfortable 
telling this person or making the decision. I can't do that. That's my biggest hangup. So anything 
moving forward, let's clear up some of the gray area.  
EK: It’s probably a bigger problem close to the city isn’t it? 
DE: Oh obsolutely. Yeah, I get visited by the FAA every year. Which is fine. I don't have no problem 
with it.  
EK: Based on a complaint? 
DE: Sometime. They're actually supposed to come every other year to do a inspection on the 
aircraft. And on my record. With that being said, them four other operators, I was telling you 
about, haven’t seen an FAA inspector in three plus years.  
EK: But you see them every year? Why? 
JK: Because you're closer. 
DE: I'm closer, I'm 30 minutes, 45 minutes from their office. Anybody else is an hour plus. It is 
what it is. 
EK: [Laughs] Still too long.  
DE: Yeah, you know. And I'm close to the city, you know, people call, tend to call more. 
EK: I can't imagine. I can't imagine calling like… So one thing that's very obvious to me is that most 
people don't have a clue what you do. And that's like, that's true, like of truck drivers too. And 
professions when you're on your own, and you have to make a lot of decisions based on like, gray, 
gray area type rules. And I think that man, you hit on it when you said social media emboldens 
these people. Everyone's got an opinion. And it used to be like everyone had an opinion, but they 
didn't share it with the world. But I can't imagine like turning somebody in for something that’s 
just offends me, for whatever reason, you know, when I don't know anything about what you do. 
DE : That's, that's Yeah. You're, you're not educating yourself about it, to actually form an opinion. 
If you're not educated about it, your opinion really doesn't… 
EK: Shouldn't matter.  
DE: It shouldn't stand for anything, you know, but you get educated about it, and you can come to 
me and show me or give me a legitimate complaint. You know, I mean, I got guys saying, I don't 
want you flying over here because I got cattle. Okay.  
EK: Or my kid has leukemia. Could you give us a heads up? 
DE: Yeah. Yeah, you know, but it's these, you know, the ones that we've talked about in society in 
itself is getting this way. There's no accountability. You can say whatever you want. But there's no 
accountability for your actions.  
JK: You don't have to back it up either. 
DE: Exactly. Yeah, just throw stuff out there and 
EK: The problems. The problem with that is that once you get it out there it just snowballs. 
DE: It can, yeah. If it draws enough or the right attention. And what I do for a living, in the rural 
area, draws a lot of attention.  
JK: Yeah, it can. It can and it's not again those ground rigs they're guilty of a lot more stuff but they 
don't get the attention because they’re not flying 140 knots. 
DE: And above the trees. 
JK: Twenty feet out you know and people talk about oh, I saw so and so fly under wires and you're 
like, no, don’t think so.  
EK: But maybe. [Laughing.] 
DE: And I have. But I’ve also been accused of spraying the wrong field. “I've seen you spraying the 
wrong field.” “Was you parked next to that field I was spraying in?” Well no but I was just down 
the road I said then you have no idea wherer I was at. The perception where you think I am is 
completely 
JK: different?  
DE: Yeah. 
[00:50:58] 
JK: And I mean the thing is, they're always, because of that whole whole, whole distance thing and 
the size of the airplane. You know people don't realize just even a 402 is plenty big. And so they 
see it and I think they're a lot closer than they are. 
DE: Oh yeah, yeah, that's everybody goes and goes that thing’s a lot bigger on the ground. It’s the 
same size on the ground is at is in the air. 
EK: Do you have time for a few photos.  
DE: Yeah. All right.  
EK: So okay. All right. We found these interviews can last like forever, so we have to hard kill ‘em.
