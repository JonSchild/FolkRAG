WALKED ALL THE WAY FROM MISSOURI
Walked all de way from Missouri (Hee!) And I come through Arkansas; Got so weak an'
hungry (eeh!) Couldn' move my underjaw.
Fed me on cornbread and 'lasses (eeh!) An' meatskins I could not chaw. Biscuits so
raggedy an' taggedy (eeh!) Till I sprung my underjaw.
Mama, bring me a pillow, (eeh!) An' lay right under my haid; Whiskey surround my body
(eeh!) An' sport life gonna kill-a me daid.
Sung by J.L. Goree, Houston, Texas, April, 1939.
