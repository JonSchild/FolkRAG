[00:00:00] Brief introduction; Lawrence Key (“Luscious Lawrence”) describes basic personal 
background information including his date of birth, his hometown of Harvey, Illinois and his 
current place of residence at the Ohio Valley Wrestling training school in Louisville, Kentucky.  
 
[00:02:30] Key details his own personal connection to wrestling. Key’s godfather, with whom he 
had a deep connection, introduced him to televised professional wrestling at an early age. Key 
mentions that his godfather owned old Wrestlemania tapes, including Wrestlemania III, along 
with Saturday Night’s Main Event and World Championship Wrestling. He describes wrestlers 
as “body guys” (e.g. The Ultimate Warrior, Hulk Hogan)  and was drawn to their athleticism as 
well as their physical physiques. Key shares a story about stealing wrestling action figures when 
he was younger. 
 
[00:05:55] Key recounts his journey towards becoming a professional wrestler, which started 
“later in life” as compared to other wrestlers. When Key’s family moved to Tennessee, he 
learned about The School of Morton, a training school owned and operated by WWE Hall of 
Fame inductee Ricky Morton. Key reached out to Brandon and Brent Tate (“The Tate Twins”) 
who recommended attending Morton’s school. Key talks about meeting Morton, the try-out 
process, and how the school is structured. Morton’s business partner, wrestler James Strange, 
was also influential in the earliest stages of Key’s career.  
 
Training involved practices every Tuesday and Sunday and running shows once per month. After 
three months of training, Key was informed he should start investing in gear and developing a 
gimmick. “They basically just threw me in right away.” Key theorizes that his physical 
appearance was the driving force behind his early success. He talks about creating a list of 
potential in-ring names before deciding on “Luscious Lawrence.” Key briefly touches on the 
story behind his first match, which involved borrowed gear.  
 
Returning to the topic of training sessions, Key mentions learning how to bump, run the ropes, 
and necessary safety precautions. “The basics and the fundamentals of professional wrestling.” 
 
[00:10:46] Key talks about crafting his in-ring persona and how he views Luscious Lawrence as 
an extension of himself. “Before I met my wife, I considered myself a ladies’ man.” As an 
introvert, Key uses Luscious Lawrence as an outlet for expressing himself in more subversive 
ways. “It’s been a fun journey, and I’m still adding to it. I’m trying to develop more and make it 
better and better.”  
 
Relatedly, Key describes his wrestling “style,” which he considers to be “more old school” as a 
result of being trained by Ricky Morton. He also draws inspiration from popular wrestlers who 
were famous during the 1980s and 1990s, combining elements of performance and costuming. 
Aesthetically, Key uses bright colors and animal prints to portray a slightly “ambiguous” and 
“flamboyant” character. “I’m just a weirdo, I guess.”

[00:14:34] Key returns to outlining his career trajectory. While at The School of Morton, Key 
continued wrestling for different promotions, including a “dark match” (i.e. a non-televised 
match at a televised taping) at the renowned Ring of Honor. Key was also good friends with a 
referee at Ohio Valley Wrestling who told him about an upcoming “wrestling combine” where 
wrestlers could be evaluated on a series of physical challenges both in and out of the ring. Key 
performed in the top five and was awarded a two-year scholarship to the OVW training school.  
 
Key describes what his scholarship entails. OVW and the Al Snow Wrestling Academy is an 
accredited trade school where enrollees can earn a certificate in “professional wrestling and 
sports entertainment.” Key mentions that the academy offers courses on personal training, 
nutrition, social media and marketing, wrestling etiquette, and the history of professional 
wrestling.  
 
[00:17:27] Key outlines a typical performance day from start to finish. “It’s very 
nerve-wracking.” OVW, which is televised, operates on a tight schedule with a pre-planned card 
broken down into taping segments. Working out, tanning, preparing a gear bag, and warming up 
are all parts of the process. “It’s a lot of waiting around.” After the match is finished, wrestlers 
are offered critiques on their in-ring performance. “We try to put on a good show the best we 
can.” 
 
[00:20:20] Key walks through what thoughts are running through his head during a performance. 
Before his entrance, Key tries to clear his head in order to focus on the task at hand. “For 
wrestlers, there’s that switch.” Total immersion involves ring-awareness and time-management. 
Remembering spots, remaining in character, pacing, and entertaining the crowd are key 
components to a strong match. Matches are predetermined, but improvisational skills are 
essential. Calling spots can be detrimental to a match, which ultimately influences the audience’s 
reaction.  
 
[00:24:02] Key believes locker rooms are sacred spaces. “Me personally, I love the 
camaraderie.” Key chooses to work out in the corner before his matches. While he remarks that 
“the cat is out of the bag” in reference to what happens behind the curtain, Key still attempts to 
keep locker room conversations private.  
 
[00:25:30] He touches on the differences between The School of Morton and Ohio Valley 
Wrestling. The School of Morton provides a solid foundation for beginning wrestlers, especially 
as it is managed by such an illustrious professional wrestler. Ohio Valley Wrestling is “pretty 
much the most well-known wrestling school in the world.” OVW has produced numerous 
professional wrestlers who have gone on to star in the WWE. “It’s part of wrestling history.” 
OVW is managed by professional wrestler, manager, and promoter Al Snow. Key talks about the 
national and international expansion of OVW.  
 
[00:29:35] Key talks about how professional wrestling has evolved over the course of the last 
several years. “The business hasn’t changed, it’s just the audience is more sophisticated now.” 
He suggests that streaming media has shortened attention spans, which causes fans to expect

more fast-paced events. Key also explores the suspension of disbelief as it relates to audience 
expectations, the predetermination of matches, and the wrestling business as a whole.  
 
[00:32:48] Key examines how he builds relationships with fans both in and out of the ring. “The 
main goal when you get into that ring is to get over with the audience.” Wrestlers are constantly 
forming connections and attempting to elicit some sort of emotional response. Social media is 
crucial in helping wrestlers engage directly with a devoted fan base. Key prefers to keep his 
social media presence “more character-driven” rather than sharing personal information. 
 
Key describes the challenges in finding a balance between his personal life and professional life. 
He touches on the financial aspect of pursuing a professional wrestling career, how the job 
affects his marriage, and what sacrifices are required throughout the process. His family has 
encouraged his pursuits.  
 
[00:37:10] Key reveals some of the more challenging aspects of working as a professional 
wrestler. “You’re not gonna make any money, for sure.” He mentions sacrificing time spent with 
family and missing important holidays and celebrations. Key’s days are often repetitive with the 
singular goal of becoming famous. “I guess I’m just a sick individual, but I like the grind.” 
Finding pleasure in training hard, learning, growing, and “being part of something so great.” Key 
also talks about aspects of performing that bring him joy.  
 
[00:40:02] Key reminisces on some of his stronger matches and those he used as learning 
opportunities. He remembers wrestling a tag-team match with his partner Maverick against The 
Rock ‘n’ Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson) in front of over 1,000 fans in Virginia. 
Several other legendary professional wrestlers were also in the audience. “We just did a really 
good job. They were entertained.” 
 
One of Key’s weaker matches was at a fairground where the match fell flat after several dropped 
spots. “It wasn’t necessarily a bad match, but I just remember how I felt after. I didn’t feel 
good.”  
 
[00:44:49] Key looks forward to the future and describes where his professional wrestling career 
is headed. “The main goal for Luscious Lawrence is to get a contract, so all I’ll have to do is 
worry about wrestling, and looking good, and going to the gym, and eating…” Providing for his 
family is Key’s ultimate goal. The independent circuit is also a legitimate way to earn a living.  
 
Key broaches the subject of building a brand centered on Luscious Lawrence through 
merchandising. Key’s wife is responsible for marketing, creating merchandise, and furthering 
Key’s professional wrestling image.  
 
[00:47:48] Key offers advice to those interested in becoming professional wrestlers. “Quit. Get 
out the business.” Key encourages wrestlers to take their craft seriously. The wrestling industry 
has become less secretive, but Key counts this as a positive. Consistency, dedication, and 
listening to veteran wrestlers is paramount to becoming a better wrestler. Key regrets not 
wrestling in high school or starting earlier than he did. The wrestling business is looking for

athletes who are more mature. “If you got the ‘it factor,’ you can do something.” Key also calls 
attention to promising up-and-coming wrestlers.  
 
[00:55:04] Key discusses his involvement with the PBS documentary series ​American Portrait​, 
which follows Key as he continues to make a name for himself in the wrestling industry. Key 
also speaks to how the coronavirus pandemic has affected the independent professional wrestling 
scene. He also feels positively about the future of indie wrestling and what it has to offer 
dedicated athletes.
