Dear Dr. Spivacke:
I was really ashamed to ask you for another extension of time on the recording machine
because you have been so generous to us. However, when I told Doctor Chatelain that
the fishing fleets had just come back to our vicinity after wintering off South Carolina, he
felt that his program in St. Augustine would like to have these songs. Knowing that Doctor
Leland was especially interested in the folklore section, I wrote him to ask if he considered
it important enough to ask for a further extension, and he has replied that you have again
granted this to us. I will hurry as much as possible to get this material. Please accept my
sincerest thanks for your kindness.
Gratefully yours, Carita D. Corse Dr. Carita Doggett Corse State Supervisor WPA Writers'
