Wild Bill Jones
WILD BILL JONES 4138 52A1
Troy Camberon Arvin, 1940
As I went out fer to take a little walk I walked upon that Wild Bill Jones He was walking and
a-talking, my true love sighed And forbid him to leave her alone.
My age is just twenty-one - Not fer to be controlled I drew my revolver from my side And
destroyed that poor boy's soul.
He kicked and he scrambled and he fell upon the ground And he gave one dyin' groan I
threw my arms round my little gal's neck Sayin' Baby you'll be left alone.
A dollar in my pocket And a forty-four in my hand Jes' come on boys let's have a little drink
For I have this money to spend.
Jes' pass around your long neck bottle And we'll all get on a spree For today is the last of
Wild Bill Jones And tomorrow'll be the last of me.
