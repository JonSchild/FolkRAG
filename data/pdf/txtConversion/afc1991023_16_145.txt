SUBJECT: 
Suggestions concerning the study of fur trapping in the New Jersey 
Pinelands Project 
I would like to suggest that in the forthcoming New Jersey Pinelands Folk-
life Project, a special effort be made to record the knowledge, skills, and 
values of fur trappers within the study area. 
This recommendation grows out 
of my understanding that the Pinelands Project intends to focus upon the 
interrelationship between traditional culture and the natural environment; I 
can think of no traditional activity that exhibits this interrelationship more 
clearly than that of fur trapping. 
There are other traditional occupations, 
of course, that bear a similar relationship to living natural resources: pro-
fessional fishermen, hunting guides, woodcutters, etc., and I would not wish 
my recommendations to deflect attention from any of these other people or 
activities. 
Moreover, I am sure that some of the thoughts expressed below 
have already occurred to those who are directly engaged in planning the 
study. 
My expectations for this memorandum are thus limited. 
Nevertheless, I 
hope I am correct in perceiving a small area of the project where the sharing 
of my impressions will be of interest and use. 
What I wish to do, specific-
ally, 
is to pass along two perceptions that grow out of association I have 
had with professional trappers in Delaware, Maryland, and Upstate New York, 
and to set down the implications these perceptions hold for the ethnographic 
study of fur trapping in New Jersey. 
I 
The first of these perceptions is the one already alluded to above: name-
ly, that many trappers are remarkable repositories of traditional knowledge of 
an ethnozoological/ethnobotanical sort. 
There are several reasons why this 
should be so. First, 
the trapper spends really a great deal of time outdoors. 
In the spring, summer, and fall, he scouts the countryside for trapping oppor-
tunities. 
During the three-month long trapping season, he tends his traps 
virtually every day — by law. 
Only the hardest freeze keeps him at home. 
Consequently, the trapper has an opportunity to observe wildlife behavior 
under a wider range of conditions than the other traditional outdoor profes-
sionals. 
Second, the trapper's image of the world is extremely fine grained. In 
the vastness of a tide marsh, he looks for the track of a mink no larger than 
a thumbprint. 
Where the fin-fisherman watches for the flash of baitfish on 
U 
BUY U.S. SAVINGS BONDS THROUGH THE PAYROLL PLAN 
the surface of the ocean, or looks across the broad horizon to find a cloud of 
feeding seabirds , 
the trapper searches the ground under his boots for the 
glint of a few dried fish scales — "otter vomit." 
The subject of otter vomit (regurgitated bits of bone, shell, hair, and 
other indegestible matter from muskrats, turtles, and fish) brings us, however 
abruptly, to a third source of the trapper's unusual environmental knowledge: 
namely, that the practice of trapping requires familiarity with the visceral 
side of life in the wild. 
The deer hunter, even a consistently successful 
one, can permit himself to enjoy a thoroughly romantic view of his quarry. The 
trapper, however, has no such luxury . His concerns are ingestive, excretive, 
and reproductive activities and their often maloderous, by-products. Moreover 
a trapper who skins and eviscerates, say, 100 muskrats a day for three or four 
months a year literally knows that species from the inside out. 
This is not 
unlike the tactile way in which a potter knows his ware, a way of knowing that 
is the envy ofthe connoisseur. 
The above comparison of the trapper to a steroetypical folk craftsman, 
the potter, brings to mind a fourth aspect of the knowledge residing in this 
occupation, and that aspect is what might be called its traditionality. 
Trap-
ping is a folk craft, and it is learned in the traditional way: Through the 
association of neophytes with those who have acquired the skill. 
The place to• 
see this most dramatically, perhaps, is in the establishment of a professional 
fur buyer. In addition to buying pelts from whomever may bring them to his 
door, the fur buyer often leases tracts of land which are then systematically 
trapped by young men who are, in everything but name, his apprentices. 
They 
learn to estimate the yield of a given tract so as to be able to bargain for 
lease fees and so as to conserve a breeding population. 
They learn something 
called "how to walk on a marsh." 
They learn the arcana of trap placement, 
scents, and baits. 
They learn the effects of ice and tides, and what may be 
safely attempted, and what not. 
They learn to sharpen skinning knives and to 
use the fleshing beam. 
They learn to grade furs at a glance, and they learn 
when and how to market them. 
Of course, not all trappers are associated with such a fur buying 
enterprise. Many trap by themselves, or with a close friend, and visit the fur 
buyer but once or twice a year with their catch. 
The traditional pattern 
holds, nevertheless: In virtually every case it will be found that these soli-
tary trappers started as young men and found an older relative or friend to 
introduce them to the craft. 
For the sake of conceptual clarity, it may be worth pointing out the 
distinction between the tradition of trapping in New Jersey and the 
history  
of trapping in New Jersey. 
The tradition, in my view, lies in the informal, 
intimate, manner in which the trapper's considerable knowledge is transmitted 
through time. 
The history, however, is the chronicle that could be written to 
record both the adventures of trappers and the changing importance of fur 
products throughout the period of European settlement of the state. Such a 
chronicle would be a long document. Furs were one of the commodities that 
brought Europeans to the Jersey coast in the 17th century. 
While it would be 
interesting to learn what, if anything, might be found that would recall that 
distant epoch, it may be safely presumed 
that the outlines of New Jersey 
trapping today were drawn in the mid-19th century with the Oneida Community's 
nationwide manufacture and marketing of the steel trap and with the post Civil 
War change in clothing fashion that reduced the demand for beaver among 
2 
fur commodities and increased the importance of muskrat and other short hair 
species. 
The history and the tradition of trapping may thus be examined inde-
pendently; yet, of course, they bear an obvious relationship to one another. 
Traditions require time to evolve and reflect history in their particular 
details. 
II 
The second perception concerning fur trapping that I would like to pass 
along is that trapping is, at this moment, and particularly in New Jersey, a 
subject of intensely emotional discussion. 
It would be difficult to think of 
another topic that so completely polarizes that sector of the public that is 
interested in the natural environment. 
While I am conscious of the hazzards 
of a Folklife Center field team becoming involved in a public squabble, I am 
also 
concerned that the Pinelands Project bring its resources to bear on the 
cultural outcroppings that will yield a clear understanding of the bedrock is-
sues. If the ultimate contribution evisioned for this study is its contribu-
tion to land-use planning, then it is issues of this incendiary sort that we 
will have to tackle. Reminiscences of bygone years and recipes for green 
tomato pie will not advance the cause that we have assigned ourselves this 
time. 
Trapping, better than any other folk practice I can think of, raises 
the kind of issues we want to understand. 
Trapping not only provides a handle on the issues in the Pine Barrens, 
it also presents the Folklife Center with an opportunity to do something help-
ful both for people who are attempting against all odds to live according to 
the dictates of their cultural traditions and for the people who must make 
decisions regarding the Pine Barrens future (two different groups). 
To 
grasp the nature of this opportunity, we must first concede that 
trapping is 
indeed a brutal, gory business. 
So also is farming, the practice of medicine, 
police work, and much else in life that is • a• 
indispensable to human 
happiness. The difference between fur trapping 
aM- thes-e other pursuits is 
that, during the last decade or so, the trapper has become the victim of a 
well financed campaign of villification. 
The pecuniary and psychological 
motives of the campaign leaders appear to be of the usual sort, and their 
accusations probably contain about as much truth as systematic efforts to 
stigmatize a group of people ever do, and their selection of victims who lack 
the means to reply in the same forum where they are being attacked is also 
customary. The trapper, of course, poses no threat to the Pine Barrens. 
But 
as long as public knowledge of him is in the hands of the professional 
stigmatizers, he can be made to seem the worst villain in the picture and thus 
divert energy and attention away from the real issues of preserving the 
habitat and the culture that has grown up upon it. 
What we can do in this situation is simply to record in a straight-
forward, ethnographically sophisticated manner, the skills and values of Pine 
Barrens trappers. This is, I believe, an occasion, not for advocacy, but for 
truthful reporting. The goal seems modest enough, and yet its value in bring-
ing 
a balanced perspective to public discourse concerning both cultural and 
environmental matters would be considerable. 
I have expressed above my view that the controversy surrounding fur 
trapping provides the Pinelands Project field team with an opportunity --act-
ually two opportunities: one, to concentrate attention on a matter that brings 
3 
into the open the different understandings of nature which must be reconciled 
in order for plans to be made concerning the region's future; the other to 
diffuse, through doing what we do best (ethnography), much unhealthy emotion 
with which public discussion of New Jersey environmental issues has lately 
been inoculated. 
In addition to this, or these, opportunities, it also seems 
to me that we encounter here in this beleaguered craft of trapping a certain 
obligation. 
If the study of folklife can be justified on any grounds it would 
have to be for its 
ability, in the midst of America's seething caldron of 
fashionable majorities, to hold up to serious scrutiny the saving remnants of 
traditional culture. To undertake this Pinelands study without making a 
special effort to document the trapper's craft (or worse, to accept meekly the 
definition of the trapper as some kind of untouchable and ignore him alto-
gether) would raise in my mind questions regarding the Center's sense of 
identification with the larger goals of folklife scholarship and would, I 
think, tend to mock the very idea of "cultural conservation" that we are going 
to New Jersey to demonstrate. 
To sum up, fur trapping in the New Jersey Pine Barrens may be thought 
of as an historic, traditional, highly elaborated, folk craft, the practice of 
which explicitly reveals convergent patterns of nature and culture. That 
organiztions whose vision is directed away from tradition and toward the mani-
pulation of mass media resources have lately made trapping a subject of heated 
debate gives the fieldworker good reason to pause before entering on a study 
of this activity. Nevertheless, by bringing to the surface deeply felt 
beliefs about nature and man's place in nature, this very controversy enriches 
the quality of the data to be derived from research concerning trapping in New 
Jersey. 
The controversy also affords the American Folklife Center two oppor-
tunities: one to fulfill its role as an instrument of cultural policy by pro-
viding ethnographic understanding of a matter of public concern, and another 
to demonstrate its commitment to an idea that folklorists have valued since 
the late 18th century -- the idea that our discipline contributes to the world 
at large by providing a conduit through which the wisdom and poetry of tradi-
tion may have a fair chance to be heard. 
One final consideration: 
the uproar around trapping enhances its value 
as a subject of research, but it doesn't make that research any easier. Field-
workers will probably find that trappers responses to researchers 
fall into 
one of two patterns: hyper-sensitivity to the possibility of negative publi-
city, or hyper-sensitivity to the possibility of 
positive publicity. In 
recent years, some trappers have formed organizations the leaders of which 
will be more than eager to cooperate with fieldworkers. These new organiza-
tions are interesting in and of themselves. 
They often provide a venue for 
songs, recitations, ephemeral graphics, and other expressive forms not unlike 
those to be found at the grassroots level in the early labor union movement. 
But to derive all of one's impressions of New Jersey trapping from such groups 
could be misleading. To get a good view of the trapper's landscape will re-
quire assistance from knowledgable guides. 
The addresses of a number of such 
people are given below, and I would like to urge that an effort be made to 
communicate with them as soon as possible during the pre-field phase of the 
project.

Maurice River 
• 
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS 
During August, and September and October, I propose to gather a 
limited amount of documentary information concerning railbirding on the 
Maurice River in southern New Jersey. 
The activities that I envision 
include 
1/Preparing a short bibliography. 
2/Communicating with one or more museum curators (such as Richard 
Dolesh of the Patuxent River Park, John Marshall of the Philadelphia 
Maritime Museum, Ralph Eshelman of the Calvert Marine Museum, and Bob 
Litzenberg of the Upper Bay Museum) in order to locate the important 
artifactual and archival collections relating to this activity. 
3/Conducting two interviews with Frank Astemborski of Delanco, New 
Jersey. 
4/Conducting two interviews with Jim Owings of Rockville, 
Maryland. 
5/Conducting two days of fieldwork on the Maurice River. 
6/Conducting one day of fieldwork on the Patuxent River. 
Because of limitations on the time of the two key informants, Mr. 
Astemborski and Mr. Owings, much of the data collection will have to be 
done in evenings and on weekends, and I accept the responsibility of 
doing this work in my own free time. 
My guess is that the actual time 
away from my normal duty station will total less than four days spread 
over the three month period. 
I volunteer to document Maurice River railbirding for several 
reasons: 
1/I have maintained a more-or-less academic interest in this old, 
but little known, outdoor tradition for many years and have a small 
collection of clippings, photos, and recorded interviews. 
2/I have located, in Mr. Astemborski and Mr. Owings, two very 
important informants.

3/The Maurice River is the last place in the United States where 
commercial railbird hunting guides exist. 
As far as I can tell, their 
traditional practices have not changed in a century and a half. 
The 
implications for the history of American outdoor traditions are thus 
apparent. 
4/Within the next year or two, the commercial guiding of railbird hunters 
will cease-- not for any lack of birds -- but because the last family of 
watermen who work as pushers are getting too old to continue this very 
strenuous work. 
The economic circumstances of our time which propel young men 
to seek employment in nine-to-five jobs, often far from the part of the country 
in which they grew up, preclude the possibility of a younger generation 
continuing the tradition. 
INTERRELATIONSHIP WITH THE AMERICAN FOLKLIFE CENTER'S 
NEW JERSEY PINELANDS PROJECT 
The facilities of the Archive of Folk Culture are mentioned by name 
in the memorandum of agreement between the Folklife Center and the New 
Jersey Pinelands Commission. 
Even if this were not so, there is a long 
history of Archive staff participation in field research. 
Although the 
exegencies brought about by the Archive's Growing Collection/Static 
Staff Problem necessarily keep us closer to our desks than in former 
times, a case could be made for the value of the Archive staff going 
into the field from time to time in order to gain practical familiarity 
with, and to recommend improvements in, the data gathering and archival 
techniques that inform collections that are destined to fall under our 
intellectual control. 
This value is especially apparent in the case of 
the Pinelands Project where the research design focuses on the 
experimental use of automation for the purposes of later retrieval. 
Indeed, it is my understanding that the Pinelands Project represents a 
significant advance toward the integration of data gathering and 
archival processing. 
Railbirding, for a variety of reasons, is an activity that 
reveals the relationship of nature and culture with particular clarity. 
This marks it as a subject full of potential for the 
objectives of the 
Pinelands Project -- both those relating to land-use policy and those 
relating to cultural interpretation. 
For the above reasons, I would seek to integrate my research with 
the database that of the Pinelands Project. 
I 
would also request that 
certain funds from the Pinelands Project budget be expended as 
indicated below under Expenditures. 
EXPENDITURES 
From the American Folklife Center monies set aside for the Pinelands 
Project research, I request that Mr. Owings and Mr. Astemborski each be 
offered a modest honorarium ($100 to $200) with which to defray the 
3 
travel and other expenses they will necessarily occur in helping me. 
I 
also request normal access to the supplies of film and recording tape 
that the Center has set aside for the Pinelands Project. 
I request that my own travel and per diem be sought from Library 
monies -- Fund 21A.-
PERSONNEL 
As my absence from the Library will work a hardship on the Archive, 
I request that some other Folklife Center staffinember be asked to 
fill-in for me during the several days in which I may be away. 
COMMENT BY JCH 
I heartily endorse this well thought out proposal 
and especially urge attention to the requests in the last two 
paragraphs: utilization of regular Library acquisition funds 
for Gerry's field work, and assignment of Center staff to 
cover in his absence. 
In regard to the first, we need to 
re-establish our access to Fund 21A for such short field 
trips; the memos requesting these funds need to be carefully 
worded. 
As for the second, Gerry is cognizant of the rather 
busy meeting schedule of Center staff during September and 
October, and assures me he will not conflict with any of 
these dates.

MEMO DRAFT 
Alan Jabbour, Director 
American Folklife Center 
Gerald Parsons 
Reference Librarian 
Proposal to document fresh water rail bird hunting on New Jersey's 
Maurice (pron. "morris") River 
THE GAME 
There are six species of the genus raillidae in the United States. 
Of these, the Yellow rail (Coturnicops noveborocensis) and the Black 
rail (Cricicus jamaicensis) are too small to qualify as game birds. At 
the other end of the scale of rails, the two pound Clapper (Rallus 
longirostris) is not only the largest of the six, but a most interest-
ing fellow whose nests, I have come to believe, were the source of many 
Early American Omlettes and of many "Egg Islands," that dot the 
Atlantic coast. 
The Clapper is a bird of the short-grass salt marshes, 
and although he is hunted fairly extensively, his habitat and the trad-
itions associated with bringing him to table are other than those I 
wish to focus on here. 
Back up in the tidal estuary, where the grass is too high and the 
water too fresh for the Clapper's taste, live the 
the King rail 
(Rallus elegans), the Virginia rail (Rallus limicola limicola) and the 
Sora rail (Porzana carolina). 
Especially the Sora. 
2 
The Sora rail is small (7 oz.), fat, delicious, handsome, plenti-
ful, and odd. 
In fact, Soras are among the oddest birds going. One day 
they will be in the marsh like bees in a honeysuckle. 
The next day 
there is not one to be found. 
I have several times been told in all 
seriousness that "when that happens, they go down in the mud and turn 
to frogs." Soras migrate from the Maritimes to Central America, but 
they flush before the gun like a bat suffering from terminal arthritus. 
Tom Marshall, a famous old railbirder of the Housatonic, wrote of 
their unstylish flight "when they decide to drop down, they point both 
wings to the sky and just let go" (Camp 219). 
When the tide is filling 
the marsh, the Sora will flush. 
Once the tide turns and starts to ebb, 
they won't. 
How they perceive that this change has occurred, or what 
difference it could possibly make to them, is anybody's guess. 
Then 
there is their mocking, lunatic call -- liberal use of which is made in 
the otherwise quiet moments after a missed shot. 
They are, of course, 
thin as a rail (front elevation), and they scamper across the surface 
of the water on unwebbed feet. 
If circumstances require, they are 
happy to swim on the water like a duck, or swim under water like a 
fish. 
They will also walk under water on the marsh bottom like no 
other creature at all. 
They are found mainly in wild rice meadows, but 
as Maryland hunter Bob Litzenberg told me, "I've killed thousands of 
the things and I've never found a grain of rice in one -- in fact, I've 
never found anything in any one of them's gullet. I don't know what 
they eat. 
But they must eat something." 
3 
A Philadelphia sportsman of the 1840's, John Krider, recorded 
other curious behaviors attributed to the Sora. In his Sporting  
Anecdotes (Philadelphia, 1853), Krider says he has been told that rails 
are "occasionally subject to epileptic fits superinduced by paroxysms 
of of rage or fear" (p.133). 
He doubts the truth of this (one would 
have to wonder what it would take to infuriate a railbird), but 
declares himself "now ready to endorse the assertion, that the whole 
family of the rails are --travelling ventriloquists." (authors ital. p. 
136) 
Rails not only throw their voices about the marsh, says Krider, 
but uninjured rails are inclined to feign death at the report of a gun. 
These later abruptly reduce the game bag by flying off the boat, or in 
some cases, revive to become novel pets of the sportman's household. 
Then Krider reports instances of the converse -- rails mysteriously 
dying without cause. 
In one particularly dramatic case of this sort, a 
sportsman was pushed onto the marsh and fired at the first bird to fly 
up before him. As often happened with the percussion lock fowling 
pieces of the day, when the trigger was pulled, the cap exploded on the 
nipple, but the charge of powder did not detonate. 
That would not be 
remarkable except that at the feeble bang of the cap, the rail fell 
stone dead. "...the shooter... after examining the bird, directed Dennis 
to put back for the ferry declaring that he would shoot no 
more....'From what I could hear,' said the pusher, 'I believe he has 
never been out since.'" 
(p.134) "The disposition of the rail is 
strongly marked by petulance and curiosity," he says (p.138), and he 
4 
reports (as others have told me) that rails 
may be summoned out onto a 
mud bank from the grasses that usually hide them by knocking on the 
gunwale of the boat with an rowlock or other small metal object. 
For all of the above reasons, the Sora and his larger cousins have 
fascinated generations of Eastern sportsmen. 
The typical hunting 
method requires a skilled "pusher" to propel a specially designed skiff 
through the "oats" (Zinzania aquatica, "wild rice") 
with a 14- to 
16-foot pushpole. 
The gunner stands toward the bow of the boat and 
fires at the birds that take flight before him. 
There is much 
judgement required in timing the shot: . too soon and the bird will be 
obliterated. 
Too late and the bird will be down in the marsh before 
the trigger is pulled. Safe gun handling is also a prominent concern of 
the gunner, but perhaps his greatest challenge is that of keeping the 
rocking, surging, boat beneath him. 
Thankfully, Sora migrations (and 
Sora shooting) occur during the relatively warm months of September and 
October; two months later and the death toll from hypothermia would be 
staggering. 
"Staggering" is, of course, an exaggeration. 
There are just not 
that many railbirders. 
Nor have there ever been a great many devotees 
of this activity. 
True, in years past (certainly up until World War II 
worked its magic on American traditional life), the 
Housatonic, the 
Connecticut, the Cohansey, the Maurice, the Patapsco, the Patuxent, and 
the James could all boast substantial fleets of rail skiffs. 
People 
who remember the old days on the Patuxent have told that the two hours 
5 
before the turn of a good September tide "would sound like a young 
war." 
Twenty-five boats on a 1,000 acre marsh apparently would not be 
unusual. 
Even so, railbirding has never drawn even a fraction of the 
followers that waterfowling has. 
Says Tom Marshall 
Rail shooting in this country, even in muzzle-loading 
days, has been limited to sportsmen who hunted them 
purely for pleasure. 
Seldom were rail shot for the 
market; 
powder and shot were expensive, and the small 
size of the birds prevented their being sold for enough 
to pay for the shot discharged. 
The rails' habit of 
never bunching up in flocks made it impractical to use 
the big guns that raised such havoc with our shorebirds. 
Some were attracted by lights and caught in nets, but 
the number taken by this method was so limited that few 
were found in the market when it was legal to sell 
wildfowl. 
In spite of the liberal season- and 
bag-limits, and the wide distribution of different rail 
in this country, the number of sportsmen who hunt them 
is small (208). 
"So why isn't this sport more popular?" my wife asked after 
downing her first mouthful of a Patuxent River railbird fried in 
butter. 
The answer lies at the end of the boat opposite the gunner. 
There are many things in this world that require skill. 
There are many 
6 
things in this world that require backbreaking labor. 
There are only a 
few things that require both skill and back breaking labor at the same 
time. 
Pushing a railbird skiff is one of those things. 
The pusher must keep the boat moving fast enough to startle the 
birds into flight. He must call the shots ("Mark left!" 
"Mark 
ahead! "). 
He must beat the likely looking stands of grass with his 
push pole. He must mark the falls against landmarks on the horizon and 
by throwing bright marker buoys toward them. 
He must spot the downed 
bird in the water, keep the boat steady, watch out for other gunners on 
the marsh, and keep his gunner from overshooting the,25 bird limit.

In his mind, the pusher must carry a map of the marsh that is far 
more detailed than any he could purchase from the U.S. Geological 
Survey. What he sees before him is not a featureless plain of ten foot 
high, pale green grass, but rather a topography of "high" lands and 
"low," of invisible channels, 
of patches of "floating marsh" (bad 
stuff), and of tracts that often hold birds and indentical tracts that 
usually do not. 
Moreover the pusher's mental map is one that must 
stand revision, not only as the river changes, but as the wind changes. 
As a rule, an offshore breeze holds down the height of the tide and 
empties the marsh faster. 
An onshore breeze usually pushes more water 
back into the estuary and holds it there longer. 
But every marsh has 
its own peculiar ways with the tide and its own ways of signalling to 
the knowing observer the amount and duration of the flow.

Given the pleasures of railbird shooting (and eating), the 
pusher's recondite abilities are a valuable commodity. 
People who lack 
the skills and strength, but who can afford to pay for them, have done 
so, often quite handsomely. Accordingly the classic picture of 
railbirding in this country has been that of the city gentleman 
(frequently gentlewoman) sportsman occupying the forequarter of the 
skiff while the stern is commanded by some broad-shouldered amphibian 
who would call himself a "mud-wholloper" and be proud of it.

prominence, and ceremony that their former employers brought to the 
railbirding grounds.

by some eminent person who has kept in touch long after the railbirding

It is my impression that the lines of communication in this 
activity have often taken the shape of an hourglass: a local 
storekeeper, dock owner or whatever, receives the out-of-town 
sportsmens' requests to book a tide and then passes these on to the 
pushers. 
Mrs. Edna Greenwell served the Patuxent River pushers in that 
capacity for decades. 
She told me that she acquired that role when she 
and her husband installed a telephone in their Pig Point bait and 
sandwich shop before anyone else in the area had one.

of nature, railbirding has had an important calendrical dimension. On

these, and on the first of September he started pushing for railbirds.

seine hauling, rough carpentry, and other odd jobs.

numbers, the riverman's way of life is a thing of the past.

Proposal to document fresh water rail•hird huntin'• on New Jersey 
Maurice (pron. "morris") River 
THE GAME 
There are six species of the genus raillidae in the United States. 
Of these, the Yellow rail (Coturnicops noveborocensis) and the Black 
rail (Cricicus jamaicensis) are too small to qualify as game birds. At 
the other end of the scale of rails, the two--pound Clapper (Rallus 
longi.rostris) is not only the largest of the six, but a most interest — 
ing fellow whose nests, I have come to believe, were the source of many 
rt4l,• 
Early American Omlettes and of many "Egg Islands," that Adot the 
Atiantic coast. 
The Clapper is a bird of the short—grass salt marshes, 
and although he is hunted fairly extensively, his habitat and the trad— 
itions associated with bringing him to table are other than those I. 
wish to focus on here. 
Back up in the tidal estuary, where the grass is too high and the 
water too fresh for the Clapper's taste, live the --t-4e King rail 
(Rallus elegans), the Virginia rail (Rallus limicola limicola) and thF. 
Sora rail (Porzana carolina). 
Especially the Sora. 
2 
The Sora rail is small (7 oz.), fat, delicious, handsome, plenti— 
ful, and odd. 
In fact, Soras are among the oddest birds going. One day 
they will be in the marsh like bees in :i 
honeysuckle. 
The -iext day 
there is not one to be found. 
I have several times been told in all 
seriousness that "when that happens, they go down in the mud and turn 
to frogs." Soras migrate from the Maritimes to Central America, but 
they flush before the gun like a bat suffering from terminal arthritus. 
Tom Marshall, a famous old railbirder of the Housatonic, wrote of 
their unstylish flight "when they decide to drop down, they point both 
wings to the sky and just let go" (Camp 219). 
When the tide is filling 
the marsh, the Sora will flush. 
Once the tide turns and starts to ebb, 
they won't. 
How they perceive that this change has occurred, or what 
difference it could possibly make to them, is anybody's guess. 
Then 
there is their mocking, lunatic call -- liberal use of which is made in 
the otherwise quiet moments after a missed shot. 
They are, of course, 
thin as a rail (front elevation), and they scamper across the surface 
of the water on unwebbed feet. 
If circumstances require, they are 
happy to swim on the water like a duck, or swim under water like a 
fish. 
They will also walk under water on the marsh bottom like no 
other creature at all. 
They are found mainly in wild rice meadows, but 
as Maryland hunter Bob Litzenberg told me, "I've killed thousands of 
the things and I've never found a grain of rice in one -- in fact, I've 
never found anything in any one of them's gullet. I don't know what 
they eat. 
But they must eat something." 
A Philadelphia sportsman of the 184u's, John Krider, recorded 
other curious behaviors attributed to the Sora. 
In his Sporting  
Anecdotes (Philadelphia, 1853), Krider says he has been told that rails 
are "occasionally subject to epileptic fits superinduced by paroxysms 
of of rage or fear" (p.133). 
lie doubts the truth of this (one would 
have to wonder what it would take to infuriate a railbird), but 
declares himself "now ready to endorse the assertion, that the whole 
family of the rails are -- travelling ventriloquists." (authors ital. p. 
136) 
Rails not only throw their voices about the marsh, says Krider, 
but uninjured rails are inclined to feign death at the report of a gun. 
These later abruptly reduce the game bag by flying off the boat, or in 
some cases, revive to become novel pets of the sportman's household. 
Th-en Krider Areports instances of the converse -- rails mysteriously 
dying without cause. 
In one particularly dramatic case of this sort, a 
sportsman was pushed onto the marsh and fired at the first bird to fly 
up before him. As often happened with the percussion—lock fowling 
pieces of the day, when the trigger was pulled, the cap exploded on the 
nipple, but the charge of powder did not detonate. 
That would not be 
remarkable except that at the feeble bang of the cap, the rail fell 
stone dead. "...the shooter... after examining the bird, directed Dennis 
to put back for the ferry declaring that he would shoot no 
more....'From what I could hear,' said the pusher, 
'I believe he has 
never been out since.'" 
(p.134) "The disposition of the rail is 
strongly marked b 
lk% ``,_ 
y petulance and curiosity," kr says (p.138), and he 
4 
reports (as others have told me) that rails 
may be summoned out onto a 
mud bank from the grasses that usually hide them by knocking on the 
gunwale of the boat with an rowlock or other small metal object. 
For all of the above reasons, the Sora and his larger cousins have 
fascinated generations of Eastern sportsmen. 
The typical hunting 
method requires a skilled "pusher" to propel a specially designed skiff 
through the "oats" (Zinzania aquatica, "wild rice") 
with a 14- to 
16-foot pushpole. 
The gunner stands toward the bow of the boat and 
fires at the birds that take flight before him. 
There is much 
judgement required in timing the shot: 
too soon and the bird will be 
obliterated. 
Too late and the bird will be down in the marsh before 
the trigger is pulled. Safe gun handling is also a prominent concern of 
the gunner, but perhaps his greatest challenge is that of keeping the 
rocking, surging, boat beneath him. 
Thankfully, Sora migrations (and 
Sora shooting) occur during the relatively warm months of September and 
October; two months later and the death toll from hypothermia would be 
staggering. 
"Staggering" is, of course, an exaggeration. 
There are just not 
that many railbirders. 
Nor have there ever been a great many devotees 
of this activity. 
True, in years past (certainly up until World War II 
worked its magic on American traditional life), the 
Housatonic, the 
Connecticut, the Cohansey, the Maurice, the Patapsco, the Patuxent, and 
the James could all boast substantial fleets of rail skiffs. 
People 
who remember the old days on the Patuxent have told that the two hours 
5 
before the turn of a good September tide "would sound like a young 
war." 
Twenty—five boats on a 1,000 acre marsh apparently would not be 
unusual. 
Even so, railbirdirig has never drawn even a fraction of the 
followers that waterfowling has. 
Says Tom Marshall 
Rail shooting in this country, even in muzzle--loading 
days, has been limited to sportsmen who hunted them 
purely for pleasure. 
Seldom were rail shot for the 
market; 
powder and shot were expensive, and the small 
size of the birds prevented their being sold for enough 
to pay for the shot discharged. 
The rails' habit of 
never bunching up in flocks made it impractical to use 
the big guns that raised such havoc with our shorebirds. 
Some were attracted by lights and caught in nets, but 
the number taken by this method was so limited that few 
were found in the market when it, was legal to sell 
wildfowl. 
In spite of the liberal season-- and 
bag—limits, and the wide distribution of different rail 
in this country, the number of sportsmen who hunt them 
is small (208). 
"So why isn't this sport more popular?" my wife asked after 
downing her first mouthful of a Patuxent River railbird fried in 
butter. 
The answer lies at the end of the boat opposite the gunner. 
There are many things in this world that require skill. 
There are many 
things in this world that require backbreaking labor. 
There are only a 
few things that require both skill and back breaking labor at the same 
time.

birds into flight. He must call the shots ("Mark left!"
