LITTLE BUNCH OF ROSES
Darling, we must part forever; Hold me closer to your heart. At the dawning of the morning,
You and I will have to part.
Take this little bunch of roses That you gave me years ago; I have kissed them and
caressed them, But I'll never kiss them more.
When the shades of night are falling On this dark and lonely lea, And the whippoorwill is
singing; Won't you then remember me?
Sung by Mrs. Grace Lungino, Huntsville, Texas, May, 1939.
