Notes on talks and Interview with Karl Knorr 
P. 1 
When commenting on log buildings, Karl called saddle notching 
saddle and rider", square notching "flat dovetail - they don't hold 
together, you have to nail them". His uncle v;as a skilled "1 orman" 
who could dovetail in such a way that the logs locked together'with- 
out needing nails. 
The original Knorr Ranch was on the site of the present Green Mountain 
Reservoir. Some of the log buildings built by his father and grand¬ 
father (Guyselman, his mother's father) were saved and moved to their 
present location on logs and sleds in the winter of 1942/43, before 
the reservoir was created. 
'^e_ranc*1 now ^as a^°ut 300 cows. Beginning June 1st they are grazed 
on Forest Service Land, the William River Mountain (nicknamed Blue 
Ridge Allotment); the cattle drive is about 6 miles long around the 
dam and the cows get there within a day. Before and after the grazing 
when the cows are gathered again in the fall, they spend a few days ” 
of transition in a cow camp, a fenced-in area of about 40 acres. 
In this country nobody stays out with the cows, except maybe for fun. 
The Knorr Bros, brands are: 
Flying Diamond 
dating about 1940 
Lazy Kover, Lazy V/ 
dating about 1900 
by William Knorr 
Other ranch work consists of irrigation beginning in May, when the 
snow is gone, to raise a hay crop. The oldest water rights go back 
to about 1880 and they have plenty of water here, nice big creeks 
from the mountains: Gatarac, Ot*ter, Black Creek. His father built 
some ditches, others were even built before.

Notes on talks and interview with Karl Knorr 
The land is all glacier moraine, full of rocks, and the rule is, 
according to Karl: "Hay what you can, miss what’s too tough." 
The meadows are indeed full of small islands of tall grass^hiding 
rocky areas that are avoided by the hay crews. 
When asked about the possibility to stop haymaking because of rain, 
Karl commented: "It's like old Ben Franklin used to. say, 'Make hay 
when the sun shines', and I've found no better substitute." 
Much hay has to be raised to feed the cattle for six months during 
the severe winter here in the high Rockies. Karl does not do much 
work besides feeding the cattle every day during the winter, except 
to go over the machinery. But in the spring all the jobs happen at 
once, the fences have to be mended where elk has gone through, 
meadows have to be irrigated and the new calfs are branded in'May 
before going out to graze. 
Branding is now done by propane torch, rather than using a wood fire. 
At the same time his calfs are earmarked and a double sertim is 
administered against malignant edema and black leg. The male calfs 
are castrated with a short blade knife. The testicles are collected 
and later cooked and eaten as "Rocky Mountain oysters". Additionally 
the calfs are de-horned by applying a paste. 
Karl's father immigrated to the area to avoid military service in 
Germany. Because of my German background, he brought out the photo 
of a distant German relative, a young woman named »Elke' who had 
written to him in an effort to keep contact; an older photo from 
Germany, dating about 1930, shows the family of his father's brother, 
August Knttrr, at P.iederkapp, Germany. He seemed interested in his 
German background, but apparently has never made an effort to visit 
Germany or to meet his relatives there.

* Marshall's rough notes on the tape 
for Barbara Orbach; this is not the log. 
Colorado project — 1980 
Dub made of tape recording C080-B0-R1 25 Nov 80 by Marshall. 
General description of contents of this tape: 
Reel-to-reel tape recording number C080-B0-R1. Made on Nagra E (full track 
monophonic, with Sennheiser mike). Howard W. Marshall assisted with recording, 
and did photography. Tape speed 7% ips. 
Subject: Mrs. I.W. (Vera) McKee— irrigating hay meadow on land leased 
from Wheaton College (Iowa). West side of Blue River, on edge 
of Arapahoe National Forest, just off Colo. Highway 9, Summit Co. 
Interviewed by Barbara Orbach. Recordist duty shared by Orbach and Marshall. 
TIME ON ORIGINAL TAPE COUNTER 
1:00 Vera discusses the property; leased land from the college. 
1:30 It's called a "hay meadow." Grazing land for cattle that has to be 
carefully irrigated / watered. This meadow was never cleared of 
sagebrush; apparently was always open (at least in memory: HM). 
McKees have "60 pair and two bulls" grazing here (60 pair = cows and 
their calves). Cattle bought from Wayne Brown, Limon, who hauls them 
in to the McKee Ranch in the fall; McKees feed them and sell them 
later on the market. 
There is a "big hay meadow on top" of the hill above this hay meadow. 
This hay meadow elevation c. 9100 feet. Elevation of their ranch 8200

Fence divides AraphoANational Forest from the College's property; 
A 
it forms boundary line that runs through the trees. 
Ranches lease land from the Forest Service exclusively in this part 
of the valley; all the"BLM"(Bureau of Land Management, Department of 
Interior: HM) land has been moved into Forest Service (Department 
of Agriculture) jurisdiction and control for convenience of operation. 
5:00 "holes" = outlets Vera is closing and opening along the downhill 
side of the main big ditch bringing water down from the creek. She 
works along the ditch with a long-handled shovel, digging out holes 
where she wants water to go out and filling in other holes with 
mud / dirt she digs up when she encounters a smaller ditch that 
★ 
she wants closed off. 
Discussion of the irrigation method. Water comes from Boulder 
Crik (Creek). There is one large "diversion" (diversion ditch) 
at Boulder Creek with a gate and measuring point ("measuring box": HM) 
where the water comes out to feed other ditches further along. 
7:00 "water right" discussed. Important feature in ranching.... 
Plentiful water here in this area, but others use it too, such as 
local cities and the Denver Water Board. 
9:00 This is a dry year. 
11:00 B0 takes over the Nagra and microphone outfit to continue the recording 
HM began. 
13:00 Vera grew up in Texas (they movdd here from Breckenrldge, TX: HM); 
father a farmer. They like ranching, working in the open. 
She works daily with the water this time of year. Most of the work 
is done in the spring however. 
shovel type used in Nevada ranching, and elsewhere (HM) 
Marshall notes on C080-B0-R1

15:00 Shovel is the only tool necessary for changing water / irrigation. 
But tractor and implement does the heavy "cleaning" of the 
ditches (periodically: HM). Vera works alone, mostly, and likes 
it (accompanied by her dog; name "Tiger?": HM). 
16:00 Fencing takes two people (spring work). 
17:00 She learned to irrigate here in Colorado; not done back in Texas. 
Learned by "trial and error." 
"We both love this kind of work." (They'd like to ranch full-time, but 
it is not economically possible; IW McKee drives dump truck: HM) 
The recording is being made as Vera works along the ditch, "changing water." 
19:00 Water flows by gravity through ditch system, over / into the hay meadow. 
20:00 They buy their hay from neighboring ranchers, so they don't have 
to put up their own. Hay is cheaper to buy from ranchers if you 
buy it in the field (already baled but not moved: HM). Costs more 
if you buy it from ranch after it has been transported back to his 
ranch; would cost still more if delivered to your own place (HM). 
23:00 We walk along the main ditch to the higher hay meadow; Vera wanted 
us to see it. "It's beautiful." (And it is indeed; also contains 
the wreckage of a saddle-notched log field barn which HM recorded 
for the architectural record.) 
24:00 vegetataion discussed, and description is begun by Vera. Samples 
taken by HM & B0. Brome, clover, _ (Vera can't remember name 
of third grass we see at this point. Later we get more specimens and 
identify them.) 
Marshall notes on C080-B0-R1

26:00 Fencing description: brief discussion. Barbed wire fences are 
put at the edge of aspens (with steel posts or homemade wooden 
posts they make); aspens grow thickly as young trees and help 
provide an effective barrier to the grazing cattle. 
Spring is the time of fence building, repairing (just like in 
Frost... and like with ranchers & farmers everywhere: HM). 
27:00 Her dad worked by the signs. But Vera does not. He did many 
things by the moon phases ("by the signs")--hog killing, fence 
making, gardening / planting, etc. 
* Vera does not go by the signs, but she is very aware of them 
and aware of the real utility of this seemingly-obsolete custom. 
"I know that the sign for the garden works." —The case of the 
peas that wouldn't grow (father in TX; peas; old man taught him 
about using the signs....). (Important narrative, important 
material; HM.) 
"It's true." It works. 
Carrots, lettuce, turnips can be grown in a garden here (high altitude 
mountain environment), but the growing season is really too short 
(and the soils wrong: HM) for good gardens. 
31:00 Temperature was 31 degrees at the ranch this morning. (20Aug80) 
32:00 Discussion of plants; tape ends. (MATERIAL CONTINUES ON NEXT TAPE)
