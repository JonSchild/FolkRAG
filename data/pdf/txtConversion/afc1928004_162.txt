PREFACE 
TO NED TURNER'S NEW SONGSTER. 
WnonvEn of our readers have, for ever so short a 
stay, sojourned in 
southern climes, where " balmy breezes" temper the night air, and 
gaudy sunbeams radiate the day, cannot fail to have become sensible 
of the comicalities of negro life and negro originality. 
Passionately 
allied to the 
" 
Concord of sweet sounds," 
their very life and every thought seem bound up in its display, the 
plantation rnatin bell waking them from their rush-covered huts to 
catch up a 
hasty repast—a 
few indispensable hoe-cakes buttered with 
molasses, and a few snatches at the monotonous " corn doodle" or 
vocal cane. 
Their day's toil is o'er, their evening meal gone through 
with, and again sounds the weird notes of the corn doodle, and the 
sweet airy tones of the violin and banjo- A gala night is the time to 
view negro transitions in all their att.active jollity and their over-
done phrases, when the fiddle, Jawbone, Banjo, Bones, Tamborive and 
other minor instruments constitute the dance, and set the ebon dan-
senses upon their feet, and the gallants awaken to the sense of their 
delicate duties. 
From youth, his intuitive love for melody teaches 
the negro to mock the birds of his native pond bushes, and to amuse 
himself with imitations of domesticated beasts. 
That there are elements in his compositions to amuse and to attract 
is abundantly shown by the interest evinced by the public in the 
imitations of him presented to them by the entermising members of 
the profession of Ethiopian Minstrelsy. 
Among tlie favored by 
genius of this class of comedians stands quite at its head -NED TURNER, 
and all who have listened to the unctuous outbursts of his wit, and 
the melody of his songs, ii ill back us in the foregoing statement. As 
a 
gentleman he ranks high in his profession, and has ever been known 
to comport himself in a 
manner justly to warrant the respect and the 
estimation of all who have known him. A man should always so be 
atilt especially a public servant, one on whom the interests of the 
mass is settled, and therefore it may not be a matter extraodinary; 
but must we discover the contrary in order more properly to appre-
ciate the commendable points of a 
man's character. For years ho 
traveled with minstrel bands, and with them performed in many of the 
principal Cities and Towns in the United States, Canada, and the West 
India Islands, everywhere meeting with merited success— his unique 
compositions producing unbounded roars of laughter. The following 
pages containa portion of his numerous songs and sayings, fraught 
with laughter-stirring wit and pleasantries. 
Yours truly 
G. E. G. 
MATILDA STRAWBERRY. 
A s 
Sung by N ED TURNER. 
INTRODUCTION. 
Now darkies here we are assembled all, 
To please the ladies and gentlemen in this hall, 
'Then flying from grief, we'll sing let us be gay, 
And send Dan Tucker supperless away, 
Not e'en invite him in our minstrel but. 
To wait till Jennie gets her hoe-cake done. 
Then shake the Bones, and strike the Tambo, too, 
And show the white folks all what we can do. 
You may talk about the big sunflower, 
The gal that winked at me; 
But I 
declare none can compare 
With Matilda Strawberry. 
This Turtle-dove I 
dearly love, 
To tne I 
know she's true ; 
She's six feet tall, her feet are small, 
She wears a 
sixteen shoe. 
CHOffuS. 
Salute your partners, down the middle, 
Take this darkie's hand ; 
Sound the banjo, hear the fiddle, 
She's the prettiest in de land. 
She's pretty and she's learned, too, 
She's been to boarding school; 
She's handsome as an elephant, 
And graceful as a 
mule. 
When we walk out, we're talked about, 
We are the belle and beau ; 
Oh. I 
look neat. and she looks sweet 
In yellow calico. 
Salute your partners, &c. 
I'm happy as the day is long, 
For she is all my own ; 
I'm going to cork my charmer up, 
And sell her for cologne. 
Iler eves are.bright, she's my delight, 
She's happy, gay and tree; 
Oh, it is true. what I 
tell you 
Of Matilda Strawberry. 
Salute your partners, Scc. 
THAT'S WHAT'S THE MATTER, 
As Sang by NED TURNER. 
Good-evening, white folks, one and all, 
I've just come out to make a 
call, 
To dance and sing with all my might, 
And throw myself clean out of sight. 
And try and please you all to- night, 
And that's what's the matter. 
CIIORUS . 
Laugh and s:ng all the day, 
Jump around and have your nlay ; 
For there's nothing like a 
holiday, 
Upon the old plantation. 
In a 
little log hut in old Virginia, 
Where mother lived when she came from Guinea, 
She said I 
was the only son, 
And my age was twenty-one ; 
And that I 
had just begun 
To know what was the matter. 
Laugh and sing, &c. 
Now white folks my song is done, 
And I 
have had a 
little fun, 
To dance and sing is my delight, 
I 
hope I've done it up all right; 
I'll call and sing some other night, 
Oh, that's what's the matter. 
Laugh and sing, &c. 
SKIP-PI-TY, NIP-PI-TY, SLACK DO LAEL. 
As Sung by NED TURNER. 
I 
will sing you a 
song of a 
beautiful maid, 
Who had a 
large fortune, for so it was said. 
Iler dad's name was Brown,and his first name was William, 
With a 
head just the shape of a 
big watermellon. 
CIIORUS.

With my benah go slather and tic dolour-u, 
I 
never see such a 
sight in all my life, — 
As de time when I 
tried to make her my wife. 
De folk dey all said, dat when she went to bed, 
Dat curious things went right straight through her head, 
She thought she was great with her wonderfu: pate, 
And she said that the country was in a 
bad state, 
With my skip-pi-ty, & c. 
Says she, I 
will run against Benjamin Butler, 
Because loosing so many spoons put us in a !hitter, 
But in eating beefsteak, she made it mistake, 
It !kw to her head, and it busted her pate. 
With my skip-pi-ty, nip-pi-ty, slack do lab,

TURNER'S TELEGRAPH SONG. 
As Sung by NED TURNER. 
There was 
Susy Drown" and the " Girl front Jersey," 
Old " Nancy Fat," that had the scurvy, 
" 
Captain Jiuks" setting things topsy turvy, 
All " Walking down Broadway," 
There's " Old Bob Ridley" and the " Guinea-pig boy," 
Loth singing " Larboard Watch, ahoy;" 
" 
Champagne Charlie" was sang with joy, 
So says the Telegraph. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, funny things come o'er the wires, 
Of all the news that does transpire, 
Of telling lies they never tire; 
A big thing is the Telegraph. 
"Nell the belle" " Danced like a 
charm," 
Leaning on " Nicodemus Johnsow's" arm; 
" 
The gal with the waterfall" came in great alarm, 
Crying" Who'll have me now ?" 
"Dan Tucker" seized upon a 
chair, 
Caught " Polly Ann" right by the back hair, 
" 
Drowned ' her in the " Lakes of Kildare," 
5) says the Telegraph. 
Oh, funny things, &c. 
" 
Dandy Pat' and " Tho Dig Sunflower," 
" 
Making Love " in " Jenny Gray's" bower; 
In rushed " The Grocery Merchant" and Brown, the rower, 
With the " Saber of my Father" killed them both. 
For " A 
dollar or Two " I'll have to send; 
4` 
Pompey Moore" won't " The Cheese-knife" lend, 
" 
A ladies' man " ate a 
plate of" Grecian Bend,' 
So says the Telegraph. 
Oh, funny things. &c. 
"My Pretty Jemima " caught the croup, 
" 
At the " Irishman's shanty" eating soup, 
" 
Crazy Peg" made a 
tent of her hoop, 
"That's where the laugh comes in." 
" 
Rail Columbia," " Right side up side," 
On the Beach at Long Branch," " By the Sea-side," 
A song and dance at " Betsy Baker's" bedside, 
So says the Telegraph. 
Oh,trinny things, &c.

NED, THE LADIES' PET. 
As St
Illg by NED TUT..N.M:. 
Oh, listen to me while I 
do sing, 
The great sensation of the age; 
And I 
will try and please you if I 
can, 
Your attention to engage. 
I 
suppose you all have heard of me, 
So pray then don't forget 
That I 
travel under the cognomen 
Of Ned, the Ladies' Pet. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the ladies now-a-days, 
t 
They have such winning ways, 
• 
But it you are in trouble, 
You never need to fret ; 
As long as you are acquainted with 
Young Nett, the Ladies' Pet. 
.3 
Oh, how I 
do wish I 
was a 
big sunflower, 
Or lovely as a 
rose , 
Or if 1 
was some sweet perfumery, 
lick! to the ladies' nose. 
For it the ladies only like your style, 
Your bottom dollar bet; 
You won't need money, for don't you see ? 
You. are the Ladies' Pet. 
Oh, the ladies, tte. 
If you could only lay your eyes 
Upon my gal, that charming Fanny Snow, 
You'd be enchanted with the dazzling 
Glances that she does bestow. 
Her teeth are ‘vhite as marble, 
Her hair as black as jet ; 
But I 
know she loves me, for she says 
I 
am the Ladies' Pet. 
Oh, the ladies, &c. 
UNCLE SAM. 
As 
sung by N ED TURNER. 
There is an independent chap that lives this side the water, 
To serve a 
friend or beat a 
foe, he is a 
regular snorter; 
He keeps an open house to all, to all gives invitation, 
To enter in and taste the sweets of freedom wid de nation, 
in the year of '76, his daddy made him mad, sir, 
By trying to impose on him, so he licked his dad, sir ; 
His daddy's name was Johnny Bull, who at him kept on 
pickin', 
Until the year 1812, when he got another lickin'. 
The Southerners they did secede, so into them he pitches, 
And Grant and Sherman down he sends who licks 'em out 
der britches ; 
If any other nation tries, while thinking him a 
noodle, 
To tread upon his corns, he'll give them Yankee Doodle 
Although he's young he's mighty big and daily growing 
bigger, 
And if any of you have seen this chap you can't mistake 
his figure, 
his dress is made of stars and stripes,about him there's no 
sham, sir, 
For what he says he's bound to do, and that is Uncle Sam, 
sir.

STOUGHTON BITTERS. 
As Sung by N ED TURNER. 
If you'll just list a 
little while 
A little song I'll sing you; 
And it' it does not make you smile,. 
Why, then, I 
dull must call you. 
It's of Jane Dove—she fell in love, 
And made each heart a 
weeper ; 
IIer affections she bestowed upon 
A heartless young bar-keeper. 
CHORUS. 
With love for her he crazy was, 
Ills heart was torn in tlitters; 
his name I've heard was buzzy bird, 
But they called him Stoughton Bitters. 
Stoughton Bitters he was four foot two, 
And he dressed up in the fashion ; 
And many charms his face peeped through, 
Jane thought he was quite dashing. 
The 
knocking down " he done up brown, 
lie went it steep, or steeper; 
lie had plenty cash to cut a 
dash, 
This gallus young bar-keener. 
With love for her, (Sce. 
Stoughton Bitters, he was wide-awake, 
And talked as sweet as honey ; 
And to Miss Dove he love did make, 
Because she hind much money. 
Her bank account was a 
large amount, 
And he. than Old sick deeper ; 
Says " Very soon I'll have her pile," 
This deceitful young bar-keeper. 
With love for her, &e. 
When Stoughton Bitters got the cash, 
lie for Jersey City started ; 
With a 
waiter gal lie cut a 
dash, 
And left Miss Dove broken-hearted. 
His victim has been put to bed, 
And hasn't since been a 
sleeper; 
To think that she'd been done, ' tis said, 
By this cruel -oung bar-keeper. 
With love for her, tte.

Johnson.— What experiment were you trying ? 
Ned.—I 
was trying to burn a 
hole froo a 
piece ob paper. 
Johnson.—Oh, it is impossible to do so without fire. 
,Ned.—I

Johnson.-11m did you do it? 
/Ved.—Well, you see, you take de signifying glass in your right 
hand, and de piece ob paper in your left hand, and you hold de 
glass up until you commence to draw it down to de paper, and 
den you get a 
focus. 
Johnson.-11a ! ha! 
Focus ! 
You should never use words 
you don't know the meaning of. 
1Ced.—Who don't know de meaning ob— 
Johnson.—You don't. 
Ned.—Yes I

ADVENTURE ON BROADNAY. 
As Sung by NED TURNER. 
As I 
went out the other day, with spirits light and gay 
A lady walked in front of me, agoil.g down Broadway. 
She slipped, and tumbled in the mud, and sprawling, there she lay 
Laughed at by every one. 
While in the mud she was sprawling, 
To me for assistance calling, 
And quickly I 
was pulling, hauling, 
The crowd still jeering on. 
As soon as she recovered, she returned her thanks so free. 
She said, that when she started, she was going out to tea ; 
But now her dress was all besmeared, she'd takea walk with me, 
So we went walking Oil; 
She said that I 
was quite a 
dandy, 
I 
helped her in her dilemma so handy, 
So I 
asked her to take all ttle I 
randy, 
While we went walking on. 
We both went into Tft lor's then, and had a 
glass apiece, 
At the mud upon her dress and hat, the laughter did increase. 
FIer face with perspiration looked as if it were dipped in grease; 
'Twas fun for every one. 
She looked s 
dirty as a 
beggar, 
But soon the liquor made her swagger, 
And she drank so much she began to stagger, 
When we went marching on. 
Now what on earth was I 
to do ? I 
couldn't get away, 
For every glass she swallowed down, she called on ma to pay; 
She asked we then to see her home, a 
little while to stay, 
So we went walking 071 
We started off, by jeers saluted, 
The mob at every step recruited; 
I 
met her husband—and got well booted, 
In the place where I 
set down,

QUESTIONS OPEN FOR ANSWERS. 
How many pockets there are in a 
coat of paint ? 
It a 
laborer who killed time was guilty of murder? 
When a 
person is bound by a 
spell, what kind of a 
cord 
is used ? 
What language the mouth of a 
river speaks ? 
What kind of a 
needle the person used to sow a 
field of 
wheat ? 
If the scales of a 
fish are used to weigh groceries ? 
If the gout ever attacks the leg of a 
table ? 
If the finger of scorn was ever afflicted with a 
felon ? 
If the man who ran against his will hurt himself? 
11 a 
stove ever has corns on its feet ? 
If it is a 
cat-scratch that a 
prize-fighter comes to ? 
If any one was injured by the lady's bursting into tears ? 
If the man who was struck dumb with astonishment 
ever regained his speech ? 
If the apple of the eye has ever been pared ? 
If pigs can be raised in a 
stye on an eye-lid ? 
If a 
person's days are numbered, can he multiply them? 
UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE.— To 
go into a 
book store and not 
ask for " Ned Turners New Songster." 
What is the difference between a 
hnngry man and a 
glutton ? 
One longs to eat, and the other eats too long. 
When must Ned Turner have a 
strange appetite ? 
When 
he Cracks Bones. 
When should a tavern keeper visit an iron foundry? 
When he wants a 
bar-made. 
What is the difference between Noah's ark and Joan of 
Ark? One was made of wood, and the other Maid of 
Orleans. 
Who was the first convict ? 
Adam ; he was condemmed 
to hard labor for life. 
Why is a 
lovely woman like a 
fine cigar ? 
Because both 
suit so well the lips of gentlemen.

BURLESQUE SPEECH. 
As Delivered by NED TURNER. 
WHITE FOLKS AN' ODER TRASH: 
I've left de bosom ob my washerwoman an' de rest ob de family, 
to come here dis ebening for de purpose ob dispellin' de darkness 
ob your ig-aums. 
In de first place, whare's de man dat built de _Allegany Moun-
tains? 
Who seed de last brickbat frowed, and whar is he gwan 
to ? 
Is he not, at dis momentous moment ob periods, seated, like 
de Caterpillars ob de Temple ob Crisis (Isis), in de chronometer 
ob de dark ages ? 
Ask de wild echo, and what will de wild echo 
say ? " Shoo-Fly, don't bodder me." 
Dat's so— and more too. 
When in de course ob human events it becomes necessary fur 
de colored portion ob dis fcplation to look into enquire into— 
into inquire into—into—that's so—and more too. 
To return to 
our subject. 
Now that I 
have the pleasure ob on dressing 
you I 
will stick to de pints and de confluence whereby I 
am 
myself annihiliated. 
Dot's so—and more too. 
In de time ob de Del-looge, wen it rained forty days and 
twenty-seben nights, what did Noalls Ark say to de odor man 
when he proposed buying de Great Eastern, razeein' de main-
brace, taking a 
reef in de quarterstaff, an' turning it into a 
pri_ 
vateer—what did he say ?—umph what did he say ? 
Why, he 
took anoder pull at de whiskey keg—but tuned up his left eye, 
and said," Shoo-Fly—dat's so—an' more too." Againly fellow en-
ebriates, as Julius CLesar said to de man dat struck Billy Patter-
son, " which am de best 4, 11, 44, in de Pokemoke, or 3, 11, 33, 
in de Deleware 
Whar is de barber barbarous enough to shave 
a 
note, to trim de whiskers on de face ob nature, to curl de hair 
on de head ob a 
barrel, to pull a 
toof from de mouth ob a 
river, 
or to cure a 
corn on de foot ob a 
mountain ? 
-Whar is he ? 
Dar 
is no need ob me answering such a 
rediculus question as " you 
know how it is yourself" and more too. 
But at the same time, 
taking all dose tings into consideration which would you rather 
do or go a 
fishing. 
1 
am willin' to admit that Horace Greely 
[
1] 
BURLESQUE SPEECH.—[CONTINUED. 
ain't no more to be compared . to Joan of Arch, than—than in 
spite ob his teeth. 
And if there is anything I 
do despise it is 
one ting more dan anoder. 
But at the same time ax your own 
conscience and de glorious past, which you—you'd rather do— 
or—or—get married. 
What does Byron say? 
Doesn't he say 
dat 
" 
Dere was an old woman and what do you think ? 
She lived upon nothing but Tittles and drink ?" 
which proves exclusively, and disgustinly, dat you can't make 
sandwiches out ob leather brickbats and hash ob cast iron filings. 
Dat's so—and more too. 
Den look what de ' stronomer says. 
Look—look at the double-
eyed chapter, left-hand verse, and secoad-hand page, ob de Comic 
Almanac, dar you'll find it: 
" 
Vittles and drink was de chief ob her diet, 
But dis little old woman would never be quiet." 
Wot's de reason ob dat? urn—eh? ' Kase de ole woman 
was married; she had a 
man to knock around. 
Dat's SO— and 
more too. 
When a 
man gets married, wot does he do? urn— 
eh ?—wot—wen he goes to de halter, does he tink how sad' ii be 
his fate before de bri lals ober ? wet feelin's it's gwan to stir vi 
and leabe de tram on his mind ? 
He don't care a 
bit, '
kase he 
acts on de spur oh de moment; but when de ole woman holds de 
reins ob government, den she is bound to curb him. De woman is 
always de leader. 
Den if she'd be sulky, or de bedstead should 
be buggy, he must only wag on de best way he can, for de gray 
horse is always de best mare. 
Dat's so—and more too. 
Again Brother lunatics, just look at de newspapers now-a-days 
—jest look at 'em—you can't pick up a 
single newspaper big or 
little, de Herald, Tinzes, Tribune, Sun, I 
don't care which one ob 
'em, you can't look at it widout —widout—reading somefin in it. 
Dat's so—and more too.

What was it I 
seed in de Herald dis morning? What was it ? 
Right on de second page too; dar it was, an article headed, (its 
a 
scandalous fact,) " provisions has riz !" 
Now what's de kinse-
quanses inn— eh? Why de kinsequanses am dese, molasses and 
coffes gwan to hab a 
tight—cheese is gwan to be a 
spectator, 
'molasses 'II get licked, coffee will settle down on its own grounds, 
and after de muss de cheese will skip off providing dat it's mighty. 
Dat's so—and more too. 
Conclusively, in de—de— de — de what's-its-name place, who 
says de menagerie is—is—is—ah—" well you know how it is 
yourself." 
Is de man wid de diamond breastpin or de man dat 
elected General Jackson when he rushed up to de barber-pole, or 
de Norf pole, or de 'lection pole, or de forty-foot pole, dey stir 
up de monkeys wid, with his carpet-bag in his mouf, and de tig 
wicket in each hand, and his umbrella in de oder. 
Wot did he 
say? 
he, said—he said—and he was right. 
Dat's so—and 
more too. 
And now, fellow-escaped convicts, to commence at de—de con-
clusiorum, let us sagatiate de question more fullerly. 
Imake de 
motion, before de dissolution ob de constitution ob de meetin', 
dat we 'point myself a 
committee ob seven, to scout around and 
look out for de go:.K1 time coming. 
Now to lay down de pint— 
when its lager-bier, I 
prefer a 
quart—to lay down de pint, what 
am de good time comin' ? 
Whar am it gwan to ? and whar am 
it gwan to stop, when it get here ? 
As de great somebody says 
in de play of somefin, dat's tie, question. 
De good time coming 
am when de gals don't go into conniption-fits ober de latest 
fashions, and substract dere hoops to de atmosphere ob twenty-
seben feet in giameter; when de men don't stand on de corners 
on wet days, to look at de gaiters, de ankles, and de oder fixins; 
when de gals don't take cotton to deir bosoms; when de alder-
men study Webster's Condictionary to find out de meaning ob de 
word " honesty," and de police don't take " bribes ;" 1t hen de 
brokers don't shave a

As subjects now are getting scarce, 
. To sing or write upon, 
And authors are puzzled what to do, 
To cause a

As all of you can see: 
The way that humbug's swallowed now 
Dat gets ahead of me.

All, ha, ha, I

When I

De way dat humbug's swallowed now— 
Dat gets ahead of me. 
Why is it poor folks now-a-days, 
If any deed they've done, 
Are quickly nabbed, sent down below, 
And, two to one, are hung ? 
Why is it, if they've got the cash, 
De jury wont agree, 
But bring a 
murderer in insane ? 
Dat gets ahead of me. 
Ah, ah, ah, I 
can't help, 
Why is it ladies all for show, 
Go deep into husband's books— 
Wear silks and satins loaded down, 
With such tremengeous hoops ? 
How is it dandies cut a

In big society, 
And owe such awful tailor bills ?

TAKE CARE OF NUMBER ONE. 
As Sung by NED TURNER. 
White folks pay attention, 
I've brought my Tambo 'long, 
It came into my head, 
You'd like to hear tt, song. 
Since the strings are in tune, 
And away from home l've come, 
This advice I 
give to you, 
First take care of number one. 
CHORUS. 
Alk 
Hold fa!t your money, boys, 
The thing is easy done, 
Make this your motto, now. 
Take care of Number One. 
Tead the daily papers, 
That's when you want the news, 
Swallow all they tell you, 
Believe it if you choose. 
When you want your name up, 
The way to get it done, 
Just pay the editor, 
He'll 44 puff" you Number One. 
Hold fast, &c. 
There's the " New York Ledger." 
Would give me any price, 
To write them lots of songs, 
Or something else that's nice 
Five thousand dollars cash, 
I'd like to have the sum ; 
Besides helping Mr. Bonner, 
'Twould help along Number One.

NEW YEAR'S CALLS. 
As Sung by "
NED TURNER. 
Oh! listen awhile fair ladies ob New York, 
While I 
tell you what's a 
doin' in de city ; 
On de lust ob de year de gemmun make dere calls, 
As always is custom on New Year's Day. 
Now de germnun try dere best to look very neat, 
Dey get up early in de morning, 
Dey shine dere patent leathers and squeeze em on dere feet, 
Den dey are off long before de day's dawning. 
CHORUS. 
Pull off your coat, roll up your sleeves, 
Jordan am a 
hard road to travel; 
Pull oil your coat, roll up your sleeves, 
Happy New Year in de morning. 
While de ladies am engaged in pouring out de wine, 
in dealin' out de wedding cake and candies ; 
ang-a-ling goes de bell an' in pops a 
crowd, 
Of gemmun, b'hoys and little dandies. 
gemmun look surprised and take a 
back seat, 
Young America salutes all de ladies; 
And while de little b'hoys am eatin' bread an' meat, 
De ole men sit playing wid de babies. 
Pull off your coat, &e. 
So all through the day dey stroll through de streets, 
Wid dere bread baskets full of cake and whisky ; 
Dey hab kissed so many gals dat dere heads begin to swim, 
And dere legs begin to feel kind ob frisky ; 
But de ladies will forgive 'em if dey get a 
little tight, 
Because they know dat they do it widout thinking, 
For kissing pretty gals will far more intoxicate 
Than all the wine and brandy they've been drinking. 
Pull off your coat, SLc.

ANOTHER MERCHANT, &C.— CONCLUDED. 
ANOTHER MERCHANT OF VENICE. 
A TRAVESTIE. 
There lived 
Venice, famed of old for streets laid out in water, 
A cringing, stony-hearted Jew, who had an only daughter. 
Called Shylock was this noted Jew, by reason of his pate— 
For it was bald and shiny as a 
bran-new pewter plate. 
his daughter's name was Jessica ; he loved her passing; well— 
But whether more than " monish," ' tis hard for us to tell. 
Close by, there dwelt Antonio, a 
merchant famed and rich, 
Who trafficked upon the seas in merchandise and " sich;" 
lie had a 
friend, Bassanio, with brains, but " nary red," 
And he was " spocny " on a 
gal, and much inclined to wed. 
Miss Portia the damsel's name, whose dad, her choice to baffle, 
Put up her fortune and her hand in a 
sort of modern raffle. 
To win the prize,Bassanio was bound to risk his all ; 
But when he came to count the cost, his bank account was small. 
Straight to Antonio he goes, t.) raise a 
little " tin:" 
Yet he, though rich, was rather short, for his ships had not got in. 
Quoth the Venetian, " Let us hie straightway unto the Jew— 
Shylo?k will lend upon my bond enough for me and you." 
" 
Three thousand ducats," quoth the Jew, " tish a 
large sum to 
lend; 
You blackguards me sometimes, you know, but now you ish my 
friend ; 
Veil, I 
gets tl'e monish for you, and thus shall yon be bound; 
Of your fair fleit, if you don't pay, you gives me shust one pound. 
So to the notary's forth they go, the Christian and the Jew ; 
They sign the bond, the cash is got to put Bassanio through. 
Straight to Miss Portia's house he goes, in " gorgeous " array, 
Woos the fair maid, selects aright, and bears his bride away. 
The three months passed, the bond came due, but ne'er in all the 
While 
Did unfortunate Antonio succeed in " striking ile;" 
lie did not even see a 
ship, though thcy'd shipped many seas! 
The wind that blew bad luck to him was a 
cutting sort of breeze. 
For judgment now before the Duke the several parties stand— 
Old Shylock with a 
pair of scales, and butcher-knife in hand. 
[1] 
Bassanio with his ducats, though they came a 
day too late; 
And Antonio, the merchant, nerved up to meet his fate. 
The Duke he makes a 
pretty speech, expounding well the law— 
Declares the bond is forfeit, the case without a 
flaw. 
Bassanio makes wry faces, and calls himself a 
lubber; 
Antonio, majestic, bids him stop his deuced blubber, 
The Jew he whets his butcher-knife, to finish up his grudge, 
When enter Mistress Portia, disguised as a 
judge. 
Balthasar, junior, she represents, while, to help along the lark, 
Her waiting-maid, Nerissa, personifies the clerk. 
The learned judge reviews the case, decides the Jew is right, 
But hopes that he'll be merciful, and take the cash at " sight," 
" 
Oh, wise young judge !" old Shylock cries, " a 
second Daniel 
thou— 
Who ever saw such wisdom 'neath such a 
youthful brow ! 
I'll not have the Christian's ducats, from them he shall not part ; 
But as it's your decision, I 
prefer to take his heart." 
" 
Take, then," the youthful judge replies, " take, then, thy cruel 
knife, 
Cut quickly out thy pound of flesh ' and end this cruel strife ; 
But if you shed one drop of blood, of Christian blood, old Jew, 
By all the tribes of Israel, I'll bet we'll put you through. 
No blood is thine, but simply flesh, and only just a 
pound— 
rather think, old skinflint, that Venetian law you've found. 
Now cut away you rascal, and be sure you hit the thing, 
For if you don't I 
promise you your carcass soon shall swing." 
" 
Ish dat de law ? 
If dat ish so, I 
tint: I 
takes de money." 
"Oh I 
no you don't," says Mistress Judge; " you're late for that, 
my honey ! 
And more, for that you undertook to settle the Christian's " hash," 
Besides your life, the law provides that you give up your cash. 
One half shall be Antonio's the merchant whom you hate ; 
The other half Bassanio's, the balance to the State. 
If you conclude to hang yourself, we hope that you'll not falter 
And, as you're poor, the State, I'm sure will furnish you a 
halter. 
Exit the Jew, the curtain falls, the judge resumes her flounces; 
Love smiles on all the rest, of course, as the fifth act announces.

STANDING ON A CORNER. 
As Sung by N ED TURNED.. 
Standing on a 
corner, smoking a 
cigar, 
There I 
saw a 
pretty girl stepping from a 
ear; 
My attention was attracted by a 
dimple in her chin, 
So I 
resolved that I 
would go and try this girl to win. 
I 
followed her right down the street, still keeping back the 
while, 
Admiring of her pretty dress, cut in the latest style ; 
Grecian bends and waterfaHs, both fastened up behind, 
And as I 
followed up the girl, the thought came to my 
mind. 
CHORUS . 
That standing on a 
corner, smoking a 
cigar, 
There I 
saw a 
pretty girl stepping from a 
car ; 
My attention was attracted to a 
dimple in her chin, 
So I 
resolved that I 
would go and try this girl to win. 
She soon came to her house, ' twas Number Twenty-four, 
So I 
walked on quick, to see her face once more; 
As she started up the steps, her handkerchief she dropped ; 
I 
picked it up—politely called upon her to stop; 
I 
gave it her, she thanked me, and asked me to come in ; 
Of course I 
went, and right away love- talking did begin. 
I 
got her promise, then I 
left, but called next day ; 
She asked me where I 
saw her first, what could 1 
do but say— 
Standing on a 
corner, &T . 
I 
married her, now I 
live in Number Twenty-four ; 
I've got the number posted up, in big figures on the door. 
Though I've been singing bout this girl, I 
haven't told her 
name ; 
It's the sweetest name you ever heard, ' tis Lizzie Matilda 
Jane. 
So now, young men, to catch a 
girl you needn't go so far ; 
Just stand upon a 
corner, and watch them in the car : 
I 
did the same, and got a 
girl, the first one that I 
met ; 
Since we've been married, I 
tell her I 
never do regret—

THE DANDY NIG. 
As Sung by NED TURNER. 
I'm a 
dandy fig that looks so gay, I 
always dress so neat, 
Upon a 
summer's afternoon, promenading down the street; 
With cane in hand, boots brushed up bright, my hat thrown on one side, 
A. pretty girl upon my arm, who is going to be my bride, 
For as through the streets we walk, folks about us do talk, 
And wonder wits that couple is takes up the whole sidewalk. 
This gal of mine she dresses fine, and wears the Grecian bend, 
Beforonext Sunday comes around, to marry her I 
intend. 
Her eyes are bright, her teeth so white, and oh, such pretty feet. 
The folks all stop and look at uSas we promenade down the street. 
For as through, &c.

HOW DO YOU LIKE MY FEET? 
As sung by NED TURNER. 
As I 
was walking out one day. 
In this muddy weather, 
I 
saw a 
girl with pretty feet, 
Cased in morocco leather. 
She smiled at me, I 
winked at her, 
And then I 
crossed the street; 
When turning round, she said tome, 
"flow do you like my feet ?" 
CHORUS. 
Says I, " Bless the rain, and bless the slueh, 
That make this muddy weather, 
So I 
can see your pretty feet, 
Cased in morocco leather." 
She wore a 
handsome waterfall, 
And a 
new- fashioned bonnet, 
One of the latest fashion sacks, 
With shoulder straps upon it. 
Her dress she lifted out the mud, 
As she tripped o'er the street; 
I 
really thought that I 
should faint, 
She had such pretty feet. 
Says I, " Bless, &c. 
I 
walked apart and looked around, 
She looked at me and smiled ; 
I 
slackened up my pace a 
bit, 
And spoke to her quite mild. 
We were just by Taylor's big saloon. 
Says she, " Won't you stand treat?" 
I 
could not well refuse her, for 
She had such pretty feet. 
Says I, " Bless, &o. 
We went in there, refreshments had. 
I 
thought that I 
had won her, 
But when we Caine out, says she, " Good-bye," 
And tripped around the corner. 
I 
went right home and went to roost, 
But found I 
could not sleep; 
For right before my eyes I 
thought, 
I 
saw those charming feet. 
Says I, " Bless, 8Le.

HUMBUG IS ALL THE GO. 
As Sung by NED Tiamit. 
I've got a 
song. you'll find it's new, 
It's one to suit the times, sirs ; 
The subject inic4t be known to you, 
Who listen to my rhymes, sirs. 
I 
don't intend to flatter you, 
Your censure I 
defy it : 
You're all a 
set of humbugs, 
And you know you can't deny it. 
CHORus. 
Yes, sir-ee, 
Humbug now is all the go, 
Oh, yes, sir-ee. 
You'll often in the papers see, 
(It's quite the rage of late, sirs ;) 
A tender maiden, young and tree, 
Advertise for a 
mate, sirs. 
A gay old brick an answer sends, 
They soon appoint a 
meeting; 
She bleeds him well, and there it ends, 
By humbug lie is beaten. 
Yes, sir-ee, ttc. 
Now folks should never more grow ill, 
The doctors are so clever; 
They've patent bitters, draughts and pills, 
TO 
make you live forever ; 
They advise you to swallow all their stuff, 
And never mind expense, sir ; 
But don't you be so jolly green, 
They are humbngs—nothing else, sir. 
Yes, sir-ee, &e. 
There's dainty damsels flitting round, 
hi satin, silks and laces ; 
With cotton busts and bustles too, 
And paint upon their faces. 
They hook a 
flat, and are married, 
Then spend their husbands cash, sir; 
He finds that he's been humbugged, 
She has sweetly sucked him in, sir. 
Yes, sir-ee, tte.

NIP CAT ON THE BRIZ. 
As Sung by li-En TURNER. 
Some folks are never easy without they're dressed to kill, 
Others ne'er feel happy until they've drank their fill. 
In gutters low they happy lie, they seem to know the " biz," 
When you try to wake them up, they yell " Oh, nip cat on the

CHORUS. 
In days gone by the by-word was, 
A 
murmuring of " cheese,"— 
But now 'tis true the saying is, 
" 
Oh, nip cat on the briz." 
A new " friend" of mine, the other day, says " Ned, come with 
me, 
I'll show you where some fun is seen, and you will merry be, 
" 
The wickedest man" in all New York would not act so quiz— 
lie wanted me to lay on the " Jack," but oh, " nip cat on the

In days gone by the by-word, dr.c 
A 
lady fair my love did win, and I 
loved her well, 
Her feet were large as door-mats, her name I 
cannot spell; 
I 
climbed the wall one night—I 
thought to see my Liz, 
The watch-dog grabbing rne, seemed to say " Oh, nip cat on the

In days gone by the by-word, was 
A

But now 'tis true the saying is,

As sung by E EL) TURNER. 
Oh, I 
never shall forget the happy day, 
That I 
met my Angelina Minnie May; 
her complexion it was slaty, 
You can bet she was a 
beauty, 
For she stol ,, my heart and gizzard all away. 
This colored maid the darkies did admire, 
When she smiled on me I 
thought I 
would expire; 
But I 
could no longer tarry, 
For she said she wouldn't marry, 
But she stole my heart and gizzard all away.

This colored maid the darkies did admire, 
When she smiled on me I 
thought I 
would expire; 
But I 
could no longer tarry, 
For she said she wouldn't marry, 
But she stole my heart and gizzard all away. 
In the sparkling of the silver shining moon, 
This throbbing- 
heart I 
offer as a 
boon ; 
She began to sigh and mutter, 
And she called me bread and butter, 
I 
was sailing iii Professor Low's balloon, 
You ought to see her promenade the street, 
With her little gaiters on her fairy feet, 
Oh, the way she wears her gipsey, 
It makes this darkey tipsey, 
I 
declare I 
think she's good enough to e;.t. 
This colored maid, &c. 
Now, this colored maid you never see her more, 
She is sleeping on the Coney Island shore: 
Her spirit now is gliding, 
And with the little fishes hiding, 
I'm afraid I'll have to faint upon the floor. 
Now ladies, I 
must bid you all adieu, 
But I 
hope you don't believe my story true; 
So if you will excuse my capers, 
I 
will print it in the papers, 
And I'll have it set to music just for you.

TIME ALONE WILL PROVE.—{CONCLUDED] 
That marriage is a 
lottery 
You'll own beyond a 
doubt; 
And woman is that sort of thing 
No fellow can make out; 
The men who choose a 
wife in haste 
Too often find they're sold; 
But when they get a 
good one, they 
Have found a 
mine of gold. 
Cuo.—Time alone will prove, 
Too often we believe in those 
Who make the finest show, 
And take their glitter all for gold 
Before their worth we know; 
The gilt wears off, we find them out, 
And somehow they suggest 
The olden shows at country fairs, 
The outside is the best. 
CH0.—Time alone will prove, die. 
New schemes are starting every day 
There's something new appears, 
Long legal cases, too, that seem 
As though they'd last for years; 
flow all these things may chance to end, 
The wisest do not know. 
So be content to wait and see 
What time alone can show. 
Cuo.—Time alone will prove, d5c.. 
The Tiehborne case, now going on, 
Creates a 
stir and fuss, 
It bothers all the legal minds 
And sadly puzzles us.

UMBRELLA COURTSHIP. 
As Sung by NED TURNER. 
A belle and a 
beau would walking go, 
In love they both were pining ; 
The wind in gentle gales did blow, 
An April sun was shining. 
Though Simon long had courted Miss, 
lie knew he'd acted wrong in 
Not having dared to steal a 
kiss, 
Which set her quite a-longing. 
Ri tidy fol, &c. 
It so occurred, as they did walk, 
And viewed each dale so flow'ry, 
As Simon by her side did stalk, 
Declared the sky looked show'ry. 
The rain came to her like a 
drug, 
When loudly he did bellow : 
" 
Look here, my love, we can be snug, 
For I've got an umbrella." 
Ri tidy fol, &c. 
Quick flew the shelter over Miss— 
Now Simon was a 
droll one; 
He thought this was the time to kiss, 
And from her lips he stole one. 
She blushed ; the rain left oil, and he 
The umbrella closed for draining; 
" 
Oh ! don't," says she, " I 
plainly see 
It hasn't left oil raining." 
Ri tidy tol, &c. 
Now Simon, when he smok'd the plan, 
The umbrella righted ; 
He grew quite bold, talked like a 
man, 
And she seemed quite delighted. 
Their lips i:ang chimes full fifty times, 
Like simple lovers training; 
Says she : " These are but lovers' crimes; 
I 
hope it won't leave oft raining."

WIDDERS BEW A R E . 
As Sung by :N.
TED TURNER. 
Young Daniel was tall, 
But mighty short of cash ; 
A—down his upper lip there hung 
A delicate moustache, 
A ladies man. indeed was he, 
So handsome and s3 smart ; 
But Dan-i-el, this nice young man, 
Was very false at heart. 
CIIORUS. 
Then Widders all beware, 
Of man, false-hearted man; 
And maidens, do take care, 
To shun hint if you can. 
A Whirler first he met, 
W 1109'3 weeds, indeed were few, 
.And this poor Widder really thought, 
That Dan-i-el was true, 
But oh, alas! this Widder she, 
Who hoped to be hits bride, 
Discovered soon that he was false, 
Took " pisou," and she died. 
Then Widders all, & c. 
A maid he courted next, 
About a 
year or so, 
And she was, too, as fine a 
gal, 
As ever had a 
beau-
But this poor maiden she found out, 
As many lovers do, 
That he was false to her, 
Although her heart was true. 
Then Widders all, &c. 
"How could yon treat me so, 
Oh, Dan-i-el ?" she cried; 
She fell and fainted in his arms, 
And finally she died ! 
Her fate was very hard, indeed, 
And sad as it was true; 
Believe if you will or not. 
Her heart was uroken in two. 
Then Widders all, &C. 
A Whirler gone to rest, 
A foolish in aiden too, 
Who " Kicked the bucket" just because, 
Her lover was not true. 
Then ladies never let your hearts— 
In early years or late— 
Incline to man, deceitful man, 
He'll break it, " sure as fate." 
Then Widders all, &c. 
THE LIME KILN MAN.

Oh, ladies fair, now have a

And watch my little jig, 
Remember what I

Throw glances sweet at MC. 
Their hearts I 
know go pit a

They wish that they had me. 
lly name is heard go where you will, 
For when I'm on the stage, 
Bright faces greet me lovingly, 
And say, " he's all the rage." 
Then listen, & c. 
From dome to pit they all admit, 
I'm " lovely as a- rose "— 
The yaller gals they Nvinkat me, 
As everybody knows.

For 1 . ve ignores the law. 
And make in

By giving an encore.

LET HER RIP. 
Burlesque Speech as delivered by NED TURNER. 
FELLI:IZ CITIZENS :
—
COreSp0/1dill' to your unanimous 
call Use here dis eUenin.' When I 
say dis ebenin; I 
say soe 
lase I 
is here. 
I 
aint a 
gwan stuflen' you up, lase as de 
feller said when de boardin' woman ob de eleben-shilling-
a-week hotel brought in de twenty-five- year-old turkey-
gobbler stuffed wid dried peas and stewed cranberries, I 
'fors stunt. 
Den, my fellow inebriates, de conclusion is 
odious. 
Don't de 
th act ot Congress-water declar dat

and derided, dat I 
must say somefin.' 
Now what's I 
gwine 
to say? I 
tole you. 
l'se gwine to go ahead, and let her 
rip.

Derefore, my hearers and fellow-humans, luff 
us put on de spectaeles oh geography, and look back to de 
period ob times gone by, when dere libed a man by 
de name ob Smith. I 
onced knowed a man by de name 
ob Smith, he was a 
respectable man, ob rich but honest 
parents. but I 
despise dat man ' kase his name was Smith. 
'Kase why? ' Kase ' in de days tint tried men's soles" 
and heels ( 1 
at was de weather), de Smith ob tryanny tried 
to forgo de chains ob oppression to bind do sons ob Uncle 
Sam. 
But what did Uncle Sam do ? mu ? dats de question. 
Why, he got anoder Smith to break de chains. 
And what 
was de mune oh dat Smith, um ? 
General George Wash-
ington dat was his name. And whar was de forge ? Why, 
it was Valley Forge. 
Dats whar he knelt in de snow and 
prayed to de Lord to help de cause oh Liberty, and let her

let ebery loyal and patriotic, yes, patriotic loyal mother 
son of us stand ready wid hands on his arms, yes, arms in 
his hands in magnanimous defense of our— of our— of our,

And I 
say, here, standing upon dis piney 
platform of—of—this stage, if there is any fightin' to be 
done, then in de language oh de gifted—yes, de highly 
gifted and unterrified Scottish chief: 
Come one come all! this rock shall fly, 
From its firm base—in a 
pig's eye. 
Whot am England anyhow ? Look on de map in Web-
ster's Contradictionary, dar you'll see a big black spot 
'bout as big as de last chaw in a 
five-cent paper ob tobac-
co, or de kidney ob a 
consumptive chicken, dats England. 
Why, my fellow bums. I've seen colored men wid molds 
big enough, if dey wasn't to lazy to open 'em—big enough 
to swallow it. 
Den look on de map and see what America 
am. Why my friends, it looks as if a 
runaway boss-an-
waggon had started off to mark it out, and hadn't got 
cotehed for a 
week. 
Pears to me dat when nature made 
up her mind to make America, she resoived to go it on a 
big scale, and so she let her rip. 
didn't England try to claw us at New Orleans, 
and didn't dey get chawed up in de transaction ? 
Didn't 
we go froo ' em like Brandreth's pills? 
Didn't dey run 
from de cotton bales den ? 
But what's we gwine to do if 
they show fight and welick 'em again, um ? dats de way to

Why scolonise it, and send all de contrabands dere,

will be brudder Horace Greeley ; suck-am-tory ob State, 
Charles Sumner ; suck-am-tory oh War, Lucy Stone-jug ; 
and Treasurer, myself ! 
Den what will we do ? 
Why, 
we'll pull off de winkers, loose de reins, and let her rip.

When de whole United States flag won't be big

What is the difference between a 
girl and a

One is barn to wed, the other is W0111 to bed.

CREAM COLORED QUEEN. 
As 
sung by NED TURNER. 
She was sweet'rn sugar cane, 
That cream colored queen, 
She was the gayest creature 
That ever yet was seen. 
She had a 
roguish eye, 
And her features were fair, 
Her lips were like red roses, 
And coal-black was her hair, 
They all did say she was so very gay. 
CHORUS . 
There were many lovely beauties, 
That made the people stare, 
But the prettiest one among them all 
Was the girl with the coal-black hair. 
It was on one moonlight night, 
We went to a 
ball, 
She wore her richest dresses, 
And her largest waterfall. 
She showed her pretty foot, 
In such coquettish style, 
And won the hearts of everyone, 
With her bewitching smile. 
There were many, 8te. 
When the ball was over, 
In a 
buggy we did hop, 
And as I 
drove the horse along, 
The question I 
did pop. 
Says she, " Go ' way. you nigger, 
how dare you ax me dat, 
When I'se a 
female suffrage, 
'Mancipation 'ristocrat."

MAGGIE ANN. 
As Sung by N ED TURNER. 
I 
went to court a 
nice young gal—I 
tell you if I 
can 
I'll tell you all about this gal, my lovely Maggie Ana; 
She was as han'some a 
young gal as ever you did see; 
She used to tell the gals and boys she loved no one like me. 
I 
use 1 
to take my Maggie Ann to every ball and ront; 
I 
used to spend my little change in taking her about ; 
She was very fond of oysters, and would eat till she was blue; 
She said, " It's not the fish I 
like, my dear; it's only you." 
Now, Maggie Arm went out one night to see her cousin McCarty, 
So I 
thought I'd have a 
little spree, so I 
went to a 
party ; 
There was Maggie Ann on a 
young man's knee, when I 
asked her 
what he said; 
When she saw me, I 
tell you, now, it almost killed her dead. 
Oh, I 
went home, now, r • th-r soon—such a 
sight never was seen 
Maggie's arms were round the neck of a 
big hossmarine; 
Stan' back, cullud man, thar's going to b, a 
tight : 
She said, •` Sit down, you foolish man, it's my cousin, Corporal 
White."

Well, it depends upon the nature of the com-

Ned.—Yes; but de young lady would recover immediately. 
BR ANDRETFI PILLS. 
.Ned.—Johnson, you ought to see how I 
was fooled de

Johnson.—How were you fooled ?

JoAnson.— They don't make a 
practice of selling matches

But when I

I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I DID. 
As 
Sung by NED TURNER. 
Pm fond of promenading 
Around with pretty girls ; 
The one that I 
do like the best 
Is her that wears long curls. 
I 
went to see her one fine day, 
Dressed up like a 
kid, 
And when she blushed and winked at me, 
I'll tell you what I 
did. 
CHORUS. 
I 
put my arm around her waist, 
And told her to sit down ; 
Perhaps you'd like to know her name— 
'Twas Clementina Brown. 
The interview I 
had that day 
Set my bosom all aflame, 
So I 
resolved to try once More, 
So in I 
went again. 
As we sat there, the door-bell rung, 
So 'hind the door I 
hid ; 
A 
tall man came in, he stopped all day ; 
But I 
tell you what I 
did. 
I 
left the house that very night, 
No more to live in town ; 
But she explained it all next day ; 
'Twas Cousin Johnny Brown. 
So I 
returned, we married were; 
We're happy as can be, 
The folks call us two turtle-doves, 
My Clementine and me. 
She often talks about that night 
When ' hind the door I 
hid ; 
But then I 
gently hush her up, 
And tell her what I 
did. 
I 
put my arm around, ite.

FATHER, COME HOME, 
A 8 
SUDg by NED TURNER. 
Father, dear father, come home with me now, 
Pat Malloy's gone to Lannigan's ball ; 
Captain Jinks, of the horse marines, is blind drunk, 
And fell in the raging canawl. 
The gal with the waterfall I 
have just left 
A-dancing at Donnybrook fair ; 
She had a 
pair of black eyes that she got in a 
row 
With Norah, the pride of Kildare. 
CHORUS. 
Come home! come home! come home! bad luck, 
Father, dear father, come home. 
Father, dear father, come home with me now, 
And lend me a 
dollar or two ; 
Dick Darlin, the cobbler, he gave me the sack, 
'Cause I 
married the dark gal in blue. 
The charming young widow I 
met in the train— 
Her name I 
can't think of just now— 
Is -a 
sister to the fair one I 
met in the rain, 
Says the pretty maid milking her cow. 
Come home &c. 
Come home! come home! come home! bad luck, 
Father, dear father, come home.

HOLD YOUR HORSES. 
As sung by Nn TURNER. 
Now hold your horses, will you, 
And do not drive so fast, 
And pray do not imagine, 
Your team can't be surpassed. 
One day white I 
was riding, 
With two ladies by my side, 
I 
hardly knew which one to choose, 
To make my happy bride, 
They said they loved me dearly, 
And both wished me to wed ; 
telt so good beside them . both, 
Now what do you think I 
said ? 
Spoken.—JoHNsox—Well, what did you say ? 
NED—Wby I 
said, We gee, we; what ails the animile, go

CHORUS. 
Now hold your horses, will you? 
And do not drive so fast, 
And pray do not imagine, 
Your team can't be surpassed. 
Crack, crack, goes the whip, 
Your horses, let 'em went, 
We'll turn them in when we come back, 
And all our money spent. 
I 
took them to a 
hotel on the road, 
To get some ginger beer, 
They flirted up and down the room, 
To white folks all looked queer. 
One swallowed six milk punches, 
Half a 
dozen eggs as well, 
But when de rhino was to pay. 
darkie had to shell, 
The other gal eat six mince pies, 
Eight juleps quickly sped; 
They axed me then to pay the bill, 
Now what do you think I 
said 
Spoken—JOHNSON— Well, what did you say ? 
NED—Ob course, I 
said— 
Hold you horses, & e. 
One day we went to Harlem, 
To get some lager beer; 
Nine quarts apiece they both did drink, 
And acted very queer. 
My love she ate four pounds of cheese, 
Drank half a 
pint of gin, 
Her foot caught on a 
pretzel, 
Anil she tumbled on her chin. 
And then they called out for police, 
He knocked me on the head, 
The ladies said I 
stole their purse, 
Then what do you think I 
said?"

A LOVER'S DISAPPOINTMENT., 
I 
loved her with affection, 
And kissed her every day ; 
She wanted my protection 
In a 
matrhnonial way. 
I 
often have caress'd her— 
She did to me the same, 
When to my heart I've pressed her, 
I 
felt a 
virtuous flame. 
I 
told my love one morning, 
And spoke of wedlock's joy; 
She, affectation scorning, 
Sung out, " I'm yours, old boy." 
My hand then fell upon her bust, 
And rage did animate her; 
She said, " You'll leave alone, I 
My patent palpitator."

I 
hit him in the face, and then I 
said; 
Now you'll remember me :" 
They took me up for 'sault and battery, 
And took me down for trial ; 
The case was proved—I 
found it useless 
To give in a

And he burst out and sang—

THE FIVE SENSES. 
Johnson.—Bones and Tambo, I 
have a 
question for both 
of you : 
Which of the five senses is most beneficial to 
mail? 
Ned.—Whieli of the five senses ? 
If it's eating, put me 
down for three chances. 
Johnson.—No ; 
you do not understand me. 
Ned.— Well, if it's drinking, putnne down for thirty days. 
Johnson.—No, Ned ; I mean the senses of hearing, 
seeing, feeling, smelling, etc. 
Ned.—Oh, dat's what you want to know 
Johnson.—Yes. 
Xed.—Well, dat is what I 
want to know. 
Johnson.—Do you give it up ? 
Xed.—Yes. 
Johnson.—Well Tambo, what do you think about it ? 
lambo.—About what ?" 
Johnson.—The question, which of the five senses is most 
beneficial to mankind ? 
Tambo.—I tink de five cents we used to hab previous to 
de currency being Ckase-d around de country. 
Jolinson.—I mean the senses of hearing, seeing, etc. 
Tantho.-011, now I 
understand you. I 
tink seeing is de 
best. 
.Yed.—So it is for a 
blind man. 
Johnson.—Ned, do you differ with Tambo ? 
.Ared.—Yes, I 
differ with him muddy. I 
tink hearing 
beats seeing—ill fact, I

Johnson.—Well, I 
shall act as judge, and hear both argu-
ments, commencing with you, Tambo.

vill explain thusly: 
For instance, I was 
playing a 
game ob drawpoker with a 
man ; I 
should take 
up my cards, and see dat I 
had de best hand , I 
should 
den bet five dollars on, it, and my antagonist should raise 
me a 
hundred dollars, and I 
would see him—wouldn't I 
win de money ? 
Johnson.—Why, certainly, if you had the best hand. 
[1] 
1.3t. 
THE FIVE SEN SES.—[CONCLUDED. 
Tambo.—Well, dere is where seeing is de best. 
Johnson. 
Well, Ned that is pretty sound logic. 
Ned.—Yes, but I 
can shatter dat logic in asecond, merely 
by supposing dat he has not got de best hand, de minute 
dat his antagonist raises him, and Tambo sees him, den call 
him, den he hears what he has got. 
Den he is gone, he is 
overboard. 
Johnson.—Tambo, Ned has got a 
little lime best of you. 
Tambo.—Y 
es, but I 
hab not sunk through de floor yet, 
hab I? I 
still stick to seeing. 
Seeist thou de obscure 
corner in de dim distance ? do you observe de little mos-
quito as Ime walks gracefully along de wall ? 
Johnson.—No, sir; I 
see the corner of the wall, but I 
don't see any mosquito. 
7 
anibo.--Yott don't well, I 
do. 
Dere is where seeing is 
de best. 
Johnson.—Ned, Tambo has got a 
little de best of you 
this time. 
Ked.—Wherefore has he 
Johnson.—Why, you do 
the mosquito ? 
Ned.—No, I 
don't ; but

got de best ob me? 
not mean to say that you see 
I hear him walking along (.

ON A 
PINCH-
Johnson.—Ned, did you hear that Sam Brown was 
married ? 
_Ned.—Yes : 
I 
was at de wedding. 
Johnson.— Who was the happy bride? 
.Ned.—lier front name was Arminta, and her back name 
was Snuff. 
Job-Isom—What a 
name ! Snuff ! 
How in the name of 
common sense, did he come to select a 
wife from a 
family 
of that name ? 
Ned.— Why, you see, he took her on a 
pinch.

SO 
THAT LITTLE GIRL WIT.H A HOOD ON. 
As Sung by NED TURNER. 
Oh, I 
once used to court a 
nice young gal, 
And Fll tell you now if I 
can : 
She was a 
big rich farmer's daughter, 
And her name it was Mary Ann. 
Oh, I 
treated her to oysters, cabbage, 
Also vinegar, cheese, and blanc mange; 
She says to me. now you're my darling, 
This little gal with the hood on. 
Oh, I 
took her to supper one evening, 
And I 
placed her right in a 
big chair, 
When her cousin, a 
Frenchman from Limerick. 
Says, Mary, what are you doing there ? 
Says she to him, " This is my sweetheart ;" 
Says be to her, " What! that sardine?" 
I 
split him right straight in de " bugle," 
And skinned just like a 
maker-eel. 
One day, now, she was a 
feeding 
The ducks. and the geese, and the deers, 
This Frenchman from Limerick came pouring 
Flat- iron tales in her ears. 
Oh, I 
rushed td the house, and I 
seized on 
A great big Dutch butcher's cheese-knife. 
I 
grabbed him right straight by the wizzen 
And put an existence right to his life.
