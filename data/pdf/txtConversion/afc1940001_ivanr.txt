Ivan Rue
Collection
Selected and converted. American Memory, Library of Congress.
IVAN RUE I am the gayest beauty that Brooklyn ever knew,With[-?]shining eyes and curling hair, you
love [so?] much to see,And there's no-one-half so handsome excepting Ivan Rue,He's the gayest little
fellow and he's got the [money?] too.He takes[-me?] out a riding, whenever he comes down,He's got
the nicest [carriage?] and the fastest horse in town,And he tells me that he loves me, and I listen,
wouldn't you,He's the gayest little fellow and he's got the [money?] too.- - - - - - -
