About Kristin Parra… 
 
Kristin Byrd Parra was born in 1975 in Hugo, Oklahoma to Geary and Barbara Byrd. She is 
the fourth generation of the Miller line to be involved with the Carson and Barnes Circus. 
Her grandparents were D.R. and Isla Miller. As with most children of circus parents, 
Kristin’s first memories of the circus center around riding an elephant in the parade and 
performing the swinging ladder. She preferred not to be too far off the ground and found her 
niche working with the animals.  
 
Kristin completed all twelve years in the Hugo school system and after graduating from 
Hugo High School, went on to earn a bachelor’s degree from Texas Christian University 
with a major in Spanish and a minor in business. She now manages the animal permits, deals 
with the various inspections related to animals, works with the sponsoring circus hosts as 
well as different accounting aspects of Carson and Barnes Circus. Kristin, her husband, and 
their children enjoy circus life and calling Hugo, Oklahoma home.

My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn and also with me today is Tanya 
Finchum. We’re with the Oklahoma State University Library Oklahoma 
Oral History Research Program, and today we’re interviewing Kristin 
Parra as part of our circus oral history project with a focus on circus 
occupations here in Hugo, Oklahoma. It’s Saturday, November 19, 
2011. Thank you for joining us today. 
 
No problem. 
 
Let’s begin by learning a little more about you. Can you tell us the year 
you were born and where you were born? 
 
I was born right here in Hugo, Oklahoma, in 1975. 
 
Okay, and could you talk a little bit about growing up? 
 
Well, growing up, for me, was very different than most of my friends, 
because I grew up on the circus. We were raised on the circus. We 
traveled with it from when we were first born so that was very unique 
and fun. We got to see lots of places and meet different people. It was 
just a really unique way to grow up. 
 
Can you recall your earliest circus memory? 
 
I remember from a very young age, riding an elephant in the parade. 
When we were younger, we started off with, like swinging ladder was 
our act that we did as young children. Those were all early memories. I 
was probably about six or seven when that took place. 
 
And as you’re growing up you start with swinging ladder. What were 
some of the other acts that you started gravitating towards?

I didn’t like to do heights so I kind of stayed on the ground, and I 
worked with the animals. I rode horses and elephants, and then I learned 
to juggle. I wasn’t very good, but they let me do it anyway. (Laughter) 
 
So what was it like growing up on the lot as a child? 
 
It was like a big playground, actually. There’s always kids to play with. 
There’s always new things to see. You can’t get into much trouble 
because there’s always a hundred people watching you and looking out 
for you, too, so that’s always a good thing. Just a lot of fun. I remember 
it being a lot of fun, actually.  
 
And would you return back to Hugo to go to school? 
 
Yes. We stayed out on the circus until I was in sixth grade, and then my 
sister and I would come home and live with my grandparents. And we 
went to school then, from seventh grade on through the high school, the 
whole year here in Hugo. 
 
And was the Hugo community welcoming towards circus people? 
 
The Hugo community has always been very open-arms, very welcoming 
to us, has always been very good with us. The school part of it also, they 
let us take our books with us, and we would get to work out of them 
during the year, and then we would come back and not have a problem 
and be able to go back into school. So Hugo’s always been real 
wonderful to us.  
 
And growing up, did you spend much time with your grandparents? 
 
I did. We were very fortunate that we got to live with them here in the 
house, growing up. And then when we got older they stayed home with 
us, and my parents went out on the circus. They stayed home with us 
and let us go to school all year long. So we were very fortunate that we 
got to live in the house with them and be around them as much as we 
did. 
 
Did you get to design or create some of your own costumes? 
 
No, I was never in the wardrobe department. I don’t know how. Both my 
granny and my mother, both, were excellent seamstresses and I just 
never got the niche of it. I don’t know. I never was taught that aspect of 
it. 
 
Well, as you were growing up, is there an aspect of the business that you

were gravitating towards more than others? 
 
I wasn’t really a performer at heart. We performed growing up, as I said 
earlier, but I’ve gravitated towards the animal part of it, and then I work 
in the office is where I have found my place in the circus business. 
 
When you say, “Work with the animals,” what does that entail? 
 
I’m in charge of getting all the animal permits and making sure the 
paperwork is up to date on all of them, which is a full-time job. Also, I 
do, like if there’s a vet that needs to come out, I’ll walk around with the 
vet and do the inspections. Or if there’s a USDA [United States 
Department of Agriculture] or local humane society, I’ll do the 
inspections with those as well. 
 
So you travel with the show? 
 
Yes. Yes. 
 
And then in the off-season, where do you spend your time in the 
business? 
 
There is so much paperwork that has to be done. I don’t think anybody 
can really, truly imagine how much paperwork has to be done in the 
wintertime. That’s where I kind of fall in, the boring side of circus 
business, but yet a very important part of it. 
 
So during the winter months you might work eight to two or is it an 
eight-hour-a-day…? 
 
We get there somewhere around between eight and nine, and we’re 
generally there until about five. 
 
Much shorter days than when you’re out on the road. 
 
It’s probably about the same hours, they’re just split up different. On the 
road, I have to be in the office from nine to twelve, but then I’m off from 
twelve to three, and then I have to go back in at three, like three to five. 
And then I’ll go back at six to whenever we finish. So it’s basically the 
same hours, you’re just split up different, and the scheduling is different. 
 
When you’re out on the road, can you take me through a typical day? 
 
Sure. I’m one of the last ones to get up. I’m not a morning person so I 
like to leave towards the end of the caravan, there. I’ll typically get up 
around six-thirty, drive my truck and trailer over the road. We average

about sixty miles a day, set up, get the kids fed and dressed and ready for 
the day, and then I’ll go to the office and meet with the host, who is 
sponsoring the circus. It might be a lion’s club or a Kiwanis club or 
whoever that might be. And I’ll meet with them and we’ll settle up on 
their ticket sales, and then I’ll do some office work until around noon. 
Generally, my husband’s finished at that time so we’ll get the kids 
together and go eat lunch or something. And then the kids normally have 
to start school so we get them in school. We have a little downtime then. 
And then around three or three-thirty I’m back in the office, and that’s 
when we’re selling tickets, and I’m settling up the ticket sellers and 
making sure everybody’s accounted for. We get a dinner break around 
five and back in around six or six-thirty to do it again for the second 
show. Then we’ll settle everything up and make sure our accounting all 
balances and call it a night. I finish around nine o’clock—eight-thirty, 
nine, somewhere around there. 
 
Do you eat in the cookhouse or do you cook your own meals? 
 
I’m not a cook so we eat a lot in the cookhouse. Sometimes we’ll go out, 
off the lot, at lunch just because we have a little more time there and 
then eat at the cookhouse at the night meal. It makes it sound like we’re 
constantly doing something all the time, but if we do have some 
downtime in between twelve or three, if there’s something neat in the 
town, a museum or something fun for the kids to do, then we’ll load 
them up and go and try and do that. They get to see where they’re going 
and where they’ve been so it’s a neat experience for them, also. 
 
Well, do you have a favorite city, a favorite venue you like to go to? 
 
When I was younger one of my all-time favorite cities to play was 
Sheboygan, Wisconsin, but we haven’t played there recently. We used to 
play it right by the beach, and the tent would be set up right there by the 
water. I don’t know, I always loved Sheboygan so that would probably 
be one of my favorites. 
 
Least favorites? (Laughs) Probably shouldn’t say. 
 
Least favorite… really, it depends. If you have bad weather or if the lot’s 
under mud that kind of plays into what would be a least favorite. But as 
far as just a city I don’t want to go to, I don’t have that. 
 
So for us towners, what are some circus terms we may not be familiar 
with? 
 
Circus terms?

Parra 
 
Nykolaiszyn 
Yes. 
 
We have donnikers, that’s our restrooms. The garbage stand is what we 
call the novelty stand, where we set our novelties. You guys are familiar 
with cookhouse, I see. We also have the pie car, where you can go and 
buy a soda pop or cheeseburger if you don’t like what they’re serving in 
cookhouse. Let’s see. The white elephant is the pumper truck that comes 
out and pumps our restrooms. We call it the white elephant. So there’s 
some different terms that we still use. Unfortunately, most of the circus 
lingo has been kind of lost a little bit over the generations so that’s kind 
of a sad aspect of it. 
 
Do you get to go into the stands and watch the show? 
 
I try to see a little bit of it. I don’t watch as much as my sister can, or my 
mom, because I’m in the office more. But I try to watch a little bit of it 
every once in a while, just to remind me why I’m doing it and what 
we’re out there for. 
 
Do your children watch it? 
 
They watch it every once in a while. They’ll sit through it a couple times 
and then not watch it for several days and then come back in and watch 
it a little later. 
 
When you do watch, do you have a favorite part? 
 
I’ve always loved the elephants. They’ve always been my favorite. And 
the flying trapeze, I’ve always liked that. I’m not real fond of cat acts, 
but we don’t have a cat act this year so I don’t have to watch that one. 
 
Did you ever dream of being the ringmaster or something like that when 
you were a child? 
 
Not really. Like I said, I performed but I didn’t have a really strong 
desire to be in there all the time. It just wasn’t my personality. 
 
You went to college? 
 
I did. 
 
Where’d you go? 
 
I went to Texas Christian University at Fort Worth. 
 
Okay. Did you want to continue in the circus business [when you got

older] or did you want to try another area? 
 
I always knew that I wanted to continue the circus. My parents were 
very good. They never forced us to be in it. They said, “You can go do 
whatever you want to do. Go to college and get a doctor’s degree if you 
want to be a doctor.” But I always wanted to come back and be a part of 
the circus. That was never a question. 
 
What is your degree in? 
 
My degree is actually in Spanish, with a minor in business. 
 
Fits this pretty well, then, doesn’t it? 
 
Did you learn Spanish as a youth, growing up? 
 
I think I learned it probably very badly, broken Spanish here and there. 
(Laughs) And then it was my major in college, and then also my 
husband’s from Mexico so that helped also in developing my Spanish 
skills, which still aren’t very—I can get the point across, but it’s not 
perfect Spanish, by any means. (Laughs) 
 
But probably pretty handy in communicating? 
 
Yes, we can have a conversation. It’s not going to be textbook Spanish. 
 
What do you like most about your work in the circus? 
 
My work in the circus or actually being a part of the circus? 
 
Both. 
 
My work in the circus, I love being with the animals, being a part of 
that. I have a strong passion for the elephants, and I love that part of it. 
Being in the circus, I love the fact that my family is together, that we’re 
traveling and my kids are getting to see different parts of the country, 
and we got to see all the parts of the country. I can say I’ve seen every 
national park from the east to the west and everything in between. And it 
is a learning experience. I mean, you learn to appreciate that stuff more 
than just learning about it in a book. You get to see the Grand Canyon 
and you’re like taken back by it. So I like that part of it.

Yes. 
 
Probably the traveling, just being able to see new places and not 
knowing what’s in store for you that day, what that town’s going to be 
like, if the people are going to come out all excited and watch the tent go 
up. That unknown aspect of it, too, is a draw. 
 
A favorite memory of your grandmother and grandfather? 
 
Well, one of my favorite memories with my grandfather, he put me on 
his lap. I was only about seven or eight years old, and he let me steer the 
car, coming onto the lot. He laid down on the seat, and so I got to be a 
big shot and thought I was driving the car. I pulled up and I was excited 
by that. And favorite memories with my granny, I don’t know. It’s a 
hard one to call. She was just a sweet, very unique lady, who we just 
loved to be around. She was quiet, but funny. I don’t know. I’ll have to 
think of that one.  
 
Did she cook for you? 
 
She was a very good cook. Her and my mom, and that’s another talent I 
didn’t get from them. So I don’t know what happened there. (Laughs) I 
don’t cook and I don’t sew, so anyway. But she was a very good cook. 
 
Well, you’ve seen many different parts of the country, yet you call Hugo 
home. Why is that? 
 
Well, that’s where my family has always been. We love Hugo. It’s the 
right size of town for us. We don’t have the hustle and the bustle of the 
big cities, and I feel like the community is very open to the circus and to 
the circus people. I graduated from high school here, and my kids go to 
school here, and we just love Hugo. 
 
The circus life all the way around. 
 
That’s it. 
 
Well, where do you see the future of the circus going? 
 
Well, that’s a hard question. We’d like to see it continue for generations 
to come. It is getting harder to play circus. There’s more regulations and 
more red tape out there, but I still think the general public has a strong 
desire for circuses. I think it still has a great purpose in communities all 
across the United States. 
 
Mostly smaller towns?

Mostly smaller towns. We like to be the main event when we come into 
town. We don’t like a lot of competition you get in bigger cities. We like 
to pull into an empty field and let the magic of the circus evolve and a 
couple hours later, we’re ready to perform. Then we leave as we came, 
and that kind of leaves the awe of the circus in the people’s minds so 
that’s always the unique part of it and the fun part of it. 
 
Just magical. 
 
Well, is there anything else you’d like to add before we close out for the 
day? Anything else you’d like to tell or share? 
 
I can’t think of anything. 
 
Okay. Well, thank you so much for your time. 
 
Thank you.
