NH 
It is the 28th of September 2015, I am in Nogales, AZ. I am talking with 
Veronica Kraushaar of Viva International Partners. Veronica has agreed to talk to 
me a little bit today about her role with working with the produce industry, and 
with marketing. So if you wouldn’t mind telling me a little bit about your backstory 
of how you came to Nogales. You said you’re from Brazil originally… 
 
VK 
Yes.  
 
NH 
So would you mind telling me a little bit about how you arrived here in 
Nogales?  
 
VK 
A long way. I came to Nogales in 1995. I have been working for a large 
marketing agency, or ad agency, in San Francisco. I was in San Francisco at the time. 
I had immigrated to San Francisco in the late ‘70s, and I found myself working on 
the California Avocado Commission account, which is a huge, at that time, was a 
huge, federally-funded growers’ group, and we did a lot of marketing, and that led to 
other produce accounts, which finally led me to the Nogales, and the Fresh Produce 
Association in ’95. I came down here and fell in love with the area, and essentially 
set myself up as the premiere marketing expert agency in the business. There was 
nobody else doing it at the time.  
 
NH 
Nobody at all? 
 
VK 
Nobody else. [slight pause] In town. Yeah. So what I did, you know, in 
marketing, of course, positioning is everything, so what I try to do is position myself 
as being the expert in the marketplace. And my goal, and still is today, my goal with

my agency, was to get the products into the marketplace. [slight pause] Was to work 
with retail chains, was to work with the receivers outside Nogales, to be able to 
create a liaison between what was going on here, from the receiving to the shipment 
to the cross shipment, and then into the marketplace.  
 
[2:04] 
 
[slight pause] 
 
NH 
So what was it about, you said you were working with the Avocado 
Commission in California, what was it about it that was, you said that it sort of led 
into here, what was it about working with the avocado that sort of, was there 
something about produce that got you interested in doing more with it? 
 
VK 
Yes, absolutely. The California Avocado Commission was a key account that 
led me to other produce. I found I had a love for it, coming from Brazil, I knew a lot 
of these items that people didn’t know here. That was kind of exciting. I found that I 
had just a love for working with growers, that going down and visiting the growers 
and plantations, is just really exciting. Being able to bring people down and to 
show…it was just something I was very proud of. And then slowly but surely, much 
more involved in Mexico. You know, finding out that there was so much discrepancy 
between what the market thought of Mexico and what was the reality. And I think as 
a woman, especially, concerned about, you know, these humane things. I was very 
aware of that. And also, in terms of the whole nutrition thing with produce. That was 
an angle that I brought to the party, I think , that was not happening. I ended up 
working with a lot of what we call consumer affairs people in the chains, who are 
really about communicating to the consumer, you know, about wellness and 
nutrition, and that kind of thing. [slight pause] So… 
 
NH 
Sorry, go ahead, do what you need to do there… 
 
[slight pause] 
 
VK 
So yeah, it was a love that I had. I wanted to stay in marketing, I wanted to 
stay…I had a lot of formal marketing expertise. I went to Cornell, by the way. So I 
learned at Cornell how the whole channel works. I have a degree in, basically in food 
management, which is, you know, kind of a catch-all. But it really provides a good 
overview of how the food channel works. So I was able to take that and slowly but 
sure, I ended up just kind of settling down here in Nogales, and getting in with the 
FPAA, or the Fresh Produce Association, as their marketing person. A few years into 
the program, what happened, and this is what’s interesting about the produce 
business, is that as these warehouses and these member companies of the FPAA 
groom larger, the Giumarras, Del Campo’s, the big guys. They wanted to do their 
own marketing. They didn’t want to, basically, have someone from the association 
running their marketing. So they all essentially hired marketing people in house, or

they brought somebody like me along, who was an outsider, but could be their 
marketing department.  
 
[5:10] 
 
NH 
So did you, when you moved here, were you working independently, or were 
you working with the FPAA? I was just trying to... 
 
VK 
I was indepen…I was a consultant through the FPAA. I never actually took 
any jobs here. I really didn’t want to, because I wanted the freedom to work for very 
different distributors.  
 
NH 
So how many distributors do you currently work… 
 
VK 
Well interestingly enough, I work for a lot less distributers than I used to, 
because they all handle so many more items. So in the beginning, I could work for 
maybe five or six because they would have non-competing items, but now with the 
competition being so tough, I’m ending up with three or for clients, really, three or 
four distributors, that have different items. Because when you go to the retail chain, 
you have to be careful not to, you know, represent divergent interests. And this is 
one of the things that you’ll find here; people are “friendly”, they’re open, they’re all 
amigos, compadres, but when it comes down to selling that item and getting that 
item into a program in a chain, they’ll kill each other over it.  
 
[both laugh] 
 
NH 
Yeah, the thing is that somebody said that you can talk about all these things, 
but you’re not allowed to talk about this or this.  
 
VK 
Right.  
 
NH 
There was a lot of freedom, I guess, within the boundaries of what people 
talk about.  
 
VK 
Right, right. Well you can’t talk about pricing and…you can’t talk about 
pricing.  
 
NH 
Yup. 
 
VK 
But that’s an anti-trust. But importantly, you know, it is so competitive. So 
competitive. And it has become, it’s been really amazing to me in the last, what, the 
last decade, how the business has changed, how that produce business has changed.

NH 
How do you feel…that’s one thing I’ve asked people when I’ve been 
interviewing them, is how has it changed? That’s one of the…  
 
VK 
Well, and from the, and I said, I wear the other shoes, you know, and I see 
that from a retail standpoint, it has become incredibly competitive and stressful. The 
buyer of produce today is really less concerned with the item and how exciting it is 
than if he can make a profit and can turn it around and has little [shrink]. It has 
become much more of a business proposition. The distributor, on the other hand, 
has had to concentrate on food safety, and all kinds of legal issues that have cost 
them money, you know, and have cost the grower money. So they are much more, as 
I said, concerned with bottom line. I think that somewhere in the middle is the lost 
passion, the passion that drove the industry. That drove the Bill Sykes, that drove 
the Axel Holmes. I think that has been lost in the climate of business today, no doubt 
about it.  
 
NH 
Somebody had said it’s like being a stockbroker, but your stock is perishable 
and you get more the next day.  
 
VK 
Exactly, exactly. [slight pause] And I think as a marketer, and I have to speak 
as a marketer, because I see that there are some issues in Nogales that our members 
and our distributers have to face, and the key one is, and I see it a lot and I’m paying 
attention to this, is that they all [burn the same stuff]. [Me toos]. I think the way to 
succeed in a chain store today is to have something different and unique, a value 
proposition. If you go to a tomato grower and the guy next door also grows 
tomatoes, and the guy down the street also grows tomatoes, then what is going to be 
your value proposition? I think it’s very hard to convince growers because their 
babies are the best-looking babies around. So my job is to tell them sorry, they may 
be the best-looking babies, but your neighbor has good-looking babies too. [slight 
pause] So that’s one of the, as I said, the drawbacks that I see.  
 
NH 
[affirmative noise] Are there any other drawbacks that you… 
 
VK 
I see the fact that the Nogales industry is somewhat cloistered by virtue of 
geography, and attitude. I think that they tend to only see what’s in their backyard. 
They don’t, maybe, have a vision of the big world. I think you probably saw that with 
your other interviews. I think that our job to change that is to really bring the world 
to them, which is what I try to do when I come to see my clients. I travel a lot, I go 
and meet with the supermarket buyers, and see what’s going on in the stores. I tell 
them, this is going on. This is what is going on. You know, you can’t pack your item 
this way because it’s not what this demographic is gonna buy. And they’re not 
thinking that way.

NH 
See, one of the things that coming into this I had read, and I had been doing 
some reading at Eller College at U of A, were talking about McAllen and Florida 
being challenges to Nogales. But when I’ve talked to people, a lot of people don’t 
really see it as a challenge. Some of them have bases in McAllen, so they’re not 
worried, but from your perspective as a marketer, I mean, do you think that, you 
know, because I-69 is coming through Detroit to McAllen, think about it, because it’s 
being built in my home state right now, and so there are people wondering, what’s it 
going to do to Nogales? Is it going to be a bad thing? Is it going to be a good thing? 
But from a marketing perspective, do you have any thoughts on that?  
 
VK 
I think that now we are at an advantage, that we have to take advantage of 
this window, because I truly think things will change. However, with a caveat that 
the other ports, the competing ports, McAllen being one of them, is not, basically it’s 
not appropriate for west-coast shipments. So it’s going to become a regional game. 
It’s also a little more dangerous, I don’t know if you’ve heard, but Highway 2 goes 
through the mountains of Chihuahua and into McAllen, so you’re going to run into a 
lot more issues. [emphasis hers] Here it’s a straight shot from most of the growing 
regions, but as those growing regions expand into Mexico, which they are, it used to 
be the West-Mexico deal, I don’t know if you’ve talked to your other people about 
that, but that’s…the FPAA was the West-Mexico Association of Producers. And 
because the only items that were being imported were from Sinaloa and Sonora. 
Those were the only growing regions. But that’s changed…that’s changed 
dramatically with going into Jalisco, going into Michoacán, we’re going into the 
[Carreto] area outside Mexico City, so it’s now spread out. So that means that yes, 
the roots are going to change. However, the port of Nogales has been remodeled. It’s 
state of the art. Are the other regions going to compete? Yes, but that depends who 
you’re selling to. You know, you’re not going to use McAllen to go to California. 
Makes sense there.  
 
NH 
Somebody had said that one of the things that McAllen didn’t have was the 
strong sense of community that Nogales has.  
 
VK 
True, much bigger.  
 
NH 
Because it’s growing really rapidly, but also some people have said, well, 
McAllen also has a lot more…like they have everything from retail to all the things 
that people want to go through. So I’ve heard very different perspectives on that, 
whether it, you know, whether Nogales has any advantages and let’s say, McAllen 
does.  
 
VK 
Yes. Nogales is very much a small time, and I think that it has its charms to 
some people. The thing that I think keeps, it in many ways, backwards, is the size, 
the way geographically it’s laid out. The way it’s protected by the mountains, almost, 
you know. And we can’t grow that much, except you know, towards Phoenix. I think 
it keeps that certain kind of club feeling about the place, you know, it’s like a club.

[emphasis hers] I don’t think that’s going to change; I think what’s going to happen 
to a lot of the guys here is that they’re going to start, and you’re seeing that 
happening already, I hope you’re going to talk to some of those people, but they are, 
you know, opening greenhouses up north. And what’s happening is that the typical 
Nogales distributor is now going to start being a grower, right? He’s going to grow 
his vegetables in greenhouses, buy land where it’s cheap, in this corridor here. And 
then that would be an [adjunct] to his Mexico production.  
 
NH 
I have talked to a couple of people who swear that they have operations 
there, here in the US, and also in Canada.  
 
VK 
In Canada, and in the southeast. A lot of these guys are growing, a lot of the 
guys you’ve talked to [I may not be one of them] are growing corn in the southeast. 
So what’s happening is that to survive, you know, these guys need to expand their 
production, just as though you were General Motors and you make cars in various 
parts of the country, right? So that’s what they’re doing. The smart ones are doing 
that.  
 
[both laugh] 
 
[14:46] 
 
NH 
Would you mind telling me a little bit about, I always ask people to sort of 
describe what’s up, I know there’s no such thing as a typical work day, but can you 
describe a typical work day? [laughs] 
 
VK 
For me or for a produce person? 
 
NH 
For you! 
 
VK 
For me, okay! Well my whole thing is talking to retailers, and so, well it’s 
probably the same with a lot of the distributor sales desks, but my typical day begins 
with what I think the retail accounts we’re targeting want. I do a lot of work on 
email, through email. Very few phone calls now.  A lot of the chains won’t take phone 
calls. Do you know that we’re having a great shipment of cucumbers coming up? My 
client is going to have this great volume coming up, and you can get it for a hell of a 
deal. Call Jimmy over at the sales desk. So I’m not selling anything; my job is not to 
sell. My job is to set up programs and to tell the retail accounts about the deals that 
are coming up like that. I don’t negotiate pricing; I don’t even touch it.  
 
NH 
Where are a lot of your retailers? Are they all over the country?  
 
VK 
All over the country. But probably I’d say the western chains are the most 
prevalent.

NH 
So it’s like Safeway, Albertsons, or…?  
 
VK 
Yes. Well, Safeway, Albertsons these days are all messed up! They’re the 
same now!  
 
NH 
Yeah, they’ve been on the news. 
 
VK 
And that’s another trend, you know, so there are a couple of things that are 
trending in the business, and one of them is, of course, the consolidation of the 
chains has really changed the business, number one. Number two, the demographics 
of consumers. A lot more ethnic. Some of these houses here are now starting to do 
ethnic produce. The advent of the Whole Foods and Sprouts has changed the 
business; the fact that the consumer is much more adventurous about what he will 
eat. I remember when I started working for the Mango Board in 2006, that was not 
that long ago, very few people, Americans, had tasted a mango!  
 
NH 
I have to confess that I didn’t taste one until I moved here.  
 
VK 
You’re kidding! Wow! 
 
NH 
Okay, I had never bought one… 
 
VK 
You probably had it.  
 
NH 
I tried it, but I had never actually gone…I went to Food City and bought some 
mangoes. But it was the first time I had said, hey, I’m going to actually buy one of 
these and prepare it! 
 
[17:25] 
 
VK 
So that’s the adventurous, the foodies, you know, they’re really changing, as 
being a folklorist, I think you have to look at the evolution of the taste of people, you 
know. I think we’re coming back to some of those more basic foods. I read 
somewhere recently that jackfruit, I don’t know if you’re familiar with jackfruit, but 
it’s something we ate in Brazil. It’s this huge monstrous thing.  
 
NH 
My friends are all about, I have friends who are vegetarian and vegan, and 
they eat it as a barbecue alternative.  
 
VK 
As a barbecue alternative. And to me, it’s a horrendous fruit. [NH laughs] To 
me it has no class whatsoever, it has a very strong odor and flavor. It’s a very 
unrefined item. But this is what some of these people want, because it brings them 
back. The grains…the different grains. One of our clients is processing eggplant to 
make flour so that they can sell it as a natural flour. An eggplant pulverizes 
beautifully into a flour.

NH 
I had no idea!  
 
VK 
You know, you have walnut flour, and almond flour, and eggplant flour. And 
eggplant has a lot of nutrients. So you know, we’re seeing some of the evolution of 
some of these growers. So what can we do with this? Which is smart, because 
they’re thinking, you know, we have reached the saturation of the marketplace. So 
let’s create a product with byproducts, which is an excellent idea, you know, the 
whole sustainability.  
 
NH 
Right. 
 
VK 
Which brings us to the other issue. So the third issue that is becoming critical 
is the whole sustainability/social responsibility. We’ve seen movies about the way 
workers are treated. Huge issue. I feel that that’s going to become even a bigger deal, 
don’t you feel that? Yeah. I feel that our guys here, our guys meaning the Nogales 
team, has done a very good job of becoming aware, becoming media-savvy about it, 
because they’ve been assaulted by the media, and also that they really seem to care, 
and they try to do programs that help their workers. But you can’t do everything. 
You can’t wash their hands for them, you know. And the fact that movie came out, 
you know which one I’m talking about, with Eva Mendez…from last year…are you 
familiar with that?  
 
NH 
I need to… 
 
VK 
It was about the Immokalee tomato workers. It’s called [slight pause] Food 
Wars.  
 
NH 
I should know that, I follow Immokalee workers on Facebook.  
 
VK 
Do you? Yeah, check that out. Because a real eye-opener of a movie.  
 
[slight pause] 
 
NH 
Is it a documentary, or….? 
 
VK 
It’s a documentary. Eva Mendez got funding from…and it really, the heart of 
the movie is about the Amocole workers, but it really addresses all farm workers. 
The problem is that some of these [slight pause] issues that were mentioned are 
really issues that we can’t do much about. For example, the fact that they spend all 
their money before they finish the season. [slight pause] I think education might 
certainly, and as a woman, I feel that we need to help these people, you know, create 
a better family life so that they understand the importance of keeping money and 
not spending it. The other thing is that they, you know, a lot of these people come 
from Chiapas, an area where they don’t sleep on beds, and if they’re cold and they

see a bed, they will burn the bed to keep warm. This is a mentality thing that our 
guys here in Nogales try to create socially-responsible programs. But how are they 
going to address that? [slight pause] You know, it’s got to be through education, but 
it’s a heavy cultural thing.  
 
NH 
Yeah, I can see that. And I have talked to some people, I think, a couple people 
about…there was a labor shortage in Sonora, and they were bringing people down 
from Oaxaca, and there was an issue of child labor, because it was based on output, 
and so the kids were, you know [slight pause] asked to come along, and to be part of 
that rather than going to school. I was pleased that people were bringing it up, but 
it’s something I wonder about, because as a consumer, I wonder about it. You know, 
especially…but I’m glad you’re bringing it up. These are things that I’ve been curious 
to know about, and these are things that I think a lot of people are interested, 
because we’re increasingly wondering where our food comes from, you know, that’s 
probably why local food movements have taken shape because you know your 
grower. Most people don’t know the person that grew their tomatoes who’s come 
from Oaxaca on a seasonal basis.  
 
[22:29] 
 
VK 
The child labor thing is huge. A huge issue, and it has ended now because the 
Mexican government…I mean, pretty much, at least from what they can catch. But I 
think the American public has to understand that these are cultural issues, 
especially when you don’t have money. You’re bringing your…your child is another 
source of income. It’s not that they’re abusing the child. I mean, I think that that’s 
one of the things that has to be taken into consideration. But by the same token, they 
have to go to school. And so there’s enforced school now. And the other thing that’s 
happening, the fifth thing that’s important, that I don’t know if your other 
distributors talk about it, but what you’re seeing here is that the younger 
generation, people your age, are coming into the business, and they don’t 
necessarily want to be in the business anymore. [slight pause] By virtue that it’s a lot 
more competitive, it’s not easy like it used to be, they’re educated, they want to go, 
you know, they want to be the next Internet, they want to be the next Zuckerman 
[sic…does she mean Zuckerberg?]. If they can. And so, this level of education is 
unparalleled in Mexico. I mean, the middle class growth, the middle class explosion, 
and the level of education that families in the farm business have now [were 
un]heard of decades ago. Nobody went to college. So they’re coming out of college 
and going, number one, I don’t want to stay on the farm. Number two, I can make 
more money doing…and less headache…doing something else. So who’s coming to 
run these farms? Who’s going to run these farms when Daddy dies, when [Papa] 
dies? A lot of women getting into it, and the women are bringing, to be honest, 
they’re bringing a completely different perspective. I think that we see, I have clients 
who are female growers, and they are as ruthless as the men, but they also bring 
that perspective of balance. I think it’s really important, you have to balance what 
you’re doing as a business to what the market wants, and they’re much more astute

about the issues I talked to you about. About, you know, the social responsibility, 
sustainability, the nutrition, you know, what are you bringing to the table?  
 
NH 
That’s something I’m curious about because like I said, I have not talked to 
anybody that was not male [laughs], so it’s like, you know, the perspective is very 
valuable. And I think going, talking about the people not wanting to work on the 
farm, it’s very similar to what happened in America in the 20th century, where it was 
Wendell Berry who said that it was, I think it was in the ‘20s or ‘30s, that dirt started 
to be a bad thing. People didn’t want to mess with dirt. And you know, I have friends 
who grew up on farms. I didn’t want to farm! Farming was something you did on the 
side, you know, you don’t make a living out of it nowadays. So it’s almost as if what 
happened in America is now happening in Mexico.  
 
[25:36] 
 
VK 
Right. [slight pause] And you know, the production, of course, is drifting 
southward; you see a lot more central American production, because that is 
happening. And of course, the value of the land. Those things [are] happening in 
California. Pretty soon we’re going to going to have a water problem down there, 
right?  
 
[slight pause] 
 
NH 
Hopefully they don’t have to deal with what California’s going through.  
 
VK 
No, hopefully not.  
 
NH 
Yeah. 
 
VK 
And I think that, one of the things that people don’t know about Mexico 
agriculture specifically, its’ very advanced. The people that are doing it right, the 
people who are successful, are extremely sophisticated, and usually they have a lot 
more money than the American farmers. The rich in Mexico are very rich. That’s 
something that you don’t realize, and they live a very wealthy life, and I think a lot of  
Americans think that all Mexicans are poor. The poor are very poor, but the 
sophisticated growers, the ones whose food we are eating in the United States, 
because they have had the systems to export [slight pause] are extremely wealthy, 
extremely sophisticated. They’ve put systems up before the American farmer even 
considered them, and that’s something that you don’t realize. And when you go to 
the south here to look at some American farming operations, they are surprised, the 
Mexicans are surprised how backwards they are.  [slight pause] I think that’s very 
interesting.

Do you think it’s because a lot of what America grows is not edible? [slight 
pause] Because we focus…I’m from Indiana, where it’s a three-crop state. Wheat, 
soybeans, corn. Soybeans and corn, most of that… 
 
VK 
It’s [not processed].  
 
NH 
…goes into ethanol. Where I’m from, my hometown has two ethanol plants. 
So almost none of that corn is edible. And a lot of people, I mean, it goes to feeding 
animals, sweeteners, and fuel.  
 
VK 
It could be, in the middle states, but then you get up to, let’s say, potato 
country in North Dakota, and a lot of it is edible. Some of it is made into sugar, and 
[actually grow sugar beets], but I think it is because they don’t export. So they don’t 
have to go through the extensive [slight pause] check points and audits. I’m sure 
you’ve heard in your conversations about the third-party audits that are required?  
 
NH 
[affirmative noise] 
 
VK 
Tremendous amount of inspection work that costs them a lot of money. I 
think if you’re from the States, you just ship the item. [slight pause, dripping noise in 
background] That’s like a drip…

That’s what it sounds like. That’s ok. That’s fine, I’ll just write down that 
there’s a drip in the background.

I think Jerry Wagner was talking about, somebody was talking about, how 
one of the biggest investors in Mexican produce is Israel, and a lot of people were 
coming in and building very highly technical operations because the climate was 
similar. [slight pause] And I was amazed by that, because now it makes sense in my 
head, because I’ve read enough on agriculture…Gary Nabham wrote a book on the 
parallels between the Arabian desert and the Sonoran desert, you know… 
 
VK 
Oh, I never heard about that. 
 
NH 
Yeah, his family are Lebanese descent.  
 
VK 
Lebanese descent, yeah… 
 
NH 
So he said that there are a lot of very similar things happening. But yeah, 
that’s one thing that everybody has talked about, is that it’s very high tech, but, you 
know, where I’m from in the Midwest, people do think, you know, the only people

that are from Mexico from this area, are day laborers or they work in a restaurant. 
So I think what I’ve learned is that it says a lot about…I’ve learned a lot about…I’ve 
grown to understand people’s perspectives of Mexico when you don’t live near the 
area and don’t have a greater understanding of it. I think about that from a 
consumer’s perspective as well.  
 
VK 
Yeah. The consumer is very sheltered, and very myopic about what really 
goes on. The Israeli cooperation, I would say, especially in Sonora, has been 
tremendous. It has revolutionized the grape industry. They brought in the trellis 
sytems, and of course, because their universities are fantastic, and their university 
training. The other thing that has helped is the partnerships with Chile, you know, 
and that’s created some issues…culture issues. But in the end, Mexico has been very 
open-minded. This is one of the things that Americans don’t realize. Mexico has been 
very open-minded in teaming up with Cubans, Brazilians, Chinese, Syrians [slight 
pause] Egyptians, whatever. Whoever has the technology and who can partner with 
them, they’ve partnered. They don’t have the political issues that we have here. And 
to their advantage. You get countries like Brazil, on the other hand, and Brazil, of 
course, is very sophisticated agriculturally. But it was started by the Japanese! 
[slight pause] That’s really where…and it’s still run by the Japanese. [emphasis hers]. 
I think that Mexico, you know, has broadened the acceptance of other cultures, 
starting with the Greeks. Starting with the Chinese. So it’s interesting to see that, in a 
way, much more harmonious, and just multi…I don’t know, multi-cultural, I guess. 
And it makes America look backward. [slight pause] In contrast. [slight pause] 
So…we’ll keep that quiet. [laughs] 
 
NH 
Yeah, that’s the thing that people don’t realize about countries like Brazil, I 
mean, when I lived in Canada, Brazil was a major investor in Atlantic Canada.  
 
VK 
Oh yeah.  
 
NH 
Well, the mines were all own by Vale…Vale-INCO. Our planes for Air Canada 
were all Embraer. You know, it’s… 
 
VK 
Vale is huge. It’s one of the biggest employers in the country.  
 
NH 
Yeah, people don’t…people think, oh, it’s south of the border, something most 
people…and never as good as America. And even, they treat Canada like that too a 
little bit.  
 
VK 
Yeah, I know, I know. Hopefully that’ll change.  
 
[32:02]

idea of sustainability and social responsibility. Because that’s something that, first

off, I think people in the archive will…people want to know about this stuff. Because 
it’s on the mind…it has to be on the minds of the consumers, and eventually, you 
know, for anything to change. But, you know, you’re providing a lot of really good 
information for me about that, because like I said, I’ve talked to…mostly growers 
and distributors with an extensive amount of media training, and that sort of 
relationship going on. Have I asked…I can’t think if I’ve asked you already. What are 
some of the, for you personally, what are some of the challenges of working in the 
produce industry, or working with the produce industry, because you work sort of 
with it, but not… 
 
VK 
I’m in it, but not of it, as they say in the Bible. I’m in it, but not of it. But I think 
that’s the strength that I bring to the equation, is that I’m not, you know, a 
distributor. The challenges that I face as I market and try to get these products in, 
again, as I mentioned to you, is the fact that everybody wants to grow the same 
thing. Why? Because if [Fulano] there is growing it, then it must be good. There is 
that herd mentality, and I need to separate the herd. That’s my job. That’s the 
hardest part of my job.  
 
NH 
You’re like an anti-shepherd.  
 
VK 
Anti-shepherd! Exactly. [emphasis hers] I want to bring them out…I want to 
show them what’s happening in the world. The other thing is, just unwillingness to 
spend money. Just they don’t want to spend the money on the marketing. They 
know the sales desk, they see the sales desk producing, but they have very little 
understanding of what marketing does, and how marketing drives demand. That’s 
one of my biggest challenges, if not the biggest.  
 
[33:58] 
 
NH 
Do you…you know, we were talking about how a lot of women are starting to 
get involved in the produce industry. Are there…I mean, do you work with a lot of 
other women in Nogales itself, or is it mostly men?  
 
VK 
Yeah, it’s, the women who are involved in produce are mostly at the grower 
and at the buyer level. There are very few women who actually…[Rosie Favela] is 
one who actually buys product, and she’ll be…give you a great perspective. But there 
are a lot more women buyers at the retail chain level. That makes my work a lot 
better, because I can…we identify right away, we as women, as women in the food 
business, being a woman is the first understanding. And it is the critical 
understanding, because we feed the world. I mean, that’s the way we look at it as 
women. And the business will come, you know. If I have a product, for example, I call 
Safeway and the gal there who buys squash hears that I have a product that cooks in 
half the time…a squash variety that cooks in half the time. And it looks fantastic. And 
it has a shelf life of two weeks…cuts in half the time, and is cheaper than the normal 
squash she’s been buying. Right away she’s interested as a consumer. That’s her first

reaction, this is going to be good, and grown in completely safe and sustainable 
manner. You know, it all has to be there. You can’t just have a good product. Is it 
grown well, is the volume there? Then, then…we will get to the price or the 
availability. With the men, the first thing [sounds like she banged her fist on the 
table with each italicized word in this sentence] got a deal for you, got a truck, x 
dollars. You see what I’m saying? It’s just…I think it’s just that women are much 
more interested in, you know, what are we eating? That’s their job. [slight pause] 
And we, I’ve helped my clients do some things that they wouldn’t normally do. For 
example, one of my clients grows garlic in the Rio Sonora, which is just down the 
road here. It’s a river that is in a beautiful valley, pristine valley, nobody knows 
about it.  
 
NH 
We’ve done our field school for SFA there.  
 
VK 
Oh, did you go there?  
 
NH 
I haven’t been there, but we do our field school…it’s in Banamichi. 
 
VK 
Banamichi. Well that whole area there is historically farmland, small farms. 
But it’s now getting to be big. It’s going to be a big thing. This Rio Sonora area. And 
what I’m trying to do is organize the garlic growers. Garlic is grown there; it’s a 
beautiful purple garlic that competes with the California garlic, which I think by 
virtue of the land and the water thing, [there’s going to be] less production in 
California. So we’re going to look down there, and it’s not bleached like the Chinese 
garlic! So what do we do? We tell the consumer, we tell the media, don’t buy 
bleached garlic. [emphasis hers] You don’t want to eat food that is bleached.. You 
know, if you have a choice to eat a garlic that is bleached and a garlic that has no 
bleach, that, to me, is a non-brainer [sic].  
 
NH 
Just eating bleach… 
 
VK 
[laughs] Eating bleach is like, [disgusted noise]. So that’s been my job, is to 
say, you’ve got something really exciting here. You’ve got a non-bleached garlic that 
tastes fantastic.  
 
NH 
Does California garlic get bleached?  
 
VK 
Well, they do bleach, but the Chinese product is completely bleached.  
 
NH 
Okay, I just wonder, I have a jar of California in my fridge and I was 
wondering!  
 
VK 
The purple garlic that you’re going to see more of is the real, true...Hi! [greets 
another person who comes in…?] So [slight pause] that’s one of the…so what do I 
do? I’ve got an area here that is pristine. An area that has very little pollution, very

little cross-contamination, because it’s isolated, you’ve got this beautiful river, 
you’ve got these beautiful pictures that we can take, that are important. You’ve got 
these growers that have been growing this…you know, their families have been 
growing it since the thirties. And only now they’re getting commercialized. Let’s 
organize them into a grower group, and promote them…the strength of the 
numbers. Those are the things that I bring to the party, you know…and it’s like, 
wow, that’s a great idea, because they only thought of them as individual growers, 
they didn’t think…well, as a collective, you have a lot more power. You know, you 
can go in and promote an area, and help them. And the other thing that we’re doing 
a lot of is try to get money back to the grower through the sales programs. Back to 
their communities. So one cent out of every garlic clove sold goes back to the 
community. Why? To educate their people. So those are some of those things that 
are part of the social fabric of growing food. And I tell you what, there are some 
chains that if you don’t have a program like this, you’re not getting in. [slight pause] 
Puget Sound Co-Op. Some of the co-ops you see that are becoming very powerful 
now, food co-ops. And I see that as a trend…I see that trend is going to be [slight 
pause] huge. [emphasis hers] I see the food business is going into huge 
conglomerates like the Safeway, Albertsons, Kroger. It’s going to be that, and there’s 
going to be no one in the middle. And there’s going to be the small, the Sprouts, the 
co-ops, the Whole Foods, even. 
 
[39:19] 
 
NH 
Co-Op in Canada is getting out of the grocery business.  
 
VK 
Why is that?  
 
NH 
Just not doing well. It was all…the Atlantic co-op was one of the first 
cooperative stores in Canada, but my…because my in-laws, that’s the only store in 
their town, is the Co-Op, and now it’s going to be a Sobeys.  
 
VK 
Oh, Sobeys bought them off. But Co-Op in Canada is not a real Co-Op though, 
it’s just called Co-Op.  
 
NH 
Yeah, I don’t know…. 
 
VK 
Yeah, what I mean by Co-Op is a group of stores that are owned by the 
consumers.  
 
NH 
Right, that’s what this is! That’s what this is.  
 
VK 
Oh, okay!

[slight pause] 
 
VK 
Very hard to be. The other thing that you see trending are retailers being 
their own growers. You see that Costco now, they want to grow their own product. 
They’re going to be growers. So they go to Mexico, they want to run their farms, you 
know, they want to get into that. The other thing you’re seeing in the east, I don’t 
know if you’ve seen that, is rooftop gardens in the supermarkets. So chains…I think, 
[Wegmans]… 
 
NH 
The Halifax Farmers’ Market… 
 
VK 
Halifax did that?  
 
NH 
Yes, yeah. It’s because it’s right by the cruise ship terminal. But the farmers’ 
market has…yeah, we…that’s the place where my wife is from, so… 
 
VK 
Yeah…isn’t that…and to me, this is very exciting. Are the guys here on top of 
that? [slight pause] I think that they are still struggling to move their product 
through a volume model, and the volume model is no longer viable. [slight pause] 
It’s becoming less viable.  
 
[41.02] 
 
NH 
Is it a product of maybe, I don’t know, it was the ‘50s or ‘60s when the 
Agriculture Secretary said “get big or get out.”  
 
VK 
Get big, get big. Yeah. 
 
NH 
I feel like it was the guy under Nixon, can’t remember his name…he’s been in 
a couple documentaries for…I can’t remember. But the “get big or get out” idea.  
 
VK 
Yeah. [slight pause] Well, the “get big” is certainly what it’s going to take for 
an Albertsons, Safeway. That’s why they merged! Because they have to be bigger, 
because they have to buy in scale. It’s the Walmart model. But that is not the only 
model, right? And I think if you are a distributor…if you are a member here in 
Nogales, you can’t all be selling to Walmart, you know. You’ve got to find different 
outlets in different markets. You have to grow items that maybe the smaller Co-Op is 
going to want. That’s why the “me too” thing. I think the guys you have talked to, 
mostly are “me too” guys. [slight pause] Talk to some of the guys that are doing 
something really bizarre and different, growing down the street, like Wholesome 
Harvest and those guys. Did you talk to them?

No.

I guess one of the last things I want to ask: is there anything…because I’m 
thinking about this project. Somebody in Sheboygan, Wisconsin wants to know 
about the produce industry, or somebody, let’s say, in Bangor, Maine. And so I 
always ask people, is there anything we haven’t talked about that you feel that 
people should know about your work with the produce industry that we haven’t 
talked about?  
 
VK 
That we haven’t talked about. Gosh. That we haven’t addressed. [slight 
pause] You’re talking about the pitfalls?  
 
NH 
Yeah, you talked about the challenges. 
 
[slight pause] 
 
VK 
Well, one of the dirty little secrets, right, you want to know a dirty little 
secret? Is the flat consumption of produce. And this is something that we never 
seem to arise from, although there are a lot of government agencies working, there’s 
the Produce for Better Health, as you’re familiar with, the PBH. We’re talking about a 
consumption level that has really never risen beyond two or three points a year, 
which statistically is negligible. [slight pause] What are we going to do about that?

Page 18 of 20 
Are we getting the produce to the people that need to eat more produce? Of course, 
another trend is the whole urban trend. [emphasis hers] Some chains are actually 
going and targeting urban areas. I don’t know if that’s going to make that needle go 
up.  
 
NH 
Whole Foods is getting into downtown, inner-city New Orleans.  
 
VK 
Yeah, they’re doing urban. Don’t know if that’s going to make the needle go 
up. I think that as, you know, in Canada they eat 10 a day, here we eat 5 a day. You 
know, that whole thing. What is it? Is it a cultural thing? Are we going to be the fast 
food nation forever? I don’t know how to answer that. But we’re not doing enough 
to build demand. And we can’t push more product into, you know, the channels, 
without increasing demand. And so, I don’t know, I don’t have the answer to that, 
except there’s got to be a lot more consumer education. I think it needs to be…the 
schools need to get more involved.  
 
[44:58] 
 
NH 
It’s happening slowly.  
 
VK 
Yeah, not fast enough.  
 
NH 
We have the…SNAP does the…farmers’ markets work with USDA to do the 
SNAP double dollars program, where… 
 
VK 
Oh, is that… 
 
NH 
Yeah, it’s happening in farmers’ markets, where if you spend $10 in SNAP 
benefits, you get $20 in produce, and that’s usually grant supported by the USDA, 
and also by the people who fundraise. I have a couple t-shirts that I bought to help 
raise money. One says “I Eat Local Because I Can”, it has a picture of a mason jar on 
it. But those programs are, especially in places in the south, where produce 
consumption is [slight pause] very low, and the diabetes rate is horrible. I mean, 
when you’re one of the ten unhealthiest states in America, it’s one of the target areas 
for those programs.  
 
VK 
[affirmative noise] Yeah. I think that, boy. [slight pause] That’s going to have 
to change. That’s going to be the key thing. You know, people get hung up on 
sustainability, social responsibility, but if you’re producing so much, and America 
produces so much food, there’s so much waste. Another dirty little secret: have we 
talked about shrink? Have you talked to your guys about how much is dumped? 
[slight pause] There is…our dump is at capacity. We do have food banks, but they 
can’t take produce that is not at a certain level, you know. People say, you’ve got 
food banks! Why is all the food…well, because they reject food. [emphasis hers] You

know. Because their customers, whoever they give to, is going to reject food. And 
they can’t have contaminated foods.  
 
NH 
You don’t want to get sick off the food bank. That would be the worst thing.  
 
VK 
Sick off the food bank! So you know, we have today, we have a huge 
cucumber outbreak. I don’t know if you follow that.  
 
NH 
Yes, I’m following that.  
 
VK 
Yeah. So what does that mean? It means that the systems are not zero 
accurate. There are going to be slips. Or, I think the sheer number, you know, what is 
happening is that the sheer volume of produce is raising the inspection rate, right? 
There’s more to inspect. It’s like, I don’t know if you read [Malcolm Freedman], but 
he writes great books about outliers and what statistics  really mean. He says, you 
know, there are lies, damn lies, and then there’s statistics. [both laugh] You know, 
they said, for example, the crime rate in New York has decreased 5%. Well, if you 
look at that number…or 10%, whatever. The crime rate has decreased because the 
people who commit the crimes are older. 50-year olds don’t commit crimes, 30-year 
olds commit crime. So, you know, that’s why you have to be careful with the 
statistics. That the people say, well, people are getting sick much more often! Well, 
that’s not necessarily correct. It’s just that they’re getting caught, because the 
inspections are much more prevalent. So I suspect that there were deaths from 
cucumber poisoning years ago, but they just never knew what it was.  
 
NH 
And then we had things like the peanut butter guy getting sentenced.  
 
VK 
The peanut butter guy.  
 
NH 
That was 28 years, or something. 
 
VK 
28 years. And that’s because he basically misled…I think one of the things 
that a lot of our guys have been trained by the media and by the FPAA that you need 
to…you cannot lie about the issue. You know, if you’ve got a contamination issue and 
it emerged from your plant because you were negligent, then you must say so. We 
were negligent. We admit. If you try to hide that, then all hell’s going to break loose. 
And you deserve…you deserve what comes to you. [emphasis hers] If you’re lying 
about our food source. You know, I think he wouldn’t have gotten this thing if he had 
been straight from the beginning.  
 
NH 
Yeah.  
 
VK 
So I think all the dirty little secrets are out, at least the ones I can reveal 
without somebody coming out and killing me. [laughs] I hope I’ve given you enough!
