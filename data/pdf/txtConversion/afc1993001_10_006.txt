Studies lesson on Iran.
 After locating Iran on the larger

the classroom to illustrate cultural diversity in the Middle
 
East and the Muslim population of several Middle Eastern
 
countries.
 Well prepared, Sr. Diana involves the children
 
through direct questioning (e.g.,  #10 and  #22); illustra-
tions in National Geographic magazines and books  (e.g.,
 
#3,  #16-18,  and #31); samples of some typical foods  (e.g.,
 
#8),  in this case dates;  demonstration of dressing in a
 
chaddor, the outer garment of the women of Iran,  consist-
ing of a long draped cloth covering the head and body  (
e.g.,
 
#25-28);  and examples of photographs taken when she was in
 
Iran in 1978 to be married  (
e.g.,  #32 & #33).
 
Sr. Mary and Sr. Diana took turns writing important words
 
or terms in Arabic or Persian  (
Farsi)  on the blackboard
 
(e.g.,  #2 and #14).
 
Mrs. Crum participating in the lesson  (#11).
 
Sr.  Diana bringing the lesson to a close with postcards
 
from cities in Iran,  especially those having famous or
 
well known mosques such as Isfahan in the central part of
 
the country  (
e.g.,  #36 & #36A).
 
Additional items for the lesson included recorded Iranian
 
drum music and a samovar, a metal urn used throughout the
 
Middle East and Eastern Europe to make tea (
see #24, back-
ground).
