9 Four categories used in judging: hunting, trailing, speed & drive, 
and endurance 
10 Cole; father had dogs all life. 15 years ago started; keeps 20-30 gogs.

Caldwell read about this trial in Hunters Horn 
Blows horn

section of Floyd County ...... . . 
What do people do up here at night while trial is onf Mostly just 
hound talk/ listening to the chase. Punning not as good as it usedto 
be- trapping the biggest cause of it. Young foxes not given a chance 
to breed back. Stop importing of furs, get price back, improve.

1 GIVE THE WORLD A SMILE EACH DAY. Sung by Caldwell, Avis, 
and Trent Schuyler, with piano by Mr . Ted Draughan. 
3 GIVE THE WORLD A SMILE EACH DAY * tke 2, better balance. 
6 Mrs Draughan talks about playing with the Lone Star Quartet 
over Raleigh radio. About 40 years ago. Bert Carrol, Elmer 
Johnson, Carl Raines, and a bass singer was the qt. Give 
the world their theme. Daily show about 9s00 in morning. 
Travelled every night. 
8 How get new songs; getting new songbooks; seven shaped note 
books. WPTL on radio Raleigh. 
Played schools at night; tehools would take tax out of the 
gate to help school costs. Most shows the Qt would charge 
$1.00, for a 2 hour show. Played piano solos, had a little 
comedy with it. Joe Squashhead (Carl Raines) did routine 
10 Never did any music except gospel. 
Goodbye World Goodbye one of her specialties; Keep on the 
Firing Line. 
11 I'M GOING TO SEE HEAVEN. Solo by Mrs. Draughan on piano. 
13 KEEP ON THE FIRING LINE. " " 
15 She was valuable to the Qt because they needed someone to 
transpose; to drop into lower key for qt., have to be able 
to do it from book; can do it because its shaped music. 
This an advantage of shape note. Noone else in Raleigh 
could do this; I've never studied round notes; I often 
16 take round note book, fix shape notes toit so I can play.

7 Irving Gallimorej comes from a moonshining family, plays el gtr

9 Bill and Marshall talk about how they left the church and 
convention; largest churches in every state are Independent 
Baptists; seem they do better. 
9.5 Difference between yourself and southern Baptists? Primitive 
Baptists? They are Calvinistic (primitives) - they call us Arministic 
Armanian, but we're not. Armanism and Prim Baptists Largen 
both considers man made doctorines. 
10 Diff between Prim Baptist and Missionary Baptist (according to 
Bill Scott); about 1849 So Baptists wanted to have Sunday schools 
and evangelistic services and supporjr missionaries. Prim Baptists 
disagreed on Sunday school and missionaries ($1), (SS#2). 
Split. After that, 75 years ago, got Co-op program set up by So Bap. 
But wlike big government, there's nothing you can do about it 
12 when things get going." - Largen 
Found that So Baptist co op had invested money in stocks for 
companies selling alcoholic beveredges. 
14 "Don't think the Lord aimed for it to get that big" - Bill Scott, 
referring to So Baptist convention. Too, much involved in worldly 
systems. 
Independent Church (theirs) 6 years old in March 
(They are building church themselves) 
15 Independent church very antoginistic to people. 
How Marshall left convention.

20 Bill Scott's son in law one of singers in Montgomery Family; 
now dissolved; had a hig bus; Dolly (Darlene) Dalton Montgomery 
daughter; Odell Dalton husband; lives in Hillsville. 
Who played what (of. record later acquired for files) 
24 Asked about old singers of ballads; Jim Marshall mentioned. 
26 Martin Marshall mentioned again; old banjo player. Played 
Poole style. 
29 Played fiddle with Martin Marshall (Largen did) one best 
tunes "THre'll Come a Time*' 
Poole supposedly a moonshiner; story of how "There'll Come a Time" 
written after Poole's wife died; down at Eden NC, story heard. 
All up and down the edge of this mountain was all moonshining - 
Bill Scott. "Why it wasn't even safe for one of them little 
light cover airplanes to fly over." Scott. 
30 Pastor's father had still, would chase men with double edged hatchett. 
And they would take a fence post and put the liquor under it 
(says Barbara); said there's liquor under some of those fence posts yet.

was so loud, it was too loud for the recording instruments, 
and they bought cloth to put in the resonator in the back, 
and when Rakes got it, (the banjo), the cloth was still in it. 
7 Newer generation doesn't know who Poole was. 
Riley Puckett played blues, but Poole refined stuff - Largen. 
Rakes played therefined stuff too. 
8 Largen as fiddler, where he learned his tunes; 
10 Bill Scott listens to music constantly on the radio, AM/FM. 
11 Jack Holton a favorite of Barbara; WHPE an all religion station. 
Slick Christianity songs discussed by Largen. 
12 Largen's favorite groups The Chesnut Grove Quartet 
Another groups Primitive Baptist Lesere(?) Bradley (don't like

Talk of auction Jim helped condusct on Sept. 9 (this taped, 
see cassette on it) 
"Filler" phuases in auctioneerj country auctioneer wouldn't 
know this. One auctioneer in Galax can still do country 
auctioneering; Luther Davis. I used to work with him 30 years 
ago selling cattle all night long. 
Sometimes I'd be 3 cows behind remembering who bought & who 
paid for it. Could do it then. 
rmsic at auctions; not much lately, play recorded music. 
Uncle Wade and Jimmy Edmonds used -- all used to use live music. 
We played for our own auctior some. 
Not too much auction until 20 years ago; only courthouse 
sales. Court would sell property on courthouse lawn. 
Where name Colonel; Colonels in Civil War would be disposing 
of captured property at these courthouse sales. 
When you play? Before auction, and lull in real estate, if you 
thought not bringing enough, go talk to someone and talk them 
into giving more for pcoperty. Used tapes for same purpose. 
We use old time bluegrass music, local mostly. Wore*Jimmy Martin 
out, and got an Art Wooten tape. Albery Hash tape. We have thought 
about doing our own - want fast music, better sale. Thought of° 
itj designing a tape for auction sales. Fast moving - don't 
want a draggy waltz. Parsons in Galax one of oldest companies 
around. Uncle Wade Ward used to play a lot for them. 
Auctions, dances, pis suppers - ways for old time music to 
make a little money. Usually at pie suppers all you got was a 
piece of pie. 
Being a musician has helped being an auctioneer; its kinda related.

End of prior programming and station intro of Combs show 
AMAZING GRACE, sung unacc. by all four singers. 
Prayer by Combs, remembering the sick and dedications 
THE GREAT BEYOND, sung by Rev. Combs and Mrs. York. 
Sung in unison; very nice. 
Combs begins to preach, starting from the point on the 
sermon. 
Remembering the sick and those behind prison bars 
Art and Virginia Galmore, dedicate the song, gets pretty 
long. 
The Galmores sing PRECIOUS MEMORIES, unaccompanied, 
in unison. Virginia blows the first chorus, chokes’or 
something. Soon back in in. 
Virginia's at it again; voice cracking, missing. 
-‘•his is a very disjointed perfomance; now Virginia seems 
trying a little falsetto. 
Amen, says Combs. 
Artie, do you have I MEET YOU IN THE MORNING, (scuffles) in book? 
Go out to the car and get it. 
Door opens. 
Prayer time. Bov/ your heads. Prayer begins. 
Door opens again; now they have the right book. 
Luke 14jl, read. Snuffles nose. Reads. 
Reading continues, with commentary 
Finishes reading. Bible says we not to exalt ourselves. 
Cannot bless when we do that. Reflections on this. Do not 
take the high seat 
When you work for the Lord, you expect no return. Too many 
will not work for God when no one can see them. 
Has God heard your cries? Humble yourself — you can't do this 
and still take the high seat. 
Voice cracks during invitation; very emotional 
Ends rather abruptly, runs out of time.

Dedications; "don't know where the tent will be next'/ not 
sure about setting up in Pulaski, 
BUILD A WINDOW, sung by Rev. Ai$!j&H£kers, with guitar, mandolin, 
piano acc. (Title may be THROUGH THE UPPER WINDOW) 
Brother Shute comes to testify 
Going into the word of God now for the time we have remaining." 
Thane of sermon: Obeying God. Text: Lev. , Deut. gv 
(chapter and verse not identified) ^ rtfows 
Lot of churches stern in keeping discipline within church; 
organizations say we have to preach what they say. 
Not what man says to you, though, but what God says that 
counts. Church discipline OK, but word of God paramount. 
Getting saved is not enough. God gave laws through Moses, 
lawing every element of life style. 
(Good preaching style, with rhythmic punctuations of "hahl" 
every sentence or phrase - possibly interjection from congregation?) 
More of same as he builds to another crescendo, short phrases. 
Another build; "our streets today are polluted." 
Find evil right here in Hillsyille. Judgement day on the wyy. 
Another crescendo: door of oportunity open today 
"People today knocking on doors throughout the community and 
people swallowing at Glory to God like a trout swallows a 
worm in a stream." They don’t know that they's going to be 
destroyed. "Honey, you better straighten up your life." 
"You prove to God that you want to serve God, and then God will 
help you straighten out your life." 
Punctuation by hitting on pulpit; sounds like chairs turning over 
too; "some of you listening to this program for 13-14 years 
and noever done anything about it." 
"Yes, my friend, there's a payday down the road...." 
Station fades out feed at this point, as preaching got 
too involved to end on time. 
Opening strains of WORD OF LIFE program, Marshall Largen family, 
singing IN TIL® LIKE THESE.

0 Jetting ug^. ^dler asks how long to do bushel of apples. 
I Background noise; noise of apple peeler at work. Apples hitting 
barrel. Apples sold for $5 a bushel. More sounds of peeling. 
3 Discussion of apple trees; Ben Davis tree in yard. 
Davis apples not to popular on mkt; people wanted a more built 
up apple. Magnum Bonums have gone out now too. Hundreds other. 
Later varieties brought diseases in. After shipping so far, we 
had to use insecticides. New apples cant stand what old ones did. 
5 Old taste 'ftmore crude.w Not as good flavored or rich. Host smaller. 
(Conversation w Bob Fulcher) as ones today. 
5.5 Old games: pig eye. Make hole, ground, ball lay in it, put toes 
around it, one of boys mention certain one around ball, and when 
name called or finger pointed, ikll run, he d pick up ball and 
try to hit someone. Hit one was caller next time. Hard ball, or 
thread ball used. 
7 Bull pen j 15 ft sq pen, one ball, four on outside, pass ball 
to each other and keep hittin them in pen til all out. Hard ball. 
9 Draw base: played, forgot how to do it. 2 teams throw vball at 
each other. Stink base? Never heard of it. Frog in the middle? 
Played it, but cant remember. Had rhyme to it. 
Ante over: 2 groups, throw ball over house (anteney over, here 
10 she comes" was cry. Used to call out "Mistake" when ball thrown. 
II Fox and hounds. Yes. Used to run all over woods playing that. 
Any games with knives? Yes. Mumble-peg, stick the knife up. 3 
ways to stick it; straight up oh end o straight blade, that got 
100 points; half open blade was 50 points; would play to certain 
14 points, 500 out or something. 
Don'1 remember many of old rhymes for games. Big interest was 
craft; making onething; seeing machinery, furniture; used to 
make own toys; little wagons, plows, tools, etc. saw odd wheels 
15 off round log in woods. 
BR8-CW-R62, pa^ 2 
15.5 Never made any toys with moving parts 
16 When played games? Schools, home weekends, at churoh. 
17 Bushel by now dried, ready to start slicing. 
18 Still more sounds of peeler and crickets. 
19 Cut into 12 pieces for drying. (apples) Wife does most of the cuttiig 
v/hile I fire up dry house. Daughters comes in (20), "Everybody has to 
20 work") says Easter. 
22 General ambient noise of peeling continuing 
25 Lot tries to dry on top of car or roof, says Easter. Make a diff in 
taste? Yes, the insects don t get on them in dry house; heat so extreme 
no insects get to them; thats the point that got me to make dry 
25.5 house, couldnSt stand thought of insects 
Ever dry squashes? Don't know of ever did. Suppose similar to 
punkin. Always can squashes. Other vegetables? Beans, can dry them, 
berries, plums, (make prunes), in dry houses anything. Grapes - make 
28 your own raisins. Tried it a few times. Peaches. Famous thing. 
Mother couldn't keep dried peaches. 
Mrs. Easter tells story of eating peaches, when 7 or 8; we'd 
sneak into sweet dried fruit, almost make ourselves sick, always 
find us there; had to keep eyes on us all time; sweet apples. 
30 Yes, we dry sweet potatoes; "that's another rare thing." 
Not many fruit jars in old days 
31 Some family history, about building his main house.

0 Mrs JE asks if dryers need cleaning. More sounds of peeling. 
1-3 General talk small talk while peeling. 
4 ; ny kind of apple good when dry; these are stamens. The delisious, 
red or golden, good & rich. Goldens a little weak when in fried 
into a pie (Mrs E) 
5 Talk of how he built apple peeler 
7 Cider press, used to have big cider makings; granddaddy had a cider mill! 
Festival at MT Airy has cider press in fall 
10 Talk in general about molasses, lassy makin. Not much of interest.

22 XEnraxfcE start fire, then apples in. 
Break up as moving mike, etc., to dry house. Mrs. E takes over the 
peeler operation. 
25 Now; ready to go. 
Adler asks Easter when built shed. 6-7 years. Big because thought 
might want to dry lumber in it as wrell. Has dried lumber, often. 
Idea or design? Just by my head, way I thought it would w;ork. 
26 No style or plan. Daddy had one, when 10 yrs old. Not quite this 
long and head high, long door, racks turned other w;ay, slide dryers 
on racks. Rock furnace, not sheet iron, as this one. Pole braces; 
seen so much of it various bldgs, took that plan. 
29 We call it dry house; have had furnace on ground, let hot tocks 
warm fruit; call dry kiln eatlier. This better, fewer insects. 
Shed roof; flat roof. A, gamble roof headed both w;ays. Dry house 
not necessarily always has flat roof. End formal interview. 
30 Easter gets apples to dry. 
Trays or dryers, proper term. 
Sounds of inserting dryers. 
31 How many apples per season; 50-100 lbs usually for us & others.

80 Hunting gensing, with his buddy. He has seme growing in a garden, and 
hunts it wild. Both he and his buddy have. Plant roots. Have to keep the 
location secret; high priced stuff and people would steal it. Sell it 
in Galax, but can get more taking it N Wilkesboro, KY, or just ship. Has 
brought 95 dollars a pound. But they've messed it up, stopped shipping it 
124 across the water. 
(Mr. Jack Hatton ) People deplete wild crop of "sing"- 6-8 years you 
can raise sing and sell. 33% dehidration of average 3 oz root; dry it 
by putting on scr en wire, on shade, or in attic, takes 3 weeks. Got to 
have i air circulate. Make tea off leaves. I use it all time (sing) 
boil like tea, dred root ccmes back again, .

leukemia germ killed with gensing. That Smithsonian magazine; they dont
