WHISKEY YOU'RE THE DIVIL, 
Composed and sung by th3 great JERRY BIRRINGTON.

NOW brave boys, we're on for marching

Drums are beating, colors flying,

HORUS. 
With my real royal al da dah, with my real royal al dadah, 
My real royal addy oh, there's whiskey in the jar, 
Oh whiskey you're the divil, you've led me astray; 
Over hills and over mountains, and out of the way. 
You're stronger, sweeter, decenter, and spunkyer than tea 
Oh whiskey, you're my darling, drunk or sober. 
Say's the mother do not wrong me, 
Do not take my daughter from me, 
For if you do, I 
will torment you, 
And after death, my ghost will haunt you. 
Love, farewell, 
With my real, &c. , 
Now the drums are beating boldly, 
Men are dying, hot and coldly; 
Give every man his flask of powder, 
And his firelock on his shoulder, 
Love, farewell.

ONE Mick MacGee, from Arranafee, who once was a 
bold 
sailor oh, 
But growing old, as I've been told, he turned a 
liquor dealer 
oh, 
To license Mick would not agree, or pay the excise bounty 
oh, 
But he sould away, both night and day, and beat the excise 
of the county oh. 
CilORUS. 
Arrah grammachree come drink with me, 
The liquor law won't injure me, 
Arrah grammachree come drink with me, 
The liquor law won't injure me. 
Two policemen bold, as I've been told, heard Mick was 
selling on the sly, 
So off they went, with full intent to get a 
bottle they did try, 
They went in then, dressed like rag-men, and took a 
seat 
down in the shop, 
Asked Mis. MacGee if so kind she'd be, as to give them a 
bottle, of the real ould drop, 
Arrah grammachree, &c. 
A 
thought struck her then, that she knew the men, and a 
big black bottle she went and got, 
Slie wentintofhe room sayingl'11 be back soon, and she fill-
ed it nicely up with slops, 
I'll let yon see, says Mrs. MacGee, the liquor I 
sell is the 
real ould stock, 
As she filled it right, she corked it tight, and she got two 
dollars for a 
bottle of slops. 
Arrah grammachree, & e. 
'The pdlice in glee ian off do you see, -and stated the case to 
Kennedy, 
Who opened his eyes at cheating the excise, go bring your 
prisonerat once to me, 
You say she did sell, as he took a 
smell, jPhetc] and what 
did you pay for the bottle you got 
Two 
dollars said they, we bad to pay, whyyou foolish men, 
its nothing but.slops, 
Arrah grammachree, ttc. 
The police in dread hung down their heads, when they saw 
nicely they were done, 
Away they went from Kennedy, with the stinking bottle 
they thought was rum, 
And Mick MacGee . and his wife Mary, keep:selling away, 
at the same old . spot, 
And if a 
spy„or a 
policeman comes aroundlshe gives there 
,t bottle of the real -old stock.

AN OLD MANES ADVICE. 
As Sung by Joussy Maims. 
A JOLLY old man of seventy-three, 
Am I 
as plainly you can see, 
As blithe as a 
lark, and brisk as a 
bee, 
No doubt you will think it surprising; 
now I 
manage to carry my years so well, 
As hard as a 
rock and sound as a 
bell, 
It's no secret at all. I 
don't mind if I 
tell, 
It's accomplisli'd by early rising. 
CHORUS. 
Then if you would be wealthy you must always do as I 
do, 
Save a 
penny, spend a 
penny, and a 
penny give, 
And if you would he healthy you must always do as I 
do, 
Take a 
lot of exercise, that's the way to live. ; 
I 
trouble my head with my own affairs, 
I've very few wants and I've very few cares, 
The bloom on my 
face, my life's habit declares, 
I 
always keen steady and sober. 
I 
fig for your Burgundy, Moet, Champagne, 
The brandies of France, and, the vintage of Spain. 
Give me but two things and I 
cannot complain, 
Tliat's a 
pipe and a 
jug of October. 
Then if you, (Pc c.

The merchant may toil from morning till night, 
And turn all to profit that comes to his sight, 
But what is his wealth, if his health isn't right, 
us riches he then will be scorning. 
Perhaps by good living he grows corpulent, 
Then wheh twing'd by the gout, he'll sit diwn to repent 
And wish that his youth in the fields had been spent, 
And he'd breatlfd the fresh air in the morning. 
Then if you, &c. 
The doctor with me ivill never agree, 
It deprives him of practice, and less ns his fee; 
But what is his practice, its nohing to me, 
All potions and pills I

The proof of my maxim it needs no alloy, 
Three things upon earth man shotud care to enjoy, 
health, Plenty, and Peace, I 
believe you, my boy, 
And they're yours if your up in the morning. 
Then if you,

TO an evenin7 party once I 
went and met such a 
nice young 
girl, 
Dressed oh, so fine and smothered in scent, my heart soon fell 
in a 
whirl, 
I 
asked her it she'd dance with me, she looked at me and smiled, 
She wouldn't say yes, she wouldn't say no, she'd quite a

First she would and then she wouldn't, 
Then she smiled and said she couldn't,

Then she said, oh George, you shouldn't,

I 
sat down by the fair one's side and gave her wine and cake, 
told her what I'd do and dare all for her own dear sake, 
She then looked up at me and smiled, I 
took that smile for bliss, 
And when the time for parting came, I 
tried to steal a 
kiss. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, ladies and gentlemen I, came very near doing 
It too, but she was one of those peculiar souls that—

asked what she meant, she thought 
that— 
First she, ctc. 
Well after that we married were, and live pretty nice at home, 
There's one thing which my wife objects that's when I 
wish to

She says that home's the proper place for all good married

Oh where shall I

troubles me most, 
rrom morning till night, I'm dying with fright, for I 
fancy 
I

Cnonns, 
It's terrible bad, to feel so sad, ray senses suffer the most, 
Wherever I 
go, it's true you know, I 
fancy I

ghost. 
The cause of my woe, you soon shall know, I, a 
lovely 
maid did woo, 
She gave me her hand, but understand, another chap loved 
her too, 
This silly young elf, he settled himself when he found that 
she was my wife, 
But before he died, he loudly cried, I'll haunt you all your 
life. 
It's terrible bad, &e. 
Whene`er I 
go out, he's always about, wherever I 
may be, 
If I 
enter a 
train I 
see him quite plain, seated not far from 
me, 
If I 
sit down to dine with a 
friend of mine, or rise to pro-
pose a 
toast, 
I'm certain to stop and the glass I 
drop, for then I 
see the 
ghost. 
It's terrible bad, tte.

THE OLD KITCHEN FLOOR. 
Stag by ED. BURTON. 
FAR back in my musings my thoughts have been cast, 
To the cot where the hours of my childhood were passed; 
I 
loved all its rooms, the pantry and hall, 
But that blest old kitchen was dearer than all. 
Its chairs and its table, none brighter could be, 
For all its surroundings were sacred to me; 
To the nail in the ceiling, the latch on the door, 
And I 
loved every crack in that old kitchen floor. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the old kitchen floor, the old kitchen floor, 
How dear to my heart is the old kitchen floor. 
I 
remember the fire-place, with mouth high and wide, 
The old-fashioned oven that stood by its side, 
Out of which, each Thanksgiving, came puddings and pies, 
That fairly bewildered and dazzled my eyes; 
And then, too, St. Nicholas slyly and still 
Came down every Christmas our stockings to fill; 
But the dearest memories I've laid up in store, 
Is the mother that trod on that old kitchen floor 
Oh, the old, &c. 
Day in and day out, and from morning till night, 
Her foot-steps were busy, her heart always light, 
For it seemed to me then that she knew not a 
care, 
The smile was so gentle her face used to wear; 
I 
remember with pleasure what joy filled our eyes, 
When she told us the stories that children so prize; 
They were new every night though we heard them before 
From her lips at the wheel on the old kitchen floor. 
Oh, the old, &c, 
To night these old visions come back at their will 
But thewheel and its music forever are still; 
The band is moth-eaten, the wheel laid away, 
And the fingers that turned it lie moldering to clay; 
The hearth-stone, so sacred, is just as ' twas then, 
And the voices of children ring out there again; 
The sun through the window looks in as of yore, 
But it sees stranger feet on the old kitchen floor. 
I 
ask not for honor, but this I 
would crave, 
That when the lips speaking are close6 in the grave, 
Oh, the old,&e. 
My children will gather their own at their side, 
And tell of their mother who long ago died; 
'Twould be more enduring, far dearer to me, 
Than inscription on marble or granite could be, 
To have them tell often as I 
did of yore, 
Of the mother who trod on the old kitchen floor, 
Oh, the old,&c.

PAT WON'T GO HOME TILL MORNING. 
Composed and sung by J. IT. RYAN, novv performing with Merchant's 
Panorama of Ireland, as " Rory the Rover.' 
THE dawn upon the hill was breaking, the stars were twinkling 
in the sky, 
As Pat upon the ground lay dreaming, his big shillelah lay close 
by, 
All night the whiskey he's been drinking, and now he wakens 
from his drunken snore, 
lie calls for drink to make him frisky, and swears because there 
is no more. 
CHORUS. 
Then fill up the bowl, hurrah! for a 
thirsty soul, ha I 
ha 
Aft night on.a spree, my boys, my throat with fire is burning, 
Dance so blithe and gay,hurrah! none like Pat can be, ha! ha! 
Divil a 
hair I 
care, my boys, we won't go home till morning. 
The moon upon the bogs was gleaming, and the lambs were 
bleating in the shed, 
The pigs and sows the swill are raking, and the gossons waiting 
to be fed, 
Pat home from the wake is trudging slowly, with divil a 
farth-
ing in his purse, 
Besides his pockets are both holey, and credit to poor Pat not 
worth a 
curse. 
Then fill up, &c. 
The night and fun again advances, and the song and dance 
again goes 'round, 
And Pat again is nimbly drinking, until with whiskey he gets 
drowned, 
Nil night he's been swigging at the bottle, and now he tumbles 
flat upon the floor. 
!et still the boys and girls are dancing, but Pat's asleep tc., 
dance no more. 
Then fill up, &C. 
Of Course It's No Business of Mine. 
Written and sung by HARRY EYE, the Successful English Comic. 
SOME people they say that I'm curious, and tell me I 
never refuse, 
No matter from whence I 
obtain it, in getting the latest of 
news. 
Well, I 
certainly own that I 
do so, and therein is no harm 
I 
opine, 
Whatever I 
hear I 
keep close, for of course it's no business 
of mine. [ Repeat.] 
For instance, at Mrs. Montgomery's, a 
gent with a 
big black 
moustache, 
Calls there most every evening, and for Mrs. Montgomery 
does asW. 
He stays till half- past eight o'clock; Montgomery gets 
home about nine, 
Now I'd like to know what he does there, but of course it's 
no business of mine. [Repeat.] 
Now, I 
met young Miss Smith 'tother ev'ning, she was 
taking a 
nice country walk, 
And as soon as she spied me she did commence for to have 
a 
long talk, 
All about her dear little nephew who, she says, is between 
eight and nine, 
Some say that it isn't her nephew, but of course it's no hue. 
mess of mine. [ Repeat.] 
18 
At Mrs. Fitzgibbons, the baker's, the people are raising a 
din, 
They say that she won't pry her rent, so the sheriff and 
auctioneer s i 
n— 
I 
can't tell what she does w;th her money, though his nose 
like a 
lighthouse doeD shine, 
Some say that she spends it for whiskey, but of course it's 
no business of mine. (Repeat, 
Perhaps the song you have just heard, you do not think is 
worthy of praise, 
On the safe side my friends I 
have erred, for a 
laugh I 
have 
but tried to raise. 
If you're pleased I 
will sing you another if you call on me 
some other time, 
If not pleased my advice to you i, of course, it's no busi-
ness of mine. (Repeat ] 
NOT SO EASY TO DO. 
IT'S all very well for people to tell the course that they mean to 
put sue 
There are many things easy to talk about, but they're not so 
easy to do. 
I've heard many a 
speech that a 
mile would reach, 
But strange to relate up to this very date such people do noth-
ing but talk. 
Words are but wind very often we find, and I 
think you'll agree 
it is true, 
There are many things easy to talk about, but they're not so 
easy to do. 
The teetotalers, they have been trying, they say, to rob us of 
hearty good cheer, 
And because they, you see, prefer water and tea, they would 
stop us from drinking our beer, 
Despite their abuse they'll find it no use if they try to close up 
our pubs, 
We've as much right I 
think to a 
smoke and a 
drink as those 
who can stand the big clubs. 
They may chatter for hours with speech-making powers and 
hold temperance hall meetings too, 
But they'll find it is easy to talk about, but it is not so easy to do. 
I 
courted a 
girl, a 
charming young love, a 
beautiful creature di-
. 
vine, 
But a 
rival I 
found who was fast gaining ground, so I 
asked this 
fair girl to be mine; 
Being first in the field Iliad no wish to yield, but she with 
my rival took flight, 
J 
20 
I 
called him a 
scamp, with my girl to decamp, so he sent me a 
challenge to tight; 
My friends said •• go in, you are certain to win," but lie was 
about six feet two, 
And fighting is easy to talk about, but it's not so easy to do. 
I've now got a 
wife and we never have strife for we've tempers 
uncommonly mild; 
The one point on which we disagree is because we're not bless-
ed with a 
child. 
I 
should really like one, say a 
nice little son, but my wife says 
a 
girl is the best; 
And when I 
walk out my friends are about, and they make this 
a 
subject for jest, 
While some I 
have read have too many instead, for they're 
blessed with a 
dozen or two, -
Well, keeping them's easy to talk about but it's not so easy to 
do. 
There are natures so proud that they talk very loud as they to 
great power advancs; 
They mutter and say we are going to decay, and at our posses-
sions they glance, 
When foes they combine 'Us time I 
opine that we should look 
after ourselves, 
And ready will be our sons of the sea to secure any covetous 
elves, 
For ages 'tis known, we have here 1;01,1 our own, although 
we've been threatened a 
few, 
But they know it's so easy to talk about, but it's not so easy to 
do.

That I

SPOKEN.—Yes, I 
can cure head-ache, heart-ache, tooth-ache, 
knee-ache, toe-ache, stomach-ache, in fact I 
can cure anything 
on the face of the earth except my street door knocker and 
night-bell, and they are continually going into convulsions 
something after this style: 
CriorMS. 
Rat-a-tat, rat-a-tat-tat, oh goodness gracious me, what's that? 
Ding-a-ding-ding, ring-a-ding-aing, there's somebody wants the

Quite tired out I 
go to bed, to get some sleep then try to, 
When just as I 
am dozing off my door I 
have to he to; 
"Oh ! doctor, I 
am very sorry you to have to waken, 
But Mrs. Johnson's baby boy is very badly taken. " 
SPOKEN.—Mrs. Johnson's baby boy, poor little fellow, now 
you go home and give him, well, let me see, give him a 
quart of 
jalap, three pints of ice cream and about a 
half a 
gallon of castor 
22 
oil, give him that hot three times a 
day; if that doesn't cure him, 
well, it'll pretty soon kill him. Well off she goes and as son as 
she's left it starts again. 
Rat-a-tat-tat, &c.. 
No rest I 
get from morn to eve, it's really very shocking, 
My street door too is wearing out by this infernal knocking, 
But what annoys me more than all, as sure as I'm asinner, 
Is that confounded loud rat-tat on Sunday after dinner. 
SPOKEN.—On Sunday after dinner, boys, when me and the 
old woman are quietly sitting down enjoying our port wine and 
peaches — when we can get them—we're suddenly annoyed, 
troubled and bothered, by that confounded loud  
Rat- a- tat-tat, &c.

THE HURDY GURDY LAD, 
I 
DON'T feel very happy, nor I 
don't feel very sad, 
So put me down as middling, although it is too bad ; 
For any girl to serve a 
chap, as lately I've been served, 
But no girl shall take me in again, I'll never take their word, 
A 
girl I 
courted for six months, her Christian name was 
Fanny, 
I 
asked her if she'd have me, and she said she would be 
glad; 
But at present her intention was to stay home with her 
mammy, 
And she could't think of parting with her dear old darling 
dad. 
CTIORUS. 
Yes, she said 'twould break her heart 
To go and leave her mammy, 
She said / twould break her heart, 
To go and leave her dad ; 
But she's run away from both, 
My false, deceitful Fanny, 
And travels about the country, 
With a 
Hurdy Gurdy Lad. 
Now Fanny wasn't handsome, but I 
thought she was sin-
cere, 
And then she had such winning ways, that made me her 
revere, 
But a 
hurdy-gurdy grinder, he used to come our way, 
And for Fanny's recreation, for hours he used to play; 
He'd play awhile, then dance a 
bit, and then he'd sing a 
ditty, 
25 
And I 
often gave a 
penny to the dirty half-grown man, 
He said he was an orphan, that caus d 
me him to pity, 
But I 
never thought he'd cheek enough to run away with 
Fan. 
And as for her, she said, &e. 
Her father and mother were very fond of me, 
And often did invite me my Fanny for to see, 
I 
found her father ' bacca, and I 
found her mother rum, 
And on Fanny I 
invested a 
very tidy sum, 
For Fanny was a 
girl I 
always thought so well of; 
When I 
think how she served me, it my piece of mind de-
stroys, 
Now of Old Mother Cummings I'd often heard tell of, 
But I 
never thought she'd run off with the biggest of her 
boys. 
For she said, eze. 
Now when her father told me that Fan had cut her stick 
I 
felt as if I 
had received a 
blow with half a 
brick, 
For I 
always thought that Fanny, a 
little more pride had, 
Than to travel about the country with a 
hurdy-gurdy lad. 
I 
hear she's got a 
tambourine, and a 
voice that's loud and 
ringing. 
And often in m. wanderings, I 
fancy I 
shall meet, 
This hurdy-gurdy grinder, and Fanny doing the singing, 
Giving a 
morning concert to some children in the street. 
For she said, & c.

SWATE CASTLE GARDEN. 
WHEN I 
landed at Swate Castle Garden, 
I'd just came from the say, 
In my pockets I 
had not a 
farthing, 
As I 
stepped out up the Broadway; 
I 
walked up to a 
lamp-lighter, 
The mystery for to unravel, 
His hair was cut short like a 
fiThter, 
So I 
shouldered my bundle and traveled. 
Cnortus. 
Hurrah for the Stars and the Stripes, 
And the land where we never see fogs, 
If I 
hadn't come here by the pipes, 
rd been digging up turf in the bogs. 
Shure the road it was dirty and sloppy, 
Until I 
came to a 
street called Wall, 
A 
blackguard shouted, there goes a 
Croppy, 
Whin I 
kim to the big City Hall, 
I 
axed a 
Dutch barber the way; 
He answered me dunder and blitzen, 
And a 
big old fat Yankee stepped out, 
And made me an American citizen. 
Hurrah for the Stars, &c. 
The first time I 
wint out to Chicago, 
The weather it was very warm. 
The Commissioners axed me if I'd go 
And settle upon a 
nice farm. 
No, says I, I'll go back to New York, 
Where the Politicks they are so pretty, 
Lave your Dutchmen stop here and work, 
But be jahers I'll stick to the city. 
Hurrah for the Stars, loc. 
Bad luck to that villain from Sligo, 
Shure he tould me his name it was Hubbs, 
He sould me a 
card for Chicago, 
Be my soul 'twas an ould Jack of Clubs, 
But I 
musn't indulge in reflections, 
What I've said isn't worthy of note, 
I'll be running for Sheriff next election, 
So step up me brave boys and vote. 
Hurrah for the Stars, ctc.

'TWAS at the town of nate Clogheen, 
That Sergeant Snapp met Paddy Carey; 
A claner bey was never seen_ 
Brisk as a 
bee, light as a 
fairy; 
His brawny shoulders, four feet square, 
His cheeks like thumping red potatoes, 
Hi 3 
legs would make a 
chairman stare! 
And Pat was loved by all the ladies. 
Old and young, grave and sad, 
Deaf and dumb, dull or mad, 
Waddling, twaddling, limping, squinting. 
Light, brisk and airy— 
CHORUS. 
All the sweet faces at Limerick races, 
From Nullinavelt to Magherafelt, 
At Paddy's beautiful name would melt! 
The sowls would cry, and look so shy, 
Oth! Cushiamachree, did you never see 
The jolly boy, the darling joy, the ladies' toy 
N.imble-footed, black-eyed, rosy-cheeked, 
Curly-headed Paddy Carey! 
0, sweet Paddy, beautiful Paddy! 
Nate little, tight little Paddy Carey. 
His heart was made of Irish oak, 
Yet, soft as streams from sweet Killarney, 
His tongue was tipped with a 
bit of the brogue, 
But the deuce a 
bit at all of the blarney. 
Now Sergeant Snapp, so sly and keEn; 
While Pat was coaxing duck-legged Mary. 
A 
shilling slipped so nate and chine, 
By the powers, he ' listed Paddy Carey I

PADDY'S LAND, 
LAND. 
Composed by JOHNNY Pvoacu. 
COME all ye boys from Paddy's land, who are inclined to roam, 
To reap the English harvest so far away from home, 
Be sure you're well provided with comrades bold and true, 
For you have to fight both day and night 'gainst John Bull and 
his crew. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah, my boys for Paddy's land, 
'Tis the land I 
do adore, 
May heaven smile on every child 
That loves that shamrock shore. 
When we left home tot Dublin, the morning it being clear, 
And when we got on board the boat, we gave three hearty cheers, 
Saying: Good-bye, my boys, to that dear old land, we ne'er 
may see it more, 
For we're going to fight both day and night, all for that sham-
rock shore. 
Then hurrah, &c. 
We sailed away from Dublin quay, and ne'er received a 
shock, 
Until we landed in New York, long side of the dock, 
Where thousands of cur countrymen that were all in that town, 
And " Fagh a 
ballagh clear the track !" were the words that 
passed all round. 
Then hurrah, & c. 
Then away we went in merriment to drink bourbon and wine, 
Each lad he gave his favorite toast for the girl he left behind; 
We sat and sang, made the ale- house rinz, despising Erin's foes, 
Or any man that hates the land, where St. Patrick's shamrocis 
grows. 
Then hurrah, &c. 
BOURBON ON THE BRAIN. 
A Parody on "Just Before the Battle Mother.” 
JUST before the battle, mother, [hie] 
I 
was thinking least of you, 
While upon the field we're spreeing, [lilc] 
With the enemy in view. 
Comrades [ hie] drunk around me lying, 
Filled with bitters made by Dod, 
For well they know that on the morrow 
Some will lie drunk on [hie] the sod, 
CIIORUS. 
Farewell, mother, you may never, I 
hie] never 
See me sober home again; 
But, oh ! you'll not forget me, mother, 
If dead with "Bourbon on the brain." 
Oh, I 
long to have, dear mother, 
A 
demijohn sent me from home; [ hie] 
First thing at morn I 
like my bitters, 
Ere to picket post [hie] I 
roam. 
Tell the traitors all around you, 
That [ hie] their cruel deeds, we know 
In every instance, kill our soldiers 
With their stuff called " Kill me slow," 
Farewell, mother, &‘. 
Hark I 
hear the fish-horn sounding, 
'Tis the signal [ hie] for a 
muss; 
May I 
get no bruises, mother; [ hie] 
As I 
join into this fuss. 
Hear the battle-cry of [ hie] Bourbon, 
how it swells upon the air; 
Oh, yes, 
rally round the bottle, 
And get blind drunk [Iiic] while I 
am there. 
Farewell, mother, &c. 
As sung by JOHNNY ROACH. 
0! HAVE you heard the news, my boys, 
That glorious news to-day ; 
Those gallant sons, with pikes and guns, 
Are girding for the fray. 
The exiles are returning, 
Their dear old land to see ; 
And you and me, must ready be, 
To strike for liberty. 
CHORUS. 
We'll tear that British banner down, 
And we'll every foe destroy ; 
Till we trample in the bloody dust 
Of an Irish Fontenoy. 
The green flag shall wave over us, 
As it did in days of yore ; 
And the dear old harp of Tara's Hall, 
Shall strike its chords once more. 
And the tune we'll play, shall be Patrick's day 
And we'll play it o'er and o'er, 
And soon you'll see, old Ireland free, 
And the exiles home once more. 
We ..! tear, & c. 
We have begged of England long, my boys, 
But now we'll beg no more; 
No more like prowling hounds we'll crawl, 
Around our master's door. 
We have learned the way to freedom, boys, 
And soon we'll strike the blow ; 
That will raise up poor old Ireland, 
And lay the tyrant low. 
We'll tear, &e. 
THE IRISH BOY'S LAMENT. 
Written and sung by JOHNNY ROACH, the successful Irish Vocalist. 
FAREWELL, Ireland, I 
can no longer dwell at home, I 
must 
cross the stormy main, 
Where cruk.1 strife may end my life, to see you ne'er again, 
It will break my heart from you to part, astore acushala machrae. 
But I 
must go full of grief and woe, to the shores of America. 
CITORITS. 
So now farewell, I 
can no longer dwell 
At home, aeushala machree, 
But I 
must go, full of grief and woe, 
To the shores of America. 
On the Irish soil my fathers lived since the days of Erin Banoo, 
They paid their rent and lived content, convenient to Killdew, 
But a 
landlord cruel gave us the shuel, my poor old mother and 
me, 
We had to leave our home, far away to roam, and come to 
America. 
So now, &c. 
No more in the old churchyard, astore, on ray father's grave 
shall I 
kneel, 
But the tyrant knows, but little of the woes, that a 
poor boy 
has to feel; 
110 
36 
When I 
look around, on that little spot of ground, where the 
cabin used to be, 
I 
could curse the laws, that gave me cause to come to America. 
So now, & c. 
Oh, where are the neighbors, kind and true, that was once our 
country's pride, 
No more they are seen, at the fair on the green, or the dance 
by the green hill side. 
'Tis a 
stranger's cow, that is grazing now, where the cabin 
used to be 
With notice they were served to be turned out and starved, or 
come to America. 
So now, & c. 
Oh, Erin Machree, must your children be exiled all over the 
earth, 
Must they think no more of you, astore, of the land that gave 
them birth, 
Must the Irish yield, like the beasts of the field; no, no, acush-
ala machree, 
They are going away in ships, with vengeance on their lips, to 
return to America. 
So now, &c. 
37 
A 
BIT OF MY MIND. 
As sung by EDDIE NORWOOD. 
not of a 
quarrelsome nature at all, 
But a 
peaceable sort of a 
man, 
And I 
always avoid a 
dispute or a 
brawl, 
That's to say if I 
possibly can. 
Still if people behave in an insolent way, 
Or to argue or fight are inclined, 
Why I 
first listen calmly to all they've to say, 
Then I 
give them a 
bit of my mind.. 
CIIORUS. 
A 
bit of my mind, a 
bit of my mind., 
If friends or relations should e'er prove unkind, 
You cannot conceive the relief that I 
find, 
if I'm able to give them a 
bit of my mind. 
When a 
wild little urchin, of seven years old, 
I 
was under a 
pedagogue's rule, 
And the first time I 
got into trouble, I'm told, 
Was for smashing a 
window at school; 
I 
was promised the cane, as a 
matter of course, 
Which I 
told them was not very kind, 
But I 
didn't much care tho' they flogged me by force, 
For I 
gave them a 
bit of my mind. 
A 
bit of my mind, &c. 
7111FW" 
I 
3s 
I've been sadly deceived by my intimate friend, 
Though I 
have treated him just like a 
prince; 
For lie took all the cash I 
could manage to lend, 
And I've never set eyes on him since; 
Still I 
wrote him a 
letter, indignant and strong, 
Fall of all the bad names I 
could find, 
And it pleas'd me to think, tho' his conduct was wrong-, 
That I 
gave him a 
bit of my mind. 
A 
bit of my- mind, &c. 
So- if ever I'm injured, or treated amiss, 
My behavior is always the same,. 
And I've one satisfaction at least, which is this, 
That I 
don't think I'm greatly to blame. 
If my wife should elope with a 
rival to- day, 
(Though I 
might not at first be resign'd), 
I 
should feel myself better, " I'm happy to- say,"* 
If I 'gave them a 
bit of my mind. 
A 
bit of my mind,. & c..

I've flirted down to Long Branch to Newport I

To -Saratoga, R ,ckaway and to Rome; 
I've seen society in every shape and form, 
I've watched the tide of fashions rise and fall; 
I've viewed it sin its calm, Fve seen it in its storm, 
And this is my conclusion after all.

hi such society there's nmeh variety, 
But nothing-ecivals New York society.

It dabbles in the . water or perhaps -upon the shore, 
It yawns and wishes it wasback in town, 
And though it may lie nice to drink the nasty waters, 
And lose your money gambling,at the Spa, 
And meet the sort of men you'd cm, at any place, 
The New York season I 
prefer by far. 
Baden Baden Spa, cte. 
society I've met with in old Ireland, mid the bogs, 
In Paris -ever gay, in London every day, 
in Mount St. Bernard ccnvent, with the monks and jolly dogs,. 
At evrry place I 
think that I 
may-say, 
But there's a

You'll hear theta from every tongue; 
Wherever you go you'll find that it's so,

While the boys .n

Oh, how they do shout, the latest one out,

One day driven mad with a

Why &la% you say so before

IIERCENARY JANE, 
cr Roast Pork, Boiled Pork. 
As swag by W. Hanna- EVE, England's Great Comic. 
I 
WAS at a 
first-class eating house, not far from Maiden 
Lane, 
I 
used to dine and gaze upon the charming waitress, Jane, 
Such eyes, such teeth, such rosy cheeks, I'd never seen 
before, 
I 
never noticed what I'd eat, until I 
paid the score. 
SPOKEN.—And when I 
asked her what I 
owed, she'd say, 
in a 
most bewitching manner, well, let me see, what did you 
have ? there was— 
CHORUS. 
Roast pork, boiled pork, pickled eels, and treacle tart, 
Suet pudding, sheens head, a 
glass of sherry wine, 
Steak pie, pig's feet, saveloys, and bullock's heart, 
Together with the waiter makes a 
dollar forty-nine. 
I 
gazed on her, I 
squeezed her hand, the pressure was re-
turned, 
Oh joy, to think the flame of love within her bosom burned 
I 
used to go there every day, to gaze upon my dear, 
She'd steal a 
wicked glance at me, and whisper in my ear— 
Roast pork, boiled pork, & c. 
I 
met her out at night and used to take her to the play, 
She ruined my digestion ere she named the happy day, 
I 
said, oh Jane, my pretty Jane, my pet, my turtle dove, 
Come dwell with me by rippling streams, and learn to live 
on love. 
SPOKEN.—Live on love, she said, oh not for Jane, she 
prefers something more substantial, such as— 
Roast pork, boiled pork, &c.

CRIME, 
Sung with great sucees3 by JOHNNY ROAM. 
Music pubfishea by WH ITE tTt GOULLAUD. Boston, Mass. 
I'VE been thinking of late, I've been thinking, 
My thoughts I 
can scarcely define, 
I've been thinking why people can wonder, 
At this terrible increase of crime; 
Cries, Old Uncle Sam it's a " poser," 
There's a 
something I 
can't understand, 
I 
would just give a 
trifle to know, sir, 
Why crime should increase in our land. 
I'm sure that we've plenty of gold, sir, 
Our banks are as full as can hold, sir, 
We could buy the whole world I 
am told, sir, 
Yet still, there's an increase of crime. 
, 
It's true what you say, Uncle Samuel, 
We've plenty of gold laid away, 
Mouldy with mildew and rust, sir, 
Guarded by night and by day; 
While you, like a 
dog in the manger, 
Your gold to yourself you confine, 
When a 
little would make a 
great change, sir, 
In this terrible increase of crime. 
For expenses you don't care a 
groat, air, 
Politicians, you feed a 
whole lot, sir, 
While the poor man, with hunger may rot, sir, 
And still you wonder at crime. 
I 
am sure you will own Uncle Sam, sir, 
Temptation is hard to resist, 
Just look at our poor working girl, sir, 
Striving her best to exist; 
Can you wonder at weak constitutions, 
When blood-sucking firms, barely give, 
Enough to keep off destitution, 
A girl, though she's poor, she must live. 
There's our poor needle girl, God defend ber, 
With feelings as proud ;Ind as tender, 
As your proud city lady, remember, 
Uncle Sam can you wonder at crime. 
Can you wonder at crime can you wonder, 
When you see the police on his beat, 
Arresting a 
poor starving man, sir, 
For begging his bread on the street; 
While the thief on the corner stands grinning, 
In the broad open light of the day, 
Your pockets he'd pick for a 
shilling, 
And the law cannot touch him:they say. 
Ile smiles with contempt and derision, 
He defies a 
whole police division, 
While the poor man is sent off to prison, 
And still you wonder at crime. 
Just think while your drinking your wine, sir, 
How the poor of our land they are fed, 
While you, with your rich folks can dine, sir, 
'Tis a 
god-send for them to get bread; 
Go visit the home of the poor, sir, 
Such sights you will never behold, 
To our prisons then go and explore, sir, 
And scatter your hoardings of gold. 
A 
little would soon break asunder, 
The chains the poor sufferer is under, 
Go, list to that great voice of hunger, 
And you'll never more wonder at crime.

PERHAPS SHE'S ON THE RAILWAY. 
BEHOLD in me a 
wretched man, quite broken down by 
woe, 
I've lost my wife and cant.ot, find her anywhere I 
go; 
At finit she robbed me of my heart and new she's flown 
from me, 
And takeu all my furniture, wherever can she be? 
Cnon-us. 
Perhaps she's on the railway, with a 
swell so fair,— 
Perhaps she's up in a 
balloon, flying thro' the air; 
Perhaps she's dead, perhaps alive, perhaps she's on the sett; 
Perhaps she's gone to Brigham Young, a 
Mormonite to be. 
She read so much of Morrnonites, of nothing else she'd talk, 
And with a 
sanztified young chap each day she used to 
walk ; 
She said lie -was a 
Mormon saint from far across the sca, 
I 
have not seen her for a 
week, wherever can she be ? 
Perhaps she's, &c. 
She can't respect the marriage vows, that faithfully she 
swore, 
I 
only hope her Mormon spouse has fifty wives or more; 
I 
hope he'll thrash her every night when , he comes home 
to tea, 
I 
hope they'll always row and fight wherever they may be. 
Perhaps she's, &e. 
0,1 
49 
I 
hope she'll have a 
lot of hungry, squalling brats to keep, 
I 
hope they'll cry all night, and never let her go to sleep; 
I 
hope her chimneys all may smoke, her lodgers never pay, 
And German bands and organ men annoy her all the day. 
Perhaps she's, &c. 
If she is in the railway train, I 
hope that it will smash, 
If up in a 
balloon, I 
hope she'll fall out with a 
crash; 
If on the road to Salt Lake, then, I 
hope she may get 
drowned, 
Then I 
will get another wife and quickly I'll be bound. 
Perhaps she's, &c. 
SAUERKRAUT,

THE DEAR LITTLE SHAMROCK, 
THERE'S a 
sweet little spot, away down by Cape Clear, 
Sure, it's Ireland herself, to all Irishmen dear; 
Where the white praties blossom like illigant flowers, 
And the wild birds sing sweetly above the round towers; 
And the dear little Shamrock that none can withstand, 
Is the beautiful Emblem of Old Ireland, 
In his hat, good St. Patrick used always to wear; 
The Shamrock, whenever he went to a 
fair; 
And Nebuchadnezzar, no doubt highly prized 
A 
bit of the blossom when he went disguised; 
For, the bosom of beauty itself might expand, 
When bedecked by the Shamrock of Old Irelana. 
When far, far away, a 
sweet blossom I've seen, 
I've dreamt of Shillelaghs and Shamrocks so green; 
That grow, like two twins, on the bogs and the hills, 
With a 
drop in my eye, that with joy my heart fills; 
And Iv'e blessed the dear sod from a 
far distant strand, 
And the beautiful Shamrock of Old Ireland.

THE GOAT. 
NOW my dear friends, I 
m 
going to relate, 
If you pay attention, you've not long to wait; 
My father lived in a 
place called Gramote, 
He had a 
sow, and a 
cow, and a 
fine billy goat. 
This goat, sure, he had a 
queer, curious way, 
He'd go out every morning and stop out all day; 
Whan he'd come home at night, like a 
bull he would roar, 
'Till my father gets up for to open the door. 
One day we sat down, and was going to ate, 
The goat leap'd on the table and sthole all the mate, 
And without saying a 
word, shure the dirty ould 
He druv his two horns in me poor father's stomach. 
Says me mother to me, " Jamsey," " Yis inam," says I, 
" 
Take that goat to the market, and sell him, now thry." 
The words she scarce spoke, when the pat, gave a 
jump, 
And sthruck me mother, oh gorra 
such a 
murthering thump. 
Then all the house bate a 
hasty retrate, 
And the goat backed away at the divil's own rate; 
He spied my father's coat hanging, he gave a 
loud bawl, 
Made a 
charge on the " frize," and druv his head in the wall. 
some time afther they went to look for the goat, 
They searched all around, ' till they came to the coat. 
All of the goat that was left on the very .,ext day, 
Was only the sthump ot his tail, and it still bucking away.

PAT ROACH AT THE PLAY, 
Music of this song can,be obtained of E. 
II. 
HARDING, 288 Bowery. 
AS Pat Roach and the missus irom Galway, 
In Dublin once happened to be, 
To the playhouse they went one fine evening, 
Determined diversion to see; 
But says Pat as he entered there's no one, 
Pay here," cried a 
voice, " holy murther," 
Says Pat, " there's a 
man in the wall." 
" 
Pay here," cries a 
voice, " holy murther," 
Says Pat, " there's a 
man in the wall." 
The missus she looked all around her, 
In wonder her eyes they did roll, 
But says she " Paddy darling, alanna, 
He is here like a 
rat in a 
hole, 
Pay here, how much is it ? a 
shilling; 
A 
shilling apiece, that won't do, 
'Tis too much, Mister Pay here avourneen, 
Eighteen pince I 
will give you for two, 
'Tis too much, Mister Pay here avourneen, 
E.ghteen pince I 
will give you for two. 
Pat grumbled but paid and got seated, 
The band was beginning to play, 
He j 
igg'd on his seat quite elated, 
And to the musicians did say, 
"'Tis yer selves that can do it, me bouchals, 
And I 
wish to ye's wid all my mind, 
To the fiddlers more power to your elbows, 
Mister bugler, Heav'n spare ye, yer wind. 
To the fiddlers more power to your elbows, 
Mister bugler, Heav'n spare ye, yer wind. 
The play then went on, and Pat wondered, 
And sat with his mouth open wide, 
As the proud haughty Lord of the Manor, 
Sought to make the fair maiden his bride; 
"To the mountains," says he, " I 
will bear thee," 
She shrieked as the saw him approach, 
" 
Is there no one at hand now to save me?" 
Shouts a 
voice, " yis, me darl in, Pat Roach." 
Then up on the seat, jumped brave Paddy. 
Says he, " now you blackguard, be gone, 
Or a 
lord though you be, tin times over, 
I'll knock your two eyes into one:— 
" 
Sit down there in front!" " what you spalpeen," 
Is it me you thus dar to addriss, 
De ye think that Pat Roach would sit aisy, 
And see that poor girl in distress? 
A 
scuffle ensued in a 
minute, 
But soon sure the row did subside. 
And as 
at gasped for breath he discovered, 
Of the door he was on the wrong side; 
He soon found the missus, next morning 
They started for home, and Pat swore, 
If he once safely landed in Galway, 
He'd come up to Dublin no more. 
THE WEEPIN1 WILLER. 
DOWN by the country side, 
Lives Old Gray, the miller, 
Down by the side of the mill-stream tide, 
Grows a 
weepin' 
Under the wilier tree, 
Sat the miller's daughter, 
Shagin' a 
song and gazin' long, 
Into the bublin' water—Liquid, 
CHORUS. 
She sat by the side of the bublin' water, 
Under the weepin' wilier tree, 
Tears fell from her eyes, 
Hands she was a 
wringin', 
First she cries, and then she sighs, 
And then commene'd a 
singin'— 
"All the world's a 
waste, 
Life to me is o-jus, 
Since William he deserted me, 
And went and joined the sojers"—Army. 
She sat, &e. 
Then from her bosom she drew, 
A 
piece of needle cover, 
And on it wrote a 
very short note. 
To her deceitful lover, 
" 
Take this to William Phipps, 
Straight to him be tellin' 
WAIL -40,11.6..." 
56 
Itis Susan died thro' suicide--
P. S.—Please excuse bad spelling—Orthography,'I 
She sat, (17c. 
She look'd at the thimble case, 
Which "William false had bought her, 
She look'd to the right, she look'd to the left, 
And then look'cl into the water ; 
Then she did prepare, 
Her mortal life to injure, 
Her head was bare and the color of her hair 
Was a 
sort of delicate ginger—Auburn. 
She sat, tke. 
She looked at the wilier above, 
And said, "I'll hang in my garter, 
But what a 
mistake if the garter break, 
I 
shall be drown'd in the water." 
She look'cl at the water below, 
And her nerves began to totter— 
"I'm not very bold, and I 
may take cold, 
I'll wait 'till the weather is hotter "—nit7der 
She sat, tke. 
JERSEY SAM. 
OH! I 
was born in Jersey, 
And of that I'm going to sing; 
And yet it seems but yesterday, 
For time is on the wing. 
I 
went way down to New Orleans; 
And there I 
fought the foe, 
Along with Hickory Jackson, 
Some Fifty Years ago. 
CHORUS. 
For I 
am one of the olden time, 
And may be thought too gay, 
But I'm Jersey Sam, the Farmer's Man, 
Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah 
I 
bear the name of Samuel, 
Though some, they call me Sam, 
And through this world I 
rove along, 
As happy as I 
can; 
The world, they say, has been improved 
But I 
should like to know, 
If folks are any better now, 
Than Fifty Years ago, 
For I 
am one, &e. 
— 
r 
When I 
was young, then boys wereboys, 
And went to bed at ten; 
But ncw, when they are twelve :ears old, 
They think that they are men. 
You'll hear them call for rum and beer, 
And smoke cigars heigh-ho! 
What would our parents have thought Of that 
Some Fifty Years ago ? 
For I 
um one, (c7c. 
At midnight, too, one hears young men, 
With husky voices sing, 
That " Champagne CharEe" is their name, 
And they know its no such thing; 
'They go to bed with a 
head-ache, 
At least they tell us so, 
I 
never heard of such a 
tiling, 
Some Fifty Years ago. 
For I 
am one, tke. 
The women of the present time, 
They cannot draw a 
line, 
But wear our hats and jackets, 
And appear quite masculine; 
They wear false hair, for it's the style, 
And call it their own; you know--
But our girls would scorn to wear a 
wig, 
Some Fifty Years ago. 
For I 
am one, &-,
e. 
WHEN THESE OLD CLOTHES WERE NEW 
EIGHT years ago, I 
looked a 
swell, sirs, 
With walking cane, and purse as long, 
I 
quizzed the ladies in the street, sirs, 
Alas, that game did not last long, 
I 
married got, to my m:sfortune, 
From that day every penny flew, 
For soon I 
spent the marriage portion, 
Cn my wedding-day these clothes were nfixe. 
We went to church, so blythe and merry, 
This hat of mine was new and Tight, 
We drank our crusted port and sherry, 
And ev'ry eye was beaming bright. 
But you, poor hat, can tell the hist'ry 
Of where we go and what we do, 
But how you stand it is a 
mysery— 
Think of the days when you were new. 
And you, poor coat, have got quite seedy, 
I 
never cuffed you, speak the truth, 
You cannot say that I 
was greedy, 
I 
filled your pockets, yes, forsooth; 
For ev'ry morning you I 
studied. 
And after dinner open threw, 
And seldom were you skirts e'er muddied, 
I 
kept a 
trap when you were new. 
And you, poor boots, were bright as any, 
You really were a 
lovely pair, 
Cleaning you've cost many a 
penny, 
I 
took you with me errywhere, 
But farewell to the soles departed_ 
For my poor toes they do peep through— 
And you, poor tops, look quite faint-hearted, 
how different now, than you were new. 
And you poor gloves, my hands did shelter, 
Yet still I 
held you in my love, 
We through the world went ' leiter skelter, 
Like true friends, living hand and glove. 
But farewell clothes, we part too soon. 
Then for a 
paupers suit, grey or blue, 
I 
must ale ia a 
poor-law union, 
in clothes I 
hate, though perhaps quite new.

IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
It is a Fac simile of a Trick practiced by all 
the Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Bead what a leading Journal says of it: 
"An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic orcit 
has been sent us, called ' Lamm-
3r Dultyrr,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to giv3 opportunity for a 
decideth f 
puzzling trick. 
While present.ing the ordinary appeK..-
once of a

it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapinly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copie3 of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain =thing bat portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the nemt, only Columbine ; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. 
A little practice, and the clirettions printed 
with the book will make anybody at home in the hand-
ling of it."—Pisikt. Ecening
