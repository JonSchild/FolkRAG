MANY QUESTIONS Go away from me you vulgar youth and let me quiet be. Before one night I would
lie with you you must answer questions three. Answer questions three as I put them up forth to
you, And into bed with you I'll go and slumber next t'the wall. For breakfast you must bring to me
a bird without a bone, For dinner ........ you must bring to me a [?] [cherry/?]without any stones,For
supper you must bring to me a [birdwithout?] any gall. Then into bed with you I'll go and slumber
next t'the wall. Oh when the [chicken?] is in the eggshell then I'm sure there's not a bone. [Cherries?]
in full blossom then I'm sure there's not a stone. The dove soars high, a timid bird, it soars without a
gall. Now into bed with me you'll go and you'll slumber next t'the wall. Now go away from me young
man and be off with your tricks. Before one [night?] I would lie with you, you must answer questions
six. Answer questions six as I put them forth to you, Then into bed with you'll go and slumber next
t'the wall. What is rounder than any ring, what's deeper than the sea? What is worse than woman's
kind, uhat's higher than the [trees?]? What bird sends forth its busy call and from whence do the
dewdrops fall? Then into bed with you'll go and I'll slumber next t'the wall. Well the earth is rounder
then any ring, hell's deeper than the sea, The Devil is worse than women's kind, the skies are higher
than the trees. The lark soars high, a timid bird*, and from heaven the dewdrops fall. Then they
jumped in bed together and they bumped against the wall.
* Should read, The lark sends [forth?] its busy call and from heaven, etc.
