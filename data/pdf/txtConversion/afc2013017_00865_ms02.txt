Introduction. Mary Hoefferle interviewing elementary art teacher Kelsey Lapin 
at McDill Elementary School in Stevens Point, Wisconsin on January 9, 2014. Kelsey read and 
signed release form. 
00:00:28 
Inspiration to choose this career path: Mother and sister are teachers and her 
father had taught as well. She was in school to be an elementary teacher, then decided art 
education was her path. 
00:01:15 
Educational background: Took child development classes in high school. Chose 
UW Oshkosh for education degree. Earned a BFA degree in Art Education – five-year program. 
00:03:34 
This is her first full time, full year of teaching k-6 at three different schools. 
00:03:04 
Typical day/week: Arrives at school at 8:00 am. First class comes in at 9:15. 
Kelsey has a full time aid to assist. Teaches three back-to-back, 45-minute classes, until one-
hour lunch starting at 11:30 – eats and then preps for the four, back-to-back, 45 minute 
afternoon classes. Teaches every grade, every day – seven classes a day. Stops in the office 
each morning to build community, say hello, checks email, collaborates with aid. Tries to eat 
with staff in the lounge – to build community and collaboration. Last class leaves at 3:30. Stays 
at school until 4:30 or 5:00 getting projects graded or displayed in the school. Grades every 
student (nearly 1,000) on every project. Does lesson planning at night. Gets ideas from 
pintrest, on-line. No lesson plans are required from administration. Kelsey explains lessons on 
her blog. One of her three schools is a 25-minute drive.   
00:12:13 
Typical class period: All schools use PBIS (consistent behavior plan across the 
district). Uses a document camera/document camera and PDFs of images she collates to 
show/inspire students. Doesn’t do power points. Asks students lots of questions during 
instruction. 
00:16:18 
Things Kelsey likes about her job: No testing! Hears classroom teachers 
complain about testing. She also loves watching the students grow up. Sees a side of children 
that other teachers don’t. Likes connecting to them through pop culture. Kids draw her 
pictures of rainbows and zebras (her favorites). Some kids find new interests. 
00:18:30 
Difficult aspects of the job: The schedule – no time in between classes to restart 
her brain. If something bad happens in one class, it’s hard to bounce back. Class size is 
problematic, too – has 30 first graders, 30 kindergarteners in one class. She likes the six-day

rotation. The reason the district created this kind of schedule is to provide collaboration time 
for classroom teachers – and many benefits to this collaboration. 5th and 6th graders used to 
have 60 minute art classes and they could do more art, more projects. Avoids more-time 
involved materials like clay and paper mache. 
 
00:23:41 
Relationship with classroom teachers: Connects best with k-2 teachers. One of 
the first grade teachers hangs out with her on the weekends. All teachers except two are 
approachable and understanding. Collaborate on some projects.  
 
00:26:40 
Relationship with administrators: Good connections to female principals. The 
male principal is scary, an ex-Navy Seal. She doesn’t feel as appreciated in that building – only 
one teacher there compliments her students’ work. That school is one of the toughest schools, 
too. She doesn’t take it personally. 
 
00:29:48 
Relationship with other staff: Enjoys the custodians – they are kind of quirky 
and joke around with her. They work hard for the teachers. Since Kelsey has 1,000 students, 
she relies on the secretaries to help with student issues, get keys to the building, get access to 
computer systems. They are the life force of the building. 
 
00:32:02 
Evaluation of her performance: Curriculum was updated in early 90s – so the 
district doesn’t have a curriculum. No consistency across the buildings. Superintendent 
observed informally and was surprised by this fact. She is supposed to be observed three 
times by principals using a Pathwise evaluation tool. Only one formal observation has been 
done. The district will switch to the teacher effectiveness model next year. Only have four art 
teachers for nine schools – they are at the bottom of the totem pole. Students have music and 
phy ed twice a week for 45 minutes each.  
 
00:36:30 
Relationship with other art teachers: Meets with the other three art teachers 
and a curriculum developer for 90 minutes once a month.  
 
00:38:50 
Camaraderie with other teachers, inside jokes, rituals: Shares conversation on 
TV shows with one other teacher. A first grade teacher has a bath tub with pillows in it, so 
Kelsey lays in it when she has a bad day. 
 
00:40:50 
Stereotype of art teacher: They are supposed to be weird and crazy and funny. 
She fits it. She wears bright colors every day. She always has pencils or markers or pens stuck 
in her hair bun. Usually has paint or markers or charcoal on her clothes or skin. Loves rainbows 
and zebras. 
 
00:43:20 
Interactions with parents: Only three showed up for conferences. If any 
troubles with parents, the principal deals with it. Not a ton happens in 45 minutes that 
warrants phone calls home. Sent a newsletter home. Parents donate all kinds of recyclable 
materials. The parents are aware of her presence.

Politics of the job: The superintendent is not very well liked – he’s very 
conservative and old school. Talk about the school board getting rid of him. She doesn’t have 
an opinion on the matter one way or the other. She supports unions. No decisions made about 
pay scale for teacher salaries. She is still on her parents’ health insurance policy. 
 
00:50:14 
Advice for new teachers: Make sure it’s what you truly, truly want to do. Hard 
to get a job. Know that during the school year, you won’t have a life. Don’t take things 
personally. Teachers and students’ compliments make her feel proud of her job. Without 
acknowledgement of her effort, and people’s attitude that she isn’t a real teacher because she 
teaches art – these things make her feel small.
