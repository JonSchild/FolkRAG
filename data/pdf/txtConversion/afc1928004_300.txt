Entered according to Act of Congress in the year 1876, by A. J. 
FISHER, in tile office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
THE FIELDINGS, the eminent Irish Commedians and Vo-
calists, sailed to day for Liverpool, to visit their friend 
Sam Hague, with whom they remain until Wednesday, 
when they start for the 
Stars and Stripes." During that 
short sojourn in Dublin, the public and private worth of 
the Fieldings have endeared them to all who have had the 
pleasure of coming in contact with them. 
The bond of 
affection between Ireland and America is strong as the love 
of a 
true woman ; there is, on both sides of the Atlantic, 
a 
looking forward anti back,—a 
lomring gaz 
yearning 
hope, tint oftentimes bridges the great expanse in flights 
of pleasing fancy 
and when we meet a 
worthy daughter 
or son of " the ould stock,' our hearts warm to them as 
to a 
connecting link between oursclvt.s and those we love 
in that distant land 
how' much more is this so when we 
find genuine talent and high principle challenging our ad 
miration and commanding our respect. 
To alter the 
words of one of sir. Fit ,l,ling's I)eautiful ballads, I 
hope they 
‘• Ne'er will forget u, tho' waves roll between us, 
Ow- image ?nay follow wherever they go ; 
And true to their promise, they'll come o'er the oceai 
Back to the land where the shamrocks do grow.

Gnarerox THEATRE OF VARIETIES. — A 
capital entertain-
ment now occupies the stage of the Grafton Theatre of 
Varieties, which is well attended every evening. 
The per-
formances consist of" singing dancing, & c., and are car-
ried out in excellent style, while, as far as our observation 
goes good order and decorum invariably obtain among 
the audience. 
Amongst the artistes are THE I'rELDisos, 
delineators of Irish ( or perhaps 
we should say Irish 
American character 
Their entertainment, which will be 
fonni novel and attractive, is especially remarkable for one 
thing—the utter absence of all vulgarity and buffoonery. 
This, a. first sight may appear rather faint praise, but 
4 
when one reflects on the idiotic character in which the 
concert-hall Irishman usually appears—whooping, scream-
ing, flourishing a 
bludgeon, and howling out disgusting 
inanities in an accent belonging to no language or patois 
on earth—it is refreshing to be able to point out artistes 
who can be witty, lively, frolicsome, and " funny," with-
out rough horseplay or offensive caricature, 
we do not 
mean to say that the Fieldings reproduce, with accuracy, 
the Irish peasants of the day ; but we are not sorry that 
they do idealize the character, and we gladly welcome the 
refinement which clothes their puns and jokes, and smart 
repartee. 
The sketch in which they appear is clever and 
pleasant : the lady's accent is appropriate and natural— 
we have heard it many a 
time in its native county—and 
the singing is very good. 
It is gratifying to know that 
this new version of Irish character has been thoroughly 
appreciated.—Irish Times. 
Visitors to the Grafton will regret to learn that the now 
celebrated American-Irish comedians, THE FIELDECGS, 
take their leave on Saturday next, and will almost imme-
diately return to New York, having to appear at Tony 
Pastor's Opera House on the 1st proximo. 
On this, their 
first to Ireland, unheralded by blatant trumpet or intru-
sive announcements, Mr. and Mrs. Fielding may well feel 
proud of the success attending their visit, which it is to be 
hoped will be repeated at no distant date. 
Many of our 
native born tronid-be Irish comedians might leare some-
thing from astudy of the style of those trans-atlantic ar-
tistes. 
Mr. George West, the worthy proprietor of the 
Grafton. deserves great credit for his pluck in venturing 
on such a 
heavy engagement in his small but tasteful Hall 
of Varieties. 
Indeed, his company is an immense one at 
present. — Magnet, Dublin, Feb. 1, 1875. 
Mr. George West (now sole proprietor of the Grafton) has 
made a 
great hit in his engagements during the past week. 
The most prominent members of the company at present 
OA* TFIZ FIELDINGS (Irish Comic Vocalists). 
When the 
word " Classic" is used it usually becomes -associated 
our minds with the zone and toga, the draperies and sail.; 
dais of ancient Greece ; it seems absurd to connect the 
word with petticoats of scarlet or hoods of freize, with 
home- spun stockings, frieze body-coats and knee-breeches; 
yet when, even by comparison—we find anything chaste 
and pure, we usually apply the term " Classic ;" so may the 
term be applied to t 
he entertainment given by the Fieldings 
for their style is as far removed from what we are accus-
tomed to applaud, as Irish Comedians, as the toga of Greece 
is removed from the present monstrosities of body coats, 
inexpressibles, and stove-pipe hats ! Their wit is refined 
und elegant, yet perfectly in keeping with the character 
of a 
respectable Irish peasant. 
Their vocalism is of a 
high order, and both possess remarkably good voices. 
A 
novel feature is the singing of two distinct songs at the 
same time, the airs—though totally different—being made 
to harmonise most pleasingly. 
Crowded houses and gen-
uine applause reward the efforts of these really clever ar-
tistes. 
This is their first visit to Ireland, having left 
America only a 
few weeks since, and I 
trust their eirgage-
ments will permit of a 
lengthened stay among us on this 
side of the Atlantic, — Dqb1;n. ErenbT .Mail, Feb. 1, 
1875. 
THE GRAFTON. — The engagement of THE FIELDINGS, 
(the American Irish drietists.) has proved one of the great-
est hits made at this Concert Hall since its opening. 
They have a 
large repertoire, and they certainly hit off the 
peculiarities of the Irish race in a 
manner that has proved 
most satisfactory to the natives. — Era. 
THE CAMBRIDGE,-Mr. Nugent has become of late quite 
distinguished for 
his readiness to 
give artists from 
America opportunities of displaying their talent before 
the visitors to his Hall. 
Last week he introduced a 
pair 
of strangers named John and Maggie Fielding, who were 
deservedly well received. 
The gentleman is tall and good 
looking, and has a 
brisk manner : while the lady is pleas-
ing and smart. 
She personated an Irish lass, who says 
her name is Katey Ginger : and be represented her ad-
mirer, whom she by turns allures and repels. 
They sang 
of being 
The Tipperary Couple," and of going " Off to 
Donnybrook Fair." 
A song expressive of the feelings of 
a 
pair of emigrants, who, after their arrival in the -United. 
,itates eli11 fondly remember • Dear Erin," and a 
humor 
ous effusion in which they discourse concerning their nu-
merous relations and friends, among whom are the, Brien 
and the llyans. were also given by them. 
Mr. Fielding has 
an excellent voice. 
He is also amusingly witty. 
The lady 
::oo. sings well. and is apt at repartee. 
There is a 
frash-
ness and a 
finish about their performances which give 
them a 
speeial character, and are likely to cause them to 
be popular durin .; their stay in London.--- Era.

A_HOt 11 eV illUpOrt alit engagement here is 
ihat of Tian riELDINGS—a pair of duetists among the 
:aany others who have lately faced the briny ocean to gain 
welcome on old England's shore. 
The pristine glory ot 
American artistes in England is yet undoubtedly in em-
bryo, even as it has been proved to be with English talent 
visiting the cities of the " Free West. - But when an interim 
ional form of taste has been established,it's beyond the pos-
sibility of uncertainty that the representatives of amuse-
ment, of the mother country and of America, will perform 
in each other's nati've land with a 
success according to 
individual incrIt. 
The rieldings are American artistes, 
Introducing the Irish sta:la ( wt. busitass in a 
highly-refined 
style. 
They are exceedingly versatile, and the lady pos-
sesses a 
splenlid voice. 
Their impersonation sketch of 
the cook of a 
lion ehold who suddenly becomes possessed 
of a 
large lortune and a 
chambermaid, who is in love 
with him, calls forth much applause. 
When we were 
present they also sang the sweet plaintive ballad, " Erin, 
shall we see the no more ?'• gaining lond and enthusiastic 
applause.

As sung by the FIELDINGS. 
There's an emblem so dear to American hearts 
Floating over the land that is free, 
since the Goddess of Liberty's cradle was rocked 
On the shores of the Isle of the Sea. 
With a 
dark field of blue and a 
bright stripe of red. 
Bespangled with stars bright as gold— 
A 
Centennial present from brave hearts now still— 
This " banner a 
hundred years old." 
CHOHUS. 
God bless our Centennial meeting at home ! 
May joys and sweet pleasures untold, 
Cluster round the dear emblem our forefathers gave, 
This " banner a 
hundred years old." 
And when Liberty, crushed by the grim tyrant's hand. 
Lay panting and bleeding alone, 
Ere the brave hearts had rallied around our dear land, 
And had offer'd their blood to atone. 
And the Angel of love, looking down front above, 
Dropped tears on tlfe blue ocean cold, 
And plashing that flag, they enfignred each star 
On this " banner a 
hundred years old." 
CHORUS. 
God bless our Centennial meeting at home ! 
May joys and sweet pleasures untold. 
Cluster round the dear emblem our forefathers gave,

'Twas on the Fourth of last July, 
This is the truth and not a 
lie, 
That Dan McGowan and Mary Maloye, 
In wedlock were united ; 
And as they had some cash on hand. 
Says Dan, our w edding will be grand; 
More power to you, says Mary Ann. 
Now who shall be invited: 
The Clanceys, Fagius. and the Doyle, 
Murphys, Dugins, and the Gores, 
Whalen, Hagen, and Paddy Miles, 
The Bolivers, and a 
hundred more. 
'Pon me word. the President's Ball. 
Or a 
fair at i 
onigall! 
Finnigan's wake was nothing at all 
Compared to this wedding. 
Music playirg, whiskey dying, 
Boys and girls with love a 
dying— 
Children in the corners crying— 
At McGowan's wedding. 
Some were playing forty-fives— 
More of them were snaking dice— 
And the girls were making pies ; 
The bride was telling stories. 
Some were smoking their dudheens, 
And boys a 
hugging their Colleens ; 
More were eating Pig's crureens; 
sure all were in their glory. 
Fiddlers playing jigs and reels— 
I 
tell you they were a 
happy lot— 
Until the whiskey made them squeal— 
That was the time that things got hot! 
CHOEU8. 
Melah, murder, what a 
timi 
Did'ut we see them cut a 
seine: 
Drinking whiskey, sometimes wine. 
And on the the lunch a 
raiding; 
Hugging, squeezing one another— 
Children crying for their mother— 
All mix'd up— this way and 'tother— 
At McGowan's wedding.

I'm a 
foreigner, that you can see. 
So there's no use in telling ye's that ; 
The place that I 
came is far o'er the main. 
Where every one is known as Pat! 
Now my brogue to you may seem strange— 
It has such a 
perculiar treany 
But the accent is sweet and the movements is nate 
Of a 
North of Ireland man. 
I'm a 
North of Ireland man 
And me name it is Roger McMann 
The style of me brogues, 
And the cut of me clothes, 
Shows I'm a

When I 
first struck this beautiful place. 
How the boys did of me make game. 
Some said Pipe his Gob and more, stab nobs! 
Faith, I 
thought they were all insaitP : 
But I 
was not many months here. 
Until I 
took a

Now I'm bully at Cheesing it Culley—

E'er echo',s to the billows' roar,

UP ANOTHER STREET. 
/3Y THE FIELDINGS. 
Now I'm often taken for a 
flat ; 
But yet how very strange. 
How soon they all discover 
They've pulled on the wrong reins ! 
For instance, when I 
meet sonic friends, 
For drinks, a 
round I-11 pay ; 
But when it comes to five or six. 
I 
turn to them and say— 
CHORUS. 
That's up another street 
And out of my direction; 
Realty, I'm sorry, 
But it's out of my beat 
Of course, I'd oblige you. 
But after some reflection, 
I've conic to the conclusion, 
That it's up another street. 
I 
once did love a 
charming girl, 
And told her so, one night ; 
When she declared she loved me too ; 
Then asked me if I'd write 
My name to an Agreement, 
Promising that her ra wed ; 
But thinking what it might cost me, 
I 
bowed to her and said— 
That's up another street, A:c. 
In various ways, a 
victim 
I 
have very nearly been : 
But just at the last moment, 
I, through every dodge have seen. 
So really, now. I 
must be off, 
So don't press me to stay 
To sing again, or if you do, 
Then I 
will have to say— 
That's up another street, &c. 
KEEP OFF THE GRASS.

Mm—Pull Down the Brinc18. 
The other day, just for a 
spree. 
A 
sudden thought came over me 
To go for a 
walk through Central Park, 
To view the dear girls and have a 
lark, 
In my pocket I 
had dollars, just three— 
So off to the l'ark I 
started with glee. 
As I 
went through the gate a 
police I 
did pass, 
Who whispered, Young man, please keep off the grass.

I 
can see you are out for a 
bit of a

Please stand aside and let the Ladies pass ; 
Now mind what I 
tell you, please keep off the grass. 
I 
had not got far when I 
thought I 
should die— 
An object I 
saw that took my eye ; 
A. handsome young damsel dressed up so gay. 
I 
took off my hat and asked her to stay ; 
To which she consented, with such a 
sweet smile— 
Then did'ut I 
on the agonies pile. 
I 
asked her, of wine would she take a 
glass ! 
She said, Sir, with pleasure, but—keep off the grass 
offered her my arm, she agreed to my wish. 
We spoke of the ducks, likewise the fish; 
And when I 
talked of marriage, she blushe,I and said 
I'm just twenty-one, and anxious to wed 1 
She gave me this Rose, and called me her dear 
We got through the Park, a 
Hotel was pear— 
l. ordered Champagne—it was really first-class ; 
When I 
asked for a 
kiss, she said—keep off the grass! 
It was getting late, I 
could no longer stay, 
So we had to part—but to meet the next day; 
Months had passed by, but to meet her I 
failed— 
When for breach of promise I 
found myself in jail ! 
When I 
was tried, the Judges said, young swell'

010 morn when thinking o'er events, 
In our Central Park so great, 
Oa a 
rustic bench I 
sat, 
O'er things to ruminate ; 
When sleep o'ereame me for a 
time, 
A & use mist did arise : 
X 
panorama of strange forms 
ad pass before my eyes ! 
I 
r 
used aloft my wond'ring gaze, 
It SitHile- t 
0 
pierce the clouds. 
As by me pvis'd. in stram!e array, 
A. grelt an ,1 
bustling crowd. 
iiitied caeli familiar face. 
And marked each stirring scene, 
Ti ,e 
record of a 
hundred years— 
I 
saw them in my dream. 
fog to me it cleared away, 
There came a 
brilliant light, 
Anti us a 
Keystone to the Arch 
The; c 
shone a 
rainbow bright ! 
And in the centre Freedom stood, 
Aloft - she rais'd her hand---
And ppint,l, a--; they pass'd me by, 
, 
tile patriot band ! 
I 
saw the men ce Boston march, 
So noiseless to the Sea. 
To strike the Keynote of our fame., 
And overthrow the tea 
And tlien I 
saw them swiftly go 
To Concord's distant town, 
Where low the Union Jack did droop, 
liv F:eedom's sons cast down. 
I 
next saw Lafayette embark 
To cross the raging main ; 
Saw Warren lying stark and stiff, 
When in the battle slain ; 
Saw Putnam ride his gallant steed 
Way down those stairs, so swift. 
And Washington upon the ice 
Of Delaware, adrift 
next did see our gallant boys 
In Valley Forge, forlorn ; 
And still their hearts with patriot tire 
Defied the wintry storm; 
Then came upon my vision 
A 
dark cloud in the sky— 
It was the traitor, Arnold. 
That in shame was passing by. 
A 
ray of light the cloud dispelled, 
As Paulding glided by 
With Major Andre in his grasp, 
As he went forth to die ! 
Saw Jefferson the paper write. 
Which made us slaves no more I 
Our glorious Constitution, boys! 
As wrote in days of yore : 
Saw Lincoln sign the Freedom 
Of all men throughout the land! 
And Ethan Allen take the Fort, 
By Lake Champlaine does stand ; 
Saw Jackson with his cotton bales, 
Defy the invading foe ; 
And Taylor hold our banner up 
Way down in Mexico. 
But at this moment i 
awoke, 
As loud a 
bell did ring, 
And saw unto the breeze our Flag 
Its graceful emblem fling ! 
I 
saw old Independence Ball, 
So bright in the sun's ray, 
As Hancock to the people spoke. 
" 'Tis our Centennial Day !" 
t'ind all the spirits of my dream 
Did join in joyful cry— 
This is the year of Seventy-Six— 
The Fourth day of July ! 
And sweet Columbia, far above, 
She pointed down with pride 
Unto our Flag. and proudly said--
" 
It has the world defied I" 
OR " TIMOTHY TOTTLE."

Now I've been out with some pals to dine, 
Beautiful dinner and glorious wine, 
They all drank their share. and I've got mine, 
So now I'm rolling home. 
1 
he reason why I'm inclined to roll, 
The wine has got up into my old pell, 
I 
can't walk straight upon my soul, 
For my legs are inclined to roam. 
SPOKEN.--Most strordinary thing whenever I 
get a 
little 
Jolly, my legs get so ducedly obstinate, One wants to lay 
down, and the other wants to go round the corner, in fact 
they give me a 
gentle hint that I'm— 
Drunk again, Drunk again ! 
I'm Timothy Tottle, I'm fond of my bottle, hic! 
Drunk again, Drunk again! 
A 
Jolly old cockle am I. 
Like Loyal boys we toasted the Queen. 
And drank hc r 
health too all serene ! 
There were fifteen of us, I 
counted nineteen 
1 
hat's rather strange you will s!-ty, 
We drank every one's health, and then our own, 
Until every blessed bottle had flown, 
Then we gave such a 
cheer as never was known, 
With a 
Hip, hip. hip. hooray ! 
Z:3 
SPOIIEN.—I made a 
speech, I 
said, I 
don't exactly re-
member what I 
did say I 
know I 
began it on my legs and 
finished it under the table, when some one remarked in 
reply— 
Drunk again, & c., 
I'm fond of a 
bottle of Sherry or Port, 
With that Logwood stuff— I'm not to be caught, 
Good forty years old, Hal! that's the sort! 
Now of such I'm a 
capital judge. 
Mind I 
don't turn up my nose at Brandy or Gin! 
At Whisky or Rum, I 
can do a " go in," 
To refuse any drink I 
consider a 
sin! 
And " Teetotalers twaddle's" all fudge ! 
SPOKEN.—Talking about Teetotalers, have you seen my 
Landlady's nose ? 
She's one, and gives me notice to quit 
overy week for getting— 
Drunk again, 47e. 
I 
must now toddle round to number three, 
I 
wish number three would come round to me, 
For if a 
Policeman this party should see, 
That " minion" will make out a 
case! 
For since this new Licensing act's come out, 
It's not safe for a 
fellow to go much about, 
You chance to get into " cell" no doubt, 
And that's not a " comfable" place. 
SPOKEN. —No, not but what I'm all right enough, it's my 
legs that get me into trouble, they are so abstroplopsus, 
And this is the way they serve me after sticking to ' ern all 
these years, ingratitude ! They're the only pair I've got at 
present or I 
wouldn't put up with it, for they will keep on 
getting— 
Drunk again, Drunk again! 
Timothy Tottle's so fond of his bottle, hic ! 
Drunk again, Drunk again!

Now Barney, if I

You must give up this drinkin' right away; 
And tell me where you go, that I

And not go off and leave me some fine day. 
BARNEY. 
Now Mollie, what's the use to be a

I'll never more be drinkin' when we're wed;

Oh! Barney, mind your blarney, 
Don't be after thinkin' now that I'm a

In a 
manlier remarkably loose, 
And to go on a 
spree I 
know would suit me, 
For I 
mustn'n go home, tis no use. 
Oh I

My spirits so lively and spruce, 
I 
could sing or play in a

For I 
do feel so awfully loose.

For I 
give y.ti my word this would not have occurred 
Had I 
not felt so awfully loose. 
I 
do feel, &c. 
Then to woo and to coo I 
embraced every chance 
In a 
style that was certainly loose, 
For I 
pressed her to go to the Argyle to dance, 
And really would take no excuse. 
I 
said twould be bliss if she gave me a 
kiss, 
And to raise her veil tried to induce, 
Who is that ! on my life ! I've been courting my wife, 
Oil I 
did feel so awfully loose. 
I 
do feel, &e. 
Now what she said and I 
said may easily be guessed 
We both felt remarkably loose, 
The dispute grew so warm that I 
thought it the best 
To leave her by way of a 
truce. 
So I 
left her behind, and comfort I 
find 
In imbibing the generous juice ; 
Oh I 
shall get it hot, but I 
don't care a

For to- night I 
am out on the loose.

Last night I 
was out rather late— 
'Twas only an innocent spree— 
My wife for my coming did wait, 
When sleeping I 
thought she would be ; 
found her in temper and tears ; 
Oh she cried, it's a 
sin and a 
shame— 
And she scratched both my eyes and my ears., 
But I 
told her I 
soon would explain.

The " Club" had a 
meeting, to night, love, 
Of bus'ness we had a 
great sight. love ; 
Don't think for a 
moment I'm tight love, 
I've only been down to the Club. 
My boots I 
left down in the hall, 
And softly I 
crept up the stairs ; 
3. kept rather close to the wall, 
And thought to ascend unawares ; 
But just as I 
got to the door, 
I 
seemed lo get lost in the dark ; 
I 
stumbled and fell on the floor, 
And just then I 
could only remark— 
The " Club" had, &T. 
She sobbed and she wept and she screamed, 
And said she'd go back to her Ma ; 
While I 
on the mantel-piece leaned, 
And tried to enjoy my cigar.

To my little Sweetheart, Annie, o'er the way. 
Then there came an answer, loving, kind and true— 
Thanks for those sweet posies, blue bells wet with dew. 
CHORUS. 
That's the way I 
won her. 
It is, upon my honor. 
My life is blissful since I

Those pret ty flowers to Annie, o'er the way. 
Tint she is sweeter, fairer, far than you, 
Beautiful blue bells, wet with morning dew. 
[Sympla]

Now, every evening you can find me there, 
In that litth cottage with my love so fair, 
Wooing and cooing like two little doves— 
Pleasure pursuing, while exchanging loves. 
Then if you had seen her sitting by my side, 
When I 
asked the question, " Will you be my bride ?" 
How she blushed and trembled, and her eyes so blue, 
Looked just like those flowers, blue bells wet with dew.

Twice as lair and twice as pretty 
As the early, smiling. dew-besprinkled rose, 
Or the lily, or thcl mignonettes, 
The heliotrop ,! 
or violets ! 
There's none of them such beauty can disclose. 
Her eyes are blue and bright, 
Her teeth are pearly white ; 
And nature painted roses in her cheeks. 
She is roguish, and she's witty— 
Is my pretty little Kitty ! 
And you hear a 
choir of Angels when she speaks.

Oh, yes ! I 
love my Kitty so. [Symph] 
And she loves me, yes, that I 
know. [Symph] 
Oh ! you ought to hear me talking, 
When I'm out with Kitty walking, 
And she leans so gracefully upon my arm. 
Then to see me throw the style on, 
With my gallus little tile on. 
And you bet a 
pile on, like a 
charm. 
Underneath the sweet magnolia— 
Now, remember what I 
told yer— 
That's the place I 
met Miss Kitty Allilee. 
Where the sweet magnolia blossom, 
shed its petals on her bosom ; 
And I 
had to brush them off so lovingly 
But she seemed to kill decline. 
When I 
said, ‘• Will you be mine r 
And I 
pressed her closer to my loving breast. 
Then she said, 
You may repent it— 
Hasty wedings are relented !" 
That was all she said, bat you can guess the rest.

pounds, gallons, yards, feet, days, weeks, Szc., from one to a 
thousand, at one- quarter of a 
cent, up to ten dollars, in so easy 
and expeditious a 
manner, that a 
person unaccustomed with 
arithmetic may by looking at the head of the page to find the 
given price, and at the column on the side for the number 
wanted, tell with the utmost accuracy the amount of value 
required. 
To those versed in figures it cannot fail to be 
equally useful, as it will serve to prove their own calculations, 
when otherwise, through the hurry of business, they might 
seem doubtful.
