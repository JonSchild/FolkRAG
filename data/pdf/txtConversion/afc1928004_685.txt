Oh, the darkies' moonlight picnic, 
Takes place but once a 
year, 
And all the high-toned colored folks, 
They come from far and near. 
We have a 
large Pavilion built, 
Way out upon the green, 
And hosts of handsome yellow gals, 
Can always there be seen. 
CHORUS. 
The music sweetly plays, . 
As around the room we glide, 
One gent and well dressed lady, 
Always dancing side by side.

And at the moonlight picnic, don't 
We darkies cut a

All join hands, then cross over, 
Then back to your places glide,

With your darling by your side. 
Then you treat her to refreshments, 
Make the other coons look sick, 
Oh, what fun we'll always have, 
At the darkies' moonlight picnic.

Oh, good evening to you one and all, 
We've just dropped in, you see; 
We are two happy, careless nigs, 
All the way from Tennessee. 
Oh, we just come down to see our gals, 
To take them to the ball; 
When us they see how they will shout: 
There's the happiest coons of all.

We'll take our gals down home; 
And arm in arm we'll promenade, 
And talk of love alone. 
Oh, then we will get married 
And then go to a 
ball, 
Oh, how the wenches they will shout: 
There goes the happiest coons of all,

There's a 
terrible man and he lives next door, 
And he keeps the place in 'a great uproar; 
To the neighbors here he's a 
regular bore, 
For he works away till his fingers are sore, 
On his musical Autophone. 
In the morning out of bed he'll get ; 
And he'll seize his perforated pet; 
Such a 
man before you never met, 
Sure the houses here are all to let. 
With his musieal A 
utophone. 
He will scarcely stop for to eat his meals, 
As he grinds away at his jigs and reels; 
As he works his fingers and stamps his heels, 
To his musical Autophone. 
There is neither mosquitos, flies nor fleas, 
That can make this fellow his noise to cease; 
And there's no use of saying any more for he's 
A 
terror with the Autophone,

I've been trying hard to get of late 
A new subject for a 
song; 
les one about conundrums, 
And it won't detain you long; 
It's about the funny puzzles, 
-You hear them every day, 
If you'll give me your attention, 
I 
will sing them in my lay; 
Now suppose it takes a 
barrel of tar 
To boil a 
raisin fire, 
A 
lamp post full of soap suds 
To make a 
stuffed club cry, 
An injun rubber shoe and a 
paper collar too, 
Can you fill up full an elephant's trunk 
With a 
spittoon full of glue. 
A 
bamfat nig in de garden dig 
When boring down for oil, 
A 
carpet sack chew a 
ton of coal 
To make a 
hoe cake boil, 
A possum take a 
cob web 
And a 
pump to blow his nose, 
What will it take to despise a 
mule 
Cause he's dressed in ragged clothes? 
Then suppose a 
hen should hatch an ox, 
And a 
donkey have a 
nest, 
A 
nigger full of bunion salve 
On a 
rail fence walking west, 
A chaw of old tobacco 
And a 
paper collar gilt, 
Can a 
pickeled beat play seven up, 
In the house that Johnny built.

CUR AT MY HEELS. 
As sung by -W ILLIAMS S. 
SI'LLY to many smiles. 
: 
0 : 
I 
dislike to trust men who hang on to the truth, 
And haven't the nerve to tell lies; 
I 
like to hear a 
man say he killed fifty bears, 
When he knows in his heart they were flies. 
It may not be pleasant to have five thousand dollars 
Given you by each tramp you meet, 
But it's better to find your mother-in-law drunk 
Than to judge a 
poor girl by her feet, 
Crionus: 
For I 
do like a 
Tom cat with a 
high tenor voice, 
A Maria that can kick, fight and steal; 
I 
like a 
spitz poodle with all kinds of fleas, 
But I 
don't like a 
cur at my heels. 
I 
like to see a 
chambermaid in a 
hotel 
Go through every new boarder's trunk, 
I 
like to see a 
preacher on Sunday in church, 
And on Monday in debt or on a-drunk; 
I 
don't like a 
maiden of sweet sixty-four 
To tell me she's just seventeen, 
But give me the girl from old Boston town 
Who can wrestle with baked pork and beans. 
CHORUS: 
For I 
do like boiled eggs that have seen better days, 
I 
can paralyze all kinds of veal; 
I 
can battle successfully with all kinds of soup, 
But I 
don't care to miss a 
square meal,

South Carolina Wenches. 
Written and sung by THE RUSSELLS with great success. 
You see before you now two peculiar sort of nigs 
Aunt Hannah and Aunt Chloe, 
For dancing in the ballet or shuffling in the jigs, 
There's where it is our glory. 
But when we lived in Florida how happy we were then; 
We had a 
good old massa and he was the best of men. 
CHORUS. 
Old aunt Hannah and aunt Chloe 
Is happy as can be; 
Old aunt Hannah and aunt Chloe 
Were born way down in Florida. 
(Dance.) 
Them good old days are gone, and they'll never come 
no more 
To the children of this nation, 
When we would. sing and dance on the old kitchen floor, 
And raise a 
big sensation; 
You could hear us darkies laughing almost a 
mile around, 
When all was still and silent on the old plantation 
s."*. ground.

Black and Tan. 
Original, by W ILLIAMS and SULLY. 
Oh, here I 
am, a 
gallus fig, 
I 
travel on my shape; 
I 
was born in Alabama, 
Down by the old cane brake. 
Old massa used to wollop me, 
And away from him I 
ran ; 
So, white folks, watch the motion 
Of this lively Black and Tan. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, here I 
am, a 
gallus fig, 
I 
travel on my shape; 
I 
was born in Alabama, 
Down by the old cane brake. 
And when at dancing I 
do go, 
The wenches at me stare ; 
They say he would make quite a 
beau, 
With nice black curly hair. 
And when to dance I 
do begin. 
The wenches round me stand, 
To watch the evolution of 
This happy Black and Tan. 
Oh, here I 
am, ace. 
Now, kind friends, I 
must say good-bye, 
For I 
must quickly go; 
There's a 
little wench a 
waiting, 
A 
couple of doors below. 
She says that I 
am just her style, 
I 
know it is no sham, 
Beumse she's captivated with 
This happy Black and Tan. 
Oh, here I

BABY MINE. 
Is sung with great success by BILLY MCALLISTER, with I. W . 
BAIRD'br 
FAMOUS MINSTRELS. 
I've a 
baby in Kalamazoo. 
Baby mine—baby mine; 
He can skip the tra-la-la-loo, 
Baby mine—baby mine. 
He swings on our back gate, 
Tackles peaches by the crate, 
On a 
fishball he can skate, 
Baby mine—baby mine, 
He can eat a 
barrel of cake, 
Baby mine. 
He makes faces at the women, 
Baby mine—baby mine; 
In a 
soup bowl he goes swimming, 
Baby mine—baby mine. 
Out of the ash-pan we do yank him; 
In his high chair we do plank him, 
Oh, heavens! how we spank him, 
Baby mine—baby mine, 
His face would cave a 
bank in. 
Baby mine. 
At the table he is queer, 
Baby mine—baby mine; 
Stuffs the pan cakes in his ear, 
Baby mine—baby mine. 
Rubs molasses on his nose, 
Spills the mustard on his clothes, 
He jabs the hash between his toes, 
Baby mine—baby mine, 
And we wash him with a 
hose, 
Baby mine.

SCOTCH TERRIER JANE. 
Written by JAI= Drum, and sung with great success by DONNELLY 
1it DREW, at Tony Pastor's Theatre, Broadway, N. Y. 
Parody on Scotch Lassie Jean. 
I 
once knew a 
maiden who in New York did dwell, 
She was ugly and cranky all the time; 
She was struck on a 
baker and a 
dizzy undertaker, 
And a 
butcher in Cincinnati over the Rhine; 
One night the butcher called with a 
couple of pork 
chops, 
His love he tried to explain; 
He gave her a 
squeeze, and off came his nose, 
From the breath of this Scotch Terrier Jane. 
CHORUS: 
Oh, Jane, Oh, Jane, I've got you on the brain, 
You have no reason to explain; 
Your teeth they are false, from taking epsom salts, 
You're my liver-lip Scotch Terrier Jane. 
(Repeat). 
She's lovely and fair, and her feet they were bare, 
Her bustle it stuck out twenty feet; 
One day in the house she happened to eat a 
mouse, 
It gave all her lovers a 
treat; 
The butcher and the baker, and the dizzy undertaker, 
They went crazy when they all heard the news; 
I 
often heard them say, when she was put away, 
She died from hoisting Mott St. Booze. 
CHORUS: 
Oh, Jane, Oh, Jane, my club-footed Jane, 
With tears I 
have cause to explain; 
You're a 
daisy that was lazy, your lips they were greasy, 
You're my sweet-scented Scotch Terrier Jane, 
(Repeat).

Alabama Lou. 
Composed by W. J. SULIN, and sung by Witt!Asts and Sutt.v. 
Oh, I've just come here to see my gal, I 
love her, too, quite well, 
She lives in yonder cottage, and with her I 
must dwell. 
She is handsome, fair and beautiful, so gentle and so tall, 
In fact she takes the shine away from all. 
We met one fine day, it was in the month of May, 
While leisurely meandering the festive gay Broadway. 
She winked at me, I 
winked at her, and next day was to meet 
This charmer with the pretty little feet. 
CHORUS. 
My Lou ! 
My Lou! 
(Sym.). 
(Sym.) 
She is the prettiest girl I 
ever knew. 
I 
love her to destraction, 
That's a 
heap of satisfaction, 
My sweet, my charming Alabama Lou. , 
I 
wonder who that was that just came in that gate, 
I 
wonder if it was that handsome darkey Pete? 
I 
met him only yesterday while walking down Broadway, , 
And he has been taking liberty to follow me all de wayj 
I 
only wish he'd waited until I 
had come out; 
He'd make me feel so happy by taking a 
little walk, 
But now he's gone and won't come back, I 
don't know whai 
I'll do, 
While waiting for my charming little Petejl 
ALABAMA LOU— Continued. 
CHORUS. 
My Pete! (Sym.) 
My Pete! 
(Sym.) 
He is as handsome as you would want to meet. 
I 
love him to destraction, 
That's a 
heap of satisfaction, 
My sweet, my charming Alabama Pete. 
HE— 
Good evening, Lou, we've met again, 
And now before we part 
I 
wish to pop the question— 
I 
do with all my heart. 
SHY,- 
Well, what is it, Pete, go on and speak, 
I'll listen with all my heart 
To what you have to say, 
My charming Pete. 
HE— 
Will you be my wife ? 
That's what I 
want to know; 
And let's jine hands 
And a 
traveling we will go. 
SHE— 
All right, my Pete, I 
will be yours, 
And happy we will be,

Gallus Pete and Jake. 
Written by W. J. SULLY, and sung with immense success by W ILLIAMS 
and SULLY. 
We are two happy little mokes, 
We have just arrived in town, 
We came from old Virginny State, 
Our massa's name was Brown. 
But when us darkies we got free, 
We soon gave him de shake, 
And came up North, where all de folks 
Call us gallus Pete and Jake. 
CHORUS. 
Oh yes, you see how loose we feel, ( Break) 
When we twist or shake our heel. ( Break) 
Oh yes. we'll do the best we can, 
We'll please you for your sake, 
And when we leave you can't forget 
This gallus Pete and Jake. 
Politicians soon we'll be 
For Congress we will run ; 
The President he is our friend, 
I 
guess it can be done. 
Then to Washington we will go, 
The laws we'll help to make ; 
What healthy senatots they will find 
In gallus Pete and Jake. 
Oh yes, you see, &c

GRANDFATII8ft S 
PANTS. 
Parody on Grandma's Old Arm Chair. 
Sang by FRANK Lyons 
at Comstock's Opera House, Columbus. 
----:0:----
My grandfather, he, at the age of eighty-three, 
One day he took a 
notion he would die; 
And after he was dead, of course the will was read, 
By a 
lawyer as we all were passing by; 
Unto my brother Bill, he left an old saw mill, 
To my sister he bequeated our gray mare, Nance% 
But when it came to me, the lawyer then, said he 
Has left to you his old brown pants, 
ClIORIIS: 
But how they giggled, how they yelled, 
Even my sister, my dear Isabel; 
Gave me the laugh whene'er she had the chance, 
When grandpa only left to me his old brown pants. 
My brother Bill one day, just to pass the time away; 
In the river, why he thought he'd take a 
swim; 
When a 
stray goat showed his nose, 'and he' eat up 
poor Bill's clothes, 
It was Summer, and his garments they were thin; 
Now Bill he kicked and swore, when he couldn't 
leave the shore, 
And I 
saw his situation at a 
glance; 
I 
give one laugh and yell, I 
said now brother, Bill. 
Don't you wish you had the old brown pants. 
(Chorus),

THE FISHERMAN AND HIS CHILD; 
Sung by Toas DIXON at the San Franciseo Minstrels, and m&de 
Popular by JAMES O'NEIL. 
The fisherman and his child are drowned, 
Came ringing through the town; 
The father and child lay under the tide, 
And friends did mourn around; 
The poor wife and mother prayed aloud, 
Oh, God! it cannot be, 
For in yonder mist I 
see them still, 
Their milk-white sails I 
see. 
(Repeat last 2 
lines.) 
CHORUS: 
'Twas the voice of their God that they heard 
As they sank in the deep; 
Come to me, I 
love thee, 
And thy precious soul I'll keep, 
Come to me, I 
love thee, 
Thy precious soul I'll keep. 
The fisherman saw his boat was lost, 
He tried to save his child, 
He battled the waves with all human power, 
But the wind was howling wild; 
Then he spoke to his child, 
She answered not; he raised her tiny head, 
He cried in despair: Thy will be done! 
The child he loved was dead. 
(Repeat 2 
last lines.) 
And when the storms ceased, the sea went down, 
Brave men went on the shore, 
The tide bad gone out, they searched all about, 
From the sea two forms they bore, 
Their faces were calm, their hands were raised, 
As if in silent prayer, 
The father in life had clasped his child, 
In death they found him there. 
(Repeat 2 
last fixes.) 
Yaller Dog's Love For a 
Nigger, 
—
0:0:— 
Recitation, as, delivered by FRANK 078/IMAE. 
Dar's a 
lone grave on de oder side of de creek 
Dat knows no Decoration Day, 
For him who over yonder sleeps 
Is only a 
Nigger, dey say! 
Dey gave him his freedom, but took away his home, 
He died an old vagrant, entirely unknown, 
And left not a 
soul to be sad 
But an ole yaller dog—'twas all dat he had. 
Dey dug a 
rude hole and chucked him away, 
Dis poor ole colored slave; 
Not a 
prayer for his rest did anyone say, 
And dat ole yaller dog lay down on his grave, 
And dar you can see him day after day, 
At morning, at eve and at noon; 
But dar's no inducements can drive him away 
From his place beside de grave of a 
coon. 
Dar's a 
mighty fine monument close by, 
But to me dis little mound looks bigger; 
Vor dar's a 
monument money can't buy--
A 
yeller dog's love for a 
nigger.

THE GEM OF THE SEA. 
Written by PAT REILLY. 
-: 
0:-
With all condescension I'd turn your attention, 
To what I 
would mention of Erin so green; 
And without hesitation, I'd show how that nation 
Became of creation the gem and the queen. 
It happened one morning without any warning, 
That Venus was born in the beautiful sea, 
And be that same token, a-ad sure 'was prevoking, 
Her pinions were soaking and would not give play, 
Till Neptune who knew her began to pursue her 
In order to woo her, the wicked old Jew; 
And he very nigh caught her on the top of the water, 
Great Jupiter's daughter who cried philaloo. 
So jove, the great genius looked down and saw Venus, 
And Neptune so heinous pursuing her wild; 
So he roared out in thunder I'd tear him asunder, 
And sure 'twas no wonder for teasing his child. 
So a 
star that was flying around him aspiring, 
He seized without sighing and hurled it below, 
Where it tumbled like winking on Neptune while 
sinking. 
And gave him I'm thinking a 
broth of a 
blow, 
That star was dryland both lowland and highland, 
And formed a 
sweet island the land of my birth; 
Thus plain is the story, case sent down from glory, 
That Erin so hoary is a 
heaven on earth. 
So Venus jumped neatly on Erin so stately, 
But, fainted case lately so bothered and pressed; 
Which much did bewilder but ere it had killed her, 
Her father distilled her a 
drop of the best. 
That glass so victorious it made her feel glorious, 
A 
little uproarious I 
fear it might proove; 
Hence how can ye's blame us that Erin's so famous, 
For beauty and murder and whiskey and love.

In our back yard there lives two bums, 
They can dance upon their gums; 
They never had no thumbs, 
And with Ben Butler they were chums. 
CHORUS: 
Oh, they are crazy and lazy, 
Garfield and Ilazey; 
They are gentlemen of rank, 
Cage them up in some big tank, 
And we'll let them rob some bank, 
Then bite off their nose. 
In our back alley lives a 
cat, 
And her maiden name is Pat; 
She could sleep in an old hat, 
And in a 
butcher's she eats fut. 
In our back alley lives a 
guy, 
And he never told a 
lie; 
He is not afraid to die, 
And he makes his living stealing pie.

They ain't pleasing, they are teasing, 
Like lemons they need squeezing, 
He's got warts upon his nose, 
He never wore no clothes, 
He never sleeps, he'd always doze, 
And wash himself in soup.

Inspired our brave Army and Navy of Blue.

BEEP IT MUM. 
Sang by FRANI( LEWIS at Colisseum Theatre, Detroit, with great 
anceess, and at Theatre Comique, and at Harry Miner's Theatre, N.Y. 
About twelve o'clock upon one Winter's night, 
Keep it mum; 
When this individual came to light, 
Keep it mum; 
When I 
was a 
lad, I 
was very headstrong, 
With my teacher at school I 
could not get along; 
But I 
hope what I'll tell you to-night in my song, 
You'll keep it mum. 
The husband comes home from his club late at night 
Keep it mum: 
When the sun it is shining at break of daylight, 
Keep it mum; 
lie tells his dear wife he's been out with a 
friend, 
And, of course, it was business he had to attend; 
She believes all he says, ' till in nine months they send 
Well, keep it mum. 
some wives get religion when parsons do call, 
Keep it mum; 
On a_s,lass of old toddy, they glory do bawl, 
Keep it mum; 
The husband goes to labor up town, 
The parson stops at me, do not frown, 
Alone, when together, they glory rake down, 
But keep it mum. 
Now, there is Bob Ingersoll says there no hell, 
Keep it mum, 
That is the doctrine Robert does tell, 
Keep it mum; 
Now Bobby may walk, he may preach, he may prep 
And talk about 'Hell in his own funny way; 
But, perhaps he will find it out some future day, 
He'll keep it mum.

MULCAHEY'S COUSIN DAN. 
A Recitation. 
Written for PAT ROONEY by " Den Morton," 
„copyrighted by A. 
J. 
FISHER. 188. 
The Half-Breeds and the Stalwarts 
Had a 
rough-and-tumble fight, 
The Half-Breeds had Jim Blaine for a 
leader, 
The Stalwarts said Conklin was right; 
Like Kilkenny cats they fought, 
Like bull- dogs, did growl and grin; 
And though Conklin's friends fought nobly, 
The man from Maine did win. 
Now, I'm neither a 
Half-Breed or Stalwart, 
To no party do I 
belong; 
And though for the spoils they wrangle, 
I 
say both sides were wrong. 
To settle this whole question, 
I 
have an easy plan; 
It is, to make a 
United States' Senator of 
Mulcaliey's Cousin Dan. 
If Muleahey's cousin was Senator, 
He'd make a 
change all round; 
No thieving star route jobbers 
In this country would be found; 
Beecher who says that a 
poor man 
Should live upon water and bread, 
Would have to kiss the Plymouth Church lane, 
While he stood upon his head.

In the Tombs windy Talmadge, 
Four months, three times a

I 
would play Billee Taylor 
In the tragedy of Olivette. 
I'd then take Susan Anthony, 
And turn her into a 
man; 
If they made a 
United States' Senator of 
Mulcahey's Cousin Dan. 
He'd sweep the streets of New York with Captain 
Williams, 
He'd then bounce Mayor Grace; 
4
4i_nd make Owney Geoghegan 
Run the City Hall in his place. 
fle'd run the 3d avenue cars to Ireland, 
And steamboats to the skies; 
he'd make bran new electric lights 
Out of the crusts of apple pies. 
He'd make Dennis Kearney president, 
Then the Chinese would have to go; 
Christmas would come in summer, 
On 4th of July we'd have snow. 
The Bulls and Bears of Wall street, 
In the Central Park would stand; 
When we make a 
United States' senator of 
Muicahey's Cousin Dan.

YOU MAY KISS AND CARESS ME.

You've young fellows slipped upon a

But here is something new; 
I'm in love with Cranky Ann, and I 
asked her for her hand, 
And she gave it to me right across the ear. 
If there's any young girl here would like to treat me to 
some beer, 
I 
will meet her in the bar-room by and by. 
CHORUS: 
You may kiss and caress me and I'll never say no, 
I 
couldn't say no, I 
wouldn't suy no; 
Buy me a

keg of beer or so, 
But don't you tell my sister. 
As you can plainly see, with them we tra la la lee, 
They throw gumdrops at me, and follow me all over the 
town 
Like a 
gang of hungry bees, 
And buy me lemonade and taffy all the day; 
There's one in the gallery, you rascal I 
can see, 
You come here because you couldn't stay away. 
If to kiss me you would try, I 
know that I 
should die, 
And quietly pull down the blind and say:

Oh, come and kiss me quick, I'll elke you with

This life is like a 
river 
A 
running in and out, 
This year a 
man may be quite poor, 
And next year have money to count; 
The man who is the banker now, 
Next year may be the tramp; 
A 
traveling in the snow and rain, 
With clothing ragged and damp; 
Perhaps a 
fast life he lead, 
And, perplexed with doubt, 
He didn't watch the breakers 
When the tide was going out. 
Cnonus; 
So now take heed to what I 
say, 
Be careful do not doubt, 
For you'll find it very difficult, 
To stop the tide from going out. 
Then if we want to be successful, 
And lead a 
happy life, - 
We must meet trouble halfway, 
Devoid of care and strife; 
We must work with honest labor, 
Always scorning every scamp; 
And if prosperity shines upon us, 
Help the poor and needy tramp; 
We will never miss the nickel 
That we give with hand stretched out; 
And some day it will come back to us, 
When the tide is going out.

Around its childish glee, 
On such a

Oh! Father, in thy mercy save 
Our sailors on the sea. 
The sailor little thinks, when he 
Lets out upon the wave, 
The worn-out ship in which he sails, 
May bear him to his grave; 
Should storm arise, her rotten planks 
To pieces soon may go; 
Yet ships like this are sent to 
That man may richer grow.

MAHONEY'S FENIAN CAT. 
Written, composed and sung by GEO. W .

Ventriloquist. 
-:0: 
On our back fence at twelve at night 
A big buck cat, striped black and white, 
Meanders out to look for tight— 
Mahoney's Fenian cat. 
With an eye gouged out and ears chawed off, 
With a 
half-mast tail and the whooping cough; 
Strange ratters thought they'd something soft 
On Mahoney's four-act eat. 
No cat or dog had pluck or gaul 
To give McGuire's pup a 
fall, 
So down he went to open the ball 
With Maloney's Thomas dog. 
Out from McGuire's alley gate 
lie straightway did perambulate, 
Intending to make sausage meat 
Of Mahoney's brindle cat. 
They met upon McGuire's shed, 
With hair on end and eyeballs red, 
With yells and howls ' ti,vould raise the dead— 
The slaughter it began. 
In half the time ye'd say begob 
Tile air was full of IMcGuire's dog; 
While up and down McGuire's fence, 
The picture of pure innocence, 
Mahoney's cat sas-shayed. 
Then from the roof a 
brick was fired, 
I'd take me oath it was McGuire; 
It struck the cat between the eyes, 
And down he went, but he didn't rise. 
There's a 
statue where this hero lies— 
Mahoney's Fenian cat.

How can we bear to leave thee, 
Our noses blue with cold; 
And love, we won't deceive thee, 
Our coats are worn and old! 
The snow and rain are falling, 
There doesn't shine a 
star, 
While at thy window bawling, 
We strike the light " Catarrh!" 
CHORUS 
How can we bear to leave thee, 
The Toni cat answers shrill, 
And sweet, we won't deceive thee, 
Of serenades we've had our fill! 
How can we bear to leave thee, 
Thou breathest no reply; 
Oh snore not while we weave thee, 
A 
gentle lullaby! 
Alas! we see a 
night cap 
At yonder window pane, 
The voice of no polite chap, 
Yells: " Don't come here again!" 
How can we bear to leave thee, 
We heard the milkman's yell; 
And love we won't deceive thee, 
That was a 
brick that fell! 
Good-bye, good-bye sweet darling, 
The rheumatiz we fear, 
And hark! this copper howling; 
" 
You just git out of here!"

 :0.-
Of all the young swells that you ever seen, 
There's none for to equal us two La Da Das; 
,
444; 
We have just come over from the land of the green, 
Where we left the gang and our Ma Ma,s. 
We are noted for being two bashful young men, 
Especially where ladies are found; 
If you go into any of the fashionable balls, 
You will hear the word go around. 
CHORUS: 
Oh, my! ain't they two babies, 
Look at the swells with the glass on their eye; 
Oh, yes, they're the pets of the ladies, 
Clarence and Arthur, now don't they look fly. 
Now Clarence and Arthur, .as everyone knows, 
Drinks wine from the keg as fast as it flows; 
Although we are not lushers that have a 
red nose; 
We go for the bowl as far as it goes. 
We don't care for money although we have none, 
Our parents are very well off; 
We get through on our face, if not on our shape, 
e 
are Clarence and Arthur the toffs. (Chorus).

MICHAEL BRADY'S SHIRT. 
Composed and sung by GEO. W . 
CALLAHAN, the Ventriloquist. 
My name is Michael Brady, and I 
am not ashamed to own, 
I 
am honest and I 
am dacent if I 
am only left alone; 
But the gang that hangs around me they are a 
terrible clan, 
And when I 
moved around them I 
was like a 
crazy man. 
They roar and bawl the whole night long, with conversa-
tion strong, 
I 
haven't slept for forty nights in the house where I 
belong. 
Now the first one to kick up a 
row was Chateau Jane McGee 
If my wife don't go up and fight with her, she'll come and 
fight with me. 
She stole a 
shirt from our back yard, and gave it to her 
son Dan, 
I 
took it from his back in a 
ball-room, by the owner I 
am 
the man. 
I 
made a 
holy show of him, I 
ran him down like dirt, 
And he near goes mad when the boys all cry: " Who stole 
Mike Brady's shirt?" 
Their rooms is to let in the parlor, Italians just moved in, 
With fourteen harps and tiddlers, all daunt working min. 
What Mary .McGaskin did last night, I 
swear it was a 
sin, 
She trill her durty dish-water on the mackirony min. 
Such holy murder you never heard, since the day that you 
was born, 
Was among them darned Italians in the house where I 
belong. 
Now there's my daughter Johanna, she sings ilianne a 
store, 
She goes to balls and picnics with a 
huzzy of a 
girl next 
door. 
McFarling's boy he stole a 
goat and he put it in our wood-
shed, 
If he ever does the like ag-in, 
1- rake his father's head. 
I 
am glad I 
am going to leave them to let them bawl and 
shout, 
I'll take down the stove to-morrow and be Heavins I'll 
move out.

On Scotland's fair hills, or the mountains and rills, 
I've wandered there many a 
happy day; 
In looking at the lads and the lasses on the green, 
'Neath the fine old hills of Scotland far away. 
I've looked for her coming, but she's not com.t as yet, 
The truth seems to dawn on me plain; 
They say she is false but I'll still believe her mine, 
She's my darling blue-eyed Scotch lassie Jean. 
0 Jean, my dearest Jean! 
Come to your laddie once again; 
They say you are false, but I'll still believe you mine, 
You re my darling blue-eyed Scotch lassie Jean. 
She said she soon would meet me, but I've waited long in 
vain, 
In lands far away she doth roam; 
Her promise she will keep, 0 ! break it not, my Jean, 
We'll be happy in our bonnie little home. 
Then let me not long wait, let me meet you soon, my Jean. 
And Heav'n will then smile on our love; 
And when life is ended, we'll leave this earthly scene, 
Wben our hearts will dwell in joy and bliss above.

You Were False, But I'll Forgive You. 
Sung with immense success by Miss Georgie Mebaotte 
the Queen Serio-Comique. 
Fare thee well, for once I 
loved you, 
Even more than tongue can tell, 
Little did I 
think you'd leave me, 
Now I 
bid you all farewell. 
You have wrecked the heart I 
cherished, 
You have doomed me day by day, 
You are false but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may. 
(Repeat last two lines.] 
When I 
saw your eyes in virtue. 
I 
could scarce believe my own, 
When I 
heard your voice in anger, 
It was death to every tone. 
They have told you some false stories, 
And you believed them all they sq. 
You are false but I'll forgive you. 
But forget you I 
never may. 
[Repeat last two lines.] 
One more word and all is over, 
Why are you unkind to me? 
Tell me why you do not love me, 
Turn aside how can it be ? 
No word not one word of pleasure. 
You believe them all 'ley say, 
You are false but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may.

Our name is Pat and Kittie Car, 
Yrom Castle Bar we came; 
Two Irish dancers sure we are, 
And for it we've gained great fame; 
The boys and girls when work was done, 
They would come from near and far; 
All bent on danchig reels and jigs, 
With the pair from Castle Bar. 
At a 
jig or a 
reel on tge or heel, 
We're unequaled near or far; 
Arrah by night or day there's none so gay 
As the pair from Castle Bar. 
Of champion dancers we've a 
lot, 
Who dance with clogs or skates; 
Prize belts and silver medals 
They have got on their breasts as large as plates. 
When each comes on the stage to dance, 
Sure he thinks himself a 
star; 
With their fancy touches they stand no chancy 
With the pair from Castle Bar.

On the coast near the South Atlantic sea, 
The land where they grow the rice and con, 
And sugar-cane you'll see 
In the clime where we were born; 
Beneath the sun's warm glow, 
In that sunny land so far away, 
Where the rivers Nile and Congo flow; 
There the coons are light and gay, 
And while the hours away, 
With us Nigs of the Mozambique.

With those from far and near, 
Us Nigs of the Mozambique. 
We worked in the fields of sugar-cane, 
From early morn until sundown, 
It was there we gained our name, 
For miles and miles around; 
All among the yellow boys, 
At night when all our work was done, 
We'd sing and dance and make a

It was then we had the fun, 
When the sun had gone to rest, 
Us Nigs of the :Mozambique.

Oh here we are an Irish pair! 
Happy, jolly, happy Irish pair, 
And from Ireland we came— 
That's where we gained our name. 
Oh, how we love to sing and dance 
To pass away the time when'er we get a

We came over here from Padd 's

To see the sights so grand.

When we were in that happy isle. 
Where the boys and the girls are free from care.

To dance the merry hours away. 
No matter whether rambling on the green 
Or in our cabins so elegant and clean, 
Our hearts were ever free from care, 
We attended every Donnybrook Fair.

Oh! freckled face Gauger Pill-garlic, 
The bummers and loafers all cry; 
They say use your head for a 
bucket, 
And smother yourself in mince pie; 
They say you're the worst in creation, 
A 
free lunch you'd tackle without fear; 
A 
station house is a 
great recreation, 
And this is the slang you will hear. 
CHORUS: 
A 
mixer for the Gauger Pill-garlic, 
For working a 
servant girl's pocket; 
lie thought he'd go off on a 
racket, 
And drink with the money quite free. 
A 
copper nabbed him by the collar 
And said " give that girl every dollar; 
In Sing Sing .I'll give you a 
parlor, 
And you can't crack a 
crib any more.' 
The tramp and the political bummer 
Has a 
nose that from rum brightly shines; 
And never does hard work ever bother them, 
And they're always complaining of the times. 
With a 
tomato can and a 
stick in their pocket, 
On the watch for new kegs of stale beer; 
Oh! a 
bar-room who a 
fire in the Winter 
Gives a 
gauger a 
jolly old steer.

Then where is the Gauger Pill-garlic, 
His face it would give you the colic; 
I 
think he's gone off on a 
frolic 
With a 
man by the name of Rooney. 
lie's drinking champagne in the poor house, 
And feeding on feather weight hash; 
They say he's gone off with Brother Talmage, 
And with Beecher and Elizabeth to mash. 
Oh! jailers and coppers all know him, 
A 
staff once he was on the press; 
Ten cents for a 
ball he does owe me, 
And he gives me a 
puff of his breath. 
He says he is tired of mashing, 
The girl that he had acted queer, 
Be searched for her all over Blackwell's Island. 
And he found her with a 
ball and chain on her 
CHORUS: 
Then cheer up old Gauger Pill-garlic, 
Brace up and get full of stale beer, 
Join a 
circus, hire out as a 
toothpick, 
And sit on the sharp edge of a 
spear. 
Dennis Kearney is looking for labor, 
Parnell he's the ladies' fond dear; 
Old Ireland we'll never forget you, 
The country that we love most dear.

JANE RILEY'S ALWAYS DRY.

Air—John Riley's Always Dry. 
I 
have a 
tine old woman, Jane Riley, don't you see, 
I 
strike her with a 
feather, this Janey she loves me; 
Her throat is like a 
fountain, her honor she won't cry, 
But, you know, hiding all her faults, Jane Riley's 
always dry. 
CHORUS: 
Ginger ale, very stale, 
She would order my Danny to go out and Imy; 
I'm very stout, she would shout, 
I'll keep drinking rock and rye. 
Claret wine, gin so fine, 
She would land down the kettle on the table and cry 
My on Dan, fill the can, 
Her honor, Jane Riley's Dry. 
It's only very lately Jane Riley's nose got red, 
Sure neither paint or whitewash would whiten Janey's 
head. 
It's when I'm only rising, scarce opening my eye, 
I 
catch her sending out the boy, Jane Riley's always 
dry. 
Her mother often told me, when I 
was young and gay, 
The only thing to keep her still, was to let her have 
her way; 
You see I'm nearly looney, Just look you In my eye, 
'Tis a 
big drop of the cratur, Jane Riley's always dry.-'

Then I 
get drunk on cider, through the bunghole it was 
nice, 
I 
set a 
hen on snowballs to see her hatch out ice. 
I 
tried to ride a 
jackass, when he kicked me in the jaw, 
And you bet I

never saw before 
Just then old gcanny seized me, on her knee she made m_

And she busted ray suspenders, in that rocker by the waj,

Kaufman," 791 Broadway, New 
York. Sung with unbounded success by the Col-
ored Troubadours. 
Price, words and 
Music, 40 cents. 
I 
saw the dear old homestead, 
I 
saw it in a 
dream, 
I 
fancied I 
was gliding 
Along a 
rippling stream; 
Through sleeping waves and moonlight, 
I 
reached a 
pebbly strand, 
And bounding from my shallop, 
I 
stood upon the land. 
Cnonus. 
Oh, lovely, lovely picture, 
So life-like and so bright, 
I'll hide it in my memory, 
That dream of yester-night. 
I 
saw the dear old homestead, 
The evening meal was spread, 
The candles in the window 
A 
welcome lustre shed; 
My gray-haired sire and mother 
My eager eyes could trace, 
And sisters, too, and brothers, 
There was no vacant place. 
I 
lingered just a 
moment 
Outside the open door, 
Then forward sprang to greet them, 
And clasp their hands once more; 
But ere my heart had spoken 
Its fullness of delight, 
Alas! my dream was broken, 
My dream of yester-night. 
As sung by MR. STANLEY GREY with tremendous success, at the 
SAN FRANCISCO MINSTRELS. 
Last night I 
was dreaming of you, 
And bright happy moments gone by, 
We trod the old paths that we knew, 
Ere absence had caused us to sigh. 
Kind friends and companions were near, 
A 
merry and mirth-loving throng, 
With links of relationship dear, 
To bind us life's pathway along. 
I 
saw the sweet smile that you wore, 
As we gazed on the friends that we knew, 
I 
beard the same voice as of yore, 
That told of a 
bosom so true. 
And long did that pleasure remain, 
And joyous each spirit did seem— 
Oh vision return once again, 
Or quickly fulfilled be the dream.

Out of Employment. 
RECITATION. 
Written by DAN SULLY for Miss DAISY REMINGTON, and recited by he., 
with great success in the principal theatres. 
Out of employment, starvation in view, 
Now what has a 
poor man in my place to do? 
Weary I 
wander, careworn and sad, 
I'm looking for work, and there's none to be had. 
Choosing rather to die than to beg or to steal, 
The sharp pangs of hunger I 
try to conceal; 
Weary I 
wander, sadly I 
roam, 
To earn food for the little ones starving at home. 
Vain, vain are those tears, but still they will flow, 
To yield to despair is womanly, I 
know; 
I 
must choke down the lump which will rise in my throat, 
And strive to live on, though I 
have not a 
groat. 
Yes, I'll strive to live on, though again and again 
Does the mad thought of suicide flash through my brain; 
Dinnerless, supperless, still I 
must roam, 
To earn food for the little ones starving at home. 
Now, why should a 
man, be he Christian or Turk, 
Be doomed to such hardships while he's willing to work? 
For months I've becn wandering half crazed through 
your town, 
Till my strength is nigh gone and I'm quite broken down. 
Oh, God! it were better, perhaps, to be dead. 
For they won't give me work, and I 
can't beg my bread; 
No money, no work, sadly I 
roam, 
There's no help for the little ones starving at home. 
Go to Sleep my Little Darling. 
Published by permission of COLLINS & 
BUXTON, Portland, Me, 
Go to sleep, illy little darling, 
Rest on mother's loving breast, 
And the angels will protect you 
When within your cradle rest; 
Far above the starry heavens, 
They are looking down on you, 
So repose, my precious darling, 
Close your tiny eyes of blue. 
CHORUS. 
Go to sleep, my little darling, 
Rest your head on mother's breast, 
And the angels will protect you, 
When within your cradle rest. 
Far a-down the dewy meadow, 
All the daises are asleep, 
And the birdies in the branches 
Also are in slumber deep. 
But in Eden far above ns, 
Angel eyes are open wide, 
And you are as safe, my darling, 
/..s if they were at your side. 
Go 4t5 sleep Sr* 
In the early morning, earring. 
Little robin in the tree 
Will awake you from your slumber, 
When he sings his merry glee. 
Then I'll take you to my bosom, 
Till the glimmer on the plain 
Tells us that the sun is shining, 
ARAI the day iaas come again. 
Go to sleep, &c,

'Twas in the golden summer days 
We met beside the brook, 
The birds were singing happy lays 
In every shady nook. 
But sweeter far than songs of birds 
The gentle voice that fell, 
And what was told in whispered words 
I 
should not care to tell. 
'The birds were warbling everywhere, 
In summer's rosy glow, 
And loving lips were meeting there, 
Where pretty violets grow.

Twilight shades were in the sky 
Before we bade adieu; 
I 
heard a 
tender little sigh, 
And knew one heart was true. 
The little birds had gone to sleep, 
Soft dew-drops kissed the flowers, 
And never stars began to peep 
On h-.ppier hearts than ours. 
The birds were warbling everywhere, 
In summer's rosy glow, 
And loving lips were meeting there, 
Where pretty violets grow.
