Announcement. 
(First part of conversation is with Carl 
Beagle). 
Sand mining described throughout tape. 
G—Dorchester; 
38GT 
Carl & Chet started on the same day, but in two different 
places. 
Describes "screen," a large piece of machinery, with 
conveyor and screening drums that sorts out oversize grains. 
Describes thermal sand and its use by electric companies 
to 
insulate heat on buried high tension cables. 
Talks about function of screen. 
Equipment noise: 
large dump truck and screen. 
Drying foundry sand to 2 to 3% moisture. 
Different grades of sand found in different locations. 
How sand 
is dried via natural gas. 
Operation of screen described. 
(2.5 minutes) 
Shipping out by rail & truck. 
Wet screen described. It screens sand that doesn't need 
pre—drying, as does foundry sand. 
Baseball diamond sand is described. 
Differences in sands depend upon grade, clay content. 
Coarseness rated by A.F.S. numbers from 160 (very fine) to 20 
(gravel). 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel logs 
page 1 
Baseball diamond sand has high clay content and has 
topsoil added to 
it. 
They mix 
in the topsoil there. 
Foundry sand must have clay to hold its shape, and 
increase in coarseness, depending upon sizes of castings (so hot 
casting can "breathe") 
Electrical sand must be able to absorb heat from buried 
cables 
The redder the sand, the more clay is 
in 
it 
Company's research lab determines grades of sand. 
(5 minutes) 
Equipment noise. 
(Chester Riland appears on tape.) 
Discussion on whether Carl or Chet knows more about sand 
mining. 
Chet started at company 
in 1947, same year as Carl, but 
Carl started in upper New York State. 
Chet has had many jobs for the company. 
Used to run 
dipper shovels and front loaders, now drives a dump truck and is 
"at the tail end of my illustrious career." 
(7.5 minutes) 
Discussion of Chet's and Jens' heart surgery. 
Chet describes the use of a dragline to dig out sand and 
either put it 
in a truck or, 
if 
it's too wet, 
it's put in piles 
to dry out. 
Front loader loads it 
in trucks to be hauled to the 
drier or screen. 
Describes how they used to use augurs to determine locations 
of various sands and gravels. 
Removing trees and topsoil to reach sand. 
Now sand is sampled by an engine driven drill. 
Other plant has pumping operation. 
This plant only goes 
down about 30 feet with a dragline. 
Describes how pumping is done. 
(10 minutes) 
Introduces Ed Brown. 
Ed 
is the oldest employee -- 68 years old. 
Chet admires 
Ed's physique. 
Ed experienced with dredges. 
Ed: 
"Outside of this, I would rather pump sand than eat, 
and I like to eat." 
Ed brags about how he raises hundreds of 
tons a day for the company. 
Types of dredges: 
sucker pipes, chains, & revolving 
baskets. 
Cutter chains are the best. 
How chain dredge is operated -- best ones are hydraulic. 
(12.5 minutes) 
Describes control panel. 
Raising and lowering chains and pumps on a dredge. 
Signals from man watching dredge's output described: 
1 ring 
water, 2 = pump sand, 3 = ease off, 4 = get out. Now they have 
telephone line with button to push for rings. 
Sand gets from dredge to plant in a 10—inch pipe. 
At plant sand 
is sorted by a "classifier." 
Some classifiers 
can be set for any grade you want. 
All operated hydraulically. 
Classifiers' operations described. 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel logs 
page 2 
(15 minutes) 
Chet talks about Ed's experience with both dredges and 
dragline sand mining. 
Ed talks about 
equipment he has worked on, 
including dredge 
with sucker pipe cranked by hand. 
Talks about dangers of this 
equipment which injured operators' hands. 
Worked in a plant in 
Port Elizabeth who had the worst hand powered sucker pipe dredge. 
Talks about injuries sustained there. 
Best equipment is the 
later model which "has everything electric." 
Ed can't stand boring jobs, such as Chet has now. 
Has to 
have job where he's always doing something. 
Chet talks about how Ed hangs out with a younger crowd. 
Ed brags about having two broken necks. 
From here on we ride on down to the pits with Carl Beagle. 
Company has 4,000 acres of pits. 
Company has been around for 130 years. 
(17.5 minutes) 
Areas include screening area, 
loading area, shop, and pits. 
Other company properties nearby include dredging pits at Port 
Elizabeth G—Port Elizabeth; 
38GT. 
Saving topsoil for reclaiming. 
Secretary chimes in on CB about order for three tons of 
thermal sand. 
Influence of the economy on orders for sand. 
Company operates all year around 
Foundry sand consists of 
little tiny stones surrounded by a 
layer of clay, which form a bond. 
Clay sand 
is reddish. 
Thermal sand 
is much lighter in 
color. 
Thermal sand 
is much coarser and has a high stone 
content. 
(20 minutes) 
Sand's occurrence is caused by the glaciers of the Ice Age. 
Carl describes how glacier moved from Canada, and ground stone to 
make different grades of sand, which ranges from 2 to 15 feet 
d 
e 
e 
P 
Carl describes his satisfaction with slow pace of economic 
recovery, because "there's too much greed in this country." 
Started with two shifts and eighteen men seven years ago, 
now has one shift and five men. 
Each recession pared number 
down. 
Prefers to give his present men opportunity to work 
overtime. 
They're loading six days a week. 
Carl 
lives 
in Dorchester. 
His daughter runs office, and his 
wife runs the main office in Leesburg. 
All 
of Carl's family 
in 
sand business. 
(22.5 minutes) 
His father was sand miner in upstate New 
York and started Whitehead Bros.' operations there.

TXO1: 
Announcement, interview takes place in Port Republic, by 
Nacote Creek Harbor G—Port Republic; 13GT. 
Name pronounced 
anglicized, "von Bossy." 
Does boat repairing, but not 
boatbuilding. 
Mrs. !Jane? VonBosse is also carver, carves shore 
birds, human figures, "just about anything you can whittle out." 
Originally from Philadelphia, but grandfather lived in Seaside 
Heights, NJ. 
G—Seaside Heights; 
45GT Moved to Port Republic in 
1970. 
As a child he was befriended by two old market hunters 
G—Seaside Heights; 
45GT, who also carved their own decoys. 
"in 
the evening we used to sit around the fire at their place and 
watch 'em make decoys, and we'd pick up a piece o' 
wood and 
they'd show you how to shape out a head 'n' whittle which is 
something that most of the kids down in that area went duck 
hunting and most of them made their own decoys at that time." 
Teaches accounting and financing at Stockton State College. 
Has worked there since 1970. 
Was a v.pres. of Western Union 
International 
in N.Y.C. 
Is an accountant by trade, grad. of 
Drexel Univ. 
Also had his own accounting business & worked for 
other companies. 
Decoy carving described as a "sideline, a little more than a 
hobby." 
The VonBosse's operate a store in the house & go to 
about 6 shows a year. 
They carve to sell. 
Most sold right out 
of house. 
Best season is right after Labor Day, due to thoughts 
of 
impending Xmas, and arrival of birdwatchers at wildlife 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel logs 
page 4 
refuges nearby. 
Summer a bad season, people don't buy, but '83 
summer pretty good. 
Lot of carving & craft shows in the fall. 
(2.5 minutes) 
George Enderson and Bill Hauser of Seaside 
Heights were Seaside Heights premier carvers G—Seaside Heights; 
45GT and hunters. John Marder in Burlington made "real fine 
Delaware River decoys." 
Cramer & a bunch of people in West Creek 
were also fine carvers. 
G—Eagleswood; 
7 Saw people's birds and 
copied them. 
Many hunters used Harry Short's birds. 
Harry Short 
of Tuckerton G—Tuckerton; 
47GT was already dead back then, but he 
had carved 10,000 decoys, so many along Barnegat Bay area were 
using his decoys G—Barnegat Bay; 
42GT. 
Nobody collected decoys 
then; until the 1950s, 
decoys were only carved for hunting; 
collecting started after the 
'50s. 
Learned to appreciate decoys 
by how they looked and worked in the water, not as a collectors' 
item. 
Doesn't make his decoys "real fancy with feathers & all." 
Still carves them in 
"the old Jersey style," 
hollow, made from 2 
pieces of cedar hollowed out, "semi—round on the bottom. 
They 
just look good 
in the water and they're a good working—type 
decoy." 
Bodies made of white cedar, wood's lighter & more rot and 
weather resistant. 
Can be left in the water for a long time. 
Easy wood to shape, because soft. 
Usu. uses sugar pine for the 
heads. 
Pine a harder wood, needed 
'cause head "takes the 
beating for the decoy more than anything else., & you can carve 
more detail." 
Cedar not good for carving detail, 
'cause too 
grainy, will split if you carve too fine a line on 
it. 
Basswood 
the best wood for heads. 
Carves like soap, but very expensive. 
Jane V. uses basswood for the figures. 
Gets white cedar from Shire Bros. sawmill G—Egg Harbor; 05GT 
in Egg Harbor, their sawmill cuts only cedar for siding, 
fenceposts, etc. 
Cedar a good knot—free tree for decoy carvers. 
T.V. goes & picks up some every few weeks. Have to season a year 
for every inch thickness of the wood, to be dry enough to work 
with. 
Abbot's sawmill G—Waretown; 
53GT also cuts cedar G—Waretown; 
53GT, up 
in Waretown. 
3 or 4 sawmills just cut cedar. 
John Brown 
in Port Republic just cuts cedar G—Port Republic; 13GT. 
Good white 
cedar now just made into fence posts. 
T.V. thinks 
it a shame, 
good large cedar trees very scarce, as they are cut too soon to 
achieve size. 
White cedar a beautiful wood for boatbuilding and 
for decoys, it's perfect. 
(5 minutes) 
Carves a Barnegat style decoy, basically a low— 
tailed style decoy G—Barnegat Bay; 
42GT with a semi—round bottom, 
head rides up fairly high. When it's in the water, 2/3 of a 
duck's body is underwater. 
Duck a fairly heavy animal that 
floats low 
in the water. 
Plastic decoys float too high unless 
weighted. 
Don't look like a duck 
in the water. 
Wood is best 
material, also makes hunting decoys 
in cork. 
Can't get cedar in 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 5 
much beyond 6" width, but can get cork in any width. 
Lot of 
hunting decoys, especially for the bay, want a big oversize decoy 
that the ducks can see for a distance coming in. 
The bigger the 
decoy the easier it 
is for flying duck to see. 
Cork floats 
better than plastic, because it's denser. 
Not too many use cedar 
decoys for hunting because of the expense. 
Most cedar decoys 
bought only for decoration. 
T.V. uses only cork decoys for his 
hunting. 
There are a few people hunting with antique cedar 
decoys worth ca. $3-400 apiece. 
Won't sell them to collectors. 
Jimmy Dickinson, who docks his boat there, has a set of old 
decoys made by Harry Short. Has used them for years & will not 
part with them. 
Some people with money will occ. order a dozen 
cedars to use for hunting. 
$400 or so for a dozen of them. 
Plastic ones about $3 each. 
(7.5 minutes) 
Makes his mainly for collectors, doesn't 
weight them. 
Can be used for hunting if you put some lead 
in 
them. 
G—Nacote Creek; 13GT 
Is making some black duck decoys, which have stained body & 
painted head, stained body has color of black duck, and grain 
shows up 
like feathers. 
Gets $45 apiece. 
Black duck decoys in 
demand because of their beauty. 
People buy mallards because of 
familiarity. 
Wood ducks bought for their beauty. 
Ducks he 
likes 
-- ring necks and gadwalls [?] -- don't sell because people don't 
know them. 
Admires sea ducks, bluebills, scaups [?], and 
canvasbacks, & redheads as beautiful, but people don't buy 
because of unfamiliarity. 
These species don't winter in area 
since celery & eelgrass died. 
In Chesapeake Bay area, people at 
shows buy them & other diving ducks, as they're native to that 
area. 
Makes a hell 
of a lot of black ducks & mallards, as they 
sell best. 
J.V. makes lots of different types of duck 
miniatures. 
Birdwatchers know species. (animal), arts and crafts, 
wood, marketing. 
TX02: 
G—Port Republic; 13GT 
Hunters tend to know only black 
ducks, as they winter there 
in great numbers. 
Early morning & 
late afternoon best times for duck hunting, anything painted 
black works for then. 
Ducks can't differentiate color, more 
attracted to way it swims. 
White will attract sea ducks, such as 
buffleheads [?], redheads, or canvasbacks. 
Mallards will stool 
with just about anything. 
(10 minutes) Has done more hunting with a camera than with a 
gun, but likes to get out there every day. 
Likes to eat ducks. 
The limit this year will be one duck, because black ducks 
declining. 
Will then photo a lot since 1 duck doesn't make a day 
of hunting. 
Conservation authorities encouraging the hunting of 
snow geese, as they're becoming pests, tearing up spartina [?] 
grass by the roots. 
Snow geese can clean out a marsh to bare 
mud, so 
it takes 5 years to recover, destroying a lot of cover 
for the smaller ducks. 
In Federal refuges 40% can be zoned for 
hunting, so much snow geese hunting in Brigantine Refuge. 
Most 
Lund--$3 Reel—to—reel logs 
page 6 
locals will be going out for snow geese. 
Young snow geese good, 
old ones have to be marinated in good wine marinade, only meat on 
them is 
legs and breast. 
They feed well , on good grass. 
Best 
duck is canvasback, which feeds on wild celery. 
Next best flavor 
is wood duck, but he doesn't kill them because of their scarcity. 
Wood ducks not found in marshes, but in ponds 
in woods. 
Black 
duck very good when he first comes down, but later he gets fishy 
from feeding on snails. 
Almost any duck good. 
Sea ducks, which 
feed on fish, have a fishy flavor only if marinated overnight. 
Even crows are good to eat if you cook them right. 
Blackbirds & 
blue jays also good 
if cooked right. hunting, (foodways). 
G—Nacote Creek; 13GT 
(12.5 minutes) Canvasbacks 100—point ducks with a limit of 
one. 
A neighbor & his friend shot 2 canvasbacks up on the 
Mullica River. 
Used to be a lot of canvasbacks in Barnegat when 
there was a lot of eelgrass & wild celery in n. part of Barnegat 
Bay, but when they cut through the Manasquan Canal, 
it 
let 
in too 
much salt water in n. of bay, killed all celery which prefers 
brackish water. 
Birds come depending upon availability of feed. 
Bay has changed, become polluted, but eelgrass starting to come 
back. 
Approves state & Federal regulations, as there's always 
something to hunt. Has to be some hunting as there's no predators 
& some animals (such as deer) become too numerous. 
(15 minutes) 
Pollution harming habitat in north, so 
less 
hunting needed. 
His friend, Doc Conover, dentist in Absecon, his 
father & grandfather were market hunters. In old days they'd go 
out & kill 
100-150 ducks at a time & sell them, but there were 
thousands then. 
There are still a few "game—hogs," who go out & 
slaughter anything in sight, but most people are more interested 
in the hunt itself, than 
in killing anything. 
TX03: 
Describes how he makes a decoy. G—Nacote Creek; 13GT 
Sawmill cuts cedar in 2x6" to whatever length the log happens to 
be. 
Takes 2 pieces, 1 for top, 1 for bottom, & hollows them out 
with a drill, then pegs them together, roughs out body shape on a 
band saw. 
Some old timers can rough it out with a hatchet on a 
chopping block. 
Harry Shourds down in Seaville can rough out 2 
decoys G—Seaville; 
36GT with a hatchet in the time H.V. can do 1 
with a band saw. 
arts and crafts, technology, wood. 
Gouges them out with a fusener bit on a drill press to make 
them hollow. 
This makes it lighter & keeps it from checking. 
Then glued back together & ready to shape up. 
Puts it 
in a vise 
& shapes it with a drawknife & smoothes it with a spokeshave. 
Rasps 
it with a Stanley rasp. 
Then sands it. 
Has several 
patterns for both heads & bodies. 
Cuts head rough out of 2" pine 
& then whittles it down with a knife. 
Takes him about 1 hr. to 
make a head. 
Body & rest of 
it takes about 1 1/2 hr. 
Takes 3 
hrs. for woodwork & about 1 hr. to paint it, 
so takes about 4 
hrs. total 
to make a decoy. 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel logs 
page 7 
(17.5 minutes) 
Mallard takes longer, as because of colors 
it takes about 2 hrs. to paint. 
Usu. paints 6 at a time. 
Prefers acrylic paint because of 
its lack of shine. 
Decoys can't 
have a shine or they don't attract ducks. 
Decorative ducks are 
waxed after painting. 
Can't get good colors for decoy painting. 
Only company that made them was Herter's in Minnesota. 
Acrylic 
paint holds up well, better than oil. 
Has to mix up own colors. 
Doesn't prime decoys, so paint sinks into wood, & so white 
doesn't show through 
if they're chipped. 
Occ. uses a dark brown 
primer, 
if painting a lot of detailed feathers. 
Cork ducks are 
charred with a blowtorch & that gives them a good black—duck 
coloring. They're then finished with Tungseal floor—sealer. 
(20 minutes) Correct colors important only for people, not 
for ducks. 
Plenty of others make purely decorative ducks, but he 
makes them to 
look 
like decoys. 
Neighbor, George Diener, started 
with decoys & shore birds, now does individual feather insertion, 
took 3rd prize down 
in Salisbury, MD. 
Geo. sells them for $3-400 
apiece, spends maybe 2 weeks on one. 
Fred Wrightmeyer, across 
the creek makes a really fine decoy. 
His grandfather , Carl 
Adams was a fine boatbuilder G—Port Republic; 
13GT, built "finest 
Jersey sea skiffs." 
Also 2 or 3 of the party boats down at 
Oyster Creek were built by Carl G—Oyster Creek; 09GT out of cedar & 
oak. 
Fred makes an old fashioned hollow style. 
Gary Giberson 
down at the Noyes Museum makes some of the finest decoys 
G—Smithville; 
09GT in the U.S. 
Has a demonstration shop. 
His 
family has sawmill G—Port Republic; 
13GT up 
in Port Republic. 
Does 
it old fashioned way, chopping them out on a block. 
John Schueler from May's Landing does a purely decorative, 
museum—quality decoy G—May's Landing; 
10GT, with every feather 
carved. 
Has sold pieces for X18-20-25,000. 
Carves 2 a year. 
Tony Rudicel 
[?] of West Atlantic City won "best in the world" 
contest for decorative carving at Salisbury, MD. decoy G—West 
Atlantic City = Oceanville; 
89GT. 
T.V. considers Schueler the 
best in the world for fancy decorative carving. 
Schueler started 
in the 1950s, when he went duck hunting & carved himself a dozen 
cedar decoys. 
"The challenge is there to make nicer & nicer & 
fancier & fancier stuff 
if you want to, 
if you're workin' with 
wood." 
The piece that Rudicel won the prize on was a carving of 2 
surf scooters standing on a rock. 
(25 minutes) 
Today there's a tremendous market for 
woodcarving.

Eldora United Methodist Church just had its centennial 
celebration the previous Sunday. Beebe describes local 
lake as 
Pickle Factory Lake. 
New residents have changed its name to 
Lakeview Lake. 
Road is called Pickle Factory Road, used to be 
called Paper Mill Road. 
Talks about Hand's Mill Rd. from Delmont 
to Belleplain. On Cedar Lake there used to be Hand's Mill where 
they used to grind flour. 
Beebe 
is a full—time N.J. state 
conservation officer. Deputy conservation officers are 
volunteers. 
Frank Warfle is a deputy conservation officer. They 
call

their "eyes." "The more 'eyes' you have, the more help you have, 
the less you lose 
in your case."

Before that he was a member of the 
Atlantic Co. Fish & Game Detective Association. 
Has been

law 
enforcement since he was 18. He patrols the southern six counties 
of New Jersey -- Camden, Atlantic, Gloucester, Cumberland, Salem, 
and Cape May. 
2.5 minutes: 
Mostly troubleshoots and fills in for other 
officers. (Mrs. Beebe hands me a Xerox of an article about the 
Philadelphia Pickling Co.'s pickle factory on Pickle Factory

Area has quite a bit of trapping, mostly in Salem,

muskrats, and

knowledgeable trappers G—Maurice River Twp.] 
in the area is 
Lynwood Veach, who was also an eeler and a net fisherman, who

He 
is the most knowledgeable guy

At Reeds Beach, you can see 
the crabbers going in and out. On the highway where Sluice Creek 
crosses the highway, there's a dock where crabbers G—Sluice Creek; 
35GT put in. 
Most of the legal hunting G—Dennis Twp.] 
in the immediate 
area consists of solitary small game hunting and deer hunting in 
hunting clubs. 
Quite a few deer hunting clubs close by. 
Down on 
the highway is the East Creek Club G—Eldora; 34GT. There are are 
also the clubs of South Millville, the Good Sports of Banatico

Counties. 
Hunt clubs in area G—Dennis Twp.] G—Maurice River Twp.] 
G—Port Elizabeth; 38GT go out as a group, 40 or 50 guys. 
There 
is 
a campground at Port Elizabeth that they use. Have 30 or so 
"drivers," the rest are "standers" (the men who do the actual 
shooting). The "drivers" "whack 'em up" and drive them through 
for the "standers" to shoot. Some clubs will cut your shirttail

Right now is the bow hunting season. 
15 min.: Small game season comes in next, then the regular deer 
season comes in the first week of December. Then there's a 
special farmers' permit season, and a muzzle loaders' season. 
There may be too much deer killing going on right now. 
Since there is such good deer hunting in the area, the 
poachers G—Dennis Twp.] are "going steady." Any given night in 
Eldora, you can hear the shots of the poachers G—Eldora; 34GT. At 
night when he 
leaves his bedroom windows open, he can hear the 
guns going off once 
in a while. 
Up at the crossroads there's 
often poaching G—Eldora; 34GT going on. 
Describes places nearby 
where 5 to 7 "nice' bucks have been gotten. 
Poachers G—Dennis 
Twp.] will certainly get some of them before the firearm deer 
season opens. 
Some poachers are local guys. 
They just say, 
"I 
carry my money in my pocket. 
when you catch me I'll pay .... Some 
of them don't have no hard feelings against you and some of 
'em 
do." It's a game for many of them. "They just try to say, 
'Well I 
got so many deer on of Beeb',' you know." 
Roads nearby have 
graffiti about Beebe painted on them. "Beebe got 20 deer with our 
dogs," "Beebe takes a hundred dollar bribe," "Beebe, you better 
retire," are some examples. 
poaching. 
17.5 min.: 
Some poachers sell carcasses. 
For most it's just a

Some guys, he's caught 8 or 9 times, and "I don't know how 
in the hell to stop 'em." 
Some people it doesn't worry him if

they get a deer G—Dennis Twp.], because he knows they killed it to 
eat 
it. Beebe was born and raised 
in the country in the cranberry 
bogs. 
His father made $8 a week and got free rent and firewood. 
"When he wanted a deer, he went and got it and brought it home 
and we ate 
it, 
and to this day that's my all 
belief. 
But when 
they go to saloons and they brag up and they're sellin' 
'em, well 
then it's time to try to catch 'em and put the halt on 'em." 
Some judges are cooperative, others not especially if the 
attorneys are their "favorite sons." 
law enforcement. 
20 min.: 
"Killin' a deer in our field is just like a homicide." 
It used to be that killing a rabbit was more of crime than 
running a stop sign. Small game hunting G—Maurice River Twp.] 
G—Dennis Twp.] 
in area is mostly rabbit, grouse, quail. Grouse 
mostly found in swampy areas. 
Back road near him has a 
substantial supply of grouse G—Eldora; 34GT. 
Only a very good 
hunter can nail grouse in the woods, because of the way they head 
up 
in the trees and dart around, not letting you get a good shot. 
A pheasant goes straight up before he 
levels off, and 
is thus 
easier to shoot. 
Rabbit hunting G—Maurice River Twp.] G—Dennis 
Twp.] used to be very good, but in 
last few years has been poor. 
(animal). 
22.5 min.: 
Fox hunting in area G—Maurice River Twp.] G—Dennis 
Twp.] 
is rarely legitimate. It 
is mostly a ruse for deer 
poaching. 
When you catch them with illegal Magnum-4's, they 
always claim to be hunting fox. 
You have to catch them with the 
deer, 
in order to arrest them. 
22.5 min.: 
There are about 2 or 3 real 
"fox chasers" G—Maurice 
River Twp.] G—Dennis Twp.] 
in the area. Them they know are 
legitimate. Others they know that whenever they leave their 
house, they're going deer poaching, but they claim to be fox 
hunting. 
These guys run dogs, but they're really poaching deer. 
Beebe calls their dogs "deer dogs," although they call them "fox 
hounds." There are also 'coon hunters in area. Their dogs bay up 
the trees. Trapping G—Maurice River Twp.] G—Dennis Twp.] in area is 
mostly muskrat, some fox. 
Anybody who sets a trap other than the 
property owner or the lessee, has to have his name tag on the 
trap. 
If property is not posted, you do not need to get 
permission from the landowner to trap on 
it 
25 min.: 
Much muskrat trapped on the meadowlands of Cumberland 
and Cape May Counties. 
Local dealers buy the furs, and bigger 
dealers come through occasionally to buy from them. 
Furs taken 
to New York or Philadelphia to big fur dealers. 
Big fur

in Alloway. 
Local fur buyers G—Maurice River Twp.] G—Dennis Twp.] also do some

Creek; on ocean side, watercourse is Cedar Swamp Creek, which 
drains the Great Cedar Swamp. Great Cedar Swamp has been a good 
source of cedar, because it's wet all 
the time, which 
is 
important for cedar. "Cedar doesn't like to get its feet dried 
out. 
It likes to stay wet." 
Much of 
it 
is now cut off, but 
there's young cedar coming up at the piece that was burned in the 
forest fire of 1944. "That's a beautiful piece of cedar." 
Since 
WWII, most cut off, but coming back, but it's being badly hurt by 
salt intrusion. 
Drought about 10 years ago, several years with 
almost no rainfall, not enough freshwater pressure, led to 
saltwater intrusion killed much of the swamp down by the

35GT, 36GT was young, ca. 40 years old. Most bought in 
late 1940s, 
early 1950s. 
Should be 70 or 80 years old when cut. Held land 
for maybe 15 years before logging it. 
Some land would have both 
mature & immature timber on 
it. George, Sr. owned much of the 
Great Cedar Swamp at one time. 
After 
logging it, 
he sold much 
of his cut—over land to a "sand wash" named Petinas, who now 
wants to get rid of 
it. 
Mostly sold after being 
cut off, 
because of taxes. 
When the land was bought, taxes were ca. 
10 
cents per acre, now ca. $6 to $9 per acre, not worth keeping 
after timber cut off. 
Pay more taxes in a lifetime than you'd 
ever make from it. 
"Really, except for the timber, only thing 
it's good for is to hold the world together, that and of course 
the 
land as a whole, 
it's a good water source." 
Value to 
its 
owner is just as a timber source. Can't be developed, too wet, 
if 
it wasn't for decayed vegetation, 
it'd be a lake.

3 problems with cedar G—Great Cedar Swamp; 34GT, 35GT, 36GT in 
area. 
1. Salt intrusion, only salt loving plants grow in some 
areas now, & cedar does not tolerate salt. 2. Too much deciduous 
brush in swamp,so when cedar cut, new seedlings can't compete 
with suckers put out by brush. ("Cedar comes up 
like hair on a 
dog's back.") 3. Biggest problem is damage to seedlings by winter 
feeding deer. Although deer don't like cedar, they feed on 
it 
when there isn't any other green. 
They nip the top off, but they 
do 
it so that competing brush gets head start on 
it, 
so you have 
4 or 5—foot brush. 
Some areas have 100% brush now, but if this 
doesn't happen, then when sun hits cut—over area, "the cedar it 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel logs 
page 27 
comes up 
like grass. 
It's unbelievable the amount of cedar that 
sprouts. It can't take the deer and 
it can't take the competition 
from the maples and so on." (animal). 
"Cedar will grow on extremely sour soil that other things 
won't grow on, and so it doesn't have competition and 
it goes 
ahead and grows." As nutrients in soil 
increase, other 
competitive plants increase as well. First of these is swamp 
maple; as 
it 
improves more you get sweet and sour gum, then, 
especially if you're next to a field getting runoff, you start 
getting oak.

is the 
absence of 
limestone. Maple 
grows most anywhere cedar will, but 
then gum likes 
it a little sweeter, poplar likes 
it a little 
sweeter, and oak after that. 
There's also hollys, magnolias, and 
sassafras in cedar swamp, but they don't compete. 
The maple do 
though, especially if they're cutting cedar & cut down maple --
sends up suckers due to established root system. It's better to 
let maple stand isolated 
& wait for windstorm to fell 
it. 
That 
way you don't get suckers. It kills it. 
Pop (George, Sr.) once 
tried girdling maples but they merely put up suckers below the 
girdles. Many places where they have cut cedar, 
later the maples 
will blow over. 
Cutting one off just sends up a whole ring of 
suckers.

Pop (George, Sr.) had tried thinning G—Dennisville; 34GT 
G—Great Cedar Swamp; 34GT, 35GT, 36GT cedar back 
in early 1950s or 
late 1940s, when he owned cedar stands by the town. He tried to 
cut the bean pole sized cedar out from among the 50 or 60—year— 
old (Cedar comes up thick and thins itself with the strongest 
predominating, weaker ones die as they are crowded.) 
Thinning, cedar, bean pole. 
20 min. 
In this case the weak ones were still crowded, but hadn't 
died yet, so he decided to let somebody go 
in there and cut them 
out for posts and rails. G—Dennisville; 34GT G—Great Cedar Swamp; 
34GT, 35GT, 36GT 
Young George, Jr. went there to out bean poles. 
It was fine until the next time they got a big snowstorm, at 
which time the standing cedar bent to the ground, because their 
support removed. Thought they were going to 
lose them, but they 
did come back up. 
That's when they get "boxy timber" which 
is 
dense wood that closes up on the saw. Tree blows over & then 
rights itself. 
To right itself it creates "compressed wood," 
that's what "boxy wood" 
is. 
10 or 15 years later when that 
timber was cut, you could see kink, and all 
had a streak of "boxy 
wood."

In most logging, you go 
in and cull timber for firewood, but 
you can't do that with cedar, at least not in areas where you get 
big snowstorms. This kinked cedar was not suitable for TV poles 
(poles that used to be used for TV antennas). 
Cedar, snowstorms. 
22.5 min. 
Scattered cedar G—Great Cedar Swamp; 34GT, 35GT, 36GT, not in a 
clump, 50% of the time , when brought in to the mill 
it will be 
"shook," which means that the tree has been twisted and windblown 
so hard that it has cracks in 
it. 
When you saw a board, 
it will 
fall 
in half. 
If you hear of straw driven through a tree 
in a 
tornado, what has happened, 
is that the storm has twisted & 
cracked the tree, and the straw was blown into the crack, which 
then closed up on 
it. 
"Shook trees" are broken up and often end 
up being trash. A local woodcarver G—North Dennis; 34GT buys 
George's scrap & makes little souvenirs out of it. Woodcarver is 
Joe Robinson, and he operates the Little Village Flower Shop in 
North Dennis. 
Also makes clocks.

Woodcarver G—North Dennis; 34GT has made many things. Cuts, 
sands, burns, & then epoxys his stuff. 
[At this point, George 
showed me a whale—shaped clock. 
George has a number of whale 
oriented decorations in his house. at another time, he told me 
that his family takes vacations where they go out in whale 
observation boats. 
He 
is obviously a "whale buff."]

describes woodburned plaques that the North Dennis woodcarver 
makes. 
Also makes decoupage.

Cedar slabs G—Dennisville; 34GT G—Cedar Brook; 41GT sold to an 
outfit in Cedar Brook to make play houses. 
His scrap is sold 
through the Acme Markets bundled as kindling G—Cedar Brook; 
41GT. Other sawmill trash 
hauled back into the swamp to help build 
up the road. 
Have to build a corduroy road to get in and out of 
the swamp. G—Great Cedar Swamp; 34GT, 35GT, 36GT Sawdust 
G—Dennisville; 34GT used as bedding for horses. 
Red cedar is 
supposed to keep moths out of closet. 
Robert Brewer: "Ticks don't 
like white cedar." Some sawdust used for mulch. Very little 
actually 
thrown away. 
"Our sawmill G—Dennisville; 34GT is very 
elementary. It's about as simple as you can get." 
Only difference 
is that George, Jr. has some power equipment for handling the logs 
that George, Sr. didn't. 
Mill G—Dennisville; 34GT is no further 
advanced than those available in early 1900s. 
Diesel powered, 
though earlier ones were steam. New automated mills don't suit his 
purposes. Everything cut on head saw. 
Have no resaws or other 
modern stuff. 
With too much investment, you'd have to run 
a lot 
more material through to make 
it pay, & there's not that much 
available. There's one larger cedar sawmill 
in Shire 
(Devonshire?) in Atlantic Co. He supplied cedar shingles and 
siding G—Shire (probably Devonshire); 12GT for State's restoration 
in Batsto. 
Guy named Jack Abbott near Hammonton has a bigger 
cedar sawmill G—Hammonton; 11GT. used to be a fellow named Clear in 
Weymouth who had a bigger sawmill G—Hamilton; 10GT.

Never tried to cut a lot, both Pop (George, Sr.) and he made 
"decent living" from it. 
More or less just cut custom orders. 
Have started building large numbers of picnic tables. 
Have been 
many camping grounds established in area 
in the past 15 years. 
George has one. Now he builds lots of picnic tables. 
In some 
years, he has built 2-3,000 picnic tables. Growth of camping 
ground industry has slowed down. Now makes 7-800 picnic tables 
per year. 
For tables uses lower quality cedar G—Dennisville; 34GT, 
such as side lumber, small 
logs, 2x4s, etc. Good lumber of heart 
cedar for cedar siding, 6 & 8—inch clapboard, boat lumber, big 
planks for oyster boats G—Maurice River; 38GT, you can sell 
all 
you 
can get hold of, but you can't sell all 
the 2x4s or posts you can 
make. 
Picnic tables have increased market for that stuff. 
Sell 
a lot of 
lumber for decking and docks. Breezy Marina in Cape May 
just put in a 700 ft. x 6 ft. floating dock for which Brewer 
supplied the lumber. 
Cedar, side lumber, 
logs, 2x4s, heart cedar, siding, clapboard, 
boat lumber, planks, oyster boats, posts, decking, docks, wood. 
5 min. 
Many other mills have gone into business making prefab 
fence. He hasn't done it. 
Sells lumber G—Dennisville; 34GT so 
people can build their own fences. As cedar gets scarce, the 
prefab stockade fences use cedar only for the boards, treated 
pine, sometimes just building wood for rest of fence & that won't 
hold up. Often Canadian cedar for boards, but just nailed on to 
construction lumber for rails. Bought a fence downtown and the 
2x3s on 
it were just construction lumber, which won't stand up to 
the weather. Treated pine decking has cut into cedar sales. 
Doesn't sell much cedar decking anymore. Treated pine is only 2/3 
the price of cedar, and may last as 
long, but it splinters 
dangerously due to curling as 
it dries. 
Pine boardwalks 
dangerous. 
Pop (George, Sr.) sold much cedar for boardwalks 
G—Ocean Gate; 42GT to the Town of Ocean Gate. Everything above 
Atlantic Co. 
is Central Jersey to the folks down there (in 
Dennisville). They liked cedar G—Dennisville; 34GT G—Ocean Gate; 
42GT because it wore down smooth without splinters. 
It was a 
boardwalk just for local 
residents. 
Used cedar for years. 
Lumber, cedar, boardwalk. 
7.5 min. 
Right now George's sawmill G—Dennisville; 34GT has only one 
employee, used to always have two, but one fellow retired about a 
year ago & not replaced, due to lack of business. 
Bought 
equipment to 
load logs 
in swamp G—Great Cedar Swamp; 34GT, 35GT, 
36GT with, so now doesn't need third man. 
May go back to 3, 
if they 
get busier. 
Work 12 months of year, but busiest in spring, due 
to demand for picnic tables by camp grounds opening for season. 
People in resort areas want new docks or new decks then too. 
Slowest season is December, maybe January. Last year a man 
in 
Cumberland Co. putting in greenhouses ordered lots of cedar for 
benches and frames. Prefers to cut in winter to summer, as then 
fewer bugs and heat. 
Would rather take summers off, that's why 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel logs 
page 31 
he's started the camp ground, so he could .just work that in 
summer. 
Sawmill, 
log, cedar. 
10 min. 
Weather is most important factor deciding when they work. 
You would generally spend 3 days 
in woods for 2 days 
in sawmill 
but weather or equipment breakdowns generally get in the 
way.Years ago, when cutting right outside of town would cut a 
load of cedar in morning, and mill them in afternoon. 
Now he's 
so far out in swamp G—Great Cedar Swamp; 34GT, 35GT, 36GT that it 
takes all 
day just to get logs. For years, they used to out 
"feather edge," G—Dennisville; 34GT (a piece of 
lumber 9/16" on one 
side, tapered to nothing on the other, & about 3 1/2" wide, used 
to put feather edges on houses & cover with asphalt siding. 
Used 
to cut timber in morning, cut up 
in afternoon, & work feather 
edge at night. Called "feather edge"or "horsefeathers." 
Made 
them by hundreds of thousands of bundles all 
over South Jersey. 
Was a man named Geiversen (spelling?) who went around & set up 
people with crosscut saw and table saws, having them buy cedar 
already cut & then he'd buy the feather edges from them. 
This 
was "a crime," because much of that cedar was of too good a 
quality to be used for that. 
Sawmill, cedar, swamp, feather edge, mill, wood, architecture, 
technology. 
12.5 min. 
A man on Weymouth Road named Steelman was cutting up good 
cedar G—Weymouth; 11GT for feather edge. This was a waste, as 
it 
should have been used for shingles. A really good piece of cedar 
has a lot of heartwood. A tree grows clear wood after the limbs 
have dropped off. 
Knots are 
limbs. 
Clear wood is wood that has 
grown on the trunk of the tree after the limbs have dropped off, 
which takes an old tree. 
Cedar growing in crowded condition is 
usually clean, as 
limbs drop off sooner. 
Trees in open area, the 
limbs stay on producing knotty wood. 
Knots are O.K. for 
paneling. It was "a crime" to see such large clean wood cut up 
for feather edge G—Weymouth; 11GT. 
George, Sr. used to give 
George, Jr. a hard time because their feather edge G—Dennisville; 
34GT didn't look as nice as Steelman's feather edge G—Weymouth; 
11GT. George, Jr. couldn't convince him that you could never make 
beautiful feather edge from knotty, sappy tops that they were 
using. At the end of WWII, guy named Elkton Birch (spelling?) in 
Atlantic County was making feather edge on a bench saw and 
getting $1.25 per bundle for it. 
Last feather edge G—Dennisville 
34GT Brewers sold to Geiversen (spelling?), he wanted to pay 95 
cents; 
in mid or late 1950s, there were so many people set up 
with little sawmills, that you couldn't "make wages." 
Cedar, feather edge, shingles, heartwood, clear wood, paneling.

Brewers were making feather edge G—Dennisville; 34GT to get 
rid of the poor stuff not good enough for lumber, but picnic

page 32 
table business's demand for lots of 2x4s for legs, they went over 
to that. 
When he and father first were in business, only 6" or 
larger lumber saleable, stuff like 2x6s & boat lumber. Was no 
market for smaller stuff & poorer quality then. Hasn't run the 
feather edge mill for 5 years, because of picnic table trade. 
Uses that mill as a storage shed. 
Used to cut a special 
3/8"0"x6—foot slat which was shipped down to Salisbury, Maryland 
and used as a frame for shading azaleas. 
Sent truckloads of them 
down there. 
This also got rid of smaller, 
low quality stuff, but 
didn't really make money other than wages. 
Probably sold close 
to $100,000 worth of stuff, with never a signed slip or meeting 
the guy 
in person. 
A truckload of that stuff ran ca. $2500-3000. 
Feather edge, 
lumber, 2x4s, 2x6s, boat lumber, feather edge mill. 
17.5 min. 
This shows difference between business in South Jersey from 
business in North Jersey. 
South Jersey more casual. 
You can get 
burned, but he's only gotten 3 bad checks over the years, 
although he takes personal checks. 
People coming with cash, he 
tells them to bring a check next time. 
2 of the bad checks are 
from the same guy, & the other is from a school that "went 
under." 
If you want cedar to come up, 
it's good to have a fire in 
the swamp G—Great Cedar Swamp; 34GT, 35GT, 36GT to kill the maple, 
holly & brush, and then the cedar has an equal chance. 
Cedar 
will then sometimes get too thick. 
There's a piece that burned 
in 1944 or 1945, you can see 
it from the highway. It has gotten 
very high & is a solid black—green mass. It's so thick you can 
hardly walk through it, 
but it can get too thick so it doesn't do 
well. 
Cedar, fire, maple, holly, (plant). 
20 min. 
Much of the cedar he has cut probably result of a fire 
G—Great Cedar Swamp; 34GT, 35GT, 36GT G—Woodbine; 37GT in 
late 
1800s. Swamps were extremely dry because fire started near Woodbine 
probably by steam engine on the railroad & headed for shore by 
Rte. 9. 
A man got 
in his carriage to go warn people on the other 
side of the Great Cedar Swamp, but fire beat him there. 
Occasionally they still find a charred trunk from that fire. That 
was the big fire. 
In some places, 
it burned the turf causing 
cedar to grow where it hadn't been before. Burning of the turf 
kills the competition. Lots of baby cedar come up 
in the swamp, 
lots more than you would ever plant if you were reforesting. 
Cedar, fire, swamp. 
22.5 min. 
Control of forest fires in modern times has hurt cedar's 
chances for growing. 
Swamp that has been cut off 
in 
last 20 
years, 
if there was a fire, 
it would all 
come up 
in cedar. 
There's a piece nearby called Burnt Causeway which was cut off 
in 
late 1940s, for years it was just brush, now some cedar G—Great

I 
Cedar Swamp; 34GT G—Burnt Causeway; 34GT is coming back, but the 
piece of 
it that was burned is now solid cedar. 
Nearby piece 
has other growth, such as maple. 
He knows of a place called 
"Sacktown," where his father cut cedar G—Great Cedar Swamp; 34GT, 
35GT, 36GT G—Sacktown or Greenfield, part of Seaville; 36GT, where 
no cedar came back, probably due to deer. 
George, Sr. called it 
"Sacktown," but it's also called "Greenfield." 
Forest fire, cedar, swamp, maple, deer, (plant), (animal). 
25 min. 
There's also a little community G—Squeedunk; 34GT on King's Highway 
called "Squeedunk," between South Seaville and Clermont, probably 
part of Clermont. 
(Gives directions to King's Highway and 
Squeedunk.) Robert: Aunt Sandy lives in Clermont. There's a place 
on the edge of the swamp G—Great Cedar Swamp; 34GT, 35GT, 36GT 
called "A Horse Hung Himself." There's another area called 
"Buzzard's Clump." George, Sr. always called an area outside of 
Seaville, on Rte. 50, just north of town, "Sacktown."

Place near where he cuts cedar G—Great Cedar Swamp; 34GT, 35GT, 
36GT G—Laurel City; 36GT, 
is called Laurel City. (While I was 
changing the tape, son Robert referred to the fact that the area 
is called "Laurel City" by "the Pineys," a little west of 
Sacktown or Greenfield. 
A former town just west of his camp

George, Sr. was a fanatic about the woods & spend most of 
his weekends walking in them, thereby discovering many good cedar 
G—Great Cedar Swamp; 34GT, 35GT, 36GT stands. He also liked to go to 
record office to trace titles. 
Much of the land 
in the swamp is 
of unknown ownership. 
The swamp G—Dennisville; 34GT G—Great Cedar 
Swamp; 34GT, 35GT, 36GT just outside Dennisville had the best prime 
cedar, which was worth 
a lot of money, so property lines and 
ownership well established. 
Area where they are now G—Great Cedar 
Swamp; 36GT would be unknown but for the presence of electric co. 
highlines as a reference point. 
That land was bought by George, 
Sr. about 10 or 15 years ago. 
He's almost done cutting it now. 
They use an old map that shows the woods roads relative to the 
property lines to find places. 
In most areas you would have to 
survey before cutting. A small clump of cedar where they are 
would cost more to survey than the cedar would be worth. 
If 
it 
were on somebody else's property, they would have to prove it & 
it 
isn't enough to be worth proving. "I don't know. 
We think 
we're right and hope we're right, but you know you're probably 
closer than a 100 feet of being right one way or another." 
Down 
here 
in town 
in the prime cedar G—Dennisville; 34GT G—Great Cedar 
Swamp; 34GT, 35GT, 36GT, 
lines are marked with stones. 
Swamp, cedar. 
7.5 
min. 
George, Sr. came in 1944 & was active until about 1975. 
Knew more about property lines & land ownership than anyone 
George, Jr. had ever met. 
Had a very good memory & easily picked 
up information. 
Land not worth keeping after it's logged out. 
He's paying taxes on 
land now that's not worth it. May let 
it go 
for tax sale or donate it to a wildlife preservation group & get 
an 
income tax deduction. 
Now Pinelands Reserve has clouded value 
of everything. 
His camp ground was 
worth $400-500,000 before 
Pinelands, now it's worth less than $10,000, due to restrictions 
on development. "That's about the only rights you have is 
to pay 
taxes." 
George, Sr. sold a lot of cut—over land to a sand 
washing co. named Petinas (spelling?). 
He's now trying to unload 
the 
land, too. 
Petinas approached Mattolucci (spelling?) Bros., 
sand wash G—Great Cedar Swamp; 34GT, 35GT, 36GT to get them to buy 
it. 
Nobody'd want it, except for the timber every 80 or 100 
years. 
It 
is valuable as a water resource, but everybody gets 
benefit of that. 
Logging, sand washing, timber, water, wood, government. 
10 min. 
An 
individual owner doesn't get any benefits from this land. 
people do buy tax 
liens on it, 
though. 
Most of 
it ends up 
belonging to State or township. 
Every 10 G—Dennisville; 34GT or 20 
years an oil company will come around & do some test drilling, 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel logs 
page 36 
also Rte. 55 may go through there. 
These possibilities make some 
people buy 
it for speculation. 
This land shouldn't be developed 
because we need the water resource G-Great Cedar Swamp; 34GT, 35GT, 
36GT, but it's also wrong to charge $6 or $8 or $9 a year an acre 
tax on it, 
if 
it's only good once every 80 or 100 years. 
Land 
values have increased immensely in area. 
Their lot was bought in 
1949 or 1950, for $100 for 10 acres. 
Now the lots across the 
street are worth $17-18,000 for 1 1/2 acres! 
12.5 min. 
Can't account for this increase in value 
in unimproved land 
with no municipal services. 
Local taxes pay only for school. 
George Brewer, Jr. 
is president of 
local school board. 
There is 
a small, 
local fire co. tax, and 
in some areas, a lighting tax. 
G-Dennisville; 34GT 
Lots across the street were transferred, 
in a 
10-acre chunk, for a debt of $6,000 during the 1960s. 
Can build 
on that land because it was already established lots, when 
Pinelands came in. 
They just had sawmill G-Great Cedar Swamp; 
34GT, 35GT, 36GT land subdivided. 
Local ordinance limits building 
to 3.2-acre lots. 
New Pinelands ordinance will 
limit it to 
5 
acres. 
Used to have a 2-acre minimum. 
Land is marginal & has no 
sewers, so building needs to be spaced. 
Fire co., sawmill, development. 
15 
min. 
When ordinance passed, many argued for 1-acre minimums, but 
with individual septic systems, doesn't work well. 
Thinks 5 
acres 
is too much. 
They were even talking 16 acres or 20-
something acres. 
In the Pinelands Core Area it's like that. 
He 
likes the woods and wants area to remain rural, but if North 
Jersey wants to protect the 
water resource G-Great Cedar Swamp; 
34GT, 35GT, 36GT, they should let the state buy the land, not steal 
it, which is, 
in effect what they've done. You may own 
it, 
but 
the restrictions are such that you can't do anything on 
it. 
When 
Pinelands "went through" there was a big noise about South Jersey 
seceding to become a separate state, which got a lot of press and 
people were dead serious. 
North Jersey has political clout & 
votes to control the legislature, as it did with Pinelands. 
Many 
people in Cape May Co. are apathetic about happenings in Trenton, 
but they are gradually waking up. 
"Many times, 
if they'd do a 
little shouting, they wouldn't get the short end of the stick as 
they do." 
Water resource, government.

People were dead serious about secession, and 
it did some 
good by making people sit up and take notice. 
Delaware has 
similar thing, with lower counties not wanting to have anything 
to do with New Castle Co. 
Would rather it joined back up with 
Pennsylvania. 
George is a ham radio operator & when he says he's 
from N.J., people think of a concrete jungle. 
Parts of Ocean & 
Atlantic Counties in Wharton Tract have absolutely nothing.

South Jersey is

Everything south of Trenton is mostly sand. 
It's

Down on

"Piney" defined. 
Pineys were people who went out in the 
woods & lived 
in almost a primitive nature. "Now I knew 1 guy, 
for instance, who grew up 
in a cabin & 1 morning he woke up & his 
hair was froze to the floor." 
This was 
in the 1930s. 
Used to 
have some Pineys working for him. 
Mostly lived in Atlantic & 
Ocean Co.'s. 
Many made charcoal or lived off the land. 
"They 
lived about as close to what like probably an Indian did as 
anything you could come to." George, Sr., who grew up 
in 
Blackwood, used to see them come down the Black Horse Pike into 
the Weymouth area to hunt. He said you'd come down this gravel 
road and you'd see kids, but when you got there, there was no one 
there." Pineys had their families and fairly good morals.

TX01: G—Dennisville; 34GT Makes cedar used for decking & planking 
of oysterboats. Bivalve Packing Co. has boatbuilding & repair 
equipment right on the dock at Bivalve. 
That's where George 
delivered some planking just recently. Bivalve Packing Co. just 
cut one boat in 1/2 & lengthened it & also built a small boat. 
Leland Champion & Sons supplied the oak keel. Doesn't know if 
they have a shipyard. 
Wheaton Industries owns the Dorchester 
Shipyard; used to build wooden minesweepers there. George, Sr. 
ran the sawmill they had at Dorchester Shipyard during WWII. 
That mill had extra long carriage on 
it. 
Used to be Stoneman's 
Shipyard before it was called Dorchester Shipyard. 
Frank Wheaton

TV station personnel once followed George into cedar swamp

Mill 
is very elementary; very crude compared to most mills 
today, but it serves their purposes because so many different 
sizes & types of lumber. 
Modern mill uses head saw just to block 
a log out with & square it up, then it goes through a series of 
other saws and resaws. 
Champions makes mostly pallets, so they 
just square it up & run 
it through a gangsaw to make boards. That 
doesn't work for 
Brewer as they cut so many different types of

technology. 
Almost everything is used for something. 
Big mills chip 
their slabs for pulp. 
Brewer sells his slabs to a man who makes 
souvenirs; sawdust goes for bedding for horses. 
Once every 2 or 
3 weeks bring a cord of trash down to the swamp to use for a 
road. 
This mill has been in operation since 1953; George, Sr. 
started one 
in Dennisville in 1944. Bought mill 2nd—hand from 
Bluebird, Delaware in 1959 or '60. 
A relatively old mill, but it 
does what they want it to do. 
5 min. 
Describes piece of machinery: 
Is actually a molder—matcher 
or "sticker." Was made in Smithville by a guy named Smith, who 
ran for office on the Bull Moose ticket & campaigned by having a 
cart pulled by a tame moose. Molder—matcher probably built around 
WWI. 
A new one would be 
identical, except for having an electric 
motor on each shaft head (instead of them being belt driven by a 
diesel). His has been modified somewhat, with babbitt bearings 
replaced by roller bearings. Although it's a molder—matcher they 
use 
it as a 4—sided planer. Comes with a pickup—load of knives. 
Came from Kimball & Prince Lumber in Vineland, who used it to 
make custom moldings. Also has a regular planer which he uses as 
a single surface planer. 
Describes lumber laying 
in piles: 
clapboard siding, 2x4"s, decking. 
Cuts mostly to order, but also 
some stuff they anticipate having a call for. 
Cut pieces for 
picnic tables and all the cedar siding they can cut. 
Cuts lots 
of 1x4"s. Bin will fill up with lx4"s, then they'll get a run on 
them & they won't get any. G—Dennisville; 34GT

Shows pieces that he has specially cut for carving wood to 
be used by "duck carvers" (decoy carvers). 
Has become a very 
common hobby in area. 
Many night schools & vocational schools 
are running classes in woodcarving. 
Try to cut knotless slabs 
off sides of 
logs for carvers. 
People come from all 
the way 
in 
New York State to get it. 
Best carving is balsam or basswood, 
but it's too expensive for most carvers. 
Points out feather edge

of junk. arts and crafts. 
Logs are put on carriage, run through saw, and out up. 
All 
mills basically operate the same. 
Brewer's mill 
is a left—hand 
mill, thus different from about 98% of the mills in the country. 
Left—hand mills made to be run from a farm tractor drive. 
Most 
industrial engines run right—hand. 
10 min. 
The old mill that was in there before (which was made in 
late 1800s) was also a left—hand, so they were surprised, when 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel logs 
page 40 
they went to 
look at the mill they have now and found out that it 
too was a left—hand. Left—hand mills when new had to be ordered 
special. When he recently ordered a new shaft for the mill, 
it 
was a problem because the threads had to be 
in reverse. Probably 
isn't 1 out of 100 that's a left—hand. 
The 
lot where they are located was once a farm called the 
Menagia (spelling?) lot. George built the house in which his 
mother now lives when he was a senior in high school. In 1952-53 
there wasn't much business, so they cut the lumber for it 
in 
summer of 1952 out back on the 
lot and built the house during the 
winter. 
George, Sr. wasn't too handy with tools.

Will be able to go out cutting most any day next week. Will 
probably be going out on Tuesday and will get in 
in time to do 
some sawing, too. Suggests bringing sandwiches, as 
if they leave 
at 8 a.m., they probably won't get back until 2:30 or 3 p.m. 
(Robert Brewer suggests bringing boots, too. Worries about us 
being able to hold on to the sled.) 
George will bring some 
plywood for us to sit or stand on. 
Shows sleds that they bring 
logs out on. After we get about as far as we can go by truck, 
we've got about 1/2 hr. 
ride by tractor & sled to place where 
they're cutting. 
Points out trash they use to help build up the 
road. A shame that the cutting 
is 
so far back right now, but if 
you've never been there before, 
it could be 
interesting.

is. 
Lived in woods all 
of his 
life. 
Hardly ever went to school. 
"But he's 
got more ambition 
than any person I"ve ever known." When he worked for George, 
Charlie used to get up at about 5 a.m. to "pick the dumps" as a 
scavenger, sorting junk, then come into work at 8, work all 
day, 
go home, putter another hr. or so, and he's close to 70, now.

We 
used to have a fellow used to work for us.... He'd do that,

get a big crash, and you'd have one heck of a mess, but...." 
George explains how you make 2 notches & a hinge to make 
tree fall where you want it to. 
"You make you're 2nd cut a little 
above the first cut & by varyin' that hinge, you can guide the 
tree. 
If you hold this corner, it's gonna go this way.

Not much use of cedar for masts, as they're

G—Heislerville; 38GT Lou Peterson shows off different types 
of nets. 
Nowadays most fishermen buy their own "lease," [i.e., 
netting or webbing] by the pound, and then assemble into the type 
of net needed. 
Outside edge of lease called "salvage" by 
Peterson [actually, selvage]. 
Can be bought "stretched measure," 
or "knot to knot." Peterson always buys "stretched measure." 
Sample he shows 
is 208—wt. 3—in. stretched [gill netting] for 
summer fishing of weakfish & bunker. 
Would be counted as 1 1/2 
in. 
knot to knot. For bunker fishing lease 
is "hung half," 
meaning 6 in. 
stretched of lease 
is hung on ties 3 in. apart 
thereby causing it to slack and be effective for gilling. 
In 
cold weather that's not slack enough, but "hung half" 
is fine in 
summer when fish are more active. In spring, when water's cold, 
nets have to be "hung a third," or fish will just lie against net 
until tide changes, at which time they drift away. 
The warmer 
the water, the tighter you can hang your net and still catch. 
In 
river, when it's cold, "hung a third" isn't even effective and 
you have to "hang two—thirds" to have enough slack for drifting 
gill nets. 
In cold weather, lighter mesh lease necessary. 
208— 
wt. 
ineffective, so they use 77—wt. or 139—wt. 
Peterson prefers 
139—wt. 
in spring. 
2.5 min. 
(animal), fishing, technology. 
Lease for gill nets 
is 
[nylon] monofilament. 
Fishermen used 
to do their own knitting of cotton nets. Used a spool of twine 
around a few fingers as a gauge for keeping mesh even. Fishermen 
used to sit all winter knitting, with lease attached by one end 
to spokes of back of a kitchen chair. Much hand knitting still 
pursued around Nova Scotia. 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel logs 
page 56 
The next thing you decide 
is how much you want net to sink 
or float, which is done by balancing corks and leads. 
Used to 
buy round corks, but use of reels has made them impractical. 
Shows large cork used for shad net. Such corks have to be 
large 
enough not to fall through lease, tangle, and tear the lease. 
With 3—in. mesh you need 3 1/2—in. cork, so 
it won't fall 
through. 
Corks used to be made of cork, are now light plastic. 
Older types would crush when net reeled in, 
so they have had to 
go over to a longer, more solid type called a crushproof cork. 
Hollow plastic also used, but they are very stiff and tend to 
tear lease, because they do not bend. Lease is attached to ropes 
[or "tie lines"] by "hanging—in ties." Lou buys "hanging—in ties" 
in one gauge bigger than the lease so that they don't break as 
easily. 
Buys tarred no. 3 ties. 
Tarred ones are stiffer and 
hold knot in place. 
Some use spun nylon instead. Hanging of nets 
varies according to 
individual fishermen's preference. 
5 min. 
"Hanging—in ties" mounted are on knitting needle and tie the 
lease to the rope at determined intervals. 
In order to make your 
net sink, you have to have more weight of lead than buoyancy of 
"cork." Cork he shows has 5 1/4—oz. buoyancy, so 
in order to 
sink, has to be balanced by more than 5 1/4 oz. of 
lead per cork. 
To keep net tight, can put 2 per fathom or one, according to type 
of fishing being done. 
If you want net to float, you must have 
less than 5 1/4 oz. 
of 
lead per 5 1/4—oz. cork. 
When attaching 
corks, 
leads, and lease, you make yourself a "tie line," which 
is 
a rope with regularly spaced marks indicating positions for 
attachment, set up according to preference, species sought, 
fishing method., etc. Tie lines sometimes tend to kink when under 
stress, so fishermen are going over to braided tie lines since 
they've been using reels. With older tie lines, 
leads, which 
slipped over the line, often worked loose, slipped around, and 
damaged the lease. 
Now with braided tie line, they have bullet 
leads, which are slipped inside the braided tie line. 
7.5 min. 
Lead—cored rope not practical 
in area, because you have to 
go to such a big line (due to tides) that it gets prohibitively 
expensive. Use of bullet leads tends to shorten the tie line by 
forcing braiding to bunch up around each lead. 
Such nets are very 
easy to modify. 
You can quickly make a sinking net into a 
floating net by merely removing every other bullet lead. Bullet 
leads made locally. 
A man in Port Norris has a bullet lead mold 
and fishermen just bring their old leads to him & he recasts 
them. Bullet leads have come in 
in past 4 or 5 years. 
Reels have 
just come into use 
in past 6 years. Peterson buys lease from 
Nylon Net Co. 
in Memphis. 
Buying lease ready—made saves 
tremendous amount of work. 
In old days using linen nets, nets 
had to be taken 
in after every use, dragged through "lime boxes" 
[watertight boxes containing a Ca(OH)2 solution], and then put up 
on net drying poles to dry. 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 57 
10 min. 
All 
along coast there were cedar poles with nails in them 
used for drying linen nets. This slowed down the rotting of the 
linen. 
When nylon twine came along this was no 
longer necessary. 
Now monofilament has replaced it. 
"It's really great as far as 
maintenance is concerned. 
This stuff you can just throw it down 
in a pile and forget about it." It's the best ever, but it 
is 
susceptible to damage by sunlight [probably ultraviolet radiation 
damage]. Large steel rings are used as 
leads for shad fishing. 
Shad fishing done with 5 1/2" and 6" 
lease, which would badly 
tangle ordinary lead 
leads, because tie lines or ropes have to be 
light too -- 5/16" or even 1/4" rope used as tie 
lines for shad 
fishing. 
Too easy for ordinary lead leads to fall through lease 
and tangle up, so they've gone over to rings which are tied to 
rope instead. 
If they misgauge while using rings and nets not 
weighted enough, bricks with holes in them can be tied at 
intervals to 
increase weight. 
Some shad fishermen don't use any 
permanently mounted leads on shad nets. 
Instead, they "brick it" 
[tie bricks on temporarily] before each use, according to 
strength of the tide at that particular time. Bricks particularly 
useful as they are suspended from a rope, thereby holding net off 
the bottom so that king crabs can crawl underneath instead of 
getting entangled in the net. Otherwise crabs just crawl up the 
net, get tangled, and sink the net by adding their weight to 
it. 
Shad usually run starting March and going through May, though 
occasionally they last 'til 
June. 
12.5 min. 
You can't shad fish with staked out gill nets after water 
reaches about 50o F., because the fish will 
"go soft" or spoil 
after about 1 to 1 1/2 hr. 
in the net. As soon as water reaches 
50o F., they go to "drifting" their gill nets. 
Can be done 
in 
several ways. 
The old way, which is not used as often as 
it used 
to be (although Louis still prefers it) 
is to "circle set." 
You 
tie one end of net to boat, 
let net out [i.e., shoot the net], 
and drive boat in a diminishing circle, hauling net and fish in. 
Most "drifting" of gill nets now done 
in "straight set." 
Net set 
in a straight line across the tide, with a buoy on each end. 
Usually set in sets of three. 
After the third one 
is set, they 
go back and pick up the first, and so on. Only types of net 
legally permitted in Delaware Bay area are gill nets and haul 
seines, although some fishermen can get special permits to set 
"fish pounds" [pound nets], so fishing in area is generally 
drifting gill nets, staking gill 
nets, or hauling seines, each of 
which activity requires its own particular license. 
15 min. 
Haul seining done thus: 
Find a place on a beach around 
mouth of a ditch. 
Net put on a bateau or some kind of a rowboat, 
and you let out net making a half circle, with both ends of the 
net on the beach. 
Whatever fish are trapped 
in the half circle 
are dragged up on the beach as two men haul the net up on the 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel logs 
page 58 
beach. 
Can be done by only one man 
if one end of net is staked 
or anchored. Works better with 2 men. 
Much of this hauling done 
farther up the Maurice River from the bay, for catching herring 
(fished for their roe), perch, and catfish in winter. 
Only one 
species of catfish lives 
in area. 
Not the large species found in 
inland rivers. 
Get up to 5 or 6 lbs. 
Usually run about 1 to 1-
1/2 lb. fishing, technology, G—Heislerville; 38GT 
All fish tend to be coarser and less desirable when they are 
large than when they are smaller. Louis' favorite fish is perch, 
which he 
likes because it 
is a strong flavored fish. 
Most of 
fish eaten 
in area is weakfish, which is good below 1-1/2 lbs., 
but not as good when they run larger. 
Doesn't prefer flounder 
because they are relatively flavorless unless permitted to spoil 
a bit. 
Likes eel, provided they are smoked. 
Smoked weakfish is 
the best smoked fish available. 
First tried out smoked weakfish 
about 6-7 years ago when he was working in the shipyard. (foodways) 
17.5 min. 
People don't smoke fish commercially in area. 
Some old 
timers used to smoke fish in an old refrigerator mounted on 
cinder blocks, with a fire below, usually made of hickory, 
occasionally sassafras, though the latter gave an "odd" flavor. 
Hickory scarce in area, so usually mixed with other wood 
available. 
Louis Peterson doesn't eel. 
"That's a whole different 
ballgame. 
You can't just set an eel pot and catch eels." His 
brother in 
law eels. 
Has 2 or 3 different kinds of pots for 
different occasions, depending on whether you're eeling for salt 
eels, eeling 
in spring or summer. 
You have to follow the eels, 
sometimes Louis brother in 
law [who lives in & fishes out of 
Heislerville] will 
go as far as the Delaware Memorial Bridge in 
pursuit of eels. 
You have to have a fast boat to be able to 
cover enough territory. 
Eels salted, put in a brine. 
Puts them 
in salt to take off the slime and to make them vomit up stomach 
contents, so they keep better. 
Then they are put in 
layers of 
alternating eel 
and salt and eel 
and salt, bagged up and weighed, 
and sold to crabbers. 
Have to have a cooler to store eels, and a 
freezer to freeze bait. King crabs used as bait & have to be 
frozen in order to keep. 
20 min. 
"So, most o' 
your eelers and there's been a lot of people 
that's tried it and they go broke the first year or so. 
Most o' 
your eelers are people that has been in 
it and got their cooler. 
They got their freezer and have a standing market. They have a 
market that's been established over the years, and there is a 
limited market for eels right around here, I mean, most o' 
Russell's eels are sold down the Chesapeake, down there for 
crabbers, crab bait." Little live eel business in area, but 
brother in 
law does sell a few. Storing live eels depends on a 
supply of cool water or, 
if water is too warm, eels will bruise

eeling. 
Eel pot costs about X15-18 to make. 
Have to buy your 
wire, set up a brake to bend wire. 
Have to make your funnels. 
Uses a big paper cutter to cut wire mesh. 
Has to have a sand 
blaster to clean pots with. 
"It's a situation all 
its own. 
If 
you're eelin', you're not doin' anythin' but eelin'." 
Eelers 
listed as fishermen for tax purposes, but they are considered to 
be "eelers." Brother in 
law works from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. during 
the season. 
22.5 min. 
"By the time he goes and tends his eel 
pots and baits 'em 
and resets 'em, and salts his eels, washes 'em and salts 'em, and 
weighs 'em up and gets his bait, 
if he's gotta get bait, and 
it 
just eats up all that time. 
'Course, now in November, he's 
windin' down now, he's takin' his pots up and stuff. 
From now 
'til March is when he'll build his pots and stuff, he'll have it 
a little easier, but then 
in the wintertime, he has to build his 
pots, and take care of his boats, and I don't know what his fuel 
bill 
is, 
but it's pretty much." He uses two 100—h.p. outboards, 
so he can get the 50 miles by water to the Delaware Memorial 
Bridge. Around 1 November he'll quit as water gets too cold & 
eels burrow in mud or migrate. 
Mostly what Louis Peterson does is clam & tong & fish & 
dredge, & also crab once 
in awhile. 
Doesn't have any crab pots 
right now. 
Crabbing hasn't been that good lately. 
Has 3 kinds 
of heads for oyster tongs: 
wooden heads, barrel heads, and 
keyport heads. 
Keyport heads' stales for handles) go clear down 
to the tooth bar on the inside. 
On the barrel heads, you have 
metal 
loop, so handles don't go clear down to tooth bar. 
On 
wooden heads, heads made of seasoned oak, mounted with teeth of 
sawed—off steel pounded through. 
Mesh or "brails," as they call 
it, 
is 
inserted in the wood. 
25 min. 
Different types of tong heads are used according to tongers 
preference. 
Wooden heads best for real soft bottom. "You can 
catch oysters with those when you can't catch anything but mud 
with these other ones." 
Barrel heads used much 
in the South. 
Louis doesn't care much for them. 
Has his set up for shallow 
bottom hard bottom tonging. 
Barrel heads don't necessarily hold 
more stuff. 
Tong heads bought by the number of teeth: 14, 
16, or 
18, occasionally 12. 
If you're working lightweight shelled 
oysters, you can use a bigger head, but with heavy shelled 
oysters or 
in heavy tide, bigger heads tend to get too heavy. 
Keyport heads are his favorite type.

Louis Peterson's grandfather was first one 
in 
immediate 
family to take up working on the bay. Grandfather and his brother 
were sent to work carrying glass in glass house at age 10, but he 
disappeared in spring. At the end of bay season, he came home 
after 2 months. 
Had walked to Greenwich from Bridgeton and had 
shipped on an oyster boat as a cabin boy. 
Made more money on the 
bay as a cabin boy than he would have carrying glass, so they 
left him alone. 
5 min. 
When grandfather was 14, went down to Greenwich, dug out a 
small sailboat up from the mud, rigged it, 
and went to catch 
oysters. 
Was a captain of the "mosquito fleet" of small oyster 
boats, under 20 or 25 feet, mostly around 16 feet. 
Usually had 
one dredge on them. 
"Mosquito fleet" died out during Louis' 
father's time. "Mosquito fleet" could both dredge or tong. 
Many 
came out of Dividing Creek and tonged the high beds between Egg 
Island & mouth of Maurice River. 
Would sail out, unstep mast, 
and go to work. Some of oystermen actually lived on the boats, 
in 
the decked—over portion of the bow. 
Beds were so tight, that 
they had to crawl out to turn over. Grandfather & grandmother 
lived on their "mosquito fleet" boat. Would work bay 
in daytime, 
then go 
into creeks and anchor at night. Grandfather then 
graduated to a bigger boat, the "Jenny Chance," a 42—footer. 
family history. 
7.5 min. 
Grandfather did "anything that he could do" to make a 
living, 
including freighting oysters to & from Delaware, 
freighting tomatos, watermelons, and hay all 
the way to 
Philadelphia in a sailboat. "If it could be done with a boat, he 
did 
it. 
If 
it couldn't be done with a boat, 
it wasn't worth 
botherin' with." Died at age of 76 of appendicitis. When he got 
the "Jenny Chance," she was 
in good condition. 
They always 
called her "the Old Chance." 
This was his first powerboat. "He 
thought he could go around the world in that boat. I've heard Pop 
say that he didn't think anything of going anywheres with her. He 
had an engine. He could just go anywhere." 
Was better at docking 
under sail than under power. Was more used to sail than power. 
Years later, the "Jenny Chance" burned up on the "'Tuxent Creek" 
(Nantuxent Creek), due to an overturned cook stove. After that he 
used his brother Aaron's boat, which had a Ford V-8 engine and 
went very fast. "Well, wide open was good enough for Grandpop." 
"And Uncle Aaron, he'd be talkin' with Dad and a couple 
other hands up on the bow, be tellin' jokes and laughin', you 
know, and I'd be back in the wheel house w' 
Grandpop and he'd be

tellin' me tales. 
Actually, he was teachin' me. 
He, 
Grandfather, couldn't read nor write. He couldn't even write his 
own name or he couldn't read 
it 
if he seen it, but he could count 
and he knew what he was doin' and he had poems that was his way 
of rememberin' your nautical terms for your navigation and stuff 
o' 
that way. 
And he would sit there and recite these poems to 
me, goin' 
in and out and talk to me, and I can't begin to 
remember and I wish I had. 
I wish I'd paid more attention to him 
'cause there was things that I missed later. No, I'm sorry to say 
I can't remember 'em, but it would be just combinations of 
lights, such as, 
'If a red and green and white you see, then on 
your left he'll be,' 
or somethin' 
like that or that way, you 
know. 
And he would sit there and he would tell me these things 
and then he would say, 
'If only a green...,' or whatever, why, he 
had terms for if your boat was dead ahead or goin' away from you 
or whatever it would be." folk speech, rhymes. 
10 min. 
Didn't know anyone else who did these things. Had a close 
relationship with his grandfather, his dad & his uncles. 
Worked 
with them on the bay and "we were a very tight family, very 
clannish." 
TX02: 
Can show the house his dad & brothers & all 
the others 
lived 
in right around Heislerville. 
Until WWII, the only work 
in 
area was farming and working the bay. 
After WWII, people, 
including women, went to work at shipyard, which "destroyed a way 
of 
life." 
The farms were allowed to run down. 
The farm that he 
has now was a good "one horse farm," when he was a youngster. 
Would hire a team to come 
in & plow. 
The farm raised 
strawberries. "This was the strawberry capital of the world, 
right here." Strawberries shipped out by the trainload. 
All 
strawberry farms gone, now. 
Most are now in Cedarville & 
Newport. 
Used to get 3 1/2c./qt. to pick strawberries when he 
was a kid. 
"You had to pick 'em just so, or you wasn't allowed 
in the patch." 
Used to make money dropping corn for farmers. 
Lots of mules were used 
in area. 
In salt hay industry, they used 
horses, because feet were bigger and didn't cut up the marshes as 
mules would. Still much salt haying going on, Ezra Cox & Stewart 
Campbell on Stinson Island, and Clarence Barry over at Point 
Norris. 
Salt haying a year round activity. 
Clarence Barry has

Salt hay 
is waterproof. 
Used on highways & banks to prevent 
erosion, because it sheds water. When they used to stack "fresh 
hay" (i.e., ordinary hay) 
in area, they would cover it with a 
layer of salt hay to keep it dry. 
"And then they'd 'brick it.' 
They would mound it up , they would make their stack flat, and 
then they would put a crown on 
it with salt hay and then they 
would tie binder twine on 
it on a brick and throw it over the top

Most of the 
oystermen in the old days were also farmers, who, 
in the off 
season in the winter, went oystering, but many of them , like his 
grandfather, never did anything but oystering. He ran oysters in 
winter months, planted them in the spring, and tonged planting 
oysters 
in the summertime, and 
in the fall he would run them for 
market, starting in September.

Louis Peterson was born on Christmas Day. His father was 
up 
in Greenwich unloading oysters on Christmas Eve, & when he 
came home, Lou's mother was ready to go to the hospital, and 
it 
had been snowing all 
day, and they had to drive through 3 or 4" 
of snow to get to Bridgeton Hospital. 
15 min. 
Back then they got $2 per day working sunup to 
sundown, after which they had to unload the boat. Worked for 
Norman Jeffries that year. 
Jeffries had a boatyard in Greenwich, 
was big oysterman, & is still 
living 
When Louis was young they 
took sails off the oyster boats, his dad had been a sailboat 
captain. Father had seen Grandpop in the "Jenny Chance" coming 
across from Delaware in a nor'wester in December, with his face 
covered with ice. 
On sailboats, you had to stand outside to 
steer, so spray would freeze on you. 
Used to catch oysters in 
winter and put them below with a lantern to keep them from 
freezing. 
Today holds are so full 
of machinery, there's no room 
for oysters in them, so you can't oyster if 
it freezes hard or 
the oysters wi11 freeze, as they are stored on deck. 
Used to be 
oysters in Delaware Bay all 
the way from Cape May to Arnold's 
[Point]. 
Now found only 
in a small area off Egg Island. 
Louis 
believes that they were wiped out by overfishing. 
Official 
explanation is that they were killed off by the disease MSX. 
Believes that they destroyed too much of the bottom. 
labor, 
conservation, fishing. 
17.5 min. 
He believes that the business could be saved if the state 
would not let 
it be controlled by the oystermen, but put in 
effect a "good, comprehensive conservation plan." 
As long as 
oystermen are allowed to govern it themselves, "they're gonna 
look out for a dollar and not for the good of the oyster." 
Believes that they should emulate the programs of New York, 
Maryland, and California. "There's got to be something better 
than just going out and catching a seed oyster on a state 
sanctuary, and dumping him overboard, and hoping he'll 
live.... 
Where would a farmer be 
if he just went out there and chucked 
some seed on the ground and hoped it survived?" 
Problem is no 
one 
in area spending money to find out way to improve. 
Now 
there's no real money in 
it. 
Back 
in 
1950s, wages were good for 
an oysterboat captain who worked for a company. Christmas Eve, 
your boss would come around and ask to borrow your car, & when he 
came back, he gave you the keys to a brand new car. 
"That was 
your Christmas present from your oyster company." 
When oysters 
died, that stopped. 
Back then, captains were employed year

round, during off season you overhauled the boat. 
It was your 
responsibility to take care of the boat just as 
if 
it was your 
own -- keeping it painted and tight, shipshape. "And 
if you made 
your company money, why, they treated you right. 
'Course you 
didn't get to be a captain for those companies if you didn't 
keep things right." 
Lou Peterson learned bayman-skills from his dad. first 
started going out with his father at about age 8, every day 
in 
the summer. His first job was to steer an inboard-motored garvey 
up and down a trotline or "trawl-line," catching crabs. 
Had a 
Ford Model-A motor in 
it and no marine clutch, just a truck-
clutch. 
to slow engine down, "you just whipped it 
in gear." 
This he hated to do, because of the way 
it made his hand tickle. 
Usually ran it 
in 2nd gear, with a 14 by 14 propeller. 
Would go 
ashore and cut some salt-grass, which would be put in hamper 
interspersed with layers of grass and layers of crabs. 
Last time 
they did that, they caught 20 to 25 bushels of crabs before noon 
and had to get them to the Philadelphia-bound truck at Matt's 
Landing before noon, or they'd miss the truck. 
For this they got 
35 cents a bushel. 
22.5 min. 
The baskets cost that much, so they had to quit, because you 
couldn't sell blue-claw crabs at a profitable price. 
There were 
too many. 
Then he started tonging oysters for Newcomb Brothers. 
they had a 24-foot outboard-mounted garvey. (they had made a 
houseboat out of the one with the Model-A engine, whose name was 
"Tommy," and lived on 
it all winter on 'Tuxent Creek G-Nantuxent 
Creek], while they worked tonging market-oysters for D'Agostino. 
This was the first winter that Dennis Creek was found to have a 
lot of oysters, "and they went crazy down there." 
Tractor-
trailer loads shipped out of there then. 
His father and 
grandfather lived on the "Tommy" together, then. 
Had a bateau, 
too, but it was stolen that winter. 
so he got a garvey built by 
a local cross-eyed boatbuilder called "Cock-eyed jack." 
Was a 
90-year-old 24-footer, 4 1/2 feet wide. 
25 min. 
Boat was made of 2" thick cypress. 
He put a new stern in 
it. 
rowed it for about a month and then bought a 4 1/2 horse-
power Martin outboard. 
They were well-pleased with the motor, 
because it took only 45 minutes to get from Matt's Landing to the 
mouth of Maurice River. 
Today it takes less than 10 minutes. 
Engine could "just about make it against the tide, but that was 
good enough if you was going." 
Did some crabbing with that boat, 
too, but he didn't crab if he could catch oysters. 
Didn't do 
much real fishing. 
when Lou got to be about 12, 
he started doing 
some fishing, as his father had, but not his grandfather. 
Louis 
learned his fishing trade from the other boys and from a man 
named Henry Anderson, whose father was fisherman.

Good personal 
experience narratives on this tape, with use of oysterman's 
jargon. 
Louis Peterson has four daughters. 
When he was 3, 
he was 
sent to run garvey from Uncle Aaron's boat to Newcomb Bros.' buy 
boat. His grandfather planted the first ground of oysters that 
Newcomb Bros. ever had, and they made money, so anytime Uncle 
Aaron wanted to plant a ground of oysters, he'd have plenty of 
money to do it with. 
Newcomb Bros. would buy. 
At end of the 
day, they would take oysters off of 
little boat and on to big 
boat, & then take big boat off Egg Island & plant them, & little 
boats would be anchored. 
So his father sent him up to tie up the 
little boat by himself. "Instead of anchorin' the boat that day, 
& takin' me with him, he sent me up with the boat. 
Well, I had 
her up and I had her tied up and had the outboard off and 
everything straightened away and all scrubbed down when he got 
back in." 
A few weeks later, he was asked to tow Uncle Aaron's 
boat up with 
it too. After a while he'd have a raft of boats all 
lashed together, with 2 or 3 outboards powering them. Doing this 
gave him the feel 
of boats against the tide. 
You learn location 
of eddies to help get up the river and make the best time. 
Used 
to 
load those little boats down to their "rubbin' rails," with 
only about 2" of freeboard. 
A loaded boat was about 50 bushels & 
oysters weigh about 80 lb./ bushel, so you had about 2 tons 
in 
one 20 ft. x 4-1/2 ft. wide boat. 
If a boat was loaded, 
it was 
more "tippy, up the Maurice 
Aaron just grabbed the rope instead of the wheel, so he 
understood that he was going to be allowed to dock the boat. 
So 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 68 
that was his first experience docking the big boat. 
Was scared 
to death, but he did it. 
Biggest mistake people make nowadays is 
that they're afraid to go ahead. "They want to stop before they 
get there. You keep her under power until you get there so you 
can control her." Have to check your drift if you're docking a 
sizeable boat. 
If you have a big boat with a lot of weight & you 
come up too hard, "you're gonna tear somethin' up." 
Just before 
he gets in, he takes her out of gear to check the drift & see how 
far she'll go before she stops. 
Then he puts her back 
in gear, 
takes her in, 
and knows when to take her out of gear so she's 
almost stopped when the lines go out on her. 
Becoming a captain 
is by being at it all your life, and graduating on up to bigger 
boats, and developing a reputation for honesty. Eventually you'll 
be approached by someone who doesn't have a captain that day, who 
wants you to go up & catch oysters. He was working in shipyard 
when he first hired out. occupations. 
5 min. 
He had put a "through haul" 
in for a "shell discharge," when 
they first started putting in "machines" 
in boats. 
Louis built 
the second "machine" that was used in 
local oyster industry. 
("Machine" = sorting machine) 
Another man designed it & asked 
Louis to put it together for him. 
Early sorters were rather 
primitive, now they are very effective. 
Early ones were single 
drums with pieces of pipe welded in them 1" apart, staggered. 
A 
man was having a pipe mounted so that shells that came out of the 
drum would go out under the boat, so he stayed over the weekend 
to mount the drum. 
While working on the boat, 
it's owner asked 
him to run the boat for him. The other captain hadn't wanted to 
work 
it. 
They had a hurricane that fall, and they were working a 
piece of bottom called the "Lab Ground," which belongs to Rutgers 
University's Oyster Lab. 
Wind was northeast, so 
it wasn't rough, 
but there was quite a bit of wind and lots of rain, but he stayed 
all 
day & took 
in over 600 bushels. His boss, Herb Luther, was 
very impressed and said, "I'll tell 
you one thing. He never let 
the weather bother him." So he "got a reputation to get the job 
done."

Some people along the river don't want to hire an honest 
man. Would rather have one who 
is 
"a little bit shady." "And then 
from then on, after people on the river learn that you can run a 
boat, that you know how to catch oysters, why, you have pretty 
steady employment." 
You also have to know when a boat is sinking 
& when it's loaded. Has almost lost 2 boats in his life. 
"In a 
blow, one time, up 
in the spring o' 
the year, wind was nor'west & 
she drawed 8 feet o' 
water & I had never worked that far up the 
river. 
I had never worked above Benny's Point. Dad never worked 
above Benny's, so I never been up there & there was a bar called 
Benny's Bar up there, Benny's Shoal, actually it 
is, 
and there 
were boats that were much bigger than I am or was, workin' there, 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel logs 
page 69 
so I figured, well I won't get on that bar if I follow the bigger 
boats, so I got behind the biggest boat in the fleet, then I was 
following him up & down the haul, up & down the bay, blowin', 
it 
was rougher'n all 
getout and I went to haul one dredge up & it 
was all bent up, all mangled & my boss was workin' another boat, 
he owned 2 boats. I told him, I says, 
'Luther, I don't know 
whether I've got,' I got on the radio, I said, 
'I don't know what 
I've just got into here, but I just tore one of them dredges all 
up.' 
'Well,' 
he says, 
'put your spare on.' So I put me spare on. 
We made another round or so and pulled it up, and that one was 
all 
bent up. 
Well, my 
lands, here I've destroyed 2 dredges, 
here, and I wasn't nowheres near there where I thought the hang 
was, you know? 
So I pulled the other dredge up to go 
in the 
Cohansey River & straighten the dredges out and that one was all 
bent up too. 
That one, the back one was all caved in on. 
Well, 
now wait a minute, I got on them dredges, you know. 
So I got on, 
I said, 
'Luther,' I says, 
'I 
got on, I've run on top o' 
these 
dredges and bent 'em all 
up,' I says, 
'I've got all three of 
'em 
bent up here.' 
'Well,' he says, 'you better take 'em in, 
load 
'em on your truck and get 'em 
down to the blacksmith shop near 
Cedarville & get 'em fixed.' 
So I started to go 
in, 
you know the 
crew they was happy, you know, they was goin' 
to get paid all day 
for workin' 2 or 3 hours. It was blowin', wasn't fit to work 
anyway. 
So they went down the cabin & they come back up & they 
was all 
'Darkies,' you know, their eyes was great big and they 
says, 
'Cap'? You better come down look at dis.' Well, pay much 
attention to 
'em, you know. Says, 
'Cap'? You better come down 
look at dis.' I says, 'What's the matter?' Says, 
'She got a lot 
o' 
water in 
'er.' And I went down and looked down 
in that engine 
room and water was up to me knees on the engine room floor. Oh, 
my gosh! I looked and pumps was all 
runnin'. Well, 
it wasn't all 
of 
'em runnin', one of 
'em was stopped. 
So I got down 
in there 
and got the other one a—goin'. 
Well 
it wasn't gainin' on me too 
fast and I got on the radio and I called Luther, I says, 'Luther, 
I'm sinkin',' and he says, 'You're what?' I says, 
'I'm sinkin'. I 
got water up over the clutch o' 
this boat now,' I says, 
'about 4 
or 6 inches below the breather on the motor. It gets in that 
breather, 
it's gone, 
'cause it's a diesel.' Then I says, 'I'm up 
to my knees in water right now, down here.' 
He says, 
'Well, 
don't beach her,' he says. 
'If she's gonna sink, 
let her sink out 
here and then she won't tear up.' I said, 'Well, you want me to 
head for Cohansey?' He says, 
'Yeah, 
if you can get her up to 
Cohansey, why go ahead.' So I opened her up and I headed for the 
Cohansey and the Coast Guard & the Marine Police was supposedly 
a—bringin' me a pump & well, she got enough water in her belly 
and stuff so that she was listin'. Well, I had a little pile of 
oysters. 
The men they was scared, so was I, 
but they wanted to 
jump overboard and I said, 'Look. 
There's no reason for you to 
jump overboard. 
If we sink, you can get away from her and 
if we 
can make it to the Cohansey, 
if she sinks, you can stand on top 
of the pilot house and you won't even get your feet wet.' 
'Cause 
there wasn't any water there. So, I put them on the deck with 
shovels & she listed too far to one side, I would make 'em shovel 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel logs 
page 70 
the oysters on the other side 'til 
she righted herself. 
That's 
how much water she had. 
Well, I kept on a—runnin', & when I come 
across, went across the Cohansey oyster bed, a boat, when it's 
runnin' hard pushes water ahead of 
it. 
Well, when it gets in 
shoal water, she'll be hoppin' water, she'll push her nose up, 
which pushes 
her stern down, you know, She tries slide up over, 
what she's doin', she's actually compressin' water against the 
bottom. So, they say the stern goes down, which it does, but 
actually what it's 
is your bow pushin' up. And what happened there 
was, as soon as I hit that high bed, just previous to goin' 
into 
Cohansey River, why she pushed her bow up and the deck went 
underneath the water, and the stern deck was runnin' up to your 
knees underwater, see. 
And they was all headed for the side, 
'Ho! 
Ho! Ho! You're all 
right!' I says. 
'You ain't got a bit o' 
water here,' I says, 
'not a bit! Just stay right where you're 
at.' And they looked at me. 
They was doubtful. 
[12.5 min.] 
Says only, well the beach was only about 
a half a block 
from 'em, and they could see 
it, 
you know? I said, 
'Look,' I 
says, 
'You stay right on here,' I says, 
'this boat ain't gonna 
sink. 
We ain't gonna lose her,' and I was lyin', I didn't know 
whether I was or not. I says, 
'As soon as we get in that creek, 
the deck'II come on top again.' I says, 
'You wait.' Well, we 
bounced on across that bed and got in the Cohansey River and when 
we did, why our bow went down and they was scared and tide, 
it 
was ebb tide, tide goin' out, and I made it clear up to 
Hitchner's Marina, up there where we was docked. 
We still didn't 
have a pump, other but I had on 'er. She run aground out in the 
middle o' 
the creek and I had, I throwed lines ashore on the 
Cohansey River up that far it's pretty narrow. 
And I drug her 
through the bottom and got her to where we could get a plank and 
get ashore and I got off of her, went up and called my wife from 
here, and I told her, I says, 
'You go down on my boat,' and I had 
a 2—inch pump on 
it, 
'and bring me a pump.' I says, 'She's just 
about holdin' 
'er own now and she's settin' on the bottom, but 
when the tide comes in, I want a little help.' 
So my wife got 
that pump over there to Greenwich to me and that's a good 45 min. 
from here before I got. 
She brought the pump on and I had 
it on 
the boat when the Marine Police come alongside with a pump, and 
it was a funny thing, most of the men 
in the Marine Police are 
oystermen and clammers and they know what the score is, 
but 
there's a couple o' 
rookies there that never seen a boat before & 
they come on board with a boarding pad and all this, that, & the 
other to write me up & this, that, & the other and go over me 
safety equipment. The guy got a hold of one of them was a woman, 
says, 
'Now, 
look. 
Don't bother this man right now until he gets 
his boat straightened away. 
Then we'll go over the what's 
necessary.' She wanted me to stop right then when me boat is 
sinkin' and answer her some questions, you know. 
Well, anyway, 
we got her pumped out and the next day we put a fire pump on her 
and I brought her down to the shipyard and we hauled her out. 
What I'd done, had the dredge had got up on 
its edge and I'd 
Lund--$3 Reel—to—reel logs 
page 71 
poked the tooth bar through her bottom and you could take both 
hands, just like that and shove it up 
in her bottom, right up 
in 
her hole in her bottom and it took 3 2—in. pumps to keep her a— 
floatin'. 
We's lucky we didn't lose her. 
But that was my first 
experience in nearly losin' a boat." 
narrative, fishing, 
ethnicity. 
15 min. 
"And the other time was my own boat and I bought a second 
hand boat I thought was a good boat. 
She was a good boat, and I 
clammed with her all spring and I went out to run me oysters and 
got a few oysters on her. 
It was rough, wind was southeast, and 
it was rough and she started feelin' funny. 
I ain't got that 
many oysters on this boat for her to be feelin' 
like that and I 
looked out at me bilge pump, me bilge pump was a—runnin'. 
Now I 
made a couple more rounds, 
it was still runnin', I said, 'Man! 
This boat feels like she got water in her,' you know, and I was 
standin' on the hatch in the pilot house, so I opened up the 
hatch and looked down and water was within 
a foot of comin' up 
through that hatch in the bottom of her. I went, 
'Holy Mackerel!' 
So I hollered and I took her out o' 
gear and hollered to the men, 
I says, 
'Get these oysters up on the bow of her, right away!,' 
and they says, 
'What?,' and they was movin' around about, 
'Yeah, 
screwball captain, he wants the oysters up on the bow, you know?' 
So they come back there, I says, 
'Get 'em up there as fast as you 
can.' 
They looked down there and seen that water, you never seen 
men move so fast in all 
your life. 
They wasn't long 
in puttin' 
those oysters up on the bow of 
'er, well, when they did, the 
water run ahead 
in 
'er and I could see 
in what had happened to 
her, she had loosened up along her horn timber & there was a 
stream o' 
water about an 
inch wide and about 2 ft. 
long comin' up 
alongside of her horn timber, there, and rough weather, that was 
what loosened her up. 
I didn't have anything to do, so I tore me 
shirt up and tore me shirt up 
into strips and got down 
in there 
and with a screwdriver and poked the crack full 
of me shirt and 
limped on 
in. 
Well, I couldn't run any more oysters with her, I 
had to haul her out & that's when I really found out how bad she 
needed repair work. 
Well, I nearly, 
if I hadn't—a known that 
that boat was feeling wrong for no more oysters than I had on 
her, I would—a lost that boat because I think that another 15 
minutes, she'd—a had enough water to sunk, 
in her, and I wondered 
to this day how I ever, well 
it was just the good Lord lookin' 
after me, that's all, 'cause 
if 
it had went up a little further, 
it'd been her blower. 
She was only 18 inches deep back there 
around the stern, and o' 
course the engine had an engine box, so 
that the water was up over her clutch, but it wasn't up where it 
would stop the engine yet. 
She was only a 40—foot boat. 
117.5 min.] She was a nice boat, she was one of the nicest boats 
to work I ever worked. 
She was flat. 
She carried the width of 
her. 
She had a lot o' 
bottom, and sea would come up on her; sea 
would go right acrost her, but she didn't do a lot o' 
rollin', 
she was steady. And that's what you want for an oyster boat."

Garvey he has now is 28 feet long by 6—foot beam. 
"I 
had a harryin' experience like that with her down there 
off o' Cape May, I didn't have a net reel at that time and I was 
fishin' with a fellow by the name o' 
Dan Hayes and he and a Sea 
Ox, a fiberglass boat, and she was mean to pull against the tide 
& he says, 
'How 'bout if we pool our nets, put 'em overboard?,' 
he says, 
'I'll put mine overboard and you put yours overboard and 
then we'll both get in your boat and tend 'em.' Well, my boat, 
that garvey'II pull a lot easier'n that that Sea Ox. 
So that's 
what we did. 
Well, 
it was slick, just as calm as 
it could be, 
real mirrory water & everything & a lot of sea—jelly, & as 
evening, gettin' towards evening & we thought, 'Well, we'll make 
the sunset set & then we'll get our nets & go on 
in.' 
We was 
rigged up with lights & stuff for night fishing. 
Then we set our 
nets and a wind come up southeast. Well, when the 
wind's blowin' 
southeast in our bay, 
it's blowin' right in from the ocean, 
blowin' right up. 
The bay lays northwest & southeast. 
So the 
sea was comin' right on 
in from the ocean and 
it really got bad, 
it got mean before we got our nets 
in, 
but we got 'em 
in, 
but we 
couldn't transfer the nets out of my boat to his boat. 
Well, I 
had 800 pound of fish and 
ice and barrels and his gear & my gear 
in her and she only had about 6 inches of freeboard, then with 
all 
that stuff 
in her and 
it was rough, 
like I say. She was 
gettin' along all 
right and when we went to put him in his boat, 
he had her tied to a stake out there. 
There was no way he could 
get 
in 
it, 
so what he done, he just stood up on the bow and just 
dived, and landed 
in his boat on his belly, you see, so he could 
get in. 
folk speech. 
120 min.I 
And then he got his engine started, and he just cut the rope 
instead o' 
tryin' to untie it, because everything was jumpin' up 
and down so bad. 
Well, we started in, well, 
it's about 2 hours 
run from where we was at. 
We started in & a squall come down out 
o' 
northwest & she was a mean one & what it was 
it was a wind 
change up, wind come northwest was what it was. Now, I don't know 
whether you know what a cross sea 
is or not, but it's when the 
seas are changin' from one direction to another & all 
the waves 
are peaked. Well, anyway, that's what happened. 
When that 
nor'wester hit, you had a southeast sea and a direct sea goin' 
one way and your wind comin' the other & while the sea was 
changin', well, I just stopped & bailed. 
That's all I could do, 
and that boat wasn't anything like a hole in the water. That's 
all 
it was, but I, 
as long as I didn't try to move her, she was 
all 
right. 
If I just let her go and mind her own business, but 
you every when it's a—blowin' 
like that you have a tendency to 
want to see if 
you can move a little bit or go ahead or creep or 
somethin' 
like that, but every time I'd go put that boat in gear, 
why a sea would come acrost her or come inside of her & 'course 
I'd have to bail 
like heck & I had the pump goin' on her and I 
only had 6 inches o' 
freeboard to begin with, so I didn't have 
much to play with & I didn't know how big the seas was, but they 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel logs 
page 73 
was a good 2 feet or 2-1/2 feet & white, all white, just solid 
white cones out there. 
After the sea got straightened around so 
it was all 
goin' the same way, then I was all 
right, I could move 
then, but for about 15 minutes, 
it was touch and go. I had 
it 
in 
me mind, I just took all 
my net buoys that I had & his & tied 
them in a bunch & they got lights that blink on 
'em, 
run off o' 
batteries,so we can find them at night. 
Now I had just had, now 
when I'm workin' by myself that blue vest down here, that's a 
personal safety device. 
It's just a vest, and I had had 
something like that all figured, 
'Well, the only thing for me to 
do 
if this boat sinks is just to hang on to them, to hang on to 
those flags, those net flags and tie meself to them. 
122.5 m 
in. I 
If I make it, I do, 
if not, 
I'll drown and they'll find me 
anyhow when they find those flags.' That's what I had 
in mind to 
do. She was all 
right and the wind come nor'west & I run on 
into 
the beach & come on up the beach. 
But I was happy when I got on 
to that beach that night. 
01' Danny, he was all 
excited, he'd 
never been 
in a blow like that before. He said, 
'Boy,' 
he says, 
'I 
thought you was a goner,' he says. 
'I 
looked & all I could see 
was you stickin' up & no boat at all!,' he says, 
'I couldn't see 
nothin' but you stickin' up!" 
Louis describes those 3 incidents as "the most fun," and 
says, "There's sump'n fun about bein' scared to death. 
That's 
the reason race car drivers gets a kick out of racin' & sump'n 
else." 
25 min. 
"One other time, I went up Cohansey River in a squall and 
seas was run 6 to 8 feet in that squall and I couldn't see. 
I 
left the ground on the sou'west line, headed for the Cohansey 
River. It was 3 o'clock in the afternoon and the wind was 
nor'west after the squall and she come down & hit us out o' 
the 
nor'west & I got to Cohansey River at 10 o'clock at night & me 
crew quit. 
I had, that boat, her bow was 6 feet high. 
Standin' 
on a float to paint, you couldn't reach the top o' 
her stem to 
paint it, that's how high her bow was and she was 65 foot long, 
and she was dippin' her bow under every sea & well, what we say 
'green water' was runnin' the length o' 
her deck & hittin' the 
pilot house & runnin' off the side of her. 
That's how rough 
it 
was. 
And my boss was inshore a little ways and the boat that he 
had was 85 foot and she was wide and she couldn't make it. 
She 
would hit the sea and then fall off. 
She didn't have enough 
wheel. 
She was just, he was runnin' her wide open & she'd hit 
the sea & the sea would stop her & she'd fall off & he had to 
turn around & go the other way, but he had to run fair sea 'til 
he had her around Egg Island Point & then he was all 
right & he 
come on 
in the Maurice River. 
Well, the main reason I was afraid 
that time, was gettin' out in the shippin' 
lane out in the 
channel, because the only thing I had to go by to run by was a 
compass. 
We didn't have any radars or any LORANs or anything 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 74 
like that on 
'em then. 
We got 'em now, but then we didn't and I 
was afraid I'd get out there in the channel and get run into with 
one o' 
those ocean going boats comin' out of Philadelphia and if 
I got too far inshore, I would—a gotten..."

Seasonality of occupations 
of baymen are discussed. In 
fall, mostly running oysters, also tonging clams from a garvey. 
He commutes up to Egg Harbor, Egg Harbor River, and near 
Tuckerton to tong clams. This continues through winter because 
Atlantic Coast bays are saltier & therefore they don't freeze as 
does Delaware Bay. 
Not much money 
in clam tonging. Those who 
don't work on big oyster boats also tong oysters in 
late fall, 
usually in an unpolluted creek. There are many marketable size 
oysters in N.J. that can't be marketed because of pollution. 
Maurice River would support all of Maurice River Twp. 
if oysters 
were marketable, but they're also too polluted. 
In order to 
market them, you need Board of Health permit to plant them (costs 
$35). 
Then you need Planter's Permit (another $35), and a 
tonger's license. 
Then you have to capture them, plant them, 
let 
them lie 30 days to be purified, then 
can be recaught & sold. So 
nobody bothers. Used to be just a 1—step operation. 
More oysters 
sold 
in shell 
locally than shucked. 
fishing, marketing. 
2.5 min. 
Only oysters sold for shucking in area are shucking houses' 
own oysters: Robbins Bros., Port Norris Oyster Co., Bivalve 
Packing Co., send 5 or 6 boats out, & what they catch are 
shucked. 
Majority of oysters caught by one—boat owners, & sold 
in shell. Southern market opened a few years ago & now most 
oysters in shell are shipped down to Maryland & Virginia. 
There 
are no places in area where oysters on the half shell are sold. 
Nearest place is at Mulford's in Tuckahoe. Clams available, but 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel

not oysters. 
No crab houses in area either & restaurants don't 
have crab sandwiches or steamed crabs, or anything. 
Most marinas 
close up 
in Nov., & aren't interested 
in summer either. 
State of 
N.J. has neglected to encourage retail seafood, as other states 
have 
it. 
Delaware Bay has a better texture of oyster than 
Chesapeake Bay, & crabs are indistinguishable. "A blue claw crab 
tastes like a blue claw crab, wherever you buy 'em." 
(animal), 
(foodways). 
5 min. 
In winter, you work the creeks & bays. 
In Peterson's case, 
he 
is hired by the day to skipper oyster boats; 
in between those 
days, he'll go tonging. In fall, he'll often go to shipyards & 
work at carpentry, "corking"(caulking), painting or whatever. 
Has a kit of caulker's tools. "That's what they are. 
They're all 
part of my equipping myself. 
Some people equip theirself with an 
education and I don't have any education other than how to work 
wi' me hands, that's all." 
May work shipyards 'til March. 
Come 
March, he'll gill net fish for shad, and weakfish "strike in" 
in 
April. "Weakfish is where the money is." 
Some money to be made 
from shad, but people tire of 
it easily. 
You could make as much 
money just saving roe from roe shad & discarding carcass. 
"There's lot o' 
money in bonin' shad, 
if you know how to do 
it, 
but it';s a tedious process." 
If shad is cooked slowly enough 
bones will 
"cook up" 
in them like a canned salmon, "you can 'cook 
the bones done.'" There's only a 2—week period when shad are 
profitable. As water warms in 
late April — early May, start to 
"drift nettin'," i.e., drifting gill nets. May is beginning of 
"bay season." 
Will spend early bay sanding & painting & getting 
boat ready to go & get seed oysters 
in state sanctuary. 
That's a 
4—week season. 
Then scrub boat up again. 
labor, occupations 
7.5 min. 
Will go fishing again in July, usually bunker fishing, as 
crabbing is then in full season & crabbers screaming for bait. 
Frozen bunkers (menhaden) shipped up from outside. 
Used as feed 
for chickens, cattle, dogs, & cats; 
in fertilizer; oil 
is used 
in 
paints. Used as vehicle for paints used on 
ironwork on salt 
water, such as RustOleum. "If you get that on bare metal, 
it'll 
stay there." Louis considers them a "misused" fish as they are an 
important part of the food chain for more valuable species. Usu. 
in July & August will go fishing in garvey, & then in Sept., 
it's 
time to run oysters again. 
Bunkers are fished with deep gill 
nets. 
You can go out & see a school of bunkers. 
You can also 
smell them as they have a distinctive smell. 
When you determine 
school's direction, you can set so that they run 
into your nets. 
This year are worth $7/ bushel for crab bait. 
10 min. 
Bunker fishing is hard work & long days. 
"I kind o' 
enjoy 
it. 
It's different, you know." May catch 4 or 5 barrels per day, 
with 8 bushels to the barrel, "At $7 a bushel you won't starve to 
death."

Describes the economy of his garvey. 
Has a 6—cylinder 
Rambler engine in her. 
Working a 16-18 hour day, burns only 
about 12 gal. of gas. "She's an amazing thing as far as fuel 
consumption." Previous boat he had used 40 gal. per day. 
Main 
drawback is you have to go slow. 
"You can't pound her 
in a sea, 
or she'll come apart with you. 
Any kind of a wood boat, you have 
to take 
it pretty easy with her." 
Nails will work through wood & 
loosen up. Garvey was built by Ed Weissberg (spelling?) 
in 
Bivalve about 60 years ago. Ed & his brother built many area 
garveys. 
Went in swamp & cut their own cedar & oak, "had 
it 
'fl itched' 
at the mill to suit them." 
"Flitched" = sawed with 
the bark left on & not planed. The "flitch" then stored in a shed 
to season for 2-3 years. 
Never used it until 
it was ready to 
use. 
Most of their boats still 
in use. "Take that boat out there 
now, 
if you take your knife and scrape the oak and cedar on her, 
she's just as bright as the day she was built." The wood does get 
brittle with age, though. If 
you drive a nail 
in 
it without 
drilling first, 
it will split. 
12.5 min. 
Has built 1 garvey himself, but built lots of bateaux for 
his father in 
law's boat livery at Thompson's Beach. At age 16, 
Louis worked for him, "runnin'," i.e., swimming or rowing out to 
boats that were tied to stakes and bringing them in and loading 
them for livery customers; helping women, kids, drunks,or anyone 
who needed help. Got $5/ day + tips. 
Some days got $35-40 in 
tips. 
Good money then, as wages only $15/ day. When he was a kid 
they were always "hungry," i.e., ambitious to work for money. As 
a small child used to get lickin's, because he wasn't allowed to 
go down & play 
in tidal ditches before he was 5 or 6 years old, 
but he would go down there and catch 
"shedder crabs" with dip 
nets & get 3c. apiece for green shedders & 5c. for ripe ones. 
They would take them down to marinas to sell for fish bait. 
personal history, children. 
15 min. 
Wouldn't get back 'til 7 or 8 p.m., around dark & would get 
a lickin'. Would have 50c. or $1, & they'd be happy. 
Also caught 
snappers & loggerhead turtles in ditches & got 35c./ lb. 
live 
weight for them. Had a big bushel basket & sometimes 1 snapper 
would fill 1 bushel basket. Kids today would do the same, except 
today everything is against the law, so kids turn to stealing to 
get what they want. crime. 
(animal). 
"Anyhow, we could go down 
in the salt marsh, where they was 
gatherin' salt hay & a 6 or 7 year old boy could get $2 a day for 
runnin' balin' wire. 
And what you did was, the old stationary 
balers used to have a board with grooves cut in 
it & then they 
had wires that were pre—cut to a length all 
there in a bundle. 
What you did was, you poked 2 wires, top & bottom, through these 
boards, then run around the other side of the baler and hooked 
'em. 
Well, then when the bale popped out, 
it would tighten the

wires up when the hay expanded, see, the compression from these 
balers. 
Well, 
if you got your wire on the wrong side of the 
board, when the bale popped out, your board was fast to the bale 
and the guy didn't like that too much, you know he had to cut the 
wire then and get his board back. But any kid that wanted to earn 
a couple bucks, all 
he had to do was go down there, well that 
eliminated a man, you know, that freed a man up for pitchin' hay 
or sump'n like that." 
Were many ways to earn money, when he was a kid, they would 
go down to the bay & haul seine. 
Would dig up an old abandoned 
boat from the meadow. 
One of them would be 
in there with a 
bucket bailing & the other one would row or push it with poles, 
while they put net out. 
Today Marine Police would arrest or fine 
you, 
if you didn't have life jacket or $75 worth of flares. 
17.5 min. 
"What they've done is they've just destroyed the youth just 
for passin' laws, as far as I'm concerned." 
Were very few 
drownings then. 
Oyster planting today discussed. 
State has done away with 
policing of grounds. 
Has let the bigger planters' associations 
& shucking houses run 
everything. Bay 
is closed to those who do 
not oyster every single year. 
Used to be you could take years 
off & do something else like crabbing if 
it was a good year for 
that, but now you'd lose your eligibility for an oyster dredging 
license. "So, wherever there was money, I could work." 
Policy 
has been in effect for about 5 years, & now shucking houses are 
running short on oysters because of 
limited number of oyster 
planters still 
in the trade. 
Used to be, you'd go & get seed 
oysters in May & June. Used to be 8 weeks, now it's cut down to 
4, 
because they would deplete the beds too much in an 8—week 
season. 
20 min. 
Boats have been built up much bigger than they used to be. 
Used to be average of 40—foot boats, a 50—footer was "a great big 
boat." 
Now they have 95— & 115—foot boats, with all automatic 
machinery. 
A boat used to take a 24 man crew, now it only takes 
a 4 man crew to catch the same amount of oysters. 
So season cut 
down to 4 weeks & oysters planted out in the bay on grounds 
leased from State of N.J. Grounds are all surveyed by sextant & 
corners marked & records kept. 
Lease renewable each year on 1 
January, for $1.50/ acre. 
You can lease as many acres as you 
want that aren't already claimed. You can stake out area that you 
want & they'll come out and survey it & record the corners & you 
pay $1.50/ acre for the acreage that they record. 
Seed oysters 
gotten from state owned sanctuary. 
There's no limit to no. 
of 
seed oysters you are allowed to catch 
in 4 weeks. 
Last license 
Peterson bought was $5 per tonnage of your boat, so a 12—ton boat 
would cost $60 to 
license. License fee varies, 
is sometimes $8/ 
ton.

If you planted oysters already marketable size, you can 
market them right away. 
If you plant oysters that nobody wants 
to buy because of size, you have to 
let them grow up. 
Usually 
you plant them in May or June, 
let them lay for 1 or 2 years & 
over 3 years you would have 1 vacant plot to plant every year. 
So then you would be running 3 year old oysters all the time. 
If 
you run them the same year you plant them, you only need 1 
ground. 
That is, you'd be catching marketable size oysters on 
state sanctuary & you could leave them on the ground until Sept., 
but now you can even market them in summer if you want. 
When 
they're gone, you have to go tonging.

Recently market has developed for diamondback turtles, which 
has its own season. 
They can be dredged out of soft mud in 
creeks while hibernating. 
Worth about $3 apiece for 6—in.

Also used for soup, especially in N.Y.'s Chinatown. 
Can't tell the difference between diamondback soup & snapper 
soup. 
Diamondbacks used to be protected, but have made a 
spectacular comeback, so that there's an open season on them now.

25 min. 
Old—timers used to bootleg diamondbacks. 
Grandfather was 
caught during Depression bootlegging diamondbacks to Delaware. 
During 1930s, diamondbacks with 6—in. belly shells, were $60/ 
dozen & that was when $1.50/ day or even $5/ week were typical 
wages. 
Was caught shipping a boatload of them to Delaware. 
Got 
out of 
it by pleading to the judge that he was broke, had 9 kids 
to feed, and suddenly got a market for diamondback turtles. "He 
was pretty sharp old boy, Grandpa Bart!" 
"I don't think that you consciously know anything. 
I think 
living around this area & growin' up around it, your senses 
become used to 
it or something, because you take my father in 
law 
moved down here 
in 1950 & he couldn't get over the fact that 
every native down here, when the wind changed, noticed it."

G—Heislerville; 38GT 
Talks about a local science teacher named Al Massey, who had 
an oceanography class at the 
local high school & tried to get 
oystermen to take his class out on a boat so that they could 
learn about marine organisms, but got no cooperation, except from 
Louis Peterson. His daughter Margaret was in the class & arranged 
it. Louis' boss objected because of 
insurance, so he took them 
out on his own on a Saturday and dredged a worn out bed. 
Did 
this for several years. 
Is amazed at the objections of other 
oystermen to the idea of teaching young people. Massey has 
strongly influenced Peterson's children , who are now, thanks to 
his influence, well educated, unlike their father. Describes 
education & careers of his daughters. Massey got Louis' youngest 
daughter, Sandy, interested 
in microbiology, he wants her to 
study Delaware Bay microbiology. 
2.5 min. 
State's policies are eliminating the independent oysterman. 
47 boats stand to 
lose their license because they didn't buy a 
1983 license. This is 
in direct contradiction to reasons for laws 
which were 
instituted to preserve the historical fleet. 
Eventually the only oysterboats working will be those owned by 
the big oyster companies & packing houses. In 1971, was no 
Southern market, so they had to sell to 
local shucking houses & 
Louis got $5.40/ bushel for oysters. 
A man who was a shell 
trader found out about Southern market & started paying $8/ 
bushel, & Louis eventually got $8.50/ bushel. 
So 
local shucking 
houses had to start paying higher, so oystermen prospered. 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel logs 
page 82 
Previous to that, shucking houses ran their own oysters first & 
then bought extra demand from independents, & if they weren't 
needed, 
independent was stuck with unsaleable oysters. Now oyster 
beds badly depleted, as independents are selling oysters down 
south, & the shucking houses can't plant enough oysters to keep 
their demand satisfied. 
5 min. 
Now the bay 
is closed & independents don't have access. 
New 
"clutch law" goes into effect at end of October 1983, 
"to keep 
track of your 'clutch' 
of oysters," you can now only land oysters 
at a shucking house. 
This gives shucking houses control of all 
landing sites & gives them control of Shell Tax program, which 
is 
35c./ bushel shell tax for every bushel of oysters caught in 
Delaware Bay. 
There are times when 50 c./ bushel 
is all the 
profits you make on a bushel. 
It costs $4 to raise a bushel of 
oysters. It costs $2/ bushel to catch him & you have to catch him 
twice, as seed and market oyster. A man with a 40 or 50 foot 
boat, who plants 3000 bushels/ year, 
it's a good year. 
If he 
only gets &5/ bushel & out of that only makes $1/ bushel profit, 
he hasn't made more than $3000 in a year. 
This is a good year & 
they've been getting $10/ bushel, so that would be $30,000, then 
you can afford to pay your 35c./ bushel shell tax, but if price 
goes down, not so. 
government, fishing. 
7.5 min. 
State is making it harder to hold on to licenses, for 
instance, you can't transfer a license from 1 boat to another. 
You can't just go & buy a license, because access is closed. Law 
says anyone that didn't have license previous to 1979, 1980, & 
1981 
is not allowed to work the bay. 
It also stipulates that you 
must replace your boat with an equal tonnage boat or one that's 
smaller. 
So 
if you lose a boat, 
it's hard to find one that's 
exactly the same size as a replacement, so you end up having to 
get a smaller one, & then 
if 
later you find one that's the same 
size they won't upgrade your license for it. License is 
considered an asset, so you can sell 
it, but only 
if you put boat 
in the seller's name, 
let him transfer the license to 
it & let 
him sell the boat and license. 
Louis went to try to transfer a 
license from a friend of his who was retiring to Florida & 
offered to give him his license. 
To do this, he would have to 
get a lawyer, put the boat in his friend's name, and then have 
his friend retransfer the boat back to him with the license, so 
it ends up being "a 
lot o' paperwork & a lot o' 
bunk!." All 
done 
to discourage the independent oysterman. Nothing being done to 
build up business. 
10 min. 
Shells haven't been planted 
locally to catch the growth. 
They allow you to take up 20% shells, so that means that very 
year, oystermen take up 1/5 of the shells, eventually there'll be 
no shells on the bed for young oysters to grow on. 
Shells are a 
commodity themselves & many are sold to out of state buyers, 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel logs 
page 83 
especially to Connecticut, where they are planted 
in Long Island 
Sound. 
Shells also used for leaching fields of cesspools, & 
along the riverbank to prevent erosion. "There's nothing that'll 
hold any better than a shell bank. That's better than concrete or 
anything else. 
If you shell your bank, the shells lay so close 
and the tide don't 
move 'em, that a good shell bank 
is a thing 
to be desired, because it'll be there for years & years & years." 
Years ago shells were ground for lime for fields, & laws were 
passed to prevent that so that they would be put back 
in the bay. 
Old timers knew value of planting shells, but younger generation 
doesn't. 
Peterson believes that in about 10 years, only oyster 
companies' boats will be working the bay. 
Meeting 1 November to 
determine licensing & those that don't buy a 1983 dredging 
license will not be given the option to license when they want to 
work. The 47 that haven't licensed this year, 
it's because they 
didn't make any money, or they would be licensing their boats. 
So while they were recovering from financial difficulties, the 
state has a chance to get rid of them. 
12.5 min. 
There's considerable bribery going on to 
influence 
legislation & enforcement. 
Government not knowledgeable & are 
being hoodwinked by corrupt people. 
Louis's grandfather didn't 
want power put on boats, & told his boys, "All right, they give 
you power, you want to get yourself a boat, because they'll catch 
'em all & then you won't have no oysters." 
Had he 
lived 1 more 
year, he would have seen bay closed due to overfishing. 
Grandfather said, "Every boat that's got power can get on every 
high bed where a sailboat can't get, because a sailboat had to 
have a centerboard & a deep keel 
or she's upset." In old days, 
they would dredge with centerboard down & when centerboard hit 
bottom, they'd have to turn or they'd run aground. 
After power 
allowed, anybody with a 10 or 20 foot boat with power on it could 
oyster anywhere. 
With a sailboat you could go back & forth in 
the exact same places, because you had to tack, so you always 
left some oysters behind. 
With a power boat, you can go 
anywhere, around in circles, or whatever, & dredge until bed 
"ain't nothin' but a black hole when you get done." 
Grandfather's predictions came true. So state went up and dredged 
seed oysters at Arnold's [Point], where oystering generally 
wasn't done due to thinness of shells there, brought them down to 
the Delaware Bay & planted them.

After that was when he bought his first big oyster boat. 
He 
had a smaller one when he was 14. 
He had had a brand new 18 x 4-
1/2 foot garvey built. Cut the cedar himself & paid $5/ log to 
have 
it "flitched." Had 
it 
built by "Old Bobby" Lee, who built 
bateaux & garveys and made tongs & stales. 
He is still alive, 
but does mostly fishing now. 
He no 
longer builds boats as he is 
about 80. 
25 years ago had a heart attack & was on his deathbed. 
While recovering, he built a 14 foot bateau to do some rod & reel

man to help with the fishing on a half share basis.

17.5 min. 
Lee built the garvey for Louis. 
Total cost of lumber & 
labor was $74. Louis' 14th summer was first that he worked full 
time tonging & by the end of the summer, he was making $150/ week 
tonging. 
Would give his father $75 & keep the rest of 
it 
himself, so he "had more money than any other kid

you can go pick him up. After you grab him, he'll scratch you. 
"Well, you see 
it was against the law to do 
it, because 
actually you're trapping or catching wild game, you see with no

Well, they used to have patrol cars around here around

Original settlers in area were mostly Baptists. However, 
John Wesley once preached at the Head of the River Church 
in Head 
of the River. The church holds memorial services there once a 
year & is still 
lit by kerosene lamps. One of the preachers at 
the Head of the River Church was a Baptist, who had been pastor 
of the West Creek Baptist Church, but was let go for being too 
liberal. 
Was pastor at Head of the River Church for years, but 
when he died, couldn't be buried 
in Methodist cemetery, so he's 
buried across the road. Old West Creek Baptist cemetery is next 
to George Brewer, Jr.'s campground. 
Stone there has epitaph, "As 
you are now, I once was. As I am now, you shall surely be." The 
woman buried there was noted for her liberality; she traveled to 
Europe, etc., & died of a rare disease, causing her to be 
recorded in medical journals, along with her epitaph. 
2.5 min. 
Learned of this from local physician, Dr. Butcher, who had 
lent Louis the money to buy his property. Banks won't lend to buy 
on Maurice River floodplain, so 
financing has to be done 
privately. 
Dr. Butcher was a local source of capital for buying 
property, & when Louis went to pay his mortgage, the doc. would 
always 
"teach" him something. One time it was this business 
about the epitaph. 
Butcher well admired, and always interesting 
& "you always learned something." Louis was only 20 years old 
when he went to borrow the money. 
Recounts the transaction of 
borrowing $4000. Old dr. told Louis deer hunting tales, etc., for 
1-1/2 hours, before they got around to setting it up.

Louis didn't know that his property not under Pinelands 
Commission, so when he wanted to 
improve the land, he wrote to 
them & they sent him stacks of forms & restrictions regarding 
pulling trees or planting bushes or cutting trees without State 
permission. 
Later he found out that he wasn't in Pinelands 
Commission's jurisdiction, and that he could go ahead & do 
whatever wasn't prohibited by 
local ordinance. 
Complains about 
insensitivity of Pinelands Commission, who wouldn't even tell him 
that he was outside of their boundaries. Had bought an old 1946 
Farmall tractor when he first moved there & cleared all 
of the 
land. 
Later a man from Cape May's D.E.P. office came by with 
"before" and "after"aerial photos, which showed work he had done. 
More than 10 years later, Pinelands Commission was created & 
assumed jurisdiction of nearby areas, so Louis was afraid that 
he'd run afoul of them if 
he tried to clear it again. government,

"snatch block" to pull out trees & brush. Peterson moved into the 
place in 1963. 
Place was all grown up 
in bayberries, & he 
cleared it with tractor, brush hook & ax, with help of wife & 
kids. 
Had moved there from Thompson Beach, where he had had a 9 
acre place. Had never lived anywhere else but Heislerville --
mother & father lived on East Point Rd. 
All family lived 
in 
immediate area, Peterson's Lane named after them.

fami Iy. 
10 min. 
Talks about family history & property they had held, and all 
the houses that constituted a settlement on Peterson's Lane. That 
was a sand road & you had to 
leave cars outside by the main road 
& walk out there. 
Can be seen from Matt's Landing Rd. 
When he 
was real 
little, didn't have cars. 
Remembers his father's first 
car, when Louis was 15 years old. 
12.5 min. 
Peterson's garvey ready to run, 
if he gets it sanded & 
painted. Was too busy this summer to take it fishing. 
Is waiting 
for a coat of copper & a coat of white paint. 
Bow deck needs 
caulking. 
Will probably take 
it to Egg Harbor River & go 
clamming in the sound after 1 January. 
(Jens makes request to hire the boat for a tour of the bay.) 
Would be a whole day trip 
if we went to Arnold's [Point]. 
(Discussion of cost & how to go about it.) Peterson works mainly 
within area reachable within 2 hours. Suggests renting his 
brother in 
law's boat.

His garvey, 
if 
it's available would be wet & cold. (More 
discussion of trip.) May have problems because of his purchasing 
of new oyster boat, but will be glad to do 
it. (More discussion 
of cost -- probably about $50.) If we don't use the garvey, we 
may use his brother in 
law's bateau, can probably do 
it some time 
in November. 
17.5 min. 
(More discussion of possible trip.) 
When they haul seine, 
they go by car to riverbank. Does most of his work, except for 
winter & spring on Atlantic Coast bays, 
is done between Maurice 
River Cove & Cape May. 
Does a lot of fishing down at "the 
Hammocks" & 75% of his fishing he does off West Creek. 
West 
Creek Cove very rich 
in plankton, so it's very good for shad & 
other fishing. 
Has aerial photograph that shows location of 
plankton & indicates West Creek Cove as richest in plankton of 
the whole Jersey coast. "There's nothin' that you can't catch in 
that cove." Cove has lots of weakfish, bluefish, & flounder. Once 
he even caught an amberjack there, obviously far north of 
its 
usual range in Florida. 
(animal) 
20 min. 
Can catch just about anything in a net 
in West Creek Cove. 
"You don't go up there & just murder fish, I don't want to give 
you the wrong idea." 
Sometimes you catch 100 lb., sometimes 300 
lbs., etc. 
As a steady fishing place, you end up with more, than 
the those who run all over & might catch 5000 lb. 
in one day 
somewhere else, but have to run all 
over for the next week. (More 
discussion of cost for trip.) 
22.5 min. 
"If I can get that 'scow' overboard...," he'll do 
it (Scow = 
garvey). (Noises as we haul oyster tongs around for 
photographing. 
Discussion has ended, but recorder was left on.)

[Bob Morgan]: Is this thing on? Is this thing on? Is this 
thing on? 
[Unidentified voice]: Okay, Bob. 
[B.M.1: Is this working? 
[Other unidentified voice] You want her to do that, now? 
[B.M.7: No. not now. I want her down there now, just down 
and stand right there. About a half hour from here, and you can 
sit on that, 
look, brush that off and sit right there. See that? 
Yeah, I'll have her coat cleaned afterwards. 
C0593: 
[Bob Morgan]: I guess this microphone's working, but I 
don't really need one for this small an area. Welcome to our 
party. We're very happy to be launching a brand new boat. 
It's 
the first oyster boat that's been launched on this river, I 
guess, 
in over fifty years, so we're very pleased and we're very 
glad you're here. 
Just to give you a little bit about the boat. 
The boat's seventy—five feet long, twenty—one feet wide, draws 
six feet of water. [Noise from overflying jet aircraft.] You 
can't compete with that, I don't think I want to. 
It has a three 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 90 
hundred and fifty horsepower diesel engine and we expect her to 
have a service speed of about ten knots. 
It's constructed all 
of 
steel. 
The plates are quarter inch and five—sixteenths. 
I would 
really like to, among other things, take this time to thank all 
the people who've worked on this boat. 
I'm not quite the oldest 
employee here 
in years of age, but I've been here longer than 
anybody else and I've seen a lot of people come and go and I've 
never seen a group of men work so well and so willingly as the 
people who've worked on this boat. 
I have to say that in my 
case, at least, Mr. Wheaton owns this shipyard. I've been kind of 
allowed to run 
it 
like I own 
it. I feel 
like I do, almost, and I 
really got the impression that each one of the people that worked 
on this boat felt like 
it was their boat and that's the way we 
want them to feel. So, I just have to 
let you know that. We're 
gonna open our program. 
The Reverend Sooy is going to give the 
invocation, 
if you give your attention to him, please. 
[079]: 
[Rev. Benjamin Sooy]: Let us pray. Eternal God , our Father 
in Heaven, Thou unto Who all hearts are open, all 
desires known, 
and from Whom no secrets are hid. We're rejoicing at this 
occasion, this hour that brings us together, for we realize that 
if we desire something, Thou has ordained that we must labor for 
it. We also realize that You honor honest toil, and so have we 
invoked Thy blessing, not only on the safety of this ship, but 
also on the success of 
it, praying that new life would come again 
to the oyster industry, realizing that this is the desire of so 
many. 
May it be so. 
May 
it come true, 
is our prayer. 
This we 
ask 
in the one triune name of the one triune God, and of our 
Lord, Whom we owe honor and glory, not only today, but unto the 
end of time. 
In Christ's name, we ask 
it. Amen. 
[096]: 
[B.M.1: Thank you, Reverend Sooy. I told you, I didn't think 
I needed one. 
We're gonna have the "Star Spangled Banner" sung 
by Mrs. Betty Smith, 
if you give your attention to her, please. 
[100] : 
[Mrs. Betty Smith sings the first stanza of the "Star 
Spangled Banner," followed by applause.] 
[120]: 
[B.M.]: 
If that don't give you goose pimples, you're not 
alive. 
We're very happy to have built this boat, as I said, but 
we had a fellow, a gentleman, I'd say, who did the design work on 
the hull and we expect it to float very nicely, but just in case 
it don't, I'm gonna introduce you to the architect, so you'll 
know who designed this thing, Mr. George Meese. [Applause.] 
As I 
told you, as far as we're concerned, this is a party. 
We've 
invited our friends, of which you are one, an we've got some more 
friends. 
Since all 
of you can't talk, we're just gonna let a few 
people, who are used to doing it, 
talk, and one of our friends 
who's gonna talk is Mr. Ed Salmon, who's a member of the Board of 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel logs 
page 91 
Freeholders. 
Ed, we've only got twenty minutes, so... 
1132]: 
[Frank Wheaton]: The tide's going out. 
[Edward Salmon]: Frank Wheaton said, "The tide's running 
out, so be short." But it's certainly a pleasure to be here to 
represent, along with Director Fisher, the Cumberland County 
Board of Chosen Freeholders. 
Someone in the audience said to me, 
"This 
is a big day for Dorchester." It certainly is and it's also 
a big day for Cumberland County and for our fishing 
and oyster 
industries. 
We've had a couple of extremely unique and 
beneficial events happen in Cumberland County, the last several 
months, this being one of them, the other being the dedication of 
our Marine Research Laboratory in Bivalve, and we believe with 
this and that, we're gonna have a rebirth of our fishing 
and 
oystering industries, and Mr. Wheaton was very kind to donate the 
land for the Research Laboratory. 
Every meeting we held, Bob 
Morgan was there to make sure things got done properly and we're 
also indebted, 
for today we're christening a boat in honor of 
Mr. Morgan's father, and I see Mrs. Morgan is here to christen 
that boat and 
it certainly is a big day for us. 
Now, Bob Morgan 
said, "When you speak, Ed, follow your mother's advice," and my 
mother's advice 
in giving a public speech was, "To stand up tall 
so everyone would see you; speak loudly, so everyone would hear 
you, and also sit down quickly, so everyone would like you," and 
I'm going do just that and congratulations! [Applause.] 
C1471: 
[Bob Morgan]: Thank you, Ed. 
I'd 
like to present you now, 
the Director of the Cumberland County Board of Freeholders. 
Everybody, his name's Charles, but I don't think he knows what it 
is, 
it's Chuck. 
So we're expecting Chuck Fisher to come up and 
say a few words. [Applause.] 
1150]: 
[Charles Fisher]: Thank you, Bob. I'd certainly like to 
congratulate you and like to echo the things Ed Salmon said about 
Bob Morgan, and I think that one of the things that's most 
significant is the Oyster Lab and this synonymous, and 
if 
it 
weren't for the thrust of Bob Morgan, neither one of them, 
in my 
opinion, would've happened. So, Bob, on behalf of all 
the people 
in Cumberland County, I would like to present you with this 
proclamation. I'd like to read it, 
it says, 
Launching the "Robert C. Morgan oyster boat symbo— 
lizes the revival of the oyster industry. Whereas, 
"Robert C. Morgan," the first oyster boat to be 
built in more than half a century, 
is being launched 
Saturday, November the fifth, Nineteen eighty three, 
at the Dorchester Shipyard, and whereas this addi— 
tion to the fleet of oyster boats symbolizes the re— 
vival of an industry, which has historic roots in 
the area predating the first European settlers here, 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 92 
and whereas the ship 
is named for one of the most, 
for one of the premier oystermen of Cumberland Coun— 
ty, who was instrumental 
in the development of more 
scientific methods of oyster farming, and whereas 
his son with the same name played a major role in 
the development of the new boat, now therefore, be 
it proclaimed, by the Cumberland County Board of 
Chosen Freeholders, as follows, that this boat hails, 
that this Board hails the launching of the "Robert C. 
Morgan," and wishes it many years of fruitful ser— 
vices in Delaware Bay. Special appreciation is exten— 
ded to Bob Morgan for carrying on the traditions of 
the industry in the footsteps of his father. 
Some 
men are dreamers, some are doers, Bob Morgan is both. 
Bob? [Applause.] 
[172]: 
[B.M.7: That's very nice. [Applause.] Thank you. [Applause.] 
That's a little embarrassing, but very nice. Thank you. 
One of 
the other big supporters that the oyster industry has had here 
in 
Cumberland County 
in New Jersey, has been our State Senator, who 
is a very good friend of mine and I'd like to present to you now, 
Senator Jim Hurley. [Applause.] 
[177]: 
[Sen. James Hurley]: I thank you very much, Bob. Good 
morning, 
ladies and gentlemen. 
I like these historic occasions. 
In my sixteen years at Trenton , I've had a resident expert on 
oyster, on the oyster business at my side or, at least, on the 
other end of the telephone. Every time we had any piece of 
legislation came up, or was about to come up, or we thought 
should come up, I called Bob Morgan and he always responded and 
gave me the best advice and it's that kind of help that you need, 
when you are an unknowing legislator in Trenton. 
A few years ago 
I had a real thrill. 
I was invited to participate in the annual 
skipjack race on the Chesapeake, that goes out of the City Dock 
at Annapolis, and 
it was fun. 
If you know what the skipjack is, 
the sailboats that took oysters in the Chesapeake Bay, and each 
year they hold the race the last Saturday in October and each 
year the number of skipjacks gets fewer and fewer, but it was 
great to be there and it's great to 
look back, but I couldn't 
help, driving here today, thinking that even though it's fun to 
look back, unfortunately here 
in Cumberland County, we've looked 
back too often, perhaps, and that's why I'm so proud to be here 
today and to congratulate Mr. Wheaton, Mr. Morgan, because the 
launching of this ship 
is a look forward, a look forward into the 
future of what we want Cumberland County to be, and particularly, 
what we want the Maurice River Valley to be. 
I salute you, Bob 
Morgan and Frank Wheaton for a job well done and wish you well. 
[198]: 
[B.M.7: Thank you. [Applause.] You know, fellows, all 
those 
nice things you said about me may have cost me my job, [laughter] 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel logs 
page 93 
because the man that owns this place and 
is the guiding light 
behind it, 
and I never forget that, and who has really made up 
many of the spitballs that I've been able to throw, Chuck, 
[laughter] sometimes it does stay 
in the background, but he has 
been the man that I have looked to and I'm gonna tell you, he's a 
great man. I'm gonna tell him that, today, 
in front of all 
you 
people. Frank, I'd like you to come and say a few. [Applause.] 
120 61 : 
[Frank H. Wheaton, Jr.]: Good morning, everyone. 
This 
is a 
real proud day. 
I really didn't think that Bob had the clout to 
have that airplane go over right at the right time, but he timed 
it just right. 
You must know the Navy, 
is all I can say. And I'm 
very happy that Bob invited me, too, far as that's concerned, 
[laughter] because, really, I guess outside the financial end of 
it, Bob really does own the shipyard. 
Without Bob, I wouldn't 
know what to do with the shipyard. 
He has done a fabulous job 
over the years and when things get a little rough up 
in the glass 
plant, why, I come down and relax down here with Bob 
in the 
shipyard. It's an entirely different atmosphere. I'm extremely 
proud of the people that put this ship together. 
I was 
in 
Norfolk three days ago, and they have all kinds of marine 
railways and ships down there and they were asking me atone of 
the railways, "Do you have anybody that can caulk a ship or caulk 
a deck?" I said, "We have people that can do anything," and we 
really have some wonderful people here that have dedicated their 
life to the shipyard and I really didn't have much to do with 
this. 
This was Bob's idea and I, 
of course, would like very much 
to see the oyster business grow. What bothers me 
is the fact that 
being a salesman, we can't go out and sell, because we have more 
orders than we can fill, now. 
If Doctor Haskin does the job which 
I am anticipate he's gonna do 
in the new Research Laboratory, we 
may find reasons to have more oysters than we've had over the few 
years. 
It's just a pleasure to be with you all, today, and Bob, 
I congratulate you for the job you've done. [230]: 
[B.M.]: Thank you. [Applause.] There's one more little piece 
of work we have to do before we christen this boat and launch it 
and these are the Boat Papers, the Coast Guard says it's a boat, 
'cause we have document here that says so and while Frank and I 
had something to do with building this boat, somebody else will 
have something to do with whether or not it makes money, and that 
fellow is Captain Jimmy Gale. 
I'm gonna turn these papers over 
to you, Jimmy. [Applause.] 
[236]: 
[Capt. Jimmy Gale]: Don't look for any 
long speeches. 
[Applause.] 
[B.M.7: The problem's all 
yours, now. 
[Capt. J.G.1: Okay, thank you. [Applause.] 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel logs 
page 94 
[B.M.1: Now, I'm gonna ask a very nice lady to come up here 
accompanied by another nice lady, both of which are closely 
allied with me. 
One, my mother, Mrs. Ada Morgan, who's come here 
to accompany my wife, Claire. 
Mother we're gonna... [applause] 
that thing that there. We're gonna let you hit that with both... 
Not 'til I tell 
you! Because I want to be out of the way. 
[Laughter.] 
[Mrs. Ada Morgan]: I'm anxious. [Laughter.] 
[B.M.7: We're gonna let you hit right in here, somewhere, 
with both hands, and hit it hard, and let me move. 
[Mrs. A.M.]: Tell me when. 
[B.M.1: Any time you want, go and hit it hard. 
[246]: 
[Crash, as bottle breaks, followed by cheers, hoorays, and 
applause.] 
[Unidentified voice]: Claire? Claire? Claire! That was a 
good shot at 
it. 
[Bob Morgan]: Now anybody that's on this platform will have 
to move back. 
[Same unidentified voice]: Claire? No question about that, 
Bob, that was christened. [Laughter.] 
253: 
[Recorded martial music resumes, also engine noise of 
shipyard crane removing staircase from the "Robert C. Morgan."] 
303: 
[Noise of chain drive of 
launching platform.] 
327: 
[Capt. Jimmy Gale, over the "Robert C. Morgan's" p.a. 
system]: If anyone is interested, after the boat is 
launched, 
we're gonna give boat rides at the dock 
in back of the blue 
building, here, 
if anyone 
is 
interested, we can take twenty—five 
to thirty people at a crack, so 
if anybody's interested, we'll 
give rides 
in back of this blue building. 
[More martial music and crowd noise.]

"...CIt would] be 
late 
in the fall and I was pullin' up a 
pot and I didn't know whether to drop it 
in the water again or 
pull 
it on 
in, because the bottom o' 
the pot was full of, I 
wasn't, what, sure what when I first pulled it up and what it 
was, 
it was this tremendous big eel 
and then I checked around and 
I found out's what they call 
'winter eel' and, oh, that thing 
must'a been, oh, oh, three foot long, and I would say was about, 
about like that in diameter, so I had to try 
it, I brought it, 
though, home and it was large enough, I staked it, and 
it was 
excellent eating, but I hadn't run 
into one like that." 
(foodways), 
(animal). 
CJ.L.7: "Well, that's pretty big." 
CG.C.1: "It was! It was a monstrous eel." 
Discussion of eel 
breeding in Atlantic Ocean. 
CG.C.]: "But they, they, evidently they breed around here, 
if 
you, 
as you come into my yard, you see this little pond? Okay? 
One year I decided to, oh, drain that out and I was gonna dig the 
lower end out for, you know, for deeper reasons, and I had a 
diesel pump out there, pumpin' 
it, 
and I looked out and all 
of a 
sudden this pump goin' 
'wrow!, wrom!' 
I thought, 
'What 
in the 
world could'a plugged that pump?,' so I went out and pulled up 
the suction end, and 
it was completely plugged with eels about 
the size of pencil, so they've had to breed in there, and they've 
had to get in there by birth, because I didn't stock 'em in 
there, and there was just thousands of 
'em 
in there, and, you 
know, they had to been bred to get in there." 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel logs 
page 96 
Enjoyed establishing a pay pond on his property for tourists 
to go crabbing, because he was the first or only person to do 
that. 
Got the idea from his pheasant preserve. 
Pheasants bought 
& released for gunners. First thought about starting pay pond for 
striped bass. 
Back when bass were netted commercially, a 
fisherman used to put undersize bass in George's canal, but there 
wasn't a sufficient supply, so he forgot about it and went to 
stocking his pond with crabs, so they crabbed commercially in the 
Bay & put crabs 
in pond. 
Has pond set up with pipe to 
let tide 
flow in and out. 
fishing, hunting, recreation. 
2.5 min.. 
"About 4, maybe 5 years after I put the first 'striped' 
bass in there, we had a big storm go through here. 
We had, I 
think, about 11 
inches of rain 
in one day and there's a little 
pond up back o' 
here called Cedar Lake and the dam broke, and 
everything went instant fresh, okay? 
I had a lot o' 
crabbers on 
the bank over here and I heard 'em a—hollerin' and carryin' on 
and I went over there and these bass that I had put in there 
several years before was coming up to the surface and they was, 
oh, 
they had to weigh 25, 30, 40 pounds, tremendous! And the 
heads on them was so big, people was tryin' to, oh, get 'em out 
with the crab nets and they was breakin' their nets, you know, 
tryin' to get 'em, and they took some of 
'em home and then the 
other ones I was able to get I throwed over in the creek, so they 
could go out with the tide, so they would survive, but they had 
grown in there beautiful fish, big, beautiful fish and they was 
real thick and heavy 
in the body. 
I think they was thicker and 
heavier in the body than some of 
'em that you would catch 
in the 
Bay. I don't know whether it's 'cause they didn't have to work as 
hard, you know, to feed or what, but they was, 
it was a different 
experience that I'd had, with that." 
D .L. mentions striped bass' ability to 
live 
in fresh water, as 
well 
as salt.] 
CG.C.]: "Oh, yeah, but this, yeah, they do, but this was an 
instant change and that's why they came to the top. 
I lost all 
my crabs in the canal and but 
if you have a gradual change, you 
know, 
like they did down 
in Santee, down 
in South Carolina, well, 
they adapt, but this wasn't that. 
It was salt water one moment 
and within one day's time, 
it was all fresh and they couldn't 
change that quick." 
Started pay pond about 10 years ago. Ran 
it for about 5 
years. 
The bitter winter of 1977 decimated the local crab 
population. 
Mr. Campbell believes that this 
is due to the fact 
that the Bay froze, and that when saltwater ice begins to thaw, 
it gets "rotten" and sinks to the bottom. 
The sunken ice would 
then have smothered the crabs that were hibernating in the mud. 
After that the pay pond was out of business, but about 2 years 
ago, the crab population started making a comeback, and so he 
started up the pay pond again. 
He has, however, had to 
supplement his crab supply with crabs from Maryland, because the 
population has not yet recovered enough. 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel logs 
page 97 
"The whole bay froze up and you could go down on my bay 
shore and you could see pressure ridges out there would look like 
mountains, and I've always felt that when that ice got -- salt 
ice gets 'rotten' and sinks -- and I've always felt, when 
it 
sunk, 
it just smothered all 
the crabs out, that was, you know, 
they go down 
in the mud, not too deep, but they bury 
in the mud 
and when that ice come over 'em, well just smothered 'em out." 
Now they are gradually coming back. 
5 min. 
Has commercial crab pots which he sets off West Creek & 
catches them to put in the canal. 
Campers & tourists catch them. 
They have picnic tables etc. for them. Preferred by families with 
young children, as they don't have to worry about restlessness, 
as they would in a small boat. Campbell doesn't crab for market. 
Only does it before Labor Day, as tourist season then ends. 
October & early November has some of the best crabbing in the 
Bay, as crabs have grown all 
season. 
Softshells available only 
during warm weather, as crabs don't molt after it gets cold. 
Crabs now getting ready to "bed down." When he's potting crabs 
in 
summer, especially during full moon (which is main shedding 
time), he will bring home the softshells & have them for 
breakfast.

Campbell's grandfather was a salt hay 
harvester in Dividing Creek. 
His father was in the business all 
of his life and George "just grew up in 
it." 
(plant) 
7.5 min. 
Salt hay CSpartina sp.] consists of several species of 
native grass, blended into a batch. One species is rosemary, 
which has 
hollow core, has a blade & a very small 
leaf at the 
top. Yellow salt CSpartina patens] 
is 
"the real salt hay." It 
grows about one to 1-1/2 feet in height. 
Has a very fine stem, 
with no 
leaf. Salt hay was especially good for packing bricks, 
because it was fine enough to keep bricks from riding uneven. 
Was preferable to straw, because vibrations of bricks being 
transported would powder straw, but not salt hay. Now bricks are 
strapped and forklifted, so that market no 
longer exists. 
Salt 
hay 
is dying business, due to progress in packing. 
He used to 
sell 
loads of 
it to the Carborundum Co. for use 
in packing 
ceramics. 
Factory had a big shop to just build wooden crates, 
and another in which men with paddles packed ceramics in crates 
together with salt hay. At that time more efficient packing 
methods were already known. 
After a new manger appointed, they 
stopped buying salt hay. 
Main uses for salt hay are for cement work, to keep concrete 
from curing too fast in summer or 
in winter to keep it from 
freezing. "You can pour concrete in pretty bitter weather and put 
salt hay on 
it and 
it will keep." 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel logs 
page 98 
"For example, one year we had a big snow, and I had quite a 
bit o' 
hay on top o' 
some bales. I went up top and just rolled 
it 
off, okay, with the snow all mingled in with it and I didn't get 
back there, I went back in June, the first part o' 
June, okay?, 
and broke that hay apart and inside of that salt hay 
it wasn't in 
the form o' 
snow, but it was still 
all 
ice crystals in there in 
that and that show you the insulation value. It amazed me and I 
knew it would do this, but it still amazed me when I seen it 
in 
that long a period o' time." 
10 min. 
Another species is sedge grass, which isn't intentionally 
cut as much, because it rots quicker, and it has so high a salt 
content that it's hard on the machinery. It grows in a lower 
elevation than other salt hay. Yet another species is black 
grass, which is very fine & grows only early 
in spring, before 
other species come up. Must be cut before July, or 
it gets oily & 
curly & thereby useless. Black grass grows on the higher meadow. 
Highest meadow has black grass; next elevation is regular salt 
hay, then rosemary, then sedges. 
Elevations are varying only in 
inches. 
Meadows look flat, but there are variations in 
elevation. 
Black grass cut in spring. 
Rosemary and "regular grass" cut 
at same time. 
All 
hay sold together. Use of salt hay 
in caskets 
was tried, but it produced an odor and a bug problem. Clarence 
Berry 
in Port Norris is 
in salt hay business & also manufactures 
casket mattresses, so he tried using it 
in place of excelsior, 
but it wasn't practical. 
Salt hay also used for sewer work. 
Salt hay put on top of stone bed & covered with dirt. Salt hay 
will still 
be there 5 or 6 years later. Fresh hay or straw would 
rot. 
Salt hay lets bed breathe, allowing moisture to come up 
through top of ground. If they use tar paper, moisture will 
go 
down through the ground. 
12.5 min. 
Used to sell salt hay to pottery companies and brickyards. 
Years ago they used to sell 
it to farmers for sweet potato beds. 
During Depression, his father sold it for banana boats. Used to 
deliver loads of salt hay to banana piers in Philadelphia. 
Gaynor 
Glass Co. used to pack large glass containers in 
it. At age of 
16, George started delivering hay to glass co. 
It's not market that's declining as much as supply, due to 
natural changes in meadows. "Mother Nature's gonna put us out of 
business long before we 
lose our market." Decline of meadows 
started with the big storm (hurricane) of 1950. A tidal wave that 
came 
in & destroyed the natural banks along the shore. 
From then 
on, they had to use cranes to build up banks and put in sluices 
to control water. Used to be that full moon tides would deposit a 
layer of silt once a month over the meadows, thereby fertilizing 
and shoring up elevation. 
weather. 
15 min. 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 99 
Since the 1950 destruction of the banks, control of 
elevation and flooding has had to be artificial, and 
it has never 
been quite adequate. This is aggravated by the fact that tides 
in 
general have been higher & higher in recent years. "So we're not 
raising the meadows up as the tides is growin' higher out here, 
so we're havin' to hold more & more water out of the meadows with 
the [artificial] banks and it's getting, the economics is getting 
to the point that we're not gonna be able to do 
it too much 
longer. 
It's going fast. I just keep running from one hole to 
another now on my cranes." 
Salt hay 
is all 
natural growth, which is 
regulated by water 
levels. 
If meadows get too wet, 
it goes to sedge, & bottom also 
gets too soft to support equipment. Salt hay forms root system 
that can support heavy machinery, which does, of course, have to 
have big balloon tires. If meadow gets too dry, upland weeds get 
in 
and crowd 
it out, "and it's not meadow anymore." Control of 
water levels 
is critical factor. Farming = control of water 
levels in the salt hay business. All main creeks have sluices to 
let water in, when necessary. 
17.5 min. 
If meadows aren't harvested for about 2 or 3 years, bottom 
gets too soft, so meadow has to be burned off 
in order to get air 
down to root system in order to encourage it to thicken & firm 
up. George hasn't had to do 
it much in recent years as he's kept 
his stuff pretty well harvested. Main burning done now is on 
ditch banks to keep vegetation from interfering with drainage 
from meadows. 
Campbell operates along the bay from Port Norris & 
G—Heislerville; 38GT to G—Eldora; 34GT. Locally, he harvests on his 
own 
land. State's new riparian maps may result in State claiming 
land that has been 
in Campbell's family for generations. In Port 
Norris, they used to own land, which they sold to state for a 
hunting preserve, but retained haying rights. 
In Heislerville 
area they pay a fee to harvest state hunting preserve lands. 
Occasionally pays area private landowners to harvest their 
meadows. Occasionally buys a standing crop, but generally just 
pays an annual amount for haying rights on a given tract. 
Years 
ago, used to buy standing hay by the harvested ton. 
Now standing 
hay bought by the harvested bale. government. 
20 min. 
Salt hay 
is much finer than ordinary "fresh hay," so 
it 
sheds water that would penetrate "fresh hay." Water can only 
penetrate to 2 or 3 inches in salt hay. Salt hay has a heavy salt 
content which helps preserve it. 
Walking through meadows makes 
your shoes white with salt. 
Harvesting today is mechanized. When he started, 
it was 
still done with horses & pitchforks. Subsequent to that, 
it was 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel

done for years with self propelled windrowers, which cut it & 
swathed it at the same time. He now uses tractor—pulled 
windrowers. 
Then baler comes 
in and bales it. 
All equipment has 
large balloon tires to keep from sinking, and he uses small 
tractors with four wheel drive. Tractor pulls windrower, baler, 
and wagon. Only time 
it 
is manhandled is when it 
is loaded in 
wagon. 
technology. 
22.5 min. 
Has a forklift with attachment called a bale farmhand, with 
a set of hooks that can pick up 10 bales at a time and stack them 
in a pile or load them on a truck. Ezra Cox of Heislerville has a 
specially modified trailer than can carry load to the customer 
and push it all 
off automatically upon arrival. So hay 
is only 
"touched by human hands" once now. 
This is 
an advantage, due to 
the impossibility of finding people willing to work in salt 
haying, which "has always been a hard, dirty job, and a lot of 
people don't care to do 
it and a few of us 
is crazy and we 
love 
it... and you do develop a love for it. 
I'm not ashamed to admit 
it. 
Last year I was down on my bay shore down here, my bank had 
broke, you know. I stood there and cried 'cause I seen a way of 
life leavin', you know, that I'd loved and you can only fight 
Mother Nature for so 
long and she's gonna win and I know she's 
gonna win." 
Very little salt haying on the Atlantic Coast. He now knows 
of one salt haver on the coast, who 
is near New Gretna. 
Used to 
be more, but putting in 
of Mystic Isles & other big subdivisions 
ate up much of available salt meadow. 
The worthless plant species that is most competitive to salt 
hay 
is phragmites, which has spread considerably since the 1950 
storm. 
Native reeds would only grow in 
isolated spots. 
Since 
the storm, phragmites, which used to flourish only up near 
Wilmington, has been spreading locally ever since. 
Phragmites 
can adapt to any water level, which gives it a competitive 
advantage. (plant), weather. 
25 min. 
Phragmites is a very tall grass also called foxtai1. Very 
common all over near wetlands, both fresh and salt. All meadows 
up near Salem have been taken over by phragmites. 
He cuts back 
phragmites to control 
it as much as he can. 
Had tried to control 
it with herbicide, but it was too expensive and "when something 
did come back, the phragmites come back before anythin' else." So 
he tried it for about 2 years & then he gave up.

"Up Jersey, goin' 
up the Parkway, one place I cross and I 
forget what it's near there's a beautiful salt marsh and I've 
always, you know, would love to get a blade into 
it 'cause 
it has 
beautiful salt hay, but, and 
it used to be cut years ago but back 
to the same thing, you know. They started gettin' factories up 
in 
there and people go work 
in the factory and make so much more 
money so much easier that they, you know, walked away from salt 
hay business." 
(plant) 
Description of salt haying before it was mechanized: 
"Well, you went in there. We mowed it with a horse and then 
we took another horse and we raked it with the old dump rake and 
we'd rake 
it 
into windrows and then you'd turn around and reverse 
and put in what we called 'cocks' and then we come 
in with the 
horses again, with the old wooden 'shovel—'uns' that, you've seen 
pictures of 'em, years ago and we'd pitch it all 
on the wagons 
and bring 
it ashore & then we'd put it 
in big stacks, 
loose. 
Well, there we got pretty mechanized. 
We had a whole boom with a 
cable on 
it with an old Hettinger engine on that we had forks on. 
We would lift it off o' 
the wagons 
in big forkfuls, okay?, and 
stack 
it and then all winter we had of stationary balers, we'd 
pull along from bent to bent and bale it 
in the big ol', big of 
three wire stationary bales. And back 'en we'd still used to sell 
quite a bit loose, also and so, and we started on what I call my 
Cabin Marsh, my father used to go down there and bring it up on 
scows and boat it up creeks and, you know, to get it ashore."

Had mud roads that led through marshes to lead to where 
scows were unloaded. 
2.5 min. 
Back then practically all tasks were done manually. 
They 
employed 8 to 10 men, now employs 4 & gets more hay out of them 
than he did out of 8 or 10 in the old days. "We get a lot o' 
hay 
with them four men. I don't see how we can mechanize any further 
than we are, right now." 
Plants some corn and soybeans to feed the birds on his 
gunning preserve. "I kiddingly say I farm for the birds." Doesn't 
do any commercial farming apart from salt hay harvesting. 
(animal), 
(plant). 
Always loved hunting. Remembers how in high school, whenever 
he wrote reports about "what you wanted to do 
in your life," he 
always wrote about salt haying, about playing pro baseball, & 
about having a gunning preserve, "and I done all 
three." Played a 
bit of pro ball, but broke his ankle the first year and learned 
that it wasn't the 
life he wanted. Has played a lot of ball with 
Herschel Beebe. "My wife says I should be a happy man. I did all 
three things I wanted and got her, besides, so." occupations, 
recreation. 
Releases pheasants, quail & chuckers on his preserve. 
Normally gunning preserves are not particularly profitable, but 
it works well 
in tandem with his salt hay business. 
Because he's 
religious, he doesn't operate his preserve on Sundays, even 
though license permits him to do so. People urged him to be open 
on Sundays & said he'd never survive if 
he didn't. 
But he stuck 
to his principles & has made money in the gunning preserve 
business every year for 22 years despite not operating on 
Sundays. 
He's seen plenty of other gunning preserves go broke, 
even though they did operate on Sundays. Started his preserve in 
1959-60. Before that he 
lived 
in Port Norris, then sold 1000 
acres to the State for their hunting preserve, & bought the farm 
on Stipson Island Rd. with that money. 
He started his gunning 
preserve right after he moved there. 
Had always wanted to do it. 
Had never seen one, but had read of 
it. 
Main bird he handles is 
pheasant. 
5 min. 
Starting to get more into chucker, a Western bird which 
is 
gray with bright red beak and legs, between quail & pheasant in 
size. He buys them ready raised as he does pheasant. 
They are 
more economical & cost only 1/2 the cost of a pheasant. 
Has farm broken into different areas big enough so that a 
person can hunt in each area for about 3-4 hours without 
retracing. Then he doesn't let anybody into the area until that 
hunter is done hunting. 
Hunters call 
the night before to tell 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel logs 
page 104 
how many birds they want to hunt. 
They buy a minimum of 50 birds 
ahead of time as part of their membership. 
Then they call 
the 
night before & tell 
how many birds they want to have placed out. 
Before the hunter gets there, George goes out & scatters that 
many birds 
in a given area. The hunter then goes out & hunts 
there for 1/2 day or all 
day & it's up to him to find the birds. 
Buys his birds in Annapolis, Md. Lot of breeders in Pa. Has a big 
flight pen 
in his back yard, where he keeps the birds until their 
release. 
7.5 in. 
Years ago, they used to be out in the meadows working at 7 
a.m., now they don't start until around 8, because with automatic 
balers, they have to do 
it after the dew is burned off, so they 
can't actually start baling until 9 a.m. 
Moisture makes the 
bales harder on the machinery. 
Doesn't buy many quail because members don't prefer them as 
much. Down South there are big quail preserves. Here they mainly 
like pheasant & chucker. Has members from all over--some local, 
some from Del., Pa. & N.Y. George can give them "about as natural 
hunting here, 
like hunting out 
in the wild," because he has 
natural boundaries such as Delaware Bay & over 2 miles of salt 
meadows, 
if they get away, they can be hunted again, because they 
don't get on a neighbor's property. 
"And I can give the hunter just about any type o' 
huntin' he 
wants and you learn your members, okay? Some of 
'em really like 
to hunt hard & I can put 'em 
in areas on my farm where they have 
to hunt hard to find a bird and then I used member out of N.Y., 
I'd call him a shooter and he would come down. He wanted to kill 
25 birds each time he come down. I would carry my gun & guide him 
& he would always bring a guest that wasn't that great of a shot. 
The bird would get up & I'd give 'em one shot and then I'd shoot 
it. Why, half the time, they didn't even know I shot it and I'd 
just wait 'til I got behind a tree or somethin' and I'd slip 
in 
another shell and, you know, and they was all tickled to death 
and I had a ball my own self and paid for doin' 
it... So you have 
all 
kinds of members. There's not, most of mine is good hunters, 
themselves. I didn't have very many like that." 
Some hunters come 4 or 5 times a year, others come pretty 
near every week. Never allows more than 50 members, which as much 
as 1500 acres can support. If he took any more, he would defeat 
the purposes, which is to give hunters privacy that they don't 
get in public preserves. 
"They like to come down here & then go 
out there & hunt without havin' another gunner walk across in 
front of 
'em." 
10 min. 
"Oh, up here on the State properties, they pretty near get 
in fights. A bird will get up and 6 people will shoot at it and 
all 
of 'em's claimin' 
it and here the bird gets up and he's your

bird." 
There are thousands of snow geese in area, but his hunters 
aren't interested in them. 
Has excellent duck hunting on his 
land. 
Has duck hunted all 
of his life and loves it, 
but limit of 
one black duck makes 
it not worth it to go out in a boat with a 
rack of decoys, etc. The one black duck limit has drastically cut 
back on duck hunting in area. Snow geese are destructive to 
meadows. 
They're good eating only right after they first come 
down. Later they get fairly rank. 
Had believed they weren't 
very good after they were here a while, but last year he ate a 
few his son had shot without knowing what they were and thought 
they were fine. "My son had killed a couple o' geese and we'd had 
'em for dinner & I's sayin' how excellent they was. My son stood 
there & let me tell this whole story, you know, about snow geese 
wasn't good to eat. 
When I got done he said, 
'Dad, what do you 
think you ate last night?' So, that kind o' 
wiped out all 
o' 
my 
thoughts on it." Snow geese are plentiful between State meadow & 
mouth of the river. 
Snow geese damage the meadow by pulling up 
sedge to eat the roots, "so when they get done, all you got is a 
mud pie." Erosion then washes meadow away, 
in spite of 
its 
flatness. Grass then doesn't grow, and decaying matter for fish 
no 
longer available & then whole system is then altered. 
conservation, (plant), (animal). 
12.5 min. 
Snow geese always have been plentiful down on Egg Island, 
but for years they were generally scarce, and after a period of 
protection, they made a tremendous comeback, so now they are 
plentiful enough to damage the meadows. Has 50 deer on his farm, 
but he doesn't like to shoot them & he doesn't permit them to be 
hunted, either. "Now how you figure the psychology of that, don't 
ask me because I've loved to bird hunt & duck hunt & things all 
my 
life, yet I don't like to shoot a deer, so I don't understand 
it, 
so I don't expect you to and I just love to see the deer, you 
know around the farm." 
Deer know that the gunners will not bother them, & will just 
move out of the way & go around, they don't scare away even by 
all 
the pheasant shooting going on. "When I was young, I used to 
enjoy it, we'd, down 
in the meadows, you'd see the old osprey go 
out and catch fish, you know and then they'd come in, 
the bald 
eagle would come in, take the fish away from the osprey and DDT 
changed all that. 
It pretty near wiped everything out...Oh, yeah, 
the whole meadow's comin' back, 
it has came back to life. It's 
not comin', it's came back to 
life. 
It infuriated me a few years 
ago, they was sayin' I was raisin' 
all 
the mosquitos in the salt 
meadows, and I said, 
'Well, you come in and you wiped out all the 
natural enemies of the mosquito and then you claim I'm raisin' 
'em,' because they wiped out the fiddler crabs. The whole meadow 
was sterile. You know, the fiddler crabs was gone, the mussels 
was gone, the fish in the ditches was gone, the crabs 
in the 
ditches was gone. 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 106 
[15 min.] 
Everything was, you know, they had wiped 
it out, and I was 
pleasantly surprised how quick the meadows has come back since 
they quit using it. The fiddler crabs is back strong now. The 
meadows just came back to 
life again. The dragonflies is back. 
They was completely gone and Mother Nature has kicked back and 
they're all back again and it's good to see 'em." 
"You wipe out everything else and the mosquito he gets used 
to 
it and he's still bitin' you while everything else is dead & 
gone." Life in the meadows has been coming back 
in the last 4 or 
5 years or so. 
"I was glad to see 
it because that's half of the enjoyment 
of working outside is going down 
in the meadow and seein' the 
osprey and the eagle takin' the fish." A few ospreys have come 
back & he thinks he has seen a young eagle off the point, this 
summer. "But I did see a beautiful bald—headed eagle out here 
sailing once this summer and that's the first one I've seen 
in 
years, but you know even the small things like the fiddler crabs 
and things like the dragonflies, you know, you don't think o' 
them kind o' 
things 'til they're gone, that's right, and that's 
when you miss 'em." 
Most people don't enjoy meadow work because of the mosquitos 
and greenheads biting and because it's so dirty and "it's hard, 
physical, manual 
labor." 
17.5 min. 
Because he foresaw death of hay business, he went into 
building business and found that dealing people harder than doing 
manual 
labor. 
Could always sleep well when he worked manually, 
but not so 
in building business. 
Got into the oil drilling 
business indirectly by being interested in catfish for his ponds. 
Went out to western Kentucky (Diamond Lake near Owensboro) to 
look 
into catfish to stock his ponds. While there, he met a man 
in the oil 
drilling business & then got into 
it. People in this 
area don't accept catfish as food. Spent weeks on the rigs 
learning the oil drilling business.

of his life & has never held another job. 
He lives 
outside of Mauricetown, going towards Millville on Buckshutem Rd. 
John 
is a "proger," a man who doesn't specialize in any one 
thing, but pursues a number of different things such as trapping, 
hauling seines, oystering, etc. 
Linwood Veach, Sr. 
is now a State conservation officer, but 
he & his family eel 
out of George's creek. 
They also crab. 
Mostly they eel for the "fresh market." 
A live truck comes 
through periodically & buys the eels. 
They are also salted down

& sold to Chesapeake for crab bait for use on trotlines. When 
George was a boy, they used to "trout line" [local pronunciation 
of trotlinel 
in Delaware Bay, hasn't been done in 35 years. Now 
they just pot. There's quite a bit of trapping in area. 
Just had 
a call from a trapper today, who wanted permission to trap on his 
meadows. Trapping in area is for 'coon & muskrat, but mostly 
muskrat. Salem has big auction for muskrat fur. 
Up in Salem Co., 
they maintain & work their meadows for muskrat the way he does 
for salt hay. 
They are banked & have their water level 
controlled to maintain prime muskrat habitat. 
22.5 min. 
Practices salt haying through February. Sometimes if 
it gets 
cold enough to freeze the salt meadows, they can drive machinery 
through areas that are usually too soft to cut hay at other 
times. Can only be done during a very hard freeze, because a 
heavy crop also insulates the bottom from freezing. Every year, 
you have about one week that you can do this. The "tidal meadows" 
can only be cut during this "hard freeze" period. Generally is 
in 
February. George's sons work for him, and he hires two local 
boys. 
There's not enough work to keep them busy all 
year, 
because of dead period from February to June. 
25 min. 
He can keep one of his boys busy 
in February & March working 
on the gunning preserve, picking & releasing pheasants. In 
spring, he's banking & getting meadows ready for summer, so 
there's year round work for him, at least. Gunning preserve is 
run from 1 November through 15 March. License permits it to be 
run from 1 September, but mosquitos are too bad before first 
frost, that it's not worth it to hunt until there has been a few 
good frosts. Had several good frosts this week, the first ones of 
the year. George's brother is 
in Anchorage, Alaska. His son went 
up there after high school graduation and worked.

His nephew & brother are building investors in Anchorage, 
Alaska. If the boy had stayed home in South Jersey, he'd be a 
factory worker. 
In Alaska he's a very successful businessman. 
George has experimented with cooking & eating horseshoe 
crabs. Evidently has "some decent meat" 
in 
it. 
"I took 'em & 
they got decent meat in 
'em 2 places & so I put a couple & 
steamed 'em to try and 
if 
you didn't know it, they taste just 
like any other crab. Okay, you know that back flap? Okay, 
if you 
cut that back flap off & then cut that sharp tail 
off & steam it 
good, then the right down next to the ridge bone, there's 2 
pieces of meat in there, just about as big as your thumb. Yeah, 
so 
it's like, 
it's accordin' the size o' 
the crab, but the good, 
big female is that large and it's 
like 
lump crab meat and my 
daughter's fussy so I did some of 
it and then there's 2 strips up 
in the main shell, but the main shell 
is so hard to get to, 
it 
isn't worth it, 
but that back flap isn't that bad. You can just 
take a hatchet & knock that off real quick & then you only got a 
small portion that you're steamin', okay?... The whole horseshoe 
crab, okay?, the big round thing, went back there's a separate 
section on a hinge, 
like, that separate section, just in front of 
the long spike of the tail. So I'd cleaned some of 
'em up and I 
had my wife saute it, was sittin' here on the counter. 
My 
daughter came down & was eatin' some. I says, 
'You like that, 
Shel?,' & she says, 
'Yeah, 
'at's good!,' & then I told her what 
it was & she wouldn't eat no more, but before she found out what 
it was, you know, 
it tastes as good as any other crab & they're 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel logs 
page 109 
out here in this bay b' 
the millions, so thick, they wasn't, I'd 
say there was only a third as many this year. Now what happened, 
I don't know, but last year they was so thick that they had me 
really worried because they was comin' 
in & literally tearin' the 
creek out, down here, and my banks on my meadow. 
See, they come 
up 
in the creek and they just stand there & crawl to 
lay their 
eggs & they eat up under the bank & then the bank caves in & in 
places, down here the creek is twice as wide as 
it was from the 
king crabs & they was comin' 
in on my bay shore & comin' up & 
just clawin' my banks right away, but this year, that's the way 
Mother Nature generally takes care of a oversupply that way. I'd 
say only there was only about a third as many. But see, they used 
to get 'em & use 'em for fertilizer, but there is some good meat 
in them things if somebody ever, you know, decided, but they're 
known as, what a relation to the scorpion or some, yeah, so I 
don't know whether anybody would want to make a, 
you know, how 
the publicity could be handled to say that they's good, but I've 
eaten 'em and they tasted excellent." 
(foodways), (animal). 
2 5 min 
"I experimented with 'em & cut 'em open & dissected 'em & 
that back flap is very easy to get to 
'cause I just knock 
it, 
well, what I did, I have a radial saw out here and you could just 
zip 
it off & then I steamed 'em & then when you steam 'em, they 
become rubbery like. Well, 
if you have a big butcher knife, you 
just take it & split it 
in half in that section & then you just 
have a smaller & it just falls right out. You can do 
it 
in 
seconds... Yeah, it's not a, 
it's a whole tot easier to get out 
than a regular crab, by far... So 
it's relatively easy. It's easy 
to get to." 
George disagrees with the spraying of gypsy moths, believing 
that it's better to 
let nature balance them out. Remembers a few 
years ago army worms decimated marshes so they looked like a fire 
had gone through them. They couldn't afford to spray them. 
They 
were there 2 years & haven't been seen since. He believes that 
they got a disease & wiped themselves out & he thinks the gypsy 
moths would have done that, but spraying keeps them back so that 
they can keep increasing & doing more damage. "You know, this is 
my own farmer theory." Generally opposes chemical spraying. 
conservation, 
insects, belief. 
5 min. 
Last year, horseshoe crabs were in the millions. This year 
there are only about 1/3 as many. 
In bay mostly weakfish and 
bunker (menhaden) are netted. Bunker now used for crab bait, as 
the menhaden plants have been closed. "But they [menhaden] 
in 
these creeks every year so thick that just burn the oxygen out, 
you know, the real small ones, and have big fish kills." Croakers 
are coming back 
in the bay; he finds them occasionally in 
the 
pots. Haven't been seen for years. Pots are set for crabs. 
Netting is for weakfish & menhaden. George nets occasionally to 
get menhaden for crab pot bait. "I'm not a real water person like 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel

I'd say Veach is. 
I've just played with it for the crabbin'." He 
grew up 
in Port Norris, but was 17 before he ever entered a 
shucking house, so he went in to see what it was like. fishing. 
7.5 min. 
West Creek 
is the creek that comes down through his 
property. 
"Yeah, well, I had an interesting one now out there one day 
& had a lot of fun. I was a little old for it. 
It was like was 
sort o' 
like a kid. The whole mouth has a bad sand bar, okay?, 
and that's why you don't see more boats 
in 
it 
'cause you gotta 
work the tide all 
the time to go 
in and out. Well, I misjudged it 
& I got out there & got hung up on the bar. Well the tide drops 
out, so 
it's only about ankle high and I was standin' 
in the boat 
& seen this big wake come outa the creek & the next one came out, 
here was this fin was this high out o' 
the water. So the next one 
come, I took my hook that I catch my pot lines with & I got out 
o' 
the boat & I got over & when a wake come up by me, I snagged 
it & they was tide runners, weakfish & them weakfish must've run, 
oh, seven, eight pounds, 
'cause they's large enough so when I put 
'em 
in a bushel basket, the heads was up out o' 
this end, the 
tail was out o' 
this end & I must have caught, I guess 'bout 8 of 
'em, or didn't catch, hooked 'em & I, 
like a kid, I really had a 
ball & it was showed you how boats affect 'em, Veach come down 
the creek & must've been a 'blow out tide,' cause he thought he 
could—a got out, too & when he seen me hung up, 
he turned around, 
but the fish quit runnin' just like that, and after he was gone 
'bout 10 minutes, they started runnin' again, but down here 
in 
one o' 
the reaches a old feller by name of Bill Lee has, he'd 
used to go down here & tong and, aw, them oysters's just 
delicious! Just delicious! And he's the only one that I think 
that knows where that bed is, 
'cause I've never seen anybody else 
in there, tongin'. About onced or twiced a winter, he'd go down 
there & tong a few bushel 
o' 
your oysters & he always stop here & 
drop some off to me and they was, they're really tasty...They 
just grow there." narrative. 
Talks about how good local oysters are compared to some he 
had 
in Hilton Head, S.C. 
10 min. 
Talking about eating raw shellfish & prefering it to cooked. 
Shucked oysters have little flavor because they're "washed to 
death," to conform to state regulations. "You've washed about 
fifty per cent of the taste of of 
'em by the time they come out 
o' 
the shuckin' house." 
lfoodways? 
"Yeah, you know, when I seen the hay business dyin', I 
started lookin' around & wonderin' what I's goin' 
to do & I'd 
looked at different parts, you know, just thinkin'. I haven't 
never seen anywhere that I liked better than what we got right 
here, you know, we really have it all. You have the bay & the

creeks, you know, we just have a lovely area." 
"But sure, you have your seasons out there in the meadow 
like you do on, you know, your upland and the wildlife changes, 
you know, 
'cause in the winter, you don't have your crabs and a 
lot o' 
your fishes & things that either bed down. Why, your 
fiddler crabs go under the mud & everything for the winter but in 
the winter you have your ducks & your geese & things move in 
so 
you just have your different..."

Hunting has to go according to Federal seasons. For ducks & 
migratory birds, you have to go according to Federal regulations.

September, he doesn't until 1 November because of mosquito 
problem. 
government. 
"I 
had a doctor out o' 
New York come down one time at the 
end of October & when he called me, I said, 
'Doc, you don't want 
to come yet, mosquitos hasn't gone.' He said, 
'George,' he said. 
'I've changed my 'pointments around. I wanna come.' I says, 
'Doc. 
Okay, but just remember I told you that you didn't want to come.' 
So anyhow, he come down, we went out across in front o' 
the 
house, here, and I'd say we's out there a half hour. 
We made one 
swing around and hit the road. By the time we hit the road, you 
wouldn't—a believed it. His neck was hangin' over his collar. One 
eye was completely shut. I'd never seen anything like 
it 
in my 
life. Them mosquitos swelled him up 
like a balloon and I guess 
where he come fresh out o' 
the city, you know he 
wasn't used to 
'em & I took him up 
in the apartment where you know we have for 
the gunners. I was rubbin' him down with alcohol, witch hazel & 
he says, 
'I can't believe it. I can't believe it,' 
he said, 
'but 
I'll 
tell you one thing. When you tell me not to come again, I 
won't be here!,' but I've lived here all my 
life & I've never 
seen anybody affected that way. 
He literally just all puffed 
up... Well, I'd say 
if anybody says they're used to 'em, they're 
liars, but you just learn to accept 'em & you just know they're 
there & you just don't think about 'em, I guess. But for this 
little crabbin' thing over here, people associate greenheads & 
things with crabbin', so they don't bother 'em. You know they 
bite 'em, but they accept it. 
It's what you know that you're 
gonna have to do, I guess." 
15 min. 
"I've had a lot of wonderful days duck hunting, I guess & 
I've seen some horses get so stuck 
in the mire bay that scared me 
when I was a kid you know, I've seen them go down so that just 
about the only thing that was showin' was their head. Yeah, and 
they, you know we've just had to put ropes around their necks and 
things and just we would drag 'em out, and you know being young, 
we remember those types o' 
things." "I just love the meadows." 
Has names for some of the marshes. 
Calls marsh near Port 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel

page 112 
Norris, the Cabin Marsh, because his dad once had a cabin there, 
when he used to "scow up" hay so he could live there a week at a 
time, & would only come home weekends. Other meadows just called 
by names of the people who owned them. 
His own meadows, he calls 
after the people he bought. 
One he bought from Alvin Hand, he 
calls the Hand Meadow. The one near Heislerville which belongs to 
the State, he calls the Heislerville Trac'. Over in Port Norris, 
was one called the Owl's Nest & Turkey Point. They are gone, now. 
Used to belong to Glen "Diggs" Robbins of Newport. Jiggs had 
heart trouble & couldn't keep up with shoring them up, 
so they 
vanished, "and I was amazed how quick they reverted." Ezra Cox 
lost about 500 acres right across West Creek because he wasn't 
able to maintain its banks, "...and I can see the time comin' 
that I'm losin' mine also, but I'm just fightin' 
longer, I 
guess... The tides break the banks and the tides just keep comin' 
in & then 
it changes the whole vegetation structure and you lose 
all 
your salt hay,. That's right." It turns into unmarketable 
stuff & gets so soft & wet that you can't get out there with 
machinery. 
naming, technology, (plant). 
17.5 min. 
When George was about 8, his dad got his first F12 small 
tractor, then got little Farmall "A"'s & little Fergusons. Didn't 
have automatic balers until the 1950s. All the first automatic 
balers were too big & heavy so "if you took 'em out in 
the 
meadow, you'd lose 'em." 
Hay left to cure for a couple of days 
in summer. Once frost 
kills it, 
it doesn't have to be cured, but can be directly baled 
after cutting, then you can hay wet meadows, by raising up the 
blade & cutting it so that it doesn't fall 
in the water, but lie 
in the stubble instead. Baler is set up a little bit to pick 
it 
clean off the stubble, "...and you can bail some decent hay when 
your tractor is actually runnin' 
in a little bit o' water." 
When the ground 
is frozen is the best time, because you 
don't have to worry about holes so you just "make a straight 
shot." 
20 min. 
Holes can be a problem if 
you don't know the meadow, "but 
when you've worked in 
it as 
long as I have, you just learn 
it & 
you know your meadow & you know places that you don't go." When 
he was in Kentucky he left his boys 
in charge of haying, they 
went down 
in Cabin Marsh "& they seen a big piece o' 
marsh that I 
hadn't cut & they said, 
'I wonder why Dad hadn't cut this,' 
you 
know. Well, I got a phone call. They had all 3 of my tractors 
down. They shouldn't've been out there & it was strictly, you 
know, they didn't realize that that piece was that soft until 
they got out & got into 
it & only way they got out, the Mosquito 
Commission come down with one o' 
their rigs with a big winch on 
it & winched them out, but they was boys that growed up 
in 
the 
meadow some and that shows you, you gotta know where you're goin' 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel logs 
page 113 
out there." George knows which areas in a given meadow you can 
hay & which ones you can't. Has an area in the nearby marsh that 
he's only been able to hay twice in 22 years because it's "rotten 
marsh." "A 
lot of marsh, you'll go over & it will wave, 
like, 
okay?, but then there's some marsh you don't wave, you just go 
'poonk!,' and that's what we call 
'rotten marsh,' and you just 
think it just breaks right through. It's interesting, you're 
workin' cranes or heavy machinery out there, you can be standin' 
a hundred yards off and feel the meadow vibrating. Well, you're 
workin' on mud & it don't have the stability that your upland 
does." With heavy equipment you have much bigger rubber & you 
have flotation devices, that knowledge of meadows is not as 
critical as it used to be & with 4 wheel drive, 
it's "just like 
havin' 2 tractors in one." 
"I 
remember back when we had horses, we had the of mud 
shoes you put on 'em, you know, and you'd go down there, hookin' 
them things on they'd hit you & their tail you know full o' mud, 
aw! I would never want to go back to that." history, (animal). 
22.5 min. 
Loading the boxcars, only way to get hay up was to 
lift it. 
Remembers being soaked 
in sweat after loading hay, "and I can 
remember an old fellow that worked for us, we got 
in the truck. 
We was all wet & you couldn't put the windows down 'cause you'd 
get cold, you know, where it's so wet & I'd say 
it got a little 
odor & the old fellow worked for us 
it was about Wednesday & he 
says,'Phew!,' he says, 
'I 
took a bath Sa'd'y and,' he says,'I 
stink already!,' and I thought, you know & here we'd been doin' 
this for 3 days! So can you imagine bein' 
in that truck with 
him?" Had lot of good men back 
in those days. Hard to find men to 
work that hard today. 
"And there was a knack to pitchin' hay. You put a greenhorn 
up on a wagonload o' 
hay & he'd kill hisself tryin' to pitch the 
hay out from under his feet, you know & pullin' 
it from the wrong 
place & like any other profession, you learn how to hit the hay 
with a fork & you could tell how the hay 
is 
layin' & you'd know 
where to pick the hay up and 
like any other thing, you know, 
there's a knack to handling the bales & handling the pitchfork & 
you know the whole thing." technology. 
Always enjoyed watching a real professional work. When he 
was 
in housing business, was putting on a roof & then a real 
roofer came up & he saw that he was wasting his time. 
labor. 
25 min. 
"What I'm tryin' down on this bay front now & what made me 
start it was last year where the king crabs was so horrible. I'm 
goin' out there on me outside & stackin' up tires, car tires, & 
then drivin' stakes through 'em & then tyin' them all 
together 
with plastic twine for two things -- one, so the crabs can't eat 
it away & then the other if the water goes over, 
it'll have 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel

something to fall over instead of just washing, but it's a lot o' 
work. It's a lot o' 
work." 
There's as much work in maintaining the banks as there is 
in 
cutting. 
Because of the salt's corrosiveness, there is a 
tremendous amount of equipment maintenance involved. 
Everything 
keeps rusting all 
the time. 
"I was goin' across the large long bridge one day with my 
crane & she broke right in the middle & I just pulled back on the 
stick & prayed & she went right on up & when she fell, 
lunged on 
the other side, I stopped & my 
legs was just jumpin' up & down so 
much from nerves, you know I couldn't control 
'em, 
'cause 
if that 
thing had pitched one way or the other, I would—a still been 
in 
that creek and that was very, you don't forget that too often. 
Whew! That was a scare!...Yeah, that's part of the business."

Charlie "growed up all 
over," because 
his father moved around. Was born 
in Groveville, near Trenton. 
Coming into Groveville, you always go downhill. "Now whatever way 
that you go into Groveville, from Yardville in, 
you go uphill. 
See, you go down a hill 
to get into Yardville, and you come up a 
hill 
to get into Gro... When you come 
in from Bordentown the old 
road, you go downhill, down into Gro... I said I was born 
in a 
hole and never got out of 
it." His father came down to Belleplain 
area to start a sawmill, and Charlie followed behind. Can just 
barely remember the move. family history. 
"But you can't do that today what me daddy and my mom done 
over there at that mill, that they got the room built over here 
what's called Port, ah, Muskie Switch. On there was there two 
sawmills. See that's where me daddy come down and got a job and 
went to work. They took and sawed the lumber. Next day they built 
the house. Next time, the house was done, we then, we 
laid right 
right in the bed and looked out, and s.., and like right out

nights, 
'til 
we got straightened out and Mom made our beds in the 
horse stables, right below what they call Lauder's Mill, here by 
Port Elizabeth Road and Pop had our furniture shipped down from

Well, there you are, see. I didn't get in there, maybe 2 or 3

cranberries, when they were done by hand. Got 5c. per peck for 
picking them. "And that five cents was that big, them days." Five 
cents then bought more than $10 today. Also worked blueberry

Never made any charcoal, but he knows 
how to make it, but he wouldn't. Now you have to have a permit 
from the State, just to have the right to burn. How to make it 
described: 
Start out building a tripod of timber standing up. 
About seven cords is the biggest you can put up at a time. 
It is 
then covered with turf, and solidified in a "float shanty" with 
pine blocks, using roots to hold it together. Then you put sand 
around it, 
and another layer of slabs. If you don't reinforce it 
with slabs and sand, then 
if you up on the top to smother it, 
when it's burning too fast, you can fall 
in and burn to death. 
One man did, because he didn't make top thick enough to hold his 
weight. Has to have thick layers of sand and turf. His 
grandfather, father, and uncle used to "put up" charcoal, and he 
watched them. A lot of that charcoal used for refining silver. 
Without charcoal, silver would be 
like lead, and 
it would not 
ring. technology.

like most people would. 
Most 
people go around and around in a circle, when they're lost. 
He 
could be put out in the woods blindfolded in the dark, and he'd 
find his way out. His method is to find direction by noticing 
which side of the trees that has the longest, heaviest limbs on 
it, which will be north side. cognitive maps. 
Brags about how good he 
is at finding directions. 
Even 
though he cannot read or write, he was able to drive delivery 
truck for Hundred Prairies Foundry, he made deliveries all 
through New York and Connecticut. People would stop him and ask 
for directions, and he would have them follow him until they were 
on the right trail. He studied road maps, despite his illiteracy. 
When he 
lived at Mrs. Deason's in Tuckahoe, he worked at 
Mason's then. Old man Keane wanted him to take him to Hazelton, 
Pennsylvania. He took him and brought him back although he didn't 
know where Hazelton was. He studied the route numbers on the map. 
When he got there, he pulled into a gas station, and asked where 
the house he was looking for was, and 
it was right by there.

a pile of junk 
in a barnyard in Pennsylvania, and asked to buy 
it,

idea what a junk man was, but was

Farmer invited him

farmer gave him the junk and showed him other places in valleys 
nearby where junk was dumped, because they didn't know what a 
junk man was. Farmer showed him junk in the shed. Then he 
loaded 
up, and when he got to the state line, he was stopped, and 
weighed and had 11 
or 12 tons, although he was licensed for 13 
tons, so they weren't able to arrest him, because truck had extra

Talks about how he 
learned to keep his mouth shut. 
His 
brother, Johnny, had gotten drunk 
in one of the shanties by the 
sawmill, and gotten into a fight and Charlie had told on him, and 
his mother threatened to 
lick him if he didn't keep his mouth 
shut. 
Johnny had promised to give him a nickel or to get him 
candy from the store, 
if he would tell him when there was a 
fight. 
Nowadays, no matter how much you make, Uncle Sam takes it 
before you even get paid, whether you have food on your table or 
not. "They want their cut, first." 
He 
lived 
in Philadelphia for a while. He worked in a place 
in Chinatown. 
They had street tax, water tax, wage tax, sidewalk 
tax, besides rent and electricity. It was all 
taken out of your 
pay before payday. That was one reason why he 
left Philadelphia 
and came back to New Jersey. 
One night in Philadelphia, he got out of a trolley car and a 
"colored girl 
and a white girl" pulled a knife on him and robbed 
him. After that, he told his boss that he was quitting after the 
next payday. "That was my 
last look at a butcher knife." "Well, 
you're life ain't valued nothin' 
in Philadelphia." He had lived 
on Spruce St. for about 2 or 3 years.

"Well. I've deer hunted. Mount Holly Jail's my new home. Oh,

Grady had a place right there by the Four Mile Circle, uh, 
the 
Red Lion Circle, you go up to 206. Drove by, they had me in 
there, the deputy, and that was when you had to produce a deer, 
too, you know, for evidence. Friend of mine from Tabernacle, he 
come by. He knew pretty near what was goin' on. He said to his 
wife, he said, 
'I 
believe they got Charlie with a deer,' you 
know. He backed up there and turned around and come back and got 
the deer out o' 
my car and took it. This deputy game warden was 
little old Gibbsey and he said the, he said, 
'There hain't no 
deer in Charlie's car,' he said. So, all 
they got me for, then, 
the judge, see I paid me fine right then, see, when I found out 
the deer was gone, was buckshot and illegal huntin' and carryin' 
a firearm. I paid me fine. So after the game warden left and this 
judge said to me, he said, 
'Charlie, don't forget me,' 
he said. 
'I 
ain't gonna tell.' He said, 
'What in the name o' God you 
suppose got that deer?' I said, "I don't know,' I said, 
'I 
had 
it

'cause I had a Model B Ford, you know with a, 
you could open a lid and 
it pulled up and make a rumble seat on a

Jim Beebe and Ethel, they 
knowed pretty near, he just opened the 
lid up and whipped me out 
o' 
the deer, he grabbed it out and throwed it 
in his car and took 
off. He told me afterwards. Yeah, ya hadda produce a deer, then." 
law enforcement. 
Nowadays you don't have to produce a deer for evidence. "If 
they catch you now, they've got you." Nowadays one cop doesn't 
have to come after you, because they can radio for help and have 
people waiting for you to come out either way. They can block all 
access roads to where you are, so that you drive right up to 
them. Poaching just no 
longer worth it, 
today. If you can't pay 
the fine, they can seize your car or house. "The State is hungry. 
They're poor, they."

Worked at a place called Old Quaker, by Friendship, he 
killed a man delivering from New York. What they did with him, he 
doesn't know. There's 12 or 14 of them go out of there every week 
or two, he'd take them to New York, and he was supposed to be a 
game warden, and Charlie was supposed to be his deputy. Something 
fouled up and the other guy wouldn't take the job. Now he's dead. 
It's a job Charlie wouldn't want, no matter how much money, 
because he has too many friends. He wouldn't want to be game 
warden. Deer come by eating stuff and then they disappear. 
When 
Charlie lived up by Hunter's Mill, he had a gun with a silencer. 
That's how deer disappear. Deer afraid of Charlie's truck or car. 
If they see it, 
they know what's coming.

Charlie Pomlear is Herschell Beebe's uncle. Charlie raised 
Herschell over at Hunter's Mill, and Herschell's father sold 
deer. Herschell grew up at Hunter's Mill, when it was 40 miles 
from nowhere. Herschell hunts deer with bow and arrow. He was 
stationed near Chatsworth for a while, but he did not stay there 
for long, and they sent him down to this area. He'll be ready to 
retire, soon. To go deer jackin' you take a spotlight and go 
shoot them. Some hunt them in the daytime, too.

Some poachers now use dogs."That's a poor thing, now, with 
dogs." Can hear by the sound of the dog, what he 
is running. They 
used to have fox hounds up on the farm and they went fox hunting, 
but they ran deer, too. Has done some 'coon hunting. 
(animal) 
"One time, I was up a tree and 'bout ready to haul off, you 
know?, with a stick, I had a stick about that long to knock a 
'coon and the goddamn safety belt broke and, boy, a good thing I 
was over a patch of briars. Man. I was tore from one end down 
'neath the other. I come down 'bout thirty feet or better, right 
down them thick bull briars and stuff. Now that part o' 
my way to 
get into the tree, why to get up 
it with creepers on and I wound 
that job up. Any more tree climbin', somebody else done it. I 
said, 
'There she is. You wanna go up there? Go. I'm done.'" 
Never raised hunting dogs. Always bought his dogs from 
different kennels. Some of the dogs he bought, he never saw again 
after they got loose. People used to steal dogs from him. One 
thief took a dog right off his chain. "If I'd 
'a' 
been there and 
seen 'im, 
I'd 
'a' 
shot 'im. 
I'd 'a' 
killed 'im just as sure as 
God made apples." He came back from Mount Holly and his dog was 
stolen. 
Never fished. Doesn't like fish. "They stink. About one mess 
o' 
fish a year is enough for me."

it's all 
dried up, but once his brother caught gigantic pike 
there. Harris' Station (between Chatsworth and New Gretna) was 
once a city situated around an old paper mill. Ruins are still 
there. There's a pond there now, near place called G—Harrisville; 
15GT. Mill burned down because the belt on the fire pump hadn't 
been fixed, so when a fire started, 
it couldn't be put out. Mill 
was hydraulically powered.

May's Landing was supposedly started by Indian named May. 
His great grandmother on his mother's side was a "full blooded 
Indian squaw." Had a gas station by the Tuckahoe Bank, but it's 
torn down. Mount Holly 
supposedly was named after an Indian 
chief, and 
it used to be called Bridgetown. 
When he was young, he cut a lot of cedar and pine, and cut a 
lot of snow fence, which they put along highways to control 
drifting. Also cut a lot of "blueberry flats" for berry crates. 
Now crates are all pasteboard or plastic. "Flats" were made of 
cedar. wood. 
Talks about a sawyer who lost three fingers cutting "flats" 
because he wasn't watching what he was doing. 
Charlie also 
damaged a finger, but it stayed intact after swelling 
grotesquely.

Shows me a tool for attaching soles to shoes that he picked 
up at the dump. 
Also has three old fashioned flatirons of the 
kind that you have to heat on a stove. Once found a small 
flatiron in a stump, while he was cutting the stump with a chain 
saw. gathering (scavenging). 
First chain saws he saw were over in Steelmantown, when he 
was working there near the Paupers' Cemetery. 
"Now wait a minute! See, now, I like to know..., see my 
daddy, we lived way up on the farm where I'm talkin' about we 
worked on a farm. I like to know where my daddy was in his 
vision, his dream, or wherever he was. See? Pop said to me, he 
said, 
'Charlie,' now I was settin' at the breakfast table, you 
know. He said, 
'I was in a place,' he said, 
'last night,' he 
said, 
'I 
seen what's comin' to hand.' I said, 
'What's that, Pop?' 
He said, 
'I seen a man was cuttin' down a tree wid a chain.' "Aw, 
you know, now, Pop, you gotta goddamn get ready for New Lisbon.' 
You know what I mean? So, went on talkin', he said, 'Airplanes, 
well, they'll be a—goin' wid no propeller.' I said, well then, 
you know, I said, 
'Well. Pop. My God! You really are goin' 
off 
your rocker.' You know what I mean. I was talkin' to meself. I 
know I daresn't say anything. So, he told about the boat trailers 
and that stuff. So after breakfast, we started back up to get our 
horse and stuff. I said, 
'Pop. Let me ask you a question,' you 
know. He said, 
'What's that, Charlie?' I said, 'Pop, you know, we 
take a chain after we get up, you know, we take and pull and we 
take a chain and me horse or a team and move heavy stuff.' I 
said, 
'How in the hell 
do you expect a man to cut down a tree wid 
a chain?' You know what he done? He boxed my ears and kicked me 
in the ass. You know what I mean? He said, 
'You dumb son of a 
bitch, I learnt you to work with this axe, but,' he said, 
'If you 
don't know how to work one o' 
them chain saws that I seen, you 
see, you're a dumb, you're a name of muck. You ain't gonna get to 
first base wid an axe, well, 
if you don't learn to pick it up.' 
Then one time, I's right up here to Hunter's Mill. I went out to 
bought two brand new chain saws, brand spitter new! Over at Elton 
Burke's over here at Weymouth. I's sittin' there. One pile o' 
logs had sawed. 
'Bout half asleep, pretty near you know, just 
about ready, and he come up and grabbed me from the back. 
'Aw,' I 
said, 
'Jesus Christ, Pop. Don't you ever do that again,' I said, 
'Because I, with the training I took at Fort Dix, I could've went 
between your legs and broke you half in two.' And that's the only 
time that Pop ever learnt, ever bought me a six pack o' 
beer. And 
all 
the time I knowed my daddy, I only seen my daddy drunk, once. 
And he give me hell for drinkin', too but that's the only time 
he, that he ever bought me a six pack o' 
beer. He must 'a' 
stopped at Tucker Inn, see, 
it used to be called Tucker Inn down 
here on the highway. Because it was cold, you know what I mean? I 
said, 
'But, Jesus Christ,' I said, 
'Pop. Don't never, don't ever 
sneak up onto me, grab me 
like that again.' He said, 
'Charlie, I 
didn't think. So,' he said, 
'Well,' 
he said,

"We got there talkin', he said, 'Charlie. Start that thing

he said, 
'I wanna see 'er. See how you got 'er.' Pop said,

'That thing ain't a—

'Whadyou mean, Pop?, I said, 
'She's 
cuttin' all right for me.' 
'Charlie,' he said. 'She's not right. 
You ain't filin' that chain right.' And I know my daddy never 
filed one 
'til 
he filed that chain saw and I had did 
it this way, 
goddamn, I had to go this way with 
it so she went right on to 
it, 
it set you up and I can still make 'em cut pretty good, but I 
can't make it

No sir, she wanted to get right in there. Them shavin' pieces

No, I 
can make 'em work pretty easy, but I don't know, Pop was all 
right, but I'd like to know where he was at in, when he told me, 
when we lived there on that farm and I thought he was goin' off 
his rocker, you know what I mean? Now how in the hell was a man 
gonna go through the air without a propeller? He said, 
'You'll 
live to see 'em.' 
he said, 
'If you live long enough,' he said. 
'Maybe I'll see a few of 
'em, maybe I won't,' but he said, 
'It'd 
be a hell 
of a sight fresher'n that man with that airplane 
without propellers.' We got 'em. They're jets." 
J.L.: "That's right. Yeah, that's what I thought of, too. So did 
he 
live to see 'em?" 
C.P.: "Yeah, 
in the beginnin's of 
'em, yeah. Daddy, he said to 
me, he said, 
'Charlie, you see 
'em, don't you?' I said, 
'Yeah, 
Pop, I've seen 'em.' 
'I was tellin' you the truth, wasn't I?' I 
said, 
'Yeah, Pop, but that's a different kind of a chain what 
we're usin' today to cut down a tree,' I says, 
'From what we's 
draggin' 
logs 
and stuff like that with.' He said, 
'Well,' he 
said, 
'It was a chain, ain't it?' Yeah, yeah." 
J.L.: "Wonder how he knew that." 
C.P.: "That was 
in his vision, for him to see, you know what I 
mean? It was somethin' that where he was at. 
'Cause he tol' me, 
you know, and was at the breakfast table, and I thought to 
myself, 
'My God, Pop, you're goin' off your rockers.' And then 
when he come 
in with a jet plane, you know what I mean?, it'd be 
goin' faster 'n what an airplane, but he didn't know the name of 
it, 
but he said, 
'You'll see 'em,' 
he said. 
'They'll be a lot 
faster than the airplanes,' said, 
'They'd be an airplane, but,' 
he said, 
'I don't know what kind, but,' he said,

Father also farmed. Grandparents had cows, chickens, and 
pigs. On the farm where he and his dad worked, they had over 300 
pigs. State made them kill the pigs to make meat supply scarce. 
Charlie shot them all with a rifle. The inspector wouldn't let 
them keep any of them, because he claimed that they had cholera. 
So they had to bury all 
of them. After dark, he went back and dug 
up some of them. "Now where'd them good clean fed pigs get the 
cholery from? I don't know. He was a liar!" personal history

Raised hogs up 
in G—Chatsworth; 27GT, but not down here, 
because nowadays health inspectors make it 
impossible. Can't even 
raise chickens, because of them. "Hey, you, sometimes you're over

(animal), development. 
Has logged & worked 
in sawmills for most of his life. 
Sawmills today unlike those in the past. 
In old days were run 
with steam engines & were bigger, because timber was much bigger. 
"That's when we needed the chain saws, that's what I told George. 
Goddamit, I seen timber like that. You know what I mean? That's 
what you need your chain s..., not cuttin' these goddamn bean 
poles. Gosh, what we're cuttin' today is nothing but practically 
but bean poles, with a chain saw." 
When they come 
in with chain 
saws today, maple smothers out new growth, and deer clean 
it out, 
too. Never hunted small game, only bigger stuff.

because the game wardens can block you from all four corners when 
you come out of the woods. Rich poachers get away with 
it. 
Herschel Beebe recently caught some from Hunter's Mill, but they 
settled out of court. Pomlear believes that they were canning 
deer meat. "Give him the works, same as they do a poor man. A man 
wants a meat what his table? Give him the same goddamn 
consequences. Just 'cause he got a few dollars, he can get out of 
it, 
and he was slaughterin' the deer. I knew it. I lived right up 
there by Hunter's Mill, I was cuttin' the timber off, I could 
hear 'em a—gunnin'." Mill was supposedly canning cranberry sauce, 
but he believes they were canning deer meat.

Found steel piece at the dump that he uses as a 
backscratcher. Recently injured his back rebuilding a chimney for 
someone. Will never do that again. Shows me an odd piece of 
carved wood he found in the dump, but can't identify. Looks like 
various alligator heads. Many unusual things found 
in the dump. 
gathering (scavenging) 
Worked for Kingston Trap Rock on the grounds of Fort Dix, so 
he wasn't drafted. Did cement work, brick work, & truck driving 
there. 
If you didn't know how to do the work, they would send a 
man to show you how.

Does no more hunting. Doesn't even have a gun. 
Getting too 
old. Will be 70 next birthday. "I was born 
in a hole and never 
got out of her. I been 
in a hole all 
o' 
my life." Describes 
location of Groveville, 
in Mercer Co., near Trenton. Father 
worked for Marshall Co.'s cotton mill, there. His oldest sister 
was burned to death, when she poured kerosene into a coal burning 
cook stove. 
Regarding inquiry about definition of a Piney: "Well, that's 
what we are! Well, 
'cause we follow the woodlands all 
the way 
through. That's what I am, really when you come right down to 
it, 
I'm a Piney, a 'Pioneer's' what we call 
it. Yeah. I come all 
the 
way down 
from Chatsworth down. That was our line o' 
work, you 
see what I mean? Yeah I've cut pulpwood and logs, cedar and 
everything else, sawmill work. I worked here for Mason's. I was a 
foreman here for Mason's Basket Mill, over their sawmill. Dumb as 
I am, but I run 'em. Turned out me remembered stuff."

Tells tale of how, while working for Mason's sawmill, a big 
log saw (which he describes) hit a piece of barbed wire in the 
log, 
and shot several sawteeth into his chest, knocking him down 
backwards. Two of the Puerto Ricans sawed off the piece with a 
crosscut and Charlie split it with an axe and found the piece of 
barbed wire.

Used to be a big glass factory at Head of the River, near 
the church. At Speedwell between Chatsworth and New Gretna there 
used to be a glass furnace, too. Also one at Old Mountain 
Furnace, near Harrisville. They were all 
gone before Charlie was 
old enough to work. 
Used to be a pool 
room nearby in Belleplain, when he was a 
kid, but people in his family didn't patronize it. Had "shindigs" 
there. "All my daddy knowed's work. The more you do, the more he 
put on you to work. Well, that's all 
he knew." 
500 
Used to be 
iron foundry in Hunter's Mill. 
Right name of 
Hunter's Mill 
is Smithville. Once when he caught someone stealing 
wood by a gunning club at Hunter's Mill, they had land surveyed 
and surveyor told them that according to the map, the area was 
called Smithville. George Brewer's four sided plane (molder— 
matcher) came from Smithville. Before Charlie's day, the 
Smithville foundry used to mine iron by Tuckahoe River. Once, 
when gunning there, he found 
4-1/2 tons of 
iron ingots there. 
Describes how he salvaged it by breaking it up with a 30—lb. 
sledgehammer. Describes how he found the ingot and how heavy the 
broken pieces were and how big they were. 
Doubts that they could 
ever have been moved by manpower alone. 
naming.

Has heard of mining of cedar logs occurring in area. 
Knows 
one place where, on state land there are still 
large cedar logs 
in the ground. Old bog cedar shingles called "mud shingles." 
When he worked for Durell, they cleaned out a main creek near the 
remains of the iron foundry and found large buried cedar. 
"I 
could show you cedar trees in there that you and I, 
if they were 
standing, couldn't reach around them, three or four of us." 
Clearing that creek ruined local cranberry bogs and killed off 
pike. Durell Company owned by an old widow, Lil Durell. Charlie's 
father had worked for old man Durell, himself. Used to be very 
large pike there. 
(animal), (plant), conservation, wood. 
Remembers some of the old people singing, but he never 
learned any songs. Pomlear family not musical. Some of the 
families married into the clan are musical, but not the Pomlears. 
"We're just a bunch o' 
dumb Indians." 
Teases me about breaking my camera if I try to take his 
picture. "That's what keeps me alive, 
if I couldn't 'devil.' And 
if I give 
it up, you know how long I'd last? I wouldn't last six 
months or a year." 
Talks about how he wants his remains disposed. "If they had 
me down there here 
in this cedar swamp, I said, 
'Just take that 
bone they're draggin' and dig a little mudhole,' I said, 'and put 
me 
in there and push 
it over and forget about me. I won't know

Likes George Brewer. Tells tale about the time some Puerto 
Ricans stole a big logging truck from George, a few years ago, at 
the mill, and George and Leroy caught them. Leroy had two fingers 
broken in the fight. George lost a few teeth.

[Most of the rest of the tape

Has been an active mushroom gatherer. Has to get "regular 
mushrooms" off a white oak stump. Can't be from black oak or any 
thing else. Otherwise you risk poisoning. "It's easier to get 
sick'n it 
is 
to get well." Knows a fellow from Dorothy who almost 
killed his whole family by gathering the wrong mushrooms. Lost 2 
or 3 kids that way. 
800 
Pomlear's mother used to gather roots to make root beer. 
Doesn't bother because it got cheaper to buy 
it 
in the store 
(when 
it was 5c. a bottle.) If he made to sell, he'd be arrested. 
Complains that today's soda is almost all water. Will find frozen 
cans of soda at the dump and when he cuts them open, they're 
almost all 
ice. Talks about wood stove he has now and oil burner 
it replaced.

G—Delmont; 38GT 
Right now eeling season has ended, so boats and equipment no 
longer in the water. 
Took boats out at Robison's Boat Yard, 
today. Now he's cleaning pots and lines. 
Father (Lynwood E. Veach) was a bayman for years, but not 
grandfather. Grandfather worked at aviation plant in Millville. 
Father learned much on his own and from "old man George Lee." 
Also eeled with John Hays from Heislerville. Lynwood R. fished & 
eeled with his dad and got into it that way. First started 
tending nets with his dad at age 10 or 11. Started eeling on his 
own at age 16. fishing, family history, occupations. 
How eeling done: 
with pots, using king or horseshoe crab 
for bait. Eels also like clam wastes, due to clam houses dumping 
their wastes in the [Maurice] River. Horseshoe crabs available on 
the beach, because they come out to mate in summer during full 
moon. Picked up and put in freezer to save. Trawlers also have 
horseshoe crabs for sale, because they inadvertently pick them up 
in their nets. Pots are ca. 30" 
long x 16" high x 14" wide. 
(animal). 
100 
Most pots are rectangular. Pots have forebay (partition in 
center), with a bait box 
in middle of pot. Has funnel on end to 
admit eel. Wire ends of funnel are jagged, so eels don't go back 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel logs 
page 134 
out. Main difference between crab pot and eel 
pot is size of 
opening 
in funnel. Has to be too small, on an eel 
pot, so a crab 
can't go 
in. Too many small crabs getting into pots can clog them 
up so eels don't enter. Never did 
any 
eel 
spearing, but his 
father did. Eel spearing obsolete. Father still has old eel 
spear. Used to be a lot of eel spearing in area. Lynwood R. 
doesn't care much for eel 
as a food. They salt about 50% of eels 
for sale as salt eel 
bait; other 50% are sold live. Eels usually 
salted in summer, when it's too warm to keep them live. Salted & 
sold down to Maryland for crab bait. When it gets cooler, they 
start to save the bigger eels for the live trade. Kept alive 
in 
live boxes. Will stay alive for a long time, 
if not overcrowded. 
Their live boxes are 6' 
long x 2-1/2' wide x 2' 
high, with an 
opening on top, and screen ends to promote water circulation. 
200 
Has 1-1/2' square opening on top for removing eels. 
A buyer 
from Philadelphia comes down & picks them up 
in a live truck. 
Used to be 2 or 3 buyers 
in 
local area, but not now. Buyers hold 
them in tanks & sort by size. Bigger ones sold at public market 
in York, Pa. Some are frozen, others shipped alive to Europe, 
especially the Netherlands. Some small ones sold to crabbers in 
summer. Eeler gets ca. 65c./Ib. for live eels. Most eels eaten 
in 
area are smoked. The Philadelphia eel buyer goes all 
the way to 
Florida to buy eels. Many bought in North Carolina & Virginia. 
Eels go all the way up the Maurice River to Union Lake. Can't set 
pots there, though. marketing. 
"There was a gentleman up to Dividing Creek used to have a 
duckin' shack out on the meado' and several times he stopped us 
and told us about 'em durin' the night. He said he can hear 'em 
rustlin' through the grass, goin' across the meado' and you take 
a light and see 
'em, 
he says, there's literally thousands of 
'em

Does some commercial fishing for shad and for striped 
[pronounced, "stri—ped"J bass, which he also calls "rock," also 
for white perch, drum, and weakfish. Drum is a large fish, often 
weighing up to 110 lbs. Croaker have not been available in 
Delaware Bay since he was a small boy. Small Cape May goudies 
come up 
into bay. Largest run to 1/2 lb. Used to be a big item 
in 
the Delaware Bay, when they were larger. Cape May goudies also 
called "spots." naming, (animal). 
Shows me pictures of massive Delaware Bay fish kill, 
supposedly caused by spraying by the Mosquito Commission. Too 
much spraying in meadows is then carried out along shore by high 
tides. 
Spray seems to seal the creeks, so that fish cannot get 
any oxygen. 
Most of dead fish 
in photo are small bunkers, 
weakfish, perch, bluefish, each about 2 1/2" 
long. 
Millions

Mosquito Commission believes that they are doing a good job 
controlling them, but there's still just as many mosquitos. In 
the morning, there are huge swarms at the landing, so you can 
hardly stand it. Small muskrat are also killed off by mosquito 
insecticide, because they feed on grass, which is covered with 
the chemical. Also kills young ducks. "It's a bad situation. 
I 
would like to see something done with it, but probably they never 
will." Spraying can kill off next 3 or 4 years' worth of young 
fish. "Miles and miles along the beach, here, 
it's just nothing 
but dead fish." 
Shows me pelts of albino muskrats. They're extremely rare, 
but not nearly as valuable as ordinary muskrats, because the pelt 
then has to be dyed. Also has other pelts, 
including tanned 
muskrat, mink, and otter. Has been trapping since he was a little 
kid. Father was a trapper, too. Went with father as a kid, and he 
showed him how to do 
it. Have to know where to set traps for 
muskrats. 
Have to know signs of their presence, such as where 
they feed and what runs they're using. 
Look for where they've 
stacked the roots on which they feed, their stools. 
Most runs 
they don't use get a white, milky color on the bottom. When 
they're 
in use, they're kept clean, with lots of feed in them. 
Those are the runs where you try to set your traps. Also traps 
raccoon and fox. Shows me two mounted albino muskrats, done by a 
local kid, who was just learning taxidermy. 
500 
Shows me a picture of a duck that they found that had been 
abused by a "sportsman," by having its bill wrapped shut with a 6 
pack holder. Lynwood R. 
does a lot of deer hunting, as does his 
son, Lynwood R., Jr. Mrs. Veach brings in an armload of pelts. 
Talks about Herschel Beebe: "He's caught just about every outlaw 
there 
is around here." Anti—Beebe graffiti discussed: "That's 
mainly the outlaws that he's caught several times." 
Shows me a pumpkin—colored muskrat pelt, called a cross, 
because it's halfway between being an albino and being brown. 
Also worth less than a standard brown one. "Takes years and years 
of generations to get white." Shows me a skunk pelt. Also shows 
me other pelts. His pelts are sold to a fur buyer who comes down 
from Glassboro. Shows me some wild mink furs. The last local mink 
farmer was a Mr. Williams in Leesburg. Minks: "They're awful 
vicious for their size. Awful vicious." Weasel also vicious.

Fishing is by season. 
Starting out in early March, it's 
striped bass, perch, and shad. Last part of May, early June, 
is 
when weakfish and bunker come 
in. 
Bunker main bait fish around

here. Most fish in Delaware Bay caught with gill nets. In order 
to catch different species, you need different depths of nets, 
and also different mesh [pronounced, "mash"]. This year they used 
mainly 3-1/2" mesh to catch bluefish, weakfish, and bunker. If 
you use 3-3/4" mesh, you get too many bunker. So most people stay 
with a 3-1/2" or 3" mesh to get "good fish" & not too many 
bunker. (Hear a flock of geese passing over.) 
About 1st of June, take up fish nets & start eeling. Put out 
pots to catch salt eels for bait trade. This lasts 'til mid— 
September, then they start going for live eels with a bigger mesh 
pot. This lasts 'til 
1st week of November -- second week, "things 
are getting touchy." Too much bad weather then. After that, there 
are high winds almost every day. 
Trapping season begins locally the first of December. Now 
he's getting his pots cleaned up and everything taken care of, 
so 
that he can start trapping when the season opens. Season lasts 
'til 
15 March. You have to tend your traps every 24 hours. Traps 
every single day during season. 
When things have gotten bad, he's had to go to work at Duran 
Glass (did that for 3 years), but usually you can make a living 
as a bayman, fishing, eeling & trapping. Last year he started 
eeling full time again. "It wasn't a fabulous year, but you can 
get by on 
it." His wife, Janet, has a part time job and that 
helps out. 
Possible to make a living 
if 
you don't have too much 
overhead, 
like new house and new car. His house is paid for and 
his truck 
is almost.

Veach crabbed one year, but doing that demands that you 
devote all 
of your time to 
it, 
so he gave it up. 
"Either you eel 
or you crab or you fish." 
Janet Veach brings in some stuffed wood ducks and shows them 
off. Wood ducks have more color than mallards. Doesn't do much 
duck hunting now, because of 
limit of one black duck. Those ducks 
killed in woods at head of West Creek. Wood ducks stay 
in wooded 
areas and they like freshwater ponds. Shows me pictures of deer 
that they shot. New Jersey deer limit is now six per season. In 
local area there are 2 or 3 groups of people who run deer with 
dogs, which is highly illegal. They kill quite a few. People 
driving along wooded roads with spotlights on are often poachers, 
but sometimes just raccoon hunters or people trying to spot deer. 
Area has quite few raccoon hunters, who run them at night with 
dogs, sunset to sunrise. There's some fox hunting in area, but 
area does not have very many fox. Used to be a $3 bounty on fox, 
years ago. poaching, hunting, crime.

When eeling, they range all 
the way from Bidwell's 
[pronounced, "Bedwell's"J Ditch up to the Delaware Bay Memorial 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 137 
Bridge. They range that far mainly when not much is happening in 
the Delaware Bay. The year they went up to the bridge, they 
didn't find many there, either, because it was a bad year. When 
eels are thick, you don't have to travel far. 
Eels travel and 
feed 24 hours a day. They don't sleep. 
Are constantly on the 
move & if you can stay with them, you can have a good catch every 
day. "But that's the trick, to stay with 'em." You locate them by 
keeping trying pots 
in different locations. Eel usually come to 
same area at same time of year. Sometimes there are more, 
sometimes fewer & usually arrive same time of year at same 
places. Will stay from 1 to 1-1/2 weeks at same place, but never 
over 2 weeks. Have to have pots in all 
areas, to keep track of 
where they're running. When they increase in one spot, you move 
more pots there for a while. An eeling work day runs from 6 a.m. 
to 8 p.m., 
if you have bait. 
If not, you may have to get up at 5 
a.m. to get bait. "They're pretty long days, but I like 
it, 
so 
it's rewarding for me." Thing he 
likes best is not having any 
boss to push him, and being outside. Hated working for Duran 
Glass because it was drudgery working inside. When pushing 
yourself, you know how hard you have to push.

Eel finding often trial and error, keeping pots spread out 
to keep track of their range. To find fish, they usually set 
their nets off the bars, when the tide 
is up, and the fish come 
in on top of bar when tide is up and they follow the "bay line" 
right on up. Each creek has many feet of bars coming out from it. 
You can't stake nets directly into bar because sand is too hard, 
so you go out just past the bar, where sand gets soft. Some times 
of year, you stake your nets, other times, you drift them. Used 
to be regulated by 
law, but those laws abolished. Now you can 
stake or drift any time of year. 
He has done both. At one time, 
the team of Lynwood E. 
(father), Lynwood R., and their partner, 
John Hays, had 57 stake nets 
in use at a time. They use only gill 
nets. He didn't do any drifting this year. Did very little 
fishing this year, because of demands of eeling. 
Drifting described: Net weighted slightly on bottom to get 
bottom to sink. Buoys are on each end, so you can pick them up. 
You stay close by them, or they will drift away 
in a short time. 
100 
Nets drift by themselves and do not have to be hauled 
through the water. Nets can be set "cross tide" (across the tide) 
& they will still swing around somewhat. 
They are usually run up 
& down the beach with the tide. You stay with your net, so you

don't lose 
it. 
Some night fishermen have lighted buoys at ends 
of net to help locate them in the dark. Most boats today have 
built in net reel for shooting and hauling net. Net reel has a 
neutral gear, so after you let end out, you need only move your 
boat forward and net goes out by 
itself. Then you throw other 
buoy end out, wait your time limit -- 1/2 hour or 45 minutes --
and pick 
it up, untie your buoy, and tie net on to 
line on net 
reel, put net 
in gear, & it will pull 
it 
in for you. 
Nets vary 
in dimensions. 
Most are 10' 
or 12' 
deep. 
Has 
seen deeper nets used in channels & farther off shore. Some nets 
are 100 fathoms [600'7 long. 
Most nets are about 30 fathoms 
[180'] long. He mostly uses 30—fathom long x 12' 
deep nets. Net 
has a cork line on top to float it, 
and a lead line on bottom, 
mounted with little lead weights. This holds net vertical. 
200 
Has never done any seining. 
Some 
in area do, especially the 
Bradfords on Buckshutem Road, near Mauricetown. 
They are 6 boys 
and a father who used to haul seine carp all winter in Maurice 
River. 
Would seine under ice 
in midwinter. Went out on 
ice, cut 
a hole, pushed net under ice, then dragged end ashore. 
Close calls on the Delaware Bay described: 
"Yeah, I've had 
a few out there. 
I was out there one day by myself in 
late 
October, 
it was and that morning it had made some 
ice on the boat 
and I didn't really think about it and as I was going to my pots 
to start tendin', the boat, naturally it took on some spray from 
the water and I went to get a pot and I slipped when I was 
pullin' a pot, I slipped, and went over head first into the water 
and the only thing saved me was I grabbed the side o' 
the boat w' 
my arm and hung on and pulled myself back in that—a—way, but it 
was quite cold and I believe if I'd got away from the boat, I 
wouldn'a made it." 
"Myself and Danny Hayes was off the mouth o' 
the river and 
we seen a storm comin' up and we was headin' to the mouth o' 
the 
river and and 
it was within ten minutes, the wind was blowin' so 
hard that one o' 
the barrels in front o' 
the boat blew over and 
he couldn't even go up front to pick it back up and it would just 
knock you down and 
it was raining so hard and by time we got to 
the mouth o' 
the river, there was waves that was breakin' 
into 
the boat they were prob'ly five, six feet high, and there was a 
guy and two little kids in one o' 
the rental boats from Bailey's 
Marina and we took them on the boat, because their boat was 
sinking and we tied their boat to the back o' 
the stern and I put 
my boat, the nose of 
it on the bank 
in the mouth of the river and 
we pulled his boat on out and we sat it out for about forty—five 
minutes 'til 
it passed. They come up Quay Creek. 
Out here 
in the 
bay, 
it can be nice one minute and 
in five minutes, be rough as I 
don't know what.... This was 
in the last part o' 
June." Summer 
squalls sometimes have exceptional amounts of wind. 
Those were 2 
main close calls that he remembers. weather, fishing. 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 140 
300 
His father (Lynwood E.) has had many close calls, too. L.E. 
worked as an enforcement officer for N.J. Shell Fisheries for 14 
years. Knows all oyster grounds in bay. Can tell you anything 
about the bay. Has maps, 
in full detail, of all grounds and bars. 
If L.E. 
is 
in a good mood, he can talk for hours. 
Not too many baymen 
in 
immediate area, but farther down on 
Cape May, there are more commercial fishermen. Mrs. Veach tells 
that there are many laid off factory workers trying to work the 
bay, now, "but they're just not makin' 
it, 
you know." What hurts 
the commercial crabbers is, 
like 
it was one year when a lot of 
people were out of work, they bought 20 or 30 crab pots, and also 
tried to "tend" everybody else's. "They had a lot of 
'fly by 
nighters' and the crabbers that year had a lot o' 
problems with 
'em, a lot o' 
problems.... but mostly what happens to 
'em, these 
crabbers get together and just tell 
'em, 
'We've had enough and we 
catch you doin' this again or that again, it's gonna be it.'" 
L.R. gets on phone and tries to talk L.E. 
into coming and 
talking to me: "You'll 
like him, once you get here." 
400 
Talks about neighbor, Frank Madden, who found a 5 year old 
boy, who had been missing in the woods in winter for 40 hours. 
Shows me newspaper clippings about the incident, which involved 
hundreds of volunteers, helicopters, etc. Madden found him while 
checking a deer stand. Biggest incident in area in years.

G—Delmont; 38GT 
(Lynwood E. Veach [Lynwood R.'s father] 
arrives.) 
(Lynwood E. speaking now.) Have been many changes over the 
years. In old days had only leg hold and stop loss traps. 
Describes differences. Now they use the Conobear trap, which is a 
body hold trap. Conobear traps wouldn't work 
in still water, 
like 
ponds, but worked even better in tidal meadow. Lynwood E. started 
trapping with his dad, as a boy. His father owned a little bit of 
meadow down along Alec's Ditch. Father showed him what he knew, 
and he also learned a lot from a trapper named Stanton Lee. Lee 
was handicapped in his leg, but he got through the meadows all 
right. Trapping used to be a big thing for local people, because 
it subsidized their income. Today, 
it 
is not relatively as 
lucrative. Only for 3 months do you 
have any season. 
State 
lands don't open for trapping 'til 1 January. 
600 
State meadows along Tuckahoe River, Riggins's Ditch, Maurice 
River, Hancock's Harbor, Mad Horse Creek, Ockenoke, Dividing 
Creek. 
Muskrats not as plentiful as they used to be. He blames 
it mainly on spraying for mosquitos. 
Have had local meetings of 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel logs 
page 141 
trappers & fishermen to discuss problems caused by spraying. 
Authorities spray creeks, even though mosquitos breed only in 
stagnant water. L.E. has approached legislators about it , but to 
no avail. Pictures of fish kill once taken to then—Congressman 
Sandman & other politicians. "They generally wind up tellin' you 
that they get a thousand complaints on mosquitos in two or three 
days and maybe one or two from fishermen, and this 
is their 
answer." Hard to prove to Mosquito Commission biologists that 
spray has deleterious effect. Biologists claim it's lack of 
oxygen, but it's coating of water with spray that cuts off 
oxygen. Have had kills for last 10 years. This year had fish kill 
of 
10 million fish, but had no pictures of 
it. Fish killed are 
mostly "food fish for other fish" Ei.e., forage fish], so the 
bigger fish lose their supply of food. Seagulls depleted by this, 
too. They won't eat the killed fish. May be some effect on fish 
by PCB's, too. "For the amount of mosquitos that we still have, I 
don't think a worthy project." Where fish are killed, 
in tidal 
areas, are not where mosquito larvae are found. 
700 
Because spraying is done with airplanes, they can't be exact 
about targeting. So L.E. believes that they need to adopt a more 
exact spraying method, before all fish are killed off. Bulk of 
fish killed are menhaden (bunker), and local menhaden industry is 
extinct. "There's no more fishing with menhaden boats here, 
because they kill the little fish before they grow up. They don't 
fish here at all anymore for 'em." Used to be the Menhaden Bunker 
Factory in North Wildwood by North Cape May. Menhaden there were 
processed for fish oil 
and 
meal. Local conflict summarized: 
"Well, I think the bulk of 
it would be tourists complaintn' about 
mosquitos against the local people here and what few small 
industries there is 
in the fish business." 
insider/ outsider. 
When "food fish" are gone, other fish don't come either and 
if they do eat them then the bigger fish are contaminated, too. 
Not something happening in 1 or 2 years, but over at least 10 
years. They may not be spraying quite as much, but one spraying 
this year killed 10 million fish. The reason it doesn't happen 
every time 
is because small fish are only up 
in the creeks and 
tributaries at certain times, and they should only spray when 
fish are not there to avoid fish kills. Small fish are surface 
feeders and spraying "puts the 
lid on them" and suffocates them. 
They should wait 2 or 3 weeks for the small fish to leave the 
creeks before they spray, but instead they have immutable dates 
on which they spray, no matter what. "Just try it. That's all I 
ask them to do. Just try 
it. Don't spray when the fish are up 
in 
there and just give 'em a chance to get out of the creeks. Once 
they move out and they're not gonna hurt the surface fish. 
The 
bottom fish you won't hurt too much, because he has at least a 
chance to move out, you know, but your surface fish, they don't 
have a chance."

Lynwood E. 
has been trapping & fishing all 
of his life. Used 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel

page 142 
to eel, but now does it only occasionally with Lynwood R. L.E. 
used to spear. Eel 
spearing is now outlawed. People used to spear 
eels through holes in the ice. Now illegal. Some people still do 
it 
illegally. If you find a place under ice where eel 
are bedded, 
you can catch 1/2 bushel 
in a hurry. You can spear two or three 
at a time. L.E. 
likes eel very much, but L.R. doesn't. Eel have 
to be processed just right to make them good. L.E, doesn't care 
for stewed eels, but really likes boiled eels. L.E.'s grandmother 
used to stew eels 
in a gravy. 
L.E. 
likes them parboiled and then 
fried. "It's a delicacy." 
(foodways). 
800 
Also likes smoked eels. Nobody smokes them locally anymore, 
but there used to be a few people who did. For years now, nobody 
has. There may be a few people up 
in Vineland who still smoke 
eels, and there are a few over in Bridgeton who smoke eels, but 
only for their own use. Used to be a lot of eels smoked locally 
for Christmas time. Back then, you could never get enough (at 
Christmas time), because when people found out you had eels for 
sale, word got around and you were cleaned out. 
(celebration). 
Lynwood E. 
has fished for shad, but then shad industry 
changed from a big industry to "practically nothing." Problems of 
monopsony in 
local fisheries market discussed: "It seems like 
when the fish is here, as soon as they hit and you get a few 
thousand pound, the price goes down and fish 
is perishable. You 
have to move it, and maybe you catch 200 pounds a day at, say, 
40, 50 cents. You catch a thousand pound tomorrow or the day 
after tomorrow and they're worth 15 cents, and you have no 
control over it, because it's a perishable product. 
You can't 
eat 'em. There's too many to eat and you can't keep 'em because 
you can't freeze 'em. Your don't have the facilities. You have to 
let 
'em go and I think there's a lot of room for improvement in 
the buyer situation, there. You know I think that would 
straighten that up." 
marketing. 
L.E.: 
"See the man that does the work, you hang your own 
nets. You buy the lease, you buy the rope and 
you have to have 
the knowledge o' hangin' the net. Know how much to take 
it up, 
half, or two thirds, or three quarters, however you want to take 
it up, the amount of slack in the net for catchin' fish and 
incidentally, I'm a 'three quarter man,' I like plenty of slack 
for the fish to tangle up. 
Makes 'em harder to handle, but at 
the same time, you, pretty near every fish that gets 
in the net, 
you will catch it, 
but you gotta hang these nets, you gotta 
weight 'em, 
and put corks on 
'em. You gotta put 'em out in 
the 
bay. Now you have to 
license 'em. 
It's three dollars a net, where 
it used to be nothing in the Delaware Bay and its twenty dollars 
for a drift net, 
let's see, 
it's twenty—five dollars for a haul 
seine. 
Straight settin's twenty dollars....

Licensing in Delaware Bay & its tributaries [probably means 
estuaries] were never subject to 
license until about 3 years ago. 
It was made subject to

have to pay $100 license fee for each eeler.

Delaware Bay were caught in Virginia. Up here you can't seine 
them, but down 
in Virginia, where they still seine, they can get 
15 to 20 ton to a haul. One haul 
like that is as much as a 
Delaware Bay fisherman may catch 
in 3 to 4 weeks. In Virginia, 
they also catch them in 
"fish pounds" (i.e., pound nets). 
conservation, (animal)

Now, striped bass (or "rock" or "stripers") cannot be fished 
commercially. 
Commercial fishermen cannot retain a striped bass 
for any purpose. Gill nets are used to catch shad. 80% of the 
time, any fish caught in a gill net will die, but you can't 
retain a striped bass inadvertently caught in a gill 
net set for 
shad. 
You have to throw him away, even 
if he's dead. Considers 
that a waste. $20 per fish fine for keeping them on your boat. 
If 
he's running shad nets with 5", 5-1/4", or 5-1/2" mesh, 3 to 4 
lb. 
striped bass will be caught in such a net, 
if they happen to 
be coming in. 
He tries to avoid setting them, 
if he knows 
striped bass are coming in, 
but that's not always possible. But 
if 
he catches them, he's killing them for nothing. Sometimes they 
come 
in 
at night, and he can find a ton or 20 boxes of them in 
the net, all 
of which have to be thrown away to avoid X20/ fish 
fine. "And yet, this 
is the kind o' 
laws that your legislators 
give you." Law would work better if 
shad fishing or use of that 
size net were outlawed, because then at least the striped bass 
wouldn't be killed. 
L.E.: 
"But what a waste to take the 'money fish' away from 
you. Well, 
it's the 'sportsmen fish,' the bass, the striped 
bass, and they feel that we're hurtin' 
'em, what few we catch 
here's hurtin' 
'em. 
It never could be. All the fishermen I've 
ever seen out here at one time can't catch what one dragger will 
catch in twenty—four hours and put on the Russian trawler out 
there. In twenty—four hours, all 
season, we won't catch as much. 
In twenty—four hours, when they get into 
'em, well, outside o' 
three mile, now it's outside twelve mile, but when they get into 
schools of 
'em, they'll catch a hundred ton and prob'ly process 
them. They got their thirty or forty small 40 foot draggers out 
there that go to the mother ship. They'll process more 
in twenty— 
four hours than we could catch all year, all 
forty, fifty 
fishermen, and you know, this is quite a ridiculous thing. As far 
as I'm concerned, the legislators aren't lookin' at the fact that 
we're really not helpin' the sportsmen by savin' these fish, 
because they come 
in from the ocean and they go back out. They're 
only penalizin' us, that we can't save them and can't retain 'em 
when we catch 'em 
in our net, because somebody said we shouldn' 
catch 'em." recreation, occupations, fishing 
200 
Lynwood E. doesn't do much hook and line fishing, but he has 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 146 
done some fishing out at the lighthouse, at night, with a hand 
line, shining a light in the water. Would catch two or three or 
maybe four or five 300 lb. barrels at a time. Used to be 2 or 3 
of them did it. 
Now sports fishermen do that and catch 7 , 8 , 
900, or 1000 lbs. 
in 20 or 30 boats. Multiplied by 7 nights a 
week, these so—called "sportsmen" sell them. There's no 
law 
forbidding sports fishermen from selling fish in N.J. Yet they 
complain about net fishermen hurting the fish. Net fishermen have 
to buy a license, besides, which sports fishermen do not. A 
sports fisherman "rigged up right" with the right kind of a boat 
(which would cost quite a lot of money) could make a better 
living than a commercial fisherman. Boats commercial fishermen 
use for nets aren't rigged to run 15 or 18 miles. They're only 
run 4 or 5 miles, and never far from the beach. Down around the 
channel, by the lighthouses, you need a different kind of a boat 
with a greater range. If you were to get a thunderstorm or a 
sudden heavy wind, you'd have to run 15 miles over heavy seas. 
In 
shore tending nets, one can head up 
into the creek within 15 
minutes instead of a 3 or 4 hour run. 
"But there's room for a lot of improvement in the laws, the 
way they're settin' 
'em down, and I'm not sayin' 
it because I'm a 
net fisherman, 'cause I'm a sportsman, too. I like to hunt, and 
as you know, he's told you, I'm a conservation officer, and they 
really don't like for me to, hear me to talk like this because 
you are buckin' the system a little bit. But at the same time, 
every word of 
it's true. They can't deny 
it, 
because they know 
it's facts. 
They know that the fish'II die that're caught in a 
gill 
net, yet you gotta throw 'em away. 
They know the sportsmen 
go out there and work the lighthouses and catch a thousand pound 
and sometimes more. A thousand is minimum for some of 
'em and 
they do this two or three weeks runnin', every night o' 
the 
week.... Sell 
'em, and yet they see a net comin' aboard with 7—, 
800 pound o' 
fish 
in 
it and we're breakin' up their spree. But 
there's no comparison. Where there's one net fisherman, there was 
a hundred sportsmen." 
300 
Sports fishermen are more influential people, so they 
prevail. If sports fishermen had taken fish kill pictures, 
something would have been done. Then they would have stopped, or 
at least looked into 
it. He knows spraying is cause of 
it, 
because between 24 and 72 hours after spraying by plane, a fish 
kill comes. If the fish are 
in the creek, they are always killed 
by spraying. "It would really be nice 
if they would listen a 
little bit to people that had done 
it all their life because with 
the license bit and everything that they've done." 
Sports 
fishermen would rather not have an overabundance of eels because 
of the way that they tangle up gear, yet a commercial eeler can 
only retain 25 eels at a time, even with a $100 license. 
On the 
Inland Waterway, eel 
pots are licensed at $1 per pot from Cape 
May Canal to Raritan Bay, but in the Delaware Bay, 
it's $100 no 
matter how few pots you put out. 25 eels not very many, and 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel logs 
page 147 
pretty soon with all 
of the restrictions, there'll be an 
overabundance of eels. Sports fishermen will then have to figure 
out a way to get rid of them, because 
nobody cares to fish in 
those areas on the rivers where there are nothing but eels. 
recreation, conservation. 
400 
Authorities are seeking revenue with these regulations, yet 
they don't nearly pay for their enforcement, because there are 
probably not more than 1000 nets 
in 
all 
of Delaware Bay, which 
is 
27 miles across and 17 miles from Egg Island to Cape May Point, 
considering the whole thing all the way up to Artificial Island, 
there are probably only 100 licensed nets at $3 a net. 
This 
can't possibly pay for an eleven man patrol crew, each man 
getting at least $16 
or $18,000. They have lieutenants and 
sergeants ashore, and assistants that work 
in the office, 4 or 5 
that work 
in Trenton. Licenses can't possibly pay for all 
that. 
Probably don't take 
in $10,000 in 
license fees. 
All 
of Lynwood R.'s eel 
pots are hand made. Pots bought 
ready made are not like the homemade ones. Manufactured ones are 
all 
identical. 
Homemade ones vary according to their intended 
use. 
In different areas, you have to have different types of 
pots. L.E. describes types of pots: "Well, there's square ones, 
there's round ones. There's what I call a 'sea bass' pot that are 
flat on one side and there's quite a different variety. 
There's 
double funnel, there's single funnel. 
There's freedom funnel 
with a long wire to go 
into where the net mesh is. There's other 
ones that you have to have them right on the end, where they go 
in quick and it's, they're temperamental. Listen, 
if you could 
make a pot that would work everywheres and work all the time, you 
could be a millionaire in couple o' 
years." 
technology 
Round pot works best in strong tide, because as 
it rolls, 
the funnel 
is always exposed. Square ones will end up with their 
door covered up so eels can't get in. 90% of eels "pot" 
backwards, tail first. 
500 
If 
live car is 
left uncovered overnight, all 
of the eels 
will escape, going out tail first. Even if top of 
live car is 3 
or 4 inches out of water, they can still get out. Lynwood E. 
believes that there are at least 9 "species" of eels 
in Delaware 
Bay. Colors of "species" he recognizes include tan, light tan, 
brown, green, 
light green, dark green, and black. 
Some "species" 
may be 
in between in color. "Purple eel" he believes to be crossed 
with moray, because of his teeth. Can give a serious bite and 
they stand on the ends of their tails and nip at the pot. Eeling 
could be a full time business 6 months of the year, possibly year 
round with your own smokehouse. Larger eels (3/4 lb. 
to 3 or 4 
lb.) could be pre—salted and smoked and you could make a full 
time business out of smoked eels. Difficulties would include 
getting suitable smoking fuel, such as fruitwood or hickory. 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel logs 
page 148 
Would have to have reliable supplier of wood. 
If you only smoked 
for yourself, you wouldn't have to worry about health 
regulations. Smoked eel 
could be a good business, but they have 
enough to do with just salting & processing them for bait and live 
market, six months of the year. Then there's time used for fixing 
pots, maintaining boat, motors, and coolers. You could probably 
make a fair living as just an eeler, but you would need to put a 
lot of your money back into equipment all the time. Cooling units 
have to have compressors maintained. Coolers have to be kept at 
34o to 36o F., when it's hot. Coolers maybe good for 6 or 7 
years' use, and cost couple of thousand dollars per unit. After a 
few years have to buy a walk 
in freezer for maybe $5,000. What 
little you get ahead ends up going back into the business. 
600 
Big outboard or inboard motors have to be replaced. 
At 
least now, fiberglass boats can last 30 years with proper care. 
Motors still wear out, no matter how much you baby them. Eeling 
is something that you could survive or make a living with. 
With 
a banner year, you might make a $10,000 surplus, but 
in next year 
or two, that would have to go back replacing pots, nets. Staked 
nets could be damaged by high winds, or by a sportsman coming 
through at night who doesn't see them and cuts them in half. Even 
in designated net areas of the bay, many sportsmen don't know to 
look out for them. A net cut up represents 2-300 hours of time, 
plus time to haul 
it back 
in. Extras that you make by being your 
own boss & being in business for yourself balances out. 3 bad 
years 
in a row, and you have to go to work 
in a factory or 
somewhere to make up the difference. You could stand one bad 
year, but not more. Although Lynwood E. 
has always eeled and 
fished, he has always also had some other job, as well.

Lynwood E. has been a conservation officer 
for D.E.P.'s Fish & Game Division for 9 years. 
Was an 
enforcement officer for Shell Fisheries, starting in 
1952. After 
they planted diseased oysters, they ruined a multi—million dollar 
a year business, bring it down to 
less than a million dollars a 
year. 
A lot of oyster millionaires went broke. This was done "by 
greediness," planting pink oysters that would run right out of 
the shell 
if you picked them up with a shovel. Were only paying 
50c./ bushel, and they only paid 40c./ bushel for "culch," which 
is shell. 
If oysters died, they didn't care, because they built 
the grounds up. People didn't believe that the disease would 
spread through the oysters that they did have, but it did, 
anyway. Industry still spending millions trying to solve the 
problem, such as at the Shell Fish Laboratory. 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 149 
[It 
is important to note that 
local shell fisheries 
biologists do not agree with this diagnosis for the spread of the 
disease {MSX}, that killed off so many of the oysters. The 
disease 
is not believed to be directly contagious from oyster to 
oyster. They believe that the appearance of MSX at the time when 
seed stock from Virginia was 
in use was purely coincidental.] 
Lynwood E. 
shows me a detailed map of the oyster grounds in 
Delaware Bay, which he used to patrol. Describes how they were 
marked at double corners and triple corners then. 
Now there are 
scarcely 15 or 20 grounds marked. Shows where natural seed beds 
were. They opened from False Egg Island to Sound Pigs, about 
10,000 acres more than natural seed beds, and all 
they did was 
deplete more grounds. 
700 
Shows location of Dead Man's Shoal. No more grounds in that 
area either. Shows me on the map, where George Campbell 
lives 
on 
West Creek, which is where Lynwood R. 
docks his boat. 
Lynwood E. was 
in Shell Fisheries Enforcement, before that 
became the responsibility of the Marine Police, at which time he 
went over to D.E.P. Where there are now a maximum of 20,000 
bushels of oysters, there used to be 100,000 bushels per week. 
Planting of disease wiped out much of business in two years' 
time. Kept on bringing in diseased planting stock by tractor 
trailer. Then oysters started dying 2 or 3 miles down the bay 
from where they planted them. The following year that was just a 
dead area. Adoption of power in oystering left no oyster beds 
untouched. L.E. believes that they should have set aside more 
sanctuaries. Looking at map again, shows me where, on range line 
above Dead Man's Shoal, towards Brandywine Shoal, about 1-1/2 
mile below buoy, there were about 60 acres of sanctuary, there, 
where he apprehended five oystermen catching oysters "as big as 
your hand," and paying $50/ day [in bribes?] to work there. 
He 
arrested them, but he was rewarded by being transferred and 
"thrown out of a job, " while they only had to pay $100 fines. 
Most of the oysters caught now are of the smaller size, 
known as "cullentines," because they are afraid to 
let them get 
big enough to be "selects" because they get good enough price for 
"cullentines," and 
in another year they might die. 
if you can run 
20,000 bushels of "cullentines" at, say, $15 per bushel, 
it 
doesn't pay to 
leave them for another year and get $22 per 
bushel, 
if you can only get 5000 or fewer bushels. 
800 
"They can make up their mind to die at any time between 
'cullentines' and up to 'selects.'" Retailed oysters (in the 
shell) are practically unavailable in area anymore. Jack King 
used to sell a few. Now they get $27 per bushel for 
"cullentines," retail, and then you still have to open them. You 
might get 15 pints out of that, 
if they're really fat. When 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 150 
oysters were plentiful, you could buy a bushel for $1.25 and you 
could pick out kind you wanted -- "deep cupped," "narrow cupped," 
"rank cups," or "cullentines." You could go to every dock and 
every one had them. There were several big oyster docks on the 
Maurice River Township side of the Maurice River. There was an 
enormous oyster house on the Maurice River Twp. side called F.F. 
East, which was directly across the Maurice River from where the 
laboratory is now. That was one of biggest oyster shucking houses 
around, but now there's no evidence of 
it ever having been there. 
Had their own buildings there for their help. The D.E.P. was no 
help, either. 
Lists creeks where oystering took place, back when 
Lynwood E. was an enforcement officer: Bidwell's Ditch, Dennis's 
Creek, Old Goshen, East Creek, West Creek, Riggens's Ditch, 
Maurice River, Oranoaken, Dividing Creek, Straight Creek,...

Lynwood E. speaking: Delaware Bay supposedly once had the 
richest natural oyster beds 
in the world. Spread of the disease 
(MSX) "cost a lot o' 
people everything they had." Some 
businessmen lost millions. Didn't hurt Frank Wheaton much, 
because he has plants all 
over U.S. and South America. Wheaton 
and Robert L. Morgan have bought into oystering more deeply with 
the thought that it will come back. They need to put culch 
in the 
undiseased creeks to help with spawning of seed oysters. One year 
reeds along creeks were breaking down with the weight of oyster 
spats, because there was no culch (shell) on the bottom. That 
happens only when tide and temperature coincide exactly, 
otherwise the spats die by the millions. (animal) 
100 
If all conditions perfect, many spats grow to be oysters. 
Smaller oysters, known as "cullentines" also called "cocktail 
oysters." L.E. calls them "rack outs" (the "old school" name for 
them). Cullentines narrow and long shelled. L.E. 
likes them raw, 
but not L.R. L.R. 
likes them best fried. L.E. 
likes the smaller 
clams raw, but not the larger ones. (foodways) 
General conversation about outdoorsmanship. Surprisingly 
many people have never tasted such seafoods as eels, crabs, 
oysters. Janet says many have never eaten muskrat & L.E. concurs. 
The Veaches like muskrat, which is 
lean, but 'possum is too 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel logs 
page 152 
greasy for their taste. (animal) 
200 
Muskrats live on fresh roots, which are always washed before 
being eaten. Many people won't eat muskrats because of their 
similarity to "barn rats." L.E. believes that there is no 
connection between muskrats and rats. 
L.E. cooks muskrat and likes 
it, 
but his wife won't eat it. 
Muskrat is parboiled 15-20 minutes and then fried. Meat is cut 
into pieces like rabbit. Muskrat sometimes called "marsh rabbit." 
Muskrat have very little fat. Some local people like raccoon, 
which is also greasy like 'possum. Muskrat floured and egged 
before frying, and eaten like fried chicken. Sometimes egg and 
cracker crumbs used for batter. 
L.E.: "I hope you can do somethin' with some o' 
this stuff, 
because the rate this bay 
is goin' out here, I'll 
tell you.... In 
my grandson's day, I don't think you'll have any net fishing or 
anything in Delaware Bay, not the rate they're going.... They 
gotta change what some o'the things that they're doing, some o' 
the things that's hurting so bad, you know? And one o' 
the main 
ones 
is that spray deal. The license bit'II never hurt it, 
but 
it's such a waste to have the license, 
like I say, with the shad 
nets, that you can't save the 'stripers,' because eighty per cent 
of them' 11 
die anyway if they've been 
in the gill net." 
conservation, pollution 
300 
L.E. did not put out any shad nets this year, because he 
didn't want to see all those striped bass go to waste. "And you 
know you're bound to catch some, I mean, 
if you know they're 
comin', that's a different story, but you can't put a sign up 
say, 
'Hey! Shad nets here. Go around the corner.' That can't be 
done, you know?" 
In spring, shad head up to the heads of the rivers, 
including the Delaware, to spawn. Shad can begin running in 
late 
March, but it's usually not 'til April that they start. 
May 
usually best shad month. Then you can catch them well up the Bay 
and the coves. That's when you can catch 6 or 7 lb. fish with 
big "braces" (roe sacks), containing up to a pound of roe. 
fishing 
Lynwood R. 
talks about one time when they caught so many 
shad that they flooded the market and the marketer sent them back 
shad that they had already shipped. Had to pay freight up and 
back. 
L.E. tells how after 30 boxes came back, they took the roe 
out and threw the fish overboard. "It's like I said, there's no 
happy medium for the buyers and the fishermen. He knows you got a 
product's gonna go bad. You can't eat it and you can't keep 
it, 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 153 
so you gotta take what you can get for it. I always said, they 
had a little shelf about six inches wide and they take their hand 
in their pocket, when you got a lot o' 
fish and they throw the 
change up there and what hits there's what you get." 
As many 
millions of people on the Eastern Seaboard as there are, there's 
no way 20 fishermen each catching 2000 lbs. of fish to a total 
of 
40.000 pounds could glut the fish market. So when you catch 2 
tons, the price goes from 40c. or 50c./ lb. 
down to 15c., "you 
know there has to be somethin' wrong in Denmark." 
marketing 
Shad are caught mostly for their roe. Shad meat very good, 
but filleting them ("boning") takes a great deal 
of skill. L.E. 
considers shad "the best eatin' fish there is." It's like a 
herring, but very bony. 
400 
There are a number of people around who are skilled at it. 
L.E. can do it, 
but he finds it hard. 
If he 
is going to bake one, 
he will fix it with lemon juice to soften the bones. A local 
herring called "jack shad" 
is often scored (rows of cuts made 
through meat about 1/4" apart to render bones edible). Jack shad 
also called "American herring" or "flat herring" to distinguish 
it from the "Norwegian herring." Jack shad caught when roe not 
far advanced and scored 1/4" apart and fried "good and brown" 
is 
one of tastiest fishes around. L.E. can easily eat a dozen. Most 
shad eaten locally are baked after being scored, and not filleted 
out. Scored shad are basted with a lemon sauce while baking to 
soften the bones. Baked shad are often stuffed, 
like chicken, 
only with a fish stuffing. As L.E. was growing up, his 
grandmother used to fix baked shad a few times a year. 
His 
mother didn't care for them. When he was growing up, they didn't 
eat much baked fish -- not even striped bass (which is usually 
baked, locally.) They always preferred fried fish. (foodways) 
L.E. describes how to bone a shad: It's best to first skin 
it. That exposes the four layers of bones that are down each 
side, that run oblique to the rib bones, and each layer has to be 
cut out. Bones are easy to see, when shad are skinned. If you 
don't skin them, then you have to fillet them first, and then cut 
out the layers of bones from the inside side. The small bones run 
opposite in direction to the ribs. There are four rows: one up 
near top of back, another in middle, and two down near the rib 
cage. You have to use a very sharp and thin knife. Shad boners at 
Dill's in Bridgeton work 8 hours a day boning shad. People down 
in Cape May who skin flounders don't have to pull 
off skin. They 
merely out it 
loose 
in one "zip." technology 
500 
Only practiced people can do 
it efficiently. As soon as you 
take the skin off a shad, you can see the rows of bones. If you 
fillet it first, you can see the lines where the bones are, from 
behind. When shad 
is bringing 20c./lb. 
in the market, filleted 
shad retails'for about $2.50/lb.

were poaching the sanctuary. Civil Service said he couldn't take

return to work. He was not allowed to work

almost 11 years, and when he finally went back to work, 
it was 
with D.E.P. Fish & Game Division. So he only has 21 years of 
service, 
instead of 32. Was able to keep his seniority because he 
was never able to get a hearing, because they kept postponing it. 
If he had gotten a hearing, he would have been reinstated, 
because his transfer was illegal, but you cannot sue the State 
without their permission. His case was overlooked when he went to 
work for Fish & Game Div., or they would never have let him 
become a game warden. When he first went back to work, they had 
an opening in Salem for a provisional employee and they had an 
opening 
in Ocean County. When they interviewed him, they only had 
an opening 
in northern Passaic County, right on the New York 
State Line, so he worked there for 15 months. They sent him there 
thinking he would quit, but he didn't. 
Then they made him go 
through the N.J. State Police Academy, when he was 46 years old. 
He took that for 13-1/2 weeks and graduated and an officer in 
Atlantic County died, so he asked to be transferred there. His 
superior officers approved the transfer, but Cokingham, the 
Director of Fish & Game, refused to allow it, 
so L.E. sued him 
for discrimination and he was transferred in 
14 days.

Does much of the same kind of work as Herschel Beebe, 
except that Lynwood E. works that local area, whereas Beebe 
ranges all 
over southern New Jersey out of an office in Camden. 
Beebe is a "road N.C.O."

Beebe used to work that area . "He's been pretty rough as a 
warden. He's the kind of a guy that if 
he gets you, he'll tell 
you, 
'If my mother can't do 
it, you can't do 
it.' He's a 'book 
man.'" Lynwood E. Veach feels that he himself will never be as 
good an officer as Beebe, because he gives people a break, 
if he 
thinks they just made a mistake. Veach often just gives trivial 
violators warnings instead of tickets. 
Beebe had that territory 
for 14 years. Beebe has caught just about every outlaw in the 
area. Veach doesn't care for those outlaws who are writing the 
graffiti on the road. 
If he catches them "doggin'" (running deer 
with dogs), he arrests them. These are people who do 
it for the 
"sport." It's hard to catch them, because you have to catch them 
with the deer or see them shoot it, 
and they communicate via C.B. 
radio. 
Veach's patrolling range 
is over 260 sq. miles.

Conservation officer is also responsible for fishermen, trappers, 
squirrel hunters, rabbit hunters, etc. 
Today (11/11) 
is 
last day of deer bow hunting season. 
Tomorrow (11/12) is first day of small game season (in effect, 
pheasant season, locally.) One officer has a lot of 
responsibility in a large area. Lynwood R. works with L.E. as his 
deputy, but that position is unpaid, so he can't afford to take 
time off from his livelihood. One deputy conservation officer a 
few years ago was badly injured when a "deer jacker" rammed his 
truck. 
His truck was totaled, he had $300,000 in medical bills, 
and now he's crippled and can no 
longer work as a contractor. 
State gives him only $25 a week, up to $1000. The insurance that 
they have for deputy conservation officers is only collectible 
upon death. They just recently raised the weekly payments to $50.

L.E.: 
Only a few local 
"deer jackers" do it for profit. 
There are a few known professional poachers operating out of 
Hammonton and Atlantic City. Poachers hard to catch and they'll 
ram your car. You have to have them completely surrounded. "It's 
a testing job and it's fully as dangerous as some people think 
it 
is, 
because some o' 
these people, every man you approach at 
night, 
if he's deer jackin', he's got a gun and it's loaded, and 
it's not a question of whether you think it's loaded or not, he's 
got the gun and the spotlight and 
in this day and age, you never 
know who might get excited, and you ain't got much of a chance 
with buckshot or you know...." poaching, crime. 
Lynwood R. 
talks about one case that's still pending from 
1979. They caught 2 poachers in Meerwald's field near Woodbine. 
L.E. starts telling about it: 
"We had a case down at 
Meerwald's field, down there, abreast o' 
Woodbine. It's the first 
day o' 
deer season, early 
in the morning about 2 o'clock. He was 
coming out of the back field. We thought we had heard a shot back 
there, so we dropped 
in behind him and I pulled up alongside his 
station wagon to stop him and he stopped. We throwed the light 
in 
the back o' 
the station wagon and you could see a gun case. We 
didn't know whether there was any gun there or not, but a gun 
case 
is a pretty good sign they got a gun, you know and he got 
Lund--$3 Reel—to—reel logs 
page 156 
out to go around the car and the guy backed up and I thought he 
tried to run over him [i.e., Lynwood R.)," 
L.R.. "He did." 
L.E.: "Which I still think he did, he tried to back over 
him. So when he backed up, naturally, I backed down the road with 
him. When he started ahead, he wasn't gonna stop, so I cut him 
off and forced him to stop, and he hit the bumper of my car. I'd, 
he's either have to go 
into the woods or run into me. Well, we 
couldn't find no gun after we got him out o' 
the car. Was a 
Puerto Rican fellow and a colored fellow and they had been known 
before, a few o' 
the other officers, this guy here had stopped 
him a couple o' 
weeks before and they wouldn't get out o' 
the car 
for him. Instead of makin' them get out, he just looked through 
the window and let 'em go. 
Well, that just made 'em that much 
harder to handle the next time somebody else stopped 'em. So, we 
got 'em out the car, we had the State Police come here and all 
on 
account of where they contacted a vehicle. So I charged him for 
resisting an officer, trying to elude, and interference. We 
couldn't charge him for the gun and deer huntin' because we 
couldn't find the gun and we took 
it into court and the lower 
court found him guilty and he appealed it through the Public 
Defender and the County Court judge reversed it and they had to 
give him his money back. Even though he pretty near run over him 
and everything and they lied on the transcript, the two days o' 
hearings. 
It was, aw, you should'a heard, 
it was ridiculous. So 
then he turned around and sued me and the State. It's been 
pending ever since. 
They just had a hearing on 
it this past 
Monday and the lawyer notified us, said, 
'Don't bother going down 
there,' says, 
'They'll take 
it from the transcript.' So, I don't, 
hey, they here about a year ago, 
it's been two years, about a 
year ago, they asked me 
if they, they said, 
'Hey. How about if we 
settle it? Give the man twenty—five hundred or three thousand.' I 
said, 
'Don't give him a nickel.'The man was dead wrong and I 
would never go along with giving him five cents, because you give 
a guy like this even five hundred dollars and he's gonna be quick 
to do the same thing again, 
if 
he can, because he's dead wrong. 
He was wrong all the way and there was no reason for the judge, 
the County Circuit Judge should'a never reversed the decision, 
Judge O'Neill. I don't know what kind of a transcript they gave 
him off o' 
that tape, but it couldn't'a been what we, what 
actually took place, because there was no way they could'a found 
him not guilty. But they give him his money back and they never 
did tell me what happened but I'm dead against givin' him any 
money. I won't give him nothin'. The Deputy Attorney General told 
me, he says, 
'The next time you stop him like that, take him out 
through the wing, the vehicle.' He says, 
'He won't get out, take 
him out,' and course the State Police told us that night, too. 
Now you hate to do bodily harm to anybody, unless it comes right 
down to where they're tryin' to hurt you."

Lynwood E. 
talks about the importance of consistency in 
testimony, because any discrepancy can cause you to lose a case. 
L.E. will only charge you for what he sees you doing. 
If you 
have an 
illegal deer, he'll charge you for an 
illegal deer, but 
not for shooting it, unless he sees you do 
it. Will never testify 
to something he didn't see. 
L.E.: No game violation cases are criminal. 
They're all 
civil, even with a firearm. It only changes to criminal, 
if 
there's a failure to appear or contempt of court.

Lynwood E.: A lot of strange things happen 
in 
law 
enforcement, especially in civil cases like these. The only way 
fish & game violations are criminal are, 
if you are carrying a 
rifle or shotgun without an I.D. card, under Title 2—C, 
it's 
criminal. That violation has a mandatory $500 minimum fine and a 
suspended 6—month sentence. That comes under jurisdiction of 
State Police. L.E. always calls a State Policeman in such a case. 
In a fish & game violation, the State Police call him. 
If L.E. 
finds a motor vehicle violation or a Title 2—C, they are 
empowered to enforce these other laws, but if they see criminal 
violations, like drunken driving or "controlled dangerous 
substance" they call 
in the State Police or municipal police. 
100 
L.E. describes typical poaching violation arrest: 
They're 
watching a field, a guy pulls up & shoots deer; driver gets out 
to get the deer; they pull up alongside; get the driver; get his 
license; get him for killing deer out of season; 
if the deer is 
killed, get him for illegal possession of the deer; 
if 
he has 
buckshot, charge him for "illegal missile." 
All these charges 
are $100 minimum fines up to $300. Judge can take first for $100, 
& second two for $300, each, making $700. 
Anyone over 18 
in the 
car can be charged for the same offenses, as they are all 
considered to have been hunting. Firearms are seized, but when 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 159 
they pay fine, the firearms have to be returned. In New York 
State, you have to forfeit your vehicle and firearm, permanently. 
When he worked in Passaic County, he used to work 
in cooperation 
with New York State conservation officers. New York State 
violations are still civil, despite that. 
New Jersey law says, 
"you may" seize vehicle & firearm, but New York law says, "you 
shall." In Shell Fisheries Enforcement, New Jersey law says, "you 
shall seize equipment." Catching poachers is generally 
in 
response to reports of shooting. People report shooting at such 
places as Dr. Lumen's field, the Peasley tract, the Bevins tract, 
the Simcue field, the Chambers field. They know the names of most 
of the places. If 
it's consistent in one area, they may work the 
area every other night. L.E.: "Because you'll be sittin' there 
watchin' the field and 
if you may, he may not come the first 
night, but he'll be there the second night, 
if he's been 
consistent, he'll be there and you can, you get a chance to write 
him up, 
if you can catch him." poaching, 
law enforcement, naming.

L.R.: "Well, usually where they're shootin's where all 
the 
deer's at anyway." L.E.: 
Poachers hunt where the deer feed at 
night. Most of the work is sitting and waiting. In summer when 
hunting 
is out, they spend most of time enforcing fishing 
regulations. There are always some people who like to try fishing 
without a license, even though license 
is only $10, and fine 
is 
$35. Only freshwater sports fishing is 
licensed. The same people 
sneak around gravel pits fishing for sunfish or bass, and get 
caught, year after year. Some unlicensed fishermen will 
run away 
to escape apprehension. recreation, (animal). 
L.E. talks about the strenuous requirements that he had to 
meet at the State Police Academy. He lost 23 lbs. when he went 
through there at at the age of 46. They made him do that, because 
they thought that would make him drop out. Eeling, fishing, and 
trapping had kept him in good enough shape so that he could make 
it, 
unlike 
if 
he had been working in a factory. In trapping, you 
walk miles some days, and 
if you're running late, you end up 
hurrying.

The Veaches own considerable acreage of meadows, which they 
trap. L.E.: "We own quite a few acres of meadow right around 
here. Well, I shouldn' say we own 
it. I got the deeds to 
it. You 
can't ditch it; 
you can't hay 
it; 
you can't bank 
it. The State 
don't let you do anything with it. You can pay the taxes on 
it 
for and own it for a hundred years, yet you can't do nothin' with 
it without their permit and they won't give you a permit to do 
anything to it. That's what they call 
the 'Wetlands Act,' and 
them are all 
the provisions from the State, but it 
isn't hardly 
fair. 
government, conservation. 
Yeah, now, 
if I was gonna, say, you owned a hundred acres 
next to me where I got a hundred acres, and I'm gonna ditch 
it 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel 
logs 
page 160 
and 
it's gonna hurt yours, then I'd say you should have the right 
to say something. Why should somebody sittin' 
in Trenton tell me 
I can't, tell me I can't ditch my meadow, when he ain't maybe 
don't own ten foot o' 
land in the whole state and I got two 
or 
three hundred acres and they tell me I can't do nothin' to 
it? 
This 
is ridiculous, you know? When they, they don't say, 
'Well, 
we'll pay your taxes for you.' I can pay the taxes, but I can't 
do nothin' to 
it. 
It's like the bill that they're tryin' to pass 
now to cut wood, 
if you wanna burn a wood stove down here 
in the 
'suburbs,' 
if 
you burn wood stove, they're gonna make you get a 
permit to cut wood, your own wood. This is ridiculous! I mean, 
who really has the right to tell me, 
if I own twenty—five acres 
o' 
woodland, that I can't cut it and burn its 
 But,there's no 
doubt in my mind, they might not get it now, but they'll get it 
later.... Well, 
it's a little bit unconstitutional, yeah, that's 
to me, you're start being a little bit o' 
dictatorship there, 
if 
you start tellin' a person, 
if I own the land and I'm payin' the 
taxes on 
it and I gotta get permit from you to go get four or 
five trees to burn, there's somethin' wrong.... Yes, 
if I was 
gonna do harm to somebody else, 
like I said, that's a different 
story altogether. Yeah, 
if you was my neighbor and I'm harmin' 
you, you got a right to say sump'n. Sure, you got, you're livin' 
there too, but not somebody sittin' up there that don't even know 
what they're talkin' about."

Lynwood E. talks about close calls on the 
Delaware Bay: 
"Well, I think about the worst one I ever had workin' was I 
was up off Egg Island one time one day. I was on a 23—footer and 
I had a fellow by name of Johnny Hayes with me and we had about 
2500 pound o' 
eels on and we come out o' 
Straight Creek and we 
had to come by Egg Island and 
it was blowin' and a storm come up 
and 
it was blowin' maybe forty, forty—five mile an hour and I 
knew if we started down we couldn' turn aroun' 
'cause there was 
no way you could go head to 
it with this low boat. They was low 
garveys and we talked it over, we decided we ought to go. He 
wanted to go more than I did, but I must'a wanted to go 
'cause I 
went, too. So we took the life jackets and put 'em on. But we 
started and he thought we oughta change our mind after we 
started. 
Well, there was no question we couldn't turn around. 
She would'a breached as soon as you turned 'er, 
'cause those seas 
were runnin' twenty foot, eighteen, twenty feet and you could 
look 
in the troughs of the sea and 
it sounded like freight 
trains.

[400] 
"You could look off shore and see the buoys off shore 
in the

page 161 
channel and when we got down to Egg Island, didn't take long to 
get there 'cause nor'west wind. 
Took maybe twenty minutes or so, 
but you had to run the throttle and run right on top o' 
the crest 
o' 
the swells all 
the time because if you run too far down, you 
run the bow under and 
if you and 
if the motor ever stopped, you'd 
lose her anyhow, but if you started to back off or the other way, 
you had to give her the power. We had hundred—horse Mercury on 
'er. And when we rounded Egg Island, we were level full wi' 
water. The only thing was keepin' her 'float was the power. The 
decks, she was right up to your knees, just everything was full 
wi' water and the outboard kept runnin'. We run about another 
two, three mile into Ockenoke and she drained off. But that's 
what you call a stupid mistake, because we coulda laid 
in the 
creek 'ere protected, landlocked no swell and three or four hours 
after we had that close call, the wind all 
died out. So that 
three or four hours coulda cost us the boat and our life and that 
was just one. I've had several times I've been out there and got 
caught in 
it and tried to get in. I had you [Lynwood R.] once. I 
was tendin' nets. When it blowed the water, blowed the water so 
hard, blowed solid sheets o' 
water steady across the boat. It was 
just pickin' the water right up, but we've been fortunate. 
There's times you get caught, you know and the only thing you can 
do 
is try to get ashore. I've seen people capsize up the bay on 
oyster boat." weather 
L.R.: "He's found people,too." 
L.E.: "I've found people drownded, several." 
L.R.: "You even found one trappin', Matt Schenck." 
L.E.: "Yeah, I've found 'em where they fell through the 
ice, 
trappin', drownded, and I've found 'em 
in the bay. Every year, 
we'd find one or two 
in the bay when patrollin' the bay." 
J.L.: "Were those the people, most o' 
the people that took 
chances?" 
L.E.: "Yeah. They didn't get the second chance." 
L.R.: "Stayed too long." 
L.E.: "They just don't, 
it's, Nature doesn't play games." 
L.R.. "Right." 
L.E.: "And you may get away with 
it once or twicet, but if 
you play long enough, when they give you, 
it gives you a warning, 
as a rule. You'll have five or ten minute warning and that's 
long. Lot o' 
times, you don't get five minutes and 
if you're 
watchin' for it and you 
leave, you'll be glad you did because 
that five minutes'll save your life. You could go a good ways, 
you know, before the sea gets rough. Now I lost one of the best 
friends of my, that I ever had 
in my life, I lost him duckin'. He 
got lost duckin' and got caught in a storm. That was on Egg 
Island. He got caught in a snowstorm and he couldn't make it back 
to the boat in Ockenoke. We found him next morning, sun shining 
nice, no storm, but he was dead." 
J.L.: "What'd he die of exposure or did he...?" 
L.E.: "Yeah. When he fell, he fell on his face in the meadow 
and he never turned his head and he just, he was dead when he hit 
the meadow." 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel logs 
page 162 
L.R.: "Well, 
it was a drivin' snow, right?" 
L.E.: "Twenty-three year old." 
L.R.: "A just loss of direction, really." 
J.L.: "Oh, so you couldn't really see, when the snow was 
drivin' 
like that." 
L.E.: "No, 
it was hail 
and snow mixed and it was after it 
got dark, there was no way he could find out where he was going. 
Then he just walked 'til 
he couldn't go no farther. If he could, 
if 
he hadn't got, I think he got upset because there was a lot o 
elders and they were dry 
in the wintertime they're dry, duckin' 
season and we always carried matches and could'a got down behind 
the elders and built a little fire in his poncho, you know, and 
got a litle warm and he might'a got 
wet and really cold, but he 
could'a lived, but I think he exerted hisself to..." 
[5001 
L.R.. "Panicked." 
L.R.: "...the extent to where he panicked and he just drove 
hisself, maybe walkin' 
in circles. You could, you couldn't tell." 
L.R.: "Right." 
L.E.: "But when he hit the meadow, he was 
dead. He'd never turned his head." 
L.E.: "I've patrolled in the bay with a forty footer and 
I've left the river in the morning with a fog you can't see only 
the top o' 
the oyster masts on the oyster schooners about forty 
foot in the air, you'd see the top two or three foot and never 
see no more'n that all 
day. Go out o' 
the Maurice River and run 
all 
day long. You could see the corners when you get to 
'em, but 
I mean, you'd have to be right on top of 
'em, you know, and run 
back to the river the same way, work all 
day and the fog never 
clear up 
in the wintertime." 
In fog had to navigate with compass. Would know where he was 
when he saw a "double corner." Once you were familiar with the 
grounds and corners, you could recognize your location. 
L.E. talks about a bow hunter about 3 weeks ago whom he had 
to go 
look for after he didn't return home. Had been up a tree 
in 
a deer stand, and coming down, the top rung broke and he fell and 
broke his neck and was killed. "You can't be too cautious about 
something twenty-five, thirty foot in the air, because that's 
just the right distance, 
if 
you hit on your head, you gonna break 
your neck. That's what happened to him, broke his neck." 
L.E.: Bow hunters' stands rarely more than 10 or 12 feet up. 
The higher stands are shotgun stands. It would be very hard to 
kill a deer with a bow from 25 or 30 feet up.

L.R.: "Well you had, you had the day that the planks come 
off the bottom of the boat up the river." 
L.E.: "Yeah. I was comin' 
into, usin' the eelin' boat one 
day, they was garveys and I come around the corner on the Reach, 
Nor'wes' Reach on the river and a boat went by carrying a swell

page 163 
and I backed off on the power, naturally, but the boat was still 
goin' pretty good with the weight into her and she hit and a 
plank came off all 
the way across on the bow. So the water run 
in 
the front and run out the back where the two, I had two engines 
on 
'er and the water run over where the engines was, I run her 
all 
the way into the drydock. Water run 
in the front, and right 
out the back." 
L.E. says that most of the wooden garveys in use locally are 
built on the Atlantic Coast, especially around Tuckerton. 30 
years ago a lot of them built in Coppertown and Leeds Point. The 
typical ones are "partial 
'V' 
garveys," built of cedar, which is 
why his still floated after losing a plank. "'Five—quarter' cedar 
is heavy cedar." As 
long as engine pushed it, 
that gave 
it enough 
buoyancy to stay afloat. Too big a motor, like a 120, 
125, or 
130, would add too much weight and take the stern down. 
Empty

and 
it won't go down. Motor's weight will sink it, 
though. 
wood. 
L.R. mentions the late Whitey Holliday, who used to build 
bateaux nearby. L.E. says all 
the old nearby boatbuilders are 
gone. Garveys "a thing of the past," being replaced by 
fiberglass, because of 
its longevity and less need for 
maintenance. Aluminum boats not used in the bay, but trappers use 
them in creeks and ditches. Fiberglass boats used are prams or 
little "bow boats," like Lynwood R. 
has. Aluminum boats not 
satisfactory because the rivets pull through. No garvey builders 
left along the bay. There are still caulkers [pronounced, 
"corkers"] left in area to repair wooden oyster boats. George 
Camp, Tom Lee, and a few others are still caulkers. Used to be 
people who only caulked oyster boats and garveys, full time. New 
oyster boat ["Robert C. Morgan"] 
is steel.

L.E.: "But that Bob [Robert L.] Morgan, there, I knewed 
his 
dad [Robert C.] better'n I knew him. He was the one got, his 
barge run over him up at the canal, Chesapeake Canal? He had a 
tug boat, 
'Bay Buddy,' they called 'er, and he was towin' a 
barge, heavy barge, Navy barge. The tugboat stalled, he went down 
to start the engine and he couldn't get it started, and the tide 
was fair tide behind the barge and she run right over the tugboat 
and drownded him." 
J.L.: "Oh, no kiddin'?" 
L.E.: "Yeah. Right while he was in the boat. 
He never come 
back out." 
J.L.: 
"I didn't know that. I figured he died a natural 
death." 
L.E.: "No, he died accidental. That was right at the mouth 
of the Chesapeake Canal." 
J.L.: "How long ago was that?" 
L.E.: "Oh, dear. That was before Godfrey got killed." 
L.R.: "Yeah, we had another guy from down here, happened the 
same way. He got killed the same way."

L.E.: "He got throwed overboard." 
L.R.: "I thought the barge hit him, too." 
L.E.: "No, tanker run into the side of the barge that he was 
standin' on the barge and threw him over. It's been better'n ten 
years." 
L.E. says he's a poor judge of time, because he's the age 
where time passes so fast. 
L.R.: "Who's the one that drownded out in the bay, 
Robinson?" 
L.E.: "Carne) Robinson. What, he was the fisherman. Expert 
swimmer. Used to swim to the pound nets off 
in the ocean with a 
line tied on him, tie the line on to pull the boat in next to the 
net. He went up here to East Point, and he put, he had some shad 
nets overboard. It was blowin' and 
it wasn't real 
nasty but it 
was blowin' hard enough so that he shouln't'a been alone. He was 
alone and the old deputy warden, Jesse Ford, who used to live on 
East Point Road, the Cad Walter estate, he was standing in the 
parking lot talkin' to him, that's how close to the beach he was 
and he said, well, he's gonna try to pull his nets and he says 
he's goin' down to West Creek where we tie our boat. He 
had his 
skiff 
in there, had a little 26—foot skiff. So Jess left him and 
he went up on the bow to pull the anchor. 
He pulled the anchor 
and she was rollin' 
in the sea 'cause she was a sea skiff and 
she's round bottom and he had ahold o' 
the hand hold, comin' back 
and the hand hold come off 
in his hand. Instead o' 
comin' ashore, 
to save his boat..." 
L.R.: "She was 
in gear, wasn't she?" 
L.E.: "She was just idlin' 
in gear, but all 
the 
two to one 
reduction gear on them will just snug just enough so that the 
prop'II turn. Well, the wind was blowin' nor'west, 
it was blowin' 
her off shore and down. He could'a walked ashore from where he 
was. 
It was only up about to his chest. He swam after the boat 
and the boat was goin' faster than he couldn't catch her and he 
got too far and the time he got his, he couldn't get back 
in. He 
drownded right there. And he was just talkin' to the guy, he was 
only from here to the highway off the beach. But see that's 
another time that he wasn't thinkin'. We got his boat the next 
day, I was on the Guard boat and we went out on the Drum Beds 
down on the Cape Shore, where the long seine shoals are on the 
Drum Beds, and she was settin' right there just still runnin', 
idle, but he wasn't on her. I said, we was hopin' he was on her 
when we found it, 
but he wasn't on her." narrative 
L.E.: "Like I said, when you're monkeyin' with water or 
nature, you better hope that when you give it a thought, you do 
the right thing, because, 
lotta times you don't get your second 
chance." 90% of time it's poor judgement that leads to a death, 
and practically all 
the time 
in accidental shootings. 
People 
sometimes shoot at things they don't really know what they are. 
Not really very many hunting accidents in area, considering 
amount of hunters in area. They hear about accidents all over the 
state. 
One bad shooting in area caused by someone getting in 
Lund--83 Reel—to—reel logs

truck with a loaded gun, and gun going off and shooting him in 
the back. Luckily it was a Ford truck, with cross members on the 
seat, and the shot hit right on the cross members, thus saving 
the victim's life, but injuring him badly. Boy was retarded and 
wasn't supposed to gun unsupervised and nobody was supervising 
him. 
hunting, accidents 
800 
He was given a license only with understanding that he 
wouldn't hunt without a relative supervising him. 
In Pennsylvania 
and Maine, 
in some counties, the schools are closed the first day 
of hunting season. Lynwood E. 
likes to hunt but won't hunt in 
game reserves the first day of the season, because too many 
hunters, then. It's surprising how few accidents they have. Birds 
jump and fly along top of grass and people shoot at them from all 
directions. There are many fights over who shot a particular 
bird, when it goes down. George Campbell's private gunning 
preserve is very expensive to use, only wealthy people can afford 
it. 
It used to be $9 per bird, plus $250 a year dues, so 
if 
you 
wanted 10 birds released, that was $90.
