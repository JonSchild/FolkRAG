She never comes down in t•:e morning till nine, 
And then she's dre sed up like a

When ready for business she stands at the bar, 
And jokes with young follows whoever they are. 
But I 
am the daisy she seems to lik best, 
She pays more attention to me than the rest, 
She's my darling, and some day when we are alone, 
I'll ask her if she'll be Mistress Malone,

I'm a

I 
carry on business down-town; 
Every morning at eight me breakfast I 
eat, 
With coffee and doughnuts clone brown. 
The ladies they all at me smile, 
For I 
dress in the latest of style, 
And the boys on the street when ever I 
meet, 
Say bow do you do Boquet Doyle. 
C
HORUS. 
Boquets I 
wear in my coat, 
Da ies and Posies and Pink and White ros.ts 
With Perfume I'm ready to choke, 
Ohl carry me out or I'll die. 
I'm out every night till just about dawn 
And up with the Lark in the morn; 
Sure just before dark I 
walk through the park. 
And feed all the sparrows with corn. 
The Mayor of the city knows me, 
And with him I 
often do dine; 
And whenever I 
meet a 
poor man on the street. 
I 
always do give him a

Soft I 
sing of Mattie, dear, 
Sweetest young maiden far or near; 
Dearest yet, she's my pet, 
Warmitur, up my heart so queer. 
On the fires of love that lie 
In the sweet corners of her eye, 
Oh, I'm gone, I'm killed with joy, 
Abut my Mattie, dear. 
Ctionus: 
Mattie mine, girl so fine,—Syrtt. 
Dearest yet, she's my pet.—Sym, 
She's the belie, the daisy grand, 
Sure she's the Queen of Ire_and.; 
On my royal head I'd stand, 
For my sweet Mattie, dear. 
In a 
dry good's store below, 
Juggling silks and c:diee; 
All the day there she'll stay, 
Wasting her sweet life away. 
Oh, if I 
had gold in store, 
I 
would let her work no morz-
For it's in a 
birdi2's cage, 
put my Mattie, dear. 
IVIcGrogan the Cop. 
By Chas. Dockstader 
Sung with acces by Pat Reilly. 
My rittne is licGrogan, an Irish policeman, 
I 
come from ould Erin's green soil; 
just threw a 
street ear about twenty feet, 
Fin the most datage:ous wan on the squad. 
All the thieves and the blackguards I 
frighten to death, 
When I 
go out on the street, 
They turn pale when I 
say, " Take yerselves away," 
For McGrogan will soon clear the beat. 
CHORUS. 
Move on there, ye black uards, look out for McGrogan, 
Just t‘vet.ty-one days from the sod, 
With DI y club and my gun I 
can beat any one, 
For :\hGrrogan's the pride of the squad 
I'll be sergeant next month with the say of two men, 
For they know I'm a 
sound Democrat; 
If I 
hadn't this mug they'd run me for judge, 
But I 
ant too party for that. 
I 
could wed a 
fine daisy, on me she is crazy, 
Her father once carried the hod, 
And if they don't take care I'll be running for mayor. 
For McGrogan's the pride of the squad.

AN IRISH 
ECITA NON. 
Del ;rrred by the gr_atEival of Henry Ward Beecher and 
13„b In.gerscil. 
Pat Reilly. 
MeTurlc was a 
cross-eyed Granger, 
Who came here front Kalamazoo; 
Ho looked like a 
living skeleton, 
Nutt a 
saw mill had cat in two. 
Ha; wife was a 
second cousin 
To Mulcahey's cousin Dan, 
And it was believed by all the family 
That MeTurk was a 
handsome man. 
He met with a 
raFroad accident, 
And lost four out of his five wits, 
lie was so ugly if he looked at a 
kicking mule, 
he'd. scare the animal into tits. 
A. wart as big as a 
door knob, 
On the end of his red nose grew, 
lie would fall apart only he was stuck 
Together with 6palding's glue, 
And. the sparrows and Jersey crows, 
In winter time used to warm themselves 
At the fire on the end of his nose. 
He never changed his linen, 
He lived on the free lunch plan, 
And now ain't it funny, 
Because be had money, 
The Bowery girls called hiTi honey, 
And said AleTurk was a 
handsome man.

Before a

As I

Like salt I

But though I

For Mulhooly's bon ton, yez can bet. 
When riti out a

They sometimes get jealous and get in a

A Waltz Song, uti by I

Reilly. 
I've got a 
daughter named Rose, 
Sweet seventdim is her . age; 
She dances around on her toes, 
And gets big bouquets on the stage. 
He form, when in tights, is divine, 
Tony Pastor does treat her to vine; 
She skips like a 
goat, like a 
fairy she floats, 
And they say she is li e 
her papa. 
CHORUS. 
Hes hair s 
blonde and her eyes are blue, 
The size of her foot is twenty-two, 
Her bangs are stuck to her head wi h 
glue, 
She's handsome like her papa, 
The paint on her cheeks makes her blush, 
Her nose from bad whiskey is red, 
She can warble a 
song like a 
thrush, 
And sling both her feet round her head. 
Then men with bald heads at her gli.nce, 
Her dresses are all made in France, 
In a 
dog- cart cupe she drives on every day, 
With a 
coachman just like her paw.

THE GEM OF THE SEA, 
Written by rAT REILLY. 
With nil condescension fa turn your attention, 
To what 1

And without hesiitition, I'd silo -A

Became of c

It happe:icil one looming

That vein's

And he that t-aut

IIt.tr pinions t''re soaking and would not give pite . 
Till Nep!tme, who knew her be..::.nt to pursue her 
In order to woo her, the w-letted old Jew ; 
And he very nih caught her on the top of the water. 
Great Jupiter's daughter \Oa() cried philaloo. 
So love, the f'rreat geni'.is looked down ant'. saw Yeittis, 
And Neptune so heinous purs.ding her Nild; 
So be roar:al out

And sure ' t.t,vas. no won.Ier fo - teasing Ids child, 
So ast:tr that wasflvi

Where it tumbled like winking on Neptune whilc.

That Her was dryiani not,h l

Thus plain is the story, ca'e s;Ti down from glory, 
That Erin so hoary is a 
heaven on earth. 
So Venus. liunpee zeatly cm Erin so stately, 
Bat fainted cv se lat-ly so bothered and pressed; 
Which timelt did hewitticr but ,.- re it, had killed her.

Hence how can yes blame as tint', Erin's so famous, 
For bo.uty arid murder and whiskey and love.

THE BROKEN DOWN GENTLEMAN, 
WrItten by JAMES RICHMOND, for and sung by PAT REILLY 
with great success. 
Air—What Do You Say. 
I 
am Senator McCann and ex-Alderman, 
I've refused the President's chair; 
I 
eat *Webster's Dictionary for pills, 
I've made a 
fortune bottling air; 
If I 
was President, I'd have the Mississippi River 
run dry, 
I'd make girls wear mustaches and pants; • 
We'd have moonlight picnics in the clouds, 
And dance an Irish Can Can dance. 
CHORUS: 
I'd make all the Chinese do washing free, 
Hang the organ grinders for fun; 
Oh, I'll build an iron ladder to heaven, 
When the Brooklyn Bridge is done. 
I'd put all the old maids upon the Police, 
In the Gas House I'd put Jim Blaine; 
I'd have a 
tunnel under the Atlantic Ocean, 
And have a 
law to prevent snow and rain; 
I'd paint the moon, kalsomine the clouds, 
Whitewash the stars and sun; 
You can live forever, have your breath insured, 
When the Brooklyn Bridge is done.

Recitation. 
,Vrittex) by JAMES RICHMOND for PAT REILLY, and recited by hi:, 
with great success. 
McNally stood on a 
barrel of flour, 
Trying to earn a 
stamp; 
Lecturing for politicians, some one 
Hollered you are a 
tramp; 
You are a 
liar! says McNally, 
I 
can prove you are a 
bum; 
Alt, cheese it Jack, don't guy him, 
The J 
is full of rum. 
Forty years ago I 
was a 
banker, 
And lived in finest style; 
I 
had an only daughter, 
The beauty for many a 
mile; 
She fell in love with a 
blackguard, 
One Terry Ryan by name, 
Who made me make my will to them 
On the plea i 
was insane—oh! 
Soon I 
was forsaken, 
And left in pain to groan; 
And I

IT WAS THE CAT.

Wr:tten by " James Richmond '' for PAT Rbuf.i.y. And d•diver,-! 
with gre;tt, success. 
The boy stood on the edge of a 
razor, 
Trying to shave his toes; 
He was throwing bricks at his, little sister, 
And bal.incing eggs upon his nose. • 
His father's lead pipe was all cut up. 
To make bullets for the Fourth of July; 
But when ins father found it out, 
He made him a 
present of a 
lovely big black c 
Little Mikey swore he'd be revenged, 
And kept up to his belief: 
So be killed the cat for supper one .

And told the family it was corn-beef. 
They all took sick and nearly died 
From the ugly grease and fat. 
And when the doctor asked who done it, 
He said, " Be Heavens, it was the cat."

I've a 
daughter Clarabel, 
She's a 
rose- burl rich and rare; 
She wears her brother's' derby 
And she bangs her own false hair. 
Her nose is Greco-Roman, 
Her chromo you can see; 
Just gaze upon the father 
Of sweet Clarabel Magee. 
CHORUS. 
Of so sweet is Clarabel—Break. 
She smashes every swell—Break. 
When she is at a 
ball 
'Twould break your heart to see, 
How mashers fight to get a 
dance 
With Clarabel Magee. 
Ohl she has lots of beauss, 
There is now a 
bitter strife 
Between Millionaires and Aldermen, 
To get her for a 
wife; 
P,ays she I 
can't marry all, 
Says I 
then chuck the dice and see 
What happy man will win the hand 
Of Clarabel Magee.

I 
am a 
purty Irish widower of thirty, 
Married again now sure I'd like to be; 
My wife she died from being teniperate, 
Of children I 
have only three; 
There is Tommy, Johanna and Katie, 
The eldest just eight years old! 
They're as purty as any Yankee children, 
I 
wouldn't sell them for their weight in gold. 
CHORUS: 
Then if there is a 
nice, young lady here, 
Let her write a 
love letter to me; 
For a 
husband she could find no better, 
Than the Honorable Mr. Jeremiah McGee. 
I 
don't want a 
flirt or a 
masher, 
I'd like a 
saleslady or a 
dry goods' clerk; 
I 
want an industrious young lady, 
That can do a 
good day's hard work; 
I'd love her as long as I 
am living, 
If my orphans she does admire; 
She'll have to cook the breakfast in the morning. ; 
Scrub the floor and make the fire.

Out of Employment. 
RECIT A TION. 
Written by DAN SULLY for Miss DAISY REMINGTON, and recited by he 
with great success in the principal theatres. 
Out ef employment, starvation in view, 
N OW what has a 
poor man in my place to do? 
Wc.try I 
wander, careworn and sad, 
I'm looking for work, and there's none to be had. 
Choosing rather to die than to beg or to steal, 
Th, sharp pangs of hunger I 
try to conceal; 
Wcary I 
wander, sadly I 
roam, 
To earn food for the little ones starving at home. 
Vain, vain are those tears, but still they will flow, 
To yield to despair is womanly. I 
know ; 
I 
must choke down the lump which will rise in my throat, 
And strive to live on, though I 
have not a 
groat. 
Yes, I'll strive to live on, though again and again 
Does the mad thought of suicide flash through my brain; 
Dinnerless, supperless, still I 
must roam, 
To earn food for the little ones starving at home. 
Now, why should a 
man, be he Christian or Turk, 
Be doomed to such hardships while he's willing to wor. 
For months I've been wandering half crazed through 
your town, 
Till my strength is nigh gone and I'm quite broken down. 
Oh, God : it were better, perhaps, to be dead, 
For they won't give me work, and I 
can - t 
beg my bread; 
No money, no work, sadly I 
roam. 
There's no help for the little ones starving at home.

We pleyed the tunes that everybody knew, 
The music it was sweet and each note so true, 
And showed just what the Land League Band could do. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! the ladies and the babies that live on the street, 
Applaud with their hand and keep time wi h

Come all you jolly sailor boys and listen unto me, 
While I

It's of a

For twenty years before the mast on board the Bugaboo. 
At every party in the town, 
Where all the spielers can be found 
Wherever they are we're always around 
To Snow what we can do. 
We went to Brady's house last night, 
The bass horn player put out the light, 
Which nearly ended in a

But was stopped by the Laud League Band.

To walk home Mary Grogan was afraid, 
And the divil a

And b'iling drunk till daylight there we stayed,

Mrs. Mulligan and meself took apartments fine, 
Along the road of the elevated line ; 
'Twas the other night, at tin. whin we'd both got into bed 
That we heard a 
terrible racket right up over head ; 
I. rushed up to the roof to see what was the row, 
Whin I 
saw all of our neighbors' cats having a 
pow- wow ; 
I 
wint down to Mrs. Mulligan to have her come and see 
The greatest sight she iver saw since she left old Killkenny. 
There was Murphy's great big Torn Cat,who was as black as jet . 
Making love to Mrs. Finnegan's Puss and 1\li-s O'Hara's let: 
There was Miss l'agan's pretty Malte.-e and Miss Malony'sTom, 
With twinty more upon the roof to have their midnight song ; 
Bad luck to yez, says Mrs. Mulligan, but we'll put a 
stop to this, 
And see if our nights cannot be spent in quietude and bliss ; 
So together we descended to get ready for the throng 
Of all our Neighbors' Pn;sy Cats, should they begin their song. 
We waited for an hour or more, and diyil a 
sound did we hear, 
But a 
me'ow now and then froi-a 
O'Brien's cat who lived back in 
the rear ; 
And just as me eyes were closed for the balance of the night, 
Mrs. Mulligan gave a 
veil that set me all afriaht : 
Saying, Pat, don't you lirear the cats again, 0, 'norther, such a 
That I 
hardly knew, whin I 
jumped up, that I 
was myself at all 
So to the roof we wint again, prepared to make them fly, 
Mrs. Mulligan threw the broom at them, but it struck me in 
the eye. 
0, scz I, now Mrs. Mulligan, don't be taking me for a 
cat, 
But before I 
finished the sintence,another blow knocked me flat; 
I 
thin jumped up, exci,ed, and began to yell \yid pain, 
And went for Mrs. Mulligan for not taking better aim ; 
And the cats flew in all directions as they scampered out of sight, 
But Mrs. Mulligan made me sleep upon the roof that night ; 
So I'll move me hoard and lodging away from these French flats, 
And go to a &cent place to live where the neighbors don't 
keep cats.

FRED TELL THEM TO STOP 
- " 
Written and composed by GEORG E ALF-EN. 
Sang by EDWI.N BARRY. 
His latest hit. 
No doubt you have heard of the great fancy fair, 
That used to take place every day; 
Well, I 
thought for amusement I'd take my girl there 
To pass a 
dull hour away; 
We went iu you must know, and saw Barnuna's show, 
Van Amburgh's menagerie, as well; 
There were round-about swings, and all kinds of things 
Forget the day I 
never shall. 
DIALoGLTE.—Yes! when we got in the fair, my girl 
wanted to have a 
ride in the swing. 
I 
said, all right, my 
darling; but directly the swing went a 
little too high, sht? 
lustily cried 
Cuottus: 
Oh, Fred, tell them to stop, 
That was the cry of laria; 
The more she said whoa, they said, let it go, 
And the swing went a 
little bit higher. 
The people that stood round of course they all laughed 
But I 
only said, stop the swing; 
There were four or five others in boats beside us, 
Saying, master don't do such a 
thing; 
Then four or five roughs caught hold of the ropes, 
Maria fell down on her knees; 
And one of them said, the-young man's getting red, 
But isn't he having a 
spree. 
DIALOGUE.—Amil Maria still cried out at the top of he: 
voice— ( Chorus). 
They soon stopped the swing, Maria jumped out, 
And quickly fell down on the floor; 
They brought her some water, which soon brought 
her to, 
The girl I 
now do adore ; 
Should you ever go there, to the great fancy fair, 
Friends, take advice while I 
sing; 
Of the great round-about, it's the best fun that's out, 
And finish the day with a 
swing. 
DIALOGUE.—Amd when you take a 
girl with you, mak:, 
her promise she won't call out— (Chorus).

MY ELDEST DAUGHTER CLARA.

Witten by James Richmond for Pat Rooney and sung 
by him with great success. 
Sure I 
have a 
lovely daughter. 
On the stage she cuts a 
dash. 
She wears blonde wigs and powders her face, 
To try and catch a 
mash. 
She can dance a 
tailor's hornpipe. 
She tells the old woman that she is fine, 
She wears flesh colored pants when sh.t comes 
out to dance, 
And gets drunk on German wine. 
CHORUS. 
She wears dizzy diamonds and wings on her back, [ break 
In the ballet dance she is like a 
jumping jack, [break 
She has a 
barrel of paint on her face, 
Like a 
fairy from Conamarra, 
The pride of the McCormick family, 
Is my eldest daughter Clara. 
You should see her in the can-can, 
She is the dead picture of her ma, 
She has a 
foot as big as a 
telegraph pole, 
Her features are like her pa. 
She has all the swells near crazy, 
An engagement for life she has signed, 
She is hitched to a

He has a

But Ow loafers say I

But worse than that, they killed my eldest son, 
Those dirty loafers and bums; 
They holler McNally, chase yourself up the alley 
And shave the whiskers off your gums.

Dropped it cannon ball on my head;

McCormick had a 
Jack-ass. 
Blind in the teeth, lame in one eye' 
lie had a 
celebrated record, 
For eating water and drinking pie; 
This Jack-ass was a 
high kicker, 
He won many an undisputed prize; 
He kicked out seven rows of Mrs. Murphy's troth, 
And jabbed out both her eyes. 
McCormick's Mule 
This mule was born in Ireland, 
He wears the Shamrock on his nose; 
At the Centennial he stole an iron safe, 
And dressed himself in a 
suit of clothes: 
He broke into a 
Jewelry store, 
Stabbed the proprietor with a 
nail; 
Chased four Policeman into the river, 
And set fire to the Jail. 
McCormick's Mule 
McCormick was arrested, and produced the mule, 
For him all the neighbors had a 
grudge; 
He slapped the Jury in the mouth with his tail, 
And kicked the neck-tie off the Judge; 
The mule escaped, and they held McCormick, 
For the doings of the mule he was tried; 
He was just getting ten years' sentence, 
When a 
telegram came the mule had died.

That Boston, beauteous city was on fire, 
And sinking ' neatli the fiend's relentless hand.

Fire! fire

In every breeze that passed us by, 
And Oi the world did heave a 
sigh of pitg ; 
Fervent prayers to Heaven to aid, 
Before the tire in ruins laid, 
Fair Boston, beauteous city. 
And an through the terrible commotion, 
'lie wind blew a 
gale from ofr the ocean, 
The brave firemen \von-A-A with all devotion, 
To laugh at t:,eir efforts yet It seemed; 
And soared wit tiley pray- A' still higher, 
O'er chimney top, steeple and church spire, 
Till all was one vast flame 01 fire, 
And the light around the horizon gleamed. 
Fri

From the rule of a

But the bra • -- hearted tire:nen and we .hanic,

BEAUTY, CHERRY NORINE. 
Br JEAN E. 
FOR 
AL. 
To M. T. M. Urso-Lrn. 
Sweetly beaming, softly streaming— 
Blue eyes, golden hair; 
Pearly teeth with whiteness gleaming. 
Fairest of the fair; 
Brightly gliding, lightly gliding 
Through the mazy dance; 
Half exposing, and half hiding, 
Charms that all entrance. 
CHORUS. 
Merry, laughing Cherry Norine. 
Sweetest darling Cherry Norine; 
Blue eyed beauty, sweetly dreaming, 
Golden hair so softly streaming, 
My heart's enchained with love. 
Form of fairy, winsome, airy, 
Movements of a 
sprite; 
Brighter gem than decks the starry 
Diadem of night; 
Rose tints wreathing, perfume breathing, 
Cheeks and ruby lips; 
Chains of love unconscious weaving, 
Where'er her footstep tripe. 
Merry. laughing, kt 
What the measure ? Gods would treasure 
Such transcendent bliss; 
Oh! the deep, enchanting pleasure— 
One ecstatic kiss! 
Still to love her, still to hover 
Near her, and to gaze 
Into orbs whose liquid lustre 
Brightens all pile's days.

A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. 
J. 
FISHER'S, No. 21

friend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would 
only encourage the had habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunatly, there is 
enough of it done without any further necessity of explaining "how. 
when and where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initi-
ate the uncorrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Evenina Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a 
neat. little 
book, bound in Morrocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt." published by A. J. FtstiEn, No. 24 Vesey Street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting. and of the ineaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
.s nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might 
afford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recom-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."

These Cards are arranged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia-

and K for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. 
The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under 
standing. 
Many professional Furtune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a 
way as to be non-committal. 
Many_young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too difff 
(1,entoistroo fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
quotttcon. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
