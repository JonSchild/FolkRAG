Announcement at head of tape by Phil and Steve. 
Vito relates his story of coming to the United States. 
He was 19 
when he left Italy to come here to help his father build a house. 
They first went to Naples and stayed for two weeks before they 
could contact the American Consulate to get their papers. 
A man 
told them they could see the Consulate if they bribed the gate 
keeper which they did. 
(Had to lean against gate with five-
dollar bills sticking out of pockets; money taken, then gate 
opened.) 
They took the boat and after two days the seas were 
wild and Vito got sick. 
He describes the accommodations on the 
boat which were not very good and the weather was bad also. 
Rusted tinware to eat from. 
Porthole windows broke--panicked 
people. 
Three days bad weather. They had to drink ocean water 
and there were large lice. 
The third class were all from Italy, 
which was Where Vito was, down in the bottom. 
"Like animals." 
They landed in Boston. 
He was lost--stayed in station all night. 
He took a train to 
Pennsylvania the next day where his Uncle was to pick him up. 
But he didn't show up and Vito stayed at the station and then 
went with a mailman who took him to a hotel. 
He felt very lost. 
The next day he showed a women at the hotel an envelope that had 
his uncle's address on it and they were able to get him to come 
and pick up Vito. 
There was snow on the ground--two feet deep--
and it was the first he saw. (Recalls that one reason he left 
Italy was to avoid military service.) 
He stayed with his uncle 
and helped him with his milk cows. 
But Vito had come to make 
money and didn't want to mess around. 
Also had an offer to be a 
hired hand nearby but didn't interest him. 
Another Uncle worked 
in Pittsburgh shoveling ashes from the factories and Vito went to 
work with him. 
He worked for Polish bosses first then for an 
Italian. 
They worked cleaning ashes out of railroad cars, then 
he was a water boy and took water to the other workers. 
2 
Vito's father then came over and they worked together screening 
ashes from the coke ovens. 
It, paid $5.00 per day. 
They then 
worked in a coal mine for a couple weeks, then back to the ash 
screening business. 
They lived in a boarding house and paid 
$3.50/month. 
Then moved to Sunnyside, UT to work in the mine. 
(An uncle 
already there--but things weren't as good as he wrote.) 
They 
were told to drink tea, not water, in mine. 
One man's daily 
comment was, "no one died last night." 
They worked the night 
shift for seven months at 6 days a week. 
They had a hard time 
finding a place to live and made little money. 
They counted on 
friends to help them out. 
Finally found a tarpaper shack. 
Then in 1922 (May 2) came a big strike. 
Lasted 7 months. 
Vito 
describes life during the strike and relates stories of trying to 
keep scabs from entering the mine. 
Threw them out of house--
lived in tents. 
Bread. 
They had a system to alert each other 
when scabs were coming. 
Tried to stop them by barricading road. 
Then a friend from Nicatro (Italy) shot out a tire from a car 
taking scabs to the mine and, another shot at the train carrying 
them too. 
All knives, forks confiscated. 
Each time the National 
Guard came after them. 
All strikers imprisoned in school--
without water. 
They lost the strike and went back to work. 
The 
company didn't recognize the union. 
His father went back to 
Sunnyside, but Vito didn't want to go back there and work the 
night shift. 
But he wasn't able to find work at any other mine. 
His name, Bonac.ci worked against him (because name of a union 
organizer). 
His uncle helped support he and his father during 
that period. 
Vito finally got a job with the Union Pacific 
Railway. 
He worked loading gravel all over the West.

crushed--rock took heel right off shoe. 
Always disliked being in 
mine. 
Began when he was in his 50s. 
After nearly being hurt, he 
asked to be laid off when the next round of lay-offs came and 
then he decided to take his pension in 1963. 
He had been having 
other health problems. 
His union pension was only $60/month and 
they lived on that for two years. 
Their families helped them out 
with food.

a tear gas bomb. 
Since that, time he hasn't felt good about 
Price.

The scabs came from 
Huntington, UT. 
Vito says that after the 1922 strikes the men 
from the farms in Emery county [LDS farming country] came to work 
as scabs and they -stayed when the strike was over. 
Never were 
there before. 
[I.e., scabs were LDS, for the most part.] 
Filomena describes her family's arrival in the United States. 
Her father brought the family here in 1908. 
He had been in the 
United States about 15 years before that. 
He returned to Italy 
every five years to see his family (at which time his wife would 
get pregnant again). Her father lived in the East, Boston and New 
York at first. 
Later he moved to Castle Gate to work in the coke 
ovens and stayed in Utah from then on. 
Filomena thinks he heard 
about the work here through friends. 
Filomena says her mother 
remembered the trip over as very difficult. 
Had 2 kids and was 
pregnant. 
kids were sick. 
Filomena was born in Sunnyside. 
On 
the trip over, her mother had to lay over in Napoli, because of a 
typhoon, for a month.

one about a man they knew who wasn't very smart (Gallo?). 
Her 
mother couldn't speak English and told stories in the evening as 
entertainment for the children.

(Cries as she does). 
Boys on train in WWII asked to kiss her 
"because she looked like their mothers." 
She invited them to eat 
at her house next time they came. 
Vito used to sing often. 
He sang "0 sole mio", "Santa Lucia", 
and many others that he can't remember. 
He says several of his 
friends in Italy would walk around and sing while they tried to 
find girls that they could talk to. 
Could only talk to girls in 
Church, husking corn, or at water fountain. 
He said that in the 
United States, now, the girls come and see the boys! 
(He 
disapproves.) 
3 
Filomena tells their moron/trickster story: 
His mother gives him 
a ricotta to take to his girlfriend. 
He puts it "between his 
shirt and his pants." 
The girl asks, "What have you got?" 
He 
answers, "I've got it right here!" (pointing to his pants). 
She 
says "Get out of my house!" 
[Laughter] 
In another story he is 
supposed to watch the money collected during the procession of a 
Sainti image. 
He takes the money and leaves. 
Filomena, 
laughing, says "He wasn't so dumb then!" 
Vito, Filomena, and their two boys visited Italy and they really

Mary was the only one of the sisters born in Italy. 
Their 
parents were from San Giovane in Fiore. 
The sisters discuss the 
stories their parents told about life 
 in Italy. 
Their mother, 
Maria Teresa Cortese, picked figs for two cents a day. 
Cortese's 
father died of what she called asthma when he was =-. 
A month 
after Cortese married, her husband (the Nick sisters' father) 
went to the United States. 
He didn't see Mary until she was five 
years old, and they think: that's why he favored Ange the next 
oldest daughter because he knew her better. 
They said it was 
difficult for Mary. 
The family, 
 consisting of Mary and her mother came over in the 
cattle car section of a boat. 
They weren't allowed to come the 
first time because they had a contagious condition on their eyes 
and were held in Naples for three or four months. 
Mary was 
raised by her grandmother and she had a difficult time leaving 
her when she came to the U.S. 
The sisters think: Mary must have 
missed her grandmother terribly and relate a story of how Mary 
crocheted a large bedspread and sold raffle tickets in the 
surrounding communities to raise money to bring her grandmother 
to the U.S. 
When their father found out he was upset because he 
saw it as a form of begging and she had to give the money back:. 
Mary continued communication with her grandmother, but nobody 
ever- went back to see her, nor did she get to come to the U.S. 
All of the Nick: sisters' uncles eventually moved to this country. 
Kerry describes the uncles and where they settled. 
They think: 
Mary was effected negatively by her move to the U.S.--became very 
insecure. 
The Nick sisters' father was in the Italian military and 
travelled throughout Italy when he was a young man. 
Mary was scared of the statue of Liberty when she saw it in New 
2 
York. 
When they crossed the plains in Kansas on their way to 
Utah they saw prairie dogs and one man thought they were rabbits. 
Their father settled in West Virginia first and worked in the 
coal mines, and then in the silver mines in Tonapah, Nevada. 
He 
also worked in California. 
Then he came to Sunnysi.de, Utah, to 
work: and worked all the mines in the county. 
The family 
 lived 
 in 
a tent in Hiawatha. 
They recall a story about their sister 
Angela's dress catching fire. 
They lived in the tent for years. 
Story about a neighbor killing a pig for the first time. 
The pig 
got away and ran awhile before they caught it. 
A special stew 
was always made out of the neck: when the prig was butchered, and 
the family got sick and died from the stew they made from the 
runaway pig. 
Lead poisoning. 
Their father butchered hogs and 
cattle for people in the area. 
He had special tools. 
He didn't 
use a bullet. 
Usually he used a kind of knife that he made 
himself. 
Joe Nick: has it today. They looked forward to 
butchering in October. 
They made sausage and blood pudding. 
They all remember liking 
the pudding. 
It had cinnamon, sugar and raisins in it. 
The 
pudding had to be made while the blood was still warm. 
The 
family 
 had g_ood milk, but none of them drank: milk or rarely ate 
the cheese that they made. 
Cheese was made from milk from their own cows. 
While the milk: 
was warm it was strained into a large container on the stove. 
When the milk was lukewarm, 
half a rennet tablet was put into 
about four gallons and stirred. 
When the milk cooled, it 
coagulated and was then stirred. 
The whey separated from the 
curd and both were saved. 
The whey was put back onto the stove 
and made to boil. 
1/2 cup of vinegar was then added and stirred. 
Two cups of curd would then result in "rigotta" (cottage cheese). 
It was eaten fresh, or let stand into a hard cheese. 
Sometimes 
goat milk was used. 
"Ci. ngoppa" was the fresh 
 cheese left 
 after 
the separation. 
For provolone the curd was let to stand for 
several days. 
Then the cheese, sliced, was dropped into boiling 
water. The melted strings of cheese were gathered and molded and 
shaped into an old milk: bottle. 
A head was left for it to be 
hung and dried. 
The longer it dried, the tastier it became. 
The provolone cheese was let stand and it got stronger the longer 
it stood. 
They liked their cheese dry and strong. 
They also ate 
cheese fried. 
It was sliced and fried. 
The cheese was dried in 
a shed made by their father. 
There was also a smoke shed. 
They describe bread baking as the most fascinating thing they dial 
on the farm. 
Once a week: at night a 100 pound sack of flour 
would be opened and 25 pounds removed. 
Their family had 12 
children. 
The sponge was made in a large pot by using salt, 
flour-, warm water and one yeast cake. 
The sponge sat overnight 
and was overflowing by morning. 
The sponge was called a 
crescenta. 
The rest of the flour was put in a #3 tub (about 36 
inches) and as 
well made in the center. 
The whole sponge was put 
in the well. 
It was mixed, which was difficult and took: almost 
an hour. 
Three crosses were put on the whole lump of dough. 
She 
still does this today. 
It rose for about two hours, it was 
punched down and let rise another hour. 
15 square towels about 
36" square, made from cement sacks, were kept for wrapping the 
dough. 
One and a half pounds of dough was taken from the large 
lump,  made into a ball and placed 
 on a floured 
 towel. 
The 
corners of the towel were lapped over each other loosely and then 
placed on a wooden plank:. 
The dough was allowed to raise once 
again in the house. 
About 45 minutes before the bread was to be 
baked the outside oven was lit. 
Their oven was built on a 36'' 
high platform so the bakers didn't have to bend over to use it.

Interview continues 
A large fire was built in the oven which was quite large. 
They 
think: it was partly because their family became large, but also 
because their father wanted to prove to the neighbors that he 
could improve on the basic oven design. 
Their oven was in a shed 
that had a cement floor. 
A family lived in it once during a 
strike. 
They say it was the nicest oven they ever saw. 
It was, 
torn down. 
When the fire burnt down, the heat in the oven was 
tested. 
When the oven was hot enough, the interior of the oven 
would be white rather than black: and smok:ey. 
A mop was used to 
clean the oven floor. 
Then flour was thrown into the oven and if 
it burned the oven was too hot and a wet mop was used to cool it 
down. 
When the temperature was right the planks with the bread 
on them were taken into the shed. 
A paddle was used to put the 
loaves into the oven to bake and flipped so that they fell onto 
the floor of the oven. 
They spaced the loaves so they wouldn't 
touch each other during baking. 
A gunny sack: was placed in the 
pipe so the heat wouldo t escape, and the door- to the oven 
closed. 
Their oven was also unique in that it had a beautiful 
iron door. 
Most people had a plain piece of wood. 
Their father-
built the door. 
The bread was checked after- 1/2 hour. 
If the 
bread was baking too fast, the flue stopper was taken out so the 
heat could escape. 
The bread was baked 45-br=a minutes. 
Enough 
dough was reserved for a pitta which had tomato sauce, anchovies 
or sardines, or cracklings (1 eft-ovens of lard rendering) . The 
bread was removed from the ovens one-by-one using the paddle. 
It 
was stored in a laundry trunk: made of heavy canvas with a wood 
frame in the fruit cellar. 
As children, the Nick: sisters say, 
they tore off the crust from the fresh bread and ran to the 
garden and ate fresh vegetables with the fresh bread crust. 
The 
whole process took most of the day. 
They baked bread the same 
2 
day each week:, either Friday or Saturday. 
Mary was married in 19^7. 
They laugh about how she is teased 
that she didn't do much on the farm. 
Ange was the "glamour puss'' 
and always had jobs in town. 
When Paulmina grew up, she took 
over and was their mother's favorite child. 
They say with regret that the bread isn't made any longer. 
Also 
the cheese and salami aren't made any longer. 
(Josephine and 
Paulmina leave) 
Kerry says no salami she has ever seen holds a 
candle to her father's salami. 
She discusses the variety of 
salamis her father used to make and how. 
She recalls the good 
flavor of a ham that was four years old. 
He used apple wood to 
smoke the hams and they didn't need to be cooked. 
Some sausage 
was kept in a crock: of rendered lard. 
Liver and lung sausages 
were made also. 
Spices were fennel seed; red, black, white 
pepper; salt. 
The only thing not used of the pig was the squeal. 
The feet were pickled, and head cheese made using the head and 
all the left overs from all the other sausages, lard rendering, 
feet pickling, etc. 
The cellar- held all their food stores. 
Potatoes were dumped into 
a bin from the outside and were separated into sizes. 
There was 
a bin each for wheat, barley, oats, dried corn and vegetables. 
Everything was grown on the farm. 
They raised celery which was a 
delicate process because the whole head must be covered with soil 
so it will maintain a closed shape. 
It was left in the garden 
until needed and could even be harvested in the winter. 
It was 
the same with endive and carrots. 
A section of the cellar was 
reserved for fruits. 
Their mother had three shelving areas for 
jams and canned fruits and pickles that were so crisp "you could 
hear- someone eating them a block away.'' 
During the depression they didn't 
 know there were any problems 
because their way of life didn't change. 
They butchered a 
chicken every Sunday which was spaghetti and chicken day. 
One 
chicken fed the entire family. 
Their brother f=rank: got one 
drumstick and was fed first. 
Kerry felt lucky if they got the 
neck. 
Their parents bought the family 
 farm in 1918 for $3,000. 
0. 
The 
papers were final  in the spring of 1919. 
They say their father 
had a great deal of foresight because today the land is 
considered the best in Carbon County. 
Everyone loves the way 
their home is built half way up the hill. 
Their father moved 
from Hiawatha to Spring Glen in 1916. 
Two children were born in 
Spring Glen, and then they moved to the farm. 
Martin, Josephine 
and Paulmina were born on the farm. 
In Spring Glen, their father worked in the Kenilworth mine. 
He 
had to walk: the seven miles up hill to the mine, and in the 
winter- there were icicles on his mustache six inches long. 
They 
3 
didn't have horses or wagons until they bought the farm. 
The farm was separated by Highway 50. 
In 1933 they moved the 
highway to where it is 'today behind the farm. 
The family was 
always known as the people who lived on the hill. 
They discuss food. 
The sausage was used in the older days and 
put in the tomato s:auces for spaghetti. 
Chicken or sausage was 
used in the sauce. 
The sausage was also fried 
 and eaten as it 
was. 
The other meats were eaten sliced --• 
ham prosciutto. 
Their 
hams were eaten after being cured a couple years. 
If they were 
eaten sooner, they cooked it first. 
Kerry talks about their father's Dodge truck: which was purchased 
in about 1925. 
He sold hams and vegetables travelling all over-
Carbon County. 
After he had the truck, he also sold vegetables 
from Green Fiver-. The children played games with the fruit, 
rolling peaches, etc., down hills. 
Their father also worked in 
the mines, but work: there was not regular, and you were lucky to 
get a couple days of work a week:. 
He worked in every mine in 
Carbon County to try to get enough work:. 
The food processing activates ended when the children married and 
left. 
Josephine and Paulmina were still at home, but there 
wasn't the need with the family so much smaller. 
It also ended 
when refrigerators were purchased and they could afford to buy 
butter and other items. 
When the milk: soured the pigs got it, but they rarely allowed 
anything to sour. 
Everyday in the morning vegetables were boiled to feed the pigs. 
This greatly affected the way the pork: tasted. 
It was much 
better than can be purchased today. 
The commercially processed 
food is not nearly as good as they used to produce themselves.

The Nicks lived on Charlie Saccomano's farm before they bought 
their family's farm. 
He and their father were good friends. 
They didn't compete as produce peddlers. 
They tell the story of the pigs getting drunk. 
When their father 
moved to Price, the first thing he did was to place a standing 
order for one ton of grapes from California 
 every Fall. 
He made 
his wine from them. 
He was a very good wine maker. 
Discusses 
the process of making wine. 
There was the first wine, which was 
the juice extracted from the fruit. 
The second wine was water 
with the mash to bring out juice left in the skin. 
The second 
was not as good as the first and used for everyday. 
He used his 
bare -feet to mash the grapes and had special barrels for the wine 
which was kept in a special place in the cellar. 
Little was 
wasted, so when all the juice was extracted from the last mash, 
he decided to feed it to the pigs. 
That night he heard a lot of 
noise and he thought it might be hobos so he tooF%- his gun. 
The 
pigs were in the pen, falling, and were drunk from the mash. 
He 
didn't give them any after that. 
Story about the saddest even that happened regarding wine. 
When 
Kerry's son, Johnny, was two years old, they lived across the 
road from her father. 
He took: Johnny every day to the cellar 
have a drink of wine. 
"A daily ritual." 
One day Johnny went on 
his own to the cellar and opened the Spout and it all spilled 
out. 
Her father never scolded him, but she felt he was probably 
very upset. 
They discuss the problems of wine making during prohibition. 
It 
left 
 a mar-E:: 
on Kerry because the police were down to her- father's 
house every week trying to catch him selling wine. 
They didn't 
really understand the law, or know about it. 
Her father was very 
I, 
scared because the Italians were prosecuted harder. 
She compares 
prejudice against blacks to what the 
they knew him they were difficult on 
got to know him, they loved him. 
He 
build the community. 
She thinks the 
the most was because they had heard how good his wine was and 
wanted it. 
He was very afraid because he thought they might be 
deported. 
When the law got to know him, they would come and 
drink wine with him, and he didn't have any more trouble. 
Distinction in the law between making wine for home use and not 
for sale. 
They said it came about because of the winery opening 
in St. George. 
Her father never sold wine, but gave it away. 
He 
made red and white wine. 
Muscatel grapes were used for the white 
wine. 
All of the grapes carne from California. 
He stopped making 
wine about 1955. 
As he got older he wasn't suppose to drink: 
wine, and her mother had to water down his glass of wine. 
None 
of them drink: wine now. 
Once in awhile her father got drunk:. 
Italians suffered. Before 
him, she says, but when they 
was responsible for helping 
law came after 
 her father 
When the family lived in Spring Glen, Mary made dandelion wine 
for her father. 
His wine-making began after they moved to their 
farm. 
Story about the pigs getting in the cellar. 
Spaghetti was 
purchased in nJ pound wooden boxes. 
Several boxes were bought at 
a time. 
One day the pigs got out of their fence and into the 
cellar. 
They destroyed what they didn't eat. 
Their mother was 
so upset and went to the railroad tracks to commit suicide. 
They 
had eaten all the bread too, and they were so dependent on that 
food store. 
Story about several women, friends of the family who came to 
visit. 
In 1927 their mother borrowed some money from Mary (her-
daughter) to pay the farm taxes. 
She put the money in a 
container in the cabinet. 
Sometime while the family was out 
helping to bake bread, the money disappeared. 
Their father 
wasn't working at the time and it was a tragedy. 
They were never 
sure which of the two visitors took: the money. 
Mary was married on February 20, 1927 and the tradition was that 
envelopes with money were given rather than gifts. 
It was an 
arranged wedding. 
Mary didn't meet John until just before she 
married him. 
He couldn't speak: English. 
There was a gathering 
at the house. 
Night came and she went to get her envelopes of 
money from the chest in the bedroom. 
Only a couple of envelopes 
were left,  all from one family. 
 
That family 
 had stolen all the 
rest. 
There was a lot of music at weddings, and food, and people ate 
and drank. 
All the music was Italian. 
The last Italian mandolin 
player died two years before. 
In his will he asked that the Nick 
Sisters sing at his funeral. 
It caused friction because he lived 
in Helper and musicians there thought they should sing. 
His name 
was Fete Aiello. 
He had played at Mary's wedding and he often 
played while the sisters sang. 
He was one of the oldest 
musicians in Carbon County. The Nick sisters sang at his funeral 
and sang all the old Italian songs - "Santa Lucia", "Oy Mari" 
"Marinariero." 
The songs played at weddings were "0 Sol Mio", "Marinariero," 
etc. 
The Nick sisters' father knew more classical music than the 
Italian music. 
He sang what Pavoratti. and Caruso sang. 
Caruso 
was his idol. 
Gal i 
corci was another of his favorite opera 
singers. 
When Joe Nick: was born, a chicken was killed as was the 
tradition. 
The chicken was used for chicken soup. 
The younger 
boys were there when their father caught the chicken and killed 
it. 
The soup was for the mother. 
The boys waited until their 
father went in to the house, and then they caught all the 
chickens in the barn and killed them. 
They thought they all had 
to be killed. 
It was a great loss. 
The family travelled from Spring Glen to Price in a covered 
wagon. 
"It must have been a sight." 
Story about a runaway wagon, the day Pac_ilmina was born. 
The 
buggy their- father owned was beautiful and had two sets of seats 
in it. 
When he came back from town, he parked beside the house. 
They had two dogs that hated each other. 
Both dogs went under 
the horse's legs to rest and started fighting. 
In the meantime, 
brother Joe who was 5 or 6 years old had crawled in the wagon on 
the seat. 
The horses took off and the road they were on led to 
the cemetery. 
It was a small cemetery. 
It was rumored that some 
of the robbers from the "hole in the wall gang" were buried 
there. EBuried treasure legend here] Their mother saw the horses 
take off, and dropped the baby she was holding, Paulmina, 
screaming. 
Everyone took: off after the horses. 
The horses had 
stopped alongside the cemetery fence. 
Joe was still sitting in 
the seat, happy. 
He said a man stopped his horses.

The church in Hiawatha, a small chapel, was one of the oldest in 
Carbon County. 
Later destroyed when Hiawatha depopulated. The 
statue of the blessed mother that was there was given to her 
neighbor, but :she wasn't much of a Catholic and she ended up 
giving it to Kerry because she admired it. Recently Kerry built a 
shrine for the statue in a corner of her home. 
[See slides] 
There are two blue roses on the shrine that were given to her by 
her children. 
They look: at a picture on Kerry's wall which is of the Lord in 
the garden of Gethsemane before his crucifiction. 
Story about 
the picture. 
Johnny, her son, was in the Navy and walking along 
the street and peddlers were selling these pictures and he 
purchased it. 
It was in his possession for thousands of miles 
before he gave it to her. 
He was so proud of that picture and it 
was known to the family that it was her prized possession. 
Nick:, 
her younger- son, was jealous of the attention she paid to the 
picture and purchased another one for his mother and she put it 
in a prominent place to give equal attention to the two pictures 
and thus to her two sons. 
Nick: was 17 years younger than Johnny.

RECORDED 6/20/90, BY STEVE SIPORIN 
Discuss Stella di America women's auxiliary lodge and a men's 
lodge that started in Castle Gate, around the turn of the 
century. 
Dr. Delpaz, a dentist, was president of the 
organization for 27 years. 
Al isn't very active but supports the 
lodge. 
Al's son, Joe, is active in the Italian Civic League in 
Salt Lake. 
Joe has a book that talks about the prominent people 
in the area historically and is interested in ethnic stuff. 
The lodge, a fraternal lodge, was created when the immigrants 
began coming to the area to help them become acquainted and it 
also helped support people when they were ill. 
Al says the 
official name is the National Columbian Federation. 
Frank Delpaz 
is the president now. 
Walter Borla is the secretary. 
The group 
meets in the city auditorium and is active in civic projects. 
Al was born in Sunnyside, Utah. 
His parents came from Catanzaro-
-San Giovanni in Fiore in Calabria. 
His mother came to the 
United States with Mrs. Salvani to Trinidad, Colorado, and lived 
in a boarding house. 
Al's father had been married before and had 
two boys. 
His wife was killed in a flood in Trinidad and was 
left with two small boys that Al's mother helped care for. 
Al's 
parents married and moved to Sunnyside. 
His father was a coke 
puller in the coke ovens. 
Describes the process of the coke oven 
in detail. 
His father was the night watchman at the coke oven 
and Al would sit with him sometimes. 
The puller pulled the coke 
out of the oven after it had cooked all night and would get it 
into the railroad car. 
The family then moved to Helper, and Al's father worked in the 
coal mines there, and then they moved to Price where his father 
retired. 
Father had garden, made wine, sausages. 
Al had 3 
sisters 
and 2 brothers in addition to his 2 step brothers. 
Al's mother's maiden name was Maio. 
Her brother, Pepino Maio had 
7 sons and many of her family lived near Trinidad. 
There were 
many stories about Pepino, though Al never met him. 
Al's 
mother's family was also from Calabria. 
Al's father told some stories about Italy that Al recalls. 
Father was disgusted that in America there weren't big 
celebrations. 
One story revolved around the parties that were 
given when there was a birth, even when the birth was to a donkey 
or to a family member. Gives dialect phrase inviting someone to 
celebrate the birth of a donkey. 
Al made sure he had parties 
when his son was born because of hearing his father tell this. 
Relates a story of how one of his father's brothers travelled to 
Ethiopia with a neighbor and died there. 
Another story about a 
man in Price--Potavio Silvani--who had supposedly killed a man in 
Italy and went to Ethiopia, and then to Utah. 
Killed an unwanted 
suitor of his sister. 
He lived with Veltri family. 
Was 
successful in Utah. 
Al doesn't recall any immigration stories about his parents. 
Suggest I interview Tony Priano. Al says the Italians have been 
too lazy to record their own stories. 
Discusses the Japanese people that lived near them. 
Al was 
fascinated with them when he was a child. 
He also enjoyed them 
when they would come to his store and mimics their expressions. 
Al says that when he was a child it seemed like Helper was a 
bigger place than Price, at least for the Italians. 
There was 
much more going on there for them. 
When they went to visit, his 
mother always took things to give people, but Al says they always 
came back with more. 
Helper was the hub for the Italians. 
Many 
fruit orchards. 
Italian music was played, Al recalls. 
In Mrs. John Bruno's 
basement there would be parties, with food and Dr. Albo's father 
made music. 
The kids danced the tarantella and adults threw 
money. 
Mandolin, accordion and guitar were played. 
The family 
came to Helper for the parties. 
Large parties were thrown for 
special occasions, like weddings, also. 
The ice cream was put in 
insulated bags with rock salt surrounding it. 
Al was a pharmacist in Helper. 
He also served on the city 
council. 
Helper used to have an archway and Al believes it was 
the one that is now in the city park. 
Discusses comare Angela a widowed midwife who baked bread and 
bootlegged. 
Al would go over there after school and she had him 
wash his hands and she would give him bread with plum jelly. 
"Every Italian had a plum tree." 
He remembers an iridescent soap 
she had that he liked. 
She kept track of the bread, etc., that 
people bought by notching a stick. 
Both she and the buyer would 
notch sticks and then when it came time to pay up they would 
compare sticks. 
Says he never knew what discrimination was because everybody 
helped take care of each other. 
In high school they couldn't 
date certain people because they were considered foreigners, but 
other than that never felt discrimination. 
Some Mormon, non-
3 
Mormon conflict. 
Because they were in control, there was some prejudice there by 
the Mormons. 
The northern Italians think they are better than 
the southerners and that was felt occasionally. 
Al says that 
when he first came to Helper there was a lot of Piedmontese and 
they kidded him about being Calabrese.

than the Piedmontese. 
Al says in Helper the Italians were 
predominantly Piedmontese, and that he used to be able to tell 
whether a sauce was made by a northerner or a southerner. 
Stories from the drug store: 
Mrs. Lupo and her husband didn't 
get along, and Al would cash her pension check for her and then 
get her the pharmaceuticals she needed. 
She would tell him to 
get her several things and say "Make it very cheap." 
(He 
imitates her dialect.) She was very independent. 
She and her 
husband fixed their own separate meals and were cold to each 
other. 
Piciarina ("Little one") was another customer of Al's. 
She wore 
brocaded dresses and had large breasts and was a joker around 
town. 
One day she said to Al, "Look at me, my skin is pink, my 
breasts are firm and supple." 
She talked about her age, and that 
she'd married an old man and said "the men are no good anymore, 
you have to lift them on and take them off and women have more 
trouble getting married the second or third time, you get in more 
trouble." 
Al says she was quite a legend. 
Story about the cat man: Aristedes Fabiati 
He had a degree in 
law and in engineering. He was a bachelor, and the kids called 
him the cat man because they said he ate cats. 
He was a 
character, intelligent, articulate. 
He often argued with the 
city.

violin and was a loner. 
Drank a lot. 
Many local legends about 
the cat man. 
He wore black clothes, a stovepipe black hat and 
black tie. 
Al loved his expression for the city officials: 
"malefactors of society." 
Al's brother-in-law, Eugene Falsetti was a stone mason. 
They 
were very close friends. 
He did the dugway wall in Sunnyside 
going toward Columbia. 
Bianco and Seppi were other stone masons 
in the area, who did work behind Veltri home--major retaining 
walls in Helper. 
Story about Mr. Seppi, during building of theater in Helper--
confusion of "basta" ("enough") with "bastard." 
Falsetti was an army clerk in Italy, and he had very nice 
handwriting. 
He was from Abruzzi. 
He brought his father to the 
United States also. 
Al describes his sister as being very large, 
but very happy, and Al appreciated how Falsetti never criticized 
her. 
He just passed away last year. 
He did masonry work and 
other handiwork. 
"I think everybody in Italy was some kind of a 
mason, weren't they?" 
Al talks about how everyone helped each other. 
He says half of 
the Italian culture was around killing pigs. 
Talks about 
butchering process in detail. 
Late in the fall the pig was taken 
out of the pen and laid on his side with a rope around his snout, 
and Al would stick the knife in to kill it. 
It was bled, and the 
pig was rolled on its side and gunny sacks put on the pig and 
scalding water was poured over it and the pig was then skinned. 
It was hoisted up and cut down the middle. 
The kids would get 
the bladder and blew it up. 
Al recalls it as a time of 
celebration; the kids played. 
Then the sausage was fixed and Al 
enjoyed the testing of the sausage. 
Al's son still makes the 
sausage and it is very good. 
He is an engineer. 
Al's wife is 
Greek, and so his son speaks Greek and wants to learn Italian. 
He also made wine. 
Al's son made wine with grapes they got from California and aged 
the wine in jugs. 
Al went up to participate in the bottling. 
It 
was a big party with Italian food and wine. 
[Break to get sample of wine.] 
Al continues drug store stories in dialect. 
Two men went into 
the store. 
One says I have the best insurance you can get, 
double in death [?]. 
If you die before you get killed you get 
$10,000. 
If you get killed before you die you get $20,000 -
that's double indem. 
That's the best insurance you can get. 
3 
(Catches just the end of an Italian joke.) 
Another immigrant 
says I don't like the United States, I'm going back to 
Springdale. 
Another character Al discusses is Pasquali Tuno. 
He used to go 
fishing and someone would ask "Did you catch any fish?" and he'd 
say "Oh my jeeze, There was so many fish, they was a-walking on 
the water." 
He would also say when walking through the marsh 
"Shhh, shhh, I think I hear footprints."

He puts on her 
form a big SP. 
The doctor examines the man and he puts SPP on 
his form. 
The man says "What does the SP and the SPP mean?" 
The

His father made good wine and gave 
much of it away.

never steal it, you can always have it. 
He also said don't drink 
it where you will be seen and you must have the responsibility to 
see someone drives home safely. 
Wine making was a ceremony in his family. 
They would drive to 
Sunnyside to the train depot where the grapes would arrive from 
California. Mainly Zinfandel. 
Then they loaded the grapes onto 
the wagon and took them home. 
The barrels were uncorked and 
prepared and taken downstairs. 
They each had a pair of white 
boots that they used to jump on the grapes. 
Then they were put 
in an open topped barrel and let to ferment and then it was 
drained. 
They made brandy from the squeezings, or they were 
given to the chickens that would get drunk on them. Kids brought 
grapes to their teachers. 
The grape boxes were used by the 
children to make scooters, and other toys. 
Father would have him 
taste lots of different wines. 
Al's father would speak to Al's wife in Italian and to him in 
English because he wanted her to learn Italian. 
She speaks 
Greek. 
Their son speaks Greek because he was around it more. 
Al's father was a janitor and he tells a story about not wanting 
to introduce a girl to him because he was afraid she would think 
poorly of him. 
Recalls feeling ashamed. 
He enjoys it that his 
sons kiss him still. 
"We're a kissin' family."

important to show your affection. 
He often kissed his mother 
when he was a child. 
His father was also very affectionate. 
It 
was a part of his family. 
Discussion of Al's godfather, Fortunato..

He was born in Grimaldi. 
He lived in Salt Lake and ran an importing house that Granato 
owns now. 
Discusses Granato's as a social center. 
Discusses folk medicine practices. 
One of the Domini brothers 
brought him a Greek medicine book and would ask Al to make him 
certain medicines from the book. 
They were the same as other 
medicines he made. 
Al's father said that before doctors, there 
was always somebody in the area that could make good mustard 
plasters. 
If someone got sick, they went after this person and 
brought him to the house and got him all the ingredients he 
needed. 
Al's father said if the person was strong enough he 
lived, if he wasn't he died and that's what we did. 
Sometimes 
someone would have a special ingredient for the mustard plaster. 
Mrs. Pignotto [?] was the midwife and she delivered babies up 
into the mid 1920s. 
They used to say they could tell there was a 
baby coming into the community because they would say it was up 
in the mine's powder house. 
Lots of belief in the evil eye. 
There was a family in town named Magliocco. 
Al talks about names 
and what they mean. 
Al says he flaunts his Italian heritage anytime he can. 
Some 
people who came into the pharmacy wanted him to speak English 
when there were others around and when they were alone they 
wanted to speak Italian. 
This irritated Al. 
He was proud of his 
parents and his heritage. 
He was never ashamed to bring people 
to his home, and his family fed their guests well. 
Al recalls that people always brought them food, walnuts, 
3 
raisins, hams, sausages, watermelons and all kinds of food. 
Would have lots of food at home--100 pound sack of raisins, 
apples, etc.
