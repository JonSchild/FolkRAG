I

Lo max f

He was s

down over h

against a

As Lo max r

muttered as he l
ooked a

Lo max r
eturned t

r
ecalled, "A mong t
he s

or me
 
was 'Home on t

t was t
he f

Lo max r

hat he had
 
captured t

he Negro
 
1
0 s
aloonkeeper had sung i
t
.
 
I
 
Dan Kelley, t
he man who wrote
 
t
he music t
o "Home on t
he Range."
 
About two years l
ater, i
n l
ate 1
910,
 
Lomax published a
 book called Cowboy
 
Songs and Other Frontier Ballads. I
t was a
 
3
26 page collection o
f 1
12 cowboy s
ongs t
hat
 
he had gathered.
 
I
ncluded i
n t
he book —the f
irst
 
edition i
s a
 collector's i
te m t
oday —were t
he
 
words and music t
o "Home on t
he Range."
 
Publication o
f t
he s
ong i
n Lomax's book
 
probably saved i
t
 f
ro m oblivion.
 
When Lomax's book was published,
 
t
he s
inging o
f cowboy s
ongs was beginning
 
t
o become popular, even i
n t
he East. But i
t
 
was not until 1
933 t
hat "Home on t
he
 
Range" beca me t
he vogue.
 
President Franklin Roosevelt i
s
 
credited with making t
he s
ong popular.
 
According t
o s
everal accounts, a
 group o
f
 
newspaper r
eporters sang "Ho me on t
he
 
Range" on Roosevelt's doorstep i
n New
 
York C
ity t
he n
ight he was f
irst e
lected
 
President. When Roosevelt heard t
he m, he
 
a
sked t
o hear t
he melody again. Then he
 
r
eportedly s
aid, "That's my f
avorite s
ong."
 
(More r
ecently a
 f
ew writers have c
lai med
 
t
hat Roosevelt r
eally d
isliked t
he s
ong.)
 
When t
he news spread, every s
inger
 
began i
ncluding "Home on t
he Range" i
n
 
h
is o
r her progra m. By early 1
934 nearly
 
every r
adio s
tation i
n t
he country was
 
p
laying t
he s
ong on t
he a
ir. Record
 
companies, music publishers —everyone
 
connected with t
he music business —were
 
making a
 k
illing o
ff "Home on t
he Range."
 
There were no r
oyalties t
o pay. The s
ong
 
was not copyrighted. The author was
 
unknown.
 
I
t was t
hen t
hat an Arizona couple —
 
Willia m and Mary Goodwin o
f Te mpe —
 
dropped a
 bombshell. I
n June 1
934, t
hey
 
brought suit i
n t
he United S
tates District
 
Court i
n New York C
ity against s
everal
 
music publishers, t
he radio networks,
 
moving p
icture producers and many
 
s
ingers who had sung t
he s
ong i
n public.
 
The Goodwins asked f
or $
500,000 i
n
 
da mages, a
lleging t
hey had written t
he
 
words and music t
o t
he s
ong under t
he t
itle
 
"An Arizona Ho me." The copyright, t
hey
 
said, had been r
egistered on February 2
7,
 
1
905. The r
ecords showed i
t
 was r
egistered.
 
Quickly music publishers pulled
 
"Ho me on t

ff
 
music s
tore s
helves. Recording companies
 
s
topped s
elling r
ecords o
f t

radio s

t
 
Moanfeldt f

a

about t

i

laim t
o
 
authorship.
 
As he was p
reparing t

Kansas f
or New York, Moanfeldt was a
sked
 
i
f
 he had enough evidence t
o win t
he c
ase.
 
"Enough," he a
sserted j
okingly,
 
"why I
 have everything but t
he quill t
he
 
s
ong was written with."
 
Moanfeldt and t
he Music Publishers
 
Protective Association d
id win t
he c
ase. But
 
i
t
 was 1
2 years before Kansans—using t
he
 
evidence uncovered by Moanfeldt—decided
 
t
o adopt "Home on t
he Range" a
s i
ts s
tate
 
s
ong. The Kansas Legislature made i
t
 
o
fficial i

But not a

ommercially minded c
ontended t
hat
 
t

ong "

Dear Friends:

Charles Wells had long considered what form Between The Lines would take after his
 
retirement, had discussed it at length with colleagues and with several experienced
 
editors who were interested in succeeding him.  But these plans were never consum-
mated because the discussions invariably came around to the conviction that with such
 
an unusual type of personal journalism, his successor should be free to establish his
 
own style and approach rather than be trained simply to follow the lead of a previous
 
editor.  All agreed that such an individual achievement could only be successfully
 
carried out independently by another individual free to work in his own way.
 
Charles Wells had had no warning, even after recent medical tests, that his heart
 
would suddenly give out.  Therefore, he had not completed his various explorations for
 
the future of Between The Lines. Yet he had often expressed the wish that it would
 
be carried on, that the readers of Between The Lines, whom he considered his friends,
 
would continue to receive what he had tried for so many years to bring them -
 some  
truth, some knowledge, some hope. Those of us who worked closely with him over the
 
years decided that his decision -
 that this unique News Service should be continued
 
as the independent individual work of one man -
 was the right one.
 
In remembering all that he had speculated about the future of Between The Lines, our
 
thinking led us to an editor and a publication that Charles Wells respected highly
 
and had often mentioned as having the same aims as those of Between The Lines.
 
The editor, Tristram Coffin, whose thinking closely paralleled that of Charles Wells,
 
and whose publication The Washington Spectator seemed most compatible with the
 
aspirations of Between The Lines. It is a coincidence that the suggestion of a merger
 
with The Washington Spectator also came from others in different areas a
s appropriate
 
for the future of Between The Lines.
 
In a memorandum outlining h
is own editorial philosophy, Tristram  'of f
in listed the
 
principles which guide him in his efforts to bring the significant facts and trends
 
before that minority of intelligent Americans who are the opinion-makers of our nation
 
the same readership which Between The Lines has served.  And the areas that Tristram
 
Coffin regularly covers are the same that for so long have f
illed the pages of
 
Between The Lines, -
 world peace, the environment, political integrity, the economy.
 
And above all, the need for men and nations to adapt to changing conditions, yet to
 
measure events and policies by the conscience of America and to bring a moral dimension
 
to interpretations of the news.
 
During his distinguished career as a journalist, Tristram Coffin has been a reporter,
 
city editor, political correspondent for the Indianapolis Times; assistant to director
 
Elmer Davis in the Office of. War Information; White House correspondent f
or CBS;
 
commentator for ABC; contributor to many magazines including Readers Digest, Nation,
 
New Republic, Nation's Business.  He has written seven books, including Missouri
  
Compromise, Not To The Swift, The Passion Of The Hawks (a study of militarism in

trivia that pours out of Washington.  After 30 years of reporting on the city's people,
 
institutions and patterns, he knows how to make the news about them taut, concise,
 
pungent, so that you don't have to waste time when you read about them.
 
He double-checks his facts with a network of confidential contacts whose trust he has
 
earned since the Roosevelt Administration.  Yet he has maintained this wide range of
 
contacts without becoming a manipulative tool or part of the journalistic Establishment.
 
He compares points of view, culls dozens of publications, from Le Monde to the
 
Manchester Guardian, from Tokyo's Syunkan Sinte to Der Spiegel.
 
Before writing a word, he reflects. Essential as this is to good critical reporting,
 
it is something few reporters have time to do.  He digs beneath the surface for the
 
vital issues that will touch our lives not only today, but in the months and years to come.
 
Tristram Coffin's readers include leaders in many fields of American thought and
 
achievement, such as Harvard's David Riesman; the New Republic's analyst "T.R.B.";
 
the Nation's editor Carey McWilliams; Ramsey Clark; Senators Humphrey, Kennedy, Dick
 
Clark, McGovern; radio commentator John Henry Faulk; movie maker Pare Lorentz;
 
Anthony Lewis of the N
.Y. Times; former Defense Secretary Clark M. Clifford; ex-chairman
 
of the Federal Reserve Board, Marriner S. Eccles; Benjamin V. Cohen; Gen. David N.
 
Shoup; Chairman Otis G. Pike of the House Intelligence Committee; John Kenneth Galbraith.
 
COMMENTS from Readers of The Washington Spectator
 
Bill Moyers: "You are a lonely but vital light from that bleak city."
 
I
.F. Stone: "You are doing a great job.  Keep it up."
 
Sen. Frank Church: "This is a note to say how much I enjoy and depend on The Washington
 
Spectator. It specializes in the unvarnished truth and in the economy of words which
 
slice to the heart of an issue.  That makes The Spectator a national resource in a
 
city that more often offers many words but few thoughts."
 
Kurt Vonnegut: "The Spectator is important to me. Such brave little four-pagers have
 
been magically influential over the past 30 years."
 
Erich Fromm: "Tris Coffin has proved to be a keen and incorruptible observer with a
 
capacity for hard work and the ability td gather relevant material which otherwise
 
would hardly find attention.  Besides that, he is a man with a penetrating insight into
 
what ails us, and with sincere faith in that human essential in America which, if it
 
manifests itself fully, may still save us from catastrophic developments."
 
Walter W. Heller: "I can see that your report on '
The Economy: Blueprint for Survival'
 
has a lot of food for thought.  And I intend to chew on it."
 
Sen. William Fulbright: "I have no hesitancy in recommending The Washington Spectator
  
to all those interested in a more humane and rational policy for our country.  Tris
 
Coffin's observations have been objective and penetrating, sensitive and foresighted.
 
His reports have provoked a good deal of serious consideration on the direction in which
 
America should be going."
 
Sen. James Abourezk: "I am pleased to learn that The Spectator will be expanding its
 
readership.  As you know, I have always enjoyed the perspectives taken by The Spectator 
and am glad to know more people will have an opportunity to read it."
 
Herman Wouk: "My comment on The Washington Spectator is that I
've just subscribed."

A Difference That Is Balanced Out
 
Each issue of Between The Lines has generally covered several different themes prominent
 
in the news at the time of the release.  By contrast, each issue of The Washington Spectator
 
focuses in more detail on one or two major themes.  This difference is balanced out by
 
the fact that The Spectator, over a period of months, will have covered a similar range
 
of subjects.
 
Here, for instance, are the topics covered in recent issues of The Washington Spectator:
 
Jimmy Carter's Stand On Issues, a study of his speeches and statements; The Class of '
7t  
what has happened to the freshman members of Congress;  Our  Changing World, New Life
 
Styles brought on by the depletion of resources;  Re-Styling The Fax Americana, a report
 
on the shift from Cold War to Resource Politics;  The Desert, America's Last Frontier;
 
The American Ethic, $
394 Billions worth, a study of the President's budget proposals;
 
Energy, Life without Exxon and Con Ed, alternatives to present energy sources;
 
The Economy, Blueprint for Survival; A Cold War Coup d
'Etat, an attempt by the
 
intelligence agencies to take control of U
.S. foreign and military policy; An Aborted
  
Middle East Peace Move, an untold story of John F
. Kennedy's move to bring peace to
 
the Middle East, aborted by his assassination;  The Path Ahead, Good Omens, a report
 
on grass roots ingenuity in solving problems.
 
And here are future topics planned for upcoming issues of The Washington Spectator:
 
The American Food Supply, changes in farming and their effects on the consumer;
 
Who's Getting Rich Off The Arms Race?; New Moves in The Middle East, an assessment of
 
the growing peace moves in Israel; Promises for Tomorrow, promising new developments
 
in energy; Need for A Federal Watchdog : —A National Ombudsman for Our Civil Liberties.
 
The Merger
 
From  the first discussions between our staff and the editor of The Washin ton Spectator,
 
Tristram Coffin, and the publisher, Ralph E
. Shikes, the suggestions for a merger with
 
Between The Lines seemed right.  The details have now been worked out, and we are pleased
 
to announce that Between The Lines will be combined with The Washington Spectator.
 
The 3-year-old Between The Lines has been published at the rate of $
S for 21 issues.
 
The l-year-old Washington Spectator is $10 for 24 issues -
 the difference because it
 
costs so much today to start a new publication.  However, despite the difference in cost,
 
the publisher of The Spectator has agreed to send just as many issues of the combined
 
publication as you would have received of Between The Lines. Of course, if you are
 
already a subscriber to The Spectator, please let The Spectator know and your subscription
 
will be extended accordingly.  We are pleased to have been able to make this arrangement
 
of even exchange of our $
5 subscription for The Spectator's $10 subscription and hope
 
that you will be too.
 
We enclose a copy of The Washington Spectator -
 which incorporates the Between The Lines
 
masthead.
 
With sadness and regret, we of the staff of Between The  
Lines lay down our
 
task because our editor is no longer with us, but it is with a feeling
 
of satisfaction that we pass on the aims and effort of Between The Lines
  
to a worthy and respected successor.
 
We thank you, in Charles Wells's name, for your interest, support and
 
concern for the things he believed in and for which he always worked.
 
Yours sincerely,
 
Mrs. Charles A. Wells

Dear Mrs. Duggan:
 
I saw your letter in the September/October 1985
 
issue of Alcalde and have been intending to write
 
since that time.
 My interest is in your father's
 
role as a publicist for the University.
 I have
 
found in the Archives (Barker Texas History Center
 
on the campus) early press bulletins attributed to
 
him when he was registrar, as early as 1899.
 1
 
have gone through his papers in the Barker Center
 
but have found no letters in which he discussed
 
his efforts to obtain press coverage of the
 
University's activities.
 I would be grateful if
 
you could share any such material you might have.
 
Let me explain my interest.
 For almost 34 years o 
I was associated with the University's News and
 
Information Service, retiring in January 1985 as
 
director of that office.
 I am attempting to
 
reconstruct the history of the University's press
 
relations, and your father seems to have pioneered
 
that area.
 Any additional light you can shed on
 
this aspect of his career will be greatly

T
HIS new book i
s the cul-
mination of half a century
 
o
f f
olk-song collecting and edit-
i
ng by the Lo maxes, father and
 
son, for i
t was i
n 1910 that
 
John  A.  Lo max,  the  father,
 
broke the t
rail for succeeding
 
collectors of A merican folk song
 
with a volu me of cowboy ha]-
l
ads.
 Appropriately
 enough,
 
Harvard College had a share
 
i
n  that  venture:  i
t  awarded
 
Lo max the Sheldon Fellowship
 
which enabled h
i m to do the
 
job.
 
Years  l
ater,  Lo max  repaid
 
part of h
is debt by bringing to
 
the college the l
iving fountain
 
of f
olk song he had d
iscovered
 
i
n the Louisiana Penitentiary,
 
Lead Belly. The Governor of the
 
s
tate had paroled the s
inger to
 
Mr. Lo max. To hear Lead Belly
 
he i
nvited Harvard's  eminent
 
scholar i
n folklore, George Ly-
man Kittredge, and so me l
esser
 
f
leas.  Lo max put a chair on
 
top of a desk in a roo m in
 
Emerson H a
il and f
ro m that
 
e
levation the b
ig, v
iolent, mag-
netic Lead Belly,  a two-ti me
 
murderer,  white  of  hair  and
 
b
lack of face, sang h
is songs,
 
acco mpanying  hi mself  on  a
 
huge twelve-string guitar.
 
"I'se  the  king  of  a
ll  the
 
twelv e
-string  guitar  players,"
 
he said, and we believed h
i m, as
 
we l
istened to that s
trong voice
 
s
inging h
is now fa mous song,
 
"
Irene," and watched h
i m beat
 
out s
ingle t
ime with one foot,
 
t
riple t
ime with the other.
 
That  scene  dra matized  the
 
c
lash of two opposing cultures.
 
I
t a
lso sy mbolized the s
trong
 
i
nterest i
n the salty and earthy
 
that has d
istinguished the Lo-
maxes as collectors and editors
 
Mr. Reynolds i
s a frequent
 
co mmentator on A merican bal-
l
ads and bajiad- makers.
 
of folk song, an i
nterest which
 
has  been  the  delight  of  a
ll
 
unregenerate l
overs o
f A meri-
can  song.  This  i
nterest  has
 
saved many a verse and song
 
f
ro m the puritanis m that see ms
 
t
o do minate those who supply
 
the funds f
or the journals and
 
publishing A merican folklore. I
t
 
carried the Lo maxes i
nto the
 
state penitentiaries of the South,
 
where they made many o
f their
 
most spectacular f
inds.
 
The  Lo maxes  have  a
lways
 
made their collections more for
 
the  general  public  than  the
 
scholarly world, that i
s one of
 
their d
istinctions as collectors
 
and editors, and this book i
s no
 
exception. I
t i
s this b
ias which
 
has i
nclined the m to the co m-
posite version of the folk song
 
in which they t
ake verses f
ro m
 
variants  collected  at  various
 
p
laces  and  at  various  t
imes,
 
even by various hands, and co m-
b
ine  the m  to  make  coherent
 
text. This practice i
s evident i
n
 
a
ll the Lo max collections:  "ar-
ranged" i
s a f
requent word i
n
 
the headnotes of this collection,
 
for i
nstance.  Another for m o
f
 
co mposite version takes words
 
f
ro m one p
lace and joins the m
 
to a tune f
ro m another. These
 
practices are f
rowned upon by
 
the  scholar  I
n  folklore,  who
 
wants pure t
exts f
or co mpara-
t
ive s
tudy.

ikes the co mposite version be-
cause i
t g
ives h
i m a s
ingable
 
song where  only a chip was
 
before.  He  h
i mself  does  the
 
sa me thing when he wants to
 
s
tretch out a f
rag ment he ad-
mires and the folk do so me-
thing of this sort, too, when
 
they take new words and put
 
the m to an o
ld tune, a very
 
com mon practice, or when they
 
take s
tanzas f
ro m various bal-
l
ads to make a new one, as i
n
 
the case of "Moonshiner."
 
I have l
eft for l
ast the r
ich
 
musical and social h
istory that
 
for ms the background f
or these
 
300-odd songs. He points out
 
the A merican t
endency to mix
 
and b
lend, which concocted thf
 
minstrel song out o
f the Negro
 
and Scottish-Irish t
raditions. He
 
argues that the s
tock of so-
called Child ballads collected i
n
 
A merica should be thought o
f
 
not so much as a re mnant as
 
a selection. In other words, he
 
believes  that  the  A merican
 
people re me mbered those songs
 
that ministered most to their
 
emotional needs. Thus "Barbara
 
Allen" i
s our most popular Eng-
l
ish and Scottish ballad because
 
i
t i
s  "frigid  western  woman
 
hu mbling  and  destroying  the
 
man who m she sees as her ene-
my and antagonist"
 
As  Mr.  Lo max  points  out,
 
other scholars have attributed
 
"Barbara Allen's" popularity to
 
i
ts nu merous printings in song-
books and broadsides. Another
 
probable cause of i
ts popularity
 
i
s i
ts l
ovely a
ir. Mr. Lo max well
 
may be r
ight, at l
east i
n part.
 
Certainly some of the l
ove songs
 
i
n this book see m to accent the
 
l
imitations  of  the  A merican
 
f
rontier male as l
over. In "How
 
Old Are You, My Pretty Little
 
Miss?"  the 16-year-old young
 
l
ady c
lai ms she "can court more
 
i
n a minute and a half" than
 
her suitor "can i
n an hour," and
 
when the Johnson boys went
 
courting the s
ight of a pretty
 
g
irl made them afraid and "
they
 
d
idn't know where to put their
 
feet."
 
For the reader here i
s a fas-
c
inating s
tudy of the fantasies
 
and actions of his ancestors i
n
 
action, a pungent folk h
istory
 
of the United States.  For the
 
s
inger, here are p
iano acco mpa-
n
i ments or guitar chords for a
ll
 
the songs. For the scholar, here
 
are headnotes with cross refer-
ences.  Gathered  mostly  f
ro m
 
the Lo max collections and t
'iose
 
of their f
ellow-collectors, this i
s
 
perhaps the fullest, most rep-
resentative and best edited pop-

These are great pictures and are exactly what I need for the TFS
 
history, but I cannot get a decent reproduction from a browntone picture.
 
Would you have Reeves print simple black-and-white pictures and not mat
 
them or back them.
 Get him to send the negatives, if you can.  My repro
 
man here provides both print and negative.  Also tell him that the pictures
 
will be reproduced in a book; that is, they will be shot again, so they
 
need to be sharp, not soft prints.
 
Do you have the date of this picture?  I have a picture of him in
 
1
902 and he is obviously older in your pictures.
 
I appreciate your help very much.  Your father was the Society's
 
beginning and we honor him.

- 
Hudie Ledbetter tuned h
is twelve-
s
tring guitar. His grayed head bent
 
l
ow over the i
nstru ment.  His h
igh
 
cheek bones had ebony g
lints.
 
This  was  i
n  Hudie Ledbetter's
 
yellow-walled  f
lat  i
n  East Ninth
 
S
treet,
 near  Avenue  B.
 The
 
"knifin' man" f
ro m Caddo Parish
 
i
n  Louisiana was  r
ehearsing  f
or
 
Sunday n
lght
.
 
The wo man on the soiled couch
 
shielded her eyes f
ro m the uncov-
e
red e
lectric l
ight.
 
She said:  "Hudle's t
o p
lay h
is
 
guitar, come Sunday, at the benefit
 
i
n the Forrest Theatre.  I
t's f
or the
 
Dusk Bowl r
efugees.  The Okie."
 
Hudie Ledbetter, i
f you r
ecall, I
 
the Negro who twice got out o
f the
 
j
ail house through r
ecordings of h
is
 
music.
 
He p
lays ballads, mostly,; narra-
t
ive poems.  He r
ecites the m and
 
s
ings  then  t
o  h
is guit a
r
. music.
 
Someti mes he talks parts, s
ings the
 
r
est.
 
At l
ast Hudle Ledbetter had t
he
 
guitar  tuned.
 His  dark  f
ingers
 
moved up and down the s
trings and
 
h
is p
ick p
lucked out a s
teady tune,
 
c
rude, pri mitive s
tuff.  Made your
 
f
eet shuffle.
 
He said: "Before I came t
o New
 
York City they t
ol' me N w York
 
City  built  on, a great b
ig rock.
 
Thas t
he r
eason I
 written this song
 
about Ne w York."
 
The p
lunking sounds gave rhyth m
 
t
o t
his s
imple i
ntrodijction.
 
The words were whiney, but they
 
had cadence.  They were o
ld h
illy-
b
illy, maybe voodoo. Hudie Ledbet-
t
er's eyes, marble gray where most
 
men's eyes are white, f
ixed on the
 
gri my yellow wall.
 
"They said," he mur mured, "that
 
I
n New York City, dawn under the
 
groun', the subway was out r
ight
 
through solid rock. I
 d
idn't believe,
 
but when I gotten here i
t was so."
 
This was s
till t
alking i
ntroduc-
t
ion. Still the p
ick evoked musical
 
shadows. They s
tayed hard on the
 
heels o
f the p
layer's words.
 
Mouth  barely  open,  the  Caddo
 
Parish minstrel mur mured: "They
 
say I the onliest man ever made a
 
song about New Yawk City.  The
 
onliest c
ity ever built on a rock."
 
Hudie Ledbetter's head rolled and
 
the ebony h
ighlights changed.  He
 
s
ee med a man entranced. His voice
 
t
ook  on  r
ich  s
ing-song.  I
t  was
 
exultant, l
ike so me one shouting t
o
 
wake echoes i
n deep woods.
 
This was the song:
 
"It's one thing, f
olks, I ask you
 
t
o do.
 
"Catch a bus an' r
ide up Fifth
 
Av-en-oo.
 
"When you r
ide that bus, get i
t on
 
yo' mind
 
"Because i
t sho' I
s gonna cost you
 
a d
i me."
 
He s
tru m med and hum med a
 brief
 
musical i
nterlude. Gray marble eyes
 
on the ceiling now. His yellow shoes
 
beat out the t
ime.
 
"Now, when i
t get c
loudy an' l
ook
 
l
ike rain
 
"You s
tep downstairs, catch you a
 
subway t
rain.
 
"Expresses t
rains runs under the
 
groun';
 
"They won't keep s
till; yoxi,
 gotta
 
ketch yo' t
rain.
 
"You gotta r
ide t
o Sugar Hill
 
"In Ne w York City."
 
C
lu mp and t
hu mp with the yellow
 
shoes, Hudie Ledbetter's s
tare went
 
over  your  head.  His  exultation
 
spread
 The guitar a
ll but l
eaped
 
f
ro m h
is f
ingers and h
is voice went
 
h
igher.
 
He s
tru mmed and  tapped,  and
 
then went on:
 
"When you get to the Eas' S
ide
 
"You s
ee's a 'B' s
ettin' up there.
 
"When you get on t
he Wee' S
ide
 
"You s
ee a great b
ig double-you,
 
"An' that means Wee'
 
"An' you know the r
es'
 
"Ill New
. York City."
 
The minstrel's voice s
oared. This
 
was the' s
tuff the f
olk-song experts
 
t
old about.  Music and a musical
 
s
tyle rooted way back i
n antiquity
 
—the narrative tune of t
he g
leeman,
 
of the j
ongleur and t
he c
oop.
 
The. l
ast f
ew verses, were hoarse
 
boasts, sung at t
op r
egister. Hudie
 
Ledbetter's eyes had the g
lint o
f
 
polished onyx as he sang
, them:
 
"I go down t
o Lou'siana
 
"An' I
'll walk and I
'll t
alk,
 
"Tell ever'body '
bout C
i
ty o
f New
 
Yawk!"
 
The yellow shoes pounded and the
 
guitar whanged.
 
"An' I go down to Georgia
 
"An' I
'll walk an' t
ell
 
"Trains run over t
op o
' t
own hyar
 
"And I
t's call-ed the El."
 
Thu mp!  Clu mp!  Yellow  shoes
 
kept a
-patting.
 
"An'  have  yo'  heard  about  the
 
might-ce shock?
 
"THEY TELL M E NE W YA W K
 
CITY
 
"BUILT ON SOLID ROCK!"
 
Hudie Ledbetter r
ested h
is guitar
 
on brown-suited knees.  His sharp
 
face had a dozen dewy h
ighlights
 
now.
 
He said, "Tha's the onliest song
 
about New York City that i
s built
 
on a solid rock."

'  FIDDL R  CA S
 
Fiddlers, fiddlers, fiddlers three,
 
The pape,the m nin , the little ba-bee;
 
We live in the sand at the edge of the sea-
Pollyp and rillyp and little Peejee.
 
What do we do when the waves run high?
 
V
/hat do we do when the ea-birds cry?
 
What do we do when the wind blows strong?
 
We cuddle together and sing our s
ongs
 
Fiddlers, fiddlers, fiddlers three,
 
The papa,the mamma, the little b
a-bee;
 
We live in the sand at the edge of the sea,
 
The very best home for the fi:ldiere three.
 
Way down deep i
n the s
andman's home,
 
Safe from the breakers and hissing fum,
 
e tuck our fiddles down under our ciins,
 
And there in the darkness the music begine
 
Fiddlers, fiddlers, fiddlers three,
 
The papa, the mamma l the little ba-bee,
 
We live in a
. hole at the rim of the s
ea,
 
A c
ozy retreat for the fiddlers three.
 
V
ihe n the sea grows ca]
.zn and the winds blow sweet,
 
When the sand is warm t
o our tripping feet,
 
With fiddles in hand and bows held tight,
 
We fiddle and dance in the pale moon1i ht:
 
Fiddlere,fiddlers, fiddlers three,
 
The papa, the mamma, the little bu-bee,
 
There are no crabs s
o happy as we-
Pollyp and Pillyp and little Peejee.
