in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at lk"ashington, D.C. 
In presenting this volume of my songs to the public, I 
desire to express my thanks for their very generous support, 
and hope that I 
may continue to please in the future, as in 
the past. 
Encouraged by the kind applause of an amusement-
loving public, I 
will put forth renewed efforts to please, and 
merit their approbation, with a 
constant supply of my own 
original productions. 
How my efforts have pleased hereto-
fore has been well attested in all the principal cities of the 
United States: their future reception I 
will leave with my 
friends, which, I 
trust, includes everybody. 
Respectfully Yours, 
BONNIE RUNNELLS.

And the army of starvation is at hand.

And worked in a

Then give three cheers for the happy German race, 
They will stick to their country and never cause disgrace. 
The honest- hearted German can meet you face to face, 
There the candidates were wanting in our land. 
Ladies and gendlemens, don't be too sympathetic. 
Remember that the Germans are Republican and Democratic. 
Send your husbands out, oh ladies do now, don't forget it, 
To vote for General I>mchy, he's on hand.

And this year we hope to the White House he'll be sent.

Parody on Little Widow Dunn. 
Written by BONNIE RUNNELLS, and sung by the friend of the working man, 
HON. JOHN REILLY, who stands without fear whenever he does appear. 
I've got a 
crazy daughter, she's foolish in her head ; 
She never minds me in anything I 
say. 
She's always reading song books, never goes to bed, 
For her schooling every month I 
have to pay. 
She's stuck on the profession—on actors she is mashed— 
She's crazy for to work in Harry Hill's. 
She has challenged Murphy and Rowell to win O'Leary's belt, 
She is the laughing stock for all the gills. 
CHORUS. 
Eileen banana, sweet Louisiana, 
Slobbery days, baby mine. 
Flaherty's frisky from drinking whiskey, 
What an education has Miss Rubenstein. 
I 
sent her to the country to benefit her health, 
For the people on our block are mighty glad. 
Ever since she's been away she's never been herself, 
And the folks they say she's raving staving mad. 
She walks the streets barefooted, wears her sister's clothes, 
Rings the door bells on our block each day; 
She's milking all the chickens, feeding corn to cows, 
And scares the people when they hear her say— 
Eileen banana, & c. 
Sheeny Baby Mine. 
Sung by HEN GRAHAM with great sneeesq. 
My name is Solomon Moses, 
In my mind, my mind, 
I 
sell the very finest clothes, 
in my mind, in my mind, 
I 
sell the cheapest pair of pants, 
They will fit your uncles or your aunts, 
Now is the time you've got the chance, 
In your mind, in your mind, 
Now is the time you've got the chance, 
In your mind. 
I 
sell a 
suit of clothes for three dollars, 
In my mind, in my mind, 
For chromos I 
give away paper collars, 
In my mind, in my mind, 
I 
keep the finest clothing store, 
Number 4-11-44, 
My name is painted on the door, 
In my mind, in my mind, 
My name is painted on the door,

Sheeneys' Masquerade.

Treat :licce:s by H ENIZY GRAHANi. 
Solomon Isaacs keeps a 
pawnshop 
With his other brother Mose. 
Oh, he fell in love with a 
sheeney gal, 
Blind in one eye and a 
crooked nose. 
Next week they are to be married, 
And his wife will wear his pants: 
lie has invited all the sheeneys 
To come to the wedding and have a 
dance. 
('11aRv. 
For there was Sheency Toe, the tailor, 
With his twenty shilling pants, 
..-\nd Solomon Jacobs' sisters, 
his seventeen cousins and fifty aunts. 
Big Isaac Cohen, the glazier, 
Of the matzcrs was not afraid ; 
They danced the Harlem waltz all night 
At the sheeneys' masquerade. 
They had lots of German whisky, 
French and Irish lager beer. 
They had peanuts and bananas— 
Moons and ice cream was too dear. 
They had bootjack pie and doughnuts, 
Pulverized matzers on a 
stick ; 
The custard sour and corn beef cake 
Made all the sheeneys sick. 
For there was, & c, 
At ten o'clock the\ commenced to dance 
Some German highland flings, 
When little Rachel Isaacs 
Went and cut all the fiddle strings. 
They all put on their hats and coats. 
And with Solomon had a

The police came in to stop it, 
And locked the sheeneys up all night. 
For there was, Sze. 
The German Rifle Team. 
Sung by GRAHAM & JONES with great success. 
Don't you see you just came out 
From Germany we all the way, 
We go shoot down on Creedmoor, 
On a 
lot far disdent day. 
We will show America 
Some shooting what they never seen, 
For we are known all over the wont, 
As the German Rifle Team. 
C 
non es. 
Forward march, stiff as starch, 
Don't you think that awful fine, 
Now we start, ain't that smart, 
One by one we form a 
line; 
Schneider's band play so grand, 
Of course that music it ain't me, 
Whoop- a-la, we shout hurrah, 
For the German Rifle Team. 
We are composed of Dutchmen, 
Who every one is a 
cracked shot, 
Und yen we see the bull's eye out, 
We always shoot dem on the spot. 
We use the German cartridges 
To blow away the target clean, 
Do look out when we're about, 
For we're the German Rifle Team. 
We can make the biggest score 
Of misses every time we shoot, 
We presist from all over the won't, 
And so we think we'll surely suit. 
At one hundred thousand yards 
We never fail to miss the mark, 
Every one of us can shoot, 
Or light a 
candle in the dark.

Beckey Gildersleeve. 
Written by CHAS. SANDER.S. Sung by GRAHAH & JONES with great auceega. 
Sweet was the girl I 
met last Sunday 
While walking through the park to take the evening air, 
She smiled when I 
passed her, 
My heart went with her, 
I 
knew that I 
had won 
This little Deitcher girl so fair, ( Break.) 
Oh, she sent me a note ( Break.) 
On which was wrote— 
Her name was Beekey Gildersleeve, 
Her fader he was rich, 
tier mutter keeps a 
bier serloou 
Behind McCoomb's Ditch, 
I 
am going to meet this German girl 
Next Sunday afternoon, 
I'll treat her to a 
dozen bier's, 
And catch her very soon. 
I'll put on me Sunday clothes 
And won't I 
look gallus, 
With my swallow-
tail coat, 
Double-breasted in the back, 
I'll pay live cents on- the steam locomotive 
And to her house I'll ride on the railroad track ; 
I 
expect there will be a baud, (Break.) 
At the depot when I 
land. 
To escort me to my Beckey's house, 
Und then her folks will see, 
Or else a 
half a 
dozen clubs 
Be waiting there for me. 
And if I 
don't get her consent, 
I 
know I 
turn a 
loon, 
And cut my throat with it bar of soap; 
That will end me very soon.

AM a 
jolly Dutchman, 
From Yarmany I 
came, 
And if you wants to find me out, 
Fritz Donderbeck's my name. 
The reason I 
came of this place, 
Is to told you of a 
spree 
Vot happened to a 
fellow called Ha, 
And an another one—dots me. 
Hans and his gal was married, oh, 
bet you five dollars dat was so, 
And all dem fellows from down below, 
Come right away quick to the spree, 
There was Gotleb and Mike, 
And Wigenstein and crazy Ike, 
There was big nose Jake, the fool, 
And Openhehner and me: 
Openheimer he got drunk, 
And come down on his head ker.plunk, 
Just as Gotieb got him on his knees, 
They both fell down in a 
plate of Dutch chew, 
Hoop in, set 'em up again, 
Knock ' ern down again. 
Set 'em up again, 
Donder yedder, set em up again. 
Drunken Dutchmen was wet 
Is because she likes benzine. 
She has a 
gum bile on her now, 
And a 
bunion on her ear, 
And a 
moud so big, I 
take my oath, 
She can swallow a 
keg of beer. 
Oh, I 
tell you, she's a 
hunky gal, 
A hunky gal, a

I 
tell you she's a 
hunky 
And she's going to marry me. 
I 
invite you all to come and see my Katerisiso 
Don't stay, for we expect you all to see. 
Katerine can easy be found, 
For she only weigh three hundred pound. 
Oh, don't you wish dot you was me,

And other things which was immense, 
Here's a

A receipt for blowing bladders, 
All the lot I'll give to you 
For only seven cents. 
When its cold, I'm always freezing, 
Selling things is very teasing, 
When it rains I'm always wet,

THE WATERMILL. 
As recited by Gus W ILLIAMS, at the Olympic Theatre. 
Listen to the watermill, through the livelong day, 
How the clicking of its wheel wears the hours away, 
Languidly the autumn wind stirs the greenwood leaves, 
From the fields the reapers sing, binding up the sheaves; 
And a 
proverb haunts my mind, as a 
spell is cast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Autumn winds revive no more leaves that once are shed, 
And , lie sickle cannot reap corn once gathered; 
And the rippling stream flows on, tranquil, deep and still, 
Never gliding back again to the watermill. 
Truly speaks the proverb old, witk a 
meaning vast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Take the lesson to thyself, loving heart and true, 
Golden years are fleeting by, youth is passing, too; 
Learn to make the most of life, lose no happy day, 
Time will never bring thee back chances swept away. 
Leave no tender word unsaid, love, while love shall last— 
Tbe mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Work while yet the daylight shines, man of strength and will. 
Never does the streamlet glide useless by the mill; 
Wait not till to-morrow's sun beams upon the way, 
All that thou canst call thine own lies in thy— to- day, 
Power, intellect and health may not always last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh I 
the wasted hours of life that have drifted by, 
Oh I 
the good we might have done, lost without a 
sigh! 
Love that we might once have saved by a 
single word, 
Thoughts conceived, but never penned, perishing unheard, 
Take the proverb to thine heart, take and hold it fast— 
file mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh love thy God and fellow-man, thyself consider last, 
For come it will, when thou must scan dark errors of the past; 
And when the fight of life is o'er, and earth recedes from view, 
And Heaven in all its glory shines, 'midst the pure, the good 
the true. 
Then you'll see more clearly the proverb deep and vast— 
The mill wirl never grind with the water that is past,

And if you.

It's about a

And me they always teaze; 
And if I

From the cellar they steal my geese.

Where was Solomon Isaacs when the loafers stole the geese? 
Where was Solomon Isaacs when the loafers stole the geese? 
'What was be about when they cracked him in the snout ? 
Where was Solomon Isaacs when the loafers stole the geese? 
They kicked me all around the place, 
Until my head was sore ; 
They wasn't satisfied with that, 
They want to give me more. 
My wife went almost crazy then 
From hollering out " Police ! 
There goes a 
gang of robbers there. 
They stole my husband's geese!" 
Where was Solomon Isaacs, &e. 
To the court next day I 
went, 
My wife Rachel and I.

A

And they always steel my geese."

at table on chair. 
Low stool, Kitty sitting down on stool. 
KITTY— Oh, father, hurry up and eat your supper, and 
don't be growling there all night.

KITTY—You will not ! what, never swear again ? 
FATHER— No, never in all my life ! 
KITTY—What, never? 
FATHER—Well, hardly— 
(Fritz enters through door R., and before he finishes the sen-
tence hits him with a 
wind bladder on the head, and chases 
him all around the room until the old man is exhausted. 
Fritz leaves the room, and returns shortly after with a 
big 
cow bell, and rings violently; excites the old man. 
Both 
have a 
quarrel, and Kitty pleadingly steps between and begs 
for peace and quietness, which she obtains.) 
FRITZ— Well, Mr. McNamara O'Donnell, how do you feel 
after dot liddle exebition of Pinifive?

FATHER—What's that you called me, you auld Dutch ras-
cal of de divel ! 
Don't ever attempt to call me that again, or 
I'll kick the daylights out of you. 
Do you hear that, auld 
Fritz Van Winkle? 
Ha, ha, ye're the chip off the auld block. 
'Twas no harm to call you Fritz, you well deserve the name. 
FRITZ—Well, Mr. Mc. O'Donnell, you must oxcuse me for 
using that name. I 
speake me not much good de Irish lang-
uge, and when St. Patrick's Day comes, widout regard to 
klick klu klux, I 
will marry Kitty for sure. 
Ain'd dot so, 
Kitty? 
KITTY—Yes, Fritz, that is so. 
FATHER—Look here, Dutch, you see-see-see—Man over-
board ! 
I 
swallowed the cud of tobacco, and it's resting on 
my left lung ! Hould up now, I'm all right again. You made 
a 
terrible mistake. 
You said klick klu klux, when you should 
have stepped forward like hunchback McCarthy, and cry out: 
Widout regard to clique or clan, 
I 
am Muldoon the solid man, 
Hurrah for the Queen, God save us all. 
KITTY— Father, you will have to pardon me for keeping it 
a 
secret, you see I 
am -;•oing to get married to Fritz, and 
we will be happy all the days of our life. 
FATHER (coaxingly)—Will you ask the young gintlemaA to 
have a drink, Kitty, I am sure be needs something . to 
strengthen his nerves. 
KITTY—He never drinks any strong liquor, father, so don't 
you offer him any. 
FATHEa—Is that so, he looks pale, I 
think a 
little soothing 
-;yrup or some of Railway's Ready Relief would do him good; 
don't you think so, Kitty? 
KITTY— Never mind, father; the wedding comes off to-
morrow, and Fritz will now sing his favorite song, " The 
Shamrock,"

FRITZ (sings as follows)— 
THE SHAMROCK. 
Through Erin's Isle, 
To sport awhile, 
As Love and Valor wander'd 
With Wit, the sprite, 
Whose quiver bright, 
A thousand arrows squandeed: 
Where'er they pass, 
A 
triple grass 
Shoots up with dew drops streaming, 
As softly green 
As Emeralds, seen 
Through purest crystal gleaming. 
Oh, the Shamrock, the green, immortal Shamrock 
Chosen leaf 
Of bard and chief, 
Old Erin's native Shamrock. 
Says Valor, " See, 
They spring for me, 
Those leafy gems of morning !" 
Says Love, " No, no, 
For me they grow, 
My fragrant path adorning !" 
But Wit perceives 
The triple leaves, 
And cries, " Oh ! do not sever. 
A type that blends, 
Three godlike friends, 
Love, Valor, Wit, forever !" 
Oh, the Shamrock, the green, immortal Shamrock 
Chosen leaf 
Of bard and chief, 
Old Erin's native Shamrock

FATHER—Well, Fritz, (shaking his hand) ye're my friend, 
and my (laughter belongs to you, so now join hands, and be 
happy for the rest of yer lives ; and see here, Kitty, what 
have you got to say about yerself? 
KITTY (sings)— 
I 
love Fritzy, I 
love Fritzy, 
And my Fritzy he loves me, 
We eat cabbage in our cottage, 
And he's all this world to me. 
FRITZ (
sings)— 
I 
love Kitty, I 
love Kitty, 
And my Kitty she loves me, 
She's my darling little treasure, 
And in Ireland we will stay. 
FATHER (sings)— 
They're as happy as can be, 
In the winter nights when Jack Frost he bites, 
And they'll sing and dance for ye. 
They will make yer faces smile, 
Oh, they are a 
fine odd couple, 
And with me you will agree, 
They are awful mighty clever, 
And are full of merry glee. 
FRITZ—Veil, father, I 
hope you will give us your blessing, 
and pray that we may always be able to look on the bright 
side, and when the enemy comes down on us too hard, father, 
and when you are dead and gone I 
will see tlir.t you are 
buried in a 
Jews' burying ground, for that is the last blace the 
devil will ever go to look for an Irishman. 
(A great noise is heard outside; great excitement all around; 
soldiers, sailors, farmers and milkmaids all come in ; the 
music plays an Irish hornpipe, and all hands take par* 
in the dance, after which scene closes.)

The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of pleying is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing.

courting. Cards.—This Serieh of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in encei 0, way as to be non-cosimittal. 
Many young ladies are visited by 
etlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unl
adyli ke encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which inif.rht have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The seetiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted he the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. 
The playine of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

HUMPTY DIIMPTY5 
IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
It is a Fac simile of a Trick practiced by all 
the Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Bead what a leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order 
has been sent us, called H IIMPIT D IIMPTY, 1 and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear-
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed,. 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. 
A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at home in the hand-
ling of it. "—Phila. Evening Bulletin.
