LITTLE MAUD. 
Oh ! where is our dainty, our darling— 
The daintiest darling of all ? 
011! where is the voice on the stairway ? 
Oh ! 
where is the voice in the hall ? 
The little short steps on the entry, 
The silvery laugh in the hall ? 
Oh ! where is our dainty, our darling— 
The daintiest da.rling of all? 
CHORUS. 
Little Maud, Little Maud! 
Oh ! the daintiest darling of all— 
Little Maud, Little Maud ! 
Oh ! the daintiest darling of all ! 
The peaches are ripe in the garden, 
The apricots ready to fall : 
The blue grapes are dripping their honey 
In sunshine upon the white wall : 
Oh ! where are the lips full of melting. 
That looked up so pouting and red, 
When we dangled the sun-purpled bunches 
Of Isabells over her head ? 
0 Maud, little Maud ! say where are you ? 
She never replies to our call— 
Oh ! where is our dainty, our darling— 
The daintiest darling of all ? 
CHORUS. 
Fare thee well then dainty darling little Maud, tare thee 
well! 
Oh ! the daintiest darling of all— 
In heaven we shall meet thee, dearest darling little Maud— 
Oh! the daintiest darling of all ! 
WHEN THE BAND BEGINS TO PLAY. 
Written and composed by G. W . 
H UNT. 
I'm very fond of music— to me its quite a 
treat, 
'Unless it be from German Bands, or Organs in the street. 
Thro' list'uing to a 
band o•ie day, I 
fairly lost my heart 
The leader ' twas who found it and he now with it won't part. 
C110 
Oh 1 
I 
feel so awfully jolly when the baud begins to play, 
When the band begins to play, when the band begins to play, 
I'm very fond of music, I 
could listen all the day, 
Especially when my Chatlie leads the band—PoIn, Porn. 
My Charlie is my darling—the beau ideal of loves, 
With his hair so black and curly, and his whitest of white gloves. 
My love stands in the middle, whit his baton in his hand, 
Aal leads the instrumentalists in a 
style that I 
think grand. 
Oh 1 
I 
feel so awfully jolly when the band begins to play, 
They play such jolly music—waltz, polka, and quadrille, 
And somethues play go feelingly, it gives me a 
quite tin-ill, 
The leader sometimes gives a 
frown, and looks as though he's rash; 
And then they play so soft and sweet, and after comes a 
(
Task, 
Oh I 
I 
feel so awfully jolly when the band begins to play, 6:c. 
Now, Where my Charlie's to be-seen, I 
don't intend to tell, 
For fear that he might captivate some other belle as well. 
He's asked me " one small•question,"—I gave him my reply— 
In about-a 
month there will not be a 
happier wife than I. 
Oh I 
I 
feel so awfully jolly when the band begins to play, fizz_

As I

Tiny feet th.lit travelled lightly 
In this weary IVoild of woe— 
Now silent lie in yonder church-yard,

Little foot-steps, soft and gentle,

How I

As I

She sleeps the sleep that knows no waking, 
By the golden river's shore: 
And my heart it yearns with sadness, 
When I 
pass that cottage door— 
Sweetly now the angels carol, 
Tidings from our loved ones far, 
That she still does hover o'er us, 
And will be our guiding star. 
She sleeps the sleep that knows no waking, 
By the golden river's shore : 
And my heart it yearns with sadness, 
When I 
pass that cottage door.

In the world of sin no more, 
Ne'er they'll press the sand-banks lightly 
By the golden river's shore—

Try to smoothie your troubles o'er--
For I'll think of her as sleeping. 
Not as dead, but gone before. 
Little foot-steps now will journey 
In the xvorld of sin no more, 
Ne'er they'll pressi the sand-banks lightly 
By the golden river's shore—

THE STRAIGHT TIP. 
Music at Bousey & Co., No. 4 
Bond Street, New York. 
I'm a 
downy sort of chap. 
You'll see beyond all doubt ; 
Up to every move on the board— 
I 
know my way about. 
All information you may want, 
You'll have it front these lips; 
Make no blooming error there— 
For, mine are all straight tips_ 
CHORUS. 
The straight tip, the straight tip, 
I 
give you the straight tip ; 
Make no blooming error there, 
I 
give you the straight tip. 
When courting, if you'd like to make 
The lady' your fair bride; 
Get to know her character, 
Before the knot is. tied_ 
Or you may perhaps regret it, 
When your cable you cnn't slip; 
Make no blooming error there. 
I 
give you the straight tip. 
The straight, dm. 
When going- to the Races, if 
On betting you're inclined ; 
Be sure yon never bet upon 
The horse that. cones behind. 
Your coin away will slip— 
Make no blooming error there., 
I 
give you the straight tip. 
The straight. am. 
When driving a 
hard bargain— 
Now always think of this— 
. 
Be sure you have the best of it, 
A 
good chance never miss. 
For, in this world all seem inclined 
Each other's coin to grip— 
Make no blooming error there, 
I 
give you the straight tip. 
The straight, dm. 
A 
tip I've got for fighting, 
Which is useful you will say; 
That is, to never let your man 
flit you in any way. 
Keep your guard, and now and then, 
Aim at the nose or lip— 
Make no blooming error there, 
I 
give you the straight tip. 
The straight, ttc. 
Never be too certain, boys, 
In what you undertake ; 
Or ten to one but things go wrong, 
You make some sad mistake. 
For, many a 
slip, you know, there ig 
Between the cup and lip— 
Make no blooming ei ror there, 
I 
give you the straight tip.

UP IN THE MORMON LAND. 
Some like to spend their leisure time, 
At Long Branch, or Cape May ; 
Some ruralize at West Point, 
And some like at home to stay. 
But Nvhelt I 
have a 
week to spare, 
I 
spend it out of hand ; 
I 
take my sweetheart and we go 
Up to the Mormon land. 
cuortus. 
Up in the Mormon land, folks arc not so shy, 
Up in the Mormon land, how is that for high, 
Up in the Mormon land, a 
matrimonial band, 
The easy place for courting is the Mormon land 1 
The rules of strict society, 
Are not to Mormon taste, 
And if I'm so disposed I 
put, 
My arm around her waist. 
Up in the Mormon land, tte. 
Their notions of morality 
Are not so very grand; 
And so they do just what they please, 
Within the Mormon land. 
Up in the Mormon land, folks are not shy, 
Up in the Mormon land, how is that for high, 
tip in the Mormon land, a 
matrimonial band, 
The easy place for courting is the Mormon land 
BA1 
I 
really think I 
shall go wild, 
I 
don't know what -to do, 
I 
love a 
girl, and then we are 
To be wed in a 
week or two. 
She's the darling of my heart, 
Of her I. feel quite vain 
She's the prettiest girl for miles around, 
And Sarah, that's her name. 
CHORUS. 
Oh my you should see my Sarah, 
Smart and fine, she's quite divine, 
As lovely as can be. 
Oh my ! no damsel could be fairer, 
Bandy toes and turn up nose, 
She's all the world to me. 
We have known each other for ever so long, 
And the first time tha(we met, 
She was pushing a 
peanut stand along, 
And the rain came down quite wet. 
I 
helped her to push the barrow along, 
And when we got to the door, 
She gave me a 
penny to treat myself, 
Because she could'nt afford any more. 
On, my ! you should see, (4c. 
Her mother, she keeps a 
peanut. stand, 
And Sally the money does take; 
Of course she looks out for herself, 
For Sarah's wide awake. 
She never gives any one too much change, 
- 
When they go in to buy: 
And if they try to cheat her, she says, 
"Do you see any green in my eye ?'' 
Oh, my! you should see, cto,

And so I

Ere long will cease to roam.

We glided over the rippling wave, 
That in the starlight dances, 
To loving looks you fondly gave 
The brightest, sweetest, glances; 
We watched the silver rays of night 
Above us softly quiver; 
Oh ! life was fair, and rosy bright, 
Upon the Danube river. 
C110111.7S. 
We watched the silver rays of light 
Above us softly quiver ; 
Oh! life was fair, and rosy bright, 
Upon the Danube river. 
I 
held your little hand in mine, 
And thought not of the morrow! 
I 
saw your eyes in beauty shine, 
Undimmed by clouds of sorrow. 
I 
would that both our lives might flow 
As calmly on forever; 
'Twas Cupid at the helm, you know, 
Upon the Danube river! 
We wathcd the silver rays of light 
Above us softly quiver; 
Oh ! life was f . ir, and rosy bright, 
Upon the Danube river. 
THE SPINNING WHEEL. 
Mellow the moonlight to shine is beginning, 
Close by the window young Eileen is spinning ; 
Bent o'er the tire her blind grandmother sitting, 
Is eroaning, and moaning, and drowsily knitting-
" 
Eileen :whom, E. hear some one tapping."

Tis the ivy, dear mother, against the glass flapping."

Lily. I 
surely hear somebody sighing,."

CHORU S. 
.Mtrrliy, cheerily, noiselessly whirring, 
Swings the wheel, spins the wheel, while the foot's stirring 
Sprightly, and brightly, and airily ringing, 
Thrills the sweet voice of the young maiden singing. 
" 
What's the noise that I 
hear at the window. I 
wonder ?" 
" 'Tis the little birds chirping the holly bush under." 
What makes you be shoving and moving your stool on, 
And singing all wrong, that old song of The Coolan r 
There's a 
form at time casement—the form of her true love— 
knd he whispers with face bent ; " 
Waiting tor you love, 
Get up on the stool, through the lattice step lightly, 
We'll rove in the grove while the moon's shining brightly . 
Merrily, cheerily, &e. 
The maid shakes her head, on her lip lays her fingers, 
Steals up from her seat—longs to go and yet lingers : 
A frightened glance turns to her drowsy grandmother, 
Puts one foot on the stool, spins the wheel with the other, 
Lazily, easily swings now the wheel round, 
Slowly and lowly is heard now the reel's sound 
Noiseless and light to the lattice above her 
The maid steps—then leaps to the arms of her lover, 
Slower—and slower—and slower the wheel swings : 
Lower—and lower—and slower the reel rings; , 
Ere the reel and the wheel stopped their ringing and 
moving. 
Through the grove the young lovers by moonlight are 
roving.

WHEN I WAS A CHICKEN. 
A IR :--" Geary Owen." 
When I 
was a 
chicken, as high as a 
hen, 
By the priest I 
was hother'd my lesson to ken; 
" 
As zni oak you must bend," says old Father O'Rook, 
" 
First impression's the thing," then he threw down 
his book. 
While in raptures he took a 
young girl by the hand, 
To give absolution as I 
understand ; 
Oh ho ! thinks 1, you're a 
forestalling thief, 
I'll follow before ye, and turn a 
new leaf. 
With my ta ral la in, &c. 
When a 
few twelvemonths older, says I 
to myself, 
" 
I'll turn out a 
master, and pocket the pelf," 
So I 
washed off the sins from my penitent fair. 
Before they committed them conscience was clear. 
Twas this stamped my fame, and business increased, 
For the ladies all flocked from the north, south, and 
east, 
To receive dispensations and pardons for crime, 
While they shnper'd, " Dear Father, am I 
come in 
time ? 
For your ta ral la," & c. 
Now snug in possession of everything fine, 
A heart full of love, and a 
house full of wine, 
With a 
levee of beauty, delightful my trade is, 
To give absolution to innocent ladies ; 
While Father ()Took turns his eyes in despair, 
Talks of bending of oaks, and reclaiming the fair ; 
"First impression," says I, " told me this was the way 
To teach the young girLs the best way to pray. 
For your ta ral, &c.

'SONG OF THE SEXTON. 
Oh, the sights that I 
see as 1 
ply my lone trade, 
In the moldering dust that a 
cent'ry hath made, 
Where the coffin worm (loth creep. 
I 
began long ago, when my life was still green 
And my mattock and spade have been active, 1 
ween, 
To fashion the grave so deep. 
lb ! I 
laugh as I 
dig, for they all seek my aid, 
To provide them a 
home with my mattock and spade. 
The rich man hath pass'd me with towering head. 
But I 
sang o'er his grave when the scorner_was dead, 
And laugh'd as I 
shoveled the mold. 
The hungry and wretched ne'er entered his door, 
his heart never bled for the wrongs of the poor, 
For the proud man well loved his gold. 
Ho ! 1 
laugh'd as I 
dug, for they wanted my aid, 
To provide him a 
home with my mattock and spade. 
I 
saw a 
young man in the fresh bloom of life, 
As he came to the church with a 
trembling young wife, 
Lift against me the finger of scorn. 
Oh, the revel was joyous, the dance lasted long, 
But the shriek of the widow soon banished the song— 
The young man died ere the morn. 
ITo! I 
laugh'd as I 
dug, when they came for my aid, 
To provide him a 
home with my mattock and spade. 
I 
saw a 
fair child bend her beautiful head, 
And cull the lone floweis that bloom o'er the dead, 
To form a 
pure simple wreath. 
The crimson of hectic suffused her pale face; 
In her eyes fearful lustre I 
trembled to trace 
The herald of early death 
But I 
prayed that ere then, the deep home I 
have made, 
May close over me, and my mattock and spade.

humble is my station, 
A 
grocer by situation,

how shall I 
explain; 
Well I 
loved a 
girl called Kitty, 
Who sells apples in the city, 
On me she'll not take pity, 
Her love I 
tried to gain; 
I've asked her in marriage 
I've a 
donkey and a 
carriage, 
And I'd take her out to Harlem, 
If she'd but name the day 
CHORUS. 
But now she goes each morning, 
And thro' the streets she's hauling 
A 
hand- truck, and loudly calling, 
In a 
voice s ) loud and high, 
Apples ripe and rosy, 
Here's your fine strawberry, 
Damson phuns, and cherries, 
You can taste before you buy. 
I 
oft at market meet her, 
And with smiles I 
greet her, 
And then I 
wish to treat her— 
As one that I 
love dear; 
And if I 
do tell her 
Of some bar:4.ains I 
could sell her, 
A 
nasty low lifed fel;ow. 
Says what do you want here. 
And if to her l'm speaking, 
Perinps with fond words greeting; 
This fyllow's always sneaking, 
And ey'ry word will hear. 
And now she goes, <to. 
I 
made up my mind one morning, 
Upon this fellow calling, 
To tell him of my falling 
In love with Kitty dear, 
Well I 
did repent it, 
For he raised hs fist and sent it 
To my nose and bent it, 
What shall I 
do ? oh dear 
For her I'm always fretting. 
The tears my eyes are wetting, 
So 
drown my woes in betting, 
For l'ye always in my car—

THE OLD, OLD STORY. 
Summer sunbeams softly playing 
Light the woods of Castle Keep 
And there I 
see a 
maiden straying, 
Where the darkest shadows keep. 
She is lisCning meekly, purely, 
To the wooer at her side, 
'Tis the " Old, Old Story," surely, 
Running on like time and tide. 
CHORUS. 
Maiden fair, oil! have a 
care; 
Vows are many, truth is rare, 
Maiden fair, oh! have a 
care, 
Vows are many, truth is rare. • 
He is courtly, she is simple, 
Lordly doublet speaks his lot; 
She is wearing hood and wimple— 
His the castle, her's the cot; 
Sweeter far she deems his whisper 
Than the night-bird's dulcet thrill • 
She is smiling, he beguiling— 
'Tis the " Old, Old Story" still. 
Maiden fair, oh 
have a 
care, & c. 
The autumn sun is quickly going 
Behind the woods of Castle Keep ; 
The air is chill, the night wind blowing,, 
And there I 
see a 
maiden weep. 
Her cheeks are white, her brow is aching, 
The " old, Old Story," sad and brief. 
Of heart betray'd and left nigh breaking, 
In mute despair and lonely grief. 
Maidens fair, oh! have a 
care. &c. 
SAD NEWS FROM HOME. 
Sad news from home for me, 
Friends gather there in gloom 
Friends who have joined in glee, 
Oft in that cottage home. 
But, oh ! how that home is changed now! 
No longer joyful hearts are there, 
Within the tomb that aged brow, 
That aged father's free from care. 
CHORUS. 
Sad news from home for me, 
Friends gather there in gloom; 
Friends who have joined in glee, 
Oft in that cottage home— 
Lonely a 
mother weeps, 
Breaking her heart in vain; 
Mourning for him who sleeps, 
Ne'er to awake again— 
And, oh ! her loved ones by her side, 
So sadly gazing through each tear; 
Without a 
father for their guide, 
Can ne'er again feel happy here. 
Sad news from home for me, &c. 
Far, far away I 
roam, 
Far from my native land; 
Oft will I 
sigh for home, 
Sigh for each kindred hand. 
Though I 
may ne'er again behold 
The home and friends so dear to me, 
There is a 
heaven, we are told, 
Where all that's good on earth shall be. 
Sad news from home for me, (U.

Oh ! shouldn't I

cannot tell why. 
I

rat, 
And I

I

On my belly I

Ettough grub I

And I

Oh ! shouldn't I 
like to get fat ! 
I've often heard people say that 
how very disgus.ed they feel 
To see a 
person overloaded with fat, 
When he ought to be thin and genteel. 
Gentility's all very well, 
But you fat ones have got all the -grin— 
Yon look like as if you never eat a 
smelt, 
When you are so remarkably thin. 
Oh, shouldn t

T'other morning I 
rose from my bed, 
No one on earth could excel— 
I 
devoured a 
box full of eggs, 
And a 
side of fit bacon as well. 
I 
eat oft' a 
loin of cold pork, 
And a 
stunning sheep's head ; 
I 
feed off turkey and chine, 
And I 
picked a 
cow's heel while in ben. 
Oh, shouldn't I 
like, (

A 
score of black puddings for lunch, 
And a 
plate of cold faggots I 
eat; 
And saveloys all of a 
bunch, 
But I 
didn't think them much of a 
treat. 
Sometimes at a 
tater can I 
halt, 
And I 
eat all the man's got in his tin— 
But I 
eat them without any salt, 
Because they say salt makes people look thin. 
Oh, shouldn t 
I

There's my sister Mary Anne I 
declare, 
Was thin as a 
lamp-post in size; 
I 
met her, Vother day, at the fair, 
And I 
could scarcely believe my own eyes— 
She's so chubby and fat to the view— 
What she's been eating I 
cannot make out— 
She's been married six months it is true, 
And she's found out the way to get stout. 
Oh, shouldn't I

HE SLEEPS WHERE HE FELL. 
He sleeps where he fell, 'mid the battle's roar, 
With his comrades true and brave; 
And his noble form we shall see no more— 
It rests in a 
hero's grave : 
-Where the rebel foe in his might came forth, 
With all his power and pride ; 
And our gallant men from the rugged North 
Like patriots fought and died. 
He sleeps near the bill where the bright flowers grow, 
In the wildest woodland shade; 
Where the valley stream in the dell below, 
With an echo fills the glade. 
Where the boasting lines of the traitor-South 
Filed up o'er the grassy banks, 
Till the bursting shells from our cannon's mouth 
Flung death in their broken ranks. 
He sleeps 'Heath the sod where I 
prayfully knelt, 
While the enemy round me stood, 
As I 
took from the corpse his battle-belt, 
Still wet with his heart's warm blood. 
And the summer day closed its light on earth, 
Anti my soul grew sad with pain, 
As they bore me away with oaths and mirth, 
O'er piles of the bleeding slain. 
He sleeps where the blest of our glorious dead 
Were left on the sacred land ; 
Where the daring deeds, ere his spirit tied, 
He led with a 
bold command 
He sleeps—yes, he sleeps. undisturbed by war, 
Thouzb tyrants tram? o'er his breast ; 
For, with those who slumber in glory afar. 
lie takes an immortal rest.

SHE WAS FAT, 
SHE WAS FAIR .— [CONCLUDED.] 
I 
often had dealt at her shop, 
When her manner appear'd rather strange; 
She'd Smile, or a 
soft word let drop, 
And forget p'rhaps to give me my change. 
I 
began to feel funny myself, 
And one day, with my heart in a 
flutter, 
I 
told the dear creature my love, 
The while she was patting her butter. 
Spoken.—Ah! you should have tasted her celebrated " Eight 
penny fresh." 
Oh! but— 
Cho.—She was fair, & e, 
She at first seem'd to not understand, 
Smiled as though it her fancy did tickle; 
And in trying to squeeze her dear hand, 
I 
knock'd down a 
jar of mix'd pickle! 
I 
begg'd of her ten thousand pardons, 
And offer'd the damage to pay; 
But she wouldn't allow it, and hinted 
That the lot might be mine some fine day. 
Spoken.-013, blissful visions of bloaters, pickles, and hair-oil, 
bundle-wood and cheese, tin-tacks and treacle, Fuller's earth and

Next door to my love lived a 
baker, 
Confound him !—too partial to chat; 
I 
so oft found him in at the widow's, 
That I 
fancied some game he was at. 
The worst of it too, he was single, 
And, as I 
thought, made rather too free; 
One day how it made my ears tingle 
When I 
heard him invited to tea. 
Cho.— She was fair, dr.c. 
The next time I 
call'd at the widow's, 
She was in at the baker's next door, 
But she'd left a 
small note which inform'd me 
That I 
needn't call there any more. 
Widow, shop, and all snatch'd from my grasp; 
By the baker I'd nicely been done; 
He married the widow last week— 
Now they've knock'd the two shops into one.

THE SOLDIER'S DREAM OF HOME. 
You have put the children to bed, Alice— 
Maud and Willie and Rose— 
They have lisped their sweet " Our Father," 
And sunk to their night's repose. 
Did you think of me, dear Alice ? 
Did they think of me, and say, 
" 
God bless him, and God bless him! 
Dear father far away ?" 
Oh, my very heart grows sick, Alice, 
I 
long so to behold 
Rose, with her pure, white forehead, 
And Maud, with her curls of gold, 
And Willie, so gay and sprightly, 
So merry and full of glee; 
011, my heart yearns to enfold ye, 
My " smiling group of three !" 
I 
can bear the noisy day, Alice, 
The camp-life, gay and wild, 
Those whom I 
love so dearly, 
Safe in the dear home-fold ? 
THE ROCK OF LIBERTY. 
Oh ! the firin oil rock, the wave- worn rock, 
That braved the blast and the billow's shock ; 
It was born with i 
line on a 
barren shore. 
And it laughed with scorn at the ocean's roar. 
1:1111.S here that first the Pilgrim band, 
Came weary up the foaming strand ; 
And the tree they reared in the days gone by, 
It lives, it lives, it lives, and ne'er shall die. 
Thou stern old rock in the ages past, 
Thy brow was bleached by the warring blast; 
But thy wintry toil with the waves is o'er, 
And the billows beat thy base no more. 
Yet countless as thy sands, old rock, 
Are the hardy sons of the Pilgrim stock ; 
And the tree that reared in the days gone by, 
It lives, it lives, it lives, and ne'er shall die. 
Then rest, old rock, on the sea- beat shore, 
Our sires are lulled by the breaker's roar; 
'Twas here they lived, ' twas here they died, 
Their forms repose on the green hill-side ; 
And the tree they reared in the days gone by, 
It lives, it lives, it lives, and ne'er shall die. (Repeat)

IN VAIN THO' BANISII'D PROM THY HEART. 
In vain though banish'd from thy heart, 
I 
strive to bend to fortune's will. 
I 
cannot with fond memory part. 
Thine image, dear one haunts me still. 
Thy smile, that dazzling beam of light 
That gilded hope's bright morning ray, 
That stared the darkest hours of night , 
I 
worship still tho' turn'd away. 
CHORUS. 
Though banish'd from thy heart still mine 
Remembers thee with fond regret, 
I 
know thy love can ne'er be mine, 
But alt ! I 
never can forget, 
My ever constant thoughts are thine, 
Alt ! no I 
never, never can forget. 
Nor time nor change of scene, to me, 
Afford their balm to soothe my pain; 
My heart tho' broken, clings to thee, 
Reluctant to unloose thy chain. 
Thy form, each feature, Wry grace, 
As first they dawn'd upon my view, 
The tyrant Menfry may retrace, 
But never can one pang subdue. 
Though banish'd from thy heart, still mine, 
Remembers thee with found regret 
1 
know thy love can ne'er be mine. 
But ah ! I 
never can forget. 
My ever constant thoughts are thine, 
Ah no! I 
never, never can forget.

THE FACTORY GIRL. 
By BILLY PASTOIL— AIR. 
Original. 
If there's any young man here in love, 
I 
think that I 
can care him : 
I 
once thought women angels were, 
But now I 
can't endure them, 
For I've been sold by a 
heartless maid, 
Who made of me a 
marlyr : 
She worked in a 
straw- hat factory, 
And her name was Kitty Carter. 
Spoken — She WIIS the nicest little bundle of deceit that 
a man ever met with—she 
lived with her parents—her 
father was brakesman in an Oyster Saloon and her mother 
was book-keeper at an apple stand— but she—oh ! 
CHORUS. 
Her eyes were bright her foot-steps light, 
Her teeth as white as pearls : 
She'd jet black hair, and face as fair, 
My pretty little factory girl— 
I 
never shall forget the day, 
When first I 
chanced to meet her : 
She looked so nice I 
surely thought 
I 
never saw one sweeter. 
What lots of presents for her I 
brought— 
Rings, pins, sacks, shawls and bonnets— 
And I 
hired It poet at ten cents a 
line, 
To write some sweet love sonnets. 
Spoken . — Yes, I 
became highly extravagant and desper-
ately in love— I 
actually paid a 
dollar and a 
half for a 
love 
poem which I 
presented to her : it ran as follows : 
Oh ! Kitty Carter, the hrakernan's darter, 
No girl is smarter to you I'm a 
martyr : 
All the world I'd barter for a 
string of your garter, 
And if you don't prove a 
lartar. 
I'll love you forever, and long art er—for 
Your eyes were brighter, &e. 
I 
sparked her for three months or more, 
At last I 
was delighted : 
I 
pressed her and she named the day 
When we should be united. 
[1] 
31 
THE FACTORY GIRL—[CoweLunEn.] 
O'erjoyed, upon her I 
bestowed 
Such soft and fond caresses. 
And I 
gave her all the cash I 
had 
To purchase wedding dresses. 
Spoken. — Yes I 
was rejoiced when she named the day—I 
rushed straight to the bank, drew all the money I 
had, 
(twenty-seven dollars) and deposited it on her lap : I 
could 
n't help it, because 
Her eyes were bright, &T. 
At last the happy day came round, 
To her house I 
did repair : 
The door was locked and no one home, 
The bride she wasn't there. 
I 
searched all round, she couldn't be found : 
What horror I 
was wrapt in— 
When I 
learned that she had 
eloped that night 
With a 
big canal boat captain ! 
Spoken . — I 
was thunders :ruck—the idea of her serving 
me so after I 
had given her all I 
had in the world !--Aly 
first thought was suicide- 1 
rushed to the nearest saloon 
and called for a 
glass of brat, dy and water and drank it to 
the last drop, and all through her,--for, 
liar eyes were bright, ttc. 
Since then I've wandered all alone, 
With grief I 
am confounded : 
The canal boat got wrecked last week, 
And the faithless girl was drowned. 
I 
went to a 
friend, her burial to attend, 
And I 
nearly lost my senses 
'When the captain ran away. and I 
had to pay 
All of her funeral expenses ! 
Spoken.—Ye. I 
made myself very prominent as:a mourner. 
The undertaker ealled on me to foot the bill. 
I 
had to de 
it. 
Since then I've carefully avoided the entire sex. 
I': 
never go near one of them even if— 
Her eyes were bright, ecc.

MILBURN'S MOTTO; OR, WHILE I LIVE 
CROW. 
I've found a 
plan to make you wise, 
At least to keep you glad; 
To gi,'e no chance for care to rise, 
And laugh at those who're sad. 
For while we live let's taste life's joys, 
You'll find a 
way somehow, 
If you'll adopt my motto, boys, 
That " While I 
live I'll crow." 
CHORUS. 
As gaily on I 
go, 
Be fortune high or low, 
This shall be my motto, boys, 
Win e 
I 
live I'll crew. 
Though some may try to press you down, 
Still keep your head up high. 
And smile, if you should meet a 
frown. 
Don't loose your hope, but try. 
For in this ever busy world 
Each day a 
chance will give. 
So while life's roil is yet unfurled, 
Crow loud, to show you live. 
As gaily on I 
There are some folks in life, I 
know, 
Who, fail rig once, will yield; 
But I 
say mount, and try to crow, 
As monarch of the field. 
If no one else will praise your plan, 
Do so yourself, and show 
You keep your point as Winning man, 
And while you live you crow. 
As gaily on I 
go, arc, 
I 
think my crow's been long and loud, 
So, parting, I 
advise 
That as you mingle '1/
4‘ 
ith the crowd, 
You've every chance to rise, 
If, like a 
game young chanticleer, 
The contrast voull allow, 
Why, flap your wings and show no fear 
But while you live, why, crow. 
As gaily on I 
go, 
Be fortune high or ' ow, 
his shall be my motto, boys, 
While I 
live 
crow. 
I'LL HAVE YOUR NUMBER. 
While walking out the other day a 
pretty girl I 
met, 
She was indeed a 
charmer. I 
never can forget, 
I 
followed her for near a 
mile and to my great surprise, 
She smilingly touched a 
knocker and vanished from my 
eyes. 
CHORUS. 
But I've got the number, the number, the number, 
I've got the number, it's 3642. 
Half mad with love I 
called a 
cab, and asked him for to 
drive, 
To number 3642 away down in Cheapside, 
Oft he went with all his might, and drunk I 
have no doubt, 
Upset the cab and killed the horse and threw me slap bang 
out. 
But I've got his number, &-,
c. 
While embracing mother earth. a 
Peeler quickly said, 
Move on, old chap, quickly too, or I'll punch your head, 
And there to mend the matter, this most inhuman pup, 
Said I 
was drunk, and could not stand, and swore he'd lock 
me up. 
I've got his number, (ke. 
The mob assembled in the street, came jostling around, 
Soon assisted me to rise from off the filthy ground, 
I 
stood like one bewildered, and wildly gazed about, 
As all these inhuman dogs like demons holler'd out, 
I've got his number, &c.

THE POOR MECHANIC'S CHILD. 
Am: —" 
The Soldier's Boy." 
One morning to the city 
Thro' the East- end I 
did stray, 
I 
heard a 
sweet voice singing, 
This simple little lay : 
Kind friends on me take pity, 
Oh give Inc but a 
smile, 
I've wandered from the East-end, 
A poor mechanic's child.' 
Kind friends, ctc, 
I 
asked what s 
your father, 
And pray where has he gone ? 
A shipwright, sir," he answered 
In accents quite forlorn ; 
His work was in the East-end, 
But now there is none there, 
So to look for food for mother 
Father's had to go elsewhere. 
Kind friends, clic. 
A good workman was my father, 
To his children always kind ; 
He's searched all London through and through 
No labour can he find, 
What can we do, how can live, 
We've walked for many a 
mile, 
Yet there's no one will take pity 
On a 
poor mechanic's child." 
Kind friends, (tc. 
Once we had as good a 
home 
As any children could; 
But mother's had to sell if, 
To buy me arid Billy food. 
In the richest city in the world, 
StarvatI:n stares us wild; 
Oh, ye that have the riches, save 
A 
poor mechanic's child." 
Kind friends, d,:c. 
I 
looked, and thought this is the work, 
Of England's rulers great, 
To rob the poor man of his work, 
To keep the rich in state 
Our great men must have hearts like stones, 
Their feelings be beguiled; 
They've made many a 
sorrowing mother, 
Many an orphan child 
kind friends, dr,e. 
KITTY, THE GAMEKEEPERS DAUGHTER. 
-Written and sung by -W ATSON LARGO. 
There are ladies of title that dress out so smart, 
In costumes so neat and pretty ; 
But no one can equal the girl of my heart, 
My pretty little blue-eyed Kitty. 
She is a 
beauty I 
declare— - 
White pearly teeth and auburn hair, 
The angels above you couldn't compare 
With Kitty, the Gamekeeper's Daughter. 
CHORUS. 
For I 
feel so gay, she's named the day, 
And the wedding- ring I 
have bought her ; 
For miles around, the bells they shall play, 
For Kitty, the Gamekeeper's Daughter. 
Her beauty I 
cannot describe unto you— 
She's all that is pure and sweet, 
IIer heart I 
am sure is both honest and true, 
Her dress is so pretty and neat. 
She has admirers you must know, 
Gentlemen that bother her so; 
But still she's accepted me as her beau, 
Has Kitty, the Gamekeeper's Daughter. 
For I_ feel so gay, &C. 
Tho' strange it may seem how we first met, 
'Twas last summer, when out on a 
tour, 
Away down in lIerts—I shall never forget— 
To that pretty little town, Iloxmoor. 
It was one day at her cottage door, 
This sweet erCakIrC f 
iirSt Sfl w, 
Amusing herself by plaiting straw, 
Was Kitty the Gamekeeper's Daughter. 
For I 
feel so gay, Sce. 
must really confess it was love at first sight, 
And for better or worse I 
could take her ; 
I 
determined on making her acquaintance that night, 
And trying my wife to make her. 
I've courted since then, and quite content, 
Her Pa to our marriage nas given consent ; 
And now, kind friends, ' tis my intent 
To marry the Gamekeeper's Daughter. 
For I 
feel so gay, &e.

TRIFLES LIGHT AS AIR—[CoNoLuDED.] 
'Tis hard to lose one's laly love 
And coldly get the sack; 
'Tis hard to lend a 
pound or two 
And never get it back; 
'Tis hard when some relation dies 
And leaves a 
lengthy will, 
To find yourself put -calmly down 
For just exactly nil. 
But follow my prescription, Zio 
It's anything but lively 
To be anything but well, 
When crowds of eager creditors 
Come tugging at your bell; 
And it's pleasant at a 
party when 
Your nerves are going wrong, 
To be asked " as quite a 
favor," for 
A screaming comic song. 
But follow my prescription, tke. 
It's awfully delightful to 
Be told you're getting stout, 
Or when you've got a 
toothache to 
Be urged to have it out, 
And when you take an omnibus 
It's more refreshing still, 
To find yourself at Highbury 
When bound for Notting Hill. 
But follow my prescription, &e.. 
I've suffered many trials in 
The course of my •career, 
And found it hard to see my way 
Particularly clear; 
But I've long ago discovered that 
The proper thing to do, 
Is to go and act precisely as 
I've recommended you. 
I 
take my own prescription as 
The only cure for care, 
And I 
find that all my troubles are 
But " trifles light as air."

THE RESPONSE 
I 
have put the children to bed, harry— 
Rose and Willie and Maud— 
They have sung their hymns together, 
And whispered their prayer to God-
Then Rose said, gently smiling, 
"Come Willie and Maud, now say. 
God bless the dear, sweet father— 
Father so far away r 
And such a 
glad trust arose, Harry. 
In this sad heart of mine, 
For I 
felt that God would keep you 
Safe in his heart divine. 
And I 
kissed their pure, young foreheads. 
And said, " Ile is over all ! 
He eounteth the hairs of your heads, darlings, 
And noteth the sparrow's tall." 
Then I 
sung them to their sleep, harry, 
With hymns all trust and love, 
And I 
know that God was listening 
From His, gracious throne above. 
And since that calm, sweet evening, 
I 
have felt so happy, dear ! 
And so have the children. Harry; 
They seem to know no fear. 
They talk of your coming home, Harry, 
As something sure to be ; 
I 
list to their childish pratings, 
Nor care to check their glee. 
For oh! 'tis a 
cause so noble, 
And you so brave •Ind true : 
And God protects his own, Harry! 
And surely will watch o'er you. 
So keep up a 
brave heart. Harry! 
God willintr,—and lie knows best— 
We'll welcome you. safe :
111(1 happy, 
Back to the dear home- nest. 
And Maud and Rose and Willie 
Shall yet with moistened eye. 
Give thanks to- the dear good Father, 
While you stand tearful by. 
OH LEAVE ME NOT, NY DARLING ONE. 
Oh! leave me not, my darling one, 
There's sorrow in my heart; 
And with thee, should I 
lose thee now 
My last hope would depart! 
COMIC here and kiss my burning brow, 
And let me dearest rest 
Upon that pillow of my love, 
Thy pure and sinless breast. 
I've seen each flower of hope decay, 
Save one, and should that die 
And in its beauty fade away, 
And on the cold ground lie 
All torn and scatter'd like the rest, 
What would become of me ? 
Then leave me not, my loved, my best, 
P11 perish losing thee. 
Thou dost not speak. but in thy face 
I 
read what thou would'st say; 
And this fond kiss and dear embrace 
Bids every fear away 
This truant tear, this burning kiss, 
This smile so sweetly given, 
With rapture fills my soul with bliss, 
And makes this earth a 
heaven. 
WHY DON'T I 
CHANGE MY NAME. 
I've chances had to change my name. 
And so to do I, mean, 
But oh! it seems I 
never shall, 
I've so unlucky been ; 
My name's a 
nice one—Fanny Good— 
It looks well in a 
letter ; 
Now who would change the name of Good 
Unless twere for a 
Cetter ? 
My Pa, my Ma, they scold they fret, 
But I 
am not to blame, 
Although from morn till night they ask 
Why don't I 
change my name? 
I 
had a 
beau—I 
liked him toO, 
At Brighton twas we met ; 
His whiskers were Dundreary ones, • 
Their color black as jet : 
Mama, Papa, went out one day. 
Left us at home quite snug—he 
Went down upon his knees and said, 
Will you be Mrs. Briggey ? 
That such a 
nice young than should have 
A name like that's a 
shame. 
I 
told him. No. And yet they ask. 
Why don't I 
change my name? 
The course of true love never did 
Run smooth they do declare; 
Another beau I 
found—thought I, 
I 
need not yet despair ; 
He wrote tine sonnets to my eyes 
lie brought me charming books, 
But when he did propose I 
found 
his name was Mr. Snooks ! 
Of course I 
cried and told him he 
Must go from whence he came— 
And yet they tease me still and say, 
Why don't I 
change my name? 
Twas at a 
ball just after that 
A partner I 
did gain. 
He pressed my hand—and how he sighed 
When we did ladies' chain ; 
He called next (lay—again—again-
At last, thought I, he'll speak-

WHY DON'T I CHANGE TelY NABIE.—WONCLUDED. 
I 
felt ashamed when out it came, 
sw eet 
love be Mrs. Cheek! 
Upon my cheek I 
felt the blush, 
It must have glowed like flame— 
I'm simmtle still—and still they say, 
Why don't I 
change my name ? 
Both Mr. Quick, and Mr. Slow 
Have sought my hand in vain; 
I 
Mr, Lush and Mr. Low 
Forbade to conic again ; 
Young Gimlet tried to pierce my heart 
But he, like Butcher failed ; 
And Fish and Fags. and Bragg and Briggs, 
All tried but none prevailed. 
I 
would not hesitate I 
vow, 
If Mr. Wright but cattle, 
And yet they tease me still, and ask, 
Why don't I 
change my name? 
I 
could have done with Smith or Brown, 
Have put up with a. Jones, 
Or even with a 
Robinson, 
That Irallle so many owns ; 
Alas! they never came to me, 
My N'ay they didn't jog : 
The nicest man I 
ever knew, 
His name was Mr. Hogg ! 
'Twas Hogg or none my parents said, 
I 
cut him all tile same, 
A rasher match could I 
have made 
For Hogg to change my name ? 
A rose by any other name. 
They say would smell as sweet, 
Alas ! it never was my fate 
A Mr. Rose to meet: 
A single maiden still I 
am. 
In spite of all my trouble, 
I 
would be White or Black, or Dunn, 
Or even Mrs. Double. 
I 
would not be particular, 
But have I 
been to blame 
For ugly names like these to say 
I 
would not change my name.?

WHEN FAIRIES ARE LIGHTED. 
When fairies are lighted by night's silver queen, 
And feast in the meadow or dance in the green, 
My WilHan aside lays his plough and his flail, 
By you oak to sit near me and tell his fond tale. 
And dm' I'm assured the same vows were believed 
By Patty and Ruth, he forsook and deceived ; 
Yet his words are so sweet and like truth so appear, 
That I 
pardon the trewon, the Traitor's so dear. 
I 
saw the straw bonnet he bought at the fair, 
The rose-colored ribbon to deck Jenny's hair; 
The shoe ties for Fanny, and still more than this, 
The gloves he gave Ellen for stealing a 
kiss; 
All these did I 
see, and with heart-rending pain 
Swore to part—yet I 
know when I 
see him again, 
his words and his looks will like truth so appear, 
I 
shall pardon the treason, the Traitor's so dear.

You've heard of my children two, 
Seeking for each other;

Soon followed by her brother. 
There never was so sad

But far more worse than this is ;

Now, have you seen my missus ? 
Right tooral loora la, &c 
She's taken my watch and purse, 
A case with ring and pin in ; 
And then, to make it worse, 
Pawned every bit of linen. 
I

To enjoy the marriage blisses; 
For Fin losing all my tht

Right tooral loora la, &c. 
Wretched there I 
no, 
Till the morn is beaming; 
When I 
fall asleep, 
Strange things I'm a 
dreaming. 
I 
awake full of qualms— 
A hard ease you'll say this is. 
With a 
bolster in my arms, 
Instead of having missus. 
Right tooral loora la, ckc 
Since I 
saw her last, 
None know what I 
suffer; 
Every one I 
ask 
Calls me an old buffer. 
If I 
could see her now. 
I'd smother her with kisses; 
I'm a vretched man, I 
vow— 
Oh, have you seen my missus? 
Right tooral loora la, &c

THE SOLDIER'S ADIEU. 
Adieu, adieu, my only life 
My honor calls me from thee; 
Remember thou'rt a 
soldier's wife, 
Those tears but ill become thee ; 
What though. by duty, I 
am called 
Where thundering cannons rattle, 
Where valor's self might stand appalled, 
When on the wings of my dear love, 
CHORUS. 
To heaven above, 
'1 by fervent orisons are flown, ' 
The tender prayer, . 
Thou puttest up there, 
Shall call a 
guardian angels down, 
To watch me in the battle. 
My safety thy fair truth shall be, 
As sword and buckler serving; 
My life shall be more dear to me, 
Because of thy preserving. 
Let peril come, let horror threat, 
Let thundering cannons rattle, 
I'll fearlessly seek the conflict's heart, 
Assured when on the wings of love, 
To heaven above. &e. 
Enough. with that benignant smile, 
Some kindred God inspired thee, 
Who knew thy bosom vold of guile, 
Who wondered and adored thee, 
I 
go assured. my life. adieu, 
Though thundering cannons rattle, 
Though murdering carnage stalk in view, 
When on the wings of thy true love, 
To heaven above, &c. 
MOONLIGHT AT CAPE MAY 
Oh my poor heart is not my own, 
It was stolen by a 
charming girl, 
Whose eyes are black and full of love 
And her teeth as white as pearl. 
How we first met I'll now tell you: 
'Twas to me such a 
happy day : 
'Twas down on the beach, in the evening, 
In the moonlight at Cape May. 
CHORUS. 
How sweet to me this girl did seem, 
The dear one of my happy dream— 
She's such a 
little beauty, 
Like a 
butterfly light and gay. 
I 
met her on the beach, in the evening, 
In the moonlight at Cape May. 
Oh ! she was gazing calml , 
As the waves rolled near her feet ; 
She turned her head as I 
came by: 
Then, of course, our eyes did meet. 
We spoke about the sweet moonlight, 
While the hours they passed away. 
As we walked, I 
was so happy, 
In the moonlight at Cape May. 
How sweet to me, &c. 
-Next evening as I 
passed the house, 
I 
called my love to see; 
And side by side we rambled on, 
It was hours of bliss to me. 
I 
asked her if she would have me : 
"For I 
love you," I 
did say. 
She promised then to be my wif 
In the moonlight at Cape May. 
How sweet to me. &c.

Old Brown's girl. 
Old Brown, now, he sells very nearly 
Everything you'd please : 
Treacle, soap, and bundles of wood, 
Lollypops and cheese. 
His daughter minds the shop, 
It's a 
treat to see her serve; 
I'd like to run away with her, 
But I 
haven't got the nerve.—Cnoaus. 
Poor old 
old Brown he's very often 
Troubled with the gout, 
lie " grumbles" in the little parlor, 
When he can't get out. 
Then I 
go and make a 
purchase, 
Oh, and when she hands the change, 
That gal makes me feel gal-vanized, 
I 
feels so very strange.—Cnonus. 
Miss Brown she smiles so sweetly, 
When I

But old Brown says that she shall wed 
A marquis or a 
lord; 
But I 
don't think as ever

But, by jingo! next election

THE OLD CLOCK ON THE STAIRS. 
NELLIE MILES. 
Written, composed, and sung by J. Woad. 
Some girls have got two sweethearts, 
Whilst others they have none, 
Of course to play with us poor imps 
They think it jolly fun ; 
But when I 
think of Nellie Miles, 
And of her Quarter Master, 
I 
feel cut up and I 
early dead, 
Like a 
wither'd China-aster. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! Nellie Miles, oh I 
Nellie Milos, 
My heart is beating faster, 
All thro' that look so full of smiles 
You gave the Quarter Master. 
*Twas on the Captain Amstrong, 
He sailed away last week. 
She says she thinks be won't be long, 
So now's my time to speak. 
Last Si Illday Oil my knees I 
went, 
Love's question for to ask her. 
I'd scarce began when I 
was sent 
Right on my Quarter Master. 
Oh! Nellie Miles, 
sze 
Yes, there he stood, he had returned 
Much sooner than expected. 
And there I 
shook, my bead was turned, 
For I 
had been detected. 
She winked at lam. and said " my dear, 
Why the devil didn't you come faster I" 
I 
would said he, but I've prese ts het e, 
From your loving Quarter Master." 
Ob! Nellie Miles, & o. 
His fists at once in my eyes was sent, 
Whilst she wollopped me well behind; 
I 
wished that I 
had knocked him down, 
lie was too big, so I 
declined ; 
Upon the ground, my breeches rent 
I 
lay and called for plaister. 
Old (Map, she says, ' tis toy intent 
To Marry this Quarter Master. 
Oh ! Nellie Miles, Sm. 
Young masculine genders understand, 
This advice to you all I 
offer, 
Don't on your knees attempt to land, 
When courting of the daughtt ,r. 
0:- else some time when walking out, 
And Love it prompts to ask her 
A Seaman's voice in your ear will shout, 
I'm that girl's Quarter Master. 
Oh! Nellis Miles, & c. 
Somewhat back from the village street, 
Stands the old-fashioned country seat ; 
Across its antique portico, 
r1,111 poplar trees their shadows throw; 
And from its station in the hall, 
An ancient time-piece says to all— 
For ever! never ! never! for ever. 
Half way up the stairs it stands, 
And points and beckons with its hands, 
From its case of massive oak, 
Like a 
monk who under his cloak, 
Crosses himself and sighs, alas ! 
With sorro wful voice to all who pass. 
For ever ! never! never! for ever. 
There groups of merry clfflden play'd 
There youths and dreaming maidens stray'd. 
Oh ! prejous hours, oh, golden prime, 
An affluence of love awl time ; 
Even as a 
miser counts his gold. 
Those hours the ancient time-piece told, 
For ever! never! never! for ever. 
From that chamber, cloth'd in white, 
The bride came forth on her wedding night; 
There in that silent room below ; 
The dead lay in his shroud of snow ; 
And in the hush that followed the prayer, 
Was heard the old clock on the stair. 
For ever! never! never! for ever. 
Never lucre, forever there! 
-While all parting pain and care, 
And death and time shall disappear; 
For ever there, but never here! 
The horologue of eternity. 
Sayeth this incessantly. 
For ever! never! never 
for ever.

SERAPHINA SARAH JANE IYIATILDA. 
Just listen to my woes, my trouble I'll disclose, 
And when I 
have related my narration, 
With truth say then you can, Fin a 
victimized young man, 
Deserving of the deepest consolation. 
My name is Richard Green, bamboozled I 
have been. 
The very thought of it does one bewilder; 
I've been caught in a 
snare by a 
feminine so fair. 
Named Seraphina Sarah Jane Matilda. 
CHORUS. 
I've lost my love, alack! I 
shall never get her back, 
Such heartless conduct does my head bewilder. 
To leave me in this way, twas wrong of course- you'll 
:say, 
Of Seraphina Sarah Jane Matilda. 
My Seraphina fair was housemaid in Madison Square, 
And had a 
very tidy situation ; 
Besides her I 
adore. there were thirteen slaveys more. 
Each had a 
Sunday out, too, in rotation, 
Each fourteenth Sunday, T. dressed out so spruce and spry, 
On wings of love did quickly fly to meet her : 
I 
felt enraptured quite, and oft said, with delight, 
That I 
without a 
bit of salt could eat her, 
I've lost my love, &e. 
But, one unlucky day, I 
chanced to pass her way, 
A lean and lanky policeman near was standing, 
I 
staggered back, oh law! I 
my Seraphina saw 
A sandwich up the area to him handing, 
With rage my bosom glowed, I 
hollered, Well. I'm Wowed 
[1] 
SERAPHINA SARAH JANE MATILDA . (CONCLUDED. 
You've been and guy me the mit for another ! 
Said she, be oil', you goose,you ain't a 
bit of use. 
Don't think I 
lov'd you, cause lwas more Cother. 
I've lost my love, & e. 
Such conduct gave me pain, my tears came down like rain, 
Said she, Don't put yourself in such a 
flurry. 
The words she used to me, I've tried, but failed to see 
In Webster, Johnson or in Lindley Murray. 
Said I, Your words perlite, arn't dictionary quite. 
Said she, It jest the langwidge is to suit yer, 
As for dickshunary's too, I 
think twixt me and you, 
You'd better Dick shun areas for the future 
I've lost my love, &e. 
The cruel peeler he in custody took me, 
Charged me with lurking round the area; 
My jugular he scragged, to the station I 
was dragged, 
Which placed me in a 
very queer quandary, 
I 
was confined as well, all night in a 
cold cell, 
And shivery anti shaky in the morning; 
I 
stood before the judge, 'gainst whom I 
owe a 
grudge, 
For giving me a 
twelvemonth as a 
warning 
I've lost my love, ktc 
So single men beware of the false and fickle fair, 
Know well on whom you're fixing your affection, 
Just mind you're not caught slap, like mice are in a 
trap, 
Lest afterwards you suffer a 
rejection. 
Take warning pray by me let this a 
lesson be, 
Don't let the female sex your heads bewilder; 
You see without a 
doubt, how I 
have been tarred out, 
By my Seraphina Sarah Jane Matilda. 
I've lost my love, fke.

THE HAPPY YOUNG COSTER. 
Written and sung by G. M ATELW. 
You can sec. fut a 
jolly young mister, 
And ti few pounds I 
have by my side, 
So I 
thought I 
would make up my mind, boys, 
And start in the custering trade. 
And sticking to my rounds each morning, 
A lot of customers why I 
soon found, 
Which enables me, you know, my boys, 
To 
holler when going my rounds. 
cnor.us. 
Here's your fine strawberry, 
Apples four-a- penny, 
Currants and plums come every one, 
And taste before you buy ; 
Cabbage and turniptops, 
Celery and brokelo, 
Onions and beans, potatoes and greens, 
it is my daily cry. 
Now I 
am up with the lark in the morning, 
To market me and my moke do go, 
To buy my wares of the best kind 
And then we soon trot home again. 
We ha's a 
little bit of a 
rest then. 
And then I 
prepare to go on my rounds, 
And I 
have not been out long, before, boys, 
Why you will soon hear nie hollering out. 
Here's your fine, &e. 
The servants all know when I 
am coming, 
By I 
he sound of my voice when I 
cry, 
And when my goods I 
do show them, 
Bless their hearts they always do buy; 
And it to my trade I 
do stick, boys, 
I 
know my fortune is then made, 
And then I 
can be independent, 
And give up the costering trade. 
Here's your fine, & e. 
But before 1 
leave you all to-night, 
I 
must let you all into a 
secret, 
For I 
have been courting such a 
pretty girl, 
And she has promised to be my wife. 
Now Sal and me I 
know will be happy, 
And if any children we have. 
We'll bring them up to the eostering 
And you will hear them hollering out. 
Here's you fine, cte. 
FALSE ALBERTINA. 
Writeu and sung by ALBERT DE 
VOY. 
I 
fell in love with a 
nice young girl, 
While in a 
situation, 
She lived head cook at a 
large hotel, 
Near Shoreditch Railway eAation, 
She vowed she loved me faithfully 
And that she would be mine, oh, 
And agreed with me to share her fate. 
I 
thought that very fine, oh. 
CHORUS. 
But she ran away with a 
Horse-guard Blue, 
I 
wish I 
ne'er had seen her, 
For I'm weeping and Fin willing, and don't know what to 
do, 
For I've lost my Albertina. 
I 
bought her fine dresses and 
New bonnets shawl and laces, 
I 
treated her to Epsom Downs, 
To see the Derby Races. 
'Twas there she saw this Horse-guard Blue, 
Who asked her to take wine, oh, 
Then treated her to the Grand Stand, 
A wretched fate was mine, oh. 
But she ran away, &e. 
I 
began to see she slighted me. 
So I 
thought I'd go one morning, 
To her and have it all explained, 
But from me take a 
warning. 
For there upon the doorstep 
My rival he was standing. 
I 
flew into a 
dreadful rage. 
And satisfaction was demanding 
But she ran away, &c. 
My hat he then smashed o'er my eyes, 
And banged me left and right, sirs, 
A Bobby hard up for a 
job. 
lie collared me for the night, sirs. 
There may Wimps be some girl unwed, 
Who's lost her false young lover, 
And if she'll have me in his stead, 
We may console each other. 
But she ran away, &c.

T.:1E FIRST DEAR THING THAT E'ER I LOVED 
The first dear thing that ever I 
loved 
Was a 
mother's beaming eye, 
That smiled as I 
woke on the dreamy couch, 
That cradled my infancy : 
I 
never forgot the joyous thrill, 
That smile in my bosom stirred ; 
Nor how it could charm me against my will 
.t1 4 
Till I 
laughed like a 
joyous bird. 
And the next fair thing that ever I 
loved 
Was a 
bunch of summer dowers, 
With odors, and hues, and loveliness, 
Fresh as Eden's bowers— 
I 
never can find such line again. 
Nor smell such sweet perfume; 
And if there be odors as sweet as they, 
'Tis I 
that have lost my bloom. 
And the next dear thing I 
was fond to love, 
Is tenderer far to tell ; 
'Twas a 
voice, and a 
hand and a 
gentle eye 
That dazzled me with its spell ; 
And the loveliest things that I 
had loved before 
Were only the landscape now. 
On the canvas bright where I 
pictured her 
in the glow of my early vow. 
And the next good thing I 
was fain to love 
Was to sit in my cell alone, 
Musing o'er those lovely things, 
Forever, forever flown. 
And the last dear thing I 
was fond to love 
Was that holy sevice nigh, 
That lifted my soul to joys above, 
And pleasurs that do not die. 
HANDSOME DICK THE MUFFIN MAN. 
In Belgravo Square there liv'd a 
maid, 
Her name was Susan, it was said, 
And parte/ maid she long had been 
To a 
rich old gent called Squire Green. 
The coachman tried her heart to win, 
But his fellow-servants, with a 
grin, - 
Cried, " Ah, there's no chance for you, Dan 
For Susan loves her muffin Mau." 
CHORUS. 
With his curly hair and handsome nose 
He really was the pink of beaux— 
Find such another few girls can, 
As handsome Dick the Muffin Man. 
Dick called one day to see his Sue, 
And what befel I'll tell to you, 
The master came home unawares, 
Poor Susan bolted down the stairs, 
Crying, " Cookee, I'm in such a 
tright, 
here's master coming home nearly tight, 
Do cookeo, pray devise some plan, 
To save my handsome muffin man. ' 
With his curly hair, & o. 
Now cook was tall and fat, you see, 
Amt dearly loved a 
jolly spree— 
She dressed I ) ick up in woman's clothes, 
.A., •d he look.d a 
strapper, goodness knows. 
But Dau the coac!'man found it out, 
And out of pure revenge no doubt, 
With his slory to the master ran, 
To betray poor Dick the muffin mall. 
With his curly hair, &c 
The master to the kitchen hied, 
And Dick in fetnal • dress espied, 
lie vowed be honored female charms, 
Then round poor Dick he threw his arms— 
Dick didn't like the kissing part, 
So for the stairs he made a 
start, 
lie gained the streets, when a 
race began 
After handsome Dick the muffin man. 
-Wi h 
hi 3 
curly hair, &o. 
Dick ran as if for life or death, 
But he was caught when out of -breath, 
By brave policeman ninety-eight, 
And went before a 
magistrate : 
As Dick had done 710 harm, -why he 
Was quickly set at at liberty ; 
And Susan. as the story ran, 
Was married to her muffin man. 
With his early hair, &a. 
Ant—" Popsy \Topsy." 
I 
am a 
forsaken colleen, 
A broken-hearted colleen ; 
My Patsy's gone and left me, 
He has gone to tight for the green. 
Re has gone to join those Fenians, 
Those bold, undaunted Fenians; 
And while he's getting murthered, 
I'm left alone to sing. 
Oh, my Patsy Watsy 'listed from my sight. 
And he was captured by the peelers Cother night ; 
But he wasn't taken without having a 
tight, 
And no doubt he'll be banished for about twenty years or 
more. 
He was a 
bow-hi, brave gosoon, 
A noble-hearted gosoon ; 
He always was so good to me, 
lie never refused me anything. 
But my heart is broke entirely, 
Yes it is gone entirely. 
And tile hole where it once was, 
You could roll a 
head of cabbage in. 
Oh, my Patsy Watsy, &c. 
But the boys are going to retake him, 
They sware they will retake him; 
They are going home in ship- loads, 
To be led by George Francis Train. 
And when they bring him back to me, 
It will make me feel so happily,

The aim of the author of " DE 
W ITT's CONNECTICUT COOK BOOK " 
has 
been to strp the art of cooking of all useless preparations, and all the un-
meaning jargon of the cuisine; and to write in a 
plain, common-sense way, 
giving only directions that have been tried and not found wanting. 
Every 
mode of Cooking and Preserving described in these pages are the results of 
actual personal experience; and have never failed to produce the best tasting 
as well as the best looking dishes that can be placed on the table. 
Let any 
housewife follow the directions, and our word for it: Good, digestion will 
surely " wait on appetite."
