TWO BABES IN THE WOODS
My dears, do you know how a long time ago Two poor little babes whose names I don'
know Were stolen away on a bright summer day And left in the woods, so I've heard
people say. (repeat*)
And when it was night, how sad was their plight, The sun it went down and the moon gave
no light. They sobbed and they sighed and they bitterly cried, And the poor little things,
they lay down and died. (repeat)
And when they were dead, the robins so red Brought strawberry leaves and over them
spread, And all the day long, they sang them this song: Poor babes in the woods, poor
babes in the woods! And don' you remember the babes in the woods.?
