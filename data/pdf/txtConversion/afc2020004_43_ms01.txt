From Dissolve 
 
 
Bluing under a dimming North Star, 
the Reservation’s ghost  
paws cartilage pincered from a digital cloud. 
 
Its gnawed bones’ opaque sigh— 
the pallor of bleached wasp eggs, 
throbs on tree knobs  
penciled in with burnt ivory smell. 
 
Rising out of the uranium pond— 
home picks: bird flight  
from a cartouche box, 
it then becomes a chain of floating islands. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Slipping into free-fall, 
we drip-pattern: the somewhere parts, 
our shoulders dissolving 
     
 
in somewhere mud. 
 
The arcing sun whistles 
across the mask's abalone brow, 
its blurring pouts into a forest  
chirping from a lake's bite marks 
stamped vertically on this map's windowsill. 
 
Kneeling our thoughts on ellipses 
evaporating from ollas of fragrant wet clay— 
we saddle the drowning's slippery rim. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A hovering smear  
trailing desert washes  
fenced in with a murder of mirrors 
illumines the eating groaning over us. 
 
Nibbling blades of winter light: 
the goat’s bleating leased downwind 
pastures among foals dripping out  
of hollowed-out dictionaries. 
 
Jeweled with houseflies,  
leather rattles, foil-wrapped, 
ferment in beaked masks 
on the shores of evaporating lakes. 
 
This plot, now a hotel garden, 
its fountain gushing forth— 
the slashed wrists of the Colorado.
