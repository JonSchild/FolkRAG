Mike Weaver interviewed by Vyta Pivo on May 26, 2021 at the Lehigh Cement Company Plant 
in Evansville, Pennsylvania. The interview transcript has been edited for clarity.  
 
[00:00:00] 
 
Vyta Pivo: 
Today is Wednesday, May 26, 2021. This is an interview for the occupational 
history archive, which is part of the Folklife Center at the Library of Congress, funded by the 
Archie Greene Fellowship. As part of this project, I am interviewing cement workers in the 
Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania, the birthplace of the modern cement industry and the United 
States. The recording and transcript will become part of the permanent collection at the Library 
of Congress. I am Vyta Pivo and today I'm speaking with Mike Weaver here at the Lehigh 
Cement Company Plant in Evansville, Pennsylvania. And just to confirm, you, give me your 
permission to record the interview, is that correct?  
 
Mike Weaver:  
Yes.  
 
VP: 
Thank you so much. Uh, could you tell me your full name, year of birth, and where you 
were born?  
 
MW: My name is Michael James Weaver. My birthday is 1978, and I was born in Redding, 
Pennsylvania.  
 
VP: 
Is that where you grew up?  
 
MW: I grew up in Leesport, Pennsylvania.  
 
VP: 
And where is that? 
 
MW: It's probably five miles down the road.  
 
VP: 
Wow, so local.  
 
MW: Very close. Very close.  
 
VP: 
So, when did you first learn about the cement industry?  
 
MW: Oh, probably my whole life. My dad worked here for 43 years.  
 
VP: 
At this plant? 
 
MW: Yes.  
 
VP: 
What job did he do?  
 
MW: He was maintenance for, I think, most of it, if not all of it.  
 
VP: 
Wow. And when did you start working here?  
 
2 
 
MW: Uh, 2000. February of 2000.  
 
VP: 
So, growing up, did you come to visit the plant?  
 
[00:01:28] 
 
MW: Yeah, I actually used to go fishing out back when I was a kid, would come on the 
weekends and we'd go out to go fishing when I was a little old, you know. Yeah, a lot of picnics, 
you know, with coworkers. And I grew up with, you know, other people's kids. And some of 
them work here now. So, it's kind of cool, kind of cool.  
 
VP: 
When you were a kid, what did you think about the plant?  
 
MW: When I started here? 
 
VP: 
When you were coming in as a child. 
 
MW: I was just in awe because, you know, I was a kid and, you know, so big and all the 
machinery and stuff. Yeah, it's always neat. I used to, you know, when I started here, it's kind 
of weird when I walked into the washhouse my first day when I started, it's still, that smell, the 
way it smells, I remembered that from [when I was] a kid, still smelled the same way. It's kind 
of weird, but, you know, it just took me back to when I was a kid.  
 
VP: 
What's the smell like? Can you describe it?  
 
MW: I can't, I can't even put into words. It's whatever they use to clean. There was something 
that they used on the floor, I think it was, but weird.   
 
VP: 
It’s kind of like eating something that you eat in childhood, right?  
 
MW: Yes.  
 
VP: 
So, did you get to, like, build stuff with concrete growing up with your dad, or did you 
not use cement very much?  
 
MW: No, we didn't use cement at home very much. But he taught me how to weld, work on 
cars, built things at home, that type of stuff. And I followed through with it. You know, I want 
to tech for welding and that's where it all started.  
 
VP: 
Did your dad encourage you to go into the cement industry?  
 
[00:03:16] 
 
MW: No, actually, I wanted to be a welder. That's what I had my eyes on. And I kind of grew 
out of that, was more into fabricating. And then when I started here, I started, I was 
maintenance. So, I started working on machinery, that type of stuff. And I kind of liked it. If I 
could still fabricate and weld. It was a mixed bag of things. And that's, you know, that’s where 
that come from, I guess.  
 
3 
 
VP: 
Did your dad give you, like, share stories that were especially impressive for you or 
maybe … 
 
MW: Um, just about like the stories of how they did things years ago, you know, that type of 
stuff compared to how we do it now, you know, like I'm the newer generation and sometimes 
the newer and older generation kind of clash. You know, they thought that their way was better, 
we thought our way was better. You know, we're faster. What have you. Yeah.  
 
VP: 
What stood out to you the most about the way they did things back then?  
 
[00:04:17] 
 
MW: The phrase when men were men, they worked, they worked hard. You know, they 
didn't … what's the word I'm looking for… just, things were done differently, you know, lot of 
it was you didn't have a machine to do the work, you did it with your hands, you know, like a 
chain fall. Now we have a hoise, all you do is push a button without yanking on a chain. You 
know, they got a bunch of tunnels on the other end of it. Now, all you got to do is hit a button. 
You know, you're not hurting yourself or physically, you know, wasn't as physical as it was, 
but.  
 
VP: 
And so now when you're still working with some of these old timers, how does it change 
the work culture with the young and the old guys together?  
 
MW: How does it change? I think they slowly kind of adapted, realizing that, you know, their 
ways are antiquated and there's a faster and a more safer way to do something or easier way to 
do something. So doing anything manually, you know, there was some head buddings at times, 
but, you know, it was neat. I'm glad looking back and kind of glad, you know, I did what I did 
and where I ended up. It’s kind of interesting.  
 
VP: 
So, did you start in maintenance when you came to the plant?  
 
[00:05:56] 
 
MW: I was a laborer for probably a year and a half during that time, the laborers would fill 
in on different things. I was the payloader fill-in for probably a year. I had a part time skid 
loader position for maybe a year after year maybe. And then right from labor, I went to 
maintenance. I was a bit on first-class maintenance position. Back then you had welders, you 
had a first class and a second class. Second class was like a helper, first class was like the lead 
man that made all decisions. And I jumped right into the first-class position, even not knowing, 
you know, not working maintenance here, not knowing a lot. But I was blessed to work with 
some very good people that taught me a lot of things. So, that was kind of cool.  
 
VP: 
So, what types of jobs did you do as a laborer? 
 
MW: Clean up piles, jackhammering, that type of stuff mostly just clean up.  
 
VP: 
Did you like it?  
 
MW: No, not really. I mean, manual work, it's hot, that type of stuff. It wasn't fun, but it's a 
paycheck.  
4 
 
 
VP: 
And so, then did you get to bid where you wanted to go next?  
 
MW: They posted a job and I bid on it and got it. But back then it was weird because I didn't 
have any seniority. So, somehow I guess a lot of people didn't want maintenance at that time 
and that's how I got it. So, I kind of stepped right into it. I got lucky.  
 
VP: 
Why did folks not want maintenance? 
 
MW: I don't know. There's a there's a struggle there every couple of years. You know, 
maintenance is a place to be a couple years later production. It all depends on a lot of things. I 
think leadership, you know, I think that played a big part of it. You know, sometimes the other 
departments aren't, as you know, they don't have their stuff together, but it comes and goes. 
It's…   
 
VP: 
It depends on the people.  And so you mentioned you did welding, so what's involved 
in that work?  
 
MW: Just cutting metal, like fabricating things. You know, the piece might be rotted out or 
what have you. You'll take measurements and replace the piece or even make something 
completely new. You know, it's a new piece of machinery or a new shoot for whatever.  
 
VP: 
So, can you describe, like, what types of tools that you use or machines in this work?  
 
[00:08:36] 
 
MW: Yeah, probably with burning outfits, welding machines, all kinds of hand tools, 
wrenches. We have an iron worker in the shop, we were shear, we have a roller and roll steel. 
We have a [unclear] the big man lift, which is very handy, you know, to reach things, crane 
and stuff.  
 
VP: 
Do you have particular tools that you like to use?  
 
MW: No, not really. It all depends. I mean, depends on the job and what you're doing,  
 
VP: 
What types of machines or what types of things have you felt like you said you have to 
kind of create from scratch?  
 
MW: Like not long ago or just put a new chute in, there was really no [unclear], it was just, 
we kind of filled it [unclear] type of thing and it worked out really well. I mean, it was a kind 
of a culmination between, you know, me and the guys doing the work. Everybody had an idea 
and we kind of worked it out and went with it.  
 
VP: 
Are there particular machine parts that you have to regularly replace or fix?  
 
MW: Yeah, like every year we'll have an outage, we'll go through the cooler, we’ll change 
wheels, the cooler grates, that type of stuff. The cooler drag will inspect it, maybe replace the 
chain if it's bad or the pins, or shoes on the on the drive end, they get worn out. You know, 
elevator buckets, there is so much, there's so much to list.  
 
5 
 
VP: 
And do you what do you walk around the plant looking to identify problems spots?  
 
MW: Yes. Like now three years ago I became a supervisor. So, now I do walk around, I'll 
give my guys their jobs. But during that time I'll stop in and check on them, look around at 
other things, even just walking around, you know, looking for stuff where you’ll hear 
something, hear a noise, check it out. A lot of it is by hearing, oddly enough, you can tell when 
something's not right.  
 
VP: 
What does that sound like?  
 
MW: It all depends on what it is. You know, you'll have a role or that squealing. I mean, his 
bearings are probably bad in the roller, the conveyor belt. You get sometimes, you can tell 
when there's a liner out in the mill just by the sound of it. It doesn't, it doesn't sound right.  
 
VP: 
How do you decide who gets what job?  
 
[00:11:18] 
 
MW: Well, like, oddly enough, because I worked here for twenty years, like I was on the 
union side for most of them, all but two of them now. I've worked with them guys for so long, 
I know their abilities, I know what they can and can't do. So, that plays a big part into it. You 
have the younger guys, too, that are willing to learn. So, you'll put them with a more 
experienced person to learn from, that’s how I learned. So, yeah, I mean, you got guys that are 
better at certain things, like some guys can weld really well and others can't, you know, they're 
not that strong at it or they’re not that experience with it.   
 
VP: 
Is there are a lot of kind of physical work involved and moving parts and lifting things?  
 
MW: And yes, it's very physical, very physical, which is why I wanted to become a 
supervisor, because I thought I was starting to feel it. I was starting to feel it. And I didn't want 
to be that old, miserable old man, you know, in the lunchroom complaining because, like, my 
dad was that way. You know, all the older guys felt it, you know, and I was at my age, I felt 
like I plateaued. I got to a point where I was content, I didn't know everything, but I knew 
enough. And the opportunity arose and I jumped on it.  
 
VP: 
And so, you mentioned you felt it, what exactly were you feeling? 
 
[00:12:41] 
 
MW: The physical pain, I mean.  
 
VP: 
A particular part of your body?  
 
MW: Carpal tunnel. You know, I never got it fixed. I know for sure I have it, but I never got 
it fixed. I have no glasses in my house because of that reason, because I drop them. But, uh, 
yeah. Just tired, your muscles ache. I’m not a spring chicken anymore, you know, that type of 
thing. You don't bounce back as quick as you used to either.  
 
VP: 
And how about your dad? Was he doing the same things or …? 
 
6 
 
MW: Just a part of getting old, you know, aches and pains and that type of thing.  
 
VP: 
Are there particular jobs at the plant that are easier on the body that you could transition 
into besides supervision?  
 
MW: Oh, yeah. Yeah. You could go to shipping some of the production jobs like the loader 
operator, that type of thing. That's not very physical.  
 
VP: 
Did your dad ever consider doing that?  
 
MW: No, I don't think so. I don't think he I don't think he ever thought about it or even wanted 
to, to be honest. He was just he was good at what he did, too, so.  
 
VP: 
And would you say maintenance is one of the more challenging positions?  
 
MW: Yeah, yeah, there's a lot of moving parts. There's a lot of planning involved because of 
the production aspect, that type of thing. Yeah, it's some of the equipment isn't the nicest to 
work on at times, depending on where it is or, you know, sometimes it's really, really hot or it's 
really, really cold, you know, depending on the time of year, normally hot and cold. But, yeah.  
 
VP: 
And, uh, I've heard from some folks that you have to climb into some tight spaces.  
 
MW: Yeah. You have some very tight, awkward spaces to crawl into and get out of the times, 
which is, can be challenging.  
 
VP: 
What's the most awkward that you've experienced?  
 
[00:14:42] 
 
MW: I've been stuck in the slide dryer getting out of it. I couldn't get out of it and like I wanted 
to do work, but then I couldn't get out.  
 
VP: 
How did you get out?  
 
MW: Eventually I worked myself out of it, but it took it. I got stuck. I started to freak out a 
little bit, but then I got my work my way back out, calmed down a little bit. And then I also 
had some help, too. That was always interesting.  
 
VP: 
How about getting up to tall heights?  
 
MW: Yeah, I'm not, I'm not a fan of heights, so that can be difficult. It took me a long time 
to get comfortable, like walking out on the mill to pull lids, took me a long time to get 
comfortable with that. I was always afraid of falling.  
 
VP: 
Do guys fall often? 
 
MW: No, it’s not a normal thing, but the chance is always there is always there.  
 
VP: 
 What's it like to work around dust?  
 
7 
 
MW: It's it takes a special person. Some people hate it. I think over time you just get used to 
it.  
 
VP: 
So, could you describe a typical day for you at work?  
 
[00:16:06] 
 
MW: I get here anywhere between 4 and 4:30 in the morning. My guys work, we have the 
gang split right now because of Covid, the guys work 5AM to 1PM, the other group 7AM to 
3PM. So, I got here and I'm between 4 and 4:30AM. I line out the schedule because, you know, 
line up the jobs, print out the work orders. I'll go down to the guys at five o'clock, we’ll do a 
safety meeting, safety talk. I'll hand out the jobs, I'll talk to them about their jobs, if they have 
any questions. Then I'll grab the work orders from the previous day. I'll grab the timecards, I 
go to my office, I check all the time cards. I close all the work orders I need to be closed. I'll 
scan the take-five papers and I’ll also look at their workplace exams from the previous day and 
make a work order if it needs one or I'll make sure the right person gets that information and 
then, I just go out, I supervise my guys, I walk around a lot, just check things, make sure 
everybody has what they need, have safety conversations with the guys throughout the day 
order parts if need be. I'm also in charge of the garage and all the mobile equipment. So, that's 
another aspect that is very stressful in my job right now. I have to do a lot of parts for the 
mobile equipment, line up any contractors, like for the loaders if, you know, if it needs to be 
fixed because they have to plug in. A lot of times I plug in a laptop to it. That's something our 
mechanic can’t do. So, that gets stressful, especially with the demand of our payloader. It's 
very, very important that it gets running as fast and efficiently as it can be.  
 
VP: 
So how long do jobs typically take to finish?  
 
MW: Just a normal eight hours, just in the normal job, like if we do inspections, you know, 
depending on the equipment, it'll take about eight hours, it’s a day's work. There are bigger 
jobs we'll have to plan, you know, and we'll put more people on. And sometimes another shift, 
you know, go around the clock, for the most part, the regular, normal day’s eight hours, if it 
takes longer, we’ll do overtime, that type of thing.  
 
VP: 
So, what would be an example of a normal job and then an example of a longer job?  
 
[00:18:47] 
 
MW: An example of a normal job, like an elevator inspection to be a normal job. You know, 
you check the drive, you open up the bottom, you check the bottom or take out bearings, that 
type of thing. You'll measure the chain, record anything that needs, you know, and then you’ll 
close it back up, test run it. As far as a bigger job, I would say, like the [unclear] screws up, 
that's a bigger job because all three mills have the same screws. So, you have to, that's 
something that has to be really planned because all the mills will be down. That's something 
we'll work around the clock on with, you know, two different shifts, 12 hours. Also, labor gets 
involved because the thing has to be cleaned out and takes time.  
 
VP: 
So how do you measure performance of your staff?  
 
[00:19:40] 
 
8 
 
MW: Of my guys? Uh, I just watch them, you know, ask them questions, do they need 
anything, you know, that type of stuff. I'll talk to their coworkers, see what they feel, how they 
feel about them, what their thoughts are. It's kind of judge off of that a lot, too.  
 
VP: 
Um, so, uh, how would you say automation has impacted the work that you do?  
 
MW: Um, my work, I wouldn't say a lot. 
 
VP: 
But maintenance in general? 
 
MW: Maintenance in general, there's not a lot of automation. Production there is, over in the 
packhouse there is, but not in maintenance.  
 
VP: 
And so, some of the jobs we were talking about were preventative maintenance. 
 
MW: Mhm. 
 
VP: 
So, um, are there kind of schedules that you follow to check machines on a regular 
basis?  
 
MW: Yes, we have a PM program and a schedule that we go by. 
 
VP: 
And what’s the ration of preventative maintenance versus responding to an urgent need? 
 
MW: Um, we do a PM raise, your PMs all the time, you won’t have the fires. There's always 
something, there's always something that gets you.  
 
VP: 
So, how would you say Covid has impacted the work, you mentioned you had to split …  
 
[00:21:10] 
 
MW: It's been very, very challenging. Like me as a supervisor, I have to keep the same people 
working together, but the same aspect, when something breaks and we need it, you know, I 
can't, there's times I can't keep the same people together. So, that's stressful. It's just been very 
demanding. The mask, you know, it's hot, it gets annoying. Just to follow the rules and it's ever 
changing, which makes it complicated. You know, every day it’s different, it seems. But then 
to keep the guys in line, you know, with them wearing their masks, making sure they're 
separated. Yeah, that can be challenging.  
 
VP: 
Are you excited for this to be over?  
 
MW: Yeah. I can't wait, I can't wait.  
 
VP: 
Um, so what do you do to relax after work?  
 
MW: Um, I have a lot of little kids at home. I got I got four little kids, one grown, I spend a 
lot of time with them, they’re a lot of fun. I like to kayak, I kayak quite a bit, just been outside 
anything outside. I like dirt track racing, I go to the races a lot to spend more time with family. 
That's most important to me.  
 
9 
 
VP: 
Do you ever get together with your coworkers?  
 
[00:22:37] 
 
MW: Yeah. Yeah, not as much now because of Covid, we keep our distance. But yeah, it's a 
family, a lot of friends here, you know, a lot of friends. Like I said, I've been around here 
forever. The hunting camp I actually go to is all ex-, they’re old retired employees and or still 
working employees. So, a lot of people, a lot of people hanging out outside of work here.  
 
VP: 
Do you talk about cement? 
 
MW: Uh, yeah. I mean, not so much about cement, but, you know, that stuff comes up. People 
talk, you know. Uh, yeah.  
 
VP: 
What do they talk about?  
 
MW: Just something that might have happened or, you know, what direction we're headed or 
how things have changed. I remember one conversation I had with, I was in a vehicle, we were 
up at [unclear] camps, and I was with my dad and two older retired employees. And I think my 
best friend was [unclear], he also works there. And I said, did you ever guys think, looking 
back, you know, when I was a kid, that I'd be working, you know, with you guys, you know? 
And it was just neat, neat experience. I think about that a lot, you know. I used to go 
snowmobiling with the one guy that worked here, one of the older guys, so.  
 
VP: 
And so, what did they say, did they expect you to join the industry?  
 
MW: No, they were just, you know, there's a lot of family that works here. It's not a given 
that it's going to happen. But, you know, just sometimes you just know, you know, it's just it's 
very humbling, it's a neat situation. And they're very proud of me, they're proud of how far I've 
come and grew, you know? So that was kind of cool.  
 
VP: 
Why do you think people continue to come and work in the industry?  
 
MW: Oh, it's a good job to have, pays well, good insurance, you know the travel. A lot of 
people live close, that’s a big key.   
 
VP: 
Do you feel like workers are especially proud of being here in the Lehigh Valley as 
opposed to somewhere else?  
 
MW: Uh, I don't know. There's a lot of pride here for sure. You know, especially the 
maintenance department. There's a lot of pride, the guys take their time, they want to do things 
right. Obviously, so they don't have to go back to it, but there's not a lot of rework, you know, 
they do their best.  
 
VP: 
So, is there a particular part of your work that is especially challenging?  
 
MW: Like I said, the garage has been very stressful, especially lately. We've had a lot of 
issues with our payloaders. I have a hard time balancing my home-work life. That's a challenge 
for me. Yeah, it's, that's big for me, something I'm working on. 
 
10 
 
VP: 
Your wife is complaining? 
 
MW: No, she doesn't complain. We have a lot of younger supervisors here, especially in 
production, and they know they can reach out to me and call me whenever. But, just annoying 
when the phone calls at like two o'clock in the morning. But, yeah.  
 
VP: 
Have you brought your kids to the plant?  
 
MW: Yeah, they were in the parking lot. My kids love trains and, you know, now we have 
rail work, so. And the track mobile, they've seen it come by and I take videos of the train when 
it comes so they can see it. So yeah, that's cool.  
 
VP: 
Is there a part of your work that you enjoy the most, like you’re kind of most proud of?  
 
[00:26:40] 
 
MW: Um, just, just. Well, it's the way I did things, you know, I had a lot of good people show 
me a lot of good things when I was younger and I paid attention. And I in turn can pass that 
knowledge along. I'm proud of myself for flipping and becoming a supervisor. It's probably the 
hardest decision I ever made because I couldn't fail at it and because there's no going back, you 
know. To see, just to see how far I’ve came, you know, looking back on it, is what I'm proud 
of.  
 
VP: 
Do you feel like there was kind of some resentment from some of your coworkers that 
you went into supervision or management?  
 
MW: I was afraid there would be. I talk to almost everybody I know just to get their feelings 
on it. And old supervisors, I called a lot of people. I picked a lot of people's brains just to get 
their thoughts, to make sure I was, I thought I was doing the right thing, even though I knew, 
you know, it'd be better for me. Yeah. I talked to a lot of people just, I think maybe the two 
already knew, you know what I mean? But I just wanted to get, but there's been no resentment. 
In my whole time in maintenance, I think I only had two supervisors that actually did the job. 
And I've had supervisors that didn't know, you know, so they depended on very heavily or they 
made the wrong decision or, you know, and I wanted to, I wanted to pass my knowledge along. 
And I knew I could do more than what was, what I had.  
 
VP: 
So, do you feel like your staff are, they respect you and trust you more because you've 
done the work?  
 
MW: Yes. Yes, absolutely.  
 
VP: 
And generally is that the case in other departments as well?  
 
MW: No, no, there’s not.  
 
VP: 
Why do you think that is? 
 
MW: There's not a lot of experience in other departments like there is in maintenance. A lot 
of the guys are younger, you know, they don't have the knowledge or the experience. So, that 
kind of thing, and they kind of clash a little bit sometimes.   
11 
 
 
VP: 
So, do you think that experience is more important in maintenance, since you're 
working with this technology?  
 
MW: Um, yes and no. I mean, experience plays a big role in everything. Um, you know, if 
you have it in either, I mean, whatever department you're in, as long you have it, you can use 
it to your advantage and make the right decisions and make the right calls.  
 
VP: 
And so, do you think seniority is still important at the plant?  
 
[00:29:46] 
 
MW: Uh, yes, I do, I do. Yeah. Because you'll get a younger guy that doesn't know, you know, 
hasn't seen much. So, it's important, I think.  
 
VP: 
And so, do you think folks coming in with college degrees and stuff, they kind of come 
with particular assumptions about what they can and cannot do without the experience?  
 
MW: Um, yeah. Yeah. You know, the ongoing joke here is, you know, the three people in 
front of you tried the same thing and never worked. You know, you might think it's a new idea, 
but it's not a not a new idea, but we’ll try it anyway again. That happens, that happens quite a 
bit.  
 
VP: 
Does that cause some friction?  
 
MW: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.  
 
VP: 
How have you managed it?  
 
MW: I haven't really had to. Um, there's a lot of head butting between maintenance and 
production sometimes, I think. Because they need a certain piece of equipment, but the guys 
want to do it the right way to make it right. And you don't always have the time to make it 100 
percent. You know, sometimes you just got to get by till you have the time. That might be the 
only time I have to deal with it. But it can be, it can be very frustrating, you know. Yeah. 
 
VP: 
So, in closing our interview, is there something that I haven't asked or something that 
you would like to comment on?  
 
MW: I don't think so, I don't think so. If you don't have any other questions, I don't, I don't 
know what to say.  
 
VP: 
Well, thank you so much for your time. It's been really great to learn from your 
experience.   
 
MW: Thank you.
