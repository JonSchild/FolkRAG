29E-B[,?] Page 1. MY GAL SAL. Everything is over and I'm feeling sad, I just lost the best pal that I ever
had. 'Tis but a fortnight since she was here Seems like she has gone though for 20 years Oh, how I
miss her, my old pal, Oh, how I kiss her, my gal Sal. Face not so handsome, but eyes don't cha know
That shone just as bright as they did years ago. They call her frivolous Sal, A peculiar sort of a gal,
With a heart that 'twas mellow An all round good fellow Was my old pal. My troubles and sorrows
and cares She was always willing to share. A wild sort of devil But dead on the level Was my gal Sal.
Brought her little dainties just afore she died, Told her how I loved her ever by her side, Told her how

whispered, [goodbye?] Sal. 2 Page 2. MY GAL SAL. They call her frivolous Sal, A peculiar sort of a gal,
