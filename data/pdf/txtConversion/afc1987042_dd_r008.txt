D:  Paul Marion and Doug DeNatale are speaking with Dr. Pat Mogan.  And maybe we can begin
Dr. Mogan just by getting you to talk a little bit about your early career and how you happened to
come to Lowell in the first place.
M:  Well I think I have to go back maybe to my origins.  My father and mother were both Irish 
Immigrants.  And I lived in a community in the town of Norwood, in which in that area all of 
them were Irish.  And they virtually all of them spoke Gaelic.  There are a great number of Irish 
who, who don't speak Gaelic, and knowing the history of Ireland they could find out why.  It was
forbidden by law to speak and write in Gaelic.  And it wasn't until after the rebellion in 1921 that 
they had the Irish Free State, and was it legal again to speak the language.  So I had, I had grown 
up in a very, you might say, highly organized community as far as cultural orientation was 
concerned.  Customs and traditions were known by all, and respected by all.  And each one felt 
more or less an obligation to follow those customs and traditions.  It also was a powerful factor 
in, I was almost going to say control, but order in the, in the community.  The, virtually everyone
considered themselves part of the community.  And what one did had implications beyond ones 
family to the community itself.  So all of them felt that they had a responsibility of intervening in
behalf of the standards or the mores of the particular community.  
     To give you an example, when I was in Junior High I was, we had to walk home around two 
and a half miles to have lunch, and then we went back to school.  I used to hang around with a 
guy by the name of Dan Lydon, a fellow by the name of Dan Lydon who's father was the Chief 
of Police.  Dan was a terrific athlete, and a leader on virtually everything.  He is also very tough 
in the true sense of the word.  While we were going home Dan pulled out a cigarette and started 
to smoke it.  We went by a groups of Irish Laborers working on one of the streets, and then we 
went by.  This fellow by the name of Ned Costello walked over, took the cigarette out of his 
mouth, gave him a shot in the ass, and said, "it's a lucky thing that I caught you rather than your 
father."  Now that was typical of that, of that particular neighborhood.  Now through the years 
growing up as I did in that neighborhood, and in that particular town, I would think that anyone 
would have to be almost stupid not to feel the institutional pressure to become something other 
than you are.  To become something good.  So you had that kind of stress on the community 
between retraining their own cultural, their traditions, and the pressures put on them by the 
institutions to become something else.  So my generalization, after I looked back on it was that 
our people believed the institutions very much.  I think they were the super Americans.  They 
believed anything the institutions said.  So they consciously and willingly were able, were 
involved in killing their own culture so their kids would have a better life.  They really believed 
that.  So looking back upon it, I'm not, I'm talking about a community where everyone, all of the 
adults spoke Gaelic, I think I was in college before I realized that not one single boy or girl who 
grew up with me to my knowledge could speak Gaelic.  And that was a conscious effort on the 
part of the community.  They believed that they were doing the correct and the proper thing for 
their, their particular kids.  And so, and also through the years, and you go back, and when I 
came to Lowell I found out (--)  And oh, in my lifetime I saw that community wiped out.  I saw a
community that had a definite character to it, replaced by a homogenized nothing.  I saw a 
community that had a sense of cohesion, and coherence, replaced by a group of houses and a 
group of homes.  I also on looking back, I got the message loud and clear.  And I'm just making 
the assumption that anyone who didn't get it were stupid.  That, that to become something better, 
you had to become, you had to become something else.  And I took that, that away, but as the 
years went on and as I became more involved with other groups in all kinds of foundations, and 
all branches of higher education and everything else.  You know, gradually I was re-educated to 
believe and look  back at the life that we had and find out that many many of the things that we 
dispensed with, or did away with were far more important in the development of a person in the 
sense of a community, than we were lead to believe by the institutions that were harnessing us to 
wipe out that particular, that particular way of life.  So as the years went by, I said, we've been 
sold a bill of goods here that has been not only detrimental to us as individuals, but also 
detrimental to the country as a whole, because a way of life just didn't happen to disappear.  It 
was institutionally aided to, to disappear.  Now when I came to Lowell I found out the same type 
of thinking existing in the people's minds that existed when I was growing up in that particular 
community.  However the one thing that they had here in Lowell, they had many of the 
institutions of ethnic and cultural origin, which was still existing here.  And they seem to have a 
influence on perpetuation on a lot of the cultural traditions, even though the institutions were still
that powerful on wiping them out.
    So when I came here, I said gee, I said I hope this doesn't become another Norwood, the same 
place that I was born.  And all of this, these various ways of life that were going on here wouldn't
be, wouldn't be wiped out.  Because through the years I was, I did an awful lot of reading an 
research on it.  And I heard you know, the argument that you would here all the way down the 
line that this is America, and America was one way of life, one single way of life, and diversity 
was an impediment, and not an aid to America.  However, through all of the research that I've 
read that the prime ingredients for any kind of creativity is diversity.  And historians have 
pointed out to the middle east, through Israel and all of the whole middle east area, where some 
of the greatest progress in the world has been made, and it was made because that was the cross 
road and the interactions of the various, the various cultures.  So we're saying what we're actually
doing is wiping out that possibility, in other words, trying to get a certain amount of homogeneity
at the expense of individuality, and at the expense of creativity.  And then there was another one 
you know, it had to do more or less with learning.  That, and maybe I can sum up a lot of that 
research in just one, a couple of sentences.  If you want to have a conversation of ignorance, get 
everyone of the same background together talking.  In other words, where you never had any 
chance for any different points of view on anything, you become more rigid in your thinking, and
in your opportunities than you ever were.  You're restricting their opportunities because of that 
particular, that particular thinking.  
     So down through the years I was thinking and trying to find a way, you know, of improving 
the quality of life, because that was my work, it was education.  And I had a very broad view of, 
of education.  And the, most of my learning came from interaction with communities.  I grew up 
in a highly organized, as far as culture was concerned, Irish community.  I was dealing with 
institutions that had another frame of reference.  So my whole life has been kind of a 
comparative analysis between what I was and what they were saying I should be.  But then I 
started to start doing some analysis.  I looked at these other ways of life and I found out that they 
were lacking in many of the practices, and feelings, and attitudes that we had here, which will, 
and they were wiped out.  There was nothing comparable over here.  So it was many many years 
ago that I got the impression that, that we were systematically wiping out one of the main 
[unclear] of the American way, the American way of life.  
     Now when we come back, and say, when I was talking about my education, all of it was kind 
of a comparative.  I've considered myself from another culture.  Being educated in another 
culture and always making this analysis.  Early in my life I came to the conclusion on analyzing 
things, and I have to use a crude word to express this, that I didn't have to take the bullshit they 
were handing out.  Because there were two many things that were contradicting what they, what 
they were saying.  So what you would have to actually become would be an unthinking person, 
and go along with that.  And then I came across another thing.  I found out that some of the most 
interesting people that I've come across in live have been individuals who have had the same 
kind of cultural settings that I had, but got enough confidence, and confidence in themselves that 
they could become the individual that they once were.  
D:  Do you mean people that more or less had one foot in two different cultures.  
M:  The one foot in two different cultures, and gave up an awful lot of things to become part of 
the so called dominant culture.  After they had a certain amount of success in life, had a tendency
to revert back and start talking about the good things that once existed.  Now for example, in the 
community that I grew up, in the town of Norwood, we were all, all laborers that were there.  
And say I lived here on Adam Street, the street running parallel to it in our back yards in 
[unclear] was Railroad Avenue.  Right across in my back yard was the Conroy house.  Next to 
that was the O'Day house.  Next to that was the Conley House, and across the street from that 
was the Lyon house, and then beside that was another Lydon house.  Out of those particular 
houses, five doctors, out of that, of laboring families.  Now back quite a few, back maybe about 
ten years ago, the, they called my section Dublin, because that was the origin, the home of most 
of the people there.  Roy Lydon, who was a very successful surgeon, and was nearing retirement,
had a reunion and he called it "Dublin Day".  The theme of it was, "what it is that we had when 
we were kids that we never put a value on when we were kids, and we now have lost.  And how 
can we restore it."  Now these were all professional people that were doing that, and it was after 
an awful lot of thought.  So now we came down the field, say to, (--)
     Then there was another generalization that I used for a long time.  Education, I was just 
looking at some statistics the other day.  Out of one year, a person spends just, they spend, for 
every hour they spend in school, they spend five hours of their awakening time outside of the 
school.  I'm not talking about the sleeping time.  So your influence on a person, your school is 
not that major influence.  Your school as I found out was a instructional agency that was many 
times trying to make us into something else.  And it wasn't a learning institution.  But what I'm 
saying is that your other five hours, if you had any kind of an analytical mind was your, was your
learning set up.  So when, when the Coleman Report, and your equality of educational 
opportunity came out, that particular report, and this is my analysis of it now, was saying that the
schools, as presently organized were only a 20% factor in a person's achievements.  In your 
home, in your neighborhood, in your peers, and what you thought of them were actually an 80% 
factor.  
P:  You talked about your experience as a reading teacher in Lowell, and how you came to see 
that the lack of retention.  You know, you would say you'd come back the next year and it was 
like I didn't, what did I even teach these kids.  But then you, you traced it back to their kind of 
self esteem, I mean their attitude.  
M:  Well yes, I, well I consider myself a reading expert.  And I was able to take the kids who 
weren't having too much successive reading, and I'd bring them to a certain level, a good level.  
And they had an awful lot of pride in what they had done.  And awful lot of confidence.  Then I 
would see them about five years later, and it was just as if the expert never existed.  They went 
back into their previous, their previous pattern.  So then I started to re-analyze an awful lot of the
research.  And so I became thoroughly convinced that the schools as presently organized were 
only about a 20% factor.  And you home, and your neighborhood, and your peers, were the 80% 
factor.  Now your difficulty on that was, that some of your people lived, the 80% factor was a 
negative one, and some people lived where the 80% factor was a positive one.  So no matter 
what I did in the schools as presently organized, if I only address the instruction, and 
concentrated only on the 20% factor, and did nothing at all with the 80% factor, no matter what I 
did in the schools could be negated by the 80% factor.  So then, and that's what I said, the 80% 
factor in Lowell was that we were an ethnic community.
P:  Is that when it hit you?  The multi cultural city could be this educational laboratory?
M:  Yes!  Then it's said, (--)  Well what you had to do was, when we looked at that we found out, 
there's an awful lot of research.  And one of them, I just summarize it by one individual and the 
sayings that they have.  One of them said, people who don't have any past don't have any future.  
And so the, so what you had was  people from ethnic communities were generally alienated and 
became disassociated by your institutions which were trying to make them something else.  So in
other words they didn't have any positive background.  Some of the went to the extent of 
changing their names to hide their identity.  Some of them changes their religion to hide their 
origin.  So what we were looking at was a school operating in an environment where most of the 
kids in that were coming from the 80% factor which was considered negative.  Like we were an 
industrial and an ethnic city.  And your conventional wisdom said you should shun both of those,
there was no value in those.  You should become something else.  The city should become 
something else.  So what we had to do was to look into what our composition was, and what our 
city was, and find out if there was any positive thread upon which we could give a decent future, 
and a decent chance to our kids.  I believed it was so important that if we couldn't find one of any
substance we would have to concoct one.  And you know, the old public relations idea.  And well
fortunately on looking into it we found out that Lowell was a living exhibit of the process and the
consequences of the American Industrial Revolution.  Not only was this, and this, what we were 
was a very important part of the the story of the United States.  So we had no reason to, to 
consider our background and what we were as negative.  We had every reason to look at it as 
positive.  
     Now that was all right for me to know, and it was all right for an awful lot of other people in 
the community to know, but remember, these people in our, people by our institutions, and by 
you know, an awful lot of current [elise?] and ideologies, that they had to become something 
else.  Now the only way we could do that, and we found out that you know, we had this proud 
background that we should share and present and preserve, but it wasn't enough for us to know 
that.  We had to have some kind of affirmation and reassurance given to us.  And the only way 
that could be done would be having people of your caliber and others making Lowell a 
destination, which would be giving affirmation to it.  So we came up with the Parks as a means 
to attain that end, and the parks were never an end in itself.  And, but we were providing the park
system with something of value, and something of value, something of value to the country.  We 
never apologized for what we were.  We said what we were and are is important, and is part of 
that story which should be perpetuated for future generations.  Now as I went on I kept on 
getting more assurance with it by certain people I talked to.  Like one of the, most of your history
of United States is the history of big events like wars.  (P:  Elections and wars)  Wars and 
elections and things like that.  But hardly any of it is of the people.  But there was a movement in
American History called American studies, which started to look upon what was happening 
while these big events were going on, and how did they influence the course of history.  Well one
of the leaders in that American Study movement was the president of Amherst College, John 
William Ward.  And John William Ward gave me, or Amherst to John William Ward, gave me an 
Honorary Degree.  And I asked him why they were doing it.  And he said, I believe the history of
the United States is very closely associated with the way we're able to deal with cities.  And he 
said, we have always been dealing with them in some kind of a negative and pathological way.  
He said, what you people have started was the first movement that I know of any substance to 
deal with the cities in a positive way.  And he said, and I think it's going to have terrific 
implications for, for the United States.  Well that was only one, but (--)
P:  When was that?  That was around 1980 Pat?
M:  That was '75.
P:  Oh, '75?  
M:  Before that, before '75.  I got the Degree in '75, the Honorary Degree from Amherst.  
P:  Oh, U Lowell, U Lowell was later.  
M:  U Lowell was the same year.  
P:  Oh, oh okay.
M:  It was the same, it was the same year.  
P:  Okay.
M:  And uh, so, so, so as we went along with, as I you know, went and talked to different groups,
and I say I always approach them.  I said, I'm not coming as a poor cousin.  I'm coming offering 
something of value.  Value to the country, and value to individuals, and groups of individuals.  
And so my job is more of making you aware of what we have, because we're not asking for 
anything.  We're asking for you to help preserve and perpetuate what is a good thing for the 
country.  And so most of them, not having much, who only could tell you anything, only could 
tell you negative things about the city, didn't know any of the positive things about the city, so I 
had an upper hand on most of them.  And I never ran into any difficulty with the most 
sophisticators of panels and you know, historians and everything that I, I was with.  
D:  Back at that point when it was a period when Lowell was generally viewed as being in a real 
slump and all of that, you were coming out and presenting a positive image of Lowell.  What 
were you saying to those people?  What were you pointing too in Lowell that (--)
M:  All right.  What, to give you an example, one of the things that you needed was a 
constituency or a mechanism to carry out the thing.  What we were talking about was too much 
for any single institution like education to do alone.  It was bigger than any one of them, just like 
the park we had was bigger than anyone.  And when we had, we had a very very astute, and I 
consider very very intelligent Congressman by the name of Brad Morris.  And when we were 
presenting this idea (--)
D:  This was in the early 70's, late 60's?
M:  Late 60's.  
D:  Late 60's.  '68 and '69. 
M:  And '70.  And '68, right down through there.  When we were presenting the idea in 
Washington, we knew it was greater than any agency that existed, and couldn't be done by any 
one of them because of the way they operated.  So Brad Morris was a Republican who had 
terrific influence with Republicans and Democrats and with the Democratic White House.  And 
he started what they called a Tuesday morning club that had all of the liberal Republicans to get 
it.  So he was more than just an individual.  He was a leader of that group.  And president sought 
him out for that particular reason.  So what Brad Morse did, we had a meeting in Washington, he 
got representatives, a high representative of every single department in Washington in one room. 
About forty of them.  And he addressed them in this way.  He said, gentlemen, he said, I'm going 
to present something to you.  A concept for the cities that is beyond the ability of the mandate of 
any one of your single departments to do.  But collectively each of you can do a part of it, which 
can give you a bigger bang for your dollar than you ever got before.  And we presented the thing 
to them, and that's how (--)  In fact we did have, when we, we came up we knew that we had to 
come in with, we had an interdisciplinary plan with governments which were organized to deal 
with disciplines.  So we came up with the plan under the Model Cities of Progress Through 
Education.  We're talking about progress on your whole way of life.  We're not talking about just 
on education.  So now we come back and I said (--)
