The Folk Arts Progiam at the National Endowment for the Ar
 
devotes its entire budget
• the encouragement
 
highest
 
How do
. we approach this task?
 First we help to present the
 
traditional arts of our multi-cultural peoples in living performance.
 
Our live presentations include helping with the costs of 
festivals
 
of all types and sizes,  from a Portuguese festa in a small Nevada
 
township
 
 Portuguese-Americans hav_  been living for
 
to the large National Folk
• 
•  
We also assist
 
with concert series of traditional musics and dance,  presentations
 
by local
.•
 •nal artisans,  craftsworkers,  and musicians in the
 
public schools,  and special exhibits that might appear in local
 
museums or perhaps tour through
• _ state or region.
•
 ur
 
apprenticeship program encourages the very most experienced of •
 
minority,
ur  
folk artists and artisans to pass their skills along to local young
 
people.
 And finally, we support
' tours by specially assembled
 
performing units,-many of which represent a single ethnic 
 
such as 
- Green Fields of 
America",  the extremely successful
 
Irish-American perfo
 been enthusiastically
 
rmance unit that has

•  •
communities in cities across 
the country.
 
highest
We also encourage the documentation of folk artistic per-
formances through the media.
 We do this first,  in order to pre-
sent these arts in their 
•
 • the widest possible
 
audience;  second,  in order to preserve them for the benefit of
 
future generations.
 Media projects include films,  such as a
 
recent highly successful film on the tradition of black tap
 
dancing,  video programs for local and national distribution,  radio
 
broadcast series, phonograph records,  and still photographs.

There are many ways to analyze the impact of our program.
 
One is by geographical disLribuLion.
 We hava funded folk arts
 
projects,  now,  in every state of the union as well as in Micronesia
 
and the Virgin Islands.
 
Our ethnic distribution presents an interesting pattern.
 
More than one half of Folk Arts'  grants cover multi-ethnic
 
activities of every sort and description.
 Of those that go to
 
single cultural groups,  approximately one-fourth go to European-
Americans  (
Polish,  Italian, Greek,  Irish, Turks, Jewish,
 
Scandinavian, Basque,  etc.,  etc.  exclusive of Hispanics).
 Pro-
jects to highlight and support Appalachian and Ozark traditional
 
culture take up another one-fourth.
 The third quarter of our
 
budget is divided pretty equally between Black and Hispanic
 
projects;  the remainder goes to Native Americans and a small
 
fraction to assist Asian-Americans.
 
On the whole, we are pleased with this distribution.
 The
 
most obvious imbalances include over-attention to the Anglo
 
folkloric work has been done that the people
 
of the value of their cultural heritage and
 
At the other end of the distribution scale,
 
paid to Asian-Americans is explainable by
 
by these people during World War II.
 They
 
simply do not request federal assistance,  having,  from their
 
own point of view,  good reason to avoid notice by the federal
 
government.
 Folk Arts has been working on this problem and
 
intends to keep on doing so.
 One of our current efforts is to
 
develop,  in conjunction with other Arts Endowment Programs,  a
 
program for the support of Asian high arts music,  theater and
 
dance.
 
South, where so much
 
are highly conscious
 
demand its support.
 
the slight attention
 
the traumas suffered
 
It might be of particular interest to point out that a
 
generous one-third of our funding goes to those small ethnic
 
and regional communities that exist in our vast urban complexes.
 
(
There are lots of folks in the cities.)
 The remaining two-
thirds goes to small towns,  rural areas, Native American
 
reservations and the like.
 
The Folk Arts Program is small,  energetic,  and fast-moving.
 
We are particularly proud of our record in helping develop
 
activities that are self-sustaining.
 We like to help get some-
thing nice started in a community and then move on,  leaving the
 
community to decide whether or not they wish to continue it,
 
since the on-going costs will be small.
 We might help a Hungarian
 
parish in Cleveland revive their treasured grape festival,  or

give Navajo elders transportation to a local Head Start Center
 
in ordor to aducato tho childron in traditional Navajo songs and
 
dances, or support the inclusion of old-time Black quilters and
 
iron-workers in a crafts fair.
 In all these cases, a single
 
small federal grant resulted in on-going projects supported by
 
the communities themselves.  We work with the knowledge that
 
federal recognition of grass-roots culture can have startingly
 
positive results in raising community morale; we have seen it
 
happen.  And there are lots more folks out there to be helped.

INTRODUCTI ON
 
T
he National Heritage Fellowship Program has been i
n f
ormal existence
 
s
ince 1982, but i
t
s p
lanning began a
 good f
ive years before t
hat. Perhaps i
t
 
would be helpful t

, put t
hat way
, but i
t
 a
l
l
 
t
ook a
 r
emarkable amount o
f doing, and only a
 s
ketchy outline o
f t
he h
istory
 
o
f t

. I
 apologize i
n advance f
or t
he many names t
hat
 
must be omitted i
n deference t
o c

f t

I
t was during my very f
i
rst c
onversation w
ith Nancy Hanks, t
hen
 
Chairman o
f t
he National Endowment f
or t
he Arts, where I
 s
tarted working
 
i
n 1977, t

he t

hought t
he Arts Endowment ought t

t t
he t
ime, I
 was not s
o s

ater I
 d
id l
ook i
nto how
 
t
he s
ystem worked i
n Japan and I
 was deeply impressed, even deeply moved,
 
by what I
 f
ound.
 
One immediately noteworthy f
act was t
hat t
he Japanese p
rogram had
 
g
rown out o
f a
 l
ong-standing and extremely s
erious ef
fort on t
he part o
f t
he
 
Japanese people t
o p
rotect t
heir cultural heritage. As early a
s 1950,
 
c
enturies-old l
ocal r
egulations o
f various t
ypes had been c
onsolidated i
nto
 
a
 r
emarkable p

hrough s

behaviours a

t t

an s

hat we
 
haven't had much p

rand-new s

f

A s
econd p
roblem s
temmed f
rom t
he vast d
ifferences between t
he
 
h
istories o
f t
he two nations. During t
he l
ast o
f t
he period o
f
 Japanese
 
i
solationism, t
he United S

aking t
he opposite c
ourse: encouraging

at l

f
rom c

f t

o a
s t
o i

orce.
 
Some people here worried t
hat s
uch l
arge numbers o
f newly a

immigrant peoples, c
omplete w
ith t
heir own cultural pasts and p
resents,
 
might d
ilute o
r even r
adically a

he national character
. There was,
 
however
, a
lmost immediate a
cceptance o
f t
he c
omforting hypothesis t
hat
 
t
here existed a
 national "melting pot" —an enormous and a
ll-encompassing
 
c
rucible i
nto which a
l
l c
ontending a
rtistic and cultural t
raditions would
 
c
ontentedly d
issolve t
o emerge a
s t
rue-blue American (
though r
etaining t

O

olor and charm). The s
low but s
teady abandonment o

specially i
nterested i

ther words, f

Even c

he f
ormidable p
roblems j
ust mentioned, t
he Important
 
I
ntangible Cultural Properties i
dea c
ontinued t
o exert a
 f
undamental appeal.
 
Most people j

t
 r
efused t

n t
he l
ate
 
s

Today

ot o

hings —some on
 
t
he down s
ide and s
ome on t

earned not t
o worry t
oo much
 
about l
ocal j
ealousies being a
roused by t
he Fellowships. There may have
 
been hard f
eelings i
n a
 f
ew c
ases, but nothing t
hat we've heard o
f s
o f
ar has
 
c
aused r
eal c
oncern. Most t
raditional a

 have known s
eem t
o r
ejoice
 
when t

omorrow i

And maybe i
t
 will. One o
f t
he n
ice t
hings about t
he National Heritage
 
Fellowships i
s
 t
hat t
hey a
re s
tructured s
o a
s t
o i
nclude any number o
f
 
s
ignif

n a
 s

s
 no r
eason, f
or example, why a
 
d
if
ferent f
iddler c
andot be named every year; t
here a
re c
ertainly an i
nf
inity
 
o
f s
uperlative f
iddlers s
pread about over t
he American l
andscape.
 
Some t
hings have t
urned out unexpectedly
. We had i
nitially believed t
hat
 
i
f
 t
he f
i
rst g
roup o
f Fellowship holders p
resented a
 c
ross s
ection o
f t
he
 
American cultural s
urround, t
hen i
n f
uture years an imbalance would not be
 
noticeable —that we c
ould r
ecognize t
en quilters f
rom t
he Midwest, f
or
 
example, and no one would c
are. We had not r
ealized how v
isible t
he entire
 
p
rogram would be, how deeply people would come t
o c
are t
hat t
heir
 
particular t
radition, t
heir part o
f t
he nation, t
heir e
thnicity
, t
heir s
ex, t
heir
 
r
eligion, l
anguage, o
r o
ccupation, be i
ncluded. We a
lso l
earned t
hat t
he f
i
rst
 
r
epresentation o
f any g
roup i
n t
he Heritage program has a
 s
pecial
 
s
ignif
icance. Many Hawaiians t
old u
s, f
or exa mple, t
hat t
heir c
lassic hula
 
t
radition s
hould be r
ecognized f
i
rst, s
ince i
t
 has a
 particularly deep meaning
 
f
or Hawaiians, and t
hat a
fterward i
t
 would be f
ine t
o honor s
uch imported
 
t
raditions a
s quilting, but t
he hula must c
ome f
i
rst. And s
o i
t
 d
id; one o
f t
he
 
most s
enior t
raditional kumu hulas (
hula masters) was nominated, and Mrs.
 
Emily Kau'i Zuttermeister r
eceived a
 National Heritage Fellowship i
n 1984.
 
We a
lso l
earned t
o c
onsider each year s
ome qualities we had not t
hought
 
necessary t
o r
epresent a
t f
i
rst. One, i
ronically
, has t
o do with s
uccess. The
 
emotional impact o
f t
he entire Fellowship p
resentation i
s
 s
o g
reat t
hat we
 
d
iscovered many people had developed t
he s
entimental notion t
hat every
 
t
raditional a
rtist had been d
iscovered l
anguishing i
n an obscure c
orner
 
s
omewhere, neglected and despised, until t
he g
reat Folk Arts Program had
 
c
ome a
long. Each year
, t
herefore, t
he panel t
r
ies t
o r
ecommend one o
r more
 
t
raditional a
rtists who have done very well i
ndeed i
n t
he mainstream o
f t
he
 
a
rts —a world-famous b
luegrass s
inger l
ike Bill Monroe, f
or example, o
r a
 
decoy c
arver l
ike Lem Ward, whose s
culpted b
irds bring t
housands o
f dollars
 
apiece f
rom f
anciers a
cross t
he nation. The panel a
lso l
ikes t
o i
nclude an
 
example o
f an a
rtist whose work i
s
 outstanding but who has not yet r
eached
 
a
 venerable age, s
omeone, perhaps, l
ike t
he extraordinary I
r
ish s
tep dancer
 
Michael F
latley
.
 
We c
ontinue t
o t
inker with t
he s
ystem; we ma
yor possibly may not —
 
have a
 l
ong way t
o g
o. Mostly we t
ry t
o keep a
s f
lexible a
s t
he American
 
a
rtistic s
cene i
s
. Nominations a
re now made f
or t
he l
i
fetime o
f t
he artist.
 
Once nominated, t
he work o
f every a
rtist i
s
 examined r
egularly by t
he
 
advisory panel. This i
s
 partly t
o c
onserve work but mostly because each year
 
t
here a
re many more worthy nominees t
han we c
an r
ecognize and because
 
f
uture panels may p
roperly wish t
o a
lter both t
he guidelines and t
he c
riteria
 
f
or t

We have c
ome t

egally g
ive a

o t

adly f
ind t

For t

id
 
not s

rom anyone's brow; t

even dubiously s

STATE OF THE ARTS
 FOLK ARTS
 
INTRODUCTION 
In the following discussion, the term "folk art" will be
 
used as it has been used consistently throughout the Endowment's
 
history:
 to indicate the multi-disciplinary aesthetic
 
contributions of small groups within the larger body politic,
 
groups that define themselves as separate and worthy of note due
 
to factors of national origin,  language, occupation,  religion,
 
place of residence and other distinguishing factors.
 Their
 
artistic creations typically serve to identify and celebrate the
 
group rather more than the individual artist; examples such as
 
cowboy songs, Sioux porcupine quill work, Hawaiian hula dances,
 
Hungarian embroidery, Delta blues come quickly to mind.
 
In such traditions, the learning of an art form tends to take
 
place informally within families or community-based institutions
 
such as churches.
 It is generally based on a one-to-one
 
interaction, with the senior craftsman or artist typically
 
setting both the standards and the example which the learner is
 
expected to "pick up" or imitate.
 The ability to produce
 
artistically interesting effects within the well-defined
 
boundaries of a single aesthetic style is of
 
p
primary
 
importance.
 Therefore, the learner must devebp not only
 
technical competence but a deep and intense familiarity with the
 
aesthetic characteristics of the particular style of art being
 
learned )Pueblo pottery.as opposed to Appalachian stoneware, for
 
example).
 
There are very few institutions dedicated completely to the
 
preservation and presentation of folk arts. l
Fo -e
xample, the
 
Endowment's Folk Arts Program gave grants to
-15 such
 J
 
institutions in 1987.
 Folk arts tend to be practiced with
 
dedication and intensity and aesthetic opininions are taken
 
seriously within ra folk community;  still,  relatively few folk
 y
 
artists attempt to support themselves by practicing their art
 
form full-time.
 
The broad reach of folk arts,  as heretofore defined,  suggests a
 
possible special susceptibility to broad alterations in the
 
course of public life.
 The past half-century has seen enormous
 
social, political, economic and cultural changes which have
 
affected the folk arts.
 The following outline sketches some of
 
the major factors.
 
ti
 
MOBILITY.
 The highway system and the automobile have
 
vastly increased surface mobility, breaking down the isolation
 
of small communities where traditional arts historically
 
flourish.
 At the same time,  inexpensive air transport allows
 
free-flowing access to home communities,  and we see European and
 
Asian immigrants keeping in closer touch with their old-world
 
art forms.
 
DECREASE OF MULTI-GENERATIONAL CONTACT.
 Today, the typical
 
American life history requires multiple relocations during a
 
lifetime.
 Such relocations generally include only the nuclear
 
family,  leaving grandparents physically isolated from their
 
younger descendants.
 Traditional arts and values have always
 
passed from grandparents to children,  (skipping the parents who
 
are typically occupied with economic activity).
 Separation of
 
generations has disrupted this age-old instructional system.
 At
 
the same time, multiple-generational institutions have declined,
 
leaving the church as one of the few institutions providing
 
frequent casual contact between seniors and children.
 
CENTRALIZED AND UNI-DIRECTIONAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEM.
 
Increasing centralization of films, television,  recording
 
companies, newspapers, magazines and book publishing makes for
 
greater economic efficiency but an ever louder message as the
 
big centers grow bigger and the competition becomes feebler.
 
Attention by the media has become a metaphor for actual
 
existence.
 If you're not represented on the screen, you are not
 
worth paying attention to and therefore you're not there at
 
all.
 Since the movement of information is,  for economic
 
reasons,  from the center to the periphery, the voices of smaller
 
or rural communities have become ever weaker.
 At the same time,
 
increased media availability has allowed for ever greater
 
exposure of the general public to more and more information
 
(though from the point of view of a broad representation of
 
artistic styles,  about less and less).
 
CONSUMERISM.
 Success is so often measured in dollars.
 Younger
 
artists expect large cash returns for their efforts and thus are
 
less interested in learning the older somewhat slower-producing
 
art forms, whether it be the intricate double-woven patterns of
 
a Chitimacha Indian basket or the elegant,  lilting melodies of
 
Southeast Missouri fiddle music.
 At the same time,  older
 
artists may be diverted into attempts to win quick popularity by
 
hitting upon some quick-money product.
 Historically, the
 
traditional arts have never been immune to the demands of the
 
market, but in earlier times they have tended to be affected
 
more tangentially,  less hysterically, by the demands of the
 
purchaser/consumer.
 
i
 
NEW TECHNOLOGY FOR ARTISTIC DUPLICATION.
 The invention of the
 
recording machine has made it possible for the first time in the
 
history of mankind to hear an exact repetition of a musical or
 
speech performance.
 This has had a profound effect upon the
 
development of folk music, vastly increasing technical
 
virtuosity and spreading the musical systems of many cultural
 
groups far beyond their usual audiences.
 At the same time the
 
development of the recording industry as an industry invested
 
much greater power of aesthetic persuasion in the hands of a
 
few.
 A similar revolution in the visual media took place with
 
the invention of the camera and the movie camera.
 These
 
technological revolutions -- as powerful and mind-altering as
 
the invention of the printing press -- have all taken place
 
within the last century.
 
LONGEVITY, SPEED AND FUTURE SHOCK.
 While the general life
 
expectancy has lengthened, the rate of social/cultural change
 
has increased during the past half century and appears to be
 
increasing more.
 Older people have thereby been required,
 
during their life spans, to absorb and to learn to cope with
 
more innovations than any previous generation.
 This seems to be
 
producing a race in two directions simultaneously -- towards
 
stability,  in terms of older familiar and conservative art forms
 
on the one hand, and towards the development of more complex
 
innovative art forms on the other.
 This is probably normal, but
 
somehow the rate seems faster and the movement more intense.
 
It is difficult to remember a serious discussion of the state of
 
folk arts that did not picture the field as on its last legs.
 
This somber mood seems to be endemic to the topic; traditions
 
are always seen to be fading, gasping, on their deathbeds.
 This
 
is true, but it is not the whole truth.
 Aesthetic systems turn
 
out to be exceptionally,tough and enduring;  stylistic features
 
are extremely hard to exterminate; melodies leap national
 
boundaries;  spatial patterns survive enormous changes whether of
 
building materials or the size of structures.
 
At any moment in time,  some artistic traditions will be fading
 
out,  some will be preparing to fade back in under a new
 
disguise,  some will be blooming with health and spawning new
 
forms and ideas.
 At the next moment in time, the overall scene
 
will be the same, but the particular forms affected will be
 
different.
 The arts of the folk are like the folk artists
 
themselves:
 easy to discourage but exceptionally hard to kill
 
off,  for they respond a hundred-fold to the least bit of
 
well-analyzed counsel, to the sunshine of simple exposure, to
 
the approval of strangers as well as friends, to the empowerment
 
of historical and technical information, to a living wage.
 Some
 
of the issues that folk artists themselves face are discussed
 
here.
 
I
.
 ARTISTRY
 
Even well-known folk performing artists rarely work in
 
situations where even union minimum rates apply.
 Craft artisans
 
typically produce objects that require major investments of
 
time.
 They then underprice the item,  since the notion that they
 
should receive a minimum hourly wage for their work is an
 
unfamiliar idea.
 Older artists fear that any even insignificant
 
earnings may put their pensions,  social security payments or tax
 
category into jeopardy, threatening them with the loss of
 
resources they depend upon.
 This tends to discourage them from
 
practicing their art in a professional context, not only keeping
 
them off the market but hindering the informal learning between
 
senior and junior artists so essential to the preservation of
 
folk arts.
 In folk arts, part time work is the norm;  full-time
 
practicing folk artists are the rarity.
 
Certain traditional arts have never entered the economic system
 
(e.g.  religious music and community activities for which no one
  
receives remuneration).
 Further,  some traditional arts have
 
historically been self-supporting and have built and maintained
 
their own support network (such as local markets for the
 
consumption of handmade Southern pottery or a Polish-American
 
dance circuit in Chicago).
 But the decrease of
 
mutli-generational contact,  and the increase of mobility,  as
 
noted earlier, have endangered these home-grown systems..
 
Artistry in the folk arts often depends upon the availability of
 
the raw materials out of which the artistic process has
 
evolved.
 Ash, willow, oak and palm have different handling
 
qualities and aesthetic possibilities; musical instruments vary
 
in part because of the different materials used to construct
 
sounding boards,  resonating chambers and playing surfaces. A
 
forced change of material due to environmental or economic
 
changes can alter or limit the range of solutions available to
 
the artist, changing the entire palette.
 All artists produce
 
within these constraints but folk artists, working from age-old
 
traditions are often cast adrift aesthetically when normal
 
working materials are absent; they tend to grab for the next
 
practical model,  losing,  in the process, their own aesthetic
 
spine.
 
Artistic creativity is of course sometimes actually engendered 
by the need to overcome limitations.
 In many traditional arts,
 
though, traditional solutions to artistic and technological
 
problems are in themselves time-tested and valuable and should
 
not be forgotten or abandoned no matter how "creative" it might
 
seem to work out new ways.
 
Raw materials are not the only scarce resource
 The standards
 
of quality in an art form must be learned by frequent exposure
 
to the best possible examples of the art.
 Many folk artists,
 
however, rarely see or hear the entire range of melodic
 
invention or design that their art form embodies.
 The greatest
 
collections of Pacific and American Indian art lie in European
 
museums.
 University music libraries typically contain more
 
recordings of Appalachian folk performance than are available in
 
the radio stations or record stores of any Kentucky town.
 The
 
documentation is incomplete, but the distribution is even worse.
 
The absence of key virtuoso recorded performances or examples of
 
extraordinary visual designs may, of course, open the
 
possibility of a vacuum into which new talent and ideas can
 
grow;  on balance, though, this is a dangerous situation,
 
considering all the reasons for talented youngsters not to learn
 
a folk tradition.
 
Compounding this problem is the flood of industrially produced
 
imitations of folk art.
 Consumers often do not recognize
 
genuine folk artistry when they see it.
 Throughout history,
 
elite and popular artists have co-opted designs,  styles,
 
melodies,  stories,  and poetry from folk artists,  freely and
 
without thouqht of recompense. 
The free adaptation of
 
traditional quilt patterns by manufacturers of fabrics or
 
patterned oil-cloth is one end of a continuum that ends with the
 
importation by American gift shops from Korea of genuine
 
imitation Pueblo jewelry.
 The fact that these poor-quality
 
substitutions reduce the market possibilities for genuine and
 
authentic artisans rarely occurs to anyone.
 
Many such substitutions are provided for the tourist market;
 
some tribal groups and local folk artisans are producing their
 
own "tourist art" with some degree of marketing success.
 In the
 
meantime, the acquisition of even imitation folk art represents
 
an attempt on the part o.f the consumer to buy into a variation
 
of the larger aesthetic system, to identify in some way with
 
another bunch of people with a different view of the world.
 
This perhaps is as much as we can ask for sometimes.
 
 
I
 
Authentic folk artists acquire their knowledge and skills
 
through painstaking obsvervation of more accomplished artists
 
over an extended period of time.
 Competition for time and money
 
makes apprenticeships less attractive to many potential
 
learners.
 Others,  however,  are drawn to apprenticing because of
 
the attraction of a one-on-one teacher/learner relationship and
 
the desire to ascertain and strengthen cultural identity.
 The
 
increasing number of apprenticeship programs indicates the
 
st
 g h o
 f-�
e fund-Enbntal p
rise.
 It begins even to seem
 
ossible that one of the factor s -responsible for the general
 
health of Native American art forms is that American Indian
 
society itself places its highest v
)alue on the concept of
 
learning from your elders.
 This
 
simple concept -- the joining
 
together of a person who really wants to pass a tradition on and
 
a person who really wants to r
�eive it -- may prove to be the
 
most lasting stratagem o
.
 
FINANCING
 
It is extremely difficult to analyze folk arts support.
 A great
 
deal of activity is self-sustaining,  either because the cash
 
requirements are minimal or because ordinary gate receipts or
 
payment for one craft object is sufficient.
 The lack of
 
institutions in this field means that few mechanisms exist for
 
bringing private sector contributions -- whether corporate,
 
foundation,  or individual -- to the folk arts field.
 Government
 
support,  therefore, has been a relatively visible,  and therefore
 
relatively important,  source of subsidy.____
_
.______
 
The federal government support eth
 folk arts field in several
 
ways.
 The Folk Arts
-Program at the National Endowment for the
 
Arts offers grant support for projects in the folk arts and for
 
the development of a support network in the public sector.
 The
 
National Endowment from the Humanities,  through various of its
 
categories of support,  funds projects that study and interpret
 
the folk arts.
 The Office of Folklife Programs of the
 
Smithsonian Institution includes the folk arts in its
 
documentation and presentation of American folklife through
 
publications,  the electronic media,  and public events such as
 
the annual Festival of American Folklife.
 The American Folklife
 
Center at the Library of Congress lends greater visibility and
 
accessibility to the Folk Arts through publications such as
 
American Folk Music and Folklore Recordings 1986: A Selected
 
List and through its Archive of Folk Culture.
 
7
 
 
I
 
The Arts Endowment, with a budget for the Folk Arts Program of
 
about $3 million, has selected a strategy of working with state
 
arts agencies to develop a national public funding base for folk
 
arts projects.
 The allocations of state government funding for
 
the folk arts now equal or exceed the Endowment's budget for
 
folk arts.
 A 1986 study supported b
y the Folk Arts Program
 
discovered that thirty-one state cultural programs spent a total
 
of $3.9 million for folk arts activities in 1984 versus $3.6
 
million in 1983).
 This figure represents a minimum for the
 
states because not all states participated in the study.
 This
 
figure includes administrative expenditures (e.g.  salaries of
 
folk arts coordinators) and covers the expenditures of folklife
 
bureaus, state historical societies,  and state university-based
 
programs as well as state arts agencies; when state arts
 
agencies alone are considered, the total was $
  million.
 (
It
 
should be noted that these state expenditures include some
 
federal dollars which flow through the state agency;  in 1984,
 
federal funds accounted for 17% of these funds.)
 
Increasingly,  state agencies have shown interest in supporting
 
the folk arts.
 In 1978, eight states had folk cultural
 
programs; by 1988, that number had grown to 47 of the 56 total
 
states and special jurisdictions.
 These state agencies expend
 
their folk arts funds toward a wide variety of activities,
 
including apprenticeships, concerts,  festivals,
 
folk-artists-in-education, touring, media productions, artist
 
conferences,  and fieldwork.
 
A growing phenomenon has been the increased attention to the
 
folk arts given by local arts agencies.
 Some are doing so
 
through grants.
 A 1987 survey of local arts agencies (
in which
 
308 organizations responded)  indicated that 11% of the 187
 
grant-making agencies gave folk arts grants.
 Funding
 
was,however, modest:
 $94,428, or less than 1% of the total
 
grants funds distributed by these agencies.
 But local arts
 
agencies support the folk arts in other ways.
 Certain agencies
 
have on staff local folk arts coordinator.
 Others play an
 
important collaborative role in presenting the folk arts.
 
I
 
III.
 ACCESS/AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION
 
Folk arts activities range from demonstrations by local
 
craftsmen in country schoolrooms to major exhibits in the
 
largest museums of our major cities,
. from the tribal ceremonial
 
dance in Idaho to a full-length film on Black gospel music to be
 
screened in first-run movie theatres across the country.
 While
 
we have no survey data on the audiences for the folk arts, the
 
very nature of the field suggests their variety -- grown-ups and
 
children, rural and urban, poor and wealthy, men and women,
 
white collar and blue.
 These include audiences who are members
 
of the cultural tradition of the art being presented and those
 
who are not.
 
Given the flood of industrially produced replicas of folk art
 
and imitative interpreters of folk music and dance, the capacity
 
of the general public to discern and appreciate au(hentic -
-
'
 
traditional art is  major concern.
 Indeed,  in a study of folk
 
craft artists, manylof these artists expressed concern over a
 
lack of public exposure
 traditional work and a lack of
 
appreciation of fine  av .crafted work.
 Audiences within a 
community
-
.
.
.may have s c  a capacity; much of the general public
 
does not.
 
And yet, getting such work into the hands of the broader public
 
is no easy task.
 The scale of production required to inte
r
 
commercial distributors leaves the small scale of
 
ore folk arts
 
scrambling for support.
 The size of the market re 7l—red to
 
interest investors is simply too large;  and the lack of a
 
sizeable percentage of the GNP going into the support of
 
traditional arts itself precludes further development.
 
(Parenthetically, this is why folk arts does better when it
 
aligns itself with the elite arts:
 in a commercial art gallery,
 
the economic and aesthetic positions of the Pueblo potter and
 
the miminalist painter are more alike than different;  in the
 
concert hall, the Delta bluesman and the solo recitalist have
 
equal potential to thrill and delight their audiences.)  Folk
 
arts generally thrive in small venues, but even middle sized
 
markets are now being wiped out.
 (For example, Spanish language
 
programs on television and radio are in trouble across the
 
country.)
 
The traditional performing arts may be on the brink of "breaking
 
into" a network of presenting organizations interested in
 
broadening the diversity of their programs through the
 
presentation of authentic folk dancers, musicians,  and other
 
artists appropriate to the theatre,.such as storytellers.
 This
 
will require a corps of presenters knowledgeable about these
 
forms,  and this in itself presents a challenge.
 If, however,  a
 
committed group of "mainstream'' presenters were to engage more
 
actively in presenting traditional folk artists, the access of
 
the general public to these arts would be greatly enhanced.
 
Traditional arts lack general access to the media; this applies
 
to the making of records, the broadcast of music over radio, the
 
production and scheduling  of traditional artists through
 
television and films, and the publication of songbooks, poetry
 
collections,  stories, etc.
 The pressure for big markets and big
 
audiences has left local radio stations, concert presenters and
 
small museums fighting for the occasional "big time" event.
 The
 
mixing up and dilution of communities through increased mobility
 
produces smaller audiences for local traditional events and
 
smaller markets for local productions.
 The value system that
 
until recently says that only the elite arts must have intensive
 
exposure (and its consequent economic clout) continues to
 
eliminate the smaller artistic systems from media exposure even
 
in the smaller places.
 The former trend towards development of
 
local media producers (such as Appalshop) has slowed because of
 
economic stress;  some still survive but -- more importantly --
few are being added.
 
IV. APPRECIATION/ARTS EDUCATION
 
While Toward Civilization has shed new l
ight on arts education,
 
very little is known about the teaching of folk arts in
 
schools.
 Our sense is that the average school child is given no
 
information on art forms of cultures other than those of western
 
Europe,  if indeed he or she gets that much.
 A child in Los
 
Angeles learns little or nothing of the arts of Mexico or Spain,
 
nor of the contributions of Hispanic-Americans to the world of
 
the arts.
 The arts education curriculum,  in our multi-cultural
 
society, often does not even indicate the existence of more than
 
one artistic tradition.
 The absence of appropriate instruction
 
in school is being countered in many places by the
 
intensification of after-school cultural training by many
 
minority groups, especially Asian; unfortunately,  such
 
educational enhancement is normally only available to members of
 
the cultural group.
 
And,  in the folk arts, there are few folk arts institutions
 
available to supplement what l
ittle the student learns from his
 
teacher.
 Even placing folk artists in residence presents great
 
difficultuies, because many folk artists have other full-time
 
employment which does not allow them to take time away --
whether a week, a semester,  a year -- from the job in order to
 
spend time in the classroom.
 
INSTITUTIONALIZATION.
 There are very few institutions dedicated
 
completely to the preservation and presentation of folk arts.
 
In 1984,  the Folk Arts Program gave project grants to 11 Folk
 
Arts Institutions;  in 1987,  to 15,  certainly not a significant
 
increase-
-,
,
 
Although the last years have seen some new and venturesome
 
action in this area,  the movement is slow because the
 
possibilities of economic rewards are so tenuous.
 Those who
 
undertake the ta
tend to be idealists and inexperienced in
 
management;  their
 
"
absorption with learning the necessary facts
 
of institutional development turns them away from field and
 
artistic activity.
 Although this may be a necessary phase
 
during the building of
` ,'
 
`a field, we see a powerful lot of
 
managing these days, concerned with fewer and fewer high-quality
 
artistic products.
 
TERMINOLOGIES.
 Although the'Zndowment's position on the
 
question has been steady and c
�6 sistent, a number of authorities
 
have defined the term "folk art""-in a number of ways, many of
 
them in total and irreconcilable difference with each other.
 
Confusion has thus become confounded"'Wpongst the general public;
 
this has done really great damage to what is essentially a
 
widely supportable program concept.
 
In addition the failure of many artistic disciplines to
 
develop non-culture-bound terminologies has made communication
 
across culture baIriers difficult and downright inaccurate.

What I would like to see in 1985:
 
1
)  Twenty-five self-supporting ethnic  (
or regional American) tours on the
 
road twelve weeks per year each.
 
2
)  A state folk arts coordinator in every state (whether employed by the
 
Arts Council, the Historical Society or the Parks and Recreation Department).
 
3
)  A training program in every agricultural college to educate county agents
 
to recognize and encourage traditional artists.
 
4
)  A series of annual non-public-performance-centered convocations similar
 
to the Centrum fiddlers bash model where old and young musicians and
 
artists could foregather to exchange skills, repertoires, ideas.
 
5
)  A series of small businesses that can supply traditional craftsworkers
 
with their needs:
 crochet and other special thread, particular weaves
 
of cloth, musical instruments, beads, hides, etc., etc.
 
6
)  Neighborhood traditional artists, from banjo pickers to duck decoy
 
carvers, employed as traditional artists in residence in a minimum
 
of ten school districts in every one of the states and territories.
 
7
)  A maximum effort on the part of the federal government to make available
 
to every ethnic, Native American and regional culture the federal
  
holdings relevant to their particular artistic and cultural  histo r
y.
 
8
)  A non-academically-based, but academically-supported, effort to develop
 
a cadre of young, energetic, well-informed, culturally sophisticated,
 
sensitive, and dedicated workers to see that all of the above is super-
latively well done.
