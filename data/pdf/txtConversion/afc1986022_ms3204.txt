Conversation with approximately 77 year old black
male, Florida (Transcription)
W197 <77M?> <unintelligible text
<unintelligible text> is a very frail, elderly looking, tired, old man. He claims to be seventy-
seven years old, although this could be argued: I believe that he is in his 80's.
I met <unintelligible text> when I was quite young. He has been working for my family for
about twelve years. He has always been a friend of the family and was most delighted to
participate in this project. He seemed to be elated that I even asked him! He was most
willing to talk and help in any way. He loves to discuss his many experiences.
From, listening to his speech one could quickly assume that he was an elderly black
speaker. He is one of eight children, born to parents who made their living mainly as
farmers. He led a normal childhood, all things taken into consideration. He definetly
experienced things in his days that one would not expect or see in the 1970's. He has
worked very hard all of his life and never achieved anything the easy way. He has always
made a living from menial jobs, mostly farming, and outdoor type things.
<unintelligible text> is from a low socio-economic class and has never had any type of
formal education. Consequently, he can not read or write anything but his name. Given
an opportunity, I think he would have done well in school because he has the capability.
I believe that he would have been able to go further in life if things would have been
different for him.

<unintelligible text> is like everyone else. He has very definite likes and dislikes and
readily expresses them: One of his main dislikes is people who don't work: I suppose that
he feels that he worked his way through life and everyone else should too.
<unintelligible text> remains very active and he contributes his longevity to the fact that he
has worked all of his life. <unintelligible text>
