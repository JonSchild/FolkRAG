I 
SHOULD LIKE TO.—C ONCLUDED. 
Sienaer:—You see before I 
got married, every thing was 
just as dull as it could be; and now this season there's no end 
to the parties, Sce. 
Every night the girls come in my room, 
and say: Well, aint you going to the ball? And 1 
say just as 
sweet as can be, Hubby dear, shall we go? And he answers back 
as cross as a 
bear, no indeed we shant go, we'll stay at home 
these hard times. 
Then' all the girls come home the next 
morning, and tell how many sweet-hearts, how many dances, 
how many ice creams, how many boiled oysters, and all that 
sort of thing they have had, and it makes me feel just as 
though. — Chorus.

The other night in the dollar store, 
I 
met a 
gent so fair, 
Oh hazel were his beaming eyes, 
And golden was his hair. 
He looked at me a 
little while, 
I 
him in silence eyed, 
And soon we both were talking love, 
While walking side by side. 
SPMEN:—He said, you'll allow me to present you with 
this beautiful china doll for a 
dollar ?—Oh no, thank you sir, 
I've got through playing with dolls. 
Then we took a 
little 
walk up Broadway; we looks in all the store windows, saw 
the pictures, stopped at the jewelry stores to see the pretty 
things, Holiday presents, and all that sort of things. 
He 
said these are very nice articles. 
I 
answered yes, real nice 
presents; I 
said PRESENTS for a 
young lady, half a 
dozen 
times, and be never once took the hint. 
Then he said let's 
go to the theatre. 
To the theatre ? I 
couldn't, because you 
see my husband is there, though I 
assure you.—Chorus. 
3 
But now I 
must conclude my song, 
And toddle off with speed, 
Or otherwise I 
feel convinced, 
There'll be a 
row indeed. 
For Charles Augustus, my dear hub, 
Is waiting close at hand, 
And rows with him I 
do declare, 
Are more than I 
can stand. 
Sporm—I'm really sorry to bid you good evening, but 
my husband ( Mr. Rickey is heard calling at the rear of the 
stage: Mrs. Hughes, will you come down stairs and get me 
my supper and the ould man has come home, and wants 
warm water for shaving. 
Come off quick, for the child has 
fell in the fire.) Ladies and gentlemen, I 
hope you wont ask 
me to sing any more, as my husband is so awfully jealous, 
even if he is Irish, (Mr. Rickey) Who's Irish? will cut that 
short, with your " I 
should like to." 
Well, as far as I 
am 
personally c,oneerned you know you all know. — Chorut.

RAILWAY GUIDE. 
AS 
sung by JENNIE HUGHES. 
I 
HAD to make a 
journey a 
little while ago, 
Somewhere down the Jersey Central, you must know*, 
A 
splendid-looking man, he was seated by my side, 
He asked me if I 
would lend to him my Railway Guide. 
The man lie was troubled with absence of mind, 
The ticket for his journey he had left it far behind, 
lie could not recollect the town to which he wished to ride, 
So begged that I 
would lend to him my Railway Guide. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, he had actually forgotten the name of. the 
town that lie wished to travel to. 
Could only remember that 
the word contained the letter B, M or K, 
So I 
began to run 
through a 
list of towns whose name contained that letter, such 
RS: 
CHORUS. 
Manyunk and Mauchchunck, Neversink and Squedunk, 
There's Peekskid and Fishkill and Catskill beside, 
Weehawken and Hoboken, Binghampton and Stonington, 
He said he'd sure to find it in my Railway Guide, 
Then I 
produced my Appleton, and said to him " Good roan, 
Take the book I'm reading, and find it if you can;" 
He took the volume from my hand and eagerly he tried; 
To find the place he wanted in my Railway Guide. 
He searched o'er every leaf, and turned o'er every page, 
Until at last the fellow he got in quite a 
rage. 
• 
6 
He soon turned round to me, and bitterly he cried: 
Dear Miss! I 
cannot find it in your Railway Guide, 
SPOKEN.—Altheugh he said he had read all through. 
Manyunk and Mauchchunk, 
Ix, 
I 
reached my destination and was going to alight. 
He placed his hand upon my arm, and said with much affright, 
Oh, dear miss! don't leave me, all alone to ride, 
What shall I 
do without you, and your Railway Guide. 
Said I: Oh no, I'm going down now to my hotel, 
You, sir, cannot walk with me, for it would not look well: 
But he linked his arm in mine, and kept marching by my side, 
He kept a 
firm grasp on me and my Railway Guide. 
SPOKEN 
And, said he, if we put our heads together, we 
shall certainly soon discover, whether it is 
Manyunk and Mauchchunk, 
c. 
He walked with me in silence, some distance on the road. 
I 
knew not how to leave him, when I 
got to my abode: 
And all that afternoon, the foolish fellow tried, 
To pay attention to me, and my Railway Guide; 
And once he plucked up courage, and squeezed my little glove, 
He suddenly discovered that he was deep in love; 
lie proposed and I 
accepted, Fm soon to be his bride, 
And thus I'll gain a 
husband with my Railway Guide. 
SPOKEN: And he tells me it makes him feel so happy. that 
he don't care if he never arrives either at 
Alaynunk and Mauthehtink, &eft

THAT'S WHERE I 
KNOW YOU ARE RIGHT. 
As sang by JE'S'StE H IIGELZ3. 
GOOD people I 
ask you to listen, 
And heed what I 
say in my song, 
Common sense is the be.A kilid of tutor, 
It teaches us right from wrong. 
There's two ends you must know to a 
string, boys. 
So be carefal when you fly your kite, 
Have a 
care that she don't go too high in the air, 
That's where I 
know you are right ; 
Fair play is a 
jewel we must dearly prize, 
So be impartial, my boys, in a 
fight ; 
You must always believe what you see with you're eyes, 
And that's where I 
know you are right. 
Whenever you go on a 
pic-nic, 
Enjoy yourselves, have lots of sport. 
Take your girl, your father and mother ; 
Good lager beer, sherry and port, 
Don't stand still and look like a 
quaker, 
Be merry, cheerful and bright, 
And when there's a 
dance, 
Bounce in for a 
chance, 
And that's where I 
know you are right. 
It's pleasure, my boys, that keeps us alive, 
So go in for fun day and night; 
Laugh and. grow fat, don't look like a 
eat; 
S 
a.nd that's where I 
know you are right. 
If you're wise enough to save money 
And send all your children to school, 
The world will call you a 
miser; 
Just kick 'gainst the world like a 
mule, 
For when you are aged and decrepici, 
From hard work you take a 
respite, 
Then you will say I'm dry on a 
wet day, 
And that's where I 
know you are right. 
For money, you know, makes the mare 
Don't be stingy, greedy or tight; 
You can be a 
good fellow 
Without being a 
fool, 
And that's where I 
know you are right. 
Should you marry a 
bad-tempered woman, 
One who could give you a 
look; 
That would send you out in the kitchen 
To wash, to scrub, and to cook : 
Go tie up your things in a 
bundle, 
Escape from your room in the night, 
As a 
matter of course, take a 
sudden divorce, 
And that's where I 
know 3 
ou are right. 
To the ladies, God bless you, 
I 
say the same thing; 
If you're brute of a 
husband gets tI,7,•ht, 
Lock him up in a 
room, 
Beat him with a 
broom, 
And thge where I 'mow you are right.

JUNIUS BROWN THE TRAGEDIAN, 
Or " No 
Matter." 
I'M an actor who's seen better days, 
For I 
once was a 
star I've a 
notion; 
I've been toss'cl about all sorts of ways 
'Upon the theatrical ocean. 
But jealousy, spite and all that 
has brought me down to but a 
seedy ' un, 
It's been all caus'd by envy—that's flat, 
For I 
once was a 
heavy tragedian. 
CHORUS. 
rye been a 
bright star in my time, 
Though now I'm reduced to a 
seedy 'nn, 
In me you may please to behold, 
Junius Brown, the Tragedian. 
You have all seen my name in the bills, 
Which is Junius Antonius Brown, sirs ; 
And I 
flatter myself I 
have caused, 
Great excitement in many a 
town, sirs: 
My last " shop " was the Garrick, Whitechapel; 
In a " part" that I 
could above any fit, 
My " screw " sirs, for only six nights 
Was two pounds and a 
half a 
clear benefit. 
SPOKEN. — That was money, but what do they offer talent 
now ? I 
was actually offered the other day twenty-five •‘ bob" 
per week to play Othello, the Clown in the Pantomime, and do 
bill-sticking in the morning. 
Did I 
accept it? 
Blood and 
blue fire? 
Never! NEVER! but no matter, a 
time may coma 
when they will be glad to secure the services of Brown the 
Tragedian. 
I've been 
bright star in my time, Szc. 
Simce Kemble none like "-
;: e's been seen, 
Yet nought but bad lack is my my portion ; 
My friends say I'm better than Kean, 
That my " Richard" and " Hamlet's" a 
caution. 
They say my declaiminz's a 
treat— 
In the speech over Caesar by Antony' 
I 
can do the soft parts low and sweet, 
Likewise I 
can " pile up the agony." 
SPOKEN.—For two consecltivo weeks was I 
the leading 
attraction at the Royal Bower, and should have startled the 
world at Drury Lane: but for professional malice. 
I 
am kept 
off the boards out of fear. 
They know I should render 
Shakespeare's great characters as they have never been ren-
dered before. 
My reading of his plays is entirely diderent to 
Macready, Kean, Phelps, T. C. King and all those fellows— 
they know that—but, no matter. a 
time may come when they 
will cringe to Brown, the Tragedian. 
I've been a 
bright star in my time, (te. 
search through the " Era" each week 
And I " write in" when talent's required, 
But they say they don't know me, ( there's cheek, 
Of such insults and envy I'm tired). 
They offer me terms for a " super," 
Or ask if I'm up to '. utility, 
But Ill starve and remain as I 
am, 
An artiste of wondrous 
SPOTZEN.—Me. ME ! 
Junius Antonins Brown descend to do 
the cock in Hamlet. or Bo'lly in the Pantomime. 
Ye Gods 
and small fishes 
fl ther would I 
descend from my pedestal 
of fame and become a 
comic- vocalist, but no matter! NO 
MATTER! ! 
The time may come when they will be glad to 
pile gold at the feet of Brow.1, the Tragedian. 
I've been a 
bright star in my time, &c.)

WAIT TILL YOU GET IT. 
WE'RE always a 
wishing, 
It matters not what, 
For seldom you'll End one 
Content with his lot ; 
Perhaps you wish that a 
fortune, 
Might fall in your way, 
Say— ten thousand 3 
year, 
Well—all ; can say. 
CHORL'8. 
Is wait till you get it, 
Wait till you get It, 
And if you don't get it, 
Then wait till you do. Repcat chorus 
If you're hard up, on this 
You may safely depend, 
You'll find it a 
job 
To discover a 
friend; 
Just ask one to lend you. 
Well—only a 
pound— 
make EOZIO excuse, 
And sure I'll be bound. 
You may wait, Ex. 
12 
Pirhaps you've ' been out of Toin, 
And just got back by train, • 
You feel (loosed thirsty, 
And wish for a ' drain," 
But its past twelve o'clock, 
And a 
man dressed in blue, 
Says, " Now then move lion, sir," 
You know what to do. 
You must wait, &c. 
My Income Tax paper 
Comes in, when I 
learn, 
That my income is morn 
Than three times what I 
earn! 
To lay it on thick, 
They've a 
beeautiful knack, 
Of course I 
return it, 
And write on the back, 
Wait till you, &c, 
Sometimes you go courting, 
The one you adore, 
And you try for a 
kiss 
Just behind the street door; 
She says " Go along, sir, 
You do if you dare! 
If you kiss ire I'll scream, 
I 
will I 
declare !" 
You must wait, &c.

WISH YOUR MOTHER WOULD COME, 
I 
HAVE to hold the child, the while my wife is out, 
It makes me feel quite wild, the Way she gads. about; 
Hus.
a-a-hush a 
bye—there suck its little thumb, 
And don't begin to cry, oh ! I 
wish your mother would come. 
Oh! I 
wish your mother would come. 
I 
gave the child some gruel, still louder tho' it cried, 
For I 
gave it boiling hot, and burnt its poor inside; 
I 
wish that I 
were deaf, or else the child were dumb, 
For I 
an not stand this noise, oh I 
I 
wish your mother would 
come. 
! 
I, wish your mother would come: 
I 
usedto think my wife had nought all day to do, 
But this nursing pon my life, is work enough for two; 
Its culing its little teeth, there's one just thro' his gum, 
Be quiet you little thief, oh! I 
wish your mother would come. 
Oh! I 
wish your mother would come. 
I!I only put him down, and chance to turn my back, 
le gets the saucepan lid, and looks like a 
little black ; 
:lack and Jill went up a 
hill turn ti turn; turn ti turn; 
?ve got on all my Sunday clothes, oh 
I 
wish your mother 
would come. 
Oh! I 
wish your mother would come, 
Oh, husbauds who will blame your wives for doing nought.. 
Just stop at home one day experience must be bought; 
I've only stopp'd two hours, and tho' you may think it rum, 
For more than half that time, oh ! I've wished your mother 
would come. 
Oh! I've wish'd your mother would come.

THE MIDNIGHT RANGER. 
I'M a 
boy that is fond of a 
midnight lark. 
Some folks call me a 
gay young spark; 
The reason I 
suppose is, my deeds are dark, 
And they call me the Midnight Ranger. 
Music pealing, oft revealing 
O'er my senses softly stealing, 
Gas lamps burning, home returning 
Just before the break of day. 
Citonns. 
Rollicking about on a 
starlight night, 
Tickling the girls is my soul's delight; 
I'm going to be married to Mary Ann Whitt), 
And I 
really believe she's an angel. 
Shouting and bawling with might and main, 
Wetting our gills with bright Champagne, 
I 
never have a 
loss, it's always a 
gain, 
I 
find for the Midnight Ranger. 
Organs winding, purses finding, 
Eats all batter'd, torn or lost; 
Umbrellas, drunken fellows, 
To the station— fine and costs. 
Rollicking about on a 
starlight night, &a 
Each pal I 
have is a 
gay young spark, 
And good for a 
spree when the night is dark ; 
Our howling makes the watch-dogs bark, 
And we laugh to scorn all danger. 
Pebbles flinging, homeward singing, 
Wrenching knockers, ringing bells, 
Shutters marking, peelers chaffing, 
Laughing and larking with the girls. 
Rollicking about on a 
starlight night, ke.

CURRANTS AND PLUMS. 
SO early in the morning my sweetheart Rosy May, 
Rose to make her pudding upon the Christmas day ; 
Theprettiest girl of any. whatever people say, 
Aid while she mix'd her pudding, she sung this Christ-
mas lay 
CHORUS. 
Currants and Plums! citron and crumbs! 
The best way to mix it's with lingers and thumbs. 
I 
rose Setimes that morning, and went to wish my dear, 
A 
awry, merry Christmas and a 
hippy glad new year ; 
I 
look'l in at her lattice, she didn't notice me. 
But iurnm'd and mixed her pudding like a 
little busy bee. 
Currants and Plums, & e. 
I 
wated her pick the raisins and wash the currants o'er, 
bh3sed her tiny lingers while they dabbled in the flour ; 
tee.41..." 
But wien she'd chopped the suet, put the big pot on the grate, 
stug this Christmas carol for I 
could no honer wait. 
Currants and Plums, & c. 
My daiing little Rosy blush'd a 
rosy, rosy red, 
Fhe left her Christmas pudding and hung down her pretty 
head ; 
Tlen looking up, she clapped aloft, her floury hands in glee, 
Crying-" Come and see the pudding, love, I've made for you 
and me." 
Currants and Plums, Sr,c. 
Te put the pudding in the pot, and watch'd it while it boiled ; 
;For a 
Christmas pudding left alone's a 
Christmas pudding 
spoiled ; 
Then side by side before the tire, with many a 
loving kiss, 
We passed the happy hours away, and sung a 
chant like 
this. 
Currants and Plums, & c. 
Of Christmas puddings in my time, I've tasted many a 
score. 
But I 
never tasted pudding half so good as this before : 
And I've got a 
precious promise, from my darling Rosy May-
To make another pudding on our happy wedding day. 
Currants and Plums, ttc.

There's nothing in this wide, wide world, could please you

To stroll among the clover, and steal a 
loving kiss.

ITS WEALLI A DWEADFUL AFFAIR' 
rm sure I 
can't think what the world's coming to, 
The times are so wretchedly slow. 
'Tis hard to make out what a 
fetish should do, 
Or yet where a 
fella') should go. 
I've puzzled my bwain and I've scratched at my wig, 
Till I've almost torn out ev'ry hair ; 
But I 
cannot produce an idea worth a 
fig, 
It's weally a 
dweadful affair. 
C 
noRrs. 
Oh, pity my case, I 
never can carry my cares, 
I'm crushed, fairly crushed with the weight of these dweadful 
• 
affairs. 
I'm rather ambitious, and yet cannot tell 
how to get up the ladder of fame : 
As Snodgrass and Snooks does' at sound very well— 
But for that I've my father to blame. 
There's the bar, and the navy, and aw I 
forgot 
There's the army, I 
might get on there— 
But if war should break out I 
might chance to get shot, 
And that would be a. dweadful aflair. 
Oh ! pity my case, & c. 
One day I 
went out with my dog and my gun, 
Intending to pop at some game ; 
But. whethaw from weakness of sight, or the sun, 
I 
nevaw could get a 
good aim. 
19 
fired my piece and I 
raised quite a 
fog. 
The bird it new high in the air; 
Bnt somehow I'd shot off the tail of my dog, 
It was weally a 
dreadful affair. 
Oh I 
pity my case, &c. 
rve often heard tell of poor men being lamed, 
Or of losing an arm or a 
leg, 
Or their backs being broken, or otherwise maimed 
And then of their having to beg. 
Ml this they will bear and with scarcely a 
grin, 
Well! I'm not a 
muff you're aware ; 
But I 
screamed like a 
rabbit, when pricked with a 
pin, 
It was weeny a 
dweadful affair. 
Ohl pity my ca.se, &c, 
It's adweadful affair when my boots are too tight, 
Or my coat is not properly made, 
Or my tie will not fit, or my collar's not right, 
Or my gloves not exactly the shade. 
Bat I've run through my song and endeavored to please. 
Being anxious to make matters square ; 
So I 
beg to retire, If I 
don't I 
shall sneeze, 
And that would be a 
dwea iful affair. 
! 
pity my case, &c.

O'ER THE HILLS AND DALES SO GRAND. 
Written by E. DAvws, expressly for JENNIE II IIG8Es. 
I 
CAME from dear Old Ireland, with very little money, 
I 
crossed the great big ocean, the Yankee folks to see, 
I've heard of great big wonders, but very few I've seen now, 
So if you'll wait, why I'll relate, the wonders which I've seen. 
Of the hills and dales so grand, that's seen in Paddy's land, 
The boys and girls of our dear Isle, so beautiful to see, 
Driving on a 
jaunting car, with Paddy by my side, 
When the moon is shining brightly, along the road we glide. 
There's the " Dargle" and the " 
Gien," in the County 
Wicklow, 
The sweet Lakes of Killarney, in Kerry County too,' 
Not forgetting " Bldrney Castle," you all know what I 
mean 
now, 
For there of course the boys all go, to kiss the Blarney stone

THE KILKENNY BOY. 
As sang by JENNIE HOGHZE. 
I 
WENT to school to Darby Toole, who'd been a 
soldier I've 
been told. 
His talk of wars and drums and scars came over me when 
nine years old; 
Then I 
took to drums instead of sums, shillelah being my 
writing pen, 
./kly only books being outside crooks, my only joy being 
fighting men. 
Disdaining brogues, I 
crossed the bogs, with heart as light 
as any boy, 
The girls would cry when me they'd spy, " Sure there's Larry 
Moore the Irish Boy ! " 
cmourts, 
Oh 1 
the nice, the:teat, the tall, complete, 
The handsome, fine Kilkenny boy. 
When older grown, the girls—och hone !— about their hearts 
they twisted me, 
Till Sergeant Shay, he came one day, and with a 
shilling he 
listed me ; 
Then Kitty Burn she left her churn, Saying, "Och ! you've 
been deceiving me." 
And Kate O'Neil—faith I'll go bail—will break her heart for 
leaving me. 
So, in this plight, a 
soldier tight; I 
marched as fine as any boy 
The fair to melt, the to pelt, none equalled the Kilkenny boy. 
Oh ! the nice, the neat, & c. 
But Sergeant Shay lie did one day, a 
bullet laid him on the 
floor, 
That saoine ap
iry 
olth;ioo
gue'reth;at stopped his brogue a 
sergeant made 
f L  
And when the peace bid fighting cease, of gals—och hone-
1 
had a. few 
Who triedlo'teltse, but none could please like the charming 
widow Donoghue. 
It is herself that has the pelf, it is myself can spend it with 
joy, 
she cried "Och hone! you're . all my own,rmy darling, fln 
Kilkenny boy." 
Oh t' the nice, the neat, Icc.

My Charley's in the Key West Fleet. 
Ara : 
Johnny of the Fire Brigade. 
AA 
sung by JaNwis EMUS& 
'MERE is not a 
lady in the lead. 
That I 
envy her lot; 
My Charley is a 
Sailor bold, 
A 
coat of blue he's got; 
He is a 
son of Uncle Sam! 
And for our flag does fight; 
That banner that we all do love, 
Which does defend the right. 
CHORUS. 
When the cry of battle's heard— he flies quick at the word, 
He cares not, he heeds not, he fears not defeat; 
lie's always first in fight, beneath our banner bright, 
IS 
Charley, my Charley, my Charley in the Key West fleet. 
I 
last saw my young hero bold, 
'Twas on a 
Summer's day; 
He stood upon his vessel's deck, 
As she sailed down the bay; 
He gave me one sweet parting smile, 
He waved his hand and cried; 
"I go to fight that foeman bold, 
That has our flag defied " 
When the cry, ko.

And me! he will be true.

He'll fight the battle well; 
As Farragut, and Lawrence did, 
And history will tell. 
When the cry, fle.

But better still I 
love to praise, 
Our nation's sailor band!

In joyful glee we'll meet;

GIVE HIM ANOTHER CHANCE, 
As sling by JEN7tra HrorrEs. 
THIS world's a 
cold and selfish one, 
As many tnousands know; 
Who once were blessed with hope and joy, 
But now are fallen low. 
Whose hearts were ever kind and warm, 
Nor turned from grief aside; 
But always lent a 
listening ear, 
When pain and sorrow sighed. 
Then let us aid their sad distress, 
For we like them perchance, 
May crave the favor of the world, 
To give us another chance. 
We cannot search their breaking hearts, 
To know the anguish there, 
But kindly acts may heal their smart. 
And soothe their sad despair, 
For many whom you meet to-day. 
In sorrow broken down 
Possesses hearts as kind and true, 
And noble as thine own. 
25 
Then do not turn away from'thom; 
With cold and haughty glaucq, 
But hit your fallen brother up, 
And give him another chance. 
The riches of the world were made, 
Not for a 
selfish end; 
But that we generously might spare, 
Some, for a 
suffering friend,. 
No matter what the faults may be. 
Concealed within his'heart, 
To save the wretched erring one, 
Is a 
true and manly part: 
Then, when.you see a 
fallen man, 
With sorrow in his glance, 
Don't crush him farther in the dust, 
But give him another chance.

MY MEMORY IS SO BAD, 
As sung by JENNIE HOGEtZi. 
FOLKS says Pm growing querulous, a 
regular cross-grained 
patch, 
Because 
I'm troubled with the gout, and wear a wig—a 
scratch; 
But worse than that, they spread reports, 
they say they've 
heard from me, 
Which cause a 
deal of mischief, but with truth do not agree; 
I'm sure I 
never dreamt of such, it really makes me sad, 
''o tAink,—what was I,saying then ? my mem'ry is so bad. 
My mem'ry is so bad, it really makes makes me sad— 
To think what I 
was saying then? my mem'ry is so bad. 
Oh I 
remember, Tuesday, no, 'twas Wednesday thereabout, 
I 
heard on good authority, the President is coming out,— 
At opera and at Concert to, his gracious Majesty 
Will smile upon his subjects true, as once it used to be; 
Now p'haps you think I 
made this up, which sounds like news 
most glad, 
heard it,—though I 
can't say where, my mem'ry is so bad. 
Oh! dear its very sad, it nearly drives me mad 
I 
can't tell where I 
heard it, for my mem'ry is so bad. 
I 
took a 
cab the other day, and told him where to go 
'Twas Saratoga or Niagara,—but I 
found myself at Troy, 
In vain I 
stormed. he coolly said,—" I'd bade him drive me 
there," 
37 
Wben in the dense exciten: at, I 
forgot to pay his fare! 
Ile might have asked politely, not in terms as he were mad, 
Then summoned me, I'd costs to pay—my mem'ry is so bad. 
He served me very bad, and no redrees I 
had, 
The Magistrate said I 
must pay, since my mem'ry was. 
so hail, 
I 
once fell over head and hears in love, but even then, 
My great misfortune haunted me—most wretched of all 
me; 
The day was fixed, I 
bought the ring, when dreadful to relate, 
I 
reached the Church, but found I 
came just two days after 
date, 
Of course a Breach of Promise Case they brought, and so I 
had— 
Five hundred dollars to pay, because my mem'ry is so bad. 
It really was too bad, to pay of course I 
had, 
Five hundred dollars, and all because my mem'ry is so 
bad. 
An sting by JENNIE HuGaze. 
I 
AM tormented nio.ht and day, 
The fact I 
cannot smother, 
By my intended husband, 
And also my big brother ; 
They're always teazing me, they are, 
I've not one moment's quiet, 
From morn till night, ' Us their delight 
In the house to cause a 
riot. 
SPOKEN : I 
used to think my brother a 
harem scarem, but 
I 
assure you my sweetheart, Lionel, is a 
perfect limb, always 
playing tricks upon us, but notwithstanding his faults— 
Cuosus. 
Oh He loves me and I 
love him, 
We both love one another, 
se's such a 
dreadful teazo, he is, 
He's worse than my big brother. 
My brothers'ied my sweetheart 
To bitter beer and smoking ; 
They don't indulge too much, 
But then ' tis really so provoking. 
In the drawing room or sitting room, 
The fumes are wafted freely, 
The smoke in fumes does arise 
And always chokes me nearly. 
29 
Sroxr..N : 
No matter how I 
lecture them about smoking in 
the dro.wing•room, they won't desist. 
Therr Lionel says to me, 
"Now my darling wife, that is to be, you wouldn't debar your 
husband that will be, of one of his greatest enjoyments, would 
you? 
Well, there, I'll 
put out the pipe to oblige you? 
Directly I 
leave the room, there they are puffing clouds out 
again, but 
Oh I 
He loves me, itc. 
Now my brother climbs the house-top 
And down the chimney cries, 
When we're talking of the future, 
And arranging nuptial ties. 
Then Lionel my intemled 
Makes all sorts of false alarms, 
By saying the wardrobe is on fire, 
And swoons in the servant's arms. 
SPOKEN : Well, Fillet him have his own way while he's 
single, but I 
believe he'll be just as bad when married. 
Well, 
I 
don't care if he is. 
For Oh ! He loves me, &c.

ABRAM! Mickey, will ye leave us thus, 
To cross the raging main; 
When gone, what will become of me, 
Should you ne'er come back again: 
The Hawthorn it may flower in Spring! 
The Daisy brigi.t may grow— 
But naught to me will comfort bring, 
If you, my darling, go. 
CHORUS, 
Arrah! Mickey, put your frieze coat ON 
Walk through the bog with me; 
Ant you can whisper in my ear, 
How dearly you love me. 
What need you leave your native land,

Then stop were sweet the Shamrock grows, 
Stop with your Kathleen dear.

Close by the briht turf fire; 
Where the

What more can you desire.

And the bells from every village spire

As Sung by JESNIC LIIIGECES. 
DID you iver see Meg, dashing Galway Meg, 
The wickedest witch in Ould Erin, 
Who has eyes like a 
sloe, and a 
bosom of snow, 
That the boys are all toasting and cheerin;, 
Such cheeks, och the roses and the lips (Father Moses), 
To taste them would make you quite tipsy, 
Thin whiniver you're dead or with spirits of lead, 
Take a 
smack from the mouth of this gipsy. • 
Meg can clear a 
stone wall with a 
mettlesome nag, 
Leap a 
ditch with the best in the chase, 
Sound the whoop tally ho! to the hounds on the go, 
And 'come out the first man in the race, 
Such an air and such hair when she springs don't you 
stare, 
But be aisey and plaise not get friskey, 
For a 
squint at her foot, and her ancle to boot, 
Would warm you all over like whiskey. 
She can danco, she can sing, in the ould Irish way, 
Take a 
noggin, and swing a 
Shillelah, 
She's the belle of the fair when the girls are all there, 
And the queen of the court where she may be. 
Such a 
neck ! such a 
waist (Och houlcl me, make haste,) 
To clasp them would make you onaisey, 
Your courage is gone, and you're conquered, 0

I

lady's glove. 
Her lovely hand was in it as I

I 
thought myself in paradise—it's funny when you feel that 
way. 
CHORUS. 
I felt as tho' I'd tumbled into honey, and some one had left, me 
all their money. 
The feeling's so peculiar and funny, its funny when you feel 
that way. 
I 
took her down to supper, and sat down by her side, 
I 
helped her to the nices, and filled her glass with pride, 
In fact paid such attention, that she viewed me with dismay, 
moved my chair so close to hers, 4.'s funny when you feel that 
way. 
I

We met again one afternoon, and as we were alone,• 
I 
plucked up nerve to ask her if some day she'd be my own ; 
She blushed and said go see papa and ask him if I 
may, 
I 
danced the cancan round the room, it's funny when you fee) 
that way. 
I 
felt as though &c. 
The old man said that we might wed and so he crowned on,

And I 
shall be a 
married man in about a

OH! NICODEMITS. 
My lover he's going to sea, Oh! Nicodenans, 
He's going away and leaving me, 
To watch the little fishes, swimming in the sea ; 
But he'll soon wish for home, and to be back with me. 
The shin will heave to, Nicodemus! 
And so wretched you will be, so wretched ,i7oc will be. 
C FIORLIS. 
(Spoken.) So she said— 
Oh, Nicodemus ! Nicodemus! 
don't you go away? 
I've loved you Nicodemus and I've loved you many a 
day, 
I've loved you in your plain attire, your lovely fustian co-at 
Don,t leave me .Nicodemus, for that beiler-bursting boat. 
(SporEN.) And again she bec,an to sing— 
Salt water, you know, is very wet, Oh, Nicodemus 
You know you are my only pet, 
And your absence will cause me to fume and fret ; 
They will feed you on salt junk and nasty soft boiled peas, 
Think of this well : Nicodemus ! 
Ere you cross those watery seas, those windy watery seas; 
So she said, ttc, 
And she also said— 
Of pumpkins boiled you'll get no more, Oh, Nicodemus I 
Convince yourself of this before, 
You can't run away there's no back door t

Reef the anchor, Nleorlemus, the Captain he will ray, 
You'll havc to hold on by your eyebrows, 
Or you'll be blown away, straight down to Botany Bay 
So she said, itc. 
This is what he said— 
It's no use you talking to me; said Nieodemus ? 
For I 
intend ageing out to sea, 
Out to China for Souchong and Lingo Tea. 
That's a 
profitable cargo. in fact you can't get a 
better, 
Direct from Hong Kong, Australia, 
When you send to me a 
letter, you send to me a 
letter. 
And she began again yelping, 
Oh, Nicodemus, &c.

Oh love, when you'rein love every half hour you'd go te tonty

But Oh, love, if she won't love, you talk about drowning your-

If it's all right she'll giggle and say please ask father if I

Then you feel njolly and gay, and tease her till she names the

You'll serenade her when she's abed and her dad drops flower-
pots on your head. 
Oh love, tte. 
Oh love, when you've your love out, all the money you have 
you must ladle, 
Servants, dresses, parties. and balls, perhaps each year a

When the honeymoon is past then your eyes are not so blind, 
Your dream was far too good to last and your face grows long

Your looked for happiness begins with a mother-in-law and 
beatiful twins.

THERE'S BOUND TO BE A ROW. 
I'M a 
poor unlucky married man, 
I've got an awful wife, 
To please her I 
do all I

But still she plagues my life, 
If I

She'll find a

And if not in at eight each nigl

CHORUS. 
There's bound to be a

Bound to be a

Do all in life to please my wife, 
Yet there's bound to be a

She makes me do the household work 
When I 
come home at night, 
If I 
cough or sneeze when going to bed, 
Of course that is not right. 
If she should wake the young ones up, 
Willi rage she'll storm I

Tyrolean Duckso 
As sung by licliAs Jennie Hughes. 
Whenever ducks go two by two, 
They're surely g9t something in view, 
And what it is they will not tell, 
AlthOugh themselves they know it well, 
They smoothe the feathers on their back, 
With a 
loving quack, quack, quack, quack. 
CHORUS. 
Quack, quack, quack, quack, 
And little ducks words never lack, 
Tra oh In uh, TraIn, tra In uh, ah 
Quack, quack, quack. 
Whenever ducks go three by three, 
It puzzles much both you and me, 
Are there two drakes and but one duck, 
Or but a

They smoothe the feathers on his back.'

loving quack, quack, quack,quack.

Squeeze Me, JON 
In Harlem Lane, there once did dwell a 
charming little beau, 
With whom I 
walked and sometimes talked, his ehristian name 
[was Joe; 
I 
knew that he was fond of me, though he never told me so, 
But when my hand in his was pressed, I 
said 0 
squeeze me Joe. 
CHORUS. 
0, Squeeze me, Joe, 0, Squeeze me, Joe, 
It makes me feel so jolly you know ; 
0, squeeze me, Joe, 0, squeeze me, Joe, 
And if you love me tell me so. 
He kept a 
pretty little farm, and horses he had three, 
So he said, my dear, there'll be no harm to take a 
ride with me, 
Be did and slipp'd from off the horse, and caught me you must 
• [ know; 
Then placed his arm around my waist, when I 
cried, don't 
CHO.— [squeeze rue Joe. 
Be popp'd the question there and then, he did upon my life, 
And said my little darling, will you really be my wife; 
I 
gave a 
sigh, then said, 0 
my, I 
really can't say no, 
I'll be your wife and joy through life, if you'll only squeeze me 
CHO.— [Joe 
I 
married him then, and now am happy as can be, 
Fcr the little farm, and all its charms of course belong to me, 
And when he says, I'm going away, to town for a 
day or so, 
/ 
isn't do less than give a 
kiss, and say, 0, squeeze me, Joe. 
, 
WAS at a 
first-class eating noose, not far from Slaiden 
Lane, 
I 
used to dine and gaze upon the charming waitress, Jane, 
Such eyes, such teeth, such rosy cheeks, I'd never seen 
before, 
I 
never noticed what I'd eat, until I 
paid the score. 
SPOKE:C.—And when I 
asked her what I 
owed, she'd say, 
in a 
most bewitching manner, well, let me see, what did you 
have? there was— 
CHORUS. 
Roast pork, boiled pork. pickled eels, and treacle tart, 
Suet pudding, sheeps head, a 
glass of sherry wine, 
Steak pie, pig's feet, saveloys, and bullock's heart. 
Together with the waiter makes a 
dollar forty-nine. 
I 
gazed on her, I 
squeezed her hand, the pressure was re-
turned, 
Oh joy, to think the flame of love within her bosom burned 
I 
used to go there every day, to gaze upon my dear, 
She'd steal a 
wicked glance at me, and whisper in my ear— 
Roast pork, boiled pork, ite. 
I 
met her out at night and used to take her to the play, 
She ruined my digestion ere she named the happy day, 
I 
said, oh Jane, my pretty Jane, my pet, my turtle dove, 
Game dwell with me by rippling streams, and learn to live 
on love. 
i'POREN.—Live on love, she said, oh not for Jane, she 
prefers something more substantial, such as— 
Roast Part' boiled pork, &c.

Young Woman her name was Fan, That's the way the

goes. 
She fell 
in love with a 
man named Dan,

_ 
That's the

sto - ry goes; Now Pan loved Dan, and 
 
5  
Dan loved Fan. 
As true as 
wo-rnan e'er loved a 
man, And) 
-7--
Dan he kept a 
Chest-nut stand,Oh that's the way the sto-ry goes. 
• 
2. 
I'd like to get married," says Dan to Fan, 
That's the way the story goes, 
Say's Fan, " I 
quite approve of the plan,"--
That's the way the story goes. 
Dan said, " go get your parents' consent," 
Fan said " she would," and away she went 
Looking so fair and innocent,— 
That's the way the story goes. 
3. 
As Fan was going down Nassau Street, 
That's the way the story goes; 
Another Young Man she chanced to moot, 
That's the way the story goes; 
t•••• 
49 
He looked so shy and winked his eye, 
To escape his glances Fan did try, 
'T-was all in vain, he gave her a 
Pie,— 
That's the way the story goes. 
4. 
The Pie, it gained the heart of Fan, 
That's the 'way the story goes; 
The Rival of Dan was a 
Penny Pieman, 
That's the way the story goes. 
Fan gained her Father's and Mother's consent, 
To get married, and off with the Pieman went, 
But since that day she's had cause to repent,— 
That's the way the story gots. 
5. 
For coming away from Church that day, 
That's the way the story goes; 
A 
German Band began to play, 
That's the way th. story goes; 
And frightened it liorFe in front of a 
car, 
Knocked down and killed the poor Pieman. 
And made a 
widow of faithless Thin,— 
That's the way the story goes. 
6. 
Now, broken-hearted, about the streets, 
That's the way the story goes; 
Faithless Fan her Dan oft meets, 
That's the way the story goes. 
He heeds her not, but passes her by; 
.‘ Allhot! Two a 
penny !" she hears him cry; 
"And" she's sorry she ever took the pie,— 
That's the way the story goes,

Military Style 
As sting by Misi, Jennie Hughes. 
One day the Park while ranging, 
Close to the marble arch, 
The 9th. their quarters changing, 
I 
met upon the march, 
Their dresses gay my senses charmed, 
As they marched rank and file, 
I 
vowed to join them and adopt, 
Their Military Style. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, how do you like the military style girls, 
Oh, how do you like the military style, 
Blow the trumpet, beat the drum, 
See the conquering hero comes, 
Oil, how do you like the military style. 
To excursions Pm devoted, 
And always enjoy the day 
I'm sure to he promoted, 
For merit not for pay; 
I've read the deeds of General Grant, 
But in a

AWFULLY CLEVER. 
As sung by miss Jennie Hughes, 
I've a 
fellah who does'nt like bothah, 
All trouble to him is a 
bore, 
He's an income left him by his mothaw, 
What on earth could a 
fellah want more; 
His favorite sport's killing time, 
His aim's to do nothing at all, 
While some in this world run and climb, 
He takes the trip easy and crawls. 
CHORUS. 
For they tell him he's awfully clevah; 
Oh, so clevah, deuced clevah, 
They say that they nevah, no nevah, 
Met a 
fellah, so clevah before. 
Some fellahs go in for the Army 'I 
And some fellalis go in for trade, 
But he hasn't such bores to alarm him, 
His fortune was already made. 
And some fellalas go in far brain, 
And scribble to earn an honest penny, 
Those fellalis deserve all their gains, 
As for brains he could do without any. 
In the park he is often seen driving, 
He thinks he's Alexis, the duke, 
Whenever he goes in for billiards, 
Be thinks he's a 
hard one to fluke. 
Some times at an evening party, 
To keep us alive in he'll peep, 
Whenever we ask him to sing, 
We are certain to fall fast asleep,

Good-Bye, Charlie. 
OH, how I 
envy girls who have 
Their lovers close at home, 
While distance keeps me far from mine, 
Who o'er the seas muct roam; 
Should I 
but see him twice a 
year, 
Contented I 
must be, 
And hope he'll ne'er forget my words 
When last he went to sea. 
Good-bye, Charlie, when you are away, 
Write me a 
letter, love; send me a 
letter, 
love, 
Good-bye, Charlie, when you are away 
Do not forget your Nellie, darling ? 
How nice the drive, the game at chess, 
Or moonlight walk must be! 
How nice to have one's love " drop in" 
To take a 
cup of tea 
How nice to have sweet billet-doux 
Arrive by ev'ry post! 
The whilst poor me can but expect 
Just two a 
year at most. 
Goodbye, Charlie, Itc. 
It's hard to see such swarms of swells, 
Who stay at home at ease, 
The while my darling has to sail 
The wide and stormy seas. 
But I 
suppose it would not do 
For all to stay at home, 
And so I 
can but hope my love 
Ere long will cease to roam. 
Good-bve, Charlie, Sto, 
ktroqic pribilshed by Warm a 
uotriaArro. Roston, User, 
I'VE been thinking of late, I've been thinking. 
My thoughts I 
can scarcely d2fine, 
I've been thinking why people can wonder, 
At this terrible increase of crime; 
Crier, Old Uncle Sam it's a " poser," 
There's a 
something I 
can't understand, 
I 
would just give a 
trifle to know, sir, 
Why crime should increase in our iand. 
I'm sure that we've plenty of gold, sir, 
Our banks are as full as can hold, sir, 
We could buy the whole world I 
am told; sir, 
Yet still, there's an increase of crime. 
It's true what you say, Uncle Samuel, 
We've plenty of gold laid away, 
Moukly with mildew and rust, sir, 
Guarded by 
ht and by day; 
While you, like a 
dog in the manger, 
our gold to yourself you confine, 
When a 
little would make a 
great cha.nge, sir, 
In this terrible increase of crime. 
For expenses you don't care a 
groat, sir, 
Politicians, you feed a 
whole lot, sir, 
While the poor man, with hunger may rot, str, 
And still you wonder at crime-
I 
am sure yon will own Uncle Sam, sir, 
Temptation is hard to resist, 
Just look at our poor working girt., sit, 
Striving her best to exist' 
57 
Can you wonder at weak constitutions, 
When blood-sucking firms, barely give, 
Enough to keep off destitution, 
A 
girl, though she's poor, she must live. 
There's our poor needle girl, God defend Mr, 
With feelings as proud and as tender, 
As your proud city lady, remember, 
Uncle Sam can you wonder at crime. 
Can you wonder at crime can you wonder, 
When you gee the police on his beat, 
Arresting a 
poor starving man, sir, 
For begging his bread on the street; 
While the thief on the corner stands grinnini, 
In the broad open light of the day, 
Your pockets he'd pick for a 
shilling, 
And the law cannot touch himIthey say. 
He smiles with contempt and derision, 
He defies a 
whole police division, 
While the poor man is sent off to prison, 
And still you wonder at crime. 
Just think while your drinking your wine, sir 
How the poor of our land t'a.3y are fed, 
While you, with your rich folks can dine, sir, 
'is a 
god-send for them to get bread; 
Go visit the home of the poor, sir, 
Such sights you will never behold, 
'To our prisons then go and explore, sir, 
And scatter your hoardings of gold. 
A 
little would soon break asunder, 
The chains the poor sufferer la under. 
Go, list to that great voice of hunger, 
And you'll wer more wonder at crop
