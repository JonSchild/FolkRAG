Albert Biale, Eureka, NV 
Fieldworkers: Andrea Graham and Blanton Owen 
Born and spent whole life in Eureka. His dad started store in 
1903, the year Albert was born. Dad always wanted a store after 
an experience in Mercer, Utah. Before had worked on ranches and 
in mines. Department store in Mercer, dad was there and just 
about to leave, had promised to come back and work hoist at 
Diamond Mine near Eureka. Went into department store in Mercer, 
an Austrian woman was there, and no one could speak her language. 
His dad _nterpreted, she bought a lot of things, and the boss 
offered him a job. He liked the work, and was there about a year. 
The man at the Diamond Mine wanted him back, and because he had 
promised to return he went. Dad liked working in stores, and 
started his own in Eureka when he got the chance. Father's name 
was John Battista Biale, from near Genoa. Mother's name was Laura 
Bonetti, her parents were Swiss Italian. Father born in Santa 
Justina (?) 
Italy, 60 miles from Genoa. Mother born in this 
country, her mother born in Switzerland. His mother's parents ran 
a boarding house, Bonetti died at age 42, then his wife ran the 
house alone. 
Albert's father's father was also named John, came to Eureka 
in the 1870s to burn charcoal for use in 2 big furnaces and 5 or 
6 smaller ones. Worked at  Fish Creek, near where_Char-coal War 
took place. He was here 4 years, went back, then his daughter and 
her husband came over (last name Pescio). When Al's dad was 14, , 
he came over to be with his sister, went to school here starting 
in first grade, learned English quickly. Three years later, 
sister and brother-in-law were trying to buy Pinto Creek Ranch, 
but couldn't work out terms; they then went back to Italy, but  
his dad wouldn't go, so had to burn charcoal, work on ranches and 
in mines to make a living. 
After he came back from Mercer, he boarded at Louisa 
Morgantini's (formerly Bonetti, had remarried) and met Al's 
mother there and got married. Morgantini was running a saloon in 
IAW-AG-AO01 - 
2 
the front of the boarding house, when he died in 1902, Al's dad 
was offered the saloon but he preferred to start a store. Al's 
dad born 1871. Called Eureka Cash Store. Sheep came in 1910, 
Basque herders brought in, Al's dad saw the potential for 
business and stocked groceries and supplies for the sheepmen. 
Sheepmen from Elko would arrive with empty wagons and load up at 
the store. Not mangy Italians in sheep business, almost all 
Basque. Very few sheep left anymore, he blames overgrazing; 
Depression also started the decline. 
Al graduated from high school in 1921, had worked as a 
delivery boy, and started full time in the business at the store 
the day after he graduated. Delivered with horse and wagon, then 
with truck in 1920. His dad brought in 30 train car loads of 
merchandise a year; feeds, stock salt, flour, food, canned goods, 
lumber, mining supplies, dynamite. Narrow-gauge Eureka-Palisade 
Railroad was main transportation, brought supplies by train, 
bought in entire carloads of supplies to save costs. Sold guns, 
ammunition, groceries, tents, pack saddles; did not sell dry 
goods or feeds. Building in now Al's Hardware; was originally a 
saloon and boarding house, 1879 fire gutted the building, but it 
was stone so Bonetti and his partners took the second story off 
and put a new roof on. Saloon in front, rooms in back. 
Married 1925. His family also owned buildings across the 
street, used as warehouses. Mouse-proofing buildings to store 
flour. His dad's brother came out to Eureka, blacksmith and 
carpenter, worked on ranches; also named Albert. Hard worker, 
tended to drink too much in town. Italians came to Eureka to work 
mainly as charcoal burners or stonemasons; also some German 
stonemasons. Comments on quality of stonework. His house is built 
of tufa, volcanic stone; soft and easy to work, but no good for 
foundations. Doesn't remember names of any Italian builders in 
town.

lumber came from California. Their store sold lumber from about , 
1928 to 1941. Cash store from 1903 to 1946; then changed to 
hardware business; Al's son-in-law Jerry White now runs it, but 
does more work as an electrician. He has three kids: a son 
Arthur, who lives in town, the daughter married to Jerry White, 
and another daughter who was a teacher and lives in Carson City. 
Houses built into tufa cliffs above town. Most houses had a 
cellar dug into the hill also. There were 2 slaughterhouses in 
town for fresh meat. He remembers marble block in back of store, 
and being sent for a shank by his mother; the owner would give

him a taste of homemade bologna. Everything was in bulk in 
stores--beans, rice, dried fruit, soda crackers -- not packaged 
like today. Change in prices. Lot of Italians raised a pig, 
butchered for sausage. Baked bread in outdoor bake ovens. His 
grandmother had one -- start a fire early in the morning while 
bread was rising, rake out coals and ashes, wiped out ashes with 
a wet burlap sack on a paddle, tested temperature with a piece of 
paper bag. Put loaves in on paddle, made his sister and him a 
small loaf. All ovens are gone, Gibellini's had one, and there 
was one near the museum owned by a family that used to sell bread 
(Capriola family, now in Elko). Joe Capriola bought out Garcia, 
store in Elko still called Capriola's. 
His parents spoke Italian quite a bit; his grandmother spoke 
only Italian, had little formal education. She spoke a Swiss 
dialect. Other kids made fun of Italian language, called them 
Dagos, so they dropped the language and most kids didn't keep it 
up. Memories of his grandmother, buying him a bicycle he wanted, 
and a new saddle. Died at age 72, hard worker. 
Italian community: more so in early days, by his time kids 
got Americanized. Italian Benevolent Society, might have had a 
band, quite a few good musicians. Charcoal burning was a hard 
life, had just beans and rice and salt pork and cornmeal to eat. 
Cut wood, ricked up, covered with dirt, had to be watched so it 
wouldn't catch fire. Charcoal would ring like a bell in sacks, 
r' —still can be found outman the hills. Claims there were no trees 
left for 50 mi Fes 
town, all current forest is second 
growth. Burners lived in the hills, some had rock houses or 
Q 
tents. Burners asked for a raise, middlemen were making more tha 
the cutters. Smelters would not agree, so cutters protested and 
organized. Sheriff's posse went out one day near Fish Creek, no, 
one knows what happened, but five charcoal burners were killed: 
Known as the Eureka Charcoal burner's War.

Charcoal burners killed by the posse could not be buried in the 
Catholic cemetery. His grandmother used to take him when she put 
flowers on their graves, so he knew where they were and told the 
museum so they could put up a marker. War was in 1879; he got on 
museum board and wanted to mark the grave. His sister married 
Charlie Vaccaro, and his memory of the grave location was the j 
same as Al's. They marked the location, and put up a stone 
monument with a plaque.

ine makign 
his dad did a couple of times, but not much. 
Stillspr-oh-rbltion was a big mistake, couldn't stop it, and 
some people to drink who might not have otherwise. A big 
scale outfit near Pinto Creek, had a man from Tennessee running 
it. Smaller businesses would get caught, but big outfits could 
pay off police. Liquor from the big still was sold first in Ely, 
then Reno. Al's store sold sugar and kegs to the makers. Still 
was there for 3 or 4 years. Jack Dempsey story -- came through 
F •-s 
town one night, Al saw him the next morning drive in a big car. 
The still used 60 100 pound sacks of sugar a week, and several 
loads of 10 gallon charred oak kegs. Good whiskey, made from corn 
they bought in Ely, in great demand. Tennessee whiskey maker was 
named Gus Johnson. 
Music: usually piano, saxophone, trumpet, drum at dances 
when he and his wife first got together. Had dances on New 
Year's. St Patrick's, Fourth of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving 
were big dances, but almost every Friday night there was some 
kind of dance. Lots of men in town, especially when the roads 
were being built, and mines were active. 1923-27 were busy years. 
Dance hall called The Pavilion, on east side of street south of 
the post office, a large sheet iron building, built by the rescue 
hose company, 60 by 100 feet, 25 foot stage. He recalls Fourth of 
July dances with so many people you could hardly move in there. 
Eureka social center was opera house/theater: masquerade balls, 
IAW-AG-A002 - 
2 
graduations, school plays. Cars, radio and television have 
changed the social scene more than anything. No movies in Eureka 
until 1915, 2 or 3 times a week. Electricity came in with direct 
current first about 1925, had limited uses. Changed to AC in 
1948. 
Eureka never had over 700 or 750 permanent residents as long 
as he's been there. By 1885, population had dropped dramatically 
from its peak, and declined from then. There have been small 
mining rebirths, but nothing major. Ruby Hill going in 1940s, 
lead and silver; also zinc during the war. Water in mines caused 
them to shut down. 
Floods in Eureka. He recalls one in 1926, 2 people drowned. 
Water came down canyon, dammed up and finally broke. He has lived 
in the house since 1926, a year after he married Marie Harris. 
Her folks were miners from Ruby Hill, Cornish. Ruby Hill was 
owned by English miners, her grandfather was a hoisting engineer. 
Her mother's side were named Moyle. Al's house was originally the 
office and home of the superintendent of the Eureka Consolidated 
smelter, which was on the hill across the street. After mine shut 
down, the bookkeeper lived there and controlled the leases on the 
mines. Smelters were for lead and silver. Crowds in town in the 
old days; why was town built where it is, and why are streets so 
narrow. 
SIDE 2 
He doesn't know who built the house; frame addition built by 
an Irish carpenter. When he was young, the mills were gone, but 
the furnaces were still standing, round and built of fireproof 
rock. It was a good place for kids. They used to wait for train, 
built a fire below the hill and the livery stable man would see 
the smoke and think the train'was coming in, and rush down to 
find that it would be an hour late. One time the fire got away 
from them. 
Been in Eureka all his life, never traveled much after the 
first few years of marriage. He never went back to the old 
country. 
Ruby Hill mines were all English, and Prospect/Diamond Mine 
was mostly Italians. His dad worked there some. A friend of his 
father's took him to Salt Lake in 1897 for the 50th anniversary 
of the Mormons' arrival; that is how he eventually got to Mercer 
and the store. His dad says if the store incident had not 
happened, he might have gone into ranching; he did get the Pinto 
Creek Ranch in 
1933 when the Basque owner ran out of money, ran it for 10 years, 
loved the work.

Tony had the Tonkin, later Tony had a ranch at Palisade, and Pete 
got Dry Creek. Talk about Benny Damele, good friend of Al's son 
Arthur. Sold Tonkin, Willow Creek, and Three Bar Ranches. Steve's 
son Leo just sold a ranch near Palisade (Rand Ranch), his son Leo 
Glynn works in Eureka. Some relatives also ranch in Diamond 
Valley. Pietrina Damele married an Etchegaray, still in town

, 
Victoria and Camille both born and raised in Dayton. Her parents 
from Lucca, Italy, in the Tuscany region. Camille's parents were 
Basque; mother Spanish Basque and father French Basque. Her 
father came to San Francisco, where his nephew was. Worked there, 
in Los Banos, San Joaquin Valley, then Verdi and Dayton, Nevada. 
Lived in Sutro, raised potatoes using hot water from Sutro 
Tunnel, and took them to Virginia City to sell at boarding houses 
and hospital. Made enough money to send for her mother in Italy.

her once. He never forgot her, and wrote for her hand and sent 
money from America, and she came. This was in 1920 -- they were 
married in 1920, and moved to Dayton. 
He had a small ranch, raised vegetables and fruit to delive 
to Carson City. Seasons were more stable then, better growing 
season. Later had a little grocery store, specializing in Italian 
products -- cheeses, salami, prosciutto (he made himself), past 
olive oil. yctoria helped with bookkeeping in_the- Stowe)until 
they retired. She had three children, was married for 18 years. 
Camille had two boys. it is the second marriage for both. Other 
Dayton natives: Mr. Ricci, Ray Walmsley. 
Large Italian community, all ranches were Italian, a few 
worked on-railroad. There used to be a large Chinese community; 
story about an old Chinese man with pigtails, carrying water 
buckets with a yoke. A few Italians came over, sent for families, 
and eventually a large -community was established. Most from same 
area of Italy. When her father arrived, the community was pretty 
well established. Dayton used to be the county seat, until ca. 
1915. Trains -- big deal when someone arrived or left.

Most ranchers were truck farmers, potatoes, vegetables, 
orchards (peaches, pears, plums, cherries, apricots) -- not much 
livestock. Valley was sheltered, good soil, water from Carson 
River. Grew huge watermelons; story about her father checking 
ripeness by cutting a hole in a watermelon, she watched closely 
and tried to help by cutting little windows in lots of them, 
ruined part of the crop. She was an only child. 
Sc Arta_ Maria _Day:_ItaLtan_rancher-s-_had. open house, used big 
living rooms, big tables and benches, loaded tables with food
-
(ravioli, turkeys, hams, chicken, homemade breadmade—i_n _outdc2r 
ovens). She thinks Ricci Ranch still has an oven standing. Time 
consuming to make all the food -- she and her daughter will be 
starting Friday to make ravioli for Thanksgiving. All ranches had 
open house, then tables pushed back for dancing. One or two 
people playing accordion, or some had full orchestras. Mostly 
local people playing; Druids Hall in Dayton used to have a dance 
with Tony Pecetti Orchestra from Reno. Whole families came, kids 
slept on benches. People came from all over, from California --
like a family reunion, people they saw once a year. No other 
Santa Maria celebrations, August 15. Started with a Mass; then 
horse racing, contests 
bocce ball, turkey shoots. Tombula = 
game, like bingo, numbers picked; played on ranches in the 
winter, prize was a turkey. Used to have a carnival once a year, 
maybe on Santa Maria Day (she can't remember). 
Other holidays: Italians has spaghetti/pasta aschutta (dry 
pasta). Most made their own pasta.

Some people had stills during 
prohibition; they were t e only ones with money. Few alcoholics, 
Italians and Basques had a glass with their meal and that was it; 
kids started young, not a big deal, not forbidden. If somebody 
came visiting during the day, they were offered a glass of wine 
and pie, cake or cookies.

similar to a sugar ice cream cone. Mother made apple pies, sponge 
cake, but no cakes with frosting. Camille's mother used to make 
layer cakes, they lived just up the hill, and she would run up. 
Praderes were sheepherders, had lots of help to feed, so lots of 
food. 
In old country, Christmas was on Jan. 6, Epiphany. Had a 
Befana, similar to Santa Claus, but like a witch; kids would sit 
in front of fireplace, close eyes, wait for Befana, parent would 
drop a rock down the chimney to say she was there, then kids 
would go to bed. She filled a basket with oranges, apples, nuts, 
pine cone if they were very good; bad kids got coal and rocks. 
She does not know if Befana tradition was carried on here, but 
very similar to Santa Claus- and easily transferred. A cousin of 
hers said her family had a doll that was brought out every year, 
played with for a few days. Kids didn't have much, very poor. 
Families supportive, traded work, visited and played games 
in the evening, made their own entertainment. Didn't have to loc 
houses, no stealing. People today don't take care of homes, move 
around more; then they knew the house would stay in the family. 
Riccis are only Italian family left in Dayton from the old days. 
Alda Sbragia and her family had the Dayton Inn, her uncle and 
father had a ranch here; she came over as a young woman. Joe 
Ricci, wife Grace not Italian, two sons. 
Large mills used to be on the Carson River, to process ore 
from Comstock mines.

Fieldworker: Andrea Graham 
Work in Dayton -- mainly railroad, mills, ranches. Stores in 
town, blacksmith. Water tank above town, froze in winter, kids 
went skating. Blacksmith cut ice in winter, stored in ice house 
with sawdust, sold the rest of the year. Bars, butcher shop in 
town. Not much to hold kids in town when they grew up. Only job 
for women was teacher or nurse. 
Question about Italian stonemasons: she doesn't know, but 
Camille says.a lot of them knew how to be stonemasons. 
"Everybody_'s__a 
--- goddamn stonemason." Ricci's house is stone, but 
they don't know of any"specific Italian masons who built stone 
buildings in town. Camille: "Even over there, everybody that had 
a pile of sand__and-a_littl_e-b- t_nf  
gravel and] a sank of cement 
and  
they're always fooling with it." It Italy, very little wood, 
so stone and marble used- for building. Mountain near from where 
her mother is from in Italy is marble, she thought it was snow in 
the summer. Her mother's house had a circular marble staircase 
which she saw. Her mother's father came to America for ten years 
and went home, made money to bring back, and then built a house 
that was very fancy in its time. Lots of marble -- counter tops, 
stairs, floors, etc. They visited a friend in Italy, he showed 
off his house with a hardwood floor, which cost a fortune -- he 
thought that was the ultimate, like building with marble here. 
Victoria still has relatives in Italy. Her mother and uncle 
were only two kids, their father came to America for ten years, 
u,Tt 
then went back and had two more girls. Victoria cared for her 
►-`• 
parents until they died, but they never went back to Italy 
because he was still worried about being caught. His name was 
Della Santa. Victoria and Camille went back once before her 
parents died, and several times since, to see her two aunts, who 
reminded her of her mother. "You felt ]jeX 
you_were-going home.' 
People very friendly, she felt they were a part of her. She had

written them for years, and was glad to get to know them. One 
aunt died last year, and the other is sick now; she may never go 
back. She would like cousins to come here to visit. The trip to 
Italy is very long and tiring. S e calls Italy every few months. 
They have been to lots of places in Italy, grateful for the

Camille was raised in a house on the hill above where they 
now live, with his sister. Two boys whose parents died in the flu 
epidemic were taken in and raised by his parents. He lived in the 
same house when he married his first wife, and still took in 
children like his parents had. Some parents would go off for 
weeks and just leave their kids, others in town would look after 
them. One of the two boys went into the Army eventually, has been 
overseas, and would plan his vacations to coincide with their 
trips to Europe to he could show them around Germany, Italy, 
France, Austria, Switzerland. Also went to the Basque country in 
the Pyrenees to see Camille's relatives. 
She speaks Italian quite fluently, spoke it at home with her 
parents. Some families made a point of speaking English with 
their kids, but she did not know any English when she started 
school. She was an only child, Italian was spoken in the town 
Other kids teased her. Her teacher learned as much Italian as 
Victoria did English, had to spend two years in first grade until 
she learned English. Some kids spoke Italian, especially the more 
recent arrivals. Most have lost it, even her kids have lost the 
language, although they used to speak it with her parents. 
Victoria and Alda Sbragia in Dayton sometimes talk in Italian 
just to keep in practice, and'she writes to Italy and calls, 
which also helps. In Europe, everyone speaks several languages. 
SIDE 2 
Her father's name was Vittorio (Victor) and her mother's name was 
Assunta Bagniatori (?), father's last name was Della Santa. The 
name was originally Santa, but "A little royalty got mixed up in 
it somehow" and they added the Della to differentiate their 
family from the other Santas. She named her son Victor after her 
father. 
Camille has a small ranch,__a .few-cows__and 40-50 head of

in town, enough to keep them busy; they are semi-retired. Cold 
temperatures last winter, Dayton had 40 below for two days, 
colder then surrounding areas, killed trees and bushes; very 
unusual, coldest she remembers. Used. to have big snows, colder; 
seasons were more clear-cut, summers very hot. Story about 
keeping the stove hot in the winter in uninsulated houses; once 
the door cracked because it was so cold outside and so hot 
inside. Used to be thick ice, good for skating. She doesn't 
remember strong winds when she was younger, except when fall 
turned to winter and cold winds came in. Weather varies more now 
than in the past, "you can't depend on it."

Louis Gibellini in Prospect, five miles southwest of Eureka, NV 
Fieldworkers: Andrea Graham, Blanton Owen, David Taylor, John 
Williams. 
Talking about the house he was born in, one of the few still 
standing in Prospect. He thinks his parents built the house. 
There were six kids in the family, four girls and two boys. There 
used to be buildings all around the area, but most are gone. He 
thinks about 100 people used to live there, mostly Italians, a 
few Englishmen who lived on the hill. The bosses of the mine were 
English. A man named Behrman or Berryman lived in a house above 
Louis', he was the boss of the Diamond Mine. 
His father ran a pack train of mules hauling ore out of the 
mine. Ore was shipped to smelters in Salt Lake when he was 
growing up, because the Eureka smelters had shut down. Louis owns 
a mine claim 26 miles to the south. They used to go up to caves

natural caves in the mountains. Louis worked in the Diamond Mine 
at Prospect until about 1967, that was the last work that was 
done. Three or four bedrooms in the house; used wood stoves, 
candles. Kitchen, dining room; cellar behind kitchen to keep food 
cool. Spring was up behind the house, carried water for drinking 
and the garden. Had cows and horses around. School was below 
caretakers house. There was a post office up on the hill, in part 
of the generator building. No store in Prospect, had to go to 
Eureka; stock up for the winter. Looking at cellar behind the 
house, half underground, behind the kitchen, stored vegetables, 
canned food. Bought fruit from Eureka; had hay delivered for 
stock, there used to be a barn below the house. 
Prospectors all over the hills, shipped ore to Salt Lake, 
loaded in bins and put 
ni 
trucks. 42 miles of workings in the 
mountain, shafts that go down 700 or 800 feet. Headframes were 
inside tunnels that went back into the mountain, he knows of an 
antique steam hoist with flat cables still there. Most of the 
workings are still open. He used hand tools until 50 years ago, 
very little mechanical equipment. In a day, could drill 3 or 4 
feet in soft rock by hand, if hard could be only six inches. 
Drilling a face: sometimes just do half a face in hard rock and 
blast, do the other half the next day. Usually 15 or 20 holes to 
break the whole face. Blast center out first, then everything 
breaks to the center. Timed lengths of fuse, center blasted first 
and bottom last; each fuse lighted separately. About 20 years 
ago, two miners got blasted because they didn't get out in time 
He says the work isn't dangerous if you know what you are doing. 
He never had any bad accidents, but has seen some. cave-ins,

blockages, things falling down shafts. Underground mining a thing 
of the past, now all open pit. "All these mines were -mined- out

that time we enjoyed it, we didn't know any better." 
There used to be a big boarding house on the hill, above the 
generator building; still some old lumber left. Had 20 or 30 
rooms and a cookhouse, miners lived there. Two stories tall, 
single miners lived there; most were Italian. People spoke 
Italian in Prospect, but Louis says he always answered in 
English, and school was in English. Teachers were not Italian, 
boarded with families. About 25 or 30 kids in the school; he has 
photos, his granddaughter has them now. Just one teacher for all

dressed in the photo is "comical." 
No autos, everything transported with teams. Fun being a kid 
in Prospect, originated their own fun. Summer at the Windfall 
over the hill, garden, cows, made cheese; had a house there. 
SIDE 2 
Every family_.had_a_gar_den at the Windfall, went there for 
the summer. There was also a mine at the Windfall, discovered in 
1906. Men walked back and forth to work. Snow was 3 or 5 feet 
deep in winter. Took cows south in winter, turned loose to graze 
and gathered up in spring. Most families had 4 or 5 cows for 
beef, kept milk cows in Prospect for the winter, turned loose in 
spring, kids had to bring them in to be milked. 
(Walking up to former mine superintendent's house above 
Louis'). Winters milder now, seem to be getting milder all the 
time. They used to get snowed in at Prospect, hardly any way of 
getting out. Ground has been pushed around recently with a 
bulldozer. Old foundations of other buildings. Stairs up to 
platforms -- former porches for buildings. Used to be miners' 
cabins around for prospectors, no insulation; had to carry all 
water. (Looking at artifacts around house). Kids used to dig

Pete Delmue, Delmue Ranch, Lincoln County, NV 
Fieldworkers: Andrea Graham, Blanton Owen, David Taylor 
(Walking around the ranch talking about the various 
buildings). Low shed that used to be off the cellar in front of 
the house. Horse stable/old barn, one section used as an ice 
house, ice cut from a pond that used to be below the house and 
stored in sawdust all summer. Old--brands—on stable: JD for Joe 
Delmue, Pete's grandfather, 
ete's nephew still uses the_­ brand -,. 
Big barn: large doors in gable fold down to get hay in. His 
grandfather was working up there and fell once and broke his hip. 
Story about a dog that used to climb the ladder up the wall to 
the hay door, played with kids in the hay. (Opening door). Grain 
was kept on one side, other side had stalls for horses, both work 
teams and saddle horses. Wood and wire "nets" hung from track 
along ridgepole, were laid on wagons, loaded with hay, hauled up 
with a pulley and dumped in the barn. Pete stacked as a kid, 
filled up to the very top so just a trough was left for the nets 
to run through. Barn is 90 feet long. Railroad track ran out the 
back to run carts of hay out to mangers to feed. Stanchions in 
back of barn for milk cows, stanchions made of railroad rails. 
Italians who worked in the mines all year, wanted to get out 
in the air and took their vacations at the ranch pitching hay. 
His grandfather went back to Italy several times and brought back 
others with him when he returned -- Andy Zambelli, Leo Rodoni 
(?). many of them looked on the Delmue Ranch as home. Other 
Italian ranch -- Fogliani. Stuzzeneggar was German/Swiss -- had 
place now owned by the state parks. Most Italians in the area 
worked in the mines. 
Roof poles_  came from_Wi_lson_Sreek, ponderosa pine for—lumber 
from Gleason Canyon. Railroad ties from old narrow

tEat ran to_mills, got ties when the tracks were torn out and 
rails as well. Feeding troughs on east side of barn -- doors open 
to outside yard where weaners were kept and fed. Pete doesn't 
IAW-AG-A006 -

know of any other big barns in the area. Rocks moved with hay 
derrick to form pillars in barn. Pillars have narrow gauge rails 
along their edges, tied together through rocks and mud to hold 
together. Pete uses scrap lumber from the ranch in his new house 
in Pioche -- barn lumber for basement paneling. (closing barn 
door) . 
Pete w_as_62_ n_Octoher. Going through gate, pivots on a pin 
set into a rock. Notches cut into rock, maybe for another gate. 
Pete moved from the ranch in 1965, lived in Eagle Va-1ley_for _7 
years, then to Panaca_and built two houses, then one in Wyoming, 
the current one in Pioche is "the last one." First barn, used for 
milk cows. He cleaned the manure off the floor when he was about 
17, found the floor was all cobblestone, with a stone trough, 
"just 1ike—gin-the-o 
country." Roof rafters were made of 
railroad rails, last spring e took them off and built a loading 
chute with them. All built with square nails, he used lots in his 
house. This barn was the first, then the stable, then the 1888 
barn, then the big barn. 
Pond below house, froze in winter, they cut chunks with 
saws. The first house was down near the pond, in the trees. His 
grandfather als-o-had a saloon, served the  woodcutters making 
charcoal in the area. Needs to feed cows in the corral, culled 
out to be sold in Cedar City, UT. His qrandfa-ther-had_a_pigeon

former milk cellar with a spring he pushed in, old shed. Sold 
milk and cheese in Pioche. 
Going toward house. He needs to fence his property in the 
canyon, arguing with the Bureau of Land Management over 
ownership. Used to swim in creek/pond, not kept cleared out now 
because they don't put up ice any more. Looking at garden, now 
gone to pasture. Grew spices -- saffron, sage. Pete's father used

When Benny's dad u_ 
ent main 
ranch buildings were built; tii•- _ 
john Hickison 
at the time. The old part of the current .ltdlll *,,vase was built 
after 1907; he thinks there is a date of 1910 on the cement of 
the porch, but he knows it took longer than a year to build 
because of all the other work to do on the ranch. The walls are 
30 inches thick. Benny's family added on the railroad tie part on 
the rear and the rock extension out the front after they bought 
it in 1942, and moved in May 1943. The original house had a dirt 
roof, which is still there under the newer metal one. There was 
no lawn and no trees when they bought it. The cellar was also 
there when they bought it; he thinks they built it first and 
maybe lived in there until the house was done. The chicken house 
may have been a bunkhouse at one time. He thinks they built 
little by little, and by about 1914 everything was pretty well 
done; the stable has 1912 and/or 1914 dates. 
Matt Hickison did all the stonework, he was John's brother; 
old house, stables, shop, etc. Benny also owns the Ackerman 
Ranch, about ten miles to the northeast, and he has researched 
water rights so he has documents on the previous owners. Emil 
Baumann bought Ackerman from Frank Spencer in 1895, and Hickison 
bought it in 1907. A man named Bates built the original cabin at 
Dry Creek, he sold the ranch to John Spencer in 1899, and Spencer 
sold right away to Baumann in 1899, and Baumann sold to Hickison 
by 1907 (Benny does not have the records on that). Baumanns built 
IAW-AG-A007 -

the rock buildings at the Ackerman ranch -- they were Swiss. 
However, the stable was already there -- it is built of vertical 
logs, and the Dameles adobed the inside to hold it up. Benny 
thinks a man named Vanina built the log barn, he was Swiss 
Italian and he thinks he was originally a woodchopper, and just 
stayed when the  
smelters—shut down and._s EEted ranchi ng—and 
farming -- milk cows, made butter and cheese to sell in Eureka., 
Ownership of Ackerman and Dry Creek has tended to stay 
together, the same person has owned both most of the time, or 
brothers or other family members. Spencers went from there to the 
Grass Valley Ranch, to the north. Benny's father bought the two 
ranches at the--same—t ime, His father--use_d_to _12e—a-t--Three-Bar, 
where
-the family moved in 1898. After his father died, Benny's 
father an3 a brother ran Three Bar, until _Benny's dad bought Dry 
Creek. A number of  the ranches between Dry Creek and Pali sade 
were owned by members of the Damele family. Benny's father  
and 
his uncle Bernard were at Three $Ar, two other brothers owned the 
70-nkinE:Ranch, another brother owned a ranch at Palisade. There 
were other ranch owners in Pine Valley, so they were not all 
Dameles. His father's nieces also ranched in the area. A rancher 
named Ferguson's son married Benny's dad's sister (the Ferguson 
Ranch is between Ackerman and Three Bar). The  Santa Fe Ranch 
belonged to his father's sister and later was bought by her son-
Th-raw. The Tonkin and JD--Ranche--,--were D-ameles. 
v 
There are two Dameles left ranching, Benny and St ev ie who 
ranches in_Pine-va-l-ley. Stevie is moving to Idaho, but his uncle 
is going to live there. 
Mining on Roberts Creek mountains, Benny says they have 
"ruined it". They have to stop now, although it's too late to 
save it. "I don't like to see it done, but I don't like to see 
progress stopped either if it'produces something that's, you 
know, essential, well then it's got to be done, I guess. But, uh, 
I don't like it. That's a good mountain, good range." I explain 
the archaeological survey being done; he kids about 
archaeologists finding "old fire pits" that are really from 
sheepherders and not very old. 
"They burned coal there in that country," Rutabaga Canyon, 
and in the Tonkin drainage of the Roberts Creek Range. He has 
seen pits that were still full of 6harcoal'that had never been 
hauled out. His uncle used to go up from the Tonkin Ranch and 
fill a wagon with it and use it for the(t lacksmitY•jorg•1 Benny 
says charcoal won't rot and lasts for years. He cToes 
t'know why 
sometimes pits were used and sometimes ovens; maybe where there 
was more wood and more men they would build an oven. A lot more 
work to using a pit, but more work to build a kiln. Talking about 
the oven on the east side of Diamond Valley, which he knows about 
but has never seen.

His grandfather was from the province of Genoa in Italy, 
Ll 
town of "Alpicalla" (?), inland and a little north, not far from 
the Swiss border. He came here because a lot of his countrymen 
were here. "A lot of times I wondered, you know he crossed the 
whole United States, there's a lot of better country than this to 
settle in, look like to me, but he stayed here." His grandfather 
_ 
never had any other relatives here, he was an only child. 
Not many of the first generation of Italians were miners, 
they were mostly charcoal burners; the second generation had a 
lot of miners, or ranchers. Gibellinis and Borgnas and Vaccaros 
were miners, but their forbears were woodchoppers and packers. 
Others.were in the mountains and just stayed to become ranchers 
and farmers when the smelters shut down. The Italian Ranches just 
north of Eureka are still there, now main one is owned by a 
Baumann, third generation descendant of the Baumann who owned the 
Ackerman. Nearly every canyon north of there had a small ranch, 
there are still ruins left. 
He does not know who built the stone buildings in Eureka, 
but it could have been Italians. A lot of the stone was hauled 
from the east in White Pine County, where there was harder 
sandstone. The local Eureka stone was a very soft sandstone that 
crumbled badly. Arthur and Albert Biale in Eureka know about the 
Italian ranches, might be willing to go show us around. Al Biale 
is a "hell of a talker and a storyteller. and it's all gospel, 
too." Estelle Gensoli in Eureka was raised at the Italian 
ranches. Albert and Arthur are also good sources on the local 
wildlife, have been asked by professors for information. 
Benny and his brother hauled some cut blocks of sandstone• 
home one time, he has them down by the ranch gate. They are 
tapered and rounded for a pipe to go through, he thinks they were 
made for a mine perhaps. "Really a work of art." He also has some 
slag from the bottoms of slag pots used in the smelters. The rock 
for the addition to the ranch house came from right around the 
ranch; everyplace they went they'd pick up good rocks and haul 
them home, a lot came from Ackerman. Benny was about 13 when the 
addition was built; he was sent out to get "spalls", small rocks 
to shim the larger ones and fill in between. Addition built 1943-
44, the bunkhouse was built in 1943. The hole was already dug and 
the rock was there, so they just finished the job. His dad hired 
the same ranch hands as Hickison had used. A man named Hooley (?) 
built the bunkhouse and the house addition; he was Irish. Benny 
says there were a lot of Italian stonemasons, they 
were famous 
for their stonework. Nobody knows Italian stonPmason_fami_lies 
around Eureka, but _he_says they-all could-do--the--work. 
SIDE 2 
"No problem to build a rock wall. You take two little ones and a 
big one on top. Then you put one big one and two little ones on 
IAW-AG-A007 -

top.But it's not all that simple." He thinks a lot of the rock 
for the buildings on the ranch came from the old pony express 
station below the house. The remains are still there, as is a 
grave. 
Foundation of Eureka courthouse is huge limestone blocks, he 
doesn't know where:it came from; all done by hand. The courthouse 
was just being finished in  1879 when his grandfather arrived in 
Eureka,- after  
working to the nortli— in_ Alpha making charcaol for 
fi-ve or _si_x months  when he first got  to this country. He thinks 
there must have been charcoal burners in the old country, since 
the Swiss and Italians were brought over just for that job.

"Artists with an axe" he calls them. He says his  
dad was--'a

the chainsaws 
were out, I'd go the... my nephews and Chuck that was here, I had 
two chainsaws, so they run the chainsaws, I'd rather cut with  the 
axes just for the  fun of it." Talk about 
-f 
how to 
sharpen them, things he learned from his dad. Hard manual labor 
is twice as tough if you don't know the knack to it. Story about 
stacking loose hay that morning with his nephew, who Benny had to 
show some tricks to so he could do the job, since he'd never 
pitched loose hay. Have to know how, and how to put it on the•'•` 
wagon so it will stay. The old timers "got the most out 
t of the 
tool they had." 
i 
Yearly cycle of working cows. In January, just feeding hay, 
keep cows, calves and bulls separate, all kept pretty close to 
the ranch or at Ackerman. Usually late March or April, brand fall 
calves, feed them outside until the weather gets warm and they 
move off, up the mountains for the green grass after the snow 
melts. A lot go down to the flat, they will be moved out the end 
of May. In June, gather on the mountains into corrals he has 
scattered around, brand the calves; move in a circuit from south 
to north, finish up at Ackerman, done by mid to late June. From 
then on, don't even look at the cattle, start haying. Starting in 
August, the feed dries up and they move down to the flat. 
September he'll start gathering up and putting them in the 
crested wheat fields below the house and along the highway, then 
will gather a load of yearlings to sell, fall steers from the 
year before, he will sell them in October. In November, they wean 
the calves, this year they did a lot of work because he wanted to 
cut back the herd because of the dry year and his health. Calves 
are brought home during November, by early December have them all 
gathered and weaned. (Valerie Parks arriving). Ready to ship be 
December, now waiting for trucks and veterinarian to vaccinate 
the heifers. Will be moving one bunch out of the crested wheat 
and bring up near the house, after that, "just wait for the big 
snow." Always a little different each year. (Valerie arriving, 
IAW-AG-A007 - 
5 
introductions). 
Calves are born between end of March to first of November; 
bulls put in early June, removed in February. A lot of people, 
"more modern ranchers", want all their calves born within 60 days 
or so. But he has no place to hold the bulls, they don't "bull 
up" very well outside, and the yearling market is pretty good, 
and he gets replacement heifers from the fall calf crop. Old cows 
are sold in Fallon; there is a buyer in Elko who buys yearling 
steers and weaners. "Yeah, I don't know, I, lot of people always 
wanting to increase their cattle and having trouble increasing, 
and me, I have more trouble keeping 'em down than I do 
increasing. I don't have no trouble gettin..." He says it is good 
country for cows, "an awful good mountain." People have been 
there a long time. Benny says you have to take care of the land, 
and the Bureau of Land Management comes and tries to tell him 
about it. He knows it is overgrazed this year, because nothing 
grew because of the drought. Next year, he will have fewer 
cattle, and with any precipitation there will be plenty of feed. 
The Bureau of Land Management has a system that does not really 
work for him, so they generally let him do what he wants. 
"There's no way that anybody can stay in business and abuse the 
country, you know, like they claim has been abused.I don't see 
how they can... I can't, I know if I do it, I'm out of business, 
I'm done." They have been doing-it for nearly 50 years, and it's 
still working. He says the Bureau of Land Management listens to 
him and lets him go, but if something happens to him, there will 
be big changes. "It won't be for the better, either." other 
ranches run things differently, lose a lot of cattle in the 
winter; he can't stand'to see livestock starve. "Like me, I can't 
stand to see livestock starve. I don't care whose it is, either. 
I don't care if it's my worst enemy, if that..if he's got a cow 
and I got one of his cows, that cow ain't gonna starve, that's 
all. Like my dad says, he said, 
'just cause you don't like 
somebody, he says, you don't go kick their dog'. He says, 
'That 
cow,' he says, 
'that cow don't know it belongs to an SB.' He said 
if you don't like him, go hit him, don't starve his cow." 
Neighbors have always looked out for each others' cows, 
return them when they get mixed in together. When Benny was a 
kid, nobody claimed any individual range, they all ran their cows 
together. He says it was like one big family. Most of the cattle 
stayed in a general area, all rode and branded together, sorted 
out pretty well by winter, but each family usually had a few of 
the others', and they all got fed. "It was one hell of a peaceful 
country, I'll tell you." It has changed a little, but it still 
works that way to a large extent. His cows and Molly Knudtsen's 
cows (from the Grass Valley Ranch over the hill to the north) 
sometimes get mixed up, and they will feed each others. Molly has 
some "funny ways" and has had run ins with most of the ranchers, 
but he lives with it.

Benny buys most of his hay, can't get good moisture any 
more. In a good year he can get 350 tons between Dry Creek and 
Ackerman, which will feed 350 head. He will buy the rest, this 
year 360 tons were bought. If it an easy winter, they don't have 
to feed too heavy. The last few years have been hard, have to 
start feeding early. In the past, used to be able to store hay up 
over the years, ready for a hard winter, didn't have to buy much. 
Hard winters of 1936-37, 1932, 1952, 1948-49. "Those years, boy 
you don't forget those dates. Boy they make it tough for you, 
holy mackerel." In the early years, hay wasn't baled and couldn't 
be hauled, so you had to bring the cattle to the hay instead of 
the other way around. Grass Valley had few cattle but cut a lot 
of hay, stacked loose. They sold hay, and ranchers had to move 
their cattle over there and leave a man there to feed. His father 
moved cattle to Duckwater one year, and to Beowawe, where they 
had bought hay. Tough moving cows home in the spring, muddy 
ground, calves being born, takes months. That was before his 
time. He gets hay from Diamond Valley usually, but this year got 
it from the neighboring ranch in the flat. Its a fairly new farm, 
high quality hay with no weeds, used for dairy cows, but he says 
it will kill his cattle with bloat. This year the first crop was 
a lot of grass and weeds, not good enough for dairy, but made 
good stock feed, so he bought it. Next year the rancher plans to 
plow it up, but Benny said he will buy the hay; however, they get 
more money for the straight hay. They get $90-$100 a ton this 
year for dairy hay; 
he bought early and paid $71 a ton, $80 
delivered. Fallon used to be the closest place to buy, had it 
delivered for $20. Used to be, $3,000 bought a good stock truck; 
the one he uses, a 1969, was under $4,000. Right now, it would 
cost $21,000 to $25,000.

December 10, 1989 
Fieldworkers: Andrea Graham and Blanton Owen 
Roberta Damele's father Peter Merialdo was interviewed by 
the University of Nevada Oral History program in Reno. 
John Damele born in Eureka in 1918, his folks owned the 
TonkinRanch - 54_miles north of town, where hewas raised-and 
went 
school for ten years. Later he and his 
--f 
and-two 
brothers were- partners in the ranch, and bought more ranches. He 
was in the_ranching-business until 1969, when they sold the 
ranches and motied__to.__Eu-r-eka-. They had a home in town, and Roberta 
and their kids lived in town when the kids went to school, and he 
would come in on weekends. His father was Steve Damele; Benny 
Damele's father  Peter 
_was _Steve!s-br2the.r. Steve had a twin 
brother Antone, and another brother Bernard, and there were three 
sisters. Steve_,__.Antone_and_Bernard were born in Italy. John had 
two sisters and two brothers, Charles, Leo, Pietrina (Etchegaray) 
and Margaret (Borgna) . All 1 
 
fired-in th.e area_;_the brothers were 
partners with_JQhn_on 
the-Tonkin, .TD, Sheep Creek and other 
ranches, all adjoining Tonkin. They raised cattle; at one time 
Steve, Peter and Bernard had sheep for about ten years, mainly to 
keep other sheep ranchers from using their range (1925-35). Three 
men came with the sheep and ran them. 
The first ranch the Dameles owned was the Three Bar, run by 
John's grandfather. Then John's father and uncle, Steve and Tony, 
bought the Tonkin and both lived there for quite awhile, and 
later bought a ranch near Palisade, to the north. The Tonkin 
Ranch is surrounded by mines now, but it is still operating. The 
Tonkin Springs Mine is the closest. 
Dan Russell owns the Tonkin 
Ranch now, along with lots of others in Eureka County. 
John's father spoke Italian, and John spoke and understood 
it 
pretty well when young. His grandfather came from Italy in 
the 1870s (he w.as_there_when tha-.-coilrthous--waG he--ng-bu•t in 
1879-) He worked cutting wood -for-char-coal-for-two winters, but 
IAW-AG-AO08 -

he preferred ranching. He  went back to Italy once, and then sent 
for his  
family to come over. They lived  in Eureka for  
awhile, 
then moved to Sulphur Ranoh (about 30 miles north), where Peter 
and the three girls were born. Bought the Three Bar and paid for 
it in two years, mainly selling hay to Cortez Mine for horses. 
Steve and Tony were known as teamsters, raised horses;  Benny's 
father Peter was "quite a cowboy." 
•T 
Raised cows and horses on the Tonkin ranch, some sheep. 
People raised hogs for sausage, hams, etc. His mother_ made 
cheese, most ranch women _did. His mother was a Mau, her father 
came from Germany, and her mother was from Ireland and was a 
schoolteacher at the Fish Creek Ranch. His father ranched in 
Newark Valley and was a partner in a store in Eureka. 
The man who owns Tonkin now doesn't raise many cattle. When 
the Dameles sold it in 1969 they had 3100 head, the herd has been 
steadily reduced since then, there are nc)w m,-
,,,gybe 400 or 500 head.

Interest in history, explanation of what we are interested in. 
John comments on changes on ranches, people don't work like 
they used to. He has seen big changes in raising hay, they used 
to raise 60,000 or 70,000 bales a year, "now they're lucky if 
they raise five." They don't work at it or irrigate, easier to 
buy it. "There are easier ways to make a living." Not as many 
changes in working cattle, still have to work on horseback, but 
trucks are used much more today, especially hauling horses to and 
from where the work is being done, instead of riding there and 
back. "I cowboyed nearly all mX_life, that's all I was, you might 
say,_is a cow-bow" John's brother Leo still has a ranch in Pine 
Valley, he is five years older than John. (Roberta has been 
looking for photos, but can't find more).

English until he started school, and then he lost the Italian. He 
had a hard time with the dialects when they went to Italy.

doesn't make them much any more because there are not enough 
people to cook for. They had two daughters, but there were lots 
of hands working at the ranch when they were there.

(Looking through recipes). Cookies. John's father made some 
wine at the ranch, mostly for the sheepherders, but not much for 
the family. John went to school (college) in California and used 
to visit Italian families there, all of whom made wine. Roberta 
had adapted one recipe to be made in the microwave, a rich 
cake/confection. 
Oral history of Roberta's father has the family history; he 
was born in Eureka, one of eleven kids his mother had in two 
marriages. Roberta's mother's family were Manns, probably McMann, 
her grandfather was Scottish, born in Canada. 
Looking for cookie recipes. John asking if Benny knew when 
their grandfather came to this country; I think 1879. Roberta is 
a good cook, according to John. Her family lived in town, she 
never lived on a ranch until she married John. Her father was 
county auditor/recorder for 31 years, then ran for state 
controller and served for eight years, died 1975. Her mother died 
last year, age 89. 
Blanton asking about a dessert recipe; Roberta talking about 
sweet bread made with pine nuts, her mother made six or eight 
loaves for-Christmas.. Marsala recipe a kind of pudding made with

ne Talking about being in Rome and smelling chestnuts from 
their hotel room, running down to get some being cooked on open 
charcoal brazier. Most chestnuts_bought to  
eureka _from 
California, John's family always had them  
at  Christmas. Food came 
in on the railrdoa 
in the old days. 
Roberta brings out another recipe file; the first was just 
pies, cakes and cookies, this is main dishes, plus she has lots 
of cookbooks. Inside cover of her  
eighth grade recipe colle c ti on 
has a notice "in case of poisoning..." Ladle-with-h-oles fox 
draining pasta called "carzaballa." Ravioli recipe, filling and 
pasta; spinach, chicken and brains used for filling. Calves 
brains hard to find now. 
(Andrea copying some recipes down). 
Zucchini put up in olive oil and garlic; frittata (like spinach 
souffle). Olive oil, garlic in most recipes. Good olive oil is 
Bertolli. Her grandmother just flavored olive oil with garlic, 
not a lot. His family made a flat bread called "figazza"(?), 
which someone at the Eureka Senior Center also makes now; like a 
pizza, with olive oil and salt on top.

John and Roberta Damele, Eureka, Nevada 
December 10, 1989 
Fieldworkers: Andrea Graham and Blanton Owen 
(Looking at recipes, Andrea copying them down) T4ey used to 
grow garlic, sweet basil (used in Genoese cooking). In_Lt-ly, 
"Each  area is  very sure (heir food is 
the beat."— Roberta never 
heard of oregano growing up, it is more associated with southern 
Italian cooking. John doesn't recall much garlic and onion in his 
family's cooking either; he says Americans use it much more than 
Italians. They  enjoyed the food in Italy because it tasted like 
what_they_were_used—to. 
Talking about handwriting, Palmer Method. John talking about 
his medication for emphysema and asthma, got worse three years 
ago. Almost died in the hospital, new medications, heart 
problems. 
Most Italians were Catholic, pretty involved in the church. 
Basques and Irish were also Catholic. They do not know who built 
the church in Eureka. John thinks there were Italian stonemasons 
in Eureka, edging around graves is cut stone. There was a quarry 
about 18 miles out of town where rock was hauled from, for 
foundations and buildings. Quarry was up Ratto Canyon, in the 
foothills; stone was soft, cut with axes. Quarry was toward Ely, 
turn on Fish Creek Road, go 1 or 1 1/2 miles, turn back north up 
Ratto Canyon. Stone was hauled with teams. There was also a tufa 
quarry nearer town; the Ratto Canyon rock was a soft sandstone, a 
better quality than tufa but still soft. 
John mentioned the name Capastori as a builder, stonemason 
and carpenter, about John's father's age. He built the old Eureka 
Garage, next to one of the motels, built of lumber; can't recall 
any stone buildings he built. Capastori was "quite a character," 
spoke broken English; also did some work in Austin. He used to 
travel to Austin with the Catholic priest, who drove fast, and 
Capastori would tell him to slow down: "Slow down, father, slow

down! He says, maybe you got a pull with God, but I don't." 
Roberta has some information on when and why her family came 
from Ital-y, a copy the oral history of her father. Roberta's' 
grandfather was born in Genoa, came to—US in_1878. (Talking about 
bread recipes, Andrea copying down.) Roberta's grandmother was 
first married to Luigi Rabagliatti, then later to Merialdo. 
Norman Rebaleati is Roberta's "half-cousin" still lives in town; 
his son Mike is the county recorder. Spelling of the name was 
changed. (Phone rings). In the oral history a bread oven is 
mentioned, and the way his mother checked the temperature. 
Roberta has an old rolling  
pin used for making ravioli and 
marking_tlhe s_quar_e_s; the lath P with hol-Ps fnr lift-ing 
ra-uinit-out 
of the water called a_car-zaballa.; a wheel f-or cuting_the ravioli 
apart. Now there are machines for making pasta. 
Roberta's grandfather first worked as a charcoal burner, 
then quit to work in the mines. They  later had a boardinq house, 
wh 
e r
e ffie 
Mt. Wheeler Power Co. is now. She remembers it burning 
down when she was four years old, across the street from her 
grandparents' house. She doesn't think they were still running 
the boarding house. She was born 1921, June 6. 
John's uncle Tony moved to Oakland, he thinks it might be 
interesting to track down the Dameles in California. John and 
Roberta's daughters: one lives in Diamond Valley (had an 
anniversary party there last year, about 90 people). 
SIDE 2 
Talking about other family members in the area: Bernard, 
Benny's nephew, and some of his siblings are still in town, one 
in Idaho and one in Reno. John's brother Leo just sold his ranch 
near Palisade, and bought another in Pine Valley, on the road to 
Elko. 
Recipe_for_panne dolce,_a sweet Italian bread,  
from her 
grandmother. Talking about Benny's cancer and chem o th era py ; he 
comes by to visit after his treatment each week. Sometimes John , 
and Benny used to work together, especially gathering cows. When 
John sold his ranch he bought a farm down in Diamond Valley, 
raised about 500 head of cattle and hay. Leased summer range from 
Bureau of Land Management that was right next to Benny. The 
difference between a ranch and a farm: John says "A ranch has 
gotta be cows." Farming to him is raising grain and crops, not 
livestock. John says he was a buckaroo, the northern Nevada term 
for a cowboy. John still has his saddle and gear; he never did 
any rawhide work or made mecartys, although some people did, 
"mostly Mexicans" that did the rawhide work and the silver. He 
IAW-AG-A009 - 
3 
used to make mecartys when he was a kid with his brothers. John 
used to carry a kind of hardtack bread, but Italian -- used to 
buy it, take it when they were riding, for lunch. 
Their daughter and her husband teach school in Eureka. She 
says Eureka is the only place where "you can get a wrong number 
and talk for half'an hour." 
Other_Italian familiesin_the-ranching business: Joe Peretti 
in Pine Valley, his son still owns the ranch; Tomeras in Lander 
County. A lot of Italians-were-miners, lived at Prospect/Diamond 
Mine: Borqna family,  Vaccaros, G_ibellinis.  prospect was Ita_IIan 
community, Ruby Hill was Irish, English and "Cousin Jacks" 
(Cornish). There were also Italian store  owner-_ and-boarding 
house  operators. Most Italians came-originally as -charcoal 
burners; many left when the smelters shut down, most went to 
California around the Bay Area .

Charcoal oven in Diamond Valley, he does not know anything 
about it, who built it, etc. There is another  canyon with three 
or 
_four ovens,-still-standing. John says he does not know why 
they used ovens some  
places and pits others: if there was plenty 
of wood in one place,  
lie-thinks they used the ovens, they were 
easier to control. But if there were just 50 or 60 cords of wnod 
they used the  pits and modve

Tonkin ranch, and some still had charcoal in them; they went and 
got the charcoal to use in their blacksmith shop. There were 
little 
^ log cabins_the•charcoal burners lived in,,  sometimes two  or 
three men would spend the winter there.

Siren blows; it goes off every night at 9 p.m.; Roberta says 
it used to go at 8 when she was little. They don't know why --
she says it's so you know what time it is; it used to be a signal 
that they had to go home. There is a Belli Canyon, Roberta says 
it is named for the father of attorney Melvin Belli. She tried to 
get him to come for the Centennial, but he couldn't. John and 
Roberta's older daughter lives in Walnut Creek, CA, but they are 
moving back to Colorado; her husband is a mining engineer, they 
move a lot; they will be in Eureka for Christmas on the way to 
Colorado, with their two kids.
