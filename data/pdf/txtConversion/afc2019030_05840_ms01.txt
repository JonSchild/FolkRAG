Lisa Gabbert and Mark Harris 
Brief Description of Contents:  Dr. Mark Harris is a clinical anesthesiologist. He talks about his 
own training in the medical profession, the daily stresses and anxieties faced by physicians, and 
the role he feels humor plays in maintaining a healthy perspective while routinely dealing with 
high stress situations. Dr. Harris shares his insights on humor serving as a coping mechanism for 
dealing with both performing his job, as well as his interactions with patients and easing their 
stresses and anxieties.

LG: 
So, this is Lisa Gabbert, and I am interviewing Dr. Mark Harris, in his home here in Salt 
Lake City. Today is September 6th, and this is for the project on Medical Folklore. 
 
 
Dr. Harris, you know you are being recorded –  
 
MH: 
Yes. 
 
LG: 
And may I orally have your permission to use this interview for research and publication 
purposes? 
 
MH: 
You have my permission. 
 
LG: 
Thank you. 
 
 
Okay, we will start off with just some background information. Could you please 
describe your medical background and training, including medical school, residency, 
fellowship training, and your current place of employment? 
 
MH: 
I attended University of Glasgow, in Scotland, for medical school from 1987 to 1992. I 
then spent four years doing the bits and pieces of an emergency medicine residency in 
Scotland. And then when we had our first child, my American wife and I moved to the 
States, so I had to start all over again with residency. And at that time, I decided to switch 
to anesthesiology. And so since 1998, I have been at the University of Utah as a resident 
and now as faculty in anesthesiology. 
 
LG: 
How long is the anesthesiology residency? 
 
MH: 
It’s four years; the first year is an internship, where you could – pretty much any 
internship, and then you do three years of just clinical anesthesia. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. And so, you’ve been at the U. since when? 
 
MH: 
Ninety-eight. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
MH: 
Well no, ’97, I started my internship. 
 
LG: 
Okay.  
 
MH: 
And then ’98, I did start my residency, and then I graduated in 2001 and have been 
faculty since then.  
 
LG: 
Okay. And can you describe your current position, you said you just moved into? 
 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 3 
 
MH: 
I’m the associate professor of clinical anesthesiology, and for the last year or so, I have 
been the anesthesiology Residency Director. 
 
LG: 
Okay; great, thank you. 
 
 
So, as we have talked previously, medicine is sort of stereotyped as a profession having 
an appreciation for the comic. Can you describe a little bit about when you first started 
noticing humor bubbling up in your training? 
 
MH: 
I think there’s been – since I’ve known we were going to be discussing this, I’ve been 
thinking about it over the last, you know, week or so. And I’ve actually come to the 
conclusion that I think there’s been several phases of humor (if you will) in my (at least 
that I’ve observed) in my medical career. 
 
[02:36] 
 
 
Initially, as an intern (and as a resident) in Scotland, where the circumstances were a lot 
harder: the hours are longer, they’re less supported – and also a different time as well 
(this was the late ‘80s). The humor was a lot more bitter, and kind of “gallows-ian” (if 
that’s a word?) –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
MH: 
And I think that was because it was tough, it was bitter, we were kind of almost lashing 
out a little bit at the circumstances, and medicine, and our supervisors, and our patients 
sometimes.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
I noticed as – and this may all be entirely me, and not the culture at all – but as 
circumstances get better, as people get a little more comfortable or happy in their careers, 
the humor mellows a little bit, perhaps it starts becoming a little more focused on you and 
on your circumstance, rather than on individual people. 
 
 
And so, yeah – to answer your question, I’d say day one. I mean, you know –  
 
LG: 
So, day one in medical school? 
 
MH: 
Day one in medical school; I mean, you know – and it’s not necessarily good, and it’s not 
necessarily stuff I’m proud of, or any of us are proud of, but it’s day one. I mean, when 
you enter the anatomy lab and you’re given your cadaver, someone who has honorably 
donated their body to medical science, and [scoffs] you give them a nickname [laughs], 
that is day one, you know? 
 
LG: 
That’s funny, because I have questions here about nicknaming the bodies [laughs]. 
 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 4 
 
 
Can you talk a little bit about those harsh circumstances of medical school and the 
training? (As it was when you went through it.) 
 
MH: 
So, and again, this is a different continent, and a different century (my god). But medical 
school I didn’t find too hard.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
MH: 
Medical school was just a lot of studying, and a lot of paying attention, and keeping my 
head down, and grinding through the work. Residency was really, for me (I think my wife 
would confirm this), was really where it got hard. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
When I did my residency, my first six months I averaged 120 hours a week, in the 
hospital. We were on call one in three, and what that meant is you stayed in-house every 
third night, and including the days on either side of it. And the same for the weekends: 
you’d go in on Saturday morning, and you’d come home on Monday night. And it was 
busy, you were working, you were not sleeping.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
[05:17] 
 
MH: 
And so, there’s the sleep deprivation stuff, there’s the – you’re anxious, and you’re 
scared, and you’re uncertain of yourself, you know, you’re an intern: you know, three 
weeks ago you were a med student, you know? And so, you’re trying to take the best care 
of patients that you can, with the limited skills and the limited knowledge; and in those 
days, unfortunately, limited support from the hierarchy.  
 
 
There really wasn’t a lot of teaching; it was kind of a see one, do one, kind of a 
philosophy, where, “You saw me do this the other day, you should be able to do this,” 
right? Never mind, you know, refining those skills. 
 
 
And I worked for the first six months on a vascular surgery ward. And in the west of 
Scotland, in the late ‘80s (in Glasgow, specifically), our patient population was drug 
addicts who have injected nasty stuff into vessels, and were losing arms or legs, or having 
strokes. They were the elderly who had smoked all their lives, and had horrible vascular 
disease, and were losing limbs and things. And then trauma patients who had, you know, 
had to be re-vascularized, and were potentially losing limbs. And then also poor, 
unfortunate souls, who were born with some weird medical disorder, so they were either 
clotting or not clotting, and that was playing havoc with their vascular system.  
 
 
So, for me (anyway) it was fairly disheartening. And taking care of these folks is 
technically challenging, because they’re hard to get IV access on, they’re hard to give 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 5 
 
medicines to, they’re hard to give fluids to. They’re often in transition, you know, 
because they’re withdrawing, you know, if they’re the drug addict population. 
 
 
And as a brand-new intern, again, you don’t have the skills, you don’t have those people 
skills yet to figure out how to handle that: either absolutely face-to-face, or emotionally. 
 
[07:15] 
 
LG: 
Did you feel overwhelmed? 
 
MH: 
Oh, absolutely; most of the time. 
 
LG: 
Can you describe that a little bit? 
 
MH: 
It was like – so, people often talk about when you feel overwhelmed like drowning, you 
know? Like trying to keep your head above water, you know, there’s a reason that’s a 
cliché [laughs]. But for me it wasn’t that (when I think back on it, anyway) – and 
remember this is, you know, 25-30 years ago, so you know. 
 
LG: 
My husband went through pulmonary critical care residency –  
 
MH: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
It was 120 hours a week. 
 
MH: 
Yeah, yeah. 
 
LG: 
It was the same –  
 
MH: 
Well what I meant with the timing was it’s – memory is destructive, right? 
 
LG: 
Oh, right; okay. 
 
MH: 
So, take all of this with a bit of salt; but for me, it felt like it was not drowning and 
keeping my head above water, it was actually running ahead of like an avalanche. Like I 
was sprinting as hard as I could and looking over my shoulder, and those rocks were just 
almost right there. And I know it’s probably the same thing, but for me, it’s different. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
Yeah, it was just, you know, you just kept going. And the problem is, what that does is, 
for me (again) is it turned me internally – I just kind of shut down everything, and just 
focused just on what I was doing right now, what I had to do next. And then self-
preservation, you know: eat when you can, sit when you can, sit down when you can, 
sleep when you can, all that (which is not good for a relationship). 
 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 6 
 
LG: 
No [laughs]. 
 
MH: 
Just in case you were wondering – again, probably you know as well. 
 
 
So, the humor was almost always internally generated as far as a coping mechanism or a 
– well this is a coping mechanism, but kind of lashing out at the hierarchy, or even 
patients, you know? That’s one of the problems with these situations is you start to resent 
patients –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
You know? Who are the reason we’re there, you know? That’s why we’re doing what 
we’re doing, is to take care of people; and yet, we end up resenting (at least personally, in 
this situation, in this time in my life) – you start resenting them because they’re the ones 
who are keeping you up all night. Because they’re the ones, how dare they have a heart 
attack, you know? I mean, it’s ridiculous when you think about it, right? I mean, it’s 
funny. 
 
LG: 
Well it’s a common response though, I think.  
 
MH: 
Oh, yeah. 
 
[09:38] 
 
LG: 
I had medical students tell me that they felt – this is sort of skipping to the second part of 
the interview, but they felt kind of almost futile, because even if a patient got better, you 
know, like you helped somebody – that one could be replaced by ten. 
 
MH: 
Yep. 
 
LG: 
And it’s just –  
 
MH: 
Right. 
 
LG: 
Exactly what you’re talking about. 
 
MH: 
Absolutely; and then, in my circumstance – and I’ve said this in previous discussions 
with people over the years – in my particular circumstance, it would be the same damn 
patient would come in three weeks later, right? Because these were the archetypes of that 
frustration: these were IV drug users –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
Who were not –  
 
LG: 
Unhealthy. 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 7 
 
 
MH: 
Who were unhealthy and were doing the same things over and over again. And you 
know, you roll the dice every time, eventually you’re going to get a snake-eyes, right? I 
mean, you keep doing it. And the smokers, you know, they would keep smoking, and 
they would clot off another part of their body, and they would come back in. And it 
wasn’t just a line of other people, it was a line of the same people, you know?  
 
 
And I’m sure there’s other people have other coping mechanisms, we’re talking about 
humor here. But you know, right now there is a – and this might be something, I don’t 
know if you’re on top of this or not – but there’s an epidemic of suicides in medicine 
right now. And I don’t know if [chuckles] – this is perhaps a very egotistical thing to say, 
but I don’t know if the idea of humor as a coping mechanism is a – if the people who 
couldn’t cope and ended up tragically ending their lives, if they didn’t have a coping 
mechanism, if they weren’t wired that way? 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. There was actually a documentary that was made in 2006-ish (or 2008, 
maybe) by the National Suicide Prevention –  
 
MH: 
Um-hmm? 
 
LG: 
And it was specifically about doctors. 
 
MH: 
Yep. 
 
LG: 
So, clearly, it’s just gotten worse? 
 
MH: 
Oh, yeah; we lose two medical school classes a year. 
 
LG: 
Whole medical school classes? 
 
MH: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
To suicide? 
 
MH: 
Yep; in this country. I mean, yeah – it’s 400 people or so. 
 
LG: 
So, do you think that – on this topic of the difficult nature of this work and this training – 
the duty of medicine (one of the duties) is to relieve suffering in people. Do you think 
that doctors, themselves, suffer? 
 
MH: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Because of their training, or because of the work conditions? 
 
[12:25] 
 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 8 
 
MH: 
I think that the answer is yes. I think the training (to some degree) has to be hard because 
the job is hard. But it should be hard in a productive way, right? I mean, if you’re training 
for a marathon, you go and you run lots of miles, because that’s what’s you’re going to 
do in the marathon. You don’t sit at home and hit your knees with a hammer –  
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
MH: 
Right? Now, it may feel like you’ve hit your knees with a hammer after you’ve finished a 
marathon but doing that is not good training; and yet, I think that is kind of what we have 
done in medicine (hopefully things are changing – it seems like things are changing). 
 
LG: 
Can you give me an example? 
 
MH: 
Of the changes? 
 
LG: 
No, of the hitting your knees? 
 
MH: 
Oh, well just the unsupported newbie thrown into the shark-filled tank, right? I mean, you 
know – and I again, I hope this, I think this has – it’s certainly changed in my program – 
but the idea that a brand new intern should be able to do all these: juggle a ward full of 
30-odd patients, make sure they all get their appropriate medications (because in those 
days we had to administer the antibiotic, for example). 
 
 
We had to put in the IVs, we had to put in the Foley catheters having seen maybe one or 
two, you know? Having done maybe three or four, without any support whatsoever, 
because that’s the job: you’ve got to be able to do stuff that you don’t necessarily feel – 
you know, sometimes you’ve got to push the boundaries a little bit: you’re creating a 
solution or developing a new technique or whatever.  
 
 
I don’t think that that is actually conducive to developing people who are able to cope 
with new challenges without getting terrified and running away. I mean, I think you help 
people and nurture people through – you don’t just go, you know, we don’t kick kids out 
of the house when they’re 12, right? You kick them out when they’re 18; and you know, 
that six years is where you kind of hopefully guide them along with the idea of flying on 
their own. 
 
[14:47] 
 
 
But also, the whole work hour thing, you know? Working 120 hours a week is not 
conducive – because you’re not going to do that, you know? Nowadays, I can only speak 
for my residency – our residents average about 65 hours a week over the course of their 
residency. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
Our faculty averages about 62 hours a week. 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 9 
 
 
LG: 
So, it’s half? 
 
MH: 
Half of what I trained –  
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
MH: 
Half of what I did. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
MH: 
But my point is that what our residents are doing is actually what they’re going to do 
when they’re done –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
Right? Because our faculty work about the same. Now, this is a little different, because 
we have more control over our schedules just because of the way it works. So, there is a 
little bit of a difference there; but you know, the actual hours themselves aren’t that 
different. So, I feel we’re training you for the real world. 
 
LG: 
What you’re actually going to be doing down the road? 
 
MH: 
Yes, yeah. Whereas, 120 hours a week is – nobody works 120, I mean maybe some of the 
ICU guys in little places, where they’re the only doc for, you know, there’s two people in 
a practice and they just trade off: maybe. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
MH: 
They tend to be lower acuity, and it’s not such a big deal. But you know, a big, busy, 
tertiary referral center, you can’t work 120 hours a week. And nobody does; so, why 
would they think that was a vital, useful part of training? 
 
 
Actually, I am reading a book right now (which you might be interested in, actually) 
called Let Me Heal, by a guy named Ken Ludmerer – I think he’s an internist, but he’s 
also a kind of medical historian. But he talks, this book is about graduate medical 
education in the United States, comes from the very first residency, it jumps all the way 
up to where we are today. 
 
 
I’m only about half way through it, but what’s interesting to me is that in those first 
residencies (which were modeled, actually, on the German system; the Germans were 
doing it before we were) – they were very clear, and aggressively clear that residents had 
to be limited as to how many patients they were taking care of at any one time, because it 
adversely affected their education if they had more than (I can’t remember what the 
number was in any specialty), but more than 12 patients.  
 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 10 
 
 
They couldn’t possibly learn enough about those individual patients to take good care of 
them. So, they were capped, they were limited; this is the beginning of the 20th century. 
 
[17:01] 
 
 
So, we’re now doing the same thing in internal medicine, and some of the primary care 
professions here, for residents –  
 
LG: 
[??] 
 
MH: 
And people are all up in arms about, “Oh, no! This is not how I trained.” And I’m like, 
“No, go back 100 years; that’s exactly how this system was envisioned.” 
 
LG: 
Was supposed to be doing; um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
It’s how it was envisioned; the people that created this system envisioned it this way. And 
that’s really – that might be an interesting book –  
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
MH: 
It’s a little dry; it’s a little dry, but it’s very interesting. 
 
LG: 
It would be good for me to get a history of how, like how medical education has evolved 
–  
 
MH: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
You know – 
 
MH: 
And it’s graduate medical education – he doesn’t really talk about med school –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
MH: 
He talks – it’s residencies and internships, and fellowships and those kind of things. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm, um-hmmm. 
 
 
So, do you think – does the humor, if it starts day one in an anatomy lab, does it lessen 
once you get out of training, once you get out of residency or fellowship? I mean, in your 
experience as [??] 
 
MH: 
No, I think it changes. 
 
LG: 
In what way? 
 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 11 
 
MH: 
I think it changes. So, you know, I do – I think that when you’re a med student, when 
you’re an intern (and at any time during your training) – and it’s human nature, right: 
when you’re scared, when you’re frustrated, the humor becomes more of a defense 
mechanism. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
It becomes more of a, either a way to keep things away or (to some degree) make them 
less scary. I think as you become more comfortable, as you move through your career, the 
humor becomes more of a, kind of a way of discussing the situation we’re in, a way of 
kind of (for me, anyway) a way of talking about the differences between specialties, 
between approaches, the kind of making light (a little bit) of some of the sadder parts of 
our job – not as a defense mechanism, but as a kind of a sharing of community, you 
know, that we get this joke. 
 
LB: 
Can you give an example? 
 
[19:05] 
 
MH: 
[Laughs] So, yeah – I can give you two. So, there’s a joke about a bunch of doctors going 
duck hunting. (You’ve probably heard all these jokes.) And so, there’s a pathologist, a 
psychiatrist, an internal medicine doc, and a surgeon go duck hunting. And there’s a 
bunch of birds fly over their hide, and one of them says, “Oh, look, look! Ducks.”  
 
 
And the internal medicine doctor says, “Well you know, they might not be ducks; there’s 
a huge differential: they could be pigeons, they could be you know, cormorants. Who 
knows what they could be, we really do need to exclude all the other possibilities before 
we really, definitively say they’re ducks.” 
 
 
The psychiatrist says, “Well, you know, it doesn’t really matter whether they are ducks or 
not; the important thing is whether they really realize that they are ducks. If they’re at one 
with their duck-ness, then they truly are ducks; and if they’re not, then they’re not.” 
 
 
The surgeon just loads up and just blasts the shit out of them all. 
 
LG: 
[Laughing] 
 
MH: 
And as they all fall to the ground, he turns to the pathologist and says, “Go find me a 
duck.” 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
MH: 
So, that’s kind of an example of a kind of a gentle ribbing of our colleagues, as far as the 
stereotypes of those professions. And I don’t think any of it’s mean; I’ve told that joke 
and everybody laughs. I think it’s kind of – it’s true, you know: internal medicine doctors 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 12 
 
are famous for coming up with a huge list of differentials, and they’re happy to just sit 
and talk about for hours, you know? And it’s part of their job. 
 
 
So, then the other one I would say was – and this is a little harsher (as an example). Let 
me see if I don’t get this straight.  
 
 
The oncologist who goes to their patient’s grave for one more round of chemotherapy, 
and the patient’s not there (the corpse is not there), and there’s a note from nephrology 
saying, “Gone to dialysis.” 
 
LG: 
Yeah [laughs]. 
 
MH: 
Yeah, so your husband probably –  
 
LG: 
Yeah, he told me that one. 
 
MH: 
Has heard that, yeah. 
 
LG: 
The oncology ones are harsh [laughs]. 
 
MH: 
Yeah, yeah. So, that’s a little harsher, that’s a little, you know, I mean, because that’s 
speaking – I detect an undercurrent there of not gentle ribbing, but of like, “God, you 
guys never know when to quit.” 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
Like, “What are you doing?” Right? 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
And you can see how that might come from a frustration, maybe someone has taken care 
of somebody who like, you know, in a palliative sense, really just should be: have the 
conversation and just let go, right? You’re done, you know? Let’s go out with dignity, 
let’s go out with comfort.  
 
[21:50] 
 
 
But the little bit of a dig, little bit of a poke at the oncologist or the nephrologist to just 
back off. 
 
LG: 
[??] one more thing. 
 
MH: 
Yeah, exactly. So, you can see – and my point was that those are – one is kind of a gentle 
ribbing, a friendly ribbing; and then the other is more of a –  
 
LG: 
A little harsher. 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 13 
 
 
MH: 
A little bit harsher; like, that joke is making a point (or trying to make a point). 
 
LG: 
Well that’s a nice segue into one of my questions is, can you talk a little bit about 
attitudes towards death in medicine? 
 
MH: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
Again, this is a profession that (ideally) staves off death (in the best cases); but oftentimes 
that’s not possible. And so, how does that affect physician attitudes towards death? Or at 
least maybe you can’t speak for all physicians –  
 
MH: 
Sure. 
 
LG: 
But at least for yourself? 
 
MH: 
I think this is a hugely complicated area, as you can imagine; because it gets into spiritual 
beliefs, it gets into, you know, your upbringing, it gets into specialties –  
 
LG: 
Um-hm. 
 
MH: 
It gets into, you know, personal histories with death and sickness.  
 
 
For me, one of the – I always joke with patients, “My job is to put you to sleep, keep you 
alive, and wake you up again.” And so, for me – my job is to keep people alive.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
MH: 
And so, if someone dies in (or around) my gravitational pull, I feel a little [pause] sad 
(obviously), but like, disappointed in myself.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
MH: 
Because if I’m seeing someone, it is because there is hope, and there is a plan, and there 
is a way out, and there is a cure potential (or at least a staving off) of death. And if 
someone dies, then we have failed in our intent.  
 
 
Now, I think that’s different if you’re a palliative care doc –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
Right? This person is going to die, and my job is to make that comfortable and dignified, 
and all that kind of thing. So, they’re going to have a different attitude –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 14 
 
MH: 
Right? If you talk about a primary care physician, you know? A family practitioner who 
someone dies on, by god, that’s a spectacular catastrophe, because that’s not –  
 
[24:23] 
 
 
So, I’m closer to death than perhaps the primary care doc. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
But my job is still to stave it off; whereas a palliative care person is right in there, 
wallowing in it, right? 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
They live in that. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
MH: 
That’s how they do. And so, I think – my point is, I think the specialties dramatically 
change one’s attitude to this. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. I did have a doctor once tell me that he felt like death was sort of an enemy, or 
like something that you’re constantly battling, and that – something like he felt like a 
failure, you know, if a patient died. I mean, he knew (consciously) –  
 
[25:08] 
 
MH: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
That you can’t save everybody –  
 
MH: 
Sure. 
 
LG: 
And people have terrible health; but there was still that kind of nagging –  
 
MH: 
Sure. 
 
LG: 
Sense, you know? Which I think makes medicine – you know, then again, obviously your 
point about the specialties is important; but people die, I mean, that’s the biological –  
 
MH: 
Right. 
 
LG: 
Process. 
 
MH: 
We’re all going to die. 
 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 15 
 
LG: 
But then you’re in this job where it’s your duty to –  
 
MH: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Arrest that, and so –  
 
MH: 
Right. 
 
LG: 
So, there’s kind of a contradiction –  
 
MH: 
Sure. 
 
LG: 
Built into the –  
 
MH: 
Absolutely. 
 
LG: 
Profession, right? 
 
MH: 
Absolutely; and I think that comes down to a sense of – and I am not a fatalist, and I am 
not a religious person – but I do think this phrase has utility, which is “It’s not your 
time.” 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
And I think that it’s when it’s not their time that it’s a problem. You know, I’ve only ever 
had one person die on me in the OR. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
MH: 
And that was a lady who was having a liver transplant, and she was sick as snot. And we 
fought that for 16 hours, and eventually she died. It was her time; we were tilting at 
windmills –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
But we had to give it a go. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
Because this was her only chance; and it didn’t work. It didn’t happen. 
 
 
So, I felt bad (of course) because someone died, but I didn’t feel like disappointed in 
ourselves – I think we did everything we could have, I don’t think anyone could have 
done better. We gave her the best shot she had. So, I don’t feel bad about that particular 
aspect of it. But it’s when it wasn’t your time, is when there’s a problem, I think. 
 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 16 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. That you feel like it affects you? 
 
MH: 
Yeah, yeah. 
 
LG: 
Mentally. 
 
MH: 
Yeah, absolutely. 
 
LG: 
Or psychologically. 
 
MH: 
And it’s funny, one of the phrases we use in anesthesia (and again, this may be different) 
is we talk about the patient trying to die –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
MH: 
Like they’re volitional –  
 
LG: 
Uh-huh? 
 
MH: 
And just from the perspective of humor, you know, it’s kind of a funny thing to say, 
right, of course? 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
And we say it deliberately, right? We know no one is actually trying to die, right? Even – 
well, we don’t take care of suicides, but you know, people aren’t trying to die; but it’s 
just kind of a funny way to think about it, especially for those of us (perhaps) who aren’t 
religious, and don’t think of a heaven or a hell, or a god or a devil, or whatever, trying to 
take them, or death trying to take them, you know? 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
[27:28] 
 
MH: 
It’s just something is driving this, and it’s funny to think of it as the patient. 
 
LG: 
Well, and there’s lots of – I mean, death itself in American culture is a pretty taboo topic 
–  
 
MH: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Particularly in the States –  
 
MH: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
People don’t talk about dying. 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 17 
 
 
MH: 
Yeah. Well they talk about passing on – that always frustrates me, when people talk 
about passing on, or so and so passed. 
 
LG: 
Yeah, yeah. 
 
MH: 
Yeah, he died.  
 
LG: 
But it also seems like there – in medical humor there’s lots of kind of slang terms for 
death, and ways to talk about –  
 
MH: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
People having died, and things like that. 
 
MH: 
Or almost dying. 
 
LG: 
Or almost –  
 
MH: 
You’ve probably heard a bunch of these from your husband, you know: circling the drain 
–  
 
LG: 
Yes, exactly. 
 
MH: 
All that kind of thing, yeah. 
 
LG: 
So, do you think there’s a relationship between those forms of humor, and the nature of 
the work? You know, this attempt to stave off death is kind of a Herculean task, you 
know [laughs] – or sometimes tilting at windmills –  
 
MH: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
And this humor that has all these, you know, either slang terms for death, or dying 
patients –  
 
MH: 
Well, yeah – I think so; because it’s the world we move in, right? It’s – yeah, I mean, if 
you talked to a bunch of electricians, I’m sure they’ve got a bunch of slang terms for 
wire, right? I mean, it’s our job; it’s what we deal with, it’s our lingua franca. We’re 
going to have terms and stories and little weird euphemisms for death and dying and 
illness. I mean – yeah, that would be a fascinating book as well: all the weird little 
phrases and things that people talk about, you know? 
 
LG: 
Can you think of a couple of examples? 
 
MH: 
Oh, god – I knew you were going to ask that. 
 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 18 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] I know a bunch of ones from Britain. 
 
MH: 
Like what? Can you give me an example? [Laughs] 
 
LG: 
Too many birthdays –  
 
MH: 
[Laughs] 
 
LG: 
Is one. The problem is – I think it’s TMB –  
 
MH: 
Yeah, yeah. 
 
LG: 
Is the official term for it? 
 
MH: 
Yeah, yeah. 
 
LG: 
Or a good for parts only –  
 
MH: 
Yeah, yeah. 
 
LG: 
Is, I think, another one –  
 
MH: 
Well yeah, there’s a lot – yeah, I see what you mean. So, one of the ones is you know, 
don’t start any long books. 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] I remember that one. 
 
[29:39] 
 
MH: 
Yeah; and then we [laughs] – this goes to the gallows humor thing in the ER (you know, 
when I worked for the ER back home) there was a competition going on the night shift 
about the least appropriate way to tell someone they were going to die. 
 
LG: 
Oh, god [laughs]. 
 
MH: 
Or to tell a relative that their relative is, you know – was, you know, “I’ve got good news 
and bad news. The good news is you don’t have to buy him a Christmas present this 
year.” 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
MH: 
“The bad news is you’re not going to get one from him.” 
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
Which is –  
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 19 
 
 
LG: 
So bad. 
 
MH: 
Horrible. 
 
LG: 
Well you would never actually do it. 
 
MH: 
Of course not, no, no. 
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
There was actually a New Yorker cartoon (and I think I have it in my office, but I don’t 
dare put it on my wall). And it’s a guy coming out, it’s a guy coming out of the surgery, 
and into the waiting room, and he’s taking off his scrub cap. And he says, “Ah, the lovely 
widow!” 
 
[Laughter] 
 
LG: 
Oh, god; that’s awful. 
 
MH: 
Which is, again, horrible –  
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
MH: 
But –  
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
MH: 
I don’t know why its funny, yeah. 
 
 
The other thing I was going to say (and this goes to specialty-specific stuff) is one of the 
things that people are often – you know, in anesthesiology, people are scared, because 
they’re going to be completely out of control of themselves and their bodily functions; 
they’re potentially having something fairly significant. As my chairman always says, you 
know, “You’re going to have your anatomy and physiology irrevocably altered today.”  
 
 
Even if it’s relatively minor surgery: having a gall bladder, having an appendix taken out 
– it’s relatively minor surgery, and you’ll be fine as long as you’re not a sick person, 
chances are you’ll do just fine. But it’s scary to people –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
For all those reasons. And so, one of our jobs, as anesthesia, who has never met you 
before, right? We met you five minutes ago; you know, we’ve never come to clinic, 
we’ve never seen you over, you know, years of care. We don’t know you from Adam, 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 20 
 
you don’t know us. We are now going to be the ones holding your precious life in our 
hands for the next however many hours. 
 
[31:40] 
 
 
And so, part of our job is to engender a trust, and develop a relationship real quick, so 
that you are happy – either with us taking care of you or your loved one. 
 
 
And so, the idea of this whole death thing is forward in people’s minds. And so, we need 
to, in some way, either acknowledge and discuss that (if they’re having serious surgery) – 
I do neuro-anesthesia, I do surgery for people with brain tumors, so that is foremost on 
people’s minds. And you know, they have a fairly significant morbidity and mortality.  
 
 
So, we have to acknowledge and deal with that in an open, sincere way. Or if they’re just 
having an appendix, like, it’s nothing, you know? And statistically they had a higher 
chance of dying on the roads on the way to the hospital, like, legitimately. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
If you look at the statistics of them on the table.  
 
 
So, we discuss death a lot: with patients, with people who are scared of dying today. And 
so, there has to be – we have to be comfortable swimming in that world, and having those 
discussions: either in a legitimate, “Yeah, sorry mate; you’ve got a brain tumor, and you 
could die today. But I’m going to do my damnedest to make sure that does not happen.” 
Right? 
 
 
Or contrarily, “You’re not going to die, shut-up; what are you talking about? You’re fine” 
Right? “This is nothing.” Right? “This is an expensive haircut.” 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
MH: 
Right? So, you have to be able to acknowledge which of those chairs you’re sitting in and 
be okay with those two chairs. And I think humor can play, not so much in the serious 
chair, but in the other chair –  
 
 
You know, one of my favorite lines, which actually really seems to work, when we’re 
leaving the waiting room (taking the patient from their room to the OR), the relatives will 
often say, “Good luck!” And I started this a few years ago, and it seems to work with a 
lot of people: I often say, “They don’t need luck, they’ve got me.” 
 
LG: 
Nice. 
 
[33:45] 
 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 21 
 
MH: 
And people like that; it’s kind of funny, it’s kind of jokey, it’s kind of pseudo-egotistical, 
you know, like – you know? 
 
LG: 
But it inspires faith in them? 
 
MH: 
I think so –  
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
MH: 
It seems to. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
MH: 
And it’s kind of jokey –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
It’s kind of humorous; you know, I’m – you know. 
 
 
So, I think that there’s a role for it in that, as well: in that approach too. 
 
LG: 
In other words, easing people’s fears? 
 
MH: 
Yes. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
Yes. Because you’ve got to – and I say this to my residents a lot – there’s a fine line 
between, well, it’s subtle and nuanced to be able to say to someone, “Pshh, you’re going 
to be fine; this is nothing.” Without it sounding like you don’t know or care. Right? 
You’ve got to be able to impart this, “I am this baddest ass in this hospital, and I will take 
care of you.” And, “But you don’t really need me, this is easy; don’t worry about it.” 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. Well you want them to think you’re taking it seriously. 
 
MH: 
Yes, yes. 
 
LG: 
Even if it’s small. 
 
MH: 
But also, perhaps, you are taking it seriously, but you’re not taking –  
 
LG: 
You’re not worried about it. 
 
MH: 
You’re not a [??] 
 
LG: 
You’re not worried about it. 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 22 
 
 
MH: 
No. But you’ve got to have both of that, you know? And sometimes humor is a way of 
doing that. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
Because if you just, “Pshh.” You know, just kind of wave it off, then it can come over as, 
“Oh, he doesn’t know how serious this is. Oh my god, does this guy know what he’s 
talking about?” 
 
 
You know, as opposed to what you’re going for, which is, “Oh, I know exactly what I’m 
talking about, and you’re going to be fine; this is nothing.” 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm; easing people’s fears.  
 
MH: 
Yeah.  
 
LG: 
So, do you think that idea, maybe, easing fears is why doctors might use humor through 
their training? Is it a way of easing fear –  
 
MH: 
Easing their own fears, sometimes –  
 
LG: 
Yeah? 
 
MH: 
Yeah, absolutely, yeah. 
 
LG: 
Yeah, so all that joking through the residency and the training? 
 
MH: 
Absolutely; yeah, no question about it. Of lessening this other thing, this imposing, scary 
thing – whether it’s death, or an obnoxious patient, or a jerk surgeon, or whatever it is – 
when you joke about it –  
 
[35:52] 
 
 
You know, the other thing that’s interesting, and I don’t know if you know Ricky Gervais 
–  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
The comedian, the British comedian – he wrote “The Office.” 
 
LG: 
Oh, okay. 
 
MH: 
And he did standup, and he really – he doesn’t have a lot of boundaries. But he makes the 
point (and I think it’s a good point, whether or not you appreciate his humor): that there is 
a difference between the point of a joke and the target of a joke.  
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 23 
 
 
 
So, his example (and it’s a little – ) he says you can make a joke about rape as long as the 
target is not the victim. Right? Rape, as a subject is – he says – 
 
LG: 
Taboo. 
 
MH: 
He says there is nothing that should be taboo – nothing should be taboo. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
Right? No subject should be taboo; people can be taboo. You don’t want to make fun of a 
handicapped person, you don’t want to make fun of a rape victim. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
You can make fun of –  
 
LG: 
Rape. 
 
MH: 
Rape, you can certainly make fun of rapists –  
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
MH: 
But you can’t make fun of the person – so, he differentiated –  
 
LG: 
So, the victim shouldn’t be the target of the joke, is what you’re saying? 
 
MH: 
Right, so that’s the [??]. The point of the joke is one thing, the target is another. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
So, I’m trying to think of an example, because I did it the other day, and my wife got all 
upset at me until we had this discussion (and I can’t remember what it was now; doesn’t 
matter). 
 
LG: 
Well that’s funny, because we actually covered rape jokes in a class I taught in the spring 
–  
 
MH: 
Um-hmm? 
 
LG: 
They were like fraternity jokes and things like that. 
 
MH: 
Yeah, yeah. 
 
LG: 
But my students were absolutely – it was a hard thing to teach –  
 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 24 
 
MH: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Because the topic was so shocking. 
 
MH: 
Right. 
 
LG: 
They had a hard time getting passed the topic and talking about like the way the jokes 
functioned –  
 
MH: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Which was more of my interest, what I was trying to get them to do. 
 
MH: 
Right; no, no – I think that’s fascinating, because there is a huge difference.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
And it’s an important difference. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
Because that’s (like I was just saying) the demeaning, the diminishing of something –  
 
LG: 
Right. 
 
MH: 
Right? You don’t want to diminish the victim: you don’t ever want to do that; you want 
to diminish the concept, or the stupid idea, or the person who is perpetrating the badness. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm, um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
That’s your target; not the –  
 
LG: 
Well I think your point about like, even if there’s a joke about the patient, right, that 
would be sort of a taboo target, or something –  
 
MH: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Like that, a victim, or whatever. The point isn’t usually (in my understanding) the patient 
–  
 
MH: 
Right. 
 
[38:15] 
 
LG: 
It’s sort of the situation –  
 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 25 
 
MH: 
Well my example of the patient who died and is absent from their tomb –  
 
LG: 
Right. 
 
MH: 
Right? 
 
LG: 
Yeah [laughs]. 
 
MH: 
I’m not making fun of the guy that died –  
 
LG: 
No. 
 
MH: 
That’s not a joke about the poor person who had cancer and died. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
MH: 
It’s actually – and it’s not even really a joke about the oncologist or the nephrologist – 
it’s a joke about our system –  
 
LG: 
System. 
 
MH: 
It’s a joke about the dysfunctional system that somehow values treatment over care. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. And do you think that feeds into this distress among doctors? 
 
MH: 
Oh, absolutely –  
 
LG: 
The treatment over care? Can you talk a little about that? 
 
MH: 
Yeah, there’s a huge – I don’t know how, are you on Twitter? 
 
LG: 
Sort of, not really. 
 
MH: 
So, you might want to – as part of this process, you might want to dive into there a little 
bit (and we can talk more about that later), but I can give you my Twitter information. 
 
 
There’s a huge conversation going on in Twitter right now about wellness and resiliency 
in medicine: all tied in with burnout and suicides, and all that stuff; big conversation 
going on right now. And what comes up over and over and over again is this sense of 
futility and frustration and, “Let me take care of my damn patients and not fill out the 
stupid forms.”  
 
 
And, “Why I have spent 20 minutes on a phone call to an insurance company who is 
going to deny this poor lady this drug that she desperately needs?” You know, and it’s a 
decision being made by an administrator, an MBA – not a physician or even a nurse, or 
any kind of healthcare professional. And it’s those stories, over and over and over again.  
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 26 
 
 
 
And I really do think that that’s what’s driving the crisis, the burnout crisis in medicine 
right now: is all of this stupid shit we’re having to do. And it’s not just in this country 
either; I’ve got (obviously) I’ve got friends from medical school who are still practicing 
in the UK –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
[40:16] 
 
MH: 
Exactly the same there. 
 
LG: 
Well one of the interesting things I’ve found, you know, as I’ve moved along in this 
project is that the humor, actually, among different countries is quite similar.  
 
MH: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
You know, it’s (obviously) and there’s published examples, you know, from Britain, but 
also Turkey –  
 
MH: 
Um-hmm? 
 
LG: 
And Japan. 
 
MH: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
And so, it’s clearly not necessarily culture-specific to a country –  
 
MH: 
Right. 
 
LG: 
I think it’s occupational –  
 
MH: 
It’s culturally specific to medicine. 
 
LG: 
To medicine, exactly. 
 
MH: 
Yeah; it’s the medical culture, not the geographic culture. 
 
LG: 
Exactly. 
 
MH: 
Yeah, yeah. 
 
LG: 
Exactly. And I think, you know, this idea of kind of the absurdity, in some ways –  
 
MH: 
Yeah. 
 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 27 
 
LG: 
Of the modern healthcare system, and this sort of pervasive (not all the time, but you 
know, a pervasive) cultural dimension of suffering –  
 
MH: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
Is a lot of what’s driving – I think it was underlying some of the humor –  
 
MH: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
You know? 
 
MH: 
Oh yeah, no – and it’s –  
 
LG: 
But doctors don’t often, you know, you can read about burnout, but nobody says doctors 
suffer. 
 
MH: 
Right. 
 
LG: 
You know, they frame it in different ways –  
 
MH: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
In literature; it’s framed as burnout, or maybe depression –  
 
MH: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
But I really think, you know, patients suffer because they’re ill, healthcare providers are 
sort of tasked with relieving suffering, and the piece that’s missing, that people don’t 
acknowledge, is that the system causes suffering to the healthcare providers.  
 
MH: 
Absolutely. 
 
LG: 
You know? 
 
MH: 
And the other piece of that is that it’s very hard for us, and nurses, and PAs, and all of the 
healthcare professions, you know (clinically, you know) involved. It’s very hard for us to 
complain. 
 
LG: 
Right. 
 
MH: 
Right? I did a liver transplant on Monday night with this lady who, right now (I’m sure), 
three days later is lying in the ICU in some considerable pain – but she’s got a new liver, 
but she’s in pain. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 28 
 
MH: 
Right? It’s hard for me to complain about whatever I [??] the system, right? 
 
LG: 
[Inaudible] 
 
MH: 
When I’m taking care of people with cancer, and trauma, and you know, they’ve lost a 
baby, and all these other things – how can you? 
 
LG: 
You can’t say, “I have a cold,” if you don’t feel good today. 
 
MH: 
Yeah, or even just, “Oh, I had to type for 20 minutes on my computer.” 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
Right? Now, I’m not diminishing that person who wrote that Tweet’s point, right? 
Because that is grinding, that is soul-destroying –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
But it’s very hard to complain about that in a public forum, when you, you know, are 
taking care of people who have these spectacularly awful situations. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm, um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
That we always consider it, “Well it’s not that bad.” 
 
LG: 
Well what happens is it gets ignored, and –  
 
MH: 
Of course.  
 
[43:02] 
 
LG: 
And pushed down –  
 
MH: 
Yep. 
 
LG: 
And compounds. 
 
MH: 
Absolutely. 
 
LG: 
You know? 
 
MH: 
Absolutely; no, absolutely, yeah. 
 
LG: 
And I think it creates this kind of – I think there’s a culture of suffering –  
 
MH: 
Yep. 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 29 
 
 
LG: 
In the practice of medicine, that includes doctors, you know. 
 
MH: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
That’s a sort of a context for a lot of that humor. 
 
MH: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
That’s sort of the idea that I’m working toward. Because what else are you going to do, 
except laugh? 
 
MH: 
Right. 
 
LG: 
You know? [Laughs] 
 
MH: 
Right, or –  
 
LG: 
Commit suicide. 
 
MH: 
Commit suicide, right? See, that’s a perfect example of where we are not making fun of 
the people committing suicide, we’re making fun of the concept that – 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
MH: 
That’s the alternative, yes. I completely agree; I was going to say the same thing [laughs]. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
MH: 
Yeah – do you want to sit up here? You seem to be getting blinded? 
 
LG: 
Well I’m okay, maybe I’ll just move right here.  
 
MH: 
We can, or I can –  
 
LG: 
I don’t want to put this too close, because I get feedback if I get –  
 
MH: 
Oh, right. 
 
LG: 
Too much, get too close to the microphone. 
 
MH: 
Come around here, there’s a seat right there.  
 
LG: 
Can you remember any examples from gross anatomy? 
 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 30 
 
MH: 
You know, I did anatomy for like two years, I’m surprised I can’t. So, yeah – the worst 
one, and the one that I kind of started this conversation with was (and this is shameful) – 
We were given our cadaver (as I said at the beginning), someone who had selflessly and 
honorably donated their body to medical science, and it was a male, and it was an older 
gentleman who had a tiny, tiny penis. And so, we nicknamed our cadaver Justin. 
 
LG: 
Justin. [Laughs] That’s a pretty good one. One of the medical students told me theirs had 
congestive heart failure, which resulted in a very large penis, and they named him after a 
porn star, so –  
 
MH: 
Yeah, yeah. 
 
LG: 
[Laughter] [??] 
 
MH: 
Yeah, and I’m ashamed of that. I mean, really – that was completely disrespectful; that 
was horribly disrespectful to someone who had selflessly done something just to help us.  
 
LG: 
But the idea of naming (or nicknaming) the body – that’s very common; I mean, it seems 
like –  
 
MH: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
A lot (most), maybe most –  
 
MH: 
Yeah, yeah. I can’t think of anybody else in our class; I’m sure they all did, but that’s the 
one that –  
 
LG: 
Stuck in your mind. 
 
MH: 
Stuck in my mind – it was ours [laughs]. 
 
LG: 
So, can you talk about – I mean, is gross anatomy traumatizing when you first walk in? 
Like, why would you name the body? Is it because that’s where you face death for the 
first time, right? 
 
MH: 
Yeah, yeah absolutely. 
 
LG: 
Every day. 
 
[45:43] 
 
MH: 
And the interesting thing is (and I don’t know if they still do this), but there were pale 
blue plastic bags over the cadaver’s heads. And my understanding was that they did that 
to (in some degree) dehumanize the cadaver –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 31 
 
 
MH: 
So that we could do what we now had to do, which was chop them up in various ways: 
highly prescribed ways.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
MH: 
But we, you know, had to chop –  
 
LG: 
You had to take them apart. 
 
MH: 
Well and it took like a year and a half; I mean, I did like a year and a half of anatomy.  
 
LG: 
But naming kind of re-humanizes the body? 
 
MH: 
It does, yeah. 
 
LG: 
You know, even if it’s a funny name, or –  
 
MH: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
I mean, you’re sort of acknowledging that this is not just a lab specimen, this was a 
person. 
 
MH: 
Right. And so, there’s the part of us that may well have been responding as, you know, 
we were all like 19, 20 years old –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
You know, responding to the authoritarianism of, you know, the university that thought 
they knew better, you know, we were responding to that in a typical teenage way. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
Or there’s a component of that which is – this was our first real – this was the first class 
we took, you know? And so, we were all, you know, gung ho with these ideas of, you 
know, medicine and being hard and cold, and “We’re tough.” 
 
 
So, the idea of being kind of demeaning to this ex-person appealed, perhaps. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
You know, that we were like showing – it was kind of a really bad show kind of thing, 
you know? 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 32 
 
MH: 
Just, you know? 
 
LG: 
But people still do it, you know? 
 
MH: 
Yeah; well I think nowadays they’re moving more to prosections, where you get bits: you 
get a leg, you get an arm –  
 
LG: 
Oh, really? I didn’t realize that. 
 
MH: 
Yeah, because what they can do is they can – what they often do is they have expert 
anatomists dissect the arm; so, then you’re given this beautiful, perfect specimen, but you 
don’t have to do the dissection yourself (but you can see all the nerves, and the veins, and 
the arteries, and so on as [??]). 
 
LG: 
But it comes pre-dissected? 
 
MH: 
But it comes beautifully pre-dissected. 
 
LG: 
Huh; interesting. 
 
MH: 
So, the few reasons they do that: one, they don’t need as many specimens –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
Like, because we had 200 people in my class, four or five people in a group – so, you 
know, that’s a lot of –  
 
LG: 
That’s a lot of people – bodies. 
 
MH: 
Cadavers you needed; whereas, if you can just have a few prosections that are well-
preserved, and you can use them over, and over, and over again. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm, um-hmm; interesting. 
 
[48:27] 
 
MH: 
And so, it’s a little more efficient from the anatomy lab perspective.  
 
LG: 
Did anyone ever play any practical jokes in the gross anatomy? 
 
MH: 
We never had that, no. I’ve heard stories, of course, from other schools. Actually, there 
was a story from my school that (I don’t know if it’s true or not), because there’s always 
these –  
 
LG: 
It’s folklore. 
 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 33 
 
MH: 
Urban legends – folklore [laughs], right –  
 
LG: 
[Laughing] 
 
MH: 
Exactly. That someone had chopped the tips of the fingers off of their cadaver –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
MH: 
And gone to one of the buildings on campus that had an elevator. And as they were 
getting, while they waited until the doors were closing, and then said, “Hold on, hold on,” 
and then just as the doors were closing, they threw in the tips that they had –  
 
LG: 
The fingers, yeah. 
 
MH: 
And screamed, as the doors closed, into the elevator, with people in it. 
 
LG: 
[Laughing] 
 
MH: 
And the story goes that –  
 
LG: 
That, I’m sure, is not true. 
 
MH: 
This was complained about and he ended up getting expelled. 
 
LG: 
Expelled, yeah. 
 
MH: 
Which would be perfectly appropriate, but I don’t know how true the story is. 
 
LG: 
[Laughing] It makes a good story though. 
 
MH: 
It does, it does; and there’s a ton of these, right? And this is another aspect of the humor 
thing, it’s a funny story in a way that practical jokes are funny, right? But you don’t know 
how true it is, but has it served the purpose of warning to students, “That got us expelled, 
don’t do that.” 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
Even if it’s not true. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
It’s a funny story if it’s not true, and it serves as a warning, you know? 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
I don’t know. 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 34 
 
 
LG: 
Well again, if gross anatomy is the first class that medical students take, they take it their 
first year –  
 
MH: 
Well it was in Glasgow – I don’t know; I don’t think they necessarily do that. I know that 
at the U, they have a kind of integrated curriculum, the way you do kind of bits of pieces 
of everything the entire time. 
 
LG: 
Oh, so you do your clinical and your classes at the same time? 
 
MH: 
Yeah, they kind of switch –  
 
LG: 
I see. 
 
MH: 
For various reasons. 
 
LG: 
But that’s a class you know, where getting back to that topic of death: you literally stare 
death in the face every time you go in there; you’re taking a person apart. I think the 
humor does tend – I’ve heard from lots of people that humor tends to start because you 
know, you either nickname it, or you find funny things in people’s bodies, you know, that 
you might make jokes about (like, you know, breast implant), you know –  
 
MH: 
Yeah, sure. 
 
LG: 
Any kind of thing that you find – 
 
MH: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
In a person’s body, or just weird pathologies. 
 
MH: 
Yep. 
 
[50:53] 
 
LG: 
And then as you move through your training, you’re no longer responsible for a lab 
specimen, but you’re responsible for a human being, right? 
 
MH: 
Right. 
 
LG: 
So there’s just that specter of like sort of death, that kind of [laughs] you know – 
 
MH: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
You know people –  
 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 35 
 
MH: 
Right, so yeah – it’s definitely, I mean the whole (it’s such a cliché though), but you 
know, the humor is definitely a way of coping with those things that most people don’t 
confront very often and we confront all the time.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
Death, significant responsibility, and significant consequences if you screw up. 
 
LG: 
Right, death being the worst. 
 
MH: 
Right. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
MH: 
So, it’s a way of making light, and perhaps coping with those possibilities; I mean, yeah – 
I’m not a psychologist, but it seems pretty –  
 
LG: 
Yeah, yeah. Other specialties that have that kind of stress – I mean, not specialties, other 
professions that have that kind of stress – maybe not quite the responsibility, but that – 
have similar kinds of humor. 
 
MH: 
Oh, yeah; yeah. 
 
LG: 
So, for example – well paramedics, definitely. 
 
MH: 
They’re even worse. 
 
LG: 
Yeah, because they’re usually on the scene – they’re the first ones on the scene. 
 
MH: 
Well, and they’re being thrown up on, and –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
Covered in blood, and –  
 
LG: 
Yep. 
 
MH: 
Fought –  
 
LG: 
Yep. 
 
MH: 
Sometimes [laughs]. 
 
LG: 
But even like non-medical specialties, like Wall Street traders: so, they’re not responsible 
for people’s health, but –  
 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 36 
 
MH: 
Right. 
 
LG: 
But for people’s like kind of financial well-being, have this kind of very edgy – I 
wouldn’t say necessarily dark, but just there’s a lot of humor –  
 
MH: 
Um-hmm, cops. 
 
LG: 
So, I think – yeah, yep, exactly: firefighters –  
 
MH: 
And soldiers –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm; yeah, military is another one. So, I think it just emerges in certain kinds of 
professions. And with medicine, like I said, it’s that concept of suffering and death in 
relation to humor –  
 
MH: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
That I’d like to write about. 
 
[53:01] 
 
MH: 
I would be very interested, and I don’t know if you could, how one would do this, but 
going back to what we talked about earlier, about the suicide epidemic right now –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
MH: 
I would be very interested in knowing, because I think that there is something protective 
in the ability to kind of bathe in this darkness without becoming –  
 
LG: 
Swallowed up by it? 
 
MH: 
Yeah. And I wonder if – and I’m not saying that humor enables you to do that – but I 
wonder if the humor that (that dark humor) reflects a wiring that protects against the kind 
of suicidal –  
 
 
Because I’ve got (and again, nothing but love for the people commit suicide), but I’ve 
never contemplated suicide – even in my darkest, most miserable, horrible days in 
medicine and life: never thought about it. But I’m a pretty dark guy. 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] Right. 
 
MH: 
And I wonder if there’s something (and again, I’m just doing this from inside my head) –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 37 
 
MH: 
I wonder if there’s something in that wiring that protects you, you know? Because you 
often read about, you know, (not that you can necessarily trust what people say about 
dead people), but you know, “Oh, she was bubbly, the life of the party. She loved 
everybody,” you know, “she was the life and soul – she was always there for you.” Now, 
I don’t get a darkness from that. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
And I wonder if people (like me) who are a little dark –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm? 
 
MH: 
Are somehow immunized [laughs] – I don’t know – and it’s reflected in our humor? 
 
LG: 
Could be. 
 
MH: 
I don’t know. 
 
LG: 
It could be. Well I know that, you know, the characteristics of suffering (so, if you 
presume that somebody who has committed suicide has suffered) –  
 
MH: 
Sure, of course. 
 
LG: 
Hopelessness –  
 
MH: 
Um-hmm. 
 
[55:01] 
 
LG: 
Isolation, you know, feeling like nobody understands; there’s no way out, is really 
important; futility – like kind of lack of, like your whole kind of identity is called into 
question, or your whole worrldview is called into question.  
 
 
And I think sometimes in the practice of medicine, if you are feeling overwhelmed and 
like your efforts are futile, because people are dying, and you are tasked with the staving 
off of death, and you can’t talk to anyone because maybe you don’t have any – like 
maybe your family isn’t a medical family, so nobody understands –  
 
MH: 
Sure. 
 
LG: 
And you can’t talk to them, and things like that – I think (not all the time, but sometimes) 
the occupation of medicine creates those conditions. 
 
MH: 
Sure. 
 
LG: 
You know? 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 38 
 
 
MH: 
Sure, yeah. Yeah, I can see that. 
 
LG: 
That’s why I was sort of asking if you felt, you know, overwhelmed –  
 
MH: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
You know, when you were going through your training, or like if it was futile for this 
[laughing] essentially impossible task –  
 
MH: 
Oh yeah, no, absolutely; yeah.  
 
LG: 
And I think it can lead to those –  
 
MH: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
You know, those are all characteristics of suffering; and then if that goes on long enough 
–  
 
MH: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
And you don’t have resources –  
 
MH: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
You know? 
 
MH: 
Yeah, yeah; absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah, it’s a fascinating subject; it’s one that I’ve 
gotten a little more (not to any significant depth), but a little more interested in in the last 
few years, as I took on this role as program director –  
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
MH: 
Because you know, my job –  
 
LG: 
You’re looking at the students. 
 
MH: 
Is looking after the residents, yeah. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
And making sure that they’re doing okay in various ways. 
 
LG: 
When you say that they’re – that this country loses two classes –  
 
MH: 
Um-hmm. 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 39 
 
 
LG: 
A year to suicide, like how many people is that? 
 
MH: 
About 400. 
 
LG: 
Four-hundred? Okay. 
 
 
And then going back to jokes about stereotypes (or about specialties), what are some 
jokes about anesthesiologists? 
 
[57:02] 
 
MH: 
Well, some of it is fairly esoteric. So, one of the things we, you know, the ether screen (in 
class it’s what it’s described as): when they prep and drape a patient. 
 
LG: 
Oh, okay; um-hmm? 
 
MH: 
They put sterile drapes on them. And we hang one – we hang it up usually at the head of 
the bed, between two poles. And nowadays it’s to, you know, maintain sterility: like, 
“This is the end of your sterile field, don’t come up here,” kind of thing. But it’s referred 
to as an ether screen, because back in the day when we used ether, it was a way of 
keeping our anesthetic gas towards ours, and away from the surgeons, right? 
 
 
But (and I’m starting with a complimentary joke) we refer to that now as the blood-brain 
barrier. The blood-brain barrier is a structure in the brain that kind of insulates the brain 
from the blood; it’s physiologically complicated. But it’s a thing. And we refer to it as the 
blood-brain – meaning: the blood’s on that side, and the brain’s on this side.  
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
MH: 
Like the surgeons are –  
 
LG: 
Like you guys down there deal with it [laughing]. 
 
MH: 
Yeah, and we’re the brains. 
 
LG: 
Yeah [laughing]. 
 
MH: 
We’re the brains; so, a little [??]. 
 
 
The other classic one is (and you tell it from the first person), you’re like:  
“Yeah, I’m on a flight, I’m going to a conference in, you know, San Francisco (or 
whatever).” And suddenly there’s a call on the overhead, “Is there a physician on 
board? Is there (specifically) an anesthesiologist? Ideally, an anesthesiologist on 
board?” And so, I put my hand up and I’m like, “Yeah, what do you need an 
anesthesiologist for?” She says, “Well come on.”  
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 40 
 
 
And so, we come up and there’s an older gentleman sitting there on his chair, and 
the flight attendant says, “This is Dr. Harris, he’s an anesthesiologist.” And the 
gentleman turns to you and says, “Yeah, hi. I’m Dr. Smith; I’m a cardio-thoracic 
surgeon. I wondered if you could lower my seat for me.” 
 
LG: 
[Laughing] 
 
MH: 
And so, the joke – because the joke is there are some certain groups of surgeons who all 
they think that anesthesiologists do is raise and lower the stand –  
 
LG: 
Raise and lower the seats? 
 
MH: 
And tilt the table, and –  
 
[59:09] 
 
LG: 
[Laughs] 
 
MH: 
Because you know, sometimes you need to move the table around so they can see what 
they need to see, and all that. And we do – that’s part of our job; but that’s the classic 
joke is they want us to lower the seat back. 
 
LG: 
Have you ever heard the anesthetists’ hymn? 
 
MH: 
I don’t think so? Oh, is that the English folk on –  
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
MH: 
Yeah, yeah, I have heard that. Yeah. 
 
LG: 
The amateur transplants [laughs]. 
 
MH: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
They talk about raising and lowering the seat [laughs]. 
 
MH: 
You know, one of the things we have, that I think a lot of people – one of the things about 
anesthesia is that it’s fairly esoteric; I mean, not everybody (even in medicine) really 
know what we do. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
Because anesthesia is not a required rotation in most medical (or a lot of medical) 
schools. 
 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 41 
 
LG: 
Oh. 
 
MH: 
So, most medical students – if they didn’t do anesthesia, didn’t do anesthesia. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
So, the jokes are fairly limited. You know, they talk about us doing crosswords and 
Sudoku, and stuff like that. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
They talk about us going home at three in the afternoon every day; and that’s about it. 
 
LG: 
Okay. 
 
MH: 
Because the rest of what we do is fairly esoteric; they really don’t know what we do 
(most of the time. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
And so, that kind of limits them, you know? 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. Why is anesthesia not a required rotation? 
 
MH: 
I think – there’s a deer in the yard. 
 
LG: 
I’m sorry? 
 
MH: 
There’s a deer in the yard. 
 
LG: 
Cool, look at that! A little baby one. 
 
MH: 
Just eating all my plants.  
 
LG: 
You’ve got a whole herd – oh look, there’s two fawns; there’s a fawn right there too. 
 
MH: 
Oh, yeah. Stop eating my damn plants! 
 
 
So, it’s kind of viewed as a sub-specialty of a sub-specialty, right? It’s kind of viewed as, 
“Okay, you’re interested in surgery, but you don’t want to do surgery, you want to do 
anesthesia.” So, it’s kind of viewed as several iterations down, some kind of –  
 
LG: 
Okay. 
 
MH: 
Some kind of taxonomy. And then we’re usually not a very big department. Our 
department here actually is pretty big, but most institutions it’s not necessarily a very big 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 42 
 
department, so there’s not a lot of people to be on committees (especially like curriculum 
committees) and push for –  
 
LG: 
A rotation? 
 
[1:01:18] 
 
MH: 
A rotation. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
Second (whatever we’re on) – thirdly, because the departments are not necessarily very 
big, you don’t necessarily have the ability to take a lot of students. So, we have 125 
medical students; so, we would have to have the capacity (over the course of a year) to 
take 125 medical students in the OR. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
I think we could probably do it, but it might not be a universal –  
 
LG: 
A lot of arranging? 
 
MH: 
For – yeah. The other thing is that it is erroneously not considered to be a popular 
specialty. So, a lot of people are like, “Why are we going to send all these people to do 
anesthesia, when you know, there’s hardly any of them are ever going to go into it?” 
 
 
Actually, this year’s class at the U, a fifth of them are applying to anesthesia. 
 
LG: 
That’s huge. 
 
MH: 
Yes. 
 
LG: 
Wow. 
 
MH: 
So, there’s that. And then the other –  
 
LG: 
Is it competitive? Is it a pretty competitive specialty? 
 
MH: 
Oh yeah, yeah. And then there’s – it is now; it didn’t use to be. Over the years – well 
most things wax and wane, but –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm; but it’s gotten more competitive? 
 
MH: 
But for a while – yeah, in the last few years it’s gotten really competitive. 
 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 43 
 
 
I think there’s also a perception that even if it is popular amongst those kids who want to 
do it, well they’ll just do it anyway; all these other kids who don’t want to do it – well 
there’s really nothing for them to gain. And I think that is the big problem I have with it, 
is that I think we have a hell of a lot to teach people. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
We are clinical physiologists, right? 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
We manipulate physiology on a minute by minute basis. So, even if you’re not going to 
do anesthesia, that is an invaluable lesson in physiology. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
And then there’s also the component of there’s stuff we can and cannot do that surgeons 
and internists and radiologists, and all the other specialties need to know, because we’re 
everywhere in the hospital. We do stuff for cardiology, we do stuff for surgery 
(obviously), we do stuff for the GI doctors, we do stuff for radiology (when they need 
someone sedated for some kind of procedure). So, we’re all over the place, and it would 
be very useful for those specialties to know, “Oh wait, that’s a stupid thing to ask an 
anesthesiologist to do; they can’t do that, I remember from my rotation.” Right? 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
And then the skills, you know, putting in IVs, putting in endotracheal tubes, masking 
somebody –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
All those kind of things, which would be invaluable. So, we’re actually thinking about 
trying to push, and seeing if we can become a required rotation.  
 
LG: 
Yeah, I guess I had presumed that medical students went through all the specialties, so –  
 
MH: 
No. 
 
LG: 
I didn’t know that. 
 
MH: 
It largely ends up being who is on the committee. For example, they do six weeks of 
psychiatry at the University of Utah. 
 
LG: 
That’s a lot of psychiatry. 
 
[1:03:55]

MH: 
That’s a lot of psychiatry and it is not a particularly popular special. 
 
LG: 
Yeah; it seems like you could do three and three: three anesthesiology –  
 
MH: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Three psychiatry or something? 
 
MH: 
Yeah, right; exactly. And you know, internal medicine, surgery – they’re the kind of core, 
foundational – and you need to, of course, you need to do a bunch of that stuff: family 
practice, of course. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
OB, all that stuff, of course. But once you get down the list a little bit, I really don’t see 
why six weeks of psychiatry is more valuable than six weeks of anesthesia? 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm, um-hmm; well, it’s probably the histories of like those –  
 
MH: 
I’m sure. 
 
LG: 
How the curriculum developed. 
 
MH: 
And they’ve got – they all have people sitting on those committees, and you know, 
they’ve just got this –  
 
LG: 
Entrenched. 
 
MH: 
Yeah, this self-perpetuating kind of thing. 
 
LG: 
Let me just glance at my questions, see if there’s anything –  
 
MH: 
Sure. 
 
LG: 
Yeah, most of these we answered [inaudible, really soft, low voice] almost all these.  
 
 
Do you think, is there anything else on the topic of, you know, sort of humor in 
relationship to medical training, and the difficulties of medical training that we haven’t 
talked about, that you think is important? 
 
MH: 
No. I mean, I think we’re at an interesting time in our culture (by our culture, I mean 
medicine and western culture in general). But you know, we’re getting a little more (as 
we should) sensitive to (for wont of a better phrase) political correctness. And so I think 
some of these jokes are being analyzed (appropriately so) for their appropriateness. 
 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris

LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
When I think one of the potential problems is one that you highlighted when you were 
talking about your rape class –  
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
Is that, the kind of knee-jerk response is often, “Oh, you said the word rape in a joke, 
therefore it’s terrible.” 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
[1:06:09] 
 
MH: 
Right? Or, “You said the word cancer in a joke, therefore it’s terrible; you’re making 
light of cancer.” Right? And I think that that is a problem, because I do think that humor 
(in all walks of life), and in particularly the medical field, is beneficial. I think it’s 
beneficial to physicians and healthcare providers, I think it’s beneficial to patients. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
And I think if we get too wild and crazy about – I hate to say political correctness, 
because –  
 
LG: 
Tamping down on it? 
 
MH: 
Yeah; I think we need to legitimately – and that’s why I think your project is terrific, this 
idea of sincerely and legitimately looking at humor and its function, and why it’s good, 
and when it can be bad – is good: we should be looking at this in a scientific (not a knee-
jerk) way. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
Because it absolutely – and not only, it’s like art – okay, now I’m getting pretentious. It’s 
like art –  
 
LG: 
It is like art. 
 
MH: 
Of any sort, right? When you start restricting – it speaks to the human condition, it can 
help us; and when you start covering up Rodins with sheets, then you’re killing the art. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. But it’s also – humor is by nature boundary-crossing. 
 
MH: 
Um-hmm. 
 
LG: 
You know, like that’s what it does. 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 46 
 
 
MH: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
You know, it allows people to speak about things in ways that they’re not allowed to 
speak about. 
 
MH: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
It’s a primary in which humor –  
 
 
I have been reading an interesting book on Holocaust humor; you know, so there’s a 
context of enormous suffering –  
 
MH: 
Yeah, oh god, yeah. 
 
LG: 
Terrible. 
 
MH: 
Yeah, yeah. 
 
LG: 
Probably you know, one of the worst in the world. And in not just from people in 
concentration camps, but you know, people in Germany, people in occupied countries:  
proliferation of jokes –  
 
MH: 
Um-hmm? 
 
LG: 
Asides, you know, satirical songs – and the topics were all, you know, beatings, torture, 
death, starvation – like terrible topics. And in that context it is very clear, like the 
suffering caused by you know, the Nazis, this was the only thing people could do. 
 
[1:08:44] 
 
MH: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
It was the only –  
 
MH: 
Well and it’s also a way – for me anyway, I’m not the most self-analytical person in the 
world, in fact, now I can say I’m the least self-analytical person in the world –  
 
 
Bu for me, anyway, humor over the years has been a way of exploring what’s going on 
with this thing (whatever it happens to be). 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
You know? Because oftentimes I’ll reflexively respond with humor; I’ll reflexively have 
a joke, or a quip, or something. 
 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 47 
 
LG: 
That’s your first response? 
 
MH: 
Yeah; and then I’ll be like, “Whoa, no that was,” you know, I’ll kind of lik,e self-critique 
and be like, “Well that didn’t feel right; why didn’t that feel right?” That’s a way for me 
to access that kind of tiny, little self-analytical part of myself that I can then go, “Okay, 
why was that problem for me? That felt wrong for me to say that.” 
 
LG: 
It gives you a way to think about it? 
 
MH: 
Yeah; and then in the larger context, I wonder if that’s a way for society (for medical 
society, medical culture) to address things, you know? 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
The idea that – because a lot of these jokes are kind of universal –  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
You know? Like for example, the nephrologist one more dialysis joke, right? Okay, that’s 
a common joke – I guarantee your husband knows that joke. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm; I think he told it to me. 
 
MH: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
So, that’s a short-hand way for us to go, “Okay, let’s talk about that thing. Let’s talk 
about that concept. Like, what are we going to do about that?” 
 
LG: 
Um-hmm. 
 
MH: 
Right? It’s a meme. 
 
LG: 
Right, yeah. 
 
MH: 
Literally, yeah. 
 
LG: 
I’m sure you’ve heard the nickname for the Huntsman Cancer Institute? Poison and False 
Hope. 
 
[Laughter] 
 
 
That’s one of the harsher ones I’ve heard. 
 
MH: 
I’ve not heard that one before. Well you know, we refer to the IMC as the Death Star? 
Physician Oral History: Mark Harris 
Page 48 
 
 
LG: 
No [laughing], I didn’t know. 
 
[1:10:43] 
 
MH: 
And people always take that the wrong way; it’s usually non-Star Wars fans who get it 
wrong, right? Because they always think that we’re saying they kill people. 
 
LG: 
Yeah. 
 
MH: 
Well no they don’t; they’re job is to – that thing was designed to eradicate all other 
competition –  
 
LG: 
Everything else [laughs]. 
 
MH: 
It was not killing patients, it’s killing other healthcare systems. 
 
LG: 
[Laughing] That’s a good one. 
 
MH: 
But people always think of it as killing patients.  
 
LG: 
Yeah, I think they had a similar nickname for Methodist Hospital in Indiana. 
 
MH: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
In Indianapolis, it was like Mothership, or something like that.  
 
MH: 
Yeah, yeah. We refer to the U as the Big House. 
 
LG: 
The what? 
 
MH: 
The Big House. 
 
LG: 
The Big House. 
 
MH: 
Yeah, and that actually speaks to that – it’s a shorthand way of encapsulating a whole 
bunch of concepts in one: little quip, or a nickname, or whatever.  
 
LG: 
Um-hmm.  
 
MH: 
Yeah. 
 
LG: 
Well thank you so much. 
 
MH: 
Oh, I’m happy to do it.

LG: 
I’ve been very grateful for your being willing to talk, and enthusiastic and all that. 
 
 
I’m going to do a closing tag –  
 
MH: 
Sure. 
 
LG: 
Again, this is Lisa Gabbert; I’ve been talking to Dr. Mark Harris, in his home in Salt 
Lake City. And today is September 6th, 2018.
