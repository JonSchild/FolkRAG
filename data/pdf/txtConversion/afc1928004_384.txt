POOR BUT A GENTLEMAN STILL 
As sung by W ILLIAM SCANLAN, at the Olympic Theatre, Broad-
way, N. Y., with unbounded applause. 
Music and words published by E. Ilarding, 229 Bowery. 
Price 10 cts. 
Don't think by my dress that I've come here to beg, 
Though the sharp pangs of hunger I 
feel, 
The cup of misfortune I've drained to the dregs, 
But I'm proud if I'm shabby genteel. 
A 
time was when swells who met me would say, 
Ah I 
Harry, my boy, come and dine," 
But now when they meet me they look the other way, 
My company now they decline. 
CHORUS. 
Though poverty daily looks in at my door; 
I'm hungry, fin foot- sore and ill, 
I 
can look this whole world in the face and can say, 
If I'm poor, I'm a 
gentleman still. 
I 
can look this whole world in the face and can say, 
If I'm poor, Pm a 
gentleman still ! 
One evening last week a. 
e 
other end of town, 
Whilst wandering sadly along, 
I 
picked up a 
purse which a 
lady had dropped ; 
The temptation to keep it was strong, 
My pockets were empty, but firmly I 
said, 
She shall have her own, come what will. 
She looked at my dress as I 
gave it and said, 
If you're poor you're a 
gentleman still! 
Though poverty, &c. 
Last evening I 
rescued a 
poor homeless girl 
Whom a 
swell was insulting; I 
found 
My strength for the moment, was something immense, 
As I 
hurled the great brute to the ground. 
He cried out, you beggar, don't meddle with me, 
Or you'll very soon get a 
pill. 
I 
said, lay a 
hand on that girl and you'll find 
If I'm poor I'm a 
v.entleman still. 
Though poverty,

DORKINS 1 NIGHT. 
Written by BOBBY NEWCOMB, and sung with great success by 
W ILLIAM SCANLAN, at the Olympic Theatre, Broadway, N. Y. 
Music published by JOHN PERRY, Washington St., opposite Boston 
Theatre, Boston, Mass. 
The theatre was full—it was Dorkins' night— 
That is, Dorkins was going to appear 
At night, in a 
favorite comedy part, 
For lie was comedian here. 
Funny ! why, he'd make you laugh, till the tears 
Ran down your face like rain; 
And every time he came on the stage, 
You'd try to stop laughing in vain. 
A 
family? yes, he'd a 
family, 
And he lov'd them as dear as his life; 
And you'd scarcely find a 
happier lot 
Than Perkins' children and wife. 
And you'd scarcely find a 
happier lot 
Than Dorkins' children and wife. 
There came one night, and I 
was in front, 
And Dorkins was going to play 
A 
character new to himself and the stage, 
Which he'd trod for many a 
day. 
By eight the theatre was perfectly jammed, 
All awaited a 
pleasant surprise; 
For they knew they'd laugh ' till their sides would ache 
And they long'd for the curtain to rise. 
The play soon began—each neck was stretched forth, 
And eagerly watched each eye, 
For Dorkins to make his first entrance, and then 
To give him a 
cheerful hi! hi! 
For Dorkins to make his first entrance, and then 
To give him a 
elle. 
erful hi ! hi! 
At last he appeared, amid loud applause, 
But something was wrong you could see; 
" 
Why, Perkins is playing quite badly to-night!" 
The people said, sitting 'round me. 
A hiss! yes, it was; I 
saw Dorkins start 
As if stung by a 
serpent's fang; 
And he'd cast a 
beseeching look all 'round, 
While his head on his breast he would hang. 
" 
He's drunk!" some one said, and I 
thought so myself, 
For, to me, it was awful at times, 
To see how he'd struggle along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines, 
To see how he'd struggle along with his part, 
And continually stick in his lines. 
The footlights, at last, he approached very slow, 
And, " Ladies and gentlemen," said— 
"If I 
cannot please you to- night, 
The fault's not the heart, but the head. 
There's many a 
night I've made you all laugh, 
When so ill I 
could scarcely well stand; 
And every effort was pain to me then— 
Yes, if even I'd raise but my hand. 
You hiss me to-night, and say that I'm drunk," 
From his heart came a 
sob and a 
moan; 
"I'll tell you the reason—I 
know you won't laugh— 
I've a 
little one dying at home! 
I'll tell you the reason—I 
know you won't laugh— 
I've a 
little one dying at home I"

POVERTY, 
Written by W ILLIAM SCANLAN, and sung by SCANLAN & CRONIN, 
in their Original Sketch, entitled " POVERTY." 
Farewell, dear home, farewell to all 
The comforts of this world. 
We're ould, we're helpless and forlorn. 
In the street from our home we are hurled. 
A 
time was when joy ne'er left our home, 
Oh, ' twas then our poor hearts beat with glee, 
But now to the poor house we must go, 
The cause is poverty. 
CHORUS. 
May Heaven protect us day and night, 
Where ever we may be; 
So to the poor house we must go; 
The cause is poverty. 
I've looked for work, but all in vain— 
They say that I'm too ould, 
I've gone and begged from door to door 
To keep out the hunger and cold; 
But Mary, dear, when we are dead, 
And they ask what became of you and me, 
They can never say we robbed or stole, 
But died from poverty. 
May Heaven, kc. 
FIFTH AVENUE GEORGE. 
Written by JOSEPH P. 
SICELLEY. 
Sung by SCANLAN and CRONIN, in their great character sketch, 
"The Swells," written by W ILLIAM SCANLAN. 
Music and words published by E. 
II. 
HARDING, 229 Bowery. 
Fifth Avenue George is a 
charmer, 
And every dear creature will swear, 
Of fashion he's always the leader, 
No gent with his style can compare. 
Re leads an existence of pleasure, 
While blest with a 
fortune so large; 
And every one gives the opinion, 
There's none like Fifth Avenue George. 
CHORUS. 
Fifth Avenue George, Fifth Avenue George, 
Upon him the girls fondly smile. 
For fun and good cheer to the boys he is dear, 
He's the leader of fashion and style. 
He wears a " Knox " hat made to order, 
And his diamond can vie with the sun: 
A 
gold-headed cane he keeps twirling— 
As a 
swell he is " A No. I!" 
lie can waltz like a 
girl in the ballet, 
And sing like a 
signor from Rome; 
In ey'ry grand parlor or ball- room, 
Fifth Avenue George is at home. 
' 
Fifth Avenue, etc. 
He thinks every business is vulgar, 
He can't comprehend the hard times; 
His manner is very romantic, 
And he talks about poets and rhymes. 
He plays " philopene " with the ladies, 
And flirts with the belles all Around; 
Each day on Broadway promenading, 
Fifth Avenue George can be found. 
Fifth Avenue, etc. 
RIVAL JUNK MEN. 
Originally performed by SCANLAN & CRONIN, the most perfect 
Representatives of Irish Character now on the 
American Stage. 
Have ye's any ould rags or <mid bottles, my friends, 
That ye's want to sell ? 
I'm " Paddy Welsh," of the Fourth Ward, 
And of me ye've all heard tell. 
I'm known by every chick and child 
As a 
man of great exploit, 
And to be mayor or alderman, 
If I 
said the word I 
moight. 
I'm twenty long years in this land. 
For politicians I 
have no use. 
I 
neither ax nor borrow their aid, 
And as for me they can go to the deuce. 
As up the street I 
go each day, 
They know who's coming, well. 
With my bag on my back, I 
shout, 
Any ould rags or ould bottles to sell. 
(
dance.) 
ENTER RIVAL. 
Iood evening to ye's, one and all. 
I 
see ye're looking well. 
I 
suppose ye all will be surprised 
At what I'm going to tell. 
I've been travelling about the Ward all day, 
Not a 
pound of rags can I 
buy, 
Because that blackguard, " Paddy Welsh." 
Has been there on the sly. 
But I'll take my oath that I'm a 
bloat. 
If I 
don't make him sick. 
The first time I 
clap my eyes on him 
I'll paralyze him with a 
brick; 
I'll twist his nose till the blood it flows, 
And me he'll remember, well. 
To come no more in the Sixth Ward, hollering, 
Any ould rags or ould bottles to sell 
I3OTE. 
Now what's the use of all this fuss ? 
Our reputation I'm sure we'd spoil 
To see us quarreling here like dogs, 
Two sons of the Emerald Isle; 
So let us shake hands and be good friends, 
This rivalry let us stop, and to bind the bargain 
Let us go and of whisky take a 
drop. 
But there's one thing we must bear in mind, 
That our rules are sobriety. 
Sure if they found out we drank rum 
We'd be kicked out of the Society. 
So say no more but on we'll go, 
Or some one they might tell; 
And we'll go about our business, hollering. [What I] 
Any ould rags or ould bottles to sell.

PAT DELANEY, 
Sung by JOHN SCANLA.N, the rising comique, with tremendous 
applause. 
Air.—" Eileen Alanna." 
My name is Pat Delaney, I 
came from Tralee, 
I 
live in a 
great big tenement house, way up in Avenue C; 
There's a 
family lives next to me that keeps up a 
terrible roar 
About Eileen _Manna and their augus asthore. 
First their youngest boy, and then their eldest brother, 
All join in the chorus with the sister and his mother; 
When I 
get home at night, boys, I 
hear that terrible roar 
Of Eileen Alanna and their augus asthore. 
Cnonus. 
Working hard all day, I 
think it mighty hard, 
Climbing up a 
forty foot ladder ,
carrying a 
great big hod, 
When I 
get home at night, boys, to hear that terrible roar, 
Of Eileen Alanna and their aligns asthore. 
Early in the morning, befo 
Before I 
ate a 
mouth 
re I 
do get up, 
ul, or before I 
drink a 
sup; 
They be singing in the hallway ' till my heart it is quite sore, 
About Eileen Alanna and their augus asthore. 
If I 
had influe 
I'd go and 
strong. 
I'd have them all arrested, and that would stop their roar, 
Of Eileen Alanna and their auffus asthore. 
Working hard, etc.

do belong,

DRAW IT MILD. 
Written and sung by W ILLIAM SCANLAN. 
Let's learn to temper our wishes, 
For there's many a 
thing we desire, 
Which on the morrow is worthless, 
And makes nature a 
vivid satire. 
Young men whose fathers are wealthy, 
In dissipation their hours do beguile; 
Get all you can from the old man, 
But remember draw it mild. 
CHORUS. 
For those who wish to be much in life, 
My advice, to man, woman or child, 
Is, go it strong while you are young, 
But remember, draw it mild. 
To the blushing -
timid of sweet sixteen, 
At whom Cupid flings his dart, 
Le 
at first sight's not always right, 
And leads to an aching heart. 
To all who believe in passion divine, 
And on whom the fates have smiled; 
Love's filter use, but don't abuse, 
And remember, draw it mild. 
To all who would an evil shun, 
Be he defaulter or politician; 
honor or duty can't be bought, 
So give up sordid ambition. 
Or else like evil doers, 
Upon whom riches are piled; 
A day of recovery soon will come, 
Unless yon draw it mild. 
To those, etc. 
To those, etc. 
HIP! HIP!! HURRAH! 
Written by George Seobbie. 
Music and words published by E. Harding, 225 Bowery, N. Y. 
Sung by SCAMAN k Cuoxix, with great success. 
I'VE just been out to see the boys, 
They invited me to drink. 
Well knowing if we taste life's joys 
We must not stop to think. 
And that's about the right idea, 
At least I've found it so. 
To shout and cheer, drink wine and beer, 
No matter where we go. 
To shout and cheer, drink wine and beer. 
No matter where we go. 
CHORUS. 
Then hip hurrah ! hip hurrah ! we'll go and have a 
spree. 
Hip hurrah ! hip hurrah! so come along with me. 
Hip hurrah! hip hurrah! let's go and have a 
lark. 
We never will go home, no, not while it's dark. 
well for fogies to deny, 
The pleasures they forgo, 
And tell us that we've got to die, 
We know that to be so. 
Let them enjoy life as they may, 
And we will do the same. 
Our spirits light, our hearts are gay, 
And we'll uphold our name. 
Our spirits light, our hearts are gay. 
And we'll uphold our name. 
Then hip hurrah! titc., 
I 
care not how the times may go, 
I 
never look for pain. 
I 
do not choose to search for woe, 
For one I 
do refrain. 
So come and join me in my spree, 
And have a 
jolly game. 
We now start in with one, two, three. 
Hurrah! we're off again. 
We now start in with one, two, three, 
Hurrah I 
we're off again. 
Then hip hurrah! Ix.,

LOG CABIN. 
As sung by BILLY and M AGGIE RAT. 
I 
,
tM getting old and feeble now, I 
cannot work no more, 
I 
have laid the rusty-bladed hoe to rest, 
Ci'd Massa and old Missus they') e 
sleeping side by side, 
And their spirits are now roaming with the blest;. 
Things are changed about the place, the darkies all am gone, 
And I 
cannot hear them singiug in the cane, 
And the only friend that's left me is that little boy of mine. 
In my little old log cabin in the lane. 
• 
There was a 
happy time to me not many years ago, 
When the darkies used to gather round the door, 
They used to sing and dance at night, and play the old banjo, 
But alas, they cannot do it any more; 
The hinges are all rusty now, the door is tumbling down, 
And the roof lets in the sunshine and the rain, 
Oh! the only friend that's left me is that little boy of mine, 
In my little old log cabin in the lane. 
BOY. 
Oh! daddy, don't you be so sad and melancholy now, 
For you there's many happy days in store, 
Although you're old and feeble, your boy is young and strong, 
And will love and cherish you for evermore: 
I'll try and do the best I 
can to make you happy now, 
I'll comfort and protect you from all pain.

And the angels they will bless us in our happy little home, 
our little old log cabin in the lane. 
OLD MAN. 
Oh, child I 
am contented, but the day must quickly come, 
When I'll have to leave this earth for evermore, 
The angels they will take me Irom my humble little cot, 
And waft me to that bright celestial shore.

I've Only Been Down to the Club.

Bowery, New York. 
Last night I 
was out rather late— 
'Twas only an innocent spree— 
My wife for my coming did wait, 
When sleeping I 
thought she would be; 
found her in temper and tears; 
Oh she cried, it's a 
sin and a 
shame— 
And she scratched both my eyes and my ears ., 
But I 
told her I 
soon would explain. 
CHORUS. 
The " Club" had a 
meeting, to night, love. 
Of bus'ness we had a 
great sight, love; 
Don't think for a 
moment I'm tight love, 
I've, only been down to the Club. 
My boots I 
left down in the hall,

011ALLERAN, THE BRAVE POLICEMAN. 
Anew a 
original song, written and sung by W ILLIAM SeANLAN, 
in his new and original sketch entitled, " Wanted a 
Lod-
ger; or the Life of a 
Mulberry Street Policeman." 
My name is O'Halleran, and fro 
Ireland I 
came, 
And since I 
came here I've gained great fame; 
The'captains and aldermen all know me well, 
And my herosim and bravery they can easily tell; 
If at night on my beat I 
walk to and fro, 
The blaaguards they see me, arrah from me they'll go, 
To an alleyway or bar-room they'd run if they can, 
For they all know well I'm a 
brave policeman. 
Citonus. 
For as I 
promenade my beat at night through the street, 
Pm admired by every young lady I 
meet; 
You'll hear them all sigh as hard as they can, 
For they're all deep in love with this brave policeman. 
When I 
first came from Ireland I 
was rather green, of course, 
But I 
very soon got smart when I 
went on the force; 
'Twas then I 
picked up, and my courage did show, 
And was greeted no matter where'er I 
did go; 
As we led the parade on Saint Patrick's day, 
You can bet we looked grand as we all marched away; 
My countrymen would shout " Hurrah for O'Halleran, 
He's the pet of the force, and a 
brave policeman. 
For as I 
promenade, & c. 
I 
was very soon promoted to a 
ronndsman you see, 
And respected no matter where'er I 
inhdit be; 
They put sthripes on my arms to look solid and grand, 
For they knew I 
was a 
hero from dear Paddy's land; 
But it's very strange, my friends, if I 
don't soon be mayor, 
For there's not a 
man more able or fit for that chair, 
And providing they will, I'll do everything I 
can, 
To hould my reputation as a 
true Irishman. 
For as I

THE env I'm going to sing about, 
I'm very fond to tell, 
Is a 
member of my family, 
You ought to know dim well; 
He keeps the corner store above. 
Where he sells his beer and wine, 
And he holds a 
public sinecure, 
For he's a 
son of mine ! 
CHORUS. 
My son Charley ! 0, ne's the lad! 
q, hear them say he's awful! bad ! 
Such a 
boy I 
never had 
As my son Charley! 
My Charley is a 
citizen, 
And lie votes for Tammany Hall; 
They will put him up for Alderman, 
If he lives until next fall: 
He has the ward all to himself, 
And it'sthim that cuts a 
shine; 
He commands a 
great influence there, 
Fol he's a 
son of mine! 
My son, &c. 
He wears a 
handsome black mustache, 
And puffs his long brown hair, 
And in his breast immaculate, 
The richest emeralds glare; 
In a 
quiet neig,hborhood, up town, 
He has a 
girl so fine; 
And she's going to marry next Sunday week, 
This dearest son of mine!

SUCH A. NOSE, 
As sung with great success by Jolly Joe Banks. 
Good evening, pay attention, I'll now relate my woes, 
I 
trust I 
shall succeed in making friends instead of foes, 
Gaze on a 
wretched mortal who, no matter where he goes, 
Is sure to hear some fellow cry " Oh, ain't he got a 
nose." 
Chorus. 
Oh, ain't he got a 
nose—such a 
nose, what a 
nose, 
Well it's not so handsome, I 
suppose, 
For whenever I 
go out, all the people roar and shout, 
"Oh, my goodness" gracious! what a 
nose, look at the 
nose, 
I 
really can't make out why I 
was born with such a 
curse, 
For when some minutes old it was discovered by the 
nurse, 
That my eyes were like my daddy's, they were startled, I 
suppose, 
For she dropped me on the floor, and cried, " Oh, ain't he 
• 
got a 
nose !" 
Oh, ain't he got, tkc. 
Oh, aint he got a 
nose, such a 
nose, what a 
nose, 
Won't it be ugly when lie older grows, 
And whenever he goes out, all 
the boysjwill bawl and 
shout : 
"Suffering Cornelius," what a 
nose, shoot the nose. 
When I 
was thirteen years of age, my friends sent me to 
school, 
I 
know l'm not to blame at all, tor turning out a 
fool, 
For when to say my lessons at the master's desk I 
rose, 
Every boy in school would shout: " Oh, ain't he got a 
nose !" 
Oh, ain't he got, &c, 
Oh, ain't he got a 
snoot, such a 
snoot, what a 
snoot— 
Did you ever see such a 
dizzier galloot, 
And the little boys would cry, whenever I 
passed by. 
'Oh cheese it, " " stash it," "drop on that awful snoot," 
"blow yer snoot." 
23 
Then as I 
older grew I 
thought, I'd settle down for life, 
I 
expected that I'd found the girl that suited for a 
wife, 
I 
popped the question, blushing just as red as any rose, 
When my charmer roared and giggled out, " Oh, ain't 
you got a 
nose !" 
Oh, ain't you got, &c. 
Oh, ain't you got a 
smeller, what a 
smeller, such a 
smeller, 
it's the worst I 
ever saw on any feller, 
Go and bury it in a 
cellar, all the gang would shout and 
beller, 
Oh, hoist an umbrella over that nose, pipe the nose. 
It's a 
very fearful thing for a 
chap to have it to say 
That no matter where he goes at all, his " bugle 's in the 
way," 
To the theatre I 
went the other night, the curtain had just 
arose, 
When a"god" in the gallery hollered out : " Oh, telescope 
that nose." 
Oh, ain't lie got, &c-
Oh, ain't 1 
got a 
horn, " blow yer horn," " sound yer 
horn," 
I 
often wish I 
never had been born 
But I'll try to do what's right, and come here some other 
night, 
And try to show you how I "sound my horn," sure's yer 
born, 
?.

DON'T WAKE THE BABY. 
As sung by BILLY PASTOR. 
If you perceive my bosom heave, 
"Vs caused by proud delight, 
For I'm a 
very different man 
To what I 
was last night. 
For some time in my house a 
nurse 
Has aired her awkward charms, 
But, I'm glad to say, this morning 
I've found something in her arms. 
SPOKEN.—I 
said to the nurse in a 
very innocent sort of a 
manner: - Why, laws, missy, what have you got in your 
arms?" She placed her finger on her lips and said, " h—s—h— 
CHORUS. 
Don't make a 
noise or else you'll wake the baby, 
Don't make a 
noise or else you'll wake the child; 
Don't kick up a 
row or else you'll disturb the infant," 
I 
feel so awfully awfully jolly, I 
think I 
shall go 
wild! 
As soon as e'er the news spread 'round, 
In every neighbor comes; 
Some said " what a 
darling child !" 
And others " Bless its gums!" 
My feelings were so glorious, 
Describe them no one can, 
And the ladies seem to look on me 
As a 
very dere,- man. 
SPOKEN.—" Why," said they, "lir. Snooks, Mr. Snooks, you 
ought to be a 
very happy man ;" " I 
am, / am!" I 
replied, and 
I 
would have given away to my feelings and kicked up a 
row, only for the nurse, in her suggestive manner, said 
Don't make a 
noise, 4c c. 
To-day I 
married, so was Jones, 
Who said, quite on the sly— 
" 
Who'll be a 
happy father first, 
I 
wonder, you or I ?'' 
Jones always thinks he's No. 1, 
But to-day that bliss is mine, 
And when we meet, we'll have some fun, 
I'll crack a 
case of wine. 
25 
SPOKEN.—Yes, and I'll make Jones drink the darling's 
health, and while he's drinking I'll say, " Jonesey, old boy, 
Don't make a 
noise, & c. 
With a 
parent's fond affection now, 
I 
feel all of a 
glow, 
But what to call the lovely babe, 
I 
don't exactly know. 
I'd like to call him something grand, 
And worthy of a 
Snooks, 
And when he's christened you must come 
And see how nice he looks. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, I'll invite you all to attend the christening, 
but remember, h—s—h— 
Don't make a 
noise, &c.

PAGE. 
Music by VINCENT DAVEES. 
I've been dining and wining to-day you can see, 
In a 
manner remarkably loose, 
And to go on a 
spree I 
know would suit me, 
For I 
mustn'n go home, 'tis no use. 
Oh I 
do feel so gay, so reckless and gay, 
My spirits so lively and spruce, 
I 
could sing or play in a 
juvenile way, 
For I 
do feel so awfully loose. 
CHORUS. 
I 
do feel so awfnlly loose, so loose, 
I 
do feel so awfully loose, so loose, 
Of course you can see I'm out on a 
spree, 
For I 
do feel so awfully loose, 
I 
was walking and talking along Broadway, 
And feeling decidedly loose, 
I 
was laughing and chaffing with ladies so gay, 
The excitement must plead my excuse, 
All at once I 
descried a 
girl by my side, 
And my heart went pit- pat like the deuce ! 
For I 
give you ray word this would not have occurred 
Had I 
not felt so awfully loose. 
I 
do feel, &c. 
Then to woo and to coo I 
embraced every chance 
In a 
style that was certainly loose, 
For I 
pressed her to go to the Argyle to dance, 
And really would take no excuse. 
I 
said 'twould be bliss if she gave me a 
kiss, 
And to raise her veil tried to induce, 
Who is that! on my life! I've been courting my wife, 
Oh I 
did feel so awfully loose. 
I 
do feel, &c. 
• 
Now what she said and I 
said may easily be guessed 
We both felt remarkably loose, 
The dispute grew so warm that I 
thought it the best 
To leave her by way of a 
truce. 
So I 
left her behind, and comfort I 
find 
In imbibing the generous juice; 
Oh I 
shall get it hot, but I 
don't care a 
jot, 
Vim to- night I 
am out on the loose. 
I 
do feel, lee.

BOSTON FIRE. 
As Sung_by WILLIAM SCANLAN. 
(Air—" I'at Won't Go Home Till Morning.”) 
It was only on the tenth of last November, 
That we heard the news we ever shall remember, 
That the fire-king had oast its burning embers 
O'er another fated city in our land. 
As the woeful tidings flashed along the wire, 
Of this other sad catastrophe so dire, 
That Boston, beauteous city, was on fire, 
And sinking 'neath the fiend's relentless hand. 
CHORUS. 
Fire! fire ! was heard the cry, 
In every breeze that passed us by, 
And all the world did heave a 
sigh of pity; 
Fervent prayers to Heaven to aid, 
Before the fire in ruins laid, 
Fair Boston, beauteous .city. 
And all through the terrible commotion, 
The wind blew a 
gale from off the ocean, 
The brave firemen worked with all devotion, 
To laugh at their efforts yet it seemed; 
And soared with fiery prayer still higher, 
O'er chimney top, steeple and church spire, 
Till all was one vast flame of fire, 
And the light around the horizon gleamed. 
Fire ! fire! was heard, etc. 
But who saved the city from a 
panic, 
From the rule of a 
fire-king too tyrannic, 
But the brave-hearted firemen and mechanic, 
The best and the noblest in the land ; 
Far brighter than the soldier's record of glory, 
Are the names of those who live in song or story, 
Who rebuild the city to its former glory, 
And build her up, if possible, more grand. 
Curates. 
And soon will no trace remain, 
Of this vast sea of flame, 
Boston will rise again remember; 
Brave men will be found, 
Who will build a 
fairer town. 
Like Chicsvo, from the w 
ound, 
ilefore the trxi November,

Written and Composed by Scur.s,y & BARRY, and sung by 
them only. 
Farewell, Erin! we must part, 
We are leaving thy beautiful shore ; 
And it almost breaks our poor hearts, 
To think we shall se o 
thee no more. 
We are going amongst strangers, 
In a 
grand and glorious land; 
And we shall earn our living, 
With a 
strong and willing hand. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! my name is Con— 
And mine Mary Ann; 
Our father's name is Dinny! 
We are a 
happy Irish pair, 
From the County of Kilkinny. 
Quid Ireland is our birth-place, 
And we love it dearly ; 
When we think of leaving it 
It makes us feel kind of queerly; 
Oh! the happy days we spent there, 
When we were children, gay ; 
But now we're off for a 
foreign land, 
Called sweet America! 
Chorus as before. 
So we bid ye, one and all, adieu! 
Farewell, to ye, we say; 
We are going in the big steamship, 
across the great blue say; 
So clap your hands two or three times, 
It will fill our hearts with joy ; 
For here we are before ye, 
A 
happy Irish girl and boy.

frIE LITTLE CHURCH AROUND TUE 
CORNER. 
BY J. C. STEWART. 
Air--" The Veteran. 
'Twas in a 
Christian land, 
A veteran actor lay, 
Whose sands of life had near run out 
And soon must pass away: 
" 
I 
fear not death," quoth he, 
" 
My life has been upright ;" 
A heavenly smile passed o'er his face, 
A 
soul had taken flight, 
But, alas! he was an actor. 
His friends had gathered 'round, 
Their last respects to pay, 
And one who knew his christian heart, 
Now sadly wound his way 
To a 
minister, and begged, 
That he'd read a 
funeral prayer. 
" 
We never pray for Actors, no, 
But, I'll tell you where, 
There's a 
little church around the comer." 
In vain the friends did plead, 
But Sabine would not budge, 
Instead of trying to redeem, 
He fain would be the judge. 
The felon in his cell, 
Or murderer doomed to die, 
Can have a 
sermon read for them 
But not our friend, and why? 
Alas! he was an actor. 
With pity and disgust, 
The friends now turn toward 
A shepherd, who protects his flock, 
And lives to serve the Lord. 
The service he performed, 
And prayed for that poor soul, 
The friends discovered they had found 
A Chr!stian, not a 
fool, 
In thq lit tie church around the cre-noT,

Vali of joy you may be sure, 
Here and there we ramble round, 
Every place for pleasure bound; 
You shoukt see us day and night, 
In our honey moon's delight, 
Free from every care and woe, 
Singing merrily as we go. 
CHORUS. 
Sure, oh sure we'rle on our wedding tour ; 
We're a 
dandy pair, and the people stare 
Alike, the rich and poor; 
So gay, so gay the moments fly away, 
Our voices ring as we laugh and sing, 
While on our wedding tour. 
We have wandered to the sea, 
Where the waves are wild and free; 
Are have stood on mountains high, 
Gazing at the summer sky, 
Far away in Spain and France; 
We have watched the latest dance, 
And In Erin's 1ovely land, 
Oft we met r. friendly hand. 
Sure, oh sure .kc, 
Now we're going to settle down, 
In some corner of the town, 
There we hope our friends will call, 
Welcome is the word to all; 
We will have a

And besides a 
vacant chair ; 
Friendly words for every one,

You were more than all beside?

Bring again those happy days, 
With the never ending yearning, 
For my lips to speak thy praise ?

Are you waiting still to meet me.

OH ! I 
am a

I 
work along the shore, 
To keep the hungry wolves away 
From the poor ' longshoreman's door; 
I 
toil all day in the broiling sun 
On the ships that come from sea, 
From broad daylight till late at night 
For a 
poor man's family. 
CHORUS. 
Give us fair pay for every day 
Is what we ask of ye ; 
Our cause is right, 
We are out on a 
strike 
For a 
poor man's family. 
Oh ! the rich ones gilded carriages 
And horses swift and strong, 
Whin a 
poor man asks for a 
bite to eat 
They tell him he is wrong; 
Go take your shovel in your hand, 
Go out and work for me; 
Die or live they have nothing to give 
To a 
poor man's family. 
Give us, &c. 
They bring over their Italians 
And Chinamen from the South, 
Thinking they can do our work, 
Take the bread from out our mouths; 
The white man's children they must :, t.irve, 
Shure we will not agree 
To be put down like a 
worm ill the ground, 
And starve our family. 
Give us, &c. 
IN the dell where the brooklets gently flowing, 
On the bench ' neath the old willow tree, 
Where the birds their songs are sweetly singing, 
There my little one's waiting for me; 
And she knows well the sound of my footsteps, 
As I 
cross o'er the bridge by the lea, 
And I 
hasten with arms stretch'd to greet her, 
My little one waiting for me. 
And at night when daily toil is over, 
And I'm wending my way toward my home, 
My heart's always beating with pleasure, 
For my little one surely will come; 
As I 
pass o'er that clear rippling brooklet, 
There, watching, I 
always can see, 
On the bench ' neath the old weeping willow, 
My little one waiting for me.

Although far from home, yet memory still, 
From old scenes would never depart. 
Tho' the notes of the trumpet would sound an alarm, 
Tho' deaf'ning the cannon's loud roar, 
An angel stood guard and kept me from harm, 
'Twas my Molly who lives in Killmore. 
My old Killmore, &c. 
And now do I 
seek her with love in my heart, 
With pockets and spirits both light; 
From her and my home I'll never depart, 
Until 1 
forever take flight. 
Then come to me, Molly, I'm waiting to hear 
The voice of my lov'd one, asthore ; 
Don't be frighten'd my dear, 'tis your Pat that is near, 
He's come back to his love and Killmore.

INITIALS ON THE SAND. 
A Medley, Song and Dance. 
J. J. McDEamorr, 
for T. M. II ENGLEa. 
While sauntering by the seaside, 
Where the wavelets kissed the shore, 
And the moonbeams, gaily dancing, 
Heeded not the Ocean's roar 
My attention was attracted 
To a 
spot where dainty hand 
Had traced out in fancy letters 
Those initials on the sand, 
CHORUS. 
A. D. and J., the letter K., 
Forever they will stand 
Like diamonds, treasured in my heart,, 
Initials on the sand. 
For she's as sweet as any rose, 
As fair as any flower that grows 
She is the jewel of my heart, 
The Belle of all the land; 
I'll ne'er regret the night I 
met 
Initials on the sand. 
One evening, in the ball room, 
I 
beheld a 
beauty proud, 
In her handsome silks attired; 
She was mingling with the crowd, 
And while in the mazy Polka, 
On a 'kerchiefin her hand 
I 
espied the same initials 
I 
had see upon the sand.

We met on the piazza, 
Where the sea breeze gently blew;

My heart wrecked on Cupid's strand, 
Was now gone forever from me, 
Through initials on the sand.

dancer he was known for miles around; 
He hat a 
daughter Judy, and he asked me for to call, 
There's going to be some fun, says he, at Miss Maloney's Ball. 
And there we had such great delight, with now and then a 
jolly 
fight, 
Such ructions and destructions ' faith it was-a 
sight to see. 
The Flanagans and Fogarty's were there to join the spree,

I 
thought the house would tumble down at Miss Maloney's 
Ball.

I 
dressed up like a 
daisy, and I 
took my little stick, 
And up to ould Maloney's home I 
travelled mighty qui k, 
I 
met some girls upon the road, and in with them did fall, 
They came to exercise themselves at Miss Maloney's Ball. 
Young Rooney with his impudence, attempted to advance, 
And ask the sweet Miss Flanagan to join him in th dance, 
Sure then I 
got excited, and I 
knocked him through the wall, 
They brought him home with broken bones from Miss Maloney's 
Ball. 
They brought him home with broken bones from Miss Maloney's

Mulcahy got so tipsy 
He went sprawling on the floor, 
And when we got him to i

He tumbled through the door. 
He shouted " melia murther" 
And the girls began to squall, 
Which brought the neghbo.'s running in, 
To Miss Maloney's Ball. . 
The whiskey made us lively, 
And the dust began to fly, 
Malony's daughter fainted, 
And we thought she'd surely die. 
We picked her up and brought her to, 
When loudly sic dii 
all, 
" 
Long life to all the decent boys"

Price 10 cents. 
As sung by Tony PASTOR. 
I'm a 
rather unfortunate fellow, 
In fact it has ever been thus; 
Whatever I 
try to accomplish, 
Is certain to end in a 
fuss. 
But at last I'm in luck, and in love too; 
I've struck the Bonanza for sure, 
I've met with the sweetest of creatures; 
0, my joy I 
can scarcely endure ! 
CHORUS. 
where the 
I 
call her my love, my sweet little dove, 
My angel, my treasure, and ey'ry thing sweet! 
She's just seventeen, and walks like a 
queen, 
My life, ere I 
met her, was never complete. 
I 
never go walking without her, 
And she seldom goes without me ; 
Her hair hangs bewitching about her, 
And her smile is like sun-shine to see. 
She dances and sings like a 
fairy, 
And charms me each day more and more. 
No doubt you will say I'm enchanted, 
Many people have said so before. 
Chorus—T 
call her, & c. 
I 
buy her bouquets by the dozen, 
And sing my devotion in rhymes; 
She makes people think I'm her cousin, 
She's said so a 
great many times. 
I'm filled with a 
lover's distraction, 
And I'm often a 
little bit "blue 
But she says she'll be mine in the future, 
And her promise I 
know she'll keep true. 
Chorus—I 
call her, &e.

NEW YORK SOCIETY, 
A IR.—London 89ciety. 
As sung by JOHNNY M ARKS. 
I 
THINK I've travelled everywhere, and seen what's to be seen 
Wherever I 
may roam I 
make myself at home, 
I've flirted down to Long Branch to Newport I 
have been, 
To Saratoga, Rockaway and to Rome; 
I've seen society in every shape and form, 
I've watched the tide of fashions rise and fall; 
I've viewed it in its calm, [' ye seen it in its storm, 
And this is my conclusion after all. 
• CHORUS. 
Baden Baden Spa, France and Germany, 
Liverpool or London, Spain or Italy; 
In such society there's much variety, 
But nothing equals New York society. 
Society as soon as the New York season's o'er, 
Will to the sea run down, where in a 
bathing gown, 
it dabbles in the water or perhaps upon the shore, 
It yawns and wishes it was back in town, 
Mid though it may be nice to drink the nasty waters, 
And lose your money gambling at the Spa, 
,ind meet the sort of men you'd cut, at any place, 
The New York season I 
prefer by far. 
Baden Baden Spa, &a. 
society I've met with in old Ireland, mid the bogs, 
In Paris ever gay, in London every day, 
In Mount St. Bernard convent, with the monks and jolly dogs, 
At every place I 
think that I 
may say, 
Rut there's a 
charm in town, I 
can't help saying so, 
Which makes me like it more than all the rest, 
To the opera we go, and that will plainly show, 
Society in New York is the best.

NEVER GO BACK ON THE POOR. 
Written and compo.ed by Watt., especially for Messrs. Harris and 
Brady and sung by them with great success. 
Ana:—Don't put your rooter. a 
man when he's down, 
In this world of sorrow, of toil and regret, 
There are scenes I 
would gladly pass o'er, 
But stern truth compels that each fact must be told, 
That thro' life we may check them the more. 
Is it right that a 
man who has well earned his pay 
On the pipes by the sweat of his brow, 
Should wait like a 
beggar on Green day by day, 
Or else home in hunger to go? 
CHORUS. 
If a 
man is in trouble, remember this song, 
Go drive the grim wolf from his docr, 
Assist him in need. you will seldom be wrong, 
If you never go back on the poor. 
From the wild waste of waters a 
death-cry came, 
As dashed on the iron- bound shore, 
A 
noble ship struck in the darkness of night, 
And sank ' mid the tempest's loud roar. 
The captain asleep and the men off their posts, 
With the coal and provisions run short, 
While the doomed ones they hoped for that bright western 
land, 
Which in joyous sweet dreams they had sought. 
Cnoaus. 
Can it be such neglect shall by us be forgot, 
Or that money shall triumph once more, 
%. good willing hand, a 
stout branch awl a 
rope, 
'or those who go back on the poor. 
When the divers went down ' neath the wreck to search 
For the victims that lay far below, 
"'Tis only a 
steerage " Was oft the remark, 
As the ghastly form came up to view. 
As if only a 
steerage could shut out a 
soul, 
Because poverty claimed him her own. 
As if dollars and dimes are the standard of worth. 
And the pass to all good that is known. 
Cnours. 
But the White Star must change its emblem aloft, 
To blood-red, a-float and ashore, 
Till the steamer Atlantic's forgotten by time, 
With its cargo of unburied poor. 
At the stands on the corner of every street, 
The aged and the blind used to be, 
And work out a 
living to save them from want, 
From the poor-house that they might be free. 
But now stout Italians, healthy and strong, 
Each old grandmother's driven away, 
I 
don't think the people will stand the base wrong, 
Of these people who work under pay. 
Citonus. 
And the newsboy or bootblack that toils morn and night, 
To keep hunger and pain from the door, 
Have been pushed to the wall by these great organ men, 
Let us never go back on the poor.

What ? no ! it cannot be that they've driven 
Their father, so helpless and old, 
(Oh, God, may their crime be forgiven,) 
To perish out here in the cold. 
Oh Heavens, he is sadden'd and weary, 
See the tears how they course down his ...leeks! 
Oh, this world it is lonely and dreary, 
And his heart for relief vainly seeks. 
CHORES. 
For he's old and helpless, and feeble, 
The days of his youth have gone by; 
Then over the hill to the poor hou9e, 
He wanders alone there to die. 
Al me! on that old doorstep yonder, 
I've sat with my babes on my knee, 
No father was happier or fonder 
Than I 
of my little ones three. 
The boys both so rosy and chubby, 
And Lily with prattle so sweets 
God knows how their father has loved them. 
But theyy've driven him out in the street. 
For he's old, &a, 
It's long years since my isiary was taken, 
My faithful, affectionate wife; 
*nee then I'm forlorn and forsaken, 
and the light has died out of my life. 
The. boys grew to manhood; he gave them 
A 
need for the farm! aye, and more, 
He ga're them this house they we're born in! 
And rw 
he's turn'd Out from its door. 
For he's old, &c. 
Oh, children! loved children! yet hear me, 
I 
have jurneyed along on life's stage; 
With the 'impe that you all would be near me, 
To comfeet and cheer my old age: 
tqy life-blo,-1 I'd gladly have given, 
To shield ..nd protect you ! but hark! 
Though m3. heart breaks, I'll say it's you've driven 
Me out hse to die in the dark. 
For he's old, &c. 
But, perhaps, they'll live happter without me; 
Farewell, d.ar old home, ah! farewell ! 
each pathway and tree here about me, 
Some memory precious can tell: 
Well! the flowers will bloom bright as ever, 
And the birds sing as sweet to the morn ; 
Then over the hill from the poor house, 
Next Spring the old man, shall be borne. 
For he's old

And cry all night,

There was castor-oil, and soothing syrup, 
And paregoric to, 
Was give to the child when she had fits, 
But nothing would bring her to;

And then she'd lay her in my arms, 
And this to me would say—

And we never more would roam.

In bondage, grief and pain. -

Uncle Sam he was once at a 
festive affair, 
And they called upon Sam for a 
strain, 
So he put out his weed, and toss'd off his glase, 
And then he commenced this refrain : 
I'll sing of " Our Boys" who have made a 
great name 
Their is Captain Bogardus, said he, 
In Europe he showed them how well we could shoot. 
His equal you will seldom see. 
CHORUS. 
He is one of " Our Boys," he is; 
And we are proud of " Our Boys," we are; 
If he is honest and true, we give him his due; 
We are proud of " Our Boys," Hurrah! 
We have got a 
very good Rifle Team, 
They cross'd the wide ocean, you know, 
And defeated the Dollymount marksmen with ease, 
And won all the prizes, that's so! 
They've defeated, since then, the Canadian Team, 
And although they don't make a 
great noise, 
They could easily beat any marksmen on earth— 
Gildersleeve and his bonny brave boys. 
They belong to " Our Boys," they do, &c.

When Old Johnny Bull had Livingstone lost, 
And given him up in despair, 
It was one of " Our Boys,"—:Tim Bennett, who said— 
For the Doctor I'll now have a 
care. 
It was one of " Our Boys," and a 
plucky one, too, 
Who went out and Livingstone found; 
All honor to Stanley! may courage like his 
Be always successfully crowned. 
He is one of " Our Boys," &c. 
But chief on the blazing scroll of fame, 
Is one we must never forget ; 
He founded this nation, the pride of creation, 
And astonished the world you may bet! 
George Washington's name by all is revered, 
So fill up each cup and each can, 
And we'll make the roof ring, as we shout and we sing, 
For George was a 
mighty good man. 
CHonts. 
He was chief of " Our Boys," he was; 
And we are proud of " Our Boys," we are; 
Xle was honest and true, so give him his due; 
We are proud of " Our Boys," we are.

As sung by AIME BENNETr. 
(These were the last words of " Americus," the well-known child 
violinist, seven years of age, who expired very suddenly during the 
night of January 10th, 1874, in Boston. 
So quietly did his spirit 
take its flight that his father. who occupied the same room, although 
hearing his son make the foregoing exclamation, thought the boy 
was talking in his sleep, and was horrified to find the little child 
cold in death, in the morning.)

Radiant with holy joy, 
As if angels came to whisper 
Tidings to our little boy.

And we heard our darling murmur, 
As the brightness lit his face, 
"Please God, make me room in Heaven, 
Make your little boy a

Good-night, father !" said our darling, 
As he sank to sweet repose ; 
Like a 
bird, his gleeful music 
Died away at twilight's close. 
" 
Good-night, father !" &e. - 
He was weary of the struggle, 
Discords jarred upon his soul; 
And his gentle spirit left us, 
Wafted to the heavenly goal ; 
He has room among the angels, 
He is freed from sin and care: 
God, who watcheth e'en the sparrow, 
Answer'd little Jinamie's prayer.

But oh! the gawk-eyed, blue wash cur, 
His scalp I'd like to pull, 
If I 
had him in the 14th ward, 
I'd carve old sitting bull. 
Our country lost a 
patriot, 
Brave Custer we will moan, 
His memory will live forever green, 
When you and I 
are gone. 
He fought against overwhelming odds, 
Laid many an Indian low, 
And when brave Custer met his death, 
Our country met a 
blow. 
CHORUS. 
But oh, dat red- skin ingin cu, 
We're bound to take his wool, 
And to avenge gallant Custer's death, 
We'll scalp old Sitting Bull.

The Book or Beauty, Vigor and Eleganee.-"1 
With the Science and Art of Dressing with Taste. Personal beauty al. 
ways has and always will exert a 
powerful influence upon the destinies 
of the world. Every individual is affected more or less by its power. It

pearing to the best advantage, whether in person or dress, this book par.

these defects, and in nearly all cases to become, if not absolutely fasci-
nating, to become beautiful, elegant and graceful, and to be admired and 
sought after by the opposite sex. 
To those to whom Nature has been

The N. Y. Evening 
writes: 4 
" 
A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. Flamm's, 98 Nas-
sau street ca led the 
Little Flirt." We cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining " how. when and 
'where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. .?. Eeening Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a 
neat little 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. J. FISHER, No. 98 Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might af-
ford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recom-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."

Sparring.—Or the Theory and. Practice of the Art of Self 
Defense. By L. HILDERBRIOND. 
Illustrated by engravings accompa-
nied by instructions of value to the novice or proficient. The subject 
is divided into three parts. The first includes the principles and prac-
tice of the school of sparring, with remarks on the set-to. The seeond 
consists of means of attack and defence of a more difficult nature to 
make an accomplished sparrer, and a 
description of a 
set-to. 
The third 
includes wrestling and training; attacks that may be expected from 
rough or unskilled persons, and methods of avoiding the same; re-
marks on gymnastic exercises, &c.

tematic and simple manner, which will impait a 
good foundation of 
knowledge on the subject, so that by practising the rules one may attain 
to the utmost perfection. The book is written as the scholer should 
progress, and those parts to which special attention is directed should 
be practised thoroughly, the advantage of which will become apparent 
in the subsequen lessons, in whicn will be found everything necessary 
to make a

American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is the old-

These Cards are arranged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs Dia-

into K 4r King, Q for Queen, 
and K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-

standing. Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want fiequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
merit. 
As a 
result of this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved,,, 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the ‘..„ 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
