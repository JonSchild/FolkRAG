 John Bishop:  We’re on the road again. 
James Jones:  Okay. 
Joe Mosnier:  Mr. Jones, I want to ask about [clears throat] a couple of things, thinking 
about [clears throat] being together with other people doing this intense work. 
JJ:  Umm. 
JM:  One is the – your reflections and perspective on being with people in such intense 
circumstances, the relationships, the human dynamics of that kind of experience. 
JJ:  Umm. 
JM:  And also the interracial aspect of that – 
JJ:  Um-hmm. 
JM:  In your specific circumstances there in Pine Bluff, and then in SNCC Arkansas, 
because of what will come to happen.

JJ:  Um-hmm.  The, um, the involvement, the interracial involvement, made everything 
more difficult on the white side and the black side.  On, on the black side, there was a lot of 
growing resentment toward whites being involved, because they were being perceived as the lead 
part, not black folks themselves, though that was not the case, but that’s what they saw and they 
saw a lot of that through Bill Hansen.  Um, when we would go to the, um, uh, meetings – like 
we’d have meetings, mass meetings, and trying to recruit people in the neighborhood or trying to 
get something started – we specifically made an effort for me to launch it.  Because when the 
whites would, um, try and launch it, it would just kind of die dead, no response, and it always 
would be a thing where the black folk want to hear my answers on that.  So, that really stalled 
meetings and efforts to strategize real bad. 
On the, uh, racial – on the racial side, I think, um, there was a hardcore resentment in the 
case of Bill and Ruthie [Buffington].  Interracial marriage right there in Little Rock, I mean right 
there in Arkansas, that was just a no-no.  And I think when things were getting a little quiet 
sometimes, when whites would see that, it would fl back up.  That’s what it’s all about, you 
know.  You know, and so that was a – and then that’s really what generated the – what generated 
the thinking is that we got to officially make Jim Jones the head of this to get rid of that, because 
that’s just too much of a – too much. 
Because when we would go to protest, there was so much focus on the whites, you really 
couldn’t get kind of through to talk about what we were trying to do, uh, because their attitude 
was, “What’s with the white boys?  They don’t need to go – there ain’t no problem with them 
going to a Holiday Inn and stay.  They’re just here to make trouble.”  That’s how they perceived 
it, so that made it more difficult.  And when I took charge of it, I told Bill, “You stay at the office 
James O. Jones Interview, Part 2, 5-25-11 
Page 3 of 22 
 
and coordinate some stuff.  Let us run this thing.”  And then, that made it – the crowd was a lot 
more comfortable.  And I think we were growing in numbers when that move was made, as well. 
JM:  When you needed to shift into these [clears throat] more prominent, consistently 
prominent roles, because obviously you had plenty of prominent roles all the way along, but, um 
– and the, and the project director title shifted to you in ’64, how did Hansen – and were there 
implications for your relationship, your working relationship, your personal relationship?  How 
did that go off? 
JJ:  No.  No, that stayed pretty good.  But, uh, but, uh, Hansen was a very aggressive, 
very aggressive person.  And we – and I had to really shut him down a lot of times in situations.  
I said, “Now, there are some places we need to target,” like the voter registration stuff.  And I 
made a specific point, “Forrest City, you know, Helena, West Helena, uh, Marianna – those are 
hardcore [5:00] conservative hate areas, because all that part of Arkansas is where all them big 
plantations was.”  And I said, “And we’ve got to be careful, because I think there are some of 
them, as we call them, them good ol’ boys, uh, see me and you – I think, uh, the shot gonna be 
fired at you.” 
And, uh, he didn’t want to do none of that, but, but, but me and Grinage and all of us 
said, “No.  I’m going.”  You know, “There comes a time when, you know, we’ve planted the 
seed and got things going, you know, and we’ve got our little group together, that’s okay.  But 
for you to come out, you know, in a lead capacity over there, that’s too dangerous.  You’re 
endangering too many people.” 
Uh, and he was – he was very, uh – he didn’t want to do that, because, uh, uh, though he 
didn’t say it and never would admit it, he liked that limelight.  [Laughs] He liked it!  [Laughs] 
He liked it but he’d swear he didn’t.  “Yes, you do!  You love reading your name.  You love 
James O. Jones Interview, Part 2, 5-25-11 
Page 4 of 22 
 
getting hit in the head, [laughs] and then run up to a camera and show the blood on you.  That 
ain’t what it’s about.”  And I knew when we went to those places they were going to respond to 
the color of my skin, because it was – all the whites who they knew in those neighborhoods were 
folk they didn’t like.  “And we don’t need you to add to it.” 
And when we, uh – now, and when I got – the first place I went was, uh, Forrest City.  
Now, Forrest City surprisingly responded kind of quickly.  And I think it had to do with, uh, uh, 
Mrs. Clay.  She owned a funeral home and she had a big old house.  And she said, “Y’all come 
and take that house.  You can stay there.”  And then, she had a sister or a cousin who was a 
principal, and I think she had that, the professional folks, you know, around her.  And when we 
went – we went to her house, and she called them all over there. 
And we told them what – I said, “No, we’re not trying to integrate, uh, something here in 
Forrest City.  But it’s such a huge base” – that part of Arkansas is ninety percent black – “and the 
voting over here is zero.”  And so, I think that issue was a little easier than cracking the 
restaurants and going to the jail.  But, uh – no, no, no, there were – there were some issues there, 
and I think the issue had to do with, uh, uh, Bill didn’t want to relinquish his role.  But we kind 
of got through it, but that was – we had to get tough with him.  “No!  Stay here!”  We had to do 
it that way. 
JM:  Yeah. 
JJ:  Yeah. 
JM:  I’m going to ask more about the voting work and registration work and other parts 
of the program in the Delta, but let me first ask: How did you – did you go to Atlanta 
occasionally?  Did folks come from Atlanta from SNCC to – how did the relationship with the 
national folks work out? 
James O. Jones Interview, Part 2, 5-25-11 
Page 5 of 22 
 
JJ:  Most of it, most of it was I would take trips down there, and they would have those 
we called, uh, coordinating meetings.  And that’s where all the different states that was involved, 
had all these SNCC people, we would come there and we would exchange thoughts and ideas: 
What are you doing here, how did you overcome that, and a lot of that.  So, I got a good feel, a 
good feel for it. 
But, uh, one of the things that I felt differently about was I thought I had a better feel for 
people in Arkansas because I had a farm background.  A lot of the folk back in those days 
somewhere were farm-connected.  And when I got to Atlanta and would go down there, all them 
boys were big-city boys, and they would just be sitting up articulating.  And, uh, in order to say, 
“We’re going to go, uh, down the road to a store,” it’d take them three hours, because they had 
these educated kids, and they was articulating what they know and all the big words, and I’d just 
be sitting there, saying “What are they – what are y’all doing?” 
It was – [10:00] I saw a lot of showing off their education and not a good feel for the 
neighborhood.  That never was part of the – and when they, uh – and when they would ask me to 
make comments, I would talk very specific about the level of folks I was dealing with, and what 
the issues there, and that I don’t think that’s going to happen until blah-blah-blah-blah.  And so, 
old Jim Forman told me one time, he said, he said, “Jones, what you are doing is a real direct 
connection to the community.  That’s a wonderful thing.” 
And he said, and he asked me, he said, “Do you want, uh – do you want us to send some 
people?”  But I said, “Well, not really, but I tell you what I would like to do.  There is – you’ve 
got a group down there that’s a great singing group.  Send that group up here to one of those 
meetings I have, because I have a lot of people, and they’re church folks.  They’ll love that!”  
James O. Jones Interview, Part 2, 5-25-11 
Page 6 of 22 
 
And I said, “And let’s slowly graduate.”  But those guys, you know, when they came and saw 
that big crowd, all they wanted to do was sing, have a good time, and went on back.  [Laughs] 
But, uh – but what I was doing was, uh, asking people, uh, to put your shoes on and let’s 
go knock on some doors and try to get people to vote.  And then, I said also, I told Mrs. Clay, 
“Mrs. Clay, we need some – a couple of folks to run for something, but they need to be educated, 
they need to be highly respected.”  And then, she told me that, uh, this guy that was – they had a 
little plant in Forrest City.  I think it was a garment factory.  She said, “Well, that guy over there, 
he’s been promoted to manager.”  I said, “Let’s run him.”  And we did, and – but it wasn’t like 
the mayor or nothing, but it was a position – and he won. 
And folks said, “I never thought it was going to happen.”  I said, “Well, you do have to 
make an effort to make it happen.”  And he went on and did real well.  And I said, “And that’s 
what – that’s the kind of stuff we need to do as well as, uh,” I said, “You know, we don’t have 
to, we don’t have to go into a white restaurant and eat.”  [Laughs] So, if somebody do want to do 
that, you know, uh, they can.  You know, so, uh, so that’s, that’s – that’s the direction I went. 
JM:  Yeah.  The SNCC program seemed to have those three big thrusts: [clears throat] 
public accommodations, where you could do that; then, uh, the whole voter registration and 
starting to run people in electoral campaigns; and, um, education, too – you were talking about 
the schools question, too.  Um, I’ve read that the – I’ve seen the numbers for what the SNCC 
program accomplished in short order, I mean, in pretty darn short order – 
JJ:  Oh, yeah. 
JM:  Twenty-four months, less than that, depending on what number you’re looking at.  
Um, more people signing up despite the poll tax still persisting; a lot of candidates get into races. 
JJ:  Right.  Exactly.  
James O. Jones Interview, Part 2, 5-25-11 
Page 7 of 22 
 
JM:  There’s the ’66 governor’s race outcome, which is a curious thing, because of the 
black vote. 
JJ:  Um-hmm, um-hmm. [Steady sound tone begins]    
[Recording stops and then resumes] 
JB:  We’re rolling. 
JM:  Okay, we’re back on after a short break for equipment.  Uh, Mr. Jones, we were 
starting to talk about the program, the SNCC program, the work out there, and the voting work, 
getting people into races, and let me just turn it over to you. 
JJ:  Now, in some cases, folks fell short in vision, because there were individuals who 
“public accommodation” was all they had in their head.  And, you know, once you integrate or 
desegregate, and all the restaurants has opened their doors, and you can go in the, uh, uh, go into 
town and get you a room, to me, that’s finished.  But we had some folks who, you know, looked 
long distance, “Well, let’s go – let’s go to Chicago and protest!”  [Laughs] That’s an example, 
because that was the onliest focus they had.  And – and those are the folks, uh, were in Arkansas.  
I said, “No.  You know, no, that – we need to – this population needs to, you know, access voting 
and start running candidates, you know.”  And that was a new, new piece to it.  But some folks 
were stuck. 
JM:  Um-hmm. 
JJ:  I mean, they were stuck and couldn’t get off that. 
JM:  Yeah.  Describe a [15:00] – the, the, your experience across a [clears throat], a 
representative week, doing voter registration work in the Delta, fall of ’63, early ’64.  What 
happens to you in that week?  And who do you see, and what’s it like, and how’s it feel? 
James O. Jones Interview, Part 2, 5-25-11 
Page 8 of 22 
 
JJ:  When – my approach to it is, in every community, almost every community, there is 
that woman, and in most cases, it was women, and, uh, I learned that from – that lady’s name 
was Derworth, in Gould, [Arkansas], Mrs. Derworth.  And she said, “Young man, when you go 
into a neighborhood, um, for the first time, if there’s a black barbershop there, go in there.”  I 
said, “Okay.”  “And you ask for specific type people: ‘I’m looking for somebody that’s, um, 
that’s interested in politics, or knows some good people that could run for office, or they have a 
lot of influence.’”  She said, “Those gossiping men in them barbershops know that stuff!” 
So, when I went to Forrest City, I took that advice.  And, uh, I pulled up, and there was 
about four or five guys out there.  You know, I think these were working people on a break.  And 
I said, “I’m –” introduced myself.  And I didn’t say I was SNCC.  I said, “I’m part of a program, 
and we’re trying to encourage, uh, black folks to vote more.  And, and, even better than that, we 
would like to see more black folks run for office.”  And when I said that, the first thing came – 
like, all three of them said the same thing: “You need to go talk to Mrs. Clay.”  I said, “Now, 
who is Mrs. Clay?”  “She owns the funeral home.  Her husband died, but she, she, she made an 
even bigger funeral home.  That’s who you need to talk to.” 
And, uh, so, I have a little Volkswagen.  I said, “Well, how do I get there?”  “Well, come 
on.  Follow me!”  They like actually introduced me to her!  And she was raring – she was raring 
to go!  She said, “Young man, I’m just glad to see you.  It’s long overdue!”  She was all excited!  
And, uh, she said, “I told my sister –”  I said, “What’s your sister?”  She said, “She’s the 
principal over there, and just the two of us talk all the time.”  She got on that phone and dialed 
her up. 
And, uh, and she said, “How you want to do it?” 
James O. Jones Interview, Part 2, 5-25-11 
Page 9 of 22 
 
I said, uh, I said, “First of all, uh, I need a place to stay.  I probably need to stay two or 
three days.”  She said, “See that house right there?  See that house right there?  See that house 
right there?”  I said, “Yeah.”  “All them are my house.  Which one you want?”  [Laughing] I 
said, “I just need somewhere to sleep.”  [Someone coughs] And, uh, man, she was there fixing 
people up, and her sister came over.  And she said, told about this preacher.  She said, “He’s a 
very aggressive preacher, but he’s by himself.”  Went over there, and I said, “Well, we need to 
have a meeting.”  And those two women said, “We’ll do the calling.  You just go on over there.”  
I don’t know who all they called, but they had a church packed that night.  And then, that’s when 
this guy’s name came up.  He was there.  They said, “You know everybody.  And all the working 
folks here – if all of them just vote for him he going to win.”  [Laughs] And that’s how they got 
started.  So, that seed was there, but it was just sitting still, you know. 
And then, that’s when I started – uh, I said – I made a point to go back there later on, and 
I said, “I followed your advice.”  She said, “In every community, there’s that type person.”  And 
then when I went to other places, you know, I was always looking for that type.  And I got to 
West Helena, that little lady over there – I can’t think of these names anymore – she had a, she 
had a store, run a little store.  And I walked up to her and introduced myself and I said that, uh, 
what I was doing, and I’m trying to encourage people to vote and, and we are – run for 
candidate.  She said, “I ran two years ago, but I didn’t have no votes, because these folks –.”  She 
said, “I’d love to work with you!”  And she said, “Park your car!”  We took off!  [Laughs] 
So, I don’t know if – she said, “Well, I’m getting kind of old now.  But, uh, my son just 
finished college down at Pine Bluff, and, uh, I’m going to talk to him about running.”  But she 
was able [20:00] to rally those type meetings.  And a few years later, after I’d gone, I learned 
there’s a lot more elected folks started – you know, that, that caught on and took off. 
James O. Jones Interview, Part 2, 5-25-11 
Page 10 of 22 
 
JM:  Um-hmm. 
JJ:  And I said, “Well, I’m –” uh, by then, when I went back through there and learned 
some things, and I met a – I met a – what’s this guy?  He’s an attorney in Little Rock.  What’s 
his name?  I chatted with him.  And he said, “Yeah, some good things have been going down.”  
He worked with – they had a health clinic in Marianna.  And, uh, Bill Clinton appointed him, I 
understand, as a federal judge.  What’s that guy’s name?  Oh, shoot, shoot!  Uh, it’ll come to me.  
And then, he said, “Oh, it’s a lot of good things that’s going on in east Arkansas, I mean east 
Arkansas.”  And then that’s where I – I stayed in that circle until I left, you know, because I 
didn’t want to just be “accommodations,” because I thought we had gotten past that a little bit. 
JM:  Yeah, yeah.  Public accommodations.  Yeah.  Before we turn to some of the reasons 
that you departed in ’65 and moved to Atlanta, um, what was your mood?  What was your sense 
of relative gains, challenges not met?  How were you feeling about your work out there in those, 
from the fall of ’63 onward? 
JJ:  Well, you know, I felt good, because, uh, I have a personality of incredible tolerance.  
And when I go out to do things and folks don’t participate or we don’t get it done, I don’t get 
disgusted.  I don’t get mad.  I just say to myself, “Well, we can’t win them all.”  And I’ve always 
been that type of person.  But I also learned is, uh, [phone rings] um, my personality has helped 
me a lot.  [Phone rings] You know, I don’t get mad with folks.  I don’t pick and choose, and I 
can take it.  You dog me, talk about me, and it doesn’t bother me at all.  And so, I don’t see it as 
a failure.  You know, sometimes I’ve said, you know, I wish we could have done or could have 
gotten a bigger role of folks participating, but it doesn’t bother me, uh, that it didn’t. 
And I’m real – I’m very realistic about things.  Um, I have never put my eyes on – when I 
look at doing things, I work at it hard and very diligent, but if it’s – if fifteen people step up and 
James O. Jones Interview, Part 2, 5-25-11 
Page 11 of 22 
 
really work at getting it done, some folks – it’s just like in church, some folks, um, you can get a 
lot done.  But some folks think if you can’t get seventy-five people to help you, it’s a failure.  I 
say, “No, seventy-five, seventy-five people will be a problem for you.  [Laughs] So, let’s get a 
small group that’s got high energy, ready to go.”  And that’s the way I’ve always worked.  And, 
and I think, uh, because I’ve, uh, I always could recruit people and identify, folks took off and 
did a lot of things. 
I remember I was in, uh, Georgia, um, and I went to a little town.  What was that town 
called?  And I went down to this little town, and this was, uh – 
JM:  When you went? 
JJ:  Yeah. 
JM:  When you worked on the Sharecroppers Fund? 
JJ:  Um-hmm. 
JM:  Yeah. 
JJ:  And I went to this town, and there was a little town where they had a little factory, 
and they had left town, and everybody was unemployed.  So, when I got there, I said, “Well –,” 
[clears throat] I went and met with this schoolteacher.  She was a very prominent woman in the 
neighborhood, and I said, “Well, I’d like to have a little meeting.”  She said, “I can get the people 
to come out.” 
And when they all came out [laughs] to the meeting – this is a big meeting – they have 
this big warehouse sitting there.  I said, “Wow, that’s a big warehouse,” and it was shut down.  
So, I said, “Well, what would, uh – [25:00] any thoughts about what you would like to do?”  
Everybody in this building had these big thoughts of – like building a seventy-five story, uh, 
high-rise building, and all kind of wild stuff.  
James O. Jones Interview, Part 2, 5-25-11 
Page 12 of 22 
 
And I said, “Can I make a comment on something I see with my eyes?”  “Yes, go ahead.”  
I said, “If a plant comes here, and y’all get a chance to go to work,” I said, “I see so many babies, 
so many kids, I don’t think nobody in this room could go to work!”  [Laughing] So, they all 
started laughing and they said, “Mr. Jones, you’re right!”  [Laughs] For you to go to work you’ve 
got to have somewhere to leave – you’ve got five or six kids?!  I said, “One thing I would 
suggest is y’all need to consider a nursery to keep kids.”  I mean, that town was saturated with 
little kids.  I’m thinking everybody had five kids, six, ten! 
And this lady said, “My brother,” and that big warehouse?  That was her brother’s 
warehouse.  She said, “My brother’s got a big warehouse.”  But she said, “He is such a hustler, 
he ain’t going to let you have that.”  I said, “What kind of hustler?”  She said, “He’s a big-time 
gambler, and he loves money.  He ain’t gonna do nothing.”  So, I said, “Let me – I’d like to, uh, 
meet him.”  She said, “I’ll call him.” 
So, he came to the meeting, fifty-five-year-old kind of guy, maybe sixty.  I said, “Sir, in 
order for this town to even think about going to work –” there was some other work in their little 
town, but they couldn’t go to work with nobody to take care of the kids – I said, “We – if we 
could build a nursing home {Jones likely means nursery] here for these kids to be taken care of, I 
think a lot of – most of these women here could find work.”  He said, “You think so?”  I said, “I 
think so.”  Because, see, I’d already talked to this, this, this, uh, uh, this, um, big, uh, Army, uh, 
uh, Roberts, some place [Warren Robins Air Force Base].  It’s a big, big, big military, and they 
were hiring a lot of people, and it was common labor. 
JM:  Um-hmm. 
JJ:  So, I said, “And that’s your warehouse?”  He said, “Yeah.”  I said, “That big 
warehouse could be turned into –” I said, “What you going do with it?”  He said, “I ain’t going 
James O. Jones Interview, Part 2, 5-25-11 
Page 13 of 22 
 
do nothing with it.”  I said, “We could turn that big warehouse into, uh, one heck of a nursery, 
and these folk would have a place to keep these kids, and they could go to work.”  He said, 
“Well, Mr. Jones, if you could get, get that, get it renewed, and it needs a lot of work on it, I’ll 
give it to the group.”  [Laughs] He said, “I’ll give it to the group.”  That’s what he said. 
I said, “Ladies, we got work to do.”  They said, “What we got to do?”  I said, “Me and all 
of y’all are going over there, and we’re going to tear that whole house out, tear all that wall 
down, and we’re going to put all that board out there on the street, and we’re going to call the 
city and tell them to come pick it up.”  And I said, “Y’all ready to do that?”  “You gonna make 
us do that?”  “Yes ma’am, all you – every woman in town.”  They showed up! 
And the thing that was so beautiful about this – when the – there was a big lumber 
company in this next town.  And this guy had taken some lumber somewhere, and he came by, 
and all these women – pow, pow!  And that guy, he said, “Come here, son.  You, uh, you’re the 
onliest man I see.  What – are you in charge of this?”  I said, “Yes sir.  I told those women we 
want to tear down this place, rip out the inside, and we’re going to turn it into a nursery, so all 
these women with all [30:00] these babies can go to work.”  That guy said, “Down there at the, 
uh –,” he said, “Down there at the, at the, um, at the – what?”  Some Robert, some Robert, but 
it’s a big, um, um, Navy – 
JM:  Military, yeah. 
JJ:  Navy base or something like that.  He said, “Man, they would love to have these 
women come down there, because they’re way short.”  He said, “You got any money to pay –?”  
I said, “No, um-um.  We – it’s just sweat and blood!”  He said, “Let me go talk to my boss.”  
Warner Roberts [Robins] – that’s the name of the place! 
JM:  Yeah! 
James O. Jones Interview, Part 2, 5-25-11 
Page 14 of 22 
 
JJ:  Yeah, that’s the name of the place!  This, uh, this guy went down there, and it was 
about five-thirty he came back.  He said, “You know what?  I’ve got some good news.”  He said, 
“If them women going to do all that building,” he told me, said, “All that lumber out there,” he 
said, “It’s been a little rained on, but it’s still good.  You just – you take it up there.” 
Man!  Them women built that thing, and the guy who owned it he came up there.  He 
said, “Man, are you God-sent?  Or you ain’t Jesus Christ, are you?  [Laughing] How did you get 
them women to do all that work?”  [Laughs] I said, “They’re doing it for themselves.”  And we 
got this huge – man, that thing, that thing was about two blocks, three blocks in size. 
And so, this one lady said, “Can’t you get federal money?”  I said, “Let me tell you about 
that.  No, you don’t want that.  If we get federal money for this, the federal government will 
make you put square feet per child.  You won’t get a third of them kids in that building.  But if 
you’re private, like you are – you own it – you can stack them in like sardines.  [Laughs] And all 
of y’all that’s not working, don’t get a job, you come down here, and y’all become the group that 
take care of all these babies.  And all of y’all that get a job, y’all start giving them a few dollars 
for taking care of these kids.”  Just like that, man, that thing just took off! 
JM:  That’s great. 
JJ:  Just took off. 
JM:  Yeah. 
JJ:  And, uh, and long after I left, I would get little cards from folks saying, “This works 
so well, and we would love to see you come back and visit.”  That’s been years ago. 
JM:  Wow. 
JJ:  You know, and it’s always just – you know, I’ve just kind of been a little gifted on 
that side – 
James O. Jones Interview, Part 2, 5-25-11

JM:  Yeah, yeah. 
JJ:  Just seeing things and just – 
JM:  Sure. 
JJ:  And believe that folks can do it pretty good themselves, you know, so. 
JM:  Let’s talk a little bit, as we kind of move towards our last section of the interview, 
um, to talk about some of the reasons, some of the things that were happening in SNCC 
nationally, how they reverberated in Arkansas, some of the things that happened in Arkansas, 
and then how you made your transition over. 
JJ:  Um-hmm. 
JM:  Um, we’ve talked earlier about ’64: The directorship passes formally into your 
hands.  You’ve talked about Bill Hansen.  There are other whites that had come in and were 
coming in in that time, so the – I think the SNCC [clears throat], excuse me, the SNCC staff ’64, 
’65ish in Arkansas would have been about eight people fulltime, sort of, uh, full staffers, and, uh, 
four black, four white.  Um, the tensions are becoming a little more closely felt on the racial 
leadership of the organization question.  ’65 is a pretty hot summer nationally, first riots and all, 
and the whole question of the integrationist model is now being challenged by lots of folks.  
Things aren’t, especially – you know, we’ve talked about economic – difficulties of moving on 
the economic front.  It’s just getting – you know, like you said earlier, some people’s vision went 
to public accommodations.  After you desegregate what then?  How do you finally get to the 
economic justice issue underlying all this stuff? 
So, with all that as kind of prelude, I’m interested in your perspective on, through that 
’64-65 period, how those questions played out inside your life, in SNCC in Arkansas, and how 
you – the circumstances that led to your move to move away. 
James O. Jones Interview, Part 2, 5-25-11 
Page 16 of 22 
 
JJ:  Well, you know, my moving away, and, is – was, um, what I saw and what I felt was 
the resources and the use of people was, uh, dwindling.  And a lot of the folks who had that 
energy early was beginning to drift toward going to work to make a living.  People were getting 
older.  The SNCC [35:00] group was young and high-energy and educated, and this whole 
Movement was a fun thing.  And a lot of folk was not recognizing we’re getting older, we’re 
becoming family folks, resources are dwindling, and that was a natural thing to me.  But a lot of 
the white kids who have come down wanted that to be a lifetime situation.  But what we were 
dealing with was not lifetime.  Uh, a lot of the kids that we had worked with that we saw do 
wonderful things in SNCC and all of that – they, too, had hit college level and gone on. 
And when me and my wife – and I said this to Bill Hansen and all them, “Look, guys, 
this, this – we have done a pretty good job.  And we’re going to ruin it if we keep stretching it 
and stretching it, and we ain’t doing nothing.  There’s no means of income.”  And that’s when 
folks started peeling off, because I think the Black Panthers and Stokely [Carmichael] and all 
that, they saw that Movement dwindling, too, and they were trying to rebuild them some little 
new, new, uh, new things and get it going, since this has kind of ended. 
And then, I think – to me, I think SNCC sort of, uh, went as far as its capabilities.  And 
we had to recognize that we got older and needed jobs to support families, and we had seen black 
elected officials come in, and I thought that was, that was very successful.  But there were a lot 
of folks – and, you know, there still are, still people who think we still should be doing that.  No, 
uh-uh.  It’s not the same.  It’s changed.  People have changed.  No.  Yeah, there are conditions 
all around, but it does not fit – I don’t think it fits a SNCC-type activity that we were doing.  I 
think we did pretty good fueling folks’ growth, but, uh, I don’t think we could be a lifetime 
instrument for that.  Yeah.

JM:  You were in Atlanta, but, um – and busy, I’m sure, traveling quite a bit for the 
Sharecroppers Fund, right? 
JJ:  Um-hmm. 
JM:  Yeah.  Um, but in ’66 in the spring, obviously, John Lewis is ousted at SNCC, and 
Stokely Carmichael comes in.  And one last thing I want to ask about kind of what’s – or maybe 
two things – left behind, or things that will happen in Arkansas while you’re now on the East 
Coast.  Um, one is, um, Grinage is – feels compelled to basically make a statement [JB coughs] 
challenging the abandonment of the integrationist model, and Stokely Carmichael actually comes 
to Arkansas and has things to say about Grinage, in fact.  [JB coughs] So, I’m interested in if you 
had a – at the time, you were a long ways away.  I don’t know if you kind of watched that at that 
time or not.  That’s one thing.  The other thing is, um, uh, the emergence in Arkansas, in Little 
Rock anyway, of Bobby Brown and the Black Youth United, and if you bumped up against that 
at all or knew those folks. 
JJ:  I didn’t, you know, uh, bump into it, but, you know, I heard about it and knew what 
was taking place.  I think, uh, the way I perceived that was that was going to be a very small 
faction, and it was going to be very satisfying to Brown and was going to be very satisfying to 
Stokely.  But I don’t think they were focusing on anything that was going to be helpful to people.  
They were on their one-way trip and they were ego-ing on it.  And both of those guys always, 
way back in the early days of SNCC, wanted to be the top gun, but they didn’t have an audience.  
And that’s what that is, and that’s nothing else, you know. 
Uh, I remember [40:00] a long time ago, uh, Stokely was trying to carve out him a group, 
because he wanted to be the next Malcolm X.  And that’s all that was.  He wasn’t focused on 
benefits of trying to make situations better and different.  He just wanted that, you know, that star 
James O. Jones Interview, Part 2, 5-25-11 
Page 18 of 22 
 
in his hat.  And I never was interested in that, you know.  I think you have to sort of try to make 
a difference the best you can, but to go out there on your own and carve you out a little spot, I 
think that’s – to me, that’s a waste of time.  And it’s not going anywhere, you know.  It gets you 
a lot of media and all this kind of stuff, but it’s nothing, it’s nothing else, I don’t think. 
No, I, I was in tune and knew about all of that, but none of that was anything I – when I 
was, uh, with the Sharecroppers, one of the things that, uh, I had to deal with is – that was small 
farmers’ stuff – you always had guys who wanted to go attack the white man, attack FHA 
[Farmers Home Administration], and take their money, and just go find all the black farmers and 
just throw all the money out there to them.  [Steady sound tone begins] I said, “Well, guys, that’s 
wasteful thinking.” 
JM:  Excuse us.  I’m sorry. 
[Recording stops and then resumes] 
[Laughter and small talk] 
JM:  John, should we jump back on here? 
JB:  Yeah, you’re on. 
JM:  Okay.  Alrighty. 
JB:  You’re on now. 
JM:  Okay.  Let me ask about a couple of things here as we wind down.  Um, you want to 
tell an important story about the tensions inside, say, the – your work at Sharecroppers, when the 
people have different ideas about how to go at these problems. 
JJ:  With the Sharecroppers, there are folks who feel they deserve being paid a lot of 
money – no identification of what for, but just to do it.  What my assignment was at 
Sharecroppers was to go identify – in Virginia, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina – small farmers.  
James O. Jones Interview, Part 2, 5-25-11 
Page 19 of 22 
 
And I did not deal with the inside of that mechanism.  I told them I think there were some 
opportunities for them to sell their product and make some money.  That’s the end I worked on.  
And I worked with, uh, national chain stores and the big chain stores.  And I learned in that circle 
most of the stores was looking for black farmers’, small farmers’ products.  Closer, fresher, a lot 
cheaper because of the distance.  And that worked fine; that was kind of easy.  [Laughs] 
But what had some of them blocked is they’re talking about the, uh, money the big 
farmers are making, which was not always true, and shipping it all over the country, and you 
need a lot of volume.  And they were looking over the fact that I got five acres of tomatoes that I 
can harvest four times and I can send it right here to Kroger’s, and Kroger’s will buy it, which is 
an excellent marketing strategy.  They were looking past that.  And that’s the kind of stuff I 
worked with, and they done well. 
Now, some of them ended, but that was because the older population, who was farming, 
their children didn’t want to farm and headed to New York.  Well, it’s time to close that project 
down.  And some folks don’t recognize that, and you have to be straight with them, say, “No, 
you have nobody to run the farm anymore.  Don’t sell your property.  Please don’t sell it, 
because in five or ten years, right here is probably going to be the home of condos, so you’ll 
make plenty of money selling it.”  So, that’s the side I worked on, trying to get them to make 
money. 
JM:  Yeah.  You mentioned earlier on, talking about yourself and how you could go 
through this experience, you said you’re a realist.  You have a kind of a measured sense of 
outcomes.  [45:00] And, uh, being a realist, did you ever have reason to think that, “You know, 
looked at in some ways, progress is much slower than we all would like on some of the basic 
economic questions, that maybe the – maybe there’s another way to do this, maybe with 
James O. Jones Interview, Part 2, 5-25-11 
Page 20 of 22 
 
institutional racism, those kinds of built-in headwinds, that maybe the integrationist model we 
had in mind isn’t quite the right model?”  Anyway, just any second –? 
JJ:  No, I, uh – my thinking was, in the model, I never did see it like a lot of the guys did, 
that, uh, the integration thing was, uh, was the model to go with.  What I did see, though, is a lot 
of the white kids who came in and played roles, I would look very closely at.  Some of them did 
have very, very good contacts, parents in big circles, wealthy.  And when I, what I, um, zeroed in 
on: “Give us some contacts in the Northeast or Ohio, where we can possibly, um, do some 
things.”  Do some things, because some of the folks in the Movement saw – when the whites 
came in, they thought they saw money, and money to be brought and put in the pot.  But I didn’t.  
I always saw them as potential great contacts to make better outlets. 
Uh, for example, I, uh, in Arkansas, one – different kids, I said, “Look, we’ve got some – 
we’ve got these kids, pretty smart.  Why don’t you –” like we had some kids from Boston, New 
York, and D.C. – “why don’t we go to these kids that’s pretty smart and looking to college?  Do 
you in your circle have contact with schools that we might can get scholarships?”  That’s how I 
used them.  I never had this dream to heaven like a lot of people did, uh-uh. 
And I think, I think my background helped me to stay grounded.  You know, my, uh, my 
parents did well in farming, but I saw the grind in it, and I – you know, so, we didn’t have this 
big – [laughs] this big trillion dollar, trillion dollars falling out of the sky.  But I think that helped 
me – grounded.  And I think some of the Movement people didn’t have that kind of, kind of 
grounded background, and a lot of that stuff was theory.  You know, “We should be able to do 
this, we should be able –” and sometimes those theories were dependent on the government 
doing a whole lot of stuff.  But the folks you were working with weren’t ready for that, at that 
level of stuff, so that’s how I –. 
James O. Jones Interview, Part 2, 5-25-11 
Page 21 of 22 
 
And, and I think, uh, in terms of slow things, yeah, I saw slow development.  I saw a lot 
of things didn’t happen.  I, I saw things like, um, efforts to try and get, um, more nurses and 
blacks in nursing, and smaller hospitals in smaller towns, and trying to recruit doctors to come in 
in those areas and spend time – that didn’t happen.  I was hoping – that kind of stuff would have 
made huge dents, because you take east, um, Arkansas, and you’re looking at folk going all the 
way to Little Rock or to Memphis, to the big cities.  And I looked at that, but that didn’t fly.  But 
when it didn’t fly, it wasn’t something that brought me down, you know, so. 
JM:  Final thoughts – any? 
JJ:  I guess, uh, my final thought is my being involved with SNCC was a wonderful thing.  
I saw a lot of growth in people.  I saw a lot of growth in young folks who excelled and went on.  
Uh, I think some people see that because they did well and moved on was disappointment as 
opposed to staying where they were and all that, just that [50:00] geographical change, and you 
can’t blame people for that.  I felt – I feel real good, years later, that I did pretty good [clears 
throat] with putting people together on the marketing end and small farmers.  Uh, [clears throat] I 
think I, uh, feel good about when I left, when I left SNCC, I stayed in the rural kind of, uh, area, 
[clears throat] still working on the behalf of people.  And if you look at my resume, every job 
I’ve had put me in touch with working with a lot of people, and that’s been the joy of my life.  
I’ve just loved it. 
Don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t – [clears throat] probably could have been several other things.  
I wish the fifty thousand black farmers we had identified in the East and the South and the far 
South could have been given some payment toward – the government not allowing them to 
borrow money and all of that.  But a lot of those folks, when a decision was made to recognize 
them, ninety-five percent of those folks was dead and gone, and that level is who should have 
James O. Jones Interview, Part 2, 5-25-11 
Page 22 of 22 
 
been the beneficiary.  And now the sons and the daughters of those folks are in Chicago and 
Detroit and everywhere else.  Um, and if there is, uh, a little bit of compensation given, it needs 
to be very carefully done.  I would not be real excited about John Doe in Chicago now is thirty-
seven years old and does not even know who his granddaddy was that farmed seventy-five years 
ago.  I don’t think, you know, that compensates who did the hard work. 
But I, but I’ve been very pleased with, uh, the direction I went in life.  I’ve pretty much 
been close to agriculture, small towns, all my life, which is what I love doing.  Yeah, so. 
JM:  Mr. Jones, it’s [clears throat] it’s really been an honor and a great privilege.  Thank 
you so much for sitting down with us. 
JJ:  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Glad you came by, and – [laughs]. 
JB:  Yeah, it was really, really nice. 
JJ:  Yeah, yeah.
