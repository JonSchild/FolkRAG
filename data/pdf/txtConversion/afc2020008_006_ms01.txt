Phil Gheller interviewed by Vyta Pivo on May 24, 2021 at the Lehigh Cement Company Plant 
in Nazareth, Pennsylvania. The interview transcript has been edited for clarity.  
 
[00:00:00] 
 
Vyta Pivo: 
So, today is Monday, May 24th, 2021. This is an interview for the occupational 
history archive, which is part of the Folklife Center at the Library of Congress, funded by the 
Archie Greene Fellowship. As part of this project, I'm interviewing cement workers in the 
Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania, the birthplace of the modern cement industry in the United 
States. The recording and transcript will become part of the permanent collection at the Library 
of Congress. I am Vyta Pivo and today I am speaking with Phil Gheller at the Lehigh Cement 
Company Nazareth Plant in Nazareth, Pennsylvania. And just to confirm, you, give me your 
permission to record the interview, is that correct?  
 
Phil Gheller:  Correct.  
 
VP: 
Excellent, thank you. So, could you tell me your full name, year of your birth, and where 
you were born?  
 
PG: 
My name is Phillip Gheller. My birthday is 1986, and I was born in Bethlehem, 
Pennsylvania.  
 
VP: 
And I was just kind of up the street.  
 
PG: 
Yeah, very close. Yup.  
 
VP: 
And you grew up in Bethlehem?  
 
PG: 
No, I grew in the slate belt area, Pen Argyl. I was born in Pen Argyl, I grew up there.  
 
VP: 
What did you first learn about cement and concrete?  
 
PG: 
So, my uncle works at Buzzi, that's the cement plant right down the road, and his son 
got a job there and now his son works. So, there's three generations that worked at the Buzzi 
plant. So, I always kind of grew up with my uncle telling me kind of the whole process and the 
long hours and the conditions and stuff. So, I had an idea what I was getting into. So, yeah. 
 
VP: 
And you heard about it and said, yes, sign me up.  
 
PG: 
Yeah. Just had the opportunity to come here and work. And what I was doing before 
wasn't really what I wanted to do. And yeah, I thought, why not give it a shot? And it's worked 
out, I've been here for four years, so.  
 
VP: 
So, when did you start?  
 
PG: 
September of 2017.  
 
VP: 
And did you go to school to study a related topic?  
2 
 
 
PG: 
No, no. I just came in, I worked construction and I went to a community college. I have 
my associate's degree and but just general studies. So, I don't really have any type of schooling 
for this.  
 
VP: 
Did you work with concrete in construction?  
 
PG: 
No, I did drywall and framing, so, no, not really anything to do with cement.  
 
VP: 
And so, what kind of a job did you start with when you got here?  
 
PG: 
I started as a laborer for a year and then I moved to the quarry for two years and now 
I'm back on the labor department as the lead man.  
 
VP: 
So, can you describe what that work entailed?  
 
[00:02:50] 
 
PG: 
So, as a laborer, you are really just responsible for cleaning piles, jackhammering skits 
steering, just getting the work area ready for maintenance. It could be the electrical department, 
it could be outside contractors and you're just really making the area clean and safe. Yeah, that's 
a laborer job.  
 
VP: 
So, how many laborers are there at work right now?  
 
PG: 
We have four.  
 
VP: 
Just four.  
 
PG: 
Yeah. When I started there were sixteen so. Yeah, it's been cut down pretty much. It's 
pretty tough. 
 
VP: 
Is that because something happened at the plant? 
 
PG: 
 There's it's kind of a trickle down with retirement and other people bidding onto jobs. 
So, you start when you get hired here, unless you get hired onto a job, you start as a laborer, 
you hired you’re a laborer, then you can move on. You can move on the next day if you want, 
you can bid, but you start as a laborer. So, we're just, a lot of guys are retiring. So, all our 
younger guys, we're back filling the jobs and we're just kind of left with four guys right now. 
But they told me they're hiring more, so.  
 
VP: 
And so, how many years do people typically work in that position?  
 
PG: 
It's pretty … um, I worked eight months and I think that was pretty long. It's normally 
very fast. I would say within four to six months you normally move on.  
 
VP: 
And so, I guess it's a way for you to get it know what happens at the plant.  
 
[00:04:19] 
 
3 
 
PG: 
Sure, yeah. You really, as a laborer, you get to see every nook and cranny. You know, 
you get to, some days you get to help out other departments if they need you, you know. So, 
yeah, you get to learn a lot because out in the plant, everything's numbered. There's numbers 
for locations. So, all our bell systems, it's all numbers. And you get to learn it by working on 
the labor department.  
 
VP: 
How many numbers are there?  
 
PG: 
I believe there's 600.  
 
VP: 
That's a lot of. 
 
PG: 
Yeah. 
 
VP: 
And so, they get some sort of training, I imagine. 
 
PG: 
Yeah, as a laborer, that's kind of what I'm like, the lead man. Like, when they come in, 
they're kind of my tails for about a month and a half where they get cross-trained on equipment 
and it's dangerous out there, it's very dangerous. You have to be careful. So, I just have to kind 
of watch over them for a little while until they're comfortable and then they move on.  
 
VP: 
So, what does a typical day look like for that position?  
 
[00:05:17] 
 
PG: 
Well, we start we work six to two-thirty Monday to Friday. Labor position is just 
Monday to Friday. So, we come at six. I go up to my bosses, I get our orders, you know what's 
getting done for the day. And then there's not many of us. Normally, we'll break up into twos. 
Sometimes you go by yourself. Sometimes if it's a big job, we all go out together, we go to the 
job, you start working on it, and we start at six, most start at seven. So, we get a little bit of 
head start to start prepping the area so that when they come in, it's at least ready for them to 
inspect what they have to do. And yeah, that's pretty much our day. A lot of overtime, a lot of 
overtime. We get a lot of call outs on the labor department. So, you know, we leave at two-
thirty. It's not rare for us to get called back at six if we want to come back and problem happens 
and stuff like that.  
 
VP: 
So, it's the cleaning is in preparation for work and also when something happens.  
 
PG: 
Yeah, yeah. There could be, you know, belts rip, elevators break. It's an old plant, stuff 
breaks a lot. It's beat up, you know, it's worked pretty hard. So yeah, there's always something 
breaking. Always.  
 
VP: 
So, how many hours do people typically work per week?  
 
PG: 
I would say, on my average, I work 65 hours a week.  
 
VP: 
Yeah, that's a lot. Do people get burned out?  
 
4 
 
PG: 
Yeah, you get tired, but here it's, I mean, you can deny overtime. You can just, you 
know, not answer your phone. It's not a problem. But, you know, you can make a lot of money, 
too.  
 
VP: 
So, it's not a salary position, it's an hourly position.  
 
PG: 
Yep.  
 
VP: 
What do you think is the hardest part of the job?  
 
[00:07:09] 
 
PG: 
The conditions, because, I mean, it's hot. The kiln’s hot, all our machines, the material 
comes out hot. So, in the summertime when it's hot, it's also hot around the equipment. In the 
wintertime, it's cold. You know, you work with your hands, you're out in the cold. I would say 
the conditions.  
 
VP: 
You mentioned it's kind of dangerous. Do people get hurt?  
 
PG: 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's, since I've been here, about a year ago, maybe two years ago, 
a young laborer lost his leg. Yeah. So, you can, yeah.  
 
VP: 
What kind of an accident was that?  
 
PG: 
His leg went into a moving screw and yeah. That was over at plant three. So, we have 
the four different facilities here. Yeah. Yeah, you can get here pretty easy. And you know I've 
heard stories and some bad ones. 
 
VP: 
And workers take that, you have to be very alert.  
 
PG: 
Oh yeah. Yeah. We look out for each other for sure. Yeah. Because I mean a lot of these 
guys like, I'm not on a swing shift. I was when I was in the quarry, that's the rotating shifts. 
And after you know, you work eight in a row, 12 hours, it's tough. Your brain turns to much 
sometimes and you have to be really careful.  
 
VP: 
Yeah. What was the work at the quarry like? Because that's such a different...  
 
[00:08:28] 
 
PG: 
Yeah, that was different, I’ll admit. So, I was the ground guy over there, so it was kind 
of like you run a haul truck, big 50-ton haul truck. But then as a grown man I was also 
responsible for the pumps. So, like, because the quarries, they naturally want to fill up with 
water and we pump them out with big pumps. So, you were in charge of that, fueling them and 
breaking them down and moving them if you had to. And also, you're responsible for the belt 
line system. So, if there's chokes and stuff like that, you're responsible, go unchoke them and 
stuff like that.  
 
VP: 
And is that true, animals get stuck in the belts?  
 
5 
 
PG: 
Um, I've never had, I've never seen an animal get stuck. I've seen actually like, you 
know, down in the quarry you wouldn't think, but there was a tree one time stuck in our system. 
Yeah. So, they must dig out of a high wall and somehow it was a shrub in and it went through 
our system and choked one of our chutes. That was a, you know, that was a headache. It's 
probably a 15-foot tree, but I've never seen an animal, never seen an animal.  
 
VP: 
How many people work at the quarry?  
 
PG: 
It's three crews of six guys.  
 
VP: 
And they, can you talk a little bit about the rotating schedule?  
 
PG: 
Sure. So, the quarry is different. That's only a first and second shift. And you do one 
overnight. So, you work eight on, two off, seven on, four off. So, it's a three-week rotation and 
you're one overnight is your last of the eight into your two days off. And the guys over here 
work the full swing, where it's first, second and third. I'm not really familiar how that works to 
explain that, but that's a four-week rotation. So, they only have, well, us too only one weekend 
off a month.  
 
VP: 
And so, and so why did that work look like? And because the quarry is nearby, but it’s 
not exactly on side.   
 
PG: 
It's a mile away. So, we have a belt system that runs from the quarry to this facility right 
here that's in the back there. They frame it. Actually, there's a belt line runs under Nazareth 
about halfway. Yeah, it's pretty wild. It's cool. I really enjoyed the quarry, but I got pulled off 
the quarry. They changed the crews from six to five after Corona, when we came back because 
we were laid off for five weeks. And they just, I guess the financial squeeze, whatever 
happened. Yeah, they broke us down into five guy rotation and the three little guys, I was one 
of the three little guys and I had to come back. That's why I'm in the labor department right 
now.  
 
VP: 
Did you like working outside?  
 
PG: 
Yeah. Yeah, I enjoyed. The quarry was nice because in the wintertime, I mean, if you're 
in a haul truck, you're not really outside. Thing’s got heat, so it's pretty cool. But yeah, I don't 
mind working outside. 
 
VP: 
But here at the plant… 
 
PG: 
Yeah, it's every day outside most of the year and yeah, every day.  
 
VP: 
And so, what did the typical schedule at the quarry look like?  
 
[00:11:28] 
 
PG: 
That's, that's a six to two also, six to two and then two to ten, that’s your middle shift. 
A lot of overtime, too. Normally coming in, so if you’re on first shift, you’d come at two in the 
morning till two in the afternoon and if they wanted you to stay over on night shift, that was 
two in the afternoon to two in the morning. So, yeah, there was a lot of overtime because they 
6 
 
needed stone to make the cement's, it’s the first process, it’s the it's the start of everything. So, 
if that A frame is low, they're most likely working overtime.  
 
VP: 
So, there are some people who are exploding, they’re ...  
 
PG: 
Yeah, that's an outside contract. Yeah, it's outside contractor. Yeah. But we're still, we 
help out. So, we close roads, they dig, there's holes that have to be dug and we have to bring 
this material up, it's called stemming that what they put into the holes after they put the C4 in 
it helps with the combustion, I'm not really sure exactly what it does. Yeah, and we, you know, 
move stuff that has to be moved. So, it's, you know, they do it, but we also help out. Yeah. It's 
a pretty cool process when you see it the first couple of times, it's really cool, but then you just 
kind of get used to it.  
 
VP: 
And so, at the quarry, you just, you drive the trucks, basically moving ...  
 
PG: 
Yeah. So, there's, well when there's the five guy rotation, there's two loader positions 
and then they'll be three what's called quarry utility and those are the three truck drivers. And 
then there's two loaders that drive the big loader machines and they just go to a shot and fill the 
trucks. Simple.  
 
VP: 
So, what do the two different positions do?  
 
[00:13:04] 
 
PG: 
The loader will load the haul truck and the haul truck will drive your whole truck to the 
crusher. They dump it into the crusher, gets ground up right onto the belt system, and that 
comes over. So, it's a pretty, I mean, there's a lot more involved, but that's a pretty easy way to, 
you know, a lot of traveling, a lot of driving. There's two quarries that we pull out of. So, we 
have a tunnel system over Nazareth Pike here that runs under it. And the one on, would be the 
west side is eight levels and the one on the east side is six levels.  
 
VP: 
What does that mean? 
 
PG: 
So there's benches, it goes down eight levels. It's not quite a story, but just think you're 
going eight stories the opposite way, the easy way to explain it. Yeah, that one’s pretty deep.  
 
VP: 
So, one is eight and the other one is six.  
 
PG: 
Six, yeah. And I believe they are permitted to go to fifteen levels, but they get smaller. 
The deeper you get it, obviously you go, you go smaller.  
 
VP: 
And is that a more dangerous job to work? 
 
[00:14:14] 
 
PG: 
Yeah, I feel like it was because I was the ground guy so that, you know, the rock faces, 
it's never guaranteed that, you know, stones are always dropping. You know, they're always a 
natural element of, you know, things that can happen. And there has been times where I was 
feeling pumps the middle of the night and I hear stuff dropping right next to me. So, and you 
can't see. So, there's that element of danger. Yeah. Like, just tripping on stones is a little 
7 
 
different than like walking around here, you know. You kind of fall a lot and you've got to be 
careful where you fall because you can fall pretty high. Here, the dust inhalation is a lot more 
dangerous for sure, you know, with all like the silica and all this bad stuff in the stone and stuff 
like that and the dust here. So, I guess I would say here it's probably a little bit more dangerous.  
 
VP: 
So, the quarry is not lit, but you’re still working at night?  
 
PG: 
Yeah, we have like portable wacker lights that you can move around for light and I 
mean around our crusher and the roads coming down to the quarry that are have pole lights. 
But yeah, it's dark, it's really dark, you know. 
 
VP: 
Do wear different types of equipment as well at the two different workplaces? 
 
PG: 
No, just your normal work with the reflector on it, your work clothes, just reflector on 
it, I mean, you still wear a hard hat, glasses. Yeah, nothing, nothing else. You know, for 
visibility. 
 
VP: 
So, and so I imagine it's a more solitary experience because you're sitting in a truck and 
you don't communicate as much.  
 
PG: 
Yeah, and we only really have a supervisor on first shift. So, second shift the shift 
foreman over here is your boss. So, if there's a problem, you call them and they can come right 
over, it's not a problem. But, yeah, I mean, we always, a lot of people say the quarry runs itself. 
It does. Like, you don't really need a boss, you know, just kind of it's a pretty easy process. 
You know, you load stone onto a truck, put into a crusher. As long as the crusher is working 
the way it should, it's just kind of go.  
 
VP: 
So, it's a lot of kind of independent work.  
 
PG: 
Yeah. Yeah, for sure. And, you know, they track your numbers, so they know what 
you're doing. You know, there's ways to, there's scales on our belts so they know how much 
stones coming over. If you look over at those, those readouts, the quarry, they're not running 
right now because it's in red, you'd be able to see your metric tons per hour right there, so they 
can tell like what's coming over. So, they know, like if, you know, guys are slack a little bit, 
they know what's going on.  
 
VP: 
And so, are they measuring the entire team's load or individually?  
 
PG: 
Yeah, it's the team. Yep. Yeah, it's the team, your shift. Yeah, it's always kind of a 
competition with the three crews over there.  
 
VP: 
Oh, is that really?  
 
PG: 
Yeah, just a fun competition. Sure, but it's fun.  
 
VP: 
And so who's who wins typically? 
 
PG: 
It's pretty close. It's normally pretty close because normally if there was a problem on 
first shift, they're trying to figure it out if we didn't get it figured out by first shift. So, it runs 
into second shifts. So, it's normally very close.  
8 
 
 
VP: 
Do you typically get a lunch period as well?  
 
PG: 
Yeah, same thing. You get a half an hour. Yeah.  
 
VP: 
Do you eat together?  
 
PG: 
Well, when I was there, when it was six, five of us would and then there were one of 
the two loaders would always stay out because we have a stockpile that's close to the crusher, 
so that they would feed the crusher when we were on break, they would just take their load or 
go into the pile and manually just put it right into the pressure. You wouldn't need a truck for 
that so that there was someone always going.  
 
VP: 
So how did they do that?  
 
PG: 
Every other day they just rotate. Yeah, they were just, you know, one day I'll do it. You 
do it the next day and they still get a break, but not with everybody. So, they have to take break 
by themselves, which some guys didn't mind it. You know, some guys would just they would 
do it all the time. And they take the break by themselves. 
 
VP: 
Are there particular tools that you use on a regular basis? 
 
[00:18:19] 
 
PG: 
Here, I would say skid steers, jackhammers. We have little machine called the dinga. 
We use that a lot, it's just a walk behind skid steer that you can manually use. We use that a lot 
because it's smaller. You can get in a tight spot. In the quarry, same thing: jackhammer and 
skid steer. And if you're cleaning, if I mean, if you're driving, you're obviously in your piece 
of equipment and yeah, that's a 55 ton haul truck.  
 
VP: 
Do you ever modify tools?  
 
PG: 
No, that’s illegal, you're not allowed to do that.  
 
VP: 
Maybe they did it back in the day.  
 
PG: 
Yeah, I'm sure they had. Yeah.  
 
VP: 
Because I know you guys have a machine shop, so.  
 
PG: 
Yeah, the maintenance guys. Yeah. They, I think they can get away with a little bit more 
than we can but yeah. Like, yeah that's a no no if MSHA would come in with a tool that you 
modify. That's a no no.  
 
VP: 
So, um, is there kind of additional training that workers can get?  
 
PG: 
Yeah. So, if you go on to maintenance, a lot of times if you don't have any welding or 
burning experience, they will send you to a tech school for training the electrical department. I 
believe they'll send you to some type of a lot of electrical certification classes, if you choose. I 
don't think you have to, but obviously, you know, definitely the way you want to go.  
9 
 
 
VP: 
So, do you become friends with your coworkers?  
 
PG: 
Yeah, we're all pretty close. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's times, you know, it gets hot 
and heavy, like anywhere, you know, long hours and stuff. But yeah, no everyone, there's no 
you know, not one department doesn't like the other. It's not like that. It's just a bunch of guys 
just trying to, you know, do we have to do.  
 
VP: 
And so, do you go and hang out after work together?  
 
PG: 
Yeah, it's very tricky for us to try to do that because with being a swing shift, you know, 
the first shift guys, obviously it's a little easier, but like the swing guys, it's always like night 
you have off, hey, you off, no I’m working second, or I’m overnight shift. So, it's not easy to. 
But yeah, we try to for sure.  
 
VP: 
And the company creates some opportunities for everyone to get together.  
 
PG: 
Yeah, yeah, they do, and our union, you know, it's a union shop here, so our union also 
has some picnic and stuff like that where, you know, we're allowed to go with our families and 
stuff.  
 
VP: 
So, you mentioned that you have other family members working in the industry, do you 
talk about cement at home?  
 
PG: 
Yeah, there's times like at family picnics that we'll talk about, you know, what's going 
on and never anything, you know, I try to leave work here, but, yeah, we talk about it just 
because it's close. We, you know, we all have done it. And it's pretty much the same thing here 
is the same thing over there. It's not like, not made any different. So, everything is very similar. 
You know, their belt lines are probably a little different and stuff like that. But it's the same 
process. 
 
VP: 
Do you disagree at all about particular ways … 
 
PG: 
Um, no, no, no, we don't we don't argue about anything like that.  
 
VP: 
There's no seniority card that someone pulls? 
 
PG: 
Yeah. I mean, they might say, you know, like, yeah, suck it up. You've been here for 
four years. I've been doing it for thirty. Yeah. For sure. Yeah. Yeah I do.  
 
VP: 
Do you sometimes as questions or some kind of guidance? 
 
[00:21:48] 
 
PG: 
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. If I have a question, you know, all the guys here are really 
helpful. I mean I have my cousins over there and stuff but yeah. Yeah, everyone's really helpful. 
It's definitely no question you know, ask a question. You don't want to see anyone get hurt, you 
know, or break anything and have someone else get hurt or, you know, make extra work for 
everybody. So, yeah, if you have a question, you just ask. 
 
10 
 
VP: 
Do you think that's a major draw for people to work in the industry? Um, connections 
between family?  
 
PG: 
Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't say a draw. I was always I can remember being a kid driving 
by the cement plants and I can remember telling my dad, like I'm going to work there. And it 
was kind of a weird thing, like, when I got the job here, I was like, wow, that actually did 
happen. You know, it was pretty cool. Yeah, I don't know, I just drove always drove by and 
saw it. I'm like, I'm going to do that. And I mean, my uncle, I knew he was a swing shift guy 
his whole career there. And I always knew, like, it's long hours, it's not easy with the family 
and stuff, it's rough. But I don't know, I just still always wanted to do it.  
 
VP: 
What do you think was the draw for you?  
 
[00:22:58] 
 
PG: 
Um, a draw. You lose a lot of family time, you do, you know, especially in the 
summertime, a lot of picnics. You miss a lot, you do. I don't know. Time goes fast with kids. 
So, yeah, you're here a lot, you don't have to be. But it's also, you know, pretty well-paying 
job. You can, you know, set yourself up financially here, kind of make whatever you want for 
the most part.  
 
VP: 
And you mentioned that you wanted to work here as a kid. So, what was so exciting 
about the plant?  
 
PG: 
I'm not sure, I just always just remember passing it, being like just seeing it being a little 
kid in awe, I guess. And then even when I walked on here my after my interview, I had a tour, 
even walking around, it's like, whoa! And I'm sure like when you look outside, you know, you 
see it. It's big. It's intimidating. But I don't know. I guess it was just the visual intrigued me.  
 
VP: 
And did you ever visit the plant as a kid?   
 
[00:23:33] 
 
PG: 
I did get to go on a tour when I was younger, maybe ten years old, from up with my 
uncle before, like, insurances were crazy. But we actually, you know, put hardhats on, put your 
vest on and we got to take a little tour, you know, around the main, you know, route, I guess I 
would say.  
 
VP: 
So, you mentioned, you know, your family is connected to the industry, have your 
classmates come to work in the industry or helped other people join?  
 
PG: 
Yeah, no one directly from my school in my grade. From my school, yeah. It's a pretty 
small area. So, there's been kids, you know, that I noticed, you know, I'm like, oh, man, I think 
I went to school or played a sport against him. So yeah, for sure. That's pretty cool.  
 
VP: 
Do you ever kind of visit other plants to see how they're doing things?  
 
PG: 
I think they do that, I've never personally done it. We were actually going to go when I 
was in the quarry. We were going to go to another plant for a tour that we were going to go and 
then they were going to come. And then Corona and it got stopped because of the, you know, 
11 
 
obviously they didn't want any extra people there if they didn't have to have them, which was 
going to be cool. I was pretty excited about that. But it got stopped.  
 
VP: 
And where was that? 
 
PG: 
It was in Evansville, our sister playing over in Evansville.  
 
PG: 
Yep.  
 
VP: 
So how else do you think that the pandemic changed the work landscape?  
 
[00:25:24] 
 
PG: 
For us, I mean, I would say the mask, but a lot of times we were a mask no matter what, 
just because of the dust and stuff. So, dust, and it was the whole our company would you know, 
if you had a family member, that was diagnosed with it or whatever that you were, you had to 
be mandatory time off, so that definitely affect us. Just workforce, you know, took our numbers 
down and, you know, if it took a swing shift person away, that, that's one less they have on 
shift so that, you know, the next crew might have to say, you know, work a double sometimes. 
So, made for more, you know, more overtime for people. But also, you know, it made it pretty, 
pretty tight with the workforce around here, especially in the beginning. But it seemed like it's 
kind of calmed down a little bit.  
 
VP: 
There's just been a heavier load for … and more hours.   
 
PG: 
Yeah, for sure. Yeah. Are a lot more hours, more opportunity for everyone for overtime 
to try to help out, you know. Yeah, I would say that was probably the most the mass. And a lot 
of times a lot of us will wear masks, especially in the labor department when we're at lansing 
or jackhammered and stuff. When there's a lot of dust in an area, we normally, I suggest to the 
newer guys, put a mask on. You don't want to blow and suck all this dust in, it's no good.  
 
VP: 
Can you feel it after?  
 
PG: 
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. You feel it. And it's strange because you can tell, you can feel the 
difference in the, so, like the stone dirt is not that bad. And then so the stone gets ground up 
into our, what we call raw dirt. That's not so bad. But then when it gets through the kiln then is 
made to clinker, that dust hurts, like you can actually feel the difference.  
 
VP: 
How do you mean it hurts?  
 
PG: 
Well, it's kind of gross. It gets built up in your nose and like you feel it kind of in your 
lungs. You can feel a little bit of the, not really sure, called a burn, I guess. So, I am always 
wearing a mask around clinker, I learned that pretty quick. And clinker dust, if it gets on your 
skin, especially in the summertime when you're sweating, it'll burn your skin a little bit, irritates 
your skin. Yeah, we have stuff the company supplies creams to put on and it does work like a 
skin shield, foam that we can put on.  
 
VP: 
Before going out? 
 
PG: 
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah it works.  
12 
 
 
VP: 
Do workers use that?  
 
PG: 
No, I feel like some of us do. It's just personal choice I guess if you don't. But, I've 
noticed if you're sweating and you get that on you, you're going to get some type of irritation. 
 
VP: 
And then your clothes might get really dusty.  
 
PG: 
And yeah, I'm pretty clean today and it's, you know, I might look a little dirty. Yeah, 
we get really dirty. Yeah. And we have a, we have a uniform company. So, you know, you 
have a new pair of clothes every day.  
 
VP: 
Oh wow.  
 
PG: 
Yeah.  
 
VP: 
Do they recycle the clothes?  
 
PG: 
Yeah, they get washed. Yeah. Yeah we have. Yeah. Once a week they pick up and then 
deliver your clothes for the week.  
 
VP: 
That's nice.  
 
PG: 
Yeah, yeah it's pretty cool. Yeah. You don't have to, it's personal choice. You can wear 
your own clothes if you want but it wrecks your washing machine, this dirt, it's no good.  
 
VP: 
How about your car?  
 
[00:28:41] 
 
PG: 
Oh yeah. I have a cement car. Yeah.  
 
VP: 
What do you mean? 
 
PG: 
Just an older car because yeah, you go in dirty and you know a lot of dust you're going 
to see on your car. You're going to have dust on your car when you leave here. We're actually 
not running, so you might not, which is good but, yeah it gets dusty.  
 
VP: 
So, you have a car that you take to work?  
 
PG: 
Yeah. And then I have another car. Yeah. Yeah, I guess. Yeah, I learned that real quick. 
I'm like, I have to find a I guess a beater car and I have my nicer car that I don't drive here.  
 
VP: 
So, did it damage your paint basically?  
 
PG: 
Yeah. I just didn't want to have to wash my car after every day of work. That's just 
hassle.  
 
VP: 
That's amazing. So, I'm curious about how your new job is going, since, you, now you're 
managing other people, other laborers.  
13 
 
 
PG: 
Yeah, yeah. So it's OK. When I came over, I was pretty bummed when I got taken off 
the quarry position, but it was, you know, seniority. It's a union shop, so seniority goes seniority 
rules. But I came back and I didn't get the labor position, the lead man right away. So, I came 
back for about two or three months. And then I actually got pulled in by our AGM and GM 
and they wanted to start the lead man position back up. And they wanted to know, they said, 
we we're going to choose you if you want it. And yeah, financially, it's a little more money. 
And, you know, I kind of took a pay cut when I went from the quarry, came back here and, you 
know, it made it more in the middle financially. So, at first I took it for the money, I did, not 
going to lie. But then now that I'm doing it, I enjoy it. You know, I like the newer guys come 
in and I've been here now for years and kind of feel like I know, you know, the ins and outs of 
things and just try to, like, just my thing is, like, I don't want to see anyone get hurt, you know, 
ask me all the questions you want and it will never annoy me. And there's times like I've had 
my last rotation and new people with seven people. So, I had seven guys for like a month and 
a half that. And like, if they have to go to the bathroom, I have to go with them. It's just like a 
new policy when the one guy got lost his leg, you know, our company as a whole, you know, 
like no orange hat, you wear an orange hat for your first three months and then you switch to a 
yellow hat and that's your probation, you get through your probation. So, no orange hat can 
walk around by themselves anymore. And it's even down to like if they have to go to the 
bathroom, it's like school, like have to ask me permission. And if I can leave the job site, like 
we have to walk to the bathroom, but it can be a lot, but I also like agree with it, especially the 
first couple of weeks. But yeah, until and then if I feel comfortable, you know, you can go 
yourself, go down to break if you want to take an early break or you know, whatever, if I want 
to stay out, you know, it just goes by my discretion. If I feel like I'm comfortable letting you, 
letting you on your own.   
 
VP: 
What would you say is your favorite part of the job?  
 
PG: 
Um, my favorite part of the job is the satisfaction of if we get put on a big job and we, 
you know, we get it done and you can never, there's no, you know, you can't be satisfied being 
a laborer because you might get an area really clean one day and come in the next day. And it 
looks the same as you started. It happens a lot. But I guess if we get a big job done and, you 
know, in a good amount of time and everyone's happy, I guess that's for me that's a pretty 
rewarding.  
 
VP: 
How long does it take to clean an area typically, how big are the jobs?  
 
PG: 
Well, it all depends how long it's let go, pretty much with spillage and stuff. And you 
can imagine, like, if there's an area where we're in our finished cement, you know, on a beltline, 
you know, that hits the ground and sits for a while, moisture gets to it, obviously turns to 
concrete. So, a job like that will take a lot longer, a lot more excavating work. But if it's just 
raw dirt, you know, it's relatively quick, especially with machines. And the four guys we have 
right now, we've all been here now for a little while. So, we're pretty fast. We kind of know the 
tricks of doing things. But when you're new, it's a little different, slower.  
 
VP: 
What are some of the tricks? 
 
PG: 
Um, uh, I guess air lansing is not very legal here, but that's just taking the airline and 
blowing the dust away from your area, easy way to clean it. And just tricks with the machines, 
14 
 
knowing how to get into tighter areas and getting full buckets every time so you're not back 
and forth with this gets steer, just simple tricks. 
 
VP: 
So, it takes some time to figure out.  
 
[00:33:37] 
 
PG: 
Yeah, sure. I mean, I came in my best friend is a dairy farmer, so I was on his skid steer 
since I was little. So that helps if you've ever especially starting on labor, if you can run a skid 
steer, you have a head start. Definitely. And then also our other big, our big tool in the labor 
department is called the suck truck. So, we have a big vacuum truck that we can use if the 
material is like in a fine, fine stage, that we can suck it up. And that's a two-guy crew. It's a big 
machine, you have to roll out this big air, we actually use water line, plastic lines, and that's 
where the material will travel through into our vacuum truck. Yeah, it's a pretty, pretty cool 
machine. It can suck up material really fast. It's another, it's a dangerous piece of equipment 
because, like, your hands can get stuck in it and stuff like that, but it's really helpful. I like the 
suck truck.  
 
VP: 
Is that your favorite?  
 
PG: 
Yeah, it's probably my favorite piece of equipment to use. And it gets the most overtime.  
 
VP: 
How long does it take you?  
 
PG: 
On a job, you start the suck truck in the morning and you're on that job until you go 
home for the most part. Yeah, the set up can take a little while because you got to run a hose to 
some places, but.  
 
VP: 
Are there jobs that take more than a day?  
 
PG: 
Oh yeah, there's jobs. Yeah, we'll get put on a job and a lot of times it's hard for them 
to, like, day-to-day, keep us on the same job, like back-to-back just because something bad is 
spilled the night before. So, it's like you might start on a Monday, finish it on a Friday. It does 
happen like that because there's not enough guys. So, we kind of have to keep the plant running. 
And it is what it is.  
 
VP: 
Do workers have like their favorite machine or tool? 
 
PG: 
Oh, yeah, definitely. Yeah. And everyone has their own little way of doing things, but 
everyone has their favorite tool for sure. Yeah. And like our jackhammers, like we all kind of 
have our own jackhammer and you know, one might be lighter. One guy likes a heavier one, 
one guy likes a lighter one and just all personal preference.  
 
VP: 
You don't put names on them or anything?  
 
[00:35:44] 
 
PG: 
Yeah, we do. Yeah, we paint them. It's just kind of like a, like your jackhammer. Yeah, 
we paint them. I don’t think we’re really supposed to do that, but we do.  
 
15 
 
VP: 
That's funny.  
 
PG: 
Yeah.  
 
VP: 
So, kind of personalize.   
 
PG: 
Yeah, customize your equipment without like physically doing it because like I said 
before, that can't really do that. There is tools out there that we've modified just to make it 
easier and just try to if MSHA ever comes in, you just throw that in the corner.  
 
VP: 
So, there's a lot of automation on the plant. Do you sort of feel that in your specific line 
of work?  
 
PG: 
Yeah, no, we don't really deal with that. But yeah, there is. I mean, it's wild to think 
how old that plant looks. And we have a central control, which is a berm about the size. It's full 
of monitors and they are in control of everything out there, everything down to the starting and 
stopping of belts, turning dust collectors on and off, screws on and off. So, yeah, there is a lot 
of, I was amazed by that. Like, thinking like all this old plant, you can do that. And even Central 
runs the quarry a mile and a half down the road. Now, it's all communication through a phone 
or radio, like, hey, can you turn this belt on, this belt off? But it's cool. Like, you don't have to 
be right there. I was kind of amazed by that, that you would think like maybe that have a central 
control over there, but they don't, they just run it all from up here. Yeah, it's pretty crazy.  
 
VP: 
Yeah. I imagine it looks like some sort of nuclear plant room.   
 
PG: 
Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty crazy. I believe there's probably about twenty screens in there. 
Yeah. Yeah. That's the, that's an hourly position, but nothing I'd ever be interested in.  
 
VP: 
Why not? 
PG: 
You got to sit in this chair all day. It's a big responsibility. It's a lot. And like I've been 
here for years, I don't think I would even, I'm sure I could learn a little better. But, you know, 
there's a lot of belts that I still kind of forget and stuff like that. Yeah, I don't think that's 
something I would ever be interested in.  
 
VP: 
Well, just to wrap up, is there anything that I haven’t asked that might be helpful to 
articulate?  
 
PG: 
Um, no. I think we hit it. We kind of stayed on the labor topic. No, I think we kind of, 
it's the daily life of laborer.  
 
VP: 
Well, thank you so much for your time.  
 
PG: 
Yeah, no problem.
