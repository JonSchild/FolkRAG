KS: This is Kim Stryker, and I’m here on September 2nd which is actually a Thursday, 
2017. Uh, it’s about 2:40pm and I’m sitting here with Bob –How do you pronounce your 
last name? 
Bob: Grouge 
Kim: Grouge, like Rouge. 
Bob: Exactly. 
Kim: OK and… Bob is the Director of Tasting Room Operations, so tell me a little bit 
about what that entails. 
#tastingroom #scheduling #staff 
Bob: Um… it has to do with a little bit of everything that’s involved with the Tasting 
Room itself, so it’s scheduling – to make sure we are staffed properly. It’s, uh, making 
sure that the staff that is there is trained. Um, in tasting techniques and etiquette. Um and 
making sure the Tasting Room itself is neat, clean, and presentable. [women laughing and 
talking in background] Up to date with menus and stuff like that. 
#employees #pourer #bartender 
Kim: How many people do you have employed in the Tasting Room part, do you know? 
Bob: So on a busy day, let’s say a Saturday, I will have uh, approximately 14 pourers – 
which in other industries is called a bartender. 
Kim: Yeah. 
Bob: Um and then 10 to uh…14 runners or buspeople. 
Kim: Uh huh 
Bob: … a hostess or floor manager or 3. Um, and then PROBABLY two back of the 
house managers. 
Kim: Wow. That’s a lot of people. 
Bob: That’s a lot of people.

Kim: I haven’t been to a BIG winery yet, I’ve only been to some of the really small, 
independent ones that are like, you know, Mom and Dad kind of running it so… 
Bob: Yeah 
Kim: So they are like, Uh it’s me! … OK so that’s a big team to keep on top of 
everything, and {talking in background] what is the capacity of a place like this? 
Bob: We have approximately 260 seats inside and about 650 outside. 
Kim: Wow. 650 outside. Yeah, I noticed that there was the immediate parking area, and 
then there was additional, and additional, and… 
Bob: Additional. 
Kim: Yeah. 
Bob: Yes. 
Kim: That, that seems to be the trick out here because it’s so … hilly… to actually find 
enough flat space to actually put people. 
Bob: Yep. 
#restaurant #restaurantbusiness 
Kim: Um. OK So. So Mostly your job is, would you say, that it is similar to running a 
restaurant? 
Bob: Exactly. 
Kim: OK so… 
#winetasting #bar 
Bob: Exactly. Making sure that we are staffed. And have our product ready for… whether 
it’s a busy day or a slow day… And adjusting levels based on both of those based on 
what we expect to do that day. Um… and then, once we open, directing people as to 
where they can and cannot taste, which bars are open, which bars are not, um… we DO 
take reservations for large groups –groups of 8 or more – um so we make sure that the bar 
is set ready for them to go at the specific time. [background males voices continue] And 
then direct them to those bars. 
#barreloak 
Kim: Right. So maybe we should back up and say… describe Barrel Oak to someone 
who is… isn’t SEEING it right now, I mean is just listening to it. The SIZE of it alone 
is… impressive. It’s a very BIG …space. 
#normanrockwell #painting #americanart 
Bob: [talking over] I like to, I like to reference a Norman Rockwell, uh painting.

Kim: OK 
Bob: Where quite often you see all the families playing in a yard or a park, um and when 
you come up our driveway, that’s exactly what our picnic area looks like. We probably 
have 60 plus picnic tables out there. And families will be all over that hill: kids playing 
games, Mom and Dad enjoying the wine or a beer, uh picnic lunches, plus our food 
trucks! Um, and it’s just a great place for uh, family and friends to get together and have 
a great time! [voices in background] 
#kitchen #food 
Kim: Um, so seems like… Do you serve FOOD as well or do you have prepared food 
or…? 
Bob: We, we have a very LIMITED pantry. So, we do not have a restaurant, we do not 
have a REAL kitchen. Everything that we have comes in prepared so that the cheese is 
already sliced, the meat’s sliced, we just put it on a plate. 
Kim: Uh huh. 
#healthpermits #boardofhealth 
Bob: With the exception of our brie and our baguette –we don’t heat anything up. Those 
two items are [unintelligible] Exactly. It’s part of our, uh, licensing, and um permit, based 
on health… 
Kim: Yeah. 
Bob: Health permit. 
#orchards 
Kim: Yeah, I think that’s pretty similar to the orchards in the area. They can have pies 
and things that they warm up? 
Bob: Yeah. 
Kim: …That they warm up on site, but unless they have a fully functional and approved 
kitchen, they can’t COOK from scratch. 
Bob: Exactly. 
Kim: Yeah. 
Bob: Yes. So. And we do invite food trucks out or uh offsite vendors. 
#tent #tentbar 
Kim: So what is this uh – just outside the entrance is this big uh, big tented area with 
tables around, like sort of for… 
Bob: So that is our TENT bar.

Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
Kim: OK 
Bob: And that bar ALONE can cover a reservation of … up to –I believe it is – 75 
people. 
Kim: Wow. [background talking] 
Bob: So we get groups of 50 to 100 to 150 that come out, and if they want to do a uh 
TASTING, uh as a GROUP, we will do them at THAT bar, and sometimes we’ve gotta 
do them in two separate groups. If they are that large. 
Kim: Wow. Yeah, yeah. 
Bob: We have another bar that handles about 35 – 38 at one time. And then another one 
about 20. Another one about 25. And then the MAIN bar, we do NOT take reservations 
for –that’s where our walk-up traffic always goes. 
Kim: Oh yeah. And especially on the weekends… nice weather… you’re going to have a 
lot of walk-up traffic I’m assuming. 
Bob: YES. 
Kim: Yeah, um. 
Bob: Yes. 
#route66 
Kim: So let’s about the location as well. So from this hill, we can see… bits of route 66, 
out down the way… 
Bob: Uh huh. 
Kim: Um so is that… a big… part… of what Barrel Oak is…It’s how accessible it is? 
#tourism #highways #roadsideattraction 
Bob: That’s uh, and excellent question. And that’s one of the, the… what you would 
think of as one of the –I guess you could say it’s a focal point – “Oh everybody can see 
us from 66!” … The NUMBER of people who drive down 66 and don’t know how to 
GET to us is pretty amazing! 
Kim: Yeah! Well and… 
Bob: And the number of people that have… for 9 and a half years… have driven by and 
NEVER stopped in… And now they are finally going, “Oh I figured out how to get 
here!” Um, so, it’s two things: it’s a blessing and it’s a curse. We don’t know how to get 
there, but we can certainly see you! 
Kim: Yeah! 
Bob: Um so…

Kim: (laughing) So you hear that a lot! 
Bob: Yeah! 
Kim: OK 
Bob: Yeah the other side of the coin is that the people who are HERE staring out at these 
beautiful views… and just thinking about, “Wow! Look at ALL the people who are 
driving by and have no idea that they could be swinging in here very easily!” 
Kim: Yeah! 
Bob: So… 
Kim: That’s probably part of the vicarious thrill of being here, is that you can kind of 
look at all the ‘poor saps’, you know, going home from work or whatever it is and you 
are having a good time. Um… so… where do most of your customers come from here? 
#thedistrict #dc #washingtondc #maryland #frederickburg #frederick #loudoncounty 
#virginia 
Bob: We, um, draw from a LOT of places. Um… um… travelers who have passed a 
NUMBER of times and now they go, “Oh now I know how to get there!” The weekends, 
we will get busloads and uh vanloads of people from as far away as obviously the 
District. 
Kim: Hmm. 
Bob: Uh, um uh Maryland. Um… Frederickburg. Um… FREDERICK, Maryland. Um, 
so it its, we pull from everywhere. Um Loudoun County. 
Kim: Where do these groups usually… like what is their commonality? Is it like… just 
a… 
 
[00:08:45] Bob: Typically, if it’s a –uh- a group of 15 or more it’s usually a group that 
have gone in and they'll do a wine tour. So they're going to hit a number of the wineries 
that will allow more than 8 people to come to their doorstep. So they line that up and they 
do a tasting at some or all of them, or they'll do a tasting at one and then just end their 
day at another. Depends on who they are and what they're looking to achieve. 
 
#hills #landscape #geography 
 
[00:09:11] I would think a lot of just knowing how the property is the whole area is very 
very hilly, little mini-mountains all around, and some of the drives are definitely not bus- 
accessible, I’d think. So you're one of the ones that can accommodate those groups. 
 
#winemaking

Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
[00:09:36] How much of the wine do you have anything in your role, do you have any 
role in the actual wine-making? 
 
#winetasting #acidlevels #sugarlevels #acid #sugar 
 
[00:09:44] I don't. Occasionally to taste some which one you do a flight tasting and get to 
determine based on our taste buds which ones we think that our guests would like. So we 
do five versions of one kind of wine and they'll have different acid levels or sugar levels 
and which one we think we with those blends, which one we think the guests would like 
most. 
 
[00:10:20] Is there a huge favorite of the public of the wines that you offer that you tend 
to see them coming more for? 
 
#bauhauswhite #bauhausred #redwine #whitewine #cabernetfranc #cabernetsauvignon 
#wineclub 
 
[00:10:26] We can definitely say that our Bauhaus white and our Bauhaus red are our two 
most popular. We sell those the most. With that said, we also produce the most of those. 
There are others that we produce less like Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, and we 
just ran out of both of those. So we sell out of. But we also produce a smaller amount. 
 
[00:10:55] And do you also do a wine club? 
We have several different wine clubs, yes. 
[00:11:02] What percentage roughly the wine club makes up versus people who actually 
come into the place? 
 
[00:11:11] In sales? And in people I would say probably ten percent is the club. 
 
[00:11:21] The club is a small part. [BG agrees.] And does it offer the discount? We have 
about 5 or 6 different clubs you can join. Each one being unique in a different way. 
 
#vienna #fauquiercounty #virginia #barreloak 
 
[00:11:34] Different levels? Different quantities [he agrees.] What did you do before you 
came here? You said you lived Vienna before? 
 
#crosspromotion #marketing 
 
[00:11:44] I moved out to Fauquier county in 1988, grew up in Vienna. I've spent 30 
years in the restaurant business and 10 plus years in the car industry. I've known Brian, 
the owner of Barrel Oak, since 2009. And we have done Pinktsia [former restaurant?]  
one of the restaurants that I had I carried his wines but I also did a lot of marketing with 
him. Cross-promotion with him. We served on a couple of different chamber boards 
together and were involved

in chambers and different marketing groups. Finally, a year and a half ago we chatted and 
I came on board here. 
 
#clairesatthedepot #clairesdepot #warrenton #brianroeder 
 
[00:12:26] Brian is Brian Roeder? [he agrees.] I actually met him at random. he was at 
Claire’s depot in Warrenton and he was sitting with my friend Sunny. So I saw Sunny 
and then I met him and he gave me a card. This is 2 or 3 years ago and he told me to 
come on up sometime. It took me this long! 
 
[00:13:02] Her and I go way back also. 
 
[00:13:12] What other hats do you find that you wear around here. 
 
#hr #humanresources #scheduling #schedule #events #eventmanagement #weddings 
#bachelorparty #bacheloretteparty #birthdayparty #parties #corporateevents #officeretreat 
 
[00:13:15] I'm also in charge of HR. I'm in charge of the schedules. 
Which has got to be pretty complicated. [BG agrees.] 
BG: And events. 
 
[00:13:30] KS: Do you have somebody who does the event management of the events 
separately, or do you oversee those? 
 
BG: Typically, I'm overseeing them and I'm putting them together. 
 
KS: So like a wedding or something? [he agrees.] What are the events that you tend to 
have here? 
 
[00:13:47] BG: Fewer weddings than you would think. Because everybody wants to do a 
wedding on a Saturday. And as busy as we are...nobody wants to pay that kind of start 
price for a wedding. So there's a lot of birthday parties, a lot of bridal showers, 
bachelorette parties, and some of these company office parties whether it be holiday or 
some other seasonal reason. Annual summer event for a company. Some of these are 
private events, and some of these are just a large group coming out and they just need 
coordinating. So there's different levels of how involved I need to be. And how involved I 
don't need to be. 
 
#winery #career 
 
[00:14:45] Why did you come to the winery at this point in your life, in your career? 
 
BG: It seemed like Brian and I were both looking for...he was looking for a change in the 
way that the winery was run, and I was looking for a change in my career. And we had

Winery Workers in Virginia

discussed it probably a year and a half to two years prior to me coming on board and it 
just wasn't right for both of us at that time. And then we re-visited not this past February 
but the February before. It was actually January when we visited it again and it just was 
right for both of us. 
 
[00:15:22] KS: When did Barrel Oak open? 
BG: Ten years ago this May. So 2008 in May. 
#training #tastings #winetasting #restaurantindustry 
 
[00:15:35] KS: I'm just writing notes as I gogeneral topics that we're talking about so I 
can see where there at in the tape if I have to go back to them. Did you have to go 
through any special training? You talked a little bit about doing tastings and stuff like 
that. 
 
[00:15:52] BG: My restaurant background and the fact that I was pretty comfortable with 
wine to begin with, I did not have to go through. I had to go through the typical Barrel 
Oak come on board staff training. Handbook, rules and regulations, things like that. But 
the position was perfect for me to step into. Once I learned a handful of processes it was 
pretty easy. 
 
#winemaker #winemaking #grapevines #vineyard #winery 
 
[00:16:23] KS: Does Brian directly oversee the wine-making, or does he have a 
winemaker? 
 
BG: He has a wine-maker. And an assistant wine-maker. 
 
KS: You must make a lot of wine, I guess you need a lot of wine-makers as you can get! I 
noticed there are grapevines planted all around the property. What are the varieties that 
you grow here? 
 
#varieties #chardonnay #viognier #cabernetfranc #cabernetsauvignon #hops #beer 
 
[00:16:48] BG: Yes. The front vineyard the Chardonnay, and the Viognier. The vineyard 
behind us over your right shoulder right now is the Cabernet Franc and Cabernet 
Sauvignon. We also have a hops back there for beer. 
 
[00:17:09] KS: You grow your own hops for the beer too, wow. 
#petitmanseng #cheval #norton #chambourcin #traminette 
[00:17:16] BG: And then we have Petit Manseng, Cheval, Norton, Chambourcin, 
Traminette, and I know I'm missing at least two.

#VirginiaWine #varietals 
 
[00:17:43] KS: That's fine. I don't need to know every single one! I'm sure it's somewhere 
on the website too. What's unique about Virginia wine? What do you tell people and they 
come and they say, "Virginia wine??" 
 
#virginiawine #californiawine #virginiawineries #soil #geography #longitudeandlagitude 
#climate #weather #hills #rocks #winery #winemakers #BottleShock 
#bottleshockthemovie #europe #terrain 
 
[00:18:03] BG: One of the things I like to say, Virginia wine is probably where California 
wine was about 30 years ago. And quickly up-and-coming, taking its place in the world. 
Very similar what Bottle Shock was with California wines in Europe. Virginia wines is 
not far behind that at all right now. There are a lot of Virginia wineries making some 
really good Virginia wine. Really good wine. I guess our uniqueness is that because of 
longitude and latitude and the type of the ground the geography, very similar to some of 
the best properties in Europe. It's hilly, it's got plenty of rock in the soil, it's just great for 
growing. the temperature, it's just great for growing wines. Proof of it is that we've got 
285 wineries just in one state! [laughs.] I think on that one, the winemakers and the 
winery owner would be able to give you a better idea. But that's why Virginia wine is 
here. Because of the terrain. It's a great place to grow wine. 
 
[00:19:42] KS: How much of the grapes do you also have to bring in grapes, or have 
them grown other places? 
 
BG: We have a couple other offsite spots right now. We do get some grapes from other 
parts of Virginia. We very specifically get some juice from Washington state. 
 
[00:20:03] KS: What's that for? 
 
#alberino #syrah #washingtonstate #juice #grapes 
 
BG: Typically for Alberino, which we make, but we get the juice from Washington State. 
And then our Syrah typically is juice from Washington State. We make the wine, but we 
get the juice from them. 
 
[00:20:20] KS: And that's just because you don't have success with growing that. 
 
BG: We don't have those growing here, and you have it's a wine that people look for 
certain times of the year and we do a pretty nice job of both of those. 
 
[00:20:36] KS: That's nice to have the flexibility. Where was the actual winemaking 
happen? 
 
BG: Directly below us. Actually directly below us is the brewery and below us on the 
other side of the building is where all the winemaking gets done.

#winemaking #staff #employees #harvest #november #grapevines #vineyard #pruning 
#picking #spraying #netting 
 
[00:21:01] KS: Do you have any idea how many people work with the winemaking 
itself? 
 
BG: We have a winemaker, an assistant winemaker, this time of year which is what we 
call harvest. Harvest is seen sometime around this time of year through November 1. 
 
[00:21:18] KS: Oh that late? 
 
BG: It can be. The vines dictate to us, the grapes dictate to us. but they've just started 
harvesting. So they'll have another cellar assistant or production assistant, and then they'll 
have the vineyard guys which I believe is right now about 5 employees. And that 
fluctuates between 3 and 5. 
 
[00:21:50] KS: And they're actually doing like pruning? 
#sugar #sweet #birds #pests #bugs #insects #deer #fungus 
BG: Pruning, picking, any spraying that we do, we currently are using, I don't know if 
you noticed the netting when you came out. How some of it is much higher on the vines 
than in other spots? And that's a sign of the grapes are starting to get to where it's close to 
harvest, so their sugar content, their sweetness is going up, so the birds are getting 
attracted to them. So we see the birds flying near the vines, that's when we raise the nets 
up. 
 
[00:22:23] KS: So they indicate sweetness [BG agrees.] That's interesting. [00:22:33] 
Who else do you get out there eating your grapes? 
 
BG: Bugs, insects. I've been here for a year and a half, I've never seen a deer on the 
property. I'm not saying they're not here, but I haven't seen them. And I know that they've 
been some problems a long time ago, but I'm not sure...but the biggest thing is bugs. Bugs 
and fungus. 
 
#nakedmountain #arterrawines #appalachiantrail #bears #wildlife #vineyardpests 
 
[00:23:03] KS: I know some of the ones that are in parcels like I know Naked Mountain 
and Arterra they're both in very wooded areas, and they back up to the Appalachian trails 
back there, and the parks. And there's different wildlife protected. So they get bears, and 
evidently they just like to pull up the vines and throw them about. So that's one thing you 
can be grateful for. 
 
BG: They're not far from here...but they haven't been hanging around.

Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
[00:23:44] KS: What's your schedule here? when are you here? 
 
BG: I'm here Thursday-Monday. I'm off Tuesday-Wednesday. Which typically is the 
busy time. And then Mondays are let's catch up over the weekend and typically we have a 
meeting on Monday and let's go over everything that's happened. And then start 
preparing for the following week. By the following week, I mean the following weeks. 
 
[00:24:14] KS: You said before with the events, you try not to have them on Saturdays 
because it's a big income day for you guys [BG agrees.] So when do most of those events 
happen? 
 
BG: Friday nights, any time during the week we'll do a wedding. We've had a couple of 
wonderful weddings here on Thursday nights. Sometimes on Sunday night. Some of 
those other events we'll do like 11AM-2PM on either a Saturday or Sunday. As long as 
they all abide by the hours that we say, this is when you can have this space, this is what 
the space costs, then we'll have a party there. It's just very difficult, as busy as we get, to 
try to do one in the middle of the afternoon. Somebody wants to come in at 2:30-6, we'll 
set you up with a nice tasting, but that's about it. 
 
#alcohol #Inebriation #drunk #drunkenness #busses #busloads #bus 
 
[00:25:10] KS: What are some of the have there been any especially are there problems 
sometimes with these events that come up? I would assume alcohol, people are having a 
good time. 
 
BG: I can say in the year and a half that I've been here, that doesn't happen very often at 
all. We're very good about watching the amount of alcohol. When you are one of the 
wineries that does allow busloads of people to come in, you never know what number 
winery you are on their list. You can't control prior to getting here. So there have been 
times when people have gotten off the bus we've told the bus driver, don't leave, don't 
park, they're coming right back. Doesn't happen often. But it does. 
 
[00:25:57] if it's 50 people getting off the bus, and it looks like 10-20 of them you don't 
want to serve, you send them all back. Sorry. Try us again another time. We do try to get 
our large busloads to come in as the first winery. It doesn’t always work, though, but we 
try. 
 
KS: That's a good strategy! 
#weather #rain 
[00:26:18] BG: The biggest problem we have, when you book private parties and they 
take up a portion of your winery, is if the weather then turns. And you have all those 
people outside looking for space. 
 
[00:26:31] KS: And it can turn, can't it?

Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
BG: We've gotten very good at handling it. You know, every once in a while, you just go, 
"oh I wish I hadn't booked that party on that weekend." But if it would have been nice, it 
would have been successful. But it works. 
 
[00:26:50] KS: That's the risk. What are some of the things that you think make this place 
unique and special in the landscape of other wineries? 
 
#children #kids #kidfriendly #dogs #dogfriendly #picnic 
 
BG: One of the great things about this location is our openness to a little bit of everyone. 
You can bring your pups, you can bring your children. Very family-friendly. You know 
when children walk through the front door, one of the first things out of our mouth is, 
would your child like a juice box? And of course we have the parents' permission first, 
but we always have juice boxes available for the little ones. Sometimes we have face 
painting and balloons going for the children. Lately especially with the heat in August, 
the end of July early August we did have some heat, we had a flavored shaved ice lady 
doing cones and things like that. And the families love it. Still allowed to bring a picnic 
here, just no outside alcohol, you can't bring your own beverages, you can't anything to 
cook with, but we're still one of the bigger wineries that allows you to bring in your own 
food. And people really like that. 
 
#charity #donation #philanthropy #hurricane #harvey #irma #waaag#pets #texas 
#socialmedia #hsus 
 
[00:28:08] KS: I noticed that you had donations out front for the especially for the pets 
that are victims of the Houston Harvey hurricane. 
 
BG: One of the things that we do year-round but specifically more often in the 
wintertime, is we do a lot of fundraisers for private groups. And the ones who've taken 
advantage of that the most, are typically dog rescues or animal-rescue groups. And there 
is a local animal rescue group that shares part of the property that we have, and they're 
WAAAG. And we just did a fundraiser with them for the pets. And for the people of 
Texas. We brought in somewhere between 8 and 10 tons worth of product. Bedding, 
towels, cleaning supplies, pet food, pet bowls, leashes, cages, crates, everything. That 
horse trailer that's parked out front is full of gifts and there are four others like it. And 
then there's a barn on the other half of the building, where the tack room is full and two 
of the stalls are full. And they're now coordinating how to get that to Harvey. And 
there's     a semi lined up, it's just now all timing and getting the product out. What you 
saw at the front door was where people dropped off after we said we're no longer taking 
donations, so it's still coming in. 
 
[00:29:51] KS: I saw that on your social media the piles and stuff that were piling up and 
I think that's great. People if they're already coming here for fun and this is their favorite 
place to come on the weekend to be able to also do some good with it is great.

BG: And we also accepted monetary donations, so we've got a check for them. And we're 
going to do that again for Irma. We've already got little fliers out on the bar. Anyone who 
buys wine to go bottles to go we're going to donate 15% of those purchases towards 
benefitting Irma. 
 
KS: So you work with WAAAG to do that? 
 
[00:30:29] BG: I'm not sure who we're working with Irma, but definitely WAAAG for 
Harvey. Because that was all animal-focused other than the cash donations. Which is also 
going to be driven down there with that. 
 
[00:30:43] KS: So they distribute it then to HSUS or different groups that might be 
working with the animal situation? [He agrees.] That's great. Not a thing that you 
necessarily expect a winery to be able to do, so that's pretty nice. What are some other 
unexpected parts of your job? Maybe before you go into it you'd think, "I didn't imagine 
myself doing this!" 
 
#beer #blackfriday 
 
[00:31:13] BG: Honestly there aren't too many unexpecteds. I knew what Brian's 
structure was before I got here. I knew what he was trying to achieve. I knew what type 
of clientele he was targeting. So it's pretty easy to just fit in. I guess the biggest thing 
that's happened since I've been here is we've gotten into beer. So I've got to get my beer 
knowledge up to where it used to be when I was much younger. [KS laughs.] 
 
[00:31:42] KS: So how long has that been going? 
 
BG: Our first official poured beer was black Friday of last year. 
[00:31:55] KS: And it's been doing well? 
BG: Doing very well. Yes. 
 
[00:32:00] KS: How do you find groups divvy up with the who's going here to the beer 
area, and who's going to the wine area? 
 
#sales #breweries #warrenton 
 
BG: 10% of our sales to 12-13% of our sales has been beer, gross. We were targeting 8 
when we first opened up, and we're at 10-13 right now. Which is pretty good. And one of 
the things that we've noticed is that the group structure, whether it's 2 people or 10 
people, it used to go to a brewery one weekend and a winery the following weekend to 
appease all their friends, they know they can come here now and appease both. 
 
[00:32:37] KS: That's true, yeah. You tell someone you want to go out for Thai food and 
they don't like Thai food, if you can go to a restaurant that's like Pan-Asian, you can

cover all the bases, make everyone happy. And there's not as many breweries going on 
out here. 
 
BG: They are starting to—“explode” is no longer the word. Grow at a pretty rapid rate. 
There have been three, in the last four months open up within a 20 minute drive from 
here. So now there's even one in the heart of Warrenton right now. 
 
[00:33:17] KS: Oh I did see something about that. 
 
BG: So they are still growing. It's not as explosive as it was, but it's still a growing 
industry in this area.

#catoctincreek #johnmarshallhouse #supremecourt #justicejohnmarshall #barreloak 
 
[00:33:30] KS: The other thing I've noticed growing is the distilleries. There's quite a few 
more distilleries than there used to be. There's some in DC, there's some in Northern 
Virginia. I think there's one opening in Falls Church, where I'm from, which seems 
shocking to me. And out here as well, I know the Catoctin creek is not far. Is that 
something that you think you guys would ever get into? 
 
BG: I'll leave that up to Brian. He and I discussed it when I first came onboard. I pictured 
it over the John Marshall house, but we'll see. 
 
[00:34:04] KS: Is that the white house that's behind? Which one's the John Marshall 
house? 
 
BG: Look at our driveway, off to the left, in a fairly wooded area is this old white 
mansion. Old. And that's Supreme Court Justice John Marshall's old house. 
 
[00:34:23] KS: So that's technically part of this property? 
 
BG: We used to lease that piece. We don't now. They're doing something different with 
it. But it's still something that if I believe that if Brian really wanted to do something, that 
he and the property owner would just go right back to doing business again. 
 
[00:34:44] KS: Is that part of the story of Barrel Oak? 
 
#farmfarm #animals #pigs #chickens #horses #farm #winetasting #farmersmarket 
 
BG: At one time it was. We used to do a very upscale reserved tasting over there. That 
was before I came onboard. Then it went to, they had it as a farmer's market. They called 
it Farm Farm. They had different types of animals on the property--pigs, chickens horses, 
everything, so the kids could come out and see them. But it just it wasn't adding anything 
revenue-wise, and it was one heck of an upkeep. So we stopped that about two years ago.

[00:35:22] KS: OK. I think I remember. When the Farm Farm was happening. I was 
working with the orchards and a lot of the orchards in the fall will do that fall festivals 
sort of thing, or choose not to for different reasons. I noticed it on my radar when that 
was going on. So that's no longer. [He agrees.] So now it's just more focused on the 
central mission. 
 
BG: The beer and the wine. 
 
KS: Something tasty to drink. [BG agrees.] Do you see yourself working in this field for 
the next 5-10 years? 
 
BG: More than likely. 
 
KS: So you're pretty happy with it? 
BG: Very. 
[00:36:09] KS: What is it that you like so much about it? 
 
BG: Very similar to the restaurant business, you know you're doing the same job every 
day, but every day when you come to work, something different. You know, a different 
clientele walks through the door every day, you meet people every day. I am a people 
person. I love the product that we sell and beautiful, beautiful atmosphere. It's not hard 
driving up that driveway to go to work. 
 
#fauquier #fauquiercounty #warrenton #virginia #northernvirginia 
[00:36:43] KS: What part of Fauquier do you live in? 
BG: In Warrenton. 
 
[00:36:45] KS: Oh, in Warrenton. OK. No this is my favorite part of the county up here. 
It's so pretty. Warrenton is beautiful, but when you get out here all the stress goes away. 
 
BG: Exactly. 
 
[00:36:59] KS: But that's not my job. I don't work here, so maybe my stress would be 
here if I was working here. But you don't seem so stressed! It's not a terribly stressful job. 
 
#winery #power #poweroutage #weather #blackout #electriticy #middleburg #storm 
 
BG: What could be stressful about working in a winery? OK you could lose power. Well, 
guess what. 
 
KS: Light some candles and pour some wine.

BG: You don't need power to pour wine. You don't need power to pour beer, as long as it 
stays cold. We don't have to worry about keeping the stove lit. One of the weddings we 
had, horrible storm came through. It was the one that wiped out Middleburg. I think it 
was last year, last June. We lost power here and everybody had a blast. 
 
KS: Depending on how people take it, that can make it even more memorable and fun. 
 
[00:37:55] BG: The worst that happens to us when we lose power is you lose the ability 
to flush the toilets because we are on a pump. So you lose that, that's tough. 
 
KS: A situation could go down [They laugh.] 
 
[00:38:10] BG: Is there anything special about the way you dress as the tasting room 
manager, or do you carry anything with you all the time, is there essential tools for you to 
do your job? 
 
BG: My essential tool is a cell phone, business cards, and my name tag. 
KS: So they know you work here. They can reach you. 
[00:38:37] BG: I'm the only Bob here and that also makes it pretty darn simple. 
#virginiawine #virginia #localwine #wineindustry #panel #california #californiawine 
[00:38:42] KS: Which is unusual for someone named Bob to be the only one. [BG 
agrees.] What do you think has really changed about the Virginia wine industry. We talk 
about how much of a boom it's had in the last few years. 
 
#barns #thermalheater #vineyard #westcoast #eastcoast #heat #moisture #dryout #bugs 
#insects #pesticides #fungus #moisture 
 
BG: Well, uh. A couple of things. I had the pleasure of sitting on a panel several years 
ago, I'm going to say 4 years ago, 5 years ago, with a Women in the Workplace, it was a 
women's group, through the Chamber of Commerce. And they held it at one of the 
wineries, and they did a wine panel. They asked me to be there, and I’m not in the wine 
industry, I wasn't at the time, I was in the restaurant industry. But they had to do with the 
price of wine and the quality of it. And I asked the panel, I said, can I address that one? 
They said sure. I said, 1988, I came on board here. And prices were here and the quality 
line was down here. [BG gestures.] I said look at it today. Pricing structure has come 
down, and the quality has gone through the roof. Are we California yet? No, but how 
close are we. I mentioned earlier, we're 30 years ago where California was. That says a 
lot. And everybody is like, "you know, you're right”. Not only is it quality now, it's 
quantity. The number of different wines, and the number of cases of said different wines. 
We currently offer 22 different types of wine. That's pretty amazing. For an industry 
that's still considered young. So that's one of the most unique things, or amazing things 
I've seen, is the quality continuing to rise, and the pricing coming down. It takes a long

time to do it, because it's expensive to open up a winery. It takes a long time to get 
through the initial debt process. [00:40:43] And then techniques. Not just in wine- 
making. Taking care of the barns. The west coast is using a thermal heater right now in 
their vineyards to help control fungus and bugs. And we are using it right now. As of a 
month and a half ago, two months ago we were the only winery on the East coast that 
was trying this. And the wine-makers can address this better than I can. 
 
[00:41:13] KS: So it dries out the moisture in the air around them? 
 
#quantity #volume #juice #taste #pesticides #chemicals #gmo #nongmo #sustainable 
#sulfites 
 
BG: Exactly. It's the hot temperature. Kills the fungus, kills the bugs without damaging 
the vines. And it also appears to increase the amount of grapes and the volume of the 
juice that we're getting. So it's had a so far it's had a positive impact. Still haven’t gotten 
to the taste part. We still have to get the juice, we still have to make the wine, then we 
have to let it sit and try it. But right now it looks like a great way to go. 
 
[00:41:54] KS: I haven't heard of that. That's really interesting. [BG agrees.] So, that way 
you would have to use less or none of the chemical treatments for those things? 
 
BG: Exactly. 
 
KS: Which also can affect the taste, I'm sure. 
 
BG: We can be more non-GMO, more sustainable. 
 
[00:42:14] KS: Are people concerned about that, do you hear about that? 
#sulfites #sulfitefreewine #preservative #additive #bugs #pesticides #taste #color 
BG: They ask. I think one of the things that people have realized is that you can't get that. 
It's kinda like, can I get sulfite-free wine. Grapes have natural occurring sulfite in them. 
So there's going to be some. It's are you looking for additional additive sulfites. This can 
help control some of that, maybe. 
 
[00:42:44] KS: The sulfites are mostly added as a preservative. 
BG: That's a preservative, yeah. 
KS: Just to keep it from changing color, and going off taste. [00:42:51] 
 
BG: But this thermo thing is the steps prior to that, the bugs and the less pesticides.

KS: Which is huge. Screw-top or cork? 
[00:43:03] BG: Cork. 
KS: All corks here? 
BG: Correct, yes. 
[00:43:08] KS: And is it natural cork, or synthetic cork. 
 
BG: I think we are a mix of both. I think there is a little bit of synthetic. If there is, it's 
very little. 
 
[00:43:23] KS: And why is that? A lot of people are going to the screwtop now, and it 
seems to be less stigmatized than it used to be. 
 
[00:43:34] BG: I think that's wine-maker's choice. 
 
[00:43:40] KS: Hopefully after harvest I can sit down with the wine-maker and we can 
get into some more of the specifics. So I'll save those nitty-gritty questions for them. Let's 
see if there's anything else about...we were talking about the OK the thermal heater thing. 
Which is fascinating. First time I've heard of that. 22 different types of wine. What would 
you say is the showpiece wine that you make? What is the wine that is the star? 
 
#cabernetsauvignon #award #prize #peopleschoice #red #redwine 
 
[00:44:24] BG: Tough to say. We entered our Cabernet Sauvignon, it was a 2014 in a 
local contest and won the people's choice as the best red. We sell out of a lot of our 
wines. 
 
KS: You take that as a good indication! [both laugh.] 
#bauhaus #bauhausred #bauhauswhite #housewine 
BG: That's a good indication to selling wine. We've had to increase the amount of our 
what we consider entry-level wines but household favorites, the Bauhaus white and the 
Bauhaus red. We have increased the amount of those we make every year. I think we 
made 1770 cases of Bauhaus white this year. We might run out come February. 
 
[00:45:19] KS: Is it the least expensive wine, or is there is that part of the appeal? 
 
BG: I think it starts with the taste first. It's just very easy-to-drink wines. They are our 
least expensive also. But most of the clientele here is not price-purchasing. They're 
looking for something to drink. 
 
[BG has to leave to meet someone so they wrap up.]
