ANITA HACKETT, Diesel engine repair, Chapel Hill Transit 
Katy Clune  00:00 
It's Monday, May 17, 2021. We're here at the headquarters of Chapel Hill Transit. And I'm Katy Clune, 
here with Julia Gartrell. And Anita, why don't we start by having you just introduce yourself, and tell us 
what you do here. 
 
Anita Hackett  00:18 
My name is Anita Hackett and I am the first and only female for the town of Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill 
transit, I am a Mechanic One. I started off in the service lane, just changing oil, checking tires doing 
mostly preventive maintenance. And I been here since May 24, 2016. On the 24th will be my five-year 
anniversary. Since then, I, as I said, I'm a Mechanic One now. And I'm also a fill-in supervisor. So it's 
been some challenges, had a lot of doubts when people came and saw me. But I have proven myself 
over and over again. And it's an ongoing process, because they're not that many females in this field, 
especially in this town, in this unit here. But I love it here, though. It's very liberal town. I love my job. 
It's not a job to me; it's like, as I stated before, it's like being on a playground. And every day I get to 
play with my toys and my tools and my toys. So I love it, just fixing things. And it's something, it's a 
wonderful feeling to see something out on the road and say, " I fixed that. I did that."   
 
AH  01:52 
So, and to let other women know, it's, if this is what you want to do, don't let anybody deter you what 
you want to do in life, you know? So I am, I also will be 55 years old June 30. So it's never too late. And 
as I said, I started working here five years ago. But that's not where we started. It started, my interest 
started. My interest started in, my father was always trying to get to, you know, the backyard, ***  the 
tree mechanics. I *** don't know the name of anything, but I just knew.  I said, "Dad, that's not what's 
wrong with the car." Because I ,you know, that's not what's wrong with the car, Dad. That's not how it 
works. Why later on I found out that I had never met this man, my grandfather was a master mechanic. 
And there is a car that he built from the ground up. It's in some museum. I don't know where it is. His 
name was *** winged Hackett. So I did... I come from a long list of.... 
 
KC  03:05 
So that was your dad's dad?

AH  03:07 
Yeah, it was my dad's dad... 
 
KC  03:08 
...but his gift to your dad, somehow?  
 
AH  03:09 
Yes. My father was an office man. His brothers and sisters is.... the majority of the Hackett's on my 
father's side of the family like to work with their hands. I have a bricklayer, the woman that I'm named 
after (and she's been also in the paper) her name is Anita Marie Hackett *** ?Sterrett . She was the first 
female painter who had her own painting business in Baltimore City, Maryland. So and she was all 
about equal rights and women's rights and helping the underdog and.... 
 
KC  03:47 
So... her own painting business, like commercial? 
 
AH 03:51 
Yes. And she taught other women how to paint. 
 
KC 03:54 
And her relation to you again? 
 
AH  03:56 
That is my aunt. 
 
KC  03:58 
So another, a daughter of that, grandpa? 
 
AH  04:02 
afc2020009_017--Anita Hackett  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
- 3 - 
Yes. My father had 17 brothers and sisters. And as I've went to several funerals, a couple of friends of 
the family, "Whoa, the Hackett family's, very talented, very jack of all trades, but master of none..." I 
have a Uncle  Manual. He was a magician, but he also did interior/exterior work. So he worked, liked to 
work with his hands, too, and catering.  And the other one's *** mother, aunts were, one was a belly 
dancer. One is in the med--- two of 'em are in the medical field. And one of 'em worked for Social 
Security. When she was 18; she's retired now. 
 
KC  04:48 
Did you grow up with a sense that your aunt Anita was doing something kind of unusual? 
 
AH  04:53 
Yes. I grew up saying that. My father's parents made sure they were all independent. Okay? And I grew 
up with a father saying, I don't want you to *** didn't know anybody. So, and I was the only girl and the 
baby girl. And I have a brother, and my father also raised two of our, helped raise two of our cousins. So 
I was raised around a bunch of boys anyway, so I had to stick up for myself. So. But it's, my brother and 
I are just the opposite. He is a IT guy. He plays with computers; that's all he does. Don't play with car, 
you know. He played with cars when he was a kid, but he does not work on cars. And so... And it's just 
some type of way it clicked with me. I don't mind getting dirty. I like figuring things out. I wanna know 
how everything works, you know?  
 
AH  05:55 
So I just... and I got tired of, you know, how---I hate to say it---how most men treat women when we 
walk into the shop, like, they try to get over, or treat us like we don't know anything. So I didn't want to 
be in that predicament. And I didn't want to be in that situation. But I always want to know, "How does 
it work?" You know, you know the song The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round? Well, what else 
do they do? So it just clicked. And when I went to the service, I was a driver slash mechanic because we 
worked on our own vehicles, but that was just mostly kickin' the tires and, you know, your vehicle was 
your responsibility. And I got to be real close to the people in motor pool. And we went and I never had 
a shotgun, a partner, when I drove.

Was this pre-service, a job in Baltimore? 
 
AH  06:53 
No, this was in the service.  
 
KC  06:54 
Oh, OK. 
 
AH  06:57 
My.....what I went to school for was commercial art, graphic arts, reprographic arts and printing and 
photography. But I just found out that none of the people that went to school, well, we never wind up 
doing that, except for my brother, which is in computers. So when I went into service, I was in the 
United States Army; I was 16 Delta Hawk Missile crew member, which that's the  *** sifting unit to the 
Patriot, y'know, so we were on maneuvers. And, like I say, I didn't have anybody with me; it was just 
me. The missiles, the loader and the launcher. And the truck broke down. So if you're in the military, if 
you're driving at night, you're in blackout drive with these two little red little lights that shoot straight in 
the bumper, and only thing it is, only reason they're there is, just to let some... you see the person in front 
of you. Or the person sees your little red lights. That's it. No headlights, so basically drive in the dark. 
 
KC  07:59 
Where were you driving? 
 
AH  08:01 
We were, um.... I think we were in, in New Mexico. What are the training places in New Mexico? And 
the truck broke down. An' they drove by, and I was like ***  they're like, okay, we'll come back and get 
you. Like, okay, never again. I vowed that day to never have that truck break down on me again. So 
after that.... Yeah, they came back and got me, but I sat there in the dark and listen'd to everything that 
walked*** the crap by. They came back and got me, and I said, "Never again." And after that I became 
real good friends with people in motor pool, how things work, what happened, what I need to look for 
blah, blah, blah. After that.... I.... see... I was out. I got outta the service, and I was still in Texas. And I 
just got the first job that came along, which was H-E-B. It was grocery store in Texas, in Austin. And I 
afc2020009_017--Anita Hackett  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
- 5 - 
was not satisfied with that. So I went to a job fair. And they were looking for women in non-traditional 
roles. I was weighing the bags:  "Is anybody interested? Interested in careers in non-traditional roles?" I 
was like, sure, but what do you have, what you got in mind? Austin Fire Department is hiring for a 
mechanic. Really?? God was talking to me.  So, by luck, I got the job. I got the job, and I learned a lot. I 
love working on fire trucks.  
 
KC  09:44 
This is an Austin? 
 
AH  09:45 
This is an Austin, Texas. 
 
KC  09:47 
And how old are you at this point? 
 
AH  09:49 
Oh, I had to be in my 20s... 19...? It was..... It was in the 90s, because I got out in the 90s.  I loved it. 
Still  wasn't satisfied. I was still working as a temporary, but I was doing Mechanic Two, Mechanic 
Three work. And no, 
 
Julia Gatrell  10:16 
Sorry, could you describe: you said there's, like, different different levels?  
 
AH  10:19 
Yes, there's different levels.  
 
KC  10:20 
OK. 
 
AH  10:22 
afc2020009_017--Anita Hackett  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
- 6 - 
I was doing things like the brakes. A lotta I learned on the job and learned on the job in the military, too. 
'Cause, you know, it's not like we had a mechanic all the time, around. So....but I learned everything on 
his job. I learned how to change the pump packing, that's these little Teflon rings that  cool the shaft, that 
when it rotates, it pushes out the water. I learned about gauges, electrical everything. And the only 
reason I left there is because I could not become permanent, and I wanted to get paid for what I did. So 
for some odd reason, UPS popped up. So I went to go work for UPS worked temporary, that didn't work 
out. And then 9/11 hit, my grandfather passed away. I thought my brother was getting ready to go to 
Germany; he was also in the military. And my father told me I need to come home. I said, Okay.  
 
AH  11:27 
So I've done a lot of things in my life. I've also been an EMT paramedic. I worked at the hospital; I said, 
"Well, I want to do, I want to be a physical therapist." So. Like I said, my family, this guy said, the 
Hackett family's, jack of all trades, master of none. So I said, "I want to do this." Because when you're 
young, because I said never wanted to be stuck, whatever I did. I wanted to know everything. And that's 
what my mother used to tell me: "One day, you're want,  you're going to be old enough for your wants 
not to hurt you." I don't know how that is, but I still wanna learn stuff. Anyway.... So I became a 
physical, as a physical therapy aide. I paid through school on my own. I was a EMT. And I said, well, 
what's the next level? They said, well, paramedic. I said, "Well, I thought I have enough time in my field 
to become a paramedic." Oh, no, no, no, no. *** I do, I suppose you know. Yes. You know, I gotta got 
to school. I gotta do this?  
 
AH  12:36 
I said, "Well...." Then a week, a week later, well, I don' have enough money to go all the way to Towson 
[Maryland] to go to school. They said, "Well, we got, like, three more slots."  I said, "Really?" I said, 
"Well, how far is the class?" He said, "Walk out the door." He says, "See that third door right there, 
down the walkway?" He said, "That's where class is. They're gonna take it out your [pay]check." 
"Okay!" Oh, I'm para-medding. Mom, Mom gets sick, Mom passes away. And, and that threw me for a 
loop. And I was already working in the hospital. I saw death and everything around me anyway.   
 
KC  13:18 
Were you back in Baltimore? 
afc2020009_017--Anita Hackett  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
- 7 - 
 
AH  13:19 
Yes, I was back in Baltimore. And I saw death and everything. And even my father said, "I don't know 
how you do this every day." I said, "Dad  ***was my father wasn't managers. I said, "Dad, every day 
when you come into this hospital, you realize someone always  *** [microphone noise] has first off. 
And you count your blessings every day. Cuz I've saw, I've seen a lot. So.... 
 
JG  13:50 
Sounds like you're often in very high pressure situations. 
 
AH  13:54 
I guess so. I like working under pressure, though. Keeps you on your toes. 
 
JG  13:59 
Well, even that you're not working on cars or anything piddly like that. You're like fire trucks, like 
military vehicles, buses. Like they're all big. 
 
AH  14:09 
And they got to be right.  
 
JG  14:10 
And they have to be right, because they're serving people. 
 
AH  14:12 
Yes, definitely. So I was like, well, I did the li'l EMT thing and everything. I'm like, Well, I can't 
remember what happened after that. But mom passed away, and I had a little breakdown, and I had to 
get away, and my mother's family is originally from North Carolina. That's how I got down here. So I 
came to another funeral down here. My grandmother passed away, and I was down here, and I was 
about to certify as a paramedic, and because I wanted to be nationally certified. And North Carolina's 
only-- because I failed two stations  *** I told you my mother passed away, and my head wasn't in the 
afc2020009_017--Anita Hackett  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
- 8 - 
right place.  I said, "Well,  I'm going down North C'lina on my little vacation," and, and didn't actually 
certify.  
 
AH  15:01 
But at the same time my grandmother got sick. So I went to go visit her. And then she passed away. And 
for some reason, because I wasn't doin' too good in Baltimore, I needed  change.  said,  "I'm moving to 
North C'lina." "No, you're not!" "Yes, I am." I jus' picked up my stuff rolled down here. Another switch, 
I'm like, well, they weren't makin' enough money being a paramedic down here. So I'm like, you know, 
"I might hafta pay for myself!" And did all this on my own. So I said, well, so when I came down here 
to visit, I went out with this guy, and he was getting some shrubs for his [inaudible] at Home Depot. 
And it's like, I always like Home Depot.  
 
AH  15:48 
As I said, my family was in an interior/exterior, even though my father worked for the railroad, part 
time. We used to build the steps, tear out the slidin' glass doors an'  put slidin' glass doors in the house. 
He would change the flooring, like every other month. Yeah, seriously. And I said "Dad, we just did 
that."  Or we'd tear up the shrubs and we'd put up new stuff. An' my Uncle Manuel. He took one of those 
dollar houses in Baltimore, flipped it, and then moved overseas. Yeah, so... so, I always, like, you 
know... 
 
KC  16:29 
Yeah.  
 
AH  16:30 
I had to piddle with  somethin'. So after that, I said, "Well," I said, "Oh" So after I came back home, 
after, you know, visitin' my grandmother and everything, Home Depot called and said, "Yeah, we'd like 
to hire you. Would you like to come down here?" And I had to interview, and I moved down here the 
day of interview, at Home Depot.  
 
KC  16:56 
On the retail side? 
afc2020009_017--Anita Hackett  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
- 9 - 
 
AH  16:57 
 No, in the retail side in flooring. So I learned how to set tile. *** Perego, hardwood flooring, and then 
I'll became one of the top associates there. And only female there. You know, guys in the construction: 
"I can't get no help around here. Can I get some help?" And uh, you know, they go to a different 
department, and I heard my coworker, "Sir," because I told myself, "Be right with you. [whispering] I'm 
so sorry. I'll be right with you." And I heard my coworker said Sir, I can't help you." He said, "The best 
lady to talk to is that one right there, in flooring, right there."  
 
AH  17:42 
So I helped him out, and everything was hunky dory. I told him I said, "The same 'tention I gave that 
other lady I'm gonna to give to you what you need? I'm gonna set you in the right direction." So after 
that I was working at Home Depot, I taught the tile class, I taught the *** Perego class, I taught 
hardwood flooring, y'know, the weekend classes you see at Home Depot?  Then they have Home Depot 
University, an' taught that, too. So I left Home Depot ... [let's see] what happened after that? So I said, 
"Well, this, this ain't gonna do. It's not where I want to be." I said, "I like working on vehicles. I'm gonna 
learn about cars and trucks and stuff." 
 
AH  18:30 
Durham Area Transit Authority was hiring. So I started working at Durham Area Transit Authority. 
That didn't work out too well. And I got back into that again. And I was getting ready... I came over here 
jus' when this place got built, and *** Carl Rocos[?] was in charge. And, I think I was, like, one of, out 
of 35 applicants. I got into the top eight. But he said, "I gotta tell you somethin'." He says, "Not that I 
won't hire a female." He said, "I think you keep these guys on their toes, and you know, let them have a 
little bit pride in their work,"  he said, "But I have a new crew, and this is a new building, a new place." 
He said, "I want you to get more experience." I said "Okay." He said, "So go back to school." So I went 
back to school.  And, um, what with scholarships, everything, the whole caboodle....",  
 
KC  19:36 
What was that degree? 
 
afc2020009_017--Anita Hackett  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
- 10 - 
AH  19:37 
I have a Applied Science... Associates in Applied Science in Automotive. Automotive Technology. An' I 
was, like, "Okay." I said, "Well, I'll start off in automotive 'n' get my basics." I said, "I wanna work on 
trucks. I wanna work on big stuff." So I was, like, okay. So after years and years and years---well, not 
years and years---for some odd reason,  I missed a whole complete episode. I wanted to drive trucks, and 
I wanted to fix what I drove: big trucks, tractor trailers. So I went to go drive a tractor trailer. An' I was 
never home.  [inaudible] Some adversity happened to me again, but I didn't give up, I said  "Okay. Gotta 
change the tune, gotta do something new." So I did that. 
 
KC  20:37 
When were you doing the truck driving? 
 
AH  20:41 
From, like, it was it was after I left Durham Area Transit Authority, DATA.  Cuz around 2000 been 
driving for, like, about seven years. And one of my---I was s'posed to be a mentor. Cuz I got chosen by 
the top mentor the company, said, "I want to drive with me," he says, "so you can teach other women 
how to drive." I was, like, "Okay!"  That didn't work out. I stopped driving for *** swiff. And I drove 
for *** Avery, 'n' that didn' work out. And I was like, "Okay," I said, "But I still like big trucks." Big 
trucks are easier to work on than cars... for me. So. And one thing about trucks and, and buses, no matter 
what, they will always be on the road. Like I said, diesel was worth that. Because I wanted to get a 
career that was a career, not just a job. I knew that if I go work in the automotive field, because I'm a 
woman.  
 
AH  21:59 
And because I'm a woman of color, that it'd  be very, very hard for me. And then I would get, always get 
the lowest job on a totem pole. And most dealerships, or car shops are driven by commission. And I 
knew that *** I had to work real, real, real real REAL hard to get, to make that. Whew,  I mean 60,000 
70,000 [dollars.] I said, I know I was being realistic at, at a time frame. I'm very impatient for my goals. 
That's why I kept switching stuff. And I said, "Okay, I'm gonna do something else." So I went...so I 
went to ACC  [Alamance Community College]. *** left this area and with the right emailm *** because 
of love, and then I got in a relationship, and it was not, it didn't turn out very well. And I have a scar to 
afc2020009_017--Anita Hackett  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
- 11 - 
prove it. And I had to stay, was supposedly only stay six weeks in the domestic violence shelter, and I 
wanted to spend in seven months. And that was *** guide. Because I went to school with a broken arm. 
I walked 45 minutes to school with a load of books on my back.  
 
AH  23:21 
I was determined. I said if I don't finish, it means they win. And I've been told so many times: "You 
need to find yourself 'nother career. You don't need to be an old woman, don' need to be in no shop, and 
I'm like, "Nope, not gonna do that." I had my aunts, cuz they are all strong women on my father's side. 
And my Aunt Anita, I just *** get it because I talked to my Aunt Carmelita,  and she said, "You know, 
your aunt goes, went through the same thing you did, being in a man's field, because that's what she 
liked to do." An' I said,  "Well," I said, "I've done everything I'm supposed to do. I have lived my life to 
people sayin' how I'm supposed to live my life." I said, "Naw, I don't bother anybody." I said, "I just, I 
like playing with tools. I just do." Rather it'd be at Home Depot, or in a car, fixin' something. I like when 
I have a tool. I have a tool for this, I really I do. [Laughter] I do. and really, I mean, I really, I really, I'm 
addicted to tools. I really am. 
 
KC  24:40 
Everyone we talked to is, but you're the first to really own it. 
 
AH  24:44 
I own it, I own it, yeah. Yes, *** Snapple, I may, I should have been here last week, but I am getting to 
tools.  So I you know my aunt told me, she said, "If that's what you want to do, Anita, that's what you 
want to do." I said, "Mom's gone, dad's gone," I said, "You know, everybody passed away." I said, 
"Ev'body's almost gone. And I'm at [an age.... ] I should know what I want to do by now." I said, "This 
is it, this is what I'm gonna do, and I'm gonna finish it." So with my li'l broken arm, walking 45 minutes 
to class, as I went to ACC, and I left, I had like, less than a year to finish at Alamance Community 
College. At Alamance Community College I had less than a year. "Well, if you come move with me, 
you know, you'll have a car to drive and you'll have this..." I said, "You know, I don't know anybody 
rocking up."  "It's okay, as long as you know me...."  I'm like, "Okay. So I don't want to come be a 
burden. You know, I, I said, this is all I ask. Let me finish school, let me study, and I'm going to get a 
job.

JG  26:07 
You must've been in good shape! 
 
AH  26:57 
I had two jobs lined up, the day before my arm was broken, too.  I had a 19-hour core study. You all 
both went to school; I went to college. You know what that's like; that is a full-time job. School itself. I 
said, "But I'm gonna work it out some type of way." I had my Walmart lined up. And I called Bobby 
Murray Toyota, cuz everything was, like, 5-10 minutes from where I'll be staying. T§hey have no car 
though. But just in case I had to walk. So I was like, okay, cuz I always had that backup plan. That's 
why, you know, I did so many things. I always have a backup plan. So I'm like, Okay. So the day before, 
she called and said, "I want you to come tomorrow, and we're gonna talk about what you're gonna do 
Saturday." I was like, Okay! That didn't happen.  
 
AH  27:02 
So I went to still go speak to the supervisor. And she said, "Well, of course, you know, I can't let you on 
the floor with that." I said, "I know." "But I still had to talk to you face-to-face and let you know," she 
said. "When that cast come off, you come talk to me." I said, "Okay." Cast was off for, I think a week or 
two. I went to go see that lady. She said, "Yeah, by chance. I'm still looking for help." I was like, 
"Really?" So I got the job working part-time. I've went to Nash Community College and finished up my 
core studies. When I found out that, when I thought I was going to graduate, the courses were not the 
same as Alamance Community College; they should've been the same. So. God is good. Everybody, you 
know, the counselors: "You need to stay here and we can find you housing... " I say, "I don't know 
anybody here. The only thing I know is Alamance County. I'm going back where I started. I know I 
have, I'll have a place there." And so I came back. I had a deja vu moment. The same place that I moved 
out of, I moved back in. When I moved back. I had no transportation; I had a bicycle. I had to ride my 
bicycle for 45 minutes to go to *** Kaiser off, and I will never do this. I mean... 
 
AH  27:18 
 Well yes, I have gained weight since then!  I went to I was a boarder, a sock boarder.

KC  28:36 
A what? 
 
AH  28:37 
A sock boarder. You board socks. Yes, in a factory. Never done that before. Didn't wanna to do. But I 
did what I had to do. Yes, you board socks, and then you fold 'em and package 'em. And then,  boom!  
Instant Hanes socks. Yeah, yeah, that's what I did. Not so well. [whispers] I don't wanna do this no 
more. But my old, my former landlord, said to me that your place is not available, but my mother's place 
is available, but this lady's gonna remove out blah, blah, blah. I moved back here. After paying 
everything. I had $150 in my pocket. No job. But I got the job,  boarding socks. Ride my bicycle. She 
says, "Since, since, you know what, I know you be tryin'," and she said, "You cleaned up the house so 
well, and that lady left it a mess. Don't worry about paying the last little bit of rent." I said, "Okay." 
Mind you, I only had the date that I left Rocky Mount, that I had to leave Rocky Mount, [inaudible] 
"You can't stay here no longer." I said,  "Okay." 
 
AH  29:51 
 I still had three day days to spare. I spent three days sleeping in a U Haul truck with my two li'l dogs. 
*** So I, like I said, "Oh, well, we all know have you've stayed here you can't bring your d... I was like, 
"Okay, no problem. Thank you. It's okay." Now mind you, I was a truck driver. I know how to sleep on 
the road. I said, "Okay, we'll take a shower in there, *** are fresh sheets, you know, stay, where it's safe, 
you know, walk the dogs a l'il bit." And I was right, right up the street from the college, the *** seats. So 
I was familiar with these ***seats as 24 hours and said, "Wow, I've wasted about almost a day it's gonna 
take me, like, three or four hours to what knows about three hours to get to a destination. And you know, 
take my time and everything and just, I get to think... " So I slept in a U Haul truck with my, all my stuff 
in the back. And then the place was not even ready then, but then I moved back.  
 
AH  30:56 
So I left Grace Avenue, which was her mother's house. And I left the sock boarding place and work for 
Honda power equipment, which makes the lawn mowers, the tillers, snow blowers. The guy that moves 
in my house worked at Honda power equipment. The lady who trained me was friends with the guy. She 
said, "Anita, I want you to be a friend of mine, blah, blah, blah." And I already told Brenda, "You know, 
afc2020009_017--Anita Hackett  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
- 14 - 
I used to live right down there [inaudible] and we drove for like two weeks prior. And then when she 
said,  "I want to come over t' Cy's house." I went over t' Cy's house. I said, "Brenda, I used to live here, 
and you know how weird it is, moving into, knocking on the door of somewhere you used to live." Just 
like I always, "Come on in." Cy was moving. Cy did not tell my landlord he was moving. And I didn't 
know he didn't tell the landlord. So I just said, "Oh, by the way, you mind if I move back in t' place after 
Cy moves out?" She's like, "What?" I said, "Yeah." She's "Why, I didn't know that." I said, "Oh." She 
said, "Well, no, I don't mind." She said, "Okay." So I wind up movin'.  
 
AH  32:03 
This is my deja vu moment. I might wind up moving away from the same place I moved from. I got my 
truck back on th' road, because I did have a truck, which I fixed all through the automotive semester of 
putting the transmission back in. After my broken arm. So I've drove the truck back. But the truck wasn't 
ready. It's somethin' happened to the truck. That's why I had to ride my bicycle when I first got back. 
And after that, I said, "Well...." I still went to school, I went back to ACC and I spoke to my, to the 
director [of] automotive and he said.... I said, "You know, I'm a-finished." He said, he said, "I know." He 
said, "I spoke to Nash Community College," he said, "and I know you're not a quitter." He says, "Well, 
when you comin' back to class?" I said, "Next semester, if you'll have me." He said, "Of course." So I 
graduated from ACC.  
 
AH  33:12 
Now, even a year later, you know when you come to a job:  "Oh, we'll teach you everything you need to 
know!" But I didn't want them to teach me everything I need to know; I wanted to know everything. I 
wanted to know the book way; I wanted to know the proper way. And procedures. Because, like, as I 
told them at Durham Area Transit Authority, when they say we'll teach you everything you need to 
know, I don't want to be a parts changer. I want to know how it works. So that's why I went to school. 
And when I came here, I said, "I'm so a parts changer. I don't wanna be a parts changer. I need t' know 
why, and I want to say, 'yeah [unclear] replace that,', but, but why? What made, what made us come to 
this conclusion. Why do I have to take that off?'" Yeah, I was that little kid.  
 
AH  33:57 
afc2020009_017--Anita Hackett  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
- 15 - 
That is why I like to do so many things. I was the "Why IS the sky blue? But WHY? Well, how does it 
work?" So, after tryin' to prove myself here, I said "You know what? I'm not getting anywhere."  And 
that's, "Do you know what? I'm going to school." And they said,  "Well, what what can we do for you?"  
And I said, "I need two hours. I want, I need to get off two hours early." Because I was working from 
4pm to 12. And class started from 8 to 1. And I had to go to school in Jamestown [NC], the other 
Guilford Tech. I live in Graham, takes about a hour to get there. So if I have to go to school from 8 to 1, 
and I have to be here at 4, and I don't get off to 12:30 I at least need two hours. Because you know you 
aren't, you automatically just don't go home and go to sleep. I have t' to settle in, a little bit time t' study, 
little bit time t' eat. And I got two dogs to take care of. 
 
JG  35:05 
So this is when you'd already started 
 
AH  35:07 
Here  
 
JG  35:07 
Here. 
 
AH  35:08 
Yeah, but do you see the timeframe?  
 
JG  35:11 
Yeah, I mean, this is the, this is when you first started your [inaudible]? 
 
AH  35:14 
...when I first started here. I started working here in 2016? I think I graduated... 2017? Yeah, cuz I only 
had to have had like a, think, like, a year, year [unclear]  
 
JG  35:34 
Nice. So that... 
afc2020009_017--Anita Hackett  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
- 16 - 
 
AH  35:35 
No, no, then I went to Guilford Tech, I'm sorry. For... 
 
JG  35:38 
So you really have been everywhere, you weren't kidding. So then when you, you know, you started 
here, you were not totally satisfied, you kind of upped your skill level, were you then able to start doing 
more of the kind of challenging work that you wanted to do? 
 
AH  35:53 
Oh, yeah, oh yeah. Right now I mostly do, I diagnose a lot of *** Miller lights, check engine lights, 
basically anything that they, the drivers, write up.  
 
JG  36:04 
Yeah,  
 
AH  36:04 
Anything: tires, brakes...  Haven't taken out a engine; they don' want me to take out an engine, I guess... 
 
JG  36:11 
How many buses are part of the Chapel Hill transit fleet?  
 
AH  36:15 
*** I think we have, um .... [inaudible] somebody aksed me this before, and I actually had to... It's over 
100. We are the second largest transit fleet in North Carolina besides Charlotte.  
 
JG  36:30 
That's surprising. Why, why does Chapel Hill have so many buses?  
 
AH  36:35 
I don't know. 
afc2020009_017--Anita Hackett  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
- 17 - 
 
JG  36:35 
It's not that big... 
 
AH  36:36 
No, no. But we do service Hillsborough, Carrboro and UNC [University of North Carolina].  
 
JG  36:42 
Oh, that makes sense. So a bus comes in, it's having a problem. What's the *** cut? Can you walk us 
through how you approach it and what happens?  
 
AH  36:54 
Okay. Well, the bus comes in. Well, first of all, when I come in the door, that door you came in, and you 
saw the little windows? There's a little basket right there, and they'll have either a pink sheet or a yellow 
sheet. And then their drivers do a little write up. And then I just pick it up from there. Zach writes down 
a list, I get t' choose whatever I wanna do. And, um, say we got a *** milled light or he'll go, "Hey, 
Anita, I got a *** milk light." Or some days is, "Oh, we have a rood call." So that means I gotta go out 
on the road: bus broke down, bus jus' shut down didn't.... [makes sound of an alarm] warning lights 
making everything. So I go take my li'l laptop. I hook up to the bus, see what kind of codes there are in 
there and proceed from there. Codes don't tell you everything. I mean, it could've stopped because the 
fuel filter was stopped up. A couple of times I've had coolant leaks and bust your hose, or the water 
pump busted and was leaking. The belt split all apart. I have driven couple of flat tires. And, so.... 
 
JG  38:04 
So it seems like working on something on the road is a lot different because you're then dealing with the 
bus driver. The, the customers probably need a backup bus coming in.  
 
AH  38:16 
Yes.  
 
JG  38:17 
afc2020009_017--Anita Hackett  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
- 18 - 
Like you're kind of a hero. But also people are like, "Fix this immediately! 
 
AH  38:21 
No. No, the the customers are almost gone by that time or off the bus. Because we might switch buses 
out, because we gotta keep 'em rollling. Bus drivers sitting there waiting. And every time I roll up, I'm 
like, "You broke it. What did you do?" 
 
JG  38:39 
[inaudible] they appreciate that.  
 
AH  38:40 
Yeah, I always crack jokes with everybody. I say, "It's broken it. What are we gonna do?" *** Oh, wow, 
Where do they live? Oh, here she comes. You know, she don't ask them to keep telling you. I just made 
this place look pretty. I'm just gonna go [makes knocking sound] And they're goin', "No, *** did you 
find out find out what's going on? Because that's my thing. And I did get a good compliment from Zach. 
He said, "Even if you don't know what's wrong with it, you're going to find out what's wrong with it. 
And I trust that that bus, when I leave it out of the shop, and to fix it." Because on top of that, I inspect 
the buses. I give the safety inspections and everything. And it's been, in the very beginning: "Anita, don't 
shut down that bus." Because when I worked for Durham Area Transit Authority, they say the same 
thing. "We are short o' buses. Don't shut down that bus." I said, "I'm not letting *** it be loud to you.  
 
AH  40:43 
I said my name is on that same reputation. So is there's two things. Being a woman they don't expect you 
know anything. Three, it's a pride thing. If it's rolling out the Like you said, That's carrying people to 
work that is carrying somebody to the doctor's appointment, that is carrying somebody to go visit 
somebody, somebody whose mother, students are trying to go to school. Okay, everybody gotta be 
somewhere on time. If that bus breaks down, that's not good. As a bus rider myself when I lived in 
Baltimore, I know how it feels. And then here in North Carolina, it's not like you can go and get, 
because we don't have cabs that run like that here. So I know that you always like a C, you always have 
to have a backup. Now, from the time that I told you, all I had was a bicycle to drive where you ride to 
work. I wanted to have before I had four cars, I just sold my truck. And all three of them my work.

KC  40:56 
Tell me about the moment where you were promoted here. Or when you finally finished your degree, 
like, give me that, like, "Aha, I made it." 
 
AH  41:08 
Yeah, that was a "Aha *** " We got pictures of that. My brother drove all the way from Virginia and 
videotaped it. And he he  *** correct this on my phone, I have to say, he caught my face expressing 
"Exactly." And he made the little caps. I think he knew what I was thinking about. When I told you 
about my parents are gone; it's just my brother, and I, and I, and everybody's looking this way towards 
the stage. And I just happen to look up, looking for him. And I saw him smile, and he captured that 
exact moment. And when I was walking up the stage, and I *** didn't sit down like, "I did it! I really did 
it!" Like, "Oh," I said, "There's nowhere, I can't go no further now!" Unless I go get a Bachelor's. Gonna 
be somebody's boss. Nope. So I said, "We could go work for NASCAR if we wanted to, because they do 
have a NASCAR program. No, I think I'm gonna stay where I am. *** this can go on for that. I couldn't 
believe it. I mean, in my, because my head was down. I even told all my classmates, I'm like, "We did it, 
y'all!" ...I was like "Wow! *** I swear, I got a job. I got a job where I wanted to work at when I 
graduated from ACC, Alamance Community College. And I was,  he rode me, y'know, he was hard on 
me a little bit, Mark. And he, and I saw him about a week ago. And he said, just before I left, I think it 
was like, we're [gonna?] graduate. And I was in the office with all three of my instructors. And he said, 
"You know, it's gonna be hard for you." I said "Yai[sic]."  He said, and Jerry's, like, Yeah, it's gonna be 
hard for you." He said, "You wanna know why we rode you, and we've debated, and y'know, when you 
had a question, and I wouldn't give you that extra two points, and you debated us about this is the reason 
why this is this?" An' I was, like "Yeah, yeah," He said, "It's gonna be just like that where you're goin'." 
He says, "Gonna be Mechanic A, Mechanic B says this: who's right?" So. I says, like, "Yeah," "And the 
tests are set up like that, too." An' I said, "Okay." He said, "I did that....because you're a woman. It's 
gonna be harder for you. He's [says], "I'm gonna tell you three reasons. Because you're a woman, 
because of your age,  he said, "Because you're a woman of color." He said, "It's gonna be hard." He said, 
An' you're in the *** sell." An' I said, "Okay. No problem." He said, "I know." Because the day of 
graduation when I spoke to them again, he said, "What's wrong?" I said, "I'm nervous." I had gotten 
back to this job before I graduated. Right?

KC  44:26 
As Mechanic 1?  
 
AH  44:27 
Yes, I gradu-- No, no, as a service tech. Cuz I was little, cuz they wanted me to start at the bottom. An' I 
said "I'll start at the bottom," even though I was a Mechanic 1 before. And I started at th' bottom, but 
there was a little bit controversy, and I'll get to that in a minute. But. So I got the job here, because he 
wouldn't let me be a Mechanic 1, even though guys, after I got hired, knew less than what I did. And 
they became Mechanic 1. I said, "You hired them as a Mechanic 1, and all he did was work at, uh, what 
was it? In *** TW, doing tires. And he's a Mechanic 1? [I could tell?] everybody sort of was still 
frustrated every day, cuz it's just the way it is. I said you wanted me to be, I said, "And I have worked 
for Durham Area Transit Authority. And for Austin Fire Department on big vehicles. And I have to be a 
bus technician? Jus' do preventive maintenance? And then, a couple of times, I had to say, I am one of 
the few people, I want to learn something. Okay, I say, and I'm getting chastised. Because "Why don't 
you do this?" And I said, "I did." But I got this other [bus?] comin' right here. I said, "You chastise the 
supervisors not here no more." I said, "You chastise me because I was being aggressive and wanting to 
learn something else? And wh--? And I can do two things at one time?"  "Well, you need to go tell 
dispatch."  I said, "I'm not saying that's not my job, but that's not my position to go tell dispatch that I'm 
taking that bus. I think that's what you do. I know that bus is on the, that bus is in the yard, and I got this 
one doing this. I can do two things at one time." And then he got, he got straightened out. 
 
JG  46:28 
Do you feel like you've helped some people learn that you're able to be a mechanic despite being a lady? 
I say that jokingly.

Now that you have, you've finished school and you've proven yourself here, how did you earn that 
respect? 
 
AH  46:51 
I had to get to the *health club at times. Then Peter, the ones who you met cuz I--that's one thing, when I 
came in to interview, I did not bite my tongue. Because, as the saying goes, if you don't stand up for 
something, you'll fall for anything. And at that point, I need to stand up for myself. And it was that, "Oh, 
we welcome you, but we welcome you," type deal. And I fell into that, and not one of those people--I 
can pick up character pretty good. And as my Sergeant Major told me one day, and I have told this, from 
the top all th'way to the bottom: *** "Do not smile on my face and fist on my back and tell me it's 
raining." And then I had to say, "Do I, Iwill explain what I'm saying if you need me to."  "No, no." It's 
like, "Okay." And I'm, "Cuz  [inaudible] they need the bus to pass. That's the past, that, that but that's 
what women have to do every day is to prove themselves that they're not Silly Sally, not the typical 
blonde. And I tell people, if you knew your history, when a woman has to step into the role, of the 
leading role of doing something... World War Two.  All men were drafted. Men went overseas to fight. 
Women took over the factories. Okay? If a man came back from war, even now, recently. If when a 
man, when... if you're in the military--cuz I can do this prime example. When you're in the military, and 
the husband goes off, or the woman goes off, is one primary caregiver for the kids, for the household for 
everything? Especially for women, for women. You got your finances, you got to make plans, you gotta 
do future thing. If your husband goes to war and comes back as an amputee, or brain dead, brain injury, 
who's writing everything? I tell the guys this: "the first person that teaches, teaches you something is not 
your father; it's your mother. You need to respect women. You have to give them the benefit of doubt." I 
said,  "Women will always *** tired. I said, "But you cannot underestimate her; she is just not the baby 
maker. The one that makes peanut butter, jelly sandwiches, the one who cleans your house."  I said, "She 
is, she is your master teacher." I said, "And you can learn a lot from from a woman." And then they 
think about, "Oh, gosh, you're right! My mother did teach me so-and-so."  I said, "Whaz your father 
doin', working at, working all the time?" "Well, yeah.: I said, "The first person that taught you how t' 
talk; those were your first words. The first woman that taught you something, primarily was a teacher in 
school, was a woman, wasn't she?" "Well, yeah, you're right." I said,  "So what's the difference of me 
afc2020009_017--Anita Hackett  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
- 22 - 
flippin' a wrench and teaching you how to speak?" "Well, yeah, you're right."  So I mean, you know, so 
what, what's the difference? You know, it's like *** wheat. And women should give theirself more 
benefit about, you know. I've ran into this lady. I was at--cuz I love Dollar Tree [store]. An' I'm in 
uniform on. "What do you do?" I said, "I'm a diesel mechanic. And I'm proud, I'll wear this uniform, 
dirty, filthy, dirty, whatever." I said, "I'm a diesel mechanic, I wanted to learn about automotive, but my 
brother said, you know, he goes t' tell my teacher, and I said, "Um, I know plenty of women at a 
cashiers, been cashiers for years. I says, "This where you want to be?" "No." I said, "Is your brother 
going to pay your bills for the rest of your life? Is he gonna take care of you?" "No. I'm too old to go to 
school." I think at the time I say, "I'll be 50 in about three weeks." "Really?" I says, um, I says "You're 
not too old." I said, "I saw this guy. I was leaving my sociology class. And he had his books, and he was 
*** we own him, but we own them behind him. And he was a painter, and he was bent over. An' he had 
gray hair. You think he....too old to go t' school?" I said, "You're never too old to learn. Every day in this 
mechanics field you learn something.  Every day. In fact, every day, that's like, "Hey, Anita, I have this 
diesel particulate filter, pump that needs to be replaced." That's like, "Well, you know, I've never done 
that before. I'll give it a shot". He said, "Okay." He said, "Well." Then, afterwards, he said, and I didn't. 
He said, "See, you learn something new every day." I said, "Like yeah, I did." He??said "Wasn't that 
bad, was it?" I said, "Nope." So I don't mind learning.

afc2020009_017--Anita Hackett  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
- 23 - 
Okay, this I mean, since I am prior military, and yes, I do cuss like a sailor sometimes. And I used to be 
a truck driver. So I've been in a lotta male dominated fields. You need to believe in yourself. Believe in 
your dreams. And if I can walk--as you know, as the saying goes--as your parents: "I used to walk to 
school barefooted, you know, for  three miles go to school." Well, I walked to school, sleet, rain and 
snow, broken on. And I know that backpack, weighted at least 30, 30 pounds. Because, that one day that 
I was upset, and my instructor picked up my backpack. He said, "Oh, I now have mad respect for you. 
This thing is heavy." But in all, and the day that I showed up, when I didn't know the school was closed, 
and he was the only one there. He said, "Out of everybody in this classroom. I didn't expect you to be 
here." He said, "When we were closed."  He said, "I'll give you a ride back." So he said, "Wow." He said 
"You really want to do this, honestly." "Yeah, I do." I said, "Yeah, I do. This is all---" I said,  "I have 
done...." And the thing about the many things I haven't done, I have done everything I said I wanted to 
do. When I got out of the military, my First Sargeant said, "Well, what do you do now?"  "I'll be a 
physical therapist an' be a truck driver."  I'll be a paramedic." I dunno. I've done all that. This is the last 
thing I said I wanted to do.

Working with big vehicles? Because they said I couldn't.

So it's about doin' it just because you're not supposed to be there.  
 
AH  55:07 
Yup, I, I'm hard headed. Though when I had, I was working, underneath the table, and he was paying me 
WAY less than he paid these other two guys. And I made a mistake. First it was cuz I, it's hard for me to 
ask for help. And I made a mistake. But these other guys had made a mistake before. And he told me 
that I need to find another job. I need t' find something else to do. This is not my thing. So. I think about 
that every day when I, when I used, USED to get frustrated. No, this is where I need to be. I like wearing 
my boots every day. I like my rag hangin' out my pocket. I like my wrenches stickin' in my pocket. I 
afc2020009_017--Anita Hackett  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell

don't mind getting dirty. I still like to get my nails done or wear heels and look pretty, you know, things 
like that. But I love wearing my baseball caps every day, and I'm comfortable. This is my niche. You--
for women that want to get in the non-traditional roles, or don't know what they want to do with their 
life. You can do both. You can have kids. And you can flip wrenches. The group that I'm in, they have 
kids. In fact, one had their little girl underneath the car and sayin', "Oh, I'm getting 'em started young. I 
said, "That's right!"  Or they have little books for little girls, you know, 'bout cars an' stuff, or for little 
boys either. You know, and I don't knock it. It's not what you have, between your legs, or on your chest 
that makes you what you want to do in life. It's what you have inside. I--and as I used to say, I know I'm 
attractive. I'm well aware that I don't want you to look at me for what I look like before what I have 
inside. And that's what I had to tell a couple interviewers. I said, "I am more than capable of doing 
anything out myself." Cuz I still had, you know--most Latino men believe women should be at home. 
And I've had a couple of 'em. And a couple of 'em here when I became fill-in supervisor, they treated me 
a little differently. But now it's, "How ya doin', Anita? How're ya doin'?" When they found out that when 
they needed a tool---that nobody else had no tool 'cept me. Or Jason will go,  "Anita has that." Or, 
"Anita I have a *** light. And I tried to do this and do that. What did you do?" "Well, when did you 
reset it? If I recalibrate the such and such, and then try that out."

Do you have any particular---well, first of all, thank you for all the education you're giving these men. 
[laughter] 
 
AH  58:15 
It's not that hard! 
 
KC  58:17 
Just for all the women who encounter them later in life.... 
 
AH  58:22 
You have---I'll put it this way. When I went to that broken arm situation. And I was at a very, very, very 
low point in my life. She said," 'Nita, you have to have faith, you have to see the light at the end of the 
tunnel." And I balled up my fist and I went like this: "Do you see any light going through there?" I 
afc2020009_017--Anita Hackett  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
- 25 - 
said,"I don't see, I see, I don' see nothin'." And the counselor, the house mother, said, "All God ask was 
for the size of a mustard seed." And I tell people that are going through anything, rather be in a AA 
[Alcoholics Anonymous.] And they tell you, "Live one day at a time. If you can't live one day--this is 
with anything in life--if you can't live one day at a time, you live one hour at a time. You can't live one 
hour, live 15 minutes, half an hour, you can't live one 15 minutes, you live one minute. If you can't last 
for 60 seconds, then you live one moment at a time. As long as you can breathe in and out, you're gonna 
make it. Cuz as long as you get up every day, you have a chance, y'know. Whoever your higher power 
is, he gives you another day to get it right." So y'know, y'know you can beat yourself up and down and 
say, "Oh, I can't do it." Oh, yes, you can, because somebody else did it. And those days, I'm like, "Oh, 
it's right now, cuz I'm preachin' to the choir. I need to go take an automotive service excellence test, 
okay, so I can have that little pass. That is my goal is to be a master mechanic. And I failed that test. 
Think twice. Was too soon. Then I got a little riled up. And then I see other women and other people that 
have taken that test, and I'm like it--then they say in the book--"It's not a pass or fail, it's what you need 
to learn" Y'know, you need to work on. Okay. So Zachary told me: "So what are you going to do? You 
gon' carry 'round that book all time? You jus' gonna read it all day? When you gonna take that test? " I 
says, "Soon." He says, "What you waitin' on, Anita?  It's either you pass or you fail, and you take it 
again." So what I wanna tell women: "Believe in yourself, and the only thing that will stop you is fear, 
and yourself. So. Stomp out fear. The hardest thing you gotta do in life is wake up." 
 
KC  1:01:22 
That's for sure. Are there particular moments in your time here that you look back to and think of ,like, 
"Man, that was like, one really hard bus problem I fixed." Or say,  like, an anecdote you can share that 
helps give insight into what a day in the life of your work is? Or... 
 
AH  1:01:48 
I can tell you what one--but it wasn't here--but one of my supervisors, when I worked for--this is how I 
knew that, okay, yeah, I need to be in this field. When I worked on a fire truck. In order--we had to bust 
the tires down, you know--I'd take the axle out. And axle, with the little lug nuts--you know, little bolts--
lug nuts go all the way around the axle seal, and you pull it out. And it's like these little wedges in there. 
So you have to hit the center of it to pop the wedges out to take.... the hub, hub seal out. An' *** I have 
a-slingin' a 12-pound sledgehammer. That's only picture I have o' workin' there, of me doin' that. Cuz I 
afc2020009_017--Anita Hackett  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
- 26 - 
guess they couldn't "click, click." I say, "You better take a picture o' this! This is *** a graph in Austin." 
So. I was slingin' it an' slingin' it, and it wouldn't pop. Because when it pops, the little wedges come out, 
and the hub *** comes out. An' Buddy was standin' there in background. He's like--because I stood 
there; I was like [sigh], and I had my head down from anyone. He said, "I know that you are not gonna 
let the machine beat you." He said, "Go gather your thoughts. Take five minutes and get back at it." So 
that is my mantra for every day that I'm here. And that's what I tell people. I know you're not gonna--it's 
a machine! And I crack jokes. I say, "It was man made; a woman can fix it!". It's a machine. It was 
made. It's not no phenomenal [sic], or it's nothing magical about it. It's a machine. Put together by bolts, 
coupla  wires. It can be taken apart and put back together. It's a machine. 
 
KC  1:03:53 
It's that simple.  
 
KC  1:03:54 
It is that--I mean, you got to look at it that way. It's that simple. It's a machine. ou said earlier that 
working on big trucks and buses is easier than automobiles. Why's that? 
 
AH  1:04:11 
Okay, especially tractor trailers. You got more room. Okay? [inaudible] Cuz they're big stuff.  It's like a 
big Tonka [toy] truck.  
 
KC  1:04:28 
Easier to see and get in and move around? 
 
AH  1:04:29 
Easier to see, yeah. But for me, because I'm--I got low hanging--I can get in there, and most cars these 
days, you have your engine--cuz that was my next step. If I wasn't gonna stay this way. This is like, you 
know, "You can go become an engineer?" I'm like, 'Yeah, but I'd be inside all the time." I don't want to 
be inside. I like being inside outside. Engineers get a shape. And they're told, "We put everything in this 
shape. Don't worry about fixin' it." 
 
afc2020009_017--Anita Hackett  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
- 27 - 
JG  1:04:32 
Right, uh huh. They cause you some trouble. 
 
AH  1:04:43 
"Just put everything in, 'long as it works as it rolls out the door. Don't worry 'bout anything gettin'  broke 
down, having access to anything." And that's why a lot of mechanics do not like engineers. Because--it's 
especially one particular time he asked me, where did I go? *** There is a doser valve, which shoots out 
this fluid which burn--it's part of the emissions, which helps burn the nox, the nox emissions. And 
sometime it gets clogged. And if you get a code in a bus, they'll tell you, "Oh, this is below value." 
Okay. if you ever been on a bus, the *** backpacks, you lift up that seat. Okay? This is the engine right 
here. First of all, you gotta get the seat up, for one; this is shaped this way. That slips that way the hatch 
is this way. Pull it up, drop it there. This part was underneath me here. So I had to lay on my back. I 
could not see what I was doing. Why manipulate to get it off. But I got it. And I haven't ever done 
before. I was, like,  "Why get comfortable, because I think I'm getting vertical [vertigo] now, get a little 
dizzy, if I'm gonna completely flex. I *** league executed nice and cushiony. Because I got everything 
in my pocket and take off. And I literally had to get it like this. And then after I did this Zach's, like, 
"You know, I didn't want to tell you cuz you were never very good anyway," he said, "But you know 
how I get it? Cuz my hands can't get up there." He said, I dunno how you got that." I said, "Well, I, 
y'know there's three parts we look at." He said, "For me, I had to take the exhaust pipe off, turn, it then 
get it out." I was like, "Oh. That's too much work." And I am one of those, I work smart now. 
 
JG  1:04:45 
Yeah. 
 
AH  1:06:11 
That's why I tell people , "It ain't that hard. You gotta look at it and go, "I ain't takin' all that off. And 
how long is it gonna take me to take it off? Is it worth my time?" And then I have the, the mind concept 
as they work in a dealership, cuz they workin' against the clock. So, that's how I do things,  like *** I 
lost Or if we have a list of buses, he's  [says] "Whaddya  wanna take?" I'm like, "What's going to be easy 
first, cuz I know if I get that *** mill light, or that check engine light is gonna take me longer. Because 
it might go into somethin' else. But I know I gotta just go to the light--and it's a couple of times it 
afc2020009_017--Anita Hackett  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
- 28 - 
backfired on me--like, if I was a light bulb *** It was a couple of wires they got burnt out and the fuse is 
the harness[?] is burned. Everything. Yeah. I went into that, so... It's.. 
 
KC  1:08:19 
Do mechanics ever argue over who gets what ticket, like... 
 
AH  1:08:24 
Not here. [crosstalk] Not here. Oh, yeah. A coupla times, y'know, they'll get.... "Oh, you wanna get the 
easy one, huh?" Cuz a coupla, you know? And maybe you're working too fast. 
 
KC  1:08:42 
I mean, you were saying earlier that one of the reasons this job appealed to you--it sounded, like, to me--
is you thought it might be more fair than, like, a private auto shop 
 
AH  1:08:53 
Yeah. Two reasons why I wanted to work for fleet. Especially in today's economy and the pandemic and 
everything and with people out of work. I needed something, I don't want to say foolproof. I wanted my 
check to be consistent, okay? There's a couple of the guys who worked in car dealerships here, my 
supervisor one of them. Which--I was like, "Why is she calling me?"  I said, "I know you were making a 
lot of money at Honda." He said at one time he was. And then it dropped off. If the work's not there, you 
don't get paid. So. *** why don't little minor stuff, busy work. But I knew that if I work for fleet, or I 
work for a organization, the state, the county or whatever, that I would have job security. That's why I 
wanted to drive trucks. That's why I wanted to work on trucks. That's what--fire, fire trucks are never 
going to go out, okay? Cars will always be here no matter what. This is another reason I wanted the 
mechanical field. No matter what, people always have to get somewhere. Transportation--besides the 
healthcare field--and healthcare field will burn you out. And I was having back-to-back deaths. I mean, 
like I told her, [inaudible] said,  "Why you be here, in here, for what, seven years, somethin' like that?" I 
said, "Yeah, something like that." They said, "Why'd you leave?" I said, "Because it will always be 
there. No matter what I can always do that." I was at a certain age, I knew I had a certain time span. I 
said, "I better do this while I can.". And so

- 29 - 
KC  1:10:49 
The third of you that likes the service aspect of this work, too?  Like coming from a military 
background, like servicing the fleet for the town of Chapel Hill, that sort of public service aspect? 
 
AH  1:11:04 
That's what I enjoyed about working on the fire trucks, y'know. *** I say certain part of me that 
sometimes I don't look at it, cuz some people asked, "Well, why did you ***...?" I said,  "Because I'm 
still doing a service. I'm still a Austin Fire Department maintenance facility. I worked on my truck, or 
worked on a launcher loader when I was in the service, and I was missle, y'know, the, a crew member. 
Firstly, I thought it would be like a team thing. And then I got one of my little moments. I said, "If all 
fails,"--because my father said never depend on anybody. But y'know, I feel like *** always depend on 
yourself. This is the one field that only one person can hold that wrench at a time. I got a big wrench. I 
got a big wrench! It's a it's a couple of times that I've turned down *** by row "Here, here. Let me help 
you with that."  "I got it! I got it! I do." Cuz even in school: "Well, Anita,  let me help you with that." I 
said, I said, "When I get my job, you're not gonna be there every day." I said, "What about those days if 
you don't show up? To work? Who's gonna help me then?" They went. And Zach and I had that 
conversation, too. He said, "I always fiddle around with for a while..."  He, and he, an' this. That's what I 
like about him, cuz he don't care if you black, white female, as long as you work. And he said, "If I tell 
you how to fix it, how're you gonna learn anything?"  I said, "Well, I'll holler at you when I get stuck." 
And the majority of times when I holler at somebody, I'm just asking you, "Am I on the right track?" 
"Yeah, you got it." And I'm like, "Okay, you sure?" He says, "Anita, I know you didn't have it or you 
wouldn't be working here." I'm like, "Yeah, that's true." I tell you, I don't know anything, though. I tell 
everybody that: "I don't know anything!"  Cuz I might *** want you to all: "There she go! There she 
go!" I'm like [inaludible]. "She's--that's the hardest-working woman in transit." I say, "I don't know 
nuthin'. I just make this look good. He's telling you all that. I'm just playin'" It isn't--it's not.... And 
somebody also told me, "If you enjoy what you do, it is not a job." My brother asks me: "How old are 
you? How old is the oldest mechanic where you work at?" I say, "I dunno. 60?70?" But they halfway 
broke down, you know. They're doing less and less every day. I said, "But I'm not gonna be that person." 
And I've told them that. I'm not gonna be that person that *** be grumpy every day. I said, "If I'm 
grumpy everyday when I come to work, I need to find another job."

- 30 - 
JG  1:14:16 
That's okay. 
 
AH  1:14:27 
That's okay. I'm not going to be that person of, "I was this, want this job because of my insurance." 
Believe me, I say jobs I didn' have insurance. So. My thing is for anybody, and my old instructor told 
me, "So I want come back and talk to these people?" I'm like, "Okay."  
 
AH  1:14:34 
"Enjoy what you do. Have a backup. Have a backup for the backup." Like I said, I have several cars 
now. "Why do you have three cars?" I said, "Because in North Carolina. It's not like public 
transitportation is everywhere." I said, "And I learned living in North Carolina, you have to have a 
backup for the backup. Especially if you live in the country. So. Plus one runs out gas—especially since 
the gas went down! [chatter and laughter about recent gas shortage on East Coast.]  
 
JG  1:14:58 
As we, you know, this has been fascinating and I love hearing sort of all the ways that your various 
interests came together. A question that we have been asking everyone is—as a self proclaimed tool 
junkie, I imagine you'll have a good answer, what is your favorite tool that you work with? Or can you 
even pick one? 
 
KC  1:15:14 
Today. [Favorite tool for today.] 
 
AH  1:15:17 
My favorite tool that I always carry is in my pocket. I carry a couple things in my pocket. This is a 
driver on one side and a ratchet on the other side. Zack says I have too many things in my pocket, I 
always have—uh, oh, where is it? [digging in pocket] My wrench. Oh, there it is.  
 
1:15:41 
[Transit employee pokes head into office, explains did not recieve email to print form, says goodbye.] 
afc2020009_017--Anita Hackett  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
- 31 - 
 
AH  1:16:02 
1:17: 00 My favorite tool is my DeWalt impact driver. My drill driver. I use that a lot. Or my... 
 
KC  1:17:05 
Why do you keep this one in your pocket all the time? 
 
AH  1:17:08 
Number one, this will hold sockets. This holds a quarter inch, and I have an adapter, this will hold three 
eighths if I need it to. Plus I have my screwdrivers in my other pocket. But if I get in the close quarters, 
this becomes a screwdriver. [metal popping sound] I love gadgets.  
 
KC  1:17:32 
So you are prepared for almost anything.  
 
AH  1:17:45 
Yeah.  
 
JG  1:17:46 
We'll keep you on our post-apocolypse team.  
 
AH  1:17:52 
[Laughter] He [Zack] said, "You got too much stuff in your pocket." But if Zack and I are working close 
together.. "Anita, you got that wrench? You got that wrench on you?"  
 
JG  1:18:11 
Oh he's never prepared? 
 
AH  1:18:15 
afc2020009_017--Anita Hackett  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
- 32 - 
[Pulls out another tool & comments, hard to decipher] I have too much stuff in my pocket. And sadly, I 
don't have it on right now. I usually add my snap on. It's a necklace, and goes this way, or that way. But 
since I work in dark all the time. I always say this blade on me too. [laughter] 
 
JG  1:18:50 
You're like Inspector Gadget! 
 
AH  1:18:54 
That's what they call me. And I used to have a flashlight here because batteries always go out. One of 
them is a USB. But I told you, I like tools.  
 
JG  1:19:08 
Youu can't pick a favorite. It's been so nice talking to you. Is there anything else that you want to make 
sure we have on tape?  
 
AH  1:19:17 
I know I have went all the way around Robin Hood's barn and that is the Reader's Digest version of the 
Anita Hackett story. But— 
 
KC  1:19:26 
My last question is just to ask you if you had any other any specific memories of being a kid and 
showing your proclivity for fixing things, and putting things back together if there's any like, specific 
memory? Because it sounds like the Hacketts were an incredible family. So just sort of like looking back 
on those Baltimore days...? 
 
AH  1:19:55 
Originally—and that's whyI said I worked for Home Depot—originally I wanted to be a carpenter. But I 
knew that knew the job market go up and down. And when I went to ACC he said, "Well, you know, the 
housing market is down.  You will only be a framer." But like I said, I did not want to be stuck. I 
multitask. This has always turned in. I've always walking doing something. In fact, somebody said, 
"You're always moving."  I said I know. It's not that I'm running out of time, but I like to be productive. 
afc2020009_017--Anita Hackett  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
- 33 - 
And the one reason why another reason I got in [steel? deisel?] is because you can see the end result of 
your productivity. Like I said, they said, "You work too much." Or I'm a workaholic. I just like to see, 
like, things made. I would have been in manufacturing, but like I said, I can't be stuck in one place. Oh, 
no. I've got to see the sunshine. You know, working outside. A lot of times, if I can do—instead of 
driving that bus into the shop—I'll do it right on the lot. I'll get my impact driver and my tools and do it 
right on the parking lot.  
 
KC  1:21:37 
Can we take a peek at the shop?  
 
AH  1:21:40 
Sure can! 
 
KC  1:21:41 
Alright! I'll turn this off. Thank you so much.
