To PASTOR'S— The Eccentric and Versatile Come-
dian, Harry Osborne, and the charming and gifted Fanny 
Wentworth have been one of the principal attractions at 
this Theatre for the past week ; Harry Osborne's imper-
sonation of .the eccentric English lover was a 
fee ture in 
their entertainment, and his change from that to a 
neat, 
witty, humorous though ba.hful Irish lad was simply 
wonderful, while the charming little Lady Fanny Went-
worth particularly delighted her hearers with her sweet 
Irish brogue, her rich Irish voice, her merry laugh, her 
flow of mother wit, and with all her extreme refinement. 
In short, they are the most clever and refined Artists that 
ever adorned the Variety Stage.—aening Telegram. 
HOWARD ATHENEUM, Boston.— Harry Osborne and 
Fanny Wentworth were seen last night in a 
beautiful 
sketch, entitled " Lad and Lass from Ireland," in which 
they displayed a 
profusion of that cute mother wit pecu-
liar to the Irish race, which drew forth peals of laughter 
from the entire house. 
Their singing was good; they are 
the best in their line we ever saw.—Boston Herald. 
CADEMY OF Music, Chicago.—Harry Osborne and 
Fanny Wentworth are the most natural and truly refilled 
representatives of Irish character that ever appeared be-
fore the public of this city. 
Their ready wit, sparkling 
merriment, and out-bursts of silvery-ringing laughter, to-
gether with the innocence and simplicity of the character 
of their representations, inspire the audience with the 
comfortable feeling of being at home.— Chicago Times. 
THE THEATRE COMRZUE, St. Louis.—The bright and 
particular stars this week at the Cornique are Harry Os.

borne and Fanny Wentworth—the inimitable artistic 
personators of Irish Character. Besides being the equal of 
any artists that ever appeared in St. Louis, they possess so 
much of that true originality so seldom seen and always 
sought after by the pleasure-seeking public. 
The audi-
ence taxed the accomplished little couple last night severe-
ly, calling them out until they must have been exhausted, 
and each time the response to the call was greeted with 
hearty applause. They are fully the equal of Mr. and Mrs. 
Florence, or any other actor or actress on the Arnerican. 
Stage.—St. Louis Globe. 
GRAND CENTRAL THEATRE, Philadelphia.—Harry Os-
borne, the truly interesting eccentric young Comedian, and 
the highly accomplished little Artist, Fanny Wentworth, 
who have been the attractive feature of the Central this 
week, have closed their engagement and gone to Provi-
dence. The admirers of fine artistic acting in Providence 
will be delighted with these mirth-provoking performers, 
they are both so good and original and Miss Fanny especi-
ally delights the audience with her fine presence, sweet 
voice, and graceful movements.—Philadelphia Item.

THE POOR OPPRESSED IN IRELAND. 
Sung by HARRY OSBORNE and FANNY W ENTWORTH with great 
success. 
FATHER. 
DEAR isle of fame and beauty, thy shores have long been trod 
With savage tyrants' footsteps! 
Oh, 'tis sad! 
Thy faithful sons, dear Erin, are banished from thy sod, 
Their homes destroyed, they are dispossessed of all! 
We leave the dear old cottage that once we called our own; 
The cursed intruders' minds are satisfied! 
They have caused the young to exile and the old to be forlorn 
On the roadside here we lay our heads to die! 
[Daughter discovers old man at work.] 
DAUGHTER. 
Oh, father, dearest father, you are growing old, I 
see, 
You cannot do that work there all alone, 
And when I 
marry Teddy, oh, father, he will be 
A 
great help on the farm and in our home. 
His heart is stout and bold, the cares of life will not wear 
A 
haggard look upon my darling Ted. 
Can I 
be his wife now, father ? for to me he is so fair; 
Your refusal, father dear, I 
almost dread! 
FATHER. 
Oh, Norah, with a 
blessing I 
hope the sunshine's rays 
May ever shine upon you and your Ted; 
I 
hope you'll thrive and prosper like the blooming flowers in 
May; 
You'll remember this, my blessing, when I'm dead. 
Go tell the news to Teddy, that your father gave consent, 
And tell him that he is free to name the day; 
But let Ifim seek another land, for he cannot earn the rent! 
Sure, he'll find a 
home in dear America

THE GREAT ST. PATRICK'S DAY, 
Words by HARRY OSBORNE. 
Air.—Emancipation Day. 
OLD IRELAND iS our country. 
God send her liberty. 
All of that glorious nation now are exiled far from thee, 
But freedom's dawn will some day come, 
At least, we trust and pray that in our Isle we'll celebrate 
A 
victorious Patrick's Day. 
CHORUS. 
With Harp and Shamrock bright, 
We'll make a 
glorious sight. 
That emblem once unfurled takes the sway, 
We'll join both heart and hand, 
Then no tyrant dare disband 
The Sons of Erin's Isle on St. Patrick's Day. 
All honor to the loyal men we mean to mention yet, 
O'Mahony, O'Connell, and the patriot Emmet; 
Their names shall last forever, lit with the golden ray, 
Their shadows mingle with us on 
Our great St. Patrick's Day. 
With Harp and Shamrock, etc.

NEWBURGH TOWN, 
Words by HARRY OSBORNE. 
Sung by FANNY W ENTWORTH. 
Air.— You have been a 
friend to me. 
FAREWELL unto the dear old home where dwelleth peace 
and rest, 
Ancient Newburgh, fare thee well, whom Nature boun-
teous blest. 
When youth and vigor braved the storm I 
trod thy shady 
bowers, 
There, with my first companions, I 
spent my happiest 
hours. 
C2ORUS. 
Though I 
have roamed far from thee now, 
To face a 
world of strife, 
My fondest hopes shall flee to thee 
All through this busy life. 
My mother too, so tender, has missed me—still I 
roam, 
And all is dark and dreary now around that dear old 
home. 
Yet, if I 
prosper e'er in life, to God I 
trust and pray 
1 
shall return in happiness—oh, for that happy day! 
CHORUS. 
My future in oblivion lies 
On the bleak world's ebbing sea, 
Yet still at times in fancies muse 
I 
once more gaze on thee. 
In yon dear homi, fond memory dwells lit up with gold-
en rays. 
In dreamy thoughts I 
often see the dawn of briehter days. 
It is reality at last, I 
approach the cottage door— 
It opens—Yes there are tears of joy, and smiles forever-
more. 
CHORUS. 
My dear old mother shed a 
tear, 
And welcomed me with joy, 
Then with a 
fervent prayer to God 
She blessed her only boy.

left the dear old cove of Cork, 
And crossed the briny sea 
A 
little fortune for to make 
In sweet America. 
Through ups and downs we'll labor hard 
To buy a 
little farm, you see, 
So now we're happy gra-ma-chree, 
As king or queen could ever be. 
CHORUS. 
With step so light and heart so free, 
Now singing, dancing, full of glee. 
America, extend your hand 
To this Lad and Lass from Ireland. 
We'll ne'er forget our Native Land, 
Although we are far away; 
We honor it just once a 
year, 
On dear St. Patrick's Day; 
Oh! then the fifes and drums are beat, 
We're full of fun, and mirth must be 
Their sounding praise in every clime, 
For the pretty Island in the sea. 
With step so light, etc.

Music by CHAS. THATCHER. 
Sung by HARRY OSBORNE and FANNY W ENTWORTH. 
IIIIRRAII for dear old Ireland! 
That diamond in the sea. 
We drowned our sorrow, dance and sing, 
Sure we're always full of glee. 
We've heard of other countries, 
Of climes so rich and rare, 
But there cannot be a 
happier home 
Than sweet sunny Kildare. 
CHORUS. 
The dear land of our fathers, 
We are longing to be there, 
To see the Sun-burst rising 
On thy green hills, Kildare. 
The little sprig of Shamrock, 
It proves but one in three, 
Springing from dear Erin's soil, 
That plant of liberty. 
St. Patrick, he revered it, 
So let this be our prayer, 
That the emblem of our country 
May wave triumphant in the air. 
CHORUS. 
The dear land of our fathers, 
We are longing to be there, 
To see again the emerald hills 
\ Of our native home, Kildare.

WAIF OF THE CITY, 
Composed and sung by DAVID ROCHE. 
THESE lines are founded on the real circumstance of a 
poor news boy who upon one terrible winter's night bare-
foot, hungry, homeless, and alone died in the street. 
Oii ! where is that sad cry, that piteous wailing ! 
As the fierce, howling wind whistles terrific strong. 
'Tis a 
cold winter's night—frost nipping, hailing. 
Ah ! a 
sweet voice cried " pity! " Yes, sure this is wrong, 
For far in the distance of a 
dark clodded city, 
Through the gloom of the night I 
now plainly see 
The form of a 
poor ragged child craving pity, 
But alas! death was certain and life must soon nee. 
Cnouus. 
If you have not the heart of a 
stone, oh, do pity ! 
Give forth a 
small mite, and never say nay, 
Remember the poor ragged waif of the city, 
And God with a 
blessing is sure to repay. 
Poor child of this cold world, thy home is not here ; 
No one on earth hast thou to love, 
No one to claim thee or yet shed a 
tear, 
Bat—the Father of all, our great Ruler above— 
Oh God! can it be that 'mid so many beings 
A 
poor, friendless creature cast in the storm 
Should starve in the city, without care or pity, 
Receive the pure soul, it has fled this bright morn. 
If you have not, etc. -

TWO THOROUGHBREDS FROM IRELAND 
Composed and sung with great success by ITARRY OSBORNE 
and FANNY W 
ENTWORTII. 
On here we are two thoroughbreds, 
From Ireland all the way, 
Weleft -bat snarkling little isle, 
Her brooks and winding bays; 
Wc'1, ne'er forget the shamrock green 
That grows upon thy shore, 
Not if centuries'thy freedom should restore. 
C [Tortes. 
Machree, Machree, we long to see the day, 
Asthore, Asthore, the enemy to slay, 
And plant the flag of freedom 
With harp and shamrock bright, 
While we are marching to the fight boys. 
That was a 
glorious day of the patriots whose names 
Should emblazon every honored roll 
With glory and with fame; 
They are rescued from the tyrant's grip, 
Australia's fettered chains, 
So hurrah for the gallant boys, the Fenians. 
CHORUS. 
March on, March on, 
One victory is won; 
And yet we'll have that dear green Isla 
Restored to freedom's sons, 
This work we hope will soon be done. 
EMMET'S NO MORE. 
By HARRY OSBORNE. 
Sung with great success by FANNY 
W ENTWORTH. 
AIR: Exile of Erin. 
Despair in her wild eye, a 
daughter of Erin 
Appeared on the chit of a 
bleak rocky share, 
Loose in th wind flowed her dark streaming ringlets, 
As heedless she gazed on the dread surges' roar. 
Loud rang her harp in 
tones so despairing, 
The tune passed away with the present comparing, 
And in soul-thrilling strains deeper sorrow declaring, 
She sang Erin's wrongs, or my Emmet's no more. 
Oh Erin, my country, thy glory's departed, 
For tyrant's and traitors have stabbed thy heart's core, 
Thy daugbter's now leave in the streams of affliction, 
Thy patriots are fled or lie stretched in their gore. 
Ruthless ruffians now prowl in thy hamlets forsaken, 
And from pale hungry orphans their morsel have taken, 
Yet the screams of thy females no pity awaken, 
Alas, my poor country, thy Emmet's no more. 
Brave was his spirit, yet mild as the brahmin, 
His heart bled in anguish at the wrongs of the poor, 
To relieve their had sufferings he braved every danger, 
The vengeance of tyrants undauntedly bore. 
Even before him the proud titled villains in power 
Were seen, though in ermine, in terror to cower, 
But alas he is gone, he has fallen a 
young flower, 
They have murdered my Emmet, my Emmet's no mAre , 
Composed by HARRY OSBORNE and sung with great success by 
FANNY W ENTWORTH. 
Oh, how often my mind retraces joy past, 
When childhood and youth knew no care, 
How I 
rambled with Kate, the pride of Newlae, 
Plucking wild flowers to wreath in her hair. 
How oft did our playmates stare at us and prate, 
In that ancient old town near the mill, 
When returning from rambles witb beautiful Kate. 
Seeing her home to that cot at the hill, 
I 
remember how often her eyes they would beam, 
When I'd tell her a 
sweet tale of love, 
How my mind was enraptured with youth's happy dream, 
Oh how blest by our ruler above, 
Then oh shall we part from each other at last. 
Leave that love we bear fade with will; 
Oh no I 
would seek for to moulder and pass

grave at the foot of yon hill

are two funny characters, 
And the same you NVii I 
allow, 
You will always find us tippling, 
And the last ones in a 
row: 
But when our Irish blood gets hot, 
And we pull the cobeen o'er our face, 
You hear them quickly calling out, 
Let them alone for they are no brace. 
Ctioans. 
We are two ilacint people, 
We stand as stra:.L and firm 
As a 
wall or a 
church steeple 
That no one can overthrow; 
So we are known by every one 
As two devils from below. 
Sure we are in for every party, 
Raffles, fairs, or wakes, 
And if there's any one too hearty, 
You can bet their pie is baked; 
For people look and stare at us, 
And say do now squeel low, 
For there at McGuffin's party 
Goes, them devils from below. 
We are two, tEc.

Maggie darling, now, good bye, 
To America I 
go; 
It will nearly break my heart to leave you, 
And still I 
cannot live here so. 
I 
will nearly break my heart to leave you, 
Yet I 
must from old Ireland go. 
The old folks they are growing grey Maggie, 
The farm it wont support us all, 
I 
cannot stay and see them suffer, 
So I 
must go where duty calls. 
CHORRS, 
Maggie, dear Maggie dear, 
Oh ! should I 
never see thee more, 
My fondest hope is that you love me, 
When you've loft old Ireland shore. 
Barney what will come of me 
When you are gone far, o'er ,the Main ? 
The birds will only sing- 
in sadness, 
The sun wii, ne'er shine bright again: 
The birds will only sing in sadness, 
Till Barney conies back home again. 
Maggie, Barney feels ' tis hard to part, 
To leave his home and country too, 
But times are getting hard here, Maggie, 
And I 
must now ffnd work to do.

WHERE CAN MY LITTLE BROTHEB BE? 
Where can my little orother be 
Why ever did he stray ? 
His loss has been a 
blow to me, 
I'll hope he'll stay away; 
To bring him back, my love is such, 
I 
must some plan devise, 
My grief is when I 
think how 11111Cil 
'Twill cost to advertise. 
CHORUS. 
Where can my little brother be ? 
Can he have gone away, 
To study hard at Botany, 
Afar in Botany Bay? 
He's six feet high and very lean, 
His length's his chiefest charm, 
His boots are twelves, his gloves sixteens, 
He's tatoo'd on his arm; 
His face a 
noble cast was deem'd, 
A 
cast his optics bore, 
His Roman nose turn'cl up, and seem'd 
To say Excelsior. 
CHORUS. 
Where can my little brother be ? 
Why ever did he stray ? 
His loss has been a 
blow to me, 
I'll hope he'll stay away, 
'Twas doubtful when I 
saw him, for 
His form was faint and dim; 
You could not quite be sure which was 
His shadow, which was him; 
His legs were like the pelican's, 
So tall he seemed indeed, 
With graceful neck, long as the swan's, 
A 
hop pole run to seed. 
Where can, etc. 
His voice it is a 
baritone. 
And if you heard him try 
To sing, I 
feel assured it would bring 
A 
tear into your eye ; 
His upper notes are like the lark's. 
His lower notes are groans; 
Perhaps the Negro Minstrels have 
Bought him up for bones. 
Where can, etc.

PARODY ON THE MAID AND MULETEER. 
Composed by HARRY OSBORNE and sung by HARRY and FANNY. 
We are an Irish pair as you can plainly see, 
I 
think all the world of her, she thinks the same of me; 
Oh tell me, Patsy dear, who was that colleen bright 
Who was romping in the lane with you the other night. 
Oh please don't ask me that, for on paddle feet she goes, 
And I 
see her photo now, with that monstrous big nose. 
Oh Patsy be my friend, don't such compliment's extend, 
For you know that a 
great portion of that bugle you could 
lend. 
Do you say so, yes I 
say so. 
CHORUS. 
Oh then, sure, I 
love you well, but then for all that, 
To suit my taste you are too flat; 
Go away you great big ugly grey torn cat, 
The people know that you are that. 
Arrah, arrah, cushla gal machree, 
If you will only come with me 
We'll have a 
jolly spree. 
On Barney I 
can see with Blarney you're too free, 
You tould me yesterday that you would marry me. 
Oh Cathleen achree, I 
mean to marry thee, 
Then we will sail away from dear old Dublin Bay. 
No we cannot settle down in dear old Dublin town, 
So patsy we will go to a 
land where there's no toe. 
Yes darling we will happy be in that dear land of liberty, 
Yes glory into every son who followed 
Brave—George Washington. 
Oh then sure. IC.

I am Pat O'Neil, an Irishman, 
Just from the county Clare,— 
As smart as any ever walked 
To country dance or fair, 
But poverty the poor man's lot, 
Drove me across the sea, 
To find a 
home in this fair land 
Of sweet America. 
CHORUS. 
Many b, noble minded man 
For refuge flew to thee ; 
Your ports are always open, 
Ever ready is your hand, 
To welcome here both great and small 
From dear old Ireland. 
When I 
was home I 
often heard 
Of a 
country tar away, 
Where the rich and poor they both enjoy 
The same bright light ot day ; 
Then my heart says Pat don't work no more 
For nobles without pay, 
But go and gain your liberty 
in sweet America. 
Many a 
noble, etc. 
I'll not forget the noble flag, 
That guards our liberty,— 
Inviting those who are opposed, 
To come across the sea; 
Roping that the day may come 
When Ireland will be free,— 
Fit nave you all to give three cheers 
For sweet America.

OH. WHAT A 
DAY WE'RE HAVING. 
Sung by HARRY OSBORNE & FANNY W ENTWORTF1. 
IF 
you'll listen I'll tell you what happened last week, 
Brown and I 
we went fer our annual treat, 
And two pretty girls we happened to meet 
As we went to the palace at the park : 
The carriages all were as full as could be, 
So one pretty girl had to sit on my knee, 
And the other on Brown's, who shouted with glee, 
I 
say what a 
day we are having. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! what a 
day we are having, I 
say! 
Oh! what a 
day we are having, 
Enjoying ourselves with two pretty girls, 
I 
say what a 
day we are having. 
Our wives you must know we had both left at home 
So of course Brown and I 
were entirely alone, 
And we thought that about with these girls we could roam, 
And no one be any the wiser ; 
We soon reached the Palace, the gardens went in, 
Play'd at kiss in the ring, drank brandy and gin, 
And some fellow smashed Brown's new hat right in, 
singing, oh! what a 
day we are having. 
Oh ! what a 
day, etc. 
We all got as jolly as jolly could be, 
When Brown he proposed we should go and take tea, 
On this point the ladies of course did agree, 
So away to the tables we started; 
We ordered the tea, I 
had scarce taken my place, 
When a 
basin of slops was thrown in my face, 
21 
And two voices shouted out, here's a 
disgrace; 
And a 
very nice day you are having. 
Oh! what a 
day, etc. 
We both wiped our faces, look'd up with surprise, 
When there stood before us our two loving wives, 
Threat'ning to tear out those young ladies eyes, 
And they'd already torn off their bonnets. 
Ot course Brown and I 
no longer could stay, 
And with our two wives walked meekly away, 
And some swells in the crowd shouted out, Here I 
say! 
What a 
day you young scamps have been having. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, we had something to do, to square it with our 
wives, but Brown hit upon a 
happy thought, he proposed we 
should go to his house and finish the day. We did. He introduced 
the wine, we got jolly, Brown kissed my wife, I 
kissed his 
wife, then Brown said he would sing a 
comic song. This is what 
lie sang— 
Oh! what a 
day we are having, I 
say, 
Oh! what a 
day we are having, 
Enjoying ourselves with our own proper girls, 
I 
say I 
what a 
day we are having. 
ABEL AND ISABEL, 
AS 
Sung by TONy PASTOR, 
Entered according to Act of Congress in the Year 1S75, by A. 
FisnEn, in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
BUT as she would'ra come down stairs, 
A 
doleful history I'll relate 
About a 
loving pair, 
Who, through a 
very foolish act 
Were driven to despair; 
Abel was this young man's name, 
And her's was Isabel, 
And she was all the cause of what 
I'm now about to tell. 
CHORITs. 
Abel courted Isabel, who really was a 
Belle. 
Abel called on Isabel, and rang the bell for bell; 
But Bel was not agreeable 
To come down stairs to see Abel, 
So Abel was not able to see Isabel. 
This was a 
very trifling thing 
On Isabella's part; 
But trilling as it was, it nearly 
Broke poor Abel's heart. 
For, as he was a 
jealous man, 
The thought he could'nt nide 
That a 
rival was with Isabel, 
While he stood there outsfde. 
Abel courted Isabel, etc. 
Now Abel never thought that Bel 
Yight be in dishabille ; 
But as she would'nt come down stairs, 
Be cursed and swore a 
deal, 
II, then rushed to the water side, 
And madman as he was, 
1 
e 
tumbled in, but could'nt swim, 
So died, and all because— 
Abel courted Isabel, etc. 
The news soon spread about. 
And when it reached poor Bella's ears, 
her screams, they shook the house 
In which she'd lived for forty years. 
She took a 
dose of brimstone, 
And forever went to sleep. 
So ladies, when your lovers call, 
Pray think of this and weep. 
Abel courted Isabel, etc

VERD Children, and sung 
by them only. 
Girl.—At a 
ball, last night, I 
met 
A 
swell I 
can't forget ; 
With figure, face and form, 
That was so splendid ; 
Who made love at first sight, 
Tho' perhaps it wasn't right; 
His style was such I 
could'nt feel offended. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, I 
met him at the ball last night, boys, 
I 
met him at a 
ball last night; 
And to meet him here, to-night, 
I 
promised at first sight ; 
Tho' I 
met him at a 
1),111 last night— 
Enter Boy.—Yes, I 
met you at a 
ball last night, love, 
I 
met you at a 
ball last night ; 
And by the stars above I 
swore eternal love, 
Yes, I 
met you at the ball last night. 
[Chorus as before. 
Boy.—Pray don't feel offended at what I 
have said. 
Nor leave me with a 
toss of your pretty little 
head. 
Gir/.—Oh! Sir, I 
am not offended, 
But really, is it right 
That you should fall in love 
So deeply, at first sight ? 
[Chorus as before. 
ALL THAT GLITTERS IS NOT GOI 
[Music publishel by E. H. Hesnaro, 288 Bowery, price ten Gents.] 
As sung by FIUME VAN HEas. 
In this world of care and trouble, 
Where men toil with hand and bra* 
Seeking fame—that airy bubble, 
And not always seek in vain; 
Tho' the path's bestrewed with flowers, 
And the laurel bind his brow, 
All his friends admire his powers, 
lie can do without them now; 
Still he's wasted, worn and weary, 
And he finds he's growing old, 
Remember though the sage's adage,— 
" 
All that glitters is not gold." 
See the warrior brave in action, 
Ever ready for the fray; 
Sternly, nobly scorns all faction, 
And to freedom fights his way; 
How bears with cold and hunger— 
Houseless, homeless 'neath the sky; 
He must march a 
little longer, 
Till he hears the battle cry, 
Then his soul is filled with glory, 
Tho' his friends be stark and cold; 
Thus ends many a 
hero's story, 
" 
All that glitters is not gold." 
See the great and mighty noble, 
Rolling in his coach of state, 
Surely he has ne'er known trouble, 
His seems such a 
happy fate; 
He has heaps of land and money, 
Lovely wife and children fair; 
What a 
grand ancestral dwelling! 
Surely he has not a 
care 7 
Ask his friends and they will mutter, 
By his bankers he's been sold, 
And this will prove the truth I 
ttter,—. 
" 
All that glitters is not gold." 
WArNE and LOVELY'S own original song and dance. 
Written 
expressly for them by BARRY CARTER. 
HOW 
lovely seems this world of ours, with something sweet to 
love, 
I've lately met with something sweet, and gentle as a 
dove ; 
I 
met her first one summer's eve, the stars shone bright and 
clear, 
While music floated on the winds in a 
park not far from here. 
CHORUS. 
My Belle she's a 
beautiful blonde, 
In a 
style others try to excel, 
Yet there's none in this land can compare, 
With my darling, my beautiful Belle. 
Her laugh is rippling r 
ielody so soft and sweet, 
Sym. 
With pretty little tapering hands and pretty feet, 
Sym. 
Beneath her (lancing golden curls, 
Tier eyes shone bright and clear, 
She's sweet, but better than she looks, 
My pretty little dear. 
By some one we were introduced ; some good old friend of 
mine; . 
Her dress is faultless to a 
hair, I 
thought she was divine, 
So bewilderingly, so beautiful, this charmer fair did seem, 
Ever since that night this world to me seems an enchanted 
dream. 
I've loved her 
well, 
And says I 
am 
But soon we'll 
It won't be far 
will hear, 
My Belle, she's a 
beautiful blonde, etc. 
well since first we met, she loves me just as 
divinely sweet, my darling blue-eyed Belle; 
wed and settle down, I 
must not tell that here, 
from the gay sea-shore, when the dancing waves 
My Belle, she's a 
beautiful blonde, etc.

THE BELLE OF THE RINK. 
— 
As Sung by THE BRAHAMS. 
'Twas down beside the sad sea waves, 
That I 
first met fair Helen; 
At once my heart felt Cupid's dart, 
'Gainst which there's no rebelling. 
I 
asked her, " Would she have a 
sail ?" 
She answered—what d'ye think ? 
" 
Not me, no fear it makes me queer, 
For I'm the Belle of the Rink." 
Cnonus. 
Yes, I'm the Belle of the Rink, 
The Skating Rink's now all the go, 
It's awfully jolly, don't you know, 
To be the Belle of a 
Skating Stink! 
I'd not essayed the skates before, 
But when I 
saw her action, 
I'd try awhile, she gave a 
smile, 
Expressing satisfaction; 
But, oh ! no sooner did I 
start, 
(I'd not e'en time to wink,) 
Ere on my back I 
came a 
crack, 
Beside the Belle of the Rink! 
Yes, Pm the Belle, & e. 
She helped me up officiously, 
But had no sooner done so, 
Than butt I 
ran against a 
man, 
Who didn' see the fun so ; 
With his two fists he pommelled me, 
And made my poor eyes blink— 
But where was she ? I 
could not see 
The beauteous Belle of the Rink! 
Yes, Pm the Belle, &c. 
I 
soon removed the hateful skates, 
Then in my pockets feeling, 
I 
found my purse, and what was worse, 
My watch they had been stealing! 
"That lady and her friend are gone," 
The man said, with a 
wink, 
"My! you was green or you'd ha' seen, 
She ain't no Belle of the Rink !" 
Yes, I'm the Bell, & c. 
I 
never saw fair Helen more, 
Nor yet my watch and money, 
And have not tried again to slide, 
Which p'rhaps you think is funny, 
But now I 
warn young gentlemen, 
Who're not perfection's pink, 
To have a 
care, and oh! beware 
Of sof-styled Belles of the Rink! 
Yes, ' m the Belle, Sic,

The Bird on the Tree. 
Words by FRANK W . 
GREEN. Music by ANTHONY Nisa. 
THE bird on the tree is singing his song, 
So sweetly to me the whole evening long; 
How happy and. gay, how joyadi3 and free, 
He is with his song, sweet bird on the tree. 
The daylight is fleeting, the moon shines above, 
'Tis time for our meeting, 0, Cora; my love. 
To guide thee to me, dear, the woodlands along, 
The bird on the tree, dear, is singing—is singing 
his song. 
CHORUS. 
Thou listen, then listen, then listen, then listen, 
The 1bird on the tree, dear, is singing his song, 
The bird on tree is singing his song; 
Yes, he calls, yes, he calls, 
He is calling for thee, 
He is calling for thee, 
Is the bird, is the bird on the tree. 
The bird on the tree sings carols so clear, 
His song full of glee now falls on mine ear; 
Then haste to me, pray, I 
am waiting for thee, 
And fain would be gay like the bird on the tree. 
The blossoms are sleeping, the wind, softly sighs, 
The fair stars are peeping above in the skies, 
To guide thee to me, dear, the woodlands along, 
The bird on the tree, dear, is singing—is singing 
his song.

THE CAVALIER AT THE BALL. 
A 
lady's beautiful serio comic song—Written and Com-
posed for MAs. W . 
I. 
FLORENCR, as a 
reply to her famous 
song of " The Captain"—sung, also, by the Composer, 
ROLLIN HOWARD, as one of "THE BLATHERSKITES," in 
their famous " Opera Bouffe," " THE RAG PAG." 
Published by C. D. 
RIIBBELL & Co., Boston, dass. 
Oh I 
girls, is their one would believe, now, 
There's another string tied to my bow? 
As a 
secret to me is a 
bother, 
Of this new one I'll soon let you know. 
It was on last Christmas evening 
I 
went to a 
ball, dressed so fine, 
When Papa introduced a 
young soldier, 
On whose arm I 
marched down the line. 
Brox:ex—Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I 
never shall forget it 
For it was at a 
Ball that I 
met him, 
And the music was so rich and gay; 
It was there that this young Cavalier, girls, 
First stole my fond heart away. 
We first danced the Polka Mazourka, 
With his arm tightly clasped 'round my waist; 
I 
ne'er shall forget how it pleased me, 
It answered well for an embrace; 
The Captain was thefe with his whiskers, 
And though it may seem most unkind, 
The sweet, ways of the Cavalier, girls, 
Caused me to leave the bold Captain behind. 
For it was at a 
Ball, Ste, 
OF THE " PLUNGERS." 
TAKE the Army List and search it thro' examine ev'ry name, 
And you'll not find an Officer eclipsing me in fame, 
For tho' no medals I 
have won and never shall I 
think, 
I 
am the " Plungers " pet you know, in short I'm Captain Pink. 
Not know me? fie! what, never heard of Captain Pink, it's too 
absurd! 
When scarce an Evening Post comes out, but there my name 
you see, 
There's not a 
night I 
am out, at Lady Somcome's ball or rout. 
And bye-the-bye the routs I 
mean are victories for me. 
CHORUS. 
Take the Army List and search it thro', examine every name, 
And you'll not find and officer eclipsing me in fame, 
For tho' no medals I 
have won—and never shall I 
think, 
I 
am the " Plungers" pet you know, in short I'm Captain Pink.. 
Ask the ladies, they will tell you what a 
man I 
am to dance, 
how dangerous 'Os to flirt with me, the dears have not a 
chance 
You see we military men have manners quite our own, 
The " Plungers " are invincible in storming Cupid's throne! 
How can the darlings stand this smile? this killing look it must 
beguile, 
I've practised it much oft'ner than I 
ever did my drill, 
Then in the valse, a 
gentle squeeze, I 
know the proper way tie 
please, 
I'm called the " Lady killer!" such my amatory skill. 
Take tl" 
I 
eau make my spurs and sabre clank, sand give the regular 
salute, 
I 
can still retain my war-like ways tho' in my mufti suit; 
The Club Chef is afraid of me, I 
make my valet shake, 
And the very waiters tremble, when they ask me what I'll take, 
I 
am a 
judge of wine and weeds, I 
keep a 
pair of matchless 
steeds, 
And once to serve a 
chum of mine I 
kept guard at the bank; 
What's more, I 
once was in a 
fight, a 
sham one—'twas a 
glori-
ous sight 
To see me at a 
hay-rick bravely charging down point blank. 
Take the, &e. 
I 
do not care for cricket much, they bowl so very swift, 
At Croquet I 
m invincible, for spooning I've a 
gift; 
I 
also boast strategic skill, I 
bring it into play, 
By getting supper at a 
ball, the crush be what it may, 
I 
am au fait in songs and glees, I'm always good for mild sprees 
I 
love my little luxuries, and so I 
have no wife; 
I 
have a 
sword that's very clear, but would you be surprised to 
hear? 
I 
never struck a 
blow with it in all my soldier life. 
I'm sure you all must join with me in giving America joy, 
To think that in her army, she can men like me employ, 
And reckon on one officer at least who'll never shrink, 
PrsithiFashion's duty calls, you know—your gallant Captain 
Air " Beautiful Girls." 
YOU may talk about pleasures gained 
By strolling on the sand, 
Or walking down Broadway where belles 
And swells oft do the grand. 
Or rolling home in a 
morning, boys, 
After a 
jolly lark; 
But none of these can be compared 
With a 
stroll through Central Park. 
CHORUS. 
Central Park when out for a 
lark, 
The place for enjoyment is Central Park, 
For beautiful belles, and flashy young swells 
You'll find them in Central Park. 
In Central Park one summer's night 
I 
met the girl I 
love, 
A 
graceful belle with sylph like-form, 
A 
perfect little dove, 
We strolled together arm in arm 
'Till it grew rather dark; 
'Tis blissful paradise on earth 
To walk through Central Park, 
Central Park, when out for a 
lark, etc. 
We stopped a 
while to listen, 
To the music soft and sweet, 
Then saw her home, asked when and where 
Again I 
might her meet, 
She blushed and smiled, and looked so sweet, 
Then to me did remark ; 
6
, 
We'll meet again to-morrow night, 
The place, why Central Park." 
Central Park, when out for a 
lark, etc. 
While strolling in the Park one night, 
She gave me her consent; 
To see her ma and pa, of course 
We both together went, 
The moment that I 
asked for her, 
The old folks did remark : 
z
, 
Yes, take. her, and the honeymoon 
Go spend in Central Park. 
Central Park, when out for a 
lark, etc. 
Written by HARRY BENNETT. 
ALTHOUGH I 
have no money, 
I'm just as sweet as honey; 
I 
travel on my shape, because 
I'm neither stout nor thin; 
The girls all say I'm pretty, 
And also wise and witty; 
There's not a 
masher in this town 
Like Chesterfield McFlynn. 
CHORUS. 
By-bye, Charlie, you're a 
pet of mine; 
I'll meet you in the clock, 
When the lane strikes nine; 
I'll strike you with a 
gum drop, 
You giddy little lass; 
I'll sick you with my spitz dog, 
And I'll stab you with blue glass. 
At every evening party 
You'll find me there so hearty, 
I 
never step upon the floor 
Till dancing does begin; 
I 
dance in latest fashion, 
My appearance it is dashing; 
Ihey- can't resist the figure of 
Charles Chesterfield McFlynn. 
By-bye, Charlie, etc. 
I 
AM a 
man of distinction and learning, ye see, 
I 
am a 
thorough sport every time; 
I 
am the flower of fashion wherever I 
be; 
With the boys I've spent many a 
dime; 
I 
can play casino, I 
can live fast or slow, 
Whichever may suit me the best, 
And whenever I 
stop at a 
ball or a 
hop 
I 
have a 
gold watch in my vest, oh yes. 
CHORUS. 
I 
am George Magee, 
Tra la la lee; 
Just look at me, 
And you will see 
An Irishman 
Of high degree; 
The ladies' pet, 
I'm George Magee. 
I 
have a 
wink in my eye that does capture the girls, 
And my smiles they can never resist; 
My black Carolinas the barber he curls, 
And I 
have a 
gold ring on my fist, 
And everyone knows as they look at my clothes 
They're made of good stuff, firm and strong; 
As I 
walk on the street every damsel I 
meet 
Pipes my figure as I 
move along. 
I 
am George Magee, etc,

I'LL sing of a 
band that used to play 
Music in the street, 
And if you heard it you would say 
It was anything but sweet. 
They all played different instruments, 
The music was the same, 
They were all one family, 
And Morgan was their name. 
CHORUS. 
Johnny Morgan played the organ, 
The father beat the drum, 
The sister played the tambourine, 
The brother went porn, porn, poin—poni, porn, porn, 
All alone on an old trombone; 
The music was so sweet 
They often got a 
penny 
To go into another street. 
They used to say that Johnny was 
The smartest of them all, 
And round the area windows 
He would often make a 
call. 
His music vas so lively, 
All the latest airs from France, 
The servant girls could not keep still, 
The music made them dance. 
John Morgan played the, etc. 
Now one day John he chanced to play 
Outside a 
lady's door, 
And the lady said she never heard 
Such music played before; 
It pleased her so, that you must know, 
She heavy sums would pay 
To John, to stand outside the house, 
And play to her all day. 
John Morgan played the, etc. 
John played upon his instrument, 
And pleased the lady so, 
That when the time arrived to leave, 
She would not let him go. 
She asked if he would marry her, 
Which John did very soon, 
Now on the organ Johnny Morgan 
Plays her many a 
tune.

JEREMIAH, 
Sung with the most overwhelming success, all over the country, 
by HARRY MONTAGUE. 
MY 
name is Jeremiah Jones, and when I 
was a 
child 
I 
was up to every little trick that drove my mother wild. 
I 
would take the bellows on my knee, to blow the fire I'd try, 
And when the fire began to blaze, I 
lustily would cry. 
CHORUS. 
Jeremiah, blow the fire, puff, puff, puff, 
Jeremiah, blow the tire, puff, puff, puff; 
First you do it gently, then you do it rough. 
Jeremiah, blow the fire, puff, puff, puff. 
When I 
grew a 
little older, to a 
blacksmith I 
was bound, 
To learn the art of shoeing, which a 
bootless task I 
found. 
They cancelled my indentures, for I 
raised the boss's ire 
By shouting out the whole day long, while dancing round the 
fire. 
Jeremiah, blow the fire, etc. 
In time I 
loved a 
pretty girl, and strange though it may be, 
The lady in her younger days, lived very close to me, 
And when I 
asked her to be mine, she blushed and bowed her 
head, 
And when I 
pressed her lips to mine, in awful tones she said-
Jeremiah, blow the fire, etc. 
We're married now, and I'm proud to state we've been for sev-
eral years. 
We're very happy for we've got some little household dears. 
They're all of them strong-winded, which you'd say without a 
doubt 
If you came into our domicile and chanced to hear them shout: 
Jeremiah, blow the fire, etc,

As sung by W ILLIAM PER 
HOLY, " 
Do Man Wid de Bassoon." 
I 
ONCE had a 
brother, the son of his mother, 
But somehow or other, ye see, 
Though lie was a 
darling he always was snarling, 
With me could never agree; 
He'd hardly say twenty words in a 
day, 
If he thought he was going to be kilt, 
But his mouth he'd pucker like some big sucker, 
And this is the tune he would lilt, 
(Whistle with piccolo accompaniment.) 
My sweet brother, Teddy, he over was ready 
To whistle a 
tune at your call; 
He always was merry, his mouth like a 
cherry 
Played sweeter than pipes at a 
ball; 
He whistled his landlady out of her rent, 
He whistled his mother-in-law sick, 
Till some big Italian, the dirty rapscallion, 
Knocked out Teddy's teeth with a 
brick.

The turn-out will be grand; 
From the windows high they're shouting, 
" 
Oh, what a 
glorious day 
To see the MacMahon Grenadiers 
March out in fine array. 
CHORES. 
Yes, while we are a 
marching; 
Yes, a

The ladies, yes, the darling little dears, 
With open hands they shout aloud 
For the MacMahon Grenadiers. 
Our colonel's name's MacMahon, 
Our captain is O'Hale, 
If they should call on us to fight. 
You bet we ne'er will fail; 
41 
We are not one of the home guards 
Who never fight but run, 
But solid soldiers to the front 
You'll find the MacMahons. 
Yes, a

We are the ladies' favorites 
When we go on parade, 
With stars and stripes and green flag flying, 
Oh may their colors never fade 
In the future, should they call on us 
To fight for our homes so dear; 
We'll be the first men on the field— 
The MacMahon Grenadiers. 
Yes, a 
marching, etc. 
REFRAIN. 
As through the streets we march, 
We break the ladies' hearts 
Our style is of the best 
When we appear; 
Our fame for solid Irishmen, 
And the love for Ireland 
Will never more be tarnished 
By the MacMahon Grenadiers. 
Yes, a

MEN OF EDUCATION. 
MR. O'LEARY. 
Song and Dance by HARRY and JOHN KERNELL. 
DON'T talk to us of your high-toned men; 
With their fluent conversation, 
For with us boys none can compare, 
We are the greatest in the nation; 
We are known by all, both great and small, 
Two Irishmen from Donegal, 
And we'll have ye know, both one and all, 
We're men of education. 
CHORUS. 
We are Irishmen both heart and hand, 
We have just come here to this free land, 
And we'll have you all to understand, 
We are men of education. 
Now the mayor of the town he is our best friend. 
And we drink with him every day; 
He is going to run us for Congressmen, 
And you bet we'll make it pay; 
Muldoon is envious of our fame, 
And Roger O'Malley has changed his name, 
And the ladies are wanting to know the names 
Of the men of education. 
Written and Sung by JOHN FIELDING. 
I 
SUPPOSE yes have read of ould Ireland, 
And her dear little shamrock shore, 
Where the boys and the girls are so frisky, 
When smothered in whiskey gallore. 
Oh! musha but that is the place, 
For fun, for blarney, and wit, 
So if yes will list to my rhymes, 
Be the powers I 
will tip yes a 
bit. 
CHORUS. 
For me name it is Mr. O'Leary, 
Oh! Leary. 
Oh! Leary, 
Who came from the County Tipperary, 
In the parish of sweet Gotlinahu. 
Our balls an our parties remember, 
All got up in Megan t 
style, 
We have pipes, and tobacco, and whiskey, 
And butter-milk that would make you smile. 
We dance reels, jigs, and cowtillians, 
And break-downs by the score, 
Till the piper gets drunk as the (Evil, 
And he's taken home on the barn door. 
At our fairs there is fun by the bushel, 
For those who will join in our games, 
At a 
christening there's oftimes the divil, 
In giving the poor child a 
name. 
At a 
wake there's sometimes a 
row, 
The divil a 
word of a 
lie, 
The corpse ofttimes goes to its grave, 
With a 
most beautiful, delicious black eye.

I'VE a 
daughter who's surely gone crazy, 
It is a 
hard thing, I 
declare; 
She's now a 
theatrical lady, 
And wears a 
wig over her hair. 
She says " Wilt thou meet me by moonlight ? 
My heart's blood I 
would lose for thee !" 
She strikes attitudes in the kitchen, 
And kisses her fingers at me, 
CHORUS. 
In the day time she's Mary McGinness, 
And employs all her time washing clothes, 
But at night on the stage she's a 
countess, 
And they call her the " Lady Montrose," 
Shnre, the wash-tub she calls it a 
castle, 
The soap is a 
dagger so keen, 
The coal-box she calls it a 
grotto— 
Such goings on I've niver seen, 
She stabs herself with a 
potato, 
And says "' Tis for thee, love, I 
die !" 
On the ceiling she has a 
tomato, 
And calls it the moon in the sky. 
In the day time she's Mary McGinniss, ttc. 
She tells me she'll be a 
great actress, 
Admirers she'll have by the score, 
She'll be courted by dukes, kings and princes, 
And the divel knows how many more. 
She uses my hat for a 
casket, 
For jewels she fills it with coal ; 
For a 
carriage she has the clothes-basket, 
And the clothes-pins are silver and gold. 
In the day-time she's Mary McGinniss, eke. 
THE MACGREGORS' GATHERING. 
As sung by Amon Bitinirr.r. 
Written by WALTYR 80077. 
Music by Amex. Lam, 
The moon's on the Lake, and the mist's on the brae, 
And the clan has a 
name that is nameless by day, 
Our signal for fight which from monarchs we drew, 
Must be heard but by night in our vengeful haloo. 
CHORUS. 
Then haloo, haloo, halloo Gregalach, 
If they rob us of name and pursue us with Beagles, 
Give their roofs to the flame and their flesh to the Eagles. 
Then gather, gather, gather, gather, gather, gather, 
While there's leaves in the forest, and foam on the river, 
Macgregor despite them shall flourish forever. 
Glenorchy's proud mountain, Colchurn and her towers, 
Glenstrae and Glenlyon, no longer are ours, 
We're landless, landless, landless, 
Gregalach, landless, landless, landless. 
Thro' the depths of Loch Kathrine the steed shall career, 
O'er the peak of Benlomond the galley shall steer, 
And the rocks of Craig Royston, like icicles melt, 
Ere our wrongs he forgot, or our vengeance unfelt. 
Then haloo, th.

Arrah I 
Mickey, put your Frieze Coat on. 
As sung by Jinum ill/GHZ9. 
ARRAII! Mickey, will ye leave us thus, 
To cross the raging main; 
When gone, what will become of me, 
Should you ne'er come back again: 
The Hawthorn it may flower in Spring! 
The Daisy bright may grow— 
But naught to me will comfort bring, 
If you, my darling, go. 
, 
CHORUS, 
Arrahl Mickey, put your frieze coat on, 
Walk through the bog with me; 
And you can whisper in my ear, 
How dearly you love me. 
What need you leave your native land, 
We've courted many a 
year— 
Then stop where sweet the Shamrock grows, 
Stop with your Kathleen dear. 
Though peace and plenty waits you there, 
In that land " beyant" the sea! 
To break my heart is hardly fair, 
So stop with love and me. 
Arrah 
Mickey, Stc. 
My Granny's got a 
cow and pig, 
An eight-day clock and all; 
With a 
picture of St. Patrick, 
That hangs against the wall. 
There's an arm chair stands beyant the nook, 
Close by the bright turf fire; 
Where the " potheen " bottle lies concealed, 
What more can you desire. 
Arrah! Mickey, ,t!Lc. 
I've got pots and kettles shining bright, 
To deck our Cottage out; 
The boys and girls are waiting, dear, 
The welcome news to shout, 
That you will stay among us all, 
And the lark will sweeter sing; 
And the bells from every village spire 
The joyful news shall ring. 
Arrah! Mickey er.c. 
MISTER BARNEY, one day, went to Limerick fair, 
And hired a 
noddy to carry him there, 
To meet pretty Shelah Megan. 
But Shelah had waited some time for the boy, 
And thought he'd been playing with Katty Molloy, 
To tell him her mind thus began : 
" 
Och ! Mister Barney, 
None of your carney; 
Hands of and don't be so free; 
You've been with the girls,. 
Your muffin-face tells, 
And the devil may have you for me, Mister Barney," 
Mister Barney, who little thought thus to be used, 
Made an oath that his honor and words she abused, 
And could she be Shelah Megan ? 
Then running to kiss her—She cried: " if you're wise, 
Don't touch me! or, Barney, I'll scratch out your eyes— 
I 
know you're a 
vile wicked man; 
So Mister Barney, 
None of your carney; 
Illnds off! and don't be so free: 
You've been with the girls, 
Your baby-face tells, 
d 
the devil may have -Nu for me, Mister Barney." 
Mister Barney then pulled out a 
bit of a 
rope, 
And told her: " that since he had nothing to hope, 
He'd hang up for Shelah Megan." 
But Shelah, grown softer, his purpose to check, 
Cried: " No! if you hang, let it be round my neck, 
Though, Barney,', arn't you a 
sad man ? 
Och! Mister Barney, 
Pretty-faced Barney, 
And is it the ring there I 
see ? 
We'll ride in the noddy 
To Father O'Toddy, 
And married—oeb! no, we won't be—Mister Barney!"

An Irish character duet. 
Words and music by JOHN 
KELLY, as originally sung with wonderful success by the gret* 
"Bards of Tara," KELLY & RYAN. 
The hit of the season. 
Kind friends just listen now to us, 
And well sing to you a 
rhyme, 
And tell you of our youthful days, 
When we were in our prime. 
We're getting old, yes very old, 
And soon must pass away, 
We've traveled on life's weary road, 
With spirits always gay. 
CHORUS. 
Old Mr. and Mrs. Malone, 
Old Mr. and Mrs. Malone, 
A 
jollier old pair you'll seldom find— 
Than Mr, and Mrs. Malone, 
'Tis now some sixty years ago 
Since we first joined our lot, 
And in that time there's nothing wrong 
Transpired in our cot. 
We've had our share of sunshine, 
And of course we can't complain; 
Them good old days that's passed and gone, 
Can never come back again.

Words and Music by JouN T. 
KELLY, 
As sung with great success by the wonderful character 
actors, " The Bards of Tara," KELLY & RYAN. 
Good evening to you all, 
We hope we see you well, 
We thought we'd make a 
call, 
So hear what we've to tell. 
O'Rooney, that's our name, 
We're brothers, Mike and Dan, 
From Ireland , boys, we came, 
Two honest, laboring men. 
Now we were made two tinkers by trade, 
We'll tell you the reason why, 
When we were young, we first began 
To tinker on the sly ; 
But now we're on the road, 
So give us but a 
chance, 
We'll show to you a 
thing or two, 
In Irish song and dance. 
C1101076.—Duet. 
With our blang, blang, blang, 
And our clang, clang, clang, 
To your pots and your kettles we'll attend. 
With our blang, blang, blang, 
And our clang, clang, clang, 
Have ye any tin ware to mend. 
We'll mend your old kettles, 
Your boilers and baking pans, 
Your coffee pots, your tea pots, 
Or any kind of cans. 
We never deal in politics, 
Yet how handy we could be, 
To sodder and patch 
What fraud has cracked, 
And mend the country. 
We soon shall stop our roving, 
When it comes on winter time, 
'Tis then we work inside our shop, 
Where our trade it is so fine. 
But now we must away, 
Please remember, if you can, 
The merry old Irish tinkers, 
)3rothers Mike and Dan. 
Duet Chorus. 
With our wack, wack, wack, 
And our quack, quack, quack, 
Soddering all the day. 
With our quack, quack, quack, 
And our wack, wack, wack, 
We pass our time away. 
Repeat chorus.

Our President's name's Callahan, 
First cousin to Tim Flaherty, 
He's a 
true-hearted Irishman, 
And for the poor has sympathy; 
When they're in want, and call on him, 
lie assists them like a 
man, 
Long may live Mister Callahan, 
A 
noble " Hibernian." 
SPOREN:—He's one of the finest men that ever trod the earth, 
so, if you'll keep your eyes open, you'll be sure to see Mr. Calla-
han, the President of the " Hibernians." 
CI10:—As 
we march thro' the streets-

So now I'll bid ye all good night 
And go see Felix Rafferty, 
To please ye, sure, I've done my might— 
Now don't you say this is flattery. 
And if I'm called again to sing 
I'll do the best I 
can— 
My motto is to try and please 
Like a 
true " Hibernian." 
SPOKEN:—
Ys, I 
lore to plaze, and especially the ladies, so 1 
want all gintlemen that's here present. to bring their wires and 
sweethearts to see our grand parade, and don't forget to call their 
particular attention to Mr. Michael Hogan, the Marshal. 
Cuo:—As we march thro' the streets— 
Kind friends just listen to me now, 
A 
few words I 
have to say, 
And I 
hope I 
won't displease you, 
Here this pleasant day; 
It's about a 
man well known to you, 
You will say, no doubt of that, 
His name it is Mike Kennedy, 
And he wears a 
piccadilly hat. 
CHORUS. 
He takes in moonlight picnics, 
For dancing he is fond of that; 
And in a 
crowd makes himself loud, 
With his piccadilly hat. 
On Monday night Mike comes home tight, 
His wife to him will say— 
Come up stairs, dear Michael, 
And don't on the stoop lay; 
You know the neighbors they will talk, 
And what will you think of that, 
They will sweep the sidewalk up with you, 
And your piccadilly hat. 
He takes in, etc. 
- 
What do I 
care for the neighbors ? 
I 
want you to understand 
I'm as fine a 
looking young man, 
As there is in this land; 
And when the girls see him, 
Their hearts go pit-a-pat, 
They laugh and chaff, and say dear Mike, 
Shake that piccadilly hat. 
On Monday night you will lose sight of Mike, 
To the Fourteenth Ward he goes, 
To get upon a 
racket, 
With his week's wages, you know; 
Now, Michael dear, give this thing up, 
And try to save your cents, 
And buy a 
new style of hat, 
In the name of common sense. 
The boys-all yell at Michael, 
And say he is getting fat, 
They are getting up a 
collection, 
For to buy him a 
new hat.

Whene'er I 
think about you, 
Both day, and night, you're in my sight, 
I 
cannot live without you ;— 
A 
pig, a 
cow, a 
sheep I've got,

house to keep you drily, 
So say the word, and like a

I'll make you Mrs. Riley. 
Ritidifolol-Ritidifolol, 
She—Now Mr. Pat, get out of that, 
With your silly botheration, 
For when you talk to me like that, 
You fill me with vexation ; 
Although you've kissed the blarney stone, 
You can't coax me so slyly, 
I'd rather still be Miss Malone, 
Than Mrs. Judy Riley. 
Ritidifolol, &c. 
He—I 
know the reason very well, 
To my oiler you're no taker, 
You've fell in love with Mickey Ball,

thump of this, [Shows stick] 
By jabers it will spoil his cobbling.

She—Although he's lame—he's lots of cash, 
And a 
man of great discerning,

am his, without mishap, 
Like doves we'll live together.

And you'll never want for leather. 
Ritidifolol, & c. 
She—Now Mister Pat, just hould yer gab, 
Your spa,king does not please me, 
Some one would think, to see your tricks, 
That love had made you crazy ; 
He—You've hit the nail, right on the head, 
Now don't be acting slyly, 
Take that! ( KissEs HER) and in a 
jiffey sa; 
You'll be Mrs. Riley. 
Ritidifol-lol-lol &a 
She—Now Paddy dear—one can't resist, 
At coaxing your so clever, 
And since you do so much insist, 
Why I'll be yours forever ; 
He—I 
knew you would, you little goat, 
Let's away to Father Wiley's, 
And very soon we'll fill the house,

They came to exercise themselves at Miss Maloney's Ball. 
Young Rooney with his impudence, attempted to advance,

Sure then I

Mulcahy got so tipsy 
He went sprawling on the floor, 
And when we got him to LiS feet, 
He tumbled through the door. 
He shouted " melia murther" 
And the girls began to squall, 
Which brought the neghbors running in, 
To Miss Maloney's Ball. 
The whiskey made us lively, 
And the dust began to fly, 
Malony's daughter fainted, 
And we thought she'd surely die. 
We picked her up and brought her to,

There's a 
message from the many, 
From the many to the few, 
Toiling millions ask for justice 
From the rich, which is their due; 
Honest workers toiling, sighing, 
Crowning hearts as true as steel, 
Suffering, starving, groaning, dying, 
'Neath oppression's iron heel. 
CIIORUS. 
Then give to the poor 
The hand of free good will, 
And help your struggling brother 
To climb life's rugged hill; 
Truth makes the man, 
And not his money bags, 
For crime oft stands in broadcloth, 
Whilst honesty's in rags. 
To the rich the poor are step-stones, 
Stepping stones to fortune's dower, 
Ever grinding down their wages, 
Up they mount to wealth and power; 
Oh, ye purse-proud sons of mammon, 
Whilst you o'er your riches gloat, 
Don't forget that honest people 
Often wear a 
ragged coat.

Charlotte Templ e.—To those who have never perused the 
sad story of Charlotte Temple, joyed with her in her early pleasures, 
sympathized and wept with her in her sorrows, and glowed with indig-
nation at the wrongs which she suffered from base, calculating villains, 
an opportunity is afforded of reading one of the most absorbing works 
ever written, proving 
truth stranger than fiction." The poet'e linel 
are but a 
just description of the unfortunate Charlotte Temple : 
Her form was faultless, and her mind 
Untainted yet by art, 
Was noble, just, humane and kind. 
And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ah! the cruel spoiler came—" 
This book, in the language of Mrs. Howson, " affords a 
striking example 
that vice, however prosperous in the beginning, in the end only leads 
to misery and shame."

American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is tne old-
est and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We have 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
2t 
ese Cards are arranged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Die-
Monde and Spades—and each or these into K for King, Q for Queen. 
and K 
for Knave, and numbers 1. 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. Many of the an. 
depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. 
Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too difti. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result a 
this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
.
5, 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
fa adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
