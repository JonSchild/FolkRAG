Introduction is already in progress.  Bill is introducing Lowell City Manager Jimmy Campbell.
B:  You have to work hard to be a city manager.  The hard work the part that owes it's 
professional success the inherent part of what's necessary for professional success.  Jim has 
worked hard as a law.  But it's not, not only a question of working hard.  Ah, it's not only a 
question of paying attention to the day to [unclear] in council.  You'll see the results [unclear] but
it's also having a sense of a bigger picture.  [unclear] If I read it correctly Jim has talked about 
the Lowell [unclear] and on the social agenda as we impart a history of Lowell's revitalization 
that's the part that we're especially interested in here.  That parts learning to ah, what were doing 
here at the University is the part [unclear this introduction is extremely difficult to understand] 
That's what Jim promised for Lowell people.  We'd like to know more about what that means for 
Jim, for the city.  And we hope we'll hear about how we as a culture department and a university 
can help [unclear] so it's a pleasure for us to be able to have Jim here tonight to talk with us 
J:  Thank you very much Bill.  Ah, It's certainly a pleasure to be here.  I don't know how wide 
awake I am but, I'm here.  Ah, for those of you who are wondering ah, what this contraption is 
ah, I'm told that we're being taped ah, for the Library of Congress so, I guess this is a, a special 
event.  Ah, what I would like to do is just speak in, informally and then open it up to questions.  
Ah, what I would like to talk about today is the role of the neighborhood and the neighborhood 
um, in particular, in the city of Lowell.  And to talk about, briefly about some of the human 
services ah, in the city as the effect the city and the cities involvement.  I think before you can 
talk about the present day neighborhood you have to ah, have a picture of what the past was like 
ah, in the City of Lowell.  Ah, because that leads into ah, I guess the, the  argument or classic 
argument of when a community is, is revitalized or is in the process of being revitalized, where 
do you start?  Do you start in the neighborhoods?  Do you start in the down town business 
district ah, and let it trickle down?  I think the most important element there is, is that you start 
some, some place.  And in Lowell's case it started in the down town business district.  Um, that's 
open for debate and I'm sure that argument will debated about Lowell and about many other 
communities ah, in the future.  Ah, but to paint a picture of what Lowell was like ah, let's say ten 
twelve years ago.  Ah, the city was a very depressed area, very depressed area to live in.  I 
happen to have lived here.  I've lived here all my life.  Ah, at that time, if you can picture the 
downtown area.  We had at least a hundred buildings that were in tax titled or that were in the 
process of going into tax title.  Which means that the city was taking the property ah, because of 
non-payment of taxes.  In effect the city was going into the real estate business.  Ah, the 
unemployment rate was running ah, from 12 to 15%, and it was an extremely depressed area.  So
ah, we had the opportunity ah, at that time ah, ten, nine or ten years ago ah, to take advantage of 
the possibility of becoming ah, a National Historical Park because of the heritage of the City of 
Lowell.  What that brought was federal grants and some revitalization of buildings in the down 
town which was then multiplied.  So at that rate ah, we started to really strengthen the, the down 
town and to try to strengthen the economy to bring jobs into the community.  And to strengthen 
the downtown business district.  Ah, there was criticism during this period of time that not 
enough was, was happening in the neighborhoods.  And I think certainly a lot of it was, was 
justified.  But I have to go back to my original point that you have to start somewhere.  Things 
were pretty hopeless in, in Lowell at that point.  We were ah, we had, I believe we had ah, the 
highest unemployment rate of any mid-size city in the United States at that, that particular time.  
So it just illustrates how difficult things really were at that, that period of time.  We went through
a period of rapid growth ah, these hundred buildings or so that I talked about are certainly no 
longer ah, on the city's rolls.  And a matter of fact their, their price and ah, value has increased 
dramatically ah, during that period of time.  We've seen the, the ah, starting or the catalyses I 
guess you could say of the, of the National Park.  And then followed by the hotel and the Wang 
Center which lead to other development in the downtown area.  And we have ah, projected for 
next ah, three to five years about $200,000,000 worth of development taking place in the 
downtown business district.  I for one believe that we reached a point in time where ah, we went 
into what I will refer to as the second phase of, of the revitalization of a city.  Which in this case 
is Lowell.  And ah, it, it, I think it some what coincided with my taking my taking office.  Not 
necessarily because I took office.  But I think that, the city was ready and we were primed and 
we were headed in that direction of the second part of the revitalization.  Which ah, ah, had, has 
to take place in order for the process to be complete.  And I for one think that perhaps the second 
phase maybe even more difficult than the, than the first phase.  Ah, but you have to accomplish 
the first phase I believe to get to the second phase.  We talk about areas now that, that deal with 
quality of life in the community.  Um, instead of talking about ah, how high the building is going
to be or how many square feet it's going to be.  You hear ah, press releases coming out of City 
Hall talking about projects that relate to quality of life in the community.  Ah, you hear city 
officials talking about education.  You hear city officials talking about housing, crime, culture, 
litter in our neighborhoods.  And issues that do effect the quality of life.  Ah, in terms of 
education ah, the city has realized that, that we've really lagged behind greatly in that area.  On 
the city side of government, which is called my side of government, which really, there's not that 
involvement in the educational process.  Except that we fund the budget, and we're in charge of 
the physical complex ah, complexes.  And ah, the City of Lowell ah, for those of you who are 
familiar with the school buildings and for those of you who are not has a very run down school 
system.  I ah, just to take you back a few years.  I was a, a teacher in the Lowell School System 
in 1969.  And I was appointed ah, to be a liaison person between the school department and 
Harvard University.  Ah, who was hired to do a study at that time.  The study involved the entire 
school system.  Ah, including the physical structures ah, that existed.  At that time I believe we 
had thirty-one or thirty-two schools and the recommendation was to tear down twenty-four of 
them and start all over again.  That was not done.  Ah, the ah, much of the report was ignored.  
Ah, not implemented through this, this period of time.  And as a result in 1987 we pretty much 
have the same school system that we had in 1969.  We built ah, a beautiful high school.  Other 
than that we really did not do a great deal.  So we, we've focused in and I will speak ah, on my 
side of the government, and it's not exclusive to my side because I, I believe that there's a feeling 
and a climate in the community that we must improve our school system.  On ah, on my side, or 
our side I guess ah, the ah, my first school budget this year, I, I made the school department a 
priority.  I gave them um, as much money as they had received in the past two years combined.  
And I have been beating the bushes in the neighborhoods and where ever if anyone, of two or 
more people would listen to promote a school building program that will ah, probably ah, 
amount to about $130,000,000.  It's something that must be done.  Ah, we owe it to the future 
generations.  We owe it to the, the present generation.  And we have to start and we have to start 
now.  I think the climate exists to do it.  Um, just today I had an hour long meeting with ah, with 
our consultant and some ah, people of the Department of Education talking about a bonding 
process.  What steps we have to follow.  And it's ah, it's ah, process that, that will take time.  I'm 
targeting the first phase which is $30,000,000.  And I hope to be before the City Council some 
time in early winter when the new City Council comes in to have that commitment for the 
$30,000,000.  But, I'm committed also to the full program which could range between 
$130,000,000 and $150,000,000.  Ah, I will be asking for the participation of citizens groups and
civic groups throughout the city to support this because although we're going to be positioned 
very well to receive state grants ah, it's going to cost the city money.  It's going to cost the city 
funds to build them, it's going to cost them money to service them.  And to supply the necessary 
supplies.  Ah, I think we have an opportunity and I want to see that it's done first class.  There 
have been cities in the state where they have recognized a problem, have built a building and 
then the people in the community have refused to participate in, in any further steps.  So I think 
you have to identify your costs up front and deal with it.  Ah, any area of housing um, another 
area that effects the quality of life of people in our community.  Particularly people at the lower 
end of the economic ladder.  Ah, Lowell is an old city.  It's one hundred and fifty years old.  Ah, 
it ah, many of its tenements that were built ah, early on are still here, still servicing people and 
ah, are quite run down.  In addition to that the influx of immigrants has put a tremendous burden 
on the housing stock in the City of Lowell.  So one of the things that we had to do um, early on 
was to resolve the existing stock.  To upgrade the code of the existing stock.  Which is not a, an 
easy task.  Um, landlords in the city have been used to getting away with, with murder.  Ah we, 
this process just didn't start.  We identi, we identified this about two years ago.  As a matter of 
fact it was brought to our attention in a very loud manner by the ah, Covenant of Churches ah, in 
the City of Lowell.  And as a result of that I think we've seen some dramatic changes.  I'd like to 
see some further changes but, I think you have to talk about that process and how do you bring it 
about.  You have to identify it.  You have to, you have to get the, the total community involved.  
The political community, the religious community, the civic community, and the community at 
large to ring to the attention of landlords that you mean business.  And by this we had to work 
with the court system.  The city has tried to work closely with ah, ah, particularly the ah, 
Covenant of Churches to, to bring about, to bring a housing court to the City of Lowell that 
would make landlords adhere to the present laws.  Ah, we had to work through the court system 
because Lowell District Court is an over burdened court system.  And when we first started ah, 
they looked on your ah, code violations and building violations as being minor in compared to 
what they had to deal on a day to day basis.  Ah which could be anything from armed robbery, 
rape, murder and you get pretty low on the totem pole when you go in there with a code 
violation.  We have met with the judges, with District Attorney Harshburger, the clerk of courts, 
and what we've be able accomplish is to have a day of our own so to speak.  So that the only 
thing heard on that day is code violations.  Ah, we have been able to bring  fines up from the 
average of seventy-five to a hundred dollars to in some cases ten thousand or more.  And we 
have one landlord now who is on a suspended sentence and is told that he is going to go to jail if 
he does not correct the problems.  Those messages get out into the community and it's, it ah, it 
serves it purpose.  But it has to be a continuing effort.  It can't end just with one um, one eff, one 
um, response.  I see vital to this, a key to this is the formation of a housing court.  If not in 
Lowell , in the Merrimack Valley.  And I know I look and I see some people in this room that are 
working on that, that process.  It's important because you need to give full attention to this.  Um, 
in, particularly in a city like Lowell which has been a home for many immigrants through the 
years.  There's a tendency of landlords, particularly where there's a language barrier to take 
advantage and to gouge um, tenants.  In this case it happens to be ah, Southeast Asians and 
Hispanics.  We've had a tremendous influx of Southeast Asians so they happen to be bearing the 
brunt at this particular point and time.  I for one feel that it's, that it's criminal.  But when you get 
into the, the court system and the process that has to be followed, and your up against a person 
who has a full time attorney who does nothing but address these cases, it's a very difficult 
problem, so ah, on that particulars subject I think everyone in this room should recognize that 
they have a responsibility.  Not just the elected officials or the city officials or the court system.  
If it's not an out cry from the community it's not going to happen.  Now I don't think we would 
have made the progress that we have although it's nowhere complete without that community 
support.  Because the landlords recognize it, the courts recognize it, the elected officials, the 
district attorney, the city officials begin to focus on that.  Ah, I have increased our code budget by
about eighty thousand dollars a year.  Ah, we could use more.  We just don't happen to have the 
money.  I probably wouldn't have done that if it hadn't had been from the response that we 
received from the community that told us that this has to be done.  I think that has to be done at 
all levels.  Ah, I also think that in housing ah, particularly in the City of Lowell that you have to 
look at affordable housing.  And I think that you have to look ah, let me just give you an example
of what you have to be aware of and cautious of.  That it's very nice for developers to come in 
and ah, change these apartment units or tenements into beautiful condos.  And the price goes up 
to $150,000 or $190,000 dollars ah, for sale.  And ah, your displacing people.  And a good 
example of this happened just after I took office.  It's a project called the Northern Canal Project. 
I believe there are two hundred and fifty-nine units representing like a thousand people.  It's in 
the rear of City Hall.  It has the nick-name of Cement Village.  It has been painted through the 
years as, as a, by some as a area of high crime, and drug transactions, And um, all types of, that 
type of activity going on that it's a blight on the city.  Well, it just so happened that in February of
this year H.U.D.  foreclosed on the mortgage of the developer.  Who had then, who had 
developed this about twenty years ago.  And there was a move a foot in the community to try and
turn this into executive condos or garden condos because of it's location.  Its proximity to City 
Hall, the new proposed expansion to the University of Lowell, and there were those that felt that 
this was, would be a great thing for the city.  It would really spruce up the downtown area, and 
they thought it was a great idea.  However, what they forgot to talk about was the displacement 
of one thousand people.  And it became a battle.  Ah, we had ah, there were sides drawn and I 
think it was good battle.  Because it opened a lot of eyes in the community.  When you said, "tell 
me what we could do to beautify the community.  But also tell me what your going to do with 
one thousand people.  To some that didn't seem to be a concern.  It gave me the opportunity to 
get involved, and to be part of a process, and to take a stand.  And it was something that I 
enjoyed doing.  Ah, we were able to get the support of many people in the community.  We were 
able to get the support of our two United State Senators and our Congress Men, which happened 
to be very important at that time.  But we also had community support.  And that put that issue to
rest.  Ah, the process is not complete but, we feel very strongly that the Northern Canal will be 
turned over to a strong neighborhood group that has the same interest in mind, improving the 
image of the property.  But to take control of their own destiny.  It's not a fly by night 
organization.  It's an organization that has a track record.  Ah, that's respected by the financial 
institutions in the city.  I should add also, that we did pick up support from some of the financial 
institutions in the city.  And that this is where a community really reaches a turning point.  Where
your going to have ah, what we might refer to gentrification.  Are you going to cater to the needs 
of the people in the community.  Far too often I've read stories about communities that have been
revitalized that ah,  poor or the elderly ah, have been moved out.  And the beautiful shops and the
beautiful condos that there's no character there's no spirit in the community and therefore, you 
really achieve nothing.  So I think that was a good example of ah, of ah, city's character, I guess. 
Because it was a big battle.  It was fought in the headlines of the newspaper.  And there was 
money involved or economics involved I should say.  And ah, I think we're well on our way to 
seeing that, that area turned around, but it will be turned around by the people who live there.  By
responsible people who reflect that neighborhood.  And I know one of the outcries ah, that 
developed during that period was that this happened in Lowell about twenty-five years ago in 
Little Canada where that project, or that housing development now sits.  That they wiped out an 
entire section of tenement blocks that really took with it a great deal of our heritage in the City of
Lowell.  Ah, I see in the future a major problem dealing with housing is, in the City of Lowell, 
not only in the City of Lowell but in particular the City of Lowell because of our low vacancy 
rate.  Ah, we have a vacancy rate of less than 2% which is effectively zero.  So we have a real 
housing crunch in the City of Lowell.  As you might assume that, that would drive the price up 
which it has.  Both in rentals and in, and in ah,  purchases of homes.  So I think that in the future 
ah, we have to be committed to, to affordable housing.  Ah, affordable housing and decent 
housing for people who are just ah, now entering into a stage of their life where ah, particularly 
young married people that, that can't afford to purchase homes.  And I think that we have to have
a major commitment to that.  We, we have tried as a city to make a commitment to that.  To try 
and be aware that whenever were dealing with developers to make sure that there is a certain 
amount of affordable housing.  Ah, housing components, connected with that project.  Ah, we 
have, there are two, one, one about three years ago, and one presently.  Where the city was 
involved in land.  Ah, in the Acre Triangle there was a unique situation where the city took the 
land, turned it over to a neighborhood group, worked with the Aetna Insurance Company, a lot of
the local banks, and a lot of local groups, to turn that into affordable housing.  Ah, owner 
occupied housing in one of the real toughest areas of the city.  Right now we're going through a 
process to turn over a piece of land.  That involves about I believe it's just about eight 
townhouses.  But it's ah, Lowell is very, is lacking in land.  We're very small geographically.  For,
we're less than fifteen miles square.  And we have 100,000 people.  So were limited the amount 
of land that we have.  But, ah, we're working with a group now called the Merrimack Valley 
Housing Partnership and the Covenant of Churches to turn over a piece of property on Middlesex
Street, er, on Chelmsford Street in Lowell.  And we're also looking at another site that involves 
about ah, somewhere between probably twenty-five and thirty housing units.  We're looking, ah, 
we're going to do a Twenty-One E which is the environmental study on the property.  And if it 
comes up clean it's my intention to recommend that that piece be turned over to the, to the 
partnership.  So that they can develop affordable housing.  Ah, they have a goal to develop a 
thousand units in The Merrimack Valley.  And I think that's something that all of us should work 
towards and be very aware of.  And where we can make an impact.  Ah, you don't have to be a 
government official ah, to be involved in this.  You don't have to be a government official to get 
involved in code enforcement.  You don't have to be a government official to support ah, this 
concept.  When the issues develop you have a voice, you should use it.  Um, in the area of crime 
ah, we have ah, we were hit very hard by Proposition Two and a Half.  And it has effected our 
neighborhoods.  We had to cut back on police officers.  I also decided to make that a priority in 
my budget this, this past year.  And increased the police department by one ah, approximately 
one million dollars.  Ah, which brought about eighteen new police officers.  And brought us up to
strength that we were prior to Proposition Two and a Half.  Which hit us and, with the effect of it 
that hit us in 1981.  Ah, those officers have gone through training.  They're now on the street.  
They're in their probationary period ah, I've been able to get them into the neighborhoods ah, 
we've been able to ah, since these officers came on to take burde, the burden off other units and 
departments or bureaus on the police department and have stepped up our drug enforcement 
program.  And have made and effected many more arrests in the last three or four or five months.
Ah, for drug pushers in the City of Lowell.  Which I regard as a very severe problem in this city. 
Those of you who are aware of the Acre understand what's happening in that section of the city.  
With drugs and all of what goes along with it.  I don't want to go into my strong feeling that, that 
we should take a harder stand with drug pushers in our court system.  Because I see them coming
back, they're arrested and they're back out the next day.  That's, that's something I suppose we 
can talk about at, at another time.  But, um, we've been able to effect a ah, ah, or cut back on the 
drug, the drug pushers in the City of Lowell .  But, it's a constant effort.  And it's an expensive 
effort.  And it's something that requires the assistance of neighborhood groups.  You can't do it 
alone.  You have to work with the District Attorneys Office.  You have to work with the court 
system.  And most importantly  you have to work with the neighborhood groups that, that ah, are 
there.  They're the ones that, the pulse speed of the neighborhood.  They can tell you what's 
going on, and I think that we've developed a fairly effective program.  Where we do have that 
communication.  And I think that, that's extremely important.  That, that communication be there.
Um, I can't speak ah, strongly enough about what I feel that drugs has done to our society.  And 
Lowell is no different um, we've.  What we've found is in studies that we've done with District 
Attorneys Office that when you move ah, people out of Lowell and you bring a high police 
presence whether it be state police and local police.  Then you drive them to another community. 
If you, if you do it in a neighborhood, you drive then to another neighborhood.  So it has to be a 
constant effort.  And it's an expensive process.  And it can only work through communication.  
Starting at a neighborhood level working up through your local police, through your District 
Attorney and finally through the court system.  But you have to be persistent.  Ah, when I 
mentioned other areas that effect quality of life in the community that we're very aware of and 
very conscious of.  I talked about culture.  Ah, and I would include in that parks and recreation.  
Um, I'll speak about culture.  First that there's a commitment in the City of Lowell ah, to bring 
about increased awareness of culture.  We have in the City of Lowell, in my opinion one of the 
finest Repertory Theaters that used to be located in this building.  Ah, is now located in our 
Municipal Auditorium.  That has not only helped us culturally, it has helped the economy of the 
City of Lowell.  We bring many people into the city from the out lying areas that come to see 
first quality theater in downtown Lowell.  And we're, we're very proud of that.  Ah, we have a 
commitment to ah, culture the city has made a contribution to ah, develop an office of cultural 
affairs.  We have about a forty member board that deals with cultural affairs and events in the 
City of Lowell and it represents a total cross section of the community.  It's a very strong board 
and it's committed to promoted culture in the city, promote it in our neighborhoods, ah, in our 
schools, and ah, to work very closely with ah, other organizations such as the National and State 
Park.  Um, you may not be aware but ah, there's a drive on to develop sculptures in the 
downtown.  Ah, there's a target of, to have twenty major pieces of sculpture in downtown Lowell
by 1990.  That has been initiated by former Senator Paul Tsongas, and working with many 
organizations and ah, civic groups, And ah, financial institutions, and businesses in the 
downtown.  And we believe strongly that those will be in place.  And feel that we will be the 
only mid-size in the United States to, to say that we have ah, sculptures of this period ah, located 
in a a city of this size.  So we recognize that that's the component of dealing with with quality of 
life in the city.  We also recognize that ah, your parks and recreation facilities are very important.
Ah, I'm proud of the fact that probably the major, my major project in terms of reorganization ah,
since I became city manager in January of this year has been the reorganization of the Parks and 
Recreation Department.  Very important, I believe that people feel ah, a special pride and 
ownership of their community through their parks system.  Quite frankly our parks system was in
deplorable condition.  Similar to our schools.  We had a evaluation done.  We were told that 
many of the facilities that were in existence dated back to the 1940 and 50's.  And were probably 
at best a real liability problem for us.  So we decided to identify the problem, and isolate it.  And 
we did that through a major reorganization of, of three city agencies.  Something that hadn't been
done ah, in the city.  I don't think since Plan E Government went into effect in the 1940's.  And 
that was to bring the parks ah, and Recreation Department as well as the Cemetery Department 
into, under one umbrella.  So that they were taken out of the Public Works Department.  And 
they were not just a catch all for political people.  And for ah, other odd jobs that had to be done. 
To give you an example.  If your trash wasn't picked up on time ah, the administration would call
on the Park Department and your parks wouldn't be ah, wouldn't be ah, up to date.  So we had, 
we tried to identify that.  Realizing that that was a certain character of the city.  And that it was 
important.  And we view that as being important.  And ah, we've worked very hard to bring that 
about.  It was a tough political battle.  It involved an awful lot of, let's say horse trading to, to get
it done.  It was probably one of the most difficult agenda items that I had, I've had in the last ten 
or eleven months.  We've tried to identify other problems in the area to create pride ah, in the 
area in dealing with litter and cleanliness in the neighborhoods.  We've tried to work very hard 
and very closely to nei, with neighborhood groups.  To encourage and to educate people about 
litter and clean up.  And we've increased the fines for litter in the city, ah we've had some highly 
visible arrests and convictions in court of people that were dumping their trash.  Ah, we are 
finding that ah, we had contractors that would come to isolated areas and dump their trash and it 
would blow all over the place.  So we set up um, police stakeouts, and had some highly visible 
arrests, and some heavy fines in court.  We think that has made an impact.  I brought a proposal 
to the City Council to increase the fine from I believe it was fifty dollars to five hundred dollars.  
And we have also come up with a very tough abandon car program that we just got through, hat 
involves a sticker system.  Where the stickers put on the car so that you know when the car was 
abandon.  We can therefore deal with the problem.  And we are, work very closely with Registry 
of Motor Vehicles, and make sure that there is a deterrent there to abandoning your car.  What 
we're finding is that people in some of the neighborhoods were buying two cars, the same variety
and they would use one for parts and leave it in the street [laugh].  [laugh] And this would go on 
for two or three years.  So you multiply that by a couple of hundred and you've got a junk yard in
your street.  So, we're looking at issues like that.  And we're very serious about them.  We want to
sent the message out to the community that, that it is important.  But I think when we talk about 
neighborhoods probably ah, the most important element is the neighborhoods themselves.  What 
they represent.  In particular the people that speak for that neighborhood.  Ah, we have some 
very strong neighborhood groups in the City of Lowell.  And we've worked to try and strengthen 
some of the ones that existed.  And most importantly to reach out to them, to talk to them, to 
communicate with them.  Ah, I've been out in every neighborhood in the city.  And I've appeared 
before most neighborhood groups.  Ah, some of them are hostile.  But, we still go out and speak 
and try to learn the concerns and problems.  So there is a one to one.  Ah, I think that that is very 
important.  And I'll, I'll give you an example of a neighborhood problem that, that I had to deal 
with.  When I arrived in the city managers office in January, we were looking at a fifteen hundred
ton a day trash to energy plant.  Now that's an issue that effects all of us.  Ah, where we're going 
to dispose of our trash in the future.  And again that will be a subject for another day.  But, the 
previous administration had been dealing with B.F.I.  to build this fifteen hundred ton a day trash
plant.  And it was accepted the health department approved it.  The sighting was accepted.  And 
there was, but there was a loud outcry from one neighborhood group.  And what we decided to 
do was to get the entire community involved.  So that it just wouldn't be one neighborhood.  And 
we had representatives from every neighborhood developed a committee that dealt with ah,
                         TAPE COMES TO AN END
J:  Proposals, and ah, we've set a goal to deal with our trash problems for the next twenty years.  
I think that we're probably ahead of 95% of the communities in the state of Massachusetts.  
Because as we went through this process I learned how vital it was to ah, have a community 
involved in this.  And to show you what an emotional issue it is ah, a friend of mine who is the 
mayor of Haverhill was involved in a similar trash issue.  And ah, for those of you who are from 
Haverhill know that he was defeated, and a major part of that was on the trash issue.  Ah, I'm 
sure he was really intent on, on a, providing a solution to the problem but it's such an emotional 
issue that it can have ah, tremendous ah, impact.  Ah, so it is a good example of people becoming
involved in the process.  Ah, I think you also have to show by your actions that your, your ah, 
your involved and your concerned.  You have to reach out into the community.  And, and I've 
tried to do that.  And I've tried to do it in a way that, that ah, my first appointment to ah, a major 
board in the city was ah, was the founder of the Ethnic Covenant who happens to be a pastor of 
an Episcopal Church in the City of Lowell.  Fellow that I thought spoke out on the issues.  
Certainly never agreed with me.  And enlightened me greatly.  [laugh]  Publicly, quite often.  But
I knew he was a good man.  And I knew that he reflected the community.  And I appointed him 
to the Board of Appeals.  Ah, my second appointment was a Cambodian.  A gentleman who ah, 
was involved in the community.  He was the former president of the Cambodian Mutual 
Association.  And ah, I also appointed him to the Board of Appeals.  And what I tried to do was 
to reach out into the community to show that I was opening up the process of government.  
Because it has to work both ways.  You just can't ah, send your message out.  You have to open 
up government and let people know that they're a part of it.  And that they're, and they can 
participate.  And there's a willingness there to listen.  You don't always have to agree.  But I get 
some of my greatest solutions at, at meetings that you discuss and you debate.  And again you 
don't always have to agree.  But it's always nice to get the side of the people that are going to 
really be affected by this.  I'll touch now on Human Services as they effect the City of Lowell.  
Then I will ask ah, I will open it up for questions.  Ah, the, upon taking office in January ah, I 
mentioned that I did go out to the community and talk with a number of people.  To try and find 
out what their concerns were.  And one of the major concerns in the community was that, that 
minorities in the community did not have a voice.  They felt as if they were not part of 
government.  And that I was warned that there was a simmering under the surface.   And I met 
with several representatives of minority groups and I asked what they would do about it.  And the
first recommendations was to form some type of a committee.  Something with some teeth.  
Something that could really have ah, some input into the what was happening in the city.  And 
that would be in the form of the Human Rights Commission.  We assembled at our first meeting 
somewhere upwards of fifty people.  To have input into this process.  Ah, we worked on a list of 
concerns that we had.  Ah, we have been meeting since that time.  Ah, I've appointed a chairman.
Ah, and we have been meeting with other community groups, one from Boston, from 
Cambridge.  And I believe from either Lynn or Revere.  And ah, we have tried to develop a 
program and a committee that would be reflective of the community and would have teeth.  That 
would have some input.  Ah, and that would have to be improved.  And would have, even go as 
far as to have some powers to bring about reform in the community and have a strong, strong 
voice.  Ah, and we're working towards that.  It's something that doesn't happen over night.  I was 
told it would probably take a year to two years.  But we do have the committee in place so that 
we can discuss problems ,on an ongoing basis.  That creates the communication that's necessary. 
And we're not, we're going to have a commission that will have some input into the community.  
It will be heard, and will have some authority.  I think that's important.  Because, I feel, that there
is communication.  And that's the most important element to have that, to have those lines of 
communication.  After you do that to create a forum.  To discuss issues which effect ah, not only 
minority community but it will effect the whole community.  This is going to be an open, open 
process.  And it will be dictated ah, the ah, structure will be dictated by the people that sit on this 
board.  And I feel that they're very independent.  And the person that I assigned as the chairman 
is a local ah attorney.  She does an excellent job and I feel strongly that it's going to be one of the
strongest ah, Human Rights Commissions in the state of Massachusetts.  Ah, we've been 
fortunate through the gateway cities program to also be in the process to open up ah, city 
government to the new immigrant community in the city of Lowell.  And those of you who are 
not familiar with the Gate Way Cities Program, it's a state funded program based on a formula of 
a number of immigrants ah, developing ah, settling in your community.  In Lowell's case I think 
that we've probably seen the largest influx per capita of any city, at least in the East and maybe in
the United States.  We've gone from ah, in the area of Southeast Asian population, we've gone in 
the last four or five years, ah, from under five hundred to somewhere between twelve and fifteen 
thousand ah, the population of the city of Lowell.  So it's, it's been an experience.  And I think it 
will be studied.  Ah, the experience [laugh] will be studied right or wrong.  Or the way that it was
handled.  Ah, because I don't think that it has happened, at least in modern day history to a 
community of our size.  I like to feel that the Southeast Asian Community feels welcome here.  
I'm not blind enough to say that there isn't discrimination in the City of Lowell, and that we don't
have problems.  But, I think that we work and try to resolve those problems.  And I think that 
you have to be aware of them.  There have been some incidences that have happened that have 
been very ugly.  Ah, but I would put the City of Lowell up against any community in the State of 
Massachusetts in terms of dealing with those problems.  We have a long way to go and it's going 
to take the efforts of everyone in this room, and everyone in the community to make sure that, 
that we are able to live in harmony.  Because that is not the case right now.  There are incidents 
that go on every day that, that are shameful.  Ah, they have to be resolved through education.  
They have to be resolved through communication.  And in some cases have to be resolved 
through punishment of people.  Ah, unfortunate as it may be that's the case.  Ah, the last issue 
that I will speak on Human Services.  One that I've been involved in and am proud that I've been 
involved in.  And that's in dealing with the homeless.  In our city, not just in our city but in this 
country.  I, everyone of us recognizes that there's a major problem.  Lowell's a city of a hundred 
thousand people.  We do have people that are homeless, that are destitute, that are desperate.  Ah,
we, I think we've come a long way in the last few years.  But, we still again have a long way to 
go.  The city of Lowell happens to have ah, I believe we have four shelters.  Um, some are state 
funded involved with C.T.I.  I'm not that involved with.  There are two shelters that started from 
scratch.  That are public, funded by the community.  In other words they were started by 
voluntary contributions.  And that's the House of Hope, and the Middlesex Shelter.  Ah, I was a 
founding member of both.  And House of Hope will be two years old the twenty-fourth of 
December.  And it came about also, by a meeting of a number of church groups in the city.  Ah, I 
recall the initial meeting when Bishop D'Arcy who was the regional Bishop in this area called a 
group of us together at St.  Hospital ah, St. Joseph's Hospital and talked about the homeless 
problem in the city.  As a result of that the House of Hope was founded.  Ah, it flourishes today.  
It's not large enough but, it's there.  It's a vehicle and it's helped many, many people in the City of
Lowell.  Middlesex Shelter is a shelter that, I should go back to the House of Hope as a shelter 
for, what we call a dry shelter where we have families ah, women and children and people that 
are not pres, under the influence of alcohol or drugs.  The Middlesex Shelter is a shelter located 
in the heart of the tough section of the City of Lowell on Middlesex Street.  Where um, many of 
the so called street people are, sleep in the evening.  We on a cold winter night we probably have 
anywhere from seventy-five and possibly up to a hundred of them sitting in the corridor.  But, 
there is a need.  There's a great need.  And there are those that criticize shelters and say that these
people are bums and they, you know they should be able to take care of themselves.  And there is
an element in any community that, that would believe that.  I think we all have a responsibility 
ah, to seeing that these people are cared for.  Many of them are suffering.  Many of them, many 
of them cannot be dealt with.  Many of them are just going to die.  But they should be able to die 
with some human dignity.  Ah, there are those ah, very important that their lives can be turned 
around.  Um, I liked it, when I talk on this subject, I always like to talk about a story that Sr. Jean
old us.  She's the director of the House of Hope.  And she told the story about how just after the 
House of Hope had started that a young mother came to her.  And she had two young children, 
one was two and one was four.  And she was on the street.  She had no where to live.  She had no
money.  She was desperate.  And Sr.  Jean took her in, worked with her.  Ah, developed a day 
care for her.  Got her a job.  She spent her time at the shelter.  Then gradually moved into her 
own apartment.  Today is a very productive member of society.  And I think that those who, who 
feel that we do not have an obligation to people who are less fortunate than we are, I think you 
have to look at it at least from an economic point of view.  And if they don't want to look at t 
from a humanitarian point of view, look at it from an economic point of view.  And use this as an 
example.  That this person is now a member of a productive member of society, and the quality 
of her life has been greatly improved.  I attended a ah, sermon by Bishop Moore.  Who's the 
Episcopal for the State of New York ah, two weeks ago at St. Ann's Church.  And he spoke on 
this very subject.  And it was very enlightening.  And I think he woke up a lot of people in the 
audience by saying, he made a few statements that really hit home with me.  And I'm sure it did 
with everyone in the audience.  That if we do not care for people less fortunate than we are.  That
sooner or later the system that we live in will devour us.  And he used man example of New York
City.  How on, I don't know the names of the streets.  But, on the whatever the fashion district 
where people spend thousands of dollars for fur and for diamonds and, yet you move a few 
streets down and you've got just people lying in the gutter.  You've got people that are really, 
many less fortunate than we are.  Sooner or later if we ignore that, that this problem will come 
back and devour us.  And I thought that was an excellent example.  And it really, it really hit 
home.  I thought it was a great lecture.  He made everyone in that room feel that they had an 
obligation.  And I think we do.  And I think that unless we recognize that.  If we become a selfish
ah, society then we indeed will devour ourself.  I think that history will probably prove that.  I 
didn't want to get off onto the philosophy.  I wanted to stay in the neighborhoods and Human 
Services.  So I will open it up to any questions that you might have.  [long pause] 
J:  Yes?
Q:  [unclear] Mr. Campbell, I think in some neighborhoods that the neighborhood organizations 
don't represent all of the residents of that neighborhoods? [lot of noise in background] What 
would you say is the most effective way that those residents could communicate um, with needs 
or issues that they perceive.  
J:  Well I think that you have to have a voice that's heard.  And you have to work at it.  There are,
I'm not going to go into the different neighborhood groups in the city.  But, there are some that 
are more vocal and work harder at it than others.  And ah, that usually reflects what will happen.  
Ah, in other words there are some neighborhoods that sit back and allow things to happen.  And 
ah, they happen.  And there are others that are very aware.  They have news letters.  They 
communicate, they meet, ah, they take, they become actively involved in politics.  I guess that 
really what it's all about.  You know when I meet with, with ah, minority groups, ah, I often talk 
about the power of the ballot.  And you know we had a city election couple of weeks ago.  Fifty 
percent of the people elected to stay at home.  What I have to say as a city official, "fifty percent 
of the people really didn't give a dam."  O.K., and I, I don't mean to be crude but, you know 
when you have so many demands in this business that your going to listen to the people that 
react.  And I think in order to send a message to elected or appointed officials that you have to 
participate.  I mean people seem to think that, that their government whether it be city, state, or 
federal.  There suppose to do everything.  That's, it doesn't work that way.  This government 
wasn't set up that way.  It was set up for people to guide but, everyone is suppose to be involved 
in the process.  And if your not, your going to loose out.  And I think that there are many groups, 
particularly many of the minority groups that, that recognize that.  And you see them gaining 
more and more political clout and political strength.  Because it's done through that process.  
There's only so much to go around.  And I think those that want their philosophy heard or they 
want their philosophy enacted then their going to have to respond, be part of it.  Fifty percent of 
the people staying home shouldn't happen.  This is a free country.  There are people all over the 
world that would love the right to go out in free election.  
J:  Yes.
Q:  What is bringing the Cambodians into Lowell? Why are so many coming in? 
J:  I think there's a combination of reasons ah, I think that certainly the hi-tech industry plays a 
role in that.  That many, there's a misconception that many of them that are coming in are 
uneducated.  There not.  Your getting a total cross section of a community.  Because there being 
pushed out of their country.  And we have some very talented people that are coming in.  But I 
think that there has been a, I would say a reception here.  Ah, feeling of a reception here, a 
feeling of warmth.  Although as I've stated in my remarks  it's not perfect, and we have a long 
way to go.  Ah, if you look at some of the communities around Greater Boston and some of the 
incidents that occur repeatedly.  Discriminatory, discrimination and harassment, ah, in Lowell, 
I'm not saying it doesn't happen in Lowell.  But I think in terms of the numbers it certainly not, 
happens a lot less frequently.  The South East Asians that I speak to feel that there is a warmth 
and there's a reception here in this community.  I should add that I think that we've tried to, as a 
government ah, to improve on that.  And to work with the South East Asian Community.  
Because I for one feel that there going to be a great asset to the City of Lowell.  I spoke of earlier
about gentrification I think that they will insure that gentrification will not take place in the City 
of Lowell.  I think that this city has a proud history that dates back to and is very closely aligned 
with the immigrant population that happened to be there during that period of history.  Starting 
with the Irish and the Greeks and the French.  Right up through the Portuguese, the Hispanics 
and the South East Asians and so many others who have come to this city.  And have ah, and now
have had a slice of the American Dream as you would put it.  I think that that's occurring now 
with the South East Asians.  I think that there integrating into the community very, very well.  
There starting ah, I know at the University here that they play ah, starting to play a very major 
role in our school system.  Ah, there excellent students.  And I think that there going to be very 
productive citizens of the City of Lowell in the future.  
Q:  Has the Federal Government assisted the city, or the State Government? 
J:  No.  The state has under the Gate Way City Program.  But it's no where near um, I shouldn't 
say that.  Because with our school building program,  because of the numbers we may benefit 
from that.  But I feel strongly that communities that do have this type of influx should be given 
some type of special state or federal aide.  I think that that might be one of the examples that they
learn from the Lowell story.  In other communities that have had large numbers settle.  There are 
an awful lot of problems.  Particularly because of the language barrier.  And you just can't deal 
with it on a limited budget.  Particularly one that's governed by a cap where you can't tax beyond
a certain point with prop.  two and a half.  
[Pause]
Yes?
Q:  Comment in terms of the university, ah, universities contribution to the social side of ah, of 
Lowell.  
J:  I think the, the university ah, has played a major role.  I think that they have  a role yet to play.
Ah, I know that, that when I've asked for any assistance in terms of research or advice.  Um, that 
it's forth coming very quickly.  I think that they've added um, certainly economically to the city 
of Lowell.  I'd say that my feeling is that there are three, there are many things that happen to 
bring about this turn around in the city of Lowell.  But I think that the establishment of the state 
and federal historical parks.  The settling of Wang ah, world headquarters here in the city of 
Lowell.  And the creation of the University of Lowell.  Not necessarily in that order.  I think that 
those three elements probably played the most important ah, role in the revitalization process that
has taken place in the [unclear].
Q:  But are there ways that you'd like the university too contribute further?
J:  Yes.  I, I think that we're in a crisis right now with our educational system.  And I know that 
there is assistance um, we work very closely ah, with Dr. Pearson and ah, and with Dr. Hogan 
and others from the University.  And I think that there going to have, continue to play a role and 
escalate that role.  Because that I see as a major key to, to the continued progress that we've 
made, is to turn our educational system around in the city.  So that it is equal to other 
communities.  I think that, that's not only, I think it's going to play a role economically as well as 
other wise.  Yes?
Q:  You mentioned [noise in background] housekeeping issues ah, specifically down in the Acre 
and the Chelmsford-Middlesex Street area.  Are there any specific kinds of revitalization efforts 
that will be targeted to the other um, neighborhoods such as Centralville? 
J:  I think that most of the neighborhoods have said that they've had enough ah, revitalization.  
They don't want the condos.  Ah, they don't want the building to go on.  And we've ah, passed a 
zoning code that we think will effect that and ah, I'm always very conscious of any zoning ah, 
change or any project that comes in that effects the neighborhood.  If there is an established 
neighborhood group I will immediately confer with um, the neighborhood leaders to, so that they
will have an input ah, they will have input into that.  Um, we have funds available um, for 
housing rehab.  But you have to fall into a certain economic area.  And there are some areas of 
Centralville that do fall into that ah, anything up on the hill would not.  But there are programs 
that are available.  But in terms of development in the neighborhoods I think that the, the ah, the 
message that we're getting from the neighborhoods ah, right now the major neighborhoods in the 
city they've had enough development.  Yes?
Q:  I moved here two years ago from California where we have many signals for stop signs and 
right signals [laughter] and when I moved here I was amazed [laughter] at all the intersections 
and the chaos you know at the ah, it almost seemed like an organization to me.  I saw many 
accidents and I have since.  I'm curious to know if there are any efforts to improve these.
J:  Slowly.  [laughter] Very slowly.  Ah, we like to penalized ourselves.  I know you did in 
California with the tax cap.  But you did it after you had all this progress and all this modern 
technology in your infrastructure.  Um, but we didn't.  We imposed it before a lot of that was 
done.  And we have to as a city um, I could not afford to prob, I probably couldn't afford to do 
one traffic intersection ah a year.  Like you have right out here this traffic intersection.  I would 
bet that that, to plan that and to implement that would probably cost well over a hundred 
thousand dollars.  So we have to rely on the State.  And we get on to a list, and the list is very 
long and very slow moving.  Um, to answer that, it's going to be very very slow.  Yes?
Q:  Speaking of traffic.  I have a question.  What are they doing in Pawtucketville  [unclear]? 
J:  There putting in a sewer line.  The last of the...
Q:  Do you have any idea how long this will last? I thought they had finished.  And then they 
started digging up again.  
J:  They, they [laughter] fin, [laughter] finished that phase.  That's a, that's a mm, a major, major 
project that we're mandated by law to do.  To tie the city in um, it's, I know it's a short term pain. 
But in the long run we'll be able to give our children a clean river.  
Q:  Well I'm just concerned about the winter and the plowing.
J:  Oh, it will be buttoned up for the winter.  Your talking about up by the, the
Q:  The Falls Restaurant.
J:  Yeah, Yeah that, they're finishing the last stage.  They'll be opening it up again in the Spring.  
For the winter there closing it down.  And it will be buttoned up.  Yes?
Q:  You mentioned ah, drug awareness in the neighborhoods throughout the city.  I'm curious 
what sort of methods were involved there.  And what sorts of methods are that are being 
[unclear] to.  Ah, 
J:  Well, first of all drug enforcement is one area that you can't really impose drug enforcement 
unless your going to deal with the other end of the problem.  And that's drug treatment.  We've 
worked with the school system and a committee of neighborhood groups over the past year.  Ah, 
to identify problems and to bring about education ah, in the school system.  Where I hope to be 
right after the first of the year bring a proposal to the city council to create a drug officer for the 
city.  That would co-ordinate with the school department and the city side of government and the 
police department.  Ah, in terms of treatment, ah, the city really is not in the treatment business.  
Ah, I don't think that there are any cities that, that presently are involved in that.  We work with a
number of local hospitals but ah, we could not afford to sponsor let's say a drug treatment center. 
We we're more into education than we have to be in enforcement.  But I agree that you can't 
have, you can't bring about one end just with strong enforcement without ah, ah bringing about 
the other part of it which is treatment and education.  And we've tried to identify that.  We have a 
very good committee made up of I would say probably fifty members.  But, representing all 
different segments of the community religious, education, um, I don't think there's a segment of 
the community that's not involved with that process.  And we have a very like effective 
educational program um, that we're working to strengthen to improve on a, almost a daily basis.  
Yes?
Q:  I'm wondering about the worker.  There's a lot of talk about [noise in background] ran into it. 
Do you hear anything from New Hampshire? And will, there going to build proper treatment 
plants in Nashua and Manchester? 
J:  It's finally filtering down.  I mean we, we can't throw stones because we've been guilty of 
some problems but, um another area that I identify really I should have brought up because it 
does effect the neighborhoods is ah, the environment in our community.  And there are two areas 
that I'm very much involved in.  That's open space.  We just turned over a very large track of land
to the state for recreational purposes.  So it can be preserved for future generations.  Um, on the 
river itself it's a great, great asset for the city.  And it's a great recreational tool.  It's something 
that we should pass on, on to our children.  Ah, it's a great economic tool also.  Because in the 
future it's going to be, people, water is going to be one of the major problems facing, water and 
trash will be the major problems going into the next century.  Ah, but on the river.  They are 
catching up with, with New Hampshire.  We've been very slow.  We, just spent um, I just bonded 
3.3 million dollars to bring the waste water treatment plant called Duck Island into compliance.  
Those of you who live in Lowell I'm sure are very aware of this, it's notorious.  But, since I've 
been in office we have met our affluent standard which is what comes out of the plant and goes 
into the river every single month.  Before that we we're violating it on a regular basis.  I'm 
committed to see that, that plant works and to work effectively and to do what it's suppose to do 
um, to clean up the Merrimack River.  In terms of what's happened since this clean river program
started um, the river has gone from a polluted river to a class B river which means it's now 
swimable.  Um, the salmon ah, the river could support salmon right now.  However, the salmon 
ladders have not been completed ah, at the lowest structure of the Merrimack.  They are targeted.
I don't have a date on that but the ladders ah, when they built the dams down below they 
effectively shut off the salmon.  And it's part of a long range plan with the river um, to bring 
salmon back.  In the not too distant future.  I'd say probably within five years they will be back in
the river.  There's also a very um, active group called the Merrimack Valley Water Shed 
[someone speaks in background].  And those of you who are interested in ecology and interested 
in the environment it's a very active group.  Their concerned about forming ah, or developing 
legislation they, they want to form political ah, develop political clout all along the river that 
crosses boundaries even state lines.  Ah, with the main interest being ah, preserving the 
Merrimack River restoring it to it's natural state.  
?:  We don't want to keep you here too long.
J:  O.K.  If there's one last question.  I'd be glad to, [pause] O.K.  I really enjoyed this and hope it
was beneficial.  [loud applause] I hope that this next meeting that I am going to will be as 
peaceful.  
?:  We'd like to thank you [laughter] 
                         TAPE COMES TO AN END
