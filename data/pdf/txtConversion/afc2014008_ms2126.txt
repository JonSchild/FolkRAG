In universities such as UCLk, folklore i
s treated as an inter-discipi

programs in the field to which historians, literary scholars, music speciali

anthropologists, linguists and the like may contribute.  In colleges lai:1:i
 
such programs, undergraduate courses in folklore seem to be offered mo
 
often either by departments of English or Anthropology.  Lacking an intcr-
disciplinary program (
or a department of my own), I feel more comfortabls

Pauel on ethics:  CFSm meeting, spring 1972
 
It has for some time interested me that most discussions
 
of the ethical problems of the folklorist revolve, by and large, around
 
the single issue of copyright.  As an anthropologist by courtesy, may
 
I remark that this folkloric habit indicates the degree to which we are
 
professionally and personally culture-bound.  The concept of the private
 
ownership of property runs very deep within all of us and is further
 
reflected in our national legal system, which functions admirably in
 
dealing with individual property rights but breaks down abysmally when
 
confronted with questions of the property rights f of the public -
-
as the continuing debates over
 l
--w-ian  ii-
,
 off-shore drilling,
 
access ways to beachfronts, highway routes and whether or no folksongs
 
should be copyrighted clearly indicate.
 
My own somewhat cynical view is that our present legal system
 
is at bottom simply incapable of dealing with the subtle ethical ques-
tions of public ownership -
-
 especially of folklore.
 No solution I
 
have ever heard satisfies me totally on all scores:  the ethical, the
 
1
5n t
 
scholarly and the pragmatic.  There just any way to be "right" when
 
dealing with this problem; some important element has to be sacrificed.
 
The copyright issue takes the scholar into the marketplace and -
-
 as in
 
marketplaces everywhere -
-
 "you pa's your money and you takes your choice".
 
And whichever choice you take, you'll be wrong.
 
However, it seems to me that only a tiny percentage of
 
those present here will ever have to face this particular dilemma, since
 
the problem of copyright normally only arises in the specialized case of
 
the publication of folksongs.  For those who might wish to investigate

and Charles Seeger's later rejoinder.
 It might also be helpful to know
 
that the Johnathaik Edwards Foundation at UCLA has set up a special mech-
anism for the handling of copyright problems and the legal niceties

involved in the production for commercial sale of field recordings.
 
I should like to spend most of my time this morning discussing
 
other issues, issues which are more broadly applicable, issues which every
 
student must face up to when he begins his first attempt at field work,
 
issues which are no less knotty to the experienced professional  They center
 
around the basic interaction between collector and informant (a dreadful tei1n
 
which I do think we should be bright enough to get rid of, by the way).
 
We must initiate our considerations, I think, with the recognition
 
that all collectors get some kind of personal advantage, some kind of tangible
 
reward ) as the result of their collecting.  They pass a folklore course; their
 
names are commemorated in one archive or another; they are enabled to publish;
 
-r;s  b.rc
i trve
 
they get a raise. 
,,those who work in the field of folklore are continuously
 
in the debt of those who have preserved and transmitted the traditions which
 
we assemble and which we use -
-
 to be perfectly outspoken and honest about it - 
to our own personal advantage.  This debt also applies even to those scholars
 
who never do any field work at all; they still must use the artistic prOduct
s,
 
the collective wisdom, fzz of the folk community as the raw data of their
 
dissertations and i
ii  :-:r±-
,
 
The same circumstances, of course, apply to other fields -
-
 to
 
anthropology, sociology and psychology, for a example.  However, folklorists
 
are in a peculiarly sensitive and uncomfortable position, it seems to me.
 
For one thing, we are dealing, most of the time, with art -
-
 with
 
the products of other people's a creative imaginations, whether individually
 
or collectively.  All folklorists, by the nature of their job, are thus
 
çtLct- 1-b
 
plagiarists to one degree or another, and it's an uncomfortable r &l
€t
n. 
Secondly, the very nature of folklore i4 clf puts the folklorist
 
in touch with the deepest, the most private concerns of the folk community.
 
It is simply impossible, I have found, to do a really successful interview
 
with an informant without discovering that you have entered into an intimacy
 
you perhaps never intended and did not really want.

I once had a student who told me in despair,  "Mrs. Hawes,
 
you told me all about how to start collecting, but what you didn't tell
 
me was how to stop collecting.
 I collected from this old lady who lives
 
down my street, and now I can't walk home any more without her running
 
out on the front porch with a bunch of new things she's just remembered,
 
and, Mrs. Hawes, my collection is all finished now."  I had warned him.
 
He had thought he was merely fulfilling an assignment; she had thought
 
he was personaj1j  interested in what her long life experience had

of relationships -
-
 fxixa friendship -
-
 and the "A" that he got on his
 
collecting project had to be paid for in some kind of coin, as I told
 
him, I
'm afraid somewhat brutally.
 
A third consideration that has been, until rather recently,
 
the special problem of folklorists is that normally we work within the
 
literate community.  The old lady who informed Sir Walter Scott so firmly
 
that he had collected her songs in a form that was "nouther right spell'd
 
nor right setten down" has her counterpart in every century since.  The
 
folk -
-
 as contrasted with the so—called "primitive" community -
-
 can
 
and, more often than not, do read what has been written about them.  The
 
point has been made before, by Amerigo Paredes among others, and it leads
 
into all kinds of difficulties.

 Some knowled: - of Leadbelly's p4son record

I once had a studentx who told me in despair,  "Mrs. Hawes, you told
 
4
.
 
the various factors that formed his musical style>and
 the pile-driver
 
personality of the man himself; however, I have sometimes wondered to
 
what extent the publicity given to his prison record affected Leadbelly's
 
ability to rent an apartment, for example, or to swing a loan.
 
I have started with an obligation and wound up with a dilemma
 
Let us see whether an alignment of priorities might help to clarify our
 
responsibilities.  As Peter Kloos has pointed out in Current Anthropology
 
(Vol. 10  5
, December 1969 "Role Conflicts in Social Fieldwork") the
 
fieldworker, whether folklorist or anthropologist, has three reference
 
groups: the group or individual he is studying, the scientific community
 
and the society from which the investigator comes.
 If the values of these
 
groups differi -
-
 and they almost always do -
-
 I would suggest that our
 
ethical responsibilities require that they be considered in the order
  
given.
 
The folklorist's primary responsibility is to the folk
  
community, to his informants.. Our just debts must be paid -
-
 but in what
 
coin?  Again, the responsible investigator must defer first to the in-
formant.  What does he want?  If he wants money, and if I happen to have
 
any, I personal'y see no reason why his time should not z be paid for,
 
just as I would pay anyone else whose time was valuable; in such cases,
 
if I don't have any money, then we don't strike a bargain1-it's as simple
 
as that.
 (
I realize there are those who feel that paying informants in-
validates one's research, but I
'll take them on during the
 L
 
period.)
 
On the other hand, as happens much more frequently, if the
 
informant wants friendship -
-
 a respectful and sympathetic ear, some
 
M ONE personal attention, dinner on the town, a memento of our meeting
 
he should have that.  This, however, is a more exacting relationship.
 
Friendship, as I have already point
ut, is not co-terminous with a
  
collecting interview. Mrs. Almeda Riddle, the great Ozark ballad singer,
 
5
.
 
once told me of the innumerable young people who come to see her every
 
summer.
 "I let them sleep on my front porch in their sleeping bags and
 
teach them songs and sing to them and show them where they can catch
 
fish and feed them, if I have enough in the house.
 It does look like,"
 
J
5.t
 
she concluded sadly,  "one of them would send me a Christmas card one
 
year or W
 a pretty picture post card some where further down the *
 
road.  But they never do."  To me this kind of situation is an absolute
 
disgrace, and to the degree that those of us who teach folklore have
 
failed to insist that our students fulfill such elementary human obliga-
tions, the guilt is ours.
 
Let us turn, though, to the most frequent situation of all,
 
in my experience
 the free gift, in which the informant or the community
 
simply shares, out of their pride in and their passion for their own
 
culture, out of the joyfulness inherent in telling a good story, singing
 
a fine old song, showing an intricate dance step.
 
We still owe them something.  And here we come to what is,
 
in my opinion, the primary responsibility the folklorist must assume in
 
all cases.
 In every way that we can, through every medium we can master,
 
we must represent the folk communit 's interests within the larger 
m*
 
m
itji society. How is this to be done?  Well, monce you have really
 
internalized this proposition, you don't have to look far for opportunities
 
to put it into practice.
 Some of you may well have more creative ideas

respected by the

e society, 
There are hundreds of ways, some simple, some complicated, of doing this.
 
We can send back our articles, for example, first for approval before
 
We can return copies of tapes, reviews, etc.
 
publication where appropriate, and then in published form.!  My brother,
 
collecting in the Caribbean, formed the habit of inviting the entire
 
village before he left to listen to a concert of the music he had recorded;
 
the pleasure the ccmmun
y found in hearing their own music played back
 
to them over a loudspeaker, he said, ix was almost unbelievable.
 Guy
 
Carawan and others have found ways to assist the communities in which
 
they have worked to put on their own local festivals, inviting outsiders
 
to come and hear their own traditional artists; in terms of preserving
 
tradition, one local folk festival is worth twenty Newports.  Why?  Be-
cause the people get to ± hear themselves, watch their own great dancers,
 
admire their own handcrafts and artifacts. Jimmy Driftwood and the Rack-
ensack Folklore Society of rural ax Arkansas can serve as modeler to us
 
all.
 
Secondly, we can insist that the small community's voice be
 
heard within the larger society.
 In the past this has been attempted
 
of books and recordings
 
mainly by publication/and by the sponsoring of folk festivals on college
 
campuses and the like.  These have been good efforts and should be con-
tinued, but they are no longer sufficient. The recent upheavals within
 
our minority communities indicate clearly that more must be done.  We
 
must insist, for example, that ±kixmx ±a television and radio and news-
papers present the artists of the minority community, along with those
 
of the managerial and middle-class society. A
 simply must not go on
 
drowning out the Nvoices of

utely no reason I can think of why the
 
7
 
principle of equal time should be confined to the political domain.
 
Lastly, we can do some real work within the public schools.
 
This is tough sledding, as every folklorist who has ever tried it knows;
 
but past failurea are no excuse for not making further and better-
grounded attempts.
 Personally, I think some hand-washing has been
 
going on.  We have stood back and complained that public school teachers
 
were emasculating "our" folklore and raping "our" collections, but
 
we've made few tries at doing the job right ourselves.  Perhaps the
 
focus has been wrong.
 It seems to me that in the past we have thought
 
about the material, the data, the substance, rather than the tradition,
 
the performer, the doer.  Why not try the strategy of lending our
 
academic prestige and providing local school boards with viable intel-
lectual rationales for hiring local tradition-bearers into the school
 
system itself?  It's been done successfully.  Mrs. Mabel Hillary, formerl
 
of the Georgia Sea Island Singers has been teaching as a Special Music
 
Harlem district of fe
 
Consultant in the/New York Public School system for over two years now.
 
There have kxma been no complaints about her music classes.
 Or how
 
about encouraging teachers to ask their children to bring their parents
 
and grandparents to school to show their traditional skills?  Folklorists
 
at the University of Texas have been encouraging this kind of thing
 
with great success for some yNaxxxxxxx four or five years.
 
Now, I am an old hand at this business, and before Dr.
 
r
ne
 
Wilgus and others cornerA I will allow that there is such a thing as
 
obscene folklore -
-
 folklore which represents the views of the bigoted,
 
the corrupt, the
 
many folklorists
 
perverted, the v
ulgar.
 Overall, though I realize that
 
w
o
-'1 +
o
 
simply do not 
, see such material and therefore do not
 
collect it, I have been impressed at how relatively small a body of
 
data falls into this category; apparently, various other media xf
fxrf
f
 
adequately serve the needs of this group of our population.
 Still,
 
there is some, and what are we to do about it?  Well, one can decline
 
8
.
 
to collect it, or one can collect it and decline to publish it, or -
-
perhaps the most courageous course of all -
-
 one can collect it, analyze
 
its function just as w one would any other data, and return it to the
 
community for its own examination.  Ultimately, to cite a New Zealand
 
anthropologist, Ralph Pidding-t
on  (
Current Anthropology, Volume 10,
 
No. 5
, December 1969, P. 518), the decision of the community is "right
 
by definition", since they x must be accorded that most basic freedom -
-
the freedom to make mistakes.
 
I realize that in this talk I have undoubtedly wandered
 
t;rk o
f
 
far afield from most peoplet w
w'u •
i the ethical problems of the folk-
lorist.
 I also realize that many of you are saying to yourselves, it's
 
not all that easy -
-
 and, of course, it isn't.
 I wanted, though -
-
 just
 
for once -
-
 to discuss the problems of folklore t
hollecting in a context
 
of "Thou shalts" rather than "Thou shalt nots", to present some of the
 
positive contributions our discipline can make rather than niggle on about
 
the difficulties and dangers and personal dilemmas of the collector's
 
specializ 4
 
work.  We can take up these/problems during the discussion.
 
I see the field of folklore as potentially fulfilling a
 
genuinely positive role, founded as it is on the proposition that great
 
and enduring ideas, fascinating tales, beautiful music, exquisite
 
craftsmanship are not the sole possession of the elitist specialist,
 
but also belong to the everyday human being.
 In this sense it seems to
 
me our duty to celebrate, every once in aqhile, the contributions we
 
as folklorists can make to an even

1
.
 It would seom to -
L
ie u3efu1 fro.a l
uota poetic and
. musical points of
 
view to examine closely the traditional skill play patterns of American
 
children.
 In this country, for instance, jump rope is almost always
 
accompanied by rhythmic chanting; clapping and ball bouncing games are
 
also.
 Even the game of jacks develops a rhythmic quality in the hands
 
of many children. Since these games are not only not taught but actively
 
discouraged in many schools, they form a level of child-to-child oral
 
tradition from which valuable clues to their own preference patterns
 
in rhyme and rhythm might be gained.
 There are not many recorded ex-
amples of these games; Tony Schwartz' ONE TWO THREE AND A ZINC ZINC
 
ZINC; MILLIONS OF MUSICIANS and NEW YORK NINETEEN (Folkways Records)
 
have some examples.
 There are, however, a large number of published
 
collections.
 ROCKET IN MY POCKET is one (
I forget the author); Patricia
 
Evans' RIMBLES is another.
 The Baring- Goulds' ANNOTATED MOTHER GOOSE
 
is worth examination also.
 
Singing games proper have diminished in popularity among majority
 
children; the tradition is still quite active, however, among Negro
 
and Mexican-American children.  Harold Courlander's NEGRO GAMES FROM
 
ALABAMA (Folkways) and some of the Library of Congress field recordings
 
have examples of the former.
 The American play party tradition might
 
yet be saved for children if it could be taught them with some vigor
 
and masculinity.
 Benjamin Botkin's AMERICANC
o 
 PLAY PARTY has all the best
 
games, and there is a useful Folkways recording by Pete and Mika Seeger
 
and Larry Eisenberg called AMERICAN PLAY PARTIES which is noteöle for
 
some forthright mid-American style singing.  Historically, the institu-
tion of the play party was a frontier attempt to circumvent religious
 
prohibitions against dancing; adults then met for evenings of playing
 
childrens' singing games.
 These were the real dances of our frontier
 
heroes and cowboys, and, to appeal to American children, they should
 
be taught in that context.

 Instruments.
 Here I have two questions.
 Is it really important
 
to work through the
 historical development of Euro-
pean instruments?
 (The answer to this obviously depends on the eventual
 
goal.)  Secondly, is the Orff instrumentarium too complex and expensive
 
for American public schools?
 
From the perspective of American folk music, our important instruments
 
historically have been from the string family, especially plucked strings.
 
or what use it might be,  the "folk" instruments might be listed as:
 
Appalachain (plucked) dulcimer, psaltery, banjo (
:
Eour and five-
,string,
 
most especially the latter), guitar, mandolin, autoharp, fiddle (violin
 
with a flattened bridge, frequently tuned to chords on the o
ren strings);
 
among American Negroes: drums of any kind including pots, kettles,
 
coke bottles, the floor (very important), hand-clapping and body-slapping' 
home-made horizontally-blown fifes, wash boar ds (f or  a snare
-d rum  eff ect ,
 
wash-tub bass (always plucked), tamborines, harmonicas and the whole
 
battery of brass instruments for jazz playing.
 
or one practical suggestion, most American schools have auto-harps
 
and tone-bells; could not some more interesting me th ods be demon
stra te
d  
for using them?  The auto-harp is played in a very interesting manner
 
by southern white "hill-billy" musicians who hold it upright and have
 
developed a method of pulling melody out of the chord positions; this
 
seems to me highly instructive as well as much more fun than the old
 
scrub- oarc' positi on  used in the
 hocic.
 '
or some of the possible
 
V
.
 
pletely limited to melodies of central European origin.  0  course, there
 
are thousa ds of pentatonic tunes a
rid gapped scales are frequent.
 
Among American Negroes the "blues" scales wi th neutral thirds and sevenths
 
are widely heard. Generally speaking, I have found that the minor modes
 
are unfamiliar and difficult for American children.
 
Among Negroes, melodies organized along responsive patterns are
 
omnipresent.  The "white" cultural tradition has developed longer solo
 
melodies, broken sometimes by refrains or longer choruses, but always
 
r
nephasizing the solo vocal line.
 In my expErience, majority Americans
 
therefore have had little experience in singing together (
or even play-
ing together).  Group rapport is weak and there is little attention to
 
or concern for blend; generally one musician does not hear the other
 
players or singers at all.
 
6
.  A final general comment.  The United states  ublic schools have
 
encouraged an extraordinarily eye-oriented culture; seeing is believing,
 
after all.  Along with the emphasis on eye-learning there is a positive
 
attempt made to eliminate ear-learning; the child is encouraged to
 
shut out distracting sounds when he is reading and so on.  Many adults
 
I teach literally do not hear any sounds wkmx during the time that they
 
are using their eyes (as in reading music); they not only do not hear
 
other musicians playing at the same time,  they don't even hear them-
selves.  Further complicating the matter is the tendency to use music
 
as a sound baffle; "background" music is used in stores, restaurants,
 
in homes during study hours etc. to screen out "more distracting"
 
sounds.  For this reason, I find that a strong positive attempt must
 
be made to teach listenin? and even hearing, and that this is made much
 
more difficult when visuaf aids are used.
 In teaching adults, I use
 
as little written material as possible for this reason and occasionally
 
even turn off the lights for a whole lesson.  Personally I feel that
 
musical literacy can and should be let go for the sake o
f the much
 
more fundamental learning experience of really hearing music,
 
I have put these ideas down just as they occurred to me; due to my un-
familiarity with the Orff method, they may be quite valueless but I
 
would be delighted to continue in this s
loppy way or expand on any of
 
the points that might be of value or provide more s
necific examples
 
in recorded or printed form of any of the mnterial  mentioned.

Dear Bess:
 
Our Schuiwerk Committee has now been asked to prepare an article for
 
the Yearbook and it is important for us to have from you the following
 
within the next two weeks.
 
1
.  Your answers to "Committee Questions on the Orff Project" sent
 
to you before the summer vacation (two sheets of questions w.th answers
 
to be filled in
 copy attached).
 
2
.  A minimum of four pages of typed draft of the portion of the
 
cooperative article as assigned to you on the attached sheet.  (see.)
 
It is of the utmost urgency that you take the time to complete this
 
now, as it represents work for which you have already been paid under
 
your consultant fee arrangements of last year.
 The final editing of
 
the article, two weeks from now, will be covered by consultant ar-
rangements for this year.
 
If you will kindly send the materials to me, I will assemble the article
 
according to plan and reproduce the whole for editing.
 
Cordially,

.  As I recall, we started out in an atmosphere of polite mutual suspicion.,
 related to a
 
guarded and protective reaction for our own areas of competency.  This was followed by a
 
sequen6e of testing maneuvres carried out during a few otherwise rather blank meetings..
 
This phase culminated in a few sharp intellectual encounters which cleared the air and the
 
theoretical
 
committee was able to settle down to much more fruitful work,  I believe most of the/dis-

I have just realized that during the past week I have
 
been suffering from what anthropoloiists call "culture shock'.
 I have
 
I plunged headfirst into a mass of complex data dealing with pro iems
 
t
hat I never even knew existed.  All week I
've been feeling like an
 
odolescent -
-
 "I never made this world -
-
 this isn't what I thought it
 
was like at alit"  The act of teaching, which is what I like to do
 
Las turned out to be a tiny-split second of contact in the middle of a
 
Lage salamaguxidi of federal fundings and projective models and data controls
 
and observable correlations and federal functions.
 And now I
'm starting
 
k

isbing, as one does a
lter all good conferences, that I had come
 
ore already armed with the amount of information and insight that
 
J have gained during my stay.  I could have been more useful, perhaps, and
 
1

 Finally, I am including two brief "position papers" of my
 
own, written at odd moments on subjects that didn't seem to come up

if anthropologists have any real uses, it seexnsto me,

 lie in the fact that their perspective on social problems
 
starts so far back that the first thing they see is the obvious, which
 
other more
 peciaiized observers may pass over*
 
To
 
announce the obvious, then, it xplanxxx appears that
 
to project the future of California education is taking

T
e e n
 omoilness and largeness in social units.
 A string of examples

 creasing proliferation of small nations in the

digress to
 
At this point I must/challenge the common notion that
 
Americans have already solved the small-big dichotomy in at least one
 
area: that of public education.  Our belief that our schools operate
 
under a system of firm local controls seems to me a part of the American
 
political mythology.
 Actually the structure is so lar

I am sometimes told that one angry parent can shake the
 
tueture, that schools are, if anything, over-sensitive to paren-
e
'!Jnunity pressures.
 I max1i recall the fact that my own daughter
 
received ten consecutive years
 
C
l
 
year in high school, in United States history,
 
ten years 1 there was no official mention in school of the
 
any other section of the globe, and no parental anger was

able to cut through the mass of administrative fiats, curriculum revisions
 
I
 
and hasty post-Sputnik legislative decisions that trapped not only
 
children and parents but school A
t officials.
 
To return to the main argument, since our current
 
methods e
l  comi ,ininir large and small social units are largel
 
atchwork
 
and  improv sationa1, since, in other words, we don't know yet how to
 
e
c) this job very well, current planners seem to be emphasiging flexibility
 
a main principle.
 It is notable that during the past week's conference
 
the individual participants have,  judging by their comments, rejected
 
or
 1ois that  got too specific.  The blackboard has been used only once.
 
A
s a gronp, we have not evolved any kind of rigidly structured table of
 
organization or master plan.
 The entire week's discussion has stressed
 
rnit p]e sc]
. u ti o ns,
  open-ended planning, experimentation.
 
I suggest that this may be our biggest problem in
 
pubtic relations": to convince those who review our work -
-
 and sm ul-
t
imately the people of California -
-
 that one problem can, and perhaps
 
nmst, hev(  early answers.  It seems to me that any statement approving
 
H
oeepL of multiple solutions may strike some reviewers as nothing
 
hut intellectual vacillation, if not downright incompetency.
 
I have three suggestions on this point:
 
1)
 That our recommendations, whatever they may be,
 
not
. be hulwarked by such phrases as "there are no easy answers to complex
 
roblems".
 Such statements, tzX true as they may be, are defensive; when
 
:
cmb inee with the widespread feeling that central planning t
xttaki
 
is inevitably either coercive or futuristic
 
n nature, such remarks actually su
e t that there are simple solutions,
 
l
it
 ee
 and self-servers just
 
2)
 That our recommendations be prefaced bN a statement
 
u
ust.  t
i-n

I
d are facing brand new problems -

 (Goodlad, along with a host of other writers from

t
hat s
uggest that it is not some great onrushing cataclysmic burden
 
that we can neither cope with nor conceivably afford to pay for, but
 
an exciting, ground-breaking, real-live adventure. 
I am e tir

nough to think that not all, but many, Californians will respond,
 
especially this,

This paper is more descriptive than projective and ii it zit

launching  either into statistical studies or detailed recommendations.

Although some critiques disliked Professor Hanna's n1taxt ban to
 
educational theory, I found it praøPLai ; regarding reading.
 It is
 
written in understandbble and non-com

points of view fairly) and presents the central theoretical problems
 
in rer.arkably short order.
 I would recommend that this section of the
 
rrori, be made available for wider rnaAtxgxtkax distribttion within
 
the profession.
 
I further support Professor Hanna's implicit view that theoretical
 
perspective should be sought before specific methods of implementation

. on Tedeher Supply and Demand in California.
 
Werner F. Hirsch
 
L.
 Summary of principal points:
 
1)
 Hard data on factors affecting teacher supply and demand is in-
possible to obtain for past years, and expensive and difficult to obtain
 
at tie present.
 
2
 
An overall shortage of ëeachers exists in California; this condition
 
is 1L e1y to continue into the foreseeable future.
 
a
 
3
)  Specific areas of teacher shortage include 1) shortages :
kx by
 
b
 
geographic area (rural and big city schools), 2) shortages by skill
 
and training (
foreign language, secondary science teachers etc.) and
 
the
 
c) a general need for more teachers with/elementary credential.
 
i)
 Recomm ndatjons: 
a) Establishment of a California Edcuation Lookout Station
  
.
to collect and analyze relevant data, including that collected by other
 
agencies than the schools, and to explore future needs.
 
h) Re-examination of teacher aalary level and structure, on
 
the general theory that some arrangement for bonus pay would induce
 
teachers to move into shortage areas.
 
c)
 Removal of barriers to enter teaching profession.
 Specifically,
 
hire part time teachers, re-examine current credential re9uirements,
 
raise general salary levels, and attempt to enhance public esteem for the
 
teaching profession.
 
d) Produce more teachers. The federal loan program for teacher
 
trainees is valuable in this context.
 The report further suggests that
 
college
 
departments of education recruit potential teachers more aggressively.
 
e)  Improve technology and curriculum.
 Recommends increased use
 
of educational television, teaching machines etc. as time-savers for
 
teachers now on the job.
 Recommends increased emphasis on self-education

 f)
 Recornendation of the eleven month school year.
 
TI HeactLoris to Hirsch report from critiques and committee discussions:
 
1)
 Education Lookout Station.  Several respondents approved; several
 
commented that this work should be done through existing agencies.
 (Com-
mittee discussion centered around suggestion for establish dnt of a
 
central data gathering and storage agency t xz9aI tI o z zi axga zxr
wUzz I,  to
 
help eliminate overlappingz  and duplication of effort on the part of
 
many state departments.)
 Some critiques proposed a network of Lookout
  
otations set up by participating school districts to service both their
 
ow n  needs and the state's.
 
2)
 General disapproval of suggestion of bonus pay for teaching in
 
c
 
f
e(m  
- tLttd
 
shortage areas.
 Strong approval for a
 ri
±e pay scale for differe:it
 
1 ve s of teachers as suggested in the Allen report.
 
3
)  Credential code revision. A generally dubious reaction was expressed
 
to the possibility of further piecemeal revision of the credential code
 
though several critiques urged clarification and simplification of the
 
Fisher bill (and the State Board's legal interpretations of it).  Hirsh s

Since an abstract of this report has already been
 
prepsred  (Allen report: page 1). I shall simply summarize some of the
 
repunses contained the critiques and committee discussions.
 
1
)
 Concept of the differentiated staff. With the usual number of
 
cautionary remarks, most critiques endorsed this concept; many disliked
 
the specific model proposed (page 26).
 (This may prove to be largely
 
a reaction to a bad set of position descriptions; who on earth would
 
want to be a "doer" at a low rate of pay while somebody el se got to be
 
a  conceptualizer"and made more money besides?)
 
However, the proposal for a progressive scale of rank within
 
the profession met with a startling degree of approval.  This was perhaps
 
the most enthusiastically endorsed major proposal advanced during the
 
entire conference.
 Discussion pointed out that such a program would
 
a)
 attract students to the teaching profession by
 
providing a possibility for them to be paid by the profession while
 
training
 (
see Uirsch report)
 
b)
 improve the quality of teacher training by giving
 
students a consistent program of practical experiences
 
c)
 draw into closer contact educators from the school
 
system and the colleges in the requisite joint supervision of teaching
 
trainees, thus helping bridge a schism mentioned in several reports
 
d) encourage credentialled teachers to work towards
 
specific goals of professionally-defined advancement rather than simply
 
going through the motions of self-education through our improvised and
 
hotch-potch in-service training program.

e) establish a more dignified self-image for the profession
 
by defining all levels and allowing all workers within the educational
 
institution to seek that level most suitable for themselves.
 
2)  The concomitant proposal that teachers be allowed release time
  
wt!, pay and a necessarily more flexibly scheduled working day was
 
enthusiastically endorsed.

This paper produced the most excited and detailed com-
mentary of any of the position papers reviewed.  In actual fact, the
 
responses became so detailed and specific, that it is obvious that this
 
paper touches on an area of deepest concern to the whole spectrum of
 
educators.  However, it badly needs breaking down.  I found it almost
 
impossible to keep track of both the original proposals and all the amend-
r
rent

 I recommend that, in any kind of future study of this
 
area to  be developed by the State Committee, ±iz  both the contents of
 
this paper and the critiques be analyzed much more rigorously than I

Since I w as  only able to Imaxin a copy of the Goodlad
 
re. ort for about an hour and since all copies are currently missing, I
 
cannot comment in any detail.  My general reaction
 
on this basis of a rapid scanning is one of enthusiastic endorsement
 
of the entire report.
 Later committee discussion was also highly favorable.
 
Examination of the specific recommendations extracted
 
fror, the report by Dr. De Mille indicates that some of Dr. Goodlad's
 
points seem obviously more important than others, but I still find myself
 
in a
e
x± overall agreement.
 
I recommend that this report be given maximum circulation
 
not only to the State Board but throughout the teaching profession in
 
aUfcrnia by whatever means are appropriate.
 
iducation of Disadvantaged Children in California:  Wilson report
 
4
 
I
.  Summary of principal points
 
1
)  There are two view of the meaning of the phrase "equality of
 
x
mixxx1txxR opportunity": the liberal which "would as far as possible remove
 
legal and economic handicaps to the  a
cquisition of education by intelligent
 
and industrious youths", and
 
the radical, which "calls for provision of ex-
periences which generate intelligence.., the nurturance of talent against
 
t
'ountervai11ng social forces."
 (p. 7)
 
While the report recommends neither position, it does point out
 
that conflict between the two "views of opportunity underlie many of the
 
basic policy issues in public education".
 
2)  Dimdvantaged children are defined by socio-economic status as
 
well as by race and national origin.
 (
In other words they may be "Angles",
 
egroes, Mexican-Americans, American Indians etc., but mostly their families
 
are hard up.)  These children show three major areas of deficiency:
 
a) perceptional and attentional abilities (discussed in some
 
depth)
 
b) verbal and cognitive abilities  (discussed in greater depth)
 
c) motivational facotrs (discussed in less depth)
 
Due to deficiency in these abilities, all of which are of primary imp rtance
 
in achieving success in our current public schools, disadvantaged children
 
fall progressively farther behind their classmates each successive school
 
year.  Further "their teachers tend to have poorer backgrounds than teachers
 
of more privileged youths".
 
3)  Data collected by the U.S. Office of  ducation suggests that
 
"orgarLizational strategies (tracking, reducing class size, adding counsellors
 
etc.) and material facilities (
specialized classrooms, librar es) apparently
 
make little difference to the educational outcome for the disadvantaged
 
child".
 (This statement is strongly disputed in critiques of the paper.)
 
What does seem to make a difference, according to this data, is the
 
opportunity for the disadvantaged child to associate with non-disadvantaged
 
children and teachers.
 This suggests that the school climate is
 
more critical in the educative process than the community climate,  (a
 
tatement also strongly opposed in the critiques).
 
L
i)  Weaknesses in current programs for diaadvant a
ged students
 
Jriciudtrig pre-schooli agencies such as Headstart) are described as
 
a) failure to produce accurate research data for analysis, due
 
to uncontrolled "in-puts" and lack of experimental rigor
 
b) employment of educational methods which are often only sim-
plifications of standard practices rather than specific techniques to
 
strengthen language and cognitive perceptions.
 
c) failure to involve parents of disadvantaged children in
 
such programs as child-training classes etc.
 
5
)  Recommendations:
  
a) "Investments in compensatory education should produce usable
 
data for further understanding"; some research functions should be built in
 
b)
 Central focus should be placed on early childhood cognItive
 
training rather than later compensatory education.
 
c)  Social, rather than simply racial, integration on the schools
 
should be fostered in order to obtain truly equal educational opportunity.
 
d) A Curriculum Revelopment and Training Center is proposed,
 
conceived of an an "educational park" with an active educational program
 
from kndergarted through high school at least, plus cooperative research
 
nnd training programs, staffed jointly by universities and local schools.
 
Such a program should be funded both my normal menas and with special
 
monies  (grants) to attract research scholars and support data gathering
 
and storage.

III.  Suggestions and additional recommendations from critiques:
 
1)  Development and funding of sum mer school  
programs for disadvantaged
 
Advantages include more flexible scheduling possibilities, smaller
 
classes
 and development of intensive training programs for future teachers
 
2)
 Critique D 22 asserts that demonstration schools have little
 
impact; what is needed is re-training. Suggests rotation of teachers
 
and administrators from regular schools to a Training, hesearch and
 
Development Center and back to the schools on the basis of a seven sear
 
cycle.
 (
I can't help mentioning, since this seven-year cycle kx idea
 
!
-:
,I
s come up in several connections, that seven is a magic number in
 
fairy tales.)

an the middle-class child.
 (The report did not touch on this obviously
 
sensitive point; this seems to i
re a real weakness.
 
3
)  Critique  x* D 2 lauches a vi orous attack on the implicit
 
philosophy of the report.
 "If one prefers to have a different conception
 
of education than that of the authors, there is much to quarrel with.
 
First, one might question that the end of education is to develop m di-
1
,iduals who are adept at abstracting..,"
 Active participation and in-
volvement of the whole community in planning and executing educational
 
tasks is also urged.
 (This critique strikes me as a valuable statements
 
of a point of view not advanced in other reports; I would recommend it
 
be thoroughly examined and perhaps developed further into a complete
 
position paper.

 Peroct ai r oat luf
ls to  the report
 
Extending
 
i
1traiisitag the views expressed in critique 2 D 2,
 t
 
that this report assumes only one goal for compensatory
 
$eems to me
 
education: the training of the disadvantaged child to compete on an
  
equal basis in his educational skills with the middle-class child.
  
If those are the goals of the majority and minority community -
-
 and they
 
may very well be -
-
 this report ae .
rtainly maps out the route, though it
 
contains more information about what skills should be  a
cquired than about
 
no w  to see that the child acquires them.  We do not know, however, whether
 
4
 
the minority communities really wanttheir children to focus on the
 
acquisition of literate skills with the same intensity as white middle
 
class children show under the guidance of our current school program.
 
The increasing development of nationalist movements in minority cornrnunitie
 
suggests that perhaps they do not.
 
Further, the stress on the single goal, as defined above,
 
suggests by implication that majority parents are totally satisfied with
 
the program presented to their children, that all we need to do to fix
 
everything up is to jam the entire school popularion into the same pattern.
 
In the reports and critiques I have read this week statement after state-
ment has emphasized that our favored children do not get enough expertence
 
in creative problem-solving, independent thinking, wide and frequent
 
inter-personal contacts, meaninful experiences in the arts.
 Perhaps we
 
should taxi develop a program for compensatory education for the advan-
taged child.
 
This brings up a third point: as critique P 2  suggests,
 
(and I wish the statement had been further amplified) the disadvantaged
 
child may actually be at an advantage over the middle-class child in
 
certain skills; the performking arts come immediately to mind.  I am also
 
puzzled by the report's failure to mention the bi-lingual experiences
 
of many min&rity children, experiences which we are going to great effort
 
and expense to reduplicate for majority children.. I should think the
 
bi-lingual child (even if he doesn't know either language very well AM -
what child does?) might be considered to be a valuable functional model
 
for his less-fortunate peers from mono-lingual families. Perhaps if we
 
took a fresh look at the skills developed in the home training of majority
 
and minority children, we might find that they are complimentary, at
 
least in part.
 
However, the fact i
s that our current educational system#
 
/it
 
essentially functions with a single goal: to deve
lop lit erate
 sk ills,
 
as this report zap implies.  Dr. Goodlad's report on teaching methods
 
describes how this process works with painful accuracy.  He further
 
points out that most teachers seem t
ho think that they are promoting a
 
and
 
multiple value system which stresses creativityX independent thin king
 
when they are, in fact, doing nothing of the kind.
 "One can conclude
 
either txtxtxx that teachers are not prepared to perform adequately
 
in the ways recommended for modern educators or that something in the
 
total school setting inhibits development of the learning environment
 
we like to envision."
 (Goodlajtd report, p. 30)
 
These remarks may put the Wilson report recommendation
 
that the schools u
ric ertake a program of socio-economic integration
 
(as well as racial integration) in a slightly different perspective.
 
In my view, neither kind of integration will be worth the agony and
 
expense it will cause us, unless the value system of the educational
 
institution can be widened to include the strength and interest areas
 
of all kinds of children, both majority and minority.  I am not suggesting
 
that we A should down-grade literacy, but that we must up-grade other
 
skills, if we are to have a mama meaningful integration and not simply
 
swallow up the "disadvantaged" into the middle-class maw.
 
based on
 
A real integration/ ijk a multiple value system
 
would obviously demand the most sophisticaed techniques of community
 
organization and educational progrEnmiirlg -
-
 the involvement of parents
 
and teachers in the primary stages of planning, the acquisition of
 
teacher aids with high literacy and high inter-presonal skills, the re-
training of teachers, the hammering out of new techniques and procedures
 
that would I
nake it possible to freely offer a choice of goals, rather
 
than Just one.  I an  not at all optimistic,
 
"
3 
4
 
But failing this, I would recommend that we frankly
 
and openly adopt the liberal definition of axX equality of opportunity
 
as described by the Wilson report -
-
 "to remove legal and economic
 
handicaps to the acquisition of education by intelligent and industrious
 
youths".
 This is about where we are now, and perhaps it is as far as
 
we will go at the moment; it is certainly better than our position of
 
twenty-five years ago.
 Under these conditions, perhaps the ghetto com-
munities will begin to work out a separate system of educational goals,
 
hile their children with middle-class aspirations "integrate" their
 
futures in the environment of the majority schools.  This might even
 
be better.
 I just don't think we o
lib
'ht to kid ourselves.

Personal statei en
.t on the needs of California education:
 
0 a
.sic research has yet to tell us dust what happens
 
at the x
Lonent of learning.  Without this information, all educational
 
encounters are essentially sequences of creative and experimental
 
interactions, the ultimate results of which, both individually and
 
collectively, are still unpredictable.
 
They are not only pnpredictable because we don't know
 
what will happen, we don't even know how to tell what did happen.
 
Teaching, at this time, is still more of an art than a science.
 (
I am
 
not opposed to the attempt to make teaching more scientific;  I only
 
feel we must start at the place where we actually are.)
 
As has been pointed out in many papers, the predictive
 
methodologies are still inaccurate and unreliable.  We do not know what
 
neither
 
will be happening thirty years from now.  Since we  i
i± kk x know
 
what we are doing nor where we are going
., it appears that the central
 
problem of education in California today is to provide a maximum numberx
 
of ways to find out.  This obviously must be a continuous and continuing
 
effort, because tomorrow we will be in a different place than we are today ,
 
This would suggest;
 i
 both the necessity for dis-
covering where we are from time to time -
-
 and here the suggestion  '
or
 
the central data clearing agency would seem helpful -
-
 as well as an
 
expression of maximum approval for educational experimentation and
 
creative encounters on all educational levels.
 I find myself opposed
 
to the creation of further control programs -
-
 and I think I feel this
 
way on associated research programs as well -
-
 which are not locally
 
based, that is, established where a maximum number of actional educational
 
eccounters are going on.  I felt the presentation of the work of the
 
Southwest Regional Laboratory by Dr. handler was a magnificent example
 
of the potential for this type of local research tA
i
-
T1
V
 
far from local usefulness.
 
I further feel that the job of the Board of Education
 
is not to solve problems but to recognize problems and to insist that
 
problems be solved.  Creative thinking and experimentation is not stimu-
lated by the ingestion of thousands of pages of generalized data flooding
 
across the desks of educators every day.  I think we would encourage
 
problem-solving by assigning such responsibilities to smaller local groups
 
for their especial attention and concern, rather than by trying to i t±a i
 
research ) through centralized agencies.
 
i
t 
Essentially then, we need to
 
problem-oriented people and we need to see to it they
 
help they need rather than wq pre-digested solutions
 
more creative,
 
get the physical
 
and we need to leave
 
them alone to get at the job.  And, as others have pointed out, we need
 
to allow ourselves the luxury of failure.
 
Actually, this basic process is going on right now in
 
thousands of classrooms all over the state; a child faced with an arith-
metic problem is in exactly the same position as we are on this com mittee.
 
We have a large number of problem-solvers already at work: children,
 
teachers, principals, professors, boards of education and so on up the
 
line.
 I think this should be recognized for the enormous potential force
 
it is.  I think the problems of education should be proposed in a context
 
that recognizes that these same problems are being solved and re-solved
 
daily in the primary educational encounter.

Dear Mrs. Hawes:
 
Enclosed are ten copies of the revised contract with you
 
in connection with our television series on music.
 
As you will recall, we have talked the matter over thorough-
ly with the American Federation of Musicians and our County
 
Counsel.
 
It is the opinion of the County Counsel that this office
 
cannot contract directly with the American Federation of
 
Musicians.
 Therefore, we have drawn up new contracts which
 
will be for recording one program and provide for 100%
 
residual if the video tape is used again.  We feel that this
 
contract meets the requirement of the American Federation of
 
Musicians and others concerned.
 
If all seems to be in order, would you please sign the con-
tracts (10) on the line indicated and return all copies but
 
one to this office.
 
We are sorry for the extended delay, but we felt it was
 
necessary to work out all the details.
 Thank you very much
 
for your patience and cooperation.
 
Cordially yours,

 (
Because they are aesthetic and tb:
 
trivial in our society's view, we often leave a discussion of this di
 
o
t
 altogether in anthro classes etc.) Since the behavior is after sr
 
expressive, it may turn out to be more information-carrying than ot'
 
tohaviors (governmental, economic, etc.)

bo made concrete into scores, texts, a substantial item which then c

 counted, filed, sorted, stored, amassed, traded, bought and sold.
 
Ibis is a way which fits in neatly with our cultural slant; we are ve
 
good at this; we are dealers with substance.  Next we inv rt'
 
freeze the performance into substances -

 the recording.
 
But it is clear that the cultural lump (
the song) the abstraction i

 We can tell this because we continu _

it can't be helped.  Pointed out there must be mism musical element: t
 
be recognized which add up in a few fleeting seconds to "classical",
 
"country and western" etc.  And then more we know about a single
 
the more we subdivide it, the more refined xxt our lumping techniqrc

The second thing we know about style is that it exists.  Already demonstrated
 
in the Itilian experiment.  What it means is that groups of people have selected
 
out of all the possible musical effects people can make some that they especially
 
like and choose to Ex emphasize.  This doesn't mean they will never do anything
 
e
lse but most of the time they will do their favorite things.
 
Cantometric experiment.
 233 cultures  37 parameters.  Play demonstration tape.
 
Talk about various parameters described.  At the end of this part of the experi-
ment, the investigators had a way of describing musical styles that showed the
 
features they shared and the features that were distinct.  These could be grouped
 
into large culture areas or separated out into small sub-groups.  Computer could
 
l
ocate data fed in blind in large geographic units.
 
The next part of the cantometric research was to determine if musical behaviors
 
had any relationship with other behaviors in society.  Murdoch atlas; Whiting-
Child child training data; Udey work team data; etc. fed into computer.
 
Results: that no single human behavior directly corresponded to a single feature
 
of musical behavior.  But certain behaviors began to group out in clear and
 
logical fashion.  One set of factors centers around productivity and differentia-
tive factors in the musical/social system -
-
size of group, task differentiation, role differentiation, presence of social
 
classes, task complexity, high gods, gaines of strategy, etc.
 
solo, midxxmtxmmm amount of text, clear enunciation, elaboration of orchestral
 
types, degree of ornamentation, xxt vocal width, narrow intervals (
width of jump)
 
Another set includes
 integration factors
 
division of labor,  (
sexual) severity of
 
sexual mores and distinctiveness of womens roles,
 
polyphony, tonal blend, absence of squeeze, nasality, rasp, rhythmic cohesion
 
(
usually attainable mainly with simple rhythms)
 
Over-riding these an energy factor (
accent and volume) that appears to move in and
 
out in relation to calorie intake and protein intake.
 
Thus music turns out to be expressive behavior that mirrors social behavior -
-
those aspects that fundamentally underlie our view of our selves.
 It is self-
celebratingon a very deep level, since it thus ex equates aesthetics with the
 
behavioral norms that are most essential to survival.
 It turns out then that
 
every society's musical style fits its life style.

o a land they certainly never made responded to the requests of California
 
students with dignity, g
enerosity, and a fine sense of balance.  I
,
 myself,
 
found that the s
ituation had s
everal elements of major value to the folklorist.
 
A kind of relaxed home-style atmosphere c
ould easily be developed; I also found
 
t
oe increased mobility allowable in the workshop s
etting extremely useful.  How-
ever I think the most significant outgrowth of the workshop setting was that for
 
the first time in my collecting experience I began to feel I was getting at least
 
s
ome pretty accurate insights to tho arcs

f folk ae
ehcs.
 
The problem of a
esthetics is ;

ins
'.
 ven the most articulate of us tend to dry up when asked to expund on what,
 
it is we value in Shakespeare or a symphony or a s
unset.  Most folksingers I
 
have known simply look embarrassed when asked what it s
i they l
ike about a s s
g
 
or a p
articular kind of fiddle playing or a good story-teller.
 
OUt by the process of trying to learn from the Islanders, we the students
 
had wil]
nil l
y committed ourselves to the I
slanders' aesthetic even if we didn't
 
know just what it was.  N
either did the Islanders, of course, but it was p
erfectly
 
obvious when we were doing s
ome t
hing that really pained the a  Most of the time
 
they responded to our attempts with gracious kindness and both covert and p
er-
f
ectly obvious amusement.  But there was one area so essential to them that mis-
takes never went uncorrected: the area of rythin.  Errors in tunes and texts 
often a

lo
ow
we
ed
d  to pass; p
erfectly obvious mistakes in dance style and physical
 
posture didn't s
eem to matter.  Rhythmic ineptness or awkwardness upset them an'
 
they would gently insist that you  ct it as ri ht as y o u  could; i
r
tottention to
 
rhythm really angered then.

the old African way almost completely died out.  However, theough the instruments
 
were destroyed, the activity itself was not; Negroes did and do drum on anythinp

is crosswise, one hand at a right angle to the other.  A strong baritone clap
 
on a hard palm can sound like a postol shot.
.  Tenor is clapped variously, de-
pending on how high you want the sound; s
ometimes itis clapped like the baritone,
 
except that the left palm and right fingers are not cupped.  To get the highest
 
-itch of all, strike the finoers of bo t
h hands together in a fIa±Seco  cut bt
 
relaxed position.
 
This type of clap ing is not a casual stunt,  The Islanders hear these
 
r
ario s oitches as parts of a pereussion orchestra; they can be as pained bg a
 
feeble or uncertainly-pitched clap as a symph nic musician would be by a ba  ;
 
tuned violin.  Further, they feel that group clapping should be balanced; if
 
there are too many people clapping in the baritone range, someone should d

over and clap tenor or bass.  But the various ranges of pitch are rarely darned
 
simultaneously; each part normally takes on its own rhythmic pattern, resultin
 
in a demonstration of another fundamentally- ffrican  us:

.g of several rhythms at the same time.
 
Poly-rhythm: Each person clapping in a group may either duplicate at
 
his own pitch a rhythm being taken by another person, or he may perform var t
h-
tions on his own; with experienced clappers, the latter is invariably the c
ase.
 
Essentially the Sea Islanders' clapping patterns seem to cluster around the
 
following frame-work:

I am almost embarrassed to say this, since I do not find an exact duplication
 
of it anywhere on i
my tapes; yet from the many variations that I have transcribed,
 
this seems to me to be the sore pattern.
 
It is notable here that nobody is taking the beat that most Americans of
 
European background would feel is the most essential:  the one two three four
 
beat s It may sound to sane like an orchestra in which nobody is playing the
 
tune,  However the abilityto feel the foundational 1-2-3-4 when all that is actual l
y
 
audible are the surrounding accent notes is a frequently observed phenomenon
 
in Africai music s Dr  Richard Waterman has called this ability to hear a
 
rhythmic base which is never uttered the "metronome sense", and he, like other
 
anthropologists tells the possibly apochryphal tale of the Congo natives zkwho
 
were excited and thrilled by the random explosions of a one-cyllinder gasoline
 
motor.  Their highly trained ears supplied a rhythmic common denominator.
 
Here is a further sample of the group's clapping style; in this, each
 
"voice" enters consecutive l

-.

place that the Islanders did not l
ike to clap except when they were singing;
 
they considered that the function of the rhythm was to accompar  (to take an
 
antiphonal part to the s
inging).  Clapping without s
inging they regarded as a
 
kind of silly and childish stunt, rather below their dignity.  John Davis, the
 
unofficial l
eader of the group was particularly irritated with me that after-
noon;
. it came as rather a shock then, when I listened to the tape back, to
 
discover

I a
ir
, probably one of the few people alive today who is aware of having
 
been put down by a clap.  Actually, this was a key realization for me; I had
 
been talked to.  Mr. Davis was not simply considering musical values; his
 
selected rhythm was an episode in a very z complex communication system.  I
 
do not mean to maintain that Mr. Davis had deliberately intended to "say"
 
something to me with his clapping.  I think that he was simply filled with a
 
large male rage at having been pushed around all day by a female folklorist
 
who kept asking him to do silly and undignified things, and he responded by
 
doing the simplest, most banal, and obvious t
 S
ing he coul' think of.  Still
 
a nessane was both sent and received,
 
This particular remark by Mr. Davis cones at nest clearly then you listen
 
to that hit of tare at half speed.

hr.  uvis, then, was not only clapping base; l
ie was clapping a kind of
 
basic enotional message.  By extension, then, the Sea Island clapping was a
 
kind of inter-group non-verbal conversation.  What was the message of the
 
whole?  I am not, of course, sure that I know but a remark made by Pro. ,

"Dear Erot er:
 
I like your ballad, and think it well adapted for your purpose of
 
discountenancing Wxpensive foppery, and encouraging industry and fru-
gality.  If you can get it generally sung in your coun1r, it may pro-
bably have a good deal of the effect you hope and expect form it.
 
Out, as ycu aimed at making it general, I wonder you ehose so uncommon
 
a measure in poetry, that none of the tunes in common use will suit it.
 
Oad you f
itted it to an old one, well known, it must have spread much
 
faster than I doubt it wi l
l do from the best new tune we can get com-
posed for  t
.  I think, too, that if you had given it to some country
 
girl in tue heart of Massachusetts, who had never heard any other than
 
psalm tunes, or Chevy Chase, the Children in the Wood, the spanish
 
Lady, and such old simple ditties, but had naturally a good ear, she
 
might more probably have madex a plea sing popular tune for you, than
 
any of our masters here, and more proper for your purpose, whichsould
 
best be answered, if every word could as it is sung be understood by
 
all that hear it, and if the emphasis you intend for particular words
 
c uld be %J
iven by the singer as well as  by the reader;  much of the force
 
and impression of the song depending on those circumstances.  I will,
 
however,
 et it as well done for you as I can.
 
"Do not imagine that I mean to depreciate the skill of our com
 
sers of m
. ic here;
 they are admirable at pleasing practised  ears,
 
and know how to delight one another;  but, in composing for songs, the
 
reigninn taste seems to be quite out of nature, and yet, like a
 
torrent, hurries them allaway with it;
 one or two perhaps only ex-
cepted.
 
"You, in the sptrit of some ancient legislators, would influence
 
the manneri of your  country by the
 r
iàrzk± xx united powers of poetry
 
and musi - . By what I can learn of their songs, the music was simple,
 
conformed :tself to the usual pronunciation of words,
 x±
x
i3€
 
as t  measure, cadence or emphasis...A
 
modern soi , an the contrary, neglects all the proprieties and beauties
 
of common speech, and in their place introduces its defects and
 
a
b-
surdities as so many graces.  I am afraid you will hardly take my
 
word for tii ,  and therefore I must endeavor to support it by proof.
 
Here is the first song I lay my hand on.  It #append to be a composition
 
of one of our greatest m;sters, the ever-famous Handel.  It is not one
 
of his juvenile performances, before his taste could be improved and
 
formed:  it appeared when his reputation was at the  t highest, is gre t-
ly admired by all his admirers, and is really excellent in its kind.
 
It is called, " T
he Additional Favourite Song in judas Maccabeus." 
00w
 
I re on amoung the defects and improprieties of common speech, the
 
following, viz.
 
1.
 Wrong olacing of t
he ac ent or emphasis, by laying it on words
 
of no importance, or on wrong syllables.
 
2.
 Drawling; 
or extending the sound of words or syllables beyond
 
their natural lenght.
 
3
.  Stuttering: 
or making many syllables out of one.
 
4.  T

:intelligibleness: The result of tue three fore oin  united.

". . .Y u will then perhaps be inclined to tink wi t
h me, that+hou h
 
tie words
 ight be the principle part of an ancient song, they are of
 
small importance in a modern one;
 they are in short only a pretence I
or
 
singing.

 The  ine singer, in the pr sent mode, sti les all the hard con-
sonants, a
id polishes away all the rougher parts of words that serve
 
to distin uish them one from another;
 so that you hear nothing but
 
in admira le pipe, and understand no more of the song, than you would
 
from its tune played on any other instrument.  If ever it was the
 
ambition of musicians to make instrumentsthat s uld imitate the h:man
 
voice, that ambition seems now reversed, the voice aiming to be like
 
an instrument.

Dear Bess:
 
FACULTY OF ARTS AN D LE li ENS
 
20 November 1974
 
I think protocol says it is improper to thank a reviewer for a favorable
 
notice  (because it presumably implies that the notice was more than was
 
deserved), but screw protocol:  I think your review is just lovely. It is
 
sensitive,  informed, and all in all the best review the book has gotten.
 
They've all been good  (
the London Times Literary Supplement gave it a
 
half-page, rare for them with an I
½
rnerican book), but yours was the most
 
informed good one.  I don't know if I
'm saying that well enough: they all
 
liked it, but you give a sense of knowing the material far better than any
 
of the others,  so your liking it gives me far greater happiness.
 
You are quite correct about my avoiding setting the field data in the larger
 
cultural context. There were two reasons for that. One was, I thought
 
such a discussion required a lot of discussion about that larger context,
 
a discussion I
'm not quite ready for yet. The other was that I wanted to
 
keep this book as simple as possible: for me, part of its charm (
a wierd
 
word,  I know, especially given the facts that it's my own book and how
 
grim the subject is, but, yeah, charm) was the chance to present on its
 
own terms a marvelous tradition, one that may have had pleasant enough
 
roots in Africa but which in this country was nourished by agony and
 
deprivation and cruelty.  I didn't want other stuff in there; I wanted
 
just as little introduction as I could get away with, then those guys
 
talking in their own words about their contexts, and their faces  (
printed,
 
as you rightly note, abominably), and then the songs.  I could write another

ANyway, thanks a lot for a good and gratifying appraisal.  See you in

Dear Dr. Manners:
 
Last spring I completed and sent you a review of
 
Bruce Jackson's book, Wake Up, Dead  an. 
I have
 
been away on sabbatical since then and may have
 
/
-Y
missed the volume of the American Anthropologist
  
in
 which it (perhaps?) appeared.  however, since
 
a quick check at the library turned nothing up,
 
I have begun to worry that perhaps you never
 
1received my review.
 Could you possibly look through
 
\
/your files and relieve my mind on that point?
 
A number of things went wrong while I was out of
 
ocket, and this may have been one of them.
 I
 
hope not, and also hope this doesn't put you to
 
great deal of trouble.
 
Sincerely,
 
P

Dear Bruce:
 
It was nice to see you in Portland.
 I find that academ ic protocol
 
(which I somehow never learned) called upon me to send you a copy of
 
this review when I turned it in last February; sorry I didn't know
 
the rules.
 So far as I know it has not yet appeared in print.
 
I find the reviewer-reviewee-reviewed relationship embarrassing;
 
anyway I did like the book as I hope I made plain.
 
All the best,
 
February 10, 1974

Dear Dr. Manners:
 
Herewith my review of Bruce Jackson's Wake Up Dead Man. This is
 
only my second attempt in this genre, and I
'm afraid I may have
 
flunked the test, as I simply could not cut this down to the
 
600 word l
imit you suggested.  I worked over it quite a while
 
and finally decided to submit it to you for such further editorial
 
manicuring as may be necessary.
 I hope this is not too much of an
 
imposition.
 
Should you need to reach me further, I am on sabbatical this year,
 
and items addressed to my home -
-
 2522 24th St., Santa Monica,
 
California 90405 -
-
 come to my attention a bit more quickly than
 
those addressed to the university.

Though essentially a regional collection, this i
s an important
 
volume.
 I
t i
s the first book-length study of any portion of the Afro-
American worksong repertoire -
-
 a body of song indigenous to the United
 
States, and the exclusive cultural property of Black Americans.
 
The musical data itself, together with associated research informa-
tion, makes up the bulk of the book (
pp.
 53-303).  Each of the sixty-five
 
songs which Jackson includes (
many printed with multiple variants) i
s
 
preceded by a headnote of formidable length and thoroughness, spawned
 
by Jackson's apparent intention to include every scrap of information that
 
anybody from any field might conceivably want to know.
 
I
t's really admirable.  Names of s
ingers, places and dates of record-
ings, and even Jackson's own tape numbers are given, to facilitate checkin
 
by other researchers;  (
to this end, Jackson has generously placed copies
 
of his field tapes in two national folksong archives).  References to
 
parallel versions, whether available in print, on field recordings, or o
r
 
commercially distributed discs, are printed in full for every song.  Jack-
son's own headnote comments cover such varied points as the particular
 
circumstances under which the recordings were made, side remarks by the
 
singers, historical and topical explanatory information, and analyses of
 
the poetics employed in the song lyrics.  The songs themselves appear in
 
the form of detailed musical transcriptions by Judith McCullough and
 
Norman Cazden, and in poetically evocative text transcriptions by Jackson
 
himself.
 (
It's harder than one might think to align and punctuate a song
 
text so that it looks even vaguely like it sounds.)
 
Overall, this section of the book represents solid and responsible
 
reportage of an extensive piece of field work; it will be picked over for
 
nuggets of information by generations of folk music scholars yet to come.
 
However, it is the shorter first section (
pp. xv -
 52) which is of major
 
importance to the Afro-Americanist, the student of aesthetics and the
 
social scientist.  Herein Jackson includes a section of his own
 
graphs of the singers and their surroundings (
unfortunately not
 
reproduced as one would hope for in a book sold at this price),
 
fine photo-
as well
 
a discus-
sion of the worksong as a genre, a history of the Texas prison farm system
 
where his field work was done, an explanation of the demands of the partic-
ular tasks the songs were designed to complement (
tree-felling, flat-weeding
 
with hoes, etc.) and a twenty-seven page chapter devoted to remarks, sto-
ries and conversations among the singers themselves.
 
This section of contextual information foniis an essential background
 
to an understanding of the "hard" data itself, for the worksong is pre-
eminently and above all else an immediately functional cultural device.
 
As Jackson puts it, "Worksongs are not songs about work, and they are not
 
songs one happens to sing while work is going on.  Worksongs are songs that
 
help a person do work."
 (
p.  31)  Thus every feature of the songs -
-
 form,
 
structure, length, timing, style, subject matter -
-
 all are dictated by the
 
demands of the physical task at hand and the conditions under which that
 
task is performed.
 
'

Where machinery supercedes hand labor, then, the worksong withers.
 
In the United States today, worksongs exist in viable form only in the
 
back-waters of our society, and most strikingly in the southern prison
 
system where the culture of plantation s
lavery still survives in part and
 
where gangs of men -
-
 mostly B
lack -
-
 perform hard physical labor in the
 
fields under the eyes of mounted, armed guards.  There the worksongs per-
form their multiple services: helping the time go by more swiftly, co-
ordinating and pacing the work so that injuries and exhaustion are l
ess
 
frequent, and venting the prisoners' passion and anger -
-
 for what they
 
may not speak, they can sing with impunity.
 (
Jackson remarks that allow-
ing B
lacks to say things in song that they could not say in direct con-
versation i
s an old soutern white tradition "as if sung words are not
 
real" (
p. 30); depersonalization of the message, however, seems to me one
 
of the crucial functions of any kind of song.)
 
Jackson suggests further:  "By incorporating the work with their song,
 
by, in effect, co-opting something they are forced to do anyway, they
 
(
the prisoners) make it (
the work) theirs in a way i
t otherwise i
s not"
 
(
p. 30).  This is an important observation, for in many parts of the world,
 
notably Africa, the worksong survives and flourishes in situations of free,
 
not forced, labor.
 It is hand-labor, not imprisonment or s
lavery, that i
s
 
the s
ine qua non of the worksong, and Mr. Jackson's suggestion of co-
option can apply equally well, by simply leaving out the l
ast seven words
 
of his sentence, to work carried on in voluntary associations.  Not a
ll
 
worksongs, thus, are dirges; and even in the roaring and bitter choruses
 
that ring out from southern prison farms, there is often a kind of triumph,
 
a spirit, however belied by the words and the surroundings, of man ascen-
dant.
 
This collection, then, represents a single sub-type of the worksong:
 
the prison worksong, the point of which is not only to help the work go
 
better but, through a host of social and psychological support mechanisms,
 
to help the prisoner last out his time; and the author gives many useful
 
suggestions as to just how these mechanisms work.  However, he does not
 
develop nearly as thoroughly another special feature of his corpus of
 
data: the fact that these are not only prison worksongs, they are Black
  
worksongs.
 I
t simply is the case (
and Jackson points this out) that in
 
the United States, under the same conditions of imprisonment or freedom,
 
doing identical types of labor, Afro-Americans sing worksongs and Euro-
Americans do not.  Other types of songs -
-
 
have crossed the color l
ine.  Worksongs remb

examine them, therefore, primarily as phenomena expressive of the prison
 
system is to leave out all the socially-supportive features of the African
 
and Afro-American interactional systems which the songs also represent.
 
Prof. Jackson knows all this, of course; I suspect he felt unqualified
 
to set his field data in the larger cultural context.  However, we won't
 
really understand the Black worksong until somebody tackles it as an in-
trinsic outgrowth of Black culture as well as an institutional phenomenon.
 
In the meantime, we must be really grateful for what Jackson did do, and
 
that i
s a thorough, socially responsible, sensitive and scholarly piece
 
of field research into the operation of the worksong in the Texas prison
 
system.
 
Limiting himself, though, to consideration of the immediate institu-
tional context has put a terrible strain  on Prof. Jackson; on every page
 
you can almost feel him trying not to cry and not to lose his intellectual
 
cool.
 I
t's hard to be scholarly in Hell, especially if you won't let

yourself look beyond it.
 If he had let himself go more, we might have
 
gotten more writing l
ike his introduction to "Go Down Old Hannah" (
p. 111).
 
"Old Hannah" -
-
 from the prisoners' nickname for the sun -
-
 is the great
 
song of the Texas pen, and, significantly, it is from this song that Jackson
 
chose the title of his hook:
 
Well you ought to been down on this old river
 
Nineteen forty-four.
 
Well you could find a dead man
 
On every turn row.
 
I say wake up dead man,
 
Help me carry my row.
 
Well my row so grassy
 
I can't hardly go.
 
I say go down Old Hannah,
 
Don't you rise no more.
 
If you rise in the morning,
 
Bring judgment sure...
 
Bruce Jackson is not only a scholar, but a humanist, and I salute him.

Dear Bess:
 
I am awfully sorry that you l
earned about our NSF Summer Institute
 
so late, for you seem to be qualified for participation, and I
 
would have been pleased to have you here.  However, the National
 
Science Foundation imposed an inflexible deadline for completed
 
application forms on us--15 February, which would have made your
 
formal application about a week late.  The National Science Foun-
dation i
s a division of the federal government, and since I am
 
sufficiently suspect by the feds as i
t i
s, I cannot fudge on the
 
date.  The NSF keeps close observation on all having business with
 
it; last year the Program Director found out that Science Services,
 
Inc., an agency that exists to handle functional amenities, had
 
inadvertently served a cocktail to the brother-in-law of one of
 
the institute directors, and its contract was cancelled immediately.
 
At the moment I can't tell you whether we will conduct another in-
stitute next su
er.  All applications for institutes are evalua-
ted afresh each year, and though we have succeeded in being awarded
 
a grant four years running, we do not count chickens until early
 
December of the year preceding the institute applied for, when
 
announcement of awards i
s made.  Moreover, I hope I won't have to
 
direct another institute; i
t's brutal work and not well paid, and
 
one of these years I want to have a summer off.  However, since
 
neither of my two books published last year i
s  going to make the
 
fortune I hoped for (
despite getting into the READER'S DIGEST
 
with an excerpt from one of them--February, 1965, p
.  82), I may
 
be at work next su
er as well.  In any case you should inquire
 
about available institutes supported by the NSF.  Your department
 
should have received one at least of our brochures, for we mailed
 
out some 7000 of them (
I even got one--see the enclosed copy).
 
You have cruelly destroyed my earthy image of you with that Bryn
 
Mawr jazz.  My faith in mankind i
s shaken again, just after the
 
traumatic experience of pontificating a few weeks ago at the Aspen
 
Institute for Humanistic Studies over a seminar of the Young Pres-
idents Organization (
presidents of business enterprises) and dis-
covering that nine out of ten of them had well developed social
 
consciences.  Where at my age am I going to find compensatory
 
s
tereotypes?

entry into academia.  I have been responsible for several older
 
people deciding to return to school, and, I like to think, they
 
are happier for it.  I like to think, too, that Nina Terebinski
 
was at least nudged toward returning to college by myself, and
 
Archie Green also--even though Archie has since displaced me as
 
the recognized academic person in labor song s
cholarship, I am
 
glad for him.
 
Speaking of Nina, I haven't heard from her since the death of
 
Janie Bright, whom you must have known.  Janie gave me an auto-
harp and taught me how to play it well, Naybelle Carter style;
 
but I haven't played it since her death.  I had it out today
 
and ran o
ver one chord, and found it wholly out of tune.  Since
 
it takes a half hour to tune, I suppose it will be another six
 
months before I play i
t again.  I
'm frantically busy here, what
 
with at least three full t
ime jobs--editing the JOURNAL, video-
taping a television course, seeing another book through press,
 
doing some odds and ends of other writing, teaching a new course,
 
preparing for the NSF Institute (most of the work is done in the
 
six months preceding the Institute--and at hand I have over 200
 
applications to read and evaluate), as well as the routine mat-
ters that one could spend all one's time on.  I am retiring as
 
gracefully as I can from the folksinging game, though I have
 
had to accept several engagements following my appearance at
 
what was represented to me as a small gathering of University
 
of Colorado Dental School people--it turned out to be a meeting
 
of all the influential people in Colorado called together by
 
the Governor of the State, who was also present, to give finan-
cial support to a planned dental s
chool.  Well, work at least
 
keeps my
, mind off my troubles.

Thank you for inviting me to a part of the country I
 
particularly admire.
 
I retired a few years ago,  and I am still getting the
 
hang of it.  One of the things  I hadn't quite anticipated was
 
how many people would invite me to make speeches -
-
apparently that's what you are supposed to do when you
 
retire.
 
Now,  in the old days  I used to give lots of workmanlike
 
talks about how the Folk Arts Program operated at the
 
National Endowment  for the Arts
 
where I was working,  and about what  I thought could be done
 
within its  limitations.  But now that  I' m retired,  the sky is
 
the  limit,  and I find,  a bit to my dismay,  that  I have only a
 
few things to say,  really.  I think that's true of most
 
people;  it takes a long time to get pretty sure about
 
anything.  So as we get older we tend to take our one or two
 
or three  little  ideas that we' ve think are maybe worth
 
repeating and we dress them up differently every other day
 
and try to make them look smart  and fashionable,  and then
 
here we come again with another speech or another article.
 
I need to tell you too that this  is really my first trip
 
to Boone  (
though I' ve known a lot of people -
-
 many of them
 
marvellous artists -
-
 who were born and raised within
 
spitting distance of this very spot) .
 But  I do not claim to
 
be any kind of expert  on Appalachia or Appalachian-ness.  I do
 
know,  without ever having met you,  that as a group you are
 
highly sensitive and your feelings are probably easily hurt.
 
I know this because  I have never yet  spoken in all these
 
years to an audience whose feelings were not exquisitely
 
sensitive,  and I have come to believe that this is not
 
because of my audiences but because of what  I always talk
 
about -
-
 the crucial  importance of the arts that are
 
traditional to the particular people  I find myself among.
 
That's what  I always talk about wherever I go.  And,
 
sadly,  wherever  I go  I find that almost everybody listening
 
has extremely mixed feelings about their own traditional art
 
forms.  Sometimes they are even downright ashamed of them,
 
almost always a little bit embarrassed by them.  "That old
 
stuff? Art? Nah.  Art  is pure white stone statues,  or it's
 
something Shakespeare said,  or it's a lady dancing on her
 
toes.  It' s not that old by-goner sitting on the back porch
 
playing that  screechy old fiddle.
 It's not old lady Whoozis
 
forever making those popcorn bedspreads."
 
You know,  the first time  I ever visited Hawaii,  the nice
 
people  from the arts  council who met me at the airplane told
 
me that they had fixed up tickets  for me to go to the
 
Honolulu opera house that evening to hear La Traviata so that
 
I would understand right away that Hawaii had real art--
fresh from Milan -
-
 not  just hulas and ukeleles and the most
 
magnificent quilts that anybody in the world ever made.
 
But  still,  everywhere  I go,  I keep on and on talking
 
about the  local art  forms and the home-based artists and why
 
I truly believe they are not only important but essential to
 
the quality of life in that place.  I' m not being sentimental
 
about this.  I' m a tough-minded old lady,  and I believe deeply
 
in what  I am saying.  Let me try to explain what  I mean in
 
more concrete terms,  and I think  I'll start by talking about
 
how it was  for me when  I was a little girl.
 
That was more than seventy years ago  (I was born in
 
1921),  and my family lived in east Texas out  in the
 
countryside.  Where we  lived is now a suburb of Dallas,  but
 
then it was pretty remote,  and so my mother decided to teach
 
me at home.  She taught me Latin and piano and medieval
 
history and lots of unusual things,  but  she also taught me
 
the day-to-day things.  She taught me how to sew,  for example.
 
I remember sitting with her rag bag that was  full of scraps
 
of material from all the clothes mother had made  for us,  and
 
sort of folding doll  clothes out  of them.
 
But then  I had to learn how to do it right.  My mother
 
was  a great believer  in doing things right.  She gave me a
 
Latin motto  (
she gave all of us  children different mottos)
 
mine was  "Faciendo ediscere  facere" which means  "By doing you
 
learn to do" and she would tell me "By reading you learn to
 
read",  "by dancing you learn to dance",  "
 by sewing you learn
 
to sew".  So I learned how to work her old foot-treadle Singer
 
sewing machine.  She would give me the front page of the
 
Dallas Morning News after she and father had finished with
 
it,  and -
-
 with the machine unthreaded--  I would sew up and
 
down the newsprint columns and around the photographs until  I
 
learned just how to sew a straight line and turn a neat
 
corner.  And then I had to learn how to embroider -
-
 because
 
that's what all the little girls did in my part of the
 
country -
-
 at  least  little Anglo girls  like me.
 
Because every November,  my mother and I would go to the
 
dime store downtown and I would get to pick out the presents
 
I was going to make  for Christmas,  secretly,  when nobody was
 
looking.  In those days you could buy dresser scarves or table
 
napkins or bridge table covers that had designs stencilled on
 
them with blue dots.  And embroidering was to cover those blue
 
dots with French knots and lazy daisies and outline stitches
 
in different colors so that  it would turn out to be a special
 
present that you yourself had a hand in.
 
So after  I had picked out the things  I wanted to
 
embroider for my sister or my mother or my aunts,  I would go
 
to the embroidery thread counter and pick out the colors.
 
That was the best part.  There was always white embroidery
 
thread there,  I remember,  and lots of pastels -
-
 pale green,
 
pink,  lavender,  yellow,  pale blue,  and sometimes black and
 
sometimes  red and sometimes bright green.  I agonized.  I never
 
had enough money for all the colors  I wanted.  One year  I
 
remember coming home with red and black and light green and
 
pink and lavender,  and my older sister said,  "Honey,  you
 
don't want to use that red and black.  They won't blend.  You
 
want  it to blend and be pretty."
 And I thought  it might be
 
pretty,  but  I tried it,  and it wasn't.  It didn't blend,  and I
 
had to pick it all out and start again.
 
Now when  I remember what was  in our ragbag -
-
 scraps
 
from my dresses and from the shirts and blouses mother made
 
for the others,  and her own dresses and aprons and good
 
pieces  from father's old business  shirts -
-
 those pieces of
 
cloth weren't  scarlet or magenta or bright green or black.
 
They were  lavender and pink and light blue,  and they were
 
solid colors or small prints.  I guess  you could say we were
 
conservative.
 
And every once  in a while my mother would load the
 
ragbag up into the car and we would go to see the quilt  lady
 
who lived about two miles  from us outside of Dallas,  in east
 
Texas.  Now this was during the depression and everybody did
 
what they knew how to do to make a few cents,  and this  lady
 
really did know how to make quilts.  Mother and she would look
 
over all the scraps,  and she would get out all her patterns
 
she had cut out of the newspapers,  and they would decide
 
which pattern would look best with the material we had.  The
 
idea was,  you see,  not to have to buy material;  nobody could
 
afford that  in those days.  But this  lady could take all our
 
old bits and pieces and make absolutely beautiful quilts out
 
of them.  Mother always  said she was a real artist at her
 
work.
 
So all the quilts on our beds that we  slept under every
 
night turned out to be blendy.  They were made out of the
 
clothes we wore and the colors we had chosen and the
 
aesthetic principles we had learned -
-
 neat  corners,  straight
 
lines,  balanced curves,  precise workmanship,  unemphasized
 
dividing lines,  subtle color gradations.  It's actually a
 
wonderful aesthetic system -
-
 around the world it has
 
produced beautiful effects  from 19th century Italian
 
paintings to British flower gardens to Chinese porcelains to
 
east Texas quilts,
 
But  although the quilt  lady,  as everybody I knew called
 
her,  was an artist,  according to my mother,  it gradually
 
became clear that  I wasn't.  Sewing just didn't really
 
interest me.  I learned those things that an east Texas Anglo
 
little girl needed to know,  but that was  it.  I didn't become
 
an artist.  On the other hand those aesthetic principles  I
 
learned as a child have never left me.  At home at this moment
 
there is a basket by my chair full of woven squares  I have
 
been putting together for years  for a baby blanket,  and I
 
smile sometimes over them,
 because with the world of color
 
and gaiety to choose  from I have picked out white and pale
 
green and the sweetest pale yellow to make those squares out
 
of,  because  I thought they would just work up so pretty.
 
But nobody told me  I was  learning an aesthetic system;
 
nobody ever thought about  it that way at all -
-
 I was  just
 
learning how to do things the right way.  And you and I have
 
still not  fully
 explored what was happening to me.  Notice,
 
for example,  that although my mother considered it essential
 
for me to learn the principles of sewing,  she did not
 
consider it especially important to show me the rudiments of
 
basketry or of pottery.  Indeed I doubt that  she knew them
 
herself.
 
Now,  what you do not  learn or experience as a child
 
marks you as distinctively as what you do.  I am sorry to say
 
that as a child I didn't know any Mexican or Black or Indian
 
children who were neighbors to me in east Texas,  but  I can
 
assure you it  is  likely they would have had instruction in
 
other aesthetic activities as well as  sewing.  A recent
 
research project  in the county of Mount Pleasant,  South
 
Carolina,  where the ancient African basketry tradition
 
connected with rice growing still thrives,  tells us that
 
every single African-American man,  woman and child in that
 
county past the  lap baby stage can make a basket.  They can.
 
Notice they all don't,  but they can.  And I can't.  I don't
 
have any idea how to start.  You could lock me in the tower
 
all night with a bale of straw to weave like the princess  in
 
the  fairy tale and you would have to chop my head off the
 
next morning because  I wouldn't have even begun.  Basket
 
making was not part of the artistic tradition in which I was
 
brought up.  Some might even say I was culturally deprived -
-
even though I could play the piano,  the poor little thing,
 
she  can't even make a basket bottom!
 
And then consider the various color palettes that are in
 
use around the world.  American Indians often emphasize clear
 
primary colors -
-
 blue,  red,  yellow -
-
 each of which can
 
represent a different  direction -
-
 east,  north,  south,  west,
 
up,  down.
 They point a way and make distinctions between
 
elements  rather than shading things together.  African-
American quilters often emphasize movement and energy,  with
 
brilliant  color-soaked contrasts that almost vibrate to the
 
eye:  magenta and lime green and sulphur yellow and lots of
 
black to set  it all off.  The colorful visual playfulness of
 
many Mexican-American traditions depends on the use of
 
shocking pink and scarlet and peacock blues.
 
A few years back in the state of Arizona,  Jim Griffith,
 
the  state  folklorist,  noted that the very hottest,  most
 
creative pinata maker in town had been turning out awfully
 
uncharacteristic pinatas -
-
 all white and baby blue and pale
 
pale pink.  Now,  this artist was  so highly thought of in
 
Tucson that the University of Arizona football team had
 
several times commissioned him to make mammoth pinatas of the
 
Wildcats or the Roadrunners -
-
 whatever their emblem was -
-
and those pinatas had ridden in honor in the victory parades.
 
Jim became increasingly disturbed by this apparent  shift
 
in aesthetic sensibilities of the Mexican-American community,
 
for it turned out that other local pinata makers were also
 
abandoning their usual palettes of electric blue,  scarlet,
 
lime green and shocking pink.  Everybody was going absolutely
 
and uncharacteristically pastel all of a sudden,  and Jim got
 
really curious  as to what on earth was going on,  what  factors
 
had stimulated this really major aesthetic change.  Was  it a
 
kind of art nouveau idea coming up north from Mexico? Was  it
 
some sort of attempt to imitate another possibly more
 
glamorous  aesthetic?
 Had the art teachers with their color
 
wheels gotten in there and persuaded the pinata makers to
 
work for gentler,  more melding effects  instead of looking
 
across the color spectrum for brilliance and contrast?
 
The answer turned out to be pretty simple -
-
 awful,  but
 
simple.  The wholesale paper company that  serviced almost all
 
of the state of Arizona had determined that the major tissue
 
papers that were being bought  in bulk across the entire state
 
were light-colored;  department and gift  stores everywhere
 
used white,  pale blue,  or pale pink tissues to wrap their
 
merchandise  in,  and they were the big-time quantity
 
consumers.  The  sales of burnt orange,  emerald,  crimson,
 
aquamarine,  royal purple tissue papers were negligible by
 
contrast,  so -
-
 well,  it was a good hard business problem and
 
a good hard business decision got made.  No more bright
 
colored tissue paper;  we can't afford it;  it doesn't make a
 
dime.  Now,  just  for a moment,  let us together look privately
 
into our own silent,  art-loving and profit-loving hearts and
 
think -
-
 if I were a big-time paper manufacturer in that part
 
of the country,  and times were hard,  what would I do?
 
Well,  what Jim did,  not being a paper manufacturer but a
 
practical man and a first-class  folklorist,  was to stockpile
 
in his own private closet  in his own private living room a
 
number of  industrial-sized rolls of a full range of
 
brilliant,  color-soaked tissue papers.  And any pinata maker
 
in southern Arizona could come by and quietly take off a yard
 
or a mile as needed of any or all of the colors,  according to
 
his  own aesthetic taste.  And what do you know -
-
 things  just
 
began to sort of subside back to normal;  there were fewer and
 
fewer white or pastel pinatas and more and more lively multi-
colored ones,  and pretty soon everybody had forgotten about
 
the great  southern Arizona color change.
 
But what  I learned from it was that our cultural system
 
is a very powerfully integrated system,  and it tends to work
 
all of a piece,  and what happens here affects what happens
 
there.  And I kept and keep on thinking of how many thousands
 
of similar tiny dramas are being acted out every day in
 
thousands of different  subtly injurious ways  in thousands of
 
American places.  And I began to believe we must reflect
 
together more frequently and in greater depth on how we might
 
mitigate the massive  forces  in our nation that grind away
 
steadily and often quite unconsciously towards artistic
 
conformity and cultural uniformity.
 
So far I have been trying to demonstrate what folk arts
 
are and how they quietly emerge from the aesthetic patterns
 
expressive of particular folk groups.  And what are folk
 
groups? They are simply groups that define themselves as
  
themselves by virtue of sharing one or more common factors
 
ethnicity,  occupation,  location,  language,  or religion,
 
perhaps.  (It's easier sometimes to think about this if you
 
recall how you might  choose to remember a person you  just met
 
-
-
 by virtue of where he lives,  what  she does,  what church he
 
attends or what  language she speaks.  Most of us belong at one
 
time or another to more than one  folk group.)
 
And every person who is a member of a folk group is
 
exposed to  (or you might  say "learns")  its particular
  
aesthetic pattern and carries  it with him as a point of
  
aesthetic reference for the rest of her life. This  is why the
 
current emphasis on "multi-culturalism"  in the educational
 
agenda,  as badly defined and confusing as the discussion so
 
often is,  is of such vital  importance.  Every person,
 
especially every schoolchild,  regardless of the aesthetic
 
system of his or her family or community,  needs to see that
 
system treated with respect and appreciation and genuine
 
understanding.  When this happens,  individuals can allow
 
themselves to be open to other aesthetic experiences and
 
become gladdened by variety rather than frightened or angered
 
or bored.  Each new aesthetic exposure then serves to broaden
 
and deepen our personalities,  making us more wise,  more
 
humane,  more subtle.
 
It  is astonishing how deep these early experiences  lie
 
and how potent they are.  Some years ago I was attending a
 
concert that presented a sampling of the musicians  scheduled
 
to appear at a large multi-ethnic festival in Los Angeles.
 
It was quite a show.  There were  scores of musical
 
performances  from all around the world;  kilted Scots
 
bagpipers marched down the center aisle;  African drummers
 
thundered from the stage,  mariachi orchestras blazed and
 
trumpeted,  gospel choirs  filled the enormous hall with
 
sonorities.  I was  in my element,  making knowledgable remarks
 
to my companions,  (showing off,  frankly),  thrilling to each
 
extraordinary set of sounds.  The whole thing went on for
 
hours,  each performance more special than the last,  until
 
almost at the weary end three slightly bedraggled looking men
 
carrying a banjo,  a guitar and a string bass  shambled out on
 
the  stage,  fussed around rather unprofessionally for a minute
 
or two and then struck up --"Red Wing".
 
"Red Wing!" The corniest of all  songs,  the one you never
 
know whether you should sing in public or not,  it's text is
 
so ultimately silly.  But they played "Red Wing",  and my heart
 
absolutely melted.  The most extraordinary sense of total
 
well-being came over me,  I was comforted,  I was  secure,  I was
 
home,  that was my song.  And you know what -
-
 I was
 
embarrassed about  it!  I had to admit to myself that  if  I had
 
seen a copy of the program ahead of time,  "Red Wing" would
 
have been the last on my list of possible favorites.  I had
 
moved so far away from my East Texas roots,  I had forgotten
 
where they lay.  But my roots hadn't  forgotten.  There they
 
were,  ready to remind me who I am and where  I come from.
 
So that,  ultimately,  is what this thing called multi-
cultural education and multi-cultural entertainment that  so
 
many people worry over is  really about.  It's about making
 
sure that everybody on the one hand gets to check back to his
 
own roots every once  in a while  for comfort and dignity and
 
presence and on the other hand gets a chance to revel in the
 
glories of the  inventiveness that other cultures have to
 
share with us.
 
It all reminds me of my dear old friend Dewey Balfa,  the
 
great Cajun fiddler from Lafayette,  Louisiana.  Ever since  I
 
knew him,  when  I asked him what he would most  like to be
 
doing,  he used to say,  "Oh,  what  I really want to do is to
 
teach the children in the  schools how Cajun music works and
 
show them how beautiful it  is".  And then he would tell me all
 
over again how he used to get whippings  for speaking Cajun
 
(which is a dialect of French)  in the schoolyard when he was
 
a little boy and how he would read in the paper that Cajun
 
music sounded like the yowling of cats.  And his eyes would
 
fill with tears.
 
Many people from France,  Canada,  and even a few terrible
 
bureaucrats  from the terrible federal government  like Ralph
 
Rinzler and me -
 joined in a major campaign some twenty years
 
ago not  just to have Cajun music presented in the schools of
 
Louisiana but to have the  language and the arts and the
 
aesthetic system of Cajun culture included in the base-line
 
materials that Cajun children were given to learn and study
 
in the schools that their Cajun parents were  supporting with
 
their Cajun tax money.  And after a year or so of this,  one
 
day when  I called Dewey on the long-distance telephone to ask
 
how things were going,  he said,  "Oh,  it's  just wonderful.
 
They' re letting me bring my Cajun band into the music classes
 
right across the state,  and I can show how each instrument
 
plays a rhythm that's different to the others and how the
 
different voices of the instruments sing high and low,  and
 
the children  just  love it and the music teachers  love it
 
But,  Ms.  Bess,  I have to say I' m beginning to worry about
 
something."
 
And I said,  "Mr.  Dewey,  what are you worrying about
 
now?" And he said,  "You know,  Ms Bess,  I look at these Cajun
 
children and I think how they oughtn't  just to learn about
 
Cajun music.  There's  lots of other kinds of music in
 
Louisiana -
-
 there's  Italian music and symphony music and
 
South American music and our Cajun children ought to have the
 
chance to learn about all of them.  Don't you think so?"
 And
 
I said,  "Yes,  Mr.  Dewey,  you' re right.  That's the next thing
 
we have to start to work on."
 
You  see how it works?
 There's a kind of playground
 
justice and sense of order here.  What we have to keep doing
 
is  just  seeing to it that everybody gets their turn and
 
nobody gets too terribly much more than their share.  But the
 
pinch comes when we discover that that may mean giving up
 
just a bit of the prime time on the media and in the schools,
 
time that  is typically reserved for popular music  (
that makes
 
a lot of people a lot of money),  advertising art  (
that does
 
the  same),  and classical European art  forms  (
that make most
 
people  feel high-toned and properly educated.)  And that  is
 
and will continue to be a really tough battle;  don't ever
 
under-estimate it.
 
For,  as  long as  I can remember,  the real problem facing
 
the  folk and traditional arts of all peoples  is what has been
 
called in another context,  the triviality barrier.  It  is
 
truly a stunner.  You see,  no matter how delicate the color
 
palettes,  how refined the weaving techniques,  how imaginative
 
the designs of a Paiute  Indian coiled tray weaver -
-
 please
 
notice  I don't  call her a basket-maker -
-
 her work still
 
carries with it the stigma of being an artistic pursuit that
 
many people feel is  really only appropriate for children,
 
though I doubt any of them ever tried to do it.  Indeed
 
"Basket Making  101" has become a synonym for a snap college
 
course  for boneheads.
 
And of course,  "everybody" knows that nobody paid any
 
real attention to country music  (except  for the fellows who
 
made millions off of it  in Nashville)  until a "real symphony
 
composer"  like Aaron Copland,  came along and wrote that
 
wonderful  "Rodeo" ballet music based on some old banjo tunes
 
he  found in the Archive of American Folk Songs at the Library
 
of Congress.
 
The triviality barrier is higher and,  I do believe,  even
 
more  impervious to attack,  than the Berlin wall.  At  least,
 
I' ve been scratching away at  it my whole lifetime and I don't
 
see a lot  of marks on it.  But  I can tell you that there's a
 
new and very interesting development -
-
 some young people are
 
beginning intentionally and deliberately to select  careers  in
 
the traditional arts over the other options they could
 
perfectly well pursue.  They do not  feel themselves doomed by
 
virtue of birth to practice a traditional art -
 they choose
 
to pursue the arts of their ancestors over a host of other
 
good possibilities.  For example,  in Arizona,  a young Native
 
American graduate music student  I know has decided to explore
 
further the Woodland flute tradition he learned as a boy
 
rather than undertake addditional conventional training in
 
music composition.  Maybe he will return and get his Music Ed
 
degree eventually,  maybe not -
-
 in the meantime Martha Graham
 
invited him to prepare a score for her company -
-
 but he had
 
an option to go another way and he chose it.  In South
 
Carolina an African-American low country basket weaver anci
 
mother of three has decided to forgo further graduate classes
 
in education in order to pursue her weaving career full time.
 
Examples of her work have been purchased by art museums
 
around the world;  she  is an extraordinary artist.  Maybe such
 
decisions  represent not  just a scratch but even a tiny crack
 
in that wall that has  loomed so high for so long.
 
For there are riches to be  found on both sides of the
 
triviality barrier.  I' ve always  liked "Rodeo" and I' ve also
 
delighted in the original recording by a Virginia banjo
 
picker that Copland drew from in his remarkable score.  In
 
fact,  on the day he came to the Library of Congress to
 
listen,  I helped Mr.Copland find the tunes he eventually
 
used.  And so to me  "Rodeo"  is  just another version of "Hop
 
Up,  My Ladies" or "Miss McCloud's Reel" if you prefer to call
 
it that.  -
 no more,  no less.  It would be so marvellous  if
 
more art  lovers  could recognize that the sharp,  distinctive,
 
stylistic excitement,  just  reeking of Appalachia and no place
 
else in the whole world,  and embodied in that particular
 
tune,  could only have been invented and perfected by persons
 
steeped in that particular musical tradition,  not in the
 
larger,  more diffuse,  and perhaps grander purview enjoyed by
 
Mr . Copland.
 
Popular and fine arts try to speak across cultural or
 
geographic boundaries to much larger audiences,  and so their
 
message is often diluted.  Traditional  folk arts  speak of and
 
for their particular group,  and so their particular aesthetic
 
styles are particularly distinctive -
-
 they often even come
 
to represent the group as a whole.,  Think,  for instance,  of
 
Hawaiian hulas,  African American blues,  Pueblo pottery.  There
 
is nothing whatever to prevent,  say,  an Alaskan Eskimo from
 
learning to hula,  but  it will remain a Hawaiian hula that has
 
been learned,  not an Eskimo hula.
 
For in the traditional  folk arts,  as  I again tried to
 
demonstrate in my original personal story,  there are various
 
kinds of artists.  From the point of view of the folk group
 
itself,  probably the most  culturally valuable are those who
 
have been brought up within the tradition,  learning thbe arts
 
as they live the life that the art  itself stems  from and
 
represents.  Such people are sometimes  called "tradition
 
bearers" or "culture bearers".  They exist  in other fields of
 
art as well,I have always thought that Nadia Boulanger must
 
have been a tradition bearer in the field of classical piano.
 
Then there are those  folk artists who have been brought
 
up within a tradition and who determine that they will
 
develop it  into new ways.  They are the  innovators,  the  "new
 
wavers".  Sometimes they bring it off and create a refreshing
 
and exciting new artistic style that becomes accepted by
 
others and gets added into the cultural repertoire.  Bluegrass
 
is a good example.  More often,  they don't,  and they sink into
 
a noble and honorable oblivion,  unheard of by future
 
generations.
 
Finally,  there are practitioners who have not been
 
brought up in the tradition but who determine,  at  some point
 
in their lives,  to learn it.  This  is a natural human impulse
 
-
-
 to admire deeply,  to the point of commitment -
-
 somebody
 
else's art  form,  and it  should never be denigrated.  Such
 
practices  stretch the aesthetic muscles and increase the
 
humane and tender side of an artist's  character.  The outside
 
22
 
L
 
learner -
-
 the  "revivalist",  the  "folky",  the "interpreter"
 
must,  however,  remember that the oncoming phase,  the future
 
development of the art  form she has adopted will arise  from
 
the authentic artists -
-
 the in-born,  in-bred culture
 
carriers,  whether old-fashioned conservatives or young
 
radicals.  TRhe  local Armenian oudist  is  likely to stay
 
working awqay at his music long after the eclectic young
 
outside learner is off trying his hand at Bolivian panpipes
 
or Appalachian hoedowns.
 
I sometimes tell people that  folk arts  are the arts that
 
help you know where you are -
-
 where you are  
-
-
 when you get
 
off the airplane or even off the bus.  The airports and the
 
bus depots,  most of them,  have pretty much the same
 
architecture,  they look pretty much the same whether you' re
 
in St.  Louis or Mobile;  the books  in the bookstands will be
 
pretty much the  same  in Seattle and Miami;  the music over the
 
Muzak will be pretty much the same in Dallas and Denver.  If
 
you get a chance to go to a concert,  you'll probably hear
 
much the  same program -
-
 whether you hit a symphony orchestra
 
gala or a Michael Jackson big bash -
-
 they'll be the same in
 
Boston or Minneapolis.  And,  sadly enough,  that's happening
 
right around the whole world.  I could say the  same things
 
about Tokyo,  or Paris.  or Capetown.
 
Now,  if this continues,  as my brother Alan Lomax once
 
wrote  in an unforgettable phrasing -
-
 "If this condition of
 
worldwide cultural grey-out  continues,  pretty soon there will
 
no place  in the whole world worth visiting,  and no particular
 
reason to stay home either.  Think about that one  for a few
 
minutes.  How can we make vivid the fact that this  lovely
 
multi-colored world that we  see  in the astronauts'  photos
 
can,  unless we care  for it,  become uniformly dun-colored -
-
khaki,  desert-sandy,  mousy-brown.  Am I speaking of the
 
cultural environment or the physical environment?
 Really,
 
both.
 
And look,  you folks,  living here  in one of the most
 
historically fruitful  seed-beds  of music,  song,  story,  and
 
20
 
craft  in the whole nation,  how are you celebrating this?  I
 
expect,  except  in the most widely acceptable areas,  you' re
 
playing it down,  perhaps because  it  seems kind of country,  or
 
not up-to-date,  or out of a general sense that the act of
 
celebrating their Appalachian-ness will possibly hold your
 
students back from entering the brave new world of tomorrow
 
or getting a good job in Atlanta,  or mak±nq a ri

on the next  international  stock scam.
 
Let me bring to your attention an essay printed in this
 
month's Harpers by a professor of arts and humanities at the
 
University of Texas named Frederick Turner.  It's titled "The
 
Freedoms of the Past" and he begins with the  sentence "What
 
is today more boring than the up-to-date?" and he goes  on
 
later to point out  "the civilizations that have set
 
themselves to imitate the past have always been the most
 
creative and truly innovative ones.  The brilliance of
 
Japanese culture follows  from its devotion to classical
 
Chinese culture,  to the extent that one of its three scripts
 
(kanji)  and two of its three major religious traditions
 
(Buddhism and Confucianism)  were imported from China.  The
 
European Renaissance was  fired by the ambition to recapture
 
the art and thought  of ancient Greece and Rome;  pictorial
 
perspective was discovered by Brunelleschj in 1420 under the
 
mistaken belief that he merely was recovering a lost Roman
 
technique,  and opera was  invented in Florence by Pen ,
 
Caccini and Monteverdi  in an attempt to re-create the effects
 
of Greek tragedy.  .
.
 More recently one can cite the surge of
 
creativity that was released by the Romantic neomedievalists
 
of the nineteenth century,  and the conscious use of classical
 
European models by the writers of the American Renaissaince -
 
- Melville,  Hawthorne,  Thoreau,  Emerson,  and even Dickenson
 
and Whitman. .  .
 .Our cultural myth is one of liberation,  of the
 
present breaking the shackles of the past.  But what if it  is
 
the past that breaks the shackles of the present?
 Tradition,
 
Professor Turner says  firmly,  is the realm of true freedom.
 
18
 
Well,  poor Professor Turner.  I
' m botching up his
 
extremely cogent and yeasty essay when you really should give
 
it a separate read on your own;  it's  short but awfully fully
 
packed.  Let's get back to what we all can do about all this.
 
Suppose we  just accept  for right now all these arguments and
 
decide to try to support our local traditions,  what  can we do
 
about them?
 
Well,  the  first  thing  is to support your local artists.
 
Everybody in my home town knew who was the best quilt maker
 
in our area -
-
 it certainly wasn't me,  it was our quilt  lady.
 
Maybe they didn't call her an artist as my mother did,  but
 
they knew.  And they could have identified just as easily the
 
fellow who whittled the nicest chains or puzzle balls or the
 
one who knew all the words to The Golden Vanity.  Most of us
 
think such folks  just  do what they do because they do it and
 
they don't need any help,  but while  I was working at the
 
National Endowment  for the Arts  I got  a chance to look around
 
and see what artists'  problems were across the country,  and I
 
concluded finally that they were all in about the same
 
pickle.  The problems of traditional artists turned out to be
 
pretty much the  same as those of classical or popular or fine
 
artists.
 
All artists need to be heard or seen or experienced,
 
they all need their work to get out  into the world even  just
 
a little way,  to their own children or next door.  They all
 
need audiences,  whether large or small,  but they all greatly
 
benefit  from educated and sophisticated audiences -
-
 that  is,
 
audiences that understand the rudiments of the particular art
 
form and won't be expecting excitement where serenity is the
 
order of the art or blendy colors where visual contrast  is
 
the desideratum.
 
And there are some other simple needs that all artists,
 
folk and fine,  share.  They need to have their work included
 
in public school curricula so that all children can be
 
exposed to their own  special aesthetic principles.  They need
 
to have their property and personal rights protected from

exploitation,  they need to be able to make a little money at
 
their art  form from time to time.
 
Finally,  they need to be criticized;  they need to have
 
their work held to high standards,  so long as,  of course,  the
 
standards are the standards of that aesthetic system.  For
 
that,  you need a corps of aficionados,  people who have
 
steeped themselves  in the particular aesthetic system,  who
 
love  it and explain it and defend it.  Sometimes these experts
 
are members of the group whose arts they love;  sometimes the
 
truest deepest admirers come from outside.  Both however can
 
fairly be described as  scholars of the tradition.  I
 
understand you have several  such on your campus;  I hope they
 
are being enabled to work with students,  doing the kind of
 
investigations and presentations that bring dignity and
 
public recognition to the artists and the art  forms.
 
And from the perspective of a little girl who started
 
out  a long time ago loving string band music and lazy daisy
 
stitches  I can testify that caring for and putting in first
 
place the traditional root  cultural forms that we call the
 
folk arts,  has opened for me deep friendships and made mutual
 
alliances possible with people of all  sorts and backgrounds.
 
We tend to speak a very basic language together,  and whenever
 
I have the privilege of travelling to visit another local
 
group in another state,  I realize how strong many of these
 
local art  forms are,  how brilliant and engaging their
 
practitioners,  how ready they are for new audiences and new
 
ways to open up and enliven their particular part of the
 
world.
 
To help them with their purposes  is a wonderful work of
 
the hand and the spirit,  the better because  it will never be
 
finished.  Let us hope that the years to come will herald a
 
new coalition of energies working steadily and posit L
 
help our country delight  in its own artistry,  its owr
 
extraordinary history,  its own remarkably varied cult
d
 
past-present-future.  We probably don't know at this moment
 
exactly how to do all this,  but  remember what my mother
 
always  said -
-
 FaciendO ediscere  facere -
-
 by doing we  learn
 
to do.  So let us do,  and let us keep doing again,  and again.
 
What more  fruitful what more interesting task can we see
 
before us?
