The “Big Top” Show Goes On  
An Oral History of Occupations Inside and Outside the Canvas Circus Tent 
 
About Carol Rawls Mendez… 
 
Carol Rawls Mendez was born in Flint, Michigan, in 1952 and developed an interest in the 
circus at a very young age. As fate would have it, in 1971 she attended a circus when it was 
near her home town and met David Rawls, former owner of the Kelly Miller Circus. They 
were married in 1972 and she remained in the circus business for twenty-five years. After 
marrying, the first circus the Rawls worked on as a couple was the James M. Cole Circus 
and they trouped with this circus for several winters. In the summers they trouped with King 
Brothers Circus where she sold tickets for the sideshow and performed the blade box.  
 
Next she helped run the concessions on the Clyde Beatty Circus. After a year, she returned 
to the King Brothers Circus, which was managed by her father-in-law Harry Rawls.  
From there, she spent a season on Royal Brothers Circus, showing mostly in Canada. Then 
from there she went to Carson and Barnes Circus and trouped with them for six years. At 
that point, in 1983, David and she took out the Kelly Miller Circus. As a co-owner, Carol 
had multiple jobs from performance director to costume designer and maker to whatever 
needed to be done.  
 
Carol left the circus business in 1996 and continues to live in Hugo, Oklahoma. 
 
About Irene Kellogg… 
 
Irene Kellogg, mother of Carol Rawls Mendez, was born in Flint, Michigan in 1925. In 
1979, at the age of fifty-four, she joined the Carson and Barnes Circus for a season. During 
that season she worked the concession stand with Carol. At the end of the season she 
returned to Michigan, but she had gotten a taste of circus life. In 1986 she re-joined the 
circus. This time she was in charge of the cookhouse on the Kelly Miller Circus and held 
that position until she retired in 1988. During the winter months, she also assisted in the 
making of costumes.  
 
Irene has two daughters, Carol and Paula, and is a proud mother and grandmother. She now 
calls Hugo, Oklahoma home and continues to support the local circuses.

My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn and with me is Tanya Finchum. We’re 
with the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at the OSU Library. 
Today is Friday, August 12, 2011, and we’re in Hugo, Oklahoma, 
interviewing Carol Rawls Mendez and Irene Kellogg. Thank you for 
joining us today. 
 
Thank you. 
 
Well, let’s begin. I’m going to have each one of you tell where you were 
born, the year you were born, and maybe just give a little bit of 
background on your early life. We’ll begin with Irene. 
 
I was born in Flint, Michigan, March 16, 1925. I grew up there and 
didn’t join the circus until I was—what? Fifty-four years old. (Laughter) 
I had a beautiful childhood, enjoyed it, and married, had two daughters, 
Carol and Paula. 
 
Okay. That’s great. All right, Carol. 
 
I was born in Flint, Michigan, in 1952, September 9. Growing up I was 
always interested in circus. Matter of fact, my favorite toy, as I was a 
child, was a little clown. (Laughs) I can remember my mom saying, after 
I got in the business, “You always liked the circus!” (Laughs) 
 
How about the blouse I made you? 
 
Oh, yes. My favorite blouse had little clowns on it. I wanted to wear it 
every day when I was a kid. (Laughter) I met David Rawls in 1971 and 
we were married in ’72. Correct me if I’m wrong. (Laughs)

All right. 
 
I’m bad at dates. I met him on a circus. I went to see a circus in Lapeer, 
Michigan and met him and went up and bought a box of popcorn and 
fell in love. (Laughter) We were married about a year later, a year and a 
half later. I was in the business for twenty-five years. We were on—oh, 
goodness—our first circus was James M. Cole, indoor circus. It was a 
small traveling show in upstate New York, in Pennsylvania, in the 
wintertime. Mighty cold. We lived in travel trailers, moved every day, 
set up in high school gymnasiums. We trouped with him several winters, 
and in the summer we went on King Brothers Circus, whom his father, 
Harry Rawls, was the manager of. David and I did the sideshow. He was 
the sideshow boss, and I sold tickets for the sideshow. I also did what 
was called the blade box, which was a little performance inside, and they 
charged like ten cents to come see how I did it. It was just a box that 
they put swords through, and I kind of contorted around the swords as 
they were coming through. (Laughs) Then people would pay ten cents to 
see how it was done.  
 
Then we got an offer to go on Clyde Beatty Circus. My daughter was 
born the winter before we opened, and she was two weeks old when we 
opened with that circus. We were on Clyde Beatty for one year, ran the 
concessions, and then we went back to King Brothers Circus and…gosh! 
I’m trying to think. From there, we spent a season on Royal Brothers 
Circus, up in Canada, which was owned by Johnny Frazier, from Hugo 
here. That’s David’s uncle. Then from there we went to Carson and 
Barnes Circus, which is a local circus. We trouped with them for six 
years, and then we took out Kelly Miller Circus. We had Kelly Miller on 
the road from 1983 to—I don’t know what year they closed. I wasn’t 
with them anymore. 
 
’95? 
 
And here I am, still in Hugo. 
 
Well, I joined because my daughter was in it. 
 
Yes, she spent the year, … 
 
’79 with the Carson and Barnes, with you. We worked the concession 
stand. We had a ball! 
 
Yes. 
 
Loved it! I went back home, got my old job back, and I stayed there until

’86, but all I talked about was the circus. All my friends said, “Go back! 
Go back! You love it! You love it!” So I wanted to join in ’83, but Carol 
said, “No, you better wait awhile, yet.” 
 
I said, “Let’s make sure the show makes it and we had our footing.” 
(Laughs) 
 
So I joined back in ’86, and she said, “Mom, be the cook on the show.” I 
said, “Cook? I don’t think so!” (Laughter) She says, “I know you can do 
it. I know you can do it.” So I became the cook on the Kelly Miller show 
in ’86, and then I quit in ’88, because my aunt moved here from 
California and wouldn’t let me go again. (Laughter) 
 
Yes, we moved my aunt here. She was—what, eighty-nine when we 
moved her here? 
 
Quite, yes, about. 
 
She lived in Hollywood, California for sixty years or more. 
 
Yes. (Laughs) 
 
Yes, and she was just getting too old to live out there by herself. She 
didn’t have any friends left and I said, “You’re moving to Hugo!” So we 
moved her here. Matter of fact, she’s buried out in Showmen’s Rest… 
 
Showmen’s Rest. 
 
She really wasn’t a show person, but she was a character enough to be 
one. (Laughter) On the back of her tombstone I put “I would rather be in 
California,” because she used to say, “This is such a cow town, Hugo!” 
 
Well, she was used to stars and glamour. 
 
Yes. She said, “You can’t even get a taxicab here!” I said, “Honey, 
where would you go if you got one?” (Laughs) But she rode the elephant 
at our circus. She went to opening day every year, and she rode the 
elephant at what, ninety-five years old? 
 
Yes, and they put her picture in the paper. 
 
Wow. 
 
It was pretty cute. 
 
Well, what were your first impressions of Hugo?

David and I got married in Flint, Michigan, and we came down here 
right after the wedding. We came in on the west end of town there, and 
the first sign I saw was at this little, rinky-dink gas station that said, “If 
you can’t stop, honk and wave.” I looked at that and I said, “Honey, I 
will never live in this town.” (Laughter) Yes, it was kind of crazy, but 
about four years later, we bought a home here. (Laughs) 
 
You started out doing some stuff on the sideshow and working 
concessions. Did you do other things as well? 
 
Well, you did. 
 
No, not really. David and I also did a whip act in the sideshow where I 
held the burning papers and he put the fire out with the whip, which was 
interesting. David always told me, because his mother was a performer 
her whole life and raised the kids, that he didn’t want his wife to have to 
do that. So he really never let me perform, but I always wanted to. When 
my daughter was about five years old, it was our first year on Carson 
and Barnes Circus, she wanted to perform. There was this kid that had a 
unicycle act, Wally Eastwood, and his little sister was one of her friends 
and she was in the act, about a year younger, just styling it. So they said, 
“Sasha, you want to be in the act?” and she said, “Can I be in that act, 
Mommy?” I said, “I don’t care.” So she started performing then. She 
performed all the way through until she had her children, and then she 
took over the management end of Kelly Miller. 
 
But that first year that I went with the show she was only five or six, and 
every time we would park near a school, there were playgrounds. She 
wanted to go and play on the playgrounds. I took my camera with me 
one time, and she’s doing all these tricks. She’s hanging by her heels and 
oh, just scaring me! I said, “Oh, Grandma just ran out of film.” And she 
said, “Take some pictures with your eyes,” and I’ll never forget that. 
That was so sweet. 
 
Yes, she started the following year. They decided to put Barbara Byrd’s, 
who is the owner of Carson and Barnes Circus now, two daughters into 
the production number, which is the act where there will be a center ring 
trapeze act or something, and then they’ll have like sixteen girls around 
doing either web or swinging ladder or something. So they decided to 
put the three girls, my daughter and her two daughters, in doing the 
ladder, I guess it was. Lisa Fulton was training them, and she would 
come home every day and her little wrists would be bloody, because you 
have to hang on to a loop and slide the thing up so it doesn’t slip off, and 
her little ankle, the same thing. I said, “Sasha, you don’t have to do this, 
honey.” “Oh, I want to, Mommy. I want to.”

Dedicated. 
 
Yes, she was quite a trouper. When she was on Kelly Miller about nine, 
ten years old, she was getting ready to go in. She had a horse, and she 
did a liberty or a horse act. They were out in the rodeo arena riding the 
horses around before they took them to the back door. Her horse took off 
running straight for a fence and wound up stopping right before it got to 
the fence. She flew over it and hit the fence, cut her lip, horribly, but by 
golly, she went on! I said, “You don’t have to go in, honey.” She looked 
horrible. Her poor little lip was just so swelled up. She did two other acts 
after that and finished the show out. She was quite a trouper. 
 
The show must go on. 
 
Yes, yes. You need to interview Sasha. (Laughs) 
 
Well, when you’re working in the cookhouse, Irene, do you know what 
you’re going to cook every day? Is it pre-set? 
 
Oh, yes. Carol and I, we would go shopping for the food. She’d have a 
basket, I’d have a basket, and it’d be just loaded with food. People 
would look at us. (Laughs) But we planned meals and wrote out 
everything we needed. I kept a cookbook of what meals we planned, 
how much you had to buy for it, because we had how many people, 
sixty-five at that time? We would flip through that cookbook every now 
and then to get an idea of what we wanted to make. Keeping records was 
such a good idea. “We haven’t had this for a while. We’ll have that. That 
went over great.” Then she knew exactly how much to get for the meals. 
I had a little slate and I’d write the menu on it. Even Kelly, he started 
writing the menu for the people when I would hang it out there. We even 
made elephant stew one time. (Laughter) That’s a joke. 
 
Not with real elephant. (Laughter) 
 
I was going to say, “What was the meat in that stew?” (Laughter) 
 
But that fed a lot of people. 
 
I guess you were looking for recipes that would be easy to feed lots of 
people? 
 
Yes, and economical. But at that time, we had circus fans that used to 
come to the circus all the time. 
 
They would bring a lot of vegetables and fruit and things like that for us.

But what I was going to say was that, remember the time that Frank Ball 
from the Washington, D.C. area came out and we were having crab salad 
that day… 
 
Oh, yes. 
 
…and he said, “Oh, man!” (Laughter) It was imitation crab, but in the 
summer … 
 
It went over great. 
 
…when it’s hot… 
 
It was great. 
 
…nobody feels like eating spaghetti or something like that. We used to 
do a lot of salads and stuff. He just thought that was so great that we 
were having crab salad. He said, “What circus serves crab salad?” 
(Laughter) 
 
What were your living quarters like when you joined? 
 
Well, with the Carson and Barnes, that first year, they gave me a truck 
and a camper. That’s when we picked up our little dogs, Munchy and… 
 
Peanut. 
 
Peanut. (Laughs) Kept those little dogs for eighteen years. 
 
Yes, and then when she came on Kelly Miller, she had a travel trailer. 
 
I bought my own truck and a trailer. 
 
Did you drive it or did you have someone else…? 
 
No, I drove it myself. 
 
She drove it. She drove it, yes. 
 
And how many arrows did you blow? (Laughter) 
 
I tried to train that dog to bark every time he saw an arrow, but he never 
got that. (Laughter) But I did blow the arrows a few times, and I ended 
up in a subdivision.

A residential area. (Laughter) 
 
Boy that guy, when I turned around in his driveway, he was so glad to 
see me go. (Laughter) I tore up his lawn with the trailer, and I stopped 
and offered to pay for it, and he said, “No, no. Just go.” 
 
“Just go. Just get out of here!” (Laughter) We used to have CB [citizens 
band] radios and I called her. I’m like, “Mom, where are you? I lost 
you!” because she used to follow me. 
 
Oh, gosh. 
 
“I don’t know where I am!” (Laughs) 
 
She said, “Where were you?” I said, “I don’t want to talk about it.” 
(Laughter) 
 
Well, Carol, was it hard raising kids on the road? 
 
No, no. People, now that I’m not in the business anymore, they’re like, 
“Oh, I bet you’re glad not to be…” and it’s like, “Glad, are you kidding? 
I’d go back on a circus in a heartbeat!”  
 
Yes, I miss the good times. 
 
To me, there’s no better way to raise children than on the circus. Even 
my daughter, she says, “My kids are getting kind of countrified here, 
Mom, since we’ve been home.” 
 
Well, they get a good education about different towns, different people. 
 
Yes, when my daughter was in school—Barbara Byrd and I, when we 
were on Carson and Barnes our kids were like the same age so we 
buddied up quite a bit. We used to, if we were close to something in the 
morning… 
 
Yes, Grand Canyon or any place… 
 
…we would jump in the car and take off. She had a van. The one 
season—I can’t remember what year it was, but we visited like seven 
national parks. (Laughs) It was like, “We’re close, let’s go!” We used to 
call it Barbara’s Gold Star Tours because we’d be like, the minute we’d 
leave the lot we’d look at our watch to see how long it takes us to get 
there so we knew what time we had to leave to be back in time for show 
time. So it was like these whirlwind trips. The time we went to Grand 
Canyon was hysterical, because we got there and we were like, “Oh, my

goodness! It took us way longer to get here. Okay girls, we’ve got 
fifteen minutes.” We’re snapping pictures like crazy and then it’s like, 
“Got to go! Let’s go!” (Laughs) 
 
Oh, and Niagara Falls. You were near there. 
 
Oh, yes. I mean, we… 
 
And museums. Oh, wonderful museums! 
 
Well, I started saying when Sasha was in school and Sasha, when 
they’re studying United States, “Oh, I’ve been there. I’ve been there. 
I’ve been there.” And their teacher, I went to a parent/teacher meeting 
and she said, “Every place we talk about, Sasha says she has been there. 
Is that true?” and I said, “Probably.” (Laughter) So I used to collect a 
pamphlet or I’d pick up a tour book or something of all the places that 
we were, and I had them in a box up in the attic. So I went up and got 
that box, took it to the teacher, and I said, “Here’s where Sasha has 
been.” She kept the box for about a week, and she said, “Oh, my 
goodness!” It’s true. I mean, by the time Sasha was nine years old, she 
was in forty-eight states, all forty-eight states she had seen. It’s not like 
the average person traveling the country. I mean, that’s what’s so nice 
about circus business. You don’t go to just New York City, get on a 
plane and go there. You stop at… 
 
There are several towns, yes. 
 
…every little town along the way to get there, and you see the whole 
country. It’s so neat when you meet someone and they’re like, “Oh, 
well, I’m from a little town in Pennsylvania,” or something, “Where?” 
They say, “Oh, so and so town.” You say, “Oh, yes. There’s a great 
restaurant there!” and they look at you like, “What? You’ve been there?” 
“Yes!” (Laughter) Yes, the traveling part of it and raising your kids, 
they’re so much more worldly wise and can communicate with adults. 
My daughter was six years old before she was on a circus with other 
kids. She didn’t know how to play with kids. We went on Carson and 
Barnes and there was—well, Lucy Loyal’s kids were all her age and 
Barbara’s kids, and they just had this big clique. There was a whole 
clique of girls about seven, eight of them. She just loved it. 
 
Where were the boys? (Laughter) Were there very many boys, really, at 
that age, too, or mostly girls? 
 
There were a few, but it was mostly girls, yes. It was kind of neat, 
because they had a whole little clique, and they would take off and go 
adventure every day. (Laughs)

Then when winter came and we were home, we made costumes. 
 
Yes, I did all the costumes for Kelly Miller. 
 
We’d sit up until two, three, four o’clock in the morning sewing sequins 
and beads on these costumes. 
 
Where would you get your supplies to do that, fabric and such? 
 
Order it out of Florida. There was a good place down in Sarasota meant 
for show people. 
 
You would draw sketches of different costumes, “Oh, that’s great! 
That’s great! That’s a good one.”  
 
Without having had a design class… 
 
Yes, yes. When that show Project Runway came on I was like, “Oh, I 
could do that,” but now after watching it, it’s like, “No. I’m not that 
good.” (Laughs) Yes, I used to take patterns and switch them up. I’d buy 
swimsuit patterns just to get the basic and then redesign the whole 
pattern, add stuff or take away or… 
 
For the whole troupe or just for one or two performers. 
 
For any of the show acts, which would be like the production number, 
usually the horse act, because the horses were owned by the show and 
you’d just have someone ride them, and the elephant act. 
 
The elephants, you made those headpieces and… 
 
…and the blankets. 
 
Yes. 
 
Yes, the elephant blankets. 
 
Oh, and the same for the camels. 
 
The camels and llamas, yes. I made the blankets for the camels and the 
llamas. 
 
I had a llama spit on me one time. (Laughter) Shouldn’t have been there. 
 
So in the winter you probably stay pretty busy with all the sewing…

By January… 
 
…and planning for the next season. 
 
By January first, I would have all my fabric and just go hot and heavy 
until opening, yes. One time I was called for jury duty about two weeks 
before the show, and I was running a little behind. I said to the judge, 
“Please, I’ll come any time after the show opens. Please, don’t…” and 
she said, “Now, do you really think that’s a good excuse?” And so she 
put me on jury duty, but while we were in deliberating or taking our 
breaks, I’m sitting there sewing sequins. (Laughter)  
 
I wonder if they should talk to Allen. 
 
Yes, Allen Jones, he would be an interesting… 
 
He was the office manager of the… 
 
Kelly Miller for years, and he was my buddy that would help me sew. 
 
And he would help us sew these, yes. He was good. 
 
He was in theater before he joined the circus. 
 
Well, he still is. 
 
Yes, he’s now the manager of the Paris Little Theater in Paris, Texas. 
 
Where would you do most of the sewing? 
 
At my house. I had a big room in the upstairs. It was like an old—I don’t 
know what they’d call it. 
 
Well, the house is across the street [from the Library in Hugo]. 
 
Across the street there, yes, yes. It was a great big room. 
 
The back upstairs. 
 
There were twelve windows in that room.

A lot of light. 
 
It was my little window on the world back there, because I’d sit up there 
from morning ‘til wee hours in the morning, sewing. 
 
That was before all these fancy programmed sewing machines, too, to do 
the fancy stitches. 
 
Oh, yes. 
 
Yes, well, most of it was sewing sequins and putting rhinestones on 
and… 
 
Well, once you got the costume made… 
 
Yes. 
 
But that’s mostly straight sewing, anyway. 
 
Praying my little sewing machine would make it through elephant 
blankets of like four layers and a big strap all the way around it to hold it 
on. (Laughs) “C’mon baby, you can do it! You can do it!” I still have 
that sewing machine and still sew on it. 
 
Really? 
 
Yes. 
 
Oh. 
 
And you would do new ones every year? Even the elephant… 
 
No, usually—well, the costumes, sometimes one year. Sometimes you 
could get two years out of them or you’d just kind of re-vamp them. 
 
They don’t do that so much anymore. 
 
No. 
 
They do their own, today. 
 
Yes, most performers. Barbara still does a lot of production. 
 
Does she? 
 
Did you do the head things, too?

Oh, yes, the headpieces. See, now, Allen, he was my headpiece man. He 
loved doing the headpieces. I’d be like, “Okay, Allen, you do that and 
I’ll do this.” 
 
Were you able to give input into the overall feel of the show, in terms of 
maybe the order of acts? 
 
Yes, on Kelly Miller, I had a lot of input on that. I was like the 
performance director so I would tell people, “No, you can’t do that.” 
(Laughs) 
 
Yes, you switch the performances around to make a nice show, even 
flowing show. 
 
Yes, and the prop changes and all that stuff. 
 
Choose the music, too? 
 
Yes, a lot of times a lot of acts have their own music that they work to, 
but if it was allowed. We did belong to ASCAP [American Society of 
Composers, Authors, and Publishers] for years so paid the royalties on 
the songs.  
 
Did you ever have to put up the tent, sling that forty pound hammer? 
 
Oh, yeah. Not necessarily that, but I’ve hung a lot of sidewall and 
carried seat boards, and in the wind, help them guy out when the storm 
was coming or sew the tent back together when it got torn to pieces. 
 
That was scary times, when the weather was bad. 
 
Yes. 
 
Or you’re stuck in the mud. 
 
Yes. 
 
An elephant has to pull your truck out, and that first season it rained for 
a month straight. 
 
Thirty-six days straight… 
 
Yes. 
 
…we had rain the first year she was on the show.

In ’79. Oh, my gosh! 
 
Yes, from opening day on for thirty-six days, we were pulled on and 
pulled off of every lot. 
 
And Barbara every day would say, “I’m so sorry, Irene. This is your first 
year and the weather is…” 
 
“It’s normally not like this!” 
 
I said, “Barbara, it’s not your fault.” 
 
Yes, that rain was just falling. 
 
And you told me to get boots for sure, and I’m glad I had them, big, high 
boots. I remember one time falling down, getting my electrical cord in 
the mud. (Laughter) But you laugh about it today. 
 
Oh, yes, lots of good stories. 
 
You mentioned boots, what are other must-haves on the road? 
 
Boots. (Laughter) 
 
Boots and more boots, huh? 
 
A raincoat, yes. 
 
Raincoats, yes. 
 
Gosh! Must-haves…I don’t know. A good attitude, I guess. (Laughs) 
 
I think that’s the most—and patience. 
 
Patience, yes. You either like it or you hate it. There’s no in between. 
 
There’s no medium. 
 
No. 
 
No. 
 
I’ve noticed that. I mean, I’ve seen people join the circus and six months 
later or six weeks later, they’re “I can’t do this.”

They’re gone in a month. They can’t… 
 
Or a week. (Laughs) 
 
Yes, or a week. 
 
And then other guys, that were just people that join the show, come into 
town and join the show, and they’d be with us for years. It’s just you 
either like it or you hate it. There’s absolutely no in between. 
 
It’s a lot of work. It’s a lot more work than we thought. 
 
Oh, yes. 
 
We are learning it’s a lot of work. 
 
Yes, but to me it was easy. I mean, you get up at five o’clock in the 
morning. I’d always throw a little makeup on, jump in the truck, drag the 
kids to the car. They were probably asleep. 
 
In their jammies. (Laughs) 
 
Yes. And drive to the next town. That was your thinking time. I loved 
the drive in the morning or the drive at night. Some shows move… 
 
Get a route slip. 
 
It’s just—I don’t know—your time to contemplate what life is all about. 
Watching the sun come up in the morning or… 
 
When Sasha would ride with me she’d say, “Grandma, put in the tape 
‘On the Road Again.’” (Laughter) So we’d sit there singing “On the 
Road Again.” 
 
Yes, there’s just… 
 
A lot of happy times. 
 
Yes, more happy times than bad times.

And people would say, like with my kids in school and everything, 
they’d be like, “Oh, I bet you’re glad to be home,” because I used to 
come home in the fall when school started. We used to be able to take 
them out early in the spring after the SRA test, and then we’d take the 
kids out and go on the road and communicate and finish up the year 
through the teachers, sending their paperwork back and forth and stuff. 
In the fall we always tried to get here by the time school started or just 
within a week. They would say, “Oh, I bet you’re glad you’re home.” 
It’s like, “Are you kidding me?” Life is so routine on the circus. Every 
day is the same, but it’s different. It’s hard to explain. 
 
Well, it’s a different town and… 
 
You have different challenges every day… 
 
…different roads and everything. 
 
…and different problems. One truck would break down and you’re 
running late, and you’ve got to figure out… 
 
I kept a diary in writing. I would try to remember different names and 
things for my diary, and I would be scribbling it and drive. (Laughter) 
 
I’m like, “Mom, quit writing in your diary and drive!” (Laughter) I’d 
always know when she was writing, because she’d slow down. I’d see 
her get farther and farther away from me in the rearview mirror. 
(Laughs) 
 
Pre-texting. 
 
Yes, now. 
 
Yes. 
 
It’d be easier, now. 
 
Well, did you learn any special tricks on the road, like you ever learn 
how to change out your engine or is there anything that…? 
 
No, but I changed many a flat on the side of the road, and I’m not afraid 
to do that even now. My daughter, she is now, they own Main Tire over 
there and she’s a lot like me. She likes to wear nice clothes and fancy 
jewelry and stuff, but by golly, she’ll get out there and roll tires or go 
check an engine and say, “Nope, you’ve got this wrong with it.” 
(Laughs) People look at her like, “My goodness!”

about getting dirty. It’s like, “Oh, c’mon.” (Laughs) “You have no idea 
what dirty is.” 
 
I guess mud is probably one of your bigger problems on the road. 
 
One time I had to have two elephants to pull me out. 
 
Yes, yes. 
 
God! The elephant came over and looked at me as I was sitting in the 
cab and I said, “I didn’t do it!” (Laughter) But they hooked it. In fact, I 
still have my chain on the truck. I gave my truck to my grandson. I 
finally did. 
 
She kept that truck for a long time. 
 
Yes. I tell you, I sat there and cried when I said, “I’m going to give you 
away.” (Laughter) 
 
And what’s the grandson’s name? 
 
Drake, that’s Sasha’s husband. 
 
Sasha’s husband, yes. 
 
Yes, her little boy, Hunter, he’s seven, seven and a half, almost eight. He 
calls it the Gray Ghost. (Laughter) He loves that truck. Yes, I only had 
47,000 miles, did it all on the road. I didn’t do it here, in Hugo. 
 
And the truck was what year?

Three, three seasons, yes. 
 
People think, “Oh, you travel a lot of miles.” Well, the circus, I mean, 
we go ten, fifteen thousand miles a year. That’s it and it’s not bad. You 
do fifty miles a day. Sometimes you’d have a two hundred mile jump or 
a long one. 
 
Oh, yes. You’d look at that route slip and say, “Whew! That’s a long 
one.” 
 
Yes. We used to show Maryland every year for the state police. We had 
several sell-out dates up there that were two and three-day stands, 
which… 
 
How about the Ann Arbor? 
 
… we couldn’t wait to get to those states. That was like in June. Then 
we’d jump out of there and jump all the way across Pennsylvania to 
Ohio, and that was a big, miserable day. I remember one time we were 
going across the Pennsylvania Turnpike there, and this truck cut off our 
horse trailer truck—we had about an eight horse trailer—and messed up 
the wheel on it and everything. Well, I’m coming along and I pull over. 
This guy’s sitting there with this big semi-truck and it was dripping. It 
smells horrible! We’re waiting on the police to get there, and finally I 
said to the guy, “What are you hauling in that truck?” and he said, “You 
don’t want to know, ma’am.” I said, “No, I do.” And he said, “New 
York City garbage.”  
 
Oh, wow. 
 
Yes, and they were taking it to West Virginia. It was like, “Oh!” It was a 
semi-truck full of New York City garbage, yes. He made that run every 
day, across there. 
 
Well, do you have a favorite city or venue you’ve played in through the 
years? 
 
Well, a lot of people would say, “Where were you yesterday?” “I don’t 
know.” (Laughter)  
 
“Where are you going tomorrow?” “I don’t know.” (Laughs) 
 
You forget it so quick, it’s amazing.

Favorite places, yes, Michigan, and not just because we’re from there. 
Michigan is a beautiful state. Like in the mornings, we used to play all 
up the west coast of Michigan, Lake Michigan area there, and all the 
little resort towns in the summer. We hit Michigan almost every summer 
with Kelly Miller. Either Michigan or we’d go into to Canada. 
 
Loved the beaches. 
 
Ontario, yes. And it’s like, “Okay. We’re going to be on the lot. I’ll go 
to the grocery store, get the shopping done and we can be at the beach 
by eleven o’clock.” (Laughs) Stay at the beach until show time. 
 
The first show is what, two o’clock? 
 
Yes. 
 
Five o’clock. 
 
But you had to be back an hour before show time to get ready. 
 
Remember when it snowed in Colorado? 
 
Oh, yes. 
 
On Mother’s Day? (Laughs) 
 
Yes. 
 
We were there and they wouldn’t take the elephants out of the truck, 
because it was too cold for them. Then we had to change lots, too, that 
time. 
 
Yes. 
 
You still performed though, even though it was snowing? 
 
Yes, luckily that was like a three-day stand, I think, and we changed lots 
and set up the tent. Mr. Miller, he went and rented some of those big gas 
blowers and put them in the cookhouse for the working guys and stuff 
because the sleeper trucks, you travel usually in the warm weather and 
you don’t have heat and stuff in them. Usually, a little electric heater if 
you get a cool evening or something will keep it warm enough. But yes, 
he went and rented the big—plus, the tent had snow on it so he put them 
in the big top to melt the snow off the top of the tent so it wouldn’t

collapse. 
 
A lot of problems to work. 
 
Yes. 
 
Problems to figure out, I guess. 
 
Yes, yes. It’s a challenge, but it’s a fun challenge. 
 
After the show is over, a lot of times we’d have cookouts at different 
trailers and it was fun. 
 
Sunday nights and stuff, yes. 
 
Yes, it was fun. Or we’d go to a show in town. 
 
Movie, yes, Sunday night you usually were done by six, seven o’clock. 
So it was your few hours to get out and go away. 
 
Go to dinner at one of the restaurants and go to a show. 
 
A movie or something, yes. 
 
Be a towner for an afternoon. 
 
Yes. 
 
Yes. 
 
Well, how would you do your laundry? 
 
Laundromats. 
 
At the Laundromats. 
 
Until later, then the trailers, they put washers and dryers in them now. 
 
Yes, but the earlier times they didn’t have them. 
 
My last two trailers I had had washers and dryers in them, which was so 
wonderful, because that was one of the biggest thing I hated about the 
circus. That was probably the only thing I hated about the circus was 
going to the Laundromats.

Yes, I got back to my trailer and I said, “Where’s this? Where’s that? 
[Gasps] I didn’t pull that other dryer out!” I’d run back to the 
Laundromat, because we’d be leaving in the morning. (Laughs) 
 
In the cookhouse, did you have a dishwasher? 
 
No, no. 
 
A person that washed dishes. 
 
Yes. 
 
Yes, she had… 
 
I had one helper. 
 
…a helper that washed dishes and helped prepare the meals. But it’s 
like, well… 
 
We had a big freezer chest. If there were sales… 
 
Sales on meat, I’d stock up on something and we’d bury it down in the 
freezer so we’d have it. Yes, we served coffee and donuts in the morning 
before we moved to the next town. 
 
About four thirty, five o’clock. 
 
Five o’clock, yes, and everybody would go to the cookhouse and have 
coffee and donuts. Then, when you’d get to the next town we’d serve 
lunch at like, from eleven-thirty to twelve-thirty, which was right after 
the tent was up. Everybody was done working, and they’d come eat 
lunch. Then, usually, go to sleep for a couple hours. That’s naptime on 
the show, usually from about one ‘til three, everybody. The lot is quiet! 
(Laughs) Then about three o’clock, everybody wakes up and things start 
moving and getting ready for show time. 
 
Then dinnertime, everybody came when they could, between their acts.

have some more?” I said, “You know, we got a lot of them! Here, just 
take a little bit.” (Laughter) They’d want two or three helpings when it 
was special for them. 
 
Yes, and then she’d serve the lunch, which usually was—sometimes 
we’d do a breakfast-lunch like French toast and bacon or something. 
Sometimes we’d do sandwiches and soup or if we had a lot of leftover 
from the day before, like say… 
 
Sausage and cream over… 
 
Gravy, yes. 
 
…gravy over biscuits and things. 
 
Say, for instance, we had goulash or something the night before and we 
had a bunch of it left over. We’d serve like, sandwiches and goulash for 
lunch. Then, like, the dinner would always be a full-fledged big dinner. 
 
Yes, roast a lot of chickens, even. 
 
Yes, chicken or… 
 
And biscuits from scratch? 
 
No, box. Yes, like Jiffy Mix or something or Bisquick.

Oh, quicker, yes. 
 
Now, Hazel Frazier was the cook on Carson and Barnes, and that was 
one of her specialties. She was the biscuit lady! (Laughter) She used to 
make the best biscuits, and she used to make them from scratch. Of 
course, she had a big crew that helped her and a much bigger cookhouse. 
Kelly Miller’s was not a really—it was…

It was fun when we had Halloween on the show and everybody came in 
costume. 
 
Yes, we used to always have a big Halloween party. 
 
Oh, it’s fun. I played Aunt Jemima, blackened my face and made pillows 
and scarf around my head. (Laughter)

costume.

moving, but everybody cared for each other. It’s not…

somebody was going to stop and help.

Because we all followed each other.

They tail up. 
 
They were the last to leave the lot. 
 
Yes, they’d stop for anybody that was broke down and do their best to 
get them in. If you can’t, you call a wrecker, yes. That first year on Kelly 
Miller, there was a clown named Zippo. He was our welder, our clown, 
and our mechanic. I followed the fleet. David would go ahead of the 
show and make sure the lot was laid out right and get everything parked, 
and I followed the fleet with Zippo. Well, that first year we had a bus, an 
old school bus, that was our sleeper, big top sleeper, and the back end of 
it was our cookhouse. That thing broke down more times! (Laughs) And 
Zippo, I’d pull up, and it was like, “Oh, no! Now what’s wrong?” I had 
this little box of goodies in my trailer, little pieces of screws and springs 
and bolts and nuts, just all kinds of stuff, and Zippo would say, “God, if 
I only had…” “Wait, I think I’ve got one!” and I’d run and get that. We 
called it our little magic box. But many a time I’ve dug through there 
and it’s like, “Is this what you need, Zippo?” And he’d be like, “Bless 
you!” (Laughs) 
 
“That’ll work!” 
 
Fix it and we’d get that truck on to the next town. Yes, a lot of good 
memories, a lot of good memories. 
 
You have to have a lot of talent, too, and skills, various types of skills. 
 
A little bit of everything. 
 
Yes, well, you learn. Being on the road all those years, I’m not afraid to 
tackle anything. I got to be the water pump lady. I could tear a water 
pump apart on a trailer and put it back together, and I had a whole box of 
parts. Somebody would say, “My water pump is broke down.” “Why? 
How’s it acting?” or, “What’s it doing?” I’d go tear it apart and rip a part 
out of another old one I had, and put it on. “Thank you, Carol!” Because 
when you’re on the road, it’s hard to get into a trailer place, a trailer 
repair place. You just learn to do all that little stuff yourself, plugs. 
 
I guess water is very important, too. 
 
Oh, yes. 
 
Water is a tricky situation on a circus. 
 
Oh, a lot of different towns, the water we didn’t like.

Yes. Well, on Carson and Barnes… 
 
We would have a water boy that would come around and fill our tanks in 
our trailers every day. 
 
Yes, you would just… 
 
A water boy. 
 
Somebody would be the water man. 
 
Yes. 
 
Kind of ration it out or could you have as much as you want? 
 
No. 
 
You could fill it. 
 
Yes, fill your tank on the trailer, and you’d try to make that water last. 
 
Sure. 
 
Circus people are very green, because we had a family of four that was 
living on what, fifty gallons of water a day? That’s pretty good, right? 
 
Yes. 
 
All taking baths… of course, in a trailer they’ve got the little button on 
the shower. You turn it on, wet up, turn it off, shampoo, soap up, and 
then rinse off. Yes, when the kids are little and learning to take their first 
baths it’s like, “Turn that water off! You’re going to run us out.” 
(Laughs) Yes, and I used to do a load of laundry every day, but I’d try to 
get it before the water man got there. I was using up the last of the tank 
from the day before. 
 
Yes, that’s when you got your washer. 
 
“Oh, man! Here comes the water man. Oh, good! It’s on the rinse cycle. 
It’s almost done.” 
 
So you do little tricks. 
 
Start your day with… 
 
Yes, there are a lot of little jobs that everybody has their own job.

Yes, and then the water man, everybody would tip him, like five, ten 
bucks a week. So it was extra money. One of the working guys would 
always want the water man job, because it meant a little extra tip for 
him. He could make an extra 100 bucks a week or something. Yes, on 
Carson and Barnes, they had a water truck, which actually was a big 
tank that they would go and fill up from a fire hydrant and then drive the 
truck around the lot and water all the trailers. But on Kelly Miller, when 
we took Kelly Miller out, they said, “Well, you’ve got to have a water 
truck.” “We’re only going to play lots that have water.” So it worked out 
fine. Our water truck was a long hose, and it didn’t take gas to get it over 
the road. (Laughter) It saved a lot of money. 
 
It worked out, though. 
 
Yes, and the poor water man who was attaching sometimes, he’d have 
ten, fifteen hoses to take out there, but in the long run it was much 
cheaper than having a truck that had to drive around. 
 
Well, both of you went from town life to circus life. What are some of the 
unique terms that you had to learn? 
 
A straw house. 
 
First of May. 
 
First of May. 
 
Yes. 
 
That’s the fellows that join the show and leave. We call them the First of 
May. 
 
No, first year on the circus you’re the First of May. Circuses used to 
open in May and that’s how it got started. 
 
Oh, I see. Right. 
 
And it’s like, “Yes, they’re a First of May,” it’s like their first year on 
the circus. 
 
What’s a straw house? 
 
A full house. 
 
Oh, okay.

Yes, when the tent’s jam-packed, that’s a straw house. 
 
We’ve had where they’ve had to put up the side walls to have people 
standing. 
 
Yes, standing room only. 
 
Gee! 
 
You’d say, “We’re full. This is the last show we’re doing. If you want, 
all we’ve got is standing room if you’re willing to do that.” 
 
They’ve even had an extra show… 
 
Oh, yes. 
 
…when we didn’t plan it. 
 
Those were good days, then. 
 
Yes, if there’s twenty people left on the midway and you’ve got the tent 
full, it’s like you don’t want to do another show for twenty people. 
 
No, no. 
 
If you’ve got 200 people standing out there, then you say, “Okay. We’ll 
do another show.” (Laughs) Yes, I don’t know on terms, I thought—oh. 
There’s a thing they always—it used to kind of be an old circus thing, I 
guess. They’d always pull it on people, First of Mays, on the circus. My 
father-in-law—we’re on King Brothers Circus, out there—he says, 
“Carol, go to the office and get the midway key.” (Laughter) “Okay.” I 
didn’t know what a midway key was. There is no midway key! So you 
go to the office and, “Mrs. So and So,” I can’t remember her name, 
“Harry just sent me up here for the midway key,” and she just starts 
cracking up. (Laughs) Then another one is a sky hook, “Go get the sky 
hook.” (Laughs) I was like, “What the heck is a sky hook?” No such 
thing, but yes, little jokes they play on First of Mays on the circus. Yes, 
there’s—well, like making the nut for the day. 
 
Yes. 
 
You’ve heard that and where that started. I can’t think of any. There are 
a lot of them, but… 
 
There are a lot of them but I can’t think of any.

Flag’s up, that means time for cookhouse. You used to have a little flag 
that you’d put up, and everybody would always look over at the truck to 
see if the flag was up.  
 
I should’ve read through my diary. (Laughter) 
 
When you go from the first show of the season to the very last show of 
the season, is there much difference between the two? 
 
Oh, yes. Oh, yes. You get in the dog days of summer when everybody 
starts dragging and it’s like, “Oh, man!” Then you start counting the 
days down. 
 
Down, yes. 
 
Then, like that last month, “Woo-hoo! We’ve only got thirty-two days 
and we’ll be home!” (Laughs) Yes, but it’s kind of funny, because you 
get home and you enjoy it for about six weeks, and then it’s like, “I’m 
ready. Let’s get out of here. Let’s go back on the road. I can’t wait until 
opening.” It’s like the excitement of opening. It’s just, ooh, nothing like 
it, nothing like it. 
 
Do you still go when one of them opens here? 
 
Oh, absolutely. Yes, every show, go to their opening. 
 
Do you sit in the stands or do you watch from behind the scenes? 
 
No, I usually… 
 
Sit in the stands. 
 
…sit in the stands, yes, appreciate the show, enjoy it. 
 
And what’s your favorite part of the show? 
 
I like aerial acts. I always did. 
 
Not clowns? 
 
No. (Laughter) After I got to know a few clowns I didn’t like them 
anymore. (Laughter) No, I shouldn’t say that. I had a lot of good friends 
that were clowns. Popcorn is one. He’s a fun person, a lot of fun. 
 
Well, do you remember the first time you met D.R. Miller?

Mendez

Oh, yes. 
 
What did you think of D.R.? 
 
Admired him. 
 
Yes. 
 
And he was a storyteller. Talk about telling stories. Man, you could sit 
and listen to him all day long, tell stories. Matter of fact, after I’d got off 
the road and David and I got a divorce and that following summer, D.R. 
was home. His wife was ill and so I used to go out and visit him. He’d 
sit in the office out there. He’d just sit and tell me stories, and I just 
loved it, just listening to him talk. Cutting up jackpots, they’d call it.  
 
I made a cherry cheesecake. I’d come on the lot and he would spot me 
on the midway. He’d say, “If you don’t make me a cherry cheesecake 
tonight I’m going to put you in the mud!” (Laughter) He’d tease me. He 
was a great old guy. 
 
And talk about directing trucks on a circus. I mean, like, to back you up. 
He would spot you and be like, “This way, this way,” you’d be turning 
the wheel. If you looked in your rearview mirrors he’d be like, “No, 
watch me!” and he was always chewing tobacco. He’d spit, “Watch me, 
I said! Watch me!” This one time we played this lot, I think it was 
around Chicago. It was so small. I pulled up and it’s like wall to wall 
trucks on this lot. You couldn’t see a space anywhere. “C’mon Carol,” 
and he’s a chewing away. I’d follow him and he’s like, “Okay, back it 
up.” I look in the rearview mirror and it’s like, “Back it up where? 
There’s nowhere to go!” I mean, he finagled me into this spot that was 
just like a postage stamp. My whole travel trailer and truck, everything, I 
backed between these two trucks in, around, and he’s just doing this. 
(Gestures) (Laughs) 
 
Yes, and you had to watch him. 
 
He’s like, “Watch me! Watch me!” (Laughs) When we got done he said, 
“Very good, Carol.” (Laughter) But he was an amazing man. He knew 
everything about the business, inside and out. His wife Isla was… 
 
She was a wonderful doll. 
 
…the sweetest person you’d ever want to meet. 
 
Beautiful person.

Yes, yes. Those are two people in show business that are a big loss to

Oh, yes. 
 
Two fantastic people. 
 
Well, you could live anywhere. You’ve seen the country, yet you make 
your home here in Hugo. Why do you decide to stay here in Hugo? 
 
I stay here because my kids and grandkids are here. 
 
That’s why I’m here.  
 
Yes, yes. 
 
My grandchildren and great-grandchildren are here. 
 
Yes, I don’t know. Hugo’s a nice little town, though. And shoot, all the 
circuses are here. You know what you’re doing in the spring, anyway. 
(Laughs) 
 
No, we usually like the weather here. That’s why the circus is here, 
because of the weather. 
 
Yes, this is an unusually hot summer. Yes, as a matter of fact, about a 
month ago I was looking on the internet at houses in Michigan, and I 
said, “Mom, let’s go in and by a little place up in Michigan and go out 
there in the summer.” (Laughs) 
 
Well, see, her father passed away in 1969, and I bet he turned over in his 
grave when I joined the show. (Laughs) 
 
Yes. 
 
What had you done before you joined? 
 
 A housewife. 
 
Yes, she… 
 
Girl scouts. 
 
Joined at fifty-four?

And then she was like a hostess, after my dad passed away, a hostess at 
restaurants. 
 
But I had girl scouts for fifteen years. I was with my oldest daughter’s 
troop, and then I was with Carol’s troop, and then I was an organizer for 
the girl scouts and helped out. 
 
The Council, yes. 
 
The Council. 
 
Yes, so, I think that’s why… 
 
So it was a whole different world for me. 
 
…why we were such good troupers. We were girl scouts, by golly! We 
could do anything! (Laughter) 
 
Well, are there any smells that you miss from the circus? 
 
Popcorn. 
 
Oh, popcorn! (Laughter) We can still get that memory… 
 
But it’s not the same smell. 
 
But it’s not the same. 
 
Popcorn. 
 
No, when we worked in the concession stand we sold five items; hot 
dogs, popcorn, cotton candy, snow cones, and… 
 
Coca-cola. 
 
…Coca-cola, right. That’s where, “Get your popcorn and Coca-cola 
right here!” (Laughs) 
 
“Fresh, hot popcorn!” Yes, it’s kind of funny. I work at the VFW Bingo 
Hall now, and I sell the bingo cards. Well, when I first started working 
there—I always holler out now, it’s like, the last call on packs and half-
packs, which are bingo cards. But when I first started one time I said,

“Circus toys!” and everybody looked at me like I was crazy, because I 
worked novelty stands for a long time. (Laughter) Now, when I sell the 
cards to them I always go, “Good luck! Good luck, honey,” all these 
little old ladies that play bingo. When I first started selling them I’d say, 
“Enjoy the show.” (Laughter) Because when you’d sell a ticket to the 
performance I would say, “Enjoy the show.” 
 
Well, what do you miss most about circus life? 
 
The closeness, I think, with people, with us, each other. 
 
Yes. 
 
And the fun. 
 
Like a big family group. 
 
Yes, you miss that. 
 
There’d always be people on the show that it’d be like, “Oh, God! Here 
comes so and so,” but most of the people, you’re just with them in such 
a close-knit group for nine months out of the year. 
 
Being in a cookhouse, I think a lot of the fellows and—mostly fellows—
would come and ask for advice. (Laughs) 
 
Yes, they’d look at her like a mom. 
 
Like a grandma or mom. I’d think, “Ugh.” (Laughter) 
 
“I’m not the therapist here. I’m the cook.” (Laughter) 
 
Yes, “Is it palm reading?”  
 
Miss the most? The closeness of the family group. I mean, you really felt 
like everybody on the show was your family. 
 
You really do. 
 
You care about everybody as if they’re your sister or your brother, or 
your aunt or your uncle. 
 
Well, if I was checking the oil in my truck, I’d put my hood up. I’d be 
on the lot, ready to go or something, “What’s the matter? What’s the 
matter?” Right away, several would come over, “No, no. I’m just 
checking my oil.” It’s very attentive to each other.

Most of your friends would be circus-related? 
 
Yes, yes. I’ve lost track of all my friends I grew up with. I only have a 
couple of them that I even know where they are. Even with Facebook, 
I’ve got on there and tried to find old friends from Michigan. I just lost 
contact with everybody, but all the show people I still am friends with. 
All the show people I’ve met over the years, still communicate with 
them. 
 
Yes, my friends back in Michigan would love to get letters from me 
when I was on the road, because I would write such great… 
 
Little stories. 
 
…yes, stories and trips we’ve had, what we did. Oh, they always told 
me, “I love getting your letters!” 
 
“You’re not going to believe this!” 
 
Yes. (Laughter) 
 
You mentioned children. Is the other a son or daughter? Are they 
involved with the circus? 
 
No. None of my kids are. Well, my daughter was up until a few weeks 
ago, but she had gone back to work for Carson and Barnes, out there in 
the office with her dad, but her husband needed her help down at the tire 
shop. They were getting a little behind on paperwork, and so she decided 
that she better. 
 
And they like Hugo well enough to stay here? 
 
Well, her husband was not born and raised in the business. 
 
No. 
 
He was a town boy here. Both of his parents were… 
 
Teachers. 
 
…involved in the educational field here in town. Yes, but she told him—
they started going together in eighth grade, went together all the way 
through college, and he wanted to marry her. She said, “I’ll tell you right 
now. It’s show business or nothing. I’m not leaving show business.” 
And by golly, he went out! The first year, I don’t know how well he

liked it. David put him working elephants. (Laughter) He says, “I’m 
going to break him in right!” But, boy, Drake turned out to be quite a 
trouper, and he loved it. When they decided to sell the show, I think he 
was just as heartbroken as everybody. Watching the show go out—well, 
they live right across the street from winter quarters there. “What are 
they doing over there?” Watching it all the time. 
 
Was it hard to readjust to town life, after you both left the circus? 
 
Oh, yes. 
 
Yes. 
 
Yes, and it’s like every year, come spring, you start getting that, “Oh, I 
want to go!” 
 
I know. I miss it. I’ve got so many albums of pictures. I get lonesome, I 
just pull out an album and I’ll leave it out on my davenport. She’ll come 
in and, “Mother!” 
 
I’ll go, “Oh, Mom!” (Laughter) I sit there looking through these. Yes, 
she’s got lots of photo albums. 
 
Bring back memories. 
 
Yes. 
 
So you would do it again? 
 
Oh, yes. I wish I was younger, I would. 
 
Yes. Yes, I would do it in a heartbeat. I’d go now, but, like I wouldn’t 
leave her here. My sister lived here before, but then she moved off to… 
 
Arizona. 
 
…Arizona. Her and her husband moved to Arizona so it’s like… 
 
We’re still buddies. (Laughs) 
 
Yes, I wouldn’t leave Mommy here all summer by herself. 
 
She can go, too. 
 
Yes, I’ll keep the trailer clean. (Laughter)

Well, there’s been a lot of people, like B.K. [Silverlake], I think one of 
her aunts or something traveled on the show until she was eighty-nine, 
ninety years old. She just kind of rode along in the trailer. 
 
You could be a greeter. 
 
Yes, there we go. 
 
I know, I always… 
 
Like the Wal-Mart greeter! (Laughter) 
 
Yes. (Laughs) 
 
“Enjoy the show!” 
 
I always wanted to have a grandma act with my dog. 
 
Yes. (Laughs)  
 
Because I taught her so many little tricks. 
 
Well, as we get ready to wind down, if you could think of your most 
favorite thing about the circus, what would come to mind? 
 
There’s too many. 
 
Too many things to really pinpoint one. 
 
I mean, there is not just one thing that… 
 
No. I love the music and… 
 
From the camaraderie to watching the tent go up in the morning, 
watching the tent go down at night… 
 
Watching the tent go down… 
 
Yes, I mean, driving over the road, the traveling, the seeing the 
country… 
 
There are so many thrills. 
 
It’s just—there’s nothing like it in this world. People say, “Boy, I bet 
you’re glad to be home.” No, I’m not. I would much rather be on the 
circus. Like, when I’d bring the kids home from school and we’d be at a

baseball game or something, all the other mothers, “Oh, I bet you’re glad 
to be home.” “Are you kidding me?” “Well, isn’t it hard out there?” No, 
everyday is so routine. I mean, you have your little problems that you 
have to work through, but you get up in the morning, you drive to the 
next town, you get to the town, you set your trailer back up because 
before you leave you have to set… 
 
All your little knickknacks… 
 
…all your little thingies down… 
 
…you stick them down so they don’t fall. (Laughs) 
 
Put the coffee maker into the sink, so it doesn’t slide off the counter… 
 
In the cookhouse. 
 
…and just little things like that. Always do your dishes the night before 
so your sink is empty so you can set your coffee maker or whatever else 
you have on your counter into the sink to travel over the road. Little 
things like that. 
 
I’d have a geranium I’d set out on my little stool in front of my trailer. 
(Laughs) That’s my home. I’d bring it in at night and set it in my shower 
section. (Laughs) 
 
You’d get to the lot, you’d set your house back up, run through, takes—
shoot, you could clean a whole trailer from top to bottom in less than an 
hour. (Laughs) My job on Kelly Miller was to go to the cookhouse, get 
the grocery list, head to the store and buy the groceries, come back and 
then your day is your own until show time. I mean, if you want to go to 
the beach, if you want to go to town, shopping… 
 
If I laid down… 
 
If you want to take your nap. 
 
If I laid down and took a nap, I had a picture of a little girl asleep, and 
I’d put that picture in my window so when Sasha would come over—she 
was six—and she’d see that picture, “Don’t knock on there because 
Grandma’s asleep.” (Laugher) 
 
Taking her nap. 
 
It was funny. The girls, Barbara’s two little daughters…

grandma’s asleep.” “How do you know your grandma’s asleep?” “See 
that picture?” She said, “When she has that picture in the window she’s 
taking a nap.” Cute little things you remember like that. 
 
Well, most of your interaction was with the back lot more than the 
public? 
 
Oh, yes. 
 
Yes, and the cookhouse. 
 
Right. 
 
Yes, the guys would always swing through, “What are we having today? 
Ooh! That sounds good.” You could always tell what went over good 
and what didn’t by the trash can. We had the trash can setting just off 
from the window there. 
 
We didn’t have very many meals thrown away. 
 
No, but once in a while you’d come up with something, “Mom, we’re 
going to create something today.” It’s like, “Well, we’ll never do that 
one again!” When you see the trash and everybody threw it out. 
(Laughs) 
 
I think someone earlier told us that D.R. liked beans of any kind and had 
to have beans with every meal. 
 
Oh, yes. They had beans every meal over there. 
 
Would there be something on Kelly Miller that you’d always have to 
have in the cookhouse? 
 
Not really, no. 
 
Not strawberry JELL-O every night? 
 
No. 
 
No. (Laughs) 
 
We used to do cakes a lot. They loved our cakes. We figured out that 
three cake mixes filled up one of those great big…

…baking pans. We’d just bake cakes for them and they loved them. 
Make a little frosting to go on them. 
 
Yes, we’d celebrate birthdays and things like that, too. 
 
Yes, yes. We had the nuns on the circus. Have you heard about the nuns, 
sisters? 
 
Someone mentioned them, but didn’t tell us a great deal about them. 
 
Oh, that was wonderful! 
 
The Little Sisters, they started out—was there two—three of them. 
 
Three and then… 
 
It’s an order of nuns that their mission, I guess, is to be out amongst the 
public and everything. 
 
Yes. 
 
And I guess they learn that traveling with circuses, you really get to 
meet a lot of public. Although they all worked on the circus, but they 
didn’t want the public to know that they were nuns. Like one of them 
took tickets on the front gate, one of them sold tickets, and one of them 
worked in the cookhouse, as a helper in the cookhouse.  
 
We still keep in contact with them. 
 
Oh, yes. 
 
They’ve gone back to—where are they now? 
 
Maryland, Maryland. 
 
Maryland. 
 
They’re from the Maryland area, yes. But they have traveled with

circuses and they’re wonderful little ladies. 
 
They didn’t wear their habits, then, if they didn’t want people to know? 
 
No, they wore like a chambray shirt, navy blue pants, and a wooden 
cross. A hand-carved wooden cross was their thing. 
 
I remember saying goodbye to them in Paris, at that last show. 
 
Yes, they were here last spring for Carson and Barnes’ opening. 
 
In Paris. 
 
Yes. Yes, they traveled with—they were on our show for, gosh, like six 
years, I think. 
 
Wow. 
 
Wonderful. And they were like the little psychologists.  
 
Yes, they had the little chapel in their trailer. 
 
Yes, they had a truck that had a little chapel in the back and everything. 
 
So when they asked you for advice, send them over there. (Laugher) 
 
Yes, well, it got to the point after awhile, the working men, when they’d 
realize they were nuns, they were a little scared at first, some of the guys 
shy of them. But then afterwards, they get to know them and… 
 
Sweet, sweet girls. 
 
They would counsel a lot of people. 
 
Would they get paid or were they volunteering? 
 
Oh, yes. They got paid, but they didn’t want a lot. They said, “We just 
want the going rate for this job,” or something. They were a big plus on 
the show, a lot of fun to have around, and just moral support. (Laughs) 
 
It gave the community even more of a feel of a community. 
 
Yes. 
 
I can’t imagine the sunrise, if you’re putting up the tent at sunrise, that

Sunrise was usually driving over the road. In spring we were always 
heading east and it’d be like, “Oh!” Sometimes you’d top a hill, or 
something, and that sun was just coming up. 
 
I remember taking a picture of the sunrise, and then I took the picture of 
the sunset. I was telling Mary, I said, “I took a picture of the same sun.” 
(Laughter) 
 
Yes, same day. 
 
It just seemed so strange. It wasn’t a different sun. It was the same one. 
(Laughter) 
 
Well, is there anything else you’d like to share with us before we close 
out today, anything we may have missed? 
 
Oh, there’s a lot you’ve missed. (Laughter) I could ramble on and on and 
on. 
 
Yes, I started to pick up fancy stones, “Oh! Isn’t that pretty? Isn’t that 
pretty?” Carol says, “Mother, your trailer is going to get heavier and 
heavier if you keep picking up stones!” (Laughs) 
 
That movie with Lucille Ball and the one long trailer, it’s like, “That’s it, 
Mom!” (Laughs) 
 
We’re cutting you off. 
 
Yes, although I remember I picked up a Petoskey rock in Michigan, 
which is only found in Michigan. 
 
In Michigan. 
 
I happened to find, on the lot, one of the biggest ones I’ve ever seen. 
 
They’re beautiful stones. 
 
It was, like, that big. (Gestures) I put it in the back of the truck, hauling 
it home, and I brought the kids home for school in the fall. Well, the 
engine blew in our truck. David went and bought a new truck. I said, 
“What about my rock in the back?” He said, “Oh, I threw it in the 
dumpster.” I was like, “Oh, no!” I’ve often thought about that, years 
down the line some archeological…

Yes, yes, “and this big of one!” Yes, you just… 
 
Good memories. 
 
Oh, yes. 
 
There are so many stories and so many fond memories that… Yes, I 
mean, I can’t think of any really, really bad, bad, bad things. I mean, yes, 
you’ve got your blow-downs or… 
 
Well, there are a lot of storms… 
 
…accidents and… 
 
…that are scary—and wind. Oh, gosh! When I went out with that first 
truck and camper on, oh, the wind was just—that camper, I said, 
“(Gasps)” and that was that first year out. 
 
“Hang on, Mommy!” (Laughs) 
 
I was scared. I thought that camper would blow me over. 
 
Any close calls with any of the circus animals? 
 
Well, like I say, the llama spit on me. I was all dressed up ready to go to 
work, and I walked by the llamas and they were fighting. (Makes 
spitting sound)  And this green spit all down me. I had to turn around 
and go back to my trailer. (Laughs) 
 
One time we had a tiger on our show. It was named Sasha. Well, 
because I went and did the buying for the cookhouse, I would buy the 
cat food every day. So I decided this one day, “I’m going to go feed the 
cat.” So I get the broom and lift up the slush door on the bottom of the 
cage, and I’m throwing this chicken in to him, and he’s eating it. Well, I 
thought that was pretty cool so I started going every day, right? Well, 
one day I see him shake his head when he was eating and something 
flew out. I went and looked at it and it was one of his little teeth—her 
teeth, I should say. It was like, “Wow! I got a tiger tooth!” Well, they

shed their teeth as they’re growing, which I wasn’t aware of until after 
that. So I had a necklace made out of that tooth, of course. But I got to 
where I wasn’t afraid of this tiger at all. I mean, she was a good tiger and 
everything. So I’m throwing the food in there, and I’ve got the broom. 
One day she grabbed that broom, and I had a hold of it. My whole arm 
goes in the cage, and you think, “Whoa!” because you don’t realize their 
strength. I mean, she wasn’t trying to get me. She was playing with the 
broom, but it scared the… 
 
It still scared you… 
 
Yes. That’s the only close call that I can think of with an animal that I 
had. 
 
Well, I was having oatmeal left over some mornings, and I would put it 
in a Coca-cola carton, a cut down one, and take it in to the sideshow to 
feed to the camel, Burt the camel. The midway was full of people so I 
thought, “Well, I’ll go in the back way and go under the tent and go in.” 
So I went in the back and this baby elephant was in the corner, and he 
grabbed my arm. I said, “No, no, no! No, no!” and finally, she let me go, 
and then I took it over to Burt, and I gave it to Burt and he goes (Imitates 
camel) after he eats it and there’s oatmeal flying! (Laughter) 
 
It’s always something new and exciting. 
 
Oh, always. When Sasha was six, the lion was sleeping, and its tail was 
hanging out of the cage. I said, “Should Grandma pull his tail?” She 
said, “Yes, yes!” So I went over and pulled his tail, and that tail went 
inside. The lion looked at me and then sat back down and went to sleep. 
(Laughter) But how I got my little dog, it was on the road, full of fleas 
and ticks, so was hers. Mine was running for the elephants. It was a… 
 
Stray. 
 
…stray. I jumped out of the concession stand. I said, “That dog’s going 
to get killed!” So I jumped out, and I grabbed that little dog, and I took it 
to my camper. I threw it in the camper and went back in the concession 
stand, and Carol said, “Guess what?” I said, “What?” She said, “I got me 
a dog.” I said, “Guess what? I got me a dog.” (Laughter) We both picked 
up a dog on the road that day. 
 
That same day, yes. Just mutts, but they wind up being the best. 
 
Yes, eighteen years we’ve both had them.

Yes. Munchy and Peanut. Mine was Peanut. I named her Cleo because 
she loved the men. (Laughter) I thought, “Well, she should be 
Cleopatra.” 
 
I didn’t know that! (Laughs) 
 
She never would answer to Cleo and somebody said, “Oh, she’s a cute 
little peanut!” She perked up her ears, and I said, “That’s her name.” 
 
Very fitting. 
 
Yes. 
 
But Peanut and Munchy never liked each other. 
 
No, they didn’t. 
 
I think they were strays, and when they got good homes they didn’t want 
the other one to hone in on their good home. 
 
Possible. 
 
Yes. But the Humane Society was called to come out and pick up the 
dogs, and this man came over to the concession stand and said, “I’m 
from the Humane Society, and I’m ready to pick up some dogs. Have 
you seen them?” 
 
No! (Laughs) 
 
And we looked at each other, and we said, “She’s got one and I’ve got 
one.” (Laughs) He said, “Don’t throw them away on the next town.” I 
wish he knew we kept them… 
 
Yes, eighteen years. 
 
…eighteen years. 
 
Funny stories, her first year on the Carson and Barnes and we’re on the 
concession stand. When we get down to New Orleans, we’re playing just 
outside of New Orleans and there’s a cop on the lot, just patrolling. He 
comes over, and he starts talking to us. Well, he’s telling us all the 
stories about this town. I mean, historical stuff. 
 
In a Cajun…

In this super Cajun voice. It was fabulous. Mom says, “I want to get his 
voice on recording.” So she says, “I’m going to go to my house and get 
the recorder.” 
 
I’ve got my little tape recorder. 
 
And she says, “Then let’s call him back over here and get him to tell us 
all those stories again.” This is during the show time, and we’re not busy 
because everybody is in… So we call him back over and it’s like, “What 
were you saying about that?” and he’d tell that whole little story again. 
We were just cracking up! We had the recorder down underneath. I 
don’t know if that’s legal, but it was too funny. We used to do crazy 
things like that all the time. 
 
When we were in New Orleans I saw this piece of iron that had broken 
off of one of those beautiful iron… 
 
Gates, yes. 
 
…works. I said, “Oh, I’m going to pick that up.” And I said, “No, 
somebody will pick it up and replace it.” The lady in the back of me was 
a tourist and she picked it up and took it. (Laughter) I said, “Oh, I 
should’ve picked that up!” 
 
I have a whole—at my house—rocks and stuff that I had picked up all 
over the country, different—if I’d see neat little beach rocks and 
everything, beach glass. I have bunches of it. I’ve just put all those little 
rocks along my garden out there. Some of them I still remember when I 
picked them up, certain ones that were special. David and I one time, we 
were going to join Royal Brothers Circus, up in Canada. Well, they were 
way up in northern Ontario, I believe it was. We’re looking on the map 
and it’s like, “Man! That’s a long ways to get all the way around.” Well, 
there was a little tiny road that went across. So we pulled into this gas 
station and said, “How’s this road that cuts north out of here?” They 
said, “Oh, it’s not bad.” Well, we’ve got a travel trailer. (Laughs)  
 
We’re driving it. I mean, it was like 100 miles. It would’ve been 300 
miles to go all the way around or 100 miles straight up this road, and 
we’re like, “Okay, let’s take this road.” It was like a logging road. So 
we’re driving and it’s getting worse and worse and worse. Well, we’re 
halfway. Are you going to turn around or keep going? So we kept going, 
but we stopped halfway up, and I went in the trailer to see how bad it 
was because it was such a rough road. Everything in my sink, like my 
coffee pot and all that, was just in crumbs. I mean, it had just been beat 
to pieces. I had this little lion planter that was so cute, and I loved that 
little thing, and it was just all chipped up.

Because I’ve got one. 
 
So coming out of the trailer, I see this rock sitting there and it was like 
broken in half. It was about eight inches round or something, but it was 
broken in half, perfectly. I picked that up and put it in the trailer. I still 
have that rock today and it’s like, those are little things that spark 
memories. Every time I see that rock I think about that day. We got to 
that town where the circus was, and I walked into that trailer. Everything 
was covered in dust, because it was a dirt road. 
 
Oh, remember the lot that they burned off… 
 
Oh, yes! 
 
…before we got there? 
 
Yes. 
 
They thought it would help us by burning it off. Oh, my God! 
Everything was black… 
 
It was all black.

I mean your feet and… 
 
Soot! 
 
Yes, and then the wind blew all day and this black stuff. 
 
Oh, my goodness! 
 
I mean, by the end of the day you were just covered in black. (Laughs) 
Those are bad little stories, but they’re not so bad, right? They’re kind of 
comical when you… 
 
We could wash up, anyway.

Moose and bear and… 
 
Yes, that was a thrill. 
 
Yes. 
 
Any close calls with weather? 
 
Oh, many of times. 
 
Oh, yes. 
 
Many of times, yes. We were outside of Wichita Falls when they had 
that really—Wichita Falls, Texas—when they had that serious tornado 
down there, and they called to the circus. They had them bring our 
generator truck down to the city hall and had like a morgue set up there. 
They were bringing bodies in. Our electrician on the show—that was on 
Carson and Barnes—was down there all night. 
 
Well, they came to the circus and said we could go to their school or 
something. 
 
Yes, yes. 
 
And there were a lot of Mexicans on the road. (Laughs) 
 
They were all scared of tornadoes… 
 
They were so scared! 
 
…and they all went over there. Mom and I were sitting in my trailer and 
we were listening to the radio and they said… 
 
And then the next… 
 
Well the guy said, “It’s coming! It’s coming! Take cover!” the radio 
announcer, and all of a sudden the radio station went out, and we were 
like, “Oh, no!” (Laughs)

Well, didn’t the generator help the hospital? 
 
No, it was down at city hall. 
 
Was it the city hall? 
 
Yes, they were running something. 
 
Yes, that was a scary time. 
 
I guess if bad weather’s coming, you’re going to have to try to put the 
tent down? 
 
Yes, you can drop it, like the center poles, the poles, three or four poles 
in the tent—now, most of them are one pole where all center ring acts 
were one ring—well, no. That’s not true. There are still four poles—
well, anyway, you’d bring the peaks down. You’d drop the center poles 
down, leave the sidewall up, leave the side poles up, but you drop those 
center poles down. It would hold the whole thing down. So you’d guy 
out to the trucks, untie it from the stakes where you could and tie it to 
the trucks or park trucks along the side that the storm’s coming from to 
keep the wind from bringing it down, yes. Those are the little challenges 
that, you know… 
 
Do you remember getting a stake bite? (Laughs) 
 
Oh, yes. Stake bites, the stakes on the circus.  
 
You’re walking along the side, and you don’t happen to see that stake, 
and you get it right in your… 
 
I have several little scars on my shins that are stake bites. 
 
Those are stake bites. (Laughs) 
 
A hazard of the job. 
 
Yes, yes. And walking across the lot at night and if the stakes aren’t 
pulled yet. (Laughs) Yes, I was late to the concession stand one time,

and I was running across where the sideshow was. I thought they already

shin right open. (Laughs) Stake bites, yes. 
 
Not good if you’re klutzy.

Yes, yes. And we’re buddies. We like to hang out together, and we 
always reminisce.

Well, carnival is different than circus. 
 
We’ve had several people explain to us the difference between… 
 
Difference between circus and carnival? 
 
Carnival and circus is like night and day. It’s two different… 
 
Yes, and you were always offended when you go into somewhere and 
they’re like, “Oh, you’re with the carnival.” “No, I’m with the circus.” 
 
“We’re with the circus.” 
 
And there’s a big difference. “Oh, well, yes. I guess, kind of.” But 
people don’t understand. There really is… 
 
A big difference. 
 
Although, I know a lot of carnival people, and it’s like, they’re cool, too, 
but… 
 
I guess Hugo may be a little more accepting since… 
 
Yes, because the shows have been here so many years. For instance, the 
banks here in town. If you blew an engine on the road, and you banked 
at that bank, you call, “Hey, I need a loan. Our truck just blew.” No 
problem, they’d wire you the money. They knew that. 
 
Well, when we came back to town we spent our money here. 
 
Right. 
 
Yes. 
 
And this town understands the show people. 
 
Right, right. 
 
That we are just normal people. We’re not just a bunch of freaks and 
geeks. (Laughs) 
 
Right.

The needs of the showmen and… 
 
Yes, yes. Well, it’s like Joel Mashburn and them, if you were on the 
road and you needed a prescription or something, you call your doctor at 
home, they’d call in an antibiotic and Joel would have it in the mail to 
you, overnight express, the next day. Things like that. And that was what 
was nice about Hugo. That they understood our… 
 
Situations. 
 
Our situation, right. I know, Mom and I, as I was pulling in here, I 
always call her when I’m coming to town to pick her up to go do 
something. I call her when I’m passing McDonald’s and say, “Okay. I’m 
passing McDonald’s,” and she comes out. She’ll wait at the curb for me 
to pick her up. (Laughter) I said, “What did we do before cell phones?” 
Then I was thinking back on the circus and it’s like, we didn’t have cell 
phones. You had to go to a payphone. 
 
We worked in the concession stand, and this girl came up and she said, 
“Where’s a phone I can use?” 
 
It’s like, “Um, honey, there’s no phone out here in this cow pasture.” 
 
Duh! We’re way out in a field. 
 
Now we have GPS [Global Positioning System] units so you won’t get 
lost. 
 
Oh, yes. 
 
Yes, yes. Show business nowadays must be so much easier. (Laughs) 
 
Oh, yes. Yes, definitely easier. 
 
Yes, I mean, with computers, and they have computers on the show 
now… 
 
Well, the only thing we had was… 
 
…because you can have remote connection. 
 
Right. 
 
Do they still use the arrows? 
 
Oh, yes.

Oh, sure. 
 
That’s just something I don’t think will ever go away. 
 
Every circus has a different color arrow. 
 
Yes, that’s kind of a funny story. We were on King Brothers Circus, 
which was owned by the same corporation as Clyde Beatty Circus, and 
we went to Clyde Beatty Circus. Then the next year we went back to 
King Brothers Circus, and we crossed arrows up in Massachusetts or 
something. I’m driving, it’s night—we used to travel at night over 
there—and all of a sudden I looked at the arrows and I was like, “Oh! 
I’m on Beatty show arrows! These aren’t King Brothers arrows.” 
(Laughter) Because I was used to looking for them the year before. I 
rode with David. I didn’t have to drive then, but I’d ride with David and 
I’d say, “There’s arrows,” so I was used to looking for them. I 
accidentally turned on some of their arrows and wound up—yes, I was 
about forty miles off track and had to turn and backtrack and figure out 
where I missed the turn. 
 
Well, do you think the circus can continue into the future? Do you think 
there will always be a market for the circus? 
 
I would hope so. The only problem is there are so many rules and 
regulations now. 
 
Red tape has gotten so bad now for animals… 
 
Yes, rules and regulations are so strict. 
 
…and in the cookhouse, everything. 
 
Yes, health inspectors. There are inspectors for everything. 
 
Which is good for the cookhouse and that, but for animals, we take good 
care of our animals.  
 
Right. They make our living, why would we abuse them? 
 
I guess you’re subject to these inspections every time you stop. 
 
Yes. 
 
Oh, every town, every town.

Every town. Every town has people come out. 
 
Especially out east and stuff.  
 
Yes. 
 
We used to be inspected every single day, like the health department, 
come to the concession stand. It’s like, “Excuse me. We’re cleaner than 
most restaurants, probably, because we have to pass these inspections 
every day.” 
 
Every town, they come out. 
 
The health department goes to a restaurant once a year in town and gives 
them their health inspection. We’re inspected every day by a different 
inspector every day. I don’t know. It’s just the expense… 
 
Has gotten so bad. 
 
…to be out there doing it now. 
 
Well, gas and everything else is up, groceries are up. 
 
David’s and my first travel trailer cost six thousand dollars, brand new. 
Our last one cost like forty. (Laughs) And that’s in a period of twenty-
five years, the expense, and just the cost of a truck nowadays, to buy a 
truck. If you’re in show business, you’re not going to go out and buy an 
old, used truck. You depend on that truck. You’ve got to have a good 
vehicle. 
 
You have to have a good running truck. 
 
Right. And the cost of a truck is thirty, forty thousand dollars now. 
 
Everything is so high. 
 
And now, trailers are eighty, 100 thousand dollars, for a travel trailer! 
Well, if you’re going to go out on the road and try to make those 
payments, you have to make so much money. 
 
Right. 
 
Well, being a circus owner, you can’t afford to pay that much, because 
you’re not making that much. So you have to keep your nut down. 
 
And every day it’s different, because one day you can have a full house

and the next day you’ve got nothing. 
 
Right. 
 
It’s not every day a full house. 
 
You average it out. “You know how much your nut is per week, with 
advertising—advertising has gone astronomical. Nowadays, people 
don’t even read the newspaper anymore. 
 
Right. 
 
They watch the idiot tube. 
 
And they can see performances on the TV… 
 
Right.  
 
“Why go to a circus?” they’ll say. That’s sad. 
 
It’s sad. It’s sad. But, yes. 
 
See, years ago… 
 
Of course, it’s like the books. 
 
Yes. 
 
It’s being phased right out. 
 
Years ago, people waited for that circus to come to town. I can 
remember that when I was a child. The circus coming to town was a big 
deal. 
 
And it’s still is in some small little towns where they have no other 
entertainment. 
 
Right. 
 
But most shows can’t exist just playing on those little towns. The areas 
you make your good money in is usually around the big cities and stuff. 
 
‘Round Chicago and… 
 
Yes, and nowadays it’s—and people don’t have the time.

People seem to be busier. 
 
That was one thing about coming home to town with the kids, and 
people would say that to me. It’s like, “No! Circus life is so routine.” 
Here, every day, I have to think, “Okay. We’ve got soccer practice at 
this time. We’ve got dance class at this time, and I’ve got a meeting with 
so and so at this time.” You’ve got to keep a daily planner, here. On the 
circus, you don’t. (Laughs) Every day is the same routine, going along.  
 
Just don’t blow the arrows and you’re good. (Laughs) 
 
Just a different town, yes, just a different town, different life. And for 
kids, what better thing than to have a different backyard to play in every 
day, right?  
 
Every parent watched the kids on the show. 
 
Every other parent, all the show people. 
 
We watched all the different kids. 
 
I can remember guys coming to me and saying, “Hey… 
 
I would worry because when I was home, before I came on the show, I 
used to worry about Sasha. She’d say, “Mother, we all have our eyes on 
our kids.” 
 
Yes. And many of times, you’d see the working guys going over to the 
kids at the park or something and saying, “Hey guys, this is a little too 
far away. You need to come back.” The first year on Kelly Miller, my 
son Kelly was like two, three years old. I’d be walking a lot. People 
knew I was looking for him, “He’s over there with Philippe”—who was 
the boss canvasman, his little buddy. “Okay.” “Yes, he ate in the 
cookhouse. I made sure he got fed,” because I was so busy that year, 
doing things. Everybody on the show looked out for my kid. (Laughs) 
 
It’s a big family. 
 
Yes. 
 
Yes, that’s what it is. 
 
Yes, it is. Yes, it is. And that’s what I say. They’re all your brothers and 
sisters and aunts and uncles, and that’s just the way it goes. 
 
You’re making me sad. (Laughter)
