THE other fine May morning 
I 
stopped into a 
saloon below, 
Among the gang that stood around 
Was a 
friend of mine from sweet Sligo. 
He told to me confidentially, 
My good name was in danger, oh! 
Hu said that I 
would rob a 
church, 
And cs-vora Tom Collins told him so. 
CIIORUS. 
He said I 
was a 
big galoot, 
If he caught me he'd mash me snoot. 
With my revolver him I'll shoot, 
If I 
catch that Tom Collins, oh ! 
I 
searched the city far and wide, 
And into each saloon did go, 
From the Old Hook Dock to Hudson side, 
A looking for Tom Collins, oh! 
The barkeepers would laugh at tale, 
Said I 
was fresh from Erin, oh, 
And that I 
would swipe an overcoat, 
And swore Tom Collins told them so. 
He said I 
was, &c. 
•

The conversation that took place, 
Made me become more desperate oh! 
He said I 
always run my face, 
And never let a 
dollar go, 
He said if I 
wanted a 
bit to ate, 
To an undertakers I 
would go, 
And steal a 
dead man's coffin plate, 
And swore Tom Collins told him so. 
He said I 
was, &c. 
If I'm arrested I'm insane, 
Vexations come so fast you know, 
lie said enough to turn me brain, 
If I 
kill him they'll let me go, 
I've worn out a 
pair of 19 shoes, 
Traveling round the city, oh! 
I 
understand by the " Daily News" 
They captured that Tom Collins, oh! 
He said I 
was, &c. 
I'll dis-cribe this back-biter to you, 
So him you'll shurely re-cog-nise, 
He's six foot two in his stocking feet, 
He's the first man who invented lies. 
And if you should like to take a 
stroll, 
To Catherine market you can go, 
You'll find him hung to a 
telegraph pole, 
Notorious Tom Collins, ob. 
He said I 
was, ttc.

Original Version. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1874, by A. J. 
FISHER, in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
DER cruel war vent over, 
Der rebel flag went down, 
We come back to specie payment, 
Und kick greenbacks out ov town, 
So I 
speak mit every snoozer, 
Vat isn't got no wealth, 
To go down to the court house quick, 
Und give up to the board of health. 
(Takes out yellow flAg.) 
Then here's the flag, 
Dot goot old flag, 
Dot's de flag vat's often seen, 
Down on Staten Island, boys, 
Der flag of quarantine. 
If der landlord kicks you out, 
Of course dot's awful hard. 
You take your wife and family, 
Und sleep in der lumber yard, 
A man comes mit a 
hammer, 
Der crowd dey come around, 
He hits dem tables und dem chairs, 
nd quickly knocks dem down. 
(Takes out auction flag.) 
Den here's the flag of Chatham street, 
Dots der flag dot cost me dear, 
I 
sell it to you for two an' a 
half, 
Der flag of the auctioneer. 
The emblem of dem countries, 
Dot I 
sing so much about, 
Dere is one ov de noblest nations, 
Dot I 
have left me out, 
tind dot is good old Germany. 
It stirs the Deitcher's heart, 
Den give three cheers for Prussia, boys, 
Der land of Count Bismarck, 
(Takes out Irish flag ) 
Den here's the flag of Germany, 
Oh, long may it wave away, 
Und every lager bier saloon, 
Dot stands by Avenue A.

SWIM OUT, YOU'RE OVER YOUR HEAD: 
Written and Sung by ED. H ARRIGAN. 
Entered according to the Act of Congre.s, in the year 1874, by A. 
J. 
FtsnEn, in the Office or the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
AT the Battery I 
landed one morning in May, boys, 
A 
stranger unknown in this land, 
The same as Christopher Columbus the hero, 
Who no one would take by the hand. 
I've worked, I've struggled, I've la.bored, 
By the sweat of my brow to get bread, 
Now I'm tould by the young generation, 
To swim out, I'm over my bead. 
ClIORTJS. 
They say Shoot the Hat upon Sunday, 
Take a 
walk round the block, go to bed; 
Part your hair in the middle, McNally, 
Swim out for you're over your head. 
I 
belong to an organization of nine, boys, 
Who'd shurely refuse you a 
drop, 
Unless you were taken wid terrible cramps, 
Whin you drink ' till ould death makes you stop. 
But since I 
have became a 
mimber, 
I'm always confined to my bed, 
Now I'm tould by the grand committee, 
To swim out, I'm over my head. 
They say shoot, &c. 
They say I 
have plinty of chin for to give 3 
ou, 
I 
never mind wasting my breath,' 
I'm acquainted wid all of the boul I 
un3ertakers, 
Who'd plant you whin I 
talk you to death, 
By heavens I 
never will tumble, 
I'll drop to the bottom like lead, 
They say toke a 
moon or a 
jumble, 
swim out, for you're over your head, 
They say shoot, &c.

And a

A

With plenty of water to make good milk, 
And all the hen's a

Somewhere upon an Island; 
Or suppose you meet another flood, 
You'd wish you were on dryland.

He's a 
good looking boy, there is no doubt; 
But his head it can't be level.

THE OLD HATE 
Written and composed by NED lanameN, and sung by him. 
In his original sketch, entitled INNOCENCE AT Homie 
Ain— Going to Mass last Sunday. 
MY name is McNamarra, 
Fm an American Cit-i-zan; 
I'm proud you know, 
Wherever I 
go, 
I'm a 
true born Irishman; 
There's one thing, me boys, I'd have youtknow. 
And I've come to tell ye that, 
It's the seventeenth of March, 
Whin, as stiff as starch, 
I 
parade with my old hat. 
• 
CHORUS. 
For it's down Broadway I 
march so gay 
Wid Cornelius, Barney and rat— 
The people shout whin I 
turn out, 
And parade with my old hat, 
That hat was made in Dublin, 
In the -Year of ninety-eight; 
'Twas never called in and ye can't beglaa 
To say it'' out e 
date, 
11 
It's traveled the wide world over, 
From Ire1;:nd to Bombay, 
And the only time it can lie seen 
on St. Patrick's day. 
For It's down, SA, 
Thin give three cheers for the hat I 
wear, 
Before it is too late, 
And nine more cheers for Patrick's day, 
The day we celebrate. 
And when you see me on parade, 
I'll raise me hat to ye, 
I'll invite ye all to come and call, 
And join my compauy. 
For it's down, 150.

First Lover. 
I'VE just arrived in town to day, 
To see the girl I 
love, 
She lives in yonder little cot, 
Site is my turtle dove; 
I 
know I've got a 
rival, 
That comes here on the sly, 
I'm bound to have the girl you bet, 
At least I'm going to try. 
Oh, my, the girl she must be mine, 
With her Grecian bend stuck out, behind, 
I'm bound to have the girl you know, 
The:fairest in the land, 
And I 
never will be satisfied, 
Until I 
take her hand. 
• 
I 
wonder who that feller was, 
He thinks he cuts a 
shine, 
He comes around the girl I 
love, 
And very soon I'll find; 
He'd better quickly take a 
walk, 
On him I'll put a 
head, 
And send him home with his Ma, 
She'll put him right in bed. 
Oh, my, the girl, & e... 
Both. 
Oh, what's the matter? excuse me, sir. 
What was you doing here? 
Second Lover. 
I

Now don't you interfere.

For you was now on time.

FOGARTY MUSKETEERS. 
Originally sung by CONROY & DLLY. 
(0_ 617 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1574, by A. 
FIsnEn, in the Office of the Librarian of Congress at Washington. 
YOU'VE heard of the Mulligan Guards, 
And Captain Jinks so gay, 
But we're the Fogarty Musketeers, 
We're very proud to say, 
We charged each man five dollars a 
head, 
And how do you like our style? 
Our company is rather small— 
We fall in single file. 
CHORUS. 
We've been turning out for years, 
Give us three hearty welcome cheers, 
Stop the car, shout hurrah, 
For the Fogarty Musketeers. 
We had the Curbstone band, 
He played March on the Rhein, 
And the deadheads on the sidewalk, 
Did pivot to the time. 
We went up Worth street, and down Broadw.4r, 
And then through Manhattan Alley, 
Of course we stopped in Mulberry street, 
To get a 
wreath off Mrs. Zallie. 
We've been turning, &c. 
When we arrived at East New York, 
The band did play away, 
The nigger he commenced to kick, 
And squealed out for his pay. 
Of course that bursted the company up, 
And filled my eyes with tears, 
And I 
knew I'd never turn out again, 
With no Fogarty Musketeers. 
We've been turning, &c.

I 
AM a

And educated to a

I

In the Daniel Webster, across the sea. 
In the Fourteenth Ward I

In a

By perseverance I

And went to the front like a 
solid man. 
CHORUS. 
Go with me and I'll trate you dacent; 
I'll set you drunk, and I'll fill the can. 
As I

He's a

At any party or any ratite 
I

As conspicuous General Granite, boys,

Pm called upon to address the meeting, 
Without regard to clique or clan;

Bekase, you know, I'm a

Go with me, &c. 
I

My constituents, they all go there 
To enjoy the summer's recreation ? 
And the refreshing East River air. 
I'm known in Harlem, I'm known in Jarsey; 
I'm welcomed hearty on every hand. 
Wid my re-ga lay, on Patrick's day, 
I 
march away like a 
solid man. 
CHORUS. 
For oppositions or politicians, 
Take my word, i

I 
AM a 
jolly Dutchman, 
From Yarmany I 
came, 
And if you wants to find me out, 
Fritz Donderbeck's my name. 
The reason I 
came of this place, 
Is to told you of a 
spree 
Yot happened to a 
fellow called Hans, 
And an another one—dots me. 
Hans and his gal was married, oh, 
I 
bet you five dollars dat was so, 
And all dem fellows from down below, 
Come right away quick to the spree, 
There was Gotleb and Mike, 
And Wigenstein and crazy Ike, 
There was big nose Jake, the fool, 
And Openheimer and me; 
Openheimer he got drunk, 
And come down on his head ker.plunk, 
Just as Gotleb got him on his knees, 
They both fell down in a 
plate of Dutch cheese, 
Hoop la, set 'em up again, 
Knock ' em down again. 
Set 'em up again, 
Donder vedder set 'em up again, 
Drunken Dutchmen was we. 
24 
tell you we had lots of fun, 
And plenty lager bier. 
Fritz ileuzenbaum, oh, he got mad, 
And tried to bite off my ear, 
I 
got so mad like everyding, 
Ond I 
grab him by the head, 
Ond I 
stab him with a 
pretzel 
'Till I 
thought he was gone dead; 
We kicked up a 
devil of a 
row just then, 
now just then. row just then, 
When in come four big policemen 
And wanted to take me. 
I 
said all right, 
We was only fooling because he was tight, 
When they say go ahead 
And give us a 
glass of beer, 
The policemen then, youst for spite, 
Eat so much switzer they all all got tight 
I 
tell you it was a 
hunky old night, 
And we didn't go home 
'Till they put out the light. 
Each mock, nock, set 'em up again, 
Knock 'em down again, set 'em up again, 
Dunder blitzen, set ' em up again, 
Swy glass of bier for two. 
I 
danced with a 
gal 
At the ball that night; 
Her name was Katarine, 
The reason dat I 
like dat 
1 
6 
25 
Is because she likes benzine. 
She has a 
gum bile on her nose, 
And a 
bunion on her ear, 
And a 
moud so big, I 
take my oath, 
She can swallow a 
keg of beer. 
Oh, I 
tell you, she's a 
hunky gal, 
A 
hunky gal, a 
hunky gal, 
I 
tell you she's a 
hunky gal, 
And she's going to marry me. 
I 
invite you all to come and see my Katerine. 
Don't stay, for we expect you all to see. 
Katerine can easy be found, 
For she only weigh three hundred pound. 
Oh, don't you wish dot you was me, 
To hare 3uch a 
nice little girl like she. 
Oofety gufe, you know how ' tis myself, 
You know how 'tis myself, (repeat) 
Oofety gufe, you know how ' tis myself, 
You know how the old thing works.

She lived in the country where there was no rows,

And every mornin—she'd drive de town in, 
To sell milk from her ladder's dairy. 
One day when she sold de milk all out,

WISH YOUR MOTHER WOULD COME, 
I 
HAVE to hold the child, the while my wife is out,

And don't begin to cry, oh! I 
wish your mother would come. 
Oh! I 
wish your mother would come. 
I 
gave the child some gruel, still louder tho' it cried, 
For I 
gave it boiling hot, and burnt its poor inside;

I 
used to think my wife had nought all day to do, 
But this nursing pon my life, is work enough for two ; 
Its cutting its little teeth, there's one just thro' his gum, 
Be quiet you little thief, oh ! I 
wish your mother would come. 
Oh ! I 
wish your mother would come. 
If I 
only put him down, and chance to turn my back, 
He gets the saucepan lid, and looks like a

Jack and Jill went up a

I've got on all my Sunday clothes, oh ! I 
wish your mother 
would come. 
Oh ! I 
wish your mother would come, 
Oh, husbands who will blame your wives for doing nought. 
Just stop at home one day experience must be bought ; 
I've only stopp'd two hours, and tho' you may think it rum, 
For more than half that time, oh ! I've wished your mother 
would come. 
Oh ! I've wish'd your mother would come,

HOW THAT POOR GAL SUFFERED FOR ME. 
Banjo Solo, as sang by LITTLE JENNIE BENSON, 
NOW 
listen to me and a 
story I 
will tell 
Of a 
sad calamity ; 
It happened to a 
gal, her name was Sal, 
And dearly she loved me; 
She left her home on my account 
To cross the raging sea, 
And it almost bursts my heart in two, 
When I 
think how she suffered for me. 
I 
took her out one Sunday afternoon, 
Just for to have a 
lark; 
Says she, my love, the ball is up, 
We'll go to the Central Park. 
When we got on the ice she went to strike out. 
But the ice being slippery, 
Her heels flew up, she came down ker slap! 
How that gal did suffer fo: me. 
For seven long years I 
courted her, 
With all my might and main, 
And I 
swore that none should separate me 
From my sweet Mary Jane! 
But it happened one dark and stormy night, 
To an oyster saloon went she, 
Where she -choked to death with a 
soft-shell crab, 
Which ended her suffering for me.

WOMAN'S RIGHTS. 
Originally sung by BILLY CARTER. 
Good evening, folks, I'm gIadto se o 
you alit 
But please don't think me rude, 
But let me say like, famed Paul Pry 
I 
hope I 
don't intrude. 
I 
just drooped in by accident, 
Like all the other nights 
To tell you all I 
know and think, 
About the woman's rights. 
mae women want to be Presiden' t 
Others Secretary of the State, 
But they all want to grab at the treasury 
That's a 
chance I'd like to take. 
They want to hold the Post Office 
The reason I'll unfurl, 
The want to catch those fellows writing notes 
To all the other girls. 
Now I 
go in for Woman's Rights, 
And what I 
say is true, 
I'd like the women to act like men 
And the men as women do. 
For I 
think to give the women their rights 
Would give us no distress, 
For the women then could do all the work 
And the men wear all the fine dress. 
The women scandalize the men, 
And make such a 
fuss about them. 
But I'd like the women to tell me 
What they could do without them. 
Although the men will run arounO, 
Drink Lager and carouse, 
The women find them mighty handy things! 
To have about the house.

JOLLY CROSS-TOWN NIGS. 
Written by JAMES JOHNSON. 
WE 
just arrived from across the town, 
And we are feeling mighty good, 
You see we're none of those common nigs, 
That hoists coal and shovels wood, 
But we are two of the jolliest coves, 
When dressed up in these rigs, 
We are known both far and near, 
As the jolly cross-town nigs. 
CHORUS. 
So good evening all and how do you do, (S-s-
MP.) 
Let the band play whilst we hoist up our shoe, (Sybil.). 
We throw our feet all out of shape, 
Mind, what we say is true; 
For you can all see at a 
glance 
We're so easy in our great big shoe. 
You have heard of dancing, dandy Ike, 
And pretty young Alabama Joe, 
Why they are so jealous of us 
That they hardly know what to do. 
But as for them, why, we don't care 
A 
bale of buttons or a 
box of figs; 
They have big feet and can't complete, 
With the jolly Cross-Town nigs. 
So good- evening, etc. 
Now I 
guess we have said enough, 
About this handsome, stylish pair, 
But while we're singing here to you, 
They will wonder where we are, 
We've got an invitation to a 
ball, 
So we w:11 change our rigs, 
There wi'l be none there so nobby, 
As the jolly Cross-Town Nigs. 
So good-evening, etc.

OSIAPHODOSIAPINKROOTMORIA, 
As sung by the Monarchs WALTERS & MORTON. 
OH there is a 
girl I'll tell you of 
Who all you people know; 
When first we met, I 
believe ' twas Christmas Day, 
'Oh so merrily she sailed around 
And smiled on me so true, 
I 
golly, boys, she stole—she stole my heart away; 
She looked at me, I 
winked at her 
So loving and so shy, 
And of all the pretty yaller gals was ever in this town, 
'Twas my Osiaphodosiapinkrootmoria. 
Oh the next time that I 
met with her 
'Twas at the Minstrel Hall; 
She wore a 
calico silk, a 
sunflower waterfall, 
A 
little alligator hat that roosted on her nose 
Oh, gracious me, didn't she wear good clothes! 
Her eyes are bright, they shine at night, 
She filled my heart with pain, 
The one at first sight captured me 
And caused me to sigh, 
'Twos my Osiaphodosiapinkrootmoria. 
Oh the last time that I 
saw this girl 
'Twas at the masquerade; 
I 
danced with her until the ball was o'er, 
I 
asked if I

She answered with a 
smile— 
I 
felt as I 
had never felt before— 
She took my arm, we walked along, 
To her house we came very nigh, 
Oh she squeezed my hand and hid farewell, 
As through the gate she slid,

DEAD BEAT. 
As sung by the FZESMAN SISTN1111. 
BANJO DUET, 
NOW kind friends, we'll sing of the chaps 
That you all know, that is perhaps; 
You sometimes meet them on the streets, 
I 
mean the fellows you call dead beats. 
CHORUS. 
For talk is cheap and money buys land, 
Now watch the pauper's eye. 
They dress so neat and look so fine, 
They are always around about lunch time; 
They always drink but never treat, 
I 
mean those fellows they call dead beats. 
For talk, (ie. 
Their collars are turned when cut they walk. 
Their stockings are whitened with chalk; 
They cheat the bootblacks on the street, 
And as I 
pass they holler dead beat. 
For talk, Joe. 
Now when we go to take a 
drink, 
They are always first tc take the wink, 
Its sometimes whiskey, and sometimes ak, 
And they've always got a 
lunch route for sale. 
For talk, ecc. 
Now kind friends, I've bid you adieu, 
Another night I'll sing to you; 
But if you meet us on the street, 
Dm% say the Freemans are Dead Beats.

PADDY'S TACTICS, OR NO FOOL ON A 
MARCH. 
Written by THOS. RAMSEY. Sung by JonN FIELDING. 
Ant—" Girl I 
left behind me." 
LET bogtrotters and spalpeens rail, 
At true love and affection, 
And say my Judy's false and frail, 
And will not stand inspection. 
I 
beg to say it's no such thing, 
You'll in marching order find me, 
Wid Biddy constant as the spring, 
Before me or behind me. 
SPOKEN. — By the power of Peg Blarney, some people Slways 
measure other people's bushels by their own corn. 
Thim men 
that rail most against a 
women, are no women thimselves, 
and the diva a 
bit of man is there about thim at all, at all. 
Sich spalpanes are always retreating whin their advancing, 
and whin the drum bates to arms they take to legs, and by the 
powers they are never among the killed and wounded they 
ire always found among the missing. 
March where I 
will, Lalt where I 
may, 
From private to commander, 
The devil a 
pin's to choose I 
say, 
They load and prime would slander. 
Then let them gab of that and this, 
This very same reminds me, 
I 
always left a 
parting kiss, 
Before me or behind me. 
• 
45 
SPOKEN.—That's true for me, sure, and Paddy's no fool on a 
march, I 
always keep my eye on the corporal, sure when a 
man comes to the charge of flattery with a 
woman, it's always 
a 
sign that he is manceuvering with a 
masked battery and 
manes to break the ranks of honesty, bad luck to that man, 
says I, who does not act honest to a 
woman, if he is ever so 
big a 
rogue to her. 
I 
would have such a 
fellow shot by a 
gout-martial and tried afterwards. 
Och! that's true for me. 
I 
often get sly drops of drink, 
But duty does remind me, 
Tho' quite blind drunk, I 
take the wink, 
And sober you will find me. 
Sure and love and fighting too, 
As well as fun and drinking, 
Faith woman I 
delight in too,. 
And stick to them like winking. 
SPOKEN.-06 nods and winks are mighty queer comrades, 
they are more powerful than words, they are like dogs that bite 
widout barking, or an air gun that does death widout execu-
tion. 
Faith, it aint the man says the most spakes the most, 
but he spakes most that says nothing, faith, a 
still tongue 
makes a 
wise head if it's ever so noisy—as for spalpanes, faith, 
they are as common as recruits at a 
country fair, and all 
marching under false drill and worse service. 
Right-obout-face 
is to turn their back on an honest action. 
To advance is to 
bate a 
retreat, all the good conduct they've got is bad, all the 
service they've got they never had, their good name is a 
disgrace to the regiment, their glory is dishonor, and all their 
reward is punishment, for they get stripes to their back instead 
of their arms. 
Chorus.

GALWAY MEG. 
As Sung by JENNY HUGHES. 
DID you iver see Meg, dashing Galway Meg, 
The wickedest witch in Ould Erin, 
Who has eyes like a 
sloe, and a 
bosom of snow, 
That the boys are all toasting and cheering, 
Such cheeks, och the roses and the lips (Father Moses), 
To taste them would make you quite tipsy, 
Thin whiniver you're dead or with spirits of lead, 
Take a 
smack from the mouth of this gipsy. 
Meg can clear a 
stone wall with a 
mettlesome nag, 
Leap a 
ditch with the best in the chase, 
Sound the whoop tally ho ! to the hounds on the go, 
And come out the first man in the race, 
Such an air and such hair when she springs don't you 
stare, 
But be aisey and plaise not get friskey, 
For a 
squint at her foot, and her allele to boot, 
Would warm you all over like whiskey. 
She can dance, she can sing, in the ould Irish way, 
Take a 
noggin, and swing a 
Shillelah, 
She's the belle of the fair when the girls are all there, 
And the queen of the court where she may be. 
Such a 
neck ! such a 
waist ( Och hould me, make haste,) 
To clasp them would make you onaisey, 
Your courage is gone, and you're conquered, 0

GIVE RIM ANO HIER CHANCES 
As sung by JENNIE nunwes. 
THIS world's a 
cold and selfish one, 
As many tnousands know; 
Who once were blessed with hope and joy, 
But now are fallen low. 
Whose hearts were ever kind and warm, 
or turned from grief aside; 
But always lent a 
listening ear, 
When pain and sorrow sighed. 
Then let us aid their sad distress, 
For we like them perchance, 
May crave the favor of the world, 
To give us another chance. 
We cannot search their breaking hearts, 
To know the anguish there, 
But kindly acts may heal their smart. 
And soothe their sad despair, 
For many whom you meet to-day. 
In sorrow broken down 
Possesses hearts as kind and true, 
And noble as thine own. 
4.S 
Then do not turn away from them, 
With cold and haughty glance, 
But lift your fallen brother up, 
And give him another chance. 
The riches of the world were made, 
Not for a 
selfish end; 
But that we generously might spare, 
Some, for a 
suffering friend, 
No matter what the faults may be. 
Concealed within his heart, 
To save the wretched erring one, 
Is a 
true and manly part: 
Then, when you see a 
fallen man, 
With sorrow in his glance, 
Don't crush him farther in the dust, 
But give him another chance.

JUNIUS BROWN THE TRAGEDIAN, 
Or " No Matter." 
I'M an actor who's seen better days, 
For I 
once was a 
star I've a 
notion; 
I've been toss'd about all sorts of ways 
Upon the theatrical ocean. 
But jealousy, spite and all that 
Has brought me down to but a 
seedy ' un, 
It's been all caus'd by envy—that's flat, 
, 
For I 
once was a 
heavy tragedian. 
CHORUS. 
I've been a 
bright star in my time, 
Though now I'm reduced to a 
seedy ' nn, 
In me you may please to behold, 
Junius Brown, the Tragedian. 
You have all seen my name in the bills, 
Which is Junius Antonius Brown, sirs ; 
And I 
flatter myself I 
have caused, 
Great excitement in many a 
town, sirs; 
My last " shop " was the Garrick, Whitechapel; 
In a " part" that I 
could above any fit, 
,My " screw " sirs, for only six nights 
Was two pounds and a 
half a. clear benefit. 
SPOKEN.—That was money, but what do they offer talent 
now ? I 
was actually oflered the other day twenty-five " bob " 
per week to play Othello, the Clown in the Pantomime, and do 
bill-sticking in the morning. 
Did I 
accept it? 
Blood and 
blue fire? 
Never! NEVER! but no matter, a 
time may coma 
when they will be glad to secure the services of Brown the 
Tragedian. 
I've been A 
bright star in my time, &e. 
50 
Simce Kemble none like me's been Been, 
Yet nought but bad luck is my my portiori; 
My friends say I'm better than Kean, 
That my " Richard" and " Hamlet's" a 
caution. 
They say my declaiming's a 
treat— 
In the speech over Cmsar by Antony; 
I 
can do the soft parts low and sweet, 
Likewise I 
can " pile up the agony." 
SPORE.— For two consecutive weeks was I 
the leading 
attraction at the Royal Bower, and should have startled the 
world at Drury Lane; but for professional malice. 
I 
am kept 
off the boards out of fear. 
They know I should render 
Shakespeare's great characters as they have never been ren-
dered before. 
My reading of his plays is entirely diflerent to 
Macready, Kean, Phelps, T. C. King and all those fellows— 
they know that—but, no matter, a 
time may come when they 
will cringe to Brown, the Tragedian. 
I've been a 
bright star in my time, Sze. 
I 
search through the " Era" each week 
And I " write in" when talent's required, 
But they say they don't know me, ( there's cheek, 
Of such insults and envy I'm tired). 
They offer me terms for a " super," 
Or ask if I'm up to " utility, 
But I'll starve and remain as I 
am, 
An artiste of wondrous ability. 
SPOKEN.—Me, ME! Junius Antonius Brown descend to do 
the cock in hamlet, or Bobby in the Pantomime. 
Ye Gods 
and small fishes! 
Rather would I 
descend from my pedestal 
of fame and become a comic vocalist, but no matter! NO 
MATTER ! ! 
The time may come when they will be glad to 
pile gold at the feet of Brown, the Tragedian. 
I've been a 
bright star in my time, &c.

MY NATIVE LAND SO GREEN. 
Written by F. P. CASEY. 
Sung by JOIIN FIELDING. 
(AM a 
true born Irishman, I 
came from Paddy's land, 
Where the stranger finds a welcome with the grasp of 
friendship's hand, 
Where the wit it flows spontaneously, and pleasure"' does 
abound, 
And good nature mixed together in abundance can be 
found, 
Where the boys are all so jolly at a 
pattren race or fair, 
For courting pretty girls, none with them can compare, 
They're the bravest set of boys that ever yet were seen, 
The boys of dear ould Ireland, my native land so green. 
You will surely find that Paddy, his aid will always lend, 
And be ready to assist you, if e'er you want a 
friend, 
If his cabin you should enter, you as well as me, 
He'll treat you to the very beat, quite welcome you will be, 
IIe'll share his pipes and whiskey, your spirits he willc beer, 
Oh ould Ireland you're my darling, the spot I 
love so dear, 
For true hospitality, no matter where I've been, 
There's no place like ould Irelend, my native land so green. 
If e'er you're bent on pleasure, abroad you need not roam, 
There's no such sights in foreign lands like those we have 
at home, 
52 
Killarney's lakes are beautiful as everyone must, awn, 
And if you're fond of nonsense, just kiss the Blarney stone. 
We have scenery in Wicklow, there's the Giant's Causeway 
too, 
The bay and sights round Dublin are splendid to the view, 
I 
have travelled many a 
thousand mile, strange countries 
I 
have seen, 
But none to equal Erin's Isle, my native land so green. 
Then here's success to Erin, my own dear native Isle, 
May discontent soon vanish, and plenty on her smile, 
May discord and ill-feeling be banished from thy shore, 
And prosperity shine on thee as it did in days of yore; 
I 
only wish for happiness, that our troubles soon would 
cease, 
So we might live like brothers in unity and peace, 
May trade increase and flourish and shortly will be seen, 
The people gay and happy in my native land so green.

I'VE a 
beau you mug now, who it is I'll not tell, 
So don't ask for yoLl get no reply; 
A

ltho' not a 
swell, 
For swells I've no fancy not I, 
lie's a 
true gentleman, and that is a 
rank 
Above titles, which some girls adore; 
Ali, how my heart, beats when I 
hear my dear Frank, 
Give his darling rat- a-tat at the door. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, how my heart beats whenever I 
hear 
His rat-a-tat, tat, tat, tat, tat, rat-a-tat, tat, tat, tat, 
No music's so sweet, with joy my heart beats 
When I 
hear my love knock at the door. 
At a 
pie-lie we met, one bright summer's day, 
A 
day that I 
ne'er shall forget; 
We stroll'd thro' the woods and somehow lost our way, 
And our hearts, which are not found as yet; 
But I 
think I've found his, I 
know he has mine, 
And of it may he ne'er be bereft. 
After all we've concluded 'tis but an exchange, 
And 'tis said that exchange is no theft. 
Oh, how my heart beats, &c. 
Ile has not yet proposed, but I 
think he will soon, 
My mirth I've to hide with a 
frown, 
For I 
know the dear fellow has often began, 
And as oft in confusion broke down; 
fie has vow'd to be mine, In fact we both vow'd, 
Each other to love evermore; 
where's there a 
girl whose heart beats not fast 
When she hears her love knock at the door. 
Oh, how my heart beats, & c.

STANDING AT THE GATE WITH ADA. 
Sung by JENNIE ENGEL. 
Written and composed by SAM. BAGNALL, 
ONE summer night some time ago, when birds had gone tc 
sleep, 
And little stars at heaven's gate came out to wink and peep; 
The lilies and the pretty flowers wafted sweet perfume, 
A 
shepherd's pipe was heard afar, to play this pretty tune. 
CHORUS. 
While standing at the gate with Ada, 
While standing at the gate with Ada, 
While standing at the gate with Ada, 
One evening rather late. 
r 
press'd her hand beneath the tree, the lilac kissed her cheek, 
tier pouting lips were just apart, her sigh was soft and sweet; 
The odor of her balmy breath was like sweet Indian spice, 
I 
stole a 
sweet enchanting kiss, I 
might have stole It thrice. 
While standing at the gate with Ada, &c. 
A 
naughty bee out rather late, that moment by me flew, - 
And his style quite plainly told he had been drinking dew; 
So deeming us too near his house, my cheek he quickly stung 
And as he flew into his hive right merrily he sung. 
While standing at the gate with Ada, &c. 
I 
bade my love a 
sweet good night, the hour was growing late, 
She press'd her lips against my cheek, and closed the wicket 
gate; 
Click, went the latch, the door it creaked, I 
sighed, good night 
fair maid, 
And to my love my own fond dove, I 
breathed this serenade. 
I'm waiting at the gate for Ada, &c.

Did You Ever See an Oyster Walk Dpstairs. 
Written by P. GILBERi 
I 
LOVE a 
very handsome girl with gleaming golden hair, 
My charmer will not marry me, she daily does declare: 
Upon my knees she asks me to, but in a 
knowing way,— 
She ;lyly shakes her saucy head, and then to me does say— 
CHORUS. 
Did you ever see an oyster walk up stairs ? 
Walk up stairs ? walk up stairs? 
Well, when you do, I'll marry you and share your cares, 
But not before you see an oyster walk up stairs. 
I've got a 
nicely furnished house, a 
few pounds in the bank, 
My friends assure me that I 
am good tempered, gay and frank: 
All this I 
tell my darling, but her love I 
cannot gain, 
She shuts her eyes and then replies in this annoying strain— 
Did you ever, &c. 
Fine satins, silks and laces rich, I 
say that she shall wear. 
If willing but to marry me, to buy them all I 
swear; 
To operas and theatres I 
promise she shall go, 
But still she asks the question, and so slyly wants to know— 
If I 
ever saw, &c. 
To all the oyster shops in town, I 
sadly wend my way, 
To Billingsgate I 
often go, as well as to Herne Bay; 
In hope to find an oyster that will undertaSe the task, 
But everybody laughs at me when dolefully I 
ask— 
5G 
CHORUS. 
Have you got a /eetle native that can walk -kp stairs? 
Walk up-stairs ? 
walk up-stairs ? 
For if you have, she'll marry me and shate my cares, 
But not before you sno an -)ystr walk up stairs. 
This question I 
will make my own, and use it when I 
can, 
No matter what the query is, I'll answer every man; 
For instance, if my landlord calls, demanding six month's rent 
I'll say, "Old boy, you'll get it, if you witness the event."— 
Cnonus. 
The day an artful oyster walks up stairs ? 
Walks up stairs ? 
walks up stairs ? 
For when you'd°, I'll pay it you, and ease your cares, 
But not before you see an oyster walk upstairs.

THE LITTLE HIBERNIAN HARP. 
Written and composed by Sex. BAGNALL. Sang by JENNIE ENGL. 
All! well I 
remember, one frosty December 
The winds whistled cold and the snow it fell sharp, 
I 
saw a 
young maiden whose arms were quite laden, 
She carried a 
little Hibernian harp; 
She stopped near the door of a 
mansion so stately, 
The lights from the windows shone full in her face, 
I 
thought it my duty to watch that young beauty 
Whose foot pressed the snow with such delicate grace. 
CHORUS. 
The wind whistled keenly, but she sang serenely, 
And tinkled her little Hibernian harp, 
The wind whistled keenly, but she sang serenely, 
And tinkled her little Hibernian harp. 
Bright jewels were shining, ' mid tresses entwining 
On heads of fair beauties, all blushes and sigh, 
But they saw not the beautiful jewels that sparkled 
And fell from the lids of this poor maiden's eyes 
As over the harp strings her fingers were straying 
The notes on the night wind came plaintive and slow 
The pale lamp of heaven shone forth on the maiden 
Who stood like a 
statue transfixed to the snow. 
And the wind, &c. 
A
58 
I 
spoke to this maiden, whose heart was so laden, 
Who stood so forlorn in the streets for a 
while, 
her sobs wrung my heart as she answer'd me sadly, 
And said I 
am far from the Emerald Isle : 
My parents are dead, and I 
wander dejected, 
In search of a 
boy that I 
love and adore; 
lie's long since departed from me broken-hearted, 
And I 
am alone far from Erin's green shore. 
The wind whistled, &e. 
Need I 
say, I 
saw her, with bright hopes before her, 
Embark in a 
vessel for Erin's green shore, 
I 
watched her on deck till the evening's dark shadows 
Shut out from my sight, and I 
saw her no more; 
On a 
cold winter's night as I 
sit by the fire. 
And mournful winds whisper that snow's falling sharp, 
I 
think of the desolate, poor Irish maiden 
Who tinkled the little Hibernian harp. 
The wind whistled, & c.

LET HIM APPLY TO ME, 
LADIES' VERSION OF " LET IIER APPLY TO ME" 
Words and Music by GEORGE W ARE. 
SOME ladies are not happy, 
When a 
husband they have got, 
But wish that they were single, 
And grumble at their lot; 
I 
really should be happy, 
If a 
husband I 
could get, 
I 
must wait a 
little longer, 
And I 
may be happy yet. 
But there, I'll keep my spirits up, 
And sing a 
cheerful song; 
I 
can't tell what may happen, 
Mr. Wright may come along. 
And if he only see's me, 
If we can agree, 
If he only has Ten Million Pounds, 
Let him apply to me. 
CHORUS. 
If the man is handsome. 
If the man is fair, 
If he's tall and winsome, 
Bright and curly hair; 
If he wants a 
loving wife, 
If we can agree, 
If he has Ten Million Pounds, 
Let him apply to me. 
Fillet him have his own way 
After I've had mine, 
He might always have a 
latch key, 
To be at home by nine. 
60 
In fact, if he behaved himself; 
I 
perhaps to him might say, 
George, go and get the Brougham 
And see me to the play. 
And, perhaps, if he was very good, 
I'd let him stay a 
bit; 
While I 
was in the boxes 
lie might go in the pit. 
Now gentlemen, here is a 
chance 
You don't meet every day; 
You've only got to raise the funds, 
I'll throw myself away. 
SPOKEN. —That is— 
If the man is, &c. 
1 
would let him run my errands, 
And take me all about, 
lie always should be master, 
The minute I 
went out. 
There, I'll let him keep my mother, 
And my father. too, as well, 
And all our poor relations 
In the house with us could dwelL 
I'd make any fellow happy, 
Only let me have my way, 
To order lots of dresses 
And Lave him the bills to pay. 
Now what could be more jolly, 
For a 
husband all his life, 
To see his cash invested, 
By me, his darling wife. 
SPOKEN.—That 
the man is, Sze.

Read what two leading New York papers say of it. 
The New 
York Evening Mail writes: 
A little book has lately appeared in rulni at Messrs. Fisher & 
Denison's, 98 Nassau street, called "The Little Flirt." We 
cannot 
say that we recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, 
as we think it would only encourage the bad lin bit of "flirting." 
Unfortunately there is enough of it done without any further neces-
sity of explaining "how, when and where to do it," and this little 
volume would advise and initiate the uncorrupted in practising what 
is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: 
We 
have lately seen a 
neat little book, bound in morooco, costing 
25 cents, called "The Little Flirt," published by Messrs. Fisher & 
Denison, 98 Nassau street. 
It gives information of the modus oper-
andi of flirting, and of the meaning of every motiou of the hand-
kerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As there is nothing at all objec-
tionable in the volume, and its contents might afford some innocertt 
amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recommend it to our 
young lady and gentlemen readers.
