Now dis ain't been de r ht time for shoo b
in' duck.  Since all
 
dein big meno come in an , buy up all us plantation, p0'  man an' ni":er
 
can't eat duck.  De white folks hab somethin' dey calls a closed-up
 
season, an' you don't know when you can eat duck an' when you can't.
 
You got to be mighty careful.  So when I hit de hill under by de town
 
an' ties up nr,r dug-out, I is a-totin' r
ay duck under my jumper.  Four
 
duck
 two brace, what would jest buy a little Christmas for dem
 
chillun, an' gib Cindy her shoe, an' fill my pipe with tobacco.  An , by
 
dat time I shot b
een ready to lipht up ra
y pipe; i
t was so cold an' de
 
wind e-blo7in'
 
ell, I brace myself aeinst de wind an' take my course where I
 
been think I could place dem duck in some buckra kitchen.  On my way
 
goin' down I meets up wid Tight Eye Swinton
 his real name been
 
John Henry, but us give that basket name to him.  He work backwards
 
an' forwards wid de sheriff.
 
I say, "Tight Eye, I got four little duck here d

de folks ain't got up yit to do house where I usually place my duck, so
 
de cook ain't take '
em.  Where can I git rid of dese  duck?"
 
An' Tight Eye say, "See dat same house yonder?"
 
An' I say, "Yass."
 
An' Tight Eye say ., "See dat tin roof?  See d

"Day is bull-necks," I say.
 
"Where you git 'em?" she say, "

An' I answer her, "Now I ain't rightly knovi.  Least I am ' L able
 
to tell you.  All I know is day is fine fat duck, an' fresh-killed.
 
Now, if I could talk to do white Missus."
 
"Well, come round to do kitchen door, an'  I
'll go in de house an'
 
find out about der

Den I ;

come an'  I '
splain how she must take dose duck to do missus.
 
She say, "Miasus in de house.  You wait awhile."  An'  she  ono in
 
de house an' take de duck wid her.
 
De next one to come been de white missus, an'  she ask,

An' den it was I see dat key.  Dat been a long key.  First jail
 
house key I ever see, an' I ain't feel no pleasure to make ac uaintanoo
 
wid it neither.  Den de door creak, an' I feel I got to explain b

I is shut up for good an' de Sheriff gone on.  So I bust out,
 
"Dat feller, Tight Eye sent me dare,  Mr. Bullintine.  I ain'

 You know me.  You kn o

An' dere I

lighted fire.  Plenty of fire woud.  Dat one thLng don't cost us nothin'
 
but hard work.  I know Joy wasn't hungry.  Flenty of  o
tato for roast.
 
But where they papa been?  I can hear de littlest boy, little Mike1 a-
cryin' for he daddy.  An , I c

"Yo' papa can take care of hisseif.  Ain't nothin' big enough to

An' I think about how little Mike fears them river varmint.  He
 
was allus talkin' about do '

know dem rice-field been full of bogs.  Den too, a woman is powerful
 
funny sometimes.  If a man don't turn up dey all time '
spicion s

?  I  reckon Cindy'll be sayin' to herself, "I'm feared Hike musta  ot
 
in trouble."  An' if she think dat, dis been one time when she think
 
what so.
 
At suDper t

'
em is jest as happy as if dey was walkin' out on do street.  Dey been
 
dore too much.  Used to it.  But I ain't never seen de jail insides
 
before.  An' de Sheriff, he know dis, an' he know me, so he say,
 
"
Like, I gwino give you a good supper.  Set right down in dat

PRAMKIE AND JOHNNIE
 
Sometime between 1849 and 1890 a sporting woman, probably
 
named Frankie, shot or stabbed to death her fancy man, named Albert
 
or Johnnie, having found him in flagrante deliotu with a woman named
 
Alice Fly, Alice B]
.y, Alice Swan, Nellie Bly, Katie Fly, Ella Pry,
 
Sara Su es or, most improbably, Alkali.  According to one well-
documented account, probably too well documented to be seriously re-
garded, the famous lady, one Frankie Baker, still lives in Portland,
 
Oregon.  The St. Louis Post Dispatch of October 20, 1899 carried a
 
news story which connects this living and real Frankie Baker with the
 
incident and the ballad that runs in part:
 
"Allen Britt's brief experience in the art of love cost him his
 
life.  He died at the City Hospital Wednesday night from knife
 
wounds inflicted by Frankie Baker, an ebony-hued cake-walker.
 
Britt was also colored.  He was seventeen years old.  He met
 
Frankie at the Orange Blossom's ball and was smitten with her.
 
Frankie reciprocated and invited him to call upon her.  There-
after they were lovers.
 
"In the rear of 212 Targee St. lived Britt.  There his sweetheart
 
wended her way a few nights ago and lectured Britt for his
 
alleged duplicity.  Allen's reply was not intended to cheer the
 
dusky damsel and a glint of steel gleamed in the darkness.  An
 
instant later the boy fell mortally wounded.  Frankie Baker is
 
locked up at the police force courts."
 
There are thousands of negro women named or nicknamed Frankie;
 and
 
there have been many killings for love.  Of the sixty-nine murders
 
a
z
tiong negroes in Dallas, Texas for 1944, only nineteen of the murderers
 
being brought up for trial s
 j ealoUsy q according to police records,
 
was at the bottom of nearly all the trouble, a pistol, not a knife or
 
razor, the instrument of the victims' taking off.  Recently the ice
 
pick has become the lethal weapon.  Over and over again in the
 
different current versions of Frankie and Johnnie (Robert Gordon
 
collected more than 300 for the Library of Congress), the murder weapon
 
was a pistol;  there was the nervous bartender who told Frankie what
 
was going on, there was the meeting with the mother and a big funeral.
 
.2..
 
The Post Dispatch story is probably not the basis for the
 
Prankie and
. Johnnie ballad.  Emerson Hough heard the song in St. Louis
 
before 1850.  Many informants are yet alive who have known it long
 
before 1890.  To add to confusion a woman calling herself Prankie Baker
 
from Oregon come to St. Louis two years ago and prosecuted a suit for
 
slander against those she thought had defamed hen
 
The tragedy of the jealous sporting woman who dropped her man
 
Cljke a hunter dropped a bird has become an American classic.  Mae West
 
has made it her very own on the stage and in the movies.  30e Cook
 
and many another American have crooned it, slap-
.aticked it, and sung
 
it for thous ands of audiences.  Negro honky-tonk piano players,
 
soldiers in fox holes and Americans of all varieties have intoned it
 
like an American litany.
 It might be well to remember that the ballad
 
is no more brutal, and it is less bloody7 than certain British ballads
 
held in memory for some hundreds of years.
 
FRAIKIE AyjD JOHNNIE 
Frankie was a good woman, everybody knows,
 
she spent a hundred dollars for to buy her man some clothes.
 
Oh, he was her man, but he done her wrong.
 
Frankie went down to the corner, went there with a can,
 
Ast the lovin' bartender: "Has you seen my lovin' man?--
He's my man but he's doin' me wrong**
 
Frankie went down to the whore-house, rang the whore-house bell;
 
Says, "Tell me is my lovin' Johnnie here? Caze Prankle's gwine to/
 
Oh, he's my man but he's doint me wrong."
 /raise some hell
 
Frankie went down to the corner, didn't go there for fun;
 
Underneath her raglin she had Johnnie's Forty-One.. 
He was her man, but she shot him down.
 
When Johnnie saw Frankie, for the back door he did scoot,
 
But Frankie pulled that Forty-f
 0 , went root ta toot-toot-ta-toot-/
 
An' she shot him down; yes, she shot him down.
 /too
 
Well, when Frankie shot Johnnie, he fell down on his knees,
 
Looked up at her and said, "Oh, Frankie, please
 
Don't shoot me no mot s babe, don't shoot me no mo'".
 
"Oh, turn me over, doctor, turn me over slow,
 
Turn me over on my right side, oaze the bullet is a-hurtin' me so."
 
He was her man, but he's dead an' gone.
 
Frankie followed Johnnie to the graveyard, fell down on her knees.
 
"Speak one word, Johnnie, an' give my heart some ease. 
You was my man, but you done me wrong."
 
Johnnie raise up in his grave, to old Frankie he said,
 
"You bein' my lovin' woman, kindly put some cracked ice on my head-
I was yo' man, but I done you wrong."
 
An' now jt
g rubber-tired carriages, an' a rubber-tired hack,
 
Took old Johnnie to the graveyard an' brought his mother back--
His soul's in hell, his soul's in hell.

American  Ballads and Polk Songs

iokln Henry 
L
ate in May l9.9, just about "
fu t dark", we drove into Cummins State Lonv ct
 
Farm, near
 Bluff,Arkansas. With our recording mathine frow the Library ox uon-
gress we h
ead come on a second visit to this camp in search of more songs from the
 
Negro convicts. After a bountiful supper at Camp Five headquarters with the family
 
of CaptairAllen, a former Texan, we adjourned to the Negro barracks, where by the aid
 
of kerosene lamps and flash lights we set up our recording machine. Through thv bars
 
Mr.Lomax explained to the "boys" just
 kinds of songs he wished to record. One boy
 
volunteered a child's song  and a field holler. After  the recordings of these songs
 
were played back, other boys crowded up to the bars to offer their songs, mostly blues,
 
or "sorrow s
ongs", as one boy called them, and spirituals. The Captain generously
 
allowed us to stay p
ast t
ke nine o'clock "lights out" since the morrow was  Sunday;
 
but the lnpa were burning low, and we were packing up when a big fellow ventured:
 
"I don't reckon you'd want 'John Henry', would you? I guess you already got that."

he d-rider he was allowed to carry in the field. Fe tried it ot on tne barracks
 
bars, nodded and at the signal "Ready'.", started in again and sang through nine
 
stanzas, besting time with his billy against the iron bars.  His tune was different
 
fro  the oth r forty a
id more versions in the Archive of American Folk Song.
 
cily a few days after we  ade thip visit to Cummins S
tate Farm a storm blew down
 
the barrac)s of C
amp Five. We hadn't t  heart to enquire whether Arthur Bell was among
 
those killed in the s
torm. Perhaps he i8
till singing his '

somewhere out inthe "free world."

JoLn Henry
 
In all probability the J
ohn Henry ballad origiu ted in the V
,
'est Virgita
 
mountain c
ountry s perhaps as early as 1870. There the business of the stetl-drive,
-
.
 
was to drill holes in the s
olid rock for powder charges to blast out tu
la through
 
the mountains.
 Mn=  John Henry with his nine-pound hemmer challenged the steam-driven
 
drill. In the '
best and Southwest, and especially in Lousiana where Arthur Bell's
 
John
 He r 
r
i lived, there were no mountains to tunnel through, and there  John Henry
 was  
-  
"transferred" to the s
ection g&ng amd
 became champion at lining track and tamping ties.
 
But in  ll parts of the country Johf
l Henry is the superstrong man
., the work champion,
 
defying  the machine, whether steam drill or steam engine pulling it, heavy load on
 
tae track, to outdo him in feats of s
trength.

RYE WHISKEY
 
Among the drinking songs current on the Texas frontier when
 
I was a boy, was a ditty that told the story of a young couple who
 
liked to live by themselves,
 
She loved gin and I loved rum,
 
Didn't we have a lot of fun
 
When he needed a stimulant he turned up "The Little Brown Jug".
 
What his wife drank from the song doe
s
n't say.  Perhaps they poured
 
the gin and rum together and both drank the mixture.  Many years
 
later I first saw t
he song in print and discovered it to be a music
 
hail composition.
 
Equally popular in Texas was anothe-r drinking song singing
 
the praises of rye whiskey.
 I have never learned how this song got
 
started though it seems fairly certain that many different "
songsters"
 
contributed stanzas.  Dr. Louise Pound of the University of Nebraska
 
doesn't believe in the theory advanced by Professors Guinmere and
 
Kittredge that folk songs may have been originated by groups of
 
singers rather than by a single person.  To me one fact seems certain:
 
The words of "Rye Whiskey" (I have many stanzas from many sources)
 
were not composed by a single person.  The song got started some way,
 
somehow, and is still growing.
 
In addition to providing entertainment for a lone ricer
 
scouting for cattle or riding the "line" to turn back drifting steers,
 
I have heard the song used by groups of young people where the sinful
 
fiddle was barred.  Sung to a slow beat, the tune is admirable for the
 
old time slow waltz.  Sing "Rye Whiskey" for us, a d a
ring couple
 
would beg the crowd gathered in a Baptist-Methodist dominated frontier
 
community.  Then two young souls, unafraid of the edicts of the Church,
 
upheld by the music of a group of envious friends, would swing away

In Florida the State Penitentiary is located at Laifora -
-
 n
ot a city, t
own
 
or even a village, but a mere wide cleared spot in the barren, piney woods uplan'
 
district near the north boundary of the State.  All the State convicts, including
 
the women, except a

residence at Raifora

inside the high walls that inclose the entire peruterit
ry.  I went one su n€r n
i
t
 
to hear them sing and to record the beat of their spirituals.  At the time Iron He
,
 
a Texas convict paroled in my charge, travelled with me.  He sang sample songs to
 
illustrate what I wished to record from Negro songsters and proved himself a usefoi
 
assistant.  In his honor the girls -
-
 al
l mu dere s nd few over twenty years old
 
were dressed out in their hri htest Sund r finery.  They v
;o ked thr )
ubhout the day
 
as seamstresses.
 
In behind the big dormitory lay a pile of freshly cut pine logs n
ear which I
 
set up the recording machine while my audience and s
ingers, like a flock of birds,
 
festooned themselves on and about the heap of logs.  A full moon was shining.  The
 
curious young women chattered as they waited and ogled the not too reluctant Iron
 
Head.  When the singers -
 singly, in duets and quartettes -
 began the program
 
under the open sky in the stilly n
ight while a soft breeze sweetened the air, I
 
found myself stirred deeply by their fresh young voices.  The group of young i
;
o rn
 
listened with breathless attention.  Even the grim-faced Iron Head became less
 
officious in trying to take over my job as the s
ongs rong out in the quiet of the
 
night
 
The climax came when a quartette of the youngest convicts sang "Sometines I
 
Feels Like a Motherless Child .  The leader sang a pure, very high soprano and the
 
four voices blended perfectly.  At the close, the leader, a graceful young girl,
 
was so moved that she ran away to the rear of the enclosed yard waving her arms in
 
deep distress, and crying, "
1 want to go home
 I want to go home!"

THE hOUr ISu
. HL E
NE
 
Not many wardens of Southern Penitentiaries welcomed me when I came looking
 
for folk songs among Negro convicts.  Their reception was even more chilly when
 
they saw the ex-convict, Lead Belly, at the wheel of my automobile -
-
 a skillful
 
driver, and, in connection with his twelve-string guitar, a marvellous stirrer-
up of interest among singing convicts
 At Camp Number 5 of the Arkansas Peni-
tentiary, however, I found an ex-Texan in charge who received me cordially.
 
One may decry it as he pleases but there is a special fraternity among Texans.
 
The "Captain", as he is called, heard my strange story and at once crawled
 
into my automobile and directed Lead Belly to d
rive fi  out  in the fields whs e
 
a group of Negroes were picking cotton.  He sLoite3 t
o the "
rider", the trusty
 
on horseback, to bring the bunch of cotton pickers over to the turn-row.  Toe
 
men grouped themselves about the car and sang song after song, s
pirituals and
 
"sinful songs", geared to the rhyth  of swiftly moving hands snatching cott n
 
from the boils and stuffing it into s
acks swinging at their sides.  Under the
 
spirited leadership of a tall black man, Kelley Pace, the s
on s s
eeaed beauti-
ful and powerful.  Many of them were strange to me.
 
The warden seemed pleased at my satisfaction, invited me to stay in his
 
home (
I was thirty miles from a hotel), and turned Lead Belly over to a host
 
who could speak his language, the trusty convict head-rider.  After supper that
 
night my venture met disaster:  the recording machine broke down during the
 
first song.  The next day Lead Be l
ly drove me sixty dies t
o Pine Bluff over
 
the worst roads in Arkansas to have the n
achine repaired.  Again on our return
 
two hundred Negro convicts eagerly waited, and again the machine broke down
 
into rasping scrapings that made the convicts giggle.  The next day another
 
sixty mile trip and a return to the camp in the middle of the afternoon.  The
 
Texan warden told me (
I had evidently worn out my welcome): "
I'll send for the
 
r p
-
r
i
en one nDre  t
ime.  We can't keep on running a penitentiary for a ballad hunter.
 
This is your last chance."
 
J few moments later I saw a group of convicts swing around a bend in the
 
rad that led from the fields, running at t
op speed and shouting, "We want to
 
g
it )f
l dat machines"  Behind them galloped the head-rider, with shot-gun pointing
 
owIJ, braced against the pommel of his saddle.  I had set up the recording

Eight sang and one whistled like a locomotive.  A listener feels the rapid

The t

glee.  One man exclaimed as be slapped h
is leader's back, "
Old Kelley Pace put
 
it over that time, didn't he?"  And the locomotive whistler, thinking of a

ALL THE PRETTY LITTLE HORSES
 
" Shirley Lomax Mansell, who writes the following note, not
 
only speaks for herself here, but for practically every other
 
Southern girl who has ever been rocked to sleep or who has ever
 
sung to her own babies.  For "All the Pretty Little Horses" can be
 
found in the repertoire of every southern family, Negro and white;
 
it is the classic of southern lullabies.
 It is sung in a thousand
 
different ways by as many singers;
 the "pretty little horses" may
 
be "blacks and bays" or "dapples and greys" but, whatever their color,
 
they have carried almost every southern child off to sleep at one
 
time or another.  Here is what Shirley says about the way the song
 
was sung in our family:
 
All the Pretty Little Horsee
is a family sons.  There is
 
not a time when I do not remember it.
 I am sure it was Grandmother
 
Brown's song;  from our mother it now belongs to her four children.
 
Grandmother did not often sing anything but hymns, and those mostly
 
on Sunday afternoons when she rocked back and forth in her little
 
straight, cane-bottomed rocker, alone in her room.  Grandmother did
 
not believe that on Sunday people should do anything but attend
 
Sunday School, then church, then read the Bible until time to go to
 
evening services.  Her disapproval of our Sunday afternoon walks,
 
when the children from all the neighborhood gathered to explore the
 
woods, or  '
walk through to the Dame, caused her to shut herself into
 
her room and rock and sing, and I am sure, pray for forgiveness for
 
us all.  Her lips would shut into a thin line, and her eyes fill with
 
tears.

But Grandmother Brown loved babies, and she sang to us all,
 
and rocked us, hours and hours, in that same little chair.
 WAll the
 
Pretty Little Horeea
is a wonderful lullaby.  The phrases can be
 
a4
 
changed, a line or two of hums can be put in instead of the words At
 
wj .j and the baby drifts off into sleep, Yloating with the little
 
horses the song blends with the squeak of the rocker/ and the pat of
 
the foot on the rug.  The horrible verse about the '
!bees and the
 
butterflies  was not sung in our house, and should never be used---
what baby could sleep with such a pitiful and ghastly picture stamped
 
into his dreamy little soul?  I still sing it to my girls when they
 
are ill, but they always request that that verse not be sung.
 And I
 
don't blame them* /

THE BUFFALO SKINNERS
 
Back in the
 
days just after the Civil War,
 
i itera used to go out on the
 
#lains in wagon trains and kill buffalo for their hides.  The stark-
naked, ghastly-looking bodies were left lying on the plains and down
 
along the ravines to rot or to furnish food for wolves and buzzards.
 
My Uncle Charlie Cooper killed as many as seventy-five a day with his
 
famous Needle gun.  The hides were hauled to the nearest railroad and
 
from there shipped East where the skin side was tanned and softened,
 
while the "warm side, fur aide, outside" was left untouched.  The fur
 
was long, soft, shiny, of all shades from light brown to deep black.
 
Big buffalo-bull fur was often jet black at certain seasons of the
 
year.
 
The first hunters were glad to get a dollar for one undressed
 
hide.  Years later a fine dressed buffalo hide sold for one hundred
 
dollars, buffalo overcoats up to  25O.00.  These buffalo hides, pro-
perly tanned, made beautiful rugs and were also often out and fashioned
 
into cloaks for fair ladies.  The Indians likewise wore them thrown
 
over their shoulders, and one a*mo sometimes f4and Vho m used as floor
 
covering in their teepees.
 
J,.
 Te old Abilene man  ad been a sharpshooter in his younger
 
days.  He carried a Needle gun and killed the buffalo for the entire
 
hunting party.  The Indians said of another buffalo gun, the Sharpø
 
rifle, "It shoots today and kills tomorrow."  While some of the gang
 
skinned the dead animals and spread the skins out to dry, the others
 
packed the hides and loaded them into the wagons.
 "Two to shoot,
 
four to akin, one to cook," says an old chronicle.  Long years after-
wards Charles Goodnight, a noted Texas cattleman, raised buffalo for
 
-2-
food.  He is said to have soil a single carcass for  3bO.00.  The
 
cross breeds were called cattle9,,
 
-7 -
y�*rs-
-afteTri
icd ther men came through the same territory
 
with other wagons, and collected the bones of the buffalo, bleached
 
white by wind and rain and years of sunshine.  They made more money
 
selling these bones for fertilizers than had been obtained from the
 
hides. 5?In
 their migrations from North to South buffalo moved in
 
enormous herds.  Reaching the swift flowing Arkansas river, legends
 
say, the millions of beasts drank the river dry.
 "For five days,"
 
says a frontiersman, "we had ridden through and camped in a mobile
 
sea of buffalo."  Another traveller says, "For seven miles from the
 
Arkansas River back to the foothills was a living mass of buffalo,
 
pressing in countless thousands upon each other, a migration of
 
millions of prime animals--no young or old--from the Indian Territory
 
to the Hudson Bay basin where the winter killed many."
 
The old hunter went on to tell the story of a group of
 
buffalo hunters that he had led from .
3aokeboro, Texas, to
 t-i
'e
on
 
the Pease River- ' 
hunt lasted for several
 
months.  The plains were dry and parched.  The party fought sandstorms,
 
flies, mosquitoes, bedbugs, and wolves.  Even the Indians watched to
 
pick them off from near-by Mexico.  At the close of the season, the
 
manager of the outfit, who had been hauling the hides to the nearest
 
market, announced to the men as they broke camp for the trip home that
 
he had lost money on the enterprise and could not pay them any wages.
 
They argued the question with him.
 
"So," the cV man told me,
 
"we shot down old Crego, the
 
manager, and left his damn ol' bones to bleach where we had left
 
many hundreds of stinking buffalo.  It took us many days to get back
 
to 3acksboro.  As we sat around the camp fire at night, one of the
 
-3-
boys started up a song about our hunt and the hard times and old
 
Crego.
 And we all set in to help him.  Before we got to Jacksboro
 
we shaped it up and our whole crowd would sing it together."
 
sk4acers.
,.P  This song, declared Professor George Lyman Kittredge of
 
Harvard, the great American ballad authority, is the beet singing
 
ballad contained in Cowboy Songs. 
i- o1-4iim
 From twenty-one separate versions and eleven stanzas
 
I put together the stanzas quoted:
 
Come, all you jolly fellows and listen to
 
my song,
 
There are not many verses, it will not
 
detain you long;
 
It's concerning some young fellows who did
 
agree to go
 
And spend one summer pleasantly on the
 
range of the buffalo.
 
It happened in Jackeboro in the spring of
 
'
73,
 
A man by the n a
me of Crego came step-
ping up to me,
 
Saying, "How do: you do, young fellow,
 
and how would you like to go,
 
And spend one summer pleasantly on the range of the
 
buffalo?"
 
"
It's me being out of employment," this to
 
Crego I did say,
 
"This going out on the buffalo r ange  depends
 
upon the pay.
 
But if you will pay good wages, give transportation,
 
too,
 
I think, sir, I will go with you to the range of
 
the buffalo."
 
It's now we've crossed Pease River, our
 
troubles have begun,
 
The first damned tail I went to rip.  Ouohl
 
bow I cut my thumbl
 
While skinning the damned old stinkers,
 
our lives they had no show,
 
For the Indians watched to pick us off,
 
while skinning the buffalo.
 
' p 
-4-
Our hearts were cased with buffalo hocks,
 
our souls were cased with steel,
 
And the hardships of that summer would nearly make
 
us reel.
 
While skinning the damned old stinkers,
 
our lives they had no show,
 
For the Indians waited to pick us off on
 
the hills of Mexico.
 
The season being near over, old Crego he
 
did say
 
The crowd had been extravagant, was in
 
debt to him that day.
 
We coaxed his and we begged him, but
 
still it was no go--
e left old Crego's bones to bleach on the
 
range of the buffalo.
 
Oh, it's now we've crossed Pease River
 
and homeward we are bound,
 
No more in that hell-fired country shall
 
ever we be found.
 
Go home to our wives and sweethearts, tell
 
others not to go,
 
For God's forsaken the buffalo range and
 
the d a
mned old buffalo.

HILE prosaic souls may be d

Nor will any thoughtful s
