PREFACE. 
All the songs in .his book are sung in connection with CHAS. M AC 
EVOY'S ORIGINAL " ilIBERNICON." 
This exhibition, as the name im-
plies, has reference to Ireland ; and is, in fact, a panorama of Irish 
scenery, and with its many adjuncts, illustrates the scenery, music, 
and antiquities of Ireland. 
It was the first exhibition of the kind ever presented to an Ameri-
can audience, and was gotten up with great care,after years of mature 
study and deliberation. 
The sketches, engravings and photographs were imported from 
Loudon and Dublin, expressly for the work, and executed on canvas, 
at a 
vast outlay, by the celebrated French Scenic Artists, MM. Du-
flocq & Fouchere, of the Grand Opera House, Paris. 
Many of the " Historical Pictures," added to the series from time 
to time are from the pencils of the best European Artists. 
To give vitallity to the exhibition and render it acceptable to all 
classes, both young and old, a " Dramatic Episode," written expressly 
for it, and entitled " Irish Hearts, or, Love in the Ould Sod," is per-
formed in connection with the panoramic views as they pass before 
the spectator—introducing, also, appropriate, patriotic, sentimental 
and comic songs, many ot them original, and nearly all of which will 
be found in this collection. 
These adjuncts to the paintings, improved upon by many years of 
experience, have proved to be an important element in the success of 
the Original " Hibernicon." 
To produce a 
refined Irish entertainment of this style, of only two 
hours duration, and give in that short time glances at the most 
beautiful scenery of the - Emerald Isle," reminiscences of her glorious 
past history, together with life- like sketches of the grave and humor-
ous sides of the character of her extraordinary people, is no small 
task. 
Yet, all these things have been successfully accomplished in the 
" 
Hibernicon," and from its first exhibition in 1860, to the present 
time, has delighted hundreds of thousands of people, and received the 
highest encomiums of the entire press of the United States and 
Canada. 
Its extraordinary success since the " Inaugural Exhibition" given 
in New York, in 1860, has recently induced tinprincipl d speculators 
to imitate it. 
And, although the title, episode, and other accessories 
are protected by the latest " copyright" laws, 
these miserable 
"Frauds" usurp the legal rights of the proprietor under cover of 
mere technicalities, palm off their miserable daubs and piagiarisms on 
the public as the genuine article. 
Hence the word " Original" is 
used to distinguish it from the many counterfeits now traveling 
through the country,

FAMOUS ORIGINAL ' HIBERNICON! 
Mac Evoy's " Hibernicon."—This entertainment is decidedly one 
of the finest ot the kind ever exhib-ted in NtINY York.—Donocrat. 
Aug. 9, 186e, 
Mr. MacEvoy's " Hibernicon" proved exceedingly pleasing to its 
auditors. 
It is a careful y 
painted and strongly meritorious pano-
rama, which in the presentation is illustrated by speech and by song 
—New York Dibune, Sep. 29, leGS. 
Whoever wttnessos it once will not fail to go again, and bring their 
friends.— Irish People, Oct. 3, 1868. 
It has suddenly made a 
dive into public favor, and from present 
indication it will stick there interminably, historically, musically, 
poetically, sentimentally. comically and pictorially, it forms a 
diver. 
sion that young and old both profit by.— New York courier, Sept. 27, 
1868. 
As we predicted a f
,w weelts ag 
this exhibition has proved a 
dec kl ed 
saccess.—Nete York 'Jerald, Sept. 1568 . 
MacEvoy's " Hibernicon" is 
exceedingly well patronized—Rog.er 
Williams' Hall being niehtly nearly lull—a success which is no more 
than the very : treat ant diversified attractions of the entertainment 
richly merit.—Providenee ( 11.1.) Journal, April 7, 1669. 
Chas MacEvoy's " Hibernicon."—The institute was again filled in 
ev-ry part last night, by an aneience who appeared to be highly 
delighted vita the whele performance. 
Indeed, they could not be 
otherwise for from whttever point it might be regarded " excellent" 
is the word that many:WY arises to express the degree of merit with 
which it is viewed.— St. John N. B.) Daily .31-orntng News, May 21.1569. 
No better evidence rail be given of " love of country" than is 
a 
fforde I 
in the triumphant snecees of MacEvey's " Ilibernicon." 
Tiis beautiful panorama has be n 
unrolled eieeitly at the Academy

Just at 9 o'cleck, a

offered for st inditere.00m. 
The entleeeesei of the audieuce seems to

The panoramic effeets were unusually fine, and the illnsions of per-
spective at times quite stariline.

EXTRACTS, &C. [CONCLUDED. 
We really do not remember when we have been more charmed than 
by the " lithernicon" last night, at Alae ,nic Temple. It is a grand 
panorama of " ould Ireland," the blessed land of song and scenery, of 
wits and poets. orators. statesmen and heroes, who stand unrivaled. 
Louisvile (liy.)Sun, Dec. 7, 1869. 
For the first time we were a 
spectator from beginning to end, last 
evening, 
at MacEvoy's Original " Hibernicon" ou exhibition at 
Masonic Hall— his panorama is unexceptionably, in artistic execution 
and the variety of scenery pictured the most attrac ism that has ever 
been untolded in Nev Orleans.—New Orleans Commercial Bnlletin, 
..faa. -2.), 187J. 
To say that the " flit ernicon" is a 
grand success does not express 
the whole truth. 
The scenery and music is of the highest order. 
The tour through Ireland wiil well repay any one without the fine 
!timer., or the side-eplittine, Inn-provoking utterances of " Barney 
the Guide."—Daily Constitution, Mobile, Ala. Feb. 18, 1570. 
MacEvoy's Original " Hibernicon."—We are glad to perceive that 
this entertainment is receiving the patronage which its merits so 
richly deserve 
The panorama itself is a 
faithful delineation of that 
unequalled natural scenery which has made Ireland famous the world 
over.— St. Louie ( Mo.) Republican, Nov. 169. 
In days like these so replete with advertised humbnes, it is truly 
pleasing elien one wishes to spend an hour in some profoundly in-
tellectual amusement, not to find oneself duped anew. Such indeed 
were our felings, when lately in company with some friends we 
enjoyed the eumberless seenie beauties of the celebrated MacEvoy's 
" 
Ilibernieon.—.St. Louis nines, Nov. 18, 1569. 
The exhibition is rather en .que, being a 
Panoramic View of a 
jour-
ney thomeh Ireland ; being teal in so much as the genuine Irish 
Gulde, whose odd sayines and witticisms are calculated to make a 
wooden man laugh. 
The views are fine and well put up, and the ex-
hibition is Well worth the attendance of all who wish to combine 
amusement and instruction.— Indianapolis ( Ind.) Sentinel, Nov. 30, 
1569. 
Chas. MacEvoy's " Hibernicon" still continnes to draw large crowds 
of delighted visitors. 
The enteetainmenr consists of a 
Panorama in 
five parts, giving views of all the chief objects of interest in Ireland. 
It is well executed, alit from the delighted ejaculatious of various 
auditors we judge the views are accurate. 
A sort of running accom-
paniment is given in thejovs and s,rrows of " Berney the guide," and

Music by J. G. MAEDER. 
Oh a 
blessing fall upon thee now, 
My dear old isle, 
Tho' in grief aiul care thy children bow, 
My dear old isle. 
While far away beyond the sea, 
In pleasant dreams I 
visit thee, 
And best of lauds thou art to me. 
My dear old isle. 
It's a 
blessing on thy pretty girls, 
.my dear old isle, 
For of womankind they are the pearls, 
My dear old isle. 
Their lips are sweet as morning dew, 
Their loving hearts are warm and true, 
The fairest girls I 
ever knew, 
My dear old isle. 
Should a 
roving heart thy sod forget, 
My dear old isle, 
May a 
clond upon his way be set, 
:\ly dear old isle. 
The storms that fold thy hills to-day, 
Shall melt in tranquil suns away, 
So blessings on thee now we pray, 
My dear old isle.

How they nursed me with joy ; said : what a 
fine boy! 
Put a 
stick in my fist, by the way of a 
toy; 
Faith! there's no mistake, they admired my make, 
And said some day rd give the girls a 
warming. 
CHORUS.. 
For, Paddy is the boy that's fond of a 
glass, 
Paddy is the boy that's fond of a 
lass! 
Dear Old Dublin is the place for me, 
And Donnybrook is the place to go for a 
spree, 
At a 
wake or a 
fair, poor Paddy is there; 
He will fight foe or friend, if they do him offend; 
Let the piper strike up, he will rise from his cup, 
With a 
smile on his face adorning. 
With his little Colleen, he'll dance on the green, 
Sure, an Irishman, there, in his glory was seen 
Play a 
reel or jig, he don't care a 
fig 
But he'll dance till day-light, in the morning. 
For, Paddy is the boy, cto 
Now boys, do you mind; you never will find, 
Such a 
dear little place as the Emerald Isle; 
Long, long, may it stand, and good luck to the land, 
That dear Old St. Patrick was born in! 
May the girls, young and old, may the boys, brave and bold 
Cnite, heart and hand, to protect the dear Isle ! 
And, morn. noun and night, may joy and delight 
&due on them, like a 
fine Summer's morning. 
For, Paddy is the boy, ite.

KATE O'CONNOR. 
(Recitation) 
Written for the Original " Ifibernicon" by H UGH ROBINS3N, San Fran• 
else°, Cal. 
Up from a 
valley where beauty's smile, 
in that gem of the ocean, the Emerald Isle, 
The clustered spires of Conamara stand, 
Green- walled by the hills of Ireland. 
Fields of grain o'er the valley sweep. 
And honest toilers everywhere you meet ; 
It was years ago, in ninety-eight. 
When the world wept for poor Emmett's fate. 
When guilty Morbury from vengeance fled, 
Fitzgerald fought and glorious Wolfe Tone bled; 
When an aged hand struck for Ireland's weal, 
And flashed in defiance her native steel. 
Kate O'Connor four-score years and ten, 
Waved the Emerald banner in the lion's den ; 
Bravest of all when the Red Coats came, 
And the men stood back with a 
blush of shame. 
She nobly stood in her cottage door ; 
Write on her tomb " true to the core ;" 
Up the street came the soldiers' tread, 
With a 
scion of Britain riding at their head. 
From under his plume of red and white. 
He glanced, and the flag of Erin met his sight ; 
Halt! 
Each one holds his breath, 
And awaits the order that sends withering death 
To the noble soul in the cottage door, 
With the waving gem of the shamrock shore. 
[
11 
KATE O'CONNOR,—[CoNcLunEn. 
Fire—ontblazed the leaden blast, 
It rent the banner from her feeb:e grasp. 
But ere it reached its native soil 
Kate O'Connor, who did not recoil, 
Raised it up with a 
loyal will, 
And spoke in tones that were clear and shrill, 
" 
Shoot if you will this ol3 grey head ; 
This: flag don't fall until I 
am dead." 
A shade of sadness and a 
blush of shame, 
Over the face of the Briton came. 
The very soldiers gave a 
heartfelt sigh, 
When they saw their bullets had passed her by. 
The leader turned and in a 
quiet tone 
Bade his soldiers to go marching on. 
The soldiers passed, and that green flag tossed, 
Over the head of King George's host. 
And ever its green folds rose and fell 
Over the head of her who loved it well. 
Kate O'Connor's work is o'er, 
And Britain's leader is no more. 
Honor to her: and o'er her grave 
That flag triumphant yet shall N 
When the cry " to arms." comes for Erin's weal, 
Midst the thunder of cannon and clash of steel. 
Her spirit will hover o'er the fight, 
Blessing those who strike for Ireland's right. 
And when Erin's struggle is at hand 
Thousands will flock from every land. 
Heroes will rise on every shore. 
And swear Erin's Isle free for evermore.

THE TAIL IV MY COAT. 
Ever gliding through my slumbers 
Softly flitting o'er my dreams, 
Weaving spells around my numbers, 
From the music of thy streams. 
He that placed the stars above thee 
In that spacious azure dome, 
Only knows how much I 
love thee, 
My own queenly island home, 
Only knows how much I 
7ove thee, 
My own queenly island home. 
Through the veil that shrouds thy story, 
In my visions I 
can see 
Fairy gleamings of the glory 
That so long o'er-shadowed thee; 
Still its rays come flashing o'er me, 
For no matter where I 
roam 
Thou art evermore before me, 
My own queenly island home, 
Thou art evermore before me, 
My own queenly island home. 
Pure and lovely I 
behold thee, 
As thou wert in days of yore, 
Ere the traitor knaves had sold thee, 
And thy fruitful vales mastore, 
When the sun-burst flashed above thee, 
On each castle tow r 
and dome, 
When it was no crime to love thee, 
My own queenly island home, 
When it was no crime to love thee, 
My own queenly island home.

From the big town of Limerick lately I 
came, 
I 
left Ireland solely bekase of my name, 
For if anything whit wrong, or a

Shure they'd have all the olame on my mother's own boa. 
So my name now is Paddy O'Connor, 
'Pon an Irishman's throe word and honor, 
Oh, mist-hi-time my cam so light upon he:, 
'Twas she christened me Paddy Milos. 
If a 
windy was broke, or a 
house robbed of tiles, 
And you'd ax who done that, share they'd say Paddy Miles 5 
Who was it set fire to his reverence's wfg, 
And cut the tail of Pat Flanigan's pig. 
Who called Mtshes Mtdoney a 
scollop, 
And gave Biddy McGee's eat the jallop, 
Sonic blackguards would hit me a 
wollop, 
And say it was you, Paddy Miles. 
I 
worked in the bogs and behaved, as I 
thought, 
From my master Mick Flynn. is character brought, 
But it done me no good, and I, thought that was odd, 
So I 
made up my mind for to fea-a the oak! sod. 
For the devil a

The girls there they would Autti:,3 - me, 
They threatened at once to dest7oy 1/

And who broke the left horn of Ned S'houg,hnessy's goat,. 
Who through the back door to the chapcl gct ia, 
And drank all the wine, blood and ounds what a 
sin, 
Who half- murdered a 
poor-house inspecto!, 
And fired at a 
police detector, 
When Miss Fagan they tried to eject her, 
Who was it, but you, Paddy Miles. 
I 
trotted to Dublin to look for a

Tho' they'd ne'er saw me there, faix, they all kiso.e. eiti '346 
The jackeens kept calling myself to annoy, 
There's goes Paddy Miles he's a

Till I 
flourish my sprig 0;' shillalah, 
An' smattered their gobs so genteelly. 
When the blood it began to flow free)y, 
Said I, how do you like Paddy Miles. 
In short, before long to this country I 
came, 
An' found Paddy Milts here was the same ; 
If my name v.-asn't changed I 
was likely to starve, 
For bad luck to the Plaster could I 
sarve. 
So Paddy O'Connor it is made. sir,

Be my soul then you need not be afraid, sir, 
For to hire ins, rna not Paddy Miles. 
WE HAVE LIVED AND LOVED TOGETHER. 
We have lived and loved together, 
Through many changing years; 
We have shared each other's gladness, 
And wept each other's tears. 
I 
have never known a 
sorrow 
That was long unsoothed by thee, 
Th it was long unsoothed by thee: 
For thy smile can make a 
summer, 
Where darkness else would be. 
Like the leaves that fall around us, 
In Autumn's fading hours, 
Are the traitor smiles that darken, 
When the cloud of sorrow lowers ; 
And though many such we've known, love, 
Too prone, alas ! to range, 
Too prone, alas! to range, 
We both can speak of one, love, 
Whom time cottd never change.

GOOD-BYE, SWEETHEART, GOOD-BYE. 
The bright stars fade, the morn is breaking, 
The dew-drops pearl each bud and leaf, 
And I 
from thee my leave am taking 
With bliss too brief, 
With bliss, with bliss too brief. 
How sinks my heart with fond alarms, 
The tear is hiding in mine eye : 
For, time cloth thrust me from thine arms: 
Good-bye, sweetheart, good-bye! 
Good-bye, sweet-heart, good-bye! 
For, time doth thrust me from thine arms, 
Good-bye, sweetheart, good-bye 1 
The sun is up, the lark is soaring., 
Loud swells the song of chanticleer: 
The leviet bounds o'er earth's soft flooring, 
'Yet I

Yet I 
am here, yet I 
am here. 
For, since night's gems from heaven did fade 
And morn to floral lips cloth hie, 
I 
could not leave thee, though I

THE BRIGADE AT FONTENOY. 
nth May, 1745.) ( By BARTHOLOMEW B OWL/Xi:I. 
By our camp-fires rose a 
murmur 
At the dawning of the day, 
And the trend of many footsteps 
Spoke the advent of. the fray; 
And as we took our places, 
Few and stern were our words, 
While some were tightening horse-girths, 
And others girding swords. 
The trumpet blast has sounded 
Our footmen to array — 
The willing steed has bounded, 
Impatient for the fray— 
The green flag is unfolded, 
While rose the cry of joy : 
" 
Heaven speed dear Ireland's banner, 
To-day at Fontenoy !' 
We looked upon that banner, 
And the memory arose 
Of our homes and perished kindred, 
Wnere the Lee or Shannon flows; 
We looked upon that banner, 
And we swore to God on high, 
To smite to-day the Saxons' might, 
To conquer or to die! 
Loud swells the charging trumpet— 
"Ds a 
voice from our own land— 
God of battles—God of vengeance, 
Guide to day the patriot's brand; 
There are stains to wash away— 
There are memories to destroy, 
In the best blood of the Briton, 
To-day at Fontenoy. 
Plunge deep the fiery rowels, 
In a 
thousand reeking flanks— 
Down chivalry of Ireland, 
Down on the British ranks—

Beneath our sabres reel — 
Through their ranks. then, with tine war-horse, 
Through their bosoms with the steel. 
With one shout for good King Louis, 
And the fair land of the vine, 
Like tine wrathful Alpine tempest, 
We swept upon their line— 
Then ran along the battle- field, 
Triumphant our hurrah I 
And we smote them down, still cheering: 
"

As prized as is the blessing 
From an aged father's bp— 
As welcome as the haven 
To the tempest- driven ship— 
As dear as to the lover, 
The smile of gentle maid—

To the swords of the Brigade. 
See their shattered forces flying, 
A broken, routed line— 
See England, what brave laurels 
For your brow to- day we twine!

PADDY AT THE THEATRE. 
Trnm the county of Monaghan lately I 
came, 
I'm a 
tinker by trade Larry Dooly's my name. 
My cousin, Thu Murphy, I 
met yesterday, 
Says he. 
Mr. Booty ' 11 you go to the piay i!" 
Derry down, town down derry down. 
" 
Is it the play that you mean, are you sure that you'r right I 
They re treating the town with Pizzaro, to-night." 
But the treat, as he called it, and the one that I 
mean, 
Bad luck to his treat, it cost rue all my tin. 
Derry down, down, down, derry down. 
Well, the green curtain drew np, and a 
lady I 
spied, 
When a 
man came to kiss her she scornfully cried, 
"Get out. 
on big blackguard, I'll bother your jig," 
When in comes Pizzaro with a 
grunt like a 
pig. 
Derry down, down, down, derry down. 
In the days of mild Gonry a 
long time ago, 
The Spaniards claimed war. ' gainst Peru yen know; 
They demanded its cash, its jewels and keys. 
When a 
boy they called howler, says, " No. if you please." 
Derry down, down, down, derry down. 
Then howler came on. like a 
day- star appeared, 
lie made a 
long speech, and the sogers all cheer'd, 
Says he, " beat well the Spaniards, and do the neat thing, 
And then boys, stand up for your mum 
try and King. 
Derry down, down, down, derry down. 
Then Mr. Murphy Alonzo, somehow went to jail, 
lie got out by a 
hack door witheut giving bail, 
While howler was jumping oe'r bridges and greens, 
He was shot by some blackguard behind the big screens. 
Derry down, down, down, derry down. 
Then howler came forward, and with him a 
child, 
Looking all for the world like a 
man that was w:bl ; 
" 
Here's your gossoon, dear cora. for its my blood that's spilt. 
In defence of your child, blood-an minds I'm kilt.' 
Berry down, down, down. derry down. 
r 
Then Alonzo, and Pizzaro, had a 
terrible fight, 
Pizzaro got killed, that seemed perfectly right. 
For the audience came down with showers of applause, 
They were all enlisted in the Peruvian s 
cause. 
Derry down, down, down, derry down. 
Then Alonzo came forward and handsomely bowed, 
Saying, " Ladies and gentlemen," meaning the crowd; 
" 
By Your kind permission. to morrow, then, 
We will murder Pizzarro over again." 
Derry down, down, down, derry down,

And its foes well know its fame.

Its the hope and the pride of an Irishman. 
It always is the best of friends, 
When its on mischief bent; 
It always gives whate'er it lends 
To their hearts' content; 
And he makes peace in a 
warlike way 
And when in love 'twill get, 
The Shelalah never runs away 
Without he pays his debt. 
The Shelalah's, cEe. 
Fle's always at home, where 'er he'll go 
And ready to assist, 
To back his friends, he'll whack the foe 
Wid nort in his hand but his fist; 
It has a 
warm heart in light or dark, 
Yet full of Irish pride,

To warm the fireside.

WHEN 
YOtf AND I WERE YOUNG, MAGGIE. 
I 
wandered, to-day, to the hill, Maggie, 
To watch the scenes below: 
The creek and the creaking old mill, Maggie, 
As we used to, long ago. 
The green grove ha.s gone from the hill, Maggie, 
Where first the daisies sprung: 
The creaking old mill is still, Maggie. 
Since you and I 
were young! 
CHORUS. 
And now we are aged and vray, Maggie. 
And the trials of life nearly clone: 
Let us sing of the days that are gone, Maggie, 
When you and I 
were young! 
A 
city so silent and lone, Maggie, 
Where the young and the gay and the best, 
In polished white mansions of stone, Maggie, 
Have each found a 
place of rest, 
Is built where the birds used to play, Maggie, 
And join in the songs that were sung. 
For, we sang as gay as they, Maggie, 
When you and I 
were young! 
And now we are aged, & O. 
They say I 
am feeble with age, Maggie, 
My steps are less spfightly Jim then; 
My face is a 
well written page. Miggie, 
But time alone was the pen! 
They say we are aged and gray, Maggie, 
As sprays by th.. white breakers flung: 
But to m you're f

When you and I

LESBIA HATH A BEAMING EYE. 
By 
THOMAS MOORE. 
Lesbia hath a 
beaming eye, 
But no one knows for whom it beameth ; 
Right and left its arrows fly, 
But what they aim at no one dreameth. 
Sweeter 'tis to gaze upon 
My Nora's lid that seldom rises ; 
Few it looks, but every one, 
Like unexpected krht, surprises. 
Oh, my Nora Creina, dear, 
My gentle, bashful Nora Creina, 
Beauty lies 
In many eyes, 
But love in yours, my Nora Creina 
Lesb'a wears a 
robe of gold, 
But all so close the nymph bath lac'd it, 
Not a 
charm of beauty's mould 
Presumes to stay where nature plae'd it. 
Oh, my Nora's gown for me, 
That floats as wild as mountain breezes, 
Leaving every beauty tree 
To sink or swell as heaven pleases. 
Yes, my Nora Creina, dear, 
My simple, graceful Nora Creina, 
Nature's dress 
Is loveliness— 
The dress you wear, my Nora Creina. 
Lesbia had a 
wit refined, 
But when its points ar gleaming round us, 
Who can tell if they're design'd 
To dazzle merely, or to wound US ? 
Pillowed on my Nora's heart 
In safer shunbcr Love reposes— 
Bed of peace ! whose roughest part 
Is but the crumpling of the roses. 
Oh, my Nora Craina, dear, 
My mild, my artless Nora Creina, 
Wit, tho' bright. 
Hath no such light 
A warms your eyes, my Nora Creina, 
SWEET KATE O'SHANE. 
There's a 
lass of beauty rare, 
With blue eyes and golden hair, 
One who mee's me often in the shady lane; 
And she 1:ves me well, I 
know, 
Though she nfver told tr e 
so, 
And I 
know I 
clearly love sweet Kate O'Shane. 
There's a 
charm about the girl, 
More than dainty eye or curl, 
More than all that lover's fancies may beguile; 
'Tis a 
good and loving heart, 
That from me will never part: 
I 
can read it in her happy, truthful smile. 
CHORUS 
There's a 
lass of beauty rare,

One who meets me • ften in the shady lane: 
And she loves me well, I

Though she never told me so, 
And I 
know I 
dearly love sweet Kate O'Shane. 
Come then sunshine, or come storm, 
There's a 
gentle fairy form, 
That will ever cheer life's path as forth we go, 
Come then sadness, or come :, oy, 
There's a 
peace without alloy, 
For the hearts tat ever trust each other so. 
Those blue eyes rnal: gently fade, 
As we go down earth's fair glade. 
And the soft hair lose its tint of brightest gold, 
Yet along life's varied strand, 
As we wander hand in hand, 
We shall never, never let our hearts grow old.

WilAT WILL YOU DO, LOVE

What would you do, love, when I

With white sails flowing the seas beyond, 
What will you do, love, when waves divide ur.,, 
And friends may chide us fon being fond ? 
Tho' waves divide us and friends bt, chiding, 
In faith abiding I'll still be trues 
And I'll pray for thee on the sto. _iooesus, 
In deep devotion—that's what I'll do. 
What would you do, love, if distant tidings, 
Thy fond confidings should undermine, 
And I 
abiding 'neath sultry sides, 
Should think other eyes were as bright as thine? 
Oh! name it not !— tho' guilt and shame 
Were on thy name—I'd still be true! 
But that heart of thine should another share it, 
I 
could not bear it— what would I 
do ? 
What would you do, love, when home returning, 
With hopes high burning, with wealth for you, 
If my bark which bounded o'er foreign foam, 
Should be lost near home—ah what would yoht do ? 
So thou wert spared, I'd bless the morrow, 
In want and sorrow, that left me you! 
And I'd welcome thee from the wasting. billow, 
This heart thy pillow—that's what I'd do I

PADDY Mc CARTFIY THE IRISH TINKER. 
Written by John 0' Brien Egan for Dan Bryant. 
Rwspectfully dedicated to Hon. Timothy .11cOarthy of San Francisco, 
by his friend Dan Bryant. 
In Ballinahack there resides an ould man, 
That can handle a 
chanter a 
spade or a 
pan, 
For his tinkering trade he's a 
beautiful plan, 
And his name is ould Paddy McCarthy. 
He rises at seven his work to begin, 
And he wallops away wid his sodder an tin, 
The girls wid their tay pots and kitties come in 
To be mended by Paddy McCarthy. 
On Fridays he goes to the market at Clare, 
Wid fresh lard on his brogues, and the same on his 
hair. 
He gets drunk and throws his hat in the air, 
Who wants to fight says old Paddy Mc earthy. 
One Shaun 0' Meaney a 
piper by trade, 
Who can chanter a 
stick or a 
spade, 
Swore a 
divil a 
tinker ever was made 
could wrestle ould Paddy McCarthy. 
One Dennis Gilloughly, a 
comical card, 
Wid a 
noddle as bald as a 
bladder of lard, 
Got jealous of Paddy from the way that he spar'd, 
So he challenged ould Paddy McCarthy 
They fought for two hours, but he murdered poor Mac, 
Wid a 
left handed skelp on the broad of his back. 
Paddy lay on the floor like a 
coal porter's sack, 
God be good to ould Paddy McCarthy. 
Po-..a. Paddy is dead, now the solderin' rogue, 
Tho' that left handed skelp from Gilloughlys kithogue 
Every boy in the village will la), bugrougue, 
Wid sorrow for Paddy McCarthy. 
His silent remains was stuck under the clay, 
Wid his budget and soddar in glory he lay, 
I 
hope for the corpse every Christian will pvay, 
When they read of ould Paddy McGtrthy.

TEDDY O'NEAL. 
dreamt but last night, oh, bad luck to my dreaming I 
I'd die if I 
thought 't 
would come truly to pass— 
I 
dreamt, as the tears down my pillow were stealing, 
That Teddy was courting another fair lass. 
Oh. didn't I 
wake with a 
weeping and wailing ! 
The thought of the grief was too deep to conceal. 
My mother cried, " Norab, child, what is your ailing?" 
But all I 
could utter was" Teddy O'Neal." 
I've been to the cabin he danced his wild jigs in, 
As tine a 
mud palace as ever was seen ; 
Although it did serve to keep poultry and pigs in 
I'm sure it was always most illegant clean. 
But now all about seems lonely and dreary; 
All sad, and all lonely, no piper, no reel, 
Not even the sun thro' the casement is cheery, 
Since 1 
left that dear darling, oh, Teddy O'Neal. 
Shall I 
ever forget when the big ship was ready? 
The moment had clime when my love must depart; 
I 
cried like a 
spa peen, ‘• Good-bye to you, Teddy !" 
With drops on Inv cheek, and a 
stone at Inv heart, 
He said ' twas to better his fortune he's roaming, 
But what would be gold to the joy I 
should feel, 
If he'd only come back to me, honest and loving, 
Still poor, but my own dear Teddy O'Neal.

Oh sweet is the smile of the beautiful morn,

You don't how know happy I'll be;

And for ever be happy with me! 
I'll smile when you smile, and I'll weep when you weep, 
I'll give you a 
kiss for a 
kiss, 
And all the fond vows that I've made you, I'll keep 
What more can I 
promise than this ? 
Does the sea have such bright and such beautiful charms 
That your heart will not leave it for me ? 
Oh! why did I 
let you go out of my arms, 
Like a 
bird that was caged and is free 
Oh I

And my heart is still trusting and kind; 
It was you who first took it, and can you forget, 
That love for a- other you'd find ? 
No! no! if you break it with sorrow and pain, 
I'll then have a

If you'll bring it'to me,

Original Hibernicon. 
Arrah! Nellie my dear, come stand by me here, 
Till I 
tip you a 
bit of my blarney, 
sing you fine songs, ' bout the poker and tongs, 
And the beautiful Lakes of Killarney. 
I'll wrap my big coat,round your neck and your throat, 
For to keep the night dew from my daisy, 
Then my m•in your dear waist, shall most lovingly taste, 
And you'll giggle " Now, Barney, be aisy." 
T r" 
I'll tell von about, my own darling Isle, 
The nate Emerald gem of the Ocean, 
About the kings and the bogs, the priests and the frogs, 
And other strange things of my notion; 
I'll tell of St. Ruth, of Sarsfield too, 
And all about Corporal Casey, 
For its sogers you like, whether bayonet or pike, 
And you'll giggle out " Barney be aisy." 
Then 
spake of a 
cot—on the hills of Arcloe, 
With the ships and the sea underneath us, 
F,,r fresh air and fish, an illegant dish, 
Not a 
Lord in the land can ere bate us ; 
Then we'll stand on the rocks of a 
fine summer's day, 
With our ehilder so fat and so greasy, 
With the salmon and trout a 
jumpin about, 
Then you'll whisper, now " Barney, be aisy."

THE IRISH STRANGER. 
O. pity the fate of a 
poor Irish str anger, 
That's wandered thus far from his lime; 
I 
sigh t'or protection from want. woo and danger, 
But know not which way to roam. 
I 
ne'er shall return to Hibernia's bowers, 
For bigotry bath trampled her sweetest of dowers, 
That gave comfort to me in my loneliest hours, 
They are gone and I'll ne'er see them more. 
With wonder I 
gazed on you lofty building, 
As in grandeur it rose for its lord ; 
With sorrow I 
beheld my own garden soon yielding, 
Its choicest of fruits for its board : 
But where is my father's low cottage of clay, 
Wherein I 
did spend many a 
long, happy day, 
Alas! has his lordship removed it away ? 
Yes, it has gone, and I'll ne'er see it more. 
When nature was seen on the sloe-bush and bramble, 
Sit smiling in beautiful bloom— 
O'er field without danger I 
used to ramble, 
And lavish amidst her perfume : 
Or range thro' the woods where the gay feather'd throng, 
Did joyfully sing their loud- echoing ; 
The days, then, of summer passed sweetly along, 
Now they are gone, and I'll ne'er see them more. 
When the sloes and the berries hung ripe on the bushes, 
I've gathered them oil' without ha run ; 
And gone to the fields where I've shorn the green ""'44*.eik 
Preparing for winter's cold storm. 
Or I've sat by the tire on a 
cold winter's 
Along with my friends tolling tales of delight, 
Those tales gave me pleasure, I 
could them invite, 
Now they are gone, shall I 
ne'er see them more 
But Erin, sad Erin. it grieves me to ponder, 
On the wrongs of thy injured Isle ; 
Thy sons, many thousands deploring to wander, 
On shores otf far away in exile. 
But give me the power to cross o'er the main, 
America might yield me some shelter from pain, 
I'm only lamenting whilst here I 
remain, 
For the joys that I'll never see more. 
Farewell then, Erin. and those I 
left weeping 
Epon her disconsolate shore: 
Farewell to the grave where my father lies s-ieeping. 
That around I 
still dearly adore. 
Farewell to each pleasure I 
once had at home, 
Farewell, now a 
stranger in England I 
roam,

I've something more alluring, which perhaps you'd like to know: 
I'm none of your Bulgrudderies, nor other shabby families,

Where shoals of fish, so pleasantly, did sport about so merrily,

Oh ! those scenes I 
did enjoy, like a 
gay, unthinking boy, 
With the lads who live in Ireland, drc. 
St. Patrick was our Saint, and a

For his country he sighed wintn at twilight repairing, 
To wander alone by the wind- beaten hill. 
But the day-star attracted his eyes's sad devotion: 
Fur, it rose on his own nalive isle of the ocean, 
Where once, in the flow of his youthful emotion, 
He sang the bold Anthem of Erin go bragh. 
Oh ! sad is my fate, said the heart-broken stranger,

Cheer, boys, cheer, for the new and happy land.

The wind was rather strong that way. 
It fact it blew us all away,

For hanging to a

When the wind took the hungry army. 
Then sound the bugle, &c. 
They cut my hair with a

And curled it with a

And fed me on some cabbage broth, 
To tight in the hungry army.

Then Mister McGlynn, when at home in Dublin, 
Will welcome you all at his new cabin door. 
I've found many cronies amongst the Malonys, 
And often drank whiskey wid Phelim O'Toole; 
O'Brien and McNielly and poor Miles O'Reilly, 
Were all of us sprung when we waked Tim McDoul. 
In the finest society, famed for sobriety, 
I'm welcomed with pride at each Fenian ball; 
I'll soon be an Alderman, like Jimmy Flanagan, 
Who lives on Fifth Avenue, as good as theta all. 
I'm Teddy McGlynn, ice,

THE DEAR LITTLE SHAMROCK. 
Sung by NONA at the lImeirsicoN. 
There's a 
dear little plant that grows in our Isle, 
'Twas Saint, Patrick himself, sure, that set it ; 
And the sun on his 1.r hor with pleasure did smile, 
And with dew from his eyes often wet it, 
It shines throueh the bog, Hire' the brake and the tnireland. 
And he called it the dear little Shamrock of Ireland. 
That dear little plant still grows in our land, 
Fresh and fiir as the daughters of Erin, 
Whosesmiles can bewitch awl whose eyes can command, 
In each climate they ever appear in, 
For they shine thro' the bog, thro' the brake and the mireland, 
Justlike their own dear little shamrock of Ireland, 
That dear little plant that springs from our soil, 
When its three lit tle leaves are extended, 
Denotes rot the stalk we ingot) er should toil, 
And oursel ves by ourselves be 1 
effiended ; 
And still thro' the bog, and the bra.ie and the mireland, • 
From one root should bra ,,ch like the Shamrock of Ireland. 
I MAKE NO NOISE AT ALL. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Written and Composed by Mn. CHAS. MACEVOY, for the Original 
Hibernicon. 
Some people think that they must make a 
noise to get through life, 
While others are more sensible, avoiding every strife: 
The wise lay low and wait their chance, the foolish loudly bawl, 
So here's my subject when I 
dance, I 
make no noise at all. 
Dance—Then watch my motion to and fro, 
So silently about I 
go: 
You'll see the movement of my foot, you cannot hear it fall, 
For when I 
do my little dance, I 
make no noise at all, 
I 
think it very foolish to confide in every ft end, 
And tell him all your business from beginning to the end; 
You can't trust everybody, if you do you'll surely fall, 
Ito wise in speaking of yourself, so make no no:se at all. 
CHORES 
Now as I 
think I've said enough, then silently I'll go, 
A, d 
if I 
have made too tench noise, of course you ought to know ; 
I 
hope to see you here again, you're welcome when you call, 
So recommend us to your friends, but make no noise at all.

OLD IRELAND, OUR COUNTRY. 
Ant r—" Wearing of the Green." 
pm Ireland, our country, shall soon her freedom gain, 
And from her weeping face shall wipe away the cruel stain, 
That England long has placed upon her once bright emerald brow, 
To strike the tyrant's shackles off—the time is coming now. 
Her homes have been torn from her, and her hearths are desolate, 
Her sons are in a 
dungeosi, and her dangle ere mourn their fate, 
But yet she'll rise triumphant, and smile again once more, 
And drive all foreign tyranny away from Erin's shore. 
For years the noble-hearted have mourned their country's wrongs, 
And vowed tliey would possess that land which to Irishmen belongs, 
They nave gone across the ocean-wave to the country of the fr-e, 
Though crushed their hearts, they still are brave and true will °vex 
be. 
The love of their dear island- home is planted in each breast, 
And till they have it mice again her patriots will sot rest--
1i 
They have waited long and suffered much, and will not suffer mere, 
But drivo all foreign tyranny away from Erin's shore. 
Then arise, unfurl your banner, and spread it to the breeze, 
Each son of Erin's isle, and all who've come across the seas ! 
Strike, strike for liberty I 
tha , word to Irishmen so dear, 
And soon our country shall be free— the time is drawing near, 
Oh 1 
Erin ! dry your weeping eyes, your sons have drawn the sword, 
Which never sluil be sheathed again till freedom is the word ! 
For yet triumphant you shall rise and smile again once more, 
And drive all foreign tyranny away from Erin's., shore,

THE IRISH CUPID. 
By 3. G. 
M AEDER. 
The Music of this Song is publiPbed by Wm. POND & CO., 547 
Broadway-, New York. 
Oh, Cupid is a 
native god. 
Erin is his mother, 
And Ireland is his own abode, 
lie never had another, 
In Blarney's groves the boy was bred, 
And buttermilk his pap was, 
Until with whiskey he was fed, 
Which rail her a mishap was; 
For it made him so warm and bold, 
That still it. is no wonder 
All great and small, and young and old, 
To Irish love knocks under. 
CHORUS. 
Och, love's an Irishman's employ, 
And at it he's a 
genus, 
For Cupid is an Irish boy, 
Each Irish girl's a 
Venus. 
Love's blind aid bare, I 
do declare, 
And lives upon pataties, 
Why he is so, if you would know, 
Why 
faith I'll tell you gratis. 
Love made each Irish boy so bright, 
They soon found beauty's prize out. 
For which. poor urchin, out of spite 
The heathens tore his eyes out, 
And to be sure he'd never roam, 
And so deserve our loathing, 
To keep love with us always vt home, 
He took away his clothing. 
For love's an Irishman's employ, 
And at it he's a 
genus, 
For Cupid is an Irish boy, 
Each Irish girl's a 
Venus.

THE POOR HOUSE. 
/MATE CASTLE GARDEN. 
When I 
landed at Swath Castle Garden, 
I'd just came from the say, 
In my p)ckets I 
had not a 
farthing, 
As I 
stepped out up the Broadway; 
I 
walked up to a 
lamp-lighter, 
The mystery for to unravel, 
His hair was cut short, like a 
fighter, 
So I 
shouldered my bundle and travelled. 
CHORUS. 
Hurrah for the stars and the stripes, 
And the land where we never s, e 
fogs, 
if I 
hadn't come here, by the pipes, 
I'd been digging up turf in the bogs 
Shure the road it was dirty and sloppy, 
Until I 
came to a 
street they call Wall, 
A blackguard shouted, there goes a 
Croppy. 
Whin I 
kim to the big City Hall, 
I 
axed a 
Dutch barber the way ; 
He answered me dander and blitzen, 
And a 
big old fat Yankee stepped out, 
And made me an American citizen. 
"Hurrah for the Stars, &is 
The first time I 
wint out to Chicago, 
The weather it was very warm 
The Commissioners axed me if I'd go 
And settle upon a 
nice farm. 
No, says I, I'll go back to New-York, 
Where the Politicks they are so pretty, 
Lave your Dutchmen stop here and work, 
But be jabers I'll stick to the City. 
Hurrah for the Stars, &e. 
Bad luck to that virlain from Sligo, 
Shure he tould me Lis name it was 'Tubbs 
Ue sould me a 
card for Chicago; 
Be my- s 
ui, 'twas an on d 
Jack of Clubs, 
at I 
inusn't indul,e in reflections. 
What I've said isn't worthy of note, 
I'll be running for Sheriff next electlen, 
So step up me brave boys, and vote 
Hurrah for the Stare, & 
The times are getting worse and worse, 
They're going down like a 
sinking purse; 
And if by chance you ask for relief, 
You're knocked about and called a 
thief, 
CHORUS. 
Eat, you paupers, eat, eat, you paupers, eat. 
Chop and bite with all your might, 
For you'll get no more till morning- ; 
Heigho ! here we go, into the Poor House, oh! dear oh? 
Spoken.—Bedad. I 
was forced to go into the Poor House, that's the 
no building, " outside," but it's awful hungry " inside," had lu ck to 
the architect, every two ends of the year we're brought into a 
big 
yard and we're fed by telegraph, there's half a 
pound of meat stuck 
on the end of the telegraph wire, and there's about five hundred of 
as for that, now then, stand round, the Governor says, oh ! we're 
round enough for all we're going to get. 
Heads up— too the line— are 
ye's ready ; bang— it's gone ; did you see it, Murphy ? no, no more 
didn't I, nor didn't smell it; and that's all we get from one year's end 
to the — come on, says I, to the rest of the cripples.— come on, and 
we'll make complaints, and up we went, and the governor was itting, 
down to a 
dinner,— none of your common bits of bacon,— but beef! 
beef! be the hokey, beef—the smell of it gave me cramps—Mr. Gover• 
nor, says 1 
to the governor; that's the first remark I 
made to the 
governor. 
Well, young man, what's the nature of your complaint ? 
Bedad, if you only say'd the word. you'd ltilow it. 
Hunger, that's the 
native of my complaint. 
Oh! say'd be, I 
see you're finding fault with 
the grub of the Union, and as you're the bead of tin • se pack of revolu-
tionists, I 
shall pardon them, and punish you. 
I'll send you for 
two 
hours next door, on the "tread mill," and I 
was forced to go. 
Oh ! the 
"tread mill" is what will give you an appetite for your b•eakfast. 
Well, Mr. Governor, I 
don't wish you any harm, but may I 
never die. 
until I 
see yoerself and Betty, and all the childer dancing the same 
jig that I'm dancing now. Hallo. Rooney, is this where you are ? 
What are you in for. 
I'm in for nothing. Sarve you right. The next 
time you come here for doing nothing, we'll kick you out. 
You're 
not fit to be in dacent company. 
What's that other fellow in for? 
Well, he was sick and the doctor told him to take something. What 
did he take ? 
He took a 
goold watch! oh ! the blaguard. 
Well, Mr. 
Governor, how long have I 
got to go? Two minutes. 
All bedad, says 
I, I'll have the jail first. 
Well, says Inc I'll let you off tins time, but 
if you ever commit the same crime, you'll go for seven days, 
So I 
started off singing— 
Heigho! here we go, out of the Poor House, oh ! dear oh! 
Heigh° ! here we go, out of the Poor House, oh ! dear oh!

ROLLICKING IRISH BARNEY. 
SONG AND DANCY. 
Composed by CHAS. M AC EVOY. 
Sung by BARNET THE Guinz with MAcEvor's Original " Ilibernicon.' 
I'm the rollicking Irish Barney, 
I 
delight to dance and sing, 
I'm fu.1 of the divil and blarney, 
And all of that sort of thing. 
Just w,.tch my graceful motions, 
As I 
move upon the floor, 
If my foot but took a 
notion, 
It would never stop I'm sure. 
(Dance.) 
CHORUS. 
B-a- r-n-e-y, 
Am I 
not full of the blarney, 
Just watch my foot astore, 
Its motion is so sure, 
The ladies' eyes they follow mine as 1 
trip about the floor. 
(Dance.) 
(Repeat the ladies' eyes, .1.7c.) 
I 
have traveled this country over, 
And to stop I 
don't know how, 
For I 
always must keep moving, 
same as vo -1 
see me now. 
But somehow or another, 
The p 
ople all agree 
When I 
sing and dance it pleases them, 
And of course it pleases me. 
B-a-r-n-e-y, &C. 
(Chorus and dance as before.) 
WHERE THE GRASS GROWS GREEN. 
I'm Denny Blake from County Clare, 
And here, at your command, 
To sing a 
song in praise of home, 
And my own native land! 
I've sailed to foreign counteries, 
And in many climes I've been, 
But my heart is still with Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
CIIORUS. 
I 
love my native country, 
And the' richer land's I've sate. 
Yet I 
can't forget Ould Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
Poor Pat is often painted 
With a 
ragged coat and hat; 
His heart and hospitality, 
Has much to do with that. 
Let slanderers say what they will, 
They cannot call him mean; 
Sure, a 
stranger's always welcom• 
Where the grass grows green. 
I 
love my, Us. 
He's foolish, but not NICI
ORS, 
His faults I 
won't defend ; 
His purse to help the orphan, 
His life to serve a 
friend, 
He'll give, without a 
m 
eirinur— 
So, his follies try and screen; 
For, there's noble hearts in Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
I 
love my, eak. 
'Tis true he has a 
weakness 
For a 
drop of something pure, 
But that's a 
slight debility 
That many more endure. 
He's fond of fun, he's witty, 
Though his wit ' tis not too keen ; 
For, there's feeling hearts in Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
I 
love my, &a. 
There's not a 
true-born Irishman, 
Wherever he may be, 
But loves the little Emerald 
That sparkles on the sea. 
May the sun of bright prosperity 
Shine peaceful and serene, 
And bring better days to Erin. 
Where the grass grows green! 
For I 
leae my,

THE RISING OF THE MOON. 
This song, which is the production of John B. Casey, " the 
Galtee Boy," who was an inmate of an English dung,eon, is 
immensely popular here, especially in the West, where it is 
often made the marching tune of bodies of men eager to 
emulate the patriot example of the men of '98. 
It is sung to 
the Air of: " Wearing of the Green ;" 
Olt ! then, tell me, Shane 0' Farrel, tell mewhere you hurry so ? 
Hush, ma bonchal! hush and listen, and his cheeks were all 
aglow, 
I 
hear orders from the Captain: get you ready quick and soon 
For the pikes must be together by the risin' of the Moon. 
CHORUS, 
By the rising of the Moon, by the rising of the moon: 
For the pikes must be together by the risin' of the Moon, 
I 
bear orders from the Captain 
get you ready quick and soon, 
For, the pikes must be together by the risin' of tie Moon. 
Oh ! then, tell me, Shane 0' Farrell, where the gatherin' is to be ? 
In the mild spot, by the river, right well-known to you and me. 
One word more: for signal-token, whistle up the marchin' tune, 
With your pike upon your shoulder, by the risin' of the Moon. 
By the rising of the Moon, &c. 
Out from many a mud-wall cabin, eyes were watching thro' 
the night, • 
Many a 
manly heart was throbbing for that blessed warning-
- 
Murmurs passed along the valley, like the banshee's lonely 
croon, 
And a 
thousand pikes were flashing by the rising of the Moon 
By the rising of the Moon, & c. 
Down along yen singing river, that dark mass of men was seen, 
ugh above their shining weapons floats their own beloved green, 
Death to every foe and traitor! forward ! strike the marchin' 
tune ! 
And hurrah, nay boys, for Freedom! 'tis the rising of the M0011. 
'Tis the rising of the Moon, &c. 
Well they fought for poor Ould Ireland, and full bitter was 
their fate ; 
Oh! what glorious pride and sorrow fill the name of Ninety-
Eight! 
But yet, thank God, there's beating hearts in manhood's burn-
ing-noon, 
Who will follow in their footsteps by the rising of the Moon. 
By the rising of the Moon, &c.

CARRY YOUR FRIEND IN YOUR POCKET. 
I 
don't say it's right, but there's a 
saying quite true, 
If you've goodness at least ' twill shock it. 
It's that selfish expression " Mind number one, 
And carry your friend iu your pocket." 
'Tis a 
palpable fact, and requiring great tact, 
Grim poverty's inroad to block it ; 
For friendship's all fudge, and that you may judge, 
If you hav'nt a 
rap in your pocket. 
Whilst you're young and in health, by industry gain wealth, 
Your coffer you'll very soon stock it ; 
After that yon can go and be scraped and bowed to, 
As they know you've a 
friend in your pocket. 
When Otis known you have cash, why the veriest trash 
You utter, goes off like a 
rocket : 
You're a brick' the a stick, and are flatter'd till sick, 
Thro' the friend that you've got in 
our pocket, 
But be poor and in want, and just ask for a 
loan. 
The Deed you set forth they oft nook it, 
And say, 
I'm so short,' or really I 
can't,' 
Or, ' I 
havn't as much in my pocket.' 
They say ' tis no sin, to be wanting in tin, 
The nerve of those needy, ' twill shock it, 
So wher'er you may rosin, abroad or at home, 
Put our only true friend in your pocket. 
THE BIRTH OF SAINT PATRICK. 
On the eighth day of March it was, sonic people say 
That St. Patrick at midnight lie first saw the day ; 
While others declare ' twas the ninth he was born, 
And ' twas all a 
mistake between midnight and morn, 
For mistakes will occur in a 
hurry and shock, 
And some blamed the baby—and some blamed the elook— 
'Till with all their cross questions sure no one could know 
If the child was too fast—or the clock was too slow. 
Now the first faction fight in owld Ireland, they say, 
Was all on account of St. Patrick's birth-day; 
Some fought for the eighth— for the ninth more wonld7die. 
And who wouldn't see right, sure they blacken'd his eye! 
At last both the factions as positive grew, 
That kept each a 
birth-day— so Pat then had two, 
'Till Father Mulcahy, who showed them their sins. 
Said ` no one could have two birthdays but a 
pair of twins.' 
Says be, boys. don't he fighting for eight or for nine, 
Don t 
be always dividing—but sometimes combine ; 
Combine eight with nine, and seventeen is the mark, 
So let that be his birthday,' Amen,' says the clerk. 
If he wasn't a 
twin, sure our hisCry will show— 
That at laste he is worth two saints that we know !' 
Then tit y 
all got blind drunk—which complvteil their 13118s. 
And we kept up the practice from that day to tkis.

BARNEY, 
THE DRIVER LAD. 
As sung by BARNEY THE GUIDE, with CHAS. 3.1ACEVOY'S Original 
Ilibernicon." 
My name is Barney the driver lad, a 
jolly chap am I, 
I 
always am contented, be the weather wet or dry ; 
I 
snap my fingers at the snow, and whistle at the rain, 
I've braved the storm for many a 
year, and can do so again. 
cuottus. 
Crack, Crack ! goes my whip, I ‘vhistle and I 
sing, 
I 
sit upon my jaunting-car. Pm as happy as a 
king; 
My horse is always willing, as for me Fin never sad, 
None can lead a 
jollier life than Barney the Driver Lad. 
My father was a 
carrier, many years ere I 
was born, 
Be used to rise at day-break, and go his rounds each morn; 
And then he'd take me with him. especially in the Spring, 
I'd love to sit upon the car and hear my father sing. 
Crack, Crack, &c. 
I 
never think of politics or anything so great, [state; 
I 
hate to hear their fly-blown talk about the church and 
I 
act upright to all men, and that's what makes me glad, 
You'll find there beats an honest heart in Barney the 
Driver Lad. [ Crack. Crack, &c. 
I 
think I 
will conclude my song, ' tis time I 
was away. 
My horses will get weary, if I 
much longer stay; 
To see your smiling faces, it makes my heart feel glad, 
So, drivers, treat your horses kind, like Barney the Driver 
Lad. [ Crack, Crack, &c.

PADDY BLAKE'S ECHO. 
Sung by BARNEY THE GUIDE. 
In the gap of Dunlo, 
There's an echo or so, 
And some of the echos is very surprisire, 
You'll think in the stave 
That I 
mane to desave, 
For ballad's a 
tiring you expect to find lies in, 
But sartin and thrue 
In that hill forninst you, 
There's an echo as sure and as safe as the bank too,

PADDY BLAKE'S ECHO .—[ CONOLUDED. 
If you civily spake 
how d'ye do, Paddy Blake, 
The echo politely says very well, thank you. 
One day Teddy Keogh, 
With Kate Connor did go, 
To hear from the echo this wonderful talk, sir, 
But the echo they say 
Was conthrairy that day, [sir, 
Or, perhaps, Paddy Blake had gone out for a 
walk, 
Now, says Teddy to Kate 
'Tis too hard to be bate 
By this deaf and dumb baste of an echo so lazy, 
But if we both shout 
To each other no doubt 
We'll make up an echo between us, my daisy. 
Now Kitty, says Teddy, 
To answer be ready, 
Oh, very well thank you, cries out Kitty then, sir, 
Would you like to be wed 
Kitty darling, sa3 s 
Ted, 
Oh, very well thank you, says Kitty again, sir, 
Do you like me, says Teddy, 
And Kitty quite ready, 
Cried, very well thank you, with laughter beguiling, 
I 
think you'll confess 
Teddy could not do less, 
Than pay his respects to the lips that were smiling. 
011, dear Paddy Blake 
May you never forsake 
Those hills that return us such echoes endearing; 
And may girls all translate 
Their answer like Kate, 
No faithfulness doubtin', no treachery fearing, 
And boys be yott ready 
Like frolicsome Teddy, 
But earnest in loving, though given to joking, 
And thus when inclined 
May all true lovers find 
Sweet echoes to answer from hearts they're invoking

Price Si% cents. 
Thady O'Flynn agin and agin, 
You said you loved me dearly, 
And sorra a 
bit I 
doubted it, 
I 
thought you loved sincerely; 
You said when we should married be, 
You'd make me quite a 
lady, 
But now I 
find you've changed your mind, 
It's ugly Norah Grady. 
At Flielim's wake I 
saw ye take 
Her hand with glances tinder, 
Tho' sorra a 
bit ye fancied it— 
I 
saw ye through the winder; 
Your arm you placed around her waist, 
Its little she did mind ye— 
You called her ' dear' right in her ear, 
I 
wish I'd been behind ye. 
Thady O'Flinn you vowed it thin, 
You'd make me quite a 
lady, 
But now I 
find you've changed your mind, 
It's ugly Norah Grady. 
THADY O'FLYNN—[ CONCLUDED.] 
At Goolah fair, I 
saw ye there, 
Along with Norah Grady; 
It's sorra a 
bit ye fancied it, 
But I 
persaived ye, Thady; 
I 
pity your taste your love to waste 
On Norah so consaited, 
Why I 
declare your'e muttherin' there— 
As if you'd been ill-trated. 
There, go your ways, yourself to plaze, 
You only need be throublin', 
Ye think there's few as fine as you 
From here away to Dublin. 
There's Pat Malone at least you'll own, 
And Mike, and Clanty Brady, 
And Barney Bourke, and Terry O'Rourke. 
I'm not in earnest, Thady. 
Now, Thady dear, come sit ye here, 
And Listen awhile to razin, 
It's sorra a 
bit I 
mind the chit, 
Sure I 
was only tazin. 
It's you're the one to throw your fun 
At ugly Norah Grady. 
ii.ow don't begin and do it agin, 
Now thero-'s a 
darlin' Thady. 
Beside the streamlet in the vale, 
In dreamless sleep my Maggie lies, 
Her warbli, g 
voice is bushed and still, 
And closed in death her azure eyes; 
Yes, here we oftentimes did meet, 
A 
sit beside the purling stream, 
But now she slumbers ' Death my feet, 
And vanished is my happy dream. 
CHORUS. 
Pest darling, rest, sleep dear one, sleep, 
From care and sorrow thou art free, 
Though at thy grave, I 
grieve and weep, 
'Tis sweet to know there's rest for thee. 
With broken heart I 
stand alone, 
And list to nature's plaintive s:rain, 
And in each sad and plaintive tone, 
I 
seem to bear her voice again ; 
Though I 
be spared till old and gray, 
My Maggie I 
shall not forget, 
Supreme my love shall reign always, 
Until life's ruling sun shall set. 
Rest darling, &c. 
BEAUTIFUL GIRL OF KILDARE 
Beautiful girl of Kildare, 
Fru dreaming, sweet one, of thee; 
Far o'er the sea we must part, 
It makes me sad. oh I 
it breaks my heart ; 
But be of good cheer and I'll see thee again, 
When naught will disturb our hearts, cause us pain, 
Then we'll be happy and free from all care. 
My be day, my beautiful girl of Kildare. 
Beautiful girl of Kildare. 
Beautiful girl &c. 
Beautiful girl of Kildare, 
Oh ! she's sweet to me, 
Her eyes are deep blue, and her hair 
It is lovin , and flowing so free— 
Oh ! say must we part in this wide world of pain? 
Not long, for we'll soon see each otl er again, 
Then we'll be ly.,

My beauty, my beautiful girl of Kildare,

I'M DREAMING OF THEE, 
NORAH. 
I'm dreaming of thee, Norah, I'm dreaming still of thee, 
Thy spirit haunts me ever, like fairy melody; 
When in lonelinets I 
wander, or in balls of mirth and glee, 
Ali I 
my heart to thine is turning, I'm dreaming still of thee. 
I'm dreaming of thee, Norah, 
I'm dreaming still of thee. 
I'm dreaming of thee, dearest, I 
dream of thee alone, 
I 
think how well I 
love thee, and feel we shall be one; 
For I 
know there is no other, e'er can be so dear to me, 
Ah I 
when e'er I 
dream of Angels, Pm dreaming still of thee. 
I'm dreaming of thee, Norah, 
l'Ln dreaming still of thee. 
ERIN TCAVOURNEEN. 
When the pure sense of honor shall cease to inspire thee, 
And kind hospitality leaves thy gay shore ; 
When the nations that know thee, no longer admire thee— 
Then, Eriu marourneen, 
love thee no more. 
When the trumpet of fame shall cease to proclaim thee, 
Of warriors the nurse, in the ages of yore; 
When the muse, and the record of genius disclaim thee, 
Then, Erin mavourneen, I'll love thee no more. 
When thy brave sons no longer are generons and witty, 
And cease to be loved by the fair they adore; 
When thy daughters no longer are virtuous and pretty_ 
Then Erin mavourneeu, I'll love thee no more.
