Little Oney
LITTLE ONEY 5127 A1
Mrs. Spainhard Arvin, 1941
George Miller told Oney To meet at Adams Springs He would bring her some money And
many fine things.
He brought her no money But flattering came You and I will get married And it won'y be no
shame.
So get up behind me And away we will ride Till we come to a city Where I'll make you my
bride.
She got up behind him And to town they did ride Till they came to a river Where the waters
flowed wide.
Get down here, Little Oney, I'll tell you my mind My mind is to drown you And leave you
behind.
He kicked her he cuffed her He slung her around He threw her in the river Just
Little Oney being missing All the people gathered round Nowhere could they see her
Nowhere on the ground.
You may drown me you may hang me For I am the man That drowned Little Oney Just
below the mill dam.
