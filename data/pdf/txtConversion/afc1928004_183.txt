GUS WILLIAMS. 
TO MY PATRONS— THE PUBLIC. 
AGAIN 1 
make my appearance in print. I 
have little in-
clination, and less time to use the pen ; but a 
few words 
to the vast number of music-loving people who have so 
liberally patronised my public efforts to please, seem to 
be called for on this occasion, when I am launching 
another little bark, whose sails I 
trust will be filled and 
fanned by the breeze of approbation. As has been the 
ease with every song-book that bears my name, this one 
will be found entirely free from the slightest taint of im-
morality and vulgarity ; for I 
believe that any qttantity 
of jollity and good-humor can be engendered without 
writing or uttering a 
sentence that would flush the p-Irest 
cheek with an indignant blush. I 
have endeavored in all 
my personations and songs to excite mirth by mimicking 
the harmless peculiarities of Pat and Ilans—so that they 
viiI laugh with me as heartily as any of my auditors; for 
I never forget that Pat, whit all 
his blunders, is the 
eopat riot of Emmet the Ptire, and that Ilans, despite his 
oddities, is a 
countryman of Frederick the Great. 
A recent traveller says that when the Chinese were 
first defeated by English steamers, they put a 
couple of 
large cart- wheels on each side of one of their junks, made 
a "Teat smoke with burnino• wet straw in her hold, and 
sailed down upon the English inan-of-war, thinking they 
were putting a " good enough " steamer, where it " %% mild 
do the most good." 
So, in like manner, every brainless 
dunce that fancies he can sing, gets on a 
pair of brogues 
and breeches or a 
short— waisted coat like mine, and fan-
cies he is going to take the town by storm, as the vent-
4 
TO NY PATRONS , & c. [CONCLUDED. 
able " Gus Williams, the American Star Comique.' 
need not tell how lamentably all the..,e imposters fail— 
what a 
collosal collapse of huge gas bags ensues where-
ever these charlatans present their unblushing and cheeky 
frontispieces. 
But, I 
will leave them to relapse into their 
original obscurity. 
Here I 
would remark that nearly every Son e, n this 
volume is either of my own production, or has been so 
altered, and ( public approval says) so improved that I 
may almost claim it as my own. 
All the Songs that bear my name are exclusive, and 
original with myself. 
No one else has lot or part in the 
maner. I 
am thus pt ecise in stating this fact because 
some parties have meanly sought to claim the authorship 
of some of the most popular of my productions. 
Of course by the press and the profession these arrogant 
and ridiculous pretenses are only scoutel at— but where 
these fellows are not so well, or more properly, so illy 
known, they might gain a 
temporary popularity by their 
impositions. 
My principal motive for printing my songs, at all, is to 
prevent spurious and incomplete copies from being palm-
ed on the public. 
I 
am with sincere respect and gratitude, 
Always the Public's obedient servant, 
GUS WILLIAMS.

I 
feel 
so 
ye - ry proud now I'm 
a Dad, Dad, Dad! 
When I'd call upon my married friends, 
Each one I 
surely found 
Had lots of little images 
A-playing all around; 
(1) 
rm A DAD, DAD, DAD.— NoNcLuDED.1 
And every time I'd chance to meet 
My old chum, Peter Green, 
He'd say, " Why, Brown, you've not one yet, 
And I've got seventeen." 
• 
Spoken.—This became very annoying, so at last I 
said, " You 
needn't throw your seventeen children in my face quite so often, 
Peter 
I'm in no hurry for seventeen, and when I 
am I 
shall go 
to one of those convenient establishments who " supply families 
on the shortest notice ;" but he'll open his eyes now when he hears 
that—CHO. 
To behold the little stranger 
There's been quite an anxious crowd; 
They say, " Now I'm a 
father," 
I 
should really feel quite proud,." 
And so I 
do, and oft with joy 
I 
feel as though I'd burst, 
When I 
hear them compliment me 
On the beauties of our first. 
Spoken.—I 
was in the garden catching earwigs when the news 
was brought me, and I 
couldn't help doing a 
peculiar kind of a 
can-can amongst the geraniums. A gentleman next door looked 
over, and said, 
What is the matter, Mr. Brown?" "Matter," 
said I—Cno. 
Egad I'm that excited, 
Every now and then I 
feels 
As though I 
scarce knew whether 
I'm on my bead or on my heels; 
Of course, we'll give a 
party soon, 
Aye, a 
jolly grand affair, 
In honor of the birth of this— 
My infant son and heir. 
Spoken.—It's really a 
wonderful child, though born very young, 
and I 
can't do anything but run up and down the stairs all day 
singing—Cso.

Now don't you think it's very nice, in such a

To fix your arm around her waist—steal a 
gentle kiss, 
And whisper tales of love to her, and press her to your heart, 
And vow by all the purple heads your love will ne'er depart 1

Then pluck the gentle clover, that blushes at her feet, 
Then robe your love in garlands, there's nothing half so sweet, 
The rose will mantle on her cheek, her eyes will sparkle bright, 
All among the clover, on a 
summer's night. 
Cho.—It's all among the clover, (Sm. 
There's nothing in this wide, wide world, could please you half so 
well, 
As strolling in the clover, with tales of love to tell; 
It makes your heart rebound with joy, and fills your soul with 
bliss, 
To stroll among the clover, and steal a 
loving kiss. 
Cho.—It's all among the clover, dr,e.

told her what I'd do and dare, 
For such a 
darling's sake. 
FIRST SHE WOULD [CONCLUDED. I 
She hung her head, and smiled, and giggled, 
Her giggle to me was bliss; 
And when we parted on that night, 
I 
tried to steal a 
kiss.— Cho. 
I 
often met her after that, 
And I'd take her here and there, 
And every time I 
got a 
chance 
My passion I'd declare. 
I've vow'cl to be true on the top of Saint Paul's, 
On the Underground rail, Richmond Hill. 
At last I 
said, " if she wouldn't wed, 
By jingo! myself I'd kill."—Cho. 
I 
thought it was " right," and so I 
had 
The banns put up " on spec," 
And sent my love a " sweet silk dress," 
Her darling self to deck. 
Upon the wedding morn I 
called, 
My intended bride to find, 
Not dressed at all, and worst of all, 
She'd not made up her mind. 
Spoken--She said she thought— 
Cho.—At first she would, and then she wouldn't, 
And then, somehow, she thought she couldn't, 
And then she said, " I 
really shouldn't," 
And I 
was a 
naughty, naughty man. 
Well, after that, we married were, 
And we're pretty jolly at home; 
To one thing, though, my wife objects, 
That's when I 
wish to roam. 
She says that " home's the proper place 
For all good married men," 
If I 
trot out at night I 
have 
To be in bed by ten. 
fpoken—As for letting me have the latch-key— 
Cho.— Once she would, but now she wouldn't; 
I 
say " she could," she says " she couldn't," 
She says, " what's more, she's sure she shouldn't," 
And I'm a 
naughty, naughty man.

She makes me do the household work. 
When I 
come home at night; 
If I 
cough or sneeze when going to bed, 
Of course that is not right. 
If she should wake the young ones up, 
With rage she'll storm I 
vow, 
And if I 
snore too hard for her, 
Why there's bound to be a 
row. 
Cho.—There's bound, dre. 
She wakes me every morning, 
In an awful cruel way, 
She kicks me round about the room, 
Yet not a 
sentence dare I 
say; 
I 
have to wash my stockings, 
My fronts and shirts, I 
vow, 
And if I 
don't wash for her as well 
There's bound to be a 
row. 
Cho.—There's bound, Ice. 
And when I'm paid my wages, 
After working hard all week, 
I 
give her every farthing up, 
And then she's got the cheek 
To give me two pence for mysel4, 
And for that I 
have to bow, 
But if I 
spend it all at once 
There's bound to be a 
row. 
Cho.—There's bound, dze. 
When we had neither girl nor boy, 
She cast on me the blame; 
Now that we've five little ones, 
She grumbles just the same; 
But I 
no longer must be stopping, 
So at once I'll make my bow, 
For if my old woman should but pop in, 
There's bound to be a 
row. 
Cho.—There's bound, 63.

sore, 
Oh, where's Ho - san • na 
gone ?  
I'm sure no other maid 
Could equal my Rosanna, 
Without my love this manly form 
Will soon become a 
wreck; 
WHERE'S ROSANNA GONE.—[ CONCLUDED.] 
Of her dad I 
was afraid, 
lie's a 
disagreeable tanner, 
And he's often promised faithful 
He'd dislocate my neck. 
Chorus.—So I 
used to kiss Rosanna just behind the kitchen door, 
But I 
uc'er shall squeedge, &c. 
Of an evening after tea, 
While her daddy blew his 'bacca, 
I'd seek my love Rosanna, 
And ask her to share my lot. 
But when he found it out, 
Oh my! how he would whack her, 
While I'd jump over the garden-wall, 
As though I'd just been shot. 
Cho.—I 
shall never kiss my love, Ate. 
I'd jumped over the wall one night 
In search of sweet Rosanna, 
And though I 
gently whistled, 
My love did not appear; 
But my hair stood bolt upright, 
For out came her dad, the tanner, 
Oh! my teeth they rattled like dominoes, 
And my legs doubled up with fear. 
Spoken.— At the end of our interview I 
felt convinced that he 
understood what " tanning " was, and so did L I 
also concluded 
Cho.—I 
shall never see my love, &c. 
Some say she's hid away 
By her cruel dad on purpose, 
To cure her of her love for me, 
Some say my love's no more. 
If she's defunct, then soon 
Shall they find my clay-cold corpus, 
And our ghosts shall come, and frighten her dad 
Behind the kitchen door. 
Cho.—I 
shall never kiss my love, & c.

To dilate on this beautiful creature 
Is a 
task not easily done, 
She's a

She can hop, skip, and do the little caper 
On her toes, and leap in the air, 
The other ballet girls can ue'er ape her, 
My Carrie with the golden hair.

There's Ada, Lillie, and Ettie, 
And a 
score of other girls as well, 
None of these are really so pretty 
As my blue-eyed, my dancing little belle, 
Sheep's eyes she's continually casting 
At me in the stalls, I 
declare; 
I'm thinking of that girl everlasting, 
My Carrie with the golden hair.

By the gov'nor, who's cross as a

But to live on cold mutton I'm willing 
In a

don't Put your foot on 
a man when he's down. 
The poor laboring man, who tries all he can, 
To battle his way through life's throng; 
Oft finds, to his cost, that cold winter's frost 
Impedes much his getting along. 
The working men thrive in the industrial hive, 
Something to put by from their trade; 
Commercial depression brings stern retrogression, 
And swallows the little they've made.— Cho. 
How many good men have again and again 
Given way 'neath the world's heavy cares, 
For want of a 
start from a 
generous heart, 
Whose fortune's been brighter than theirs. 
And time after time we hear of some crime 
Induced by sad poverty keen, 
That might have been stayed, had an effort been made 
Before he'd such misery seen.— Cho. 
Misfortune's cold shade, visits every glade, 
The rich man as well as the poor; 
Then hesitate not while wealth you have got, 
To help whom you can from your store. 
Ere long it may be fate's cruel decree 
Your hope's fairest prospects to smother, 
You'll surely find then kind, good-hearted men, 
To help you as you've helped some other.— Cho.

As sung by Gus wuxuals. 
Dwas at a Lager Bier saloon, 
Vay down in VilHam sdreet, 
I 
used to meet a 
German girl, 
Who always looked so neat, 
Such eyes, such teeth, and such a 
nose, 
I 
never seen before, 
I 
did not notice vot I 
eat, 
Undill I paid de score. 
Spoken—Den Yen I 
asked her vot I 
had, she said I 
had 
CHORUS.

Blood puddidg, sauer-kraut, yid' you said vos immense, 
Rhine-vine, sausages, smear-kase, und liver wust, 
Dat added up togeder, makes a 
dollar fildeen cends. 
I 
looked at her, I 
squeezed her hand, 
De squeeze she den returned, 
I 
vent next day to see dis gal, 
Because my bosom burned ; 
I 
could'ut eat me noting 
I 
felt so awful queer, 
Una she vinked her glass-eye at me, 
Una den vispered in my ear. 
Snoken—Yes, she said dot I had better order— - 
Roast Pork, Boiled Pork, Sce. 
I 
told her dot I 
loved lieu, 
Uncl I 
asked her for her hand, 
I 
told her I

Und I owned a

Und learn to live on love.

Won't yon tell me, Mollie darling, 
That you love none else but me, 
For I 
love you, Mollie darling, • 
You are all the world to me. 
0! tell me, darling, that you love me, 
Put your little hand in mine, 
Take my heart, sweet Mollie darling, 
Say that you will give me thine. 
CHORUS. 
Mollie, fairest, sweetest, dearest, 
Look up. darling, tell me this; 
Do you love me. Mollie darling, 
Let your answer be a 
kiss. 
Stars are smiling, Mollie darling, 
Thro' the mysti.; veil of night; 
They seem laughing. Mollie darling, 
While fair Luna hides her light. 
01 no one listens but the flowers, 
While they hang their heads in shame, 
They are modest, Mollie darling, 
When they hear me call your name. 
Mollie, fairest, &e. 
I 
must leave you, Mollie darling, 
Tho' the parting gives me pain ; 
When the stars shine. Mollie darling, 
I 
will meet you here again. 
0! good -tight. Mollie, good-bye, loved one, 
happy may you ever be, 
When you're dreaming, Mollie darling, 
Don't forget to dream of me.

WHEN THESE OLD CLOTHES WERE NEW 
As sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
Eight years ago, I 
looked a 
swell, sirs, 
NVith walking cane, and purse as long, 
I 
quizzed the ladies in the street, sirs, 
Alas, that game did not last lung, 
I 
married got, to my misfortune, 
From that day every penny flew, 
For soon I 
spent the marriage portion, 
On may wedding-day these clothes were new 
We went to church, so blythe and merry, 
This 
at of mine was new and light, 
We drank or crusted port and sherry, 
And ey'ry eye was beaming; bright. 
or you, poor hat, can tell the hist'ry 
Of where we go, and what we do, 
But how you stand it is a 
inist'ry— 
Think of the days whim yt,u were new. 
n (1 
you, poor coat, have got .:± uite seedy2 
I 
never cuffed you, speak the t:ut;h, 
You cannot say that I 
was greedy, 
I 
filled your pockets, yes, forsooth, 
For ev'ry morning you 1 
studied, 
And after dinner open threw, 
And seldom were you skirts e'er muddied, 
1 
!
Kept a 
coachwheu you were new. 
And you. poor boots, were bright as any, 
You really Were a 
lovely pair. 
Cleaning you've cost many a 
penny, 
I 
took you with me ev'rywhere, 
But farewell to the soles departed— 
For my poor toes they do peep through-. 
1.nd you, poor tops, look quite faint-hearted, 
How different now, then you were new. 
And you, poor gloves, my hands did shelter, 
Yet still I 
held you in my love, 
We through the world wen. 'leiter skelter, 
Like true friends, living hand and glove. 
But farewell, clothes, we part too soon. 
Then for a 
pauper's suit, grey or blue. 
I 
must die in the city prison, 
- 
Ju clothes I 
hate though perhaps quite new.

THAT'S WHERE YOU MAKE.—[CoNcrarDED.] 
Do not fancy you'll meet with a 
cabby, 
Who more than his fare will not take, 
May as well think an oyster could crawl up a 
tree, 
And there you would make a 
mistake. 
If you fancy a 
girl dislikes a 
small kiss, 
You must be—what some folks call—a 
cake/ 
If you think your collector of taxes won't eall, 
That's where you make the mistake. 
Don't imagine a 
man has no coin in his purse, 
Because he's not dress'd as a " swell," 
A 
book with a 
cover that's olden and worn 
has often a 
good tale to tell. 
You'll oft see a 
swell, all collar, and cuffs 
To his finger-tips, white as snow-flake, 
But if you believe he's all over alike, 
That's where you make the mistake. 
The ladies still wear an abundance of hair, 
'Tis a 
wonder their dear necks don't break, 
But if you imagine they grow it themselves, 
That's where you make the mistake. 
When courting, don't write spooney letters 
To your fair one, for lov e, nor for sport, 
For should you but break any promise, 
They are sure to be read out in court. 
When you wed, do not marry the famly as well, 
For that will not a 
paradise make; 
Above all, close the door to your mother-in-law, 
Or—that's where you'll make the mistake. 
But—talking of marriage—reminds me, 
We've given the Germans a 
shake: 
They fancied Louise and her cash was for tliem. 
That's where they made the mistake. 
Don't imagine your milk is not " doctored," 
Nor quite pure is your two-shilling tea, 
Don't imagine it's awfully jolly, 
The first time you go on the sea. 
Don't reckon your chicks before hatched, or 
Your duck may p'rhaps turn out a 
drake, 
P9n't go and eat mustard, and fancy it's jam, 
Or that's where you'll make the mistake. 
With all the advice I 
have given, 
Yo.i ought to be well wide-awake, 
And should you imagine I'll sing any more,

CRIME. 
As sung with great applause by Gus Wimi 
AWL 
MUSie publis!ied by W HITE & GOULLAUD. Boston, Masi 
I've been thinking of late, I've been thinking, 
My thoughts I 
can scarcely define, 
I've been thinking why people can wonder, 
At this terrible increase of crime; 
Cries, Old Uncle Sam, it's a " poser," 
There's a 
something I 
can't understand, 
I 
would just give a 
trifle to know, sir, 
Why crime should increase in our land. 
I'm sure that we've plenty of gold, sir, 
Our banks are as full as can hold, sir, 
We could buy the whole world I 
am told sir, 
Yet still, there's an increase of crime. 
It's true what you say, Uncle & amid, 
We've plenty of gold laid away, 
Mouldy with mildew and rust, sir, 
Guarded by night and by day; 
While you, like a 
dog in the manger, 
Your gold to yourself you confine, 
When a 
little would make a 
great change, sir, 
In this terrible increase of crime. 
For expenses you don't care a 
groat, sir, 
Politicians, you feed a 
whole lot, sir, 
While the poor man, with hunger may rot, sir, 
And still you wonder at crime.

CRIME.—[CONCLUDED. 
Can you wonder at crime, can you wonder, 
When you see the police on his beat, 
Arresting a 
poor little boot-black 
For earning his bread on the street ; 
While the thief on the corner stands grinning, 
In the broad open light of the day, 
Your pockets he'd pick for a 
shilling, 
And the law cannot touch him they say. 
He smiles with contempt and derision, 
lie defies a 
whole police division, 
While that poor boy is cast into prison, 
And still, you wonder at crime. 
Just think while you're drinking your wine, sir, 
how the poor of our land they are fed, 
While you, with your rich folks can dine, sir, 
'Tis a 
god send for them to get bread ; 
Go visit the home of the poor, sir, 
Such sights you will never behold, 
To cur prisons then go and explore, sir, 
4.nd scatter your hoardings of gold. 
A 
littic would soon break assunder, 
Time chains the poor sufferer is under, 
Go, list to that great vo.ice of hunger, 
And you'll never more wonder at crime.

REMEMBRANCE OF HOME: OR HOME ONCR 
MORE. 
Written, Composed and Sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
I 
am thinking of my home, 
Of the cottage on the hill; 
The cottage where my poor old mother died: 
Of the orchard, of the school where I 
learned the golden 
rule; 
Of old " Dobbin" on whose back I 
oft did ride s 
And as I 
recall the scene, 
It seems just like a 
dream; 
A dream that is past now, and is o'er: 
A tear comes in my eye, and I 
can only sigh, 
For to see my dear and good old home once more. 
CHORUS. 
Home once more, Home once more, 
Shall I 
ever see my home once more ? 
Home once more, home once more, 
Shall I 
ever see my home once more ? 
Shall I 
ever see the church where I 
often used to go ? 
Shall I 
ever see that dear old church again ? 
Shall I 
ever see the mill that stood right near the hill, 
Or must I 
in a 
foreign land remain ? 
Shall I 
ever see my father? 
That dear old grey haired man, 
As he sat in the arm-chair by the door 
I 
have power, I 
have wealth, 
Yet I'd give them all for health, 
So that I 
could see my dear old home once more. 
Home once more, &c.

MOTHER SAYS I

published in De Witt s 
Half-Dime Series of Choice-Music- For sale by 
R M. Da W ITT. 33 Rose Street. N- Y. 
Price five cents.) 
I 
fell in love with a 
pretty girl, 
A few short years ago. 
All sorts of weather, hail or rain, 
To court her I 
would go; 
I'd long and sigh with love until 
'Twas time to be away, 
And when I 
asked a 
parting kiss, 
She always used to say: 
CI1011US. 
Oh. mother says I 
mustn't, mother says I 
mustn't 
Oh, George. please, George, not just yet awhile; 
Mother says I 
mustn't, mother says I 
mustn't I 
Oh, George, don't, George, not just yet. 
I " waiting" kept, at last, one day, 
I 
thought I'd know my fate, 
I 
sunk upon my knees in quite 
An agonizing state; 
" 
Selina, say you'll have your George, 
And when shall we be wed ?" 
I 
longed to hear my love's reply, 
And this is what she said— 
Spoken—Well, George, dear, you're very kind, but we could never 
live on two hundred a 
year, so until you are worth at least five 
hundred per annum, darling— 
Mother says I 
mustn't, & c. 
From then I 
went to work, by Jove! 
I 
left no stone unturned, 
Until five hundred pounds a 
year. 
At last I 
really earned; 
Selina heard how things had chanced, 
And when we met one day, 
She seemed so pleasant, and at last 
She lovingly did say— 
Spoken—You remember, George, dear, what I 
said when you asked 
me some time ago,—well, George, dear, as you have so improved in 
circumstances, suppose you ask me now, Georgy. Porgey, darlingl 
Sh, what say 
Well, said I, upon consideration you're very kind, but— 
Mother says I 
mustn't, & c. 
Give me the girl who loves a 
man, 
And loves bim for himself, 
Whose first consideration is, not 
What he's worth in pelf: 
All sordid-minded damsels, who 
May worship golden dross, 
May they be old maids till they we, 
And we'll never feel their 
Spoken— So ladies who don't want to be old maids, mind you, don'l 
once too often say— 
Mother says I 
mustn't, ez.o.

PARODY ON TWENTY YEARS AGO. • 
Written and Sung by Gus Wthi.f..ufs. 
I 
wandered by the village, Tom-
1 
sat beneath the tree ; 
And gazed upon that dear old jail, 
That oft sheltered you and me. 
But none was there to bail me out, 
At least they told me so ; 
I 
was not acquainted with the judge, 
Like twenty years ago. 
The jail is altered some, dear Tom, 
Its larger now than then : 
Ws ceds are twice as wide, dear Tom, 
To accommodate more men. 
The bell is there that used to ling, 
When to work we had to go ; 
The music's just as sweet, dear Tom 
As twenty years ago. 
The boys are at the same old game, 
Of hooking on the sly ; 
They stole a 
ham the other night, 
'Twas oft dme by you and 1. 
They're gambling, too, for money, Tom, 
At seven-up, you know ; 
That good old game we loved so well 
Just twenty years ago. 
Down by the spring, close to the elm, 
You know poor William Way; 
I 
mean the old shoemaker, Tom, 
I 
saw him yesterday. 
Some wretch has kicked his stuffing out, 
He's dying, sure but slow ; 
Just as the one you wolloped so, 
Died twenty years ago. 
My lids have long been dry, dear Tom, 
But tears came to my eyes ; 
When I 
think upon that good old hash 
And those dear old mutton pies. 
went into Peet's to get a 
drink, 
But, Tom, I 
started so, 
I 
had narry red-1 
was dead broke—

Upon the military" she'd 
Declare she could quite " dote," 
She'd talk about " the gallant breast 
Beneath a

One day she wished me to enlist, 
Which I, of course, declined, 
And from that very moment, 
I've had serious cause to find. Oh I—Cho. 
One day I 
called upon her, 
When at her side I 
saw 
A 
martial-looking party, 
Whom I'd never seen before ; 
I 
gracefully retired, 
Though my heart near broke in two;

inquired 
They had " gone to Thnbuctoo." 
Oh !— Cho,

Wherever that may be, 
I

Then she e'er cared for me. 
Oh, mankind ponder ere you choose

Oh ! the daintiest darling of all— 
Little Maud, Little Maud ! 
Oh ! the daintiest darling of all!

The apricots ready to tall : 
The blue grapes are dripping their honey 
In sunshine upon the white wall : 
Oh ! whei e 
are the lips full of melting, 
That looked up so pouting and red, 
When we dangled the sun-purpled bunches 
Of Isabells over her head? 
0 Maud, little Maud ! say where are you? 
She never replies to our call— 
Oh ! where is our dainty, our darling— 
The daintiest darling of all ?

Fare thee well then dainty darling little Maud, fare thee

wish'd the rain would keep on as I 
rather liked— 
Courting in the rain, &c. 
At length the rain abated, 
And the sun shone out quite bright, 
And the little birds began to sing, 
My heart it felt so light. 
I 
gently press'd her arm in mine, 
And said now don't say " nay," 
But let me come and meet you here 
Again some other day. 
Spoken.—Well, she said, I 
can't exactly decide, you must ask my pa. So 
I 
made up my mind to go, and inform the old gentleman we'd been— 
Courting in the rain, die. 
We reaeli'd the old farm-house, and then 
She introduced to me 
Her pa, a 
jolly nice old boy, 
With him I 
made quite free. 
I 
told him when and where I'd met 
His daughter in the rain, 
And bless'd the lucky chance that took 
Me down that country lane. 
Spoken.—The old gentleman was quite delighted with my kind atten-
tion, and I 
soon gain'd his consent, which proves the truth of the old 
proverb," It never rains but it pours ;" and so it occurred to me, through— 
Courting in the rain, die.

TOORA.L-OORAL-OORAL LEE.—[CoNcLUDED.] 
A 
feeling of anger o'er me spread, 
I 
threatened to punch young Tooral's head; 
Then Sally's face got awfully red, 
When I 
asked her which of the two she'd wed; 
She up and said, I 
was misled, 
And was very ill-bred, on her heart to tread, 
That she couldn't conceive why I 
thought she'd deceive, 
That she'd very much grieve, if I'd disbelieve 
In her love, for she was certain that we 
Would always agree, and said that she 
Would sooner have me than Tooral-ooral-ooral Lee, 
Than Tooral-ooral-i-doe. 
So as on marriage we were bent, 
Why Sally and I 
to the altar went, 
Though I'm sorry she ever did give her 0-Iniat, 
But the crime has carried the punishment; 
For she's not content, that's evident, 
And I 
often lament that I 
underwent 
The experiment, for she's violent 
To such a 
degree, 'cos I 
could see, 
That Tooral Lee, was much too free; 
And between you and me, I 
think that she 
Is rather fond of Tooral-ooral-ooral Lee, 
Of Tooral-ooral-i-doe. 
And therefore, as a 
last resource, 
I'm going to try and get a 
divorce, 
I 
find that'll be the easiest course, 
And I'll do it without the least remorse. 
For ye know, of course, I 
can't be worse, 
I'd best be a 
horse, or a 
bloated corse, 
Than allow she and Tooral Lee, 
To treat poor me as if I 
were a 
flea; 
But I 
hope with glee the day to see, 
When sorry she'll be she discarded me, 
Because she wanted Tooral-ooral-ooral Lea 
For Tooral-ooral-i-doe.

I KNOW SOMETHING. 
Written, Composed and sung by Gus WILLs. 
I 
know something which I 
don't mind telling you, 
But keep it a 
secret, now mind, 
Becourse off my wife was to find it out, too, 
I 
know that mit rage she'd go blind. • 
It's about a 
young girl what I 
meet th'other day, 
While walking along in the street— 
And I 
know off this young girl know'd I 
had a 
wife 
She wouldn't think I 
was so sweet. 
CIIOEUS. 
Now you know what I 
know, and what my wife don't know, 
She don't know what I 
know, and what I 
know you know, 
If you tell her what you know, and also what I 
know, 
Then she'd know what I 
know, what you know also. 
I 
know that this young girl wore lots of false hair, 
I 
could see dat at once at a 
glance, 
I 
know that her feet was much larger than mine, 
I 
found dat out when we did dance. 
She got beauty spots all over her face, 
I 
don't want to make fun at all, 
She'd a 
mole on her cheek as red as a 
beet, 
And it look'd like a 
big cod-fish ball. 
Now you know what I 
know, dye. 
This girl's hair was red or a 
strawberry blonde, 
Her eyebrows hung down to her nose: 
She'd a 
mouth dat when open looked like a 
mouse-trap, 
It worked on a 
spring, I 
suppose. 
But still she's a 
beauty longside of my wifc. 
To- morrow I 
get a 
Divorce— 
And the secret is--well, I 
dont mind telling pot.— 
' I 
marry this young girl, of course. 
Now you know Nv bat
