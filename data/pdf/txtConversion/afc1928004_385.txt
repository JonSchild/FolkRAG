A 
MAN OF EDUCATION, 
Written by BENJAMIN COLLINS, expressly for SHEEHAN & 
JONES. 
Don't talk to me of your high toned men, 
And their fluent conversation; 
There's none with me, boys, can compare, 
I 
am the greatest in the nation. 
I 
am known by all, both great and small, 
An Irishman from Donegal. 
And the ladies all say, both one and 
I 
am a 
man of education. 
C 
I 
am an Irishman, both heart and hand, 
I 
have just come over to this free land, 
And I 
will have you all to understand 
I'm a 
man of education. 
I 
am never taken for Charley Ross, 
I'm a 
man of solid foundation; 
I 
will tell you, boys, that I'm the boss, 
And I 
am proud of my high station. 
Of the war in Europe I 
know all about, 
A brass band follows me when I 
go out, 
The boys all lift their hats and shout, 
For the 'pan with education.

GONE TO JOIN THE OPERA, 
OR, MARGARET JANE. 
Sung with great success by JOHN SEIEEHAN. 
Shure I'm a 
mail that's learned and grand, 
As any in this land; 
lint then I've had a 
sad downfall, 
And the blow I 
cannot stand, 
For Margaret Jane, my oldest girl, 
Has lately run away; 
Wid Brignolia she's gone to sing— 
She's the star of the operia. 
CHORUS. 
She can sing in the key of forty-three; 
She's a 
voice like a 
young blue jay; 
She's as fine and grand as any in the land. 
Now she's gone wid the operia. 
I 
thought to fetch her back wid me, 
Till the place where I 
was born, 
For to wed a 
Prince or an Irish Duke, 
And she laughed at me wid scorn; 
She called me " old Scully," and " Stab his ribs, ' 
Told me go hire a 
dray, 
Pull down my chin, wipe oft my vest, 
And come to the operia. 
She can sing, etc. 
Written by Joux SHEEHAN, and sung by SIIEEIIAN & JONES in 
their original Irish Comedy Farce, entitled " The Day 
we left the Old Dart." 
In dear old Ireland we were born, 
It's many years ago;' 
And raised up in sweet Monaghan, 
It's the place where were from, oh. 
We came over in the ship called Dreadnaught, 
From friends we had to part; 
It caused us both to weep and wail, 
When we left the Old Dart. 
CHORUS. 
We are poor old Irish green horns, 
It was hard for us to part; 
It caused us both to weep and wail, 
When we left the Old Dart. 
The morning the ship left Liverpool dock, 
Our poor mother did say, 
" 
God bless ye, me darling children, 
For you're going to America; 
You are going across the ocean," 
We thought of it on the spot, 
We often sit down and curse the day, 
When we left the Old Dart. 
We are poor. etc. 
BACK TO THE OULD DART AGAIN. 
Written by Huon J. GALLIN. 
Dedicated to SHEEHAN S 
, 
JONES, the great Irish wrest-
lers. 
We are two sons of Erin, 
We just came over here, 
From far across the deep blue sea, 
From a 
place we love so dear; 
With main and might, day and night, 
Our efforts have been in vain, 
We had no rest, so we think it best 
To go back to the Ould Dart again 
CHORUS. 
a 
Oh, why did we ever lave it (
sym.) 
Our hearts they now crave it (sum) 
We are two Irishmen, 
Both with might and main ; 
All day we tread for work and bread, 
We'll go back to the Ould Dart again, 
When we left old Ireland, 
With spirits light and tree, 
We took a 
trip in a 
great big ship, 
And landed in America; 
The politicians met us, 
And said to us quite plain— 
Tweed with a 
pang, gave away the gang, 
Aid is back to the Ould Dart again. 
Oh, why, etc.. 
And now, kind friends, we'll say good bye, 
We'll sing to you no more, 
We're going to cross the raging sea, 
To the home we do adore; 
And if we have not pleased you, 
We hope you won't complain, 
But with just cause give us applause, 
We're going back to the Ould Dart again. 
Oh, why, etc.

Oh, dear ! oh, nv! how queer we feel,

De time we beat wid both our feet, 
De crowd keeps shoutin' too, 
"Hip! hip! hurrah for de dandy coons, 
Dey're de gallant boys in blue."

'Cause we's gallant boys in blue.

OWEN REILLY. 
Sung by JOHN SHEEHAN. 
Oh, my name is Owen Reilly, 
I've got a 
son that's got me crazy, 
He comes home every night wid his blackguard songs, 
lie said he learned them up at some free and aisy; 
He wanted his mother for to put on the boxing gloves wid him, 
l 
le broke his little brother's leg wid a 
poker, 
lie have an old deck of cards, and he wants me to play 
Pedro, Sancho, Seven-up and the Joker. 
He says he's taking sparring 
lessons from Professor John 
Donovan, 
He bate the oldest boy of cross-eyed McGarrity, 
Ile goes prancing around all the dances of the city, 
And he have a 
girl who do be dancing at the vulgarities. 
Oh, he pawned me Sunday pants last week, 
To go and lay a 
wager, 
And lie brought me down the street that night, 
For to fight a 
big black nagur 
There's his cousin Mike, a 
nice young 111:01, 
Wid the flnest kind of manners, 
Night after night they roamed about, 
And they called it carrying the banners. 
But the two of them got in a 
scrape, 
They stole a 
Dutchman's. pony, 
Poor Mike is in the workhouse now, 
And Bernard's in Aronagonia. 
Oh, he tied a 
can to our dog's tail, 
When we'd gone to church last Sunday, 
He got stiff staving tight, and stayed out that night, 
And he was up before the judge in the morning; 
Be have the house turned inside out, 
He's gone to the bad intirely, 
Be heavens I 
fear that hell be hung, 
God help you, Bernard Reilly. 
Ile kicked his sister, Honorah in the forehead last week, 
lie wanted custard pie for his supper; 
And he came home wid himself stuffed wid boiled oyster stews, 
And threw the corn beef and cabbage in the gutter. 
THERE IS NO HARM IN KISSING. 
Upon a 
rustic bridge we met 
One afternoon in spring; 
his loving words I 
can't forget, 
Within my ears they ring! 
The swans were sailing on the Lake 
And all the Park was gay; 
My hand in his he chanced to take 
In such a 
charming way I 
The flowers were bright, but oh, his eyes, 
They shone like stars of night! 
His smile was like the glowing skies, 
And filled me with delight. 
I 
seemed in love's delicious dream, 
My heart with rapture beat; 
And while his eyes did on me beam, 
I 
heard his lips repeat : 
Cnoaus. 
There is no harm in kissing, 
Pray tell me, is there, dear? 
Those rosy lips invite me now, 
And no one lingers near. 
Then loving ones are meeting, 
No prying eyes to mark, 
There is no harm in kissing, (a 
7,'1',5) 
At twilight in the Park ! 
We strolled along where roses grow, 
And all was bright and fair; 
Ile promised ever to be true, 
And begged my love to share. 
The little birds were flying home, 
They heard my lips reply; 
And stars were bright in yonder dome 
Before we say good-bye. 
But, oh, he seemed so sad to leave— 
My heart grew sad as well, 
For love within each heart did weave 
Rs dear bewitching spell. 
-We lingered, though the hour was late, 
How quickly time had spud; 
But when our lips met at the gate, 
He softly to me said: 
Tlittr(3 is no harm, etc.

DON'T PUT THE POOR WORKINGMAN 
DOWN. 
Words and Music by BOBBY' NEWCOMB. 
Copyrighted, 1877, by F. 
W . 
H ELMICK, NO. 50 West Fourth 
Street, Cincinnati, Ohio. 
Price 35 cents. 
How oft when we hear of misfortune, 
Befalling a 
friend or a 
foe, 
If ' n 
joy or regrets we express it, 
That's the way of the world you all know; 
I 
thought I 
would speak of a 
subject, 
Interesting each village and town, 
That is iron- heeled capital striving 
To put the poor workingman down. 
CHORUS. 
Let capital shake hands with labor, 
Let the poor have the bread that they earn, 
For surely they need every penny, 
is a 
lesson quite easy to learn ; 
Remember the poor love their children, 
So give them a 
smile, not a 
frown, 
Live. and let live, be your motto, 
Oh ! don't put the poor workingman down. 
That money is the root of all evil. 
Why all of us likely's found out, 
The richer class think that the poorer, 
Should of pleasure know nothing about; 
The honest poor always will labor, 
They don't ask a 
title or crown, 
Why begrudge them sufficient to live on, 
Don't put the poor workingman down. 
Let capital, etc. 
So now- in conclusion I'll mention, 
That life being dear to us all, 
The poorer class must have existence, 
So — 
don't push them close to the wall 
Now hope that in future, the richer 
On the poorer will smile and not frown. 
Who ask but enough just to live on, 
Don't put the poor workingman down. 
Let capital, etc

MIKE KENNEDY AND HIS PICCADILLY 
HAT, 
Rind friends just listen to me now, 
A few words I 
have to say, 
And I 
hope I 
won't displease you, 
Here this pleasant day; 
It's about a 
man well known to you, 
You will say, no doubt of that, 
His name it is Mike Kennedy, 
And he wears a 
piccadilly hat. 
CHORUS. 
He takes in moonlight picnics, 
For dancing he is fond of that; 
And in a 
crowd makes himself loud, 
With his piccadilly hat. 
On Monday night Mike comes home tight, 
His wife to him will say— 
Come up stairs, dear Michael. 
And don't on the stoop lay: 
You know the neighbors they will talk, 
And what will you think of that, 
They will sweep the sidewalk up with you. 
And your piccadilly hat. 
He takes in, etc. 
What do I 
care for the neighbors ? 
I 
want you to understand 
as fine a 
looking young man, 
As there is in tins land ; 
And when the girls see him, 
Their hearts go pit-a- pat, 
They laugh and chaff, and say clear Mike, 
Shake that piccadilly hat. 
On Monday night you will lose sight of Mike. 
To the Fourteenth Ward he goes. 
To get upon a 
racket, 
With his week's wages, you know; 
Now, Michael dear, give this thing up, 
And try to save your cents. 
And buy a 
new style of hat, 
In the name of common sense. 
CHORUS. 
The boys-all yell at Michael, 
And say he is getting fat. 
They are getting up a 
collection, 
For to buy him a 
new hat.

LAOKA.WANNA GANG. 
As sung by KoNom,mAN and RIME with great success. 
Also 
sung by CONROY and MURPHY nightly. 
Here we are, two " LaOttwanna Spooners 
While we're here keep your eyes upon us; 
We load coal from Harlem to Gowanus, 
We're the two selected " Spooners of the Gang." 
When we go home our family we embrace; 
We eat our meals with elegance and grace; 
For opposition shovellers we long to have a 
race; 
We're the two selected " Spooners of the Gang," 
CHORUS. 
As through the streets we walk along like soldiers, 
And baskets and shovels we have upon our shoulders; 
For to get a 
job there's none can be bolder, 
Than the two selected " Spooners of the Gang." 
(Chorus repeated.) 
On Saturday nights we stand upon the corners, 
Along with the gang that wears the Roll of Honor 
At Hibernian Hall we're going to raise a 
banner, 
To represent the " Lackawanna Gang." 
We all get shaved in the one barber shop, 
We use the same razor, lather brush, and cup, 
For Bay Rum and Tonic we long to have a 
sup, 
To stimulate the " Lackawanna Gang." 
As through, etc. 
We've accumulated wealth with hard work and endurance; 
With other scallawags we have no interference; 
We have been hard tried by work and perseverance, 
The two selected " Spooners of the Gang." 
With the "General Committee" we are two great big cards, 
Like - Muldoon, the Solid Man," we hold a 
grip in the ward, 
We coulti put you on the Pipes or the City Boulevard, 
The two selected " Spooners of the Gang." 
As through, etc.

In 
IRISH BALLAD. 
As sung by En. HARRIGAN at the Theatre Condque. 
Music Published by C. M. 
TREMAINE, N. 
V. Price, 30 cents. 
My dear little Eileen is sweeter to me 
Than the ordorous flowers of the maythorn tree, 
She has hair golden fair, she has skin like a 
swan, 
Aud what shall I 
say to my own Eileen Bawn, 
And what shall I 
say to my own Eileen Bawn. 
My dear little Eileen has a 
heart full of love, 
And T 
scarce think of earth or of heaven above ; 
But the grace of her face from the night to the dawn. 
And what shall I 
say to my own Eileen Bawn, 
And what shall I 
say to my own Eileen Bawn. 
I 
think she's an angel that dropped on the earth, 
With her soft sunny smiles and her sweet laugh of mirth ; 
And I've oft thoughts of fear that she'll sometimes be gone, 
And what shall I 
say to my own Eileen Bawn, 
And what shall I 
say to my own Eileen Bawn. 
Ill meet her next Sunday by fair Avondhu, 
When I'll ask her to love inc and marry me, too; 
And rove in the grove till the twilight comes on, 
And that's what I'll say to my own Eileen Bawn, 
And that's what I'll say to my own Eileen Bawl'.

Sung with great success by the 
PEASLEYS. 
HI tell you of a 
jolly time 
We had while at O'Reilly's raffle, 
Some were dancing, some were singing, 
Others making lots of fun. 
Some were dancing with their partners, 
Others kissing in the corners, 
Music playing, whiskey flying, 
t 
O'Reilly's raffle. 
We were called up to the bar, 
We took a 
drink with Paddy O'Mar, 
Mickey Flynn, who had the most, 
He got up and gave a 
toast. 
tuoRt-s. 
Here's good luck to all the party— 
James Muldoon and Biddy McCarty, 
Michael Dolan. Teddy Began, 
Danced the dust out 'of the floor. 
Here's to all the pretty ladies— 
Katy Mack, the two O'Bradys. 
We won't forget the time we had 
While at O'Reilly's raffle. 
We played all games and danced all dances. 
From tho break- down to the lancers., 
raking jokes and telling, stories, 
The girls all were in their glory. 
Some were eating, some were thinking, 
Some were sleeping, seine were drinking, 
Others shaking for the turkeys, 
At O'Reilly's raffle. 
Then the ruction soon began, 
'Twas woman to woman, and man to man, 
Broken chairs began to fly, 
One struck me right over my eye, 
CHORUS. 
Music playing, whiskey flying, 
Some were laughing, some were crying, 
Others taking off their coats, 
And getting ready for a 
fight. 
The girls they began a-squealing, 
The big blaguards they had no feeling, 
At it right and left they went, 
And busted O'Reilly's raffle.

" 
There goes O'Donnell, the candidate, 
By him we're to be led; 
Arrah! he's the man that'll rule New York, 
An' won't he cut a 
shine— 
Whin he goes over to Washington, 
As a 
Senator so fine!" 
Dundreary O'Donnell, etc. 
Now that the election is over, 
An' the glorious battle is won, 
My kindest thanks I 
offer to those, 
For the work they have done; 
And whin I 
take my sate, my frinds, 
The public thin I'll show— 
That Dundreary O'Donnell is the people's choice, 
Wherever he may go.

My Johanna lives up in Harlem, 
Sunday nights, boys, sure I 
go there, 
Three long years her I've been a-courting, 
She's a 
beauty beyond compare; 
There's a 
kitchen bed-room and parlor, 
Piano to push and pull, 
They throw me out into the hallway, 
Sunday night, when the parlor's full. 
CHORUS. 
There's Dan Burns, the gladiator, 
Dionysius Caraliahull ; 
Making love to sweet Johanna, 
Sunday night, whin the parlor's full. 
My Johanna is always singin' 
" 
Hold the fort, for I'm left behind," 
" 
Eilleen Allanna went on a 
picnic," 
" 
For heaven's sake now pull down the blind!" 
Pat Murphy gives recitations 
On the taking of Sebastopol, 
They set me on the refrigerator, 
Sunday night, when the parlor's full. 
There's Dan Burns, etc. 
I 
went and spoke to Johanna's mother, 
Said her daughter had shaken me, 
Then her mother condescended 
To throw me into the street, you see; 
Then Johanna shouted " Papa!" 
He fell upon me like a 
bull, 
I'll keep away from sweet Johanna, 
Sunday night, when the parlor's full. 
CHORUS. 
There's Syd Welsh, the whiskey brewer, 
In Tammany Hall, boys, he has a 
pull; 
Making love to sweet Johanna, 
Sunday night, whin the parlor's full.

Words and music by Jous T. KELLY, originally performed 
by the only " Bards of Tara," KELLY & RYAN, with immense 
success. 
Here we are two scrubbing women, 
At this trade we make our living, 
Working hard the livelong day, 
For our rent and debts to pay. 
Our husbands, they were both of them brothers, 
From old Ireland they ran, 
Carrying the hod was their daily labor, 
Pat and Dan Gilhoolihan. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, please to take pity, 
(Symph.) 
While we sing our sorrowful ditty, 
(Symph.) 
We're washing, scrubbing and singing all day, 
And minding our children our time goes away. 
Repeat last two lines. 
Now we hope ye'll all have pity 
On us poor widders from the old sod. 
We can't find a 
job in the whole city, 
And to starve, by the powers now that's no cod, 
Here we've been these last five years, sirs, 
Left with children big and strong, 
I 
have three—and I 
have four, sirs, 
And there all of them happy as the day is long. 
Oh, please to, A.c., 
THE DAY THAT WE WENT WEST.

Oh, it's bothered we are really. 
We never have no rest. 
Since we met with Horace Greeley, 
And the day that we whit West. 
The divil a

Nor not a

Oh, how could they trate us so? 
Then we rid upon the stages, 
All 'cross the prairie land; 
And left the State of Ohio, 
For the State of Michigan. 
Oh, it's bothered, etc. 
We're tired out complate, 
Wid work and fat-i-gue;

If yees would interest

We're strangers from the West.

THE FEN1ANS' ESCAPE, 
TIM FLAH.ERTY. 
An original song of the escape of the Fenians' from Australia 
as written and sung by the great Irish Comedian and Vocalist. 
JAMES O'NEIL. 
NOW boys if you will listen, to the story I'll relate, 
I'll tell you of the noble men, who from the foe escaped. 
Though bound with Saxon fetters, in the dark Australian jail, 
They struck a 
blow for freedom, and for Yankee land set sail. 
On the 17th of April last, the stars and stripes did fly, 
On board the bark Catalpa. waving proudly to the sky. 
She showed the green above the red, as she did calmly lay, 
Prepared to take the Fenian boys, in safety o'er the sea. 
When Breslin and brave Desmond, brought the prisoners to the 
shore, 
They gave one shout for freedom, soon to bless them ever more 
And manned by gallant hearts they pulled towards the Yankee 
flag, 
For well they knew from its proud folds, no tryant could them 
drag. 
They have nearly reached in safety the Catalpa, taut and trim, 
When fast approaching them they saw a 
vision dark and dim. 
It was the steamer " Georgette," and on her deck there stood, 
One hundred hired assassins, to shed each patriot's blood. 
The steamer reached the bounding bark, and fired across her 
bow, 
They in loud voice commanded, that the vessel should " Heave 
to. 
but noble Captain Anthony, in thunder tones did cry, 
You dare not fire a 
shot at that bright flag, that floats on 
My ship is sailing peacefully beneath that flag of stars, 
rts manned by Irish hearts of oak, and manly Yankee tars. 
And that dear emblem at the fore, so plain now to be seen, 
'Tis the banner I'll protect, old Ireland's flag of green. 
The Britisher he sailed away, from the stars and stripes he ran' 
He knew his chance was slim to fight, the boys of Uncle S:tin, 
So Hogan, Wilson, Harrington with Darragh off did go, 
With Hassett and bald Cranston, soon to whip the Saxon fo.. 
Here's luck to that noble captain, who well these men did free, 
He dared the English-man-of-war, to fight him on the sea. 
And here's to that dear emblem, which in triumph shall be seen 
The flag for which those patriots fought, dear Irelands' flag of 
green.

Sung with great success by PAT ROONEY. 
I'm a 
lighthearted Paddy, a 
rale Irish laddy, 
I 
went to America strange wonders to say ; 
I 
sailed from dear Cork for the port of New York, 
I 
was eighteen long days a 
crossing the say. 
When I 
arrived in the land I 
was tuck by the hand 
By a 
blaggard who said, " Paddy, come go with me, 
And I 
will show you the city, the sights are so pretty." 
He says, " What's your name ?" says I " Tim Flaherty.° 
CHORUS. 
I'm Tim Flaherty, arah, gaze upon me; 
A 
lighthearted Paddy is Tim Flaherty. 
, He showed me around, the sights were soon found, 
I 
viewed them with wonder and astonishment: 
When he bade me good-bye, tears came in my eye, 
I 
found he'd been through me, and took iv'ry cint, 
What to do I 
didn't know, where was I 
to go ; 
So I 
wint to the Coort, and explained to the Judge. 
He called me a 
pauper, a 
vagrant and loafer, 
And gave me six months in the Island above. 
I'm Tim Flaherty, (tc. 
So I 
shouldered my bundle, and homeward I 
wandered, 
Ould Erin forever, oh, she is my joy! 
It's here I'm at home, and never will roam, 
For she's good enough for a 
rale Irish boy. 
Sure, there's whiskey galore, just here by the door. 
And beauties you ne'er can find afar o'er the say; 
And the girls are so pretty, so nate and so witty, 
And that's just what suits the lad, Tim Flaherty. 
I'm Tim Flaherty, &e.

That he's done all around, 
He wint into Mrs. Higgins' house, 
And her Sunday gaiters found; 
He began to ate, when she gave a 
bawl, 
Oh, I

row,. 
He sint her rollin' over the stove— 
She needs no bustle now. 
For whin he'd jump, eta 
Now it was here this afthernoon,

While I

And he sthruck me 7uHity hard 
He knocked me down, jumped on me, 
An' he ate the tail o' me coat, 
Blue'd glass have no effect at all

DON'T WAKE THE BABY. 
As sung by BILLY PASTOR. 
If you perceive my bosom heave, 
Tis caused by proud delight, 
For I'm a 
very diflerent man 
lo what I 
was last night. 
For some time in my house a 
nurse 
Ins aired her awkward charms, 
But, l'm glad to say, this morning 
I've found something in her arms.

said to the nurse in a 
very innocent sort of a 
manner : - Why, laws, missy, what have you got in sour 
arms ?'' She placed her finger on her lips and said, '•

feel so awfully awfully jolly, I 
think I

As soon as e'er the news spread ' round, 
In every neighbor comes; 
Some said ' what a 
darling child !" 
And others " Bless its gums!" 
My feelings were so glorious, 
Describe them no one can, 
And the ladies seem to look on me 
As a 
very clever man.

Good evening, to ye, Gents and Ladies, 
I've come to make a 
little call ; 
I'm descended from the great O'Grady's, 
The best you'll find in Donegal. 
A 
year ago I 
took the notion 
To sail across the briny deep ; 
The sea was in a 
great commotion, 
I 
could'nt get a 
wink of sleep. 
CHORUS. 
They call me roaming Mick O'Brien, 
I'll fight ' till I'm pushed to the wall, 
The young girls they were all a 
crying 
When I 
came from old Donegal. 
Sure I 
was known throughout the country, 
And devil the one with me could dance ; 
I 
was the first in every nation— 
And drunk when I 
had the chance ; 
I 
used to drive the women crazy, 
So nimbly I 
could shake my feet ; 
They never found me slow or lazy, 
At jigging I 
could not he heat. 
They call me roaming Mick, &e.

MITLCAHEY'S SISTER KATE. 
Air—" Mulcahy's gone away." 
YOU have heard them sing of a 
hero hold, 
Mulcahy was his name: 
And, faith! he had a 
sister, too, 
Was noted for her fame: 
She was chief-cook in a 
boarding house, 
And at making a 
hash was grt at; 
She came from the County Dynegole, 
And her maiden name was Kate. 
CHORUS. 
She is tall and thin, 
With her crooked shin: 
And her age was twenty-eight, 
Her cheeks were red, 
And so was the head 
0: Mulcahey's sister Kate. 
She treats me like a 
lady 
When her I 
go to see; 
G e 
s me into the kitchen, 
And treats me to cakes and tea, 
And oftimes I 
used to sit until 
It was very late, 
And whispering my love story to 
Mulcahey's sister Kate, 
CHORUS. —She is tall and thin, ate. 
I 
thought she was an angel 
When I 
kept her company; 
But in the course of time I 
found 
That she was fooling me; 
I 
went to her house, one night, 
And standing by the gate, 
I 
saw a 
greasy soapfat-man 
A-hugging my darling Kate. 
CHORUS.—She is tall and thin, etet. 
HERE I 
am an Irish boy, 
Who is always fond of mirth, 
And show me the crea ure 
Who would slight me for my birth, 
And I 
have a 
neat coleen, 
In Dublin far bellind,— 
I 
always was a 
broth of a 
boy, 
And my coleen she is blind. 
CHORUS. 
Good-bye, Biddy dear, 
It's hard to part from you, 
Although I 
am going to leave yea, 
Me heart it will prove true, 
Then cheer me, vourneen, 
And don't look so forlorn 
The harvest time is coming 
And I'm off to sheer the corn. 
I 
wouldn't have left Ireland, 
But times were hard, you know, 
To see the starving creatures, 
It would break the heart of stoat,. 
I 
bundled up my kit, 
While Biddy wept and sigh'd, 
Aid a4 the vessel left the dock, 
I 
step'd on b,)ard and cried,—

0 WHISPER while we tell to you 
A 
story that is short and thrue, 
The rayson why we had to go 
Across the raging water. 
The British army we did jine, 
They 'listed us for twelve years time, 
And thought they had us very fine, 
But we skipped across the water. 
CHORUS. 
Shug a 
roog, a 
roog, sting, 
Shug a 
roog a 
roo, 
Shugar in the tay-pot, 
How are you ? 
Away on the big ship we did go, 
Across the raging water. 
We liked the army well enough, 
But rations there were very tough, 
They fed us on salt junk and duff, 
And stirabout and water. 
They put us in a 
coat of red, 
With a 
will vin' plume upon our head— 
We often wished that we were dead, 
Or drownded in the water. 
Sling a 
roog, a 
roog, shug, Sat. 
They made us swear to sarve the Queen, 
They took from us our coat of green, 
They took our ould dudeens away, 
And threw them in the water. 
Then we resolved to take Frinch lave, 
For liberty we did s 
rely grieve, 
The British guard we did desave, 
And skipped across the water. 
Shoog a 
roog, a 
roog, slug, ttc. 
And now we're in Amerikay, 
We do our wo..; and get our pay, 
And many's the time we've blessed the day. 
We skipped across the water. 
The stars and stripes are o'er our head, 
The green does wave above the red, 
And British laws no more we dread, 
Since we'le across the water. 
Shoog a 
roog, a

PADDY'S LAND. 
Composed by JOHNNY ROACH. 
COME 
all ye boys from Paddy's land, who are inclined to roam, 
To reap the English harvest so far away from home. 
Be sure you're well provided with comrades bold and true, 
'or you have to fight both day and night 'gainst John Bull and 
his crew. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah, my boys for Paddy's land, 
"[is the land I 
do adore, 
May heaven smile on every child 
That loves that shamrock shore. 
'Then we left home for Dublin, the morning it being clear, 
And when we got on board the boat, we gave three hearty cheem 
Saying: Good-bye, my boys, to that dear old land, we ne'ef 
may see it more, 
For we're going to fight both day and night, all for that shain 
rock shore. 
Then hurrah, Sc. 
We sailed away from Dublin quay, and ne'er received a 
shock. 
Until we landed in New York, long side of the dock, 
Where thousands of our countrymen that were all in that town 
And " Fagh a 
ballagh, clear the track I" were the words that 
passed all round. 
Then hurrah, &c. 
Then away we went in merriment to drink bourbon and wine, 
Each lad he gave his favorite toast for the girl he left behind; 
We sat and sang, made the ale-house ring, despising Erin's foes, 
Or any man that hate the land, where St. Patrick's shamrock 
grows. 
Then hurrah, & c.

PADDY'S DREAM. 
As sung with great success by GARNELLA Ba(imam. 
JOHN BULL he was an Englishman, 
Who went on tramp one day, 
With threepence in his pocket 
For to carry him a 
long way; 
He traveled along for many a 
mile, 
Yet no one did he see, 
Until he met an Irishman 
By the name of Pat Magee. 
Good morning, Pat, says Johnny Bull, 
Where are you going to? 
Oh, faith, I 
do not know, says Pat, 
I'm looking for a 
job to do. 
Can you lend me a 
shilling, Paddy? 
Says Johnny Bull to Pat. 
Sure it's the only thing I'm wanting, 
For I 
havn't got nary a 
rap. 
They had not travelled very far, 
When a 
Scotchman, like them, out of work, 
And by his look and appearance, 
As hungry as a 
Turk. 
Can you lend me a 
shilling, Scotty? 
Says bold Paddy Magee. 
I 
canna do that, says the Scotehman, 
For I 
han'na got nary a 
bubee. 
Oh, I 
have got a 
three-pence. 
What shall we do with that? 
Buy three-pence worth of whiskey, 
'Twill cheer us up, says Pat, 
Oh dinna do that, says Scotty, 
I'll tell you what we'll do, 
Buy three-pence worth of oat meal. 
make some nice bergue. 
Oh no, we'll buy a 
loaf of bread, 
The Englishman did say, 
And in yonder hay-stack 
We'll sleep our hunger away. 
Well get a 
drink of water 
From yonder purling stream, 
And the loaf shall be his in the morning, 
Who dreams the greatest dream. 
Now. the Englishman, by the morning, 
Ten million men had been 
For years a 
digging a 
turnip out, 
The largest ever seen. 
At last they got the turnip out, 
By working night and day, 
It took four million horses 
This turnip to 'aul away. 
Now the Scotclnnan, by the morning 
Forty million men had been 
For years a 
making a 
boi er, 
The largest ever seen. 
What was it for ? says John Bull, 
Was it make of copper or tin? 
'Twas made of copper, says Scotty, 
To boil your turnip in. 
STOEEN.—Now comes Pat's dream. 
Oh, sure, I've been dreaming, 
And dramed a 
pleasant dream. 
I 
drained I 
was in a 
hay- stack, 
All by a 
purling stream. 
And you and Scotty were there too, 
You were, upon my oath, 
By the powers, I 
dreamed I 
was hungry, 
So I 
got up arai ate the loaf.

pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of figures.

of Harlequin, in his tesselated suit '•  the next only Columbise , then 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephistophiles. A
