TAPE BEGINS WITH INTERVIEWER:
Where was the, where was the (--) Can I put this on you?  Put you on, uh, put you on tv.  [O:  I 
wish I could stay.  I have to go somewhere else and tape more lectures]. [J:  Well I was going to 
say you could stay for a cup of coffee, but you don't have time, huh.]  [O:  I need to run.  I'd love 
to listen].
J:  [Unclear].  [E:  Oh!  How do you spell it?]  Oh!  How would you spell it?  I wouldn't even 
know how to spell it.  I'm the worst speller anyway.  I would say [Dhobot?], almost the way you 
would, you know, the word pronounced more or less.  [E:  When did she teach you?]  Uh, she 
was the school teacher of the Greek School.  [E: unclear]  Yes!  In the early years, the first Greek 
School.  And, uh, then I use to go to her apartment.  She taught me privately.  And my mother use
to crochet for her.  And she use to teach me her needle work.  [E:  What was she like?  What kind
of person was she?]  Very lovely person.  Very sweet, very well dressed, very neat, lovely, lovely 
lady.  Plus she had great education, you know, anyone that was educated them years in Greek 
especially, they came from across, they had to be up and up, you know.  The average person 
couldn't send their children to school then.  And then they didn't force girls [E:  to go.] to go to 
school.  It was the boy who had to go to school.  [E:  Boys had to go and the girls had to (--)]  
Yes.  Not the girls.  So for a woman who was well educated then and uh, let's say I was about 10 
years old then, and she was a woman maybe in her 30's or older, and she came to this country 
well educated. 
E:  Do you remember what her lessons were like?  
J:  At home?  [E:  Yeah!]  Well she, uh, she taught me to follow the, uh, the design and if I went 
one stitch off the thing she made me rip right out.  I didn't (--)  That's why I said I use to do good 
work, I never went a stitch out.  I wouldn't let myself.  Even in the later years that I was doing it, 
I wouldn't let myself go out of a place.  And you know, that way I think I find (--).  I just learned 
to do it right.  And I followed it right up to now.  I mean I don't do the work I use to, but I know 
it's not as bad as, uh, other ladies that would just stitch it and don't worry about where there 
needle goes.  But I was taught to do it just perfect.  [E:  She must have been patient person]  Very
lovely lady, and I loved her very much.  She was so nice.  Yeah!  Yeah, we've had a few Greek 
teachers in the early years, you know, but like I said these ladies were well educated and they 
were very patient, and very lovely people.  Our early years in Greek School was really (--) It was
fun.  It was lovely.  And if we went late we always got punished.  [E:  Hmm]  There was one (--) 
The principle stood with a ruler, how many minutes you were late you got it.  He said put your 
hands out.  [Both laughing]  Five minutes you got five points.  [Laughing]  [E:  Did it ever 
happen to you?]  Yes!  Once I think.  Once or twice.  Sure, I was a child just like all the other 
children.  You can't say we were perfect.  But it was fun because it was like home because we all 
went to back to where we belong somehow, you know.  It was a Greek area, like Market Street, 
Adams Street.  [E:  What was the area?]  [Unclear]  Well the Acre, around the Acre, it was part of
our area.  [E:  Umhm]  Yeah!  Of the lower part of, not the upper part, the upper part was Irish.  It
was like a separation.  Like I said, the whole city was kind of separated.  French were on the, uh, 
Little Canada, and, uh, the Irish were up over the Common, if you know where the Common is.  
And the higher class people lived up on Andover Street and so forth.  Everybody was the, you 
know, city, but the average person lived around the Acre.  The upper part of the Acre, the upper 
part of the Acre, the lower parts are the Greek people are the lower part of the Acre.  
E:  Were there divisions in the Greek community according to where people came from in 
Greece?
J:  Yes!  In the beginning there was.  In the beginning there was. Like (--)  
E:  What were some of the places common to where the people hang out? 
J:  Uh, well, like uh, like when my husband came from Laconia they were on the upper part of 
uh, like where there is a bridge down on uh, what is it now?  Fletcher Street.  Not Fletcher Street.
Uh, I can't even think of the street.  Well from the upper part of the bridge it was all that part of 
the country.  The lower part was another group of people from different part of Greece.  Each 
part (--)  They kind of all stuck together like, you know, like one family.  And when they came to 
America they all came to a relative.  So they stayed with the relatives and that was how it was for
many, many years. 
E:  What were your parents experiences when, where did they come from, did they both come 
from the same area?
J:  They came from [Spartner?].  Yes!  They all came yeah!  They  all came from Spartner.  That's
Laconia.  And they were all together, you know, the sisters came to one another, and uh, they 
married and then they stretched out, but they all still stayed around the same part.  And uh, it then
used to be a school at the Common and, uh, it was the Irish (--)  The Saint Patrick's Church, and 
the Greek Church.  Well there was a lot of Irish in that area. So they had just moved out.  But all 
that was more Irish and Greek for a long, long time.  But then they kind of moved out and the 
Irish went up higher.  And, uh, the Greek Church, course, the Greek people stayed near their 
church and their school.  That's another thing, you just followed, you know, your, what you were 
doing.  You wanted to got to church.  We had no cars.  We had no transportation.  So I remember 
it use to cost five cents to go from way up where we lived on Salem Street to down to the Square.
My sister and I use to wait on tables for on Saturday and Sunday at a Confectionary Store.  [E: 
Oh!]  They sold ice cream, it was ice cream, you know.  And uh, we could get on this little trolley
for only five cents, but we never got on the trolley in all the years we worked there.  We always 
[E: walked] walked, oh yeah.  [E:  Save the five cents, keep the five cents in your pocket.]  The 
five cents was very important to us.  Well, we didn't make much money working on the tables 
either.  [E:  hmm]  Course, besides working on the tables we learned how to put the sundays 
together, and you know, we made all the stuff and, uh, bring to our customers also.  It was a very 
nice classy place, but you (--)  [E:  What was the name of it?]  It use to be the Crown 
Confectionary [E:  Crown?] Crown.  Down at the Square where uh, almost where uh, hmm, (--) 
Who's there now?  There's a restaurant near the (--)  There's a restaurant down at that area now.  
There use to be two restaurants [E:  Uhmm] at the time.  I don't even remember there names.  It 
was nice, it was, it was nice (--) but of course them years where (--) everybody use to get out and
go for a walk [E:  At night?] window shopping.  [E:  yeah!]  And, uh, they would stop in and 
have ice cream and all that, you know, it was a different (--)  Like now everybody goes to the 
liquor or a bar, now, then it use to be stop in for ice cream or soda or something.  [E:  Or they'd 
go to the mall, you know, or shopping mall] Yeah.  Oh!  Shopping at the mall now is the thing.  
Yes.  Yeah.  But it use to be interesting because everybody use to take a walk down Merrimack 
Street.  And uh, they'd leave their homes and go for a walk and come back and call it an evening.
[E:  Hmm]  It was like a pass time.  You met everybody when you walked down Merrimack 
Street.
E:  You met all your friends.
J:  Yeah, how true.  It was almost like a meeting place.  You went down for a walk and uh, from 
the Lower part of Merrimack Street. Like not from the upper part, the lower part where City 
Hall, and down.  It use to be the Greek people would go from there down and, uh, other people 
came from further up.  But everybody use to be out at night.  Everybody.  [E:  How old were you
when you worked in the confectionary store?]  I must have been about, uh, seventeen or eighteen
when I worked there.  [E:  Wow!  So you had dropped out of school by then, right?]  I had 
dropped out of school when I was thirteen, and I worked in a variety store [E:  ahmm] on the 
corner of Market and uh, Dutton Street.  It use to (--)  There's a gasoline station now.  It use to be
a building there and it use to be a variety store.  And they sold everything, food, tobacco, 
anything you wanted to buy.  That sort of thing.  And I worked there for quite a few years.  And 
then I went to work in uh, Hosiery.  [E:  A huh.]  It use to be the Hub Hosiery in back of Pollards 
on uh, Middle Street.  And then Sunday's we use to work for the uh, for the Confectionary Store.
E:  Oh!  So you were busy?
J:  Well, it was a little extra money [E:  Yeah!].  The money part, because we were a big family 
and there was always the need for money.  [E:  Nine girls and one boy]  Yeah!  [E:  Roy was the 
baby?]  No, there was two sisters after my brother.  [E:  Where are you in this range]  I'm the 
oldest of the family.  [E:  A huh!]  And my sister, it was next to me, and then the others are all 
younger.  And uh, about talking about work (--)  Now we went to work in the, in the Hub 
Hosiery, which was nice.  And my sister and I both worked in the Hub Hosiery.  It was a nice 
place to work in.  [E:  What kind of place was it?]  It was a very nice clean place.  We made a 
children's [unclear] stockings all white.  [E:  Oh!]  Yeah.  And it was, it was an odd thing.  They 
use to have these round things.  They called them transfers with little points.  And you set in the, 
the uh, the stocking because it was loose, and then they, you put in the machine then the machine
finished the heel and the toe.  [E:  Oh, a huh.]  Yeah!  [E:  How many years did you work there?] 
I, we worked there quite a few years.  I couldn't really tell you the exact time.  Then we moved 
and we went to Keene, New Hampshire, [E:  Oh!] because times were bad.  My father couldn't 
get work.  We had friends over there that kind of wanted my father to get there.  So we went to 
Keene, New Hampshire, and we learned show work there.  [E:  A hmm]  And we became show 
workers.  
E:  Did the whole family work in the same (--)
J:  Not really.  Uh, all my younger, younger sisters did uh (--)  It was just Connie and I, the tallest
one.  The younger sisters we were very fortunate because in Keene, New Hampshire there was 
some very nice Greek people, they had business.  [E:  A hmm]  And they had all the younger 
sisters that were working age in their business.  So, we all kind of got work there.  And we had 
got a nice house (--)  They gave us, somebody that cared had looked out for us.  And they gave 
us a whole house.  We had like a whole home, uh, for our family.  We just didn't rent an 
apartment.  This house was all, you know, for the family.  And they had a beautiful garden 
outside where my father worked in his garden.  And it was pleasant, it was really pleasant.  But 
be were lonesome.  [E:  Hmm.]  We were born here, all our friends were here (--)  Then the first 
year we were there, the first year I got engaged and then I got married. [E:  How old were you 
when you got engaged?]  Uh, 22.  [E:  A huh!]  I was (--)  [E: How did you meet your husband?] 
Oh!  I had met him in Lowell here in church.  [Laughing]  In church.  See I got a picture.  [E:  
Hold on.]  Oh!  Don't let me move that.  [E:  Let me get you attached]  Don't let me move that.  
E:  You can [unclear].  This is a scrapbook of, uh.
J:  Well I try to keep, uh, most of (--)  Now that's the group of ladies that worked on the, [E:  Oh! 
The quilt.] the quilt.  [E:  So this incidents from the church?]  Yeah, mostly.  [E:  A huh!] That's 
mostly.  [E:  That's nice.  Family photographs]  That's my, uh, (--) that's during Easter, our 
[unclear] they called it.  This is my daughter that we've lost [E:  Oh!  A huh!  Oh!]  [Going 
through pages]  This is my husband when he was young.  [E:  Oh!  How did you meet?]  We met 
in church like every (--)  See the early years we didn't have the choirs.  [E:  A huh!]  And we met 
in church while, uh, while uh, (--) during Easter time.  We use to have get, special get together, 
and we'd have a singing group to, uh, sing for Easter.  [E:  ahmm]  And, uh, [E:  What kind of 
songs would you sing?]  It was, uh, religious.  [E:  Religious]  Religious songs in regard to, uh,
(--)  Oh that's uh, [E:  Is that your wedding picture?]  Yeah!  That's my wedding picture.  [E:  Oh!
What a great picture.  Oh! Oh! The Gown.]  That was in my mothers's parlor.  That's my husband
in the YMCA.  He was one of the leaders.  [E:  A real muscle man.]  That's my brother.  [E:  A 
huh!  Very nice]  He's family.  [E:  Very nice family.]
E:  I love this picture.  [J:  It's an old time (--)]  Yeah!  [J:  Fifty-seven years ago.]  Yeah!  It 
reminds me of my grandparent's pictures, same type of bridal gown.
J:  It was the old type of thing, you know.  You know I have his choir in here that I wanted you to
see.  [E:  So when did he start the choir?]  Uh, gosh I forget the years.  I have a picture.  I mean 
(--)  [E:  Twenty years ago about, thirty years, forty?]  Oh!  Well he's been out of it for about 
thirty years now.  [E:  Okay!]  Yes!  Because Veto has (--)  Now, this was his first choir.  [E:  Oh! 
A huh.  What kind of work did your husband do full time?]  He was a shoe worker.  [E: Oh!]  
And he and his brother a little small business, like a variety store.  [E:  Handsome.  Where are 
you in this picture?]  I'm not in it, I sang.  [E:  Your not in it.  Oh yeah! Yeah! I (--) Oh my!]  
That's why I tell you it was an old time.  This was the first choir of the church.  [E:  Oh my!]  So 
he was with it twenty-nine years.  [E:  That's great.  What kind of musical training did he have?  
Did he just be natural?]  Not much, it was natural.  It was natural really.  It was a group of friends
that had got together and they uh, sang cause they like to sing and uh, they did things together.  
They had Greek plays and musical plays, which was, they went over very, very, good.  [E:  Like 
the play you saw the other day?]  No, no. There plays were musical.  [E:  A huh!]  Everything 
was with music.  They would sing and then even with the songs they would recite the different 
parts of the play.  It was fascinating.  We don't have any of that anymore, because of all his 
friends that he use to do all this with are all dead.  [E:  Yeah!  All gone]  So he's really the only 
one left now.  the last one died about two years ago.  And when they use to meet he'd say "Nick, 
we're the two last ones" you know.  But he's gone, and uh, (--)  So, uh, It was, I think you know, I
found it interesting and it was fun.  More fun than so we have now.  You know, we go to church 
(--)  I mean we are faithful goers.  On a Sunday we wouldn't think of not going to church.  [E:  
hmm]  If we are well, we go to church.  Here we have a key to the back gate, and we just go right
across, which is really wonderful for us.  
E:  How is the church changed over the years? 
J:  Actually, not much.  Well we've changed because right now, uh, you have to speak English as 
well as Greek.  Like half of our service is done in English.  And Father John says a lot of our 
parts of our service in Greek and in English.  [E:  A huh]  Right as soon as he finishes his Greek 
he would say it in English.  And it is really fascinating to listen to him.  But this is it, because 
half of the parish is, uh, not only non-Greek, but the children don't understand Greek. [Coughing 
in background]  So this is the thing that is changing.  [E:  Are you okay].  It's all right.  Yeah!  
This is the thing that (--)  [E:  Because the children don't understand Greek.]  Well of course not. 
The Sunday School is all taught in English.  [E:  Oh! A hmm.]  You know.  Father John (--)  [E:  
Are there a lot of families in the church?]  We have over 300.  [E:  Well that's a lot]  Yeah!  [E:  
But there not all from Lowell, right?  They come from Dracut and (--)]  Yes, that's right.  They 
come from the, uh, outskirts.  Yeah!  [Coughing in background]  But we do have a real active 
parish, though.  Very active.  [E:  Uh, Bill, {unclear} I spoke to him about it.  He's a wonderful 
person.]  Yeah!  He's nice.  [E:  Yeah!  He's a nice man, yeah!]  Bill is wonderful.  [E:  So he told 
me a little bit]  Actually, I found out people very willing to help.  They are very, very good all 
around.  [E:  A hmm]  We've been very fortunate, you know, to have such good people, and 
interested in the church, and interested in the people around them.  [E:  Yeah!]  You know, it's not
just, uh, (--)  
E:  It's more of a community than people were saying to me.  It's like they stayed as family.
J:  That's true.  That's what Father John says.  He's over thirty years in our church.  He says 
"When I came in", he says "I married the parents and now I married the children and now even 
some of the grandchildren, and I'm  baptizing their grandchildren."  So it's all his family, which 
how true it is, you know, he just came in and he followed all his life is around his church, too.  
[E:  Was he born in Greece?]  He was born in Lowell.  [E:  A huh!  In Lowell.]  Father John was 
born in Lowell.  [E:  So did he grow up in the Greek Community too?]  Oh, definitely!  [E:  
Yeah!  A huh]  And around the church.  Oh yes!  His mother was a very devoted lady to the 
church.  Very nice, yes.  No, he did, and uh, [Presvee?], his wife, was also (--)  She grew around 
the church, too.  [E:  A hmm]  But Father John belonged to the Holy Trinity.  He didn't belong to 
our parish.  [E:  Oh!  I see.]  But when, uh, he became priest, he was out in Lanson I guess.  [E:  
A hmm]  Michigan.  Is Lanson (--)  [E:  Lanson?  Yeah!]  And then he came to Lowell, and he 
stayed with us all this time.
E:  Let's switch the topic a little bit.
J:  Yes.
E:  You know what I mean?
J:  I thought we went out, yeah. 
E:  I'm just watching my watch, not to be rude, it's just that I have a dentist appointment and I 
live in Quincy and I know that I have about half another left.
J:  Well that's right, you're busy.
E:  I tell you I much rather talk to you than go to the dentist.  [Laughs]  Any day.  Uhmm just let 
me ask a little bit about the cutwork that you did.  I would be interested in, uh, knowing what the 
(--)  [J:  He's going to stay there.  No, I thought he was going to get up.]  Uh, maybe if we could 
get a piece, and then we can talk of it.  You could explain to me how exactly you do the work.  
That would be helpful.  Do you want to get one of the pieces?
J:  Yeah!  Sure.  [E:  Okay, I got to unclip you.]  Why don't you pick it up, pick one up from 
there. It will be easier for you, you're younger.  [E:  No problem.]  You're better on your feet.
E:  Whoops!  All right let's look at this piece, which is [unclear], which is pink and blue and 
purple flowers.
J:  Now, this part here (--)  All these little part here.  Now you (--)  [E:  What do you do first?]  
First, I baste around it.  [E:  Okay.]  I baste around it [E:  with cotton thread?] to make the design.
With the same thread, no, well the same thread as the (--) Well if I wanted to save the colors, I 
would use white.  But I would use the embroidery thread like I used here.  [E:  Okay.  So this is 
(--) then you use embroidery thread.  One strand?]  Yeah, one strand.  Yeah, this is special for 
cutwork.  It's a special thread.  And, uh, first we make the, like baste this around to make the 
design, to keep the design going.  Because after, when you start working with it you follow that, 
uh, basting that keeps it in place.  [E:  So the basting line gives you your outline.]  Yes!  Exactly. 
[E:  So was it printed on already?]  Oh yes, oh yes, [E:  So its printed on] it's printed and (--)
E:  So when it's sewed, it's sewed as one piece?  It doesn't come off in big bulk does it?
J:  No, no, it comes as it is.  Only it has a border, a material, this is not the edge.  It gives you 
about that much.  So when you're working on it has, I mean the material comes way out here.  
[E:  Oh, so you have something like an inch?]  Yeah an inch.  So when you're working on it you 
can have something to hold onto.  [E:  Yeah!]  And then this is cut afterwards, after you finish it 
(--) [E:  Is that where it got the name cutwork?]  Yeah!  It must be.  [E:  Yeah!]  And, uh, I never 
really studied (--)  [E:  On this side too, it's uh, there's an extra border on this side too?]  Yeah, all
around, you know [E:  Oh, oh!], like you would have, like say that much material.  So then after 
you finish you cut it.  [E:  So you cut it very close]  We have a very special embroidery scissors 
that you cut with.  Yeah!  It's special scissors that you cut.  You can't just take up, pick up a 
scissors and cut it, it won't work.  [E:  Yeah, yeah.]  And you have to be careful to cut underneath
so, uh, (--)  Because this cuts very easily.  You can cut it and then break it.  [E:  Yeah!] 
J:  So if this breaks, yeah, (--)  Cutting is very, very, very careful work, because when you're 
embroidering you go about your business, but when your cutting you have to be careful not to 
cut it, because once you cut it, it just breaks open. [E:  Yeah!]  So if you do the work like we do, 
we kind of go over it very carefully, and uh, cover it.  
E:  So, when your working on the piece then, and you draw your line to be your basting line, 
what you end up doing then is making all these small overcast stitches.
J:  It's like, uh, this is like a button hole stitch.  [E:  Yeah, I couldn't think of the name of the 
stitch, yeah!]  Yeah, it's like a button hole stitch since you do over the basting.  [E:  So when you 
pull it through, when you pull the thread through and your making a stitch, do you pull it though 
up the loop like a blanket stitch?]  Well, yeah, you do, like you just (--) you like say you (--) You 
want me to show you how?  [E:  You can explain it, if not you can show, you know (--)]  Well, 
actually, after I do the basting, I take and work on it, and I start from the inside and uh, there's a 
loop on the top, like I mean the needle has a loop.  [E:  Right!]  And I just pull my thread up and 
then [E:  each day] I come back and go to the next loop.  
E:  Make another stitch, and then you pull it through a loop.
 
J:  Yes, it's like a loop, it's like a loop.  And that's why it has the button-hole stitch.
E:  Okay, so when you pull it out and you have that little loop, you draw through the loop and 
pull it up tight.
J:  And then of course what you pull up, that's the extra thread.  [E:  Thread]  So when you go 
right back to the next point that goes inside the needle and that makes the next loop.  [E:  
Exactly]  Yeah!
E:  So it's almost like a button hole stitch.
J:  It is.  It is like a button-hole stitch.  [E:  Yeah!]  That's what it is.  It's a button-hole stitch on 
this.  [E:  It's just slow.]  [Laughing]  [E:  It just takes a while, yeah.  It's so even, you make it so 
even.]  Well, like I said, when I learned [unclear] taught me she just wouldn't let me go one stitch
out of place.  But see, this was done wrong when I first started, because this was suppose to be 
cutwork [E:  Oh!  Uh huh] and cut also.  And the way I did it I couldn't cut it afterwards, because
I had done something wrong, so I just let it be.  That's why the other one (--)  [E:  Oh, I see.]  The
other one that was finished it was more open.  See, all this is cut.
E:  So when it comes to the end of the thread then you just hide it in the thread?  I mean there are
absolutely no ends or anything on the back.
J:  No, well, when I got through, when I finished my work and I come to the end of the thread, 
what I do, I take my needle very slowly and I go in underneath the stitching [E:  Yeah!  Oh!] 
here, underneath the embroidery.  And then I pull it through maybe till about here, and then I cut 
it off.  [E:  Cut it off.]  So you don't see no edges.  [E:  So after you, after you do the flowers, 
then you do the cutting?]  Oh, when it is completely finished, yes, when it is completely finished 
you do the cutting.  [E:  Would you do the center of the flowers then with the embroidery 
scissors, too?]  Yes, it's very fine, it's very fine, it's very, very fine point.  You see it sometimes 
when they advertising, they say embroidery scissors.  [E:  Yeah!]  It's a very small scissors and 
very fine.  And if, uh, you finish this and you don't have the right scissors then your wasting your
time.  Because you need to trim it nice in order to look nice.  You see there's no raw edges or 
something.  If you don't have the right scissors then it would have all raw edges and it wouldn't 
look as neat.  [E:  No, exactly.  So you really know (--)]  Now this part here, you see this is loose.
[E:  Yeah!] This is loose.  What we do with that, when we finish the whole thing, you take and 
you run thread from here to here [E:  Yeah!] three or four times, and then you finish it.  [E:  
Uhmm]  And then you make this little loop and finish it and come here and finish it.  Most 
always is when I came as far as here I would do this.  [E:  I see.]  And then I would (--)  Because 
I would bring my thread and start again to finish this.  And when you come here it's all finished.  
[E:  I see]  Yeah.  But this is extra, this is outside of the, this is not on the material at all.  [E:  
Yeah!]  So what I did was run thread, back and forth about four times to make it thick enough [E:
Yeah!] the thickness that you want.  And then I worked it the same way with the, uh, the 
button-hole stitch, only it's loose.  [E:  I see.]  And that shows up, you know, it has that lace 
finish on the edge.  [E:  It's very nice.]  
E:  Let's look at (--)  Was it common to find, uh, this type of cutwork in Greek homes?  You 
know, when you go visiting?
 
J:  Yes, a lot of ladies did cutwork, yes, a lot of ladies.  And then some of them in the later years, 
they took the cutwork and they did it on sewing machine.  [E:  Oh!]  But he did a different type 
of work.  Of course you couldn't do this type of work, but it was finished like cutwork.  But 
whatever the piece was, it was cut, but it was done by machine.  Somebody was teaching it in 
their later years.  You probably won't find the, uh, fine work like this. [E:  Yeah!]  You probably 
won't find this, but you would find cutwork with heavier uh, stitching (--)  No, I mean heavier 
work.  
E:  Were there types of, uhmm, of embroidery that women did in Greece that were similar?
J:  I don't think the woman did too much work in Greece, [E:  Uhmm.] but now they do.  Uh, 
you're close (--)  See my little uh, Santa Claus there?  [E:  Yup.]  There's a piece under there 
you'll see (--)  [E:  Yeah, I see that, yup.]  Now that's, that was done recently.  [E:  Uh huh.]  That 
was done (--)  Well how recently?  1970.  [E:  Unclear.]  Like in 70's.  Eighteen years ago when 
we had gone to Greece a relatives gave them to us as gifts.  [E: Uhmm.]  And that's a lot, lot, lot 
of work on that.  [E:  Yeah!]  It's unbelievable, unbelievable.  And that's the same idea, but they 
do it over there, but uh, not every part of Greece, different parts of Greece.  Some parts of Greece
they do all woolen, like afghan, and they embroidered them beautifully and all that.  Other parts 
do cutwork (--)  And now where my people came from, they didn't do much embroidery.  [E:  Uh
huh!]  Yeah!  Hardly any embroidery at all.  They did little sewing and, but not fine work.
E:  So did your mother do embroidery?
J:  No, my mother just crocheted.  [E:  Crocheted]  That's all she did.  [E:  That's why she sent 
you out, to get lessons.]  Well she loved it, but she never did it.  And you realize she came here 
when she was probably 16 and she went to work in the mill.  So they didn't have much time, they
worked from six till six.  [E:  What mill did she work in?]  Uh, she worked in the Merrimack and
the Boott Mill, Appleton.  Well they use to one place to another as long as they got work, I guess,
you know.  And she always worked. She worked up till (--)  Gosh, she was 60, 63, 60 or (--) I 
think she was 60 when she retired, [E:  Hmm.] you know.  She didn't have to.  The family was 
grown and the children had gotten married.  But uh, she always worked in the mill.  Even when 
her children were growing up.  When we were all growing up, my mother was still in the mill.  
[E:  Hmm.]  Yeah!  She'd come home and every Friday she would get her pay and was cute.  
She'd bring us a box of lemon meringue with the cream on it.  She'd bring one to each one of us. 
That was our treat (--)  We waited for that like it was something very special.  She didn't have 
time to bake or anything [E:  Uhmm.]  For a woman who started out young, she was married (--) 
I was born when she was 20, and uh, she really was a great cook.  She had a big family to feed I 
guess.  [E:  Had to be.]  [Laughing]  She was a great cook, my mother was.  [E:  Okay.]  
IN MID-SENTENCE:  J:  Outgoing, she wanted us to learn anything that, you know, that was 
nice, she wanted us to learn it.  [E:  Did she teach you how to cook, too?]  No, I never learned to 
cook from my mother because I always worked.  [E:  Yeah!]  And I came home, the food was 
ready, then I got married and didn't know how to cook anything.  [E:  Boil water?]  [Laughing.]
SIDE ONE ENDS
SIDE TWO BEGINS
TAPE BEGINS WITH INTERVIEWER
 IN MID-SENTENCE:  But you know everybody's 
not interested in cutwork.  [E:  Yeah], You know.  [E: because it's too much work?].  Well I don't 
know what it is, but it's like everything else, you know, each person has their own interests.  You 
know, others like painting, others like uh, writing, everybody has their own interests.
E:  Now you had a different name for this, right?  Did you say that this one's Italian?
J:  This was Italian cutwork.  [E:  How did you know that?].  Well that's what they called it when 
I, you know, while we use to have this place in Lowell.  And uh, we use to go in often and we'd 
talked about it.  And she'd say, you know, I have this piece, it's Italian cutwork.  That's where I 
got the uh, idea.  Not that I knew it or I studied it.  I never studied, uh, [E:  Yeah!] you know, 
what it was or how it was done.  
E:  So this too had a (--)  There was one piece that had some, uh, I don't know if it was this piece 
(--) There was some print of it left.  But it was still done the same way.  [J:  Yes]  Right!  
J:  But there was one that uh, I had [unclear] myself.  [E:  yeah, I don't think they put it in]  Yeah,
that was, uh (--)  [E:  Now when you stamped yourself did they give you the pattern, or did 
somebody give you the pattern?]  Well we use to kind of take a pattern from one another.  [E:  
Yeah]  If a friend had a pattern and we liked it, like I said, we'd just put the pattern on by (--) I 
would put this pattern on and I would take a (--)  I would put my piece on top of this and I would
take a spoon and trace it with a spoon, and you wouldn't believe it how it comes out. 
E:  It must of been a certain kind of material, some kind of cotton or something?
J:  Well, we used the regular spoons and it was just amazing that it would come out, it would 
come out black of course.  But we got the design [E:  Uhhm].  And we, naturally, [E:  Did it wash
right out?]  Well we never washed it before we finished it [E:  Yeah] you know, we never washed
it.  We always worked on it and then when it was all done then we'd uh, wash it.  [E:  Unclear]  
Yes, yes.  I yes, I think it would wash when it was all done, because uh, it wasn't there anymore, 
you know.  
E:  Did you ever work on material with a group of ladies, or you basically do this work alone?
J:  No, I did this alone like morning and night.  I did this alone, mostly.  [E:  To relax?]  Yeah, 
mostly.
J:  You know in the early years when my children were young and uh, of course, when I was 
single we use to do it together.  Like my sisters and all of us would be together and we'd do it.  
But uh, when I had my children young, and I was home with them all the time, this was, this was
what I knew how to do and I did it well. [E:  How many children did you have?]  Three.  [E:  So 
this must have kept you occupied after they went to sleep, huh?]  [J:  laugh] Well they use to do 
their thing too.  They use to do their homework, you know, and all that.  So we didn't disturb 
each other, you know.  And like I said, my husband many times thanks god for good kids.  My 
daughter called me last night and uh, she talked to my son.  So they went out and bought the bed,
brought it in and put it up and that's it.  [E:  It's nice to have family close by]  Then I said, you 
know, I asked you to get me the bed.  No, she says, it's Christmas present for you now.  [E:  
Hmm, that's nice]
E:  Okay!  Are there any things that you want to add?
J:  Actually, about the cutwork, that's about all I know about.  It's like I said, the main thing is 
you can, it will not come out the same if you don't baste it.  [E:  Hmm.]  If you don't baste around
the design it will not come out the same, because it, the material is bound to be loose.  [E:  Uh 
hmm]  And it doesn't give you this, you know, form that you see, you know, this is firm.  [E: 
Then what you really mean is that if I was slim then I wouldn't come in here.]  Well no, [E:  No] 
you could use other materials.  [E:  What else could you use?  Could you use a %100 cotton?] I 
would.  Yes I would.  It's just that uh, as long as the material is solid and it doesn't pull, you 
know, torn loose.  Yeah it's got to be solid.  But that's what really uh, that's what really keeps it 
together.  I've seen a lady do it, uh, she came to arewel Cuts downstairs with us.  And she was 
doing a table cloth and she was doing it, she was just stitching it.  She was doing it right, but she 
wasn't basting it.  [E:  Yup]  So when she got through, it was just loose [E:  Yeah] and it wasn't 
firm [coughing].  
E:  So when you make (--)  When you have the line and you make the stitch, do you put it 
through the basting stitch, or right in front of the basting stitch?
J:  Oh!  You follow just the top of the basting stitch, like you see here.  What I do is there was a 
basting on top [E:  yeah] because this one is printed it's like two lines.  [E:  Yeah, Yeah]  So I, I 
baste at the top and then I baste at the inside also.  [E: Right]  So when I worked on it I started 
from the bottom on the, the basting and come out on the top of the basting. [E:  Oh! I got it, 
okay]  You know, that's what makes it even and firm [E:  That's easy enough]  Now if I didn't 
have the basting on that it would be curly, [E:  Uh hmm], loose [E:  kay].  That's one thing that 
uh, is uh, I guess more of the basis of the, uh, cutwork. [E:  exactly] And the rest is up to you, 
you know.  If you want to put color in [E: right] you put color [E:  uhhm].  If you don't then you 
could do it, you know.  But in the later years they were shown color.  
E:  When do you think that started, do you remember when they started putting color in? 
J:  Hmm.  It's a long time ago.  [E:  Long time ago, kay] I was married, but I don't remember 
when.  [E:  Yeah]  Yeah.  [E:  Yeah, because it was a long time ago.]  Yeah!  Well you know, I 
didn't realize we were going to come to this.  [Laughing].
