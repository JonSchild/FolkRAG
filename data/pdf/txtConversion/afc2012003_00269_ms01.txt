The “Big Top” Show Goes On  
An Oral History of Occupations Inside and Outside the Canvas Circus Tent 
 
About Robert Rawls… 
 
Robert “Bob” Rawls was born in Dixon, Illinois to Harry and Mary Rawls who were 
traveling with a show called Ayres and Kathryn Davies Circus at the time. Bob began 
performing at the early age of five, working in a rolling globe act with his father. Also at a 
very early age he and his brother, David, had a trampoline act. His mother was a tight wire 
walker and she trained him on the wire as well. As soon he could drive he was driving a 
truck over the road at night for the circus. 
 
After high school, he entered the Army and served in Vietnam. After his discharge he 
returned to the circus and performed for a while and eventually became a boss canvasman. 
Over the years he worked with several different circuses and has done just about every job 
there is to do in a circus.  
 
In part due to an accident at an early age, Bob became interested in drawing. As time moved 
on, he would draw posters for the circus and paint circus trucks. Around the age of thirty-
five he stopped performing and moved into the management end of show business and 
began painting more. He has painted for the Culpepper and Merriweather Circus, Carson 
and Barnes Circus, Kelly Miller Circus, Fisher Brothers Circus, Hoxie Brothers Circus, 
Great American Circus, King Brothers Circus, Sells and Gray Circus, Clyde Beatty Circus, 
and others.  
 
When Bob grew tired of traveling, he opened a sign painting business and settled in Mead, 
Oklahoma where he maintained the sign shop for fifteen years. Bob and his wife, Mary, 
have been married for over thirty years and have shared the circus and sign painting life. 
Bob has also served as fire chief for West Bryan County, satisfying a need to give back to 
the community which accepted him and his family.  
 
Bob and Mary have two children, David and Annie, and make their home in Mead, 
Oklahoma where Bob continues to paint, both for the circus and for his own pleasure.

My name is Tanya Finchum, along with Juliana Nykolaiszyn. We’re with 
the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at the OSU Library and 
we’re in Mead, Oklahoma, to speak with Bob Rawls. Today is July 2, 
2011. Thank you for inviting us into your home. 
 
Sure. 
 
Let’s start by having you tell us a little bit about yourself, where you 
were born, when, and then we’ll just work forward. 
 
Well, I was born in Dixon, Illinois. My mother and father were traveling 
with a show called Ayres and Kathryn Davies Circus, and they wintered 
in Dixon, Illinois. Most of my family were born in the winter, in the off 
season. I was born in June, June 8, which was an unusual thing so my 
mom had to leave the show, come back to winter quarters, have me, and 
then go back to the show. There were only two children in my family 
born in Dixon, Illinois, myself and my sister, Margaret. Those are early 
memories, vague memories of the circus. I don’t really remember a lot 
about the circus until I was four or five years old, and then I began 
performing immediately at five. 
 
Doing what? 
 
I was the kid—my dad did a rolling globe act where he juggled while 
rolling and standing on a giant ball. The finish trick was to get me to 
stand in front of the ball, he’d reach down and pick me up by my hands, 
set me on the ball, then reach down and grab me again, bring me up to 
his shoulders, set me on his shoulders, then I’d stand on his shoulders 
and we’d both stop and style. A little kid doing that brought down the 
house, usually, and that was my earliest memories of performing. But 
after that, my brother and I formed what we called the Jumping Jacks.

We were trampoline performers, and we did a double routine every day, 
twice a day, on the trampoline as well.  
 
Later on, I decided I wanted to be a tight wire walker, and so I trained to 
do that. All this training was difficult to teach somebody to perform 
professionally, but my mother was almost like a ballet teacher. I mean, 
that’s how graceful she was and how beautiful she styled, and she taught 
us all how to respect the audience. Don’t turn your back on the audience. 
No matter what’s happening in your life, you’re smiling and you’re 
having a good time. And that was the idea. And we were trained 
rigorously to do tight wire walking. You start with a low wire, about two 
feet off the ground. It’s made of steel cable and you wear small leather 
pumps so that you can feel the wire, but it’s very hard on the feet. Every 
year, before we started out, I’d spend two or three weeks working on the 
low wire and barely being able to walk because your feet were so sore 
and bruised, and that would be just before we left school.  
 
We usually left school a month early and came in a month late. We had 
to make up our lessons in advance when we left, and we had to do our 
lessons and send them in when we were coming back in. Later on, the 
school refused to do that when I was in high school, and my folks left us 
with people so that we could finish school. Then we joined the show as 
soon as we got out of school. But that was always hard on my folks. It 
was better if they could take us with them because we did, like, eleven 
acts and that’s almost a whole circus. You throw in a few animals and 
you’ve got a whole circus. In fact, there was a fellow later on that did it 
on Fairyland Circus. We were about the only people on the show, other 
than the animal handlers, and we did eleven acts. They made up a 
program with all of our pictures on it and all that, and we used to stand 
and sign autographs at the end of the show on the pictures. It just was an 
odd place to grow up. It had its inherent dangers, but I wouldn’t trade it 
for anything on earth.  
 
Later on, my senior trip was to Vietnam, and my brother and I both went 
to Vietnam, and I believe that we survived it because of our skills and 
our abilities that we learned and the hardships that we went through in 
show business. My brother had three squads that all were killed or 
wounded in Vietnam. He was about the sole survivor. I give that as a 
testament to his earlier life. He just knew when to duck, he knew how to 
be faster, he knew what line to get in and what line to get out of and I 
did the same thing. I think that it really served us well when we went 
back. We got back from Vietnam, all we wanted to do was get back in 
show business, and we did.  
 
When I was eight years old, I had an accident on the circus. It was about 
the time of my birthday, because I remember I had a quarter in my shoe,

but the horse act had bought a new horse, and the horse was a rodeo 
trained horse, to rope, calf roping. I was going to be the cow that day. So 
he roped me and tied the rope off to the saddle horn just like the cowboy 
would do, and he jumped off to come over and tie me up like a cow. 
Well, the horse got scared. It was unfamiliar with the territory. We were 
right in the back yard of the tent circus, and it took off running. Well, I 
got the rope off of me all the way to here (gestures to his shoulders) 
when another horse stepped on me and the rope went around my neck 
and the horse drug me for several blocks. My dad actually outran the 
horse and stopped it. They didn’t give me much for my chances. They 
told my folks I wouldn’t make it through the night.  
 
I spent three years in and out of hospitals with operations down in 
Houston, in the Shrine Hospital and the Texas Children’s Hospital, 
where they rebuilt my throat and put my neck back together. I came 
back and the only thing I wanted to do was get back in the show 
business. I became a performer, seriously, after that accident. But circus 
always had dangers. My brother was clawed by lions. I always had to 
feed some of the caged animals and that’s a dangerous job for a young 
guy, to feed a tiger or a baboon or a chimpanzee or a lion, but we did it. 
There was a deal in circus business that you sign on to be such and such, 
but you make yourself generally useful in all departments. Whatever 
happened to the circus as a whole, it affected everybody. If there was a 
storm coming, everybody was out there. If the tent got blown down and 
ripped up, everybody went out there and sewed the tent back up so that 
we could get back with our business.  
 
It’s a tight knit group on a circus. It’s a small town that moves to small 
towns around the country. We’ve probably been in almost every state in 
the union, most of Canada. We spent a lot of time in Canada, because 
Canada doesn’t have a lot of entertainment so circuses were a big deal in 
Canada. I’ve been all the way up to Northern Quebec with the shows. I 
know how to put up a tent and take it down, any size tent you want. I’ve 
put up some of the largest tents in America. When I worked with 
Popcorn [the Clown], I was the boss canvasman. The boss canvasman 
was in charge of putting up the big top and all the seating that went 
inside of it. I had a crew of about forty guys, and we put up a tent that 
was probably one hundred and twenty feet wide and three hundred and 
eighty feet long. It was a huge tent. I also put up the tent for Clyde 
Beatty-Cole Brothers. It was a little different type of tent. It was a bale 
ring top. A bale ring top, they set up the center poles first, they spread 
the canvas all around the bale ring top, and then they pull it up like a 
giant curtain on the poles. That’s a bale ring top. It’s a completely 
different affair than a push pole top. Most of the tents you see are push 
poles.

And how long would it take to put one up? 
 
It would take approximately two or three hours to put it up if you had a 
good crew, and it would take about an hour and a half to tear it down. It 
was much faster coming down than coming up. You got into such a 
routine. Everybody had his little job and you just kind of oversaw that 
all those jobs were done and done safely. We lost a lot of people putting 
up tents.  
 
I remember one day on Royal Brothers Circus, in Canada—when they 
get a push pole tent up in the air, they have a jigger line that runs across 
the top of the center poles and down each end to secure those poles, and 
they’re hooked to pulleys on a dead man’s stakeout on each end of the 
tent, just to pull it tight to make it safe. In Canada, we pulled the tent up, 
and they didn’t check overhead before they put the tent up. That’s the 
first thing you always do, is check overhead. The tent pole hit a high 
tension wire, a high power line, seven hundred and fifty thousand volts. 
The boss canvasman was a good friend of mine, Bob. Big Bob Rayburn 
was his name. His son was on the other end of the jigger line, and when 
he pulled that jigger line tight, it hit that power line and seven hundred 
and fifty thousand volts went down into the poles and down that jigger 
line. His son was electrocuted instantly, but was still standing when Big 
Bob ran the length of the tent and dove at him and put his hand right at 
his chest to knock him off of that thing. It was way too late by then. It 
was over by then, but when Bob touched him, he was electrocuted 
instantly as well.  
 
There are a lot of stories like that around the show, and we’ve lost a lot 
of people along the way because of mistakes. There are some you can’t 
predict and some you can’t get around and some you should have. But 
it’s a dangerous, dangerous occupation. No matter what you’re doing 
around the show, it can be dangerous. But we all look out for each other. 
My mom had eight kids all together, but six kids most of the time, and 
we scattered all over the lot. Everybody knew us. If we were doing 
something wrong, everybody had the right to correct us. It was a big 
family and everybody watched out.  
 
When I was three, I got bitten by a bear, and this is almost prior to my 
memory. I still have the scars on my rump, but the bear wouldn’t let me 
go. They had tied the bear out under a truck to clean out his cage and I 
didn’t know he was there. I was walking around the big top and the bear 
got me. He just bit into my rump and was shaking me around like a rag 
doll. They took a sledgehammer to the bear to get him to let go. Bears 
can be really dangerous. He let go and I survived that one, too. I 
survived all these things as it goes along, and all I really wanted to do 
was get back to show business whenever I was hurt. I just wanted to get

back into show business. I loved being a performer. But you can only do 
that sort of thing for so long.  
 
At about thirty-five, I was worn out bad. My legs were gone, my knees 
were gone. I’d had multiple injuries from the tight wire and from 
trampoline. I finally got out of that and got into the management-end of 
show business, and more of the painting-end. I was always an artist. 
When I got my neck broke, I couldn’t talk for a long time, and they gave 
me a Magic Slate so I would talk with the—do you remember the old 
Magic Slate? I would talk with the Magic Slate, but I’d also draw 
pictures. If I couldn’t write what I wanted to say, I’d draw a picture of it, 
and that’s where I started doing my artwork. From then on, everybody 
would always see me drawing. Well, “If you’re an artist, well, you can 
paint this rigging here or you can paint this truck here.” I always got 
those jobs, and that’s how I evolved into a circus painter.  
 
I took that knowledge and came here [to Mead, Oklahoma], bought that 
little house up there, and decided I was going to get off the road for a 
while. I opened up a sign shop, and I just went up and down the highway 
selling signs for ten dollars a sign or whatever. I’ve maintained a sign 
shop for thirty years here, but we always went back to the circus and 
worked on the circus. My wife, like I say, my present wife worked on 
the circus with me as the secretary to the owner. I was the manager at 
the time so we were very busy all the time.  
 
We have two children who lived in a little trailer behind us, in number 
eleven, here. They would park right behind that every day, and the 
clowns would come out of their little sleepers and they would check on 
my kids because we were doing our jobs and we were on the lot, and so 
the kids pretty much were left to fare on their own. They had strict rules 
and regulations, and if they stepped out of that, we knew about it. 
Somebody told us so we would keep track of them that way. If we got a 
five minute break, we’d go in and check on them, but for the most part, 
they were on their own, and they traveled with us at night. We’d get 
them in the truck and trailer and head off. They would be in the back, in 
the crib, or whatever, and they were raised pretty much out there on the 
circus. I’ve got a picture of my daughter at the age of three, watering an 
elephant. And she loved it. She loved it. Both my kids really liked show 
business.  
 
My son went back, later on, and became an elephant handler with the 
Kelly Miller Circus for two or three years before he decided to join the 
army. Right now, he’s in Iraq and has got four weeks left of his second 
tour and we are really looking forward to his return. My daughter is in 
New York. Her husband is a major in the army and he is leaving on the 
17th of July for Afghanistan. He’s been over there four times and

received the bronze star already. We’re pretty proud of both of them. 
They’re doing a great job. I’ll just be glad when they get him out of Iraq 
this time. I think it has been more dangerous this tour than any tour, 
because they’ve made them noncombatants.  
 
My ability to manage people and deal with people and deal with the 
public, kind of lent itself to being in a community, which I’ve never 
done before in my life. When I came here, we started the sign shop. I 
also became the fire chief for West Bryan County, I guess because I had 
a way with people more than anything, and I wanted to give something 
back. I wanted to be a part of the community, and I wanted to give 
something to the community so I became fire chief and was fire chief for 
many years here, and fought fires whenever I was in town. Now, in the 
wintertime, I was usually in Florida painting circuses or something like 
that. 
 
We took sabbaticals. A year here, two years there, where we’d just be 
here, making sure our kids got an education. They worked with us in the 
sign shop. We all worked together. It was a way to have children without 
having to put them in daycare or have somebody else raise them or have 
them on their own. They just stayed with us all the time, no matter what 
we did. And because of that, I think that they’re a little more well 
versed. My son fits in real well in Iraq, in a place where people don’t 
know how to construct or run electricity or things like that. David’s 
pretty well versed in that so you can do that. He’s also well versed in 
being uncomfortable and working hard and seven days a week and all 
hours of the day and night. I think this stands him in good stead. I have 
faith in him very much because of his background, even the short 
background that he had in the circus.  
 
When I was a kid, there were hundreds of circuses running across this 
country, all in canvas tents. In the wintertime, we’d take those tents out 
and we’d boil paraffin wax, we’d take large mops and we’d mop the top 
of the tent with wax. That made it waterproof and let the rain shed off of 
the tent. It also made it a torch. You probably heard about the fire in 
Hartford, Connecticut, where the Ringling show set up their tent, the fire 
got started, and the tent just went up instantly. It was an old canvas tent 
that they’d paraffined. A lot of people got killed that day. It would never 
happen anymore because, first of all, all tents now are made of vinyl, 
and they all have chemical put on them so that they’re fireproof. But 
even still today, I’ve taken Clyde Beatty into Connecticut, and we have 
to surround that tent with a charged water line and have eight firemen on 
duty all day long while we’re showing in Connecticut, because of that 
fire.  
 
That was my job on the circus. Not only did I have to handle any of the

problems with the performers—and there weren’t that many, because 
performers know what they’re doing in show business. You park your 
trailer, you get your equipment up, and you do your job. No matter what, 
you do your job. But my job was to handle their complaints, make sure 
that they were all comfortable and had what they needed, water and 
lights and all this stuff. It was also my job to liaison with the town folk. 
On Clyde Beatty, we play Queens, we play New London, we play all the 
big towns up and down the East Coast, so there were always four or five 
inspectors that would come out and want to see, inspect everything that 
you’re doing, the concession stand and all that. Well, all these 
departments knew what they were supposed to do. It was my job to take 
these guys around and point out, “Yes, we are doing, we are complying, 
we are…” because we’re inspected more than anybody.  
 
When you come in and you’ve got an inspector from a local town—now, 
if he goes into a local café, he might have a problem shutting them 
down, but he wouldn’t have any problem at all shutting the circus down, 
because he doesn’t know any of us. You had to be very careful and 
handle these people with kid gloves. We’ve handled some very large 
operations, some serious operations with Clyde Beatty. All the trucks 
had to get on the lot. You couldn’t be without one truck. If one truck 
broke down, you had to go back and get it somehow and get it to the lot. 
These were all of my jobs. Then I would report to the owner, who 
showed up every now and then. (Laughs) But I enjoyed the job of 
manager. I enjoyed it. I thought it was challenging. We did black ties 
and things like that all over the country and were always doing 
television, TV interviews and TV people coming and spending weeks 
with a show.  
 
They did it on my family twice. There was a program called Discovery 
67, it was a PBS program. They spent two weeks with the show filming, 
and they rode in the cars and the trucks with us at night, and everything. 
They stayed right with us the whole time, and they did a program. 
Another one, later on, was something like 1, 2, 3. It was a PBS program, 
too. I’ve got that video over here, but they just live with the show and 
photograph and film us while we’re working. We got used to it. You 
didn’t pay any attention to it. I remember on Carson and Barnes when I 
was the boss canvasman, we had a Coors, I believe it was—not sure 
whether it was Coors or Budweiser—come out to do a commercial on 
the show. They wanted to catch the burly roustabouts pulling that canvas 
when the sun came up. Then, after that—no, it was Miller Time—after 
that, it was Miller Time and you go have your beer. They’d have these 
big tubs of beer and all that stuff.  
 
Of course, Popcorn [the Clown] was on the show at that time, and I 
remember having to set—they said, “You need to be at the next lot, you

need to raise the tent right as the sun is coming up.” Well, in order to do 
that, I had to send the stake truck and a crew over early and put all the 
stakes down on the pins over there. Then when the show finally did 
arrive, we’d spread the canvas that night. Instead of going to sleep, we 
spread it that night, and as the sun came up, here goes the tent, up in the 
air. Well, as I’m going up with the tent and the sun’s coming up, these 
TV people drive up and say, “We’re a little late. Can you take it down 
and do it again?” And we did. We took it all down and put it all back up 
again for a TV commercial. It’s enough to drive you crazy. Especially 
when everything’s as tight as it is around the show, but these were just 
things that happened all the time. Driving truck, everybody had to drive 
a truck. That’s one of my earliest memories. As soon as I got my license 
I was driving a truck over the road at night. 
 
A semi? 
 
Yes, later on it was a semi. I drove number—this is number eleven here. 
I drove number sixteen. Sixteen was a support truck for this truck, and 
sixteen was all the supplies. Popcorn boxes, snow cone cups, Coca-Cola 
syrup, peanuts, popcorn, everything was in number eleven, and the 
concession manager’s office was in number eleven. It parked right 
behind—not number eleven, number sixteen—it parked right behind 
number eleven so that they could ferry all that stuff right into the wagon 
during performances when they needed it. I drove number sixteen for 
several years. They used to get mad at me. My dad was concession 
manager for a while, and that was his office I was driving and all of his 
supplies and everything. If I didn’t do it correctly, why all that stuff was 
on the floor when he walked in, in the morning, and that was a mess. But 
driving truck, I never did like driving truck, but it was just part of the 
deal. You work all day and you drive truck all night, and that’s the way 
it was. I’m sure it was dangerous. It certainly caused a lot of accidents.  
 
I remember many accidents on the circus, but there were some trucks 
that were more difficult than others. If you’re carrying, for instance, I 
drove the elephant truck on Royal Brothers Circus, in Quebec. Well, in 
Quebec, they don’t have highways. They have dirt roads, and so you’re 
driving these trucks full of elephants in the backwoods. I remember one 
night having a problem and the truck backed down and half of the truck 
was hanging over a precipice and a French guy—they’re all French in 
Quebec—stops with his truck and says, “Can I help you?” And I said, 
“Well, sure.” He was speaking French and we were trying to work it out. 
I said, “I’ve got a problem. I’m over here, maybe you can pull me off 
this precipice with a chain or something. I’ll get a chain.” He walks back 
there and the truck is sitting there rocking like this (gestures going back 
and forth) on the precipice. He points to the truck and asks me what’s in 
it and I said, “Elephante.” There were three elephants in there and he

just shook his head, got in his truck, and drove off. (Laughs)  
 
There are many occasions you have to empty those elephants out of that 
truck and get that truck where it needs to be and then put the elephants 
back in. You have to have enough wherewithal to do that, because 
elephants are very dangerous animals. For the most part they’re 
domesticated, but an animal is an animal. It doesn’t have human traits, it 
doesn’t think like a human, and when you cage it and take it out of its 
environment, it can do anything at any time. I’ve seen animals respond, 
what looks like bad behavior, it’s not. It’s just a defense. I’ve seen 
elephants rampage and squash cars and throw people around, but it’s a 
defense mechanism. You’ve got that elephant where it normally 
shouldn’t be. Elephants are very smart creatures. They know their 
handlers. They know who’s supposed to be there. They know what 
condition they’re supposed to be in. They know where the food’s at. 
They know if there’s food in your pocket.  
 
On many occasions, my wife would send cookies to my son out there 
working the elephants, and he’d stick them in his pocket while he was 
working the elephants, and they’d find the cookies in the pocket. With 
their little trunk, they’d sniff around and they’d find those cookies. An 
elephant’s a very intelligent creature. I always had a great deal of respect 
for elephants, but they are animals. All of them are animals. I’ve seen 
tigers tear people up. I’ve seen elephants tear people up. I’ve seen a lot 
of that sort of stuff, but mostly because of something stupid, something 
that was out of line. I know I’ve seen drunks come up and try to play 
with them, “Oh, here’s a peanut for the elephant,” and just irritate the 
heck out of the elephant until the elephant gets enough, just picks him 
up, and just throws him somewhere. They can kill you so we try to keep 
people away from things like that. The handler that’s supposed to be 
with that elephant should always be there and you’ll avoid a lot of that.  
 
It has changed a lot, but you have all these elephants in America, I mean, 
all these animals. At least they have a place where they’re utilized. Now, 
in my day, it was thirty thousand dollars to buy an elephant so you didn’t 
do anything to hurt that elephant. They’re impossible to get. You can’t 
even import them anymore. Elephants have to be born in this country if 
there are new elephants in this country. But the circus always gave the 
elephant a place to be, and he got his feed, he got his water, he was 
washed and scrubbed, and he did his act every day. To me, it was kind 
of like how humans and animals can inter-react with each other, and I 
think it worked very well.  
 
There were many cases in the early days of people mistreating animals 
around circuses, but I don’t think you’d ever find that today. Even 
though PETA says it happens all the time, “Just to have an elephant in

the circus is harmful to the animal.” Well, what happens if you don’t? 
Where does the elephant go? What are you going to do with an 
elephant? Because there’s only one or two sanctuaries that I know of 
that will even take an elephant in. You have got to be careful about that. 
If you’ve got a herd of elephants, they know each other, you bring 
another elephant in, and you’ve got problems. You’ve got to be careful 
about things like that.  
 
Before we move from the trucks, do you want to tell about the 
numbering? 
 
Oh, sure. Sure. Yes. This is a model of the truck that I used to do, and 
the lettering and everything has been reproduced just exactly the way I 
did it. There are numbers on the back and the front of each truck, and 
these numbers signify what the truck is, what its job is, and where it 
goes and its position on the lot. When you refer to this truck—this is the 
office truck—but they’d say, “Oh, go to the office,” you could 
understand that, or they’d say, “Go to thirty-three,” which that is the 
number of the office. I know most of the truck numbers of most of the 
shows in the country, the ones that are still going, because I painted 
them. 
 
How did the numbering get started? 
 
Well, it got started on the Ringling show. When the train came into 
town, they’d have all these wagons on the flat beds on the train, and 
they’d have to take the wagons off and move them to the auditorium or 
field, wherever they were setting up or whatever. They numbered these 
trailers because there were many of them. There were sixty, seventy of 
these things, and they numbered these things so that the men would 
know exactly where to take that unit off of the train and to its location to 
do its job.  
 
Could you talk a little bit about the process of painting a truck? Does 
the circus come to you with an idea? 
 
Not anymore. Usually, I’m so well known that they say, “Okay, this is 
what we’d like to see,” the basic. They give me a general idea of what 
they’d like to see and then I take it from there. Some circuses are really 
particular. For instance, Kelly Miller is an all red circus. All the trucks 
are red so that limits what kind of color you can put on that truck. These 
are white trucks. They were easy, because you could put any color you 
wanted, it came right back at you vibrant and clear and shiny, but 
painting a truck was one of the cheapest things a show owner could do 
to refurbish his show. Every winter they repainted. All these trucks all 
went through a barn, and they all got spray painted white. Then they

were lined up at another barn, three at a time—they were big barns—
three at a time. I would set scaffolding all the way around them so that I 
could walk at the height that I needed to paint all the way around, and 
I’d paint them just as fast as I could paint them. I would paint twelve 
hours a day.  
 
You start out with a blank slate, like this, and you pop lines all the way 
across there in order to lay everything out. Then you come back with 
charcoal and you lay out the letters, get them all drawn in there exactly 
as you want them, the circles, and the scrollwork. Some people made 
patterns and did this (gestures painting then moving the pattern then 
painting). I never really did that, I just did it by hand. I got to the point 
where I can throw a scroll work across the top and sides of a truck just 
by looking at it. I can say, “Well, this is the way it’s going to go,” and 
bam, bam, bam, and you can paint it. I do it all with an inch and a half 
brush. Everything that you see is done with an inch and a half brush, and 
you got really fast at it. You mixed all your paints in the mornings so 
that your big paints were there. I’d add a little linseed oil so that it 
wouldn’t dry so fast, and a little bit of thinner. Once I got a layout on 
there, I’d just pick up the red. We’d go down and do all the red, and I’d 
come back with the yellow, and do all the yellow and the blue, and 
etcetera, etcetera.  
 
These blue circles, you’d have to paint the blue circle on there first, then 
come back and do the lettering on top of it. You usually did the blue 
circles first. All the blue circles went on first, and then you come back 
and paint all the red and yellow, and the striping and all that stuff. Then 
at the end, you’d come back and letter these individual circles out, 
because they’d be dry enough to do that. I could paint a truck like this, 
sometimes, in a day, back in those days, especially if it was a white 
truck. Now, Kelly Miller’s, the difference in Kelly Miller is that 
everything has to be double coated because of the red background. 
When you put yellow on that truck, you’ve got to double coat that 
yellow. Everything that you put on there, you have to double coat. It’s 
like doing a truck twice, but I’ve been painting so long that I just look at 
a truck and say, “Okay, this is what it needs.”  
 
I paint for Culpepper and Merriweather Circus over in Hugo, and most 
of the painting that’s on that show, I’ve done it. I painted for Carson and 
Barnes over there, which is the show my brother works for right now. 
I’ve painted for, certainly, Kelly Miller, Fisher Brothers Circus, Hoxie 
Brothers Circus, Great American Circus, King Brothers Circus, Sells 
and Gray Circus, Clyde Beatty Circus, and a few dozen more thrown in 
there. These are all some of the major shows that I’ve painted for over 
the years. It’s just a certain type of art, bright and colorful with 
scrollwork and pictures. You can see, on this truck, we do a lot of

pictures, panels of the different acts and things that are on that show. 
You see people coming out and taking pictures of these all over the 
country. Wherever we go, they line up and they take all these individual 
pictures. But these would change on a yearly basis. If you changed the 
performance, you’d change all of this.  
 
Now, when you’re creating those panels, are you working from 
photographs or are you…? 
 
Usually out of my head. A lot of times I’ll do a sketch and I’ve got 
hundreds of sketches all over, sketches that I do for trucks and things. 
I’ll do a sketch and I’ll get it in my head what I want, and then I’ll just 
go up there and draw it on there. You learn to draw huge, really big 
when you’re doing elephants and lions and stuff, bursting out of the 
truck, or whatever. You just got used to it. I didn’t set up a lot of 
patterns. I’d do a small sketch and say, “Okay, that’s about the way I 
want it to look,” and I’d go and take it to the truck and draw it on there 
by hand. Some show painters use patterns, and they’d set out paper and 
they’d make little pounce patterns, and then they’d use that. But to me, 
you couldn’t do that because every truck is an individual truck. Every 
truck has different windows, different doors so you had to fit every piece 
of artwork to the individual truck. You haven’t seen one of these shows, 
have you? Kelly Miller would be my suggestion for you to actually see 
the show. It comes into Ardmore towards the end of the year, if you ever 
really wanted to see it. But you can see right there, it’s like the 
cookhouse truck has certain idiosyncrasies that you have to work with.  
 
I remember doing a truck on Culpepper where they had a vinyl awning 
that came down over the door. It was just a big flap on the truck, but it 
screwed up my layout so much. I actually went over and painted the 
vinyl awning so that when it was lying there, the whole truck looked 
symmetrical. Now, when they opened that door and the awning went up, 
it didn’t look the same, but of course, my idea was when it was going 
down the road, it had to look sharp. When Kelly Miller pulls into town 
with its six or seven semis, all red, all with beautiful pictorials and 
scrollwork and lettering all over them, you can’t miss that. In a small 
town, that’s a big deal. They pull all these trucks out to a lot and they get 
them all in their position and up the tent goes, and performances at four 
in the afternoon and eight o’clock at night. By the time the last show was 
over—that’s the funny thing about shows—you started tearing down 
when the last show started. As the last show begins, as each act is 
finished, that equipment comes out, goes into its individual owner’s 
truck or two of the owners’ trucks, and they’d load it. You’re already 
taking up stakes. Seats that aren’t necessary are removed early. You’re 
already in a process of tearing down and moving to the next town when 
the last show starts.

Constant motion. 
 
It is a constant motion. A circus has its own electrical department. It has 
its own cookhouse department. It has its own mechanic department. It 
has its own performance director and staff management. It’s all 
departmentalized and it all works like a well-oiled machine. We played 
Camp Lejeune one time with the Clyde Beatty Circus. I’m standing out 
there and there was a captain in the Marine Corps standing out there. I 
walked over to talk to him, because it was on Marine base and its all 
Marines. He had stood there for two solid hours watching us take that 
thing down. It was a Sunday afternoon and he said, “We could learn a 
lot from you people.” And I said, “You could, you could.” The only time 
in my military career that I was asked to do anything with a tent was 
when I was stationed at Fort Belvoir in Washington, D.C., and they were 
having riots in Washington, D.C. They brought in the Eighty Second 
Airborne. We had to go out as a troop and set up their tents in the middle 
of the night so that they had someplace to be when they got there.  
 
Out there at the airfield, I sort of took charge of setting up these tents 
because I could do it. I can set up their tents in five minutes. I knew 
what I was doing. That’s the only time that ever came up. I had a strange 
distinction there when I first got to Fort Belvoir, before I went to 
Vietnam, I was in riot control and we were taught to move down the 
streets. They didn’t give us loaded guns, but they gave us guns and 
bayonets, and they said, “This is the way you do it,” and we literally 
backed people down streets in Washington, D.C., during the riots. When 
I came back, I was on the other side. I was doing some of the rioting. I 
was still in the military, but I was on the other side. They were rioting 
about Kent State, at the time, and I was part of that riot. I got tear gassed 
just like everybody else, but it felt like we were doing the wrong thing 
by the time I came back. When I went over, I was just a kid. I mean, I 
looked like I might have been fifteen, and I didn’t know anything about 
politics or war or anything else. Six months in that country, that all 
changed for me. I learned a lot and I was not too happy with what I 
finally woke up and found myself in. When I got back, I was on the 
other side. We did everything we could to stop the war, and it worked. It 
worked.  
 
Well, besides painting the trucks, did you do any of the poster work? 
 
I have done a few posters. I did a lot of work like that for Clyde Beatty, 
for their marketing department. They would have a problem and they 
would come to me and say, “Well, can you give us a layout with an 
elephant in it,” or, “Can you do this and make it this way,” and I’d do a 
lot of that. I got trained in the army as a printer. I was in psychological

operations and I got trained in the army as a printer, and that training 
helped me do stuff that was camera-ready artwork. I’d never been 
formally trained except for that little training I got in the military to do 
it, but that’s where I picked it up. That’s what gave me the thirst to go 
back to school. 
 
I went to Southeastern State University, here, for two years and I loved 
it. Boy, I just thought that was—art history, I ate it up. I had no idea why 
we do all these things and why we don’t do these things. It all came to 
me as they were teaching me all this stuff and I was just fascinated. I 
was fascinated. I was not greeted very well by the other students because 
I shot up the curve and because I always wanted to know why. I want to 
know why. Let’s get into this and find out why, and so I think I was a 
bane to some of the students. Most of my professors liked me a lot, 
though, and I still maintain ties with a lot of the professors that I worked 
with at school. They taught me a lot. 
 
We understand that your grandfather painted windows. 
 
I’ll tell you the truth. 
 
Or great- grandfather? 
 
My grandfather. Both of my grandfathers painted. I think all three of 
them did. I had three. My grandfather Jack, known as the Human Fly, 
you’ve probably heard that story, Jack Williams—he had several names, 
but Jack Williams, the Human Fly. That was quite a story of itself, but 
my grandpa Willy, who’s the man that took my dad in after his dad was 
killed in Texas. He was a show guy, too, and he was killed when my dad 
was six. Well, I don’t know how my grandpa Willy got in there, but he 
picked the boy up, my dad, and sent him to Catholic school in Searcy, 
Arkansas, which changed my dad’s life tremendously. Willy paid for 
that and from then on Willy was my grandfather, and he’s the only 
grandfather I really knew. He would teach you a lot of things, but he was 
a painter, too. He would paint windows and store windows and store 
fronts, and he always taught me, he said, “If you’ve got these brushes 
and you know how to handle them, you can just take those brushes and 
go anywhere. You’ll make a living. You’ll do fine.”  
 
It was true because I stopped right here and did it. I had no clue what a 
sign man did or how signs were done or what to charge or anything else. 
I just grabbed my brushes, went down the road, and said, “Do you need 
a sign? I’ll do a sign for you.” And I learned my way. I finally went to 
work with another sign company for a year or so, and learned a lot about 
the trade. I learned enough to raise two children and send them to 
school. My daughter has gone through college in the honors program.

She did that in two years, which really blew me away. My son is still 
hoping to go to college at some point on the GI Bill. It was a way that I 
could stay with my family, my family could stay right with me, we 
worked together and we accomplished everything that way. My wife 
worked with me in the sign business and we transferred that. I’ve 
painted signs all over the place. I don’t know if you saw the mural over 
at the elementary school. There have been two or three murals over 
there. 
 
That’s on our list. We haven’t yet, but we will. 
 
That’s an interesting mural because they came to me. They were 
building this school, and they wanted something to tie it to circuses. It’s 
a brand new elementary school in Hugo. They give me this loft and they 
say, “Paint three rings of the circus,” and I did. I painted this act going 
on here, and this act going in the center ring, and this act going in the 
third ring. There are usually three rings. There were five walls and on 
the two end walls, I painted the two show owners, the biggest show 
owners in town. One of them was my brother David and the other one 
was D.R. Miller. They’re portraits. They’re on the ends, and then there’s 
this three ring circus. I don’t know what happened or who told who, but 
The Daily Oklahoman did a front page spread on it in color, which blew 
me away. It kind of made all the other artists in the state mad, I’m sure, 
because I was a complete unknown, but I did that mural.  
 
I also did a mural called “The Heritage of Hugo,” and they came to me 
and said, “We want you to do this mural on this building.” The building 
has since burned and gone away. I have a video of the mural, but I said, 
“Well, what is the heritage of Hugo?” And they said, “Well, we really 
don’t know.” I spent six weeks researching that so I could make a 
drawing of this mural. They didn’t really know what the heritage of 
Hugo was. I know more about it than most people that live in Hugo now. 
I did a huge mural for that, telling of all the little things that happened in 
Hugo’s life and how it came to be and its connection with the circus. 
 
I don’t know if you know it, you’ve heard of Ringling, Oklahoma, out 
here? Believe it or not, that’s circus oriented. There was never a circus 
there, but Ringling Brothers had wanted to move their winter quarters 
from Baraboo, Wisconsin, where it was too cold for the animals, down 
here. One of the Ringling brothers came down here. They had a 
[railroad] track that went through Ringling, Oklahoma. It wasn’t 
Ringling, then, it was nothing. He bought a bunch of land there, and he 
was going to put a circus winter quarters there for Ringling Brothers. 
Well, they never did it. It never panned out, but if you drive into 
Ringling today, you’ll see a little circus tent that says, “Welcome to 
Ringling,” and there are little flags on top of it, and that’s their claim to

show business. They never had a show there. They never saw a show 
winter there, but that’s why it’s called Ringling, Oklahoma.  
 
Hugo was always the big town for circuses, and when I grew up in 
Hugo, there were a dozen circuses that wintered in Hugo. The schools 
were oriented to it. You were never there in the summer. You were a 
student only in the winter, and you left a month early and you came back 
a month late, and the schools were fine with that, at first. That was all 
right. Now, later on, the state mandated that we couldn’t do that, but 
that’s why we particularly settled in Hugo. The banks were a little 
more—I mean, my dad would come in and sometimes he would have to 
make a loan just to get through the winter so that he could get out on the 
road. They got to know him and realized that, “He’ll pay me when he 
gets on the road,” and we always did. They had a good working 
relationship, and still do in Hugo.  
 
I think the circus people are taken in stride in Hugo. They can live 
comfortably there and raise their families there without too much. I 
remember in school being called a gypsy a few times and things like 
that, but nothing serious. They pretty much put up with us. We didn’t 
really feel part of being a student in high school or something, because 
we always left early and came late so we weren’t really a part. All these 
kids did their summer things and summer trips and we never did any of 
that. We were working all the time. It’s a little bit different, but Hugo 
was a good town to grow up in.  
 
My father actually took a job as a radio announcer at the local radio 
station in the wintertime, and they liked him a lot. He reported the news. 
In fact, he gave me a sheet of paper a few years ago where Kennedy was 
shot. He got it off the AP [Associated Press] and he was the one that 
reported that news in Hugo, when it happened, and he gave me that 
before he passed away. I still have that paper stuck somewhere of when 
Kennedy was shot, over the AP wires, but we inter-related. My mom and 
dad would take jobs in the wintertime in Hugo. They worked in a 
hardware store. They worked as a radio announcer. They did all kinds of 
things just to get through the winter.  
 
My mom was given twenty-five dollars a week, and she usually had to 
feed twelve people and maintain a house on twenty five dollars a week. 
We weren’t allowed to go to the refrigerator and have a glass of milk. 
That was completely off limits. Meals were served, you got so much, 
and if you wanted seconds, if it was a meal where we could have 
seconds, we got it. But for the most part, you never went into the kitchen 
to ask for food in between meals or anything like that. We were poor 
people, and lived most of our lives in poverty—abject poverty. We 
carried our water, we didn’t have indoor plumbing. We lived really

rough. Baths were once a week. They’d fill up a tub and they put the 
oldest kid in and then worked their way down to the youngest kid. Same 
water, same tub. Water was at a premium. I’m sure that that’s the way 
they did it in the pioneer days, for the most part. It was a different way 
to grow up.  
 
I did love performing. I loved going out there. Now, the one time that I 
didn’t like it was when my dad came to me one time and he was the 
manager at King Brothers Circus. I was working for him. I was a tight 
wire walker. I was a trampoline performer. I did rolling globe and I 
worked the sideshow. I did the barking on the sideshow and set up the 
sideshow tent and tore it down and took care of the animals. It was quite 
a bit to do. But he came to me one day and he said, “One of the clowns 
quit,” and he said, “You’re going to be a clown tomorrow.” I said, “All 
right.” I had no idea what a clown did, how to be a clown. I put on the 
makeup—I’d seen them do it—and I put on the makeup and I got myself 
an outfit. I went out and tried to be as funny as I could, and I was a flop. 
The biggest flop I ever—I said, “I hate this! I don’t want to do this 
anymore!”  
 
Then a guy named Antar Wazzan, he’s a comedian. He did an acrobatic 
act as a comedian. He came along and explained to me what a clown 
does and how a clown acts. You don’t act silly. You don’t act goofy. 
You act serious. All these mishaps that are happening to you are serious 
and you are serious about it. You climb a ladder and you fall down, 
you’ve got to make it—you really want to make it to the top of that 
ladder, and falling down, that’s just part of—and people relate to people 
getting hurt. They can see that maybe they’re not really hurt, but at the 
same time, you whack a clown and it’s just funny. You drop a clown’s 
pants, it’s funny. You were always prepared as a clown, because a clown 
is the emergency guy, too. I don’t know if Popcorn told you some of his 
stories, but I always kept a balloon in my vest. If an act went wrong, the 
program director or announcer would turn around and say, “Okay, get in 
there and fill in.” You’d go out there and blow up the balloon and pop it. 
You’d just blow it, and then you’d say, “Do you want to see it bigger?” 
and of course, they want to see it bigger. So you blow it some more until 
you’ve got it huge and then it finally popped, knocked you down, you 
fell over. That filled up five minutes while they straightened up the 
rigging over there. You always had something on you that you could run 
in there and do as a clown.  
 
I got to where I liked clowning. I was always the fool, the guy that got 
knocked around, the guy that got blown up with the dynamite, the guy 
that got run over, that was me because I was acrobatic at the time. I was 
supple enough to do that sort of thing. Popcorn was more of the boss 
clown when he worked. I never worked with Popcorn as a clown, but

we’ve done so many gags, and they’re the same gags, that we know each 
other pretty well. We know how we’d work together. Popcorn’s a very 
good clown, a very good clown. You’ll never see him work again. The 
last time he put on his makeup was the day [of] D.R. Miller’s [funeral]. 
He made national news that day, because his picture was all across the 
country.  
 
My brother was D.R. Miller’s protégé for the most part, for a long, long 
time. I think it’s kind of neat that David’s working for the circus, for 
D.R.’s circus. I think David’s needed over there, and I think he will help 
that circus survive. A lot of my family, or most of them, are out of show 
business now. David and his daughter, Sasha, are still working in show 
business. I still work in show business when I paint and all that, but I 
have a sister that’s a principal, a retired principal in Houston, who was a 
beautiful aerialist. She did beautiful work and was a tight wire walker. 
We actually had an act together for several years. She was the female 
and I was the male tight wire walker. My other sister, Margaret, who 
works in a bank over here in Calera, used to be one of the most beautiful 
aerialists I ever saw. She could fly through the air and just look beautiful 
doing anything. I mean, she was good.  
 
My brother, Michael, has a tent rental business in the area here. He rents 
all these fireworks tents that you see all over the place. He never liked 
performing so he went into concessions. He was always in concessions, 
from the time he was about six years old all the way through.  He never 
went into performing at all. My brother, Chris, went into a little bit of 
performing, but really didn’t do that. He went more for boss canvasman 
and things like that. He was kind of like the roustabout pusher, the big, 
tough guy that can push all these guys around and get it all done. But 
none of them are in show business now. Occasionally Chris will go out 
and book a town for a show, because he still does a little of that. In this 
area he’ll book, like, Madill or Kingston or any of these towns. He’ll get 
them a sponsor and get them a lot and get them set, and he does that in 
the wintertime from time to time, just as extra work. That’s about the 
only affiliation he has with shows anymore.  
 
What do you miss most about actually working on the show? 
 
Oh, I guess I got to where I was so comfortable as a manager on Clyde 
Beatty, I knew what I was doing, that by the end of the year, you would 
be able to walk out—it’s like being on a ship, I guess, but you’d walk 
out to the midway, and everything works so well, everybody got along, 
and I really enjoyed that mellowness of showmen. Show people can get 
together and have a lot of fun. They enjoy themselves. It’s like a 
reunion, I guess, anywhere else, like these homecomings and all that 
stuff, and show people do that. I like that part about show business. I

liked it when I was a performer. I liked the applause, and certainly, you 
miss things like that, but there are a lot of things I don’t miss about show 
business. There is no privacy on a circus. If you’re arguing with your 
wife, everybody knows about it. There’s just nothing that’s private on a 
circus, and that’s one of the reasons I live down here. It’s private and I 
don’t let a lot of people into my private life, because it’s something I 
protect. It’s something I’ve never had before and so I protect it.  
 
I miss a lot of things about show business. When you’re sitting there on 
the sidelines and somebody rides into the center ring on a horse and does 
these tricks and is just fantastic and the audience just loves it and the 
band’s playing, you just can’t help but say, “I want to be a part of this.” I 
still feel that, even today. My brother produced a circus for the Great 
Milwaukee Circus Parade, and it was one of the finest shows I ever saw. 
He’d only produce it for five days. He took all the equipment, got all the 
performers together, got it all up into Milwaukee, and he had me come 
with him to help put that show on. It was the finest show. They had six 
circuses there at the time. David’s was the finest show on the midway. It 
was just done so well. I just loved being a part of it.  
 
I mean, he shot cannon shots, twin cannon shots, of guys flying over the 
big top and landing in nets on opposite sides. That’s something I’ve 
never seen before in my life. When a cannon shot goes off, that 
trajectory is planned to an nth degree. When it happened in the Beatty 
show, we shot the guy down the length of the tent, right beside the 
center poles. If you get off a little bit, you’ve got rigging everywhere. It 
had to be just a precise shot at just a precise moment. These guys 
couldn’t even see their nets when they would shoot from their cannons 
on either side and land in these nets and pass each other in midair, over 
the top of the tent. It was an incredible feat! The cannon people, 
actually, a retired algebra teacher was in charge of that. He lived in a 
little, bitty tent whenever he put his cannons on. He was a retired algebra 
teacher, and he calculated that shot to the nth degree because his son was 
the other cannon guy. I’ve never seen a shot like that before.  
 
I’ve seen some wild things in show business. I took a truck load of 
elephants to Wall Street along with about three other shows. They 
gathered up this herd of elephants and they wanted the herd of elephants 
to stampede down Wall Street, and that was the shot they wanted. It was 
for a floppy disk commercial. To get an elephant to do that, to get all 
these strange elephants together, early, five o’clock in the morning on 
Wall Street, wet Wall Street down, close it off by the police, all this 
nonsense, and you’ve got all this herd of elephants and they’re all 
nervous as hell. Then they glued African ears to Asian elephants and 
they glued tusks—now, we had one elephant that had huge tusks. The 
rest of them were Asian, with small tusks, so they glued these giant tusks

onto these [Asian elephants]. All these things are strange to an elephant. 
Then you have the elephant stampede with a bunch of strange elephants 
down Wall Street, which is what you’ve taught them all their life not to 
ever do. It was an all day affair. I was totally washed out and exhausted 
by the end of the day, but we accomplished it. Somewhere in the 
archives somewhere is that commercial of those elephants charging 
down Wall Street, and they’ll never know what a struggle it was to 
actually produce that.  
 
There are hundreds and hundreds of stories. I mean, we get to talking, I 
get to talking with Popcorn, and hundreds of stories—stories of runaway 
trucks, of fires, of blow downs and tornados, and the struggles that we 
all went through. When show people get together, those stories just start 
flying and it doesn’t matter where we are. I mean, I can be with any 
show guy and we’re talking about the old days, and we all know them. 
We all heard the stories, we all know the stories and we were part of it, 
and I think it was exciting. I think it’s something that’s going to go 
away. They’ve almost regulated it out of business because you’ve got to 
remember, each state, each truck, has to be permitted, etcetera, etcetera. 
Each animal has to be permitted, health checked, and etcetera, etcetera 
and all of the people that you have to have. Nobody wants to work that 
hard. Nobody wants to work that hard. If you’re born in it, you’d know, 
you’d work that hard. If you’re not, nobody wants to do that so it’s a 
dying art. It’s going away and I’m sorry to see that. I’m sorry to see that. 
 
I’m planning to do a series of paintings. I’m sort of a realist painter. I’m 
working on trying to get it like Michelangelo’s figures of people doing 
simple things around a circus. To give you an idea of what I’m talking 
about, it’s in my sketches. Here’s one. I’m working on an idea and it’s 
just a simple picture of a guy carrying a center pole. I’m trying to work 
it out so that it is simple. I want it to be very, very simple. I’m trying to 
get that flow and that movement in there at the same time. I want to do 
everything that a guy would do around a circus, like drive a stake or tie 
off a rope or do this, carry a pole, or handle an elephant or all of the 
things that the workers do around the show. I want to reproduce that in 
painting.  
 
Do you have a lot of time that you spend dedicated to your art outside of 
sign making? 
 
Yes, yes. I always wanted to get away from sign making. Sign making is 
so boring. The biggest problem with sign making is you have to paint 
the back side the same as the front side. We finally got into the computer 
and we did a computer generated one and I hated that even worse, 
because all the signs you see now are generated by computer. I will do a 
sign now, but only from somebody that knows me, and they say, “Okay,

Rawls 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
this is what I want it to say.” “Now, leave me alone and don’t ask any 
questions and I’ll do your sign for you.” That’s the way I do my artwork. 
That’s the drawing for my grandmother in there. But I do, I take a lot of 
time now. 
 
So the focus of your art, today, it’s not just circus related? 
 
No. My art is politically related, but I also want to preserve the simple 
things around a circus, a show lot. And you’ve seen hundreds of 
pictures—my mother has hundreds of them, of people sitting in the back 
yard smoking a cigarette before they go in and do their act. These are the 
kind of things, the life that we led. I want to portray that on canvas. I 
want to do that on canvas. I don’t know that anybody would want that or 
put that in their living room or anything like that, but I want to do it, 
because at least they’ll be there. After I’m gone, they’ll still be there. So, 
yes, I do a lot of circus genre work, but I do a lot of politically motivated 
work. I do some stuff just for fun. Those are the things I’m serious 
about, and that is what I want to do. Hopefully, I’m just about getting to 
the point in my life where I can do it.  
 
And do you show your art anywhere? 
 
I have shown my art. It was published in The Southeastern Magazine, 
and I’ve done two or three shows through Southeastern College. They 
don’t like my work because it’s not a body of work, as they describe it. 
A body of work is you paint a pear, you paint a pear again, and you paint 
a pear again, and that’s a body of work. All your work should be similar, 
and I got kicked out of a couple of shows because none of my work is 
similar. I do animals, I do people, and I don’t have a body of work. It 
just jumps around too much, but I have shown in several. I have not 
made it a point to push it very much because when I’m gone, I figure my 
wife can do whatever she wants with the paintings. In the end, it might 
be a retirement, help her in her retirement or something like that.  
 
Yes, I’ve designed a studio in here and my shop out there so that I can 
find some alone time and do these paintings. And I’m going to do more 
and more. They’re all through the house. I know you’ve seen them 
everywhere, but they’re all through the house. Would I show them? 
Sure, I’d show them almost anywhere, but I just haven’t had a big 
inkling to do that. One of the problems with being an artist is that you 
have to schmooze. (Laughter) You have to go to these little dinner 
parties and you have to talk about this and you have to describe your art 
and all that. I don’t want to do that. I don’t want to do it. I can do it. I 
don’t have any trouble talking to the public about anything, but I don’t 
want to do that where my art is concerned. I want my art to speak for 
itself. Don’t ask me to describe it. Don’t ask me to enhance it some way.

Just, you like it or you don’t like it. To me, that’s the way it ought to be. 
 
Some of the same characteristics a good booking agent would have.  
 
Yes. A good booking agent’s hard to find these days, very hard to find. 
My brother David is doing that for Carson and Barnes right now. It’s a 
difficult proposition. I sat down with him and we sort of worked out a 
little plan before he took that job on how to get it under control. A lot of 
people don’t understand the logistics of a circus. It takes a great deal of 
effort and time, even in his job. A circus comes to town, he’s already 
squared the lot, he’s got the sponsor, he’s sent them the tickets, he’s set 
up the billposting and the advertising and the radio and the TV, and he’s 
done all that from that office over there. At the same time, when the 
circus leaves, you’ve got to come back. “Was the sponsor happy? Was 
the lot clean? Would you take us again next year or the year after that?” 
You have to do all of these logistics from this office to keep that thing 
out there on the road. If you don’t do that right, this is going to fall on its 
face.  
 
I’ve been on shows that didn’t make it because they just didn’t have a 
good enough, what we call the front end. It didn’t have a good front end 
and the nut is getting higher. I don’t know if you know about the nut. 
The nut is the expenses that it takes for a show to operate during the day. 
For instance, our nut on Clyde Beatty was about twenty-seven thousand 
dollars a day. We had to make that much to make any profit. The term 
comes from in the olden days when shows traveled with wagons and 
horses. When the show came into town and set up, they would buy feed 
and food for the performers and everything from the general store in 
town, and they’d say, “Well, we’ll pay you after the performance 
tonight.” Well, the merchant in town would take the nut off of the wagon 
wheel and keep it in his store until that night when they came and paid 
for the goods that they bought that day, and that’s called making the nut. 
“I have to make the nut.” That’s where that came from. There are so 
many circus sayings, it’s ridiculous! 
 
Twenty-seven thousand for one day, that’s a lot. 
 
Yes. That’s a lot of money. We had to get a lot of people through there 
all the time. It had to be full all the time. On Clyde Beatty, they did it a 
little bit different. Now, we got to where we set up for “two, two, and 
three,” is what they called it. You set up two days in this town, two days 
in this town, and three days in the weekend town. On the second day, 
after they’d seen the performance the first day, the first few people that 
came to the show, the second day was always full. It was always full and 
that’s the mark of a good performance, a good circus performance. One 
of the finest I’ve ever seen was with Clyde Beatty. When they came out 
 
 
26
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Nykolaiszyn 
 
Rawls 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of that, I was the manager. I was on the gate. I solved all the problems 
going in. “Who gets this seat? Who got messed around? Who did this? 
How much did I have to pay?”  There is all this stuff that you have to 
solve when they go in.  
 
When they came out, “Did you enjoy the show?” “I loved the show!” 
“Loved the show? Come and see it again!” and the next day the tent 
would be full, whenever you stay in a town long enough. But you’ve got 
to understand, these days, like Kelly Miller, it comes into town, at five 
o’clock in the morning they’re setting up the tent, some guy drives by 
and says, “Hey, there’s a circus out there in the field!” By the time he 
gets off work that night, it’s five o’clock, he gets his kids together, 
rounds them up, and tries to get down to the circus. Some people make 
it, but for the most part, everybody says, “Well, I’ll catch that on the 
weekend,” or, “I’ll see that tomorrow.” They’ll go to that same field the 
next day and there’s nothing there, nothing. Not even a paper popcorn 
bag.  
 
It’s difficult for town people to relate to that. I didn’t know that until I 
was a town person, and you come in. I brought shows in, and you come 
in and, geez, you just haven’t got time for that. You’ve got kids going to 
school. You’ve got a basketball game tonight. When are you going to go 
to the circus? And these days, the circus is an expensive proposition. For 
a family of four, you’d better have one hundred to one hundred and fifty 
dollars in your pocket to go to a circus, because that’s what it costs to 
operate these things, pay these people, buy your insurance, and do all the 
things necessary to make the nut. I do miss it, and yes, I do have many 
fond, fond memories of the circus, and yes, I’m still involved. 
 
Do you prefer the canvas tent circuses to the indoor circuses? 
 
The quintessential circus, to me, was under the canvas. It’s a completely 
different feel all the way around if you’re putting it up or even if you’re 
around it. It’s a completely different feel. But in those days, circuses 
were close-knit families, close-knit families. I enjoyed that. I mean, a 
Sunday afternoon in Canada, they have blue law so Sundays, you 
couldn’t show Sundays. It was the most beautiful thing I ever saw. We 
had a day off! We’d play baseball together, and we’d have picnics 
together, and we’d have cookouts together on that day off. It was great! 
It was the most wonderful thing that ever happened to a show. I thought, 
“My God, I ought to have that day off down in America, where we play 
all the time.” But there’s really no such thing as a day off in a circus. As 
a manager, I hated a day off because all these people get off for a day 
and you’ve got to put it all back together the next day. They’re all kind 
of worn out from being tired of doing whatever entertainment that they 
wanted to do for that day off. I always dreaded days off on Clyde Beatty.

But back in the old days, it was a lot slower. There were gravel roads. 
The trips over were slower, the actual jump, what they call the jump, 
which was from one lot to the next, was usually short, thirty, thirty-five 
miles at most, and you’d get in, and you’d set up. When I was a kid, I 
loved it because we’d come in and heck, the lot, we’d always be waiting 
to see what the lot was, because it could be a fairgrounds. That was 
always great. We could explore the grandstands. We could explore the 
old barns. We could do this, or if it was a nice grassy park area or 
something like that, or there was a swimming pool next door. I mean, 
every day was a new adventure, a new place, a new town and you’d try 
to make the most out of that. When you hit the lot, you did your chores 
as fast as you could so that you could go explore, get away, go explore 
the woods or the creek down there or the pond over there. We did a lot 
of that, and yes, I loved that part of show business.  
 
We weren’t treated too badly. Now, there were places where we went in 
as kids, dime stores and stuff and they’d say, “You with that circus?” 
And we’d say, “Yes, sir.” We were always taught to say, “Yes, sir,” 
“No, sir,” because we had to be on our best behavior, always, when we 
were around town people, and I’d say, “Yes, sir,” and they’d say, “Well, 
get out of here. We don’t want you in here stealing our stuff,” things like 
that. That happens anywhere you go with anything you do. It was always 
neat to see because they’d bring school kids out in buses and troop them 
around the tent and show as you’re going up, and we were always just as 
curious about these kids as they were about us.  
 
People would have a tendency, I mean, you’d be in your trailer, and 
people would have a tendency to come and open your screen door on 
your trailer to see what you were doing, because they thought it was part 
of the circus. You’re supposed to be in there in make-up, juggling or 
something like that. That privacy issue was always a problem with me. I 
always didn’t like that, but there were so many things about the circus 
that I did like a lot, and good people. Good people that would go a long 
ways to help you or do for you and you could find that anywhere in the 
country in the old days. You could find show people in Florida or Texas 
or Oklahoma. You knew where they were. If you were down on your 
luck, you needed a stake, they’d do it. They’d do it. They’d say, “Come 
back in the spring. I’ll have a job for you.” Things like that.  
 
Do you have memories of the Modern Trailer Park in Hugo? Living 
beside it? 
 
Yes, I sure do.  
 
Can you share with us?

I lived down there for a long time. We lived in a little trailer there with 
several other circus folk people that lived there, and I grew up with their 
kids. We would actually share responsibility of the kids. My mom would 
watch your kids. Your mom would watch her kids and all of that stuff in 
the trailer park. And we all knew each other. We were all show people, 
going out on different shows, but in the wintertime, we knew, I mean, 
we could talk to each other. We were show people, and yes, I have fond 
memories. The first house I ever remember living in, other than in 
Macks Creek, was a little house that was in the middle of that trailer 
park. My dad rented it one year and that’s where we lived, in that trailer 
park. It was in a little house. That’s the first house I really remember 
living in.  
 
There were a lot of fond memories of Hugo because there were so many 
show people and because the town people inter-related with us, 
correlated with us. It wasn’t a problem that we were with the circus. My 
brother was probably one of the most popular kids in school. He played 
football, was top honors everywhere, and everybody liked him. I wasn’t 
so much. Because of my accident, I wasn’t there a lot. I had like three 
years where I was completely out of the picture, and so it was a little 
different for me. But most of my family were received very well in 
Hugo and lived comfortably there, on next to nothing. It’s a great little 
town. I always like going back to Hugo. I always feel like some sort of a 
little bit of celebrity, going back to Hugo, because I know everybody 
and everybody knows me, and we get along real well.  
 
Usually, I’m doing some sort of art project over there. I worked on a 
project in the new library there, and I painted little pictures of animals 
around the ring curb in the library. They had a circus wagon put up 
there, in the kids’ section, and I did all the scrollwork and painting on it. 
I don’t know if you got a chance to see that, but that was one of the last 
projects I did for the town. I’ve done several murals and several 
paintings. On Angie’s Circus City Diner, I did all the artwork for their 
menus and their signs and all that stuff. A lot of my artwork is in 
pictures inside that place. That’s where I eat lunch every day when I’m 
painting over there. Margaret, the waitress over there, knows me so well, 
I come in at 11:15, she has my lunch sitting right there, my coffee sitting 
right there, I get my stuff, and I’m back at work in fifteen minutes. She 
knows me very well. It’s the little things about Hugo that make it neat.  
 
I know everybody out at Showmen’s Rest. I think I know just about 
everybody that’s buried out at Showmen’s Rest. A lot of them are my 
relatives and my friends. Most of those people are dead. I’m really sorry 
to see this form of entertainment begin to fade out from American life, 
because it’s an American story like no other, I think. There’s a picture

somewhere of my mom and dad. My mom’s in her tight wire costume, 
my dad’s dressed as a clown, and all of us kids are strung out in front of 
them, and one of them is on her hip, and it’s a black and white 
photograph. I always wanted to send that to Ken Burns for the American 
Experience. That photograph’s all I’d have to show him and he could 
take it from there, because there’s just such a big story to be told. My 
mother’s story is like a miracle, and she just went through heart surgery.  
 
We found out the other day that she’d had this heart problem all her life. 
I remember taking her down when she was hung up in rigging where 
she’d passed out because of this condition right here, and you’d have to 
take the rigging down and remove her from the rigging. She had strokes 
over this and she lived this all of her life, raised all these kids, did all this 
performing and just towards the end of her life, she finds out she has a 
severe heart problem that’s been with her since she was a child. It’s 
incredible, incredible what she did. I just, I don’t know another woman 
on earth that could do what she did. When I got married, I said, “I want a 
woman that can do something like my momma.” (Laughs) And I 
married Mary. She happened to be named Mary. It just happened that 
way, but we’ve been together thirty years. I keep telling her, as soon as I 
find somebody better, she’s out of here, but haven’t done that yet. 
(Laughter) She’s quite a woman, too, and I wish I’d have known her 
earlier in my performing career, because I think she would have been 
good at it. She’d have been very good at it. 
 
You’ve got to have special memories of performing with your mother, 
then? 
 
Oh, yes. I remember my mother walking a tight wire when she was six 
months pregnant, walking on a tight wire. Oh, yes. I have fond 
memories of that, my father, not quite as fond. My father was a great 
man, but the tactics that they used to train children in show business are 
rough. They’re rough. I remember when we first—I’d never seen a 
trampoline before and all of a sudden we’re supposed to be trampoline 
performers. Well, in order to teach you how to do that trick—because 
you’re a kid, you’re scared—halfway through the trick, you’re going to 
do what they call balking, which is, “I’m afraid to do this trick and I 
can’t do it,” and you usually wind up getting hurt. My uncle would stand 
over here and my dad would stand over here and they both had leather 
belts. They said, “Okay. Now, you’re going to do this trick, or you’re 
going to get wailed,” and you did the trick, and that’s the way we 
learned. That’s the way all family kids learned.  
 
The tumblers, you’d see them in the back yard with their kids, teaching 
them how to tumble. If they didn’t do the trick, they got whacked for it. 
That was the way it was. It didn’t mean your folks didn’t love you. It

meant that you were part of the support of this family and you had a 
responsibility. That started at about age five and so you did that. I never 
held it against my folks for training me that way or putting me in those 
situations. I wanted eagerly to be a part of that, and I would go through 
what anybody else today would say, “That’s abuse.” Well, it wasn’t 
abuse. I knew farm kids that got it far worse that we did. But that’s just 
the way it was in those days, and you trained kids that way.  
 
I guarantee you, when we went to a restaurant, on the rare occasions 
when we’d go to a restaurant on a Sunday afternoon, we’d troop in there 
with six kids. The waitresses would look and say, “Oh, my God! Here it 
comes!” We’d sit there and not one of us ever made a sound. If 
somebody addressed us, it was, “Yes, sir,” “No, sir,” “Yes, ma’am,” 
“No, ma’am,” but we never made a sound. My dad said, “He’ll have a 
hamburger, hamburger, hamburger, hamburger,” like that. If he even 
looked at you, if you were doing something naughty or something 
wrong, if he even looked at you, you were in trouble. We had to be on 
our best behavior all the time and it was drilled into us, constantly, and 
especially in front of the public. If you’re wearing wardrobe, you’re a 
performer. And I don’t care—I’ve worked with a broken ankle. I’ve 
worked with busted tendons. I’ve worked with a hundred and two fever. 
It doesn’t matter, whether it’s raining, whether it’s cold, whether it’s too 
hot. It doesn’t matter. Two shows a day, every day, and you do it, and 
you do it with a smile. That’s discipline. Most kids don’t see that kind of 
discipline, but it was the kind of discipline that saved my brother’s life 
and probably mine in Vietnam. Is there anything else I can answer? I 
probably missed a lot. There are a thousand things I could tell you, but I 
just don’t know all of the things to say. I just know that there’s so much. 
 
You actually stopped performing in your mid-thirties because of…? 
 
Because it was getting to be… 
 
…stress on the body? 
 
I mean, I’d already busted both tendons. I did a trick on the wire and at 
the finish of the wire act, I would turn to the audience, standing on the 
wire, straight toward the audience, the wire goes this way. Well, to walk 
a wire you have to keep your eye on that end of the wire while you’re 
walking. When you turn around, you immediately get your foci on this 
end of the wire. To turn toward the audience, you lose all sense of 
balance, but the final trick in the wire was I would do my finish trick, I 
would stand up, I would face the audience like this and then I would 
throw my hands up in the air and fall and my knees would catch the 
wire. I’d swing around, flop up, and end standing on my feet on the 
ground. That was always a tough trick because it cut into your tendons

every time you did it, but no matter how bad the tendons were, you had 
to do it twice the next day. If you were hurt or cut or anything, you still 
did it. You still did your act no matter what. There was no such thing as 
being sick. “I can’t put up the tent today, I’m sick,” or it’s raining cats 
and dogs out there, and Mom still sends you out there. Now, there were 
some times it was so bad that when we got in, we were so cold and wet 
and miserable, that she would feed us all a teaspoon of Old Granddad 
whiskey and put us to bed.  
 
We slept in odd places. The trailer got to be smaller and smaller and 
smaller as time went on. My dad built a little box on the back of the 
truck where my brother and I lived and it was just big enough for two 
bunks. It didn’t have any windows. It had a little door, but there was no 
door on it, just an opening, and we had two bunks in there. That’s where 
David and I lived for a long time because there just wasn’t any room in 
the trailer. Can you imagine, Mom and Dad and Grandpa and six kids, or 
eight kids? There was just no room so you spent most of your time 
outside or living nearby or something like that, and those are cool times. 
I didn’t mind it, riding in the back of trucks and things like that. It 
wasn’t too bad. You always had that anticipation of “What’s going to be 
in the next town? Who am I going to meet, what am I going to do in the 
next town?”  
 
That was always something to look forward to, and the end of the 
season, the last day of the season. That’s a big day in show business. 
People have a tendency to get silly. I know we had a flying act on the 
Beatty show and the last day they all came out, one of them was dressed 
as Batman, one of them was Superman, and they did their act dressed in 
these costumes. Other people would play little jokes on people. They 
would put jam all over their trapeze bar or they would put the wrong dog 
in the wrong box, and so the wrong dog would come out. Or they’d 
come in and carry out part of your equipment that you used for the act so 
you had to ad lib or something. There were always jokes being played 
the last day of the season, because everybody’s so happy. We’ve been 
doing this seven days a week for thirty-two solid weeks, and now we get 
to stop. We get to take it home and stop for the winter, but they’re 
always just as anxious to get out in the spring. They’re all out there 
painting their props and doing their practices and getting ready to go and 
can’t wait for opening day. So it has its ups and downs. 
 
On the very last night of the season, when you do the spec, what 
happens? 
 
Oh, people just fool with each other. They do all kinds of stuff. The 
wrong people are in the wrong lineup, and they’re just playing little 
jokes on each other, the whole time. Everybody’s laughing and joking

and playing little games and it’s kind of a neat time. Kelly Miller had 
this thing at the end of the season, it was usually in November. Well, in 
October, was Halloween. Kelly Miller always had a reputation for 
having a big Halloween party on the show, because it was three weeks 
before closing. They’d all come dressed as different characters and stuff 
like that, and they did it every year. You got to be part of a pretty 
famous tradition on Kelly Miller.  
 
Kelly Miller was a tough show at first. Marriages didn’t seem to work 
out too well on Kelly Miller. It was such a well-oiled machine that it got 
to be boring and I think, I don’t know this, but I think that made a 
problem for married couples, because a lot of marriages broke up on 
Kelly Miller for a while. Marriages that had lasted for years and years, 
they’d go on Kelly Miller and all the sudden, they’re going to get a 
divorce. It just was unbelievable, but Kelly Miller got to be such a well-
oiled machine that people could do it without even thinking about it. The 
show would be up and down and you’re in the next town, up and down 
and the next town, everything exactly the same, every day. That’ll get 
you down, and I think it got a lot of marriages down.  
 
I don’t know why that went on. It was like a three or four year period 
where everybody seemed to go over on Kelly Miller, they’d get a 
divorce, or they’d wind up—the monkey girl would be with the elephant 
guy, and all this stuff. And I think it was just because it was just too 
well-oiled of a machine. It’s one of the finest operating little shows I 
ever saw. It is still a great little circus. My brother doesn’t own it. John 
Ringling North II owns it now, and I work for John in the winter. They 
love my painting so I’ll probably be working for them for several more 
winters, until I can’t do it anymore. It’s still a great, little show. 
Whenever I get around that show and watch that show, I still get that old 
urge. I just want to get back out there and do it. 
 
Be a ringmaster, then. 
 
Yes. I did that. I was a circus announcer for a long time. I was the 
sideshow barker for a long time. I’ve done just about every job there is 
to do on a circus, much like the rest of my family. That’s nothing special 
in my family. If you’re on a circus, you might be a performer, but you 
also know how to set up a tent, to drive a stake, to operate a truck or a 
vehicle, or you know how well everything is laid out. You can do the 
twenty-four hour man job. You can do it all. We were trained to do 
everything. Whenever you’re on a circus, you were always called to do 
something outside your so-called job description.  
 
Popcorn’s the only one I ever knew that had a contract. He actually had 
a contract as a clown. I never had a contract. In all my performing days,

I’ve never had a contract. But he had a contract and he would say, 
“Look, I’m not doing that because it’s not in my contract.” But he’d be 
the only one I know that could say that, because most people didn’t have 
a contract. Most people, it was a handshake. It was, “I know you. You 
know me. Okay, you’re going to be on the show.” You don’t quit a show 
before the end of the season unless it’s just impossible. You don’t do 
that. You always stick it out through the season, and no matter what 
comes up, you have to continue on. Just like me, I got my neck broke. I 
almost died. Well, they told them I wasn’t going to live until morning. I 
fooled them, but can you imagine? Here’s your child with a broken 
neck, a crushed throat, and three years of hospital visits coming up, and 
we still have to go on with the circus. They left me in hospitals and stuff. 
It was difficult to understand that kind of stuff, to make that stuff work. 
You just sit in the hospital for months on end and nobody comes to see 
you because they’re all out there performing. They’re all out there 
working. I understood that, but it was hard. That was hard. That was the, 
I think, the darkest part of my life. You sit in a hospital, day after day, 
not knowing what operation we’re going to do next. I think I’d had 
somewhere around thirty or forty operations, major operations, and my 
parents couldn’t be there. My family couldn’t be there. That’s just the 
way it was. I always wanted to run away from the hospital. I never quite 
managed it, of course, I had a broken neck. 
 
Instead of running away to the circus. Well, you wouldn’t run away to 
the circus. (Laughs) 
 
Well, that was our saying, “I want to run away from home and join a 
circus.” Well, “I want to run away from the circus and join a home.” 
(Laughter)  
 
Anything else you want to say before we sign off? 
 
I thank you for doing this. I’ve already called my daughter and told her 
about it, I said “Someday my granddaughter may want to know and may 
go to the Library of Congress, and there will be her grandpa spouting off 
bologna about circuses.” (Laughter) 
 
Well, we appreciate you inviting us into your home today. 
 
Well, certainly, certainly. 
 
Thank you. 
 
Thank you for coming.
