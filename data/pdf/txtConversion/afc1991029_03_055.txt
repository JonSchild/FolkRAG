Introductory remarks from David Veilleux  (coordinator for
 
New England Multifunctional Resource Center for Language and
 
Culture in Education  [NEMRC]):  took him four years to be able to
 
announce job title in one breath; NEMRC is funded under Title
 
VII;  David has been working under Title VII since he's been in
 
the Saint John Valley in 1974  (Saint John Valley program);  left
 
the Valley in 1980 and "ran the unemployment boards" for about
 
three months;  then,  took position at University of Vermont for
 
seven years with the same center  (funded out of Brown University
 
in Rhode Island)  and subcontracted to Universities of Maine,
 
Connecticut,  and Massachusetts;  "I'm i
t for Maine,  New Hampshire,
 
and Vermont"  [students laugh];  involves a lot of travel
 
David Veilleux:  the NEMRC has co-sponsored many courses like
 
Education 475 over the years;
 has been sponsoring a group called
 
ESL Literacy Conferences in New England  (region encompasses all
 
six New England states);  literacy conferences started out on a
 
twice-a-year basis.  Present New England states fiscal crises
 
(e.g.  Massachusetts)  has hurt conference attendance  (from +400 in
 
1990 to about 150 delegates in 1991)  because Massachusetts would
 
not
 release any of its teachers or pay for substitutes;  also
 
told teachers that if they were absent in order to attend the
 
conference,  they would face censure in their job;  so NEMRC is
 
looking for new ways this year to reach as many people as they
 
can
 
David Veilleux:  for next two he will work closely with Gil
 
Albert to see what kinds of things NEMRC can do within the year
 
to provide students with some in-service courses and training for
 
things that students will want or need in the Valley; when he
 
began to talk to Don Bouchard at U.S.M.  [University of Southern
 
Maine],  he told him at the first meeting that folks from the
 
Valley couldn't be expected to come trotting up to U.S.M; we have
 
to go up there;  story about inviting a Title VII projects officer
 
in Washington,  D.C., who was giving him trouble about the amount
 
of money requested for travelling,  for a visit to the Valley in
 
order to get a first-hand look at why the extra funds were
 
necessary
 
David Veilleux: morning program roster;  Yvon Labbé will
 
introduce an activity which will be used as part of discussion of
 
Franco-American issues later this morning;  film "Crac" will be
 
shown; Guy Dubay will cover some of the Acadian culture
 
David Veilleux:  [later in day]  he will do some broad
 
demographic projections for United States and State of Maine
 
pertaining to second-language students in the schools
 
David Veilleux:  anecdote about report on this morning's
 
"Today Show"  [television broadcast]:  someone made the remark,  "I
 
wasn't here when they brought the slaves over so why should I pay
 
for it?"  [David Veilleux laughs;  continues]:  "It's still going
 
on,  in fact,  the whole article on the Today Show was dealing with
 
the rise of the new racism in America,  particularly aimed at
 
Blacks and Latinos.
. .
 
Yvon Labbé:  introduces himself and will be speaking later;
 
but decidedly there is a body of knowledge in this room to which
 
he would like access when he's on later;  so he proposes that
 
participants,  if they are willing,  please write down on five
 
index cards the first five words which define French-American
 
identity in Maine for them;  [cards are distributed to students];
 
cards will not be identified to individuals,  so if students have
 
anything "osé"  [daring]  or "risque"  [bold,  risque]  to add,  please
 
do;  the words should represent personal concepts,  not things
 
which have been taught the last couple of days,  "no compound
 
words or anything like that"  [David Veilleux laughs]
 
[Students fill out cards;  Gil Albert offers coffee;  somebody
 
mentions having "had a bi-lingual breakfast at Roch's"  (Roch's
 
Motel in Fort Kent); Gil Albert takes his leave;  David Veilleux
 
jokes with students and presses them to turn in their cards]
 
[Showing of film "Crac," an animated color film by Quebec
 
cineast Frédéric Bach produced in the 1980's which affectionately
 
describes,  through the experience of a wooden rocking chair,  the
 
traditional society of latter nineteenth century Quebec,  and
 
explores the dynamics of tradition and modernity in the twentieth
 
century]
 
[During film showing and Guy Dubay's presentation,  Yvon
 
Labbé goes to the adjoining classroom and writes up the results
 
of his Franco-American identity exercise]
 
David Veilleux asks students for reactions to film "Crac":
 
[Class reactions]:  the "joie de vivre,"  "any excuse for a
 
party;" film typifies the local Saint John Valley French culture
 
which the present generation growing up will never see:*
 
religious-based,  big families,  rites of passage connected with
 
religion,  logging traditions;  the ever-present snow;  family
 
involvement;  "and the thing is,  the old,  the original rocking
 
chair was so well made that it still exists,  and. .  .1 still have
 
my great grandmother's rocking chair"
 
David Veilleux points out how the film traces the change
 
from a rural agricultural to an urban industrial society; the
 
chair winds up in a dump but is taken to a museum;  the chair
 
displays its cultural heritage but hides it when the museum
 
security guard comes by on his rounds;  suggests that Franco-
Americans do the same thing  (celebrate among themselves but not
 
show their "stuff" when strangers are around);
 
[David Veilleux rewinds film;  student ask where film is
 
available;  film is available through Maine State Library;  [static
 
on tape is intermittent]
 
David Veilleux: will be discussing Franco-American present-
day realities and future possibilities;
 
David Veilleux:  begins introduction of Guy Dubay; how time
 
has passed; updates students on his own family news  (he's about
 
to become a grandfather)
 
David Veilleux introduction of Guy Dubay:  Guy is well known
 
throughout the Valley; Veilleux first became deeply interested in
 
his own culture and history through Guy's work on genealogy in
 
the Valley;  story about how Veilleux's interest in his family
 
past was catalyzed when he took a National Geographic
  
photographer,  whom he was showing around Saint Luce parish
 
[Frenchville,  Me.]  to the Frenchville graveyard and realized for
 
the first time that his own ancestors were buried there; he
 
called his mother the same night,  furious,  to find out why she
 
hadn't told him;  she didn't think he would have been interested;
 
introduces Guy who will talk about Acadian culture and history
 
Guy Dubay  [speaks on his feet,  reading from notes]:  Course
 
title has something to do with cultural diversity;  and although
 
focus of presentation will be Acadians,  course title reminds him
 
of a map  [Dubay shows students a poster-sized large-scale
 
reproduction of a map of Van Buren from the 1877 Colby and Roe
 
Atlas with hand-written title "Van Buren -
 A Multi-Ethnic
 
Heritage"]  which he put together for an earlier course; the map
 
identifies Acadian,  British,  Quebecois,  American,  and Irish
 
people in Van Buren at that time  [Dubay adjusts the map]
 
Guy Dubay:  lists landowners from map,  pointing out mixture
 
of Acadian,  Quebecois,  English,  Irish names;
 gives examples of
 
inter-marriage;
 "We tend to think of assimilation as working
 
from English to French,  but indeed the Hammonds  [my spelling],
 
the Farrells,  and the Keegans made a concerted effort at learning
 
French,  and while in ensuing generations some family members
 
retained their original non-Catholic faith,  it must be noted that
 
in 1912 the first Grand Knight in Van Buren was J.  W.  Hammond,
 
whom we also sent to the Legislature."
 discusses history of the
 
Hammond family;
 "The point I want to make by the use of the map
 
is to indicate while peoples of different cultures attended
 
different churches on Sunday,  on Monday,  Tuesday,  Wednesday,
 
Thursday,  Friday they didn't exactly ignore each other."
 Later
 
historians,  writing to suit contemporary biases,  would have us
 
believe that the various cultures of the St.  John Valley lived at
 
odds with each other,  but documentation shows at least civil if
 
not affectionate relationships between culturally diverse peoples
 
Guy Dubay:  Americans,  especially former Loyalists,  tried to
 
make use of lingering anti-British feeling among Acadians
 
stemming from the deportation period to press the American claim
 
for the Valley;
 cites Wilmot Ashby,  who published series in a
 
Mars Hill newspaper called "The Complete History of Aroostook,"
 
speaking of post-deportation Acadians confronted by Loyalists,  as
 
writing "In their anqer they moved up-river."
 The more they
 
could make the French resent the British,  the easier it might
 
have been to press the American claims to the disputed
 
territories,  but the Acadians were not generally parties to such
 
propagandistic overtures;
 in 1831,  the American partisans
 
elected Pierre Lizotte to the Legis-lature,  but Lizotte wrote to
 
Governor Smith saying,  "I was born a British subject and I intend
 
to die so."
 Lizotte had been born in Quebec,  which was British
 
administered;
 [talks about]  American John Baker displaying
 
American flag on the Fourth of July in 1827 and being
 
incarcerated and fined for it by New Brunswick government;
 the
 
Acadians, who had experienced a measure of representative
 
government in dealing with the British authorities since 1710,
 
were not totally averse to Royalist or higher article authority
 
and were not especially of the Yankee republican fervor; there
 
were really fifteen,  not thirteen,  American colonies:  two of
 
them,  Nova Scotia and Quebec,  rejected the revolution
 
[END OF SIDE ONE,  MAP-LO-AOOl;  CONTINUED ON SIDE TWO]
 
Guy Dubay:  as an indication of cultural diversity in Valley,
 
cites an American company,  A.  S.  Dufour of Madawaska in 1848--
half a dozen years after the Webster-Ashburton Treaty--conducting
 
business in French while keeping accounts in pounds,  shillings,
 
and pence;
 [Dubay points to a reproduction of pages from the
 
A.S.  Dufour register mounted on a poster with signage:  "Cultural
 
Integration:  The Prima Faciae Evidence; A.S.  Dufour Traders,
 
Madawaska,  Maine,  1844-1848"];
 even though the Treaty made the
 
southern shore of the river American,  it was easier to float a
 
log down to Fredericton where they were sorted,  rafted to St.
 
John,  loaded on ships and sent to Liverpool,  England;
 some
 
lumber was shipped to Boston where,  following the Webster-
Ashburton Treaty,  it was admitted duty-free although shipped
 
through a British-American port
 
Guy Dubay:  there is a perception in the U.S.  that the Valley
 
is remote,  and Acadians have swallowed some of that propaganda,
 
but I describe the situation as "isolation at the cross roads"
 
since this is where the cultures meet
 
Guy Dubay:  heard stories from his Acadian forebears of their
 
fences being burned by the British in southern New Brunswick
 
before they relocated to Grande Rivière in 1791;  stories how "les
 
anglais" would purposely leave open Acadian root cellars to allow
 
the produce to freeze,  thereby encouraging the Acadians to leave;
 
important to realize that the Loyalists arrived in fall and there
 
was little seasoned firewood;  there are similar fence burning
 
incidents directed against Irish settlers;  I conclude that
 
Loyalists were not "anti-French so much as anti-cold."
 
Guy Dubay:  Cites Mason Wade  (
"The Loyalists and the
 
Acadians" from "The Franco-American Overview"):  religious
 
motivation for exodus of Acadians from Lower St.  John to Upper
 
St.  John has been under-rated;  at that time,  Quebec claimed the
 
upper St.  John;  settlers may have felt they were resettling to
 
Quebec religious jurisdiction
 the Quebec government felt there
 
was political advantage in a French presence in the Upper St.
 
John Valley,  and they were more tolerant of Catholic religious
 
presence than were the Loyalists of the Lower St.  John or the
 
Americans;
 "In this century,  we could hardly expect American
 
historiography to cite American religious bigotry as fanning the
 
flames of rebellion.
 In fact we tend to leave religion out of
 
the issue altogether.  .
 .
 The Acadians could well have placed
 
greater hope on the Quebec Act than present economically oriented
 
or minded historians might have us consider."
 
Guy Dubay:  Before proceeding,  I'd like to digress with four
 
definitions of Acadians from the University at St-Louis Maillet:
 
historic,  genealogic,  operational,  and prospective;
 [He holds up
 
what appears to be a copy of the Saint John Valley Times]
 
Historic definition:  based on the pre-1755 geography of
 
where
 the Acadians lived  (example:  Acadia National Park
 
is so-
 called because Acadians lived on Mt.  Desert before
 
1613,
 even though the area is more "Down East" and
 
"Yankee");
 historic definition can allow for
 
descriptions that make
 
no sense,  like the National Geographic's description of
 
the Valley as "Down East With a French Accent."
 
Genealogic definition:  relies on bloodlines,  but can lead to
 
a kind of exclusiveness,  as with the Daughters of the
 
American Revolution
 
r
iona1 definition:  much more flexible.  .
 .being Acadian
 
s based on what you do;
 it allows admission to the
 
nner circle based on the costume you wear,  rather than
 
he ancestry of your heritage or convictions
 
ospective definition:  based on what Acadians can become;
 
in this area fall all of the programs that politics can
 
generate, whether they be educational,  cultural,
 
eing Acadian here is not based on what one is or what
 
ne does,  but on what one aims to do
 
Guy Dubay:  The problem comes in when you bring in people
 
with different definitions for the same thing;
 one person talks
 
with a prospective intent,  while another tries to understand what
 
he hears from an historic perspective;
 something as elusive as
 
"Acadia" or "Acadian"  is open to gross misunderstanding unless
 
the parties talking know which definition is being used
 
Student  [commenting on required reading text "Who or What is
 
a Franco?"]:  This is so idiotic;
 it says:  "By present
 
operational definition,  anyone who falls into one or more of the
 
following perimeters is a Franco.
.. 
1
1  
the very first one says:
 
1
1 •
 .is interested in French culture."
 So the operational
 
definition says if you're interested in Acadian culture you're an
 
Acadian!

MAINE ACADIAN CULTURE SURVEY
 
AUDIOCASSETTE RECORDING LOG
 
RECORDED 06/18/91,  by LISA ORNSTEIN
 
This entry logs the second of three 60-minute audiocassette tapes
 
documenting guest presentations by Guy Dubay  (Madawaska,  Me.)  and
 
Yvon Labbé  (Orono,  Me.)  for the education course EDU 475:
 
Cultural Diversity in Maine Education,
 recorded in room 203  and
 
-
-
 of Cyr Hall at the University of Maine at Fort Kent,  Fort
 
Kent,  Me.,  on the morning of  18 June 1991.
 
RECORDING LOCATIONS:  Microphone was set up in the student seating
 
area of both classrooms.
 In each case,  the microphone was about
 
10-15 feet from the guest speakers.
 
PERFORMER LOCATION:  Mr.  Dubay and Mr.  Labbé spoke from standing
 
positions.
 Both speakers,  and particularly Mr.  Labbé,  tended to
 
stroll while speaking.
 
RECORDING SET-UP:
 Maranz audiocassette tape recorder with one
 
Sennheiser microphone with cardioid head pointed upward and
 
angled out slightly,  mounted on a microphone jig attached to a
 
stand.
 
TAPE BIAS:
 Normal.
 
NOISE REDUCTION:  none.
 
RECORDING PROBLEMS:
 Speakers'  tendency to stroll while speaking
 
caused occasionally uneven recording levels.  Cardioid head tended
 
to pick up extraneous noises from outside the classrooms.  Loose
 
electronic connections  in the headphone input made it impossible
 
to accurately verify channel balance and difficult to monitor
 
fidelity.
 
LOG DATA COMMENTS:
 
SIDE ONE:
 
[Guy Dubay continues reading his translation of a simplified
 
history of the Acadian settlement of the Saint John Valley;
 
Dubay then reads "another pamphlet published by Title VII"  in the
 
1970s,  also clearly written for children]:
 "There were two
 
groups of people in Acadia,  the English and the French.. .The
 
Acadian and the English had a hard time living together without
 
arguing.
 The Acadians had the best land.
 The English wanted the
 
Acadians to live just like them. .  . After the American Revolution,
 
there were many English people in New Brunswick.
 After a while
 
the Acadians no longer felt at home."
 The pamphlet then follows
 
the migration up the St.  John.
 
David Veilleux:  he  [Dubay]  was the historian on that
 
project!
 [Class laughs]
 
Guy Dubay:  continues with a section he wrote "because I
 
think it bears telling."
 Population increased,  boys worked in
 
woods and girls worked at home and on farm,  tractors were
 
introduced,  paper mill built,  people "tired of working in the
 
woods and on the farms" decided to work at Fraser and built homes
 
nearby,  town grew,  brick school and high school were built called
 
"Acadia School."
 This was written to explain to third graders
 
that the school was named not to honor just one person "but all
 
the people before us whom we call Acadians."
 Then the Acadian
 
Festival was created "with a parade,  and games,  and to get people
 
to talk about their family and help people to remember the old
 
stories.
 So,  during the Acadian Festival Week,  we sometimes see
 
people dressed in the old-fashioned way."
 
Guy Dubay:  talks about explaining Acadian migration to third
 
and six graders;
 "Third graders understand that the Acadians
 
came from the East;  as adults we don't,  that they come from all
 
over the place.
 But I've always said that the age of reason is
 
seven:  it's downhill from then on."
 
David Veilleux announces a break;
 asks for any questions;
 
[Question is unintelligible.]
 
Guy Dubay answers:  there were three or four generations in
 
Nova Scotia,  then the deportation era;
 I always tell people that
 
when our ancestors left Acadia and ended up in Quebec they were
 
young people;
 we always talk about those who lost their farms,
 
but there were young people;
 Young guys and young gals looked at
 
what they saw over there,  which is why the year after the
 
Acadians moved to Madawaska their in-laws moved in from Quebec;
 
we're on the main line of commercial travel...
 
[BREAK:  following the break,  students moved to the adjoining
 
room,  where Yvon Labbé gave his presentation;  on two blackboards
 
in front of the classroom,  Labbé has written up the results of
 
the early morning exercise,  in which he asked the students to
 
write down the first five words which come to mind when they
 
think of defining Franco-Americans:
 
proud;  short;  relatives;  tradition;  kinship;  religious;
 
/3
 
hardworking;  family loyalties;  French;  family-oriented;
 
discriminated;  hardworking;  clean; humor;  self-conscious;  family-
oriented;  family; happy;  non-political;  changing;  short;
 
Catholic; workaholic;  learning disabled; work ethic;  French
 
speaking;  short;  farming;  church;  Catholic;  French speaking;
 
Catholic;  short;  fun loving;  accent;  language;  short; respect;
 
migrants;  family;  Catholic; An Acadian adult said she left high
 
school early because she was teased; A teacher in Caribou said
 
that schools there should not address second language needs"]

of the class]

Yvon Labb6:
 defines his use of the term "culture" as
 
relating to "essentially what is unconsciousness,  not what is
 
conscious. ,
, 
Culture is mostly unconscious,  and you don't have
 
any choice about it; you can choose to observe a holiday or not,
 
but the holiday is in us;
 culture is "the accumulated wisdom of
 
a people,  passed on to the generations," including the good,  the
 
bad,  the ugly,  the prejudices,  racism,  etc.;
 culture is complex
 
and hard to dismantle;  as Antonine Maillet says:  "It takes a
 
hundred years to destroy one word."
 Whether our children speak
 
French or not,  they have it;  it's a matter of their having the
 
necessary environment to express it;
 we need to change the
 
environment,  not the person

Yvon Labb6:  the social upheaval of the 1960s,
,  "which gave
 
permission to do things that had not been done before," came late
 
to Maine and "so we had a little window of opportunity for us.' , 
Acadians owe thanks to women,  Blacks,  Hispanics for "disturbing
 
the waters enough so we could come out a little bit without being
 
seen a whole lot."
 Students at the University began comparing
 
notes about their public school experiences,  eventually forming a
 
support group and devising labels for their experiences,  like
 
"non-monolingualism. 1
1 
they found that the University history and
 
language departments "didn't know we  (Franco-Americans)  existed."
 
Yvon Labb6:  we created the term "Franco-American" to include
 
all of us;  it's a political term--it situates us in the United
 
States;
 It doesn't define me, I'm a "jarret-noir. 1

That is my
 
emotional definition,  my root;
 my people drove animals to
 
Quebec;  in order to save their shoes,  they would take them off
 
and they would arrive in Quebec with their ankles black;
 I'll
 
use "Franco-American" here to include all of us,  though it
 
doesn't really fit any one of us

Yvon Labb6:  describes early operations;  "the University
 
discovered we weren't going away,  and slowly the welcome mat
 
disappeared";  trying to convince the foreign language department
 
to change its name  (
"because our French isn't a foreign
 
language"); We decided to "own" the French that we have,  own it
 
and use it

began to develop a body of knowledge about who we are;  put
 
together statistics;
 counted all the French names in the
 
University telephone book,  over 95% were janitors,  secretaries;
 
same at the State House;
 project at mental health institute:  no
 
culturally appropriate therapy available
 
Student:  how many names did you find changed from French to
 
Yvon Labbd:
 lots;  I changed my name because a teacher
 
mispronounced it as "Yvonne;"
 it wasn't until I was thirty that
 
I took my name back;
 shows how much baggage I carried about the
 
language;.
 our inheritance was what we called then 1
1shame-
based": we were socialized in subtle ways to be ashamed of our
 
parents and grandparents and where we came;
 if you take "Maine
 
History" and you're not in it,  and your parents and grandparents
 
are not in it,  and you know you've been here for a hundred years,
 
there's nothing to be proud about;
 it takes more than telling
 
someone to be proud,  you have to have some kind of self-knowledge
 
Yvon Labb6:  discusses parochial and secular schools and
 
other institutions,  "meant that the French people had to support
 
two systems."
 By WWII,  they were "no longer willing to support
 
the parochial system," and by the  160s it had
, mostly died.
 "That
 
left us not represented on the school board,  in the teacher
 
colleges and the university,  not represented in government .
.. and
 
we're still there.
 our identity is not reflected in governing
 
b
o d ie s."
 
Student:  even our college-educated children learn and teach
 
Parisian French;  they are afraid,  ashamed
 
Yvon Labb6:  the foreign language department at the
 
University still bases its view of French culture on France;
 
they don't even know much about Quebec;
 New England Franco -
American literature is not integrated into the system;
 students
 
are down-graded for using "low class" words like "patatell  instead
 
o f
 
- 
Student:  disagrees,  thinks statements have been too broad,
 
too sweeping;
 thinks Labb6 has been rehashing old stereotypes
 
and demanding instant cures;
 sees no harm in teaching standard
 
French,  as long as local usage is not simultaneously put down
 
Yvon Labb6:  no English department requires its students to
 
speak like Englishmen; we don't hear English speakers saying:  "My
 
English is not correct."
 It's not an issue in English,  but
 
French has the Academy,  language police;  Labb6 claims there is
 
"standard North American" French;
 "it doesn't have to be
 
Parisian.
 The songs my mother taught me are not in gibberish,
 
they're in standard French."
 
Student:  today,  students have to be prepared for
 
standardized tests;
 they are being judged by their ability
 
speak standard French,  same as by standard English
 
Yvon Labbé:  a book by Antonine Maillet,  written in Acadian
 
French, won the highest literary prize of France;
 that's the
 
beginning of the change,  of disobeying sacred cows
 
Different Student:  Quebecois make fun of Valley French
 
Student:  I don't take it an insult,  because I don't have
 
that negative "they're dumping on me" attitude;
 I keep hearing
 
in these courses how we should be depressed and how we've been
 
dumped on...
 
Yvon Labbé:  the issue is not whether Francos have been
 
"dumped on" but what access have they had to education,  to power;
 
example:  Lewiston,  second largest city in Maine and heavily
 
Franco, was last to get a University campus,  will be first one
 
closed
 
Student:  it's only twenty minutes to Portland and Augusta,
 
why did they build one there?
 I'd close it,  too!
 
Yvon Labbé:  cites Gerard Michaud getting honorary PhD,  first
 
ever Franco;
 "It has to do with the University discovering,
 
through pressure,  that community does exist,  that it deserves to
 
be studied,  it deserves to be valued..
. 
1
1  
Yvon Labbé:  advocates voting to increase Franco presence in
 
government and positions of power generally;
 discusses poor
 
showing of Franco churchmen and politicians;  suggests cultural
 
differences in speaking style are misinterpreted by non-Francos

This entry logs the third of three 60-minute audiocassette tapes
 
documenting guest presentations by Guy Dubay  (Madawaska,  Me.)  and
 
Yvon Labbé  (Orono,  Me.)  for the education course EDU 475:
 
Cultural Diversity in Maine Education,
 recorded in room 203  and
 
-
-
 of Cyr Hall at the University of Maine at Fort Kent,  Fort
 
Kent,  Me.,  on the morning of 18 June 1991.
 
RECORDING LOCATIONS:  Microphone was set up in the student seating
 
area of both classrooms.
 In each case,  the microphone was about
 
10-15 feet from the guest speakers.
 
PERFORMER LOCATION:  Mr.  Dubay and Mr.  Labbé spoke from standing
 
positions.
 Both speakers,  and particularly Mr.  Labbé,  tended to
 
stroll while speaking.
 
RECORDING SET-UP:
 Maranz  audiocassette tape recorder with one
 
Sennheiser microphone with cardioid head pointed upward and
 
angled out slightly,  mounted on a microphone jig attached to a
 
stand.
 
TAPE BIAS:
 Normal.
 
NOISE REDUCTION:  none.
 
RECORDING PROBLEMS:
 Speakers'  tendency to stroll while speaking
 
caused occasionally uneven recording levels.  Cardioid head tended
 
to pick up extraneous noises from outside the classrooms.  Loose
 
electronic connections in the headphone input made it impossible
 
to accurately verify channel balance and difficult to monitor
 
fidelity.

RECORDED 06/22/91,  by LISA ORNSTEIN
 
This entry logs the second of three 60-minute audiocassette tapes
 
documenting  the  Red  Cross  Benefit  Concert  for  Allagash,  Maine,
 
recorded in the gymnasium of the Fort Kent Community High School in
 
Fort Kent, Me.  on the evening of 22 June 1991.
 
RECORDING LOCATIONS:  Recording equipment was set up  in the  front
 
row of the audience seating,  with the microphone about 15-20  feet
 
from the performers.
 
PERFORMER LOCATION:  Performances took place on a raised stage.  In
 
most  cases,  the  stage amplification was  located  at  front-center
 
stage.
 
RECORDING  SET-UP:
 Maranz  audiocassette  tape  recorder  with  one
 
Sennheiser microphone with cardioid head,  manually held.
 
TAPE BIAS:
 Normal.
 
NOISE REDUCTION:  none.
 
RECORDING  PROBLEMS:
 Gymnasium  acoustics  and  changes  in  stage
 
amplification  set-ups  made  for  a noisy,  unpredictable  recording
 
environment.
 
LOG DATA COMMENTS: The Red Cross Benefit for Allagash, Maine is one
 
of a series of  on-going regional fund-raising events benefitting
 
victims of the 1991 Spring ice-jam and flood in Allagash, Me.  The
 
bulk of the material and performance styles at this event are not
 
particularly  germane  to  the  focus  of  the  Maine  Acadian  Culture
 
Survey.  Performances whose audio portion consist of pre-recorded
 
commercial music were generally not recorded, but are brief-listed
 
with a note to this effect for logging purposes. Audience applauded
 
following  performances  and  announcements.  Tape  MAP-LO-A007  was
 
recorded by Ray Brassieur.
 
SIDE ONE:
 
PERFORMANCE #1:
 Victoria Dance Studio  [Fort Kent,  Me.]:
 
[Six  groups  of  children  and  adolescents  ranging  in  numbers
 
from
 four
 to
 about
 twenty,
 costumed
 by
 group
 in
 various
 
combinations of black spandex tights, biking shorts, or baggy pants
 
and
 tank
 tops
 or
 tee-shirts,
 occasionally
 with
 glittery
 
accessories,  perform  energetic,  aerobic  dance  routines  to  pre-
recorded top forty rap and instrumental selections]  [not recorded]
 
[Intermission: during the thirty-minute intermission, a short
 
[approximately 5 minutes] fund-raising video is shown several times
 
on a television monitor at one side of the gym; the video, produced
 
by  Allagash  native  Cathie  Pelletier,
 shows  a  series  of  old
 
photographs
 from
 Allagash;
 the
 audio
 portion
 consists
 of
 
reminiscences of Allagash's early days from older residents,  laid
 
over the soundtrack of an original song by Pelletier,  "The River
 
Rolls On"]  [not recorded]
 
[Mr.  Charles
 ("Chuck")
 E.
 Closser  continues  announcements  and
 
introductions]:  In addition  to  Fort  Kent's  Summerfest  and  other
 
summer events,  there will be another Allagash benefit concert on
 
17-18  August  with  performers  Jim  Glaser,  Jennifer  Kimball,  and
 
Randy Van Warmer;  Jim Glaser has  been a Nashville  star  for many
 
years and is very well known; next performers are a wonderful group
 
from Allagash,  the Allagash Little People
 
PERFORMANCE #2:
 Allagash Little People  [Allagash,  Me.]:
 
[Four  or  five  adults  disguised  in  comical  garb  dance  and
 
wiggle to the soundtrack of a rock-and-roll  song,"It's All Right
 
Now";  audience giggles along]
 
[Mr.  Closser announces next performers]:  next performers are
 
from Madawaska;  a brother and sister team; Pat is a junior in high
 
school  and  brother  has  just  graduated;  he'll  be  off  to  U.S.M.
 
(University of Southern Maine)  this fall;  I wish we could keep him
 
here in the Valley.
.
. for purely selfish reasons
 
PERFORMANCE #3:
 Pat and Dave Pelletier [Madawaska, Me.]  [Pat
 
Pelletier,
 on
 vocals,
 and
 Dave
 Pelletier,
 on
 vocals
 and
 
synthesizer,  performed a contemporary popular song]:
 
Song #1:  "I Will Stand Beside You"
 
[Mr.  Closser introduces next singer]:  Brenda Hebert will now
 
join Dave Pelletier for a song
 
PERFORMANCE  #4:  Brenda  Hebert  [Saint  David,  Me.]  and  Dave
 
Pelletier  [Madawaska,  Me.]  [Hebert,  on vocals,  and Pelletier,  on
 
vocals and synthesizer,  performed a contemporary popular song]:
 
David Veilleux:  went through a period of feeling angry about
 
being "dumped on;"  it was necessary in order to reach a new view
 
of self,  but I no longer feel angry;
 once the new under-standing
 
has been reached,  the anger is no longer "in the picture;"
 feel
 
more at peace with my heritage when in the Saint John Valley;
 
feel that the Valley is 1
1chez nous,"  feel different in the Valley
 
"because there are so many of us here"
 
[Discussion of differences between Valley and other Acadian
 
communities;
 Saint John Valley described as more "open" and
 
Guy Dubay:  same in state politics; Valley sends legislators
 
who will "play the games," will get cooperation from legislature;
 
but Lewiston Francos more strident;  "We get put down in Augusta

Yvon Labb6:  there are some nice things happening;  identity
 
is being defined;  if we can protect our children from the "dumb
 
frog" things and remove obstacles from their path,  we have a
 
future;
 Any questions?
 
David Veilleux]:  draws similarities between Maine Indians
 
and Franco-Americans; described by others,  now taking their own
 
identities;  "for a long time,  people told us who we are;  now
 
we're emerging and telling people who we are."
 The reason that
 
the book Guy Dubay had read earlier didn't get published and sent
 
to the schools was that "we realized then the limitations of that
 
kind of material:  it tends to be stereotypic..."
 
[Discussion re:  treatment of Indians; Labb6:  we ought to
 
support Indians redefining themselves]
 
Yvon Labb6:  F.A. R.O.G.  was reflective of the Franco-American
 
population,  10% gay;
 there were two gays who came out;
 that's
 
another issue we have to deal with:  Franco gays;
 (Jokes]
 
David Veilleux:  reports discrimination against Japanese in
 
southern Maine
 
/2
 
of Blacks on posters;
 in California,  they make a point of having
 
Asians,  Blacks,  Hispanics  [on posters]; we should too,  but we
 
just don't think of it;
 it's not intentional or done to injure
 
anyone,  but it still happens
 
[David Veilleux]:  discusses "unconscious" or "subtle"
 
racism;  sometimes it's not confronted because here we don't have
 
a lot of Black people;
 fighting between Latinos and Cambodians
 
in Califor-nia over jobs,  etc.;  same thing in Lowell,
 
Massachusetts,  also in Portland,  Maine
 
Guy Dubay:  sister married a pilot from Loring AFB in the
 
50s; married in the presbytère,  not the church:  "and it wrenched
 
the family apart."
 The non-Catholic pilot later converted
 
Student:  "We are isolated,  and when I take my kids out of
 
the Saint John Valley it becomes a culture shock. .  .They're being
 
labeled as  'the French Connection,'  I hear that.
 It's a
 
frightening experience for these kids. .  .They may be our future,
 
but they're fighting their heritage.
.
.  I've found that the kids
 
who go into the military actually come back and they've done away
 
with whatever French they had. .  .They don't want to be known as a
 
Frenchman."
 
Student:  when I arrived in the Saint John Valley as a speech
 
therapist,  it was announced in the school that I would be in the
 
Nurse's Office;  seventy-five seniors came down..
. they didn't have
 
speech problems:  "I want to get rid of my accent before I go to
 
college."
 
Student:  reports discrimination against French Canadian
 
migrant laborers when a girl;  called drunks,  thieves;  I don't see
 
that now,  but I am beginning to hear the same things about
 
Hispanics who are coming in this summer
 
Student:  it's fear of the unknown
 
Guy Dubay:  there has been a revolution in Quebec and New
 
Brunswick; the people have gained political power and have gained
 
self-assurance;
 we have received cultural recognition,  but we
 
have not yet attained political power
 
Yvon Labbé:  individual legislators have made progress:  John
 
Martin,  Judy Paradis;  legislation has been passed mandating
 
cultural-awareness programs by the seventh grade;  but "the grass
 
roots political pressure is not here yet,  demanding it."
 
Guy Dubay:  discusses influence of Irving on both sides of
 
the border;  growing somewhat less now,  but still strong;  taxes on
 
the Canadian side are driving New Brunswickers across the border
 
to shop in U.S.,  but Irving still pockets the money and New
 
Brunswick loses  its tax base;  that may change when our taxes go
 
up
 
Yvon Labbé:  advocates "decentralization" and
 
"democratization" of art,  education;  "What it takes is people
 
like you or me saying to the University of Maine:  'We want
 
teachers who can do this or we want training that can do that.'
 
You define what it is that needs to be done,  and not let them
 
come up here as if they knew everything."
 Democratize education,
 
art,  and health care:  "It imposes a generic system upon everyone,
 
as if we were all the same;  as if we do not have internal support
 
systems that we could bring to bear for self-healing,  for
 
wellness,  whether it's emotional,  psychological,  or physical."
 
[END OF SIDE ONE,  MAP-LO-A003;  CONTINUED ON SIDE TWO]
 
Guy Dubay:  treatment of mental health patients; misdiagnosis
 
of "rebels"
 
[General discussion:  schedule; words "rebel"  and "protestor"
 
used to control people,  given negative connotation;  answers to
 
some of "Franco Americans in Maine" questionnaire;  existence of
 
"slums"  in Lewiston;  comparative quality of life in Lewiston,
 
Bangor,  the Saint John Valley; work conditions in textile mills;
 
differing pronunciation of "r" sounds in French,  methods of
 
teaching French pronunciation; more answers to questionnaire]

AUDIOCASSETTE RECORDING LOG
 
RECORDED 06/21/91,  by LISA ORNSTEIN
 
This entry logs the first of two 60-minute audiocassette tapes
 
documenting the Centennial Concert in honor of the Good Shepherd
 
Sisters,  recorded in Saint Bruno Church,  Van Buren,  Me on the
 
evening of 21 June 1991.
 
RECORDING LOCATION:
 Southern transept of the church about twenty
 
feet from the
 central choir riser.
 
PERFORMER LOCATION:
 Choirs stood on three banks of three-tier
 
risers set up in a "U"  formation in the forward central area of
 
the sanctuary.
 The speakers stood at a podium to the left of the
 
choir.  The portable Hammond organ was placed between the choir
 
and the audience,  to the right of the choir in the floor area
 
between the communion rail and the forward pews.
 
RECORDING SET-UP:
 Maranz  audiocassette tape recorder with two
 
Sennheiser microphones with cardiod heads pointed upward and
 
angled out slightly,  mounted on a microphone jig attached to a
 
stand.
 
TAPE BIAS:
 Normal.
 
NOISE REDUCTION:
 Dolby B on.
 
RECORDING PROBLEMS:
 Due to our late arrival,  the recording set-
up was hasty and there was no time to do a sound test.  Loose
 
electronic connections in the headphone input made it impossible
 
to accurately verify channel balance and difficult to monitor
 
fidelity.
 
LOG DATA COMMENTS:
 Information on
 song titles,  composers,  choir
 
soloists,  directors,  and accompanists  listed in this entry are

Audience applauded after every song.
 
SIDE ONE:
 
[Tape begins during the singing by the Good Shepherd Sisters
 
of "The Servant Song," during which they
 file down the central
 
aisle of the nave to take their seats  in the front pews,  led by a
 
Good Shepherd Sister dressed in centennial habit,  carrying a
 
lighted commemorative church candle in a long brass candlestand.
 
The candle bearer set the candlestand down in front of the high
 
altar and took her seat with the other Sisters]

COMMENTS.  Speaker:  Jason J.  Parent.  [Language:  English]
 
[Description of events marking arrival of Good Shepherd
 
Sisters in Van Buren Maine,  3 April 1891];  over the frozen St.
 
John River,  six Good Shepherd Sisters arrive In Van Buren by
 
horse sleigh from Saint Leonard,  N.B.  [names given];  church bells
 
peal welcome;  in a short prayer service,  priest and parishioners
 
give thanks for arrival of Sisters and ask blessings for the
 
Sisters'  third American congregation;  at Hill Street Convent
 
(corner Roosevelt Avenue and High Street,  former Hall House
 
Hotel),  pastor  (Father François Morcel  [
?], Marist),  welcomes
 
Sisters and introduces them to an enthusiastic group of local
 
women  [family names given]; meal eaten; visit to convent school
 
and visit from Marist Fathers who teach at St.  Mary's College
 
[Van Buren,  Me.]  end public activities of first day of arrival.
 
COMMENTS.
 Speaker:  Phyllis Doucette  [Language:  French]
 
[Description of reactions and activities of Good Shepherd
 
Sisters during early days of their arrival in Van Buren];  In
 
their first moment of privacy,  Sisters share their reactions to
 
their first day of arrival in Van Buren;  include prayers of
 
gratitude in their evening prayer;  they note their thanks in
 
their annals;  the arrival of the Sisters is the richest day in
 
the Catholic heritage of Van Buren,  where the parishioners began,
 
and continue today,  to drink from a cool and comforting
 
wellspring; marked realization of a cherished dream of Marist
 
Father Arteaud and His Excellency James Augistin Healy,  Bishop of
 
the Portland diocese.
 After four years of planning between
 
Marist Fathers and Sisters of the Good Shepherd in Quebec City
 
and Biddeford,  Me.,  and the  [unintelligle],  the great day finally
 
arrived:  the arrival of the Good Shepherd Sisters  in Van Buren,
 
Me.;  [enthusiastic applause from audience marks the end of this
 
commentary]

COMMENTS.
 Speaker:  Tracy A.  Lajoie  [Language:  English]
 
[Historical development of educational resources for
 
children in Van Buren during the early 1900's];  By early 1900's,
 
Van Buren citizens needed to expand school buildings and number
 
of Good Shepherd Sisters  in order to ensure an adequate education
 
for their children;  by 1910,  enrollment at new Good Shepherd
 
Common School was 300;  by 1918 number of students  forced use of
 
parish hall for supplemental classrooms;  in 1919,  negotiations
 
resulted in construction of present convent at 300 Main St.  so
 
that the building at 306  (Main St.),  renamed Sacred Heart School,
 
was dedicated solely as classroom space
 
In 1919,  two new schools built:
 Champlain School,  financed
 
by the parish;  Saint John,  financed by the town;  1923:  total
 
enrollment of students in Van Buren schools  (including rural
 
schools)  was  1475;  credit to local town officials,  parishioners,
 
and religious orders;  in 1924,  a tragic fire destroyed Sacred
 
Heart School but through efforts of Father  [unintelligle]  and
 
cooperation of parishioners,  a new school was built
 
In 1930's,  annexes to both Sacred Heart and Champlain schools
 
built to accomodate overload of students;  Good Shepherd Sisters
 
accepted principalship and some teaching responsibilities at
 
Champlain and Keegan Schools as well as Grand Isle;  in 1944 they
 
added Hamlin,  Haswell,  and Connor to the  list of their teaching
 
roster.

From th

French at the upper level  : "cours supérieur];  among those
 
Sisters teaching French at this level,  two taught more than two
 
decades each:  [sisters named rise and audience responds with a
 
warm round of applause];  one of the Sisters instituted an
 
intensive French program which made possible the obtention of a
 
certificate of honor from the Institut Eon Pasteur  (Quebec City)
 
upon graduation;  this certificate is now offered through Centre
 
universitaire Saint-Louis-Maillet  [Edmundston,  N.B.,  Canada];
 
evokes names of other Sisters who specialized in French:  a
 
patient,  excellent Sister who directed production of dramatic
 
works by the students;  a Sister  (Eva Chouinard)  whose trips to
 
France and the "pays d'Evangéline,  terre de nos ancêtres,  les
 
Acadiens" contributed substantively to inculcating and developing
 
French and Acadian culture in the classroom;  at the request of
 
the bureau of public education of the State of Maine,  she
 
instituted an individual studies program in French which allowed
 
the students to progress at their own pace;  Sister Eva Chouinard
 
was the last Sister to teach French in the high school

ASSUMPTION PARISH CHOIR.  [Grand-Sault,  N.B.;  listed as
 
"Grand Falls"  in the program; program lists Sister Bernadette
 
Sirois as the director but Thomas Hebert introduces as director
 
Madame Cindy Toner  (my own guess at spelling),  and accompanied on
 
the organ by Mrs.  Bernice Dumas;  approximately twenty-one
 
choristers  (sixteen women,  five men)  ranging in age 30-70 years]

COMMENTS.
 Speaker:Tracy A.  Lajoie  [Language:  English]
 
[Focus on success stories and development of some of the
 
school programs instituted
 by the Good Sisters:  music]; quotes
 
from Psalm 104  (
"I will sing to the Lord all my life,  make music
 
to my God while I live")  as appropriate description of approach
 
to music taken by Good Shepherd Sisters,  as revealed in their
 
archives and albums; they diligently prepared student choruses
 
for every special occasion:  civic and religious,  graduations,
 
choral festivals,  programs honoring religious,  municipal,  and
 
state dignitaries
 
for many years there was always a Sister as a full-time
 
piano teacher;  students received diplomas from Dominion College
 
of Music and Sherwood College of Music;  piano recitals were a
 
yearly event;  one Sister  (named)  taught piano for two decades;
 
the record reveals that over and over the students sang at
 
Jubilee and Sunday Masses,  and even at Sunday Vespers  [there's a
 
small buzz in the audience here]; who among the older generation
 
does not remember the daily singing sessions of their school
 
days]
 
[tape runs out a few seconds before the end of the speaker's
 
final comments]
 
[END OF MAP-LO-005 SIDE A]
 
SIDE TWO:
 
COMMENTS.  Speaker:  Phyllis Doucette  [Language:  French]
 
[Focus on success stories and development of some of the
 
school programs instituted
 by the Good Sisters:  religion];  from
 
1891 to the end of the 1960's,  religion was taught daily at the
 
beginning of the school day;  over the years,  the Sisters noted in
 
their daily journals the religious activities in which their
 
students took part:  First Communion,  Confirmation ceremonies,
 
retreats,  Sunday school,  summer classes at Loring Air Force Base
 
[Limestone,  Me.],  songs at Sunday Mass and Vespers; with the
 
fusion of the girls'  and boys' high schools in 1965,  and given
 
the decreasing number of religion teachers,  it was practically
 
impossible to teach religion every day;  to remedy this situation,
 
Sister I
-
iélène Lachance undertook the coordination of religious
 
education on a full-time basis  [audience applauds]; with the
 
cooperation of Sisters and lay teachers,  she organized a weekly
 
one-hour program which made use of the time allotted by the Maine
 
Board of Public Education for "different activities;" this
 
program continued until 1986;  the direction of this program is
 
now in the hands of devoted,  efficient lay teachers
 
Religion classes are held in the Parish Hall;
 the Sisters
 
participate in the teaching of sacramental classes;  all these
 
efforts aim to fulfill the philosophy of Superior Mother Marie du
 
Carmel:  Let us make our students good Christians first,  and then
 
scholars,  if we can [audience laughs,  then applauds warmly
 
[As Saint Bruno parish choir takes their places on the
 
risers,  Master of Ceremonies Thomas Hebert announces that there
 
will be a videotape of all of the week-end's activities]  the
 
choir concert,  the convent open house,  the performance of "La
 
Sagouine," the Sunday Mass,  the
 reception and banquet,  will all
 
be on one tape and available for purchase; those interested in
 
the tape  [slight pause]  can call Father Wally  [Father Walter
 
Gaudreau  [audience laughs]
 
SAINT BRTJNO'S PARISH CHOIR.  [Van Buren,  Me.;  directed by
 
James Perkins and accompanied on the organ by Sarah M.  Stewart;
 
approximately twenty-eight choristers  (twenty women,  eight men)
 
ranging in age from 30-70 years]
 
"Plus près de Toi."  ["Plus près de Toil'  is a French-language
 
adaptation of "Nearer,  My God,  to Thee," a famous hymn standard
 
composed by Yankee singing teacher Lowell Mason,  with words by
 
Sarah F. Adams;  the words of the refrain sung by the Saint Bruno
 
choir are a translation but the verses are different than the
 
Adams text; where composer credits are normally listed in the
 
printed concert program,  the credit reads "Cantate Gloriam Dei"
 
(sing to the glory of God);
 
choir sings the French adaptation a capella  (the only such
 
rendition in the whole concert); during the French verses they
 
cast the song into a slow duple meter sung in a stately,  almost
 
declamatory style;  after two such verses,  they sing the first
 
verse of "Nearer,  My God,  to Thee," switching to English and the
 
original 6/4 meter of the Mason composition,  until the last line
 
of the refrain,  which they continue  (in English)  cast back into
 
the slower duple meter;  thunderous applause follows]
 
"America the Beautiful." Composer:  Katherine Lee Bates
 
[Bates is the lyricist; the melodist is Samuel A.  Ward;  the
 
audience gives the choir a standing ovation at the end of the
 
performance]
 
[Thomas Hebert invites audience to rise and stretched while
 
combined choirs assemble in the sanctuary,  and introduces the
 
choirs; turns on all the lights in the church "so that everybody
 
can see everybody;" thanks commentators;  congratulates
 
chairperson for the evening's activities,  Mrs.  Pat Ezzy]
 
COMBINED CHOIRS.  [eight choirs,  directed by James Perkins,
 
with organ accompaniment by Sarah Stewart and flute solo by Cindy
 
Dufour]
 
"Freedom Land."
 Composer:  Dvorak,  Beery.
 Soloists:  Janice
 
Lapointe and Peter Martin.
 
"La Rivière St.  Jean." Composer:
 P.C.  Francois,  S.M.
 
Soloist:  Janice Lapointe.
 
[here the audience gives a standing ovation,  cries of
 
"bravo" echo in the church;  the organist strikes up the refrain;
 
choir director James Perkins turns,  thanks audience and explains
 
that unfortunately only two songs have been rehearsed with the
 
massed choirs,  but that the choir will sing a one-verse reprise

AUDIOCASSETTE RECORDING LOG
 
RECORDED 06/27/91,  by LISA ORNSTEIN
 
This entry logs a single 60-minute audiocassette tape documenting
 
the  "Acadian Mass,"  an activity of the  fourteenth  annual Acadian
 
Festival,  recorded in Saint David Church,  St.  David,  Me.,  on the
 
morning of 27 June 1991.
 
RECORDING LOCATION:
 Front east corner of the pews about fifty feet
 
from the pulpit.
 
PERFORMER LOCATION:
 The sermon and readings were delivered from a
 
pulpit located on the front west end of the sanctuary.
 The altar
 
was set up toward the front and center of the sanctuary. The organ
 
was  located  in  front  of  the  sanctuary  on  the  west  side  of  the
 
church,  kitty-corner  to  the  altar.
 The  choir  was  seated
 on
 
folding chairs church facing the organist with their backs to the
 
altar.
 
RECORDING  SET-UP:
 Maranz  audiocassette  tape  recorder  with  two
 
Sennheiser  microphones  with  cardioid  heads  pointed  upward  and

Processional:
 
Organ Solo #1,  2,  and 3:  Eno titles available]
 
[As organist plays,  a small group of men and women process
 
down the central aisle of the church.  They carry banners bearing
 
local  family  names  and  crests  [apparently  these  banners  are
 
souvenirs from previous family reunions associated with the Acadian
 
Festival]; when they reach the front of the church they process to
 
the east wall where they hang their banners on previously placed
 
stands;  a few  banners,  including  that  of  the  Sirois-Duplessis
 
family, the focus of the 1991 family reunion, are laid on the steps
 
leading up to the sanctuary; the clergy process up the center aisle
 
and into the sanctuary]

[END SIDE ONE MAP-LO-A009;  CONTINUED ON SIDE TWO)
 
SIDE TWO:
 
[recording begins with the closing phrase of the quote from
 
Edmé Rameau de Saint-Père]
 
Monseigneur Chalut:  "their lives may be summed up in a single
 
sentence:  'they were an honest and happy people'"
 
Monseigneur Chalut: If they did not care about tomorrow it was
 
they had trust  in God;  they  leaned heavily on  "le bon Dieu" and
 
these people wanted to live in peace; and as a few of them escaped
 
the great deportation and went up the river,  it was then that in
 
1785,  to  get  peace,  that  they  were  constantly  harassed  by  the
 
English and especially by a man by the name of Hasting, they moved
 
to  the  region  of  Saint  David
 [Maine]
 and  Saint-Basile
 [New
 
Brunswick]  and  already  at  that  time,  in  1751,  the  priest  from
 
Rivière Queu e [Quebec] had to come to minister to the Acadians who
 
had settled on both sides of the river;  these Acadians came here
 
because they wanted to be left alone,  so late June 1785, Madawaska
 
country, was the arrival of the first Acadians; their first act of
 
the main group was to plant a wooden cross at the landing site and
 
thank God were able to live in peace forever; the parish of Saint-
Basile, when they had the parish, and as the river was the means of
 
transportation and communication,  one community on both sides of
 
the river,  there were many  Canadians  there,  people who had come
 
from the St.  Lawrence  shores,  and  they helped  one  another;  they
 
lived as brothers;
 
Monseigneur
 Chalut:
 Father
 Albert
 states
 in
 his
 book
 
[Monseigneur Chalut proceeds to paraphrase from pp.  242-3 of Leo G.
 
Cyr's  Madawaskan  Heritage; 
Cyr  translated  excerpts
 (no  page
 
references)  from Thomas Albert's L'histoire du Madawaska, Quebec:
 
Imprimerie fransiscaine missionnaire,  1920]  the life in Madawaska
 
was  peaceful;  Canadians  and  Acadians  consorted  like  the  blood
 
brothers they really were,  and like the true relatives that they
 
had become since the origin of the colony;
 since  at the  onset,
 
women were less numerous than men,  the youth of Madawaska went to
 
Kamouraska to get wives; and for anyone who recognizes the salutary
 
influence that the mother exercises  in the Acadian family,  there
 
will  be  no  doubt  that  the  relationship  between  the  Acadians  of
 
Acadia  and  Canadians  were  always  harmonious;  this  distinctive
 
characteristics; however; were more pronounced then than after the
 
complete fusion of qualities and defects of the two elements; thus
 
the Acadians were more  reserved,  more  cautious;  he was  cautious
 
about  all  his  projects;  the  Acadian,  more  stand-offish,  more
 
reticent, waited until people came to him, while the Canadians, the
 
Canadian was outgoing; while every bit as frank as the Acadian, was
 
not  quite  as  sensitive  about  keeping  his  word;  they  had  on  the
 
other hand more  initiative,  more education;  the Acadian,  equally
 
active, was more attached to the old customs and ways of living; a
 
bit suspicious,  he took offense at the Canadian habit of  locking
 
doors,  while he knew nothing of locks;  the cousin from Canada was
 
orderly and as in his conduct with his affairs, he was more careful
 
of his relations with his neighbor;  the Acadian was more careless
 
about  the  conduct  of  his  business,  which  he  easily  confided  to
 
others;  he  was  less  business-like  and  depended  more  on  Divine
 
Providence; he preferred oral arrangements, community of property,
 
and more freely left his fields open to his neighbors; the Acadian
 
was a better builder and carpenter while the Canadian was a better
 
farmer

MAINE ACADIAN CULTURE SURVEY
 
AUDIOCASSETTE RECORDING LOG
 
RECORDED 06/28/91,  by LISA ORNSTEIN
 
This  entry  logs  the  first  of  two  60-minute  audiocassette  tapes
 
documenting a free public event entitled "Story of the Acadians,"
 
featuring presentations by Ms. Bernette Albert [Madawaska, Me.] and
 
Mr.  Rosaire  Sirois  [Caribou,  Me.].  "Story  of  the  Acadians,"  an
 
activity of the Fourteenth Acadian Festival,  was  recorded  in the
 
Madawaska High School library,  Madawaska,  Me.  on the morning of 28
 
June 1991.
 
RECORDING LOCATION:
 Extreme left-hand side of the front row of the
 
audience  seating  area,
 approximately  four  feet  from  the  VCR
 
monitor.
 
PERFORMER  LOCATION:
 Ms.  Albert  and  Mr.
 Sirois  spoke  to  the
 
audience from the front of the audience seating area.
 Both had a
 
tendency to stroll while speaking.  The VCR monitor was located at
 
the  extreme  left-hand  side  of  the  front  of  the  audience  seating
 
area.
 
RECORDING  SET-UP:
 Maranz  audiocassette  tape  recorder  with  one
 
Sennheiser microphone with cardioid head pointed upward and angled
 
out slightly,  mounted on a microphone jig attached to a stand.
 
TAPE BIAS:
 Normal.
 
NOISE REDUCTION:
 Dolby B on.
 
RECORDING PROBLEMS:
 Speakers' tendency to stroll made it difficult
 
to maintain stable recording levels.
 
LOG DATA COMMENTS:
 Comments  from Ms.  Albert and Mr.  Rosaire have
 
been
 transcribed
 essentially
 ver
 batim.
 Repeated
 words
 and
 
falterings have been eliminated for the most part.  Bracketed words
 
or  phrases  punctuated  with  a  question  mark  indicate  that  the
 
transcriber  is  not  certain  of  what  is  being  said.
 Paragraph
 
divisions and punctuation reflect tape log guidelines.  Ms.  Albert
 
spoke
 extemporaneously;
 Mr.
 Sirois
 spoke
 extemporaneously,
 
referring occasionally to a small black notepad.
 
SIDE ONE:
 
[Tape log announcement]
 
Bernette Albert:  announces that talk will begin in about five
 
minutes
 
Bernette Albert:  [recording begins mid-phrase;  Ms.  Albert is
 
saying  (
jestingly)  that she is not one hundred percent certain of
 
the family name of the audience she is addressing]:  .  .  .but I did
 
get  wind  of  the  idea  that  it  was  Sirois-Duplessis,  Sirois dit
 
Duplessis; and so, that you might get acquainted with yourselves a
 
little bit,  and don't hesitate during the next three days,  to walk
 
up and introduce yourself and meet your cousins, long-lost cousins,
 
okay?  Feel free, be friendly; this is three days for you,  strictly
 
for you.
.
. and you know what it's for?  [announcement comes in over
 
the public address system in the background]
 
Bernette  Albert:  Never  ceases  to  amaze  me;  somebody  from
 
Vancouver,  looks at the map and sees,  Madawaska,  Maine,  right at
 
the top.
. . a little tiny dot.
.
. and they decide to come; I think I'd
 
go the other way [audience laughs].. .but they come,  they come; and
 
they come for one great big reason:  culture;  it's that important;
 
you  are  what  you  are  because  of  culture;  we  can  have  our  own
 
nationality,  to  say the  least,  that's very true;  we are  just as
 
proud as being American citizens or Canadian citizens,  but you as
 
an individual,  you who reside in that physical body of yours,  you
 
are what you are because of culture;  it is that important
 
Bernette  Albert:
 And  so  I guess  it  is  worthwhile  to  come
 
across the country to find out who you are. .  . and that's precisely
 
what I aim to do -
-
 not just me -
-
 during the next three days,  is
 
to give you the identity,  those of you who are far away; you don't
 
have a choice;  the migration to the western states,  the northern
 
tier of the western states. .  . alright? And the western provinces of
 
Canada: those with the names like yours, those with the names like
 
Martin,  Cyr,  Daigle,  Albert,  you name it,  Levasseur,  they started
 
migrating  about  1880,  and  they  took  the  little  train  here  in
 
Edmundston;  went as far as Ottawa;  then they had to take a stage
 
coach;  later on the track was finished;  and their first stop was
 
Missoula,  Montana;  the call had gone out,  you see,  from go west,
 
young man,  go west; and young man went west.
.
. and never came back;
 
so the names are there; you visit the Missoula,  Montana cemetery,
 
you are going to find every single name that you can think of that
 
we  know  from  the  area;  there  is  no  choice;  your  roots  are  from
 
here; I'm not saying Madawaska itself now, mind you; I'm saying the
 
general geographic area,  are from here
 
Bernette  Albert:
 And  if  you  don't  mind,  I'll  tell  you  a
 
little story:  when I was out there visiting,  I had a little cheap
 
Song #1:
 untitled  [Incipit:  "Day turns to night,  and here on
 
this jet plane"]
 
Song #2:
 "My Old Man"  [Mallet gets the audience to sing along
 
on the  chorus  toward the  end  of  the  song;  they  try,  falter,  and
 
have a giggle; Mallet rallies them and they give it another try]
 
Song  #3:
 "This  Town"
 [Mallet  introduces  the  song]:
 I'm
 
originally
 from
 Dover-Foxcroft;
 nobody
 knows
 where
 that
 is
 
[audience laughs and applauds]; now living in Nashville; this took
 
a little getting used to;  I finally wrote a song for Nashville and
 
for every other large city I' ve ever been in  [Mallet adds a rack-
mounted harmonica to his guitar accompaniment]
 
Song #4:  untitled [Incipit:  "Inch by inch,  row by row,
 gonna
 
make  a garden  grow"][After  the  final  verse,  Mallet  talks  to  the
 
audience about the song while vamping chords on the guitar]: wrote
 
the song about fifteen years ago; Gordon Bok learned it first,  then
 
Pete  Seeger,  then  the  Muppets  and  Arlo;  then  it  got  put  into
 
children's songbooks; an 11-year old friend of mine found it in her
 
school  songster  and told her  friends that she knew the composer;
 
they pooh-poohed her claim,  countering that the composer was dead
 
[audience  laughs];  this tells you what kids think about  songs  in
 
those  songbooks;  please  help  me  sing  the  chorus  if  you  know  it
 
[audience sings along on chorus]
 
Song #5:  untitled  [Incipit:  "Now I had a woman just like her
 
in  1965"][Mallet  adds  a  rack-mounted  harmonica  to  his  guitar
 
accompaniment]
 
Song  #6:  untitled  [Incipit:  "And  in  the  shade  of  this  old
 
tree,  in the summer of my dreams"]  [Mallet comments about this song
 
following performance]:  fairly new tune,  recorded by Cathy Midea
 
[my spelling]  recently; this makes me happy to no end;  starting to
 
get  some  cuts  down here  [several  record  artists  named];  so  it's
 
nice;  I can' t wait until about a year from now;  the money takes a
 
while  to  get  in  [audience  laughs];  have  some  records  for  sale
 
tonight;  have enjoyed playing and thank you
 
Song #7:  untitled [Incipit:  "It was the last week in June,  it
 
was the first quarter moon"]  [Mallet adds a rack-mounted harmonica
 
to his guitar accompaniment]
 
[Mr.  Closser thanks Dave Mallet]
 
[END OF MAP-LO-A006;  CONTINUED ON MAP-LO-A007]
 
camera, I had about twenty-four shots, I thought, well, there can't
 
be that many people out there,  so  I'll visit the  cemeteries  and
 
I'll take the twenty-four shots; well,  if I'd have taken a shot of
 
everybody that was buried there that had a name which I knew,  I'd
 
still be there;  they're all there
 
Bernette Albert:
 One of them was real cute;  a tombstone;  a
 
young man went  out,  with his young wife;  he died  accidently,  so
 
naturally,  they  buried  him,  and  on  the  tombstone,  guess  what's
 
there? His name,  "ne"  (which means born,  okay?),  date; underneath
 
is  "décédé," which means  "died,"  okay? Naturally,  we all die;  so
 
they put her name underneath his, but sixty years went by, and they
 
had put her name with  "née,"  and date of birth;  and sixty years
 
later,  she  no  longer  "décédée"; she's  "died,"  on  the  tombstone
 
[audience laughs]; she had no longer "décédée" by that time; and I
 
was struck by that;  it's  just that,  you know,  time catches up to
 
us,  no matter where we are,  no matter who we are
 
Bernette Albert:
 The fact remains,  however,  that we are who
 
we  are,  personally,  largely  because  of  our  culture; there  is  a
 
difference -
-
 we're pretty well mixed up with French-Canadian and
 
Acadian culture by now; across the United States and Canada, we are
 
now  multi-cultural  almost,  because  we  have  a  lot  of  different
 
nationalities that have come in; there is a difference between such
 
cultures;  you  take your  Acadian  culture,  for  instance,  okay?  As
 
opposed to your French-Canadian culture
 
Bernette Albert:  Okay;  Champlain was hired and came over and
 
settled at Saint Croix,  which  is  on the coast  of Maine;  did not
 
settle really;  he had planned to settle,  but,  they experienced a
 
very  harsh winter;  the  following  year,  they  moved  over  to  Port
 
Royal,  which is now Annapolis,  in Nova Scotia,  okay? The old maps
 
even indicate what is now Nova Scotia as Acadia;  and so that's how
 
it all started
 
Bernette Albert:  Where  they got  the  name Acadia,  there  are
 
many different versions;  way out in Greek history,  you will find
 
"A"  "K"  "K"  "A"  "D"  "I"  "A" and "S";  it's debatable as to whether
 
the  nomenclature  of  Acadia  for  this  island,  so  to  speak,  was
 
actually, actually stems from that; it's not a foolproof thing; but
 
anyway, there are indications; be that as it may,  it became Acadia
 
Bernette Albert:  Now, another fact of history,  is that Acadia
 
was never Canada; this really surprises a lot of people; Acadia was
 
never  Canada;  it  was  always  Acadia;  by  the  time  Canada  became
 
Canada, Acadia no longer existed,  it was Nova Scotia at that time
 
Bernette Albert: Coming back to Champlain, they went back the
 
next  year,  and  they  settled  at  Port  Royal,  and  war,  of  course,
 
England, way back in history, England and France were fighting back
 
and  forth;  whenever  France  won  the  war,  Acadia  stayed  French;
 
whenever  England won the war,  Acadia was  English;  regardless  of
 
those poor settlers who were there; they were largely for-got-ten;
 
France at that  time was  also  settling  in Louisiana,  was  also  at
 
that time,  in  1608,  was  settling Quebec,  and  so,  these Acadians
 
were  largely  forgotten;  the  English didn't  like  them,  you  can't
 
blame them;  they weren't loyal to them
 
Bernette Albert:  Anyway,  the years went by;  generations were
 
in Acadia; 1755, okay; le qrand derangement, okay? The expulsion of
 
the Acadians; England had finally won its last war with France, and
 
France ceded all of Canada;  so Canada was now English,  regardless
 
of the French people who were settled there; Canada was English by
 
now,  okay?
 In  the  meantime,  neither  did  the  colonists  of  the
 
thirteen colonies like England; you know, the Boston Tea Party and
 
all that;
 and what happened?
 Good old Americans won the war with
 
England;  and so the Loyalists got scared; What better thing to do
 
than flee to English land? Canada;  and they did,  and they did
 
Bernette Albert:  And  some  of  them,  of  course,  the Acadians
 
that  had  been  deported;
 some  were  deported  along  the  entire
 
thirteen colonies; and some fled, fled to New Brunswick, to Quebec
 
Bernette Albert:
 And a small band of them  (this is to bring
 
you to Madawaska) a small band of them had settled in Ste-Anne-des-
pays-bas  [an announcement comes in over the public address system
 
in the background]  which is now close to Fredericton,  today;  but
 
the Loyalists wanted land;  and they were safe;  and so again they
 
were displaced;  there's an awful lot of history to all this as to
 
how  this  happened;  some  is  good  and  some  is  bad;  it's  not  all
 
bad.
.
. as far as the English are concerned..
. they decided to come up
 
the  Saint John;  the  Saint John had been a throughway  for years,
 
they knew the area; they had friends, they had Malecite friends up
 
and down the  river;  they  knew  the  area;  so  they  petitioned  for
 
land,  to  come  to  a land  of  their  own,  again,  to  try  to  have  a
 
country  of  their  own;  bear  in  mind  that  they  had  been  largely
 
forgotten by France;  they were on their own,  there's no question;
 
so it was a struggle for survival exclusively
 
Bernette Albert:  So when they landed up here,  they,  as  soon
 
[one or two words unintelligible], I don't know if all of you have,
 
but we have memorialized the action; what they first did was kneel
 
down  and thank  the Almighty  for  at  long  last  having  a place  of
 
their own;  and they stayed isolated.
.
. oh,  until World War One,  if
 
not  World  War  Two;  they  stayed  isolated  at  least  until  the
 
governments decided that they should pay taxes; when taxes get into
 
the picture,  they find you  [audience laughs];  there's no question
 
about it, they find you;  in fact,  I remember my own grandfather as
 
a little,  girl,  like this  [pointing to  a girl  in the audience],
 
probably smaller,  saying that,  if he left the Valley,  and crossed
 
the river,  he was going to Canada;  if he went anything beyond Van
 
Buren,  he was going to the States  [audience laughs];  and we often
 
wondered where he thought he was [audience laughs]; but of course,
 
we couldn't ask him because  in those days,  you did not ask your
 
grandparents
 such
 questions,
 you
 just
 merely
 listened
 [an
 
announcement  comes  in  over  the  public  address  system  in  the
 
background]
 
Bernette Albert:
 And this shows up today even at that;  your
 
Acadian culture  is much more reticent,  not as ambitious,  as your
 
French Canadian culture; not as outgoing, very polite; it will show
 
up in family living; the French Canadian culture will tend to be a
 
little  bit  sterner,  as  far  as  the  children  are  concerned;  the
 
Acadian,  usually was the mother,  that did all the upbringing;  the
 
father was really struggling to survive,  planting crops,  cutting
 
wood, building homes,  and that type of thing;  in addition to that,
 
the  women  usually  went  to  school  more  than  the  male  did,  so
 
naturally,  whenever,  whatever  was  in  writing,  or  needed  to  be
 
decided,  it was matriarchal,  it was the mother,  more;  as opposed
 
to,  the French Canadian culture; but we have a,  a healthy mixture
 
of it all in our blood,  in our psyche by now [laughs],  so,  some of
 
these days, well, you feel a little bit. .  .more reticent, you're not
 
too sure; you're very cautious, very cautious, highly independent;
 
you're not to sure you're going to believe what's told you; on the
 
other side, you're going to speak your mind; and you don't care who
 
listens,  but you're going to  speak  it;  you're  not going to  fear
 
speaking your mind, you're not going to fear repercussions as much
 
as the Acadian culture,  people will
 
Bernette Albert:
 So,  we have a happy,  healthy mixture;  and
 
with that,  I'd like to welcome each and every one of you; take time
 
out  while  you're  here;  forget  the  mortgage  [audience  laughs],
 
forget all these bills;  just take time out to savor,  really,  how
 
important history is to you individually and how important culture
 
is to you  individually;  what  I'm going to show you  is an audio-
visual  of the  story of the Acadians;  the main reason that we're
 
doing this is not to slight,  the French Canadian culture,  and not
 
to divorce ourselves from it; we can't, we wouldn't be able to,  if
 
we tried;  it's the idea that the Acadian culture has been put so
 
far back that nobody was paying any attention to it whatsoever; we
 
knew the  French Canadian culture as we  grew up,  but the Acadian
 
culture was just a no-no,  an ahhhh  [Ms.  Albert shrugs],  that type
 
of thing;  so we decided that,  hey,  this exists,  and it is part of
 
us,  and  it  is  high  time  that  we  realize  that  and  that  we  take
 
action to preserve some of the things that belong to us;  not for
 
us, not for us here in Madawaska and in the Valley; we've known who
 
we were all along,  we've known;  no question about it;  but for the
 
children's children; the Society [Madawaska Historical Society] has
 
one of these goals; we don't know what the future will do with our
 
efforts,  we've  been at  it twenty years;  we have managed to  save
 
quite a few things; we don't know if the future will care about it,
 
we don't know if they'll care about the cross that we erected to
 
commemorate the  arrival  of  the Acadians  here  in the Valley;  but
 
there's one thing we do know: they will never be able 
to accuse 
us of not having cared enough to do something for them, because, we
 
did;  if they don't care,  fine;  we're going to be six feet under;
 
it's up to them;  but they'll never be able to accuse us
 
Bernette Albert:
 After the presentation,  I will certainly be
 
handy  to  answer  any  question,  discuss  any  particular  personal
 
things that maybe, that you want us to do while you're here,  don't
 
hesitate,  we're here for you
 
[Ms.
 Albert  sets  up  the  VCR  monitor  to  play  back  the
 
videocassette copy of "The Story of the Acadians"]

SIDE TWO:
 
[Conclusion of videocassette presentation of the  first of a
 
MPBN television documentary series,  "The Story of the Acadians";
 
Bernette Albert turns off the monitor and Rosaire Sirois comes to
 
the front of the audience]
 
Rosaire Sirois:
 Why don't you,  everybody,  get up and move;
 
you've been sitting down for a couple of hours; and I'll take over
 
[Audience  rises  and  stretches;  Bernette  Albert  and  Rosaire
 
Sirois  answer  a  couple  of  questions  informally  concerning  the
 
morning schedule; Rosaire invites audience to take their seats]
 
Rosaire Sirois [swings a wooden ratchet to get the audience's
 
attention,  then  speaks]:  Sit  down,  and  I'll  take  over;  alright,
 
people?  [Audience settles down in their chairs]
 
Rosaire  Sirois  [speaking to  a member  of  the  audience,  Leon
 
Sirois  of  St.
 Agathe,
 Me.]:
 Assis-toi,
 assis-toi  Leon;  make
 
yourself at home
 
Rosaire Sirois [addressing the audience]:  My name is Rosaire,
 
Sirois;  and  I' m  sixty-six  years  old  and  I  retired  from  the
 
railroad;  worked  on  the  railroad  some  thirty-eight  years;  and,
 
whenever I wasn't working on the railroad,  I used to go door-to-
door peddling, sharpening knives and scissors, so I'm very familiar
 
with the people of the Valley; and I think, that I know more people
 
in the Valley than anybody else and I think I'm known more by the
 
people of the Valley than anybody else;  I hope  I'm not,  I don't
 
want you people to think I'm bragging
 
Rosaire  Sirois:  But  anyway,  I'll  start  you  off  on  a joke,
 
alright?
 When  I was  eighteen years  old,  I graduated  from high
 
school,  from Van Buren Boy's High School,  and I had never been out
 
of the state of Maine;  the furthest I had been at that time,  was
 
probably Houlton which  is  about  forty miles,  maybe Millinocket,
 
because I had a sister at the time that was living over there;  so,
 
I got drafted;  and,  in the month of August,  I end up at Fort Kent
 
and the Army put me on the gin job [unsure of term used],  I'm going
 
to talk about that;  on Twenty-one
 Twenty-two;  and I headed  for
 
Oakfield,  and after I got to Oakfield and now they transferred me
 
on Number Two,  and I headed for,  Fort Devens Mass., which is Ayre,
 
Mass.;  and,  I was  in the,  I was enlisted and  I was sworn  in and
 
everything;  and,  at that time,  back  in 1943,  they called us  "the
 
cream of the crop" because they were getting all the boys out of
 
the high school at the time; they should have called me "skim milk"
 
because I only weighed about a hundred and twenty-nine pounds at
 
the time; but anyway, I had never heard my name mentioned any other
 
way but "Rosaire Sirois";  so,  about the second day that I was  in
 
the service and we were in the auditorium, about five thousands of
 
us, all high school boys,  and they were calling out our names to be
 
shipped to different parts of the country,  for basic training; and
 
when he came to my name,  the sergeant in charge,  he must have had
 
twenty years of service because he had stripes from here to there
 
[Mr. Sirois points from his shoulder to his sleeve] and my kneecaps
 
were going this way and that way,  and I was scared to death;  but
 
anyway,
 when  he  called  out  my  name  he  called  for  "Rosaire
 
[unintelligible; a mispronunciation of the name "Sirois"]  [someone
 
in the audience laughs], so I never moved an inch; pretty quick, he
 
put my card down at the bottom and pretty quick he called out some
 
other names and  I wasn't the only one who was dumb,  there was  a
 
number of us fellows dumb,  but anyway my name would crop up again
 
so  I didn't  dare  move;  til  finally  [unintelligible],  after  the
 
third or fourth time, he says,  "I want to see that new recruit from
 
State Street, Van Buren"; there was nobody else but me, so I got up
 
with my duffle bag and all,  it weighed a hundred and twenty-nine
 
pounds, I had,  I didn't lug it,  I, I pulled it; when I got in front
 
of the sergeant, he looked at me and he says,  "How do you pronounce
 
that name?" So I told him,  "Rosaire Sirois";  "Well," he says,  "we
 
got a war to win; from now on," he says,  "anything that starts with
 
an  '5':  Sullivan,  Smith,  or  'S'  'H'  'I'  'T,'  move!" [Audience
 
laughs] And I' ve been moving ever since  [more laughter]
 
Rosaire Sirois [pointing to a ship's knee which he has brought
 
as a display item]: Now,  let me bring you up to date on this,  ship
 
knees;  this  ship  knee's  part  of  our  culture;  this  is  exactly
 
Québécois,  it's  not Acadian;  this,  they  call  it  in  French,  1
1 un 
coude"; this  is to brace a building;  [someone from audience asks
 
for clarification]  a brace;  brace a building,  a roof,  especially
 
the  attic;  now,  the British were very  interested  in,  because we
 
were, kicked out of Nova Scotia, we come up the Valley; we come up
 
the Valley,  especially,  to get away from the British,  because,  of
 
Grand Falls, they couldn't come up, with a ship and invade us, with
 
their ship,  you see? So, we were in virgin land, what we call, wood
 
that never been cut before; and this [pointing to the ship's knee],
 
the Acadians and, the Québécois and the Acadians at that time were
 
building barns and houses; and they were using that, to brace,  the
 
attic of their house;  it was very strong because it's a,  a root of
 
a tree;  it's a spruce
 
Rosaire Sirois  [questioning audience]:  Everybody understands
 
French, uh English there now? [majority of audience nods to affirm]
 
Because I can say it in French,  too
 
Rosaire Sirois:  And anyway,  they'd use that,  and the British
 
were very interested in this to make their ship,  and make the hull
 
of their ship;  so what they do,  what they did at that time,  they
 
sent some of their British buyers up the Valley here to buy lumber

Rosaire Sirois:  And this ! they sent some of their buyers up
 
the Valley to buy ship knee and virgin wood; and the only means of
 
ways to transport it over there at that particular time, was on the
 
river; so they'd cut that, and put it on the ice in the wintertime;
 
and then, come spring,  the ice would melt,  and it would float down
 
to Saint John and Fredericton; and they'd put a boom out there and
 
they'd pick them up;  and they'd make ship,  the hull of the ship

Rosaire Sirois:
 And since I found these,  these ship knees,
 
ten or fifteen years ago, I've located about five buildings here in
 
the Valley that's got them;  now I talked to a gentleman two days
 
ago, and he says he tore--this gentleman is ninety-three years old,
 
Mister John Fortin, from Van Buren--he told me during his lifetime,
 
he tore a lot of buildings down and they were [unintelligible] and
 
he didn't know  [these things?];  so,  this is part of our history
 
Rosaire  Sirois:  Now,  I'll  bring you to the  fence post  [Mr.
 
Sirois points  to  a fence post and rail which he has brought  for
 
display];  we never had no wires to make,  fence to,  to our sheep,
 
and this,  area  right here  in the Valley,  before the  first World
 
War,  we  were  known  as  a  sheep  country;  Mr.  Joe  Theriault  [my
 
spelling]  from Van Buren used to come up the  Saint John,  beyond
 
Fort Kent,  with a,  what they call a rack a
 foin, he had a team of
 
horse,  and he had a rack for hay,  and,  with a couple men,  and he
 
start, pick up the sheeps there now from Saint John, New Brunswick
 
and he used the main highway,  the road that we,  travel on today,
 
and he'd head for Van Buren; when he'd come to Van Buren there now,
 
there was a yard out there,  and the railroad was  in existence at
 
that time because the railroad came into Van Buren in nineteen-o-
one
 
Rosaire Sirois:
 And,  incidentally my father remembered when
 
the first train came into Van Buren; my father was born in nineteen
 
eighty-five  [somebody from the audience corrects Mr.  Sirois about
 
the date]; did I say nineteen?  [laughter from audience] Correct me
 
please,  that's  alright;  anyway,  in  eighteen  eighty-five,  and he
 
remembered, I remember him saying there now that he remembered when
 
that  first  train  came  in;  he  must  have  been  about  eighteen  or
 
seventeen years old thereabouts
 
Rosaire Sirois:
 But anyway,  they'd load the sheep into them
 
cars they had at that time and they were shipped off,  but,  in the
 
Second,  in the  First World War,  the potatoes  started to  sell;  I
 
remember one  of my uncles,  he was  selling his  potatoes at that,
 
during  the  First  World War,  eighteen  dollars  a barrel;  so  they
 
dropped the  sheep,  gradually;  and they went to  the potato;  they
 
were using this  [Mr.  Sirois points to a fence post and rail which
 
he has brought for display]  for fences;  and this  is part of,  our
 
wood; cedar, that, you [rake that?] and you, every farmer's got low
 
land,  and this is where cedar used to come,  and you take a log and
 
you split it in half,  and you cut it in eight,  eight or ten feet
 
long,  whatever the  length  is;  matter of  fact,  I stole that  [the
 
fence post and rail]  from Tante Blanche  [Tante Blanche Museum in
 
St.  David,  Me.],  place this morning when I went by  [laughter from
 
audience],
 but  anyway--I'm  going  to  return  it,
 Father--[more
 
laughter from audience]  and,  that's how that's how they make the
 
fence;  and how they do that,  they had no wire,  they had no wire,
 
they took  two  posts  there  and  then  two  posts  there  [Mr.  Sirois
 
demonstrates how posts were  leaned against each other to support
 
rails] and two posts there,  and they'd criss-cross them like that;
 
and that was their fence
 
Rosaire Sirois: And also,  whenever they wanted to use a gate,
 
there was  no  problem because  all  that  they'd  have  to  do  was  to
 
remove the cedar,  not the cedar post,  but the cedar log and that
 
was  it;  they'd  use  that  as  a,  a gate;  so  this  is  part  of,  our
 
culture right here
 
Rosaire Sirois:  Also there now, we, got a, barrel [Mr. Sirois
 
points to a wooden potato barrel which he has brought for display],
 
we're the only ones that picks potatoes  in the,  in the world I'm
 
pretty sure,  that picks potatoes in a basket and in a barrel;  the
 
barrel there now you pick that, you get, about a hundred sixty-five
 
pounds;  and it takes a good man to pick a hundred barrels,  a day;
 
and, tomorrow,  I have the champion of the world coming, to pick, to
 
my  talk here:  Walter  Sirois,  from Van  Buren,  from,  Caribou;  he
 
picked,  September  the  thirtieth,  nineteen  fifty;  he  picked  two
 
hundred and thirty-five barrels in nine and-a-half hours; [murmurs
 
and whistles of appreciation from the audience]  and he's going to
 
be here tomorrow, so get your camera, and get your pencil ready and
 
you'll want  an autograph;  and this  paper right here,  I was  told
 
[Mr. Sirois points to what appears to be a photocopy of a newspaper
 
article],  that  you  can  get  a copy of  it;  and  this  is  his,  talk
 
about, when he was interviewed two years ago by a gentleman by the
 
name of,  Rick Levasseur,  news feature writer;  and he tells there
 
now that particular day,  when he picked;  but he wasn't out to,  to
 
break any record; he was just,  he was an average,  it says here in
 
one place now [Mr.  Sirois refers to the newspaper article] that he
 
picked  a thousand--I  forget  exactly--a  thousand  eight  hundred
 
barrels I guess,  or something like that;  over a thousand barrels
 
anyway,  in five days;  at an average of a hundred and eighty-eight
 
barrels a day; a regular machine; because I picked one time eighty-
two barrels and I slept like the dog when I was through  [laughter
 
from audience]; and it takes a good man to pick, a hundred barrels,
 
that's,  that's almost  [unintelligible];  and this gentleman,  he'll
 
be here tomorrow morning,  but, he lives,  crow fly, he lives in New
 
Sweden,  I live  in  north  Caribou;  crow  fly  he  lives,  about  four
 
miles  away;  I wanted  him  to  come  today,  but,  he's  got  a heart
 
condition and I don't want to push him so  [unintelligible]
 
Rosaire  Sirois:
 And he's  a Sirois,  too;  [unintelligible],
 
cirrhosis,  sideway,  and Serious;  whatever you  [audience  laughs];
 
whichever way you want to pronounce it
 
Rosaire Sirois:  Now let me bring you up on a little bit of,
 
anybody  [Mr.  Sirois  swings  the ratchet which he has brought  for
 
display],  I bet Father knows what this is,  but anybody knows what
 
this  is?  [somebody  from  the  audience  says,  "a  noise-maker"];  a
 
noise-maker,  they call  it  in French un cric-crac, to make noise,
 
cric-crac means,  to make noise; during Lent,  the,  the bell,  would
 
go to  [unintelligible];  they wouldn't ring the bell;  so whenever,
 
the Mass would start, during Lent, and during Holy Week; especially
 
during--I  said Lent but  I meant Holy Week--whenever the,  things
 
would start for Holy Week there now,  the sexton would come out on
 
the  front porch,  of the  church  [Mr.  Sirois  swings  the ratchet];
 
that'd be the time for them to come in; because they couldn't ring
 
the bell; you see? And every church,  in the Valley,  has got one of
 
these; this come's from--I stole it too--[laughter from audience],
 
comes from Sacred Heart;  I asked Father Hebert,  Abel Hebert there
 
now,  if I could have it,  and he said,  "Help yourself"

documenting a free public event entitled "Story of the Acadians,"
 
featuring presentations by Ms. Bernette Albert [Madawaska, Me.] and

Madawaska High School library,  Madawaska, Me.  on the morning of 28
 
June 1991.
 
RECORDING LOCATION:
 Extreme left-hand side of the front row of the
 
audience  seating  area,
 approximately  four  feet  from  the  VCR
 
monitor.
 
PERFORMER  LOCATION:
 Mr.  Sirois  spoke  to  the  audience  from  the
 
front  of  the  audience  seating  area.  He  had  a tendency to  stroll
 
while speaking.  The VCR monitor was  located at the  extreme  left-
hand side of the front of the audience seating area.
 
RECORDING  SET-UP:
 Maranz  audiocassette  tape  recorder  with  one
 
Sennheiser microphone with cardioid head pointed upward and angled
 
out slightly,  mounted on a microphone jig attached to a stand.
 
TAPE BIAS:
 Normal.
 
NOISE REDUCTION:
 Dolby B on.
 
RECORDING  PROBLEMS:
 Mr.
 Sirois'
 tendency  to  stroll  made  it
 
difficult to maintain stable recording levels.
 
LOG DATA COMMENTS:
 Comments from Mr. Rosaire have been transcribed
 
essentially  ver  batim.  Repeated  words  and  falterings  have  been
 
eliminated for the most part. Bracketed words or phrases punctuated
 
with a question mark indicate that the transcriber is not certain
 
of what is being said.  Paragraph divisions and punctuation reflect
 
tape log guidelines.  Mr.  Sirois spoke extemporaneously,  referring
 
occasionally to a small black notepad.
 
SIDE ONE:
 
[Recording

 occurs
 as
 Mr.
 Sirois
 continues
 his
 
discussion of buying goods across the Canada-United States border]
 
Rosaire Sirois:  .
.
. article of whatever we wanted to buy,  if it
 
was cheaper on the other side, we'd go over there and buy it;  like,
 
beans,  molasses,  and,  flour,  lots of times  it was cheaper on the
 
other side;  now history has it,  and now it's the other way around
 
now;  the  stuff  is,  higher  over there,  and cheaper  over here,  so
 
people from Canada,  they go the other way;  and,  I've  seen times
 
there now;  it's been this way and that way,  it depends on the,  on
 
the market up  there,  the particular  article,  and  they  still  do,
 
even down to today
 
Rosaire  Sirois:  Well  anyway,  coming  back  to  my  story  [Mr.
 
Sirois had begun to tell a story about smuggling in Hamlin, Me.  at
 
the end of MAP-LO-A0101, they were all farmers out there in Hamlin;
 
I would  say,
 about  fifty  farmers  maybe;  on  a  [coughing  from
 
audiences obscures next few words] ten, twelve miles, and, they had
 
just come out with the telephone;  so the ones that could afford a
 
telephone,  were the biggest smugglers;  there was a reason behind
 
that;  because,  when  Arthur  Gauthier  [my  spelling]--he  was  an
 
Acadian from Lewiston, he was border patrol--whenever he'd harness
 
his  [little?]  horse;  I remember  the horse  distinctly;  everybody
 
would keep an eye on the immigration office;  and when he'd leave
 
the immigration office and come through the town,  and he was all
 
bundled up in a,  couvert de carriole, what they call a couvert de
  
carriole, I don't  know  if  you people  know what  that  is;  it's  a
 
blanket made  out  of,  the hide;  and he'd be all wrapped up with,
 
oh .
.. anyway!  Whenever  he'd  cross  the  river  [Saint  John  River],
 
across the crossing at Van Buren going up towards Hamlin, there was
 
a lady right on the corner of the street there now;  she'd jump on
 
the telephone;  and them telephones in them days was a box,  with a
 
crank; and she'd get on the telephone and she'd crank; nobody would
 
answer the  telephone,  nobody;  but  she'd  crank  right  along there
 
now;  that meant,  that Arthur Gautier was on his way to Hamlin; he
 
was  [going?],  making his patrol,  you see?  [Mr.  Sirois addresses a
 
member  of  the  audience]:  You're  nodding your head,  you  remember
 
that,  probably,  yeah?
 
Rosaire  Sirois:  But  anyway,  there  was  a certain  place  and
 
every,  [unintelligible], people that had them telephones,  they had
 
a certain place,  either the barn or the house:  they'd put a flag
 
up; whenever, the ring, the telephone would ring, up'd go the flag;
 
so anybody that was on the river  [Saint John River],  or about to
 
come on the river,  they'd buy themselves a binoculars too so that
 
they could see;  and,  if the flag was up,  they wouldn't come on the
 
river;  I mean on the  ice,  because  it was  ice  in the winter;  but
 
just as  soon as  the  flag went down,  [Mr.  Sirois,  while making a
 
hissing noise,  brings his hands together,  then rapidly slides his
 
palms past each other in a "getaway" gesture],  and they'd smuggle
 
them potatoes  there now,  and they'd  bring them  over  across,  the

Rosaire Sirois:
 And another thing to it that I want to bring
 
you up to: twice in my lifetime,  I seen, road being opened by being
 
packed; had a big roller,  it was about six or eight feet high,  and
 
they'd pull that in the middle of the road,  a big road,  and they'd
 
pack the snow way down; and,  it took probably four or f
 ive teams of
 
horses  to  pull,  that  roller,  and  whenever  they'd  come  to  a,
 
gentleman there now,  a farmer that'd have a team of horses,  they'd
 
unleash,  the horse ahead,  the two,  the team of horse ahead,  and
 
they'd put that one right over here so;  in other words,  whenever,
 
they'd put a new team,  the one that was on the head end would go
 
home because held be the furthest away from home, you see? So that,
 
[the reason that?],  that way
 
in  the  audience] .
.. just  like  it  was,  it  happened,  yesterday,  I
 
always was amazed at that, because they'd follow the wind, you see,
 
they didn't want the wind to,  blow
 
Rosaire Sirois:
 And another thing,  too,  that I remember my
 
father telling me:  this was;  that  in the month of March;  it was
 
unusual now neither, during a tough winter, it wasn't unusual there
 
now to get a storm of two or three days; right in succession;  snow
 
and then the wind and everything; we don't get that no more today;
 
and, people was,  built their house and they'd always have a window
 
on the second floor so they could,  open the window;  so they'd be,
 
make it easy, to be able to go out,  from that window; to be able to
 
go out  and  shovel the  entrance,  to the  [unintelligible];  but we
 
don't have no more  snow  like  that because,  the  snow today,  it's
 
altogether  different,  it's  altogether different;  now we  got  the
 
plows,  and,  we got,  a whole pile of rigging there now to open the
 
roads and then we don't have the snow that,  we used to have; when
 
I was young and when my father was coming up too, he was telling me
 
that
 the
 storm
 was
 much
 worse
 at
 that
 time,
 much,
 much
 
[unintelligible]  now
 
Rosaire Sirois:  And,  what else do I have to talk about here?
 
Oh,  about  invention:  now another  thing there  now  in the Valley;
 
nobody ever gave us any credit for invention;  now,  Oneil Lapointe
 
[my spelling],  in Van Buren; back in the nineteen forties, he's the
 
one that invented,  the first harvester;  for three years in a row,
 
on the Madore road, he got his potatoes out of the ground, with his
 
family;  and  he  had burlap  bags,  I seen him myself;  didn't want
 
nobody to see him digging potato,  how he was going;  every now and
 
then,  a barrel  of  potatoes  would  come  out  at  the  end  of  the
 
platform;  Champion  Manufacturing  Company  from  Schenectady,  New
 
York,  found out  that there was  a fellow up  in Aroostook County,
 
that had  invented,  a harvester;  so they come up,  with a pile of
 
money I take it,  they must have talked nice to him and everything;
 
they gave him a hundred dollars a week;  they moved his
family to
 
Schenectady,  New York to  set up  an assembly  line,  to make their
 
harvesters; and he's the one that started it,  never got no credit
 
Rosaire Sirois:
 Yesterday,  I was over to--Oneil's dead now,
 
and  his  wife  too  is  dead;  he  must  have  some  kids  around  there
 
because;  [unintelligible],  they must be around--because I stopped
 
over to Joe Lapointe; Joe Lapointe in Van Buren is his brother and
 
he's  eighty-four  years  old;  and  he  told  me,  he  says,  "You're
 
telling the truth; that's exactly the way it happened"; so there's
 
a number  of  inventions  in  the  Valley  that  was  invented  by  the
 
people;  of Acadian descent,  some of them,  are probably related to
 
you people somewhere along the line and,  never got no credit
 
Rosaire Sirois:
 Another thing that was invented: the barrel;
 
also, a hoist, to lift the barrel, to put it on the tractor;  in the
 
old days there now,  I remember the,  a big farmer like the Parent
 
Brothers,  Bilier  [my spelling],  Joe Lapointe,  Reed  [my spelling]
 
from Fort Fairfield, they used to hire,  six,  sometimes twelve men;
 
and they'd  lift this barrel;  and that's all they'd do,  all Fall;
 
lift them barrels and put them on the truck,  to take them to the
 
potato  house,  you  see?  And,  this  has  been  changed,  now;  Eddie
 
Doucet worked for the Frank [
?] Brothers,  and he invented a hoist;
 
the first hoist he invented run off of batteries;  you can,  state
 
that;  maybe Leon can, state that too, Leon Sirois right there [Mr.
 
Sirois points out Mr. Leon Sirois, who is seated in the audience];
 
a vacuum; now the first time was a; the first thing was a battery,
 
a vacuum;  and then the second,  they improved as they went along,
 
you  see?
 And  at  the  end  there  now,  a power  drive,  and  now,
 
whenever they want to, lift a barrel like that, they've got a hoist
 
right on the, tractor, and it would grab the barrel; to have a man,
 
to run with the,  with the grapple,  the grapple on the barrel and
 
lift it right up
 
Rosaire  Sirois:
 But  now  everything  is  mechanical;  now,  I
 
would venture,  outside of ten or fifteen years,  now that we've got
 
the harvesters and everything,  in ten or fifteen years there won't
 
be no more baskets, cause they hardly use no more baskets now; and,
 
in ten or fifteen years, there won't be no more barrels [Mr. Sirois
 
raps  his  knuckles  on  the  potato  barrel  which  he  has  brought  to
 
display];  so,  if you people want to  really,  buy yourself  a nice
 
barrel,  and take  it home  [audience  laughs],  because  it  comes  in
 
hand,  it,  comes in handy
 
Rosaire Sirois  [flipping through the pages  of a small  black
 
notepad]:  Now let me look at a little,  I got a little list of the
 
things that I wanted to say...  [someone from audience points out
 
the  sausage  stuffer]  oh  yes!  This  thing  right  here  [Mr.  Sirois
 
points to a hand-powered sausage stuffer which he has brought to
 
display],  my God!  I'm glad  you reminded me  of  it;  looks  like  a
 
pump;  another thing there now that we haven't got no more,  we got
 
no more chickens,  no more cows,  and,  no more pigs!
 We used to get
 
up  in the morning there now and we could hear the chicken there
 
now,  crowing. .  .you don't hear that no more; we don't hear the cow
 
there  now,  when  they  want  to  mate,
 in  the  month  of  August,
 
especially; you don't hear that no more; and then, we don't have no
 
pigs,  and we all had pigs,  the ones especially in the country; we
 
always raised one or two pigs; we didn't have no refrigerator,  we
 
always waited til the month of November;  dans  le, dans  le  [cru?]  
temps; it's  what  they  call  right  before  Lent;  this  [Mr.  Sirois
 
points to the sausage stuffer],  is nothing else but a,  a [saucer?]
 
maker; un faiseur de boudin [several "ahhs" of recognition from the
 
audience]; you use blood,  and the spices and everything, and you'd
 
put  your,  [casing?]  right  here,  and  you'd  put  your  ingredients
 
right in there,  and you'd push it out,  and then you'd snap it up
 
and tie  it up with a,  twine or whatever;  it makes  some  sausages
 
about that  long  [Mr.  Sirois  holds  his  hands  about twelve  inches
 
apart];  because I remember my mother used to make it in a funnel;
 
she'd take a funnel there now and she'd be poking there now  [Mr.
 
Sirois  imitates  the poking motion];  and they'd pull  on  it there
 
now,  and,  it  was  a tough  job;  but,  I got  this  from  Mr.  Roger
 
Belanger on the,  Route Eleven,  in Fort Kent; and he let me have it
 
for me to show you people,  so,  any other questions?
 
Rosaire Sirois:
 Any questions there now at any time,  if you
 
feel like-- [woman from audience points to an item (not part of Mr.
 
Sirois'  display)
 lying  on  one  of  the  tables  in  front  of  the
 
audience and asks what it is]  You mean this?  [Mr.  Sirois points to
 
the object]  I don't know [audience laughs]
 
Rosaire Sirois:  Now,  let me bring you up on,  place,  names of
 
places  that  we  got  in Aroostook  County,  well,  not  in Aroostook
 
County,  in the Valley [Mr.  Sirois refers to his notepad]; I got it
 
written down here,  somewhere.
.
.  it's coming, be patient.. .La p'tite
  
montagne, Flat Mountain,  that's on the top of Ste.  Agathe, a lot
 
of people probably don't know,  or maybe  some of  you people that
 
know;  Le  rang  des  boeufs; that  was  another  name,  Le  rang  des
  
boeufs, Leon probably knows about it  [Mr.  Sirois  is referring to
 
Mr. Leon Sirois of St. Agatha, Me., who is seated in the audience];
 
they used to have,  ox,  in them days,  and then they called  it Le
 
rang
 des boeufs; La poche d'ours, the bear's bag  [laughter from
 
the audience];  how it came about I don't know,  I asked;  they told
 
me there now that there was  a,  whole pile of  bears,  around that
 
area so they called it La poche d'ours; Brise-culottes is another
 
one [more laughter from the audience]; they got it on the map; from
 
Breechlock  [my spelling];  Breechlock,  that's what they called it;
 
but the first name was Brise-culotte; that's the short-cut on the
 
Cleveland Road,  to go to Frenchville,  right,  Leon? Brise-culotte
  
Rosaire  Sirois:
 Caswell,  the name  of  a place;  at Caswell,
 
there was another place
 they used to---in Caswell,  they used to
 
call it, Cache-canaille; Hide-the-thief, that's what, you translate
 
that in English,  that's what it meant;  the name came about I was
 
told, that the people from Grand Falls, whenever they'd pull a fast
 
one,  they wanted  to  stay,  get  away  from the  cops;  they'd  cross
 
over,  the line;  and the line  [Alberts?],  you open the back door,
 
you  could  urinate  in  Canada  [more  laughter  from  the  audience],
 
because the line is right there; and so them fellows there now,  to
 
get away,  from the law;  [unintelligible],  they had to pull a trick
 
or something there now, either they were being chased or something;
 
they'd move over to,  Caswell,  and they'd say,  "Ii  a été a
 Cache-
canaille," he's  been to  Cache-canaille,  he's  been,  to the  place
 
where,  the thief
 s hang around  [unintelligible]
 
Rosaire Sirois:
 There's another place that, going to Hamlin,
 
going up a hill at that, what we call at,  a
 la Ligne, at the Line;
 
La cOte a
 Xavier Croc; the hill,  they call  it,  Xavier Croc;  they
 
named it there now after a fellow by the name,  his  last name was
 
Croc, and his first name was Xavier; Xavier [Mr.  Sirois anglicizes
 
the  pronunciation  of  the  name];  so  they  called  it  Xavier  Croc,
 
because,  that area,  that's where this gentleman  lived,  so;  and I
 
always thought there now that he was a Cyr;  but his last name was
 
Croc,  I was,  straightened out on that
 
Rosaire Sirois:  Now on that, piece of road,  on that, hill out
 
there; there's another place where they call,  La vide poche, Empty
 
Bag; how that name came about;  a gentleman there now was planting
 
his oats; and when he come over to plant his oats,  it was close to
 
lunchtime,  so he removed his oats from his wagon,  and he took,  he
 
went to the,  barn with his horse, because the horses in them days,
 
you used to take an hour,  an hour and-a-half,  sometimes two hours,
 
for lunch,  right  [Ghyslain?]  [Mr.  Sirois addressed this remark to
 
an acquaintance  seated  in the audience];  and,  while he was  gone
 
there now, while the horse were eating, he come back,  and his bags
 
were still there,  but the oats was gone;  so they call that area,
 
Vide poche [laughter from audience],  Empty Bag
 
[A member of the audience addresses a question to Mr. Sirois]:
 
Is  it  true  that  in  the  early  times,  you were  talking  about  the
 
horses,  the French,  descendants,  well they hated the English for
 
what they had done to them so much they used to name their horses
 
[Mr.  Sirois responds:  English]  with English names?
 
Rosaire Sirois [nodding in affirmation]: Jim,  Bob, Nelly,  and
 
[Frank?]  [audience  laughs];  they hated the  English  so much  that
 
they never call  one of their horses by their French name;  we had
 
some home there now;  there was Bob and Jim,  Bob and Jim  [someone
 
from  audience  calls  out  a  couple  of  other  English  names  for
 
horses];  English,  all English names;  never a French name; because
 
we hated the English and that was handed down to us  [someone from
 
the audience initiates a subject:  So when they used to beat them,
 
too]
 
Rosaire  Sirois:  Oh!  Let  me  tell  you  another  story  about
 
beating a horse;  ii y avait un  [matéon  de  joual?; my spelling],
 
matéon de loual is a guy that's hard on his horses;  and,  he had a
 
mare;  and she had a calf,  a colt,  it's kind of hard to say it in
 
French--you see,  when I first went to school when I was six years
 
old I couldn't  say a word of,  yes or no,  in English,  so this  is
 
all
—
 and 
. and if I make mistakes,  excuse me--but anyway,  this fellow,
 
had  a horse,  and,  a mare,  and  she gave  birth  to  a colt,  and he
 
beat, well he beat her for nothing at all; and the colt, got beaten
 
too;  but after  four or  five years,  for some reason or other,  he
 
sold the horse to  a neighbor,  out there,  and,  that horse hated,
 
that gentleman, to no end; finally that gentleman died; and when he
 
died,  in them days they used to,  expose your body  in the house;
 
that is,  we didn't have,  a funeral home like you got today;  and,
 
the morning of the funeral, the gentleman that ran the hearse, that
 
was,  he had that young colt,  she was  about seven or eight years
 
old;  had a harness and she was on the hearse;  and when they took
 
that gentleman out of the house, that horse never wanted to move an
 
inch; she just,  jumped in the air; the smell of that gentleman, she
 
remembered that because she had been away from that horse [I think
 
Mr. Sirois perhaps means to refer to the colt's original owner] for
 
about  four  or  five  years,  and  she  remembered  the  smell  of  that
 
horse;  and  they  had  to,  unharness  the  horse  and  take  her  away
 
because she,  didn't want move at all;  ain't that the mystery?
 
Huh?
 And that happened in the Valley;  and I know the people,  but
 
I wouldn't want to mention by names [some laughter from audience],
 
because,  there's  some  of  the,  descendants  [cough  from  audience
 
obscures a couple of words]  [are still here?]

about  smuggling:  now  smuggling,  I did  mention  something  about
 
smuggling  but;  this  gentleman  was  smuggling  "hand  brand"

with the story he just told]

smuggled
 
[Same member  of  the  audience  as  above  explains  that  he was
 
curious because his son is a sergeant in the police force; audience
 
laughs ]
 
Rosaire Sirois:  Oh;  I smuggled hide one time,  that  is,  beef
 
hide [car horn blows from outside], for a [unintelligible] ; another
 
thing to we did during high school when we needed some money:  in
 
them days when we crossed the river,  there was,  the road wasn't,
 
plowed way down to the surface; and would used to make ruts,  there
 
was two sets  of  ruts going to Canada and two  sets  of ruts would
 
come over to this way;  so,  we'd buy liquor from across the river
 
(Saint John River]  at a cheaper price than we could sell  it over
 
here; we'd tie a string,  in the back,  and the light at the custom
 
house was kind of dim,  poor;  and,  we'd walk there now,  we'd go by
 
the  customs  and  that  bottle would  be  about  [Mr.  Sirois  imitates
 
walking by the customs house; audience laughs],  twenty feet behind
 
you  [more  laughter  from audience];  wave to the custom,  I did  it
 
myself,  wave to the  custom officer;  and,  hope  there now that he
 
goes  back  in;  while  the  bottle  is  going  by  [more  laugher  from
 
audience]; because,  the bottle is in the rut,  in the rut,  and it's
 
following you [more laughter from the audience] ; I did that myself ;

Rosaire Sirois:  Hotter now than it was then,  much hotter; we
 
never used to have humidity at all;  I remember when I was a kid,
 
the humidity wasn't around at all;  if we did have humidity,  it was
 
only a matter of a day or two,  at the most;  and,  the summers are
 
much warmer,  and the winters are much  [unintelligible]
 
Rosaire Sirois:
 And another thing too we used to have:  one
 
rain  a winter;  January  thaw,  somewhere  around  the  twentieth  of
 
January;  now it rains every,  every month;  for whatever reason,  I
 
don't know;  [unintelligible],  and .
..
 
Rosaire Sirois: Another thing too:  they used to swear; maudit 
[second syllable pronounced as in the English word "die"];  instead
 
of  saying  "
inaudit" 
[second  syllable  pronounced  with  customary
 
French "i"]  they'd say "maudit" [second syllable pronounced as in
 
the  English  word  "die"];  Jesus  Croche; Gosh  darn:  that was  God
 
damn;  excuse the expression,  but they used that,  you
 see?  Sacre
 
bleue is another one; yes Ma'am [acknowledging a question from the
 
audience]
 
[Woman in the audience asks Mr.  Sirois if he's going to make
 
a tape of his presentation]
 
Rosaire Sirois  [pointing to Lisa Ornstein,  who  is recording
 
the presentation]:  She's taping that right now,  I guess;  why? Do
 
you want  a tape?  [Mr.  Sirois  laughs];  Lisa's  taping  it  I think
 
there now
 
Rosaire Sirois:  Un coureux: a runner, was a woman chaser; une
  
courailleu[sel, that was the women who [laughter from audience] was
 
running;  [addressing member of the audience]  right,  Mrs.  Sirois?
 
Elle  pet  plus  haut  que  le  trou; [audience  laughs];  [Mr.  Sirois
 
translates]  she poops higher than the hole;  she's trying to build
 
herself up [audience laughs; Mr. Sirois coughs, clears his throat]
 
Rosaire Sirois:
 There was classes,  among the Acadians there
 
was,  certain people there now that thought they were higher than
 
others;  but  I happened  to  be  at  the  bottom  of  the  rung;  I was
 
brought up there now where,  my father was working for a dollar a
 
day  if he could get a job;  and the mop would be  sticking to the
 
floor;  to the,  at the  [unintelligible];  and,  we never had no wood
 
ahead,  we didn't have no money enough  in the  summertime to have
 
wood ahead;  we'd  saw wood on  Saturday,  for the week;  my brother
 
used to do that,  on the buck saw; go away my health,  come my money
 
[Mr.  Sirois imitates the forward-backward motion of sawing with a
 
bucksaw as  he  speaks];  [audience  laughs]  vas-t'en ma  sante puis
  
viens-t-en mon argent [more laughter from audience]; that was the,
 
trend, there was a lot of people in there that was, better off than
 
we were,  but  we  were,  the majority,  because  there  was  a lot  of
 
people like us
 
Rosaire Sirois: And beans was being eaten there now; that was
 
a steady diet;  pain sucré was another thing that we used to have,
 
when  I used  to  go  to  get molasses  across  the  river  [Saint  John
 
River]  for twenty-five cents  a gallon;  du pain  sucré; and then,
 
buckwheat,  ploves; and I still love them today;  chicken stew,  and
 
buckwheat ployes; and,  I never go,  less than twenty-five pounds in
 
a pail that  I got  in the attic;  less than twenty-five pounds  in
 
buckwheat  flour,  because  if  I wouldn't  be  getting,  I can't  eat
 
chicken  stew  without,  ployes; I can't  eat  a roast  beef,  brown
 
potatoes,  gravy,  a roast beef and a little bit of pork;  I got to
 
have my ploves; and my wife happens  to  be,  a Bouchard  from  St.
 
David  and  she's  the  best  cook  in  the  world  [audience  laughs
 
appreciatively];  she's not here now  [Mr.  Sirois laughs]
 
Rosaire Sirois  [looking through his notepad]:  Well let's see
 
here;  oh!  Let me tell you  about another thing too:  when  I first
 
started to,  go door-to-door in the summertime--you see,  I used to
 
work on the railroad in the wintertime,  they'd lay me off  in the
 
summer  so  I'd  sell  patent medicine door-to-door;  and  other,  pie
 
filling  and  spices,  hand  lotion  and  things  like  that--on  the
 
Beaulieu Road coming into,  Cleveland Road there now where Mister,
 
Mister and Misses Sirois,  Leon Sirois lives over there,  there was
 
a gentleman out there and they were very stubborn,  well-to-do--I
 
won't name his name--and,  Maine Public,  the electricity was  just
 
coming out at that time,  Le chemin du roi; another thing too,  the
 
main highway was named the chemin du roi, the king's road,  huh?
 
Rosaire Sirois: They, wanted, them people around there wanted
 
electricity because they didn't have electricity at that time,  at
 
that particular time;  so,  they started there now to put the poles
 
on the Beaulieu Road, and in Ste. Agathe they'd come out to, on the
 
Cleveland Road;  and when they got to this  certain gentleman,  he
 
wanted so much money; more than the other people there now, to put
 
the posts in his cow pastures so that,  they could get electricity;
 
now this guy was one of the heavyweights around that area,  I mean
 
heavyweights,  he  had  money;  and  very  stubborn  too,  I knew  him
 
personally  there;  he  died  not  too  long  ago,
 at  the  age  of
 
[unintelligible]
 
Rosaire  Sirois:
 But  anyway,  coming  back  to  my  story,  the
 
Maine Public put posts way up to his,  cow pasture,  from one side;
 
and then from the Cleveland Road they come up, from the other side;
 
and  the  people  around,
 on  the  Beaulieu  Road,
 and  where  this
 
gentleman was,  they all started to wire their houses,  buy washing
 
machines;  because the ladies were washing.
.
. rub board there now,
 
you know,  one  of  them  things  there  now,  and  they were  tired  of
 
doing  that,  and  they  knew  that  some  people  on  the  main  highway
 
were,  had a washing machine and it was saving them a lot of work
 
and everything; but anyway, Maine Public was stuck: didn't want to
 
pay what this gentleman wanted to, get paid for, and this and that;
 
it went on like that for two years;  so this lady,  from that,  area
 
out there, she had bought a washing machine, her, their barns were,
 
all wired up,  their house was all wired up and she wanted to know
 
why they weren't getting electricity; so she went to, the people of
 
the Maine Public,  she wanted to know;  she said,  Well,  Maine,  the
 
fellows  from Maine Public told him,  told her  that,  this  certain
 
gentleman there  now wanted  so much money;  for  so many posts";  I
 
guess he had,  five,  telephone,  five poles to put
 
Rosaire Sirois:  So anyway,  one thing led to another; she says
 
to the Maine, the gentleman at the Maine Public, she says,  "How can
 
you
 [remember?]
 that?"
 There's
 only
 one
 way;
 we,
 we
 
[unintelligible];  "When,  election time comes,"  she says,  "talk to
 
the moderator"; and it was all fixed between the moderator and this
 
woman, and this gentleman that refused Maine Public to pass posts,
 
he didn't know anything about it; and he was kind of the gentleman
 
that always went to the,  to the,  petite école, in them days they
 
used to have,  meeting there now,  the town meeting,  in the petite
 
école, they didn't have no school at,  that particular day;  and he
 
used to sit in the front seat;  so anyway, when the tim e came there
 
now,  this  lady  got up  and  she  says,  "How's  that we  haven't  got
 
electricity?"  She  says,
 "My  house  is  wired,  I got  a,  washing
 
machine,  I'm  ready";  the  moderator,  he  already  knew  the  story,
 
about everything there now,  he says,  "Well,  this gentleman is the
 
one that,  sitting in the front pew,  the front desk,  he's the one
 
that's stopping the whole thing";  she had a handbag and she had a
 
handbag loaded with rocks  [audience murmurs and laughs]; he didn't
 
know anything about this;  she just grabbed a hold of that handbag
 
and she hit the desk;  and she says to him,  "You're the one that's
 
stopping it";  she says,  "Did you hear that noise I made with that
 
handbag?"  Oh,  [golly?]  he was  all  scared to death then;  and  she
 
says,  "The next swing is around your head,  if you don't promise us,
 
that you're going to  let Maine Public,  through";
 the next  day,
 
Maine Public was digging there  [more laughter from the audience]
 
Rosaire Sirois:
 Another thing there that dawned on me there
 
now:  when I was a kid, anybody that went to Houlton, went to jail;
 
[laughter from the audience]  Houlton was about,  somebody's not in
 
their head; I'm telling the truth, right? And if he'd go to Bangor,
 
he'd go to the nut house  [more laughter from the audience];  that
 
was the same
 
Rosaire  Sirois:
 Now,  to  go  to  Caribou  from Van  Buren,  my
 
father was telling me,  that  it took anywheres from four,  to five
 
days; twenty-two miles; for travel; now there's a lot of places in,
 
in the woods, we called, between Van Buren and Caribou, the swamps;
 
and whenever they'd go to Caribou, they'd bring [Mr.  Sirois pounds
 
one of the fence rails which he has brought in for display] half-a-
dozen,  maybe  a dozen,  or  maybe  two  dozen  of  them  things;  and
 
whenever they'd  come to  a place where  it was hard going,  they'd
 
throw them logs,  in front,  so that they can go by;  and the log was
 
wet;  muddy  and  everything;  lots  of  times  they'd  leave  it  right
 
there; because there was some [other go home?]; and everybody that
 
went to Caribou in them days,  back in the nineteen hundred,  first
 
part  of  nineteen  hundred;  they'd  bring  them,  les  pichets [Mr.
 
Sirois pounds on one of the fence rails which he has brought in for
 
display];  what they call,  this  [unintelligible];  and,  right now,
 
they're working that road out there,  and,  I bet you a dollar to,  a
 
doughnut,  that  twenty  feet  underneath there now  there's  some  of
 
them [pichets] because this  [tape recording ends]
 
[END SIDE ONE,  MAP-LO-All;  CONTINUED ON SIDE TWO]
 
SIDE TWO:
 
[As
 recording
 begins,
 Mr.
 Sirois
 is
 concluding
 his
 
presentation,  and audience is applauding]
 
Rosaire Sirois:
 .
..twelve fifteen  [audience applauds];  this
 
afternoon,  at our next one,  if you feel like coming,  I'll probably
 
show you my invention; I got a tire chain you don't have to get out
 
of your car to put them on,  take them off,  and I never was able to
 
get it to the market; and I bet you,  a dollar to a doughnut that in
 
ten years,  it'll be on the market, because I' ve,  contacted a lot of
 
companies;  and  I've  got  it  right  here,  and  I'll  show  it  to  you
 
later

MAINE ACADIAN CULTURE SURVEY
 
AUDIOCASSETTE RECORDING LOG
 
RECORDED 6/28/91 by LISA ORNSTEIN
 
This entry logs a single 60-minute audiocassette tape  documenting
 
"Les  violons  d' Acadie,"  an  evening  of  traditional  instrumental
 
music and dance,  recorded at the Multi Purpose Center in Madawaska,
 
Me.  on the evening of 28 June 1991.
 
ALSO PRESENT:  Ray Brassieur,  David Whitman.
 
RECORDING LOCATION:  Recording apparatus was set up in the audience
 
area on a table located approximately forty yards from the stage.
 
PERFORMER  LOCATION:
 Performers  addressed  audience  from  a large
 
raised stage located on the northern side of the building.
 
RECORDING  SET-UP:
 Maranz  audiocassette  tape  recorder  with  two
 
Sennheiser microphones with cardioid heads mounted on a microphone
 
jig attached to a stand.
 
TAPE BIAS:
 Normal.
 
NOISE REDUCTION:
 Dolby B on.
 
RECORDING
 PROBLEMS:
 Room
 acoustics
 and
 changes
 in
 stage
 
amplification  set-ups made  for  an extremely noisy,  unpredictable
 
recording environment.
 The recording conditions were so poor that
 
I decided to discontinue recording after the first tape.
 
LOG  DATA  COMMENTS:  Approximately  400-500  people  attended  this
 
event.  Master  of  ceremonies  (and co-organizer of the  event)  Paul
 
Leblanc  [Madawaska,  Me.]  provided  on-stage  introductions  for  the
 
performers.
 As  well  as  presenting  their  own  music,  the  "house
 
band,"  Jerry  and  the  Wanderers,  provided  accompaniment  for  the
 
majority  of  the  evening's  instrumental  performers.
 Audience
 
applauded
 following  each  performance.
 Due  to
 a  conflict
 in
 
schedule,  the field team arrived almost two hours after the event
 
had begun.
 David Whitman documented several hours of this event on
 
the Nagra open reel tape recorder. As the demands of the recording
 
situation made  it impossible to seek additional  information  from
 
the performers,  annotations are sometimes incomplete.

SONG #1:
 [untitled]
 [Source:
 Eddie Morin,  father]
 
[Incipit:  "Un jour me prit envie de deserter de France"]
 
[Note:  Mrs.  Desrosier falters at the start of the second
 
verse]
 
[Note:  This song has been catalogued by Laval University
 
song scholar Conrad Laforte under the critical title "Le
 
capitaine tue par le déserteur"  in Catalogue de la chanson
  
folklorique francaise (Quebec City:  Les Presses universitaires
 
Laval,  1958).]
 
[Note:  Canadian folklorist Marius Barbeau collected a
 
version which he titled
 "Le déserteur de France"  from Edouard
 
Hovington,  of TadoussaC  (Québec)  in 1916.  According to Barbeau's
 
notes which accompany the transcription of the music and lyrics,
 
Mr.  Hovington learned his version around 1830  (Le Rossiqnol y
 
Chante, Ottawa:  Nusées nationaux du Canada,  1979,  pp.  421-2).
 
Mrs.  Desrosier'S melody is similar to the Hovington version and
 
the lyrics are remarkably similar.
 Her version further
 
elaborates the wishes of the condemned deserter.]
 
[Mrs.  Desrosier remarks on the song]:  This was father's
 
favorite song;  but father had a powerful voice which would just
 
ring out; apparently there was grandfather  [reference to Eddie
 
Morin's maternal grandfather Isidore "Lindore" Ouellette,  who
 
Connie later described as an important source of music for Eddie
 
and his brothers]  and the lumbercamps  [reference to father's
 
learning songs at lumbercamps,  where he worked winters beginning
 
at the age of fourteen]; maybe there's a line or two missing
 
[from the song]
 
[Mrs.  Desrosier introduces song #2]:  [Many of father's
 
songs]  are about war,  so it must have been in times of turmoil;
 
wonders if I have heard the song about the lady barber  [I respond
 
that I haven't and ask her to please sing it]
 
SONG #2:  [untitled]  [Source:
 Eddie Morin,  father]
 
[Incipit:  "C'est a
 Paris,  qu' y a t'une barbière,  qu'elle
 
est cent fois plus belle que le jour"]
 
[Note:
 Mrs.  Desrosier falters during the first verse,  and
 
remarks that she should have written some of the songs down.  She
 
then picks up the song,  apparently somewhat farther along in the
 
verses.  Towards
 }r
 
son picks it up.
 
[Mrs.  Desrosier C Oj
 f
l t
 cn
 iy
 
you can tell they loved the sea;  every song includes references;
 
this was one of father's two favorites;  he had a whole repertory
 
but we've lost so much; we don't sing any more;  [I  inquire as to
 
causes];  television;  and when I was here and sang,  they'd leave
 
the house  [Connie laughs];  it's after a while that it comes back;
 
sometimes if I sing  [the old songs],  I'll hear  [people from
 
around the Valley
 
sing that song
 
[I comment that Mrs.  Desrosier's songs are wonderful; her
 
son interjects]:  I never knew my mother knew these songs
 
[Mrs.  Desrosier introduces song #3,  making reference to the
 
transcription she published along with reminiscences about her
 
father's singing,  in an article entitled "La Musique,"  in the
 
Fall 1990 Ste.  Agathe Historical Society newsletter]:  There's two
 
or three versions of this song,  but this is the one he sang
 
SONG #3:
 [untitled]
 [Source:
 Eddie Morin,  father]
 
Incipit:  "Par un beau dimanche au soir,  un soir,  m'y
 
promenant"]
 
[Note:  According to Marius Barbeau  (Romancero du Canada,
 
Montreal:  Beauchemin,  1937,  p.  113-114)  and Ronald Labelle  (La
 
fleur du rosier, Cape Breton:  Unversity College of Cape Bretton
 
Press and Canadian Museum of Civilization,  1988,  pp.  75-6),  this
 
song is as common in France as it is in Canada,  and many Acadian
 
versions have been collected.
 Conrad Laforte catalogued this
 
song under the critical title "Voilà la recom pense"  in his Le
 
catalogue de la chanson folklorique francaise, op.  cit.]
 
[Note:  Mrs.  Desrosier's melody and lyrics are very similar
 
to versions appearing in Romancero and La fleur; her lyrics are
 
somewhat more complete than the version appearing in La fleur]
 
[Mrs.  Desrosier comments on the sense of the song]:  I think
 
it depicts certain things they  [people in former times]  did and
 
how they felt;  and of course he  [father]  knew all these French
 
songs and would sing them all night long
 
[Son William interjects to request a copy of the recording
 
we're making]:  I want a copy of this cassette;  I never knew she
 
[mother]  sang so well;  it's funny that  [it's only]  after twenty-
eight years that I find this out about my mother
 
[Mrs.  Desrosier comments on musical environment at home
 
during her son's youth]:  Husband didn't grow up in a musical
 
family and so he didn't value music as important;  perceived it
 
more as a time-waster;  anecdote about how she used to have an old
 
piano which she played by ear;  she came home one day to discover
 
that her husband had dragged it to the dump,  remarking,  "tu me
 
tanneras plus avec call  [Connie laughs];  but afterwards brothers
 
and sisters used to come by afterwards and want to gather around
 
the piano for songs
 
[Son William comments that Leo James  (his maternal uncle Leo
 
James Morin)  loved to hear Connie sing;  Mrs.  Desrosier reminisces
 
about her brother's love of her singing]:  used to sing in the
 
church choir and Leo James used to come hear me sing every Xmas
 
eve for the Midnight Mass service no matter how bad the weather;
 
used to sing in the men's choir section because voice was low
 
[Mrs.  Desrosier and son begin to discuss possible plans for
 
the day and I turn off the recorder;  shortly afterwards,  several
 
friends and relatives drop by for a visit;  I arrange with Mrs.
 
Desrosier to return in the afternoon to finish up our interview
 
and record another song or two]
 
SONG #4:  [untitled]  [Source:
 unsure;  possibly from Eddie Norm ,
 
father,  or from stepmother Wellena Fongemie's mother,  Adele
 
Ouellette]
 
[Incipit:  "Père et mere m'ont mis au couvent,  c'est a
 l'âge
 
de quinze ans]
 
[Mrs.  Desrosier comments on the song]:  [laughs],  I don't
 
know if that's all of the song but that is all I can remember
 
[Mrs.  Desrosier responds to my request for clarification of
 
the meaning of the song's chorus]:  "Je briserai chambre et
 
chamnes;"  "chaines" probably means chains,  though probably not
 
actual chains;  she  [the song's heroine]  probably feels chained in
 
the room
 
[Mrs.  Desrosier speculates on song's origins]:  "I don't know
 
if this is a local,  native one;  it doesn't come from the Cahiers
  
de la bonne chanson, for sure"  [Mrs.  Desrosier laughs]

RECORDED 7/10/91 by LISA ORNSTEIN
 
This entry logs a single 60-minute audiocassette tape
 
documenting the singing and story-telling of Mrs.  Ida Bourgoin
 
Roy,  recorded at her home on Main Street  in Van Buren,  Me.,  on 10
 
July 1991.
 
ALSO PRESENT:  Nicholas Hawes  (Assistant Director,  Acadian

LOG DATA COMMENTS:
 Mrs.  Roy sang her songs from typescripts of
 
the texts.  After recording a small sampling of Mrs.  Roy's
 
singing,  I requested a story.
 Mrs.  Roy was happy to oblige but
 
expressed concern about my coming to the end of the cassette
 
before she completed her tale.  In order to ensure an
 
uninterrupted performance,  I therefore recorded the story on Side
 
Two of the cassette.

SONG #1:
 "Fox Henry"  [Source:  Alvina Marquis Bourgoin,  mother;
 
also Patrick Bourgoin,  father]
 
[Incipit:  "Il y a t'un an passé,  ma chère mere,  j'étais dans
 
un bal a
 soir"]
 
[Note:  The complete absence of rhyme,  and the somewhat
 
awkward fit between lyrics and melody in this song,  as well as
 
the song's title,  all suggest that "Fox Henry" may be a literal
 
French translation of an English-language song.]
 
[Notes:
 Mrs.  Roy described "Fox Henry" as "une chanson
 
d'exemple"  (a cautionary song),  especially for girls.
 She
 
believes that she is the only person who sings this song,  with
 
the exception of Florence Martin Laliberté,  a native of St.
 
Agatha,  Me.,  now living in Lewiston, Me..
 It is noteworthy that
 
Florence Martin Laliberté donated a handwritten collection of
 
local songs to the Ste.  Agathe Historical Society in 1990]
 
SONG #2:
 "Estroplé dans un chantier"  [Source:  Patrick Bourgoin,
 
father]
 
[Incipit:  "Toute jeunesse de campagne,  écoutez ma chanson"]
 
[Mrs.  Roy responds to my queries about the song's composer
 
and its circulation]:  I don't know where the song comes from;  I
 
never heard anyone else but my father sing it;  I've never found
 
it  [in a collection]  anywhere
 
[Note:  The melodic structure and some aspects of the textual
 
form and content of this song are characteristic of the
 
complainte, an Acadian form of the local ballad which
 
commemorates a tragic event.
 What makes this song somewhat
 
unusual as a complainte is that the victim,  though crippled,
 
survives the tragic event.  In the typical complainte, the tragic
 
event results in death.  "Estropié dans un chantier" contains some
 
classic elements of the complainte (e.g.,  the subject of the
 
ballad is presented in the first verse;  in following ones,  the
 
tragedy is described)  but others are noticeably absent  (e.g.,  a
 
cautionary comment at the end concerning man's mortality and the
 
need to be prepared for an unpredictable death).
 The statement
 
of grievance by the victim about unfair labor practices in the
 
lumber camp,  which occurs toward the end of the song,  and which
 
focusses attention on worldly problems rather than those of the
 
hereafter,  is more characteristic of the labor protest song than
 
the complainte.] 
[Note:  The last verse of "Estropié dans un chantier" names
 
"Michel Dupuis" as the song's composer/victim.]
 
SONG #3:  "La complainte des trois frères  (gui ont été dans un
 
chantier)"  [Source:  Patrick Bourgoin,  father]
 
[Incipit:  "Hélàs!  et nous,  nous étaient trois frères"]
 
[Mrs.  Roy comments after she finishes singing]:  That's a
 
beautiful song.
.
.  [short unintelligible phrase]
 
[Note:  This complainte describes the tragic death of a young
 
logger who slips on the rocks,  is carried off into the river
 
rapids,  and is finished off by murderous Indians.  The text
 
includes all of the customary formulaic elements of the classic
 
complainte described in notes to the previous song.  There is a
 
place name reference to a river in the song  (unknown to me and
 
I'm unsure of its spelling).]
 
SONG #4:
 "La mort du colonel; voilà le vingt-cinq du moiS"
 
[Source:  Patrick Bourgoin,  father]
 
[Note:  This song has been catalogued by Laval University
 
song scholar Conrad Laforte under the critical title "La mort du
 
Colonel"  in Catalogue de la chanson folklorique francaise (Quebec
 
City:  Les Presses universitaires Laval,  1958).  Marius Barbeau
 
published a critical version of the text in his book Le Rossignol
  
y Chante (Ottawa:  Imprimeur de la Reine,  1962)  under the title
 
"Le dix d'avril."
 Barbeau's notes suggest that the song was in
 
fairly wide circulation in the Saint Lawrence Valley of Quebec in
 
the early decades of the twentieth century,  particularly in the
 
Gaspésie regions on the north shore of the Baie-de-Chaleur and
 
around Port-Daniel.
 Compared to Barbeau's critical text,  Mrs.
 
Roy's version presents a slightly sketchy first two verses,
 
followed by a very similar and essentially complete set of
 
lyrics.]
 
[END SIDE ONE,  MAP-LO-A014;  CONTINUED ON SIDE TWO]
 
STORY:
 "Ti-Jean et les trois chiens"
 
[Note -
-
 Story Synopsis/Translation:  This story relates how
 
Ti-Jean,  who lives with his widowed mother,  trades the family cow
 
for three dogs:  Tout Fort,  Tout Raide,  and Garde ton Maitre.  The
 
dogs are offered to him by an old man,  who promises that they
 
will provide more abundant food for the family than the cows.
 
Ti-Jean brings home the dogs,  and the next day he sends them out
 
foraging in the food shops in town;  the dogs successfully raid
 
and return uncaptured with the food.
 
After having stocked his mother's larder,  Ti-Jean leaves
 
with his dogs to seek a job.  He goes through the woods.  He comes
 
upon a beautiful princess seated on a throne,  who warns him to
 
not pass,  for danger of being eaten by the seven-headed beast.
 
Ti-Jean would like to marry the princess;  she tells him to do so
 
he must kill the beast.
 Others have tried and failed.
 For the
 
next two mornings,  Ti-Jean sends one of his dogs to fight the
 
beast;  on the third morning,  he sends all three dogs and they
 
kill the beast.
 The princess gives Jean her monogrammed
 
handkerchief to wrap up the tongues of the dead beast,  as future
 
proof to the king that he is its killer.
 
Ti-Jean goes on to the city where he takes a room at the
 
home of an poor old lady.  He finds out that the king is having a
 
feast at which he plans to determine which of the princess's
 
suitors professing to have killed the beast is the legitimate
 
claimant.  Ti-Jean sends his dogs one by one to the castle to
 
bring back food.
 The dogs accomplish their mission,  to the
 
surprise of the assembly  (except the princess,  who recognizes the
 
dogs).  The third time,  the king sends a runner after the dog to
 
invite its owner to sup with the assembly.
 
Ti-Jean goes to the castle.  The king asks who has proof that
 
they killed the seven-headed beast.  One claimant has collected
 
the heads of the beast as proof;  another has
 -
-
 (Mrs.  Roy unable
 
to remember).
 Ti-Jean shows the beast's tongues to the king.  The
 
king responds by giving him the princess in marriage.  Ti-Jean
 
also receives permission to bring his mother to the castle to
 
live and they all live happily ever after.]

too long since I told the story
