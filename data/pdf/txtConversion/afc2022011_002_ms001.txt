Interviewee English:   
First, when I was still little, I was hearing from the old ladies 
that we weave lavalava, and I saw them doing the weaving. At 
times, I went down to the women’s house with my mom and I 
saw them weaving lavalava. The women gathered and 
preparing local threads, like banana and hibiscus fibers, for the 
weaving. Those were the things I saw them doing during those 
days.  
 
When I became a little bigger and had my first period, my 
mother gave me and my sister a basket (hapas) and told my 
older sister to take me down to the women’s house. At the 
women house, she gave me the basket (hapas) now that I was 
a grown lady. Now, I could start learning how to split and 
connect fibers. That’s when I started splitting and tying the 
fibers. Afterwards, they also showed me how they dyed the 
fibers. They took a pot and put dye in it, and they boiled it with 
water and then put the fibers into the pot. They boiled the fiber 
together with the dye, and they told me to do it. After dyeing 
the fiber, they told me to take it to the ocean and rinse it off 
and bring back to the women’s house and hang it up to dry. 
After a few days of drying the colored fiber, they told me to 
weave, and they gave me a warping board. I started putting 
the fiber around the warping board pegs from one end of the 
warping board to the other end. This is when I learned how to 
weave, and to complete the weaving.  
 
Petra is the one who told me how to use the warping board by 
putting down the sticks. Petra came and taught me how to 
install the sticks on the warping board. 
3 
 
 
So, they showed me how to weave. I watched and observed 
when they put the warp on the loom (pap) and they started 
putting in the loom gears (thib – pattern sticks, ngung – heddle 
stick, tapang – shed rod). They spread out the fibers on the 
loom and they told me to sit down at the loom. 
 
That is when I sat at the loom. They started to teach me how to 
weave by teaching me all the movements of the different 
pieces of the loom. In doing so, I kept making mistakes, but 
they were there correcting my mistakes. At times I dropped the 
weaving sword (hopop) and it fell, but I kept on learning how to 
weave with their help until I was able to do it by myself. That is 
when I learned how to do it and start weaving. 
 
During those times, the thread was hard to come by. In those 
times, I didn’t have thread, and I saw people buying it from 
Father Walter (a catholic priest) that lived on the island. It took 
about a year or so before I got my first thread. Now I can buy 
thread, so now I’m weaving using thread.  
 
Now, I know how to make the warp by myself from the 
beginning to the end, to start the warp, put it on the warping 
board, and spread the fiber out. So, knowing how to warp and 
weave, I continue to weave and I give lavalava to my mom to 
keep and give to others when they need and to have if there is 
a funeral. Having lavalava on hand to keep and give when 
there is a need is what we refer to as “Matel Paiyi”. That is 
what my mom does. If she doesn’t use them, she will keep 
them for when something comes up. 
07:45 Question 2 
2.   In your mind, who is the one person you most associate with weaving in your life and 
why? 
A. Ulithian:  Lol yam luluwal, itei semal le ye kael yam fel ngali irel yam fefaru doh deur hare

Interviewee English: 
It was me and Petra Lemag; we were helping each other out. 
She’s the one who taught me weaving. She was good to me 
because she explained the weaving clearly and we wove 
together. 
 
When I came to a point where I couldn’t understand the next 
step of what to do with the weaving, she would come to explain 
the next few steps I needed in order to continue weaving in the 
right way. This was when she explained how I should deal with 
broken fibers and how to reconnect threads. 
 
There was one lady staying in a house close to us, also. She 
also talked to me in a good way. At times I went to her and 
asked her things I needed to know. Like, “why does this white 
thread go this way, and when the black thread goes that way, 
what does that mean? And when the black thread crosses over 
the other thread, what does that mean?” 
 
The lady I was staying with, who was like my mom, when I 
asked her a question she would not really explain it well but 
would turn around and say, “you don’t know what I said before 
to do?” She would scold me, and I ended up being more 
confused. 
So, Petra was my sister that knew how to weave, and we lived 
together. Staying together was very good and we enjoyed what 
we were doing together, each one of us would get on her loom 
(deur). We would weave, and when there was something that 
went wrong with my weaving, she would tell me what I needed 
to do.

Interviewee English: 
Weaving is important to me because that is what I wear and 
it’s something that belongs to me. I own and keep the lavalava 
in the event someone comes who needs them, and I have 
them to give. 
And, it’s something that is like money to me. I use them for 
funerals, and they are also something for me to wear. We use 
lavalava for a lot of things, like for my kids, relatives, and even 
my parents. 
It’s embarrassing when one of my relatives or children die and 
I have nothing to put on them. Or when a brother of mine 
comes from outside (off island) and I don’t give him a lavalava.  
Or, if one of my nieces comes from afar and I have nothing to 
give her to change into. Especially if it is the daughter of my 
brother. This is something that is very important in our culture.  
Weaving lavalava is very important in our culture.  It’s 
something that we must have. Lavalava is called “Gow”. 
13:30 Question 4 
4.   How has weaving or woven skirts changed over your lifetime, or since the lifetime of 
those who taught you? 
A.   Ulithi:  Ifa sangal yal deur mo dedeur susuwel doh irel yam bubudoh yesa holadoh igla?

Interviewee English: 
What I know is that, back in the day, we used one color for the 
bigger stripe (the bigger strip is what we called “Gur”) and we 
used another color for the smaller stripe (the smaller stripe is 
called Poth).  Now it’s changing.  There are more colors that 
people use these days.  I know there’s “Machi”* and there is 
“Peig”* that we weave in supplemental weft designs (fichi). 
Nowadays, people can weave in their names, or weave in 
flowers, birds, or other designs.  There are lavalava patterns 
that I see nowadays that are so much different than the old 
days, and I don’t know how to make them. 
(*Interviewer Note: "Machi" is a plain color lavalava that we weave supplemental weft 
designs (fichi) into with a pointed stick made out of metal or wood.  We put designs into 
the whole length of the Machi, but only certain designs. "Peig" is a plain color lavalava 
with a stripe of different color in the middle. We also weave designs into this style of 
lavalava, but only at the ends.)    
 
16:01 Question 5  
5.    If you could talk to your great-granddaughter about weaving, what would you want to tell 
her? 
A.   Ulithian:  Hare wochog bo hobe malili ngal lol lom tarfefel irel deur, mada mele hobe

Interviewee English: 
I would like to tell them that weaving is very important.  I would 
like them to learn weaving so they can be like me and know 
how to weave. For most of the things that happen here in the 
community, the woven skirt (deur) is what we give in terms of 
funerals, to relatives that just came from traveling, for 
peacemaking, and also they are used as money.   
Even if people are not wearing the woven skirt anymore, they 
still have to know how to weave them so they can have them 
for other purposes.  I would really like them to know how to 
weave, so in case I die they know how to weave.
