George Collins rode home one dark stormy night George Collins rode home so gay
George Collins rode home one dark stormy night And he lay down and died And he lay
down and died George Collins rode home one dark stormy night And he lay down and
died.
His sweetheart was at his mother's house A-sewing silk so fine And when she heard
George Collins was dead She lay down her silk and cried She lay down her silk and cried
And when she heard George Collins was dead She lay down her silk and cried.
Oh daughter don't weep, her father said There's other boys than George I know there's
other boys than George But George has won my heart.
Open up the coffin throw back the lid Remove the silk so fine And let me kiss his cold, cold
lips For no, he'll never kiss mine.
I know he'll never kiss mine Oh And let me kiss his pale cold , cold lips For no, he'll never
kiss mine.
She followed him up, she followed him down She followed him to his grave And bending
down on her bendin' knee She weeped she cried she moaned.
