MERRY LITTLE GRAY FAT MAN. 
There is a 
little man, 
Dress'd all in gray, 
He lives in the city, 
A.nd is always gay. 
He's round as an apple, 
And plump as a 
pear 
lie has not a 
shilling, 
Nor has he a 
care. 
And he sings and he laughs, 
And he laughs and he sings, 
Oh, what a 
merry , little, 
Fat, fat, gray man. 
He drinks without counting 
The number of glasses,' 
He sings merry songs 
And he flirts with the lasses. 
He has debts, he has duns, 
But no bailiff he fears, 
He shuts up his doors, 
And lie shuts up his ears. 
— Then he sing-A 
and he laughs, 
And he laughs and he sings, 
Oh. what a 
merry, little, 
Fat, fat, gray man. 
THE WOLF. 
At the peaceful midnight hour, 
Every sense and every power 
Fetter'd lies in downy sleep_ 
Then our careful watch we keep. 
While the wolf in nightly prowl, 
Bays the m000 with hideous howl; 
Gates are barr'd—a vain resistance, 
Females shriek— but no assistance, 
Silence I 
silence h—or you meet your fate— 
Your keys—your jewels—your cash and plate. 
Locks, bolts, and bars soon fly asunder, 
Then to rifle, rob, and plunder.

I DO NOT WATCH ALONE. 
Words and Music by ANNIE FRICKE& 
When ev'ry flow'r that ope'd at morn 
Its weary eye shall close 
And by the wings of meary borne, 
My thoughts on thee repose, 
I 
love to bear the ey'ning bells, 
To list their soothing tone, 
For to my heart their music tells 
I 
do not watch alone, 
I 
do not watch alone. 
In fancy, while I 
hear that chime, 
I 
rove again with thee 
And hear thy vow, " At ev'ning time, 
My ilimerlits of thee shall be." 
Then will I 
love those vesper bells 
And list their soothing tone, 
For to my heart their music tells 
I 
do not watch alone, 
I 
do not watch alone. 
STAND TO YOUR GUNS. 
Stand to your guns, my hearts of oak, 
Let not a 
word on board be spoke, 
Victory soon will crown the joke, 
Be silent and be ready. 
Rain home your guns and spong,e them well, 
Let us be sure the ball , will tell, 
The cannon's roar shall sound their knell, 
Be steady, boys, be steady, 
Not yet— nor .3 
et— nor yet— 
Reserve your fire, I 
do desire—fire I 
Now the elements do rattle, 
The gods amazed, behold the battle ; 
A broadside, my boys. 
See the blood in purple tide, 
Trickle down her battered side ; 
Winged with fate, the bullets fly, 
Conquer, boys, or bravely die, 
Hurl destruction on your foes— 
She sinks—Huzza! 
To the bottom down she goes.

PHILIP THE FALCONER. 
Young Philip the falconer's up with the day, 
With his merlin on his arm, 
And down the mill meadows has taken his way, 
To hawk, and pray where's the harm ? 
Philip is stalwart and PLflp is young, 
And Philip, they say, has a 
musical tongue; 
The miller's young sister is fresh and is fair, 
And Philip is always hawking there. 
He vows and declares, believe it or not, 
There's not in the kingdom for hems such a 
spot. 
And falcons, they say, to fly true to their prey, 
Should be trained in the morning yarly. 
The miller's to market to buy him some corn, 
For work it should ne'er stand still; 
A maiden is loitering under the thorn, 
In the meadow below the mill; 
Aud Philip, grown tired of a 
bachelor's life, 
Thinks the miller's young sister would make a 
good wife 
And so comes a 
whisper, and so comes a 
smile, 
And then a 
long leave-taking over thestile. 
Oh, when he returns (ton market, I 
guess, 
The miller will 'find he's a 
sister the less, 
For maidens, they say do not always say nay, 
When they're asked in the morning early. 
THE WITCHES' GLEE. 
When shall we three meet again 
In thunder, lightning, or in rain ? 
'When the burly burly.s

When the battle's lost or won,

POOR TOIL 
AS I SAT BY MY HEARTH. 
The lirtsi2 of this Song is published by E. H. HARDING, 228 Bowery, 
Price 10 Cents. 
As I 
sat by my hearth, when the daylight was closing, 
Round Time, long departed, was Memory cast; 
The embers burnt low, and were calmly reposing 
Like Age, when the passions of manhood are past. 
In the warm glowing light, I 
could see the loved faces 
Of friends, well remernbeed but long past away, 
And gladly my fond heart rejoiced at the traces, 
That fancy could form of a 
happier day. 
And there was the steeplc its loud music ringing, 
The only glad tune that the poor man can own ; 
The smoke from th, eottag4 was heav'nward winging, 
Like a 
bliss-seeking spirit to sorrow unknown ; 
I 
trac'd too, the roof-tree that ever had shaded 
The porch where the rose and the jasmine would bloom, 
Till my dreams, like the days they recalled to me, faded, 
To vanish forever in darkness and gloom.

A DREAM OF LOVE. 
There is a 
spot where I 
have wandered, 
At morning, noon and silent night, 
And o'er the past and present ponder'd 
And to the future turned my sight. 
There hope wottld tell its tale of pleasure, 
And though the realms of fancy rove, 
While memory yHded up its treasure, 
I 
dreamed a 
waking dream of love, 
A dream of love, 
A waking dream, a 
dream of love. 
That bream of love, tho' years are. flowing. 
Like swiftest river siient by, 
Ne'er
()kite:5 but brighter glowing, 
Comes ever tat,' seems ever nigh, " 
That face 
form divinely tellitt ,, 
Of ldis, sweet gift of heav'n above, 
Like nm,4c's rhartn serenely swelling, 
I 
dr,am, ,,I the waking dream of love. 
TI it dream of love, 
That waktur, dream that dream of 1.o. 
tz's 
•I , 
Then farewell, my trim-built wherry, 
Oars, and coat, and badge farewell; 
Never more at Chelsea ferry, 
Shall your Thomas take a 
spell. 
But to hope and peace a 
stranger, 
In the battle's heat I 
go; 
Where, exposed to every danger, 
Some friendly ball will lay me low. 
Then mayhap, when homeward steering, 
With the news, my messniates come, 
Even you, my story hearing, 
With a 
sigh, way cry, poor Tom. 
WHO DRINKS DEEPLY OP WINE. 
Gaily still my moments roll, 
While I 
quaff the flowing bowl, 
Care can never reach the soul, 
Who deeply drinks of wine. 
See the lover pale with grief, 
Binds his brow with the willow leaf, 
But his soul soon finds relief, 
From deeply drinking wine. 
Eyes of fire, lips of dew, 
Cheeks that shame the rose's hue, 
What are these to me or you, 
Who deeply drinks of wine.

THE SAILOR BOY'S RETURN. 
'Tis five long years since I 
left home, 
The ocean's restless path to roam, 
But. now my native land I 
see, 
The past's a 
dream, ' tis nought to me; 
11Iy father died, my mother wept, 
And would her only child have kept. 
But I 
would not. a 
hurthen be, 
So left my home and went to sea. 
Thou little thinkest, my mother dear, 
Thy roving bov is now so near ; 
My country's cliffs toy eyes delight, 
Yes, Freedom's shores are now in sight. 
E'en as he spoke, a 
fearful gale, 
Sprang up and filled out every sail, 
A 
cry of some one overboard. 
Amidst, the stormy wind is heard ; 
'Tis he, that youth, full of hope. 
Who vainly struggles for the rope. 
- zsz-, 
Ile points his band towards the shore, 
The waves dash on, he's seen no more. 
Where now thy hopes, thy mother's :mile ? 
Departed all, but for a 
while ; 
The past's a 
dream, ' tis nought to thee, 
Now thou art sleeping in the sea. 
THE DASHING WHITE SERGEANT. 
If I 
had a 
beau for a 
soldier would go, 
Do you think I'd say, No ? Oh, no, no 
When his red coat I 
saw, not a 
sigh would it draw, 
But I'd give him eclat for his bravery. 
If an army of Amazons should e'er conic in play, 
As a 
dashing white sergeant I'd march away, 
March away, march away, &-c. 
When my soldier was gone, do you think I'd take on, 
Sit moping, forlorn ?—Oh, no, not I ! 
His fame may concern, how my bosom would burn 
When I 
saw him return crown'd with victory ! 
If an army, & c.

NOW, ISN'T IT A PITY. 
I 
love a 
lad, a 
handsome lad, 
And love him, too, sincerely, 
He played a 
part that won my heart, 
And vowed to love me dearly; 
But aunt's consent she will deny, 
indeed. it's very pretty, 
And I'm so vexed that I 
could cry, 
Now, isn't it a 
pity 
My era-A 
aunt wit jeer and taunt, 
And cry, yourg girls should tarry, 
Because she yet could never get 
A man of mind to marry. 
It's downright spite, you can't deny ; 
Indeed it's very pretty ; 
And you may laugh, but I 
could cry, 
Now, isn't it a 
pity.

THE COAT OF OTHER DAYS. 
Air: " The light of other days." 
The coat of other days is faded, 
And all its beauty's past ; 
My shoes no longer look as they did, 
But, like it, are fading fast; 
When first I 
sported it, a 
new one, 
My uncle's cash, % would raise, 
But now no longer, 'tis a 
new one,— 
The coat of other days. 
The cuffs and collar now are greasy, 
Not a 
bit of nap is there ; 
'T was tight, but now it fits ! tie easy, 
'Twill soon be at rag- fair ; 
My four-and,nioe look rather rummy, 
Exposed to Sol's bright rays, 
And ' tis too late for renovating— 
The coat of other days.

THE MAD BIITCHER.—[CoNoturiED.], 
Nary Jane, you don't know her, but, ha I 
The thoughts of her now makes me start, 
She shone on my path like a 
star, 
But she stolen my pluck and my heart; 
Each day she called into the shop, 
When my heart 'gainst my ribs would go thump; 
When she ask'd me to weigh her a 
chop, 
And some suet, a 
jolly good lump. 
Spoken.— I'd cut her a 
hundred weight of suet and place it by 
tier chops, and think how well we should suit each other, but no, 
she refused me because— 
I'm the mad butcher, ctc. 
She smiled on me one afternoon, 
I 
grew hot and cold by degrees; 
I 
told her my love very soon, 
In the sawdust I 
knelt on my knees; 
But she spurn'd me and then what was mars,

One day I'd a

Spoken.—Yes, and I'm as quiet as a

remain silent, not a

Hurrah ! hurrah ! for the yellow gold, 
Hurrah ! for the sunny land, 
Teeming with treasures still untold 
That wait for the miner's hand ; 
Who'd barter or buy in the busy marts— 
Of the overpeopleil town. 
Plotting and plodding till youth departs 
And in age still breaking down. 
Then merrily ply the pick and spade, 
And rock the cradle fast; 
Here we pursue no idle trade, 
For we may be rich at last.

For ages that none can scan, 
The earth but yields up her wealth again, 
Subdued by her master—Man.

To and fro went his knowing old head, like a

As he chirrupp'd these sentiments out;

SWELLS OF THE OCEAN. 
I 
have been down to Brighton, I 
have dipped in the sea, 
I 
have dived at the waves, and have swam from the shore ; 
And have laugh'd with delight that my limbs they were free,— 
The swell of the ocean to carry me o'er. 
But when I 
return'd to my bathing machine,. 
And have dress'd and emerged on the pebbly strand; 
Oh! that a 
different swell have I 
seen— 
What a 
different swell have I 
grasp'd by the hand 
You may grasp by the hand, boys, 
But keep your hearts f 
co 
From the swells on the shore, 
By the side of the sea. 
There's a 
swell on the shore looking out for a 
bride,— 
For he knows, cunning dog! why the girls are brought down; 
And I'm sorry to say, when he tries the sea- side, 
The mammas are more verdant than they were i 
a 
town. 
He ogles an heiress; ma sanctions the " match," 
And all in a 
season the mischief is done; 
But silly mamma file's, too late, that her " catch" 
Was a 
roue in town, and a 
prodigal son. 
Oh! silly mammas, 
Let your daughters go free 
From the wily embrace 
Of such swells of the sea. 
There's a 
swell on the shore who's down for a 
week, 
And be says, for eleven weeks more he'll remain; 
He has traced to Brighton his pleasure to seek, 
And he's not in a 
hurry to leave it again. 
He's a 
swell who at home was a 
wino-merchant's e:erk, 
With a 
nundred a 
year, -ind spent five pounds a 
day; 
So he went to the Bankruptcy Court " for a 
lark"— 
His " protection " postponed, as he's " out o the way." 
And, instead of a 
prison-yard, 
Here he walks free 
'Mongst the swells on the shore, 
By the side of the sea. 
rim GO AND ENLIST FOR A SAILOR. 
List! oh list! to my sorrowful lay, 
Attention give to my song. I 
pray ; 
And when you've heard it all, you'll say 
That I'm " an unfortunate tailor." 
I 
once was as happy as a 
bird on a 
tree, 
My Sarah was all in the world to me; 
But I'm cut out by a 
son of the sea, 
She has left me here to bewail her. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! why did my Sarah serve me so 
No more will I 
stitch, no more will I 
sew; 
My thimble and my needle to the winds I'll throw, 
And go and enlist for a 
sailor. 
My Sarah was the daughter of a 
publican, 
A gen'rous, kind, good sort of a 
man ; 
Who spoke very plain what he thought of a 
man, 
But he never look'd cross at the tailor. 
My Sarah was as tall as a 
poplar tree, 
As fair as a 
lily, and as brisk as a 
bee; 
And many were the smiles that she smil'd on me, 
Olt ! why am I 
left to bewail her / 
Oh! why did &c. 
My days were happy and my nights the same, 
Till a 
man nani'd Cobb flout the ocean came; 
With a 
big black beard and a 
muskilar frame, 
A captain on board of a 
wh ler. 
He spent his money so frank amid free, 
With his tales of the land and his songs of the sea 
lie stole my Sarah's heart f 
om me, 
And blighted the hopes of the tailor! 
Oh! why did, &c. 
I 
went to plead. but she did refuse, 
She lov'd another so I 
must excuse 
Her candor; but it was no use, 
She never could marry a 
tailor. 
When telling my love, in came that " Cobb," 
Who cried, " Avast there, you lubberly swab ! 
If you don't belay, I'll scuttle your nob." 
And Sarah smiled at the tailor. 
Oh I 
why did, &c. 
Ard so I'll cross the raging sea, 
Since Sarah is untrue to ine ; 
My heart's lock'd up. and she's the key— 
A very unfeeling jailor. 
Farewell, kind friends, a 
last adoo, 
No more my woes shall trouble you: 
The world I'll wander through and through, 
I'll go and enlist for a 
sailor. 
Oh! why did, &C.

TELL PCEVirHAT'S- A MARRIED MAN TO DO. 
I'm the father of a 
family and try to be respectable, 
For life it is a 
trouble to get through, 
And here I 
stand to night, a 
picture so dejectable. 
Tell me what's a 
married man to do. 
Times are so queer, provisions are so dear, 
Money is so tight people say, 
That every man you meet as you walk along the street, 
Says he's lucky if he can but pay his way. 
Tell me what's a 
married man to do? 
I've heard 'twas contemptible to fly into a 
passion, . 
But what I'm telling you to night is true. 
I've daughters grown up, and they will dress in the fashion, 
Tell me what's a 
married man to do. 
True the dresses now are neat yet they're used to sweep the street 
And do the work that scavengers should do, 
And the bills we have to pay to the milliners every day, 
Is enough to make a 
parent look quite blue. 
Tell me what's a 
married man to do. 
We lately had reports of the doings of the Fenians, 
Putting quiet people in a 
stew. 
And abroad there is a 
row with the French and the Prussians, 
Tell me what's a 
married man to do. 
Befurmers they may prate about the dreadful state 
Of things in this land of liberty, 
With five cents on our backs, they've levied on the revenue tax. 
Where the money is to come from puzzles me. 
Tell me what's a 
married man to do. 
But seventy has gone and I'm sure you will not doubt me, 
in wishing a 
much better year to you, 
Than the one which has pai•sed, for When I 
10 ,,I; about me, 
I 
think what's a 
married man to do. 
And still we need not fear but what the coming year, 
Will prove better than the one that has passed, 
And we'll join both heart and hand, like brothers in one band, 
To live in peace and quietude at last. 
That's dial, all We married men skould do. 
CHEER FOR THE PILOTS. 
The sturdy Pilots put to sea, 
Over the waves went they ; 
For a 
ship's dim form, in the rising storm 
Came on her trackless way. 
They saw afar each tap'ring spar 
Of a 
ship, whose trembling sails 
Too fragile were for the tempest there, 
And rent by the storm's rude gales. 
Then cheer for the Pilots, whoever you be, 
Who have anxiously wateled for a 
friend on the sea I 
The storm rag'd high, and the rocks were nigh, 
But :the Pilots' barque was driven 
Far, far, aback from the vessel's track. 
Which they to reach had striven. 
And darkness came save when the flame 
Of the vivid lightning threw 
A light that bore, to their friends on shore, 
The ship—but no Pilots' crew. 
Then cheer for the Pilots, whoever you be, 
Who have anxiously watch'd for a 
friend on the sea! 
The storm was o'er, and a 
calm once m• re, 
Was over the sea and sky : 
Ti e 
ship, with the tide, in the harbor glide, 
But no Pilots' barque was nigh I 
A mariner's form ' mid the wrecks of the storm, 
Was seen on the ebbing wave. 
Its pulse was cold, and a 
tale it told, 
That the deep was the Pihtta' grave.

THE BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS, 
Hail to the hero, the pride of his country, 
Honor'd by all be his ever great name, 
Where is the tnan who presumes with effrontery 
To tarnish the laurels that bloom with his fame ; 
Down where the waters flow, 
lie met the invading foe, 
Where great Mississippi resounds with his fame. 
There, with his gallant, baud, 
Nobly sustained the land, 
And cover'd the foe with confusion and shame. 
'Loudly the thunders of battle were roaring, 
Hurling defeat in the ranks of the foe, 
Proudly above the proud eagle was soaring, 
The warriors of Britain were prostrate and low; 
There with undaunted mein, 
Jackson shone amid the scene; 
The red glare of battle, the hero display'd, 
lie every bosom fired, 
His voice, every one inspired, 
To conquest, to glory, they rush'd undismayed. 
Mid volumes of smoke, that the combat enshrouded, 
Thy banner, 0 
Freedom ! with brilliancy shone, 
But, Britain, the sum of thy glory was clouded, 
Thy legions were routed, thy host overthrown; 
No more along the coast, 
Is heard their haughty boast, 
While beauty and booty the battle impel, 
Long they'll lament the day, 
When in the mortal fray, 
Their hopes were all crush'd with the thousands who fell. 
Hail, thou firm patriot, beloved by the nation, 
Thy honor unsoird, by integrity tried, 
Worthy to fill the most exalted station, 
With valor to save, and with skill to preside. 
In vain the intriguing foe 
Aims the insidious blow, 
To blight thy fair laurels, to sully thy fame, 
Truth, with the rays of light. 
Thy virtues, brave chief, will write, 
In the annals of greatuel,s emblazon thy name.

THE WATER PARTY.—[CONCLUDED.] 
At eight o'clock we hired a 
boat, 
Our hampers, in we stows 'em, 
And very soon we were afloat, 
On Father Thames's bosom; 
At Putney Bridge, young Snooks turned pale, 
And gave a 
reglar start, he 
Vowed he had just seen a 
whale, 
Which frightened all the party.—Cuoaus. 
But very soon we understood, 
As true as I'm a 
liver, 
It wan't a 
whale, but logs of wood, 
A-floating down the river; 
Brown 'stead of rowing, was intent 
On the charms of Miss McCarthy, 
He " caught a 
crab," and over went 
To the anguish of the party !—OnontTS. 
He floundered like a 
fish about, 
We did our best to aid him, 
Until at last we got him out, 
And in the boat we laid him; 
As he was damp, it damped our luck, 
When stupid Teddy Smart, he 
Steered in the mud, and there we stuck, 
Which did disgust the party.—Cnouna 
How we ourselves could extricate, 
We'd no means of discerning, 
We'd nothing else to do,- but wait 
Until the tide was turning; 
At ten at night, we got off right, 
Expressed our thanks so hearty, 
And homeward rowed, with all our might., 
To end the water party.—CnOnuS. 
At Putney Bridge, we net a 
shock, 
And greatly it surprised us, 
The bridge against our boat did knock, 
And smash'd it, and capsized us! 
We were fished out, while folks did shout, 
And laughed at us so hearty, 
'Twill do me good when I 
go out 
Again with the water party.--CuORnS,

TRY AGAIN. 
THE HEN CONVENTION. 
When there's business to be done 
By which fortune may be won, 
It should quickly be begun, 
No delay 1 
For old time hath eager eyes; 
And each moment, as it flies, 
Oft may bear the wished-for prize 
Far away. 
When there's work for us to do, 
Which we think we can't get through, 
And fearing to pursue, 
Say, ' tis vain. 
Oh I 
then, let us persevere, 
And though hard the task appear, 
Onward bra,ely, without fear, 
Try again. 
Yes I 
though fate your efforts foil, 
And the gold for which we toil, 
May be hid beneath the soil, 
Out of sight; 
Yet, if courage clear the way, 
Hope will lend a 
cheering ray, 
And will shed the light of day 
Thro' the night. 
Then, whatever be your aim, 
Be it power, wealth, or fame, 
That from fortini you would claim, 
Never mind; 
We have all our work to do: 
If we keep the end in view, 
Success rewards the true, 
We shall find.

But Mr. Rooster Shanghai

Hen-hearted, with no soul. " 
Says Shanghai, " Your poor Bantams 
Are a 
race of chicken toys," 
Bays Bantam, " If you peek at me, 
You'll find I'm one of the boys." 
It was cackle, (to. 
A poultry duel came on straight— 
'Twas Bantam and Shanghai ; 
A crow at first, and then a

And Shanghai shanged the lowest

PRETTY LITTLE HOOP SKIRT MAKER. 
I've fallen in love with a 
pretty young girl, 
My wife I 
think I'll make her, 
I 
met her first on Baltimore street, 
She's a 
pretty little hoop skirt maker, 
Such charming feet, for I 
watched her heels, 
As I 
came up behind her, 
There may be a 
fairer in the land, 
But I 
don't know where to find her. 
CHORUS, 
For she's just about the age and all the rage, 
Is my Matilda Baker, 
She looks so fair, with her yellow, curly hair, 
She's a 
pretty little hoop skirt maker. 
I 
introduced myself as soon, 
As I 
could overtake her, 
By saying, " will you my umbrella share," 
To her home I 
said I'd take her, 
Yes certainly, she spoke so nice, 
And chatted on so gaily; 
Oh I 
don't I 
love that handsome girl, 
And so, I 
meet her daily. 
For she's, &c. 
To the dancing rooms about the town, 
On Saturday nights I'd take her, 
There's not another pair can cut and shuffle there, 
Like me and Matilda Baker, 
Sometimes we to the theatre go, 
And don't she look so fine oh 
And as soon as I've saved cash enough, 
I 
mean to make her mine oh I

For she's, dr.c.

ANY CHAIRS TO MEND. 
Kind friends, deceiv'd I 
have basely been 
Thro' a 
girl who like a 
bird could sing, 
And by her I 
have slighted been, 
All through another chap. 
When first we met, 'twas in the Strand, 
List'ning to the Tin-pot band, 
An old chair on her arm—she look'd so grand— 
I 
fell deeply in love with her. 
” 
Any chairs to mend ? any chairs to mend?" 
As along the street her way she'd wend— 
" 
Any chairs to mend? any chairs to mend ?" was her cry. 
How she deceived me I 
will tell— 
My heart the size of a 
cabbage did swell; 
Yet, spite of this, I 
was compelled 
To see her wed another. 
As round the street she'd wend her way, 
Crying " Any chairs to mend to-day ?" 
Canes under her arm—she look'd so gay— 
I 
thought her quite the thing. 
Any chairs, dr.c. 
On Sunday, dress'd so smart and gay, 
We down to Greenwich would spend the day , 
Ninepence a-head for tea I'd pay, 
And for her pick the shrimps.

ANY CHAIRS TO MEND. [CONCLUDED. 
Then after tea we had some fun— 
She'd down the hill with others run ; 
And by one of them I 
was outdone— 
His name was Count Fiasco. 
Any chairs, &T. 
This chap told her such lots of lies: 
With winning ways he did contrive 
To gain her young affection and, thrive 
On the fibs he had told. 
A Count, he said, he'd be one day; 
And thus he led her quite astray, 
I 
never saw her from that day 
We first went out to tea. 
Any chairs, drc, 
Last Sunday week they married were 
Things went all right, and tight, and square, 
Till he ran and left her in despair 
To go her daily rounds. 
New, all young men, a 
warning take 
From this my very sad mistake : 
If you do not wish to share my fate, 
Don't fall in love with girls who cry— 
Any chairs, Ltc.

LOVE AND PRIDE. 
COMIC MEDLEY DUET. 
Written by HARRY CLIFTON. 
Tillie. 
And so, Miss, you mean to deceive me,— 
Your promises all would you break ? 
Do you think it is kind thus to grieve me, 
When you know I 
would die for your sake ? 
I 
don't ask you to live upon pottage, 
Or anything mean, 'pon my word. 
Jenny. 
The idea of love in a 
cottage 
is decidedly very absurd. 
Willie. 
There's some soldiers away in the village close by,— 
I'll go and enlist, in the wars I 
will die 
Like a 
warrior bold ; and the story you'll bear 
That your William he died like a 
brave cavalier. 
So make up your mind. Miss, as soon as yen can, 
And take me for better or worse. " IM 
the man" 
To render you happy as happy can be; 
If not, to the wars I'll go over the sea. 
Jenny. 
Don't talk of marriage, unless in a 
carriage 
To church you can take me, and make me your wife. 
You have not a 
shilling—of course I'm not willing. 
Willie. 
Then wretched I'll be all the days of my life. 
My sorrows I'll bury, become military, 
Enlist for a 
soldier, and off to the wars. 
Jenny. 
Make haste, be going, your valor be showing, 
But you'll never do so. 
Willie. 
Why not ? 
[I] 
LOVE AND PRIDE. [CONCLUDED. 
Jenny. 
Because 
You must march, march—come right about—face this way. 
Willie. 
Yes, march, march, for one-and-a-penny a 
day 
Jenny. 
March, march, come right about—face this way. 
Alter your pace—right about face—off, off, and away. 
Good-bye, Jenny dear, I'm off now in a 
crack, 
I'll go and be a 
warrior—you'll never see me back. 
This is the last time you'll gaze upon your Bill, 
I 
go to fight against the foe and fight against my will. 
Jenny. 
Don't be so provoking—I 
was only joking. 
Then it's very cruel, for with grief I'm nearly choking. 
You mean to wed with me, then—how happy I 
shall be, then ! 
I'll never be a 
soldier, if you'll marry me. 
Oh, I'll stay at home, I 
never will roam. 
Jenny. 
'Twould be very wrong if you do so. 
Willie. 
might stick on an island, and never see dry land, 
Like a 
second young Robinson Crusoe. 
Jenny. 
Never mind Robinson Crusoe. 
No, because I 
love you so. 
You shall be my man Friday, and keep my house tidy.

THE CURLY LITTLE BOW WOW. 
Miss Biggs was an old maid, 
So stately and so staid, 
And her house in Portman Square, 
Was crowded with nick-nacks, 
And china all in cracks, 
With articles of vertu rare; 
She'd a 
parrot gray, call'd 
That could whistle " Nix my Dolly ;" 
But the pride of her life, I 
vow, 
Was a 
pretty little poodle, 
Of the name of Shanky Doodle, 
Which she used to call her bow, wow, wow, 
CHORUS. 
For a 
jolly girl was she, 
So easy and so free, 
With her curly .little bow, wow, wow. 
Great pains Miss B, would take 
Her little pet to make 
In health and strength quite sound; 
To keep its coat like silk, 
It was fed on bread and milk, 
And when Saturday morn came round 
She'd put it in a 
tub, 
And its coat begin to scrub; 
Then she'd towel it dry with care, 
And take air and exercise, 
With her pretty little prize, 
In the neighborhood of Mayfair. 
For a 
jolly, tte... 
But her poodle long had pined 
Its liberty to find, 
As though of all sense bereft, 
She, with no one near to warn her, 
One day darted r‘gled the corner,

CURLY LITTLE BOW WOW. 
Miss B., when told the news, 
Was afflicted with the blues, 
And grew nervous over tea, 
And was very nearly cranky 
At the thought of losing Shanky, 
Who she never more thought to see.

For a

Now, not far from Portman Square, 
There resided, I 
declare, 
An old Major of the name of Boodle. 
One evening after dark, 
While walking in Hyde Park, 
He met a 
distracted poodle. 
He was smitten with its charms, 
So he took it in his arms; 
While his bachelor days to end, 
He said, when he was shown her, 
That he'd wed the lucky owner 
Of his curly little canine friend. 
For a 
jolly, dm. 
The owner he found out, 
From the hand bills round about. 
The Major off did start, 
With the poodle in a 
string, 
'Saw the maiden Biggs--poor thing l— 
And offered her his hand and heart. 
Upon his knees he went, 
And, asking her consent, 
Said a 
happy man was he; 
While stroking like a 
noodle 
That pretty little poodle, 
She promised that his wife she'd be.

GLASS—WITEC GARR. 
Some little time ago, I 
did to Margate go,. 
By a 
very cheap- third-class- excursion train 
There was such an awful rush, and an overwhelming crusb„ 
That I 
vow'd I'd never travel so again. 
For an hour I 
had to wait, pushid up against a 
crate-, 
And I 
leant against it faint, for want of au', 
When, in letters large and black, there came off tmon. m7.4-
back 
A 
label that was printed.
, " Glass—with care.' 
Oh I 
I 
never shall forget what. a 
quizzing I 
did get. 
On the day that I 
was IthelVd, " Glass—wilh care' 
At length, annoy'd and & sled, into my place I

And found a 
third-class carriage not a 
joke ; 
Twuct a 
sweep, not over clean, and a 
boy ahar.t loucteert, 
I 
was smother'a by their bad tobacco smoke. 
But the train went pretty fast, and we arriv -d. at Iast, 
But, of the fact I 
still was unaware,. 
That a 
label on my back antiounc'd in letters blacli. 
"Keep this side up," and " Fragile—Glass— with care,," 
Clit ! I 
never.. 
Arrived. on the Parade, an excitement quite I 
made— 
I 
was mobb'd by a 
crowd I 
scarce could pass; 
And the little boys all cried, as they round me hied,.

PERCY ST. BARBE, OF THE HORSE GUARDS, 
BLUE. 
Percy St. Barbe, of the Horse Guards, Blue, 
Was very good-looking, and six foot two; 
No end of a 
swell with charming manners, 
And a 
penchant for claret and Benson's Havanas; 
He was very hard up, though, for since he left school, 
lie had never been able to pay Mr. Poole; 
And his thousand a-year went a 
very short way, 
With a 
thorough-bred team and some losses at play, 
With a 
thorough, eza.:, 
Now the Lady Carew° gave a 
very grand ball, 
To bring out her daughter, so stately and tall— 
The beauteous Georgiana, as fair as the Mignon, 
But with long yellow hair and a 
marvellous chignon. 
Ali I 
when Percy beheld this dear angel in gauze, 
His heart beat the double, then came to a 
pause; 
So he trilled out his love in a 
sweet tenor solo, 
'Georgina Divina-ah I 
come t'acloro l" 
Georgina Divina-all! tEc. 
Georgina's papa would not hear of his snit; 
Shook his fist at poor Percy, and swore like a 
brute. 
"'Tis money* I 
want, and Pm sure so do you; 
As for blood, I'm descended from Brian Born I 
PERCY T. 
BARBE. CON C 
My daughter will wed Mr. Alderman Lowndes, 
With his place in North Hants, and his million of pounds; 
But you are the very last man I 
should ohoos'e. 
With these dreadful accounts of you men in the 'Blues." 
With these, dzc. 
Percy stroked his moustache, and said, " This won't do-a 
For a 
man who belongs to the Horse-a 
Guards Blue-a 
So at night he performed a 
small escalade, 
And tenderly warbled this serenade: 
4` 
Georgiana, !ilia! I 
pray thee hear, 
And swift appear, mine eyes to cheer,— 
The stars have hid their light, love, 
While here I 
wait for thee; 
Shed joy upon my sight, love, 
And fly the world with me." 
Georgina soon conquer'd her fears and alarms, 
And softly descending, was clasp'd in his arms; 
But while promenading about in the grounds, 
They ran up against Mr. Alderman Lowndes. 
Now this gentleman prov'd a 
good friend at the last, 
For lie made her papa forget all that had pass'd; 
And a 
month after that Georgiana Carewe 
Married Percy St. Barbe of the Horse Guards, Blue.

MAN WITH THE WOODEN LEG. 
Air.—" Gal in Blue," 
When I 
was twenty years of age, in love I 
deep did fall, 
With a 
gal from Pennsylvania, it was at a 
fancy ball. 
Her glances pierce through and through me, her name was 
Annie Searles, 
Her eyes were blue, and oh, she had such lovely auburn curls. 
CHORUS. 
But oh, she was unkind to me, I 
would not care a 
peg, 
She ran away to Philadelphia, with a 
man with a 
wooden leg. 
[Repeat 
The day I 
asked Annie dear if those lovely curls were dyed. 
With passion she slapped my face, and boxed my ears besides. 
I 
nearly fell upon the floor, alas poor Annie Searles, 
1 
made a 
grab, and in my hand, I 
found those lovely auburn 
curls. 
But oh, she was, etc 
Now I'm down on young girls, no matter when or where, 
I

Her lips so red can vie, 'tis said, 
With Covent Garden roses, 
While, out beneath, her pearly teeth 
Their snowy white discloses I 
To see her smile, I'd walk a 
mile, 
She's, in her chin, a 
dimple ; 
Upon her nose a 
large wart grows, 
And, on her cheek, a 
pimple. 
With a

Then she can sing like anything, 
No voice I'm sure is finer, 
She's such a 
throat, her highest note 
Is P

To hear her play, and sing" Dog Tray," 
I'm sure ' tis worth a

For no trombone excels in tone 
The voice of Juliana.

THE STAMP Aar 
Sind friends all just list to me, 
A song I'm going to sing to you, 
And if you will attention pay, 
The truth I'll try and bring to you. 
It's of an act that's all the rage 
In this part of creation; 
For they put a 
stamp on everything 
You get in this great nation. 
CHORUS. 
Oh. yes indeed, 'tis so, 
The stamp act now is all the rage, 
And that you all do know. 
There's stamps on drugs and groceries, 
On tin parrs, pots and kettles; 
On jewelry and crockery- ware, 
And even on our victuals. 
There's stamps on hardware too, as well 
As door-knobs, butts and latches, 
And they even put a 
penny stamp 
On every box of matches. 
Oh. yes indeed, 'tis so, 
The stamp act now is all the rage, 
And that you all do know. 
There's stamps on Equors and cigars, 
And things that make life happy : 
Your children, too, must all be stamped 
E'er they can call you pappy. 
There's stamps upon your cake and pie ; 
Upon pitchers, pen and bo‘Nl, 
And if a 
man should chance to die, 
They'd want to stamp his soul, sir. 
Oh, ves inJ.ced, jtc 
NEVER LOSE YOUR GRIP. 
New bye words now are all the go as thfough the streets you 
trip, 
The latest one that has come out, is never lose your grip. 
How strange it is, but yet its true, no matter what you're doing, 
When once a 
man lets go his hold, he is sure to go to ruin. 
Some years ago, when we were young, John Bull he thought 
he'd come it, 
By sending tea unto our land and putting taxes on it, 
lie soon found out it would not pay, we never let it slip, 
We threw it overboard, and that's where Johnny lost his grip. 
There is one thing more I've got to say, and soon you will see, 
We've got to help the Fenian boys to set old Ireland free, 
And then we will tackle on to Spain and make her git up and 
git 
And give the Cuban boys a 
chance to once more hold their grip. 
Our country produced a 
host of men whose conduct was a 
shame, 
Some who done their duty well and won a 
glorious name, 
(hikers had it in their hands, they let their chances slip, 
Those that served their country well, never lost their grip.

BLUE EYED ROSA. 
Serenade. 
A blonde I 
met the other day, 
With long and flowing hair; 
But who she is I 
cannot say, 
But I 
meet her everywhere. 
She's got a 
corner of my heart, 
I 
see her in my dreams; 
She's too angelic to be mortal, 
A spirit to me she seems. 
CHORUS. 
They call her blue eyed Rosa, 
Her name I'll ne'er forget; 
Her blush is like a 
rose in May, 
I'll try and win her yet. 
She smiles at me when we do meet. 
On every thorou0dare, 
Those sweet blue eyes of Rosa dears 
Do haunt me everywhere. 
1 
met her the other afternoon, 
Out for a 
promenade; 
I 
stopped and introduced myself, 
And pretty things I 
said. 
She said I 
might escort her home, 
It made me feel so queer; 
I 
shall never forget the day I 
met, 
My p 
etty Rosa dear. 
T; ey call her, trzc. 
I 
walked along with Rosa dear, 
The time did quickly pass ; 
I 
asked her if she would be mine, 
Her mamma she would ask; 
I 
waited for my answer, 
The words my heart did eLeer: 
For now I'm married and settled down, 
Along with floss dear,

GAL BY THE NAME OF BleGEE. 
I'll sing of a 
damsel so lovely and fair,. 
With her in beauty na gal could compare; 
Such lovely e3, es and sweet curly hair, 
Had this gal by the name of McGee. 
Her pa and her ma were both mighty rich, 
They lived up on avenue V.; 
The sports round the city were all deep in love, 
With this gal by the name of McGee. 
CHORUS. 
She cared not for them, but in spite of their moans, 
She cast them aside for a 
fellow named Jones ; 
He sat on the end and he'd rattle the bones, 
In a 
nigger band down on Broadway. 
To see him perform every night she would go, 
The seat she would take was in the front row, 
Sweet scented bouquets to him she would throw 
To let her lover know she was there. 
In rapture she smiled on his comical songs, 
0! my, what a 
sight it was to see; 
And loud she laughed at his stale, played out, jokes, 
Would this gal by the name of McGee. 
She cared not for them, ei.c. 
To see her papa and get his consent. 
The pair of them to her house straightway went; 
To marry her love she fully was bent, 
No matter what others might say. 
The old man he kicked up a 
horrible row, 
It was something that he could not see; 
lie ran Mn. JONES for his life from the house, 
And locked up poor Susie McGee. 
She cared not for them, & c. 
To all her entreati , s 
the old man was deaf, 
So Susie, quite strick , u 
with sorrow and grief, 
Resolved that in death she'd soon find relief, 
And end all her woes here on earth. 
That nightafter writing a 
letter quite long, 
To the loved one she'd never More see; 
She swallowed her waterfall, hair pins and all, 
And that is what became of McGee. 
She cared not for them, etc. 
WHERE FLOWER:1 BLUSH AND BLOOM. 
Words and Music by Wm. H. 
DELEHANTY. 
I 
took a 
walk in Spring time 
To while away the hours, 
And chanced to see a 
maiden, 
A sprinkling budding flowers; 
In a 
handsome little garden, 
Around a 
cottage home, 
Where Cupid's ever lurking, 
And flowers blush and bloom. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, she's the fairest of the fair, 
Like a 
jewel rich and rare; 
I 
saw her in the garden, 
Mid roses' sweet perfume, 
And felt the dart of Cupid 
Where flowers blush and bloom. 
I 
often pass the cottage, 
In hopes that I 
may see 
This charming little creature, 
The dearest one to me. 
For I 
feel that I 
have won her, 
And hope the day will come 
That makes her mine forever, 
Where flowers blush and bloom. 
Oh, she's the fairest, & e. 
Oh, yes, I'm very happy, 
I'll meet my love to- night, 
And that's the very reason 
I'm dancing with delight. 
Fate doomed her as my partner, 
And that shall be quite soon, 
We'll know no care nor sorrow, 
Where flowers blush and bloom. 
Oh, she's the fairest, 
" 
JOGGiNG THROUGH LIFE." 
Am:—" Lip in a 
Balloon." 
Thro' life we go jogging and never say die, 
Live like a major and make money fly. 
To balls and nice parties we frequently go, 
Drive out fast horses, and never go slow. 
Buy Policy numbers, the tiger we fight, 
Go heavy in stocks and come away light, 
Drink fusil oil plenty, get drunk as a 
loon, 
And that's the way to send yourself--
CHORUS. 
Up in a 
balloon, boys, up in a 
balloon, 
All around the little stars, sailing ' round the moon, 
Up in a 
balloon, boys, up in a 
balloon, 
All around the little stars, sailing 'round the moon, 
In Cuba the people for freedom will dare, 
The sword and the flames o'er the battle-fields glare, 
Not under the yoke of Spain will they toil, 
But clasp hands with each other on freedom's proud soil. 
I 
hope that successful they quickly will be, 
Their cause is just when they want to be free, 
And if we recognize them, why that would be soon, 
And send their oppressors flying— 
Up in a 
balloon, ctTc. 
Now Reverdy Johnson to England did go 
To hasten them up, he thought they were slow, 
When he got there they treated him sweet, 
So the best thing he done was to go out and eat. 
Of talk we've had plenty, and show without name, 
We'd better ask England what's her little game. 
If she don't settle the Alabama claims soon, 
We'll show them how jobs are done— 
Up in a 
balloon, & c.

THE BATTLE OF BALTEMEOBE. 
Ord Ross, Cockburn, and Cochran too, 
And many a 
bloody villain more, 
Swore with their bloody savage crew, 
That they would pinnder Baltitnore. 
But General Winder being afraid 
That his militia would not stand, 
He sent away to crave the aid 
or a 
few true Virginians. 
Then up we rose with hearts elate, 
To help our suffering sister state. (te. 
When first our orders we received, 
For to prepare without delay, 
Our wives and sweethearts for to leave. 
And to the army march away. 
Although it grimed our hearts full sore, 
To leave our sweet Virginia shore, 
We kissed our sweethearts o'er and o'er, 
And marched like true Virginians. 
Adieu awhile, sweet girls, adieu, 
With honor we'll return to you. &o. 
With rapid marches on we went, 
To leave our sweet Virginia shore, 
No halt was made, no time was spent, 
Till we arrived at Baltimore. 
The Balthnoreans did us greet, 
The ladies clapt their lily-white bands 
Exclaiming as we passed the street, 
Welcome ye brave Virginians. 
May heaven all your foes confound, 
And send you home with laurels crown'd. Ste 
We had not been in quarters long, 
Before we heard the dread alarms. 
The cannon roared, the bells did ring, 
The drum did beat to arms, to arms. 
Then up we rose to face our foes, 
Determined to meet them on the strand, 
And drive them back from freedom's shore, 
Or die like brave Virginians. 
In heaven above we placed our trust. 
Well knowing thnt our cause was just. cte. 
THE BATTLE OF BALTTIKORE. 
[CONCLUDED.1 
Then Ross be landed at North Point, 
With seven thousand men or more, 
And Swore by that time next night, 
That lie would be in Baltimore. 
But Striker met him on the strand, 
Attended by a 
chosen band, 
Where he received a 
fatal shot, 
From a 
brave Pennsylvanian— 
Whom heaven directed to the field. 
To make this haughty Briton yield, & c. 
Then Coclzburn he drew up his fleet, 
To bombard Fort McHenry, 
A thinking that our men, of course, 
Would take alright and run away. 
The fort was commanded by a 
patriot band, 
As ever graed fair freedom's land, 
As he who did the fort command, 
Was a 
true blue Virginian. 
Long may we have brave Arrnstead's name 
Recorded on the book of fame, die. 
A day and a 
night they tried their might, 
But found their bombs did not prevail, 
And seeing their army put to flight, 
They weighed anchor and made sail. 
Resolving to return again, 
To execute their former plan; 
But if they do they'll find us still, 
That we are brave Virginians. 
And they shall know before they've done, 
That they are not in Washington. 
But now their shipping's out of sight, 
And each man takes a 
parting glass, 
Drink to his true love and heart's delights 
His only joy and bosom friend, 
For I 
mie-ht as well drink a 
health, 
For I 
hate to see good liquor stand, 
That America may always boast, 
That we are brave Virginians. die.

THE CANDY SHOP. 
Oh, don't I 
love a 
pretty gal, 
Her name is Nelly Darning Cotton, 
Oh, don't she look so gorgeous. 
When all her Sunday best she's got on. 
Nelly wears a 
lovely dress, 
With follerrolls around the bottom, 
The first time I 
saw Nelly, 
By Cupid I 
was struck. 
CIJOR US. 
Oh, my, she keeps a 
little candy shop, 
Oh, dear, I 
reckon I'm in luck, 
My eyes Ishe's sweeter than a 
sugar plum, 
I'm so fond of Nelly, for she's such a 
little duck. 
When first I 
met Miss Darning Cotton, 
I 
in Broadway was stalking, 
Looking at the bonnet shops. 
I 
saw my pretty Nelly walking. 
I 
smiled at her, she smiled at me, 
Then we began a 
talking, 
She was so fascinating, 
Quite stupid I 
was struck. 
Oh, my, she keeps, 'Ix. 
She is so fair I 
do declare 
My love for her I 
could not smother, 
I 
told her so and then she said, 
She'd introduce me to her mother. 
How I 
jumped for joy, 
When she said ,she didn't love another, 
I 
thought I 
should have fainted, 
She was such a 
little duck. 
Oh, my, she keeps, (Lc. 
FISHERMAN'S GIRL. 
It was down in the country, a 
poor girl was weeping, 
It was down in the country, poor Mary Ann did mourn; 
She belongs to this nation, I 
have lost each dear relation, 
Cries a 
poor little fisherman's girl—my friends are dead and gone. 
Oh, who has a 
soft heart to give me some shelter, 
For the bitter winds do blow, and dreadful is the storm, 
I 
have no father nor mother, but I've a 
tender brother, 
Cries a 
poor little fisherman's girl—my friends aro dead and gone. 
Oh, once I'd enjoyment, my friends they reared me tender, 
I 
pass'd with my brother each happy night and morn; 
But death has made a 
slaughter, poor father's in the water, 
Cries a 
poor little fisherman's girl—my friends are dead and gone. 
So fast falls the snow, and I 
cannot find shelter, 
So fast falls the snow, and I 
must hasten to the thorn, 
For my covering is the bushes, ray bed is the rushes, 
Cried the poor little fisherman's girl—my 
friends are dead and gone. 
It happened as she passed by a 
very noble cottage, 
A gentleman, he heard her, his breast for her did burn; 
Crying, come in poor lonely creature ! he viewed each drooping feature 
Of a 
poor little fisherman's girl— whose friends are dead and gone. 
He took her to the tire, and when he'd warm'd and fed her, 
The tears began to fall, be fell on her breast forlorn ; 
Crying, live with me forever, we part again, no, never, 
You are my dearest sister! our friends are dead and gone. 
So now she's got a 
home, she's living with her brother, 
So now she's got a 
home, and the needy ne'er does scorn ; 
For God was her protector, likewise her kind conductor, 
The poor little fisherman's girl— when her friends were dead and gene.

As most works of the kind were either too verbose, or too trite, tame and 
r. 
Inelegant. 
This book hits the happy medium of just suiting the present 
time, and it furnishes examples of every style worthy of imitation, or of being 
copied. 
It is fast superseding all the antiquated Letter-Writers that have 
long outlived their usefulness. 
So great is the sale of this excellent book that 
it may truly be said that since its publication, 
" 
Those write now who never wrote before, 
And those who always wrote, now write the more."
