"TAKE CARE ." 
B Y JOHN M CVEIGH. 
De debble am a 
liar and a 
conjurer, too; 
Take care, don't you come a-nigh; 
If you ain't mighty careful I 
spect he'll conjure 
you— 
Take care, don't you come a-nigh. 
When you hear de little angels, dar's no use to 
weep; 
Take care, don't you come a-nigh; 
For in de arms of Abram dis nigger's gwine to 
sleep— 
Take care, don't you come a-nigh. 
Chorus—Den it's take care, don't you come 
a- nigh me, child ; 
Go way, don't you come a- nigh; 
Take care, don't you come a-nigh me, 
child, 
I'se gwine to get to glory by-and-by. 
As I 
went to de woods, now what you spec I 
see? 
Take care, don't you come a- nigh ; 
De debble wid his cloven foot was gazin' on to 
me— 
• Take care, don't you eome 
Says the debble to me, - Say, how do you do?" 
Take care, don't you come a-nigh ; 
Says I, " Mr. Debbie, I've got nutlin' to do wid 
you "— 
Take care, don't you come a- nigh. 
Chorus— Den it's take care, etc. 
A 
nigger on a 
hossback thought he was a 
king— 
Take care, don't you come a-nigh; 
Along come an alligator and took de nigger in— 
Take care, don't you come a-nigh. 
De wenches in de neighborhood dey all begin 
to holler, 
Take care, don't you come a- nigh ; 
But he eat de nigger up, all icept a 
paper collar— 
Take care, don't you come a-nigh. 
Chorus—Den it's take care, etc.

THE OLD DARKY'S LAMENT. 
By JEAN E. 
FORRESTAL. 
De ole man will putty soon be gone; 
Yes, gone to dat Ian' ob de blest, 
Whar de angels will sing him to sleep, 
An' his poor, tired soul be at rest. 
Dis poor ole hulk am weary an' forlorn ; 
Dese eyes dey were sightless long ago; 
My many troubles orn make me weep, 
An' wish dat I 
could leab (Us 'arth below. 
Many years ago, way down in ole Kaintuek, 
I 
had wife an' churn bore to comfort me; 
But now dey hab all gone up above, 
An' Pse ler here all alone, as you kin see. 
Dose days I 
seemed to hab de bes' oh luck, 
For ole mass he war kind, an' missy too; 
Dc y 
war so fond oh us an' full ob love, 
But now dey's gone, an' I'll bid you 
adieu. 
THE FREE TICKET. 
By EMAC CROOK. 
A pious man was Jonathan Snow, 
The man who never had been to a 
show; 
A Christian man who said his prayers, 
And sowed his seed where sinful tares 
Could choke it not. 
Sedate and calm, 
He loved good eider, a 
sermon or psalm, 
And lived a 
life that was free from blame, 
As pure and spotless as his name. 
Now, of all the things that Jonathan did— 
And never under a 
bushel he hid 
The candle of virtue that burned in his breast— 
Of all good things, I 
repeat, the best, 
A 
ecording to Jonathan's notion, was, 
That he never had been to a 
show, " Because," 
As he frequently said, "a 
show is a 
place 
Where the devil himself is put to disgrace!" 
4 
It happened that once a 
circus came 
t110 the village where Jonathan dwelt, and the 
same 
Was known as the Mighty Miraculous 
Egyptian Menagerie mind Circus; 
And wonderful were the things, J 
ween, 
That on the flaring bills were seen ; 
Lions and tigers and monsters immense— 
And the price of admission was fifty cents. 
On the very day that the show arrived, 
And the boys about the canvas hived, 
Jonathan Snow in the grocery store 
Discoursed as he never discoursed before 
On the sinfulness of the circus- es, 
Which are run by Satan, he said, to please 
The wicked of earth, and lead them in 
To the ways of darkness, death and sin. 
" 
Fur it stands to reason," said Jonathan Snow, 
That them as finds delight in a 
show 
Must be of a 
low and vulgar kind, 
Without any piety into their mind, 
But full of the sins of the flesh ; and, for me. 
I 
would sooner jump into the bottomless sea 
Than go to this Mighty Miraculous 
Egyptian Menagerie and Circus!" 
While Jonathan thus was moved to deplore, 
It chanced that a 
stranger came into the store— 
A quiet, respectable- looking chap, and he 
Belonged to the M. E. M. and C. 
, He heard what Jonathan had to say, 
Then smiled in a 
sort of peculiar way, 
And, drawing nearer, he said to Snow, 
"My friend, here's a 
ticket to go to the show!" 
In mute astonishment Jonathan scanned 
The card which the showman had put in his 
hand ; 
Then he laid it away in his pocket with care, 
And, glancing around with a 
pious air, 
He remarked, as he sauntered out of the store, 
"I never attended a 
cirkis afore, 
But I 
reckon that now I'll have to go, 
As I've got a 
free ticket to this here show !"

THE PLACE WHERE I 
WAS BORN. 
By FRED R EYNOLDS. 
I'm a-going down to Georgie, 
De place wha' I 
was born; 
I'm a-going to de cabin 
In amongst de cane and corn; 
For I'm getting old and gray, 
And before I 
go away 
I 
want to see de place wine I 
was born. 
Chorus.—I'm a 
trablin' back to dat good old 
house, 
Away down South in Georgie; 
For I'm getting old and gray, 
And before I 
go away 
I 
want to see de place wha' I 
was 
born. 
In de good old days before de war, 
How happy I 
was den; 
And how I 
wish within myself 
The war had never been; 
For I'm lonely now and sad, 
And I 
wish I 
never had 
Left de good old cabin home wha' I 
was 
born. 
Oh, well do I 
remember 
When poor ntassa set us free; 
He went an d 
jined de army 
rh o tight for liberty; • 
And de darkies went away, 
And I 
went with them to stay, 
And left de good ole place wha' I 
was born.

DANCING ALL THE DAY. 
By ROBERT M CK AY. 
When we were very small, 
Our mammas used to say, 
We were so awful queer, 
-We did not care for play ; 
From morning until night, 
We could not quiet stay— 
On airy footstep light 
We're dancing all the day. 
Refrain. — Jig, clog, give us a 
chance— 
We're the lads that like to dance. 
(Symphony.) 
Chorus.--,-From morning until night 
We cannot quiet stay, 
On airy footstep light 
We're dancing all the day. (Dance.) 
So now we must be off, 
Too long we cannot stay; 
But, if you like our style. 
We here again may stray ; 
We're always just the same— 
Not all those words can say, 
Our hearts are never sad, 
We're dancing all the day. 
(R(frain and chorus, as before.)

TAKING MUSIC LESSONS. 
INTEubocurrout.—Bones, from your frequent

THE GALLANT HORSE- POLICE, 
By H. ALSTON DARLEY. 
rye got a 
beau, a 
handsome beau, 
He's sergeant on the force, 
And every day I 
pass his way 
To see him on his horse; 
Apollo-formed, with grace adorned, 
How could I 
him resist? 
And oh, those lips, with carmine tips, 
Made only to be kissed. 
Chorus.—He's the pride of the police force, 
You should see him ride his horse. 
He's grand! sublime! My heart knows little 
peace. 
" 
To the right!" you should hear him shout, 
On parade, when the gang is out. 
And he's my beau, this sergeant of the gallant 
horse-police. 
Oh, he is simply grand, with his baton in 
hand— 
Of my affections he has got the lease; 
Of him the ladies rave, he is so grand and 
brave, 
My sergeant of the dashing horse-police. 
Like some grand duke he rides erect, 
This handsome beau of mine; 
With gentle pace, with stately grace, 
I 
think he's just divine. 
His face so fair, beyond compare, 
His eyes so piercing blue, 
With bright smiles greet me when we meet 
Upon the avenue. 
His eyes, so bright, fill with delight, 
And joy he can't conceal, 
And his surprise and love-lit eyes 
Denote affection real 
When him I 
pass, amid the mass 
That wander to and fro, 
And I 
can see smiles but for me 
Come from my gallant beau.

CHINESE LABOR. 
BY BARRY BLACKBURN. 
Now, white folks, all give me your attention, 
And listen closely to my rhyme, 
And unto you some facts I'll mention 
If you'll only give me time: 
The Pig-tailed Heathen from across the water 
is encroaching upon our liberties, 
And hoards the wealth he makes by washing, 
Or sends it home across the seas. 
12 
He has a 
walk like a 
double shuffle, 
Wears a 
pigtail three yards long, 
He has a 
smile like a 
cross-eyed turtle, 
And his name is either Sam, Lee or John ; 
He wears his shirt outside his breeches, 
And canal-boat shoes upon his feet; 
He's generally in the laundry business 
in sonic cellar on a 
back street. 
Now, my friends, this smiling heathen 
Is no fool as you quite understand; 
From washing shirts to playing euchre 
You must acknowledge he's an A 1 
hand ; 
His diet's eats and puppy dogs, 
And black- rat soup a 
/a 
Chinee, 
Birds' nests, rice and other trash, 
And never uses milk in tea. 
if John keeps coming as thick as ever, 
From the Flowery Kingdom across the sea, 
We'll have to move to some other country, 
Either Alaska, Black Hills or New Guinea, 
Or put a 
stop to this invasion 
Of the yellow chap from the land of tea; 
For, to use the words of Colonel Sellers, 
"There's millions in it" of Ch ince.

We'll sing to you of a 
regiment true 
You've often seen parade; 
The ladies dear both smile and cheer 
As we march on the esplanade; 
Our swords are bright and our hearts are light 
As we march off in platoons, 
The bravest band in all this land 
Is the -Inniskillen Dragoons.

in the Russian wars.

BOTH.—We're not afraid of the " Mulligan 
Guards," 
We've beat the " Skidmore" 
C00115; 
None dare deride, but look with 
Pride 
On the Inniskillen Dragoons. 
We've medals to show, where'er we go, 
For bravery and renown; 
We're of good cheer and fond of beer, 
And known throughout the town ; 
We make one slash at a 
plate of hash, 
And smile upon the ruin ; 
We're the hungry pair, I 
do declare, 
Of the Inniskillen Dragoons. 
Chorum. 
Hark! we hear the bugle clear 
That bids us march away, 
And bid auieu to all of you 
Until some other day ; 
Now, when we're off, pray do not scoff 
And call us two gossons ; 
But three cheers more and a 
tiger for 
The Inniskillen Dragoons.

And I 
travel ' round now on my shape, 
Which sets off this hat and old coat. 
first in the match business went, 
To illuminate cities at night; 
But my friends, 'stead of buying, went by ! 
And I 
found the match business quite light. 
I 
then to the lime business took, 
But this, too, I 
found was quite slack ; 
So I 
then tried the tailoring with 
This result—these old clothes on my back. 
Manufacturing powder I 
tried, 
Thinking soon in a 
mansion to sup ; 
But the powder exploded, and I 
And the mansion and business went up. 
Discouraged, I 
next tried the cars 
As conductor, and rode through the town ; 
But this time I 
didn't go up— 
I 
was bounced, for they said I 
knocked down

next in the baking line wrought, 
But this I 
soon found was no go -; 
For, try as T 
would. I 
could tte'er 
Get a

were to die, 
I 
would fail, e'en in death, as a 
stilt
