Interview with Gay Lincoln 
Airline Passenger Service Agent, Machinists Union Local 1885 
 
Debbie Fant (DF) All right.  This is Debbie Fant, January 17, 2013.  I’m at the Clark County Historical 
Museum in Vancouver, WA, and I’m talking with Gay Lincoln about his work as a , in the , Union 1374? 
(that union number was listed on the information DF received from the Clark Co. Historical Museum) 
 
00:00:25  
Gay Lincoln (GL)  My union happened to be Local 1885. 
 
 
DF:  1885.  Okay.  So, tell me a little bit about yourself.  You live here in, in, Vancouver? 
 
00:00:34 
GL:  Live here in Vancouver.  Been in Vancouver, this is the third time I’ve lived here, but since 1974.  
Here in Vancouver.   The first twenty years I was out near Battleground, and the recent 20 years I’ve 
been here in Vancouver City.   
 
DF:  Uh hmm.  Umm hmmm.  So you were a ticket agent?  Tell me about that.  How did you get into that 
line of work? 
 
00:01:02 
GL:  Uh, when I was working (clear throat—“Pardon me”) at Alcoa, a friend suggested that I take a 
correspondence course in how to become an airline ticket agent. Or work for the airline.  And, uh, so I 
took that correspondence course having been away from that, having been away from, out of touch 
with typing.  Taught myself again to touch type, and that’s still something that I have, the ability, to use 
all fingers.  Uh, took that correspondence course, went to Weaver Airline Personnel School in Kansas 
City, MO, and from there was hired by Bonanza Airline in Salt Lake City, UT. 
 
DF:  So, you were living in Vancouver.  (Yes) and you went to Weaver, to school.  How did you decide to 
go there? 
 
00:02:12 
GL:  Well, they were the, my friend had signed up for the same thing. And he received a reward if he was 
able to enlist someone else to come along. I was his reward (laughs).  So that was what got me into it. A 
trusted friend who I’d known all my life—still know him—still close. 
 
DF:  What kind of training did you receive there? 
 
00:02:39 
GL:  At that time, we learned how to read tariff books, how to read aircraft routings as far as establishing 
fares, ummm, and how to calculate those fares.  It was an intricate—intricate, that’s not the right word.  
It was a complicated system at that time.  Depended on where you were flying, how far you were flying, 
how many stops you made or did not make.  Depended on which type of aircraft you were flying and

whether you were flying first class or coach.  Whether propeller or jet (because we still had propeller 
planes in 1964, I think it was, yeah, ’64, when I began).   
 
And, so they taught us fares, how to talk to people, how to apply for jobs, even that sort of thing. Umm, 
but those , if that answers the question, that’s what I did. 
 
DF:  And so you think that was good training? 
 
00:03:43 
GL: It was good training.  And worthwhile, and useful. Umm, among the, outside the industry it would be 
silly, but one of the things was stressed in the training, and I’ve learned, is the three-letter city code  of 
every airport in the US and most of the world. It’s a silly thing, but whenever I see license plates, I see 
cities.  That’s all.  One of the things, yeah.  
00:04:16 
 
DF:  So from there you went to Salt Lake City? 
 
00:04:19 
GL:  Salt Lake City, Utah.  Spent  ten years there, at that time we did everything—as far as airlines, we 
did everything. Talked with the customers at the ticket counter.  Behind the ticket counter there was a 
teletype machine, and we recorded reservations on that teletype machine.  And at the same time 
recorded them also on 3 X 5 cards and, so that, each day when a flight number was due to depart, in the 
time leading up to that, we would go to that, we had a lazy susan roundtable with several slots, but we 
have 3X5 cards for each flight and by date and the passenger’s name, and you can see it was not 
computerized.  And then, after having checked the people in, we handled their baggage, loaded their 
bags, we also counted them onto the airplane and accepted their tickets that had been issued at the 
ticket counter.  We also did, in airline parlance, weight and balance.  It’s not enough to know  how much 
a plane weighs, you need to know the distribution of the weight,  so that how the pilot’s gonna take off. 
So we did, again, weight and balance, air cargo, did reservations.  We also took phone calls initially.  That 
very quickly went away to central phone calls. Plus, we did the public contact work.  
 
DF: Public contact, when people would come in and want information, or. . . 
 
GL: “What flight are you on today?”  Or,  “What city are you going to? Oh, let me see if I have your 
name.  Oh, see, I have your name, and you need to buy a ticket.”  And we’d mark that card paid, and 
different filings of those things.  
 
DF: And at that point did you, you took checks, or cash, or how did that work? 
 
GL: Yes, yes, checks and cash.  I’m sure they were around, I just don’t recall credit cards.  Checks and 
cash. 
 
DF:  I think they were just coming in in the 1960s.  Um hmmm. 
 
GL:  I don’t recall it at that time, working with credit cards. 
00:06:50

DF:  What did you like about that job? That was for Bonanza Airlines? 
 
00:07:01 
GL: Bonanza Airline (assumes radio voice) “Silver dart service nonstop, Salt Lake to Phoenix.” 
 
DF:  That was the only route they had? 
 
GL  Oh, no, the longest.  In 19, beginning in 1947, there were established regional carriers, and those 
regional carriers were , uh, the exact number escapes me, but probably 17 regional companies. And we 
were Bonanza Airline, operated in the southwest, just by comparison there was also a, there was a 
Northwest Airline, which operated in the northwest , there was a Southwest, which operated in 
California, Central Airline, Frontier Airline, Allegheny Airline, Monongahela Airline, Southern, North 
Central, name just a few. 
 
DF: Names that you don’t hear anymore. 
 
GL: Oh, long gone. Yes, correct.  Um, just , and as each airline was gobbled up, the smaller ones being 
taken by larger, in my instance, and that’s not in all instances, not all employee instances, each airline 
that took over, we  negotiated, because we had a union, we negotiated that we would go along with the 
airline.  That is, if you were gonna purchase the airline, I’m part of it. 
 
And so, we went right along with it.  That was a factor in pay.  And I was gobbled up four or five times, 
depends which way you count, but gobbled up four times, five different airlines. 
00:08:50 
 
DF: What sequence? 
 
00:08:54 
GL: First was Bonanza Airline, then there was a new concept.  And there was a merger among Bonanza, 
Northwest, and I’m saying Southwest, that’s not quite right. . . Pacific Airline!  Strike the word 
“Southwest,”  it was Pacific Airline.   
 
DF: That was the one out of California, right? 
 
GL: Yes.  That was the first merger.  A nightmare for us personally.  Communications?  How do you 
communicate among three airlines that have different systems?  How do you, okay, the nightmare for us 
was such poor communication, at the beginning, that when an airplane would land in Salt Lake City, we 
had one special person whose job it was to go out and find out what flight that was, where it came from, 
and where it was going.  
 
DF: Because you couldn’t tell from the control tower? 
 
GL: Well, we wouldn’t communicate with the control tower.  Entirely different setup.  Within the 
company we needed to know those things.   No, control tower has other controls to do, not those 
things, that we needed to know.  We needed to know, that, in order to board our passengers.

GL: Backing up a little bit, when the passenger comes in, “How’s my flight today?”  “Well, we’re not real 
sure.”  And that’s a headache, to tell people “I don’t know if your plane’s gonna be here or not.”  You 
learn not to say it that way.  (Laughs) 
 
But we didn’t know if it was gonna be there or not, but then we’d follow through with what it was.  
Most of the planes did come through most of the time, but our reservations records were a wreck 
because, remember I said 3X5 cards, well those 3X5 cards didn’t translate to the other airline. So that 
was a nightmare personally to work with passengers, that’s all. Took about a year to straighten that out. 
00:10:55 
 
DF: How did it get resolved? 
 
00:10:59 
GL: Howard Hughes bought the airline.  So it changed from being Air West to Hughes Air West.  Howard 
Hughes, now, you keep in mind I’m not a businessman, but as we understand the situation, Howard 
Hughes used the purchase price that he received from selling TWA to buy this airline. Things turned 
around immediately at Hughes Air West.  And, it was a successful airline for some number of years, and I 
dion’t recall the number of years.  Ummm, 
 
Then, there was another merger that had occurred, again, I don’t know years, but the merger between 
Central Airline and Southern Airline.  That airline became Republic.  They had been in business for a year 
or two, and that airline purchased. . . (who am I working for after Bonanza?)  
 
DF:  Uh, Hughes Air West. 
 
GL:  Purchased Hughes Air West.  Thank you.  They purchased Hughes Air West. 
 
DF:  And so, that then became, that was Republic? 
 
GL:  Hughes Air West became part of the Republic Airline. 
 
DF:  Which is Central and Southern? 
 
GL: and now, and now Hughes.  Yes.  That made it nationwide. 
 
DF:  Ahhh.  And how was that merger? 
 
00:12:35 
GL: Just fine.  You need to learn a new computer system by that time, but no particular difficulty.  They 
had training and things in place and worked out well.  Because it had been noted what should and 
should not be done during mergers.  What should be accomplished so that people with their feet on the 
ground—the workers—can do their job, function. 
 
DF:  So, you’re now working with computers.  When did the computers come in?

00:13:09 
GL: Probably with Hughes Air West was when we began being able to type things into the system and 
have it respond, have it write tickets for us, that is, physically produce a ticket.  And it was very 
important that a ticket be physically produced at that time.  That’s no longer the case. 
 
DF:  Do you remember your first day at work with Bonanza? 
 
GL:  No.  Do not.  Do not recall a first day or week or event. 
 
DF:  Was there anything at Bonanza during that time that was a way of bringing you into the fold?  Were 
there any traditions or were there any things that your co-workers did to, to. . . 
 
00:14:20 
GL:  No.  I understand your question, and, no.  Sorry!  We just worked.  As I recall, there was a person 
assigned to me to show me around (thank you!), and what to do and what not to do, where to go and 
where not to go, as far as being out where the aircraft are.  We call it a “ramp.”  Just those things. 
 
00:14:40 
You quickly learned who you can rely on as far as accurate information.  Who will talk with you, how to 
work among fellow employees.  At that time, mostly men.  Mostly men.  We had a 13-person station 
that operated 12-14 hours a day. I think we only had one woman, and eventually that grew to be 3.  It 
was an area that was, at that time, probably like most, was male-dominated.  
00:15:24 
 
DF:  So, when did, so, the union that you were in at that point was called what? 
 
GL:  Our first one was Bonanza Airline Association.  The next one was called ALEA—Airline Employees 
Association, was headquartered in Chicago.  That was the airline of Hughes Air West and Republic days.   
 
DF:  The first one was Bonanza?  
 
00:15:37 
GL:  BAA.  Bonanza Airline Association.  But those were the two unions at that time, leading up to there. 
 
DF:  So, from Republic, um, and then did you come out to Vancouver?  How did you get here? 
 
00:16:22 
GL:  Okay.  After the merger, which caused Republic Airline, we could bid on open positions within the 
company.  They first filled openings from within, and then went outside if they needed that.   
I had lived in Vancouver as a child from age 4 to age 12, lived here in Vancouver, then we moved to Salt 
Lake City. Then from Salt Lake City I went into the service, and after the service I came back to 
Vancouver.  Was in Vancouver for two years with Alcoa, and then I was given a choice of two or three 
places to go to as Bonanza Airline new hire, and I chose Salt Lake since I had lived there once and knew 
lots of people, because I went to high school and college there.   
00:17:23

DF:  So then you came out here, and transferred out. . . . 
 
GL:  Yes. And then, under Republic Airline 
 
DF:  You said that was in 1974? 
 
00:17:40 
GL:  I came to Portland in 1974 after working 10 years in Salt Lake City.   With the same type of system 
within the airline of being able to transfer wherever there were openings.  I put in bids for several 
northwest cities, and Portland came up a winner, for me, came up a winner.  Yes, came here in 1974. 
 
00:18:10 
GL:  In, back in like 1972, an acquaintance of mine up in Seattle (and this does lead someplace!), uh, 
decided that he wanted to wear a beard.  Well, we had within our contract in the company that our 
facial hair would not extend below the lobe of the year.  And you could have a mustache if it was short 
and well trimmed, but no goatees, no beards.  Well, he decided he wanted a beard.  Unfortunately at 
the same time that he decided he wanted to stop combing his hair.  He was a full-fledged hippie working 
in public contact, in public service, which just doesn’t, they don’t go together. Nothing wrong with either 
one of those, but they don’t go together.  They fired him.  He went through the. . . and the union 
wouldn’t back him because we had a signed contract, even with diagrams within the contract what you 
can and cannot wear and facial hair.  But he went through the, don’t know what the system would have 
been, but some kind of system, and they got his job back.  So he got his job back. Okay. 
 
So this brings us to the latter part of ’73, first part of ’74, when I was awarded a bid for Portland, 
Oregon. I liked the idea of sideburns.  As in Civil War-type sideburns. Those. So I had a one, a month of 
vacation, that I took in conjunction with my transfer to Portland.  We had a little caveat:  We couldn’t 
grow beards on the job.  Well, goodness gracious!  Okay.  So I had a month to grow a beard, and then I 
reported for work in Portland.  Best of my knowledge, I was the second person on the, in that airline 
system to have a beard.  And, I visited up here, and visited with the station manager, walked in with a 
full beard.  Not heavy, I’m not a heavily-bearded person.  And I was not his employee, but I would be in 
about two days.  Well, he couldn’t say anything about my beard because I didn’t work for him yet.  That 
might have been about the time, but then, when I came to work, everyone was just aghast that here 
was a person with a beard working in public contact.  And many people associated hippies and beards at 
that time. But, uh, that was a full beard.  And I soon learned to trim it back—not nearly as far as now—I 
learned that beneath my nose and around my mouth it was red, so I cut that out, and it was several days 
before I realized that now, all of a sudden, I had a “Lincoln” beard on Mr. Lincoln. But it was an accident, 
not. . .okay, well, okay. 
 
But that brought beards,. . . okay. . . 
 
DF:  Brought beards here to Portland. 
 
GL: Yeah.  Then, of course, everybody started doing that sort of thing, and to various degrees of 
continuation.  Mine has continued.  I’ve had this type of Lincoln-type beard longer than I had a bald chin, 
is the way I like to say it.  Lot of folks have “bald chins.”  Okay. 
00:21:47

DF:  I like that.  No, it’s great! 
 
GL:  All right. 
 
DF:  So, you moved out.  What airline were you working for in, uh, Portland. 
 
00:22:00 
GL: In Portland, it would’ve been Republic Airline.  And then Republic Airline was purchased by 
Northwest.  And that was relatively seamless, except that, with two airlines coming together in one city, 
there was a lot of movement that occurred.  “Movement” is the movement of employees. No one was 
supposed to lose their job because of a merger, and best of my knowledge, at that time no one lost their 
job because of the merger. But they did lose their home city.  If you wanted to have a job, you could 
have one and your. . . “we have choices for you of Memphis, Seattle, or New York.”  And what would 
you like as a homegrown Northwest boy? (Laughs) 
 
What that did was called. .  moves, transferred  everyone with less than 20 years. I was toward the 
bottom at that time, but I had about 21 years of seniority, and bottom of the heap in Portland, Oregon.  
Just that way.  They didn’t lose their jobs, but they moved to other cities.  Most of them chose to move, 
a few quit, but no one lost their job. 
00:23:21 
 
DF:  And you ended up your career with Delta?  Is that correct? 
 
00:23:26 
GL:  I retired in ‘03 from Northwest Airlines.  Subsequent to that, Delta Airlines purchased Northwest, so 
Northwest has ceased. So now I fly with Delta when I fly. 
 
00:23:42 
DF:  What was the biggest change in your job?  You can look back from 3X5 cards to computers, the way 
we use them now, that is a HUGE transition. 
 
00:23:56 
GL:  Five or six different computer systems as time went on from ’64 on, the biggest change, and the one 
I had difficulty with, I don’t remember whether it was in Oh-One or Two, 2001 or 2002, they brought in 
kiosks.  That is, a passenger could come up and tap the machine and we heard they had them back East, 
and eventually one came to Portland, or two, and they encouraged us to have people use that. We 
didn’t like that.  “We” being the employees who stood behind the counter.  Understanding that for 
every machine you have out there, there was going to be one less of “me” back here.  So, it was a 
personal thing. And by the time I, okay, so that . . .was probably the biggest change because there was 
no longer. . .Our title was “Passenger Service Agent,” and they no longer needed service agents, they 
needed machine service people.  That was the biggest change.  That began me thinking, and  um, I didn’t 
like the machines because I felt that it would replace me eventually.  Well, that’s probably the biggest 
change, because I didn’t go along with it.  That’s why I retired.  Not the only reason, but it was certainly 
one of the factors I retired.  They had machines out there, and I couldn’t do the things that I wanted to 
do with people, and specifically, for the passenger. 
00:25:45 
Interview with Gay Lincoln

DF:  Give me an example. 
 
00:25:52 
GL: Before the machines, when we did fares, you look in the computer and you find certain fares. And, 
this is why they went to kiosks.  But the fares were restrictive in that if you flew on a Tuesday, you 
couldn’t come, you could come back, you had to stay over a Saturday, and you could get a low fare. But 
if you left on Wednesday and came back on Saturday, it was quite high.  And if you left on Monday and 
came back on Friday, it was quite high.  So you had to fit the mold. 
  
 
00:26:35 
I had friends who worked at the airport who had worked minimum wage all their life sweeping, 
vacuuming floors, dusting the bathrooms, cleaning toilets.  Janitors.  Worked all their life doing that.  
They couldn’t possibly afford  the $700 it would cost to fly the 2-3 days of vacation they might get a 
year.  Maybe 4 days.  But they still couldn’t afford the $700-$800 fare to fly where they wanted to fly.  
And so I said, “Joe, no problem. Come see me.”  Okay.  “Where do you want to go?”  And they’d tell me 
where they wanted to go.  And you’d tap in the machine and say, “Okay, can you pay $350?” Yes, they 
could come up with $350.  So, I sell him to leave here on Tuesday, come back on Saturday, collect $350, 
and he had a ticket in his hand.   
 
NOW, I go back into the computer, it’s still a computer, change the dates, change the times he wants to 
fly to what suits his schedule, and lo and behold!  He’s on the plane and going to leave on Tuesday 
morning, come back Friday morning, he gets to see his relatives, he spends his hard-earned $350, and 
we have $350.  Now.  That done, and I have other lengthy stories of even more monies saved, by doing 
that kind of manipulation.  However, it’s not the kind of saving that the airline appreciated.  That’s not 
the type of saving that a business appreciates.  My self defense has always been, will continue to be, and 
still is, those are revenues we would NOT have gotten had I not done that.  Not good enough!  When 
they catch people doing that—Pardon me! Past tense.—when they caught people doing that, they were 
fired. That’s called “revenue leakage.”  You can’t do that.  We have these rules, they have this setup, and 
they are very bright people who arrange fares and know how to get people to spend money.  Good.  
Good for them. 
 
00:28:56 
That was the second factor in changes that, a second factor that caused me to leave the airline. I’d get 
fired if I stayed doing that.  I would get fired.  And I did that for several people, and yes, they were my 
friends.  And yes, that was patently illegal.  (No, no, no, no, no!!) Improper.  Not illegal.  Not illegal, 
improper.  Doesn’t fit  the business mold, doesn’t fit the way they worked dollars, and just didn’t work.   
 
00:29:28 
Anyway.  Those two factors.  Ummm.  Not being able to talk with the people. They didn’t want us to talk 
to people.  They didn’t want us visiting with people. They wanted people to use the kiosks.  And that’s 
the way it is now.  You don’t talk with people—the agents.  
00:29:42  
 
DF:  I know that there are people who have to help people with the kiosks, because. . . 
Interview with Gay Lincoln

00:29:49 
GL:  Certainly!  Oh, yeah.   Oh.  Okay, another little issue.  SO.  They hire people to HELP people at the 
kiosks.  By this time, the people behind the counter are relatively highly paid.  Now, wealthy?  No.   
Highly paid in the terms of business expense?  Yes.  So they hire people who only know how to push 
buttons out there and pay them less money. 
 
Well, wait a minute!  “We’ve got a contract!”  “No, this is outside the contract.”  So we have difficulties 
within the airline and between the union and the company.  What should these people be paid?  Why 
can’t you, why don’t you pay them?  Well, if you’re taking it away from us, why do you pay them less, 
and. . .  you understand the argument, I expect.  Simple on its face. 
00:30:38 
 
 
DF:  So, did you have, did you have names for, uh, difficult passengers? 
 
GL:  (Laughs to himself)  Pet names? 
 
DF:  That, that, if you had said something to a fellow service agent, they would understand what you 
were talking about?  
 
00:31:00 
GL:  I don’t recall.  One of the things I learned and try to pass on and I had occasion to pass it on to lots 
of people:  In that position, you got, one receives, the SAME question hour after hour, day after day, and 
you need to answer that question as though that person thinks they are the first one who’s ever come 
into that problem.  Um, but did we name them?  Certainly not that I remember.  That’s the kind of thing 
I would hope I didn’t do.  Since I don’t remember it, maybe I didn’t! 
00:31:47 
 
DF:  What were the questions that you would get over and over and over? 
 
00:32:50 
GL: Laughs.  Well, the obvious is, “Is the plane on time?”  What type of plane is it?  How fast does it go? 
What’s the weather like? Is the plane full?  Ummm.  Are you SURE that’s what the fare is?  Well, if I 
wasn’t sure I wouldn’t tell you!  Uhhh.  “Really?” That’s a . .  Y es, it’s always “REALLY?” You’ve got to be 
kidding.  Because airlines—it costs to fly.  It still does. It still does.  It’s an expensive proposition.  At the 
same time, the only thing worth selling is an empty seat.  It’s a service.  And, no, I don’t recall name-
calling or attaching. . .  
 
There was one period of time at the ticket counter with Republic Airline, and I believe it was for five or 
six years.  We had no supervisor.  Because no one wanted to be a supervisor. But we understood that 
that was from a personal structure, and we were small enough that we could do that among ourselves. 
That, we couldn’t tell the public that!  “No one’s in charge!”  So, if you needed a supervisor, you could 
say, “Supervisor!”  And that was the person next to you.  And, within the next several minutes, if that 
person had a problem, I was the supervisor.  And we would listen to whatever was going on.  “Surely 
you don’t mean that I have to pay more money?” Anyway.

DF:  Then you would stand up for your fellow . . . 
 
GL:  No!  You don’t need to do that. Umm.  I never felt any compulsion.  We want that person to be 
right, but no, if there’s wiggle room, we would call a spade a spade.  You don’t need to pay more money.  
You don’t need to go through Albuquerque to get to Chicago.  You just don’t need. .  “Yes, the rule says 
that but I’ll be able to sign off on that as a supervisor.  I’ll authorize you to do it just this one time, not 
again!  But you can do it this one time.”  So that person’s special, they love your airline, they get to do 
what they want to do.  I don’t recall names or pet names.  
00:34:40 
 
DF:  Do you remember any. . . So, now I’m gonna see if you remember any , any, issues that stood out.  
Say, boy I remember the time when. . . 
 
GL:  Yes!  (Df laughs) 
 
DF:  Please tell me! 
 
00:34:56 
GL:  And it’s not worth writing a book, either.  Had lady who wanted to write a check, and she had a 
counter check.  And counter checks, I’m sure they’re passé now, were just a blank check.  And you 
entered what your name and address was on the top of it.  But by that time we had a proviso it had to 
be a pre-printed name and address, personal check.  And this lady wanted to write us a check.  And the  
the supervisor’s, I didn’t have her, he had the lady.  And he said, “No.  I can’t take your check.” But she 
said, “But I have this deposit slip shows this morning that I put all this money in the bank.”  And he says, 
“No, that’s not the point.  It’s a counter check.  We can no longer accept counter checks, can’t do that.” 
And this particular individual was a dour—that’s how I’d describe his appearance—dour.  You couldn’t 
really tell when he smiled. He did, occasionally, but the lady was irate after them going back and forth 
several minutes.  And she says, “I’m not leaving this town without (pounds on desk). . . .”I’m not leaving 
until I get that ticket.”  And he says, “Portland’s a nice place to live.” 
 
Okay.  (laughter)  Didn’t smile, didn’t look one way or the other, looked her right in the eye. “Portland’s 
a n ice place to live.”   Okay.  (chuckles) 
 
DF:  She didn’t get her ticket. 
 
GL:  No.  No.  Ummm.  That might be the lady, I don’t want to make stories up, that might be the lady 
who then threw her purse at him and then walked away.  The purse was empty.  So, he had made a right 
decision.  That sticks out. 
00:36:50 
 
00:36:54 
GL: Things that stand out in my mind:  In, um, Salt Lake City, we were working air cargo.  For some, oh 
the police came out to the ticket counter, identified themselves, and said, there’s going to be a 
shipment arrive, and I believe it was from San Jose—that’s not important where it came from.  There 
was going to be a shipment arrive from San Jose, and a fellow named, and be addressed to a fellow, Joe

Doe--John Doe! (Gotta get the name right!), forget the right name.  And John Doe, he will come out and 
pick it up. We will have people out here.  We know that this will be, these will be drugs, and we want to 
arrest that person.  And we want you to proceed in this, in a certain manner.  And they had two people 
who dressed—and we wore specific uniforms at that time, not fancy but they were uniforms—and they 
had two, we’ll call them undercover agents because they were dressed like we were.  There was one 
outside and there was one inside, plus there were some out in the main lobby.  And when that 
individual showed up to pick up his package, they just all converged within a little office that we had 
there, and there were guns drawn, and the men and the lady immediately stopped what they were 
doing and they put their hands up, and the lady started haranguing on the police:  “You don’t need to do 
guns, and you’re picking on us, and. . .” and the guy says, “You shut up.  I had a friend distracted by that 
kind of noise, and he got shot.  You shut up.” And she shut up.  And they arrested ‘em.  And hauled ‘em 
off.  But that’s the world of, I’ll say the word “crime,” cause I’m outside that world, that is, there are 
people who tell on other people.  We knew before, we knew that he was coming, we knew what to 
expect, and they arrested them.  Stands out, because there were guns drawn.  And people handcuffed 
and led away. 
00:39:18 
 
00:39:19 
On another occasion, we had, this was the FBI.  The FBI came out and said, there will be a fellow coming 
out today, he’s going to use this name, and buy a ticket to Phoenix.  You don’t need to do anything, he 
said, I’ll be sititng over there, he said, I want to know when that person comes out.  Who that person is 
when he buys that ticket.   I said, yeah, okay.  He said, I want you to tell me , but I don’t want him to 
know that you’re telling me.  That’s fine, I can do that.  And sure enough, two hours later a fellow came 
up, gave the exact name the FBI agent said, um, purchased a ticket from Salt Lake City to Phoenix, and 
then back the following day.  And he had the prescribed amount of money, as he paid me, and I 
completed, as I recall, writing the ticket out. . . .No, it would’ve come out of the computer.  As I was 
handing it to him, I used my fingers to point down to the ticket, which immediately drew his vision down 
to my finger, where I was pointing, and nodded at the agent who was sitting several yards away.  The 
agent nodded back, and the fellow walked away.  
 
Two days later, they came out, and said, okay, that plane’s coming in, we expect our person’s going to 
be on there, and we want to apprehend him when he gets off the plane.  I don’t know if he was a mule 
hauling money or hauling stuff.  It doesn’t matter, I didn’t need to know.  At that time, when they got off 
the plane, there were steps that led down to the ground, and then they walked into the building.  
Several of the agents were attired in maintenance uniforms, and as the people got off trailing like ants, 
because that’s good, they’re supposed to and we encourage them to, to the door, one of the agents 
took a four-wheel chart and kind of went among the people, which scattered the people.  About that 
time there were agents coming from either side, and they came all three of them around and got the 
one fellow they wanted, picked him out, and took him away.  Yeah, that’s exciting.   
 
There are various places where you could stand and see where the plane is and see where the people 
are.  And one of the places where you can stand and see when the people are getting off the airplane is 
different from where they arrive.  The exit door is different from the, the  egress door is different from 
the entrance door. There had been a person there meeting the individual who was just arrested.  He 
saw that the individual was coming down the stairs, moved around to meet the guy, and uh, couldn’t 
see this transaction, which was quick, easy---quick and easy, they led him away.  And he was standing

there, and I went over to close the door, and he said, “Is everybody off?”  And I said, “everybody’s 
gotten off.”  And he kind of looked back and forth with his eyes, turned around, ran out of the airport.  
Because he understood what had happened.  But, okay.  Those are things that occur.  They stand out. 
00:42:40 
 
DF:  Well, I know, having flown out of Salt Lake often, and knowing what the weather is, how did you 
deal with, with weather conditions where flights were delayed or cancelled? That makes people cranky. 
 
00:43:05 
GL:  You can only tell ‘em, and they holler and shout and threaten, and it doesn’t change the situation.  I 
don’t recall a learning process.  But when you talk about weather, one of the things that Salt Lake 
enjoys, enjoys ??, is temperature inversion.  (DF:  Yep)  Boy, you’ve really been there!  During one of 
those temperature inversions, it lasted for about a week, dense fog, well, we learned, they learned—the 
airline industry learned—that they could seed those clouds, ah, there’s a word for it.  It’s like dry ice. 
Drop dry ice and that freezes all the fog, and it cleares it up.  And, um,  they did that for two-three days, 
they woeuld spray the, someone might know what, nitric oxide—dry ice.  That’s what my best. . . 
 
And it would clear up and a plane or two would take off, and then that fog, that situation, would roll 
right back in. So we had lengthy delays on that.  When you encounter weather delays in other cities, it’s 
a little bit more difficult to explain.  Ah, you just deal with a very ugly situation.  Ugly being that no one’s 
happy.  They blame you because you’re the messenger—you’re the messenger and they blame you. I 
have two or three friends now that I worked with who would not/could not/did not put up with that, 
and they quit.  Just because of that unwillingness to put up with that sort of behavior.  People that had 
unreasonable requests and unreasonable demands and unreasonable language. 
00:44:54  
 
DF:  So.  Um. I just forgot what I was. . . 
 
GL:  That’s all right. 
 
00:45:05 
DF:  The hub system.  How did that change your work when the airline industry switched from  flying to 
the hub system, and where were you when that occurred? 
 
00:45:24 
GL: That would have been Republic as they moved into that.  How did that affect me? When they went 
to that system, we lost a few people again because of the seniority system.  They could bid wherever 
there was anyone junior to them and displace that individual, those individuials, but I never had to make 
that move because of that.  How did that affect it?:  Closed little places like Chico, California; Eureka, 
Arcata California, Grand Canyon, Arizona, Flagstaff.  That’s because those were close, as I remember, 
close to Salt Lake City, when the hub/spoke system.  Um.  Regular service to Aspen was disconnected.  
How did it affect it?  Distributed our people.  In a nutshell.  Distributed our people to larger cities, and 
the airline perception of more efficient use, and I think since it has continued, that it probably is. A lot 
less staffing.  Certainly no increase in staffing.   
00:46:47

DF:  Were there any stories that were generally known among the passenger service agents that sort of, 
cautionary tales, that may or may not have been true, but everyone knew them, which would tell you 
how to or how not to, uh, work, you know, with uh, you know, cautionary tales that were passed along. 
 
00:47:23 
GL:  I understand your question and can’t think of anything. . . but, “cautionary.”  We, during the days of 
Howard Hughes, which was a little over a year, we would receive a phone call in the afternoon from an 
identifiable person, not random, and they would tell us that there would be an individual come to the 
airport at a specific time in the evening, and that at the same time there should be a plane arriving, and 
that plane will pull up to your gate, and they’ll put their stairs down, and you’ll let that individual go out 
to the airplane, and they’ll converse, that person will come back, and they’ll get back in the airplane, and 
when they taxi out, they’ll tell you how long until they get to the next destination. We don’t know 
whether it was a transfer of information or a transfer of money, but it was a Howard Hughes 
organization proposition, and those jets would come in almost monthly into Salt Lake City.  And a person 
would meet them, they’d exchange briefcases, and that plane would fly off.  We don’t know where they 
went to, except judging by the time, we knew that it wasn’t Denver or Phoenix, oh, someplace in 
California.  But cautionary tales. . . 
 
DF:  So, did you have a name for those planes that came in? What did you call them? 
 
GL; Well those would go through the control tower.  We didn’t have names, I didn’t work the company 
control tower either.  The company radio, I didn’t work that. I let the nefarious people out and back in.  
Um. They would have used call signals—their tail numbers of the aircraft, that’s what they would have 
used.  Okay.  No, there was no secret code as far as that.  It’s just who they were, where they came 
from, where they went, we never knew.  We were encouraged not to ask. 
00:49:51 
   
00:49:54 
DF:  You said you retired in 2003.  (uh hmmmm) So, that means you were working, were you working on 
9/11? 
 
GL:  Yes. 
 
DF:  Tell me. 
 
GL:  Wait a minute.  I happened to be off that day, I wasn’t working that day.  But subsequent to that, 
we were instructed to give, within a very short while, probably less than a day, to give refunds and 
explain that we weren’t flying, that no one was flying.  Incidentally, I learned that there was one plane 
that next day that flew, but, uh, that’s beside the point.  It wasn’t uh, that flew the Bin Laden family out 
of the United States.  BUT!!  Uh, rumor.  Okay.  Back to the story.  
00:50:32  
 
00:50:34 
We gave refunds and were to re-route people for a later time.  Nothing was flying. And we were told to 
do it for a week out. And very quickly a week out filled up, so then what you had was the difficult 
situation of saying that, “Yes I’ll give you a refund,” and “yes, I can rebook you a MONTH from now. “ 
Interview with Gay Lincoln

Well, again, not happy folks.  I don’t recall any being badgered by poor behavior.  I don’t recall that at 
all.  Um.  I don’t recall that at all.  As I recall, there was a two-week period, uh, so what did that do?  All 
of the more junior people, junior than me, by that time I had close to 30 years, maybe over, were laid 
off.  There were a few of us who worked through that to have those tales of woe to give the traveler, 
and time after time, and “Nope.” “ Yes, we’ll refund your money”-- as much as possible, as much as 
legal.  As much as proper, not legal. As much as proper.  And rebook you at a later time.  That later time 
came, and there still weren’t planes flying.  And people, “But you made a reservation for me.”  Yes, but 
they’ve moved that date, there’s still nothing flying.  I think it was two weeks of “No, no, no, no, no.” 
Giving money back.  So.  9/11. 
00:52:10 
 
00:52:12 
And then began the reams and reams of paperwork explaining what we could and couldn’t do with 
passengers.  What we should and shouldn’t do. The hysteria of making things safe. And I think we still 
suffer from that hysteria.  Anyway.  Um. 
 
Reams of paper and training classes.  And then they had other people who did the inspection.  But we 
needed to know how to use the machines that detected explosives, detected on your clothes or on your 
fingers.  Still needed to know how to do that even though it wasn’t our function, but just in case. Well, 
you need to know that. Well, okay.  So we did.  
 
00:52:58 
That’s when they came up with the special identification cards that showed I could get to this spot, and I 
could go through here without being searched.  And we learned the most efficient routes where to get 
without having to be searched.  And proper routes.  Because we couldn’t be standing in line for half an 
hour to get down to work.  But lots of rigorous testing, and fingerprinting.  And of course we objected to 
being fingerprinted, but that didn’t go very far. Because we’d been honest and working for the  
company for 15, 20, 30 years, now you’re, now you don’t trust me?  Yep.  Now we don’t trust you. Okay.  
Very small hitch, very small hitch.   
 
00:53:53 
I gave you two reasons I retired. One was the dramatic changes  with the computer, the other was my 
relationship with people.  To give you an idea of how I work with people, it would have been in 02, 2002, 
a person came up, checked in with me, left his bags with us, then we had them inspected.  There was a 
substance in his luggage, a powder, and they wanted to know from the passenger what that powder 
was.  Well, I’d checked the person in and did his baggage, and they can tell by looking at baggage who 
checked what bag, who wrote it, caused it to print.  They came back to me, and I said, Yeah, I recall that 
guy.  And I went around the corner, and the line was an hour long.  I mean, this tip to this tip was an 
hour. 
 
DF:  TO get through security? 
 
GL:  TO get through security.  And that was a common thing. At that time.  Now they’re doing quite well. 
 
But he was about halfway through.  And I had to go over and, “Mr. Jones, and I might have, at home, I 
still have his name.  Came over and they interviewed him as to what that was, and he said, no, that’s 
Interview with Gay Lincoln 
Archie Green Fellowship: Washington State Works 
 
 
15 
 
 
some kind of developing powder, I think. And he said, if you look in this other place, that shows that I do 
photo work.  That’s some kind of powder for photo. Well, okay, thank you.  Well, now what do I do?   
Well, Joe Doe, I just pulled him out of line, he’s been waiting half an hour, the line’s an hour long, he’d 
probably still make his flight.  But I said, “Joe, don’t worry about it.  Just. . “ Because he said, “Do I get 
back in line?” I said, no.  So I went over to a door.  Secure door. And put my very secure badge through, 
punched in my secure numbers, opened the door, let him in. Closed the door.  He’s on there without 
having to go through that doggone line.  Very good customer service! Bad for security. 
 
00:55:59 
As it happened, there were two people who were standing , sitting facing that door which was a ways 
away, but they were facing it, and they saw the door op0en and a fellow come through who was a 
civilian because he wasn’t UNE-I-FORMED, they wondered what was going on.  They were properly 
doing their job.  I can’t fault ‘em of that.  One fellow followed the individual.  One person went to the 
authorities and . . .”(little whiny voice that goes up and down but you can’t discern words)” Okay.  
Raised the question.  Now what’s going on here? 
 
So they came down and interviewed him. And, course, he’s under tremendous scrutiny, I don’t think a 
lot of pressure, but, “Who did this to you?  Who did this for you? “ “Well, it was Mr. Lincoln.”  So, they 
came and interviewed Mr. Lincoln. The manager, with whom I had a good relationship even though he 
was MAN-AGE-MENT and I was union, and represented our individuals with him, and through him, was 
really disappointed because I was a good agent.  But he was really disappointed and , he said, “I can’t 
talk to you now,” because he was so angry.  But because those two individuals had done the correct 
thing and, one kept the passenger in. . . , and one did the tattle-taling, I shouldn’t use that, but one 
tattled.  Because they always had that person in their view. If they had not, the other alternative would 
have been to Empty. The. Airport.  And not only one hour but several hours. The punishment to me was 
two weeks off without pay.  I said, okay.  Union called me up.  I was never high in the union, never chose 
to be, wouldn’t want to be.  Union called me and said, “Look , Gay.  We worked with you all these years.  
We can get you off, don’t worry about it.”  I said, “No.  Don’t.  If you get me off, you’ve got to get 
everyone else off who makes a mistake.  We, I, don’t learn anything from it.  If you do that, that 
weakens our position with these other people in the union, and they need to know that’s not the right 
thing to do.”  So, I accepted my two weeks off without pay, even though my exemplary record and years 
of service doesn’t excuse you from making a very grievous mistake.  I’d read those reams of paper, but 
somehow in there it didn’t translate that I was no longer in charge of my passengers.  I no longer knew 
what was good for my people.  I no longer knew what was good for the individual I worked for, with, the 
passenger.  So those were the three, among the three events.  Plus, monetarily, I could do it. Retire.  
Okay.  But I was making mistakes. If I made that mistake, maybe I’m making others, and maybe it’s time 
to leave.  It was a mistake.  Wrong. 
 
00:59:08 
DF:  So, there was a monumental change in the culture of how you worked. (uh huh, uh huh)  And what 
your description, I mean, how  you saw, understood your job as a passenger service agent. . . 
 
00:59:24 
GL: You’re right.  Yeah.   It took a long time, but I knew for at least the last ten years, I was a servant.  
Just plain and simple, a servant.  Enjoyed it, liked it, just really enjoyed the repartee, the give-and-take 
for the several seconds or several minutes I had a passenger, they could give me their best stories.  
Interview with Gay Lincoln 
Archie Green Fellowship: Washington State Works 
 
 
16 
 
 
Whatever they were.  And, I could use the same story all day long! (laughs) But I liked the fact that they 
could open up and give whatever’s big on their mind.   
 
00:59:58 
One of the more valuable classes that I had with the airline was learning how to listen.  Listen to what 
people say.  And listen to what they mean. Often, what they say is not what they mean. So you need to 
discern, what did they really mean by that question? Beyond, “how’s the weather?”  Beyond, how much 
is the fare?   
 
DF:  (in background) How do you do that? 
 
01:00:27 
GL:  Sigh.  I dunno, I suppose you judge by appearances.  You can judge a horse by its color.  You can tell 
if it’s a black horse, it’s gonna be a bad person riding it!  You know when they’re telling a lie.  When 
they’re telling you a sob story when they’ve gotta get here, and they’ve gotta get there, and, gee, they 
just don’t have the money, and maybe you could look around this.   
 
No, this is the rule, and this is the law, no not the rule, but this is the rule, and  I need to follow that. 
Now, earlier, I told you there were ways around that I do it? (DF: um hmmmm) Yes, there are.  Do I go 
around every time? No.  There are peole who are wearing diamond rings and diamond studs, um, fancy 
clothes and fancy suitcases, and they griping over 10, 20, 30 dollars, and no, I’m not gonna give in.  Yes, 
I’m judging horses by their color.  Did I say that right?  You bet.  How do you tell?  You just feel it. (DF:  
You learn over time?)  Yep.  Judge quickly.  My, in my limited judgment, I’m not a psychologist, but I can 
tell by looking, I feel  I can tell by looking, particularly after talking with them, are they a worker or not a 
worker?  Since I feel I was a worker, I can identify workers and non-workers. And you look at their 
hands.  Do they have impressions where rings used to be? Are they nervous? Do they look at you? Do 
they not look at you? Do they blink or not?  Do they look left or right? You know, no, I dunno.  You just 
listen.  And if you’re not sure, answer their question with something that causes them to ask more 
questions.  And eventually you learn, “Ohhhh, so you have someone else who’s flying.  Oh yes, well,  You 
should’ve told me that the first time.”  You don’t say that, but. . . what do they really mean? 
01:02:40 
 
DF: How was it working with the flight crews? 
 
01:02:44 
GL  Mostly good.   
 
DF:  What were issues that you might have?] 
 
GL:  They wanted us to clean the plane, and we wanted THEM to clean the plane!  (Laughts)  That’s an 
issue we might have!  Um, but that was usually handled at levels above us. Took it out of our hands.  
 
Issues?  Counts. I count 47 and you count 49.  Well, I’ve got to go through my little pile of tickets, and 
you’ve got to go through your seats and count empty seats, and uh, little issues.  No, we got along fine.  I 
don’t recall. . .there were some people we disliked.  Abrasive attitudes. That was either that person’s 
fault or our fault. I say “our” because there were some people I disliked because they were abrasive.  
Interview with Gay Lincoln 
Archie Green Fellowship: Washington State Works 
 
 
17 
 
 
Yes.  Nah, not , I don’t recall issues. 
 
They want us to  hurry and passengers only walk so fast.  We want to close the door but they can’t allow 
it until everyone’s seated. Uh.  I don’t recall major conflicts at all.  I don’t recall conflict other than what I 
just said. 
01:04:09 
 
01:04:12 
DF:  Pretty amazing. Now what about any luggage incidents that you recall? Just, going down, thinking 
about my own travel stories, and, um, because you’d check the luggage in and put it on a belt or put it in 
a cart, and that changed over time. Plus, the limits! 
 
01:04:32 
GL:  Oh, ho ho (laughs about limits). They built in scales for us.  And we could often look the other way. 
And that’s where people always wanted to be an exception and not pay the ride, pay the amount for the 
added cargo, added weight. Where it particularly came into play was when we served Portland-Seattle, 
and Seattle went to the Philippines.  And I pick on the Philippines because, the Philippines and Africa, 
that’s international travel where there’s lots of heavy stuff.  People going to the Philippines would take 
with them enough things that were in short demand in the Philippines that they could more than pay for 
their fare by taking it.  And as I recall, it was simple thing s like coffee, cocoa, and shoes, but this was a 
long time ago.  I wouldn’t, I don’t think that’s the case now. Um. And they didn’t want to pay the fare.  
And we learned you had to pay it. We learned to say, “No.  You will pay it or it doesn’t go.”  
 
Going to Africa. I recall one time where we had a person whose luggage was too heavy.  And he said, 
“That’s okay.  I’ll make it light, I’ll make it light.”  Opened up the suitcase, and he had 70 pounds of 
women’s shoes, just shoes. And Sure enough, they threw shoes out until it was down to the weight. Was 
going to Africa where apparently shoes are in short demand—short supply, high demand.  Okay, that’s a 
luggage issue. 
 
01:06:27 
May come later, but, luggage issues.  Mostly came when people wanted to send a whole bunch of stuff 
and not pay a whole bunch of money. That’s what it boiled down to. Had one fellow who I made the 
mistake of letting his luggage go and not charging him, and he hounded me then for years to always do 
The. Same. Thing.  And he still, we’re still friends, because he wanted to be friends. Benefitted him.  But 
he’s moved back to the Philippines, so he’s no longer a thorn in my side. (whispers to himself, 
“Luggage.”) 
 
01:07:21 
DF:  What was the benefit of being in a union?  What did, what was. . .  
 
01:07:27 
GL:  Well, um, the issue that I indicated which caused my retirement, an element in retiring. Can’t fire 
them for one incident. Okay.  You need, it needs to be grave, it needs to be over a period of time. Your 
question again?  What about. . . the benefit? 
 
DF: what’s the benefit, yeah.  Were you glad to be a union member? 
Interview with Gay Lincoln 
Archie Green Fellowship: Washington State Works

GL: Happy to be a union member. Outside of the service—Marine Corps—I’ve always been in the union.  
And I understand that a union can do a great deal for me in bargaining with a company, than I can 
bargain with a company.  And the union can make a great deal more of the argument that, how valuable 
I am.  How “dollar-worth” I am to the company.  They can make a better issue of it than I can. So.  Those 
things.

01:08:58 
GL:  One of the more memorable times was a sleepy Sunday morning.  Sleepy means hardly anybody 
around.  And a lady walked up and purchased from me a one-way ticket and paid cash, which was 
generally unique, but paid cash to go Portland-Seattle.  Uh. This is, okay, Portland-Seattle.  And she went 
down to the gate, and after she had left, as soon as she left I went back and stood in the doorway that 
led to the back room and stood there talking to people who were in the back room, and no customers, 
and several minutes passed, and I looked up there where she and I had been, and there was an 
envelope.  Just a regular, Number 10 envelope.  And it felt like it had money in it.  The weight.  Not a lot 
of money, but it had money  in it. I went down to the gate, before the flight boarded, and I would have 
had a record of her name.  “Is Mrs. Thus-and-such here?”  I didn’t hold the envelope up.  I said, “Is Mrs. 
Thus-and-such,” you know, whatever the name is.  And, no response.  Then, after the flight left, I said, 
let’s look at those tickets.  We looked at the tickets, and the name wasn’t on there.  That I had just sold a 
one-way ticket.  Okay.  So, the plane left, went to Seattle.  I called Seattle, got hold of the person at the 
gate where the plane was arriving, and said, “Page this person, and tell them they need to contact me 
here in Portland about money.”  And he called me back, and said, “No, nobody responded.”  Then I 
opened it up.  There was $900.00 in there.  Okay.  What do I do? 
 
Well, just whatever you call it. Bull-headed or cautious.  I didn’t want to give it to the company. Because 
I knew. . . I didn’t want to give it to the company. So I went in to the manager—that would’ve been the 
next morning, because on Sunday, he’s not there.  The next morning I went in and explained the 
situation like I did to you, I said, I’m keeping that money.  Now, if somebody comes up and wants it, 
they’re welcome to it.  I said, but they need to identify how much it was and the circumstances they lost 
it, I’ll be happy to share it with them. Give it back.  But I’m not gonna give it to you.  What does the 
union do for you?  Lets you do that.  But he went along with that.  And three months later, I helped pay 
my wife’s doctor bill with, I think , our child number three.  Never found out who, what, or where. And I 
don’t know what amount I might have said, but I think it was $700. And I never exaggerate!! (laughs) 
01:11:55 
 
Well, yeah. That’s very memorable. 
 
01:12:02 
DF:  Well, I think, I think I’ve learned a lot.  Oh!  There was one more question.  And it has to do with, 
um, before the computerized, it was when you were still using the airline books to do the tickets. 
(“Tariff, tariffs.”)  Those were, because I’ve gone through a few of those, I ordered one of those once 
back in the 80s. .

GL:  A bound book? OAG?  (Official Airline Guide) 
 
DF:  Yes!  OAG.  And to try to figure out fares for myself before you could book fares, to get an idea of 
what I would need, and it was fascinating.  How did you, you’d have to get quick with that.  How did you 
develop the skills and the speed.  And how often, you were issued. . . 
 
01:13:07 
GL: I think they were monthly. They began to cut down later, but that doesn’t matter.  It got dog-eared.  
You know you wanted to go to “P” for Phoenix or D for Denver or S for Seattle, and it just got dog-eared 
and you knew how to go to that. And you knew how to read that.  By that time it was also in the 
computer as well as being there. It’s just, you didn’t always have flight times and routing in there, didn’t 
always have that. But, you mentioned that OAG, that’s something that you as a traveler were familiar 
with, the other thing that we had up there on the ticket counter was a rack about this wide (I’m showing 
about 2-3 feet long), page after page after page of showing routings and where you could route them 
and how much you could charge when they routed that way.  Just, amazingly complicated.  No, it 
sometimes took time.  Yes, you needed to be quick, but you needed to be thorough, because although it 
wasn’t an advertising slogan, you wanted to get the lowest fare possible.  
01:14:17 
 
DF:  And, what was your relationship with travel agents? 
 
01:14:24 
GL:  Very good. And we haven’t described my job versus a travel agent.  A travel agent needs to know 
about five times what I know because they need to know boats and uh, rail, and several other things.  
And I get five times as much pay. What does the union do for you? It establishes the value. Okay.  Back 
to your old question.  It establishes the value.  
 
Now, but we had good relationships with them because we could always call them if there was a 
question with one of their tickets.  And we could generally straighten it out a lot quicker than dealing 
with the traveler.  But, no, there was good.  And we wanted. . . at that time, the airline wanted travel 
agents to issue tickets because there wasn’t enough time for us to do it. 
 
(coughs.  Debbie asks if he wants to drink some water.  He says, might help) 
 
And, um, they were less expensive than we were.  Knew that even then, knew that even then. Didn’t 
mean to toot my own horn, but you’re asking about me, hmmm? 
01:15:39 
 
DF:  I’m askin’ about you!  That’s absolutely it.  I’m asking about you and your experiences.  Well, I’ve 
gotten quite a tutorial, and I know I’ll have more questions later, but, I can’t think of anything else to ask 
unless you can think of something else that, um, 
 
01:16:03 
GL:  Baggage!  Baggage!   I was leaving the Portland airport, I was off duty, and was walking down among 
the cars in a row, and ahead were some talking and back and forth, two or three cars, and they left

soon’s I got up there.  Set of golf clubs.  NICE set of golf clubs, complete with the cover and three wood 
drivers, and 9 and a putter and some balls and a. . .Puma.  PUMA was the brand bag. And they were 
gone! Clubs were there.  So, I picked ‘em up, go back into the airport Lost and Found, what do I do?  
 
Well, “Leave ‘em with us and give us your name and address.” ‘Course, they knew me, but give’ em that 
information. “Nobody claims ‘em in three months, they’ll be yours.”  Said, “Oh, okay.” And so I went 
back to the Lost & Found office three months later, and I said “Here I am,” to get it. And they said, “Well, 
did you advertise it?”  And, course, I’m thinking seven-letter words.  I don’t swear anymore.  Didn’t 
swear then.  I don’t swear anymore, but I’m thinking seven-letter words.  And, um, oh, it turns out that I 
have to advertise in a paper of whre it’s likely to be noticed, or in a city where it’s likely to be noticed.  
Well, they were found in Portland, so I advertised in Portland.  Put in in their Found, and Found didn’t 
cost anything.  And so I did that.  And aw, “Gotta be three months after that.”  So I waited the three 
months after that.  So I came back, and , “Aw, you don’t get ‘em from us, you get ‘em from Downtown.”  
Well, anyway, about SIX months later, those clubs became my possession.  I was able to give ‘em to a 
friend who golfed, cause I don’t golf.  But.  Just rigamarole, and hung around for six months, and nobody 
ever claimed them, so I got ‘em!   
01:18:02 
 
DF:  Wow. 
 
GL:  But they was out in the airport parking lot.   (Debbie, thanks) 
 
DF:  Well, thank you.  This has been great. 
 
GL:  Hope it didn’t. . . Again:  I NEVER exaggerate! 
 
01:18:24 
DF:  What’s a seven-letter word?  I was just counting, and I noticed that “Lincoln” is a seven-letter word 
(laughs). 
 
GL: writes “fucking” on a piece of paper. 
 
DF:  Ahhhhh!   
 
GL:  it’s still, it was because I was in the Marine Corps. In the Marine Corps,  I couldn’t even say, “Pass 
the butter.”  It had to be a swear word in there.  But I no longer say it.  There’s no problem. They run 
through my mind when, difficult times!  Sorry!

Part Two of Gay Lincoln interview: 
 
00:00:05 
DF: I want to get this.  So, the question I’m asking Gay Lincoln is, why, as a passenger service agent, was 
he in the Machinist’s Union?

00:00:11 
GL: We had our separate union, ALEA, Airline Employees Association, and when Northwest bought 
Republic, we had an election.  The Machinist’s union represented Northwest property.  The Mechanics 
and Ramp Agents, ramp agents being people who put cargo on airplanes.  There was another group that 
the unions and the NRLB decided could be part of that union, which were the ticket agents and the 
reservation agents.  And that was highly desirable by the union that won, which was Machinists, that 
theynow had, Machinists’ union now had, not only the machinists, but they also had the ramp workers, 
the ticket agents, public contact, and the reservation agents all under the same umbrella. So that if one 
contract got held up, it would hold up ALL of them.  Numbers.  That’s how I became involved. 
 
DF:  Leverage?   
 
GL:  Numbers.  Now, the company is not , defense, rationalization, the company is not going to pay any 
more than they get from the employee, but every bit of revenue any company receives is from those 
people who work. It’s work that causes revenue. Okay.
