As sung by Miss KITTY O'NEIL and CADET CORPS. 
We are privates in the Sixty-Ninth, 
We follow up the fife and the drum ; 
We can't forget our old comrades, 
And their glory at Bull Run. 
was there with bayonets bristling, 
in the thickest of the fray, 
Whtro the shot and Shell were whistling, 
Our boys help'd gain the day. 
Crronus. 
We march behind the band. 
True sons of Paddy's land, 
The Irish boys for style are excellent; 
The green .above the red, 
'With martial step we tread, 
In th9/gallant Sixty-Ninth Regiment, 
We meant. 
• 
They admit we are the ladies' pride, 
When we're out for a 
grand review, 
They shout huzza, from near and far, 
At our Irish boys so true ; 
With columns solid as a 
wall, 
Bright uniforms neat and clean, 
We are, one and all, sons of Erin, 
From the land of the Shamrock green, 
We march, &c. 
Should America call on her soldier boys, 
lo the ftont we'd boldly go 
For a 
righteous cause, our Nation's laws, 
Give battle to the foe. 
We'll ne'er forget old Ireland, 
But keep our powder dry, 
" 
Faugh a 
ballagh," our cry, clear the way, 
To conquer or to die.

Music by DAVE BRATIAM.

Down Broadway." 
We're unfortunate men as you can see, 
Depending on your charity; 
We live on the street, we live in jail, 
The bread we ate is always stale— 
Pity the beggars, oh do! 
Unable to work, not willing to die, 
Watching the rich walk proudly by, 
We wouldn't steal the weight of a 
pin— 
Have pity on these beggar min— 
Pity the beggars, oh do! 
CHORUS. 
The blind,- the lame, the sick, the sore, 
Getting our bread from door to door, 
Exposed to the rain, to the snow, the wind—;`4 
Pity these beggar men! 
When the leaves are falling from the trees, 
We shiver wid the lightest breeze ; 
The Christmas gift that we receive 
Is the God-forsaken pauper's grave; 
Pity the beggars, oh do ! 
But when bright summer comes around, 
On every corner* 
they were found ; 
Policemen then they do begin, 
To drive away these beggar min— 
Pity the beggars, oh do! 
The blind, the lame, km. 
We've plenty faith, we live on hope— 
We never saw the sight of soap ; 
At night we softly lay our bones 
Upon a 
bed of mud and stones; 
Pity the beggars, oh do I 
In the morning, out we creep, 
After enjoying a 
pleasant sleep ; 
We're always fat and never thin— 
Its peculiar to these beggar min— 
Pity the beggars, oh do! 
The blind, the lame, Jrio.

We are a 
gang of snoozers 
Suffering from the heat— 
From ten days long imprisiment— 
We're turned out in the street 
To beg and starve, and steal our hash, 
And go without our lush ; 
Oh ! send us up to Blackwell's Isle, 
And give us back our mush.

We ask you in heartbroken volt°, 
To give us all Ten Days!

And sometimes on the grass ; 
We're bums of the dirtiest water, 
Policemen let us pass ; 
We brighten all the railings 
Of the Public Parks ; you know 
Its there we set, ' till a 
heavy wet 
Compels us for to go. 
Snoozers, &c. 
When we die, in Potter's field 
They'll throw these poor old vags; 
We leave to the corporation 
These bundles of old rags ; 
We'll never have no monuments 
Like Shakespeare, Scott or Burns; 
These bums, they'll roll into a 
hole, 
Among the bugs and worms.

My Old Kentucky Home, ClocJ-Night. 
Magic, with Piano Forte Accompaniment, published by :Messrs. Firth, 
Pond & 
Co., New York. 
THE sun shines bright in the old Kentucky home; 
'Tis summer, the darkies are gay, 
The corn-top's ripe and the meadows in the bloom, 
While the birds make music music all the day. 
The young folks roll on the little cabin floor, 
All merry, all happy and bright; 
By-' n-by hard times comes a-knocking at the door— 
Then my old Kentucky home, far away. 
CHO/SUS. 
Weep DO more, my lady, 
Oh ! weep no more to- day; 
We will sing one song for the old Kentucky home, 
For the old Kentucky home, far away. 
They hunt no more for the possum and the coon 
On the meadow, the hill, and the shore; 
They sing no more by the glimmer of the moon, 
On the bench by the old cal)in door. 
The day goes by like a 
shadow o'er the heart, 
With sorrow where all was delio-ht, 
The time has come when the darkies have to part, 
Then my old Kentucky home, good-night. 
Weep no more, 
C. 
The head must bow and the back will have to bend, 
Wherever the darkey may go; 
A 
few more days and the trouble all will end 
In the field where the sugar canes grow; 
A 
few more days for to tote the weary load— 
No matter, ' twill never be light; 
A 
few more days till we totter on the road, 
Then my old Kentucky home, good- night!

Longshoreman's Strike; Or, The Poor Man's' 
Family, • 
Words by ED. HARRIGAN. 
Music by DATE BRAHAM. 
Sling by ED. HARRIGAN, in his side splitting sketch, " Raffle for a 
Clock.” 
OH! I 
am a 
simple, laboring man, 
I 
work along the shore, 
To keep the hungry wolves away 
From the poor ' longshoreman's door; 
I 
toil all day in the broiling sun 
On the ships that come from sea, 
From broad daylight till late at night 
For a 
poor man's family. 
CHORUS. 
Give us fair pay for every day 
Is what we ask of ye ; 
Our cause is right, 
We are out on a 
strike 
For a 
poor man's family. 
Oh ! the rich ones gilded carriages 
And horses swift and strong., 
Whin a 
poor man asks for a 
bite to eat 
They tell him he is wrong; 
Go take your shovel in your hand, 
Go out and work for me; 
Die or live they have nothing to give 
To a 
poor man's family. 
Give us, &C. 
They bring over their Italians 
And Chinamen from the South, 
Thinking they can do our work, 
Take the bread from out our mouths; 
The white man's children they must ht rve, 
Slitu'e we w:11 not agree 
To be put down like a 
worm in the ground, 
And starve our family. 
Give us, rke. 
Written and sung by ED. HanntoAN, in Harrigan dc Hart's 
sketch, " Who Owns the Line.” 
ME name is Mike Malony, 
I'm a 
carpenter by trade; 
I 
married Molly Higgins, 
Who all my trouble made. 
She'd as many of relations 
As fishes in the sea; 
They ate me out of house and home, 
And destroyed me ' tunny. 
CIIORUS. 
There's her father, 
And her mother, 
And ner sister, 
And her brother. 
1700 babies laying on their knees, 
Her uncles and her cousins, 
And aunties by the dozen 
Lived upon the earnings of Patrick Malony. 
My pants would fit her uncle, 
Her dress would fit her niece; 
I 
have to sleep upon the roof; 
Or I 
never have no peace. 
They made me buy them dainties, 
Root beer by the pail; 
rd have to"wait ' till they were fa 
Before I'd git me male. 
CHORUS. 
There was pudding, 
There was mutton 
That would make you burst a 
button, 
And a 
fiery- head Corkonian 
By the name ot Pat Cloney, 
To superintend the table, 
To put me in the stable 
While they ate up all the labor of Patrick May, 
Her uncle wore my stockings, 
My hat would fit his head; 
When tired out wid labor 
They'd kick me out of bed. 
I 
put up every pinny 
For to keep them from Bellevue, 
I 
Wish the coroner would sit 
On my wife and all her crew. 
CHORUS. 
There's her nephews 
And her nieces 
That come from several places, 
1700 grandmothers 
And mothers-in-law you see; 
A 
wagon load of Daiys; 
McSweegan and the Halys 
Lived on the earnings of Patrick Malolly. '1 
There's her second cousin's brother, 
And his toothless old step-mother, 
An1 1600.emigrants from Ireland you see. 
Wid their boxes and their bedding, 
On my Ingrain carpet treading, 
They lived upon the earnings of Patrick Malony.: 
There's the Brad ,)s 
And the Gradys— 
Dacent perfect ladies, 
Always axing charity 
From my family you see. 
One husband was a 
loafer, 
The other was a 
toper, 
Depending on the friendship of Patrick Malony.

The Controlling Influence of Drink. 
A 
Humorous Recitation by ED. HARRIGAN. 
IN a 
tenement brick, 
Where the families were thick. 
Lived McMullen, a 
poor little tailor, 
Although he was small 
At a 
party or a 
ball, 
lie was nimble and light as a 
sailor. 
As a 
man, he was quiet. 
Kept out of a 
riot, 
ll's nose was red as a 
pink, 
And when he got full, 
lie was like a 
mad bull, 
From the controlling influence of drink. 
Whin the war begun 
Ile followed the drum, 
In the Sixty-ninth Regiment, a 
soldier, 
lie went to the front 
The rebels to hunt, 
The devil a 
troop more bolder. 
When lie marched in the light 
McMullen was tight, 
lie never took time to think— 
He was shot in the head 
And left there for dead, 
From the controlling influence of drink. 
McMullen had pluck, 
That's no use without luck, 
And whin they sent him to cook for the nagers, 
His spirit arose, 
He put his thumb to his nose 
Saying I'd see you in h—ll first, be jabers. 
In a 
cell he was put 
Twenty-two pounds to the link— 
Whin they let him go 
Oh his health was so low 
From the controlling influence of drink.

Whin McMullen got home 
He was all skin and bone. 
'Pon mesowlthe poor little fellow was a 
failing. 
The doctor came in and says he 
Give him plenty of gin, 
For that's where tile tailor is ailing. 
He swallowed a 
guar:— 
His life was beginning to sink, 
More gin thin he cried, 
Rolled over and died 
From the controlling influence of drink.. 
Oh 1 
the liquor and cake 
That rolled in at the wake, 
'Twould fill up a 
confectionary. 
The neighbors kim in 
To take the last look at him, 
Who'd a 
smile on his face like a 
fairy 
Wid sobs and wid sighs 
And tears in their eyes, 
They gave one another the wink, 
And slobbering, said 
I'm tould that he's dead, 
From the controlling influence of drink. 
There's a 
nate little spot 
Beyant in a 
Calvary lot, 
Where the poor little tailor was burled 
And carriages fine 
And sojers in line, 
In a 
boat cross the river was ferried. 
They stood round the grave, 
And many's the sigh they gave 
As the dirt was shoveled up to the brink. 
And on the tombstone 
Was died atone 
From the controlhng influence of drink. 
A 
Humorous Recitation by ED. HARRIGAN. 
CHEESE pards, I'll give it out straight, 
how I 
dropped down to a 
bum, 
Don't lay it altogether, rocks, 
On whisky, gin and rum. 
Put some of it to good nature, 
I 
was allus ripe and meller, 
I 
loved company, 'deed I 
did, 
They said I 
was a 
good feller, 
Have a 
ball, no mixey pards, 
I 
his't no more this year, 
Go in and get your load, 
But don't say I 
gave you a 
steer 
I'm agin ' em shure, bet on me, 
On the avenue or In a 
cellar, 
lye drank enough to swim a 
ship, 
That's when I 
was a 
good fellow. 
You're young, fresh, full of chin, 
You've got to keep up your lick, 
There's a 
way to get out of it soon, 
'There aint much need of a 
kick 
Stay home and study figures, 
It's an old thing for me to bellow, 
Studying Hoyle was solid for me, 
That's when I 
was a 
good fellow. 
Mother's sick, ah, that's tough. 
You say you're her only kid, 
Don't use the old woman rough, 
Might get a 
stepmother instead. 
If you aint flowing I'm lying. 
You start like a 
steam propeller, 
Boy, you'll do a 
heap of that crying, 
If you stick to being a 
good fellow, 
I've a 
few scads, aint on the borrow, 
I 
was broke, I 
struck the gang, 
They give me the old I'm sorry, 
That's charity done up in slang, 
'They said that I 
was a 
good un, 
When a 
muss sprung up I'd quell her, 
My head been as big as a 
pudden. 
It come from being a 
good fellow. 
That's all the advice I'm giving, 
You take it, I

Save money, you'll get a

What, me? I'll get long, don't worry,

I'm done being a

THERE'S a

That's sweet enough to ate, 
Whin filled up wid tobacco 
'Twould put a 
man to slope. 
'Twos introduced in Ireland 
In the days of Brian Borhue. 
I'd rather lose my life, my boys, 
Than lose my honey-dew. 
Some call it Cavendish, 
Or any name you'd wish. 
And they dale it out in plug, you know. 
When it is fresh and green, 
When from my work I 
tire 
I 
set down by the fire, 
An' I 
watch the smoke roll up and curl, 
From Lly 1:tie ould Duddeen. 
Cuont-s. 
My duddeen you are so sweet to me, 
I 
love to see your smoke go up 
Whin I 
get through my tea. 
My dualeen, you are in the faraiIy, 
I'd surely die if I 
found out 
You were stole away from me. 
rye have studied hist.cry, 
Ye'll read where William Plan 
Bought the state of l'innsylvania. 
From the ,wild red Injin men, 
lie never used 
sword or gun 
When he met them face to face, 
But they all 
down contintal, 
And they smoked the pipe of peace. 
If ye'd only take a 
puff, 
Shure one would be enough 
To put you in a 
slumber, 
A 
stupor, or a 
dream. 
Ye might say it's not ginteel, 
But so beautiful I 
feel 
Whin I 
sit down in the corner, boys, 
Wid my little culd Duddeen. 
My Duddeen, 
A 
Frenchman smokes the little thing 
They call the cigarette, 
It makes him feel uneasy, 
As he blows, and puffs, and frets. 
The Chinese smoles the opium, 
'Till it puts him in a 
doze. 
And the Yankee smokes the bad cigar, 
W 
id one end to his nose. 
But every Irishman— 
Bould Patsey, Mike or Dan, 
That was born in dear old Ireland, 
Where the grasses grow so green, 
If they've no coat to their back, 
Tney've that bit of clay so black; 
It's a 
consolation to them, 
Is the little old Duddeen.

OH, its lately I've missed her, 
Shure I 
mane me sister; 
She's strong as a 
bull, 
And she strikes t 
hard blow. 
Her cheeks they are rosey, 
And nate as the posey; 
At the big Castle Garden 
She landed below. 
CHORUS. 
Oh say, have you seen her, 
To you I'd describe her,— 
She wears a 
red petticoat, 
And a 
hat on her head; 
She moves whin she's walking, 
She spakes whin she's talking; 
An' her petticoat is marked 
0, P, Q, X, Y, R, Z. 
She comes out wid my cousin; 
count them by the dozens; 
I'm forced for to think 
They have led her astray. 
For some information 
I'd suffer starvation; 
25 
Swear oft against whisfety, • 
Drink nothing but tay: 
On her cheek there's a 
dimple, 
On her nose there's a 
pimple: 
Her fut's very small— 
Sure she wears No. 10. 
She was the lady 
That fought Mrs. Brady, 
At home in Mayo 
She could whip all the men. 
She'd sing like a 
fairy, 
Or any canary, 
She never was standing 
Wbinever she set. 
Like old Neptune's daughter, 
She'd fall in the water, 
She'd come out like a 
herring, 
She'd never get wet. 
She was sober when drinking, 
When aslape she was thinking• 
Sne was:delicate and soft 
As the wild buffalo. 
She'd a 
hand like a 
sailor 
On ooard of a 
whaler; 
Her name is McSwegan, 
From the county :nap.

THANKSGIVING day has come at last, 
And we mareh in the grand parade; 
As the drums do beat and the pipes do play 
We 
feel that we are made; 
The people cry and shout " huzza !" 
As we gallantly pass by; 
With a 
stiff upper lip we keep in step, 
And wave our flags on high. 
Caor.us. 
March time, march we hear, 
And forward march we go; 
We grasp our guns while stars and stripes 
Wave nobly to and fro ; 
The Shanghai Musketeers ! 
The Shanghai Musketeers ! 
We jolly boys do march away 
In the Shanghai Musketeers. 
Our nobby suits and flashing guns, 
Such splendid marching, too; 
The people wondered and would say 
Oh! what a 
handsome crew; 
 ,iieti14134644,41/
4414::.at 
When e'er we would receive a 
prize 
Our Captain, ' mid loud cheers 
Would bow profound and then give thanks 
For the Shanghai Musketeers. 
March time, &c,, 
When up the Boulevard we did go 
To shoot for prizes there, 
And after that to dinner went 
And, oh ! such a 
grand affair; 
Roast chicken, pork and beans, and ham, 
Wines, whiskey, all kinds of beers, 
Long life as a 
toast was given 
For the Shanghai Musketeers. 
March time, & c. 
At last toward home we march again 
A 
singing all the way; 
We couldn't keep straight to save our necks, 
And the band too drunk to play; 
When we reached home in the morning 
We were frisky as young steers; 
Thus ended the glorious first parade 
Of the Shanghai Musketeers.

ONE night I 
was walking along when I 
saw 
A 
poor little boy in the street, 
His face it was covered with tears and dirt, 
And no shoes on his poor little feet, 
He stopped me and asked me for twenty-five cents, 
Said he had not eaten food all the day, 
I 
said, where's your mother? 
EL stammered and said, my mother Las gone out to pray, 
CHORUS. 
The fire has gone out, we've nothing to eat, 
And Sammy's been crying all day, 
Who'll give nae some money to buy us some bread? 
}for my mother has gone out to pray. 
She says that the men are so wicked you know, 
And giving their minds up to drink, 
And now she has joined the crusader's band, 
And they're making things lively I 
think, 
For father cap% get any whisky down town,. 
So he brought home a 
bottle to-day, ' 
4,nd he's blind staving drunk in the woodshed behind, 
While my mother has gone out to pray. 
The fire has gone out, etc, 
She left me at home to take care of the boys, 
And they're screaming and squalling so queer, 
And Tommy ft- 11 on to the stove while ago, 
And nearly burnt off all his e 
r, 
And the baby fell o 
it of the cradle and cryed, 
And the very old deuce wai to pay, 
For the grub is 1:teked, and we've nothing to eat 
Since my mother has gone out to pray. 
The fire has gone out, eto. 
I 
gave him some money to buy him some bread, 
And I 
thought all the women a 
bore, 
For the men tlleir bottles will fill on the sly, 
And for meannesi they'll drink all the more; 
They'd better stay home and take care of their house, 
And not leave their children alt day, 
For there's many an urchin a 
crying for bread. 
While his mother has gone out to pray,

The fire has gone out, eta.

She's as wild as the uncaught panther, 
And as gentle and as light as the deer, 
She's a 
merry little laugh like the tinkle 
Of a 
sweet- toned silver bell, 
And a 
pair of wicked eyes with a 
twinkle, 
As black as the wild gazelle. 
She's a 
wink and a

While in company with some friends 
Of ours, the other night, 
And the glorious time we had, 
It filled us with delight ; 
But during the evening, one of' my friends 
Was anxious for to know, 
What we thought of Europe ? 
And if ever back we'd go ? 
When Gus Williams walks a 
rope, 
And Tony Pastor is made a 
Pope, 
And all the Ladies have a 
vote, 
And Lager cease to flow; 
When Ned Harrigan and Tony Hart, 
To make a 
living, must drive a 
cart 
When this occurs, and not till then, 
Will we to Europe go. 
My friends they thought it kind of strange 
To hear me speak this way. 
They thought it was a 
glorious place 
To pass the time away. 
It rains there both day and night; 
A 
fine day you seldom see ; 
The Sun, likewise the Moon and Stars, 
They seem not to be free. 
"When Billy Barry is Emperor of France, 
And Frank Gerard has learned to dance, 
And Larry Tooley, should by chance, 
As fat as Stewart grow; 
When Frank. Kerns makes a 
leap for life; 
And Monkey George never gets tight, 
And Emma Day marries George ralight : 
Then we'll to Europe go.

IDLING THE TIME AWAY. 
Sung by JOED1 FIELIMG. 
If you have health, if you have wealth, 
If you intend to enjoy yourself; 
If you want pleasure, if you want sport, 
Just take a 
trip to New York; 
Walk through the City, 
'There you'll find pictures I 
think of every kind, 
If you feel weary, not up to the mark, 
'Then take a 
gentle walk through the Park. 
Cnop.ts. 
There you can lie beneath the trees, 
Enjoying yourself with the greatest of ease, 
Wink at the girls just as you please, 
Idling the time away. 
You feel se jolly lighthearted and gay; 
Perhflps to a 
girl these words you say :— 
I 
mean to enjoy myself to day, 
Whate'er the expenses may be ; 
You treat her to one or two bottles of beer, 
Then you get spooney—call her your dear, 
Say that you love her, .to her you'll be true--
In fact, anything in this worli say you'll lo. 
There you can lie, &e. 
1 
You slay there perhaps some hours, 
Watching the bees, the birds, and the flowers, 
Exercising all your power 
To get her to name the day; 
First she'll say yes, then she'll say no, 
Then she'll say Fred, don't bother me so, 
But if it will please you, it will give me delight. 
To give you an answer going home to-night. 
There you can lie, Anc. 
Beneath the trees no longei- you stay, 
But for home you hasten away, 
Back to the City you return again, 
And see the girl home to her door, 
You kiss her, caress her, squeeze fier Ir.-2.c1 tight, 
And after some talk bid her roa 
Tell her you have an inceme for life, 
And then she'll consent to become your wife.

The mill shut dpwn to-thy, dear wife, 
There's nothing here to eat, 
And look, the boots I've worn a 
year 
Are dropping off my feet ; 
My cloths are hardly decent, wife, 
While you are ragged, too, 
And famine stares us in the face, 
Oh, what are we to do. 
Chonus. 
Oh, what are we to do. dear wife, 
I 
cannot get my pay ; 
The grocer's bill is over due, 
The mill shut down to-day. 
The mill shut down to-day, dear wife, 
The coal is nearly gone. 
And see, there's scarcely wood enough 
To kindle in the morn ; 
The landlord will be coming soon 
To get the rent from you, 
And I 
have not a 
cent to pay 
The bills becoming due. 
Oh, what, 
The mill shut down to-day, dear wife, 
The snow is on the ground, 
And hark ! the piercing winds without 
How mournfully they sound ; 
The children hav6 no shoes to wear, 
They cry for milk and bread, 
But, wife, the mills have stopped to-day, 
How shall we all be fed ?

And Terrence is his name; 
He wears a

And he calls it a " super," and a " slang," 
Oh! my heart is broke, God knows it is,

When he said old man! you're getting too fresh. 
And we'll soon have to put you on ice

And to shut up giving him her slang;

He'll come rolling home, &c. 
Sure, he stands upon the corner 
From morning until night; 
And if the policeman says, " move on," 
He'll spit at him with spite. 
He went to the market only yesterday, 
And there he stole a

As sung by JOHNNY ROACH, the Irish Comic, and DR. Jas. 
L.] HAFER, the greatest Clown of the Northwest. 
The Hero of my humble song 
Was once a 
mighty man. 
A 
shining light in his neighborhood, 
And chief of all his clan; 
But when he found in course of time 
'lhe tricks his friends did play, 
Sure he left them all, and now they cry, 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
CHOKCS. 
He was great and grand, and took command 
01 the boys on Patrick's day ; 
But now the cry is everywhere, 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He won our pride and won our praise, 
And he deserved it too! 
Sure many a 
time tor nights and days 
We stuck to him like glue ; 
He held an office of the State, 
And faith he made it pay; 
But for such a 
place he was too great, 
And nor he's gone away! 
He was great, ko. 
The politicians worshipped him, 
And swore he'd yet be Mayor; 
And tho' the chance looked rather dim, 
He thought it bright and fair; 
But ere he came to rule the town, 
His mind was led astray, 
And now the cry is everywhere, 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He was great, &e:) 
He was as sound a 
Democrat 
As ever filled a 
chair, 
But he lost his great position, 
And it drove him to despair; 
We know not where to seek for him; 
He must have crossed the say ; 
0, it grieves us just to think of it— 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He was great, (W 
He treated us like gintlenaen 
Whenever we did meet ; 
The sight of him would do you good, 
From his head down to his feet; 
He wore a 
collar stiff and high, 
Which made a 
great display; 
He was a 
most distinguished man 
But now he's gone away! 
He was great, &e. 
The girls went crazy when he winked, 
And many an artful plan 
They put in operation for 
To catch this darlin' man; 
But now they're left alone, poor things; 
'1 hey weep and wail, and say— 
Oh, what'll we do at all? 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He was great, &e. 
SKIDMORE'S FANCY BALL! 
Entered according to Act of Congress in the year 1875 by A. J, 
FISHER, in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
By the Original JAMES BRADLEY, at the Theatre Comique, 
514 Broadway, N. Y. 
Keep your eyeballs moving, 
And watch the time of day, 
The Skidmore Guards have joined together, 
To give a 
ball on West Broadway! 
But I 
understand they'll have a 
band, 
A 
clarionet and base drum, 
The loons will smile and walk a 
mile, 
To have a 
good night's fun! 
CHORUS. 
The band will play 
In the key of A, 
As the Wenches promenade the Hall, 
Plain Quadrilles— 
That would give a 
man the chills— 
At the Skidinore's Fancy Ball ! 
Captain Brown he will be there, 
With a 
boiled shirt, stiffened with starch ! 
He'll put on airs and kick around chairs, 
When he does lead the march 
With Angelina Neversmile by his side; 
Who's eyes would stop a 
clock ! 
When Intermission comes, 
He falls in with the hums, 
And takes a 
walk around the block. 
As sung by SoL Salmi RussELL. 
Oh, dear! I'm. nearly starving,

I 
fancy myself carving; 
Big pies and joints of meat. 
Roast pork or leg of mutton, 
To me would be of use ; 
And thow„.

Still, I'd polish off a 
goose

Within our home garden we had a 
sweet bud 
That promised to blossom in love, 
So deep had its tendrils grown into our hearts, 
We thought that our father above 
Would spare him to solace the last of our years; 
Alas ! he is stolen away! 
And now we are mourning for our darling child, 
We watch, and we wait, and we pray.

THE other night I 
went to bed, 
In fact, I 
often do, 
And in my sleep, went down to the deep, 
Where a 
strange world met my view ; 
This world was called Concordia, 
Its peopic gay and free, 
I 
wished that I 
were one of them, 
Fifty inile.s under the sea, 
cnouus. 
This is what I 
saw when dreaming, 
As plain, a plain could be, 
They were oh s.) content, they never paid rent 
Fifty miles under the sea. 
Their food and drink was pure, and not 
Adulterated stuff, 
They'd DO Guod Templars, for they knew 
When they'd just had enough. 
They'd no " blues," partial to running in, 
No Divorce Court had they got, 
And they never read " The Englishman,' 
0 ! they were a 
happy lot. 
CHOnns. 
This is what I 
saw when dreaming, 
As plain, as plain could e 
They'd ne'er had an " Odger," no claimant" Sir Rogec't 
Piny miles under the sea. 
They'd never had a 
rwional debt, 
They never were troubled with wars, 
They never had a 
man for the rates 
Come knock, knock, knock at their door3; 
The toothache, income tax, and corns 
They knew not—happy souls! 
Of railway smashes they'd ne'er heard, 
Nor the price of a 
ton of coals. 
CHORE'S. 
This is what I 
saw when dreaming, 
As plain, as plain could be, 
You may doubt my tale, they'd no workhouse nor jarl, 
Fifty miles under the sea. 
Never a 
one had been known to dread 
The approach of quarter day, 
The min hers- in-law all lived by themselves 
Tin thousand mil. s 
away ; 
No pater was troubled with millim is' bills, 
Their children ne'er numbered a 
score, 
You may think it strange, it was wisely arranged 
That. each should have two and no more. 
CHORUS. 
This is what I 
saw when dreaming, 
As plain, as plain could be, 
I 
then heard a 
knock, and it's past ten o'clock, 
I 
came up then from under the sea.

THAT'S WHERE WE BOTH GRAB GROUND 
By NED HARRIGAN, for Walters & Morton. 
WE'RE a

We're honey from the comb, 
We twist our legs in reel or jig, 
And dislocate the bone. 
Our undertanding are immense, 
Just listen to the sound, 
We've got a 
heap of common sense, 
That's where we both grab ground.

So watch this curlicue, [ Srwr.) 
Oh ain't it fun for you, [ SYmP.] 
For with a 
bound we bounce around, 
That's where we both grab ground. 
The peculiar vibrations, 
That's just below the knee, 
Causes a 
sensation 
Which creates a-jility, 
It raises dust and makes a 
noise, 
And lays things loose around, 
Here's what knocks— electric shocks, 
That's where we both grab ground.

To say a

We're not from Cork. but the City Dublin;

In Ireland to-day, in almost any part, 
You'll find many the man equally as smart. 
But the Government that rules won't let them rise, 
So what they possess, of course with them dies. 
Some, who's good fortune is to get to New York,

!ATTE TEMPLE, joyed with her in her early pleasures, gym-) 
pathized and wept with her in her sorrows, and glowed 
with indignation at the wrongs which she suffered from 
base, calculating villains, an opportunity is afforded of 
reading one of the most absorbing works ever written, 
proving " truth stranger than fiction." 
The poet's lines are but a 
just description of the unfor# 
laznate Charlotte Temple: 
Her form was faultless, and her mind, 
Unta!ntrd set by srt, • 
Was noble, just, humane and kind, 
And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ah 1 
the cruel spider came—" 
This bock, in the language of Mrs. Rowson, " affords es 
ibtriking example that vice, however prosperous in the be-
ginning, in the end leads only to misery and shame."

THE DAUGHTER OF CHARLOTTE TEMPLE. 
No cue who has read the touching account of the 
misfortunes of Charlotte Temple, with that absorb-
ing interest which is inseparable rrom :Am Row-
son's writings, can rest satisfied whae denying them-
selves a 
perusal cf the life of Charlotte Temple's 
Daughter, Lucy L-,itple. 
It is a 
sequel possessed of all the thrilling in-
terest that characterizes the life of the -unfortunate 
mother, while it exemplifies in a 
wonderful manner 
" 
the visitation of the sins of the parents upon the 
children." 
It depicts sorrows that refuse the balm of sym-
pathy, and consolations which those arcund. us 
" 
can neither give nor take awey." 
It contrasts in 
living colors the idlest fruits of -virtue and happi-
ness on the one hand, caid the bitter end, blighting 
disappointments -ind 
ir resulting from once yi1-
ing to the seductive intaeLce of passion. 
It points a 
moral that commends it to the atten-
tion of all, and. -
is pervaded by an interest that will 
hold the reader in ra.pi attention to the end.

The New

A 
little book has 1 
tely appeared in print at Messrs. Psher 
Denison's, 98 Nassa 
street, called "The Little Flirt." We 
cannot 
say that we recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, 
r 
s 
we think it would only encourage the bad habit of " flirting,'' 
Unfortunately there is enough of it done without any :urther neetKI% 
sity of explaining 'how, when and where to do it,' and this little 
volume would advise and initiate the uncorrupted in practising what 
ts commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: 
We have lately seen a 
neat little book, bound in morocco, costing 
25 cents, called "The Little Flirt," published by Messrs. Fisher 
Denison, 98 Nassau street. 
It gives information of the modus oper-
andi of flirting, and of the meaning of every motion of the hand-
kerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As there is nothing at all cbjec-
tdonahle in the volume, and its contents might afford some innocent 
amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recommend it to out 
young lady and gentlemen readers.

By OLIVER BYRNE.

ENDORSEMENTS OF THE PRESS. 
The highest praise NviiM1 can be given to this excellent 
elementaiy work on prlet.cal mechanics, consists in the fol-
lowing simple statement of facts : '!' ho editor of this journal, 
while tea..ning natural philosophy and chemit,try in the 
Cooder Institute from 1859 to J884, was in need of a 
text-
bAo of practical in , chanics, adapted to the advanced classes 
who htd been trained in niathenntlics ; in his search among 
the many mechanieal t. xt-books, there was not one which so 
fully answered his r . quirements as the above work. 
It was 
theref )re adopted and used with perfect satisfaction, and it 
is with pleasure that he receives it now as an old friend from 
the publishers, gives it his most ea.-nest recommendation, 
an''. wishes it in the hands of all who are still in the fog about 
th:' units of work, calculation of the power of machinery, 
rel.:stance to motion, strain on material, etc.—Manufacturer 
and Builder, July, 1874. 
IThe author of this work is well known as an extensive 
w-
dter who has r_lade some valuable additions to American 
technical literature, enumerated above in detail. 
The work 
we are now noticing is a 
theoretical treatise on practical me-
chanics, designed to supply a 
recognized deficiency. 
Most 
of the work; on mechanics treat the subject in a manner 
which is not available to young men commencing as appren-
tices in shops. 
Any young man with a 
fair knowledge of 
arithmetic may, however, use this work to great advantage ; 
it is not only suitable for a 
text-book, but also as a wrok 
of reference. 
Most ambitious young men will make them-
selves so familiar with its contents as to be able to afer 
readily to any portion of the book. 
The author has adopted 
a 
new notation to distinguish units of work from other units, 
which is not without value, and might be advantageously 
introduced into more ambitious works. 
The book is well 
printed on good white piper. and bound in stiff cloth covers.
